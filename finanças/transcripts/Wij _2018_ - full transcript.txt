My dad always did it like this. And then the Vanlangendonck scandal. In Antwerp the sensational trial begins today. The Prosecution demands The jury... The court. The witness may take the stand. May I ask you to take the oath, with your right hand risen. I swear to speak without hate and without fear. To tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. What is your name and first name? Hey. - Hey. Simon, is something wrong? What are you thinking about? About Femke. Is that the girl from the trial? Yes. What was she like? Femke was lovely... ...gentle... She protected me. Even from myself. And the rest? Where did you live? I lived in Wachtebeke, a small border town. There were eight of us. Belgian and Dutch. It was summer. For the first time in years it really felt like summer. We were never thinking... None of us was. We thought we knew everything better. Jens was my best friend. Simon, look. I broke your record. And then there was Ruth. Ruth liked to show off. She wasn't tough at all. Even though she thought otherwise. The one that was tough was Liasl. She knew everything better. Even better than Thomas. Femke... Femke was beautiful. Gorgeous. She was always in good spirits. The best thing about Femke was, that she was the opposite of me. Look, it's Karl and all his racket. Then there was Karl. He was the macho. He would rather crack his skull open than give way to someone. And Ena? Is she still coming? She's so slow. She's always late. Wait until she's sitting on top of you. Thomas mostly wanted to top his father. And he had seriously made it, believe me. The last one was Ena. She's impossible to describe. You have to meet Ena, undergo her. Cheeky, sexy. but sweet as well. There were four boys and four girls. That's who WE were. Wait for Jens. I'm going to film this. Wait a second. Why? Wait, I'm gonna film this. - What? All these people. Zoom in. - Why are you filming this? Can you shoot slow motion as well? Look at all those ugly faces. Hey, retards. Look at them, working from nine to five. They're like ants. Femke, they're looking at you. That car swerved out of its lane. Did you film it? Come on, you always film the wrong things. Really. Kari, where did you learn to ride a moped? It's nice out here. It's about 800 meters and we're there. Can't you tell more? It was a weird summer. We wanted to discover the world. And had no time to lose. Kari... Karl found the perfect place where we could be who we were. Look around, no one comes here. They were gonna make a residential area here. But they didn't because of the financial crisis. Are you ready for the mansion, guys? - Check if there's someone in there first. It's really nice! - Do you like it? Yeah, definitely. Kari, super nice man, fuck. - Super cool. But, what were you doing here, so far away? - Yeah. how did you find this? Hey boys, I'll see you in a bit. Stop. I can talk backwards. Show me. On evol I. - What? I love you. Jesus. I can do something with my tongue. Do it. You can touch me, if you want. Were you in love? Yes, very much so. I think I will never be in love like that again... as I was with her. Sometimes it's like I can still smell her. The sex glowed on our cheeks like the summer sun. We aroused the girls and they aroused us. The hormones exploded out of our ears. And you joined in? - Yes. This one. - No, that's gonna hurt, man. That's no fun. This one. That one's pretty small. I think it's good. Yes, Ena. You'll never gum this one. - Wanna bet? It's a good one. It's not an easy one. Number one of the game, Ena. - Hit me. Hold on. Ready... Set... Okay, Pritt stick? - That wasn't on the table. That's not the 'number one Ena'. come on. - Okay, okay, okay. Chicken leg? No, lighter. Wasn't that hard, was it? - Again. You'll never gum this one. Smaller objects are harder. A dick? - No, first gum who's. Vladimir Poetin? - No, again. Hold on. Fuck, your hands are cold. Come on, guess. Okay, Simon? Okay, double penetration. It was childlike. It was all about pleasure. Who can piss the furthest? Who can come the quickest? Who dares to go the fastest? How can we earn the most money? Websites can reach the whole world. And a website with nudes on it? Nude pictures are worthless these days. You can just google them. - What about video's? I don't want my face on the internet. Everyone can see it. Even my dad. You could just wear a mask? Make yourself unrecognizable. I don't want my face on the internet. Yeah, I wanna have a life after this. Make a good codeword. There are other ways to make money. Not in two months, unless we win the lottery. If we all work really hard for two months... ...we can do whatever we want in our own apartment. What did you do with all that money? Money? It was like we had millions. We bought everything. The most expensive things we could get. Watches, mopeds, clothes... We only had to make sure our parents didn't notice. One day Thomas said: Let's go to Ibiza. And we left that same day. The most expensive tickets, hotels and restaurants. It was amazing. The sky was the limit. Didn't your parents question anything? They never suspected a thing. I'm hungry. Simon, you have to learn how the world works. Hello, Mr. Vanlangendonck. - Hello, Vera. We don't mean to disturb you, we are here to say... ...you have our support as aspirant mayor. You know Simon, my son. Yes, yes. Still top of the class, Simon? He's not allowed to vote yet, but you got mine... ...and his as well, in a year or two. - Splendid, splendid. With raspberries. Oh Vera, that's my favourite. Thank you. Thank you. In a town where psychopaths attack babies something is seriously wrong. Yes. And the breakup of Belgium is also welcome. Of course and we are going to take care of that. Alright. - Enjoy the pie. Thank you, Vera. Bye, Simon. Goodbye, Mr. Vanlangendonck. - Goodbye. Was that really necessary? - Yes. Tell me if it becomes too much. - No, I want to know. We all took pan. Femke and I too. It all started in my father's loft. He's much younger than my mum. I'll help you. - No, it's fine. Thanks for letting us come here. - You're welcome. What an invasion, it's a whole film crew. Looks like a serious school project. How's mum doing? - If you wanna know, why don't you call her? And, between you and Guy? Do you guys get along? - Yeah. he's a great guy. Okay, Tarantino. If he knew what we all did... Jens? Camera all set up? - Yes, and so are the lamps. That's much better, Simon. - Yeah. Can we go together? - Hey, gay boy. Women want some as well, right? Hey, would you like to... Femke, you sit on top of Karl. Yeah, face the camera and then just ride him a bit. You have to put your hands like this. - And just join in. You can have this sausage. - And action. Come on, stay professional. A bit slower, please. Liesl, use your hands. Grab that dick. Go, Liesl. - Ruth, get over here. I'm gonna do a double facial. Quick, I'm almost gonna come. Okay, suck my balls. Suck my balls. Action, guys. Yeah, this is perfect. Liesl, moan. Moan. Guys, moan. Come on. She looks like a muppet. Jens, is my dick in frame? - Yeah. it's perfect. Don't you think we're going too far? I don't know, and you? Do you think of me when you fuck other guys? Yeah, I think so. Can I ask you something weird? - Yes. Is Ena fighter than me? - No. Nothing feels better than my Eiffel Tower in your Eurotunnel. I'll take care of it. Wait, you can make your own music with this. I began to doubt whether we were doing the right thing. If I was doing the right thing, if she was. I kept hoping for a signal from her. Something I could grab onto. Something I could log into. But it always remained silent. Thomas had a magnetic effect on her. Everything started to feel... ...Iike a book with a terrible ending. I decided to close that book. It was not my book anymore. Hey. Let's grab that dog. I don't believe you, Ruth. I'm fed up with your lies. I'm not lying. I thought we had to do it. We didn't hurt anybody. - What? You are on trial soon and I don't know if I can handle this. Do you think my life is easy? I asked you something. - Mum. Goddammit, will you let me finish? Somewhere else with your thoughts? There they are. Show your pussies. Ruth? Na? Will you set the table? - I won't be having dinner. I have to babysit tonight. - I thought that was at eight? Yeah. Then you can join us for dinner, right? It's all different in my head, mum. It wasn't about sex. It felt like I was standing above the world. All those middle-class people... ...in their square houses and square gardens. Ruth. Ruth, can you hear me? It's all just so fucking predictable. Ruth, are you coming? Darn it, what's keeping you? What? - I asked you to set the table. I was listening to music. I couldn't hear you. And you were always so predictable, too. What about homework tonight?' What about homework? I'm glad you're babysitting tonight. You'll be doing something useful that way. Yeah... Hey, calm down. I felt like a nobody. I was... ...that boring person with that extremely dull fucking life. But within our group at least something was happening. And for once I excelled in something. I turned men on. They got homy because of my body, and I was in control. And with my eyes closed they might have been Simon. Karfs dad with my mum. No, that's a whole lot of hair. Yeah, or my dad and your mum. Gross. That's definitely not a match. - How would they fuck? My dad, with a cracking voice. Yeah, dirty bitch. Yikes. How are your parents doing? They fight a lot. I was very annoyed, mum... ...by those ugly faces. They resembled a great desolation. And to me, you were one of them. They're gone. Dumbasses. What the fuck are you doing? Ena. You can't do that. What? - What's that? Have a taste. - This one is really good. What is this? Look. - They play Bridge with their neighbours. What a life. That's true happiness. Like this? - Yes. Wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna take pictures. We'll put them on his computer. Mr. Lampe. I was expecting boxer shorts. It comes with a hat. Awesome. I'm Ena, and I am from Russia. Oh, Mrs. Lamps No. Mrs. Lamps doesn't want to today, Mr.Lampe. She's not in the mood. - What a shame. Hey, but... ...have you spoken to Simon lately? - No. You don't wanna talk about it? No. You really like him, don't you? - Yes. Okay, let's try this one. It's a hard one, though. Not that one. - No. That one. - No. Ya, come on. - I can't do that. Yes, handstand. You have to take it seriously. People will notice when we're messing around. Okay, sorry. It has to build-up otherwise people don't get horny. And they will leave our pom-site. - My knee hurts. How are things with Femke? - Super. I meant between the two of you. Also fine, we're amusing ourselves. I could see you grow old together. I dared everything, mum. Except telling him I was in love with him. Hey guys, stop fooling around. - What else? We should be making money. Doing this doesn't work. I don't know, if we can hack a bank, but smaller organisations should work. If you can hack a bank you might as well hack Thomas' dad. No, not my dad. We should make our own money. Not someone else's. And definitely not my dad's. - Cash is cash. What do people want. that's hard to get? How could we make some serious money? No idea. - Hair? Hair. Bald men want hair. - Everyone has fucking hair. That's not true. - Bald men don't. How many bald men are there. Liesl? What the fuck. - That's too short. I want a motorcycle. - Listen, there is one thing everybody wants. And that's... Yeah, exactly, a nice pussy. There's only a few of those. Yeah, a lot of horny men will pay for that. Yes, but, that goes too far, doesn't it? Why too far? For money, they can touch me anywhere. Exactly, that's te spirit, baby. Am I hurting you? - You'd have to try harder. Don't go there. Don't touch that. No. Shit. - Damn it. It's all over your trousers. I brought a handkerchief. She's coming. Okay, thanks. Is she out of the car? - Yeah. How was it? - You're officially a whore now. Do you have the money? - Let's go. Fem, it's Bart. - What? That's Ban. Don't look. Hi. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon, how can I help you? Chips with mayo, please. - Yes. Awkward. She was my best friend. But I hated her. Her lips, her smile... She always wanted to be the perfect girl. Everyone wanted her. Even that fucking mayor. Liesl thought of a ritual as a sort of consolation. We all thought of Femke. I did too. How evil am I, mum? I was glad she was dead. Dearly beloved... ...we are gathered here today... ...to bid farewell to Femke Klaassen. A beautiful girl... ...who was snatched away from life in an horrific way. May I ask Ruth to read a poem? About death, he only knew what all knew... What's that Chinese guy doing here? That's one of her customers. That's so inappropriate. - It was in the paper. Yeah, so? But quietly closed its eyes... ...on to unknown faraways. Why didn't you tell us? Because I was afraid you'd only see how evil I was. That you wouldn't understand. And, everyone continued. So I couldn't quit just like that. Finally, men among men. I'm hungry. I know what you're hungry for. Come on, guys. Hello. - Hey, baby. How much are you? - I? I'm not for sale. Everything's for sale. - Five euros for twenty bullets. Five euros for twenty bullets. I can stand here and stare at you like an idiot, but what's the point? I like you. Put your hands in the air. - No, that's not allowed. Put your hands in the air. Surrender. No, listen, why don't we go out and have a drink 'without these morons? Just you and me? I'll pick you up. Promised? We'll have a drink together. Hi. Who are you? Why? Because I think you're pretty. Maybe I was the most deranged. I never liked those girls. Loesje and Sarah? Mum, you don't understand. We were the ones that made it up. Wanna look? - They're really having sex. But he's really old. - Yeah. but he pays. Whose house is this? - Thomas's. Is Thomas old enough to rent a house? - His brother arranged it. In these rooms we receive the customers. What do you think? - Nice. And the neighbours? They don't notice. - Not even all those guys coming over? Do you miss her? Yes. Some things in life you only experience once. Like seeing the sea for the first time. When I saw Femke I knew it was one-off. Fuck, my mother. What? - My mother is here. Your mother? - Yeah. How does she know you're here? - No idea. Did she see me? - Ruth, I knew you'd lie. What am I doing here? What are you doing here? We're going home. We should start our own firm. What do you mean? - An abortion clinic. Handmade abortion ltd. - What's taking her so long? She probably chickened out. There she is. - Ready? She does look a bit pale. - Surprised? Will it work? - If she hits hard enough... I'm sure it's gonna work. Is that enough? Go ahead. Harder. - Hold her still. Do you see anything? - No, there's no blood. Hit harder, Ruth. We can't call a doctor. I don't want to. - You haven't even hit her yet. Goddammit, I have to do everything myself. That's it. Thomas, what the fuck are you doing? That's her head, you moron. Her head. Get a grip. I quit. I stop. I quit. - What's this? I'm quitting. Hi, mum. - Are you at home? Jonas is trying to get in. - Sorry, I didn't see him. I'm so upset. Do you know what I've heard? What? Do you know what happened to the dog of my singing teacher? Your teacher? Some kids drove by, pulled the leash from her hand and took the dog. What did they do to the dog? - They banged it through the streets. Terrible. I will see you at home. Bye-bye. - Bye. I always thought being alone was the worst. But it's even worse... ...to be in a group with people who let you feel you're alone. Liesl, do you know why you're here? Yes, my parents think I'm insane. No, Liesl, wait. As a psychologist it's my job to help you prepare for your testimony in court. I told you, it's a long story. I've got time. Last summer we all wanted to do something different than usual. Something really spectacular. So, we decided to do something... ...outrageous. And I really had control. Over my body and over men. I loved that. Hey, what's the plan, guys? - Let's go swimming. We could go to the pier? - Swimming. No but, seriously. I feel like swimming. - You need to get a tan first, Jens. Ha-ha, how funny, Karl. Let's go mass with those motorists. Yeah, at the bridge. - You mean, like yesterday? Let's do it. Yesterday the teaser and today the full-frontal. Like I said: there's a difference between males and females. The male brain... ...is with an average weight of 390 grams somewhat larger... ...than the female version. Sorry ladies, that's what science tells us. But the part of the brain men use, fits exactly in their glans. You have an extremely big mouth... Yep, I don't even have to open wide. We'll see what happens during the exams, if something relevant comes out. Maybe if I suck really hard, sir. I don't tolerate that kind of language. Take it back, or I'll send you to the principal. Do you want me to explain that joke to the principal? Do you think you can score that way, young lady? Jens, can you see which window? - Yeah. Where? - The left. Left? What floor? First floor, second window. Are they looking? I'm gonna take a picture. I see them. - Yeah, I've got it. Zoom in. I think it's him. Yeah, they're still inside. Ruth, look. Isn't that your Dutch teacher? Yikes, what a pervert. Really, Liesl? - Really? Her Dutch teacher. Where did you find him? That guy from Ena was also a public figure. Yeah, yeah... How was it? Was it nice? - Bizarre. Hey, guys. Guys. Hey, guys. We're on the fucking front page. Hey, guys. Guys, listen. We made the headlines: Biggest car crash in fifteen years. Twelve cars. Twelve cars. - Is it about yesterday? Fucking hell. - Dendermonde-drama. Biggest car accident in fifleen years... Look at this. - What the fuck. Last weekend a car pile-up took place in the region of Dendermonde. Twelve fucking cars crashed with disastrous results. The deadly victim was the young mother of two children. Deadly victim? The two severely wounded were her two children. A six year old boy and a four year old girl got badly burned. What the fuck. That was us. Look at the picture, that's exactly where we were standing. That's the spot. - Crazy. Fucking headlines. Dad decided to spend our vacation on a highway this year. What's the matter, Ruth? I feel bad for them. For those people? - Yes. Seriously? - Yes, somebody died. And two kids are... What, Ruth? We caused that. - We didn't cause that. We were standing there, right? Yes, we were standing on a bridge, made for people to walk and stand on. Don't be such a cry-baby. That father was responsible for his wife who is dead now and his children. They're looking at us while driving, what the fuck. They're just losers. Liesl, I read you want to become an artist? I make reality-art. I see life as one big reality-show. Everything is fake and full of hypocrisy. I want to challenge that and capture everything like it really is. I want to feel I'm alive... ...and push boundaries every day. Jens said you had the biggest turnover this month. Really? Nice. He says we're making good money. Jens and his statistics... - Yeah. he's such a nerd. He uses his head. - And we give head. Why do we need them, anyway? We do need Jens. - Yes, but the others... Yeah, the others don't do anything. Oh, fuck. Hey, I didn't know we had a date. Oh. - Who wants to sit on my locomotive? Alright. One hundred euros. Look at your face. Dirty girl. You're eighteen? - Otherwise we'd be in school now. We're eighteen, but we have a bit more experience. I'd like to take a ride with you. Aye, blondie? Well? What, are you serious? - Yes. Where? - In the cornfield. Fuck it, I'm gonna do that. You're sure? - Yes. It's your lucky day. Hey, put that camera away. - Shut up. Here it is. - Emergencies, right? Simon. Where is she? - I don't know. What happened? - Something with her head. Thomas, sit down. Listen to me. You've already done enough. We make sure they can't link us with the caravan. You found her with an app? - But where did you find her? In the woods, but we don't know anything. Yes, we're gonna burn down the caravan. We're gonna burn down the fucking caravan. Did Femke's death feel alienated? Like witnessing it through a lens? Yes, and no. It didn't feel like I thought the death of a friend would feel. Everything seemed different than the day before. I could suddenly feel everything more intense. The sounds were different. The sun was shining brighter. I could smell everything better. My hands seemed longer... ...and my head was upside down. The world had turned upside down. I suddenly was aware of everything. Twelve, thirteen, fourteen... ...Jesus. Femke is dead. What do you mean? - She's dead, she's gone. RIP, mort, muerte. Jesus. When? Last Saturday. Saturday? - Yes. Guilty conscience? What happened? Accident. That's all I know. We're going to buy flowers to put on her grave. Some of her customers don't want to chip in. It disgusts me. Greedy bastards. I'd really appreciate it, if you could spare some money. Yes, perhaps... This is very kind of you, thanks. Do you consider these recordings art? - Yes, that's reality-art. I think everything you capture is art. I'll show you an example. Why are you filming all the time? - And who's that? That's my mother. Liesl, would you like some tea? Honey? I asked you a question. And why are you filming all the time? - It's a project. I'm worried. Liesl? - What, why? I've, umm... I've been hearing things. What? Yes. - Why? Ena, that skinny girl? Are you sure you can trust her? - What? They say... ...she's been seen with married men. And you believe that? - Well, yes. Mum, come on. Don't be ridiculous. - It's not about what I believe. And Femke? Crazy stories are being told about how she died. I'll be at home more often, alright? Do you have a problem taking your clothes off? This is the perfect place for it. No one goes here. So... ...just join us, otherwise it'll be awkward. The guys, too? - We've all seen each other naked. Yeah. Usually we would've been naked already. Now? - Yes, of course. I'll show you. Come on, guys. Join me. You too, Sarah. Do you find it difficult? Come on. - You're here to be free, come on. It's not so difficult, is it? What's the problem? Do you need help? Don't behave like a toddler. No. - Take your clothes off. It doesn't feel weird. does it? Do you feel any difference? No. - This is freedom. Don't you feel better? Yes, one with nature. Only your inner self. - Group hug. Come on. It doesn't matter. Come on. Why was your dick hard? Yeah... - Sorry, guys. When I see him... - Simon. Does it work? Does it work? Which song? Ena, Ena, Ena. - Yes, it really works. Loes, another one? - What? Another one? - Yes. Sarah, what is it? I can't do it anymore. Why not? We explained everything, didn't we? Just fuck and ask money. I'm late. Late? How long already? - I don't want to say. And do you know who's it is? - Sarah, let's dance. Come on, this isn't a funeral. - Go with that gilt, man. Oh, Sarah... If it's more than three months... I don't know what to do. - Neither do I. Thomas, I have an idea. I'm gonna get pregnant and after twelve weeks... ...I'll get an abortion. And I'll do that a couple of times. And then I'll put these foetuses in big jars. And in every next jar there will be a bigger foetus. It's an an project. And everyone can participate. You really think you can make money with art? Thomas, fucked up an like that... ...is what people want right now. Liesl, Liesl, you got one. - And if everyone joins in... Go with that guy. I don't care about that, Thomas. Have you ever heard of an? That's too difficult for you to understand, isn't it? An? That's my big problem. My ideas are so brilliant, no one understands them. But they 'will, in time, I think. Yes, Thomas? That's not my problem. I'm busy. I'm not gonna play your games in this shitty weather. Solve it. Call Loesje, I don't know. Please, you're getting me into trouble. Liesl, I always help you when something's wrong. Don't do this now. I quit. What's wrong now? It's no fun anymore. Those guys all want the same. If we don't go bigger... ...smarter, and further, I'm gone. These are the captains of industry. TV-people, important people, CEO's... Especially those politicians. They're really shady. This is worth a lot of money. Why did you print it, what's the plan? You can't trust computers. Back-ups baby. fucking back-ups. Find a back-up for me. Liesl, do you have any regrets? - No. Who cares about my contribution? And the rest? - I don't see them anymore. They're too common. I got my own place. I want to go to the School of Ans. I want to write. and become a DJ. Liesl, that all sounds very ambitious. Yes, and ridiculous. Add that as well. The court. The witness may take the stand. What is your name and first name? Devolder, Thomas. Please take the oath, with your right hand risen. I swear to speak without hate, and without fear. To tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It all started when I was eight years old. We moved from Antwerp to Wachtebeke. Close to the Dutch border. I was a shy kid and didn't have many friends. And then... ...when I started to open up, something happened. Something that changed my life forever. Hey. - Hey. Are you awake? I'm still in bed. Are you wet? No. I'm fucking horny. No way? Yeah. Tum me on. Scream. Moan. Louder. I'm gonna fuck you so hard. Yeah. Who's bitch are you? I'm Thomas's property. I'm his little slut. Was it much? My hand full. To our father. - Cheers. To Martin. Are you gonna join us? To us. Thank you. - Congratulations. That's excellent. Did you hear what your brother did? He bought his first piece of art. - A sketch. Oh yes, a painting's not possible. Borremans, right? Michael Borremans? Excellent artist, well done son. Impressive, right? - Yes. What did it cost, originally? - Originally, 8000 euros. And you paid? - 3500 euros. I thought 4000. You got 500 off? Damn, well done. - We bought it together. Yes, but still. Very well done, son. Can you do that too? In a couple of years? Do you know how much 3500 is? Do you? - Yes. Of course not. You never work. - I don't care about your money. I can't understand you. We taught you how to talk. I don't care about your money. What? You don't care? And who paid for the food on your plate? And the table, and this whole house. I worked my entire life for this. Shame on you. The food is really good. Kiss ass. Remember that cold winter? - Stop it, mum. Come, dear. Icicles were hanging from the roof. - It was amazing. And then, Martin... ...took a ladder to get to the biggest icicle. Remember, Thomas? - I did that especially for you, son. Is your little icicle still in the freezer? Yes. - Yes, we had to keep it. Little Thomas. We still have that icicle. - Really? Bye, Thomas. I kept it. - You did? Drama queen. - He's not a drama queen. Is it okay for him to just walk off? Well, yes... - On my birthday? I'm gonna talk to him. - Don't. Leave him. You even managed to ruin your dad's birthday. Why's that? When will you learn to control yourself? A businessman never loses control. It's bad for business. Hey, get over here, dammit. You have been a real pain in the ass lately. And what about Vanlangendonck? Hey. Why is he asking questions about you? That's an important client of mine. Thomas. The first time mayor Vanlangendonck abused me... ...was at my home... ...in the bedroom... ...after a business party from my dad. Fucking bitch. I swear, you fucking asshole. You never came forward with the abuse? No, I didn't dare to. I had a very good relationship with my parents... ...especially with my father... No, no. Liesbeth, call the police. ...but Vanlangendonck had total power over me. Goddammit. Look at this Chinese. Yeah, I looked the door. - Look, animal fuck. Animal, donkey. Try hardcore anal. Hardcore... - Hardcore anal with shit. That's good. Doesn't your dad notice? No, my brother says it's being paid for from a different account. Not a spectacular website. - This sucks. Try dead people pom. - Go ahead, dead people porn. Do people really watch this? Do you think we can earn money with that? Does it pay a lot? With pom? - Yeah, pom. Yes, a lot. Do you know how to make a website? - That's easy. And you know how to put video's on it? Yes? - Easy. When we were seventeen Vanlangendonck forced us... ...to make porn video's of ourselves and put them online for money. It made him rich, and he wanted more. It's fucking huge. The girls had to prostitute themselves at the clients' homes. Here take this. - Okay. And now? - Ring the doorbell. Okay, ring it. I'm ready. Is this the right address? - Yes, Meijsers. I'm fucking nervous. - Jens, it's gonna be alright, okay? We know what we're supposed to do. Hello? Who is it? - Hello? It's Kim. What do I say? Come, come, come. It's gonna be alright, okay? Do you remember the code word? You remember it? - Yes. You can do it, alright? I believe in you. Ready? There he is. Are we on time? - Yes. Hi, good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thomas. - You are the new tenants? These are the keys. This one is for the garden shed. These are the keys to the backdoor... ...and this one to the front door. Looks good. Okay, you've already seen the house. I'll give you the keys now. Don't make a mess. Yes, thank you. If this is gonna cause me any trouble I'm gonna break your neck, okay? We're just gonna hang out here. - It's alright. Okay. Hey, guys. Fucking huge, man. - Wow. It just needs a bit of cleaning. Oh, it's pretty big. - I'm gonna go see if the shower works. Where is the bathroom? Thomas, where shall I put this? What? - Where shall I put this? I think it's too early. - To early? Hey. Hey Jens, Jens, Jens. Ena looks much younger. Tight pussy, you know? We can charge more for that. The gifls get jealous if we charge different prices. Jens, don't worry. It's gonna be fine. Supply and demand. Where did all the money go? Vanlangendonck kept all of it. He only gave us a small percentage. But it was never enough for him. He made us blackmail the rich customers. Are you looking for something specific? - Yeah, uh... Something like that. - It's 3.195 euros, this one. Oh, I want this one. It's pretty pricey. - Yes, it's a Vespa. You can borrow my girlfriend for half an hour. I don't do that. She seems to like the scooter. What about a group rate? We'll take four for 6.000 euros. That's a good deal. - We're not gonna do that. Why not? - Come on. Have you got fire insurance? I'll get a brick, some gasoline and a lighter. So, we'll take four scooters for 6.000 euros. That seems... - Bugger off. Hey, hey, hey. - Bugger off. I ask for a group rate. I offer sex... I was afraid this would happen. - Piss off. Hello? Shit, it's all over your trousers. That's okay, I brought a handkerchief. She's under age. Sixteen years old. That's okay, I brought a handkerchief. So, it's a deal. What colour do you want? Thomas and Karl are here. - Finally. Finally. You're up to something. What? No. - Yes, you are. Look at your fem, come on. No? - Yes, you are. You should see your fem. Tell us. - Come on. Remember that guessing game we used to play? Ya. - With Ena? You'll never gum this one. - You brought something? Femke - It's gonna be sensational. Femke, you're on. Okay, bend over. - We're in the twenty centimetre category. So that's about... ...half of my penis. so that should be fine. - That should work. You mean double your penis. If you can guess this one, you're the best. That's sick. If you guess this one... Ruth, let the master play his game. This is gonna be hilarious. Okay, I think I can handle it. Are you ready? - Yes. This one is really insane. Femke, don't be a drama queen. - Wait. Don't touch her. Is she still breathing? - She's exaggerating. I don't know. Maybe her neck is broken. - Don't do anything stupid. Stop it. Call an ambulance. Tell me about the day you found her. I was at home. We found Femke... ...with a tracking-app on her phone. Later I heard Femke had made an appointment at our clubhouse. They must have gotten into a fight. Vanlangendonck beat her to death. He just left her there, erased all his tracks... ...and burned down our caravan. We took her to the hospital. But we were too late. She died. After Femke's death I had a terrible time. What could we do against a politician? We didn't have any proof and his friends were everywhere. He denied everything. It was around the same time... ...we encountered that student. Who suddenly started hitting us. Hey, cut it out. The police report states a different story. In the hospital, the student stated you were the one... ...who suddenly started to hit him. That's impossible. That's not how I remember it, but it was a crazy and confusing time. May I remind you, you are under oath, Mr. Devolder? No, really what that student is saying, can't be true. I've never been in a fight in my whole life. He's out. He's out. Thomas, leave it. Hey, fuck you, man. - Calm down. Dude, that chick's all yours. - What? She's all yours. I already gave her so much booze I can hardly believe she's still standing. Loes... Kari, I've got a plan. - What is it? Loes, do you want another one? - What? Another one? - Yeah. Vanlangendonck couldn't get enough of it. He demanded a replacement for Femke. And we found them at the fairground. Loesje and Sarah. Do you really wanna do it? Simon, don't be such a baby, we already agreed to it. Where. WHORRREEEE Yeah, yeah. - Don't act all smart. Quiet. The girts had to be subjected and initiated. It was horrible. I felt so bad for them. As a mayor, I can say, family life... ...is the keystone to our community. I love spending time with my wife and daughter. They are my identity. Loesje, you smell. Where am I? - You're with Thomas. Do you want water? Some water? - Yes. Vanlangendonck wanted everything to be extreme. They threw perverted parties... ...with a lot of dancing, snorting and fucking. The girls were quuored up... ...and got fucked by three men at once. They even carved 'whore' on her cunt. Mr. Devolder, there is a jury present. I'm not a whore. I don't remember anything. I don't remember anything. - I don't care what they carved in you. I will not leave you, okay? Look at me. I'm gonna take care of you. I promise. I swear. Really. From now on I'm gonna take care of you. And the next morning he would sit... ...next to them and comfort them so he would look like a hero. They were at my door again. - The cops? That's not gonna stop, Thomas. Our stories don't match up. - Goddammit. There's the son of a bitch. What, who? - Vanlangendonck. I've got the fucking solution, Karl. I've got the fucking solution. What? Yes? - Yo, Jens. Who were Femke's customers the day she died? What? What do you mean? - Was Vanlangendonck one of her customers? Ya, yes. Why, what's wrong? Send a video of Femke and Vanlangendonck to our aspirant mayor. What? Thomas, are you sure? Jens, listen to me. Send it from my e-mail address. Okay? - Okay. What are you doing? - Karl... ...focus. Vanlangendonck fucked Femke the day it happened. Yes. His DNA is all over her. What's wrong, daddy? - Nothing. Vanlangendonck began to send us threatening e-mails. I lost control over the group. I couldn't take it anymore. We all know who's gonna win. The score is... Thomas: 1-0. Thomas the boss. Thomas, we got to talk. We got a problem. Just fix it, we got the money. Just send something to him. Those were the worst days of my life. I couldn't sleep at night. And Ruth, Ruth couldn't take it anymore. She got a burnout. Liesl freaked out and got rebellious. Kari and Jens started to ask questions. And Simon... Simon disappeared all of a sudden. Thomas? I'm at the apartment, will you come and get me, please? No. It's freezing. No, I did it in the car. I don't have any keys. How Vanlangendonck abused me as a boy... ...started to haunt me. I couldn't hold it in any longer. I confronted him and he freaked out. I collapsed after that. Why can't you find them? Why can I find them? These keys? Look, look. Look at me. Look at me. Look at my face. Is this what you want? Fucking cunt. One hundred euros per customer. One hundred. And you show up with twenty? Hey, are you cold? Are you cold? Take off your clothes. Take them off. Take off your clothes. I'm never gonna forget the keys again. And I'll never... ...charge too little. And I'm... Loesje, are you cold? A nice, warm shower. A warm shower. That's what you deserve. Fucking cunt. - Stop it, stop it. Why are we stopping? - I'm gonna tie the dog to the track. What? - We tie the dog to the track, that's funny. Come on, it's funny. Come on, Liesl, Ena. HEY- Dude, leave the dog alone. - What the fuck. Jens. You're a fucking pussy. Are you gonna run home to mummy? Thomas, are you insane? - Liasl, don't start talking about 'insane'. Who is the most insane? This is fucking art. Reality-art. You lost your mind. Oh my god. - Ena, go blow someone. The train is coming. Untie the dog, so we can leave. That's the whole point. Ha-ha, funny. This is Vanlangendonck's new look. What does that dog have to do with him? What are you doing? - I'm calling the cops. Your Honour... ...together we decided to turn Vanlangendonck in. Despite the consequences for us. At first my dad didn't want to believe me. His best client... ...his political idol... ...but we had a lot of evidence, videos, pictures... ...threatening e-mails... Your Honour... ...this was not for ourselves... It was all for Femke. And I'm not proud, that we waited this long. And maybe, I could've, maybe I could've saved Femke. I didn't have the courage to disclose his sexual abuse. And he threatened to ruin my father. I didn't know what to do. He dragged us all into it. But I did learn one thing, your honour. You can stay on the train... ...I'll jump off... ...or lay down in front of it... ...but sometimes... ...you've got to pull the emergency brake. Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Devolder. The outcome of the trial of the Vanlangendonck scandal is expected soon. A large police investigation after Femke Klaassen's death... ...revealed matters such as sexual abuse, and sex parties with minors... ...by a network of dignitaries. Afier the emotional testimonies of Femke Klaassen's seven friends... ...and the DNA traces... ...it is expected the jury will follow the demands of the Prosecution. Simon... - Wow, nice car. No, no, no. You should drive. No one has a car like this one. BMW, nice, right? You look well. How are you? - I'm okay. Got a new school. New girlfriend. Chill. - What a car. But, how are you? Do you still see the others? No, no, no... ...they're too busy. You know the drill. But... I'm doing good, I bought an apartment in Paris. In Paris? - Yeah. way more opportunities, Simon. Hey, Vanlangendonck got nailed. - Yeah. yeah. That they fell for your abuse story... Brilliant. That was all bullshit, right? Thomas?
