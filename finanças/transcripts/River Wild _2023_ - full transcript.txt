- I thought you were coming back Sunday. - No, Tuesday. - Oh. Okay. Well, I'm glad you're finally doing this. - It'll be fun. Nice change of pace. - For sure. - Yeah. - And we can just- We'll look at houses next week. Jo? - Yeah. - Anyway, I hope your brother's doing good. And remember, if you hear a banjo playing, run. Have a great time. Call me when you're back on the grid, okay? - Okay, yeah, thank you. - Be safe. - All right, bye. - Bye. - If I'm floating in the water, keep my feet downstream, gently bend my knees. You'll be floating on your back. Head tucked, knees gently bent. - Kiss your ass goodbye. - Oh, hey. She made it. Hi, kid. - Sorry I'm late. - Yeah, that's all right. We almost left without you. - I would've chased you down. - I bet you would've. - Yeah. You look good. - Thank you, I feel good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, this is my kid, sis, Joey. This is Karissa and Van. They're actually paying to be here, unlike some free loaders. - I tried to pay. - She didn't try that hard. - So what, are we crashing a family holiday? - No, no, no, no, not at all. If anything, she's crashing my place of work. - So I bet Trevor's like your brother or something, then is he? - Well, basically, yeah. - Trevor? - Yeah, yeah. A little surprise. He was supposed to be off today, but heard you were coming and wanted to join the trip. So, if you could just get his head out of his ass. - Just like old times, then. - Yeah, just like Snake River. You need help with your gear? - No. - All right. - Boat's down there. - I'll be right back. Okay. - Great. Chop chop, 'cause... Thank you. Let's get you girls sized up. - Holy shit. Not on my river. - Hey. - Hey! - Holy shit, good to see you. - You, too. - Holy shit, been a minute. - Yeah. Yeah, it's been forever. - Yeah. How you been? - Yeah, good. Really good. - Yeah? - Yeah. I hear great things. - Yeah. - I hear good, good things. Let me ask you a question. How many lives you saved this week? Come on. - Yeah, I mean, I don't know, two or three. - Two or three! Just two or three. No big deal. Holy shit. Gray told me you're coming. It was supposed to be my weekend off and I said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll be on the boat with Jo Bean. We got a lot to catch up on. - Yeah. Thank you very much. How have you been? - Me? - Yeah. - Pretty good. Pretty good, yeah. You know, not in prison anymore. - I did notice. - You noticed? - Yeah. - Great. - When'd that happened? - Yeah, a little after Christmas. And um, yeah, pretty good, you know? Gray hooked me up with the job. I'm loving this. On the river every day. Getting paid to paddle. It's pretty great. - I remember how. - Except you never did it right in the first place. - This isn't right? - No, your fold's up. - I'm a triple folder, bro. - If the fold's up, it's gonna leak. Let me- - If the fold is up- - Can I just show you how? - Aw, there it is, it's clicked. - I hope everything gets wet. - Hey, Gray? - You can freeze for two nights. - Can I show you this for a second? - Is he still texting you? - No, he's just asking- - Give it to me. - No, it's fine. - It's going in the river. No, it's going in the river. - It's not fair! - Jo Bean, you gotta sign the safety waiver. - Do I? Oh, what is this? Arbitration. - Give it to me! - Get off me. - You are being- Oh, my God. - Can you please hurry up and sign it so I can murder you without getting in trouble? - Well, now you can finally get rid of me. - Geez. Gimme that, gee. Girls, hey, girls, girls! We should load up. We're burning daylight. - Okay. - It's time to float. - Well, I did when I was in Austria with my dad. - And she doesn't know a classic city in America. - Boise's the state capital. It's about nine hours south of here. - Oh, cool. - Where are you all from? - We both live in London. - Yeah, but I'm from Dublin. - Oh. That's Lucky Charms, right? - What? - That's the Lucky Charms capital. - Doesn't make no sense. I don't know what you're talking about. - It doesn't make any sense? You're from Dublin, you don't know Lucky Charms? - I'm sorry, should I know a lucky charms? - She's never heard that joke before. - Trevor, you're better than this. - It's the first time! - You mean the leprechaun? - Yeah! - Oh, my God the leprechaun? - Okay, see, she knows the leprechaun. - Forgive Trevor. He's lived a very sheltered life. - I grew up in a grocery store. - Is this your first time in the States? - No, actually, Van and I, we stopped through Puerto Rico once. - Yeah. - And I went to New York with my husband. - And I think that was the last time he let you out of the house. - Oh, come on. - They're our friends now, we can vent! - It's not worth the oxygen is that conversation. - You know I had to jail break her ass? - Oh, stop it. - Yes, I did! I had to drag you out by your hair, bitch. - Does he know you're gone? Did you leave pillows under the blanket? Did you Ferris Bueller his ass? - Trevor and I Ferris Buellered our way through high school. - Oh. I hear Ogden pass. - Mhm. - What's Ogden pass? - That is our first rapids. - Only a class two, though. - No, not after yesterday's rain. - Oh my God, man. Ogden never surges. - I'm telling you, storm broke those banks. Trust me. - Trust me. I'll bet you dinner at Lupe's. - Dinner at Lupe's? - Yeah. Storm didn't break shit. - Oh, Mr .Deep Pockets. You got yourself a deal. - I got myself a meal. - Here we go! Left side, left side! - Come on, Jo Bean! Paying customers are doing all the work. - Oh my God! - You good? - Oh my God, no! - Look at her go! Here comes the big one! - Here we go! Swimmer! - Oh my god, it's so much colder! - Want some? - No, I'm good, thank you. - You all right? - Yeah, yeah. - What's not to be all right about? You know? - You both don't have to do it, we can climb back down. - Sorry about that dip you took. - Do you guys wanna go first? - No, no way, I just got dry. - Trevor? - No thanks. - Because he's afraid of heights. - Bull shit! - True shit. His whole life. Joey, our tree house. Did Trevor ever come up? Or did he stay on the ground scared because he had to- What did you have to do? - I was securing the perimeter. You were scared of dogs. - Well, you stay there and secure the perimeter as an adult man who's not afraid of heights. - Let me go up there and secure your asshole. - God, here he comes. Now we gotta jump, okay? 3, 2, 1! - Get back up here! I'm not afraid to swim. - I mean, also just use your brain. - Nope. - Yeah, we'll take help. - I'm just gonna start- - Okay. - Poking this in here. See what that does for you. That, you want this tension. It's good. - Yeah, so you go that way and then- - You gotta start over. - For this? For this, you called and said, I wanna come visit you? To play a little bitch game? - Yeah. I missed a little bitch game. - Well, you just nominated yourself as fire starter. - There we go, in no time. All right, who wants to do the cherry on top? - Me. - Tie a little bow. Let me help you. Pull on the hole. It's an important job. It's the best part. - Hey, where is the best place for me to- I mean, where should I- - She has to take a piss. Well, you do. - Come on. - Anywhere you like. Pick your favorite tree and cop a lean. - Okay. Are there animals around? - Yeah, there's certainly animals out here. - Okay. - Lots, but they're not gonna bug you. Here, if it makes you feel better. - You want this? - No, thank you. Looks great, though. - Sharp. - Yeah. - All right. - Looks dangerous. - This is bear mace. You won't need it, but that's the safety, squeeze it on top. Make sure you don't point it at your face. - Uh, terrifying. Thank you. - Yeah, you got it. - Okay. - Holler if you need anything. - I probably will scream. - I can feel you looking at me. - "Holler if you need anything." What's going on with that bulge? I see it. - Shut up, man. - Oh, Gray. - Use your bulge. - Give me that tea, Gray. - Use your bulge. - Give me that tea. - Hey, um, do you guys want some or, I mean, is it okay that I brought this? - No. - No? - You're in trouble. - I'm in trouble? - Come on down here to the fire. We have to have a team meeting about this. - Oh, okay. If I have to. - What are we gonna do? - Okay, so it's like four o'clock in the morning I think, and we've been out since like eight, okay. And Care bear goes up to her and she goes, "I'll give you five American dollars for a-" - I'm sorry, is that supposed to be me? - That sounds exactly like you. That's how she sounds. And she's drunk as well, so keep that in mind. And she goes, and this girl goes, "American Dollar? What you mean American Dollar?" And you should have seen- - Hold up, I don't get it. Why'd she, why was the American dollar thing? Why was that funny? - They're in America! - I was so drunk and I maybe forgot that they use American dollars in Puerto Rico. - They use American dollars in Puerto Rico. - So wait, did you get your cigarette? - No. Shift the conversation, please. Joey, do you wanna tell us about yourself? Tell us something about you. - Uh... What do you wanna- what do you wanna know? - Are you married, are you married? - Whoa. No. I don't know why that's funny, but- - Boyfriend? - Yeah, sorta. I don't know. - I don't know. What's that mean? Be honest. - I don't know. I mean, he's... He's nice. He's a nice guy. - How did you meet him? - We work together. - Mm, doctor. - Oh, sexy doctor. - Is he a sexy doctor? - I guess he's like- He's all right. He's like, you know, tall and- He's like stupid tall, actually. - Stupid tall, McStupid Tall. - Wow, he sounds awful. - Yeah, it's tall doctor. Probably wants a family. Piece of shit. Guy's like a monster. - Oh, hey, Gray. You sure you didn't want any? - No, thank you. - Oh, come on. You're off the clock. And besides, we're all the best friends now, right? - A river guide is never off the clock. - Okay, come on. When people don't drink, that's actually when I get suspicious. - You don't need to worry about me. It's this idiot you should be suspicious of. - Wait, no, no, okay. So like, look, we can toast, right? One toast to our first day of not drowning. I didn't drown. - You know what? You do a toast for me. - Oh, please, just one. - You do a toast for me. - Come on. - Please, just one toast. - All very good points, but- - He's sober. - Well, that's amazing. Good for you. - It's nothing, you know. - On that note, I'm gonna hit the hay. It's been fun. Thank you for a great day. And I'll see everyone in the- I'm racked. I've been up for almost 24 hours. But thank you very much, it's been a great day. Enjoy your night. I'll see you in the morning. - We'll miss you. - Good night, Joey. - Fill her up. Fill her up. - Very cool. - Thank you. That's what these are really for. You don't need to be getting up. - Yeah, hey Karissa. - Yeah? - Yeah, the wind's pushing the smoke like right in your direction. You might be better off if you move to the side. - That's a good idea. - Karissa, he wants you to come all the way over to where it's nice and safe by him. Just right next to him. Give him a sloppy wet kiss. - Oh my God. - Just give him a kiss. - On behalf of Kootenai River Adventures, I would like to apologize for any inappropriate and offensive comments made. - They're buying it. They're buying it, you're good. You're covered. - Okay, well I gotta go visit a tree. - Oh, okay, be careful. You should go that way. - This way? - Yeah. I went over there and I nearly died. There's a full on cliff, seriously. - Right, okay. - She should have taken the bear mace. - I think I'm gonna do the same thing. You should just- Get outta the smoke. - I think Trevor- - Yeah, yeah. It sort of followed you, didn't it? It's like drawn to you. - You're so right. Save me from Trevor's curse. I think he cursed me. Oh, okay. It's nice down here. - Mhm. - Oh, I mean, work. - I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I worked for Kootenai probably a little over three years, now. But it's not work. Just, it's what I love. - But you take it really seriously, I can see that. - Well, yeah. You have to, you know. And you, what's your thing? - Well, I was really into fashion. - Ah. That's cool. That's cool. - Yeah, I studied at uni and I loved it. And I just, I wanted to, you know, go. I wanted to go to New York. I wanted to design. But then I got married and he doesn't want me to work. - That's a bummer. I dunno. I'd go insane without work. I'm serious. This job saved my life. They took me in, you know. Let's just say I didn't have the best support system. - Yeah, I get that. - Yeah. - Gray! Guys, we need help here! - What was that? - Shit. Trev, everything okay? - Hurry! - Gray? - Trev, where are you? - Guys? - Wait, where's van? Van? - Hey! - Over here. - Van! - Van, where are you? - Over here. - What happened? - Yeah, she fell. - What happened, what happened? - Don't get up, don't get up, don't get up. Just chill, just hang on. Hang on, just stay there. - Don't touch me. Don't- - okay, all right. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Can you help me get up? - Don't move. We need you to lay down. - I'm fine. - Okay? - I'm fine. - I'm gonna get you down on the ground and lay you down flat, okay? - I just wanna get up. - What happened? - She tripped. - It doesn't even hurt. - Okay, no, that's okay. That's good. We're just gonna help you, okay? - Big ass rock right here that she hit her head on. - No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. - It doesn't even hurt, okay. - Hey Trev, why don't you go get the first aid kit, yeah? It's in my bag. - Let me check your eyes. - Actually, grab the sat phone, call ranger six. - We don't need to call anyone. - Go get some big sticks so that I can stabilize her neck. Go, go. Okay, look at me. Grab my hands. - I doesn't even hurt, okay. - I want you to keep your eyes open, okay? Take deep breaths. - I feel like I'm fine. Honestly, we don't need- - I want you to wiggle your fingers. Okay, can you lift your feet up? - Yeah. - Any numbness, tingling? - He grabbed me. He grabbed me. Don't let him come back, please. - It's okay. Just stay with us. - First aid kit. - How hard did she fall? - I don't know, not that hard. - Get up. - Big ass rock. - Any of these work? - I'm gonna put some pressure- - Sat phone's dead, man. - What? - Yeah, yeah. - It doesn't even hurt. - Did you swap bricks? - Yes, always. - They're both dead. - Dude, they never work. - We need to get her to the hospital. - Wait, she's fine, right? - I don't need to go to the hospital, okay. I feel like I'm fine. - How far is the road? - There's no road out here. Ranger station six is closest to help. - How far? - It's like half a day hike. But the river cuts straight through. - How long? How long? - With a fast current, two hours. - In the dark? - I don't think we have a choice. - Listen, we might not have two hours. She's got a skull fracture. It's gonna start to swell. - You're fine, you're fine, you're fine. - Please, you're my friend. Please just help me. They're freaking me out. - Is that the fastest way? Gray! - By far. - Okay, go. Start packing up. Essentials only. Go, move. - Keep her straight. - Careful, careful. First this way. - Keep it even. Keep it even, guys. We're almost there. - You got her? You got her. Not too fast. - Keep her straight. - Slow, slow. - Alright, count of three. 1, 2, 3, down. There you go, easy, easy. Okay. All right, there you go. You're okay. All right. - Hey! - Hello? - Hello! Anybody out there? - We need help! - Anybody hear us? - Anybody? - We had the only campsite in this canyon. No one's out here. - Doesn't work, man. - I'm just looking. - It didn't charge. - You were supposed to charge it. - I did charge it. - Well, obviously not. - Bro, those kits don't hold their juice. I told management about it like 10 times. - Will you guys just shut up and man the boat? - Cara? Cara? - Yeah, hey. Hey, I'm right here. Talk to me. - This is- This is just like at uni, remember? When I dislocated my shoulder? - Yeah. Well I told you not to get on that board, didn't I? - Oh, can't back down from a dare. - That's true. - Besides, I knew you'd take care of me. - Yeah, well, I always take care of you, don't I? - And it was worth it for those cheese toasties. - Well, okay. I promise you, we're gonna get you home and I am gonna make you all the cheese toasties that you can eat, okay? We'll just get you home. We'll just get you home. - Wait, are you burning? - What? - Smells like... Smells like they're burning. - Okay, okay, okay, Trevor, hold her feet. - Oh my God, what's happening? Oh my God. - She's having a seizure. Help us. Okay, we're gonna turn her on her side, okay? - Is she dying? - No, no, no. - Van? Van? - Gently now, hold her head. - Uh-huh. - 1, 2, 3. - Oh my god. - That's good. That's good. Okay, okay. That's a good girl. Good, good. How much further? - An hour. I mean, maybe less, but we got some big water coming. - Okay. - Just half a mile to the Lone Pine bend. - Okay, we gotta pack her in. - In case you go overboard, we'll be able to see you. Karissa. And Joey. Okay, here it comes. On my call. Left and right. Listen for my voice. Left! Left! Now right! Right! Go together. Now left, left! Right! - Karissa! T-Grade! - Yep, I got it, I got it. - Leave us some more room on the haystack. - I got it! - Row, row, row! Okay, guys, brace! - I got it, I got it. - All right, get ready to dig. - I can't see shit! - Trevor, help me out. Hard on the left. Trevor. Left, Trevor! - Grab on to something! Joey! - Gray! - Where's Van? - I don't know! Karissa! Karissa! - Van! No, no, no, no, no! Van! I got you, I got you, I got you. - Oh, God. Gray! - Joey? Joey, over here. - I'm coming! - I've got Van! I don't think she's breathing. I can't tell, I can't tell. Where's Karissa? - I don't know, I lost her. - Okay, I gotta find- Have you seen Trevor? - I got you. - Trevor! Trevor! - Come on, girl. - Karissa! Trevor! - Over here! Help me! - I got you. - You got eyes on Karissa? I haven't seen her. - Van!

Huddle, huddle. - Is Van breathing? - Get close together. - Is she breathing? - Yes! - Are you okay? - Need to get warm. - I'm gonna get- - Wait! I need to talk to you. - I think he did that on purpose. Flipped us, flipped the boat. - What? - He doesn't want us to get help. - Joey, we don't have time for this. - Listen to me. He attacked her. She told me what happened. - He wouldn't do that. - He doesn't want her to tell anyone. - What and then just let her die? - Yes, to save his own ass. - No, listen. - Yes. - Everyone okay? - Yes. - Yeah, yeah, we're good. - Yeah. - You got the gear, okay. - Yeah, it's down there. - We still got 40 minutes to the ranger station. I'm gonna prep the boat. - Okay, I'm gonna check you, okay? Take some deep breaths in and out. Okay, relax your body. Relax your body. Okay. You're gonna be okay. Okay? - Walt's probably not even there yet. - Well, you can break in and use the landline. - How long? - Ranger says she's just at the top of this hill. We can have a medevac here in 15 minutes. - Hurry. - Hey, hey, hold up, hold up. - You alright? - Hold up, yeah. What was she saying back there? - Who? - Joey. You guys were arguing. - Oh, that was nothing. You know how she gets. - Okay, okay, hey, hey. You got me though, right? 'Cause you know there's gonna be questions. - Dude. - I'm a felon. I'm a felon. You see how people look at me? - That's all in your head. - Right, okay. Is it? I don't think it is. - Trevor, you didn't do anything wrong. - Yeah, no shit I didn't do anything wrong. Tell me, you got me. - I got you, yeah? - I'm not going back. - I'm not gonna let that happen. - I'm on probation. - I know that, all right? It's okay, calm down. - I did three years for you. Three years, you tell me that you got me! Tell me! - I got you. I got you, all right? I got you! Come here, man, come here, I got you. I got you, okay? I got you. - Okay. - You got me? - I got you. - I got you, all right? - Okay. - We gotta go. - How's she doing? - She's breathing.

We got a head wound, it's bad. - Where at? - Down by the shore, we're gonna need a chopper. - Oh, Christ. - She slipped and hit her head on some rocks. The sat phone died on us. It's been a couple hours, man. We need someone fast. - Okay, just wait a second, wait a second. - What? - We don't need all that. It's not that- - It is that bad. - No, no. - It's very bad. - No, we should put her in Walt's truck. It's probably faster. - What are you talking about? - How about we call it in, okay? Let them tell us what's faster. - Exactly. - Wait, wait. - Hear us out, look. We're already in some shit over last week's cabrewers with management, so... just we would like to not report it. - Look, of this is a medical emergency. No, we've gotta call it... Doesn't matter if... - There's a doctor... - Just give me the radio. - Trevor, it's gonna be fine. - You don't know that! - Just give me the god damn radio! - Whoa! - Come on, dude. - All right, guys, guys, guys. - Sorry. - Walt, he's cool alright. - We're done.

Look, he's not even moving anymore. - Come on Wal, Walt. Come on Walt. No. No. - Okay. We still gotta call at least for a van. - No! No one's calling anyone! - I have a plan. You still got me right? - What are you doing? - They should have been back by now. - They're coming. - New plan. We can get back in the boat and head north. - Wait, what are you talking about? - There's a tributary we'll split off on. It's a shortcut to Canada. There's no border patrol. - Where's the ranger? - He's dead. No stop until we get to Canada. - Gray... don't let him do this. So we're hostages now. - Just get me to Canada. You're all free to go. - She won't make it. She will die if we get back on the water. And you're okay with that? You're okay letting her die? - No! I'm not okay with it. Get in the boat. Let's go come on. - Let's go. - Hey there. You guys all right? - Hey, yeah. You? - You guys need some help? - No. She just had a little fall. She's good. And she's a doctor, so she's in good hands. Where you headed? - I'm just up here. Just few miles up past Horseshoe. There's a really nice camping spot out there. - Oh yeah sure. Gorgeous. - Have you been there? - Yeah, but I've been meaning to get back. Listen, if you guys need me to go get help I can. - No, no. It's okay. We got our car at the next takeout. - Got it. Hope your friend feels better. - Yeah, man. Thanks. Have a good one. - Yep. - God damn it he knows. We gotta find a way up there. - To do what? - I don't know. Talk to him. I don't know. - He doesn't know anything. - Unless he's blind. He can clearly see there's a dead girl on the raft. - Trev. - He's going for help right now 100%. - I promise you he's not. - You promise me? 'Cause you know everything, right? Why you gonna say your serenity prayer? Huh? God Gimme this strength. Go gimme this drink. Okay. Hey. Gray. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. Okay, let's push through the night. - No, no. - He's going for help right now. And he's going to find somebody and they're going to catch up. - No, we can't do it. Okay. We cannot do it. We will not survive. I'm drawing the line. Lone pine is one thing, but in broad daylight, you can't. I won't allow it. - Who's got the gun here, brother. - You do big man. So pull the trigger. 'Cause if you make us go over the beast at night, you're killing us anyway. We can't do it. Okay. We can't do it. If you want to get to Canada if you want to get through this, we need to work together. Even if he's going to get help right now we're splitting off in two miles of boundary run. No one goes that way unless they're doing the beast. - Okay, let's split off everyone paddle. Pick up a paddle everyone go. - All right. I think we're deep enough in. These girls can't paddle much more. - Okay find an easy takeout. Somewhere with soft soil so we can bury her. - Bury her? I can't just - We have to. There's too much weight for the last lake tomorrow. - How much further - Until no one can find us. - Be an awful quiet up there, brother. You thinking about how to get this gun? So I'm a bad guy now. Yeah. After all I did for you. She doesn't even know, does she? Do you? You know about this guy's side hustle? Not mine. Mind you his. - Trev! - What? You were good at it. Hey, hold up. This guy was slinging more rock than anyone in East Boise. He had a real good run. Keep walking. Go. - This Dayton got her pregnant? I couldn't let him do time for distribution. Not when he had something good. I didn't have anything. But this life was turning into something. I couldn't let that get all messed up. I was home when the cops busted in. - I didn't ask you to. - You didn't have to. I knew what to do because we're brothers. I cracked. The only family I ever had man. You too Joey Bean. You look a little sister to me. Let's go. Sorry does that hurt? The cold? Look... I promise, we're gonna make it. Everyone just stressed up we got a big day. Remember that song we used to sing in our tents off Snake River. - You promised. She said you weren't involved. - I was so out of my mind back then. Didn't even know what I was doing. - Probably whatever he wanted you to. - God, you're still his bitch. No? - No. - Then do something. I'm tied up too. - You had chances. - You'll have more. - He has a gun. Do you really think I'm okay with any of this? - It's between me and him. It'll always be him. - That's not true. - The summer. The summer you rented the cabin. You... You let him... use me. Like a toy, like a gift. - No, what? You liked him. You... - I was 15. You were my brother. Wait, wait, wait. Thank you. - I knew something wasn't right. - Guys. - I've been following you guys since the bridge. - Did you call for help? - I don't have a sat. Nearest visit is as soon as a day's hike from here. It was getting dark, so I thought I-- - Stupid piece of shit! - Fucking you! - You hero. - Did you do that? Did you call for help? - No Trevor, she didn't. He just showed up. He was just a hiker and showed up. It's over. No, no. Trevor, don't do this. Trevor! Listen to me. The beast. You need us. You're not doing the beast alone. You can't, right? You need us. You need hostages in case goes sideways. Right? I'm still in this with you. Please, please don't. - Fucking please don't. It's okay. - I know. - It's all right. - I know. Yeah. - Gotta bury another body. - I know. I know, man. - You flip us, they drown. So. - We gotta untie them. - Can't. - We're gonna flip. Last time I did the Beast with four pros we ate shit. One got a concussion. - You know he lived. - Barely, all right. It was stupid luck. We caught the right current. If you don't get to the shore after the third drop you go straight over the falls. Instant death, lights out! - Hey, hey! You're Gray Reese, you've known this river. Come on now! - Trevor, please, I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Let them go. You have to let them go, okay? Don't make this worse. If anything, it'll lighten the boat. You and I working together, we have a better shot anyway! - I need hostages. Like you said. - Trevor, it's Joey. I'm begging you. Let them go. - Just do your best. - Whatever happens, I hope you die first. - Are we leaking? Did you do that? Did you?! Are you lying to me? - No. - Don't you lie to me. Find a takeout.
