Kiss me or I'll not let you go. Daddy! Here is my little darling. Good morning, little lady. Aleksi! Yes, sir! Who has taught you this song? I've heard the choristers learn it. Come on, start it again. What a beauty has come to see me. I've stored something for you. Nuga? No. Hush, no one's to hear. Speak up! The delicious thing is in the trunk. Granny, I love you so much! Is it Jesus' book? Yes, honey. The angel is waiting for you. Ring the bell. The ducks turned yellow. Here're binoculars. And here're our swans. Father, mother and me. - Look at the seed. It's alive. We'll now plant it and it'll fall asleep. Then we'll give it some water. The seed'll swell and sprout a stem with an ear. There'll be many small beds in the ear. New seeds'll go to sleep there. Got it? Yes, but I won't sleep now. Dear God! Bless me and save from evil. Teach me good and show me the path of truth to bring peace and happiness to my mom, dad, grandpa and motherland... That's a good boy! Come here. We'll learn two letters today. When you learn your ABC, the magic world of books will open up before you and bring you lot of joy.

I'm leaving. My mother was here now. - She was four years old when she was stolen by some tramps, we could not find and sign of he. Her name is Keto. They say she's been taken and sold. A noble man has bought her. This is comforting. I'll ask everybody, look everywhere for her. If I have some news, I'll send for you, or I'll come myself. Take care of it. Nino, what are doing? Where are you going? Don't you hear me, what are you doing? - What are you doing? Your child is stolen from your own yard, you have disgraced yourself. Don't stop me, It up to you until now... You should have walked all over again and again looking for her. Oh, I miss her so much... Is it my fault? Dry grass... Nino, today is our wedding day. The witch! "Salam" Christ, our Lord, grant peace to the world, stop all wars, give fish to those fishing, give fruit to the country, release evil spirits, heal blind, raise destroyed... Take care of widows and orphans. Keto! Keto! Keto! She's forgotten us. She doesn't remember Georgian. She was brought up far away from home. Keto, here are all your toys, do you remember? You loved to play with them. Your little donkey. Remember your rabbit? Rabbit, rabbit, little rabbit. Here is your turtle, you never slept without it... I used to sing Lullaby to you. You were sitting chick to chick with me. Keto, don't you see me? Keto, tell Mu-mmy. I'm your mother, Keto, your mother! Keto, tell mo-ther, mo-ther! Keto, my Keto! Nino! Don't worry. Everything will be all right. Very soon. Don't cry. Look at these beads, you enjoyed playing with them. This is your dress. It looks so nice on you. You are so beautiful, Keto. I'm your mother, you are Keto. I can not watch sufferings of this child. If in some days she'll not turn to us, I'll take her back. Where? They should be nice people. Better to have her dead but here with me... Nino My, my, even dead... here with me. What are you speaking Nino, calm down! Keto, you loved this spring once, remember? We often were sitting here and listening to it's murmuring... It was telling us stories about clouds, stones and many other things... Keto, Keto, tell mo-ther. Never mind. Time will pass and you'll remember everything. Come along. I'll show you something. You always loved to run here around... It was always your favorite place. Do you remember Aleksi? You were playing always together. Look, this is Aleksi's mother. Keto! Keto! Forgive me. Don't look there, to that direction, from where the terrible black men came and stole you from me. Do you hear me? You are my daughter. Come on, here on these stairs you were sitting and playing, and they came and took you from this very place. Don't scare the child, madam. Take her to church, she'll remember everything. - They cannot go to our churches, their religion prohibits them. Why them? This is my child, Keto. Where are our hosts? Show us Keto... We've come to see her. My God! What have they done Nutsa, help me! What we have done to our poor baby! It's over, take her back immediately. Keto doesn't belong to us. Forgive me. You are right. I'm going. You'll go soon, back to your "parents", to your home. I'll be always with you... looking from above on you, sleep, now... Mother! I love you, mom.
