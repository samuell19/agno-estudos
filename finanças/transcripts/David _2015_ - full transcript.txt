I'm gonna kill you, David! Stop making those noises! I've had enough! I'm telling you, we're gonna put you in the asylum. You'll pack your stuff and you'll be off! Why are you here in the dark? Well? You don't know what to say? Dunno. Grab the chair, please, will you? -Have you washed your hands? -I have. Have you, really? Let me see. You have. It's a disgrace how you just need to keep controlling him all the time. David, can you arrange the cutlery, please? -Can I help you with anything? -No, thanks. We have four cranes here. The investor wants the construction done by the end of September. The crane operators get no breaks. One break is 15 minutes, which is how long it takes the crane operator to get down and up again. They pretty much work nonstop. The office complex is supposed to have nine storeys, building one storey takes about two weeks, -so we are pretty busy. -Thank you. The electrical wiring is being installed on the lower levels. Two cranes take up and pour concrete into the forms. The offices will be made available in September of this year… Would you turn the volume down, Tomáš? Set up the thing already. We're about to start. Don't rush on me. I want to have a nice picture. -Take off the apron, will you? -Yeah. Okay, and now also the old ones. Everybody look into the camera and smile. Smile, David. Let me check it first. Jesus, David, you're unbelievable. Look at you! Can't you look normal for once? Come on, it's gonna get cold. But otherwise it looks good. Alright… -Bon appetite! -Bon appetite! When David gets himself a girlfriend we'll be a complete family. I don't think so. -Why wouldn't you get a girlfriend? -I'm handicapped. -So, how is your living together? -Very well. -Where exactly do you live in Prague? -In Smíchov. Close to the center. Will you have a nap after lunch? We have company, don't we? Have you even noticed? Well? 775-660-093. That's my phone number. You know my phone number? Were you going through my phone? No. So were you going through his phone or not? Don't lie! Well, I was. Do you remember all the numbers? -I don't. -Of course he does. Let me see. What's Vašek Pochobratský's number? -Tell us. -I don't know. -He's shy. Let him eat first. -But he knows it. Come on! What's the number? 604-460-990. What a memory, right! And the landline? 475-262-853. You see? -DELETE ALL CONTACTS -REMOVE ALL CONTACTS FROM PHONE MEMORY? -What do you want? -How much is it to Prague? Around three K. -Three K? -Three thousand. I see. Goodbye, then. Ústí nad Labem main station. Express train number 674 operated by Czech Railways… What was he wearing? Probably the same clothes as the day before, right? Black jeans… light striped shirt… And I also didn't see his dark blue hoodie and black sneakers at home. Has he left any goodbye note or something like that? No, nothing like that. He left behind his cell phone, though. When we checked it, we noticed that all the contacts and messages had been deleted. But he did take his keys with him, so maybe that's a good sign. It's hard to say. Did something like this happen in the past? -Did he ever mention leaving? -No, he didn't. Only once, a couple of years ago, we went for a walk in the woods and David disappeared. We were looking for him, calling his name, but we couldn't find him. Eventually we found him sitting on a branch above us. Watching us as we were looking for him. Did he tell you back then why he did it? He said he just wanted to hide to see if we'd be looking for him. He got a serious beating from me after that. We were really scared. Did he ever mention suicide? -No. -He did to me. But one never really took it seriously. If you knew him… I'd have never thought he could be capable of harming himself. -He's always so cautious. -Why didn't you say anything? I just thought he was not being serious. That he just wanted to get some attention or something. Like when he climbed that tree. That he wanted us to be worried about him. Very well. -What can we do now? -At the moment, nothing. All you can do is wait. He will be in the registry of missing persons so if somebody reports him, we'll have an idea about his whereabouts. The important thing is to have your cell phone on all the time… …scheduled arrival at 14:21. The train terminates here… -Hello. -Hi. -Cigarettes. -Which ones? Moon's. King size. -Anything else? -A lighter. And also this, that, this one… The one with those whores and the big boobs. Are you eighteen already? Let me see your ID. FANTASTIC SEXUAL TEASING Budějovická. -Please get off the train. -You have to leave the train. This way please. Keep moving. You have to get off as well. Thank you. Somebody jumped under the train. Is he dead? Yeah. He got run over. I'd rather get some booze. I'd drink the whole bottle, sink down into a hot bath and slit my wrists. But not across. That's how you only cut your tendons. You lose some blood, but it's risky. You have to do it lengthwise. That's how you make a deeper hole in your vein. Stop it, or I'll show you! Yes? -It's one hundred fifty, right? -It's one hundred fifty to where? It's one hundred fifty to Ústí, right? Ústí nad Labem? One-way or return? Do you want that ticket or not? Come closer. Closer still. Excuse me, where's Smíchov? This is all Smíchov. Let's cancel the dinner, Martin. I can't go out to a restaurant when David is God knows where. I wonder if he's still alive, poor thing. I need to be home in case he comes back. I've already canceled it. This four-year-old kid named Štěpán came to me today in the kindergarten. He's so cute. Anyway, he said: "Mrs. Teacher, will you play hide-and-seek with me?" Do you know what I mean? The other kids didn't want to play with him, so he came to me. Why should David come home anyway? What kind of life does he have here? He's got us. We love him. I lose it with him sometimes, but… You lose it with him all the time! Not sometimes. All the time! Why do you think he only talks to me? He's scared of you. But I can't hold it inside. I'd get a heart attack if I did. I have to let off steam or I'd get a stroke. And I should hold it inside? I have no right to let off steam? All those homework assignments I had to help him with. Every single afternoon. I patiently sat there and helped him because it was too much for you. Do you know how many times I wanted to lose it? But I didn't because he had to learn how to write. When he's shaving, I'm there to make sure he does it right. Or you send me to him because it's too much for you. So I sit there and watch over him. He needed to learn how to look after himself. Because who's gonna look after him when we're gone? Tomáš? I don't wanna be responsible for screwing up his future family and his whole life by burdening him with David. We've been through this for over 20 years. It would affect everybody. Being on alert all the time, all the constant care he demands. Plus those unbearable noises he makes. Nobody could deal with such a thing while keeping calm. You should go and see a doctor. A psychologist. He'd prescribe you some pills. It would be better for everybody. For you, me and David as well. Yeah. So in the end it's all my fault? Is that what you're saying? Is it my fault? Is that right? Check out that sleeping bag, man. He's having a good time out here. Just need to talk to him gently. "Hey man, you asleep?" It's gonna wake him up. Or touch him gently. "Hey, dude." Got something? "Are you alright or what?" Gonna check his shit. Dude's gonna wake up, I kick him in the face and he'll sleep again. No problem with that. Dude, he's got nothing. No way. Nothing at all. Looks like he stashed it in his shoes or something. Nothing, dude. -Take his shoes. They're neat, leather. -Okay. Let's get outta here. Sit down. So you don't have any money? You kiddin' me? You're gonna pay. Where's your money? I'm handicapped. So what?! Leave the food here and give me the notepad. What's your name? David Petrus. You got a cell phone? Show me the phone! I don't have it. Left it at home. The phone. What's your address? I'm starting to get pissed off. Větrná 38, Ústí nad Labem. Your parents' number, landline, or your father's, come on! -Landline or my father's? -Your old man's number. 773… 263-935. Let's make sure you're not fucking with me. Hello. Do you know David Petrus? Is he your son? Oh, you don't know him. I thought so. Bye, then. What was that number? You just made it up, didn't you? Grab his hands! You're not gonna make a fool out of me. You got no money and you wanna bullshit me? That's not gonna happen. But it was the right number. Really, I remember it. It was the right number! Honest! Well, I guess they don't want you anymore, then. They're sick of you, boy. They're sick and tired of a retard like you. Now listen to me! This was the last time you were here. If I see you around here again, I won't call the cops. No cops. I'll kill you on the spot. Wake up! This is the final stop. There you go. You won't have one? No. In case I need to drive somewhere. About a week ago, he was lying again, saying he hadn't touched the TV remote, but then all the channels were messed up. I told him: "Stop pissing me off and tell me the truth." He didn't say a word. The next day he brought me this cheap wine. He got it somewhere and I sent him away. Saying I didn't want it since he couldn't tell the truth. I should have cut my stupid gob off! 263-935. 935. 773-263-935. Martin! Martin! Were you trying to hurt yourself? But why would you? Such a handsome guy. Big eyes, slim… Everyone's looking forward to seeing you. It's dark already.
