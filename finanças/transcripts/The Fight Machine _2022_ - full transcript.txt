You hear it said that a man can change his personality... ...the very essence of who or what he is by no more than 5%. That's the sum and total change any one of us is capable of. At first you might think it sounds trivial. 5%. What's that? A fingernail cutting. A handprint on the window of a skyscraper. But when you stop and consider the vastness of the human psyche, then that number begins to acquire some real weight. Now think of the entirety of our known universe. Hundreds of billions of galaxies, each of them with hundreds of trillions of stars, planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. All of that visible matter only equals 5%. So considered on those terms, 5% is colossal. 5%? That's a whole new you. Yeah. Introduce me to your friend, babe. We've barely introduced ourselves. She's being coy. Paul Harris. Todd. Are you, uh, with her? That's very perceptive of you, Todd. -Paul. -You can't be serious. This lumberjack's got as much flair as an unflushed toilet. Shh! He might hear you. Yeah, I was thinking maybe you'd like to come back -- I'm a big fan of the beard. Do they make you wear a beard net -when you make mochaccinos? -Paul. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. -You know I'm kidding, right? -I'm sorry. That's cool. That's cool. I get it. I get it. Hey, seeing as how we're buddies now and all, maybe I should tell you to watch your mouth. Or else someone might put a boot up your ass. Are you threatening me, Todd? No, no. I'm just saying words have consequences, Paul. Like, if I were to call you a cocksucker motherfucker, that would have consequences, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it?! I'll leave you to it. Why did you talk to him like that? Hey. My God! Hey, Paul! I'm gonna split your wig, bud. You're fucking pathetic. Stop. Please don't. Please. I give. Stop it, please. I'll get started on that mochaccino for you. Oh, my God. Did they -- Did they do this to you because of me? Jesus. Oh, my God. Holy shit. You're good? Your tooth. Huh? Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna call my brother. He'll get his buddies, and they'll come help us. Paul? Paul! What the fuck? Chickenshit! -What's up? -Ohh! Top of the morning to you, lazybones. Lazybones? Why? 'Cause I actually got some sleep. What did you do? You pull another all-nighter at Fritz's? Oh, Robby, you should have seen it. It was glorious. I was on a roll, right up until the point that I went all in on a pair of ladies and the other guy was holding kings. I should have learned a long time ago ladies are nothing but trouble. Speaking of which, how's old Katie-pie, yeah? You wake up a little extra tired this morning? We're just friends. Friends with benefits? Who you sparring with? Oh, my boy. Always changing the subject. Well, that big fella there. Louie Scarpella. Heavyweight out of Buffalo. Trainer wants to work him against a flat-footed grinder. Actually said that right to my fucking face. Can't believe. You guys having a little social hour out there or what? Robby, get your ass in gear. What are you playing hard to get, Tom? Your gentleman caller's waiting for you? Yeah, yeah. Time to make the doughnuts. -Work out. -All right. Robby, Come on. Let's go to the machine. Hold your horses. Don't chase, don't chase. Work for it. Work for it. Come on, Robby. Find your range. Find your range. Come on, son! Harder! Breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe. Pop it. Snap that punch! Well, well, well. You, son of mine, are late. Extenuating circumstances. Yowch. Jeez, that's a beaut. Ow! Lay off. I'm not a grape. How'd that happen? Fell down some stairs. Hmm. Well, I was gonna ask you to give some Chinese investors a tour, but I guess I'll have to do it now. Oh, hey, How was your date last night? That face, pretty sweet, huh? Yeah. She'll inherit a fortune one day. Nice ass too. I think I'm gonna take the day off. Yeah. Good idea. And go get your teeth fixed. You look like you ought to be giving hay rides through the Appalachia. Hey, you guys need any help? Whoo-hoo-hoo! Fuck! Fuck. What the hell happened? Are you okay? I'm fine. Just hit some black ice. I thought you were gonna get your teeth fixed. I spent the afternoon picking grapes. Picking grapes? Evening, Mr. Harris. Oh, hey, Mike. What's the damage? There's some pretty extensive damage to it. It's probably going to take two, maybe three weeks. - Christ. - Oh, in the meantime, here's a list of the loaner cars. I can see why these are the loaners. I guess I'll take the Lexus coupe. Wait, wait, no. Just give me the worst piece of shit you have. Hey, Rueben, where's your brother? Why does he owe you money? Supposed to be training with him. I'll get him. I'll go. Yeah? Good boy, Robby. Hard for him to spar with my foot in his ass. -Hey, Fritz. -Hey. What's up, Robby? Um, is my uncle here? Ha. Does the pope shit in the woods? Of course he's here, man. Go on in. He's been here all night. He'll be lucky if he's got to pennies to rub together. Tommy. Tommy. Uncle Tommy, wake up. Wake up. Hey. Robby. Mm. You shouldn't be here, kiddo. Yeah, well, it was either me or my dad. Oh, in that case, glad to see you. Oh, look what you did. Big one. Oh, bad boy. Bad boy. So when is your next fight, Robby? Golden Gloves qualifiers. You need a cut man? What makes you think he's going to need a cut man? Just want to be a part of it. Oh, everybody wants to be a part of it now. Ooh! -See you tonight? -No, you've bled me dry. I need time to recoup. Maybe on the weekend, though, Fritzy, huh? Aren't you at the barn on the weekend? Oh, it's that time of the month. No, thanks. I feel like 10 pounds of shit in a five-pound bag. Yeah, Fritzy said you were playing all night. Yep. It's a sucker's game. Don't ever do it, Robby, all right? -Remember that. -Okay. Who am I sparring with again? Scarpella. Oh, fuck. Scarpella. -What? -He ain't going nowhere. I know it. You know it. He probably knows it too. How am I supposed to help someone who's beyond help? You know what that makes me, huh? A punching bag for 15 bucks a round. Then why do you do it? If you don't like it, just don't step through the ropes, Tommy. Robby, you know there are things in this life you got to do whether you like it or you don't. Come on, Harris, you fucking pansy. I've seen 10-year-old girls with more muscles on their bodies than you, man. And when you train, you're supposed to use fucking man weights, not fucking girly weights. Get your ass under that bar, man. It's go time. Come on. Come on, lift it up. Come on! Come on. Show me what you got! This is the fucking money rep. Put it up, baby. Show me what you got in your fucking body, man. Get that motherfucking weight up! Put it up! Show me what you got. Come on, have some fucking testicles for once in your goddamn life. Get the fucking weight up. Come on, man. Bring it up. Bring the fucking weight up. Oh, fuck. Sorry about that. It's all right, man. Happens to the best of us. Only means you're giving yourself 110%. Yeah. And to be perfectly honest with you, the first time I squatted a thousand, I crapped my pants. We all do it. Hit the fucking shower. You're stinking. Good job. Hey, good work today, faggot. Thanks. What do you think about this stuff? -Does this work? -All shit. Chalk dust. Crap. Testosterone enanthate. Rolls-Royce of performance enhancement. This will make a fucking man out of you. Is that stuff safe? Safe? Nothing's fucking safe. You could walk out of here and you could get hit by a fucking bus. How do you take it? Spongier than a loaf of bread, man. And it jiggles around like fucking Christmas pudding. Seriously, look at it. Yeah, I guess it could use some work. A blind man could tell you it needs some fucking work. Now hold the fuck still, 'cause if this goes in too deep, you'll get a knot like a monkey's fist, and you're not gonna fucking like it. Done. Is that it? Is that it? No, that's not it. From now on, you got to come in here five days a week. You got to cut off the carbs, like bread, potatoes, and pasta. You got to put in at least 150 grams of protein in your body a day. And lay off the grain whiskey. What's grain whiskey? Alcohol, dumbass. Beer. This shit will kill you. Get you some D-Bol on the way out. Hello? Hello? Excuse me? If you're a bill collector, you can bugger off. I ain't got no money. -No, I'm -- I'm not. -Hey! Look, you can't get blood from a goddamn stone. I'm tapped out. -No, I saw your sign. -What? Oh. Oh. Oh, Jesus. Oh. Sorry about this. I'm Lou Cobb. I own the place. -Oh. -How you doing? -Paul Harris. -Yeah. Fighter? You got a fighter's build. You -- You haven't worked with Ernie Riggs -over at Knockout, have you? -No. Good, 'cause Ernie Riggs is a piece of shit. So... How old are you? 26. Ah, 26. Look, I ain't gonna lie to you here. You're kind of over the hill when it comes to Golden Gloves and shit like that. Kind of too old for a rookie, you know? Yeah. Take a stance. Take a stance. Come on, take a -- take a stance. -Take a stance? -Yeah. Throw a right cross. Come on. Another one. That's all right. Here, left. Again. Well, your balance is all right. It's okay. Sure you haven't fought before? I mean, you got a fighter's face, fighter's smile. I fell down some stairs. Yeah? Yeah. Those were some kick-ass stairs, huh? Here we are. Home sweet home. This is it. Ta-da. So, what do you say? Want to learn how to give those stairs a kick in the head? What you working on, kiddo? -A haiku. -Bless you. -It's a Japanese poem. -Oh. Why don't you write an ode to your handsome uncle? "Tommy dearest, tell me true. Why do all the prettiest girls L-O-V-E you?" You quit screwing around, Tommy. I'm helping Robby with his poetry. You wouldn't know Shakespeare if he crawled out of the grave and bit you on your big, fat fucking ass. We're gonna be back at the usual time. Unless your uncle's face is so busted up that it turns a person off his meal, meet us at Macy's, yeah? -Let's go. -Good luck. You don't need luck when you got the skills to pay the bills, boy. Mm! "There once was a boxer from Nantucket who lost his piece in the spit bucket." Let's go! I wish we weren't still doing this shit. Eh. This is the last time. Yeah? This is the last one? One of the last. You imagine that this was gonna be the way you were gonna cap your career? Remember that night that you fought at the fucking Garden? Madison Square Garden. You. Yep. That was a lifetime ago. Yeah. Knock him out quick tonight, okay? Hey, Manning. Hey, lads. -Hey, Fritzy. -Hey, Rueben. -How you been, brother? -Yeah, good, good. Looking sharp. So, what do you think? Second round? Yeah. Second round. In and out like a fiddler's elbow. Oh, sounds good to me. You know, every time I'm in this fucking place, I feel I should be wearing one of those rubber aprons like they do at the slaughterhouse. -Jesus. -Rueben, stop being so precious. Rueben, stop being... My brother, he's so precious! Look at that big fella shake a paw. Fight goes until one man can't answer the bell. Man goes down, both fighters take a rest. I won't accept no outright foul. But remember, out there operates under laws. This place here, consider it international waters! Yeah! Yeah! Knuckle up! Knuckle up! Katie, you live three houses down. Why are you dressed for a polar expedition? It's freezing. Ohh! Hey, do you have anything good to eat? -Well, I've got meat sauce. Ah, yeah, okay, sure. Do you want noodles or toast? Toast? You're kidding, right? No. Tommy loves it on toast. Oh, eww! Speaking of Tommy, where is he and your pops? Come on, circle, circle, circle! Let's go! Go to the body, Tommy! Go to the body. Ah! My...eye. Ah, get the fuck up, Tommy! What the fuck are you doing? Put him down. Tommy! Tommy! Hey! Check his hands! His hands have something on them! His hands! Check his hands! Sit down. Sit down. What the fuck are you doing? The guy's wide open. He's got fucking mods all over his fucking hands. It stings like a son of a bitch. Plus, he ain't all there upstairs. Who the fuck cares? Here you go. No, no, no, no, no. He's slow. His fucking breath, it smells like a baby. It smells like a baby. Listen to me, he may be slow, but he's more than fucking happy to be punching you in the fucking face. Hit him back. How about that? Sit still. Gonna sting. You fucking deserve it. There we go. You fight this round, or are you gonna keep flirting with him? -I'm going in. -Knock him out. Let's go. Come on, Tommy! Box a little, you fucking elephant! Good shot. Nice shot, Tommy. Good body shots, Tommy. Good shot, Tommy. Get up, you idiot! Get up! Get up! Just stay down. There ain't no shame in it. You're one tough hombre. Get up, you idiot! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! -Get up! -Get up! Get up! Done, done. Done, done, done. Tommy. Tommy. We can get it over. Shame on you! Your kid's feeble-minded, and you know it! I catch you running him around here again, you and me, we're gonna have business. Tommy! We got to get the fuck out of here. Let's go. A frozen ball of turd? Yeah, there's this plane flying from Montreal to Los Angeles. And, like, a frozen ball of, like, shit and piss and stuff fell out, and it smashed right through this guy's roof in Rochester, and it killed him instantly. And what was crazy is that he was on the toilet, like, when it happened. I really don't think that's going to make for a good haiku. Well... Why don't you just write about something that you know? Like boxing. Oh, God. No, thanks. Anything but boxing. How about that? What, Mr. Cryptic? The curtains? No, not the curtains. The -- The view. Because I've gotten older, so my perspective's changed, but... Like, there -- The tree and the fence and the sky. Everything's stayed the exact same. Grab a pen, son. Strike while the iron's hot. Okay. "The view out of my --" Wait. Go ahead. Yeah. Okay. Um... "The view out of my..." That's your first line. "...kitchen window..." Three more syllables. Three more. "...remains the same." No. Uh... "...stays the same..." Nice. One more line, five more beats. "...since I was a boy." Simple. But I like it. Key lime. Key lime. Okay, yeah. See you soon. Thanks. Do you want to -- you want to come for a slice of pie with me and my dad and my uncle? -No. -Oh. I got to go. My work here is done. -Thank-- -See ya. See ya. Oh, there he is. What took so long? Oh, did Katie-pie come over tonight? Yeah. So? She's a little cutie. just like her mother. She's practically my sister. You two grew up together. That don't make her your sister. -You win? -Hey, don't change the subject. I need the details, please. No, he, uh, did not win. Because you threw in the towel. You should have seen the scared look on his pretty little face. Hey, that was no man I was fighting. It was a pain-crazing mongoloid who fed off of punishment. -Thank you. -Thank you. I used to work at this private whiskey bar called the Ancient Order of the Hibernian. I was doing door one night. This guy rolls up. He doesn't have a card, so I tell him to bugger off. He says, "Yo, bro, I'm Irish. Let me in, please." Say, "Sorry, pal. No card, no dice." He doesn't like that none too much. He comes at me. We tussle a little bit. I push him. He goes down the stairs. Jesus Christ, I think he's dead. But he gets right back up, comes up those stairs. Says, "Yo, bro, I'm Irish. Please let me in." We tussle again. He goes down the stairs. Sure as shit, he gets right back up and comes up those stairs. And I say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Buddy. You must be Irish. Right this way." Oh, come on, come on. No, go down. Get down on your haunches. Get down. You get a little spring in you. You're walking around like Frankenstein's monster. And look, tuck that chin in. You're hanging it out like a goddamn piñata. Keep your elbows in. Come on. All right, now spin out of there. Thataboy. Come on. What's your name? Did I get knocked out? What's your name? Pippi Longstocking. I'm just shitting you. Paul. Paul Harris. -How long was I out? -You were out for a while. Set you up with an uppercut and a straight right, right on the snooze button. All right, let's get back at it. All right. What was it you did before you showed up here? I worked at my parents' winery. Their dream, not mine. So, what? Why boxing? Because I want to be stronger. Stronger how? Well, I was watching this documentary on World War I a few weeks ago. These vets were talking about mercy kills. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? And how if a man in your unit, if he was a liability, they'd put a bullet in his brain, made it look like an accident. Because back then it didn't matter how much money or influence your parents had. Just came down to the fact that, "Do I trust this man with my life?" All right? And as I watched it... ...I couldn't help but wonder, if I was around back then, would I be the one facedown in the bunker with a fellow soldier's bullet in my skull? Oh. Or would you be the guy standing there with a weapon in your hand, huh? Huh? All right, here. Double up here, and then I'm gonna swing at you. Yah! Hey. Good night, Lou. Thank you. Hey, come on in. I want to talk to you. Sit down. Have a seat. How you feeling? Can you breathe? Kind of stuffy. -Yeah. -Little bit. You know, years ago, fighters would go from town to town, just like gunslingers, you know, plying their trade. They would toe a line in the sand and defy anyone to come across that line. In one 10-to-12-hour a day, they'd fight maybe 15, 16 men. And when they were done, they'd take a little bit of money, stick it in their pocket, grab a bus or hop a train out of town. Now, sure, they did it for cash. People like Thunderbird Layne. But that's not why they did it. They did it because they were born to fight, the same way some men are born to be scientists or architects or doctors. You know? But soon, society moved in, putting up ropes and rings, putting gloves on and making money off it. And the bare knucklers like Thunderbird Layne there, they kind of like went the way of the dodo. Almost. These places still exist? Uh-huh. Do me a favor, Lou, don't yank my chain. I'm not doing that. I could take you, test what kind of gas you got in your tank, whether you can make it through this whole phase. And if you do, I want a deal that we'll put on a pair of gloves, go inside the ropes, get your name up in the marquee and in the lights and make some real money. -We got a deal? -Yeah. Yeah. Now, you're a bleeder. I want you to go see this guy named Sandercott. Lou sent me. Nose or brow? Yeah, your brows look okay. Process of elimination -- nose. Head into the shitter. So, what are you planning on? Well, didn't Lou tell you? Typical. Electric cauterizing wand. Fuses veins. I'm gonna cauterize the soft tissue in your nostrils. Once it scars up, you're never gonna bleed again. Can't this be done in a hospital? Ohh, it's nonessential surgery. Government's not gonna pay for that. Plus there's all those questions. See, with me, you get "don't ask, don't tell," and I only charge 50 bucks. Up front. So... Uh, I don't have any change Oh, that's okay. That's okay. I know, baby! I know. Popsy will be there in a minute. Worse than kids, huh? Let's give you a little cleanup. All right. Here comes. Oh. There you go. There you go. Um... You're gonna want to bite down hard on this. I'm not gonna lie to you. This is gonna sting like a motherfucker. All right, here you go. That's it. All right. Breathe. Yep. And here comes the train. Years ago, fighters used to go from town to town like gunslingers, you know, plying their trade. They would roll into town. They would toe a line in the sand and defy anyone to come across that line. Aah! Aaaaah! Oh, come on, babies. Get out of there. That's not for you. Come on. Come on, come on. Hey, we're all done. Huh? I'd get you a lollipop, but I'm all out. You want a Vicodin? I don't think those are Vicodin. Sure they are. The guy down the road makes them. I'll take two. What the hell is wrong with you?! Okay. Not to worry. Everything's -- Everything's absolutely fine. Why don't we -- Why don't we all just go into the kitchen... and try our new Riesling? You're gonna love it. It's a great year for the Riesling. Apparently. Well, that was the quickest end to a party I've ever seen. You're lucky he's a business acquaintance of mine. You might be looking at a serious lawsuit. So tell me, have you figured out how all this is benefiting you yet? Dad, did ever occur to you for one fleeting moment that I didn't want the life you staked out for me? Staked out for you? I only want you to be happy. But you never showed the slightest ambition. Yeah, well, why didn't you teach me how to be a man? Oh, give me a fucking break. I taught you how to be a man. A man for today. Oh, w-what should I have done, Paul? Should I have taken you out into the backwoods and taught you how to live off the land? Trapping rabbits and skinning deer? Or maybe -- maybe when you were 16, I shouldn't have bought you that Mustang you begged for. Maybe that would have made you a better man. Christ. God. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go set up my conjugal bed for the night. Ohh, boy. We got Marty Kane. Listen, Robby. He's a pretty big kid. He's got some skills. But he's not fucking sharp like you. You should tear him apart. God damn it, Robby! I didn't lose. Yeah, but you didn't win, did you? You didn't win. It was a draw, a lousy goddamn draw. And you know the thing that fucking kills me is, not once, not twice, but three or four times you had him, and you did nothing with it. You know, we might not make it out of the preliminaries now. Fuck, that kid was shit. Shouldn't have been in the same ring as you. You blew it. You b-l-e-fucking-ew it. God! You even care? You know, there is this amazing new technology called texting. Oh, really? You a little greased there, Tully? I don't know. Maybe. So is there like a law against that or something? -Actually, yeah. -Oh, actually? How did the qualifiers go? I don't want to talk about that. Are you gonna invite me in? You know, for a guy who lives and breathes boxing, it's kind of funny how much you hate it. So? Who loves their job, Katie? You think my dad loves hauling his ass out of bed every day at 2:00 a.m. to bake bread? You think you mom loves working E.R. every night? Everybody has obligations. Why should I be above that? Yeah, but whose obligations? For a tough guy, you sure get shoved around a lot. Fuck you, Katie. What are you doing here? Darren just got his first sonnet published in the local paper. We were just celebrating. You had a sonnet published. Whoopee. I do it for the love of the words. And knowing that it's actually gonna get me somewhere someday. Where exactly is your gay little poetry writing gonna take you that boxing's not gonna take me. Well, I think it's kind of simple, man. All you got to do is look at your Tully family tree. You can start with your uncle, your father, your grandfather -- hell, probably even your Great-grandfather Tully before him. You know, it's like, where did boxing take any of those knuckleheads? Nowhere. The difference between me and you is that I get to leave this town one day, I get to go somewhere better. But you, you never get to leave because you've tied yourself up with boxing. Out of all the sports, man, boxing. You picked the dying one. I really hope you win those Golden Gloves there, Robby. I truly do. 'Cause if you don't, you'll be missing out on, what, like the only good thing that ever happened in your miserable little life. Rob, stop. Do it. Punch me, Tully! Everyone knows it's all you're good for. Don't. Rob! What the fuck? Rob, stop. Fuck! Fuck of off me! Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Rob! Yeah, your dad's still up. I don't think I can face him right now. Speaking of which, I didn't think Kane got the better of you that bad. So, what happened this afternoon? I don't know. Just wasn't on. I don't know about on, but seemed to me that maybe went, I don't know, soft on him. I don't know what else to tell you. Oh, hold on. Help me up. Ohh. There's my two. favorite people on the whole wide world. You look like shit, Reub. Drunken style don't suit you. You're not wearing a rain barrel. Does that mean you're the big winner, Tommy? Mm. I am not. That's my son. -The great white pacifist. -Okay. Hey, kiddo, why don't you hit the hay? I'll just take care of all this. I would like -- I'd like to have a discussion. I'd like to discuss what happened today. -I just want to go to bed. -No, I want things. I want to know why you tanked the fight. -I didn't tank. -Don't listen to him. He's loaded and talking nonsense. I wasn't loaded this afternoon, and I've been around long enough to recognize a piss tank. Okay. Off to bed, kiddo. Let's go. Get your fucking hands off me. -Let go of me. -Rueb, pull it together. Pull it together. In the ring, when you hit a man, you earn his respect. Out there in the street or in the schoolyard, he doesn't have to respect you. But in boxing, there's the law. Now, it may be rough, but it's fair. And I can't tell you that you're not gonna get hurt. But that pain is temporary. And it's not as bad as the pain of a wasted life. I don't care about getting hurt, Dad. I'm just worried that this is all there's ever gonna be. No. I want the same thing as you. I want you to get out of this town. I want you to be better than me. And boxing is your ticket. You think it's a trap. It's a doorway. And I want you to walk through it. I don't want you to ever look back at my face again. Nice jacket, Harris! You look like a faggot cloud drifted to earth. Come on, be a man. Be a big fucking man. Bring it up! Yeah, yeah! Yeah, buddy. Come on! Again! Come on! And down. You don't need me. What the fuck?! Close the fuck-- close the door! Close the fucking door! Close the door, man! Aaah! Whoo! Fucking animal. Fucking animal! Aaaah! Pedal to the metal, baby! Aaaah! Who wants some tomato soup? Whoo! I'm calling the cops. I am the cops! Ha ha! Lou! Tell me about that place. You been out jogging, kid? You sound gassed. Gladiators don't have to win money. Yeah, I know. How's your snout? Heal up yet? It's fine. -Don't worry about it. -Heh. We'll sort something out. Sounds like you're ready. Yeah. Fuck yeah, I'm ready. Fuck yeah. We got a call about a disturbance tonight. Wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? I did actually see a suspicious fellow back there. He was a real prowler type. He was tall, skinny, wearing a sequined eye patch. -He was riding a griffin. -A griffin. Yeah. Half eagle, half lion. Beautiful creatures. They're great lovers too. They fuck like banshees. All right. License and registration. You're not Jack Harris's son? The winery owner? Lordy, it is you. Put this car in gear and get yourself straight home. What? But, Officer, I just egged the almighty fuck out of that house back there. Just a boy being a boy as far as I'm concerned. I'm 26. I'm 26! -I'm 26 years old. -Settle down. I'm doing you a favor. Drive safe. And tell your old man Jimmy Steele sends his regards. God damn it. Fuck! Fuck, fuck! Raah! Fucking ruin everything! So I'm gonna ruin your stupid, precious vineyard! Raah! Oh, shit! Did you find him? Well, keep looking. Check the cellar. Check the greenhouse. Check the -- the ditch beside the back field. -Check the -- -Wait. Wait, Jack. No, we got him. What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, my God. Paul! -Paul. -God. I cannot for the life of me figure out what the hell is wrong with you, son, but you need help -- serious fucking help. -Jack. -Oh, the silent treatment. Oh, you think that'll help? Hey, how about this? Say goodbye to your credit cards, buddy boy. Do you guys remember that killer whale? The one from the amusement park the animal rights group freed a few years ago. That whale was born and bred in captivity. Its whole life it was fed, cared for, and protected. And all it knew how to do was do tricks at the blow of a whistle. I can't help but imagine its small little world blowing up when it was set free -- all the strange fish, the new unlimited waters, not knowing the language of other whales that she might meet. Her once safe existence suddenly became completely lawless, lacking parameters. -Paul... -They found her not even a week later, floating near a wharf with her belly ripped open and her tongue and lower jaw eaten. Shut up and let me finish! I think about that poor whale, and I wonder who's to blame. Who's to blame for all this? The protesters for setting her free? The amusement park for keeping her penned up for all those years. And the more I think about it, nobody is to blame. Everybody had their hearts in the right place. But the reality is, is that whale was adrift in a place that she didn't understand, scared shitless, and so fucking witless that she didn't last a week on her own. But what if she was given the chance to strengthen herself so she might have survived? But why this -- this self-sabotaging quest you're on? Why suffer just to suffer? 'Cause people need to suffer! They need to feel pain and experience want and get smashed apart in order to fix themselves, to become something totally new! Three. Roll it. Come on. Keep the elbows in. Guard it up. There you go. Nice. Nice. Go try that right. Now, roll it. Step in there, roll over, and turn your hips. Shit. Hey, Everett. Come on. Breathe. Look here. Come on. Take a nice deep breath. Come on. You ready to rock and roll? Come here. Give me your hands. So, what's your name? Rex. Rex Appleby. And, uh, what do you do, Rex? I train killer whales. To do all those tricks and stuff? I rehabilitate them. To put them back into the wild. Cool. So, what's your pleasure? Oh, I can do that. -Yeah. -Yeah. Come on, give me your best shot. -Ohh! -Huh. You like this, don't you? Wait. Wait, wait. Oh! Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Oh, you better check the warranty on this oven, because its goose is cooked! You're gonna break the fucking oven. Oh, yes! I would love to dedicate this win to -- to Gummy Stu, Stinky Mulligan, Old Armless Joe down at the VFW hall. We did it, boys! Oh, golly gee, Tom Tully. That was some fight. You and the stove, you exchanged some pretty heated prefight words. You said the stove didn't have the legs to make it through the later rounds. The stove, he put up one hell of a fight. You got some moxie, stove. But tonight, tonight is Tom Tully's night, baby. Whoo! That's right, it was Tom Tully's night. Now -- Now, the question that everyone's asking is, what comes next for Tom "Boom Boom" Tully? Well, that fridge over there, he's my mandatory challenger. But that toaster, he's been eyeballing me all month, flapping his gums. Well, buddy, you don't sing it, you bring it. You bring the pain train! Whoo-whoo! Stern words from a stern man! Shut up! Shut... Enough. You, you've got homework. You have a fight. Stay focused. It's not a goddamn joke. Lighten up, killjoy. So you're going to Macy's after? Yeah. Another day in the salt mines, kiddo. I love you. Hey. We'll, uh, break bread later. Go get 'em. So you're off the shit, are you? Yeah, listen, that guy you seen the past few weeks walking around in my skin, that wasn't me. He took me to the dark side of the woods. But I'm -- I'm back. I'm back. That's good. That's good. -Hey, Lou. -Hey, Manning. Who we got here? He's a tough kid out of my club. He's got balls on him like a burglar, and he'll hold his own mud. On you go, then. Thank you, boss. Welcome to the circus, young man. Hey, look, I'm gonna go catch the first fight. You interested? No, I'm gonna sit. Yeah? Oh. Fight like a dog. What's that? That's the best mindset to put yourself in. Become a dog. Dogs aren't afraid of pain. They're afraid of thunder, fireworks, the vacuum cleaner. All things their tiny little brains can't comprehend. Yet a dog is not the least bit frightened by pain. Even the smallest dog will take on a dog three times its size and literally fight to the death. So fight like a dog. Thanks, Manning. You're up next. Looks like Manning's throwing you a bone tonight. - That guy? - Uh-huh. That's one big slab of humanity, Lou. He's an ex-pro. Now, the good thing is he won't hit you more than he has to. If you earn his respect, he'll put you out with one punch. So what do you think? You gonna do this, or do I got to tell Manning -- No, no. I want to fight him, Lou. I might be nervous, but I'm not afraid. All right. Good for you. Now let's get you taped up. Let's have a clean fight. Knuckle up. Don't worry. I'll take it easy on you. No, please don't. Work the jab, Tommy. Good shot, Tommy. Jab, Tommy. Nice. Good shot, Tommy. Create some space, Tommy! Hit him harder. Lean on him, Tommy. Manning, this is fucking bullshit. Go at him, Tommy. Nice shot, Tommy! Knocked the fuck out! Oh! Oh, yeah! Come on, get in here. Get in here. I can't breathe through my nose. What? Look here, look here. All right, all right. That was that cross. It's going up. Here you go. All right. Now, face me. Oh, yeah. Now open your mouth. Open your mouth. Ah! There you go. Try it. Can you breathe? -Can you breathe? -Yeah. -Yeah, I can breathe. -Yeah, see? That kid is a glutton. Listen to me. Last time they put you in with the feeb. Now you're in with this little punch pug. -Lean on him. -What if he won't go down? You make him go down. I don't want to hurt him, Rueb. Tommy, it is what it is. He chose to be in there. Let's go. Come on, don't piss around with him. Come on! Good shot, Tommy. Good shot, Tommy. Now it's fucking done! Fucking protect yourself. Focus. Focus, Tommy. Focus, Tommy! Let's go, Tommy. Stay focused. Put him out of his misery! Tommy, the kid knows the fucking rules. Finish this. Tommy. Call an ambulance! It's not how it works. You take care of your own. How am I supposed to do that? Any way you can. Anywhere but here. Get him on my fucking shoulder. Get him up. Up, up, up, up. Let's go. Come on, Tommy. There we go. Up. Let's go. Open the fucking door to my car, Fritz. -Lou, I -- -No, no, no, no. Don't do that. He knew what he was getting into. It's the nature of the beast. Now, come on. Let's get out of here. Come on, now. Help! Can we get some fucking help here?! This way. Hello?! Um, slice of pecan, please. And, uh, extra whip. See you in 10. What's that? Insurance bullshit. They're claiming that because... ...because Tommy didn't make a living will, and when he's declared in a "persistent vegetative condition," that he becomes a ward of the state. And then they're gonna -- they're gonna put his name on an organ donor list and give the rest of him to science. Fuck that shit. There's no fucking way. Over my dead fucking -- Why did you let him? Why did I let him what? Why did you let Uncle Tommy fight? Why didn't you stop him? Why didn't you stop him? When didn't you tell him how stupid it was? Why didn't you refuse to go along -- How many fucking times were you there when I told him how stupid it was? How many fucking times? A thousand times? You told him. But you weren't forceful about it. Because it's not my choice. It's not my choice. If it would have been my choice, he would have stopped fighting years ago. If he goes to fight, I'm there to make sure he doesn't get hurt. Yeah, but he got hurt! I know he got hurt. It's my fault? You want to blame me? Fine. Fine. I blame myself. A man acts according to his own wishes. He's my brother. He's not my slave. Right, champ? He's gonna pull through, Robby. Your uncle's a -- he's a born fighter, through and through. Just like you. A born fighter, Dad? I wasn't born a fighter. I was raised one. You made me that way. You made me that way from day one. All you ever taught me was that fighting was the only way I'd have a place in this world. I wasn't like that when I was born. -You made me that way. -Best fucking thing I ever did. I was your fucking father. That's what we do. We get you ready. When we were young, we talked about being champs. It was bullshit. It was a pipe dream. But you, you are destined for great things. It's your life. You want to throw it away? Fuck it. Fuck it. -Hey, Lou. -Hey. What was that guy's name again? Who, Tom Tully? From the other side of the Falls? Yeah. You doing all right? Yeah. I was just curious. I'm so sorry. I never saw it happening this way. I never meant to hurt you. It was never about that. Who are you? Nobody. Just visiting. Who are you? He's my uncle. What are you doing here? I was just seeing how he was doing. Yeah, well, he's not doing too well, as you can see. Where are you from? I haven't seen you around. Across the river. Canadian. You fighting to make ends meet? Money was never an issue. What are you fighting for, then? I don't know. To see what I was capable of. My uncle was a solid fighter. This shouldn't have happened. Everybody knows you got in a lucky punch. But that doesn't change anything. I want to hurt you. I more or less have to. Well, if it'll answer anything, then maybe I owe you, but I certainly don't want to hurt you. And then again, maybe I do. I think we both know a place. Robby. How are you holding up, kid? I'm fine. Um, I need to talk to you about something. Is it Tommy's debts? Don't worry about it. I cleared the books. Honestly, your uncle is such a lousy player it makes me sick to think about collecting. Okay, thanks. But it's not about that. What? I want you to take me to the barn. The barn. Why is that? Does it matter? Well, if you're looking for my help, then you bet your ass it does. How old are you anyway, Rob? I'm old enough to make my own choices. It might be. But the question you need to ask yourself is, do you really think Tommy -- Tommy would want you doing this? I don't know. But nothing else answers anything. Oh, kid. Come on in for a beer. So, you ready for this? Never been more ready in my life. So, just we are clear. Anything gets ugly in there, I'm throwing in the towel. That's the price of this ride. Okay, kid? All right. Let's go get this done. Hey, Manning. How you doing? Who'd you brung me, Fritzy? Amateur fighter from my neck of the woods. Rob Tully. Yeah, I heard of you. You're hot shit. There are plenty of safer places to find a fight, kid. Yeah, well, he has a specific one in mind. I run a blind draw here. So it'd be against the rules. Yeah. But since I make 'em, I guess I could break 'em. Huh? Machine. Machine feels no pain. Machine is not broken by fear. Machine made of titanium... ...and bulletproof glass and ballistic rubber. A machine. I am a machine. I'm really sorry about all this. Hey, come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fuck him up! Nice shot! Yeah! Whoo! Nice one, Robby. Fuck you, Tommy. Have a seat. All right, you got a few good shots in there. Listen, you got to fight him smart, not angry. You hear me? Not angry, Robby. Everything is up here, okay? And watch out for that right hand. Okay? Something wrong with my tooth. Here. Open up. Oh, yeah, that's loose. That ain't going back in. Let's put a little of this on here. Ah. Sit still. Let me clean you up. No. Let it bleed a little. Look, it's gonna get in your eyes. It'll fuck you up. Let it bleed. Let's go! Come on, let's do this! All right. Whatever. Fucking right, brother! Yes! Great work, Robby. You stupid little fucker. How do I look, Lou? Like some animal shat you out sideways. Now, listen to me. You got to get in there and put him away. I know! I know! I know, but I've hit him as hard as I've ever hit anybody. -He's not going away. -Then you hit him harder! With everything you got, yes?! Why don't you just lay down and quit while you still got a face? No. No, no. It's not about winning or losing. It's about moving forward with fists raised without hesitation or fear. Cut my tape off. What? Why the hell you want to do that? 'Cause I want to feel it. Paul, stay down! Stay down, man. Stay down. Thank you. Open this up. Fritz, get in here. Help me get him to the car. Ah! Aah! Oh, there you are. We put that guy in the car. He's beat up pretty bad, but he'll live. Robby? What's the matter? Hey, kid. What's going on? Robby. for God's sake, you won. Kid, you won. All right, we're here. What? We're here. It's time to get out. No. No hospital. Oh, come on, kid. Be sensible. Your face is wide open in places. No hospital. All right. Well, this one's on you. You got to be one of the most obstinate son of a bitches I've ever run into. Now, it's been a long time since I've done this, so hold still. If you want painkillers, you're gonna have to go 50 meters back that way. There we go. Then we're gonna go in the top side. Hold still. Robby? What happened? I'm so sorry, Rueben. I brought him straight here. I promise, by the time I saw what he did to himself, it was too late. Robby? Sit down, sit down, sit down. Oh, Robby. What did you... What did you do? Ohh. No, son. I'm sorry, Dad. I just couldn't do it anymore. I wanted to do it for you and Tommy, but I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't do it for me, Dad. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Listen to me. Listen to me. You're gonna be fine. You need a doctor. I'm gonna get you a doctor. Okay? You stay here. Stay with me, huh? So sorry. Hey. Hey, Robby. It's okay. You're okay. You're home. I know. I know. Where do you want to go? Want to go home? I don't know where that is. Well, you ain't coming back to the club. I don't want you anywhere near it. Can you take me to the bus stop, then? Absolutely. Can I get my fighter's purse? What, do I got to remind you you lost the fight tonight, huh? Tom Tully. I beat him, didn't I? That's everything I got. It should get me to the next town. Yeah. Hey, Lou, thank you for everything you've done for me, for getting me here. Just get out of my car. Go. What a waste. Bus 2093 now arriving. Hi. Where's the next bus out heading? Uh, Thunder Bay. It's the murder capital of Canada. That'll work. Uh, is that return? One way. The name on my birth certificate still reads Paul Harris. My town and date of birth are still the same. But that person who my parents raised, who my frat brothers knew, who once walked the halls of the winery, he exists no more. So if I stand for anything, let it be as a testament to change. That full 5%. A whole new you.
