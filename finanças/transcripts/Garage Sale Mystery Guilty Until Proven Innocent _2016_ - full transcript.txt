Is this bracelet correct? You are 1940s top to bottom absolutely authentic. What kind of party is this? It's a murder mystery weekend. Have you ever been on one? A couple of times. Oh, excuse me. So, are you happy with the earrings? Can I help you? Hi, Jenn. Sandra, hi. Um... I know you used to collect these. I can't believe you remembered. Thank you. Well, it... It's been too long. It has. I've got news. I'm closing my shop. It's a good thing. So if you'd like to swing by, I'll give you first dibs on anything you want. Okay. Is tomorrow good? That works. I'll see you then. I'll see you tomorrow. Was that Sandra? Weren't you two kind of on the outs? We were. Hmm. I sit there, and I don't understand any of it. Maybe it's genetic. I was never good at philosophy. If you want to know if a tree makes a noise when it falls in the forest, leave a tape recorder out there. Have you seen your brother? On his computer. Should I be worried? That seems to be all he's doing. I don't understand kids today. Hey, kiddo. 'Sup, mom. Whatcha doing? Creating an original video game. Well, me, Nate, and Cameron are. Hmm. Sounds like fun... Hon'. Please, don't rhyme, mom. Okay. Logan, will you do my a favor? Go outside, skateboard, get some sunshine, fresh air? Yup, will do. Wow, that looks complicated. Don't forget to wear your helmet. I always do, mom. Yeah. Yeah, I remember Sandra. I didn't know her that well. Well, she had a car sophomore year, and we loved going to garage sales and searching for treasures. I haven't heard you mention her name in years. She lives just over in Madison? Just outside of town. Hmm. Why'd you guys lose touch? She got friendly with a couple of girls, and I felt excluded. Just stupid stuff. No big fight over a boy or anything? No, we just grew apart, separate lives, different towns. 20 minutes away? Yes. I heard she was engaged a few years back, but it didn't work out. And now she's closing her store. Well, don't go crazy buying everything. You're going to have to store it all. And who's going to move it for you? Oh, no. There's just not a lot extra, if we set aside for rent and utilities. Dani, did you take your salary last month? I postponed it. Don't do that. You haven't taken a salary in three months. This is typically our slow period. It'll pick up. Where are we going to get the money to buy Sandra's inventory? Emergency fund? Is this that? It's an opportunity. It could put us in the black. If we buy really great stuff at a good price, and we turn it around quickly. Jenn? Hi. You made it. I'm so glad. Your store is wonderful. Well, who did I learn with? Aw... I've been looking for a Tiffany lamp. I have a client who would buy this in minute, but you should get the sale. We'll talk about it... Oh, look at that brass telescope. Original tripod, 1920s. I love it. And I love your store, but... Honestly, I don't think I could afford to buy half the things in here. Well, I've got a... A plan for that. But first, are you hungry? I thought everything was coming together. My fiance, Michael, was my partner in the store. Business was struggling, but at least we were in love, or so I thought. Oh, no. I woke up one morning, he's already out, and there's a note. Another woman. He's leaving to be with her, I can have his half of the shop. Oh, that's horrible. Yup. They were moving away. "See ya later." We never spoke again. I'm sorry, I wish I would have known. It was tough at first, but not having any contact, it helped me get over it quicker. Then I found Cliff. Ooh. Cliff. Do tell. He's an ophthalmologist, has a practice in San Francisco. Lives in Marin. Oh, Jenn, I'm so ready. Maybe Michael did me a favor. Well, with favors like that... We really should have stayed in touch. I know. Listen, the shop. I know you saw some things you liked. So many things, but, truthfully, it's going to take more money than I have. Maybe not. I don't want to sell it piecemeal. I want to sell it all. Just be done with it. Well, I really can't afford that. Hold on. If you take everything you think you can sell one day, then when you do, just send me 20%. Sandra, you can't be serious. You'd be doing me a favor. It'll be like an ongoing annuity. Oh, I don't know... Jenn... You'd really be helping me out. Please? Okay. Deal. Great. And I can't wait for you to meet Cliff. He'll be here this Friday. You know what, we are having friends over for dinner Friday night. You guys should join us. Hi! Welcome to Rags to Riches. I'm Dani. You're Danielle? Yes, I am. I'm Elena Derosa. You come very highly recommended. Well, thank you, I guess. I own Derosa fine arts. Do you know the gallery? Yes, I know of it. I'm looking for a manager. Oh... Oh. Well, I'm an owner here, so I'm not really looking for something else. Well, you would only be working with exquisite pieces, a high-end clientele, and you'd be making a lot more money. Think about it. Everyone is going crazy these days. Why not go old-school and have him be a kung-fu master? Shaolin trained. Right, but his powers are not supernatural. Cool, and each level, his opponents get stronger... Maybe multiple enemies? And to reach the highest level, he has to fight the illuminati. Okay, bad idea. Cam's thinking of hacking his dad's phone. I just need to see if the school has texted him anything about my grades. I thought you had a 4.0. Had. Nate and me kinda skated last quarter. I don't know about hacking your dad's phone. Well, it's not really a "hack." It's just an app that runs in the background. Yeah, you see, a "hack" would be if we were able to... get into the school computer system and actually change the grades ourselves. That'd be epic, dude. Understatement. Logan, are you in? I'm already getting "A"s. Like, what would I change them to? We'd be legends! Expelled legends. Come on, you guys aren't serious about this, are you? Nah, someone always finds out, right? It'd be cool just to see if we could, though. Dani! You cannot believe the stuff that she has. You cannot believe our books. I'm serious. She has a Tiffany lamp. I already know someone who will buy it. Yeah, I'm serious, too, Jenn. I don't think we'll be able to buy very much. Ah, but here's the best part, we don't have to give her any cash up front. All we have to do is give her a percentage of what we sell. - Really? - Really. It's about time we caught a break. Let's go eat some chocolate. - Okay. - Yeah. I think it's fascinating. You deal with real killers and real crime. Not like in those mystery novels you used to read. Jenn reads mysteries? Obsessively. Well, that explains a few things. Well, it's paid off. She actually has helped us solve a few murders. - Seriously? - What? I-I didn't do that much. No, she's being modest. Yes, she did. She's a natural. Oh, go on. Fortunately, she's back to reading books now. Yes, I am. I'm just reading books. Well, Cliff helped solve a mystery last week with a patient. The eye chart? Oh, right. I had an older patient, who I knew couldn't see very well, but he was reading the eye chart like he was a kid. Perfect vision. I "see" where this is going. Bad... But I couldn't figure it out, whose eyes get better as they age? So, when he wasn't looking... You turned the chart upside down? Exactly! But he was still perfect! That guy was crafty, though. Cliff is so nice. How did you two meet? He came into the shop. Can you believe it? A man who loves antiques. Actually, no. He was looking for a gift. His home is very mid-century modern. Are you sure about this consignment deal? I feel like you're being too generous. I am so sure. Oh, and I can't believe I didn't mention it, I also have a barn filled with even more stuff. A barn? Ooh, I love barns. I know you do. Who wants some pie? Oh, yes! Yes! I forget how funny Frank is when he's not being a detective. Oh, Frank's always being a detective. Hey, did you notice he gave me credit for helping solve those cases in the past? Uh-huh. I especially like the part about it being in the past. Right. Remember when I said I might need some help moving a few things from Sandra's shop? Yes... Well, I was wrong. Oh. It's not a few things. It's all of it. I don't know what she got out there. We're going to need more storage. We need to sell something. OK, next person who comes in is buying. That's the spirit. I'm giving you fair warning, I haven't opened this door in a long time. Don't worry, I won't judge. There might be a few things you want. The rest of it is going away. Wow. I'm going to go get some coffee for us. Have fun. Jenn? I've got coffee! Where are you? Sandra! I'm down here! You've got to come down here and see this. Uh... hold on. What is it? Watch your step. Look. I didn't know this room was even down here. Look at all this. It's great. Look at this painting. The frame alone is worth a lot. This is unbelievable. I don't understand. Why would he do that? Hide all this, and then leave it behind? Michael... I can't believe it. This whole time... I've been living here, and he's been... Right there. I'm so sorry. So, I know this is very hard, but sheriff Connors has a job to do. He just has a few questions to ask. It's all standard procedure. Can't you do it, Frank? It's not my jurisdiction, though he has asked me to consult, so I'll help in any way I can. Are you okay? Yeah. I am okay. I will be back to check on you later. Thanks for coming right out. You've got a knack for this, I can tell you that much. Did you know this guy? Never met him. They're not going to think Sandra had anything to do with this, are they? Well, someone shot him. They were engaged, right? He drops her. Hell hath no fury. There's no way Sandra did this. Well, good, 'cause I don't think so either. But I'm just glad I'm not the one who has to figure it out. Well, keep me posted. Here we go. I've never been down there. I didn't even know there was a room was under the barn. When did you last see him? Two years ago. We were engaged, living here. I got up one morning, and found a note that said he was leaving. He was in love with another woman and was moving away. And you had no contact after that? I didn't want any. You don't believe me. I didn't kill Michael. Why would I send Jenn out there to look around if I knew that my fiance's body was under the barn? Do you still have the note? Maybe. In a box somewhere, I'd have to check. There was another note that I found in his pants pocket about a week before. It was a woman's handwriting. Signed "me." What did the note say? Just, "see you tomorrow - me." I felt ill when I read it. And you have no idea who he was having the affair with? No, and I never got the chance to ask. Do you own a gun? Michael had a gun, but he took it with him when he left. Or... When I thought he left. Hey, um, theoretical question, dad. If you knew someone was doing something that they shouldn't, are you obligated to tell? Does that make you, like, really uncool? Uh, there are worse things than being uncool. Not many. All right, um... Let's say you had a friend who wanted to take a selfie on the top of a moving train? That's a little extreme, but, yeah, I get your point. I'm not going to ask you what this is about. I know you'll do the right thing. Every time. Oh. Hello. Hi, hon'. So, Sandra and I found her ex-fiance, Michael, underneath the barn. He was dead. I'll explain it all later. Looks like we're having pizza tonight. Go in and look around, just like you're a customer. They're not going to believe I'm a customer. Just... Let me know what the place is like, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, you didn't hack this, did you? No, dude. That's just the portal. You wouldn't believe the firewalls and securities they have. You said it, hackers always get caught. Only if someone tells. Digital bread crumbs will lead right back to you. Not always. Me and Nate are cooked if our gpas dive. You sure you don't wanna help? Sorry, you're, uh, you're breaking up. I didn't quite catch that. Okay, man, I'm just saying. And how long would you be grounded for if you got caught? How long would eternity be? Anyways, I gotta book. See ya. If there's anything I can help you with, please don't hesitate to ask. You seem to like this. Do you know what it is? Um... Oil painting? Old? Definitely old. Yes, it is. 19th century. Hudson river school. How much is it? A lot. Is there anything in particular I can help you with? Nah, I was just walking by. Hmm. Well, we're really not open for browsers. I'm sure you understand. Got it. Well, thanks. It's a really nice gallery. Oh... I believe the artist is Thomas Cole. - No... - Yes. Completely dark room, underground like a sealed vault. I wouldn't have even gone down there. There was furniture, and paintings, and all this cool stuff, and then, the body. It was horrible. You're a murder magnet. Yeah. I'm not sure I like that. It's really nice. Kind of snooty, but the paintings are impressive. What are you talking about? I was at the Derosa gallery. I saw a guy there that looked like he stepped right out of GQ. What were you doing there? Um, I asked Hannah to check it out. The owner came in, and I just wanted to see if it was as nice as she said. Well, why send Hannah? Well, 'cause I had things to do around here. Why don't you tell your daughter what you just found? Your mother found a body. It was dead. We've got forensics downstairs. Sheriff, you might want to see this. Looks like the shooter just tossed it aside before heading up the stairs. No khown cause of death until we get the coroner's report. Oh, come on, he was shot. Well, aren't you the mystery buff? In a murder investigation, the obvious... is often quite wrong. Okay, it's unlikely, but the killer could have shot a dead body in an attempt to disguise the actual cause of death, right? We don't even know how long the body was there. The last time Sandra saw him was two years ago. The killer made no effort to hide the weapon, which is odd. Fingerprints? Let's just let the sheriff do his job, okay? There's no mystery here. It's just straightforward police work. Analyze the evidence, interview everybody, and go from there. You're right. Body in the barn! That's our headline, "body in the barn." I thought "corpse in the cellar" would be better, but, you know... Jack Donnally, Daily Journal. You're the Jennifer Shannon listed on the police report. Frank? That's my cue to go. Always nice to see you, Jack. You too, Frank. - Frank... - I just have a few questions. Very photogenic. I'm just going to get a couple more. That's it. Oh, that's good, very good. It really encapsulates that fear that I'm sure you felt when you saw that dead body. Jennifer! Sit down, sit down. Thank you. Always happy to see you. I'd offer you a drink, but it's got to be a stiff one. You're funny. You think so? Did I mention how I might have to leave this place? It's a dead-end job. Ba-dum-bum. Listen, I need some information on Michael Chambers. Ah... He was dead. Yes, he is in residence here. How can I help you? Well, I need to know cause of death, how long he was dead, whatever you can tell me. There will be an official coroner's report, released through the appropriate channels. If I violate that, I could lose my job. You know I've already seen the body. Mm-hmm. It looks like someone shot him in the chest. So you're speculating there might have been three gunshot wounds to the torso? From a small-caliber weapon. Like a 9 mm? Might have happened about two years ago? It would be impossible to pinpoint the exact time of death. Casper's law, a body exposed to air will decompose twice as fast as a body in water. Four times as fast as a body in the ground. Unembalmed, a body in a casket could take up to ten years. This was a sealed room, underground. So, it was probably very cool. No air circulation. No insect activity, no animals. A body might look pretty good after a couple of years. You want to see it? No, once was enough. The autopsy would show if he was already dead before he was shot, right? In a general sense. Usually. Was he? Oh, just answer me one, okay? I can't answer the question. But let me ask you this, did you see any blood stains on his clothing? Yes. Do you think dead people bleed when you shoot them? Hmm? Hey, sweetheart. Hey. Hi. Did you put that lasagna in the oven? Yes. It's almost ready. Great, thank you. Hey, hon', remember when we talked about getting involved with real crimes and with real murderers? About how that's a bad idea? No, I know, but I'm not involved. Ah. Oops. "Jennifer Shannon, "owner of local store Rags to Riches, "made a horrifying discovery today "while searching for antiques... "The dead body of a local man who disappeared two years ago. Shannon, no stranger to murder mysteries..." Listen, it's not my fault. It's not like I go looking for this stuff, it just happens. Dani called me a "murder magnet." Great. What am I supposed to do now, hmm? Look, I'm going to change my clothes and bring that lasagna over to Sandra. Cliff's coming later, but I don't want her to be alone. At least he took a good picture. Hair's a mess. I meant to throw this stuff out. Sheriff Connors wants the note that Michael left behind. It might be in here somewhere. Little did I know. He was in good shape. Yeah, a bit narcissistic. Practically lived at the gym. What I don't understand is the secret cellar with all that stuff in there. And you had no idea that cellar was there? I rarely went into the barn. But now I know why the store was struggling so much right before Michael disappeared. Hmm, with Michael buying all that stuff and squirreling it away in the cellar. You know, about two weeks after Michael disappeared, I was contacted by a baseball card dealer. He thought Michael was still around. He heard that Michael had bought a "shoeless Joe Jackson" rookie card. The dealer wanted to buy it. How much is something like that worth? Well, he was willing to pay about $10,000. But that's 'cause it was worn. A mint one would be worth a fortune. Wow. Yeah. Our business account was almost tapped out. Why didn't you go to the police? What could I prove? I didn't even know where Michael was. And, honestly, I just wanted that part of my life to be over. I think it's strange that the shooter left the gun there. Yeah. It was Michael's. He kept it in the house. The sheriff got a little weird when I told him that. I could see that. You had motive, opportunity, access to the weapon, and the body was found on your property. Well, put like that... Sandra, did you kill Michael? No. Absolutely not. I believe you. But you're going to hear that question a lot. You were engaged, and spouses are always prime suspects. Sandra! Oh, Cliff... Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. Jenn was nice enough to come out. Well, I don't mean to rush off, but I should be getting home. Thanks, Jenn. I'll call you later. Okay. You should be happy your picture was in the newspaper I had two customers come in yesterday just because of it. Did they buy anything? The old jewelry box. $95.00. You looked cute in the paper, by the way. Thank you. Hair all messed up. Thank you. Jenn, I wasn't completely honest about why I sent Hannah to check out the gallery. Oh? The owner, Elena Derosa, wants to talk to me about managing it. Dani, that's great. What a compliment. Art has always been your passion. I told her I'm not interested. Are you sure? Maybe you should at least consider it. Do you want me to? No, I don't. Of course, I don't. But I don't want you to miss out on a great opportunity. It's not an opportunity. It's not? Well, maybe it is. But anyway, I'm not going. So... Can we talk about this later? I have to meet Sandra right now, she's hiring a lawyer. Whoa. Does she need one? Having a lawyer is not a bad idea when your former fiance turns up dead. I can see that. There is no telling. You get an overly zealous prosecutor, and he could try to make a meal out of you. What should I do? Stop talking to the police, unless they charge you with something. Won't that make me look guilty? No, that will make you look smart. Now, what we have to figure out is, if you didn't shoot Michael, in the basement of your barn, with the pistol from your house, because he was leaving you for another woman, who did? I have no idea. Look, if Sandra did this, she had two years to get rid of the body, right? She could have filled the entire cellar in with dirt. And she would have never left those valuable items down there. And the prosecution will argue that it was a crime of passion, and that in the aftermath, Sandra was in such denial, that she would never go down there again, never see what she had done, and if nobody knows it happened, maybe it didn't. Life goes on. Except for Michael. Are you okay? I am. I just... Can't believe this is all happening. I'm going to, um... Head back to the shop, keep my normal routine and keep my mind off this. When is Cliff coming back? He's flying back Friday. He's got surgeries all week. Well, you call me if you need anything, okay? I'm just 20 minutes down the road. Thanks, Jenn. Hang in there. Hi. Welcome to Rags to Riches. I'm Dani. Kim. You buy as well as sell, don't you? Well, that depends. What do you have? Some furniture and... things. This kind of stuff. Antiques. Well, we'd be happy to come and take a look. I'll talk to my partner, and we can give you a call? Is that Jennifer Shannon, the one from the newspaper story? Yes, this is our store. That was just horrible. I can't imagine seeing that. She must have been pretty shook up. Yeah. She's pretty tough. There is my name and address. Great. What time is best for you? Any time is good. I appreciate this. My husband died unexpectedly last year. I'm making a new start elsewhere. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Well, if Dani takes this other job, I don't know if I'll be able to run Rags by myself. Does she want to go? Well... She says she doesn't, but why would she send Hannah to check it out? And the truth is, I want what's best for her. Even if it means closing the shop? I don't know. I mean, Dani deserves everything that comes her way, and... She's always dreamed of being in the art world. How's Sandra holding up? She got a lawyer. They haven't charged her with anything yet, have they? No, but if another suspect doesn't turn up, it's not looking good. It's on Riverview Road. Ooh, very nice. Great old homes. Mm-hmm. And she was just a walk-in? No, she saw your picture in the newspaper. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Why is she selling? Recently widowed. Wants to make a fresh start. Huh. Nice car. Nice house. Hopefully, nice things inside. I appreciate you coming out on such short notice. Oh, well, thank you for having us. You have some lovely pieces. Thank you. I don't know much about them. It was my husband's thing. Yes, we're sorry for your loss. Thank you. It's been almost a year, and I'm just starting to feel better. I'm moving to new Mexico, and none of this would work there. I think it's all pretty old. Well, I would say, at first glance, you're right. Do you mind if I take some pictures? Oh, please, go ahead. And I'm going to take some notes. I read the newspaper story, where it said you had an antique store. I wasn't sure what I was going to do with all this stuff. Is there anything that you want to keep? No. Not really. I just want a fair price. Well, we will look around, and go back to our shop, do a little research, and get back to you with an offer. That would be great. Well, it's all pretty nice stuff... Can we sell it fast? The slant top secretary's desk, I could sell tomorrow. If we paid wholesale, we're talking... $20,000 for everything. We still have the emergency fund. That's 7,000. I might be able to get some deposits off the pictures we took. Why don't we just raise what we can and make an offer? Oh, I hate it when someone says, "make me fair offer." Conscience? Yeah, a terrible thing to have in this business. I might be able to get Jason to give us a bridge-loan. I have some savings. Dani... Why not? I'd get paid back as soon as we sell some of it. We are not going there. And by the way, did you follow up on that job offer from the gallery? No. Well, I think you should. Just test the waters. You're not making a commitment, you're not leaving Rags, but you owe it to yourself to hear what that woman has to say. I just heard from sheriff Connors. Sandra's being arrested this afternoon. Murder. Her fingerprints were on the gun. How am I going to do this? You're going to be okay. What about bail? They have 48 hours to arraign. We'll ask for bail then. She'll get it, right? I mean, she's not a criminal. You've never been arrested, have you? No. Yes, she should get bail. It will be $100,000 at least. You can use your home as collateral. I'm real sorry for this. Do I have to wear the handcuffs? Same rules for everyone. Please turn around and place your hands behind your back. I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Michael Chambers. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney... It's really tough. We tried a DDOS attack, but that didn't work. Back doors are shut tight. Our school district, which can't afford books, has 64-bit encryption! Can you believe that? You guys are crazy to try this. We have to. Grades are out next week, and if we don't fix them, we could mess everything up. Even our college applications. Logan, we need your help. You've got skills. We could all do this together. I don't have those skills. Listen, if the three of us put our heads together, we can do this. Go talk to your teachers, you know, see if they'll give you some extra credit to bring the grades back up. I thought you were our friend, man. Think about it. Let's go. You don't think she actually shot Michael, do you? I don't know. I have no way of knowing at this point. She didn't do this. How do you know that? Gut instinct. Well, then somebody else shot him. Who? Well, find motive, method, opportunity, and you'll find your killer. This isn't a mystery book, Jenn. This is the real world, and the clock is ticking. Sandra... Oh, geez, are you okay? I've seen worse. On TV. Good one. Listen, Sandra, we need to learn as much as we can about Michael's life. Try to figure out who the other woman was, who his friends were. I have no idea who the woman was. Just the note, signed "me." After he left, I scooped up everything, and I threw it in those boxes. Okay, you said he liked to go to the gym a lot. What gym? Iron fitness. And as for friends, he was pretty much a loner. You know, he just liked to work out a lot, shop for the store. At least that's what I thought he was doing. You mentioned something about baseball cards, somebody calling after Michael left, wanting to buy them? Right. I don't know what happened to them. But they're easily transportable. You could sell them in any card shop in the country. They're like cash. Excuse me, I'm looking for Mandy? Oh, the blonde, thank you. Awesome job. We'll see you next week. Mandy? Yeah? Oh, you must be Jenn. Hi. Thank you for taking the time to see me. Well, I remember Michael, and when I saw the newspaper, I couldn't believe it. I thought he had just moved away. What do you remember about Michael? He was a work-out animal, always at the gym. Did you consider him a friend? I just knew him from here, that's all. What did other people think of him? Was he popular? Not really. He had a roving eye, that's for sure. You know when a guy is always checking you out, and he thinks it's a compliment? Was he romantically involved with anyone at the gym? That was the rumor. She was a member, and one of our trainers, Duane, was seeing her, and he got jealous. He and Michael got into an argument in the parking lot, and someone saw it, and said that he threatened to break Michael's neck, and he got suspended. Do you know the name of this woman? No, not off hand. It's weird, because I heard Michael was engaged at the time. What's Duane's last name? Lambeer. If you talk with him, watch it, he's pretty combustible. Could be the steroids. They only allow him to work with members who request him. Can you tell me the next time he's here? I can check. Thank you. I was impressed by your art background. Mm. I'm an artist myself. Oh. Here, you're a bridge between the artists we represent and the customers. So, have you been managing the gallery yourself? At times. My last manager ended up marrying a client. Occupational hazard, I suppose. Well, um, I'm very flattered that you thought of me, and you have a lovely gallery... Danielle, I don't want a "yes" or "no" from you today. I just want you to think about it. You would be in charge of the gallery. There is some traveling involved. Locally? Once a year, you would have to travel to Paris and London for the auctions, sometimes elsewhere, to represent clients. Wow. That is definitely something worth thinking about. You speak French, don't you? Yes. Oui, bien sur, je parle francais. I'd have to do some brushing up. You'd be surprised how fast it comes back to you. Okay, why do you think someone killed him? I think he owed money to someone, and they wanted to get paid. Or maybe he had something that the killer wanted. Most robberies don't end in murder. Yeah, well, some do. Whoa. When did family dinner become murder 101? Don't look at me. Eat your broccoli. How was school today? Great. My criminology class... You're taking criminology? Elective. Anyway, everybody was talking about the "body in the barn," and my professor was saying that if you just look at the statistics, the killer is probably a man. That's interesting. Why? First off, 90% of homicides are committed by men, and a gun is the most common weapon. Big deal. That means 10% are committed by women. And how do they do it? Still guns, but less so. Knives come in second. I love the potatoes, honey. Can I... Get some more? Oh. Logan's right, the killer could have easily been a woman. I know Sandra is your friend and all, but what if she's guilty? Oh, I am confident that she's not. Well, what if you're helping a criminal? Luckily, in this country, you are innocent until proven guilty. So, I'm going with innocent. Delicious. I don't like it sweety. You keep telling me not to worry but it the fact that I do worry. I know. Sandra's been charged with the murder I don't think she committed. I can't just stand by and hope she doesn't get convicted. Can I? I hope. I guess not. Well, I love you. I love you. Good night. So, Kim Balmain how old would you say she is? 30s? And did you see the picture of her husband? Mm-hmm. Robert. He looked a little older. Maybe 50s? I don't know, still pretty young to be dropping dead. I found this article online. Said he was out hiking, had an allergic reaction, and died. While hiking? That's horrible... And then Kim became a wealthy young widow. Jenn... Sometimes, in the real world, people just die, without being murdered. They get hit by cars, or have heart attacks, get stung by bees, and that's it. Fini. Hmm. Anyway, I've got some leads for Sandra. There's a trainer at the gym where Michael used to go. They got into a fight over a girl. Not Sandra? Nope. That is a good lead. Good, good, good. Now go finish up with some cardio. Excuse me, Duane? Hi. Hi. Do you have a moment? Yeah. First things first, let me say this, you're in pretty good shape for a woman your age. Now, I mean that. Okay, actually, I'm here to just help a friend. Did you know Michael Chambers? Yeah, a total jerk. A dead one now. I saw the newspaper story. Well, I... I heard that he might be romantically involved with someone from the club, and I was wondering if you might know who that would be? I don't know you, and I don't know anything about Michael Chambers, except someone did us all a favor. So, whatever you're doing, I don't want any part of it, understand? For real? You guys got into the system? Almost there. It's hard work, though. If you helped, man, it would be a lot easier. I'm not that good. Yeah, you are. You know, there could be an upside if we get caught. I hear the CIA is hiring hackers. With high school diplomas, which you won't have if you get caught. Excuse me, I was interested in buying my husband a special birthday present. Do you sell old baseball cards? Whatever you want, I can get. Even something really rare? That's why I'm here. We don't carry them in stock, of course. Where do they come from? Collectors are always buying and selling back channel. "Back channel," what does that mean? Under the radar. A private transaction between private individuals, it's, uh, you know... Private. Oh, so you're kind of a go-between? Yeah, kinda. For a fee. Well... Here's what I had in mind. You want one of these? My husband is a fan. How much would a shoeless Joe cost? The prices in the book are all over the place. Well, a shoeless Joe rookie went for a quarter million at auction last year. Oh, my goodness, I had no idea. I mean, that, of course, is for a pristine example. A worn, discolored card would be worth a lot less. Wow. That's cute. Would you take $75.00 for it? Nah, I gotta have a hundred. That's probably worth a lot more, you know. It's, um... Art greco. Great, I'll... I'll take it. Um, let me know if you hear about any shoeless Joe Jackson cards, on the lower end, of course. Thank you. Mm-hmm. The trainer's name? Duane Lambeer. He threatened to kill Michael. Argument was over a woman. Her name? I don't know. She worked out at the club, could have been a client of Duane's. This is pretty thin. Well, it's a start. Oh, and there could have been a money motive, too. It seems that Michael purchased a rare and valuable baseball card shortly before his death. Sandra doesn't know where it is. She's never even seen it. How valuable? Enough to kill. Hey, Frank. Oh, hey, thanks for coming down. Okay, arraignment is tomorrow. I talked to the prosecutor, and he is very confident this will go to trial. What about bail? We'll know tomorrow. Oh, I almost forgot. Sandra wanted me to give this to you. It's the letter that Michael left. "Sandra, "I'm in love with someone else. "Whatever is in the store, "you can have. "I'm going away. It's better like this. "Please don't try to contact or find me. "I am only following my heart. Michael." This doesn't really help, does it? Actually, it does. At least this part of her story is true. It helps with her credibility. Okay, here's a copy of the crime scene photos and the autopsy report you asked for. Thanks. I'll let you know if anything comes up. Okay, very good. All right, well, I'd better get back to work, too. Thanks, Frank. I don't even know how you can go through all of this stuff. What are you hoping to learn from a coroner's report? Somebody shot him. Well, you don't know until you read it. Okay, let's talk this through, okay? Assuming Sandra didn't kill him, suspects and motives, go. First, Michael is a thief. He's stealing from Sandra. He's skimming off profits from their shop, and he is buying collectible baseball cards with a lot of cash. So, maybe the thief got killed by another thief? Okay, a possibility. Second, there's a love triangle. Everyone assumes it's Sandra because Michael left her, but I just met a guy who is half-psycho, who threatened to kill Michael over another woman. Duane the trainer. Yes. And he may be the only person who knows who the other woman is. And if he didn't kill Michael, he probably knows who did. See, I just can't get my head around Sandra's fingerprints on the gun. How did they get there? What? Where are you going? To get an answer. I don't think I've slept at all? I feel like everything is stacked against me. No, not everything. Arraignment's in the morning, and there's a good chance you'll make bail. Sandra, I have to ask you something. Why are your fingerprints on the gun? Because I shot it. Not at Michael. But at the range. Michael and I used to go out there. I'm probably the last one to use it. Well then, why aren't the killer's fingerprints on the gun? He must have worn gloves. The killer knew where the gun was kept in the house, and he also knew about the hidden cellar, which you didn't know about. And he had to know that Michael was planning on leaving. No one would miss him, or even look for him. Yes! You look intense. Gaming? I've just done the impossible. I hacked into the school's computer system. What? What in the world would you do that for? Do you know how much trouble you could get into? No, I'm not changing my grades. I'm changing Nate's and Cameron's. They gave themselves "A"s when they were going to get "C" s. Look. The grades are out tomorrow, and they think it's a done deal, but I am changing them back. Why are you doing this? I don't want my friends to get caught cheating. That's funny, they think they're cheating, but you're reversing the cheat. Exactly. They're going to get what they earned. Instant Karma. Yeah, that too. You're a good kid, Logan. It's so obvious... Why wouldn't her fingerprints be on the gun? Wouldn't Michael's be there, too? There were partials, but the last person to handle the gun without gloves was Sandra. The killer had to know they had a gun and where they kept it. Could Michael have brought the gun to the cellar? But then he would have left complete prints over Sandra's, right? Unless he wore gloves. Hmm, and the killer wore gloves, too? I'm not buying it. I have a mystery that I'd like to solve. I saved my chocolate cake from last night, and now it's gone. Jason... You think I would eat your cake? In a heartbeat. Well, you shouldn't have left it out where I could see it. So, it's my fault you ate my cake? Your cake is still there. It's behind the milk. But I get half. What? No... Jenn. Jenn? This waiting is driving me crazy. Could you have gone? Mcguire said it could be an all-day affair. He had no idea when Sandra's case would come up. Oh, my goodness. Well, either you made bail or you escaped. Escaped. Mcguire was great. He convinced the judge that if I was going to disappear, I already had two years to do it. What's next? Well, the evidence goes before a grand jury, and then they make the decision as to a trial. Time frame? It's up to them. Might be a week. For now, all I want to do is go home and have a shower. I hear you. I'll come by later and fill you in on a couple of things. Okay. That's nice. It's art deco. You know, we almost bought something like that a couple years back, but Michael said it was over-priced. I'll see you soon. These are good leads. Why won't the sheriff investigate? They're working to make a case against Sandra, not prove her innocence. Fine. Follow them up, but stay out of trouble. All right, I have the info you asked for. What does this have to do with Sandra? Long shot, a woman called us to sell us some antiques after the newspaper story came out. She was very interested in Michael's death. I thought that was odd. I also thought it was odd that she her glass on an antique coffee table. Robert Balmain, 55 years-old, was a private investor, married to Kimberly Balmain. Accidental death, last August, hiking on Silver Fork trail. Cause of death, anaphylactic shock. He ate a power bar that contained peanuts. It says right here. "Remains of a partially eaten bar were found with him." So, murder by power bar? It would be if someone knowingly put that bar in his bag. Look, I go by my hunches, and I have a hunch about Robert Balmain. Oh, this should be good. My hunch is that whoever killed Robert Balmain might have killed Michael. If you're right about this, I'll buy you lunch for a month. But you're buying today. Power bar... I don't know what you said the other day, but it really set him off. I asked about Michael Chambers. Well, he went into the locker room, and he broke a big mirror with a trash can. He's been banned. Oh, guess I pushed a button. Do you recall a member named Kim Balmain? Could she be the woman that Michael and Duane were arguing about? There was a member back then named Kim... Kim Collette. She was stunning. I know I hacked the system, and I know I changed them. I saw them. They were all "A" s. But now I got "C" s. What happened? Well, are you sure you guys coded the change? Yeah, everything looked good. We're toast. At least you didn't get caught. True, that. I mean, at first it was exciting to break in, but then... I kind of wished we hadn't. I didn't sleep at all last night. Me too. I bet you slept. Like a baby. Should've listened to him. Less stress. Whoa, I've got an idea. What if we told the school how to break into their system. We could be, like, cyber-security advisors. Maybe that's something you'd be down with? County registrar will have all the marriage licenses. How is it spelled? Uh, Balmain, b-a-l-m-a-i-n, Robert. Got it. A little less than two years ago, Robert Balmain marries Kimberly Collette. The woman from the health club. But how does this connect to Michael? I have a couple of theories, the first one is a love triangle. There's a trainer at the gym, Duane Lambeer. He got into a fight with Michael over another woman. That woman was Kimberly Collette. Maybe, when Duane heard that Michael was moving away with Kim... He snaps, confronts Michael in the barn, and then kills him? I had detective Lynwood run a background check on Duane. He's been in jail twice, both times for assault. So, how would he know about the secret cellar under the barn? Let's say he came out here to confront Michael. He sees him go into the barn. He follows him in and down to the cellar. They argue, they fight... But why is the gun there? I don't know. Michael would have had to bring it. What's your other theory? My other theory is the baseball cards. They're worth a lot of money, enough money for someone to kill over. Maybe someone was going to buy them from Michael, and they decided to steal them instead. So, Michael has the guy come out, takes him down to the cellar where he keeps the cards. Michael is nervous about the whole thing, so he brings the gun with him. But why aren't Michael's fingerprints on the gun? Ah, it turns out that fingerprints on a pistol can only be taken from a smooth, flat surface. If Michael held the gun by the pistol-grip, which is checkered plastic, he might not have left fingerprints. So, who is the killer? Don't know. Yet. I did find a guy who deals with this baseball card stuff. Pretty sleazy. And I... Found the other note. I don't even know if it's from the woman that Michael was seeing. I just know my heart sank when I read it. "See you tomorrow. Me." What's that tell you? I think your instincts are right. Seems pretty intimate to sign the note "me." Hello. Yes, this is Jennifer. Yes, I am still interested. Can I call you back to confirm? Thank you. That was Billy the card broker. Someone surfaced with a shoeless Joe rookie card for sale, and a few others to go with it. We can meet the guy tomorrow at Billy's shop. I know you're still on the fence. Danielle, this is so frustrating. I'm offering you an opportunity. I know. You're a diamond in the rough. There's so much I can teach you. About art? Presentation. First off, clothes. While the clothing you wear might be acceptable at a thrift shop like Rags to Riches... We're not a thrift shop. My point is, that to deal with our clientele, you need to present yourself with class and elegance, and I can help you with that. There's also a fringe benefit I didn't mention. We deal with a lot of wealthy men, some of them single. Do you really want to make a career out of that shop? Working with Jennifer, who's... Very sweet, but, quite Frankly, somewhat common... Oh. I think I know what you're saying. Let me make it simple, do you want to dance in the barn with hay on the floor, or come to an elegant ball at the chateau? Probably the barn. I like line dancing. And if Jenn is there, I know I'll have a good time. She's my best friend. Thanks for the offer, Elena. I'm going to stay at Rags. And lunch is on me. Au revoir. Honey, I want to show you something, see what you think. Okay. Take a look at this. This is a photo the police took after the body was removed. Now, here's a photo, pretty much the same angle, that I took later. What do you see? Honestly, they look the same to me. Look right here, next to the candelabra in the crime scene photo. The little statue is not in the photo that I took, but it's in the police photo. That means somebody had to go down there and take that statue after the murder. Okay, someone removed the statue. Whoever took the statue could very well be the killer. Okay... I bought that statue the day before yesterday. What? Where? A guy who brokers baseball cards had it in his shop, and get this, he knows someone who has a shoeless Joe rookie card for sale. I think the broker bought the statue from the same guy who killed Michael for the cards, and now wants to sell them. Honey, if this is true, I want you nowhere near this. Oh, I know. I'm already getting Frank involved. There's a meeting set for tomorrow. You go only if he goes. I promise. Don't worry. What do you think? Well, I want to find out who Billy Carr acquired this statue from. Well, whoever it is was in the cellar. Why? Well, if that person is connected to a baseball card that once belonged to Michael, this could get pretty interesting. Sandra's on her way here now. Okay. I'm going to be in the store before you guys, posing as a customer. Now, another customer is going to come in shortly after you, that's one of my guys. You got that? Got it. Are you okay? You can stay here. No, I'm fine. The customer after us is plainclothes. Frank is already inside. Why do I feel like you've done this before? Let's go. Is that the guy? No, that's a customer. And the party in question is not a guy, it's a woman. She just texted and said she's not going to make it. A woman? What's her name? Diana. She said Diana Dors. That's not a real name, that's an old movie star. You think anybody in this business uses their real name? Frank... Nobody's coming. Hey, Billy, got a closed sign for this dump? Somebody walked in off the street with the statue. I paid cash. This is tied to a murder, Billy, and right now, it's looking like you're in pretty deep. For buying a statue? Michael Chambers had a shoeless Joe rookie, and that card just vanished when Michael was murdered, and now, suddenly, you know someone who wants to sell one? I want their phone number, Billy. I don't have it. It was a blocked call. And you just... Just happen to have a little bronze statue that was taken from the crime scene? I told you the truth. Okay. Michael was skimming from his fiancee's store and buying rare baseball cards from you. He ends up buying a very expensive Joe Jackson rookie card, and he doesn't pay you. You're furious, so you go to his place, you follow him into the barn. There's an argument, maybe a fight... And then you get your hands on a gun. You shoot Michael, you take the baseball cards, and, as an added bonus, you grab the little statue on your way out. Now, what part of that isn't true? All of it! None of it is true! I don't want to talk anymore, I want a lawyer. I can't believe they didn't just arrest him. Well, Frank was just trying to scare him into talking. He doesn't think Billy is the killer, but he could lead us there. Hey, did we sell anything today? Five sales. That's a good day. That's a good day. I'm hitting the farmer's market. Do you want anything? No, I'm good. Okay. "See you tomorrow... Me." Oh. If you need any help, just let me know. Here we go. Interesting. I wanted some tea. You're going to make a phone call. Sandra, I was just going to call you. You will not believe what I discovered. Tell me when I see you. I need you out here right away. Something's come up. I've gotta go. Please hurry. If your friend doesn't screw things up, everything will be fine. You've reached detective Frank Lynwood. Please leave a message. Hey, Frank, trying you again. I'm on my way out to Sandra's. Something's going on, I don't know what, but she sounds stressed. Call me back, and if I don't answer, there's a problem. Sandra? Sandra? Are you okay? Put your cell phone on the table next to hers. I've already called detective Lynwood. He knows everything. Well, then I have nothing to lose. But you might be bluffing. So, I think it's time for me to move on. You never planned on going anywhere with Michael. Nope. You thought he had some valuable baseball cards and antiques. You knew about the hiding cellar under the barn. You met him there and you shot him with his own gun. Almost. The cards weren't worth as much as he said. If he hadn't have lied about the cards, he'd still be alive today. How did you know he would have the gun with him? I didn't. Can't you figure that one out? Oh... You took the gun from the house. You knew where it was because you'd been in the house. Yup. Romantic afternoons while Sandra was at work. You kill Michael in his own hiding place. The body may or may not be discovered, but there's no way to connect you to the crime because you wore gloves. You think like a criminal. And you'd get away with a baseball card collection that you thought was worth a fortune. Still worth something, but not the fortune I needed. And then you marry Robert Balmain, fully intending on killing him. Makes me, what? A black widow, a creature that kills its mate? Trap door, please. Let it go, Jennifer. Gun versus pipe, who wins? Down the stairs. What are you going to do? Tie you up so I can make a safe getaway. I'll make an anonymous call to the cops in the morning. Now, go, before I change my mind. Duane was never a part of this. Nope. I guess I led him on, but what else is new? Michael was flirting at the gym, we started seeing each other. He told me he was leaving Sandra. We started having secret dates. Sorry about this, but it beats the alternative. You told Billy you wanted to sell the rookie card, but that wasn't true. You're right, I had no intention of selling the card. I wanted to smoke you out. I was standing across the street, waiting to see who would show up at the shop. So, what's the next move in your twisted little plan? By this time tomorrow, I am going to be sipping a mai tai, checking out married men at the bar, a long way from here. Oh. Can't forget my insurance. Ta-ta, ladies. Jenn... I have an idea. Hold on, Sandra. I smell smoke. She's burning the barn! I know, I know. Hurry. Try to pull your arm out. Here we go. Come on. No! We'll never get out this way. Some of the floorboards are pretty old... Gotcha! Here. Oh. Sandra! Right here, help me. Together. Oh! Hurry, hurry. Reach! Go! Are you okay? Yes. My phone is in the house. Hands over your head! Sheriff's department! Let me see your hands! Don't move! This card belongs to you. It'll be used for evidence in Kim's trial, but other than that, it's yours. I don't know if I even want it. I'll take it. I know a broker named Billy. Tomorrow morning, the charges against you, of course, will be dropped. So, Kim is looking at..? Two murders, Michael, and her husband, Richard. And attempted murder of Jenn and Sandra. Attempted murder? I'm sorry, honey, but she locked us in the cellar, and we had to break out. I called Frank before we went over there. Oh, okay, if you called Frank that makes it good... Well, to Jennifer. I will second that. You've got a real nose for this. No, don't encourage her. Yeah, no, don't. This was a little too close for comfort tonight. But credit where credit is due. Thank you. But for now, I am going back to being a wife, mother, and garage sale diva. Yeah, right. Sure, mom. That, I will drink to. I'm just grateful you solved this mystery. Ah... To Jenn. Cheers! Cheers! She shoots Michael for a baseball card she thinks is worth a fortune. But it's not. How did Billy get the statue from the cellar? He snuck in late night after he read the newspaper article. He thought the card might be there, but it wasn't. He grabbed the statue, hoping it would worth something. So Billy had nothing to do with it? Nope. How did Kim know Sandra's fingerprints would be on the gun? She didn't. She got lucky. The only thing she was concerned about was making sure that her fingerprints weren't on the gun. Then she marries Robert... Fully intending to kill him. She's a bad one. She really set fire to the barn with you and Sandra in the cellar? I would have had to run this place all by myself. You turned down the gallery job? You're stuck with me, for better or worse. What happened? Creative differences. She didn't like your clothes. - What? - Don't ask. Let's map out Saturday's garage sales. Good idea. Oh! "The most interesting garage sale in the world." Hmm! Oh, check this one out, "items purchase themselves." We can do better. I found it! "Uncover the mystery of hidden treasures." Oh, here we go.
