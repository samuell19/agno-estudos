It dropped below 25 cents? And? W, what happened? Yeah. What? A major investor sold off? Sold off? Dear... what's wrong? Jesus. - It took a dive. - What? We're finished. Done for. - What should we do? - Crashed. What're you doing? Mariko! Hurry! Mariko! Let go. Let go! Let me die. Let me die! Dad! Don't be stupid! - Let go! - Stop it! What's going on, Mom? Dad! I can't go on. Dad! Come on, buck up! I have no choice. Dad! Dad! Why? I have to return the money by the end of this month. That's it? Not much to die over. Don't be gutless. Sort things out! - Mom! - It's 200,000 dollars! Dad! Dear! Dad, pull yourself together. You could ask them to wait a bit longer. I'm known as a tough buyer one buyout after another. I made that reputation on trades. How could someone like me beg my competitors for a favor? Beg as much as it takes! It's better than dying! But... Uchiyama is merciless when it comes to money. - He's cruel. - He's still human, let's ask him. Let's give it a try! Chin up, Dad. I'll quit school and start working. It's okay, we'll start from scratch. Dad! Mighty Ken's broke, huh? What do you want to ask me? I must tell you that the loan's still due this month, got it? About that Mr. Uchiyama, I need more time. Have you forgotten what you said? "Loan plus interest within the month," "I'm Ken the Trader, I'll stake my life on it." You remember? Mr. Uchiyama, I'm ashamed but here I am, I'm begging you. You've conned your business partner. - What? - That's right. Show me you're a man and keep your word. The end of this month, and not one day later. Mr. Uchiyama. We understand the deadline. But he's so ashamed of what happened. Last night he tried to hang himself! Leaving the debt and dying? How selfish! Mr. Uchiyama, considering his current state, could we have six more months? Ma'am, your husband is quite a speculator. Couldn't he pull together such a small sum? Of course we tried a few places but he's not much of a popular figure with anybody. Without your help, the whole family might as well die! Please, Mr. Uchiyama. Come on, Dear. You are our only hope. If there's anything at all we could do. Mr. Sakata. I might extend your loan. What? Really? - Lend me your wife. - Huh? Then I'll consider it. What do you mean? If you lend me her body. What? Don't be ridiculous! A sacrifice from you, too. That's not asking so much, is it? Shame on you! I've not fallen so low that I would sell my wife! Okay, fine. Then no deal. Dear... He's making a fool of us. If my body could be of some use. Ridiculous! Think of Mariko. I don't care about us, but Mariko. No! Is there any other way? Mr. Uchiyama, if you'll have me. Fine. Get yourself ready. - In here? - Yeah. With your husband next door. Stop it, please stop. I can't... I can't... I can tell you had some fun, too. Right? Pays to bargain, I guess. We're done now, right? About the deal. I'll give you six months, but is that enough time? Think he'll be on his feet? Doesn't seem like it to me, does it? He says he'll find a way. What kind of crazy people would lend money to a broke stock-trader? Right? Listen to me. Just pay me the interest for the time being. What's the catch? Well, it's my son. My son, he's a bit crazy. Poor kid, he's never been with a woman. No, thank you. Just once. Pair up with him once, will you? - No, I won't. - I beg you. Fine! Three years for the loan! And interest-free for 12 months! Come on, please? You've already slept with me. What difference will it make? Just once, yeah? I beg you, please? Here... This way. Come. Come inside. Don't worry. Hiroshi. Hiroshi? One look at Itaro from Itako and you knew he was a cruel wanderer... Hiroshi? Hiroshi? Are you warm enough? Yeah? That's good. There you go, that's a good boy. Yeah? Okay, okay. - I'm going home! - Ma'am, he's a good kid. He got good grades at school. He was just a bit shy. - Help him, please? - Sorry, but... Come on, Ma'am. Help him, please? I'm begging you. Please. I'll leave you to it. Hello, Sakata residence. What? The police? Yes, that's my mother. What, dead? She's dead? What? What happened? - Dad, you idiot! - What happened? Mom died, they said she died! Died? Died? Run over by a car. It's your fault! You killed her! You idiot! Idiot! Dad? What's wrong? Come on, Dad! Are you okay? Dad? What's going on? Dad, Dad. Dad! You okay? Dad, I'm going to make big money. I'll get revenge on Uchiyama. I'll avenge mother's death! Mark my word. - Hey, lend me 30 dollars? - No way. You've got 100 loan already. Maybe next week. Machiko, join me for dinner? You paying? You kidding? You all get paid, too. I'll pass, then. Mariko? I gotta get home. You all gotta get home, huh? I got it. New boyfriend, huh? Bet that's it. Oh, well. Oh, Mariko, here's 3 days' pay. Thanks. - See you. - Thanks. Such a weird girl. She's a total cheapskate. She won't hang out if it costs any money. Saving up her money, huh? Yeah. She even takes home the cigarette butts. Like a beggar! Two bread rolls for dinner. 15 cents each, that's 30 cents. Come on, lend me a bit? Just 20 is fine. My brother costs me a lot as I'm paying his university fee. Your brother, huh? Aren't you really bankrolling your pathetic boyfriend? You got me wrong. - I'm telling you I'm a virgin! - Ha! You can't even find one in kindergarten. Wanna check? Not for a loan. That's a different issue. I've never even been kissed. Oh yeah? It's true, - you are a novice. - See? Hey, let's move over there. You're gonna like this. You've got such lovely skin, Aki. So nice. How's that, good? I'm home. - Welcome back. - Still awake? It's very late... you must be tired. No. I'm sorry... I'm making you do all this. I was so stupid. Forgive me. Don't apologize, it won't change a thing. I guess so. But... I'm Ken the Trader who's well known around this area. And now I'm being looked after by my daughter. Stop with that. Thank you. Welcome. Oh, over here. Please don't come to work. But I haven't heard a word from you since you moved. I was still settling in. Welcome, what can I get you? - Coffee. - Sure. Well, I'd like you to settle up, you know? This is a business, when will you pay? I still can't say. Interest is piling up, you want to pay with your body, eh? That's ridiculous. I'll get back to you soon. Here you are. If you can't pay, you know what to do. And pay this bill, too! What is it, Manager? You're so sexy. My boy's all excited. Stop with that talk. I mean, I want you to be my girl. - Understand? - No! Let me go! No! No! Quiet down, come on. Forgive me! For what? - Don't be shy. - No. No, let me go! Somebody, anybody... Help! Let me go! No one's here. Stealing my man? You slut! Best timing ever to barge in... I'm home. Hey, Dad, what's the best way for a woman to make money? I wanna throw that loan in Uchiyama's face. Dad, are you sleeping? Dad... Dad? Oh, Dad! No, Dad! Dad! Last will Mariko, you'll be better off without me. I don't have anything else to say. Just that my death ends the debt to Uchiyama. Work out the details with a lawyer. If there's anything left, buy as much Star Drug stock as you can. That's all. Please don't... don't smoke in bed If you love me... put it out Close your eyes Sweet dreams A scent of Chanel... and a gentle sigh Awaits you... again tonight. Ah, I slept so well. - Morning! - Good morning. You're up so early. You work hard, I'm impressed. Maybe a bit too hard? You know, if you're after money you could sleep with the guys. For business and pleasure. I get $50 an hour just saying "Ooh, aah." I wish I could be as frank, but I'm not that cheap. What? Talk about cheap! These earn you 5 cents an hour. Some nerve to talk about cheap. Hey. You've been flirting around? Just been busy, that's all You hired a maid? Said she'd work for a place to sleep. You're moving up. It feels nice, hiring someone. I bet. She here? No, she went shopping. Oh, her? Hey... - No time. - It's fine, we've got 15 minutes. - A quicky, then? - Yeah. Stock Market News Quiet, she'll hear us. Who cares about her? She's so stupid, thinks it's wrong to have sex for money. We could make some money off her. Well... She says she's a virgin, but maybe not. They won't even care. Just try to fake one, right? Stop talking about her for now, will you? Now I'm... about to... Mariko, I heard you're saving money. There are better ways to do it, you know? There's a show coming up. A private party for famous rich people. Pays 1,000 dollars. What? 1,000? Yeah, a thousand. I'm in, how's it work? This skin's worth 3,000 dollars, huh? Dad, forgive me. Do you know what I'm going to do? Giving that Uchiyama the same fate as you. My virginity gets in the way. So I sold it for a premium. Virgin... skin untouched by any man. Pure, untainted skin. You okay? I think I can do it. - With your help. - Good, nothing to worry about. Make as much as you can, it's fun. Yeah? Hey, you, I'm Murase. I've got an invitation. Over that way. Oh, okay. - Hello. - Hello. - Oh, Mr. Iida. - You, too? I got a strange invitation. Me, too. - Look. - I see. The gang's all here. - The same invitation? - Yeah. "I request your presence for an important discussion..." I don't get it. No idea at all. - All five are here? - Yes. - Follow me. - Okay. Shall we? You... You sent it? I have a good relation with your son, Isao. - A sexual relationship with him, - You what? as well as the rest of you here. Mariko, is this some kind of joke? It's not a joke. I made detailed record of my sexual relations with each of you. I'd like you to buy them. Are you blackmailing us? Some nerve! Out of your depth! Who'd believe an article from you? Who do you think we are? Stop making a fool of yourself! This is a nasty stunt. - We can sue you! - Absurd! - Let's go. - Hold on! I'd like to show you something. Every single detail of my relations with you were recorded. Damn, Mariko. Hey, turn that off! Oh, this is bad. Jesus... This is a problem. Stop it! - Stop this, please! - Stop it now! The stock's up, the film's sold. One guy said he'd pay $50,000. How stupid! And? I sold it! For that money, wouldn't you? Idiot! You promised them you'll burn the film. You crazy? $50,000! Sold to a yakuza. I can buy more stock. Haven't you made enough? Not yet! I'm gonna make more. Wake up! What if you get caught, huh? I'll buy more and more. And I'll crush Uchiyama. I must crush him with stocks! Dad, I'm going to slap your loan back in his face! Here we go, Hiroshi, supper time. There, supper, it's good. Are you hungry? I bet you are. Here we go. Look, here. Poor thing. You want a girl, don't you? I'll get you one soon. Just wait, yeah? Okay, Hiroshi? Hey, what's wrong, huh? Okay, I got it. Hiroshi? What is it, today, huh? Calm down, will you? What's wrong? Calm down. Hey, Hiroshi! Okay, I got it. I know, I know. One look at Itaro from Itako and you knew he was a cruel wanderer... Hiroshi, what are you doing! Okay, I got it, Hiroshi. One look at Itaro... Hey, Hiroshi! What're you... it's me! Hey, no, stop, stop. Hiroshi, stop that! Look, look! Careful, hey... Ow... one look at... ouch! Ow, ow, ow! Hiroshi, not there, that's my...
