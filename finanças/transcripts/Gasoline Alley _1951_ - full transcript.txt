Once upon a time, about 1920, to narrow it down a bit, there was a quiet little street in the suburbs of one of our great cities. But it was the alley behind the street that got most of the attention from the folks who lived on the block. Gasoline Alley they called it. Because every warm summer evening back in those happy 20s, the men in the neighborhood got out to tinker with their cars. There were some fine automobiles on the block. There was Doc, with his shiny new car and Avery with his car. And Uncle Walt Wallet. The outstanding thing about Walt, the main thing that is, was that he was a fine man. Honest, upstanding, friendly and a bachelor. Yes sir, an incorrigible, dyed in the wool bachelor. Then one rainy night, something very strange happened, to a bachelor, of all men. That was how Skeezix came into Uncle Walt's life. Not long after that, he had a wife. Her name was Phyllis, but everyone called her Auntie Blossom. So that was the end of Walt the bachelor, and the beginning of Walter Wallet, the husband and father. Because in due time, Walt and Phyllis had two children of their own. A boy. And a girl. Well the years passed as the years will. Skeezix fought in the war, came through all right and settled down with his wife, Nina, to raise a family of his own. Walt's boy Corky grew up and went away to college. Little Judy grew up, too, and joined the high school band. In case you haven't guessed, she decided to play the trombone. That one struck a nerve. Judy! Judy! Yes mother? Better get at your homework. Okay mom. Algebra. You know, I'm a little concerned about Judy. She doesn't seem to have any interest in school but boys and the band. She'll get over the band phase of it. Yes. I wanna do my homework down here so Pop can help me if I get stuck. Glad to Judy. Okay, I'm stuck. American government. Under what circumstances can the Senate prevent an attempt to filibuster? Well. That's a pretty difficult question. Pop you've gotta concentrate. You flunked my last test. Well. Anybody home? Hi everybody! Hi Mom, Dad. - Hi. Hi Judy. - Hi Judy. Hi Skeez. Pop does the senate- - Glad to see ya son. How are things down at the shop? Oh fine, we're thinkin' about putting on another man. Good, glad to hear it. Hey Skeez, under what circumstances can the Senate prevent an attempt to filibuster? Well, Judy, the Senate can buy a two thirds majority vote, invoke the cloture rule, thereby limiting debate to one hour and all points of order are then decided by the chair with that debate. That's my brother that said that. Hiya Mom. Corky, why aren't you in college? I got a surprise for ya. Folks, this is Hope, and we're married! Married? No! Yippee. Love marches on! So I said, "Hope, let's get married." And she said, "Well I'm game if you are." And I was. So we did. Well didn't you tell her folks either? Oh yeah, we sent them a telegram. We thought we'd surprise you. You did. And you quit college. You didn't have to do that. Lots of students are married. Oh no mom, I'm a married man now and I'm gonna support my wife. Let's face it, I wasn't doing so hot in college anyway. As Dad knows. Yes I know. But you see Corky, the competition for the good jobs gets keener all the time. A man needs a college education. Pop's right Corky. It isn't only the degree. It's the contacts you make. They last a lifetime. You'll stay here, of course. Well only until we can find a place of our own. Well, of course. Let's see, we can clear out his old room. That's awfully small for two people, Walt. Judy, you know- I'll go quietly officer. Aw, no. - Judy, don't. Hey I'm kidding, it's a good deal. I get a brand new sister-in-law for my old bedroom. Gee, Corky, I'm glad. If you'd waited 'til you graduate, you might not have snagged me such a pretty one. That's all of it, I guess. Good night, Corky. Good night, Hope. - Good night, hun. Good night, sis, and thanks a lot. Well honey, that's the family. How do you like 'em? Oh they're fine, Corky. Only, did they have to keep poundin' on that stuff about how much a college education means? They only want what's best for you, Corky. I suppose so. But they just won't give a fella credit for growin' up. Did you notice the way Skeez and Pop talked to me, like they would to a kid? Oh you're so touchy. You're right I am. You know why? No. I'll tell ya. You see, Hope, all my life I've been a kid brother. As a youngster, I got Skeezix's hand-me-downs. He had first on everything. I was born into the situation, and I didn't mind it. Not until later when I began to notice things. Everything Skeezick's ever turned his hand to, he did well. School, jobs, even the army. Why, he's a wonderful guy. But don't you see how tough he is for me to follow? There's only one answer. I've gotta make good. I'm gonna be somebody all right but it's gonna be on my own, strictly. All right, you may as well tell me about it. I was thinkin' about Corky. Thinking or worrying? Thinking. You know, it was inconsiderate of him, to say the least, to burst in on us with a brand new bride. Oh it isn't so terrible. It may be the best thing in the world for him. Well I hope so. But so many of these impulsive marriages don't last. They're undertaken lightly and they break up the same way. Now, Walt. What concerns me is the pattern. He's always done rash, spur of the moment things like this and I suppose he'll continue to do so. Oh, now. Anyway, I want him to have a job where I can keep an eye on him. Guide him if necessary. I'm gonna ask Mr. Whicker to make a place for him down at our office. All right, if you think it's best. Feel better now? Yes I do. Well then, for Heaven sake's go to bed. Yes, mother. Thanks, mother. Mornin' mom, mornin' dad. Good morning Judy. - Corky and Hope up yet? I got 'em up, they'll be right down. Morning, folks. Hi, son. Hello, dear. - Have a cup of coffee. No thanks. Ah come on. Well, all right. Dad, I did a little thinkin' last night. About Corky? Yeah. You know there's two ways at looking at this situation, we can let Corky dig up his own job and find out things the hard way or we can help him. He's a good kid. All he has to do is grow up a little. I hate to see him get his ears pinned back before he's ready to face things. My idea exactly. So I'm gonna take him into my shop. I can teach him- Wait a minute, I was gonna talk to Mr. Whicker about him this morning. No dad, my shop's the place. He's not gonna get me in wrong with the boss because I'm the boss. Well, I don't like the inference on just a hired- Morning, Cork. Judy. - Hello, Corky. Morning, Skeez. Hi, mom. Good morning. - Good morning, Hope. Sit down, Corky. Your favorite breakfast, waffles and bacon. No thanks mama, I gotta get goin'. Bye honey. Cork, if you heard something you didn't like, I'm sorry. All I can say is, we wanna help you all we can. Well thanks a lot, Skeez, but why make a big production out of it? I can find my own job. Corky, please have some breakfast. No thanks, Mom. I'm not hungry. I beg your pardon. Am I right to assume that you came in answer to the Apex Novelty Company ad? Well yes. How very fortunate I ran into you. I was just on my way to a conference. Mister? Mister? Wallet. Mr. Wallet, I like your look, sir. Thanks. And I think you have what it takes to make a top notch salesman. Thanks. Now I have what is, without a doubt, one of the finest products of its kind in the world today. A combination apple corer, bottle opener, peach pitter and paring knife. A fast seller at a mere dollar and 40 cents. The cost for you is only 80 cents, the rest is pure profit. Now all you have to do is purchase this handy little demonstration kit for the full sum of 10 bucks. Nice try. Come on, my boy, we're waiting. We've got a whole catalog to get out. Mrs. Finch, Mr. Wallet. How do you do? Slippers, my boy, slippers. Now, first pose. Try it. And smile, mother, a little. There we go. Chin up. Good, good. And what's the copy on this one Mr. Upton? Ah the copy, look at the reinforced construction, Mother, I have perfect freedom of action. Right. Snap it, Sam. Mr. Edgard, Mr. Wallet. How do you do? Finch. We'll make this one, "I have worn them for over 40 years, son, and they've never let me down." Snap it Sam. Ms. Rice, Mr. Wallet. How do you do, Ms. Rice? Carol's the name, honey. Mr. Wallet, hands on hips please. The copy is, "I like Dix's athletic shorts unis, they give 'til it doesn't hurt." That's good! Thank you Ms. Ent. Snap it, Sam. Hiya Carol, you all through for today? That's what the man said. Got a job for tomorrow? No, I don't. Mr. Upton said he wouldn't need me. This was your first job, wasn't it? Yeah it was. Did the green show much? Not too badly. You'll do all right. You're a perfect junior. A junior? Well, a collegiate too. That's better. Corky, believe it or not, there are other studios. Give me your phone number. I'll call you if I hear of anything. Oh gee, Carol, that'd really be swell. I'd appreciate it. There. Then again, maybe I'll just call you. There you are, Wallet. Thank you sir. Mr. Upton. - Yes? Could I please have some of those pictures I was in? Oh, I guess so. The proof's are comin' off now. Pick up a few copies on the way out. Thank you very much, sir. I've worn them for over 40 years, son, and they've never let me down. Say, what kind of a job is this anyway? I got 15$ for an afternoon's work. Part of an afternoon. Is that bad? But where's the future in it? Making your living prancing around in your BVD's. Corky, these pictures are printed in catalogs. They go to our friends, our neighbors. It's like appearing in public in your underwear. Say, who's the dish? That's Carol, uh Ms. Rice! Ms. Rice? Did you have to smile at her like that? Hope, dear, they make you smile. If you don't, they shoot it all over again. Maybe my eyesight is bad but it seems to me you aren't smiling in these other pictures. You had to do that too, I suppose? Well of course I did, I got paid to. Nice work, if you can get it. Well, look at the way she's staring at you. Nobody can make a girl look at you like that. Oh Hope, listen! Darling, all I'm trying to do is earn a few dollars so we can have a place of our own. This modeling, it's just like being an actor. A guy and a girl might play a love scene but it wouldn't mean a thing. Well then, this Carol, you don't wanna put your arms around her? Of course I don't, honey. I just wanna put my arms around you. Of all the silly work, modeling underwear. I've worn this here underwear now for 40 years, son, don't you think it's time I changed? Notice the reinforced construction, mother, it's cut off the circulation in my left leg. Some job. He passed up a chance to work for Whicker and Company. He's so young, Walt. When Skeezix was his age, he was a sergeant in the army. He had 30 men under him. If he'd been a little flighty when he came back, I could've understood it but there's no excuse for Corky. No excuse except that he's a human being. And human beings are all different. Don't expect him to be just like Skeezix and you won't be disappointed. He's a fine boy and you'll be proud of him someday. Now get to bed. Yes, mother. Now who in the world? Hello? Hello? Is Corky Wallet there, please? Just a moment. It's for you. Who is it? Some girl. Hello? Oh hello, Carol. How are ya? Who? That was my mother. Yes, I live at home. Oh sure, sure I will, Carol. Yeah, thanks for calling. Well, for goodness sakes, I said I'd call you, didn't I? Why don't you give me a ring sometime? Sure. Sure I will. Okay Carol. Yeah, bye. Hope, open up the door. No! Please, honey, it's cold out here. No! Hope, I don't even have my slippers on, I could get pneumonia, you know? You can't come in unless you promise to quit that modeling job. I will not! Nobody's gonna tell me what kind of work I can do. Pop, I've decided to give up modeling. Good. I thought it over last night and you're right, there's no future in it. Glad to hear it. Mind? Well, here we go again. Help wanted male. Corky, there's a firm down in our building that has a job open. Would you care to go down and look into it? Well, I sure would, Pop, thanks a lot. Well fine, you finish your breakfast, I'll get the car out. Okay. Bye bye sweets. Bye dear. Corky, if you get this job, I certainly hope you'll stick with it. I must admit I've been a little concerned about ya lately. Ah, don't worry about it, Pop. I may try 20 jobs before I find one I like. 20 jobs? Oh a rolling stone gathers no moss, you know? Who wants moss growin' on 'em? I intend to keep moving fast enough to prevent it. Oh I know, but you'll never get ahead like that. Hey wait. Look at that, Pop. Well, it's a restaurant. Sure. Hey I'm gonna go see what it is, will ya wait for me? But. Good morning, officer. I was just looking for a restaurant. Hey, Pop, how much does that job in your building pay? 35 dollars a week, I understand. I guess I'll take this one. 40 bucks for 40 hours and two meals a day. Corky, what kind of work is this? Dishwasher. Dish! Ah no Corky, that's no job for a college man. Ex-college man. Besides dad, maybe this'll be one of the 20. Anyway, thanks for the lift. I said I'd be right back in. Dishwasher. Pudge. This is Corky Wallet, your new dishwasher. Hiya Pudge! Ah, nevermind the hand shakin'. Let's see some action with that pile of crockery. I said wash 'em, not smash 'em! Hi Skeez, hi Ana! Who's sitting with Chipper and Clovia tonight? The Peterson boy. Larry? Dream boat's babysitting? I have to walk over and help him out after a while. Judy, you have your homework to do. I'll take it along. Yeah but will ya do it? Shut up. Judy! It's nice to have you home to dinner for a change. How were things at the restaurant today? Oh just fine, mom. I'm developing a system. Saves a lot of time. A system? For washing dishes? Yeah that's right. You know there's more to dish washing than you think. I'm sure there is. Now take the scraping, that's the most important part. If people cleaned off their plates, it would make dish washing 50% easier. All the food that people waste. You oughta see our garbage can. Corky, please. I'm sorry, Skeez. You've been working at that restaurant job three weeks now. Don't you think it's time you made a move to something with more of a future to it? Well, Pop, we're puttin' a little money away each week. And, you know, it's not a bad idea to have a little cash to fall back on in case I do make a move. Well, I had a talk with Mr. Whicker a couple of days ago and he's willing to make a place for ya down at our office. You wouldn't need anything to fall back on if you made that move. It's a real opportunity, Corky, somethin' with a future. I wish ya'd take it. Well, thanks a lot, Pop, but if I went with Whicker and Company, I'd have to stay whether I liked it or not. And I don't wanna be tied down like that, not just yet. All right Corky. When you're cookin' greens, you don't add anymore water than you need to keep 'em from burnin'. Then you add a pint of strychnine, and just a tiny pinch of DDT, and a teaspoon full of gear grease, got it? Huh? Oh yeah, a pinch of DDT and a... I'm sorry, Pudge. All right, what's eatin' ya? My dad doesn't think there's any future in the restaurant business. He's right. Well, then what are you in it for? I like to eat. Ever hear of a cook starvin' to death? You got a point there. Hiya Pudge! Joe! Joe Allen, how ya been? Swell, wonderful. Corky, I want you to meet an old army sidekick of mine. Corky Wallet, Joe Allen. How are ya? Corky? Hey, I like that name. It's got character. Thanks, Joe. Hey, Pudge, I ran across somethin' today you might be very interested in. Yeah, what? A diner. You could get it for cheap. Good location. Good location? How come it's on the market? Because the guy that runs it, is a lazy good-for-nothin' character with a personality like a warthog and he's behind in his rent. You oughta grab it, Pudge. No. I owned a lunchroom once. When I feel like gettin' up and goin', I wanna get up and go. Hey, who owns this diner? An old codger by name of Pettit. And he's so tight, he squeaks. You know, that sounds like a good deal. I'd like to take a look at it. How do ya like that? Three weeks as a dish washer and he's ready to lick the restaurant racket. Maybe he's got a good garbage connection. Well, there it is. Oh brother, a coat of paint sure wouldn't hurt it. Might help hold it together. Joe wasn't kiddin'. It's a good location. Sure. Hey, Pops said he'd meet us here at 2:00. If he likes this setup, he'll fix it for me to get some financing. Hey while we wait, you wanna go in and take a look around? What do we got to lose? Our appetites. What'll ya have? Coffee. Coffee. Oh, just coffee? Just coffee. Hey, uh, would you mind wipin' the counter off? Nevermind, you'll get the rag dirty. Wow. This is coffee? I never tasted varnish like that, and I was in the army too. No, no, no, don't drink it. It'll eat the enamel right off of your teeth. Hi, son. Hiya, Pop. Pop, I want you to meet Pudge Mackay, the best cook that ever opened a can of beans. Sarge! Pudge! You old horse thief, you still make a livin' poisoning people? Sergeant Wallet. Where you been keepin' yourself? Gee, you're lookin' great! Are you Corky's brother? Sure! Pudge was the mess sergeant in our old outfit. We fought the doggone war together. That we did, fought the war and the MP's and the second of Louise! Yes sir, Sergeant Wallet! Funny, I never connected the name. Greatest sergeant we ever had. Hey kid, you got quite a guy for a brother, you know that don't ya? I know. So Pudge, what do ya think of the place? Well, it's a good location. Plenty of speed traffic for the drop and trade. Nice parking lot in the back. Looks a little empty. Well if you ever saw the inside, you'd know why. Nobody in his right mind would go there twice. All it needs is a good cleanin' up from stem to stern, fresh paint, some new equipment and smart up and add a management. And that's where I come in. Well, Pop, how bout it? Well, when a place gets as run down as this, I'm afraid it's impossible to save it. Oh Corky, I'm sorry but this proposition doesn't look good to me. Well, I guess that's that. Well now wait a minute, Corky. Pudge, how do you feel about it? Sarge, I'm not the kind of a guy to get tied down to anything but if I was, I'd go for this. Well if Corky goes into this thing, would you go to work for him? I haven't been asked. Well I'm askin' ya! Sure, I would. Well that's good enough for me, Pop. Okay, Corky, I'll back ya. How much money will ya need? Skeez ya mean it? Sure I mean it! Well, we figured about 600 bucks. Things always cost a little more than you think. Make it 1000, that'll give ya a reserve for emergencies. Ah Skeez! I'll sign a note for ya at the bank. Ah, gee, that's really swell. Only there's one thing. Remember, this is business strictly. You're in it because it's a good deal and you can expect a little profit, right? Right. No family stuff. We'll handle it just the same as if we were strangers. All right, stranger. When do ya wanna get down to the bank? Ah gee, tomorrow's plenty soon enough. Before I do anything, I gotta find out if I can get the lease. Hey, will ya give me a lift downtown? Sure. Oh Pudge if I get you to go to work for Corky, maybe I'll see you once in a while, huh? You sure will. You know five years is a long time. This calls for a celebration. That it does, that it does! Well on the way downtown we'll stop somewhere for a cup of coffee. Coffee? Sergeant, you're a disgrace to the old outfit. Come on let's go. Well, this is it. Old man Pettit's den. Thanks for the lift, Skeez. Wait a minute, Corky. Are you sure you wanna go through with this? Oh yes I am. Well I was just curious so I had my secretary look up some figures. Do you know out of every 100 restaurants that start a year, 54 will have changed hands or have gone out of business by the end of that year? And 80 by the send of the second? Well, I aim to be one of the 20 that survive. You better survive, Cork, I'm bettin' 1000 bucks on ya. Don't give it a second thought. Stick with me and you'll be wearin' diamonds. I gotta go see a man about a lease. Hey and by the way, Skeez, for bein' such a good egg, you get the first Corky burger. November of 1949. November. Oh yeah. Well that lease has eight months more to run. Well, I might be interested in the place. Yeah? What makes you think it's available? When was the last time your tenant paid his rent? Oh. How old are ya? I'm 20. Can't sign a lease with a minor. Who's backin' ya? My brother is. Well, if we made a deal, the lease would have to be in his name. Any experience in the restaurant business? Yes, sir. Do you know that in this state 54% of all new restaurants go out of business or change hands before the first year is over? And only 20% survive the second year? Yes, I know. Well I might take a chance on ya. I'll draw up a lease and take effect if and when the present tenant is evicted. $100 a month. Oh? I understand the present rent is $70. $100 a month. I see. Well, it's certainly nice to have met ya, Mr. Pettit, and I hope your tenant pays his rent. Just a minute! 85. All right, 70. Won't hardly pay the taxes. Five year lease. You are to attend to all the details connected with the eviction of the present tenant. And he'll make ya trouble, mark my word. Well, Pudge, we're in business! Sign, sealed and delivered. Good! Corky, I want you to meet Myrtle, she's a waitress at the Silver Star Cafe. How do ya do? How do you do, Myrtle? You aint gonna have any trouble evictin' what's his name. Why not? Myrtle here used to work for him. Didn't you, Myrtle? Yeah, the crumb. He still owes me for two days pay. Of all the chiseling, low down- Myrtle, save it for him. Wait right here, we'll call ya. More coffee, I suppose. No thanks, I just had my stomach re-lined. A wise guy. Come here. You owe four months rent. Are you gonna pay it? It's none of your business. Oh yes it is. This is Mr. Wallet, the new operator of this joint. The new operator? That's right. Now, are you gonna be a nice guy and give him possession quietly? Or are you gonna be a heel and try to make trouble? Well I'll- To help ya make up your mind, here's $50. That's if you give me immediate possession. Look, bud, you're off your rocker. I'll take 200. $50. Take it or leave it. Don't make me laugh. I wouldn't think of it. Myrtle, come in a minute, will ya? Myrtle? Yeah. Myrtle. Hello, Myrtle. Gee, Myrtle, you're lookin' fine. Shut up, ya worm. Where's the 30 bucks you owe me? I'll get it, I'll get it. You just gotta trust me. Ha. $50. If you pay Myrtle, you'll have 20 left. If you don't pay me, you won't have no teeth left. How 'bout it? 20 bucks or no teeth? All right, give me the 20. You guys think you're smart, don't ya? You're gonna make a big thing outta this joint? In a pig's eye you are. Do you know the percentage of new restaurants that fail in one year? 54%. Yeah. And at the end of the second year. Only 20%'ll be alive and kickin'. And we'll be one of 'em. All right mister, you got your 20 bucks, what's detaining ya? Hey, Pudge, it's all ours! Dirt and all! Hey, Corky, what's goin' on over there? Looks like they're buildin' a fence or somethin'. In our parking lot? Hey, they can't do that. Hey, who ordered this work done? A man named Sims. Yeah Harold W. Sims. Yeah, well, Mr. Harold W. Sims certainly made a big mistake. 'Cause my landlord has an understanding with the owner about usin' this lot. So play it smart, mister. Work slow for the next half hour because you're gonna be takin' all this stuff right outta here again. Nobody can do this to me. 360, 370, 380, 390, 400. Well there ya are, Mr. Sims, $400. Thank you, Wallet. And you've got a good deal there. Six months, option to buy with full use of the property during that period. I'll never know how you talked me into it for this kind of money. Well, it's purely a matter of necessity, Mr. Sims. Rock bottom necessity. You see, this kind of money is all I can spare. I see. Well, good luck to you. Thank you, sir. Carpenter 52.80. Paint, 29. Kitchen equipment, 86.10. That leaves us a bank balance of about 40 bucks. You know it's a darn lucky thing we're opening tomorrow. This dough won't hold out much longer. You know that 400 bucks for that parking lot really drew blood. You're not fooling. Now, anyway you don't have to worry about payin' me 'til you get that balance built up. Thanks, Pudge. Hey I can sorta stall off the waitress too seein' that she's my wife. Hiya Pudge. Hiya Joe. Hello Corky. Hi Joe. Hey by the way Joe, thanks a million for the tip about this place. Here we are. Yeah. I never thought I'd see this joint so clean. Look, I don't want any favors because I powered ya onto this beanery, but how 'bout a job? Well Joe, I- Joe's a good worker. But. Go ahead and tell him. He's been very unfortunate in business. First, he opened up a grocery store, then he opened up a shoe store and he did all right. But he ran into big trouble when he opened up a bank. The alarm went off. Well, figures. He spent enough time in the pokey to get a college education, if it had been a college, right? You're doin' very good. Joe has a heart of gold, but his fingers itch for things that don't belong to him. Why, he could lift your wallet without you feelin' a thing. It's a good thing I've got mine buttoned down. I just do that for fun, honest. I haven't snitched anything for keeps for over three years. Look, everybody says a fella should go straight but I got canned from my last job the minute they found out that I had done time. So I ask ya, how could a fella go straight if he can't make a livin'? You know, Joe, that's a darn good question. Okay you're on. Combination busboy, handyman, swamper and dish washer. And you better be good 'cause when it comes to washin' dishes, I'm the guy that knows all the answers. Thank you, Corky. Mr. Wallet. Thanks Joe. Hope, are you thrilled about going to work in the diner tomorrow? Yes I am, Nina. Hi Cork. Hi everybody. Hi Corky. Hello son. Boy oh boy, what a day. Hey that's quite a hand. You allowed to have that many ace's? Hey! All set for tomorrow Corky? Yeah Pop, all set and rearin' to go. Good. - Hey, I hired another man. Oh? Oh Skeez you might know him. He's an old army sidekick of Pudge's. His name's Joe Allen. Joe Allen? Didn't Pudge tell ya? He's got a police record. Oh yeah I know but he's on the level now. Ah Corky, that's what they all say. Well, do you think you're justified in taking a chance? He might put your business on the rocks before you even get started. Joe Allen. Gee, the things he could do with a pair of dice. Well, I didn't hire him to shoot craps with. I just want him to wash dishes. Yes, but do I have to remind ya it's Skeezick's money you're risking? Why not let the man go and play it safe? No, Pop. I just happen to think Joe will be okay if he gets a chance to earn a living. Okay. Well, baby, we've got a big day tomorrow. Good night everybody. Goodnight. - Goodnight son. Goodnight kids. I think it's your turn honey. - Yes. Well I suppose that somewhere in the world there's a more stubborn character than Corky. But I must admit I don't know where. Well folks, we're off. Somebody bust a box of Coca-Cola over my head. I'm ready! - Hey and here he comes! Customer number one! Good morning sir, good morning you have the honor of being our first customer! How about some nice fresh- Wait a minute. I'm here to collect the license fee for you jukebox. It'll be $8 please. $8. Hey Pudge, what's eight from 40? Used to be 32. Still is. There ya are. Thank you. Sure. Hey another one, another one. Good morning, sir. Good morning, won't you sit down? Right here, right here. We're featuring our club breakfast- How 'bout some eggs? Two eggs, scrambled, fried, anyway you like 'em. What'll ya have? Can I have two nickels for a dime? A dime. Two nickels. Well, Pudge, at least we broke even on that one. Yeah. Hello, Max? Yeah I know it's early, so what? Listen, I'll take 50 on the nose on Seabreeze in the fourth and give me 50 on Black Hickory in the sixth. Yeah that makes a dollar I owe ya. Right. Hey here comes another one. And I hope he's hungry. Go ahead, Pudge. Good morning, sir, good morning. Won't you sit down right here? How would ya like to try our deluxe waffle special? Fresh country eggs. Would you like to start off with some orange juice? Tomato juice, any kind of juice. All kinds. City license. For lunch room, restaurants and eating establishments. $50 a year. $50? Payable quarterly. Well then that's 12.50 now. Plus 12.50 for delinquency from previous quarter. That's 25. Hey Pudge, what's 25 from 32? Ah, don't tell me. Bureaucracy. That burns me up. Hey, look who's talkin' like a millionaire? There you go sir, $25. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh good morning, Mr. Wallet. All right, what are you collecting for? I paid my juke box tax, I paid my restaurant tax. Now come on, tell me what's your racket? Yeah, how about the air we breathe? You're gonna tax us for that too? You oughta be ashamed of yourself. Believe me, bud, they got better guys than you doin' time. I'm sorry, all I wanted was a bowl of cereal. A bowl of cereal! Oh well that's different. Won't you sit down? We'll have you fixed up in a jiffy time! Well Pudge, now we're really in business! Hope, you haven't had much time to get hip to this waitress racket. Do you mind if I give you a few pointers? No, go right ahead. All right, look. In the morning when you hand a guy a menu, ask him, "Coffee now, sir?" Believe me, some guys ain't fit for human company until they've had their slug of java. And smile. You're a pretty kid, show those choppers. Look let me show ya, huh? All right. Good morning sir, coffee now? You see what I mean? Yeah. So he wants his coffee and he wants his waffles and he wants his bacon. So you give it to him, like this. Here we are. Lovely morning isn't it, sir? The choppers, you see the choppers? Give 'em the personality. All right, now he ate, the final treatment. Watch. Ready? I'm glad you enjoyed your waffles, sir. That'll be 60 cents. Out of five? One, two, three, four, five. Thank you. Oh thank you! What was it, a big tip? He said I was very pretty. Okay? Okay. Now you practice it. Hey, you know, this isn't good. Where are all the customers? I can't understand it. Maybe the sign's too small. Corky, there aren't any cars passing by. Hey she's right. I wonder what's stoppin' 'em. Hey Pudge, come on. You men take a break 'til the ditcher gets here. Morning. Is this gonna take long? I wouldn't know, mister. Yeah, well who would know? Speak to the super over there. It looks like some kind of construction clan baits. There's some men sitting out on the curb. If we could only- Joe, get me a pot of coffee! Now fry me some hamburgers quick! And lots of onions! Fat lotta help he was. Three to six weeks. Oh what's the difference? One week is enough to sink us. Won't Skeezix give ya a little more money? This isn't your fault. Well, he already gave me more than I asked for, so's I'd have enough for emergencies. How can I touch him for more? Listen Cork, I got a little dough. Oh let's go! Let's go in it! Hey Hope, what happened? Well we advertised. A little more coffee, please, honey. All right. Hey Joe, how about the hamburger? Somebody get that ham and eggs? Do I have to wait a week for it. Coffee now, sir? Don't rush me baby. Oh I'm sorry. Don't go away. We're awfully busy. Ah let 'em wait. What's your name, beautiful? Hope. Hope, you're a cute kid. If you play your cards right, I might buy ya an ice cream soda or something. New dish, huh? Let's go, the ditcher's here! All right fellas! Thank you! 15. 35. 35. 65, 66, 67, 68. Ah, that was a 10. You're right. 77, 78, 79. That's about $81 for the day. Not bad. We're rich. Oh sure. Hey Pudge what's our daily nut? 66 bucks, isn't it? Including the payroll, the rent and the food but without the bank payment. Yeah that leaves about 15 bucks for me. And the bank takes a good chunk of that. Well that's the way it is when you're in business. A lot of money goes through your hands but not much of it sticks to 'em. Do I get to keep all of this? She did all right. How much did you make in tips? I don't know but it's awful heavy. Now I'll tell ya what, honey, you take the profits and I'll keep the tips. It's all yours kid, you earned it. Thanks Pudge. And I'll get this to the bank first thing in the morning. You know we've gotta start building up a balance to meet that bank payment. It's due on the second. Doesn't give you much time, does it? It's gonna be tight but I think we'll make it thanks to those construction boys. A nice bunch of guys. Nice appetites. Hey come on, let's get outta here. It's already 11:00. Hope. Honey. Oh good morning, coffee now sir? It's you. Corky, I'm tired. I know you are, baby. Come on, we're goin' home. Oh! How they doin' out there? Fine. You'd never know they were as green as grass three weeks ago. They're swell kids. Hey today's the second. What about the bank payment? Relax, Corky mailed the check yesterday. I'm sure glad of that. I don't want anything to happen to this setup. Boy, it's perfect. Free food. No cops. Do you have to spoil it? Oh miss- I say Mr. Wallet. Speak up man, what do ya want? A bowl of cereal and a glass of milk. Bowl of cereal and a glass of milk! Comin' up with the cereal and milk! Mr. Wallet? Hope, miss me honey? No. Always rushing away. I can order, can't I? I'll have ham and scrambled eggs. Listen, honey, you wanna talk nice to me. You know, there's somethin' goin' on you might wanna hear about. Like what, for instance? Oh, like this place not bein' here much longer, for instance. And don't ask me any questions, honey, I can't answer 'em. Please. No foolin', it's confidential stuff. Say how bout some coffee! I'll be right back. Ham and scramble too. Hey, Hope, what's the big idea? I guess he's hungry. That's not what I meant. What'd you mean this place isn't going to be here? Look, honey, I told you not to ask me any questions. How would you like to work in a big modern place? Classy trade, none of these roughnecks like this? That'd be wonderful, but where? Right here. There ya go, sir. I'm terribly sorry. Here, I'll wipe it up. Give me that! What's the matter with that guy? He's, well, peculiar. He certainly is. Look honey, you wanna know all about this thing don't ya? Why, yes. Well, how about tonight? What time ya get off? Well I- Oh here he comes again. I didn't order any pie. Oh didn't ya? That's too bad 'cause I'd like for ya to have it. No thank you. How much do I owe you for this delicious breakfast? No charge, you didn't eat a thing. Thanks. That's for you honey, I'll call ya later. Honey? Now listen here, Hope! All right boys, let's go. The whistle blew. 28. Well? We're doin' a land off this business. I'll wait 'til the street job is finished before I'd made him an offer. - How much are they grossing? 80 to $100 a day. That's not bad. Are they building up any regular patronage? Not a bit. Just these construction roughnecks. Well, I'd hate to lose the time and the contractors are anxious to get going. Are you sure it'd pay us to wait? Oh yeah, definitely. Well, keep your eyes open. And keep that big mouth of yours shut. Oh sure, boss. You know as a matter of fact, there's a cute little waitress in there, a real nice little kid. She's kinda crazy about me. Well, she'd tell me anything I wanna know. Well I hope she tells you something I want to know. Corky, you are the most stubborn, jealous man I ever knew! Oh I am, am I? The guy comes smoochin' around right under my nose. What am I supposed to do? Relax and enjoy it? Well, if you'd only listen! I don't have to listen. I saw it, didn't I? - But he told me something. Yeah, sweet and low. I saw that too. All right, I won't tell you. Good! I won't speak to you again, ever! Good! Hey kids, this fightin's no good. Tell him what the man said. Yeah, go ahead and tell him, Hope. I'm not speaking to Corky. I can tell you though. He asked me to go out with him. Oh he did! And what did- Ask her what she said? What did you say? I didn't. He said he'd call me. Ask her why she didn't tell the man she was married instead of flirtin' around the way she did! Corky Wallet, I wasn't! I suppose Mr. Wallet would like me to carry a sign or something. "I am married. Danger. Keep away." Well you coulda told him, you know! I don't care to discuss it! I'm going home! Oh miss, miss! Oh I'd like to- Some other time please. Please I would like to talk to someone, if they could ever- Look, mister, go sit down and eat your cereal. We got troubles. Certainly. Well, we've missed you. It's nice you were able to come home for dinner tonight. I hope you like our food as well as your own. Chilly isn't it? Now see here, you two. I'll get it. Hello? Yes. Who's this? This is Carol Rice. Carol? Oh hello, Carol. Corky told us all about you. I'm Corky's sister. Sure, he's here. Just a moment, please. Corky, it's for you. Hello? Oh hi Carol, how are ya? Oh I'm fine. Yeah, fine. How's the modeling business? That's good. All right, so you've got a better job. Why didn't you give me a ring? Don't you wanna talk to me? Oh why sure I do, Carol. Well you know I do. Honest, no foolin'. Hey well look. Hey look Carol, I'll talk to ya. Thanks for callin', bye. I'm gonna have a talk with them. No Pop, lay off. I think it's working. What's working? Why do you suppose Carol called? Well you adolescent mada hari. Hope, open up this door! No! I wanna talk to ya. Well, go ahead and talk. I can't stop you. I'm not gonna yell through this door. All right. Stay right there. Now, go ahead and talk. Hope, now listen, can I help it if that girl calls me? Well, of course you can. Does she know you're married? No. Well, why not? Why didn't you tell her? Well what do you want me to do? Hang a sign around my neck? Uh huh. Ah Hope. Honest Corky, you didn't encourage that girl? Honest, cross my heart. And hey, how about that guy? Well I tried to tell you. He said the diner is going to be torn down or something. What? So, naturally, I tried to find out all I could. Only you had to come along and serve him his breakfast. I wish I'da served him that pie now. So do I. Oh Corky you're such a stubborn ox. Golly, honey, it's fun to make up isn't it? Let's have a big fight once a week. If it's that Carol again I'll tell her a thing or two. Hello? Hello baby, guess who? It's him. Harry Dorsey. - Oh lover boy, let me. No, no, no, no, no. Hello, Mr. Dorsey. How'd you get my number? That's easy, honey. I'm a smart operator. Oh I see. Well, you were going to tell me something very important. Oh that. I bet you tell that to all the girls. I don't know why an important man like you bothers with a poor little girl like me, that's all. Ah you know why, because you're about the cutest little doll I've seen in many a day. Anybody ever tell you that before? Yeah. Me. Well listen, what about the job we talked about? The one at the new place? Oh that, well I'll tell ya all about it when I pick ya up. Pick me up? Well all right, Harry, 1468 Amster Street. Goodbye, Harry! Oh no, I won't- Corky, we'll make it a double date. I won't stand for- What? Well, I'll be safe enough if you're along, won't I? Well you're darn right you will but, well, who will I take? Oh yeah, I forgot. What about Judy? She's getting more grown up everyday! It's gonna take a few more days. Carol? It's awfully nice of you to bring my brother and Carol along. Yeah, Mr. Dorsey, thanks a lot. Well, after that deluxe service at the diner, how could I refuse? Carol, please. You weren't so bashful at the studio. Well, hello. Well, where should we go? Let's go somewhere where we can dance. - I know, let's go to the beach. Hey, that's not a bad idea. What'd you have to go and bring them along for? Sorry, I thought you'd like it. No, I don't. Aw, gee baby I wanted to be alone with you. Come on, Corky, I wanna talk to you. Hey what's a matter with that guy? Carol's a nice dish. He won't even give her a tumble. Oh he's uh- Oh yeah you told me. He's peculiar. Well, I'm glad we're alone at last, baby. Corky, isn't it beautiful here? Yeah it sure is. The moonlight and everything. That's all, brother, nothing like this ever happened to me before. Oh Carol look, I'm sorry, really I am. It's just that I'm a little worried about Hope, that's all. Corky, be your age. Look, girls will be girls. Is that bad? Hope, darling. Harry, what about the new job? Job? Oh for Pete's sake. You promised to tell me. Do we have to talk about it now? You promised. All right, I work for a large drive-in organization. We're gonna buy that sight and build on it, that's all. But you can't. We have a lease! Okay sweetheart, so you have a lease. Who has a lease? You know the boss, the man. You said we. Oh, did I? Yes you did, what did you mean? I wonder where Corky went! Now what kind of monkey business is this? Corky! Corky! Oh Corky look out! For this he's got energy. Go on, get him, Corky! Go on, hit him in the face! Look out, Corky! You leave my Corky alone! Let me at him, I'll beat his brains out! Corky, he's a spy for a drive-in! Oh, a snooper, huh? Hey, what is all this? Carol, meet Mrs. Wallet. Boy, am I stupid. You double crossing little- All right, so you found out. Well it won't do ya any good 'cause we're gonna lower the boom on you and there's nothing you can do about it. Well, this is the first time in my life a man was more interested in his wife than he was in me. Hey, Mr. Dorsey, wait for me! Oh, you're full of sand. Corky, we're gonna have to walk home. Yeah I know. I don't care, do you? Uh uh. What did he mean lower the boom? What can he do? I don't know, Pudge, he didn't say. Oh I wish I'd have been there. He'da had more than sand in his face. And he'da said- Here he comes. Wallet. This is Mr. Hacker of the Paper Griffin Company. PNG Drive-Ins. And Mr. Dorsey of the same firm. We've met. - We've met. Sit down. Oh, thank you. I don't believe in beating around the bush, Mr. Wallet. So I'll get right to the point. We want this site for one of our drive-in restaurants. Yes I know. Oh you do? Well, we'll give you $2,000 for your lease. Well, that's not a very good offer Mr. Hacker. We've put a lot of money and a lot of hard work into this place. Look at it, it's spotless. It doesn't matter to us whether it's clean or dirty because we're gonna tear it down anyway. We're gonna level off this whole area, pave it and erect one of the most modern types of drive-ins. Yeah well I'm gonna save ya all that trouble. I won't sell! You'd better sell, young man! Mr. Hacker has made me a very generous offer for this property. Well then why doesn't he make me a generous offer too? It's a very fair offer, Wallet. Mr. Dorsey has investigated the situation thoroughly. And I base my offer on his recommendation. Oh so, it's really Stinky's offer and not yours. Wallet, I've had enough of this. I'm warning you, if we can't come to terms, we'll be forced to build elsewhere in the neighborhood and you know what that means, don't you? You bet I do. It means that you'll get the overflow when all my seats are filled! You young idiot. You've got a chance to get out from under and you're too pig headed to take it. Well maybe you don't have a lease. Maybe you only think you have. Hey what was he talkin' about? Ah, he's just poppin' off. Yeah, I'm not so sure. Remember, I didn't sign that lease, Skeezix did! Hey. - Pudge, you got your car? I got mine. Then what are we waitin' for? I beg your pardon. Miss. Miss! Mr. Wallet! Yeah I know. It's nice to see ya! If you'd please. Yeah I know, a bowl of cereal and a glass of milk. But, no. You're a business man, Mr. Wallet. So is your father. I'm sure you both understand the situation. Right now that lease is an asset. You can sell it to us at a profit. If we take away the diner's patronage, however, that lease will become a liability. For five years, you'll have the dubious privilege of paying rent on an empty shell with boarded up windows. Oh, ya aren't gonna be pressured into sellin me out, are ya Skeez? If these big shots think they can run me outta business, let 'em try! Corky. Please. Now, look, you two. Will you excuse us a moment please? Certainly. Come on, boys. Now listen Corky, let's not get belligerent. We've had enough of that around here already. You mean my row with Dorsey? Well he's a low down- Listen, son. Grudges have no place in a business deal. And this here's business. Remember what you said when we went into this thing? You mean about no favors, everything just as if we were strangers? That's right. Did you mean it? - Well sure I meant it, Skeez. All right then, here's how I see it. On the one hand, we stand a chance of doubling our money. And on the other hand, we stand a very good chance of losing a thousand plus the prospect of getting stuck for five years rent if the diner folds. Yeah but the diner's not going to fold. Corky if you lock horns with PNG, I can't see a thing in it for ya but a good beating. I'm sorry, I'm taking you at your word, no family stuff. Skeez, listen a minute! All right Mr. Hacker, you got a deal. Yeah, yeah, all right. Hey Mortie, you like this joint, don't ya? Sure. Well we're in kinda financial difficulties. We need a thousand bucks. A partnership goes with it. Partnership, huh? Yeah. Do I get free hamburgers? Yeah. Coffee anytime I want? Yeah. Pie a la mode? Yeah. Sorry, Pudge, I'm broke. I beg your pardon. Sorry, Mr. Humphrey. - But I want to tip. You got your cereal, didn't ya? I hate cereal. I don't like cereal and if you need money, why don't you listen to me? I'm listening. I'm Charles Dee Haven of Haven and Channing. Yeah. Mr. Wallet has an option on that lot out there. That's right. I want to buy it from him. You mean that? Why yes. For money? Of course. Don't go away, don't go away! I'll get it. Hello? Yes he's here. For you, Corky. Oh thanks, Judy. Hello? Yeah, Pudge? He what? Did he say how much? Well get him over here as fast as you can. You bet I will! You got a car here? Yes it's right- Hold everything Corky, we'll be there flying! Watch the joint, Mortie! Turn off the lima beans in 10 minutes! Corky, I know Pudge from way back, he's full of dodges like this. But he shouldn't try to pull 'em on me. Skeezix believe me, I tell you he does have a buyer. Did I understand you to say Pudge? Would that be that overstuffed fry cook of yours? Hey now wait a minute- - Yes he's the chef. So now, in the very nick of time, the hamburger impresario pops up with a mysterious buyer? Well that does it, good day gentlemen. Mr. Hacker, please wait. Now, now, now, let's not be hasty. Just a minute Mr. Hacker. Corky, just who is this buyer Pudge is bringing? Well I don't know, Pop, he didn't say. Well gentlemen, I don't make a practice of saying things I don't mean. If I leave, I won't be back. Well Corky, it's up to you. Listen, Skeez- Oh Skeez won't turn ya down. He'll pass up this deal if you ask him to. But do you think you should ask him? Mr. Hacker, if Pudge is on his way he'll be here in 15 minutes. Will ya wait just 15 minutes? No. All right, Skeez, go ahead. Will you sit down, Mr. Hacker? Right this way sir. Skeezix, you better sit inside with me. Here, Mr. Pettit. Oh, thank you. Here we are. Comfortable? Won't you be seated, Mr. Dorsey? Cigarette sir? No thank you. Come on step on it, I told him we'd come aflyin', not crawlin'. I'm a very careful driver. Come on, cut loose, go ahead, do 30. I'd like to cut out this clause. It doesn't apply to our situation. Very well, anything else? No. Well then. Well that's strange, I must have left my fountain pen at the office. I have one. I never forget my fountain pen. Gentlemen, allow me. Judy, will you get the pen from my desk, please? Yes, daddy. Mr. Haven, please let me drive! Oh no, slow and steady wins the race you know. You wanna bet? Please release my foot! You wanna kill us both? Stop it! Solid, jack. Here, daddy. Oh thank you, Judy. Dry, huh? I'll get the ink. Nevermind Judy, I'll get it. Stop it, stop it I say! Turn right. Turn right. You're doin' fine! I'm sorry I can't find the ink. I'll try, mother. Slow down, slow down! I can't, it's stuck! Throw in the clutch, kill the ignition, do somethin'! Where, where? The clutch, the clutch! I haven't got one. It's Dyna Flush. Daddy. Not now Judy. I'd like to see the original lease, please. Pop, I wanna tell you. What is it Judy? There's no ink in the bottle. All right, what? What's that? My pen! I was only going to send them out to have the points sharpened. All right Joe, that's enough. Now you just sit right there and don't even come close to anybody or I'll have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry gentlemen. That's all right, all right. Let's get this thing over with. Now Mr. Wallet if you'll just sign the- Oh no! The papers. Where are those papers? - Pop, why don't you wait? Judy, where are they? If Corky's own family- Do you know where those papers are, yes or no? Here they are, I took them. No she didn't, I took them. No dad, I did. All right, all right, we'll talk about that later. Skeezix will you please sign these while I still have my sanity. I think. Hey Corky! Hold everything, hold everything! Hiya folks, I want you to meet Mr. Haven. Hi Mr. Haven. Pudge, what's the meaning of this? Business, Mr. Wallet, strictly business. Mr. Wallet, I fail to see what this- You will, you old nickel nursey, you will. Well Mr. Haven this is your man. Well you wanna buy his option don't ya? Well how much Mr. Haven, how much? He's a little nervous. We drove 70 getting here. I drove, and it was 80. An exciting experience, Mr. Wallet, most exciting. Yes Mr. Haven, but how much? How much? 80 miles an hour! No I mean how much money? You know for the option? Oh the option. $5000. $5000? Sold! Sold! Yes, sold, and thank you very much Mr. Haven! Hey pop, I'm in business again! Oh, Mr. Haven you're an angel. Well practically, my dear. I drove 80 miles an hour in a 25 mile zone. Well now, should we get down to money matters? A check perhaps? Well two checks, Mr. Haven, if you'd please. Why, certainly. Does anyone have a fountain pen? Well there you go, Skeez. I told you you'd be wearin' diamonds if you stuck with me. And as for this, right back into the diner. And you're still a partner. Oh, Mother, I'm so happy everything turned out all right. She's happy so she turns on the water works, How do you figure that? Frankly, I'm baffled. May I cut in, mom? Hey what do you say honey, should we tell 'em? If you want to. Corky! Tell us what? Corky, come on Corky, tell us. Well, folks, I guess we really should tell ya. We're gonna have an addition! To the diner. We're gonna build a patio and outdoor tables with umbrellas! And a barbecue grill.
