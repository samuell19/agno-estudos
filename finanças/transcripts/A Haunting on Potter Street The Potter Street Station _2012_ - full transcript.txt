- This is the second largest depot left in Michigan. Built in 1881, and it's the largest of this particular design left in the United States. We have heard information that military bodies were brought home to this station. The most notable ones of course would have been World War I, World War II. We have had two or three people that have told us about experiences of seeing a woman in a white dress. It was an arsonist that started the fire. But no one was ever caught or prosecuted for it. Welcome to the Potter Street Station. We're standing in the ladies waiting room. Back when the depot was built, it was built with segregated rooms. They had one waiting room for the women, and one waiting room for the men. Reports of activity in this room have included several items, several events. One of the volunteers while working here took picture of the seating in the back, and it showed, kind of, a figure sitting there waiting. Also there's been several reports of various people that we've had work here that have seen a woman in white. We're now in the men's waiting room, gentleman's waiting room, the activity that has been seen here has been a gentleman figure walking around, sometimes passing by the doorways. There's been chatter heard in this area and footsteps. We are now in the baggage room. The activity that has been sensed here has been through this door that people have sensed or seen a figure pass by the door on the outside. They've caught it sometimes in the corner of their eye. Or they've seen it. And also they've sensed that there's somebody, maybe, peeking around the door, checking on them, watching them. we're now in the storage and parts room that the railroad used to store. Be careful, though, loose wire right there. They used to store their parts and sometimes tools here. Some of the events that have happened here have been that some of the parts on the shelves have moved. Also, we have had people say that their tools have been moved from various locations though they've been using them on other locations on site, and so they've had to go looking for them. And they think it's a practical joke, or whatever, but they have found that they have been moved. We're standing in the room that is referred to as a locker room. They have lockers in here that the railroad workers might have used on their day to day work chores. We have some remnants here of the grand staircase that we have saved to replicate them when the staircase is restored back in the original shape. The activity that has been experienced here has been some squeaking, perhaps the doors opening. Some people think they have seen that. And also there has been talking been heard in here. This is a back office in the depot on the first floor. And more than likely it'd have been where somebody took work orders and processed them. There's an opening in the doorway where they could have slid them through the shelf on that. And then this is a bay window area here whereas anyone working back here could see the trains coming from either direction, so you have clear visibility. Out in the hallway here there has been footsteps heard and there has been a figure seen crossing the openings up there. The room that we're entering now was part of the original restaurant that was here when the depot was built. In more recent years, it was used by Richard Froeber, an undertaker, he stored caskets here. As you can see these are casket stands. There's three of them here. During World War II, it was more than likely that the bodies of our men killed in action were brought back to this depot. Perhaps they arrived here before being taken somewhere else. This is the room at the other end that is the freight room. We have secured it totally. There was some original damage back some years ago, and so we've sealed it off, and we have, most of the people won't go near it. They're afraid to go in there, not because of any damage but because of things that they've heard. And we'll let you make your own decision on whether you wanna go in there in the future or not. - Okay, I'm just about set to go here. All the gear's ready, the cameras have been charged up as well as the infrareds, the walkie talkies, everything. The hard drive's been wiped clean off the cameras and the audio recorders, so everything's set to go for the long haul this evening. We've got a bunch of flashlights. Everyone should keep one with them at all times. Because there's a lot of soft spots throughout the whole building in the floors. So, something to be careful of. Another concern that I have is running power down to the other areas of the building, so we need to run some extension cords. Gotta be careful about tripping over those outside. There's a lot of debris and it's dark. I'm excited, though, I think it's going to be a good investigation, to say the very least after hearing the stories about the building I'm really excited to see if it lives up to everything here. - Base temperature of the floor is 54.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Yeah, we're doing the investigation here tonight, at the Potter Street Station. It's a building I've known about for most of my life. The location is pretty much legendary. It's like a compound here. It's gonna be a little bit intimidating being locked in. They've got barbed wire fence all over the place. I don't even know what the square footage is, I'm gonna have to say 30,000 square feet. Can't wait to see what kind of stuff we find. I'm looking forward to it. - So, we've got nearly 30,000 square feet. About a dozen rooms, collapsing floors, loose brick walls, it's gonna be a very dangerous investigation tonight. But from what we understand, a very productive investigation. The people here at the preservation society have claimed to see a woman in white. Some of their tools, while trying to restore the building, come up missing and end up on other ends of the building. The list goes on. Even an apparition was photographed was photographed in the women's waiting room. So, right now, safety inspections are done. Everyone's in place, let's get this thing going. Potter Street Station. - Good luck, gentlemen, you're gonna need it. - Due to the station's massive size, I decided to split up the team to investigate alone. Although this violates our safety protocol, I felt it would be the only way to investigate the entire location before dawn. This is Prozak entering the baggage room of the Potter Street Station. So, right now we're about to start investigating the baggage room here, and back in the day about 50 trains, Keith said, would travel to and from this location, hundreds of passengers. One of the recent. One of the beliefs out there is that the spirits can be attached to worldly possessions, due to the fact that there's still luggage remaining here, and different antiques and things of that nature. This could be one of the reasons for paranormal activity. Let's go give this theory a try. Would anybody like to communicate with me? Me and my friends are gonna spend the evening here with you guys, we'd love to talk to you. Maybe you could tell us about the old train station, what it was like? There's some old cabinets here. Check this out up here, looks like an old beer bottle. Aw, that sucks, some vandals must have thrown a rock through that window and broke it. They had to board all the windows up. That glass has gotta be about a half inch thick. They don't make that no more. Did you travel from the station? Maybe you were here for your baggage? Maybe you left something behind? Look at this ladder. This room's gotta be about damn near 30 feet high. It's impossible to try to figure out if you're hearing something or not because the winds are so crazy out there. I keep thinking I'm hearing something, but then you hear the wind howling like that. If you are in here with me, could you move something? Maybe one of the items on the table here? - Adam entering the locker room. This is the room where employees of the Potter Street Station would have been able to store their belongings while working their shifts. Up here you've got the old communications room where the main mode of communication would have been by Morse code, again, really an indicator of the time period. Not quite as grandiose of a room as some of the customer areas, but definitely still a pretty magnificent piece of architecture to say the least. Setting the recorder down. I'm looking to make contact with anything that's in this room with me. Are you here? - All right, check this out, come here. I don't know if you can pick this up with the infrared or not, but it says 1881. Of course, that's when the station was built. So you know that's original. As a matter of fact look at this, you can see these broken pieces here. This was probably crested right up on the side of the building. It's a shame that it's like this. Could you please. Did you see that? Could you please? Did you see that? Over there, watch your step. Is that you in there, are you in this corner? I know it moved, did you see it move? I know you had to have got that. That thing moved about six, seven inches. And nobody could possibly fit in that. That's got a little give on it. Not that much, though. I can feel a lot of wind coming, there's a hole right here. This hole in the wall goes into the ladies waiting room. There is definitely some wind action going on in here. So, that could have very well done that. Okay, I definitely heard some shuffling or something right here. Are you playing games with me? I heard that's what you like to do. That's all right. You've got all night. I'm not gonna lie, this place is kinda creepy. - Is somebody back here? I definitely heard breathing. I can't see anything. You don't have to be afraid. Come out towards the center. No need to hide in the corner. Can you tell me your name, something about yourself? Why you're here? Come right towards the center, right towards where the remains here of the master staircase are. I know it's not probably where you're used to seeing these pieces. The staircase itself used to be through this archway. Over the years this was closed off. Did you used to walk up and down these stairs? Hey, check this out, look at this. It's definitely a bone. - Did you work here at one point? Are you a former employee? What's your name? What the hell? What's the reason that you're still here? Wow, really be careful through here. I'm catching my feet on everything. What? Did you open this? - What the hell used to be in this? Is this like the main water supply for the whole place? I guess it has to be. Is this like the sewage area? No, looks like all the rainwater from outside is getting sucked in here. What was that? - All of us have been warned not to investigate certain areas of the building. We were doing so at our own risk. This type of investigating is extremely dangerous and not recommended. - What the hell fell in the water? I hit my fucking head. I'm losing my balance here. This is gonna suck. What the fuck is going on here? Hello. You all heard that, right? - This was sticking, so I had to push this open. I walked right here. Are you in here with us right now? If you are make another sign. Can you open this cabinet? What was that? - You see all this roof that's all caving in? These are ready to drop on the floor, all this shit. Hello. Hello. Hello. - During every investigation we set up several stationary cameras to document paranormal activity or abnormal occurrences. The following clip was recorded in the baggage room. - I'm Brent Shay, Executive Producer of the Potter Street Station documentary. Earlier this evening we were touring the building and I had a chance to wander off on my own, and I encountered something that I've never seen in my life before, I just, am not gonna go back in that building. I hope they're gonna be okay. Not only because of the structural problems, but because of other things. - Potter Street Station has a long standing definition of being haunted. I believe probably that's because it has so much history, there's been so many happenings so many physical experiences that a lot of that residue is still here. Energy doesn't always dissipate, and I think we see that at Potter Street. A lot of people have had experiences. Because I think that energy doesn't always dissipate all the time, especially if it's sad it gets kinda stuck, and do I believe that it's haunted? I definitely do, I definitely believe that there is unrest here. - Prozak, Richard Frobler room, the casket maker. Wow, look at these columns. This room is massive. They used to put the caskets on these back in the day. See the old pads? It's kinda morbid. Make sure you watch your step. There's all kinds of boards here. Would anybody like to communicate with me? Man, these things are just laying everywhere. I guess back in the day they had the casket maker right here in the train station, because of all the bodies that would come back from the war, so it was very handy to have a casket maker right here. That way the family didn't have to look very far to shop for one. There's a lot of history in this building. We're told that a spirit haunts this area of the building. Did you return here to the Potter Street Station from war? - Whoa, this a really big hole here. Watch your step, this floor is actually, looks like it's all rotted out. You might wanna just stand right there and just shoot from there, so we don't both go through. Setting the recorder down. Also, setting the K2 meter down. - Digital recorders are used in the field to catch disembodied voices and other phenomenon. K2 meters use flashing lights to signal fluctuation in electromagnetic energy, which often occurs when a spirit is near. - Is there anybody back here with me? I'm not here to trespass. I'm not here to vandalize anything. Just here looking for proof that you're here. A lot of members of the board, including our friend Keith, say they feel an upset energy back here. Something that seems to make them afraid or uncomfortable in this area. Is that you that's causing that energy? Why are you angry? - Can you tell us how old you are? Wow, look at this. See all that charred wood from the fire? That's a massive piece of wood right there. I really would like to communicate with you. Got an old bathroom over here. Could you tell us what year it is? Wow, check this out. We've got an old helmet back here. I swear I thought that chair just moved right there. Is that you over there in the corner? - Were you here at the station in angst? Going somewhere maybe not such a happy trip? Maybe it's just my flashlight beam, but I swear that that stall door was moving. - I really would love to talk to you? Jesus, wow, look at this. In memory of. It's a bunch of old funeral invitations. Now, that's creepy. Just pages and pages. I wonder how old these are? This is probably the creepiest place I've ever investigated in my life. Not to mention the most dangerous. Whoa, watch out, we've got a loose board there. I really would love to communicate with you. Were you part of the armed forces? Did you help protect the United States? Look at this, funeral goods, do not crush. I thought I saw this chair move. I'm gonna go ahead and set this device right here on the chair. Maybe you could come sit down and talk to me. What war were you in? Where did they send you? Could you say that one more time, please? That's more of those pads right there for the casket. It's kind of ominous. I'm not that positive, something just moved right there. Did you guys get that? Is that you in there? Could you please try to communicate with me just talk right into this light. How did you die? - Give me some kind of sign right now. Are you still here? You don't seem that scary to me. You can tell me why you're angry. You can tell me why you're angry. - Unseen by the investigator at the time the infrared camera picked up a traveling orb of light. Many paranormal researchers believe orbs to be spirits in motion. - Maybe we can help. Nothing. I'm gonna leave these two here. Let's go grab a stationary camera and set it up just to make sure if anything else goes on in here, I wanna make sure we catch it. - The following clip is recorded several moments after setting up the stationary camera. It turns out Adam wasn't alone after all. What's most profound about the evidence are the multiple confirmations of a paranormal event. The K2 meter indicates a dramatic fluctuation in electromagnetic energy, a mist begins manifesting just seconds after, and lastly, the stall door moved on its own. - I've been outside for a while and I haven't heard any communication over the radio. I hope they're okay inside. This place really gives me the chills. - I think that they're going to find that there's a lot of friendly spirits in there that are gonna come out, but I think there's gonna be some that are a little afraid to come out and see you, and talk to you, because they're not sure if you're a friend or not. Even though if you say you are, they're still not positive about it, but I think it's gonna be a very good experience. You know, I really do, they're gonna see and hear a lot of different things in there, from way, way, way back. - Jesus. Hello. Is there anybody here? This place is beat to hell. Anybody here who would like to speak with me? Would like to communicate tonight? This place is fucking creepy. Hello, are you here can you give me a sign? - This is Prozak entering the ticket booth room. Check this out. Certificate of merit presented to the employees, Saginaw, Michigan, no accidents 1959. Wow. Look at the detail in all the woodwork. The craftsmanship from back in the day. This place is amazing. So, over here, this is the old ticket booth counter. So, this is where everybody would come up and buy their tickets right at this very spot. It's kind of amazing when you think about the history. They said this was the second main hub in the entire state, Detroit being number one. So, thousands of people would have left from this very place to visit family, or to go off to war. Some of them not coming back alive. - It just got cold in here. It's right here. Like I said, it feels like it's coming from right here. This all boarded up. Looking up there it's all boarded up, too. My face is freezing, dude. Feel kinda weird sometimes when that happens, 'cause it's like you're walking through them. Feel kinda weird sometimes when that happens, 'cause it's like you're walking through them. Feel kinda weird sometimes when that happens, 'cause it's like you're walking through them. - What the hell? Come here. Look at this. Whatever it was was strong, I mean, to knock these off. These are solid wood. Hello? What would have just caused all this? I don't feel it, I don't feel a train going by. Usually you can feel it under your feet. Would somebody like to communicate with me? Are you angry that we're here? It's got dates on here, 1972, 1973. Does it upset you that we're inside the building tonight? That door just move? - Hear it? That's coming from inside the building. What the fuck is that? Watch out, dude, I don't want you to get caught up in this stuff. It seems that it's coming from inside the building. - Come here. I swear I just saw something right here. Only it was quick, it was a dark figure. It is believed that when a spirit or entity tries to manifest it draws energy from it's surroundings, reducing the ambient temperature of a room, this becomes visible in that you can actually see my breath due to the dramatic and sudden drop in temperature. Come here. I swear that I just saw something right here. Only it was quick. It was a dark figure. It was right on this corner. Hello. There's no reason to hide. There's no reason to hide. There's no reason to hide. - Can you make that noise again for us? Wow, this got fucked up. Look at that. That's crispy right there. That's like, this is where the fire was. Damn, this is so, wood's not supposed to do that. This thing got burnt to a crisp. Look at it, though. It's weird how it just, it's there, it comes down here, and stops right there, just in that window. It came down, it spread here, and it stopped. - The following clips display two very prominent pieces of evidence. Nobody was either in, or near the rooms at this exact time of recording. The evidence in this next clip almost went undetected. A shadow man is seen running through the men's waiting room, then vanishes on camera. - I think there are several spirits that haunt the Potter Street Station. And I think that they're more or less watching over it. They're guarding it. - In my estimation, I would say for sure it is haunted. And I would say it's haunted by many spirits. And not just one. - We've asked the spirits what is it that you want from us. - We've seen a lot and heard a lot. Had many, many different experiences. - And they have said, or acknowledged, time and time again that they want us to help save it. Because it's their home and they don't wanna lose their home. - There's a lot of energy in here. A lot of good energy, a little bit of bad, a lot of sadness in here, I've felt it all ever since the first step into it. - Right now we're about to go down into the boiler room of the Potter Street Station. Let's go. Wow, look at the floor in here. Make sure you're careful. Jesus. Yo, we're gonna have to go down one at a time. So, let me go down first. The staircase doesn't look very sturdy. Wow, this place is pretty intense. Gotta make sure you watch your step in this place. Got a nice hole right there in the ground. What is this? That's crazy, looks like a diagram of how the boiler room used to heat the building. Got another room in here. That looks a little suspect. You wanna go in? Let's do it. Man. We've got a doorway. What was that? Hello? Yo! Dude these are fucking bricks, falling out of the wall down here. Let's get the fuck out of here. This isn't necessarily worth that. We've got more going, go, go, go, go! The following clip was recorded in the hallway leading to the back office. Not only did the IR camera pick up the sounds of disembodied footsteps, but also the debris on the floor moving in conjunction with them. The next clip displays shocking paranormal interaction with tangible objects, observe. You can actually see two spirit orbs enter the room, open the lockers, then exit the same way they entered. - During the safety inspection this hallway was flagged as a hazardous area where we should keep investigators out of. The reason for that is because it's beginning to collapse. You can actually see bricks that are tearing through the wall, so, it's definitely dangerous back here, but after talking it over with Prozak, we really decided that we can't leave any stone unturned, so right now, we're gonna head back into this portion of the building, and look for any kind of activity. I've got a thermometer with me to gather some base readings, and also a digital recorder. Just trying to capture anything that's here, really. We really need to watch out. There's a lot of debris on the floor here. And again this hallways is starting to collapse. I'm really not sure how stable it is, but just make sure you step lightly. It feels pretty solid so far. You're good, you're good. Man, look at this. You're good, you're good. Man, look at this. You're good, you're good. Man, look at this. The floor feels pretty solid here. Let's see what's back in this room? Looks like there's some bars on this window back here that's kind of interesting. See all those? Wonder what they used this area for? Looks like we've got an average base reading of 54 degrees Fahrenheit - Is anybody here? Trying to communicate with anybody that might be here. I've got a device that allows me to talk to you. Or at least hear you. If you have anything to say just talk into this little red light. My name's Tim. My name's Tim. My name's Tim. What's your name? - After reviewing the surveillance footage, we were able to rule out human interference in the men's waiting room. No one other than Tim and the cameraman had entered or left the location, leaving the dark figure to be classified as paranormal. - You know, the wind's blowing pretty hard outside, but this room that we're in is secure from the outside walls, so I don't think that anything would be blowing through the exterior and into here as well. But, man that is cold. How long have you been here? Is there anything you can tell me to do that can help you? Is there anything you can tell me to do that can help you? Is there anything you can tell me to do that can help you? - There was a lot of crazy emotions that went through this room. They hear stories about how the men going off to war, all the uncertain futures. You know, a lot of them didn't make it home. Is anybody here? Did you hear that? Was that you? I'm totally hearing something. Say something again. Just make noise. Do you smell that? I swear to God, I'm smelling like, cigar smoke, or pipe or something. What's your name? Are you from Saginaw? - The following activity occurred in the back office. If you listen closely, you can hear the sound of the light bulb being unscrewed before it falls from the fixture. This supports the theory of poltergeist activity at the station. After reviewing this next clip, we were finally able to validate the eyewitness claims of a notorious woman in white. - All right, we just caught on the IR, we just saw something move by here. I don't know where the hell it was going, because there's no room to move. It came in like this. You don't see it in this windows, so, it started here. And it just walks by like this. But it doesn't go anywhere, there's nowhere to go. I wonder if this is like an office or something. Some dude's doing his work. Watch out for that. Damn, you fall through there it's gonna be a bad day. A visit to the ER right there. Anybody here? Anybody here? Anybody here? - This is Prozak in the women's waiting room. Of course notice I said women's waiting room. Back then it used to be segregated in public, as Keith was telling us. This is really interesting here. This luggage was actually found during the restoration of the building. So they've got it on display here. Some of these old trunks, these things actually survived the fire. Whoa, okay, it's a little mouse took off there. So, we were trying to conduct an interview with Keith Wizner and we had him sitting here in front of the old Victorian fireplace. And we heard a woman scream two different times. So, we're gonna see if we can try and make some contact. The scream came from this area, which really coincides with something that Lee told us, that one of the people had a photograph in this exact chair looked like an apparition is sitting there in white. And that really kind of goes with the woman in white theory. So, we're gonna see if we can get some communication. K2. We're here to establish contact with the woman in white. We're here to establish contact with the woman in white. - Dude, all the hair on the back of my neck just stood up. Hello, I'm right here if you wanna come out and say hi. It's right after we saw this thing walk by. I'm saying hi, I'd like to meet ya. Why don't you show yourself? Where did that come from? Right over here, right? Something just whooped my face. Touched my face. Something just touched my face. Is there anything leaning down here? Something just brushed my face, on the side of my face. That was weird. There's no mark there or anything, is there? See a mark or anything? Something just went like that, it brushed my face. - I apologize for being in the wrong waiting room here. Perhaps it's a little improper, but I would really like to make your acquaintance. Is this the spot that you used to sit in here? Is that why you keep coming back? If you could come sit down in your favorite spot here, you can make a meter light up. I would know that you're here with me. - Hey, sorry to interrupt but just letting you know the camera's getting a low battery. - Can you tell us why you're screaming? Is somebody trying to hurt you? Did somebody hurt you? Hey, that light's moving, dude. That fucking light is swinging. Do you see this, are you getting it? - I could have sworn there was somebody on the stairs. I turned around and all I saw was a shadow right in the middle of the stairwell, then it just vanished. I don't know if it was just my eyes playing tricks on me. Where is the fucking light? There it is. I think I got it. I can never find this damn thing. There we go. Come here. What the fuck is that? Dude, that was not there. That's really freaky, like seriously freaky, like it's trying to tell us something. - I just saw it spike to red one time. Did you come to join me? Can you please say something? It came from over this way, right here. Is that you that moved the lights? Are you angry that we're in here? Can you please tell us anything? Why were you screaming? What happened to you? Did somebody hurt you here at the station? Is that why you still linger? Wow, they're still moving, dude. Still moving. Did you touch me? Did you just touch my shoulder? Are you sure? Are you positive? Something just tapped me right on the shoulder, dude. There's nothing hanging. You're sure the camera didn't bump me? - I'm positive the camera did not touch you. It just got really cold. - Where are you? Are you standing here next to me? Could you please say anything at all? This is creepy. - The battery light's flashing red the camera's about to. - Are you serious? You got anymore batteries on you? - No, I don't. I could go get one, though. I don't understand, this was a fresh battery. - Shit. - Sh, sh, what was that? - What the hell was that? - I heard it, too. - That, in the corner, did you see that? - I see it. - Is that you? - my God. - The woman in white?
