I-I can't... just can't figure out why these kids want to take less money to sign for a rival shoe company. I mean, why would a kid from Baltimore want to wear German soccer shoes? Because Adidas is what's hot right now, man. The rappers are wearing them in the videos. The break-dancers are break-dancing up in the Bronx. They're on the floor breaking their ankles and their elbows for no reason. And these kids ain't cool unless they got Adidas on. And them some badass jogging suits, too. You got to admit we can't touch their jogging suits. I got my cousin in South Korea done sent me two knockoffs. I wear them on the weekends. I don't wear them up here. What is wrong with Nike? Nike is a damn jogging company, man. Black people don't jog. You ain't gonna catch no Black person running 26 miles for no damn reason. Man, the cops probably pull you over thinking you done stole something. 'Cause these kids are talking about Isiah and Magic. They don't give a damn about Bruce Jenner throwing a Frisbee around in a damn decathlon. And people don't know what the hell a Nike is. What's a Converse? NBA All Star shoe. Play like Magic, dribble like Isiah. That's what it is. Man, do you know Run-DMC doing a song about Adidas? What, who? Run-DMC making a free song coming out on their next album about Adidas. Who's doing it? See, that tells me something right there, Sonny. Hey, when you signed Moses, how'd you do it? Mary Malone. His mama. I... She thought the world of me. But, you know, I always go through the mamas, man. The mamas run stuff, especially in Black families. Man, we need some more players, Sonny. You got to get me somebody else. Well, we got Moses. I know we got Moses, man. I was up in the club with him 3:00 in the morning last night trying to get him out of there 'cause he got a 5:00 practice. I told him, I said, "Moses, you can't hoot with the owls all night and fly with the eagles in the morning." Yeah, I could not do what you do. I know you can't do what I do. You can hardly do what the hell you supposed to do. Hey, one more chance. You want that Adidas suit from South Korea? (chuckles) No. - Better not tell nobody neither. - No. No. Phil better not come up talking about no damn, "Where's your Adidas suits?" I need my job, Sonny. Don't play. Uh, shit, I'm late. You hit one shot in 30 minutes. Let's get out of here. I got to stop by my office. Damn back and my knees are messing up now. Hey, Sonny, look at these damn posters down here. They upstairs in the running department got Picassos. - No. - We got cartoons down here. They don't give a damn about our division. You know, I-I like the, uh... that new slogan, the one for the whole company that they're talking about. - I don't like it. - What? - You know where it came from? - No. That damn slogan came from a convict about to get executed in front of a firing squad, and they asked him, "What's your last words?" "Just do it"? - Yeah. - That's where that comes from? Yeah. - Bullshit. - Dan Wieden told me, man. He ain't got no reason to lie to me. Ah, kind of a fitting metaphor for the way basketball is viewed at this company. I know. "Nike. Just get the shit over with." - (laughs) - Ow. What'd it say about me that I liked it? That says that you a fat middle-aged white guy that don't want to exercise. That's fair. (projector clicking) STRASSER: So, Mr. Orwell was right. 1984 has been a tough year. Our sales are down, our growth is down, but this company is about who we really are when we are down for the count. Am I right, huh? When you're down on the canvas, bang, we pop right back up. Like Balboa. We got the eye of the tiger. We're not gonna go down to Mr. T. Pity the fool. Here we go. Olajuwon. Off the table. Number one pick is not gonna be wearing our shoe. Sam Bowie? Picked by our local pro franchise, uh, at number two. He's gonna go to Converse. And at number three, Jordan going to Adidas. Can't afford him. Perkins, who knows? Sweet gap, though, huh? Nice teeth. What we're gonna do is we're gonna focus on three names between pick five and pick 20. All right, let's just... let's toss out some ideas. What are we thinking? What looks good? Lots to choose from. Don't rush into any thoughts. Come on, fellas. What about Lancaster Gordon? Anybody? Louisville. Louisville. He went to Louisville, Bill. That is correct. I wrote it right there. How about... What do we think about Charles Barkley, the Round Mound of Rebound? Could be a little bit of a reach for us - at pick five. - Clubhouse issues. Clubhouse issues? What does that mean? Trash talk. Nobody wants to see Barkley on TV. STRASSER: Does anybody hear me if I'm down in the valley singing the song of a man they call Terence "T Bone" Stansbury? I don't think they call him that. Well, we could if he wears Nikes. Think about it. What about this fella, Vern Fleming? Tough name, good J. I like Melvin Turpin. Melvin Turpin. Thank you, Bill. On the board. TIM: What about John Stockton? Uh, he's scrappy just like us. Gonzaga? Sure. What's that, a vocational school? SONNY: What do you like about Melvin Turpin? Hmm? Mel Turpin. What do you like about his game? Go, Bill. He made the Final Four last year. Well, so did 40 other guys. He's the fifth... uh, s-sixth pick in the draft. SONNY: Have you watched him play? Yeah, several times. What-what do you like about his game? He's got great court sense. He's, uh... - He's got good vision. - He had 33 assists last season. BILL: I like his play. - I like that the guy's got... - Okay, all right, no, no. It's all right, no. He's gonna be a good player. He's got charisma. He's got flash. He's gonna be a good player in Europe in four years when he's out of the league. - Okay. - No, you like Mel Turpin 'cause he's the sixth pick in the draft. Nobody's gonna give you shit for saying you like the sixth pick in the draft. Yeah, I'm just... I'm some fucking asshole, Sonny. You're not an asshole. SONNY: No, he's got great vision, Bill. Sonny's trying for it, though. Here we go. Anybody else? I got to shit. - (door closes) - SONNY: Hey, Rob. STRASSER: Hey, Sonny, wh... honestly, what the fuck is your problem? - Who are we gonna get? - (urinating) You tell me. Phil brought you here because you're the Mr. Miyagi of high school basketball. You're not supposed to lecture people. You're supposed to tell us who's gonna paint the fence. - I like Barkley some. - (scoffs) - I mean, "clubhouse issues." - Barkley? That is the fucking dumbest thing I have ever heard in that room, and that is saying something. I mentioned Barkley in there. You didn't think it was relevant to chime in to support my idea about Barkley... But what happens in there is bullshit. I'm telling you now. - ...spend two hours just sitting there? - I'm not gonna say it in the meeting. STRASSER: Well, listen, people are - afraid to speak in there. - Why? Because you spend a half hour berating them - no matter what they say. - No, no. - STRASSER: Yes, you do. - I just have no tolerance for people who have no insight, fucking do no work, and then act like they got a seat at the table. - Okay. - Mel Turpin. We'd be better off signing my mom. Not available. Well, even if she were alive, we can't afford her. Could afford my mom. Clubhouse issues. Listen, we got 250K for three names. This is where you come up with a brilliant idea that no one else can see. - Let's hear it. - We need more money. That's not brilliant, okay? That's what happens when things are successful. What's happening right now is failure, and if it continues that way, Nike's gonna be out of the basketball business and we're gonna be out of a job. We just... We need good players. We need good players. Great. Good players. Barkley, Stockton, Thorpe. I really like Stockton. Do you even know where Gonzaga is? I didn't say it's ideal, okay? It's a name, which is better than what you've given me, okay? - Rob. Rob. - Yeah? What? What about Jordan? (scoffs) Sonny, we can't get fucking Michael Jordan. Okay? I listened to Falk for three hours. He's too expensive. - Sorry. - Mr. Strasser. Huh? Hello. Hi. - Richard. - Yeah. Hi. Hi, Richard. I'd love to get some time on your calendar. Okay. That sounds fun. Can you let Doreen know? Roger that. Will do. - Roger, thank you. - Richard. Yeah, yeah. Just rogering you back there. - Yeah. - That's what that was, okay? - Thanks, Richard. - Thank you. Bye. (sighs): Oh, God. You know, there... Thank you. There, uh, there used to be a time where I could name everybody who worked here. Ah, things change. Places grow. That's true.

(door closes) Why do you think this guy is skateboarding to work? We're a public company. Does he not have a car? SONNY: Probably just some kid. He looks like he's 50 years old. He's bald and he has a beard. SONNY: Is that Pete? KNIGHT: Why would Pete skateboard to work? Maybe he's having a midlife crisis. Oh. I hope he doesn't scratch my car. - (sighs) - It takes 17 layers of paint to achieve that precise color of purple. They call it "grape," which sounds kind of pedestrian, but it's pretty. Anyway, how was the strategy meeting? Disaster. Uh, wonderful. What's the plan? Piss away our tiny allocation on three mediocre players again. Sonny, we had an annual loss. I had to lay off a quarter of the fucking company, okay? - I know, Phil. - Do you? Do you know the whole basketball division's on the chopping block? That the board wants me to fire everybody? And I can't guarantee you, without some improvement, that's not gonna happen at the next board meeting. W-We need to increase spending. (scoffs) I brought you in here to grow the basketball business. It's-it's smaller now. Is Strasser's number right? - 250K? - Yeah. - All right, what about 500? - No. You're lucky to have 250K. I had to fight for that. Your balance sheet's a debacle. Half the running shoes in the country that were sold last year were Nikes. It's 900 million in revenue. You want to spend 250K on basketball? You know what they're telling the board? There are potentially a million customers for basketball shoes in the United States, who would wear those shoes only when they're playing basketball. They're wondering if any investment is worth the potential upside. Well, if a board member said it. The board... Basketball is the future. The NBA finals are on tape delay. It's literally the past. People watch basketball. You know, we took four golds at the Olympics. And nobody gives a fuck. We dominate the running shoe market, Sonny. 200 million running shoes, 'cause that's what people do. They run. And when they walk, they wear running shoes. And when they go to the store, they wear running shoes, and when they go to work, they wear running shoes. That's what they do. People are starting to ask me what you do here. You know what I do here. I-I know you, I know you go to a lot of high school basketball tournaments. And, uh, usually with a layover in Vegas. And I-I'm told that you're a basketball guru or wizard or... (stammers) It's hard to quantify that to a board. You know what I do here. You're losing, Sonny. You know, just because you lose, it doesn't mean it wasn't a good bet. This perfect results bullshit... - It's not bullshit. - It is bullshit. It's not bullshit. Those are the central principles that built this into a billion-dollar business. I can't win if you don't give me a bankroll. You have to be accountable. You're accountable. We're all accountable. I'm accountable to the board. I told you not to go public. I told you this would happen. - You'd get tight, you'd change. - I see. - This happens at every company. - Uh, does it? - All the companies you've taken public? - Yeah, every company, all they care about is the P and L statement and-and keeping the board happy. Do you run? (sighs) Is this gonna lead to some Buddhist aphorism I don't want to hear? Do you run? (sighs) - No, Phil, I don't. - It's hard. It's suffering. It's difficult. The illusion is that the finish line is the destination, but the act itself is the destination. I need $500,000. (knock on door) Mr. Knight, your 1:00 p.m. Yeah. (chuckles) Okay, Phil.

You're not mad about Jordan? A guard? (scoffs) Hell nah. I mean, he's averaging, what, 17 points, - which is like ten in the NBA. - Yeah.

CLERK: I mean, if he hadn't hit that one shot to win the title game in the college championship, he probably would've never went that high in the draft. He's too small to be as good in the NBA as he was in college. You seem like a true fan. (sighs) I don't know, man.

( SportsLook theme playing) This is the racket I won Wimbledon with, and you could've bought it. Really. You see, the Ashe Comp 2 Racquet I use comes right off the production line. And I don't customize my racket because the Ashe Comp 2 is just the way I want it just the way it is. And it should be. Ed and I have worked together since 1969, putting in all the special features we thought important. So this particular Head racket could have gone to you as easily as to me. We planned it that way. ( SportsLook theme playing) (VCR rewinding) ...Michael Cooper, among other Lakers, has his own summer camp for young kids, and, uh, if you're interested... ♪ ♪ (VCR rewinds) (VCR rewinds) (VCR rewinds) (phones ringing) - Yeah?

Sonny, I-I'm gonna be done in five minutes. - I need you done now. - Um, w... you guys are busy. - Richard, uh... - It's fine. STRASSER: Richard, I'm sorry. We're gonna follow up, okay? Thank you. You know, uh, Sonny, in business, there's a way in which we conduct ourselves. - Like we... - I found him. - Who's that, Jesus? - Sit down. Okay. (chuckles) Lynwood Robinson. That name mean anything to you? - No. - Great recruit. Everybody was after this kid. North Carolina got him. He actually announced his decision to go there the same day that Michael Jordan did. It was actually bigger news in the Charlotte Observer, got a bigger headline. Within two years, Lynwood Robinson transfers to Appalachian State. Nobody heard about him again. Now, watch. STRASSER: This is the 1982 championship. The shot that Jordan makes. I've seen this. Everyone's seen this. No, we've been looking at it wrong. Watch. Here's James Worthy, okay? Number one in his draft class, another guy we had no chance of signing. - Correct. - Why isn't he getting the ball? They're down by one. There's under a half a minute to go. Why isn't the superstar getting the ball? Why is the ball going to the 18-year-old skinny freshman from Wilmington, North Carolina? Eh, they probably drew up the play for Worthy, and Jordan was an option in case Worthy was covered. No, that's wrong. Worthy is a decoy. We've been looking at this wrong. Look. He knows he's not getting the ball. They're in a 1-3-1 zone. What's gonna happen the second Worthy comes across the lane? That zone's gonna collapse on him, leaving Michael Jordan open in the corner, and the ball's gonna go to him, and he's gonna shoot it. Look, when he shoots it, he shoots it right away. He knows he's getting the ball. The play is drawn up for Jordan. And now that you know that... watch Jordan. You feel like your plane is on its final descent, or are you just circling? Look at him. Look at how relaxed he is. Look, he wants the ball. He's calling for the ball. The whole world is watching him. He's 18 years old. He's three seconds away from the biggest shot of his life. And the biggest shot of Dean Smith's life. Remember the knock on Dean Smith? He couldn't win the big one. He'd been there three times, couldn't get it done. This is his fourth and maybe his last time. Dean Smith didn't even start freshmen. Michael's only the third freshman to start for the guy. And what does he do? He puts the ball in the hands of an 18-year-old freshman. Why? Because Dean sees the same thing that I see. The same thing that Lynwood Robinson saw. Greatness. I don't want to sign three players. I want to sign one. I want to sign him. We build a shoe line around just him. We tap into something deeper, into the player's identity. Into that. What's that mean? That he doesn't wear the shoe. He is the shoe. The shoe is him. You want to anthropomorphize the shoe? Put little legs and arms on it? (sighs) Have you seen the Arthur Ashe commercial? (stammers) "This is the racket that I won Wimbledon with, that you could've bought it." We do that but with a shoe. I'm gonna blow a quick 20 right here, okay? It's gonna cost too much money. No, not if we bet it all on one guy. Too risky. You want the whole budget? - The whole budget. - Can't do that. We're gonna spread it across three or four players. - I've said that. - We have 250K. We can get him for 250K. Guess who else has 250K. Adidas has 250K, too, okay? So even if we were to offer him $250,000, Adidas would be able to match it. Meanwhile, all our other prospects have signed with other teams. Plus, Jordan has made it abundantly clear, painfully clear, that he doesn't want to come here. So you would have to have a pretty compelling pitch. Do you have that? Yeah, I can tell him the one thing the other companies can't compete with. Our basketball division is fucking terrible. I do not love it. You think Phil gonna go for that? But you like the idea, right? - The idea? Of Michael Jordan? - Yeah. - What you gonna offer him? - The whole budget. As in nobody else getting no money? Phil is gonna fire you. Well, I can handle Phil. The key to Phil is make him afraid. You gonna get us both damn fired. Phil got a hundred million dollars and a life supply of them damn pink, nut-hugging jogging shorts. The hell is he afraid of? Let's say you get Phil. How the hell you gonna get Michael? Michael is an Adidas guy. He loves Adidas. That's all he wear. Them badass warm-up suits, shell toe. Michael don't want to come to Nike badder than that damn guy sitting in the briar patch. Well, I'll deal with that after I deal with Phil. Phil ain't gonna do it. But you like the idea, right? I'd like to sign Jordan. But what I don't know is what his agent gonna ask for. ("The Message (Re-Mastered)" playing) (line ringing) SONNY (over phone): David. Sonny, Sonny, Sonny. Good morning, Falk. It's the afternoon for those of us in the real world. What's new in the wilds of Oregon? I hear Nike's getting out of the basketball business. Who told you that? FALK: You know, I have clients in other sports. I just signed Boomer Esiason, great-looking kid, and Boomer... it's interesting, because what Boomer does... David, David, David. I don't give a fuck. I'm calling about... Michael Jordan. I told Strasser months ago, it's never gonna happen. - Well, you never talked to me. - I'm doing you a favor. Michael's not even taking a meeting with you. - What do you mean? - A meeting? Group of two, maybe four, five executives in a room. They hear a pitch from a company. It's common business practice. Michael's not gonna be doing that at Nike. Don't fuck with me, Falk. Come on. Okay, wh-what are the bids looking like? It's not about the money. When someone says it's not about the money, I know for sure it's about the money. We decided to stretch the envelope. We want to hear what each company can do to promote Michael. Okay, w-well, then we're thinking along the same lines. That's why I want to have a meeting. Sonny, world-class players don't wear third-rate shoes. Just get me in the room. Sonny, as a friend, it's a waste of time. Off the record: Even though UNC was a Converse school, Michael wore Adidas during practice. Put on Converse right before the game started. The second the final buzzer sounded, - Adidas back on. - (fingers snap) - Bullshit. - Ask Dean. You said it was off the record. I didn't say you had to tell him where you heard it. Trust me, Converse knows it, too. I've already seen Adidas's mock-up presentation. Three words: state of the art. That's four. You're a stalking horse, at best. And a slow, fat stalking horse, so you're not even credible. You know he'll be miserable at Adidas. I mean, it's a shit show over there since Adolf died. Adi, Sonny. He went by Adi. His name was Adolf. I mean, the guy's name was literally Adolf. - He was a good man. - He kept the name. It's Adi. Adi Dassler. Adi-Das. Adidas. - That's what it stands for. - He was in the Hitler Youth. No, he wasn't. Don't say that. I saw a picture of him personally wearing a swastika. The guy had the haircut. - We all have a past. - Look, David, some of us have our past and some of us were Nazis. There's a line. Well, he's dead. We're meeting with the whole family. When's the meeting? Uh, Jordans go to Boston, uh, on Thursday. That's Converse. And then Nuremberg for Adidas on Saturday, and then we're gonna close. - Nuremberg? - Would you cut the shit? It's close to... it's near there. They want to close is the point. What are they offering? I don't see a world where it's south of 250. No fucking way. - SONNY: Let me explain. - No. Listen. Michael Jordan is the player we've been waiting for. Yeah, but you said the same thing about Artis Gilmore last year and Bobby Jones. All right, well, if perfection is the goal, then I'm doomed, right? I-I mean, I'm not gonna hit every shot. How about one shot? A shot, ever. It's part of gambling, Phil. - You don't win every hand. - This isn't a craps table. And we don't have unlimited checks to write... I'm not asking for unlimited. I'm asking for what you already budgeted. - On one player. - Yes. Don't confuse desperation with vision, Sonny. (sighs) We're actually gonna need more than that. For a rookie who's never set foot on an NBA court? That's the literal definition of rookie, yeah. Magic Johnson doesn't have his own shoe. Exactly. I can't justify that to the board, so there's no point - in having this discussion. - All right. Let me put it to you this way. I'm willing to bet my career on Michael Jordan. Oh, come on, man. You asked me what I do here. This is what I do. I find you players. And I fucking feel it this time. Yeah, okay, it's risky. When you were selling sneakers out of the back of your Plymouth, that was risky. It took balls. I mean, that's why we're all here. Don't change that now. Phil, I mean, if you look at him, if you really look at Jordan like I did, you're gonna see exactly what I see. Which is what? The most competitive guy I have ever seen. He is a fucking killer.

I need it in writing. When the offer comes, it'll be in writing. I look forward to seeing it. I can't wait to waste six hours flying out there. Why can't you get a base on the East Coast like a normal company? They love it out here. I'm glad they're happy. Hey, how are the parents? Smart as hell. Don't pull any bullshit on them. They don't want to be sold to. Yeah? Are they home now in Carolina? Don't call them, okay? I'm not fucking kidding. That'd be inappropriate and unprofessional. S-So is outright refusing a meeting. That's just business. Why does Michael want Adidas? Because he likes their tracksuits. (stammers) We'll get him every tracksuit he's ever wanted. He's a kid. He's not thinking about what he will have. He's thinking about what he doesn't have right now. You know what else he wants? - (sighs) What? - Car. Red Mercedes 380SL. But fortunately he's got an extremely savvy advisor who thinks long-term. You know, it's really your humility, David, that's so impressive. You know what I think?

Uh, and believe me, I-I told him multiple times. And-and we got along. He just doesn't like the shoe. He never even worn the shoes. He did say if somebody was to buy him a red Mercedes 380SL, he would sign a shoe contract for life with anybody. Except Nike. - (chuckles) - (laughing) There's nothing cool about Nike.

Later, I'm looking for my favorite line. It's not in there. Then I notice the whole second half of the speech is completely different. What was the line you were looking for? "I have a dream." Come on. Get the fuck out of here. - The "I Have a Dr..." You have that? - Yeah. See, the first half, he noticed the audience wasn't with him.

We need a firm offer. You don't have authorization to make any offer. I understand from his representation that he'll be expecting the entire amount: 250 a year, five years guaranteed. We can't afford that offer. Do you understand how irresponsible that is? That's not. Converse is gonna come in at a hundred. You know the Germans will easily match 250. Sonny, I'm the boss. I'm the CEO of this company, okay? I'm the CEO guy. You do what I tell you to do. - You work for me. - If you want to mean something in the basketball world, you got to spend. Nothing in life is free, Phil. Tell that to the college kids you keep giving our shoes away to for free. That's working. - That's a good idea. - Is it? How do you know it's working? It's theoretical value. It can't be measured. It's a typical Sonny value. And what was my first idea? A high school all-star game. Now every single company has their own branded high school all-star game. I'm giving away these ideas, Phil, free. That's the problem is you see them as your ideas. It's about you and yourself and your ego. There is no self. There's just the nonself. - The nonself? - That's right. Does the Dalai Lama have a grape-colored Porsche, Phil? You fucking asshole, Sonny. Are you trying to be an asshole? Look, all I can do is give you my recommendation. This is the strongest one I've ever had. I'll tell you what. If you want to go start your own company... My own company. That's what I want. - ...I wish you luck. - Start my own company. - Yeah. - You can be impetuous. You can make mistakes. You can be reckless. But let me tell you how we do things at this company. We make careful, strategic, measured, thoughtful decisions with knowable outcomes. Right, knowable and thoughtful and careful. How'd you ever build this place, Phil? Fuck you, Sonny. (sighs) Okay. You know? You did it. You got the meeting. You don't need a firm offer to prep a meeting. So unless I give you the go-ahead Sunday night, you don't have a budget, a Michael Jordan line - or a firm offer to make on Monday. - (sighs) So I'll think about it, and if I change my mind, I'll just cancel it.

So the shoe is a physical manifestation of the individual rather than the individual as emblem of the corporate entity? Something like that.

Well, I told Mr. Falk I would handle it from here. I have a lot of respect for that. Thank you.

Now, we are willing to accept the deal and commit right away but with one minor provision. - Name it. - It's nothing, really. It's so obvious that its omission, I assume, from the term sheet was a clerical error. I'm sure it was. Michael will get a percentage of the revenue of the sale of each shoe that is sold. I'm sorry? Not all Nike shoes, just the ones with his name on them. Oh, well, uh, Mrs. Jordan, so that's not how the business works at all. I mean, I-I understand the assumption, but, um, what... The-the athletes get a licensing fee... in this case, obviously, a groundbreaking fee... but they don't actually participate in the gross sales of the shoe. Because Nike's a public company, so that... it... they can't... That would disrupt the industry, and they wouldn't... they, um... Th-There's a-a whole other set of economics around this. It's very complicated. Yeah, I'm sure it's quite complicated. It's not realistic, but, um... This way, it's cleaner 'cause you know and the family knows exactly what's gonna come in every year... Well, that's not his concern. - Um, okay. Uh-huh. - All right? His concern is that, in order for the shoe to be meaningful, in order for young people, many not of real means, to want to go out and spend the money that they worked all week, two weeks at the mall for, then Michael has to create the meaning in that shoe. His name is on that shoe. Yeah, so actually we think that's a benefit to him because his likeness gets marketed by Nike. No. His likeness, his name is not in any way meaningful to Nike unless he scores 40 points a night, every night, beats Akeem as Rookie of the Year, makes All-Star and All-NBA team. (sighs) Okay, that would be exceptional. And-and, um, you know, it is the NBA, so these are the best of the best. Well, he has to be better. He will win championships, multiple championships, final MVPs. I know my son. All-Star selection, All-Star MVP, Defensive Player of the Year... But, ma'am, with respect, Sidney Moncrief is the Defensive Player of the Year. Adrian Dantley won the scoring title. They're not... Y-You don't get to be Magic and Michael Cooper. - It's basketball. - Yeah, but if he does it, he deserves to be compensated. You eat, we eat. That's all he's asking. That's a fair point, but that's just not how the business works. I mean, they-they invest the capital, then they get the reward, and that's how it goes. Well, maybe that needs to change. Because if he does what I think he's gonna do, what you also think he's gonna do and what Michael knows he's gonna do, then it won't be the NBA promoting my son, I promise you. It'll be the other way around. And in that case, he deserves a piece. Mrs. Jordan, I... I understand what you're saying. I... I actually agree with you. But that's just not how it goes in this life. (sighs) People like your son, people who work for a living, they don't let us own anything. We take the best we can get. And this is a great deal. This is the biggest deal this company has ever offered anyone by far. Michael could blow out his knee next week. Mr. Vaccaro, I agree that the business is unfair. It's unfair to my son. It's unfair to people like you. But every once in a while, someone comes along that's so extraordinary that it forces those reluctant to part with some of that wealth to do so, not out of charity but out of greed, because they are so very special. And even more rare, that person demands to be treated according to their worth because they understand what they are worth. Or their mother does. You purport to know a good deal about my son. You tell me. Is it me who believes in Michael, his name, or am I just a healthy reflection of who he is and what he believes about himself? Hmm? Isn't that why you came to my home? Yes, it is. Okay. Now, I'm gonna put it to you plain once again.
