- Al? Al! Al. Al, Al. Huh! - Okay, but I haven't finished writing the story. "The Ultimate Weapon" by Albert Flinch. Chapter one. Our story begins 30 years from now. He was stationed in Area 51 but he would be back for it because contained within the pages of that book was all he needed to destroy the world. - Al! No, Al. No. - Sorry, but that's all I've got. Petie, I told you I wasn't done. - Al, ahhh. - I can't take this, it's your magic orb. - Al, Al. - Oh you think it'll help me finish writing my story? - Yawwwh. - I'll finish writing it tomorrow, okay? I promise. But for now... - Al? Al! Al? - Petie! Stay right there! - Al! - Look out! - Al, Al! - Petie! No, Petie! No! Petie. No, no. No, Petie, no. Petie! How you doing, buddy, sleep okay? Ow. Ow. Ow. Okay, Hemingway, today is the day. Okay listen to me, Hemingway. You're in charge while I'm gone, okay? Got that? All righty. Give me five. All right. I'm going, I'm going. Hang on, hold your horses. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. I'm going. Okay, I can do this. I can do this. Liv needs me. Livvie. I can do this. I can do. ♪ - Dammit. Albert? Albert, I know you're in there! Albert! - Go away, we're closed. We open when I'm awake. - It's me, Liv. Your offspring. - Oh my God, Livvie, it is you. - So are you gonna let me in, or? - Yeah, please, come in. Come in. Oh, look at you. The last time I saw you, you were, now you're so tall and you look great. Welcome to the Omega Used Bookstore. - So do you live here? - Yeah. I have an apartment out back. - What, this way? - Yeah. Yeah. You ought to check out my UFO section out front. It's award-winning. People come from all over to see it. It's a pretty huge selection, huh? - Do you even get any customers out here? - Yeah, yeah, of course. We get a lot of people heading off area 51 looking for UFO books. I have a great selection out front. And it's probably the best selection in the city, probably United States, you know. Something we're proud of. You know, people come from all over to see it. - So this way? - No, no, no, it's uh, hmmm, okay. - Where's your apartment? - Um, well it's more like a studio apartment, you know. 'Cause you gotta keep the real estate for the business aspect of things, right. - What, this is it? - Yeah. That's more like a bedroom. - This isn't like a bedroom at all. - Yeah well I have a bad back and the cot is actually quite firm and it serves its purpose. - Just a microwave? - It's not just any microwave. I mean look, I could cook a whole turkey if you wanted. Popcorn, defrost, multi purpose. - And where's your fridge? - I don't need one. - What, you drink warm beer? - Yeah well apparently if you drink warm liquids it absorbs the body better so I get drunk faster. - No, it's just gross. - Okay. - What do you do for food? - I manage. I'm breathing, I'm moving, I'm alive. Wait. - Oh my god. Albert! - I like soup. - Clearly. Is this all you eat? - Yeah, but you'd be surprised. I mean there's chicken and beef. Look at this, it's vitamin A and C and D. - Where do you get your water from? You don't have a kitchen. - The sink. - What sink, you don't have a kitchen. - Tada. Welcome to the best drinking water in Lincoln County. - Where's your shower? - See, what the Japanese, they do these freestanding showers where you don't need a tub or a sink, or anything. It's quite efficient. Livvie, please don't go. Stop, Livvie, please, please. Listen. I just want a moment of your time so we could talk and I could see what you've been up to for, it's been seven years. I just wanna know how you been. - No. I am only here because it was mom's dying wish for us to reconnect. But you couldn't even go to her funeral! - I tried. I just, I couldn't. - You tried? What the hell does that mean that you tried? - I have, um... I have an issue with... Listen, okay, um. Okay look, can I just, can you just give me a second of your time? I'm sorry, listen, I failed as a father, I know I did. But I'm here for you now and I just want to take advantage of this moment so you-- - No, no, no. You are not here for me. I am here for you. And now I'm leaving. - No, don't. Wait, you ride a motorcycle? Do you realize how dangerous those things are? You can get killed. - Yeah. And people die from cancer every single day. You cannot tell me what I can and can't do anymore. - Listen, I care for you, okay? I don't want you to get killed. I'm your dad! - No, you are not my dad. You may be my biological father but you are not my dad. I have lived my whole life without you and I certainly do not need you now. Here. Are you gonna take it, or? - I uh... I have a problem going outside. - What? When's the last time you left this bookshop? - About a year? - Holy shit. So that's why you didn't go to mom's funeral. - Hello. - Hey, Dr. Tanner. It's Liv. I know it's been a really long time, but, I have a huge favor to ask you. - Hey there. - Hey. - You work here? - Yeah, yeah. - Pretty sizeable establishment for the middle of nowhere. - Yeah. We get the odd tourist heading out to Area 51. - Name's Sherwood. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, normally you would fist bump me and tell me your name. - Oh, like that. - Poofff. I like to blow things up. - Oh. - Your name? - Uh, Albert, Albert. Have you been here before? - Can't say that I have. - You heading over to Area 51? - I work out that way. - Oh, yeah, what do you do? - I'd tell you, but I'm not going to. Let's just say I'm not at liberty to discuss it for your own safety. - You're messing with me, right? - No. - No? - What I can tell you is that what I do will have a global impact. - Whoah. Sounds important. You know, it's funny you said that, actually, just yesterday I read this book on this, the simple effects of household products and how they have a global impact and how they affect the environment. I think, I'm gonna think it's right up your alley. Anything that sounds interesting to you at all? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I mean for nonfic, for nonfiction it's actually not a bad read. And literally, it's right over here. Now the author, she's an unknown but she's, you could finish this in a-- Okay. Sherwood. Sherwood, Sherwood, Sherwood. That's right about, right about here. Atomic chess? This isn't one of my books. Why would he leave this here? Sherwood, doomsday weapon, atomic chess, all of it, you know? It's like a, it's like a picture that's out of focus and I just can't, I just can't see it, you know? It's there. It's right there on the tip of my tongue but I can't see it. The deja vu, do you guys get deja vu? - The test is already scheduled. - General, there are too many unknown variables. You can't go through with it. - What are you telling me, Dr. Lin? You want me to postpone the test? - I'm saying that it's too powerful. This weapon should never be tested. - So you want me to just put it out there on the battlefield and hope for the best? - No, sir. The Goliath weapon should never be detonated. Once detonated, it'll create an infinite chain reaction that will result in global annihilation. - Why wasn't I told about this until now? - Because Sherwood, Dr. Russell withheld information from me. But according to my calculations, the antimatter explosion will create a black hole that will consume this planet. - That's not possible. - It is now. Sherwood's crazy, general. You need to terminate this project. - Al? Eh? Al? Al! - Not now, buddy. Maybe later, okay? - Al! Al. Al. - Okay, but I haven't finished writing the story. "The Ultimate Weapon" by Albert Flinch. Chapter one. - Name's Sherwood. - But he would be back for it because contained within the pages of that book was all he needed to destroy the world. - What I do will have a global impact. - I can't take this, this is your magic orb. - Al, Al. Al. - Tell you what, I'll finish writing it tomorrow, okay? I promise. - Al, Al! - Petie, Petie! Petie! No, Petie! No! Sherwood! No. No, I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I must be dreaming. I'm not dreaming. Look at me. Tell me, tell me I'm not crazy. Look at me. Am I losing my mind? I'm dreaming, right? This can't be real. It's impossible. Things like this don't happen in real life, right? This is... - Hello? Is anyone here? Albert? Hello? - Oh my god, I thought you were him. - Albert. - He's real. - Excuse me? - He's coming back, what am I gonna do? - Who's coming back? - We gotta tell someone, you gotta help me. - We gotta call - That's why someone called for me. - Homeland Security, FBI, CIA, the military. You name it, we-- - I see, and why is that? - Because I don't have a phone. Is that a phone? - No, it's, that's for my own personal use. Albert, why is it that we need to call Homeland Security? I don't understand. - You're wasting time, he's gonna be back any second. Do you understand? - Who, who is coming? - Sherwood, he needs this book. - Albert, I'm sorry. I'm having a real hard time understanding, okay? I need you to take a deep breath. - I'm breathing. - You're doing great, Albert, all right? I'm a psychologist. I'm Dr. Tanner. Your daughter Liv was -- - Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, I just have to destroy the book. That's it, it's simple. Hey do you have like a match or something? - No, I don't. Albert, why do you wanna burn that book? - So he can't destroy the world, that's why. - Who, who, this Sherwood? - Sherwood, yes. - What makes you think he's gonna destroy the world? - Because that's the plan. That's what I wrote. - I don't understand. You wrote what? - Listen, Sherwood. He's the villain of my story and he was just here in my bookstore, do you get it? No, you don't. Just come. - So just so I have this clear, Sherwood is the name of a character from a story you wrote, and he came here to visit you? - Yes, and he put this book in my store. He hid it in there. - The book you wrote? - No. See, this is Atomic Chess. This is the book that inspired me to write my story. And I also put Atomic Chess into my story and it gives Sherwood the idea to create his weapons. You want more proof? I'll show you proof. Look. But Sherwood knew he might be searched so he decided to hide the book and he had the perfect place. An out of the way bookstore in the middle of nowhere. But he would be back for it because contained within the pages of that book is all he needed to destroy the world. That's the last thing I wrote and that's just what happened. I met Sherwood exactly where the story ends. - And this is why you think your character is real? Because his name is Sherwood also? - Sherwood, yes, and because he left this book in my store. - Albert, it doesn't even mention the name Atomic Chess in your story. - Yeah but I remember that was the name. I'm sure that was the name of the story. I'm sure it was. - Albert, our subconscious can be a powerful force. Sherwood is an uncommon name so I'm sure when you heard it it acted as a conduit, unlocking the memory of the story that you wrote. - But he also had a birthmark shaped like a flame. Just like the character in my story. - Okay, Albert, let's put a pause button on the Sherwood thing for a moment. Let's talk about Liv. - How do you know my daughter? - Albert, I told you. She called me. I'm a psychologist. I'm Dr. Tanner. - A psychologist? - Yes. She's very worried about you. - She's worried about me? - Yes. Albert, I'm not here to judge you, all right? I'm here to help you. Your ex wife recently passed away and your daughter who you haven't even seen in years shows up. I'm sure that's dragged up all sorts of emotions and memories for you. - Yeah. Yeah. - Sometimes, when we have a hard time facing the choices of our actions, we find ways of escaping them. Isolation and alcohol have worked as coping mechanisms for you until Liv came back into your life. And now in order to escape those memories that have resurfaced, you've constructed this fantasy about your character being real and it's very possible that this, this notion about your character destroying the world actually symbolizes how your own world is falling apart. Albert, are you taking these? Albert, this is a very strong and powerful sedative. I mean this could be very well the reason of what you're experiencing right now. Hallucinations are one of the side effects. I wouldn't suggest taking any more of those, all right until we get this sorted out. - Okay. - Deep down, you know there is no way that your character can be real. You know that it's not possible. Look, you can choose to burn this book if you want and stay in this wonderland of a world that you've created. Or you could put that book back, face your problems head on and look forward to the happy things in your life. Like your daughter Liv. - Yeah. Yeah. - I'm proud of you, Albert. You made a big step in the right direction here. Now if it's all right with you I want to stop back tomorrow so we can discuss some next steps. - They pulled the plug on my Goliath project. - Really, that's strange. Did they tell you why? - They said that the project was being terminated and that my services were no longer needed. - It's probably political. Some guys in DC cutting military funding. - I think someone on this base is responsible. - No, it wasn't me. I didn't know anything about it. - You should be more careful. Checkmate. - Relax, okay, relax. It could be anybody. Just a customer, relax. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Oh my god. Hey, welcome back. - Thanks. - Oh, so this is the book you want? - That's the one I was gonna get, yeah. - Yeah well it's not a, it's a terrible read. - Well you're familiar with it, huh? - Fortunately, yeah. It's got terrible reviews, I wouldn't recommend it at all. - I think I'll take my chances. - Okay. Well you know there's no price on it, let me at least get you a price. - I've got 50 dollars, that should cover it. - No, no, I wouldn't wanna cheat you. That's not the policy here. We wanna treat everybody fairly. This just wouldn't make any sense that, yeah so, at the very least let me get you a receipt. - It's not necessary. - You wouldn't happen to have a lighter on you or anything, would you? - No. - Um, well, looks like it's gonna rain out there so let me get you a bag so it doesn't get wet. - I really don't need a bag. - Let me ask you. You wouldn't happen to be from Boulder, Colorado, would you? - Matter of fact, I would. - Oh. - How'd you know? - It's the accent. Let me get some bags, they're out back. Where is he? - Hello? - Hey, hey, what's up? How are you? Hey I brought you some water. I figured you might be thirsty. - No thanks. My book. - Book, oh yeah the book, the book. See, I was there, got the book. But I got the, when I went to get the bag I forgot the book. So I, I brought the water. - Hey look, look, friend. - What? - I'm in a bit of a hurry. If you go get my book, I'll be on my way. - Yeah, okay. It's really good quality water. I highly recommend it. 'Cause the sun will just dry you right up. - Albert. Look, I know what you're trying to do. - You do? - I know you're trying to keep me here. - No, no, no, I'm not trying to keep you here. No, I just took a-- - I mean I get it. You're out here in the middle of nowhere, you got no friends. And along comes this guy. I get it. But I don't have time. You go get my book, I'll be gone. - Yeah, the book. But, triple filtered. It's like really good quality. - Book. - Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Yes. Want a piece of me, huh? Want a piece of me, want a piece of me? I want a piece of you! Want some of this, huh, want some of that? I'll strike you over the head with this. - Albert. - There you are. I was looking for you. - My book. - Yeah, book. I put the book in a bag and it fell on the ground but, bad back. But you know I'll get it for you. - No, I'll get it. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Oh, that's yeah, it's just. - Albert, you don't have a light switch? - Ah, I know who you are, okay? I know you have plans to destroy the world, okay? I'm just gonna keep you here for a couple of days, okay? Just two days and then it'll all blow over. So just hang tight. - Not a very good lock, my friend. - It was an accident. - An accident? Who've you been talking to? - No one. Okay. It was the military. They were here. And they said if you were to come back, to call them so when I went to get the bag for the book I called them, and they're on their way, so. What's wrong? - The water. - Oh, you drank? - You better hope you wake up before I do, friend. - What? Oh. - Albert? - Okay. - Albert? - Okay. All right. Yeah, you're not going anywhere, buddy. You're not going. - Who are you? - I'm no one. I wrote you. - Okay, what are you babbling about? - You're a scientist, you work at Area 51, you created a doomsday weapon. Oh my god. - There is a perfectly logical explanation for this and we will figure it out. Now Albert, I'm gonna give you one last chance to make the right choice. You can either come over here and let me go now or, I can let myself go later and you could pay the consequence. - What, so you can kill millions of people? Not gonna happen. - Albert? - Okay listen. I'm just gonna keep you here for a couple days, okay? Till you can't detonate the weapon. - Albert! - Oh my god. - Watch this, Albert. We're back here, come help me! - Albert? - You don't understand. He admitted it, he came back for the book! - Oh, that's not true. I came here to buy a book and he thinks I'm some sort of character in a story. - He's lying! - Albert, what have you done? - What are you doing, are you crazy? - No, albert, Albert, he is not your character, all right? He's not, he's an innocent person. He's a customer, stop! Albert. - I'm not good at confrontation, okay, please don't make me do this. - Albert, all right. Let's breath, all right. Are you absolutely positive that this is him? - One hundred percent. - Okay. This is what we need to do. I'm gonna go ahead and make a call, all right. I'm gonna call for help. - That's a good idea, all right. - No, no, no, no, no. No, you need to stay here. You need to keep your eyes on him, right? Make sure he doesn't escape. - Yeah. - Right. - Go. Keep looking at him, keep your eyes on him. - Wait, wait, stop. Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop. - What are you doing? - You were gonna call the police, weren't you? - No I wasn't, give me my phone back. - I'm sorry, I'm not gonna let that happen. - Albert, give me my phone. - Listen, listen, listen, just get back, listen to me. - Albert, you need to let him go. - I'm not gonna let him go. If you want, I can't let you leave okay, you know too much. - Take a deep breath. Just take a deep breath. - I'm breathing. - Calm down. - I'm breathing. - It's okay, that's it. - Get down on the floor. Put your hands behind your back, okay? - Oh what's he gonna do, squeeze you to death? - I swear to God! Ah, I'm a crazy person. You deal with crazy people, right? - Deep breath, deep breath, calm down! Calm down! - Come down, put your hands, put your hands behind your back now! - Albert, please, okay. - I'm gonna count to three. - This is just a fantasy, all right? None of this is real! - Get down! One! Okay, put your hands behind your back. - Albert, please, please. Just think about your daughter, okay? - That's exactly what I'm doing. - Think about everything we've been accomplishing, don't throw this away! - I am thinking! Please, Albert please. - Okay. - Albert. - Here we go. - Albert, you've been isolated in this place for far too long, okay? Your mind is playing tricks on you. You have to just remember who you are. Don't lose sight of reality! Albert please. - I'm so sorry. - No, please come back Albert. Stop this! - I need to know where the book is. Did it burn up? - Albert, listen to me. Listen to me. - The book, where's the book, please? - I don't know, I left it on a book somewhere. Albert, none of this is real. You're hurting people, Albert. Don't lose sight of what we've accomplished so far! - Shh, you have to tell me where the book is! - Albert! - Liv, Liv! Liv, please, we're back here! Liv, please help me! Help me, get me out of here, please! - Albert? - Hey, sweety, what are you doing here so soon? It's good to see you again. - My god, what happened to you? You look like shit. - Oh, yeah, yeah. I ran into a wall. I was in a rush and the wall wasn't, and bam. But I'm okay. Nothing some iodine can't fix. - Where's Dr. Tanner? - Who? - Dr. Tanner. - Oh, yeah, yeah. He was here yesterday but he had to go. He hasn't been here since. He had some appointment, something going on. - Well it looks like his car outside. - Uh, well we get a lot of hikers that leave it here. They probably should be charged parking, I'll make a fortune. Who you calling? - I'm calling Dr. Tanner. - I have to go pee. - Hey, Dr. Tanner, it's Liv. I'm at the bookstore. I don't know if you forgot or what happened there but I guess I'll call you later, bye. - See? He's probably busy psychologicizing some nutjob, you know. A ring like that could set him off. But he's not here. So we'll be wasting time waiting for him here. - It's weird though 'cause that looks exactly like his car outside. - Well you know. - I don't know why he would tell me he's gonna be here and not be here. That's really unlike him. - You know, I gotta go tinkle. Just, can you give me a second, I'll be right back. Just hang on to that thought. - Liv, Liv, please help me, I'm back here! No, no, no! Get your fucking hands off of me! No! Liv, help me, I'm back here! Help me! No, no, Albert, no, no! No, Albert, please. - Nine o'clock, okay? Shh, shh. - Albert. I want the cops, now! No! - Albert! What the hell are you doing? - I can explain. It's not what it looks like. He's trying to rob me. I was lying about the wall thing and the face. He came here and so he robbed me and, would you stop? - I am so sorry. - What are you doing, are you crazy? - Get out of here! - He can hurt you. - He's tied up. - Listen, he's insane, okay? He plays with your mind, that's what he does. And he hurt me really bad, I don't want him to hurt you. - Would you please let me go, he's gone crazy! - You have to believe me. - He thinks I'm some sort of character of a book. - Albert! - He's lying. Trust me, he's lying. - Where's Dr. Tanner? - He's not here. - Yes he's got him tied up in the back too. - That's what he does. He's lying. He's playing with your mind, that's what he does. No, listen, do you wanna die? Do you wanna get killed? 'Cause that's what he'll do, truly. - Give me one moment. I'll be right back to untie you. Just give me a second. - Livvie, please! Livvie. - Oh my gosh. Dr. Tanner, are you all right? - No, no, no, no. - Albert, get off me! - Let me explain what's happening. Please, don't fight me. Listen, listen, listen. I didn't wanna tie him up but I had no other choice, he was gonna call the police. - Albert, this has gone too far. You're not well, you can't tie people up. - Livvie. Livvie, stop, please. I don't wanna do this. Stop. He was gonna let Sherwood go. Do you know what that means? - Enough, Albert! - Listen, I just wanna keep Sherwood here until it's safe. That's it, two days tops. Okay? - This is all in your head. None of this is real! - No, listen. You have to believe me right now, okay? Do you realize what will happen if Sherwood's let go? We're dead, all of us, we're dead. - It's all in your head, dammit! - You have to believe me. - Albert, let me go. I don't wanna hurt you but if I have to, I will. Albert. It's your life. If you wanna go to prison, be my guest! You're already in one anyway. I should have never promised mom that I would take care of you. - Listen, listen to me. I didn't mean to hurt either of you. Honestly, I didn't. - I will never understand why mom loved you. I'm sorry. - Argh! - Dr. Tanner, I'm so sorry. I had no idea how far gone he was. - Livvie, don't go. Livvie, please! He'll kill you! Livvie, come back! - Let me out! - Oh my gosh, I am so sorry about all this. I have no clue what's gotten into him. - He's gone crazy! - I'll make it right though, I promise. I don't know how but I will. - Just get me out of here. - Dr. Tanner, can you finish this up? I gotta go check on Albert. Yeah, go ahead, go. - Thank you. - You're gonna be all right, sir. - Oh my god Livvie. Livvie, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Oh my gosh. - Where's Sherwood? - I'm sorry, I had no choice. - Neither do I. - Oh my god. Albert? Albert! Let me out! Albert? Albert? Let me out! Shit. - You're safe now. - Where's the book? - What book? - Atomic Chess. - Are you talking about that book that's supposed to help you destroy the world? - Yes. Where is it? - Look, I don't know where the book is, okay? I really don't, okay? I can't even think clearly right now. But I set you free. - And for that Doc, I thank you. - Oh dear. - Come on. Come on! - Dr. Tanner, Dr. Tanner. What happened to you? Where's Sherwood? - You were right. - Oh my god. Dr. Tanner. Dr. Tanner! - Albert! - He's dead, he's dead. - What? Dr. Tanner? Dr. Tanner, can you hear me? - Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god. Oh my god, he's dead. He's dead. - You killed him. - What? No, it was Sherwood! No, no, no, I can't let you do that. What the hell are you doing with a gun? Do you realize how dangerous those things are? - You just killed someone! - Livvie, I couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a human being. You have to believe me. - I have no idea of what you're capable of. - Livvie, please please listen to me, okay? I have to find that book. I have to protect you. I have no other choice. - Stop it, Albert. - That's all I wanna do, I just wanna protect you, okay? You have to believe me. We have to find that book. That's the only solution, okay? I'm gonna find the book. If you wanna shoot me, go ahead. - Surprise! - What are you doing?! - Get over here! - Let her go! Stop, enough! - The book! - I don't have your book. - Albert. - Here, here, here's your book. - The book! You're gonna regret that, Albert. I can hear you breathing, Albert. I must say I'm a little salty about the pepper spray. You're not trying to leave, are you? Albert, stop hiding. You can't run from the pain. You try to escape life through stories. Sci-fi, thriller, adventure, romance! And fantasy! Look at me, Albert, I'm real! I'm coming for you, Albert! - Ow, ow, ow, oh my god. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Shh, put this over here. I'm so sorry. - Dad, stop worrying about me for two seconds. - You're not afraid of anything, are you? You know when you were a baby girl, you used to drive me insane, you know. You'd find the boundaries and now you're riding motorcycles and carrying guns and wearing a nose ring. - Dad. I get scared too. But I decided a long time ago that I wasn't gonna let fear stop me from doing anything. I didn't want it to get in the way. I didn't want to end up like... - Like me. - But you know, it was those adventure books that we'd read together when I was a kid that taught me that being strong is brave and being brave is okay. - You know I wanted to be like Hemingway and write the most amazing stories and live a life far more adventurous and all that. Ever since Petie died, I just, I couldn't write anymore. - Who's Petie? - He was my... He was my brother. I told you I hadn't finished writing it yet. - Al. Al. - Pete, I can't take this. It's your magic orb. - Al, Al. Awwwh. - Oh, you think it'll help me finish writing my story. - Al! Al, Al, Al. - All right, tell you what. I'll finish writing it tomorrow, okay? But for now you can play with my slingshot, deal? - Al! Al! - Petie, I told you that I'm playing. Go play somewhere else. - Al! Al. - Petie, stop! Don't move. - Al. - I got you. Now slowly turn around. - Al? - That's it. You got it. - Al, Al! No, no, no. - I got you! - Al? - I'm not gonna let you fall. Hold on, I see a rope. - Al, Al? - Petie? Petie! No, Petie! No, Petie! - My parents gave him this ball to, to help him deal with his disability and give him confidence. He'd be alive today if I just finished the damn story. You know? And now it's come back to haunt me. Maybe this is punishment. - No, dad. Don't blame yourself. It's not true. - You know when you were born, my desire to write came back. And I wrote story after story after story. I was just never able to come up with an ending, you know? - Dad. This is one story that you have to find a way to end. - I'm gonna find that book and destroy it. - Here, you might need this. - What, you smoke now too? - Dad, go. - Right. Hang in there, buddy, okay? I'm coming back for you. - Albert. Albert! I know you're right here. There you are. So you're the culprit. - You know when you were born my desire to write came back. And I wrote story after story after story. Livvie! - Dad? Dad, no, he wants you to come. - Please, don't, don't hurt her. Please, come here. It's just between you and me, okay? She has nothing to do with this. - Hand it over. - Dad, what are you doing? You didn't destroy it! - Great story. - No, no, no, stop. Stop! - Maybe we should see if Liv bleeds first of all. - Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop. Okay, take the book, take the book. Take your damn book. You know what? It's about time, this story ends right here! - What are you doing? - Huh, how's that? How's that, huh? How's that feel? - Albert, stop. I don't wanna have to climb back up after I'm done. What are you doing? Seriously, what are you doing? You really think just like tearing the paper is gonna destroy me? Wow. I mean I knew you were dumb, Albert, but. Wow, I don't even have words. Look at this. Oh, oh, oh, my knee. Ow, ooh eh, no. No, that's not gonna work for you. I always thought you were a little bit smarter but I guess I was wrong, huh. Where is it? - Because contained within the pages of that book is all he needed to destroy the world. Because contained within the pages of that book was all he needed to destroy the world. - What are you looking at, Albert? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Huh, maybe this? - Some things. - Oh man. I guess the rabbit beat the tortoise, didn't it? Now I've got the chip. My phone. - It's the phone. That's what he needs to detonate the weapon. - The phone, that's what he needs to detonate the weapon. It's all coming full circle now, isn't it? Ring a bell? Global impact? Yeah, get it? Albert, you still-- You stupid little huss! - Oh my god, - Stop! Look, stop. Stop, stop, look, look, see that? See that, you see that? Listen, listen. - Ah, stop, stop! Albert, stop. You stop. - I'm not gonna give this to you because if I give it, we're all dead. - I'll kill her and I'm not afraid of doing it. - That was, as long as it's functioning, you can carry out your plan. I can prove it. I can prove that you're the character in my story. I can prove it's you. It's just down the street, it's not too far from here. - Outside? - Yeah. Don't move any closer, I swear to god, okay? Let's just head on down there, you first. Don't, I'll crack it in two, I swear to God. Okay, just make your way over there. Stop, no stop! She has nothing to do with this! - No, she has everything to do with this, Albert. She's my insurance. You break my phone, I break your daughter. Go ahead. - Right behind you, okay? - Yeah, so was that. So is the door. - Dad, come on, you can do it. - Just go straight down that way. I'm right behind you. - Come on, dad. - I'm coming. Okay do this. We can do this. - What the hell is going on? Why is Goliath still up and running? - Sorry General, seems like we're having some complications here. - That's pretty obvious. - We have a bit of a problem. Dr. Lin died of a heart attack. - Yes, I'm aware of that. But why is this monstrosity of a weapon still on? - It has to be powered down slowly and in the proper sequence or it'll self-detonate. - Lovely. And how long is that gonna take? - Sherwood and Dr. Lin were the only ones who knew how to. And we can't get a hold of Sherwood but I have his notes and I'll have it figured out soon. - Just get it done, Doctor. And try not to blow us all to kingdom come. - It's straight ahead, through that gate. It's okay sweetie, it's okay. Be careful. What I wanna show you is inside here. Straight ahead. - Us first, huh? - I'm right behind you. Easy! Easy. Right behind you. Straight ahead. - Just remember, Albert. If this is a trick, I will kill little Livvie here. - It's not. It's just straight ahead. Easy, easy! Straight ahead. It's right behind the other side there. - Al? Al! - There, there, that's it. It's that box over there on the other side of this. No, no, what are you doing? - This is just leverage, remember, Albert? Just remember, if that phone goes down, little Livvie goes down after it. - Easy. It's that box right over there. The box right over there. I got it there. Just dust off the top and you'll see what I'm talking about. You see, Sherwood? That's what inspired me to create you. - This is a, it's just a coincidence. Nobody created me. You didn't create me. You didn't create me, nobody created me. - What are you doing, it's dangerous. - Yes. But now that you know the truth, you're free to do what you want. You can choose your own destiny. You don't have to go through with it. You're a genius. You can find a cure for cancer, for world hunger even. - What, world peace? - Yes, world peace. - And be just like you, Albert? Look at you. You're afraid, you're alone, you're scared, you're tired, you're pathetic. - Yeah, I know. I wasted my life. But you know what, it's not too late for me. And it's not too late for you. You're in control now. You could choose your own destiny, your own path. - You're right. Remember that? It contained a microchip to turn my phone into a detonator for a weapon I built. - Oh, thank god. Thank you, thank you. Oh god. Thank god. You okay? Okay, okay. - Be careful. Take it slow. Now come over here. - How's your leg? - It hurts. - I'm so sorry. I'll get you out of here, okay? - No, no, no! - What the hell's happening? - I don't understand. It appears somebody's established an external link. - What the hell does that mean? - Somebody is getting ready to detonate it remotely. - Who, shut it down, now! - I can't. - On your face, it's off. - I know. - Dad, he's got the phone. - Wait, what are you doing? - Uh uh. I said contained, Albert. That's past tense, you should have caught that. - But you're free now. You can do whatever you want with your life. - I know, and I am. Look at this world, Albert. Rape, molestation, war, abuse. People just numbing their pain through sex, drugs, and alcohol. Just so they can keep on existing in misery. But for what reason? I mean why? - Hope. - Hope. Hope. It's the elusive carrot on a stick. It's the dangling of a promise of a better life someday. Someday never comes. Now this is, this is how the story was supposed to end. Albert, you have changed. I'm so proud of you. Unfortunately it's too little, too late. Goodbye, Albert. Albert! No! - Now that was a close call. - No, stop! Don't hurt him! Dad, no! Don't! fight! Stop, please, stop! Hang on, dad! - Livvie, hold on. - Okay. - Hold on! - You're clinging by hope. I told you there was no such thing. - Petie. Petie, I wish I could. I wish I could. No, I can't take this, this is your magic orb. - Al, Al. Al! - Oh, you think it'll help me finish writing my story? - Al! - It's time for your story to end, Albert. One touch of a button and it's the end. - Al. Awwwl. Ahhhh. - Petie? - Arrrrh! Al! Please stay right there. - What the hell? - Al? Al. Al! - Albert! - Dad, dad, it's still counting down! - We did it, Petie. We did it. Are you okay, Livvie? - Yeah I'm fine, just please hurry up. - Okay. - Please. - Okay, I'm coming. Let's get the hell out of here. You ready Livvie? - Yeah, hold on, let me finish this paragraph. - There's no time for reading. - There's always time for a good book. - All righty. - All right. - Ready? - Mhmm, let's go. ♪ I can't fly but I ♪ ♪ I keep finding myself soaring high above this ♪ ♪ I have nothing left ♪ ♪ But I keep on pouring out ♪ ♪ Like I am endless ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ Ow ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ I don't run too fast ♪ ♪ But I'm looking back at miles and miles of past ♪ ♪ I can barely breathe ♪ ♪ But I'm singing out like this is ♪ ♪ Awesome to me ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ Whoah ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ Everybody there see, another miracle ♪ ♪ I can't believe I'm living the impossible ♪ ♪ We are the sighted ♪ ♪ We are the wonder ♪ ♪ Another day of living the impossible ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ Whoah ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ I choose to be alive ♪ ♪ Especially because they all say I should die ♪ ♪ I've wrestled death again ♪ ♪ I know more of his moves now ♪ ♪ And I won't give in ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ Whoah ♪ ♪ Impossible ♪ ♪ Everybody there see, another miracle ♪ ♪ I can't believe I'm living the impossible ♪ ♪ We are decided ♪ ♪ We are the wonder ♪ ♪ Another day of living the impossible ♪ ♪ Everyone in there see, another miracle ♪ ♪ I can't believe I'm living the impossible ♪ ♪ We are decided ♪ ♪ We are the wonder ♪ ♪ Another day of living the impossible ♪ ♪ When I'm awake I wonder ♪ ♪ If I'm gonna be all right ♪ ♪ But too much ♪ - Dr. Tanner?
