RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM - Probably Tuesday, right? - I see, well… - Yeah. - Okay, great. Hi, guys. Everybody doing okay? - Yeah. - Great. Enjoy. You want a refill there? Welcome to the drip. What can I get you? Over here? Pastries, okay. I never want to pour another cup of coffee again. When do you hear back on the chef's job? Soon, I hope. Gray sweater? - Thank you! - What are sisters for? And please… tell me you're not going out with the vitamin guy again. No. Blind date. His name is Joel. Did you not learn your lesson the last time? I have a really good feeling about this. You always do. Go with the skinny jeans. Maybe I want to wear a dress. Look, I really hope this Joel person turns out to be prince charming, but in case he isn't… Do we really need to have this conversation again? I just don't want you to be disappointed when he doesn't ride up on a white horse. He drives a green Lexus, and I won't be disappointed. So says his mother. I just want to be in love. Is that too much to ask? I want what you have. I'm married to the most annoying man on the planet. You love him, though. Yeah. I do. You are a hopeless romantic. You don't have a cat, do you? Because my mom assured me you don't have cats. No cats. I'm guessing you're not a cat person? - No. - A dog person. - No. - So should we order? I'm starving. Not really familiar with this restaurant. - Any suggestions? - Curry. Best in town. I don't eat Indian. - The three cheese pizza's good. - Lactose intolerant. - Pasta? - The thing is… the last time I had pasta was with my wife. Your… wife? I mean, my ex-wife. Are you all right? Well, I don't know if it's the best work, but definitely staged a lot of growth, and I don't know how long it took him, but… - It seems like… - Thank you so much for coming. I'm so glad that you're here. Mr. Madsen is one of the pioneers of high dynamic range photography, and we hope that you enjoy his work. So Heath, of all your photos, what's your favorite? I'd like to think I haven't taken it yet. Does that mean we can expect a new series soon? I'm always waiting for that perfect moment where you see something, and it just takes your breath away. And you say to yourself, "I'll take it." Thank you all so much for coming out. I appreciate it. Ladies and gentlemen, Heath Madsen. Bravo, bravo! Let's go. So good of you to come. Thank you. Hi! Good, isn't he? First show in years. Bit of a shame it's a retrospective. - I have this photo. - Really? I never knew who took it. I'm sure you're mistaken. No, no, it's the same photo. Mine's a little bit smaller, but it's the same. Dear Mr. Madsen, we have never met, but I stumbled on your show tonight and absolutely loved it. Just wanted to say that I've always admired your high dynamic range photography and look forward to your next release. One of your fans, Samantha hart. Dear Samantha, thank you so much for your kind words. I'm sorry we didn't have a chance to talk in person. Next time, don't hesitate to reach out. By the way, call me Heath. Hi, Heath. You can call me Sam. Now that we're on a first-name basis, I should confess that I own a small version of your Horse Meadow. Horse meadow is my personal favorite, and you may be the only one who shares the same view. Really looking forward to meeting you if/when we actually meet. Okay, well, how do you feel about Chicago next month? - Yeah… I don't think so. - Why not? The retrospective went great! Exclamation point. Superb, in fact. Yeah, if you don't mind being in a room full of old photos with a washed-up photographer babbling about nothing. You're not washed up. - Well, thanks. - We need to concentrate on your brand, on the Heath Madsen brand. Why do I have to be a brand? Everyone's a brand! Dad, you're home! Hey, buddy. Good to see you. Donny! Celeste. I'll… be at the inn if you need me. We're good. Thank you, Celeste. Okay. As always, you are the best. Best. Right. Hi, Heath. I was just admiring my Horse Meadow. Do you mind telling me where it was taken? Hi, Sam. It's not far from my home, a very special place where I spent a lot of time with my late wife and son. Dear Heath, I'm so sorry about your wife. Your bio didn't mention a son. Does he share your interest in photography? His name is Donny, age 12. He does not have the photography "bug" but is very interested in computers, business, and finance. Enough about us… tell us about you. Heath, I'm a chef. Don't laugh… my specialty is potpies. Potpies are no laughing matter… I love them. Maybe one day, you'll get a chance to sample my work. Any plans for more L.A. shows? Sam, no plans for L.A., but I am showing here next week. Would you consider coming out for it? I could send you a ticket and book you a room at the local hotel. That way, you can see the show and maybe honor us with one of your potpies. It's the least I can do for my Horse Meadow enthusiast. What do you think? Triple latte, extra foam, and I saved you the last cinnamon muffin. And we're celebrating why? Because… I met someone. What? When? A little while ago. And you waited this long to tell me. You know that photo in my living room? - He took it. - Starving artist. He's not starving. He's… thoughtful, talented, gorgeous. Even his name is perfect. Heath Madsen. Heath like… Wuthering Heights Heath? Is that not the most romantic name - you've ever heard? - What's his real name? That is his real name. And he has this amazing son. You should hear the way he talks about him. - So he's married. - His wife died three years ago. A widower. That could work. They have a high rate of remarriage. You're awful. I'm practical. So… when do I get to interrogate him? Actually, he's from out of town. How far out of town? I don't know… 500 miles? Where'd you meet? Okay, so we haven't technically met. But we did make eye contact, and we've been emailing. - Eye contact? - He's got this show coming up, so he's booking me a hotel room, and he sent me a ticket. That's a train ticket. Tell me you're not going. - Full house. - I think you're cheating. - You're thinking wrong. - I was thinking. Maybe you should have some of your buddies over from school. It's been a long time. Funny. I was thinking the same thing. - Having someone over. - Some of the guys? - No, it's a her. - Okay, Donny. - We've talked about this. - I just think it wouldn't hurt to meet someone new, you know, get out there again. - I've been out there, Donny. - If this is about Celeste, I urge you to keep that strictly business. It is strictly business. - Does she know that? - Who are you? Someone who's looking out for you, Heath. What happened to "dad"? Sam? Sorry I'm late. There was a last-minute snafu with the car. - Donny Madsen. - Donny! I heard so much about you from your dad. I hope your ride here was satisfactory. Tulips. From my dad. They're your favorite, right? Yes, thank you. That's very thoughtful. Sorry he couldn't be here in person. He got tied up in a project. He's painting. I didn't know he was a painter too. Can I take your bags? - It's okay, I got it. - I insist. Sam, this is my driver, Jackson. Nice to meet you. Thank you. Okay. Okay… Gotta go. Good luck. This must be Sam. I'm May. I take care of the house, the boys, stray cats… whoever turns up. Welcome. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. Heath will be here any minute. It's such a beautiful place. It's just the three of us here, but we like it. Hi. Hello. Well, I'm here. You sure are. - Do we know each other? - What? I'm sorry, I just… I take it we met somewhere? We've been emailing. You got me a train ticket. You got me a hotel room. Dad, remember that lady I told you about from your website? No. Well… this is her. Sam. She's an Aquarius, a chef, never been married, no kids, likes tulips and black licorice. And her specialty is chicken potpies. - Isn't that right, Sam? - I'm sorry. I don't quite know how to tell you this, but I didn't email you. I'm not sure I understand… Someone else runs my website. Please tell me I haven't been pouring my heart out to a sixth grader. Seventh grade. I skipped a year. I should go. I'll deal with you later. Both of you. Look, I am so sorry. He misses his mother. You know, he's never taken it this far. He must really like you. Why am I not reassured? Look, you can't walk back. At least let me drive you into town and get you that hotel room. Thank you, but the only room I'm going to is my own. And I'm never coming out. Well, that's the thing… Next train out isn't till tomorrow. Where do I sit… the back? Here we go. Get that out of the way. Yeah. Okay. Got it all in there. Thank you. That sticks sometimes. Here. Thank you. I cannot believe they don't have a room. Somehow I can. My kid's grounded for life. It's okay. You can go. I'll just… I'll sleep in the lobby tonight. You're not sleeping in the lobby. You're staying at the house. Okay? There's plenty of room. It's one night. I insist. Hey, as long as we're in town, you mind if I grab a few things? - Sure. - Great. All right. Shouldn't you lock that? Beauty of a small town… no crime. Come on. It's usually really quiet around here. Are all these people here for your show? Yeah. What were they thinking? More importantly, what was I thinking? What do you mean? Well, my rep promised a new series. The money's gonna go to the kids' art center. That's really nice. It would be if I had a new series. You don't? Well, truth is, I haven't picked up my camera in a long time. Just haven't felt anything in a while. What about your paintings? What paintings? Donny said you were a painter. Yeah, yeah. Houses, barns, garages. Stuff to keep me busy. Is that one-ply or two? Two. You know… this is like one of my dates. Yes, Roz, I'm still alive. For now. I… okay. I'll call you later. Coroner? My sister. She's convinced you're either a stalker or an ex-con. That's my track record. - What's up, Mr. Madsen? - 'Sup, Robbie? $74.21. I can't believe this. I forgot my wallet in my other pants. Exactly like one of my dates. I'm sorry, Mr. Madsen. Here. Thank you. I'll pay you back. There you are, Heath! I've been looking all over for you. Why… aren't you working? You've got a big show coming up. Celeste, this is… - Samantha. - Samantha. Celeste Jeffers-Johnson. Are you a… friend of Heath's? I'm really more of a friend of Donny's. How sweet. Okay, so tonight can come by and you can show me some prints? Yeah, tonight's not good. You've got a show on Sunday! Exclamation point. Believe me, I know. Please tell me you've got something. How do you feel about recycling? I have reps coming in from all the major markets, and they're expecting to see a new series, Heath. - Okay? - I'll think of something. It's London. To be continued… Dot, dot, dot. Hello? Wanna grab lunch? You won't have to pay here. I have a tab. Sorry about forgetting your name. It's okay. Well, now you won't feel bad when you forget mine. I wish I could forget your name, but unfortunately, Wuthering Heights is kind of my favorite book, so… weren't you named after Heathcliff, the character in the book? No, the candy bar. My mom was eating a Heath bar when she met my dad. Well, that's… romantic, I guess. Jackson, what's the special? Well, if I told you, it wouldn't be special, now, would it? - Hey, Sam. - Hi! This is my place. How do you know her name? Jackson picked me up at the train station today. - You were in on this too? - Hey, take it up with Donny. I was just the wheelman. Anyway, it looks like the two of you are hitting it off nicely? She's only here until tomorrow morning. Well, you should come by for karaoke. Maybe you can even get him to sing. Have you ever heard the cry of a wounded coyote? You're a sad little man. Hey, Jackson, just so you know, she's a chef, so you should probably apologize in advance… - Okay. - For this. Just so you know, your tab just came due. And Millie called in sick, - so I'm short a waitress. - No, no… just for lunch rush. It'll only be 45 minutes - or an hour, tops. - I burned a table of six last time, or have you forgotten? No. I don't think anyone will ever forget that. Okay. I'll do it. I totally get what Donny sees in you. Hi, guys. Okay, one special and one chicken and fries. Let me know if you need anything else, okay? Those nachos okay, guys? Good. I'll be with you guys in just a second. All right, you had the ribs, right? - Thanks. Yeah. - Okay, enjoy. Hey, guys! Welcome to Jackson's. Been here once or twice? - You're new. - Yeah. Hey, guys. There is your mustard. It's so amazing, right? Killer sandwich. All right, here I am to warm up your coffee. - All right. - Great. Let's make this happen. Let's get you caffeinated so you can enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks for helping out Jackson. Yeah, sure, it was… it was actually pretty fun. - Excuse me. - Yes. I have that exact same sweater. Really? I love it. I just bought it. 10 bucks. You're kidding. I paid 70 for mine. Well, you need to check out this van down the street. This guy's selling women's clothes really cheap. That's crazy. I know. Right out of a suitcase. The inn was full. Well, welcome back. Didn't you have a suitcase? It was stolen from the back of his truck. $1,000 compressor back there. They didn't take that. 'Course he didn't. 'Cause there's no crime here. Well, come on in. I'll show you the guest room. Is that paint? Yep. Okay. - I'll go with them. - Oh, no, you won't. Donny, I know we've had a rough go of things, but what you did here today is not okay. I didn't do it for me. I did it for us. I know you think that, pal, but we're doing okay. We don't need anybody else to be a family. But she's perfect for you. - We don't even know her. - I do. What's that? Nothing. Research. Research? They're the ladies who contacted your website. Tell me no one else is showing up here. - They're not. - Okay. - No computer for a month. - Dad! It was excruciating. He had no idea who I was. Can't really say that I'm surprised. Anything other than that? Other than that, he's named after a candy bar, and I'm pretty sure he has a girlfriend. Sam, it's me. I found some stuff for you to wear. I'll put it by the door. I'm making you a potpie to say I'm sorry. An apology pie, huh? All right, I'm gonna have you scoot over. Go on, scoot. Okay, so… the key to success in this situation is the crust. The best thing about a potpie is it's a comfort food, and you can really put anything in it you like. Okay. You take over. - Storm's coming. - Perfect. Speaking of storms, there's this Celeste Jeffers-Johnson person. She shows up everywhere. I'm sure you've already ran into her like six times. Once. He thinks it's business, but she has an agenda. She's already talked him into a dinner, two long lunches, and a double cappuccino. He should be with someone like you. I'm afraid that's not gonna happen. Donny… I'm sorry. Hey, did you know that they had potpies in ancient Rome? Really? And in old England, when the king would cut into the crust, a live bird would fly out. Gross! Donny. You're so silly. We're not gonna get any cooking done like this. You have flour on your face. - Stop! - You gotta get it off. All right, you keep stirring that. Okay. That's the sauce that's gonna make this potpie delicious. It's looking really good. I took care of Heath when he was a kid. And now Donny and I are both raising him. As I recall, your last husband threw food at the wall. Or was that husband number two? No. That was Tom. How many husbands have you had? - Three. - She's working on number four. - Eddie. - That reminds me. I owe him a text. You said no phones at the table except for emergencies. This qualifies. He was A.T.D. At the doctor. See you A.T.S.C. See you at the senior center. - Oh, no. - What's wrong? Eddie says the highway washed out again. How bad? Shut down in both directions. Which highway? The one from town to the train station - and everywhere else. - But they'll clear it, right? Well, could take a couple days. Last time it took a week. Okay. But there's gotta be another way out of town. Not without a boat. So you're saying I'm stuck here? Oh, no. I'm still here. Good morning! Good morning. Would you like some coffee? Yeah. That would be great. - How do you take it? - Black. Thank you. You're welcome. And… yes. The road is still closed. Trust me, in 20 years, you'll be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than the things you did. One can only hope. I forgot! I have some things for you. What's all this? This is too much. Tell Donny I can't accept these. Donny's in school. And you can accept these. They're from Heath. They are? He went over there this morning. Had the owner come in, open the shop early. I shouldn't interfere. But I have already, so… why stop now? Sit down. I love Heath. He's like a son to me. But he's stuck. You know, I'm the type that just keeps getting married until I get it right, but not Heath. He was just gonna do it once, and… now he has to start over. But let's face it. He's a guy. And, you know, they're all really pretty clueless. So… you know, just give him another chance. Sorry to interrupt. Trust me, you're not. I wanted to thank you for the clothes. They're nicer than the ones I came with. Well, I had some help picking them out. Although, the pink scarf… totally me. So this is your studio, huh? Yep. This is where the magic happens. Or at least used to. These are really good. These are really good. Thanks. They were better when I took 'em. Long time ago. But enough about my glory days. I'm worried about Donny. - He's a great kid. - That's just it. I want him to spend more time being a kid and less time trying to find me a wife. - He wants you to be happy. - I'm not unhappy. That's the same, right? I think he just misses things the way they were. I was like that after my dad left. All I wanted was my family back. But Donny's smart. He'll be okay. Are you happy? I'm not unhappy. I'm sorry this thing turned out so badly. It's okay. It's not a total loss. I've been waiting pretty much my whole life for a guy on a white horse to come along, and now, because of you, I finally realized he doesn't exist. So I ruined your romantic dreams, huh? Yeah! But that's good. - How's that good? - Well… I need to accept the fact that I'm alone and I may always be alone, and that's okay. So those are your choices… being alone or a guy on a white horse? Mr. Heath Madsen. - Hello, Celeste. - Hello! - Hello. - Hi. I see you're wearing the new clothes. Heath, I told you they'd fit. He thought you were a little bigger. I didn't say bigger. I said taller. To-ma-to, to-mah-to. News bulletin… there's interest from London. Clive Clark is in the States and interested in coming to your show. You're kidding. Although the road will have to open up first, which it will, if I have to dig it myself. All right, where are they? Show me the prints. And do not tell me they're not ready yet. Depends what you mean by ready. Oh, man. - I have an idea of… - Okay. What I want to accomplish, and the… well… what I considered the road to nowhere. I think another retrospective would work. Another retrospective! Come with me. Where are we going? I want you to meet somebody. Okay. If he's not in eighth grade and doesn't have a camera, I'm in. Hi, everyone. - This is Sam. - The young lady Donny picked out. Donny has impeccable taste. - Does everyone know? - And then some. And may I just say you look even better in person. Sam, this gentleman is Eddie. And I use the word gentleman loosely. - And this is Jim. - My pleasure. So how do you like our hangout? It's great. Heath fixed it up. Used to be a real dump. Worked three weeks on it, night and day. Never asked for a penny. Here. I saved you a couple of seats up front. - Thanks. - Nice meeting you in person. You too. Thank you. - So that's number four. - That's him. I approve. Don't leak this, but… he asked me on a Barefoot Cruise to Mexico. How romantic. - When do you set sail? - That's a good question. I don't think it's a good time to leave the boys. Why not? Donny seems so mature. It's not Donny I'm worried about… it's Heath. By the time I get back, that shark will have turned my room into an art gallery. - What? - Celeste Jeffers-Johnson. She's the type of person who gets what she wants, no matter what it takes. - Am I right? - I don't know her very well, but she seems like a nice person. And by nice, I mean pretentious, and by person I mean… - bingo! - What? Yes, sir! Every time! Jim's won again! Exactly. I pick up food once a week for the boys. They really love it. I… Donny? Why aren't you in school? I got out early, remember? - And you came here? - It's business. Excellent news. I brought our pie samples to Jackson, and he's putting them on the menu. - It's so good. - Busy weekend. He'll take as many as we can make. So we're a "we" now? We'll talk percentages later. Donny says that you can deliver - 4 dozen pies by tomorrow? - What? I'll have the tins and vegetables delivered to our house by the end of the business day. I'm still working a deal for the chickens. This would go a lot faster if we could invite some kids over to help us. We don't need anyone else. Overhead. I hate to break it to you, but you're not a 40-year-old CEO. Yet. Donny… you know, when I was your age, my parents got divorced. My mom was really sad, and my sister was a mess, and I felt like I had to take care of them. - Did you? - Yeah. I tried. Cooked them dinner every night. That's actually how I learned to cook. But I spent all of my time worrying about grownup stuff. Stopped hanging out with my friends, stopped being a kid. That doesn't sound so bad. The thing is, you really only get one chance at being a kid. Like a limited offer. Yeah. Mind if I snap a few shots? Light's perfect. For marketing your pies. I guess not. What do you want me to do? No, just keep doing what you're doing. It's great. Just be natural. Seriously. Okay. You look right at home. Look how pretty. Guys, look. Aren't they pretty? Look, look, look. - You did such a good job. - You're geniuses. So glad we got help. We only have, like, another hundred to do? - Yeah, just another thousand. - I'll put a little more on. Did you just toss flour on him? It's getting kind of brown. These can go in the pot. Okay. Hey, guys. Hey, Jared. How you doing, Tommy? You guys need some help? Yeah, that'd be great. - Like this? - Okay, just move it forward on the knife and then just… like that, so you don't actually have to leave the board. Thank you. I haven't seen Donny like that in… in a while. Thanks. Are you kidding me? I had a great time. Used to have those kids over every day before… I don't know how you managed it, but… I appreciate it. I really didn't do anything. Except bake a pie or two. Or 48. You know, they were good. Really good. You ever think about opening a restaurant? I thought about it. Potpie cafe. I have all these recipes. Mediterranean, Greek olive, vegan, sweet and sour chicken. Fig. Of course, chocolate. But my sister talked me out of it. She said I was being unrealistic. I'm a dreamer. Is this the same sister that thought I was a stalker or an ex-con? The very same. Although, in my case, she's probably right. There's too much risk. It's much easier just to work in someone else's restaurant. What about an online business? That's less risky. Actually, it was an online situation that got me here, so I'm gonna have to say no on that one. I'm serious. It'll be like a fruit of the month club, but only potpies. So you would subscribe to something called the potpie of the month club? Yeah. I would. And you wouldn't be embarrassed about it? I might use an alias. Here. Thank you. He's not as bad as I thought. Excuse me, but we have a one-time humiliation rule in our family. I'm not saying anything's gonna happen. Oh, no. - You like him! - No. And even if I was starting to semi-think he was okay, I'm coming home as soon as the road opens. Get off… oh, man. - Come on. - I got news. The road is open. And that means tourists. - Which means cha-ching! - That's great. - Is it? - Why wouldn't it be? Well, I guess your camera must have taken this picture of Sam all by itself. What can I say? The camera loves her. Just the camera? You haven't taken pictures like this in… a very long time, man. What's your point? My point is that you're starting to feel something. Yeah, that would be annoyance, so… why don't you just get out of here and let me sleep? Okay. So this whole thing may have started off a little sketchy. Yes, she was chosen by a 12-year-old. Yes, she thought you were someone else. But she's here, and she came all the way here for you. Yeah. And… now she's leaving 'cause of me. Ask her to stay the weekend. - I can't. - Always an excuse. Donny, work, no work. Will you just get up and help me with these pies, huh? - Anything else? - Yeah. Put on a different shirt, pull yourself together, and, for goodness sakes, at least give her a good-bye kiss. Sam? I'll be right there. Did I wake you? Why would you say that? Your shirt's on backwards. You have a little piece of toilet paper stuck to your… Yeah. I tried shaving. Didn't work out so well. It's two-ply, I assume? You'd assume correctly. So… was there anything else? Yeah, I got some news. Jackson came by. He said the pies look amazing. Good. One other thing. There's this place I wanna show you. Word on the street is you're headed to the meadow. Yeah? What street is that? Can I help? Don't you have school to get ready for or something? I've got plenty of time. Come on, let me prep the mule. Done it a million times. Go, get your gear. All right. Don't top it off. I already put gas in. Got it. There's a place I want to show you. So, where we going? You'll find out. Here we go! First time I came up here was with my dad. He worked for the forest service and, we used to camp out under the stars. - That sounds really nice. - Yeah, it was. You know, I thought I'd follow in his footsteps. I got my first camera, and that was it. Look familiar? It's where I took that photo. It's beautiful. Yeah, I thought you should see it in person. Of course, there's no horse now. I haven't been up here in a long time. Too long. I was a struggling artist when I took that photo. And now? Well, I'm still a struggling artist. - That's disturbing. - It really is. Thanks. Maybe this'll be your comeback. The road to fame and fortune. Let's hope not. It didn't work out so well the first time. What do you mean? Let's just say I didn't like the person I became. When Donny was born, I decided to put the people I love first. We used to make jewelry out of these. What are they? - Porcupine quills. - Sounds painful. I made a necklace for my third grade girlfriend out of these quills. As I recall, she required medical attention. At least you left an impression. Yeah, probably some scarring too. Been there, minus the jewelry. So you've had dates worse than this? Not that this is a date. I've had worse just this month. There was Voldemort, and then this guy who sold hair products out of his car. And Joel… although he was really more of an incident. Yeah, well, at least you're braver than I am. You're out there. At least you don't get invited to showers. I generally shower alone. Wedding showers. Baby showers. And then, when every single person I've ever met is married, they start renewing their vows. Is that really necessary? How dare they? Thank you. Well, they're not back yet. That's a good sign. Yep. Or a bad sign. It's all good. Trust me. So what's with you and Eddie and that Barefoot Cruise? - That a done deal yet? - How do you know about that? Eddie asked me about tickets. I told him I could get him upgrades. You are unbelievable. Okay, now just trust me, all right? There it is. Now, just turn… turn away. Turn away… and just look back at me. Don't even think… there it is. Now just turn slowly towards the camera. Okay. And just look at me in the eyes. Don't even worry about a smile or anything… just what's natural. That's it. Nice. Beautiful. That's it. See? Fantastic. I don't know what I'm doing. No, you're a natural. It'll be dark soon. We should head back. I had a really good time. Thanks for bringing me here. I'm glad I did. What the… It's impossible. I just filled it up. Maybe there's a leak. No. No leak. I never should have let him near it. - Him? - Donny. He siphoned the gas. Just enough to leave us stranded. That kid's relentless. Well, good thing I brought my gas can. Empty… gas can. There's no signal. He thought of that too. Relentless, but kind of a genius. It's also a 15-mile hike back tomorrow. Well, let's make camp. It's really getting late. Relax. You know dad. He's at home in the woods. Even if he has to stay overnight. Why would he have to stay overnight? Who knows? What did you do? I may have siphoned a little gas. Donny! I packed provisions. They have everything they need. Well, I hope you have everything you need in your room, where you'll be living for the next year. Old Halloween candy. I'm sorry about this. I don't mind. I love licorice. Were these straws always this small? I'm pretty sure you grew. I guess so. Yeah, I forgot how nice camping can be. Well, except for the… the hard ground, the lack of indoor plumbing, and TV. It's nice. You can have the sleeping bag if you want it. No, I'm good. Thanks. You're welcome. Heath's in the studio, I hope. He's sleeping. I'll tell him you came by. Cheerio. - Well, just wake him. - He's not here. - Well, where is he? - Camping. - Camping? Where? - We don't know. He doesn't go anywhere without telling you. Isn't that right, Donny? Okay. They went to the meadow. They? Oh, don't tell me he's with that person who lost her clothes. - Wait, let me go get them. - Don't trouble yourselves. I'll get them. Hey. Good morning. Mornin'. How long have you been up? Not long. - How'd you sleep? - Pretty good. Thank you. Why does Donny think that we'd be perfect for each other? Probably because he's 12. I think he's just afraid I'm gonna end up with Celeste. Are you? I could never be with somebody that Donny doesn't like. We should… we should probably head back. Sometimes things can start one way and end up another, right? I'm just gonna say this. I want us to be more than friends. You do? Yeah. I know I'm not exactly what you came here for, and I don't have a white horse. You do drive a white bronco. Celeste. Thank goodness you're all right. And you're both here. I thought you would have left by now. Just waiting on the road to open. Well, it opened yesterday. - What? - Heath didn't tell you? I didn't know. Well, now you know. Anyway… gasp… guess who I spoke to? Clive Clark. If he likes what he sees, he will have you in one-man shows all over Europe. This is a big break. For both of us. The implications are just enormous. All right. Well, I don't need to remind you that we'll be setting up tonight. You don't, but you will. Well, I can drive Sam to the train while you work. That won't be necessary. No, it's no trouble at all. Sam's staying for the show. Aren't you? - I am. - Yep? Great. The more the merrier. See you tonight. - Drive safe. - Of course. You're back. I was worried. Worried you didn't pack enough candy bars? - Are you mad? - I should be. But you're not, right? Sam, our pies sold out at Jackson's. They need more inventory asap. Guess we're in the pie business. You took her to the meadow. Yep. You haven't been up there in a long time. Yeah. Guess you must be happy. That's… I don't know how you girls roped me into this, but I kind of like it. You better. We're gonna be here all day. Hey, Jackson. It is really hopping in here. - Hey, Jamie, couple sodas. - All right. So when are you gonna show me your photos? At the show, with everyone else. Special treatment… thanks a lot. All right, welcome to karaoke night at Jackson's griddle. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Now, I couldn't help but notice that among us we have the town's worst singer. My very good friend, Mr. Heath Madsen. So let's bring him up with a big round of applause. Heath Madsen. All right. All right. Thanks, pal. Thank you. Thanks. All right, Heath! I mean, we may have a winner after all. All right, who's ready to get up here next? Notice the eye contact there? That was awful. I loved it, thank you. Bravo, bravo. Thanks, Celeste. We have a show to set up for. Ticktock. We're just gonna grab a bite to eat first. Well, I've got some edamame and kale chips at the gallery. It's okay, go ahead. - I'll be fine. - You sure? Yeah, I'll be great. I'll see you back at the house. Okay. Yeah, I've known Heath my whole life. I gotta say, you bring out a side of him that I have not seen… in a very long time. He's different than I thought. Well, that's good, right? You know, I don't think he would mind if you wanted to stay a little longer. Or a lot longer. You know, I do have a job to get back to. That coffee's not gonna pour itself. You don't know how things are gonna shake out. I mean, when I told him yesterday the road was open, I thought for sure you'd be long gone. Wait, you told him yesterday? Yeah, yesterday morning, when I came to pick up all the pies. And speaking of pies, I hear that you and "The Donald" are starting an Internet business. Potpie of the month club. Potpie of the… I love that. - You do? - I would subscribe to that. - Get out. - No, that's a great idea. Thank you. Are you gonna do wholesale? For you, Jackson, the world. The world. Potpie of the month club. That is a genius idea. You could do Mexican, you could do Italian. They're… brilliant. Exclamation point. Why does that sound more like a question mark? The photography is fabulous. American retro. I love it. I'm just a little… surprised at the subject. You know, Celeste, Donny thinks I'm giving you mixed messages. Does he? I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong idea. But the truth is, I am having feelings for Sam. Heath, you barely know her. Well, it's like these photos. Just kind of happened. Well, I'm sure you're just… caught up in the moment, that's all. No. No, it's more than that. Look, I'm not gonna lie. I think that we make a good team, and I'd hoped… well, I guess that's pretty obvious. I've probably made an idiot of myself. No. No, not at all. It wouldn't be the first time. All right, well, let's hang these brilliant things. Okay. Come on, come on. Come on, hurry up, I wanna play. - Come back over here. - Yes! - Oh, dude! - See? - I found it! - The mother lode! Oh, yeah. You know… Heath can fend for himself. I'm telling Eddie we're going on that cruise. You go, girl. He makes me… so happy. I didn't know what I was looking for until now. What are you looking for? Someone I can share a bowl of popcorn with. Popcorn. It's so romantic. I think we did it. Looks perfect. See, we do make a good team. Yeah, we do. What's… this? Actually, I made that for… come on, it'll make up for breaking my heart. I suppose I could make another. Oh, goody. But whatever you do, do not wear it. Why not? Because the last person I made one for ended up in the emergency room. It'll just be a conversation piece. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. This is the closest Anna has gotten to the herd, and she's taken a chance in doing so. Her acceptance by the mustangs, especially roughhouse, has taken many long weeks to establish. Now she slips closer to the horses at the edge of the pasturage. She risks it all. Suddenly Missy, the four-year-old mare, alerts to Anna's presence. Missy swivels her ears forward and steps toward Anna, putting herself between her foal Alfonse and the human interloper. This is the moment of truth for Anna and all the work she's done. Meanwhile, across the valley, Nick watches Nola in the corral. The mustang is completely healed but doesn't want to leave yet. There are several possibilities why, most likely, that Nola likes the easy food and water that's been available. Hi. Hi. So how'd it go? Good, I think. That's great. What's next? We go see your show. I mean after that. - There's an after? - I hope so. Isn't there? I hope so too. I'm going to shake a few hands, sell a few prints, and we can figure this out. I can come and see you or… or you can stay. Sam, we need to confab about P-P-O-T-M-C. And he's back. P-P-O… what? Potpie of the month club. Are we actually gonna call it that? So we are a "we". I guess we are. I have a good feeling about this. Let's go. Potpie of the month club. They're all of me. Really? I-I hadn't noticed. What do you think? I think you're crazy. You look beautiful. Go ahead, check 'em out. It's gonna be a sellout. You are back. I thought I told you not to wear that. Don't be silly, they're fabulous. I've got nothing but compliments. Here, there's a few people I want you to meet. This quote-unquote "gentleman" is Clive Clark. So nice to meet you. Very impressive work. It's Americana at its finest. And I am enchanted with your model. Me too. Okay, thank you! Everyone, thank you so much for coming and supporting the children's art center. We really appreciate it. And I am thrilled to announce that the very prestigious Clive Clark gallery in London has just offered our very own Heath Madsen a solo show. Amazing, right? In fact, he leaves for the U.K. Tomorrow, and I will be stuck to him like glue. Heath, I would love to talk with you about some of the ideas I have for how we might do this when you get to London. Fantastic news. Enjoying yourself? Gorgeous, isn't it? Heath made it for me. This really is a second chance for him. I know. It's really wonderful. Yes. And the last thing he needs is to be tied down or distracted. So I hope you've had fun on your holiday, but he's done now. So you can go back to wherever it is you came from. I don't think that's any of your business. He lied to you about the road to get you to stay here. What, you think that's because he fell in love with you in five minutes? No, silly. That's because he needed you for the pictures. And they are magnificent. Really, mission accomplished. We'll make sure you get to take home a signed original. I think it would really help showcase the pieces in a more individual light. Heath. To London. And beyond. Think my hair is caught in this clasp. Would you get it? - I told you not to wear this. - I know. - It's still caught. - Stand still. You're not getting it. - What was that? - Heath. We were celebrating. I'm dying to know: Which is your favorite photo? If you only got to choose one. That one. Hey! Sorry, sister. What? Never mind. Do you have a driver's license? Totally. You've reached Sam's phone. Please leave a message. Hey, Sam, it's Heath again. Call me. Hey! Congratulations, man. I heard you sold out. Have you seen Sam? She isn't answering her phone. No, but Donny was in here looking for her too. Is everything all right? She's not back at the house. - What did you say to her? - Nothing. You sure? 'Cause you can say some pretty dumb stuff. Okay, let's just split up and find her, huh? Okay. Robbie, remember the girl I was here with? The Chiquita who paid for your stuff? I just dropped her off. - She was crying all over my whip. - What? She saw you macking the art babe, bro-seph. You kissed Jeffers-Johnson? What? No! No. Yeah. I mean, she saw that? In 3-D. Where is she? Sam, it's Heath. I've tried your cell several times. Please tell me you didn't leave. Just… call me. Sam, it's me, Heath. If you just… that kiss with Celeste is not what you think. We need to talk. I'm swearing off all contact with the outside world. Maybe there's an explanation. You were right about me. I'm unrealistic, and I'm hopeless. Hey. Since when do you listen to me? You are not hopeless. You're hopeful. And there is someone out there for you. I know it. Doesn't matter, I'm done. You're gonna be okay? I can't believe you're giving up. Have I taught you anything? Donny, I called her a hundred times. She doesn't want to talk to me. But you like each other, I know you do. Look, I'll be back in a week. I'll call her then. But it could be too late by then. The moment could be lost. Look, we'll be fine. Don't worry about us. - Thank you, May. - Bye-bye, sweetie. Don't know what I'd do without you. All right, give me a hug. I love you, buddy. Okay. It's gonna be okay. Ready to cross the pond? You're making the right choice, you know. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. And nobody would throw that away for a 72-hour "relationship", quote-unquote. Can you not talk like that? You're mad at me. Don't worry, we have a long flight. Plenty of time for you to forgive me. And in first class, might I add? Besides, you can fix things with her when you get back. If you even remember her name by then. Sam, it's Lynn. I'm having twins. Shower on the 20th. Save the date. Bye! Sam, this is Joel's mother. He asked me to call. You two kids owe it to yourselves to give this another try. All right? Bye, dear. Hi, Sam, it's Donny. I know what you think you saw, and I totally understand why you're upset, but just please give my dad another chance. Just think about it. Here you go, guys. Have a nice day. Thanks. Joel. My mother said you haven't been in. She thought you'd quit. Nope. Still here. Coffee? Actually, I'm not much of a hot-beverage guy. Okay then. Sam. What I really came in to ask you is… do want to go out again? Joel… I'm gonna have to say… no. I will not go out with you again. But thank you. Good, you're alone. I met someone. I can't believe I'm saying this. But I actually think he's perfect for you. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Look, you know I'm a skeptic, but this guy is different. How is he different? You're acting crazy. - He's right outside. - Outside? What, did he sleep in the gutter? No, he was awake. And very good-looking. He may or may not have a car. I didn't see one. He has a job. Sort of. - Not a job-job, per se. - Roz. Look, before you say no… he's right outside. I already promised him you were gonna go out there and meet him, so you really don't have a choice at this point. Are you kidding me? I'm not going out there. Oh, yes, you are. Roz, no! Roz… This isn't at all how I pictured it. Well, it's the best I could do. I know what you saw at the gallery. There's never been anything between Celeste and me. But what about London and your show? Come with me. Okay. You will? I will. Oh, my gosh, that is so romantic. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
