HOW THE FUCK YOU GONNA HAVE A 98% GOOD NIGGA AND YOU GOT RID OF THAT NIGGA FOR 2%, 'CAUSE HE CHEATED ON YOU A LITTLE. FUCKING 2%. YOU -- OH, WHAT? IT'S DIFFERENT NOW? LADIES LIKE, "NIGGA, THAT'S A BIG TWO, NIGGA. WHAT THE FUCK?" THE FELLAS THAT ARE WITH ME, "PLEASE MAKE THIS WORK, NIGGA. PLEASE, PLEASE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GONNA DO, NIGGA, PLEASE." JUST GOT TO UNDERSTAND, LADIES, SHIT IS COMPLICATED. PART OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP IS MAKING SURE YOUR MAN DON'T CHEAT. HELP THE NIGGA OUT. YOU KNOW NIGGAS LOSE FOCUS. WE EASY TO LOSE FOCUS. WE JUST WANT TO WORK AND PLAY AND FUCK AND EAT, AND NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER, 'CAUSE IF A NIGGA CAN FUCK, WE AIN'T EVEN HUNGRY. WE'RE JUST, "MM-MM, I ATE YESTERDAY. I'M GOOD. JUST GIVE A NIGGA A TIC TAC OR SOMETHING." JUST... LADIES, IT'S TIME TO DO SOME NEW SHIT. IF YOU ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP AND YOU WANT TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP, YOU'VE GOT TO DO CERTAIN THINGS TO KEEP RAGGEDY BITCHES OFF YOUR MAN. YOU ARE AT WAR WITH RAGGEDY BITCHES, 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T SUCK YOUR MAN'S DICK, I KNOW A RAGGEDY BITCH WHO WILL. NOW, I'M TELLING YOU, IF YOU WANT YOUR RELATIONSHIP, LADIES, HOWEVER MUCH DICK YOU ARE SUCKING, SUCK TWICE THAT AMOUNT AND SEE IF IT DOES NOT CHANGE YOUR RELATIONSHIP. LOOK AT THE FELLAS. "YES, NIGGA, YES. WHAT A RESOLUTION. YES, I AM BEHIND THAT." LADIES, LADIES, NOW, I -- LOOK. I SEE HOW Y'ALL ARE LOOKING AT ME. LOOK. LOOK, LET ME SAY THIS BEFORE I EVEN START. LADIES, IF YOU HAVE MADE A CONSCIENTIOUS DECISION THAT YOU ARE NOT GONNA SUCK ANY DICK, THAT IS YOUR RIGHT AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. LET ME SAY IT AGAIN. IF YOU HAVE MADE A CONSCIENTIOUS DECISION THAT YOU ARE NOT GONNA SUCK ANY DICK, THAT IS YOUR RIGHT AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. NOW, I WILL SAY IT DON'T LOOK GOOD ON YOUR RESUME WHEN YOU NEED SOME SHIT DONE AROUND THE HOUSE. I WILL SAY THAT. LADIES, YOUR JOB IS TO KEEP YOUR MAN -- KEEP HIM FOCUSED ON YOU, AND I THINK, LADIES, IF YOU WOULD JUST SUCK A LITTLE MORE DICK, I THINK -- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW POWERFUL IT IS. JUST -- WE GONNA -- I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME HOMEWORK. YOU TRY IT. I WON'T EVEN BE THERE, AND SEE HOW IT WORK. NEXT TIME YOUR MAN COME IN ARGUING AND CUSSING AND SHIT, JUST SUCK THAT NIGGA'S DICK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ARGUMENT, AND SEE HOW QUICKLY THE ARGUMENT ENDS. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT HE MAD ABOUT. JUST, "THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT, AND I'M TIRED OF THIS GOD-- MMM. SHIT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I BE HOLLERING AT YOU FOR. YOU AIN'T NEVER DONE NOTHING. YOU KNOW THEM NIGGAS AT THE JOB BE STRESSING A NIGGA OUT WITH SHIT AND... HERE I COME IN HERE BLAMING IT ON YOU AND SHIT." WE LOVE GETTING OUR DICK SUCKED IN THE CAR. IF YOU GONNA SUCK OUR DICK -- WE GET EXCITED AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH THE SEATBELT. WE JUST... START MOVING SHIT OUT THE MIDDLE AND TOOK THE RADIO OUT. IF YOU'LL SUCK OUR DICK IN THE CAR, WE'LL DRIVE 500 MILES IN THE MOST AWKWARD POSITION EVER. JUST... JUST SAYING, LADIES. IF YOU KNEW HOW POWERFUL IT WAS, YOU'D HAVE TO DO IT. LOOK, LADIES, LET'S JUST TRY SOMETHING OUT. JUST, TONIGHT, AFTER THE SHOW, JUST SUCK YOUR NIGGA'S DICK IN THE CAR ON THE WAY TO THE HOUSE, AND SEE -- LOOK AT THE FELLAS. "YES." [BABBLES] JUST TRY IT, LADIES, AND SEE IF YOUR RELATIONSHIP DON'T CHANGE IN THE MORNING, JUST SEE. WHEN YOU WAKE UP, THAT NIGGA WILL BE FULLY DRESSED WITH A HAMMER, JUST, "HOW ARE YOU DOING, BABY? ARE YOU OKAY? I BUILT YOU A PORCH RIGHT BY THE BED BECAUSE... THERE'S A DRIVEWAY RIGHT THERE IN THE BATHROOM. JUST TAKE A BATH AND..." [ZOOMS] I TELL YOU, LADIES, I KNOW SOME OF Y'ALL LADIES DON'T LIKE DOING IT. YOU THINK HEAD LACKS THE INTIMACY AND YOU MISS THE BOND AND SHIT. SOME LADIES DON'T LIKE IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY. THEY DON'T LIKE HAVING TO DO THIS TO A NIGGA. GET ON THEY KNEES IN FRONT OF A NIGGA THEY JUST CALLED A DIRTY SON OF A BITCH 45 MINUTES AGO. LADIES, IF THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, TELL THAT TO YOUR MAN. SEE IF THAT NIGGA DON'T TRY TO HELP THE RELATIONSHIP AND PULL A STEPLADDER RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LIVING ROOM. JUST... "OH, THAT'S MUCH BETTER. LOOK AT THAT. GOT YOUR POSTURE ALL UP AND SHIT. I APPRECIATE THAT." JUST SAYING, LADIES. SOME OF Y'ALL JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DO FOR US. LIKE, SOME OF Y'ALL LADIES THINK IT'S A PUSSY REPLACEMENT. HEAD AIN'T NO PUSSY REPLACEMENT. I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL REAL NIGGAS WHEN I SAY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PUSSY REPLACEMENT. PUSSY IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST, BUT HEAD IS IMPORTANT, TOO. SEE, PUSSY IS LIKE AN OVEN IN THE KITCHEN. IT'S THE BEST SHIT EVER. YOU CAN PUT A HAM IN IT, AND SOME BISCUITS, AND SOME VEGETABLES, AND IN AN HOUR AND 35 MINUTES, YOU COULD HAVE A HOME-COOKED MEAL. EVERYBODY WANT A HOME-COOKED MEAL. BUT HEAD IS LIKE A MICROWAVE. SOMETIMES A NIGGA AIN'T GOT AN HOUR AND 35 MINUTES TO BE FUCKING WITH YOUR ASS. SOMETIMES A NIGGA NEED A HOT POCKET RIGHT NOW, BITCH. JUST BING! THANK YOU. 30 SECONDS. BING! THANK YOU. JUST SAYING, LADIES, IF YOU DON'T SUCK YOUR MAN'S DICK, THERE IS A RAGGEDY BITCH WHO WILL, AND WE'VE GOT THE BITCH'S NUMBER. HANDLE YOUR MOTHERFUCKING BUSINESS. JUST SAYING. WE GOT TO -- LIFE IS CRAZY. WORK ON YOURSELF. STOP WORRYING SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU, AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK YOU THINK ABOUT YOU. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT SHIT. LADIES, LADIES, YOU CAN LEARN THAT FROM NIGGAS. AS NIGGAS, WE GET OVER OURSELF QUICK. LIKE, IF A NIGGA GOT A FLAW, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S PHYSICAL, WE GET OVER IT QUICK, LIKE, AT 13. WE GET PAST THE SHIT. LIKE, "NIGGA, I THINK I GOT A BIG NOSE. YEP, IT'S A BIG NOSE." THAT'S IT. LADIES, Y'ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT IT, TRYING TO CHANGE WHO THE FUCK YOU ARE. DON'T BE DOING THAT SHIT. YOU'VE GOT TO BE HAPPY ABOUT WHOEVER THE FUCK YOU ARE. IF YOU A BIG WOMAN, JUST BE A BIG, FLY-ASS, FINE-ASS, RICH WOMAN, AND LET THAT BE IT. STOP TRYING TO BE A SKINNY BITCH ALL YOUR LIFE. IT MAY NOT BE FOR YOU. YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME? LOOK AT STAR JONES' MOTHERFUCKING ASS. SHE DID THE SURGERY TO LOSE ALL THE WEIGHT. THEY DIDN'T TELL HER THEY COULDN'T TAKE THE FAT OUT OF HER MOTHERFUCKING HEAD, SO NOW SHE WALKING AROUND WITH A ROTTWEILER HEAD ON A DOBERMAN PINSCHER BODY, TRYING TO BE CUTE. THAT BITCH FELL OFF THE VIEW. JUST... SHOULD HAVE BEEN FUCKING HAPPY. LIFE TOO SHORT FOR YOU TO BE THAT HARD ON YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SELF. IF YOU FUCKING WITH ME, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF YOU'VE GOT STRETCH MARKS. I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHILE I'M FUCKING YOU HOW MUCH I LIKE IT. "JUST DON'T YOU EVEN WORRY ABOUT THAT, BABY. YOU LOOK LIKE A TIGER. I LOVE TIGERS. I REALLY DO. THAT'S WHY I BE GROWLING AT YOU SOMETIMES." JUST [GROWLS]. ♪ SHOW 'EM YOU'RE A TIGER ♪ ♪ SHOW 'EM WHAT YOU CAN DO ♪ THEY'RE GREAT! JUST SAYING, LADIES. GOT TO WORK. NIGGAS, WE GOT SO MUCH WORK TO FUCKING DO. [ WOMEN SHOUTING ] IT AIN'T EVEN FUNNY -- SHUT UP, LADIES! MOTHERFUCKERS COULDN'T WAIT. "YEP, IT'S THEY TURN." FELLAS, LOOK. WE GOT TO START TAKING SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOME SHIT. MOST OF US IN HERE GOT A CRAZY-ASS BABY MAMA, ME INCLUDED, AND WE LOVE TELLING PEOPLE HOW RETARDED THIS MOTHERFUCKER IS, WE CAN'T WAIT TO TELL THE STORY. "THIS IGNORANT, STUPID BITCH." WE CAN'T WAIT TO TELL SOMEBODY THAT STORY. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WE WAS THE ONE THAT WAS FUCKING THAT CRAZY BITCH. THAT WAS US FUCKING THAT CRAZY BITCH. WE'VE GOT TO STOP FUCKING CRAZY BITCHES. WE KNEW SHE WAS CRAZY WHEN WE WERE FUCKING HER. THE BITCH WAS HOLLERING OUT SHIT WHEN WE WAS FUCKING HER. JUST, "BANANA CREAM PIE!" WHAT? YOU DIDN'T EVEN STOP FUCKING HER. YOU'RE JUST, "WHAT DID THAT BITCH SAY?" NOW, YOU DONE FUCKED AROUND AND HAD A BABY BY BANANA CREAM PIE, AND NOW YOU MAD, SHIT. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP DOING IT, FELLAS. I AIN'T SAYING STOP HOW MUCH YOU'RE FUCKING. I'M JUST SAYING YOU'VE GOT TO START FUCKING A BETTER QUALITY OF WOMAN, BUT WE CAN BE DISTRACTED BY THE FAT ASS. THE WOMAN WITH THE FAT ASS DISTRACT A NIGGA. WE CAN'T. WE BE IN THE CLUB LIKE A PACK OF HYENAS SEEING A FAT ASS. WE JUST... MEANWHILE, WE DONE PASSED ALL THE GOOD WOMEN TO GET TO THIS WORTHLESS, FAT-ASS BITCH. SHE AIN'T NEVER DONE NOTHING WITH HER MOTHERFUCKING LIFE. NOTHING. SHE AIN'T GOT NO CONVERSATION, NO EDUCATION, SHE AIN'T TAKING CARE OF HER KIDS. SHE GOT CORNROWS IN HER HAIR. THE BABY GOT CORN IN HIS HAIR. THIS WORTHLESS BITCH. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'VE GOT TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM CRAZY BITCHES. DO SOME HOMEWORK. NEXT TIME YOU GO IN THE CLUB AND YOU GET READY TO TAKE A WOMAN HOME -- YOU DONE BOUGHT HER SIX OR SEVEN DRINKS AND SHIT, LOOK LIKE SHE READY TO LEAVE -- RIGHT BEFORE YOU TAKE HER OUT THE CLUB, GO IN THE BATHROOM, SHUT THE STALL, AND JACK OFF. AS SOON AS YOU JACK OFF, COME BACK OUT AND SEE IF YOU STILL TALKING TO THAT BITCH THE SAME WAY YOU WAS JUST TALKING TO HER. IT MIGHT SCARE YOUR MOTHERFUCKING ASS. YOU JUST, "BITCH, YOU OWE ME $7. WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING ABOUT? NIGGA, THAT'S BANANA CREAM PIE. WHAT THE FUCK?" I GOT TO -- I GOT TO DO THIS. I GOT TO DO THIS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS FOR A CERTAIN GROUP OF NIGGAS THAT'S IN HERE TONIGHT. REAL NIGGAS, GENERALLY DON'T EVEN TALK TO 'EM. I NEED TO SPEAK TO ALL THE BITCH NIGGAS IN ATTENDANCE TONIGHT. IF YOU WOULD PLEASE LISTEN. UH, BITCH NIGGAS, IF I COULD HAVE YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU. WE KNOW Y'ALL ARE IN HERE. EVERY TIME THERE'S A BUNCH OF REAL NIGGAS, THERE'S A BUNCH OF BITCH NIGGAS THAT COME TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE FUCK GOING ON. SO LET ME TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND, BITCH NIGGAS. I KNOW THE REAL NIGGAS ARE PROBABLY JUST WONDERING LIKE, "WHY WOULD YOU EVEN TALK TO THEM?" BUT BEFORE WE GO TO WAR WITH Y'ALL FOR ANOTHER YEAR, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A BITCH NIGGA ALL YOUR LIFE, OKAY? YOU DON'T. AFTER THIS SHOW, YOU CAN GET ONE OF THESE REAL NIGGAS IN ATTENDANCE TODAY AND LET HIM TUTOR YOU ON MONDAYS, WEDNESDAYS, AND FRIDAYS UNTIL YOU GET SOME OF THAT BITCH OUT YOUR SYSTEM. I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE, BITCH NIGGA, PLEASE. I'M GONNA TRY TO HELP BITCH NIGGAS.

IF YOU ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A WOMAN, AND YOU DON'T WANT NOBODY FUCKING HER BUT YOU, BITCH NIGGA, I WOULD SUGGEST YOU START FUCKING THE DOG SHIT OUT OF YOUR OWN WOMAN. I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL REAL NIGGAS WHEN I SAY THIS IS THE FINAL YEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA ALLOW YOU TO SEND YOUR WOMEN OUT TO THE CLUB, THEY ALL DEPRESSED, AIN'T GOT NO MONEY IN THEIR POCKET, CAN'T GET A DRINK, AND THEN THEY FUCK AROUND AND MEET A REAL NIGGA, WE FUCK THE DOG SHIT OUT OF HER AND SEND HER BACK TO YOUR HOUSE HAPPY AND SHIT, AND YOU UNGRATEFUL MOTHERFUCKERS WON'T EVEN SEND A NIGGA A CHRISTMAS CARD OR NOTHING. WON'T BUY NIGGAS A SHOT OF HENNESSY OR NOTHING. YOU DISRESPECTFUL BASTARDS. GO FUCK THE DOG SHIT OUT YOUR OWN WOMAN. WE ARE TIRED OF HAVING TO GO ALL THE WAY ACROSS CHICAGO TO FIX YOUR RAGGEDY-ASS FAMILY FOR NO THANKS. SO LISTEN TO ME, BITCH NIGGAS. TAKE NOTES IF YOU NEED TO. I'M GONNA TRY TO HELP YOUR RELATIONSHIP IF I CAN. FIRST THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND, BITCH NIGGA, THIS IS NOT 1996, SO YOU NEED TO STOP WITH THAT WHOLE, "I'M GONNA GET MINE, I HOPE YOU GET YOURS," SHIT, NIGGA. YOU NEED TO WATCH A PORNO. THESE NIGGAS IS PUTTING BITCHES IN PRETZEL SHAPES, AND THEY LIKE IT, NIGGA, IT'S A NEW GODDAMN DAY. YOU NEED TO GO TO THE NASTY STORE AND SEE WHAT THESE WOMEN CAN GET FOR $19.95. THEY DON'T EVEN NEED A BITCH NIGGA NO MOTHERFUCKING MORE. THEY GOT SHIT THAT'LL FUCK 'EM AND PUT AN EARPIECE IN THEIR EAR AND SAY GOOD SHIT TO 'EM. JUST, "YOU THE ONLY ONE IN MY LIFE. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY WHOLE CHECK. DID YOU LOSE WEIGHT? GOD DAMN YOU LOOK GOOD IN THEM JEANS." TIME TO STOP PLAYING WITH THESE WOMEN IN 2007, BITCH NIGGAS. FIRST THING YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND, BITCH NIGGAS, IF YOU'RE ON THE WAY TO YOUR WOMAN'S HOUSE, THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE YOU EVEN SEE HER IS JACK OFF. NOW, I KNOW THE BITCH NIGGA THINKING, "WHY WOULD I JACK OFF BEFORE I GET SOME PUSSY?" IT'S THAT TYPE OF THINKING THAT MAKES YOU A BITCH NIGGA. YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LISTEN TO ME WHILE I'M TRYING TO HELP, YOU RAGGEDY MOTHERFUCKER. YOU GOT TO GET THAT FIRST NUT OUT THE WAY. I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL REAL NIGGAS WHEN I SAY THAT FIRST NUT HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN. YOU CANNOT TRUST THAT MOTHERFUCKER. THE FIRST NUT WILL BETRAY YOU ANY CHANCE IT GET.

IF A NIGGA EATS YOUR PUSSY TWICE IN FIVE MINUTES, THERE WAS AN ERROR, BITCH. START FROM THE BEGINNING. START FROM THE BEGINNING. RESET. SO YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT FIRST NUT OUT THE WAY, BITCH NIGGA. GET IT OUT THE WAY. I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL REAL NIGGAS WHEN I SAY THERE IS NOTHING MORE POWERFUL THAN ARRIVING AT YOUR WOMAN'S HOUSE ALREADY ON NUT NUMBER TWO. YOU WON'T BE BULLSHITTING ON NUT NUMBER TWO. YOU JUST COME IN, "JUST GO ON AND LAY DOWN. GO ON AND LAY DOWN. YOU MIGHT WANT TO WRAP YOUR HAIR UP THIS EVENING. MIGHT WANT TO WRAP IT UP." NOW, LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY IF YOU WOULD, BITCH NIGGAS. ONCE YOU PUT ON YOUR CONDOM AND YOU ARE SAFELY INSIDE, THE ONLY WORD THAT NEEDS TO BE IN YOUR BRAIN IS "CONCENTRATION." YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE LOOKING IN HER EYES AND CARESSING HER SOFTLY AND SMELLING THAT RASPBERRY SHIT SHE GOT FROM BED, BATH, AND BEYOND. YOU NEED TO BE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING IN HER HOUSE BUT HER. JUST KEEP YOUR FOCUS. JUST... SING LITTLE SONGS TO YOURSELF OFF-KEY, SO YOU KEEP YOUR FOCUS.
