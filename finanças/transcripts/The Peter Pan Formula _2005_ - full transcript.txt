Shit! You're having fun here, do you really have to ruin our lives? Have a good life, assholes! I want to sleep with you. I want to sleep with you. I want to sleep with you. Your mom seems like a wonderful person. Drug of oblivion. Why did you keep it? Throw it away. Want me to do it? Hansoo, you do it yourself. Hansoo. Hansoo. My husband's on vacation. He's going to pick up his daughter. Want to have a date during the day? I'll be back later. See you. Where is my Minji? Perhaps over there, on the island. Thanks Minji! Dad! How is it here? Not that bad. I'm free here. Nobody to bother me. Still, it's better to be with your parents. I'll do that next year when I go back to school. How's the new home, Dad? How's stepmom doing? Just call her Mom... You can see for yourself. Did you think of what you want to eat or do? First, let's have a barbecue party. Then go fishing. On the island we visited last time. You were seasick in the boat. That's right. Then no fishing... - Minji. - Huh? Don't think too much all the time. I don't. I won! Lucky kite! I should be going. My husband will be back soon. We'd better not meet for a while. You go first. Here. Bye. Minji, come on out. You must be starving Yes, barbeque! When does your vacation end? Honey, didn't I tell you? I was fired from work. What? Then are we having the last supper? Mom, please wake up now. I just felt so... empty. There was no other reason. Though I also felt ashamed. My mom sent me to give you these. Who are you? Minji, the daughter. I stay at a sanatorium but I'm here for a visit. Are you sick? My head. I was raped. I made a friend in a chat room. His name is Yongki. He really liked me. Didn't you like him, too? I liked him at first. but I got tired of him quickly. He was boring. I tried breaking up, but he won't let go of me. I don't smoke. I lied that he raped me. I thought he'd leave, but he went to juvenile reformatory without a word. I acted crazy and was sent to a sanatorium. Two hours by boat from here there's a lighthouse island. I asked to be sent there. Do you want to smoke? I'm a competitive swimmer. Are you a model student or something? Give me a cigarette. God! Look here. Inhale like this. Open up your throat. Don't keep it in your mouth and then swallow. I feel dizzy. Hansoo! Hansoo, let's go check your time. What's wrong with wanting to visit your mom? Here, the teachers and students raised some funds. The principal is very interested in your swimming too. It must be tough. I have a mother who has Alzheimer's and two daughters. They all depend on me. My family was poor. to make me a national swimmer. My contract terminates this year. It will be difficult to extend it, without a good performance. I train harder, but I'm always slower than you. Do something other than swimming. I will, once I get into college Let's go together. It hurts to keep swimming knowing there's no future, doesn't it? I'd rather become a fisherman. Hansoo, you're in better shape than I thought. But I think you should start training from tomorrow. Reporter ha myung goo. 3:30am, a man wearing a stocking on his head enters a store.
