THE ADVENTURERS Excuse me. How much is this? - What? - That part... That is not for sale. It's for sale in all other places. But that's other places, I am very busy and please excuse me. Why is it not for sale? Are you from the scrap iron recycling program? I am not and I don't have time badgering with you. Couldn't you sell it to me? Roland are you there? Please go ahead. Have you arrived at the scene? I will be there in 10 minutes. Ten minutes, roger. - Is it a radio? - You are right, lady. I will wait for your return. It's up to you. Can't I go with you, I am free right now. I said it's not for sale. Since you are free, why don't you give me a hand. Hold tight. Hello. Hello. - Please go ahead. - It's ready here. Roger, I will be right there. May I ask what this is for? You mean this. Let me guess. You won't get it right. Here he comes. It can't be. Hey, Roland. - What are you doing? - Did you hire a secretary. What did you say? That girl. What's your name, Fran?oise, Yvonne? Belluto? Issabelle? Laetitia. It's Russian. What a romantic name. May I invite you for dinner? Don't play no more. - Listen. - What? Be serious, like it's the real thing. He did it! 25 million francs can be expected soon! The engine is a total success. 10-thousand-convolution super power house. 400 kilometers an hour. It means nothing to you, huh? - No. - No? - My name is Manu. - That was great. Really. If you wanna have a ride, help yourself. But she is your secretary. No, not my secretary either, and is already an adult. If so then come on in. Put on the blinder. Buckle the seat belts. Be careful. Luxuriant imitations again. It's really exciting. We are fatigued. - Do you feel good? - Very good. - Is this your first time. - Yes. This feeling is addictive. Really. You are so happy. - What do you wanna say? - Don't be shy. He is envying me. - Hallo! - You are sure to succeed. - When are you flying? - Tomorrow. - Where's the vidicon? - We have brought it. Give the film to the company and they will pay us. Find the one whose name is Kyobashi. This is the number, tomorrow I am not gonna be in. Keep it up. Bye. - How about a cup of drink? - I have to get the scrap iron from my old friend. - Roland? - Yes. Let me give you a ride. A beautiful girl. She truly is. Don't you have work to take care of. Flying practice with two interns tomorrow. Yes manager. Please give me a cup of coffee. How are you lately? - Did you have your meal. - I had an appointment with Roland. Is it gonna be late before you get back? I am not sure. I will be back early. I am driving really slow. I don't believe it. You will know when you get on, hold tight. - What is that? - This? Racing car. Racing car? 6500 convolutions. In an hour? - In a minute. - Then? 6500 convolutions a minute. So what? Flying speed is determined by convolutions. Increasing nitro methane to 98% and we can reach 8000 convolutions. Is it great. The thing is about the transmissions. If our system can be done it will be highly reviewed. But it's a secret for now. Wish you success. Thank you. What about the vidicon? There lens and can be zoomed. What a nice little factory. Lease me a fraction of place, will you. For what? Give it her. Let me tell you. That one. That red door. Mudguard. Front. Move it. It's dangerous. - Can this be sold. - Not really. I'll give your a cheap price on the rent. Come here 9 o'clock every day. - Is it too early? - No. Is it okay. Put the aperture of the vidicon to F8. Put it to F2 if it's cloudy. - I got it. - See you around. Be careful when you are piloting. - Is it Roland? - You got up? How can I leave you empty stomached. You are so considerate. Nothing abnormal, you can pass. Roger, I will be right there. He's got company. We will show you his skills soon. - Not good! - What... It's the flag. - Flag! - He's coming. Flag! Down below. What are you talking about! Manu are you hearing me. Answer me. He's coming. Where? Really! Hello. Everything is moved here. My father was an accountant. His wife is an ordinary housewife. For me I can only choose to be a pilot. I am going home, see you tomorrow. See you. So that... They said low altitude flying over streets is prohibited. And then? My license was revoked. Till when? Guess. Forever. I will not be able to fly for life. I am gonna be weak-spirited. - Yes? - May I speak to Mr. Kyobashi? - Who is speaking? - Manu Borelli. Please hold on a second. Mr. Borelli. - I don't know him. - But he knows you. This is Kyobashi. I am the one consigned the ask by you to fly through the Triumphal Arch. - With a camera... - Did it work well? I couldn't do it 'cuz the flag was raised, and my license was revoked. Please pay me the compensation. What are you talking about! Sorry but I am afraid that I will let you down. Look, they are flying! It's beautiful... We are gonna fly to ?tretat, right? And we can see the escarpment there. Put out the smoke. You look good. Don't get closer, I am very good at karate. Oh, really. That's too much. Roland leave that guy to me. I apologize, it's just a joke. Oh, just a joke. That we are very happy. Wait I have something good to tell you. Some way to make a lot of money. Really, it sound rather good. 500 million francs sank to the sea. So in the sea? In Congo. - Congo, huh? - Congo, right. On the plane, what fell into the sea. I swear it is true. I didn't lie. I am an insurance guy. That's enough. I haven't calmed my anger yet. - Enough. - I am not lying, it's in Congo If the same color appears 7 time in a row. Wait until the 5th time. Bet it using the opposite color 5 plus 7 equals 12. Unless you hit nothing, you won't be broke. What's the odds? It's there but very unlikely. Let's try. Black once. We need more capital. - What did you say? - Black twice. - Not even a little bit. - A little I have. - But I need to spend it on research. - Black 3 times. Laetitia the cars won't sell this way. Never mind. They're mobile sculptures. I know but... What are you trying to manifest? Only free people would understand. Roland! Black 7 times in a row! If it were me I wouldn't want a ride. - Reconsider it. - You can come back to the company. I will wait for you. Hopefully it's not the slowest car in the century. How many convolutions? Keep it up. Are you okay. We are so worried. Nothing but a little more work is needed. 21 red odd. Do we maintain black? Let's fight to the end. Black 320 francs. I will wait for you in the bar. Please chip in. No more chip in. - Would you dance with me? - Why not? Please chip in. Red 14 times. I don't want it. Enough. No more chip in. Good bye, gentlemen. Six black even. It's unbelievable. If you were a pilot would you fly through the Triumphal Arch? Flying through the Triumphal Arch? Don't be silly. If you were an engineer would you try to reform the car industry? I wouldn't do that. That's right. It's obvious that we were gonna win. Red 14 times in a row. Did you not guarantee that. If I obtain the patent for my research we are gonna make money. Don't even dream about it. I am not dreaming. Large enterprises are sure to fight for it. Paris 70 kilometers What do you think of those words? What words? The words about the crashed airplane said by that beaten guy. - In the sea of Congo. - Do you believe that? How much money was sunk to the sea according to him. - Probably 300 million. - Even more. - Really? - 500 million right. A huge money. It must be phony. - Damn. - What... We forgot Laetitia. Move those things. Don't break them. How are you? I am here to move things. Are you gonna go? Do you hate us. Why are you saying that. That night we forgot to pick you up and came back. - We were... - So why are so subdued. That night I had a great time. Today I bring an invitation of my personal exhibition. Why don't you come? I am gonna go. Be careful. This and that. Who paid the expense for the personal exhibition? - Of course myself. - Did you sell your jewelry? I have savings. I will pay you also. - Rent. - Let's talk about this later I don't know if I am gonna be here or not. Really. Hold on. Accept this it's now valuable. You are really great. Now we have properties. I'm looking for something original. The sculpture impresses me exceedingly. It's not bad. In the scope of religious art... I think it... It's like Picasso and so on. I can only add "Yes, that's a real act." It should create an image of a car accident. - Really? - Yes. - Do you have invitations? - Yes. - Show me. Over there. - Hurry. - Don't press us. From there it kind of reminds ship with sails. Amazingly the sea inspires me. It is the transcendental issue expressed through the material. This is best suited for vestibul a corporate building. Mr. Beld I apologize for my disrespect last time. Actually I need your help. - If it's in my power. - Certainly. The airplane in the Congo ... There is no information about that airplane. The last radio contact record happened here. The pilot and the passenger, the Belgian magnate Belluci disappeared with all their properties. People think they sank in the sea. What if they are found. Then our insurance company and the discoverers will share the money. It's regrettable that there are no evidence showing the magnate keeping the money on the plane. Roland. Hey, listen. The prisoner said to the executioner. I am ticklish, don't put the rope around my neck. Where's the car. What car? What, are you gonna travel. There are 500 million here. In 5000-meter deep sea? No, water area there is less that 100-meter deep. Every map says that. Yes. - Where is it? - There. Kibudgi. For sale 182. 183. 184. 185. 197. 198... So tired. Laetitia! What brings you here? How about your personal exhibition? You didn't come. We did. There were too many people and we couldn't find you. Angry? What's wrong? What happened? Tell us... Don't be emotional. All wasted. All efforts to date. Look at this. You will feel better when you talk to us. Take it easy. It's press commentary. Everything will be good again. Exciting but lacks personality. If you had to take everything like that... Rote aesthetics. It's just because they envy you. How about taking a break. Travel would be best. - Wanna go with us. - Where? Guess. The coolest place near equator is 16 degrees. Hold on. You are not gonna pay the fare for the ride? O.K. Your cigarette. Want a cigarette? France? Here you are? Got a fire? Are you collecting coral? Yeah. I want a job. Hire me. - We don't need one. - Just three meals. We have enough labors. Listen to me. Watch out! Blow it. Kiss. I'll be on board! No, like this. O.K. Go there. Sit. What do you want? Nothing. Are you sure this is the place? Don't move. Excuse me. We met again. - Manu! - No playing tricks. It's no use. What do you want? Listen to me. What? About treasure in Congo. Where are you going? - We want to get out of here! - Fast. - Thanks. I will pay you back. - Sure. See you in Brussels. We want to get out of here! You bastards! Half you've got. The rest of the next stop. He has a huge fortune. The plane crashed near the coast. That man dies. But I was saved. That's what I wanted to say. - Then? - That's all. Isn't that enough to interest you? Got any proof? No. I know where it is. Where? 8 kilometers northeast. Too vague. The plane left some marks on the cliff when it crashed. What marks? You will know that. Laetitia, if we succeed you will get at least 100 million. What are you going to do with that money? I will buy the house floating on the sea. Near La Rochelle. This has been my dream since young. Want some coffee? It's said that the house is a fortress surrounded by sea water. I will re-decorate it. Around will be stormy ocean... The sea is my first love. The sea in Winter is especially beautiful. I know... I once spent a Christmas in the Brittany Island. I'll have a studio there. Invent when floating in the sea. And I don't have to publish any works. Are you gonna live by yourself in such a big house? You are going to be lonely. The island of your home seems not bad. How about staying together with me? Don't you want it? You are more than welcome if it's both of you. Manu, look! Slow down. Haata fish. Haata fish also lives alone in its long long life You are becoming a lonely philosopher. You can't be like that. Stop. Over there. Air tank. What about those two? - Where's him? - Here. What's going on? Let's divide it into 3 shares. ?ty?i. - But Laetitia, she... - What are you talking about? Large ones... Small ones... - Large ones... - We can buy a new car. This is worth 150 million. They seem to have found it. Let me have a look. What about putting ours together? - Want a drink? - Okay. I shouldn't have asked. Do you care about? What? That girl Laetitia... She and you... just friends? - Is it unbelievable. - Yeah. You should be lovers. No. Why are you asking this, what do you think? How about you? Yeah. I am gonna buy a small airplane. For what? To tell you the truth, I am a pilot. My license was revoked though I used to fly for a club. - Which club? - Pr?cy Club. - You know what? - Yes. I went way back with the manager there. - Michaux? - Michaux. This is the sunset we can't find in cities. Regrettably it's all blocked by buildings. It's true. This is bad. Cities are not meant for living. Are you going to buy a sculpture studio? No. - I want to live with you. - With me? But... Manu? Steer for me. We are police, temporary check-up, stop the boat. We are checking passports and logbooks. We are police, temporary check-up, stop the boat. - What's happening? - There are always check-ups. - How many people on the boat? - Three. Give them the logbooks. - What are you doing? - Temporary check-up. Grovel down. - Are you crazy? - They are fake police. Laetitia! Manu! Get out. I have no other way. Why asking him to stay? Anybody here? Anybody here? - Good day. - Good day. - This is Le Tomple, right? - Yes. - Is this Mr. Thomas's? - Yes. My son went to other places. - What about your husband? - It's back there. Good day, sir. Good day. We've heard that. You know the Weise's, right? - Weise? - They left here during the war. Oh, Weise. Got any messages. One day when he was caught by the German armies. - He never came back. - He is Jew. He left his daughter Laetitia, right? Laetitia... she's a wonderful child. Does she have any relatives? Bring the postcards. The child should have grown up. Laetitia... - Shall we give them? - Let them have a look. There are relatives looking for her after the war. These are the addresses. - In La Rochelle. - It became so lonesome after the child is gone. - Is this her? - Yeah, when she was a child. - We want to give you some gifts. - No thanks. We are friends Weise. - Are you sure? - We don't need anything. Anything. What is that camel? Napoleon used to ride it in Egypt. The museum here borrowed it from elsewhere. Welcome. - Are you Mr. Debru? - Yes. - What can I do for you? - Is Laetitia... your niece? - Police? - No. We need to talk to you about something. But my husband is not at home now. He will be back in the evening. Let's come back again, Roland. What? I am thinking... About what? It's me who asked her to go. You mean the travel last time. I brought her to that place. It's us two who brought her there. Don't blame it on yourself only. I know. - How much? - 2 francs. - Alone? - For both. - Is it a problem to put our luggage here. - No problem. - Where? - Over there. - From here, right? - Let me introduce to you. This museum is founded by Baron Gorgaud. after returning from his travels in Africa. Gorilla is the largest among apes. When it's attacked by human it becomes fierce. These are serpent and panther. That is a flying squirrel. This bow and arrow is usually used by people living in deserts. Kalahari Desert... it is... Kalahari is a desert. You will die at once when you are shot by the arrow. There are made by the Zulu people. You know everything. I recite them all. How much is 7 times 8? - Why ask this? - Nothing. You are great. What are these? Mosquito and Tsetse fly, they are big. You will be in a coma if stung by them. Sleeping on and on... Like sleeping beauty. Napoleon's camel? One-hump camel. There seems no hair on it. People plucked it for commemoration. You haven't seem the room of lions and crocodiles. Not this time. Your tip... Thank you. A little fellow who knows everything should recognize this? - Did you steal it... - Native of Congo. Have you been there? - Yes, do you want it? - Yes. - Keep it then. - So great. Bye. They are coming. Please come in. Sorry for the wait, please get seated in the dining room. There? This is my husband. - Darbant. - Borelli. Are you the uncle of Laetitia? But I don't have to take any responsibilities for her. She never came back after she left. We don't know anything she did. She is a very frank girl. Although left home by herself. We will make up for anything she did. I think you didn't get it. She is dead. This is her relic. Dead? An accident on Africa sea. Unbelievable. You don't have to fake it. Excuse us for our response before... Thank you for sending her relic all the way. Excuse me. - It's you? - This is my home. - Your son? - Yes. Why? - Her cousin. - Whose? - Laetitia. - Yes. This is 100 million francs inheritance. It all belongs to your son. It'll be left at the notary first. When he grows up. He will get the money by himself. Where does... the money come from? Relax. It all belongs to Laetitia with certificates. Suddenly all that money... It wouldn't bring any trouble to you. You don't have to thank either. We came here just because we wanted to. Afterwards you only have to sign at the notary. - Roland. - What? I don't have to make money by collecting shells. You seem to be happy doing that. Beautiful, huh, I will give you if you like it. Did you find treasure in the sea? - Why do you ask this? - Nothing. How is Laetitia? Roland, I find treasure too. - You? - Yes. - Are you kidding. - It's true, come with me. Over there. Grownups had brought me there. I will bring you there. Come on. Hurry up. Not bad, huh. It's said that the house is a fortress surrounded by sea water. I'll have a studio there. Around will be stormy ocean... Invent when floating in the sea. Freeze! Put your hands up. That is not a toy. It's my treasure. - Have you fired them? - I can't. Don't do it with children around. He won't be scared. - Is it broken. - Yeah. There are many more. Where are you going. Here. Hurry up. Inside here. It's the secret of three of us. And ammunitions. If it drops we will be blown up. - I shouldn't be working since its so old. - Really? Throw it down. The shipping is setting off. I am returning to Paris. - When? - Now. - Now? - Yes. Be careful and take it easy. Do not drive like a maniac. You will be the next. You too. Manu Borelli? - A fellow teaching control in the past? - Yes. His is as skillful as before. With big heart also. - Your skill is not rusty at all. - Yeah. - It's reassuring to fly with you. - I am like returning to my childhood. Then that's great. - Great skills. - I will buy you a champagne. - Chief... - Flawless skills. No license though. - Try re-apply one. - No, that's my past. Does not miss me and I hate to beg. I will pay. You are so rich... I inherited a fortune. Cheers. Cheers for the Triumphal Arch. What about Yvette? One card. Anybody else, gentlemen? Bet of 1000 francs. The piston compresses the air. At the same time plug the power. When it explodes press the piston, then the piston will be moving. - Understood? - Not a bit. Is Manu's car fast? 200 kilometers an hour. I will buy the same build but with red color when I grow up. What do you want to be when you grow up? Librarian in a museum. In a museum. Yvette. Manu. How come you are here? Understand at the first sight, right? I have a car. You car is so beautiful. Is that the guy? Is that the guy over there? No. Are you sure? On the top floor. What do you say? It's not him. Okay, let's go. Manu... Roland. Roland! Roland! Roland! To the Fortress Island. Come on in. Please be quick. - Are you sure it's him? - The guy who bought the Fortress Island. Thank you, he takes me back. This is personal property. - Roland! - Manu! Come on up. Here you come. - Did you buy this place? - Does it surprise you? Come here and I have a plan to talk to you. Unbelievable, huh? Transform this place to a hotel and restaurant. Nice, huh? You will see the ocean from any guest room. You can fish right from the window. The best part is guests could gather together. I have epoch making ideas. I wanna use helicopters to transport guests. You will be in charge of this. I'll build a small airport. And use transparent glasses. A big pillar in the center. It also gives off huge fogs. That will make this look like a ship. And the restaurant... The restaurant will be above this Having meals while surrounded by sea water What do you think? Is this for her? - Who? - Laetitia. This idea... She said it to you, right. When? Certainly the last day. No. Never heard of it. You two on the top, put your hands up and get down. You can't run away. Hey, you! Put your hands up. Hurry! Get down. Manu! Roland. If you are not coming out we will get up there. I want one of them alive. Get out! I'll blow you up. You bastards! Manu. - Put yourself together! - Wait, Roland. You know what Laeticia said? She wants to live with you. You old liar!
