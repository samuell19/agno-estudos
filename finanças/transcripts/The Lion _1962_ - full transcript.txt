Thank you. Hello. Hello. Well, you're looking rather fit. You look fit yourself. Isn't Tina with you? Well, I thought that we should talk first. What did you tell her? Oh, just that you'd be here. And bullit? I told him that you'd planned a trip to Africa and would like to... Drop by. Did he believe that? I think so. So, neither one of them knows that you wrote me? You really are desperate, aren't you? Yes. Yes, I am. Well, why didn't you pack her off to Europe to school, or to america? I wrote you that. Because I'm not sure that it would be right. In other words, you want me to make the decision as to whether you're right. Or wrong. I could be wrong. That's quite an admission from you. Oh, please, Robert. Don't. Tina needs help. Please help. All right, I'll give it a try. I thought it would be easier on all of US if you stayed in the guest house. Where else? It's not bad, you know. Bogo, this is Mr. Hayward. Hello. Make bath for bwana now. Later, bogo. Take the bags in and take care of the car. For me? Well, it's not for your husband. I saw it in a hotel in Nairobi. I remember you used to like it. Thank you very much. Where is bullit? Won't be back until afternoon. Some trouble with poachers. And Tina? She's off somewhere. She'll come when she's ready. She's quite independent. But she'll show up... If only to see if she remembers what her father looks like. Well, if you have everything, I'll leave. When breakfast is ready, I'll send bogo. Wait a minute. Don't you worry about Tina straying off into the bush? You know I worry about Tina... But not for her safety. Not that way. What way, then? What's to become of her in this wild place, nothing but primitives and animals for companions? Two hundred miles away from nowhere. She must have a normal life and education. Chris, I agree with you 100 percent, but a school would-- it's not that simple! Be patient. You'll see. And Robert... You're not to leave the compound without a ranger. It's a game reserve, a sanctuary for the animals. You know. I promise not to bite the animals. ( Chuckles softly ) Thank you for the perfume. ( Screeching ) ( Wildlife sounds ) ( Wildlife sounds ) Tina: Stop there. Don't go any further. I shouldn't have sent for you. Did you? You sent for me? 'Course. Nicholas the monkey, and then simbaline. She's the gazelle. Shh. They're my pets. They belong to me. They're quite tame. They'll let anybody pet them. In fact, they're just like cats and dogs, really. Not like my wild creatures. You can't get close to them. But you do. ( Elephant trumpeting ) ( Bellowing ) Tina: They're my friends. They know me. They trust me. They don't know you, and anyway, visitors aren't allowed out of the compound without a ranger along. My father sees to that. Your father? I'm Tina bullit. You must know my father, John bullit. He's the warden here. Do you know who I am? You used to be my father. I still am. Not a real father. I'll try and be friendly with you, for my mother's sake. But I don't feel friendly. Do you hate me? No, I don't. Maybe when I was very little. Did your mother ever try to explain... Oh, she's always explaining. How she asked you to stay away so I wouldn't be confused. But you shouldn't have stayed away. What should I have done? I don't know. I don't know as much about people as I do about animals. Anyway... if you had really loved me, you would come to see me, sometime, somehow. Animals don't forget their cubs. Tina? Tina? Would you like something else? Oh, no. No, thanks. ( Speaking native language ) We tried a boarding school in Nairobi. At first she seemed to accept the idea. It didn't last. She ran away like some wild creature who escaped from a cage. She turned up here. Bullit was delighted. Openly. He thinks he has created her in his own image. In fact, he has. She even speaks like him. And you don't approve. How is it with bullit and you? Oh, fine. Why do you ask? I'm not sure. The question occurred when I first read your letter. Did you think I sent that letter just to get you here? Well, I'm here. The legal mind again. The brilliant junior partner of hayward & hayward challenging the motives of the witness. Well, it is your daughter who concerns me, Robert hayward, and it is your daughter who should concern you. Still the terror of the courtroom. Still the egotist. My, oh, my. Come on, Chris, let's have some more coffee. I guess I am an egotist. I thought you were glad to see me. I-I was glad to see you, Rob. Thank you. And I'm glad that, uh, everything is good between you and bullit. Why wouldn't it be? Oh... When a woman tames a great white hunter-- cages him-- the rogue male may go gently... at first. Forget it. I guess I am needling you. She looked well. Tina? Oh, she is. And she's bright. Terribly bright. Like you. I thought so. What little I saw of her, her life seems like every child's dream. Rich and full. Do you remember the last time we saw each other, in Nairobi? Do you remember what you said to me? Every word. I said... Africa has bewitched you. Well... Africa has bewitched Tina. It hasn't hurt you. Why should it hurt her? I was grown. I'd had my share of the other life. I... I chose to live here. It was a choice. When Tina is grown, if she goes on this way, she'll have no choice. She'll marry a man like bullit... And she'll be happy the way her mother is happy. First, you must come and see some of the Africa that I know. You owe her that, and I owe you that. Then, if you think she belongs... Well, come on. I'll show you some of Africa. ( Grunting sounds ) ( High-pitched squeals ) Right there, behind that tree! Look! ( Laughing ) What's the matter? We have to back up. Well, why don't they step aside and let US go by? This tribe steps aside for no man, and few beasts. This reserve once belonged to them, and they still have a right to go through it and set up their menyatas-- camps-- wherever they like. Jambo. That young one looks wild enough. The old one with the scars, who's he? That's old kalu, the chief. The young one is his son ouriounga. The crown prince? Ouriounga is a warrior. His tribe are great lion-killers. Is it good eating, lion? Oh, Robert, cattle is their meat. They have large herds. Some they own, some they steal. They have no scruples for other people's property. Last night in the barnyard, I heard a man talking about what a great lion-killer bullit was... In his time, that is. This tribe admires bullit for it. I can understand why. He also thinks that, uh, other people's property is his for the taking. Oh, Robert, I was not your property. Bullit did not steal me. You always call him bullit? Everybody does. Are you trying to needle me again? 'Course not. I just thought that by now you'd be on more intimate terms. There are times when I call him John. Three elephants and a rhino were found dead yesterday with their tusks and horns missing. I want you to order your boys to comb the whole reserve. I want every one of the poachers brought in. Is that understood? All right. Company dismissed. Well... ( Laughing ) ( Child crying ) I think I know who that is. ( Child crying ) ( Excited voices ) Hello, hayward. Hello, bullit. Where is Tina off to? Anything wrong? No. She's got her back up about something ever since your talk with her this morning at the water hole. ( Chuckles ) She didn't tell me. The old fellow, my tracker kihoro, he's also her shadow. I didn't see him this morning. That's the idea, sport. Even Tina doesn't know. She thinks she's always alone with her wild ones, so don't you spoil it by telling her. That's why I don't worry when she goes off alone. Isn't he a little old for the job? ( Chuckles ) He can kill anything with one shot. Did you get fixed up all right at the guest house? Comfortable? Oh, yes. Fine. Thank you. Christine says you're on business in Nairobi. How long are you staying with US? Don't rush me, bullit. I just got here. Stay as long as you like. Get to see the whole reserve, see all the game. I'd like that. Bullit, this must be kind of a dull life for you. No more safaris for the great white hunter. A man can't take his wife and child on safari. And he'd be a fool to leave a woman like this alone. Especially when there are poachers about. ( Chuckles ) Right, sport. Raaahhh! ( Kihoro laughing ) Tina: Oh, you're good fun, kihoro! But no tell daddy! Come on, let's go and see king. Rather posh for an ex-husband, isn't it? ( Speaking native language ) Why don't we eat out on the veranda? It'll be cooler. It will be cool soon. ( Animal howling outside ) It's almost dark. Where is that child? Probably outside the window, watching her mother make a perfect fool of herself. ( Speaking native language ) You mean this? You didn't complain when I put on a display for your commissioner. What's he doing here, anyway? Robert wants to be sure that Tina has more to her life than... Than eating in mud huts and... It's a bit late for him to care. He's got a nerve. Won't say how long he's staying. He's just arrived. Then he can damn well leave. Please don't be rude. For me. Please. That's better. It's time Tina learned a little about this kind of thing. You don't want her to grow up completely wild. Why not? She's your daughter. She'll have your kind of appetite. You didn't leave hayward for the finer things of life. While he was playing the big lawyer and flying all over the world, you didn't think it was wild to come on safari with me, did you? Bullit: Hmm? Come in, hayward. I'll fix you a drink. Thank you. Present for Tina. Thank you. ( Bellowing roar outside ) Sorry I'm late, but king insisted on seeing me home. ( Breathlessly ) Do sit down. I won't be long. Who is king? King is a full-grown lion. He happens to be Tina's constant companion, her best friend. Yes, you should see them romping together. It's quite a sight. I can imagine. Man on radio: Peter one calling Peter four. Excuse me. Peter one calling Peter four. How do you read me? Over. Peter four hears Peter one. Over. "And here, in this forbidden place, "where trees were spun of dark green lace, "the lion fell beneath the spear "and Rose again as it came clear to kill." That's beautiful. It isn't easy to read poetry. But it's about the tribe that's on the reserve now, so I understand it. They're very brave, like lions themselves. They hunt lions with nothing but a shield and a spear. Most of them get killed, like the one in this poem. All the old ones have been chewed up, scarred. Like that old man we saw today. Old kalu? You saw kalu? We passed him and his son. Ouriounga's a fine specimen, but I have to keep my eye on him. Can't have him going after my lions on the reserve. Another Brandy, hayward? Oh, no thanks. I-I've had enough. I have a present for you. Here it is. Oh. There you are. Say thank you and open it. No, no, no, no, no. Open it and then... ...Say thank you! ( Light chuckle ) Oh, it's beautiful. I haven't got a hand mirror, just a small mirror over my washbowl. This is lovely. Thank you very much. I must show it to daddy. Daddy? Bullit: I'm in the dining room, dear. She reads well, doesn't she? Oh, not only does she read well, but she understands what she's reading. That's the most important thing. You've done a fine job, Chris. Well, I've tried to surround her with books, music. Well, quite honestly, I can't see why you're so worried about her. I am, Robert. Handsome pheasant. Cost a pretty penny, too. Mummy always liked those fine old things. We must give him something in return. Yes! I'll give him a monkey for a pet. Why don't you take him to meet king? That'd flatter him. Yes. Shows that you think enough of him... ...to introduce him as a friend. Yes, yes. I will tomorrow. That's good. Good night, dear. ( Giggles ) ( Wildlife sounds ) Has bogo gone? Yes, yes. I didn't want him to see me. I wanted you to come and meet a friend of mine. A friend? You mean, uh, your lion friend, king? How did you know? Oh, I have magic powers. When do we go? You aren't scared? No. Should I be? Not if I'm with you, but mummy would be scared if we told her. She worries. That's why I didn't want bogo to hear. He tells her everything. I can keep a good secret. Well, we'll just take off now. We'll be back for lunch. Then you can tell mummy. King will like you, if I explain who you are-- my father, and so on. You won't believe me, but king understands everything I tell him. If I tell him to be your friend, he will, but I could make him kill you. I hope you won't. ( Laughter ) Memsaab! Memsaab! What is it, bogo? They have gone into the forest. Who? Missy and bwana hayward, alone. Where's kihoro? I-I don't know. They've gone to see king. Get the car. Hurry! Come on! Tina: Don't get lost! Bit slippery here. ( Giggles ) Come on! ( Hissing ) Must not touch snakes. Poison! Thanks. Thanks very much. ( Wildlife chittering ) ( Laughing ) Stay there. Don't come until I call. ( Deep growls ) ( Deep growls ) Stay there. King... ( Deep growl ) Don't be afraid. Just don't move yet. Just wait. ( Speaking native language ) I'm telling him you're a friend. Now come one step. Just one. Now one more. Only one. ( Low growl ) Down! Down, king! Down, king! Down! Now another one, if you're not afraid. Now just keep coming, one step at a time. Let him smell your hand, and then pet him between the eyes. ( Growl ) Down, down, down! Now pet him between the eyes. Good. He knows you. But now start talking until he gets used to your voice. Say something. I'm not sure I can. You got an awful scare, didn't you? ( Chuckles ) What makes you think that? ( Laughing softly ) Well, he knows you now. I've picked the best time to introduce you. King's had a good kill. His stomach's full. Do you think he'd mind if I had an after-dinner smoke with him? ( Laughing ) No, not at all. King obeys beautifully. He always does what I tell him. You watch, I'll show you. Come on, old fellow. ( King bellowing ) Wee! That's fun! Come on! No! ( Laughing ) Over again! Come on, fellow! ( Tina laughing, king roaring ) No, king, stop it! No, king! No, please, king. No, not too much. You see? That's... Quite something. And also beautiful. Do you really think king is beautiful? Magnificent. Well, he's mine. He belongs to me, and I belong to him. I've got absolute control over him. He does everything I tell him. He could tear you to pieces if I wanted him to. Mmm. Up, king, up. ( Low growl ) Tina: I'll show you something now. Just you watch. ( Tina speaking native language ) I only have to give the word. You want to see? You want to? Tina, stop it. Enough of this nonsense. Down, king. Get down. I'm sorry. I wouldn't have let him hurt you. I was only playing. You'd better go now, or king will be disturbed the rest of the day. But don't worry, I'll explain everything to him. There's an easy path that way. It leads you straight back to the compound. You mean that wild trek was unnecessary? I thought you'd like a real taste of the bush. If you're afraid to go alone, king and I will escort you. I'm not that afraid. You saw that? Yes. All the time, I kept thinking that... Well, no matter what happens, I was being damn brave. Very. Very damn brave. Mummy kissed him, king! She kissed him! ( Low growl ) Careful, Tina! King has taken a mate. She didn't know. King. King? Where are you going? King? Please, darling, come with US. I don't need any of you! King will look after me! King! Wait for me! King! King! King! King! Where are you? Tina, please come back. Go away! King! ( Growling ) ( Hissing ) ( Roaring ) King! I knew you loved me. You saw. King chose me. He's mine. ( Speaking native language ) Stay away from her. You naughty thing. King will see me home. He really loves me. Now you're beginning to see? If I hadn't seen it... Well, I wouldn't have believed it. It's like witchcraft. Now do you understand, king? I don't want you to have anything more to do with that nasty lioness again. Who does she think she is? She's tucked in, sound asleep. She was exhausted. Well... it's been an exhausting day. What about her, Rob? I'll, uh, talk to bullit. Talk? Talk. Both of you being polite men of the world. What do you want me to do, slug him? It isn't all his fault, you know. What a fool I was to fall for all of that about a child being better off with its mother. What a damn fool! I was a fool to ask it. You were once bewitched by all of this. The mirage has gone, hasn't it? That's why you sent for me. For Tina's sake. Need I keep reminding you that she's your child too? ( Scoffs ) That connection was severed before I had a chance to be her father. In a sense, it never existed. Neither one of US can remember it. With you and me, it's different... ...because it's you I remember, and you remember me. I let you go so easily. Just for the asking. You didn't care! I cared! Please, Robert, do me a favor. Could I sent your dinner to the guest house? I want to talk to bullit alone. Now that I'm ready to help you, you don't need me. Bullit has eyes and ears through the whole reserve. I'm sure that he will know all that went on today. You mean... He'll know that... You kissed me? Yes. That too. All the more reason for me to stay. Hello, hayward. Hear you've had quite a day. Hear you've met king. Did you also hear that king has taken a mate? That's right. ( Chuckles ) And Tina put her in her place. Hardly a laughing matter. Well, that depends on your sense of humor. You have to have a rugged one for this country. This no place for the oversensitive. Or for children. It's been a long day. I... thought that Robert might enjoy a quiet dinner, alone. Nonsense, darling. No one in his right mind is going to pass up dinner with someone like you. Right, hayward? Right, sport. And after dinner, I'll get out the snapshots of Tina and king. They'll make you proud of her. Proud as I am. Would you like more coffee? No, thanks. Here you are. Take a look at some of these. That's how it all started. I found that little fellow wandering around the bush on his own. Couldn't have been more than five weeks old. May have left his mother, or his mother may have been killed. I brought him back, really, to show Tina. As soon as she saw him, it was love at first sight. Look at this one. She called him king, and from the beginning, he lived like one. Here. He looks rather more than a cub here, doesn't he? He'd be about eight months. That was about the time that Christine got angry with him, running round the house. Well, he chewed up all my armchairs, tore my best tablecloths to shreds, battered the lovely screen. Well, you remember, Rob-- the one you brought me back from Japan. Quite an active animal. How did you, uh, get him to leave? Well, that had to be faced. It was a question of choosing between king staying and Christine leaving. How long ago was that? About a year ago. I took him in the back of the Land Rover and took him to the edge of the forest. It wasn't a simple matter, getting him to live in his new home. How did Tina take all of this? Oh, she's perfectly contented. Why shouldn't she be? Nothing really changed. Instead of king living here with her, now she practically lives in the forest with king. Now, now, darling, it's not as bad as that. Of course she visits him every day. That's perfectly natural. They were brought up together. They love each other. It would be inhuman to keep them apart. Don't you agree, David? Of course, of course. More Brandy? No, thanks. I-I think I'd better turn in, get some sleep. Thanks for showing me the pictures. Thought you'd enjoy them. And, um-- I did-- thanks for the lovely dinner. Don't sleep in too late. I'm taking you for a tour round the reserve. Ah. Looking forward to that. Good night. Good night. I think we convinced hayward that Tina is happy, don't you, darling? I agree. Haven't you got a kiss for me too? ( Chuckles ) Just thought I'd mention it. Wasn't necessary. I knew you knew. ( Chuckles ) You never think it's necessary to explain any of your actions, do you? I like it that way. You know you're somebody, and you never forget it. Neither do I. And neither does hayward. John, listen to me. Tina is in trouble. She's under a great strain. You don't know what it's like. You tell me. And tell me what it's like to be a little girl who sees her mother kissing a man she thinks is a stranger. And is. And had better remain so. ( Wildlife sounds ) ( Wildlife sounds ) ( Chittering ) ( Chittering ) Oh, shut up, Nicky. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. Oh, that's all right. I just saw the picture album, you and king. Hm? Oh! That was when we were both very young. I can see why he loves you so much. I love him just as much. Just as much. Well... Because you love him so much, you've got to be careful not to take advantage of him. I don't understand. Well, for instance, uh... There are many things that you do without king. I mean, you go about in a Jeep, you eat your dinner at a table, you live in a house. And these are the things that king can't do with you. Mm-hmm. And because he loves you so much, he allows you to do these things without him. He allows you to live your kind of life. You must allow him to live his. I see. You mean... I shouldn't try and stop king from... I shouldn't try and stop king from having a mate, that's what you mean. Yes. I suppose I'll have to get used to it, and so will king. But we'll never stop loving each other, never. Of course not, dear. Everything and everybody needs love. Always remember that. Listen, chum, I think we'd better get some sleep. I understand we're off on the grand tour tomorrow. Yes, daddy told me. 'Night, Mr. Hayward. I mean... Good night. Good night. Well, there it is. My Africa. Take a good look. It was here before the beginning of time. I wouldn't change it for anything. Rhino! Let's go and say hello! Bullit: I put a lot down three days ago. Big herds have been through. Tina: Game loves salt. Daddy sees that they get plenty of it. Well, I have a large family. I'll take you down to the plains now. This is a menyata, a camp. These people are migrants. They have very few possessions-- just their cattle and themselves. Soon they'll move on. Look, daddy, there's the old chief. I want to hear what he's saying. ( Speaking native language ) It's his old wound. It's opened up again. ( Speaking native language ) Tina: When he was a young warrior, he killed his lion. And now his lion is getting his revenge. He's calling him to join him in death. Soon he will die. Do you really believe that? About the lion calling him? Of course. ( Greetings in native language ) Sit tight. Just his way of showing he expects to be chief pretty soon. Jambo. Africa's version of the angry young man. Sometimes they can be very angry. ( Roaring ) Exciting? ( Elephants trumpeting ) ( Elephants trumpeting ) Keep your shirt on. The show is about to begin! ( Bellowing and trumpeting ) ( Bellowing ) Aren't you getting a little too close? ( Bellowing ) ( Bellowing ) ( Bellowing ) ( Bellowing ) ( Engine races ) ( Roaring ) ( Bellowing ) ( Bellowing ) ( Bellowing ) He's gaining on US, daddy. Release the trailer, if you can. I'll try. ( Elephant bellowing ) Bullit: Good show, sport! You can say that again. What happens if your engine stalls? I never worry about things like that. Worry can kill a man. Well, I've got work to do. I'll be back before dark, darling. All right. Bye, daddy. Ohh. I'm starved. Let's go in and have some lunch. Good. I know. After lunch, we'll show Mr. Hayward monkey haven. Shall we, mummy? Well, if he'd like to see it. Would you, Rob? I suppose so. But listen, young lady. No tricks, no snakes, and no wild treks through the bush. No, nothing like that, I promise. All right, in that case, I'd be glad to go. Good. I'll go and tell bogo to get the car ready for after lunch. What a wonderful zest for life she has. Yes, but it has to be the right kind, Rob. See that one? He's my favorite. I call him Moby! That's appropriate. Aren't you glad you came? Yes, it's a wonderful sight. Thanks for suggesting it. I'm so glad you're happy. ( Abrupt silence ) What is it, Tina? I don't know. Something's wrong. ( Silence continuing ) Listen. ( Low moan ) Do you hear him? Sounds like a moan. Is that the old chief? Yes, it's old kalu. His people must have brought him here to die. See the vultures waiting for him? They know too. Why did they bring him here to die? If he died in the menyata, then his spirit would stay. They'd have to burn the place and move on. Even the baboons leave their sick behind if they can't keep up with the troop. Do you accept such cruelty? It's always done this way. Well, it won't be this time. Bogo. Lend me a hand. Bogo no give hand. They kill bogo if he help. Oh, come on, now. Help me get him up. Tell him, memsaab. Tell him all the tribe are angry if a chief die in compound. It's true, Rob. Nevertheless, we're gonna take him back with US. Kihoro hate this tribe. They old enemy. Jolly good watch enemy die. Jolly good, huh? Grab his feet. We'll put him in the car. Well, we've done all we can, old man. The rest is up to you. ( Muttering in native language ) It's the lion! The lion's calling him again, mummy! He wants to go! Let him go! Oh, stop this nonsense, Tina. Go and tell Anna to get some warm soup ready. Who in the hell authorized you to do this?! I don't need authorization to try to save a life. You've certainly fouled things up here. I tried to warn him, daddy. Tina! Do as I say. It's my job to protect and respect the traditions of the tribes on this reserve. It wouldn't be the first time that do-gooders started a tribal war. You should have told him. Told him what? That we leave people to die in the bush, to be eaten by wild dogs before they're quite dead. That we bring up a child to accept all this as inevitable? Well, the damage is done, but I know what to do about you. I'll have a plane waiting for you at the airstrip in two hours. I expect you can be packed in that time. I can be, but I won't be. Then I'll make it very clear-- I'm ordering you off this reserve, and I have the authority to do so. Bullit, I don't think you will. There's something I was going to discuss with you later, but this seems to be a pretty good time. Read it. That's only a copy, of course. The original document was recorded and filed in Nairobi when Christina and I got a divorce. Take a good look at it, sport. What is it? What does it say? If I know anything about that legal- minded jackal, it means trouble. He can take Tina whenever he wants. He has a tight legal document to back him up. You think she should go, don't you? You've thought that a long time. That's why you sent for him. But tomorrow. He could take her tomorrow! But legal documents or not, he won't take her until she's willing. That depends on you. I knew he spelt trouble the moment you told me he was coming. I knew he'd break my life in two. It won't be forever. It'd be like her going off to school, and then he'd let her come and visit US. US? US? There'll be no visits. If I know you, you'll follow her. No. If you help with Tina, if you'll make it easy for her to go... I promise you, John, I won't leave you. No matter how easy I make it, a lot of happiness will go from this house. I'll have to think it out. Would you mind if I told Robert of our talk? I... think he ought to know. Of course not. Maralell calling kirinyaga game reserve. Do you read? Over. Doesn't matter, really. Hayward knows he holds all the aces. Maralell calling kirinyaga game reserve. Do you read? Over. Maralell calling kirinyaga game reserve. Do you read? Over. Kirinyaga, answering maralell. Hear you loud and clear. Over. Hello, bullit. Fletcher Ryan calling. There's some blokes in the north corner of your reserve carrying bows and arrows. Poaching, I think. Over. Thank you. I'll have a look in the morning. Over. Robert. It's me. Can I talk with you a moment? Well, sure. Bullit talked to me about Tina, about her going back with you, and I think he'll help. Did he say he would? Well, not exactly, but at least we talked about it. And if she's to accept the idea and go willingly, I'm sure he will help. And who's going to help you, to part with her? I don't need any help. I've been prepared ever since I wrote you. You're going to let your child walk out of your life, just like that? She can visit me. You'd let her. Visit you? Halfway around the world? No. She'll forget about you the way she forgot about me. Tina has to leave this place. We both know it. What are you trying to do to me? I want you to understand before it's too late that she's going to grow up into a woman, and you're not going to be there. Oh, stop it. How can you be so cruel? I dare not think of myself, but only of her and her future. What else can I do? You can come with me. I can't, Robert. Why not? I promised bullit. So that's bullit's price to help with Tina. Well, you're not going to pay it. I won't let you. If he's going to use Tina to hold you, then I'll use her to get you back because she needs you, and you need her. And I need both of you. I'm still in love with you, Chris. Good night, Robert. Good night. Memsaab! Bwana hayward, he witch doctor. Old man better. Bad luck! You watch him carefully, kihoro. He mustn't leave here. You understand? Old man stay here, even if I have to kill him. Have a drink? Uh, no thank you, John. How did your talk go? Robert believes that you're holding the aces. What do you think? I don't know. I'm too weary to think. No reason to be worried. No card game can go on very long with two players holding all the aces. I pray not. ( Laughing ) Well, hello! Mornings are best, daddy. The very best, baby. I wouldn't miss them for anything. You wouldn't want to leave here, would you, Tina? Daddy! Bwana. Jambo. Jambo. ( Speaking native language ) Dead, daddy. The chief is dead. Yes, dear, I know. ( Speaking native language ) We've been invited to the ceremony for the new chief. May we go? ( Speaking native language ) Now we're in for it. Ouriounga's the new chief, and the old one isn't even dead yet. Maybe we should have told them old kalu is still alive. I'm not that brave, baby. If anyone's gonna do that, it's our honored guest Mr. Hayward. We'd better get back to the house. Anyway, I'm dying to go. So am I. ( All chanting ) ( Chanting continues ) How long do these ceremonies last? All day. All night too, if it doesn't rain. ( All chanting ) Do we have to stick it out? I will. I'm the official guest. It would be an insult if I cut out before the party's over. I want to stay with you, daddy. ( All chanting ) They're telling the story of how old kalu killed his lion. This is the hunt that leads up to the kill. See the lion's mane that ouriounga's wearing? That's his father's, old kalu's. Ouriounga hasn't killed a lion of his own yet. Now they're circling the lion, closing in on him. The lion has to charge the circle to get free, or be killed. In the real thing, warriors get mauled. Some even get killed. Hush, mummy. Watch. ( All chanting ) ( Chanting continues ) ( Spits ) ( Thud ) ( All chanting ) You see? Do you know who those little girls are? They're the brides of warriors. And Tina's beginning to speak and feel like them. ( All chanting ) ( Crying out ) Keep calm. This is just his way of asking for Tina as his bride. It's not meant as an insult. I'm sure it's meant as an honor, but... Why don't we just thank him and leave? I'll handle this my own way, if you don't mind. ( Crying out ) ( Crying out ) ( Speaking native language ) ( Speaking native language ) ( Spectators gasp ) Now the fat's in the fire. He knows who saved his father's life, and his father has called him a false son. Let's go. ( Thunder crashes ) Well, better find kihoro. Find out what it's all about. He's not there, daddy. Tina, darling, come here and stay with me. But, mummy, kihoro's my friend! You must find him, you must! No sign of a struggle, either. You're better off in the compound for a while, baby. ( Ouriounga cries out ) ( Distant thunder rumbles ) He's as dead as he'll ever be. I'm sorry, bullit. Poor kihoro. If you'll lend me a hand, we'll take him back to the compound. Where is Tina? Tina! She can't be left alone. Tina! Tina! ( Distant thunder crashes ) ( Grunts ) ( Low growl ) King! They killed kihoro! I saw it, king, I saw it! ( Speaking native language ) Kill him! ( Growling ) ( Thunder crashes ) ( Speaking native language ) Kill him! Kill him! Kill him, king! Bullit! Tina! ( Tina cries out ) Kill him! Oh, my god! Kill him! Aah! Christine! Come back! Christine: Let me go! Tina! Let me go! Robert: Tina! Tina: Let me go! Ohh! Get out of my line of fire! Robert! Robert! No! No, king, get back! ( King growling ) Get out of the way! No! Daddy, no! ( Gunshot ) ( Distant thunder rumbles ) He's dead. King is dead. So is this one. You killed him. You killed him! You killed my king! I begged you not to! I begged you! Stop it, Tina, stop it. Stop it. It had to be done. I know how much you loved king, but there was no choice. Thanks, sport. But I'm afraid it's a little too much to ask of her. ( Tina weeping ) Come with me. That's a nasty arm. Let's get back and take care of it. Can you manage? I think so. Where will we live in america? That will be for your father to decide. When you're not away at school, you'll probably stay in the apartment in New York or in the farm in Connecticut. Aren't you living with US? I'm not going with you, darling. Tina: Why not? Why aren't you? Why isn't she coming? Tell her why, Christine. Didn't you ask her to come? Oh, Tina, stop it. Ask her. Maybe she will if you ask her. Please ask her! But you'll come back here and visit US on holidays. Tina, darling. No, I won't, I won't! I'll never come back here! I hate this place now! I'm sorry, Chris. I thought I'd found a way out for all of US. There's no way out. Not for me. I think I always knew that. There's an old, old saying that, if you take what you want out of life, be ready to pay for it. I took. And I'm paying. As bullit would say, "right, sport?" You've helped me with Tina. That's what I wanted. And you have my gratitude. And if it's any consolation to you... You have my love. Bullit: Kirinyaga calling Nairobi. Kirinyaga calling Nairobi. Do you read me? Over. Man: Read you loud and clear. Over. Would you be good enough to put the commissioner on, please? Commissioner: Hello, bullit, how are you? How soon can you get a new warden up here, sir? I'm resigning. Over. I'll have to look round and try to find someone to replace you. You know, it's not going to be easy. Over. Thanks. I'd like to ask a favor, sir. Could you get in touch with Kenya air service and have a twin engine up here tomorrow morning? There'll be three passengers for Nairobi. Over. Roger. Well, I hope you'll be one of them. Perhaps I can persuade you to... 'Fraid not. I'm pointing my Jeep in another direction. No airfields where I'm going, sir. But I'll be looking in on you one of these days. Cheerio, sir. Over and out. Thank you, John. Thank you very much. Just being practical. The child wants her mother, the mother wants her husband, the hunter wants to hunt. Just putting the pieces back in their proper place. ( Faint shrieking and chittering ) Why don't you take a look? They're coming with US? Nicholas and simbaline? They're going to live with US in america? Nicholas. Simbaline. Read what it says on the crate. "To miss Tina... "Hayward. "Hayward farm, pound Ridge, "Connecticut, u.S.A. From... John bullit." They no come back, bwana? No, bogo. They no come back. Take good care of the new warden, bogo. You no come back too, bwana? No, bogo, I no come back. Kwa heri. Kwa heri. Kwa heri!
