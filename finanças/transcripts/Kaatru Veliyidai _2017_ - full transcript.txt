I'm going to live here Welcome me like a queen The door's been open since last night And I've been waiting Grandpa! Forgotten me, have you? You smell of hospital Go, shower Better than smelling of old rum VC... Look, you have a guest - Varun, did my father come to see you? - Speak softly This is a hospital There are elderly patients What did you tell my father? He's sending me to Pune Sorry 'I saw your face in the wide ocean' Careful 'I saw your face in the bright blue sky' VC Quoting Bharati in Kashmir? How could you do this to me? You told him it's best for me? 'I saw your face in the sea's churning foam' You can't take the drip out 'In every small bubble, I saw your face' Sorry You can't leave without being discharged You were never serious about me, were you? I was just a pastime for you 'I watched the clouds so keenly' You're selfish, self-centered Arrogant Who, me? Serious accusations 'I watched the clouds' I don't know the next verse Where to, sir? 'I found your face and nothing else' - Where is he going? - To the bathroom There's a patient who needs a bed pan Go, help him Good morning, sir How can we let you fly with that sling? No sling, sir Only a bandage Yes sir I'll be fit to fly in a week, sir - VC, do me a favour - Yes, sir?

Dr Ilyas moved him to the military hospital last night Dr Ilyas How could you move VC without our permission? An IAF officer shouldn't have been there in the first place But he was So? He's our responsibility, doctor No, he's my responsibility You shouldn't have moved him It could've been a head injury With severe blood loss, he was under observation How could you sneak him away? He's an Air Force officer, he flew away So, can't I see the patient now? Ilyas, you were wrong Agreed But try telling VC All I can do is to buy you a coffee Or invite you to the Air Force ball Next weekend! You might see VC there Maybe that will cool the angry young doctor He was my first patient My enthusiasm and concern came out as anger I am very sorry, doctor Your first patient Happily dancing away Dr Leela Didn't thank Dr Leela Slipped out of the hospital Need another chance to thank you right Rendez-vous at 10,000 ft over Srinagar? No civilians on an IAF plane, sorry Private aircraft maybe? A Himalayan joyride? This isn't going to work Why not? Officer, that's a lot of flirting after a simple hello So much? Is it my dancing, flirting or me? What don't you like? Who says I don't? But save your breath It won't work My heart seems to say otherwise I'm a doctor Trust me, hearts don't talk What would convince Dr Leela? Across seven seas, seven hills apart, seven years later if the heart feels the same, then maybe Tall order! If you change your mind No, thanks If you have a change of heart, next Saturday, 5pm Date in flight Is the officer hard of hearing? Won't the doctor have a change of heart? Hello Hello I'm on duty A head injury! Two cardiac cases, an acute appendicitis You startled me No work today? No sortie? In half an hour I wanted to see the doctor who stood me up So long Wait!

Me, or Leela? - Can I ask something? - Please I hesitate to talk about it I told her you wouldn't judge But she would not listen You're sure it's okay? May I? Sure Wouldn't want you to think it's weird that a doctor Don't beat about the bush She likes someone Nidhi! Crazy I haven't told him But she wants to I'm scared What if he laughs? How long can you keep it a secret? He isn't in town The Air Force won't tell us where he is Where's VC? I haven't seen him in days Ilyas looks upset Don't be sad!

I thought about it... ...for a while Imagined a little boy... ...or a girl... ...by my side Sitting on my shoulder Laughing and playing And if they were twins... ...they would be Rohan and Rohini But I have a nagging fear... ...that I'd be like my Dad And be a terrible father Is it a yes or a no? I'm not really cut out... ...to be a husband... ...or a father You're all I need No... I'm not good enough I am unworthy If this is what I want No, Leela It just won't work Don't just walk away in silence I'll handle it How? I'm a doctor I'll take care I've always been self-destructive, reckless... ...you became collateral damage Because you were my other half Destroying was my second nature But it's all behind me now My retribution is only 10 kilometers away I can almost touch Torkham Gate The Afghan border Salaams, sir Yes, that's him! Sir, could you hold him for a minute? Brother... Can I find an auto or a horse-cart to Torkham Gate? Arrest him! If I were to admit that it was all my fault... ...would you believe me?

Okay I get it You don't like me And my relationship with Leela - I'll fetch the rice - Ma'am, wait I'll get it I can sense your silent questions Can he take care of our daughter? You're a renowned lawyer Your questions will be complicated Will I take good care of her? Most definitely But if you ask me if I'm capable? Am I competent? Am I rich? What my social standing is I wouldn't know how to answer that Is this a silent interrogation? Am I in the dock? Yes, Your Honour...No, Your Honour Did I do something wrong? Leela? Not tonight, I didn't I'm the only one laughing Feels like an inquiry In the Forces, only a grave mistake leads to an inquiry My only mistake has been... ...my extreme affection... ...for Leela Are you scared for your daughter? Because I'm in the Air Force? You lost your son Ravi in a sortie that I should have been on Do you hold me responsible for it? Am I a bad omen? Do you think that? Varun, enough Wait! They're trying to say something Looking at me as if I were vermin I'm a fighter pilot I'm hard-wired for combat I can sense animosity in your silence Do you wish I was dead? Prakash, shall I tell you something? You're a criminal lawyer Well acquainted with criminals and cheats Do you take everyone for a fraud? Or have you become one too? Can you please stop this? - One minute - It's okay It's not okay It's not cool He is interrogating me without words Looking at me as if I were a terrorist - Take him outside - Talk to me! Why hide behind them? For God's sake, go Come with me and I'll leave Varun, go...Please Come with me - Like you did the other day - Varun, just go Are you telling me to get out?
