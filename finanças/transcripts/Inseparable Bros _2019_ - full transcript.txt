What do you do on weekends? We must meet - You have to stay with your family on weekends. - I wonder how - As a priest you have many families. - Right. Your mother will definitely do it too. This is all I can do. Don't see me again. Whoever has to take responsibility, Maria is born. Responsible for living to the end. Do you want to meet your new friends? Let's go - Stop it already - You're brave. I didn't know the pain was more than a mild stroke. You don't know that, I hit it but it doesn't hurt at all. I said to stay away from him damn it. Bloody What are you really doing? Afraid that we have no impact. I'm really not sick. Do it again Do it right. Right, you think I'm gonna die. Not up enough. In my experience. Gimbap is very delicious. Hey, talent is 19 degrees. Practice .. You can show us the best. Let's eat Wait a minute In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Give us the food you threw away. The priest must go find money. How do I look? Ok I'll be right back Where? Se-ha ... Se-ha ... Se-ha ... There they are! Truly.. Dong-Goo Dong-Goo ... Dong-Goo ... I'll go there. Hurry up.. INSEPARABLE BROS - Wake up. Come on wake up .. - Come fast hurry up .. What is your name? Park Shin Bu. - Sis? - Kang Se-ha / - Kang Se-ha - That's right, so what to do? - So what should I do? - If someone asks you to get something delicious. - Ooh really? - You like that? - I do not like it. - If someone is stupid, it does not meet the criteria. - You dare to fight me Yes, but if we ignore it, it's very scary. Flush it - Let's go to the swimming pool. - I understand Looks like I'm not talented to be a reporter. The bride who will be one forever in God is not common sense. I have no words. - Alright, Dong-Goo pour it. - Well You're a priestly ordination. - Brides also tend to be independent. - I think it's a bit strange too. According to the newspaper, I have to shout that. Makes sense, and should give us an impression. Wouldn't people give a lot of donations? - It's been a long time. You haven't eaten eggs? Isn't that right Dong-Goo? - Yup Stop drinking This is my soul medicine. - Dong-Goo, pour more. - Well - Dong-Goo you have to submit it. - Hey Dong-Goo, pour more. Hand it over. Today I want to tell the bride and groom. Love only one person forever. Not.. Disappointed only for one person forever. Yes.. In fact, like his heart, love too .. ... it's not always eternal. But love can last forever, if you accept the mistakes of others and bear them. Do not be disappointed with love, but love the disappointment of others. Because we are all hurt and weak, we often disappoint others and then give up. For this reason, if there is someone who accepts and understands that mistake. We can live with strength again. When you are alone ... meet other people to help each other and live. For two people. You know the place. Sis ... - Reverend leave? - With peace. He is out of water. No, he became a star in the sky and watched us. My mother also became a star. You might have met your father. My mother too. Your mother. He will come back if he listens. Listen to the same phrase. Right, let's sleep. - Sis - What's wrong? Will you leave? Who pushed the wheelchair. How can I leave. Good night, sister Next.. How much will you do? I can not do it. I can not do it. Let him write it. Check first. - Please fill in. - What do you mean? - It's okay - You can use this instead. - You have to stamp here to make sure ... - Dong-Goo took that ... The color is green, although it's not flat enough to fit in your hand. It's as thick as your thumb, like a candy cane and the tip is round like a head. No, thin and not too big on paint. There is an eraser at the end, and one sharp edge and hidden surface. . Openings ... Seal it. The color is short black. Look for the right one. How about doing this? The rest are donations, not trauma. So you can spend time voluntarily. I just need an assessment of school work. So like that. I am a professional. Please tell me. I will write to you how much ... 5000 won for each student assignment evaluation 100,000 won for 20 hours The service report is 30,000 won separately. 20,000 won to feed 30,000 won or photos. - Then. - Next - English certificate - Yes I ... Okay, then tell your mother I'm from Stanford. I can't get a good job, so I want to strengthen my service specifications. I need a lot of services, I'll do it cheap. Alvaro what. I have something to translate. Then can you write a service review? That's a creative area, so I need skills. Sad and funny Can't the two of them be combined? Then that translates to 500,000 in 200 hours. - Do you need a photo? - I need that. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Crazy is a person who needs a career to contribute, give and take but looks so good. The concept I'm talking about is your disability. Also, Seongmin, feels that I did this because my brother got a donation ... Decide to cancel the application here. - What? Why? - You're not his father? How can I provide support? The newspaper said that the 7th class social welfare official was responsible for people with disabilities ... In China it is said to be a group of uninformed youth, telling them to die. You must be very cold. The environment also comes and goes cool. Advances are paid to rent. So we were transferred to another facility. I can now stand and sleep without having to take responsibility. I'm very thankful .. thank you .. I really can't understand the situation. However, it will fall with Dong-Goo. I think Dong-Goo, a person with a disability, will go to a different facility ... I tried to stop it, but there was no way. I said don't touch the evaluator. I can not today. Let's see it every day. But not today. Then, it should not be fashionable. Look Kim. If water does not enter this way, it will fly out of your head. What strength does Alba have? If you're a contestant or swimsuit, sit here. - Do it. - Not. Mi-Hyun Yes, here Hyun How do you know the phone number? Let's drink coffee and talk. The phone number is ... There is something that must be seen as a matter of discrimination. Pool staff took care of him. Green personal information is not included. Alba's pool is over. Do you know what Alba is doing? I will go to the swimming competition on the 4th of next month. Practice as a trainer and pacemaker. See our basketball swimming skills. To win prizes. - How much is the honorarium? - How long have you been Alba? You have to fill in service specifications and get a full time job. If the story is won on the map of disabled swimmers, it looks like a complex sport. Greedy. - Write a construction report? - Write a construction report and I'll stamp. This time it's fast. I'm late for everything. According to the Human Rights Charter for people with disabilities, I don't know if there have been tests for the Human Rights Charter in the past All people with disabilities must have flexibility in the registration deadline by considering There are many people because this pool is 50 meters in size. Some people returned five minutes later. I have business at the town hall. Have you ever ... need services among others? - By the way, I'm single when taking care of it. - Follow me. Faster. What are you doing now Achieve elevator with wheelchair gravity acceleration. I want to ask you to participate. Like stickers and buraura. By the way, there is no violation ... I don't want to at all. Look at this, Woah .. because we are people with disabilities you have the heart to do this. Right ... The deadline was late because I was disabled. Disabled, after all, we are disabled Mi-Hyun called the neighborhood office and also gave me a call for the disabled and NHRCK. - But how to do that? - By taking Photos .. Photos .. Photos .. Okay, I want your attention, please take a photo as proof. Dolphins don't learn to swim. We humans basically can swim. You live on the ground and your sense of swimming is contaminated. Learning is a pure soul. Like a dolphin, his swimming skills are not polluted. The person who navigates through water, intellectually handicapped is Park Dong-Goo. People who make energy for a purpose. So that people with disabilities can be said to be strong. Life is their life and that of others They are in crisis and in danger of being separated from each other. This time trying to win the competition to prove why they have to live together Damn Dong-Goo, fighting! - What is wrong? - Why? Why did you stop? - Even though it's already good. Why stop? - Nevermind So why are you stupid? What are you doing? You gonna hit me? Stop it already, take part in the Northeast Asia Games. Sudukuk cannot accommodate people who are not disabled. However, you managed to attract people's attention. Only by winning prizes. No prizes, no local newspapers will be interviewed. So swimming is the right thing. I can't teach you how to go. I made an excuse. And with wealth. Dong-Goo isn't so flattered by your money. What? Say it. Good work. In that case. How old am I, Dong-Goo and I are talking about it. I know this is annoying. I will do well. I will not forget - I will not forget - Calm Calm Where did you go today? I'm Park Bong, but I filmed a lot today. Done Pineapple, Beer, Ribs, Canned Tuna Cheers Next Next OK Flag, next day. Gone today. I'll be to the end. Understand? Promise. Promise Sis, sorry I will do well next time. - Dong Goo. Do you have something on your mind? - I am thinking. - What is that? - Mother. That's because, I suddenly remembered. Alright, sleep. Sis, wheelchair to the neck. Turn around. So, you should at least carry it wherever you go, like me. Play it well. Let it go so we can have fun together. Brother Se-Ha, really likes it. One time, the girl I liked in high school was kind to me. - Then? - I revealed. - ... cool. - Until now? I haven't served since the following day. I want to kiss if there is an improvement later on. At appointment. Late I want to run while lamenting. - Brother Dong-Goo, I went to the pool a few times. - Why? I will use it again. To live with Dong-Goo I have to have a job no matter what. I am not going to. Alright, please pay attention, we are the people who came to take you to your new home. Please cooperate. Are you Kang Se-Ha? - Yes. - Then Park Dong-Goo? Except for you two, you have to go to another facility. Agreement. Hello. This must be on schedule. Here.. If you guys later ... Brother, our brother must unite everything. - Stop it - Are you crazy? Why me, why? I'm also having a hard time. Just bring it. Just take my word! Construction starts tomorrow. You two must go. - Don't forget the wheelchair. - Of course not. Meanwhile, the elevator is revived. Not alone with friends like before. - Dong-Goo, I'll take you again, but it's hard to let you live on the third floor forever. - First floor. If you make it bigger than you think in the bathroom, it will be recycled. I still don't eat chicken, no matter how much I eat. Clean and healthy. You are the first people to enter my house. Dong-Goo, it's better for them to leave. You sleep in this house so you can be independent, the hardest thing here is to escape quickly. I just watched it. I don't like dirty things. Dong-Goo, don't do it, I'll do it. You also applied for an electric wheelchair now. Think about it slowly. And the apartment. If the two conditions, then the advertisement specifically for people with disabilities is high. But, you need a deposit of 10 million won. Can I borrow a guarantee from the resident center? Don't worry too much. Also, you have to have a job to be independent. Work.. Let's find it together. I will write it from the marked place there. Can I use a welfare card? - Who are you, by the way? - I'm Chairman Shin. If you see this sign, there will be users on this planet. Little times. This is a theater outing. Wow great.. To the room. We are 30 is a lifetime Clothing. It's not right to take it off. I continued to walk and walk in place. In particular I'm not happy. That's not a cool girl. There is no power. I just pretend to be strong. My brothers told me that I live looking weak. The priest also did that. Weak people must live together. It's actually strong because we can live together. The priest was drunk and was told. I still don't know yet. Then why was it announced. Never mind, forget it. Let's walk together. Most people, coming to the disabled, carry the stamp of ignoring inheritance ..to help me or put him on the family register as a parent. - A young friend is not enough evidence. - It really isn't That's much longer than it looks So, I just saw this photo and talked with Dong-Goo. How do you recognize my child? Get a genetic test if you need it. When it was time to throw Suhyun's bag, why did he only come now? We have also applied for an apartment to live independently. - May I ask? - What is that? I, did it because of the woman I work for. So far we have been feeding, washing, dressing, pushing a wheelchair, going to the bathroom and watching football. Aunt. I will get hurt if you tell me that you left him. Whose mom is telling lies all the time? But now you come. Who is actually harassing? Why do you say that We will talk later. I will leave right now. Whatever Dong-Goo wants, please listen. Dong-Goo Here, there's something Dong-Goo likes ... Mother directly made this. Like the past. Dong-Goo You remember what mother made. Playing with the dough, Dong-Goo waits by the pool. That is not mother. Dong-Goo eats well. I'm good at school. I am waiting. I am waiting. I'm really sorry. I did it wrong Right now I want to be with you again ... Dong-Goo ... Dong-Goo ... That auntie wants to make an adult guardianship claim. Adult guardianship. What do you mean by all that? More important than that, psychology. Good luck in court at the end of July. After all, living together is family. Ten thousand people. We were there because the dogs did not have a family. Take care of your family well. Then why was the boar hit by his father? I've never seen your face. That's why I'm telling you I'm not. That is not their family. After all, living together is the most important thing living with the person I want. With age - Welcome. What would you like to order? - Two glasses of Americano and a glass of orange juice. Please give me a large size. Do you want ice for the coffee? Or do you want warm water? Please put two ice. Will you turn it over? I will accept it after eating here. - How long have the two lived together? - Several years Park Dong-Goo you lived together before. Who do you want to live with? What did you do at that time? - Jang Jung-seok - That's my mother's name. Dong-Goo, that should be answered as soon as the question arises. - If I ask as usual, who do I want to live in peace with? - I want to live with you. - I want to live with Jung Soon. - No, that's not it. Kang Jung Soon Dong-Goo - We become fun and funny people. With whom? - Sis - What's your brother's name? - Se-Ha Wow, Dong-Goo is smart Dong-goo Do you want to live with Se-Ha? Look at Brother Dong-Goo looking at you relatively. As you can see in the photo, the two have been together for a long time. Your Honor, I will ask Mr. Sung Suk-tae, as a witness. Witness, how do you know Park Dong-Goo? - I'm a junior from an instructor. - Junior? When I do something else, I study late after more than 30 years. What is your relationship since then? Since then, I have worked in the neighborhood office and have been the official in charge of the facilities where Kang Soo-yeon lives. As a person who has been watching for a long time, how is their relationship? I think they are a very good example of two people with physical disabilities and intellectual disabilities ... who live together to meet their gaps. Your Majesty, I've had enough. This is proof that Jang Jung-Soon is actively visiting his son Park Dong-Goo. Public swimming ... is it your will that Dong-Goo participates? People who are not disabled are not unusual people. That is my will. Please bring the evidence that has been prepared. - You're not using Park Dong-Goo to solve operational problems right now? - Not. - Brother Dong-Goo is good, I really like it, - Your Honor, I request an additional witness. - Okay, please. - I'm a prospective worker from Stanford University. We serve at social institutions owned by lecturers. What service did you do there? - I'm a translator. - Are you a translator? Other volunteers. I translated the service report I requested at a foreign university. I mastered English. - What next? - I accept voluntary time. I promised 5,000 won per hour to volunteer and give 500,000 won for the 100 hour package. The instructor is immoral when collecting money, using what he can do as a handicapped person. I want to ask. Does this person deserve to be Park Dong-Goo's legal guardian? Quiet. Please do not be noisy. I will postpone the trial. The trial will continue on July 10 at 10 a.m. Hey damn it - Yes - That sucks Who? Hello I'll do this for a minute. But I'm talking to an alternative lawyer. What if I enter without saying this? Nice to meet you before the trial tomorrow. I'm sorry, I'll leave after this. Dong-Goo is hungry with me. Dong-Goo I'm trying to cook Dong-Goo's favorite food. - So I'll be very happy - How about ramen Dong-Goo is growing well. Ramen is Dong-Goo's favorite food. It hurts if I throw it early. I have many things to say. With confidence to throw it away. How nice to live with you, if you don't know anything all day long. Therefore, I do this. Actually, I haven't done anything for 20 years since I left my child. I'm doing this because I want to. But, how many rights. We have to live if Dong-Goo lives forever. It must be good in it. Dong-Goo Don't scream Apologize to him. - Park Dong-Goo, who do you want to stay with? - Kang Se Ha - Who is Kang Se-Ha? - My older brother. - My brother Park Dong-Goo who want to live with? - Kang Se Ha Why do you want to live with Kang Se-Ha? - Because it is very fun when with him. - Right - Can you say this? - I'm not stupid. Right, Dong-Goo isn't stupid at all. - Hello - You have to spend time with me. I have nothing to eat. Even though I'm not angry. - Jang Jung-soon. Is it true that you threw away your son, Park Dong-Goo? - Right. Why did you throw it away? Father suddenly died. I have a long way to live like I'm dead. Then split up. I think it will be good. Where did you leave Park Dong-Goo? I left it at the Dongdaemun pool. Have you ever lived with a family that has intellectual limitations like Park Dong-Goo? - No. - With children. Living together. If it becomes sandy. There is more health. Objection! Now lawyers threaten us with the best costumes. Yes objection is accepted. Kang Se Ha. When you were two years old, you fell into a grave and destroyed three broken cervical vertebrae .. When you were 10 years old, your mother died and moved to some relatives' house. Next to the former social welfare center, meet with Park Dong-Goo. Where did you do your personal life well? If you don't die, who will you stay with? - My mother is dead. - Right Kang Se-Ha, you are also a certified social worker instructor. Is that true? Yes It is common for people with disabilities to live with people with disabilities. Not.. In your opinion, which one is more desirable, living with a family with no disabilities? You are a lawyer. Born to choose a family. It doesn't matter whether you live with a disability or not. If they live together, it might get burned. Isn't that really dangerous? If there is a fire, you have to report it. Is it not dangerous for people who are not disabled to burn? That's my mother We do not wrap the heartbeat with love. The family is better and the economic situation is better than at home. Why perfect people need tools. My father did it. Weak people help and live. Weak people can help others. If you think for yourself, you will die. If you think the same way, you won't die. If Dong-Goo plays basketball, Dong-Goo also uses me. If I'm having a hard time, Dong-Goo will help me. Therefore, we love each other. Kang Se-Ha, thank you Finally, Park Dong-Goo. I will ask you. Your Honor, Park Dong-Goo is intellectually handicapped at around 5 years old. Also, mentally dominated by Kang Se-Ha, Park Dong-Goo is an adult, and in this paper, your rhythm is important to be Park Dong-Goo's guardian. - Lawyer, is there anything else? - Not Alright, can you see here. - What is your name? - Park Dong Goo. Then, I will ... According to Park Dong-Goo who should be the legal adult guardian? I'm sorry, I'll repeat it. Park Dong-Goo wants to live with anyone? It's hard to say yes. Park Dong-Goo, then let's seduce. Please help me here. Park Dong-Goo, look and listen to the audience. Now people can see it. I ask. Park Dong-Goo, pointing his finger at the person who wants to live with him. Do you know? Now, Park Dong-Goo with whom do you want to stay? - What is Park Dong-Goo doing, Se-Ha Sis, what happened? - Your Honor judge. Say slowly one more time. Please ask Once again please. Your Honour. Shut up Let's see if it's an illusion or not. Sit down Park Dong Goo The person who is appointed now. Do you know who? mother Father lost a new way for each bride's peace name. Then what should I do?

I haven't seen it since it was posted on the company website Right, it says here: Bad volunteers and poets act too recklessly and frankly ... but really want to serve people with disabilities. And when we are with him, we often forget that we are disabled. - What does it mean? - That... It seems forgetful. Name of Volunteer Service, This is the house of responsibility. What does this mean?
