It just-- it doesn't happen in France, it doesn't happen in Brazil or Florida or California. Just--Hawaii's real different like that. It's a place that definitely brings everyone together.

Between Haleiwa and Pipeline, those are the two waves on the North Shore I think that bring the best out in what I have to offer, surfing-wise. Couple of contest guys practicing. Which is funny, 'cause it's-- it'll be a lot bigger than this but maybe just getting a feel for it and you can kinda get in the line-up and see-- and kinda get in the ocean and feel your line-ups a little bit. When we're sitting out there, we look back up at different trees and buildings and stuff and you-- you get your-- you kinda get two points and you make a straight line and get your line-up, you know. And if you get one point over there, one line that way and one line that way and you triangulate and you know exactly where you are on the reef. Pretty basic way to line yourself up out there. This year I've entered Haleiwa. I don't generally surf the whole Triple Crown but I'm surfing the event this year. Luckily, thankfully, I'm surfing it because, um, the swell forecast looks really good. It's probably the best forecast I've seen for Haleiwa in years for the event, so I'm super excited. [dramatic music] narrator: A strong showing at the event at Haleiwa could offer Slater a dose of renewed confidence heading into Pipeline in a few week's time, following a 2019 season that so far has fallen well short of his own lofty standards. - Kelly Slater-- oh, just unable to finish off there. - To be in tenth coming into the last event? I don't know. I'm not happy with it. [chuckles] - Lining up for the alley-oop on the end section-- - No! - Not quite enough for Kelly. - I can think back on, like, either a wave or a heat I had at a couple events where I felt like I'd kind of started getting my stride a little bit, but I'd have to say I'm not real happy with my performance. - Slater really seems focused and he's chasing a big number here. That wave just not cooperating. - Last five events--I've won all those events before and the best I did in the last five--it was ninth place, so I look back at that and I'm like, "I don't know if I could surf those five events again all in a row and do as bad as I just did." That's how it feels to me. What's up, Marty? - What's up, Kelly? - What's goin' on, guys? narrator: The truth is that those results only matter so much to many locals here. And some 48 hours before he's scheduled to attack the Haleiwa waves in competition, his presence on the beach, as per usual, attracts the attention of some of the North Shore's youngest surfing aficionados. - Boogie board. - What's up, bud? Hey, what's up? - Hi. [laughs] - [laughs] - High five. - Hi.

This one is set to crown a champion in 13 days or less. - But with those two big maneuvers on that set wave, you gotta think he could possibly go from third to first. narrator: That champion will come out of a field that includes North Shore locals as well as world-class performers pointed towards the Pipe Masters. As qualifying begins, there are plenty of impressive riders, but also one conspicuously absent. Because of his World Tour ranking, Kelly Slater doesn't have to enter the draw until its third round. And so while much of the rest of the field competes, he's a few miles north where the waves are a bit gentler and he can stay in rhythm with the ebbs and flows of Oahu's shoreline. - You know, I'm sort of imagining what would happen if I got cleaned up.

He learned to surf in Bali. I sent a picture of this board to Bill and he wrote me back. He said, "That guy looks like he needs a leash." This is my favorite. This is the cock rock...

These are three of my trophies from Pipe Masters wins. Best trophy in surfing. If I win this year, it's just gonna go right next to that one. This picture kinda haunts me because... I think it was the best wave I've ever seen at Pipeline and I could've caught it. This wave was coming and I was like, "This is the wave I've waited my whole life for. That's the one." And I just couldn't figure out how to catch it and not kill myself. That's a reminder. Every time you go out there make sure if that wave ever comes your way, you don't miss it.
