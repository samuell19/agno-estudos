. . The cape reports an unidentified object over the launch sector. All planes should've been out of that area twenty minutes ago. It's been identified. TransCom Flight Number 12 straight off course. Will that hold up the launch? No, he'll be clear before the shoot. Three minutes... Thirty seconds. Better be clear. That little baby cost us fifty million bucks! It'd be just great if she sideswiped an airliner with the stuff she's got inside. Three minutes! Control power off. We'll pick her up right after first orbit, and activate all sensors. With the laser communciation link activate the second orbit, we're in. You know, it's strange. After all this time and money and work... ... the laser satellite is finally ready to go. Time! They're in the terminal position. Our scanners are locked on. We're ready to assume control any time after third stage burnout. Good. I can't see anyone now. Sir, we have to call off this launch. We're committed. We can't abort. You know how many times I've advised the government against this particular shoot. I've said it since I hear that the experimental missile program... ... and it's in every one of my papers on the subject. You've had a remarkable career, Keith. Every stalactic honor and degree. We need ya here. And I'm sorry for what's happened between you and the powers that be, but... - I just can't -- - The world is full of facts. But besides being a friend of mine, I also have a great deal of respect for you. But you haven't convinced anyone that this particular project... ...is a menace to the safety of the world. What happened to the first secret major communication satellite, the small one? It exploded its own orbit. - Anyone know why? - No. Wrong! I do. It was a warning. A warning from the other planets to keep the Earth in its place. To keep us 'incomunicado' until we're further advanced. I predicted that fully three years before the satellite was launched. You know there's no proof of any other life on those planets. I don't have any proof either. But I'm telling you this... Alien intelligence watches us constantly. They don't feel we're ready to join in... ... the great brotherhood of the countless galaxies. They'll do something, anything, to keep us from communicating. I'm here to ask you... to BEG you to save your world. The problem has become an academic question. For your generation, yes. Martha, that dinner was delicious. Did you bake the pie yourself? Oh, sure. An old family recipe my grandmother sold at her bakery. Keith, you need some more coffee? Half a cup, 'hon'. Keith, you're acting rather smug. You look like a man who's just inherited a major portion of the world. You might not be so far wrong, in a way of speaking. Keith... Yes, dear? I know. I bet you finally decided there was nothing to worry about with the laser satellite. Hardly. It's still of great interest to me. Among other things. Well, it's been up there three months now, with no dire effects. Twenty feet in diameter, in high orbit... ... traveling around the Earth at about eighteen thousand miles an hour. Look, can't you two talk about anything else? I'm tired of hearing about laser satellites and isotopes... ... and conical graduation and all the rest. Maybe you have something in your space technology I can use for a headache. Keith, you're hinting at something. What is it? I can't tell you right now... She thinks I'm off my rocker. Everyone thinks you're off you're rocker. Even me. Now come on, what's the big secret? - Well -- - Keith... Please! Honey, this is too big. I've got to tell someone. But you promised! Curt will understand. Maybe nobody else on Earth, but Curt will understand it. Well, I'll try. Come on into the den. Don't let it get you down, Martha. Say, that's a powerful looking set. I've never seen anything like it before. Where'd ya get it? Come on, I'll help ya clear the table. It'll be just a second. I got a second. There it is. Do you have any idea what it is... What you're actually hearing? Some kind of progressive jazz? It's Venus. By laser communication, without the satellite. Oh, come on now, Keith. Venus. I don't mean the static. Can't you hear it, the other thing? What other thing? Listen to it, Curt! Listen to the voice. Oh, stop it, Keith! If it is a voice, it's unintelligible. Forget it! Curt, listen to me. I've been in constant communication with them now for over two months. I don't know exactly how I understand, but it's a form of hyperspace hypnotism. I do know that I do understand. Alright, Keith, so you got a little friend on Venus. What does he want from us? Has he got a name? Or is it just an it? Or maybe it's a she? I'm sorry you don't believe me, Curt. He knows exactly what he wants and he's about to make a move to get it. And although his name is untranslatable through any known Earth language... ... it would sound something like... Zontar. Hello? Yes, this is Curt. What? Why, that's impossible! Alright, I'll be right over. Anne! Nothing wrong at the installation, is there? It's gone! What's gone? The satellite, simply vanished! Wonderful, so what can we do about it? What is it, Curt? There's trouble at the installation, honey. We're gonna have to leave. - Well, good night. - I'll get your coat. - Good night, Keith. - Good night, Curt. I always thought Keith was a little off, but now he's really gone off the deep end. Keith's a genius, alright. Maybe too much so for his own good this time. He did it. Zontar diverted the satellite from a vehicle. He'll soon be here. Zontar will soon be on Earth. Situation the same, sergeant? Yes, sir! General ain't so happy tonight. I guess none of 'em are. Raise the barrier on the C-band link. We might could see something. Well? It's a full decibel now. Everything seems to be operating correctly. But there's just nothing there! I don't understand it. Understand it? Of course not. No one understands it, but it's the scientific achievement of the century. Dear, things will be better soon. Very much better. But you promised. Oh, Keith, please come out of it. Please come back to me. 7.6402 tower, negative. Maybe a link failed. I'm sorry, doctor. That's alright, ladies. We know it wasn't anybody's fault. But be sure to get those reports to Washington tonight, by scrambled transmission. Yes, sir. Wait! Look here, Curt! It's back! It's just reappeared! The data link is operating just as if it were never gone! It's right on orbit, functioning perfectly. Get the Pentagon on the hotline. Tell 'em we're bringing the satellite down for a full examination. Yes, sir. Can you handle the recovery procedures yourself, John? Oh, yes. It's all programmed on the Cycloid computer. All we need to do is activate it. - Good. Good night, then. - Good night, doctor. This is Richie. Acknowledge. I receive you. Yes? Yes, it's true. I am your only friend. Nobody else even believes you exist. But they will. They will. It's late, Keith. Aren't you coming to bed? Zontar's on his way, darling. He drew the satellite to Venus, boarded and returned it to orbit. All within an hour. He's inside that circling laboratory right now waiting to come down to us. To save us. The greatest day in history is about to dawn. Please come to bed, Keith. You need some sleep and you need it badly. But you've gotta snap out of this fantasy you've built up! It's not fantasy! It's what I've been predicting for years. And it's good instead of evil. My one uncertainty was whether it would be for good or for evil. And it's for good. I'm going to stay by the set tonight. I need to be here when Zontar lands. There's still a great deal I don't know about him. Whatever you say, Keith. Good night. 'Night. Are you people positive you know what you're doing? Oh, I think we can manage without wrecking it. This Cycloid computer just doesn't make mistakes. What am I worried about? I'm not paying for it. They're ready at the Cape, sir. Yes, Mr. Secretary. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It'll be done. Well, that's it. All clear. Bring her down. Roger. Thirty seconds. Positions. Forty-two north. Fifty-eight minutes. Check. Fifty-nine minutes. Forty-three north. Locking and locked. Computer now programming to burn. Four cycle while entering atmosphere. Too fast! It can't be heavier. What's the matter with that blasted thing? Six cycle. Shouldn't be past four by now. Something wrong? I don't know, general. It's setting its own course. It's almost as if it had a mind of its own. Everything is engaged. It's just abandoning its own orbit. This just can't be happening! Exactly what's going on here? I don't know, general. It's eerie. It's not acting on our control signals. Send it back up. Don't mess around with it! I don't think we can, general. She's setting her own pattern. Or it certainly seems like it. Well, what's going to happen to it? I don't think I wanna know. Get Washington again, Alice. Yes, sir. Scramble 2 on the hotline. We've just lost all contact. Radar and sensor. Yes. Yes, I hear you. Martha! - What is it, Keith? - Come in here. He's here, darling. Zontar landed the satellite in a cave. They couldn't even track 'em! Keith! The world has been headed downhill for a long time. Wars, larger bombs, but now it will be over. All our dreams for perfection will now be realized. - Zontar will be back! - Stop it, Keith! I've got to phone Curt. He must know. No! Please don't tell anyone what it is that you're imagining! I'm going into town. Yes, that's right. That cave is in the mountains about six miles from here. As you predicted, it is over a hot spring... ... which should make it somewhat compatible with your Venus environment. What's the matter? I don't know. I've got plenty of gas. I'll have a look. Odd. The car clock stopped, too. Hello? Hello! Hello? What's come over this place? Why has everything gone dead? There's been a massive power failure somewhere. We'll have it fixed in a few minutes. The hotline's dead, general. Careful, general, there's a half million volts in there. What happened to the satellite? I don't know. It must be down somewhere. I don't understand it. It just couldn't disappear! Gone. Fifty million dollars and a million hours' work. I can't find anything wrong. Well, what are we going to do? Keith's house's not far from here. We'll have to walk. Curt, the strangest thing happened. Both my watch and the car clock stopped at five after three. I wonder why. Coincidence. No, I've got a premonition. Oh, don't be foolish. Come on. Yours dead, too? Yes. I don't understand it. What's gone on around here? I don't know. Radio, TV, even the wire services are cut. It's like... it's like the town's hanging in mid-air. - Mrs. Richie... - Yes? Your husband said this thing was going to happen someday. Does he know what's going to happen next? I don't know. I really don't know. Yes. I have the names of the control units in this immediate area. The mayor of Jackson is Sidney Parker. The chief of police is Brad Crenshaw. They're very important for controlling the town. The chief security officer of the installation is General Matt Young... ... and the head of the laser project is Dr. Curt Taylor. Along with their wives, that's eight people. All that's necessary for complete control of this area. As I understand it, you're now hosting eight control devices. Is this correct? I would like to see one of the inject-a-pods. They actually grow as part of you, and separate on command, don't they? Fantastic! Now, I have the general locations of the control units. My husband is in an iron lung. Stop, what shall I do? You can operate it by hand, I think. Keep bay. I'll get help. Come on, I've got the car parked at the edge of town. But no cars are running. Ours is. It's not been deenergized. Come on. Curt, what's that? I don't know, but I don't like it. Ugly thing! Obscene looking. I've never seen anything like it. Neither have I. Let's go. We'll never get there standing here. What do you mean, our car has not been deenergized? Zontar stopped all power at its source. That means steam, water, electricity, combustion engines. Everything. Water? You mean the faucets won't work? - That's right. - That's ridiculous! I thought you said it wouldn't work. Of course it works. It belongs to me. Zontar stopped the power selectively. We're not affected. Come on in. Keith, our car broke down. Could you run me over to Phil's garage? Well, I'm afraid that wouldn't do you any good. But I will ask you inside for a drink. You will come in? A drink I could use. I'll get some ice. What's your pleasure? Oh, scotch and soda's alright. Oh, my feet! Just put some ice in a bucket for me. What time did your car stop running? A little after three. You know, my watch and the car clock stopped at the same time. Keith, how did you know the car stopped running? Could've been a broken axle or anything. Could have. It just stopped running like every car did today. Like everything mechanical did. Keith, what's going on? What's all the mystery? You know something you're not telling us? Relax. You have time. Time for explanations. Perhaps even time for understanding. You heard anything from the general? No, sir. Not since he left for headquarters an hour ago. Did he take the jeep? No. The jeep don't work. So he walked. Funny seeing the general walk. He hardly knows how! Things still snafu inside? Yeah, power still off. Funny thing, too. The auxiliary has a hand crank. And even that doesn't work. I wonder what effect this power failure has on my wife's big mouth! Well, let me know if you hear anything from the general. We're all puzzled. And just a little bit afraid. Yeah, sure. Gimme that. Keith, I'm sorry. I can't believe anything of what you're saying. That doesn't surprise me, nor does it dismay me. No one ever believed me. Alright, Keith. Alright. Let's say, just for the moment, that what you're saying is true. That a creature called Zontar has come from Venus. And has shut down the world's power... ... and is putting the world's population under its dominance. Now, if that is true... Why aren't you fighting it? Because this superior intelligence, this Zontar, is working with me. After all, I was his first contact. And I contacted him. I believe he's here to save us from ourselves. Not to dominate us as you have so quickly concluded. Keith, you talk as if this 'thing' were a personal friend of yours. Oh, yes. They're real chums. The days when people made fun of me are over. And he's here to help us save ourselves? From what? FROM ourselves, Curt. From ourselves. Oh. I didn't... I didn't know we needed rescuing. Curt, I'm serious! Remember your theory on free magnetic gravitation? What happened to it? It was a great theory. Well, you know, Keith. Washington red tape. I couldn't get an appropriation. Curt, that was sheer stupidity! An example of how arrogance and ignorance restrain man's progress. I should know, I've been victimized by it myself. And Zontar's gonna end all this? Yes. Quickly, easily. You'll hardly realize it's been done. How's he gonna do it? How's Zontar gonna pull this off? I can't tell you just yet, Curt. It's premature for his plan. Premature. But you'll understand everything pretty soon. I don't think so, Keith. I don't think so. Well, I'd have to take a long, hard look at anything that would change the world so completely. Zontar or whatever. Look, Keith, would you run me over to the lab? It's useless going there. The lab is completely inoperative. Alright, then, will you run us home? Sure. I'll be with ya in a minute. I knew Curt wouldn't panic. Nothing quite like a logical, orderly, scientific mind. He didn't panic because he didn't believe you. Logic makes him think you're insane! Get off my back, Martha! I've overlooked and forgiven your lack of faith for years. But now that events have indicated me, it's time you stood up to be counted. I'll stand up with you, Keith. Not because of events. But because I love you. Were you in contact? Good. You can trace my car through the energy pulses you supply. That will lead the inject-a-pods to him. He will be most difficult. But his mind is of the utmost value to us. Everything under control, men? Yes, sir. As well as can be expected. Under the circumstances. I have a top secret twist, from Washington. This whole area has been placed under martial law. You mean...? I am in command. And we will proceed immediately to prepare defense measures. - Against what? - Don't ask questions. This place is to be abandoned. Sergeant, I want you to assemble the entire guard force. Have them ready to move out at 16:30 hours. With full equipment. It will be a forced march. Yes, sir. It will be a reconnaissance and holding patrol. You will take a position south of Sutton Ridge... ... and observe the area to the east. Regardless of the circumstances... ... you are to take no action but will be required only to send me hourly reports... ... by courier. Beggin' the general's pardon, sir. How we supposed to know when it's 4:30? All our watches have stopped. Here, take mine. It started running again. Now assemble your patrol and move out. Oh, General Young, any news? Yes. Big news. We're in the midst of a communist uprising of some kind. They've sabotaged every known source of power in the area. Seem to have disrupted all communications. What? How'd they manage to get all power sources at once? Well, I can understand them managing to blow the big electric and water plants... ... but none of our generators here are working. Don't ask me. I know they did it, don't know how. How did you get the message? Radio and wire is dead as everything else. Special courier, managed to slip through from headquarters' command. You are all restricted to this building... ... until the emergency is over. Do you mean we're prisoners? Let us say you're all under protective custody. They'd love to get their hands on you and your knowledge of that satellite. Well, there's blankets and canned goods in the closet there. We'll make out. Not comfortably, but we'll do it. I'll see that supplies are sent over. Remember, you're not to go outside that door. Well, guess we've got a link that's hard to break. Well, at least you get a day off. Your sense of humor's kinda strange today, honey. Dead? Try the light. Curt... Curt, I hesitate even to suggest it... But do you think Keith could be right? Well, anything's possible. But I don't think so. It's that he seemed to know about it. He expected it. Look, Anne. I've known Keith for over fifteen years. He has one of those intellects that allows him to make calculated guesses. Now if you make ten thousand wild guesses, one of them's likely to come true. Well, maybe this one has! I mean, he seems so positive, so confident. Look, Anne. You're letting the loss of power, together with the loss of the satellite... ... allow you to believe this is logical. We'll find a reason for this. A massive loss of power, or some other natural catastrophe. But Keith sees in it some reflection of one of his fantastic ideas. Don't you see? It vindicates him for a time. I see. Sort of a chance to regain face. Exactly. But the sad part of it is that Keith really believes this. He really thinks he's talking to something from Venus. Something named Zontar. I just got home from dropping them off. If Curt doesn't stay there, he may try and get to the installation. I see. It will take you twelve more hours to grow eight new control devices. That's unfortunate. We could use them quicker than that. But once we get Curt, we can hold off investigation for that length of time. The President of the United States has great faith in him. And if you can control a hotline call from Curt to the president... We can stall for that length of time. What are my instructions? Remain here and in contact until Jackson is evacuated. It will be done. What's happening? Where are they going? Stay here, Anne. Stay right here. Hey, hey, look! What's happening? What's everybody running from? - Let go of me! - What do you see? Let go of me! Where are ya goin'? I saw a funny-lookin' bird! Anne! Anne! Curt, what is it? Where are you going? Darling, I've gotta go up to the installation. Oh, Curt, no. Anne, look. I've got to find out what's going on. Now, look, you stay inside. And remember to keep all the windows and doors locked. Oh, Curt, I'm afraid something terrible will happen. Please don't go. Curt! Ledford! You're about the only one left, Mr. Ledford. I guess so. Don't be difficult, editor. What's that gun for, Brad? That's not like you. But gun or no gun, here I stay. I helped build this town. My people got your job for you. What's the matter with you, Brad? We don't need papers anymore. They're useless. Get movin'. Sorry. I don't understand a word you're saying. But I'll not go. I'm an old man and here I stay. - Brad! - I've been looking for you, doctor. I just saw you kill a friend in cold blood. Why? Orders, doctor. Orders. Orders? Orders from whom? Zontar, of course. I'll have to place you in protective custody. Why don't you shoot me? You're to be one of us. You're free to go. What've you been doing now? Zontar finally told me about the biostructure of the control devices, the inject-a-pods. They're part of 'em. He detaches them and they fly to the persons wanted like birds. I was trying to spot one. How do they... How do they gain control of the victim? There are no victims, darling. According to Zontar, they carry with them an electrobiological essence of himself, the host. They plant this activated growth in the person's neck... ... after which, he's controlled by the host. It's a little like radio, except that it's biological, too. That is, the person actually becomes a living extension of Zontar. Actually becomes part of Zontar. After the growth is planted, the inject-a-pods die. And the people? They don't die, do they, Keith? - No. - No? Only their minds, their personalities and their identities! Their minds are clearer than they ever thought possible. All the human waste is gone -- the greed, the bitterness. All the foolish nonsense. But these are all emotions! Yes. The emotions are gone. Why are you holding me? Why do you put your arms around me and pull me to you? Why? Because I love you. You know that. I don't know why you should, from what you say. Wouldn't Zontar say love is a waste? It's an emotion, you know! Oh, Keith, you can be so smart, and yet you can be so unthinking! You take away a man's dreams and emotions and all you have left is death. A living death! Emotions are the soul of people! I am not making the rules. It has to be the way it has to be. You don't believe in signs, Dr. Taylor? Oh, General Young. You startled me. Sorry. Didn't mean to. Why is the installation shut down? Where did everybody go? They've all been transported to the district air base. No telling what might happen to them here. Well, Dr. Taylor, may I offer you a ride back into Jackson? Rather a long bike trip. You certainly may, general. Thank you very much. Here, let me put this in the back. What a relief! This is awfully nice of you, general. General Young, how come your jeep is running? It's one of the new experimental models. Oh, Dr. Taylor, I think it would be best if you and Mrs. Taylor would join your employees at the base. Could be. Is there anyway I can get in touch with them? Not a chance. They're under protective custody. General Young, let me move that rock before we get started. What rock? Alright, Keith. I believe ya now. And I also believe you're an accessory to murder! That's a nice way to greet an old friend. Sit down, Curt. You're upset. Yes, I helped Zontar. I told him everything that would make it possible for him to come here. Your satellite was the final link in the chain. Zontar is a member of a race that was born too soon. They developed a culture on Venus that Earth won't catch up to in... ... perhaps a million years. And then disaster struck. You see, Curt. They are host beings. They grow devices that enable them to control other creatures. Somehow the creatures they controlled on Venus became sterile and died out. Without controlled creatures, Zontar's dominant race, slowly withered away. And you mean to tell me that these creatures are gonna control the human race... ... so that it will die out, too? Zontar has an intellect that dwarfs humans'. Makes us look like so many ants by comparison. And you think we need him? We always have. Listen, in the last twelve hours, men have been murdered for failing to obey this new master. Makes ya think a little, doesn't it? Yes. It makes me look back into history for a comparison. Comparison? Why, you can't compare this to anything that's ever happened! Yes, I can! Every great change on Earth has been the result of torment, chaos, and death! Plagues have brought about wondrous cures. Wars have brought about fast planes, atomic power, radiological medicine... Our own discoveries. No, Keith. You're talking about changes that were brought about by man himself. But Zontar isn't human, so your argument just doesn't hold water. Incidentally, revolutions, plagues and wars have also resulted in a number of regressions. What about the Dark Ages? No. No, you're not very convincing. You'll be convinced, Curt. He wants you on his side. And you actually think that I'd condone this reign of terror? That I'll swear allegiance to this Zontar? Well, I won't. I'll fight 'em and I'll fight you, too! You're a traitor, Keith. The most diabolical traitor of all time! I hope you're proud. He was my friend. Despite all our fights and disagreements, he was still my best friend. Is that all you can think of, losing a friend? What about losing yourself? Didn't his words mean anything to you? If you weren't so blind, you'd realize that Curt was your friend today as he's never been before. What do you mean? You fool! If he didn't believe there was still something in you worth trying to save... ... he would've killed you. Killed me? Yes, just as he'll find a way to kill your Zontar! He had a gun. You've just had an undeserved stay of execution! So you agree with him! You've finally turned against me all the way! I've done nothing except what I had to do! You're the one that's got to see that for yourself! Oh, I don't know! I guess I'm just a fool. I'm like Curt. I can't help believing in you. Believing that you'll find yourself. Oh, I love you so. Or the fine man that I married. I can't love a monster! I can't! I won't! Don't cry. Believe me. We know what we're doing. Yes, I hear you. The town is secure. Zontar, I'm troubled. Maybe you don't have that word in your sphere, but I must see you. Yes, I'll be patient. But Curt is still at large. He was here and -- I see. You heard. Then you know he must be controlled. Anne? Anne, where are you? Thank goodness you're home. I've just had a shower. I'll be right out with you. What happened? Well, first, I went downtown. Saw Brad Crenshaw kill Ledford. Then I went over to the lab and found General Young. He was possessed somehow. It's a horrible mess. This whole thing is real, honey. Keith is not crazy. He's frighteningly sane. Anne? How come our shower's working? It's not. But after awhile I felt so sticky, I just had to do something. So I drained the hot water heater, stuck a bucket full of water in the shower window... ... and used the shampoo hose. Guess what I've got. What? A present. See you later, darling. I'm going for a walk. When I get back, you'll feel much better. This has gotta be Keith. Right. I have the only working phone left. Alright, what do ya want? I've just talked to Zontar. He said that you've killed the inject-a-pod that he grew for you. That means you can't be controlled for several hours. Come on over. I want to talk to you. It's terribly important. How'll I get there? Anne's car will run. Alright. I'll come over. But I have to do something first. Good. I'll see you later. Yes, he's coming over here later. Yes, if it must be done, but is it imperative? Can't we wait awhile? What is it? He said Curt's mind must not remain free. It's the most dangerous since he's the one enemy who knows basically what he's fighting. And his inject-a-pod is gone. What does that mean? It means Curt must die. He's too great a menace to live. I must kill him. You came back quickly. I knew it wouldn't take long. You were right. And now we must wait for Zontar to give us our instructions. What instructions? For the next step in the conquest of the world. - And we'll be like this always? - For the rest of our lives. I see, Anne. I see, darling. Hurry up and wait. We come all the way out here and what do we do? Nothin'. We're supposed to be lookin' for suspicious actions, remember? What kind of actions? - You tell me. - I told ya but ya wasn't listenin'! What're ya talkin' about? I told ya I saw a funny-lookin' bird! 'Boyd'? Bird! Will you forget... Will you forget about that bird already? That's all you've been talkin' about all day. Alright, you guys. What do you think this is, a picnic? You men on the right, clean them rifles. Nevermind the beats -- get busy! What are you doing? Closing up shop? Enough murders for one day? Suppose the great Zontar wants you to run down to the corner and tear out a few hearts. What then, master? Suppose the great ruler can't reach you with the wave of his hand. - Or does he have -- ? - That's enough, Martha. Well, it can talk. The little slave-robot can talk. And it's going to have some music. Isn't it just great having the only working tape deck in the world? Or we could dance if there wasn't so much blood around! But I'm sure it makes you feel like a big man, doesn't it? - Martha! - Yes. What I have to do is most difficult and you're not making it any easier. Oh, I wanna make it difficult. I want it to be so difficult you just can't do it! Please, darling. Open your mind for just a few minutes and let me inside, so that I can talk to you! Alright, Martha. I'm listening. Tell me about Zontar. What's he like? Sit down. You know the old hot springs cave up at the ridge? Yes. Zontar's made his headquarters there because the climate is somewhat like that of Venus. Hiding in a cave. Away from the light. He grows control devices in groups of eight. He sends these to four key people and their wives. Wives? Yes, it goes smoother that way. - Now he directs the subjects -- - Anne's been controlled? Yes. There were only three on the list who were not. Curt, and the mayor, and his wife. But the mayor and his wife are dead. They were killed in the evacuation. We know. Then why doesn't Zontar use their devices on Curt? They've already been used. Not on you! No, not on me. Hey! When did it start working? Well, you didn't sleep very long. Wow! How did it happen? What made everything go back on? Don't ask us. It all just started up again. We're checking now to see if everything's in order. Well, what else can happen in one day! - Any coffee? - No. It's all gone. Well, I think I'll make some. Nevermind, Louise. We... We don't want any coffee. Well, I do, if you don't mind. We tried to keep you from looking in there. What's the matter with you? Now, relax, Louise. It will only take a minute. No! No, don't! Are you crazy? Center advises that your best time for your contact with Venus home base will be... Yes. Will Dr. Curt Taylor direct this operation? Very well. We shall remain in contact. Why don't you take a walk? You don't have to be here, and you'll be safe. After everything I said, you're still gonna go through with it? I must have the courage of my convictions. Zontar's as weak as you are! He's hiding in a cave, forcing humans to do his rotten work. He's afraid of strength! And that means Curt Taylor! I'm sorry, Martha. I have to meet Curt. Listen! I don't know if you can hear me or not... But if you can, you listen and listen good. I hate your living guts for what you've done to my husband and my world. I know you for the coward you really are. And I'm gonna kill you. Did you hear that? I'm going to kill you! She's dead. I killed her. You killed your wife? - She was no longer my wife. - She was your wife! You would've been one with her if you hadn't destroyed -- Destroyed the thing that was tryin' to control me? Yes. Why shouldn't I destroy it? And I should destroy you, too. Go ahead and kill me. What good would it do you? Listen, Keith. You're the only one that can help. - You know all about Zontar. - No! He's been playing you for a sucker! He understood and praised my work! He was using your human emotions, your desires to help your race! Your dreams of freedom! He was using these to help him destroy the world! No, no. Look, he has no feelings. He has to have someone do that for him. And that someone is you! I've got to have time to think. You do that. You do that. Hey! I hear a car! - So what? - First car I heard all day. I got better things to worry about, like where are we gonna get rations? I'm hungry, too. How about I go rustle up some cattle? Oh, be serious. Would you believe, chickens? - Supposing you're right -- - I know I'm right! Zontar reasons, concludes and destroys! Have I reached you? I don't know, Curt. For the first time, I'm confused. I don't wanna have to kill you, Keith. I was supposed to kill you. Zontar's orders. Whatever you are, I've come here to kill you. Martha! Martha! Martha, run! So, that's what you look like! Zontar, you're slimy, horrible! Go on, try to control me. Use your intellect on me! You think you're going to destroy the world. I'll see you in hell first! - Keith! - Martha! Oh, Lord. Martha. Now are you gonna help me destroy him? Yes, Curt. Now the men of the installation had been possessed by the inject-a-pods... You take care of them, I'm going to the cave. Here, take my gun. Guns won't hurt him, Curt. But I've got something that will. Something that not even you've seen yet. What's that? How do you think I communicated with Venus in the first place, Curt? By a laser principle that not even the government and all its millions have perfected yet. This beam gun contains a plutonium ruby crystal. It's capable of fantastic bursts of power. It'll be enough to blast 'em apart. It's the only thing on Earth that will. Let's go. Magalar! Magalar, I 'sawr' a monster in a cave! Saw, stupid. Saw. I SAW a monster in a cave. The general didn't say nothin' about no monsters. Now, pack up, men. We're movin' out. You stupid, snap. Well, gee... This is close enough. Good luck, Keith. The jet is on the installation strip. Yes, I've been told. Zontar has ordered me to Washington for a meeting with the President and the cabinet. They suspect nothing. - Do you have the explosives? - A briefcase full of them. They will all die with me. Easy. Hold it. File, Paton, Rowels, drop your packs. Get your bayonets. We're goin' in. Now the rest o' you, stay here. Fall back! Fall back! The ammo don't hurt 'em! I made it possible for you to come here. I made you welcome to Earth. And you're trying to destroy it. Not save it. You wouldn't want to see them. - Dead? - Yeah. Dead. Both of them. He acted like he knew that thing. He did. Keith Richie came to realize with the loss of his own life... ... that man is the greatest creature in the universe. He learned that a measure of perfection can only be slowly attained... ... from within ourselves. He sought a different path. And found death... ... fire... ... disillusionment... ... loss. War, misery and suffering have always been with us. And we shall always strive to overcome them. But the answer is to be found from within. Not from without. It must come from learning. It must come from the very heart of man himself.
