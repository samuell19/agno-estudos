After Anatoly Rybakov's trilogy "Children of Arbat" CHILDREN OF ARBAT PART III Moscow, 1934 So, do they curse me? Some of them. There are some. I was driving on the Arbat. There were ten dalliers standing on the corner wearing foreign duds. Funny. You ask them, what is dearer, the Soviet homeland or abroad. I'm also wearing a foreign suit. It doesn't keep me from loving my country. That is you... You are our legal representative in Europe. You don't concern us. How's Hitler? Hitler means war. The industrial potency of Germany is really high. Arms are not a problem for them. They are a real danger. England and France are against Germany. The real foe is England. I will maintain my opinion. That's why we moved you. Party doesn't need flaunty opinions. Those who do not understand this, are no longer necessary. Whether I am necessary for the Party, is up to the Party. Sorry, I'm busy. Family name. Pankratov. - Get dressed. Hurry up! Quick! To the right. To the left. Sit down. Your full name. - Pankratov, Alexandr Pavlovitsh. Birth time and place. - 1912, Moscow. Why are you here? - You tell me. I am asking questions here. Why were you arrested? - Because of the Institute, I guess. What happened? I told the docent his bookkeeping lectures are botchy. I was also accused of anti-marxism in science. I also wrote epigrams about students in the poster. It was considered as laughing over the best students. They threw me out from the Instutute and Komsomol. The commission of Sholts reinstalled me. So you were arrested for something else? - There is nothing else. You really want to fool us with the disagreement with the docent or the unfortunate poster? We are not here to shoot the sparrows with cannons. You have a funny idea of the organs of Cheka. So why was I arrested? - But we want you to tell us everything. You have a chance to be honest and open to the Party. I'm ready to answer all your questions. - Excellent. With whom did you have the counter-revolutionary discussions? Me? With no one. So we arrest innocent people? So even here you continue your counter-revolutionary agitation? It's a real pity, Pankratov. You're hypocrite. - How dare you call me like that! Sit down, Pankratov! I am going to show you what I dare to do. You betrayed our government. You have been taught, given a scholarship. But you cheat us. You think you came to a spa? We have other options for guys like you. Are you sleeping? Nina Ivanova is on the phone. What does she want? She says it's urgent. Tell her I left. Understood? Hush now, don't shout at your mom. Bye then. Hi. - Hi. Do you have to, Max? Stopi it. Stop it, Max! Hi, uncle Kolya. - Hi, guys. Twirling and turning the ball blue, twirling and turning upon my head. Twirling and turning and wanting to fall, the groom wants to kidnap the bride. Stop it, Max. Aren't you sick of it? Why? We saw a good movie. - Three days ago. And you are still singing. Perhaps I also want to kidnap the bride and slowly accustom her to that. Yes. Too early accustoms. Why early? I'm leaving soon. Exactly. Hi. - Hi. Exactly, that's what you're doing. But I want to stay in Moscow. I want to stay. Here's everything - libraries, seminars, museums. You can visit lectures, develop yourself. I have everything here. You have nothing there. How's that? We've been together for years. We had an understanding? Did you think about that entering the military school? Tell me, did you? I dreamt of it as a kid. I have also dreams. Hi. - Hi. Can I dream? Can I have my own life? Listen to me. What are you dreaming about? Want to be like Tukhachevsky? Or like Voroshilov? It's just that the Red Army has won and there is no war. What is your dream about? You are going to boss the soldiers around. Like this. You are going to tell them: to the left! Forward march! Left, left, left. Giving commands like that. And then back again: left, left, left. Then again: left, left. Forever. What kind of a dream is that? Why are you laughing? He's laughing. Stop it, Max! Hello to the sentimental hippo. Hello to the future Attorney General. Hi, Ninochka. - Hi. Did you hear about Lena? - What about her? Lena... - Lena, Lena. Lena has a hemorrhage. That's all. Is she home? - No, at the hospital. At the Marina Rochas. Here's the phone number and address. What happened? Are you asking me? I have no idea. Perhaps you do? Ok, I'll go see her. Okey. Hi, uncle Vanya. - Hi. Good evening. How is the condition of the patient Lena Ivanovna Budyagina? You're alive... 39,2. Poor Lenka. What shall we do? Oh, Lena, Lena! An act with possible consequence of death of the victim. Mom, what a fool you are! Idiot. We're in a jam. You arrived in time. Not for long. I'm busy at the Congress. Are you going to see Stalin? - Of course. Like I'm seeing you now, I'm more and more convinced at the Congress in the necessity and justness of what's going on. What's going on? What's going on, Sonytchka? There's a Party, Sonya. And there are the Party people. Experienced, trustworthy people who know how to deal with things. I'm convinced they will never allow lawlessness in the country. What about Sasha? What happened to Sasha is not just error. It's a bullshit! If he's innocent, they will let him go. Is he guilty? Are you doubting him? They have to have their reasons. I want you to be ready for anything. I promise not to leave Moscow before I find out. Bring me some tea. I have to leave soon. Alevtina Fyodorovna, I turn to you because of Sasha Pankratov. I've decided to write a letter. All the classmates will sign. All of us will sign. Sasha was our Komsomol secretary. All of us will sign. Lena, Vadim, Max. You do remember our class, Alevtina Fyodorovna? We were like a family. Perhaps Sharok will not sign. Who cares, because all the teachers will. We all loved Sasha like crazy. What do you think? Who gave you the idea? - No one, I decided myself. I will take the signatures because I'm here every day. Have you told this to any of your classmates or teachers? No, I came first to discuss with you. All right. So listen. I have heard nothing. And you didn't tell me anything. You will forget this discussion and stop talking to anybody else. Did you understand? Come in. That's all. Hello. I'm Yuri Sharok. I remember. Lets go. Dyagov. - Yuri Sharok. Graduating from the institute comrade Sharok? Waiting for the appointment? I would like to get to know you. Tell about yourself. My father works at the sewing factory. I'm socially active, a member of Komsomol. Without criminal record, worked as a grinder. One difficulty - my older brother is sentenced for eight years for stealing. Where are your parents from? Both were born in Moscow. Mother is a housewife. Where do you live? - On Arbat, house number 51. Do you have a big apartment? With two rooms. Do you have other relatives? There are no close relatives. There is no contact with the distant ones. What are your plans after the institute? I would like to return to the factory. Well, my task was to find out your plans. The rest is up to the governance. I will call you. Well, Pankratov, did you think about my proposal? I have no idea what you are talking about. - That's too bad. You want to dilly-dally? I have no idea what kind of contra-revolutionary discussions you had in mind. You're no sincere, Pankratov. You want to talk about the Institute, not the main thing. But even here you were dishonest. You hided many things. That is typical of you. What did I hide? So. Go on. Where were we, Pankratov? I was hiding something. - You didn't say you looked for protection from higher circles. From whom?- Ryazanov and Budyagin put in a word for you. I only informed my uncle but did not ask for protection. Was the meeting with Solts also organized by your uncle? Nobody organized anything. I went myself to Solts. People wait for months, but you were received at once. Are you fooling us? A lucky chance? Why did I have no right to turn to the Committee? Why did my uncle have no right to put a word for me? Why am I accused? Why do you keep me here? You are accused of not being sincere. You have hidden other things, too. Like about Krivorutshko. - I've seen him only twice. He put a stamp in my student card. - Without telling you? What about? - He had anti-party talks with other students. And to you, his defender, not a word? Strange. - But it's true. Well, we are patient guys. We have time until you remember what you have to remember. Where are you going? Get a way from the window. Wanna go to the carcer? I need fresh air. Hello, Yura. Nina Ivanova here. Lena was checked out. We are going to visit her with friends. Are you coming? I'm busy today. - I hope you're coming later? I have to stay late. Yura! Bastard! What kind of a person is he? Who? - Doesn't matter. Where are you going? What a stupid question! Where and where? To work. I have an extra job at the evening school. I work like crazy contrary to others. Only you are going to the theatre, movies and skating. We are not the farmers. - You have to have some obligations. You just want to lay down on the sofa. Very much so. - Really? You have to have obligations. Do you have some money left? I took 5 kopecks for skating. Skating? You have to finish your homework. - Just a second. I made some porridge. I kept it warm. You have to eat when you come back. There, you have to mistakes. Thanks. Two mistakes? I'll go to Lena in the evening. Don't wait for me. You have to be back by eleven. Look at me! Look at me! You will not let Zoya in. Repeat! I will not let Zoya in. Good. I'll be late. Zoyka, Ninka cleared off. Come over. Come in, Zoyka! Hi. It's me. Why are you not ready? Why are you wearing white? Because I lost the ribbon from the violet. There is no difference. - But we agreed. I wear white, you violet. - So you will. Violet one. - With white jersey? You will wear violet, I will wear white. Why do we always do everything like you want. Not like I want, but as we agreed. Okey. That's better. - Do as you will. What's this? What is it? I'm not going anywhere. What's wrong? - I'm not going. What are you saying? - I'm not going. I will wear that hat... Var! Varya! Please forgive me. I didn't want to. - You have to forgive me. What are you... - I... I just don't want to go when Sasha is there. Show me. Like a mirror. I'm not going. Why do they torture him? For what? You are so wise. Such a honest face. Perhaps you don't know yet. Mark is going to tell you about Sasha. You will find out. I still can't believe. Hello? Lena. - Jurochka! Finally. Why didn't you come? I called the hospital every day. - Really? Everyone is coming over today. Will you come? I know we cannot talk, but when? I will call. Good. How is she? She's alive. You were lucky this time. Perhaps it's enough now? Stop it, mom! - Hush now. Don't shout at your mother. Can I bring cigarets? - Go on. How can I make an appointment? It's not up to us. - Where should I turn to? Who can help me? - It's not our responsibility. Young man... Go away. Don't you see how many people are waiting? Leave! Where should I turn to? - You are disturbing. Please leave! - All right. Pankratov, Alexandr. - Just a moment. Pankratov is not allowed. Why not? Where to turn to? No idea. Go now. No idea? You arrested him, you have to know. Varya. - No idea! Sofia Aleksandrovna, at least we know now he's here. Now we can write and ask for giving packages and seeing him. Sofia Aleksandrovna, lets go home. Lets go drink some tea. It's cold. No, Varya. Lets stay for a bit. When I'm here, it seems he's somewhere close. It feels empty at home. Why are you standing here, Sofia Aleksandrovna? Lets go. Is the prison dearer than home? Lets go, it's cold. You'll catch cold. Lets go. Even if it's March, it's still cold. I can't leave you here. Are you saying Sasha is the enemy of the Soviet government? Do we have to confirm he's an enemy? Of course we are guilty before him. Because he's in the prison and we are free. The best one amongst us is in prison. And everyone is silent. So what can we say? We don't even know what he's accused of. So do we have to believe now he's guilty of anything? Do we have to give up? Do we have to renounce him? - Nobody is renouncing him. How is that? - Lets go to Sofia Aleksandrovna. And what do we tell her? Sofia Alexandrovna, we are so sorry, but we cannot help. Does she need such a sorry? - What does she need? This is what she needs. A letter. We have to get all the signatures. We need the signatures of the teachers. Sasha was our party secretary. I wrote that we are responsible for him. And where shall we send it? - To the security organs. What if they invite us? What do you know about Pankratov? He was a good komsomol at school. But that was six years ago. How is he now? What happened at the institute? What did he tell you? Then they bring Sasha and ask him what did he tell us. Murashevitsh, you're afraid you will be interrogated. No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. No, I'm not. - Stop it. Lets talk to father. Papa. - Hello, Ivan Grigoryevitsh. Hi. - Hi. We have a question. We want to help Sasha. Yes. - But how? We decided to write a letter to security organs. Where? - Security organs. Nina, who needs this letter? Why? We have to do something. They don't need you. We want the investigation to make the right decision. Ivan Grigoryevitsh. - Give me the letter. Remember, this letter did not exist! Go now. - Ivan Grigoryevitsh... - Go! And remember, this letter did not exist. Did not exist. Papa. How are you feeling? - Good. Good. Go now. Are you hungry? - No. Perhaps tea? I need your advice. What should I do? Friends came to see Lena today. These are good kids. They know she has difficult times. This is not the only reason they came. Nina Ivanova wrote a letter in defense of Sasha Pankratov. So what, Vanya? I tore it to pieces. - That was a right thing. But I have to do something. Don't be a fool, Vanya. It's useless. No, these kids have to carry on the aims of the revolution. And I as a revolutionary bolshevik cannot tell them anything. I can't tell them that arresting him was a right thing because it isn't. And I cannot tell them it was wrong because then I have to explain. Try to understand. Stalin invited Ryazanov to the Central Committee. He has to know about the arrested nephew. The arrested nephew is like Rjazanov's Achilles' heel. This was done on purpose. This will make him serve the master. But if you meddle in this, your relations with Stalin will get even worse. Enough now. Calm down. Enough. Yet I've decided to call Berezin. Where are you calling? - To Berezin. I know him as a brave, honest checkist. Please don't be stupid. Think about our children. That's why I do it. Berezin. - Comrade Berezin. Budyagin here. Hello, Ivan. Glad you called. I would like to talk about Pankratov, Aleksandr Pavlovitsh. I know him as a honest, decent person. I ask you to solve the case. Understood. - Thank you. Take care. Did you hear about Sasha? - I did. Forgive me for calling upon you. I didn't foresee the things would turn out like this. I understand. I have no pretensions. I'll try to talk to Yegoda or Berezin during the session. Listen. They knew he was your nephew. They checked it out. Sasha is not an accident. Can you explain? Are they preparing something for the session? A faction, a spilt in the administration? This cannot succeed. You know that. The Party doesn't support this because Stalin is behind it. I am absolutely sure that arresting Sasha has no deeper meaning. It is completely accidental. You believe in accidents? I believe in healthy mind. What if the mind is not healthy? Pankratov is to be allowed receiving packages and access to the library of the prison. Yes, sir. Name. - Pankratov. Sign here. Take off your dirty clothes. Received everything. I need only bread, meat and clean clothes. I'm fine and in good health. Kisses, Sasha. Hi, women comrades. - Hi. Fluffing? - Yes. - Then go on fluffing! Give me your bag, woman! What are you doing? Vika, Vika! Can't recognize your own? Is it you, Yura? - It's all right. Keep fluffing. God, you scared me! - Did you really not recognize me? You should have become an actor! Stop this! Vika, Vika! How are you? Stop it! Not bad. - Are you ok? Haven't seen anyone after the New Year. Give me your hat! I have thing to do. - What things?' Things. - What things? I have a part in an episode at Mosfilm. - Really? Constant rehearsals for different roles. Look at you! How about you? Were you appointed? - Not yet. Lets go to my place. Lets have a look at my place. No, no. All right, lets go! Lets go. Oh, Yurka! Comrade Berezin. Hello. - Hello. The organs of the Party recommended you to NKVD. I checked your files. Your brother has a criminal record? Yes. Do you know the persons involved in his case? I saw them at the hearing. Are you in contact with your classmates? We don't meet anymore. Kostin, Maxim graduated from military school. He's moving to Far East. Aleksandr Pankratov was arrested. Though I don't know why. Ivanova, Nina is a teacher. We live in the same house. We sometimes say hello in the yard. Murashevitsh, Vadim lives close by on Arbat. We sometimes see each other. He's a philologist. And there's also Lena Budyagina. She lives in the house number 5. We meet rarely. Daughter of Ivan Grigoryevitsh? - Exactly. Good girl. Do you have a fiancée, a girlfriend? I'm not planning to get married yet. Do you visit horseracing with your father? - Not at all. You mentioned Pankratov. Aleksandr Pavlovitsh Pankratov? Yes, we called him Sasha. He was our komsorg. - What kind of a person is he? It was eight years ago. Seemed like a decent guy. Honest komsomol leader. But I have no idea how he's now, All right. We will think about the proposal. You have to understand this is a great honor. Organs of the NKVD is the forefront of the Party. We never force anyone. We don't mind if you say no. After the building complex, I built a cinema, the club Osoaviahim, a pioner camp, kindergarden and health center near the hot springs - "Matsesta of the Urals". Comrade Ryazanov, the country needs metal. I'm getting there but first we need industry. For that we need cultivated workers. Cultural life is the main part of civilized industry. We heard that you are building living houses instead of factory. This is not true. People work only during their free time. Kindergarten is good. Why didn't you let the- investigation commission in? The commission of Petakov thinks the living houses are useless. I'm ready to take responsibility for this in the name of the factory. Sergo. - Yes. Do you remember how the young plant grows through concrete? I do, Goba. This commission is a huge mistake. I visited the factory recently. It's working. It's giving metal. Comrade Ryazanov took a right action. The workers need not only wages. That's what the capitalists do. The workers need spas and kindergartens for their children. They need to watch a good movie at the cinema. That's how we take care of the people. Expand and do your job. How's your nephew? Still in the prison. - Did you say something up there? That would have been tactless. You think so? Stalin put me in the Central Committee. In spite the fact that my nephew is arrested. So what? - Do I have a right to waste the time on a kid who undoubtedly has done something foolish. Sasha is my nephew. They surely know about him. Besides, Sasha is there. Therefore, he must have done something. And that is indisputable. I received everything. I need only bread, meat and clothes. Everything's fine. I'm in good health. With kisses, Sasha. Only bread and meat... Only bread and meat...
