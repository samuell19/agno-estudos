But, as chance would have it, we both want the same thing: Grace, Sofia's mother, town doctor. You need her; so do we. (Josh) Where is she? (Mr. Drake) You heard of a man called the Shepherd? (Josh) Yeah, I've heard of him. Some kind of a prophet. He's a vagrant. His name's George Hilcott. Drifted through town last winter talking crazy. One day he just wandered off. I assumed he was dead, then I started hearing stories of him gathering followers, performing miracles. Grace ran off to join him in the summer. We sent men to find her. Some came back empty-handed and then some didn't come back at all. (Josh) So you think that I can find him when your men couldn't? (Mr. Drake) My men couldn't find hay in a haystack, but you're an experienced rider, and you're motivated. But there's something else. You know who I was before this? Nobody. I worked at the gas station, part-time. Didn't have any desire to be in charge of anything. Then the Day happened. I learned something about myself. I wasn't gonna be a victim for anybody. And I killed a lot of men who thought they could steal from me, bully me. Next thing I knew, half the town was gone, the other half was looking to me for leadership, so I gave it to 'em. See, some of us still want to live the way we used to, not just survive. I don't have the luxury of pondering prophets or miracles, but I ain't blind either. I've seen things I can't explain. This Shepherd, we've found their tracks, camps; it's like chasing ghosts. Some think he's a genuine holy man and that he can only be found by a man of faith. So you think I can find him because I believe? You find the Shepherd, you'll find Grace, and you'll save the girl. Or you can do nothing, and I'll hang you in the morning. It's up to you. You got lucky, rider. Next time I'm gonna break you in half. Well, there ya go, bud, gassed up, oiled up. She is a beauty.

(Sofia) So many people deny the Day, say it didn't happen, it was a solar flare or something. We're not even supposed to talk about it, especially not when those ULC creeps are around. But I'm not stupid; I know what I saw. I was in Denver, downtown at a music festival and there were thousands of people in the street, so they had to block it off. I was on a double date with Brian, my boyfriend, and my mom and her new friend. I forget his name. Then all a sudden this light filled the sky. And at first we thought it was part of the show, but then we knew it was something different. It moved through you, knowing every single part of you. Then there was this sound, like a bomb or an earthquake, and people panicked, they went everywhere. It was crazy. That was the first time I had ever seen someone die, but then I saw them. I saw them, people glowing from within, but they weren't afraid at all. They vanished into a single speck of light and flew away. What about you? Where were you on the Day? Small town. I had some trouble with a biker gang, and I killed a few of them. (Sofia) Does a day go by when people aren't trying to kill you? The next day I found the Lord, a little late. Teach me, please. I'm not the guy you want. Maybe the Shepherd can-- But I'm asking you. I mean, I can tell you what it says in here, but it's up to you to believe. So what does it say? (Josh) Well, Jesus is speaking, here he says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father but through me." Yeah, but I don't understand. I want you to start at the beginning. Can you teach me everything? Alright. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was formless and empty. The thing to remember is that salvation can't be bought or earned like it was some kind of a prize. It's a relationship. It's through faith, through devotion, through his sacrificial blood on the cross that opened the door to heaven for us. But we still have to accept. I resisted for a long time, didn't think that he could love someone like me. Certainly didn't think that he would die for someone who did the things that I did. But I was wrong. He can and he did.

Oh hey, we got movement. [engine revving] Oh no, no, no, no. (Sofia) What? We're leaking fuel. How far is the Shepherd's camp? I don't know, no one knows where it is. Here, that guy put a mark on the map. Josh, that guy was crazy. Just look. It's about 20 miles from here. We're not gonna make it. Well, can you patch it? There's no time. They're coming. [shouting] Ah! (Sofia) You did everything you could, Josh. More than anyone else would've. No, I didn't. You were right, I put limits on myself. (Sofia) Josh, where did you get that? Josh! Josh, there is always a better way. You taught me that, and it's true. Josh, you taught me how to find peace, to not be afraid, not even of dying. Violence, anger, revenge, that'll lead you away from him. You don't want to do this. Josh, because of you I believe. I believe Jesus died for us. I believe he protects us, and he makes a way. You believe that too. Don't lose your faith. What's going on? Why aren't they stopping? It's like they can't even see us. ♪♪♪ Would you like to meet the Shepherd? Yes. Yes, please. Follow me. What about the car? All will be provided for. Don't worry. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [friendly chattering] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Sister Martha. Eat, drink, we have plenty. (Sofia) Mmm, where did you get these? I thought these died out. Hey, nice to meet you, here. (Sofia) What's happening here? I don't know whether to be happy or worried. (mysterious male) Be glad. This is as the Lord wants us to be. So it was once, so shall it be again. Wow, this is incredible. How are these growing so well? (friendly male) You're back. Looks like you found what you were looking for. Welcome. I'm Raoul, I'm the mechanic around here. He got up without saying a word and just wandered onto the prairie. At this point we're used to it. He's the Shepherd. (Raoul) That's what they say, but to us he's Brother George. He's always where he needs to be. I don't know how he knows, but he does. I don't know myself. I just have a feeling of what I'm supposed to do and I do it. This morning I was reading and praying for guidance, how I was going to reach the coast. And I had this sudden urge to walk out onto the highway, and there I found Brother Joshua and Sister Sofia. You know our names. You told me, didn't you? No. Oh, I guess I just know. Brother Raoul, would you please tow Brother Josh's car back to camp. I have a feeling. Huh. (young female) George? George, can you help my plant? I've tried everything. It's dying. Okay, come back later. I'm sorry. I'm sure you have many questions. Yes, my mother, Grace. Is she here? Grace? There's no one here by that name. What? Wha--no. No, no, that's impossible. She looks like me, she's my height. She's in her sixties. She's a doctor. I know all of my people. She's not here. What is this? What do you want? To get paid? She's here. We were told she's her. We need her. A girl's life is at stake. I'm sorry. Someone told you she was here? Who was it? Was this person trustworthy? I don't believe it. I don't understand. Why would he lie about this? If she's not here, then where is she? J--Josh! Josh, look, look! What? That's impossible. How did-- how did you do that? How did you do that? I really don't know. I pray for sick things to heal and they do. I pray for small things to grow and they do. I pray for evil to stay away and it does. Can you do that for a person? Yes. (Josh) There's a girl who's dying in town. Can you help us? (The Shepherd) I figured there was a reason God brought us together. You need something from me, and I need something from you. What do you need? (The Shepherd) Forgive me. Forgive me, I should explain. I was in a coma. The result of a life of bad choices: drugs, crime, prison. I was not a nice man. I was not supposed to wake up, but I did on the Day. I heard a voice and I saw a light, a light that's still there on the edge of my sight, a choir that's always on the edge of my hearing, a warmth... that I can almost feel when I reach out my hand. Since I woke up, the memories of my life are slipping away, being replaced by wonderful visions from the Lord. People, places, journeys through far-away lands from different times. I saw the deserts of Egypt like I was there. I saw the first temple of Jerusalem. It was like I was sitting at the table with Jesus and his disciples. I remember their faces. I know languages I've never learned. I need you to help me follow his call, Josh. I've stayed here helping people best I can, waiting for what comes next. And last week the call came again, the urge. I have to go back to the Holy Land. There's another one out there just like me somewhere, and together we will meet in Jerusalem and we must bear witness to what happens there. (Josh) You want me to take you to the Middle East? No, just to the coast. God will provide me safe passage from there. But you'll stop in town first to-- I doubt if it's going to be that easy, but I will go. What time is it? (Raoul) Almost sundown. That can't be right. How long were we in there? Time moves a bit strange around Brother George. You get used to it. She's got a leak. (Raoul) Not anymore. She's all patched up. She's a beauty. You mind if I take a look under the hood? Sure, go ahead. If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it. (Josh) Yeah, me too. Does it say anything about this in the Scriptures? It talks about two witnesses in the book of Revelation, but it doesn't really specify as to who they are, just that they're prophets with the power of God. It says, "They are 'two olive trees' and two lampstands, and 'they stand before the Lord of the earth.'" Lord of the earth? Satan, devil. They're supposed to preach to the people, the world, and their words will be like fire and they'll kill anyone who tries to harm them. And then the Beast will rise up and destroy them. Man, I thought I had problems. (Josh) You okay? [muffled crying] I'm sorry about your mother. I just don't know if she's alive or dead. (Josh) Your people, they're leaving. (Raoul) We knew this day would come. Don't worry, they'll be safe. I found this on the inside of your fender. What's it for? - Oh no. - What is it? He never wanted us to bring back your mother. What do you mean? (sheriff) We're here. The Shepherd. Where is he? I'm here. There's no need for violence. - What? - I surrender. No, you can't. Is it him? (The Shepherd) It's alright, Brother Joshua, it's alright. It's him. Get him in the truck. He's not going anywhere with you! Oh, will you please shut up? [gunshots] (The Shepherd) Brother Joshua, have faith in God's plan. [heartbeat] Have faith in God's plan. Have faith, faith in God's plan. Search the building. Kill anything that moves, starting with him. [gunshot] Call the ULC. Tell them that I have what they want. (sheriff's partner) Nobody home, the place is clear. (sheriff) Let's go. Bring the car. We're moving out! [heartbeat] Where is she? Where's my mother? Abner, hey! (Mr. Drake) They're on their way. No one sleeps tonight. Nobody comes in or out of here for any reason. Don't take your eyes off him. Nothing's gonna happen. Don't do this, please. I've seen what he can do, Abner, it's the real thing. It's not a trick. You have to let him go, please. I remember a girl who crawled to my doorstep, willing to do anything for a roof over her head, a hot meal. And I took you in, you and your mother. And this is the thanks I get. Where is she? Is she still alive? Will things go back to normal? Will you do as you're told? The ULC needed surgeons after the war. I sent her to them. She's still alive as far as I know. I'm sorry I lied to you. It was necessary. (ethereal male voice) Joshua? Joshua. I'm with you, Joshua. How? How is-- Who are you? You know me, Joshua. It's you, Lord. That's not possible. You wouldn't-- It says that-- Peace. I've not returned yet, that time is still coming. You can help me. You can do anything. I can, but in the right time and for the right reason. The Shepherd, he touched me, he prayed for me. Can he really heal? Only God can heal, Joshua. The witness is an instrument. By God's hand, through him, that which seems impossible can become possible, but the choice is yours. I have a choice? There's always a choice. Does that mean that I could-- I could see them again? Rachel and-- And your daughter and your parents. They're waiting for you. All you have to do is take my hand. But they need me here. If I don't help them, how will they-- the Shepherd, he's part of the prophecy-- Son, have no fear, the prophecies will be fulfilled, be it one way or another. One river is calm while the other is treacherous. In one boat many will be saved; in the other many will be lost. Maybe I--maybe I don't want the responsibility. I'm tired of fighting. It's never enough, for every 1 that I save, 100 are-- It matters a great deal to that one person. It matters to me. Tell me, Lord. What do I do? [gasping] ♪♪♪ Someone's coming.
