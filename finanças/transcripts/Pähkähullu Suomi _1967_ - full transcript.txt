CRAZY FINLAND Dear viewers! This is Finland. It has just turned 50. Happy birthday to you! Just now we see a stretch of Farmer Hulkkonen's woodlands... Oh, I got a speck of dirt in my eye. And here we have Helsinki, Finland's capital. Daughter of the Baltic. Here we see Farmer Hulkkonen's daughter, and here is Farmer Hulkkonen's son. But more on him in the film that follows. This is a rose, Rosaceae vitae. And the lily of the valley, our national flower - Vionis finlandiae. Finland has over 60,000 lakes. Here is one of them, Lake Tarva, Tarvajärvi. Did you call me? - Forget it. Go on diving. - OK, thanks. We've seen things that come in pairs... Such as these. But as I said, this is Helsinki. Let's find among the pedestrian throng a typical taxpayer. Such as this one... No, not quite as typical as that. But... that one! Excuse me, sir, wait a moment! Jump into the air! Thank you. Just stay there! The matter will be decided shortly. An American Finn arrived in our country today, the millionaire, William Njurmi. He is the son of a Finn who emigrated to the US in 1920, by the name of Vilho Nurminen. The family is important in American industry. Its wealth is based on oil discoveries, specifically hair oils. The family motto is: "Use Njurmi's hair oil and your hair will grow like grass." Njurmi is accompanied by his secretary, Miss Smith, and bodyguard Luigi Cravatto. At the airport Mr Njurmi presented a gift to be given to the president. His stay here is being filmed, and the film is intended to be a commercial about Finland for use abroad. Details about the film in our press overview. CRAZY FINLAND claims Spede Pasanen Film Productions Spede Pasanen, Simo Salminen and Esko Salminen agree together with... and...

Hello! That was it. So it was. It was a shambles. Totally! That can never be shown abroad to promote Finland! Yes, but that William Njurmi screwed everything up. Why didn't you give him instructions? Well, we were ordered to film in secret everything he did. And that's what's there. We'll fix it. We'll find... ...an ordinary guy off the street. A typical taxpayer who has strong opinions. Gentlemen, he's been found, He's waiting for you outside. There you are. - Yes. - Indeed... We've made a 50th year anniversary film about Finland that will be shown widely abroad and in Finland. Well, well! I heard about it on the news. So what? - Well, it turned out to be crazy. - What do you mean? Things are shown exactly as they are in Finland. - Then it's bound to be terrible. - Well, it needs a bit of retouching. We started filming as soon as he arrived from America. A flower from the Ministry of Finance. You have a full schedule, Mr Njurmi. Please get in the car. On the journey from the airfield a beautiful Finnish landscape opened before the visitor's eyes. First of all, the visitor is asked what he thinks of Finland. To everyone's surprise, he replied in fluent Finnish... "Very nice." We are very moved that you have come to acquaint yourself with the barren, poverty-stricken land of your father's birth. Of not the least importance is that you have promised funding to support the unemployed. We are most appreciative of the fact that you are investigating the possibilities of investing here in Finland. In other words... your great wealth will, for its part, help Finland's commerce to develop. Right... absolutely! I'm also mooed, I mean moved... when I think how much dough you've got that we don't have. And I believe, Mr Njurmi, that our government and your money will work very well together. And now to the sauna! Water! This is wonderful! Here is our greatest achievement in architecture: Tapiola, the Garden City. And the pride of the citizens of Tapiola... The water tower. The Tapiola Aquatic Centre. The Tapiola fountain. The Tapiola traffic roundabout. And a happy Tapiola family in their very own house. And now to the Tapiola sauna! - Here you are! - Thanks. I hereby christen the flagship of Finland's fleet "William Njurmi II" To the sauna, gentlemen! Mr Njurmi sets the foundation stone for the Aleksis Writers' Institute And now to the sauna! Now Mr Njurmi dedicates the old Lauttasaari bridge. And now to the sauna! Sibelius Park. Paavo Nurmi's statue. Finnish perseverance. Satan be damned! Stay away from my neighbourhood, goddammit! It must be Satan, damn it! Goddammit, that's it, damn it! Then to a floating summer tunnel sauna! Parliament House. The National Museum. The Mannerheim statue. All off to the sauna! The President's castle. The Children's Castle. The grownups' castle. Väinö Linna. And now to the night sauna! Powerful stuff, guys! They were surely the top things to see. But, hey, the national match march and the Winter War should be included. It was, you know, full on at the Battle of Kollaa. I was there, and tanks were coming straight towards me... I agree it was on the level up to now, but... I know, they started to drink after the sauna. Well, no, but... Strip poker, eh? What did he mean? Maybe a sauna bum-burn. Absolutely, gentlemen, but the matter must be kept secret. If Mr Njurmi is declared insufficient, then he can't loan money to the state. Then our economy will go back down the drain. Or to the devil. Excuse me. I raised my gun and fired. I never saw the other one. I got them both with one shot. Wait, I'll tell you... Both with one shot, but bugger it, the council ranger was around. Hear that? It's an elk! Fire! We'll surround it! - There it goes! - To the left. Form an arc from left to right! And Rannanjärvi... they found between themselves. There are three of them! They're coming... Hide! Scram! People! The Thunder Bar The usual, thanks. Just the usual. - Cheers, boys! - Cheers! Thank you! COW "In the forest, the great big..." "Lass of mine, oh lass of mine..." Hey, there it goes! Damn, a pine cone in the guts! That was spot-on. It was like that at Kollaa. - Of course, it was realistic. - That's not enough... There has to be some romance in the Finnish forests, so that the Finnish forests will be swarming with foreigners. At Kollaa, the forests were swarming with foreigners, too. So when the anti-tank men prevailed, the hotels were emptied. No, no, no. Our forests must be a place of romance. Could I have the check, please? In our country, we don't usually bother about such trivial things. Aha, visitors! Lunch for one - Lunch for two - I hope I'm not intruding... - What? If I may introduce myself, my name is William Njurmi. I wonder if you could give me something to eat and wear. You would be amply rewarded for it. You see, I'm an American hair-oil millionaire. Yeah right! What else but an oil millionaire? Down on his luck right now, during a business slump! Good joke! That's enough! Listen, you're a good chap... I've used that ruse myself. But I haven't gone so far as to be an oil millionaire. I usually make out I'm an agronomist. You can score a meal with that, too. We'll set the table with trick number 5! Woman at the wheel! Hey, you bums! Come here! Listen, Miss, I'm not a bum... I'm an agronomist. Yeah? I'm Kielo Joki, journalist. I'll kiss to that! What happened to him? It looks bad! Oh! What'll we do? We'll have to take him somewhere. Step on it! This is a scandal. - Mr Chairman, this is a scandal! - What are we to do? - May I speak, Mr Chairman? - Please do. Firstly, it is quite obvious that this is a scandal. Secondly, Mr Chairman, what are we going to do now? Our unanimous decision is that Mr Njurmi has disappeared. - May I speak, Mr Chairman? - Please do. I move that he should be found. Excellent idea! Stop! He's come round. Glad it wasn't worse. Thanks for the help, Miss. Anything we can do for you? Some rich American has disappeared in these parts. - Have you seen him? - We sure have. - Where? - We saw him here. Yes, just here. - This is where we saw him. - Yes, right here! He came out of that thicket, looking like... Then he started carrying on like... Then he started jumping up and down like an ape. Then he came begging for nuts. "Nuts, please, nuts!" Can that be possible? Yes, I heard that Mr Njurmi could be described as being a bit muddle-headed. - Mr Chairman... - Yes? I move that this is a scandal. I move that the resolution be passed. As a result of the delicate nature of the affair, I move that it be a secret ballot. Supported? I move for a secret ballot to decide as to whether we have a secret ballot or an open vote, or vote for a secret ballot. - Opposed! - Support! Oppose what? I oppose supporting a secret ballot. I support opposing a secret ballot. The matter is settled with a secret ballot. Fancy a cheese pasty? Got to think about it. Well, well! I was just wondering if you needed any work done round the farm? So what can you do? I've done all sorts of work. Farm jobs, wood-cutting. Can you work with machinery? Yeah... threshing. I do threshing and binding. Where are we up to? Are there any farm jobs? The votes have been counted. We have resolved to send a private eye to find William Njurmi and bring him back, without attracting any attention, to civilisation. Miss Smith, as Mr Nurmi's secretary, what is your opinion of our decision? Well...I think it's wonderful. As his bodyguard, what do you think, Mr Cravatto? Cavello, Cavello, find him right away, presto! So I can protect his... - Life. - Si si, life! Besides, last the month's salary is still unpaid, pronto. And you, private eye... Did you understand your task? Yes. Hello... Mr Njurmi? Just a moment, I'll get him. That's simply unaesthetic. Manure in a high-class film! It must be cleaned up. And now boys, some traditional Finnish dancing. That won't do. The government and I prefer folk dances. No, the tango is what's in, now. No, it should be swinging. That's what they like abroad. I demand folk dancing! The tango is tops! Go-go! Folk dancing! Tango! Go-go! Folk dancing! - Tango! - Go-go! - Folk dancing! - Tango! - Go-go! Erm... If you like, Miss, maybe we could pay a visit to that hay barn? On the contrary! There are a lot of things people don't know about, but in there, I could show you some. Lovely! If we take an example, the origin of life... Mother nature has taken care of everything. Instincts are in control of both humans and animals. They sure do! Let's take this blade of straw. Nature has made the bee a propagator of life... Maybe I could make myself more comfortable... and tell you how the pollen flies from flower to flower. Please do! Maybe I can give you a practical demonstration. So it flies from flower A to flower B, and stays to suck nectar. Is that all? By no means, listen. The pollen the bee brought with it pollinates flower B. Are you going to marry me? Of course! Then the bee flies from flower B to flower C. Congratulations, you two. Now we'll have a wedding. - Whose? - Yours. We heard everything, and guessed the rest. In this barn six sisters got married the same way. Let's go without a fight! Hey! What's that up there? Shan't we start the ceremony? Damn near got myself married, there! You rescued me from that woman's clutches. Thank you! I'm ever so grateful! Make three wishes! I'm so rich, you see... I can fulfill your every desire. Go on, make three wishes! Go jump in the lake! What's your second wish? I'll dive in and tell you. Good as done! I've not seen a guy like that. And if you're a detective, so find out about my hen. A hen has disappeared. I could understand you wanting to eat chicken. But a '57 wine was a bit over the top. "Over the top" was having to steal the chicken myself. Yes, but I found you a poultry farm. We do it like we agreed. What's up? Do you speak English? No... not one bit. I'll interpret. He's a rich Yankee tourist. He wants a top class hotel near here. I understand... That way. 2 kilometres, understand? Well, I'll be damned! A Yankee! Never saw one before. Did he understand? 2 kilometres. I'll translate. Thanks! He understood alright. I was in Sweden in '52, and they understood as well. Jump in! - I'm going to the same hotel. - Thanks. I'll be damned! A Yankee! Tough guys, they are. What the hell's wrong now? And I'm in a hurry. Meeting starts in half an hour. Listen... If you can get it started, bring it to the hotel. I'll have to run, to be on time. If you can't start it, leave it here. I'll pick it up after a week. - Bye! - OK, thanks. - I stuck a potato in the exhaust pipe. - Damn clever! Now that we have a car, how can we get some money? That's easy in Finland. We play at being foreigners and the money just comes. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present something magnificent for you... Direct from France, the well known singer... Monsieur Pierre Dumas. Welcome! Merci, madame... Un trop peu, madame... Merci, madame Un peu toujours l'amour madame... Merci. Adieu. Excuse me, where is Olav's Castle? We usually keep it here. It's haunted here. Oh, damn! Kuopio town hall. Fish bread, a local delicacy. The town square is a lively place in Kuopio. Brother statue...and sisters. Puijo's rotating tower. Nice tower, but it turns slowly. Shall we take another turn? Yes, but a bit faster. Miss, step on the gas! Better Lahti's victory... ...than Imatra's transition. As I mentioned in my previous address, this is Turku. Historic landmarks, you see. The Crusaders came from this city... They came along like this... Came to Finland... so... The crusaders here... This here is Lievestuore. Tampere is known for its beautiful girls. Do we get to Kajaani soon? Soon. Should we see Kajaani soon? We just drove through it. Drive slower so we've got time to see something! That's Haparanda. On the Swedish side. So it really does look like that. Same as in pictures. Keep moving. This is Rovaniemi... "Paris of the North." Guardian of the Arctic Circle, Gateway to Lapland. Is that mountain big? Compare it to a matchbox! - My! It's big. - And high. The madness of Lapland can strike at any time. Lapland is known for its riches. Gold is still panned there. But each in his own way... Excuse me, you're wanted on the phone. Well, those guys have covered the whole of Finland. That was some heavy scenery, but then, so was Kollaa. Once, when the enemy was attacking, I shouted to the men... Keep your eyes open, chaps! Rahikainen, keep your head down... That's the way! Boys, boys, put your cards away now. Rokka. Pick up your gun and start shooting. Riitaoja, did you remember to wear 2 pairs of socks? That cold is really biting. Riitaoja's done the same since his last leave. Things balance out! Things balance out! Now we attack. Come on, hurry up... let's go! Lahtinen, don't get too far ahead! Let others attack as well. This is not your very own private war, Lahtinen. Well! Let's see more action! Honkajoki...shame on you! If you don't want to do it, Sinisalo, we'll go by the counter. Atta boy, Private Keinonen! You'll go a long way, I'll tell you that! What is this that dropped in? Not one of ours. Best I throw it back. That's the way... Went off really well. Lahtinen...! Don't attack so far ahead! We aren't a scouting patrol. See now? Honkajoki... Get out of the way! Give Riitaoja room to shoot. Hey, stop spending all your time writing! Put your pencil down, and start shooting! Hey, Linna! Are you deaf? Hey, guys! This what we should get... As hard as steel... Kollaa! Hello? Hello? What? Paavo Nurmi? No! This is William Njurmi. Njurmi, yes. What is it? Yes, yes, of course. Wouldn't do that! That can happen. It often does. Quite correct! Yes. No need to apologise. Wrong numbers are quite common. Statistics show that one in ten calls are wrong numbers. Absolutely correct, of course. I was coming to Helsinki anyway. Besides, I was wanted on the phone, so this went well. Yes, of course. What? Damnation! Please believe me... It doesn't matter at all! Not one bit! It really doesn't matter! Goddammit... Don't apologise for apologising! There's nothing wrong with your finger, it's just... gone into the wrong hole. Understand? What? I'm not the one getting irritated! I just apologise that you called the wrong number! What's your name? I'll come and discuss this. Satu Östring. Thank you! Satu, Satu? Hello, hello? She hung up. Mr Njurmi! Yes, what is it? Yes. Once, in our country's financial circles... in the year eighteen hundred and forty six... there developed a need to legally control the conditions for economic development. and then, in eighteen hundred and forty seven... the need swelled up for capital for our industry. It was soon realized that all available means... They sure are a boring bunch. But here it was noticed... Damned hot in here. I never would've believed you were a millionaire. ...could be in temporary payment difficulties... ...eventually ending up in foreign... The board members are fixtures. Could sure do with some changes. Aha! That was your third wish! We definitely need a change! The gentlemen do what they're told, or there's no loan money to be had! Are you a bit too warm? Let's fix that first... with a bit of ventilation! This is fine. Wait while I get the other one. In the year 1891... "Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall..." Now we're on the right track! Cheers! Firstly, gentlemen, glasses down! Then? And then off to the sauna! But in those branches of industry that I previously referred to... there happened, or you could assume there did, a noticeable improvement... Really... really! It fell apart. As a sensible sort of man, can you help us? No, besides I'm in a hurry to buy some milk. Ciao! Now we're going good! I will say, though, that I like films like this. We're rid of them now. Do you know why I've come here to Finland? You're going to lend the government money to strengthen the economy. That's neither here nor there! I can throw billions here any old time. But there's a more important purpose. What's that? I can't tell you yet, but do you promise to help me? I've nothing else to do right now. - Let's go! - What? Let's go! - What does that mean? - Come with me! I'll come, but tell me what "let's go" means? PRIME MINISTER Get out! Well that's that! As we expected. I think that puts the lid on acting. You weren't any good either. With your talents, you might just make the City Theater. Damned moustache is stuck fast. Okay, let's go! Bella, Bella, mia cara. How about we swap jobs? I should become a secretary. I'm getting fed up with this job. Mamma Mia, mafia, hard job, small pay. Listen, Luigi Cravatto! You haven't done any work since Mr Njurmi toured around the country. You've just lazed around, collecting your high salary. Si, si, but what about Chicago? Sempre tirare... always shooting! Six times, goddammit! I look a bit like Mr Njurmi... So they only shot at me, helvetto campari! I look more like Njurmi than he does himself. Identificato. Hello! Yes? Right. I understand With full authority. I understand. Right... Over. Well, Luigi, from now on, you'll be playing the part of millionaire William Njurmi, with full authority. Come? Yes, for some reason Mr Njurmi wants to lie low, and now we have to try to make people believe that you're the millionaire William Njurmi. With full authority! Mamma mia! Subito! Money, money at last! Man, can I use it! Gravello, secretary! First you'll arrange a press reception for me. And then a meeting with... well, Miss Finland. The swimming pool's to be filled with champagne! And after that... cancel my meeting with the prime minister. Goddammit! Mr Njurmi, why have you kept your identity a secret for so long? Cavallo, Cavallo... We rich have our whims. Who's this lady you're with? Miss Finland, from the year 1922. Delia Liimatainen. Mamma mia! - Where's your bodyguard now? - It's not worth having one. Dangerous work supplement, funeral plan... widow's insurance. I tried to protect my bodyguard's life. We swapped roles. I've been shot 6 times, goddammit! They all shoot! Al Capone. Nitti. Nessi. Titty. Luchi Moreno. Linnosvuo, mamma mia. A photographer! Stupidos, fotografio! OIL MILLIONAIRE'S HIDE-AND-SEEK That blockhead! I should have guessed. It's going to take a lot to clear this up. Miss... a mineral water. Miss! Is it possible to get two hooker-crooker-cocktails? Hooker-crooker... What are the ingredients? Half hooker, half crooker. And when there are two cocktails, you have one whole crooker and one whole hooker. It's imported from England. Does it come with an olive? Absolutely not! In that case, we don't have it. It's imported from England. Quick, after them! Luigi, Luigi Cravatto... Wake up, wake up, up, up, up! You're the most beautiful man in the world Luigi, Luigi Cravatto Wake up, wake up, Luigi. - Good morning! - Bon giorno, bon giorno. Good morning, Mr. Cravatto! Mr Cravatto, you have a full schedule today. I sure do. 9.30 am reception at the city council. Scrap that! The new match factory's first matchbox opening? Scrap that! Welcoming the fleet at Riihimäki? Scrap it! Lunch at 2pm? Si, si...that'll be good. The Njurmi family foundation meeting. No! Never! Underwear Fashion Model School opening? Si, si, bravo! Bravissimo! Bravisississimo! Bravo tissimissio! Of course that'd be great. Si! Trade delegation briefing session? No, scrap it! Dinner with Miss Finland? Si, si! A bit younger than the last one, eh? You've always demanded an old vintage. Don't mix up wine and women! I'll do that myself! Why did I depend on Yrjänä when Tom is here? We have to jump! Bella, bellissima e cantarelli Dolce Al Capone Machiavelli Bella, bellissima e cantarelli Dolce Al Capone Machi-i-i-avelli! Come down, my darling! Bella bella, subito, subito! Bella! Mia cara! Andante adagio allegro, per favore! What can I give you? What could I give you, oh mistress of my heart? Mia cara bella! Soldid, Soldid, troppo soul! I've made a list. Oh? Bella, mia cara... A little walk in the atmospheric woods? Not with these shoes... the twigs would scratch them. Twigs scratch. Pronto, I fix it! No more scratching! Santa la via quo vadis! Summer! Sacramento! So what if it's summer? When I say I want to see famous Finnish winter sports, that's what I'll see! Now! I'm ready! Welcome to the world-famous Njurmi skiing events. The competitors are Finland's elite. Conditions will vary during the races. The temperature is +22 degrees Celsius. The strong temperature changes cause upheaval, but the slide is generally good on the moors. The competitors start their second round... Thousands of onlookers cheer them on. Sometimes the course is very hilly. Sometimes even and steep slopes. The Central Station clock struck 3 times, and he left. Melasniemi first, Alexander second. A quick slurp of blueberry spills on the ground. The track is judged difficult, because Nousiainen got lost, or will he find his way out? We'll see how this plays out, but it looks like the winner is nearly home. A nice smooth run. At that crucial moment, Nousiainen asks for directions. The Orient Express comes in as winner and continues to the rail-freight arrival depot. Honored Mr Njurmi... Due to long-standing and serious difficulties our country's economy has been in a state, where only a large amount of long-term credit can save it. With reference to our previous conversations... the state turns to you in this regard, with confidence. We appeal to those feelings, preserved in your heart, to the poverty-stricken land of your forefathers. In other words, we ask you for money. Cravello, Cravello! I'll give you boys a couple of billion... prego! Write the numerals yourself! There are ten different ones. Simo! What? Where are you holidaying? With my family in Keuruu... Then Kouvola for a beer. And you? I take holidays in winter. I can manage alright in summer. But your senses are sharpened in a cold dark winter. Life needs to be varied. - Come to our weekender in summer. - Sounds good. FIRE Seprento! And now, Mr Njurmi, the formula for the hair oil! Is the fishing good? Last summer I got a 2.5-kilo pike. I'm on my way! What a girl, what a girl! Can we do something together? Yes, get married! Yes, indeed! Hey, what actually happened here? No idea. But it was exciting, eh? He can't wait to find a priest! - Luigi! - Ciao! My wife... arrivederci! Damnation! He's run off! I haven't understood anything for 15 minutes. If you understood, please tell me! You didn't understand? I'll explain. First they came to Finland. Everyone wondered why he had come. But he was at home here. Then they started giving flowers and he had a woman with him. The whole gang was there to meet him. Then they were to show him Finland. They took him to the sauna, since it's so healthy. The sauna opens the pores of the skin and the sweat comes out. Then they took him out to eat. And he did eat a lot! Then it's the sauna again, and a swim. He was so popular that everyone came to look at him. They waved to each other, and went to the sauna. He didn't find a lake, but splashed around in the snow. Having had enough of that, he set off round the country. He went round... Round and round, and round again. Then the short one said: "Romance is the best", and the other one said that there should be a national match. So he switched and got a job on a farm and sowed so awesomely, that the seeds just flew. There was a girl who took a fancy to him. She was serious about him, and began to give him that look, and they were to get married. But then the zealots came and took the firewood. And the women took firewood and everyone took firewood. And the others held a meeting and voted on everything possible, and they were terribly important, but one of them left with his friend to see the sights. One wanted to be in the Winter War. It was like an East-West match. Both sides had casualties, but then came the arbitrator and canceled the match. One foreigner wanted to meet all the girls and arranged ski races, while others fought on the boat. They figured they might finish at the Stadium, where they had more people, and they were chased out. Others ran away and hit each other with their fists. The skinny ones ran away again and so they punched and ran and punched so that the smaller ones fell down. Ah, now I understand! Come on, let's go. Where? To the priest, of course. That's where everyone else has gone. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
