- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Connors! Come on, come on! Hush! Keep there, keep looking, keep looking. What the... Connors! Come on, let's go. - What about him? - Come on, let's go! "The two men made their escape from a working party... ...that was returning to the prison. They are William Connors, an American who was serving a sentence... ...of 12 years for armed robbery, and Lars Svenson, a Swede, who was sentenced to 8 years for his part in the Plymouth bank raid, the raid in which a bystander was killed." Come on... come on. There's... there's a car coming. Come on, he may give us a lift. "There is likely to be mist and drizzle during the day, but this will clear later. That is the end..." Sorry... sorry to trouble you. Our motorcycle packed up and my friend here twisted his ankle. Would you give us a lift? Where's the motorbyke? Oh, it's in the field, we'll come back for it later. - I see, climb in. - Oh, thanks, thanks very much. In the back. Thanks, sir, thank you very much. The nearest garage is three miles down the road, you're lucky I passed right by. Oh, thanks, thanks very much. Tell me, how far are you going yourself? About twenty miles, I live near Bridley. Well, if you don't mind, we'd like to go along with you, it's Bridley we have to get to, we're late already. - What about the motorbyke? - Oh, we'll come back for that. Right now we've got no time to spare. - Okay. - Thanks. Yeah, it's a nice car. It's a little different than riding a motorcycle this time of the year. Yeah, you turn the radio on when you want to, uh? Yes, it's a funny thing about a radio, you go out of your way to get one and half the time you don't use it. All the way from London and I haven't switched it on. Oh... no kidding, huh? - Have a cigarette? - Oh, thanks... thanks very much. By the way, I'm Martin, Jeff Martin. Um, Peters, Henry Peters. My friend in the back is Bob Walters. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Peters, and you, Mr. Walters. Hello. You know, I like it when I get company on the road, especially on a long trip Yeah, yeah, I suppose you do. You said you had business in Bridley? Yeah, yeah... timber business. We got to meet a merchant there. Funny, I know Bridley pretty well, it's just a small place. But I don't know of any timber merchant. You're right, there isn't, not a real one. This fellow's got a greengrocer, timber's a sideline. Then you must mean Tom Jones, he's the only greengrocer there. Yeah, Josie, sure. How's your ankle? It hurts just a little. But it will be okay. But you're so quiet, your friend and me doing all the talking. I'm very comfortable here, thank you. You're not English, are you? - Well, I... - Now let me guess. Accents and where people come from is a sort of hobby of mine. I know, Germany. Yes, that's it, I'd recognize that German tone anywhere. Right the first time, huh? - No need to ask you where you come from. - Yeah, well... But if you're German, why Bob Walters? That was the name you said, wasn't it? His mother was German, his father was English. - Oh. - That's all. Hello! What's this? Looks like trouble. I'll see what it is. You stay here. Good evening, Sergeant. Hello, Mr. Martin, what are you doing here, sir? Just driving some friends back from London. - Where are you going? - I'm going to look around. - Oh no, you don't. - Get off me! - You stay right here! - Get off me! You and that... you and that foot. Hey... he's coming back alone. So far, so good, huh? Well, that's that. Let's go. Uh... what, um... what was that all about? They're looking for a couple of escaped convicts. They're stopping everyone on the road. The sergeant wanted to know who you were. But it's all right. He believed me when I told him you were friends of mine. Good night, sir. All right, come on. Come on, come on. - Tell us why you did it? - Did what? - Covered for us. - Yeah, yeah... You know who we are, you know those police were looking for us. Come on, come on! Suppose I choose my own time for telling you. No, no, let's hear it now. - Look, if you don't tell us... - Exactly what will you do? You knew all along. Even when you picked us up. - That's right. - What's the... what... What's the... what's the gag? What do you want with us? You can do with my help, I can do with yours. So I'm going to make you a proposition. One that will help you escape and earn you a thousand pounds. A thou... a thousand pounds? What, what for? You'll find out. In the meantime, let's continue our trip. - Sure, where are we going? - Home, gentlemen. Where you can be my guests. Along the way I'll explain to you exactly what I want you to do. Jeff should be back any minute. Are you sure you won't stay and have supper, Jimmy? I'd love to but I have several more calls to make, including one to Mrs. Dawson, that's five miles from here. Oh, no, not her again. What's the trouble this time? Acute indigestion, but you never can tell. Her last case of indigestion weighed seven and a quarter pounds. They called it Thomas. - Besides, there's Jeff. - What about him? Are you sure he won't mind me being here when he's not in? Oh, what ever gives you that idea? - Oh, a feeling I sometimes have. - Why should he? He knows you and I have known each other and been friends since way back. Friends? I once took you dancing. Then you were young and foolish. After that you went to medical school... ...and that was the end of that. Hm... Well, I see he has started working again. Probably a concert in April. If everything goes according to plan, that's all he'll need to complete his happiness. - Yours too? - Of course! - Oh, you're not going! - Yes, I must push along. Thanks for the drink and say hello to Jeff for me. I will. There you are. Come again soon, Jimmy. What do you think? Bye-bye. Bye. Raina! Raina! - Yes, Mrs. Martin? - Must you have it on so loud? I didn't understand you, Mrs. Martin. I said the record-player, must you have it on so loud? I didn't realize. Only my husband will be home soon. You know how it annoys him. I won't annoy him any longer, I'm leaving tomorrow morning. Jeff, I'm so glad... Wha... - Hey, you! Over there! - Over there! - Jeff! What is this? - Who's this, your wife? My wife. Hey, Sven, come over here. Take a look around and see if there's anybody else here. What's... what's going on? They stopped me on the road, a couple of escaped convicts. - The convicts? - Hey, how do you know about us? It was on the radio. What did they say? Something about... about your escape. About a farmer being attacked. - Uh-huh. - What do you want here? Uh... something smells good in there. Just, uh... relax, lady, relax. Hey... hey... hey! - Jeff! - Hey! Connors! - Darling! - I'm... I'm all right. You won't be if you try that again. Well? All clear? There's some music coming from over the garage. And there's light. I thought you said only your wife was here! I thought so, but Raina, didn't she leave this morning? - No, she's leaving tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Who is... who's this Raina? A maid, a maid, I fired her at the beginning of the week, I thought she'd be gone by now. - Will she be coming in the house? - I... I don't think so. Well, then make sure she doesn't, and make you don't leave before we do. Otherwise I'm gonna have to be nasty. Don't make me hit you, lady. I'm a little nervous right now. Alright? I'll... tell you what you'll do. Go in the kitchen and get something to eat for me and the sweet little hubby. Do as he says, Kay. And Sven, make sure she's going to get something to eat. Stay away from that window. Away from the garage and the maid. She's not there. Get on with it! Oh, thanks. Hey, uh... suppose you explain a little more about this. Why kid the wife the way you're doing, huh? I've got my reasons. And if there's any more rough stuff, try and fake it a little. - Oh, when I hit you? - Yes, that's right. Incidentally, now you've achieved your effect with that, I'll take it back... Oh... not just yet. I like the feel of it better in my hand than yours. - Okay, have it your way. - I intend to. Uh... about that phone, do we cut it off? We may need it. Besides, if anyone tried to get through, they'd report the fault. And that would mean a call from the engineer. - How long do we stay here? - Overnight. You're leaving tomorrow. I'll let you know when. Oh, thanks. Hey, that looks good. Come on, put it down, put it down. Come on... look at that! Look at that, come on! Oh boy, I'm hungry! Ah, come on! Hey, where's the fork... give me that. Gimme... gimme... Come on, come on, come on. Easy, easy, will you? Gimme this... Hey, kid, come on. Come on, kid, help yourself. - Come on... - Oh, I'm not hungry. What's the matter, you sick? You don't want to eat, kid? You don't wanna eat, don't eat! Come over here, come on, what about you? No, huh? Well, looks like you knocked yourself out enough, lady. Don't worry about it, there's enough here for me. - Um... what's upstairs? - Only the bedrooms. Hey, Sven, Take her up there, will you? I wanna talk to this guy alone. I'm not leaving. Do as you're told, lady, do as you're told. I got some business with him. It turns out alright, we'll be leaving soon, you can have peace and quiet back here. - Do as he says, Catherine. - Yeah. Lock her in the room, will you? Come on, come on, move! When I tell you people to move, move! Is she, um... is she gonna be alright? She may try something. If she does, it will be your department to stop her. - Which is your room? - Over there. Go in! Go in! She will not hear now even if you shout. Stay over there and keep quiet. Don't try anything. Remember your husband is with us. Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. You remember you talked about a thousand pounds? That's right, Connors. Exactly what would you do for a thousand? A lot of things, especially right now. Go on, go on, test me. Would you... dispose of someone? No... I don't go in for that kind of thing. Hey, Sven... did you hear what this character wants? Yeah, he's mad. Maybe. But not as mad as you'll be if you try to get away without my help. And you won't get that without listening to my proposition. How far do you think you could get anyway... ...without a car, money, anything, and the Swede with a lame foot? The answer's still no. - So you're not interested. - Oh, no, no, no. Twelve years for armed robbery You mean to say you weren't prepared even then? Maybe, maybe not. And you? I believe you've already killed a man. That's right, I did. Then why so squeamish all of a sudden? Look, um... look, mister... We broke away without killing anybody, and I won't start now. At least I'm not. We're not... we're not clean but we don't have to get messy. If we had to, it would be different. - But you will have to. - Yeah? You're a cool cookie, ain't you? I wanna ask you something. Just a matter of curiosity. Just, uh... who is it? Huh? My wife. You're kidding. You ain't kidding. What do you know. Look, um... Look, I want to ask you something. Why? My wife is an attractive woman and a rich one. Some might think me lucky. But I'm the kind who has to make his own life. I still don't get it. Let's say that I have other interests... ...and when I go, I'd sooner go with something besides a suitcase. I still want to know a little more about it. Exactly what your plans are, what you have in mind. Tomorrow morning I go to the bank... ...and come back with a thousand pounds in small notes. My wife has more than one account. One of them is a joint account with me. You two go through with your side of the bargain, take the money and the car and head for Southampton. I have a certain friend there I can call. He can fix you up with passports, tickets, any place you want to go. Then, when you've had sufficient time to get clear, I yell with the story that you two came here, ...and killed my wife when she tried to get away. Simplicity itself. Maybe... maybe not. There are a couple of things wrong there. How are you gonna explain about taking the money out of the bank... ...and about the roadblock, they're gonna remember that. I had to. You found my gun in the car after I'd given you a lift... ...and had it trained on me all the time. As for money, you were holding my wife as hostage. What stops you from making a phone call after we leave? You tie me up. I manage it so that it's some time before I get to the phone, then I tell them I was unconscious most of the time. You really think this is gonna work, huh? I know it will. So now it's up to you. Well, come on, make up your mind, what's it going to be? Hey, hey! - What's that... what's that light? - The bedroom light, quick, get up there! It's the door opposite the stairs. Open up! Open up! Alright, alright... They'll catch you sooner or later. Yeah, yeah, sure. You wanna know what? No more o these tricks. Get out! Get out! - Well? - Okay, I knocked out the light. And my proposition? Let's see your money first. All right. 4:15 on the 22nd. - Any luck, sir? - That call was a false alarm. - Anything new? - No, sir. Five hours and not a sign of them yet. No report of stolen cars or motorcycles? - No, sir. - Then they're still in the district. We'll have a house to house search. Check every farm, cottage and chicken coop in the county. Inspector, Dr. James from the hospital wants to speak to you. Right, put him through. Raglan speaking. What's that? I see. Right, thanks for calling, doctor. The farmer. He died five minutes ago. There must be something we can do. As long as he's got that gun, it's not worth the risk. Did they say when they were leaving? Tomorrow morning, as soon as I've got him some money from the bank. Do you have to? He gave me a pretty good idea of what would happen to you if I didn't. You mean they'd kill me. What good would that do them? I don't know, honey. But I wouldn't like to take a chance on it. What are you doing? Jeff, Jeff, if they're asleep, and they must be pretty worn out, there may be a chance for one of us to slip out and get help. But they've locked the door. I knew there was another key. After he smashed the light I went out looking and found it in the cupboard. I'd forgotten this. What do you think, shall we try? It's after 2 o'clock. There may be... ...just a chance. Come on. Let's try. What's the matter? What's going on? Come on, get back. Come on, get back here. Come on, come on... alright! Where'd you get this key? I found it. Look, it's a long night, you're gonna get some sleep. And, uh... don't try leaving this room again. Hm? We almost got away with it, Jeff. I'm sorry, honey, it was my fault, I should have looked where I was going. I'm scared, Jeff. Don't be, honey, don't be. I'll work it out. You'll see. What was that? Only the post. Oh, Mr. Martin, I didn't know you were back. - What are you doing here? - I just had my breakfast. Well, put it down and go back to your room. - Mrs. Martin isn't well. - Oh, is there anything I can do? No. And until you leave, don't come through the house. Excuse me. Don't worry, I won't disturb you anymore. Jeff! - Hey! - Let me out of here! Alright, alright, alright, come on over here. - Where's my husband? - Ah, he's... He's... he's downstairs having... having breakfast. You want some? I'll, uh... I'll get some for you. No! Breakfast. What's the matter with you? You must eat. - That deal we made... - Killing someone? So much to gain. That shouldn't be hard for you. - The other time it was different. - How? You raided a bank, someone got in the way. You killed him. - It was an accident. - Oh? Do you mind? I gotta keep an eye on you. Please leave me alone! I'm sorry, I gotta do it. You know, you might get up to something, start attracting that girl's attention again. - Let me get dressed. - Sure, sure. Go ahead. You know, you look pretty good in the morning. A lot of women don't. When are you leaving? I'm in no hurry. The duke downstairs is gonna be out of the house for a while. We ought to get together the two of us, huh? Don't you think? - Go on, get out! - Hey, we're not thinking the same way. - Huh? - Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! - Get out! - Come on. Get out... get out! - Get out! - Shut up! Quick. Get upstairs, something's happening. - Look, I'm trying to be nice to you. - What happened? Nothing! Nothing to do with you. Now leave her alone, she's my business. Well, hooray for the boy scouts! I got time, duchess. I got time. Thanks. What are you trying to do, mess everything up? Oh, shut up! - Making a pass at her? - I was only talking. - She got a little rough... - Well, don't make any mistakes! - Look, let's get things straight! - Shut up! You look after your side, I'll look after mine. I am! Now, you heard me phone my friend this morning in Southampton, I tell you we're lucky. He can get you safely aboard a ship that's leaving at 11 o'clock tonight... Yeah, yeah... I heard Lisbon, you said that. - What about the money? - The bank opens soon, I'll get it then. Hey, who's that? It's the police. It's all right, I'll stall them. Now, you keep them all quiet. And let me know when it's safe. Sven... the cops. Get in there! Please don't... Quiet! Okay. - Oh, good morning, Inspector! - Good morning. We're checking the district for a couple of escaped prisoners. You haven't seen anyone around? No, it's only my wife and I here, we haven't seen anything. Be quiet. Well, we're checking all the houses in the district. We believe they may be hiding out somewhere. But you don't think they've left the area? No, they'd need outside help to do that, and as far as we can tell, they had none. Incidentally, they're desperate men, so keep your eyes open. Jeff! What was that? Oh, um... my wife. I think she wanted me to do something for her. You know how it is, Inspector, when your wife wants you to do something. Indeed I do. Well good-bye, Mr. Martin. Good-bye, Inspector. Connors, that's enough, they have gone! Looks like your husband's got more sense than you. Go watch her, come on. - What happened? - She started to yell, I stopped her. - Good! - Not so good. How are you gonna explain to the police your reason for stalling? Simple. I tell them the truth. You had a gun trained on my wife, threatening to blow her brains out if I didn't. Why don't you go away and leave us alone? It's not myself I worry about, it's my husband. - He's a sick man. - Sick? He's been in a hospital for nearly a year and everything... that's happened since you've come... come here, he's liable to lose his health and go back there for life! But what do you mean, what kind of a sickness? - Jeff! - Kay, I'm going to the bank. They've given me their word if I'll do what they say, they won't harm you. I'll be as quick as I can, now... ...try not to worry. - Oh, Jeff, I must talk to you. - There's nothing you can say. Not for the moment. We're in their hands. But Jeff, look... Oh, the happy couple. Are you on your way now? - Yeah. - Good. Hey, Romeo, don't be too long, it makes me nervous to wait. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Oh, good morning, Mr. Martin. - Do you want to take this with you? - Yes, please. Will you excuse me just a moment? Come in. - Good morning, Mr. Martin. - Good morning. I understand you want to cash this check for a thousand pounds. That's right, is there any difficulty? Well, yes... This check as I see is drawn on your mutual account with your wife. As you know, that account is replenished by quarterly remittances from New York. I've just checked, the present remittance is due but hasn't been received yet. But surely there's enough balance to meet that. I'm afraid not, and until it is cleared I'm unable to authorize payment. - But is there anything you can do? - I could call head office. Well, please, go ahead, do that. But I very much doubt whether I get permission before tomorrow. But tomorrow that's impossible, we must have the money today. Then I'm sorry, Mr. Martin, there's nothing I can do until tomorrow at the earliest. Very well, thanks all the same. I thought I told you to stay with her. I have to talk to you, I just learned something. - What did you learn? - This man Martin... ...he was a mental patient. He was in a mental hospital until recently. - He was a what? - His wife told me. Oh... a mental patient. Hey, the guy's nuts. Well, that explains a lot. So even if you make a deal with him, how do you know he can keep his word? Hey look, he may be nuts, by why not? Let's wait for that thousand pounds. I wanna take a look at that jeep, just in case. Come on. - Distributor's gone. - Are we stuck? Yeah, that guy isn't as crazy as you think he is. Hey! Why don't you behave yourself, huh? Is that true what he tells me that your husband's a little, um... huh? He was. He could be again if you don't leave him alone. Look, it's not him I'm worried about, it's me and the Swede what happens to us. If I were you, I would've started worrying a long time ago... ...having a lunatic like that around. What do you mean? Uh-uh! Alright, answer it. No hysterics. Hel... - Hello? - Kay? Jimmy here. What do you want? Yes, he came. He's out at the present moment. Look, will you tell him I got a letter from the hospital? They suggest that I give Jeff a further examination. Nothing to worry about, simply a matter of routine. I see. Well, yes, I'll tell him to get in... to call in. Today? I'm sorry, he can't come today. Tomorrow? Yes... good-bye. You're a pretty nice... nice kid. No kidding. I can't understand people, I just can't. Hey, Sven... Sven, stay here, stay here. I'll take a look. Uh... what are you doing here? I'm looking for some paper to wrap my shoes in, why? Oh, yeah, you're the maid from across the yard. I didn't know Mrs. Martin had a guest. Yes, I'm a friend of the family. Is there something I can do for you? Well, I seem to have all the paper I want. But... you look strong, and I have a suitcase in my room. - Would you like to... help me close it? - Sure, sure, come on. There you are, Henry, right on the nose. - Now it's up to you. - All right. You'll have to do better than that, Henry. Er, Mr. Slade. - Oh, hello, Mr. Martin. Try and hit the board this time. - Can I have a word with you? - In office hours. You ought to know better than that. Blimey, Henry, you've done it. Jeanie, give the gentleman a pint. What about you? No. Look, it's, um... about my car. I want to sell it. Everybody sells this time of year, nobody buys. All the same, I want to sell it and I'm in a hurry. Which one are you talking about anyway? - That Yank job of yours, the jukebox? - Yes. Now, Mr. Martin, what would I want with a car like that? Who around here can afford one of those things? Surely you can make some kind of offer for it. I could, but it'd break your heart. Look, if you want to get rid of it, London's the place. I don't want to go to London, I want to sell it here and now. - What's the hurry? - I need money, that's all. Sorry, I can't help you, Mr. Martin. Well... Mr. Martin, there's no need to be in such a hurry. Now look, um... I could call on them for you. My head office. If they're interested, I could make a deal. - How much would you want? - I figured on a thousand. Oh, they wouldn't go above 800, that's for certain. - Eight hundred, why that's... - That's as high as they'd go. How long will it take you to find out? This afternoon. I can call you at home later. - Okay? - Okay. I'll be there. Always happy to be of service. You're alright. You know, nice... nice place you got here. - Could have been. - Well... why are you leaving? I was fired. I made some remark about crazy people. How was I to know that Mr. Martin... Yes, a little off, huh? Well, that's it exactly. He lost his temper and told me to go. - He's so sensitive. - Oh, sensitive too, eh? Look, I think this is all this one can take. Would you like to help me now? Oh, sure, why not? Well, let me see now, let me see. Hold on, the way you packed this, we both better sit on this. Sure. - Hey, where are you going from here? - I don't know. Nowhere. I'll go along with you, huh? Would you like to hear some music? Alright. It's been a long time. Do you think she'll be all right with him? I... I don't know. The mood he's been in since we escaped is something I don't understand. Why don't you just give yourselves up? You've no chance of getting away. No, I am not going back to that place. But you're not the same as he is. Inside the prison we are all the same. No, not so fast! How about a drink? - There's something in that cupboard there. - Well, I don't drink alone. I'll keep you company. Alright. Hey... What is this here? Hey, look, you got nothing here. Have you got any whisky... or gin, huh? No. Oh, we don't need any, do we? Please... leave me alone, leave me alone. - I thought you liked it... - Please leave me alone. No, leave me alone! No! No! Come on, hm? No! What kind of a dame... What do you got there? What are you hiding? - Nothing, it's nothing. - Come on, what do you got there? It's nothing! No, no... It's nothing, no! Hey. Farmer dies. Don't go up there! Connors, what did you do? I... I don't know. I was reading the newspaper, the farmer died. She come over to take the gun out of my pocket and I... I... it was a mistake. A stupid mistake. Stupid mistake. Hey... hey, give me that. Give me that! Oh... Raina. She's got the gun. - What happened? - He killed Raina. What? - I'll call the police. - No, Kay! Of course I must! Am I glad to see you. Kay, get away from that phone. I don't understand, what do you mean? Nothing, honey. Nothing for you to worry about. In fact, by the time they leave, you won't have to worry about a thing. Let her go, she can't go far. - You knew that that farmer was dead? - Yes! Why... why didn't you tell us? I was saving the information in case I needed it in case you'd try to... ...back out of our plan. I see. Did you... did you bring the money? Not yet. It's coming. Stay here. I want to... I want to talk to her. Stay away from me. You know, Kay, you shouldn't have signed those orders against me. You were sick, you know you were. Months inside that place. You shouldn't have signed. Do you have any idea what it's like to be locked up in a place like that? Cooped up, given that shock treatment. Treated like a madman. And all the time you're sane, perfectly sane. And all because your wife doesn't want you around. All because there's someone else. Oh, we've... we've had all this out before. You know there was no one else. I signed because they advised it. I don't believe you. It was you. And that doctor friend of yours. Between you. Oh, Jeff, what are you going to do? - Those men. - I told you. You won't have to worry from now on. As for Connors and the Swede, I've got to see to it that they make good their escape. That way they get their freedom. And I get mine. And I thought I ought to come and see you about it, sir. I see. When did this happen? Yesterday evening, about 7:30. About 7:30. It's a pity you didn't come sooner. - Go on. - Sorry, sir, I was driving home. I saw this car stop outside the farm entrance... ...and these two men talking to the driver. I didn't pay it no mind at the time... not knowing about the escaped prisoners like. - Can you describe the men? - No, sir, they didn't look particular. - What about the car? - Well, it was a big one. Like an American car, sir. Well, that's a help. What make, year, color, anything at all you can remember about it? Nothing about the color, sir, it was dark. But I do know it was American, so big. All right, well... Thank you very much for coming in. That's all right, sir. Thank you. Good day. - Think there was anything in it, sir? - Perhaps. He saw the incident here, and there was a roadblock at this point. Find out who was in charge of it and have them report here immediately. Yes, sir. Well, one for the road. In the hope we believe in, soon. You know, it'd better be soon, 11:00 at Southampton, you said. That's right! Don't worry, the money will be here! Is he going to be all right, will he back you up? Oh, the Swede. Yeah, he's scared stiff, sure but... when he gets in the car, he'll do anything to protect himself. If I were you, I'd cut out the drinking! Look, look, I'm just worried about the time, it's getting late. You know, it takes two hours to get to Southampton. That guy'd better make that phone call. Will you stop worrying! How can you go through with this plan? He... he needs our help! Look, look, I can give you money if that's what you want. Only help me, please, help me! I can't. Mr. Slade? Martin here. Listen, I got through to the London office. - They've okayed the deal. - It's okay. How long will it take you to get here? Twenty minutes. Look, can you bring the money round with you? Certainly, I can bring the driver and we can settle the whole business. No, no, it's no trouble, only too pleased. - Bye. - Bye. Get the Swede. You've got to help him, he's sick. Hey, Sven, come on down! Please help me! Please help me, help me! Help me. The deal on the car has come through. Is she all right? Yes, she is. Now the jeep, let's fix it up. Swede... You come with me. Connors, you stay. With Kay. Dr. Landers' surgery. Dr. Landers, this is Mrs. Martin here. Oh, Mrs. Martin, he's just outside, I'll fetch him. Miss Douglas! Wait, Miss Douglas! Miss Douglas! - Hello, Kay? - Oh, Jimmy! It's Jeff... It's too late, lady. I told you it was too late. Now... that's okay. I wonder who that can be. Stay! Stay where you are! Well, well. The frightened little man is taking things into his own hands. Don't touch me. No, don't... don't touch me. Connors, stay away from her. Hey, what kind of a game is this? You haven't got the guts, kid. You never did have. I told you, didn't I? Huh? I told you. You stupid kid. Hello? Hello. Hello! Any idea who it was? Uh, yeah... somebody by the name of Jimmy. She, uh... I cut her off. Landers, hm? Um, Mr. Martin, excuse me... Does this change anything? - How? - Well, um... the money was for the two of us, wasn't it? And now you get all of it. I just wanted to know where I stood, that's all. That'll be it. You're a very lucky man, Connors. - And so am I. - Let's get the dough, hm? Come on. - Good evening, Mr. Martin. - You didn't lose any time. Business is business. Besides, the pub closes at 10:30. And if Charlie outside misses his nightcap, he'll be fit for nothing tomorrow. All right, here's the log book. You said the London office agreed to the figure? Oh, yes, no question about that. Here it is, ?800, payable to cash. What is this? I particularly asked for cash. You got the car for nothing, why didn't you do as I said? Mr. Martin, be reasonable. At nighttime I don't have that kind of money on me. - All you have to do is present it tomorrow. - But I want it tonight! In that case there's nothing I can do to help you. - If you want to forget the deal... - No, no, no, no. - I'll have to take it. - Well then, if you'll just sing this receipt. Thank you. You'll find the car in the drive. And here's the... keys. Now, if you'll excuse me. Why, sure, of course - Good night, Mr. Martin. - Good night. - Come in. - Sgt. Brown, sir, you wanted to see him. Oh, yes, Brown. When you were on duty at the roadblock yesterday evening, did anyone drive through carrying two passengers all men, using a saloon car, time about 7:30? - Well, sir, let me think. - Come on, anyone at all! - It was probably an American car. - American? Well, there was one came through, sir. Mr. Martin, from the Cedars. - Martin? - That's right, sir. He had two men with him. Said he'd driven them down from London. House guests, I think sir. When we called there, he said that he and his wife were alone. Didn't you take a look at them? Why yes, sir, as they came by, but they seemed all right to me. Let's go. Where's the cash? Where's the cash? What... what can I do? What can I do with a check? I told him cash, to bring me cash. Where's the... where's the cash? What a sucker I've been, what a sucker. You get a check, he gets a car. What do I get, what about me? What about me? You? You're going through with this thing the way we planned. Oh, hold it, Charlie, hold it. Look, look... you can act as crazy as you want with other people. Not with me! - Look, I'm getting out of here. - No, you don't! I'm not taking any more chances. You're going to do it now. Oh, no... - No... I want cash money... - Yes you will. You want to reason? This... And after you, her. That'd still leave a pretty strong story. How you killed Raina... ...and the Swede, and how I waited my chance and got you. Come to think of it, I'd end up a hero. Yeah... you could at that. Okay, I'll play it your way. Good, good. So let's come down with it now. Go up those stairs. Now. In the meantime, I'll get the jeep going. I... I've had enough, I'm cured. I've had enough of this. I'm cured, kid. I really have... Wait, wait, I'll get you untied now. Just take it easy. Look, lady... I'm gonna help you get out of here alive. Understand me, huh? I... I don't unders... I don't understand! - I don't understand! - Now wait! Shh. Come on... listen, listen to me. Listen, I'm gonna get you out alive. Listen to me... get over here. Come on, over here. Hey! Did you see her? She got away. Over there. Get through. I knew something was wrong. What is it? Quick, in there. Kay, it's no good running anymore! You bastard, you... What's that bell? It's the police. Stay there. I'll get rid of them. No, no, no. Now look, get the jeep. Drive it in here, go on! Go on. Hey... look. Now please be quiet. I'm not gonna do anything to you. Just be quiet. What did I do that for? I don't trust that guy. Hey, guy... Mrs. Martin. I'm afraid I have bad news for you. An old hand like that, he should have known better. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
