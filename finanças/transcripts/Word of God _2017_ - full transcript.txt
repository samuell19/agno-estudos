Subtitles by explosiveskull WORD OF GOD On Saturday the 26th April 1986... ...the Soviet nuclear power plant Chernobyl exploded. One week later, God's youngest son wrote his very first poem. CHAPTER 1 GOD'S ELDEST SON AND THE SOUP It was the same day that God expected a visit from his eldest son. God's eldest son had stayed away for several years. I'm not afraid. God wasn't afraid. - Uff'? - Mama hoped it would be a good day. It'll be fine, right? - Uffe, it will be fine. - Yes, yes... Your eldest son wants to make peace. Isn't that a good thing? And no alcohol on the table. We respect that Mikkel doesn't drink. Uffe? No schnapps in the soup. Will you love me until death do us unite? - Jens? Mikkel's coming home. - Mama? Should a poem rhyme? A poem? Ask Papa. He knows everything about that. Should a poem rhyme? - Are you writing poems now? - Should it rhyme? A poem should have rhythm. A poem should almost be like a bloodbath. A massacre of words killing one another. A bottle cap against a record player. Like a kiss from the angel of death. - Or a quick fuck. - Also if it's for a girl? - Jens? Will you fetch Thomas? - Why me? - He's doing boyish things. - Jens? Trousers. God's middle son hadn't been outside for three months. But God didn't know. What's your record? What? - What's the record? - Seven forty-something. - What's up? - Mikkel's on his way from Aalborg. How does God feel? - He's cooking soup. - Shit. This is a freaking work of genius, Jens. It's good. But your handwriting is terrible. - Gerd, where's my typewriter? - Not now. What the hell? And on that Saturday, God saw his typewriter again. In his younger days, God wanted to be a writer. It never happened. - Who hid it there? - Why should I hide it? God became a psychologist and worked at the city hospital. And the typewriter disappeared in Mama's Swedish storage chest. This thing has demonic powers. - It's just Mama's old storage chest. - They're already here! Trousers, Uff'! Shouldn't we go inside, Mikkel? - Do you smell it? - It wasn't me. - He's made soup. - That's lovely. I'd love some. It's his army soup. Made on gas and old rusty military equipment from the fifth regiment. But it's edible, right? There's triumph soup and fear soup. Today, it's fear soup. Mikkel, what's this really about? - Lots of things. - Such as? He... He can't stand churches. Free churches, in particular. Why didn't you tell me before we drove all the way from Aalborg? And he can't stand overweight people either. - Do you think I'm overweight? - Not at all. You look fine to me. I'm sorry, Maria. Let's leave. No! Let's go inside, Mikkel. - The soup's made on gas? - Yes. My own gas cylinder. - I see. - Gas is the trick. But the recipe will only be released when I'm on my deathbed. - To whom? - To the person that deserves it. How about that. Eh, Mikkel? - We don't have any vegetables. - No, Uff'. Not today. It's okay, Mama. - What about Thomas, Jens? - He had to beat his record. What record? - You know I don't drink anymore. - How would I know after three years? But in this house, we drink beer. - Let's taste the soup. - Cheers. Well, it's a lovely soup. Lovely? It's vigorous. It's powerful. And it doesn't make you fat. - Hey there. - Hi. - There's my second son. - Did you beat your record? - You might wonder what he does. - Yes. What do you do, Thomas? Thomas is taking a higher preparatory course. Oh well. All right. That's what he's doing. I guess I'll learn what that is one day. - You met at the hairdresser school? - Yes. And what does one study there? Weekly magazines? Ladies' magazines? Hello there! The reinforcements have arrived. Hello, Uffe. We've brought reinforcements. Why are those fruitcakes here today? - They are my friends. - No, Uffe. They are your patients. Do you need reinforcements to see your son? "If there were no penal code, he wanted to use his biggest car..." Here's Swedish buns and coffee. There you go. "...use his biggest car as an axe and kill me, my wife and my child." Sofus Schandorff, ladies and gentlemen. Bravo. Ingemar Glans. I'm Uffe's bravura piece. At the nuthouse, they gave me pills. Then I emptied the medicine glass and dropped dead. Dead as a doornail. And there sure as hell wasn't any divine tunnel light. I ended up in an ambulance. But did you survive? Yes. And they sent me over to Uffe. You know what he gave me? - No. What? - Literature. Uffe doesn't give you medicine if you feel bad. How do they feel about literature in the Carola Sect, Maria? I can't tell what the Carola Sect feels. But it's lovely what you do with literature. Does Miss Carola know of the magical power of words? Well, she must have read the big book. Jens, read your poem. We didn't come to eat your shit soup and listen to shit poems. Do you even care why we are here? Mikkel and I are getting married. We're getting married, damn it! In a free church and shit. Move. Here's an invitation. But you don't need to come. You can snuff it for all I care. Thanks for now, Uffe. And for your information, our church is called "The Path of Life". Jesus is to me what gas is to you. Call Mikkel and tell him that we are looking forward to his wedding. According to God, your sex life dies after seven years of marriage. Gerd? It's Saturday. So God and Mama had agreed to love each other... ...on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Whether the desire was there or not. CHAPTER 2 JUDGMENT OF GOD Josefine? What happens if you get rid of the pills? Then I'll panic. - And if you keep them? - Then I won't panic. So those chemical bastards control your life. Do you want that, Josefine? Is that okay? - I can't. - You can't? Or won't? - It's not that simple. - Yes, it is. Uffe, can I talk to you? - Can it wait? - No, it had better be now. Emergency. I'll be right back, Josefine. Uffe! - Malignant? - Yes. And aggressive. Then remove the bastard. Just get rid of it. I'm sorry, Uffe. I can't. It's spread. I see. How long do I have? Six months. Perhaps less if we don't do something. - Chemotherapy. - Life-prolonging chemotherapy, yes. - It's poison. - That's one opinion. - That's my opinion. - Yes, it is. But cancer is not a mental illness. What would a physician know about that? I have something here that I don't have. If you know what I mean. It's a brand new drug from the USA that we're testing off the record. Special connections. I won't be a goddamn American guinea pig. - Uffe? - Yes? If there's something you want to get done, you had better do it now. Why are you home? Uff'? When God was a little boy and life hurt... ...he would hide in his Arabic corner. Here, he was safe from the evils of the world. It was still like that. I'm a reference point in a suburb. Why won't he take his medicine? Dad is in his Arabic corner. He just needs to consider it. - What about me? - What about you? If he's going to be dying here for six months? - Why don't you go back to school? - I can't, pet. Uff', the boys don't understand what is happening. Neither do I. Then I'll tell you what's going to happen. I'm going to Jailhouse. Who said I'm going to give up? Eh? When God went to Jailhouse, he would normally stay away for two days. There he met with the whores, the pickpockets and the rowdies. At Jailhouse, God felt like a human being. At Jailhouse, God was just Uffe. I cured a schizophrenic sailor. And I've shared a taxi with a singer. Jens? What about my second son? Eh? Isn't he going with you? Isn't he going to school? Gerd! Gerd. - Dad is home. - What if he finds me here? Maybe you could try to leave the house a little. You can't lie here all your life. You understand that, don't you? The second son had dropped out of school. He was in his weightless phase, afraid to disappear from the Earth. He called it agoraphobia. He had read it in one of God's books. CHAPTER 3 SOUP AND SOLDIERS Gerd? - The door. - I'm not expecting anyone. Hold your horses. - What's this? - Says who? Pia's mother. Pia from your son's class. "Will you love me until death do us unite as mould... ...lying in our maggot graves, feasting upon each other?" Yes. It's good. Jens attacked Pia with this. It's mental violence. No. It's actually a very good poem. Pia is 14. She shouldn't be traumatized with thoughts of worms and death. This, Mrs Pia's mother, are life's great questions. But you don't discuss that at home? Life's great questions? Idiot. This, Mrs Pia's mother, is great art. Are you listening, Mrs Pia's mother? We are all going to die. So we write poems, so we can bear the fact that we are going to die. Does nothing stir within you? Do you lead the life you dream about? Those who are afraid to dream are afraid to live. It makes them ill. You are ill. Yes. I'm ill. And very soon, I'm going to die. I should have been a writer. Written novels. But the words are now a growth, eating me up from inside. You need help. A lot of help. - Then help me. - There must be medicine. There is no medicine for a wasted life. Or damn words that get stuck. - Go home and write the damn words. - I can't. You can't or you won't? Mom? Give Jens my best and say thanks. Thank you, Jens. I am going to die. Something got stuck inside me. Something wicked has invaded my body. But... I have decided... ...to fight the evil with the strongest medicine around. - Words. - Words. I will fight the devilry with the most dangerous weapon in existence. - Words. - Words. But I can't do it alone. I need you. You must be my soldiers. You must protect me. - Protect you against what, Uffe? - Against myself. Yes. Against myself. Against this. The fear, the anxiety, the devilry, the madness. My family! This moment... It... It's a holy moment. Can you feel it? Feel this moment. Hold on to this moment. Now, Uffe Blendstrup declares that we are at war! Soldiers! Get up. Rise. March! Every morning at 8:00, you will come here in pairs. - Make sure that I write. Understood? - Yes. God had declared war on death. His plan made the house tremble and moved the furniture. Mama's storage chest had swallowed God's typewriter and so it had to go. It was Mama's only piece of furniture from Sweden. Swedish Devil. Devil! The peace of God's kingdom was endangered. And the second son soothed his fear by beating more records. It's 8 o'clock. CHAPTER 4 WAR AND DOWNFALL This is the News. The consequences of the nuclear accident in Chernobyl... ...will be much more severe than the Soviet authorities initially stated. American experts believe that more than 300 people in the area will die soon... ...and more than 10,000 will suffer from radiation damage. - We're also affected by this. - Shit. The radioactive waste from the accident has been detected in cow's milk... When God was young and wanted to be a writer, he lived in Paris. He bought a writer's jacket from Hemmingway's old tailor. But the words were stuck... ...so God went home to become a reference point in a suburb. I'm leaving now. Mama? Hello! Here's the writing guard. - We have pastry from the baker's. - I see. Yes... - Let's go, Uffe. - Hush. Mein Kampf A - What does that mean? - Beer. A family chronicle What is it, Uffe? Mrs Blendstrup? The writer wants to know, if you could please stop doing that. Tell the writer that the roof has Chernobyl plague. I must remove it. Otherwise, we'll get ill like him. Uffe, the roof has plague and emits dangerous radiation. Gerd? Could you respect that "Mein Kampf" takes place between 8 am and 1 pm? Fine. Then you can fix the roof, when you are done playing Hitler. Daddy is at war, so I'm going out for a while. For how long? Until the fruitcakes are gone, so I can have my house back. What about me? Maybe you should tell your dad about this... A-go-ra-pho-bia. Yes. The agoraphobia. - Bye. - Gerd? Uffe? I dreamt that I woke up with my mom's penis in my mouth. Don't you think that's an Oedipus complex? Mrs Blendstrup? A letter for you. It's from Sweden. I see. Thank you. Mama once knew a Swedish man. The only one apart from God. Now, the Swedish man had sent her a letter more than 25 years later. His wife was dead, and he was alone. He just wanted to know if Gerd Lillian was alive and well. Will radioactive fallout in the grass affect the Danish dairy cows? Well, Danish dairy cows will eat the radioactive grass. You can't see if something is radioactive. It's not like the grass turns grey. So it's a hidden danger, but you can detect it using advanced equipment. Thank you, nuclear physicist Peter H. Larsen. And here's the weather report: Due to a high pressure... ...summer has arrived. Up to 30 degrees Celsius today. The heat wave will probably last a few more days. So if you don't necessarily need to be in the sun, stay in the shade. The roof still has the plague - How long did you hide here? - A couple of days. No. It's longer than that. - A week? A month? Three months? - What does it matter? - Does your mother know? - It doesn't matter. This is my house. I worked and paid for every single brick. So I want to know what the hell is going on. Nobody can slack here! Get dressed and get out in the garden. The roof has plague. It must be cleaned, or we'll all die of cancer. According to doctor Gerd. No. I'm not going up there. Why not? Because I have agoraphobia. I see. Well, well. Do you know anything about what a phobia is? Do you know what a writer is? Just get to work. Use your body. Use your strength. Use your body, Thomas. Use your strength, Thomas. All your strength. Use your whole body. The whole body! Right, left. Right, left! Right, left. Gerd. Uffe, we need some clear guidelines. Let's call it a day. Uff'? Uffe? We need to talk. Let's give him an oxygen mask. An oxygen mask... Yes, let's do that. Gerd? Thomas is under observation until tomorrow. I'll sleep in his room. It's Tuesday. Yes. You sent your son to the hospital with a nervous breakdown... ...and you expect a reward? I tried to get him up, but someone let him lie down a bit too long. - You ought to have seen his problems. - Well, you kept him hidden. It's so damn important for you to save all the other fruitcakes. - But you hit your son. - I just woke him up. The way you woke Mikkel up? You are a miserable little man, Uffe. Even now when you are lying here dying. For the first time in years, Tuesday was cancelled in God's house. And for the first time, Mama had been writing a letter to God all night. CHAPTER 5 THREE COMMANDMENTS FOR GOD It was not a long letter. And it was not a loving letter. And it was written in Swedish. How is Thomas? Mama. Mama? Before you start, I want you to do three things. One: Pick up Thomas and apologize to him. Two: Accept medical treatment for your illness. I don't do medicine. Three: Call Mikkel... ...and tell him that we are looking forward to his wedding. - I won't go to church. - Yes, you will. And you will behave. That was four things. Four things. In return, you don't have to make a speech. A father makes a speech for his son. Mikkel wants his brothers to make the speech. - Fine. Jens can do it. He is a genius. - What about me? You will make the speech at your big brother's wedding. Three things. The one thing God feared was... ...when the Swedish demons danced in Mama's brown eyes. You can do it, honey. You can do it. I can't go with you. I have to go to school. No. You need to go with me. Today, the U.S. detonated its 774th atomic bomb... ...since the very first one in 1945. The nuclear test was conducted in the Nevada Desert... Step aside, pet. By doing this, the U.S. is provoking the entire world... ...the news agency Tass. And now to the World Championships in Mexico... Well, Thomas... I hope you are man enough to accept an apology. Could the clever people help you? You got some medicine, I presume? Valium. Just remember that I tried to apologize. My father was My father was mayor and he hit us The pain made us cry May we hear it? "My father was mayor in Randers. He hit us Wednesdays and Saturdays." "The pain made us cry." "He wanted a statue in the square." "He didn't get it." Sentimental rubbish. - Uff'. - I apologized. Yes, I know. Do you know that your 18-year old son hasn't had his sexual debut yet? His friends have tried it. All of them have tried it. - Gerd... - No, it's not Tuesday. Listen to me. I think his fear and phobia have something to do with it. We can't help him with his sexual debut. - Yes. You can. - I can? There are girls who can help sexually frustrated boys. You have such a girl in your therapy group. If you help me... Or if you help Thomas with this... - Then it's Tuesday again. - Aye aye, miss. CHAPTER 6 LIBERATIONS Thomas. - I'm going to the hospital with Dad. - Okay. - He's decided to receive treatment. - Okay, cool. Jens is at the beach with Pia. Have a good time. - Everything is good, right? - Yes. One piece of boy virginity, bought and paid for. Thank you, Uff'. Thank you. - Do you know your dad saved my life? - No. One, two, three... Cheers, Uffe. Shit. Jens? What did you do in my room? Did you jack off on my bed? I fucked Josefine! - But it was a quickie. - In my bed? You know she's a hooker? I know she's one of God's writing guards. When she's not spreading her legs at Hotel La Tour on Randersvej. Big deal. But you used a condom, right? - Otherwise, you should get checked. - For what? For AIDS, moron! You're dead. Where were you? I was at the playground. - No, the beach. - No, the playground. Have you had anal penetration? - How many men have you had sex with? - No-one... Why would you have gotten AIDS, then? - I got raped by a hooker. - Raped? How? By someone from Hotel La Tour on Randersvej. - Do you have a name? - Josefine. - Just Josefine? - She's one of Dad's writing guards. We'll take a blood test. You'll have an answer in three months. The hearing is a proof of rising panic. Now, it seems that AIDS is spreading from the ghetto... ...we thought it would stay within, to other parts of the population. - Not just homosexuals? - No. But via junkies working as hookers it spreads to heterosexuals. - Is this a case of mass panic? - Yes. You could say it's exacerbated by irresponsible people... Thank you. CHAPTER 7 WEDDING AND PRAYER - Jens, can we hear it now? - Hear what? The speech to your big brother and his bride. - I don't think it's any good. - Of course it is. You are a genius. Right, Uff'? - You can do it, Jens. - Come on, Jens. Pet. Now, you are married, the two of you who love each other. When you have kids and grandkids, I'll be the dead uncle. I ate from the flower of sin, as poisonous as tobacco. Withered and sweet. Good luck from Jens Dead. That was very strange, Jens. That's not good at all. Once I was lonely and dizzy I fumbled around in my life My heart was without hope My spine was like a fluttering rush I sought refuge in the bottle I was crawling up a wall My plans came to nothing Whilst death set my watch I have found my path in life A path as wide as an ark My sins are now forgiven By the man who ploughs my field - It's true that Heaven exists - It's true! - It's true that God exists - It's true! - It's true that His son is a master - It's true! - We obey His holy commands - It's true! Now I know that Heaven exists Now I know that God exists Now I know His son is a master We obey His holy commands Dear Mikkel. Dear Maria. I'm not going to make a speech. I promised my spouse that. That's how the men are in this family. We obey our wives. But I'll do it anyway. Because the men in the family are also like that. - Just so you know, Maria. - I already knew. Right, Mikkel? It's no secret, Mikkel, that you and I have, at times, had our issues. I was probably the problematic one. If you ask my wife, that is! I tried making you into a heathen. That went wrong! You chose your own path in life. And that is good. You must choose your own way in life. You must choose your own way in life. However, I would like to give you some fatherly advice. Don't love in good times and bad times. Do it Tuesday and Saturday! It works. Just ask my wife! Thanks, father-in-law. - Thanks, Dad. - Don't mention it. As my father, Uffe, said: We have had our issues. I found solace in a bottle. But I don't do that anymore. Bravo. - Thanks to Jesus and your prayers. - Hear, hear! Thanks to that, I found the light and the path. So thank you. My father has a serious illness. So I want us all to say a prayer for Uffe. No, Gerd. Our Lord Jesus, who never ignored people's cries for help. I ask of you: Choose the light for Uffe when all he sees is darkness. Help him up when he falls, and deliver him from his illness. Amen! Amen! No, Gerd. Uffe... I think it's time we go home. Just across the table from me, a lady is eating. She's bellowing with laughter. But she's also an unhappy lady. And a fat lady. She once entered the holy church. And now she's here... ...with her bogus faith, just getting fatter, fatter and fatter. Just like the rest of you. You're sitting here ballooning. Because you're soothing yourselves with Jesus and lemon mousse. You can't open up and love each other. Love each other, damn it! Not that fool who's hanging on the cross over there. Damn it all! Damn it! It's true that Heaven exists It's true that God exists It's true that His son is a master... It was fortunate that God was dying. Or they would have killed him in Aalborg. But God didn't agree. Well, I'm just being honest. God refused to give up. He still believed in the magic power of words. And what about Mama? She no longer knew what she was hoping for. CHAPTER 8 THE MIRACLE IN RISSKOV - Cured? - Yes. He's cured. So he is in good health? But... Just like that? Pop! No, thank you. A miracle? Not in our view. We check the patient and make a diagnosis. And then we treat the patient, based on specific knowledge. Isn't that right, Uffe? I hope you are grateful now. I thank my willpower. Yes, your willpower is great. But do remember to say thank you to Mikkel and his congregation. They prayed for you. I've healed myself. And I will not thank anybody. Not Mikkel and his holy hypocrites or some mumbo-jumbo medicine. I will not thank anybody. My writing healed me. You understand? Sure. Whatever. - So what happens now? - I will celebrate it. With the people who believed in me. - What are you doing? - Going out. - You are doing great, eh? - Valium. - Thomas... - Yes, pet? What is it? I have plaque on my tongue. That's from AIDS. - You think so? - Show me. Yes... Disgusting. Mama? I have plaque on my tongue. - It's AIDS. - No, not now, Jens. You must talk to your dad about that. - I have plaque on my tongue. - The whole world has plaque. It can kill you in seven years. - Plaque? - AIDS. Sausage poisoning can kill you in three days. Jens Blendstrup is dead. 15 + 7 = 22 years Jens? Remember that Dad must bring in the chest. Mama? YOUNG MEN DOOMED BY AIDS Gerd? Gerd. Gerd! The youngest son knew that his blood was poisoned. That his body would soon be eaten by worms and mites. Because the youngest son had fucked the angel of death. I'm sleeping. I want to apologize. But there was one thing he didn't know. It was supposed to have been the other one. Your brother. You father asked me to help him, Thomas, with his first time. That's what I do. Or did. Once. He understood it now: God had sent the angel of death. - Have you been tested? - For what? AIDS, damn it! - Murderer. - Well... Anyway, I'm sorry... It was God who killed his own son. "Have you placed mockery on the army table? Then don't look back." "There were two aunts in Love, who were exasperating their Delphias." Bravo, Uffe. Bravo! - Bravo. - Bravo. It's crap. It's fucking crap. Yes. Jens is right. It's fucking crap. Uffe? What are you looking at? What the hell are you looking at? Fools. Fruitcakes. Sycophants. Yes-men. Get out of my house. Go home! Go home. Be gone. Out. Get out of here! Why is happiness so capricious? And why is joy so short-lived? Life is often so senselessly hard... Gerd? I'm not afraid. Gerd? Fruitcakes. Out. Out! Gerd? Gerd! Breakfast rolls. Where's Mama? Mama said that Dad had to bring in the chest himself. CHAPTER 9 SODOM AND GOOD MORNING - And then? - And then she left. - And she left? - She left. Thomas, call Mikkel. Call him yourself. - This is Mikkel. - It's Uffe. Who? - Uffe Blendstrup. Your father. - What's happened? - Is Gerd at your place? - Did she run away? - Well, it would seem so. - Then find her. Did you kill her? On Saturday the 25th of October 1986... ...six months after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl... ...God's kingdom suffered a meltdown. A chain reaction triggered by a poem. If the youngest son hadn't written his poem to Pia... ...God wouldn't have found his typewriter. And Mama's storage chest wouldn't have been thrown out. And the second son wouldn't have fallen from the roof. And no-one would've gotten AIDS. And Mama wouldn't have disappeared. God was right. A poem was like a bloodbath, a massacre of words killing each other. A quick fuck. A bottle cap on a record player. It's the police. Gerd? The two of us don't need to talk. I'm only here to support my brothers. Jens. Tell him there are beers in the fridge and soup in the pot. - There are beers and soup, he says. - No thanks. No thanks, he says. I heard him. Our Lord Jesus. Aid our family in this hour. Just stop, Mikkel. If Gerd and Uffe are lost, show them the right path... Stop it. No-one here needs that shit. - That shit saved my life. - But it doesn't work here. We prayed for you at the wedding, and you were healed. Lord, give us a sign... Oh, shut up! Well done, Thomas. - Why is Mama's storage chest out here? - It has demonic powers. Who says that? God. And you guys believe that? No. Thomas? No. Why didn't you just take it inside? We need some vegetables. What about God? We have French fries. And fried chicken. And spring rolls. Mikkel is drinking beer again. And here's yesterday's soup. When Mama hugs you, you can feel her boobs. You can feel them for a long time after the hug itself. Has Uffe ever hugged you? No. Maybe no-one ever gave Uffe a hug. - Maybe Uffe needs a hug. - Let me out now. That's hard with him lying there. Let me out now. Well, Uffe... Now, you're standing up. You will get a hug now. Are you ready? We're giving you a hug now, Uffe. Can you feel it? Uffe? Stop that nonsense. I want out now. Enough. I need to get out now. Open it. Damn it! Jens, I need to get out now. You can do it. The others can't, but you can. Jens! Let me out right now! Wretched brats. I'll kill you! Hallo? What on earth? Mama? I never want to know what happened. Never. And no-one will ever ask me where I went. No-one. Never ever. Is that understood? We are a family. It's a good thing to be a family. CHAPTER 10 LIFE AND DEATH, THERE AND BACK Negative. HIV negative. - Cleared. - You mean healthy? - How does science explain this? - Well, we can't. Such things occur. You know, shit happens. It can sort of hide inside the body, and then it resurfaces. How long do I have left? Well... Uff'? It's Tuesday. When the moon rises in the sky And looks in through the window From time to time I get pensive And play softly on my lute And you are happy, clear moon Who can be so high above the Earth And just observe And just observe. CHAPTER 11 THE LAST SOUP Thomas. My boy... The second son. I don't care. I'm going to die anyway. Thomas... Do get going with the ladies. Or men. And lose the pills. Five bouillon cubes. Bouillon cubes... Per one liter of water. 500 grams of whole onions. With the skin. Whole onions with the skin. And? Heat it on gas. And schnapps. Thanks, Dad. I'm sure you'll do well. Gerd? I am... ...afraid. There's something I never told you that I want you to know. Every day I've gotten up, and before I've woken up the boys... ...I have had some alone time. And I've said a prayer. And that prayer has helped me. So that I had the strength to love you all those years. So whether you want to accept it or not... ...God has been a big and important part of your life. Yes... Now you know. Ladies and gentlemen. "No man is an island." "Entire of itself." "Every man is a piece of the continent." "If a clod be washed away by the sea... ...as well as if a promontory were, as well as any manner of thy friends... ...or of thine own were..." - Let's express our thanks. - Yes. Yes. The great reference point has left his suburb. There are no more Tuesdays and Saturdays. The Arabian corner is abandoned. The last bouillon cube has been stacked. It is Uffe who is dead. What is left is just the anger, the fear... ...the longing, the madness... ...and the dream. From now on, the rest is up to us. Whether we want it or not. Who gave you the jacket? - God did. - Pet.
