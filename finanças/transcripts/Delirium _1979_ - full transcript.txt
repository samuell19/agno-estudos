(Suspenseful music) (Engine rumbling) (Dramatic music) (Solemn music) -Jenny? Jenny? Are you alone? (Woman screaming) (Dramatic music) (Siren wailing) (Chattering on police radio) - Well, what have we got, wallerman? - Better go see for yourself. It's up on three. - Hello, Paul. - Busy night tonight? - Aren't they all? What we got? - Well, take a look. (Camera clicks) - Oh, shit. That's pretty grim. - Sure is. - Who's the girl? - Her roommate. Her name's Susan norcross. - Did you get anything out of her? - No. - I figured I'd wait until you two get down here. This one's all yours. - Larry, I want you to go over and see if you can calm her down. We're gonna need her for some questions after a while. -Are you all right? - Do you have to leave her hanging like that? Can't you take her down? - I'm sorry, miss, but we need to get as much detailed information as possible. Photographers will be done soon. - I want this whole damn apartment dusted for prints. - I'll get right to it, sir. - Larry? Here's where they must've started. - Yeah, look at this. Undennear's not torn. Looks like she took 'em off herself. - She must have been in one hell of a hurry to get dressed. - Medical examiner's finished. He's taking the body down now. - Oh, were you able to get any prints? - They're on the way to the lab. - Let's go see if we can talk to the girl now. (Solemn music) (Susan crying) I'm very sorry about your roommate. It'd be a big help if you could give us as many details about her as you can remember. - Her name's Jennifer Thompson. She moved in here about three months ago. - Do you have any idea who she was with tonight? - He said his name was Charlie. He was up at my boss's office the other day, looking for a job or something. Then we ran into him tonight. - Go on, miss. - I said hello. We talked for a while about my boss, and... Then I introduced him to Jenny. Well, they seem to hit it right off, and they were talking and dancing and everything. Later on, Jenny came up to me and asked me if I mind finding another ride home, and I said no. And she left with that guy. - Miss norcross, can you describe this man for us? - He's about six feet tall. Dark hair. I guess he's about 25. - Can you tell us anything else? - You could check with my boss. He's got the guy's application. - How can we get a hold of your boss? - Oh, he lives out in the county. Mr. Donald Andrews, he's in the phone book. - I'll phone this in. I'll be right back. - Do you have a friend or relative you'd like to stay with tonight? - I have a friend that lives upstairs I could probably stay with. - Wilson and Ivy are gonna go out and talk to this Mr. Andrews. They'll call us if they get anything. Well, miss norcross, I'm wondering if you'd look around the apartment and see if anything's missing. - Jenny's purse is missing. Probably has her keys too. (Tense music) (Woman screaming) (Suspenseful music) (Woman crying) (Dramatic music) (Alarm buzzing) - Good morning. How you feeling? Did you get any sleep at all last night? - I gotta get moving. Just have to call my boss and tell him I'm not coming in. (Water running) (Phone ringing) - Hello. - Miss norcross? Yeah, this is detective mead. Listen, I called because we'd like for you to come down to the station today, if you can. - Can I come down around noon? -All right, well it's the detective bureau, 12th and Clark, fourth floor. That's right. Okay, we'll see you then. (Eerie music) (Explosion booming) - [Man] Incoming! (Explosion booming) (Man shouting) (Gunshots banging) (Birds chirping) (Car engine starting) - Hey, that's my car! (Engine roaring) (Tires squealing) Bring back my car! - Thanks. Where you headed? Something wrong? (Tense music) (Tires screeching) - [Woman] What's wrong? Charlie? What's the matter with you? What are you doing?! Charlie! Charlie, you're crazy!! (Woman screaming) (Horn honking) (Tires squealing) (Birds chirping) (Machines whirring) (People chattering) - Well, Larry, I told you that broad wasn't right. Hell, the coroner says she wasn't even laid. What did Wilson and Ivy get from Mr. Andrews? - Oh, he wasn't much help. Said this guy came in and the other day to apply for a job. He didn't have any references, so he didn't even keep him around. Didn't bother to have him fill out an application. - You mean he just walked in and walked out? - That's what they gave me. - Well, maybe he's one of those weirdos that goes around office buildings sizing up all the broads. Hey, why not check on vice? See if they got something that might fit him. - Hey, look at this. Remember Peter Sykes? - Oh, hell yes. Let's see, we had that guy tied on about five robberies and two murders. What's he up to now? - He's up to getting buried. Found the son of a bitch in the Mississippi last night. Suicide. - Horseshit, Sykes a suicide? Come on! That guy pulled more fuckin' string than a dozen puppet shows to beat all those raps. He wouldn't kill himself after all that. - Well, there wasn't anything on him to change the verdict. We found his car parked down near the east bridge, and he even had a note on the dashboard. See what you can find. - Man, I wish our friend Charlie would go out and kill himself. Save us one hell of a lot of work. (Waves lapping) - Do you know you almost got us killed out there? Are you okay? Well, I'm going for a swim. - [Woman] What's wrong? (Tense music) Charlie? What's the matter with you? - Come on in, the water's nice. What's wrong, can't you swim? Are you ashamed of your birthday suit? - [Woman] Hey, don't worry about it, Charlie. It happens to the best of men. It's okay. Oh, sure, I'm gonna tell everyone I know that you can't get it up. (Suspenseful music) (Woman screaming) (Waves lapping) - Hey Tom, look! - Mom, dad! Look out there! - (Indistinct) Strip search. Do you have the license number, son? I'll have a car drop over and (indistinct). - Hey Romeo, julietjust walked in. - Oh. - Have any trouble getting the day off? - No. - Let me get you a chair. - Thanks for coming down. We really appreciate it. We notified your roommate's parents last night. - Are they all right? - They took it pretty tough. And we still haven't got anything on her car. This Charlie character, absolutely nothing. Incidentally, your boss wasn't much help. - I thought he had an application from the guy. - He told us the man didn't even have any references, so he didn't even bother having him fill one out. - Well, this guy really wasn't in Mr. Andrew's office long enough for an interview, but he was in a good mood when he left it. It doesn't make sense, does it? - Well, we're going over again this afternoon and had another talk with him. You know, our men got him out of bed last night. - Do you feel up to looking at some mugshots? - Hey Parker. Take miss norcross down to identification. (People chattering) (Phone ringing) - We'll see you later, okay? - Okay. - What are you gonna do, adopt her? - That's not a bad idea. - Come on. Let's pay a visit to her boss. - Send them in. - Mr. Andrew. I'm detective sergeant Paul dollinger. This is my partner, Larry mead. - How you do. - Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - [Andrews] Would you like a cup of coffee? - [Paul] No thanks, I've had plenty. - What can I do for you? - Well, we know you've already had to answer some questions. - Yes, in the middle of the night, as a matter of fact. - Well, sir, I'm very sorry for that inconvenience, but we were hoping that since you had some time to think it over, that you just might recall something. - No, I told those officers last night everything I know. As a matter of fact, I spent the rest of the night trying to think of something. - And this man didn't have any references? - None. And I don't hire people without references. - But he did introduce himself. - [Andrews] Yes. - Do you remember what his last name sounded like? - No, he did mention a last name, but I can't recall it. I'm sorry I can't help you, but- Mr. Andrews, we have one hell of a brutal murder on our hands. I'm afraid the only lead we have ends right here in this office. - I've told you everything I know. What more do you want from me? - This man comes to you for a job. You think enough of him to get him an interview. Yet all we get from you is a goddamn first name. - What the hell have I got to do with it? - Look, a young woman was murdered. The roommate of one of your secretaries. And this man could very well be the killer. - Well, gentlemen, I'm sorry that I can't help you. But I'm really rather busy today. I'll have to ask you to leave. - If you remember anything, you will call us. - Oh yes, of course. I'll call you. (Door closes) - Weren't you crowding him a bit? - Oh, maybe. I thought I could shake something loose. - Oh, you think he's hiding something? - I don't know. But if he is, you and I are gonna find out. (Elevator dings) - Let me talk to stern. - [Stern] Stern. - [Andrews] Listen, the police were just here another time. Now they get to Charlie before you do and he talks. - Look, I told you not to worry. I'll take care of Charlie, just go about your business as normal. And remember we got a meeting tonight. (Tense music) (Knocking on door) That fool Andrews. He's afraid Charlie would might talk to the police if they get to him before we do damn. Was afraid something like this might happen. - You don't think Charlie would rat on his old army buddies, now do you? - Well, we both know what Charlie's capable of. He flipped out once before. We don't know what he's going to do now. - [Man] You think he'll show for the meeting tonight? (Stern sighs) - I don't know. I really don't know. (Knocking on door). Come in! - The matter of Mr. Sykes, sir, it's reached the newspaper. - Good. Very good. Now we gotta find Charlie. Mark, you get a man on that, and both of you - get things ready for tonight. - Yes, sir. - I only hope Charlie can avoid the cops until we get to him. - He's been doing that ever since he got out of that hospital. (Tense music) (Birds chirping) (Horse neighing) (Suspenseful music) (Cow moos) (Tense music) (Cow moos) (Tense music) (Cat meows) (Cat meowing) - Hi, Freddy. Hi, babe. How you doing? Yeah, good boy. Good boy. Guys hungry? Hungry, huh, huh? Yeah, good boy. Hey, come here, boy. Come here. Come on, boy. Come here. Hey. Who are you? (Horse whinnies) (Suspenseful music) What do you want? (Dramatic music) (Woman screaming) Stop! (Woman screaming) No! (Woman screams) (Dramatic music) (Dog barking) - All right, gentlemen, we're all here for the same purpose. Let's get started. - One minute, stern. In the future, when you send someone to me for money, I don't want him coming to my office. Since Charlie's last visit- - oh, come on, Don. Charlie was a fluke, an accident. - Well, we can't afford to have any more accidents. Look, I've got a position to maintain in this community. So do you, so do all of us. And I'm not going to have my position destroyed by one of your flukes. - Look, Andrews. I'm going to ask you to remember that when you came to us some time ago, you said you'd do anything, absolutely anything, if we could correct the injustice that you had suffered. We took great risk to accomplish that to your satisfaction. - But why do we have to let people like Charlie into this organization? - I agree. No matter how right we know we are, we really stick our necks out. We don't need to hire men like him. - What are we worried about? We hired stern to take care of everything else. He'll take care of this too. - Charlie was a good soldier. Mistakes are made. Now we can be more selective. - Perhaps this would be a good time to add more members to the council. - No, no, I don't think that's a good idea. The more people we bring in, the more people know our operation. - That was our intention when we organized. - When we hired stern, he assured us he could control his men. We didn't expect you to hire psychos. We have no guarantee this won't happen again. - Why don't we give stern a chance to do his job? - Maybe he's not capable. We can't afford mistakes like this! -Are you suggesting replacing him? - If we don't correct this problem now, we may jeopardize everything we've been working for. - None of us can afford to make any mistakes. Charlie will not be a threat to any of us. - I don't like it! - Neither do any of us. Why don't we just let stern handle this matter? - Wells, I promise you that we'll get to Charlie before the police do. - But if- - the discussion is ended. Are we ready? Good. Bring the prisoner in. (Slow drum beat) Philip George willingham. You have been charged here with the crimes of rape and murder. These same charges were made against you in another court of law and dismissed. We're here as a court of appeals to meet our final and just judgment for the benefit of all society. Now gentlemen of the jury, you will note a series of arrest on the accused. (Suspenseful music) Philip George willingham., how do you plead now? - The accused pleads guilty. We have his signed confession. - You verified the information we have? - Our sources have confirmed his identity and his criminal record. (Tense music) - What of the sentence? - Death. As in the past, I've chosen the method that I find the most appropriate. The police will have ample evidence to indicate that his death was a suicide. Get him out of here. Gentlemen, the meeting is over. We have work to do. - I think it's time we allowed Mr. Wells to resign from the council. And I'll take care of Andrews later. (Birds chirping) (Gear shift clicks) (Explosion booming) (People chattering) (Typewriters clacking) (Man sighs) - Damn, I thought we'd have had something by now. - Yeah, vice couldn't come up with a thing. Miss norcross couldn't make any of the mugshots. - What about the sketch? - Nah, too vague. You still having vibrations or Andrews? - I don't know. I sure didn't like him pushing his weight around. - Miss norcross said he always seemed all right to her. - You mean the son of a bitch never made a grab for her ass. - Look, it's getting late. I better get to the funeral, it's in half an hour. - And don't forget, you're going to out there on police business, not monkey business. (Bell tolling) (Solemn music) -Anything I can do? - No thank you. - You going back to work this afternoon? - I have to. I was gonna take the day off, but the boss needs me to come in. - Well, listen, I've got about an hour to kill before I'm due back at the office. Why don't we go get some coffee? -All right. (Light piano music) - You know, we found miss Thompson's car down by the river. Apparently it had run out of gas. - Larry... I've been thinking about what my boss told you. It just doesn't make sense. I mean, when he ran into Charlie the other night, he was in too good a mood for someone who'd just been turned down for a job. - Susan, we went over Andrews' background with a fine-tooth comb. We just came up with a blank. - Something seems strange to me. - Well, why don't we change the subject? Are you originally from St. Louis? -All my life. How about you? - Well, I was born in Dallas, but my folks came up here when I was just a kid. - Do you like it here? - I like my job. - I gotta get back to work soon. - Any new developments on the spear killing? - Yeah, I'm sorry, chief, we're nowhere. We got a few things we're running down. We're pushing a couple of weak leads, but we don't even have a name. - It's a tough one. Anything develops, any leads, keep me posted. - Will do, chief. (People chattering) - Where you been? - Oh, I took her for coffee after the funeral. Sorry I'm late. - How'd it go? - As well as can be expected, I guess. - Well, we have got ourselves another problem. The sheriff of broadwater county called. They found a woman floating in the river, right in the same area where we found the Thompson girl's car. And guess what? She'd been strangled. - Oh no. You know, Susan, she's still not too sure about her boss. - Neither am I. You know, I think we better have another talk with Mr. Andrews. That son of a bitch isn't telling us everything he knows. Come on, let's go. (Solemn music) (Birds chirping) - [Man] She's the enemy, now kill her! (Tense music) Kill them both. Now, Charlie. (Tense music) (Baby crying) (Woman crying) That's the army, Charlie. (Gunshots echoing) (Baby and woman crying) (Explosions booming) You're a good soldier, Charlie. (Bell tolls) - Mr. Andrews? Those two detectives are here to see you. - Show them in. I thought we were through with all of this. - Well, we have a few more questions, we'd like you to answer 'em. We haven't been able to find one single person who remembers seeing this guy before he came into this building. Why do you suppose he picked you of all people to ask for a job? - I'm running ads all the time, looking for salesmen. - Yet he never even called you for an appointment. He walked right in here and you had time to talk to him. - Look, is there something you're trying to tell me? Are you indicating- - no, no, you'rejust one of the few people who have seen this man. We'd appreciate it very much if you'd take the time to come down to the office and go through some mugshots. - I only saw him once, and then for a very short time. Besides, I... There's no way I can get away from the office today. I'll see what I can do for tomorrow. -All right. We'll be in touch. That guy is hiding something. - Hey, listen. Can you keep an eye on him for us? - [Man on phone] Don't worry. These visits are routine. What was that? - I don't know. I'll call you back. (Solemn music) - Have you seen the bloomberg file? - Should be in there. - Oh, Mr. Anders, is something wrong? - No, I just wanted this paper. - Yeah, so what do you think? - I think our friend Mr. Andrews is not too interested in cooperating with us. - What are we doing next? - I say we run Andrews through the newspaper files and see what we can find out there. (Solemn music) (Gunshots banging) - [Man] Charlie, check it out. (Gunshots banging) Don't get too close, use your grenades! (Gunshots banging) (Explosion booming) (Solemn music) - Hi, Joe. You want to have some fun? I'll make you feel good. (Light music) Five dollar. Okay, Charlie. (Tense music) What's the matter? You shy, Charlie? (Tense music) What's the matter, Charlie, you no like me? No like women? (Laughing) (Woman screaming) (Eerie music) (People chattering) - Here's the tear sheets you wanted. We had to go back through three months of files to find these. - Thanks, honey. I owe you one. - Hey Paul, do you suppose Sykes had... Hey Paul? What, you got something? - Hey, listen to this. April 23rd, '78, Columbus, Ohio. "Melissa Andrews, daughter of local businessman Donald Andrews, was found murdered on the campus of Ohio state university. Miss Andrews, 18, a student at Ohio state, was apparently raped and stabbed while walking to her home after evening classes. Lieutenant Robert donaldson told reporters that no suspects had been arrested at this time. Miss Andrews had attended ledu high, was found majoring in speech..." April 24th, '78, Columbus, Ohio. "Police here today announced the arrest of Louis bricker in connection with the murder of Melissa Andrews of St. Louis. Lieutenant Robert donaldson in charge of the investigation told reporters a search of bricker's apartment disclosed certain articles having been identified as belonging to miss Andrews. Bricker, who is currently on parole from Kentucky state penitentiary, will be arraigned on June 2." - Wanna bet? "Murder suspect Louis bricker was released from custody today. Judge William Harper ruled that evidence in the case had been illegally obtained from bricker's apartment. As a result, all charges were dismissed and there are no plans to refile." What do you think about that? - I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. This is dollinger in homicide. Yeah, I want to talk to the homicide bureau in Columbus, Ohio, a lieutenant donaldson. Yeah. Thanks. Well, maybe we finally got something, huh? Oh, hello, lieutenant. Paul dollinger. Oh, just fine, just fine. How are things up in Columbus? Oh, good. Hey, listen. Last April, a St. Louis girl was murdered out of Ohio state university, a Melissa Andrews. Do you remember it? The last info we have in our files is that the charges were dismissed and the suspect was allowed to go free. Anything new come up since then? You're kidding. Yeah, yeah. Hey, well, thank you for your trouble. Yeah, bye. Bye. Yeah, they never did refile the charges against him. He hung himself. - Oh, not another one. - Yup. Detective donaldson said they were surprised as hell. Brecker left a note too, and the coroner ruled it a suicide. - Have you guys come up with anything new on the Sykes case? - Well, captain, we think we may have just gotten something, but we don't know what the hell it is yet. - It seems our friend Andrews had a daughter who was murdered up in Ohio. - So, what the hell does that mean to us? - Well, the police had to let their only suspect go on a technicality. Then they found him again last month. Dead. - Don't tell me another goddamn suicide. - Hung himself. And yes, he left a note too. - Well, if this shit keeps up, we can all go fishing. Say, do you have any idea how Andrews fits into all this? Captain, I'm beginning to get some ideas, but if I went to the da right now, he'd throw me out on my ass. But this son of a bitch Andrews is hiding something from us, that I am sure of. - Well, you better have some evidence. - Say, remember those other suicides the past couple months? - Yeah, but we went over those in detail. We came up empty-handed. - That's right. So let's have the coroner go over those files and see what the hell they can find. (Tapping on window) What have you got for us? - I think you guys are gonna like this one. We found something that may link all seven of your cases together. - Hey, that's great. Who's we? - Dr. Albright himself went over these cases. Come on, I'll show you. - Hi, Paul. - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. - This is my partner, Larry mead. - Larry, pleasure. - Well, Jim's been telling us that you may have found something interesting in these files. - Yes, we've reviewed the case and we do find that as a group, they have something unusual, and that is that the stomach and upper intestinal tract are all empty in these cases. - How do you explain that? - They haven't eaten. - For how long? - Well, as long as several days, possibly. - Foul play? - Well, it's possible, but we can't be sure. - Look, doc, we're talking about seven known criminals, six men and one woman, each of who died in a very similar rundown condition. Now, these deaths could be the result of foul play, now couldn't they? - [Albright] It could be. - Well, at least it gives us something to go on. - I hope so. (Birds chirping) (Tense music) (Woman humming) (Tense music) (Woman humming) (Water running) (Water splashing) (Eerie music) (Tense music) (Can rattles) (Tense music) - Sherry? I'm here with your groceries. (Suspenseful music) Sherry, are you home? (Man shouting) (Gunshot bangs) (Woman screaming) (Siren wailing) - Boys, I pinned my badge on damn near 25 years ago, and I thought I'd seen just about everything. Paul, I'm beginning to pick up some of the same vibrations you had earlier. - Hell, maybe when we catch this Charlie character, he can tie it all together for us. - Hey guys. The sheriff in broadwater county just called again. They think they got your man. He's dead. - Dead? Suicide? - Not this time. Some gal got him with a shotgun in self-defense. Sheriff said he fits the description. A deputy's bringing over some prints. - Now what do we do with all these suicides? - Why don't we just wait for the prints to get here? It may not be the guy we're looking for. - Let's hope. - Let me talk to stern. We've got another problem. - What? They got Charlie? - No, it's my secretary, Susan norcross. I think she was listening to our conversation this morning. - How much do you think she heard? - [Andrews] I don't know. But she's in tight with one of the detectives. She might convince him to look a little closer. -All right. You just keep cool. Don't do anything, we'll take care of things from this end. - Stern, if this isn't handled right, it could blow up in all of our faces. - Every problem has a solution, Andrews. I'll get back to you. Our friend Andrews is beginning to panic. He thinks his secretary might have something on us. - You think we should ease off for a while? - Hell no. I put too much of myself in this to stop now. We've got to prove that we're capable of solving his little problems. Get rid of Susan norcross. - Won't that cause Andrews to pull out? Or maybe even go to the cops? What, and be an accessory to murder? No no. He'll fear the police for being implicated, and he'll fear us even more. - How can we kill the girl without getting the police even more suspicious? - She still lives in the same apartment, right? Well, we'll make it look like Charlie did it. - Okay, thank you, bye bye. Can I help you? - Hi Susan. - Oh, hi Larry. - [Larry] I think we got Charlie. - Oh, thank god. - [Larry] We'll know for sure any minute. We're waiting for a set of prints. Hey, you never gave me an answer about dinner tonight. - Can we make it early? - [Larry] Great, no problem. I promise I'll have you home early. Listen, I have to go. - Okay. - Bye. - Hey Larry. The prints match. Here are the prints. Looks like they got our man. Listen to what came in from Washington. His full name is private Charles Gunther. He served two years in Vietnam. The army gave him a medical discharge to due to battle fatigue. And he escaped from the Illinois state mental hospital over a year ago. - I want you guys to stay on those suicides. Now that this case is ended, you'll have plenty of time. - Thanks a bunch. (Light music) - [Susan] That was the best dinner. - It was a nice dinner, wasn't it? - Company was nice too. - Oh, thank you. And we didn't talk about police business once all evening. - Mm, I forgot to tell you. I listened in on one of my boss's phone calls yesterday, - what'd he have to say? - I didn't hear very much, but some guy was telling Mr. Andrews not to worry. - Did you hear anything else? - I had to hang up. I think Mr. Andrews knew I was listening in. He came out of the office and he was acting guilty and everything and I was scared, so... I didn't have a chance to tell you till now. - You have any idea who he was talking to? - I didn't recognize voice. - Now you're gonna get yourself in trouble if you don't quit playing detective. (Horn honks) Well, I guess I better go meet Paul. - Well, thank you for a nice evening. - Thank you. Good night. - I'll call you tomorrow, okay? - Okay. Buh-bye. (Man breathing heavily) (Dramatic music) (Susan screaming) (Susan mumbling) He's got a knife. - Hey, the guy just went down the back stairs. - Now you wait here. (Engine roaring) (Tires screeching) (Dramatic music) You the driver? - Yeah, but I never saw him. I dunno where he... What happened? - Hey, don't worry, man, I don't think was your fault. - I thought you said it was all over when Charlie was dead. - Thought it was. (Siren wailing) (People chattering) - He hasn't got a thing on him. (People chattering) - [Man on radio] Go ahead. - You're not gonna like this, Paul. This man tried to kill Susan. He was waiting for her in her apartment with a kitchen knife. - It was loaded. - Why the hell use a knife when you got a loaded gun in your pocket? - Paul, did he try to kill the roommate of the girl who was murdered here the other night? Is there any connection between the two incidents? - I don't know yet. - You know who he is? - We get our story, you'll get your story, okay? All right. I want and prints of pictures on my desk the first thing in the morning. - Okay, you got 'em. - Could you tell me a little bit about this phone conversation you overheard yesterday? - Mr. Andrews was talking to another man about your being there. Man told him not to worry. I had to hang up. I think Mr. Andrews knew I was listening in. - You know, I knew Andrews fit in here somewhere. Now if I can just figure out where. Oh, miss norcross... You are going into work again tomorrow, aren't you? - You think that's a good idea? - Well... If Andrews is involved in all of this, it might make him a little suspicious if she doesn't show up. But if he is a part of this, is Susan gonna be safe in that office? - Yeah, but Andrews wouldn't be that stupid to try something in his office. I mean after it all, he's supposed to be a respectable businessman. - Well, I was planning on going anyway, I mean, before all this. Maybe I can dig up some more clues. - No, you just stay out of Andrews' way. - Would you like for me to arrange to have a policewoman sit with you tonight? - Well, I think I can arrange something. (Chattering on police radio) - Yes, that would really work great, uh-huh. Oh, hold the line. - Where's miss norcross? - [Woman] She hasn't come back from lunch yet, sir. - Well, I'm going out for the afternoon. Cancel the rest of my appointments. - Okay, fine. Uh-huh. I've gotta run now. Hey guys, for how much longer do I get this royal escort service? - Oh, it might just be for a long time. - I'm here just to keep him out of trouble. - Hey, I'm late, I gotta get back to work. - Well, remember to keep an eye on Andrews, okay? And I'll call you about five. - Hey Larry, it's my turn tonight, isn't it? - Think you can handle it? - Thanks for lunch. Bye guys. - Buh-bye. - Stern, have you seen the newspaper? - [Stern] Art filled me in, he was there. That's unfortunate. - Unfortunate? What the hell are you doing? He tried to kill my secretary. I'll never get the police out of my hair now. - [Stern] The girl knows too much. We anticipated her death would be blamed on Charlie. - The board didn't give you the right to act as you please, especially when it comes to killing innocent people. I demand that you call a meeting, now. I'm on my way, stern. (Tense music) (Suspenseful music) (Phone ringing) - [Woman on phone] Police department, third district. - Homicide, please. - One moment, please. - [Simms] Homicide, Simms. - Is detective mead in? - [Simms] I'm sorry, ma'am, he's out of service. - How about detective dollinger? - [Simms] They're both out of service. Can I be of some help? - This is Susan norcross. Do you know what time they'll be back? - [Simms] I expect them back any minute. - Okay. Would you tell them that I'm down on the riverfront on wharf street and that I think I might've found something. Tell 'em I'll call 'em as soon as I can, okay? (Tense music) (Eerie music) (Susan screams) (Dramatic music) (Susan screams) - 4428 to base. - [Man on radio] Go ahead, 4428. - 27 and 28 are in service. Do you have anything for us? - [Man on radio] About five minutes ago, Susan norcross called, said she was at wharf St. And would call you again when she could. Said she might've found something, but she didn't say what. - Who the hell does she think she is, Angie Dickinson? - I don't know. She might be in trouble, though. - Yeah, you're right. Let's move. (Siren wailing) Dispatch, this is 4428, can we have backup here to meet us at wharf St. and Washington. - This board simply cannot allow certain individuals to make decisions on their own. - She was a threat to us. I was trying to protect the organization. - But you're talking about killing an innocent girl. Now, this organization was formed to protect the innocent. - This is something new and I are going to have to work out between us. - Susan! - Speak of the devil. This'll make things easier. (Tense music) - What do you mean? What are you going to do with her? - We have no choice. - [Andrews] You're not going to kill her, I won't permit it! - You won't permit it? - That's right. - You won't permit it? I'll tell you what you will permit. That goes for all of you! Sit down, Andrews! Andrews! - Stern, no! (Gunshot bangs) Sit down, you son of a bitch! - Next. (Sirens wailing) Your friends? Then you are worth more to me alive. Mark, check out front. (Tense music) - Oh! - I'll get us a car. (Suspenseful music) (Tires screeching) - Get out! Get outta the goddamn car! (Tires squealing) - Oh! (Siren wailing) Oh. (Susan grunts) (Siren wailing) (Chattering on police radio) - Okay, you guys cover the back.

(Gunshots banging) (Suspenseful music) (Tense music) (Suspenseful music) (Tense music) - Stern? Are we trapped in here? What's happening? Answer me, damn you! (Tense music) - None of you leave this room. (Men grunting) (Gunshot bangs) (Explosions booming) (Tense music) (Siren wailing) (Gunshots banging) Four, you and Terry lay down a field of fire for the choppers coming down. Now, remember what I told you. Keep your head low, keep your butt low, and bust your ass. Go for it. (Solemn music) (Gunshots banging) Four, you and Terry lay down a field of fire. Forward now, 'cause the chopper's coming. We need that cover. Take it now. (Gunshots banging) Chopper comes in. Bust your butts and make it, 'cause that's where you gotta get outta here.
