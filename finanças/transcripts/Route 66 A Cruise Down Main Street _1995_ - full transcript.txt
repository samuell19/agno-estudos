It once started here in the middle of Chicago. They called it Route 66. Today, it doesn't exist on any maps, but to many people, it's still the ribbon that ties America together. A highway of dreams. (country music) I'm on a trip into the past and present. It's eight states, three time zones, and three quarters of a century long. The original Highway 66 spans over 2,200 miles all told. From the Windy City, I'll go through Dwight, Springfield and Mitchell, Illinois before crossing the border into Missouri; then onto St. Louis, Cuba and the Devil's Elbow, and I'll wind up in Kansas at Galena and Baxter Springs. Through the Snowbelt, sunbelt bound. Here we go! This was the first year-round continuous highway, connecting the Midwest to the west, and the gateway to the American dream. Now all that's left of 66 is some remaining stretches of the old route and a whole lot of interstate. I'm here to put the pieces back together; one historic mile at a time, and to meet the people who fought to keep this road alive. It all began as a vision to link two thirds of a nation smitten with wanderlust. By 1926, 800 miles of 66 were paved. Nine years later, a sprawling engineering achievement was complete. Route 66 became a lifeline, connecting the rural towns of the Midwest to urban centers like Chicago. Soon, 66 was a haven for truckers and car crazy Americans.

That's at the quarter of Route 17 and Route 66 in Dwight. - [Hunter] At the Marathon gas station, I met my first 66 regular. Hi there. - Good afternoon. How are you today? - [Hunter] Phil Becker pumped his first tank of gas at the Marathon when he was just 13. 30 years later, he owns it. So what's your competition here? - There used to be a Sinclair station where an Napa store is across the street and there used to be a Amoco station across to the west of us here, but both of those are gone and stuff. We survived. - You got the main corner on 66. - Well, we're one of the last gas stations that are still existing on old 66 that are still running. - [Hunter] Once the very idea of a highway service station was radical. America's come far. The question is; what have we lost along the way?

Now, even old Abe Lincoln would loved the Cozy Dog. It's the home of the original breaded hot dog on a stick on Route 66. - [Hunter] Some of the best kept roadside secrets have been passed down for generations. Bob Waltemeyer holds a secret for that delicacy known as a Cozy Dog. - It's a story that started when my father got the idea out in Oklahoma at a roadside cafe and came up with the idea of impaling the wiener on a stick and then coating it in batter and cooking it. - [Hunter] Bob is a classic 66-er. - I knew that the people were interested in 66 and getting off of the interstate. I didn't realize the phenomenon was going to grow like it has, it's truly a global thing. And I like to think of and say that 66 belongs to the whole world. (light smooth music) - [Hunter] I've come 310 miles. The Mississippi opens the way west and the river's welcome mat is the Chain of Rocks Bridge. It was built in 1929. And once, this was the site of a wildly popular amusement park. Things have calmed down here since then. (smooth jazz music) 66 is more than just blacktop and detours; it's the lifeblood of the land.

(upbeat music) - [Hunter] There are bowlers and then there are living legends. This one has bowled more than 20 official perfect games. Meet Dick Weber. - These lanes here are from the 19 teens, the 20s, the 30s, even some of them are from the 40s, where they have no markings on the lanes whatsoever. - So you're going to help me get coordinated then? - Certainly. (classic rock music) - [Hunter] Before the age of super highways, 66 was lined with bowling alleys. Today, the Bowling Hall of Fame has one of the few remaining alleys where the pins are replaced by hand.

Why do you think people love Route 66? - [Pauline] I don't know, it's nostalgia. - [Hunter] Even on vacation, Pauline can't seem to get away from her connection to 66. - And when I was on this Panama trip, this cruise, and they had the song, "Get Your Kicks on Old 66," and they says, "There she is, Wagon Wheel Motel." - Home sweet home. Good night. (upbeat guitar music) There's nothing like hitting the road after a good night's sleep. They call Missouri the show-me-state, and they've got the billboards to prove it. (jazzy music) Route 66 fueled the evolution of roadside architecture and design. Businesses tried to outdo each other with elaborate enticements, anything to lure motorists. Even gas stations offered landscape lots and uniformed attendance. That's what I call service. - [Radio Host 1] And you're at your Kansas home of country music; KTBK.

Hey, if you're coming up on Baxter Springs, stop by the Gypsy's Tattoo Parlor, that's the place to hear all about the ghostly old spook light. - Evening. I saw your sign out there on spook lights? What's that all about? - The spook light; it's a unexplained ball of light that kind of wonders around south of here, right off of Route 66. - In the woods? - In the woods. (engine revving) - So there I was; driving to the woods with a tattoo artist named Gypsy in search of the infamous spook light that's said to haunt the back roads of 66. I wasn't scared. He's a member of the Chamber of Commerce. Now you said they could be up in the trees, right? - I'd be in the trees. - [Hunter] Okay. - [Gypsy] Could be in the field. - [Hunter] Could be in the field. - [Gypsy] Could be right behind you. (both laughing) - [Hunter] For centuries, back to the time of the Quapaw Indians, people have observed a strange ball of light hovering around here. - [Gypsy] But he'll come out; he always does. (soft guitar music) - [Hunter] They claim it's the ghost of a love stricken miner in search of his runaway bride. Me, I just chalk it up to the spirits of 66. Having had no luck spotting the spook light, I headed out of town to Oklahoma. (soft music) Oklahoma. OK. Woody Guthrie, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, Ma Barker; they knew how to travel in style. This is road heaven, with more miles of 66 than in any state. There are 400 miles here, all told, through towns like Afton, Foyil, Sapulpa and Clinton.

And as you're cruising down Route 66, be sure and take a turn into Darryl Starbird's Rod and Custom Car Hall of Fame. - [Hunter] What would 66 be without four wheels and eight cylinders? This is the place where the car was king and the hot rod ruled supreme. Just ask auto enthusiast, Darryl Starbird. - This is kind of a typical all American hot rod. Much like they used in the Route 66 movie, or TV series I guess actually. - Now speed and good looking cars kind of go hand in hand with Route 66, don't they? - Right, and that's kind of what this whole thing is about. Beautiful cars, speed, high powerful engines. - Lots of noise. - Restyled hot rods. Lots of noise. - Let people know you're coming. (classic rock music) In 1920, there were only 6.5 million cars on the road. By 1956, there were over 65 million. To postwar baby boomers, a set of wheels was an invitation to a lifestyle that we've never outgrown. On Route 66, America and the car came of age. - [Radio Host] Covering the Heartland 24 hours a day with quality Bible teaching and Christian information your family can depend on. Galloway's Totem Pole Park in Foyil, Oklahoma; the world's largest totem pole. (smooth jazz music) - [Hunter] The world's largest totem pole.

(smooth jazz music continues) - [Mike] AM 1050 KGTO. Hi, it's Mike McCarthy as we cruise down to Route 66, a cruise down main street into Norma's Cafe. Norma's been serving the same menu in Route 66 since the 50s; everything is made from scratch. - What was it like when you first opened up? - Oh, we were busy, busy, busy back then in the old day. And as a matter of fact, we were open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Didn't even have a lock on the door. - Oh, isn't that nice? - We just didn't close. - [Hunter] During the heyday of Route 66, Norma herself cooked a dozen pies a day. Today, Norma still cooks up 24 different kinds of pie. So, do you make the pies fresh? - Yes, I make pies every day and we do not sell day old pie as a general rule. We sell all of our pie every day. I don't make a huge amount of pies, I make what we need for each day, and that way they're good and fresh. And I find that people like them better that way. - Yeah. (slow jazzy music) Oklahoma hospitality was born of hard times. In the 30s, dust choked the life out of these parts. More than 200,000 people fled for California in search of better days. Route 66 was their road of opportunity. (soft guitar music) Today, the dust has settled. But the Okies will always live on. In the "Grapes of Wrath," John Steinbeck called them the people in flight from the terror behind. Strange things happen to them. Some bitterly cruel and some so beautiful that the faith is re-fired forever. - [Radio Host 1] KATT FM Oklahoma City. - [Radio Host 2] If you're traveling Route 66 through Clinton, Oklahoma, enjoy a game of miniature golf at McLean Rogers Park on Old Route 66 in Clinton. As always, take along KCLI, oldies 107. - Today I have a rendezvous with a real Route 66 fixture. The woman who ran every kind of business along the old road. I better win this. Oh! - Ready? - You and me. Hello, Gladys Glancy. All right, so shall we let the games begin? This is almost like taking a drive down 66, isn't it? - Yeah. All the way. - Kansas. I think this is my lucky state. - Did it go in? - No. - No. I'm back behind it. - Oh my, you got it! (both laughing) (banjo music) No hands. - Is that cheating? (banjo music continues) (Hunter cheers) (banjo music continues) You whooped me. Should we count it up? - Tell you what, let's tie. - Let's tie? - Yeah. - Okay. I like that. That's good. For Gladys, Route 66 is more than a highway; it's the road of her life. So long, Gladys, I'm Texas bound. (golf ball clattering) There's good reason they call it the Texas panhandle. It's hot and flat and long. There was a time when 66 ran 180 miles straight across this stretch of endless earth. My first stop is the sleepy town of McLean. Then the leaning water tower of Groom. A sip at the Adrian Cafe before I turn cowgirl. (jazzy piano music) At the Devil's Rope Museum in McLean, Old 66 is alive and well thanks to collector Delbert True. What do we got here? - Well, this is our typical greasy spoon cafe that we've tried to show- - Saddle up to the bar. - Yes, well, you just sit down and you scoot it up and straddle the stool. And you looked at the ugly cook and you looked at the menu. - [Hunter] Look at those prices. - One fourth fried chicken for .90 cents. And then when you ordered it, the old brassy waitress says, "Run that chicken across the fire twice," or- - Other wise, meaning well done. - Yeah. Burn this steak or leave it a-bellowing. So they always had a snappy comeback and it was quite a treat to order in a greasy spoon Route 66 cafe. - [Radio Host] This ain't no jukebox. The most fun. ♪ Get your kicks ♪ ♪ Amarillo ♪ - The panhandle is flat and clear, and except for those crickets on AM radio, it's quiet as can be. With Adrian, the midpoint of my trip, it's a mighty good time to slow down. At the Adrian Cafe, they say you get your sips on Route 66. (smooth jazzy piano music) Well, I could fancy a cup of coffee right about now and a big helping of hospitality. And I hear a real gentleman, 88 year old Lauren Critz, has some time on his hands and many a tale to tell about that old mother road. (bell rings) This the Adrian Cafe? - Sure is. - Well, I heard I was supposed to come here and hear some great stories about Old Route 66. - Well, is that so? - You know any stories about Route 66 you can share with me? - Oh, I guess. I sure know a lot of them. My first experience, and only experience going to California, they had a boardwalk across the desert out there. A boardwalk. You don't know what a boardwalk is. - I do. - You do? - Sure. - Timbers. - Yeah. - And every so often you'd come to a place where you could pass. - When you go got your first car, what was it like driving around on Old 66? - Well, when we got our first car, we didn't have a paved road or a dirt road even, a grated road; it was just driving across the prairie. We just come across pastures. - By 1938, all of 66 was paved. For Texas, this meant crops, cattle and oil could hit the road as well as the rails. Trucking went into high gear and with rain from above and that hard top below, the region put the Dust Bowl in the rear view mirror. John Steinbeck once called 66 the mother road. Here in the panhandle, at the halfway mark, I can really sense how much this road created, how much it nourished the people in these places in its heyday. For a time, I think this was one very nurturing mother. (harmonica music) Before leaving Texas, I promised myself a view of 66 from tall in the saddle. And who better to show me the ropes than the fellow who manages more than 40,000 acres of ranch land in Texas, Butch Boydston. So where does Route 66 run out here? - Well, it comes off the cap rock right over there where you can see those vehicles. That's the interstate 40 now and the original Old Route 66 come off to the left and come right down in front of us and just blow the cap rock here. - [Hunter] When Route 66 was very young, there were more horses in Texas than cars. Some say those were better days. As for me, I've got 1,200 miles to go. I think I'll take the car and head to New Mexico. (harmonica music continues) - [Radio Host] Ladies and gentlemen, you're listen to Cool 102 FM, oldies radio for New Mexico. - [Hunter] Old Route 66 helped many quintessential American concepts catch fire. Like the motel; that uniquely American home away from home. New Mexico; from Tucumcari, the motel town, to the Spanish influences of Albuquerque, to the roots of Native American culture in Gallup, this state is its nickname; a land of enchantment. - [Radio Host] You're listening to KTNM 1400, Tucumcari, New Mexico. - [Hunter] In 1961, the number of US motels hit an all time high. 61,000. Tucumcari is one reason why. It's known as the town of 2,000 motel rooms, and I'm on a mission to find the perfect one. (salsa music) There are still 29 legendary motels on Tucumcari's Vegas style neon strip. Prices range from $18 to $70, and of course the carpeting ranges from industrial to shag. So take your pick. Mine's the 1948 Blue Swallow and have yourself the sweetest dreams. (Spanish guitar strumming) Out of the original 350 miles of Old 66 in New Mexico, much of it is still drivable. My next stop is the small town of Barton, just east of Albuquerque. There's a man there who collects classic 66 memorabilia. They say he's a classic himself; having broken nearly every bone in his body as a young iron worker. His name's Bob Odette. - Hi. - Couldn't help but stopping. - Yeah. - You sure do have a collection of stuff. - I've been working at it. - So California or bust, huh? - Oh yeah. Route 66. - What do we got over here? Route 66. So these are the old Bonnie and Clyde cars. - [Bob] That one is. - This one working? - That one runs good. - How about you take me for a spin? - I was just checking the gas leak. - Oh yeah? A gas leak? - Little bit. Not too bad. - [Hunter] You don't smoke, do you? - [Bob] Nope. - [Hunter] So let's see if she'll start. (door thuds) (engine rumbling) - Warmed up. - California bound. Ope, wrong way. - Get your kicks on Route 66. ♪ Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino ♪ (mysterious flute music) - It's hard to imagine this place as it was; the homeland of many generations of Native Americans. From the ancient Anasazi to the Pueblo of today. Trading posts along 66 brought commerce to these communities with hoards of tourists looking for trinkets. (mysterious flute music continues) The Native American presence has still strongly felt as you travel through this landscape. More than a trip through our recent past, here, the old road takes us back even further through century upon century. (light upbeat music) Before leaving New Mexico, I want to make one last stop. A few miles down the road near Gallup is Fort Yellow Horse, a trading post that dates back to the 1920s. While Native Americans couldn't own their own businesses until the 1950s, today Chief Juan Yellow Horse runs the show here. He's actually been selling goods on 66 since he was a small boy in the 1930s. Hi there. - Hi. - I saw your light on. - Good. I'm glad you stopped. - I've been driving on Route 66 and I'm heading on my way to Arizona. - You're almost there, right there, you're at the last place in New Mexico here. Chief Yellow Horse's. - Take one step in. - One step and you're here. - We're here in Arizona. (both laughing) So this is a traditional trading post? - Yes, ma'am, this is a traditional trading post. These is are some rugs that we make, us Navajos, we make these type of rugs. This is jewelry that we make. - [Hunter] It's late, but Chief Yellow Horse invited me for a walk in his backyard. Legend has it that Geronimo came right here to ask the Navajo to join him in battle against the United States. Many such ruins and much of old Route 66 lie on private property today. So look closely; backyards across the west can hold many ancient secrets. - Back in about 900 up to 1100, the Anasazi Indians, they came in here and they built their villages and that's some of the ruins up there on the wall. (Spanish guitar music) - [Hunter] I've already set foot in Arizona, and yet there are miles to go before I sleep in the Grand Canyon state. (swinging harmonica music) Here it is, Arizona. And here I am tracing Arizona's 386 miles of Route 66 from the Painted Desert's kaleidoscopic hills to Holbrook's concrete wigwams, from two stepping in Flagstaff to a trim in Seligman, and the open road of Oatman and Topack. - [Radio Host] Some lead, others follow. And we don't know how to follow. You're getting your country kicks on Route 66 with Super Country. - Route 66 runs right by the Petrified Forest National Park and right by that 170 million year old forest is the famous Painted Desert. Here, the golden sands and soils and the red rocks of the west are tinted purple, rose, chocolate and blue. And as the hours and seasons change, so do the colors of this landscape. It simply takes your breath away. Next stop, the town of Holbrook. Have you slept in a wigwam lately? Well, not me. So this is the place to rest those weary bones western style. This wigwam village is one of the old road's most memorable landmarks. They opened their flaps for business back in 1950. There are 15 concrete wigwams and all with double beds, full bath and air conditioning. The tents may be cement, but I can assure you, the beds are genuine dream catchers. Great. My own little wigwam. Enough resting. Flagstaff in the Arizona nightlife beckon. ♪ Colt 107.5 ♪ - [Radio Host] Colt Country 107.5 invites you in your crew to the best happy hour in Flagstaff only at the world famous Museum Club on historic Route 66. (pool balls clattering) - The Museum Club was created in 1931 to house freakish taxidermied animals, but it soon became a hopping roadhouse. - Would you like to dance? - I'd love to. You have to teach me a step. - This is called the two step. - Two step? - Yeah. - The Ponderosa Pines the club was built around became part of the dance floor. My partner, Dave McLaughlin, says he started dancing when he was four years old. Didn't know I could dance. The club says country western greats like Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings crooned here before they hit the big time. (jazzy music) - [Singer] Y'all come on and dance with me.

I'm from Florida. - From Florida. - But I'm driving all the way from Chicago on old Route 66. - Oh my gosh, on Route 66? - Yep. It's been a great thing for me to discover because it really is going into a very special part of America and when you get on the big roads you just don't get the same feeling. - Well, it's our heritage. Route 66 is our heritage. On that highway right there, people had a dream. If we can just get to California, we're all going to be better off. But now that my wife and I have raised four children and we almost, the Delgadillo family almost joined the Grapes of Wrath back in the late 30s. How hard it was. It was America having a hard time then. It was very rough. In the winter time, they may have ran out of gas, they were cold, the cars didn't have the heaters of today, refrigeration of today and it was just different. - By the time World War II hit, the Okie migration gave way to America's war machines. The route and the region around it became training bases and even POW camps. Old 66 helped pull off the greatest mobilization of troops in US history. Driving west from Seligman on the longest stretch of uninterrupted Old 66, I think how wide open spaces and open arms go hand in hand out here. Route 66 is a real community. Everywhere you go you make friends, and you know what? In Oatman, Arizona, even the animals are friendly. (campy piano music) (Hunter laughing) Bye, everybody. So long, Arizona. On to the 315 marvelous miles of California. (soft fiddle music) How many roads save their best for last? 315 marvelous miles of pure California. But before I head through the desert and set my sights on Hollywood, I make a slight detour off 66 onto I-40 to take a ride on the Colorado River along the California border. A canoe ride with Ernie Doyren. He runs a nearby canoeing service. And even a river ride leads you home to 66. So this is the Old Route 66 bridge? - Yes, this was the first major construction in California after the Route 66 crossed the Colorado river. - [Hunter] What's it made out of? - It's Navajo red sandstone and probably quarried on a Kaibab Plateau north of Grand Canyon because we have no rock quarries here. - It's a beautiful condition, isn't it? - Yes, it's probably 50 years since anybody's maintained anything on it. - Let's go take a look underneath. (soft guitar music) Now, Ernie wants to show me one more place before I hit the road again. So this supposedly is the place where Steinbeck finished up the "Grapes of Wrath." - People that lived here said that he probably wrote the last two or three chapters of the book while he was staying in one of these cabins. - Little did they know what they were getting into in California, did they? - No. 100 miles of desert did a lot of people in before they got there. (engine rumbling) (country music) - Hitting the road, I head for Needles, the country's hottest city in the Mojave Desert, to tiny Essex where I bolt the desert road and spring through Newberry Springs, all the way to Santa Monica and Ocean Avenue. ♪ Roadside motor court ♪ ♪ Cabins made of sandstone ♪ ♪ Traveling in style ♪ ♪ Was a port in the storm ♪ Ironically, Route 66 was largely responsible for its own demise. The road was so popular that the public clambered for more. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 would revolutionize the nation's highways and blast 66 into the past. In the sun baked town of Needles, one of the Mojave's oldest, the temperature's rising. Here in the 1920s before the era of motels, the Cardi Camp was a bustling overnight stop where cars pulled in, families pitched tents, then loaded up on gas and supplies for the toughest leg of the trip, crossing the parched desert. (melancholy piano music) For the Okies, Steinbeck called this bleak flatlands "the Path of a People in Flight." They all sought the land of milk and honey, but some never even made it across the Mojave. The city of angels for them remained forever only a vision, fleeting. There's a place where every road ends, but some stretch on long after their black top stops. 66 goes on forever.
