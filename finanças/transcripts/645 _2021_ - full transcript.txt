Yeah, it's nice and quaint. It is. Where are the people again? I don't know. Why don't we find out? Hello, Bog Grove, grove, grove. Repeat after me. Repeat. You do it. Hello, Bog Grove. You're my kryptonite. - Just ask my parents. - Mm hm. Well, that's why your mom hates me. But I am reformed, remember? - Mm, that's what you say. - Mm hm. Look. Look at how beautiful this is. Isn't it amazing? What do you think? It looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting. It's cool. I'm telling you we're gonna have a magical weekend. Okay? I promise. Come here. Hello? Hello? Huh, again, where is everybody? Hello? - Knock, knock. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Again, where are all the people? I don't know. Hello? Oh, incoming! I think that's a new record. Gotta keep the talons tame. - Hello. - Blue eyes, red hair. Third wife, I liked her. Hope he's not the chef. Oh, I happen to do that too. I'm Gene. Welcome to the Cozy Nook. - Huh? - I'm Bobby. This is my girlfriend, Jules. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I'll let you in on a little secret. - Okay. - Most folks say after spending one day in Bog Grove, they just can't leave. Huh? I gotta get back to a recording session on Monday. Sorry, so, let's just play it by ear. Or we can always just take a ferry home in the morning if we need to. No ferry service tomorrow. Okay. Oh, that's confusing. Why not? Is it because there's a holiday or something? You might say that. Just that there's a little history on the island, that's all. Don't worry. You kids are gonna have a great day. Look at this. - All right, this way. - All right. A beautiful lighting table here, kitchenette, there's your bathroom, your beautiful bedroom, ceiling fans in both rooms. And now, for the Pierre Cardin de la resistance, a beautiful view of the island. Complete with your own private balcony. - Huh? - Nice, I love it. It's a good nookie vibe in here, huh? Enjoy yourselves, kids. - Thanks, Gene. - Welcome. - Check this out. - Look at this view. Wow. Look at this. Okay, does any of this look familiar to you? No, I don't remember any of it. I was so young. If you told me we were going on vacation a couple weeks ago, I would have told you you were crazy. There's nothing wrong with going a little crazy once in a while. Yeah, I just hate when we fight. Yeah, well, all couples fight. Hey, I love you. I love you. It's Gene. Everything okay in there? Uh, Gene, yeah, we're good, buddy. Thank you. These walls are really, really thin. He's probably got his ear against the door right now. Hm, he's probably outside there clipping his fingernails. Is he? Oh, yeah. Ooh, I like makeup sex. Yeah. - You gotta be kidding me. - Hm? Who set the alarm for 6:45? Calm down, ray of sunshine. You must've done it outta habit. That's not me. That thing is from the '70s. I don't know how to work it. Well, I'm awake now. Yeah, it's really beautiful. Huh, why don't we get out there and explore. Soak up the local culture. Bog Grove culture? Absolutely. I'm just kidding. Of course. Hey, I love you. Anything you want, we're in, I'm game. You really love me, huh? I know you may not believe this, but you're the only girl I've ever loved. Hm, you're right. I don't believe you. Hey, look, I've used those words before, but I never meant it. With you it's different. I'd never hurt you. You know that, right? Interesting. - What about Ashley? - That, no. We promised not to talk about that while we're here, okay? I already know, I just needed to hear you say it. Why? Because it's important. Jesus Christ. It's Gene. Everything all right in there? Uh, yeah, Gene, thanks. Everything's great. Why did, how are his toenails? What is this guy doing? Don't want your breakfast to get cold. Thanks, buddy. Wow, they're on it here, huh? It's like he left. It's like he never left the door. Hey, you think I can smoke in here? I doubt it. What's this, "To Bobby?" I wrote you a letter. When'd you do that? When we were fighting. In case I forgot all the terrible, terrible things I wanted to say to you. That sounds great. Why don't you go shower and we'll read it together later for a laugh. Okay. Well, can you do me a favor? Burn that letter. Ha, ha, ha. Tell your mom I said hi. Hey, Gene. - Hey, good morning. - Hey, good morning. I just noticed the bathroom this morning and I wanted to mention it. It's pretty messy right now. Oh, sorry about that. I'll have Shelly tidy up in there later. Don't you guys usually tidy up before people arrive? Well, sometimes Shelly gets the numbers mixed up. Not a problem, I'll have her take care of it. - Okay. - You two were up kinda early. Most couples like to sleep in a little late on their vacation. Um, why is it so dead around here? Isn't this supposed to be like the perfect winter getaway? It is, but not this weekend. I'm surprised there's anyone here at all. Yeah, what's up with that? Well, something... Gene, come on. What is, what's, what are you not saying obviously what happened here? Oh, it was bad things. Very bad things. Let's just leave it at that. Look, forget I said anything. Forget it. I mean, what's past is the past. Nobody can change that. Most important thing for you is to make sure you make wonderful, beautiful memories on our island. Take some pictures, take 'em home and make a scrapbook. That's some great advice. I appreciate that, Gene. Yeah. Oh, look at that. You missed one right there. Hm. What? Thanks, Gene. What do you think he was talking about? I don't know. I think the whole thing's promotional. Oh, really, promotional? Yeah, he tells us a scary story, we tell somebody else a scary story and so forth and so on, and business is booming. Wait, why would he do that? I don't understand. I don't know, tourism is down. Bog Grove ain't quite the tourism mecca. What do you think? Look at it. If this story grows, he might get like a ghost hunting show that comes here and then you got 1,000 asshats with selfie sticks. Boom, business is booming. - You think? - Yeah. You know what, I bet we could leave here and get a t-shirt that says, "I survived Bog Grove." Anyway, you ready to get out there? Let's go. Here. - Nice. - Oh, look at that, babe. Yeah. Hey, babe, it says "Jules." Nice. Ooh, nice. Whoopi Goldberg, "Ghost." Demi Moore. Nailed it. "16 Candles." "Ghost Rider." Grandma? Wow, what's this? "Free historical movies every 10 minutes." What do you think, you wanna check it out? - Heck yeah. - Okay. Okay, even I'm bored by this. Oh, thank god you said that. All right, I'm game. Hm. Well, that was interesting. So strange. I remember coming here. I used to hang out and play "Donkey Kong" all the time. "Donkey Kong." Wanna try one out? - Yeah. - This is the one right here. - Oh, great. - Yeah, here it is. You play pinball? Couple times. This is the game that my dad and I used to play when he had a few extra quarters coming off a bender or whatever. Come on, let's go. Hey, easy, easy, tiger. You break it, I buy it. Calm down, hey, hey, hey! Really? Really. We're just having fun, right? So, let's just have fun. Take it easy. Did you ever live on an island like this? Heck no. I wanted to, when I was little especially. Yeah, "Robinson Crusoe." You're such the romantic. I love you. You know that's gonna wash away in like no time. Nothing lasts forever. Fuckin' starving. This it? - How you livin', all right? - Yeah, good. We are livin' the dream. The dream is real. - Oh, hey. - Okay, guys. - Ah, yes. - And if you need anything else let me know, my name is Pearl. - Thank you, Pearl. - Thanks, Pearl. Yeah. How you guys doing over here? You want a beer with those burgers? - We're fine. - We'll take a water. Water's good. Why are you in a fucking bar if you're not gonna have a drink? Shut the hell up would you, Brooklyn? My name's Larry. They call me Legosh. I have no idea why, but if you guys need anything, if I can do anything to help you, you let me know. Appreciate it, man. Yeah. You guys sure you're okay? I'm totally fine, man. Just an unexpected early morning. - That's all. - Hey, girl. Why don't you ditch the stick and go with the chick? It's a first time for that one. Brooklyn, did you swallow a book of poetry? What's up, where do you wanna go after this? It's just this guy in the booth is just, is just like staring at me. You're a good looking girl, you get stared at all the time. He's kinda freaking me out a little bit, that's all. Yo,. You got a problem, dude? Okay. I give you new and improved Bobby Patterson. Bobby, stop! You think it's cool looking at my girl? Fuckin' smack that off your face. Mm, and without a punch thrown. My hero. I know, totally boring. I hope she dumps your ass. Okay. I love that idea, I love exploring. Okay. What do you want? What's wrong? Oh, nothing. I was just thinking about the story my mom told about this couple traveling to Colorado. Mm hm. I guess they got killed by a bunch of locals. When did she tell you that? This morning when I called her. - Oh, you got through? - Yeah, barely. My phone died halfway through. - Ah. - No more phone. Why's she gotta be so morbid? I guess that's just her way of saying be careful. Well, she has a point. Marry me, Jules. - What? - Yeah. - But we were just fighting. - Yeah, I know, I know. It... It took me almost losing you to realize how much I love you. And I know this isn't ideal, but I don't know what that means. I wanna prove to you that I can be the man that you deserve. I love you. What? - I love you. - I love you. What? Would you like to head back? Um, no, let's keep walking. - Yeah? - Yeah, it's a beautiful day. - Okay. - Yeah. I wish this day could last forever. Oh, my God, you gotta be kidding me. Calm down, ray of sunshine. You must've done it outta habit. What time is it? It's 6:45. Holy shit, I had the weirdest dream. Oh, what was it? It was... You know what? Don't worry about it. You just go to bed, okay? What was it, what was your dream? I'll tell you what it means. It's Gene. Everything okay in there? Yeah, everything's fine in here, Gene. Thank you. What does he think we're doing in here? It's like he never left the door. Yeah. Hey, I don't think you can smoke in here. Oh, yeah, that's right, um... Oh, yeah, I wrote you a letter. Hey, why don't you go shower. I'm gonna call my mom to see if I can get through to her. Let her know I'm alive. Should I tell her you said hi? Okay. And then, strike three. Morning. Hey, sorry about the bathroom. I'll have Shelly tidy up in there later. The two of you are up early. Most folks like to sleep in late, huh? Yeah. Why is it so quiet around here, Gene? Well... Something happened on the island a few years ago. Now, I don't wanna get you all in a tizzy, but a couple visiting Bog Grove were Killed over by the cathedral. - Over by the cathedral. - Oh, my God. Killed? The girl's throat was slashed. Her fella's neck snapped like a twig. Well, do they, do they know who did it? No. They never caught the guy. Cops never found any evidence at the scene. No DNA, no prints, nothing. Outta respect for the families, the town decided no ferry service on the anniversary of their death. Hm. God, a terrible, terrible tragedy. Anyway, you two have fun out there, all right? Oh, look at that. You think I look British? Hey, babe, it says Jules. "16 Candles." "Baywatch." "Demi Moore." "Soundgarden." Oh, woo! Yeah! You okay? I feel like I'm having like serious, serious deja vu. Well, you were here as a kid, so maybe that's why. No, I mean, I mean the whole day. Like everything you say and like everything that I do is, we've already said it and we've done it already before. Stop messing with me. Come on. No, I, I mean it. It feels like a dream. Like I'm watching us, you know? Okay, if that's true, then what happens to us? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you're okay. Hey, listen to me. Let's go get some air, okay? Okay, guys, here you go. And if you need anything else let me know. - My name is Pearl. - Thank you. Hey, can we go some place else to eat? Okay, but Gene said this place was great, so let's just stay here. I don't, I don't care about his Yelp review. I really don't. - Can we just- - Baby, we're already here. Well, let's go some place different. Let's try something new, right? Okay, because we come to Bog Grove every weekend. No, I mean, let's go to a different town, all right? A different hotel, try something new- Hey, hey, listen, listen. You just, you had a bad dream or whatever it was. You're fine, okay? We're fine, I promise. And listen, we don't come here often, so let's just enjoy it while we're here. What do you say? Why are you in a fucking bar if you're not gonna drink? Shut the hell up, Brooklyn. You're just a bartender, Larry. Know your fucking place. Brooklyn has a few drinks in her and she gets carried away. Pay no attention to her whatsoever. No, she's fine, she's fine. Hey, girl, hey, hey. Why don't you ditch the stick and get with a chick? First time for that one. Larry, can I just, can we get the check real quick, man? You got it. I hope she dumps your ass. Hey, there's this guy in the booth and he's just like staring at me. Hey, stop, what are you doing? - What? - Stop it. - What? - Hey, what are you gonna do, just punch a guy in the face 'cause he's looking at me? How many times are we gonna do this? Seriously? - That's a good question. - Hey. Hey, where the hell are you going, huh? Stop! What? Are you kidding me? Hey! What the fuck? What the fuck? Jules, I know you don't believe me, but I really was protecting you. - Slow down. - From what? I don't know. Okay. Well, at least you took me for a walk, so thank you. Yeah, well, on a different route anyway. Where do you mean different route? What, what, what do you mean? Just forget it, okay? As long as you and I are cool, I'm good. Okay, well. - Okay? - Yeah. - All right. - Thank you for taking me here. Come on, you're super beautiful. - You are beautiful. - I am? Yeah. Oh, I'm so sorry. Fuck. No, no, no, no. No, not again. Calm down, ray of sunshine. Whoa! Don't fucking say that. Please don't fucking say that. Please, please, please, please. All I was gonna say was- Calm down, ray of sunshine, you must've done it outta habit. Bingo. Okay, look at us. No, no, no, don't look at us. Do you know that you've said that to me three times? Three fucking times. Third time for what? - You're scaring me. - Oh, yeah, you're scared? It's Gene, everything all right in there? Right on cue. Yeah, everything's fine in here, Gene. Sorry. Everything's not fine, Gene. How about you fuck off. Bobby, third time for what? We've done this twice before, and this is the third time we've done this. Every morning we wake up at 6:45 in the a.m., and we say the same shit. We do the same shit. And then we go about our day and then... And then what? Then something happens to you. What happens to me? I don't wanna talk about it. You had a bad dream, that's all. Okay, yeah, bad dream. That's what it is. Okay, you had, you had a terrible dream. That's a better word. Yep. Yeah, but let's be realistic here. All right, this could be from anything. You've been stressed out lately. We've been fighting. You have no idea, okay? Everything it feels so. You're gonna be okay. How many times have you woken up from a dream sad or happy or scared? Right, right? You got me, Jules. How many fuckin' times? Why don't you just calm down and we'll go get some fresh air. Okay? - Just go shower. - Mm hm. I'm gonna call my mom and let her know I'm alive. Should I tell her you said hi? Yeah, sure. Okay. What the fuck? Okay. Okay. Oh, hey, morning. Sorry about the bathroom. I'll have Shelly tidy up in there later. Will you? Yeah, where is Shelly? Is she sleeping in? No, she's here, she's working. Okay, now that I got you here in front of us instead of knocking on our door which you love to do, we pay good money, right, right? Can I assume that I'm not gonna have to shave the fuckin' soap tomorrow? - Bobby. - Shave the soap? What are you talkin' about shaving the soap? There was a hair on it this big. - Really? - Yeah. Well, I'll have Shelly take care of it. That sounds great. This Shelly person, who is she? I've not seen her. - Have you seen her? - Stop it, stop it. Hm, yeah? Gene, not having a very good time as you can see. I assume the ferries are running so we can get the fuck outta here? Bobby, Bobby, how many times I gotta tell you there's no ferry service this weekend. You can't get off the island, all right? But I will get Shelly for you. She's down in the laundry room. We'll take care of the bathroom. - She is? - Yeah. Okay, great. That sounds awesome. Thanks, Gene. - You're welcome. - What? You know, this stopped being fun about an hour ago. Mm mm, this stopped being fun yesterday when I did it for the second time. I told you that. Why are you being such an asshole? Hey, I'm trying to save you. - That's all. - Save me from what, Bobby? I am fine. Everything is fine. I don't know what you think happened to me. Honestly, I have no idea. Okay. His is gonna sound fuckin' crazy, I know. But you... Bobby, what? Forgot something, I'll be right back okay? - Are you serious? - I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. - I'll be right back. - Don't touch me. I apologize, my bad. Hey, Shelly. Don't worry, I'm gonna get the bathroom cleaned for you right now. Look at that, who's the lucky guy? Give me a break. What do you want? I've got a question to ask. I got a lotta rooms to do. What is it? Gene was talking about a story, a couple that got murdered a while back. What happened, who were they? Lovers on vacation as far as I know. Sally, there is a hair on this soap! You know what you need to do, Bobby. How do you know my name? Just do the right thing. It's all you gotta do. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the hell does that mean? Don't touch me. Hey, what the hell does that mean? Don't touch me. - Have you been drinking? - What? Is that, are you serious? - Come on. - Well, you're looking around like a crazy maniac. - Thank you. - Oh, thanks. No way. Marry me, Jules. We were just fighting. I don't understand, what, how? None of that matters. I love you so much. I love you. I am right here, Jules, the whole time okay? Hey. I know just how good the odds are that this is gonna go bad. Jules is different, Cassi, I'm serious. Uh, she may be different, but you? Mm mm, nope. She doesn't even know who you are. - Yeah? - Not really. How long have we known each other, huh? I think the heart wants what the heart wants. - You didn't just say that. - Yes, I did. Don't even try that Dr. Phil crap with me. Like... She's wrong for you. She's a nice girl, but a dog's gotta hunt. And we both know, Bobby Patterson was, is, and will always be a pure bred canine. What's the one that was up here from Florida? - With the internship. - Yeah are, yeah, okay. - That was Alexi and I was- - And? Just welcoming her to our city. You were just welcoming her to fuck you for a few months. And the waitress in Tribeca? That was, that was Sarah. Soup, the girl smelled like soup. Delicious soup. You starting to see where I'm going with this? - Maybe a little. - Yeah, yeah. Listen to Cassi, she's nothing but classy. - You are. - This is true. You've always had my back, I know that. It's about being true to yourself. That is some Dr. Phil shit right there. You know what? - Fuck you, Bobby. - Fuck you? And that ship sailed a long time ago. - Very long ago. - Nice try. Very,. I wish this day could last forever. That's really what you wanna do? Why not? You wanna stay in the room all day? Are you kidding me? Who wouldn't wanna spend all day in a room with you? Cute, you're cute. Mm hm. Hm, I don't know, let's think about it. How often do we get to spend all day in a cozy bed in this cozy nook, giving massages and making love all day. - I don't know. - Yeah? Okay, but shouldn't we, I don't know. Go sightseeing or something? Oh, I've got my sights right here. That's a good one. That was bad I think, oh yes. It's Gene. Gene, yeah, we're good in here, buddy. Everything all right in there? Yeah, yeah. What is he doing? Hey, Gene, yeah, we're fine. I think we're gonna stay in today. - You are? - Yeah. Would you mind bringing up some lunch and maybe some of those board games you mentioned? Since you asked so politely. So, I asked Gene to bring up some lunch and board games for us. What do you think? Hm? - Keep going. - Keep going? - Mm hm. - Okay. - I'll keep going. - Mm hm. Oh, my God, Bobby. Not so rough, sheesh. Sorry. Hey, I love you. I love you. Oh, that was a quick one. - Mm. - Okay, teach me how to play. - Okay. - What's my first move? - This- - Uh huh, is? - This is a pawn. - Is a pawn. Mm hm, it's a very important piece. "The black cat. For the most yet wildly homely narrative which I'm about to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief in which case where my senses reject their own evidence. Mad I am not, very surely do I not dream. Before I die, today I would unburthen my soul. Would unburthen my soul my immediate purpose." Hey, baby. Hey. I really love this day. I wish it could last forever. Jesus Christ. What's up? I'm gonna take these dishes outside for Gene. Well, just put 'em in the sink right there. Then it's gonna stink all night and that would suck. - Right? - Okay. Why don't you just leave 'em? Open the door and just pop 'em right on the floor for Gene, and he'll pick 'em up. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Okay. What? I just, that's what I'm doing, baby. - Okay. - Yeah. Hey, Gene. Thanks! A real son of a bitch! I think I pissed him off. - Oh, yeah? - 100% pissed him off. - 100%? - Yes. Hey, I'm gonna shower. - Okay. - Yeah. - Can I join you? - No, you stay right here. I got you right where I want you. - Oh, really? - Yep, yep. - I'm showering. - Well, that's interesting. - You are? - Mm hm. Huh, okay. You can sleep on that bed out there, all right? Okay. - Sleep tight. - Okay, I'm taking a shower. Mm hm, enjoy. All right. Holy shit. We did it. Jules? You can open up. What's the magic word? Um, multiple orgasms. That's two words. Okay, no, come on, seriously. Let me in. Come on, you have three seconds. Three, two, one! I wish this day would last forever. I wish this day would last forever, forever, forever, forever, forever. You really love me, huh? You think I look British? Bobby, not so rough, sheesh. What's this, "To Bobby?" I wrote you a letter. - When'd you do that? - When we were fighting. In case I forgot all the terrible, terrible things I wanted to say to you. I really love this day. You know what you need to do, Bobby. Just do the right thing. But we were just fighting. Don't touch me. I'm trying to piece this all together and explain it to you. That's bullshit. I can prove it. I'm really starting to like this island. - You are? - Mm hm, yeah. - Good. - I don't know, with everything going on. Yeah? This is a really nice day with you. I wish it could last forever. I do. Bobby, what's up? - Hey. - What the fuck? What are you doing, Bobby? Bobby! Oh, my God. Bobby! - Hey, Bobby. - Hey! - What the hell, man? - Oh shit. - What do you want? - Shit, I'm sorry, man. I am... Seriously, this is not funny anymore. Calm down, ray of sunshine. You must've done it by habit. You're silly. You're trying to get reception here now? We don't get reception here. Um, I'm gonna call my mom and see if I can get through to her outside, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. That's a nice looking girl you got there. Appreciate it, Larry. Okay, guys. And if you need anything else let me know. - My name's Pearl. - Thank you, Pearl. That's a nice looking girl you got there. Appreciate it, Larry. Hey, genius. It's a toy gun. Can't you feel the weight? What are you horse's ass or what? Shut the fuck up. Damn, he's crazy. Okay, guys. And if you need anything else let me know. - My name's Pearl. - Thank you, Pearl. All right, say it. Come on. Go ahead and say it, Brooklyn. I hope she dumps your ass. - You shut the fuck- - What the fuck? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Shut the fuck up, Brooklyn! Yo, leave that bitch alone. I thought you said no fighting? I don't know what to tell you. You assaulted two people and you broke his nose. Yeah, he probably had it coming to him anyway. - Really, Bobby? - Yeah. Look where you are right now. Where I am? Well, to me, this looks like somewhere safe. God. You two having fun in our little town? Oh, yeah. Time of our fuckin' lives. Are the cuffs necessary, sir? Your boyfriend just punched a local in the face. So, yeah, cuffs. But you're in luck, Mark's not gonna press charges. If it was up to me, you'd be spending a very long time on our island. Still, Mark and Brooklyn are friends of mine. So, you're gonna sit tight while we process you out. You can ponder that for a few hours, tough guy. - All right. - Have a nice night, ma'am. Yeah, okay. All right, yeah. - I'll be here. - Great, well... - What? - Okay. Enjoy yourself in there. I'll bake you a cake. Appreciate it and you know what? I'll be right here. I didn't ask to be bailed out. Look, you've been acting like a complete psycho - all day long. - I'm trying... You know the Bobby that made me not wanna come in the first place? - Yeah, that Bobby. - Please, come on- Why did you bring me here in the first place if you're gonna act like this? I am trying to figure that out myself. Hey, good job, bravo. Because I wanted to spend all day in prison with you. That's what I wanted to do. Really, you're acting like a fucking mental patient! Why? What are you trying to save me from, Bobby? Listen, you don't understand. You don't. You know what, that's the first thing you've said all day that makes complete sense. You're right, I don't understand you and I don't want to. Jules, come on. Listen, I just need you to trust me. Please, trust me. Please. I don't trust you. No! Hey, I'm gonna grab a coffee. - You want one? - Yes, please. Yes, please. Mm, I don't have any service here. Oh, that's a good thing. I was just trying to call my mom and let her know we're alive. Well, good luck with that. Uh huh, should I tell her you said hi? Mm hm. Okay, mother, I'm calling. Hi, Mom. Yeah, sorry. There's barely... No, no, I know, there's barely any service on this island. No, no, I understand. No, I'm good, we're good. Everything's great. Oh, no, it's beautiful here. Yeah, he's good. Uh huh. Mom, I can't hear you. What did you, Mom? Hey, Larry? Would you mind if I bend your ear for a minute? I am a bartender. It's not exactly unusual. Well, you know my girl, Jules, right? About as well as I know you. Okay, well, recently we had a fight, and it was one of those fights that never ends. - Unfinished. - How bad? It's bad, real bad. She accused me of something and what she accused me of, well, she was right. And? I never fessed up to it. So, you're asking me advice about women? Yeah. Having been married four times, I'm not exactly an authority on the subject. I'm not particularly good at it, but one thing I can tell you is that when it comes to women, honestly is not the best policy. It's the only policy. Is that right? And as Shakespeare would say, "The truth will come to light." Yeah, but what if this truth entails me fucking her best friend? - You fucked her best friend? - Yes, I did. And it knocked her up. You fucked her best friend and you made her pregnant? Yes, I did and took her to the clinic. Wow. Yeah. We, hey, we went to the clinic together and everything. Well, then, Bobby, I guess we both know what you have to do. - Stop, stop pouring please. - What? What you doing, Bobby? What does it look like I'm doing? Having drinks, getting lit. Is this a joke? You bet it's a joke. It's one big fuckin' joke. And I'm the fuckin' punch line. But at least this time, thank you, Larry, you're a good man. And this time it ain't gonna hurt as much. It's good stuff. Want some? You gonna have one with me? Hm, what? It's a fuckin' joke. Stop, you gonna have one with me? Yeah, I could use one. Woo, where you goin'? You ain't gonna catch that ferry today. - I'm just ea yin'. - Oh, hello. - Yeah. - Okay, okay. That's different. Like that? - Enjoy, Bobby. - Okay. Hey, look, you're not gonna get off the island. There's no point anyway. Hey, hey! Hey, fuck you, Brooklyn. You're a waste of space. You're just gonna keep on doing this, aren't you? You're just gonna keep on doing this, huh? Huh, Bobby? Look at me, focus and look at me! Listen to me! Because this girlfriend doesn't love you, right? Because I don't love you? Are you seriously not going to look at me right now? Look at me in the face, Bobby! How many times are you gonna do this to me? Listen to me, Bobby, listen to me. I'm right here! I'm trying to talk to you, Bobby. You need to stop fucking drinking because I love you and I care! You need to stop drinking and you need to love me! Really? Okay, walk away, Bobby. Bobby! Bobby! Okay, guys, here you go. And if you need anything else, let me know. My name's Pearl. I hope she dumps your ass. You've lost your very soul, Bobby. You gotta tell her the truth. If you care about the girl, you gotta let her go. You know what you need to do, Bobby. Set her free, man. - Hey. - Hm? I'm gonna tell you something. Hi. I have a few things I wanna talk to you about. - Okay. - Okay. Um, we've been spending a lot of time together, and I know that I've done some stupid shit and fucked up. It's been a long time and this is the hardest thing- Understand that I'm telling you this only because of how much I love you and I fucked up. I can't keep you in a cage. I've done some stupid shit. Ever had to tell anyone. I fucked up. Before Ashley, there was this other girl. Bobby. Come back to bed, baby. There was this other girl. This time I did it. I did it. Robert Patterson, you're under arrest for the murder of Juliet Rable. Ball's in your court, kid. Look, I don't know what you guys want me to tell you that I haven't fucking said 15 times already. The truth works. 'Cause right now you're looking at the death penalty. Look, Robert, I told you in the lobby. You're under arrest for the murder of Juliet Rable. Now, if you'd done this in Philly, you'd only be looking at life. - Dumbass. - This is fuckin' ridiculous. I just spoke with her. Just spoke to her? We got real good acting here, huh, Tony? I don't know what you guys are talking about. I don't know. Robert, we know what you did. We just wanna hear it from you. I love the fucking girl. Why would I kill her? Ashley Myers. She was Juliet's best friend. I don't know that girl. Girl had your abortion. Now you don't know the girl? You got a fucking cold heart, man. No, no, no, you guys are making a mistake. Jules isn't dead, okay? If that's the case, fuckhead, then what the hell are we looking at? 'Cause that sure looks like a dead person to me. This is a mistake, okay? I was just on vacation with her. Bobby, I don't know who you think you were with, but it wasn't her. You know damn well Juliet wasn't there. You know! Why don't you just give Gene a call? Okay, he owns the Cozy Nook. You give him a call, he'll clear this whole thing up. Give him a fuckin' call. Pick up the phone. Give him a call. Robert, you really don't know what you did, do you? You really don't know what you did, do you? Jules, you in there? Yeah, uh, Jules is fine, Mr. Lee. I don't think you can smoke in here. Marry me, Jules. Yeah, just sit there. Just fucking sit there, Bobby. How could you fucking do that, seriously? You're just gonna fucking not listen to me the entire fucking time, huh? Do you even fucking care about me? Do you even fucking care about me, huh? Fucking care about me, huh? - Is that what's gonna happen? - Yeah. And then what are we gonna do? I'm gonna fucking move outta here. Yeah, all right. - I only cheated with you. - Stop it! No more fucking lying! Leave me, is that what you're gonna do, huh? You're just gonna leave me? Like I don't love you? Like I haven't given you everything? I love you. You really love me, huh? A discovery inside a walk-up apartment on Berkeley Place. A woman is dead and police say her boyfriend is responsible. Officers tell us they responded to a domestic disturbance earlier this evening after they got a call from the complex landlord. Officers tell us inside the second floor apartment they found 24 year old Jules Rable is dead in a pool of her blood. The woman had a wound on her neck. Hey. You okay? "I'm done, Bobby, even if you weren't fucking Ashley, which I know you'll never admit to. I'm done. You know I start soon again soon, and I'm finally get along with my mom. It took me a while to admit to myself, but the truth is I just feel better when you're not around. And um, I think I really think that writing this letter is a lot safer than telling you all this in person. There's a real violence in you and I don't wanna be anywhere near you when you finally erupt. Please don't contact me ever again." The doctors I had been speaking with want me to read this letter everyday. To convince me what they said I did is true. That's fine, I'll read it. And they can say whatever they want. I really don't care. 'Cause I know that I beat that bastard. My piss-ant lawyer wants me to say I'm crazy. Why would I do that? I saved her. I'm the hero, not the monster they're describing. And yet, they say I'll be here for a very long time.
