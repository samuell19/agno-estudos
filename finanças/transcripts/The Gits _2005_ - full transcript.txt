(MultiCom Jingle) - [Gits Fan] The Gits, they were about addiction, they were about loss, they were about love. - [Band Member] We became I think, a real band of the people. - [Gits Fan] People were indoctrinated. They came and they saw this band, and it opened some passageway up in them. - [Record Exec] There has not been anything like them since then. - [Band Member] What I was doing, what I love doing, and then, we had to stop doing it. - [Band Member] When Mia was murdered, that just destroyed us all. - [Gits Fan] Everybody was just blown away and stunned, like the world caved in. The fucking walls came tumbling down. - [Band Member] It still makes sad that there's so much more we could have done. - [Gits Fan] What the fuck happened? (light acoustic guitar music) (crowd cheering) (singer muffled) (punk rock music) ♫ When I woke up today ♫ I was dizzy in my brain ♫ It's not that I like to feel this way ♫ The wagon's shaking and I feel it start to tilt ♫ And I just go tumbling right back in a whirlwind - [Narrator] The story of Mia and The Gits, it's not a story about a Seattle band. It's not a story about a punk rock band. It's not a story about a band with a woman singer. This is the story of a great American rock and roll band. - [Steve Voiceover] I started playing music when I was about 11. I tried to be a jazz musician, I really tried to. I always hated that fact that I couldn't get into jazz, and couldn't really enjoy it, because I knew it was a better art form, it was a better music. (drums beating) - [Matt Voiceover] I grew up in Jersey. I spent a lot of Sunday afternoons at CBGB's. I started listening to bands like the Minutemen, the Descendants, and Minor Threat. That's when I was inspired to start playing. - [Andrew Voiceover] The neighborhood I grew up in was way out, in Brooklyn, it's like a neighborhood that time forgot. My first guitar was actually like this, a toy guitar. It had really, really light cheap nylon strings, it was more like a ukulele. I knew I wanted Mia to sing with us. ♫ Where are all these people that you just - [Andrew] In fact I remember, literally crying one of the first times I heard her. - [Matt] I was really happy because I knew that she was good. I didn't know how good. - [Narrator] The story is that her father's family is a distant descendant of Emiliano Zapata, who was a big revolutionary, so she kind of had that in her blood maybe, that like kind of fighting spirit. - What I know of my daughter. She was very quiet, very reserved, ultra ultra shy, the last person in the world who would call attention to herself. And yet, put a microphone in her hand, march her up on a stage, and she was just magnetic. (punk guitar) - [Narrator] Antioch College is in Ohio. It's an old liberal arts school that was regarded highly a long time ago. The Gits were formed in the fall of 1986, after Matt Dresdner came back from a coop in San Francisco. - Went back to Antioch, and I was really inspired to start a band. I knew this guy Andy looked punk rock. - I want you to be the guitarist. So I said sure, you know, whatever, because I didn't take it seriously. - When I first met the members of the Gits, I was into the Kinks, and 60s rock, and The Who, and I loved The Ramones, and some of those bands, but really, I really didn't know much about punk, because it just really didn't exist in Indiana where I grew up. - You know, a week and a half later, we actually, had a band and were practicing for hours every night. - We sort of jammed, we jammed in this old abandoned dorm room at Antioch, and once Mia started singing everything just kind of came together, and it was so much fun. It was just a really soulful band, the songs were really fast and furious. (punk music) - I was in class with Mia, and I remember always being kind of intimidated, like who is this woman? She just commanded respect, and interest immediately. - I was at this party, and it was pretty late, and everyone was drunk, especially Mia. She just like jumped up on a table, out of the blue, and started singing, like Bessie Smith blues or something. And it was like, blew everyone away. - It was really as if like somebody pulled the plug out of the wall, or something. The room kind of stopped. I think it was at that moment when Matt Dresdner heard her sing, that he was like, I'm gonna form a band with her. Her natural performance was just so beautiful, I mean, there was an awkwardness about her, because she would pull her knees together, and you know, she looked like a chicken. I mean she did. But it was awesome because you were like who is this lady, who sings like a heavy angel? It was like, where is Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith? Let's just like, power punch them and power pack them, inside this chicken woman, who's got a lot of heart, you know, what's going on here? - [Matt] When we started the band, we were called the the Sniveling Little Rat Faced Gits. - I wanted to change the name of the fuckin' band, but the other three people in the band would not have it. - A git, it's like a moron, a crackpot, a git is a freak, a git's a dork, a git's a nerd. It's from a Monty Python episode. - Darling, these, these are the gits. (audience laughing) The gits. - Band names are inherently stupid, and they become, just a symbol of the band. - This is Sniveling Little Rat Faced Git. (audience laughing) And this is his wife, Dreary Fat Boring Old Git. (audience laughing) - It doesn't evoke anything. The other three of them, they were just like, the Gits, we're the Gits. - The Gits shows at Antioch were like unparalleled probably to anything that I've seen in a certain sense. ♫ Each time you fall ♫ The pieces are only more and farther between ♫ And those pieces won't hold together ♫ With all the guilt built in your head ♫ Well I see you shake ♫ I see the paint underneath your fingernails ♫ Scratching the walls ♫ Scratching the moments that brought you here ♫ Each time you thought you'd hold on ♫ Trying to stay clean for someone ♫ Maybe you should just take a look inside yourself ♫ Cause you create your own hell - It was time for all of us to leave Antioch. We hadn't all graduated, but it was time to leave. Andy and I knew that we wanted to get as far away from the east coast as we could, So Seattle, felt natural, and we heard that there was a little bit of a music scene burgeoning. As soon as we arrived here, it just felt like home. (punk music) We all lived various places for a few months, until December, when a bunch of us moved into a big old rundown house, that became the main center of our activities for the next several years. We called it the Rat House. - This is 19th Street, and the Rat House is at 19th and Denny, which is, just right on Capital Hill. It was owned by this guy who was a warlock, and he told me that the crows used to all come and land on top of the house, and the neighbors thought that he was a demon, so they spray painted a white cross on the front lawn. He also said that it used to have cockroaches, but he ate a cockroach stew, and this is the guy that rented to us, he made a cockroach stew and ate the stew, and then, from then on, all the cockroaches left. And look we haven't been here for a long time. This Porsche wasn't here. This was a beat up '76 Dodge van that was falling apart. And one time, the brakes gave way and it drove down and we found it in the bushes, like way down the street, and miraculously didn't hit any other cars. It just sort of drove itself and crashed down at the bottom. When this fence wasn't there, there was a porch there in front of the door, and that's where we used to sit, and talk about projects and drink and hang out. - Out of all of us, Mia had been the first one of us to become gainfully employed, and she got a job as a waitress at the Frontier Room, and she made about $4.25 an hour. - But it used to be the toughest dive bar, and nastiest greasy spoon restaurant in town. - And we were here every day. - Because she would feed us. - Because she would feed us, and we didn't have much money, and I think we spent, probably every day for about a year, year and a half, at this waterfront dive. - See that's where Mia used to live, in that room back there. I used to live up there, in that top floor there, actually I had the best room. And Carla and Julien lived in that bottom area, which used to be a church chapel I guess. And there was an altar in there, where the church used to be, and they had their bed on altar, which is kind of, risque. - So beautiful, it was just so nice to meet people, and I just kind of had this same mind, that's the way we want to live our life. - You had beer dripping off the wall, because people were rowdy, it was punk rock. What do you expect? So people would like break through windows, break things, fall over, dump their beer, throw their beer, I mean it was just incredible. It was just totally insane. - Here we are, in front of this hair salon, that used to be the foremost live music venue in Seattle, a club called The Vogue. - We were trying to get a gig there for like months. And no one would, the guy wouldn't book us at all. - We actually bribed him with a dollar. The first night at The Vogue was our foot in the door in Seattle. - [Mia] Hey Jewel, less vocals in this monitor and more guitar. You'll get him off me. (loud punk music) ♫ Well I don't need your social love, no ♫ I feel misread enough ♫ And what repels me ♫ Is the fact that you're smiling ♫ Walking on by, well just keep on walking ♫ Yeah when it hits me ♫ See it still gets kinda heavy - You know how many times do you go see a band, it's like well, okay. Start playing, and something happens. With them it was like, and oh, fuck. ♫ You never look me in the eye ♫ Or feel the truth ♫ Yeah when it hits me ♫ I see you still gets so heavy ♫ Yeah when it's laying there over ♫ It's wide open and read - [Eric] They're bringing something else to the table that no one else around here has. - I remember I brought some friends to see their show, and everybody just got along really instantly, yeah instantaneous, they were just like, a most sensitive kind of whole punk rock scene there. A lot of people became very, it was on the same, everybody was kind of on the same level, coming from the same place. - Down there is where we had our rehearsal studio, 7 Year Bitch, DC Beggars, the Gits, Big Brown House, and all the bands rehearsed down there. - I can remember when 7 Year Bitch got started, there was Valerie Agnew, who at the time was Steve's girlfriend, and Selene, and Stefanie Sargent, and Liz Davis, and the were all huge fans of music, and huge fans of the Gits. We so respected and admired and looked up to them, and just thought they were the shit. - So when we first started playing, it was like, we had to borrow their gear, I mean we didn't know shit, we didn't know what the hell we were doing, so they just totally helped us, and listened to us thrashing away and banging around down there, I mean I can't even imagine, what it was like for them. - You would have to go and get like, a half rack of beer, to loosen up and get comfortable enough to start playing. - [Valerie] 'Cause we were like, you gotta go away, like go somewhere else. - [Selene] Yeah, just go away, don't listen to us. - Ah, get that fucking camera out of my face. - Please Stefie, lighten up will ya? - [Eric] There was so much encouragement, probably specifically from Mia to say, you guys can do this, you don't need to just stand in the audience. - [Selene] She's like, no you should be the singer, and I'm like, okay. Steve is such (muffled). We meet this other girl, Elizabeth, who also worked in the market, oh she's queen bitch. Let's have her come out there and jam with us. - And he would always come up to me like, what are you doing? It's good, it's real, it's true, you guys sound really good. And she paid attention, she would like would pick out certain things. Like you knew she wasn't just giving it lip service. - And I knew that her bedroom was right above our practice space, and it was like whoa that was really like intimidating. - I realized that sort of our ethic, the reason we were doing it, fit more into the category of punk, than anything else. - We were bored, we were young, we were a little bit drunk, and little bit angry, and we had a lot of energy. What we considered punk was the whole do it yourself ethic. If you need to make something happen, you decided you were gonna do it, and you started from scratch and you just did it, and that's how we put out our first record. - And we'd have these haphazard meetings, everybody's all, whatever, drinking, okay we gotta get serious, we're gonna put out this compilation, and we're gonna do this. - [Matt] So we pooled all the different people that were in bands, and said hey, you want to put a cut on this record? Give us a tape. - At a time which we didn't even realize, there was such a huge thing about to happen in that city. - We had no other family here, so our family was us. - The Comet was like the bar they went to most of the time, and the Comet knew that if there was a party at the Rat House, everybody was basically invited. You know, so it was many times that it's like, people would just show up. - There was gonna be the big Rat House party. The Gits were playing, the Beggars, and 7 Year Bitch, just, let's go. New Years. - New Years Eve show that we did at the Rat House was all like, and everybody like no fuckin' war, and we were all just like really, there was all that going on, that was affecting everybody's whole psyche, and just whatever. - [Crowd Member] No fuckin' war. No fuckin' war. - [Andrew] The war, before there was a band, or before there was a show, or before there was a rehearsal, there was our friendship and our loyalty to one another. - I think that was kind of the spirit of the Rat House, and like the thing that was going on there. It was just easy, and free, and fun. (loud punk music) ♫ I tend to drink too much sometimes ♫ I fall a little drunk on my face ♫ I get up I brush up I head to the bar ♫ For another round with all of my friends ♫ Here's to 'em here's to all of my friends ♫ Here's to 'em here's to all of my friends yeah ♫ Here's to 'em here's to all of my friends ♫ Here's to 'em, to all of my friends ♫ It's all I got left in the end are my friends - From the the get-go, this chemical thing, where things would just sort of organically materialize, and songs would happen, more than be written. - A few times I just messed around with some shit on guitar, and the other guys were like, oh is that a new song? And I'd be like, yeah it is, even though it wasn't, but I would tell them that because, the thing is when you're in a band, you get bored pretty easily. You constantly get bored of your shit, and you want to do something new, and that's how bands get better and better from doing this. You know a lot of songs, too, I would just bring the entire song fully formed, and show the band, and they would arrange it. Other things, I didn't have fully formed, I just had these parts, but I knew sort of the order, and then, we would arrange it together as a group, mostly me and Matt, or me, Matt, and Steve. - [Steve] Matt, he would come up with great basslines. He had a really good ear, and he could sort of, describe what he wanted, and Matt would turn it into something that was unique. - [Matt] Both Steve and Andy were just amazing players, and trying to keep up with their musicianship forced me to learn very quickly. - If the three of us were working on stuff or whatever, Mia would come down with a tape recorder, and listen to it for a while, and then eventually, after she heard it a couple times, she'd tape it, and then bring it upstairs, and then we wouldn't hear from her about it for a while, and then we'd have have a period where it was just the three of us pretty much working on stuff, and then we'd start hassling her, you know? So Zapata, where's our lyrics? Yeah, you'll get it eventually, you'll get it when I'm ready. A lot of times she had these journals, these little journal books, and a lot of times at the bar or wherever she was hanging out, she was by herself a lot of times. She would just sit around and write in them. ♫ Hey you walk in with another headache ♫ I can tell by the lines in your face ♫ You seem to think if you just remove the problem ♫ The answers are what will come next ♫ Another shot of whiskey ♫ And maybe I'll be ready ♫ For what's still crowded in your head ♫ Never thinking that all the good times ♫ Are what walked in with the bad ♫ I don't know why we compromise ourselves ♫ I thought it was a common understanding ♫ With all I've tried to help with ♫ Tell me, why do I end up empty handed ♫ Another couple of beers while I'm safe here at the bar ♫ And maybe I'll get me some rest ♫ Don't know why all the good times ♫ Have to turn up with the bad - I thought she was a great lyricist, I thought she had some great words. - Andy's unusual mind, was greatly like enhanced by his support, that Mia would give him, and there's just this emotional link. - They were not lovers, they weren't a romantic duo, they were an artistic duo. Their depth of their connection, was really in the music. It's a lyricist, and a music writer, who understand each other's rhythms. - Her and Andy, they brought the best out in each other. He kind of understood what she could sing, and would push her to her limits. The two just really created something that was bigger than the both of them as individuals. - She was really like my soulmate, as far as my music soulmate. It's kind of a miracle to meet someone like that in this life. (punk music) ♫ When I'm going into the bar ♫ I'm there trying to ignore ♫ This terror in me, I can't set it free - Wingo Lamo, that was always one of my favorites, when I wrote the music to that, I was in the Rat House basement, and it just come together really quickly, and I just knew, I just had a really good feeling about it. It's funny because the chorus, Mia says, "immobilized by the torment." I didn't know what the words were because I hadn't read them. I thought she was saying, "just like my father told me." one time I asked her, so Mia what are you saying about your father in that one song? I'm not saying, just like my father told me, you idiot. But we always laughed at that, when we'd play it live sometimes, and she would say, "just like my father told me." ♫ Just like my father told me ♫ It hits so hard, there's nothing more I can take ♫ Needing each breath just to make it through ♫ There's nothing more you're expected to do - [Mia] Woo, doggies. - The stuff that was getting all the publicity, was basically the Subpop bands, and this grunge thing, which was fine, for whatever it was, but we had nothing to do with it. ♫ Shove your lies up your ass, I hope you choke on his cock ♫ When I found out honey I'll tell ya it wasn't a shock ♫ You're full of shit and you sure know how to suck ♫ Here's to it baby, here's to your fuck - [Andy] Here's To Your Fuck, obviously, you know I stole the title from David Lynch from Blue Velvet. Fuck, fuck this shit, and fuck my health sucks, here's to your fuck. Here's to your fuck, Frank. ♫ Didn't mean to hurt me, its touching your sympathy ♫ Have fun with prickface ♫ Cause you sure fucking blew it with me ♫ You're full of shit, sure know how to suck ♫ Here's to it baby, here's to your fuck ♫ Well baby, now this is the fucking end ♫ You sure got a fucked up way of making friends ♫ You're full of shit, sure know how to suck ♫ Here's to it baby, here's to your fuck (audience cheering) - Thank you all for that kind of patience, smile for the camera. - Mia was doing something that was unique in 1993, and it's unique today. This raw, pitch-brilliant blues singer, singing as this charismatic front to this whirlwind of a punk rock band. I'm so lucky to have seen it. - She could have really sang in any type of band, and she would have always been the spotlight, the point of focus. - We're The Gits. - All right man, I'd like to thank all you people, who came out tonight. It makes us feel good coming back here. - She didn't give a shit, and it totally came out. - Because she wasn't afraid of abrasiveness. How sloppy you are in life, there's a beauty to it. ♫ I tear myself apart ♫ And throw it on the ground in front of you ♫ Can't hide that I'm a social wreck - There was a soulfulness that came out of Mia, and there was a rawness. ♫ And as far as I can see it ♫ I ain't got nothing else ♫ And with all that you've taken from me ♫ Well, go ahead and answer that yourself - The intensity within her was like something that was like, both punk rock, and blues, because it had that depth. - I mean you'd have to be a fucking zombie, to not be affected. ♫ And as far as I can see it ♫ Hell, I ain't got nothing else ♫ And with all that you've taken from me ♫ Well, go ahead and answer that yourself ♫ Don't, don't try it with me, ♫ But don't, don't tell me lies ♫ And then call it some kind of truth ♫ Go ahead and walk me walk closer ♫ Escort me right to the edge ♫ Push me, push me I don't care ♫ Cause I'll keep coming back ♫ Slightly stronger, despite the worlds ♫ You've left and unbled and said ♫ Well just keep your twisting, keep your twisting ♫ But I'll keep breathing, I keep breathing (audience cheering) - It never really sunk in that there was this tremendous following of fans, and not to sound melodramatic, but even people who worshiped the ground she walked on, I never thought of her as a star. She's just my daughter, you know, my daughter, Mia Zapata, 27 years old, and double-jointed. That's who she was. Who when we were on camping trips as a young kid, would get mosquitoes in her hair, flies in her hair, and was always sitting around, trying to figure out how to get all these flies out of the knots in her hair. - My mother has this great idea that we're gonna go to the local bar in Sandpoint, Idaho, and we go to this open mic night. And I'm scared to death. Of course, we walk in, and everybody's singing country songs, and of course, everybody's kind of looking at Mia, and Mia beelines right for the guy handling the thing, and says, would you mind if I borrowed your guitar? Oh yeah, what are you gonna do? She's like, I'd like to sing a few songs. And she gets up there in her fur coat, and her dreads, and bleached out roots, and she looks nuts, she looks like she doesn't belong there. She blew this room away. The shots were being sent to the table, shaking hands, and it was the introduction to Mia's talent, that I never knew. - She didn't have your typical sense of humor, and she couldn't tell a joke worth her life, but somehow everything she said had a sort of dry wit, and bite to it. We'd be driving along, hour upon hour, and there'd be some cows out in the pastures, and every time we saw cows, she would just go, those cows, they're outstanding in their field. The worst part though, was when she tried to relate that humor on stage, when Mia would try to fill the gaps by saying something funny. And no one ever got what she was saying. - She didn't know how to drive at all, and she loved the idea of driving. She convinced someone else who didn't know, who just assumed that she had a license. And she was like, can I drive us back to the Rat House, from the Comet? And he was like, yeah sure. You have your car, right? He's like, yeah. She's like, okay. - And Mia you know, I don't really remember all these tall buildings near your house. She just turned around, she's like, shut up, I'm taking you the scenic route. - She would have been great if she was singing with an acoustic guitar. She would have been great if she was singing in a techno band. As it happened, she was singing in a punk rock band. Second Skin, I don't know. Maybe I have a prejudice because I put the single out, but I thought it was their best song. And I couldn't believe they picked me to put it out. - We were just kind of playing around, and all of a sudden this song evolved. I imagine specifically, Andy probably came up with a riff. - When we were doing Second Skin, and recording that in the studio, everyone left and Mia did the vocals by herself, and I was the first one to come back, and I thought her vocal performance was just really wonderful, and Mia just looked at me and she said, yeah, it's real desperate, it's more desperate sounding than what we've been coming up with, up until this point. - I mean it had everything that we liked about music, the driving force, the emotions of Mia's lyrics, and for the first time it was kind of catchy, too. ♫ I've thought about it, hell ♫ About a million times ♫ It takes all my strength ♫ Just to keep me calm ♫ But I have to tell myself, it's best just to breathe ♫ Holding it inside will only help to do me in ♫ Each time I close my eyes ♫ I see another chain ♫ It's one I can't forget ♫ Something I can not break out of ♫ I need a second skin ♫ Something to hold me up ♫ Can't seem to get out of this hole ♫ I've dug myself right back in ♫ Just to wake up tells me, hell, I must be brave ♫ It hits me like a drug ♫ Shot into my vein ♫ It's not as delightful ♫ Delightful of a pain ♫ Immobilizing me ♫ Almost makes think i'm dead ♫ I need that second skin ♫ Something to hold me tough ♫ Can't do it on my own ♫ Sometimes I need just a little more help, well ♫ I want that chance to give every drop that's left in me ♫ I need a second skin ♫ Something I cannot break free of ♫ I just tell myself, girl, just let it breathe ♫ It's a calmness I'm always searching for ♫ But the dirt it gets so heavy ♫ It falls above my head ♫ Seeping from under my feet ♫ It just keeps on getting deeper ♫ I need a second skin ♫ Something to hold me up ♫ Can't do it on my own ♫ Sometimes I need just a little more help ♫ I've got that chance to give every drop that's left in me ♫ I need a second skin ♫ Something I cannot break free of ♫ Though no ever said it'd be easy ♫ Still one's left to deny ♫ The choice that comes between ♫ Your willingness to survive ♫ Though you're knowing what you stand up against ♫ A world set to deceive ♫ You need a special strength yeah ♫ I've got that second skin yeah ♫ I've got that chance to give ♫ I've got the only way that I know how to live with it ♫ I need a second skin ♫ Something to hold me tough ♫ I need a second skin ♫ Something I cannot break free of - We're playing tomorrow night at the (muffled). - We get into the parking lot, and she makes me promise that I will not make a scene in Tower Records. And then of course, I immediately go to this local section, and there it is, a Gits CD. And so I'm, hey Mia, come over here, come over here. Dad, your voice is too loud, your voice is too loud, Dad, you're making a scene, you're making a scene. I'm getting out of here. No, come here, let me show you. She's pulling on my sleeve, and I'm pointing at the CD. So finally, I acquiesced, and we leave the store. She's saying, why did you do that? I didn't do anything. All I did was hold up your CD. She says, it embarrasses me. I said, why would it embarrass you? This is what you do for a living. You don't think of it like that, Dad. - It must have been stunning, to feel that you are a part of a scene that the whole world was looking at, because everyone's eyes were on Seattle right then. - When 7 Year Bitch got rolling, totally out of the basement of the Rat House, with so much help from them, and we started to get popular, and then even to the point where we were getting signed and stuff, it was really weird. ♫ You kissed me once ♫ And you kissed me twice ♫ With your mess of slobbering lips ♫ With dribble in my brow ♫ I wait until you turned around ♫ And wiped it on my pant leg - [Matt] We were a little envious, we were like fuck these guys are going to New York and playing these shows. - [Steve] We taught them how to play their instruments, and they're playing in New York before us. - They're gonna be on the cover of the Rocket, and we barely ever got mentioned in that rag. ♫ 'Cause now I wonder where you are ♫ Oh now I wonder where you are ♫ Yeah now I wonder where the hell you are - This is what happens I suppose in an intense rock scene, you either become rivals or you become friends, and they were clearly friends. - [Matt] There was a documentary filmmaker in town, and he was working on a movie called Hype, that was about the Seattle scene. 7 Year Bitch was asked to be a part of it, and I think they asked Doug Pray, the filmmaker... - Have you guys talked to The Gits yet? Because like, if you haven't, get on it. - And eventually he contacted us, and we were always a little bit wary of film people. - We were always kind of like, yeah I don't know about you. We're gonna have to think about this. We don't talk to you society people. ♫ Awaken in a state it's not my own ♫ The only thing that's real ♫ Is that amongst these walls ♫ I whisper to a fear that sleeps in my soul ♫ Weighting on my conscience, but I think I know ♫ It hurts me to be angry ♫ Kills me to be kind ♫ But my only torment ♫ Is my own disguise ♫ Waiting on these favors they only come to show ♫ There's not much in them for you to hold - I heard about Mia Zapata, through the scene. I knew 7 Year Bitch, and Tad, and you know Soundgarden, and it was sort of like, oh there's this really great singer, you have to see her. There's this really great singer, you have to see her. - One of the guys from Subpop knew me from the Frontier Room, and had seen us one of our very first shows, and he asked us if we would be interested in playing, opening for Tad and Nirvana. - Nirvana was just breaking, and Soundgarden and all these bands were becoming really trendy and hip, in the US. But we were like, fuck it, let's go to Europe. - [Andy] That we were completely unknown at the time to the Europeans, they treated us like royalty, and we made many great friends and played some spectacular shows. - We played this place called the Ecstasy, and it was this huge club, and we ended up going on at three in the morning, and the place was packed with people. But at that point in time, Seattle bands were considered so hip. I remember one show in Denmark, we were playing with this band called, Life But How to Live It, from Oslo, Norway. And the singer from that band, she was singing all the words to our songs, and she just totally dug Mia's lyrics. It was probably one of the best things that we did as a band. - We became, I think, a real band of the people. Actually, someone said that to me, and it was really true. - We got back home. 7 Year Bitch had just played a real big show, I think opening for the Chili Peppers. The sort of fast success of 7 Year Bitch at that time, a little momentum, became too much for Stefanie Sargent. And she had been fighting a heroin addiction. It snuck up and bit her on the ass. Mia was especially crushed by Stefanie's death. ♫ There is a silence that paces us all ♫ It's sensitive to the peace that we've known ♫ And if I could take that crevice in me ♫ I'd fill it up with all that you bleed ♫ When I was walking into the water ♫ And I was trying not to breathe ♫ I could feel the current pulling ♫ And I just kept in deeper ♫ I'm sick of the pain that you're feeling ♫ It's weighing you down ♫ If I could erase it all within just one dive ♫ I wrap you precious around my soul ♫ And now I'm letting you go ♫ As I drown these evil spirits and penetrate the obstacles ♫ I feel the seaweed creeping up my skin ♫ It's like a monster that's reaching for me ♫ With the passion of life I've got left ♫ I've got to use it to sacrifice myself - And one time I think it was Mia, Stefanie, and maybe Maria, I remember seeing them all in the lake. They were tangled up in a lot of seaweed, and they were all screaming and squawking and wrestling in all this stuff in the water. It was just so funny, because, although they were these total insane, punk rock women, they looked like little girls. They were all like (screaming). Screaming in the water, and you could tell when one of them would get caught in the seaweed, and they were totally like, oh... (screaming) even more than the others, and try to pull the others in it. And Mia told me that's from going into the seaweed like that, that's where she came up with the lyrics to Seaweed. ♫ Well, I dove down into the seaweed ♫ Scared once before, but not anymore ♫ As it twists and turns me away from the surface ♫ Here's my chance of letting it go ♫ I'm sick of the pain that I'm feeling ♫ It's weighing me down ♫ If I could erase it all ♫ Within just one fuckin' dive ♫ I wrap you precious around my soul ♫ And now I'm letting you go ♫ As I drown these evil spirits ♫ And penetrate the obstacles (audience applauding and cheering) - Thank you very much, we have CD's, tapes, records, got a compilation over there with all Seattle bands, and San Francisco bands, (muffled) 7 Year Bitch. It's all for sale right there. - Things just seemed to keep building and building, and we had all kinds of tours that were being set up, national tours, our first gig in New York was set up, and we were really looking forward to that. - Hi Dad, this is Mia. Well I'm down here in LA, and I'm in this fancy restaurant. We're sitting here with these executives from this recording company, and well they're making an awful lot of promises to us, of what can happen, and how they can help us, and all of that. - And I sat with them, and at that moment, I committed myself to the idea, that I was going to sign this band, that they were going to be on Atlantic Records. - One of the executives was asking the group, what their aspirations, what their goals were. And when they got to Mia, she said, well all I really want, is a cabin in the woods, an English sheepdog and a Jeep, and to be able to sit and write music. And one of the executives said, we can give you that right now. - I don't know whether they had committed themselves to that idea. But I had decided that I was going to make them a firm offer, to be on Atlantic. And in fact, this was June, 1993. - This was the beginning of so much great stuff to come. It was just a real, totally creative group. It was just so spontaneous that way. ♫ When I woke up today ♫ I was dizzy in my brain ♫ It's not that I like to feel this way ♫ The wagon's shaking and I feel it start to tilt ♫ And I just go tumbling right back in a whirlwind ♫ Where I find myself again ♫ Well I cannot seem to hold on to a fucking thought ♫ This whirlwind's got me and I'm racing out the door ♫ It's nice for a while, but when I try to focus ♫ All of my convictions come crashing down around me again - We were sitting at the corner end of the bar, and there's the door, and Mia was in a really good mood, because she had just played a solo show in LA, and had gotten paid for it, and she was really psyched about it. She was very loving, and really like hugged us deeply, and licked my face, and did a Mia maneuver you know? And she left the bar, and it was about midnight, maybe a little after. And I got the call from Steve saying, that Mia was missing, and he was hoping that it wasn't a repeat of Stefanie, which made me think, drug-related, which didn't make sense. She said she was gonna take a cab, she was doing this, she was doing that, and that we were just having a regular night at the Comet, like we would normally have. - [Narrator] Two of her roommates finally broke down and called the morgue, where she was, and she was unidentified, an unidentified victim at the morgue at that time. - [News Reporter] 27 year old Mia Zapata was a singer on the brink of making it big. The band, The Gits, had recently released a full-length CD. National tour dates had just been finalized, but it's all over now. Zapata's body was found early Wednesday morning on a remote street in the central district. Zapata had been strangled. Police are investigating but so far they have no suspects or motives. - You can imagine how devastated I was, when I learned about that, and how angry I was, that that could happen. - And I just remember feeling like holy shit, like the world caved in, the fucking walls came tumbling down. It was hard. - Out of all this, we were all so devastated, but I think it was really most difficult for my mother, because, and my father too, I mean that was their little girl, and they were so proud of her because she really paved her own road. - You think things are bad, and they get so much worse, and you have to handle it. You have to deal with it, and you have to persevere, and you have to carry on, and you have to hold each other up, and keep each other up but it was so hard. It was really a devastating thing, her death, there was no rhyme or reason to it, it was so, definitely, she was there, and she was gone. She was missing in action, it was just like she was just taken out, like so violently. - There's no (muffled) for that. ♫ Cut my skin, it makes me human ♫ Scorn your mind ♫ Just feel the pain ♫ 'Cause it's what makes us human ♫ Yeah it keeps us all the same - That was a heavy time. That was heavy. You lose a few people like that, in your immediate world. It sucked a big one. - I think we were really hitting some strides musically, and in our writing, when Mia was killed. - It's really a shame because we had so much lined up. Mia had started writing music again, and she had played me this piece on piano, during her lunch break at the pizza place where she worked. To me I just felt like this was the beginning, of so much great stuff to come. And it's just a real shame obviously, that it never got to be. - Everybody was just blown away, and just stunned, and just, grasping at anything, and trying to figure it out. It was a mystery, it was a grand mystery. And I think that the main thing, for me at that time, was that she was gone, and that she was dead, and that she had suffered. Because she had suffered. And that was the hit that I kept getting, what did she go through? What were her last moments like? What the fuck happened? - We've got her whereabouts at about 2:15 in the morning, and it was probably about a one hour, an hour and 15 minute timeframe, from the time she was last seen, till the time her body's found, and we have no idea what happened at that time. This is the area, 24th and Yessler, this is where Mia's body was found. At that time it was nothing like the way it is today. It was kind of a field area, somewhat isolated. And it was a young lady who was out, she came across Mia's body, and she ran across the street, there's a fire station there. And she woke up the firefighters. They came out here and called paramedics, and like I say, they tried to do the best they could, but it was too late at that point. Mia was already dead. - I remember that night when we were with her, but then I don't remember anything until the funeral, you know being at the funeral home with everybody. It sticks in my head so vividly. - On the day of the wake, I happened to look outside, and the line kept getting longer, and now it was like a half a block long. And all you could come up with is, is well these are fans and friends of Mia. - It blew my mind, how many people knew Mia, but Mia also knew them back. - We went over to the casket. And laying in the casket, around Mia, there were snips of hair. There were rings, neck chains, labels, and postcards, poems, all laying, very respectfully laying around her head and shoulders, and on her chest. It was just absolutely unbelievable. There was a wake that her friends, her fans, was then holding that evening. There were posters scattered all over Seattle, announcing where this wake was going to be held. The only admission was one yellow rose, that's all you had to bring. And the significance of that was that Mia loved yellow roses. We, as a family, were in my car, and we were driving to the street that the wake was going to be held on, and the building. I made a couple of wrong turns, and at a certain point, I said, wait a minute. Look, I don't know exactly where we're going, but if you'll notice, on the streets, there are people carrying yellow roses, and they are walking to where the location of this wake, and we'll just follow them. - She touched a lot of people, and a lot of people considered Mia their best friend, because she probably was, best friend to a lot of people, because she was a great friend. - [Andy] People who never knew Mia often have a lot of misconceptions of what she was like. They often imagine that she was a real tough girl, or that she was some type of selfless martyr or saint. I would say that those two things are distortions of qualities, which she did in fact possess. But in reality she was a very modest person. She was extremely affectionate and sincere, very very intelligent, and really funny. She was very private and very gentle. - Mia and I were just, had a beautiful relationship. She was my best friend. And just musically, it was just amazing, an amazing partnership. I really felt like she was part of me. - This is a painting, it's on the album, that I did of Mia. It's actually, probably, one of the most, it probably is the most difficult painting I've ever done. I did it the day that she died. I don't know how many years ago it was today, it still makes me really emotional inside to talk about it. But I mean I can't, I don't know, that's why I paint pictures. - She was on loan to me. And she now belongs to all of you. And it's neat, I like it. I'm proud of her. ♫ There are these things I want the most ♫ But usually one step furthest from my reach ♫ But they always stand close enough ♫ To take me to the next drink ♫ Cause when it cuts, it really does ♫ My soul spills out blood ♫ Don't know how long it's gonna take ♫ But I'm gonna need a little more one day ♫ Sometimes, I just want to know ♫ Faster than that train is gonna roll ♫ Is it real or, tell me, is it wrong ♫ To keep these dreams strongest in my mind - Our office was involved with the Seattle police department, from the inception of the case. We knew that we had a tough case on our hands. There were things about the case that led to one scenario that is always bothersome from a law enforcement perspective, which is, if it's a relatively random, type of crime, there's going to be less clues, less evidence, to glean, to collect. - The theory is, and for the most part, it works, a female is gonna be killed by someone she knows. When someone's murdered, there are other victims, there's collateral damage. And it's the family, and close friends, and associates, because everybody assumes, it's one of us. And who is it? - It broke it apart, and it was never the same again. A whole like dark cloud came over everything, and stayed there. - When Mia was murdered, that just destroyed us all. All our friends' bands, everyone just broke up. We just pretty much lost it. - At the time, a lot of our friends were being questioned, and being taken in to give samples and stuff, close friends of ours, male friends and stuff, and that were coming up to us, and saying, God I had to go down to the police station and be questioned and give them a sample and stuff, and how harsh it was for them, and how we were feeling. At the time, now we're back there at the time, and it was bringing up all those feelings like, yeah you didn't know if it was the guy that was sitting across the bar from you every night. - We decided two weeks after she was killed, that the police weren't doing enough, and that we had to hire a private investigator. By end of August, we had started the investigation and we started a campaign to raise money for it. And we called on our friends that played in different bands to play benefit shows at different clubs around town. - The guys in The Gits called, to see if I would be interested. They were doing some benefit stuff to raise money for a private I. - It somehow came up in the studio with Joan, and she's just like, we've got to do something. We gotta be involved. - I think somehow we got around to talking about playing some of the Gits' songs. - Next thing you know, she's like, singing the Gits songs, with the surviving members of the Gits. - The band that we created with the remaining Gits and myself, we called Evil Stig, which means, Gits Live, backwards. - I'd like to thank you all right here, real quick, for coming out to Viva Zapata. Thank you for supporting. ♫ Awaken in a state it's not my own ♫ The only thing that's real - Andy, Matt, and Steve, were nothing but beautiful souls to me. I can't imagine what they were going through. I really can't. I cannot imagine that happening. And when you see the footage, and you see how close they were, and you see Andy and Mia joking on stage, and you see this rapport, and how close they were. It really had to be devastating. So I really think it's admirable what they did. I think Mia would proud of them, what they did. - The amount of bands that got involved, which was The Posies, Presidents of the United States, Nirvana, when Kurt was alive, Eddie Vedder, Soundgarden, and they all brought things, I think Soundgarden lent us some of the equipment, like the drums, and what not. - I wanted to do the music proud, I wanted to do a good job. I wanted to raise a lot of money, to make sure we were able to give the private I something good and helpful. So, you just wanted to do everything justice, I suppose. - To actually get a huge group of people like that together to come up with the money to hire a private investigator, because we didn't know what the Seattle police was... - How far they were gonna take it. - You have to so something too, you know. ♫ Will there be hundreds mourning for you ♫ Will they talk of the talent and inspiration you gave ♫ No ♫ Who besides your mother ♫ Will stand in sorrow at your grave ♫ Mother may I ♫ Momma Mia ♫ Society did this to you ♫ Does society have justice for you ♫ If not ♫ I do - In the end, I think we raised close to $50,000 for the investigation, and it didn't come to anything. We found out a lot of dirt about a lot of people, but in the end, we didn't find out who killed her, and we still haven't. - Looking back on all that stuff, there's really creepy foreshadowing, in their songs, and everywhere you look. ♫ Never ceases to amaze me the shit you try to pull ♫ Anything to get me in and then get me killed ♫ Go ahead and slice me up, spread me all across this town ♫ Cause you know you're the one that won't be found - After she was killed, it was very, very difficult to listen to that song. Go ahead and slash me up, and spread me all across this town, because you're the one that won't be found. I mean gosh, how could you not equate that with what happened to her? ♫ Then you raped her ♫ You left her in the alley way ♫ I know I'll have to see you ♫ And now I think of you as mine - I'd like to let her lyrics speak for themselves, and I have my own interpretation of what that was, and I do know some of the stuff she was going through personally at the time, but I think lyrics should be taken in by everyone that hears them individually, and looked at on a personal level from the listener. - My personal opinion is that she was trying to make a serious song, about violence against women. - The cops were telling us, don't tell anyone that Mia was raped. And we were like, fuck that. - It could have been me, it could have been anybody, but it was Mia, and she was so fierce, and so street smart. - There was an incredible sense of disempowerment, after Mia was killed. We didn't feel safe, we were freaked out, the whole city was pretty freaked out. The community was freaked out. - The anger started kicking in really hard, but such intense anger and just fuckin' rage. - Valerie called me from the road, and said, we have to get together as soon as I get back. We've got to do something. She was just all like freaked out. - We were just like, thinking in the modes of self-defense, like wishing that we were all fucking ninja bitches. - We didn't like feeling afraid. We felt, we don't want to change the way we live. We want to be able to go out, see shows, play shows, drink, have it be two o'clock in the morning, and get home. We just want to get home without being fucked with. - And that's kind of the inception of Home Alive. And it's still around, and still doing it. And I think we've accomplished our goals and beyond. - [Gretta] There was a sense of, we're all taking care of ourselves, and each other, we're watching each other's backs at the same time. - Seeing like, from Home Alive, people are trying to make something positive happen, from something really horrible. And I remember thinking, like getting a lot of inspiration and hope from that. - Definitely for me, made it a little easier to deal with, with the violence that she suffered. - After The Gits ended, we started the Dancing French Liberals of '48. It was really therapeutic, because it was a hard core band, and we played hard, and we played fast. And we rehearsed a lot, and our goal was to be able to play at the record release party for our second album, which would be released posthumously. That was the record release party for Enter the Conquering Chicken. And it was also really cool finishing that album up, after Mia had passed away, because we felt close to her, because we were able to hear her sing, and listen to her really doing her thing. ♫ Nothing like pain to make you all the same - [Mia] God, I'm not a guitar player. All right, one more, and we'll (muffled). That's mine. Adrian. I can take a yell anyway you dog. ♫ Well I don't need your social love, no ♫ I feel misread enough ♫ And what ails me ♫ Is the fact that you're smiling ♫ Walking on by, walking on by ♫ Yeah when it hits me ♫ See it still gets kinda heavy ♫ Yeah when it's laying there over ♫ It's wide open and read ♫ Well I don't need your social love, no ♫ I feel misread enough ♫ And what ails me ♫ Is the fact that you're smiling ♫ Walking on by, keep on walking ♫ Yeah when it hits me ♫ See it still gets kinda heavy ♫ Yeah when it's laying there over ♫ It's fucking wide open and read ♫ I don't need your social crap ♫ You head iron sleep boys ♫ I can see, what ails me ♫ Is your pretentious stare - In the 10 years that have passed since that, the crime, her true goodness has come out. - After the tragedy of Mia's death, I think it's really amazing that we have all of these recordings. And so many people took photographs, and there's film that you guys have compiled, and it's all there, and I'm glad that's there. But it still makes me sad that there's so much more we could have done. - If anything, I like to discuss more things that are positive about the Gits, and the musical legacy, and the artistic legacy that Mia left. - Probably, if the Gits had some kind of mission or quest, it was to put some soul back into that kind of music, and I think we did, and that's why I, still, I think people respond to it, and care about it, and why it continues to matter to people. - Oftentimes in the history of popular music, women artists take a while for really their influence to be felt. And I think it's a ripe time for the Gits' influence to be felt, and Mia's influence, because a new generation of artists, like the Yeah Yeah Yeah's, and the Distillers, are taking from Mia, without even knowing they're taking from Mia. - What she was about, and that type of life force, that seemed unique, and to think that that was just strangled away from all of us, is just very sad. - [Steve] Every hour that goes by after a crime, it gets harder to solve. But, it doesn't mean it won't be. - It's always, it's always going to be, always will be, in the back of your head. - I tried to keep those guys' hopes up that we would find a killer, but it was terribly disheartening. - In any case, we never saw the file, so we don't know if there's any evidence. Basically we don't know anything, and that's how it's been, and that's how it still is. - [Steve] Short of somebody turning someone else in, or somebody confessing, we're fucked, we're still in the dark. And that person is still out there, obviously. - [Announcer] Number one in western Washington, with coverage you can count on, KING 5 News, at five. - A local murder mystery dating back a decade, may be solved tonight. Police in Florida arrest a suspect, somebody they believe killed Seattle grunge singer, Mia Zapata. It was a horrific unsolved murder case that shocked Seattle's music scene, and now, a documentary is being made about the band, The Gits, its success, and its demise. But this documentary will now have a different ending. - I got a call on my cell phone from KING 5, the TV station, and they said, we want to be the first to interview you about, about this indictment, and I said, okay, you can do that, but first you gotta show me proof. A van pulls up, a woman gets out, and gives me a piece of paper, and it's a fax from the Miami Police Department, saying that they have someone in custody. - I'll still never forget the day, I got a phone call from Steve Moriarty, no hello, no nothing, we got him. (loud punk music) - This next chapter, in this awful story, I'm glad they finally caught this guy. It doesn't change anything about the band, and anything about the music we've made. - The key to the break in this case after 10 years? DNA evidence. - [News Reporter] 10 years ago, detectives saved some DNA evidence from the crime scene, and that finally led to an arrest in Florida. - Mia was viciously raped. There was no semen, but her attacker left saliva on her breast. And so we promptly reopened the case, and we started looking at the evidence, we said hey, we've got saliva samples, we sent the gauze in, and we were able to get a profile. - [News Reporter] Just one month ago, detectives finally got a computer hit. It led them across the country to Marathon, Florida, where last night, officers arrested this man, 48 year old Jesus Mezquia. He's a recently convicted Florida felon, whose profile was newly entered in a database. Suspect Jesus Mezquia was 39 years old when Mia Zapata was murdered. The investigation revealed he lived in Seattle at the time of the murder. Last month a DNA match was made, from the Florida felon database, from a newly entered profile. - This guy was an animal. He was the type of guy, that when he walked in a room, the temperature dropped about 10 degrees. He's big, he's got hands, I remember the hands, they're like, like baseball mitts. He's a predator. I'll go to my grave saying that they never met, till that night. - Nobody knew anything. Nobody knew this guy. We were on the wrong track the whole time. - [Detective] She was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and he was out, like a hunter trying to find game. - When it all came about, it was really a shock to everybody's system. - It was just like, whirlwind kind of, up down, like euphoric, like fucking piece of shit, is caught. - Seeing the man's face, for the first time was a truly evil experience. Like, the damn just broke. It was just like, oh my God, this is the last person that she saw? She was looking into this guy's eyes? - I just felt disgust and hate for the guy to the point that I pitied him, that I pitied him, that I hated him so much. - When we got back from Florida, my sergeant called me on the weekend, he said, could you call Richard Zapata? Tell him what's going on. And I called him, and I talked Rich for about a half hour. And I'll tell you what, through all this stuff, he's thanking us, he's telling me that you guys are saints for what you did, and I couldn't believe it. I thought Jesus, we did our job. And I remember walking down the stairs, and I was up in the bedroom talking, and I walked down the stairs, and my wife said, how'd it go? And I just started crying. I said, geez the guy's incredible, I can see why Mia was the way she was. - The time that it took to solve this case, to gather enough evidence to support charging, and hopefully a conviction later on, is how it tracked with the evolution of DNA itself. Because in the early 90s, DNA was just being ushered into the courtrooms, evidence such as saliva could not yield a result at that time. But then, some nine, 10 years later, the lab now is able to take a very small sample, and render a reliable result, and a genetic profile. The discoverer of that process received the Nobel Prize. - And I think, I wanted to be there, my sister wanted to be there, and my father, of course, was definitely gonna be there. But my mother, she had a tough time. She just really, I think she wanted to be there, but she just didn't feel like she could be. She felt like it would just hurt too much. She didn't want to have a face. She didn't want to know details. She didn't want to relive it. - The trial, it was different things, different people saw it differently. The people in Capital Hill, the music industry, it was their day, I mean it was finally redemption. It had really shaken up that community. It really hit 'em hard. And to them was almost like the day of deliverance. - [Bailiff] Please rise. - [Judge] Has the jury reached a verdict? - [Jury Foreman] Yes, Your Honor, we have. - [Judge] Would the clerk please read the verdict? - [Clerk] Verdict form A, we the jury, find the defendant, Jesus Mezquia, guilty of the crime of felony murder in the first degree, as alternatively charged in count one. Juror number one, is this your individual verdict? - [Juror Number One] Yes. - [Clerk] And is it the verdict of the jury? - [Juror Number One] Yes. - [Clerk] Juror number two, is this your individual verdict? - [Juror Number Two] Yes. - [Clerk] And is it the verdict of the jury? - [Juror Number Two] Yes. - [Clerk] Juror number three, is this your individual verdict? - [Juror Number Three] Yes. - [Clerk] And is it the verdict of the jury? - [Juror Number Three] Yes. - [Clerk] Juror number four, is this your individual verdict? - [Juror Number Four] Yes. - [Clerk] And is it the verdict of the jury? - [Juror Number Four] Yes. - [Clerk] Juror number five, is this your individual verdict? - [Juror Number Five] Yes. - [Clerk] And is it the verdict of the jury? - [Juror Number Five] Yes. - [Clerk] Juror number six, is this your individual verdict? - [Juror Number Six] Yes. - [Clerk] And is it the verdict of the jury? - [Juror Number Six] Yes. - [Clerk] Juror number seven, is this your individual verdict? - [Juror Number Seven] Yes. - [Clerk] And is it the verdict of the jury? - [Juror Number Seven] Yes.

You know, living with that on my mind for the last 12 years, and really not able to find any peace until, until I saw this day, and you know, I always held out hope that I would see this day, but sometimes I really didn't think so. - For a long time it's like, I haven't been able to listen to the Gits, because it was always so painful. After this happened and we were over there just the other night, and we put it on, and it was the first time, that I felt like, happy again. - I still love listening to our music, although it makes me sad, it makes me miss Mia. Their legacy is what it is, and it's seen differently by different people, but for me, it's just my personal memories of the time I spent with those guys. - It matters to me very much that people still care about the Gits, and the music especially. It's very moving when I hear that people care and that they get something from it, because after all, that's why we did it, to begin with. - We experienced a really dramatic, intense lives together. And we lost our sister together. We'll always be brothers. We'll live probably in different parts of the country, or different parts of the world, but there'll still be Gits. Just like Mia, will still be a Git. (rock music) ("Precious Blood" by The Gits) ♫ There are these things I want the most ♫ But they are usually one step furthest from my reach ♫ Oh, but they always stand close enough ♫ To take me to the next fuckin drink ♫ Cause when it cuts, it really does ♫ My soul spills the blood ♫ Don't know how long it's gonna take ♫ But I'm gonna need a little more one day ♫ Sometimes, I just want to know ♫ Faster than my precious blood will let me roll ♫ Is it real or, tell me, is it wrong ♫ To keep these dreams strongest in my mind ♫ Cause when it cuts, it just gets deeper baby ♫ Like when I go to touch you, ♫ You're the furthest from me ♫ Don't know how long it's gonna take ♫ But I'm gonna get me get me get a little more one day ♫ Oh, it's laying tired in me, it does ♫ And when I see it there it makes me wanna ♫ It's laying tired in me, it does, when I see it there ♫ It's all I can do to stare it in the face ♫ Just to get through this hell we made ♫ Even the hours they hold heavy on me ♫ Even the hours just hold the pain ♫ And even the times they get heavy, little weak ♫ Even the hours just hold the pain, there is no gain ♫ All in all it comes back to me ("Daily Bread" by The Gits) ♫ There's a motion in daily silence ♫ That's the yeses swimming round my head ♫ I need to listen to my conscience ♫ The world puts me down instead ♫ I have four walls and they're there to watch me ♫ The blankness jumps right off the page ♫ My fingers try to tear the paper ♫ A bitter moment is almost dead ♫ It's almost dead ♫ Come take my hand ♫ Thought I'd tell the bit of it ♫ And what makes sense ♫ And wait for all that I offer ♫ And they take my only bread ♫ And I leave another example of ♫ Well it leaves me, at about a thousand miles ♫ I feel the beating of the heartbreak ♫ I feel the beating of the sun ♫ And as I'm getting any closer ♫ Well I'm more than full of you ♫ In this place ♫ This hell ♫ Come take my hand ♫ Thought I'd tell the bit of it ♫ And what makes sense ♫ And wait for all that I offer ♫ And they take my only bread ♫ There's only so much I will take ♫ Bitterness is my rage ♫ And wait for all that I offer ♫ And they take my only bread ♫ Down ♫ Oh they're sending them down ♫ One by one they knock them over ♫ And they just sink down ♫ Suddenly down ♫ A simple down ♫ Let's all lay down - [Mia] Thank you. I think there are nice people here. (crowd cheering) (MultiCom Jingle)
