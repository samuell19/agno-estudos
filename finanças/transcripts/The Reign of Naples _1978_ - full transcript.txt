THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES Resistance begins in the South, with the "Four Days of Naples." Naples was the first city in Italy to liberate itself from Fascism. We are on a street near the port: Via Marinella. The area is full of buildings that are run-down or damaged from the bombing raids. It is home to the large families of men who have no steady jobs. It isn't born yet! Roberto, you have to calm down. Even if it is the first time your wife is expecting a child. Attorney, sir, you know my wife's state of health. I'm not worried about the pregnancy. I'm worried about the lack of care! Roberto, the French woman is there. She knows what she's doing. What help will the French woman be if there are complications? Roberto, you have to calm down. My God, your wife is in good hands. Rosario, the French woman, has a lot of experience. Come here. Mussolini! Mussolini! Everyone knows that the French woman, before she was a prostitute, was a nurse. Don't you worry! Show me! Did you listen to the radio? They said that the Germans have killed even more civilians. When will those bastards stop? How many innocent people must die before we get some peace again? Giuseppe, you have to calm down. These are the last skirmishes of a vanquished army. Come, let's have toast! You too. A toast to the health of the newborn. Cheers! Look! A daughter! It's a daughter! Vittoria! I'll name her Vittoria! Vittoria! We'll call her Vittoria! Congratulations! Have a drink! Congratulations to you too! How many more children should we have? A daughter! A daughter! - Congratulations! Congratulations! It's a girl! A girl! Congratulations! Congratulations! - A girl! Another girl! What idiots, these men. During the war, all they can make are girls. The Italian government is very active in the reconstruction of Naples. Some Neapolitans wish for the monarchy and the restoration of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Look at this! They left her alone in the stairwell. I'd better take her with me before she gets hurt. Come here, Darling! Maria, Vittoria is here. All alone on the stairs. Should I bring her up? My God, how heavy you are! At times I don't understand what's happening. What you see you can't believe, you just can't believe. A child is born. He is black and Mother calls him Ciro. It doesn't matter how you look at it. It doesn't matter if you call him Ciccio, Antonio, Peppe or Ciro. He's just black, as black as can be. The gossipmongers are talking about it. It's not that uncommon, you see such cases all the time. One glance was enough it seems, and the woman was done for. Yes, just one glance. Yes, just glanced back once. How can we now know who it was that hit the mark? He's just black, as black as can be. The farmer says, "Let's talk about it. Then we'll understand what happened. Wheat will grow were wheat is sown. Whether you like it or not: Wheat is all that will grow." Tell it to your mother, tell it to me too! Tell us what happened! Ciccio, Antonio, Peppe or Ciro: He's just black, as black as can be. Chocolate! Chocolate? Is it for me? What's that? For me? May I take it? And now? Eat? May I? I can eat it? For me? Tasty. That much? May I have another piece? For me? I don't understand you. Can't you speak Neapolitan? Me and you? Okay, me and you. And then? Tomorrow? Did you say "tomorrow"? Yes, tomorrow. Tomorrow! Okay, tomorrow. And then? Going for a walk? Now I understand. Tomorrow we're going to the sea. I have to ask Mother for permission. I can't come. I have to ask Mother first. I didn't understand that. You have to ask Mother. This flour isn't for my hunger. I don't eat spilled blood. But the children must eat. I'm not committing a sin. Dear William, you've been gone for five months now. Why don't you write me, and tell me how you're doing? Mother and I, we're always alone. But I am even more lonely, because Mother doesn't always treat me well. Do you love me? Rosa... Rosa! Come here and help me! A progressive economic model, which turned out to be extremely reactionary in nature. Free reign for the employer who exploits the workers. Repression and exploitation in the factories. Prime Minister De Gasperi seeks a closer alliance with the Vatican, and solicits the votes of the Catholics. The Pope also prays to the Holy Mother to bring about a miracle, so the people vote for the Christian Democrats. Go on! Slave away, you useless lowlifes! Don't you have anything better to do? What is it? Haven't you ever seen a pushcart before? What do you want? - You all haven't understood a thing! Palumbo, that jerk, he's doing a lot of damage! Now we're too poor for him, but when they bombed his house in '43, he asked us for help. Now he's gone running to the Christian Democrats. He's got a career and is working for them. Don't you get it? He only used us so the partisans wouldn't kill him! Shit! Why are you taking it out on the objects? You should throw him against the wall! Get out of here, will you! You're good for nothing! Get out of here! - I'll never forget you! I'll help you all! Help! We ran him out of town, him and his pushcart! Hey Roberto, you threw him out head over heels! I couldn't stop laughing. You got rid of that lout! Are you happy now? OPEN THE GRAVES AND THE DEAD WILL AWAKEN! GET OUT OF ITALY, GET OUT, FOREIGNERS! Come to Mommy. Don't always hang your head. Let me see how beautiful you are! Every man would be happy to marry a woman like you. Come, you must be patient. You'll still find one! Praise be to Jesus Christ! - Eternal praise! Amen. The atheists, the godless ones, eternally excommunicated, hiding behind their heretical image, hiding behind their bloodthirsty and cannibalistic Communism! They will soon be conquered, destroyed by the Catholic forces marching beneath the cross! Conquered and quashed like Satan, the seducer, under the heels of the immaculate Virgin Mary, Mother of Christ, our Redeemer and Savior. Take heed then. Do not be deceived by the words that glorify a false, new world! Devoid of spiritual values and without the solace of the Church. Those words come from the messenger of the Devil, who brings only chaos and destruction! Chaos into our Christian family. That's the one aim of this defamer of Jesus Christ and the Fatherland! But you, with your just and prudent votes, trusting in the cross and in Our Lord, you will succeed in defeating the Devil. Praise be to Jesus Christ! - Eternal praise! Amen. Pray! Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. If I don't do it tonight, my head will explode! Madonna! She sure has some legs! How much! 500 lire? Here you go. A Communist shouldn't do such a thing, but I have to feed them. American cigarettes. Of all things! Massimo, come wash your face! The Communists are excommunicated by the Pope. Maria Romana De Gasperi, daughter of the Christian Democrat Party Secretary: "To stop an armed underground movement, Father founded a small group of anti-communist partisans, headed by loyal officers of the state police force." Go on, shoot! Shoot! I'm fed up. I can't go on. Massimo is always on the street. That's where he's growing up. His father does nothing to send him to school. He thinks only of the Party. He doesn't think of his family. If only I... ... had stayed in Venice. Then my life wouldn't be so pathetic. Who would've thought that I would come to Naples, only to live like this. Go on, shoot! Mother! Mother! I'm coming, darling! Ever since we built that aquarium downstairs, you've been neglecting me. No, I'm just making sure the work is coming along. No, Mother, you're neglecting me. - But I've even given you money for that. You're right. Is my coffee ready? - Of course. And how did you prepare it? - Watery and sweet, just how you like it. I want to have a smoke. But don't say anything, Mother. Attorney, sir, want to buy this? Where did you get that? You stole it. Don't you know that even poor people can be honest? Indeed, they must be honest! Bring that cage back at once, and I'll give you a nice gift. Go! Right now! Massimo, come home soon! Come on, shoot! - Come on! Antonio! Go on, shoot! Look at these magnificent specimens! MOTHER AND FATHER, VOTE FOR ME To mark the Easter celebration, the Neapolitan newspaper "Roma" printed a photo from the Korean War, depicting a giant chocolate egg held in the hands of a Parisian child, next to the giant hand of an American soldier holding three grenades. Hail Mary... Sit. When you get up in the morning, you must wash your hands and face, and brush your teeth. Especially the teeth! If you brush your teeth, they will never fall out. Hygiene is important for everyone, rich or poor. You don't have to be rich to be clean. With a little soap and water, even the poor can be clean. Now let's see if your hands are clean. Stand up. Don't be like Vittoria, with her dirty fingernails, and dirty hands. Even her face is dirty! And this hair! Why don't you ever comb your hair? You stand right there! The laugh is always on the loser! In my family, nobody ever fell into the clutches of the nuns! Clutches! Don't exaggerate. Have you forgotten how grave our situation is? Our life is so miserable because we can hardly even write our names. Only education can help us out of our plight. But not with the nuns and priests! They ruin your mind instead of educating you! Not at that school! Never! Then which school should we send her to? And with what money? Don't you know that they give her breakfast and lunch there? Or should she end up like Massimo? Always on the street. Yes, I'm your wife. And I'm losing my authority. No. Vittoria has to go to school. She has to get out of these dregs! And if the nuns' school is the only way, then I assure you that you will not keep her from it! Massimo! Massimo! Here, Massimo, take this! Eat, children! Ciao, Massimo. Ciao. Now we can keep playing ball. Massimo! Wait, don't move! I'm coming. Massimo! You're dripping in sweat. I bet you haven't eaten since this morning. I've cooked something for you, only for you! Massimo, we have to go! - Be quiet! Quiet! Alessandro Simonetti, Spanish refugee and Franco opponent. He found himself in Naples, poor and lonely. But full of ideas to improve the people's future, and perhaps even his own. This miserable night was to be his downfall, but his unruly lips welcomed the break of dawn. They bound him, but he fights as a free soldier. They wounded him, but he teems with boundless strength. They chopped off his hands, but now they swing about. They buried him, only to find him singing with us again. In the 1953 parliamentary elections, the Christian Democrats get a boost in votes in southern Italy. A polio epidemic rages in Europe, especially in the South, due to the precarious hygienic conditions. Friends, this a day of joy! A few words for the bridal couple! Good luck! Good luck! Good luck! And plenty of male offspring! Congratulations! Congratulations! Isn't it a little late for children? - Nonsense, she'll just turn the clock back. She sure is brave. With such a big daughter... wearing a white dress for the second time. My children aren't ready yet. How's the wine? Like I just said, the wine is really good. Both in color and in taste. Exquisite! Then let us have a toast to everyone! To those who are here and those who are not! Cheers! Congratulations. - Speaking of those absent... I miss that black man she always took home. It was a long time ago. - Yes, I remember. Why aren't you eating? Comrade Valeria gave her consent to share her life with me. May the civil union we celebrate today herald the beginning of a new era, a time of great social prosperity for all comrades! Cheers! - Cheers! Good luck! Cheers! - Cheers! I'll take you to Ischia. I'll show you crazy things! You are so beautiful. Hey, Aunt, take it easy! Her there, for two years, every evening, she let Comrade Simonetti into her apartment. You two would've liked it too! What's he talking about? He has no idea. Hey, what's going on? It's Sophia Loren! Sophia Loren. Just who was missing! I don't care. You're more beautiful than Sophia Loren! I'll take you to Ischia, and then into bed, and then we'll get crazy! But you're the one I'm looking at. Move aside! Let her pass! The bride! Beautiful! Long live the bride! Get down! I can't stand seeing you anymore! Let me sing! - Get down! A snowfall in Naples brings traffic to a standstill. Many of the poor come close to freezing to death. Two thieves were arrested in a church. The Miracle of San Gennaro reoccurs at the wrong time of year. The coagulated blood in the monstrance turns red and becomes fluid. Mother always spoke of it. Who knows, maybe I will find my peace here. Peace and salvation. What is it, my child? Why are you so despondent? What has happened? Speak. - Mother, I am unhappy. I don't want to live among people anymore. I want to stay here. I want to be like you. Dear child, you are too young. I will talk to your father and pray to God. Let us trust in divine providence. Come, let us go to your house. You will go to school now! I'll do what I want! You haven't amounted to anything either. I want to work, I want to make money! You'll go to school! Understand? Or I will break your bones! You go to school, okay? Are you going to go, or not? Massimo! I'm talking to you! Hey! Massimo, if you don't go to school, I'll beat you to a pulp! Now do you get it? You will do as I say. Look at me, Massimo. Look at me. Eat. Boy, I'm your father, and you'll do as I say. Understand? Now what? Won't you finish eating? Eat, Massimo. Hey! Massimo, now eat! Praise be to Jesus Christ. Your daughter wants to follow her calling. Do you give your permission? - A nun, in my house? Hail Mary, full of... Leave! I won't have you here, not even as a corpse! Don't ever do that again. I'll be right back. Do your homework. Let's go. May I play? - Sit down. Poor Rosa, she's so young. She's always so serious, as if something bad happened to her. I don't know why she doesn't find a man. Vittoria, how beautiful she is. And she wanted to go to the nunnery. The only good thing my father ever did. He stopped her from doing something stupid. I'm so fed up! I don't want to live like this anymore! I'll go to Mr. Simonetti. He'll surely help me. All I want is to work. Then I'll show my dad. Good day, Mr. Simonetti. May I? Come on in. How are you? How I am? Well, I'm here. Father is always the same. Yes, I know. I know everything. I've decided to help you. Thank you, Mr. Simonetti. Our country's situation is very grave. Corruption is eating up everything we have. I know. You're still a child. And you feel the need to work and to earn money. If we don't all stick together under the protection of the Party, we'll never manage to do away with the cronyism of the Mafia. You can stay here, with us. You will keep the Party headquarters clean, and sell the Party paper. We'll either pay very little, or nothing at all. But in a few years, things will change, and there will be work for everybody. So if you agree, give me your hand, and we'll be on a first-name basis. Call me Comrade Simonetti! 1200 American tourists arrive in Italy on the luxury cruise ship "Colombo." Cuba declares a state of siege. The war in Indonesia is not over yet. Unita! Unita! Unita! Are you the French woman? Are you the French woman? UNITY. I knew it! If I don't check on them, they don't work! I always have to play the boss! Gennaro, listen to me! - Yes, boss, what is it? Will we make it by Saturday? It would be the third time that I embarrass myself with a late shipment. Answer me! - What can we do? We don't have the material. The material! The material! Go on. You just don't feel like working! Get back to work! Go on! Look at what you're doing! I'd never be willing to do that! Did it take the Party to turn you into a housewife? You're my brother. You're a Neapolitan. You're almost a man. Don't you know that cleaning is no business for men? Stupid girl. It's the only job they pay a regular wage for. And I've met the most important Party representatives here. I'm making progress. This trash is for you! Go on up. I have something to take care of. Tell Father I'll be up later. Okay. Ciao. French woman! Hey, French woman! You've brought me a business partner. That will be 2000 lire, my boy. She's supposed to be beautiful? - She's French. I don't like her. - Hey, handsome! You're handsome. Believe me, two fresh eggs and a lot of sugar can wake the dead. You always exaggerate. Me? And you always cover your eyes so you don't see the truth. So how does it taste, Massimo? Vittoria, for you too. Rosa, you had some already. Do you want some more? Wake up, Rosa! - Yes, in a moment. Valeria, tell me, where did you get the sugar? I've been all over Naples, and I couldn't even find one spoonful! Because you don't buy on the black market like my wife does. Our newspaper calls it hoarding, and demands that we denounce these parasites. But not everybody has a collective conscience. Right, Valeria? - No, I just happened to be in Forcella, and they offered me 10 kg of sugar. Right, Massimo? You were there. - We bought 10 kg of sugar and 20 eggs. You will never have a political conscience! You'll always stay the same. Just remember: as long as you ignore the public displays of violence, there is hardly hope for an improvement of social conditions. BANCA D'ITALIA TEN THOUSAND LIRE In Naples, 13 million lire of counterfeit money is confiscated. A scandal erupts and quickly spreads. Come in! Close the door! That noise is driving me crazy! Who is it? Oh, hello. It's you. Come in. You're frightened, aren't you? They drive me crazy. How pretty you've become. Come here! I still have to write something. Come here. Have a seat! In my chair. The executive chair. I'll be done in a moment. There! You pretty girl! You see, Vittoria, you're now 16 years old and very cute. But what good does that do you? Where you are now, you'll never find a good husband. Can your father give you a dowry? A bridal gown? You have to think of yourself. It's finally time to think of yourself! Or else you'll remain an old maid, like all the others. Like Rosa, or whatever her name is. - Yes, her name is Rosa. But I like her a lot. She's always helped all of us. Always. Yes. Yes, of course. I just want the best for you. What good did it do Rosa? Her mother married again, and since then she has never had another man. And you know well how horrible our men are. Even though they don't lead a chaste life. That's why we women have to be careful. Understand? Now let's get to the point. I have an apartment above the factory. I need someone, someone to keep it clean. You could have a room all to yourself. I could pay you more than your wage in the factory. That way you could meet respectable people. My friends. The relatives I invite to the apartment. Only first-class people. A big opportunity for you. Do you know why I am doing this? Because I like you. I like you a lot. That's it. That awful noise! If you like, don't talk too much about this at home. Pack your things and come back tomorrow morning. All right? Drink. Drink. Go on! Drink! Do we agree? Give me your hand! Do you want a nice gift? Something feminine? Now go back to work. That noise! That noise! That noise! That noise! Massimo! Get up and wash your face! You've made up your mind to move in with Ferrante? Yes! Don't try to talk me out of it. I've made up my mind. Don't you see that people like Ferrante exploit us? That they only pay us a pittance? Those capitalist pigs! Knock it off! Maybe she's right. What can she expect of us? Ciao, Massimo. I'm sure she'll bring us something nice every day. What is it? You're leaving already? The other times, I had to chase you off. Now that you've slept with me, you're running off? It's late, I have to go home. Why so serious? Are you mad at me? - No, no. Don't lie. I've known you since you were born. I nearly raised you. Was the first time disappointing for you? Yes. - Why? Why? You treated me like a john. You know why I came to you. You treated me like just some guy! You neither kissed me nor embraced me. You treated me like all the others. You're in love! You're jealous! It has nothing to do with jealousy. - I get it. So it's about money. Money? Nonsense. - Yes, money. I only took it because you insisted. I love you! Don't cry. You're young. You have the light. I'm hidden in the darkness. Darker and darker, older and older. The darkness! The darkness! The darkness. What are you looking at? Go faster! Faster! We're late with the shipments! Don't you people understand? My aunt was right. You really are a pretty girl. I have a present for you. Baci Perugina. You can't afford much, with the pittance my aunt pays you. Are you crazy, girl? That's why you're here. Come here. I'm sure we'll get along. I don't want to hurt you. Now I get it. That's why she wanted me here. Fuck off! I don't want to see you here again! Understand, asshole? Find yourself another job! Pick up your things tomorrow! You'll find it all in the trash! Why? Why did you leave me? What torment! Without your help it's all so much harder! What should I do without you? What a disappointment. How sickening! How revolting! Mrs. Ferrante isn't as honest as she claimed! She only wants to make a whore out of me! I swear to you, Mother! I swear to you that I will never do that! Never! Come on. There you go again. You stubborn ass! It was late because we were discussing the new congress with the Party. Sure, the congress. The Party. You always have excuses, just so you can do whatever you want. My things are in Ferrante's apartment. Get them. People expect salvation from Kennedy. Even Vittoria, who wanted to be a nun, is pro-American now. Just look! I haven't had work in two years, and she wants to know what I do for work. The only job was the one Mrs. Ferrante offered me. She wanted to make a prostitute out of me. Don't take my picture. I'm no diva. Take a picture of me too. - Please. The pictures are important for the survey. Now please tell me if you're married, and what your job is. I'm single and unemployed. Continuing with our survey on women's employment, have you ever had a job before? Please tell us about that job, and why you quit. Did you have a better opportunity, perhaps? The boss hasn't paid us in five weeks! You're right! We can't go on like this. I'm spending money I don't even have. If you all agree, we'll go up to the boss! And we'll get our money, by force, if need be! Come on! What are you standing around for? Let's go! Hurry! We want our money! You haven't paid us in five weeks. And I haven't eaten in a week. - You haven't paid in five weeks! And all I have are more debts. I have no income. Big industry... Big industry has ruined small industry. I want my money! We did our work! It's our right! The workers are here too! That's right. He's right. Then... ... I'll take the money out of my rent. It's over there, next to the Madonna. What is this? Who is this for? It's not even enough for one of us! Madam, we want our money! If you don't pay, we won't leave! Gennaro is right. Who shot the gun? Who shot the gun? Who shot the gun? Murderer! Murderer! Help! Help! There is no trace of Mrs. Ferrante and her daughter. The workers never got their money. And poor Don Gennaro had to die. He left behind a wife and children in abject poverty. You know how it is. These are difficult times. Everything is complicated now. They killed Comrade Gennaro because he was defending his rights. Unbelievable. Right now, Massimo, we have to stick together. What are the politicians doing? Sleeping? No, they're wide awake. They're just pretending to sleep. They don't care if Comrade Gennaro was barbarously murdered. Now they're all preoccupied with giving President Kennedy a warm welcome. President Kennedy is a friend of Italy. - You're mistaken. Kennedy is an imperialist. An imperialist and a colonialist. There's a woman standing out here whom I don't know. Let her in. Good day. What can I do for you? Good day, Attorney, sir. - Have a seat. What can I offer you? - Nothing. I don't want anything. My female sense of curiosity has led me here. Your message. What is the significance of this "unpostponable decision"? Valeria, you know... And it's obvious... I'm no longer the youngest. And my mother, bless her soul, she's been in Heaven for two years now. And I'm alone. I'm alone. So... You understand. - Attorney, sir! Are you crazy? You're alone, and I'm to comfort you? I'm a married, respectable woman! - But no! I'm talking about your daughter Rosa. If you like, you could talk to her. You could persuade her. And we will be honorably married. She will live the life of a lady. And you too. As my mother-in-law, you will want for nothing. We shall see. Close your eyes! I've bought something nice that will bring good fortune to everyone. That's Kennedy, the American president! You bring an imperialist and colonialist into our house? Comrade Simonetti says so too! - Now you listen to me. I have a job as a waitress in a hotel by the sea. Father has no money. And you? What do you do? You earn a couple of cents with your Party. I'm the only one working hard around here. And I'm not even allowed to hang Kennedy's portrait on the wall? You know what? I'm going to put this here too. I know. It's my fault. But I also know there's no point. But the most important thing is that you have a secure existence. Attorney Palumbo has a career. He's a big shot with the Christian Democrats. He loves you. He showers you with gifts. He throws himself at your feet! He has lots of money! And everything can change for us! Don't you see how we live? If it were up to your father, we would just survive on bread and the Party. We could have a secure life. Rosa! Are we to live in this poverty forever? Speak! Speak, my darling. Let me hear your voice. You know what? You were always a piece of filth, and you will always be one! Don't ever try that again! Understand? You've ruined my life, you whore! Why? Why? Why must I always pay for all of you? You're right. Michelangelo's 'Pieta' goes to the United States. Doctor! Oh, it's you. Doctor, please hurry! Doctor! Doctor! What should we do? You know I am prepared to do anything. I'm not worried about the sickness. The tetracyclines are the problem. It's impossible to get them here. Doctor, speak clearly! Without using such difficult words. What are you talking about? You know I'm prepared to do anything. Tetracyclines are the only medication that can save your daughter! They are impossible to buy! - Write it down! I'll take care of it! Doctor, hurry. Doctor! Faster, doctor! How is she doing? Just look! Great communists you are, you and my husband. The Americans send no penicillin, and you do nothing! Go to your Party and tell them that I scoured every pharmacy. In vain! Now you have to do something. Go! Go! Just go, already! Get out! Comrade Pagani, stop. I already told you that Comrade Simonetti received an urgent call, and didn't say where he was going. We're broadcasting directly from the Port of Naples. As we speak, the operation begins to load Michelangelo's "Pieta" aboard the "Christopher Columbus." The masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance will be exhibited in various American cities, giving the American people the chance to admire it in all of its sculptural perfection. Comrades! The times are worse than people think! The economic boom continues to enrich only the property owners! This prosperity, unfortunately, does not benefit us! This prosperity, unfortunately, does not benefit us! More and more, we are exploited and marginalized! We must be aware of this situation and demand respect for our rights! ... and demand respect for our rights! Only a total strike can force those who exploit us... Only a total strike can force those who exploit us to accept our demands to restore our employment contracts! Bravo! Murderer! It's over! It's over! It's over! Murderer! He's dead. VOTE, EVEN IF IT RAINS! Valeria Cavioli Simonetti received quite a mild sentence, due to mitigating circumstances. She is now a patient in an insane asylum. It's not about forgiveness, it's about having pity on a poor woman who will spend the rest of her life in an asylum. I'm against the death penalty too. I'm just angry about our miserable situation. Misery all over, and people only think about nonsense. Stop. Go on. Hello, Valeria. In 1939, four young men invited me to the cinema. Rosa was already born, my husband was at work. I had no money, so I went along with them. All four of them had their way with me, I still remember it well. Then I passed out. When I woke up I was in the hospital. One of them probably laid me out in front of the door and then took off. My husband, who later died in prison, then beat me for two days straight. At our house, on Via Marinella, Schiavetta stole everything two months later. I turn and turn. Now that you've seen Valeria, you can understand the sadness of our community. Mother and Comrade Simonetti are dead. Attorney Palumbo first pounced on us, only to then embrace the Church and the Christian Democrats. Rosa died due to complications from her pneumonia, and Mrs. Cavioli is in the insane asylum. What happens when the few cents you get from the Party are no longer enough? If you decide to start a family sometime? What then? Do you want your children to live like you and I? Your wife will ruin her back and curse the day she met you. Massimo, open your eyes! Don't be a dreamer all your life! Vittoria, you're right, but I still believe in the Party. Comrade Simonetti's death must not be in vain. What, are you angry with me now too? What about Rosaria? Is she still "nice" to you? Nonsense! Rosaria has grown old. She can hardly stand up straight anymore. - Liar. Even in Naples, a process of political sensitization seems to have taken hold, following on the heels of a movement of international consciousness. Always me. Father no longer has enough strength to do anything. Cleaning, ironing, washing... My life doesn't end here. I can't give up. To change my life, I have to continue my education. I have to study. I know how important languages are. In the hotel, everything is fine. I have enough to eat and a roof over my head. And if I see someone I like... Why not? I refuse to end up like my mother, who worked herself to death for husband and children. Only Massimo breaks my heart. He's my brother. I love him. I have to help him. I noticed you yesterday already. You are truly beautiful. Why don't you come up to my room, where we can have a drink and talk? I recognize you! But you don't remember. No matter how distinguished you act, you will always be the cursed nephew of Ferrante, that damned murderer. You better leave if you don't want any trouble. I'm not a child anymore! VOTE COMMUNIST Ho Chi Minh! Ho Chi Minh! Is he home? You're under arrest! Do you have an arrest warrant? - We don't need one! Let me go! Massimo, stay calm! Massimo! You bastards! Let's go! Let him go, you jerk! Help! Help! We have returned to a climate of uncertainty. Massimo has served his prison sentence. Will he still be a dreamer? Brother, can I have a drag? - This is the last time, man. Father! Father! All right. Here it is. Vittoria. Tell me one thing. Even though nobody listens to me. Vittoria, come here. - Yes. What's wrong, Father? - Why don't you find a husband, instead of always spending time with books? You're so beautiful. You're sure to find a good husband. If you want to. Father... I decided a long time ago never to get married. I swore it to myself. I can support myself without a husband. My job is enough. You should take care of Massimo. He's been in jail for two years now. We can't do anything to get him out of there. Vittoria, you know I never understood a thing about bureaucracy. You do it. Help Massimo. I'll stay here. And wait. I feel like a new man. BEWARE OF DOG With so much sulphur in the air, people are destined to die. They dig from morning to evening in this filth. And the work robs you of all joy. What kind of a life is that? Comrade Simonetti always said that things would change. But too much time has passed, and we're doing worse than ever. I feel so lonely. I used to have my sister, but she's gone too. I don't think she's happy, despite her stewardess uniform. She's no longer the same. I feel like drowning myself, plunging my head into this ocean of oil. Despite the general climate of uncertainty, the horizon seems to be widening. Perhaps there are prospects for change. 1, 2, 3, 4, we want work! 5, 6, 7, 8, or there will be trouble! 1, 2, 3, 4, we want work! 5, 6, 7, 8, or there will be trouble! 1, 2, 3, 4, we want work! THE STUDENT MOVEMENT SUPPORTS THE ORGANIZED UNEMPLOYED Prison opened my mind. We'll see whether I can assert myself. I have to show them. I have to be triumphant. The Party has to do something for me. I was just a boy when I introduced myself at the local Party office. I started working here with you, doing the lowliest jobs, always hoping for the Party's great success. Now the moment has come: I have a wife and a child. I need security. I need certainty. Now you have to help me. We understand, Massimo. That's why we've decided to help you. At Alfasud, they need untrained workers. Don't you worry. You have very good chances. I have to be triumphant. The Party has to do something for me. Hey, French woman! It's me, Massimo! You look sick. Stop. Lean up against here! What is it? French woman! Help! Help! French woman! THE END
