This programme contains very strong language BIRDSONG HE IMITATES PLANE HE PUFFS HE PUFFS The house I live in is an island. My dad says we're trapped. He says we have to wait. Sometimes, when I'm gazing up at the sky, I think about stuff. Strange stuff. I think about God. My dad tells me that there ain't such a thing as a God. But looking up at the sky, I wonder... ..what if those clouds suddenly stopped? My dad tells me that time will stop soon enough. For everything... and everyone. My dad is a clever individual. He taught me how to read and write. Now he's teaching me how to shoot a shotgun. He says a man who can read and write... ..and kill... ..has got it all. HE PANTS GUNSHOTS GUNSHOTS PLANE RUMBLES GUNSHOT TV STATIC AND MUFFLED SPEECH TVS BLARE We've had so many things happen, so many unusual things happen. We decided to have a 24-hour test warning. We wanted to hear what God had done in the lives of people in the last 24 hours. I remember one lady who came and stood in front of the church. She had a little baby in one arm. TVS BLARE ..and she said today, "I want to ask forgiveness from the woman "whose husband I stole three years ago, "and now I'm asking the church to forgive me." TVS BLARE ..just for the express purpose of clearing her conscious... TVS BLARE ..they can be prepared hundreds of different ways, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as for snacks. Eggs can be served in more ways than any other food. There's no better looking, better tasting menu item than the incredible edible egg. In the next few minutes, and with the help of Bill here, our cook, I'm going to pass along some pointers on eggs. HE SMACKS LIPS: Ahh. I had a dream last night. I dreamt about two individuals... ..who thought they could help each other. That... That strength... ..eradicated their weaknesses. And to an extent, they were right. That is, an individual with no arms... ..carried on his back an individual with no legs. Now, I can see how this might have worked. The man with no legs could now kick a ball... ..and the man with no arms could now build stuff with his hands. Stuff like a chair. This might have made both individuals happy. But it didn't. The man with legs grew tired of football. He had himself two left feet. The man with arms... ..couldn't do jack shit with his hands. Each time they'd sit on the chair, each time it did collapse. So they began to bicker and blame the other. One would threaten to punch, while the other threatened to kick. Really? You dreamt that? Yep. I did. And it don't take no dream to imagine how brutal the fight was. It was an explosion of fucking frustration. They smashed into furniture. They crashed through the windows and thumped to the ground. They tumbled and rolled across the dirt. Until they were forcefully separated. Bloody and bruised. - HE WHISPERS: - Forever. # Now every year about July... # GEESE HONK # ..but here's the kind of exercise that I enjoy the best # When I go swimmin'... # # I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy Down in my heart # Down in my heart Down in my heart # I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy # Down in my heart # Down in my heart to stay # And I'm so happy So very happy # I've got the love of Jesus in my heart # And I'm so happy So very happy # I've got the love of Jesus in my heart # I've got the peace that passes understanding down in my heart # Down in my heart Down in my heart # I've got the peace that passes understanding... # Fuck me, Charlie, you've aged. Well, it has been 15 years, sir. Hello, Charlie. Hello, Miss. You know me, Charlie. I tend not to take delight in the sufferings of others. But with that man, that... ..motherfucker... I've experienced pleasure like you wouldn't believe. I've stabbed him in the face with a 12-inch blade. I've drawn and quartered him and hung him from a tree. I've doused him in acid. I've pounded his skull with a lump hammer. I've set him alight and listened while his hair singed and his skin crackled. I've ended his life 100 ways, Charlie. But, finally, I've got to admit... ..I ain't got the strength for it no more, Charlie. I just ain't. So, I'm simply going to have to settle for putting a bullet through his fucking brain. Well, it ain't going to be easy. Nothing ever is. OK. I'll keep in touch by Morse. Good.

She was built like a whippet, too. I think it'll only work... ..if he's on his own. If he's on his own, I can snatch him. And if he ain't? Then that's a problem. Then we wait. He don't know we're here. And the boy won't know we exist. We got time. Ain't blowing you off course, is it, seeing him? You think that was him? I think it was. He's flesh and blood. I could sense it. JAUNTY MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO Bringing home a stray cat was a bad idea, boy. Was a mistake. I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say to a girl... ..you know... I could say you've got pretty eyes and pretty legs and pretty feet. But, I mean, it's nothing, so... It's what they call, you know, superficial. A superficial girl... ..she'd like me to say them things to her, but... ..I can see in your eyes that you ain't a superficial girl, so... So what I would say is... ..I like being in your company. Um... I like, you know... I mean... I-I like the way we're sitting, you know, here and... ..looking at things and... ..or looking at each other. You know, cos I-I think... ..I think we share something, you know. Something that's not superficial. You know, something that makes us... ..you know, makes us closer together. Um, and when we are together, I... ..I'd like to take your hand. And then... ..some day... ..if you wouldn't mind... ..if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to kiss you. That's what I'd say. Psst. - HE WHISPERS: - Where are you hiding? Time to come out and see the light. That is, if you're not afraid. You're afraid you'll see something you don't like? Woo-hee! Ain't you a pretty little thing? Pretty as a picture. Going to catch you a cute kitten tonight, I expect. A fine tom cat like you takes what he wants, those fucking idiots won't know what hit them.

HE SNORES GENTLY HEARTBEATS MAN CRIES OUT AND GROANS HE WHIMPERS I apologise. For what I just did. I'm not dismissing my actions... ..but things ain't what they appear to be. I-I know what it is you do. Um, I... I know why we move from place to place. Do you? But you don't know the reasons... ..why I do what you think I do. Knowing that is knowing something that I don't know. You think cos you speak in a riddle it'll get you out of a hole? A whole lot of trouble. No. HE WHISPERS: No, no. That ain't no excuse. That ain't no excuse for saying you don't know why you do what you do. I ain't stupid. I know that. And I know that you are a young man. But men make mistakes. Please be very careful who you choose to trust. I'll speak clearer in the morning. After a good night's sleep. Sleep? I never go to sleep. HATCH OPENS AND CREAKS I don't make the decisions. I don't decide this or decide that. I don't decide who gets to go and who gets to stay. Those decisions are made by somebody who don't give a shit. Some say it's God. Some say it's the devil. It don't matter. Neither give a shit. So I apologise... ..cos I can't rectify those decisions. I'm stuck with the sight of you. I mean... I've only known what to say to a girl just the once before. That one time. I walked up to her. And I said... "..On the surface... "..I might do despicable acts... "..but underneath... "..I despise those acts. "..On the surface, I'm clinical. "..Underneath, I am rotten." I didn't really say that. I couldn't. So instead... ..I spoke another truth. I told her... - HE WHISPERS: - "You are by far the prettiest girl I have ever seen." Now... ..I know for certain that... ..she will have had that pointed out to her... ..on a thousand occasions... ..and each and every one of those thousand must have had but one intention. Why she accepted my offer of a dance... ..I do not know. I also had that intention. That and a... ..thousand other intentions.

WHIRRING CLICKING STATIC - RECORDER: - Testing. CLICKING Test-ing. CLICKING THUD SHE GIGGLES FLIES BUZZING FLIES BUZZING HE BREATHES HEAVILY When I was, um, a little boy... ..my folks, they bought me two tortoises. Michelle and Mr Gonzales. Michelle as in "my shell" and... ..Mr Gonzales as in that speedy motherfucking mouse. My folks... ..they were concerned that I seemed to be... ..locked inside my own head. And, uh, they thought that maybe having a couple of companions during the summer might be a good thing. And they... They were right, it was. I built them a little... ..obstacle course to keep them fit. I built them dens in the garden, too, so they could hide, you know? Each day after school I would, uh... ..go and check in on them to make sure everything was OK. And, uh... ..soon autumn arrived and... ..it was starting to get cold outside. Um... I was worried that they would die during the winter. So I suggested to my parents... ..that I could keep them warm and offer shelter in my bedroom. And they would have all the food they need... ..that outside they'd freeze to death. And freeze to death they did. I finally found one of them on Boxing Day. I'm still not quite sure which one it was because... ..well, I couldn't see his face. His head was gone. All that was left... ..was his shell. So...I buried him. One foot underground. And I wanted him to go heavenwards so I took two twigs and... ..put them in the shape of a cross, on a small amount of dirt. And I says a little prayer. I pictured... I pictured him waking up, being a little disorientated, you know? Being a little confused. And I pictured him starting to panic manically, scratching at the dirt, his little heart pounding like a jackhammer. He must have been shit-scared. He must have been screaming. I never heard those cries for help. Never. And I learned a lesson that day. And I never made that mistake again. I did hear her cries. I was there, Bill. I did attempt to ease her pain. I did comfort her... ..and soothe her. She was ours. KETTLE WHISTLES Bill, would you give your wife some tea for me, please? WOOD SCRAPES Drink. WOOD SCRAPES Bill. - WOMAN: - This is me. Hello. And that's him. - MAN: - Hello. BABY GURGLES And you... Ah, that's you. - Now, we - that's me, hello, and him... - Hello. ..well, we were wondering, if you wouldn't mind, if it's not too much of an inconvenience... BABY GURGLES ..we were thinking, me and him, that maybe the three of us could come to some type of agreement or a verbal contract about a proposal we'd like to propose. The proposition would be this. In exchange for certain pleasures bestowed upon me, that me and him could get... BABY GURGLES AND THEY BOTH GIGGLE ..Could get... Oh, I'm so sorry! That me and him could get some sleep. Excellent. Now, we are quite happy to negotiate. We were hoping, though, that in exchange for five hours of sleep... BABY GURGLES Four hours, four? In exchange for a catnap, that him... Hello. THEY BOTH LAUGH ..would make sure that you've got plenty of talcum powder on your bright pink arse, and me, hello, - would make sure that, ooh, sweet coconut oil shampoo... - Mm-hm. ..is used on your pretty little head. Oh, that is correct! So... do we have a deal? Mwah! Sealed with a kiss!
