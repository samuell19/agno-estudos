LUMINOUS MOSS Produced by: Taketoshi Naito, Toru Aizawa Original Novel: Tat jun Takeda Written by: Taruo lkeda, Kei Kumai Cinematography: Masao Tochizawa Art Direction: Takeo Kimura Music: Teizo Matsumura Editing: Osamu Inoue Cast: Rentaro Mikuni Eiji Okuda Hisashi Igawa Taketoshi Naito Tetta Sugimoto Masane Tsukayama Kunie Tanaka Chishu Ryu Directed by: Kei Kumai In autumn that year, a research trip for my novel took me to Shiretoko Peninsula, the easternmost tip of Hokkaido. Can you see? - That's Kunashiri Island. - Oh, that's it. The media's making a fuss over its occupation. - But it's quiet here. - Indeed it is. | don't know this area, so I appreciate your guiding me. Not at all. I've been a fan of your novels for some time. - I always wanted to meet you. - Thank you. - This is a great opportunity. - Thank you. Where are we going today? We'll go to Point Pekin, to see the luminous moss. Luminous moss? So, this road was built after the last war? That's right. Only small boats could go further than this. This is our National Treasure. Until the last war, the sea came up to here. Is that s0? Until 5,000 years ago, in the mid-Jomon Period, many people lived here. The luminous moss grows inside this cave, but I can't see any. - Can you? -No, I can't. That's strange. There, I see it. Where is it? You can see it from this angle. Yes, only from a certain angle. | can see the illumination only when I don't look at it. Thank you. It really is quiet here. Perhaps it's the season. Now is the quietest time of the year. But winter's very severe here. The drift ice used to cut off access to that cave. There was a strange atmosphere in that cave. It's not that the moss emits light, but rather, the moss itself becomes the light. Instead of emitting light, it seemed to draw light into itself. I've never seen a cave like that. As a matter of fact, | always wanted to take you there. Why is that? This is a history of Rausu. It includes a summary of an incident. Have a look. It occurred on the morning of December 3rd, 1943, A fleet of six ships from the Merchant Marine... left Nemuro for the port of Otaru. While the fleet was passing Rausu, It ran into a blizzard. But it was determined to accomplish its mission, and continued its journey to Cape Shiretoko. However, the Seishin Maru V, the ship in question, suddenly experienced engine trouble, and was wrecked off Point Pekin. One of the crew tied a rope around himself, jumped into the sea and swam to Tengu Rock. So the Captain and other crew also made it to the shore. Of course, I don't know how they lived in the cave for the next three months. The only crewman who made it back to Rausu was the Captain of the ship. He left the cave and crossed over the drift ice. He said he'd gambled his life on it. Quite incredible, wasn't he? At last, he found his way to a fisherman's house in the village of Rusha, 21 kilometres north of Rausu. It was during the war, so the Captain's actions were considered heroic, and the whole village was told about It. Our heroic Captain! You had a courageous narrow escape from the freezing battlefield of the northern sea. We, the pupils of Rausu National School, praise your heroic deed, and are inspired to work harder for our country, and for the sake of His Majesty the Emperor. Banzai! Banzai! - Banzail - Banzai! - Banzai! - Banzai! The Merchant Marine sent out a search party, but the bad weather made it difficult. They only managed to recover three bodies from the sea, and then the search was called off. However, in summer that year... The Captain openly admitted that they were the bones of a crewman called Nishikawa. So, of the seven men, only you and Nishikawa got to the cave. Is that right? And how did you survive once you made it to the cave? | suspect that the Captain lied to the police. - Why's that? - There's one thing. Although he said they survived by catching seals for food, from December to February, seals don't come to this area. Furthermore, | suspect that the Captain killed Nishikawa to eat him. Unless one thinks that way, it doesn't make sense. | see. By the way, why did you tell me this story? Actually, I wrote this history of Rausu on my return from the POW. Camp in Siberia. As my research into the incident continued, - I became rather perplexed. - Perplexed? Because of my experience in Siberia, | began to empathise with the Captain. - Which part of Siberia were you in? - Well. | felled trees for three years near Taishet. Please. I'm sorry. Hey. Hey! | became fascinated by the headmaster's pursuit of the story over so many years. It seemed as if the Captain's spirit from over 40 years ago possessed the headmaster. And now, that same spirit, was speaking to me through the headmaster. What did happen to the crew that drifted ashore to the cave on Point Pekin? What did the Captain think in that cave and what did he do? | pondered these questions as the night slipped away. Hey! Take off all your clothes, or you'll freeze to death. Hurry up! Captain! Courage, Gosuke! Gosuke! Keep up your spirit! We're here. Near Point Pekin. Rausu is 40 kilometres away. We can't possibly walk back there. | wonder if we're the only ones to suffer this fate. After all, there were six ships. Ours couldn't have been the only one wrecked. If we are the only ones who ended up like this, that's too unfair, isn't it? Perhaps we are the only ones. In that case, it's hopeless. - It's hopeless in any case. - Right. - We're hungry in any case. - Right. We're hungry in any case. Nishikawa, you're working hard. Hey, Nishikawa. Nishikawa! Making a harpoon head with seal bones is a very clever idea. But what do you mean to catch with that? Seals and fish don't come anywhere near the beach. I'm dizzy from hunger without doing anything. How can you do such fine work, knowing it's all useless? Nishikawa/ Hurry up and finish the harpoon. - And feed me with a whale! - Just leave him alone. Whatever we do, there's no way we can survive. Right. Without food, people die. - It's always like that. - Stop that! It's no use complaining. Look at our Captain. He never utters a word of complaint. Don't you remember that we're on a mission? Listen. Don't you realise we have a duty to the army? Yeah... Duty to the army. Why don't you live up to it?! - How can you fulfil your duty?! - Hey, Nishikawa You sound gallant, but you're wobbly on your legs. | would persevere in the sacred war. If only I could, | would persevere any time. Yeah, you talk like our Fleet Commander. But, Nishikawa. Even if the Commander or the General was here, what could they do? We don't belong to the Commander, we belong to the Emperor! The Emperor? What about him? Wouldn't he feel hunger when he's starving? Bring the Emperor to this cave, if you can. Gosuke. Don't be so cruel. What would you do with him? Bring him here. And keep him here, 10 or 20 days. Bastard! - Come here! - Nishikawa! Hey, stop that. If you don't stop, you'll both die. | don't think Gosuke or | did anything to upset Nishikawa so much. We're only saying, we'll get hungry if we don't eat. - That upset him. - Then what can I say? You must say you won't starve or die, even if you don't eat. | don't like lying. It's painful to lie all the time. Well, what can I talk about? Have you eaten a dish that the Ainu cook? It's called fuibe. Fuibe... They cut a seal, take out its insides. The stomach, the liver, the lungs and all. - And chop them up very finely. - Idiot! And put them in a pot. The whiskers. The brains, too. And stir the pot. Eat this, Gosuke. Eat it. It's yummy Eat! There's nothing in the world so yummy, That's right. - There's nothing so yummy:. - Eat, Nishikawa. Nishikawa, stop sulking and eat. It's yummy! - Gosuke, what's wrong? - Gosuke. - Does your stomach hurt? - Be strong! Is the pain really bad? It can't be! You're not going to die, are you? Something's wrong with him. - Is he all right? - Don't worry. Serves him right for swallowing sea water. He won't die. | won't die yet. That's what I just said. You won't die yet. Then, when am I going to die? How would I know that? But you won't die yet. Not today. - Will I die tomorrow? - Gosuke. When you die, we'll all die. Be strong and endure the pain. Nishikawa's right. You won't be the only one who's going to die. | don't want to die! Right. If we died in a place like this, it'd be a waste. | don't want to die in war, either! Don't worry, Gosuke. We're safe from the war in this place. There's no enemy around here to kill us. | don't... I don't... want to die with you, either. Then, we don't have to die together. We'll die separately. We'll die one by one. Perhaps you're right. Who's going to die first? You! Why don't you speak? | know why! I'I be the first! | don't want to be the first one to die. | don't want to die first. - Do you know why? - Gosuke! | don't want to hear about your reasons. Nishikawa. Let's try the shack again. We might find something else. They found a fisherman's shack the night they got ashore. The fishermen stayed in the shack, and collected sea-urchins in spring and kelp in summer. But in winter the shack was left empty. If there hadn't been a box of matches on the altar, they'd have frozen to death at once. There's something here. Wait, wait. Good. Kelp! Nishikawa. What're you doing? Nothing else? Hachizo? Hachizo, are you there? I'm here, Gosuke. Calm down and sleep. If you sleep, you'll feel better. Hachizo... The reason why I don't want to die is because | don't want my body to be eaten. What? Eat you?! You mean me, eat you? Never! Damn it! We aren't bears or wolves. Stop thinking such revolting things. Will you... promise you won't eat me after I die? | promise. We're from the same village. And we were on the same boat. How could I eat you? Would you eat... someone who wasn't from the same village or boat? Stop that talk. | don't want to hear about such things. Gosuke... I'm... just going to the beach. Wait there. You won't do anything rash, will you? Hachizo! Wait for me. Take me to the beach, too. This is it. The drift ice has come. Until the ice disappears, we're stuck here. If we try to move, we'll die. What shall we do? Do you still refuse? If you refuse, you'll be branded a coward. No. I'm not a coward. But... | won't eat human flesh. To eat human flesh... - Is shameful. - Why? Why is it shameful? Well, if you refuse, that's fine. | don't intend to order you to eat it. I'm only saying this to you because I don't want you to die. Captain. - I don't mind dying. - [ understand you very well. But... If we just let time pass, we'll die for nothing. Nishikawa. Don't you want to die in war as a hero and be decorated for bravery? You haven't forgotten our duty as mariners? | haven't forgotten. Then how could you starve to death... without ever getting on board and working for the nation again? Even a lazy man or a coward can do that. Once you eat human flesh, you won't be a normal man. That's what you're scared of. You're scared of people saying you survived on human flesh. So you're talking about that. We should hurry and put his body into the sea. Hachizo, aren't you shocked to hear such talk? I'd like to be shocked, but [ can't be. | can't understand why I'm not shocked. But I'm not. Then, were you also thinking about eating his body? It's not that I was thinking about it. It's just, the thought came into my mind. It's too bad the thought came into my mind. Once it did come, it wouldn't go away. Let's put his body into the sea. | won't allow that. Shouldn't we perform a service for him? We can perform a service anytime. | wonder if I've heard of a service in which they eat the body. Let us all think hard about it before putting his body into the sea. If we think about it, we can't help going back at it. All' we think about is food, yet the only food we have is Gosuke. Are you... really against eating Gosuke's flesh? | really.. Don't want to eat Gosuke. But | sometimes feel like eating all the flesh over there. Captain, let's put him in the sea. | can't allow that. I'm your Captain. I'm saying this for your sake. We're not cannibals. We are decent Japanese men. Of course... it's natural that we don't want to eat the flesh of our own kind. So why don't we try and see how long we can keep our human feelings? Let's wait and see how long we can stick to it. No. It's not good to wait. All right. Let's wait two days. After two days, we'll put Gosuke in the sea. If we wait for two days, we won't be able to move. Then let's just wait one day. Right? Until tomorrow night. Hey, I remembered something. We should bring the timber from the shack we pulled down. We won't be able to move ourselves pretty soon. Let's go. Nishikawa. Come here. Strip off his clothes. Are we having a feast tonight? Dad's going to Otaru tomorrow. Dad's going to Otaru. We're carrying army supplies to Otaru. The sea will be rough tomorrow. Don't worry, Grandpa. Yasutaka. Stop crying. Your daddy will come back soon. Come here and eat your meal. Hey, give me some light. It's very tough. Here, eat this. | understand. Eating human flesh is a painful thing to do. But you didn't eat it. Well... Before Gosuke died, | promised him I wouldn't. If I hadn't made that promise, | too would have eaten him. Why...? Why did I eat him? You did it out of loyalty to the Emperor. | did it for my own sake. Listen. It wasn't your fault. You had to do it because you were hungry. It's not a crime, if you ate it because you were starving. Hachizo. Do you think the Captain is a bad man? In both a good and a bad sense, he is a resourceful man. Even now, perhaps, he's calculating when [I die. And when I'm dead, you'll both survive on me. He's probably calculating how long I'll last. Is that what he's...? That's not all. He'll be thinking about what will happen after I've been eaten. Nishikawa, will you just stand up? Stand up. Here I am. Stand a little further back. Further back. Well? Move further inside the cave. It's terrifying! What's terrifying? Behind your head | can see a ring of light. |can't see it. | can see it very well. It's an illusion. It's not. There's an old saying, that if one eats human flesh, a ring of light appears behind one's head. And that the light is similar to the glow of luminous moss. It's an illusion. An illusion! It's an illusion. Just an illusion. An illusion... Can you still see it? Can you see it?! Hey, can you see it? No. | can't see it anymore. See? It was an illusion. No, it wasn't. The ring of light is not something that can be seen easily. One can see it only from a certain angle, and for a short time. And only when one tries to see it. | don't like this! | don't like this, I don't like this! | don't want it! Nishikawa. There's no need to worry. Nobody can see it except me. Only [ can see it. And I am going to die very soon. No, please don't die. Don't die. You mustn't die. Hachizo, I beg you. Please don't die, Hachizo. | beg you, please don't die. Captain! Hachizo's dying. If we don't do something, he'll die. He won't eat Gosuke's flesh, so we can't help him. One of us is dying! Don't you feel anything? Even if I did, that wouldn't save his life. You... you're waiting... for Hachizo to die, $0 you can eat his body. He'll die soon, whether | wait for him to die or not. Those who are going to die will die anyway, and those who'll survive have to survive at any cost. - As long as you can eat... - What? As long as you can eat to survive, you don't mind who dies, do you? I'm not a devil. Nobody would want to eat human flesh. If it wasn't for Gosuke dying, you and I might have been dead by now. No one asked him to die. He died of his own accord. He died so you and I ate flesh from his body. Whatever way you look at it, that's all there is to it. | won't hide the fact. If Hachizo dies, | may eat his flesh as well. You'll probably eat it, too. | don't like that. - I don't like that. - Neither do I. Neither of us would like it, but we don't have a choice. | don't like that. | just don't like that! Hey, Nishikawa. Today's New Year's Eve. Hang on until the drift ice breaks up. Nishikawa! Where are you going? The bell... Me, too. I'm going to toll the bell, too. Thus, a month passed. The flesh from Hachizo's body had all gone, and the cold intensified. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. You know, I'm scared of living, and of dying. That's only because you think you're scared. Aren't you scared? | only want to get out of here. | don't think of anything else. We'll never get out of here. Even if we did, we're damned. Nishikawa. You resent me, don't you? You're forced to eat human flesh. And there's more... You're scared that I'll kill you and eat your body afterwards. - That's right. - I see. So you can't sleep, even if you want to, right? Why don't you kill me? You should kill me and eat the flesh from my body. | won't kill you. | don't need to kill you, you'll die anyway. It won't be long now. Nishikawa! Drink this. Captain... Aren't you... scared of yourself? | want... to know how you feel, in yourself? I'm enduring, you see. You may not know why you have to endure, but you endure it. If I don't know why; | can't endure. Same here. I've no idea what I'm enduring, yet I'm still enduring. | know... that you know exactly what you're enduring. That's enough. You keep enduring, and go to sleep. You... you won't eat me! Are you going to kill me? | don't... want you... to eat me! Even if I die, you won't eat me! If you die, I'm going to eat you anyway. Do you... really mean to get out of here? I'd rather the sharks got me, than have you eat me! Why? Why do you say such a terrible thing? You... I thought you were a good man. Nishikawa/ Just wait. It would be such a waste. Here, drink this. But, Nishikawa, do you know why you're suffering so much? Is it because you're cold? Or is it because... you ate the flesh of your own kind? Or is it because we can't escape from here? No. You don't know yourself. You're suffering from all those things at once. You don't really know... why you're suffering. And I'm the same. Remove him from the court. Order! According to the Defence, necessity drove the accused to eat human flesh. | dispute that claim. Under the same circumstances, Gosuke and Hachizo chose death rather than eat human flesh. As for Nishikawa, although he ate with the Captain, he was attempting suicide out of shame when the Captain killed him. Each of the three victims, though to different degrees, expressed human emotion and human suffering. Yet the accused survived without any remorse or suffering. Even after the crime was exposed, he has shown no sense of remorse. His abnormal behaviour and arrogance in court is clear testimony to his criminal character. Only after severe interrogation, did he confess the full extent of his crime. But he hasn't said a word on his own feelings... about this atrocious crime. This is either because he dares not disclose his base thoughts, or because he's cunningly decided to keep silent, in the hope of getting a favourable verdict. The Defence seems worried about the Accused's feelings, but those of the families of Gosuke, Hachizo and Nishikawa are surely more important. Their fathers, their sons, their husbands were eaten. Understanding their feelings is the best basis for judgement. If we can feel the families' grief and anger, we have no need to ask such a low character about his base thoughts. That's right! Order! Your Honour, please let the Accused speak. The Accused has been given many chances to speak, but he hasn't spoken. Please give him another chance. If the Accused candidly speaks his mind, | too would like to hear him. If the Accused wishes to speak, he may do so now. Whatever he may say, his guilt is clear and will not alter the verdict. But the nature of his crime is so bizarre that I'd be interested to know his state of mind. Since the Defence requests it, stand up and speak. Tell us exactly how you feel now. Do you feel sorrow or regret for what you did? Are you feeling any human emotions? Do I have to answer that? Answer. Remember where you are. I am... - Enduring. - Enduring what? I'm enduring many things. "Many things" isn't good enough. Give us an example. Go ahead, feel free. For example, I'm enduring this trial. Do you object to this trial? | don't, sir. In that case, there's nothing to "endure". I'm not objecting to it, sir, I'm just enduring it. Can't you make it clearer? It sounds like you're trying to confuse the court. I'm not complaining about the trial, but a trial seems irrelevant to me. "Irrelevant"? - You've committed a grave crime. - Right. - Are you aware of that? -I am. So you admit your guilt. Then it isn't a matter of endurance. You must be tried. But you see, sir... That's why I'm saying I've no choice but to endure it. | know you think we can't understand you. That's because you're being so arrogant. Can't you be more humble? | can't be more humble than | am now. I'm just enduring a lot of things within myself. You seem to endure a great deal, but that can also mean you're without shame. I'm not trying to argue my way out of things. In the cave, | just endured, as I thought I had to. And now, I feel the same way. I'm enduring. I've never met a villain as glib as you! Is that all you want to say? Excuse me. May I ask a question? What's your question? Ask it. Allow me to ask you, then. Mr. Prosecutor, what kind of food did you eat between December last year and January this year? Order! Is that what you want to know? | ate many different things, but not flesh from a human body. Well then, sir, may I also ask if you've ever had your flesh eaten by someone else? Fortunately, I haven't. My colleagues are not as dangerous as you. | see. They were the only things | wanted to ask. - I understand now. - About what? You may understand something, but I don't. - Answer me. - Do I have to, sir? Just answer me. If... Mr. Prosecutor judges me, | won't feel I've been judged. So you don't want me to judge you? Tell us why not. Who would you accept? Gosuke. Hachizo. Or Nishikawa. All three men you named are now dead. Besides, you killed one of them and ate his whole body. Do you want dead men to judge you? I'm only saying that, if it's you who judges me, | won't feel as if I've been judged. Perhaps you should state your reason. My reason, sir? It's because Mr Prosecutor has never eaten human flesh. - Nor has he... - Very well! What you're saying is that one can't be a Prosecutor unless he's dead, or a criminal like you. No, sir. That's not what I'm saying, sir. Yes, it is. You're trying to blame the nation or society for what you did. Listen. We're trying you now as a society and a nation. You're denying our justice, right? - You want to spit at justice. - I do net, sir. I'm only saying I wish to be judged by someone who has either eaten human flesh, or had his flesh eaten by others. Order! Let him speak. Order! Did you hear him, Your Honour? Those words show his character. The Accused is a hopeless fiend. Does the Accused believe he committed a crime? Is he prepared to accept punishment? | won't... object, if I'm sentenced to death. Then why do you disobey the Prosecutor? | didn't disobey him, sir. | only spoke because the Prosecutor forced me to... That's a lie. You're lying. You want to challenge the court's authority. I've no such intention, sir. - I'm only enduring. - You see? You want to say that none of us here can judge your crime. You want to evade punishment because we're all human. But you can't do that. Now, I'll remind you of the crime you committed. Did you start eating Gosuke and Hachizo from their fingers, or from their ears? Did you start skinning Nishikawa from the front or from the back? How did ripping the nails off sound? What was the texture of the flesh? Mr. Prosecutor! Isn't it indecent to imagine such details of something you've never done? Have you no shame? I'm just enduring. What you did disgraced the Japanese people! You damaged our national honour! How could you apologise to His Imperial Majesty for what you did? | don't think... that His Majesty and | are so different. What are you saying? | think His Majesty is also enduring. | forbid the Accused to speak. Clear the court! Court adjourned. Court ajdourned! Court adjourned. Everybody out! Everybody out! Everybody out! Take shelter, everyone! Air-raid alert! To the shelter! | can't possibly continue to defend you. That's fine, sir. | knew it from the start. There's really no one... who can do anything for me. You seem resigned to your fate. No, I'm not, sir. Actually, it's quite the opposite. I've just remembered something. There was one thing | wanted you to do, but perhaps it would be difficult for you. So, what is it? It is... that you eat me. But I don't think you can do that, sir. You can't possibly do that. No one would want to do such a thing. | wish... at least that gentleman could eat me. Why do you point your finger at me? Do you mean I'm different? No, sir. I was just... Are you saying I ate human flesh? No, sir! You wouldn't eat human flesh. You're the Prosecutor, aren't you? You're a respectable person. All the people here are respectable people. There's a clear difference between us. | mean, see the ring of light around my head? Look closely. You can see it, if you try. That's the stigma I bear. Are you still talking nonsense? What's this about a "ring of light"? | can't see anything. Can the Defence counsel see anything? | can't. A ring of light surrounds me. That's the sign of my guilt. If such a sign exists, atrial isn't needed. That's right, sir. So you must look hard. Your Honour, can you see anything? How could I see anything? You must be able to. Are you saying you can see it yourself? | can't see it myself, but you should be able to. Please look. Why are you the only one who can't see it? The one with the ring can't see it. Those who ate human flesh can't see it But I can't see anything. Neither can I. Can't you see it either, sir? | can't believe that. Neither the Prosecutor nor the Judge can. That's impossible. If that is the case, it's terrifying. That's not possible. Please, come closer. You must come closer and look at me. Please look. Please look at me more closely! Please look at me. Look hard. I'm sure you will see it! You must take this seriously. It's important. It's important. Look closely at me! Your Honour! Please look at me, sir. Look closely at me. Can you see anything, Your Honour? Please look. Can't you see it? Look hard, please. Look hard, please. Please! Look hard at me! Look at me, please! Headmaster! Well, then. Thank you. Thank you very much for everything. | didn't do much. Well, | suppose I can't die yet. Please go ahead.
