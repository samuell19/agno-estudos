We'd especially like to speak with you at the top of our big super show, Pop Idols. Coming up, the Pop Idols, Simon, Charly, and Gigi, will answer your questions. You know, when I'm singing, I can't see the audience I see the spotlights, sometimes a face... a look, whether it's mean or nice... I don't really know. Yes, you don't know... okay. Your role isn't to know. But you must feel something. It's an empty void for you, the audience. And nothing else? No... because I'm blinded by the spotlights. I can't see the audience. But you love the audience? ...Sure... I love them, 'cause they love me. Well you know they love you a lot. So do you love them a lot? Of course. Since I live for them. Consumers. Voyeurs. They're only reflecting what's out there. That's what they do. Yeah. There's a bad and a good audience. - They're bad because...? - Like a dog eating his vomit back up. Being an Idol is... it's being identified with God. You're young but some people already consider you the top producer and manager. To what should we attribute your so rapid success? To luck. To our generation which craves everything new and dynamic. A burning desire for... for rejuvenation... The "what-you-call-it" of youth. That's Idol: Living the ultimate Pop hit: Yeah-Yeah-Yeah!

Ladies and gentlemen of the press, select fans of Gigi, Charly and Simon, our close associate and friend, Mr. Camel, has arranged, as a sneak preview... in lieu of the usual but a bit off-putting press conference... this little get together. - This little party. - This little party, then. Ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the press, fans of Gigi, Charly and Simon, you may... - Raise your glasses... - speak freely with your beloved Idols. Ladies and gentlemen, and all of our dear young friends, It's under the banner of the whole truth, that we place our latest musical spectacle... and so with complete frankness, our Idols will answer all of your questions. Is there anyone who would like to get us started? - How did Charly get started? - What a great question! Charly. Over to you. Me, Charly, I'm not much of a speaker. The butter of education was never spread on my toast. I'm the son of a worker... Whose daddy was at the factory, All the live long day, Manufacturing aspirin. But I... of that bread, I wouldn't eat at all. Not so much as one crumb. None of that bread for me, daddy. That's what I kept telling myself, At that tender age, when I was twelve. But, yes, yes, now you'll see, Just where that wound up taking me. Yeah! Come in. Jean Camel, Youth Advocate, Press Agent, and Mr. Tourleffete, Artistic Director for Idol Productions. - Are you commies? - Oh, no, Commissioner! - Some nerve! Alleging that about me. - Sorry. - He wasn't asking... - I'd like to speak. My windshield has been broken. - Ah! Oh, oh... an accident! - Yes, in our opinion, it must have been a pebble. - Shut your trap! - Shut my trap? About what? - The windshield! - Ah! Did someone get jack your car? - Yes, to my shame! - To his shame! I was driving in my red Jaguar, the badge of my success, - Have a seat. - No, thanks. I was rolling along when out of nowhere a pebble was thrown! Into the windshield. - I could have defended myself. - I hope so... But, then someone stuck me up with his switchblade and I was overwhelmed. - I can identify him. - Imagine what might have happened. It was an exclusive neighborhood where this happened to me. Stay cool! Let's go! Shut it! Hot stuff! Seems you're so hot, you're turning pink! You're burning up! If I had my switchblade, I'd give you some vent holes. Back off! Take your hands off me. My leather jacket! Don't act like you're blind. Why'd you go and do that? If only I had my switchblade! Call them off! Where's the justice in this? In the punchlines. But what crime has he committed? - A car! He'd stolen it! - So he stole it? - With which he took a joyride! - So he took a joyride? - But what should befall him? - What should he fall into? Just a Jaguar that he traded in for what he'd found dumped in some remote place. We'll leave it to him to say the word here A red Jaguar with souped-up custom engine? He'd get that Jaguar once he made his switch, With the 2CV that he'd stolen. So for my Jaguar, he's come back with a 2CV? It's from Micheline! That's my wife, Commissioner. - Where could he have dumped it? - He couldn't have left it in Paris. They're found there all the time. A 2CVs, The top open, Under a sky, blue, And I'm rolling. Inside, happy. Underneath the stars, But we're dying, Quietly, So, anchors away! Go ahead and sing! You'll do it sooner or later. - Take this gentleman away! - But no, Commissioner! No! - Are you in charge? I'm in charge here! - But no, Commissioner! Just now, he was only singing that hit song that everybody's singing. My card. Did you see that? I'm trying to say, the young man here, trusts me. "But he trusts me, Commissioner!" "Idols Productions will make a role model out of him" "for the mommies fearful that their kids have fallen in love with Pop singers." What are you saying, Charly? What are you saying? Well... with that song, they re-educated me, I'd earn a lot of money, and then I'd have no reason to become a...a delinquent. Stop right there! This young man here is on the wrong side of the law! As it happens, the law, that's me. He's stolen a 2CV. No, Mr. Commissioner, he didn't steal it. Sure, Charly. You simply borrowed it. Yeah. Yes, that's right, friends, I was borrowing it, I swear. I'm willing to turn a blind eye, but I'll hold you responsible for him. I promise you, Commissioner, he won't start up again. Come along, young man. Pretty soon, you'll be driving off in a Jaguar. A Jaguar? A Jaguar... The top up, And me inside, My switchblade out. I'm slashing the tires On every Citro?n 2CVs that passes. I'm gonna climb, Climb so high! And you, Gigi, where were you back then? Me... Dear listeners, Mister Camel, press agent number one and number one in so much else, will introduce himself Gigi la Folle's show. - Over to you, friend. - Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen, moments from now, Gigi la Folle will make her entrance... and here already, before that, comes a banner where one may see the divine in all her divinity, and here... What's this? A maypole decked out with risqu? ribbons like those she dares to wear and that she passes out, strip by strip to her screaming fans! And here's a cart which she seems to have loaded up with her little shoes! She must have some magic in store for us...and I... I... Look! Over there! Here! She's here! Who? She's about to take the stage! Gigi... Gigi... The one you're all crazy about! Your Idol... Gigi la Folle! Right now, Gigi is going to perform, it's my pleasure to announce: "The Seahorse"! The seahorse thought he'd be real cute. If he put on some go-go boots! But a seahorse doesn't have any hooves So they just won't fit him, these old shoes. "No Daddy"! "No Daddy"! "No Daddy"! So... by popular demand, here is my big hit which you all know: "No, Daddy". My father told me... My mother, too, "No, you cannot marry that young man." But I love him! I come to life when I see him. How he smiled, At what I told him. My father told me... My mother, too, "You must marry this gentleman." "He's nice and respectable." But no, daddy! I won't marry him! That old bastard, He ain't no good. But no, daddy! I won't marry him! That old bastard. He can't make love. And now, I'd like to thank my dear lyricists. Thanks to you, good songwriters, who write for us idiots our words. Sure. It's true... that only due to the idiotic noises our voices make that they prosper. But that's only money! That won't buy happiness! But it sure makes an Idol! Now friends, I'd very much like to tell you about my childhood, ...about my family, about my grandpa. about my grandma, about mommy, and about my daddy! One, two... One, two, three, four... Je n'ai jamais aim? m?m? She never ever grabbed me, granny! Daddy is in the dumps! With grumpy, grumpy, granny. Ever since poppy got stuck in his trunk, His one eye naked in the wind, She never ever grabbed me, granny! And pops never popped for daddy. But, but... Granny! He pops me...? My how pops' one eye seeped! It made daddy so worried... He had granny's nose for a bulging, seeping eye. She never ever grabbed me, granny! Poppy never popped for daddy. But, but... Granny! He pops for me...? Who got stuck in his trunk With one eye gaping in the wind? And while daddy wept, Granny, who had no heart, Taught mommy a lesson. By constantly insinuating That daddy was a rat! The dirtiest and filthiest rat! She even persuaded me to stick myself in the trunk. I crammed myself in with gramps! And then granny took some photographs. And when they were ready, she cried out: Oh! Daddy, daddy, daddy? Pops! I saw his bulging eye seeping! And daddy began to howl with rage! And when he came to, After about an hour, He gave me such a pounding And mommy laughed and laughed and laughed. And daddy yelled and yelled and yelled. Oh poppy, if only you could've seen it, If only you could've seen it... How satisfying would that have been... To see your son make boom-boom On the fanny of your little girl? My little Heloise... No! It's not Heloise. It's Gigi plain and simple. Gigi, listen to what we're saying to you, please. Your latest song is quite simply obscene. - "Obscene", please... - I know what I'm saying! Obscene, absurd, and awkward! Family, Gigi. Family. That's the Idol's market. And you've ridiculed them. The granny is presented as an old sadist! - Manouche! - I know what I'm saying! The grandpa's a stiff and the dad's a zero! And the mommy, while demure, nonetheless, laughs while the daddy's spanking the little girl. The song's not very moral. It's true, Gigi. It was completely ridiculous... and insulting. You don't insult the audience that feeds you! - You give a little thought for your belly at least! - Manouche! We need to talk about Charly. He has a conference tomorrow. Right now, this is about Gigi. Never mind Charly, please. Oh, I don't mind. You can talk about Charly if you want. Watch it, Gigi. - Watch it! - The number of letters I received after my last special surpassed those of the preceding month. - Is that true? - That's right. I checked. Yes, even more. I'm always the last to be told... Well, we need to talk about Charly and tomorrow's conference! Oh, you and your 'tomorrow's conference' all the time! Come. We should take our seats. You all know our dear collaborator and friend, Mister Camel, our press agent, to whom falls the honor of presenting our new star. Charly le Surineur... who, there's little doubt, will shortly be an Idol. I'd like to begin, if I may, by providing you with a definition of the Idol. The Idol is the embodiment in a single individual of aspirations for the success others have that we have no chance of achieving, ever! It's the jackpot, the clear victory, the living proof that anybody can be somebody Well... just as some professor might put it: "If anybody can be somebody, as soon as he's somebody, he's no longer anybody!" Once the Idol has acquired fame, he must behave and talk like anybody would imagine he would behave if he had been a success. The Idol always does exactly what the public expects him to do. But enough theory, let's move on to practice. "How to attract public sympathy?" Here we have a film segment showing Charly mingling with his youth audience, unassuming... authentic, asking him to talk about his childhood. If you would... Hello, my... my friends. My life... it's no better than yours is. It's just that... I've had some luck. Luck, in our business it counts for a lot. I'm a workers' son. My mother was a seamstress and my father was ill. And me... in the streets! The school of hard knocks. That's where I learned to play some guitar and the switchblade! The knife. That's how I got my last name, Charly le Surineur. I never offed a punk, By which I mean to say... I never killed anyone. But anyway, I'd have turned out bad, if Idols Productions hadn't taken charge... of my education. Perfect! In this TV spot for a general audience, Charly employs only everyday words and a pinch of slang which he never fails to translate. His position as a star, ensures him entr?e to cosmo society functions, ...and by cosmo, I mean aristocratic. So, using a vocabulary that is dignified and distinguished recommends itself. Second lesson: "Vocabulary". If you would. It's better to say "a vehicle" than "a car", "affliction" than "pain", "instantaneously" than "suddenly", "circumspect" than "careful", "draw" than "pull", "indentured" than "bilateral", "crimson" than "red". That went well. That went really, really well. Now, you are a gentleman. Yeah, yeah! I know. Now, I am a gentleman! Wisdom flows from my mouth. I know one doesn't doff a chick. One undresses a respectable lady because that makes it pleasant for her. And the older and richer she is, the more beautiful she is! And don't forget, take her jewels as quietly as you can. One doesn't say gigolo, but playboy. not "hustler", but "youth idol"! Those are bitter words, Charly. Bitterness doesn't become a hit. A hit, Charly! Huh? A hit. Yeah, yeah. I know, I know... "Try to be agreeable! Make yourself agreeable! "The more agreeable you are, the more money you'll earn, and the more money you earn, the more loved you'll be." Being loved, that's agreeable. That earns a lot of money, doesn't it? For a fag, sure! Make him shut up! Charly! Think of the money we've spent on you and also why you're here. Why? To reminisce about the important milestones in your life, which have made an Idol out of you and your songs. Instead of that, Charly, you present us with the spectacle of an embittered young man: disillusioned with a life that hasn't been complete. Well you've succeeded in that, Charly. That's right! "Success"! Think of those who have failed. Of those who have fallen from the top, Charly. The top! Simon, you, whom the trials of life have so severely judged, tell Charly what it means to be a failure. - Simon! Simon, the readers of "Paris Dimanche" want to know why it hasn't worked out for you. Between us, Simon, the public has given up on you. I read here that you've only sold 350 copies of your latest record, down from 1,200,000 for the last one. I don't get it. Am I obsolete? Obsolete? Not at all. Not at all. I used to be the uncontested champion of the international hit-parade. "Simon le Magicien" fan clubs were springing up in every town. Hundreds of thousands of letters poured in each day to my post office box. There's nothing I haven't done to succeed. Believe me, I spared no pains. I had just been studying applied photogenics when I applied. And I'd become the leader in the field of the disciple of Living Expression. In my poses, I could embody all the expressions that the public expects from an Idol at the height of fame. I don't get it. I don't get it! I don't get it! I was the uncontested champion of the international hit-parade! "Simon le Magicien" fan clubs started up in every town! Hundreds of thousands... thousands of letters poured each day into my P.O. box. There's nothing I wouldn't have done to succeed! I'd just been studying applied photogenics when I applied and I'd become the leader in the field of the discipline of Living Expression! In my poses, I could embody all of the expressions that the public expects from an Idol at the height of fame! The modest guy. Mr. Big Stuff, full of himself. The appreciative guy. The disgusted guy. The mystic guy, but an extrovert. The enthusiastic guy, but who's farsighted The sporty guy, but thoughtful. The guy who drinks red wine... The one who drinks tea... Le gars ? qui on la fait pas... The good guy, Content... Loyal... Clean. Healthy. Educated. Worried. The arty guy, but he's polite. Sentimental... Chaste. Pleasant... Joker... Distinguished... Charitable... Thrifty... Candid... Happy... Blissful... I succeeded even in refining the most varied expressions, the most... contradictory. For example, the guy who's at once arty, sporty, educated... appreciative, mystic, chaste, proper, legit... All of the publicity photos captured, Simon, your... inexhaustible inventory of varied poses. Yes. I had photos in all the papers. So what. Nobody reads the papers. There. That's why I'm not better known. That's true, Simon. Television has taken our readers away. So. It's because I'm not telegenic. Oh, no, Simon. You fill the small screen magnificently. And my horoscopes? They were wild about my horoscopes. They wrote from all over the world for them. I had it all. Plain and simple, I could have had it all. Plip, plop. Where'd that come from? The whole audience is knackered. Well here it is: the clog in the drain. Plip, plop, fizz, plip, Plip, plop, plip... It's a truism: the public is fickle, ungrateful. But tell me, which was your greatest hit of all? My greatest hit of all... must have been "Come into My Heart". 800000 discs sold in three weeks. Come along into my heart, And pick a flower there, You'll find the scent Of my past inside. Four days to wait. Sleepless nights, all the way. You were my roof... my shelter. My life, my magic life. But when it came, the beautiful day, To say, "Yes," to the Priest, My daddy and my mommy would be there. To open up their arms... out to here Those were eight verses that millions of people sang along to. I was the King... God. The Idol. The Number One. - You need more ice? - Yes, if you would. I even published my memoirs in your paper, you may recall. Yes. I remember them very well. If I'm not mistaken, Simon, before you were an Idol, you were a clairvoyant psychic. Yes. I could read the future in cards and coffee grounds. But my specialty was the rotten egg. I'd crack a rotten egg, and read the future in the odor it released. One day, Gigi la Folle, she was called Heloise back then and had only had a small d?but which got released on 45 without much success, She came and found me. I'm at your service, miss. - My name's Heloise. - Ah. Sir... Miss? I've been waiting for such a long time at the bottom of the stairs leading to the tower of success. I want to see. So... when you peer into the coffee grounds or into your crystal ball, shall my destiny ultimately attain the lofty heights of my ambitions? It's hell, being on earth. while the pop stars sparkle in the sky... My specialty is the rotten egg, cracked to release its odor which my extrasensory nose deciphers, communicating to my brain which, falling into a trance, reveals at last a clear vision of the future. Here's an egg which was born when I was. If I crack this egg., I'll see your whole life inside, and you'll no longer have a future. You'll be without a destiny! You'll simply no longer live. You will have accomplished all that I will have revealed. I must know! Your life belongs to you. Okay. I'm cracking it... The egg! - It's sheer madness! - I am "Folle"! But... But what, I ask you, is my life worth? In exchange for a little success? No. I'm asking you for nothing. Yeah... yeah... I can feel it! Come on! Yeah. I'll take success and leave my life to you! By leaving your life to me, you've condemned me to die the day of your death! Only the dead can lead the dead into the realm of the dead. I don't want... I don't want to drag you down...! You've been playing with fire, which knows just one law: To burn! I've been waiting... for such a long time! At the bottom of the steps, which mount the tower of success! She was "folle" as a hatter, little Heloise. She succumbed to ideas, funny ideas, about life and death... and about me. I suggested her name to her. Gigi la Folle is a pretty name. And since it could contribute to my renown, I'll take it. And you're to thank. And I thank you. Sorry, I don't have any money. I don't have any money. In the meantime, I could pay you with a service, which I will render you. Listen... - I sing myself, too. A little bit... - Well. That's great. And... if you could, since you're maneuvering through it, if you could... Oh! Consider it done! We're listening. Rolling! We became such good friends... That we were holding hands. And truly joyous, Towards tomorrow we rushed, We never bothered along the way, With what other people would say, And young girl, We're such good friends, Oh yeah? A bit, fine, "What's yours is mine." Let's treat each other this way, Treating night like it was day. And enjoying it all the way, Like tomorrow is today, We're such good friends, We shall always be... The world's full of tomorrows, We are so young, Full of enthusiasm, We love our parents, With all of our hearts. This thing needs to go out to all the stations. Monsieur, we're signing you. You'll go far with this song. There... there are more verses... Don't you want to hear them? - Such good frien... - You've been signed! - Hold on. Come on. Okay, you'll see... - We're such good friends... - But you've been signed! I've been signed? Ah! It became a big hit. Yes. 1,200,000 records sold A fortune, in one month. Spent as quickly... - You owe a lot to Gigi la Folle, Simon. - An enormous amount. But doesn't she? You gave her the name that made her a hit. I recognized that. The proof: he's the one I chose to be witness at my marriage. Ah... the marriage of Gigi... and Charly... They're young to have made it so fast. Angelo's father is very rich. Idols' Productions is a very large concern. Real fortunes aren't made so quickly. - We'll see... - I'm tired. Tired of... Ah... the cocktails! Every Friday, it's horrible. I give up. - But where is the young couple? I haven't seen Angelo Laffitte today? What's going on? Oh, no, no. Angelo has gone. He's in the middle of planning a summer tour for Gigi and Charly. - Already? - They owe it to their audience. The poor kids. Let them relax a little. But... how about some photographs... uh... - over by the pool... I don't know... - Photographs? a little undressed or something... - Oh, no. No, I don't think so. - Oh? Oh... I think not. We could organize something if you want in the coming days, but - today is the wedding and... - Yeah, right. Right, yeah. It's a little hard, I understand, a little hard, you think. Oh look! Look! That's Abbot Vincent arriving. And I bless, with great pleasure, these children who are successful children and who hold dear the rites and morals of Christian simplicity. The angels... Don't they express themselves in song? And even if the rhythm today is more... how should I put it, more... Y?-y? than God has endowed them with: he's made other arrangements. Myself, I've never hesitated to blast my parish with a little wind... I can carry quite a tune. All for the glory of God and His works. May it be so. And... Here we are today with two of the most prestigious children of popular songs, to unite them before God for life. I'd be remiss not to remind you, in what esteem the church holds the popular songs, as long as it knows how to stay within the bounds of decency, of healthy pleasure, and respectable distraction. Oh! Sister Hilarity is here! Well, what a surprise! Dear sister, what a pleasure! My Lord Abbot, you do me an honor. Dear sister, I'm pleased to see you. - The Abbot himself said so. - It's an honor to have you with us today. How many copies have you sold of your last record? - 2,300,000 copies, Father. - Oh. That's just beautiful. That's just fine. That's just beautiful, just fine, isn't it? - Noteworthy! - Noteworthy! Would you do us the honor of singing your latest hit? Oh, Madame... I don't know if I should. But yes! But yes, but yes. But yes. Well, in that case, Lord Abbot... O God, look after Your children, May they be content To sing Your praises. Strike up the angels' hymn: Glory to God, in Highest Heaven! Hallelujah! God, amongst us, everywhere. O God, in Your armies, We go out to fight impieties, And make rule over all France Faith, Charity, Hope Glory to God, in Highest Heaven! Hallelujah! God, amongst us, everywhere. O God, bless these children Who shall owe to You both their joys and their torments Bless the sons who will be born From their legitimate union! Glory to God, in Highest Heaven! Hallelujah! God, amongst us, everywhere. Glory to God, in Highest Heaven! Hallelujah! God, amongst us, everywhere. Glory to God, in Highest Heaven! Hallelujah! God, amongst us, everywhere. Everything there's going very well. Perfect! But we have learned the winners of the big radio contest... - "The Best Families in France". - ...who have won the right to present their questions to Gigi, Charly and Simon. And without much risk of being mistaken, I can confirm that they're here to interview their dear Idols. Without further delay, Fans of Pop Idol, over to you! Gigi, what do you think of your marriage? Well, my friends, let me Tell you about that: marriage. It's a beautiful book, Full of blank pages, To write upon for the length of his days. Charly said so. Yes. He can tell you about it, too. I'd like that. Yes. I've sworn To do that for as long as I'm living. My charming and my so sweet Gigi. This marriage fulfills our vows, We're going to live happily. Charly, did you wear a black jacket? I may be rich now, but... I don't forget about my past. Gigi? How old are you? My life begins today with Charly! Simon? Do the three of you get along well together? We're friends, yeah. Gigi? Do you want children? Yes! a boy and after that a girl and after that a boy again and after that a girl again. Charly! Do you prefer Coca-Cola? Coca-Cola? Sure, it's good.. Charly, as an athlete, what do you think of racing cyclists? They're pedaling. Gigi, are you happy? Oh yes! Because Charly?s gonna to get me an Alfa Romeo, a diamond necklace, and a bouquet of violets. - Charly? When will you do your military service? - Never! Oh, but you've misunderstood, Charly! You were only asked "when" you'll do your military service. Never. Wha...? Angelo? John? What is this? Charly has always said yes... That he'd been thrown out... that he'd burned... to do...his military service. No. That's not true. - Do something, quick! - I'll save face. I'll save face. Charly, my son, come to your senses. Your military service, you must do it... - No! - when the time comes! For the moment, you're concerned about your marriage. to Gigi, whom you love and who loves you. With Gigi whom I love and who loves me. The truth, friends? The truth! The truth! - The truth, Gigi? - The truth, Charly. The truth is that our managers arranged for us to get married. - That's not true. - Not true? "Gigi and Charly, you've got to get married, and fast!" For publicity, have you forgotten? "Your marriage will save our business." "A beautiful wedding, Gigi. All of Paris will come to admire you." "There'll be radio, papers, television there!" We obeyed and we got married. But that evening, once we were alone in our honeymoon suite... Tell me, Charly... you and me, in the same bed? In bed together? As lovers? Well that's one game that I don't want to play. I don't want to, I don't want to! Uh huh, what you want... Here's what you want. What I want..., I want... fuck you, if that's what you want me to do. You're scared stiff you won't be able to handle me. That dress that you're wrapped up in, gives me the right to throw you on the bed and take you, if you keep pushing! - If you want? - And I can! - You're a dog! - I'll knock you out if you resist! - Bite your lips! - The lowest of the low! And splatter your blood all over your white dress! - Charly! I don't love you! - Me neither! I hate you! - Strip! - Never. But... but you're the wife, Gigi, Assume your position on this bed. You've only got to undress. This is our wedding night and we'll get through it, with hatred or love. I'll rip it off you. We fucked. Show the whole family, all our friends, the dirty sheets, - the ripped dress and our puffy eyes. - But we have no family or friends! - What? - But we do! Friends! More friends! in the papers, the magazines, and the cinemas, all expecting and eager to read in our smiles, happiness, our good luck! - Good luck! - Happiness! - Happiness! - Good luck! - Good luck! - Happiness! Good luck! Adieu, happiness. Close your eyes. Close your eyes, my Gigi. And now think about your boyfriend, while you give yourself to your husband! Charly! Charly! You boor! I don't want to see you! I'd rather die! Rather than suffer upon myself the burden of your base needs! Ah... That's right. I forgot. You're... you're refined, huh? You like... you like foreplay. I've shocked your fine delicateness. Well forgive me. Forgive me, Gigi. But I have I have some delicate manners, too. So know this! That it's not the burden of my base needs that will fall onto you, but your charm working on me, stirring up in me insane desires, against nature to possess the woman I've married. - But you're not in love! - And who doesn't love me. Charly... Charly... Charly... This is intolerably provocative! - You need to sit down! - We are hereby married, indeed! Behold! The veritable marriage ceremony of Gigi and Charly. I see it cracking, falling from heaven upon me... who am no longer myself! I want you to worship each other. and to be Gods. We consecrate... In this, there's the sound Of Reason Since Reason is necessary. It will set you straight. This is your fault! This was your idea. It was my idea and you approved it, didn't you? We've got to do something. Make an announcement. Something... Pull yourself together! Excuse me? Paris Express? - Do you think there'll be a scandal? - Explain yourselves! - Simon, it's suicide! - Explain yourself! You owe us! Over here! Charly, I'd like to see you. - How much do you earn? - Have you become a militant? - What are your demands? - Are you communists? Red Army? Will you agree to answer our questions? We have no comment. I know nothing. - You won't agree to answer questions - Yes. Yes. I think Charly owes us an explanation for all this. And why haven't you done your military service? My military service? This is charming. Delightful. It's really very nice. Indeed. Very relaxing. We would have prepared a hearty home cooked meal but given the time, it would have been rushed. Oh, Madame, it's really unnecessary to follow military protocol today. Everyone's heads have been stuffed with such extravagant ideas, such stupidities. Mr. Chief of Staff mind you that we've always tried to do our very best. Yes, I... I know that. Mr. Chief of Staff of the Defense Ministry, on the topic of our Charly... Oh, no. Surely you understand, the Ministry deems this immoral: that this young man should dodge his compulsory military service, a duty he owes to his country. To be lenient in a case like this one would have a disastrous effect on the morale of our tender youth. But Mr. Chief of Staff, we're only suggesting a leave of absence: A simple leave of absence for one year. Yes. We've spent so much money. Money, so much money. My husband's trying to say that the investments that were made to launch Charly?s career have required us to make considerable sacrifices. Suspending his career right now would mean financial disaster that would be extremely difficult for us to recover from. You must understand that our annual contributions to the fund for the upkeep of the Disabled Officers' Administration could be severely compromised. Yes. There's a beautiful pool here. You're right. A nice yard... Well. Let's say that Charly were to leave for one year, maybe for two years, on tour, abroad, In that case, well in that case, it would be in the country's interest, even from a cultural point of view. The Defense Ministry appreciates that this would involve a higher interest. And given such an eventuality, the reform envisaged, well, I would no longer see any utility in those sanctions... I agree. But... Well, a tour, that would cost a lot. It's either profitable or it's not. Oh, yes. But, Madame, you'd surely receive a grant. I can only envision making such an arrangement under those terms. Under the circumstances... For Mr. Chief of Staff, a sip of champagne. Oh. Thank you but I... actually I'm a bit allergic. I'd prefer some beer. - I object! This is a gross distortion! - It's the precise truth! We're going to contact our attorneys! - About what? - We will not be defamed! Simon, talk to us about your hits, when you had a number one. The number one. Do you have any stories? Memories? Was there just one girl in your life? Girls? One girl. Yeah... a girl... You'll embrace me. You'll embrace me. Because I am the king. Because I am the king. The Idols! The Idols! I've sung that old song so much, I'm getting sick of it. You just sing it and thousands of girls cry for joy. They do that for you, Simon! You're the Magus! Our Mandrake! The knight who conquers our hearts! Our all! You own our all. And me... the president of the Simon le Magicien fan club. Starting today, I'm devoting myself to you. For life! Life? Simon? Know what? I do, too! I sing! Listen. By midweek, it seems full of life! But me, I'm full of midweek melancholy! Before you were married, when did you get engaged? A long time ago. Tell us how you got engaged. Why did you get engaged? It was a time when everything was going smoothly for Gigi... and for me. This month, your sales were at least 38704 records down from Charly?s last 33 LP. and 38700 records at least from Gigi's last 45 single. Sales of Gigi and Charly records have plummeted. We can't possibly support you with this kind of track record. The declining sales in new records by Pop Stars require us to reconsider our investment Whatever sacrifices we may have to make are ours to decide and not yours. You'll know by tomorrow our decision. Gigi? Where are you? A come back will probably take a little while for you. But things will pick up for you. And pick up good! Beautiful... Charlie... Come here, I've told you, come and sit down here. Come one. Gigi, come over here, closer to me. Come on. Over here. You see... It would be very painful for me to be separated from you. I appreciate you. I sympathize out of friendship for you. You're so young. You're a child. Micheline, is like a mother, and me, I've already got a mother. I've had enough of being a child. I'm no longer a child. You have a scent... your skin, sweet, like a child's. And the look, desire, and strength of a man. - Only my craft interests me. - Exactly, Charly! Exactly! I'm a man. Right, Gigi. Right? Gigi? I'm a man! Gigi, I'm a man, right? Charly! It's all up to you. Maybe you are that darling child who needs to be looked after, who needs to be pushed to heights, higher... and higher than mere hits! A triumph! The biggest international tours, Charly! Both Americas, China, Japan! Montevideo... But you're dreaming. You must not realize that the mere scent of a flower makes me nauseous. Well... you know me now. all of this... Ciao. Ciao, Mr. Laffitte. Ciao. Gigi! I'm begging you! Oh, Madame! Me, Madame? The fairies, at my birth, gave me a certain egg which contains my future. I'm going to go ahead and crack it! And take the stench to Simon, my friend, who will read my fortune. I'd better hit it... Ciao, Madame. Charlie! Ciao. Yes? Hello? Micheline. I've had an idea. I know. I've had the same one. You've waited long enough. So now without further delay... The two number ones on the chart... Both number one on the Pop charts... Two as one! The super-talents of Pop Music are going to sing their number one number! Here's the number one dance of the USA It's danced and it's danced, It's danced like this. Ladies had better take off your shoes. Gentlemen, I'm begging you, take off your shoes. On one foot, you jump like so... And then on the other and both at once. Mister, you'd better slip it in. Mrs. had better jump on her man. Mr. Ducheval, that's one woman! Mrs. Bouclier, on the attack! Mrs., could you get down on your knees. Mister, would you also do the same? Mrs., you want to dance the tango, but Mr. wants to show off. Now that you're starting to dance, These are only the first steps, Of the number one dance of the USA! Mister, go ahead and take the broom! As long as the Mrs. will hand it over. Missus, you chased mister into bed with your friend. Where you found him! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Y?-y?... Gents in the house, stand up! Go ahead and shake it! Ladies, take him in your hands! Help the gentlemen feel good. Better than good. Oh, yeah! Yeah! Mrs., would you please go on with it? On Mister's whacker drop a smacker, Mister, you're awfully ticklish. Crying out for God, "Oh my God!" What you came to see today, Was the number one dance of the USA For sale in France, in Paris, - High end boutique of the United States. - Oh yeah! This has been an ORTF French radio broadcast. The latest song from the Pop Fianc?s has become the most colossal hit recorded to date. However, this spectacular success cannot have come without producing a disastrous decline for the singles of certain pop stars. Simon, you're good for nothing. It's over. Your fan club members aren't going to their meetings any more. Your photo has disappeared from above their beds. They're dreaming about Charly. "Charly and Gigi? Will they get married? "What a crazy couple! Super cool!" That's what they're saying. "The extremely sensitive Gigi "may be about to learn some of life's hard lessons. "Charly, they say, likes to have play around." It's true. It's true! It's true! Me... If Charly asked me to marry him, even if I happened to be engaged to another, I'd tell the other one, "Forget about me!" "My calling is elsewhere!" "Forget about me!" You want me to forget about you, is that right? You're dreaming about Charly, but... Poor darling, you're forgetting about Gigi. Then it's true? Gigi and Charly love each other? Do they love each other? Idols idolize themselves. That's just beautiful... Just beautiful. That's a wonderful story. It's a fairy tale! I know what I'm going to do! Where are you going? I'm going to found a fan club for the Pop Newlyweds! "And the wheel that lifts one up crushes the other one, "and goes along its way, "and we, who are left behind, hung out to dry or crushed, "we go on about our way in unspeakable anguish." Marguerite, Genevi?ve... Poor Nyasse. I'm alone... To my despair. Alone. Alone. Alone. I have no more friends, I am alone. They say that I'm finished. Finished! Okay then, I'd better get finished. Without any hope, So dark is my life. Is there someone here who understands me? No one! No one Is there someone here who understands me? Without any hope, So dark is my life. She left me that same morning. She left me, The only one I loved. Now I'm loved by no one. Here I stand, abandoned. They sure are pretty, your words! He making something up on the spot, improvising. I tried so hard, My eyes were filled with tears. I was crying so much that I lost my love and I found myself empty So I'm going, going... Too literary for the masses. I'm getting cold, very cold Who among you, who would, in your arms, wrap me up? and offer some consoling words to me? I'd have put it in verse. That's more moving. Ridiculous. This can't be spontaneous! But it works! Not at all. The hall's gone cold as ice! Friends... Life! Life! Life! - Arms in the air! - Come back to life! Come along now, friends, Be cool... and clap your hands! Play along now, friends, Be cool and clap your hands! Nothing can be done. He's finished. Come along now, friends, Be cool and clap your hands! Come along now, friends, Be cool and clap your hands! - All right, then. Enough is enough! - The situation can be handled! Falling from so high. That it wasn't enough for me to break my back, to be crushed As shall be crushed, all the men who've fallen Who have fallen or shall fall Charly, since you're not in love, Gigi and you, why can't you just stay friends? You're only engaged, so why are you getting married? Why bother to get married? Why? Well... Gigi and Charly have been engaged for several months and our readers and myself besides are asking when they're going to get married. But Mr. Pecuchet, the "Pop Fianc?s" is little more than a publicity label. A publicity label? Yes and no. Yes? A headline in which... No, no. No, no, no. I am L?on Pecuchet. The Parisian column is not a trash bag. No, not a line. We simply came up together with a catchword... A brand. Yes. Yes, we'll see. We came up with a scheme: to transform into a single couple these two pop stars, who separately, were beginning to decline. And... so you hooked them up. Hooked them up! Hooked them up to an audience, to Pop Music! Off the record, it can be disclosed that, let's just say, they don't get along very well. When I inform my readers that Gigi and Charly only got engaged for publicity purposes and they actually hate each other... They're not in love. They're a little... Mr. Pecuchet, if you write that, you know very well, we'd be ruined. My job is to inform, Madame. That's all. Yes or no? Are Gigi and Charly going to get married? - They're not in love. - They're not right for each other. It's just a question of what? A hundred times a hundred per head each night? Have I guess right? We've invested too much time in this affair to allow it to fall apart. - Mr. Pecuchet... - There are other interests at stake. I have a letter here from a Mister Antonin Biffard, a Lille industrialist, who has paid you 30 million for the right to manufacture Gigi and Charly dolls in wedding costumes for us. That's your loss. The price will be their future. If the Pop Fianc?s don't get married, then 4 million dolls already dressed up in wedding clothes will remain on our hands. Well... I recall that Mr. Biffard has always been friendly to our paper. Evidently, Charly and Gigi's marriage would breathe new life into their careers. If they get married, all of your competitors will be easily acquired. But Charly and Gigi will never accept this! I assure you that they will accept it! They'll get married. I promise you that, Mr. Pecuchet. So does that mean... I knew that wisdom would ultimately prevail. Mr. Pecuchet, our Simon, actually, isn't very strong. Couldn't you... That's of no interest. Keep it just in case. This is defamatory! I demand you omit those remarks from your column. - It's disgusting! - That's exactly what it is, old lady. - Gigi, talk about life as a newlywed. - And your private life with Charly. Will you grow old together? Or lead a separate life? To each their own? To each their own. And together. It all depends... It's the springtime of our lives. And we smie at all we meet. Make a springtime complaints. Fallen on hard times and deep sorrow, The shops full of vintage junk, The jewelry, The marvellous combs. Everything should be fine. But their colors will never last, Go on fucking with my heart. That stitches it up, Thanks to them, I've become A new industry. Only I haven't become a hit. Only feebly passing. The longest, the gloomiest, The most idle of days. For me, there's little more to do, Even when alcohol Is flowing freely. To get him to kiss me, I try in vain. To give some kind of meaning to my life, Long tomorrows. Charly... Do you love me? No. Me, neither. It didn't seem like that displeased you, at least. Yeah. Yeah, since I was fantasizing, while I was screwing you, that I was screwing that girl who was screaming yesterday in the 3rd row. She had to be thirteen, at least. And I, Charly, when you were holding me in your arms, I saw in your eyes a man who wanted to kick me out of his bed... Close to madness... Charly...? You love me? No. Me, neither. Then, Charly, what are we gonna do? I don't know. We could... We could get divorced. Divorced? And then, Gigi... And then, go away, each of us on our own... Go away on a world tour! And perhaps, in an ideal city, we could meet again. Aren't you Gigi? Charly! How you've changed. You've got the look of someone lost who has no more strength to call for help. And you... you look like a poor dog. A poor, sad dog. A child, who has lost her childhood. Thanks, Charly. I kiss your hand. And I, yours. And now, we're going to live together, the two of us, however we please, without getting married! - Happily! Happily! - Yeah... Fuck this prefab, married-for-life! And sham vows at the town hall! - Charly! - Oh! I'm trapped, Gigi! But, Charly... Charly... someday, we'll love each other, maybe. Ah... Someday... or another. Or never. Charly... Fortune's wheel makes another turn. Ratings for Gigi and Charly as a couple are falling. Everything's gone south. So now, "The Poor Idols' Lament". Hear this lament, Let's hear it, beloved audience Of Charly and Gigi. By all of you, abandoned! Charly le Surineur, solo, Was so renowned, The same goes for Gigi la Folle. Once she?d had a real name. Then one day, Fortune abandoned them. They didn't lose heart, They united their voices, They got engaged and became the young Pop Newlyweds. They became the nation's number one Idols. Once you're on the right track, you'd better hold on tight. Because Fortune, As everybody knows, Has got just one wheel. Has got just one wheel. Gigi, by opening up her multicolored umbrella in the scene has brought misfortune raining down on our heads. Just so, Rosine, "whoever opens an umbrella is asking for rain." And "days of plenty are followed by days of scarcity." So much money was involved... And all lost! And where did it go?! Into whose pockets? We still have, all the same, a nice bank account anyway. And money needs to be constantly risked in this game... which isn't very conducive to the wellbeing of the gambler! But I always said that there wouldn't be anything left for us to gamble on if we didn't gamble... Some professionals, we are! We take all the risks on our shoulders. What a job! The only badge of honor we get is to honor debt. We've got to come up with an idea to drive up business. Find the ends of the loose threads that are all tangled up in our hair and around our necks, before it drives us crazy! It's me. Me. I have the solution. Whatever you may have, Simon, you're long dead... finished. No, Rosine. No, Micheline. You were talking about loose threads? I've got quite a few in my cap that really need to be pulled out. Gigi and Charly are finished. Simon, too. Okay. But... Gigi, Charly and Simon... no. It's just a matter of creating a pop trio, and letting everyone think that between Gigi and me... Or even better, that Charly is jealous for no reason. Who would believe that but you, Simon? That you'd be able to take the place of Charly in Gigi's heart? They'll believe it... They'll assume it. They'll imagine it. And let them think that I've bewitched her. I'm Simon le Magicien, aren't I? Simon! I can tell... I can tell... You have succeeded? You convinced them?! Yes, Marguerite. Genevi?ve, poor Nyasse... Success. Then at last I'm going to have a hit! Together, both of us, we'll rise to the top! Yes. Yeah, I'm going to climb so high, this time... - "We're going..."! - I'm going... No. I..., poor Nyasse. But... aren't we aren't we supposed to be the new couple in the song - who're gonna replace Gigi and Charly? - No. No. No. You have nothing of what it takes, poor Nyasse, to be an idol. Nothing. But you'll lead Pop Idols' new fan club. Pol Idols? Gigi, Charly and Simon. And Simon is the lover of Gigi who cheats on her husband. Simon? Traitor! I was the one who pulled you out of yourself when you were nothing but a rat, dragged down in his misery and his confusion, not even daring to raise his head toward the little summit from whence you'd tumbled! Stop! Listen, Genevi?ve. Be reasonable. Isn't it true that one couple can't be replaced by another one? - Stop! - It's worth thinking about. - Stop! - Listen... Fine. Genevi?ve! So our story ends, ladies and gentlemen. - Shut up. - She'll be fired, I assure you! Time will tell. The Pop Idols, burnt out... were wiped out even before they existed. They admit it, ladies and gentlemen! You are witnesses! It was a sabotage! Enough. That's enough. We say goodbye to you, ladies and gentlemen. But before sinking into oblivion, Gigi, Charly and myself, the following fable, would like to share with you. It's called "The 14th of July". It hasn't got a moral. On the 14th of July... Y?-y?! National! ...holiday... the General, stout and long-nosed, could utter words to make you giggle. He could stand there on his big feet with his tiny ears, saluting a Major who hadn't been cut in half. The soldier dies! Oh! To get a load of that, they've all come to Champs-?lys?es to watch! On the 14th of July, Y?-y?! National! ...holiday... Me? I took my umbrella out into the sunlight and I went up to the fruit market to buy one orange. You know what they say: It's good for you to have one every day at breakfast. And I got lost in a panic! But just look, you don't say! There goes the postman! I'm telling you, a motorbike! He said to me, "Climb on behind. "I'm delivering you to Champs-?lys?es." So, I told him, finally, "I don't mind if I do." And I made the most beautiful entrance in the world passing through the Arc du Triomphe This caused them all to become so jealous! They were howling at me like they wanted to string me up! Yay! It's the 14th of July! Y?-y?! National...! ...holiday... Yet, behold! Suddenly, behold! The luminous, radiant, blazing, Y?-y?! Wow, wow, wow! Charly, Wow, wow, wow! comes along to present me his head, chopped off. I was wandering through the airwaves, where I spied the monstrous beast and his shadow whose stirrings are able to leave you blind drunk, and whose changing shape is able to render you a fortune! Who turns right around who must be concealed... from the eyes. You'd try to get away if you knew how. What a sight in the desert of the airwaves. And who devours those... who can't answer the question that it poses this way: "What's the harm?" It's the beast itself. A monster the likes of which - can only be passed around. - Right! Well, look around! Just look around. The monster's on the loose! He's gonna put on the best show! On the 14th of July... Y?-y?! National...! ...holiday... Well, I could meet up with you and present you my head, chopped off. It was on the 14th of July that we first met each other, And to the music of studded shoes That hit the pavement in quick step, while all the kids were dancing! While we were making out, worshipping each other, While we were making love, That's when all the soldiers and rifles in France, They all went AWOL to dance the Waikiki, And then they ripped off the medals they'd been given They're gonna fuck, who else? Charly de Gaulle! It was on July 14th that I met you both, I was wearing my smoking jacket, my patent leather shoes. We danced the jerk and we danced the Waikiki. We hit the floor without complications, And I was flirting with you. Charly suddenly got tired so we went out together, We kept on dancing, We wandered around, We did all the dance clubs, We are going to soar like birds, over the plains, seas and oceans... - And the cities, engulfed in smoke, - Charly? We'll go up in smoke, one with the gods... we'll talk to them a little about what happened down there. - Here! - Charly? One needs... One needs, all the same, a strong stomach to live through what we have. Charly... - Charly? - Oh, Gigi... We will go there. Yes, later. Both of us. Go to this little nook at the end of the world, where I've prepared a bed, where I will serve you, where you'll serve yourself. But right now, let me go! Let me go where the bird idly dreams who's gone up in smoke... Charly... Charly... Charly! It was... the 14th of July... Y?-y?... National... holiday... Eat. Eat. An apple? The fruit of life, just one bite from which a woman took to forget her unfaithful friend. To forget? To lose? To find, too To find... Simon... Oh, Simon! subtitles: depositio
