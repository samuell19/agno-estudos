We're almost at the pass. If we can just cross over that... Hang in there, Yoki! Yoki! Run! Mum! Mum! MUSHISHI Oh, try over at the village headman's house. Thank you. Yes? Who is it? I'm a traveller. The snow has blocked my way. I was hoping I could ask for a single night's lodging. Oh, you must be exhausted. You're welcome to stay here, if you don't mind a place like this. I haven't the slightest idea why, but he licked the frozen chopsticks with his tongue! The moment he did, his lips and tongue stuck to them and they just wouldn't come off! So we yanked 'em off and his lips and tongue tore in half! I am Ginko, a humble mushishi on my way to Obaiwao to pay my respects to the Odaishi. I thank you greatly for letting me stay under your roof for tonight. Travellers need to look out for one another. You are welcome to stay here. There are other guests here, too. Come down for some sweet potato porridge after you've unpacked. Thank you for everything. For someone with grey hair... your voice is too young. I always thought mushishi were old. I'm Bunzo, of Shibayama. I'm on my way to the Takaichi in Obaiwao too. This is my trade. Pleased to meet you. Winter nights are long. What do you say to some entertainment? No, thank you. Hey, I'm not gonna cheat a mushishi! Come on! Oh, Mushishi. The lady of the house asks to see you. Right in here. You will have to speak very loudly if you sit there. Please come over here. Thank you. I would like you to examine some people. Of course. But by "examine," do you mean they are ill? If so, then an herbalist or a doctor might be better... Sakuji! Makino! Right! And then Take, our maid. They all share an ear affliction. As you can see, our village sits at the bottom of a deep valley. It is a quiet village without wind. Every few years, whenever there is a heavy snowfall, everything turns completely silent. Supposedly, on such nights, even voices start sounding sad and faint, and before you know it, all sound has disappeared from your ears. Sound... disappearing? It's long been said that mushi are the cause of this. I see. Does it affect both ears? No, just one. I can hear out of this one. Same here. Most people here are deaf in one ear. I once thought it wasn't that bad of a problem... but when you lose an ear, you lose the ability to walk straight. And one wrong step on the mountain paths around here can be fatal. Indeed. Un? As in the Buddhist chant. They're mushi that eat sound. They eat sound? They usually live in forests, but because snow absorbs noise they must've come down to this village in search of sound. There are quite a lot of them here. It's too dark. I don't see anything at all... Once they've eaten up all the sound, they leave the swarm and latch onto animals like parasites. Parasites? They enter an ear. Did you know there's an organ inside the ear that looks like a snail? These mushi eat all the sound that enters it. Is this enough hot water? That's hot! What is this?! Rock salt and kindled senburi. Oh! I can hear! I hear perfectly! - Please give this to the others. - I will! And you'll want to spray some in the attic. I will! It's 10 sen for 10 packets. It should be enough for one winter. But for those who want reassurance, 10 more will last you to spring. My wife and I will take 20! - I'll take some, too! - Me too! I haven't asked you your name yet. My name is Ginko. You can see them? There's nothing to fear. They can't do much harm while they're glowing like that. Drink it. It'll help you heal. My name is Yoki. Get better so you can leave. Last night was a real surprise. It was the first time I've witnessed a mushishi at work. The reason I asked you to stay is because there's one other person. Her symptoms are nothing like what the others had... Hers are different? Both of her ears have been affected. Shut up! Be quiet! Maho. This is Ginko, a mushishi. This is Maho, my granddaughter. She's been this way since last autumn. When these horns sprouted, she lost her normal hearing and began hearing things she'd never heard before. Things she'd never heard before? Whispers... Loud roars... Quiet sounds, similar to a broken bell's ringing... Countless bells ringing in unison... She says she hears these things through her horns. It's possible this is the doing of a mushi called "Ah." Huh? It's said they might be the "exits" for the sounds the Un eat, but we don't really know. Could that medicine help her? No, this isn't a mushi inside her ear. Then... how? Well, we need to know what we're dealing with first. Well? Is it any quieter now? This smoke keeps the mushi away. I'm Ginko. A mushishi. Mushi? Do mushi talk this loud? Each one has a soft whisper, but when there are so many of them... They all swirl like echoes as they flow inside you. I think. How did those horns begin to grow? I covered-- I covered my ears. Because my mother always used to. Maho... Don't forget your mother's voice... I can't even hear my own voice anymore... Can you hear me, Maho? Can you hear my voice? Your mother covered her ears? My daughter's final days were terrible. The sounds kept her awake, and she grew weaker and weaker... There was nothing we could do for her. When your daughter passed away, what happened to her horns? We covered her face with a cloth, but when we put her in the coffin, I heard something rattle around. At first, I thought someone had given her coins as an offering, but then I caught a glimpse of a horn that had come off. Could I see the horns? This is hard for me to ask, but it would require digging up her grave. Our relatives decided to have her cremated to avoid any rumours. In her grave are only a few bones. We secretly cremated her body deep in the mountains. Hey. Let me in. Wow. It's roomier than I thought. Have you seen any horns? Have you seen your mother's horns anywhere? I'd like to help you and anyone else who might end up like you and your mother. I want to be able to help. You get to look. That's all. Your mother's horn? Maho... Don't forget your mother's voice... Can you hear me, Maho? Can you hear my voice? My mother's voice wouldn't stop going through my head. Her voice scared me, even though I loved her so much. So this is their nest. If these clockwise ones are Un then the Ah must be counter-clockwise. This one is clockwise. So is this one. Not this one, either. Here we are! This mushi enters the head when one's breathing and pulse are quiet. When one is sleeping, for instance. Then it clings to the deepest parts of the memory. Because she placed her mother's horn to her forehead so soon, Her mother's lingering voice must've entered Maho. Is such a thing possible? This is what it was making. Is that her horn? Where did you get it? From Maho? Look closely. The tip is starting to twist. It's turning into a shell. A shell? My guess is that it'll probably become an Un. Ahs ate Uns' silence and produced more Uns. To think that it was her voice that's been ringing in Maho's head... That's because it echoed, overlapped, and resonated until it lost the essence of her voice and became pure noise. How can we fix it? I think Maho has to do it herself. Herself? How? Maho! Say something! Maho! Was the remedy too effective? Maho! Are you all right? Maho! Maho! Maho! Thank goodness. She should be better now. Better? I'm not sure what you mean. The plug is gone. The Ah has left her. Oh! Her horn! Thank you! I'm not sure how I can repay you for this... No, it was nothing. Things have only returned to how they should be. Those fish... It's because of the mushi that live in the pond. You must never come here at night or dawn. Mushi? The mushi I speak of are visible to some, but not to others. They're not like illusions or mirages. They're a different form of life. But they can affect us, so you must stay away. Yoki. Surely your leg is better by now. I assume you have a home to return to. And you need to tell your relatives about your mother. I don't have a home. I always travelled with my mum, selling things. Plus, my leg still hurts when I walk. All the fish in the pond are white. And they all have one eye. Just like your hair and eye... This is what happens with continued exposure to the pond's light. That's why you must leave. Does that mean you'll lose your other eye if you stay here? Strangely, there are no eyeless fish. That must be how it works. What are those mushi called? The ones that resemble darkness are Tokoyami. Another kind gives off a silver light at dawn and reduces the Tokoyami back to their normal size. So there's a mushi that eats Tokoyami? I don't know if they have a name or not, but I call them Ginko. Ginko... Oh, you're all here. Hey, Ginko. How've you been? Same as always, Taira. I had a real hard time with the plants in Onagasawa. Tell us about it, Ginko. I thought it was over in spring? Give me a break, Nankei. So, how's your love life been lately? Huh?! He's had no luck at all! Huh?! He hasn't had any luck for two years now. And what would you know?! That widow puts out for everyone! Sometimes my mail cocoon mixes up my letters and I can't read it. It's annoying. I have the same problem. It's from old lady Tama at Tanyu's place. That old hag? What's it say, Ginko? She wants me to go there. Makes sense, you are Tanyu's favourite. That's right, you stud! Well, it's been a while since I've heard a good story. Oh, I haven't seen him before. Is he new here? He's not one of us, Ginko. He's just taking shelter from the rain. Did you see that pot? What do you think's inside? Buckwheat seeds, maybe kudzu starch. A body. The dead body of his wife. There's nothing in it. He says he's going to catch a rainbow in it and take it home. You're trying to catch a rainbow? Are you going to mock me too? What kind of rainbow? Koro, huh? It's written as "rainbow" and "man." My father gave it to me. Strange name, isn't it? I wouldn't say that. I only have katakana for my name. When I was a boy, my dad and I saw this rainbow. It was no ordinary rainbow! It danced and slinked like a snake! Oh? You don't have to believe me. No one else does. It's called a "Kouda." That's the rainbow you're looking for. It's written as "rainbow" and "snake." Wait! You know about it?! Normal rainbows only appear when the sun is behind you, but Koudas can appear at any time. And the colours are reversed. You certainly know a lot! I read about it at Tanyu's house, the place I'm going to now. Tanyu? Is she a mushishi too? Hmm, how do I explain... In each generation of her family is someone infested with odd mushi. I guess you could say the family is possessed by them. To break the curse, they write down stories about mushi being killed or sealed away. When they do this, the letters turn to ink and the mushi leave the body. Which is why Tanyu keeps a record about mushi. So, even though the mushi eat away at her, she must cherish them and seal them away in writing. How unfortunate. Say, Ginko. Do you think I could see this record too? Wait for me! No, you'd probably have to be a mushishi. Oh, and your pot won't be of any use. You should sell it off. Wait! Hey, boy. I hear you're an orphan. The lady mushishi said you don't have any parents. What do you say? Want to work for me? Nui! Nui! Yuck! Disgusting! Stupid mushi! Sometimes, when you walk in the mountains alone at night, everything will suddenly seem to go dark, the stars will vanish, and you'll lose your sense of direction. Next, you'll forget your own name and your old memories. This is because the Tokoyami are nearby. What happens then? You need to remember a name. Any name at all. And then think of it as your own name. That's all? But once it happens, you'll forget everything that happened during your previous name. I don't want to forget about my mum I planted a stick to mark her grave, but if I forget about that, then no one will ever remember her. And if I forget that she even existed... What is it, Nui? Nui's hiding something. There's some reason she doesn't want me here. The mushi that live in the pond... Mushi eating other mushi? That's crazy. Come out, Tokoyami! Ginko! I'm not afraid of you! That fish... It disappeared... Yoki! What are you doing?! I told you the light's not good for you! The reason there are no eyeless fish is because they disappear when they lose both eyes... Did you know that, Nui? They don't disappear. The Ginkos' light turns life eaten by the Tokoyami into light. I did a lot of research. Pulling a one-eyed fish out of the pond and keeping it away from the light didn't work. Once a fish has turned white, it will eventually lose both eyes and become Tokoyami. By the time I realized that, I had already been overexposed to the light. Then you're also going to...? We have intelligence, so we can run from what is avoidable. Understand, Yoki? That's why you must leave at once. No! I have nowhere to go! Why didn't you run away sooner?! You only cause me grief. Please, just leave. No! This is my home now! No. This place is for me and the Tokoyami. Not you! Now I must end this... Nui... Nui! I decided I'm going to stay here! Don't worry! I won't get in your way! Stop, Yoki! Stay away! Nui, your eye... It's bleeding... You must stay away. I told you to stay away! Nui! The Tokoyami! Yoki! What have you done? Nui? Where are you, Nui? Go back. What about you? Let's go together. No. The Ginko is awakening. That's a Ginko? The eyeless fish at the bottom of the Tokoyami... Do not be blinded by fear or anger. Everything is as it is. That is all. Nui. Is that you, Nui? Your hands aren't warm or cold. Your hands are still warm. Not just your hands. I no longer have my eyes, but whenever you look at me, I feel warm, almost as if the sun is shining on me. Oh, how nice that felt, after living next to such a dark pond. Now, Yoki. Close one eye before you go. Give one to the Ginko... if you want to escape the Tokoyami. But you must keep the other eye firmly shut... if you want to see the light of the sun again. The moon... It just set recently. How many times is that now? I can't remember. My name is... Ginko... Doesn't look like we can expect any rain here. There's a "crown" on that mountain. It should rain there tomorrow. Oh? Impressive. I've been at this for five years. I've at least learned to read the rain. Five years, huh? Koudas are most likely raindrops mixed with Kouki. Kouki? The source of mushi life, basically. Oh? Then that must be the light of human life. Electricity's already made it out here... Soon, nights in Japan are going to look like day. It's bright... Huh? That eye... Oh. One is a glass eye. Oh? Were you born that way? I don't remember. I have no memory of my childhood. Oh... KARIBUSA Any reply? Well, it is a big place. That's for sure. Ginko. Who's he? He's Koro. He's travelling with me, in search of a Kouda... He can wait outside. I'm used to waiting. You took a long time. I told you to come quickly. I saw the letter at the Koshindo in Shimoyaguchi. I can't just run over two mountains. This is an emergency. Tanyu is calling for you. Has something happened to her? I've never been so careless in all my life. What in the world happened? See for yourself. Wait, Tama! Stay calm. What's happened? Has it spread? It had always stayed below her thighs. May I touch her? She's lost all feeling in her feet, and the boundary is burning hot. The colour is slowly moving upward. It was a month ago when a mushishi who Takiji knew visited. The mushishi was a blind woman, and she was with a mute man who didn't seem to be her husband. They'd been told they would be paid well for stories about rare mushi being destroyed, but it wasn't true. Then I told them it was for record purposes only, the man suddenly acted dejected. But the woman began to talk, her attitude never changing. Long ago... there were mushi called Tokoyami in a mountain pond... At the bottom of this pond was a mushi called Ginko. My name? Yes. It's an eyeless fish that lives at the bottom of the Tokoyami. You've never heard of it? No. She knew me? She said she didn't know about you, either. However, that night... when Tanyu was writing the story down, she suddenly felt strange and fell bedridden. Let me read the story Tanyu wrote. Very well. Afterwards, in exchange for the story, they asked to see the Komyakusuji maps passed down in this family. Komyakusuji? Apparently Kouki heals her body. They looked at the maps for less than an hour in the storeroom and then went on their way. These are all records of mushi I've only seen a fraction of everything there is. Many mushi are no longer seen anymore and there are few reports of new kinds these days. May I use the desk? It's Tanyu's desk. Normally, it would be no place for someone like you. This is Tanyu's writing. Of course it is! I mean to say that it's nice handwriting. My village clung to the slope of a mountain. That year, a disease contaminated the soil of our rice fields that had been passed down for generations. After two years of failed crops and poor weather the fields began to wither away. One day, while I was away on mushishi work, my husband went through my belongings and saw a map indicating a Komyaku in the area. He decided to try irrigating the village's fields with water from behind an old deity shrine. This water contained Kouki of a Komyakusuji. The rice fields sprung back to life. What is this?! It stinks like saké! Stop! Don't touch it! Kouki is the mushis' source. In other words, it is life itself. It was not meant to be touched. And so the Tokoyami came to reside in the pond. Alone, I headed into the mountains, found the pond, moved into an old shrine nearby, and began studying the Tokoyami. One day, I came across a boy named Yoki who had lost his mother in a flash flood and took him back to the shrine. Yoki? He was the same age as my son, who had vanished with my husband. All alone, he... Ginko! What is that?! I don't know! What is this?! Those mushi, they're...! Humans coexist with many kinds of mushi! However, those who become mushishi harbour abnormal mushi somewhere inside them! That is why you can see them and sometimes attract them! Are you saying the mushi inside me is Tokoyami?! Look! The letters are blotting! Oh no! Not the other scrolls too! They're the records of all the past generations! What is happening?! If the mushi that Tanyu sealed away are breaking free now something may have happened to her! I didn't read how she gets rid of them! Did she tell you how?! Tanyu! Oh no! Tanyu! Are you all right?! Tanyu... Have the Tokoyami taken over her? No. This is the forbidden mushi that's always been inside her. They've been released, and are now attacking the host! But that would kill them too! Mushi don't use logic! They simply eat whatever they see! If we can't get rid of them, can we at least quiet them? These mushi belong to Tanyu. Only she can control them! But look at her now! What are we going to do?! Open a blood path! I heard that red blood can wash away black ink. Heard from whom?! That might kill her! She's halfway gone as it is. This is our only option now! Tanyu... Ginko. Return to the storeroom. Find the Tokoyami that devoured Tanyu's writing! What? You can control it! How?! I never even heard of it before! It's your mushi. Ask yourself. Sorry to intrude. Hey, Ginko. Oh, perfect timing. Give me a hand. This won't do any good. Now what? Ginko. The plaster's ready, but was it really okay to demolish that wall? Hey, the plaster... - Koro! Go back! - Huh? What's wrong? Never mind me! Go outside and plaster the walls! Seal the storeroom! Ginko! You come too! Hey, Ginko! Hey, Ginko! Shut the doors. Okay. If the mushi inside me are calling for you then which will eat and which will be eaten? It's rock hard. It won't go in. Someone! Hey! Someone! Oh! Old lady! Ginko is in real trouble inside the storeroom! Help me! Start a bath! Hurry! Bath? - Open that door! - Oh, this one?! - Place her in the tub! - Right! Gently! This area isn't hardened yet, but it's so close to the heart... Tear some cloth to make a tourniquet! Wrap it around her arm! Tie it tight as soon as the blood turns red! O-Okay. These are definitely Tanyu's letters. There are a few inkblots too. But where is the Tokoyami? Yoki... There? Yoki... Tokoyami... What are you wandering in search of? Yoki... Hurry... Before the Ginko awakens... Who are you? Your hands are still warm... Whenever you look at me, I feel warm, almost as if the sun is shining on me. Koro! Tie it, quickly! Tanyu! Hey! Say something! Hey! Ginko? Ginko?! He's breathing! But what happened to him?! Ginko caught the Tokoyami that crawled out. Does that mean it's eaten him? No. Those aren't Tokoyami. They're my letters that sealed the Tokoyami away. Tama. Bring my chopsticks. What the hell is this?! I'm releasing my letters from the Tokoyami. Close the door. Tama. Scroll 1853, Chapter 1! Scroll 6237, Chapter 1! Scroll... 2540... Tanyu! Huh? What happened? What's that? It doesn't look very tasty... Stone honey. Honey stored inside a stone room. Bitter! Worker bees feed this to the queen bee. It's wasted on the likes of you. Tanyu, he doesn't seem any better. Will Ginko be okay? I returned all the letters to where they belong, but half of Ginko is still in the darkness that was always in him. Only he knows if he'll be eaten by it or if he can crawl back out of it. Have you heard about how to get rid of the Tokoyami? The lady mushishi only broke the dam to wash away the impure Kouki. Once it washed away, a spring of Kouki was left behind. And that's how the lady mushishi survived. Yoki! Yoki! Where are you?! Yoki! Don't go! My husband and son are gone! Yoki! Stay with me! My husband and son washed away with the Tokoyami! Nui... Hurry up, Koro! Koro! What an annoying hag. Don't call me like I'm your dog! He responds when we call his name now, but he's not fully there yet. Isn't there something you can do? Leave it to Tanyu. She knows more about mushi than anyone in Japan. We have maps of where to find Komyakusuji, but I don't know if they always flow through those spots. Then how can we find them? Various conditions cause them to move, disappear, and reappear, so all you can do is follow their trails. Their trails? I think the only way is to wash the Tokoyami off with Kouki. Just as the lady mushishi does. Just who is she to Ginko? Should we really be all the way out here? Once Tama starts her Gidayu stories, there's no stopping her. I feel bad for Kiyo and the others. Is this spot okay? Thank you. Oh, how nice it feels! I haven't been outside in so long. I even saw Kiyo singing a love song while she was dusting. I never would've imagined it. Imagined what, Ginko? That you would ever smile in that mansion. Don't worry. I cry too. Not as much as I used to, though. I don't like Gidayu and those old stories. People and children always die in them. Ginko. This is our journey. The journey of Tanyu, who stays in one place, and Ginko, who never stays put... Just where will they go? We'll just have to see. The moon... It just set recently. How many times is that now? Ginko... Well, goodbye. Give Tanyu my regards. Yes. Take good care of Ginko. You can count on me! Bye. Well, shall we go, Ginko? Okay, let's go. Yoki! Where have you gone, Yoki? Yoki! Yoki... Yoki... My dad was a bridge carpenter, Ginko. One time, he took me to see a bridge over the Nishiki River in Suo. I remember him staring at the bridge and not moving at all. But it was a beautiful bridge. Then you should see it again, instead of chasing a rainbow. Oh, but the rainbow was a bridge. Between me and my father. I can't go home until I find it. I thank you for everything you've done. But I feel bad always relying on you for help, without any way to repay you. Don't be silly. We just happen to be walking in the same direction. Don't worry about it. People part when their paths part. - Such nice weather. - It's hot. So, you're going to be a carpenter? Yeah. That I am. You don't seem the carpenter type. But I wish you luck. Say. What does this hot spring heal? Let's see... Headaches, backaches, stiff shoulders, nerves... It heals just about anything. Can you think of anything else? It doesn't work on hangovers. It'd be the world's greatest hot spring if it cured that! Where do you come from? We came over three mountains to the east. Where are you headed? I'm not sure. Sounds like you're catching clouds. Isn't that the truth! Oh! Can you see?! I can. I can see. I can see! Soothing yourself by curing others... That's a good sign of recovery. That's a relief! The Komyakusuji follows the ridge and wraps around the basin. What you see shining below are springs. What if there are ponds of Kouki in that swamp? I smell rain. It'll come soon. Where do we wait? Even if we find it, it'd be too hard to move on this slope. Let's climb down. The sun is about to set behind the western slope. We can see it looking from the east. Right. With the sun to our backs, we might see normal rainbows instead. - Let's hurry. - Right! But now there's no telling where the springs are. Plus we can barely see the trail now. What do we do, Ginko? Is it raining? You don't see them? Huh? See what? There are so many... It's a swirl! Whirl? What's whirling? The mushi are slowly starting to swirl around. Doesn't the air seem especially heavy? What is this? Perhaps it's better that you can't see them. Look at that, Ginko! That's it! Hurry, Ko! Hey! Ko! Wait! Stop! Okay, now to dry it with body heat. You seem to be in a really good mood. I somehow feel refreshed. I'm not sure if that was lucky or unlucky... But I definitely saw it. The sun was behind it, too. Should we wait a while longer? This seems to be a good spot. When all the conditions are right... No, I'm fine. I'm going home now. I don't know if I'll be any good, but I'm going to try being a bridge carpenter. I see. That sounds good. Tanyu did her utmost for you. Tanyu always does her utmost at everything. Oh. That makes sense. That's why... I can't tell her I love her. You love her? Then you should... Is something there? Mushi. They're stirring. Could this be...?! Let's go, Ko! Hurry! I'm starving... I haven't eaten anything since last night. Let's buy some rice and miso at the nearest farm. Parting ways on empty stomachs would be a pathetic memory. Well, this is it. Take care. You too, Ginko. Where are you headed next? Hmm. There was one other Komyakusuji near here, so I think I'll check it out. I see. If you ever find yourself in my village, will you come visit me? Of course. Assuming I manage to live that long. Thanks for everything. Don't be silly. Ginko! You'll be alive! You'll visit my village alive! Tanyu's legs will be healed, and you'll be travelling together! And then you'll both visit my village! I know it! I just know it! Excuse me. Do you know if... Tokoyami... Yoki... You came back... I know you're looking at me. Because it's warm, like sunshine... Nui... Yoki... You really came back, Yoki... Your hands are warm... Nui... What are you...? How can this be? Inside you... Inside you is a Ginko... Did you become a Ginko, Yoki? You've become a Ginko and come to... The Ginko is awakening... No! Stop! This should be a good spot. I get rid of mushi all the time... but I don't have much experience summoning them. Even so, I think she'll be fine here. Nui...
