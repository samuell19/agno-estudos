So late in the night Oh! Mr.Ashok I really got late today I went a little far away Rupa indeed You've gone Very far away So far away that returning back from there is Very difficult! Please mind it Ashok I am not a small girl to forget way back! The problem is that you re not a girl but a Maiden ..In youth going astray won't take much time! What do you mean by that A Maiden staying away from the home all the night ls more than enough to make inmates hang their heads in shame! Yes Rupa! I am being forced to say this! The path which you re going is the path of ruin destruction! Why Don't you say it clearly that you Don't like my meeting with Raj! Very gentleman will dislike meeting such persons! Whose intentions are to bring ill repute to innocents! Why are you surprised Raj is not interested in you but on your status! He isn't eyeing you but your wealth ..wealth only wealth! Wrong! Absolutely wrong!! I can never believe this! I Don't know why you re trying to bring down my opinion on Raj! Rupa I am afraid if the time brings you down from its opinion! You Don't know Raj I understand Raj better than you! 18 yrs of young age in which there's not a single day of experience! How can you recognise a crook Raj in 4 days Do you have any evidence of his crookedness You. Evidence You yourself are an evidence! Before Raj came you had etiquette! But now rudeness! Even then I think its my responsibility to advice you! I Don't like I know it Very well what you like! You wish that I must forever remain as your model! You wish that your lifeless paintings get colored by the blood of others aspirations! You wish.. I Don't have any intentions other than your well being! But I never knew that in the sudden surge of young blood! You'll put blame on your benefactor also ..Who took you out from the streets and put you on the sky ..And I can't see you crash landing from there! Very good! If you want me to be chained to your obligations! Let it be like that Here after I ll never meet Raj! Never I ll never meet him! Neeli inform Rupa about my arrival! Sir!..She isn't at home! Why Where has she gone Sir That's I Don't know! I've understood! But I want to know the cause of her anger! Wait Neeli! Tell Rupa for which crime am I being punished Which crime have I committed so That she doesn't want to meet me Tell Rupa that Raj will not Go away without meeting her! He ll never go! Even if Even if he loses his life! Neither you arrive nor does happiness We just wait in anticipation, thirsty eyes wait for you, thirsty eyes wait for you, Huge storms are hidden in these eyes, Neither you arrive nor does happiness I swear on the pain called love, I tried using my heart for love, I swear on the pain called love, I tried using my heart for love, why blame others for the pain, why blame others for the pain, when people close to me cannot see eye to eye why blame others for the pain, when people close to me cannot see eye to eye Neither you arrive nor does happiness Tell me o heartless one, why are you away from my sight? Tell me o heartless one, why are you away from my sight? Just say and I'll get up, Just say and I'll get up, I'm seated only because of you Neither you arrive nor does happiness Thank God You've come Otherwise I had already decided that only my corpse will go from here! Let your enemies die! Rupa the enemies are Very hard nosed for death! I Don't know why Ashok thinks - ..That you Don't love me but you love only my wealth Rupa I love everything that is yours! Even That style which made me suffer so much from your separations! Ashok is thinking correctly! He should think like that only! A poor man's love will also be poor! I didn't know that my love will be weighed in the scale of wealth! Raj it isn't like that! To close the mouth of this Society You've to open your mouth! What do you mean by that If I give back the wealth I had got from Ashok to himself! Your love for me won't diminish isn't it Come on tell Raj! Why are you silent Why Don't you reply me I never expected a question like this from you! I Don't have cars and bungalows to make you happy! But I definitely have a heart filled with love! I may never be able to present you with gold jewellery! But "Real Pearls of Love"! Which the World calls it as "Tears"! I can shed it all my life for you! Raj take me away from here! Raj I can't stay here anymore! Raj take me away from here! Ll ll wait for you tomorrow night at 10 Pm Be there or I may be left awaiting all my life Hey! Mad girl! I was waiting for long for this day to come! Very nicely You've kept your promise Rupa I never expected this from you that you And I too never expected That You'll falsely accuse a poor man And try to muffle down his aspirations didn't you see that hapless man's condition Still do you have any doubts on his intentions I am not doubting but I am sure that Poor man's after your wealth Wealth Wealth! Those who are after wealth won't wait so patiently for someone I think You've never see a hunter waiting after throwing a bait But I've seen people staying awake all the night for love! A dacoit to loot someone can keep awake all the night! But he ll not make his eyes sore after crying all night! That's because he doesn't want you to see his real intentions! And moreover he knew the price of his eyes! He was damn sure that You'll follow his eyes! And I am regretting for not going away earlier itself! And why was I still watching the destruction of Poor man's World The World now also is being destructed Only you re not aware of it! It may not happen that your World disintegrates and you become a spectator! How illogically you speak Do you think he braved this cyclone for a few silVer coins Without any doubt! Greed which has lit the fire in his heart What can these real 4 drops of water do against it Moreover he himself is a Typhoon! One who ll drown with not only you but someone else also! Hunter! Dacoit! Thief!You've called him different names! Yet he never ever spoke anything ill against you! isn't it his politeness A greedy man sometimes will use politeness as his weapon Mr.Ashok! I can no more stand you accusing Raj! Just like how you feel your art as half finished without Rupa! Just like that I also feel my life is also half empty without Raj! Tomorrow I am going away with Raj forever When I am sure that he loves only me! Why Don't I take all this with me Madam your necklace lt's in my neck! Be quick! there's Very little time! Madam why Don't you give it a second thought That you You Don't have any right in interfering in my matters! I can look after myself better than you! Pack my things quickly! Rupa! Stop! Rupa still there's time! ..Stop your steps here only! Mr.Ashok Don't waste my time! I am afraid that the time may waste you You re going to a place where Permit me to go there! Raj may be waiting for me on the road Tell that a hungry beast is waiting for its prey! Ashok I can no more tolerate this! Then listen to my last words go! You re trying to play with fire! Even if I shout Don't come with water! Rupa You'll definitely shout.. I may not be able to come! This necklace is alone worth Rs.50 000 Where do you keep it Why Do you have any intention of robbing it he's eyeing your wealth only your wealth not you! If I return back the wealth to Ashok Your love won't diminish isn't it Tell me Raj! Why Don't you reply me Rupa I didn't expect such a question from you! Just one glance and my destiny's star has sunk, A boat is just a boat, even the river banks sink, This is the world, This is the world and I have seen the world, This is the world What did I gain from killing someone's wishes What did I gain What did I gain from killing someone's wishes What did I gain I saw my world turn to ruins I saw my world turn to ruins This is the world The caravan of my heart is being plundered in front of my eyes, The caravan of my heart The caravan of my heart is being plundered in front of my eyes, The caravan of my heart It is the day of judgment end as I have witnessed this day This is the world My blind youth has ruined me Has ruined me My blind youth has ruined me Has ruined me I wasted my life for someone's infidelity I wasted my life for someone's infidelity This is the world and I have seen the world, This is the world Oh!

Why are you quiet why Don't you say something I know that you hate me! You killed Ashok! This is a lie! You're a demoness who eats up her benefactor! Wretched.sinner!
