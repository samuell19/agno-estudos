I I don't I don't want I don't want to go back I don't want to go back alone [everyone]: Going up! What an unfunny joke... How many times till it gets old? You'll never learn... Guys, take it easy! Enough jokes already. Let's take the time to get to know our new student. Gabriel, would you like to introduce yourself? No need to... Sure you need to. Stand up, introduce yourself. [everyone]: Gabriel, Gabriel! Hi, I'm Gabriel. [everyone] Hi Gabriel! I've just moved to S?o Paulo. What happened? The boys threw something at him. Well, you'll get to know each other. Gabriel you can return to your seat. Let's go. You going up or down the street? Up... Wanna tag along? Sure. The keys, Leo. "Delivered". Bye. - Bye Gabriel. - Bye. Well, good-bye to you too. Won't you go all the way down too? I live two blocks up. I come here just to bring Leo. - So, see you tomorrow. - See you. - Bye! - Bye! I'm telling you. Karina was staring at you during the test. That's why she was the last one to leave. You know I don't like her, right? Well... You never like anyone. At least, not someone you told me. I'm your best friend I deserve to know these things. I always tell you about the guys I like, Leo. Long time since you last talked about it. Since Tiago. That I can remember... Don't even get me started on that jerk. Nevermind... May I sit with you? Sure, take a seat. Stand up, Leo. So, already familiar with the school? Well, I found the library. Did you guys do well in the test? I guess so... But Karina didn't. Totally spaced out. Never pays attention to anything. And you? Did well? Yeah, but... - I've always loved math so... - You should help Leo. He's terrible at math... I'd like to see you solve equations in Braille first... Grumpy... Well, that was just a quiz anyway... I can help you with the next one... You should take his help, Leo. There's a new test in two weeks. It'd be a shame to flunk due to Bhaskara... [mumbling] Bhaskara... (*quadratic formula) Would you rather step barefoot on an ant-hill... or find a cockroach inside your pants? Cockroach, of course! Just take out the pants. Gabriel, how's that evidence thing, again? Would you rather swallow a mosquito or lose your entire allowance? Look, remember that to null x... - "Meow Cat Meow?" - Meow! Gabriel! - How's Gabriel like, Gi? - What do you mean? You know... How does he look like? Gabriel? Black hair, my height... ...pale skin, full curly hair, you know? Skinny with real big eyes and he's here... - What's up? - Let's go. - You live around here, right Gi? - By that yellow house over there. I can take Leo home if you want... I don't know... I don't think is necessary... I don't see a problem, Gi. - You sure? - Hu-hum... Cool, 'cause I have to pee! See you guys tomorrow. - See you! - See you! - You there? - Yes. So, keep walking... - Bye! - Bye! Archaic Period. So, guys, since we are studying Greece I'll ask you guys to pair off. But the pairs must be of the same gender. Boys will write about Sparta and girls about Athens. Okay? Come on, let's pair off. - Can I join you? - Sure. Well, Larissa wants to meet at the library. And you guys? We're doing at my place. - Okay, good luck! - Thanks... - You always been like this? - Like what? - Brunette? Or blind? - Blind. From birth. And that's okay? Not always. Sometimes I get mad at the world, you know? - But everyone does. - Yeah. Don't know what I'd do if I were blind. You'd get used to it. But, you see? There are perks to being blind. Like people doing you all kinds of favors. So, you never seen Giovana's face? No... Never. She's funny. I think she likes you. Of course she does. She's my friend. I mean, she has a crush on you. - Shut up, no way! - The way she looks at you... - It doesn't seem like friendship. - Stop it! And you? Don't you like her? No. Got it. I'll take it to the trash can. - See? - What? Favors. Come in. Now I'm ready. - It's hot in here, Leo! - Well, you're in your sweatshirt. - How do you know that? - Huu! I wonder... Okay, I took it off. Leo I need to brush my teeth. Where's the bathroom? Third door from the left. - Third from the left, right? - That's it. [song playing] [the two singing along] "missing"... - It's "desiring", Gi. - Wasn't it "missing"? Of course not. Gi... - Am I handsome? - What? You think that people find me attractive? I think you are. Fine. But how about everyone else? Don't know about the others. You have to ask them. - Let's go? - Yes. - You two here? - We are. - Hurry, I'm hungry. - Sweatshirt again, Gabriel? You two done with the History assignment? We're finishing it today. I see... Bye then! You see the two dots prior to the letter, Gabriel? Those are the capital letters. It reads: weather temperature. Give me your hand... Right. Look: Tropical weather temperature presents inconsistencies. See? That's a hyphen: "inconsistencies". - Bless you. - Thanks! Leo, I forgot my sweatshirt at your place. You can pick it up after class today. Shit. I've gotta go to the dentist today. I'll bring you tomorrow, then. Okay. - Bless you. - Thanks! - Where's Gabriel? - At the dentist. Oh, Gabriel, Gabriel... - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Gi, I want to talk to you. - Okay, do it. Here is not the place. Wow. What's so important you can't say it here? I'll tell you later. Now you got me curious. Tell me. - Is there anyone near? - Everybody's gone. So, what's up Leo? I think I'm in love with Gabriel. Did you hear what I said? I did. I'm thinking. I don't know what to say. And now? Got anything to say? What do you mean by "in love"? Well, in love like boyfriend. Like gay boyfriend? Guess so, right? It's my mom, Leo! It's my grandma's birthday... - and we have lunch... - Gi! I'll stop by you later. Won't even get dessert. I Promise. Okay... Giovana, I can't believe you left me after what I said. I know it's not easy to hear. But, come on... I tell you something that important and you leave me? And I'm positive you ate dessert. Look, I've been asking myself for hours whether or not I should've told you I'm in love with Gabriel. You know you're jealous. Now I don't even want to think about it... Giovana? Leo, I'm sorry. I swear I tried to come earlier. But all my aunts showed up at my grandma's with their endless happy birthdays. And I thought it would never end... Then everyone gathered around me and kept asking me about school and - college... - Gi... What? Do you see any sweatshirt around? No. Are you sure? Under the bed, maybe? Not even... Leo, I'm sorry I left you at school. Are you all right? Yeah.
