"DUET FOR CANNIBALS" Coffee? Bauer asked Tomas to come at 6 p.m. tomorrow. They'd make a work schedule. Getting me in the mood for Bauer? I love you, you know. - You've cut yourself. - It's nothing. I have no time for coffee. I'm supposed to meet some people. See you. I have an appointment with Dr. Bauer. Sit down. Your interest in politics is serious? Yes. You want to learn by working for me? I hope so. - You have a driver's license? - Yes. Do you smoke? I trust you'll be careful with your cigarettes around all these papers. There's a lifetime of work assembled in this room. I don't want it to go up in smoke. - I'm careful. - Good Now then, where shall I begin? I suppose our mutual friend in Berlin has given you an idea of the work. You'll be working chronologically on materials up to my arrival in Sweden. First, there are these papers to read through and sort out. They are mostly letters from my colleagues in the period 1945-47, just after the war. I imagine you'll recognize some of the names. Then, my journals of that period. That'll be somewhat harder. Nice, isn't it? Brecht gave it to me. Where was I? Yes, my journals. I must explain how they can be dated and the meaning of some abbreviations. - You're not paying attention! - Yes, I am. The journals can wait till next week. The letters will keep you busy for now. Shall I start now? Certainly. You've nothing else to do here, have you? One more thing... I hope it goes without saying, that our work here is absolutely confidential. Many people would give a good deal to know what's in these papers. I intend to satisfy their curiosity only when I'm ready. - Is that clear? - Perfectly clear. Have you met my wife? Come darling, don't be shy. This is Tomas. He's going to stay with us for a while. Don't do that! She doesn't like to be touched. Don't pay any attention to her. She needs time to get used to new people. But you'll see, if she likes you, she can be quite friendly. Is she ill? Not exactly. It's hard to explain. You'll have to be patient. Will you clean up that glass before we get to work. His wife's name is Francesca. Bauer told me I might have to live at the house for several weeks because the initial cataloging of his papers has to be done quickly. It just has to be... I've heard that... I don't think you'll find it difficult... - Don't get up! - He might be unwell. It's nothing. I've often seen him do that. It's nothing. Believe me. Go on eating. I hope nothing has happened while I was gone. Darling, I was only teasing. Just a little joke. I thought Francesca came into the library that night. What do you want? She showed me a tape recorder. - More toast? - No thanks. I'd like you to take Francesca For a stroll this morning. She's been ill a long time and I've been too busy to take her anywhere. But shouldn't I be working all day? This is more important. The work can wait. We hardly ever see each other. Don't start that again. - Want something to eat? - I've already eaten. But why do you have to live there? That's what Bauer wants. It's only for a short while. But what do you do there all day? Lots of things. There's always something to do. Oh, I wish you hadn't taken this job. God, what's the matter with you? - All this mess gets on my nerves. - The plate? No, everything. Can't you clean up while I'm gone? It's our mess. I like it. It makes me think of you. Idiot! I can feel the disease Getting worse. The doctors promised at least two years, but I suspect they were wrong. I already have symptoms that shouldn't have appeared for another six months. My biggest worry is how Francesca will survive me. Who will look after her? And what about the political situation? I'll be out for several hours. I expect you to keep my wife company. This time I could think of no grounds for objecting. Fourth Canto. "Between two foods at equal distance and equally tempting "a free man would die of hunger before he brought either to his lips. "So a lamb would stand between The cravings of two fierce wolves in fear of both. "So would a hound stand between two deer. "Therefore, now urged equally by my doubts, I was silent "I neither blame nor commend myself. since it was of necessity "I was silent, but my desire was painted on my face "and with it my question, far more warmly than in plain words..." Go on. "I see well how one desire And another draws you..." - Did you have a good time? - I'll get back to work now. - Any phone calls for me, Tomas? - None. That's peculiar, I'm expecting a very important call from Argentina. - You were here all the time? - Right in this room. With enough attention left from activities with my wife to hear the phone? Do you know who's here tonight? We mustn't disturb their meeting. - Take me for a drive. - Now? Where do you want to go? Anywhere. Just to get out of this house. Too late! They're leaving. Don't say anything. She's locked herself in the car. You must help her, she may do herself harm. I want you to talk to her. Tell her to open the door. Do something! Can't you do anything? I'm sorry. It's a mistake. Go back to bed. - What's he saying? - Don't mind him. What were you saying now? That's all. Just what I've told you. He's got some fatal disease. At least he believes he has. But I'm not so sure. He's full of fantasies of disaster And persecution. The exile's mentality. About her, I know even less. I don't understand what is between them. Be more quiet or you'll have to leave. There are too many crazy people in this world. Let's get out of here. - Just ignore him. - I can't. I'm not impressed by your Arthur Bauer. - Is she very attractive? - Don't be silly. I'm not being silly. I'm trying to understand what I feel. You'll have to leave. Go away! There's so little time left And I have so much to do. My worry about Francesca is interfering with my political work. She should help me instead. He asked me to transmit a highly confidential message to someone. You just have to deliver this envelope. There's no risk in it for you. - You remember exactly what I told you? - Yes. - The car? Color, make, license number? - Yes. - I also want you to wear this hat. - You must be joking. Not at all. What is it, a signal? You could call it that. Why are you wearing that awful hat? Get tonight off? They went to bed early. I just left. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - If my working for Bauer... - It's not that. Don't be angry. Let's go to sleep - I want to stop smoking. - Why don't you? It's a matter of being strong or weak, isn't it? I didn't know you were such a believer in the power of the will. I pleaded with him not to go back. There you are! If you really want this job, you're required to stay here. At any moment I may have work for you, or my wife may need you. - You're here to work, aren't you? - What are you talking about? What else? I have enemies. You're not a spy, are you? People have many disguises. - Don't I look different with them? - Not particularly. Look again. Well, I'll let you off this time. But you'll have to convince Francesca that it's all right. Where is she? Francesca? - What have you both decided? - Nothing. - You were right. She's angry. - Really? That's easy to cure. Don't you interfere! This is between my wife and me. - I won't stand here and watch you... - Why not, since you don't understand? - Tomas! - You see, now she's talking to you. It's easy to manage these things if you know how. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. - Is he listening outside? - Why do you ask that? - Doesn't he frighten you? - No. He's the nicest man in the world. Are you all right? Sure? You don't like me. You're wrong. I do like you. - Then read to me. - What? The same as the other day. "I see well how one desire and another draws you "your eagerness itself binds itself "and does not get breath. "if the right will endures, on what ground does another's violence "lessen the measure of my desert?" - What is it? - I changed my mind. - What do you want to do? - Make believe. - I'm a princess in an enchanted castle. - And I've come to rescue you. Don't be silly. Now let me see. What should you wear? No, that's not right. He's calling me. I'll be right back. Wait! She'll be right back. I must tell you something while she can't hear us. The food. I suspect that the food... What are you whispering about? Nothing. Tomas was telling me about your little game. - If you'll excuse me... - Just a minute. I think Tomas owes me an explanation. - Explanation of what? - Of what you've done with my wife. It's more what you've done with her. I know you've slept together. Last night, for example. - I wasn't here. Wasn't your wife? - She was here. Perhaps you were, too. - Maybe you crept in and out. - I quit. You can go to hell. You can't quit now. See it's all a game. Come on. my boy, humor me. Can't you see that Francesca wants you to stay? Stay... If not for my sake, for hers. - How is it going? - All right. - Except for gaps in the 1953 notebooks. - Show me. I don't know what made me undertake this project. Reviewing one's life is a formidable task. And there are so many secrets I can't reveal. And Francesca. What am I to do with her? That weighs on me so. But you've been a great help to me, Tomas. It's a relief to have you here. Exactly what's the matter with her? If only you could have known her years ago. When we were first married. She was so lively and loving. But now... I know you think I'm harsh with her. But when you get to know her better... A great love is an enormous responsibility. Are you in love, Tomas? I don't know. I think so. Think so! There's no "thinking so" when you really are. I pitied him. Despite his arrogance. Come here! Come here! I'm going to do away with Francesca. There's no point in keeping her alive. It pains me but... Why so silent? You needn't fear me. I don't fear you. There's something so innocent about this art. It almost makes me believe in nonviolence and in human goodness. Will you kill my husband? She gave me a revolver. Ho Chi Minh said that all people are good, only governments are bad... No. All quotations are good, only people are bad. In an age of revolutions, the only profession is that of a revolutionary. Remember the two basic principles of this society: The commodity and the spectacle. In my profession, it's often necessary to disguise oneself. - You must leave. - Arthur asked me to keep you company. I must go now. Listen, I have to stay here tonight. Can you meet me tomorrow afternoon? Around 4 o'clock? Sure, I'm all right. Okay then. So long. - Have there been any calls for me? - No. I've received a very alarming message. The police are after me. The phone is being tapped There's only one way to deal with the problem. What's the problem? I've told you everything. No that's just it. You never tell me anything. You must quit that job. - Give me... - Or I'll break up with you. Give me some more time. I can't. If I must choose between you and them, I'll choose you, of course. - I don't believe you. - Just give me five days more. - I promise. - I don't believe you. I don't believe you. How can one believe anything as long as something else is going on at the same time? It's never because of any reason given that one person believes anything. It's only the strong getting their way with people who don't know how to defend themselves. I think the time is ripe for action. May I not be lacking in courage. Above all, no sentimentality, That, I've learned. Tomas to Bauer... I hear everything you say, but it doesn't matter. I know how to be stronger than you. You aren't going to kill Francesca and you aren't dying yourself. I know how to be stronger than you. You aren't going to kill Francesca and you aren't dying yourself. I know how to be stronger than you. One must: 1) have courage. 2) be patient, 3) be clear. All my understanding is inside. All my understanding is inside. And how is the work going? It's almost done. Another five days. I think. Then it's time for us To talk about the future. You've become invaluable to me, Tomas. Both my wife and I have grown fond of you. Despite our little differences from time to time. I can find more work for you to do. I want you to stay on with us. I have no desire to continue working for you. How can you say that? Do you realize the importance of the work I do? Don't you realize what an honor it is for you to assist me? Cigarette? Don't you want to do something useful? Instead of being a perpetual student going to demonstrations or, like your girlfriend, peddling pamphlets exhorting people to support noble aims they have no idea how to carry out. I'm giving you a chance to do something. - It's out of the question. - And the confidence I placed in you? I wouldn't trust anyone else as I have you. Your trust is entirely mistaken. You have no reason to trust me. I'll continue to trust you, anyway. I understand human nature. I might add, it's very useful for my work. - I don't err in my judgment of people. - Well, you're wrong about me. - I'll make you believe that. - Are you threatening me with violence? - Looking for one like this? - Where did you get that? From the same person you got yours. She worries about both of us. She wants us both to be safe. Good. Then I can put mine away. Now we can talk reasonably. I just want you to consider your decision. But don't make up your mind right now. I got next Sunday off. I sent Ingrid a note, suggesting we go boating. - I have to pull in! - Tomas! They were quarreling again. - One more word, and I'll kill you! - But she hadn't said a word. What are you doing up at this hour? Anything wrong? Don't you feel well? I think you've alarmed my wife. You see how much she cares about you. We can't leave him in there all night. It's all right. You don't understand. Go to sleep. Unlock the door. It isn't necessary. He has a key himself. - I don't believe you. - Then ask him yourself. Bauer! If you can, come out. Now! - I must go out, darling. - At this hour? It's cold outside. Can't it wait until morning? I'm afraid not. You know how emergencies come up in political work. We who fight for embattled causes must sacrifice personal conveniences. It's kind of you to see me at this hour. I've been trying to see you for weeks, and suddenly you turn up without notice. It isn't that I didn't want to see you. But the way it is in my house... ...I couldn't find the opportunity until now. - You see, I'm watched. - By your wife? Hasn't your wife someone else on her mind now? Would you mind if I took off my jacket? I'm a little warm. - Shall I open a window? - No, I'm okay. I feel better now. - But aren't you ill? - I couldn't be healthier. Touch wood. Did Tomas tell you that? It must be a story of Francesca. I shudder to think of the tales she's told him. You know why I wanted to see you? Because I consider you my enemy. Because of what's happened to Tomas since he began working for you. - You think I have influence over him? - More than that. I don't know what's going on, but... I warn you, I will fight for him. My dear Ingrid, I wish it were true. But I've no influence over him at all. And your wife? Tell me the truth. That's another story. A familiar one, isn't it? An aging man with a beautiful wife has to expect these situations and meet them with resignation. Forgive me. You must be thinking of Tomas. Yes, I was. But I was also looking at you. But your wife and Tomas... At the moment, I can do nothing. But perhaps if you and I were to join forces. To do what? Bauer was reminiscing about his political career... - Perhaps I was more idealistic then... - You mean more revolutionary? The revolution isn't coming soon. - When is the time for the revolution? - Either too early or too late. Then that's the right time. There's something wrong with the food. It tastes all right to me. Take this away! And pack your things! We won't need you any more. We don't need you any more! I think the food is poisoned. Ingrid? What? Nothing... Don't drink any more. You know it makes you sick. Thanks. - I propose a toast to our guest. - Excellent idea. To the lovely Ingrid. I think you've had enough, my boy. You need to have a clear head tomorrow. Shall we go into the living room? Tomas, I want you to do something for me. ...then drive the old woman into town. I want her out of this house. Francesca! Come here. Good morning. Did you sleep well? About our conversation last week. I want to know what you've decided. You will stay on, won't you? I mean, after the work is done? Don't you want to stay? Look at me! Tell me the truth! WHAT COULD MAKE ME WANT TO STAY? A GUN A WOMAN A CAUSE THE WISH TO DESTROY ME THE WISH TO DESTROY YOURSELF - Where is Ingrid? - That's right. Talk to her first. What the hell are you doing? Who's that for? - Francesca woke up with a headache. - No wonder. So did I. And so should you... Stop it! Don't tell me what to do. If you want to talk to me, you'll have to wait. Or can't you bear it that I've taken the same freedom as you? Is that what you wanted to say? Bauer had the nerve to ask me to stay and work for him. And there's something in me that wants to say yes... That's what I wanted to tell you. Not about last night. Let's take a walk. Help me to think. I can't leave here unless you remind me why I must. Tell me why to say no. But I don't see why you should go. There's no reason. It's valuable work. The Bauers treat you as one of the family. The pay is good. So why don't you stay? If the reason is me.... My objecting to your being away too much... - ...there's no problem. - What do you mean? Francesca asked me this morning to stay on. Help her run the household, accompany her on her trips to Italy. It would be only a part-time job. - And you said...? - Not a definite yes. - I had to discuss it with you first. - Which you are doing now. Yes. You're telling me you want to stay. Right? Here, with the Bauers. Are you saying that? Not exactly. Yes. I am willing to stay on. If you are. And that's your advice to me, too? You haven't taken much advice from me yet. You do what you want anyway. Now listen, I'm going to do one of three things: I'll beat the hell out of you, walk out with you, or leave here alone. You can choose. Which is it to be? Francesca's breakfast is getting cold. If you pick up that tray and... Ingrid! I'm hungry! - Wait. I'll be right down. - Ingrid! I couldn't go back to Ingrid's place. I felt absolutely numb. And tired enough to sleep for a year. But I only slept the first two days. - Not enough salt, Ingrid dear. - You must be patient with Ingrid. For being inexperienced she's done remarkably well. We're lucky to have her in this emergency. Ingrid knows how grateful we are, don't you? - Did you eat, Cara? - no. You look pale. You must sit down with us. Right, Arthur? I had no idea you were hungry. What is this levity at my table? I won't have it. Come. Do you like it? Yes. - I'll speak Italian with you. - Sure. Hair. Eyes. You have a beautiful nose. Mouth. - What's the word for this? - Body... And soul. Corpo e anima. - Do you have a wig? - No. - You like it? - No! Try this one. - Now I look like you. - It suits you better. - Wait. - What? I've got something for you. Try it on. There are no buttons. - Do you have enough light, darling? - One moment. Dr Bauer are you open to proposals of ransom or hostage exchange? I have an offer to make: I return to your household if you let Ingrid go. I'm of more use than she. The deal depends on her remaining ignorant of the arrangement. No! Don't send me away! What have I done? Though the Bauers accepted my offer I delayed going through with my part of the bargain. From Bauer. Telling me I'm impatiently expected. Where is Ingrid? What are you doing here? You've changed your hair. You're going back, aren't you? And you can't tell me why? Who's he? Aren't you taking your books? I loved you, you know. - And you don't anymore? - No. But I love you. I'm sure I do. Get out! - What's wrong? - I can't let you in. - Even though I'm quite tolerant. - What the hell...? Francesca is not as tolerant as I am. My wife doesn't want to see you again. Let me talk to her. No. She refuses to see you. She's very ill. You're lying! You're hiding something from me! You've killed her! - Do you need me to help you? - No. That'll be all. I know you don't understand but you must believe one thing. I loved her. I loved her with all my heart. And that's why you killed her? If you must know... She killed herself. She'd been ill too long. She couldn't bear it anymore. You killed her. Why don't you tell the truth? - Let me show you the suicide note. - You could have made her write it. - You think I had such power over her? - Didn't you? All right, I killed her. But I did love her! Nothing you could say or do could make me believe that. - Nothing? - Don't do that! Tomas! He wanted so much to die. But he didn't know how. Is it really so hard to die? So complicated? Yes, it is. Unless it is very easy. But you were helping him. Wait. Where is he? I think the time is ripe for action. May I not be lacking in courage. Above all. no sentimentality. That, I've learned. Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me! Let's go.
