RUDOLF NUREYEV AT LA SCALA He could be very sweet, but also grumpy to the point of being offensive. He laughed and was mean, with his eyes, not with his mouth. He was very expressive. He was authentic yet strange. He had the merits of beasts and the defects of men or vice versa. Eccentric, extravagant, aggressive, at times even offensive, and often rather rude. At times he even threw chairs. Like a character of commedia dell'arte. He had an amazing physique: Compact and proportionate. He had no problem harmonizing, he was born harmonious. He'd built his muscles in line with the harmony of elongation, width, perfect chest, squared shoulders, and arms and legs of the proper length. This allowed him to face all difficulties with extraordinary ease. Even as the years passed and things worsened, his physical characteristics saved him from accidents, difficulties, and failures. They called him "The Flying Tartar". He demanded the impossible of himself and of his body, which wasn't ideal for dance. He had to work extremely hard. Inimitable. He always had problems with his muscles, even his masseuse from St. Petersburg said so. As the years went by, the difficulties increased. He had an exceptional gift but only for certain things, he had to work hard, he worked twice as hard as we did. He was a model for us young dancers. Many time I went into the room when there was no class, when nobody was there, but Rudolf would be there studying. He practiced steps and would study himself... oftentimes without music. The prince of dance. In each of his shows, there were 20 unrepeatable minutes that nobody else could perform. In these 20 minutes, Rudolf seized the essence of the character, and everything else faded into the background. I saw him dance in his last years and noticed his incredible physicality and strength. He would get off the plane and do barre exercises, whereas we would go rest. Where he practiced at the barre, there was a pool of his sweat. I recall his endless barre exercises before shows, on a dark stage. Nobody was in the theater, but Rudy. Nureyev wasn't the man who changed the fate of ballet, conducting the male ballerina into a position of privilege compared to the prima ballerina, who, especially in the late 19th century, was considered a lady's escort. There's a before and after Nureyev, he's a key moment for male ballet. He was not forgotten, we still speak of his contributions to dance as director, choreographer, and maestro. Thus, he revolutionized dance. He conferred upon the male figure relevance equal to the female figure. It's amazing to watch him even when he was just a partner, because in that secondary role, he was able to emphasize his partner's every position. This remains an example. His dance revolved around the male ballerina. He was able to raise the value of the male figure and create a character equal to the female figure, which used to be prevalent in ballet. Think about "Swan Lake", or "Sleeping Beauty", all the classic ballets revisited by Nureyev, he included difficulties, variations, male solos, which are extremely arduous, but which give the male role a weight different than before. He brought modernity to the role of the prince. But it was mainly Bejart who revolutionized male ballet. It was Serge Lifar, from the 1930's Russian school of ballet in Paris, who gave new life to the concept of the male protagonist. Through his own experiences, he realized it was no longer possible to perform romantic ballets much less modern ballets, based solely upon the woman, whose steps were less impressive, whose abilities incited less enthusiasm. He was more of a revolutionist in his life than he was on stage. But he brought a sense of modernity to the dance of life or the life of dance. Milan had always tended toward opera more than ballet before the discovery of Nureyev. He was defined the Callas of ballet. Without Nureyev, ballet in Italy would not have had the fortune that it did. He brought back to the stage that charismatic presence of people who are born to do what others cannot. He could easily stroll around without being bothered. Callas couldn't do that. He improved classic ballet and La Scala. He encouraged the directors to give prominence to ballet, which was rather difficult, since La Scala is opera. Nureyev, with his professionalism and his talent, won over the theater's directors, gaining respect and demanding productions which La Scala also had to invest in. He often worked at La Scala and knew all the dancers, he'd given each a nickname. His behavior changed according to who he was with. Perhaps for him it was like this everywhere, but at La Scala it was like a family reunion. With him, we didn't feel like employed dancers. He made us feel less employed and more dancers. He shook up the world of dance, inside and outside. It was he who decided that at the end of the show the lights should not be turned on immediately, the theater should remain dark. Before, at the end of a show, people would get up and rush out to go back home. But this way, people had to stay and applaud. People waited in line to see him, saying: "The great Nureyev is here". Even a huge star like our Fracci felt intimidated. Since Fracci was always at La Scala, people came especially to see him. Due to the crowds, it was impossible to exit Via Filodrammatici. After having enjoyed him on stage, people gathered around the artists' entrance to see him up close and touch him. There was an immense interest to see him at the theater. I never had the impression that when Nureyev danced, there were two teams, as there were when Callas sang. Nureyev created this craze, he created ballet fans. Milan adored Rudy, it worshipped and loved him with all its heart. Each time, Milan eagerly awaited for him to come back, and Rudy returned Milan's affection. I'm very happy and moved by the reaction of the Italian audience. Did you expect such a crowd in Milan where you hadn't performed it in two years? Yes. When I performed Romeo and Juliet here, every night was sold out. What are your future plans? I'm on vacation as of tomorrow, days of vacation, finally! HOMETOWN FILMED BY NUREYEV - I thought he was born on a horse. - In Vladivostok. You said: "Weren't you born on a horse?" He said: "No, on a train". His father was rather special, he was soldierly, a burly man. He wished for his son to become strong and courageous, capable of hunting at night and doing masculine, virile things. This was the first of the conflicts that sprung up in the family between a soldierly father and a son with a bent for poetry, music, and dance. I was listening radio music. When a member of the government died, they would play music by Schubert, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, the Schumann trio and such. I would cry in front of the radio, not for Kalinin or Stalin's death, but because the music was beautiful. Nureyev decided to never return to his homeland in the early 60s, when the Berlin Wall was built. It was a daring escape, premeditated for years. Paris was not the chosen city for his escape, but London was. Having to flee his country must have been humiliating and unbearably painful for him. If he was encouraged, he found the courage to go on. He arrived in the West at the right time, when the doors were opened for modern dance and America by festivals in Nervi and Spoleto. The strength of Russian companies became recognized, Bolshoi, Kirov... Bejart and the "Ballet du XX siecle", the era of Cranko was beginning, the era of Killian in Holland. Without him we would have had to wait a long time before witnessing this incredible blossoming. Margot Fonteyn was a mother to him, a teacher, a big sister, she taught him manners and speech. She was everything he never had. She was almost 20 years older, with grandiose life experiences, he had fewer, but they were dazzling. She was planning on leaving the stage and found a younger brother in him, a boy to teach. She welcomed him, and chose him as her partner at a mature age, he gave her boundless vitality. She was always very grateful, but he was also grateful to her, because she was a role model which lead him toward the rigor, beauty, and harmony, that this ballerina had. Russian technique, the manner in which Russians danced, bothered him immensely. When we did "Swan Lake", he said to me: "Don't lift your leg up high like the Russians do, but pay attention to your line." Lines were part of Fonteyn's teachings, elongation and length and continuing the port de bras all the way backstage, not interrupting the line during the movement. He considered it a mistake to raise your legs too high. The physique, the column, the poise of the head were ruined by this. Practically, he repudiated his world. It was Erik Bruhn, a refined Danish dancer, who started Rudolf off and taught him how to dance and interpret ballet. Theirs was a great friendship, not long, but intense, not only of an artistic nature. When he got here, his style wasn't very clean, there were many defects. But he'd worked long and hard with Erik Bruhn. He became a bit maniacal after, because even at 45 years old at the barre, he did a perfect fifth. He was mindful of crosses, whereas in Leningrad they weren't as attentive. We also worked with Erik Bruhn, perhaps my favorite partner. With Erik, we immediately had... clarity, we understood each other without speaking. Instead, with Rudy, it was a bit more forced, because there were cultural differences, we spoke different languages. It took a while to understand each other, to get on and create together. I felt he was happy when he spoke Russian. In fact, we often spoke Russian. He'd say: "I understand and speak Italian well, so let's speak Italian or English." He refused to speak Russian. He spoke Russian with me. He and I spoke Russian. I met him and we spoke in Russian. He didn't want to speak Russian, he wasn't repudiating his origins, he just preferred to speak English. Ballerinas who danced with him became better, not just in that moment, but even after, because they felt the tremor, they felt they couldn't fail. I witnessed rehearsals where he decorticated ballerinas and reconstructed them. It was magical. At La Scala he would drag the ballerinas, he actually dragged them. No one else had this magical power to drag them like a magic flute. He was the perfect partner for me, I have no criticisms, even if some ballerinas said he treated them badly. I never had any problems. I was shaking everyone's hand, I gave my hand to Nureyev and out of rage because Fracci wasn't ready, he bit it. I saw him make great ballerinas cry, but the end result wasn't the usual good performance, it was exceptional. He managed to bring out the best in people. He never cared for Vera Colombo, to be honest, he was horribly spiteful with her, she didn't deserve it. He and Vera... There was something that just didn't work for either of them. I believe that in some sense, there's always a bit of sadism in dealing with choreography. The same holds true for the men, he was very harsh with himself also, he wouldn't skip a step. But he was especially harsh with the women. I truly enjoyed him as a partner. He was a splendid partner when he wanted to be. But he could not stand diva-like behavior in his female partners, or false technique. Since he was such a perfectionist, he would not accept that someone might not grasp the message he wanted to transmit. With a character like his, it was normal for him to have such firm reactions. I agree because it's a very strenuous art, we cannot allow ourselves to just let time pass. There are always difficulties, things are never easy, one must study. It was not just about his figure as a great male ballerina. Apparently though, because it wasn't really that way. He desired, deeply and sincerely, for his partner to truly be a part of him. He desired a complete relation with the ballerina. He demanded much more than what a partner could give. But I am grateful to him for everything that he brought to the world of dance and left for young dancers. He expected his partners to look into his eyes, he wanted to be looked in the eyes. He detested ballerinas who avoided his eyes, which were rather magnetic. One of his favorites was Vera, because she looked him in the eyes. He gave me the most beautiful amorous glance that I've ever seen. After Romeo and Juliet when the curtains closed, Carla cried almost every time, because unfortunately, during the performance there had been instigations. We can say it was a fight, almost hidden, a battle of nerves. They hated each other, and loved each other, like all great artists. Rudy and Carla had a love-hate relationship. First of all, they were both Leo, their performance seemed like an arena battle. Rudy clearly felt the weight of being Carla Fracci's partner and Fracci felt the weight of being Rudolf Nureyev's partner. Carla was important to him because in some ways she reminded him of the very special relationship he had with Margot Fonteyn. When they began dancing together, Rudolf found in that younger girl, a sort of continuation, a legacy, of what he had with Margot Fonteyn. Rudy had two role models, very different from each other: One was Fred Astaire, an elegant, modern dancer who hailed from a great classical Viennese school. The other was the savage, the strong man, the provoker, the revolutionary, obviously, Vaslav Nijinsky. The man who had tried, in the first years of Russian ballet, after Fokin, to revolutionize ballet technique. He was the first to take off those leggings that covered certain parts of the male ballerina's body and reveal them in a leotard. With that amazing body, his buttocks were like sculptures, like marble, they didn't seem real. He was still the same Rudy, he wasn't Balanchine's dancer, he was still himself, even in interpreting these modern ballets, even with Bejart. He was always himself, he didn't seem like a modern dancer. He never caused a scene with me. It's odd, he was always very friendly and respectful. When I'd demonstrate a step, he never discussed, he just did it, even if it didn't suit him. But we rarely fought, the few times we did, he was always humorous and ironic which allowed things to smooth out easily. They didn't like each other, there was a total lack of understanding. Bejart wants 100% of his dancers. Rudolf never gave 100% of himself to the owners of ballet. He never wanted to work with Balanchine or Bejart, or any other big name. Deep down, he was an anarchist, an absolute host. During the period of Bejart, he gave an amazing example of that what can be done without doing anything. At the end of "Songs of a Wayfarer" by Mahler, when the two men separate, as he's being lead out, he glances up to the stalls one last time, during that handful of seconds of farewell, he gave the most intense expression that could have been given, that could be given and has been given, to an attentive audience. I recall on the central stage, I had the fortune of witnessing the opening night of "Songs of a Wayfarer". That was an unrepeatable... moment. Because there was Rudolf, Paolo, another great male ballerina, who I was lucky to have as a partner. What can I say? They were two characters who left a real mark... a mark in my heart. It's difficult. I don't mean to say something malicious or serious, he was able to develop tradition when he did La Bayadere, he choreographed it taking his cue from Russian tradition and Marius Petipa, he developed and modernized it, he transformed it, but used the existing base. Thus Nureyev, as a choreographer, incorporated his Russian heritage, transforming it for the 20th century. He had received this heritage. He left an indelible mark for example, on the "Nutcracker", he renewed Don Quixote, shows which were previously unknown in the West. As for Giselle, I don't think he renewed it much, because the things he did had already been done by Lifar. He modernized academic dance. With choreography, he left traces of his behavior and style: Not leaving arms and hands open, he never wanted thumbs to show, he liked positions that were refined, closed, tight, and above all, clean. His best choreography was perhaps "Cinderella", which was completely different from the classic "Cinderella". Lights, costumes, extras... I will battle 100 people tomorrow. There'll be an orchestra too, they all have different tempos, all the ballerinas are upset. If someone didn't fully follow his choreography, there was trouble, because he did not joke around. He didn't even joke around when it came to himself, let alone with others. If a ballerina was having problems and kindly asked if she could change or simplify a step, a pirouette or manege, or any technical element, he absolutely would not change it. Even if you fell down, he would not change his steps. If they made mistakes, they would eventually be thrown out even during a scene. He would change his mind only after an error. "No, this way, I do it this way". After making a mistake for a month, then he'd admit it. He was extraordinarily serious, severe, and demanding with himself. On stage, he did not tolerate errors, not even his own. In this sense, his physical and mental discipline even lead him to cruel acts toward ballerinas who were incapable or unprepared for jumping into his arms during some difficult ballet passages. Two pirouettes, there had to be two pirouettes in every show. In the pas de deux of "Sleeping Beauty", perhaps I spun myself too hard and I was doing a third pirouette. He let me do two and a half then stopped me, and did not let me finish the third. He said "two", so it had to be two. He never changed a step. He always took risks going on stage, he never went on stage saying: "Tonight I don't feel well, I'll take out the virtuosities and some steps." His last years weren't exactly excellent in terms of interpretation. He went on stage anyway, giving the interpretation all his strength, but bit by bit, things would unravel, they didn't function as they used to. He was a courageous man of great moral and physical strength. When he found out about his illness, it was 1982, he realized what his destiny would be and did everything he could to ward off the illness, fighting it day in and day out. He paid heavily for it, he had a personal doctor with him always, who treated him, he practically kept him alive and allowed him to work hard, to be the artist he wanted to be on stage. He lived 10 years of life fearing death, obviously, years spent amidst nightmares and hopes, hopes for a miracle cure, fear of not living to see the next day. 10 years is a lot for an artist like that. Many died after three months. When I took off his shirt, I realized it was stuffed, underneath, he was thin, just skin and bones. Then I realized that the rumors about his illness could really be true. A serious issue is that for the longest time he did not accept the martyrdom of the illness, but he propagated it. When I called him and said: "It's Ettore, remember me?" "Can we meet? I know you're sick but you'll get better". He said: "Come over". I met him in a hospital in Paris, in the outskirts, it was a lugubrious day. He was already delirious, watching TV movies. He didn't like them at all, but still watched them. I held his hand. I said: "I must return to Milan for the opening at La Scala". He: "I'll come too, book me". At one point I said: "My wife saw you dance at Covent Garden and said to wish you a quick recovery." She recalls the performance you gave when she was young." He asked for my wife's name and wrote on a card: "I love you. Rudy". Naturally, we framed it. It was the last thing he wrote. He was a great talent scout, and he spotted them by virtue of his intuitive nature. He could immediately judge a person's qualities. Oftentimes, he clashed severely with the theaters he worked with, from the Paris Opera to the Vienna Opera even La Scala. He was everything for me, he helped me and wanted me in his ballets because he adored me. He helped all young dancers, he had a lovely gift. I met him when he came to La Scala for the last time. I was in dance school, in my fifth year. He was restaging "The Nutcracker" and I recall meeting him in the room after the ballet troupe rehearsal I participated in even though I was a student. He came in while I was there and asked me to show him what I could do. I did some barre work, I was very excited and fast. He corrected me afterward, told me to do it again calmly, following his corrections. I couldn't believe that was happening to me. He told me to leave after class was over, the next day he asked me to give my info to his assistants, they contacted me for the role of Tadzio in "Death in Venice". It was incredibly exciting for me, especially because it was unexpected, and Nureyev is my biggest dance hero, he's always been the best. Being chosen to dance with him was more than a dream. I met Nureyev in a rather casual way at Hotel Continental where I would always go to dine. He was at the peak of his radiance, the height of his glory and technical ability. At one point, some of his admirers showed up that he wanted to run away, and in fact he ran away. To reach the elevator, he had to cross the room, and the way he crossed that room... He moved with such grace, it seemed like his feet flew off the floor. While performing this improv ballet, he would glance back at me with complicity, he was a real son of a bitch. He knew music, he played the piano rather well. That's no surprise, because especially in Russia, and in countries where dance is studied seriously, knowing music isn't just necessary, it's fundamental. He liked cinema, especially action films, American films. He read various kinds of books. He loved paintings, 19th century paintings, we could say lofty paintings, boulevard style. You had a huge international star near you, yet at times he was very... He was very human and simple. Very open to jokes and irony. It was a beautiful relationship... Even food thrilled him. He loved meat stew with various sauces, and pasta. My mother, who he called "mom", prepared this meat stew for him, he loved tongue and calf's head. She made it specifically for him, since we didn't like it. She made pasta sauces for him, which thrilled him. He'd say: "I'll just stop by". He'd arrive at 9:00, saying he had to leave at 11:00, but at 3:00 he was still there chatting and relaxing. It was nice for him and us. One night he invited me to a dinner... He had been invited and was inviting others along. I made the mistake of saying he missed out on the borsch I made. I said: "I made a batch of borsch, but you're leaving, so none for you". I should've never said it! He forced me to go home and bring the borsch along to this dinner party. We warmed up the borsch and even the guests ate it and enjoyed it. Before serving the borsch, he took half of it for himself. He was very spoiled. It bothered him when they gave him soup in a Thermos, first he was glad, then turned around and said: "Geez!", Nothing was good enough for him. It was the care of people who followed him in admiration, with love and respect. Ready to welcome people he considered sincere. This is the image I have of Rudolf. He was a bit older than me, but I always felt maternal toward him, I always felt I had to protect him. In reality, he could protect himself just fine, but sometimes I sensed he needed a mother. There were two aspects of him: The incomparable male ballerina of Nijinsky, and the man who had secret emotions and tribulations to live with day by day. I said to him: "How's your life?" "On your day off, for example, you fly to New York, you never rest, you're never serene". He said: "You have a family, a son, I have no one, I'll die on stage". But he wasn't alone, it was just his way of being, he wanted to be alone. He had many friends, lovers, people around him, but at one point he felt a bit oppressed, he wanted freedom. He was a solitary person, he suffered from loneliness. I was a friend to him, we spent time together, but he longed for moments of solitude. At times he'd disappear, he felt the need to reclaim his privacy. When he was alone with people he considered friends, he became somewhat of a child, he liked to play and joke around. He always wanted to win. If someone said "I beat you", he'd deny it, even if it was true. This was the infantile side of Rudolf. All of us ballerinas have an infantile side, because we began working seriously at a young age, thus, we missed out on that part of life: Growing up, and playing with schoolmates, neighborhood friends. We all missed out on this. I recall he was as happy as a child, he had eyes like a child. I recall going to the home of highsociety people in Milan, they had curio cases filled with rare collectibles, he said to me: "Ask her if she'll give one to me". Like a child who wants a toy. At times he behaved like a bratty child, who wanted something he liked. He'd go into a store and buy a rug, then wear it out on his shoulders to see if it looked good on him. A bit crazy. Some say Nureyev was stingy, but he was actually wealthy and stingy. Perhaps that's a sign of the precariousness ballerinas feel during the course of their lives, that theaters will shut you out and you'll end up poor. Rudy wasn't stingy, but like all people who had suffered hunger, he was cautious, not out of stinginess, but out of fear of poverty. He liked going out at night to parties and dinners. He liked to wander around dangerous places, in the slums of the city. He wasn't fond of socalled worldliness, but he was tempted by adventure. We'd go dancing at Parco delle Rose. He loved this place. After four ballet acts, we were exhausted, yet he would dance like crazy. He would rid himself of the weight of classical dance. What was striking about Rudolf was his love for life, pleasure, and work well done. Maybe this is why he burnt out so young, because he lived life and work intensely. He would go to bed at 5:00 or 6:00 AM then get up for class at 9:00 and work intensely. It was a life full of pleasure and hard work, rigor, effort, and honesty. He was an honest worker. Nureyev was jealous of his private life, he never allowed anyone to speak or gossip about him unless he authorized it. As for me, I believe I found out something but I will never reveal it. A man who was fucked by life in every sense. Exile was devastating for him, more than he ever admitted. When he was able to visit his mother and sister... He carried a large wound inside. He was homesick for Russia, he would never have gone back, but wanted to. I went to Russia around 1965 until 1989, for tours, especially in the 70s. He was erased, you couldn't mention his name. You absolutely couldn't mention it. Some male lead ballerinas asked me about him, but they were totally terrorized. He was erased from all of Leningrad's ballet books. A colleague of mine, Liliana Cosi, went there to deliver letters. In those days, it was not allowed. We brought letters to his mom, he cared greatly for her, and to his maestro Pushkin. He remembered all these people. He wanted to leave, because after being here for so long, he felt fulfilled, he'd done what he wanted to. "In my recurring dream my mother appears." "I see a large, tall bread ladder, my mother's at the top holding out her hands to me." He felt nostalgia to return home to his mother, he eventually did, but it was too late, because his mother had died. How do you feel about what's happening in the Soviet Union? The right moment has finally arrived, we've been waiting forever for it. We finally have the possibility to be human. He was given permission to return to his homeland, Corriere della Sera sent me to cover this amazing event. They gave me this wonderful assignment of being able to see him up close. Those were fantastic days because he was serene, because he'd returned to his home to see his old teachers, the places where he was born, to see the Kirov Ballet. He was an entirely different man, he joked around... We went to St. Petersburg to the French Consulate and he began dancing and I danced with him. I said: "Rudolf, you're not a good dancer". He joked around a lot, it was wonderful. - You look wonderful! - Really? I'm already 100 years old. I envy you. I'd like to live until 100 too. I'm so happy to see you. I had to wait 100 years to see you again. - You dance so well. - Come see me. He was applauded, I was on stage with his old teacher, who had a bouquet of white carnations and was crying. She said: "We knew right away he had extraordinary talent". - Yes, I dance. - I don't have your biography. - You should... - I've just begun writing it. I have something important to say... All of my pupils send me theirs. - I'll write another one. - No, I want the old one! I only recall the great enthusiasm of his colleagues and teachers who started crying when he arrived. It was such a moving moment... I felt emotional for myself. The warmth with which he was received says it all, they had never forgotten him, he was their hero. Nureyev missed it all, but never said anything, the strong emotions of returning home after exile. He felt he could dance in his homeland. His nature changed. He was with his people again who said to him: "We're happy you've returned". When he got back I asked him how it went, and he said it was extremely exciting. Then I asked about his mother, and he said: "Mother is very ill, she didn't even understand I was there". And I said: "Are you kidding?" "Even a dead mother recognizes her son." "The fact that you went there, kissed her, held her hand, she felt you and understood you were there". He looked at me as if he'd seen a whole new world and said: "Really?" The decision to become an orchestra director wasn't sudden. I've had it in mind for many years, I was waiting for the occasion. There's a professor in Vienna who was convinced I should've become an orchestra director even 10 years ago. He finally called me last year about the possibility of doing rehearsals with the orchestra. I went immediately, I tried it and this show is the result. He was my partner, choreographer, friend, and orchestra director. The wonderful thing that comes to mind is when he directed "Sleeping Beauty" in America. I sensed his immense happiness. He lived his whole life on stage, then he moved to the other side. He seized the opportunity to be together with us. He was music and dance at the same time. I'm afraid of only one thing, dying without having tried every possible thing. He was a homosexual legend. An amazing talent, an egocentric man, even rough, but so gifted that he could do anything. At times, it was hard to speak to him because you felt he exuded a sense of absolute superiority. He was gifted, there's nothing we average mortals can do. It's the difference between a genius and a professional. Nureyev's genius isn't learned, he was born with it. He was always kind to us kids, he was playful, he fascinated us. We considered it the arrival of a legend, from whom we'd absorb everything he taught and said. A teacher like Rudolf Nureyev... I hope there will be another, but I highly doubt it, because he was an exceptional man. There are many good ballerinas who do sensational things, but after watching them for 5 minutes, you understand, this did not happen with Nureyev. You were transported, body, soul, and mind, it was impossible to be distracted. Something like this cannot be taught, he was born like this. I've read lots of Shakespeare, I studied the critics, from the early 18th century up until present day. I studied other versions and I saw that Shakespeare wrote this tragedy in four days. He conveyed this desperation of a desperate couple rushing toward death. Around him, during those days of agony, some friends, not many, went to visit: An old woman who taught dance, Marika Besobrasova, his sister, some relatives he didn't care to see, some reporters, such as my friend Ettore Mo, another common friend, Lino Bricco, who spoke of having seen a withered body, which had nothing human left to it, unlike the body Nureyev had when he was young, a distraught man until the end of his days, with a small TV in his hospital room, who replied yes or no only with his eyes. Luckily, this is something I did not see. If I had, I would've wanted to forget it. When we went to the funeral, they glared at me because I was the only one who'd been able to see him. There was a sense of hostility. I went to his funeral in Paris, it seemed as if the sky had it in for us. I've never seen the Parisian sky so leaden, so chockfull of rain and humidity, a hideous day. When I learned of his death, I flew to Paris as a small thank you to him. I don't know what to say. It's not easy to describe a man like him. I'll dance forever.
