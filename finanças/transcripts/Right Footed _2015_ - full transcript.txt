Oh, wow. Ha ha! My very first teachers in life were my parents. They were my inspiration growing up, but they made a very important decision when I was born, and they decided that they would raise me like they would raise my brother and my sister. They weren't going to treat me any different. They weren't going to hide me away, and they taught me to be confident about who I am, to embrace my difference and embrace my disability. Thank you. I challenge you to think about something you've always wanted to do, but even more importantly, what is it that's stopping you? Actually, I remember it was right about here that the fourth-grade class was all lined up and we were walking along here, and then a fifth-grader was behind me. He had a big tee shirt on. He had his arms in his shirt, and he came up to me, and he was all like, "Look, Jessica. Look, Jessica. I'm just like you. I'm handicap." It was like a moment when he was saying that I was handicap and that I wasn't-- that I couldn't do anything or that I wasn't enough. When I was born, my mom was just devastated. You envision your child to be perfect-- you know, 10 fingers, 10 toes. She didn't know, what kind of life would I lead? Oh, I was depressed. I don't want visitors. I closed the curtain, and I said, "No. Let me be by myself to think over what did I do wrong." The feeling guilty was just all over, you know? - The initial shock of it, naturally, was quite traumatic, but someone came up at the hospital a day or two after she was born and said, "You know, God must really have thought you two, "you and your wife, are strong parents because He allowed y'all to have a child like this," and that kind of touched my heart a little bit. I got thinking, well, maybe that's the way I should look at it anyway. Everyone had something I didn't have, and I was different, and I knew that people reacted to me different, but the only way that I could express that was through anger and frustration. I threw fits. My sister will tell you, my brother will tell you I was horribly selfish. - I was kind of expected to help her and do different things that I don't think a typical younger sister would do. It was hard on all of us. - My mom poured her soul into Jessica, into raising Jessica... you know, at cost-- to herself, to her other children. My mom was resigned to the fact that she was going to take care of me for the rest of my life. And she made that commitment the day of my birth. My mom is a super-independent woman. She's so strong. She came to this country from the Philippines, and she started a life for herself and became a very successful nurse. Well, I don't even know if she realizes if, but I'm very much like her, and as much as she tried to take care of me, I struck out against that. I remember seeing the slide from right over here. I was prevented from climbing up it many times, and it just infuriated me. It made me upset and angry that they were holding me back. Everyone else could be on the slide, but I could only sit on the swings. In my frustration, I'd just sit here and envision that I could fly over this entire playground and I was Superwoman. I'd take up one of my friends at a time and fly them around, but I was the only one with a super power, so I was the hero. Sometimes she gets it, and sometimes she doesn't. I got my first prosthetic arm when I was 3 years old. People called me things like "Hook" or "Robot Girl." I didn't know why God created me this way. She has no friends, and kids, they talk about her--behind. 6 years old, I put her in the dance. I want to expose her with the other children. I remember my teacher announcing that we were going to be onstage in front of all our family and friends, and I remember how terrified I was. And then came the first round of applause. I danced for 14 years. My mom went to the taekwondo teacher and explained the situation-- that her daughter didn't have arms-- and he said, "Well, that's fine, as long as she has a good attitude." I went through the ranks, and at the age of 14, received my first-degree black belt. First day of eighth grade, I was faced with this question-- do I wear the fake arms to school? And I go like this, and that one... And of course, I'd have to come over here and fasten this in place, which I'm not going to do right now because I don't even know if they fit me anymore. I understand where people were concerned, and I'm going to take them off now because they just are so uncomfortable. That was like a jail cell or something. It was very tough to have to deal with creating an identity as a child when I had to wear something that was keeping me from being who I was, who I am, and I walked to the bus stop without them, and I promised myself I would never wear these again. I think people on the outside saw that I was a perfectly fine, competent student, but internally, I was going through this challenge or this struggle of acceptance. I was so self-conscious about what people thought about me, and just the thought of being different and eating with my feet, so I'd refrain from eating. She didn't date or anything like that. Yeah, I would hear about her crushes, but she was probably was just a little bit too insecure with herself. I remember seeing a TV piece about a woman. Her name was Barbara Guerra, and she was a young mom. She goes over, and she picks this little baby up. She was changing the baby's diaper. And I went over to her house, and after that, I was a different person. It was almost like an awakening that I had never experienced. It's really incredible how one person can be that difference. When was the last time you said, "I can't"? How many of you said "I can't" today? Oh! And guess what are the two words that I've eliminated from my vocabulary. - I can't. - I can't. Now, are there any questions? Uh-huh. How do you write? I write with my toes, and by the way, I'm right footed. OK. So, give me low 5. We kind of relate because we both kind of have a hard life, because I can't hear. I just want to grow up to be normal. I don't want to be that person that they know that I'm deaf and make fun of me. When I was in seventh grade, I hated being different. I really hated it. I wanted to just blend in. I just wanted to slide under the radar, you know, just not be... stared at or noticed or like, "Oh, look at her," or, you know, whispered about or, like, you know, people saying things. - I felt like I wasn't the only one. You aren't, for sure. I know what it's like to be angry, because I was angry as a child. There are times when I might still have that anger within me and can pull that out, but it's funny because I think that same anger is what gave me some of the drive that I needed. When I graduated the University of Arizona, there was an article done, and I said I wanted to be a motivational speaker, and that's what drew a lot of people. They hired me for a few speeches that summer, and that started it out. Hello. I'm Jessica Cox. I graduated from the University of Arizona just about 3 weeks ago. Somehow, it was therapeutic to be able to stand up in front of 100 people and say, "You know what? I was born without arms," because I'd spent all the years prior to that trying to hide the fact that I didn't have arms. Yah! That was empowering-- to be confident about who I am, as opposed to hide who I am. My biggest obstacle is social acceptance. People don't believe that I can do everything and anything with my feet. It's hard for me to convince people that I can do that. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. I was speaking at a Rotary Club meeting, and a pilot came up, and he asked if I wanted to fly in an airplane. My dad, who's an aviation enthusiast, was standing right beside me. He said, "She would love to." Whenever I went up on a commercial jet, as early as I can remember, I was just terrified, so the thought of being in a single-engine airplane-- that's crazy. - That was all about being a fear that she had, but I think it was the right decision, because flying is an exciting adventure for anyone. The pilot said, "How about trying to put your foot on the yoke?" I slipped my shoe off, I put my right foot up on the yoke, and I was just beaming because here was the ultimate form of independence. I said, "I'd like to be a pilot." Turn the master switch on here. I worried about the flying. I said, "How can you?" If I was going to overcome my greatest fear, which was flying, it was going to be a very emotional challenge for me. - The Ercoupe is unique because unlike every other airplane in the world, you don't have any pedals that you have to use to fly it. I taught somebody that had polio and only had use of one leg. But the thought of teaching someone without arms is much more daunting, and I talked to other flight instructors, and they were less than encouraging. Pull it up real quick so it doesn't dry. I'd experienced a lot of discrimination before, and I knew that that was apt to happen, but we were very conscientious about what we did and made sure that we did everything that was right. I have a very hard head, so... I am going through the cockpit checklist, and then I will go through the takeoff checklist, as well, and I've been doing this every single morning. OK. This is the shoulder straps for the seatbelt. One challenge I had in flight training-- buckling up the 4-point harness. How do you buckle up something around you? Jessica said to me, "Would you mind stepping away from the airplane "and let me work on it and come back in about a half-hour?" I said sure, and I thought to myself, "How is she going to do this?" So it'll be all the way. This was going to be almost impossible. It's not going to work. I actually stood up on the seat, buckled the harness first, loosened the straps, slipped in... And that's it! We didn't have things worked out, and I found out that the throttle was too high up on the control panel for me to safely maneuver this plane, so Glen did not sign me off for soloing. My hope was we would find another Ercoupe that she could solo and ultimately get her license in. I never found an instructor that was willing to do it. I felt like everyone had given up on the possibility of me becoming a pilot. Came to find out about Parrish Traweek in my own back yard, only an hour drive from Tucson, and he had me in his Ercoupe airplane, training, less than 24 hour from meeting him. - I can tell you that nothing was given to Jessica. Nothing was made easier for her, and at times, things were made tougher for her. You're going to round out-- boom, same picture. There was a point where I was scared to land, and he just said, "Jessica, you know you can do it. You know you can do it." We had some pretty heated discussions and knew she could do it, but the landing issue was tough. That was a lot of work. I was prepared to solo, and I invited all my family and friends to the airport. I was distracted. I was paying more attention to the people there. Parrish said, you know, "There's no way I'm going to sign you up to solo right now," and I knew I was disappointing people. The next morning, with only one other student at the airport, Parrish says, "I'll let you solo the airplane." Is it recording? It says it is. Here goes Jessica on her solo flight. Looks good. Parrish said, "Before you go, you have to make sure that you can hear me on the radio," so I tested out the radio. Turned my first crosswind turn, and then I heard static, and I said, "Don't tell me. That's the radio." Can you hear me, Jessica? Hey, Jessica, can you hear me? She's got something wrong with her headset or something. Parrish, I can't really hear you. OK. Just keep flying the airplane. You're OK. Just fly the airplane. I need all traffic... Came in to land, and I was low and slow. She's all right. Stabilize out. Good decision. That was a good move. Can you hear me? Can you take this camera? I'm going to go out there, and hopefully, I'll just get her to full-stop land, because now she's rattled a little. You know what I mean? Yeah. Good landing, Jessica. I came around, and I landed smoothly on the second one. I'm a perfectionist, and I wanted to make sure that that was a very good, smooth landing. That was so awesome! I can't believe I did that. Did I scare you? You know, it wasn't so much that I was proving everyone who doubted me that I could do this, but it was more of a personal achievement. I had overcome my own fear. Anybody that accomplishes a solo, it's a huge deal. I mean, I've had a lot of men cry and stuff, you know? It's a very emotional time. One of the traditions in flying is when you solo for the first time, they cut the tail of your shirt. There's really nothing like that. That was so incredible. It was the most empowering thing I've ever done, for sure. OK. First solo. I'll just put my whole name. That was very good, very good. Thank you. I have to tell you, I prayed a lot to be able to do that, and so, it was almost like seeing a miracle come true, right before my very eyes. I was up high, flying, like Superwoman. - Our next guest is living proof that you can accomplish anything. Please welcome Jessica Cox. - Her name landed in the Guinness world record for being the first woman to fly a plane without arms. - President Obama met with Jessica Cox at the White House and called her an inspiration. - She's being honored at the White House in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Equal access. Not dependence, but independence. That's what the ADA was all about. - The ADA has helped me in ways that I don't even know. - Our young person who arrives this week is Jessica Cox. - Now 25-year-old Jessica Cox is a licensed pilot, which is pretty incredible considering she was born with no arms. - You're currently a motivational speaker. I'm a motivational speaker, but I hope to have a bigger impact and change the perspective of disability. - Last month, Jessica went to Rome, this time to offer Pope Benedict XVI her prized possession. He embraced my face, and I told him, "I'd like you to have this Guinness world record medal," and then I said, "Please pray for my mother, who is sick," and he said, "I will." I'm going to find her. Is my mom around here? Hey, Mom. We first found out about my mom having cancer in 2007. That was right about the time when I was pretty intense with flight training. She was going to have her first surgery to remove a part of her lung. It was a time when I know she really needed my family to be there to support her, and my mom said, "Don't worry about me. "I want you to go out there and, you know, train, like you had planned." And then in 2009, we found out that the cancer had metastasized to her brain. It is my mom's 59th birthday, and this will be the very first time I've ever flown her in the Ercoupe. I could not believe until the day that I rode in the plane with her. I said, "Oh, my gosh, you really can fly." - She wants to go up again. That was too short. I think it brought home the point to treasure her, and every single day, I still remind myself that... that I don't want to take her for granted. The hardest challenge for me growing up was being able to use the restroom and get dressed in the morning without my mom. It took me close to 11 years. One of the therapists at the Shriners Hospital came up with the idea of a windshield repair tool. It was the key to me being able to be an independent person. The most important thing I learned-- if you can be creative enough, you can be persistent, then you can figure it out. Jump to a middle stance. Good. We are going to start off with high blocks. I was teaching a taekwondo class, and in walks this woman, and I remember thinking, who is this person who won't take the time to take her arms out of her jacket and return a hug? I thought it was kind of rude. But not long after, I realized my mistake. Getting to know him, I was like, "This guy, he's pretty cute, and he's sweet." Kick! We both liked each other, and it was obvious. I kind of dropped some hints. So once he was no longer my instructor, that's when we started... working through the... relationship. Oh, Jessica, it's so pretty! Look at the mirror, right here. Wow. Mom has to see this. We try on the veil, too, no? Yeah. We can. Mom, where are you right now? Let me go get it. Did you want to try it? Look at that! - Here. What do you think? And you, Mom-- your face. What do you think? Yeah. Sad. I'm losing my girl. A little girl, OK, a baby, that I used to carry around, and now she's grown up and... And I realize everyone grows up, you know. I used to go with her, trips, like we went to Greece and every other country. Now it's going to be her husband. I'll be missing her, but everyone is entitled to fall in love. I first met her as her taekwondo instructor. It wasn't that, "Oh, look at this really awesome person. "Look at all the stuff she can do. "She can use chopsticks. She can fly an airplane. She can do all this stuff with her feet." It was, "OK. Kick me in the head with your foot as fast as you can before I can block it." It was a unique position that gave me a chance to quickly get over, "Well, she's really awesome." She is. One couple we haven't sent an invitation to... I did tell him, my life before you was a lot about doing things on my own, and it was about proving my independence. I remember one point when it was just like, "Oh, I'm really going to give all this up," and I almost felt like I was going to lose a part of myself, of who I am. - I'm never really catering to your needs of, "Oh, do you need help with this?" I don't let you get lazy. No. That's also true, yeah. You should see mom. She looks great. Really? Yeah. She looks really great. The wig looks like her real hair right now, under that hat. That's crazy. That's really... Mom, you look great! You really do, Mom. My gosh, Mom, 20 years younger. Oh! Really. - Whoo! - Hi, Jessica. Oh, hey! How are you? - Oh, you look so pretty! Oh, thanks. It's good to see you, girl. So, have you girls been to other weddings? I'm sure. - Not like this one. - Really? - Yeah. I know you're going to have your day one of these days, you know? I was in no rush myself, personally. I first met Jessica, and it was pretty amazing. I was like, I didn't know anybody who didn't have arms yet, and then I was all like, "Oh, my gosh! She doesn't have arms, and she's, like, cool." Ha ha! She's just really confident. She's like a role model to me. Have a stab. One of the girls that I was mentoring, Ira, doesn't think any of the guys are going to date her. To see someone who doesn't have any arms get married and find love and find someone who can love in return and see me for me I think will change her in a way that my older mentor changed me. - She seems really laid back. - She said she was nervous, but she was excited, too. She doesn't act nervous, though. She's just like, "OK. I'm having my wedding. This is so cool." This was specifically made by a designer in the Philippines. - Really? Because I said I wanted something that kind of like had this feeling of, you know, whole and complete because a lot of dresses are sleeveless or tube top. Right. That's really cool. Her dress is beautiful. It's like a custom dress. Her dress is so awesome. It has like these bead bling stuff on it. - Did you ever wonder about that-- like what you would do for, like, a wedding ring? What about you, Ira? I don't-- I don't know. - Bye. - Bye. - She looks so pretty. - I know. She looks beautiful. Mr. Groom, up here for me, please. Those are your shoes? Yes. OK. Are you wearing these shoes for the wedding? - Yes. - Really? If my feet are comfortable, I'm happy, and I don't really care that they look different. There is a lot of attention paid to feet in this wedding. Yes. There is a lot of attention paid to that. I'm very happy about the wedding. I didn't have the normal mother/son relationship, but to see Jessica where she is now, it was all worth it, you know? We've no less days To sing God's praise Than when we've first begun All please rise to welcome the bride. It was not the eyes that saw something beautiful in each other. It was their heart, and you saw the most beautiful thing in each other that convinced you that you are meant for one another. Jessica, take this anklet as a sign of my love and fidelity. Patrick, take this ring as a sign of my love and fidelity. It is my joy and honor to introduce and welcome the newly wedded couple, Mr. And Mrs. Patrick Chamberlain. Patrick is kind of like a prince, and Jessica looks pretty tonight, and it's really special. Aww! I would say it was well choreographed, and it was pretty amazing how they, like, did it without, like, tripping on the dress or anything. I've never seen, like, a dance with someone who has no arms, so it was interesting to see how that would go. Yay! There's no frosting on here. Ha ha! Bring that music down a little bit. On the count of 3, are you ready? 1... 2... 3! Oh! Oh, my god! One of the things that I have to live with is that my birth wasn't a happy scene, and that, I think, has given me a great mission to help parents who have children who are born differently, to let them know that they can celebrate and they can have joy for their child. Do your somersaults, girls. - What? - Do a somersault. Be careful. Ready? Go. Ha ha ha ha! Going to our first ultrasound, it was a shock. - When they told us that she didn't have any arms, it was just... it was hard to take at first. I told Greg, "I want you to name her," and I just figured he really needed that. Why he come up with Grace, I don't know, but I think it fits. Yeah. Hi! Open the door. Hello. Hi. I'm Jessica. How are you? I've heard so much about you all. I'm good. How are you? And Greg, right? How are you? Good. And of course, Gracie. Say hi. Told you she was going to come and see you today. First time I think I heard about Jessica Cox, I think I might have been working, and I was on break, and I seen a little clip of her on the TV, on the "Ellen" show. I emailed her. I said it'd be nice to meet you. But I was born without arms, so from very early age... My dad decided that he wouldn't go back to work. He wanted to stay home and help Gracie. Every once in a while, he would cry. He's kind of like that, taking it a little too hard on himself, wishing that he could change it. I see you, Gracie, in the mirror. Oh! Ha ha ha! OK. Are we ready to go? Yeah. Head to preschool. What's your favorite thing to play on? A slide. Me, too! The slide was my favorite. This-- this is mine. Oh, OK. It's funny. I prefer the cups with handles, too. I'm seeing that there's a lot of everything alike that you guys do, and it's just amazing. When I was about your age, I didn't want to trip and fall on the playground, so I had to learn how to tie my laces without any hands, without any arms. How many of you-- just raise your hand-- are learning how to tie your shoelaces? OK. Over and through... So, under there... The first time I did this, this took a long time, but the most important thing is that I practiced. Every day, I practiced, and I said, "I'm never going to give up unless I can tie my shoes." And... Pull to tighten. Being with Gracie, I think my first moment of realizing, wow, she doesn't-- they're not there was when I gave her her bath. I went to go pick her up out of the bathtub, and she just went right through my arms, down into the tub. All I could do was cry. I mean, I just... I was... I was like, "I'm so sorry." So... To get her back into a bathtub after that was some work. - 1, 2, 3, go. You win! You win. I can't swim. You could swim if you practice. Hey, I'll show you how I swim, OK? You can come sit on the stairs first. If you come closer, you can see better. Come sit right there. On the edge. I'm going to doggy paddle first, because that's the first thing to do. Want to come out here, just hold your sister? You'll be OK. No! No! Aah! You don't have to come in. It's OK. You can just watch. I'm going to swim there and back. Is that cool? - It's scary to put your head in the water at first. Take a step. You'll be fine. It's deep. It's not deep, honey. I'll hold you. - No. - No? How about we try sitting? I'll sit beside you, too. Does that work? Want me to try? So we go one step at a time. I'm going to come over there, and I'm going to sit right beside you here, and we're going to go down one at a time... very slowly, and then your sister is there. She can catch you. OK? 1... Go down one more. I'll be right there. See? See? Just go slow. You'll be OK. There! Ready? Kick, kick, kick. Come on. We're almost there. We're almost there. Yay! We made it. Good job. Give me 5. Yeah. Give me 5, too. Oh! It was good! Now let's do it again. You want to do it again? Come on. Keep kicking. We're almost at the back of the pool. Yay! We're on the deep end. Ha ha ha! I remember when a girl looked absolutely terrified, like she was going to lose her job, because she was giving me a rental car. It's really great to kind of, like, mess with people's expectations like that sometimes. Hello. Hi. Long time, no see. Hi. It's been a while. How you doing? You can be nervous. Oh! So you're going to eventually do it without her, though. - Yeah. - OK. Unfortunately, she can't go on stage with me. Yeah. I wasn't sure I really wanted to share with you my perspective of our first couple of meetings because I was like, uh, it's going to sound rude or mean, and I don't want it to come across that way, but there were several things you wanted to learn how to do. One of them was pushing a shopping cart. You thought it was going to be difficult, and it seemed like, "Well, my mom is just going to come and help me shop up at college every weekend." And I thought, man, she's just perfectly content to let her mom do this for her. Am I wasting my time up here, trying to help this girl? So I'm glad to see that... It had a positive influence. That it all paid off. So, do you have any cooking tips, by the way? Well, I know that you said that you do all the cooking. Is that because you just love to cook? I do like to cook. But, you know, doing all of the chopping and everything... You don't do the chopping at all, or anything? I do the dishes. Oh. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. I'm going to have the coconut. She was kind of worried about, you know, because we spent so much of our lives proving that we can be independent, you know, even kind of doing extreme things just to prove people wrong and prove that we can do things, she was kind of worried that getting married was going to take away some of that, but... In our case, it didn't because I learned very soon, very early in our relationship to just help her when she asks for it, because she's so independent. You know, when you get married, yeah, you are dependent on each other, but it's a different type of dependence. Yeah. Patrick and I, we work together as a team, and right now, we are on a speaking tour that started in San Francisco, then flew to Seattle, then flew back to San Francisco, then flew to Kansas City. It's been very challenging for me. I went from, a year ago, working 40 hours a week, and then I got to step away and do my own thing, to now Jessica wakes up in the morning, and before she says hello, she's checking emails on her phone. Looks good. All right. Thank you very much. From how I write to how I eat to how I do everything in my life... Today, one billion people worldwide are considered disabled, and many are kept hidden away, denied an education and other basic human rights. A new United Nations treaty, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, offers some hope. When Ethiopia signed the CRPD, it paved the way for Handicap International to open 6 schools to children with disabilities. We receive emails on a weekly basis, "My life in my country has been so difficult. "I was born with a disability. Can you help me?" And up to this point, Jessica really hasn't known how to make a change. - This is a trip to help children with disabilities. This is something I've never done before, so this is unique in that respect, that I'm not being paid to be there. No one's being paid. We're there to help people and change attitudes. My greatest fear is, what if I can't make a difference? What if things are just going to be the same, and this is pointless, this is a waste of time, energy, and people's support financially? I hope that it shows the world and it shows people in Ethiopia that disability does not mean inability. Handicap International invited Tariku to Addis to meet with me. How are you? It's nice to meet you. I do this thing with my feet when I meet people. Want to do that? One foot? OK. It was very difficult to break down his wall. He has never seen a white person in his life. OK. It's funny because the only time I'm looked at as a white person is if I'm in Africa. Let me put this away. I think it was the first time for him to ride a car, and of course the very first time he'd ever seen an airplane, so all this was coming at him. OK. Bye-bye. See you in the air. I'll be up in the air. OK? I'll wave at you from up there. At 10,500? Yeah. 10,500, 900, a thousand. Feel free. I'll pull us up a little. We just want to say something. Keep pushing for the lives of people with disability, of not physical, but mind. I will need you for that, all right? Yeah. Did you get to see that-- us coming in? Yeah. He's just being a little shy. We've been hearing how children who have disabilities are hidden at home, denied the opportunity to go to school. They're burdens on their families. They end up being embarrassments. I was there hoping to bring inspiration to them and show what's possible. Hello. Should I take my shoes here? Welcome, welcome. Yeah. Can't move on her own. - How many brothers and sisters do you have? Hodan, haltingly: I have 2 sister and 3 brother. That's good. Yeah. Ah, good. That's good English. She wasn't delayed to the extent that I expected to see, hearing that she'd been hidden away. What is your message to Ethiopians, to the rest of the world? That's a very beautiful message. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. She also translates what she said. That's so, so funny. It was really hard to walk away from that situation and say that I was powerless; I couldn't do anything about it. Welcome, welcome. Hello? She's a little bit nervous, yeah? How could I expect someone who's visually impaired to open up to me? I told her to feel me, to touch me, touch my face, my hair, my feet. I see you now very well, she said. She had to feel that I was holding the Popsicle with my right foot. I use my toes. I'm using my feet. And she had to feel my anklet. Yeah! Ha ha ha ha! She said you have to love her very much. Ha ha! Oh, thank you. I do. It was just really hard to hear her story of losing her sight and then having these seizures. It was very hard. For me, sometimes it's difficult to be different because people treat me differently, and sometimes they're scared. Sometimes they don't know what to do. Sometimes it's awkward. I wanted to know what it's like for you sometimes. My mother would do the same thing for me, too. She'd always say, you know, "Don't feel sorry for her," when I was younger. Wow. It's... You're an inspiration to me, too, that you are able to overcome all that you have. Ahh... Ahh. Thank you. Welcome, welcome! Welcome, welcome! Jessica, we love you. We love you. Each of you have something in you that will allow you to push through the most difficult times. She has mental problem. She can't write. She can only draw a circle in her exercise book. Circles on her exercise book. I don't think I need to hear any more, because all I see is a beautiful girl and someone who tries, and that's all that matters. Oftentimes, people told me that I didn't have hope for the future when I was a child. They'd see me walking around. I didn't have arms. I couldn't do anything, and it's not-- I learned that it's not what they say. It's what you do, so don't let anyone discourage you. Look at her. Look at her. Oh... Being with all the girls made me question how much I took for granted. Oh! Disability is also hardship, poverty, and pain, and I heard that in these girls' stories, and I told them, I'm going to hold all of your stories close to heart, and if there's ever a time that I have difficulty in my own life, I will remember you. Oh! Thank you. Really learning things along the way... Jessica was being in front of press and meeting people... I had to be there to help her kind of decompress. Wow. Bye! Ha ha ha! 1, 2, 3. I don't think I could do anything better than just be there for her. I'll introduce you to my husband Patrick. We want to share with you part of our wedding dance. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2... For many people, that was a real surprise, that Jessica could get married. A lot of people got a lot of inspiration about the fact that I was Jessica's husband. It showed everybody the relationship Jessica and I have and the love we share. I'm here to empower others and share the importance of including all those who have disabilities. - I would like to make... Someone with a hearing disability stood up and said, "We have someone here, "Addis Sintayehu, who is amazing--very similar to you. He uses his feet, and we'd like to hear him." Let's go over to that table. Hello. OK. He's going to show you how to eat. The piece of meat. OK. All right. Oh, wow. You did it on the first one. How spicy? Mm... Ebba explained that part of the cultural thing is to share by feeding each other. You're expressing your love for someone by feeding them? Yay! Ha ha ha! Mmm! Thank you. He's like, "You're OK." We were eating, and there on Ethiopian TV was my presentation, but that's not what was special. It was Addis Sintayehu speaking to everyone, sharing with the world that he's a human being, he's accomplished, and he should be seen. That's how it all has to start. Hi! Hi. You helped me see more, too. How could I ever forget you? I realize this trip has been... This trip has been life-changing for me, and it has really taught me how my life could bring great purpose to so many, and I don't realize how much of an impact I can make. 3 years ago, I would have never imagined doing all of this, but now I wouldn't want to do anything else. Without objection, continuing the debate on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities treaty. - Today, there are over one billion people with disabilities, and 80 % of them live in developing countries. Disability rights is an issue that the world cannot afford to overlook. - We want to be part of a worldwide effort that says, "You know, it's not right. "It's not OK to leave a baby on the side of the road to die," just simply because that baby has Down Syndrome. - Some of my colleagues might be satisfied with the assurances provided by some lawyers within the State Department to the effect that this is entirely compatible with US law, to the effect that it would not impose any additional, new, different obligations on US law. I'm not satisfied that that is the case. I therefore object. Thank you, Mr. President. - The yeas are 61. The nays are 38. Two-thirds of the senators present not having voted in the affirmative, the resolution of ratification is not agreed to. - This was kind of a slam dunk--you'd think. - How did this happen? - Next year, you might bring this up again? - Yes. We're going to come back. When we left Ethiopia, I felt powerless in the situations like Hodan, like Tiyan and Tariku. Their voices and their stories haunted me. - This is Chambliss. We're not going to meet him, but then Isakson, we will meet. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is based on the Americans with Disabilities Act, which allowed me to fly a plane, drive a car, and go to school. We actually spent about 10 days going from Dire Dawa to Harerge, these little provincial areas. We spent a couple days in Addis, also. Woman, center: So explain, you know, "We need you." You can ask, "What's your position," which is perfect, you know? Woman, left: But then the follow-up is, "We need your support for this treaty." OK. - Why take this message to other people? - Just hearing stories like Hodan, who hadn't been in school for 16 years. She was kept at home. This CRPD is going to ensure that these children who have disabilities have the same opportunities that I've been given. Thank you for taking the time to allow us to come and chat with you about the CRPD. When they ask an old man about a beautiful woman visiting, I always say yes. Oh, look at there! That's the Ercoupe airplane that I fly. Hey, Jessica. Uh-huh? Let me introduce you to someone. I had to stop. I was behind you in the other way. My friend-- I'm sorry if I cry. My friend just found out last week that she's 21 weeks along with a boy who doesn't have arms, and she's so fearful that he is going to struggle in life, and she's going through a lot right now, and I just passed you, and I was hoping to give you my business card. She's right here in Washington. I would love to meet with her and just tell her that he's going to be just fine. I know children all over the country who are born without arms. We'll make an effort to do whatever we can with her. I know it's tough. I know you're here to lobby, and I know that takes time. Oh, no. We will-- This is what my life is about. Taking a step into disability advocacy has really made sense of everything that I've done. We're going to head over to the church. Let's see. Yeah. Really good, Pat. Thank you. The chocolate's, like, overwhelming, with chocolate chips in it. It's been very hard. My mom has shown some serious resilience. She's never once complained about coming to chemo or going to radiation. I always knew she was a strong person, but to see her go through all that she has. It's slowed her down a little bit, but her spirit is same. Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I dedicated you. How are you? Hello, Senator. How are you? I'm Jessica Cox. This is my husband Patrick. Hey, Patrick. How are you, sir? Nice to meet you. This will provide opportunities for those with disabilities. I'm a pilot myself, so I fly with my feet, but I know that those opportunities of becoming a pilot, despite my disability, would not have possible if it wasn't for the ADA, so I'm hoping to ensure that all those abroad can be given that same opportunity. I know when you're pursuing a cause, the cause is-- but there are actually some real legal issues that I think can be resolved, and I think, you know-- but they've got to be willing to want to do that. So far, it has been received with more of a pat on the hat. Let's just make sure that through international law or, you know, subversion, if you will, of the commerce clause, that we try to address those issues. So I thank you, OK? I want to thank Secretary Kerry for being here today, and as I mentioned to some of the leading advocates just a minute ago, I hope that this hearing will be more about substance and less about cheerleading. There are countries where children with disabilities are warehoused from birth, denied even a birth certificate. Not a real person. The United States has the ability to impact that by the passage of this treaty. I talk all the time about being fearless and not having a fear, but I fear that politics is going to get in the way of such a huge, important decision that could help millions of people. - Tonight, the most powerful storm on the planet has slammed directly into the Philippines. Super typhoon Haiyan could be the strongest of any storm ever. Hi, Mom. Hi. I wish you were here. I miss traveling with you. Yeah. It's going to be hard to miss the therapy, you know. Yeah. People often ask me, where do you get your strength, and I think about my mom and the resilience that I see time and time again with the Filipino people. Good morning. Nice to see you. This is my husband Patrick. Hi. How are you? So, over 4,000 people have been killed, more than 18,000 injured. In the discussion with the ambassador, we talked about how wonderful it would be to be able to bring a message of hope and resilience. That was something my mom taught me, is just not to give up. There are people here who still need support. It's ongoing support they need. Why here, the strongest typhoon in history? We came on the area where the boats had been washed up by the waves, and all these big fishing boats. One of the boats had painted on it, "Lord, forgive us," and... it made me realize that a lot of people may have thought that it was their fault. The most important thing was my family and being there for my mom. If she could right now, she would be here. If she had the physical capability to, she would. It's really... This is where my mother was born. This is where all of her 12 siblings were born. This is where her father passed away when she was only months old. To see all the destruction that happened to it, it's really sad. What was the sound like? My God. You know what? It was... it was... I put my fingers in here because I couldn't hear anymore. That was the first time I experienced a whirling wind. Whirling wind. Were you scared? 1, 2, 3. Ready. 1, 2 ,3. So, how many tents are here total? 100. 100? Hallelujah Hallelu, hallelu Hallelujah I know that people here are questioning their own faith. What am I going to tell them? What can I tell them? I travel all over the world to inspire people, but I know this trip, what has given me my strength and faith is how everyone has dealt with the typhoon and to know that you can still smile... and you can get through the struggles. Because I remember as a child, how difficult it was and how much I questioned my own faith as to why God allowed something like this to happen to me. I realize that had I not been given the struggles that I've had throughout my life, I wouldn't have the opportunity to inspire so many people. God has a plan for each of us, and we become stronger with our own struggles. Amen. If I fly an airplane without arms, what is it that you cannot do? For inspiring women, especially those with disabilities, by her exemplary accomplishments. It's very rewarding to know that my mom was my strength when I was weak, and now I'm able to be the strength and give that back to her home country. Thank you for this great honor. I know so much of my success is because of the Filipino spirit of not giving up, of having the strength to succeed, and to know that with God, all things are possible. It's amazing how when you're grateful and you move forward with your life, things are going to happen, opportunities are going to come. I can tell you today that if I was given the choice, I wouldn't want the arms because of the wonderful things I've been able to do and the lives that I've been able to touch. What time was your appointment, again? 3:00? 3:00? Yeah. I did not expect to live for Jessica's wedding because they were always telling me "3 months." But in my thinking, I said no, I want to fight for this. I'm a fighter. So I'm still here. OK. I think she's ready for a grandchild, and that will come in time, but I don't know about right now. Are you ready for a grandchild, Mom? Yes. Definitely. As long as you're willing to baby-sit. Ha ha! Yes. Got it? Hold on. All I was thinking was, I would take care of Jessica and all her-- all her life, and it's the opposite now. She's taking care of me. Mom, thank you! I think you like pink. Thank you, Mom. That was--she know ice-cream cake is my favorite of all time. A toast to Jessica for her birthday. Before we got married, Jessica was so worried about losing her independence, but I think I've given up a fair amount of my independence in exchange for a wonderful relationship. Life with Jessica is just amazing. At the rate that I've been going and Patrick and I together have been going as a team, there is no telling where we'll be in the next year or so. We've been able to be a voice for people with disabilities, and I hope it can continue, because so many people with disabilities have been shoved aside. And if they need me, I'll be there. Yeah! Wow! Whoo. Wow!
