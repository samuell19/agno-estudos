SEDER-MASOCHISM Written by God, Moses, or A Series of Patriarchal Males, depending on whom you ask Moses Animated and Directed by Nina Paley Moses Produced by Nina Paley and Producer X Moses Hoop-de-doo-de-doo-de Moses Moses! Moses! Moses! Behold this golden goblet of wine. It is a symbol of joy as we celebrate the festival of Passover. Many long years ago on this night, our ancestors heard the call of freedom and tonight that call rings out once more, commanding us to champion the cause of the oppressed peoples throughout the world. I don't know, are you recording? I can't tell. I think so... Don't waste this. I hope so... Okay. All right! So what do you want me to do? I want you to sing the... the...Passover... uh... You know, you'd go like, baruch-atah-adonai-eluh... No, that's not what I sang on Passover. I really don't know what I used to... Well, OK, there's this part, which is the Kaddish And I will do the best I can, Nina - excellent - Because it's been years and years and years - When was the last Seder you did? When did you leave the house? (Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe Who createst the fruit of the vine.) Sorry, when I'm not burping I'll do it again. We now drink our first cup of wine. It is customary for each person to drink four cups of wine at the Seder table. These four cups symbolize the ancient Four Freedoms which are represented in the liberation of the Jewish people from bondage. Ooh-ahh, rat-a-tat-boom! Make the sound of a jet plane zoom. Ooh-ahh, rat-a-tat boom! Make the sound of a bomb. You've got to believe in something Why not believe in me? You've got to believe in something Why not believe in me? Tell me, brother, What have I - I - done to you to make you mean and treat me the way you do? Go on and wave your flag, brother, start your revolution. I'm willing to let you do your thing, Tell me why are you blind when it comes to mine? You've got to believe in something Why not believe in me? Me, me, me, me, believe in me You've got to believe in something Ooh yeah Why not believe in me? Why don't you let the Wilson sisters set you free? Take the chain off your brain Believe in me, Oh I said now - Take the chain off your brain Believe, yeah hey You always want to be like that We're under you, can't believe STOP! Take a look at yourself. Don't refuse You've got to believe in something Why not believe in me? Why don't you let the Wilson sisters set you free? You've got to believe in something Why not believe in me? You've got to believe in something Why not believe in me? You've got to believe in something Why not believe in me? We were once the slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt And the Lord, our God, delivered us from bondage by His might. Go down, Moses. Way down in Egypt land. Tell old Pharaoh... to... LET MY PEOPLE GO! Now, when Israel was in Egypt land... LET MY PEOPLE GO! Oppressed so hard they could not stand... LET MY PEOPLE GO! So the Lord said, Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land. Tell old Pharaohs to let my people go. LET MY PEOPLE GO. So Moses went to Egypt land. LET MY PEOPLE GO He made old Pharaoh understand. LET MY PEOPLE GO Yes, the Lord said: Go down, Moses, Way down in Egypt land. Tell old Pharaohs to let my people go. LET MY PEOPLE GO "Thus spoke the Lord," bold Moses said, LET MY PEOPLE GO "If not, I'll smite your first-born dead." LET MY PEOPLE GO 'Cause the Lord said, Go down, Moses Way down in Egypt land Tell old Pharaoh to LET MY PEOPLE GO! WAY DOWN IN EGYPT LAND Tell old Pharaoh to let my people GO! Oh, when I was a kid I knew this, word by word. And this is what we did in Hebrew school. We learned these things by rote. And I could do everything, and then at the Seder I would have a certain... You know, as the kid, the youngest male, I would have certain... special roles, like asking about... asking the Four Questions... ...one of which is, "Why is this night... ...whatever..." THE SEDER PLATE Shankbone Roasted Egg Parsley Bitter Herbs Romaine Lettuce Apple, nuts, wine and honey Matzoh "Ha lachma anya." This is the bread of poverty which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. Let all who are hungry and needy enter, and eat with us. Oh, here's a question. Yeah? Since you cared so little about it, or for it, why did you keep doing Passover anyway? Well I still believed in the fact that, uh, you had a heritage, and I wanted you guys to know something about your heritage. And it was a happy, kind of, uh, I mean there are the sad times, the Exodus and all that stuff... which is the sad part of Passover... but, uh... It was happy and sad both. You know, happy from the fact that Jews were getting out of Egypt, and it was, uh... sad that... there had to be all these mean Jews before the Pharaoh... gave in to the Jewish people, and... they had an opportunity to for Moses to lead them through the split Red Sea, and then of course, the Sea came back together again and killed all these Egyptians... But, uh... I thought you should know a little something about the heritage of a... of what was basically our family. We now reach the reading of the Ten Plagues which God brought to the Egyptians. As each one of these Plagues is mentioned, a drop of wine is spilled from the goblet into a plate. THE TEN PLAGUES BLOOD Which a-way, which a-way, do that blood-red river run? From my back window to the rising sun. Red river, red river, won't you tell me what to do? Mmmm, worried as I can be. Which a-way, which a-way, do that blood-red river run? From my back window to the rising sun. FROGS FROGS! They hop to that. FROGS! Hop to that. FROGS! They hop to that. FROGS! Hop to that. FROGS! They hop to that. FROGS! Hop to that. FROGS! They hop to that. FROGS! Hop to that. And some might say that he's a dummy. LICE Tiny insects in my hair, Tiny insects everywhere. Tiny insects in my pants. Watching insects make romance. Insects make you make me want to DANCE! Dance, dance They make me want to dance! Dance, dance Those insects make me want to dance! FLIES Flying insects everywhere. Flying insects buzzing, buzzing, buzzing through the air. Just like little diamonds in the sky. Insects buzzing in my eye! Buzzing insects make me want to DANCE! Dance, dance! They make me want to dance, dance, dance. Those insects make me dance, dance, dance. They make me want to dance, dance, dance. Those insects make me want to dance! MURRAIN Dead animals Dead animals Dead animals Dead anima-ha-hals Dead animals, dead animals Dead animals, dead animals Dead animals, dead animals. BOILS I GOT BLISTERS! HAIL Hail, hail, the gang's all here! What the duke do we care? Hail, hail, we're full of cheer! What the duke do we care now? LOCUSTS Insects make me scream and shout! They don't know what life's about. They don't have blood, they've got too many legs, too little brains in their heads! They know they'll rule the world someday, They bite and sting me anyway! They bite and sting and SUCK! They bite and sting and suck suck suck! They bite and sting and suck suck suck suck... DANCE! Stomp! Dance! Those insects make me.... DARKNESS Who turned the light out on my life? And who turned my day into night? You made a mess out of my life. You don't seem to know the wrong from right. Somebody said you were leaving, and I didn't know what to do. I thought I'd never stop grieving; I just couldn't tear myself from you! And, uh, you know, We all sat around the table, including Uncle Herzl... And Uncle Herzl rejected to the part where you did... a drop to signify... To signify the killing of the firstborn Egyptians. My uncle got infuriated with that, he didn't like that part. Why? Well who wants to kill people? What? I mean, we don't want to go around killing people, right? But you shed the drop because - the idea is you shed the drop because you're sympathizing. You're like, "oh, this was a terrible thing." So you're going to spill some of the wine from your cup because it was such a bad thing. Yeah but I think literally it was in celebration of the killing of the firstborn Egyptians and my uncle didn't like it. But anyhow, he and my father would have a big fight every Seder at that point. Every year they'd have a big fight. DEATH OF THE FIRSTBORN EGYPTIANS Falling stars you wished upon are cinders now, and now they're gone. Their residue festoons my fetid field. Unfeeling husks of lovers past, the shells are all that ever last. I've taken everything that they've concealed. Whoever told you like was fair? Look around you, everywhere the cruelty of nature is displayed. Why the scorn? Why the surprise? Everything that's born must die and it isn't I who made the world that way. What wicked little twist of fate placed you here upon my plate? Here, where no one hears your cries? Where was your God, to steer you through? Perhaps your God's forsaken you. Otherwise, why lead you here to die? I I know the way how I'll melt away now I know the way. I'm feeling bliss now, dissolved to mist how strangely I go away Now I finally know. It's merely moments now, moments now until your feeble flesh bends to my will and it will so rest your weary head. There'll be no pain, no pain at all, as everything you are dissolves Your fate resolved upon my silky threads. I I know the way how I'll melt away now I know the way. I'm feeling bliss now, dissolved to mist how strangely I go away Now I finally know. I I know the way how I'll melt away now I know the way. I'm feeling bliss now, dissolved to mist how strangely I go away Now I finally know. Oh! All right now go! Walk out the door Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.... Let us therefore sing a song of thanks to God! Not only for protecting us from our enemies, but also for the great and magnificent gifts He has bestowed upon us: His Torah, The Sabbath, and the Festivals. And now His greatest gift, which we in this generation have been privileged to witness: The return of our land! The land of Israel! DAYENU! There's a land that I see where the children are free and I say it ain't far to this land from where we are. Take my hand, come with me where the children are free Come with me, take my hand and we'll live In a land where the river runs free! In a land through the green country! In a land through a shining sea! And you and me are free to be you and me. I see a land, bright and clear, and the time's coming near when we'll live in this land, you and me, hand in hand. Take my hand, come along, lend your voice to my song. Come along, take my hand, sing a song: For a land where the river runs free! For a land through the green country! For a land through a shining sea! For a land where the horses run free! And you and me are free to be you and me. Every boy in this land grows to be his own man. In this land every girl grows to be her own woman. Take my hand, come with me where the children are free Come with me, take my hand, and we'll run to a land where the river runs free! To a land through the green country! To a land to a shining sea! To a land where the horses run free! To a land where the children are free! And you and me are free to be, and you and me are free to be, and you and me are free to be You and me. You and me! You and me! You and me! And you and me are free to be You and me. The second half of our Seder begins with the Grace After Meals. Praised be Thou, oh Lord God, King of the world, who feeds the entire universe with His goodness, His grace, and His lovingkindness. He gives bread to all flesh, and in His great goodness food has never been lacking for us, for He feeds and supports everyone. Our God, Our Father, feed us, support us, sustain us. Do you think the events in Exodus actually happened? What the hell kind of question is that to ask me? I don't care! Now if you feel that you can't go on, because all of your hope is gone, and your life is filled with much confusion until happiness is just an illusion and your world around is crumbling down, Darling Reach out Come on girl, reach on out for me Reach out Reach out for me Ha! I'll be there with the love that will shelter you I'll be there with the love that will see you through. When you feel lost, and about to give up 'cause your best just ain't good enough and you feel the world has grown cold and you're drifting out all on your own and you need a hand to hold, Darling Reach out Come on girl, reach out for me Reach out Reach out for me Ha! I'll be there to love and comfort you And I'll be there to cherish and care for you. I can tell the way you hang your head you're without love now now you're afraid And through your tears you look around, but there's no peace of mind to be found I know what you're thinking: You're alone now, no love of your own but Darling, Reach out Come on girl, reach out for me Reach out Just look over your shoulder I'll be there to give you all the love you need And I'll be there You can always depend on me I'll be there... Our third cup of wine is called: Elijah's Cup. In Jewish tradition, the Prophet Elijah is the messenger of God. Appointed to herald the era of the messiah, the era of perfect happiness when all peoples throughout the world shall be free. We drink the third cup, The Cup of Elijah and then refill our cups for the fourth and last time. So you have no religious inclinations whatsoever These days? Ever. Ever? Yeah. Oh when I was a kid, yeah. Really? Yeah, when I was a kid I bought into a lot of this stuff. Remember that was before I was Bar Mitzvah’ed at age thirteen. You know I thought that’s the way... I’m told by my parents and by the Sunday School people that all these stories and I thought, OK, that’s my... uh... well I shouldn’t say my tribe, but that’s the way my the people I know closest all believe and obviously that had to be the truth and all that stuff and, uh... yeah, I bought into that stuff That, uh, Judaism went back so many thousand years and this and that... eh, but after a while some of that didn’t make complete sense either. OK? You know, so... I mean there are people who spend a lot of time, they are great religious scholars, they want to understand all these little nuances about Judaism and things like that and I figure, OK, fine. Just don’t push it down my throat. They hold up half the sky. Woman I can hardly express My mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness After all, I’m forever in your debt. And woman, I will try to express my inner feeling, and thankfulness for showing me the meaning of success Oooh, oooh oooh oooh well, well doo-doo-doo-doo-dooo Oooooohhh oooooh oooh ooooh oooh well, well Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Woman, I know you understand the little child inside the man Please remember, my life is in your hands And woman, hold me close to your heart however distant, don’t keep us apart After all, it is written in the stars Ooooooooooooh ooh oooh ooh ooh well, well doo-doo-doo-doo-dooo OoooOooohh oOOh oooH oOh oooo well, well doo-doo-doo-dooo-dooo Woman please let me explain I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain So let me tell you again and again and again I love you Yeah, yeah Now and forever I looooove yooooooouuu Yeah, yeah Now and forever I looOOOOVVe yooooOOOOOoooouuu yeah yeah now and forever I used to love Her but I had to kill Her I used to love Her but I had to kill Her Lying, cheating, hurting, that’s all you seem to do Messing around with every guy in town putting me down for thinking of someone new Always the same, playing your game drives me insane, troubles gonna come to you One of these days, and it won’t be long you’ll look for me but, baby, I’ll be gone. This is all I’ve got to say to you woman: Your time is gonna come Your time is gonna come Your time is gonna come Your time is gonna come Made up my mind break you this time won’t be so fine it's my turn to cry Do what you want, I won’t take the brunt it’s fading away can’t feel you any more Don’t care what you say ‘cause I’m going away to stay gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart People talking all around, watch out woman no longer is the joke gonna be on my heart You’ve been bad to me, woman, but it’s coming back home to you Your time is gonna come Your time is gonna come Your time is gonna come Your time is gonna come Your time is gonna come bye-bye baby Your time is gonna come Now that the four cups of wine have been consumed, the official ceremony is over. But wait! Our rejoicing has only begun! It’s time for some rhythmic Hasidic melodies. Rhythm, of course! Rhythm has always been the very soul of Hasidic prayer! It’s strange I don’t know what it will be like for me tonight I look at you as I did the first time. More words, always words the same words I don’t know how else to tell you just words You are that beautiful love story I will never stop reading Easy words fragile words aren’t they pretty You are the one of today and of tomorrow Too pretty. You are forever my only truth. But the time for dreaming is over memories also fade when we forget them You are the wind that makes violins sing, and you carry the perfume of roses Toffees, sweets, and chocolates Sometimes I don’t understand you. Thanks, not for me give them to another who likes the wind and the rose’s perfume Tender, sugar-coated words taste sweet on the lips but not in my heart one more word- Words, words, words Listen to me. words, words, words Please! words, words, words I swear to you! words, words, words, words, words words and more words that you sow in the wind. I more or less dropped out of Judaism in my teenage years, early teenage years And I really quit when I was in Wisconsin and it was hard to fast for Yom Kippur When I was a graduate student in Wisconsin and all these things were more difficult and I just said the hell with it. What about the pressure that you had? Like, Bubbie Zelda was always wanting us to be What? Bar Mitzvah'ed and Bat Mitzvah'ed Oh, she would have loved that Well, she would have loved that. But I wasn’t interested in that. That’s very brave. I know first-hand what it’s like to do something that your family’s not- that your family doesn’t like. Oh yeah? Like what? Like dropping out of college That was just stupidity on your part. It has nothing to do with religion. There was no way we could prevent that. I mean, I think you’ve made some mistakes in life, Nina but we’re not here to talk about your mistakes Unless you want me to talk about your mistakes I mean, I put those all behind me years ago. What? You know how, I mean you look funny there but I I still think a Bachelor’s Degree from those days would have been of use to you. Don’t you think that Bubbie Zelda would have said the same thing about you know having a Bat Mitzvah? I dunno. Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river Too many lonely sighs have drifted out to sea You lay your bets and then you pay the price The things we do for love. The things we do for love. Communication is the problem to the answer You’ve got her number and your hand is on the phone The weather's turned and all the lines are down The things we do for love. The things we do for love. Like walking in the rain and the snow when there’s nowhere to go When you’re feeling like a part of you is dying And you’re looking for the answer in her eyes You think you’re gonna break up, then she says she wants to make up Ooh, you make me love you Ooh, you’ve gone away Ooh, you have me crawling up a wall Like walking in the rain and the snow when there’s nowhere to go When you’re feeling like a part of you is dying and you’re looking for the answer in her eyes You think you’re gonna break up then she says she wants to make up Ooh, you make me love you Ohh, you’ve gone away Ohh, you have me crawling up a wall A compromise would surely help the situation agree to disagree, but disagree to part when after all, it’s just a compromise of the things we do for love. The things we do for love The things we do for love The things we do for love The things we do for love The things we do for love The things we do for love The things we do for love The things we do for love I think you gotta check your equipment. I am checking my equipment- This seems like a lot of fuss for- No no, I’m just, uh, I’m just I know but it seems like a lot of fuss if you want to record people smoothly and things like that Well you’re always adjusting this thing! Oh, would you like me to stop adjusting? The microphone’s sort of going into your neck. That’s not bothering me one bit! No no, but it’s uh, affecting the- If a microphone is pushed up against something... Oh you mean the sound quality. Well, if you have a problem... Well I can try to attach the microphone... to another part of your gown... I’ll bet that will be better. OK If you attach it so it keeps falling off you know what the problem’s gonna be. Yeah. God is male He’s old, He’s white. His beard is long, His asshole’s tight. He watches everything you do, and then He throws the Book at you. Mighty Father in the sky Mighty chromosomes XY Like the Sons of Israel God’s a patriarchal male. And now our concluding song: Chad Gadya. This is a folk song written especially for children. That is, children from six to sixty! It tells the story of a father who bought a little goat Although it also tells about a cat, a dog, and many other things Listen well to this song because it really tells the entire story of the Jewish people throughout their long history. I think when it comes to our kids we did a pretty good we were very lucky I mean, you didn’t follow everything I wanted you to do Josh didn't Liz didn’t, but... And I think again when it come to financial success and remember someday you’re gonna have to eat and you know you need money to eat, Nina, and to live and I hope that in this lousy economy you don’t suddenly find that you’re completely at sea. Now, as long as your mother is alive and we have the house, you’ll have a place to go if it’s absolutely necessary and we hope that doesn’t happen, but at least you’ve got some degree of fallback But, uh... I would have been happier if you had been more financially independent by now. So anyway, you know, if you had had if you had built up more money in your bank account and stuff like that I think I’d feel I could rest more easily about you guys, but... Since there’s nothing I can do about it, ah... And you know my own life is coming to an end, one of these days soon right here in Urbana, ah... You know I just hope that things go well for you. As I say, I’d feel a lot better if you had more security, but that’s a Father’s job. So anyway, what else? Next year in Jerusalem! This land is mine. God gave this land to me! This brave and ancient land to me! And when the morning sun reveals her hills and plains then I see a land where children can run free So take my hand and walk this land with me. and walk this lovely land with me. Though I am just a man, when you are by my side with the help of God I know I can be strong! Though I am just a man, when you are by my side, with the help of God I know I can be strong! To make this land our home, if I must fight, I’ll fight, to make this land our own Until I die, This land is mine! Give me that old time religion Hallelujah! Good enough for me. Give me that old time religion Looking for religion Good religion how we used to be Give me that old time religion, Lord Hallelujah! Good enough for me. Give me that old time religion Looking for religion. Good religion that we used to be. Give me that old time religion, Lord Hallalujah! Good enough for me. Oh, give me that old time religion I’m looking for religion that we used to be Give me that old time religion, Lord Hallalujah! Good enough for me. It was good enough for my Mother Hallelujah! It was good enough for my father Hallelujah! It will help me through my problems Hallelujah! Good enough for me. It was good enough for Paul and Silas Hallelujah! It was good for the Hebrew children Hallelujah! It will help you Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Good enough for me. And then you drink the wine.
