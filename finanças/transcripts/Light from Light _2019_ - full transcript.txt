Some people, mainly friends of my mom's, thought that I had this gift because of these dreams I'd have. I only had a couple, or, uh, a couple that turned out to be prophetic. One was about the church where I grew up, and I had this dream about this lady at the church that was in the choir. I didn't know her. She was older, maybe, - 10 years older than my mom. - And how old were you? I think I was eight. Anyway, um, this lady, Miss Louise, is what we all call her, was standing at the front of the church, and another lady came out from behind the door at the front, and they looked almost like twins. And they hugged each other, and then I woke up. Interesting. I didn't think anything of it, but I told my mom about it. And then a few days later, I remember the doorbell ringing, and I remember my mom calling out for me and asking me to come downstairs, and I came downstairs, and Miss Louise was there at the door crying. And, she hugged me, and all she could say was thank you. And she left. My mom had told her over the phone about the dream, and on hearing it, she came over immediately. Like she put the phone down and drove over. It, um, it turned out that Louise's sister, who lived in Florida, had recently died of cancer. Was it her twin? - No. - Still, wow. And do you still have those dreams now? No. When did they stop? Well, after that one, I started telling my mom and other people all my dreams, but, only a couple meant anything to anybody, and nothing was quite like that first one, so. At some point, I just stopped telling people about them. And did you have other experiences with the paranormal before joining the team? I had questions. Like? Just questions. If you're just tuning in, my guest is Sheila Garvin, formerly of Smoky Mountain Paranormal Research. Sheila, how can folks reach you if they want you to do an investigation? Well, I'm between teams right now, so they could reach out to my old team, or I guess they could email me. Would you consider yourself a believer, or a skeptic? About ghosts? I don't know. I don't know what I am. Hello, class. Today I'll be talking about the country of Denmark. There are over 180 days of rain in Denmark every year. That's every other day. Famous Danes, or as I like to call them, Great Danes, include Hans Christian Anderson and Niels Bohr. Denmark also has one of the largest proportions of Nobel Prize winners in the world. They also have... - What's wrong? - No, it's... Those are really interesting facts. But it's supposed to focus on one key thing about the country. Right, um... Yeah, I couldn't really decide on what to do. So, I thought this would be more interesting. It's probably fine. You, you go. Okay. For my presentation on Japan, I will be discussing the Japanese tea ceremony. Though, no one thing could possibly summarize a nation or it's people, particularly one with such a rich history, the tea ceremony speaks to values that have been a part of Japan for centuries. Wait, what? - It's a tea set. - Yeah, it's cute. Sorry, that, that's awesome. The tea ceremony takes place in a chashitsu, which is a tea room. Guests are asked to enter a door which is about half the size of a regular door, allowing them to kneel into the room inspiring humility, bringing everyone to an equal level. Today, my guest is paranormal investigator - Sheila Garvin. - Hi. - You know one of the things... - Owen? I love about this show is all the different types of people I get to talk to. It doesn't sound like he's frightened by what's happening, but my advice hasn't been comforting him. I think the worst part for him is he doesn't know if he's imagining things or not. Like I said, I am between groups right now. No, I understand. So, should I reach out to the group you were working with? Do you think this is for real? Well, I think it's definitely real for him. Okay. I mean, I, I guess I can talk to anyone. Good. This is Richard's phone number, email, and address. Well, I'll see if I can help. Thank you, again. Can I ask do you believe in ghosts? Some would describe Christ when he was resurrected as a ghost. So, you think it's possible? I suppose I believe anything's possible. - Mom. - Hmm? Wake up. What time is it? You need to be there in an hour. Okay. Were you dreaming? No. I'm up, I'm up. Good luck. - I know you'll do good. - Mmm okay. Anything you say is totally confidential. This is just between you and me. A couple times, uh, it felt like something had its hand on me. Was the hand strong, was it forceful? - Did it scare you? - It was gentle. It felt like my wife. Suzanne. It just feels like she's still here. Okay. She died, when? Just shy a year ago. She was killed in a plane crash. I'm so sorry. Did that happen nearby? It was all in the news. I'll find it. I'm sorry. What can you tell me about her? Suzanne worked for the government out in Oak Ridge. Um... A couple years ago, she quit to work for a company that contracted with the government. Same stuff. Better pay. Uh, I'm sorry, what do you... what do you wanna know? Anything. We met in high school. She spent a lot of time reading in this room. It's just weird trying to describe someone like this. You know what, we can wait. You wanna show me the house? Right, yeah, yeah. - I guess... - How long have you lived here? I guess it'll be 12 years in April. This place has been in Suzanne's family for a while. We moved in when her parents passed. This library was here when we moved in. But the rest of the books are Suzanne's. She was always trying to get me to read. Do you know if anyone ever died in the house? I'm sure someone probably did at one point, but I know her parents didn't. I think if the place was haunted by someone from a long time ago, Suzanne and I would have seen it. This is where I thought I saw my keys move. Where were they when you found them? Well, they were still there. They had just moved to where Suzanne would stand when we would talk in here. It happened a few times. After the second time, I... I guess it was a couple months ago, I went to the doctor, had my vision examined. They said it was probably just stress. It would pass with time. I haven't been getting much sleep, so I'm sure that's some of it. Let me show you upstairs. When did you reach out to Father Martin? Uh, after the medical tests. He's your priest? He officiated our wedding and Suzanne's funeral. I was baptized and everything, but I don't go to church. Suzanne did. This is the room where the lights were flickering. I've been staying in here since Suzanne died. Okay, so, I should tell you that I don't have insurance for this kind of stuff. So, if you want me to investigate, then you have to take responsibility. That okay? Yeah. Would you mind signing something that says that? Okay. Looks like laundry day. I've been meaning to do those sheets and deal with that stuff. Here. Let me know one night next week when you can get out of the house. I will. What will I owe you? - What... - Nothing. Money just makes things more complicated. Okay. See ya. Hang in there. It's like the whole class was just yelling and yelling and yelling. So, seems like it could be fun. I'm gonna... I gotta get to class. I'll... see you later. Testing, testing, test, test, test. Testing, test. House of Richard Barnes. September 12, 9:08 p.m. Is anyone here? If you are here and would like to communicate, let yourself be known. Is anyone here? If you'd like to communicate, let yourself be known. If you'd like to communicate, let yourself be known. What's up? Hey, what time are you getting home? I don't know. I can't talk right now. Can I borrow the car for paintball tomorrow? I can give you a ride to work. Um... My phone's gonna die. Yeah, that's fine. I need to go, is everything okay? Yeah, just studying with Lucy. Okay. I'll see you later. - Love you. - Love you. Can you turn the lights off? Just for a second? Is anyone here? If you are here and would like to communicate, let yourself be known. Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Suzanne? Oh. Oh shit. Oh... God... Ohhh.. Oh, great Ugh. I do. I do wanna go. But why haven't you asked me? Because. Because why? You can tell me. It's okay. I don't wanna marry you. I mean, I'm not ready for that. I mean, that's okay. Then what's the point? Say we go to the dance, and we have a really great time, and we end up kissing, or whatever, and... I don't know. Maybe... maybe I'd fall in love with you. But, you're going to college. You're gonna get all these scholarship offers, and - I don't know if I'm... - Owen? Just let me finish. You're going to college, and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm probably staying here. So, that means that if we get together, then we're probably gonna break up at some point. So, what's the point of getting together if you already know it's gonna end? That's it? Thank you for sharing. Hi, Lucy. Owen, I'm gonna need you to help me this weekend. With what? With the investigation. Can I help? You need to ask your mom. Okay. I've never done this before. I know. Okay, well we need equipment. We don't have any of the stuff your team had. Can you get it? I need you to sign here and here. If you look over it, it'll be fine. You don't have to worry... Yeah. Hello? Hey. Yeah. No, I understand. You've got to pay it off. Oh, no, I mean I wish I could, but thing's just really tight right now, you know. When would that be? Some of you may have had encounters with the paranormal, some of you may be skeptics, for now. Whatever brought you here, you spent your heard-earned cash to be here, so, let's dig into some of the ideas about what ghosts are, the scientific principles we use to identify and prove their presence, and the technology Sheila and I use to do it. So, Roddy's gonna show you the DVR recorder with infra-red cameras, and he'll also show you the audio recorders that we use to search for electronic voice phenomena. Over here, I have a thermal scanner, so, this can be used to look for any cold spots that might be present. Um, it's easy to use. You just point it at an area, pull the trigger, and you're looking for any significant changes in temperature. Here's some change. Awesome. There's more in the car. How's it coming? No problem. Found the manual online. Doing okay out there? So, Lucy's been popping up a lot lately. I'm actually happy to have the help. So, what's up? - What do you mean? - You know, is it serious? You can tell me. - You should. - Uh, it isn't anything. So, it really can't be serious. I just told her that I... I don't see a point in getting together since she's going to be leaving. Hey, how do I know if I'm doing the right thing? With Lucy? I don't wanna hurt her. Well, don't let worrying about that decide what's best for you. Good man. Okay, are you ready to go? - Did you get enough to eat? - Yes, thank you, I'm all set. Hey, let's go. So, you like this guy? He's okay. I mean, do you like him, like him? Um, no. You know, it's just doing a lot for this guy not to get paid. Do you ever talk to Wayne? No, I don't talk to any of my exes. Why not? I don't wanna get into this right now. Who is Wayne? Wayne was an idiot and a liar. He's who got mom into ghost hunting. I wanted to get into it anyway. Don't fall in love with someone just because they treat you nice. But isn't that what you're supposed to want? Everyone treats you nice at first. Things only matter if they last. I want a camera in the parlor, one in the basement out back, and one in both of the upstairs bedrooms. Oh and Lucy, leave the light on in the first bedroom upstairs, okay. Yes ma'am. Six foot four. Okay, you guys almost done? Yeah, camera's recording. Everything seems pretty normal. Great. We're almost ready to lock down the house. Can I help? Um, I'm just go set this to record in the kitchen. The idea here is we're gonna see if any voices that we can't hear - get recorded. - Okay. Suzanne? If you're here, can you speak to us? We can just let it record. Well, do we need to hang around here? No, I think we can walk around. Y'all don't go too far. Can we go to that barn? Yeah. It's fine. Good kids. Whatever you find out, this has meant a lot. I know you must miss her. I do. It's complicated. The plane crash, - it was a private plane. - Yeah, they were headed to a conference. Said the papers. Suzanne had told me she was driving to a conference in Cincinnati. When I didn't hear she had arrive safely, I reached out to some friends, and eventually the police. Nobody knew anything. Next day, I got a call from a detective. Was I sure she was headed north, I was like, "Yeah." Then, like, 12 hours later they showed up. It was late. That's when they told me about the plane crash. I was like, "Plane crash?" Year or so before this, she had told me about him. She said something happened with another man that it was over. Just couple dates. When they told me his name, I knew then. The police... They understood the situation. Said, none of this was relevant to tell the reporters. So, that was that. Anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sure she would have been sorry, too. But still, I wish I had... You ask yourself pretty heavy questions. What her last moments were like? Did she even think of me? Did she have time to think of me. Not like the other stuff. Like? I was wondering, why live. When was this? When I started thinking it was her. Are you still asking that? Not really. No. But if it was her, if there is an afterlife, maybe that's why she's here, 'cause she's lonely, she wants me to be with her. We can never know if you'd join her. I know, I'm, I'm just saying it occurred to me. I understand. I listened to that radio interview you did. The prophetic dreams. That happened. Whatever it means, that happened. People think ghosts are scary. I think it would be wonderful if they were real. So, there was this one time, just one, I thought I had an experience with a ghost. My father. It was a few weeks after he died. I was like 15. He drank himself to death. I didn't see him much, I didn't visit him in the hospital or anything. He wasn't in my life. But I knew him. He'd been around... when I was younger. Anyway... I'd been... over at a friend's house, and we'd smoked a joint and watched a movie, and I just... I was walking home. I'm pretty sure my head had cleared up by that point, and... I thought I saw him at the mailbox. My mom and I had kept living in the house long after he left us, so it was a house where he lived at one point. Anyway, it was really dark, like maybe one streetlight, but I could have sworn I saw him there putting something in the mailbox, a letter, I guess. And I just stood there for a second, and he puts this thing in the box, and then walks away into the distance. So, I ran after him, and he kind of dissolved away, and I stopped running. I had run, I don't know, how many yards. We passed the mailbox. So, I walked back to it, and I opened the box and looked inside. I mean, there was nothing there. But I felt this sense. It was like my heart was gonna explode, not from the running. Like I felt really alive. But it was... Sad? Yeah. I never felt that way again, ever. And the next day, I wasn't sure I'd seen any of that or felt that at all. It was probably me just being a dumb stoned teenager. Suzanne used to smoke occasionally. You know, if you think it would help. I stopped, my senior year, when I had my boy. Wanted kids. Never had 'em. Is he going to college? He doesn't seem too interested. - What are your plans? - Plans? After he moves out? You know, I'll... My job... It's not bad. I mean, it's not what I wanted to do with my life, you know, but I don't know what else I would do at this point. Suzanne sometimes said she felt like she was sleepwalking through life. People say things like, "I don't regret." I don't trust people who say that. Sorry. I get this way sometimes. Let me go check on things. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. She got stung by a wasp. She was fine at first, and now... - What is is? - She can't breathe. She's allergic. I got an EpiPen in the house. - Get your car. - Okay. Okay, don't worry. We're gonna get you to the hospital right away, okay. - All right, be right back. - Hurry. Okay. You're gonna be okay. Okay, okay. - Did you find it? - Got it. Rachel? This is Sheila, Owen's mom. Hi. Um... So, Lucy is fine, Lucy is, is... She's totally fine. She did get stung by a wasp. Yeah, and she, um, I think, I think there was an allergic reaction. Right. Hey. Hi. - Come in, sorry. - Thanks. You feeling okay? Yeah, better, a lot better. I wanted to thank you for taking care of me. That's yours, I can't. It's yours now. I'm still a little puffy. I just wanted to give that to you first chance I had. Thank you. I got a new piece of jewelry. - Looks awesome. - Thanks. I'm looking at the footage if you wanna come see it. Yeah. Do you want anything to drink? No, I'm good. Did you find anything? No, not yet. Just logging stuff. Lucy. You need to go home. My mom knows I'm here. That's not the point. We were just sleeping. Lucy's mom was gonna be worried. Did you watch the video? I saw. I'm afraid you're gonna get hurt. I'm looking at some colleges. I would take out the loans. Just letting you know. Don't say that. I mean, if you're gonna do that, don't say it that way. - Don't say it that way. - What? Blessed be God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Blessed be his Kingdom, now and forever. Amen. All mighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you, no secrets are hid. Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit that we may perfectly love you and worthily magnify your Holy name through Christ, our Lord. Amen. I think this will help Richard so much. Good. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. I just wanted there to be more. Why? Because everything ends. Well, anyway. Thank you for the opportunity. Look I was thinking, did you ever go up to see the site of the crash up in the mountains? The police said it's pretty far off any trail. You think you'd be up for hiking up there? Mom? Maybe you shouldn't show Richard that video. I'm not gonna lie to him. He wants to know. Does he? Just an idea. You ready? Yeah. Let's say it is a ghost, and that it's her. Would you want her around? - I - don't know, I mean. It sounds sad. Sad for her, I mean. And if it's not a ghost? In some ways, that would be easier. But I would still be disappointed. Hey. So, you should watch this. Camera in the basement. What is that, a mouse? Making the lights flicker on and off in the bedroom. This doesn't explain everything. It doesn't explain the feelings you were describing, doesn't explain the keys. I've been exhausted. The keys could be in my imagination. This... This looks like a pretty good explanation. That's all I ever wanted. If you knew about this, why'd you bring me up here? I don't know, I guess I thought you might need to see it. Thank you. Well, shit. I never said I wanted it to be her. No, I guess you didn't. Are you disappointed? Why are you worried about me? No, I'm not disappointed. Is that everything? - Looks like it. - Okay. Just gonna do a quick dummy check, - and we'll get out of here. - Okay. Chapter 18. Anna looked at Dolly's thin, care-worn face with its wrinkles filled with dust from the road and she was on the point of saying what she was thinking. That is, that Dolly had got thinner, but conscious that she, herself, had grown handsomer, and that Dolly's eyes were telling her so. She sighed and began to speak about herself. "You're looking at me," she said, "and wondering how I can be happy in my position. "Well, it's shameful to confess, but I, "I'm inexcusably happy. "Something magical has happened to me like a dream "when you're frightened, panic stricken, "and all of a sudden you wake up, "and all the horrors are no more. "I have waked up. "I have lived through the misery, the dread, "and now for a long while past, "especially since we've been here. "I've been so happy." I've never done this, I've never, I never felt something like this. So, I'm just... You know, I'm just gonna try. Suzanne? Are you here? Can you come to this place? To talk? To listen? Richard wants to talk with you. I'll be right outside. I love you too.
