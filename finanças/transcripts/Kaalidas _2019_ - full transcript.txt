From morning onwards, there was power rip problem. Just now, we've checked. Is it only when the girl had fallen? It happens, often. We've informed the SI in yesterday's meeting. Why CCTV cameras didn't work when particular incident happened? Unfortunately, it might be a coincidence. Sir, Sir has come. Sir... Recently, you know that a girl has fallen to death. Since morning, I've been staying only here. She is an innocent. Was there any new person in the flats when the girl fell down? I can't see clearly due to vision problem.

Exactly, she was on the top of it. Singham, come here. Sir... Climb up. Sir... Climb up. Okay, sir. Jump from there. Sir, I'm scared. Jump. Brother, turn back and jump. That girl had jumped only from the stool. Yes, sir. If she had jumped from there, She would've fallen upside down. If someone had pushed her from here... ...due to angular motion, she would've fallen upside down. Wasn't this the position she was found? Yes, sir. There was no footprint marks on the wall. Come up. Aravind, put a cross mark on it. Ganesh, hold his legs. Go There is no need for someone to push. For this fifty feet height, Though the girl would've jumped from the stool. By angular motion... ...she has fallen upside down due to her body weight. There is no chance of foot prints on the wall. Okay. Where is her husband? Where is your wife's mobile phone? Sir, I don't know. She uses her phone only to make calls and nothing else. The day before she died, you both were quarrelling. Not a day has passed without quarrelling? We don't have children. My mother called me which she doesn't like... ...that made her to quarrel with me. But, I was told something differently. What's that? You're unfit. That's why, both were indulged in quarrelling. These people will convey, what they are interested in. I took care of her like a child. Instead of impregnating, he took care of her like a child. This is what will happen. Does anyone have a bullet in this flats? Not now, sir. Two months before a guy had a bullet. But, he vacated the house. The beads look beautiful. I didn't say, I'll rent you the house. In the morning... ...when I saw your face, I thought you will. That's why... You said that you aren't the owner of this house. Did you close the EMI's? Because, till the loan gets closed the banker is the owner of the house. That's why, I asked you. Whether the EMI is closed or not you've to pay the rent only to me. With or without GST?
