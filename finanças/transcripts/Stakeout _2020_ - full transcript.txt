Shocking news, this morning after human remains were discovered at a beachside estate in the Olympic peninsula. The bodies of seven unidentified adult males were found on the premises with lacerations and significant blood loss. Officers rushed to the scene after a 911 call from a concerned neighbor, we've obtained exclusive access to this recording. [Police recording] Police are searching for a suspect linked to several unusual items scattered around the estate. you, or anyone you know, has any information regarding the incident, please contact authorities immediately. More on the stories as it develops. -Carol, on to you. [Music] Does this place have a pool? It smells like it has a pool. [Music] Ah, not bad. Yeah. I see, again, okay! I didn't think we’d get set up so fast. [Laughs] Are you ready? Yeah! Hi, my name is Jon Velmont. I am a filmmaker based out of Seattle. I have been making films pretty much my whole life. You guys are distracting me, what's going on? Is it okay? It just works, we’re figuring out. It looks dumb, that's all. Some of the films that I made in college were such shorts as Christopher, Craving. Me and my DPN, we did a commercial for PureAyre. I did a short called The Middle Child which isn't done yet, but it will be soon, and it's going to be fantastic. It's going to be really scary, it's got this cursed doll, and it's just. but it's a real mind-bender. But just a few years ago, I finished my first feature, which is called Transfusion, and it's a vampire horror film, psychological thriller, let's go psychological thriller. And it's about this junkie, and he's roaming the streets at night, and he finds this used needle, and he picks it up, and he sticks in his arm, and he starts turning into a vampire. Because it was a vampire stuck the needle in him, and then the junkie sticks in it turns into a vampire, and well, you get the idea. It didn't go anywhere, it played at some festivals, and it did end up on streaming, and then a couple of months ago, I get this email from someone who saw it. And they sent me, here I can get this, I can read this for you, just take a minute. So, this is the email I got, Hello, my name is Abel Martin. I recently saw your film “Transfusion” online. As a movie buff, I found it very entertaining but as an authority on vampires, I find the film contains many inaccuracies. I write you because I myself am a vampire hunter. I currently reside in Matheson, a small town in Western Washington that has in years experienced a rash of unexplained disappearances. Through my research, I have included this to be the work of a cult of vampires, and have taken it upon myself to eradicate this threat. Here's where you come in, knowing that, one, you are a filmmaker, and two, you have a level of knowledge, and/or interest in vampires. I invite you to document my efforts to inform the public and save lives. I hope this message finds you well, I have included my contact info below, Abel”. Now, an average fan letter, it’s exciting. This is the night before guys; this is the night before our first shooting day with Abel. You know, I was just talking to him, and he actually is going to let us go on some Stakeouts with him. I want this to be something that's cinematic, but I also want this to be like a real human story, you know, I want this to play to all kinds of audiences. We should probably get some sleep. Sure. Let's call it at night, alright. Sure. Alright, just turn up here, almost there. Now, it should be up here on the left. Okay. He said to meet him around back, so I'll just park here, and we'll go through the gate there. Alright, let's do it. Let's open. I guess we'll just knock. Hello? Maybe he's not at home. Oh, god! Sorry, I didn't hear you pull up. Abel, right? Yeah, Jon? Yeah. You want to come in? Sure, if that's not a problem. Yes, just…Come on. …right this way. You can just make yourself at home here. So, this is it? Yeah, that's right. This is interesting. Don't touch that. Is there something special about this? That was my first… Your first kill. I was 10 years old, my dad took me out to Quinault. Were you close to your dad? Taught me everything I know. Wow! Oh, I guess, we can sit down here. Alright! So, this is HQ. Yeah, that's right, we've got the bedroom, the bathroom, the laundry room. What about upstairs? It's complicated. So, Robert, how long has Abel been living here? Oh gosh, I'd say we've been renting out our basement to him for almost three years now. Then what's that been like? I mean that's fine for the most part, he does keep late hours, and spends a lot of time in the backyard, but... You don't have a problem with the whole vampire-hunting thing? As long as he keeps paying the rent, it's fine by me. Though, I could do without the holy water. Lord bless this water, in the name of you, the son the holy ghost. Don't you need a priest for that? Oh, I am a priest, only took me two hours. I should make around seven gallons a month, perhaps eight if it's busy. Do you really need that much? I mean, no, I don't need that much. But if I went to a gas station, I wouldn't put in five dollars worth of gas, and then come back two days later, just to fill her up again. No, I need a full tank. First off, I appreciate you reaching out to us. Of course. I guess my first question is, why vampires? Well, my father was a vampire hunter, and so was his father and his father and so on. So, you were born into it. I like to think it was born into me, ever since I could draw breath, that's all I've ever known. Why hunt them, why not try to reason with them? Do you have any idea how many people go missing each year? 692,856. They didn't just go on vacation. But if it was that big of a problem, don't you think we'd notice them? Oh, we have. Instances of vampires go all the way back to ancient Mesopotamia. And they're all sorts of famous cases, Mercy Brown, Elizabeth Bathory, Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes is a vampire. That's right! Just look at the last few years of his life. He drank blood, he blacked out all the windows in his penthouse, and he hung around with Mormons, who are not true Christians, by the way. This is where I do all of my research. I try to keep an eye out for any local sightings of unusual behavior. But I can always stay up-to-date, thanks to the Bloodsucker’s Board. So, this is like some kind of forum. Sure, you could say that, but the way I look at it is, the Bloodsucker’s Board is an underground network of people sharing theories, facts, sightings, and fan art. So, tell me about the problem here in Matheson. Well, a lot of college kids come out here because of our lenient liquor laws. A few months ago, one of them went missing. Because of vampires? Here's the thing, vampire cults exist in all towns, and all countries, and every city you could think of. Interesting, how did you come up with this theory? It's not a theory; it's a fact. They're planning something, something big. Okay! Now, is there a reason this day is circled? Oh yes, that's the blood moon. Have you ever heard of it? It sounds familiar, but do you think maybe, you could explain it to the camera for anyone who may not know. Alright, well, the blood moon is this eclipse in which the moon is doused in a kind of red coppery light. It happens roughly every two years. Suppose you could say, it's a religious holiday. Oh, like Easter? Yes, but with more human sacrifice. Yes, but with more human sacrifice. Yeah, but not the fun kind. Before every Stakeout, I like to get myself psyched up, you know, it's like every one of these nights could be my last, so you got to live it to the fullest. You see, the thing about life is… Wait! [Music] So Abel, what are some common misconceptions about vampires? I don't know. What did you have in mind? Oh, do they turn into bats? Do they turn into bats? Of course not! How would that be physically possible? I don't know; they're I guess, they're magical, I guess, right? Nothing's that magical that something could turn into a full-grown man, and transform into a tiny creature. No, it's ridiculous. Okay, what about reflections? Like, if a vampire looks in a mirror, and he's brushing his teeth, does he see a floating toothbrush, or is there a guy there? A floating toothbrush, that would be quite the sight. No, it's very simple. A vampire, as I've said, is just flesh and blood like you and me. So, of course, he would show up in a mirror. I suppose vampires have no souls, so I guess that's where people go wrong thinking that they wouldn't show up in a mirror. But no, you can see them in mirrors. So, did you have anything else in mind? Oh, yeah, do they sparkle? Oh! What did you say? It was just, do they sparkle, like in twilight? Yeah, I figured. You know what those movies did to my legitimacy, set this industry back in years. I'm sorry. It's okay, you're new to this, but come on, do they sparkle? So, let me get this straight, a vampire lives across the street. Two, by my account. Are we going inside? Not yet, got to get to lay the lamb first. Take note of their comings and goings. Gathering information, that's what a Stakeout's all about. So, we're not leaving the car. I don't like to go into any situation unless I know what's on the other side of that door. It could be a trapdoor, sex dungeon. Maybe both. You take this. Is there a reason you keep these back here? For health reasons mostly, drinking your own urine is the paradigm of recycling. You drink your own urine? Hold that thought. No, it's not them. You alright? Oh, yeah. No, just tired. I hear you, saying easy, that's for sure. So, when was the last time you got one? Got one? Yeah, you know. Blah! Got one, yes. Well, if I'm being honest, it's been a while. They catch on. They certainly have gotten smarter these past three years, and I've tried to keep up, but times have changed. The sun's coming up. Hey? Is that it? Yep, that's all she wrote. Does anybody want a McMuffin or something? So, are we listening for anything in particular. Ssshhh… We got it. So, these are all my house sounds. So, these are like ambient samples. I like to think of them as pieces, you know, everything makes noise even if you don't think, you can hear it. So, I record it. If you take these to, like galleries or… We call them listening parties. What did Abel think of all this? How much time do you have? I met Abel eight years ago. I was working at a dairy queen, and he came in one day, just caked head to toe in mud. He said I’d been out all night hunting vampires, and asked if he could use the bathroom. After that, we started talking, and he launches into this whole story about ridding the world of vampires. I thought it was hilarious. But there's something about him. This enthusiasm, and energy, and sense of adventure. After that day, he kept coming back, waited off, and we're together for three years. Every book he read, every movie we watched, it was vampires this, vampires that, he said it was for research. Do you want to know what we did for our one-year anniversary? What? Well, we ordered pizza, and we watched Blade II. I know it's the best one, but it doesn't make it any better. So, all the time you were together, did you ever see any evidence of vampires or a vampire cult? A cult, fuck no. He never showed me anything. He said it was a burden he had to carry alone. Do you believe in vampires? Do you? I killed a lot of vampires when I was with Tony. Though, as far as I saw, the less she knew, the better. Because you cared about her. I suppose you could say that. Do you still? I tell you what, you want to see something neat? This was a big one, you can tell just from the mass alone. I think it was about 6’4, 250 pounds. What's that supposed to be? Oh, a vampire. That's what you have spread out all here. Yeah, I put the piles around to ward off vampires from coming here. That's why? Well, that and it raises the pH level of my lawn. Today's the big day. I saw this baby on the internet tonight. I had to have it. 150 pounds, draw weight, full carbon limbs. Yes, nobody fucks with a guy holding a crossbow. Perfect! Do you want to try? Oh no, that's fine, no. You sure? I mean I could, I guess I could try if you think that's a good idea. Okay, so what do I do here? Just use the scope and… Okay, I see. …Just fire when you're ready. Shoot the head? Or the torso, it's up to you. Okay. Felt good, right? Yeah, it felt, it did feel pretty good, yeah! Should we fire some more? Sure. [Music] Back in the day, the government hired a top-secret organization of bounty hunters for their skills. Like your dad? Well, yes, but eventually, these organizations were infiltrated by double agents. Thankfully, he never lived long enough to see those days. What happened to him? Well, one night, he went out, and he never came back. Sadly, this job does have an expiration date. And so, if you want to survive, you've got to diversify. And me, I'm a survivor. I know it may not look glamorous, but the tips are good, and it gives me time to think and strategize, also always sprinkle a little of this garlic on the pizza, just my own fun little way of doing my part. Abel's worked his six years. He started out as an oven cleaner before moving over to toppings, Borno, then lastly started delivering. What's he like as an employee? Intense, but that's not uncommon in this line of work. I think he had a rough upbringing. Do you know about Abel's activities outside of work? I do. Does that upset you at all? Look, we all have had our running’s with the supernatural, even though some of us won't admit it. Can you elaborate on that? I never thought I'd tell this story. Okay, five years ago, when I was still doing deliveries here, I was close to closing time, and a call came in. Only thing I could hear was laughing and yelling, and this went on for a long time, so it got to a point where I was about to hang up. Then finally, this guy's voice comes on the line, and he orders 10 pies delivered to 237 Stanley place. It took me about 45 minutes to bake them up, and box them, grabbed the directions, and headed out. Before I knew what I was like in the sticks, I turned on to this dirt road. And there was like, no lights, no noise, nothing, but you know, up in the distance, I could see the house, except it wasn't a house. What was there? It was just charred remains, so I called the number again, this time the line was disconnected. So, I went back, and a co-worker was back at the shop, and he said what? I told him what happened. He's like, well, where'd you take the pies, and I said 237 Stanley place. And his face went white. It's like, the blood just drained all out of his head, and I'm like what? He's like, don't you know 237 Stanley place burned down during a party 15 years ago. Get this, 15 years from that night. Explain that! Maybe it was a prank. A prank is when you take a dump on the hood of your best bud’s car, this was evil. So, I mean I don't know. Maybe Abel's right. Maybe there is something out there. Even if there isn't, I mean who's he really hurting? You want something thick, so you can break through the ribs. Some people prefer to go through the sternum, but that does run the risk of splintering. Ironwood's good if you want something strong though. I prefer white oak. I suppose I'm old-fashioned that way. You think this is good; this is good stuff. Yeah, yeah, I mean you want to see him, you know, every day. His everyday life, right? Because this is, it's a documentary, but we're trying to build a narrative of his life, you know, we're trying to see him getting up in the morning, going to his job… As a pizza delivery boy. As a pizza, it’s not, it’s a serious thing, okay, I know, he was going to go for pizzas. [Laughs] People are vampires. [Laughs] But no, there is… We are not making fun of them. This is a true. This is a serious story, it's a serious story. [Laughs] So, what are we doing? Well, I was just looking at this message I got from a contact in the Highlands neighborhood. I think we've got a nest. A nest, sounds like a place of lot of vampires. I would hope so. I think I drove by this place. What was that? Yeah, it’s a week ago. I noticed there was something off about it. Like what? Well, for one, it looked like its inhabitants hadn't been there for probably a month. I wonder if the cult killed the family members, and then set up some sort of hideout or breeding ground of some sort. What are we doing? Well, we've got to hit this place up right now, got to do it in the daylight. You mean, break-in, right now? Yes, there's no time like the present. [Music] What? I said, are you sure this is a good idea? Oh yeah, I can turn this up. Alright, that's the spot. That's the nest. Yeah, that's right. It just looks like a normal house. I know, but I haven't seen a single person go in there in weeks. So, we're just going to go in the broad daylight in the middle of a neighborhood. Yes, that's right, you can use that if you get into trouble. I don't know guys. Maybe we should give it a few minutes and kind of feel things out. Let's go boys. Guys, you are supposed to… Come on, come on. Is there like a door, like a window? Yes, I believe there's a window back here, we can break-in. You're not scared, are you, Jony boy? Come on, come on. Hey, maybe, I could just stand guard out here? Come on, we've made it this far. Get in here, Jony boy. This is the vampire den. It could be. Yeah because it looks like a garage. Maybe that's what they want us to think. So, you pour this everywhere? Give me that. That should do the trick. It’s interesting. Do you think that's actually signed by Van Morr? Shit! Abel! There's something over here. What? Human remains. What? Just take a look. It's a Halloween decoration. What is that? I think someone's here. Shit, we got to… god damn it. Come on. It was a bad idea. Shut up. What are you doing? Alright. What? I’m trying. That was our nest? Look, it was a piece of bad information, I get it all the time. I thought it was a sure thing. You know, I thought it was. It happens to the best of us. Fuck! It’s okay, we'll get it next time. Do you like cracked pepper? Jon? Has that ever happened before, I mean going into the wrong house? A couple of times. A couple? I mean I think the cops arrest the right guy every time. I would hope so. I just, I need more than hunches,you know, I just. I need to see something, otherwise there's no narrative, we're just chickens running around with their heads cut off. You know, chicken once lived for 18 months after having its head chopped off. I don't think that's true. It's on Wikipedia. Okay, so now what? The blood moon, of course. What about it? Sure, something will happen there. I swear my life on it. Here, eat up. Today we're going to meet my top guy, Draven. Draven? Yes, Draven's what I would call a vampire historian. Anything you want to know not only does he know it, but he also probably came up with it. And this Draven has the information we need. That's right. He's got the 411 on the blood moon, this could be big. So, we're just going in through the garage. That's right, Draven has a process. Hey. I bid you welcome. We accept your welcome and bid you hello. Okay. You guys like to dabble at all? Yeah, used to dabble in my… So, Draven, how have you been? Well, I've been better. I can tell you that much. Mom is sick, has been for the last week. We're out of pizza rolls, she can't go to the grocery store to get the pizza rolls because she's sick. She's like, oh go ahead, take my savings card. I was like, mom you know, I can't drive. She's like take the bus just like, you know, there's vampires. I got it, yes, that's… Yeah. So, Draven, what exactly do you do? I do many things, not least of which vampire tracker, vampire historian, vampire hunter, vampire criminologist, vampire cryptozoologist, garlic cider micro brewer, pizza roll connoisseur, macaroni and cheese connoisseur, sonic the hedgehog expanded universe auteur, Bloodsucker’s forum moderator, vampire comedian as I do. I do jokes about the vampires. I don't do comedy for them. Yeah, but he wouldn't. No one would want to do comedy for them; their sense of humor is terrible. They suck. [Laughs] And the last but not the least, musician. One, two, three, four, Deborah doesn't love me anymore. [Music] Draven! What, what? Stop!! You are embarrassing me. This is what I wanted to show you. This was taken last Monday night outside the shopping park where I work, part-time. But just wait for it. You see this guy, right? Looks like a guy in a hoodie. That's what it looks like. It's what the government wants you to think, but when he moves, there, you see it? Looks like a drunk guy in a hoodie. You can't see the vampiric aura coming off of him. You do? Yes, yes, we both do after years and years of vampiric training. It's obvious. He's been consuming, and I think he wants more, yes. You can tell all this from that. Oh, I wouldn't mistake that walk for anything, he's clearly out for blood. Alright, smartass. If you're not going to believe my video evidence, maybe my composite sketch will convince you. [Laughs] What? Is this the guy? This is the guy. Yes, yes. You're serious. His eyes are, you see that, they're too far apart. As a vampire's eyes would and should be. Look it's not about the aesthetic, it's about the content. Look, he's got this… This is as accurate; this is anatomically correct. Oh no, this is a cult member for sure. This is a cult member for sure. Alright, this guy, I work the graveyard shift, alright. Don't judge me, but this guy comes in every night, every single night, doesn't buy anything, doesn't say anything, just goes to the bathroom. Until last night, he finally comes up to the counter and asks me a question. What did he ask? He said, how do I get to the Bixby trail? Fuck. What? I don't get it. Abel! What? You don't know about the Bixby trail? No. Forks Washington. It's a prank. Oh, a dead end. The home of twilight. Mm-hm. God damn it. Great. Abel, look, I know, I know it's forex, I know it's twilight, but this is, this is real. I know it, I feel it. I know, but we've run into this before. Abel, when have I ever steered you wrong? Hold on! Mom, mom, give us a second here, okay? We're talking. Mom, shut the fuck up. Alright, I'm talking with my fucking friends. Jesus! You hungry? Sure. I've always thought I was given a higher calling, like this was destiny for me to hunt vampires. Don't you feel that way? Abel, let me tell you something. Writers write books because they need to be written. Singers sing songs because they need to be sung. Sonic the hedgehog goes fast because he's got to go fast. And we hunt and kill vampires because if we don't, they'll overtake the entire planet, and kill us all in our sleep or awake, either way. Nothing that’s beneficial, alright? Don't ever doubt yourself, man. Alright, I guess I'll have to keep killing. You kill them. I need to take a pee. I can hop out real quick. Just hold it in. It'll just take a second, let's just take a second. Hold on. Okay, fine. See? Just a second Oh shit, I think I dropped my keys. Hey, you should have a light on. I think I dropped my keys. Why did you take your keys out? Well, they were in my pocket, and they dropped. Just turn the lights on. Let's just take a second. I just get out. Fine, fine. Get out. Fuck, what is that? What is that? It's like a; it's like a hood or something. Probably, came off his robe. Well, where did he go? Abel, Abel! What? Should we head back? I suppose. At least, we found something. What the fuck was that? I don't know. Who was that guy? He looked like he could have been in some sort of cult. I mean you go through the neighborhood every night, right? You see this stuff all the time, right? I haven't seen someone dressed like that before. I can tell you that. So, you have no idea what that is? I mean, I could guess. He was fast. It was like chasing after a rabid dog. I figured that you did this all the time, so you could catch him, I figured you were in good enough shape to where you can actually catch it. I mean I’m in decent shape, but yes, you saw that guy, just. He was in a robe. Sort of a bit of a crossroads right now. Used up most of our funding. I don't know if we have anything we can show. The best we have is chasing around a guy in a robe. I mean, okay, maybe, I didn't think we'd actually see vampires, but I don't know at least, maybe, we'd get a bleed on the missing person's case. Instead, we have a film about a guy who makes holy water in his bathtub. Is it entertaining? Maybe. Is it a film? I don't know. I don't know. Hello? Abel? Abel? He’s not there. What's this? You're cordially invited to Tawny and… Shit! Come on. Come on, let's go. Oh hey, Robert, you haven't seen Abel anywhere, have you? Thanks. Hey. Oh, hey! So, she invited you. Yep. That must mean she at least values you as a friend. Oh, great! You know, I was thinking we could go out again to the same spot that we went last night, and try another Stakeout. I don't think so. You serious? Yeah, I'm just not feeling it tonight. I got an idea. Hello? Yeah, Tawny? Yes. Yeah, hi, this is Jon from the doc. Okay. Yeah, so Abel got your invitation. Uh-huh. And he's not taking it too well. I see. I can't even convince him to go out on a Stakeout tonight. So, what do you want? Yeah, I was wondering if we could meet, maybe, the four of us could get together over dinner, and put this whole thing behind us. I don't think that's a good idea. I mean better him ruin the dinner than a whole wedding, right? I don't know. I mean, you did invite him. No, I didn't, Jeremy did. Your fiancée? As a sign of goodwill or something, listen I should go. One dinner, I'll straighten them out, explain the situation, I'll bring a bottle of wine. Will there be a camera? I mean, it is a documentary. Fine. But that's it, no more filming after that. I understand. Fingers crossed. So, how you feeling? I don't know. I mean if this is something that's blocking you mentally, some kind of hang-up. We got to find some way to get past it. Yeah, I suppose you're right. We're just going to talk. I'm sure, he's a nice guy. That's what I'm afraid of. Hello. Hello. Hey, she's from cabernet. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm Jon by the way. Hey, Jeremy. Yeah. So just sit anywhere here is good. Yeah, you could, you guys can, you can take a seat. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. Well, thanks for having us. No problem. So, Jeremy, what do you do? I work at a music store, Melody Time. It's close by. I teach guitar, sometimes, violin, piano to kids mostly, just like help get them off the streets. Yeah, yeah. Hey Abel, you like music, right? Everybody in the world likes music. Let's talk about something else. We both met at the same gallery. He was playing a show, and I was having a listening party which kind of drowned each other out. And a year later, we're here. A year? Well, when you know, you know. So, Abel, do you want? I think I've got to go to the bathroom. Yeah, bathroom's second door on the right. Easy there. I'm fine. So, Tawny tells me you hunt vampires. Oh my God! A secret vampiric cult, yes. Oh really? I've lived in Matheson my whole life, you know that. And I've never ever once heard or seen anything like that. Yes, well, that's why it's secret. Well… Yeah, I'm sure it's all good fun. Do you shop at hobby lobby? Is there an aisle for what you do? This is no hobby. I have a crossbow, and a license to kill. How do you even get that? Can we please talk about something else, guys? No, no, seriously, Tawny what, these vampires, do they sparkle too? I mean, Jesus Christ, man, how old are you? And what you've been doing with your life, what you've been doing to Tawny? I mean, see this vampire stuff, are you kidding me right now? Oh, Jesus! Okay, okay. Everybody out! Stop filming. Turn it off. Guys!!! Jesus! Oh no, go, go, man. Sorry! Oh god! I'm so sorry, babe. Get away from me. Oh. Food was good. Are you alright. You didn't have to do that. Do what? Try and fix my relationship. Well, you never know if you never try. Yeah, so we going out again tomorrow. Do you want to pull over? No, just keep driving. All right. I think he's a little under the weather. Abel. Is there anything we can get you? Alka-seltzer tablets, right. Do you want some Alka-seltzer tablets? Should we leave him? I tell you what. I think we're going to call it a night, so if you need anything at all, we're just going to be in the other room. Does that sound okay? Yeah, yeah. He's fine, he's fine, he's good. Well, come on, let's call it a night. He's fine. Jesus, what are you doing? Turn off the light. Outside. What's that? What is it? Don't. Get out of my face. Hold on, give me a minute. Give me a minute. So, we just heard some shuffling outside, and we think Abel might be out in the backyard, so we're going to take a look. Come on, let’s go. Okay.Abel, what are you doing? Shit. Is that Tawny stuff? What is this, what's going on? Maybe it is all a joke. You talking about what Jeremy said. I've never seen a vampire. What? I've been going out on Stakeouts my whole life. I've never seen a single one. You've never seen a single vampire. You know what this movie's about, right? Yeah. Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me right now? Do you know what we're doing, we're going out here, and we're filming you, fucking going out, and hunting vampires, and you've never even seen one. I know, I know. Do you know how much time we put in it, how much money we put into this? Is there anything else? My dad never hunted vampires. Oh, big surprise, yeah, I'm sure. Is he even dead? No, he sells insurance, he lives with my mom and… Oh my God! Oh my God! what the fuck are we doing out here? What am I supposed to do with this? Fuck. Look, the blood moon's coming up, and… I don’t give a shit about the blood moon. If you've never seen anything before, why would you see anything now? I just have a really good feeling about this one. Really good feeling. Oh, you've had a really good feeling the whole time, and look, where it's gotten us, right? It's gotten us here. We're burning fucking greeting cards in a barbecue grill. I don't even know. I don't even know why I'm surprised by any of this. This whole thing has been a fucking joke. Alright, cut. Jesus! Hey, Jon. Yeah? I think you might have overreacted back there a little bit. I don't know. I just need some time to think. time to think. Sure. I mean, we knew, right? You don’t need to film this. You can turn it off right now. I think we should just go home. I mean we've put this much time in already, I don't know how much we filmed, I don't know how much money we've spent, I don't know how much sleep we've lost. But are you willing to gamble on him finding a vampire at this point if everything he's told us is a lie? I mean we saw the guy in the red robe. If that was a vampire, you think we'd all still be here. I don't know. I don't know what a vampire is. That's why I'm doing this thing because I'm trying to find the truth, right? That's what you do with a documentary, you're looking for the truth, right? But it's hard to find the truth when the person that you're talking to is lying right to your face and making you feel like an idiot. I mean this is a guy, this is a guy who has a crossbow in his car, right? This is a guy who has the potential to kill someone right, and I feel like we have been here, you know, filming him like he is some sort of movie star almost egging him on, what's to stop him from actually taking this thing, and actually putting it to use, right?Like that, that could be on us. I don't, how's that on us? Because we've been there the whole time, and we've been like, been like, okay, this is okay, this is okay to do. We're like, we're with you, right, and then we're going to suddenly say we're not with them. I feel like, we have to be there, right. We have to be there to make sure he doesn't take this too far. Or I don't know maybe, he's onto something, and we've, we do finally see something. You want to try talking him out of being a vampire hunter. I don't know. I don't know what I want to talk to him about. I don't know, I kind of just… It’s your call. I feel like, we have a responsibility to see this out. We're here. We have a film to make. We should finish it. All right. [Soundtrack] I thought you would have left by now. I guess not. So, you're finishing your documentary? I want you to be honest with me. When we started this, you said you did this whole thing because of your dad, which I now know is a lie. So, what is all this? Well, I was six years old, my parents had taken me to the grocery store, and sitting on one of the shelves I saw this box of Count Chocula. I know it probably sounds silly, but it scared the hell out of me. I had nightmares about it for weeks. So, every time they took me back to the store, I just stand there starring at a box of cereal. I just wanted to understand the fear where it was coming from. I also wanted to figure out how to overcome that fear. So, all the stuff with the ashes, and the frame stake, and all that stuff, none of that's that's real? I thought if I could make it feel real, then I'd have a purpose because otherwise, I don't know. Then, what do I have, everyone else is right, and I'm just nothing, I'm nobody. So what do we do now? Well, you could always finish your movie. [Music] Well, I'm not going to lie, there's not quite as much around here as I thought there would be. You expecting there to be vampire men walking around. No, but I don't know. Maybe, some more like decorations, posters, something. If they have like Edward's diner, do you know who that is from the book? Oh yes, the Robert Patterson. Pattinson. Do you really think something could go down out here? Yes. Something bad. That's where bad things happen when you least expect it. Or, nobody sees it. Exactly, out of sight, out of mind. So, assuming there is anything out there, how many do you think there would be? Well, I'd put it anywhere between five and fifty. On the lower side, would be preferable both. I don't know like, feeling lucky. Not really. Well, I am. Now, we wait. Thrilling. Hey. Yes. Is that them? Yes, yes, just be cool. There's two of them. Okay. They just look like regular guys. I'm sorry, I know, I know, we went… Of course, of course, they look regular guys. Okay, alright, alright. Oh shit, okay, okay, keep it low. Should we like start the car? I don't want them to notice us. So, I mean what's the plan really with these guys? Well, just tail them, and see where they're going, and if it looks suspicious. Well, I'll keep tailing them. If it doesn't… Let's get out. What's that? Is that something? Yes. Wait, wait, hold on, he's going through the front door. Okay, okay, we'll go around the side. Let's see. Do you have water? Yes. Abel, Abel, so how do we get down there, you're actually going to shoot a crossbow, are you? That’s not the point. Come on. Kill the light, kill the light. What are they doing? Are those guys from before? Yeah, yeah. Oh my god, this is crazy. Just get down there. What? What? Do you hear that? I hope they backed out. Hey, is that fire? Look, the red robes. What are they doing? Seems to be some sort of ritual. What's that? What is that? What’s that in the cage? That’s a sacrifice. Holy shit. Fuck. Come on, come on. Oh god. Go, go! Kevin, what are you doing? Kevin, just leave it, come on. No!!! No!!! Go, go, go. Shit, did you hear that? Shit, come on, upstairs. Come on. Do you see that? Go! Go! Come on! Shit. Fuck!! Come on, go, go, go. Stop, stop, get off. Get off. Fuck Shit! Abel, Abel, they took Aaron. I know. They took him. We have to go find him. We can't. We don't… Come on. Where'd he go? Where are they? Where are they? Fuck! Where are we going? Where are we going? Hello, hello? What the fuck! What was that? You grabbed him. Come on. Come on. Ah, fuck. Alright! We did it. We sacrificed a mate, but we've done our part. Are you fucking kidding me? What? What? What? What is this? It's nothing, no. That’s fine. It was just like a scratch. It's nothing. Are you kidding me? It's nothing. I have to do this. What are you doing? Get the fuck off me!! Get the fuck off me!! What are you doing? What are you doing? I talk a lot about making sacrifices in order to do what I do. But I never really felt, like I'd actually sacrificed anything until now. I put people's lives in my hands, and I let them slip away. And now, I have to deal with that. I'm afraid I won't be able to finish the documentary. Taking my work on the road to protect myself and others. I'll try to make sure the film ends up in the right hands. And if I have any parting words, it's that evil is real and it's out there. [No dialogue] [Credits]
