Good morning, sis. You do know that mornings are the worst time to call me, right? I'm trying to plan mom's big birthday and I need your help. Mom's big... She's turning 59. But she refuses to have a 60th, so we have to do a big 59. Okay. Can I call you later? What's been going on with that guy you were seeing? Eric. Okay. Okay, Janelle, I can't do this right now, okay? I love you. Bye. Call Peter the doorman. Pete, it's Jade Taylor. Forgot to tell you on my way out, my ex is stopping by to pick up his things. We have an agreement, half an hour, no more. If that's a problem, let me know. Thank you. There you are. The congresswoman's office just called. She's coming over now for the interview. What? Now? Yes, now. She's been called back to DC for an emergency session so she's stopping by on the way to the airport. Okay. Prep studio three for filming. Studio three's on the air. - Studio two. - On the air. Studio one? - On the air. - On the air? Okay, get two field cameras and lighting set up on the 11th floor conference room. We do this remote. Remote from the CNB Headquarters? - Mm-hm. - Got it. Oh, here. How are you? Has he called? La rata. Should I ask? Okay, I'm fine. Don't worry. You're not fine. No one could be fine. People break up all the time, you know. Yeah, but not like this. He said he loved you, moved in, which is huge for you. And then- I can't do this right now. The Congresswoman is coming. The Congresswoman? The Congresswoman. That's good. That's good, Ted. And now just clarify, what year was that? What year was that, exactly? That would've been January 2014. 2014, okay. And you were at the time an assistant DA in your current district? The amount of information being leaked brings to mind the scandal that hit the New Jersey DA's office a few years back. What are your thoughts on that and where do you think these leaks are coming from? The amount of information being leaked brings to mind the scandal that hit the New Jersey DA's office a few years back. What are your thoughts on that and where do you think the leaks are coming from? Ted, I can't comment on an open case, you know that. But what I can say is that I can promise that we will be taking appropriate action pending the investigation. But don't you think the public deserves to know what happened and who was involved? I mean, these people are paid with tax payer dollars. The public will know the truth as soon as we do, Ted. So what you're saying is you never really loved me in the first place, hm? So what you're saying is you never really loved me in the first place. No. No! Let me rephrase the question. Look, I started you here as an intern and you were living with seven roommates doing coffee runs and editing puff pieces. You're now one of our most valued news producers and if what just happened had happened to anyone else, we wouldn't be having this conversation. Again, I am so sorry. We've known each other a long time Jade, and I know you going through a breakup. The truth is, I'm almost glad this has happened because I need you, Jade. And I'm worried your next step is about to be burnout. You've worked so hard to get here, but now you need to take a breath and the network wants you to take a leave of absence and that doesn't mean work from home. Well, I do have a ridiculous amount of vacation time racked up. I'll come back fresh, I'll show the top floor who I am, what I can do. You're going to need to do just that. What happened? We're going for a drink. Book me someplace chic and quiet, make sure there's a beach. Looks like I'm going on vacation. Excuse me. Is there a supermarket around here? Yes, ma'am we have a market. Great. Uh, this is it? You don't have anything bigger? This is it. I'll be quick, then. Where's your frozen food section? New York. Ah. Ah, well, this is it. Okay. Keys under the mat as instructed. Okay. I bet things are falling apart without me. Hm. And also, I don't want anyone besides you covering the Johnson case. He's evasive. You have to stay on him. Keep an eye out for Peter. I know he's gonna wanna steal that art scandal story. That is ours, and that's how I'm gonna get back on track. What else? Jade, what are you doing? Turn it off. You're on vacation. You should be at a beach bar or stargazing. Start a shell collection, anything. Stop. I am fine, and I'm perfectly capable of relaxing. Matter of fact, I'm going to relax right now. Good night. What was that? Who put that chair there? Hold it. Hold it right there. Who are you, and what are you doing here? And what have you done to my furniture? Huh? Excuse me? Who are you? This is my house. I live here. What? Well, not for the next two weeks you don't. What are you talking about? And put, put my lamp down. I rented this place, or rather my assistant did on Luxury Away. Look. This is my confirmation and the instructions. Here. Well, I am sorry to be the one to tell you this, but you have been properly scammed. This place is not for rent. They said that the keys would be under the mat and the keys were under the mat, so why would you do that? Well that's where I'll leave them because this is Maceo Island. But I, but I paid and then they... Look, I'm Ford, it's late. Clearly you have a situation, but I'm going to bed. You can crash here in the extra bedroom until the morning when you find something. No, thanks. Thanks but no thanks. I'm not staying at a stranger's house. Well, you already are. And the bedroom door locks. Plus you rearranged my furniture. Yeah, sorry about that, but yeah, I'm still not staying. Well I'm not exactly begging you. Look, I'm gonna go to bed and pretend that this never happened. Okay, go on. Don't worry about me. New York. Morning. No room at the inn? I've checked everything. It's a small island, so everything's booked. Well, little under the radar island is not exactly the best place to look for a last minute reservation, so. Right. Well, I'll get out of your way since it's morning and I'll put your furniture back where I found it, okay? Thank you. Sure. I really think this chair works right here, though. You should consider it. Thank you. I like it where I have it. It's just a suggestion. No, please, just... This place is amazing. What is it that you do? I'm not rich or anything, but it's easy to live a better life here. Well, I actually didn't wanna come here in the first place. I was literally forced to take a vacation, if you can believe it. Literally? Literally, yes. Well, a leave of absence. The vacation was my idea, 'cause apparently I don't know how to relax. You don't say. Well, that's what everyone keeps telling me, so. Hm. You know, I was thinking this painting, it- No. It's one thing to have a bad vacation, it's another to pack up, come all the way here and have no vacation at all. Make that make sense. So it's back to the airport for me. Do you know what time the water taxis start? Look, I... I really hope I don't regret this, but we are both adults. This place is, it's pretty big. It's got two bathrooms. If you can keep to yourself and not bother me, you can stay. But only until something else opens up and I'm not your host, okay? I'm not gonna be your tour guide or anything like that. No, I didn't think that, but thank you. You gonna stay or what? Look, here. All right, whatever you decide, if you decide to head out, just go ahead and lock up and leave the key under the mat, okay? Hey. Don't touch. Sorry. I can't believe I'm doing this, Courtney. I'm staying with a complete stranger. I can't believe a stranger is letting you stay. Well, he seems all right. Little bit familiar, but you know I won't be seeing much of him anyway 'cause now I've got something to do. What do you mean? What do you mean, "what do you mean?" This is a great story. Have Gabby send me everything that she can find on vacation rental scams and run a background check on these Luxury Way people. Boy are they gonna be sorry. I guess it's futile to remind you that you are on vacation. Excuse me, have we met? I have been scammed. I'm not gonna get a pina colada and sit on the beach. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. Of course you are. - See ya. - Bye. What is up with the goat? Okay, how hard can it be? Ooh! Here we go. Wow. Lady, wrong side. Wrong side. Oh. Sorry! Hello again. Could you tell me where the police station is? Oh, hi. I would like to report a crime. - A crime? - Yes. What kind of crime? I was scammed. By who? I don't know. That's why I'm here. Okay. My assistant rented this place for me from Luxury Away. I don't know if they've done that to anyone here before. I mean, does this happen a lot here? No. Mm-hm, mm-hm, and what about this guy? Says his name is Ford. American. Says it's his place. Has it happened there before? No. I would like to get to the bottom of it. Okay. Are you gonna, are you gonna file a report? I'll go back to the station and get that form. I'll be back in 10 to 15. Okay, I will meet you right here. We can do this. - Ford. - Yep? Do you have some lady staying with you? Yep. Is she all right? I have no idea. I should have trusted my gun. Well, you are the one who asked her to stay. Yeah well, she got scammed. I felt bad for her. And here she comes. Hey, what's up? This is your shop? Yeah. It's nice. So about this scam... I know everyone on the island and no one here scammed you. I mean whoever did it is somewhere far, far away across the vast ocean someplace so my advice to you? Let it go. This is Hughes, my friend. Good morning. It's nice to meet you. I take it you're staying? Well yes. Like I said, I'm here to relax. Hmm. Well lucky me. Goodbye. See you later. Mm, potentially linked, you guys. Mr. Ford? Good morning! Hi. Are you Ford's girlfriend? No. Well, can you tell him for tonight three for McPherson, two for Ferguson? Three and two what? He'll know. Have a nice day. Three and two for Ferguson? I don't know. Hey, how's it going? Take down an illegal daiquiri cart? Bootleg sun tan lotion gang? Very funny. I am trying to relax. Good morning lady. Oh hi. You Ford's girlfriend? No. Oh, okay. This bag is from my mom. She said to tell Ford three for Phillips. Bye. Bye. Three... I don't know, this house is getting a lot of traffic. I feel like something's going on here. Maybe I should look further into this Ford guy. I mean, I am staying with him. What? The guy's guilty of having a social life? Look, I am begging you, go find a hammock and a bottle of rosé. It's Jade on the phone. She's relaxing. Why does everyone think this is so funny? I am relaxing. Bye. So you're really embracing the island life, I see. Mm. Mm-hm. You have a list. McPherson, Ferguson, Phillips. Three, two and three. You know, there's a Lo Lo down the street. What's a Lo Lo? Just a local spot. It's like big drum grills, barbecue chicken, curried chicken, grilled prawns. It's delicious, not like that chemical bomb you're eating. My food is delicious. Sure. Big plans? Just meeting friends. Why, you wanna come? Oh, no. I'm okay. Thank you. All right. Well, uh, you enjoy it. Hey. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - No, what are you doing? Oh, well I was looking for the Lo Lo place. Follow me. (Ic) Oh, look what I found. Hey. Hi Jade. Hi. What are those? These are Johnnycakes. Big thing here in this island, you see. Mine are the best. I got the recipe off my great Aunt Eda one evening after she had too much rum punch. Yeah, it's his parents' 40th wedding anniversary. Oh, the numbers were RSVPs. How many people are coming. Right. Oh, amazingly, it's still a surprise. That's the downside of living on a small island. You should join us. Look, I know I said that I wasn't gonna be your tour guide, but, uh, if you really came here to relax then you gotta go full island. Hm? Yes or no? We gotta get this done before night when our guests of honor arrive. Yeah, I'm down. Let's do it. Ooh. Okay. You sure these things work? Not bad, eh? You two, I cannot believe you planned all this. Of course. It's my parents' anniversary. I'm their son. One second Jade. Hm? Put the phone away. Come on, it's time to party. Right. Thank you. - Yeah? - Yes. Great. Good evening. I wanted to apologize for not properly introducing myself. I'm Jade Taylor. Ah, yes. Our new guest. How's the crime fighting going? I'm Hibbert. This is Miss Maris. Enjoying all that rosé and frozen food? Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Nice to meet you. Jade, there's someone I want you to meet. - Excuse me. - Sure. This is Ingrid, my fiance. Nice to meet you, Jade. You as well. Ingrid manages the spa on the island. The best spa on the island. The only spa on the island. Here they come. Surprise! Oh my. Ladies and gentlemen, the happy couple. 40 years. Let's have a few words. Thank you. We had no idea. My son, the notary, he makes us so proud. And look, he's done so again. So thank you all for coming. Thank you. Well, one day, many years ago, whilst I was working at my father's restaurant, the most beautiful woman entered with her family and we have built a beautiful life together. Come, my love, say something. Giving this one a chance was the best thing that I ever did. My son. And Ford. Thank you. Everyone, please, enjoy yourself. Now... Let's lime. Come. Let's dance. Oh. ♪ If you stumble, if you stumble, if you stumble ♪ ♪ Try to lift your mind from hesitation ♪ ♪ You rise it, you rise it, you rise ♪ ♪ Gotta keep your good reputation ♪ ♪ If you stumble, if you stumble, if you stumble ♪ ♪ Try to lift your mind from hesitation ♪ ♪ Keep your feet in the right direction ♪ ♪ Feed your spirit ♪ Morning. I made breakfast if you wanna join. Oh, morning. Only one condition, your phone is not invited. Oh, I'm just finishing up... - Work stuff. - Work stuff. Yeah. It smells nice. So, Ford, tell me something about yourself. Uh, there's not really much to tell. Just out here living my best island life. You're from the states. Where? What were you doing before this? Why all the questions? I'm just trying to get to know you. You gotta give me something. Come on. All right, fine. I'm from Jersey. Jersey? Interesting. Where's your accent? What accent? Yo, Vinny, where's my pork roll? First of all, it's Taylor Ham and I don't know anyone who speaks like that, so... Okay. Where'd you go to college? Oh. More questions. Sorry. It's in my nature. I'm a news producer. Really? Now you seem surprised. No. No, I'm not. It actually makes perfect sense. Hello? Jane? We're up top, Ingrid. Good morning. Hey. You ready? Ready for what? Ford told us what happened with the rental scam. That is no way to start a vacation, you see, so we are giving you a do-over. A spa day, on us. No. That's amazing. Really? Yes. Go. Go, have fun. Oh my gosh. Thank you. Ingrid, this is stunning. Thank you. Vacation reboot starts now. I like the way you think. Oh. Sorry. So how long have you and Hughes been together? We've known each other since we were kids, but then he went off to boarding school, you see, so we reconnected when he came home for summers. Got engaged when he came home from university. He's a good one, Hughes. Yeah. His father mentioned he's a notary? What is that here? Here? It's prestigious. It's like being a lawyer. Wow. And his father is very proud. Yeah. I got that. Unfortunately it's, it's not what Hughes wants. You saw him cooking last night, right? Yes. It was delicious. I know. He's so talented. He wants to take over the family beach restaurant. Just, after all that education, he can't disappoint his parents. Hm. I feel so lucky. I wake up every morning excited to go to work, and love what I do, so I feel for him. So do I. But things like that don't matter to Pops Hughes. So, what do you think of Ford? Uh, I barely know him. Why? Why? Because he's a catch. The man is kind and easy on the eyes and so forth. Have you not noticed? I didn't really come to the island looking for love. I just went through a breakup and I was thrown off when I met him. I thought I was getting robbed. I was holding a lamp above my head, ready to take this swing at him. He's a tough one, though. But so great and so handsome. But so very private. What? Notice now? Come on, sit. Relax. I'm gonna go help mum with today's produce delivery. Okay. Talk about burying the lead. Anyone care for some fresh ceviche and a cold beer? Uh, I'm okay, thanks. I've got some things I need to get done. What about you, Ford? You around later? Yeah. Yeah. Why? I have a surprise for you. It's a, a thank you surprise. Hm. A surprise. Don't. Good afternoon, Miss Maris. Hey. You hungry? I'm cooking. You cook? Yes, of course I cook. That's insulting. I'm from Louisiana. I just never really have time to slow down and do it right, that's all. Well, I mean, I thought you were from New York. I mean, where's your accent? Oh, I lost it. I moved to New York right after I graduated college. I couldn't wait to get there. You literally have no accent. Can't tell. I took diction classes. All I cared about was being Christiane Amanpour. I never made it on air myself, but I got there as fast as I could, threw myself into it and I'm like a native now. Hm. What are you cooking? Jambalaya. You wanna help? ♪ Oh yeah ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ Taste? Good. Could use a little more. - Oh? - Mm-hm. Keep it coming. Come on. Oh, okay. I ain't scared of a little spice. All right. Let's see if you can take the heat... Or get out of the kitchen. Is that too much for you? Bay-bay. Yeah? Now that's good. - Okay. - Mm-hm. We're spicy simpatico, then. Mm-hm, I believe I'm a little Louisiana now. My ex thought Tabasco sauce was strong. Yes, my ex was a punk. So, tell me about this spice deficient ex of yours. Oh, I don't wanna bore you with my love life or lack thereof. Oh, okay, so you get to ask the questions, but you don't have to answer 'em? Fair enough. He claimed that I put work before our relationship, which is not true. It's a little bit true, but he wasn't the one and my life is very fast paced and... You wouldn't understand. I mean, your island in life is the exact opposite of my New York life. Actually, I do. I do understand. You actually remind me of someone I used to know. Gotta post a few vacation photos. Are you on social media? No. Facebook? Twitter? Nothing? Nope, nope, nope. Hm. Just like my privacy, mm. I get that. One question, and one question only. Go ahead, ask. Have you ever been in love? Yeah, I had a fiance once. Three years ago. What happened? I said one question. It's a follow up question. Listen, um there's a big celebration tomorrow at the yacht club. Would you like to, you know, maybe be my... Your? My plus one? Mm? It's gonna be a special celebration. Team Hughes won the Annual Sailing Race last year, three peat, so. You're a sailor? Ah, just part of a team. The winner of the final gets to keep the Cup until the start of the new racing season, so this is like our farewell celebration for that. It's kind of a big deal. Big deal? Oh, yeah. Love to be your plus one. Cool. Hey, sailor? Yes? What's the attire for this thing? Island formal. Got it. Island formal. I'll meet you at the cart in 30. Wow. Okay, what? Nothing. Nothing, you just clean up really nice, that's all. For a second there, I... I can't place it. I thought you looked familiar, but... Well, you probably recognize me from, you know, my days as a former GQ model. Right. Okay, okay, it wasn't that funny. Ford! Jade. Have fun. I'll catch up with you later. Hey. Remember earlier when I said wow? I meant it. Oh! Hey! - You all right? - Man. Hey. Hey, come on, man, hey. Hey. How are you? Don't. I wasn't going to say anything. Not a thing. What's up? Who's that? Two execs from a chain restaurant. And Pop's putting on a dog and pony show. They don't belong here. They're not part of this celebration. You know, once he makes this deal, there's no going back, right? Yeah. And he's gonna make a whole lot of money off this deal. He can retire rich and proud his son's a notary. Oh. I'll just be a second. Excuse me. Hello? Hey, you're on speaker. I'm with Gabby. Hi Jade. We just wanted to check in with you. You know, I've done a lot of digging and your vacation rental scam thing could actually be a bigger story. Oh. Okay, cool. That could just be the story that I need. But no rush. We can flush it out when I get back. Well look at you. Yes, and check this out. How's that for having fun in the sun, hm? Oh, and can you check him out for me? He seems a little familiar or something. I just can't place it. I knew you couldn't help yourself. Okay you two, I'll talk to you later. I'm officially turning off my phone for the night. Bye. I'm sorry. Did that just happen? Yes. What's up? Oh, nothing. We were on the phone with Jade. How lovely. Let me remind you, she's on vacation, you two aren't. Let's go.

I love you, Hughes, which means I want a happy and proud husband. Being a notary makes your father happy, but does it truly make you happy? I'm proud of you no matter what you do, as long as you do the right thing for your heart. Hey, hey, you guys. Hello? Come on you two. Come on, let's dance. What are you doing? Aye. Oh, please, please don't. She's right. He does look familiar. Wait a minute. Gabby. Can you bring me the file? You know the one on the New Jersey DA scandal? Thanks. Hey, what's up? Right there. Lose the beard and it's him. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Malcolm Elliot Jr.? (Dr) "I am officially inviting you on a date." Please spend the day with me. P.S., your phone is not invited. "Ford." Of course. All right. Please tell me something has changed from last night. I didn't sleep at all. I spent it researching Malcolm Elliot Jr. Right after the case blew up, he just disappeared. There was no sign of him anywhere. Look at this. Has to be the same guy. Well, here's a call I don't want to make. Jerk chicken, spicy. Oh, make that two. Extra spicy. Mm. Okay. I'll bring it right now. Thank you. First concert? Nas with my older brother. Yours? BSB with my younger sister. Really owe her a phone call. Wait, I'm sorry. What's BSB? Backstreet Boys. You gotta be kidding me. What? Well, I just, no, I never thought you'd be so corny. Okay, I am not corny. Were there any other Black people where you grew up? BSB has a very diverse audience, thank you very much. And "I Want It That Way" is a brilliant pop song. Pop songs are underrated. People will be listening to them for years to come, like Beethoven. Are you kidding me? Wow, I, yeah, I was with you until Beethoven. So what was your life like before you moved here? It was, um... It was busy. Too busy to realize what really mattered. That's why I'm always on you about the phone, you know? It creates a barrier, a distraction. Makes it hard to be present. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. It's just, it's how things are done. That's how life is right now. You can't turn it off. You slow down, you're done. No, I don't think so. I think we have a choice. Is that why you moved here? Was that a choice? It's one of the reasons, yeah. I can just be, here. I get it. I understand, 'cause I'm always just going, going, going, and maybe I do... Nevermind. So is this it for you? Just beaches, sunsets. Island life forever. First of all, that's a terrible accent. But no, not exactly. I have a business here. And here we go. Ooh-wee. Hope you keep your water full. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the jerk has arrived. Right. Who needs water? We got this. It's delicious. Not spicy enough. Ooh. Is that the goat from outside of your house? Mm-hm, sure is. She wanders around town now and then. Miss Edith adopted her, but she hangs out with all of us. This is Shirley. Three time Miss Maceo Island pageant winner. Wait, wait, what am I hearing? There's actually a goat beauty pageant? Yep, every year. It is an island tradition. Hence the photo and the sash. This is good. Yeah, it's this very, very serious event. Oh. - Mm-hm. - Sorry. Just not a fan of beauty pageants. My sister Janelle was a beauty pageant queen. We're very different. Well you know, that's the thing about family. You know, sometimes they can work your last nerve, but so what, you know? And like you said, you're different. You can't leave 'em in the past. After all, they're the ones who will always have your back. That's right. Even if she tells me that my job doesn't matter because I'm behind the camera. - Hey man. - Hey. Afternoon, Jade. Hello, Hughes. What you doing out the office, man? Oh, heading back to the restaurant to help my mom with some bookkeeping. Oh, you're such a good son. Well, even though someone told me to leave my phone behind, don't think I'm not getting a photo with the pageant queen over here. - Yes you are. - Would you mind? Come on, Ford. Get it on this. Me? No. Get lower, get lower. Get lower. Got you, get in there. Come on, get in there. Get in there. It's only for Shirley, okay? For Shirley. Hey Shirley. Oh my God, okay. God, please, don't bite the watch. Don't much on the watch. Bad, bad goat. My God, my dad gave me this as a graduation gift from law school. Come on. Have a great time, kids. Yep. You, um, you went to law school? Yeah, yeah I've done a lot of things, but I'm here now and I like it, so yeah. Come on, let's take a little walk on the beach, huh? Hm? What a perfect day. I used to take walks like this on my grandpa's crawfish farm. You know if there's anything I regret, it's not going home more often. I have to admit, I enjoyed not having my phone today. Thank you. It was liberating and I feel like I got to know you more. So tell me, your perfect island life, do you ever see anything more or? Well, the thing is, if you had asked me that when I first got here, the answer would've been a hard no. But now... Hey Ford. Another tourist drove a golf cart into the pond. You gotta come and fish it out. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'll be right there. Duty calls. Be back in a few hours. Hey. What is going on? The one at the New Jersey DA's office? The one that you referred to in the interview with the Congresswoman? I remember the broad strokes. Why? Well you were right. He is familiar. I'm about to send you a photo. Seriously? This is happening? Tabitha put me on a leave of absence. Oh, I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to, but you, my dear, are in the middle of a story. Come again? I'm not kidding. Ha ha. What? What is this I'm looking at? The guy standing behind former DA George Clayton? In the middle, with the beard? ADA Malcolm Elliot, Jr. This is a huge story. He tried the case and it was a slam dunk that ended in a mistrial. It never got retried and he's the only one whose side of the scandal has never been heard. He literally disappeared. All right, well, my guy's name is Ford. People have doppelgangers. It just really looks like him. He took the fall for the mistrial. Some people say he was bribed. No wonder he's hiding out on a tiny island. Okay, we don't know that this is Ford. But we need verification, stat. Well, it gets worse. Rumor has it Clayton, Malcolm Elliot's old boss, is about to announce he's running for governor. Great. Thanks for tasting this with me. I'm gonna pitch it my folks as a new appetizer menu item. I need a second opinion. Of course my friend, I will take free, delicious snacks anytime, any day. So, you and Jade. Talk to me. I was watching you both last night, and? And now you just spent the day together. Ford, and she's a news producer from New York. Look, I know, man. I just... I like her. I can't help it. It's a bit risky, in my opinion, for a fling. You know, I really wish it was just a fling. You know, a fling, it's light, it's breezy. She is far too complicated for a fling. Well, if you wanna start something new, you're gonna have to tell her the truth. I'm working on it, okay? Okay. Okay, okay, okay, man, that is good. Your dad is gonna love this. M. Ford? What am I doing? Malcolm Elliot Jr. And Brooke Davis. Son of Malcolm Elliot, Sr. and Allison Ford. "Great day, went to bed. See you tomorrow." Hey, ready to go? Uh, I'm sorry. Wait, go where? Waterside picnic. Uh, private island. I got some hookups. Thought you might enjoy the scenery and, you know, a boat ride. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds great. I'll just be a minute. What's up? You're usually a bit more talkative. Just thinking. About what? Now who's the one doing the interviewing? Just thinking about the fact that I'm leaving soon. Not sure that I want to. Are you serious? You're not itching to get back to work? Honestly, no. But you can't hide from real life forever, right? I'll see you downstairs in 10? This has got to be the most beautiful place I've ever seen. Oh, it's gonna get better. Just come. Better? Mm-hm. Yeah, just follow me. Wow, you were not lying when you said you had the hookup. And rosé. It's your favorite. My favorite. Ford... There's a lot of reasons I don't wanna go back to New York. I need to tell you something. I know. I have feelings for you, too. Look, there's something I have to tell you, too. But I need to know that I can trust you. Seriously? Come on, you're a news producer who told me that she puts her job before relationships. Oh, that. Mm-hm. Fair enough. Look, um... I was a version of you. Very passionate about my job, worked long hours, but I, um... I trusted my mentor and everything came crashing down. Ford. I know. It's okay. Wait, what do you mean you know? It's nice to meet you, Malcolm Elliot, Jr. You knew? What, you come down here looking for me? Like? What? No. No, no, I sent some vacation photos to my coworkers. One of 'em recognized you- Your coworkers who are news producers? Right. Ford, hey. Hey, it's me. Look, so what, you didn't have them check up on me? Hm? You mean to tell me you weren't snooping around about me? Wow, this is exactly what I was afraid of. Wait, so you're not gonna talk anymore? What? I actually thought that I could trust you. I need to get back to the shop. This, this was a mistake. You were so secretive. And I, I thought for a minute that I recognized you, but I... George Clayton, district attorney of New Jersey, my mentor, my friend, he took a bribe. He leaked information that led to a mistrial in a money laundering case. I had no idea it was him until he told me I couldn't retry the case. Pieced a few things together and the bad guys walked. The whole thing looked shady and it was my case. I lost faith in institutions and people that I believed in, including my fiance who walked the second things got ugly. I mean, she barely even wanted to hear my side of the story, much less stick around and bear with me through it. You can't just pretend that a part of your life never happened. Why not finally tell your story? I can help you. You're asking me for an interview just like that? Just off the bat? What if my life gets blown up for a second time? No, I... No. I'm not saying that you have to do it. I'm just saying that. I think you should. I mean, at least just think about it, because what are you, what are you really doing here? Are you living or are you just hiding out? Ford, not all stories and the way you imagine it. I... I can't do this right now, okay? I'm gonna spend the night at Hughes's house. What's going on with Ford? I know he stayed with Hughes last night. I found out by accident about his past. I had to tell him that I knew and then when we talked, I think I just, I pushed him too far. I should have just left it or listened. Are you telling me this as someone who wants to be with Ford? Or are you telling me this as a news producer who wants her story? Both, I guess. When I met Ford, I had no idea who he was, and then... Then I started to like him. And now... And now? I was just opening up to her, you know? Finally, just someone, letting her in. And then the next thing you know, she's telling me, she already knows and I should go public. But I don't know if I'm ready for all that. Well I hear you, but maybe it's time. Look, not everyone's gonna believe me. I don't want my life to turn into a circus all over again. Sometimes you just have to face the things you don't want to. Look who's talking. It's a completely different situation. Yeah, right. You have no idea the pressure I feel. And not just my dad, from the whole island. What? Dude, you're like the mayor. The whole island loves you, man, whatever you do. I'm here. You have anything you wanna tell me? Nothing concrete, still looking for confirmation. So you really like this guy, then? I just need some more time. This is news, big news, and you know if the situation were reversed, you'd be saying the same thing to me. I love you, but I can only hold off on this for so long. Look, I gotta go. Malcolm Elliot Jr.? Good afternoon. Afternoon. We're looking for a gentleman named Malcolm Elliot Jr. By any chance would you know where we could find him? Never heard of him. Ah, I believe he goes by the name of Ford on the island. Hm. Is he a very short man? Uh no, no, actually I think he's pretty tall. Does he have a mustache? I don't know. He could. Now, is he the one with the three little dogs? I dunno. Well, I don't know him, then. Thanks for your time. Come on. Two nosy men here looking for Ford. Ford here. Yeah, Ford. Hibbert. I just wanna give you a heads up. How's that? Two guys just arrived on the island. They were asking around where to find you. Some reporter type and a camera guy. Thanks, Hibbert. Yeah, no worries. So there's a cameraman and reporter who just water taxied in looking for me. Wait, what? What are you talking about? You think it just magically happened out nowhere? Ford, where are you going? Just leave the keys under the mat before you go. Courtney, how could you do this? You completely blindsided me. Hold on. What are you talking about? A news reporter and a cameraman just arrived at the island. What? I can't believe you did this. You didn't even warn me. I didn't, I wouldn't. I... Hold on. Tabitha? Why did a cameraman and a reporter just show up on Jade's vacation? Because she's slipping. Oh, come on. Are you kidding me? Ted was already in Miami covering a story. I sent him and a cameraman over first thing. I can't believe you didn't tell me. I can't believe you were sitting on this. But listen, his former boss is about to run for governor and no one's heard this guy's side of the story. It was a mistrial and the case was never retried. Why? That's news. People need to know what happened. We still need the story, Jade. Well, you'll have to get it without me. But... Hi. Hi. I was going to leave this at the house for Ford, but I'm not sure when he's coming back. So would you mind giving it to him for me? Of course. And I'm sorry that you're leaving. Me too. Janelle. Hey. Hey. I just, I just wanted to say that I know how I am and we don't always see eye to eye and I don't come home often enough, but, it's times like these that I'm happy to have a sister to talk to. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm just coming home for my trip earlier than I thought. Oh, I have so much to tell you. I don't even know where to start. What? Do you really think? Se sold you out? Dude, a cameraman and a reporter magically show up on the island. You think this is a coincidence? Maybe it wasn't intentional. Maybe it was. This is my life here. I've worked really hard to build it. You're an attorney who runs a bike and cart shop. And I like it. In all the years I've known you, I've never seen you connect with someone like this. You're just gonna let her go? She left this for you. Dear Ford, I'm sorry about how things ended. I didn't arrange it. Just know your story is yours to tell and in your own time. I thought you should know, though, Clayton is announcing his run for governor tonight. I just wish we could have had more time together. Jade. Jade left. Her job sent a reporter looking for Ford. She said she didn't arrange it. You don't believe her? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I believe her. Then as far as I can see, you have been given the chance to finally set your path straight and have a chance of a future with a really lovely woman. So what are you waiting for? And as for you... Don't think I don't know what's going on with you. It's time you had a talk with your father. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. Goodbye. Ford? Hey, look, I changed my mind. I'm doing the interview because it's time, and I want to. Okay, but I have one condition. It has to be with you. I thought you'd never ask. So it's a yes? It's a yes. Are you sure? Yes. Let's do this. "South side of the island, 21 Zephyr Lane. And Jade Taylor says to step on it." Thank you. Come on. I know everything you did for me was out of love. I remember the day we put the plaque out on my office door. You were so proud. I was. I'm proud of this restaurant, too. What you've created. The history. And I love cooking. I appreciate everything you sacrificed for me more than you know, but I don't want you to sell this place. I wanna take it over. Can you still be a notary at the weekend? Thanks, dad. Yes, yes, Courtney. I've got him. He's ready. Are you sure? Very sure. Okay, Jade. Knock 'em out in three... Thank you for sitting down with me today, Mr. Elliot. It's Malcolm, please. I just wanna set the record straight. Four years ago, you were the lead attorney on the McAllister money laundering case, a case with clear cut evidence and yet it ended in a mistrial. Please, tell us your side of the story. My friend, my mentor, DA George Clayton, the man who was going to officiate my wedding, suddenly wouldn't allow me to retry the case. I held my tongue. I was stuck. And why did you decide to come forward now? Is it because you heard that your former boss, George Clayton, has announced that he's running for governor? No, I had no idea he was running until just now. Why am I taking this interview? Well, when you decide you wanna move forward with your life, that you want to start a new chapter, the best chance of being successful at that is to let go of your past, and I'm ready to do that. DA George Clayton took the bribe and then he leaked the documents. I had no idea until after the case was declared a mistrial. The McAllister's walked. Malcolm, thank you for your time. That is a wrap right there. That's a scoop. And all while she was on vacation. ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ - See it. - Wait, really? Yeah. It's a birthmark, though. - You know what? - Hm? Technically I still have two weeks of vacation time left. Hm, that is music to my ears. So... What happens after that? Trip back to Jersey to visit my family. Really? Mm-hm. Well, if you're interested, my mother is having a not turning 60 party. You should swing by on your way. I just so happen to love not turning 60 parties. You know, I was thinking after Jersey, it's been a while since I crossed the river into the city. Might be a great place for me to look into some pro bono law work. Plus, there's this woman. - Really? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. She actually lives there. You know, funny story. I found her sleeping in my house on Maceo Island one night. She thought it was a vacation rental. Crazy.
