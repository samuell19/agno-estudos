Yeah. -Woo! -Jimmy Giuffre, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim Hall. My fellow Rhode Islanders, I am here at the annual jazz festival, and I've just spoken here a few words. On my way down here, though, a fact that I want to stress to my fellow citizens in Rhode Island generally, I was impressed with the traffic on our roads, and it's going to be increasing for the holiday, the 4th, and the days before and after. And I do hope that everyone who drives a car will seriously remind himself or herself, as the case may be, that they must take extra precautions. We don't want their own enjoyment as well as that of the rest of their fellow citizens to be endangered by accidents which are likely to occur on any holiday season. Thank you very much. That all right? Read it? I haven't read it since... Vaughan, Vaughan 4D. This stock arrangement is a hundred years old. Hello, hello. -Where are you from, please? -I'm from East Jesus. Uh-huh, and why'd you come here? I came here, you know, I just came here for the fun of it. Actually, excuse me. Let me ask you this, are you a jazz fan? -Yeah, actually. -Uh-huh. Do you have any particular favorites? Yeah, Gerry Mulligan is my favorite. -How about you, dear? -I don't have any favorites. You don't have any favorites at all? -What do you have? -I don't really like jazz! You don't? What did you come here for? This man wants to know. -For the ride. -The ride? It's your car. Okay, thank you! Henry Grimes and Roy Haynes remain on stage to accompany one of the complete originals of music, a man who lives his music, a man who thinks his music, and it's possible to say that he lives and thinks of little else. We can't describe him exactly as "daring" because I think he is unconcerned with any opposition to his music. He concerns himself with such elements as the quarter tone which he doesn't find in our Western scale, so... ...he'll strike two adjoining notes on the piano, two adjoining keys to imply the missing note that's in between. Ladies and gentlemen, Thelonious Monk. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Alan Young speaking to you live from the bridge of the United States destroyer William R. Rush. They're located nine miles south-southeast of Brenton Reef Lightship off Newport. The starting line is just a few hundred yards windward of us here. The third race is just about to get underway. The weather out here is sunny with a smoky haze on the horizon. The wind is now blowing a lively 23 miles an hour. Just a half an hour ago, they clocked it at 18 miles an hour. It seems to be increasing all the time, so it should be a terrific race today. Da-dum, da-dum, da-dumpity, dumpity-dum, da-dum, da-dum One, two, three, four. Tenor sax, Sonny Stitt.

What do they say, "The joint is really jumping"? I think that's kind of pass√© by now. We have found a very lovely lady here, and I think that she is the one person who is really responsible for this jazz festival and it's Elaine Lorillard. -How are you tonight, Elaine? -Very well, thank you. Are you pleased with what you see tonight? -I'm very happy. -You know, actually, I think we're very fortunate.

Now with emotion, technique, precision, and imagination the music of The Chico Hamilton Quintet, Chico Hamilton. Louis do you ever run into any language problems in your travels around the world? No, no, I'm the pointiest cat you ever seen in your life. I was at an Italian trumpet player's house, and his mother was a Countess While they were fixing the spaghetti we was wailing, you know, and in this big old dining room, they had this big table and up in the ceiling they had Marc Anthony and Cleo and all them cats in there painted. Looking down on ya as if to say,"Man, you sure could eat." We have a lot of fun traveling, man. Oh, oh, oh, Robert Gordan he's the big jazz fan in Brussels, you know, big lawyer and when I opened up at the Palladium, the first time, you know, he came and spent those days in rehearsal and after rehearsal we'd take walk around Charing Square somewhere, you know, getting the feel of London. So I figure he's over there he can tell them how much I weigh I had one of them big pennies, you know. Them scales, they don't saylike I was hundred and something like that, they say stones. 160 pounds that's about 12 stones or something like that, but I figured our friend could dig it. I said, "You tell me, I'll put the penny in there." He said, "Yeah, yeah yeah." I got up there, I dropped the penny, damn I say, "Tell me." He says, "I don't know." Oh, man, them laughs kill you over there. I had audience with the Pope too, you know. He's a fine little fella, you know. He was tickled to death to know that Italian people enjoyed about music and he speak on in his subject in all kinds of languages, you know. So he, he's all right, man. He asked me, "You got any children?" You know, I say well, "No, Daddy, but we still wailing" He said... He said, "But I'm gonna pray for you, I'm gonna pray for you." Louis, the city is yours.
