June 29th. 25 degrees. I will take notes everyday... I'm very smart, and I study very hard. I'm sure I'll be someone great in the future. Are onee-San"s breasts and my mother's different? Unable to reproduce the shape with bowls. I'm still in the 4th grade, but I already know onee-San a study of the geometry of breasts as much as some adults. Everyday, I learn about the world. I become a better person. Brother, time to eat! - Eat up. - I ran a calculation today... I figured out that it'll be another 3,888 days until I become an adult. You're not going to eat? I can't imagine just how amazing I'll be when that day comes. I might be too amazing for my own good. - I'm leaving! - See you later! Brother, I'm leaving already. See you later. I'm sure that lots of girls will want to marry me. But there's already someone I have in mind. So the others will just have to live with it. I feel bad for everyone else, but this has already been decided. There's something over there! What is it? - They're crows, I bet. - No, they're not! I can't tell from here. Let's go take a look! Yeah! Hey, wait! There's like ten of them! - Hey! - Aoyamal! Did you hear about the penguins? So there really were penguins in that field! - No way. - There totally were. I've only seen them in the zoo. Penguins live in Antarctica and the islands nearby. That's what I read in a book. They don't live in the suburbs. Why were those penguins in that field? Were they even real penguins? And where did they even come from, anyway? I need to investigate this incident. Aoyama. What do you think about the penguins, aoyama? I have six different hypotheses on why they've appeared here. The first is that they escaped from a zoo vehicle. The second is that they're abandoned pets. The third is that they're crows that have undergone a sudden mutation to become fat. Uchida and I have formed an expedition team. Project Amazon right now, we're identifying the source of this river. We call this research project Amazon. Let's see if there's any penguins on the way back. I can't. I'm going to the dentist after school today. Does tomorrow work? Sure. You're all little kids. Who cares about some penguins? I've seen tons of them at the zoo. But they were in a field! Shut up! Suzuki is the most arrogant guy in the class. The males under his control are completely loyal to him. I don't care about any penguins. Aoyama, what's so fun about writing all that up? We don't think that penguins in and of themselves are abnormal. We think it's strange that penguins have appeared in the suburbs. What? If you saw them, you'd probably think it was weird, too. I did see them! What's wrong with you? Get out of here. Uchida. What's with him? You're not interested at all? What do you want? I don't care at all. The theory of relativity that book... Did you read it, aoyama? Yeah. I was interested in black holes, but the book was a bit difficult. Same here. Pretty difficult stuff. Hmm? I see. Penguins are cute. Penguins are boring. Hamamoto is extremely smart and good at chess. She might be even more amazing than I am. As you can tell, I'm not conceited, and that makes me great. I'm out! That's enough! Hello. Thank you. No problem. Suzuki. What do you want? You have that disease, as well? I can tell by looking at you. What disease? You don't know? It's called stanislaw's syndrome. It's a terrifying disease where all your teeth have to be pulled. I've never heard of that. My mom only said I was getting my wisdom teeth out... A mother wouldn't tell their kid they're getting all their teeth pulled. Too scary. Slowly but surely, all your teeth will be pulled. That's what happened to me. But I think you have a right to know what's going to happen to you. Seriously? The only way to stop the spread of the disease is to pull all of your teeth. If you don't, the bacteria will spread, and your face will swell up. These mushroom-looking things will start growing from the cracks in your teeth. And after much pain, you'll die. Suzuki! In order to prevent that from happening, the dentist will put you under, and slowly remove your teeth. But it's okay. You'll only be in pain for a month. Suzuki, please. Do I have this "Stan" thing? What? You don't have to pull my teeth if I brush properly, right? We're not pulling all of your teeth. You're lying! You're trying to trick me! Young man. Why did you say that to suzuki? Don't you feel bad for him? I feel bad for uchida. Who's uchida? This is not your problem. You don't need to know. You baby. Guess you learned how to dodge questions. Silly brat. This lady is a woman who I've gotten to know here at the dentist. Hey there. Sorry, I'm teaching this kid a lesson. I might have done something a little immature. Well, you're still a kid. Suzuki was being mean to uchida. But uchida didn't really ask me to get him back. So, I don't really have the right to punish suzuki for what he did to uchida. I should have talked to uchida first, at the bare minimum. You've sure got a lot going on. Oh, look at this. Penguins are mysterious, aren't they? Who knows what's going on with them? Do you know about what happened this morning? I heard. Even more mysterious, huh? I love penguins. All right. I'm going to take this. This looks a bit like you. Small, but still full of himself. Research lab anhy number of stories. But how much do you really know about the voyagers? The adélie penguin. Scientific name: Pygoscelis adeliae. This is the path that penguins take when they come back from the ocean. The penguin highway... Penguin highway Good name. They really took me by surprise. I didn't think one of them would come running out. I couldn't believe it. Young man, look at the chess board. I am. You keep looking at my boobs. Il am not. You're not looking. You're looking at something else. Yes, I am. And no I'm not. I worry about your future. They come from the south pole, but they can somehow survive here. What if they were being transported somewhere and escaped? Wouldn't we have heard something from a zoo or a pet store? The mystery deepens. So what have you deduced? There's still not enough information. I think aliens brought them here. Why do you think that? They're invading. Penguins are cute, you see? The aliens are counting on that, and when everyone lets their guard down... They're going to take over the un headquarters. I see. Makes sense, logically. You're teasing me, aren't you? Don't make me take your teeth out. Anyway, that's enough for today. You're tired, aren't you? I'm fine. Just tell the truth. - Welcome. - Good evening. It's time to go home. Sorry for being so late. Not too much trouble, I hope. No, I'm having a great time. Aoyama is a smart kid. I guess I'm smart. It's good you like your research, but how about brushing your teeth from now on? I just totally forgot. I'm rather busy. It's true you do a lot, but... Say there's a busy person that brushes their teeth, and one that doesn't. Which one would you consider smarter? Well, in that case, I would have to say the one that brushes their teeth. See you later! =I'll be back. See you. I wanna help! Go ahead! Aoyama! Penguin locations they're not here. Field not here. Yoshida's house not here, either. Central park I can't find any penguins. Is that a penguin? Oh, it's just a cat. Those are boob cakes. Are they really called that? Guess we'll just have to switch to project Amazon. Who knew this was behind the school? We've traveled pretty far. This canal might go all the way to the edge of the world. The edge of the world? Yeah. Does that mean the water falls off the end? I don't think that's really what's going on. But it'd be cool if it was. Yeah, the earth is round. That means there's no "edge". Yes, which means that the actual "edge" of the world... Would be where the air reaches space. I wonder if we're almost to the source of the stream. Yeah. I think that boobs are mysterious. I keep thinking of onee-San's boobs. Her boobs aren't the same as my mom's. They're the same category of object, but the feeling they give me... I wonder why they affect me so differently. What do you think, uchida? I don't know, man... 22, 23, 24, 25... 26, 27, 28, 29, 30! There's too many to count! This is amazing, aoyama! This must be a penguin highway. Their rookery should be up ahead. We've lost them. I wonder if we went the wrong way. The penguins' rookery might be beyond this forest. Wait, aoyama! The silver moon appears deep in this forest, right? That's just a rumor. Yeah, but... They say that if you see the silver moon you'll get sick. There's no evidence for that. It's fine. Let's go. This 1s all weird. I've never seen anything like this. This is getting kind of scary... Hey there! You liar! You liar! What lie? You said all that weird stuff at the dentist, right? Oh, you mean when you started crying? Stop it with your lies! I'm going to punish you. Both of you. No, we're busy. Hey, you! Sorry! Darn it! Get them! Wait up! Hey! I feel the need to say this, but I feel bad about what happened. I'm sorry. Shut up! That's what you get. Yeah, what you get. What are you doing, young man? Pretending to be a vending machine. I'll take a cola, then. That'll be 120 yen. Here you are. Can't get this open. Not a very good vending machine, are we? Looks like I'm going to have to go home. Please help me. No need to be so cocky. You could have just said so. That sucks. Though it's your fault that you lied to suzuki, too. If you were there this whole time, you could have helped. I make it a point not to interfere in childish squabbles. What were you doing? I wanted to take a bus, but I was tired and fell asleep. Happens sometimes. Want me to pull that out? I'm fine. I'll get it out myself. I'll do it nice for ya. It'll be an experiment. I see. I like experiments. Let's see... Stay nice and still... Now, young man. I'll pull this string, and we'll see if your tooth comes out. Okay... Hey! I'm not scared. My body's moving on its own. I know. I have a good idea. Watch closely. There we go! I thought there was no way that this would get my tooth out, but... Here you go. What's that? A penguin. Here you go. It's out. I'm pretty mysterious myself, huh? Try solving this mystery. Do you think you can? Brother, wake up! Wake up! Hey! Let me out! Boo! You're like an old man without his teeth! Let me out, brother! Let me out, brother! Onee-San took out my baby tooth. Dad! I have witnessed a surprising phenomenon, but I have no hard evidence. I cannot report it as of yet. Could you give me a hint? The lady from the dentist. She's rather mysterious and fascinating! I see. You've found yourself a wonderful subject. Here's your usual reward. Dad, could I have some coffee? If you must. It's bitter. Requires more experimentation! Hey, aoyama! Let's have fun again sometime! Sorry, I'm extremely busy. Well... I'm not really sure, myself. Really? Yeah, it's a mystery to me, as well. But you might be able to solve this. How about we give it a shot? Okay! Let's do this. What's this? Samples for experimentation. Pretty well thought out, huh? I guess that's why you're a little scientist. Now, please toss them. I'll start with this jar. Here we go! Nothing happened. Yes... Next. Next. Frying pan, baseball tin, glasses case what do you think? Let's try replicating the conditions from yesterday. I'm tired. Let's call it a day. No, we keep experimenting. I don't think we're going to see anything today. When do you tend to get penguins? Please give me something. Well... I start to feel good, like I can't contain it, and then I get a penguin. I just toss something. You really can't bring out a penguin? Are you messing with me? You do this on your own, then. I'm sorry. I was being immature. You're just a kid, so it's fine. I'll be an adult in 3,831 days. You've got to be kidding me. You calculated that? Dad's 3 steps to solving a problem: Break your problem into smaller pieces. View your problem from different angles. Search for similar problems. Why do the penguins head towards the forest? Why does onee-San create them? Penguin highway sorry I ran away and left you behind. It's fine. Sorry I couldn't save the map. Let's do better next time. You don't get mad, do you? Just think about boobs if you think you're going to get angry. You'll feel extremely calm instead. I don't think that's a good thing to think about. Well, it's not the only thing on my mind. Probably only about thirty minutes a day. Uchida, you wanted to show me something? Yeah. Penta! Oh, it's a penguin. This is penta. I found him in my apartment's parking garage, and hid him here. Surprise no one has found him. He hides when people come. That's a rather smart penguin. Well, he hasn't been eating food at all. He's really not eating anything at all? I give him fish, ham, cucumbers, rice balls... He won't eat anything. Eat up. You're not hungry? There you go. The penguins that onee-San creates can survive without eating anything. They run on some unknown energy source. E = penguin energy we'll take you somewhere nice, so sit still in there for now. I love the aquarium. It'll be fun. Yeah. Hopefully we'll find some food he can eat. Yeah. Aoyama, what was... Right. Penta! Maybe he gets motion sickness. Let's get off at the next station. Kadoichimatsu. Kadoichimatsu. He was fine just a while ago. Something's happening. I'm going to open this, uchida. Okay. Penta! Penta! Penta! Uchida! Penta... Here's my deductions thus far... E = penguin energy penguins run on some sort of unknown energy source. The penguins onee-San creates must be getting energy from somewhere else. I've named this penguin energy. The penguin was able to live without eating anything, but when we left the city, the penguin lost its mass and disappeared. This matches up with what happened with that truck. This penguin energy might come from somewhere in the city, or from you. You look tired. I can't really get any sleep lately. I keep having bad dreams. Bad dreams? I read this 'cause it has chess in it, and got really scared for some reason. There's this creepy monster called the jabberwocky. I keep dreaming about it. So there are things that scare you, huh? Of course there are. I don't like mice, cockroaches, and bats, too. What's going on? Oh, the breaker tripped. Ow. Aoyama, are you scared? No, but I think I might get sleepy. There's a weird phenomenon going on. Yeah. You... Bats! How did they get in here? I'll get a net! How did you do it? I don't know. Have you ever manifested something other than a penguin? No. Let me do another experiment! Young man, when do I throw this? Very soon, according to my estimates. Can I? Not yet. Now! All right! There we go! Oh! We got one! Why? I have one hypothesis on when a penguin can manifest. It has to do with the light! Light? When you manifested a penguin before, it was sunny out. The next day when I tried the experiment, it was cloudy. That's true. It was sunny when the penguins first appeared last week. And then in the dark, you manifested bats. Penguin manifestation conditions in other words, when it's sunny out... You can manifest penguins. When it's cloudy or dark, you can't manifest penguins, but you manifest bats and the like. However, more verification is required... What are you... You're right. This is amazing. The weather forecast said it'd clear up after the rain. That was sudden. It took some time, but you figured it out. A child of science. There's still a lot to solve here. We don't know what exactly is happening, and what this penguin energy is. You sure love research. Today we have to celebrate. Why are you standing over there, young man? Right. Excuse me. Now you wait quietly here. It's ready. Is it good? It is. That's good. You grew up by the sea, right? Yeah, why? What was it like? Well... there were lots of hills as you headed towards the water. My house was higher up, so I could see the ocean from there. When the wind blew through the windows, it'd smell like the ocean. What does the ocean smell like? You haven't seen the ocean, have you? All right. If you solve my mystery, I will take you to the seaside. Really? So young man, you better solve my mystery. I will. I'm smart. You've gotten better. Not good enough. Hamamoto is extremely good. Who's hamamoto? A girl in my class. She knows the theory of relativity. So that's what's got you so in love. I won't fall in love with anyone. I'm not sure about that. You're the tired one, today. I'm not tired. Now you're lying. When did you go to sleep last night? I always go to bed at 9 pm. I see. You don't stay up late, then. Does something special happen late at night? Yes, everyone goes to bed, and the town gets dark. You get to go exploring. Are you sure you're not tired because you manifested too many penguins? I don't know. But I do like making them. I'd love to fill this world up with penguins. You shouldn't get too ahead of yourself. We don't know how all this works, but the penguin energy could come from you. I wonder why her face was made in this shape. Why do I feel happy when I watch her like this? How could DNA combine in such a way that I find her face so nice, and that she's laying here before me? Sleeping, DNA, happiness, perfection this is the first time I've felt so strange like this... I didn't quite know what to write. You're up. I couldn't see her for a while after that. So... the edge of the world? Not literally, anyway. An actual edge would have to be far away, I know. Like deep in space. That might not be the case. The edge might not be as far away as you think. That's what I think. What do you mean? The edge might be folded in on itself. You might have to look within. Do you think you could put the world into this pouch? I don't know. If you do this... Take a look. The insides have become the outsides. And now the world, is contained within the pouch. And you could say that the outer part of the world is now hidden within here. I guess that was a bit difficult. Think about it. You did it, aoyama! Aoyama, let's play again. Chess is boring. Aoyama. I'd like to talk to you for a second... Over here. Um... aoyama... Hmm? Is it okay for me to tag along? It's fine. What's wrong? Aoyama, hurry up! Over here. Hey hamamoto, this is the forest where the silver moon comes out, right? That's just a made up story. Huh? It is? I'm the one who told everyone that. Come with me. Aoyama, you're really going in there? Wait for me! What's wrong? We're almost there! Who knew this place was hidden in the forest? Wow... Hamamoto, what is this? This is the ocean. At least that's what I call it. Ocean? This is an extremely strange object. What is causing it to float? I don't know. That's why I'm researching it. The ocean gets bigger and smaller at times. My observations up until now have made that clear. Stop. You shouldn't get too close to it. These spikes come out of it. So we don't know how safe this thing really is, huh? Aoyama. Do you think you can help me research the ocean? I'm rather busy, but... This is rather interesting. I thought you'd say that. Summer break "ocean" research commencing research Observation station I'l win a nobel prize Good job, young man. Aoyama! Aoyamal! Hey, aoyama! Summer festival Hey, aoyama. Hey, suzuki. You're not with hamamoto today? Doesn't look like she's here yet. Right. You guys are always together lately. What are you up to? Sorry, but that's confidential between me and her. If you'd like me to tell you, there's procedure I must follow. You're going off about something again... You're just getting all lovey-dovey with hamamoto, I bet. - Lovey-dovey! - Lovey-dovey! That went better than expected. We're not lovey-dovey. Suzuki's a pain, huh? I'm sure it's because we're getting close to hamamoto that he's mad. Why would suzuki get mad if we got close to hamamoto? Why... That's because suzuki likes hamamoto. That's weird. Suzuki teases hamamoto. That's not logical. Yeah, but... I'm sure that's what's going on. Hello. Look. I'm wearing a yukata. Does it look good on me? Hey. I think it looks good on you. Thank you. Dad. Dad? Aoyama and uchida. I've heard about you from my daughter. Nice to meet you. My dad works at a college research lab. But when he gets too into something, all he does is eat candy and get cavities. Hey, don't tell stories about me. Aoyama and I are doing some joint research. Oh, well that makes us rivals. Hello. It's been a while, young man. You're interested in this summer festival, huh? Or are you researching something? I'm taking a break tonight. Actually, are you doing well? I'm just fine. Hello there. - Aoyama, who is that? - Are you a relative? She's a lady from my dentist. She's also been teaching me chess. Nice to meet you. This girl is hamamoto. She's very good at chess. She's cute. You're good with the ladies, young man. Aoyama and I are doing joint research. That's why you're been slacking on my research, huh? What research are you doing? It's classified. We won't publish our results until we're done. That's good. You can't talk about any serious research with just anyone. Aoyama, the bon dance is going to start. Let's go. But I turn into a robot when I dance. I'm going to dance! Everyone's having fun. Here you are. Thank you. It's done. We're going to check the temperature in the ocean with this. We'll know it's position with this penlight. This is cool. It's like a real experiment. It kind of looks like a penguin. I was going more for a research ship. Let's call it the penguin, then. That's a cute name. Let's do this. Yeah. We've made contact with the ocean. It's shaking like jello. Uchida! Aoyama! I'm in trouble! Real trouble! Huh? What's going on? Wait! The penguin disappeared. Looks like it was pulled in. Maybe we're dealing with a life form. Charge! - What's that ball? - It's floating! This is weird. Go! Hey, aoyama. Surrender. I won't surrender. Say you give up! I won't. Why are you guys here? You always head into the forest, so we followed you. Hey hamamoto, what is this? This is the silver moon. You'll get sick if you get too close. Fine, be like that. I'm not going to fall for your lies anymore. You're planning something. If you don't tell me what's going on, I'm going to tell everyone. Then just try it! If you do that... I'll never forgive you! I know why you're so angry, suzuki. What? If you like hamamoto, you should have just said that. That's not it! What are you saying? We're not lovey-dovey. If you like her, you should tell her in a more logical fashion. You don't know how I feel! It's not embarrassing to like someone. That's not it! I'm going to get you! - Say you give up! - You're too heavy! I won't say anything... You never give up! That's right, I don't! I'll send the penguins after you if you do anything bad again. Hey there, young man. Are you okay? I think you were immature just now. I don't want to hear that from you. But you've saved us. Looks like you've uncovered something strange again. Something's happening! Aoyama, let's get away! It's dangerous here! Uchida! Looks like I've gone and done it now. You've known about this for a while, haven't you? No fair! I told you about the ocean. I wanted to know where the penguins were coming from. I'm sorry. I had to keep it a secret. I had promised her. If other people found out, she might have been captured by researchers, or something. You didn't trust me? That's not the case. Anyway, we now know that my penguin highway research, and our ocean research are connected. Dad's advice: Check to see if everything is part of one large problem. I realize I was in the wrong for keeping you both in the dark. And there is one thing I'd like to suggest. What do you think about having onee-San join us in our research? We can't solve this mystery operating separately. This is one single problem. No. I don't want adults researching with us. That surprised me. This is our research. Please do not come here anymore. Why is hamamoto so against this? I guess I went too far. Hmm? Things have gotten pretty mysterious. You should be more careful. Yeah, but I don't really know what's going on, either. I didn't think my penguins were even related to what's going on here. So young man, what was that? We still don't know what the ocean is. There's too many mysteries. What happened today was completely abnormal. But there was one thing in particular... There was an instant where the ocean and the penguins reacted with each other. When they were all underneath it? It's possible the source for the penguin energy might be the ocean. I bet the penguin we had disappeared because we were too far from the ocean. You mean penta? In other words, the penguins came to this forest in search of the ocean. But they're destroying the ocean... Huh? That doesn't make sense. There's someone here. What are you doing here? Oh, sorry. I got lost looking for these two kids. If you keep heading along that path, it'll get you out of here. This forest is dangerous. You shouldn't be in here. No problem. Did you guys... See anything strange around here? Um... No, we didn't see anything. Let's go. I wonder who they were... I'm sure they're looking for the ocean. They're going to find out about you, too. Huh? Why's that? You're involved in this. If they find out you can manifest penguins... You're going to get caught and turned into a research subject. That won't happen. Adults wouldn't believe it. I don't think we can be too careful. Also, even if something like that were to happen... I'll just go "poof" before they try to experiment on me. No problem at all. Anyway, please don't manifest penguins without good cause. - Brother, it's time for food! - I'm coming! One problem? Researchers? Probably looking for the ocean? Onee-San. Brother! The past few days we've gotten several eyewitness accounts of this strange unknown creature. New species? Sudden mutation? Is there a new creature out there? This is an illustration based on the information we've received. According to a specialist, in the history of biology... That's scary... I'm heading out. See you later. What's wrong? They say a streetlight disappeared this time. It was a vending machine the other day, right? Please don't get too close. There's been a lot of weird incidents lately. Oh yeah, masuda's husband saw that creature. Sounds dangerous. - Aoyama! - Let's go to the forest! Right. I wonder if the children will be okay... Something... Strange is happening... I wonder if they found the ocean. Hamamoto might be in the field. Let's find a different entrance. Aoyama, you know... There's something I want to tell you. I've been continuing project Amazon. If you follow the stream, you find its source, a river. I walked along its shore. I was surprised when I did that. I came back to the same stream. Huh? Basically... There's no end to the river. It just circles around. Is that true? Yeah. I walked along it a bunch of times to be sure. Aoyama, this is strange, right? There's penguins here, too. Wait, uchida. Aoyama... It's entering a growth period. The largest thus far. Hamamoto, we need to talk. What is it? The ocean might be too dangerous for us to handle ourselves. What do you mean? Disappearance of the penguin the strange phenomena that happened that day were just so weird... It might be difficult for us to figure everything out ourselves. The things happening in town are probably all related. The adults are searching for this. If they find it, I imagine we'll have to give them all our research anyway. But... I can't tell the researchers about onee-San. That's why I'm thinking... We need to stop our research immediately. We won't show what we've researched so far to anyone. The relationship between the ocean and penguins, and the penguins and onee-San... We'll just forget it all. I don't want to do this! This is our research! I don't want to leave it behind. The stuff with onee-San won't get found out unless one of us talks! You just want to protect her! Don't fight, both of you. You just like onee-San because you like boobs, right? I admit I do like boobs, but my affection for onee-San is separate. What are you talking about? But onee-San has boobs, doesn't she? She does. Large ones. I've had enough! Hello. Oh, it's been a while. Need us to look at you? No, there's something else. I'd like to talk to you a bit. Is this a tornado? It might look that way, but I research weather at a university. These are the strange phenomena we've been observing recently. This town is experiencing strange incidents that we cannot explain. I see... I just happened to look at my daughter's notes. There's information about a strange object deep in the forest, and about the penguins. And... Information about you. Huh? I realize I'm being rather presumptive here. However, my daughter might be young, but she's a proper researcher. What she wrote started bugging me... I thought about asking her directly, but I didn't want to bring her into this. I would be happy if I could get your cooperation. Hello. Hello. Researching? Yes, what about you? Getting my cavities taken care of. You shouldn't eat too many sweets. Be careful not to get any cavities. Oh, hey there, young man. - Um... - Hey. Want to go to that seaside town tomorrow? Hey, young man. First time going to the ocean, right? Yeah. I wonder how many years it'll have been since I was home. What's wrong, young man? You seem down. I'm always doing well. How about you? I've been feeling pretty good, I guess. I want to let out some penguins, though. I've been holding back, as you asked. I see. It makes sense if you're the source for the penguin energy. If it was the ocean, then it wouldn't make sense for the penguins to destroy it. You know... There were a lot of adults at the entrance to the forest. At this rate, the ocean, the penguins, and you will be found out. And... You're sure worried about a lot. I haven't solved your mystery... So are you sure you want to take me to the seaside town? That's what you're thinking? It's fine. I'm the one who wants to go. Once we get there, let's forget about everything, okay? It's summer break, young man. Okay... Hey. Are you okay? I'm a little dizzy... We shouldn't go to the beach today. Why? All I need is to rest a little. You shouldn't push yourself. Let's call it a day. Hold on, young man. I was fine this morning. I'm sorry. It's fine. You're sure a gentleman. Children should be more selfish. I'm not a child. Sure you are. Let's try again tomorrow. It doesn't have to be tomorrow. You shouldn't move! Are you okay? What's going on... The jabberwockies... Jabberwockies... I'm fine now. It's okay. I have emergency rations. You need to eat something. Sorry, I can't. I... I haven't eaten anything for two to three days. I'm just not hungry. But it isn't affecting me at all. I wonder what's going on with me... Summer break's gonna come to an end. No matter how much fun you have, it eventually comes to an end. That's the truth. What kind of present do you want? A notebook from a foreign country. Okay, I'll get one. Is that research of yours going well? It's really difficult. There's lots of problems, and it feels like they're all connected. But... But right now I don't know anything else. Oh, you sound like you've lost faith. The mysteries you find, the small discoveries you make, write them all down on a single piece of paper. And keep staring at it. Will that tell me the answer? Think about different ways of pairing up everything you wrote down. Envision them all flying around in your mind. If that doesn't help, try to stop thinking. Huh? Play well, eat well, sleep well. If you do, all the things in your head that are separate will suddenly connect. "Eureka", they call it. Don't worry. Good morning! Hey there! You're so tanned! =I went to the beach! Well? You've never seen anything like this, right? - It's a new species! - A new species! A new species! Amazing, huh? What's going on? Suzuki and his gang said they caught a weird creature. I went adventuring in that forest! And I found it in the river! So then we... Aoyama, is that... A jabberwocky. Hold it right there! You don't get to see it! This is our find! It's top secret! Everybody, did you solve the problem? Okay, the rest is homework. Okay. There's a typhoon tonight, so head straight home. I hope the people who fell asleep will be okay... Excuse me for a second. Sure... Suzuki, kobayashi, Nagasaki. All three of you, come to the staff room. There's scientists who want to talk to you. Scientists? Aww, jeez... Sure thing! We're gonna be famous! Wait, suzuki. You remember our promise, right? What? We're just going to tell them what we found. What is this promise? Are they from the university? Bye-bye! See you later! Suzuki never came back, huh? I'm closing the door. That's the guy from before! They went towards the forest. Let's go! Aoyama? I'm sorry. I have someplace to go first. I'll catch up! Wait! Jeez! Forget you! It's me! Aoyama! Please eat this - aoyama I knew it. Here, too! There they are! - And this... - Daddy! What's going on here? What are you doing here? Go home! No! We want to go inside the forest! No! Go home, now! Man, it was a huge surprise! It's the discovery of the century! Why are they here? They told us about the forest. So they've been asked to help... hey! I'll never forgive you, ever! What's your problem? - I'll never forgive you! - Stop it! - I'll never forgive you! - Hey! Oh? You're finally back! I told you to come home early! Mom, I'm about to experiment with fasting. Huh? For the next three days, I'm not going to eat. As your mother, I'm opposed to this experiment. I'll eat three times as much when I'm done! Wait! Hey! Research lab q: How can onee-San fast for three days and be fine? Do people not have to eat? > I'll experiment myself. The penguins are born from onee-San. Many things transform into them. The penguins survive off of penguin energy. Does the ocean warp spacetime? When onee-San is feeling good, she wants to make penguins. The jabberwocky eats the penguins. Brother, it's dinner time! I'm not eating! You're so stubborn. Ocean size changes rain... clear Use a1 to 5s scale to describe my hunger level? Doctor, it's dangerous! We have to get back! Just a little further! What is this? What's wrong? Mom... mom's gonna die! Where is she? Ow... What's going on? That's going to happen a long time from now, isn't it? Yeah. But... she's going to die, right? Well, yeah, but... Why? All living things die eventually. Even dogs and penguins... And humans. But I don't want that! Don't say that... I don't like it either. See? You should've listened to your mom. Stay home from school. And your experiment's canceled, okay? Il don't want to eat... Eat anyway. I'll make you some porridge, just wait a second. The fast was a failure. Humans suffer if they try to skip even one day's food. How did onee-San go three days without eating? I came to an unknown planet. That's my spaceship. It's a very mysterious place! Is there anybody here? That's a blue whale, and there are penguins too. It's so big... Way bigger than me. The penguins! Onee-San? What's she doing here? I've always been here. This is the earth. That's strange... I came a long way. If you go far enough, you return to where you started. Huh? What... Onee-San! Onee-San... I feel sorry for you. You must feel awful. Onee-San... I'm doing fine, but you're bedridden. That doesn't happen too often. What are you doing here? I came to see you. The research team found the ocean. You can't make any penguins. Don't worry about me. Make sure you're eating properly. And eat something too, please. I tried doing an experiment on myself, for a week. I haven't eaten anything. You can't do any experiments like that. They'll make your breasts smaller. I'm fine because I have the penguin energy. That's not energy for humans. I'm sorry. Don't cry, young man. I'm not crying. How to achieve Eureka Good morning. Bye! Brother! I'm leaving without you! I'll be back later. Can you solve this mystery? Eureka... Aoyama, you're over your cold, huh? Yeah. Aoyama, what are you doing? Yeah. It was so small! And guess what happened then! They just said something in the office! Put the TV on! You need to get permission first! It's an emergency! An evacuation order was just issued. According to news we've just received, the unknown sphere continues to expand... That's near the gym! Several researchers were caught up in it. =that's bad! - What is that? It's scary. - The missing researchers... Belong to a local college, and were investigating unusual phenomena at the site. Everyone, this school will be evacuated due to a nearby disaster. Please remain in your classroom until further instructions. Hey, you're not allowed to turn on the TV! - It's an emergency, though! - Quiet. Turn that off and go sit down. Tell us what happened! They're investigating it now. Oh wow! This is kind of exciting! Ma'am, my dad... Yeah, I know. I'm worried too, but wait here for now. Let me go, please! You can't leave the school! It's dangerous! I know it's hard, but I'm sure he'll be back! Don't worry! Hamamoto! Hey! - Get back to your seat! - Let me go! Calm down, everyone! It'll be fine. Just wait a second. Hamamoto, are you okay? What happened? You heard, right? The ocean swallowed up my dad. I'm sure he got too focused on his research, and... The ocean is dangerous. =I know that! Is my dad gonna die? The penguin ship never came back... If I'd only told them the ocean was dangerous... This never would've happened! Right? Hey, what do I do? All I know is what I should do. Aoyama, sit down. Aoyama, please... Ma'am, hamamoto isn't feeling well. I'm going to take her to the nurse's office. We can't leave out the front door. Hey, aoyama, what do we do? Hamamoto, calm down and listen to me. We need onee-San's help to save your dad. Her penguins might be able to do something about the ocean. But won't they destroy it? Maybe. But hamamoto, for now, I want you to believe me. Aoyama. I'll go with you! Uchida... Hey! Now what? If you're leaving school, we'll help. Huh? So... will you forgive me, hamamoto? I don't know. Thank you. Please help. There's a secret way out. Follow me! Hey! Hey, you! Get back here! Oh no, hurry! Hamamoto! Are you okay? Oh, no! This way! Hey, what is that? Wow! =lt's the ocean! Is that what you were researching? Hey, what are you doing? You need to evacuate! Everybody, run! Hold it! No! Let me go! Take this! Run, aoyama! It seems the mystery's been solved. Yes. Just like the penguins aren't real penguins, you're... Not a real human. Yeah. You, the penguins, and the ocean were all linked. It seems to have been fueling both you and the penguins. The penguin energy, right? That's right. Since the penguins can destroy the ocean, I assume that's a particularly important characteristic. Darn, we need to hide! This isn't good. Ow. So, young man... What's the ocean? The ocean warps both space and time. That's why I hypothesize that it should not exist in this world. And if that's true, and the ocean isn't a physical object, if it's a hole... A hole? A hole in the world. Or maybe it's the edge of the world, that's folded in on itself somehow. You're kidding... The penguins weren't destroying the ocean. They were repairing the world. So I create the penguins in order to plug that hole in the world? It's a hypothesis, but it explains everything. Great... - Okay, we're heading back. - Yes, sir. Looks like they're gone. But you... You create the penguins, which repair it, but you also create the jabberwockies. The jabberwockies eat the penguins... This goes against your role. Maybe they were created because I asked you not to make any more penguins! No, young man. It's not your fault. I would have created the penguins no matter what you said. Instead, I was the one who decided to sit around and not do anything. I don't know how to put it... I guess I wanted to stay in this world. Thank you for coming up with all of that, young man. Well, it's gotten pretty big. I hope Dr. hamamoto and the others are okay. We sent the penguin ship inside, but it never came back. What's that? It's a research vessel we made. If the world really does have some kind of "edge" it may be floating out there somewhere. Guess we'll just try heading into it. Aoyama, it's dangerous from here on out. You wait here. What about them? No, I can't let you go alone. I'm going too! Even if you try to stop me! You're just a kid, silly. You need to evacuate! But it'll probably be okay. We've got the penguins. Alright! Let's go, everyone! Hey! Stop! You can be the ringmaster at a penguin circus! That sounds wonderful! I should have tried that out! The whole world is turning weird! Well, this is crazy! How pretty! There's more and more of them! There's so many! It's the ocean! We're going to crash into it! We're inside the ocean? It seems we're still alive... I wonder where Dr. hamamoto is. Oh, penguins... Take us there. We really have gone beyond the edge of the world. Yes. Take a look. It's like god is having fun. I wonder why I have memories of the seaside town... I remember my mom and dad. I have memories of me living up until this point. Was all of that fake? I don't know. But I have the memories of my time with you. Those are definitely real. You're right. I wonder if the penguins are waiting to destroy the ocean. Maybe. Hey, aoyama... Will I disappear if the ocean is gone? If my hypothesis is right, the penguins will disappear. What about me? So that's your answer, then... It's quite possible that I'm wrong as well. Hey! Aoyama, what are you doing here? We came to rescue you all. It's about time. Is it possible for you to leave a little bit of the ocean? Why? If a little is left, the penguin energy will remain. You'll be able to remain in full health. I'm not sure if it works like that. But young man, we can't leave things as they are, right? Yeah... There we go! Well, it's time to return home! What's happening? I don't know. You do know, don't you? Maybe I do. But this research is very important to me. I won't tell anyone its secrets. Young man. Let's go. Hey, that's dangerous! Stay here! We have something important to do! Goodbye, doctor! Want sugar? No. It's bitter. I'm fine. Young man, it seems I wasn't able to keep any of the ocean. Yeah. Why do you think I was born? I don't know. But someday I might know. Will you tell me when you find out? I will. Is it bitter? It's not. You're always pushing yourself... I'm not a human... I can't believe that. I wanted to see you grow up into a proper adult. You're going to be amazing, I bet. Yes. I'm going to be a great grown-up. I'll be much greater than I am now. And I'll be humanity's representative. I'll go to space, too. I'm sure you'll be able to solve my mysteries if you're that great. I want you to come and find me. I'll find you. Sleeping, DNA, happiness, perfection it's almost time to say goodbye. You stay here. Don't cry, young man. I won't cry. It's okay. Right? Aoyama! Hey, where is she? Onee-San left. Aoyama... are you crying? I've decided not to cry. The mysterious sphere that appeared at a town on the prefecture border yesterday has disappeared and now, this morning, the evacuation order for the region has been rescinded, and the people are returning to the town. This incident was nationwide news, but fortunately, no one was hurt. And the local college researchers who were missing have been found as well. The penguins that had been appearing in the city were witnessed in large numbers yesterday, and some specialists feel that they may have been a signal of the event to come... Others, however, believe that it may have been a mass hallucination... There are 3,748 days until I grow up to be an adult. Brother, time for food! Every day, I learn about the world. And become better than I was yesterday. I can't imagine how amazing I'll eventually be. I'm sure I'll have lots of girls who will want to marry me. But I already have someone for me. So I won't be able to marry them. It may be a sad thing, to see the edge of the world. But even so, I intend to run very fast towards it anyway. Because I know that path will be a penguin highway. I believe that if I follow it someday I'll see onee-San again. This isn't a hypothesis. It's a personal belief. This time, she and I will ride on the train, and travel to that town by the sea. When that happens, there's some things I want to tell her: How many adventures I'll have had in my life, and how many people I've met. And how much of a grown-up I've become by the time I see her again. Project penguin highway and how much I loved her. And how much I've longed to see her again. What's going on? The risen dust dances merrily a photo album I hadn't opened in a long time hello, the world that you were seeing mystery solving never ends Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye good night you close your eyes so unguardedly yet never invite anyone into your dreams hello, I am not a distant memory goodbyes, I hate them Goodbye Goodbye goodbye Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye good night Won't you let me tell you how I'm doing lately how I'm doing lately how I'm doing lately
