The last city still stood. The remaining home of what was left of the civilization of new terra. The society had been all but destroyed by the robot rebellion '33. When the robots had turned on their masters by the billions the ensuing chaos had led to a radiation spill far more deadly than any nuclear warfare. The world had been brought to its knees by the robot holocaust. The remaining citizens of new terra are known as air slaves. As far as they know, the only other inhabitants of the planet who remain are the forces of the dark one, the evil being who controls the very atmosphere that sustains them. But there are rumors, stories of nomads who roam the wastelands beyond the outskirts of the city, outlaws, loners. A legendary breed who have somehow acclimated to the poisonous air. If you wish to be reactivated you will tell me what takes place below. I will give you a five second activation to respond. Please, master! I am sorry for trying to steal from you! I am at your service! You have three seconds. A contest, master. A fight to the death! Each month the dark one sends a transbot to each work encampment in the city to pit the two strongest air slaves against one another. The dark one? The ruler of all air slaves. Their labor fuels the power station. The station cleanses the atmosphere so that the workers can continue to fuel the power station. And you? I am but a poor freebot, master. The air slave encampments are my only source of revenue. I steal what I can from who I can in order to pay for the upkeep of my mechanical parts. What is the reason for these contests? The two most powerful air slaves must fight until one of them dies. The transbot then takes the winner to the power station for his reward. But it is said that the winner is actually destroyed. Destroyed? Yes, in this way the dark one can keep the air slaves from developing leaders strong enough to lead a rebellion. The power station. What troubles you, valaria? Something is wrong, I can sense it. Go to the crystal! Is it the amphitheater? Yes, dark one. What do you see? No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! Kill him! No, he is our brother! The fight is fair! Kill him! Stop it! This is no contest, it is murder! Interfere again and I will aim higher! It's no use, darling, we have no weapons. We can get them! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! No winner! Valaria? Yes, dark one? You know what to do. Yes, dark one. Pretend you are like the others. Father! - Do as I say! Who stands against the forces of the power station? Restore the atmosphere and I will identify myself. No, torque, stay! Restore the atmosphere! Very well. Did you all have to be reminded who is in control and what happens when the dark one is disobeyed? All but one. He will be attended to, but for the moment, torque, destroy both fighters. Take refuge in the crowd and save yourself. No, my place is with you! Deeja, do as I say! I won't always be here to protect you. Do it, now! Father, you are too trusting! It is you who need protection! Deeja, now! And now, old man, who are you? I am but a simple man, dark one. A man who is clearly no match for your powers. And yet, you breathe the poisoned air. I have no explanation. Perhaps a visit to the power station will loosen your tongue? Torque, take him. Who are you to keep me from my father? His name is Neo. He comes from the wastelands beyond the city. You are immune to the poison air? He can live anywhere on new terra. Why must we listen to a freebot instead of the man himself? He speaks to me telepathically. He will address you when he is sure that you will side with him. If he aims to defeat the dark one we stand with him. And you? My father is in danger. What do you want of me? When the air stopped, why were you not affected? My father is a scientist. He has created a small device which subverts the dark one's atmosphere control. He only had time to create one for himself and me before he was taken away. These work yards used to house something called subway system. There are many hidden rooms. He set up his shop in one of these rooms. Now that the device has been perfected he said that we could all be fitted for one within the next few days. They would work in the wastelands as well? Yes. I have been sent here by the rebel society from what you call the wastelands. We are organizing an army to destroy the dark one and his forces at the power station. If you swear your allegiance to Neo, he will go to the power station and rescue your scientist. So your tribe is some kind of hybrid race? You could say that. Our number grows each day. Now that you know of my father's device you need us as much as we need you. We don't need the device, you do. But an army of air slaves, who are no longer really air slaves, could aid all of us. How? I am looking for a friend. I think he's at the power station. Together we will go there and regain control of the last city and new terra. And so, the new band of rebels set out on their journey towards the power station; a dangerous trek through the desolate wastelands. Strange mutants live in the wastelands posing a threat to all who travel there. Hey, look at this! Don't go for your weapons. Who is this woman who walks through the she zone with male scum? The woman is with us. I speak to the woman! I walk with these men on a mission to save my father. Another man, have you no principles? I love my father. These men have promised to save him. No man is to be trusted. Then how can your tribe survive? We use men to breed with us to create future warrior women, then we dispose of them. Look. He is the last man who ventured into our territory. He has mated with all of us who are ready to conceive and he will now be destroyed. And he has nothing to say about this? The first thing we do when we find one of you is to remove your tongue. Men chatter so. You cowardly bitch! I would stop if I were you. Why? What difference would the life of one puny man make? Perhaps none, but there is a laser pointed at your head. How do I know you're not lying? There's only one way to find out. Isn't there? What do you want? A chance for a fair fight. A knife is placed in the ground and the battle of the warriors begins. Tear him apart! Rip his flesh! Let her go! By the rules of our tribe I belong to you, to do what you will with me. And what do you suggest? - Kill me! Because if I get the chance I will kill you. And why should I kill you? Your people are like me, aren't they? What do you mean? You can breathe the air. The dark one? We don't fear him. He sends transbots to tame us and we cut them into scrap. Your ancestors came from the wasteland. We have no history. We have always been here. Then there are others who can exist here without the device. Only Nyla's women. We had heard stories of them. You can help lead us to the power station. I know where it is. Then you will take us to it. If that is your desire. Once my debt to you is paid I will kill you. If you live that long. Free the mute. He will come with us. Kai, what use can he be to us? Maybe none. Sometimes people can be helped for no reason other than human charity. Men, they're all useless and crazy! Deep in the power station lies the pleasure machine, a reward for those who loyally serve the dark one. Valaria! Dark one, I... The pleasure machine is to be used as a reward, not for habit. Yes, dark one. It would serve you well not to forget this. The discussion has ended. There are other matters to attend to. Torque and the guardbots bring you a new subject for interrogation. Yes, dark one. Torque, have the man freed from his bonds. There is no reason for him to be uncomfortable. There, isn't that better? It will benefit all of us if you cooperate. Do you understand? You are impervious to our atmosphere control. Why? Your stay with us could be quite pleasant if you choose to work with us. On the other hand, I could introduce you to worlds of pain beyond your imagination. The choice is yours. I have no answers for you. A pity. I am losing Patience, valaria! Torque, take him to the crystal. At the crystal jorn can see that the dark one is aware of the rebel's every move. She's your daughter, isn't she? It would be a pity if she had to lose her life because of your silence. I have nothing to say. My daughter would want it that way. Then your daughter is a bigger fool than you are! Torque, take him to the room of questions. We will see just how long he can keep his secrets to himself. Your work is cut out for you, valaria. Yes, dark one. And the pleasure machine awaits. Yes, dark one. There! What is it? The caverns start here. Caverns? We should approach the power station from underground. The dark one has ways of monitoring our progress if we continue on the surface. Come. The mutants continue to follow the rebels even as they enter the underground caverns. We must be quiet from here on in. Why? Sewage worms. What? Sewage worms; Man-eating creatures from inside the void. They're blind, but they seek their prey by listening for them. Humans, they eat humans! This is their nest. If we can get to the other side we'll be safe. Safe? We'll never make it through! What kind of a woman are you? Have you no fighting spirit? Enough! Let's see how many there are. How can we make it through? If only we had some kind of bait to distract them while the rest of us slipped through. Whoever it is will surely get attacked by the worms! No one would be foolish enough to volunteer. There's only one way. - What? We chop our way through. Yes! - Ready? Now. Stupid worms, I'm not human! You owe me one, woman! I pay my debts quickly! How did I get in this mess? Just go away! You have saved me a second time. Now you can be his friend. Never! I owe allegiance to no man. I ask no allegiance. Only your help in leading us to our destination. An oasis lies ahead. There we can rest. A rest? What I need is a tune-up! Look at all this water. It's sure to rust my microcircuits. What's down in there? You don't wanna know. Our visitors continue on their way to us. The rebels, they're still alive. They must have the immunity, too. Perhaps, no matter. It is better that they still live. Better? Yes, we can use the girl's life as leverage or her death. We have nothing to fear. They would fall before the might of our transbots. Have you forgotten? The warrior woman has destroyed a number of our best units. Perhaps it is time to send torque. You have made the right decision, valaria. Attend to it. Has the man revealed anything to you? No, his will is strong. What power have you used? We have taken him twice to shock level seven. Seven? He's to be reckoned with. Take him to nine. Revive him, I need him awake! How can you breathe the poisoned air? You leave me no choice. Torque, you are to leave the power station and intercept the group that approaches us. And when you reach them, the first thing you are to do is kill the girl. Do you understand? Yes! Do you understand, old man? Your daughter will be destroyed. You will never see her again. Now, do you wish to say anything? Very well. Torque, go now. You have signed the death sentence for your own daughter. Wait! His wound is infected. What can we do? No! Get away! Get away! It's a force field! My only power as a freebot! Hurry, it lasts for only 30 seconds! It is still not too late to save your daughter. She may be immune to the poison air but she's not immune to a transbot's blaster. Deeja's life is her own, as is mine. Meaning what? Deeja would rather both of us die than have me give in to your demands. Do you understand what you are saying? I am not just going to kill you. I am going to put you through the tortures of the damned! When I am through with you you will beg to tell me what I want to know. Nothing you can do to me will make me tell you what you want to hear! You're a strong man, I will Grant you that. No one has ever endured the room of questions for as long as you have. Death holds no fear for me. Oh, and what of deeja? Suppose I have torque bring her back to the power station and put her through what you have endured? You will first have to catch her, won't you? Yes, that is true, isn't it? Near the entrance to the power station the rebels face yet another example of the dark one's cruelty. These are the winners of the air slave battles. This was the man that Neo was searching for. It was his father! They seem to be upset. Do you suppose your daughter's not as strong as you think she is? Deeja can take care of herself. And so can I. Oh, really? Perhaps it is time for you to see what awaits you. Behold, the dark one. And so jorn was finally face to face with the being known as the dark one. Halt! - What is it? We're being watched. We've been watched since we began. It's true! They can see all from the power station. Then we have no chance of taking them by surprise. If they know we are coming we must be doubly cautious. I have never been this far before. What lies ahead is unknown to me. We are in... What? Nothing, nothing! Klyton, what were you gonna say? It is called the vault of beasts. Why? The dark one has set a series of traps to ensnare those who would try to invade his domain. What kind of traps? I don't know! My microchip board does not contain that information. Great, so we're walking through a live mine field? I'm afraid so. Well, we can't just stand here, let's go. Alright, we move on. But stay close. In the amphitheater the air slaves work to fuel the dark one's power supply. Are we to remain slaves forever? The warrior and the others have been gone for a day. We all know that we will never see them again. They are dead! What would you have us do, roan? Each time we have tried to escape the dark one has taken away the air we breathe. He watches us now. Korla, all of you, listen. If we stop bringing fuel to the power station the dark one will have no power to control us. Are you mad? If the dark one hears of what you say we will all die! Korla, hear me! I have a plan. If the warrior and deeja still live the powers of the dark one will be monitoring them, not us. So? So, we will all go through the motions of bringing fuel to the machines. If the powers of the dark one monitor us they will see us working. And? And, we will bring sand instead of fuel. Tell the others! What do you see? They are in the vault of beasts. They have no chance of survival. What of the air slaves? Their work continues, dark one. Good, make sure torque attends to our visitors. As you command. They are all near death, old man. You can stop it at any time. Never. His will is powerful, valaria. No one is a match for your strength, dark one. There is only one way for him to know. Yes? Let him join with me! How did the creature die? We are not alone in these tunnels. Keep your weapons at the ready. - We could be next. - Not if we remain alert. Come. Why would you kill one of the inferior beings instead of the girl? Their path away from the body now leads them to the beast of the web. Very good, torque. Your programming is more advanced than I thought. You wish me to retrieve the girl? No, not now, it is too late. Whatever information we need will come from the dark one. He has joined with the girl's father. The others? If you have led them in the right direction they will no longer be of concern to us. I don't get it. Why was that mutant killed and why was it right in front of us? It was a warning. A warning? A sign that we should not go any further. And who would leave such a sign? The dark one. The dark one, why? If he wanted to stop us all he would have to do is alter the atmosphere. Perhaps he knows we are immune. Not all of us. The dark one may not know that. Well, I hope not. Kai is unprotected and so am I. Well, the rest of us are fine! Since you are just men what difference does it make? You are the lowest excuse for a human I have ever met! There is no time for this. Neo! Help! It is the beast! What? The beast of the web! Come, there are only moments to save her! Night will fall soon, roan. I know, korla. We must continue. But they will soon know at the power station that we have not fueled our share of the energy. The warrior, deeja and the others may still live. What good can come of that? If they can reach the power station their might could be stronger than the dark one's. How? The dark one draws his energy from our labors. If we provide him with no energy they just might have a chance. A chance? Yes! They are the only hope we have. Why should we wait out the night? We should strike now! The morning will be soon enough. The power station cannot track us by night. All the more reason we should attack them now! Sleep. They don't know if we are even still alive. He's right. Why, because he's a man? No, because he's right! Besides, if we sleep now for a few hours, we'll be that much more alert for what lies ahead in the morning. You're hopeless! A man tells you what to do and you follow his orders without question. I'm following nobody's orders. Neo just makes the most sense. Suit yourself. If we wake up dead in the morning you'll know who's to blame. Where's bray? Gone! And his brother called me a coward! He's gone on ahead. How long ago, can you tell? No. He is headed toward the power station. Come, we must follow. Have you freed the surveillance drone? Yes, mistress. It has been caged for some time now, so it should be very hungry. Go into the tunnels and prepare to withdraw it if necessary. I don't want it attacking the girl. She must get here alive. Yes, mistress. How long can we continue this before we are discovered? We must keep on for as long as we can. If the dark one has found the warrior and the others he would have drawn from the power source in order to destroy them. And since he hasn't? Each minute the others survive the power of the dark one diminishes. Let us hope they continue safely on their way. Bray! - Quiet! So, they have reached the chamber of despair. I'm impressed. They shall not come any closer. Of course not, dark one. I have sent torque to... If they do come any closer, valaria, I will be very angry with you! Dark one, I assure you they are all doomed. Except the girl. Of course, master, she will be brought to you. Yes, she will be, or you will have to answer to me. And I will not forgive the mistake! You have nothing to fear, dark one. I know, but you do! Bray! He is dead. The boy is dead, he feels nothing. Guardbots, go to your stations! Valaria, am I to think that you have failed me? No, dark one, they have only reached the gate. There's no way that they can proceed. Let this remind you of what would be your fate! Dark one, I swear I will not fail you, please! Very well. Torque awaits at the gate. The girl will be yours, dark one, I promise. Yes, she will be mine, or what awaits you will be far worse than anything you have inflicted on any of the others! What are we to do? The power in the gate makes it impossible to pass. Wait, I know what to do! My operational mechanisms are energized by the same kind of electrical force. I can adjust my circuitry to achieve a matching level of source input. The gate's electrification will not affect me! Well, don't just stand there, metal man, get working! Almost got it! That should do it. I feel like a new freebot! I will go over. There should be a release on the other side to open the... Malfunction report! I am but a freebot! Report malfunction! Freebot lightened, must repair! I will go over! Malfunction report! I am but a freebot! Report malfunction! Freebot lightened, must repair! Here, let me. - I will go over. Malfunction report! I am but a freebot! Report malfunction! Freebot lightened, must repair! I will go over. Malfunction report! I am but a freebot! Lay him down, this is going to take a while. You fool, you've let them pass the gate! Do you know what you've done? The iron wall still stands between them and the power station. Activate the power in all sections of the station. What is this? We're operating at only one-fourth percent of capacity. Is there yet more that you have overlooked, valaria? Dark one, no, we have watched the air slaves work in the amphitheater. They proceed as always. Then perhaps our visitors are responsible. Is this possible? I will find out at once. Yes, do that. Torque, go to the master monitors and report to me the level of energy storage accumulated from the air slaves. Yes, mistress. Be careful, valaria, the next move that you make will be the most important one of your life. There. How do you feel, bucket head? I am once again fully functional. I am in your debt. So what's our next move? We'll never be able to get through that wall without... Explosives? That would be helpful. Allow me. You mean I was jabbing around in there and the whole time you could have gone off at any moment? This is perfectly safe without a detonating device. How's it work? Here, look. Don't just stand there, take cover! Your time runs short, valaria. The guardbots will contain them. Look! What is to stop them now, valaria? There are more guardbots. And if they, too, are vanquished? There is one final obstacle they are about to encounter. Now. Stop! It's a bomb, rigged to go off with any further movement. Let him touch it off. He'll clear the way for the rest of us. There may be some hope for you yet. Alright, now what do we do? I've seen these devices before at the edge of the wasteland leading into the last city. Listen to me carefully, Kai. Can you hear me? From where I stand I can't see what you can. There should be a steel cylinder in front of you near your head. Is there? Is there a small knob at the tip of one end? Slowly move your hand up to the bomb without touching the wires at your side. Have you got it? The knob is a trigger mechanism. It is attached to the explosives on the inside by a very short wire. Klyton, do you have cutters in your tool panel? Yes, master. Kai, carefully unscrew the knob on the cylinder. When it's loose don't pull it away. Do you understand? Is it loose? I'm reaching behind you with the cutters. Take them with your other hand. Are the cutters near the cylinder? Kai, slowly pull the knob away from the cylinder just enough to put the cutters between the knob and the head of the bomb. Cut the wire now. What is it? The energy reservoir from the amphitheater is nearly empty. What? But we saw them working! What did you see, valaria? The air slaves, they... Air slaves? Pitiful beasts of burden and they somehow got the best of you. Valaria, what am I to do with you? Dark one, please. Torque, take her away from my sight! No, dark one, please! I will prove myself to you. How? I will bring the girl to you myself and she will tell you what you want to know. One last chance, valaria, and then you know the fate that awaits you. Thank you, dark one, you will not be sorry. Torque, summon the guardbots! Let me in! How did I? Oh! There! Oh, no! You see, dark one, I kept my promise. The girl is yours! You are as good as your word, valaria, but your use to me has still come to an end. But, dark one, I delivered on my promise! Life isn't always fair, valaria, especially when one isn't really even alive. Dark one, can you hear me? Yes, valaria. What do you wish to say before you die? You are the one who said it, I was never really alive. So what matter is it to me what becomes of you or all of us? Valaria, no! Yes, dark one, the self-destruction level! In five minutes all of your domain will be destroyed. The power station will be no more and you and all the others will cease to exist! Valaria, stop the countdown, now! Or what, you will destroy me? It doesn't matter anymore, nothing does! No, no! Where is my father? He is nearby. Take me to him. Tell me what I want to know. I don't know what you mean. Of course, you do. You and your father are immune to my powers. Why? I don't know. You do and you will tell me now! Go ahead, waste your stupid energies on each other. What will it matter? In less than a minute the entire power station will be destroyed. What have you done? What do you think? You're finished! So's the dark one! Torque, the deactivation lever is on the far wall! Torque, come to the room of questions at once! Valaria, I thought we had seen the last of you. Dark one, forgive me. I'm here to serve you. Please believe me. That is why you activated the mechanism that could have destroyed us all? But I can save us all! Our power is depleted and it is because of the traitors in the work yards of the amphitheater. Yes? We can force the air slaves to begin refueling the power supplies and regain our dominance over them. How? The girl will tell us. Never. Why should she? When she sees what's become of her father and what will become of her. All that remained of jorn was his head. The rest of his body was completely engulfed by the dark one. The dark one has consumed your father, devouring his strength and his wisdom. When you are joined with him we no longer will need to ask questions of you. The dark one will know them because you will be part of him. And now it is time to show the air slaves what their treachery has earned them. We no longer need them. With the knowledge of jorn and his daughter we can power the station from within. The time has come for all of them to die! Not again! Come on! Deeja, I'm as good as dead. You must destroy me. Father, I can't. I love you! If you love me, you know that this is the only way out. Father, please! Here, Neo, take this. Neo, you know what to do. No, Neo! We can rule new terra together! Don'tdo it! Don'tdo it! No! The air slaves! Freedom, freedom! Deeja, jorn would have wanted it this way. No! What will you do now? Go back to my people, finish my father's work. Deeja. - No, leave me alone! Your father was a great man. Perhaps if he had lived you could have told him that yourself. With the dark one destroyed the air slaves were free at last. Neo returned to his people to bring them to the last city. Together they would rebuild new terra. Neo, wait! I can come along with you, can't 1? I can be a lot of help to you. Don't you think? I can take care of your weapons. See that you always have enough backup ammunition. You know, be like a sidekick.
