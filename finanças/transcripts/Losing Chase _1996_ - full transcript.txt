So many words for A state of mind impossible to describe... "clinical depression". "Nervous breakdown". "Exhaustion". My favorite... "collapse". The philosophical sort might say I'd lost my way. Those with faith might hope I was trying to find it. But to all of my dear friends here on the island, I'd simply lost my mind. I'm going to the ferry now, love. Her name is Elizabeth, darling. Please try to remember. Elizabeth. Elizabeth. That's it. That's good, darling! Okay. My poor husband. I won't be long! Poor boy. I've committed the worst sin of my ilk... I'd embarrassed my husband. A slow, steady decline, and then... bam. Ha ha ha ha! One triumphant stand at gay head lighthouse in the middle of a spectacular nor'easter. I sure picked one hell of a storm. Yeah! Ha ha! Naturally, once they got me down, they sent me away. Any self-respecting man of his class would've done the same thing. After a lengthy stay, I was once again deemed fit for society and returned to the island where Richard waited with open arms. He wanted to reward me for my good behavior. So, something wonderful was on its way, something to alleviate the tension, something to help me recuperate. Was it a present? A trip? A ring? No. It was a mother's helper. A companion. A girl. A girl. I got this. You sure? Yeah. Well, love, here she is... The girl you've been waiting for. Elizabeth, this is my wife... Mrs. Philips. Elizabeth Cole. Pleasure to meet you. Likewise, I'm sure. That's good, darling. That's enough. Come on, I'll show you to your room. Okay. Thanks. I finally figured it out. What's that? What you remind me of. It's a good retriever waiting to sprint after his master's dummy. Rrrruff! Well, Elizabeth, what are you planning on calling me? I was planning on calling you Mrs. Philips, unless there's something that you'd prefer. How are your "ma'ams" and "sirs"? Excuse me? Well, were you taught to answer, "yes, ma'am" and "no, sir", or was your upbringing more casual? No, let me rephrase. Do you belch at the table? When you go to the bathroom, do you close the door? When you kiss a family friend or relative, do you make lip contact with the cheek? Well, I used to say "ma'am" and "sir" before my classmates made fun of me at grade school. Aww. Aren't children cruel? Well, Elizabeth, whatever you do, don't call me "ma'am", unless you want to spend the summer at home. You can "ma'am" and "sir" Richard all you like. Just don't do it with me, okay? Okay. Elizabeth, would you mind getting me a cigarette? No, not at all. Where would I find them? In my breast pocket. That-a-girl. Mr. Philips didn't tell me that you smoked. I don't. It's just for decoration. You can put that back where you found it. Don't tell me, let me guess... Um, you just graduated from bennington. No, Sarah Lawrence. Close. With a degree art history. Creative writing. Creative writing. I went through a similar charade at Radcliffe years ago. As you can see, it didn't get me very far. What make are those pants? Um, esprit. Were they expensive? I'm sure you could afford a pair. No, what I want to know, Elizabeth, is how do you pay for them? Well... does your mummy give you money, or do you have a nice, fat trust fund to dip your mitts into once a month? My, mother is dead. I am sorry. Well, at any rate, Elizabeth, you'll be able to buy a whole new wardrobe at the end of the summer when you're through with me, with all that money you've earned. I'm not interested in fashion, or in... well, then buy yourself a few ounces of cocaine and disappear for a while. I don't do drugs. Well, what are you gonna do with all that cash, then? Heh. I didn't take this job for the money, Mrs. Philips. I didn't take it for the money. You'll have to excuse me, Elizabeth. You know... I've lost all sense of decorum. What size are they? What size are what? Your pants. Um... six. Think they'll fit me? I don't know. Let's give them a try. Mrs. Philips... come on, Elizabeth, there's no one around for miles. Off with your pants. I want to try them on. Now, Elizabeth, I'm in charge here... let's get that straight. You do as I say. Now, off with the pants. You play sports, I see. Still warm. Please don't play games with me, Mrs. Philips. I haven't begun to play. What's going on out there, love? Um... elizabeth wanted to try on my skirt. Is that right, Elizabeth? Yes. Yes, sir. Heh. Ha ha! It looks good on you, Elizabeth. Okay, here we are, boys. Shh. Let's not wake up your mother. Shh. Let's not wake up your mother. Love the skirt, Margaret! Gotta run! See you later! Yeah, nice to see you, too. Where's the girl? What's she look like? What's her name? I'm talking to you. She's inside. She's 6-foot-tall, she's very hairy, and her name is Mary. She's dying to meet you. Mom, I've got something for you. Really? What is it? You're nuts! Her name's Elizabeth. You can't even remember her name! You shut up! Why don't you go inside and play us a song on the piano, little Richard? You don't have a goddamn piano! Let me see. My little artist. That's beautiful! Who is it? You. Well, of course it is. It looks just like me. Signing your name in flame? Scrumptious. Now where's she going? I forgot the bread. It's still in the oven. Yeah, go on. Richard, what is all this up and down business? I mean, can't she just sit with us and eat? She's serving us dinner, dear. I don't want her to serve me dinner, dear. Aren't you hungry, love? I just... i think all this ceremony is unnecessary. The medication sometimes takes her appetite away. You can cut Jason's chicken into petite little... no, I'll cut his chicken, Elizabeth. Dear, Elizabeth is being paid to cook and serve, to take care of the boys, to help you recuperate. She doesn't mind serving us. Doesn't that bother you? No, it doesn't bother me. Well, now, you've turned into a proper slave in no time at all. I presume you won't object to following me into the bathroom in the morning with a fresh roll of toilet paper? Pink, if you don't mind. Why'd you have to come back at all? I will not have you talk to your mother that way. Now, the reason your mother is home is because she is all better. Now what's she doing? She's eating. She's hungry. But slaves eat in the kitchen. That's fine. I don't mind eating in the kitchen. Elizabeth, wait, please. Sit down. Elizabeth is from greenwich, dear. She's used to being treated civilly. What does "civilly" mean, mom? It means like a proper slave. She's used to being treated with respect. Well, I'm used to being treated like a fruitcake. So what? This makes me sick. Nice try, Elizabeth. Not the food. You. You know what you need, little Richard? You need a dog. Then you'd be a happy boy. Maybe you're the one who needs a dog. Me? I've got Elizabeth. Haven't I? As I said in the car, the best way to handle those situations is to let her go off. That's what the doctors recommend. Yes, it will try your Patience. Yes, it will anger you. But just let her go off. Usually she just tires herself out. She didn't anger me. Well, you saw how I handled her tonight. Tell me... How do you like the house? We really only use it for summer. Well, it's beautiful, yeah. It suits you. Well, call me crazy. What do you mean, play a game? We never play games. This is stupid. I thought we might play a game before we all turn in for the night, as a family. Genius, Richard. I know a game we can play. Let's pretend that we're the ramsays. I don't know that one. Of course you don't. You're a literary ignoramus. Okay, who knows the name of a book in which there is a family called the ramsays, and there is a lighthouse... it's to the lighthouse by Virginia woolf. Very good, Elizabeth. Richard, you see? She dwarfed you. How do you play, mom? Well, I'll tell you. We're going to pretend that we're a family called the ramsays. And we're gonna go to the lighthouse. Come on, help me set up. I'm Mrs. Ramsay, of course, because all the action revolves around me. Elizabeth. You are gonna be Lily, okay? You're a visitor to the house, but you're an artist. You're young, you're impressionable, but you're obsessed with this painting, this painting with me in it. Come on, help me set up. Little Richard, you're gonna be James, only you have speak in a British accent... I can't stand this stupid game. Would anyone like a cup of tea? Lily, Lily! You're so kind! Her name's Elizabeth. And I think it's time she put the kids to bed. Okay. Are you Elizabeth or Lily? Because, you see, if you're Lily, you're my friend. But if you're Elizabeth, you're my slave. So, which is it? That's enough. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? I really don't know what to say, Mrs. Philips. Don't say anything. Don't say a thing. Let's go, sweetie. I've had just about enough of these outbursts in front of the boys. Well, I'm just so excited by our guest, I suppose I just got a little carried away. I suppose you did. I'm just not used to having such intelligent, literate, and attractive company. You can imagine what those people in the funny farm were like. I got an example standing right in front of me. Well, thank you very much. In all my splendor! In all my glory! Do yourself a favor and go easy on Elizabeth. You know, Richard, you're so bad at threatening people. It's not a threat. It's a warning. Ten-four, good buddy. Now, would you mind getting the hell out of my room? Your matronly presence just... that's not gonna work on me anymore! That was the reason for my last nervous breakdown. You didn't have a breakdown. You got bored. The show's not over, pal! It's just beginning! Don't push me! The hospital just a short plane ride away! Aah! What happened? You all right? I was trying to open the window, I wanted some air. Now you'll have it, won't you? Yeah. I'm terribly sorry. Don't worry, we'll fix it in the morning. Just watch the glass. Yeah. Good night. Good night. And then you just head till you get to west tisbury. Right. And then hang a left and follow the signs. I'm sure the boys can help. They know the way. Maybe I should've asked Mrs. Philips to come. She won't be up until noon. Let's let sleeping dogs lie. In the future, I just... she's better off staying. Tie your shoes, son. Tuck your shirt in. She's not ready to go to town. Of course not. I just thought it might be good for her. Don't think so much, Elizabeth. My wife's not ready to be seen. Okay. See ya. Hey, be careful. All right, we will. Bye. So, how long have you guys been taking sailing lessons? About for a year, probably. Wow. You must be pretty good now. Yeah. I never learned how to sail. I didn't live near the water, so that's why. It's a cute town. Yeah. You should take a left here. Okay. Where should we met you? Can we have an ice cream after? Yeah, sure. I don't know, Richard. Where do you usually meet your mom? In the bar. Okay, in the bar, then. Have fun. Hi. Welcome. You must be the mother's helper Richard Philips just hired. Elizabeth Cole. Yes, of course. Well, how is she? Very well, thanks. You must have your work cut out for you this summer... Babysitting the boys and their mother. Poor thing. It was inevitable. Truly was. It was sad. So very sad. The boys are darling. We're just concerned about how they'll be affected by all this. The boys will be fine. You should go meet the other mother's helpers. Our Katie goes to choate. And bitsey's at hotchkiss. But you're a bit old for prep school. Where's the bar? Thank you. Thanks. Wouldn't mind a drink myself. Okay, Bobby, go with Paul. Kyle, go with Peter. And, Winston... let's see... Hey, Richard, how you doin'? Okay, you're gonna sail with Winston today. Does he have to? Just get in the boat, Winston. Glad you made it, Richard. Hey, Jason, excellent... You're going with Evan. Guys, let's go, move it out. Okay, Richard, come on. Watch out for the boat when it comes around. Hey, look out! Another coke? No, thanks. Everything okay? Not that it's any of my business. It's fine. Thank you. You want to sign for that? I'm not a member of the club. Who do you work for? Richard Philips. How's chase? Chase? Richard's wife. I... i don't know. I just got here, actually. I really miss her. She lived this place up, I'll tell you. Heh. So, have you been to the island before? No. I've always wanted to. Isn't that strange? I've been so close for so long. Well, hey, five miles is a long way when there's nothing but water. Yeah. You know, I was just thinking that if you every need anybody to show you around, or if you wanted to go out, um... I'm sorry... What? Nothing. Nothing. The coke is on me. Thanks. Okay, I'll see you. See you later. Thank you. I'm really sorry. Come on, you guys. Feel like telling me what happened? I'll tell you. No, that's okay. If Richard doesn't feel like telling me, he doesn't have to. We were on the dock, and Winston said mom's nuts. That's all. And then what? And... and then I got mad, I guess, and I pushed him. And Winston's bigger, so Winston pushed Richard into the water, and then I ran up, and I pushed Winston into the water, and I shouted, "don't you talk about my mom, and don't you hurt Richard." Well, between you and me, I could tell just by looking at that kid, he was a jerk. Do you live in a big house? It's a good size. In the country? In a town. Who else lives there? My father and me, when I'm not in school. Don't you have any brothers? No, I have a sister. I have an older sister. Like me and Richard. Is she in college? Is she married? No. She in Europe or something? No. Well, where is she, then, if she's not at home or school or married or whatever? She's not well, Richard. Is she in the hospital. Yeah. Like my mom was. Do you think it runs in the family. I don't... i don't know. I'm not sure. Great. What? Just like Winston said. What did Winston say? He said 'cause my mom's nuts, I'm gonna go nuts, too. No. I... I didn't mean... You're... you're fine. I know you are, Richard. Where's your mom? She's in heaven. What happened to her? She... She had a hard time living. And her mom was sick Like you were, but now she's in heaven. And now her sister is at a farm like you were. And now her sister is at a farm like you were. I'll say it... you are a genius in the kitchen. Thank you. Tell me... did you meet anyone interesting at the club today? Um... no, not really. Um, except for the bartender. He was really nice. The bartender? Yeah. Wow. How was the wind, son? Just fair. Elizabeth, let's go down to the beach tomorrow, first thing. Okay. We'll take everything with us and won't have to come up to the house the whole day. Great. And mom can come. She likes to go to the beach for the whole day. Mom has to rest. Can I get you a sweater or something? No, thank you, I'm fine. I thought I'd go into town and find a nursery and work in the garden until the weather clears. This won't clear today. Guess I have my work cut out for me, then, don't I? I guess you will. You're really quite good at it, aren't you? A regular natural, you are. Is there anything I can get you in town? I don't think it'd be possible for you to find what I need in town. Okay, see you later, then. Bye. Isn't she something? The boys seem to like her. How do you think she's settling in? I'd say she's settled. Yeah. Isn't that something? You seem better, too. Don't think I haven't noticed. Well, maybe everything will smooth itself over, and it'll be like old times again. What do you think, love? I think it'll be all right. I think there's a good chance for that. Richard, would you mind Turning that down? What?! I said turn it down! She said turn it down. You might not mind losing your hearing, but I value mine. When's lunch?! Where's Elizabeth?! Boy, this weather is something? Yes. Came up so quick. Yeah. I tell you, I haven't seen the garden look this good in ages. Heh! Thanks. Can't remember the last time Mrs. Philips was out here. Used to be her pride and joy. So, who are you... Mr. Green jeans all of a sudden? Ha! Well, Richard, I didn't realize you had such an interest in tomatoes. Well, I don't... I mean, I love tomatoes, as you know, but I don't... hey, your little charges are demanding lunch. So sorry. Didn't realize it was so late. Really. Really, dear... You mustn't think that... don't humiliate yourself, Richard. For you. Lunch is ready. Lunch is ready! Let me give you a little tip on how to muster the troops. The gravy train leaves in ten seconds! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three... Wait! We're coming! I... hey! I was very hungry. You know where to find it. I don't want you teaching that wild behavior to the boys. Well, get your butt to the table on time. I'm the man of this house, and I'll get to the table when I'm good and ready. Just because you're upset with me, just because you think something was going on... what on earth are you talking about? Well, the garden, of course. Yeah, so far, so good. And, if the girl works out, and I'm sure she will, I should be back in Boston by the middle of June... Let's say the 20th for now. So, you take a little piece of toast right here, put a hole right in the middle, drop an egg on top of it, and you got a one-eyed Egyptian sandwich. Morning, love. You sleep soundly? Like dead weight. Good. I'm taking Elizabeth to the airport. The airport? She's taking the day off. Well, that was quick. Hey, if she's going to the airport, who's gonna take us to the club? Well, I can. You're not allowed yet. You boys will come with me. We'll put Elizabeth on the plane, and I'll take you to your lesson. Come on, Jason! Gotta go. This is gonna look so good. You look great, Katherine. Really do. So do you. Really? Must be the sun. I haven't been outside so much since we were little. It's such a luxury living by the beach. I wish you could see it. I wish you could meet Mrs. Philips. She really reminds me of mother. I don't know if it's true or not, but she does. It's true. Think so? They're everywhere. Who's everywhere? People like mother. You're not like mother. You're not a thing like her. Heh. Thank god. There's no beach here. Only grass. Nice grass, though. Nice grass. Nice grass! Where'd you get that dress? Did daddy... I don't get the beach. I only get grass! And you know why? Because you take everything! I don't take everything. You take everything! You stole it all and left none for me! How are you, Elizabeth? I'm hanging in there. Hanging. Hanging. No. Stealing. We'll see you next time, Elizabeth. Yeah. Heh. You look so pretty. You should look in the mirror. I bet you don't see what I see. I see the core. I see you! Ha ha ha! "Nice dress." I don't do a whole lot of it. I... I don't like Using chemicals. None of that gasoline-soaked briquette for me. Mesquite! I like mesquite. Yeah, yeah. For grilling fish... Beautiful! Just, put it on a hot fire. Yeah. A real hot fire. You sure you don't want a bite? Maybe I could fix you something for a change. Worth a try. Well, I don't think so. I'm really tired. I'll just head up to bed. As you wish. Good night. Good night. Mrs. Philips? Mrs. Philips? Mrs. Philips? Mrs. Philips?! What are you doing? You're killing the tomatoes. I kill everything. It's what I do around here. You're not gonna kill these. I won't let you. You think you can just sit there on your goddamn porch swing and take potshots at everyone who walks by... All under the guise of being insane? Just because you're smarter than everybody else on this island, you think you can just play your sick, sordid games and no one will notice, no one will care, 'cause poor Mrs. Philips has had a nervous breakdown. Well, heh... you're not fooling me. I know what you're all about. A man who, through no fault of his own, can't understand you... Two children who don't know whether to love you or to fear you! A life filled with incredible promise! Anything you wanted, you could've had. You were so goddamn miserable. If you had to do it, couldn't you have waited until we were away? Couldn't you have sent us somewhere? What in god's name were you thinking?! We were children! Don't touch me! You ruined Katherine! And you ruined me! You think you're so brave and you think you're so alone! You're a loser! You're a liar! You're a fucking coward! Elizabeth. Elizabeth. I'm not your mother. I'm not your mother. No. Mommy! Morning, everyone. Mom's up. Well, good for you. I'll be right back. Mrs. Philips? About last night, I just don't know what came over me. I've never done anything like that before in my life. Well, it's good that you did. Is it? I'm not so sure. Yeah. Where are we going to the beach? Go ahead. I'm coming! Here! Throw the ball! Aah! Ha! Nice catch! Aah! You have Done it again. No. We're a lucky family. Elizabeth, you've exceeded my highest hopes. A toast to you. And to my beautiful wife... Who's on the road to a full recovery. To your continued health and happiness. Dad, why don't you toast the chicken or something? Forgive me. I'm just... I'm so relieved things are running smoothly again. Well, it's all gonna fall apart if we don't eat soon. Son, I was just about to toast you and your brother for the way you guys have helped out around here. Dad, what about the grub? When you see what the grub is, you'll be very happy. This is a very special day. On sunday, I will be leaving for Boston to get back to work. And Elizabeth is taking over. Now, please don't be upset. It might take a few days to adjust, maybe a week or two. But, hey, boys, I'll just be a short plane ride away. Dad, I'm starving, I swear! All right. Elizabeth, you may be excused to start the lobster! Lobster! All right! I'll help. I told you you'd like that. Jason! We got lobster coming up! And now... Let me see that. Shh. It calms him down. Okay. What are you... love! What are you doing? Love, wait! Hey! Chase! Hey, chase. Chase, what are you doing? Come here. You're nuts. I do love that woman. What a treat! Yum! Only if you like kind of toasted cheese open-faced slightly burnt things. Just make sure you don't set anything on fire. Richard! I'd rather have Jason cook than mom. We might get sick and die, but at least the place won't go up in flames. Ye of little faith, you try that. Almost forgot. We got this for you. Yes! I love it. Put it up. Good thing dad's not here to see that. Hey! Just testing. Ha ha ha ha! So, how are you? I'm okay. I just wish we could be like a normal family for once. I think your mom's feeling a lot better. Don't you think she's feeling better? I guess so. But she's still not normal. Thanks. She'll never be normal. When was the last time you remember her being normal? I don't know. Maybe never. Heh. Your mom's a real character, but I think she's all right. Was your mom a character, too? I don't remember. I was really young when she died. I was Jason's age, actually. Come on, let's play. How many times can you make it skip? Two? Three skips? I'm not sure. Seven? No. Coming! Well, let's go, step on it. What's she doing? Will you please get in the back seat, Richard? Why? Your mom's coming with us. She's not allowed yet. Yes, she is. Thank you, little Richard. Put your seat belt on, mom. Okay. You'll never find Parking here. Just, god, I hate This part of the island. Why don't you boys go to the toy store and pick out a present for Kyle's birthday? And make it from both of you. What are you gonna do? Don't you want to come, mom? No, I think we're just gonna sit here for a few minutes. Why don't you meet us in... ice cream parlor! Okay, half an hour. How are you? I'm fine. It's good to be out of the house. I was just wondering why... Why didn't you leave the house before? Why didn't you just take the car and go? Don't need to. I've got it all here in my head. I don't need to leave the veranda. I know every turn of every path and road on this island. I know every inlet, every cranberry bog... The hills, the fields. I know the stars, I know the tides. I can predict storms by the smell and the feel in the air. I could sail you to nantucket by the light of the moon. How do you know all this? I grew up here. You're kidding. I thought it was just a summer place. Your whole life? Before I was married. What about your parents? Well, my father was a master helmsman. My mother was a painter. No better place on earth for either of them. Are they still living? My father's schooner was lost during a race to Bermuda, year of '71. God, that's awful. No. No, not really. That was a fitting end for a man whose life was devoted to the sea. What about your mom? She died while I was in college. Maybe you could show me the house you grew up in sometime. We're living in it. Well! Of all the people I expected to see! Jeez! You weren't one of them. Imagine that, Cynthia. You look well-tended. Any good garden will grow. And you are? This is Elizabeth Cole. Cynthia Porter. Delighted. Well, chase... How long has it been? Not long enough, obviously. A lot has happened since you took your sabbatical. Shall I fill you in? No, don't bother. My imagination has remained miraculously intact. Funny, I haven't seen Elizabeth at any of the parties. No, I've kept her very busy. Somehow that doesn't surprise me. Our bitsey's having a barbeque on the 4th. All the mother's helpers will be there. Why don't you free her for a night? Might be good for her to spend some time with the younger set. No. Actually, we've got something planned... Just the four of us. But thank you. Suit yourself. Chase always did have a knack for entertaining. Heh! And I've learned a few new tricks. I'm sure you're quite proud of yourself. Bye. Ice cream. Ice cream. I was so enamored, It didn't matter. Well, that's very understandable. So, what made you pick Richard? That's a long story. You know, when I was young, I just wanted to fit in with everyone, with the girls. I wanted to be like them, and I wasn't. I was always weird. And they all wanted to get married. So, I thought that was what you did. Richard's a good man. I loved him. I still do. Shit, I don't know. Ooh! She smokes, too! You naughty, naughty girl. I bet you didn't put that on your application form for mother's helper of the year. No. I also didn't let on that my family's a bunch of lunatics. Yeah. Well, we all have our moments. You know, I haven't figured out yet why i... It all happened so fast. I just suddenly felt like I was living one big lie. I just couldn't stand it anymore. Do you remember what happened then? Yes. Yeah, I remember. It was one evening, and I came out on the veranda. I could smell in the air there was gonna be a big storm. The phone rang, I went indoors. And, my god, it was Cynthia Porter, talking about some yacht club dance. And I was standing there with the phone in my hand, and the next minute, I was out on the light house in a raging storm, screaming my head off. And it was wonderful. God, it was wonderful. Maybe I was trying to get back to something I lost a long time ago. Heh. Or maybe that's bullshit... I don't know. Did you ever think about... Were you ever thinking about... no. No, no, no. No, I'm much too vain. Come on, everybody! Up and at 'em! Wow. Where'd you get that? Stole it. Where are we going? You'll see. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Who are we going Sailing with? Your mother. Which boat? The mahogany sloop. Hey, Scott, how you doing? Chase, how are you? Good to see you. You just watch the wind on the water. Just across the surface of the water. Always watch the wind on the sail. Watch the wind. Watch the sail. You see the sail at the top just there? How come you never taught us how to sail, mom. Who needs the club? You're the best sailor ever. Okay, gretzky, five bucks you don't hit me. Come on, hit her, Elizabeth! Watch this. Feeling good. Yes! I don't believe it. How did you do that? Now, don't send me. Do not... send her! Send her! Send her! Sorry. Some things have to be done. Yeah, all's fair in love, war and croquet. That's right. Ha ha! Right in the bushes. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit it that far. Now if I can find the goddamn ball! Heh! That's some look, kid. Here it is. Now I'm gonna get you. Now I get to put it on the edge of the green. Ha! Hey, ninja! Have at thee, varmint! I'm gonna get you, mommy! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! I got you! Elizabeth? What are you doing? The keys to the sprite. I want you to have it. Yes. For all you've done for me. No. Why? You've got a car already? No. Go on, take it. It needs to be driven. How can it break down if it's not driven? I can't. Come on. Come on, live a little. This way, you can't forget me. As if I could. Are you sure? Yes. Yes, I'm sure. Hello? Hi. This is Elizabeth Cole calling. I'm Katherine's sister. Yeah. I, um... I'm out on the vineyard, and I just, um... I just... i don't think I'm gonna be able to make it this month. If you could just tell Katherine that I will see her in August. Okay. Thank you. That's beautiful, Jason! Give another little pull! That's it, that's it! Mom, check this out! Make him like a bird, Jason! Try to make him dip like a bird. Just pull gently. Very gently, that's right. Ha ha! See how it looks like a bird? Show me! Show me! I want mine to fly that high. Here, give it to me. Okay, now, just go back. When I say "now", you just pull and run, okay? Okay! Now! Run! Run, Elizabeth! And pull it gently! Now run! Run fast! Just feel like you're a part of the kite! Like you're flying with the kite! You feel it? You feel like you're flying! Yes, I can feel it! Mom, come here! Okay, let's tie them up. Here, come on. Tie them over here. Come on, Jason. Come on. The first thing in the morning, we'll go down and we'll see if they're still there. But what if one of them gets away? Well, that's what kites do sometimes, honey. They fly off and they have big adventures. They meet up with other kites from other boys from other islands. Good night. Good night, mom. Good night, mom. Night, Richard. Go! You gotta hunt for your presents, Richard. No, you're cold. Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold! Getting warmer. Still pretty cold. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Steaming! Burning! Wow. What is it? It's a compass. It's very old. It was your granddaddy's. It kept him on course for most of his life. I want you to have it. "This entitles you to a lifetime of free sailing lessons with chase Philips." Thanks. Let them eat cake! Cake! Ooh! Cake time! It's your favorite. Make a wish. I wish it could be like this forever. You're not supposed to say it out loud. I'll get it, I'll get it. Hello? Hi, dad! Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Mom made this ultra-cool map, and I had to hunt for all my presents. Yeah, and now there's a cake on the table Elizabeth just made for me. Yeah, it's great. Here's your good retriever. Heh. Golden retriever. I thought we'd maybe... you know what the trouble is? Summers always end. You'll be leaving. No, I won't. I mean, I'll be leaving, but I can always... That's mine. No, it isn't. I found it. What's the matter? Can't get it, Jason? Okay, let's go. Where's your mom? She went back to bed. That's okay. She can meet up with us. All right, let's go. One of them's gone. Which one is it? Your mom's. Let's go. Chase, would you like to take the sprite out for a drive, just the two of us? No, thanks. Okay. "But worse than absence, worse than death, she wept her lover's sullied fame, and, fired with all the pride of birth, she wept a soldier's injured name." my kite's the last one Flying! I won. It wasn't a race. I'm gonna go in. Okay. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Richard! She's gone under! What? She's out there! She's gone under! Come on! Come and help me! We gotta get out there! We gotta get the boat out! What the hell are you doing? For god's sake, help me! Mom! Elizabeth! Help me! Get out there and help me! Stop it! Elizabeth! What's happening?! What happened? What's wrong? Are you all right? Will someone please tell me what happened? She's gone crazy again! We're sitting here, waiting for lunch, when out of nowhere, she comes screaming your name, while the whole time, you're up there fixing lunch! God! You know, what days says about you is true! He says you're unreliable! We'll never be able to count on you! You're crazy! I hate you! Okay, okay. Okay. You guys just stay here. Stay out of the water. Jason, out of the water until I get back. I'll take your mother inside. What happened? I thought you were dead. I thought you'd drowned. You don't have to hold my hand like I'm a goddamn child. I'm not one of the children. I'm sorry. What were you doing up there in the house? I was just doing what I normally do. I was making lunch. At 10:00 in the morning? Chase, it's past 2:00! He's right, you know. I'm not fit to be a mother. Yes, you are. You could be a great mother. Stop. You just have to figure out what you want! Elizabeth, don't be dense. Can't you see what's happening? No, what? I can't. I know. I'm... I'm sorry. Don't. Don't say you're sorry. May I please have some milk? That's orange juice! God, Elizabeth, get a grip. God, I'm sorry. So much for mom teaching us how to sail. "Sailing lessons for life." Yeah, right. She probably can't even sail for real. I'll bet there was some guy down in the hold giving her instructions the whole time. What a phony. That's enough. Why do you always have to take her side? I don't even know why you came. Be quiet, Richard. Don't tell me to be quiet! Jesus Christ, just be quiet! It's too loud. You're a messy tomato. And you know what? Tomatoes can't be messy. I don't know what's the matter with you. Pull them over. It's okay. I'm just closing the window. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? No. Elizabeth, i... holy Christ! How come you're in her bed? I was just closing a window. What are you doing? I was just... I was just sleeping. What's going on? How come you're in her bed? I'm not in her bed. I'm on her bed. I was closing the window. It's okay. Good night. Good night. Please pick up. Pick up, dad. Pick up. Hello? It's me. Little rich! It's late. What's the matter? Son? Rich? Shit! Great. Now you've given it to her, too. Now she's crazy. Richard, go outside, please. What?! Go outside. Go on, now. Why, so you can fuck her up some more, make her like you?! Richard, get out! No! God. I've got to get a grip on myself. You're all right. You're all right. I was afraid. No. I think I'm going crazy. No, you're not. You hear me, Elizabeth? Do you hear me? You're not. You're fine. I just want to be okay. You are. Take your hands off her, chase. Go up to your room. Stay there till I call you. Please, I'd like a minute alone with my wife, if you don't mind. I'm sorry. Well, Richard, this is unexpected. You disgust me! How nice. You have a lot of explaining to do. About? What's gone on between you and Elizabeth. Now, what are you implying? Come on, come on. Don't pussyfoot around. Come out with it. Don't be a coward. He saw you kiss her on the beach! What do you expect me to think when I leave, and the very next day, you go speeding around in that car?! Which I have every right to drive. That's my car! I can drive it when I want! Taking them out by yourself on some borrowed yacht! Please don't insult me. No, don't you insult me! How dare you go gallivanting all over this island, waving this... this perversion in everyone's face? Don't talk about perversion. Just tell me one thing. Did you sleep with her? No! You were in her bedroom last night! There was a storm! I was closing a window. And the boys, chase! The boys! Did you have to carry on that way? Did you have to subject them them to it?! I've done a lot of damage. I've been cruel, I've been selfish. But i... i... I love her. I... I love her. She's made me feel alive again. I wish we could just talk again, like we used to. What happened? I don't know what happened. Richard, she's brought me back. She's brought me back in a way that you never could. God bless you, but you never could. You're not well, love. You don't mean that. Yes, I do. I do mean it. I'm sorry. How could you do this to me? I love you so much. I'm sorry. Good morning. It's pretty rotten, if you ask me. Well, maybe Elizabeth and I will take you for an ice cream later on. Elizabeth isn't here anymore, mom. Jason, what's happened? Dad took her home. Well... well, why didn't you wake me up and tell me? I wanted to, but dad didn't let me. Well... mom? Maybe if we left now, we could get there in time. Then you could say good-bye. Hey, chase, haven't seen That car for a while. Look, I don't have a reservation, I know. But would you help me out? Chase, there's no room. Jack, it's a tiny car. Please. Yeah, for you, okay, go. Thanks. I owe you a drink. Yeah. Go, go. What are you doing here? I want to say good-bye. When will this ever end? Richard... Heh. You left your car, you little ingrate. Maybe you should keep it. You looked pretty good driving it out here. Last call. This will be the last call for the ferry to woods hole. Last call. This will be the last call... Go on, get on the boat. Well, don't worry. With or without the car, I could never forget you. I'm so glad you came. So am I. The world as I knew it capsized, and then, strangely enough, righted itself. Richard left on his own. We both got back what we had lost with each other... His manhood, his dignity. Hi! My world, my life. Hi, mom. That's great. Whoa. I got it. Big guy. Ha ha! There you go. Whoa, you're a strong man! Thanks. See ya. Yeah. Richard, what did I tell you about that bow and arrow? Little Richard would always be a challenge, not unlike his mother. And Jason would remain my sweet, irrepressible artist. You ready? Yeah. Can I look? Yeah. Aaaah! And as for Elizabeth, I see her from time to time... In my dreams. But they are only dreams. It was one hell of a storm. Will there be others? There usually are. We just have to wait and see.
