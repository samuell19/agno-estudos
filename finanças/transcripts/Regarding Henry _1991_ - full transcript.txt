Folks, we've been here for a long time now, Listening to people talk for months. Complicated medical testimony. A lot of emotion in this case. There is not a person in this room Who isn't sorry about what happened to mr. Matthews. It's a tragedy. And when something like this happens, You desperately want to blame someone, don't you? Someone else. We understand that. It's natural. What have we got here? What's the bottom line? It's mr. Matthews' word Against the east shore hospital, isn't it? That's exactly what it is. Now, obviously, any decent human being Would want to believe mr. Matthews-- Believe that he told the admitting nurse, mrs. Valdez, That he was diabetic. It would seem, uh...poetic That someone else was to blame. It would feel right. But, uh... it wouldn't be fair. Let's--Let's think for a second. Who's being blamed here? It's not some big, bad hospital corporation. We're talking about human beings-- Four doctors, five nurses, The hospital chief of staff present at the time-- All of them there for no other purpose Than to try and save jonathan matthews' life. I don't like doing this, But if we're all going to do our jobs, I've got to bring this up again. Mr. Matthews is an alcoholic. In july of 1979, he tried to commit suicide. And you know, even I was surprised to learn-- From the plaintiff's own doctors, ironically-- That this tragedy could have been caused By the abuse of alcohol. So here's my point-- We all understand Why mr. Matthews is blaming the hospital. But nobody could have prevented mr. Matthews' suffering Except mr. Matthews. Listen to me. Listen to me. The table you delivered is not the table I ordered. I'm having a party on friday, And the table sitting in my dining room Looks like a goddamn turtle. "We find for the defendant on all counts." That was great. Great, henry. Bruce. I'll see you back at the office. Mr. Matthews, everyone. Bottoms up. Mr. Cameron. Ah. Thanks. Like father, like son. Yeah. The old bastard would have loved this one. Only if he'd pulled it off. Mr. Turner. If maxwell calls, Tell him we won east shore, And he owes me 50. Don't give me this now. Cancel my lunch tomorrow. I'm working through. Move the dinner to next week. Pull the file on briggs vs. Gordon. What about the rosenberg breakfa-- Can I finish, please? I need that martinson deposition on my desk By 9:00 tomorrow morning. And call my wife. Tell her I can't make dinner at 7:30. Tell her to call the whoozits and make it 8:30. Yes, sir. Because you're responsible. And if you can't learn To respect other people's things, We'll have a big problem. You're not to leave this room tonight. You understand? The sooner we get there, the sooner we leave. You ready? Mm-Hmm. Rosella, we're going now. Good night, missus. Keys? Got them. I can't. Next week, all of our relatives are coming in. George, you should get a boat. And just send them away? I like that. Last year, when sarah's relatives came, We chartered this boat. Oh, god, the boat. You take them out, feed them, They stare at the statue of liberty. Everybody's happy, and nobody talks. They don't realize they're not talking. I only came because it said two. In the paper? Two fireplaces. So, finally, I get there, And she says, "no, that's wrong, But it's got two fire escapes." Juliette? Julia. Julia. George, you and julia really must come To our christmas party. Sarah's got a recipe for trifle You'd kill for. You must come. We've chartered a boat. Oh, come on. Good evening, mrs. Turner. Hi, eddie. Good evening, mr. Turner. God damn it. You should apologize to rachel. I don't want you dealing with tracy anymore. If she doesn't replace this table, that's it. Henry, Go tell rachel you're sorry. You never apologized. Did you tell the caterer we're 60 now? Ok. Hi. I was angry. I admit I was angry. But with a reason. My piano is very important to me. It's like your doll. Frank's your baby. How would you react If I spilled grape juice on your baby? His name isn't frank. Rachel, the point is, If you can't be responsible, Don't take food out of the kitchen. Finished a real big case today, honey. And daddy won. Ok? All better? Qui tacet, consentire videtur. He who is silent is understood to consent. I told rosella to get some cigarettes. God damn it. Frances said Carol's daughter wasn't accepted at huntington. They're all dying rachel got in. Carol's daughter's a virtual idiot. Uh... I'm going to go get some. Be right back. Don't forget your keys. A pack of merits. A pack of merits. Cigarettes. Look, anytime tonight would be ok. What a fucking day. Give me your wallet. Give me a break. I just want cigarettes. All right. Wait a second. All right. Wait a minute. Will you just wait a minute? I got to go. Ok. Good night. You should glue the keys to your hand, henry. W-What is it? Excuse us. Excuse us. Hello. This is mrs. Turner. Henry turner. Mrs. Turner? Mrs. Turner. Nurse. So he's, uh, driving And went off the side of the road. The doctors say forget it, no chance. Three months later, he beat me in tennis. Swear to god. You never know. You never know. Sarah. Sarah. Darling. We're here. We're here. What did the neurologist say is going to happen to dad? He said he didn't know. Rachel says hi. So does everyone. The phone hasn't stopped ringing all week. Rosella keeps rewashing your shirts So she has something to do. She's being great, just wonderful. My mother says hi. She wanted to fly in. You know, always trying to help. She asked what she could possibly do. I said, "don't come." Rachel got her school uniform. It's the most adorable thing. She put it on, And she said, "mom, I don't feel smart." Henry, I know you can hear me. Ok. You can open one present. We'll do the rest in the morning. Ok. I'll tell him. You go to sleep now. I'll be home soon to tuck you in. Ok. I love you. Good night, sweetheart. Well, I'm going home now. Good night, sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night, claudia. Good night, sarah. Merry christmas. Oh, my goodness. Look who's awake. Hello, honey. Let me go call your doctor. Hi. Hi. Hi, darling. Hi, darling. Mrs. Turner, your, uh... Your husband's incredibly lucky. The bullet wound to the head Caused minimal damage. See, it hit the right frontal lobe. That's the only part of the brain That has redundant systems. If you're going to get shot in the head, That's the way to do it. But...i, uh... Ahem, can't lie to you. I wish I had all good news. The other bullet hit the subclavian artery. There was excessive internal bleeding And cardiac arrest. Your husband suffered anoxia. It's a lack of oxygen to the brain, And the anoxia caused some damage. What I'm getting at... Is that it's going to be a long, Tough rehabilitation. How long? We'll know a lot more in three months. The brain is very mysterious. Even though your husband Seems to have the capacity to recover, There's no telling how well Or how long it might take. In some ways, He's starting from scratch here. Mrs. Turner, Henry can't speak. He can't move. His motor skills aren't functioning properly. His memory might be deeply affected. Certainly one day, Everything might come back, But there are no guarantees. He might not be able to regain his speech Or physical coordination... Ever. So how's dad? He's doing great, sweetheart. The rehabilitation clinic's Going to be much better than the hospital. He wants to get better before you see him. Can we get a puppy? Maybe we will, honey. Charlie called yesterday. He says this is a really great place. Everybody knows about this place. But he can't wait To throw you a welcome-Back party. And, for the 500th time, He wants me to tell you... Not to worry. Everything's under control. Just take your time, But get back immediately. It's so pretty here, isn't it? Hello. Mrs. Turner? Yes. I'm dr. Marx, chief of staff. Hi, henry. How's everything going so far? Because I'm the boss around here. You have any problems, you complain to me. What a beautiful little girl. That's rachel. How old is she? She's going to be 12. This your little girl, henry? Is this your daughter? Do you remember your daughter? Do you remember your wife? Henry. Do you know who this is, henry? What do you think? Look at you. Brings out your beautiful eyes. Come here. Look. See? Now, the secret Is to send the thank-You note right away Before a month goes by, And aunt maggie thinks You've forgotten all about her, ok? Are we going to be poor now? What? Jennifer lerner said that her mother said That with dad in the hospital And the way we spend money, That we're going to be out on the street in six months. Is that true? You can tell Jennifer lerner Her mother doesn't know what she's talking about, And if she has anything to say to me, Her mother better pick up the phone And call me herself. Who the hell does she think she is? Sorry. It's ok. Now, can you pick the circle? Yes. Very good. Yes. 1 for 1. All right. Now, can you find the triangle? Close. I'll give you a hint. That's not it. It's green. The triangle is green. Yes. Very good. All right, henry. We're on our way. Come in. Good afternoon, mr. Turner. Hey, bradley. How's it going, red? We're just finishing up here. How you doing, hank? Henry's doing just fine. Right, henry? I'll see you guys later. All right. Bye. If you don't want to talk at first, It's cool. I was a shy kid. Name's bradley. I'll be your physical therapist For the remainder of the evening. Your own personal gym teacher. See that wheelchair? That's going to be your best friend for a while. Ready? All right. My man. Mr. Casella. Watch out. You're looking sharp. Sharp. Bradley. That's mr. Casella. He's from kentucky. Hi, bradley. Julie. Check out the new uniform. Yeow. Mmm. I got to get me some of that. Don't get any wrong ideas, man. This isn't 'cause I like it. It's to get you back in the swing. You'll be playing basketball before you know it, Jogging 10 miles a day. I hear you haven't been talking very much. Is that true? Tell me, hank, is that true Or just a nasty-Ass rumor? Mmm. Must be true. Yo, gloria. Bradley. That's gloria. I already had me some of that. I'll leave you alone So you can talk about it. I love this place! This is fabulous! I love it! I'm so glad. I'm so glad. I haven't done this in ages. Well, you're a genius. You know that. New york real estate needs you, my dear. This country needs you. Now, I know that you know this, But if you or rachel ever need anything... Please, no. Seriously. Pity scares me. Actually, This whole thing's Making me a stronger person. Really. And henry's getting better every day, So... Sarah, this is me you're talking to. He can't walk. He can't speak. He doesn't... remember us. Nobody knows what's going to happen. I talked to our accountant last week. And? Well, it's not good. We have nothing put away, really-- A few stocks. All we have is the apartment, Which isn't worth what it was five years ago. Without henry's income, things... Maybe not tomorrow, But things are going to have to change. Honey, can I give you a little advice? Don't--Do not-- Tell anyone else What you just told me. Mm-Mmm. If I were you, I would go out with a few friends And spend a whole lot of money. Would you like to walk through again? Oh, no. I don't have to, thanks. I'll take it. See what I mean? Just like that. Come on. Ball. Now, you can hear the word In your head, can't you? Good. Good.

Henry's dad said. "I've grounded him, but I don't know what to do." I said, "are you kidding? I want that boy in the firm." And as it turned out, it was the best decision I ever made. For years, the halls of our firm Have resounded with the call of henry turner, Throwing on his jacket, striding through the office, Crying, "come on, guys, Let's go out and break some balls." I offer a toast to the years to come, When once more, we will hear that familiar cry. To henry. S-S-Sarah... S-S-Said I should say something. Uh, I don't remember any of you. I don't really remember... Very much of--Of anything. Um... Uh, it's all mixed up. Um... Like, I remember... Um... That rachel likes strawberries On her pancakes, But I don't... Remember... Any of her birthday parties, Although I saw pictures, and I was there. Um... I... I remem-Remember a woman in a blue dress Standing on grass. Uh... Um...

Oh, yeah. Welcome back, mr. Turner. Oh, hi. I've got this question. What is it? Um, uh... In this case... Uh, which one? M-M-Matthews. East shore hospital-- Your famous last case. Yeah. Yeah. We said That the hospital wasn't responsible Because mr. Matthews didn't tell them He was a diabetic. That was the argument. The hospital wasn't responsible Because they didn't know the guy was on insulin. Yeah, but look. In this file, um... This other patient, um, miss macnair, Uh, said that she heard mr. Matthews, uh... Tell the nurse he was diabetic, But she didn't write it down. Um, so, we're--We're saying they're not responsible, But--But we didn't tell them About this lady's statement. So what? Come on, henry. Put it away. Put it back in the file. But, so, um... What we did was wrong. What we did is paying for our lunch. So everything's ok? Still love me? Yeah. When are you coming home? Uh, I'll be home by dinner. Don't spoil your appetite. Ok. You, too. Bye-Bye. "Mix until... "Creamy. "Drop spoonfuls... "On... Greas-Ed cookie sheet." Let's make one big cookie. You can't.

I'm going away. Well... Well, no-- No one, uh, told me. Are you scared? Do you still want me to go? Me? No. I, uh... No, I--I--No. 'Cause I could--I could go to school around here. Well, I don't want you to go anywhere, but... I'm not sure it's up to me. Is it up to me? Well, look, I'll-- I'll talk to mom, ok? Ok. Ok. Maybe she could stay home And go to school s-Somewhere around here. It's what we agreed on. That school only takes 30 kids a year, And rachel's one of them. There's got to be A few things that we decided That I can count on. It's a great opportunity for her... And for us. I think it's important. I... I saw a house today, A place I think would be much better for us. It's so big here, don't you think? I found someone Who wants to buy this apartment. I want to show you this house. You think we should move? I do. And you think rachel should go away to school? Yeah. Ok. Oh... Hi, rachel. Hi, Jennifer. Sweetheart, this is a wonderful school. You see? You already have a friend here. I hate Jennifer lerner. You're going to meet All sorts of very nice girls. I don't think so. Of course you are. Honey... One--One of the things I do remember... Is--Is my first day at school. There were all these weird-Looking kids, And I didn't know any of them, And they didn't know me. I was--I was scared... But after two days, We were all laughing about how scared we were. Everybody feels like you do, honey. Everybody. Take care of buddy. I will. Try and teach him how to sit, ok? Ok. Well, come on. You don't want to miss orientation. Henry, that's great. I didn't know you remembered your school. I don't. Hey... How you doing? I miss her. Me, too. We'll see her on parents' day. Look... There's cassiopeia. And... There's the big dripper. And the little dripper. So strange the things I remember. Is this ok? Yeah. Ever since you've come home... We haven't made love. I mean, if you're nervous or something... We can talk about it. Well, yeah, I'm a little nervous. Um, oh, ok. W-Well, r-R-R... Really nervous. Very nervous. Why? Well, I don't... I don't know. I... Uh, look, I s-- I saw this movie, and, um... I don't know if I can do it like that guy did it. Yeah. Touch me. Sarah? Hmm? Tell me how we met. Uh... It was at chris lonner's birthday party. You were a hot, young lawyer, And I was answering phones At harper's bazaar. I was standing in the doorway, Smoking a cigarette, Back when I used to smoke... And you just came up to me. "I'm henry," you said, "And you're beautiful." I did? That made me completely self-Conscious. You had such confidence, You just drew me in. We talked for hours... Ignored everyone. And then the girl you were with got mad And wanted to go. And as you left, you handed me your card And said, "have you ever eaten blowfish? 'Cause I know this great blowfish place." You made me laugh. And I went home and told my roommate I met the man I was going to marry. I like it. The glass table in the living room, Next to the couch. We can keep the dining room table, right? Right. Right. What? Does this bother you? No. Then why are you looking at me like that? Because you never used to hold my hand. Oh. You didn't like showing affection in public. It bothered you. Why? I don't know why. You don't know why? No. Me, either. What are you doing? Come up here. Henry, what? Come here. I don't mind so much anymore. Sarah? Phyllis, hi. Hi. I thou-- I thought that was you. Hello, henry. Hi. This is phyllis and daniel. They were at charlie's party. Hello, phyllis and daniel. Henry. Well, um, I was going to call you. I'm having a housewarming on the 20th. I'd love it if you'd come. Ok. Ok, thanks. All right, then. Uh, we'll talk. It's good to see you. I'll call you. Big kiss. Ok. Jessica, I'd like to see the file On stevenson vs. Murray. I'm sorry, mr. Turner, I can't. How come? I'm not allowed to give you Any more of your old case files. No one can believe what you've done. I just moved in everything that I love. It's amazing. I don't want to see swatches for six months. It looks like you've lived here forever. It's just all my old favorite things. It's the nicest house you've ever had. I agree. I feel like I'm home. Hi. Hello, darling. How's henry? He's fine. He's here. Marvelous. Seven brothers and sisters, huh? That's right. Is it really hot in memphis? Very hot. Hey, how you doing? These little ones are really good, But that lady there in the gold dress Thinks they're a disaster. And that woman near the window... Mm-Hmm? Just had her face done. Not her neck. Just her eyes. And that other man used to be her husband. Says, "who is she kidding? The damage is done." It's such a shame. He was so good. Henry represented my cousin three years ago. He was the best. Everybody was terrified of him. Of course, I've known sarah forever. He's back at work. Doing what? Getting paid for doing nothing Doesn't sound so bad. It's not henry I feel sorry for. It's sarah. She's got two kids now. What can she possibly look forward to? One minute, you're an attorney. The next, you're an imbecile. That's not a very long trip. Phyllis... I am afraid we, uh... we can't stay for dinner. I wanted to say good night. Thank you. Shit. You can't let them hurt you, Those people. They don't know you anymore. Darling... I'm not going to work today. Sit. Henry, I invited someone over. Bradley. Oh, dinner. Thanks. So, what's up? I thought I could go back to my life, But...i don't like who I was, bradley. I--I don't fit in. I got bad knees. What? My knees, they're bad. Ask me why. Why? Football. Wrecked them both Playing college football. Man, it was my life. Football-- What else was there? Not jack shit. Homecoming, right? That son of a bitch threw a perfect spiral, And I caught it. Boom. Right out of the sky. I had the moment. When that safety hit me And I felt my knees pop, I knew that was it. Game over. Forget it. I was dead. My life was over, hank. Now ask me if I mind having bad knees. Do you mind-- No. No way. It was a test. I had to find a life. The therapist that helped me walk again, He was so cool. I thought... "That's what I want to do." When I told some of my buddies, They laughed in my face. Called me a nurse, Bought me white dresses and shit. But check it out. You're walking. You're talking. You're sitting here Drinking some pretty expensive beer. I had something to do with that. If it weren't for my knees, I'd never have met you. So, no, I don't mind having bad knees. No. Let me tell you something, hank. Don't listen to nobody Trying to tell you who you are. It might take a while, But you'll figure yourself out. Thanks. Hah. It would be a great story If we'd won the game. Yeah, hi. This is rachel turner's father. I want to talk to rachel, please. Well, I'm not sure it's an emergency, But I just got this letter from her, And she's... "Miserable." Yeah, but, um... She just sounds so sad. I just thought I could-- I don't know, Cheer her up A little or something. Yeah, I see. Uh-Huh. Ok, yeah. I'll call back, um, after 6:00. Thank you. This is for you, mr. Henry. Oh. Thanks. I going to miss you, mr. Henry. I like you much better now. "Enjoy your new home. "Your friend and partner, Bruce." "Sarah... I need you...now." "I feel you... against me." "Call me tonight." "Bruce." Henry, you back here? We closed. It's ours. The house is officially ours. Oh, god. Oh, my god. Henry. It happened before? Oh, god, please. Before I was shot? You slept with bruce before? It didn't last. He kept writing to me, But it didn't last. Everything was different. You were different. I don't remember what I was like, sarah! Listen to me. Don't walk away! We were miserable. You don't remember, but I do. I was lonely. We were in love once, years ago. And then we weren't, not for a long time. But we're better now. Please don't walk away... Not now. Well, I would like to. Could you do that? You could? I think that would be perfect. Wait a minute. I'll call you back. Please. Please. Talk to me. Ahem. I followed you. Bruce doesn't know I'm here. Uh, look, I don't have anything to say. I think we should talk. Well, I don't. Bruce was right. You were different. You shouldn't take it all out on him. He's been a good friend to you. Bruce took over your cases. He took care of things. He sure did. Bruce is so humiliated. He's humiliated. Look, linda, I know bruce is a friend of yours, And I know that you mean well, But this is not a good time for me. Henry, this isn't any fun for me, either. What are you talking about? I'm talking about us. You're not the only one who lost in this. I lost, too. I lost the one man I ever loved, And it was you, henry. It's hard to see you every day in the office, And you don't know me. This was our hotel. Every tuesday and thursday at the ritz. Ritz. You were going to leave sarah for me, And now it's gone. No. It's all gone. He-Henry. No. Mrs. Matthews? May I help-- What are you doing here? You remember me. We remember you, mr. Turner. I came to apologize. Are you kidding me? No. I'm serious. Um... Just give that to your lawyer. What's this? Your husband did tell the nurse That he was diabetic. It-It's all in there. I-I'm sorry. Why? I changed. I guess. Good-Bye. Hi, anne. Mr. Turner, he's in a meeting. It's ok. Got to go. Jesus christ. Excuse me. Charlie, I just came to say... Good-Bye. Fine, henry. See you tomorrow. Um, no, charlie. I... I can't be a lawyer anymore. Thank you. You've been really good to me. Uh... Just wait. We'll talk about this. No, I can't wait. Good-Bye. Well...good luck. Mr. Cameron. I have the matthews' lawyer on line three. Good luck to you, too, charlie. Good-Bye, jessica. Mr. Turner, what happened? Well... I had enough, so I said "when." Good for you. Good-Bye. Good-Bye, linda. I know this great blowfish place. Henry... I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. You were right. Things were different. Oh, henry. There's something I need to tell you. What is it? I don't like my clothes. Maybe they used to be my favorites, But I don't feel comfortable In them anymore. We'll get you new clothes. I'm not done. Eggs. I don't like eggs... Or steak. And, sarah... I hate being a lawyer. I quit. I told charlie good-Bye. Oh... Whatever you want is fine. I want us to be a family... For as long as we can, sarah. For as long as we can. I love you. Oh, I love you, too. I did like those mallomars, though. You're all learning what that means When you ask yourself, "Why do I push myself? "Why do I strive to be a harder worker? A better listener?" Well, look around you. There are the answers to those questions. Competition. Everyone close your eyes. Repeat to yourself silently, "I will... Work harder." "I will listen better." Buddy. It's her dad! Hi, honey. You taught buddy to sit? Uh, mr. Turner, We're in the middle of a session. I know. I'm sorry to interrupt. I missed her first 11 years, and... And I don't want to miss any more. It's good to see you doing so well, mr. Turner. Thank you. E-Excuse us. Let's go home. Hi, honey. What? Smell the grass. Buddy, come on! We all voted against it.
