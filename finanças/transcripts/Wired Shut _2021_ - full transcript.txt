That's a nasty habit. I did things that I swore. Were never gonna know in my life. I won't even see her again. My baby was gone. I had nothing. I thought about ending it all. Every morning, I had to come up with a reason not to do it. And then one morning, bam. I just couldn't find a reason. I was just about to do it. That call. Bill then Robbie. He said he wanted to try again. It was like a sun beam shot directly in. Lit up my heart like the 4th of July. You remember when we used to touch listenin' Sheryl Crow in the kitchen? You used to dance on my feet, tap out the beat on my hip with your little fingers. "Soak Up the Sun" still my favorite song. Yeah, I know I have a problem. I'ma be good now. If I get clean, I'm not just asking. I'm pleading with you now. Please just gimme one more chance. One more chance. He was the one great thing I got left. Hey dad. I don't know why you seem so surprised. Mom tried calling you. You're drinking again. I know. Mom thought this would be good for us, for me to come up here before I go to school in London. She wouldn't want this. What? Yes. London. I got in to the Royal College of Art. I'm doing my MBA in photography. Don't. That erm, that probably needs changing. I'm goin' to bed. ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love ♪ ♪ With ♪ ♪ You ♪ I need your WiFi code. Forgot this place is a fucking dead zone and it's time for your meds. So how much of that was true? Enough for me to sound convince... Do you have internet? What? Wasn't me. I mean you are on a shit ton of painkillers. Seriously? Can't you fix it? Fuck. Fine. Are we joking? Well this place has a backup generator, right? Great. Ready? 700. Pay up. Drink your dinner. It's your turn. And I want you to drink your dinner. That's not true. You know, I really think you need to eat something. You're gonna talk about lying? You? You wanna talk about lying, dad? Okay, yeah. Yeah, let's talk about lying. Let's talk about how from the ages of 10 to 18 I didn't see you after 6:00 p.m. because you were out writing when really you were getting shitfaced and pissin' away all of our family's money at the casino. Let's talk about the burner phones and all the dating profiles that you had under fake names so you can communicate to your dozens of mistresses. Or how about the time when you told me that mom's bruises on her face were from her falling down the stairs? Shall I keep going? or should I name one of the thousands of things that you've done and you never even once apologized for? You know, this was an opportunity for us to make up for lost time. I'm here because my mom, the parent who actually raised me asked me to. That's it. Goodnight. Jesus Christ. Shh! Preston, shut up. Jesus Christ. You're a fucking idiot. You know that, right? Yeah, I think we already knew that. I'm not laughing. Baby, you gotta ease up. And you made us late. It's not my fault you looked in the wrong place. Everything goin' to plan? I put the pill in his drink, but I didn't see him drink it. You didn't see him drink it? No, but that doesn't mean he didn't. Okay. Okay. We'll just have to prepare for the fact that he may not have and act accordingly. Fine. We don't hurt him. You're not getting cold feet, are you? No, I just- - We've come too far to get cold feet now. Does this look like I'm getting fuckin' cold feet? - Fine. - Good. You're the only thing that keeps me sane. I don't know what I'd do if you ever left me. You know I love you, right? - I love you more. - No. - Yeah. - No. - Yeah. - Mm-mmm. Mm-hmm. Where is he? Shit. It's so cute. I almost feel bad emptying it. I said almost. What are you doing? I'm trying your birthday. You really think that's gonna work? Well people are a lot less imaginative for these things. Shit. Are we surprised? He's not here. 'Kay, relax. It still doesn't mean that he didn't take it. I wanna check downstairs. Hey. You good? Yeah. Dear Em, it's been years since we've last had a conversation. Well a conversation that lasted longer than a few words anyway and that's no one else's fault but my own. I've failed you not only as a man but as a parent and a role model. I wanna make things right. I will do anything to make things right. You have every right to hate me. I would hate me too. I hope. Hi daddy. Shut the fuck up. The great Reed Rodney. Oh by the way, read "Countdown to Kill". Really bad. 'Kay, let's just get this over with. I understand. I'd probably be pretty confused too if I were you. In your position, I'd have a crap ton of questions. Who am I? What's your darling baby girl doing tying you up? How the hell did all of this happen? Right under your nose without you noticing. I've seen the safe. I know you have it. Let's not go down that road. What I need from you is the combination to open it. We're gonna empty your safe. We're gonna leave. Simple. I'm gonna warn you right here, right now. I am not a patient person. So if you don't do exactly as I say, let's just not do that. If you look at my girl like that again, you're gonna need a lot more than those braces and elastics you got in there. Those are my terms. What do you say? Reed? The combination. Fair enough. Hey! The fuck are you doin'? What'd I say? - This is fuckin'- - I'm in control here, not you. Relax. Fine. This is not how it was supposed to go. You were supposed to drink the syringe. You were supposed to be so drugged up that you wouldn't even understood what was going on. By the time you even realize that you've given us the combination, we would've been long gone. I found your letter. It was surprisingly honest. Em. Em? Don't let this fuckhead manipulate you. You said you wanted to make things right with me. This is your last chance. Are you actually falling for this shit? He doesn't give a shit about you. He never has! Did you really mean what you said? Goddammit. Preston, where did you get a gun? He doesn't love you. Think about what you're doing. I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm not gonna let you ruin this plan by thinking he's anything other than a sack of shit. I'm not ruining anything. You don't know what I was thinking. So just put the gun down. You'll thank me later. What's the combination, Reed? If you're tryin' to prove your love to me, this is not how you do it. I'm gonna count down from three. Three. Preston! ♪ Two ♪ Preston, stop it! Preston, I need you to calm down and think about what you're doing. Okay, shooting him complicates everything. Get out of my way. Not until you calm down and see things rationally. Do you love me? Do you love me? What are you talking about? If you love me, prove it. Get out of the way. Let me do this right now. I can't. I gotta give it to you. You have a beautiful home. I mean the elevator's a little fuckin' ridiculous. Sorry for the rude awakening. Guess I got tired of waiting. I'll tell you one thing. Your situation? Well it's not that great. Sorry, honeybunch. Could you repeat that for me? I'm havin' a hard time hearing you. One more time? Take a goddamn chill pill. Em, Em, Em, Em, Em, Em, Em. You stabbed me. You stabbed me in the shoulder with a pen. God. You know, I wasn't even gonna hurt you. I just wanted you to fuckin' move! But that ship has long sailed. Now you're right there in with him. Whore. What do you want? Yes. I hate fathers. Oh god. They always find a way to fuck everything up for me. You wanna know somethin', Reed? I met your daughter one year, 263 days and 14 hours ago. Now I'm not for mushiness and sentimentality. But from the moment I met her, I knew my life had changed. Remember that first night out? You remember. That stupid little bar. We sat and talked for what, six hours? Six hours straight. I mean I don't think I've ever sat that still for that long my entire life. I don't think I ever would've. And to be frank, I think you fell pretty hard for me too. I know everything about you, Reed. Everything. You're just like my old man. Only difference is you got nicer clothes, fancy car. And you hit your wife instead of your kid. You know what the kicker to all this is? This whole thing, it's her idea. Mm-hmm. Tie you up, robbed blind. Use it to start a new life. Ain't that right? Fresh identities, new house, the works, you know. Come to think of it, she even came up with this lie, about getting into school in London. Yeah. That was a good one. Hmm. Maybe I'm just waitin' for that absolute right moment. Now I mean when Em heard about your little accident, all systems were go. Darling, please. The men are having a drink. Here's lookin' at you, kid. Wow, rich alcoholics really have the best taste in booze. Mmm. It's your turn. ♪ Here comes the choo-choo ♪ That was great. Really great, guys. Really good. The biggest takeaway is this is 100% your fault. You made your bed. Now you're gonna lie in it. Yeah, it's okay. How's it feel? Huh? How does it feel? I mean you're such a worthless piece of shit that your own daughter would take you hostage and rob you. I mean even to a guy like me, that's bad, man. Yeah. Gimme the combination, Reed. Gimme the combination, Reed. Do you wanna know what your daughter tasted like? It wasn't that bad. That's okay. I'm gonna let you use your imagination. But I will tell you that she loved getting fucked. I mean really loved it. Isn't that right, sweetie? Yeah. Mmm, yeah. All right, let's get to the good stuff. You got somethin' to tell me now, Reed? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, you do. What is it, buddy? Let it out. Mm-hmm, that's a three. 14. That wasn't so hard, was it? Fuck. Come here, you. Let me help you, sweetie. Baby. Long time no see. No! You gonna shoot me, Reed? You're not gonna shoot me. I kept a little souvenir for myself. It's her wedding ring finger. Now nobody else can have her. Now maybe I can actually find somebody who appreciates me. Have you ever taken a life, Reed? You know what it feels like, to stop a beating heart with your two hands? Have you ever looked in a man's eyes? Look in mine. And knowin' what it looks like when it all comes crashing down like a house of cards. I have, man. Hey Reed, lemme tell you something, man. Run! C'mon. Move! Shit. ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ Let me hear you whisper ♪ ♪ That you love me too ♪ ♪ Keep the love light glowing ♪ ♪ In your eyes ♪ ♪ So true ♪ ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I ♪ ♪ Love ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ Bye daddy! Dad! Now you're gonna watch her cut her throat. Every day for the better part of my life, I've had this burning fire in the pit of my stomach. My hatred, my complete and utter rage for you in everything that you've ever done, it never leaves. It's created this hole in my insides. And it's there when I wake up, it's there when I go to bed and it affects everything I do in my life. These past few weeks, I've been doing a lotta thinking about who I am and who I wanna be. And I used to fantasize about the robbery and how it would somehow fill that void. But I know that it would've just made everything so much worse. More importantly though, I realized something else. I am sick and I'm tired of being so angry. I don't know if I'll be able to forgive you for the things you did growing up. If you are serious about being a different person, then so am I. What do you say, dad? What is this? Is this your new book?
