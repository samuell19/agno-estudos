Albert Einstein once said we can't solve our problems with the same thinking that created them. We have to expand our world to learn new things. I'm not where I am because I'm a product of my environment, because my environment didn't make me. My choices did.

I had to call his wife. He didn't make it. Are you serious? Yeah. That conversation, not one of my better moments. I'm sure. Such a preventable disease. Nice sneakers, Marquise.

You have to show me how to play. So therefore take up the whole armor of God And you will be able to withstand the evil today, and having done, all to stand firm. That's straight from the Bible guys, Ephesians 6:13. We have a real battle going on in our everyday life. Hey. You just got me killed. You don't need these things anyway, they taint the mind and strain us from our righteous path. Would you do us the honor of blessing the food? I'd love to. All right. Everyone bow your heads. Dear Lord, thank you for this meal that we are about to receive. I ask that you watch over our children, and protect them as they go out into the world, at school, or otherwise. In your name I pray, amen. Amen, amen. Can somebody please pass me that bread on down here? I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, come on. Patience is a virtue Pastor It's coming, it's coming.

So, being that you wanted to talk, I actually had something that I wanted to tell you too, something that was on my mind. This should be interesting. Well, we haven't talked about this in a while, but. What's all that? I already know what this is about. Okay, so tell me what it's about then, since you know. You don't know how much longer you can go without me giving myself to you. You're funny. I know you like a book. No, but seriously, I want you to think about this from my perspective though, alright. For real, for real, we've known each other forever. We've been together for like over two years, and nothing. Babe, I want to experience us taking our relationship to a new level. You know what I mean? But physically. Just forget I even brought it for now though. Maybe we can talk about it another time. It's whatever. Okay. Okay what? I'll think about it. Like for real. Yeah. No, like for real, for real. Yes, I will think about it. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about babe. Don't get so excited please. What do you mean don't get excited? I didn't say yes, so. Okay, but it's a step. You know what I mean, it's a process. I guess. It's not like I'm trying to rush you into this. Really. I'm not. Like I said, we've been together for over two years.

I've got things I've got to do, okay. Are you gonna give me money for the furniture? You gonna make some money for the furniture? Furniture right there, sit down. Happy birthday. Did we raise farm animals? Tiffany! Be nice. At least she's doing her homework. I'm gonna be nice alright. Tiffany! Im a get Dinner started. I know you didn't leave this mess in here. Tiffany, don't make me come in there. What? What do you mean what? Who do you think you're talking to? Why is my living room so messy? Did you leave this mess in here? Really? I don't know dad, maybe somebody broke in, had a snack, and decided to do my homework for me. Maybe Goldilocks is a college student and thought my studies would be just right. Don't you sass me young lady. You know, I asked your brother to stop by the store and pick up a few things after Bible study. Did he stop in yet? Do you know who else needs to attend Bible study so that they can review the commandment on how to honor their mother and father, so that their days may be long on the earth? That commandment is definitely for parents who actually deserve it. Tiffany. Excuse me? That's enough. Apologize to your father. No, Mom. I'm so sick of his self-righteous bull. You better get your child. Who is it? It's Marquise. Hello, Mrs. Evans. Hey, Marquise. Pastor Evans. Marquise. I thought I would stop by and say hi to Tiffany. I didn't come by at a bad time did I? No, not at all. Come on in. So, how you doing son? I'm fine sir. How's Deborah doing? She's good. She's been working a lot of overtime though lately, so I haven't even really seen much of her as of late, but I'm always thankful for when I do get to see her of course. Amen to that. You know, next time you see her, tell her that I said I hope to see her in church this Sunday. Okay. Both of us. You should come to. I'll consider it. Come on, let's let them have their privacy. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, Marquise. What's wrong? What? Look at Marquise' car. Boy, that boy no good. What, he ain't got no rims? Oh, see that's why he need to come to the church and pray. God don't want him riding around with no rims like that. And his tires, oh they're dusty. Oh he need some help. Help is on the way, what? He just came in and just found that mess there. You don't think he's gonna be mad about that though? But he don't have to come in here yelling like he crazy. It's his house. It doesn't matter, I don't care. Kev, what's up bro? What's up man? How you been? I've been good. Me and my daddy been working down at the church a lot. For the Lord. I feel you. How you been? Ah man, same old, same old. I was over here just listening to Tiff tell me about the drama going on between her and your dad. You know, Tiff is a little throwed off up there. Shut up, Kevin. Yo, you wouldn't believe the craziness that happened to me today. I was just about to tell her, right before you came in. Craziness huh. Yeah. You wouldn't happen to be talking about you getting fired now would you? Jasmine. Of course she did. I remember when you got us fired from that clothing store back in the day. And I was making hundreds of dollars. And then you got us fired from the community service job and that was free. Something wrong with you man. I'm a pray for you. I think you should really look at this as an opportunity to finish writing your book. I think you need to take Tiffany's advice. It's not often that a brain like Tiffany come up with a good idea. Don't you have somewhere to be, Kevin? Like where? Somewhere, anywhere but here. Get get gone. I gotta get going myself, man, I gotta break the bad news to my god mom. Hope she don't kick you out. You ain't got no money either. Well, I can't holler at you about no money. Oh, your birthday, next month right? Yeah. Alright. Why you asking? I just want know, birthday. Alright, Kev. Why are you so weird? I'm getting the man some rims for that little ragged piece of car he got for his birthday. But you could have just told him that. That's not how I roll. We're not in high school anymore, Kevin, grow up. Go to bed. Whatever. Hmm. G'ma. Hello? I'm not working nine to five. This is the book, this is what's suppose to get me. Upon seeing the clear. Stupid. Might as well. Doing. Yo, make a decision, man. Cuzzo, where you at? Quise Oh my gosh, David, when did you get out? Hey, auntie. You're looking good. Life treating you well, you're adjusting okay? I can't complain. Yeah, staying out of trouble? Trying. Uh hmm. Is that a yes or a no? That's a yes. Uh huh, come sit down. Yeah, I've been staying out of trouble, but you know like I know, life could throw you some curve balls. So the key would be to condition yourself to react differently whenever life throws these curve balls huh. Yeah, that's easier said than done. Especially when you been taught out here to survive. You've got to react a certain type of way. It is what it is. You know, I pray for you all the time. And I've never lost faith in you. I appreciate it. Where's the time gone? I wish I could tell you. Oh, I need to get ready for work. Good seeing you, David. Nice talking to you. Hey, make sure nothing happens to him. I got you. I'll hold you to it. Hold me. Sup? What was all that about? Ain't nothing. You ready to go get this bread? I wanted to talk to you first. Here we go. Just listen, alright. I've been thinking. Let's just say God is real. Hypothetically speaking, right. Do you ever get the feeling that he only looks out for certain people? And? For instance, both you and I lost our parents at a very young age, the both of us, right. We went in separate paths, but look at us now. We on the same path. You remember that scripture your mom use to always say? Which one, man? She had a lot. I think it was something like, there's a time to live, a time to die. Oh yeah, a time to laugh and a time to cry. Yeah. Well, my understanding on that is, the only thing guaranteed is death. Yeah. Yeah, so, when that time come, cuz, you better go out with a bang. I mean, I hear you. But do you feel me? I mean, yeah. Hey man, puff your chest up. Bro, let's slide and get this money. Let me see your keys? What you want my keys? 'Cause I said so. You know we gotta switch it up, man. Why you asking all these questions? I think we was gonna take the caddy. When you gonna let me drive the caddy? When you get your paper up. Alright. See you change your mind. Honestly, I feel like I did not have a choice. You always got a choice. You don't understand man. I got so many bills just hanging over my head. Man, you're preaching to the choir. Check it out. I don't know if you heard, but Bird got locked last night. Locked? Police got him on some bogus warrant. He's gonna be down for a little minute. You know me, I don't kick it with nobody like that, so. You know I trust you? I got you.

Oh no. Could I get you anything? No, that's okay sweetie, I had a cup of tea earlier. I'm gonna go ahead and call it a night. Everything alright? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. Nothing you want to tell me? Nothing I can think of. How about the fact that you were fired? Because I thought that we had the type of relationship that was strong enough that you would have thought to let me know about such a thing. Ah, maybe I was wrong. You're not wrong. We do have that kind of relationship. And I did try and tell you afterwords. I came here expecting to tell you, but you weren't here so I just. Hey, don't stress it. I understand. You know, but I want you to know I'm here for you no matter what. And I hope you know that you can come to me and talk about anything. William, come to bed honey, you need to get some rest. Yes, I know love. I've just got too much on my mind to sleep. Well, did you finish your sermon? I sure did. Would you believe I've had this sermon on my mind for a few months now? I've been working on it for a couple of weeks. It is titled The Consequences of Our Actions. Hmm. Can I hear what you're gonna say? You sure can. Hold on, let me get my glasses on. Get ready. Making word, and now let me get comfy. Let me start by asking y'all a question. Have you ever done something? Let me start by asking y'all a question. Have you ever done something that you knew was wrong, but because no one else knew about it, you thought you got away with it? Isn't it funny how we think that God can't see what we do in the dark? We try to rationalize our non-Christ-like behavior. But just because God will forgive us, and Jesus died for that very same reason, doesn't mean that we are exempt for the consequences of our actions. Can I get an amen? Amen. Turn with me in your Bibles to the book of the prophet Isaiah chapter one. We're going to be reading verses 19 and 20. When you have it say it, say amen. If you need a minute, say I need a minute pastor. Need a minute. Is everybody there? Amen. Let's all read it together. If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the lamb. But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken. Now, what this passage of scripture is saying to me, that for every action, there will either be a positive consequence or a negative consequence. Either we are going to eat the good of the land, or we are going to be devoured by the sword. So ultimately it's up to us what we reap, because we're the ones doing the sowing. Didn't God say in Deuteronomy 30 and 19 to choose life? Yes. Weren't we told in Joshua 24 and 15 to choose ye this day whom you will serve? - Yeah. - Amen. Church, God has given us free will. So it's up to us to make a conscious effort to make the right choices. Can I get an amen? Amen. Can God get an amen? Amen. Amen, hallelujah. Praise God, hallelujah. Thank you, amen. Hallelujah. Now, I want you to help me welcome a very special guest. Our own Pastor Hutchens. Thank you, pastor. Since you mentioned consequences, let's stay right there. Do y'all know how many times in the Bible God says he will visit the sins of a father upon his children to the third and fourth generation? So, how did you enjoy the sermon? It was food for the spirit. Thank you. I really needed to hear that. Uh huh. Hey, listen man, I need some advice from you. Okay. Lately, my relationship with Tiffany has become very strained and I just don't know what to do anymore. Hmm. What we wouldn't give to be young again, huh. You know what? You have a very unique way of saying a whole lot without saying much at all, man. It was so good to see you today. Oh my gosh, it's so good to come back. I know, I'm so happy you could make it. What a great message for me to come back to. Oh good. I'll see you ladies later. - Oh okay, bye. - See ya. Mom, can I talk to you for a second? Oh. I'll catch up with you later. Bye sweetie. Um, Marquise is gonna give me a ride home today. Okay, baby. I'll be here helping your father with afternoon services, but we'll be heading straight home after it concludes. Hey love. How you doing, Tiffany? Hi Mr. and Mrs. Norton, how are you doing? Doing great, thank you. Did you enjoy the service? Enjoyed it very much. Great, I'm glad you did. You're getting so big, you look so pretty. Thank you. Have a great day. You too. ♪ Like a bird in the sky I'll fly I am so sorry I haven't been able to come by lately. It's just, work has been so crazy. It's okay, we understand. It just seems that the most we can hope for these days is to break even. I've got 20 hours worth of overtime in this week, and I still very rarely have any disposable income. Trust me, we know exactly what you're going through. Sweetie, why don't you lead us into prayer? Yes, of course. You know, why don't we pray for God's favor over our families and our finances? Dear God, give us the strength to overcome these financial headwinds and continue to look over our family and our friends. And Lord, give us the strength to overcome all adversities, whether it be spiritual, mental, physical, or financial. We thank you. We thank you for all that you have done for us and all that you will continue to do for us. You are the truth and the light. And even in our darkest hours, we're able to see, because of the light that resides within us. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. Amen. How is Marquise doing, Debra? Funny you should ask. Because I have been praying over him a lot lately. And I don't even know why. You know, he would be such a powerful advocate for the kingdom if he decided to give himself to God. I know, I know, but unfortunately, that is still a very sore subject with him. Why is that? Well, you remember his father was killed when he was a small boy. And a few years later, when Sabrina died, it just devastated him. Hmm. And he refused to believe that they were really gone and he thought they were just gonna come back and when that didn't happen, he just blamed God. I thought that when he would grow up, he would think differently. And unfortunately, that hasn't happened, at least not yet. In fact, it's gotten worse. But having said that, I still maintain that once he gets married and has a family of his own to raise, that he'll see the light. ♪ Tell me who could have imagine it ♪ I lost my focus I'll admit ♪ I'm deep in, I'm deep in ♪ Take a step into the danger zone I see y'all hard headed.

Which one was it, 'cause it sure enough wasn't me. Man, whatever yo. Ain't no whatever. Who are you? You know what? I'll tell you who he is. Man, you just big for nothing. Let me ask you something. Have you been smacked by crisp hundred dollar bills, huh? Thought not. Man, get out of my face, man. Move. Forget y'all man. Thought you guys left. That'll be $58.75. Thank you. He'll take care of that. Come on girl, let's go. Hey, wait wait, where y'all going? As far away from you as possible. Look, I ain't go no money to pay for this food. You'll figure it out like you always do... gangsta That'll be $58.75. Didn't you just see me saying I ain't got no money? Well, someone's gotta pay for it. Look, I don't know what to tell you. Hi, may I help you? My name is Tiffany Evans, I'm here for an appointment. Okay. Here's my ID. I actually got a call earlier today, saying that Dr. Singler wanted to see me as soon as possible, so I'm here. Are you a patient of his or is this your first time here? Are you serious? Did I say something wrong? I mean, why would the office be calling me in unless I was already a patient? My bad. I'm new and I'm just trying to figure things out. It can be overwhelming. So sign in right here, have a seat, and Dr. Singler should be with you shortly. Jaz. Tiff? Hey girl, what's up? Hey. What are you doing here? What am I doing here, what are you doing here? We haven't spoke in a while. Uh hmm. Tiff? Okay, let's just say you'll be helping me plan my baby shower. You're baby shower? Yeah. What? Congratulations. Yeah, yeah. Hmm, well no wonder I haven't heard from you since I told you Marquise got fired. Girl, speaking of. Uh hmm. Okay, so listen. I kind of blew your cover a little bit. Of course you did. Listen, I accidentally slipped up and told him that I knew he got fired before he could even tell me. And the first thing he did was blame you. He said "I know Jasmine told you, 'cause she got "a big mouth." You're my girl and he knows it, so whatever. Exactly, that's what I'm saying. And honestly, if it wasn't for you, I don't know what I would know. Marquise doesn't tell me anything. Well, speaking of Marquise, come here. Ugh, what is it now? I hear he's been hustling with his cousin D-Rock lately. Drugs? Tiff, come on. No way. Yes, I'm telling you. And I'm hearing that some other competition has it out for them, so tell him to be careful. Look, I'm only telling you this because you're my girl and you got a nice little situation now. Okay, Ms. Ortiz, I'll see you again in 30 days. Okay, Dr. Singler. And please, make sure to take your medicine as prescribed. Do not skip a dosage. I won't. I learned my lesson the hard way. Okay, now, you take care. You too. See you in a few months for my colonoscopy Dr. Singler. Girl. Ms. Evans. Okay, but listen, I gotta go, but can you wait? I really want to finish this conversation. No, I gotta be somewhere in like 15 minutes. You always have somewhere to go. I just came back to get my phone. Okay, well call me later, I need to see this doctor, but we need to have this conversation. I have a lot of questions for you. I got you. Okay. But don't forget to tell Marquise what I said. Girl, I'm gonna tell him something alright. That's right. Well, the reason we requested for you to come in is because your blood test shows that your RH factor is negative. In all likelihood, your baby's RH positive, unless the baby's father is RH negative as well. Umm, can we simplify this a little bit. What does that mean? Basically, being that you're RH negative, if your baby is RH positive, your blood could mix when you give birth, which would be a problem. What do I need to do next? Can we have the baby's father take a blood test to determine if he's RH negative? If he is then the baby will be, and the problem solved. If he's not, then I'll prescribe you some medication to prevent any problems in the event that your blood and the baby's blood were to mix as you give birth. Me and the father aren't really on speaking terms right now. Is there any other options for me? Then you may have to get what's called an amniocentesis or AM Test done. This will allow us to see if the baby's RH negative as well. The test is relatively safe with very small chance of complications, and it allows to screen the baby for genetic disorders as well. You said a small chance of complications? Yes, but it's nothing to really worry about. Okay. Hey baby. Baby, what's wrong? Nothing. Well, do you want to go get something to eat? Just take me home, Marquise. Now, you know I'm not leaving until you tell me what's wrong, 'cause clearly something's bothering you. I heard you've been doing business with your cousin. Is that why you've been having so much money lately? Who told you that? Does it matter? Look, I've been trying to stack some money up, to build towards having this family that we both want. Okay, so yes, I have been putting in some work with D-Rock. I don't care about the money, Marquise. Well, you need to. You don't remember me telling you. I'm a man. As a man, I have to be a provider. I've seen this story before, so I already know how it ends. With you either going to jail or worse, dead. It's not gonna happen. Listen, Marquise, I'm not even gonna go back and forth with you, okay, but you have a decision to make. It's either me or those streets. But you can't have both. Are you being serious right now? I'm serious. Look babe, just relax, chill alright. I'll tell D-Rock I'm out. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Fine, your makeup about to run. You gonna have your dad mad at me. ♪ Get ready Who's calling me man? Hello? Pastor Evans? Okay, yeah. Yeah, I gotta just stop by the house first. Okay. ♪ Get ready, change is gonna come ♪ He's calling his children to carry ♪ He's calling How you doing young man? I'm doing well. You mind if we walk? Yeah. So tell me man, how's life treating you? Couple of rough patches. Just lost my job the other day. So gotta kind of work on that a little bit. Anything else you want to talk about? Did you watch the game last night? You know I watched that game. Let's go inside and talk about it. Make sure you close that door behind you. Okay, alright. Thank you. Go ahead man, go on and grab you a seat. Pull up a chair. Make yourself comfortable. So, from what I understand, you've been given a unique gift to be able to write some amazing stories. Is that correct? I'm an average writer man, at best. Come on son, don't be modest now. You're gonna make it big one day using that gift that God has given you. And when you, Marquise, you're gonna have a huge platform. Do you understand what that will allow you to do for the kingdom? Hmm? I believe that you been anointed to be able to reach those that society has deemed unreachable. Those who have been born under the same circumstances as you. But first you gotta get right with God so you can be able to be that beacon of light to those still living in darkness. I don't know about that, pastor. I have enough of my own problems to worry about as it is. Well, most times in life, we look for the answers to our problems outward, when the answers reside within us, and those answers come from God. Now, he doesn't always give you what you want, but he always gives you what you need. Why don't you stop by tomorrow and give me a hand around here. All I'm asking for is about six hours out of your day. How much did you make at your last job? I don't want to tell you. Come on, man, try me. $9 an hour. That's alright. I'll tell you what, I'll pay you $10 an hour. If you like the arrangement, you can continue on. If you don't like the arrangement, you're not obligated to continue. That should provide you with some financial help. So you can be able to focus on those God-given writing abilities. You gonna pay me weekly or bi-weekly? Man, I will pay you weekly, bi-weekly, whatever you want. I ain't gonna hold your money now, that's not in the word. You gonna take tithes out of my check? I aint' gonna be taking no tithes, but we will receive your offering. Alright, alright, you have a deal. Deal. Before you go though, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. Okay. How are things coming along between you and Tiffany? Things have been really well. Okay, okay, just asking. She doesn't talk to me much lately. I'm sorry to hear that sir. Son, it's not your fault. Don't worry, you're gonna have kids of your own one day. You know, I'm looking forward to it. But not before you get married, right. I mean, I don't necessarily know what to say to that. You do know premarital sex goes against everything we believe in. Well, alrighty in. Tomorrow at noon. Yeah, ah, yes sir. Sounds good. Thank you though for the opportunity and the conversation. You're welcome. After our conversation, Pastor Evans was very suspicious of me and Tiffany's relationship. Look, um, I don't know how to ask you this, so I'm just gonna cut to the chase. Have you had relations with Marquise? Yeah. And I'm pregnant with his baby right now. Let's just get this over with. Go ahead, tell me how disappointed you are. And how I'm still in college with my entire life ahead of me. And what's even worse, I'm not even married. God forbid an out of wedlock pregnancy because what a scandal that would be when your precious church finds out. And I can hear them gossiping already. Did you hear about the pastor's daughter? How dare you. So, now it's my fault that you're pregnant. If you would have just- If I had been what, Tiffany, huh? When are you gonna grow up and learn to take responsibility for your own actions young lady? Instead of going through life with this woe is me mentality. You probably care more about what the congregation is gonna think than you do about me. What they think and how they feel has always mattered more to you. I've heard enough alright. Now I will always be there for you, but I refuse to be your punching bag. You let me know when you're ready to have a real conversation. Hey, my brother. What's up, Deak. What are you doing on this beautiful Saturday? Man, listen, mind if I sit down? Yeah, have a seat. Have a seat Is everything alright Bill? Hey, Pastor. Hey Evelyn. How are you? I'm doing good, how are you? I'm doing good. Can I get you guys something to drink, water or coffee maybe? No, I'm good, but I appreciate the offer though. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, I'll leave you boys alone. If you need anything, just let me know. Thank you. Is everything alright? You look a little flustered. I don't know, man. I've been fighting a spiritual battle lately. And I'm afraid it feels like I'm losing. But that's impossible. And why is that? Because you are a strong man of God. And that battle that you speak of was won way before it started. And that's where my problem begins, man, Deak, I'm starting to question my calling. But why? I think my pastoral duties are destroying my relationship with my daughter, man. Pardon my candor, but that's ridiculous. I beg your pardon. What you're saying is you believe your calling is a mistake. Maybe. Romans 11:29 says for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. And this is true, but no matter how hard I try, I just can't get through to her, man. You know what? I didn't mean to trouble you. It's no burden. Listen, without a struggle, there could be no victory. Without a test, there could be no testimony. You are a mighty warrior for the kingdom. Which is why I decided many moons ago to go stand with you on that battlefield. You cannot allow the enemy to gain a foothold in your relationship with Tiffany. 'Cause sooner or later, you will lose her. You know what you have to do right? Yeah, I sure do. Thank you my brother. I really needed to hear that. Of course man. Thank you Deak. Alright, I gotta go. Alright. Come here. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I love you so much, more than you'll ever know. It's just that I got so caught up with trying to be everything to everybody else, that I forgot to spend time with you and your mother. I'm here for you. I will always be here for you. But baby girl, I need you to make better choices, okay. Okay, daddy. Alright. You cannot continue to have relations with Marquise unmarried. There are consequences to that, baby girl. Okay, dad. Look at me, I want you to listen to me. If you don't remember nothing else that I say to you, I want you to always put God first, alright. I want you to trust him, I want you to seek him. And he'll never lead you astray. Can you please do that for me? Yes, daddy, I can. Come here. ♪ There I was all alone ♪ A tattered soul, you made me whole ♪ And I want to thank you for your smile ♪ Do do do do Hey baby. Hey, babe. Kev, what's up bro? My brother in Lord. Man, I was starting to think Bible study is canceled, man. Canceled? Yeah. Oh no. I just had to swing by and pick her up. 'Cause when she told me she wanted to come to Bible study, I was shocked.

Nah, seriously though, you got the whole enchilada babe. Seriously. Well, if you love me so much, can you promise to never leave me? Yes, I can promise to never leave you. Awesome. Can you promise the same thing? Of course, I promise. Okay. Unless. Unless what? You tell me I'm the second coolest person you know again. You got that straight? There you go. Hey. Kevin. Sorry about that, I didn't mean to scare you, Ms. Deborah. It's okay. You looking for your buddy? Yeah, where the birthday boy at, where he at? He's still sleeping. I tried to wake him up to wish him a happy birthday. Kid sleeps like a log. You mind if I give it a shot? Have at it. I'm late for work. Alright, you be good now. Goodbye. Happy birthday. What? Wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey. Alright, have it your way then. Happy birthday boy, happy birthday. Thanks man. Oh, I see you went and got taped up huh. Oh, I gotta stay fresh for the Lord. Yes, I do, God is good. All the time. All the time, God is good. Those mine? Yeah, man, they was laying over here on the nightstand man. Matter of fact, what is this? Those are the notes. Book I just started writing again. You back write your book. God is good. Look at you. Wanted to change your life and you're doing it. Working through your book and stuff. Man, and you doing a great job down at the church. Even attending Bible study. I always knew you had it in you. You just had to get out your own way. So you could make it happen. I gotta give you some appreciation though, man, 'cause you always believed me. Oh yeah, give God the glory. Give God the glory. What's up with you though, what are your plans? Oh, I'm just gonna chill today, ain't doing nothing major, just gonna stay fresh, for the Lord. No, no. Longterm, bro. Oh, I'm going back to school. Yeah? To get a degree in theology. Theology? Yeah, so when my father ready to pass the baton, I'll be ready. And in the meantime, I can help him with his ministry. That's good, I could see that for you, man. Oh yeah, God is good. I like that for you. Oh yes. God got us, man. Well, let me get your keys, I'm a go ahead and get out of here. Why, what you need my keys for, what you doing? Man, I'm gonna go get some rims on that raggedy car man. Your car looking bad for your birthday. 'Cause you look like you're struggling man. Look like you don't even know God, the way your car looking. Come on man. You're about to put rims on my car for real? Yeah, happy birthday, brother. You ain't got to do that, man. I know, but once I made my mind up, you know it's final. Kevin decided to stop by the nearest store on his way to getting the rims for my car. You know, it has been fun, but we really do need to get going. What, they closed? Ah man, and this boy's car hot, needs some AC. You're crazy man. Yeah. So what you gonna do? What you mean, what I'm gonna do? Man, what you gonna do, man? What you mean, what do I mean? They done shot your homeboy. I think we just need to let God deal with this man. Let God deal with it? Man, I'm tired of you and this praying. You pray, pray, pray, and you broke. So what you wanna do? You wanna just go roll up on them. You praying and your homeboy in critical condition right now. Have you forgot where we from, huh? We don't pray. We send them to God, and let him deal with it. So, what you gonna do? Huh? Let's go, let's go. Let's go man. So, tell me a little bit about yourself. What brought you down to his place here? Well, they transferred me over here. You know, I'm ready to make a difference, you know. Yeah. Exactly what I use to think. What do you mean? My father was a cop. So of course, it was real important that I became one. 15 years, he gave his life to this precinct. I hardly ever saw the guy. 15 years. Last thing I wanted to do was become a cop. And when I did, all I wanted to do was do the right thing. Yeah. I wanted to do the best I could to clean this place up. You start off well, you mean well. Then you realize that you're not dealing with normal people out here. There all savages. There's no law, no rules. Savages? Yeah, yeah. Hey, y'all didn't tell me your homeboy was a madman. You ready? Ready. Ain't no turning back. I know. Just like the ten commandments. Written in stone. I told him it was the wrong hit, and he still went top busting. Whoa, did you hear that? Yeah, sounded like gunshots. I'm calling it in. No. This is our call. We got this. Police! Hold it right there. Let me see those hands. Both of you. Let me see those hands right now. Let me see those hands or you're dead. That's when I knew I had to turn my life around. D-Rock took the charges and copped out to 10 years, just so I could have a future. Business started booming for Mitch and Tommy. As a result, they all got caught up in sting operation and got 25 years to life for conspiracy. Even Mitch old girl, Diamond, got caught up in it. Kevin survived, but the bullet that hit him in his back severed his spinal cord and paralyzed him from the waist down. Gentlemen and gentlemen, I'm here to talk to you all today about how when you fall, how to get back up. After everything we had gone through, Tiffany and I both realized it was God that got us through it. Lord, I want to thank you for helping me to look past my selfish ways and helping me to mend my relationship with my father. So we both our lives over to him. Dear Lord, I'm asking forgiveness for all my sins, Lord. Soon thereafter, Tiffany and I decided to do the right thing and get married. Do you Marquise take Tiffany to be your lawfully wedded wife, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, as long as you both shall live? I do. Tiffany, do you take Marquise to be your lawfully wedded husband, do you promise before God and these witnesses to love him, comfort him, honor him, and keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others for as long as you both shall live? I do. Now, by the power vested in me, as a minister of the Gospel in the state of Florida, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Marquise, you may kiss your bride. Once the book was done, Pastor Evans hooked me up with a publisher that was a part of his congregation. God bless you, Marquise. Thank you so much. You're welcome. - Take care of yourself. - You too. Oh my god, oh my god. I can't believe I finally get to meet you. I flew all the way over from Amsterdam, and I just got here for the book signing. Wow. My book would go on to sell over three million copies. And within five years, I was able to buy Tiffany that house of her dreams. Hey. Hi, how are you? Good, you guys look very nice. Thank you. You're welcome. How are you doing again? I'm doing very well. Hey baby. Hi. You ready to see this house? Tell your parents it's really nice. Let's go check it out. Come on, let me show you. This house is 700,000 square feet. My goodness. Yes. I didn't even mind when Tiffany would invite Jasmine over. I figured a friend of hers was a friend of mine. Hey, baby. And you overlooked this letter I left for you on the counter. It's from D-Rock. D-Rock? Yeah. Let me know if you need anything, okay? Okay, love you. Love you too. What's up little cuz? You know I'm not into writing these long letters, but I wanted to congratulate you on the success of your book. And I wanted to let you know, because of you, I give up myself to God too. I always knew that the truth resided in him. But man, I was too caught up in these streets, shh, but after a few years of being cased up in here, I was able to slow down and really recognize things for what they were. And it became obvious to me, that I had to turn my life around. By the way, if everything goes right, I should be home in less than five years. Love you, cuz, see you soon.
