The Alm . understand his fascination the obvious but now is not the time . If you can continue the vessel is coated with eel skin . But the slots and tips are reinforced titanium. And the rest of the exoskeleton ? The rest is stainless steel, a pressure -resistant 1024 kPa. It's the best we can do these circumstances. But it is strong enough to overcome the current submarines . It's incredible . - Is . And is ready for action. You what? I have not installed Nero . That had not even water testing.

Admiral we are under attack ! is the Megalodon ! Wait , you're saying it is an attack of the Megalodon ? That makes no sense . There must be another reason Megalodon to attack him . Something must have attracted Shark. Of course he is hungry but is randomly attacking an aircraft carrier ? Captain Trace , which his ship was doing before the attack ? We were testing our emitting high frequency . testing emitters High frequency . Are still testing ? Tell them to stop , it is what is irritating the creature . Captain Trace , are the issuers. Stop the test immediately . Yes , sir Shut off all transmissions now ! Yes , sir . Canceling battle test. I think it worked , Captain . Captain Trace ? Captain ? The connection was interrupted , sir. The lives of over 5000 families of members the U.S.S. James Stuart turned upside down today when the huge Megalodon sank carrier violently. Monetary funds were sent by various organizations and you can see the number in the footer or on our website . Rosie ! Is she okay ? - No . We have to get her out . - Speak! - CVN89 was shot , sir . What? The U.S.S. James Stuart just been slaughtered . All staff was lost . That leaves us in a bad doctor . Because this ship who was shot took the only two riders we trained for this mission . - If you are Rosie ... - Rosie is unconditionally Alm . We may lose a few hours , but who cares ? Jack ? What was Nero? Can I drive alone . That's what I was raised . Someday . Still can not fly alone. Jack , I can do this . Admiral is correct , We can not waste time . Megalodon reach populated areas . Low can be enormous . Nero can fight alone ? Theoretically . - We have a self-destruct ? Theoretically . Nero, the Mecha is yours. but accept my orders . Certainly , Admiral . Thank you . Come on, honey . I'll get her out . Mom . Look at the camera , Olivia . Mom , I do not feel well . Okay dear , Daddy is here. I love you . I'm so sorry , but her daughter is very sick .

Nothing, just one of the moments most terrifying of my life . I have to go back there . It's too late , baby. He was . How so ' gone ' ? Nero is in control . Are you kidding ? He has not been debugged . Was the order of the admiral . He did not think you back in time . It was nothing. I was only half conscious . It was more than that, dear . - You will be fine . I'm worried that 's it. Attention all stations , Mecha approaching the wreckage. I have several large targets moving . Can not say if any of them is the Megalodon . There are no records Megalodon , Lord . Just a moment . Enable eel skin . damage on the rear fin. Problems engine ... submerged Fluctuations detected . - Nero? What 's going on ? I do not know , the computer does not respond . Admiral Megalodon is gone . I am not getting read . Lord , is Dr. MacNeil . Dr. MacNeil ... found something you really need to see . The sooner the better as , Admiral . Can make all the difference . What are you looking at? I threw it away . I'm looking at you , dear . Yes , yes . This fit to travel? Maybe , why? Emma MacNeil wants to see you . I'm free . - Good . I'll prepare the helicopter. SITE EMMA MACNEIL , NEW ZEALAND Dr. Grey , thank you for coming . Dr. MacNeil , is a pleasure . Engleberg said he has something to show me . In fact , I have . To be simple , I managed to track down the Mega ... and I think I know exactly where he is going. Thought TGE was out of the question. Geospatial technology was out of the question , yes it is true . because of the depth the Mega nothing could not scan the ground without seeing the floor . But I noticed something corresponding exactly with the trace Megalodon . Really? The dots indicate Megalodon sightings . Now has something unique in its pattern. sharks generally like ... rotating an area and stay for a while . This path shows us our Megalodon is moving fast . A downward curve . This pattern is unique so ... I was a little curious ... and the temperature sobrepus water with the ocean currents ... and found that ... Our shark is moving in a warm ocean current originated in the Mediterranean ... which appeared first. The trail hits with sightings . Now, I believe the shark will this stream of hot water because he is going forth . Sydney ? There are two million years this territory was Reproduction of Megalodon . How do you know ? A researcher from fossil confirmed . We found literally million teeth of puppies Megalodon scattered in a radius of 16km . Furthermore, the Megalodon probably born here , making this an essential point for him to return . So it is 1.5 km from Sydney ? Yes. It's the closest who came from the coast since the attack the Port of Alexandria. If I were you ... concentrate all I have waters of Sydney because if the Megalodon get there and not find a partner ... He is not happy . No. Given the scale of evacuation how prepared you is to deal with so many people ? We are prepared and trained for all types of situations. Are you saying that the preparation for this evacuation is similar to the preparation for a evacuation after a major earthquake ? Exact. But in this case , if people remain calm, we can evacuate all to a safe location , before the disaster occurs. Thank you, Sergeant Brooks . Back in the studio . And we're off . Thank God ! But that piece of shit . If you are evacuating the entire city , should know who is coming here . It is to keep everything under control . It could get ugly very fast . So tell me doctor ... have a killer fish worth billions of dollars dead ? No. is not dead . only need to recharge energy. But is not making what he should do . Right. What did he do ? Jack ? Jack ? Nero, what happened , buddy ? We lost . I'm in control now . All right , but what happened? Not sure . I'm not used with the system or circuit . Nero ... Write a diagnosis . Overall sequence . Nero? Say the magic word , Jack . - Please . Certainly , Jack . Lord ... Is Dr. Grey . Dr. Grey , that was quick . What? Admiral , Dr. MacNeil said he's going to Australia . Australia ? Confirm this 100% ? Yes sir, I'm going there now . Sure , someone will you find there . He can help us . The meeting point will be there. Can by Jack on the phone ? Hi , dear . I heard right? You are going straight to the port of Sydney . Look, I know you is busy ... - just make sure that ... - I'll be fine , Jack . Will . Love you . I love you too . Lord . This just came . To realign these coordinates. Full - speed . Yes, sir . What? His wife succeeded . We are going to Australia . How is Nero ? I'm operating , Admiral . Yes , all systems are fine. Has a flaw somewhere, but no time to tinker on the motherboard and find out what it is. You are right . Nero, going to Australia . Are sending the coordinates . Understood , Admiral . - The game is tied , Jack . You what? Come on. Come on. - Dr. Grey. How are you ? I was assigned to find him . I am General Hogan . How is the procedure evacuation ? It's been three hours , is difficult. But do our best . We know when the Megalodon be here ? We're not sure . But we know it is near . To be cautious , we have to keep moving quickly . I agree , I have a car waiting for you to take it up there. Thank you. Right this way . Friend, where are we going ? - For the interior , sir . Why? What's going on ? We're not sure , just asked to evacuate all coastal . Keep moving . Lord , Megalodon is emerging . Nero ... take care of it . - Please . Yes , Jack . Miss , I need help. I can not find my daughter . How is she ? It has 1.40 - m . blonde , like me. You're in jeans and a pink blouse. How old are you ? - Has six years Right. Can not have gone far , we seek help . What if ... Let's find her . Seen a little girl ? That time , 6 years ... - His name is Stacey . Sorry , did not see her . Take care , I'll try here . Have you seen a little girl? We're evacuating ! - We leave in 5 minutes! All right , look . I will not go without it ! But , lady ... Stacey ? Stacey ? Her mother is looking for you . You'll be fine . Jack , something's wrong. I see flaws everywhere , you are ... Stacey ! You can not stay here . I know, I know . I'm looking for someone . - I have strict orders . I'm in the Navy , look for a little girl ... Have you seen her ? I just saw you , lady . I'm fine , go ahead. I can not let her ... I've got orders to ... - Look, I know what your orders are . I do not have time to talk . Let her go . So there is no chance him back to the sea ? No afraid he would go to the end . Listen , he knows the area and ... do not think it will go away without a partner . It is a feature of Mega I'm just saying that . So you're saying we a shark 60m needed in our hands ? Yes , basically. Well, on the one hand is a good thing . If we take to a closed area ... we can finish the job . No, listen . Do not have much time , right? What I'm trying to say is that if you do not find a girlfriend this guy soon ... have a very aggressive beast in his hands . Thank you, Dr. Nero? - Come on , buddy . - What now ? There was a lot of damage , I lost all communications . I'll try to fix it. ROBOT MODE ACTIVATED No, it's too late. You do not know , it's worth trying . It's too late. Mecha is entering in robot mode. What do you mean ? What is the robot mode ? What does this mean ? The program has a security against failure . The program allows survival operating alone as a Robot . As a self-guided torpedo. Unfortunately , the program is active . Will do what you gotta do without safety protocols . I can not turn it off . My goodness! This is not good. Come on, something to work ! Come on! I'm going outside . Come on. Let's stop it . Move it , move it! U.S. Navy ! Sorry sir, this area is prohibited . - Not for me . I'm authorized to use force. Truth ? Go ahead . Use the force . Are you the U.S. Navy ? I am . Have identification ? I got a giant robot shark. I guess you did not see . I left my wallet at home this morning . If not let me pass , have a long , long day , friend . Very well . Thank you. Move it , move it! Let's continue ! Keep ! - Jack ! I'm sorry , buddy . What happened ? It's okay . Nero is not responding . So off? No, you're thinking. Thinking ? AMPHIBIOUS MODE ACTIVATED It was the Shutdown button . Why not work? Contact President . What the hell is this? Had time to deploy an amphibious mode. is she Stacey ! Stacey Stacey ! Nero, you hear? Nero , disarm yourself ! He can see that they are human ? - The protocol was already . There is nothing we can do. The President will my resignation the morning ... but now , we have a job to do . Excuse me . Excuse me . What Nero is doing ? - Nero Nero is no more . Jack ! Rosie ! Rosie ! I'll be back ! It will be okay . Get in! That's my girl. Okay , go . Go, go, go . Put the belt . Pisa background, dear . Where are we going ? - For the city . What? - Have you ever seen anything like this before ? No, never . Do not move. Turn on the camera . Dave ... Dave , lower the camera. Come on, quick ! Holy shit ! We need to return and try to fix. - Hello? - Dr. Grey, who find it good . you okay ? I'm fine, thanks. I got an urgent call for you. Okay, thank you . Hello? Rosie , there you are . What is happening ? I saw the news , is a zone . Let's just say that the Mecha is no longer on our side . You know, I think if you could ... take it back to the ocean and ... My God , I do not know ... Alright . The Mega is there to play , right? Then he will see any male as a threat . Right ... Well, listen ...
