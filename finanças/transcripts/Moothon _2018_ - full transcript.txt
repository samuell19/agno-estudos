[...O, jasmine scented breeze, come...] [...tell me the tale of the almighty one's gift...] [...Moons ago, Sulekha Beevi turned pink...] [...as she blushed with a coy smile...] Mulla! Come, let's go! It's tied securely, right? Yeah. Let's go. Yeah, hop on. Come on, push! What now? I've told you not to come asking for the kids, right? Look at you, tattered clothes and what not? I better not see you around here again. You're nothing but a bad influence on them. How dare you walk off when I'm talking? - Been trying to act smart, huh, whimp? - Get off me! Here's how you ought to dress up. Run, run! Stop dreaming and help me. Take that and catch some fish. You won't have to do this much longer. Your aunt will come and take you with her. I've become a burden for you, haven't I? Nice try. You pull this trick every time she comes. Only a woman can take care of you at this age. I want to get out of here. I want to find my big brother. You can't be like him just by wearing his clothes. Did he ever bother to check on you? What does he think? That I'll take care of you forever? He didn't even come when your mother died. - That's because no one informed him. He won't be found because he doesn't want to be. Everyone changes on reaching the mainland. Everyone. Is he in Bombay? I don't know, nor do I care. Are all the stories about him true? Everyone loves a good fairytale, don't they? He was a smart man, like your father. Everyone used to love watching him perform 'kuthu ratheeb.' Then, why did he leave? Was it Aamina's curse? I don't know any Aamina. The only Aamina I know is the 3 foot long, succulent fish. Almost impossible to find. Akbar once caught it... ...but he let it go. Hit him! Hit him! Look at this boy's face. I've had it. Always up to no good. I don't think Moosa can take care of me anymore. I really feel my brother's absence now. Moosa gets irritated whenever I mention him. I will definitely find my brother. Where will you search though? He went missing in the sea, right? How are you sure he's even alive? I heard he left this island heartbroken. He's not the kind of guy who would leave this island because of a failed relationship. Exactly! There was no one like him in the 'madrassa.' He cured my grandmother's illness by performing 'kuthu ratheeb.' She passed away as soon as he left. Do you remember his face? No. There are a few photos of him, but none of those are clear. Only Aamina's face is recognizable. Is that why you've been asking around for her number? Isn't she in Bombay? It's a huge city. How will you get there? They don't sell tickets to kids. Swimming there is an option. I can take our boat. The tide will take me there. What if it takes you to China? I heard they eat kids there. Where is he? He must be stuck somewhere. He said he got Aamina's number. What will you ask Aamina? Will you get straight to the point? I'll tell her I'm coming to Bombay. You need money to survive there till you meet her. We can catch some fish and sell it. One good catch will fetch us good money. There he is! How much do we owe him? We'll sort that later. Let's get the number first. Here's the number. Where's my money? Umm... Give us a few days. We'll pay you first. Don't try to fool me, okay? You lot will come to me asking for help again. I'll set you straight then. Add some more masala. - And end up crying like last time? Flip it. Isn't it time to go home? Go home! I said, go home! Why are you shouting? You guys are bad influences! Go now! Let's go. -He's getting riled up for no reason. What did you say? - Nothing! Go! Why'd you ask Bakker for Aamina's number? How many times have I told you not to go searching for your brother's stories? It's all my fault. I should have been more strict with you. Don't you dare pull such stunts again. This is your last warning. Incorrigible kids, Moosa. What can we do? Our hands are tied. We've reached the Mumbai dock. We'll be out in a half hour. So, get ready. Who the hell peed in the pan? - Will your mom clean this up? - Hey, shut up! Throw this guy out! Bloody addict. Give me a cigarette! Give me a bloody cigarette! Is anyone listening? Shall I throw you in there as well? Are you guys dead? Step back, kid. He's intoxicated. He'll tear you apart. I want to go home. I want to go home. What? - I want to go home! - I want to go home! Sit down. Greetings. My name is Prasanth. This is our orphanage's warden. You told me about a child over the phone. Oh, yes. It's that one sitting there. Oi, you! Decided to bathe after all, huh? Are you going to bathe with your clothes on? You see that drawing? It's my work of art. Are you not understanding what I'm saying? Here, you want a soap bar? Towel? A hot kiss? Did someone mess with you? I didn't do anything. That kid tried to kiss me! Didn't like the people here? Didn't like me? Come on. Take it off. Take it off. I said, take it off. Run, run! Hey, stop right there! You lot, get back here right now! Did he touch you? Tell me. Do you want to escape from this place? My mother... She's the heroine of Kamathipura. She loves me a lot. The cops forcefully brought me here. They said she's not capable of taking care of me. But, she's badass. Mother? Rosy. Kamathipura is close by. Kamathipura... Hey! Close the gate! Security! Close the gate! Stop him! Hey, catch the ball! Catch the ball, man! He can't even catch a ball! Hey, nuthead! Never played cricket before? At least pass the ball! Got money on you? Rosy? Rosy... Oi, Rosy! Rosy! Who is so excited about me? What? Raju... Come upstairs. Raju sent you here? What's your name? Are you dumb or do you not understand my language? Raju. Come. You sneaked out of the children's home, didn't you? Look at your clothes. It's all torn. Sit! You know the rules, Rosy. Bhai decides what goes on in Kamathipura. Leave that to me. Let him work here. I know how to handle Bhai. I'll fine you 5 rupees for every broken glass. - Take your hands off. -What? - What's your name, punk? - Take your hands off. What's your name? This is our area, got it? Our area. Check his pockets, he might have money! I'll kill you if you take my money! Altaf! Hey, Altaf! - Yeah, mom. - Let go of him. Mom, he's trying to act smart in our area. Scram! We're not done with you. You'll bump into us soon, alone. You're dead meat. Get the hell out of here! I don't want kids from pigs like you. What now? Those guys stole all of my money. I don't understand your gibberish. I work here. - I was saving it to make a call! - Closed door means open for business. And open for business means - I don't want to see your face around here. - I don't even have enough money to eat. Yeah, me too. Greetings, Bhai. You sure no one's searching for him? He's from the island. Island? You're from the island, little one? So, you're Bhai's breed, huh? Isn't that right, kid? Aw, you're whining? Hey, doggy. He'll fetch us an easy 50,000 in the market. He's a wild one though, huh? Tell me, shall I strike the deal? First, we have to tame him. Tell Babu Chapri that we will deliver him soon. What about the advance amount? Not yet. Relax. Relax. Peace be upon you, brother! Yes... What do you want? Where's the money? What money? - Drop the act. - I haven't received any call about money. Make the call, then. What's up, birdie? Bhai has sent Salim. He's asking for the cash. What should I do? Alright. I'm giving you the cash only because the boss told me to. When will the boy be delivered? He's a wild one. He needs to be tamed. Leave. What are you doing here? You thought you could get away from me, punk? Good that you've tied him up, Bhai. He deserves it. Hey. Let go of him. You're lucky Bhai told me to let go of you. Meet me alone, I'll shove a bat up your ass! And turn you into a popsicle! Oi, out, out. I won't spare you, punk. It's only Bhai's word that saved you. Hey, Rosy! Rosy! Your boy is in our hands now! Piss off! Idiot. Sultan. Here, take this. Did those jokers pay up? Count it. I need more stuff. How much do you smoke a day? Have you seen your eyes? Red. I'm busy, come back later. I won't repeat myself, you halfwit! Try the next door. Let go. Where's the kid, woman? Tell me or I'll wring your neck. You heartless halfwit. You left that kid starving. You're one to talk, woman! Your own son is in that gutter now. Your kid's rotting on government funds! Get the hell out, you fool! Leave or I'll cut you up! I don't have money right now. Can I pay you later? What are you saying? Phone? No. Go, go. No money, no phone call. Can I... I don't know. Now, go. I warned you not to mess with Bhai and his boys. They're looking for you. Stay away from here for a while. Where the hell were you? Tell me. Say something! He's been acting smart. Tell Bhai we found him. Run. Tell me, punk. Hey, doggy. Say something, doggy. If you're Mr. India, I'm Baazigar, boy. Come, let's party. What did you think? That we wouldn't be able to find you? There's a lot of money riding on you, kid. Hey, Pikku! Back off! Not bad, kid. Let's see what more you got. Salim, Yeah, Bhai? Get the lamb. He won't do it. Hold the knife! Yeah, like this. Hold the knife... and kill it swift; halal. Any other way; haraam. Man up and chop! Hold the knife properly! Let's see what you're made of. Chop! Slash its neck! Quick! Do it! Don't test me! Hey! Now, you're one of us. Catch. If you can't keep your hat on, don't bother putting it on. Leave it to the ones who can keep it on. Who are you searching for? My big brother. He lives here? I think so. He came here years back. That's why I'm here. Long back... Years ago... A swine came here from the island. I saw him struggling here doing odd jobs. His body was full of scars. When nothing was working for him, He started doing all kinds of things to survive. The cops nab him from time to time. When finally, he... ...he came to me a defeated man... ...I finished him off myself. A nobody. If you want to survive these streets... ...you're going to need to learn some tricks. I'm going to teach you everything, kid. Come here. Come here, you! Aamina? Aam... Aamina? Hello? Trying to call your girlfriend? Don't call girls, do something productive. Here you go. Let's go. Oi, let's go. Let's go! Balli! Balli! Greetings, Bhai. We need more stuff. Did you talk to Karim Bhai? What talk? Just give me the stuff. This kid here, he's going to handle it this time. What if he gets caught by the cops? He doesn't understand Hindi. Go, get the stuff. Hey! I didn't take it seriously when Salim warned me about you. That's why I let you be. Give me the money. Who are you calling with my phone? Give me the phone. Let go of me! Let go! I came here looking for my brother! You and your fake stories! I'm not lying! I came here looking for my brother! I came looking for Akbar! What did you say? I... I came looking for Akbar. Let go! You? I... I'm Akbar's sister. Your name? Mulla. Apply it on your face. For your information, this is not a fairness cream. Get lost. Aamina, do you remember his first performance? Of course! He fainted seeing his own blood. I see your brother has come down. Is he getting married? Yeah, if he agrees this time, that is. - Go home, it's late. - Okay. Let it dry on the wound. Don’t jump into the sea right away. Even that deaf and mute idiot is getting a bride. He’s not deaf. He’s a mute. Would I also have to go to Bombay to get a bride now? Did you see him? He was there at the performance. I didn't notice him. He looks completely different now. Don’t you remember him? That timid guy. We used to bully him. Not we, just you. True, I bullied him a lot. Once, I kept him in a corner till he peed his pants. I hope he doesn’t remember any of that. He's all muscular now. You coming for a swim? No, you carry on. As-salaamu alaykum. Wa alaykumu s-salaam. - You arrived today? - Yes. I saw you performing. It was beautiful. Do it again. I didn’t get it. Your performance… I saw it. It was amazing! You liked my performance. Isn’t it? Exactly. How do I say "thank you" in sign language? Thank -- you. Thank you. There we go. Aren’t you going back? Yes, soon. Did you learn this sign language in Bombay? Yes. No one here understands anything I say. No one understands what you're saying? Is that what you meant? Yes. I'm understanding it all. Yes, you are. Let the kids talk. The rest of you can come with me. I've been learning Hindi. Does everyone in Bombay understand your sign language? No, you have to go to a special school for that. You'll teach me? Isn't that what you said? What's wrong? Mother! Aamir! Aamir! This is not the first time he’s fallen down like this. I have a feeling someone has voodooed him. Feeling better now? He’s saying his throat is dry. I understood. You can’t drink water tonight. Give him this drink. There's something troubling him. Can you come tomorrow and help him out, Akbar? Can I come along with you guys? - You want to come with us? - Yes. We won’t be back by nightfall. Plus, it'll be a mess if you get seasick and puke. Can you swim well? Of course. As swift as a fish. I don’t smoke. Try it. Are you guys not coming? We'll come in a while! You go. I’m good here. - You’re not coming? - Not anytime soon. Why not? I’m happy here. Is there such beauty in Bombay? Of course! It's magnificent. Really? Like, the sunset is just as beautiful. I've heard there are a lot of pigeons there. Countless numbers. From my window, I can see them all flying around. Is it? I see them the moment I wake up every morning. I wish to see Bombay at least once. I’ll take you there. I’ll show you Bombay. - You'll take me there? - Yes, I will. What is it? I don’t want to get married. Hmm. No one understands. What does that mean? No one listens to me when I say I don’t want to get married. I've been trying to tell them repeatedly. They don’t understand you, huh? It's bloody frustrating! - Can I ask you something? - Hmm? That night, when I saw you performing… didn’t you notice me? That night, at your performance, our eyes met. Or, was it just me? Are you just going to sunbathe all day? You haven’t caught a single fish. Give me some more time. The season has just begun. You expect the fish to just jump onto the boat for you? Get yourself a nice tan. I’m off. Hmm. Give her a break, Akbar. She'll run out of breath. Stop it, Akbar. You're spoiling this child. Giving her the strangest of names! Have you ever heard of a girl being named 'Mulla' on this island? What’s wrong with her name? It's the name of the most beautiful fragrance! Where's Aamina? Haven’t seen her around today. The entire family has gone to Kochi for wedding shopping. They'll be back tomorrow. [...When a coin fell into knee deep water...] [...girl, you bent down and picked it up...] [...without getting your clothes wet...] [...Cumin, turmeric, coriander...] [...and all the other spices...] [...were mixed very well by you...] [...and powdered on a stone, girl....] [...When a coin fell into knee deep water...] [...girl, you bent down and picked it up...] [...without getting your clothes wet...] [...Cumin, turmeric, coriander...] [...and all the other spices...] [...were mixed very well by you...] [...and powdered on a stone, girl...] I thought you went to Kochi as well. I didn’t want to go. You're shivering. Are you feeling cold? Does it hurt? Not anymore. There is no one home. I'm not able to get a hold of myself. The pain... ...of the knife piercing my gut... ...I felt it for the first time. Whatever's distracting you is not for your good, Akbar. Aamir, stop messing around. I have lots to do. Stop! Moosa! Moosa, leave him! Moosa! Why are you hitting him? Please stop this! Let go of him, Moosa! Moosa, tell me what's wrong! If I ever see you with Akbar again... ...I’ll slaughter you. Get lost! Aamir… Get lost, you fool! Rot in hell! Aamir... Why are you so quiet? No reason. Aamina and her mother are extremely upset... ...about what happened today. What happened? Like you don't know. I said, what happened? Moosa thrashed him. Where is he? Akbar, leave. I said, leave. Aamir! Akbar... Aam... Come with me. Aamir! Akbar! Kondotty festival is around the corner. We need to start preparing for our performance. I’m not performing this year. You don't get to decide that! You can't always have your way. Did you care to think about me? It takes years to build a reputation... ...and only a second to lose it. What's your point? You're already dead set on destroying everything. Why did the rest of us have to work so hard? How are you capable of being so selfish? That too, for what? I don’t know. I don’t know anything anymore. Is that all you have to say? Is this all for that fellow? People are saying all kinds of things. I don't give a damn. As long as my friend is not a part of it. I thought at least you'd understand. Akbar. Akbar. He’s getting married in two days. Please let him go. At least for the sake of your little sister. I give my daughter Fathima’s hand to you... ...as your wife with this 1001 rupees. I accept. I accept. I accept. Come with me to Bombay. We talked about my house, remember? You wanted to see Bombay. You told me, remember? I promised to take you there, remember? Let’s go. Say something! Why are you not saying anything? We can see the pigeons together from my window. Hundreds of them! The beach is also just as beautiful. Remember? We talked about it! The sunrise and sunset... ...we can see it, together. Please! Please come. Say something! Let’s go! I have a request. I want to say your name... ...at least once. Just once. A... a... a... K... k... Ba... r... You called for me? How did you get here? In a ship. A ship? Did you come alone? Do you always dress like a boy? Won't your family be looking for you? I have no one. Where's your mother? She's no more. Stay here till I'm back. Can you help me find my brother? I have a number. Aamina's number. I'm sure she knows where he is. So, you won't help me? I can't let her stay with me. I live a very different life now. This dance bar is run by my husband. We have a daughter as well. Figure something else out. Please don't come asking for help again. Hey! Get down here, we've got work to do! That halfwit must be asleep. I'll go upstairs and check. What's the hurry, playboy? Get lost! How dare you peep? I ought to... Get lost! I said, get lost! Why are you so concerned about that kid? And, what do you think? That, if I shut shop, people will wait around for me? I'm not that special. You're more special than you think, Rosy. Fine, send him over. It'll cost you though. [...On the pages of my eyes...] [...I had written it a thousand times...] [...The love that was evident on paper...] [...could not be brought out in words...] [...That I'm your hero...] - Pikku? The others are all frauds. [...Stop right there...] [...Stop right there, you...] [...Oh, my sexy...] [...give me a look...] - [...My heart beats for you...] - Let go! What's happened to you? You're in love, aren't you? Huh? It's love, isn't it? Come on, tell me. I'm your buddy. Your bro. You're no one's friend, you moron. Oi! Shut up and tell me. What's your problem, man? What problem? Tell me the lucky girl's name. Say it. You're all dressed up. Something's brewing. Huh? Swear on Rosy. Get lost! Open the door, Salim! She's just a kid, show some mercy! Just a kid, man. Zip it and get lost! Bhai won't spare you! Yeah, right. Bhai can't do anything to me! Salim, listen for once. Bhai will kill you, I swear! Shut up. Don't mess around. Don't mess around, I'm warning you. What are you looking at? Is she your kid? Yeah, she is. - Oh, really? She's your child? - Yeah, she is. Now, let her go. - Hey! - Back off! - Leave the kid alone, please. - Who is she to you? - Salim, let go of her. - Don't make a scene. - Salim! - Get away from here! You bloody pimp! Everyone's watching, stop! Listen to me! Listen! - What are you doing, Salim? - Get lost. Lock the door. - Lock the door. - What do you mean? Lock the door, lock the door, LOCK THE DOOR! You'll never learn. Bhai! Salim... Salim has set out to sell Mulla. Salim! You double-crosser! What have you done? Bhai, it's only chloroform! What have you done? Mulla! Wake up! It's only chloroform! Bhai, I didn't do anyth... Stand back, I have a knife on me! I'll shove that knife up your butt, you fool! Come in. Sit down. I need your help. My younger sister found her way here. She came in search of me. Could you... Could you take care of her for two days? You came here for her? Don't pull me into this mess again. My business has taken a hit looking after this kid. Do you know how much money I could have made by now? Come. You're going to sell her off anyway. Don't give her hope. Who is this? He was my first friend in Bombay. I don't want to stay here. I'll come get you soon. You never listen. That's your problem. Listen to me for once. You've always said, "Salim..." "Keep it simple. Keep the plan simple." You're simply getting all riled up over this kid! I don't get it, I... What do I say? I just really want to... Get out of the car. Bhai, has this kid cast a spell on you? How much does he owes us? Ten thousand bucks, boss. It was that kid's fault, boss. I swear, ask Balli. Bhai, I told you not to trust that kid. Boss... Give me a big one. These small-time jobs are no fun anymore. I'll repay everything in one shot. You bloody addict. You're out of your senses half the time. Why give me a bigger headache? I'm too busy to clean up after you. Can we... get a minute, boss? If I mess up again... My throat... Your knife. You need to deliver a consignment. I'll do the arrangements for the job myself. All you've got to do is pick up a middleman who will then direct you. You'll need around 15-20 people. It's a game of millions. Balli will give you a gun for your safety. Return it once the job is done. Can... Can we get two guns? For everyone's safety? There's no need for guns. Who should I deliver the money to? You know the kind of people who live here? The ones who act in films. The famous people who act in films? Like Amitabh Bachchan. It was a simple set of words. All you had to say was... ..."Boss, give me a gun. "Boss, give me a gun..." If you didn't want it, I would have held onto it. I would have happily held onto it. Why'd you have to act all heroic? Why didn't any of you say a word back then? Shaking your heads now won't help. - Bloody bobbleheads! - Oi, stop barking! I wish I could, Bhai. Salim's right, Bhai. I will gouge your eyes out! Shut up! Oi, he's talking to you, idiot. My God... Shit, Bhai! COME AT ME, YOU IDIOTS! What the hell is happening, Bhai? Why are you trying to get us killed? I'll kill you! I swear I will! You're finished! I swear, you're finished! You nitwit! Bhai, careful! What did I tell you? Huh? What did I tell you? It's all gone! The money, the stash, everything! I warned you! It's all these idiots' fault! It was a bad move, Bhai! We're finished! Do you remember what you told me long back? You told me you're my big brother. They thrashed me like a dog. Like a dog. I can't even take a dump anymore. Get up. I said, get up. While you've been stuffing your nose with this stuff, I've been getting beaten up. Those savages. ... And you did nothing about it. What do I do about you? Tell me, what? Come on, tell me. Half of me wants to leave you bleeding to death here! I got thrashed and you got stoned! The boss will kill me! I don't want to die. I don't want to die! I don't want to die, you swine! I don't want to die, you hear me? There's no use in saying my name! You got me into this mess! You used to say I'm your brother! Brother my foot! I know your kid's a girl, not a boy! You've lost your mind, Bhai! It's a bloody girl! Can I give you some advice? You've got to stop dressing up like boys. It's a trap. Isn't it better to live according to what others think? How about some make-up? Let's start with some lipstick. Fine, at least a bangle then. Yeah, that'll look pretty. Let go! Let go! There we go, it fits. Let go of me! Hear me out, boss. We said we'll definitely return the money, right? What's my fault in this? I'm telling you, the delivery will be made, boss. You just handle Chapri. Cut it out! Let go of me! Let go! Calm down, man! It's good there. We'll get all of that there. Take this. Nothing to worry about. Fill it up slowly. Hey, brat! Hey, it's Salim. Chapri has asked for you. Come with me or I'll whack you deaf. Salim, back off. What do you want? Piss off. - Salim, stop it. - What's wrong with you, man? Let go of me! I feed all you swines! - So, back off! - Let go of her! Get up, Mulla. You hit me? We're screwed. You dared hit me? You thankless maggots! After everything I did for you! Fools! Salim! - Where's the kid? - Bhai, too late! She's been sold off! Stop, you... Hey, Salim! You can't run from me! Salim! Salim! Salim... She's my own blood. My sister. Speak! Speak... Allah... Oi, did you not get it the first time? I said, come later! Hey, who's at the door? I'm paying extra for you, babe. Come back in. Have you gone deaf?
