The Bratski Krug, known as the Circle of Brothers, an international drug cartel created with guns and blood. The man behind the empire, Joseph "The Shark" Salazar, also it is known as The Great White Shark. Colombian half, half Russian. He married the daughter of the head of the Circle. The rise of Salazar left many dead bodies on their way to the top ... The work we have done I think it needs a firmer basis than ever to face the inevitable challenges we face in a context of evolving threats. Because we know that this challenge will evolve, and requires a fast and flexible response by the federal government and other organs throughout the country. The police are fighting a war which it should have been declared. This war has harmed innocent people. Instigates crime and violence in the streets ... Crimes against private property, depleting our resources. - Criminals ... - This is an epidemic ... The crack epidemic in New York is now out of control. Mayor Koch sought help from the federal government in the fight against drugs and he requested the death penalty for drug traffickers. De Independent News informa, Ed Miller. Holy God. Federal Agent Tom Jensen As you know, we are in what is considered American soil, so their responses are subject to our laws. You should tell the truth. Do you understand, right? Yes sir. I read their statements. The Department of Justice he asked his team to do what he thought was routine transportation. But in the last 24 hours there were several casualties. A Marshal, an agent of Defense, one of immigration, not to mention the disappearance of the head of Bratski Krug, Joseph "The Shark" Salazar. Obviously, in their statements there are numerous omissions. And I'd understand if, now, I can get clarification respect. Are you aware of the circumstances that led to that day? Skony, had not informed me, sir. Welcome to Missouri. Agente Federal John Skokowski alias Skony Well, allow me to me, now. I'm sure you've heard of Operation Salazar. I extend a federal team trying to dismantle the Bratski Krug And capture Joseph "The Shark" Salazar, for more than 5 years. Tell me, did I ever tell you how I escaped the Russian army through Afghanistan in '91, and finished as the father of Larisa hit man in Odessa? Only every time we play chess.

Hands up, do it. We reviewed the outer zone, there is no one. Get him out of here. No... You will go directly to jail. Idiot. Well, I will review the dead. Well, this is the last. And it is also the end of "The Shark". Derol agent that day and I took that son of a bitch. Now, will you tell me about Barada? With all due respect, sir, everything is in my file. Yes, good... as I said, my job is not to read his file, but talk to you, those things I have already read. That's why I'm here. How he ended up in the JPATS? I was recruited, sir. ¿Por John Skokowski? He was a good man. Yes sir. Okay, back to Barada for a minute. What do you want to know? 3 trips, the last of which with Barada. I arrived home half dead. Annoy some people along the way, people do not know what we do outside our country. Certainly, you understand, sir, to avoid jail I will not say another word. It will not end up in jail. Do you think I'm here to arrest him? No sir. TRAININGS CENTER AGENTS FEDERAL - KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI Time zero nine zero zero 9:00 ¿Mayor Tom Jensen? - That's me, Major. - You're late, Jensen. I introduce myself at 9, I'm early. I give a shit about your imaginary numbers. You're late. Well, come on, move. Get your stuff. Welcome to Missouri. My pleasure, sir. Come on, come on, come on. Holy God. Hurry up, come on! Fourteen zero zero hour 14:00 He came Barada transferred from the unit. Fantastic. Another crazy deranged. Expect. Everything we do, we do as a unit. So we return home safe and ready for the next mission. - Is not that right, Mayor? - Yeah, it sounds good to me ... Mayor. damn fool. Eighteen zero zero hour 18:00 Like everything we do, with this exercise is timed. You have 11 seconds to shoot six goals. It is a condition for qualifying. Ready, Major? 11 seconds. 9 seconds. 5 seconds. - You had a long time for the latter. - More than I needed. Is there a specific reason? Honestly, sir, if I have trouble shooting a beautiful woman. - Try to keep up. - I'll do my best. You know, no time limit to run well. Really? What are we waiting for? Federal Agent: Eric Ramirez Federal commission: Gary Dentze Federal Agent: Amanda Chavez The Justice Department just contact us, we have to transport a prisoner to Constanta, Romania. The DEA brings a body on board, but have large bureaucratic problems. They ask us to take care while they manage. For a corpse? It sounds like the typical nonsense DEA. They cast under a plan in general terms and then finally not give them to us. According to the record, the body in the bag is a certain Joseph Salazar. - - Exacto. - Do you know the Circle of Brothers? - They are the same thing. Salazar was the head of one of the most violent cartels in Eastern Europe. Dead or alive, we will take you to the United States. Prepare to leave. What are you waiting for, soldier? Come on. Snoky, informed the team before leaving, right? The best he could. Did he never intimated that he was aware of the true nature of the mission? No sir. Does anyone questioning team orders? No sir. Constanta, Romania AMERICAN TRANSIT POINT, MK AIR BASE I did idea if the Marshal had obtained approval Skony to fly in foreign territory a US aircraft to transport prisoners? This is beyond my competence. the transfer of prisoners to the hotel was not authorized. Listen, sir, we were told that this operation was as a favor to the DEA. Communication came from the headquarters of the DEA in Washington. See the file. Snoky was only following orders, sir. higher orders. - Death. - Darol. I appreciate your help at the last minute. Yeah, well, we are far from home, so let's get to the point. As you like. Luca. Ramirez. - Allow me, girl. - You too, Jensen. What the hell ...? - What the fuck does this, Darol? - My friend, this means free. Salazar will be our star witness for the following 10 years. All you have to do is just take it to US Will he changed sides and abandoned the family? Does he know that the Circle is trying to destroy all his descendants? Try, yes. He will be successful? Of course not. In addition, only he and his wife Larisa. Not my problem. I care only carry the good US All are surprised to see me still alive. Yes, definitely so. Especially you, little girl. Is supposed to be handcuffed for transport, you know. We must take care of him for 24 hours before being transported. Listen, the order came from above, okay? We have to take care to give the green light. Since when the US Marshal became a damn babysitter? These were no transport orders. Damn, Derol. I should have known it was a load of crap across the Atlantic. Skony, what do you want from me? Hey? The Justice Department made a deal with Salazar. The DEA asked him to pretend his death, not to arouse suspicion his men, or the plan change drastically. They say we care until they give the green light. So take care to give the green light. I need you to give me 24 hours. Then we can put him behind bars for the rest of his life. 24 hours. We have no safe cell. What you must do is get him on that military base there and keep it locked up in solitary confinement. Is a lot of paperwork, okay? I can not leave on a base with 8,000 soldiers, anyone could be bought. Agree? I have a safe place. You'll love it. But I heard a name. Yes? What was the name? Hey, talk to Harrison ... Yours, sir. Fuck, Derol. Vamonos. Give me a cigarette, I've been dead for more than four hours. No way. In your world, when someone steps on your feet, you have to be nice ... In my world... Just remember, you're supposed dead, do us a favor and acts well. Jensen. I got this. Mamaia, Rumania Baja. I had never been before holiday to Romania. It is not too late to start, huh? Ramirez, Luca, revise the west staircase. Dentze Revisa este la escalera. Jensen, Chavez, come with me. - Floor 12? - Presidential Suite. Only the best for the year rat. According to the Chinese, people born in the Year of the Rat are creative, intelligent, honest, ambitious, generous and temperamental. Do you see it? No, I'm not a rat, I'm a shark. What I care a rat shit? Electricity? There is a generator that powers the suite and the elevator. Everything else is dark or without electricity. - The staff? - Sent home. Plumbing problems in the foundation. They have been drilling drainage tunnels in the last 6 months. Good for us, but ... a good place to put someone on hold transport. Who else knows we're here? Harrison only. Look at this view ... You know how much it costs me this beautiful view? 3 million US dollars. It is the money you leave in Odessa. I think you know a lot about the family ... - Oh yeah? - Your father... I believe that... It was a big influence on your life. I am right? For me, it was my father who made me the man I am today. You know what he said? "Do not fuck with the big dogs". Good advice. Good story. It's funny because I was born in the year of the rat and I give a damn dogs. Salazar, your room is upstairs. Come with me. Okay, it's all yours. I have to hurry to prepare for tomorrow authorization, but be sure to check and that no one at the hotel knows we're here. My men have been awake for 72 hours, so why not ... tomas a Luca. All right. You'll be alone tonight, but I'll return with the authorization, and keep your team in position at 9. We are just 6. You expect us to ensure the entire floor with that? Skony, there are only two ways to add it here. The elevator and stairs, either east or west. okay? You can defend with three men. Come on, relax. I say, bad think that Salazar is dead. Nobody knows that we are here. It's an easy job, just stay the course. OK, listen up. This place is now considered hot zone. If something happens to me, Ramirez takes over, you know? Jensen, Chavez, you do the first review. Luca, you and Ramirez, check the elevator and stairs. Both are in the hallway. Dentze, you stay here with me. Concentrate, fellas. 20 hours and we will be in the air again. Did not it odd that Darol leave unescorted? After my experience in Afghanistan ... No sir. If you move, you die. I'll call you later, honey. You speak English, what is your name? Emilian, head of buttons. 47 years. I have worked in several luxury hotels around the world. Good for you. What are you doing here, Emilian? I try to cure cancer. What the hell do you think I'm doing? I am resting. I smoke a joint and I talk to my wife. No one told me that security had changed, they should tell me that shit. I have a fucking gun in your face and imbeciles moneybags who pay my salary They do not tell me anything, and then they fired me for not knowing. Veras, not supposed to know that you're here, Emilian. So I'll be good to you. Well, I went wrong, because I know you're here, I'm watching you. I was on my break and I smoked a joint, and ... I tides, Emilian. Listen, I'll tell you what, okay? Dale one last puff, then enter and I will not tell those morons who get paid the salary you do. Agree? What are you waiting? Here we go ... Is it good? Yes? - You have a good day. - Thank you. Have you reported this to Skony? No... No. Is Chavez informed his supervisor? - No sir. - Why not? Take a decision. I did not see it as a threat. He was a civilian and I let it go. And how did he know? Good shit. Do you smell grass? So smell the grass? Strange... You do not trust me, right? Smelled marijuana and saw the Marshal Jensen coming from abroad. Check the area and found traces of marijuana cigarettes. You really going to screw up so fast, Jensen? No, I would avoid it, sir. It was a civilian, a bellman, He smoked on the roof. I decided to let it go. You let him get back to work? Yes, I ... I was going to shoot, if it makes you feel better. - You compromised our position. - I did not, I protected. Chavez, give us a minute. Now. He served para tu padre in Iraq. I did not know, sir. I did not like very well, I must say. - Is that true, soldier? - So is. I would have given my life for him. And I was close a few times. But in the end, he died for people like me can have a second chance. For the record, I feel what has happened to the Barada unit ... Good... Thank my Lord. Come on, go. You and Chavez are going to get something for dinner. - Obey, now. - Yes sir. ODESSA FOOTBALL TEAM The entire top floor of the hotel, very limited access. This does not end until you see those men in body bags. It is reported injuries among civilians in the place, although military officials still have not confirmed. - No mobile coverage. - Great. Skony, Jensen and Chavez on the way. The clashes erupted overnight between rival Israeli and Syrian along the border factions. Do Gherkins Salazar? - We live for that, sir. - Then everything is fine. Our phone line does not have. I'm going to check. In what appears to be the most brazen attack in Odessa, this year. Lord, look at this. - The bomb killed three and wounded 15. - What's this? Among the dead Larisa Leontyev, the wife of the recently assassinated Chief Bratski criminal Krug, Joseph Salazar. The police call it a change of power in the Circle of Brothers. But one thing is certain, the death toll will continue to rise while the Circle of Brothers try to take control the drug business in Eastern Europe. Investigations into the attack so far ... Shit! Turn off that, now! Forgive me my love. It's my fault, please forgive me. Will the team B, is in the position? Team B is in position. - They're armed. - We are an easy target. Move, move! Come on! I downed two. - You're good? - I'm fine. Review of dead. Anav, ¿cotton? Anav, ¿cotton? We must meet with Skony. Skony, we have discovered! I repeat, they have discovered us! Go up in the elevator! Danger: elevator machine room, only authorized personnel. - Max, what the hell was that? - It was a thunderclap. A thunder? That was a damn bomb! Reactívalo. I do not know how. Stop smoking marijuana while you're working, Emilian. Perhaps this drugged, but I tell you that something bad will happen. Too many motherfuckers going around. I'll call someone before it worsens the situation. You know what I mean? Police? I want to report something suspicious ... Get out of the hotel! - Skony, speaking Jensen, do you copy? - I copy, Jensen. We hostile on both elevators. The I stopped for now, but go way up. Get ready, sir. Copied. How many? Four in the parking lot, one escaped. A second team in the lobby, maybe 20. They seem to have Chavez, sir. - Dead? - Negative. The elevators do not work, Chavez has fallen, Jensen does not know if she's alive or dead. I want you to watch the door. I want to Ramirez and Luca taking their positions on the stairs. Two teams are way up. Go away! It is understood. Do you think that Chavez was deliberately targeted? Everything happened very fast, sir. You know, I have the impression that ... you're kidding me. Yes, you are using some kind of damn Zen riddle or some shit. When you call me, not for a fucking joke. It's not about who stole the boots and cigarettes barracks. When I called ... It is a damn neck. When I called ... it is a matter of life and death. This is the time that is closer to God. And I was not born in a damn truck. And I was not born last night. I was born in a fucking sunny day. I've done this for a long time. Do not think I am new to this, do not think you can fool me. Come straight to the point. What the hell happened? It's okay. Okay, I think that the attack was coordinated. It started when we arrived at the hotel. I'm not talking about thugs with AK. They were people with military training. Three teams, coordinated attack. I've seen it many times. What weapons used? As I said, AK. I also heard some rifles M4, sir. There was a traitor. But I guess you already knew. It seems I'm now getting some clear answers. Maybe we can get to the bottom of this. So Chavez was captured, then, what happened? Jensen. I will go after them. Negative. You must go out and seek reinforcements. We have no communication, there is only one short-range radio. Sorry, sir, Chavez could still be alive. I will not leave her here. Negative. Our mission is top priority. I'm giving you a direct order. He says there was a traitor, and for one reason or another, You disobeyed a direct order. I felt that the operation was compromised, sir. I did not know he could trust. I'm giving you a direct order. Jensen. Jensen... Material things, I can replace ... I would die for my family. We have an unknown number of hostile in the building. The doors are mined. There are hostages and at least three dead, for all we know. What do they want? We are trying to contact them. Ana, where are you? We lost three men. I am a woman hostage. Have I reached the meeting point? No, we'll be there in 10 minutes. Come on! Skony. I can see them coming. ¡Oye! Do you really want to do this? I like, Skony. Is strong. But you have to know one thing ... If you want to survive, you have to let me go. Now. Really? You're not going anywhere. Remember, we have the weapons. Are you sure about that? It was so easy. Skony, I cover your back! ¡Cúbreme! ¡Dentze! ¿Dentze? ¡Dentze! I explain something to you, Mr. Skony. Do you know who owns this hotel know? - Not me. - What? - So is. I built this suite for me. This little friend here ... I've been waiting for long. One day I thought maybe I could live here. A nice dream. I always promised myself I find death, she would not find me. When it comes time to step aside ... I wish it were honorable. To finally make me ... all I have avoided all these years. What thing? Become a husband. Not a gangster. Not someone to be feared. So I decided... it was time. And what happened? They killed me Larisa. They attacked my family. For them... I say only four words. The problems never come alone. Hey, where the hell are you going? I'll save the skin of his Marshal, Mr. Skony. It seems that the decision of Marshal Skony to move the prisoner They triggered a series of unacceptable risks. That's how I see it. Are you okay with that? What could I do? To get to the nearest US base? Come on, sir, I told you, I read the file. Skony not give our operational orders. The you, lord gave. Bring the Marshal. Agent Harrison, I said I should not trust him. Marshal Dentze, I think I know the Marshal Jensen. It's okay... So, here you are with just a scratch. You mean something, soldier? Yes. - Traitor! - You should be dead. You expected, huh? What did you do with Chavez? Enough, soldier. I said, calm down. What happened with Chavez? Piece of shit, traitor! Get him out of here. - Traitor! - Take out the soldier here. I did not know he was alive, you know? - I had to make. - Yes, good idea, sir. Another thing that bothers me. I'm trying to arms parts and I wonder why Salazar fought side Skony and his team. Dentze was there, wounded, but I saw enough to say that Salazar was armed and helped Skony. And this is another detail ... incomprehensible, bizarre ... a combination of shit. Yes, I take time to discover it too, sir. I do not expect to be liked any of you, but I hope you believe me if I say I know how the hell to do to get them out of here. - It's time. - Hear, hear. Listen, I'll make this easy for you. I would exchange all hostages by one man. Mike Darol agent. Does anyone know who is speaking? The DEA agent, Mike Darol. Would you mind calling the Consulate and find out who the hell is this Darol? - Immediately! - I'll spare you the effort. I'm Mike Darol. Thank you, Jesus or God, any of you who now takes care of me. I pray that in this dangerous time you continue killing all those bastards with guns and a beating, if possible. Amen. Do not do it. It is kush, that shit is purple. Yes, I smelled. Good shit. Follow me. By the way, Emilian, you should not pray like that. The Lord has heard my prayers so far. Good point. Have you heard anything about Chavez, a woman Marshal? How could I know? They are Russian and speak Russian. We are in Romania. We speak Romanian. I'm going home. You and I will meet the Marshal. Like in the movies, okay? We'll use this. They're all terribly cranky, here. Maybe I saw a bastard before, when I was fleeing from other bastards firing - And they beat your Marshal. - Show me. Are you sure you want to do this? I have no choice, right? The people there are innocent. I can not let them die for me. It's okay. Listen, this is the plan. Twenty minutes after the release of the last hostage, my computer enter. If you have managed to stay alive, we will remove it. If not... Well, let's make him suffer. I am reassured. Good plan. We will release the hostages in exchange for a DEA agent. Get ready for action. Take them! - Where we go? - On the right! Come on, come on, come on! And what am I supposed to trust you for this? Income ... Something is wrong. The microphone just died. What do you mean with the microphone just died? - Restores the audio, now. - How? Resets the audio, now, I told you! I want a report on the situation. Who the hell are you? I'm the man who should have called when things started to go wrong. I need 2 teams of 6 men immediately. Why the hell did you do that? I asked him killed. Why still alive? I freed myself, I gave you the information and the location of his wife, all good faith, all you had to do was keep her alive until you talk to me. - It was a small accident. - A little accident? You destroyed his house with a bomb! Listen, Harrison already made his deal with Salazar. A new life under the eye of the DEA. All I had to do was give names to change. At the end of the day, Salazar accept the deal. So, for 500 ... for 500 million dollars, I offered him free. No more would the DEA on the back ... Or give names. And like Keyser Soze, simply disappear. His wife... His wife was my advantage! Do you understand? I could not tell you the deal until Harrison make his move because I knew you were going to find a way to screw up and you did it anyway. Good... That's a lot of money. What can I say? Money does not matter to me! I want him dead! Your... You killed your wife. And now we have to kill him. Because he'll kill us. That's what I do not understand. I'm a step ahead in this game. My men are coming home security at this time. He'll be dead soon. Listen out... - I do not need you anymore. - Oh, if you need me ... - No, you no longer need. - I know where you are going Salazar. Salazar know where it goes. There are three tunnels that were created to stabilize the building foundation. One of them is dry and clean and ends at 274 meters past the police line. I think that's where going Salazar. Someone approaches. Keep your head down. - It's still alive. - Thank my Lord. - Are you a religious man, Emilian? - Usually not. But I think he'll listen this time. Agáchate. Ana, are you in position? Yes, we got to the meeting place. What should we do? Oh shit. Go, just go. Drainage tunnels are dry and clean. If they can reach one, They should be able to get out of here and get help. Ramirez sees the tunnel and bring our men here quickly. It is understood. But not so fast. Enjoy the ride. Luca, go first. Skony, three! Cover me! I'll take Luca! Come on, come on, come on! ¡Skony! ¡Jensen! Here! Come on! Hold on, soldier. Luca, stay with me. Come on! Hold. Stay with Salazar. lateral attack. Can do it? Sí. ¡Ve! ¿Income? Take this. We have to go for the girl. And! Stay close. Motherfucker! Move on! Now! Son of a bitch! - I'm tired. - Yes. Listen, the type of the DEA, Darol, was with them, you know why? - Do you know what is it? - Do not. This is ... what is left. I told you to leave 3 million behind. But I did not say drop everything. 500 million. Maybe more. Who knows? - How is Ana? - She's dead. ¡Tómenla! The Darol agent is corrupt. And it's one of the reasons why the Bratski Krug is so strong. That makes sense. Do you know how deep is this? This is the reason for our unscheduled stop here. To come to my hotel. The deal was simple. The key to my freedom. It is not a big price to pay, right? I do not know, it's a lot of money. You know who else is involved with Darol? Now my old friends have become my new enemies. And now my enemies are your enemies too. It looks like it is. But they have my partner. Maybe she's more than your partner, right? May be. May be. My friend, believe me. The price we pay for taking it ... It will be much greater than you can imagine. 500 million dollars, huh? Keep it. We go for it. Sinclaire, once I told you how I escaped the Russian army through Afghanistan in '91, and finished as the father of Larisa hit man in Odessa, many years ago? Only every time we play chess. You also told me that if you leave me all won. But you have not won yet. Yes, but if the game is just Salazar. Within 5 minutes, the SWAT team enter. And I have a feeling that you can have the end of Bin Laden. So you can deal with them, or give me the damn key as we had agreed. Consider it done. You want me to believe that the agent was corrupt Darol? Now we are only two of us in this room, Jensen. Yes sir. Why Salazar said it? I do not know. You know... by half a million dollars, diamonds, gold ... I do not know, I begin to think that maybe the traitor is Amanda Chavez. I do not know if he was a hostage. I think it was a traitor. No, it is not possible. Does he met before being assigned to the unit? God... You knew my father, sir? You know, he told me ... "in such a situation ... I tell the truth, son. " "It may be your only chance to escape." So, I declare once again, sir, Amanda Chavez did not know before this mission. You said he saw the shot, but then he testified that he was not injured during the shooting, so I'm confused. He wore a bulletproof vest. Many of the bullets fired transgress those vests, unless ... Lord, I found the vest with a bullet inside, had no traces of blood. But are you sure she was not the traitor? No. Do you know what happened? God... Well, let the Marshal Jensen there. Go to the service elevator. Press the button and enter the elevator arrives. Low to the basement. Then salts. Chavez enters the Marshal. The elevator doors close. The rest I leave to your imagination. Well, I go first. 4 minutes. Do not worry, it's more than we need, Salazar. What the hell ...? You go for the girl. I take care of Sinclaire. Take this! Come on! You'll join your friend in a body bag. It's okay. Come on. Good trip my friend. - Get me out of here. - I have you. - You're good? - I'm fine. - They hurt you? - I'm not well. - We have to go, okay? - It's okay. Wait... Wait... I'm glad you're well. We have to go, okay? It's okay. I'm not armed. Show me. It's hurt. What happened? He only managed to shoot once. It is not a big thing. You're good? I'm fine. What is the best way to get out of here? This is the fastest way out. Well, what are we waiting for? Come on. You know what? He lost, but not me. I admit, it is not something honorable. I'm sure that will not let you sleep, Salazar. The problem is that there is now a person I care ... and you have an appointment with the Department of Justice. Do you think you trust them? Do not come any closer. Are you planning to kill me? I saved your life there. Do not insult me, Salazar. You needed me. you have not noticed yet. True? Emilian. I'm fine. I'm sorry friend. No wonder who paid my salary. If you had asked, I would have told you. It is Mr. Salazar. The best of the best. I told you... I would give everything for my family. I think you can understand this. If you hurt her ... I will do what must be done to find. Maybe, my friend. May be. Raise your hands! Put your hands up and get on your knees! I'm from the US Marshals. My ID is in my right pocket. I'm from the US Marshals. My ID is in my right pocket! They speak English? I'm from the US Marshals! I Lift him. Give me a reason. Let me ask you once more outside official records. Do you know where Amanda Chavez and Salazar are know? The thing is that I know as much as you, sir. I have no idea where they are. Did you know that the real name is Amanda Chavez Salazar? By their reaction I assume is quite surprised ... Chavez alias Amanda Amanda Salazar, He is the younger sister of Joseph "The Shark" Salazar. The head of the Circle of Brothers, Bratski Krug, in the last 20 years. All are surprised to see me still alive. Especially you, little girl. And the reason why everything went wrong Darol is that Mike was too stupid and greedy to realize that even a violent offender as Salazar still it has moral and ethical. The price we pay for taking it It will be much greater than you can imagine. We have no idea where they are or how we can find them. They have literally disappeared. What are you waiting for, soldier? Come on. The body in the bag is a certain Joseph Salazar. - And Larisa? - It was the price to pay. We all have secrets. I'm fine. So I am pleased that you have told me the truth And I would like to know if you are willing to help. Makes sense. We want to Salazar back and we need to find it. It's okay. You said Joseph Salazar and Chavez Amanda are dead. How did they die? Lord, I saw him die ... The Shark and Chavez died in the crossfire.
