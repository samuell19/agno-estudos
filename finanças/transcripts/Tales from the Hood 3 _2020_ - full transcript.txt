Are we there? Shh. It's gonna be okay, but we got to go. - 'Kay? - Okay. Alright. Come on. - Look! I can see it over there. - Yeah. Do you see the bad things? No. No, I think we can rest here for a minute. What do they look like up close? The bad things? They're just, uh... evil. Shh-shh-shh. Can you tell me a story? No, we have to be real quiet. But when I'm scared, Mommy tells me a story. Well, your mommy knows all the stories. I don't know any good stories. Can I tell you a story? - But I'm scared. I'm really scared. - Okay, okay, okay. But you have to whisper. Okay? - Like this? - Yeah. Just... like... that. Okay. Once upon a time, there was a... What do you want? Look, man, I just need to talk to you, you know, for a second. I already told you, you call my lawyer you got something to say. Just hear me out for a minute, and I'll leave you alone. I promise. Please? You got five minutes. Take a look at this. Why are you showing me this? Be... Well, 'cause this is what you're holding up. A new medical complex that this area desperately needs. Since when do you care about the neighborhood? You know, I heard a rumor that this whole medical building thing is just a hoax to get people to move. That you're really planning on building more condos with much higher rent. Everybody else took my generous offer and... and moved. Your family's the last ones here. Okay, I shouldn't do this, but, um... I'll up it ten grand if you get out by the end of the week. I can't do that. My son is halfway through chemotherapy, and the doctor says it's important that he has no extra stress. Moving is stressful. I'm not gonna risk my son's health for anything or anybody. So, you keep your money. - We will leave when Ethan is well... - Stop bouncing that damn ball! Ethan, you keep bouncing that ball, son. You get the fuck outta my place now. It's not your place. It is right now. So, get out! I am not gonna tell you again. Hey. That's my boy. That's my boy. Hey, Joe. Uh, what's up? I'll tell you what's up. I need to clear escrow on this damn building in two weeks or my financing falls through. You told me there'd be no problems, and now I hear there's a family that you haven't been able to evict. Uh, just a, you know, tiny snag. You know, some, uh, some judge's mom was, you know, probably frightened by... by a landlord. Oh. Um... listen, man, they got a sick kid. Okay? They claim they can't move until their little brat finishes chemotherapy. When you sold me this building, you said it was all free and clear. If you screw me up... ...I'll have my lawyer sue you for fraud and send you to the fucking poorhouse. Yeah. Uh, yeah, man. I... I got it. No... no... no biggie. Hey! Jesus, Mickey. Got you that time, huh? Come on inside, man. Come on. Haven't seen you in a while, man. You need another job? - Have you been taking your medication? - Which one? That stuff fucks with my head, dude. I like to be clear. Anyway, um, I need to ask your advice. Fire away. I got some people I need to get out of one of my buildings. I mean, like, yesterday. Hey, David. How the Bears been doin'? Hey, man! Stop trippin' out and concentrate on what I'm saying! How do you start a fire that, you know, that won't kill anybody or... or anything, - but do enough damage to make 'em go? - I can do that if you want! Like that building I torched on Eighty-third so you could collect the insurance. Yeah, that... that went smoothly. Maybe we can work something out. Which building and which apartment? Ruby Gates. Third floor, east corner, apartment 313. That dump? That's easy. That place is already a fire trap. All you gotta do is start a big grease fire in the kitchen. When they hear the fire alarm, they got lots of time to get out the rear exit before the fire can even get close to 'em. Hey, man, how you, um, how you know all that stuff? You weren't thinking about torching one of my buildings? I think about a lot of things. Same price as the Eighty-third Street job? Double. I didn't have to sneak past anybody on that one. Okay. I'll show up with the money after I hear the job is done. Okay. LeBron dribbles across the key, he cuts between defenders, goes to the hole... - Slam dunk! - And the crowd goes wild! - Whoo! Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! Time to hit the hay, Mr. MVP. You need your rest. Joey told me that people with tumors die. Will I die? Of course not. We have the best doctors around. We're gonna cure you. You are gonna live to be an old man just like your daddy. That's pretty old. Tell me about it. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who the fuck is this? Um... s... sorry, detective. Um... Is... is something wrong? Ma'am, could you please stay right behind that line? - Hey, um, officer... - Sorry, no. It's restricted. I'm David Burr. I'm the owner of the building. You got it. Go in. Mr. Burr. Detective Powers. Um, what happened? Fire up in apartment 313. - Was anybody hurt? - No! No! My husband and my son! Where are they? No, no! Paul! Ethan! No! No, no, no! Oh, God! Please, no, no! Um... h... how'd this happen? Looks like a grease fire. We're not sure how it started. Why didn't they try to, you know, to take the fire exit? Looks like they tried. As far as we can tell, smoke alarm failed. By the time they realized the place was on fire, smoke was probably overwhelming. And then when they tried to break the window, sudden rush of oxygen created a fireball. Um, well, the mother's still alive. They think she's gonna make it? Don't know. She burnt real bad. Excuse me. Yes? You've reached the Bradford residence. We're not available right now because you burned us alive. David. Didn't expect you till later. Come on. Figured you... you'd want your money. Oh, no rush. I trust ya. Hey, let's celebrate, man. That family's out of Ruby Gates, right? They sure are. I got a malt liquor in here with your name on it. You don't watch the news, do you? Hell, no. Don't you know? When you watch people on TV, they watch you back. It's creepy. Why? People are dead, Mickey. Now, I'm an accomplice to a murder. If the cops haul you in, what you gonna say? Nothing, man. I wouldn't tell 'em nothing. - Bullshit. - Ah! Hello? You and me have gotta be the two luckiest men alive today. Escrow on the Ruby Gates building just closed, and we made a big-ass ton of cash. That's, uh... Tha... that's great. Yeah. I'm going on this, uh, cruise, on this boat out of Thailand they call "The Love Boat." International waters. You can come with me, if you like. Uh, that sounds... that sounds fun, but, um... I got some, um, some paperwork I... I... I gotta do around here. Suit yourself. Don't spend it all in one place. This is ICU. Um, hey, um, is there a... a patient there by the name of, uh, Staci Bradford? Are you a relative? Yeah. Um, I'm... I'm her cousin. I just wanted to see, uh, how she was... how she was doin'. I'm sorry, Mrs. Bradford passed away about 20 minutes ago. Her brother is here. Do you want to speak with him? Hello? Who is this? Who the fuck is this? Okay. You wanna play, huh? Let's play, then. Alright, I'm here. All right. It's Staci Bradford's brother, isn't it? Hey, listen, man, why don't you stop playing fucking games, right? Come on out here and face me like a man. Stop being a little bitch. Okay. Okay. Alright. How about we have a civilized conversation, you know, and come to some sort of agreement, man? Fuck this. Oh, shit. Mom! Dad! Oh, shit. Pick me up, pick me up, pick me up. Pick me up, pick me up, pick me up. Pick me up, pick me up, pick me up. Whoo! Alright. I see I got tricked. Gonna take more than that, you maladjusted motherfuckers. Oh, shit. Alright, I see there's more of you clowns up in this bitch. No problem. I got bullets for all y'all. More of y'all to shoot. Oh, shit! Oh! You need to stop messing with me before you get hurt! Go open up a... a haunted attraction or something! Fuck. Fuck. Shit. No. Your momma told you that? No, we saw it on the news. Aw, you shouldn't be watching the news. Mommy lets me. Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to talk to her about that. Okay? Because... Yeah. Because... you're too young. Are we gonna be okay? - Are the bad things still here? - I don't think so. Look! Is that them? Are they the bad things? No, I can't see them. You know, the bad things, they... they know how to hide. They know how to make themselves look normal. Evil has a way of looking really nice and shiny on the outside, on the surface, when it has to. That's why we're gonna go that way. Okay? I'll tell you what. You can tell a story, but you gotta whisper, okay? You gotta use your quiet voice. Okay? Okay, this one's different. Good. So, once upon a time... What you looking at? You think I won't? I will! I most pertinently will! Greetings, patriots, this is Denton Wilbury reporting from bunker 5-Alpha-8. I am still here and still engaged. For those who have managed to sneak me in food and other pro-ventions, I am truly grateful. The fact that you've been able to get them to me on the regular is just proof as to the utter un-competency of those in charge and running this damn country. Given time, I know there'll be enough of us to unite and reclaim our greatness once and for all. It is never too late to return to what we once were, a country of values, based on a con-stu-pation as told by a white god to white men, where Second Amendment con-spit-a-rors, black monkey hoodlums, illegal beaners, ragheads, and L-G-B-Q-T-U-R-X-W-Y-Z, weirdos and sinners were rightfully unwelcome in the land of the free and the home of the brave. For 30 long years, they've been trying to move me off my land. "Ignorant Domain", my ass. Hell, this land is my land. Only thing ignorant on this land is me and my guns. So, I shall continue to resist the notion of surrendering this post, friends. I will not give in to a government that wants to take my guns or take a white man's rights and give them to a bunch of murderous infidels. Aw, they had badges and bullhorns, troopers and sharpshooters, Commies and coons. Oh, they came for me, they did. They even built some wall around me. Believe that? They couldn't build the wall we needed. The one in-vasioned by this country's last truly great leader. When he was elected to power, he had more people at his incarceration than any president ever. If you don't believe me, you can read about it in the mystery books. Educate yourself on the mystery of white America. So, you can see what is real, and avoid all fake Jews. Yet, they had the gumption to build one around me, as if I'm the problem. As if I'm the threat. Don't matter none, I'm dug in, and I will remain dug in, protecting this bunker until my final breath, if that is what it takes to reignite the evolution! Oh, shit. They're at it. Please, don't... Please, refrain from any antagonizing behavior. That's right. That's right. Refried! Refried! I see you. Trying to wear me down with precursor grenades, make me go crazy from the sound. How many years wasting your time? Wasting tax payer dollars! I'm too mentally challenged for you to break me. I said stop. We are not here to antagonize the man. Yeah, I don't need to be aggrandized. You don't wanna aggrandize me. You damn Commie fools. I can see gorillas at the gates. Damn. Traitor. I know of you, missy. I been a victim of your lack of ethnic whore-ality. Your debate-ment of your in-herni-ent superiority. I could give you a taste of this. That'd get you back on track. It's not a bad idea. Mm-mm. Brothers, is it a lonely mission? At times. At times I want companionship. Company of a good white woman who knows what and who she is, one that doesn't sleep or parade about with monkeys like one traitorous whore I know. So, fuck that bitch I once loved, Patricia and her monkey-loving madness. In fact, she's not a bitch, she's a witch. That's a white bitch. I took out the "B" and added a "W", come up with "witch". Clever, I know, but I'm not talking about her. I need me a white woman that is true blue. Yes, I do yearn for female companionship. Thirty years is a long time to be alone, even if I do have a queer-em of inferior harlots to attend my... kernel desires. In fact, there's only one thing a female of any race other than white are good for. That's to get down on her haunches, hindquarters raised, to be of proper service for my Uncle Sam when he's standing at ascension. Yeah. Come here, baby. Yeah. You like that, huh? You like that? You know you're here to serve this white master? - Hm? Yeah. - That's enough. - That's enough. - Oh, enough for who? Not enough for me, Takwandaneesha Washington! You feel that white power between your legs, huh? To any y'all listening in, that's the sound of monkey poon! Monkey poon! ♪ Monkey poon, monkey poon ♪ ♪ Coming soon in monkey poon ♪ Go ahead, fire away! I'm firing in here on all syllables! Time to pick fruit, you border-crossing ho! Have some ass taco! Yeah. Yeah. Now, don't worry, I'll save some white seed for y'all. Chinky-Lou, I'm gonna let you chop this stick. And Ass-ama, I'm gonna run a Jihad on that janky ass. And for you, Jesus-killer, gonna break that hymen, Hymie. But right now, I'm the mayonnaise on a... in a Black and beaner sammich. Ow! You nappy-haired harlot! Oh, you think it's funny making me slam my Uncle Sam into concrete wall, huh? Oh, for Christ's sakes. I'm sorry. Will you forgive me? I'm sorry I laid down alongside those inhuman harlots... in front of you. But it was only to show them their place. Not to de-fiend you, my queen. You are my godless. My pure, white, delicious... godless. Oh, ah, yes. Oh. Oh, Jesus. Sugar dumpling, I done hurt you. I... I can fix it. I'll make it all better. Promise. Promise. Just wait. Ah! Okay, it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better. To any of my supporters out there that sometimes sneak me food, I'd really appreciate, well... ...a nice, new poster of a fine white woman. Uh, given my druthers, one that's draped in red, white, and blue, and parched up on a big, monkey-maiming, spic-smooshing, camel jockey jacking, Jew-killing, white missile. Also, if possible, a... couple of new dolls for my queer-em. A black one and a brown one. Seems I've about given the ones here all their subhuman asses can handle, so if you could arrange that, then you will have my humble thanks and gravi-tide. Well, time's late. Gonna go out, fill the canteen, take one last look at the dirty diaper-spora of ethnic scum they got keeping an internal watch on your humble servant, then come back in and lock down for the night. 'Til tomorrow, this is Denton Wilbury, constipation-loving, ain't taking my guns, second amended-ment supporting, illegal alias hating, L-G-B-Q-R-S and the rest of them goddamn letters despise-ering, God-fearing, true American signing off. Goddamn it! Alrighty, then. Bang, bang, bang! Bang, bang, bang! Bang, bang, bang! Come on, buddy, let's go, let's go. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! That was it! The final straw. You can call that the straw that broke the mammal's back! So, what? Y'all want a piece of me? Come get some. I'll shoot your black asses. I sure as hell will! You wanna try me, any of ya? Bring it on, infant-tells! Bring it the fuck on! I thought we got all those real bullets out of there. - Ugh, I'm gonna hear about this. - Is he dead? Yeah, is he dead? Don't. Don't bang on the force field. Yeah, Jimmy. It disturbs the animals. You think they're all extinct? No, I think the Mississippi Zoo might still have one. Hey, do we have time to go see the misogynist exhibit? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, well, the zoo doesn't close for another 20 minutes. So, if we hurry, okay? Let's go. I can't wait! I hope it's as cool as the last one. So, where did that tall tale come from? What's a tall tale? It's a story that isn't real. It happened. Mom told me. But will she be okay? Yeah. Yeah, she's gonna be fine. Because you never come to pick me up. It's always Mom. Yeah, well, this time she called me, and she asked me to come get you. All those monsters and stuff. But she's gonna be okay. And look here, we're gonna be fine too. We just got to get to our spot, and she's gonna meet us there. Those demons, they're scary. Demons? You said that's what's chasing us. No, I said "monsters". Mom takes me to church. They talk about demons. You don't come to church. That's why you can't see them. You never go to church. Mommy goes every Sunday. Yeah, well, your mother is a saint. I'm more of a, uh... work in progress. - Alright, we gotta rendezvous. - What's "rendezvous"? Rendezvous, that's where we're gonna meet your mother. Carry me again? On your back this time. Come on, but you're heavy for your size. On the way, can I tell another story? Well, since you're right by my ear, I guess I don't have any choice.

Shit. What the hell?! Okay, put me down! - I can walk! - Supposed to be singing backup! Back the fuck up! Thank you. - Hey, hold on. - What? You wanna yell at me too? Nah, I don't work for E-Lips. I was just sitting in on the session. Then why don't you go back in there? Because I'm interested in finding talent. And you have more in your little finger than E-Lips has in her whole damn body. Thank you. But that is what just got me fired, so... Just... Will you come talk to me for a second? God, why did I do that? I always self-destruct, and I needed that job, too. No, you don't. Backup singing is just dimming your light. She fired you because she knows her voice can't compete with yours. True. But tell that to my landlord 'cause he don't give a fuck. What you need is to be seen by the right people. You need a manager. And are you a manager? Aspiring. Look, give me a few months. And if I can't make it happen, then dump me. - What you got to lose? - A roof over my head. A way to pay my bills. You want me to go on? What's your name? Chela Simpson. Chela Simpson, my name is Park. You say you need a job? I think I can get you one. I run errands for this rich, old lady who lives in this sweet-ass mansion. She's looking to find a paid companion. So, what do you think? Damn. Nice place. I told you she has major bank. She was so beautiful. Let's go meet her. She's right in here. Is that her? Miss Benoit, this is my friend, Chela. It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Benoit. Of course it is. Please, have a seat. Aren't you a pretty thing? And as you can see, I love being surrounded by pretty things, including Park. Back in my prime, I would have seduced you both. Probably at the same time. You're flushing, my dear. Well, you'll have to get used to my frankness. Why have filters at my age? Yes, ma'am. Of course. Mmm. Park, will you go pick up my blood? No problem, Miss Benoit. I'll be right back. Um... did you just tell him to pick up blood? The indignities of old age. Yes, I... I'm anemic, and I need transfusions, and I hate hospitals, so I have them here. Oh. Right. But don't wait too long to lay with him. I can smell the chemistry between the both of you. So, how you getting along with Miss Benoit? Oh, my God. I'm about to lose my fucking mind. - That's what. - How come? Because all we do all day, every day, is watch this old-ass video of her doing Carmen. She never gets tired of it. And it's like torture because I fucking hate opera. Especially, when I have to watch the same one over and over and over and over again. Are you bored? No. No, ma'am. Of course not. I mean... you had such a beautiful voice. I was just wondering if you maybe had, uh, any other tapes? You don't understand. This was my one and only public performance. What? In 1958, it was unheard of for a colored girl to star in an opera. But I was allowed to be hired as the third understudy. The two girls ahead of me came down with a flu. They were sick as dogs. It was Saturday night, and they were desperate. So, I went on. And I had this man... Uh, well, I can't remember his name. Anyway, he was in love with me, and he had a motion camera. I got him to film it. And as you can see... - Uh... - Oh... I was... spectacular. Miss Benoit, you... Oh, dear. Oh, you thought I couldn't walk. Oh, no, it's just that my knees hurt me so much, so much of the time, that I have... I ju... Ooh. I just don't even bother. I was so good that the theater owner wanted to make me his star. And then came the damn uproar. Folks enraged because they let that nigger play Carmen. Demanded their ticket money back. Cretins. That's really messed up. I even got fired as an understudy, and I never had another opportunity after that. Time just passed me by. Oh, people despise old almost as much as they do black. I know what it's like not to be able to do what you love. I, um, I never told you this, but I'm a singer, too. Oh! You are? Opera? No, ma'am. Just pop, R&B. I write my own stuff, too. Well, please. Let me hear you, dear. Please. Yes, yes, yes! Okay. Okay, okay, okay. - Stand up. Yes. - Okay. ♪ 'Cause I'm up now ♪ ♪ And you need the constant control ♪ ♪ But I feel down ♪ ♪ And you need the constant control ♪ You have a serviceable instrument. And with proper training, you might develop into a real singer. You fucking bitch! Ahh! Fuck you! I am a real singer. Oh. Oh, my dear. I have hurt your feelings, haven't I? Oh, I... That was not my intention. Listen, I want you to go into my bedroom upstairs. On the corner table, you'll see a jewelry box. Please go, bring it to me. Go. I'm so sorry, dear. Oh, my God. All right. Now, this was given to me long ago by an admirer. It's from Austria. And I want you to have it. Thank you, Miss Benoit. It really is beautiful. Oh, you're welcome, dear. Oh. Are you okay? I'm feeling a little exhausted. I need a transfusion. Please go to the refrigerator and get me a bag of blood. Don't you need, like, a nurse - to come in and do all of that? - Oh, no, no, no, no. Look. I have a permanent catheter, and it's... it's very easy. I'll show you. Gross. chela: And then, she had me hang the bag up and attach the tube to her arm. Look, what's wrong, baby? You can't be that frosted over the transfusion? I sang for her today. And then she told me that I wasn't a real singer. Oh, she's a crazy old lady, Chela. You can't let her get to you. When she said that thing about me not being a real singer, I saw red. I want to kill that bitch. Do you want to? Do I want to what? Do you want to kill her? Because that's a way to make a lot of money. Alright, Miss Benoit's got a ton of cash... ...jewels, and other valuable shit up in the house. She doesn't like banks. She's got no family. We could clean the place out and nobody would be the wiser. You can't be serious. With that kind of cash, we could buy a studio. Pay big producers, take you right up to the top. Chela, are you ready to record now? Mm-hm. What's wrong? You'll never be a singer, girl. Never! Never! - Oh, shit. - Baby, what's wrong? Oh, my God, that was awful. Holy fuck, that was terrible. It's okay. It's okay, you just had a nightmare. No. Do you really think we could do it? Get away with killing her? Yeah, I d... I do. Then let's do it. Let's kill her. Okay, so explain this to me again. How is this supposed to kill her? Okay, I'm a universal donor, which means I can give blood to anyone. But you're type B. Miss Benoit's type O. If we put type B in her, then her antibodies will attack her own blood. She'll get sick and die. It's like poisoning her. Everybody'll think she died of anemia. You dig? The next time I pick up the blood for Miss Benoit, I'll mix some of your blood into it. Spread it out over a week, so it builds up slowly. Yeah, is that... is that enough? I'm starting to get woozy. Yeah. Yeah, that... that's plenty. Okay, Chela, I'm doing this tomorrow. If you wanna change your mind... now's the time. No. I'm good. Let's take the old bag out. Are you okay, Miss Benoit? Well, I've been feeling... badly on and off for the past few days. It must be the flu. Oh, no. You know what? I'm gonna go get you a glass of water. - Chela? - Yes, ma'am? Come. What? Come. I want to thank you. You are a gift. Come on, Miss Benoit, you're freaking me out. Don't talk like that. You're gonna be just fine. Mmm. I am sure that you are right. You know what? You're really not looking good. I'm gonna go call Park. Oh, my God! The crazy ass old bitch is D-E-A-D. Dead! - And we are rich... - Bitch! [MUSIC BOX PLAYS Park? No! Ah, ah, ah! Miss Benoit? What's happening? Can you hear me? Park? Park! Park! Park! What? Park! What? Park! What? Park! What? Wait! What? No! No! Park! Park! Park! Park! Miss Benoit's room? How did I get here? Park? Park? Where is he? Oh, God, I feel like everything hurts. What is happening? What is happening? What is happening? What is happening? Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. Park! Park! Come and help me! E... everything hurts! Chela? Is that you? - What is wrong with me? What happened to me? - Calm down, Chela. - Oh, my God, you don't know. You gotta help me. - Calm down, Chela. Calm down, okay? Please help me. Help me. - Please. - I'll help you. We've been lovers for many decades, Marie and I. Who do you think it was that shot that film of her? I was the first to steal a body, but Marie, she was very patient. She waited until I could find her the... perfect instrument. Goodbye, Chela. Yes, thanks for coming. Alright, next. Chee-la Simpson? Go ahead. Are we almost there? Well, we can certainly get there a lot faster if we were to take this. I don't like it. You do wanna go and see your mommy, don't you? Then we get on. Here we go. Beautiful. - Once upon a time... - No! The stories you tell don't need no "once upon a time". Okay, how about "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"? Where did you learn that? Mommy reads to me. "It was the age of wisdom and the age of foolishness, the epoch of belief and incredulity. The season of light and the season of darkness. We were all going direct to heaven, or maybe we were all going direct the other way..." Ooh! Give me that. Sadly, there's been another attack by the "punch and run bandit" that has left an 80-year-old grandmother in a coma. Today's brutal incident was once again caught on surveillance cameras. The woman is walking from a nearby pharmacy when a man in a black hoodie comes up from behind her and delivers a devastating sucker punch. The assailant then repeatedly kicks the woman until she flips over. 'Cause that inconsiderate bitch was lyin' on top her damn purse, and then had the nerve to have nothing but 15 bucks and a dumb-ass granny phone. This follows a series of other attacks recently caught on camera. A 15-year-old girl, sucker punched on her way home from school. The father of a newborn child on his way home from work. The most recent victim's daughter had this to say. I don't know if the police will catch whoever did this to my grandmother, but mark my words, karma will! Whoever you are, you will feel the pain of the people you hurt, and their loved ones. You will walk a mile in your victim's shoes. Trust. Trust my ass, bitch. He appears to be African-American, six feet tall, and always has his hood up, the color always black. No, this is definitely not a booty call. 'Cause, legally it's only a booty call when there's an exchange of booty. So, in the eyes of the law, this is just an "Are you still up" call. Yeah. No, my mama said I should've been a lawyer, too. Okay, okay. Keep your panties on. You know I like to work for it a little. Okay, yeah, I'll see you in 20. Broke-ass motherfucker. You don't deserve no ass. Goddamn. These some fly-ass kicks. Demon Kix, huh? No wonder your ass broke. Some fool gonna pay good ends for these. Man, hell no, I ain't keepin' 'em, brother. No, these were some limited editions. I can get paid for these joints. They do fit a playa hella nice though. What's that? Oh, yeah, man, come on through. Nah, I'll go downstairs, get us a quick six pack and some chicken. Yeah. Yeah, a'ight. Later. Shit. Wouldn't mind walking a mile in these joints. Won't hurt to wear them for a little bit. Shit's like walking in a goddamn Lamborghini. Shit, what's up, baby girl? Oh, you like these kicks, huh? You ain't gonna find anything like this anywhere else in the city, baby girl. Catch my flow? No. But I can see it. What the fuck? Hope they're waterproof. What the hell? The fuck? Oh, shit! Fuck! Shit. Goddamn it. Dude, what's wrong with you? I shit my fucking pants. Ugh, so I smell! God! Bro, what came up inside your body, laid eggs and died so you smell like this? Yo, Big Mike, man, just shut the fuck up, man. Pretty sure I'm about to call you Big Stinky right now, man. Get in the place, man, let's go. Dude, what got you sick? You think it was the chicken? No, man, I never touched that shit. Thank God. Man, you gotta be fucking kidding me, bro! I don't know the last time I seen a grown man shit his pants. What the... - What the fuck, man? Come on! - What's up? I can't take these goddamn shoes off. Man, you probably too weak from the food poisoning or whatever. That shit will take a nigger out. How the fuck I'm supposed to take my pants off if I can't take off these damn shoes? You gotta help me pull these off, man. My black ass ain't going nowhere near your sick ass. I'm sorry, but I ain't trying to smell your shit while I'm trying to eat. Go on. Close the door. You ain't no kind of friend, nigga. No, I'm the type of friend that don't get involved in another man's shit. Shit. Shit! Ugh. You took a shower in your pants? Man, I couldn't pull these damn shoes off, so I pulled 'em down. It's lucky I jacked that beautician bitch last week and got this. Man, I got to say, despite your stupid shit, pun most definitely intended, those kicks look good as new. Yeah, nigger. Still worth a fortune. If you ever get them bad boys off. I'm-a get these bad boys off, nigger. Even if I... Oh, shit. You feel that? It's cold in here. Cold? It... it's, like, 90 degrees. Man, I'm freezing. Look, dude, ain't no telling what you might have. Now, what you need to do is get your black ass to a clinic or a hospital. Basically, anywhere a thousand miles away from me. Alright, well, at least give me a ride. My car been broke for, like, a week. I'm serious! And, look, I would call 911, but the cops come in here and see all this stolen shit... and your ass going straight to lockup. Oh, man, got to get my ass to a fucking ER. Shit got me hallucinating. What the fu...? Ooh, a statue. Boo! - Hey, he's pretty good. - Tip him and let's go. - Oh, his breath stinks! - Yeah. Nice kicks, but paying for expensive shoes can be murder. Hey, buddy? This is Officer Danski. I've got a man down in the concourse. You will walk a mile in your victim's shoes. Trust. Trust. Trust. Victim's shoes. You will feel the pain of the people you hurt. You will walk a mile in your victim's shoes. Trust. Hey. Hey, doc. Percy Woodhouse. We've been waiting. And waiting and waiting. What? Who the hell is that? Jesus. You're that crazy bitch from the TV. You expect me to believe that voodoo shit is real? You're running from something, so you tell me how real it is. When I invoked a curse for you to walk a mile in your victim's shoes, I had no idea you would make it, oh, so literal. You did what? A proper curse will never give pain to the conjurer. You look confused. Let me explain. Your last victim. Not only did you knock him out, you killed him. - And so now, you get to live his death. - I what? You are experiencing all the physical ailments of the man you killed. - Bullshit! - Really? Let's go over the facts. After you put on the shoes, did you feel... ...a chill? That's the specter of death. You probably pissed and shit yourself. That's what dead bodies tend to do after death, once the muscles relax. The stiffness you felt, temporary rigor mortis. The pain in your stomach... ...and that disgusting smell surrounding you is from bacteria and gas in your gut as it liquifies. As bad as all that sounds, here's your real problem. You now have all the symptoms of death, except you are not dead. What the hell do you mean? What's all this crazy shit I'm seeing? You're seeing chaperones. Angels and demons shuttling deceased souls to heaven, hell, their final destination. Your demons are trying to drag you into hell, but they can't... ...because you are both living and dead. Trapped between life and afterlife. What? Are you trying to say this crazy shit... This... this "me walking around like a corpse" - can happen for the rest of my life? - Your life is over! This is your eternity. You trying to tell me I'm dead? Like, dead-dead? Son. Sadly, you must either finish your death and go to hell, or continue being attacked by demons forever and beyond. Of the two, hell is the better option. But you've got to break the curse. Give this poor fool the rune! Find the body of the man you killed. Next to it, beg for forgiveness. That is your rune. And that is your only hope. You may want to try the morgue. What does this guy want? Just give me a minute. Phil? My anniversary? Tonight. - What're you doing? I'm trying... - I gotta go talk to that dead body, man. I'm trying to die and go to hell before I... I decompose to the point where I can't. This shit ain't medical man! It's spiritual! I gotta go talk to him! I gotta... No! Stop! Stop it! Don't! Stop! Don't! That's one of my favorites. Whatever. We meet Mommy here? Yeah. We meet Mommy here. This place smells dead. Where is she? She'll be here. What's that? It's a camera. I want you to stay... stay right there. This is weird. We gotta use this to make it super safe. Here you go. There it is. Nice. Okay? Hmm. I don't think you really know my mom. What're you talking about? She called me and told me to pick you up at school, that I had to protect you from the bad things. The bad things are already here. - Real close. - Uh-huh. Do you know why I'm so heavy for my size? I think it's because I'm not human. I think it's because I'm something else. - What? Your crazy mama tell you that? - No. I've always known that. The bad things are coming. Yes. Yes. That's why... I want you to... bend down and stay low. Yes. Like hide and seek? Yeah. Just like a game. We're going to have fun? Fun? We're gonna have so much fun. You can only kill them once. Do you recognize them? They remember you. They've been right here where you buried them, waiting for all the fun you promised them. Please! Stop! No. Don't you enjoy hearing their pain? The screams they didn't get to make when they discovered who the real monster was? Oh. I'm sorry. Forgive me. Listen. Please. I can take you to your mommy. You don't know my mommy. But you will know me. William, thief of innocence, murderer of dreams, administrator of nightmares. Welcome to hell, motherfucker. He always gets the good ones. But I... I get you. It hurts. Can I tell you a story?
