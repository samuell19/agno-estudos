This is the Hollow. Our summer house. We built it ourselves. Six or seven years ago. My peers who don’t exercise look like old bats. Before the bridge was built, I used the alder to cross. Spring spate washed the tree roots. The tree fell at night. Our nettles. Nettles are very healthy. Full of mineral salts and vitamins. Young nettles make great juice. Rain. I like rain. This is my husband. That’s Aza. The neighbours’ dog. She spends her life on a chain. There is only one problem. When she’s in heat, Kuba goes crazy. Kuba is our dog. We found him in a ditch by the road. He was lying there, his front paws shattered. He was hit by a car. He spent two months in a cast. I can’t allow new dogs to be born into this world, just to be drowned or abandoned to starve. I can’t take care of all the stray dogs, even though I’d love to. The cat is from the kids who weren’t allowed to keep it. Pikutek, the magpie, is from our neighbour. Poor thing fell out of the nest. It can’t fly yet. And another… Another poor puppy. Kuba became a father again. It was just summer. Why are the trees so beautiful in the fall? Marynia… So colorful before falling asleep. There are no colors, for there is no colorful electromagnetic wave. There are only different vibration frequencies. It’s your brain that produces colors. Sound… There is no sound either. There’s only an acoustic vibrating wave with a frequency ranging from 16 to 20 000 Hz. Is this also a wave? Maybe I’m a wave to you too? Why is the light on? Because I keep thinking, that they’re still there. Andrzej Kondratiuk presents FOUR SEASONS Come down to earth. Give me your hand. - How are you feeling? - Great. - Your head isn’t spinning? - No. Hell’s bells, you have more grey hair. - Where? - In your beard. Time to come up with some stronger herbs. I’ll have a look in my herbarium. Marynia, light it, put the flame to the rose. - Never. - Just pretend you want to burn it. Oh, dear. Is she afraid? Are you scared? No, because you’re with me. You’re definitely scared. No, Kuba. Get away! Leave her alone. Get away from Aza! Kuba! Go home, Kuba! Go on! Go home! My darling doggie, what have you done? Poor Aza will have puppies again. You know that I love you and I can’t stay mad at you but you did a bad thing. A very bad thing. Beautiful little puppies will be born, and Ms Julia will drown them in the stream. Or she’ll give them to her neighbours and they’ll spend their lives on chains. Or it can also be, that she’ll keep the prettiest one and give poor old Aza to a dogcatcher. And Aza will be no more. Aza will die. Because of our Kuba. See what you’ve done, Kuba? Marynia! Marynia, come see. I love you, I love you. I only want you. Tell me, tell me… how many frogs have you had before me? You’re awful. Life… Life. Don't blame Kuba. Blame nature or the Creator, if a creator of worlds truly exists. What comes to be under laws of nature, must come to be. Biorobot Aza generates a signal called “in heat”, biorobot Kuba receives it and due to subtle biochemical and bioelectronic processes he gives in to an urge which he fucking has to give in to. And he does! Because he’s controlled! So the creator has no mercy for a poor bitch kept on a chain birthing puppies which will also spend their lives on chains? No, no. Nature knows no mercy. If nature knew what it meant, evolution would have ended at the stage of protozoa. Why? Only they are immortal, because they reproduce through division. They divide, and divide and divide and no one dies. And you miserable, drunk man would like to live forever? No, but I’d like to live long enough to understand all the things I can’t understand if my life is short. Pour more water. That’s your swing? That’s my cradle. Complete isolation. You see nothing, hear nothing. Once in motion, you lose your benchmark. Cut off from stimuli, brain activates itself by creating its own signal. You want to activate your brain? Is this spinning long? Only two years. - It’ll make electricity? - It will. Power grid is not enough? It’s alternating current, I need direct. I like it the way it is. Spinning selflessly. Mother is very tired with father. What? Mother is very tired with father! When were you to see them? A week ago. Mommy sends her love. One more fell off the cart. Deft pass to the right defender. Pawlak keeps to the right, leaves the ball to Matysik. The Belgians have the ball. We don’t see much from our vantage point, we’re far from the foul line, almost behind the track, here on the stadium. Pawlak was fouled. He’s getting ready for the free kick. Spot kick. Where are our players? Adamiec is there, with one of the defenders. You know, we’ll have to build… …a bridge and a comfy shitter. You know what I’m most afraid of? What are you most afraid of? That it all might be too late. Too late. You’re thinking about dad. I too am afraid of the telegram. Well, I think father will be pleased. And mommy? Mommy… …should be happy that she’ll be with her sons. Sons. A bull inseminated a cow, the cow went into painful labor and a beautiful calf saw the world. Stop or I’ll cry. We’ll cure and smoke it. It’ll be enough meat for the entire stay. The work of nature is infinitely wise. What idea is that for one to eat the other? You can live on beans and lettuce. I’d rather live on the sun and photons. In the end it’s all about… It’s about energy. Do something with those beans, they have overgrown my cables. There can be a short circuit if I start the generator. - Can’t you wait? - I really can’t. Beans are bothering him. Do you know that in the Balkans people who eat beans with oil regularly make love to their wives when they’re a 100 years old. And when they’re a 140, they climb high mountains. They eat nothing but beans with oil? They also eat dark bread, crab apples and drink milk straight from their sheep. We have to buy some sheep. Janusz, you want to see something? - What? - Come, come. Hot diggity! Don’t lean out. - Hide. - Quiet! See? No, a branch is blocking my view. Wait. Pikutek, my darling! You’re all grown up. You’re of age. You have pretty feathers. A great world awaits you. Why don’t you come back to us for a while? Remember, Pikutek, that no one there likes you now. Everyone wants to eat you. A fox, an owl, crows. Don’t trust people either. You’re free. You’re a free magpie. A thieving magpie. Fly, little magpie, fly. Be happy. Fly, Pikutek, fly. - What’s this? - A litter for your father. - This? - We have to carry him. Well, that’s great. Is it comfy? Show me. Go ahead, sit. Oh, I think it’s hard. It might not be hard for him. And a crossbar for his feet so he can keep them up. Well, you built it beautifully. Hey, what, what? Eeny, meeny, miny, moe catch a tiger by the toe. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe! Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, if he hollers let him go. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch a mouse by the toe. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, if he squeals let him go. Bravo, bravo! Thank you, king, thank you. - With a feather or without? - With a feather. What’s up, Kuba? Give him some more feathers. - Two more. - Yes, two more feathers. Kuba. Good boy. - Oh, he built a bridge. - He worked all night. This is a bridge, the bridge, this is our bridge. May this construction serve us and our descendants and the descendants of our descendants! Our hearts are filled with joy. I consider the bridge opened. This is the bridge. This is the bridge! This is the bridge, whose strong arms hold together two banks of a deep river. And this river falls into the sea. There are seas and oceans in the world! That’s an undeniable fact. Just like an undeniable fact is, that on one side of the deep river lives one brother, and the other brother lives on the other side. And now these two brothers can meet in the middle of this river on this very bridge and exchange… …let me say, bam, bam, bam... I will say it, won’t I? A handshake. - Family! Family! - My turn. Artistic part. - How many kilometers is it? - Why? We might run out of gas. - 30 plus 150 times 2. - 360. We have enough. And if the journey is too tiring for them, you’ll spend the night in Warsaw. Yes, yes. We’ll spend the night at our place. I have a favour to ask. Buy me coffee and some good cigarettes. - We will. - Consider it done. Dad, how do you feel in the house your sons built? I’m happy with you. Happy. Let’s toast father’s health. Pour some wine. To your health. I’m touched. Here’s to you. Here’s to a long life. To a long life. Give me a cane and a hat. Beautiful, dad, beautiful. Bravo, dad, bravo. Thank you. - Thank you. - Bravo. Why did you get up there, son? Careful, the branch might break. Janusz, take the cat. Mum and I are going shopping. Watch Kuba so he doesn’t chase the car. And I left the house opened. And remember to wash it down with compot. - And herbs at two. - He’ll scratch me. Marynia and I are going shopping. You need something? Dad, we’re going shopping. Is there something you need? A saucy blond. Come off it, at your age? Janusz, keep an eye on dad. Keep an eye on dad. I’ll move you into the shadow. There. Here. Break. Done. She’s here. She’s putting soap on, I have time. Dad, you want to see something cool? A saucy blonde. Come on. The Empress. - Good morning, mum. - Good morning, son. You’re washing again? I wash his things every day. I wonder, who needs your ordeal, who needs his suffering. - Someone out there… - But who, mum? Who? You don’t even know, son, how much I love you. Here, Aza, here. What do you need this pyramid for, son? So much work and so much money. What do you mean, mum? I think that phenomena that occur in 1/3 of the height of the pyramid can be used not only to sharpen razors. What is that on your neck, son? Once, a lightning hit the sand. It’s molten silicon. And this bracelet? It’s copper which I really like. You remember anything from your childhood? - I do. - What did you do? I wanted to blow up my aunt. You wanted to blow up the whole house. Don’t be mad, I’d like to talk to you. Can you hear me? Can you see me? Understand me? You don’t want to talk to me? You don’t want to talk to me?! You’re silent… I will hurt you. You’re scared. Of course, I’m scared. I feel like a rat in a cage. I look at dad and I see myself. Not long from now. Not to worry you but those things are hereditary. We’ve inherited a genetic code. Damn it. I plan my life as short and merry. Everyone says it until a certain age. Wait a little longer. For what? Getting senile? If one could only change that. Control the genes and repair them. You know what it means in practice? Eternal youth! I wish you this with all my heart, dreamer. Thank you, thank you. Do you know, do you realise that your genes are affected by, among other things, cosmic radiation? Radiation? Maybe… Let’s think what else we can do for our father. Daddy, you’ve always said, that to live means to learn, not to vegetate. I’m experimenting. Look, what’s that? A pyramid. A pyramid, a perfect form. Space restricted by four triangles. A pyramid… - A form… - A perfect form. - Space… - …restricted… - restricted… - by four… - by four... - triangles... This space will be favorable to us. This spa… And the cosmic radiation… - and the cosmic radiation... - won’t strike us. - Won’t strike us. - Come, let’s go there. Careful, son, careful. Like this. Careful, careful. Watch it, careful. Lead the way, son, lead the way. We’ll get there son, we’ll get there. All is well, we’ll get there. Let go, son, let go. My turn now. I’ll do it. Light... Light... Our furnace. Your cradle. Destroyed. Oh, traces of Pikutek. Pikutek! Pikutek! What are you doing? Ridiculing your father? No, I’m trying out what I’ll become. So, there is no other way for us? Just this path? For now. The only way to immortality is this, look. Our dogs are with Aza now.
