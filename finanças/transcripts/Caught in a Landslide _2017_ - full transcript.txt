Destruction is as destruction does, but destructiveness means we cared enough. Destructive ways and endless tears, even the realization of unwanted fears. Destruction is, destruction reigns. In a vision of life, a never ending game. How I wish you'd hit me so I can feel the rage, still read the books, still love you, the next page. Destruction is because destruction is real. We are only destruct when we really feel. I am in agony, I am in pain. I want it no other way. For as long as I hurt, then we'll both stay. Destruction is your lips upon mine too and I will love you on and on til you come through. And you lied and you cried and I know you love me. The things you do are a reflection of you. Destruction does as destruction is let and I'll dry your eyes after you have wept. Break me, take me, love me, and hate and we'll still embrace while we're in this state. Destruction is mine, destruction is yours, two broken people, a costly cause. And you don't want to cry. Your heart wants to not beat but destruction is mine and it's your love I keep. Destruction burns, destruction holds on, either way you want to look, it's the love, hate so wrong? It's so messed up but it feels so real. If you took my heart then it's yours oh still. Destruction creates, destruction takes, destruction's ours until we both break. It was written in stone, it was on the wall and we can't escape the damage because it's too tall. Destruction is you, destruction is me. It happened now, so we'll never be free. You can run and so can I, but it will never remove all the tears we cried. Destruction is me and you. Destruction my love, through and through. And I guess I'm sick because I'd do it all again. The only question now is where and when. I'm so fed up of the never ending forest that I see upon my ceiling. I'm tired of all the places that are no longer accompanied by the faces. I'm lonely. I'm lovesick. You met him by the hospital bed, a fictional lie one from within your head. You said the words, you had to stick. It wasn't him, it was you that was sick. I hate those lies, hate how I'm blind, but I'm sick enough to love your mind. You'll eat my heart and chew my brain, loving you, how could I abstain? I hate your lies, but I'm still listening. After the war, again we're kissing. I'll chase you, just like you chase me. I'll taste you, just as you taste me. I hate those lies, hate how I'm blind, but I'm sick enough to love your mind. What do you give me? Absolutely nil. But I'll keep going, love you still. You love me, you know you do. It's okay because I love you too. I'll save you when you feel mental because to feel your pain is my essential. Nothing makes me come like a loving stream we've destroyed each other. It's serene. I'm your item or at least you think mind games, cat and mouse, that's our link. You miss me and I miss you, but what do we miss? There's nothing to do. We've killed each other. We went too far. Love extremities, we raised the bar. I hate those lies. I hate how we're blind, to a love so sick it crossed a new line. Why do I feel we'll both never be free? We'll destroy each other to the 10th degree. (cap striking floor) (exhaling) (gulping) (exhaling) (gulping) (swallowing) And you called it destruction. I remember, stood there, looking me right in the eye, and you said to me, we are so destructive. And that's when I left, along the long country roads with destruction still reigning in my mind. Through the tunnel, with the amber glow, all the way home, to where I'm stuck now. Back to old habits, cheers. (gulping) (sniffing) (gulping) I keep seeing that bridge in my mind, but I don't see it at nighttime anymore. I don't see the last duck swimming off into the moonlight. I see everything in daylight, where you can see all the rust and the chipped paint of my childhood retreat that I shared with you. Can see the moss growing. And it doesn't look so attractive. Throughout that glow of the moon, I see everything. I see everything, but not in the way it should be. Some version of events that's been tainted. England's garden is wilting. Greenhouse have been left to rot and die. But I want the real glory back. I want to feel that sun on my skin. You took that from me, something so perfect, detonated, with our destruction. ♪ Come on baby, let's get down ♪ ♪ And fuck it up tonight ♪ ♪ I know together we will never get this right ♪ ♪ I know by the time the moon and it's daylight ♪ ♪ We'll be in another lonely fight ♪ ♪ So come on ♪ ♪ Fail with me ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ I said come on ♪ ♪ Fail with me ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ I don't really know you and you don't know me ♪ ♪ So how can we possibly ever see ♪ ♪ I don't think that we'll last together through this ♪ ♪ I don't think we'll get married ♪ ♪ I don't believe in bliss ♪ ♪ So come on ♪ ♪ Fail with me ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ I said come on ♪ ♪ Fail with me ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Fail with me ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ I said come on ♪ ♪ Fail with me ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ (sighing) Jay. Are you all right? (chuckling) What. I'm sorry. What, I didn't mean anything, I didn't, there's nothing. It was nothing. I didn't do anything. Nothing happened. It didn't mean anything. I love you. I love you. You asked me if I'm all right. Do I look all right? (whispering) - No. How many more times are you gonna slip into my dreams every night? I don't want to do this every night. I'm so lonely. You know the nights of dreams and you turn up at my door. I've missed you. I've missed you. I've been so lonely at home, on my own, a big bed, every night, I dream about you, showing up at my door. Get off me. You know, this reminds me of something. First weekend I met you, sad little Italian cafe on the corner, smell of the coffee, and you sat across the table from me, with that same look in your eyes. I should have known all along. What do you mean, what look in my eyes? What are you talking about? That puppy look you do. What are you saying? I fall for it every time. And here you are every night, giving me that same look. What are you saying? I'm not lying to you. I'm not lying to you. I love you. I mean it. Nothing happened, we, (sighing) but, nothing happened, okay? I'm with you, all right? I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm not lying to you. I'm with you. Why are you looking at me like that?

(gulping) Jay, I need to speak to you. (whispering) I love you. I love you. Would you just shut the fuck up?! (laughing) Why do you listen to me? Come in here every night, invading any sleep that I manage to fucking get. Always the same, isn't it? Sorry. I love you. Oh how much you miss me. It's all self-indulgent. Are you actually sorry? Cause I tend to spend most of my nights here listening to you go on about how lonely you are, about how much I need to come back. Is that for you? What about me? What about my fucking loneliness? What about the fact that I am on my own dealing with this shit? At least you got to walk away with the memory that I actually loved you, that everything I said was actually true. You unknowingly saved my life. Before meeting you, drinking every night, sedatives, and then I turn up in a small village or maybe you'd disappear together for a summer, no one else around, just me and you. And we'd get to know each other completely or so I thought. But walking got easier. My breathing got easier. You made me healthy. You had everything I wanted, every dream I spoke of that you wouldn't recognize, that we could be and we could have anything. A house one day, marriage, walking off into the sunset together. It sounds like the stupidest bullshit romance story ever. And I was stupid enough to truly believe it. I was going to walk in greens garden with you, forever, just me and you. Thanks for fucking up my visional life. I know what love is. But do you? What is it? What's love? [Jay] Mmhmm. Love? That night you took me to the blue bridge, that amazing, amazing night, you took me to the blue bridge. For the first time in my life, I felt true serenity. When you held my hand, and the moon shining on that, the light bouncing off that stream while we were together, just me and you, just me and you, nobody else. That night was like Heaven on Earth for me. That was love. I felt love that night. That night was incredible. It was the best night of my life. It's just, It just seems so unreal. I've never experienced that before in my life. You're my whirlwind, okay? You kind of bought into my life like a whirlwind. I didn't know, I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to react to those feelings, okay? I've never experienced that before. It seemed so unreal. It was like Heaven on Earth, that night with you, it was like, stepping outside of reality. Yes, I do, I love you, man. You're my beautiful, beautiful, handsome guy. I love you, okay? And that was amazing, that night was incredible. That's what love was for me. That was true love to me. And I'm sorry. Is that just cause someone shat all over your dreams once upon a time? Shit life of mine and the the abused does indeed become the abuser. You think we were living inside of a dream? Well I'm living inside of a fucking nightmare now. And you're my ghost. (gulping) Fuck off. I don't care. I'll find someone else. Easily done. You did. This is temporary because pain is temporary, right? It won't last forever. Just nothing else does. Yeah, fuck off. Fuck off, out of my head. Take your summer walks and your blue bridge and your persistent haunting me, stick it up your fucking ass. I don't need you. I never needed you. That is a crock of shit.

If I turn on my front, I could just lose oxygen and then float lifelessly. But they said, you can't drown yourself in a bath. I just seem to float, just carried by the tide. Every little piece of me has succumbed to the died. But they said, you can't get anywhere unless you try. As I float, you seem to float behind me, no matter how much I try to paddle the stream to get away. Why do you float behind me still? I really don't know why. You seem to float in your own way, chasing me downstream. I'd have thought you'd given up and died a bit like me, but they say you can't drown yourself in a bath. We seem to float competitively to get away, but we chase at the same time. How does that even work? How can you want to swim, but give in to floating? You can't drown yourself in a bath by force because the lung's breath will bring you out. So you float by my side. You did once. Now we just limbo along. How long does this go on? You know, this limbo along? You can't drown yourself in a bath, but I'll try if you do. Let's refer to it as a message in a bottle how am I here going to saint? How many floating tides will bring a misery message to me? You drown yourself, not because of me. That was your shipwreck. Your floating is you as you seem to want to drown upon me. I bottomed your water once until you defied me. And you know, I really can't drown myself in a bath. For a time I didn't float. I drowned and drowned and drowned, not in a bath, don't be stupid. It was an ocean, a merciless tsunami. We sat naked in the tub once and I held you by candlelight. You seemed to float. You float to me. I reject you. I don't want to. I have to. How many times did you push me upstream? If love was a bath, then you forcibly drowned me time and time again. You see, in a bath, you can't float so well. There's not enough room, especially with two of us in the tub. The gentle soft bath, so corrupt, you can drown me in a bath, but I can't hold my own head under. You seem to want me to pull you to shore to stop this floating. Every time I needed pulling to shore, something else required your devotion. But maybe you can drown yourself in a bath. I wanted to stop floating. I still do. The stream just carries me off, but those cat-like reflexes just pull you up by nature's last breath because you really can't drown yourself in a bath. In the stream you can drown. You can lose energy paddling. We've lost energy. We're sinking. We're drowning. Thank fuck for the stream because you can't drown yourself in a bath. [Man] That reminds me of this woman I used to know. She was ancient uh, when I first met her. And this was back in '85 or '86, I guess. Don't know where I ran into her. I mean, it could have been an AA meeting or something. She never seemed to like me, that I do remember, which wasn't too unusual back that because nobody really liked me. But I liked her for some reason. I think it was because something was on her mind. I ended up at her house. Now, I'm not sure if she had a meeting there or what, but there I was in her powder blue living room with the plastic slip covers over everything like it was 1974 and she had one of those ankle biter dogs, growled at me every time I so much as scratched my nose. Her name was Jean and she made me tea and she was listening to me whine like a baby about all the things going on in my life and problems with the boyfriend, fighting for my job, problems with the parents, and God knows what else. I went on for who knows how long and when I finally ran out of steam, she didn't say anything. I mean, she simply reached down and picked up her purse, rummaged through it, and took her keys out. Well honey, I have a full tank of gas and all the time in the world. Let's go out and take care of all these problems. What do you say? I looked at her. I said, seeing as there's nothing we can do about it now. She stared at me, hooked her hand to her ear and said, what was that? I was about to repeat myself when it struck me what she meant. I don't remember very much from 30 years ago, but I remember that and I think about it almost everyday. Jay. Hey, Jay. What do you just need me to do? We can do whatever we want. Let's just do me and you. (crashing) Shut up, shut up, shut up! Jay, it's going to be okay. Just me and you, we can be okay. It can't be okay. Nothing ever goes back to the way it was. That's life. It can, it can. We had an amazing summer together. We can have an amazing winter together. I saw this Christmas market. I imagined me and you holding hands just walking around. We can do that. I want you back. As I sit here, do you know what keeps playing out in my mind? Sunny day. Tom Bridge, High Street, me and you walking along like nothing else in the world mattered. One of our road trips. And I felt you this close to my ear. For a minute I wondered what you were doing and you whispered, unprompted for the first time, I love you. And I burst inside cause I truly believed it. And in that moment, I think you meant it. But, you've always been selfish with your love. Things can change. People can change. Won't you listen to me. I'm not a ghost. I'm real. You can have me. If you're not a ghost, then why are you haunting me? Jay, that vision of life you had, it's not over. You're right, it's not. I live it every night. And it's all shattered to pieces.

Extracted from my sights. Ghost, how come so bitter? Won't you help me get better? You float translucent ghost. Your presence is most profound. Ghost of this time, ask of God your hand, ground. Ghost, I still stood here. I've consecrated these parts, all memories, fixtures, history, protected from the start. Ghost, you are so tedious. Why do you still linger? Is it because I summon your spirit while you don't lift a finger? Ghost, glow, specter, whatever is your name, I keep repeating this ritual and nothing ever changed. Ghost, stop this haunting. Stop shifting into shapes for as long as you haunt me then there's more to contemplate. Ghost, I am here with the hollowed ground beneath my feet our loss is still my tension and the grinding of my teeth. Ghost, after you're gone, your loss I am lamenting. The daydreams I'm left with are from stories I'm inventing. Ghost, your touch is ice. Will it ever again be warm? It's the torment of this haunting that has me gaunt and worn. Ghost why did you come? What message do you deliver? What frightening revelation will give me that spinal shiver? Ghost, I have no crystal ball, no talent for me to read. If anything is left unsaid, then you must take the lead. Ghost would you speak or at least move around the letters of the Ouija board? Don't just appear nightly, then leave me all ignored. Ghost, yes you haunt me, yes, you confuse me with a loitering hush, but silence and attendance won't help me. It's simply not enough. Yes, you ghost, it's you who sweeps in, you who forgot me although I still feel you on my skin. Hair standing on end, I'm not fabricating, it's still you, ghost, who has me inside breaking. Ghost, I'll drink tonight, some hell, some haunt, some timeline of events, then right back to the start. Ghost, stop looking at me. You don't feel the same. I'm ice cold chilled and there's torment in my brain. Ghost, you won't say it. You won't declare. You are the ghost, so why be scared? There's so much to say. Ghosts must dig deep and before you apparition, waiting by your feet. Ghost how long has it been since you've been of mortal body? Why be a spook when it makes me melancholy? Ghost, you are my future, you are my present and my past. These hauntings are spectacular, their effect just seems to last. Ghost, poltergeist, moving thoughts around my mind. Ghost, your light, does it lead me blind? Ghost, I misspoke, I will set my soul free. Ghost why with you can that never be? Ghost, it's terrifying, it's frightening and insane. Ghost, it's me, I'm here. Do you even know my name? Ghost, you are all seeing, all knowing, or supposed to be, so ghost, what is my future? What will happen to fumble me? I crawl the holy ground, the filthy mud sinking. Why can't this specter just tell me what it's thinking? I rub the frozen ice before me to see what has been etched wondering if the words will reverse the diamond and the wretched. Ghost, I sit before you, possessed by the unexpected, thinking of the possibilities that have been neglected. Ghost why do you still creep around these lonely parts? Ghost, you are translucent, so I can't see your heart. Ghost, can you tell me, do you believe in resurrection? Ghost, do you truly have any real affection? Ghost, do you have too much pride that you can't tell me truths? Or ghost is this nothing more than a good old fashioned spook? Jay. Jay. You can wake up now. You can get up off the floor. You've been laid there too long. It's time to get up. You don't have to feel guilty about how you're feeling. It's fine to feel that way sometimes. But all these things you see, while you're intoxicated, and drifting away, they're not real. The ghost that sweeps in, he's not real. He just says all the things that you want him to say, all the apologies that you'd wish you had. All the memories, they're not how they were. They're tainted. They're teasing you. The blue bridge, the woods, all the locations that you spent last summer in, none of it's real. Not anymore. Jay, it's time to get up. It's time to heal. It's time to be free. In life, we all have so many visions of how we want it to be. We all meet people that change our worlds. They give us possibilities. They give us hope. And when they don't come through, our world just seems to shatter. Too long have you spent detesting yourself. And all that glitters is not gold. It only felt good because it made you forget you. And as he became a ghost and the summer turned to winter it left you with only you. It's time to love yourself. It's time to move on. Because you can't change the past. And even if your ghost returned with an apology, they would never be the same again. Jay, get up off the floor. You will never see him again. (gasping) (hyperventilating) I half drifted off today, a near deep sleep, a rare relaxing sensation of serenity. As you crossed my mind, even in my zoned out state, a gut wrenching painful vision came to mind, profoundly hurtful. I'm never going to see you again. Yes, I will never see you again. For the rest of my days, living, breathing, my one shot at life. I will never see you again. Do you know how that cuts like a knife? Do you understand how much my heart knots? How my stomach trembles and agony zaps into my mind as I try to picture your face? I'm never going to see you again. Do you know what it's like to realize in a moment the time and the ways, the way we held hands in the woods, the way we did charity shop weekends, hunting for those bargains? The way I look at you in bed and you'd look at me before we made love between the sheets. The loving way I would play with the hair upon your chest again? The way I'll never lay my weary head upon your lap as you twitter with my hair, trying so hard to rid me of the vertigo, that from time to time leaves me unable to walk. I don't want to forget those woodlands. I don't want to forget the skies of the beautiful British summer. I don't want to forget the last minute supermarket sweeps to plan our dinner together. Remember the way, like savages, we'd ravish the entire contents of an ice cream tub? Do you remember the late to bed after relentless hours of video searching for ghost clips and ultimate fails? I will never see you again. To me, that sentence as such has never really sunk skin deep. I will never see you again. I will never share a shower with you as you wash my back and I wash yours. When I wash your back, every stroke of skin was connection between me and you. Every cuddle, every comforting arm wrapped a shoulder, every leg bare into the moment. I will never see you again. The very words eat away at me because until today, I never dreamed I accepted the meaning, the reality that for as long as I breath, it will be without you. You will never see me again. Will you miss the way I turn from serious to loving, to fighting for our lives? Will you miss me as you once did pulling up on the road in my red car? Oh, I remember. I remember a day when you walked towards my car. Love was across your face. No one ever looked at me like that before. Will you miss the loving whispers between us? The way we said goodnight before bed? Will you miss not being able to regulate the loving words that spilled from my mouth for you? Do you miss those trips to the shops? For the dinner? For the ice cream? Do you miss having someone to hold you when one of your disgraceful migraines came about? Do you miss me? I'll say it again. I'll say it for us, for everybody, so everyone can really stop for minute and feel these words. We will never see each other again for as long as we both live, for as long as we walk the unexpected steps of the Earth. We will never look into each other's eyes. We won't get those loving glances. We will be affected by time as it diminishes the memory little by little, lot, by lot. We will never see each other again and what a crime for two people so in love. My first letter is to remind you about our cause, the ones that started it all, the way you'd pacify the struggles I'd endured, the way we would speak for hours or more. Each day was a blessing for the glimmer of hope, the endless possibilities for the two of us both, the excitement that we'd meet, the chance of an us, maybe a normal love life and all of that stuff. You'd come out of nowhere, a blessing perhaps, a strong communication would never elapse. The talking til three, still knowing we'd meet. The ringtone going off, my romantic goodnight treat. I'm no slow paced guy. I see what I want. It was written on the wall in a readable font. You made me laugh. You had me bought. It was you I had been searching for, you I had sought. We talked of the damages that people do. You told me the stories of what you'd been through. The lies that seeked the ones who hurt you, I wanted to change it. I knew what to do. The approach of the meet was coming around fast, a two day weekend, damn, I hope it lasts. I felt I already knew you. We'd spoken so much. I knew we had something that churned in my gut. A morning came by as I loaded the car. It was a fair old journey, but not really that far. You're worth it all. That every mile in the flesh and person I witness that smile. The butterflies flapped. I was a teenager again. I can still feel the feeling I felt way back when. The wheels turned and the music roared. I'm coming my boy, the acceleration was floored. I saw the tall bridge, up in the distance, this was a site that would be minor existence. I knew we had clicked. I believed in fate. I was falling, I was falling, this wasn't a date. The car pulled up, the nerves were shot. This whole body of mine had seemed to get hot. You came down to meet me, my savior, my man, we can be who we want, we really can. Time ticked by as we sat and talked, all mapped out, just as I'd thought. I didn't know then what I know now, destruction laid ahead, but I didn't know how. Within hours we kissed, a perfect moment in time, hidden disguise of how perfect a crime. That kiss sealed the deal. We'd never escape. I came to the surface and I grabbed the bait. In that moment, you didn't know, just how fast it went that would seem so slow. I loved you that night. I showed you upon our bed. Both of us unaware what we do to our heads. Three days of glory just seemed to fly by, sat beneath those trees of ours underneath a possibility sky. Two fools romance, what have we done? We are not 15. We are no longer young. Italian cafe around the corner, you should be at work, but I didn't want you to go, because goodbye always hurt. We chatted and giggled, a moment lost in time. I've been waiting for you, and you are divine. I left in the early hours, the motorway still dark, you still slept, but this was only the start. I'd be back next week, I'd never leave your side. It was never my intention to fall for your lies. I remember the cold of the early morning drive, very little sleep, but I felt so alive. I had claimed you, you'd claimed me. I reiterate again that we'd never be free. You hid behind the mask of confusion. I lived in hope which equaled illusion. I'd be strong for you. I'd be with you always. It had been my life you'd unknowingly saved. This was the start. You called me whirlwind back in the day when I was the king. I had the energy to carry us both. Fuck what they think, we'll go and elope. Beauty becomes pain. Pain becomes hell. Bondage is the binds, the holders in this cell. We didn't know, we didn't expect, just how much the two of us could possibly wreck. Love, Jay.
