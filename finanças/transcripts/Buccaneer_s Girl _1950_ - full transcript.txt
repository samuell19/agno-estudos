- Is everything to your liking, ma'am? - It's an unusually cheerful spectacle, Captain Martos. - Well, when we be calm like this, we might as well enjoy ourselves. - When I arrive in New Orleans, I shall enjoy myself. But not until then. - That pirate Baptiste, he has an obsession with her. Every strange sail we sight calls for a fresh bottle of smelling salts. - Why, ma'am, you couldn't be safer if you were in your own drawing room. In a calm like this, no pirate could ever get to us. Not even Baptiste. - Fetch me that feather, Tom. He's better than what we got. - Aye aye, sir. - Four bells and all's well. - Pirates! Pirates! - Baptiste! - Mr. Roberts, you guard the ladies. You men arm yourselves and get on deck! - Well, thank ye, son. - Thank you, son. - Don't let them forget that China silk, Tom. - Aye. - And did you fetch along the fiddler? - He went to the spice bales. - What do you intend to do with us, pirate? - Set you adrift into small boats along with the passengers. Unless there's any amongst you who'd volunteer. - Think you any of my men would serve with you? - Not a lad amongst us hasn't served on a vessel with Alexander Narbonne. Tell that to your master, if your small boat's lucky enough to be picked up. - At the same time, I'll request the privilege of being present when Narbonne has you hanged from your own yardarm. - Why bother Narbonne? I'll invite you myself. Now, how many of you men would rather transfer registry than hit the small boats? - Small boats always make me queasy. - I'll take the skull and bones. - So will I. - Wise lads, Captain. - Here be one we missed. - Better drag him out. - Easy with them powder casks. - Aye aye, sir! - Strip the rigging clean. - Aye aye. - Looks like we're all through. Scuttle 'er. Weigh below and make sure she settles fast. - Here's something we found. - Well, a cabin boy, eh? Well, son, would you like to sign on with Frederic Baptiste? - Speak up, can't you? - Well, lower me jib, a bustle. - Very nice to meet you. - Is this new gear on all the Narbonne craft? - How did you get aboard? - It was easy. But if I had known you were going to get your moldy old ship captured by a gang of cutthroats, - I'd have stayed in Boston. - Stowaway, eh? - Put her in the boat with the other women. - Pulled away. - Then she'll have to go in the longboat with them. And get going before I change my mind and make you swim back to New Orleans. - Come on, you. - Wait a minute! I've got two dresses in that boat and I'm not leaving without 'em. - You know, he's making a big mistake putting one woman in with all those men. - You wouldn't be thinking... - That she'd be safer with us? Precisely. - Oh, no, you don't. - Ah, it's all for your sake. - Ah, let me down, you big ape! - Ape! - Oh! - You near scratched my hair off! - Good. - You just don't know how to handle a lady. - Ahh! - See what I mean? - If you don't put me down... - Imagine all those poor defenseless men alone in a small boat with a dangerous female like this. Here. Take her. When I get down in the boat, hand her to me. - You just don't know how to handle the ladies. - Ouch! - Quiet. - Help me, Kryl, help me. - Keep her quiet. - Ow! You near bit me ear off! Ow! Take her, Kryl, take her! - You little devil, you. Ah, you think my hands are bloomin' zebra skin? - Touch me again and I'll bite your arm off. - We gotta get her below decks before the other boats get back. - You and your wonderful idea. We should have dumped her overboard. - Quiet! Whatever you have up there, bring it down here. What goes on out there? - Let me down. Let me down. - By the Dog Star, a female! - I've been kidnapped. And I demand that you... That you do something about it. - She was stowed away aboard the Gulf Queen, sir. But somehow, she got herself on our boat, sir. - I'll discuss that with you later. Meanwhile, leave her here. - Aye aye, sir, with the greatest of pleasure. - Turn around. - Who are you? - The captain of this vessel. - But I thought... Then who was the other? - Jared, my mate. Fortunately, many people make the same mistake. - Then you must be... - Frederic Baptiste, a bloodthirsty pirate. The scourge of the Mexican Gulf. That fiend in human shape. At your service, mademoiselle... up to a point. - Somebody's been exaggerating. - Or maybe they haven't. Look what your men have done to me. - You'll find ointment in that chest, Miss, uh... - Deborah McCoy. Debbie, they call me. - Where were you headed, Debbie? - Oh, New Orleans, Rio. I wasn't sure. - To visit? - No. They say that there are good places for a girl to earn her living. - And this living, how did you propose to make it? - I'm an entertainer. I sing a little and I dance a little. - You know, you combine all the elements of a first-class problem. - Why? All you have to do is put me ashore somewhere. - Oh, and stretch my neck by doing it? - Oh, I know how to keep a tight mouth. After all, they say you only attack the ships of Alexander Narbonne. I don't even know who he is. - The richest man in New Orleans. Or used to be. He'd be a good one to know, wouldn't he? - That depends on one's point of view. - Why do you give his ships your special attention? - That's my point of view. Tell me, how long have you been making your own way, Debbie? - Too long. - No one to help you? - Too many. - I still can't decide what to do about you. - The sailors were given a chance to sign on with you. - I believe I have a more practical solution than that. - I knew you'd think of something. - We'll maroon you on a sand spit. I'm sure you can think of something better than that. - Why, no. It's a perfect way to handle the situation. We'll pick a sand spit on the sea lanes to South America. If you're picked up, you'll get to Rio. And if not, you'll be on a clean white beach, protected by palm trees. You'll soon grow to love it. - Finished, Captain. We stripped her clean, cargo aboard and stowed. Not a bad haul for a ship her size. These must be worth a fortune. - I thought I ordered you set adrift. - Oh, you did. But somehow the orders got mixed up. - You better find a cabin for our passenger. - A cabin? - Anything will do. She'll only be with us until we sight a suitable sand spit. - But I thought... - Good night, Debbie. Sleep as well as you can. - Away with you. - Another four days and that girl will have them wearing lace on their drawers. - Yeah, it's a fair shame, sir. It's always been me pride we had the roughest and dirtiest crew in the Mexican Gulf. - I can't stand to look at it anymore. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Where did you get that dress? - Oh, this? It's just a little old thing Jared rummaged for me in a chest. - Jared, eh? So he rummaged it for you in a chest, did he? Well, take it off. - Oh. Were you taking it to someone? How awful of Jared not to tell me. But after all, she won't know, will she? - I will. - But you'll forget. You'll forget about me and the dress, these last few days, everything. - At least I'll try. - While I sit on my sand spit and remember. - I told you to take that dress off. - All right. You needn't shout. - Not here! - Now look what you've done to the hem. - Afternoon, Miss Debbie. - Good afternoon, Bertram. He's been telling me about his sister. I remind him of her. - He never had a sister. - Oh, the poor fellow. He's had such a sad life. - He's had the kind of life he wants. So have I... up till now. Jared! - Now you mustn't be angry with Jared. - Miss McCoy, you've teased and wheedled everybody aboard this ship. You shot all discipline to shreds and now you tell me how to treat my crew. It's time I put a stop to it. - You'd be wanting to see me, sir? - Cram on full sail. I mean to be in and out of New Orleans before dawn. - Aye aye, sir. - Oh, I hate to think of your running such a risk just to take me where I want to go. - You're not going ashore. I am. And the moment I get back, we head for the Tortugas where you will stay and no doubt do very well. Now go into your cabin and stay there. And take off that dress! - Keep her steady. More gray hairs for Narbonne. It's a pity you won't be there in the morning to see 'em sprout. - He'll be bald before I'm through. Jared. If there's any trouble with that girl, I'll hold you responsible. - Oh, you needn't fret about her, sir. She's locked in the cabin and I have the key right here in my pocket. - Well, I better put it in my pocket. Then I know she won't cause any trouble. - Aye aye, sir. - Cast off. - Uh, good morning, Mama. It's a beautiful morning, isn't it? - So it's a beautiful morning. What about it? - You look tired, Mama. Go inside and rest. - We have no time for rest. The customers are already in the market. We gotta put the rest of the vegetables out. - No, no, Mama, later. - Out of my way. I was wondering when I... - Sorry, but you should have let me out. - So this is where you keep 'em! - Mama, I swear I never saw her before! - After 20 years, you keep a woman in the vegetable closet! - It isn't true. After 20 years, I didn't! - I never saw your husband before in my life. I slept in there last night because I had - no place else to go. - Liar. - Mama. - Hag! - No, no, no. - Oh! - Mama, don't! - Police, police! Please, Mama, no! - Joseph. Hadn't you better go? - If Madame Brizar will pardon me. - Of course. - Police, police, police! Please, Mama. - I wouldn't have your husband on a salad! - He's good enough for me, but he's not good enough for you! - Please, please, Mama! - Please stop screaming for me. I'm here. Now what is the cause of this disturbance? - He hid her in our vegetable closet! - I never saw her before. - He lies! With my own eyes, I saw it. - For 20 years, she accuses me of flirting with every woman who comes through my vegetables. - Because it took me 20 years to catch him. - Believe me, Mr. Policeman, I didn't do anything. I opened the closet door and there she is. - Yes! - Quiet, I can't hear you for the shouting. Go inside. The rest of you, disperse. - Madame Brizar's compliments, mademoiselle. - She wants to see you. - Look, I'm in a hurry. And I'm in trouble enough. - Then you should want to see Madame Brizar. This way, please. Madame Brizar. - Did you want to see me? - Yes. You could be very attractive, my girl. What's your name? - Deborah McCoy. - Stand back a little so that I can see you better. Hmm... not too bad. Not too bad. - There she is. By the carriage. - Get in, Deborah. - Why? - Because that policeman is looking for you. Drive on. - Uh, do you mind if I ask a question? - By all means. - Where are we going? - Home. Come, come, child. In we go. You may put the carriage away. - Yes, madame. - Come, Deborah. Good morning, Toussant. - Good morning, ma'am. Monsieur Narbonne and Monsieur Patout are waiting. - Oh, at this early hour? Well, don't stand there and gawk. Come in, darling. Sit down, child, sit down. Ah... Monsieur Narbonne. Such an honor. - Good morning, madame. I'm giving a soiree for the governor and his wife tonight and Patout has just reminded me that we have no entertainers. You remember my secretary. - Oh, certainly I remember Monsieur Patout. He always brings the check. - No doubt. There was a light-haired girl last time who was unusually pretty if a bit gauche. What was her name, Patout? - Cleo, sir. - Ah, yes. One of my loveliest girls. - Very lovely, despite her unfortunate habit of singing off-key. - That has been overcome, Monsieur Narbonne. She no longer sings. She dances. - Splendid. Then send her along by all means. Well. And who is this? - Somebody who should not be here. Now, make your curtsy, child, and run along. Go on, run along. - So you're Monsieur Narbonne. - Well, hello. - Hello. - I've heard a lot about you from mutual friends. - Really? How nice. Come, Patout. Nine o'clock this evening, Madame Brizar. - You can leave everything to me as usual. I'll send you a shower of talent and beauty. Hello, she says. Haven't you even the slightest training? - So far I've always done all right. - I've never been so mortified. Perhaps I've made a serious mistake. - Perhaps you have. And then again, maybe I'm the one who's made the mistake. - Hello, she says. - Oh, Toussant. - Yes, ma'am? - Will you tell Delphine and Cleo that I wish to see them? - Yes, ma'am, I tell them. - And don't stoop. Your posture is most unbecoming. - What's the matter with my posture? - It fails utterly to suggest the languid grace of the swan or the more piquant movements of the male partridge. - Good morning, madame. You wanted to see us? - Another affair of Monsieur Narbonne's. Delphine, you will wear the white lace. - But it makes me look so young. - Well, that's what we have in mind, darling. And, Cleo, you will wear the black dress and look your best tonight. Monsieur Narbonne expressed some interest in you. - It worked. I told you if I sang off-key, he'd notice me. - Is he really the richest man in New Orleans? - He's not only very rich, he's very single. Oh, Delphine, Cleo, this is Deborah McCoy, who may stay with us. And now, after I've had my coffee, we'll discuss your qualifications and then I'll decide. Oh, Toussant, Toussant, my coffee in the study, please. - She can take her time over that coffee. I've decided for her. What a lot of time I've wasted living in Boston. - Higher. Much higher. Higher all around. Much higher. This is for the Seaman's Fund brawl next Tuesday night at the Catfish. - Will Monsieur Narbonne be there? - Monsieur never goes to brawls. - When do I get to go where he goes? - Once you've had the rough edges knocked off. Another month and you might be ready for a gentlemen's party. - A man is no different because of his clothes. - Gentlemen prefer another type of girl. Slouchier men want an indifferent type. Practice looking slouchy and indifferent. - After your song, there will of course be applause and then, no doubt, you'll be summoned to the table of your host, Captain Kingston. Now, I will be Captain Kingston. - Good evening, Captain. How about buying me a drink? - No, no, no, no. The approach is much too abrupt. - Well, it always worked before. - Well, maybe in your prosaic Boston, but here in New Orleans, the gentlemen prefer a more roundabout course. Especially Captain Kingston. He's a great favorite of our first families. - That guarantees he'll be a first-class bore. - Debbie, Captain Kingston, as head of the Seaman's Fund, gives these parties to entertain his seafaring friends, not to entertain you. Now, you are Captain Kingston. Observe me. - Ah, Captain. The city has been desolate while you were away. - Fetch me a beer, wench. - The captain only drinks champagne. And remember, we get an extra five percent from the management of the Catfish. - I still think you're making a mistake sending me to a fish fry. My talents belong in the drawing room. - Ridiculous, child. You can't fly until you've walked. Tonight, you will attend the party at the Catfish with the other girls. Once more. - Ah, Captain Kingston. And did you have an interesting trip? - Interesting enough. Except for a brush with the pirate Baptiste. - No, no. You must never mention anything unpleasant. - Unpleasant? - The very name of that monster must be avoided when talking with seafaring men. Especially Captain Kingston. He is a privateer commissioned to catch pirates. Confine your conversation to subjects that are soothing. - I wonder why I'm so sure I'm going to dislike Captain Kingston. - Don't start that again. Besides, you've got to rehearse the song again. Come along, back to work. Back to the piano. Now from the beginning. Are you ready? One, two, three. - You may have bit me ear off! I only wanted you to share a bottle with me. Here. Now you have one all to yourself. - Here, here, here, stop that. Tonight everybody in my place is supposed to be friendly. - That's just it. He's too friendly. I may even report this to Madame Brizar. - Oh, so you're the singer. - I was. In this air, I don't know. - Well, you'll get used to it. Besides, you're late. Why didn't you come with the other girls? - No doubt she had something better to do. Good evening. - What are you doing here? - That's a fine question, eh, Captain Kingston? Asking the host what he's doing at his own party. - Captain Kingston? - At your service, mademoiselle... up to a point. So now you're here in New Orleans to entertain us. - Yes. Oh, it's such an honor you have conferred. I'm so gratified to be at your party, pirate. - Captain! - The city has been absolutely desolate while you were away. - Debbie, will you please remember my neck? - Oh, I shall remember it. Every moment while I'm singing. Uh, you won't go away, will you? - Hardly. - We have so much in common. So many things to discuss, uh, Captain Kingston. - Gentlemen, attention, please. We're about to be entertained by a charming young lady who I'm sure will capture you as she has captured me. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you Mademoiselle... I do not believe I know your name, mademoiselle. - Take a chance. The first name you think of. - Ah, yes, my friends, Mademoiselle Deborah McCoy. - ♪ One good look and you can tell ♪ ♪ That I was brought up very well ♪ ♪ An education gives a girl a certain air ♪ ♪ As the French would say ♪ ♪ Savoir faire ♪ ♪ You want a song ♪ ♪ I have the words for it ♪ ♪ Something light and gay, monsieur ♪ ♪ You want a dance ♪ ♪ I have the steps for it ♪ ♪ Anything you say, monsieur ♪ ♪ I've even learned how to say no, no ♪ ♪ As every lady should ♪ ♪ Yes, everything I've learned to do ♪ ♪ Oui, oui, I've learned to do good ♪ ♪ You want my heart ♪ ♪ You're just the man for it ♪ ♪ I'm the girl for you, I'm sure ♪ ♪ If you want my song, if you want my dance ♪ ♪ If you want my heart, you will have a chance ♪ ♪ Monsieur, monsieur ♪ ♪ Oh, you have but to say the word ♪ ♪ You want a kiss ♪ ♪ I have the lips for it ♪ ♪ If you care to try, monsieur ♪ ♪ You want my love ♪ ♪ I have the arms for it ♪ ♪ That's the reason why, monsieur ♪ ♪ Since I was young, I was always taught ♪ ♪ A lady must obey ♪ ♪ So everything I'm told to do ♪ ♪ I do, oui, oui s'il vous plait ♪ ♪ You have a ring, I've got the place for it ♪ ♪ And you know the place, I'm sure ♪ ♪ If you want my lips ♪ ♪ If you want my arms ♪ ♪ I will take the ring, you can have my charms ♪ ♪ Monsieur, monsieur ♪ ♪ Oh, you have but to say ♪ ♪ The word ♪ - Charming. You were to be wasted in the Tortugas. - You're very kind, sir. But it's no thanks to you that I'm not there now. - Just to satisfy my curiosity, how did you get here? - There are a few questions I'd like to ask you, Captain, just to satisfy my curiosity. - Then I'll strike a bargain with you. You ignore my questions and I'll ignore yours. - If these people only knew that the great Captain Kingston was really... - I think it unlikely they will ever know. Unless you tell them. - But the danger, especially with a price on your head. - Exists only by an odd coincidence somebody who'd been aboard my ship should turn up in New Orleans. - And in that event? - I would use every means to protect myself. - As you all know, our Seamen's Fund came into being some years ago when shipping in New Orleans was at a standstill and our seamen were hungry and jobless. virtually every New Orleans ship owner was ruined by the barbarous acts of piracy of that infamous cutthroat Baptiste. Any ship not destroyed by Baptiste was bought by Alexander Narbonne, who soon controlled all the shipping in these Gulf waters. Unfortunately for us, Monsieur Narbonne chose to man his fleet with crews from other ports. At this time, when our situation seemed hopeless, a friend and benefactor came to our aid. Captain Kingston! - Close your mouth, Debbie. - Ye be a friend of the captain's, beint ye? - I be. - Then why sit alone? Come and join some more of his friends. - My friends, you're all familiar with the terms of my father's will, directing that certain investments be made for the benefit of the Seaman's Fund. Once more, I bring you good news. During the past six months, these investments have shown substantial profits. Tonight, the Seaman's Fund is in a position to outfit three more ships, the captains whose vessels were destroyed by the pirate Baptiste. The gold for this purpose will be turned over to the Seaman's Fund tomorrow morning. - To your health, Captain. - Thank you. And now you're to entertain me. - Very well. Do we sing, dance or fight? - We decide on the way home. - I just be telling the little lady all about ye. - Yes, he was telling me that if anyone could catch Baptiste, you could. - Heaven knows I try hard enough, but he constantly seems to elude me. - Why don't you try standing still for a while? You might catch him. - He's on his way up. Be ready. - Orland. Whip up, Orland! - No, you don't. - Not a sound out of you. Hurry up with him! - Run for it! - Are you all right? - Thanks to your teeth. I seem to recall they're very sharp. - Who were those men? - I don't know, but I know what they were after. My ring. And they got it. I doubt it will make the new owner very happy - when he gets it. - You're hurt. You better get to a doctor at once. - Oh, it's nothing serious. Debbie, you're out very late and apparently in very bad company. Good work, Orland. And now to Madame Brizar's. - Yes, sir. - Easy there. - Those are the first words you've said all evening that make any sense. - Why, Debbie, I thought I'd made everything very clear. - You certainly did. As Baptiste, you sink ships. Then as Kingston, you turn the proceeds into a fund to outfit ships. For people whose ships have been sunk by Baptiste. Very clear. - That does sound a little complicated. Suppose we put it this way. Some people need help, so I help them. And in doing it, I right some old wrongs. - But what if they should catch you? - Then I should be very sorry. New Orleans is such a lovely place. And the ladies in it even lovelier. By the way, Debbie... if you were a man wanted by the authorities and the secret of your identity rested with a certain girl, would you continue to worry about it? - I'd say the girl was the least of my worries. - The others, I'm sure I can handle. Good night, Debbie. - Well? - There's no doubt about it. It's the ring you gave Baptiste. Your initials are on the inside. - So now we've finished guessing. The real Baptiste is dead. - And Kingston must have killed him. - What a pity. But more the pity he didn't die quickly before talking. - Without the ring, Kingston can prove nothing. - I wish I could be sure of that. He flaunted this ring before me in my own house. Whether to inform me that he had more evidence or merely to worry me that he might have, I don't know. - If he had more evidence, he's had ample time to present it to the governor. - Unfortunately, he's much cleverer than you. I used the real Baptiste to eliminate the competition of Kingston's father and the other ship owners. So now Kingston turns pirate, calls himself Baptiste, and employs the same method against me. Eight of my ships sunk and eight others outfitted. It's no wonder he prefers the present situation. - If it continues much longer, he will have destroyed you completely. - Unless we destroy him first at sea, where he should be destroyed. You know, Patout, I rather fancy being a hero, ridding the seas of this new Baptiste. - Well, do you approve? - Not bad, not bad. A few minor corrections. Not bad at all. A little too much rouge, perhaps. Monsieur Narbonne prefers a pale appearance. - It's not rouge. And I don't intend to stick my face in a flour barrel just to please Monsieur Narbonne. - Debbie, please remember when I found you, you had your face in a vegetable bin. Ever since you've been here, I've heard nothing but, "When do I entertain Monsieur Narbonne?" Now the time is here and Monsieur Patout has made a point of asking for your presence. You're suddenly very nonchalant about the most eligible bachelor in New Orleans. - Oh, not at all. I couldn't be more interested. - Then you might show it. To me, of course... not to him. - Any more instructions? - Yes. Stay away from the ladies. Sing your song, retire to your dressing room. - And be particularly pleasant to that little worm. - Monsieur Patout. - By all means. He's very close to Monsieur Narbonne. - And he can stay there. I intend to stay close to Captain Kingston. - Good evening. - Good evening, I'm from Madame Brizar's. - Oh. This way, please. - This should convince you of what you're missing, Captain. There's nothing like it at sea. - Fortunately for my crew. - You can't be that thirsty, Captain. - Debbie. What a pleasant surprise. - That makes us even. I was surprised when I heard you were going to be here. - Why, I wouldn't miss one of Narbonne's soirees for all his ships at sea. - Darling. You better come here and defend yourself. Patout's complaining to Uncle again. - Pardon me, Debbie. A summons from His Excellency, the governor. We will all be looking forward to hearing you sing. - Mademoiselle, the entertainers wait in another room. - I meant no offense, Captain. It's just that I'm so concerned about Monsieur Narbonne and the losses he has suffered. - A familiar complaint, Robert. Why haven't you hung Baptiste? - Ah, Your Excellency, the ocean is vast, the sea lanes many. Where he is, I am not... where I am, he is not. But someday we shall meet. - In the meantime, Patout here is worried. It seems that one of Narbonne's ships is leaving Spain next week with a very rich cargo and he fears... - Forgive me, Your Excellency, but I meant that information to be kept in confidence. If word should get out, well, Baptiste's ears seems to be in as many places as his ship. - Of course, Patout, I understand. Rest assured it will go no further. - Not a soul will hear it from my lips. - Enough of Baptiste. Let's speak of something pleasant. - I'll arrange for the entertainment to begin. I noticed you recognized our singer. - Ah, yes. And I can recommend her very highly. - Oh, so that's who the young lady was. For a moment, I was almost jealous. - Delightful evening, Monsieur Narbonne. - Always a pleasure to see you, madame. - Worked like a charm, even better than we hoped. - The governor himself told him about our ship from Spain and I pretended the governor had breached a confidence. - Splendid, splendid. In that case, Patout, I think we can feel secure that our three ships from Paris will arrive safely in New Orleans. Has our entertainer arrived yet? - Yes, and Captain Kingston seemed quite pleased to see her, which Mademoiselle Villon noticed. - Good. Perhaps we will kill one bird with two stones. Fetch the singer. - Good evening. - Good evening, monsieur. Ah, Mademoiselle Villon. We see far too little of you when the captain is away. - And the captain is away far too often. - I'll take that as a compliment, Arlene. - Or as a warning, Kingston. Remember, a fiancée is not yet a wife. - How very discerning, monsieur. And, Robert, how very true. - Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monsieur Narbonne's pleasure to present a singer who comes highly recommended. Mademoiselle McCoy. - I trust this girl can carry an ear. - Robert assures me she's quite good. - ♪ There's a song in the air ♪ ♪ And you know why it's there ♪ ♪ Because you're in love ♪ ♪ You're in love ♪ ♪ That's how you know it ♪ ♪ Oh, you took the world for granted ♪ ♪ Now you know that the world's enchanted ♪ ♪ And life was... ♪ - What did you do then? - I sent him home, of course. - ♪ There's a cloud in the sky ♪ ♪ But it's passing you by ♪ ♪ And the sky looks blue ♪ ♪ Dreams come true ♪ ♪ Just because he's in love ♪ ♪ With you ♪ ♪ Because you're in love ♪ - without a servant in the house and the general called. - Such a predicament.

Remind me to tell you the time Marshall English came to dinner. He arrived even later than usual. Full of excuses and to think he's unaware of the fact that... - ♪ Dreams come true ♪ Will those two ladies please get out of here and stop disturbing my song? - Can that creature be shouting at us? - I can and I am! - Come. - Well, if I... - Since no one is interested in my song, I'm sure you'll excuse me. - Never in all my experience have I seen anything like this. - Well, what can you expect? She's from Madame Brizar's. - But surely she didn't expect us to listen to her. - Why did you ruin my song? - Your manners, my girl, need correction. - Manners? Is it manners to talk while you're being entertained and to walk out in the middle of a song? - I am not accustomed to such impudence. Kindly leave the room. - And I'm not accustomed to the rude behavior of an ill-mannered snob. - Get out of here, you dressed-up scullery maid. So we're going to talk about clothes, are we? Then let's start with that dress. - How dare you? - Why not? I wore it before you did. - This dress came from Paris. - So Captain Kingston told me. But I didn't like it. Much too gauche. - Liar! - I seem to remember having put my foot through the inner hem. But you'll find it quite neatly mended. - Guttersnipe! - Cow. - Stop! This is terrible! You must stop it. Please! - Good evening, Monsieur Narbonne. It's been such a pleasant party. - Debbie... - Excuse me. - Arlene. - Excuse me. - Captain Duval. - Mademoiselle? - There is something I want you to do for me, Captain, in your official capacity as chief of police. - Mademoiselle has but to command. - Permit me to offer you my apologies, mademoiselle... - The apology, monsieur, is owed to me by someone else. But first, Robert, you and I are going to discuss gowns. Specifically this gown. - I assure you, it was all perfectly innocent. - I can't believe that anyone associated with that creature was innocent. And now, Captain Duval, I would like to resume our conversation without interruptions. - My sympathies, Captain. I'm afraid it has been an unfortunate evening. For you. - So that's what happened. I disgraced you thoroughly. - Well, go on, say it. The best client you ever had and I... - Did just what I always wanted to do. - Why, madame. - How often, when I was a young singer, did I feel just the same way? But slapping the face of the governor's niece? - Oh, no... - Oh, yes. - Well, I don't care if she's his mother. She deserved it. - Of course, her being engaged to Captain Kingston had nothing to do with it. - That woman engaged to... I don't believe it. - Well, for two years, everybody else has believed it. - Two years? Well, he can't love her very much. - Debbie. For all our sakes, forget about Captain Kingston. - And leave him at the mercy of that ill-tempered witch? I couldn't. He doesn't know what he's getting himself into. - Doesn't that apply to most husbands? Who can that be at this hour? - Open! In the name of the law! I'll take care of it, Toussant. - Open! Open, I say! - Have pity on my door. What do you want? - We have a warrant for the arrest of Deborah McCoy. - Mercy. What has she done? - She is charged with assault on the person of Mademoiselle Arlene Villon. - Well, she's not here. - Keep them out as long as you can, Toussant. Go on, get out of here. - Where will I go? - What's the difference? Just make sure they don't find you. Hurry, hurry, hurry. - Open! Open, I say! - Here. You've no time to get dressed. Wait. Here. Put this on and out of the window. - Upstairs. Halt! Come back here! - Sorry, I have a previous engagement. Ahoy there! Ahoy! - Who be here and what do you want? - Good evening, Jared. - Oh, no, not you again. - I knew you'd be glad to see me. - You can't come aboard in that fashion. Do you want to start a riot? - I just did. Is the captain aboard? - No, and if he was, he'd probably toss you - back into the sea. - I doubt it. You see, Captain Kingston and I know too much about each other. When he comes aboard, tell him I'll be waiting in his cabin. - I warn you, the master won't like it. - He'll like it. - Wasn't expecting you before daylight, sir. - What do you think it is now? - Daylight. - Make ready to sail. A Narbonne ship is due. - Aye, sir. Only, there's a lady... - If you're interested in a lady, you can see her when we return. - It isn't me, sir, it's the lady... - Stop chattering about ladies. I've had enough of them tonight to last me a lifetime. Weigh anchor before we miss the tide. - Aye, sir. Hands! Raise up the sail. Away, you lubbers. - Good morning. - Oh, no. - I hope you enjoyed yourself at Monsieur Narbonne's. - For hours, I've wanted to get my hands on you. - Why, Frederic. - To choke you! - I've never known you to be so violent. - Why in the name of seven red devils did you have to mention that dress? - I'll answer that when you tell me why your charming fiancée broke up my song. - We're not talking about her. - I am. And in the days to come, I'll tell you many things of her. Each one worse than the last. - And what makes you think I'm going to let you stay here? - I'm afraid you're going to have to, Frederic. You see, the police are after me. And you of all people wouldn't want to be in the hands of the police. - So now it's blackmail. - Oh, no, Frederic. Devotion. - I'll have a cabin prepared for you. - My usual one, if you don't mind. - Quartermaster, watch your helm. - Aye-aye, sir. - Bring her to until she's trim. - Luff a quarter point. - Luff a quarter point. - When you raid the ship, Jared, don't forget to select a dress for me. - Maybe you'd like to board her with us for a fitting. - If this wind holds, we'll be off the Floridas in the morning. - We'll lay to and wait. - Are you planning to vote the governor a share of the hull, Captain, for giving you the information? - What information? - That's none of your affair. When we sight the ship, you'll go to your cabin and stay there. - All right. You don't have to tell me. I know all about it. With my very own ears, I heard Monsieur Narbonne tell Patout that he was expecting three ships from Paris. - You heard him say what? - That he was expecting three ships from Paris. - What a fool I've been, Jared. What a fool! They set a trap on me and used the governor to spring it. - Then there's no ship from Spain? - Of course there's a ship from Spain. Probably a converted man-o'-war armed to the gallows and ready to blast us to the bottom of the sea. Alter course, Jared. Narbonne can have his ship from Spain and we'll have his ships from Paris and hoist him by his own petard! - Helm, hard-a-larboard. - Hard-a-larboard, sir! Away there. Raise the topping lift! Watch your wind. - Debbie. Remind me to buy you some earrings for those sharp little ears of yours. - I will. - Sail, ho! - Where away? - Two points off the larboard bow, sir. - Make it so. Prepare for action, Jared. She's flying the Narbonne flag. - Aye, sir. Forward main braces! - Forward main braces! - Alee, bring her to! - Show them who we are, Jared. I'm going below. Debbie, go to your cabin. - And miss all the excitement? Not me. - You heard the captain's orders. - So did you. Show them who we are. - Hoist the Roger! - Pirates! Man the guns and prepare to repel boarders. - Man the guns! Prepare to repel boarders! - Gun toggles away! Clear vents! Ho! Set and ready, sir. - Prime guns. - Prime guns! - I thought I told you to go to your cabin. - Who are you supposed to be? - Baptiste, the cutthroat. We disguise the ship when we leave New Orleans. I don't want to be recognized either. - Then why don't you stay in your cabin? - Because I belong out here, but you don't. Take her as she comes! Break her. Fire! - Fire! - Ho! - Stand by! Hey, fasten those! Prepare the bow hence! Three on the masthead! Fight them off! Boarders away! - Not bad, Captain. Daring, but late. And now, Captain, we can discuss things calmly. - How long before they make land? - A few days. But they're well-provisioned. That's another secret you've got to keep, Debbie. I'd lose my standing as a pirate if word got around I spared my victims' lives. - There she be. That's one for Davy Jones and two more a-coming. - And this makes two! - And still another to come! There she be. - Jared, an extra ration of grub for the men. Make it three extra rations. One for each ship. - Oh, I could use a bit of grub myself. I guess I'm not cut out for this occupation of pirating. - That part of it's all over. We sail for Martinique to sell the cargo, and then, Debbie, we go home, to New Orleans. - Alas, drink up! - No sleep tonight, Debbie? - No. - If you're worrying about the police, don't. I can take care of that ridiculous charge the moment we land. - What can you do about this being our last night out? - All voyages must end sometime. - Why? You could just turn this ship around and keep on sailing. - You forget my friends at the Seaman's Fund. And my business with them. - To say nothing of Mademoiselle Villon and your business with her. - That too, Debbie. I'd hoped you'd understand. - I don't at all. But I know what you're going to say, what you've been leading up to for the past three days. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it go something like this? "Uh, Debbie... "this is a difficult moment for both of us, "but one we have to face. "Now, being together these past few months "has made us forget everyone but ourselves "and led us to believe that everything has changed, "but tomorrow, we land in New Orleans, "we meet our old friends "and discover that nothing has changed. Least of all, my feeling toward Mademoiselle Villon." - That doesn't sound very pretty. - Perhaps you could make it sound more attractive. - No. No matter what words I use, the meaning would be the same. I'm sorry, Debbie. I hope you'll forgive me. - And I hope that you. That'll you'll be very happy. Four bells and all's well. - That's what you think. - Captain Duval, there's a Captain Kingston to see you. - Show him right in. Welcome home, Kingston. I hadn't heard you were back. - We dropped anchor this morning. - Any sign of Baptiste? - None. - Mr. Narbonne is not so fortunate. We lost three more ships. Bad business. Well, what brings you here? - I have a small favor to ask. It concerns a girl. - But you only anchored this morning. - This occurred before I sailed, some trifling charge. Assault, I believe. But I feel a certain responsibility in the matter and promised to help her. - And her name? - Deborah McCoy. - Oh, that one. Now I understand. - Understand what? - Why the charges were made and why they were dropped. Consider the matter closed, Captain. The complainant requested the same favor. - She did? - Of course. Right after her marriage. As Madame Narbonne, she recognized it was most unseemly for her to be jealous of anyone but Monsieur Narbonne. - You are speaking of Mademoiselle Villon. - Of course. Forgive me, Captain. I assumed you would have been the first to have heard. It appears I made a dreadful mistake. - Apparently I have been saved from making a greater one. - Robert! This is a surprise. - It is a day of surprises, madame. My belated best wishes to you and my congratulations to Monsieur Narbonne. - No anger, Robert? That's not very flattering. - At the risk of upsetting you, madame, I find myself less angry than perplexed. - How well you control your emotions, Robert. But you did come to see me. And I must confess I'm pleased. - A minor confession, madame. - No other is important. There was always one fault with being in love with you. You could do so well without me. With Alexander, it's different. He needs me. I have the position to go with his wealth. It's a convenient arrangement for both of us. And, Robert, it's an arrangement that needn't too much affect you and me. - When last we met, you were quite violent about a young lady. I was just thinking of the names you called her. - Are you comparing me to that guttersnipe? - No longer, madame. The comparison is too unfair... to her. - Then I suggest you leave here and return to her. - No suggestion was ever more welcome, madame. I called to offer you my congratulations. I now extend my sympathy. - Get out. - Your husband will soon discover you are without honor. You will soon discover he is without wealth. This should be a happy arrangement for both of you. You see, it has been a day of surprises, madame. - Patout... is it true that Alexander is in financial difficulties? - Captain Kingston tell you that? - Does it make any difference who told me? - A great deal, madame, since it is my belief he is responsible for those difficulties. - Kingston? - Or should I say Baptiste, since they're one and the same. - You're out of your mind. - Both your husband and I have every reason to believe this. - Then why haven't you gone to the police? - For one reason, madame, because you and your uncle have always been his protectors. - I would like nothing better than to see him hang. - If madame truly feels that way, perhaps we can arrange that event. We have manifests of all the cargos lost when Baptiste looted our ships. If any of these cargos are found aboard Kingston's ship, we have the proof we need. - I see. Send Alexander to me as soon as he returns. - Madame. Should the charges be preferred by the governor's niece, Captain Duval would act even more quickly. - Of course. And Captain Kingston would be even more unhappy. - We've had an anxious day, Captain, wondering if it would be you or the police who would call on us. I haven't even let Debbie unpack. - It's safe for her to do so, but I'm here to ask her not to. - Why not? Does my presence in New Orleans embarrass you? - On the contrary, New Orleans itself embarrasses me. Therefore, I'm sailing immediately and want you to go with me. - Won't that be a little awkward? You and I and Madame Narbonne? - Then you know. - Yes. Madame Brizar was kind enough to tell me. - At which point I discovered that even a woman doesn't understand women. They're very unpredictable creatures, as you're about to find out. - Debbie, I don't think you understand. There's nothing to stop us now. I'm ready to turn the ship around and keep on sailing. - So now you're ready. Well, I'm not. When you thought you could have Mademoiselle Villon, you didn't want me. Well, now that you can't have her, I don't want you. - I came here, Debbie, because I discovered it wasn't. Mademoiselle Villon I loved. It was you. - And I discovered that I want no part of you. I wasn't good enough for you and your friends last night. Well, they're not good enough for me today. - Debbie, stop acting like a fool. - I wonder what your high and mighty friends would say if they knew that the gallant Captain Kingston was really Frederic Baptiste, the pirate! - Why don't you tell them? - Ahoy, Jared! - Answer him. - Ahoy, Captain. - How fitting that Captain Kingston should be the first to know we have captured Baptiste. - She wasted no time in coming to you, did she? - Did you expect her to?

You see what it has brought you. - If you'll permit me, Father, I see more clearly where a woman has brought me. - I have been to see this Mademoiselle McCoy. She denies having betrayed you and I believe her. - Father, in your calling, you're supposed to believe. Gentlemen, I'm overwhelmed by this honor. - And well you should be, pirate. Monsieur Narbonne has come to offer you mercy. - Monsieur Narbonne's mercy can be more dangerous than his threat. - I pray you'll be generous, sir. - Monsieur Narbonne has come as a friend. And you're badly in need of friends, Baptiste. The governor has refused to see you. Your execution is scheduled for dawn. - It appears that all is fair in love and war and I have lost at both. - Perhaps not. I have come to make you an offer... - Which you are in position to refuse. - I am all ears, gentlemen. - In exchange for a simple statement from you, I'm convinced I can persuade the governor to offer you a pardon on the condition that you leave New Orleans forever. - And what's to be the nature of this statement? - A simple confession that the money you turned over to the Seaman's Fund for the purchase of new ships was really mine, procured by selling my cargo. - The court will then rule those transactions illegal. - And compel the owners of these ships to sign them over to you. - Precisely. - I would like nothing better than to sign such a statement. - But I'm afraid I can't. - Why not? You can't deny that you raided my ships. - I can deny it. In fact, I will deny it. - Then you'll hang. - Too bad. It seems such a ridiculous way to die. - Come, Patout, we're just wasting our time. - Open. - Monsieur. My compliments to your wife and my apologies for finding it impossible to replenish the Narbonne fortune. - She will at least have the satisfaction of seeing you hang. - As well as the reward for having exposed you. - Monsieur Patout! You will never know how happy you've made me. - Line up, all of you. Line up. - What is all this, Sergeant? - The fight at the Catfish, Captain. The information you had was correct. - Lock them up. Merely a routine brawl. - Bring them along. Open up. Come along. Hurry up, move along. - Now! - Mademoiselle, the keys! - Debbie! - Jared! - Quick, where is he? - He's in the next cell. Give me the keys. - Debbie, is it any wonder I love you? - Hurry, they'll have reinforcements here any moment. - If I hang for it, I'll have a kiss. - There'll be time for that later. Come on. - Eight bells and all's well! - How right he is.
