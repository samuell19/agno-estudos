Choices, choices, choices. Hm. Who do I want to be tonight? Yeah. Tina Tarniquet. Tina... Tarniquet. I wonder which band they'll be going with tonight. - Tara, you want anything... - Aunt Rhonda! Can't you knock? Not again. Aren't you a little old to be crashing Christmas parties? And aren't you a little old to be wearing skinny jeans? I look good. You should come with me. It's gonna be a good one. Better than the one you went to last year? You know, with Santa and his shirtless reindeer? Ooh, I think you're talking about... Claudia's Naughty Not Nice Lingerie Trunk Show? - Ooh. Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - Remember this one? - Mm-hm. - That was so nice. - Okay, those are cute. But nothing will compare to the birthday party you threw me last year. I still don't know how you pulled it off in 24 hours with no budget. You know, you could be planning these parties, hon. But I have a computer science degree. If this plan to sneak into the Everest Christmas Party works out, my dating app could be live by next year. Okay, I thought you were givin' up dating until you made your first million. Are we looking for love? - I'm looking for a paycheck. - I thought you liked your job. I code operating systems for dishwashers. Do you know that last year, consumers paid over $5 billion on dating apps? And Elliott Everest is one of the most... influential tech investors in the country. Why don't you just make an appointment at his office? No one like Elliott is going to give someone like me a second look unless I get right in his face. You know, you're brave, just like your mama. You know, she would just take off whenever, um... - Yeah. Whenever work called? - Okay. - That's not what I meant to say. - Mm-hm. You know, she's moving back to town. - No. - Maybe you guys can mend things. You know, patch things up. And maybe Santa can come down the chimney and leave Idris Elba under my Christmas tree. Tara, she's not as bad as you think. Of course not. Because of her, I learned that that the only person I can depend on is myself. Ahem! And you. Let me see what time it is. Oh! Look at that. It's time for me to get ready, and it's time for you to leave my room! Bye! I love you, thank you. Please close the door. Bye. Pull it together, girl. You've worked too hard to blow this. Shoot! Retinal scanners. Oh! Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. - Did I really just do that? I designed it to be stain proof for such tragedies. - Oh, isn't that impressive? - I'd like to think so. So why are you leaving? Uh, I misplaced my invitation. And security is being a little extra. But they should be able to find you on the list though, right? Yeah, but I mean, look at that this line, you know, I'm... I'm in no mood to stand in line with a bunch of people hoping to be verified. Not my problem. Well, I don't believe in problems. Only opportunities. - Excuse me. - Oh, um... I could be your plus one. Maybe, but I don't really do lines either, Mr... Um, Bailey. Tre Bailey. Tina Tarniquet. - Well, Mr. Bailey... - Uh, Tre is fine. I have an idea. A-are you game? Lead the way, Ms. Tarniquet. Tina's fine. Yes, you are. Right here, we'll take off our coats and, uh... put on the jackets. - Make it quick. Make it quick! - Yeah. Follow my lead. Just stay cool. Do you know that he paid with coupons? - No! - Mm! Doesn't he know your bed is not a blue light special zone? You better believe it, my panties are full price and never on sale. Oh, hey, girl. Oh, I love them shoes! Mm-hm. See ya. Keep the pace. Oh, put it right there. Right there. - Great. Great. - You're pretty good. Yeah, well, the panty trick is a great diversion, as long as I have someone to do it with. Most underwear games are. Look, I'm sure that pretty-boy charm has worked with you quite well in life, but I'm not the one. - I apologize. - No need. Just making sure we have an understanding. Okay, we're in, but we're not completely in the clear. Luckily, I saw the wristbands that they were handing out. And I have a few bands for such occasions. So who are you and what are you really doing here? Can you keep a secret? My name is Tara and I design apps. Dating apps. I came to pitch Lord Everest himself. No way! That's why I'm here, too. - You design software? - No. Fashion is my game. I plan on showing my designs to London Everest. She's the... Daughter. Yeah. I follow her socials. Ah. So you know she's a taste maker in the fashion world. One comment or post from her, I can finally get my big break. - The struggle is real. - Yeah. It's just funny to meet a complete stranger who's a friend in "the work." Might say it's destiny. Um, so what do you say we work together to make our dreams come true? - Partners? - Partners. - Ready? Okay. - Let's go. Oh, this way. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wrong way. Check-in is out there. We already checked in. He just had to use the bathroom. - In the kitchen? - Uh, we got lost. But now, we're headin' back to our tables. Where's your wristband, sir? Oh, babe, did you leave it at the table again? Ugh, men, you can't take them anywhere. Which table? And I'll escort you. Not necessary. But thanks anyway! I'm afraid I'mma have to insist, ma'am. We're with London. Hey, Lon! It's Tara! I'm ready to get this place wrecked! - Excuse me, honey. - So you're actually not coming? Babe, come on, you know I'm in football training right now. - What's her name? - Ms. Everest... Really, London? We're not going down this road again. The road of lies leading directly into skank town? Mrs. Everest if I may... I am sick and tired of you always acusing me of cheating Until you learn to trust me, I think we need to take a break. No, Canyon! We're not doing this back and forth again. Either you're in or you're out! Fine. Then I guess I'm out. Fine! And for the record you were never really really inin to begin with. - Ms. Everest - What?! These two claim to be your guests, but I'm not sure they are properly Well, well, London, we met at the yacht party in San Tropez last summer. You posted pics of us and everything. - I did? - It's me sweetheart.Tara. - Oh, Tara? - London. Ohh Mwah. Mwah. You look so good in green girl. Good to see you. Oh, oh, is this your boyfriend? Him? No. This is Tre. He's my... - Cousin. - Mm-hm. Um, single cousin. Oh, I love my very single cuz! Miss Everest, I need to make sure that these two are properly checked in, or Mrs. Everest will have my hide. - Sir, if you'll come with me. - Uh, whoa. Easy. This suit costs more than most cars. - Uh, run along, Maynard. - But your mother... I said, go. Ma'am. Why doesn't the help just, like, help? - Would be so much easier. - Tell me about it. - There was this salesboy... - Soft yet strong. Who, who is this? Ricardo Cordero? No, but I see you have on the Ricardo Cordero pumps. Gucci dress? No. - Ty Voss. - Yes. Ty's a personal friend of mine. You know a lot about fashion. It's what I live and breathe for. Why don't we get a drink and I can tell you more about me? Okay. Let's go, guys. Fillinger, many AR-based ideas eventually become fully functional mobile apps. Listen, let's discuss this later, Sapphy's mad enough that I keep taking work calls around her. See you soon. - Having a good time? - Mm-hm. Your, uh, face, it's a little creamy. Oh. Little more? Mm. Thank you. Thank you so much. You can have that. - Oh, wait, uh, Mr. Everest? - Elliott's fine? And you are? I'm Tara, I'm a good friend of your daughter's. Oh, really? She usually doesn't invite friends to things like these. Maybe I'm not as dull as she keeps telling me I am. I don't think you are. - Have a food evening, Tara. - Thank you. Oh, wait, don't go, um... Ooh... S-sorry, I just, I really wanna show you something. Okay. Well, sir, it's this thing. Well, it's not really a thing. It's like a program. An app. You know when you open your... - Slow down. Breathe. - Okay. Is the app on your phone? C-can you show me? My phone? Yeah! I actually have the beta test right here. Um, so you... Uh... Of course, now it doesn't open, right? I mean, this damn wi-fi. What is this place, Fort Knox? Just call my office and pitch it to my development team. Okay. God, please help me save this! - Mr. Everest! - Yes. Hit the deck! Oh, my God! Darling, are you okay? Nearly decapitated by these dumb decorations you insisted on. These are custom-made one-of-a-kind designs. Can we please not argue now? And to think I was worried you wouldn't have any fun tonight. - Oh. - It's not like that. - This woman... - Um, Tara. Tara Aries. This Tara Aries saved my life. Well, I don't remember putting a Tara Aries on my guest list. Tara's more of a nickname. I'm a friend of London's. - She invited me. - No, I didn't. Yes, you did. Back in St. Tropez. Honestly I have no recollection of who you are or why I would ever invite you to this bore-fest of a party. No offense, daddy. - Maynard! - Right here, ma'am. Would you please remove these uninvited guests? - Yes, ma'am. Sir. - Come on. Maynard, let them go. This young lady practically saved my life. And the way that you say thanks is to throw them out? Um, London, the reason you don't recognize Tara is... Sorry cuz, because she got a nose job. You were actually the one who recommended it. My nose has always been perfect. But that's why I told the doctor to make mine look like yours. Yeah, Tara's nose was an absolute mess. It was huge. Grotesque. - Like an elephant. - Actually, it wasn't that big. I mean, children used to run and hide for cover under their beds for weeks when she'd sneeze. My cousin's such a kidder! Let's get out of here and bolt before they call the police. Uh, b-but, Tre, where are you going? You know, my uncle once told me, "Go where you are celebrated, not where you are tolerated." - Au revoir! - Stop! Did you say Uncle? And your last name is Aries? - Yes. - So you're related to Calvin Aries? Calvin! Calvin Aries is my one of four interior designers Au revoir! I keep on call. I invited him to my brunch but he's in Rio for the next three months. Yeah. You caught us. But really, we must be going. Calvin would kill me if he knew I told his niece to leave. Uh, please don't say a word. My lips are sealed. Oh! Oh, that's my song! I love this song! Let's dance, darlin'! You know I don't dance. Mrs. Everest, you and me, let's go. Call me Sapphire. Mrs. Everest is my mother-in-law. When will I learn that I can't depend on anyone but myself? I'm sorry. I don't mean to complain. No, complaining is one of my favorite past times. What's troubling you? Okay, well, every year, I host an exclusive Christmas Eve brunch, and everyone who's anybody in Atlanta wants to get invited too. That's the social event of the Christmas season. Yeah, well, this year, it's going to be a disaster. My caterer canceled. And then my party planner quits. Due to an ailment in her you-know-where. - Mm-hm, yes. - Ooh! I honestly have no idea how everything just fell apart on me so quickly. I mean, my estate isn't even decorated because all of my designers are unavailable. I mean, why is the world turning on me? What did I do? Mrs. Everest, please calm down. Maybe, maybe I can fill in. That's sweet, Tara. Thank you for offering. But I need someone who can take the reins of everything. You know, the decorating, the catering. It's on a scale I don't think you can handle. Like on a scale of something... like this? I know all there is to know about throwing a Christmas party. London, please, it's not really that big of a deal. It's a very big deal. Mother. Look at Tre's suit. Feel the material. Um, ooh! What is that? Adara? DiCecco? Um, it's my design. And Tre is going to design a dress for me to wear for your Christmas Eve brunch. Why, how nice. If I had to wear that horrid thing from France I brought. Ugh! Gag me now. You mean that $10,000 horrid thing? Oh. I can't till you to waste your own money one day. So, um, Tara, what's the going rate for a party planner? - It varies, you know... - Say 25K cash. All expenses paid. You can stay on-site at our estate. You'll have full use of all the amenities. The pool. Chef. Masseuse. What do you say? Well, I'd say I think it's gonna be a very Merry Christmas! Yes! Yes! Cheers! Cheers! - Mother. - Yes, yes. Oh, uh, don't you think you'll need Tre there? You know, since he's making London's dress and all. Oh, but, of course. That way, you could be with your cousin at Christmas. Perfect. Tara can have my old room. And Tre will sleep in the bed right next to mine. Oh. What's this about house-guests? Daddy, Tara will help mom with her tiny party. And Tre will design me an even tinier dress for mother's brunch. I'm not sure about this, Sapphire. A minute ago, you were mad because I wanted her to leave. Now you're mad because I want her to stay! Is that... I mean, you are a piece of work. - Don't even start... - O-okay, mom. Dad. I'm sorry, darlin', I just can't believe all of this... Ahem. Tara, you sure you know what you're getting us into? You mean, a chance to win their trust? You're welcome. I don't know, it's one thing to crash a party. But to plan one? Well, I planned my Aunt Rhonda's 50th birthday and it was a hit. I've crashed so many parties that planning and decorating this one will be a piece of cake. - Mm. - Ooh! It's gonna be easy. - We didn't get caught. - Mnh-mnh. Wait, where's Wise Man number three? I don't know, I think he got mixed up in the Kwanzaa decorations. Well, I guess we could just improvise with one of the shepherds. Maybe... a little scarf here. And a necklace... there. Voila. Wait... Where is baby Jesus? You're not supposed to display the baby until Christmas Eve. No one should see him in the manger yet. Oh, just like you never saw me growing up? Tara! Show some respect. Diahann's still your mother. How many times do we have to go over this? I never went to college and I had a child to support. When I finally got a sales job that needed me to travel, I had to take it, luckily, Rhonda was able to provide you a stable childhood until I could get on my feet. So what, do you want me to thank you for never being there for me? You know, Aunt Rhonda was more of a mother to me than you've ever been. It hurt to watch my sister raise you while I was trying to make a decent living. Baby, if I could change the past... Why are you back in Atlanta anyway? A new job. And a good one. Director of Communications at a biotech firm. Now that I'm back, I-I hoped we could... - Reconnect? - Yeah. No. I'm not getting back on this merry-go-round that is your life. Hope, then disappointment. Trust, then more betrayal. Do you know I get emotional whiplash every time I think about you? - Baby, I love you! - If you love me, leave me alone. I have a good life now. In fact, I'm gonna spend Christmas with one of the most successful families on the planet. Even if you have to lie to get there? Tara, what kind of trouble are you involved in? I'm not in any trouble. And even if I were, I can get myself out of it. Of all the things she could inherit from you, why does she get my stupid, self-defeating stubbornness? She'll come around. Have faith. You know she's right. You definitely been more of a mother to her than I have. Look, you're my sister. And I know the sacrifices that you've made that Tara couldn't possibly understand. Okay? I just hate that I've put so much on you to step up. - When I couldn't... - Stop! Stop! Stop. Don't you think it's time that we start the healing process? Sis, you've got to forgive yourself first. She'll come around eventually. - Okay? Mm-hm. - You're right, thank you. All right. Go put little Baby Jesus down, girl, help me. Okay, so you pledged Alpha at Howard. After graduation you went to FIT, New York. And the you studied in Milan for a year. - Wait! - No, that's right. No, what if they ask how we're related? - My mom's side or yours? - That's your bag. After all, you already told them our Uncle Calvin is their interior designer. I can't believe I broke my own rule! Never tell a lie that someone can verify. I guess we can just say my dad's side? Which could be the case because he was never in my life. Me neither. Or my mom. Uh, I grew up in foster care. - I'm sorry. - Don't be. My parents were great and raised me as their own. They're celebrating the holidays in Mexico. Don't you want to be with them? The trip was my anniversary present. They got married on Christmas Day 30 years ago. Thirty years? That's wonderful. True story, they got engaged less than a month after they met, real love at first sight stuff. - Come on. Really? - Yes, really! You don't believe in love at first sight? I'm just too practical for all that star-crossed love stuff. - No offense to your parents. - Mm, none taken. So, a-and this is just in case the Everest's ask. But, uh, do you have a boyfriend? Not right now. I vowed to not get distracted by boys and all that drama until my career's taken off. Why does dating have to be full of drama? - Can't it just be fun? - Tre? Oh, my God! Tre! Yoo-hoo! London? What're you doing here? I came in to grab a cappuccino. My psychic is right next door. Well, she's really a pet psychic. But that still works for me since, and you'll never believe this, she says I was a Pomeranian in a former life. Oh, I believe it. Absolutely. She did a very special tarot reading for me today and guess who showed up in my cards? - Who? - She didn't give an exact name. Just that the man of my dreams would declare his love for me on Christmas Eve. I have goosebumps. Then we, uh, we gotta make sure you're looking your best for Mr. Right. By the way, I told my publicist, my Christmas Eve dress is being designed by a very talented and very hot new designer. He's already talked it up to all the top fashion culture sites and mags. Your handmade designs all over my body will make quite the sensation. That's incredible, London. How can I ever thank you? I'll come up with a list. We'll be at your house tomorrow. Um, what's your address? You're such a riot, Tre. I will have my limo come pick you up. Limo? Uh, in fact, um, the limo can pick us both up from Tara's so the driver doesn't have to make more than one trip. Uh, I'll text you the address. Ooh! Wow, I'm late for my nails. Why is being beautiful so time-consuming? I'll see you two tomorrow. Ciao! What's with all the attitude? I feel like I was pretty nice to a woman who used to be a Pomeranian. We still need her to like us. Tara, London is my ticket to a legitimate career. A line of clothes, branding, a store... Okay! Okay. I'll play nice with the dog. What's wrong? Am I really gonna be able to pull off everything that I agreed to? Not only is this challenging, but... but this could be dangerous if-if I screw all this up. You're not in this alone. Remember the pact we made? - Partners. - Right. Partners. Oh, my. Now I see why she doesn't want to spend Christmas with me. Come on in, Tre. This is my Aunt Rhonda. Now, can you tell her how what we're doing is not illegal while I go get my coat? Uh, you have a lovely home. Well, Tara decorated it. She has an incredible eye. Your praise means a lot coming from the fashion designer I've been hearing about. - Is that one of your designs? - This? Oh, no. I mostly do couture. That's where the real money's at. Not that cash is the only reason I got into fashion design. It most certainly helps. May I see your phone? All right, thank you. Okay. There you go. If she needs my help, you call me. - She's like a daughter to me. - She's very lucky to have you. I'm lucky to have her. She's a remarkable young woman. I'm beginning to figure that out. What're you two conspiring about? Oh, I'm just warning him how you're nothing but trouble and aggravation. Ah! Wow. Our chariot has arrived. - Oh, wow. - Let me help you with that. Oh, no, no, you don't need to help me with my bags. Okay, forgive my niece. She has never seen a gentleman in the wild before. You don't need to worry about me. Yes, I do. Unless, of course, you wanna give the job to someone else. Because, I know somebody who really wants it. I don't have time to argue about that woman anymore. Then don't argue. - Just meet your mom half-way. - Mm. A third of the way? A hop, skip, and a jump away? Have a Merry Christmas. I love you. Wish me luck. - Bye. - Bye, darlin'. Oh, boy. Cookies? Thank you. - Thanks. - Mm. Wow. Pinch me and say it's not a dream. - It's not a dream. - Not... - I'm ticklish. - Good morning! Yeah, you must be London's friends. I'm her grandmother, Carolina. I'm Tara and this is Tre. You two make such a cute couple. How long have you been dating? Oh, we're not, we're not together. - We're cousins. - Oh. Mm. Mm-hm. Cousins. We can't touch like that anymore, last thing we need is Sophia from the Golden Girls figuring us out. Remember, it's business, not pleasure. Nice. Oh, wait, I, uh... I got something for you. Here you go, it's a tip. Just gonna try just a little. Oh, I gotta get me some of this. Tara! I only used a little bit, I swear. Oh, please, use all of it! My home is your home. Thank you. Okay, should we get into party planning? - I already made a list of... - Oh, darling. Before we get into all that, why don't you and Tre join us for a light lunch? - Say a half hour. - Okay. Give you a chance to slip into something a little more... appropriate. Okay. "Appropriate?" Oh, how lovely you look. Come, sit next to me! Okay. Ow! Ooh! Here, easy, I got you. Okay, okay, you're makin' a scene. I'm fine, I'm up. Oh! I'm here. We can start now. - Ahem. Um... - Oh. - Sorry, am I in your way? - Not anymore. You gonna rearrange the living room while you're at it? - Tre. - Oh. Smile. Thank you. Thank you. - Tara, aren't you hungry? - Absolutely. But, um, do you happen to have any wings in the back or something like that? Kidding, just kidding, I just... I just love, um... - Foie gras. - Of course. I just didn't recognize it prepared in this style. Do you know foie gras is one of my favorite dishes? - I'm just gonna dig in. - Mm! Mine, too! Not many people appreciate fatty goose liver. Can we talk about the party? We only have three days to get everything together and it has to be luxurious. Young lady, now are you sure you're not in just a little over your head? Mother Everest, Tara is an Aries. I'm a Sagittarius. Who cares? Her uncle is Calvin Aries. My decorator. Oh, I see. Tara, do you spend a lot of time with your uncle? Mm, not as much as I'd like to. I just hope there's enough time to source out all these decorations. Oh, the garage is full of everything the decorators have used over the years. Elliott, can you show her where it's at after lunch? Elliott? Uh... This is business, Sapphire. I can't just ignore these people. Why not? You ignore me. And now Christmas has officially switched to Def Con 2. Tara, it would be my pleasure to show you where we store the decor. Okay, I guess I'll just change clothes again. - Oh, uh, I'll help. - Okay. But you haven't even finished your lunch. Uh, trust me, a little of this liver goes a long way. Uh, excuse me. It's foie gras. Well, here it is. Every decoration for the past ten years. Or 20. Oh! It's not that much of a mess, is it? Unh-unh. I've been begging Sapphy to throw all this stuff out for years, but every time I try to tell her... Tell me what? For you to throw out all this junk. Oh, our memories are junk now, are they? Dear, what can I help you with? I came out here to ask Tara how she's going to trim the family Christmas tree. I think that's where we should start since we're so behind with the decorating. That being said, don't you think the family Christmas tree should be decorated by the family? Thank you! I've been trying to tell Sapphy this for years. I loved decorating the tree when I was a kid. But the big tree needs to be decorated by the professionals. Of course, I'll do whatever you want. However, I do think it'd be a great conversation piece to tell your guests how much the tree means to you and your family. Oh, you mean do it ourselves? Yes! Maybe this Christmas, we could start to act like a family. And... I'll put away my phone. Deal. Tara Aries, you are intuitive and a born mediator. I like it. Keep it up. I think he really likes me! Oh, yes, good, yes. - Everything okay, Carolina? - Yes, dear. I'm just surprised at what I'm hearing in here, laughter. Ooh! Look who's under the mistletoe. Aren't we a bit old for that? Uh-oh. Mm, knew that wouldn't last. They used to be so affectionate. Lately, my son's way of showing affection is just lookin' up from his phone at her. Oh! Look, I found a mistletoe. Oh. They're quite the couple, huh? Yeah, I think we're out of tinsel, I'm gonna go see if there's more in the garage. I need to get back to workin' on your dress. It's not gonna sew itself, so... - Yeah, but it's really... - Yep. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. ♪ Deck the hall with bells of holly ♪ ♪ Falala-la-la-la-la ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ Falala-la-la-la-la ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ Falala la-la... ♪ Hey. What have you done to my staircase? - Is it too much? - Yes. - Which is why I love it! - Okay, good. Okay, good. Because there's more. Carolina, would you do the honors? Sure, okay. - Ooh! - Elliott, you're missing it! - Oh, where's London? - Oh. Her and the designer, they're a doing fitting for her new dress. Although I have a feeling she's checking out his sizes, too. Well, at least London is getting her mind off of that terrible Canyon fellow. - Canyon? - London's ex-boyfriend. They've called their relationship off and on so many times I gave up trying to keep up on their status. Now that's how you do Christmas! Remarkable job. Thank you, so now that most of the decorations are out of the way, I was thinking I could get started on the brunch menu with Sapphire. Ooh, I'm too pooped to think. Why don't you write up your suggestions and then show me in the morning? I want at least a dozen options for each course. - I can do that in my sleep. - Oh. You're so much like your Uncle Calvin. Always going above and beyond what everyone expects. No, no, no, no, no. You go have fun with your family. Do all that Christmas tradition stuff. Enjoy the simple moments you can never get back. Christmas carols. Baking cookies. Playing games. Games? What kinds of games? Uh, all the games that I saw upstairs in the game room. I totally forgot we have that up there. That's a marvelous idea, darling! I thought you were bonkers when you hired someone you just met to move in and plan your party. But I was the one crazy to question your judgment in the first place. Mm-hm. - Nice job. - Thanks. - Oh! - Mm. You look... good in feathers. Well, thank you for lending it to me. - What's this for? - Excuse the cheesy pun. - But spill the tea. - On what? On Tre. I need all the information you have to make him jealous. Him? Uh, I meant them. The world. I want the world to know I've found the man of my dreams. Wow. You must really like him, huh? I need him more than you could imagine. I keep forgetting you two are related. I forget sometimes, too. So what's he really like? Well, he pledged Alpha at Howard. After graduation, he went to FIT... No! Oh, God, no! Not his resume. Who is he? What do you like best about Tre? I love his sense of humor. He can take the most stressful situation and make it fun. Like he finds... Did I say something wrong? It's obvious you adore him. - Lucky for me, he's your cousin. - Right. Otherwise, we'd have some major competition. Oh, believe me, no competition here. I mean, look at you. Rich. Gorgeous. Social Media Influencer. What man wouldn't fall in love with you? You're right. I am quite a catch, aren't I? - Oh! - Ooh... Uh, let me go get the slippers that match your little jammies. I didn't have time to get a pedicure. Don't feel ashamed, vanity is actually a very empowering emotion. I'm not vain, uh, I'm just... undecided on which face lotions to use. That's why I dropped by. London said the good stuff's in here. Yeah, so you and London seem to really be hitting it off. - Huh? - You okay with that? Yeah, why wouldn't I be? I don't know, I thought maybe I sensed a little jealousy when she kissed me. I'm not jealous. Besides, you kissed her back. No, I didn't. Ha! Ooh! You have to come and get it! Come on, Big Ben. London's calling! Oh, yeah, you can't catch me. Ooh, you're fast. You're gonna chase me. So why are you talking to me? Go tell him how you feel right now. Well, unfortunately, this London chick is gaga over him. You know, he might be more gaga over you if he knew how you felt! Oh, okay, okay, this makin' sense now. This whole self inflicted dating drama has nothing to do with your career aspirations. It's because you're afraid he's gonna say "No". Just like you scared to pitch your app. What No! No, that's crazy, look... It's simply about timing, okay, with Tre - and the app - Ok girl, If that helps you sleep. Look, either way you better get on both that app and the one that's getting away. It's almost Christmas Eve, and after that it's gonna be over. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna let Tre know how I feel. Good! Cause you've already risked so much already... for your plans to fall apart. And, uh, that way, I can oversee Bragg's Catering when they show up in the morning. Wait a minute. You're not talking about Michael Bragg? - Mm. - What? I checked. He's completely booked. Well, he was. But I changed his mind. I must say, Tara. You are obviously born to do this. The party isn't for another two days and we're way ahead of schedule. - Tara? Everything okay? - Yeah. A-and I really appreciate the compliment. But I was born to design software. It's not that I don't love party planning. But I just really wanted to make something that brings people together. After all, love, romance, and... and building a family is the lifeblood of civilization. That's what motivated me to make a dating app. You're kidding me. That's what my husband does. Well, the apps, not dating. At least, he better not be. Darling, did you know that Tara creates those cute apps for phones? Yeah, yeah, she told me at the party. Actually, uh, I didn't get to tell you everything. 'Cause we had gotten interrupted... Kobe! I really can't stand playing you. - Tara, you wanna play? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure! And then maybe after we can talk about my dating app? There's... Oh, wait. I gotta take this. Table those thoughts for a minute, okay, Tara? - Okay. Yeah. - Circle back around to it. - Yes. Sure. Of course. - Tre! Take on your cousin. A real player knows when to leave the game. Ah, I'll take on Tara. It's really rare I get any competition. - Let's do it. - All right. Oh! Oh, wow. Oh. Okay. What is your deal? It's just a game, Tara! I'm sorry. - I guess I got carried away. - Mm-hmm. - Mm. - Excuse me. Just a... Tara, what's going on? - I don't know my own strength? - No. I feel like this is about something else. I've been trying all day to think of a good way to say this. And... I guess I'm scared. You don't need to be. Ask for what you want and you'll get it. Okay. Here I go. Tre... You don't have to do it now. You should tell him at the party. Elliott. I know you're upset because he rejected your idea, but the party is the ideal time. He'll be surrounded by all of his investor friends so when you pitch your app, it will look good for both of you. And don't worry. I'll smooth things over with London. You just concentrate on Elliott. Okay. Remember, it's business, not pleasure. Of course. Right. Gotcha. - Oh. Hi. - Uh-huh. You sure you wanna go back out there? Yes, I think I should go apologize to London for being so competitive. She'll get over it. Besides, it'll be good for her. You thirsty? - Not really. I just... - You might be thirsty. Mm-hmm. My grandfather drank a shot of this every day with his oatmeal, and lived to be 99. Mm-hmm. So we're going to... - Oh, that's good. - Ah, ah-ha. Don't tell me. Mm-hmm. All right. - Cheers! Mm-hmm. - Cheers! It's a shame you can't spend Christmas with the rest of your family. I mean, besides Tre. Yeah, well, you know, I don't have much family to spend it with anyway. So... No mom or dad? Well, I haven't seen my dad in ever. And my mom, let's just say we don't get along as well as you and your son do. Elliott and I didn't always get along. Mm, I used to be so critical of him. I warned him he was making all the wrong choices. Obviously, he proved me wrong, which made me even more mad at him. So I stopped talking to him. For five years! Me and my stupid pride. Well, what changed? One day, he invited me for dinner. He just wanted to talk, and I listened. And we learned each other all over again. And today, he's not just my son. He's my best friend. That's nice, but I don't think my mother and I will ever have a relationship like that. Mm. Take it from someone who learned the hard way, anger is a very overrated emotion. And you only get one family in this lifetime. Besides, I heard why you created your dating app. And I admire someone that values relationships and love. Which is why I don't think you wanna shut your mom out of your life forever. Maybe I don't, but shouldn't she be making the first move? Wait. I guess she did. Mm-hmm. You don't have to forgive your mom. Just listen. Give her a chance. There's nothing to fear. After all, you were brave enough to sneak in here and win favor with not just my son, his wife, too. And Sapphire don't like anybody. Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me. I've pulled a few fast ones in my day, too. - Oh, I don't need another shot. - Look, girl this is... Uh-huh. - Look, girl. Uh-huh. - Yes, ma'am Just call her. Just call her. Just call her. Okay. Hello? Um, mom? - Tara? - Hey. - Am I, am I bothering you? - You're not a bother, Tara. You never were, baby. Look, uh... I just wanted to say that, uh... I... I know that... Tara? Hello, are you there? I don't think I'm ready for this. - I'm sorry. - Wait, Tara... - Tara. - Hey. Come in. So I got good news and bad news. The bad news is London wants me to make her a new dress. She wants something more provocative. But the good news is, she wanted to offer this to you. What's wrong? You don't like it? No, no, it's stunning. I'm just, just kinda over myself at the moment. So it's gonna be that kind of night. What kind of night? - A "Come to Jesus" night. - Oh, my God. Appropriate since it's almost Christmas. - Talk to me. - Thanks. I always thought my mom was the villain 'cause she was never there for me. And now that she wants to be back in my life... Isn't that a good thing? I spent years pushing her away and protecting my heart. And I just don't know if I will ever be ready to let her in, even though, rationally, I know I should. Don't rush into reconciling a relationship you're not ready for. Yeah, but will I ever be ready? Well, why do I always overthink everything? You're just keeping your options open. My mother comes back to town practically on her hands and knees begging me for another chance, and I hang up the phone. I feel so lame. So lame that the first time you went to the club you wore church clothes? That was me. Well, sure, you looked cute. To my grandma's friends, maybe. I had no fashion sense back then. You know what, I think I can beat that. Yeah. My Aunt Rhonda told me the 80's were back and convinced me to wear stirrup pants to school. So I walk in all confidently, and I get detention because the principal said I looked like a prostitute. Yeah. Go ahead. Get it off. Yeah, I know. I won. - You did. - I won. Look, as for your mom... give her a chance. I would hate for her to not witness the amazing woman you've turned out to be. To you. To us. I'm like, oh, you don't get anymore. Okay, wait, so you're telling me your first kiss was with a girl named Mildred? What, what was she, 80? It was a family name. You? His name was Sylvester. - Wait, he was black? - Yeah. And I thought he was so hot. He looked like, like a young Carlton. - From the Fresh Prince? - Mm-hmm. The original or the reboot version? Original Carlton all the way. I was wrong, You are lamer than me. I'm just being honest. I am, too! In fact, I've never been this honest with in my entire life. Most girls aren't impressed by the guy who spends more time in the sewing room than at the gym or the club. Well, then, I guess I'm not most girls. No, you're not. It's getting late. Maybe we should both get some rest. The party is in two days, and we still have to... Whoa. Everything's spinning. Ah, just stay here until it stops. You're good. Thanks. For what? For everything. Crashing the party. Bringing me along. I haven't had this much fun or been this relaxed with someone in... well, ever. Mm. - Tre? - Mm. Remember when I said I didn't believe in love at first sight? Well... I didn't believe in love at first sight. Until I met you. That sounded so corny. Huh. Tre? Tre? Tre? Tre? What? I think you should wake up. Oh, my God! Ah, di-di-did we... Ah, of course not! Because we, we still have our clothes on. Tara, you don't have to take your clothes off to... Tara? Is Tre in there with you? I can't find him. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Ah, no. No Tre in here. Are you sure? I've been looking everywhere. I can't find him. What? Tell her I needed more fabric. Tre went out to see a mechanic. What? Why would he need to see a mechanic? Did I say mechanic? Did I say mechanic? No, what I meant to say was, he's, uh, he's, he's... Fabric. Tre went to get more fabric. Yeah, tons and tons of fabric. He was just like, "I need fabric." It's fine. If you speak to Tre, remind him, the party's in 24 hours! Consider it done. Ugh. You can come out now. Oh, my gosh. - A mechanic? Really? - Yes. Yeah. I turn into such a blubbering idiot. This is just one of the many reasons that it is pointless for me to pitch my app to Elliott. I just don't get you at times. You can be so bold and confident, and then this. Yeah, I can crash a party, create an app, do almost anything, but I turn into an idiot when it comes to pitching my work. With that attitude, you will. - Gee, thanks for the pep talk. - Sorry. I'm just saying, if you go into a situation already defeated, then, yeah, it won't work out. You have to sell you on you, before anybody else. - Pitch me. Right now. - Not right now. - I have too much to do. - Tara... What makes my app different from the rest is that, instead of giving you an endless parade of choices, it searches the entire globe to find your one true love. It's like having a personal relationship with Cupid. - See? How easy was that? - Yeah, that was good. But it was only easy to talk to you because I have nothing to lose. You're not some mega-wealthy tech investor who can make all my dreams come true. So when you pitch Elliott, just pretend that he's me. Super easy. Wait, Tre. One more thing. What is it? Oh, it as just London sending over dresses to inspire me. That girl definitely leaves nothing to the imagination. But I do appreciate her pushing me. Wasn't that a nice of way saying she is demanding? She can be, but she's also extremely funny and honest about who she is and what she wants. You know, the more I get to know her, the more I, I genuinely like her. Anyway, what were you saying? Um, nothing. Just good luck with her dress. Because I know she's gonna love it. Okay, so everybody emailed their RSVP's. They'll be coming in through that door. Ooh. This is sweet. The valet is right there, so it should be little less... You take their jackets and put it in the, um, in that closet right over there. Because that way it won't be too much. Oh, my... Oh, my God, it fell. You gotta put it on my neck. - Here, let me help you. - Oh. Oh. I see. You don't really like me, do you? What's not to like? You're rude, spoiled, self-centered... But in a stylish, girl-boss kinda way! If this is about the air hockey game, then I really do apologize again. Forgiven and forgotten. Most women don't like me, but I admire your honesty. Which is why I'm surprised I don't remember you from St. Tropez. There was a lot going on. Well, regardless, I'm really glad you're here. I usually bail on my family at Christmas. But for the first time, I'm actually having more fun here at home. I mean, you made something as simple as decorating for Christmas or playing games actually enjoyable. And I owe that to you. You don't owe me anything. And don't worry. I'll make sure he won't get hurt. Tre. I could see how protective you are of him. I mean, it's obvious you two love each other. And he talks about you constantly. He cares a lot about you. Oddly enough, I may have found a friend in you. Mm. I might need to lay off the eggnog. Yeah. Maybe. Well, it's getting late. I still have to do my cold packs and my face creams. Have to look my absolute best at this party tomorrow. Did London say something to upset you? No. But I always thought she was just a rich and vapid snob. In fact, none of them are. The Everests are a, a real, true family who love each other and... and I shouldn't be here. - Tara. - What? We know why we're here. I snuck into these people's lives just to take advantage of them. - I'm just as guilty as you are. - No, you're not. At least your intentions will come across as pure now that you're falling for London. I'm not falling for London. Yes, she's becoming a good friend. But I can't imagine her ever being anything more than that. Why not? She's rich, gorgeous, influential, pushing you creatively. What? Tara... Oh, shoot! That's the caterer. I have to take this. Excuse me. Hello? Y-yeah, no, this isn't a bad time. Okay, even if somebody has a peanut allergy they could still have peanut butter, right? It's different. Or maybe not. I don't know. Ugh. So you're gonna be the cook now, too? Yeah, the call I got earlier was from the caterer. And he thought it was a good idea to go skiing and broke both of his legs. - Ouch. - Mm. And w-what are you gonna do? Do about what? Oh, my, food is everywhere. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. It's just a minor hiccup. Mr. Bragg had an unfortunate accident and he can no longer make it. But, but don't freak out. I have all the ingredients, the instructions, we're good to go. We're gonna have to cancel the party. What? No, no! Trust me, I got this. Well, you know, it's really late, so you should probably go upstairs and, and get some rest, so you could be gorgeous tomorrow. I'm all nerves. I can't sleep. Well, I'm sure your husband can help find a way to relax you. Isn't that one of the perks of marriage? Well, perhaps I can see if Elliott would like a, a little late night snack. Snack? I was just thinkin' of giving you a sna.. We're, we're here. Excuse me. How about a... champagne... and strawberries? That's romantic. Oh-ho, darling, you're the best. Have fun. Tara, I appreciate your ambition, but there's no way you can do this alone. Let me help. No, no, you still have to finish London's dress. So just get ou... But there's no way you could cook a gourmet brunch for 20 people. Twenty is nothing! For my aunt's birthday, do you know we fed over 100? And you cooked for all 100? Yeah. Kinda. A little. She did all the cooking. But-but don't freak out. I watched and learned. Besides, brunch is just a fancy version of bacon and eggs. So how hard can this be? I don't think it's supposed to look like this. Mm, shouldn't you be sewing something fabulous for London? Ah, about the catering... I told you, I have the brunch under control. I've already started cooking the Cornish hens, I just have to roll out the cinnamon buns. I'm fine! Speaking of, they're probably ready. Mm, here we come. Why is it still raw? Because you probably turned on the broiler instead of the oven. Don't be mad at him. He knew you needed the help. That's what family is for. Which is also why I also called in for some more backup. You wouldn't. You didn't. She did. So, where do you want me to start, pastries or potatoes first? You know, Tara, cooking like this reminds me, when you were five... Shh, shh, shh! Diahann, I'm concentrating. Did you just call me Diahann? I can't exactly call you mom. What would the Everest's think if they knew my mom and aunt came in to save my butt? Oh, that you're being honest? If anyone asks, you two are catering professionals that I hired at the last minute. Okay? I'm just glad you're calling me anything. This doesn't mean I'm not still mad at you. Let's just keep this professional. Okay? I will pay you both for your time and services. We don't want your money. Oh, no, no, no, you speak for yourself! No. But don't worry, tomorrow, I can go back to being the absolute worst mother in the world. I never said you were the absolute worst mother in the world. Here, taste this. It's a sauce for the Panettone French Toast Casserole. Yes, that will do. Careful. You might start to love her. Stop. Don't move. What's wrong? Is it my hair? I have something in my teeth? You look simply radiant. Oh. Mm, thank you, darling. Tara reminded me to appreciate the simple moments I never get back. I'mma start by dialing back on my work. I adore you, Sapphy. Even more than when we first met. - Oh. - Mm. You know, last night felt like the first time in years that we truly connected. I think we've been denying ourselves the perks of marriage far too long. Mm, Tara reminded me of that. Well, I'm gonna have to add that to the list of things to thank her for. Oh. Wait, do we put out the muff... Okay, muffins are there. Pass the bread over here. No, leave the bread right there, please. - Oh! Good morning. - Oh, my... Well, it certainly is! Tell me you didn't do all of this while we were sleeping? I had some help. Mr. and Mrs. Everest, I, I would like for you to meet, um... This is... Diahann and Rhonda. Such an honor. Yes, we're the secret weapon Ms. Aries calls out when she wants to make an exceptionally good impression. On a scale of one to ten, I say you ladies scored ten million. - Thank you. - Thank you. Tara's one of the most gifted and talented young women I've ever known. I'm just glad we were able to to work together before some big tech company steals her away with all those amazing phone apps she makes. Tara, I keep forgetting that you have a secret life as a computer software engineer. We have to do something about that. Sure. In fact... In fact, I need to make sure that the cranberry mimosa bar is stocked. So, I'm gonna go do that. I can do that. Why don't you get changed and enjoy the party? The party planner doesn't exactly get to enjoy the actual party. Well, now she does. You've done so much work around the house this week, Tara. Please. Come socialize with us. Mm? Thank you. We don't need you. You go have yourself a good time. Boss. - Thank you. - Yeah. You have no idea how much meeting you has changed my life. You've changed mine, too. I already have five women who want me to make them custom gowns. I don't know how I can ever thank you. Let's take a good pic. If this doesn't get his attention, nothing will. Pardon me? Oh, my! Wow. - Girl! - You like it? Oh, my God. - So, am I, am I wearing it well? - I'll say! Honey, you are wearing that dress better than I did. Thank you. Oh, I really hope this budding friendship is genuine. I need someone as honest and as bold as you in my life who doesn't take any of my crap. - Yeah. - Merry Christmas, beautiful. Merry Christmas. Oh, Tara, you are amazing! It does my heart wonders to see so many of my friends grit their teeth with compliments. - Gotcha. - Yes, Tara. You designed the perfect party. But parties aren't the only thing she designs. Tara never finished telling you about her dating app. And since she now has your undivided attention... It's that time, huh. - I guess so. - Come with me. Everyone, gather around please. This is Tara Aries. And not only did she put together this extravagant affair, but she has a dating app that she wants to share as well. You know what's so great about a Christmas tree? It never goes out of style. And neither does dating. It will always be a strong, reliable investment. MY1MATCH is one of one. We use the latest technology, based on predictive analysis and trends in your mental and physical state. Okay, to be clear, our technology scans public domain data and social media outlets to find compatible matches. It's kinda like having a personal relationship with Cupid. So you're trying to tell me that this app can show me my one true love? I'm not trying to tell you. With Carolina's help, I entered Elliott's necessary information and made the details as accurate as possible. Now let's see if he has a match. W-wait! What if I don't show up on that app for him? Oh, my. Well... I'm so sorry. But, uh, it seems like the two of you are stuck with each other for life. Ohh. God. Okay, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Tara, I'll be in touch. Yes, sir. Tara, you truly are a Christmas miracle. It's as if you're too good to be true. She is. - Can you believe that? - It all worked out. - Did you see it? Did you see it? - Just like you said it would. It did, didn't it? Oh, it's so sweet to see you two cousins sharing so much love and joy during Christmas time. If only Calvin was here to see it. Here to see what? Oh, look! It's your Uncle Calvin! Uh-oh. It looks like the gingerbread is about to hit the fan. Smile. Calvin! You're back from Rio! As much as I love lying on the beach drinking Caipirinhas, missing the event of the year wasn't an option. So I cut the trip short. - You look stunning. - Ohh... This party is beyond epic. That's because we had your wonderful niece who saved the day. - Niece? - And nephew. He designed London's dress. They practically saved Christmas. How touching, but I don't have a niece or a nephew. What? I told you, we barely know each other. Tara, what's going on? Okay, we don't know each other. I mean, I know of Mr. Aries. I guess I haven't been completely honest. Did you lie your way into my family just so you could sell me something? Yes, I did. I knew I didn't know you from St. Tropez. Who are you people? For starters, we're not cousins. I'm an app designer and I've been crashing corporate parties just trying to get a break. And I thought that if I could make you something so memorable it could help legitimize my fashion career. And that's my mother and my aunt that came to help me make the food when the caterer cancelled. - Hey. - Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Everest, please believe me when I say... I think you have said more than enough. Please just... pack your things. I'm really sorry, okay? Tre, don't go. - I forgive you. - Thank you. But if you all are asking Tara to go, I'm going, too. Ah, ah, ah, whoa. No! I still need you. Come with me. - Say it. - Say what? How disappointed you are in me. I'm not. So it's worse? You're ashamed of me? You think I'm dumb? Because I do. I just made a fool out of myself in front of one of the most powerful families in Atlanta. I think you are very brave. You're not afraid to hustle and break the rules to get what you deserve. And I'm so proud that you are my daughter. That's the worst thing you can tell me! Why? Because now it means I can't hate you anymore! We-we're not gonna be like the Kardashians, like sharing clothes and go into the cosmetics industry, okay? Of course not. And we still have a lot to work on. But you've met me half-way. So I'm willing to start over if you are. Deal? Deal. Absolutely. Deal, deal, deal! I always knew why you couldn't spend much time with me as a child. It wasn't because you didn't love me. You just wanted to provide me a better life. I just wanted to make enough to give you all the things I didn't have as a little girl. But all I ever needed was you. You know, the Everest's taught me that. While money is nice, love is the more important. And, uh... I love you, mom. I always have. Tre, no, please. Tre! Please, stay for just five more minutes. - What? Why? - Because... London. - Kiss me. - Are you crazy? Kiss me and I'll get you a pop-up store on Rodeo Drive in six months. Oh, Canyon! Oh, my God. What are you doing here? You and me are going to Vegas. Baby, we're getting married tonight. I can't marry you. - I'm in love with another man. - We're just friends. Oh, no, wait. Canyon, wait. I only just, just wanted you to see how much you'd miss me if I, if I run off with another man. You mean to tell me, you manipulated my feelings just so I would fall back in love with you? Baby, that is so hot! Oh, my God, baby, you're hot. - Do you have a ring? - Yeah, I do. I'm-I'm-I'm, I just, I'm sorry. Just one-one minute. One... Go grab a quick bite to eat and I'll-I'll be right there. So this entire time, you just used me to get your boyfriend back? Just as you used me to get everyone to see your designs. - Touche. - Touche. But I wasn't kidding about the pop-up store. You're exceptional, Tre. And I wanna invest in you. No hard feelings? We even? Even-Steven. Even-Steven. Come on, Tre. My mom will drive us home. Do you really have to go? Yeah. Your mom just... Oh, my mother is always making something out of nothing. She will get over this. Trust. You actually want me to stay? Of course I do! You were able to do a snow job on all of us with such style, class, and sincerity. I'm in complete awe of you. Um, thanks, I guess. And I'm taking you to St. Tropez this summer. What? I know I can learn a thing or two from you. I would love that. Excuse me, but I think you all fail to realize that we have all been grifted here. - Listen here. - Nuh-unh. Girl, hold my earrings. Mom. Aunt Rhonda. I made my own bed. You know, I was growing to really like you. But now that I've seen your true colors... Oh, Sapphire! Shut up! Mrs. Everest, I respectfully ask for you to stay out of this. And I respectfully ask for you to pull your head out of your butt. Didn't you get the party you wanted? A party that this woman worked night and day on? Now you wanna kick her out. Well, I could've had her arrested. You could have. And you could be having a miserable Christmas. But-but for whoever this young woman was pretending to be, was authentically here for all of us. And, Elliott... Didn't she help you both realize how much you are truly meant for one another? And on top of that, didn't she just hand you an invention that's gonna earn you millions? - Well... - Well? Thank you for standing up for me. But I've caused your family enough trouble. And besides, I have my own family to go home to. And for once, I'm actually excited about it. I told you, baby. Just listen. The rest will take care of itself. I'll never forget you. I won't forget you either, sugar. Wait. Mother's right. If anything, we owe you. Please stay. As our guests. As my friends. Friends and business partners? I forgot what it was like to put it all on the line for a chance to make your dreams come true. Thank you for reminding me, mother. In your ever-so-eloquent way. That's what I'm here for, baby. - Mrs. Everest... - No, no. You may have come here under false pretense, but you have certainly given more than you received. I appreciate all that you have done our my family. And I'm sorry I got so angry. I'm the one that should apologize. - Oh. Yes. - I'm sorry. Now, before we rejoin the party, let's all have a celebratory drink in the living room. Yes! That sounds good. Yes! Wait, Tre! Um, come here a minute. Did that really just happen? - It really did. - Oh, my God. So about you and London. There's only been one woman I've had my eyes on this entire time. A woman who made me realize how fun it is to chase my dreams. A woman who refuses to settle for anything less than the absolute best. I just hope I can meet her expectations. You can't. Because you're better than anything I could've ever imagined. Um, you got something on your lip. What? I've been wanting to do that ever since you spilled coffee on my jacket outside the party. And I wanted to do that ever since you were impressed by me sneaking past security talking about women's underwear. But hold up. Didn't you say a person had to be crazy to believe in love at first sight? I did, but now I know you'd have to be even crazier not to believe in it. You know, we all waiting for y'all. Both, both of y'all. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on. A toast, to new friends. To budding careers. But most of all, to Christmas! To Christmas! So Christmas dinner at my place tomorrow? - I would love that. - Sure. You too. I'll be there. Mm.
