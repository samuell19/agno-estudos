Worshipping God can help us get heaven, but not win the election. Go to the public and spread our message. The way God is appeased with hymns appease the public with speeches. lf they don't listen, give them liquor and money then you'll see that we'll win the election grandly. Mr. Kishanchand, no matter what we do but we can win the seat of ward 1 1 at Hanuman lane. 'No' word is only in fools' dictionary, Bhakti Prasad. Dad, he's right. That area is Swaraj Party's stronghold. People of that place will vote for that party. Son Teja, if politics of greed don't work use the plot of terror. Sangram. -Yes? Spread so much terror in that area so that people should feel scared even to mention Swaraj Party's name and feel they would die if they vote for that Party. On the election day be in that area like angels of death. -l got it? Hail Sewakram! Hail Sewakram! Hail Sewakram! Hail Sewakram! Quiet! Quiet! Run! Get out! Don't kill me. Leave me. lnspector, do you know whom you hit? l'm Kishanchand's ace man. You're not an ace man, but crooked man used to do dirty work. How dare you!

Son, you've done us a favor by coming at the right time. lt's my duty to protect the law. You've protected not just the law, but common people too. lf every office is dutiful like you instead of hooliganism, democracy will prevail.

And your son is wise. lf my son says so, your son will surely lose. Strange! You just need an excuse to fight. l didn't criticize your son. l just called him a fool. lsn't that criticism? -No. l'm a fool. Entire world is fool. You too are a fool. -What did you say? l'm a fool. Fighting again! My elder son is clever. My younger son is clever! Don't fight on this topic. l've told you often. -Yes. After court's verdict we'll find out who wins and who loses. Right? -Right. ls it right? -Yes. Why didn't the defense lawyer come in the court? Your honor, he wouldn't have point to fight the case so how could he appear in the court? l'm here, your honor. Defense lawyer is here. l apologize for coming late, judge. Actually today l'm facing such a big lawyer so l went to temple of Goddess Durga for blessing. Would you like to have offering, Mr. PP? Offerings can't be brought in the court, judge. Sorry, your honor. This court is the temple of justice. And offering can be brought anywhere. Won't you like to defend this case? -Sure, your honor. l will neither present evidence nor witness in front of you. l just want to know if Mr. PP knows at which place liquor shop shouldn't be made. l know. Liquor shop shouldn't be near any religious temples and schools. Ok. Ok. Now tell me, legally how far the liquor shop should be from all these places? 100 meters. -Correct. Note this point, your honor. Now tell me, the liquor shop, whose case is going on how far is it from the temple? What? There is no temple around. What are you saying, Mr. PP? Temple of Goddess Durga is within 100 meters from that shop. This is a lie, your honor. Defense lawyer wants to turn this case around using religion. l went to that liquor shop this morning. Your honor, people go to temple in the morning. But our PP goes to liquor shop. Maybe in intoxicated state he didn't see the temple. He's insulting me, your honor. l repeat there is no temple nearby. -There is a temple. l've come after praying in that temple. Look at the vermillion from the temple. And this flower is offering of the temple. This is wrong. Lie. There is no temple nearby. You can go and see if there is a temple or not. Truth will come out and court can easily give verdict. Ok. l'll go and check myself. Come, judge. This is the liquor shop. -Yes. And that's the temple. When was this temple made? -Long ago. Then why didn't l see it? Dealers of liquor can't see the temple. Measure the distance of the liquor shop from the temple. Come, sir. Let's worship the Goddess. Sir, the liquor shop is 99.5 meters away from the temple. Meaning, within the distance of 100 meters which is objectionable. Sir, it could be a mistake. Measure it again. When you won the election with 5 votes you didn't say it could be a mistake. Recounting should be done. Court orders Mr. Bhakti Prasad to move his liquor shop within 12 hours or it'll be demolished. Brother. -What? This flower if Goddess' offering. Maybe this will help you win the next case. Come. -Ok. Hello, Sharda. How are you? Fine. How are you? l'm fine too. Tell me, what's the day today? You forget. Today is your birthday.

Sit down. l knew my daughter would bring you home because these days girls bring gold medal home. Boys don't even get wooden medal. Look at the horoscope quickly. What's their sun sign? My daughter is Virgo. And he's Leo. How did you know my sun sign? Sun sign? l know even horoscopes of all the cops. Wow! There alliance will be very good. Really! Great. lt's ringing too. l mean it's a good sign. -Yes. lt's auspicious. Hello, this is Teliram. That inspector is there. -Yes. Will the work be done? -Yes. Don't worry. Preist. -Yes. -Look at the horoscope again. Their alliance won't be good. There is some problem. But everything was fine a while ago. There stars were not intruding. Not everything is in mess. Priya, l'll leave. Ok? Bye. -Ok. lnspector, it's for you. For me? -Yes, for you. Hear what the problem is. Hello, inspector Sunil here. Teja was kidnapped by goons. -What? Fantastic! Fantastic! lnspector, this auspicious work was done at auspicious time. Between 9.15 and 9.30. decieved me. But your son will never escape from me. Stop, inspector! You're a really big fool. My son must be already on the plane to Singapore. And it will take off in 5 minutes. My son Teja will leave this country for good. Are you feeling dizzy? lt happens. When stars unfavour you, there's no way out. -Yes. Hello, can l speak to the airport manager, please! Airport manager speaking! Look, the plane to Singapore has a bomb in it. -What? Yes. -Who are you? The mayor of this city. Okay, smart guys. What are you waiting for? Catch him. Don't let him reach the airport. Go! Air lndia is sorry to announce that flight number Al 105 will leave for Singapore 2 hours late. Air lndia flight no Al 105 is ready for take off to Singapore. Passengers please proceed to immigration and customs. Mr. Teja! The arms of the police are quicker than the mayor's mind! Come on! Based on the statements of the witnesses and evidences the court concludes that the accused Teja not only tried to molest Sushila but also caused the circumstances that forced her to commit suicide. Therefore this court finds the accused Teja guilty for Sushila's death and sentences him to life imprisonment. lt has also been proved that in spite of being the mayor, Kishanchand misused his position and power to protect a criminal. lf a guardian of the law himself breaks the law he has no right to retain his position. Therefore this court orders Mr. Kishanchand to be removed from the post of mayor. Very good. You can recite verses from the Bhagwad Gita, too. Of course. You thought you were the only learned scholar here? Father, your tea. -Keep it here. Listen! -Yes. What do you think of Sharda as our daughter-in-law? Not a bad idea. l understand now. You can rest the entire day. And she'd do all your chores. And she'd serve you all the time. You want such a daughter-in-law, right? lt's not that. She's an ideal woman. l want her because she's perfect for our family. That's true. Hear, hear! What are you doing? New girl, come out. Everybody, please gather at the hall! What's the matter, dear? -Sit down. C'mon. Jyoti, Why are you shouting? -You too sit down. Please Yes, okay. ls everyone here? -child, why are you shouting? Oh, grandpa, l have to resolve an important family matter. You'll solve? -Yes, that's why l've called everyone. Listen, brother, both you and the new girl are single. So we elders want to get you two married and fulfill our responsibility. Jyoti, what are you saying? She's right, child. Children are the image of God. So she proclaimed what we were thinking. Sunil, what do you have to say? -Father, What would make me happier than to have such a decent and cultured girl as my sister-in-law? Ravi, what do you have to say? -Look, mother. l brought Sharda here, so that she would have a place to live. But if you wish that this to be her husband's house then l consent, but only if she does too. Tell us, Sharda. l must have done good deeds in my previous lives to get a chance to marry into such a family. Get the invitation cards printed immediately. ln the name of God Almighty the two of them will be married at an auspicious astrological moment. This is the decision of the elders of this house. This girl is great! What? The lawyer is going to marry that girl? -Yes, sir. And this is the time to attack. And the weapon is Jankidas. -Jankidas? You mean that Jankidas? -Yes, that same. But the problem is that he's in jail right now. When l decide to attack my enemy l can even make the sun rise from the west! You all are laughing? Hurry up! Everyone's waiting for the bride! Greetings. -Welcome, Mr. Kishanchand. Congratulations, Mr. Dinanath. Thank you for inviting me to the wedding. l thought you wouldn't invite me this time. Mr. Kishanchand our differences have nothing to do with this wedding. l thought you yourself would refuse to come. -How could l? Please come. l'm really obliged. -Yes. Stop! This wedding can't take place. This wedding can't take place. This wedding can't take place. Shut up! Who are you to stop this wedding? l'm l'm her husband! -Shut up. l'll kill you if you speak rubbish. The wrongdoer himself is threatening me! As soon as l went to jail, you trapped my wife. And made your mistress? You rascal! -One who tries to marry somebody else's wife is called rascal. Rascal?! Get out or else l'll kill you! Sunil, control yourself! Do you see this injustice? These people are threatening to kill me! But if they do that she'll be called a widow and not spinster. Because, l am her husband! l plead with all of you. Please get me justice! Please bring my wife back to me! -Silence! l've listened to your nonsense for too long! How dare you create a racket here? Who gave you the right to come here? That marital chain that l put around her neck did! That fire did, which was a witness to the 7 sacred rounds l took with her! That vermilion did, which l applied on her forehead! But ask her. Even if l'm in shackles right now who gave her the right to marry someone else? Ask her, who has given her that right! Ask her. What proof do you have that you're telling the truth? Proof? l've proof. These photos! Look! You too! Look, you too have a look. Let everyone see them! Child, what's all this? Sharda?! Did you see? Did you see? Her running away is a bigger proof than these photos! And he's like a pimp giving refuge to runaway girls! Shut up! Do you know who you're pointing your finger at? Law and justice are alive in this city only because of him! Mr. Dinanath, why are you silent? Why don't you say that all this is a lie? lt's rubbish. l got it. Your silence implicates you too were involved in the vile deed that would have occurred here today! How shameful! You said your two sons are the two eyes of law. Now we know that their eyes lust for other men's wives! Shut up. Hold your tongue or You can silence me but what will you do when the entire city will spit on your father's name? How many mouths will you silence? Everyone will say that it's not the temple but a brothel where law and justice are raped. Enough, Kishanchand! Don't pour salt on their wounds! Mr. Dinanath, l am certain that you would never deliberately do anything wrong. Please say something. Father! -What happened? What happened to him? What happened? No! Grocer! -Yes. How much are the onions? -3 rupees, sir. Look at me and answer! How much are the potatoes? 3 rupees, sir. -Look at me! What about the aubergine? What are you doing? -Sorry, sir. Why should l look at you? Take whatever you wish. That's like a good boy. Then give me 2 kilos each of onions Okay! -potatoes, and aubergine. Here's Rs.5. Constable! -Who is it? Be careful, you'll start to stoop! Did you fill your bags for free? -Speak softly! Let's do something. Come to that corner. A constable, doing that? You do it to the public; can't l do it to you? Come on! What is it? -Take out Rs200. Did your father give me Rs200? He told me to take it from you. -Why? Didn't you get your pay today? -l did. So where's my pay? What? l'll throw you in jail! You will? -Yes! Then l'll tell the inside story. -What? Recall that frightening night of December 7. What happened that day? -A murder in prison! -Shut up. Put it in my mouth! -Here, gobble it! Keep the bags. l'll take them. Let me take the vegetables. -l'll take them too. Vegetables too! -Yes. -Yucks! -Are they spoilt? Listen. What's your salary? -Rs1 ,200. -Do something. Give me 50 percent of it, every month at the National park. Why? -Murder! l will. -Listen, there's more. Give me 50 percent of your illegal wages too near the Bijlee talkies. Why? -Otherwise, murder. Listen. Give me 2 tickets everyday for the films shown there. -So shameless! Who? -Me. He's the first thief to extort money from a policeman. Listen! -No. Hey. Grandma. Grandma. Please have your food. Look, Grandma. l haven't eaten anything either. lf you won't eat, l won't either! Mother, come and have your food. Look, until you eat, this child will stay hungry too. And it's a sin to keep a child hungry. There's no difference between sin and salvation here anymore. Father was proud of this house being a temple of truth and integrity. But you turned it into his grave! Sunil! What are you talking about? He's telling the truth, Ravi! Mother, if you would listen to Sharda's story just once What is left to say that we haven't heard? That day you said that she lost her case because of your mistake and was helpless. l admit l lied that day, but So how can we believe that you'll tell the truth today? Will you tell the truth now after turning mother into a widow and destroying this house? Brother, you behaved like a lawyer even in this house. You can never tell the truth. You're a liar, a hypocrite! -Sunil. Mr. Ravi. Mr. Ravi! l saw Sharda in the street! l tried to stop her, but she went away crying! What? Stop, Ravi! lf you try to bring back Sharda under any pretext it will be my corpse leaving the house this time! Sharda! Sharda! Sharda, stop! Sharda! Sharda! Sharda! What are you doing? Leave me. Let me die! What's this nonsense? Leave me alone. An unfortunate like me has no right to live. Your cheerful house became silent because of me. Your father died because of me. Don't say such things, Sharda. No, l'm a curse in the form of a woman! l'm a stain. l've started to loathe myself. Let me die. No, l won't let you die. How can you decide whether you have the right to live? You forgot the man willing to fight the whole world for you? Oh, you forgot me because we couldn't get married. So l don't have any right over you. But l will grab all my rights today. Come with me. What happened? Where's Jyoti? Why don't you speak up? Didn't you find Jyoti? l could have found her only if she was missing. Meaning? Ravi has settled down with Sharda at Nehru Nagar. What? He took Jyoti there from the school. He took away my child? My child? Who's he to take away my Jyoti? l admit l didn't give birth to her. But l've brought her up right from birth. l have every right over her. Go and bring her right now. Go. Mom, listen to me. Brother brought her from an orphanage. So he has the right to take her away. But l can't live without Jyoti, Sunil. l can't live. l won't be at peace if l can't hear her sweet voice. l can't live without her. l can't. -Mother. Mother l know you can forget your own son but not your adopted daughter. Calm now. The court summons Ratanlal, alias Surajmal! Go! Go inside. -C'mon. Constable. -What is it? -When will l be called? When will the judge summon me? You're a professional, but behave like a queen? The judge has many other cases. lt could take 3-4 hours. 3-4 hours? -Yes, of course. A lot could happen in that time. Come on! Come on! Madam! Madam! Excuse me. Remove my handcuffs. Otherwise, l'll be in trouble. Hurry up. What is it? You? But you were dead! Constable, you?! Remove them or l'll throw you in jail. C'mon. Come, Mr. Teja. -What is it? We're appealing to the high court. Please sign here. Will l evade punishment? -Sure. But why didn't daddy come? He's busy finding witnesses and evidences for you. What are you saying, sir? l'll transfer my mill worth 80 lakhs in your daughter's name. l have a fruit orchard in Simla. l'll transfer it to your name. l hope you're not joking. No, l'm absolutely serious. Advocate. -Yes, Mr. Dhaniram. The documents are ready, too. Look at this. All this will materialize only after Teja is released from jail. For that your daughter will have to sign on this paper. What's written on it? -lt's written here that Priya doesn't consider Teja to be Sushila's murderer. She'll have to give that statement in the court, too. After that will you sign those property documents? That's nothing. l'll get your daughter married to my son. Then she'll be entitled to my property worth millions. Then l'll run and get her signature. Meanwhile you stay serious like this. Priya! Priya! Priya! -l'm here, daddy. -What are you doing here? Come on, get up. Go to the market and buy everything you can clothes, jewelries and many more. What are you doing here? Get lost! Child, just sign on this. What's that paper for? lt's your statement that Teja didn't kill Sushila. The mayor wants to appeal to the high court so that his son can be released on the basis of this statement. Soon after that you two will be married. How could you think that l'd marry Sushila's murderer? What difference does Sushila's death make? And one must overlook a millionaire's small mistakes. You can overlook. Because wealth has blinded you! That's why you want to give away your daughter to Sushila's killer! You know that l love Sunil. Yet, you want to sell me for money? No. l'll never let that happen. Okay. So, Kishanchand has lured your daddy. You refused and came here, but he won't keep quiet. He'll go to any extent with you to get his son released. We have to be very alert now. There's only one way to escape him. -What? l won't go back home. All right. -l am a trickster! Well done, Waghmare! Good loving sir! l'm sorry, good morning, sir! What's all this, Waghmare? Food for the stomach. You could have got it from a hotel. -What are you saying? You brought your guest to my house. Would l serve her hotel food? Never! Now l'll cook for both of you. Why are you taking trouble? l'll cook our food. No, l will. -Sir, l'll cook. l will. -l'll cook. -Sir, l'll cook. l'll cook. -No, l'll cook. -l'll cook. l'll cook. Okay, both of you cook. l'm going. About turn! Quick march! Left, right! Left, right! lt's pouring outside. Our bodies are on fire. lt's pouring outside. Our bodies are on fire. Only this fire can quench this thirst. lt's pouring outside. Our bodies are on fire. Only this fire can quench this thirst. lt's pouring outside. Our bodies are on fire. A drop larger than the ocean. A drop larger than the ocean fell on me in the rain. lt fell on me in the rain. My heart is sinking in that drop. lt's pouring outside. Our bodies are on fire. We were apart. We were apart. There was a barrier between us. l wonder when we were united and the barrier was destroyed. lt's pouring outside. Our bodies are on fire. Now we cannot part. Now we cannot part. nor can we come close to each other. Now we're confused what do we do? Only this fire can quench Only this fire can quench this thirst. lt's pouring outside. -lt's pouring outside. Our bodies are on fire. -Our bodies are on fire. Hello. -Grandma, Jyoti here. Jyoti! Jyoti! My child, how are you? -l am fine. l hope you are fine, grandma. -How can l be fine without you? Why did you leave me and go? l did not come by myself. Your elder son brought me here. Grandma, l want to meet you. But l'm helpless. That's okay, Pinky. But have you done your homework? Homework? What are you saying? You idiot! You are so dumb. Do l have to explain everything? Can't you guess? Oh, is she standing there? All right, call up at this time tomorrow. Please, don't hit me. Don't hit me. l called grandma because she must be missing me. Jyoti. Jyoti. l am responsible for this. l am responsible for this. Sir! Jankidas, how are you? -Wonderful l was waiting for you. Here's your money. -What for, sir? This is your reward for creating a scene on the wedding day. -Oh. Thank you, sir. You have to stir up more trouble in that house. Tell me, sir. Priya has refused to change her statement. And that rascal Sunil has her hidden somewhere. Consider that like Ravi, Sunil too is my enemy now. l will ruin the entire family so the fire of revenge in your heart is doused. l'll take your leave. -Wait, Jankidas. Give me my share. -What share? l got you this business. l should get 50 percent. ls that so? How dare you demand a share from me? You were starving and begging l took pity on you and took you in. You did not demand your share at that time. Remember that a weak man cannot fight a strong man. And if he tries, he is destroyed. So don't cross your limits. So you won't give me my share? -Yes, l'm giving it. Here is Rs100. Go buy yourself a drink and have fun. l'll tear you apart. lnspector! lnspector. lnspector, l want justice. Please save my family from ruin. Save me, inspector. Save me. Don't make a noise. Tell me clearly about the problem. Once l saved my wife from your brother's clutches. But when l went to jail, Ravi married Sharda. Not only that, inspector. Your brother has also taken his daughter away. Who's she? -Jyoti. What nonsense are you talking about? Jyoti has been brought up in our house right from her childhood. May be. But perhaps you don't know that... ...Sharda was in jail for murder for 7 years. And Sharda gave birth to Jyoti in jail. And here's the certificate from the prison. Why are you silent, lnspector? Because the accused is your brother and you don't want to take any action against him? What are you saying, Jankidas? l know inspector Sunil very well. When he is on duty he is not swayed by relationship of any sort. Look, inspector. Since this falls under your jurisdiction we have come here to lodge a complaint. lf, for some reason you hesitate to take action against your brother we will approach the higher authorities. Stop this nonsense. Go and register your complaint. You? Come in. come in. Please sit down. You have to come with me now. Has mother called for me? No, you will have to come to Nari Niketan. Jankidas claims that you are his wife. Until this is sorted out, you will have to stay there. lnspector, you forgot the main thing. About my daughter. l am so unfortunate. l haven't held her in my arms even once after her birth. l am dying to take her in my arms. lnspector, ask her where my sweet little daughter is. Rogue, get out of here or l'll kill you! See the way she behaves? Let go of me! -Stop it! Take her away. -No! No, l won't go. l won't step out of this house without Ravi's permission. You will have to come with me. -Stop! Let go of her. Nobody can take her from here. l have a warrant against her. But with whose permission you enter in my house? search There's no need for permission to get to the person to be arrested. There is. Because this is the house of a reputed lawyer not an illegal liquor den where police can just barge in. The charge is more serious than an illegal liquor den. lt's regarding an illegal marriage. -Shut up. You have no right to disgrace somebody's family. Who can disgrace our family more than you did? Today we are being defamed by the entire city. And you are responsible for it, brother. -No! l haven't commit any mistake. But you are disgracing our family by dragging Sharda to the court. Because now she is the honour of our family. Shut up, brother! You widowed your mother to marry her. For me she's a living corpse of my mother's desires and not the honour of my family. Sunil! -She is a memento of the painful emotions of father's final silence. -Sunil! She is the symbol of your lust for which you ruined your family. -Shut up! Do you know the consequences of raising a hand against a policeman? You will teach me law? Stop or else! -Or else what? Move. Sharda, move aside! Sharda! Sharda! Sharda! Sharda! What is it? -Aren't you ashamed? Go! Shameless! He hasn't brought his wallet. l am penniless. Listen, give me two plates of everything. Quick. Babulal! -Yes. lt's our shop. Would you like anything? -Sure. Why not? Make two plates for him. -Not two, make ten. l'm starving. -Ten? Where will you put them? -ln my stomach. Where else? Do you have enough space? -Of course. Give me some. Look how he's eating! You hog like a dog. -l enjoyed it very much. How much? -Rs.60. That's all? So cheap? -Thank you! Where are you going? Give him the money. Don't act too smart. l won't give a penny. You won't? -No. Remember that scary night of 7th December a murder in prison. -A loud scream. And a great man with laughter like a machine gun who fled from the safe deposit of Central bank. No, you're lying. C'mon. ls it? Am l lying? lt is absolutely true. Machine gun, come forth. Where are you running away? Come on. -My money. Give him the money. -Come on fast. l don't have money. Out with it! -Don't let him go. Where do you wash your plates? Where do you think you are going? Commission for going inside. -Permission, not commission. Nobody has the permission to go inside. What an injustice, constable! l've offered prayers for my wife's recovery. l've also brought offerings for you. Take a look. You're trying to bribe me? -lt is not a bribe. lt is to buy an energy drink for the patient. Energy drink? Sir, l've never seen such a devoted husband. The poor offered prayers for the sake of his wife. Let him go. -Yes. lf l don't, it will be a sin. -Big sin. All right, go. l'll get the energy drink. Hold it! -Give that to me. lt's been a long time since l've come across such a man. You? -Yes, it's me. Why are you here? l've come to wish you a speedy recovery. Then come to the court and grant me custody of my daughter. Shut up! lf you call her your daughter again l'll kill you. Disgusting! ln a cultured country like ours you shouldn't talk to your husband like that. Go away! Get out! Calm down! Don't be angry. l'll go away if you wish. But before leaving, l have some good news to give you. Our daughter, l mean your daughter studies in Gandhi High School, right? lf you don't confess in court that she's my daughter and Ravi is forcing you to marry him then in the graveyard near the school, your daughter l'll take your leave. l'll tear. Get her the energy drink. You will find your daughter in pieces. You will find your daughter in pieces. Jyoti! Jyoti! Grandma! Jyoti, my child. Grandma! -My child! How are you? l am not okay, grandma. l miss you very much. l miss you very much too. l can't live without you. Come with me right now. But the elder one will come and take me again. No, l will hide you somewhere where nobody will find you. Come. Mr. Jankidas, what do you want to tell the court? Your Honour, l've been telling everybody that Sharda is my wife and Jyoti is my daughter. But nobody listened to me. So l have come to you. Please help me get my wife and child back. Get me my wife Madam, Madam, listen. Come on. -Let me go! Get in. Move driver. -Help! The court summons Mrs. Sharda. Your Honour, the police have informed us that she's escaped from police custody. This is not true. lt's a scheme of advocate Ravi Kumar. He has kidnapped my wife. He wants to snatch my wife and daughter from me for good. He is an impostor and a cheat. Order! Order! -Let me go. Sit down. The case is adjourned until the main witness Mrs. Sharda appears before the court. lt's strange! Where did she go? Sir, madam came here and took your revolver. Hello. -Sangram here. That Sharda, who you must be worried about, is with me. Well done, Sangram! Great job. Bring her to me immediately. -Not so fast, Jankidas. You've made me work like a slave for several days. Now we will make a deal. You will get Sharda when you give me one million rupees. What? One million? l'll give you death, not money, scoundrel. -Death? Come to the 3 Aces clubs with the money in an hour or l'll hand her over to Ravi. Got it? Take this and go. l will bring back your money and Sharda. l will show that rascal that l am his boss. -Good.

Sangram, you are giving me my Sharda back. Thanks a lot. Jankidas, l want the money, not your gratitude. That's what l've brought. Look. No! Jankidas killed him, not your brother. Doesn't this revolver belong to you? But But l stole it to kill that scoundrel Jankidas. Because he ruined my life. But unfortunately, before l could reach him, l was captured by this man. lt's true, Sunil. He tried to make a deal with Jankidas they argued and Jankidas killed him. You are an expert in making up stories. Constable! -No, believe me. l'm telling the truth. Take this. -He is innocent. He did not kill him. l Move aside! So, finally this woman turned you from a lawyer to a killer? Mother! Mother! Mother! Who is it? You?! -Mother! Why are you here? ls there any happiness left in this house that you want to snatch? Brothers who loved each other were torn apart because of you. l lost my husband because of you. What more revenge do you seek? Get out! Get out of here! No, mother. No. Please don't talk like that. l didn't want to show you my face ever again. But today l was compelled to come to your doorstep. Mother, your younger son Sunil has arrested Ravi for a murder. What?! -That he didn't commit. So you've come here to appeal? Son, what am l hearing? Yes, mother. Brother killed a thug for this vile woman. No. That is not true He is being framed. He is innocent. Mother, l caught brother red handed. And all the evidence is against him. How unfortunate am l that l had to handcuff my own brother. And in the name of duty l will have to send him to the gallows. This woman is responsible for all this, mother. She. She is a stigma on womanhood. Only a woman with no moral would woo another man when her husband is alive. You are crafty. Characterless! No, mother! Don't say that. There is no slur on my name. And your son is not a criminal. We have not done anything wrong, mother. We have not done anything wrong. But we kept one secret from you and it's made you all detest us. Today l will disclose that secret. When your son was studying Law in Nagpur l was studying there too. We became friends and our friendship gradually turned into love. And then Not only our souls, our bodies too united. When Ravi found out l was pregnant he said that he would marry me soon. But my brother refused and said that he had borrowed 50,000 for my education. And until that debt was repaid, we couldn't get married. Ravi promised to repay the debt. Jankidas loaned us that money with the intention of making me his. He approached the village council to get back that money. lt was decided that if the money was not repaid by 4 PM on Monday l would have to marry Jankidas. On Monday, l waited for Ravi. But Throw him into the pool. But your brother just told us that Ravi deceived you. So, he will never come back. So, now you will have to marry Jankidas. No, l don't consent to this wedding. This wedding can't take place. Why not? Enough of your histrionics! The villagers and the village council will no longer believe you. l am not trying to influence them. l am helpless. l don't consent to this wedding because Ravi and l have crossed all the limits in love. l am pregnant with his child. Wow! Did you hear that? She has even learned to make up good stories. You are lying! She has made up this new story. Stop this charade! Take her away, and begin the wedding preparations. No. No, brother! l don't consent to this marriage. No. Let me go! Let me go. No. No. No. No! No. No. No. No. No. No. What is it? l got it. There's no younger one in the family so you have come to fulfil this custom. Take it. What is this? l want Rs30,000. 25,000 for getting you married to my sister and 5000 to pay the goons who beat up Ravi. l'll tear you. When we beat up Ravi and threw him into the pool you took the 50,000 from him, didn't you? You're not concerned with that money. Settle your account. Cool down, brother-in-law. Come tomorrow morning and take your money. Don't ruin my mood. Let me enjoy my wedding night. Open the door. Okay. l'll open it right away. Right away. You all killed Ravi! -No! l won't spare you! l won't spare you! What are you doing? She'll kill me! l won't spare any of you! l won't spare any of you! Run! Go and catch her! lf she reaches the police station we'll be sent to the gallows. Kill her, l said. Go! Where will you go? -Let me go! l won't leave you alive. -Let me go! He Help! He Help! l won't spare you! Ravi! Ravi! Ravi! Mrs. Sharda has confessed to her crime. So the court has no doubts on that count. Under lPC section 304 A this court sentences her to 7 years rigorous imprisonment for the murder of Chandu. No! Sharda! Why did Sharda do this? Whatever l did, was for the good of all of us. Why do you always sacrifice for everybody's good? This is not a sacrifice. -Then what is it? l committed the murder and you are being punished. This is not a punishment, Ravi. lt is a blessing in disguise for me. But it is a curse for me. How will you know what l go through seeing you in jail? l won't let you stay in jail, come what may. Don't talk like that. Think calmly. Whom do l have except you? lf you go to jail and l am outside who will protect me from Jankidas? Where and how long will l flee from him for our child? He won't let go of me. When he finds me, he will make my life hell. And then a mother will be dishonoured. That's all just in your mind. l'll tell the truth to the court. Stop, Ravi. lf you want to give your statement in the court go ahead. But remember that before the judge can give his verdict l will end my life. l'll commit suicide. After l was released when l came to this house for the first time, l asked him to tell you all the truth. But he was worried that after you knew the truth you may not accept me. So he lied to you. He brought my daughter Jyoti into your home and said she was an orphan. So she could have a mother's affection. But But look how unfortunate l am. l am losing my husband and someone has abducted my daughter Jyoti. Forgive me, sister-in-law. l was wrong about you and brother. l was the one who handcuffed brother and l promise to bring him back home safely. Don't cry, dear. l have hidden Jyoti. What? Really? Yes, dear. Come. Let's go, son. Ramlal! -Ramlal! What happened? Where is Jyoti? Sir, some thugs came here and kidnapped Jyoti. What? C'mon! -Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Take care of her. -Okay, boss. Let me go. -Or l'll tear you. Let me go. -Don't shout! Don't shout! A hundred rupee note on the floor? Wealth on the floor! Got it! Where are you running? A note runs in the bazaar, not on the floor. Lock it! What's going on? Who brought this cage? We did. You think your father is a cock? Open it! No, you are a crow. How can one mistake a crow for a cock? -Do something, dear. Get your father's coat, shirt and pant. Go. All right, uncle. -Uncle? You are calling this mongoose your uncle? What will you do with my clothes? l will wear your clothes, paste this moustache pose as Teliram and ruin you in a few hours. No! You are my brother! -Get lost! Who wants you for a brother? lf you act smart, l'll bash you up! You took 5 lakh rupees from me to get Teja released. But you haven't been able to do a thing. Will you do something only after my son rots and dies in jail? Today is the last day to file an appeal in the High court against the verdict of the Sessions court. Go and file the appeal! You are needlessly shouting at me. On what basis do l appeal? There is no witness or evidence. And you And you could not even make Priya change her statement. l will make her change the statement, lawyer. How? -Her lover's beloved Jyoti is in my custody. Come! Come in. Let's see how you don't change your statement. l'll kill you. C'mon. No! Please don't hit me. l will do whatever you say. Sign these papers. C'mon. -l'll sign them. But l won't marry your son. All right, but you will have to testify in court that Teja was not present when Sushila was killed. But Teja was present. Yes, but you will say he was not present .that you wrongly identified him. What if the police implicate me in the murder case? Don't worry. Nothing of the sort will happen. Why not? You killed Sangram and the police arrested Ravi. l didn't kill Sangram. Janakidas killed him. Janakidas? -Yes, l killed him. You killed him? -Yes. Whoever makes an enemy of me loses his life. My name is Janakidas. -What? -Jankidas. Sangram had kidnapped Sharda to get one million out of me. So, l killed him with Ravi's gun. And Ravi was accused of his murder. Why are you afraid? You are helping us. Sign the papers. Come on. Good! Very good! Come on! What are you waiting for? What about my money? Advocate, are you ready? Mr. Kishinchand, Teja can be saved now. l have such a strong case for an appeal that it will be accepted and Teja will be released. Daddy, l am here. -How did you get here? l escaped from jail. -What?! Yes. Mr. Kishinchand, no one can save your son now. Shut up. Advocate, if my son is not saved l will not spare your life either.

How tormented you sound. -And you are happy because you don't know what's in our custody. Listen to this. 'But Teja was present.' 'Yes, but you will say he was not present that you wrongly identified him.' Did you hear that? You yourself gave evidence against your son. Now your son will go to the gallows for sure. l will kill that traitor Teliram! lf you kill Teliram, even you will go to the gallows. No! l didn't do anything. lt was this traitor Chameli who did it. -Shut up or l'll knock your teeth out.
