(FLIES BUZZING) (CROWS CAWING) (BABY COOING) Ting! Ting! (BABY COOING) Our village was slaughtered because we rebelled against a corrupt government. Now, I'm the last, and must go into hiding. But you, my son... (BABY GURGLES) I will leave it... To you to decide your own fate. If you choose the sword, we will live and fight together. But if you choose your favorite toy, I will send you to heaven to join... Your beautiful mother. (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (CRYING) Shed no more tears, my son. From this day forward, we shed only the blood of our enemies. (WHINNIES) No! No, I'm too late! They're dead! Please forgive me. Forgive me! It's all my fault. Ying Lee, you're not to blame. I learned of the government's plans. I tried to get here to warn you, but I was too late. You did all that you could. Now you must save yourself. But what about you? I will be all right. No, you won't! (GRUNTS) (ALL SHOUTING) (ALL GRUNTING) (ALL GRUNTING) (CRYING) You coward! (YELLS) Why have you betrayed us? The government is too powerful for us to fight, so I have chosen to side with them. My family is dead! They got in the way of the new dynasty. (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (GRUNTS) How can you do this? Because you've got a bounty on your head. For money? Can you think of a better reason? (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) (PANTING) (CRIES OUT) Argh! (SQUELCHES) (GROANING) (GROANING) (GROANING) (BELL RINGING) (GROANING IN PAIN) Why did the master put those tattoos on us? Because now we have five parts of a map on our backs. And that map is the key to the Shaolin treasure. Uh, that way the government can't find it. Fong's right. They'd have to catch us all. BOY: Hey, wait a minute! I don't want a treasure map on my back. Hey! Quit worrying. There's no way they're gonna catch us all. Yeah, but what if they come after us? He's right, Chiu. What if somebody wants the map? What do we do? Come on. We'll kick their ass! We're Shaolin warriors. My back is still sore from yesterday, Dad. The monks put these tattoos... Don't speak of the tattoos. Do you hear me? Don't breathe a word of it. I don't want anyone to know you go to Shaolin. Why not, Dad? What's wrong with Shaolin, huh? Listen up! We keep it quiet out here because you never know. Any one of these people out here could be a spy for the government. You're afraid of the government? Well...(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Let's just say I don't want the government to confiscate all my wealth. You know, if they knew that I was raising a little rabble-rouser, the first thing they'd do is they'd take everything. So, you see, let's just keep everything that happens in the Shaolin temple between you and me, okay? All right. Let's get some ice cream. Come on. Excuse me. How much are the pears? Two cents each. Give me two then, please. Make it one. (CRYING) No! My poor, dead mother. What am I gonna do? Ting, I have to go in here and talk to your uncle. Stay out here and don't move until I call you. MAN 1: How sad. Her mother's dead. MAN 2: And she's too poor to pay for the funeral. MAN 3: If I had money, I'd help her out. Hey, now, listen. I'm charitable as the next guy, but I've heard tell of a mother-daughter team, con artists, who go from town to town. They pull these scams and steal people's money. She's too pretty to be a thief, huh? The prettier they are, the more devious. Am I right, fellas? CROWD: Yeah! MAN 4: Let's get out of here. Argh! (GROANS) Let's get you to a doctor. Look at him. He hasn't moved for 10 minutes. Hey, we'll make you move. Let's do it! (ALL GIGGLING) I'm sorry, Han, for coming to see you here like this. Think nothing of it. You and I are brothers. I've missed you all of these years. I know that you've been in hiding, and, well, if there's anything I can do to help, you let me know. I don't mean to involve you in my troubles, but I'm very concerned for my son's safety. Can you please take care of Ting for me, my brother? Of course! What kind of uncle would I be if I didn't? Did you hear there's to be a raid on the Shaolin temple? A raid? The government is looking for a map. It shows the location of the rebel treasure. They'll... They'll do anything to find it. Hey, what's your name, huh? I'm called Red Bean. Ah. Miss Red Bean! (GASPS, GIGGLES) I want to help you. First, I'll pay for your mom's funeral. Then, I'll make you my wife. Come on! Give me a break. What does she want a fat slob like you for? What's that? This is my business. Move along. (SNICKERS) What's your choice, sweetie? A cream puff or a real man? Unhand her! Huh? (GRUNTS) Hey, cheese wad! (CHUCKLES) Now, don't be angry here. We're both gentlemen. I'm sure we can work something out. It's best if you leave Ting here and be moving on. Hey, Ting. (GRUNTS) I thought I could trust my brother. How could you betray me? I'm sorry, but the reward on your head is great. I should have suspected when you mentioned the treasure. Say what? The Shaolin treasure map is a very closely guarded secret... Known only to a few rebels... And those who have become government spies. You are correct. But without your spear, how will you stop me? Huh? My spear! (GRUNTING) Here it is, Dad! (ALL GRUNTING) Hello, uncle. Kwun, please show mercy on your misguided brother. Nephew, please ask your father for mercy. Remember, there is nothing more important than family. (BROTHER GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (CROWD GASPS) (YELLS) (GRUNTS) (CROWD GASPING) That's my bodyguard. So, still want to fight? Huh? (GRUNTS MENACINGLY) Don't move, honey, I'll be right back, okay? Uh, excuse me, sir. What is it? I would like you to teach me to be a kung fu master like you. I cannot. Hey, I can pay! (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Nothing. Never mind. I had to turn him down. I know. Our mystical skills cannot be taught to outsiders. (STOMACH GROWLING) Hungry? Mmm-hmm. Where's the pear? It got smashed. We'll buy some noodles. How can we? We're out of money, remember? Let me buy you something to drink and we can get acquainted, okay? I would like that. (LAUGHS) Good. Let's go. You want a bodyguard? No, not a bodyguard. I said a teacher, okay? No teaching. Protection only. Well, if that's the case, I won't pay much. All you'll get is room and board, okay? Deal. Good. Then follow us. (CHUCKLES) Come on. Let's go. CHONG: (LAUGHING) Oh, they take your breath away, don't they? Go ahead, try them on. Ah, yes. Yes, one for each finger. They look beautiful on you, too. And there's more where that came from. All for my lovely new bride. You honor me with your greatness. Ah, but you will experience my true greatness on our wedding night. We have company. CHONG: Oh, yeah. Have something to eat, my pretty. (GASPS) Let's, you and I, discuss your duties while you're working for me. First, if I see something I want, well, you take it for me, whether it's another man's farmland or his woman or all of his money. You're to do as I say, and get it for me. Got it? I will only protect you. Not steal for you or bully. (LAUGHS) Come on, now. I know you're smarter than that. You can't go through life tiptoeing around every little thing. You must go out and take it. That's how I became so wealthy. Another man's property became my property. Another man's daughter became my wife. You see, it's all very simple. And if someone were to take your new wife or property, how would you feel? I'm not too worried about that, not with you around to protect me. Just obey my orders, you see. And above all, remember my golden rule, "Do unto others so I can help myself." (LAUGHS) I don't like that rule. CHONG: Wait a minute! All right. You just be my bodyguard. And if I need something taken, someone else will do it, okay? Let's get something to eat. (RED BEAN BURPS) I'm sorry. I guess I was hungry. An appetite. That's good. Hey, we'll get you something to eat later, okay? Come on, son. RED BEAN: Little boy? I saved this for you. Catch. (CHUCKLES) Here, Dad. Where'd you get it? Miss Red Bean. I don't trust her. Then I won't trust her either. Ting, do you regret living this way? We're a team, Papa. No regrets. Hey, Mom, come on, get up. Such a good actress even I believe you're dead. Playing dead isn't easy. Especially on an empty stomach. Here you go. Your favorite kind of chicken. Wait a minute! Are you holding out on me? Huh? Oh! I was gonna show them to you. You'll do more than show them to me, young lady. We had an agreement, we split the take 50-50. Please. Do you think I'd cheat my own mother? I saved the most valuable for you. Wow! It's beautiful. I don't know what to say. Fork over the good stuff. (GRUNTS) Okay, all right. You don't need to get violent. One for you, one for me, one for me, one for you, one for me... Whoa, whoa, wait! Don't try to sucker me. Let's start over. (SIGHS) If you say so. Mom, wait! No, I want mine! Chong wears a necklace. It's absolutely priceless. Why are we arguing over these trinkets? Then we must steal it. I know, but... But what? We'll have to find a way around his bodyguard. Hmm. Hello, how are you? Doing laundry? Like some candy? Uh-uh. Can I give you a hand? Can you help me get these stains out of my dad's underwear? Mmm. How are you today? Is there something I can do for you, Miss, uh, Red Bean? I'd like to sew you a colorful new robe, so just hold still. I don't need a new robe. But thank you anyway. Oh, but I want you to look nice... For my wedding party. It's very important (YELLS) to me! I think you may be making the collar too tight. Okay, let's measure the sleeves. (SCREAMS) Would you like me to measure your inseam? (GRUNTS) Careful with those. I know what I'm doing. Just leave it to me. I'm afraid I don't have the time. Won't take but a moment. It's going to look wonderful. I disagree. I'll fix it. I'm a great seamstress. Miss Red Bean, I've heard many stories of... A young woman in these parts who's really a con artist. I hope you're not accusing me. It's unwise to make an enemy of me. (SIGHS) Quit playing possum. Why'd you do that? We're friends now. Just a little love bite. If you're the young woman I've heard about, then we are not friends. How do you know? We might really get along. Don't play games. As long as I am employed in this house... I will not stand by and allow you to cause problems. Oh, okay. If that's the way you want it to be. But what would you do if I were to steal something from the master of the house? Don't force me to hurt you. Oh, I like that. You're sexy when you talk tough, you know that? You're gonna be fun. Ta-ta for now. (LAUGHS) What did she want? Nothing. Men act strange around pretty women. Their brains turn to mush and they do weird things. You watch yourself around her, Dad, because she's nothing but trouble with a capital "T." You are wise... Beyond your years. Well, Dad, I just worry about you. And when I used my kung fu on him, he didn't stand a chance. Huh? Whoa! And just what do you call that? Kung fu stance. (LAUGHS) You think you know kung fu? I do! Well, I learned from Shaolin. You think you're better than me, huh? No. Why do you keep your leg up in the air like that? My dad says I can't put it down till noon. You call that training? Don't do that! I went easy that time. But this time I won't hold back. (GRUNTS) Hey, no fair! Come on, let me go. (BOY GRUNTING) It is now noontime. (GRUNTING) Next time, I won't hold back. I'll get you! CHIU: (READING) "My Shaolin brothers, I have been humiliated. "Come help me seek revenge." Fly straight and true, my feathered comrade. All the way to Shaolin! (ALL YELLING) You want to live? Tell us where the boys are. Come on, move it! (GRUNTS) Search every boy. Go! What should we do? Hurry and find the boys. Quickly! Come with me. Get them into the tunnels! Come on! Move! Attack! After them. (ALL YELLING) It's been a long time. Can it really be you, Ying Lee? I thought you were killed by Kwun seven years ago. He thought he killed me, him and that magic spear of his. But I survived. I was cured by the Yihang witch. She made me invincible. When I was a boy, you were my master... So I will be merciful to you, old man. But only if you give me the map. I will never give in to evil. You stupid, stubborn old man. Sir, these boys were a decoy. Sir, a message. Hmm. The boys have a friend. That will be our first place to search. (LAUGHING) (ALL PANTING) Hey! Hey, Chiu. Hey, wait, you can't come in here. Go away! Hey, those are my friends. What happened? We had to escape from the temple. Huh? Did you get my message? Soldiers attacked the temple and burned it to the ground. And the master was killed and our friends were slaughtered. They're looking for the maps tattooed on our backs. Okay, get yourselves cleaned up and we'll go find my dad. No, no. I don't know anything about any boys. CHIU: Hey, Dad! My friends are here. (BOYS LAUGHING) Dad, these guys live down the street, and they've been bullying me. (LAUGHING) Hey, we've been nice so far. We're just trying to get the money you owe us. So pay up soon... (GASPS) Or we get violent. (LAUGHS) You little thugs! Beat it! Go on! Let's go. Is this your boy? Yes, sir. Doesn't he study at Shaolin? Oh, no, sir! I would never send him there. Those monks and priests, they're too strange. That's good to hear. (FLY BUZZING) That fly is starting to annoy me. Thanks for washing my underwear. But you tore them. I'm sorry. That's okay. I made a smaller pair out of them for you. Thanks, Dad. Does that mean you're not wearing any underpants? I don't mind. It's cooler. Did you fight with young Master Chiu? He started it. That was wrong. But what good are my skills if I can't use them? You must remember, son, that we are in hiding. If you show your skills, we might be discovered. I will try my best not to fight, Father. Eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18... Let's go. Ow! (GRUNTS) You made me lose count. All right, what do you want? What do you think? Time for a little payback, stupid. (BOYS GRUNT) I won't fight you. Yes, you will, tough guy. Come on! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Back off! Ow! (ALL GRUNTING) Leave me alone. Your only way out is to fight us all. (BOYS GROANING) And what happens if I defeat you? If you defeat us, we call you brother. (VOCALIZING) Huh? Let's go. (ALL GRUNTING) (BOYS GROANING) Let's attack! (YELLING) Come on! You asked for it! (GRUNTS) Ow, my shoulder! Get away! Your shoulder is dislocated. Be careful! Stay back! I can help make it well. (GROANS) Be still. Relax. (GROANING) (SCREAMS) It hurts! Whoa! Whoa! (GROANS) You're okay. Go on! Master Ting? Don't call me master. Call me brother. Please accept our humble apologies. And join us as a brother. Come on, guys, he belongs with us. Yes, a brother. I am honored. Don't chase us! Don't hurt us! No! (WHIMPERING) No... RED BEAN'S MOTHER: This should keep you sleeping. (GASPS) (GULPS) (CHONG SNORING) (WOMAN GIGGLING) I feel really strange. I accidentally swallowed the tranquilizer and... Mom! Huh? That's no tranquilizer, that's an aphrodisiac! Mmm. Ah! No wonder I'm getting so damn horny. Mom, focus! (GRUNTING) It's no use, I'm too horny. Argh! Be serious. I am serious. It's been so long for me, you have no idea! (CHUCKLING) It hasn't been that long, come on. Oh, knock it off, would you? Let's go steal that necklace before I explode. Ah, okay! Let's go! Wait! Don't forget the masks. (CHONG SNORING) Hand over that necklace! (SNORING) Come on. Wake up! (GROANS) (CONTINUES SNORING) Quit pretending. Unbelievable. Oh, hell! Let's get this thing and get outta here. (GRUNTS) Huh? Who are you? (ALL GRUNTING) Get him! (YELLS) (SNORING) RED BEAN'S MOTHER: Keep him busy. I'll get this one outta here. (GRUNTS) Gotcha! Help me. What a crazy dream. (GASPS) What are you doing here? Someone just broke in and tried to steal your necklace. (GASPS) This is priceless! You've got to catch them before they try again. They're not far. (GASPS) What do you want? Two robbers broke into the master's bedroom and tried to steal his necklace. Oh, my God! Robbers? Do you think they're still here? Actually, I do. Then why don't you look for them? Why are you in here? The robbers were wearing black jumpsuits. What does that have to do with me? What are you insinuating? What are you wearing? I sleep in the nude. I'll prove it to you. On the count of three. One, two, three. (GIGGLES) All right. But I warn you. Any further trouble and I'll have to kick you out. You don't have to be so modest. I'll give you one more chance. One, two, three. (CHUCKLING) I mean it. Any more trouble and you're out. I can't go. Tomorrow is my wedding day. Oh, my! Where's Mom? Gotta relax. Phew. Should I control my urges? Nah! (BOTH SCREAM) (BOTH LAUGH) I was so horny last night, I forgot to get the necklace. (CHUCKLES) Now we'll get it before my daughter has to marry this fool. Oh, good evening. Why don't the two of you go out and enjoy the wedding festivities? We have to stay and watch the bride. Oh, do you... Do you think there's going to be trouble? Actually, she is the trouble. This is going to be an interesting wedding. Oh. Hmm. (SIGHS) Hmm. Someone's on the roof. Ting, that's very observant. But we can't be distracted from guarding Red Bean. Understand? Yes. (RED BEAN SCREAMS) RED BEAN: No! Let me go! Don't hurt me! Fell for it, huh? Help! Rape! Sorry. Oh, no, Dad's in trouble. (YELPS) Oh! (ALL GASP) (GROANS) Red Bean! What's going on? Are you all right, my darling? What's wrong with you? How dare you defile my bride. I can't face you. Darling... (CRYING) Listen, I want you to leave here immediately. All right, I'll go. (INDISTINCT JEERING) Yeah, get outta here! Some guard you are! ALL: Whoa! (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (RED BEAN SOBBING) Let's go, son. Why? You should go out there and knock his head off. I don't know. That took a lot out of me. Honey... Put the master to bed, please. Come on. I've had too much to drink. Why didn't you explain what happened? They would not have understood. It's because you like Red Bean. You're wrong. You've always taught me to stay calm under any circumstances. But when she screamed, you jumped up like a jackrabbit. Ting, I, uh... It's okay, Father. I think I understand. (HORSE WHINNYING) (GASPS) They're heading for the master's home. What do you think? I want to go back and help my new brothers. You're right. (LOUD WHACK) (GROANING) (PEOPLE PANICKING) What do you want? (SCREAMS) (CROWD GASPS) Oh, this violence makes me queasy. Do what needs to be done, but get it over with quickly, if you please. We are searching for a group of boys. Five of them. The rest of you we have no interest in. Therefore, everyone over the age of 10 will be killed... Now! (ALL SCREAMING) (GROANING) Come back, you! (WHIMPERING) Let's pretend to be dead. Good idea. (ALL GROAN) Why don't you guys just beat it? 'Cause we're dead, just like you are. Now lie still, all right? Who says you're the only one who can play dead? Listen, you! I was here first. You guys are nothing but a couple of lousy copycats. (GROANS) (GROANING) Think you can fool me? (GRUNTS) Now you can stop pretending. (SOBBING) Those idiots, they can't even pretend to be dead. (GROANS) I don't believe this. You too, lady. (YELLS) I can't take it. Why, you... I can't take it. (MAN YELLING) (EXHALES) Going somewhere? Come back here! (EXCLAIMING) Master Kwun? The government still has a bounty on your head. Is it you who plans to collect it? It's time for you to die. (GRUNTING) Go get 'em! (EXCLAIMS) Boy, this thing's really on here. Oh! (MEN GRUNTING) Well, I guess that means the party's over. Time to grab what I can and split. (MEN GRUNTING) (GASPS) (SIGHS) That was close. (GASPS) Bring it on! Come on, let's go! (TAK CRYING) Help, you guys! Help! Come on, you guys! Chiu, go, go! (MAN GRUNTS) Master Kwun! Hello, old friend. Ying Lee? I know you're surprised. The Yihang witch made my body invincible. But it seems your soul is still corrupt. He killed your former master at Shaolin. They're looking for the Shaolin treasure. It's tattooed on our backs. He's captured four of my brothers, but I am the final piece. (GRUNTING) Take him. Come on. Go on. (MEN GRUNTING) Be quiet. MEN: Come on. Just a little longer. (MAN SNORING) (SNORING) Thank you for your hospitality. We'll return when things cool down. Sleep tight, okay? (GROANS) (GASPS) You undressed me! I had to... To get this dart... Or your wound would have become infected. I feel so dirty. Quit complaining. How am I supposed to feel? You've seen me naked. We're not even dating. You shouldn't be ashamed. You're beautiful. I know, you're just saying that, trying to make me feel better. Well, it's not gonna work, I can tell you that much. I know I'm sweaty, I'm dirty, I need a bath. I'm stuck in this horrible place, I've got this ugly bandage, this disgusting wound. I'm anything but beautiful! Just shut up! Learn how to take a compliment. Wha... I've got to go, save my son. Why didn't you save him before now? Ting's very strong. He can help the other boys. The other boys? KWUN: We have the final piece of the treasure map. Ting can protect the other boys if the empire discovers this. Meanwhile, I've sent word to the rebels to meet us at the Red Dragon pavilion. And the map? We'll have to rescue the boys from the enemy's stronghold. It will be dangerous. You can do it. I feel very safe with you. RED BEAN'S MOTHER: Red Bean! How dare you leave me behind! I had no choice. Don't you give me that! Oh, Kwun, this is my mom. (GASPS) Oh, my God! What happened to you? I was hit by a poisonous dart, but Kwun saved me. Oh, thank you, Master Kwun. He even cleaned me and dressed the wound. You mean you took her clothes off? Mom, nothing happened. Calm down, okay? (CHUCKLES) My intuition... Tells me there's something funny going on between you two. (GIGGLES) Step over here, Master Kwun. You and I need to talk. Get this, okay? If you're gonna court my daughter, I want to make sure you're wealthy. Ma, he doesn't have any money. Oh, really. No. But I respect her. Isn't that enough? Not in this day and age. Money makes the world go 'round. And if you don't believe that, you're just fooling yourself. Okay? I know you are too good a person to feel that way. Mmm, I don't know what you mean. Some things mean more than money. Like what, for instance? For instance, like saving the boys. You expect me to... No way. I'm not doing it. Wait. You distract them while I find a way in. Distract them? I'll do more than distract them. You should see me in action. Just distract them. What, you don't think I can do it, do you? I was a kung fu master in my day. (SIGHS) Don't move. (EXCLAIMS) I should warn you, my men are behind you. I don't believe any man who wears makeup. Take a look then. You think I'm gonna fall for that old trick, see? I meant there. I'm sorry. I mean, my comment about your makeup and stuff. (MEN SHOUTING) (YELLING) Help! Someone cut me down from here. How can you boys just sit there and watch me suffer like this? You're the one who got yourself captured. What do you want us to do about it? Get out of the way. Hey, look out! Son, get them to safety. Well, it's about time you showed up. (GRUNTING) Huh? What happened to all these guys? My dad killed them. Uh, that's awesome. He's a great fighter. Wish he'd adopt me. What do you think? MAN: I'll adopt you. You're all such pretty boys. Run! Up the wall! (PANTING) Come on. You can do it ALL: (SHOUTING) Come on (LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) Gotcha... Help me! Are you with me, my brothers? Come on! (ALL EXCLAIMING) (GRUNTING) Are you all right? Time to teach you a lesson, sweet meat. (GRUNTING) Dragon kick, brothers. (ALL EXCLAIMING) Elephant drop, brothers. (GROANS) Move! Kwun, let's go! Oh, my God! I can't believe you boys left me behind. This is a human being... Where's Dad? (GRUNTING) Don't you know by now you can never, never beat me? Somehow I will take revenge for what you did at Shaolin. I have to. (LAUGHING) You can do nothing. (GASPS) Perhaps we die together. Dad! Dad... We're partners. Ting, I want you out of here. (TING GROANS) I won't let you die here. I said, go on! (GROANS) I won't! (GRUNTS) Hey, ugly! Ting! (GROANS) Ting! Ting! Ting! Dad? Son! (COUGHING) What happened? (GROWLING) You're sure this is it? Excuse me, sir. We're looking for the Red Dragon pavilion. Don't bother with this old man, honey. He doesn't know anything that can help us. Come on. I don't know anything? I know everything that goes on here, and there's no Red Dragon pavilion. But I was here just 10 years ago. We've also heard of a Shaolin master living here. No such person. He is rumored to be in hiding. There is no Shaolin master... And no Red Dragon pavilion. There's only me and one other guy. He lives down the street a ways. Who is he? I don't know. Very weird guy. Keeps to himself. (TOWER CLOCK BONGS) BOY 1: What is this place? BOY 2: It's kind of spooky. RED BEAN: Can someone help us? TING: How come they're not moving? Hey, wow! You were just down the street. (LAUGHS) How'd you do that? (SHRIEKS AND SCREAMS) They're all made of wax. Wow! They're so lifelike. Ha! Anatomically correct. Are you done? Oh, my God! You scared me almost half to death! You deserved it. Of all the nerve. You're trespassing, all of you. Coming into my house, uninvited. Why, I ought to round you all up and torture you to death. Huh? Especially you. (GASPS) We heard a Shaolin master lived here. A master in this town? Don't be ridiculous. There's only the old man and me, the wax maker. They're beautiful. How did you make them all seem so lifelike? I use real human flesh under the wax. Would you care to be one? Ahhh! No! Mommy! We're sorry to disturb you. We'll be leaving. You're hurt. I have some experience in medicinal arts. Let me cure you, please. I'm sure I can... Thank you anyway, but we must be moving on now. But to where? This place is a ghost town. Death warmed over. The Red Dragon pavilion. The pavilion? Oh, that place. Uh-huh. Well, follow the path west out of town. It will eventually lead you right there. Thank you, sir. No, not "sir." Wax maker Biao. (SHRIEKS) Are you sure you don't want to become one of my statues, eh? No, no, no. (PANTING) Hey, guys, wait for me. This can't be the pavilion. There isn't anyone around. I'll take a look around. No. Stay here. This is the place, all right. Years ago, there were flowers everywhere. But no more. Kwun, how will the rebels ever find us? We sent a message yesterday. They'll get the word, and the rebels will be here. I'm sure of it. Is he okay? Keep an eye out, you guys. Yes, sir! Maybe we should find a place to hide in case the empire finds us first. (BOTH PANTING) An army of swordsmen heading this way. Take the boys and go. No. I won't leave you. Don't argue! (MEN EXCLAIMING) (MAN YELLING) The rebels. Master Kwun, it's good to see you. Master Chan, I... (GROANS) What happened? He fought with Ying Lee. I thought he was dead. I wish it were so. But the Yihang witch has cured him. He is now invincible, unstoppable, like a demon. We must be careful. He is after the boys. He is a truly horrible monster. He... He rides a metal horse. And he wants to kill us. Do not fear. My men and I can handle this. My invincible sword here can even cut through metal. I'm so glad you're here. This is great. Let's let Master Chan handle everything. Mom! We know a place where you can all can rest and clean to your wounds. Oh, Master Chan? Yes, what? Now I know where I recognize you from. Twenty years ago, I was the runner-up of the Miss Kung Fu World contest. And you were one of the judges. Well, I know you had kind of an eye for me back then. I don't know if you remember. (GIGGLES) Do you? Do you? Ah, yes. I think I remember that contest. Mom. Come see me later and we can get reacquainted, okay? (GIGGLES) You as nervous as I am? You know it, brother. This is killing me. Quiet. Hmm? MEN: Huh? (MEN GROANING) Attack. My sword! (GRUNTING) (BOYS CHATTERING) (GASPS) The boys are safe with mother. Don't worry. Thank you. All I ever used to do was steal and cheat. But since I met you, well, I think I'll turn over a new leaf. No more stealing. What are your plans? Don't know. Maybe you've got some ideas. All right, boys, eat up. If we're going to fight the evil empire, you need your potassium. Tell us a story, Granny. Oh, all right. You don't have to twist my arm. Well, when I was young, I was an expert dart catcher... The best in the land. One day an evil monk... Bam! Threw 300 darts at me. But with my lightning hands, I snatched 298 out of midair. Then, I caught one right between my teeth. But, Granny, what happened to the last dart? That last one? I caught it between my toes. (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, you guys, that's enough of that laughing. I could teach all of you boys a thing or two about kung fu. And you better believe it! Back in my day, I was known as a master. Why I once had a fight with 22 guys... Ahhh... Ghost! (ALL YELLING) All right boys, stay behind me. Oh, it's Master Chan. Look, boys, he's come to join us for dinner. Oh, what fun! (BOYS GROAN) Oh, Master Chan! Friend of yours? Oh, please, sir. Oh, please don't hurt us. These boys are so sweet and innocent. And I'm just an old woman. Have mercy. (EXCLAIMING) You think you're so bad. (MEN GRUNT) You take care of them. I'll get the boys out of here. Let's go! (GRUNTING) Keep going! (MEN YELLING) Let's bring it on, you sons of bitches! (EXCLAIMING) (MEN GROANING) BOYS: All right, Granny! (ALL CHEERING) Wow, Granny, you really are the greatest martial artist ever! You're so cute. (LAUGHING) Hi. (LAUGHS UNCOMFORTABLY) Congratulations. I underestimated you. Thank you. Now, be so kind as to let the boys and I go. (GIGGLES) No. But if you defeat me with your darts, then you can go. (LAUGHS) Silly. I haven't got any darts left. (LAUGHS MANIACALLY) What's wrong? You don't like the taste of my lugies, huh? (GROANS) (PANTING) (ALL CHEERING) Granny, Granny! Ah, come here. That was awesome. Can you teach it to me? You shouldn't have underestimated me. BOYS: That was great! Boy 1: Really, that was great! BOY 2: Grandma... BOY 3: How'd you do that? Can you teach me? Mom? Mom, are you okay? Oh, of course I'm okay. Don't be ridiculous. Go on, boys, tell her how great I was. She was awesome. Now, you take the boys on ahead. I'm gonna make sure this bastard is done for. You're coming, too? Mmm-hmm, right behind you. Come on, boys, let's go. BOY 1: Sister Red Bean? Your mother is quite brave. BOY 2: She's second only to Master Kwun. (GROANS) Ma! Ma, what's wrong? I guess I'm not as good as I thought I was. Be strong. Don't die, Granny. Please. I couldn't catch every dart. (ALL GASP) Granny! We've got to get you some help! (GASPING) I hope I haven't disappointed you boys. BOY 1: No, you're the greatest. BOY 2: Stay with us, Granny. Don't cry. What do you think of... This old gal, huh? Mom, you're just as beautiful and strong as ever. You wouldn't lie to me. Never. (ALL SOBBING) Enough crying. I'm not going to die yet. Come on, help me up. Come on, come on. (GROANING) BOYS: Master Biao, help us! (BOYS YELLING) Mom, Mom! Master Biao, we need your help. It's so cold. Don't worry, I'll get you warmed up. okay. BOYS: (YELLING) Master Biao! Here. Feel warmer? Mom, talk to me. It's funny how things work out. I used to pretend to be dead, and now... You're not gonna die. Mother, I won't let you. (CHUCKLING) My daughter... I... I... I don't want you to worry about anything. When I... When I get to the afterlife... The Gods won't know what... What hit them. Okay. (SOBBING) Now you go. I... And marry Master Kwun, and raise family. Ma? Mom... Can someone please hurry up and help us? (GROANS) Red bean, where are you? It's okay, I'm right here. It's so dark. Can't see. Please make sure the boys are all safe. Oh... (SOBBING) They'll be fine mother. You're a strong daughter. So very strong. (GROANING) I just thought of something. That guy we were going to rob. All the trouble we went through. And we didn't even get that... Stupid, lousy necklace. (SOBBING) (SOBBING) (BOYS CRYING) (BOYS YELLING) (BOY YELLING) BOY 1: Are you hurt? BOY 2: Are you okay? Come on! Come on, let's go. You must. Mother, I love you. BOY 1: Come on, hurry up! BOY 2: Let's get out of here! BOY 1: Go! Hurry, hurry, hurry! (ALL YELLING INDISTINCTLY) BOY: Come on. (RAT SCREECHING) (GASPS) (GRUNTING) All right, Ting, let's hit him up high and down low. Go! (GRUNTING) (GROWLING) Go! (GROWLING) Ting, get ready. Got it. (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) TING: Ahhh. Ting! Dad! (MAN EXCLAIMS) Who are you? In this town, I'm known only as wax maker Biao. However, I am secretly a Shaolin master. Let's go, Ting. Going somewhere? I have been in hiding here for many years. But when word of your evil reached me, I vowed to don my robes again to avenge my brothers. And I will get my revenge for Shaolin! You will die just like the Shaolin monks. Oh, you think so? You are beyond arrogant, as well as evil. Prepare to die. (GROANING) Now taste vengeance from my dragon fists. (EXCLAIMING) Everybody okay? Uh-huh. (MAN GROWLS) (YELLING) Brother! (ALL SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) Hang on, boys! Don't give up. I can't! I'm slipping. (YELLING) Hurry! Pull us up! (YELLING) Be strong, my brothers. Hold on tight. (BOYS BITING) (ALL SCREAM) Ting, I'm slipping! I'm slipping! (YELLING) My brother! (PANTING) We made it. (FARTS) Huh... Uh, get off of me... Please, oh God. (GRUNTS) You're gonna die. I told you you'd never beat me. (GASPS) Goodbye old friend. Stop it! Run! Honey, honey, wake up! (ALL SCREAMING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) (BOTH GROAN) Get up, honey! Please! Ting! (BOTH SCREAMING) Papa! Ting! (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) Come on, pull! (ALL STRAINING) We got you! (TOWER CLOCK BONGING) KWUN: You young men showed strength and bravery. And I commend you all. Li, Su, Fong, Chiu... And Tak. The masters of Shaolin would certainly be proud to know... That they have passed their legacy on to ones such as you. It is my deepest honor to call you brothers. Thanks again for your help. Come on, son. Sweetie, is your father coming? I don't know where he could be. Say, why don't you come with me? I'll teach you some more martial arts. No, thank you. Tak, you're welcome to join us. My dad will be here, I'm sure. Tak! Tak! My son! Father! (BOTH LAUGH) Are you Tak's father? Yeah, yeah. He's a fine warrior. (LAUGHS) That's very funny. But, thank you for saving him. My son? He is quite a man. I don't know about that friend of yours... Come on. But, it's true, Father. I am a Shaolin master. (GROANS) Tak, you okay? (ALL LAUGHING) Good to see you smile. Let's go, Mom. (HORSES NEIGHING)
