Um, excuse me. I actually think we should go somewhere cool and drink something cold together now. I'd really like to, but I have no more money and can't treat you, so I give up.

Nagata. (Saki) Mr. Nagata. What do you do for a living? It's not much of a living, but I write scripts for theatre. What, really? You do theatre? Yes, though mine's an obscure troupe. (Saki) Oh.

Mr. Nagata, did you read the responses to our last play? Those awful comments we received. Those are the mainstream views. I don't care about the mainstream. I knew you'd say that. If you had so many gripes, you should have told me then. But Mr. Nagata, you didn't listen to us when we tried to tell you. I don't mind having my works criticized, but I can't accommodate every opinion. What do you want to accomplish by telling me what other troupes think? You want to hurt me? Oh, did it hurt you? I didn't think you cared. Yeah, it felt like you were suggesting I should quit theatre. I apologize if you felt that way. Come on. If apologies are enough... OK then, let me say something so terrible to you that you'll never forget, then apologize right away. Care to listen? Huh? (Nohara) Nagata. Don't do it. (Nagata) Same thing, isn't it? An apology negates an insult, right? Aoyama, I could point out something really hurtful about your appearance, or I could insult you about the way you seem to think you're so hot. Which one first?

Well, actually, I have someone in mind. Who? That girl I told you about who laughs when she's angry. What do you mean? She let me have a bite of her crepe the other day, then started laughing soon after I gave it back. Why? She thought there was some kind of hard fruit in it, but actually it was my false tooth. (Nohara) Ew, gross. Right, that's the normal reaction. But she's laughing her head off. No way. When I listened carefully, I could tell she was mad. Huh? (Mimicking her) "But this crepe was so good," like. That was her peeve? She wasn't too bothered about my tooth ending up in her mouth. Strange person.

Don't say stuff like that. She didn't do anything wrong. I wouldn't make snide comments like that if I were the sender. I'm sorry. It didn't come across the way I intended. Mom isn't angry.

I mean, you hardly talk when you're around people you dislike or don't know. Have you been to Disneyland? (Nagata) No. I'd love to go.

Hey. (Saki) Huh? Nothing. You're angry. I'm not angry. But why didn't you stop? I wanted to ride a bit more. Hiding in such a dark place. I could hear the wind and stuff. It was really scary. But you chose to hide. Naga-kun. Sometimes I can't tell what you're thinking. Isn't that always? Usually I can understand. But... Sometimes I don't know how to deal with you. [I lied to Saki that I crashed it while riding it.] (Saki) That scooter carried lots of memories for him.

Not good, you should earn your own money. Well, I have it all worked out. You think she doesn't mind, don't you? No, I do think I'm causing her trouble. I used to only write theatre-related articles at first, but I've branched out and can't handle them all now. I was wondering who else could write and remembered you, Mr. Nagata. So you're a popular writer. No, it's nothing like that. So I was hoping I could ask you to write some articles. I'd be glad to. Really? Thank you. No, thank you.

I thought you ate them when you're happy because you're from Osaka. I'm not a typical Osaka person. Oh. Besides, "People from Osaka love takoyaki" is so stereotypical. Stereotypical? (Nagata) Hmm? What I mean is... "Tourists from overseas wear kimonos that are too short." "Pole vault athletes tend to have oblong faces." "Drunk women tend to walk home at night with their heels off." These are stereotypes. I don't get it. I only got the bit about the pole vault athlete. You got that one? What? (Nagata) (Laughs) Then how about, "Grandmas tend to fall asleep while knitting"?

I get up at 6 a.m. every morning and watch the news. Oh, wow! I do that daily without considering it effort, so I'm fine. I see. (Kicking sound) Shall I order the same one? (Critic) Yeah. The same. This is part of the job. It's not just some troupe's drinking party. Sorry. (Sighs) Mr. Nagata. The station's this way. (Car honking) (Exhales) [I wanted to see Saki.] (Nagata) Good evening. (Sound of bag placed on table) (Nagata) You'll catch a cold. Hey. Wake up. Did you drink a lot? Enjoy yourself? (Nagata) I don't know. Who did you drink with? (Nagata) People I don't know. You'll wear yourself out, so you shouldn't go anymore. You must be tired. I bought pears. (Nagata) Hey. Hmm? Is it safe here? This is the safest place. Yeah? The safest place is where pears are. (Grunts) Are you asleep? (Saki) (Laughs softly) I'm awake. If I asked you to hold hands, will you remember tomorrow? Huh? What do you mean? I'd like to hold your hand, but only if you'll forget about it tomorrow. (Saki) (Laughs) You're the only person who thinks holding hands is embarrassing. What's with that look? You're the one who wanted to hold hands. I still wasn't sure. (Saki's laughter) You know... I'm amazed you've managed to survive until now. Come here. [I feel comforted when Saki laughs.] [It even feels like I'm being scolded when she's not laughing.] [I thought I was scared] [of not being able to protect her from whatever, ] [but I was actually the one being protected.] (Cicadas buzzing) (Saki) Here. (Nagata) Yeah. (Exhales) (Exhales) Oh, it's Mr. Komine. "Not Dead Yet / Dai Komine" (Nagata) Huh? You know him? (Nagata) Huh? You know him? (Saki) Hmm? He's a regular at the pub I work at. He is? (Saki) Didn't I tell you before? The manager used to be in theatre. Did you? I did. And you said, "There are so many like that," and didn't seem interested. Actors in Not Dead Yet work there, too. (Nagata) Oh. (Saki) Wow. (Aoyama) Your girlfriend works at that pub "Adapter," doesn't she? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? Saki, right? I go to that place a lot with Not Dead Yet members. Oh, really? She's so sweet. Tadokoro tried to ask her out but was turned down right away. Who's Tadokoro? A Not Dead Yet actor who works at the pub. Oh. How long have you been together? How long? For a long time. I see. (Giggles) We knew Saki had a boyfriend, and she'd always speak highly of him, but when we heard the details, we all were like, "He's a jerk." It was so funny finding out it was you. (Laughs) (Aoyama) (Laughs) (Nagata) (Smiles wryly) (Aoyama) (Laughs) Hey, is it true you ate a takana rice ball at a convenience store during a date? Yeah. Gosh, why? That's hilarious! (Laughs) Yeah? Oh, but I wonder why Saki never mentioned her boyfriend is in theatre? (Nagata) Are you making fun of me? I don't get why you'd say that. Huh? Think for yourself. Hey. You know I'd never make fun of you. Even if you think so, even without malice, it's possible to hurt someone. You have a tendency to do that. I've never made fun of you. Because I know you're the best. I'm the best? (Laughs) Of course I'm not! I don't understand. Why... Why is this... Um... (Deep breaths) Give me a moment, please. Wait a sec. Wait. Wait. (Sound of can against table) (Saki) Naga-kun, wait. [I hardly went to her place after that.] [I stayed cooped up in my own apartment and worked on plays by myself.] [The only thing I'm entitled to do] [is to take action by myself.] (Clicks tongue) [Saki texted me, ] [but I couldn't bear seeing her in my normal state.] [Still, when I drank and felt uninhibited, ] [I really longed to see her.] (Scratching sound) [In the morning, ] [I became sober and felt terrified.] [I regretted coming, ] [and pretended to be asleep, which made me feel pathetic.] (Footsteps) (Saki) I'm... not a doll. [After that, sometimes when I went to see her at night, ] [she wasn't at home.] "Not Dead Yet 17th Production" [And when she was, she was often drunk.] "Not Dead Yet 17th Production" [And when she was, she was often drunk.] "Written and directed by Dai Komine" Did you go see this? (Saki) Yeah. (Nagata) With who? With the manager. You never come to mine. (Sound of can against table) (Sighs) You always tell me not to. I did go a few times in secret. (Nagata) Didn't you think I might not like it if you saw this play with another guy? Why? That's unreasonable. I mean, we just went to see a play. (Nagata) Are you that dumb? I'm not dumb. You always put me down like that. (Nagata) I don't. Just confirming. (Saki) You do. (Sighs) Naga-kun. Listen. If I were to praise other people's works, you wouldn't like it, would you? (Nagata) I wouldn't mind. You would. You even got annoyed when I praised Clint Eastwood! So I was always trying to consider your feelings. Hey, you probably haven't realized it, but... Not once have you ever complimented me! Do you get it? Who cares if I go to see some play? It sucked, didn't it? It was really, really awesome! (Sound of banging on wall) (Impact sound) (Nagata) I'll kill you! (Impact sound) Hey! (Saki) Naga-kun. Don't try to bluff your way out. You're being unreasonable. I've always been like this. (Sighs) I'm... turning 27 years old. All my friends back home are married. I'm the only one living like this. I endured hoping that we could live together someday, but you got your own place. I didn't care if you fooled around, I could forgive you so long as you came home to me. But... I can't tell what you're thinking anymore! I can't! (Crying) (Sniffling) [How long will I last?] [How long will I last?] (Chirping of autumnal insects) (Sound of door opening) (Sound of door closing) Drinking again? (Saki) Yeah. (Exhales) Drinking so much isn't good for you. I can't help it, we all have drinks after the pub closes. (Exhales) (Sighs) (Sound of jaw clicking) (Muffled) Saki. Saki. (Grunts) (Saki) The sun sets so early now. (Nagata) Yeah. (Saki) So quick. (Nagata) It'd be scary if it were always daytime. (Saki) True. If it were always daytime but the human body experienced night, or if night came around but we always felt like day, which would suck more? (Smiles) I don't know, that's too complicated. (Saki) See you. See you. (Saki) Yeah. [It smelled a bit like spring, ] [and I almost threw up.] [Saki had texted me a few weeks ago, ] [saying we needed to talk, but when I didn't reply, ] [she texted, "It's about our future."] [I was unable to reply to that one either, and this day had come.] (Cellphone keys) "Sending" "To Saki: Let's see the cherry blossoms along the pedestrian path." (Voices talking) "Pub Adapter" (Voices talking) (Voices talking) Me? No way, I couldn't. Want to try? Oh. (Tadokoro) Huh? Hey, wait! Hey, are you Mr. Nagata? Were you waiting for Saki? (Nagata) Oh, um... Sort of. (Tadokoro) Oh. Thought so. From that... That Oro... Oroka Theatre Troupe, right? Have we met? No, um, I've seen your plays before. I'm Tadokoro, I work here with Saki. Oh, I see. Thank you. You know, I liked that one production of yours. Um... The title was... What was it? Um... "The Forget"... "The Forgetting" something... No, that's not right. "Forgotten"? Sorry. (Nagata) It's OK. I know which one you mean. You know, I really got a lot out of that one. I mean, it was so over-the-top, I'd never be able to do something like that. Oh. Yes. Oh, hey guys! It's Mr. Nagata, Saki's boyfriend. (Nagata) Uh, no... Oh, Saki finished working today and left already. (Nagata) I see. (Tadokoro) Yes. She left with the manager. We borrowed the key and were drinking after hours. I see. (Tadokoro) Yes. Well then, I wonder what to do. She has something I need. Oh. I really have to get it now for work, so I'm in a bind. Uh, I forget where your manager lives. (Tadokoro) Oh, um... Close to Hanegi Park, I think. Near the library, right? Yeah, that's right. Oh yeah, I remember now. Thank you. Excuse me, then. (Tadokoro) Oh, hey, hold on. This is Komine, our writer and director. (Nagata) Oh, nice to meet you. Are you all right? Yes. Saki left already. Oh... It's OK. I just needed something for work. (Komine) Oh. I'll be going then. (Komine) I hope someday you put on a play again. I'll go see it. I'll go see yours, too. What's the name of your troupe again? Not Dead Yet. Oh. Got it. See you around. [I was scared to imagine how they were looking at me from behind.] (Chime) (Chime) (Repeating chime) (Sound of door opening and closing) (Footsteps) (Nagata) Oh, this one? I thought it was that condo over there. (Laughs) Let's go home. Where's the key? (Sound of keys jingling) I'll pedal it today. Oh, your bag. Your bag, your bag. (Sound of kickstand) Gotta put your bag in. Your bag. OK. (Sound of kickstand) Hop on. OK. (Nagata) There's a police box to the right so gotta be careful. If we get in trouble, stand a bit, Saki. If they warn us, I'll say with a smile, "She's floating so we're not riding double." Can you do that? Sing your favorite rap song back there. Oh, remember when we went to see that concert at Zepp in Odaiba? We were both covered in sweat, and so were the other people on their way home, and when you saw that, you said, "I wish everyone happiness." I really thought you were some kind of god then. "She's so nice." "I'm so happy," I thought. I kind of get it now. I think everyone should be happy, too. I also thought you were a god when I first met you. You probably thought I'd kill you, huh? Run away next time. I was unstable then and on the brink of death. But sensing you're about to die means you want to live. Philosophical, I know. I would have been in a really bad place if it weren't for you. So... Well, not "so," but everyone should be happy. Everyone. It's not working out. I wonder why? I don't have what it takes. I've been rattling on by myself, is it OK? God? Are you still back there? Are you cold? If you're not too tired, let's go see cherry blossoms by that pedestrian path. It was so crowded there today. But it won't be now because it's late. Let's go. Let's go. Have you seen cherry blossoms this year? Not yet, right? I'll show you some awesome ones. Don't look yet! (Birds chirping) [Around rainy season, Saki began having trouble sleeping at night.] (Thunder) [She started drinking more and was often in a drunken stupor.] Saki? (Thunder) Saki, what's wrong? (Sniffling) I can't understand if you keep crying. I was taking a walk for the first time in a while. (Nagata) Yeah. And... A young hair stylist asked me to model, (Thunder) But I turned him down because it'll wear me out. But... He forced his business card on me, asking for my contact number. When I told him no, he insulted me. What did he say? (Saki) Naga-kun. What did the bastard say? What's his name? (Saki) Naga-kun. Where's his card? (Saki) It's OK. No, it's OK. Hey, come on, it's OK. Hey. Naga-kun. Hey. It's really OK. No, don't. (Nagata) Don't worry. Don't worry, I'll watch what I say. (Male voice) I'd apologize if she were calling, but it's none of your business. You used your business card to insult her, so the salon is responsible. Get the manager. It's OK. It's OK. Get the manager! (Male voice) No. The manager has been so good to me, I can't cause him trouble. He's the one who hired me. That's not the point. Put him on the line. (Male voice) I caused him trouble last year... (Thunder) And I swore then that I'd never cause him trouble again. He's like a parent to me. You make no sense. I'm coming over so you just wait. Naga-kun, please. It's really OK. Please, it's OK. (Nagata) Don't worry, don't worry. I won't cause trouble. Just sit back and wait here. You have a crazed look in your eyes. Oh no. (Cellphone vibrating) "Aoyama" (Cellphone vibrating) Aaugh! (Breathless) I think you should break up with Saki. That's not for me to decide on my own. Let me ask you. Do you think you have talent? OK then. Do you realize other people think you don't have talent? That... I've known for a long time. (Nohara) I thought so. But you don't want Saki to think that. You can pretend not to care what others think, but if Saki thinks you don't have talent, it'll destroy you, right? You can't take that. You're scared of that. So you'll destroy her instead? Who do you think you are? Destroying Saki's talent out of cowardice. But... you love yourself, so you can't stop. (Nagata) I'm sorry. I have some disease that prevents me from listening to other people. Never mind. We know. I'm really sorry. You're always too serious. Well... But... I don't think we should have to laugh off everything. But... I do hope I can laugh at the very end. What a boring person. (Laughs) Hi. (Nagata) Drinking again? I told you not to drink so much. I can't sleep without this. (Nagata, smiling wryly) You're already plastered. And I hid your bottle of shochu. (Sound of glass against table) (Sound of finger-snapping) I can tell where you hide it right away. (Nagata) (Laughs softly) You talk big. Huh? I'll hide it where you'll never find it next time. (Saki) I'll definitely find it. Right away. (Nagata) How? (Saki) (Laughs softly) I'll close my eyes, and look for your afterimage. You're talking like me in my accent. Am I? Don't be silly. (Nagata) You are. (Saki) (Laughs softly) I'm not. And then I listen closely. When I do that, I hear a voice. Stop saying things that I would say. And then... I sleep. (Nagata) Why sleep? (Laughs) Stop using that fake Osaka accent. (Saki) I'm not. Don't be silly. (Nagata) You're being silly. Shut up. You're the one who's being silly. (Nagata's laughter) What's this? (Saki) I can watch what I want. Let's watch it together. ♪ ♪ From birth to death ♪ The human heart beats 2 billion times Which one do you like? (Saki) All of them. Each one has his own charm. I see. (Saki) (Laughs softly) ♪ This coincidence ♪ Is probably the most wonderful miracle for me ♪ When I'm with you, my love can't stand still ♪ I want to give the rest of it to you Naga-kun. Yeah? I don't think I can take Tokyo anymore. (Exhales) I see. Naga-kun. Will you be OK by yourself? I'll be fine. Yeah. My mom suggested I come home and rest. You'll probably regain your health after you relax back home. Do what makes you most comfortable. Yeah. I'm sorry. (Laughs softly) It's nothing to apologize about. ♪ It feels like I can travel through time ♪ How many more times out of the 2 billion ♪ can we spend together ♪ I want to believe in eternal love ♪ Not even a moment of the 2 billion... [Saki left her stuff in the apartment and went back to her hometown.] [She kept texting me repeatedly that she'd regained her health.] [It wasn't Tokyo she couldn't take.] [She probably wanted to escape me, who'd taken up] [much of her life here.] [Saki began working at a company near her parents' place.] "The Keyhole" "That Day" "Snap out of it repeatedly. Brightly!" "Clearly show change of expression." "Naga-kun is amazing!" I'm not amazing at all. This is how I've turned out. (Laughs softly) (Crows cawing) [How long will I last?] [When will my anxiety overwhelm me next?] (Doorbell) (Nagata) Yo. Wow, brings back memories. Hey, wait. You said you'd clean it out but you haven't done anything. I wonder if I can do it all on time. I did clean it out once but put everything back. (Laughs) I don't get it. Oh, there's my sewing machine. (Nagata) You're taking the overnight bus home? Yeah. You could stay overnight, you know. Instead of rushing home. It's busy having a proper job. Is that so. (Saki) Oof! I have to pack up without thinking or I'll feel sad. Then I'll end up causing you trouble again. Lots of stuff that bring back memories. Yeah. Found this when I was clearing the closet, look. That production we did. (Saki) Oh! That's my treasure! Wow, I took so many notes. (Nagata) (Laughs softly) Such a hard worker. This was a lot of fun, wasn't it? Yeah. When I reread this script, it struck me how the story is a simple one about a couple breaking up, and the lines sound like those from a school play, as if on purpose. Were they? I don't think so. It's full of holes, but when I read it now... It was a heartrending story. You're good at reading aloud. Read it. Yeah. (Saki) (Laughs softly) Why won't you stop joking around? Don't you have anything to say to me? Oh, you're reading my parts, too? (Laughs) Then you can read the woman's parts. OK. I'm not trying to joke around. But you are. With that foolish grin. This is just the way I look. You joke around. Talk seriously. Do you get that I'm leaving this place? Then I'll be alone. It's... your own fault. You know, I caused you so much trouble. Huh? Naga-kun, that's not written anywhere. I caused you nothing but trouble. Where is it? There's no such line. And I didn't really want you to work at night. If only I had a stable income. I guess I don't have what it takes. Are you coming up with those lines now? I can't stay with someone like you. Why? There's no way. I loved you even when you were poor before, but nothing ever changed. Still, though, I wouldn't have liked it if you'd changed. So it was inevitable. The truth is, you didn't do anything wrong. Because you never changed. I was the one who felt pressed into growing up and changing. So I hated myself more and more. What a loser, huh? When I first came to Tokyo, I kept thinking, "I don't have a chance here." "I'm not prepared at all." So meeting you made me so happy. Is your memory OK? That was me. No. I was looking for a reason to give up. Even though I hadn't done anything wrong, I always felt sort of weirdly guilty. Thanks to you, I was able to walk the streets of Tokyo feeling happy and not miserable. If it weren't for you, I would have gone home long ago. I'm sure of it. So... Thanks. (Laughs softly) Your turn, Naga-kun. Recently I'd been thinking about what theatre can do. And I realized, it's everything. What can be done in theatre can be done in real life. So as long as there is theatre, there's no reason to despair. Get it? I get it. So... What I'm going to say now is all true in a way and they're things that can be realized. You'll go back to your hometown. You'll work there and regain your health. I'll continue to do theatre and evolve significantly. This might sound trite but I might become acclaimed. I might be able to earn a lot of money. You will have recovered by then, so we can go eat lots of good food. You know those thinly sliced blowfish? Let's shovel 'em in! You like sea urchin, so you can heap as much as you want on rice. If people give us the side-eye, let's move on. But by then we'll be full, so we'll take an express train to a hot spa. Enjoy an outdoor bath by the sea and watch the sun rise. We'll set the alarm so we don't sleep in. Eat breakfast properly. Rice, miso soup, grilled fish, and natto. And we'll read novels at a nice café during the day drinking coffee. Oh, I guess we've already done that. Then let's go to an amusement park overseas. Ride every ride twice. I'll have a passport by then. I'll buy you everything you want. I know! I'll buy you a wallet. You kept using the one I gave you long ago even after it wore out. Do you remember you lost it once and came home crying? We went looking for it by the station, and found it lying on the edge of the gutter and we shouted. Yeah, let's go overseas to buy a wallet. We could even dare to go wearing kimonos. A day like that is good, too. Let's get a really big dog. And live in a big house with a roof balcony. We'll have a grassy yard and grow seasonal flowers. We'll spend happy days, and when we turn 60 years old, we'll buy ambiguously colored teacups and drink tea at the right temperature. I'm sorry. (Actress) I'm sorry. Saki, you got your line wrong. You'll be waiting there so I'll go home early. I'll turn down every invitation. Going to see the person I want to see the most. Why was I unable to do such an obvious thing? You'll welcome me home in a cheerful way. You can do that, right? And the big dog will jump at me, and maybe bite my shoulder a bit, but by then I'll be such a dog lover that I won't feel any pain. I'm sorry. We'll eat curry, and once we're full, we'll take a walk in the neighborhood. When we come home, we'll eat a pear. I'll peel it this time. ♪ (Nagata) Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Saki, come on, that's not the way. Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! ♪ (Music) (Applause) ♪ (Music) Theatre: A Love Story
