Sultan, please, give me five. Are you ready, Cratos? Go! Go out, Dani. Go, fatty! Go, Sultan! Giada... Giada! Go, come on... Come on, Giada, go! This coffee is excellent. Number one. How did you make it? Nescafé. - It's disgusting. Once there was the moka pot, Caffè Kimbo... You called me, please, I brought you a coffee. I'm not complaining. Very nice of you to bring me coffee. What can I do? Tell me, how can I work with... four animals? Now that Rambo's gone. - It's not the first time a tiger dies. I know, but I raised him, played with him. I even walked him on a leash... in a theatre. With Indian dancers dressed in blue. And Rambo doing this. He wanted to eat them. - I said: Rambo, stay. And he would look at me. Pff Pff... How can I work with only four animals? It's a disgrace, Wendy. It's not a tragedy. It's no tragedy for you, you depend only on your body, your number. It's not like one tiger's gone and you stop working. You have the others. So what do you do? Nothing. I stop working. - Shut up! Panico? Not there... I figured something out, while I was driving in my car. I want to show you. There's a street going downhill, but you climb. Do you see what I mean? - No, I don't understand. You see the street going downhill, but if there's a bottle or something rolling it rolls the other way, upwards. You throw it far away, and it slowly comes back to you. He doesn't give up. You are fantastic right now. See, Sultan doesn't harm him. I could even put them together. The dog's a little scared. - No, don't put him down. He's barking at him. Don't tease him all the time! He barks at him. Come here, baby. You're better than that tiny teacup dog. Give daddy a kiss. Thank you. One more kiss. You're irritating when you do that. - Thanks for the coffee. You're so beautiful! Someday I'll marry you. In church or in the town hall? In the town hall, thanks. This morning someone called me and said: "We're going bankrupt." And I answer: "Is it my fault?" It's the crisis. - The crisis? In fact all circuses are working. I don't understand why ours isn't. - Too many holidays. Couldn't we do four days in Olevano? Four days where? - Olevano. There's been no circus for five years. Mayl? This morning I took down two chickens, 'cos we don't have anything to eat. One was 3 kg, the other 3.8 kg. - Huge. Not bad. At least we have something to eat. Come on, Corrado. You're at least a 1.000 Euro man. 1.000 Euros when, every six months? - No, a day. Gold watch, gold frame glasses... What else? Nice car, cool clothes, what more do you want, Mr Corrado? All that hard work. - And you never do anything. Poor thing. So much hard work for a jackass... Listen, ignorant. I just cleaned the table. Didn't you see me? So why are you putting your feet on it? It wasn't on purpose. - You do it all the time. It's a bad habit of yours. - I wasn't thinking of it, I was talking. He was thinking because he's got so many problems. My mind was somewhere else. - Unbelievable. Now, my mind is somewhere else so I'll just go piss on your bed. No, hey, Othello... What was that? I don't know. There he is. I almost destroyed your caravan. It's alright, we'll put everything back. The old man in the wheelchair. Doesn't he have the other leg? - No, he lost it in an accident. How much stuff! - Put it down, don't touch. Putting it that way is bad luck. - I don't know if it's bad luck. That wayluck falls in, and stays inside the horseshoe. But I don't know if this brings bad luck or maybe has no effect at all. Let's try. This doesn't compare to mine. - Mine is nice too. Cute. - Leave it, I'll tidy up later. I'll put it back, that's better. - Stop it, sit down. Play with that... Today my whole body hurts. - How come? I'm tired, my back aches. I need to change jobs. - Why? I've got back problems, I can't go on like this. You're right. What will you do? - I'll work something out. You can do a new number. That's the idea, but it takes time, I need to practice, you can't do everything just like that. I've been doing this since I was five. For me to change now is... ...a tragedy. If he bites your nose, I'm happy. - Who? This little runt? So? - Look, it goes up, but the street is downhill. See, it's downhill and I can't push the car. And now the other way... I'm the strong man, look! It's moving on its own... And there it's uphill. See? Bye. - Stop Tairo, it's dangerous. Look how strong I am... just one finger... Look, there's no explanation. I never understood anything. Because some say this, and others say that. So I never understood how it works. But it does. You, there! Are you running uphill or downhill? Uphill. The water isn't flowing down. See? It goes up. - See, it flows uphill. This is an anti-gravity problem. That's why it goes uphill. Everything that usually goes downhill, goes uphill. It's an optical illusion. - An optical illusion? Look there, it's higher than here. It's not an optical illusion. - That's true. It's a point of discontinuity of the Earth's gravitational field. What do you think? Because opinions differ. It is... a matter of perspective. I unplugged your cable? Me? Who was it, then? - How should I know? You plugged your cable in, in order to clean your caravan. Excuse me, there's the panel full of plugs... I have the right to plug mine in. The panel you're talking about... The first day I got here it was plugged in. So you can't say it was me. You unplugged it. I saw you. You and the worker there. - Me? Yes, you. The Portuguese and the Romanians came to Italy to be Mafiosi. That's right. I want to be a Mafioso in your country. How's that? Watch out, or I'll send you to Romania cut to pieces. Look at him. Look! Watch out, or you'll see where I send you. Tairo! Jerk! Undersized idiot! Why won't you eat? I've called the vet, sweetheart. My old lady's 20, she's old. The vet's coming. He'll bring medicines, don't worry. Everything's going to be okay. Tairo. What do you want, Indian? Jackass. - Get out of here. Go to hell. Did you unplug my Mum from the mains? Don't ever do it again. Or what? - You'll regret it. Get out of here, idiot. I warned you. Bug off! - I warned you. Watch out! You better not unplug my fridge. Or you'll get this fork in your back. Watch it! Jackass. I know who it was, that jackass... Oh no, everything's missing. Dammit, my iron amulet... Where the hell did they put it? Damned Daniel. Cratos, no, what's up with you today? No, no. Good boy. No. You don't do that to papa... Cratos, what is it? This lion's gone crazy. Do something instead of smoking, help me find it. Even the iron amulet is gone, and without it, I'm not working. You've decided that you're not working? - Yes. Look for that stuff. I am looking, but there's nothing here. Are you sure? Absolutely, my iron amulet's gone too, clothes, money, all of it. The show is starting, do we have to look for that stuff now? When otherwise? Excellent. Let's take a look around, maybe there's something else here. Maybe we'll find it. Hey, don't you knock? The door was open anyway. - How dare you? Think about what you're doing. - What have I done? You know exactly. Are you joking? - No, I'm damn serious. What happened? - You took Tairo's iron amulet. Me? - Yes. What iron amulet? - It's important to him. You shouldn't have done this. Listen, I don't like Tairo, but I don't have time for this crap. I don't even know what you're talking about. And when you cut off his power? - Me? Yes, it was you. - Are you crazy? How dare you... You'd better give it back, or I'll... I don't know what you're talking about. Get out! Look at that mess. You and your iron amulet... Get out of here. Lunatic. You're not working? I'm not, uncle. I can't. Why can't you work? - Because Giada is not well, she's sick. Cratos is aggressive. I can't go on. What do you mean by that? - I don't want to. Use two animals, but do it. No, uncle, I'm not working. No way. The show must go on. We've advertised, you can't not work. You don't have a good reason. Yes, I do. They've stolen this thing that is important to me. What is it? - A good luck charm. It's only a thing! Tonight I'll tell the audience... my tamer isn't working because of some "thing". Don't put me in this situation! Tonight you're working, do your best. When we leave this place, we'll be off for four or five days. Take your car, go and... find your lucky charm, find yourself. But if you come back... you have to do a good job. Your head must be okay. Go, Cratos, come on... Take my place, I don't feellike... Watch out, keep a cool head. Damn place. The Italian tamer, Tairo Caroli! No, Dani, come here. Here. Good girl. Here. Go! You've been taking the circus down for five days now. You've been cleaning your chairs for a week. Clean mine too! - Get lost! Poor thing. He's out of his mind. Look, the Moon, the Fool, the Hanged Man... He's lost control of his life. It's slipping through his fingers. Why didn't he come to me? - He doesn't like these things. Does he think it's satanic? He didn't even want me to do it. But you're here, see? Anyway, there's a solution to the problem. The Stars represent the future confirming it. There's Justice, the Hermit, walking slowly, and the Sun. Let's lay the last six cards. A man will come to him, a man he already knows, and he'll show him how, after so much effort, to solve the problem. The Lovers show there's a solution. And everything will be as it should. Is he going to find the thing he lost? - No, I'm sorry. But the solution is here, this man. She told me that you'll find the solution in an older person. I don't care. Your problem. My problem? I did it for you. - For me? Shut up! I think you've been given the evil eye. - Evil eye? That's a good one! I'm going. I don't want to hear this crap. Please, Tairo... I told you, I don't like it, and you do it anyway. You try to help, but that's not the way. And tomorrow I'll leave and I'll find another iron... without your satanic help. Goodbye! Go, go, go. Son of a bitch! Fucking lorry driver. Hi, Dani. Hi, how are you? - Fine, thanks. What's up? - I've come to see mum. How old is she now? - She's old, poor thing. She's over 40. Chimpanzees are like primitive men, theylive 40 or 50 years at the most. She's done a lot in her life. She's worked with Fellini, "Bingo Bongo" with Adriano Celentano. She's so beautiful. Dario Argento's "Phenomena". She's doing another movie, we're rehearsing. Make a face. Good girl! Is she jealous? - Jealous? She loves me more than your mother. Doesn't it make you cry? I don't need an onion to cry. Sometimes life is tough and makes you cry for a whole week. That's true. When did Arthur bend the iron for me? You were a child. - A small child? Yes, my love. We went to see his show... Arthur Robin bent an iron bar and gave it to you as a lucky charm. A lifetime ago. 13 or 14 years... - Maybe even more. You bet. Time flies... What's the problem? - Nothing, just asking... Do you know if he's alive or dead? I'm pretty sure he's alive. What time is your show? - Todayl have no show. Why? - I've taken a week off. What? - I've got things to do. Everything's going wrong. What's the matter? Are you having bad luck? Life has its highs and lows for everybody. Move. I'll show you... bad luck is no big thing. You know why? Because your mother... has always solved it like this... Not these things, mum... - Which things? Those circus people beliefs. This is how you do it: One, two, three. All the rest is behind me. All the rest is behind me. And the strength is inside you. Understood? You are the strong one. Not really. - You create... your life, your career, and your self. It doesn't matter what happens, good or bad, you must keep going. Keep going and look at the future. You know I was an arm wrestler, a fairly good one. When you're like that, you try to... It's a trick, you grab him like that, the first thing you do... is this. See? You're already half way down. And here you've got more strength. It's not very fair, but... You'll always win. Get hold of the table with your hand, one here and one there. Okay, good, go. Pull, pull. Use your shoulder. Go, go, go. Well done. - He's good, isn't he? Congratulations! No, mum, I want to go with him, please. Let her come with me. No, she must do her homework, tomorrow she's got school. Mum, come on. Mum... Listen to this song, maybe you'll recognize the singer. Let me hear. - It's a song from the old days. The old days... Do you know him? - That's my brother. Do you know this character? Uncle Mirco. "This is the best time, come on, the sun is shining..." Come on, the sun is shining. - Come, it's late. "Leave your home, your sadness... and try to dream more." Turn up the volume, Greta. "Try to look at the moon... like a poet does..." Look, who's there, the gipsies... A kiss from both of you, right now... Full of love. Wait: what are you doing at home? We're sick. Why aren't you at school? - Because I threw up. And you? - I threw up all night, and this morning too. You're both fine. - No, we're sick. What do you want, shorty? Why are you hitting yourself? Why is your brother hitting himself? Where's Patti? - She's making coffee. I'll have some. Have you stuffed your belly? Shut up. - Have you? No. - And you, have you stuffed your belly? I don't have a belly. - What do you mean? I'm a stick, don't you see? - What are you? A stick. - Let me check if you're a stick. You're fat. If I'm fat, what are you? I'm a stick. - No. You look like a hippo. Leave my brother alone. Are you ready? Jesus, you're heavy! The tyre is flat. You'll burn the handle. - Turn the flame down. No, leave it. I don't like it that way, leave it straight. That's not straight. It doesn't matter, I just want coffee. I don't care. It's almost done. Get off me. You've grown old. Once you were a fatty, but firm, solid. Now it's all pfff... Nothing can be done, it's time passing by. "It's time passing by, and you don't feellike a child anymore..." You're an angel today. How come? Tell me, how are your animals? They're fine. Rambo is dead. That's a good one. Why did he die? Old age. I called the vet, he had stomach cancer. Did you have him put to sleep? - No, he died. And Giada is too old to work. Cratos is in heat and aggressive... - The rest is okay... The rest is okay. I can work with two animals. And you jump through the hoops... - And the tiger says: "Come on, Tairo!" Give me some sugar, please, life is bitter enough. Me too, please. I like it sweet. Arthur Robin... I don't know him very well. I hope he's still alive. And healthy, because he must be old... Let me think... Some time ago I heard... that he had returned to France, or to Guadeloupe, where he comes from. I don't remember exactly. Come closer, Asia. I'll tell you a story, but you must... Hold still, Donald... ...a story, but you must keep it secret. Don't tell anyone. Look at me. Promise? And you? What's this? Do you promise? I'm looking for Arthur Robin. Do you know Arthur Robin? Many years ago... when I was a child like you, he was very strong and won "Mr Universe". Those guys who do bodybuilding... He would take an iron this long... and that thick, bend it... and give it to someone. I went to see his show with my mum and dad. He bent the iron and gave it to me. And it has become my lucky charm. Do you know why? Do you know? Because it's bent? - No, not because it's bent, because he gave it to me and we went home. While we were driving back we had a serious car accident. Dad was driving, he passed a lorry in a curve. It was raining... the car began to spin, and bang! Against the wall? - Yes, it was very bad. But I think, that thanks to the iron amulet... nothing happened and we're all alive. The police came and everything was fine. Do you believe in good luck charms? No, I don't, but in this case I did. I believed in it. Do you believe in Santa Claus? And you? Do you believe in Santa Claus? There's no Santa Claus. Of course there is. Come here... Are you hungry? A little bit. - You could have come earlier and eaten with me. I've already eaten. Look in the fridge if there's something. There should be some soup. Do you want me to heat it? No, I just want to taste. You should've come earlier, and eaten with me. I was talking... You didn't call me... - Do you want it in a bowl? Are you staying tonight? - Yes. Where can I sleep, gran? On the couch. I'll bring you something... Have you got a blanket? - Sure. I also have sheets. If you want I can make you a real bed... No, the blanket's enough. Put that back in the fridge. Who cooked this? I did, who else? Are you still eating? You're always eating. Shut the door. Is this your watchdog? Yes, he's my watchdog. Sit, lay down, good boy, stand up... Tairo, is this blanket enough? Or do you want more? Are you sure it's enough? Good night. Be a good boy. And you be a good girl. - I am. Such crap... It's not healthy... - Gran, have a drag. Aren't you leaving? - Have a drag. Stop smoking, it's not good for you. You're always smoking, every time I see you. I want to die with a cigarette in my mouth. Go. When are you coming back? - In two or three years. Bye, drive carefully. Dammit! Uncle, where are you? Start the engine and turn on the heating. Cold or hot? Uncle? Cold air or hot air? - Hot air. When you turn on hot air water circulates in the engine. Have you noticed any leaks? There was no water. Why don't you sing instead of eating? I don't feel like... Come on: Batti cuore, batti per amore... Thirty years... It's been thirty years since I've sung that song. I was 19. Now I'm 49. That makes 30 years. Really? I haven't touched my guitar for years. Why? Because I don't think that my voice is good enough to make me famous. "Hey, I've got a nice voice, and I'll become famous..." Even Gigi D'Alessio has become famous, uncle! Have you ever heard him? Those people studied... - Studied? Studied? Come on! I threw away all the CDs I recorded. All of them? - Yes. Why? I didn't like it. Too many mistakes, because at the end it's always ohhh uhhh ahhh, and that's not good. If you get rid of those mistakes... I would need to record them again, but it's not like the old days. I used to have fun, I had friends, we went to the beach. The fire and a lot of fun. Now I don't have any friends, everyone's in a hurry. It seems like... there's no friendship, there are no values like before. Everything is fast, money... Those with money don't talk to you. Those without... must work to make a living. It's not like the old days. Come on, uncle, I know you want to... Deep down you want it... - Not now... "Batti cuore, batti per amore, sento che c'è lei..." You're begging on your knees? Beat heart, beat heart until you die, because of her... You can't find the notes? - I know the first part, the rest we have to improvise. The right road is the one tread by your heart Running along beaches, longing for love Leave your home, your sadness And try to dream more Look for love in what you do Beat, heart, beat strongly inside, I feel she's there Light the fire of a sun gone dark Too long ago Beat, heart, beat for love Do it, now you can Never stop Beat, heart, beat strongly inside, I feel she's there Poor guy. Sit. Hey. Christel, give it to me, I need it. What are you doing? - Go to your bed, Panico. Go to your bed. What are you doing? I must make this candle against the evil eye. What is it? - The evil eye... is when a person is envious, and says: I hope you get tummy ache, or that something bad happens to you. Tairo has seen many bad things happening to him, so I'm making this candle for him, to purify his house, his spirit and everything. Who told you how to do it? An old woman who lived near my house, a very old gipsy woman. One day, while I was walking down the street, she called: "Wendy, come here, I think you have the evil eye, come with me." I went to her house, she made me a candle and told me to write the name of the person. That's why I'm writing TAIRO. Let's write Tairo's name. Can you read it? - Yes. Luna, you can't read. But she can see there's something written. Then you put it in a bowl, like that, with water and salt... Near... - You light the candle, and when the candle is burnt down, you throw everything in a river... or flowing water, so the negative things flow away with the water. It worked for me. Look, the lighter flame is big. This means the candle will burn faster. A good omen. Panico, don't push me! Stop it. Let's go. So, what's up? - Nothing, the usual, aunt. Everything okay? - Yes, more or less. How is work? - Good. You are a woman of the world... Tell me. A woman of the world. Where is Arthur Robin? Arthur Robin... Was Arthur Robin that strong man? I haven't heard about him for a long time. He bent iron... - He was very handsome. I know that for a year he worked at a zoo, not really a zoo, a... A circus guy opened a park. Right, the one in northern Italy. - Yes. He opened this park and he worked there in summer, but now... Oh, he worked there. - I'll give you some milk. I think I know what park you mean. It's a circus park. Why do you want to know? - Just curious. Do you want to be a strong man? - Yes. And bend iron. Maybe I could bend aluminium. Come on, let's eat. - What did you bring, uncle? Is it cold, uncle Omar? - Very! Push. Abracadabra, up, and down. There's also a piece of pizza. There's another bag. - Where? Are you still cold, uncle Omar? Megan, be careful. Move the table, Omar. Very nice of you, cousin. Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy. Push... It's not working. Don't sew me into the jacket. Almost finished? And you? - It's not really straight... Not really straight? It looks fine to me. I could've taken it off. I don't understand why I didn't take it off. But never mind. I think she's too young to use make up. Okay, you are 20, but she's only 15. I'll hit your head so hard, you'll wake up when you're 23. She puts on make up. Lucky you don't wear heels. She has them. - Really? Circus, circus. Look for another job, girls. Listen to your stupid cousin. Listen to your stupid cousin. If you're working, I want to see the show. Come in. - May I? Are you still in bed? Why are you here? - I've come to see you. Too good to be true. You made it, after four years. - Four years... I was always the one visiting you. I ran out of coffee. - Stop joking. Keep looking. Strange but that's how it is. Maybe down here? Stop that, brother. Nope, I must go buy some. Sonny, do you remember Arthur Robin? Sure. - Also known as the strong man. Yes, I remember. We went to see his show when we were kids. Little kids. - He gave me the iron amulet. It should have been mine, I was the oldest. You were older, but it was mine. - No, it was mine. Okay, it was yours, but you're the big brother, right? You must give it to the younger one. I still have his picture. - Do you still have it? I keep it in a secret place. - Why? Because it's a keepsake. His autographed picture. Jesus. This must have been at least 20 years ago. Arthur Robin. Mister Universe. Black Hercules. The black man. Jesus. Look at those legs and arms. His arms are like mine, more or less. - Exactly the same. Why are you looking for him? Give it to me before you ruin it. Because my iron amulet is gone. It's been stolen. You let someone steal it from you? Congratulations. It's been stolen. I know where his wife is. - His wife? Where? In Varallo Pombia, I think. It's near Milan. Up there? Are you sure? - Yes. I know his wife works in a park. - His wife? And he? - I don't know if he's still alive. Stay, easy, come here. Funky! Stop. Easy... Go, go... Susi, no, you're dirtying me. I'm going to see my sister-in-law and I even have to work. Boss, where put, boss? Is wheelbarrow there? Boss?! What's that pig doing? She's making her bed. Very smart. It's not even big enough for her. Some coffee? Yes, please. Who are you calling? - Tairo. He's not answering. - How come? I dunno. Last time I talked to him was some days ago. He went to see Arthur Robin. Oh, Arthur Robin... - Do you know him? Of course I do. - How do you know him? We worked together for Nando Orfei for 5 or 6 years, more or less. He was something. Just think, he was the first black Mr Universe. Really? When was that? When I was born, in 1957. That was a great turning-point. - Yes. He was some character. He was so strong, when he entered the circus arena, he'd break the chains. He'd put an iron on his throat and bend it, and the last number he did was with a rope. His wife was in the middle, she was really beautiful. He was at one end, and 10 people at the other. And made them fall to the floor in one second. - The strength of 10 men. Just think, one hand for 10 men. He was really strong... - Are you still in contact with him? No, I haven't seen him since then. We went our separate ways, and haven't met since. But I've heard that his son is somewhere here in the area. He's got a son? - Yes. Where is he? - I've been told he's with the Montemagno circus. I must go and see him. If it's him, it would be great. The last time I saw him he was a child. To see him as a man is wonderful. I hope to see him. Are you looking at my fish? - Yes, one looks like me. Which one? - The tiny red one. I'll call it Wendy, like you. Son of a... What are you doing, idiot! What the heck... Jackass. Are you looking for something? Are you looking for someone? No. I'm looking for Arthur Robin. Arthur Robin? - Yes. That's me. It's a great honor to meet you. - For me too. It's a great pleasure. - What's your name? Tairo. Sorry, Tairo. It's a pleasure to meet you. - No, it's a great pleasure for me. Mr Robin, exactly 15 years ago... you bent an iron during your show and gave it to me. You were one of the lucky ones. You were much younger. - Yes. I was 5 years old. A child, 5 years old. I'm sure it brought you luck. Yes, until now it's brought me luck. Now you're grown-up and understand a little bit the value... of the iron I gave you. - But I've lost it. Oh, that's a pity. - Someone's taken it, stolen it, made a bad joke. Stolen? - Yes. And I was hoping that Arthur Robin could bend me another one. Unfortunately, time passes even for me. The doctor told me, I can't take the strain... of bending iron like I did before. So I must listen to what the doctor said. That's right. - Because if something happens to me, and I go back to him, he'll say: it's your fault. I warned you. I could still bend iron, but softer iron. But I don't like faking. I'd like to do it for real. - The original, yes. And you see me bending it. But I'm sorry... That's something I can't do anymore. - No chance? No. This is my home. This is your home? - This is where I live. Nice. May I? - Please, after you. Thank you. I'll show you around. Lilly. Nice to meet you. Come in. - It's a pleasure. What a surprise! Where do you come from? From Rome, or even farther down. - And why are you here? I was looking for Mr Arthur Robin. He's come a long way just to come and see me. Really? Then you must be a fan of Arthur Robin. - Yes, indeed. A huge fan. That's nice. Have a seat, I'm cooking. Would you like some coffee? It's okay. I'm fine. - Take off your jacket. Don't be embarrassed. It's aunt Lilly. I don't want to be a nuisance. - She's glad to make you some coffee. I did the dish number, I was a ballet dancer. Then I was Arthur's partner, when he bent iron. This was our famous youth. The guy from the A-Team. Almost identical. - Yes. When did you meet Mr Arthur? I met him... in 1967, in Austria. In Austria? - Yes. He was doing a famous tour in Austria... with the Althoff circus, and I went to see the show. After two months I left home, and I followed him. After two months? - Love at first sight! It's also luck. I was extremelylucky. Because, as you see, we're still happy. You're a happy couple. Very happy. The trophy. - This is the Mr Universe trophy? Yes. Mr Universe. - That was in London. London, England. - Your victory, what a satisfaction. It was incredible. When you pass the first selection they make, you step on the podium, and you hear someone say: Arthur Robin. And you feel relieved... from all the sacrifices you've made to get to this point. I have a personal question: How old are you, more or less, because if that was 1957, what is your age now? If I tell you now, maybe you won't believe me. Why? - Because I'm already... 87 years old. 87?! No, I don't believe you. - And in 2 months... 88. 88! More than half a century. Imagine how many weights I lifted in all those years. How many pieces of iron he bent. You could have built a house. - A castle. Tons, and tons of iron. Excuse me, but this is mine. No, you're mistaken. It's identical. - You know, Arthur has bent iron his entire life. He gave those iron charms to people, to children, and never one to me. When he had his surgery in 1998, after his operation he took one year off... he began his training again, and the first iron, I said, "this one is for me". And that's it. - Would you... No, I can't give it to you. - But it's identical to mine. Of course, Arthur bent it. For me it's very precious, I kiss it. - Why? When I have a problem, a wish, I kiss it, and hold it very tight. It's very important to me. It gives me strength. Like five years ago, when I had to go to hospital. I said, I won't take anything else with me... - No rosary... I took the iron charm with me. I kissed it every night, put it under my pillow and thought: he put a lot of strength in it to bend it and I take out the strength to get well. This was my thought. A kiss in the evening and under my pillow. The nurses laughed at me, but then they changed their mind, because my belief... made me get well. I don't know if it's a coincidence. I'll put it away. - It's better to lock it away. Lock it? - Yes, or tonight -who knows... Come on, Tairo... - Thank you. Why do you put on that belt? - I put it on because I'm used to it. Every time I workout, I put on my belt. It gives good support to my back and prevents injuries. If you don't use the belt as support, you never know, you could hurt your spine. I didn't know that. There are things you need to learn. I must learn everything. I don't know anything about weights. How many kilos are these? That's... 40, no 50 kilos. Of course it's not like the old days... When I was in good shape and did serious weight lifting, training for Mr Universe, I lifted 150 kg. 150! - Yes. Series of 10 repetitions. Jesus! You know how that is. But you feel great. How did you get into this sport? - When I was a kid, I had this fixed idea to train... to become a champion. A champion. This was the fixed idea. Exactly. And that's whyl got into it. Breath out, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, last one, ten, fantastic! Great. Breathe in, deeply. I felt the muscles. I felt them. Can you feel it? I feel the muscles waking up. They were hibernating, like a bear... They're waking up. They're waking up slowly. It takes some time... People think... when they begin to train, they immediately get big muscles. But that's not true. You must suffer first. Lately my training has been eating and sleeping. Sandwich, Fanta... You're not the first. There are manylike that. And there you just connect the boiler. I must remove this. We can remove this. I need pliers. I need pliers, it's too tight. That should be perfect. Thank you. Do you have any Teflon? Maybe with that you'll have water in your caravan again. In two minutes I'll tell you if you'll have water. I've opened a little bit. Perfect. Open all the way. - All the way? All the way! - Like that? Perfect. It's not leaking. It's working fine! It's a dream. The boiler needs some time to heat. You've earned a big hug. Half a hug is okay, too. Let me hug you. God sent you. Don't mention it. Hi, can I help you? - I'm Wendy Weber. I'm looking for Enrico Robin. Oh, my husband. Knock at that door, he's working out. Thank you... - Bye. Hello. Are you Enrico? - Yes. My name is Wendy. I'd like to ask you some questions. Please, come in. Thank you. No, my father stopped working many years ago. He doesn't bend iron anymore. Many people have come and asked him, if he could... bend an iron, as a lucky charm, but my father said no. But to me that good luck charm would mean so much. An iron as a good luck charm? - Yes. Seeing that it's very important for you to have one, if you want I could bend one for you. As I told you, I've come back to work... at the circus a month ago, and I've started with my father's number. To keep the tradition alive. I don't want it to be forgotten. If it's not a problem, yes, please. No, just let me finish two series, and then we'll go and get an iron... and I'll bend it for you, okay? How much do you press on the bench? On the bench... I do series with 160 kg. And your father? - My father was a colossus. He did series with 240 kg! He was a real force of nature. As the saying goes: sooner or later I'll make it, too. Sooner or later I'll make it, too. See, Wendy, this is my father's box. It's almost 50 years old. My father gave it to me and said: "Take it. May it bring you good luck, as it did for me." Look, this is the iron I could bend... and give you as a lucky charm. Let me see, I think I still have iron bars that belonged to my father. Here, see? These are the iron bars... my father used, the ones he bent. Will you ever bend them? - No, these are my father's. They are his keepsakes and amulets. It's really tough... to do these exercises. Did it seem easier? - Much easier, because my father did it with such little effort... that it didn't look hard. Is this what you were looking for? It's like Tairo's, the one your father made. Yes, exactly the same. Everything will be fine now. I'm sure it will. I'm sorry, that's only iron dust. Justin, please use this song today. How? - Take it. Put it in the CD player. I know, but you know that everything is planned. I want to do my show with this song. Wendy, which number? - Number one. Welcome back! - Hi gran...
