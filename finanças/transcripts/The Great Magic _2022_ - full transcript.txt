GREAT MAGIC How tedious! Luckily it's fine. Yes, it's a lovely day. Isn't your husband coming? No, too busy at work. Mine isn’t coming either. Fortunately. Really? The sea air gives him asthma. It does? Look who’s coming. She looks like she's been condemned to death! She looks like a lifer. I heard he locked her up in her room. Hello! Let me show you. It’s this way. Come along! Stop... I'm going to be sick. Why? Because... - It's fresh. - I don’t want it. - Please! - It’s no use. - Take it. - No. - If you eat the right things... - It's nothing to do with that. That's what the doctor told me. This is it. Thank you. Hello. Can you help us unload? In the village where I was born, there was a little girl... ...who had a heart-defect like you. Do you know what happened to her? She's dead. She died from making too much effort. - Poor thing. - She's dead.... ...from doing the most natural thing there is. From breathing? The most natural thing in the world... ...that we all do. In the morning... Or not always in the morning. I know what you mean. You can’t strain yourself at all. And then we catch our breath. Like this. I breathe in... I blow bubbles in the water. And I hum a little music. Now it’s your turn. I'm flying... Like a bird. Here comes the tyrant. - Why don’t they split up? - That could happen. Come and join us. Sit down. Thank you. Sit down. You always snub us. I don't snub anyone, unless they're unpleasant. Oh! you’re in a bad mood. I am? Who told you that? On the contrary, I am very happy. Then sit down with us. I am happy, because I have no illusions. Bread is bread. Wine is wine. And sea-water is salty and bitter. - Why do you say that? - Because it's the truth. Yes, but what do you mean by it? I mean that... I expect no surprises from life. And I don’t trust anyone... including myself. Not even with women? - Especially with women. - You're being ridiculous. It doesn’t matter... we're not offended. Good! We’ll go up to our room now. - Come on. - You go... I’ll join you later. You’re not coming up now? No, I’ll stay for a little while. Then I’ll stay for a bit, too. Why not? What can I get you, Sir? - Lots of champagne! - Your room number? - Waiter...! - Yes? - What’s happening tonight? - There's to be a magic show. - I love magicians. - You do? I wasn’t expecting your approval. Pistachios! - Magic... Just the word makes me... - What? Horrified. You make me laugh. Excuse me, sir? I make you laugh? You’ll see... The Professor is extraordinary. Everything is fake... phoney. Is he really good? Extraordinary. I had a terrific time. I didn’t believe in it either. But I changed my mind. My daughter fainted. Yes, I fainted. - Because of that? - Yes. We were in the audience, my daughter, my son and me. We saw his show. - Where was that, honey? - In Venice, I think. Yes, Venice. He turned our father into a deer. A stag? Tell them, Dad. Yes I was a deer... I say that sincerely. Ask them.. Ask them if I’m lying Yes I became a deer... A beautiful male deer... With a very proud snout... a bit thick, it seemed. I was told I was running and jumping from side to side... and rearing superbly... ...in an extraordinary way. My feet were hitting the ground with force and majesty... Lightning, rumbling thunder... I was the ultimate deer! Yet I was there... ...sitting, doing nothing. Not at all conscious of being such a beautiful deer. I didn’t understand why everyone ...looked at me like that... goggle-eyed! I am just an ordinary man. Suddenly I was a freak. Bewildered people were screaming while pointing fingers at me. Look at him as he jumps... He is full of majesty. Oh see how he jumps! The ultimate deer. And when all in chorus they shouted Horns! He has horns! I tapped my head to check... I was still the same person. And when everyone in the chorus shouted Horns! He has horns!! He tapped his tousled head... He was not the same person. I didn’t feel anything new... I was always there in my own skin And when everyone in the chorus shouted Horns! He has horns! He tapped his tousled head... He was not the same person. But don’t laugh... I would've loved to jump, gallop... And night is coming... from the bottom of my soul Feeling in me... Yes from the bottom of my soul Feeling in me Mount... Mount... Mount... Mount in your rutting... Grotesque. The rutting The rutting The rutting The rutting Professor! This way, Professor. It’s beautiful. It’s a lovely place. The sea is sublime. Really? The sea is sublime? Poor fool! Poor idiot! It’s a drop of water, you idiot, in the darkness. The darkness is there, even when you think the sun is shining. Yes, ladies and gentlemen! In the sun, I see darkness. So, who rides your horses? The groom, of course. Zaira’s not here yet? No. Did you two fight again? She’s an impossible woman. I can’t stand her anymore. Make peace with her... Life's hard enough as it is. Life is hard enough as it is. Who've we got? Well... Miss Locace. Mrs Leloup.... Mouthwash of Mr Bismuth. Mrs Moufflet... We only found this picture. The book. Her book? The gastric bandage of Mr Moufflet. This is a book. That’ll do. How you have changed, the man I loved You can burn the negatives all you want It’s not like you know we'll restart the fire again Maybe you love me in your own way To lead the war... for fear of losing But this anger makes you ugly, Charles Yes this anger makes you ugly, Charles I have no desire... I’m empty of joy I don’t even know why... I wear makeup, or dress. I live next door, next door. I hide from you. Farewell to summer mornings They are in the tomb of time... Thrown away among the things that once have been... ...and will no longer be. Will you be ready soon? Who is this man behind the door? I don’t know him. Can't he leave me alone! I urge him to keep going. Who is this woman behind the door? I no longer recognize her. Her will is so strong... It amounts to refusal. I keep watching for a speck of tenderness in her eyes. I don’t see it anymore. But I keep watching for love to be reborn... It’s probably now too late. Looking at her, it seems there's nothing left... Nothing left, at all. It seems... ...there’s nothing left... Like ivy to its oak... Like grief to the heart... Like ankles are the chains I'm forever your link Like ivy to its oak... Like love at its end... Like ankles to their chains... You cling to me... I hold on to you - You cling to me... - I hold on to you. I hold on to you, Marta - You cling... - I hold on to you - You cling to me - Like the link, like a leash As at the ankles are the chains, I hold on to you, Marta I cling to you I hold on to you, Marta Marta, I am the link... Forever your link... Like ivy, like chains Like ivy, like leaves You cling to me I cling to you... Marta You cling to me Marta Sir? Sorry. Thank you. In the darkness, you could destroy them with the third eye... If you could get it. The third eye. The eye without a window. The eye of thought. The only one I have left. The other two, the visible eyes... those that, in my youth, saw the world... the great, surprising, wondrous world... I lost them forever. Is he blind? No, ma'am. I’m not blind. But you... you are blind to the incredible... ...since you are part of this great mass of blind people... ...who can never possess the third eye. I can’t see very far with my third eye. I fail to give more than small illusions. What would you say Sir, to being turned into a chatty parrot? Why me? It's not... It never is... too late. - Do you know me? - Me? Do I know you? I know all about you About you... And all the rest of you. Here, there, everywhere... I know all about everyone. I approach, look at you and think... Who are you, Mrs Leloup? Then my third eye awakes... And I see all in my consciousness... Everything down to that which sleeps. Behind appearances Mrs Locace I see that your aunt's in Capri. Oh! The South in summer... How lovely it would've been... ...if their baggage hadn't been stolen. Ah, here! Marta you're reading... ...a strange and sublime novel. The plot takes time to emerge. Has the hero ever jumped through the window? I know all about you. I know you like the back of my hand. On your foreheads, I clearly read your souls. I touch on the mystery, the secret of your tears. That of your pride... with my third eye. We’re going to have a lot of fun tonight... That I promise. Please believe me, the show will be... ...full of surprises Who will turn into a donkey? Who into an Alezan thoroughbred? Into a queen or peasant? Will you do me the honour to be present? We’re going to have a lot of fun tonight. That I promise. Listen to me, God. Because you think you’re God. Leave me alone again with the costumes, and I’m leaving. I’m sick of it. I’m tired of this life. Find yourself a proper contract, in a real theater. I could get a good deal... ...if I had a partner who was young and beautiful. Everyone thinks I’m young and beautiful. Made up and dressed in my stage costume, I’m worth 100 pretty 18-year-olds. I see you with my third eye. And I’ll kill them for you. All three. You’re a pain. Oh! I don’t know why I stay with you. Because I know you. Okay... here. Do you want to sit here? How close are we? Ladies and gentlemen... Be aware that my numbers are not always successful. To exercise my power... - Modest. - ...I need you. I can only suggest to you if you agree to accept a suggestion. I can only convey my thought to you... ...if you are ready to receive it. Bravo! If you don’t mind... A bit of silence. In this silence... I will transmit the music on your mind. You hear? We work better in music. Now we can begin. From Islamabad, Zaira! If a kind lady would like to experience... No, thank you. You? Go ahead. No. Me, no. A brave lady? No, thank you. What about you? Me? If you like. My compliments, dear lady... ...for your beauty and your courage. Examine the coffin carefully... It's genuine. Check it out. Would you be so kind as to enter? Wait a second, dear lady! Listen. When I close the coffin, you will disappear. You will be attracted into a world of dreams. You will feel a sensation of absolute well-being. Your soul will depart from your body. And your body will disintegrate... ...right after your soul has left it. - I didn’t quite understand. - Enter now. It’s transmigration of the soul, like with the Egyptians. Zaira! Zaira! Ladies and gentlemen, a little patience. You know what women are like... Always late. Not very gallant. Dear audience! Stay focused. I’ll be right back. - It’s not my fault. - You're fired! Listen! If you send me back, you’re not see me again. You come here. No! Come on. - Come here. - No! Ladies and gentlemen... we always know how an experiment begins... but not always how it ends. Let’s move on now to another experiment. Look, ladies and gentlemen... ...this poor little prisoner. How happy he is, poor little canary. Who can catch you if you escape? There’s simply no way! You can disappear for a few minutes, but then... You have to come back! Zaira! Oh no... Bravo! Excuse me, Sir... Would you be kind enough to bring my wife back? Forgive me, but who are you? Who am I? I’m her husband. Be kind enough to bring my wife back. Yes, a little patience. Here we go.... - Zaira! - Wait. Wait a minute, please. Before you move on... ...will you be kind enough to bring my wife back? I don’t understand. It is simple. Please be kind enough to bring my wife back. Sir, are you conducting these experiments, or am I? You, of course... but I demand my wife’s return. Extraordinary. You're convinced that your wife is missing? Open the coffin. Are you naive enough to believe... that a coffin has the power to make people disappear? It does not occur to you that maybe it was you... ...who made her disappear? Open the coffin! Unwittingly, I give you that, in good faith. This is absurd. I didn’t do anything. You really are convinced that your wife is missing? Yes, you made her disappear. Before that she was here, sitting next to me. She wasn’t there... ...sitting next to you. Don’t say that, even as a joke. Your wife, who knows... ...when she disappeared? You’re all alone here. We never saw her. Have we seen the gentleman’s wife? No! No, No, No! No! You made your wife disappear... You have to make her reappear. You’re the master of the game. Would you be so good as to come close to me? I’m not a clown. - You want to lose her forever? - Shut up! A little courage, Sir! Come on! Are you a jealous husband? It’s none of your business, or anyone else's! Just answer the question. - Are you a jealous husband? - Well, yes, I am. A little bit. Did you hear that? The man's jealous. Do you make a scene for her? Don’t get all worked up... Answer me calmly. Have you ever doubted her? Of her goodness, of her sincerity, of her faithfulness? You offend me. I don’t want to offend anyone. I want to help you. Have you ever doubted her? Never. Never! Perfect. Then listen to me. Is your wife missing? Yes. Take mine. Always smiling, in a good mood, happy. Every morning, God willing. Robust and inexpensive. No! Sir, I’ll tell you the truth. Here. Your wife is in this box. Watch out! - You don’t believe me? - No. Then open it. I’m opening it. Watch out! Are you sure your wife's in this box? I'm sure she's not. If you believe she is... you'll find her in the box. If you don't believe it... ...don't open it. Open it! If you please! He must decide on his own. It's his responsibility alone. So? Of course I believe she's there. Excellent. What are you waiting for? Open it. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for us to leave you. But we won't leave before we offer you a final number. ACT 2 - THE ABSENCE Proceed slowly... Looking everywhere. If you find a clue... cigarette butts, footprints, traces of blood, urine, or faeces... Don’t touch anything. Report it right away. Use all your senses. Don’t forget your smell. Ready, set... Three, two, one... go! Traces of blood? It’s a little handkerchief, I think. Embroidered. Well? That doesn’t mean... No, nothing. How much for the damage? For the bad publicity? I could demand damages! We too... for defective customers. You’re camping on my land for free, you make my clientele disappear... ...and you expect me to pay you? Bravo! Evaporate in the gardens of the Metropolis! Thank you. - Long live the artists. - That’s what I’m proposing. Pay us for yesterday and we play again tonight for free. I’d rather see my hotel burned down. You can’t say that... It’s anger that makes you talk. Don’t burn down a building like this. I’d like to work in peace, thank you. What are you doing? I’m perfecting my generation of wild applause. The audience responds... Unless you blew it. My God! What a moron! You're so irresponsible. What’s going on? Come out of there! Get out of here. He thinks it's applause-generation. He’s forgetting about the lack of money. Something will turn up. Something will turn up, and save us? The hotelier will turn up... armed! At the end of the month, it will be like this... He will pay the rent. This has been the case since he was born. When he needs shoes... Believe me, I swear... He will hypnotize the cobbler Knock, knock... Yes, who is there? I am the cobbler. Welcome my dear friend! Here are your shoes, polished. Thank you, cobbler... How much do I owe you? Nothing at all... Free for you, my friend. Be careful, Zaira! You are a great magician... Yes, he is a huge magician! Our hero! Our guardian angel. Showering upon us... ...all the comforts of life. My purse is so empty, I could cry. Oh! - Why worry? - I know a wizard from hell. Someday I shall do it too. What? I will disappear... Yes, I will disappear forever. Zaira, my bluebird... Wait a minute. I am a magnificent magician! Once again, I will go like this... And guess what, my love? You will reappear... ...in a better mood. Nobody move! Don’t let anyone move. - I'm alone. - Don’t be smart. Hands up, don’t move. In the name of the law, open up. These words give me authority. Understand? You stay close to me. To what do I owe the honour of your visit? I shan't answer that. Okay. Detective, what can I do for you? My friend, don’t play the timid dove. The police are well-informed. Saturday night, in the garden of the Metropolis... ...your criminal practice has led to his wife's disappeared. - But... - Silence! Hold it right there. His wife wore jewellery of gold and stones. - And an emerald. - Silence! In gold and stones, we include emeralds. So, she was abducted and done away with. What have you done with the body? It’s better for you... Don’t waste police-time... Get your wife back. I’m not opening that box. I'm not stupid. What box? He says my wife’s inside. Are you kidding me? Why and how did you murder her? Where is her body? I’ll tell you everything. Can he be further away? You, get over there. Over there. Over there! Over there! - Dead? - Alive. Remarkably alive. She just ran away. Ran away? Yes. Certainly. And to spare her unfortunate husband... ...the humiliating reality... ...I made up this whole box thing. Ridiculous! What if he opens it? He will think he has lacked confidence. What if he doesn’t open it? He’ll live with the illusion of his faithfulness. I didn’t quite understand. That doesn’t matter. Poor guy. If I were you, I’d arrest him. On what charge? Slander. There was no slander. To me, there was. Why don’t you tell him the truth? He asks for a report of adultery. I surprise them. All done. You tell him yourself. Why? How does that make me feel? What about me? It’s none of my business. - Me neither. - Really! What's going on? What do we do? - What’s going on? - Shut up. Don’t bring her back. And thank the Professor. You slandered him and I could arrest you for making fun of an officer. - Me? - Yes, you. You! You don't talk nonsense, especially to the police. We need facts, proof. If your wife was murdered, show me the corpse. However, if your wife ran away with her lover, say... You need to tell me where she is. I’ll go and arrest them. Do you know where she is? - No. - No? So, what can I do? Dirty laundry is washed at home. Goodbye, Professor. I think I got it. If she’s not dead... maybe she’s gone off... with someone else? Someone else? Who? But then I’m the one who died. No! You're quite alive, I promise you. And your wife’s in the box. Feel free to come back. I’m right here. If I make my lashes black And my eyes more light And my lips more scarlet Asking every mirror If everything is as I want Not vanity! I seek The face that was mine Before there was a world. Why be cruel to me? Why do you think you are being betrayed? I want in loving what was Before there was a world Before there was a world And it doesn’t matter if I look at a man As if he were my love When yet my blood remained cold My heart is not beating faster Why be cruel to me? Why do you think you’re being betrayed? I want in loving what was Before there was a world Before there was a world You’re preoccupied, my little bird. Yes. By what? It starts with an L. I see a young man. A sensitive, brave young man. He has deep eyes, dark hair. Is he alone? Very lonely, maybe an orphan. No. I mean, is he engaged? No. He only thinks about his work. He gives himself entirely to his job. He hasn’t found love yet. But then... - But then what? - Wait. He's very shy. With a sickly shyness. So I’ll have to take the first step? - I’ll never dare. - You’ll have to. You think if I declare myself, he'll want me? It's quite likely... ...the possibility of a great love affair. I say possibility... - I’m not saying certainty. - Yes. You have to take the first step very quickly. Sorry, Mr Moufflet. We’re closing. I’ll just have one last whiskey for the road. Are you leaving? I’m leaving, we’re leaving, you’re leaving. Allow me, Sir, to express my sincere regrets for the strange situation in which you find yourself. And I hope that you’ll be back next year. With your wife. I’ll have to tell you Young man What are my favorite flowers Tell me, yes tell me about your favourite flowers These are carnations Small carnations Light pink carnations As a child, I live near an oat field On a country road A coachman who stopped To feed his horse Eat, eat animal Eat, said his master Swallow this nice bunch of grass Take this bunch That’s when I saw it Alone in the grass The carnation trapped in the grass Choked by the grass The pale pink carnation The little carnation That the horse... Swallowed Sir! Just stop, please. Oh no! Oh no... You're back? You said to me: Feel free to come back. Here I am. I’ve decided to wait here with you. - Really? - Yes. Good! Want something to eat? I was getting ready to make nettle soup. I love it. Next to it. That’s it. What time do you usually eat? Around 8. So, around 7, 7.30, you get hungry. Yes. Sometimes earlier. It’s 7.30 because you’re hungry or are you hungry because it’s 7.30? - I don’t know. It’s the same, isn’t it? - No. It’s 7.30 because you’re hungry. The clock is inside you. Time is you. Time is a convention. Everything is convention. You think time goes by, but that’s not true. Time does not pass. How long ago did your wife disappear? Three weeks. You believe that? I know it. And if... ...I was still doing my trick? What if it only happened for a moment? We’re in the hotel garden. You’re watching my show. The feelings you feel, the images your eyes see... It's me who gives them to you. Look over there... I'm passing an image to your mind... the image of a man with a rifle. He looks like the hotel manager. Yes, so I see. I told you once, twice. Now it’s without me. - Don’t worry, I’m in control. - It's over! Now it’s all over! It’s all over now! Hello Mr Manager. You pay me or I’ll kill you! Mr Moufflet, you should go home instead of being with these crooks. Wait a minute! You see, that fellow is part of the show. - Is it a game? - Yes. It’s a game which can go two ways. If I give him his money, the show is successful. Otherwise, he shoots me. Then it just gets crazy. The police, the courts, the newspapers... prison, the cemetery... The action, the twists and turns, of the drama.... would make a great show! - Shoot him to see. - I’m not kidding you. Get away from me! Nothing’s going to happen. He won’t die, it’s a game. No, you don’t get it. If he shoots me, I die. It’s part of the game... I die... and my world ends. No one has the right to destroy a world. Your world and mine are connected. If mine is destroyed, yours will be too. This con man owes me 2,400 francs! And now, ladies and gentlemen, for this game... I need 2,400 francs. Who’s willing to give it to me? It’s rather urgent. Why? Because it’s better. I don’t have cash on me. Is a cheque okay? It’ll be fine. 2,400 francs. Here. Now go away. I’ll give you until tomorrow. Tomorrow! Did he shoot someone? No... He made a nice exit. What about my money? - What money? - My cheque. Ah! The image of a cheque? If you’d taken that cheque seriously, you wouldn’t have given it. But for our show, yes, you did it. The 2,400 francs will come back to you, one way or another. - When? - When? It doesn’t matter. There are games of illusion... lasting for thousands of conventional years... and are far from complete. Good evening, Professor. I’m looking for the girl who works with you. I’d like to talk to her. You can’t talk to her. She wanted to talk to me. You’ll never be able to talk to her. Why? Well, I don’t know. - I don’t understand. - Better that way. Now get out...! There’s nothing here for you. Go on... scram! The carnation trapped in the grass Choked by the grass The pale pink carnation... The little carnation... That the horse... swallowed Look... They see me... and they start singing... the idiots. The morons. They love me. I treat them every day. I give them grain. Lettuce. It’s a cuttlefish bone. And from time to time... know what I do? Shoot. Go ahead, shoot. Go on! Boom! He's disappeared. How did he do it? He is a magician. The moron. He hasn't disappeared. He's dead, crushed... ...between the bottom and the double bottom. The shot is used to conceal the click. Look what I find... And they don’t suspect anything. They can’t fool anyone. They've no imagination. We do. Come on, cheer up. Give me your hand. The cold air falls onto the garden of the Hotel Metropole. Look how calm the sea is tonight. Look how beautiful the sea is. I see a wall. Can’t you see the sea? Can’t you hear it? I wanted to live fast To make my life long I wanted to live slowly To retain time I did the best I could And even if the shadow has come to freeze my steps Don’t worry I have all my time All my time to love Now, all the time to love you all the time Now that love is born It can no longer turn off It’s burning me with joy And if love comes to you What will I do? Will I sing to your children Lullabies shortened by night Or will I run away? I have time Time to decide Now all the time Loving you all the time Now that love is born It can no longer turn off Love is my home Now that the sun has set I have time to love you for an eternity Now that love is born It can no longer turn off He’s burning me with joy He’s burning me with joy Love is my home It’s burning me with joy We think we’re leaving But we stay here Time does not pass I almost nearly caught the hook Swallowed the bait This is not the case It’s an illusion Time does not pass I am sure I am in the garden of the Hotel Metropole. You didn’t know You were lied to The show is not... really finished I wait for the drums I look forward to your... Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! I leave but I stay here It is not... It's an illusion Time does not pass Marta is in my arms Abracadabra! Time does not pass You think I’m alone and abandoned Widowed or divorced But Marta is there laughing with happiness Close to my heart You can't see it's an illusion Time does not pass Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! I am sure I’m in the garden Marta on my arm Robin! Robin! - Light, air...! - The boss doesn’t want to. - Say it’s me. - He drives me crazy. - You're paid to obey orders. - Paid, yes? By whom? He won’t give me my salary because the game isn’t over. - I’ll pay you. Don’t worry. - When? Come with me. The boss is getting worse. Why didn’t you tell me? It’s been four days he hasn’t eaten or drunk. Or drunk? Is that all? The boss owes me for two months. Here’s one for you. Robin is moving away. He says his hunger is an illusion, He’ll eat when the game’s over. He won’t even go to the loo. Really? Last night he was writhing in pain. He’s about to burst. He refused bread and sausage. I hide to eat. If not, he sends me back. I’ll talk to him... Make some spaghetti. - If I do that, he’ll kill me. - Don’t argue. Okay. But I'm no longer responsible. Good morning, Charles. Hello! Nothing to say? No. Why must I speak useless words and conventional sentences? I hate you. You see? I smile at you... and I hate you. And I resist. Yes, I decided to resist you. I don't go to the toilet anymore. Look, I’m getting old. I’ve turned grey. I've shrunk. And you’re telling me time doesn’t pass? I’ll kill you, you know. Hm! A beautiful dish of spaghetti. Let's go.... eat. It's 4 years since I ate. Hm! Spaghetti with fresh tomato. Are you saying I should let myself go? Like a beast. Whatever you feel... say it, do it. One day, I was at a friend’s funeral... And I wanted to sing 'Tosca'. Here, for example, I’m very hungry. And I really want to sing 'Tosca'. Sing if you want to sing. Sing. Put a plate on the spaghetti. I’ll be right back. I’m taking charge. How much further? - What are we waiting for? - I've sounded the alarm. She sounded the alarm. All you do is complain. We must declare war. I’ve been crying for 40 years My tear ducts are old gutters Where flows non-stop A torrent not new Mama, the disaster is total People gossip and make fun of us What are we waiting for to fight evil? This scammer burns his brain Strips, manipulates. He squanders our fortune Act now Mama, you can’t! Let me do it My reins take the lead! Trust me... Let me guide you Here’s what we’ll do First, Charles must divorce his whore of a wife, who defiles our name Second, have him committed for mental illness Third, give our mother the rest she deserves Isn’t that right, Mama? In a good retirement home. After appointing me guardian, with full powers And your sister? She married you. What a mistake! I still have the right to give my opinion So we've decided Yes, we've decided It’s up to our mother to decide Eh, Mama! I’ve been crying for 40 years My tear ducts are old gutters Where flows non-stop A torrent not new Decent rest in a good home Intern for mental illness Full Powers! Full Powers! Divorce your whore of a wife! No, this way, this way. Robin! Yeah, boss. Robin? Sir? - You're an idiot. - Why? I meant it, I said it. Say it, Sir, if it makes you feel good. Oh! Hello dear parents Dear Mother Dear brother and sister Dear brother-in-law Hello Come in Come in What a joy to see you! You never change. You're all images. My mother. My afflicted mother. My jealous brother. My litigious sister. My greedy brother-in-law. You're all perfect! Bravo! You've been like this for 4 years. Four conventional years. Brother, I owe you the truth... Your wife... You can't forbid me anything. I see your game. You want my money. - Think so? - Yes. I used to control myself, keep my mouth shut. - Have you always deceived us? - Yes. Listen to the truth. Your wife ran off. She ditched you. She took lovers... was humped by all and sundry. And you’re waiting for her like an idiot. Before that, she was cheating on you. Isn’t that right? Very true. Isn’t that right, Mama? I’ve been crying for 40 years. Do you think so? Centuries ago! You’re part of a crying game. A game other than mine. Your essence is crying. I’ll walk you home. Come on! It’s convenient for you now. It’s strange, not telling me earlier... ...that she was cheating on me. You should've told me while she was still here. Come on! Get out! He’s ready for the asylum, Mama. - Buffoon! - Oh, I thought so. You're quite sick. Professor! Professor! I’m right here. - Do these images interest you? - No. Why? If they're not needed, experiment. Make them disappear. I want a quiet lunch. There you are. You think he’s normal? Why not? He's not mad? - Not crazy at all. - Yes, he's crazy. - You’d like that. - What? I say he’s not crazy. And you insist he is. I think you’d like that. You’re working on his madness to strip him. But it won’t last. - I've started proceedings. - Oh? I have the evidence. In a week I'm his guardian. What a wonderful brother you are. Watch what you do. In a week, I’ll kick you out of this house. Robin! I’d like a picture of cheese. Actually, Sir, there's none left. I ate it this morning, so as to be part of the game. You did right. - Not even a feeling? - No. Not even a snapshot. Well, make the impression of bringing some wine. Wine. Yes, wine. Oh no! No wine. Last night, I gave the impression of drinking the last two bottles. The impression was so strong... ...that I was as drunk as a lord. Well, what's left? Uh... nothing, Sir. The image of an empty pantry. Well, imagine you’re going to the market and buy images of food and wine. Right away, Boss. But I have to believe too that I take the money in the picture of your drawer. Because at the market, without an image of silver, they won't play the game. Ask the Professor for an image of the key to my desk. Did you like the spaghetti image? Excellent. Develop it well. Robin! Yes, boss. A moron. No need. We're flush now. Enjoy it. I'm not enjoying myself. I’d like to leave. Go if you want. I’m not stopping you. It'll be funny when I get my hair back. It’s enough to drive you crazy. I have wrinkles, hanging skin. A scrawny neck. Soon I’ll be toothless. At least one is loose. I swear it’s really loose. The illusion is perfect. And my eyesight's failing. My back aches. And when I see death... Will I be scared? No. Afraid of what? Of the end of a game? What a good joke! My little Marta. My love. Can you hear me? Oh, my sweetie! Sorry. I’m the one who locked you up in this box. I had become unbearable, selfish... ...indifferent. I'd become a husband. I remember the day you put this dress on for the first time. You were so happy. You looked at me to see my joy. And I... I tried not to look at you... ...to not tell you I liked it. I should've said, "You’re so beautiful." "You're even more beautiful." I like you so much. Little by little, coldness has crept between us. I didn't talk. Neither did you. I made no tender gesture. We were no longer lovers. You no longer made a tender gesture We were no longer lovers I couldn’t take it anymore... to wait for nothing I ran away I thought this is the day my life begins Today, as my life begins I wanted it to be brand new I wanted to be naked But my new life never started There was no clear dawn And in this fog your voice came back to me Your presence was attached to my steps My thoughts of you returned Because maybe you loved me Yes, perhaps you loved me Is that you, sir? Albert! That’s her. She came back. We'd given up believing. You took your time. We didn’t think that you'd return. Watch out, Marta! Watch out, Marta! Watch out, Marta!! Watch out, Marta! Watch out, Marta!! Watch out, Marta! I’ll open the door. How I love you! I’ll be young again, like a moment ago. With all my black hair. One... two... And three! That’s it for now. Marta? Marta... Yes. I’m right here. I came back. The game is over. It’s over. Done. So now...? - Are we done? - Yes! Then why aren't I in the hotel garden? Because you passed out. We brought you home. What about my hair? You lost them because of the shock. - In a moment? - In an instant. I've missed you. But that was a moment ago. The game was awful for you too. It’s not a game. This is the time. Leave us alone. Your face has changed. - I've aged. - I recognize your voice. Your face has changed. I don’t know exactly how. Four years have passed. No. No. There's never been a single day without me thinking about you. I realised I missed you... and that we'd not truly known each other. And it didn’t matter to me to be known by someone other than you. I wanted to... I'd like... ...that you should know me. We had too much self-esteem. Too much stubbornness, too. I felt misunderstood. I needed the freedom. So, yes, yes... There were other men. - But none of them mattered. - Who is this woman? Let’s get out of this madness that we lived in. I don’t understand her words. - The madness you’re in! - Who is this woman? Charles. stop. Who is this woman? She's your wife. That’s not true. Only I can bring back my wife. You said it. You missed your turn. You made a mistake. You came in a just moment before I opened the box. Too bad! - The box is empty. - No! Inside is what I believe. You don’t know what I believe! I don’t know this woman. Maybe she’s playing a game that doesn’t concern me. So tell her to go back, to leave again. There is no game. Stop talking about a game. It is humiliating. That woman is not my wife! Remove this pathetic image of a returning wife. - I brought her back to you. - No! You think you did. You think you’re here, but you’re not. I'm the one who transmitted these images to your brain. She, she appears like a common adulteress! But in reality, she does not exist! And you don’t exist either. She’s just an image, and so are you. The magician is me. Robin! Sir? These images must disappear. Do the illusion of opening the door. Believe strongly that you see them going out. When you’re quite sure, close the door. - Slam it! - But Sir... Go! Slam it, I said! Slam it! Don’t look inside it. Keep it with you, tightly closed. And maybe you’ll find the treasure... ...if you keep it with you, shut tight... ...forever. - Know what we’re afraid of? - No. Not to be watched again. We’ve been made to believe... ...that a woman must always be watched. Otherwise, what? We don’t exist anymore? Maybe. But life is here. There. There. Right? Isn’t that right? And then, one day, it’ll come back. At a time you least expect it, it will come... A brand-new love that will be like no other. And your heart will start to beat like you’re 15 years old. Come on! We're on our way. Bad days' companions... I bid you goodnight Good night Now I'm going... the formula was wrong It's all my fault again Everything was down to me So I'm going... I should have listened to you I should have played the lap-dog It's music that appeals but I only played it my way and then I got upset Bad days' companions Think of me sometimes later when you're awake Think of the one who plays the seal and eats smoked salmon by the sea Bad days Bad days Bad days Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight and I'm going The formula was wrong. When playing the wire-haired dog... keep your bow then I'll leave. People don't come to the concert to hear death screaming and this dog-pound song upset us the most Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight Sweet dreams! I'll take my cap and 2 or 3 cigarettes in the package and go I'm going Bad Days Companions Think of me sometimes later when you're awake. Think of the player the seal and the smoked salmon By the sea By the sea Bad days Bad days Bad days Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight Sleep! Dream! Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight Bad days' companions I bid you goodnight Good night! Bad days' companions Have a good night Sweet dreams! And I’m going I wanted to live fast To make my life long I wanted to live slowly To retain time I did the best I could And even if the shadow has come to freeze my steps Don’t worry I have plenty of time All my time to love Now, all the time Love you all the time Now that love is born it can no longer turn off It’s burning me with joy And if love comes to you What will I do? Will I sing to your children Lullabies shortened by night Or will I run away? I have time Time to decide Now all the time Love you all the time Now that love is born It can no longer turn off Love is my home Now that the sun is set I have time to love you for eternity Now that love is born It can no longer turn off He’s burning me with joy He’s burning me with joy Love is my home Love is my home Now the sun is set I have time All the time, all the time Time All my time All my time To love you Love is my home Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
