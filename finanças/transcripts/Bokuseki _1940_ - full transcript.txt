Hurry. Your guests are waiting. Your guide's arrived, sir. - Sorry for keeping you waiting. - Thank you. We want to cross Karamatstu now. Will you guide us? Sure I will, sir. The weather is no problem, I hope? No problem, sir. Will you stay at the Kurobishigoya hut tonight, sir? We are planning to. That's good. Sir, the hut repairs were just completed a couple of days ago. That's fortunate. How about your luggage, sir? This bigger one. Do you need something? If so you'd better to get it here now. Well, then, straw sandals and matches. Give us straw sandals and matches. Now then, let's start. Have a cup of tea. Hey, Zen-san, around the Kurobishi hut, can I catch yamame fish? Well, that's up to your skill. - They say there are many fish. - Then, it's OK. Just see for yourself. I doubt it. Thank you for everything, master. Sorry we couldn't do enough, sir. Please come again on your way back. Thank you. Sensei, take care, sir. The weather's in our favour. Thanks to my usual good behaviour. Wait. I'll take photo. You can keep walking. The mountains are wonderful. If I hadn't pulled you out, you'd still be crawling around your old lab. Yes, and if you serve me yamame fish at the hut, I'll be grateful. Do you think you can really fish? You bet, I can. Hey, that's the master from the inn. Did I forget something? - Sensei, - What is it? - You have a phone call, sir. - Who? Futagiri sensei, sir. You got the call. Damn it all. Hold this. Wait a moment. Excuse me. If the hospital asks you back, don't go. The master called him sensei, I thought he was a teacher. - Is he a doctor? - Yes. Well now... Let's go back a little. Hello? I'm Futagiri. I see. No, it's OK. I understand. Sensei, something urgent? Who called you? - From the hospital. - What is it? They asked me back immediately. You refused, of course? No, I'll return. Return? Are you sure? Don't be silly. We've finally got here. What's the problem? A new patient was admitted with encephalitis. Is that all? You don't need to return. There are many other doctors in the hospital. But it can't be. I took over the study of encephalitis from the previous director. I am mainly in charge of it. So you are determined to return? I'm sorry. Hope you catch your yamame fish. Oji-san, call a taxi. So you are going back? Surgery... Medicine Open 09:00 - 15:00 Laboratory attached to hospital The Fifth Small Animal Room Jidai-kun, did you check the temperature of that guinea pig? - Not yet, sir. - Then check it now. Your handling isn't good. You can't do it if you are awkward. Disinfect it by boiling. Close this and start a new one. Fujimoto sensei. - Futagiri sensei has returned, sir. - I see. When you finish here, prepare to give glucose to a horse. The one we took plasma from this morning. What do you think of the horse? Well, I like beef better. - I've never eaten horse yet. - Silly. I didn't ask that. Listen, Futagiri sensei returned in his mountaineering gear. How does he look? - Very smart. - Let's have a look. No, Miss Oikawa. The Fifth Laboratory Futagiri Welcome back. I'm sorry for disturbing your holiday. It's OK. How about the patient? The patients in room 3 and 8 show no change but, a boy who was admitted to the isolation ward, seems to have encephalitis. Then we'll try the blood serum. However, the diagnosis is disputed. Why? Maybe I'd better start from the beginning. The isolation ward is full now. We are seriously short-handed. So Oikawa Hatsu-san of the laboratory came to support the ward. As she cared for the boy she suspect it might be encephalitis epidemica. - Didn't you try a simple culture system? - Sure we did. It was negative, but Oikawa-san still felt puzzled. So I extracted cerebrospinal fluid and applied it to 10 mice. Two mice showed symptoms. Hearing that, Sawamura-san in the isolation ward, became furious. Why? He said, "It is outrageous to do such a thing without consulting me." You didn't tell him? Then Sawamura-san's anger is reasonable in a way. Yes, it's true. But it wasn't such a big deal. It seems there was another reason. To begin with, he's narrow-minded, while Oikawa Hatsu is rather odd. That complicated matters. But he doesn't refuse the patient's treatment, does he? He does. He refused my treatment. That makes no sense. I couldn't leave it like that. That's why I called you. I see. I'll go and see. Suzuki-kun. Deliver my belongings to my apartment afterwards. Connect Sawamura-sensei in the isolation ward. Wait a moment, sir. Call Sawamura-sensei. Sensei, you have a call, sir. From Futagiri sensei in the laboratory. I'm busy now. Hello. Sawamura sensei has no time right now. Did you hear? The issue of encephalitis epidemica is still disputed. Heard the rumour? Sawamura sensei had gotten a rebuff from Oikawa Hatsu. Really? Yes. Since then the two have a conflict every now and then. Both of them are single. Both of them very old. Futagiri sensei. Has he come for an examination? Oikawa-kun. Welcome back, sir. I heard it from Fujimoto-kun. Why didn't you tell Sawamura sensei? Sawamura sensei looked very busy. I thought I could tell him later. I just wanted to examine the patient. But you came from the laboratory to help. It's not wise to meddle in the hospital's work. I'm sorry, sir. But I believe what I did was right for the patient. You may be right. But you must think of the order and position of things before acting. Yes, sir. Be careful from now on. Sensei, the round of visits, sir? Here, sir. I will see the rooms 3 and 8 later. I'll go the epidemic room. Come with me. The Second Epidemic Room Wait a moment, sir. Can I help you? I want to check the boy. Wait. Do you know the situation? Yes, I heard. About Oikawa-kun, isn't it? I warned her to be careful. It's easy for you to say, but I was very upset. Why? Just think. She did it without consulting me. It suggested that I have made a mistake. You are right, sir. But she has done it without any malicious intent. Malicious intent? That is too much. However, the woman always displays problematic features of an old maid. Her behaviour is always unpleasant. I think she must be adequately punished in this case. It might be needed. But the issue can be solved later. I think first priority is the patient who needs treatment. If it is encephalitis epidemica, it is my responsibility. I want you to wait until this issue is settled. Sawamura-san, you are senior. I'm sorry if it seems rude, but she is just a woman. Don't be emotional. Please consider the issue as a doctor before it is too late. Do you have the permission of the chief of internal medicine? Of course I do, sir. Let me check, sir. Please. My diagnosis is encephalitis epidemica. We will apply blood serum. Call Fujimoto-kun and prepare for it. Futagiri sensei. Are you still staying? I heard that the boy wouldn't survive. A pity. I am sorry indeed. It's not your fault. The hospital side is talking, but don't mind them. The laboratory has done its best. - Welcome, sir. - Ice cream. Laboratory? I am Izumi. Futagiri-san, please. Futagiri sensei is out, sir. Who is it? Izumi-san, sir. Izumi-san? I am Fujimoto. Long time no see. When did you get back? I see. He went to sensei. No, to Arishima sensei, the former director. I see. When he comes back tell him, I took two reels of 8 mm on the mountain. Come and see the film. If you like, please join us. You can continue your study while working at the hospital. But if I work in medical practice, that deprives me of study time. As shown in this case I had a conflict of two positions. Most of all, I couldn't save the life. I think I have a responsibility to make my attitude clear. You don't need to be so strict. To begin with, we can't isolate the bacterium of encephalitis epidemica yet. So, I'd like to concentrate on finding the bacterium and blood serum by working at the laboratory. Please support me by helpful intervention with the director. Alright. If you insist, I will talk to the director. Do as you like. Thank you very much, sir. I'm sorry I always ask you. Not at all. I shouldn't stay so long, it's bad for your health. No, don't worry. You treat me like a patient. I don't like it. I am alright. I'll give you something good. See my melon which I took care of. Did you call, sir? There are two balls in the refrigerator, you know? Cut the bigger one. Did you grow it by yourself? No, I have help, my nephew who is in agricultural college. I see. You were guaranteed success. Talking about help, why don't you use Oikawa Hatsu for your assistant? Oikawa-kun? She was my assistant for a long time. I know her very well. She's a very good worker. I know. However, she is often said to be cold or rather mean. She is a little bit too strict. Her eager nature is misunderstood sometimes. But she is not so unpleasant a woman as some people say. She is very reliable. But it's not easy to use her. Not easy to use, but useful. She is very good at raising guinea pigs and mice. Especially, most capable at catching the oestrous state of the guinea pig. I know none better than Oikawa Hatsu in the laboratory. - I see. Then I'll try to use her. - Do so. She would be willing to work for you now. She'll be very helpful for your research. Here you are. Now, help yourself. Don't you think this is good workmanship? Eat, eat, this is good. Brother, it's well shot. Think you're a critic? What do you know, sis. Be quiet. I wish I could have been there. Don't turn on the light. Don't. Sorry. Futagiri-san has come. Welcome, sir. Good evening. Sorry I was late. Our critics are noisy. We've started, but I'll start again later. Good evening. This is Ken-chan's favourite. Thank you. Mother. Thank you very much, sir. OK. Let's continue. The mountain part starts now. I'll watch too. - Please. - Thank you. Sumi, you can watch too. Sumi, turn off the light. We'll start from the beginning. Sumi, OK? Mountain Inn Tofu-ya The guide called Zen-san was very kind, he helped me a lot. Good. He sang for me at the hut. It was wonderful. He looks a good man really. Ni-san, you are a comedian anywhere. Ken-bo, this is 1818 m above sea level. Did you really climb up, ni-san? Yes, look. There I am. Kurobishi hut Yes. In the ski season this will be full. Oh, this is artistic. Ni-san, you filmed it very well. This is the end. Sumi, turn on the light. What's next? After that I couldn't. It got cloudy. Sumi, prepare the tea. Help her, Harue-San. If you hadn't returned I could have filmed many interesting places. Pity. I couldn't do it alone. I spoke with Fujimoto-kun earlier. Said you can't invite a doctor to travel. Well, not for this reason, but I'm determined to quit hospital work. Yes I heard that. And you'll use old maid forty-something as your assistant. You've been told already? What's an old maid? Mother, Ken-bo should go to bed, right? No way. Time for bed. Come. Excuse me. What is she like? What is she like? Anyway, she's been single for forty something years. A little bit odd, somehow. A stone hearted woman. I heard the old maid has a daughter of marriageable age. People say many things, but nobody knows the truth. A woman living alone for forty odd years, certainly looks mysterious. - Please. - Thank you. Mother, I'm back. Welcome. You are 30 minutes late. I dropped by Keiko-san's house. Did you need to go? I went to ask for a job. I want to work. I feel guilty with my mother working alone. Why suddenly say something like that? Mother, did something happen at the lab? Nothing. Nothing happened. You're hiding something. I'm very good at reading mother's face. So you started to say something? See? There is something. No. Oka-san. OK. It's done already. I'll tell you. I had a conflict in my job. But It's all right now. Thanks to Futagiri sensei I'll be able to work exclusively all the time like with Arishima sensei. Really? That's good. I've been worried. You don't need to worry about anything. But is it OK for me to work? Yes, you can. I've been giving. the matter some thought. You mean a job for me? It's late now. Let's talk tomorrow. Tell me. I want to start working soon. Anyway, just go to bed. You must be tired. - Aren't you going to bed yet? - Soon. Can I help you? You've washed your hands already. Alright then, good night. Where is Oikawa-kun? With the guinea pig. Shall I call her? Well, no. Look mother, this rabbit has a problem on its ear? It has black matter on its ear. That is coal tar. Is it to be applied to a wall? By applying coal tar to the same spot every day, the stress will initiate a cancer. What a shame. For the sake of research, you can't take pity like that. Eriko, go to custodian room and get some chalk. For the first injection group: A hundred in palsy, and fever and agitated 14-15. Record the process in detail. I passed an unfamiliar girl there. You did? That is my daughter. I'm sorry not to tell you, sir. I wanted to teach her to check the guinea pigs temperatures at least. Guinea pig temperatures? I see. I didn't know you had a daughter like that. She's a beautiful girl. Isn't it hard for her to handle the guinea pigs? But if something happens to me, nobody will take care of her. I want her to take care of herself. I thought that and brought her here. - What is her name? - Eriko. The kanji character "eri" is kimono collar. That's quite rare. But, a good name. As I called her Eriko, the name has became so lovely to me. Here you are. You must greet him. This is Futagiri sensei. Sensei is very kind to me for everything. Oh, we have already greeted one another. It's good for her to help you here, but Oikawa-kun, you'd better to report it to the office. I was going to do so after I watch her working. But maybe this is not a job for young people. Are you interested in it? Yes, but... But, what? - It's rather boring. - Eriko, what are you saying? That's true. It must be boring. This is the world of guinea pigs, not of human beings. But sensei, the world of human beings is more boring, isn't it? That is exactly Oikawa-kun's idea. Have you seen? They don't look at all alike. What are you talking about? Miss Oikawa's daughter. The old woman has a daughter? She's here. - What's she like? - Very beautiful. To tell you the truth, I don't like such a face. You like your face most. But unmarried Oikawa-san has a daughter. How strange. She's single, isn't she? Silly. Such things are not uncommon in this world. - Children are born outside marriage. - Don't say that, oji-san. You are noisy as usual. But sensei, this is a great news. I know. About Oikawa's daughter. You knew already? Young researchers always talk. But the woman Oikawa Hatsu is an arrogant woman. Because of her, several nurses and others had to leave their lab jobs over minor issues. A terrible woman. She talks discipline, but never minds her own. She'll soon regret it. I'm sorry, sir. Women are such chatterboxes. Male rumour mongers are much more noisy. But Oikawa Hatsu, who we thought had no feelings, has a daughter. It made us feel somehow pleasant. Pleasant feelings? I think a reason you have this pleasant feeling is that the daughter is a real beauty. You are very critical today. When such a beautiful girl appears, people start talking. Nevertheless, you alone are cool. You must have a reason. You're attacking me now. But it's a false accusation. No. You can't say so. Listen, I heard that Oikawa-kun clearly told the nurses that Eriko has no father. She said that Eriko's father was a wanderer who came like wind and went the same way. Why did she expressly say such a thing? It makes her daughter uncomfortable. The woman is really odd. The tumour marker clearly indicated encephalitis. Then, dissect now. Make the brain emulsion. We'll use the new mice to test the counter agent of the serum. Yes, we will. How many mice did we get? Sixteen. Then, I'll try eight to start with. Sensei. What's the matter? A guinea pig in room 38 has eaten three young which were born in 13. Maybe it was frightened by something. Separate them in the other chamber. It seems so weird. OK. I'll go with you. Thank you very much. You'll soon get used to it, then it'll be nothing. Here. Will you be working here long? Mother says so. It's a shame a young girl like you spending their life in this kind of job. I don't mind such a thing at all but, I don't want to be looked at by people with curious eyes. Curious eyes? Today I found abusive words about me and mother written on the restroom blackboard. What words? Mean old woman and her slut of a daughter. That's why I don't like the women in the laboratory. But don't mind whoever says it or whatever is said. Instead, you are very popular among the male doctors. How about Futagiri sensei? Me? I also like you very much. I doubt it. Futagiri sensei is well known as a women hater. Am I? That's a problem. But Oikawa Eriko is an exception. So don't worry. Thank you very much, sir. Please don't tell my mother. Sure. Eriko! What are you doing? You only met sensei a few days ago. Your attitude is rude and over-familiar. What is it that you can't tell mother? What are you saying to sensei? What were you saying to sensei? No, it's nothing. Forgive her. Eriko, was it nothing? If it's nothing, there's no need to ask sensei not to tell mother. Take it easy. It's too much. No, sir. She knows nothing. I have to teach her. Eriko, come. What were you saying? Don't hide it. Tell me. - It was nothing. - It shouldn't be. You can't tell? You can't tell mother? - Then, I will. - Do. On the restroom blackboard were abusive words about us. Why didn't you tell your mother? I worried you would be mad. Is it true? I'll go and see. Don't. You don't know. I was still a student then. I often heard the rumour that Dr. Arishima strongly favoured his assistant. The assistant was, that is, Miss Oikawa Hatsu. Therefore, I guess, the father of the girl is Dr. Arishima. She had done such a misconduct herself, nevertheless, she accuses your small mistakes, or expels you. It's quite outrageous. If you get a chance, you can ask her. I'm sure the woman cannot answer. But we couldn't ask such a thing. No, we can't. Then I'll demand her answer when I get a chance. Sawamura sensei. Tell me clearly what you have just said, sir. If you insist, I can say. Sensei, beyond all sense of shame, I honestly revealed to you, that Eriko is fatherless. Can't you be satisfied with that? You are man. A man who talks ill of a weak woman. Do you enjoy it? In addition, of all things, you disgrace Dr. Arishima. Where are you working now? You were taught by Dr. Arishima and work at Arishima sensei's laboratory. Have you never thought how much you owe Dr. Arishima? You are a coward. Why talk ill of me behind my back... Shall I tell why, in front of everyone? - Shall I tell? - Take it easy. You've said enough. Be patient. Leave me alone. Who wrote that? Who wrote that? Ohatsu-san Hatsu-dono Mean old woman's child Slut We have done nothing wrong to be written of like this. If you want to say something, don't do nasty things like this. Just go to the director and state things fairly. This... Oikawa-san... The director is calling you. Director's Room Director. Oikawa-kun. Dr. Arishima has passed away. Arishima sensei passed away? Is it true, sir? It's not official, but we were informed. You have long worked with the doctor. and know about his household too. Will you go to his house to help? You can take a break from your current job. I will go later. Who is it? What brought you? I was passing. Has Arishima sensei passed away? Yes, it's a real shame. Have a seat. Had he been ill long? No, he looked fine. I wish he'd lived longer for his institute. Yes, it's a pity indeed. You must have been busy. Yes. Have you done all the tidy-up tasks? Almost. Except for the publication. Publication? We've create a book, collecting sensei's essays and articles. They'll be shared with the public. Good idea. Is that it? Yes, there are many. So currently I'm very busy due to this editing as well as at the lab. OK. I can help a little. You are rich. Help with publication. If you have no other plans, I can find a publisher. Can you? Please do. We are not good at money matters. Actually we were waiting for an understanding investor like you. Don't flatter me. No, it's true. Look at this thin glass. It's sandwiched between two thin slides for the microscope. It is called a präparat. It's not easy at first though. Look at this. You can see clearly. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Sensei, good morning, sir. Oikawa-kun. It seems to be getting hot today too. Futagiri-kun. Please. Thank you very much. So you've been appointed. Congratulations on your promotion. Promotion, I wonder. Anyway, the future is on the continent. If you come to Beijing, visit me. You are most welcome. When will you leave? Both of us are busy. Don't worry about that. I wish you success. Fetch me some water. Oikawa-kun, fetch five pieces of xxx from somewhere. Thank you. You know Izumi Harue-san, don't you? Yes, she is my school mate. How could you know? She is the sister of my best friend. Accidentally we started talking about you. She was missing you. Eriko. Then... Take that. This? A bigger one. This? Yes. Clear the cards. Thank you for this. You were a swimmer at school? - Why don't we go swimming someday? - Yes. Do you like swimming too? Eriko! Don't you understand what I said? But, that's impossible, mother. What's impossible? Why can't I talk with sensei? Because I say so. If you cannot listen to me, you shan't come here anymore. Go home. What's the matter? Nothing, sir. Leave her alone. If sensei treats her gently she will be spoiled. What's wrong? Why did she scold you? Sensei, I don't know what to do. What? Mother told me never talk to sensei, except when work related. Oikawa-kun, why are you so obstinate with her? This is a sacred laboratory, sir. Eriko forgets so easily. She's always chatting and laughing. It's not important. It's impossible for a young girl to concentrate on study alone. Chattering too. Very often I've started it. If I start to chat, she will respond and laugh. - That's the problem, sir. - No, it's not. It doesn't affect her job. Yes it does. Chattering would disturb her work. Now I am scolded by you too. No... She often forgets what she should and shouldn't do. If sensei treats her gently... But she is young, you are too harsh. No, sir. Sensei has never joked with the young assistants. The reason for the abusive words is that she is an illegitimate child. I won't bring Eriko here anymore. You can do as you wish. Good morning, sir. I've completed this, sir. No, not here. No, not here. It's the hospital. Oikawa-kun, come. - Give me a hand. - Escaped? I've caught it, sir. Thank you. That was quick. I haven't seen Eriko-kun. On holiday? No, she won't be coming here anymore. Oh, she quit? Ouch! - Bitten? - Yes, a small one. You must disinfect it immediately. A good book. Yes. I glanced at it in the car. Very interesting. You see. His writing has a literary aroma, even in a medical article. Oikawa-kun. Oikawa-kun. - What's the matter? - Nothing, sir. Good day. We made it. So good. - Can I borrow some scissors? - Yes, there. To Futagiri sensei Eriko Don't you want some ice cream? Take it. Who is it? Sensei. You. What's the matter, at this hour? May I come in? Well, do come in. Sensei, let me stay here for a while. What's the matter? Mother found that I sent sensei a letter. Mother accused me so badly. I see. I've never seen her in such a rage. She hit me and threw things. I couldn't stand it anymore, and so I sneaked away. Sensei, why is mother so furious against me and sensei being together? I have no idea. Maybe living together so long made her so. But it's too much. Were you scolded often before? No, never. It's only started since I've been at the lab. About sensei, she's gone crazy. I don't know why. As mother gets mad I rely on sensei all the more. Sensei, please. Let me stay here. All right. You can stay here. How nice. Where are you going, sir? I'm going to see Oikawa-kun. Why? If you stay here I'll need Oikawa-kun's permission. I can't do it without. I'll talk to her clearly. If Oikawa-kun won't listen, I'll continue day after day. While I'm out, you can eat downstairs. Sign the bill with my name. I don't want to eat. I'll wait here forever. Even if I starve to death. Anyway I won't let you die. Really, sensei? I don't want to see you suffer anymore. Then, just wait. Sensei. Don't bring mother here. If you do I really will die. Don't worry. Lock it and wait. Tell me frankly, what's on your mind. You are her mother, but you have no right to control your daughter's freedom. If you don't want give me your dearest daughter... - No, it's not that, sir. - Then what? Do you think we two are not serious? I know it's not long that we've known each other, but it's not just a fling as you seem to think. I love Eriko wholeheartedly. Eriko trusts me wholeheartedly too. I don't understand why you oppose us so vigorously. If you can't allow us, tell me the reason. I feel that you oppose us without any reason. I begin to doubt your love as a mother. No, you go too far. But your attitude is... No. When this happened, I had no choice. I will tell you everything. I understand your deep love. I believe you can keep the secret. Secret? Eriko... Eriko is... is not my real daughter. What? She is not your child? Are you... I trust your love, I will tell you everything. But please, keep it secret. She is the secret child of Dr. Arishima and a lady of a distinguished family. Arishima sensei? Is it true? I wouldn't tell a lie. The lady was single but was the daughter of distinguished family. If it was revealed, not only Arishima sensei but the name of the laboratory would be disgraced. Dr. Arishima suffered, revealed the secret to me and asked me for help. At the time... I was 23 years old. I was very upset. Maybe you couldn't understand my feelings. I respected him more than anyone else. It was a love far beyond that between master and pupil. I loved him secretly. I thought I could sacrifice my life for Arishima sensei. The job given to me then was, being mother to his child. I took responsibility for the name of Arishima sensei and the laboratory. Even the respectable Arishima sensei had committed such immorality. After that, how could I trust and love anyone? Since then the living philosophy of Oikawa Hatsu has totally changed. I understand you. I didn't expect that, Eriko was the daughter of Arishima sensei. Nobody knows, of course. The doctor has passed away. And now... No one knows but me. Eriko believes I am her real mother. Look at this, sir. The doctor kept a trust in Eriko's name. He looked after me also. But now I am worried. If I die, Eriko has to live as the illegitimate child of unknown Oikawa Hatsu. Trust Contract between Miss Oikawa Eriko and Mitsui Shintaku Trust Co. Ltd. Thinking about it, I don't know what to do. But to whom could I tell the truth? Finally I decided to bring her to the laboratory. It is the laboratory her father established. Where she could do her work. But it was the cleverness of women. Eriko had a crush on you as soon as she met you. It reminded me of my past experience. It seemed like fate. Eriko fell in love with you, as a result. Eriko might follow my fate and not obtain the happiness of a woman. Just as I have not known happiness. Getting old, after all. That is what I believed. I tried to separate Eriko from you. I didn't want that Eriko should follow my fate. But sensei, tonight, I was abandoned by Eriko. One whom I brought up with my love and sacrifice. I envy Eriko. Eriko rushed into your arms as she wished. I could not do even one tenth of that. I might have been able now, to explain my feelings, but Arishima sensei has passed away so suddenly, without a will as you know. He never said what should happen with Eriko, let alone mention me, Oikawa Hatsu. Eriko. Sensei? What happened, sensei? We had a good talk. Anyway you must go home. Your mother understands you very well. If she understands me, she wouldn't accuse me like that. Oikawa-kun is a respectable person, ten, twenty times better than we thought. She is not cruel, not cold. She loves you wholeheartedly. No, I don't think so. Eriko, you must trust your mother. Compared with her love for you, my love for you, might even be thought frivolous. I was impressed by the beautiful sacrifice of Oikawa Hatsu in bringing you up. I realized the deepness of human love. Listen, you must go home. Go home and grow up in the love of your mother. I understand. No, you don't understand. You are just resisting. Yes, I am resisting. You said you understand how deep my mother's love is, but it is your own understanding. I had no reason to be accused and abused so I escaped to you. - If it's not malicious, what is it? - No, it wasn't. Your mother was deceived by a wanderer who came from nowhere, and had you. In the same way, she thought you might be deceived by me. She was really worried. I'm not... Your mother thought Futagiri a scientist who cannot understand human sentiment or women's feelings. She wanted to prevent Eriko going astray in a hard life like herself. Oikawa Hatsu feared that. What did you say to that, sensei? Did you surrender easily? Coward! No. Listen to me a little more. Oikawa-kun listened to me and understood. Finally she accepted us. She accepted? She told me "If you seriously love Eriko "I can give her to you, even tonight." Sensei, is it true? It's true. Her voice broke in saying that. She was overwhelmed by the loneliness of a mother who will be alone, as well as the utmost love for her daughter, she wept... she wept. And after she finished she collapsed and cried out loud. I told her that, my love for Eriko is no match for her love, yet we must work hard to raise up our love to the same eternal level. So I would send Eriko back tonight. I told her so. I understand. You understand? If you understand, go home. I will take you back. Your mother waits for you. I'm sorry. Sensei, you are mean. You didn't tell me the good news first. I can go home alone now. Well, well. No, I want you to take me back. Oikawa-kun is late today. That's strange. Welcome. Oh, a rare visitor. Good day. Come in. How is your mother? - She is sick. - Sick? This is a notice of absence. How bad? She has a high fever. She complained of her injured finger. It was painful. She couldn't sleep last night. Injured finger? - Was it the wound? - What is it? She was bitten by a guinea pig. It has streptococcal bacteria Really? If so, it's dangerous. She must have disinfected it. I hope it's OK. Notice of absence Oikawa Hatsu I, hereby report that, for personal reasons, I take holiday leave. I'll go see her. She told me not to bother the lab staff. No, it might be serious. - Finish my work. - He is right. Have a seat. Don't worry. Yes, she is. Wait a moment please. Oikawa-san, telephone. Hello, it's Eriko. Oh, you are oba-san from next door? Sensei, what shall I do? Mother's got suddenly worse. Give it to me. Hello, could you tell me her situation please? I see. I'll come immediately. Go to the garage and prepare an ambulance. Fujimoto-kun, prepare an injection. It seems like acute sepsis. Is that so? Sensei, is she alright? The injection has given her a little peace, but it's still serious. Please save mother. I will do my best. You must have a rest. No, I'll stay here. Oikawa-kun, how are you? I feel better than before. But I am prepared now. I am quite prepared. Your sickness was caused by your duty. The director has promised to give you the best care in the hospital. Thank you very much, sir. Oikawa Hatsu is honoured for life. But, how did I make such a stupid mistake? At least I wanted to die for the benefit of sensei's research. Oikawa-kun... I regret that. Don't get excited. Don't talk anymore. I know I cannot survive. Mother... While I am conscious, I want to tell something to sensei. Will you all leave the room, except for sensei? Fujimoto-kun, prepare the camphor. No need, sensei. Please make them all leave the room now. What about Eriko? Please ask her what I want to know. About... my father. Are they all gone? - Are you alone, sensei? - Yes. I am alone. Sensei, I'm very happy to confess to you alone alone about Eriko's identity. If I hadn't confessed, how could I die well? But, please don't tell Eriko immediately. Wait until she's convinced of her happiness with you. She must keep believing that poor Oikawa Hatsu had this illegitimate child. I understand. Don't worry. You can believe that Eriko is the child of Arishima sensei? You believe don't you? Yes, I do. Thank you very much, sir. Oikawa Hatsu, for 44 years has kept her chastity. It was not in vain. Sensei, now I know that Eriko will know the truth the truth that she is not my child... Now I want to ask you something. Tell me. Calm down. You can say whatever you wish. If I... When I die... In my coffin... I understand. Be quite sure. I will do as you wish. Fujimoto-kun. Maybe it's better to call Eriko. Sensei, Oikawa Hatsu is... a virgin, sir. Mother, hold on. It's Eriko. Can you see? Autopsy Room Hey, who turned off the light? O, sensei. Excuse me, sir. You are still here? Have you completed it, sir? Was it true, what Oikawa-kun said? Yes, it was true. Was it really? It means Eriko-kun is not Oikawa-kun's child. Someday I will tell the truth about it. Till then keep this secret in your heart alone. Collection of articles by Dr. Arishima I want to take a rest. Take a holiday and travel. You see? Another. So good. Your mother was a good mother indeed. I still can't believe that mother is dead. I see. I feel she's waiting and will call me "Eriko" when I get back to Tokyo. Sorry. No problem. It's reflected there. I can get it. Mother! Mother! END Subtitles: Maya Grohn corvusalbus & MFuzuli edit
