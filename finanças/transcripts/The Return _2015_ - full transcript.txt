( music playing ) ( birds chirping ) ( birds squawking ) ( flute playing ) - Hey! - I'm sorry. Be gone, you foul cretin. It was an accident. You'll find something here. - Oh! - I'm Sorry! I'm Sorry! - Fool! - I'm sorry, it was an accident. Get away! Get away! I'll take care of it. How about a swig, lassie? Made it myself. Yesterday... was a very good... year. - ( clapping ) - Who is next? Who among ye have an eye that is quicker than me hand? How about you, sir? Me? I don't think so. What? Are you afraid of my powers? Certainly not! How about that fine ring of yours, sir? Certainly, I will be unable to hide that precious bit of jewelry from you. - W-well, I... - Oh, go on. Let him have a try at it. ( laughs ) All right, then. Wagers in everyone. It's quite simple, sir, Just keep your eye on the cup that covers your ring. There is really nothing to it. Tell me, girl, where is the ring? Ah-ha-ha-ha. ( clapping ) You see, it is easy. Even this simpleton can follow along. Now, sir. Under which cup will we find your ring? - ( explosion ) - What was that? Pay it no attention! Just the guards' midday salute. It's a bit early today, but no matter. We have a ring to find. Well, my lord? - Under that cup. - Oh, is it? All right then. Let's start with this one. All: Ah. So, you think it's under this one? All right, then. Let us see. ( crowd gasps ) So sorry, my friend, but once again the hand is quicker than the... - eye? - ( crowd gasps ) Magician, where is my ring? Well, now-- now, don't get excited. It has to be here, somewhere! - Thief! - No, I am not-- Guard! I've been robbed! Arrest him. It has to be here. No! Now, wait. No! I am innocent, I tell you! Innocent! Let me go! Man: Well, now, what have we here? Please, let me pass. What's your hurry? Hello. Didn't anyone ever tell you it's not safe to be out in these woods all alone? Well, Wretch, I think we're gonna have to teach this one a lesson. Don't start anything you won't be able to finish. Oh, looks like we found a fiery one, hey, Brute? ( cries ) Wretch? Get up! ( clothes ripping ) ( groans ) ( chuckles ) Would you like another dance? No, thank you. My loss. What a pity. ( gasps ) You're right. It isn't safe in the woods. You should be more careful. ( groans ) ( groans ) Ow. - Hey! - I'm sorry. Be gone, you foul cretin! It was an accident. In chaos can be found opportunity. ( chuckles ) Your ring? ( explosion ) Yes, you have, simpleton. I am good. Yes you are. The best. Well, second best. - Good evening, Leah. - Dybbuk. Is that anyway to greet your benefactor, your protector, your angel? You don't seem happy to see me. You wouldn't want to hurt my feelings would you? - I bruise easy. - What do you want? ( chuckles ) Do you really have to ask? What about my share? Since you failed to follow the simple basic rule of bringing me my payment directly, there is a penalty. There are consequences for one's actions, Leah. Learn from it. This is everything? Of course. Don't you trust me, Dybbuk? ( laughs ) Trust is a dangerous vice. Well, seeing our business to be done, this concludes our meeting. Don't make me have to come back... here. You made me come back. Trust is a dangerous vice. ( inhales ) ( groans ) Secure your door. There's evil out in the night. ( chattering ) ( laughing ) Ahem. ( laughing ) - Ah! - Taker. - Leia! - Leah! It is Leah! Leah, Leah. Forgive me, Leah. How are you this morning, my dear? Hand it over. ( whines ) ( sighing ) One day I will win the challenge, my dear. Perhaps, but not today. Admittedly, though, it was a nice touch with the bag of stones. ( laughs ) I had you fooled, if only for one moment. So, what do we have today? Oh, well, um, first, two merchant ships are coming into port. By noon, the sailors will be good and drunk and an easy pinch! Good. What else? The spice merchant has some exotic new flavorings in from the Orient. Expensive and very popular with the ladies, I hear. - Oh, are they, now? - Yeah, but... we're getting more competition from those low-life beggars. How loathsome to have to beg for your living rather than doing the honorable thing and stealing it. - Man: Help me, someone. - And the new one is blind. - Worth an extra shilling. - Man: Please. - Isn't he the--? - The magician. Yeah. Sentenced to a life of blindness by the Magistrate. Caught stealing from a nobleman, I hear. - Magician: Help me, someone. - I guess the hands are quicker than the eyes. At least his eyes. ( laughs ) Is something wrong, my dear? You look as though you've seen a ghost. What? No. I'm fine. - Just tired. - Ah. Alas, no rest for the wicked. Well, we'd best get back to work. The day is young. Oh, look! What? - Look there! - ( squawks ) ( laughing ) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Um... what do you want? Your friend dropped this. I assumed it was of value. I wouldn't know. Well... will you see to it that it is returned? Good day. Will you help me? Will you help me? Please help me find my way. Please, someone. Help me, please. ( dog barking ) Going somewhere, are we? You tell me. It's her again. Is there a problem, gentlemen? No. No. No. No problems. We were just patrolling the village to ensure your safe passage. How kind. I am thankful. - Good day, gentlemen. - Good day. - Where are your manners? - Uh, good day. A bit of a spitfire, that one. More of a dragon, if you ask me. - Oh, no! - What? My dagger! It's gone! - ( Brute laughing ) - She did it again! - ( laughing ) - It's not funny. Dybbuk. Come out. I have a dagger and I know how to use it. What is this? A dream? I'm fine. Just tired. Ah. Alas, no rest for the wicked. Taker. No scorpions! He's losing his touch. ( giggles ) ( laughs ) ( sighs ) ( birds chirping ) No, no! ( items clanging ) ( gags ) Oh. These will bring a good price. Good day. Oh, you. You startled me. Good day. What are you doing here? The same as you. I doubt that. I was hoping to... To what? Nothing. What? You look different since the last time we met. What are you talking about? Well, dare I say... well-rested. You must be sleeping well. ( gasps ) You? The bed is from you? Thank you! Ah, you're welcome. What-- what bed? Thee bed-- Taker! Oh, my dear, my dear, my dear. What are you doing here? Talking to you. What bed? - The bed you gave me. - Right. That bed. It wasn't you? You have put me in a predicament. You see, as much as I would like to continue the embrace-- um, no. Who then? My dear, what are you talking about? - Come with me. - Where to? - My cottage. - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know a shortcut. I know a shortcut. Here, let me help you with that. Right this way, my dear. - Come, come, come, come, come. - This should be fun. ( panting ) - Shortcut, huh? - Shh. Shh. Shh. I know exactly where we are. So do I. Lost. No. No, no, that's not-- where are you going, my dear? We-- we must go... this way. ( birds chirping ) - Hello, friend. - Oh, greetings. Can we be of assistance? Yes, if you would. Might you tell me how I can find the clearing? - We might. - Ah. - For a price. - Huh? - Your life. - Oh, now look here, my fine fellows. - I'm not looking for any trouble. - Well, you found it. Huh? Uh, trouble, you say? Uh, you'll find no trouble here, sir. ( nervous chuckle ) Uh, we would be happy to be of assistance. Uh, you can find the clearing a stone's throw in that direction. Ah, okay. Can we leave now? By all means. Ah! ( chuckles ) See, my dear, stick close to me, and no harm will ever overtake you. Give me that. Give me that. Give me that! Sorry. But did you see the way I stood up to those two-- - Shut up, Taker. - Really! No. - I mean, with my fierceness, my valor-- - S top talking . Now you can now plainly see, my dear, why it is known far and wide that I am the most courageous of our den of heinous thieves. - Leia! - Leah! Leah, Leah, Leah. What is that most agreeable bouquet in the air? - Come and see. - A party! You concocted a surprise party for me and you invited all of my friends. - Wait, I don't have any friends. - Mm. Leah, wha-- what is going on? I don't know. The bed arrived early last week, and the food started coming two days ago, exactly one week later. And you have been eating this food for two days... ( sniffs ) ...and have experienced no ill effects? None. In fact, I've never felt better. Well, then. ( clears throat ) My lady, dinner is served. - ( laughing ) - Well, thank you, kind sir. ( both laugh ) So "behold joy and gladness, let us eat and drink!" "For tomorrow, we die." If so, why go on an empty stomach? Mm. Mm. - Mm. - Eat! And drink. - I like these. - Yeah. - Mm-mm. - Oh, oh, oh. ( sighs ) Oh. Soup. Mm. Mm. Yum. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm? Hmm? All right, yeah, okay. All right, good, good. Ooh. Lee? - Ooh. - Hey, hey. Mm. Ah, ooh, oh. - Leah? - Good Morning, Taker. Ah! Oh, don't do that! - Pastry? - ( muffled ) Oh. Oh, that's good. No kidding. What's wrong? What's wrong? Oh, let's see. First you invited me here for a huge feast that you have no idea from where it came. Remarkable, isn't it? Second, I wake this morning to find the cottage immaculately clean, except for a basket of pastry and a pot of hot tea. I know, it's been the same every morning. And third, those candles have been burning in there all night and they haven't gotten any smaller. I noticed that. Hey, well, don't you find all this just a little odd? You know what they say. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. You may find out its true age. Or, it may bite you. Now, whoever is doing this is doing it for a reason. Like what? They want something from you. What if-- - What if... - Leah: Go on. ...your secret admirer is Dybbuk? Think about it. - I have. - Mm-hmm. What could I possibly have that he would want? I've already given him everything. ( sighs ) Not, everything, my dear. Well, uh, thank you for a most filling and unusual evening. Oh... and, uh... be very careful from whose cup you drink, my dear. Day's half gone already. Taker's shortcut it is. ( growling ) ( growling ) ( growling, whispering ) ( hissing ) - ( wind gusting ) - ( leaves rustling ) ( growling, whispering continues ) ( gasps ) Do not fear. I am with you. ( growling continues ) ( hissing ) - ( muffled cries ) - Shh. They will flee. See, nothing to fear. Come. Walk with me. What's wrong? They may come back. Be free of your fear. And why should I trust you? - Do I look dangerous? - No. But wolves often appear in sheep's clothing. Well, it seems you have two choices. You can go back the way you came, or you can come with me. - What brings you into the woods? - A shortcut. ( chuckles ) Then you must be late. - Yes, very. - Late for what? My work. What is it that you do? I, uh-- I-- it's not important. Not important? ( chuckles ) All things are important. What is it that you do? - I redistribute wealth. - ( chuckles ) - So, you are a tax collector. - Sort of. You are a thief. Thief? I am not. Yes you are. How dare you? What gives you the right to call me a thief? The truth. Are you coming, Leah? You have me at a disadvantage, sir. You know my name, but I do not know yours. Forgive me. I am Yadid. Yadid. How do you know me? You are known. Really? Well, what else do you know about me? I know that your father was killed in battle when you were very young. That your mother left you to be raised by relatives. They weren't very kind to you. Leah, get inside. You'll learn to hold your tongue. As soon as you were able, you ran off. You traveled from town to hamlet, to village living off of "redistributed wealth." Hey! You! Stop! Yadid: For the last two years, you've called the abandoned cottage at wood's end home. You are also known to be very intelligent and brave. ( laughs ) Just ask the two half-witted scoundrels that live in these very woods. They're scared to death of you. Sketchy information at best. What else do you have? That you are under the mastery of one known as Dybbuk. I have no master. That's not what the palm of your hand says. The village of Nod is right through that clearing. Your duty calls. Thank you-- ( sighs ) Three lit candles. That's new. There has to be something. - Nothing! - ( gasps ) Oh! Taker. What are you doing here? Oh, I arrived here an hour ago. And I waited. Right there in your bed. And I peered into the room hoping to catch a glimpse of your admirer. And then suddenly-- What? There was a glow coming from three lit candles. Well, Who lit them? No one. - And then... - And then what? Nothing. And then nothing else. You probably scared him away. ( scoffs ) I don't understand. Are you sure this is the right day? Of course I'm sure. The bed arrived two weeks ago today. The food arrived one week ago today. Of which there is still plenty. Oh. ( chuckles ) Enough for you to invite me for dinner? Yes. You are too kind. Allow me, my dear. No. Sit down. All right. Maybe the candles are it. The story of my life. I get my hopes up and then... ( blows raspberry ) ...nothing! Taker, are you familiar with a huntsman by the name of Yadid? Yadid? No, I don't believe I am. Um, pass the bread, please. - Why do you ask? - Oh, no reason. - It's just that-- - ( music playing ) What is that noise? It's music. ( groans ) Make it stop. It's ruining my appetite. Isn't there a law against disturbing the peace or something? I think it's beautiful. Excuse me. - ( music stops ) - Yes, my lady? What are you doing? Playing music. Yes, I can see that. But, why? It is what I do. Why here? It pleases my master for me to do so. Who is your master? It is his will to remain anonymous. Does my music disturb you? Yes, it disturbs me greatly. I feel an upset stomach coming on. Taker-- no, it doesn't. Your upset stomach has nothing to do with music, I assure you. Well, I hate to eat and run, but a person can't even hear himself chew around here. And if this is the third gift, I remain disappointed. Good night, my dear. And you, keep your day job, huh? Good night, Taker. Not a lover of the finer things, is he? No, well if it's not food, that is. Sweet dreams, my lady. G'night. ( music resumes ) ( music continues ) I have been much too forbearing, too tolerant, of this one's impudence. The time has come to execute a plan. Is there any more information you wish to share? Oh, um, yes. She-- uh, Leah, asked me if I was familiar with a-- a-- a certain huntsman, named, ah, Yadid. - Yadid? - Yes, my lord. Leave me. As you wish, my lord. Not a word of this to the woman. I wouldn't want to see any unfortunate circumstances due to a loose tongue. Uh-- yes, sir. I mean-- no, sir. Good night, sir. This is ridiculous. ( knock on door ) - Who's there? - It's me, Taker. Go away, Taker. What's going on? Nothing. Taker: Come on, Leah. Don't lie to me. It's exactly one week later. There is no gift. Uh-huh. It must be quite wonderful if you're trying to keep it a secret from me. I said there's nothing. You trust me, don't you? - Of course I do. - Then let me in. ( coughing ) I'm not feeling well, Taker. ( coughs ) I'm gonna go to bed. - ( coughing ) - Taker: Leah! Leah: I'll see you tomorrow. ( Lea continues coughing ) Good night, Taker. As you wish, my dear. A dance? Why, thank you, my lord. You dance superbly. You flatter me, sir. Yes, I do. ( both laugh ) But, you're not terrible. Thank you. I think. Your dress does become you. Oh, this old thing? It's just something I threw on. In fact, I didn't even know I had it. ( gasps ) Can I cut in? Come now. What's one dance among old friends? Do you like the dress? Yes. I thought you would. These are from you? Well... And the musician and the banquets - and the--? - Bed? Why? I have been uncharitable to you. After all, you are the most profitable thief in my service. I see. Do you? Do you see, Leah? There is so much more I can give you. You can have anything you ever dreamed. You'll never go hungry. You will be under my protection. No one or no thing would ever dare to hurt you. It is late. Yes, it is. Promise me you'll sleep on my suggestion. This is all I ask. Good night, Leah. ( sighs ) Your duty calls. After all, you are the most profitable thief in my service. Don't fear. I am with you. You will be under my protection. No one or no thing would ever dare to hurt you. You can go back the way you came or you can come with me. - Hello, thief. - Sheriff. No, you don't understand. I was just picking it up off the ground. You picked it all right. I've been waiting to catch you picking for a long time. - I was just gonna return it-- - Save it for the magistrate. It's off to the dungeon for you. - ( grunts ) - Ah! Ah. ( chuckles ) A toy? Guards! Guards! The girl! The girl! After her! Oh, what is your hurry, my dear? - Taker! h, thank goodness. - Hello, Leah. I know a place where we can avoid the path and guards and get to the river. There is a place we can cross safely and be free of Nod forever. What's wrong? It is impossible to ever leave Nod. What do you mean? Taker, what are you doing? What are you doing? - I got her! - What are you-- - Taker? What are you doing? - Here the thief. I caught her. - No. What are you do-- - There she is! Get her! Taker, what-- Guard: Here, come with us. ( cries ) No, Taker. Let me go. Let me go. ( rain pattering ) ( gasps ) ( crying ) Guard. Oh, I love what you've done with the place. I didn't do it. I didn't steal that purse. Well, that's a shame, now isn't it? I mean it is your job, to steal. It's not like you to be so sloppy. Are you distracted? It wouldn't be a huntsman by the name of Yadid, would it? Yeah. Your friend, Taker, informed me of this insolent suitor. It's of little consequence. There's nothing he can do for you now... here. I believe you are in a tight spot. A position that requires a person of great influence to be able to save you. Say the word, Leah, and you shall be free. Free? Is that what you call it? Don't take too long to decide. This town is hungry for a good execution. Dry bones, come to life. Alas, there comes a time when even my power has no influence. Here, day or night, it doesn't matter. But, I assure you the sun is setting. ( chatter ) Silence. ( chatter stops ) All rise for the Lord High Magistrate of Nod and all its hamlets and lands. Be seated. Present the accused. ( crowd heckling ) Your Excellency, sitting before you is one Leah, citizen of Nod. She is indicted on charges of theft of a money purse containing 12 gold coins-- ruination of a merchant stand... Worth three day's wages. ...resisting lawful arrest, and assault of the magistrate's sheriff. What say you of these charges? I was only trying to return the purse to its owner. ( crowd shouting indistinctly ) It is true! Magistrate? Your Excellency, in regard to these charges, she was caught red-handed before many witnesses. However, we are of the opinion that this was not her first offense toward you and the people of Nod. ( chattering ) A search of her cottage has provided us with many a new revelation. ( crowd members gasp ) - Woman: The necklace. - Man: There's my necklace. Woman: That's my grandmother's necklace. These items found from thefts that have taken place in Nod were found in her dwelling place. ( crowd groans ) But that's not all. Is it? There's more. What else did we find in your humble home? A banquet table made of fine wood. A dress of magnificent material. A bed fit for a queen. How can one of such modest means afford such luxury? - They were gifts. - Gifts? - Man #2: It's a lie. - Gifts? What about this? This ring that was stolen from the magician's table. A theft that caused an innocent man to be blind. Your excellency, for these crimes... I call for the woman to be sentenced to death. ( crowd cheering ) Woman #2: Death! Kill her! The perfect fit. Is there anything the defendant would like to say to this court that may weigh favorably on it's verdict? There is nothing. Well, then. This court finds Leah of Nod guilty of all charges and sentences her to be punished by death. ( crowd cheering ) The execution to take place-- Sheriff, what is the hour? Sherriff: Noon, your Excellency. Now. Take her away. ( cheering ) - Don't-- - Let him approach. Taker: Please, show mercy, Dybbuk. Here, I don't want your money, take it. Just show Leah mercy. This is my lucky day. I rid the village of a thief and it doesn't cost me a thing. Know your place. Should you stand in this spot again, it would be risky for you. Where are you going? The party is that way. Oh. ( chuckles ) I insist you join me in wishing your friend a pleasant journey. No. No. Having found the defendant guilty of the all charges, she is sentenced to die by an arrow to the heart. ( crowd cheering ) Let us hope this Archer is a good shot, or this could get messy. Stop! What now? I command you to put down that weapon and set this woman free. ( laughter ) There is one in every crowd. What is the meaning of this disruption? I order you to release her. Do you know to whom you are speaking? ( chuckles ) Yes. Does he? ( chuckles ) Under whose authority do you make such request? I command it, in the name of the king. ( laughs ) It seems as though there is a new jester in town. So you are the king? I am charged with his authority. I am his son. ( crowd laughs ) You? It's been you all along? The bed, the dress, the banquets, the music, the candles. The light. Yes, it is I. Surely, your royal highness, the King would not set a thief free. What message would that send to the fine citizens of Nod? A message of mercy. No. Weakness. She dies. Step aside royal imposter and let justice be served. ( crowd cheering ) If it is blood you want, it is blood you will have. Mine. ( murmuring ) I will die in her place. This is my lucky day. Oh, why not? Release her. Seize him. ( crowd cheering ) - No. You can't do this. - I must. - But, why? - Because, I love you. Do not be afraid. I am with you. Now, I am a man who likes to show the mighty proper respect. I cannot have a prince sent off to his death dressed as a mere peasant. Guard, remove your cape. Ladies and Gentlemen-- your Sovereign, your Monarch, your Potentate! ( laughing ) Quiet! Quiet! Do you hear the sound of an approaching army? Is it the roar of the King's men rushing to save his son? No. No, no, no. Only silence. Do what you will. Patience. Haven't you ever heard of creating dramatic tension? Get on with it. ( gasps ) Then the bow shall be broken. No, no, no! ( crying ) ( crowd cheering ) He's dead. Be certain. What is it? He wears the King's insignia! He is of royal blood. Dybbuk killed the son of the King! Ah! Ah! ( townspeople whispering ) I believe your lucky day may have taken a turn for the worse. ( crying ) ( birds squawking ) ( gasps ) Leah. ( gasping ) Are you-- are you really here? What do your eyes say? Yes? But, they have often been known to lie to me. Then what does your heart say? Yes. ( crying ) You have a very wise heart. I saw you die. You did. How is it you are here? I am the son of the king. Yes, but... the arrow and Dybbuk's mace, and... There are many things I have to tell you. But you are not yet ready to bear them. Yes, your highness. ( gasps ) - Are you hungry? - ( laughs ) Yes, I am. I will make you a meal fit for a prince. Thank you. ( knock on door ) Who's there? Taker: It is I, my dear. Taker? Taker: Yes. I don't think now is the best time. Taker: Please, please, I must speak with you. Coming. Hello. May I come in? Just for a moment? - Please. - Oh, thank you. What do you want? Is there more you need to share with Dybbuk? I-- I know that there is no reason for you to do so... but I ask-- I beg for your forgiveness. ( voice breaks ) I betrayed you, first for money, and then for my life. Dybbuk's power over me was great, but that is no excuse for what I did to you. You're right. But I am very sorry. Very sorry. I had wanted to pay for my transgression with the only thing I have-- my life. Your life? I left the village that day determined to die. Even if I had to do it myself. And yet, you are here. Yes. As I stood in the woods with that noose around my neck, I realized something. - What? - I realized that it's not me being a coward that was stopping me. Actually, I would have been a coward if I had gone through with it. Then, I-- I-- I realized something else. And what was that? I realized that the log I was standing on was wet and very slippery. I could have killed myself. I mean, no, I didn't want to kill myself, - but by standing on it, and the noose around-- - I-- I get it. - I know what you mean, Taker. - Yeah. But I also realized that the brave thing for me to do would be to live-- live my life. And follow the path, good or bad, that lies before me. But I had to come to see you. I had to ask, though undeserving, for your forgiveness. You have it. I forgive you. Oh. Thank-- yeah? Thank you, my dear. Thank you. Oh. This-- this-- this calls for a celebration. May I propose a toast? - Hello. - Taker. I had no idea what you were gonna say, I just knew I had to come here... ( glass clatters ) Is there someone else in the room? Yes, Taker. Is it His Royal Highness, the Son of the King? Yes, Taker. Peace to you, Taker. My-- oh, uh, Your High-- But, arrow? ( blows raspberry ) Heart? How? How? ( both laugh ) More questions? Arrest me. Take me away. Lock me in the dungeon and throw away the key. Taker, you are free. Free? How can I be free? Look at your palm. ( gasps ) ( laughs ) I'm free. Leah, look, I am free. - I know. - ( gasps ) We were just about to sit down for a meal Would you like to join us, Taker? A meal? I suppose I could eat a little something. ( laughs ) Oh. Oh. Oh, man. ( flute music playing ) Oh, no. Not him again. I feel a headache coming on. Actually, it doesn't sound that bad. It is quite pleasant. He must have been practicing. ( all laugh ) - ( water splashing ) - ( indistinct chatter ) Leah. Oh, oh. Whenever you take that tone you are about to say something important. I should listen. Are you not listening all the time? I try. The time has come for me to leave. For a while. Leave? There is a war to be fought. My enemies are legions. I'll come with you. The time is not yet right. The enemy is on the run. There is no place for them to hide. I will prevail in battle. The victory is ours. Leah, will you wait for me? Of course. But... But what? What should I do while I wait? Leah, do you love me? Yes! Then there is much for you to do. Before I return, I must go to my father's palace. There, many rooms are being prepared for you. - For me? - Yes. For you. I will return. I promise. Now, go. Your duty calls. ( laughs ) We got one, Brute. Lets see what we got. Oh. Hi guys. Nice trap. Very inventive. You've got to be kidding me. If we didn't have bad luck, we'd have no luck at all. Luck? I'd call it providence. Yeah, you would. Gentlemen, we need to talk. Talk? Yes, I have work for you. Work? You mean like a job? Sort of. Here, kill us now. Come on. The day is fading. Let's go. ( chattering ) The battle awaits. Yes it does, Dunamis. You know what to do. Dybbuk! I know you are near. Come into the light. Dybbuk: But, I do my best work from the shadows. My victory is at hand. ( Dybbuk laughs ) Victory? You call the life of one wretched girl a victory? There is great rejoicing in the Kingdom over her, as there is over each and every one who is subject to the throne. Dybbuk: The battle, such as it was, is yours. But the war goes on. ( grunting ) It looks like it's time for reinforcements. I never come to a fight alone. Nor do I. ( all yelling ) ( grunts ) ( swords clanging ) ( woman vocalizing ) ( creaking ) ( hammer pounding ) Look, Leah, look! Nicely done! ( pounding continues ) You finished your first bench! My second! My first. Oh. Maybe reinforce the legs. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. - Excuse me. - Ma'am. Help me? Please. Will someone please help me? I'll help you. Who are you? Leah. I can't give you your eyes, but I can be your eyes. I would like that. ( woman vocalizing ) - Hey. - Hey. - Ah. - Magistrate. Good morning, my dear. And how is Nod's finest citizen today? Quite well. And you? All the better for having seen you, my dear. Might His Excellency have time to have dinner with an old friend this evening? A meal? Well, I suppose I could eat a little something. - ( giggles ) - See you then. ( woman vocalizing ) ...the prince told the peasant girl that he loved her and that one day he would return for her and take her to live in his palace. Did he return? Not yet, but he will. What do you think about that? ( woman vocalizing ) Doctor, who is that woman? Her name is Leah. - A nurse? - Not officially. She comes here once a week to help. If there's something that needs to be done or someone that needs help, you will find, her, Leah of Nod. Here, let me help you. Oh, thank you. Please, something for the poor? Thank you, Leah. Dybbuk. You look surprised to see me. Not really. My, my, you have changed. You are so old. Weak. You were always quick with a compliment. I call it like I see it. No, Dybbuk. You call it like you want everyone else to see it. It must be difficult. Living alone, holding tight to that long ago promise that someone will return for you. Return to what's left of you. I am here, Leah. I'm not a dream. Come with me. Leave me, Dybbuk. I am never alone. You are. Ah. ( woman vocalizing ) ( knock on door ) Oh. Come in. May I help you? Yes, if you can, please, we're hungry. You are welcome here. Your table is full. Yes, but there is always room for three more. Come, sit. - Thank you. - Thank you. ( woman vocalizing ) ( grunts ) A dance? Why, thank you, my lord. ( crying ) ( sighs ) ( exhales ) ( giggles ) ( sighing ) ( music playing ) - Taker! - Hello, my dear. Come, come, come. Leah. Oh, it's so good to see you. Leah, Leah, look. I can see. You can see. And you are a beautiful sight. Yes, yes she is. Papa. Hello, my little princess. Welcome home.
