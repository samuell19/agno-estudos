Come on, what can Sachin do? He's not a good player. He can't play a single good shot. - Hey, Shiva! - Hey, Abdul! Sachin, Sachin! Sachin, Sachin! - Sachin, Sachin! - Stop screaming Sachin's name. - But why Abdul? - Look over there. The big guys are watching. They will have a problem. I'll chop that Sachin's legs off and hand them over to him. You bloody Sachin Tendulkar fan! Indian Dog! He'll hit a six against us? Let's teach him a lesson. You bastard. You Indian dog. Say Long Live Pakistan, Death to Hindustan! Come on, say it. Say it! Say it! - Say Long Live Pakistan! - Abdul! - Abdul! - Say Long Live Pakistan! Come on, say it! - Say it. - Abdul! Say it, you bastard! - Abdul! Abdul! - Let him go! Come on, say it. Run, Shiva! Come on, run! Stop! Where are you running? You bloody dog. You know how bad the Situation. Why did you step outside your house? She has a very high fever. Go tell your husband to run away from Kashmir and leave you here. And this Hindu girl... I'll marry her to my younger brother. Don't touch her! Convert! Run! Or Die! Convert! Run! Or Die! Convert! Run! Or Die! Muslims wake up, infidels run away! Muslims wake up, infidels run away! If you want to live in Kashmir, you will have to say Allah is the greatest! If you want to live in Kashmir, you will have to say Allah is the greatest! Allah is the greatest! Allah is the greatest! Run, Shiva! I rock your cradle which swings like my long earring. I rock your cradle which swings like my long earrings. Krishna... Krishna. I shall give my life for you. O' my dear, Your cradle swings like my long earrings. I shall give my life for you. O' my dear, Your cradle swings like my long earrings. Why hasn't Father come back yet? Shiva was supposed to come back with him. They must be stuck because of the procession. God knows when their processions will end. Find out if Abdul is back. He had left with Shiva. Brother. Yes? Is Abdul back? He had gone to play cricket with Shiva. I thought they are supposed to return with your father. I have called him. What's going on, Brother? I think the situation is going to get worse. You should leave for a few days. Leave? How can we just leave our home and go? Don't worry about it. I'll take care of your house. When you come back... This won't last for long. Just a couple of days at the most. Let me know when Abdul comes back. Run, Shiva! The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! Kashmir will become Pakistan! Kashmir will become Pakistan! Kashmir will become Pakistan! Kashmir will become Pakistan! Kashmir will become Pakistan! Kashmir will become Pakistan! Kashmir will become Pakistan! Om! Om! Master, I think we'll have to stop the rehearsal. The situation is quite tense. Maha Shivratri takes place in March. I have seen many such processions come and go. Nobody will disturb us. They have that much sense! Om! Hello? Who? Mr. Pushkar Nath? - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! Allah is the greatest! - What do we want? - Freedom! This country is ours! If this is our country, Then tell me, who will rule over it? We will! We will! We will! Who will fight in its war for freedom? We will! We will! We will! If we want to fight the war for freedom, our people should know who our enemy is! India! India! India! Who has enslaved us? India! India! India! There is only one way to teach India a lesson. There is only one solution to the Kashmir problem. Holy Jihad! Holy Jihad! Shiva! - Grandpa! - Shiva! Grandpa! Where were you? I was so scared. The sacrifice of martyrs won't go in vain! The sacrifice of martyrs won't go in vain! We will unfurl the flag of our religious reign! We will unfurl the flag of our religious reign. Wake up! Wake up! It is already dawn: Wake up! Wake up! It is already dawn: Russia has already been defeated! Russia has already been defeated! India is under attack! India is under attack! Now Kashmir will rise! Now Kashmir will rise! Now freedom will soon be ours! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Where are you going? Habba Kadal? Follow us. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. They're here. Terrorists. - I'll go see. - No, no, no. You won't. You go hide in the rice-drum. You want me to hide like a coward? Listen! Like a clever man. No! He's not upstairs! I am telling you the truth! He's gone to Jammu! I am telling you the truth! I swear, I told you the truth! He has gone to Jammu! He is not there! I told you the truth! He is not there! I told you the truth! He is not there! I told you the truth! Let go! You Hindu woman! Have mercy on us please. Please spare us. Please show us mercy. Have mercy on us please. Have mercy on us please. Have mercy on us please. Have mercy on us please. Have mercy on us please. Have mercy on us please. Oh mother! Have mercy... don't kill us please! Bloody Indian spy. Indian Dog! Forgive us, mercy... don't kill us please! Freedom! Forgive us, mercy... Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Oh mother! I am devastated. Oh mother, I am devastated! Father... I am devastated! What have you done? Let her go, kill me instead! Father! Let my daughter-in-law go, kill me instead! We won't kill you, Pandit. Someone needs to be left behind to cry.. No! Hail Lord Shiva! Bastard! If you want to stay in Kashmir, you have to say Allah is the Greatest. Father! I bear witness that there is no deity but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. Aren't you Farooq Malik Bitta, my student? I was your teacher. I've taught you, what the hell are you doing to me? Hey Pandit. Bitta is no longer your student. Call me Area Commander Farooq Janab! Farooq Janab. Address him as Area Commander Farooq Janab, you Hindu! Father! Father! Please leave father, kill me instead. Let him go. Please. Please leave father, kill me instead. But what is our fault? Why are you doing this to us? What's wrong with you guys? Fine. I'll spare all your lives. If you eat this rice. (Baby Krishna crying) Take this. Hello. Yes, wait there. He will come. What's wrong? The flight didn't land? It has landed. So, he wasn't on it? He will come. His baggage must have been delayed. Are you sure he boarded from Delhi? Yes, he did. He had messaged me. Why haven't the others come? They should have reached by now. How long does it take from Jammu? They will come as well. They are coming by road. It can get late sometimes. Everything will be fine. You should get ready. Hari Narain. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good. - Hello, Laxmi! - Hello, Vishnu. You still look the same. People who work for the media do not change on the outside. Hmm. And where do policemen change from? I think the doctor will know. Hello, Laxmi. Hello. Dr. Mahesh. You look fine. Thank you. Has he come? His flight has landed. Our driver's waiting at the airport. Where's Brahma? Listen guys, let's make a rule. We won't talk about our past in front of him. No politics either. And no Kashmir. I understand politics... but why no Kashmir? What's the difference? So, no mention of exodus? No. Not exodus... Genocide. Look who's here. Look who's here. Krishna. Please sit down. Why are you guys standing? Not for you. For Pushkar. We will have to leave early tomorrow. There's curfew in Habba Kadal after 7 o'clock. Okay. We'll leave for Jammu from there itself. Hmm. Thank you. You plan to stay here for a couple of days, right? No. Actually, I have to meet a couple of people tomorrow. And I'm going back day after tomorrow. So soon? I have some important work in Delhi, day after tomorrow. You could have stayed and seen Kashmir. Maybe next time. But I'd like to visit the place of my parents' accident. Why? What happened? This is your first time in Kashmir? He was born here. I know. How will he remember anything? He was just a baby back then. I remember most of my childhood. Honestly, I don't remember anything. I am sure Pushkar must have told you something. I mean what all happened and-- We decided no politics. This isn't politics. I just want to know what you know about Kashmir. That's all. Kashmir has never been an integral part of India and this is a historical fact. In fact, there was condition laid down for Kashmir's accession with India, That a plebiscite was supposed take place as soon as the situation normalizes. It means a people's vote. Did the plebiscite ever take place? - No! - Never! - Free Kashmir! - Free Kashmir! - Free Kashmir! - Free Kashmir! If political parties have a right to have their own flags, then why don't Kashmiris? If India can fight with Britain for its independence then why can't Kashmir? If Bhagat Singh is celebrated then why isn't Burhan Wani? Long live, Burhan Wani! Long live, Burhan Wani! Today the world believes that we have illegally occupied Kashmir. If you pick any leading international newspapers like Newsweek, New York Times, Washington Post... or pick any important document of any powerful country for that matter. Kashmir isn't included in their map of India Because the world believes that Kashmir is not a part of India. The Indian army makes an entire village stand outside on a cold winter night, in the name of cordon-and-search. Children, old people, pregnant women, no one is spared. Shame! Terrorists like Abu Salem and Kasab get special treatment for years And Afzal Guru wasn't even allowed to meet his family. Afzal, we apologise! For your killers are still alive! Afzal, we apologise! For your killers are still alive! Kids of Kashmir grow up without fathers. They still survive with the hope that their father will return one day. And when this kid raises a question they call him a terrorist! Now if this kid won't throw stones, will he shower you with flowers? And when you start talking against this fascism, The so-called "Nationalists" will troll you on social media. They will call you a traitor. They will say things like, "go to Pakistan". But don't worry, I'm not going to Pakistan. In fact, I'm not going anywhere. Exactly like this country. Our team has researched at these five places: Kupwara, Baramula, Bandipora, Poonch and Rajouri. And we found even more than 7000 mass graves here. Professor Menon? You can call me Radhika. What about Batta Mazar? What is Batta Mazar? The place where 100,000 Kashmiri Hindus were drowned in Dal Lake. There were seven piles of the just the sacred thread gathered from the dead. The place where they were cremated is known as Batta Mazar. Sit down, man. - You know... - Saying the truth-- You'll make a very good politician someday, Oh, thank you ma'am. No one knows who these 7000 graves belong to. But we know that if today's students don't raise their voice for Kashmir Then one day Kashmir too will become a big unmarked grave. We will get Kashmir out of this darkness. We will get our Freedom from them! - What do we want? - Freedom! - In one voice! - Freedom! - Louder! - Freedom! - We want Freedom from federalism! - Freedom! - We want Freedom from Hindu ideologies! - Freedom! - We will get our Freedom from them! - Freedom! - It is our right! - Freedom! - We'll snatch it away! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - India, you will break into pieces! - Inshallah! Inshallah! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Freedom! - Ma'am. - Oh, it's you again. Sorry, I didn't mean any disrespect. You spoke about Kashmir. But you forgot to mention that 4,000 Kashmiri Pandits had died there. Not 4,000, 219 was the official figure. That's because no one reported the truth. No one? Administration, historians, intellectuals, media, professors. - You mean they are all against you? - Right. - Since the past 30 years? - Absolutely. - Is that true? - Yes, it is. Tell me who was the greatest Kashmiri leader? Sheikh Abdullah. It was Lalitaditya. A Hindu King. He ruled most of India. We all think that we know the truth. But we don't. What if what you have believed to be the truth since The past 30 years is not true at all? What's your name? Krishna Pandit. Ah, Pandit. Now I understand. Upper caste privilege! Pandit, huh? That's not fair, ma'am. I don't believe in the caste system. I believe in equality and justice. Really? Then I want you to scream "Freedom" out loud. Is the Pandit coming in your way? Come on, scream. Come on, don't be inhibited. I said, scream. Freedom! There you are. Tomorrow's headline will state that this was Krishna Pandit's scream. Now think about that child in Kashmir, his voice doesn't have a name. He'll always be known as an Islamic terrorist. Try listening to the scream of someone Who doesn't have an identity. Try being his voice. And you will know what Kashmir and its truth is all about. Freedom. Freedom. Sochzal Waangan, Muj Chetin, Nadru Yakhni, Dum Aloo, and Monj Haakh Oh lovely, I'm getting to enjoy Kashmiri food after a long time. I've also cooked Kashmiri food after a long time. It looks delicious. Please help yourselves. Smells good. But sorry, I have never heard of these dishes before. Your mother Sharda used to make the best Kashmiri food. It was a ritual. Every Sunday we used to have dinner at your place. You know we perhaps wouldn't have been such good friends with Pushkar, if not for your mother's cooking. Right, Brahma? That's why no one spoke to him in the past 30 years. Please. Here you go. Looking interesting. What is this? Nadru. How can you not know Nadru being a Kashmiri? It is believed that the one who doesn't know about Nadru, Doesn't truly know about Kashmir. Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayyed's daughter Rubaiyya Sayeed... ...was kidnapped by JKLF. Prime Minister has called for a high-level meeting. It is believed that the Indian Government might give in to the terrorist's demands. Ask the Home Minister if Rubaiyya's security is Central Government's responsibility Then isn't it also their duty to protect the people of Kashmir from terrorists and corruption? Till when will they keep having such double standards? What brings you here? I heard rumours that they've included my son's name in the hit list. He has been declared as an Indian spy. I went to the police station. They said they cannot provide security to everyone. It seems more than half of us are on their hit list. Can you provide the security? Come on, man. It's my duty. I'll arrange for your security at the earliest. Thank you. It's good to have IAS officers as friends. Come, let me drop you home. Driver, can you please pull over here? - Let me buy some Nadru for Laxmi. - Hey, come on! Let it be. Just get down. How much for Nadru? 28 rupees per kilo. Have you gone crazy? Lessen the price. The price is set. - He won't bring the price down. - Wait, let me pay. You can pay the day you start speaking Kashmiri. Take these. 100 rupees What are you doing? You're giving me a Jinnah instead of Gandhi. He's giving me a Pakistani note. Janab, you'll get the currency of the country you stay in. What did you say? Which country? There is only one country. India! Don't you feel ashamed betraying your nation? Hey! Come here. Take him away. Arrest me if you want. But from tomorrow, you'll only get vegetables if you pay in our currency. And from 26th January, the market will be held in Islamabad! Al Safa says get out Pandits! - Al Safa says get out Pandits! - What is he saying? Sir, it means Kashmiri Pandits run away. Don't throw it away. Sir! Sir! What are you doing? Why are you throwing the food? We won't let these infidels eat our grains. We won't! We won't! We won't! Then what will we eat! Sir, you had come to my college, you had given me a certificate too. I am a Gold Medalist, sir. They have stopped selling groceries to us, sir. Pandits are being killed if they open their shops. We are out of food, sir! The grocery that's meant for us is taken away by these women, sir. Our people are dying, sir. They refuse us treatment in the hospitals. And now they are stopping our food supply. Please do something, sir. Who will help us if not you, sir? Al Safa says run away Kashmiri Pandits! We have received an intelligence report that something is about to go very wrong. Tika Lal Taploo was shot dead in the market. Taploo was the most popular leader after Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. Both Razdan and Bhan were intelligence officers. JKLF's commander Bitta killed them in broad daylight. What can be worse than that? Their goal is to end all Kashmiri Hindu leadership. I interviewed some people, Downtown. They believe... they will soon have Freedom. Uncle, you seem to know everything. Why don't you telecast it? My job is to record the interviews and forward them. It's not my job to telecast it. Then why do you call yourself a journalist? Call yourself a postman. Showing fake news is not as harmful as hiding the truth. Why don't you just say you don't have the courage? We are all just trying to stay alive in Kashmir. And there is nothing more courageous than staying alive, Pushkar Nath. - Do you get that? - Father? - Yes? - Here, take the Nadru-Monj - What about the tea? - It's coming too. Bring tea for all of them Why don't you talk to the Chief Minister? You are a Divisional Commissioner. It is a big post. The Chief Minister? If he gets a break from playing golf and Giving bike rides to Bollywood heroines. Why don't you talk to the Prime Minister? He is a youth leader. You think I haven't tried? What did he say? He said, "I know that the situation in Kashmir is quite tense." "But I cannot interfere. The CM is my friend. He will get offended." So, the country can burn down but the friendship should stay intact. It's been going on since 1947. This Friendship-Before-Nation policy. Who sowed these seeds? Mr. Sheikh. There is a saying about him. He is a Nationalist in Delhi, A Communist in Jammu and Communalist in Kashmir. That's the definition of a Secularist. The Indian Government is ignoring Kashmir like it was never a part of the country. Sir! They just killed a judge! Which judge? - Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! - Srinagar High Court Judge, Neelkanth Ganjoo has been shot dead in broad daylight at Hari Singh Market by terrorists. The JKLF has claimed responsibility for it. JKLF was formed by Maqbool Bhat. Who robbed a bank and killed its manager, hijacked and blew up an Indian Airlines Plane, and killed CID officer Amar Chand. Justice Ganjoo had found him guilty and had sentenced him to death. Good morning, Mr. Dutt. - Good morning, Mr. - Good morning. - Good morning, officers. - Bye. Let's go. Bye, darling. Hi! - How are you? - I am fine. Want a plane? Yes. I've got something for you. This is for you. Want to fly? Take this. Thank you. Welcome. Oh, that's for me? - Yes. - Thank you so much. So beautiful. God bless you. Bye-bye. Bye. What are you waiting for? Get them! From every city only one slogan will rise! Freedom! From every village only one slogan will rise! Freedom! From every mosque only one slogan will rise! Freedom! From every school only one slogan will rise! Freedom! Every other kid will scream, Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Hello, Mr. Brahma Dutt. Tell me. Sir, the situation is really bad. The DGP is aware of this. An attack on our Air Force Officers is an attack on our Government. Kashmiri Pandits are being identified and targeted. JKLF has issued an open threat. "Kashmir Pandits leave Kashmir." It's just a drama. I know their game plan. This isn't a drama, sir. It's a fact. They are burning Indian flags. They have put Pakistani flags on Lal Chowk. So? Why don't you do something about it? What should we do, sir? The Central Government refuses to respond to any of my requests. Your office overrules all my decisions. JKLF openly gets help from your Party Office. Are you here lobbying for them? Sir, you want to run a government by dividing the population? This is a war on our civilisation. A Jihad against India's ancient heritage. Pakistani sympathisers are orchestrating this war against India both from Indian and Pakistani grounds. And our Government is helping them succeed. This is Kashmir. We are Independent. We have our constitution here. Our culture. Our flags. We will do what we want to do. And Mr. Brahma Dutt, I think you have come here as an Indian spy. That's why I am snatching all your powers. You... are suspended. Speak out! Your words are free. Raise your voice! Speak up! Your tongue is still your own. Raise your voice! Your body remains yours ramrod, erect. Raise your voice! Speak out! Your life is still your own. Raise your voice! Your body remains yours ramrod, erect. Raise your voice! Speak out! Your life is still your own. Raise your voice! The short time left to you is enough. Raise your voice! Speak out! Your life is still your own. Raise your voice! Come, I need to talk to you. Krishna, I hope you understand That you are contesting for Student Council President's post? - Hmm? - Yep. It's not some junior post. It is a matter of prestige. The media will be following this election closely. And you have to win. We don't have a choice. Yes, ma'am. - I'm trying my level best. - No, you're not. You are not giving your best. You are unable to connect with our students. Don't be impressed by this sloganeering. Most of the students are still suspicious about you. Suspicious about me? But why? Because most of our voters are Kashmiri Muslims. And you are a Pandit. It's not like I like to quote this again and again, But this an electoral reality. But ma'am, we cannot stay divided forever. Isn't there a solution for this? There is. There is a solution. But you will have to make a choice, whether you want to stand with the problem or the solution. The solution. Good. People believe in God? Yes. They don't believe in him because he comes down helps them. People believe in God because they have this hope That one day God will do something for them. And this hope, is God! You have to become their God. You have to become their Messiah. I'm nobody's God, ma'am. For God's sake, please. I don't have any solution either. That's the best part, Krishna. You don't need to provide a solution. You just need to give them the hope that there is some solution. But there isn't one. You're so naive, Krishna. Just treat politics like it's a story. If there is a hero in it then it also needs a villain. Who is the villain of your story? - Terrorism. - Why does terrorism exist? Because of oppression. Who is the oppressor? State. Exactly. Which is Government of India. Understood? Blaming terrorism won't help. Pin it on the Government. You will get the power only if you make Government your villain. The power to negotiate better. That's extortion ma'am, not negotiation. That's politics. You can change the fate of this country only if you have this power. Political power. Everything else is rubbish. Now go and try harder. You must win. Grandpa, I told you to stop doing charity. Why don't you listen to me? I won't die until they remove Article 370. You can't even see properly. What if you meet with an accident? What will we do? Enough about me. Now let's talk about you. You have started hiding everything from me. What did I hide? I met Mr. Kaul. He said you made the headlines. You are running for Student's President at ANU. You were shouting slogans of Freedom. You are being prosecuted for sedition. Is it true? So now you'll fight for our enemies, huh? How long do you plan on carrying forward this hate? Can't you forgive them? Say sorry to each other and move on. Say sorry and move on? Say sorry to those responsible for our genocide? Come on grandpa, it was not a genocide. Please. I just don't understand till when you guys plan to carry this fake label? You guys? Who are you? I don't believe in any identities. But you believe in the identity responsible for killing Kashmiri Pandits! They died because of their own mistake. This is bound to happen if you oppress the minorities. They aren't a minority, we are. 2% minority. Minority amongst minorities. We are being treated as refugees in our own country since the past 30 years. We are not refugees! We are not minorities! We are Kashmiri Pandits from Kashmir! This land belongs to us! We have a right over it! Grandpa, at least let me finish cutting your nails. We were 100% before they came. They converted us. We can proudly list our ancestors all the way back to 25 generations. Can they do that? Even their surnames belong to us! Kaul, Pandit, Bhatt, Mattoo. Our Kashmir is the land of Gods and Saints. Our Kashmir is the land where Shankaracharya meditated. Our Kashmir is the land where the Panchtantra was penned down. What do you even know about Kashmir? I know enough. You have been telling me stories of Kashmir ever since I was a kid. Have you ever given this a thought? If Kashmiri Pandits had such a glorious history... Then why did they convert? Because they were terrorised! Through the swords of the Sufis. You will only concentrate on your studies. No politics. Politics has only one end... destruction. Death. So you want the fear of death to make me a coward? I feel very cold. I feel very cold. Bring me a kangri, please. It's freezing cold. Sorry, grandpa. It has snowed in Habba Kadal. See. Oh snow fall please, Oh brother come please. Oh snow... bring me a blanket, I am shivering. Oh snow... See it has snowed in Baramulla too. Also, in Shankaracharya. I am shivering. I am feeling cold. Grandpa. You won't get into politics. Oh snow fall please... Oh brother come please. Oh snow fall please. It's quite cold. Drinks? I'm impressed. It's been 30 years and you still remember my favourite whiskey? I appreciate it. Tell me when. That's it. Okay. Vishnu? Awesome. My Rum. I thought you wouldn't remember. Doctor? No, I must avoid. We are getting together after 30 years. We should have at least one token drink. Okay. I'll have one. With soda and-- Bitters? Anything for you, young man? No sir, thanks. I'm good. It's Durga. Calling from US. - She wants to say hello. - Oh. Remember him? Oh my God, she's grown up. Hi, Mahesh uncle. Where are you now? I'm in DC. Where are you now? I'm in Houston. We must meet up. I am sure you'll recognise him. Hi, kiddo. Hi, Hari uncle. Hello! Remember me? - Toffee uncle! - Right! Good, good. Hey! Cheers, Dad. Thank you. And that's Krishna. - Who? - Thank you. Remember Pushkar uncle's grandson Shiva? He's his younger brother. - Hi, Krishna. How are you? - Hello. I am sorry to hear about Pushkar uncle. That's okay. And I have so many fond memories of Shiva. We used to play a lot in the snow. I miss him a lot. - Life was unfair to him. - Cheers. Can you believe this? One accident took my entire family away from me. What? Accident? Yeah, why? Can I talk to Mom? Sure. Mom? What? Durga, I am sorry I didn't inform you. I didn't get a chance. Let's talk tomorrow, okay? Okay. See you. Bye. Ma'am? Why was your daughter so shocked to hear about the accident? Well, she doesn't know what happened here after January 1990. Do you have any pictures of my parents? Yes, I do. Pushkar used to dress up as Lord Shiva for Maha Shivratri. Look. Which one of them are my parents? Sharda. Your Dad. And Shiva. Pushkar never told you? No. He had said he left this place empty-handed during the exodus. He couldn't take anything along. Almost everyone left empty-handed during the exodus. Some had to run with just one shoe on. Stop, Doctor! Stop. When 500,000 Pandits were killed and made to run away, That is not an exodus, it's a genocide. Sorry sir, it was not a genocide, please. Oh really? What was it then? Tell me. Come on, tell me. I would call it dirty politics. And the fact is that only 200,000 Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir. And the unfortunate ones who died were killed by Pakistani militants and not Kashmiris. Why should Kashmiris suffer for it? Oh. So, Farooq Malik Bitta is a Pakistani terrorist? He was your grandfather Pushkar's student. Right. So just imagine... Who turned these students into terrorists? What else do you expect when innocent boys are dragged behind cars and blamed for rape, huh? What do you expect these tortured people to do? You expect them to worship us instead of picking up guns? No, sir. This is what will happen. Tortured people, huh? Kashmiri Pandits never Picked up a gun. Why? So, what happened on the night of 19th January? My father died in a scooter accident. He wasn't murdered! If what you are saying is true, then why didn't my grandpa tell me about it? They were my parents! Broken souls don't speak. They must be heard. Was my mother murdered as well? If, yes, then where is my brother Shiva? Why didn't he try to contact me? Hmm? Either me or grandpa? All of you know everything. Except me. What is the truth? Please tell me the truth. Was my mother killed and thrown into the Jhelum River? Or did they kidnap her and take her to Pakistan? What's the truth? Indian agents! Indian spies! If you don't leave, we'll set your houses on fire. This is your last warning. Leave! Only Islamic Law will be followed in Kashmir henceforth! Inshallah! Kashmir needs to be repopulated as Pakistan with Hindu women, without their men. Leave your wives behind, infidels! Kashmir will be made Pakistan. Without Hindu men, with Hindu women. Inshallah! The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! Convert, leave or die! Convert, leave or die! Convert, leave or die! Convert, leave or die! Convert, leave or die! - The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! - He's not upstairs. The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! The great slogan is Allah is the greatest! Oh mother! Pandit, if you hadn't been my teacher. And if she wouldn't have been your daughter-in-law... Then I would have married her. At least one infidel would have been converted. (Baby Krishna crying) Save my child, Doctor! Save my child, Doctor! - Hello? - Terrorists have shot my son. Come here with an ambulance right away. Save my son. Bandage his bullet wound with a piece of cloth. How many bullet wounds should I bandage? I'll fall short of clothes trying to bandage them all. Come here with an ambulance immediately. Yes, yes, Pushkar. I'm coming. I'm coming. Wrap him with clothes. He is still breathing. Doctor! He needs blood. O Negative. We haven't received a supply of blood in a few days. Then get it from someplace else. O Negative is a rare blood group. - With the curfew going on-- - Then use a patient's blood. How can he use a patient's blood? Sir! I am O Negative. My blood group is O Negative. I have started the blood transfusion. Your brother will survive. Listen carefully. India's illegal occupation over Kashmir ends today. Only Allah's followers will live on this holy land here henceforth. Who will get to live here? Allah's followers! Who will get to live here? Allah's followers! What are you doing? What are you doing? I have given him enough blood. I will decide when he has had enough blood. What are you doing? He will die. Your Army has shot at my brother. They should know: We will kill two for every bullet they shoot at us. Allah's decree: No doctors or nurses will treat infidels. Who will they not treat? Infidels! - Whose decree is this? - Allah's! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! - What do we want? - Freedom! We have just learnt that Jammu and Kashmir's Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah has resigned. As you all know the situation in Kashmir is very tense. On one hand there is religious tension and on the other hand... This is so ironic. Kashmir is believed to be heaven on Earth. But the people who are turning it into hell are doing so to ensure their place in heaven. It's all going to end, Laxmi. India is slowly losing Kashmir. Hello? My son has died, Brahma Dutt. They have asked us to leave Kashmir overnight. Not just us, there are 500,000 more Kashmir Pandits. Don't worry. I'll do something. You won't do anything, Brahma Dutt. Even you are one of them. When India will burn like Kashmir someday Remember that you too had a hand in it. I promise you. You will get justice. What is... justice? Hello? Hello, Mr. Krishnan? What's wrong? No officer or minister is taking my calls. Are they on leave or are they scared? Kashmir is on fire! Kashmiri Pandits are being massacred in the streets! Ask the Home Minister to send the planes, otherwise by tomorrow-- I had personally given you orders to protect Pushkar's family. Then how did this happen? Sir, we had orders from you and from Commander Bitta. You tell us, whose order should we have followed? You are fired! Sir, they have left. Kashmir will become Pakistan, without Hindu Men, with Hindu Women! Kashmir will become Pakistan, without Hindu Men, with Hindu Women! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! Convert! Leave! Or die! I am taking you to Anand Kaul Premi's place. He's a poet. He's friends with the Muslims. He has often helped them. A lot of families have sought refuge at his place. Look at how my Kashmir is burning. You are reporting all this, aren't you? You are reporting all this, aren't you? Everyone in India should know what we are going through. Everyone will join in to support us once they learnt about it. They all left me. You are the only one I can trust. You will report all this, won't you? It's a matter of a few days only, Therefore, don't carry all of your stuff. Our first priority must be to protect the honour of our womenfolk. We will come back. All these murderers will be punished for their crimes. The Pakistani flag at Lal Chowk... This child will remove it and hoist India's flag there. Our flag, your flag, my flag. Once again Kashmir will resound with the echoes of... Hail... India! Shush! Hail India! Hail India! Hail India! Stay silent. Don't make any sound, let me see who that is. Don't worry. I have written many poems on them. They consider me their own, don't worry. They consider me as one of their own. All girls come with me to the attic. Let's hide there. Hurry up. Let's go. Hurry up. Farooq Bitta? Hello, Mr. Kaul. Hi. The situation outside is very bad. I'd advise you to come with us. We'll take you to a safe place. But where? You don't worry. We'll bring you back as soon as it's safe. Father, you can't see properly at night. Let me come with you. With pleasure. Two is better than one. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Let's go, Mr. Kaul. Come on, let's go. - Militants! Militants! Militants! - Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Having snatched my heart you have gone far off, Come, my love, my flowery Cupid. Let us go, my friend, to gather Basil. Wounding my heart with an axe, He disdains to even inquire of me. - Come, my love, my flowery Cupid. - Mom, I am hungry. Mom, I am hungry. Having snatched my heart you have gone far off, Come, my love, my flowery Cupid! Mom, I need to pee. Stop the truck, please. Driver, stop the truck please! Driver, stop the truck. I need to pee. Come with me. Come here. Come with me, dear. Come, be careful. Give me the box. - Do you have the Shawl? - Yes, here. Don't worry. Remove your pajama and sit. No one look. Having snatched my heart you have gone far off, Come, my love, my flowery Cupid! Let us go my friend to gather herbs. Heartless people make fun of me. That's Mr. Koul and his son! The ones who are being called victims were actually the privileged Pandits of Kashmir. While Pandits were a minority in Kashmir, They had the sole right over government jobs, financial aids and social benefits. As a result, Kashmiri Muslims, the majority, faced atrocities and oppression. And it is because of the monopoly of the Pandits... The gap between rich Pandits and poor Muslims widened. When the educated youth of Kashmir protested about it... The Pandit's monopoly crumpled and they decided to leave Kashmir. This is Vishnu Ram reporting live, from Kashmir. Back to the Studio. Pushkar was right. Reporting fake news is not as dangerous as hiding the truth. I agree. If the news can be faked, you can only imagine what they have done with our history. Absolutely. Why didn't you report the truth? Ask him. Sir, I am asking you a question. Why didn't you show the world what was actually happening in Kashmir? I didn't have the means. We didn't have these TV Channels that you have now. There was no social media either. Then how does everyone know about Babri Masjid? Delhi Sikh Massacre? Bhopal Gas Tragedy? How do people know about that? These things happened back in 1984. Six years before 1990! The market is always open for those who are ready to be sold. Market? What do you mean? What are you trying to say? Just come out with it. I should know what you are talking about. Krishna, you know, when we police officers want to arrest a hard-core criminal we first find out who his mistress is. Do you know who goes in bed with the terrorists? It's them, the media. You are crossing your limits, okay? You wanted me to come out with it, right? So here you go. The media always addresses IS and Al-Qaeda as 'Islamist Terrorists'. But the Kashmiri terrorists of Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen and JKLF are addressed as Rebels not Terrorists. Even though IS, Al-Qaeda and all the other terrorist organisations... Have the same modus operandi, crime and source of finance. They all have the same aim. They want to break Kashmir away from India... And have it declared as The Islamic Republic of Kashmir. And in this war their invisible army is our media. The day we Indians realise that, people will drag the media out on the street and beat the hell out of them. Before you go pointing fingers at me, tell me something, You too were in a position power back then, weren't you? In fact, you were more powerful than me. Why didn't you do anything? Because you too were in the market to be sold. Where was your courage back then? How dare you! How dare you question my integrity and courage? I fought with the terrorists, alone! They threw a bomb at me! Not you! I am the one who barely escaped death. I didn't get the Padma Shri for no reason. No! The Government gave you the Padma Shri to buy your silence! It is very easy to blame the media. You can say whatever you want. 19! 19 reporters have died in Kashmir so far. Did anyone protect us? Did anyone? Who would protect a traitor? Yes. Who are you calling a traitor, huh? Who are you calling a traitor, huh? You. - How dare you! - You bastard! - You... - You're a bloody snake in the grass. How dare you call me a traitor! - You're a snake in the grass. - How dare you call me a traitor! How dare you call me a traitor! Stop them, sir. - Why aren't you stopping them? - I'll strangle you. They have been holding it back for 30 years. Let it be. I'll strangle you. How dare you call me a traitor! Vishnu! Control yourself. - Why don't you stop them? - Stop it! Don't you dare! This is an Info war, an advanced war, a very dangerous war. It's a war of narratives. You know when the foreign press comes to Kashmir, they first contact the Pakistan sponsored separatist network. They are taken to a separatist location. Where people are paid 500 rupees to tell them stories of victimhood. And you know who they use as their shield? Women and children. After that, they create horrific images using Photoshop. Clickbait headlines. They make an Anti-India, Fascist India, Oppressive India's narrative. A narrative which has nothing to do with history or politics. It requires no home-work. I had come here when Burhan Wani died. You know where they mourned for Burhan Wani? The places where the international press used to be. Camera on, mourning begins. Camera off, mourning stops. The kids who threw stones when the cameras rolled, disappeared as soon as the cameras switched off. The lie travels the world by the time the truth decides to step out. That's why The world doesn't know the true story of Kashmiri Hindus. Jews. You know what they did? They didn't let the world forget what they went through during the holocaust. Why didn't Kashmir Pandits do the same? Why didn't they tell the world what they went through? No one was ready to listen. Right. Mr. Pushkar Nath, you have cataract. We will have to operate. We'll change the lens as well. Which lens would you prefer? What do you mean? We offer free consultation, but you will have to pay for the lens. It will be a discounted rate, of course. There's a cheap one and an expensive one-- I'll take the cheap one. Hear me out. I told you, I want the cheapest one. Why? I can either use my pension to educate my grandson or to buy the expensive lens. You have diabetes. Glaucoma. There are high chances of blindness or partial blindness. What if you lose your eyesight? I'll manage. Education is more important. I want more rice, Mom. No, you shouldn't eat too much rice at night. Your stomach will start aching. - Father? - Yes Have your dinner. I am not hungry. I've noticed you are having only one meal a day. I told you I don't feel hungry in the evenings. Where are you going? I'll sleep outside. Otherwise, he will be disturbed. No, I won't be disturbed. I snore a lot. There are scorpions outside. Scorpions are scared of your grandpa. If I see one then I'll hit it with my slipper like this. Grandpa, you can't even see clearly during the day. How will you spot the scorpions at night? I'll see better than you once I have the operation. Then soon we'll go back to Kashmir. All of us. Me too. Yes, you too. I will travel the whole world, But nothing will be as special to me as you, my dear home. My dear home, how I wish to never step out of your doors. I will travel a thousand miles, But nothing will be as special to me as you, my dear home. We ran away to save our lives. What constellation dawned on us that we had to leave our home. My dear home, I will sacrifice everything for you. How I wish to never step out of your doors. I will travel a thousand miles, Nothing is as special to me as you. My dear home, I will sacrifice everything for you. How I wish to never step out of your doors. I will travel a thousand miles, Nothing is as special to me as you. I will travel a thousand miles, Nothing is as special to me as you. My dear home, I will sacrifice everything for you. How I wish to never step out of your doors. I will travel a thousand miles, Nothing is as special to me as you. Nothing is as special to me as you. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Did any of you meet him after that? It's quite late. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Goodnight. See you tomorrow. I think I've had too much too. We'll call it a day. Goodnight. Goodnight, Laxmi. Goodnight. You never met him again as well? No. I did, once... in Jammu. The Chief Minister resigned on 18th January. The new Governor joined office on 20th January. There was no government in Kashmir for two days. I was made the new Advisor to the Governor. Whether anyone believes it or not... My priority was to bring Kashmiri Pandits back to Kashmir. No one from the Centre ever visited the Jammu Camps. After a lot of requests, Home Minister agreed for a visit. Move aside. Go and wait at where I came from. Good day, sir. The situation is very bad. People are dying from scorpion and snake bites. People are dying from diabetes, sunstroke and hyper-tension. Maximum people suffer from PTSD. Miscarriages, early menopause, abnormal menstrual cycle. All in all, 5,000-6,000 people have died so far. 25-26 people live in a single tent, sir. No one has money for medical treatment. How will they go on like this? And for how long, sir? It looks like they have been left here to die. It's natural. It's so hot out here, anyone will die. This is the first time in 100 generations they have stepped outside of Kashmir's cold climate. Not stepped out, sir. They were thrown out. Now you can come one by one and submit your requests to the Home Minister. Sir, government gives 2 lakh rupees to each terrorist for surrendering. They in turn use that money to buy Kalashnikovs at cheap rates to further kill innocent people Then they again surrender and treat themselves with two lakhs. What does the government give us? 600 rupees. Is that even just? Will our families survive in mere 600 rupees. What is this? We are scattered people. Look at our condition in camps. We live amidst snakes, scorpions, stones. In the cruel heat, we languish in these tents. We don't have any food, any education... In Maharashtra Balasaheb has allotted special quota... For our kids in all the engineering colleges. Why can't the Central Government do this all across India? Enough. Any other requests? I am used to applying Boroline. They don't have any in this camp. Get him some immediately. Okay, sir. One more thing. I have sent more than 100 letters to your Office requesting removal of Article 370 but your office didn't reply to a single letter of mine. Look that is a different issue. I am here to help you. This is the only help I want from you. Remove Article 370 and rehabilitate Kashmiri Pandits. Remove Article 370! Remove Article 370! Remove Article 370! Remove Article 370! Remove Article 370! Remove Article 370! Pushkar? Yes? Pushkar, it's me, Brahma. Remove Article 370 and rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus. Remove Article 370 and rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus. Remove Article 370! Remove Article 370! Remove Article 370 and rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus. Remove Article 370 and rehabilitate Kashmiri Hindus. I have made all the arrangements. You will get a government job at Nadimarg's Council Office. There are a lot of Kashmiri Hindu families residing there. It is absolutely safe. I have had a word with the Council President. You will be staying in his house. You know how stubborn Father is. He will only go back to his own house in Kashmir. When you have to climb Mt. Everest, you have to take one step at a time. I'll try to get him to agree with it. No, you will have to convince him. You have two kids. You cannot ruin their future. Right? You want to go back to Kashmir, right? Right, Shiva? Hurry! Come on, fast. What do you mean the Prime Minister is busy? No, I don't understand. I want his direct number. Okay. I'll call again tomorrow. I told the man at the Prime Minister's office. If he doesn't call me tomorrow, I will go to Delhi myself and talk to him. Hey, you forgot to touch grandpa's feet. We worship Goddess Saraswati, Goddess of Knowledge, Sharda. Your mother's also named Sharda. You should worship her. - When you will have no one - Tell me as well. Yes, son. When you will have no one with you And the darkness will surround you She is the one who will guide you. Okay? Krishna, you should take your grandfather's blessings too. Oh, my darling child! I want to play too. Shiva, why have you jumped in? Come out, you dirty child. You will spoil all your clothes. Why did you jump? Greetings, sir. Greetings. School was off so I thought I'd go and inspect the surroundings. With God's grace everything is running smoothly. Hello. Hello. Shiva. Maulvi sir, I wanted to discuss something important with you. I am at your service. Our kids need to learn science. Why don't they teach science in our school? Let's not talk about the school. Let's talk about you instead. Nowadays, the situation is bad. You should marry me. Both you and your children will get protection. Hello. This is Vishnu Ram Our special guest for tonight is Farooq Malik Bitta. This is a very bad man. People have a lot to say about you. After all who is Farooq Malik Bitta? Freedom fighter. You have been accused of killing many Kashmiri Pandits. Yes. How many have you killed? I don't remember. 20, maybe 25. Who was the first person you murdered? Satish. Satish who? Satish Kumar Tickoo. Who was he? A Pandit boy. So, you killed him because he was a Pandit? He worked for the RSS. So, it is a crime to work for the RSS? Yes. The people you killed included your neighbours, friends and teachers. What about the Air Force killings? Two innocent women died in that incident. We are talking about a war here. And everything's fair when it comes to war. He has managed to reach Delhi. He will soon make his way to the Prime Minister as well. What if they'd asked you to kill your brother? I would have killed him. And if they'd asked you to kill your mother? You would have killed her as well? I would have. Repeat after me, kids. - This is Kashmir. - This is Kashmir. - We are Kashmiris. - We are Kashmiris. Kashmir's neighbouring countries are... Afghanistan. China and Pakistan. China and Pakistan. And? India! The council President will be paying us a visit today. What will you say if he asks you what you want in this village? Masjid! What will you say? Masjid! Say it. What do we want? Masjid! What do we want? - Masjid! - What do we want? Masjid! Your mom told me you didn't eat your food today! Why? I don't want to go to school. Why don't you want to go to school? I'm scared. What is my boy scared of? Of what's written on the wall of our school. What's written on the wall of your school? Raliv, Galiv, Chaliv. What do you think Raliv, Galiv, Chaliv means? Either convert to Islam, or die or flee. You are wrong. Raliv, Galiv, Chaliv means: Oh fear! Either become my strength. Or die. Or flee. What does it mean? Oh fear! Either become my strength. Or die. Or flee. Repeat after me. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave. Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Convert, die or leave! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! What they do can't be called Kashmiriyat. Kashmiriyat is what our children are doing. Freedom from hatred. Freedom is no longer just a slogan. It's a mantra. - We want Freedom from federalism! - Freedom! - We want Freedom from Hindu ideologies! - Freedom! They want Freedom from India. Freedom is a song of terrorism. Afzal, we apologise! Just like chanting Om creates vibrations inside you, The word 'Freedom' awakens the revolutionary inside you. Freedom is our right! They kept chanting "Freedom" when they were shooting at our children. Do anything you want... But never support the ones who shout slogans of Freedom. - What do we want? - Freedom! Freedom is a symbol. It's an anthem of Free Kashmir... Exactly like the Jana Gana Mana of India. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! It's happening. You might not see it, but it's happening. The Prime Minister will write to me when they remove Article 370. He'll write: "Mr. Pushkar Nath Pandit, grandfather of Mr. Krishna Pandit." "We have noted all your 6000 letters." "We declare that you are no longer a migrant." "You can go back to Kashmir." Dreams don't just come true. You have to chase them. We won't fly there. We'll drive there. I'll show you the Martand Temple, Kheer Bhavani... Tulamula, Habba Kadal, Rainawari, Shankaracharya... Karan Nagar. My maternal home was at 84, Karan Nagar. Listen, I want you to fulfil my last wish. Grandpa. Please Grandpa. I want you to scatter my ashes in my ancestral home in Kashmir. I had 4 friends. You will find their numbers in my phone. Take them along with you. The window of my room rots from all the heavy snowing. You should get it repaired. My scooter, Get that painted. Its engine is new but get it painted. Only 8,000 kilometers old. And... oh yes, your school certificates. Don't doubt. Don't doubt. All will be fine. Oh snow, fall please. Oh brother, come to greet us Impossible... impossible takes time... But you must... you must always keep hope. The nightingale sings praises of the Indian flora. We will see. We will see. It is inevitable that we will see. We will see. That day that has been promised. We will see. What is written in the book of destiny. We will see. It is inevitable that we will see. We will see. And when the mountains of oppression and cruelty. Will blow away like carded wool. Beneath our enslaved feet The ground will echo like a thumping heartbeat. Wonderful. And the sky over the heads of our rulers, Will echo with the sound of thunder. We will see. Come join us Krishna. We will see. It is inevitable that we will see. We will see. What's wrong? Krishna, any problem? My grandfather passed away last night. I have to go to Kashmir with his ashes. - So sorry. - So sorry, Krishna. Sorry for your loss, Krishna. I'm very sorry, Krishna. I never got a chance to meet him. But I am sure he was a good man. He had dementia, ma'am. All his life he kept fighting for the removal of Article 370. And he didn't even realise when it was abrogated. What about your speech? But his grandfather just died. Professor, I don't mean to sound rude but all the preparations have been made for his speech. And all the media has been informed. What about that? I'll be back by Saturday. Come. Krishna, we are fighting this election based on the Kashmir issue. So, it is a tough competition. But we will not lose. We have spent all our lives keeping the Kashmir issue alive. We cannot lose now. In fact, this is the time to demonstrate something. Like what? Go to Kashmir and record on your phone... How Kashmir is under attack by the state of India. For 18 months there has been no internet in Kashmir. Record all this... everything. Ma'am, people already know everything. No, Krishna. People only look at the newspaper, they don't read it. And they only hear the television news, they don't understand it. When people will see Kashmir's tragedy through your eyes, they will believe it. Ma'am, this is just a small college election. No, Krishna! This is an election of our existence and our narrative! And we'll never allow Kashmir to be an integral part of this country. Even if we have to set a fire for it! This is the time for justice, Krishna! Hang on, ma'am. Hang on. Hang on, please. Actually, I am quite confused. I don't know what is right and what is wrong. I don't know whether I should fulfil my grandfather's dream... Or fight for Kashmir along with you. I don't know who is the persecutor and who is the victim. I don't know what justice is, ma'am. - I don't know anything. - I... I am sorry. I am sorry, just sit. Look, every system has a hierarchy. Like in the college we have Vice-chancellor, Dean... Professors, Assistant Professors, Clerical Staff... Similarly, there is a hierarchy in oppression as well. Everyone in this world has faced some kind of oppression. Some have a voice and have followers. The ones who don't have a voice have support. Those who don't have support, have money. Some have the Government supporting them. Like the current government is supporting the Pandits. But there are some who don't have any of these things. They are just a number. Like the Kashmiri Youth. Hear their voice. Be their voice. This isn't just justice, Krishna. This is real humanism. In fact, I'll share a contact with you. It is difficult to reach him, but you can. Meet him once and you'll have the support of the entire ecosystem. Ma'am, I had no idea that you had such deep contacts in Kashmir. They might run the Government, Krishna. But we run system. Wait, let me open it. Look at that! Hail Lord Shiva! Hail Lord Shiva! I am sorry for everything, my friend. We have failed you. What do I say? Hey Kashmiri Pandit, look, you have finally come back home. I told you, you will make it back home one day. Come. You want to know about Kashmir, make a video. Do you know which animal all scavengers love to feast on together? This place... Our Kashmir. Everyone wants a piece of it. What's the difference between me and you? There isn't any. There is. There is a vast difference. Of an atom Bomb. You have one. Your media. Your media has managed to brainwash everyone that we are terrorists. We are rapists. Do I look like a terrorist to you? Do I look like a rapist to you? Look into his innocent eyes. Does he look like a terrorist to you? You have internet, we don't. You have 4G network, we don't. What is our fault? They say that we have killed Pandits. Utter nonsense. A lie. Our neighbour was a Pandit. His son was my friend. I have lost my friend. You know my father helped them when they were leaving. But what did he get in exchange? The army killed my father. But I hold no grudges. I have no regrets. Because I still miss my friend. Shiva. His name was Shiva Pandit. And what's your name? Abdul. Has the future President of ANU arrived? Yes, sir. Who lives here? And why am I here? How do you do, Mr. President? Professor Radhika Menon mentioned that your name is Krishna? But you look like Arjun. Say hello to Krishna. Say hello to Krishna. Hello Krishna. Go to your mother Don't worry. You are safe here. Whatever you have heard or read about me is a lie. In reality, this is a conspiracy of the RAW. Ours was a non-violent movement, just like Gandhi's. Convert, die or leave. You shouted these slogans. Kashmir will become Pakistan, without Kashmiri men, with Kashmiri women. Who had put these notices outside the homes of Kashmiri Pandits? It is a lie, brother. More than 1,000 families were killed. Who had ordered those killings? You had. And one of those families was mine. Allah! You have heard their side of the story. Now it's time you hear our side of the story. No one made the Pandits leave. They left on their own. Under the guidance of the Governor and your host Brahma Dutt. Some say that they ran away out of fear. If the Kashmiri Pandits left on their own, then they want to come back on their own. Why are you stopping them? There are more than 10,000 Pandits still staying in Kashmir. 10,000 or 800? Not just Pandits, we also have Sikhs in Kashmir. We all live in love and harmony. This is what I am trying to say. I won't allow colonies of hatred to exist here. If that is the case, why don't you contest the election like the others? Because I am freedom fighter, not a tool of state like the others. Let me tell you something interesting, Krishna. When the British Empire ruled this land, they had a policy. They called Congress a Pressure Cooker. A Pressure Cooker. You know why? Because Rajguru, Ashfaqullah, Azad, Bhagat Singh Wanted to get India its independence through an armed struggle. Congress was known as Pressure Cooker. So that political activities also gets a political space. That's why Gandhi's non-violent democratic movement became successful. You know who is playing the role of a Pressure Cooker now? We are. But your Government is suppressing this non-violent democratic movement. Your Government cannot tolerate this new-age Gandhi. There is just one solution, for everything. Love. You had two Prime Ministers, Nehru and Atal Bihari. The only wanted people to love them. But what does your current Prime Minister want? He wants people to be scared of him. Forget Kashmir and look at your own country, India. All the artists, thinkers, students, political activists, Muslims, Christians, Dalits... are scared. They are petrified. They live in fear. And your master is happy that people are scared of him. You are also facing a case of sedition, aren't you? Do you deserve such a big punishment for speaking the truth, Krishna? Are you truly an enemy of the state? Think Krishna. Think. If you will think about it, you will know, whether I am terrorist, or a freedom fighter. You and I are the same, Krishna. We have the same aim. Freedom. Freedom from oppression. Here, have some Kahwa. Krishna, I am pleased that despite being a Pandit you have decided to support Allah. Thank you. Krishna. By the way, I know who killed your mother and your brother. People must have said that I killed them. But that is a lie. He was my teacher. I was his student. Sharda was like a sister to me. This is what their policy is. Their war policy. Do all the damage. Do all the murders and rapes and blame us for it. So that they can continue with their illegal reign over Kashmir. Who's 'They'? The ones who killed your mother and your brother. Army. Indian Army. Let's go! Krishna. Who did you go to meet? Some friends. Whose friends? Friends of the enemies of India, or the friends of those who murdered your parents? I know the truth. Like? Like who killed my parents and my brother. I know why my grandfather always hid the truth from me And why all of you lied to me. Lied to you? Yes. You all have spun a web of lies in order to avoid the plebiscite. In order to illegally rule Kashmir. You and your system have not only illegally and unconstitutionally killed my parents But you have also killed Kashmir's past, present and future. You guys are murderers, sir. Murderers! Is this what they told you? Yes. And you believed it? You know why? Because you have been brainwashed. You are misguided. You are a coward. A coward. And cowards cannot distinguish between the truth and the lies. - Please don't decide for me. - Stop! Have you ever seen a bullet pierce through a chest? One doesn't scream like they show it in the movies. He stops breathing. Have you seen anyone getting burned? What oozes out from their body is not blood but pus, white pus. There is spine-chilling silence everywhere. And then piercing through that silence you hear slogans: Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! The ones shouting these slogans and celebrating are your executioners. Have you witnessed such a horrific experience? You haven't. We have seen it. That's why you cannot differentiate between the truth and the lies. That's why you don't feel disgusted while raising the 'Freedom' slogan. That's why Kashmiri Pandits have still not got the justice they deserve. All because of traitors like you. You want to know the truth? Do you have the courage? Look at this! Look at this! Look at this! This contains the truth of your mother, your father and your brother. That you and your friends hid from the world! What is justice? This entire game is one of hope. That's why they want you to be hopeless. They achieve that by misleading you, killing you. As long as even one Kashmiri Pandit's heart beats for India, As long as it yearns to go back to Kashmir, They cannot win. And that's why you need to win this game of hope. And that victory will be True Justice. We will see. We will see. It is inevitable that we will see. We will see. That day that has been promised. That is written in the book of destiny. We will see. It is inevitable that we will see. We will see. And only Allah's name will remain. And only Allah's name will remain. Who is both elusive and present. Who is the spectacle and the beholder, 'I am the truth' will be the acclamation. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! 'I am the truth' will be the acclamation. Which I am and so are you. And then God's own people will rule. Which I am and so are you. We will see. We will see. We will see. We will see. My young friends of India, There is no internet in Kashmir! Shame! Children are being put in jails! Shame! Kashmir is under attack! Shame! Now we will see. The way minorities are being persecuted there. The constitution is being murdered. And here is a Government that's saying, "Everything is fine". But we won't tolerate this lie anymore. We won't! Now we shall see. And we shall see it tonight itself. But the true story of Kashmir. And the promised truth. Will be shown to us by Him. So, let's give it up for our Presidential candidate... Krishna Pandit! Vote for Krishna! Vote for Krishna! Vote for Krishna! Vote for Krishna! My God, what an applause! Krishna, the world is waiting witness the truth about Kashmir. And now the stage is all yours. Tell us what you saw in Kashmir. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! I saw an open sky. Under the sky, There is a paradise surrounded by the beautiful Himalayan ranges. And in that paradise a sage visits and meditates in the mountains for years. Meditates meaning research. He researches so that he can Spread this knowledge across the world. That Sage was none other than Rishi Kashyapa. And it was him after whom this paradise was named... Kashmir. Good opening. Very inclusive. Then I saw Shankaracharya walk there all the way from Kerala. Kerala to Kashmir. He didn't own a Pushpak Viman, a flying chariot, so he literally walked. He too researched in the Himalayas for years Because the philosophy he was doing his research on was only possible in a paradise. Kashmir. Just like our best researchers, scientists, students go abroad for higher education The best of the minds across India went to Kashmir And became Pandits of their fields. Pandits like PhD holders. I saw that Abhinav Gupta and Utpaladeva were researching on philosophy. Laugakshi was researching on Astronomy. He was the first astronomer in the world. Charaka and Vagbhata were researching on Ayurveda. Sushruta - Medical science, Panini - Grammar, Vateshwara - Trigonometry, Suyya - Hydraulic Engineering, Jayanta Bhatta - Law, Kalidasa and Rudrata - Sanskrit Literature, Bhama - Aesthetics, Sharngadeva - Musicology, Vasugupta and Somananda - Advaita, Kalhana - History, Vishnu Sharma - Moral Science, Yes, he wrote the Panchatantra. I witnessed King Lalitaditya's bravery and courage. I heard Lalleshwari's poems. The movies, TV, theatre, web series, Basically everything we watch on Netflix, drama. The science behind this drama, Natyashastra, also known as the Fifth Veda, Was penned by Bharat Muni in Kashmir. I saw these millions of scholars turning Kashmir into a true paradise. Kashmir became the seal of quality. That's why the Greeks said, Kashmir is the cradle of civilization. Kashmir was the Silicon Valley of the first millennium. It's just mythology! It's all a lie! Bingo! Don't worry, I think this is all a build-up. It is a lie. That's what I think as well. Because we were never taught about it in a school or a college. It was never a part of our mainstream history books. It's a lie, right? That's why it wasn't taught to us. If this is a lie then why did the Buddhists come to Kashmir? Why did Nagasena and Ravigupta go there? They went there because Kashmir was the Centre of Knowledge. This Info War, war of knowledge isn't something new. It has been going on for centuries. If it had been a lie, Islamic Tyrants would have never invaded Kashmir in the 1300s. They invaded Kashmir because they knew that Kashmir was the world's centre for knowledge. And the one who can control the knowledge can rule the world. But there was a problem. You can seize the land, But how do you seize the free minds of the evolved Pandits, I mean Scholars. That resulted in a new game plan. The tyrants sent armed soldiers to convert these Pandits. They forced them to convert. And the ones who wouldn't agree to convert were butchered. These are the same people who were persecuted. And Kashmiris gave them refuge. Hey! What kind of rubbish is this? This isn't rubbish! This is the exact description in Shamsu'd-Din Muhammad Araqi's biography Tohfatu'l Ahbab. Do you know who Araqi was? Huh? No? You are studying in India's topmost university but you don't know who Araqi is? How would you know about him? No one taught you anything about him. We all know about Hitler. Araqi was an Islamic Tyrant who was A lot more dreadful than Hitler. His sole intention was to destroy the temples and shrines of infidels. To put an end to their traditions and rituals. To destroy innovations made by the Pandits. Someone just told me, "Come on dude, Nazis killed 1000 Jews every day." "I have never heard any such thing happening in Kashmir." Well, hear this. Under Araqi and his PM Musa Raina's order 1,500-2,000 infidels were captured every day. They would cut their sacred Hindu thread, They were made to read the Kalma, the declaration of faith, They were circumcised and forced to eat beef. All this was done by their soldiers. The ones we know as Sufis and Dervishes. Hitler used concentration camps and Araqi used Qahran and Zabran. It means Force and Compulsion. You know who described this? Araqi's own son. And if you want the original manuscript, it is available in Research and Publications Department of Jammu and Kashmir State, Under Accession Number 551. Must read. This is all a lie! Kashmir's truth is so true that we always think that it's a lie. In this "Independent" India... In this "Democratic" India... In this "Secular" India, They were once again ousted with swords and guns. Convert! Die! Leave! Convert! Die! Leave! Do you know what this means? Raliv means Convert! Chaliv means leave! Galiv means Die! Convert! Leave! Or die! This was their seventh exodus. And this wasn't an ordinary exodus. This time it was a genocide. And the story doesn't end here. They faced yet another genocide. And neither Araqi nor the Terrorists nor the State were responsible for it. But you and I were responsible for it. You! You! You!. All of you! When we decided to remove them from our hearts and our minds. And this was the real genocide! This is a lie! There was no real genocide. We don't want your fake propaganda! Listen Krishna, don't preach, tell us what you saw. If we haven't read about it, it's not a part of our history. If we haven't seen it, it hasn't happened. So, there was no real genocide in Kashmir. If anyone tries to tell the truth, you say, "Don't Preach!" Yes. Now he will prove his own hypothesis wrong. I don't bet on ordinary horses. The knowledge because of which Kashmir was known as the Cradle of Civilisation was never treated as a National Heritage by us. Now this Knowledge Centre of India is on the verge of extinction. And we aren't even aware of it. Say "Shame! Shame! Shame!" Why did we divide the dead? Why were the ones who died known as Kashmiris and not Indians? They didn't just kill Kashmiri Pandits in the year 1990. They killed all moderate Muslims as well. And not just them, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Dogra, Gujjar, Dalit Whoever raised a voice against terrorism was killed. They even killed the soul of Kashmir. Theatre. Art. Music. Literature... Everything was banned. In 1996, one cinema hall dared to open its shutters, and they opened fired in it. People died. So many Temples were destroyed, set on fire. Were they just Temples? Were they just Shrines? Weren't they pieces of India's finest architecture? Weren't they a symbol of Indian history? Weren't they India's Spiritual Centers? Isn't destroying Indian Architecture, Indian Heritage Centers, Indian Spiritual Centers a cultural genocide? Stop this rhetoric, talk facts or shut up. Shut up! Let him talk. - I want to listen. - Me too! Speak up, Krishna! Speak up, Krishna! Speak up! In a television interview, Bitta had openly accepted That he had killed 20 innocent people. Yet someone who has killed Air Force Officers in broad daylight Gets invited to India's topmost office. Won't you call that an Administrative Genocide? Where will you go after this function is over? Your home? No one can dare stop us from going back to our own homes. But will Kashmiri Pandits ever get an opportunity to go back to their homes in Kashmir? Is this Justice? I am just a student. The so-called Youth of India. The Future. I don't know much about the world. But I certainly know that a nation where they there is no Right to Justice. Can never be the Universal Guru. Radhika. Professor Radhika Menon. You once told me that every story has a villain. Yes, it is true. And there is no villain worse than the one Who takes a mother away from her child. The country where you are born is known as your motherland. So yes, Kashmir is my mother. My mother's name was Sharda. This is her story. My brother's name was Shiva. This is his story. But this is not just the story of my mother. It is the story of your mother as well. Now let's watch something I have never seen before. Then you can decide who the culprit is. Who should be punished? And in the end, Place a hand on your heart and decide, How do you plan to repent for this, And what is your definition of humanism? What is that An-Al-Haq? What is that Lauh-e-azal? "This day that was promised to us!" "We will see," Now we will all see. Indian Army. Sir. We have received news that there is going to be a terrorist attack on the Pandits. We need the names and address of all the Pandits in this area. Now listen carefully. - You will all leave this village. - Yes, Sir. Now this station is under our command. Take all the weapons. Indian Army! All the Pandits, please step outside. We are the Indian Army. We are the Indian Army. - Father, it's the security force. - Please step out. I think Brahma uncle has sent them. - I'll go and check. - Please step outside. We are here for your protection. We are here to protect you. - Come on, hurry up. - Please, please.

Everyone, please step outside. We are here to protect you. Look after him, I'm coming. You don't need to be scared. Keep moving. Go on. We are the Indian Army. We are here to protect you. Keep moving. Please stand in a circle. All the Pandits, please stand in a circle. All the Pandits, please stand in a circle. Listen carefully. Only Kashmiri Pandits will stay here. Others will step back. Only Kashmiri Pandits will stay here. Others will step back. What are you doing? They are not the Indian Army. - They are... - Father! Father! Father! Father! Father please get up. No. Father please get up. Let's escape. Bitta. Father! What do you want? No. There should be someone to tell the world of what conspired here today. Mr. Pandit, I want you to go and tell everyone in India what you witnessed here today. Oh mother! Father! No! No Father! No! Father! Bloody Hindu! Krishna stay here. I'm coming. Alright. Stay here.
