- Nice, nice yeah. Give the cement mixer plenty of room. Fine. No, yeah. Slowly get into the right lane. No, no, no, no, no, not the shoulder Mrs. Salsky. No, don't follow the cement mixer! You're going into a construction zone! - Hey lady, look out! - Watch out for the cement! Oh, Missus, oh my God! - Hey, what are you crazy? - Yeah, the same to you fella. - My goodness, I can't see a thing. - Just pull the same nob towards you to engage the spritzer. - Oh, okay. - Very good. You have finally located the left hand turn signal. - Oh boy! You mean I have to listen to that racket every time I make a turn? - You'll get used to it Mrs. Salsky. Yeah, that's the spritzer. - Lady, lady! Lady? - Oh. - Would you move your car please? - There. You feeling any better? - Oh. I don't know, I think so. - Hey, we don't have all day! - Good, good, I'm glad. - Oh my God! - Hey, Joey shut down the mixer, huh? - Would you like to take the car out of reverse and turn the motor back on now? - Okay. - What's goin' on over there? Hey, come on I got work to do. Please move your car! Thank you. - Okay, you're coming out to a toll booth. Reduce your speed gradually. Very good. - Thank you. - Oh, watch out for the uh, truck creeping over. Nice. You're doing very well Mrs. Salsky. What on earth are you doing? - I cannot go in there, I cannot go in that tunnel! - Hey, move it lady! - Mrs. Salsky, you cannot turn off the engine every time you have a problem. - I'm sorry darling but it's too narrow. It's too dark in there. I'll hit somebody without question. - It only looks that way from here. Both the lanes are exactly the same size and the tunnel is very well lit. - Why didn't we take the bridge again? - Because you stopped there too. - Get a load of this. Looks like they've been to Jersey. - So me and my buddy, you know, we're drag racin' over the Long Island Expressway, right? So, obviously we come upon this truck, right? And this stupid jerk, he starts squeezin' me you know into the shoulder. So now I got my buddies comin' up on my butt. I gotta do somethin' quick, right? So I just, I just cut over into his lane and just pull him off into the center divider. I mean this kid's a real jerk. He's got a 10 ton, you know? - Mr. Merino, could you tell us approximately how fast you were going? - Well, the police said I was goin' 105 but I know that I was doin' better than that when I hit the barrier. - You hit a barrier at that speed? - You think I could go get a smoke? - It sounds like you already did. Moving along to someone a little more tame we hope. Walter Depasqualy? Walter, would you please state your offense. - He's, he's the buddy. - Dude. - Why don't we take a 10 minute break? - Before we start sweetheart, give me one of your award winning smiles. Go on, you can do it. For old time's sake. - You dog. - First, I wanna apologize to you for not earning enough money in my lifetime. I , I wish I could have provided for you in a better way. You deserved more, a whole lot more. - Like what? What, a mink coat, a bigger diamond ring? Didn't you know that I was satisfied with my down jacket and VCR? - I'm doing my will this crazy video way for two reasons. First, as you know I'm a big ham. I shoulda been oh, I don't know an actor instead of a salesman. Secondly, I wanted to get a few things off my chest that got shoved under the carpet over the years. I know, I know our marriage wasn't the best as marriages go. I mean, I'm not the most , romantic guy in the world, I admit it. But didn't we have some good times over the years? That brings me to an important point. Don't stop having those good times. I love you sweetheart. I'll love you through eternity. - Ah, 10:30. - Wait, wait, stop. What are you doing? What are you... Will you please tell me what you are doing? - You promised me that you would slowly get rid of Martin's things - Don't. - and it's been almost a year. - Listen, don't start with me and you get out of here with these boxes. - I will not let you live this way. - Look, I will live any way I please and it you don't like it you'll find another friend to visit. - You really are a hypocrite, you know that? You're showing more affection - Oh. - for Martin now than you ever did the entire time you were married to him. - I loved him. - You tolerated him. - Don't tell me how I felt! - Then stop making Martin into a saint. You're, you're living here like it's a shrine with his pictures everywhere and his bathrobe still hanging on a hook in the bathroom. - God forbid Leo should die. What would you do? Open the window and toss his things out on the street? - No, no. I would have just as tough a time as you're having but I know you wouldn't let me down. You would just the same thing when it came time for me to let go. Oh, Ruth help me. - Oh my God. Look at Martin in bell bottoms. Oh! Where's one of yours? - No. - I wanna see one of you. - There are no photographs of me from the 60's in this house. - Oh, come on. - Basement box. Ah, the cocktail napkin from the Brookhaven Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. - Oh. - What a fiasco that was. Our tenth anniversary. The bed was too soft and Martin's back went out among other things. Uh, toss it. - Okay. - Poker chips, no thank you. - Goodwill. - Oh, what are these? - Uh, trash. - They don't look like trash to me. - Well, they are. Come on, don't be a trouble maker. - I think you should save Martin's love letters. I have all of Leo's. Oh. These aren't from Martin. - Could I have them back please? - Sam Morrissey from high school? "Even though so much time has passed, "I still remember your eyes the night we danced "in the moonlight?" - Rude! - All right. You little devil! The postmark is August 1972. - What can I say? We kept in touch. - Order in sync Berger's Burger. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Oh. - All right, we'll let you know. - Oh! Oo, I haven't had a Berger's Burger in over a year. Oo. - One onion-- - There are no men here. - What do you mean? Joe and Larry are here. - Well, I rest my case. - Good to be back. - Ordering one Berger's Burger. G-- - You know, she seems okay. - She didn't say two words to me. - That's because you didn't go to the funeral. - That was nine months ago. Besides, I was scared. - Terry. - Well, after all Marty was the first one in our group. Not counting my divorce. - Ordering one Berger's Burger for-- - I cannot believe that you're all standing around like a bunch of polar bears. Anybody want an onion ring? - Mm hm, me. - Thank you. - Yep. - Oh, I'd hardly compare a ladies luncheon at Berger's Burgers with a 40th high school reunion. - Oh, come on Jean. You've got to go. - Three burgers, fish burger. - I'm sorry I didn't call. I've been a lousy friend. - On large, one small. - Yes you have Terry. - Two colas. - Well, you know, you never know who you might see there. - The end of the line. - Well, I have happily missed all my high school reunions. I have no intention of starting now. If there was anyone that I wanted to see, I would've looked him or her up. - Jean, please you'll have fun. There'll be a lot of singles there. - Will somebody please tell Terry that I'm listening to my current friends today. - How can you pass up seeing the post war pinup queen? - Oh! - I remember that one! - Betty, meet me in the bushes, brambles. - Oh, it's very tempting but I'll pass. - Coffee, coke. - Oh, what about Mark Grossman? - Oh, God I hope he doesn't sing "Oklahoma." - He will! He really will. - You can take pictures for me. - Even Sam Morrissey's? - Sam Morrissey. Oh, there is a man. - Not one word. - Berger's Burger, one with cheese, one with bacon. ♪ You're doin' fine Oklahoma ♪ ♪ Oklahoma ♪ ♪ O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A ♪ ♪ Oklahoma ♪ ♪ How come you can in high school ♪ ♪ And couldn't be any proud ♪ ♪ And if you don't believe ♪ - Smile. - Good, Ken. - Oh, hi there. - Good to see you. - Hi, thank you, and you? - Hi. - Is he here? - Sam? Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought you were someone else. - Jean Miller. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry I don't remember. - Marshall Warner, same here. - Oh, it doesn't matter. It's nice to know you now. Would you like to dance? - Uh, I'm not much of a dancer. - Nor I. Well, then why bother? - I'm curious. What did you look like when you were young? - Oh, I've had the same face since I was 12 years old. - And it's a damn good one too. - I really should be getting back to my table. - You are a very sexy lady. - Excuse me. - Yay! Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra. Ra, ra, ra, ra, ra. You really are disappointed aren't you? - I never should've come. I am just no good socially. - Oh, that's not true. I really did think Sam would show up tonight. - Oh, he probably thought I was coming. - Oh, don't be so hard on yourself. - Well, what a stupid fantasy anyway. Oh! - Why don't you write to him? - Are you completely out of your mind? I'm certainly not going to write to him out of the blue. I don't even know what he's doing with his life these days. I mean, he might be remarried or whatever. - Well, there's only one way to find out isn't there? - I wouldn't know what to say. - Uh, let's see. It would be um, hello. Hello Sam. It's just lovely to see you again after all these years. When have you ever been at a loss for words? Oh, well is that too formal? Okay. So, let's see. You would say um, hello Sam darling. I've been waiting for four decades to feel those rippling muscles of yours again. So, how 'bout making on for me right now? - That is, disgusting. "Dear Sam, "I made a complete fool of myself "over you this evening at our high school reunion "and you weren't even there." Don't go near the street sweetheart. - Okay Grandma. - Mom, is this geranium dead or alive? - Neither, it's plastic. - Hello. - Oh, hello there Mr. Campbell. Oh, this was a mistake. - Don't worry, I've had worse haircuts. It'll grow. - What's the matter Mom, what is it? - Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing. - Mom, no one stands there shaking over coupons. - Oh my God. - What is it? - He sent me a plane ticket! - I can't believe you encouraged her to do this. - I can't either. - What is so terrible about a weekend in East Hampton? - Everything. She doesn't even know this man. Where's she going to sleep? - My God, I didn't even think of that. - He's a doctor. I'm sure he has a guest room. - And what if he doesn't? - Will you stop acting like her mother! - He's got one hell of a lotta nerve. What if Daddy were alive? - Oh, God forbid. He'd probably drive me to the airport. - You should be glad she's finally going out. - I am not going anywhere. I am sending the ticket back. - Now, you've see what you've done? - Look, I'm just trying to protect her. - She didn't do anything. The whole idea is crazy. I mean I haven't seen or spoken to the man in 35 years. I'm certainly not gonna go risking my life on a single engine plane for somebody who could turn out to be the Boston Strangler. Well, you never know what happens. - All right, all right. I give up. If worst comes to worst we can always drive out and get you. - It's not like you're going on Imperial's! Come on. This is only in Hampton. Give me a break. - Careful of my pearls. The clasp on them is funny. - You can be sure I'll treat them as if they were real. - I don't know why you didn't take my cocktail dress. - How many outfits does she need? She's got two of mine and one of Marion's. - Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this! - This is so exciting! I always liked Sam. - What do you mean? You were the one who always told me he was selfish and boring. - Well, that doesn't mean I didn't like him. - A dream come true. I wish I were going. - Here, enjoy. He'll never know the difference. - Oh, stop it! - Look what I look like! Oh, why did I dress like this? My God, I look dolls from every country. - You look fabulous. - Well, here goes nothing. - Goodbye. Good luck. - Have a good time. - Goodbye. - Thank you. - Goodbye, bon voyage. - Goodbye. - Are you wearing anything metal? - No, I'm just very excited. - Bye, bye! - Goodbye! - Bye! - Buh bye! - Bye! - Bye! - Very good. Let up on the accelerator now. Now. You have a nice wide lane. Check the rear view mirror. You're swerving, hold it steady. Better, better. Okay, apply your brakes gently. Keep breaking. What are you doing? Why are you going that way? There, that's the right direction. Now, slowly aim into the space. Watch out for the terminal! Oh , thank God! - Hello and welcome home! Oh okay. - Kathy? - Hi! - It's pretty rough there sometimes. - They told me to come out anytime. - Oh. - Sam, it's so great to see you again. I, I'm so glad you got my card. You're looking so well. I'll be getting back on that plane now. - Jean? - You are Sam. And now I really am getting back on that plane. - Hey, hey come back here. - Um, I might as well warn you up front that you are dealing with a very crazy lady who, who has been known to utter unintelligible things to herself sometimes in public places. - Oh. I can't tell you how good it is to see you again. - Good. I won't either. Look, if you haven't already noticed this is, this is all a defense. - Aren't you gonna let me kiss you hello? - Depends where. - I was hoping where we left off. - Um, Martin only died nine and a half months ago. - I'm sorry. - Flight 60 is now ready for boarding. - Hey. You've grown a beard you know? - Yeah, I know. Diane hated it. Said it irritated her skin. - Well, she had one too? - No. I haven't seen her since the divorce. - Okay, moving right along. For the third and last time I'm getting back on that plane. - 35 years. It's unbelievable. - I know. - You still have that sparkle. - I'm such a liar. I promised everyone that I wasn't gonna cry. Monogrammed! Oh! Oh. Well, are we just gonna stand here forever doing "One Life to Live" or are you going to take me on that grand tour of everything I missed? - Come on. - It's amazing. - What is? - Your dashboard. I have never been in a car with this much wood. Is it mahogany? - Burl. - It really is nice here. You didn't come to a complete stop. - Huh? - It's called a rolling stop. - You sound like a driving instructor. - I am a driving instructor. - Come on, is this a rip? - No, I also teach traffic school twice a month. - How in the world did you ever end up doing that? - It appealed to the crusader in me. I read somewhere that automobile crashes were the major cause of death to children in this country. I needed to do something since I didn't type or go to medical school. - You're still on the bandwagon aren't ya? That's great. - I had a good teacher. - Oh, come on. I organized one scrap metal drive for the war effort. - I was impressed. As I am now. Well, you've come a long way from Cabrini Boulevard, Dr. Morrissey. - Well, to tell you the truth I think I was happier then. - Well, I know most successful people say that so I'm told. - Uh, I uh didn't wanna leave these in the car. - Oh, specially in this neighborhood. - Oh no, no I got you a room at a hotel. Mm, that reminds me I better confirm the reservation. Excuse me. - All right. A seashell for your thoughts. - A sandcastle for yours. - Why did you send me the plane ticket Sam? - Why'd you come? - I don't know really. Well, maybe it was a chance to feel young again, to reminisce for a couple of days. They were very happy times for me. Nobody knew how to have a better time than you. Do you still know how to have a good time? - Well, it's not exactly the same as when we were 18 but yeah I give it a whirl. What? What are you smiling about? - It just makes me feel good to know you're happy. - Right this way please. - Evening. - Oh, hello Sam. - Charles, you're looking well. - Sam, nice to see you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - There are no prices on the menu. - Don't worry about it. - Uh, two of whatever he orders. - Medium. - Very good, Sir. Excuse me. - I'm very impressed. What'd you order? - Salad and lamb chops. - Here you go, Sir. - I'll bet that uh, Diane spoke French. - Yeah, matter of fact she did. - Do you miss her? - I thought this was gonna be our evening? Jean, the only good thing to come out of my marriage was my son. - Relationships. - Yours or mine? - I thought this was going to be our evening? - Hey, do you still bowl? - Oh! Not in 35 years, 35 years. - Nor I. - Oh my, oh God! Oh! Uh, not to add anymore pressure but I am on a double. When was the last time you said you went bowling? - Uh huh, you'll like her. Okay. - Okay big shot I dare you to order in French. - This is living. - Oh God, how I've missed this. I don't know why but I suddenly have this mad urge. - Yes? - For sloppy Joe's. - Oh, oh, oh sloppy Joe's. - Do you remember the time your parents were away and we made sloppy Joe's and camped all night in your bedroom? - We were playing Parcheesi. My poor mother. She complained about those burnt pots til the day she died. - Well, it coulda been worse. Thank God for the creaky stairs and the fire escape outside your window. - Wait. - Hm? What's this? - I am pretending that I'm sneaking back into my parents house. - You're a character. Hey, I don't suppose you'd like to sneak back into my house? - I don't suppose. - Uh, I don't suppose you'd like to invite me in for a nightcap? - You're right, I don't suppose. Goodnight Sam. - Goodnight. - Oh! - Nice shot. - Really good. - That was great Dr. Morrissey. Great. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - You know if this weren't for charity I wouldn't have considered playing. You're a terrific sport. - Oh, don't be silly. I loved every drawn out minute of it. - Hey Sam. - Hey Chet, Chris. Chet's a good friend. We've been on staff together at the hospital over 20 years. He and Chris are a lot of fun. - Come on. - They, they look very hang loose. - They're gonna love ya. Come on. - Of course. - Chet and Chris Thompson, I'd like you to meet a very dear friend of mine, Jean Miller. - Nice to meet you. - It's my pleasure. - Jean and I go way back. - Oh, the Cambridge days? - No, the Bronx days. - You mind if I uh, borrow Sam for a moment? - Of course not. - Excuse me. - Sam. - Uh, so uh, do you play? Golf? - Oh, just miniature. - Oh. - One, two, three, four, five, six. Open. - Oh, oh my God. Oh. Oh, you certainly know how to push all the buttons don't you? - Oh, I wish I could turn the clock back on everything. You know, I couldn't remember. Your father's truck was red wasn't it? - Fire engine red. Oh. - There you go. - It's not another French restaurant I hope? - No, it's not another French restaurant. - Oh, the diner? - Nope. It's not the diner. - Oh, too bad. I like the diner. This tops the diner. - There we go. To friendship. - To friendship. Mm, mm, mm. - Hm? - That's all for now, you're driving. Gee, it's funny. If you squint and subtract a few decades, we could be on the Palisades over looking Manhattan. - Jean, there's something I wanna tell you. Since my divorce I, I haven't lived my life in a vacuum. I've been seeing somebody for quite some time, and recently we broke up but , then last night she called me. - You love her? - Yes, I do. - Oh. Thank God, now we can relax. - Can we? You know, when I heard from you out of the blue I... It did something to me. I didn't know it was going to happen but I, I felt I had to see you. I wasn't expecting this. - Expecting what? - I still had feelings for you. I should've married you in the first place. - Oh, God. - Berger's Burger. One with cheese, one with bacon. One onion rings, one fries. - You could at least tell us if you had a good time. - I had a good time. - Does he still have all of his hair and a friend for me? - He still has most of his fair. - This is like pulling teeth. - Well, I would act the same way Marion. I mean, why discuss it until you know what's what? She's probably thinking why jinx it? - Has he called? - No. - You've been home all morning and you haven't heard from him yet? - He has a girlfriend. Now will the ladies of the FBI please drop the investigation? - What did I tell you? I never trusted him. He was rotten then, he's rotten now. He's a weasel. - He is not. - How did you find out? - He told me. - So he's not such a weasel. - I can't believe that he's dragged her all the way to the Hampton's for this. - Well, at least he paid for it Marion. - Not emotionally. If I were Jean, I'd be going absolutely crazy out of my mind. - It's her own fault. - Did I leave? - I feel terrible. - All I can say is I hope to God you gave that bastard a piece of your mind. - I did nothing of the kind. He was a perfect gentlemen. We ate lamb chops, we went bowling, we went to the beach. He kissed me goodbye and then I cried. - That's telling him. - To me the depressing thing is the girlfriend. Can you imagine what a loser she must be being stuck with him? - I brought you some vitamin C. - Thank you. - See, I'm no good with you and I'm no good without you. - What's to become of us? - I don't know. - What's this? - Shut up and open the present. Mm. - Oh, just what I needed. A new stethoscope. - Cough. - It's a bolo tie and they're the rage. - Thank you for keeping me so hip. - I swear, this is the last time I buy you anything. - Yeah, tell that to my closet. - Well, who else do I have to spend my hard earned money on? - I don't have a child. - So, where were you this time? - I was having fun. - Want to elaborate? - Do you care? - Yes, I care. - I was with my parents. - Really? - Yes, really. So, what silly things have you been up to lately? - Hm. The usual. - Can we drop this? - Look, the day we put you on that airplane, you acted just like a young school girl going off on her first date and now you're back to being an old lady again. I think you should call him. - I can't. - This is the 80's. Women are allowed to pick up the telephone. - And say what? - Whatever you're feeling. - I don't know what I'm feeling. - Well, I know what you're feeling. You're feeling hurt, neglected, rejected, manipulated, used. - Would you settle for plain disappointed? - Well, if it happened to me I'd be pretty furious. - At my age this is as furious as it gets without having a heart attack. Look, I the long run it's better this way. I mean, we were both curious. We got together, had a few laughs and that's that. I wanna kill him. - I'd give anything for the good old days. Number one novelist was a submarine and not a way of life. God, I hate this stuff. - That's what you get for robbing the cradle. - This is brutal. You know, every time Claire puts an ounce of fat on her body, I've got to pay for it with the weights and the jogging and the slimming and the biking and the... Oh God. I tell ya, not to mention the trendy diets. Once she gets started-- - Oh, come on now stop complaining. At least she got you to lose that spare tire. I'm never gonna get rid of mine. - Spare tire? You look like people are age are supposed to look. I don't know. I don't know what's happening with our generation. We're all like we're in training for the Olympics or something. You know, you know last weekend when, when Jean was here, you know what I had to eat? Sloppy Joe's, greasy French fries, an old fashioned root beer, and a giant banana split with those, those cherries on it that everybody tells you are poison. You know something? It was fantastic. I haven't enjoyed myself being so unhealthy in years. - Does Claire know about this attempted suicide? - No. I'm so confused lately I feel like I'm gonna explode. - Over banana splits and sloppy Joe's? - Over everything. - Don't make any plans for Friday night darling. Joe and Marcy want us to come over and see the baby. I can't believe she's pregnant again. - You have any salt? - Salt? - Yeah, some salt and a little bit while you're at it. - Darling, you know those things aren't good for you. - Yeah, I know. I'm a doctor, I know all about salt and butter. - Hm, is this your way of getting even? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You've been trying to pick a fight with me ever since we got back together. What is that? - Hm? - That? - That is a plain Cuban cigar from my favorite store that you haven't let me visit since we've been together. - Not in my house. - I'll smoke it on the balcony. - No. - No? - No. - Really? - Yes, really. - Fine! - Oh! - Darling, I, I'm sorry. We, we have to talk. I don't, Claire? Claire, is that you? - Just for the record, that wonderful weekend I spent with you made me sick! How dare you toy with a person's emotion for your own neurotic pleasure. You are a hazard to the entire female population and you always have been. - Oh yeah? Listen to me-- Hey? Oh! - Listen what kinda sick person are you anyway? - To be involved you, terminally ill. - Uh... Listen to me. You are messing up my life and you have no business hanging up on me. Look, Claire I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Can I come over and can we talk things out? - Sure, whatever. - I really don't feel like talking to you at 3:30 in the morning. - Claire, I'm sorry I was so abrupt with you. I apologize for my bad behavior. - It's not really about salt, butter and cigars is it? - No, it's more than that. When we took the last of our forced vacations from each other I, I spent a weekend with somebody else. - Great. Don't tell me, you fell instantly in love? - Not exactly. - Who is she? - She's someone I used to go out with when we were both very young. - Did you sleep with her? - No. - I mean ever. - Yes, 35 years ago. - So, are you gonna see her again? Are you gonna try to rekindle - Look, before we-- - this great high school-- - Wait, wait, wait a minute. Will you just let me talk? - Yes, yes. - Claire, in those two days I learned more about myself than I have in years. - Like what? - Like, I don't enjoy pretending I'm 39 years old when I'm not. I don't like MTV, I don't like after hours clubs. I don't like hip cuisine. - You mean, you'd rather feel old? - I'd rather be comfortable. - And she makes you feel comfortable, hm? - Come on now, you're not, you're not playing fair. - And I'm not going to. - I thought every one of my cars was a lemon until that nice judge told me why don't I consider taking driving lessons. - Why don't you fill out this application. - Good morning Marie. Oh, isn't it wonderful to be alive? - I wouldn't know. What's wrong with you? - Today is the first day of the rest of my life. - Could you celebrate later? Your 11 o'clock's been waiting for 15 minutes. - I don't care. - Wait a second. - I bet I'll fail again. - What are you doing here? - Somebody told me I should brush up my driving skills. - Don't they have driving instructors in East Hampton? - Not like you. - You want a lesson, I will give you a lesson. Get in. - After you. - You first. Seatbelt. - What's going on? - You haven't changed one bit. Adjust your seat position. - What does that mean? - Your seat position! There's a lever underneath. You would do anything to dump being the responsible person that you are not. - Oh really? You know something? I happen to be a hell of a responsible person. - Oh! - I came down here to clear the air. - LA will be declared the clean air capitol long before you have made a dent in this paper. I'm not gonna let you do this to me again. I'm not going to let you! - Do what? Huh? Do what? Listen, ah! - You know, nobody twisted your arm to send me that plane ticket. Nobody twisted your arm to wine, dine and deceive me. - Deceive you? You wrote to me! - Oh. Always that phony Mr. Nice Guy. Always that disgusting charm. You could fail and exam and pass on your smile. You could snap your fingers and have the entire nursing staff fall at your feet but not me. - Oh no, you are much classier. You just ran off with the first available pair of pants in sight! - After you dumped me. - I never dumped you! - And what about Joyce Abrams, huh? - Studying for exams. - For two months? - Oh, come on. I don't believe this. There was never anybody else but you. That's all in your screwed up little head. - Garbage. You never even looked at me once you got into medical school. I was great for the senior prom but not the precious Met Ball. - You had the whooping cough. - With you it is always excuses. One after another. - You know something? I really have a good mind to leave. - Great, leave. - Fine, I will. - Coward! - They're 14 karat gold. - I don't give a damn what you said. - 14 karat gold! - Is that why I got shifted from Fridays and Saturdays to the Sunday night deli slot? People don't even do that to their grandmothers. - I was in medical school. - You were looking for something better, admit it. You could never keep your eyes in their own socket. - You believe this crap? - He's right, it is crap. I wasn't good looking enough, I wasn't smart enough. I wasn't rich enough. I was tall enough, that's about it. - Oh, I must be out of my mind to even consider even for a moment breaking up a relationship for this insanity. - Maybe you should have gone the full nine yards with Helen Stoover. She had her nose fixed. It is amazing the lengths that some women will go to to please their Sam. - I am not talking about then. I'm talking about now. Here, here and now! You, oh, I can't take anymore of this. Taxi! Taxi! - Oh, no you don't! No you don't! - LaGuardia Airport. Oh, you've changed. You have changed. And as unhappy as I am at this moment I'm glad about one thing. - Oh you, what is that one thing? - I'm glad we took the time out for this refreshing little chat because now at least we know where we stand. - Oh really, and where is that? - The one thing-- - You already did for one thing. - For one thing those torches we were carrying for each other all these years were probably birthday candles. - Oh yeah, at most matches. - In fact, we probably never loved each other. Jean? Aw, Jean. Jean? Jean? Hey. Jean I... - Thank you. - Jean? Come on. - What are you crazy? - Jean, I didn't mean that. - Over here! - I should have married you in the first place. I suppose you did mean that. - Oh, how the hell did we ever get so angry with each other in the first place? - I don't know. I suppose it was there all along. - Really? What were we doing about it? - Knowing us, ignoring it. - Well, technically I mean if you look at it objectively I suppose we should both be relieved huh? Right? - Technically. - Okay, see ya. - You're relieved? Neither am I. - Oh, thank God. - Look, I don't know how you feel about this but, I could get a later plane. You know, if you wanted to spend more time together exploring why we don't feel relieved. - Now I'm relieved. - Yeah? - And hungry. - Come on. - Ladies, ladies, hold on. - Onion rings and fries on it. - Now once more from the top. How many salad bars? - I'll have a small salad bar. - Okay. - And a chocolate shake. - Okay. That's one small salad bar and one chocolate shake-- - Sam, I'm awfully sorry. I didn't know they'd be here. - That's okay. Have you decided yet? - About what? - Lunch. - I've decided. I'm gonna have a salad bar. - Uh huh. - And if it's not too much trouble a cup of lemon wedges. - Okay. All right, that's uh, two salad bars and one cup of lemon wedges. - And a chocolate shake. - Yeah, the chocolate shake. - Oh, should I have the salad bar too? - Uh-- - The suspense is killing me. It's like the "Academy Awards." - Fine, I'll have the salad bar. - Okay. That's three salad bars and-- - Oh no, I better stick with a Berger Burger. - All right. That's two salad bars, one chocolate shake, - He's so cute! - And those teeth! - and a cup of lemon wedges. - They're perfectly bionic. Have you done it yet? - No Terry, have you? - You're so lucky. Harold is such a dud! - Sammy, I have this mole on my left leg. I was wondering, do you think you might be able to take a look at it? - Well uh, dermatology is really not my field but I, I can certainly put you on to someone. - Uh, Sam? - Yeah? - You forgot me. - Oh, no I didn't. Saving the best til last. - I've already ordered. - Oh boy. All right, let's see where we are here now. That's uh-- - Now, now Sam stop it. Stop it, you're embarrassing me. I'm gonna get a cab. Listen Sam, I mean it. - Oh, come on. You're no fun. - I mean you always get so wild. - That's funny. I remember how you used to love my wildness. You remember this, huh? Do you remember this? I remember this. - I remember I used to love chocolate milk on my oatmeal. - Oo, yuck! Yuck! Oh. What else did you love about me? - Oh, Sam please! - Come on, come on. My ego needs it. I've experienced rejection lately. - Oh. - Let's see, what did I love about you? Hm. - Hm. Oh, not that. Oh, definitely not that. - Definitely not what? - No, not that. - What, come on it can't be that bad. - You slouch. - I slouch? - Yeah, that's right. I mean you never once stood with your shoulders back. You still don't. - You love me because of my poor posture? - What can I say? I found it sexy. - Yeah? Your smile. You had the biggest smile I have ever seen. - That is a terrible thing to say. You make me sound like "Mister Ed." - No, no. You had a beautiful smile. Smile for me now. - Never. - Come on. - Never ever ever will - Come on. - I smile for you I swear. - Okay. Would you make a very sad face for me then like this? Ah, ah! What? You're doing it. What? Look at, what is this? The beginning of a you know what. - No, it was barely a grin. I didn't show teeth. Not exactly the Hamptons. - No, it's charming. Just charming. Oh my God! Is that your mother's sofa? - How did you remember? - How could I forget? Oh. This is the only piece of furniture we were never allowed to sit on? - She was smart. She was saving her sofa from being worn out and her daughter from being worn in. You'd like Barbara. She's my pride and joy. - Hm. Lovely. - Martin. - Mm hm. - Can I get you something? - Nope. For old times sake. - Oh! - Come on. Ah! You know, there are only two times in my life when I ever got stinking drunk. The day you married Martin. - Oh. - And the day I married Diane. Was he good to you? - Yes, Martin was good to me. - Was it exciting? - My heart pounded a few times. - Like mine is right now? - Well, you said you were in love with somebody. What happened to her? - She wants to get married, she wants to have children and she wants to move into my house. - Mm. - And what do you want? - I can tell you what I don't want. I don't want another divorce. And I don't want another child torn between two households. - You still haven't answered my question. - I wanna spend more time with you. Right now I wanna kiss you again. - Oh, honey uh, this is uh, this is Sam. Sam Morrissey. Uh, Sam this is my daughter Barbara. - Hi. - Oh, honey I'm so sorry. I completely forgot that you were spending the night. How was the conference? - Great. - I'll just be a minute. - You uh, want me to leave? - Oh no, please. I'll thank you not be rude. - What's he doing here? - None of your business. He is my guest and I expect a little courtesy and if you aren't capable of that you can leave the same way you came in. - Well, I'd better be going. Oh boy, I missed the last plane. - Oh no. - Well, that's all right. I'll go to a hotel. - No, uh... I feel terrible. Um, here why don't you sleep on the sofa? - No, no, no, no, no. That's all right. I'll go to the Regency. They always have a room there for me. Well, it was great seeing you again. - Let's not make it so long between visits next time. - Well, so long. Well, see ya. Nice meeting you. - Looks like I got here just in time. - Who is it? - Room service. - I didn't order any room service. Who is it? I, all right. Wait, wait a minute. I didn't, oh Claire! - Good morning darling. Mwah! - What, what are you doing in New York? - Just bring it in here all right? Let's make sure we have everything. Pancakes with maple syrup and topped with butter. Pork sausages, eggs Benedict, yes. Regular coffee and a box of your favorite cigars. That seems to be it. There you go, thank you very much. - Will you please-- - What? - Good morning Madam. - Excuse me, could you tell me where house phone's at? - Turn to your right Ma'am. - Claire, will you... Oh Claire, wait. Don't. Come, Claire. Don't get undressed! Claire, please. Please... Will you, will you please put this back on? - Aren't you the least bit happy to see me? - Look, look, you, Claire! Now Claire, what are you... - What? - will you stop? - What? - Will you please stop! - No. - Claire! Claire. Hello? - Guess who? - Oh! - I'm the lobby. - What are you doing? - Okay, okay. Be right down. - Would you, Sam! Who was that? Your high school sweetheart? - Yes, it was. - I knew it! I never should've settled for this half baked relationship to begin with. Everybody told me I was nuts. I mean what the hell does any woman get outta seeing somebody once or twice a week, huh? - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. How are you? - Good. - It's good to see you. - Nice to see you. - I wanna meet her. - No, Claire, Claire listen don't. Don't, don't do this to yourself, don't do this to me. - She has no business meddling in our lives. - Who is it? - Me. - Coming! Now listen to me. - What are you doing? - You get dressed right now. - I am going to-- - Sam? - Coming! All right listen to me. I'm asking you as someone very dear to me to please put your clothes on. - No. - Claire, I am begging you. I am begging you to go into that bathroom and not to come out until we leave. - All right. Fine. - Oh! - Sam? - Hi. - Well hi. What took you so long? - Hi, listen why don't we uh, you know I was thinking we-- - I thought we were having breakfast in the park. That's why I bought the donuts. - Well, you know when hunger strikes. - I do not believe this. You have ordered everything I love. You know, I'm too lazy to make pancakes at home. Let's eat before they get cold. Where do you want me? - In the park. I mean, listen why don't we stick to the original plan? It might be a lot more fun. - Than this? - Oh, I can guarantee it. - Mm, don't be silly honey. There's no reason to waste good food. Mm! - I can think of one. - These sausages are delicious. - Jean, Jean listen. - You're not eating. What was that? - I don't know, it sounded like gargling. Jean, listen to me. I have a feeling you're gonna be really unhappy in a minute. - There any syrup? - Uh... Just how unhappy it's hard to say but, if you could just let me take a moment to explain to you. - Who's in there? - Oh, it's nobody you know. - You wanna tell me who's in there? - Oh, I'm sorry. Sam, darling did you pack my conditioner in your doc kit? - How are you doing so far? - Uh, I... I'm going to pretend that uh, I didn't see that. - Jean. Now Jean. Jean. Now, the explanation for this is very simple. I mean it's so simple that... Jean, Jean will you listen to me? Jean, will you please give me... I forgot my shoes. I have nothing to say to you except it's over! Jean, will you please give me a chance? - Licensed physician in this day and age sleeping with call girls. Shame on you! - Call girls? That, that was Claire. - That child is the, oh my God! - Honestly I didn't know she was coming. She just showed up a few minutes ago. - Oh my God. - Look, I know you're upset. I know this must be truly unbearable for you. - Oh my God! - Will you please leave some space in between the oh my God's and try to absorb what I'm saying? - Oh my God. - Will you please Jean, try to absorb what I am saying. - Absorb this! - Oh! I don't wanna fight with you, I don't wanna see you, I don't wanna know you. - Will you listen to me? - Will you stop torturing me? I don't have the strength anymore. Don't you understand? Listen, I'm gonna shut my eyes and if you are not gone by the time I count to three I am going to start to scream. - Oh come on! - One, two, three. - Look, this is ridiculous. Will you-- - Help! - Will you-- - Help! - You can scream your poor little head off. - Let go of me! Oh, Sam! Are you all right? - Yeah, I think so. What about you? - Recovering. - Hey, you wanna come in? The water's warm. - No way, I'm freezing. - Wanna spend the rest of the summer with me in the Hamptons? - That would be hot water. - Ah. How are we ever gonna get to know each other if we're never together? Huh? I know, I know we, we both need time but you know I honestly think that a telephone is not the ideal way for us to solidify a relationship. What do you say, huh? - I don't know. You know, we might kill each other. - Oh, what the hell? We have to die anyway. Come on. I won't pressure you. Believe me, I know what it is - Oh! - to be pushed into something. - You're still young, you're still vibrant. You still have plenty of time. Don't give up this precious time you have. Don't. - I'm petrified Martin. Tell me what to do. - Berger's Burger no onion. - This I never heard of. Girls 20 run for vacations with guys. Girls 60 don't. - Some do. Do you want me to take some extra beets for you just in case? - No thanks Ruth. - Get a big ring on your finger first, then we'll talk serious. - You have a big ring on your finger. Is it serious? - You know, I really think you should go. What have you got to lose? - That's true. She lost that years ago. - Who said I was going anywhere? I'm considering it, that's all. - Well, what about the juvenile delinquent? - She's in her 30's. He's working that out. - I don't understand. Is it or isn't it finished? - We hope so for his sake. - One Berger's Burger Delight Deluxe. - "Cynthia, thank God you've come." Give me a kiss. Here. - Birds, birds Mom! - Yeah, yeah I know. Aren't they nice? - Uh huh. - How's the sleeping going? - Uh, fine. Yourself? - Oh, couldn't be better. Loud toilet isn't it? - As toilets go. - Well, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Deja vu. - Hi. - See you on your next run. - Oh God, I hope not. Oh, thanks for calling Ruth. Yeah, I really don't have anybody to talk to here. - What are friends for if not to share our miseries? So, what's going on? And don't give me the weather report. - Ruth, do you and uh, Leo still... You know? - As needed. - And it works? - As needed. - Oh. - Jean, talk to me. - Oh, it's been eight years since I did anything... If you thought I didn't have any confidence with Sam in high school you should see me now. - Stop worrying about that. Sam's crazy about you. Just let him take the lead. You'll be fine. - Is it really like riding a bicycle? - Come on, I'm better than I ever was, admit it. Admit it! - Well, you do know how to kiss. - Give me, come here! - And you do still - Admit it! - have a lot of energy. I'll say that. - Give me that. - Oh, don't tell me. Your briefcase again. Hello. - Hello. - I almost didn't recognize you with your clothes on. Sam's at the hospital. - These are for you. - What's in them? Just in case the paramedics get here in time. I'm half kidding. - No, that's all right. I deserve it for my poor behavior. I deserve whatever I get. - Uh, wait. Thank you for the candy. - You're welcome. - Claire? I have some fresh coffee. - It's funny, he never let me put anything in this. It was only for display. - Oh, I never used my good silver while my husband was alive. Now I use what I like. - You know, it's amazing. I'm gonna be 40 years old next week. Yeah, over the hill and I have nothing to show for it. - I wouldn't go quite that far. - What? - Oh Claire, come on. - What? - You're very beautiful. You're charming, you're intelligent. - And alone. - Well, I have a feeling you won't be for very long. - What magazines have you been reading? Right now at my age I stand a better chance at being struck by lightening then finding the right man. - 40 is a wonderful age. - Yeah, uh huh. Chris and Chet are throwing me a big bash to herald in the new decade. Isn't that great? Would you come? For nearly five years Sam was a very big part of my life. It would mean a lot to me to have him there. - Well I'll, I'll ask him. I... - I didn't wanna wake you. You looked so peaceful. - I must look a sight. - Did the gardener show up today? - No. Claire did however. - Oh? What for? - To plant some new seeds. She's invited us to her 40th birthday party. I think she's really hoping you'll come on your own. - What are you hoping? - That we send her a telegram from Guam. - Jean, you know, we can't, we can't just hide out. This is a small town. We're gonna bump into Claire everywhere we go. - Oh, the bumping is fine. It's the grinding that I'm worried about. - The only grinding that's gonna take place is right here in this room. Okay. All right, fine. We won't go. Finished. Uh, well I, gee I don't know. You know, I kinda hate to her on a milestone birthday. Maybe, maybe I should just put in a brief appearance. Just, you know for old times sake. - You are going into that den of iniquity alone and unarmed? Nothing doing. - Claire, first of all I'd be surprised if they even showed up. And secondly, Chet and I are not throwing this party for you to start acting up. - Acting up? - I would rather call the whole thing off. - Why should I be the only loser around here? - You were both losing. You both stayed in a relationship that was going nowhere too long. - He can't love her. Just can't. - I wish I could help you. I really wish I could tell you what to do. - Wait til you see me tonight. - Now, you promise me you'll behave? - That needs to be hung a little bit higher. - Promise me? - I'll behave. - That is not a good way to start. - I'll see what I can do. - Where would you like the ice sculpture? - You are one beautiful woman. - I know, I know. - Hey, what do you say we retire to the 18th Grain for a little private poetry reading? - Why do my instincts keep telling me that we should not be here? You know, this goes way beyond the call of duty. - Look, we'll stay a half hour maximum and we'll leave. All right? - All right. - Hi Sam, hi Jean. Hi Jean, get it? - Oh, like feminine hygiene. - Happy birthday, Claire. - Oh. - Happy birthday. - What, no kiss? - Introduce me to your parents. - Where is the bar? - I would if they were here. Just keep going you'll find it. Sam, stay with us. - I'll be back. - I need another drink too. - Sure. - You look wonderful tonight, you really do. Doesn't she look great? - Well I look all right tonight. - Not experiencing any buyers remorse? - None of the least. I was just remembering what a wonderful dancer you were. - Only with you. You know, you spoiled me. With everyone else it was like stomping grapes. - Shall we? - I'd love to. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Where's that one dance you promised me? - Claire, Jean and I are-- - Pretty please. I'm never gonna be 40 again. Come on. - Jean, under the circumstances are you uh, enjoying the party? - Loads. - You know, Chris and I wanna have you and Sam over to dinner soon. We've been very lax about getting to know you and frankly we feel pretty terrible about it. - Oh, thank you. That was a very lovely gesture. - I, I think I'm gonna be sick. - I'm gonna take her outside. - Nothing to it. I'll take her. - Huh? Oh! - Now first we're gonna shift out of reverse into drive. Watch those turn signals. - Sam, let me buy you a drink. You want a martini? - Well, I'll have an olive. - My usual. - Yes Sir, Mr. Thompson. - I hope she's gonna be all right in there? - Oh, she didn't drink that much. You know Claire, half of it's an act. - I'm thinking of Jean. God, why did I ever bring her to this? - Hey, so you gonna marry her, huh? - Hey, slow down will ya? - Then uh, you're not gonna marry her? - I didn't say that. - What did you say? - Nothing. I didn't say anything. - Oh no, no, no, you said slow down. - All right, big deal. Why can't I just enjoy whatever is happening? - Thanks. Because if you were that shallow I wouldn't have hung out with you for all these years. And because I know you too well. - Oh really? What do you know? - I know that you're a brilliant doctor who treats everybody in his private life as if they're one of his patients. - Do you mind telling me what that means? - Yeah, it means that it's okay for people to need you. But God forbid you should need them back. Sam, you're so self reliant it's nauseating. - You weren't married to Diane. - You haven't let your defenses down since. Ah, Sam, it's time to let somebody meaningful back into your life. Stop second guessing everybody including yourself. - Why did it have to be you to bring me in here? Why do you have to be so kind? - Okay, this is gonna be a little cold at first. - No. Oh! Oh! What does he have to look forward to with you, huh? Sam was a young man with me. He had young friends, he still had a future. We were gonna have a child together. My last chance. His last chance. Now that's out the window and in exchange for what? Nostalgia? You don't even know him now. You weren't there to nurse him through his midlife crisis. You weren't there to share the glory when his son graduated with honors. Where were you when we went to Tahiti and rolled around in the sand for two weeks? One day after it's too late, you're gonna wake up in bed next to him and realize that you've run out of old times to relive and old stories to retell and then where will you be, huh? Lying next to a stranger. - No. No, he is not a stranger. Not to me. - He will be when he walks out on you just like he walked out on me. Just like he walked out on Diane. - What am I to you? What role do I play in your life today? - What did she say to you? - Nothing I hadn't already thought of. - What did she say? - What happens next week when the vacation's over? - Jean, what's wrong? - I don't want to end up like that woman in the bathroom. When Martin died, I thought I was going right along with him. I didn't. I hadn't realized how much life I have left in me and damn it I'm gonna share it with somebody. - Jean? Jean? Jean, it's only been five weeks. - Wrong. Five weeks and 35 years. This isn't a game. If you can really follow through this time let's not do it at all. - Listen to me. I love you. - That's what you said to Claire. And if you really meant it you'd be with her now. - It's not that simple. - Yes, it is. It is just that simple if I'm really the girl you should've married. Goodbye Sam. - Ordering one Berger's Burger. Cheese, mustard only. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Okay? - Berger's Burger, uh-- - What is she gonna do in California? She has no one there. - She's got Rochelle. - Or new Rochelle since the facelift. - I just can't picture her living in California. - Why? When it's 18 degrees here she'll be phoning us from her cordless phone by the pool. - Wait til she's been in California for a year. She'll change. They all do especially the ones that miss New York. - Ruth, where is she? - Well, if she wanted you to know I guess you'd know. - Of course she wants him to know. - Would you just stay out of this please? - Look, you don't like me very much do you? - If I wanted you to know, you'd know. Well, since my best friend is thinking about moving 3,000 miles away, yes, I guess you might say I don't like you very much. - California? - I'm not saying. - Where else is 3,000 miles away? - She could be moving to England. - I'm sorry I'm late. I was trying to get run over in the, in, in the drive thru. - You know, you're right. It is just that simple. I said to myself, "Why can't I commit? "What am I afraid of?" And all I could come up with with just one word. Failure. I've fail... I failed with you, I failed with my marriage and I failed with my son and you know why? Because I could never admit how much I needed them and how they made it all worthwhile. And God, do I need you now. - Sam, you're too late. - Jean... - Are you out of your mind? - You know, ever since I got back I've had a lot of time to think. For a few glorious weeks I let myself be a teenager again. But Sam I have finally come to my senses. - Jean, Jean, don't you know there's nobody I want more than you? There's nobody I've ever wanted more than you. Jean, please marry me. - I can't. - It's our last chance. You're still bitter aren't you? - You were the, the first person I ever loved. You let me down. You hurt me terribly Sam and I don't want to hurt like that anymore. We're too old. - No. I'm not gonna let you put it off on that. Jean, look at me. Look at me. - I can't. - Look at him! - Oh! - Listen, I've loved you from the first moment I met you. I can't bear to let you go one more time. Jean, we're not too old. We're finally ready. Jean, I love you. Please marry me. - Are you absolutely sure? - I've never been surer of anything in my life. - You don't want a second opinion? - No, the diagnosis is perfectly clear. - Oh, what the hell. My mother always wanted me to marry a doctor. ♪ La la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la ♪ ♪ La la la la la la la la la la ♪ - Yay!
