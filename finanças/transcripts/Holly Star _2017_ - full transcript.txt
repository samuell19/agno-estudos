Sloan: Well, how do you figure? Kay: Santa's bag was full of cash and it's all about the Benjamins, right? You said it the other night, your new mantra, money matters most. Sloan: I said that?

Maureen: I'm more worried about you severing your arm, you've always been accident prone. Sloan: Low blow, Grandma.

[Laughs] Maureen: Toughen up, kiddo. Sloan: My life flashed before my eyes. I'm trying to piece together something I saw. Maureen: What was that? Sloan: Santa Claus burying a bag. Maureen: It was probably just your grandfather. Sloan: Wait, what? Maureen: He always used to dress up as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Sloan: Okay, in my memory he says 55 Holly Star. Does that mean anything to you? Maureen: That's the last thing he said before he died. 55 Holly Star. He sat up in the bed like he just remembered something, then he croaked. I gave up trying to figure it out. It was probably just some delirious ramble. He was no Orson Welles. Sloan: Why would he say-- Maureen: Andy. Sloan: Something completely random like that? It must have meant something. Maureen: Not necessarily, he always drank a lot on Christmas Eve. And when he was loaded, he talked gibberish. Now, let me get back to my dancing. Sloan: Wait, Grandma, is there anything of Grandpa's that I can look through? I just have this feeling he must have left something behind. Maureen: I've got some boxes of old photos and things in my trunk. I doubt you'll find anything useful but knock yourself out.

Sloan: Does this bar ever have a night for guys who dress up like Santa Claus? Like a Christmas party, anything like that. Hennessy: What are you guys reporters or something? Sloan: No, no, no, my, my grandpa used to come here I think and I have this picture where he's, he's at this bar and he's dressed up like Santa Claus. Wendy: Who's your grandfather? Sloan: Walter Kelly. Wendy: Walter Kelly, oh God. Yeah, I can see it in the eyes. Hennessy: Yeah, a little bit. Wendy: Good old Walt. - Santa Claus pub crawl is what you're asking about. Hennessy: Yeah, they used to do it every year and we were the last pub on the crawl. Sloan: And my grandpa came to it? Hennessy: Oh yeah. Wendy: Well, of course he did, it was the best place to be on Christmas Eve, right? Hennessy: Yeah. Wendy: Yeah. He was there that night, the final year of the Santa crawl. Kay: They don't do it anymore? Wendy: Oh no. Kay: Why not, what happened? Wendy: Get my pictures. Hennessy: There was a turf war going on back then. There was a lot of money at stake. Sloan: there were gangs in Maine? Maine gangs? Wendy: No, not, not gangs, lobster men. They were defending their territory against a fisherman named, um, Gunther. Hennessy: Dinklage. Wendy: Gunther Dinklage. Hennessy: Dinklage. Wendy: That's right. Hennessy: Yeah. Wendy: He was the cause of all the trouble. Hennessy: Yeah, there's Gunther right there, that mean greedy son of a bitch. Wendy: He had a dirty plan, right? He was going to get rid of all the competition. So, he hired an old boat mechanic, what was his name? Hennessy: Bones Bradley. Wendy: Bones Bradley. Hennessy: That's him. Wendy: That's who he hired to sabotage all the lobster boats in the harbor. Hennessy: There's Bones. You can tell from the fear in his eyes. Yeah, he agreed to the deal, all right. But later he had change of heart and he spilled the beans. Wendy: Yeah. Hennessy: But the lobster men told him go ahead with the pay off but to make sure that they did it on the night of the Santa crawl, so that all of them can be here. Wendy: Yeah, we didn't have any idea what might happen next. [Laughs] Sloan: Which was? Hennessy: Gunther coming through that door with three giant goons and a bag full of cash. As soon as he sat down with Bones to make the deal-- Wendy: All hell broke loose. Hennessy: Oh yeah. Wendy: There were Santa Clauses every which way, flying all over. Hennessy: Yeah, they trashed my bar. Wendy: Yeah. Hennessy: Jackasses. After that, no more Santa crawl. Wendy: No one knew what happened to the cash or even if there was any cash in the bag at all. The lobster men, they pretended like nothing had happened. They may have hated each other, but when the cops came in, they all banded together, never talked about it again. - That guy Gunther is in jail, they got him on tax evasion. Hennessy: You know, every now and then one of those guys drifts in here from time to time and somebody sometimes says-- [Laughs] In all that confusion, they picked up the wrong bag and ran out of here with a fortune. [Laughs] Yeah, wait, wait, come to think of it, it's your grandfather used to tell that story the most. Wendy: He did, yeah. Hennessy: Yeah, he was quite a character. Wendy: Oh, he was. He had a lot of friends, your grandfather. Hennessy: Oh yeah. Wendy: Whenever Walter Kelly was in the bar, everybody got a pint. Kay: Sorry, we never asked your names. Wendy: Oh, that's Hennessy. That's nobody. [Laughs] And I'm Wendy. Kay: Dammit, I thought your name was going to be Holly. Wendy: Holly? Hennessy: Holly? Wendy: Who's Holly? Sloan: We're not quite sure yet. Maureen: Oh crap, I never thought I'd have to hear that cockamamie story again. Sloan: Well, is there any truth to it? Maureen: Of course there isn't. Who told you all of this any way? Wendy? I can't believe she's still spinning that malarkey. We don't have lobster wars here for crying out loud, this is Winter Harbor. The people are nice here. Kay: Sounded pretty convincing. Maureen: Who's this gal? Sloan: It's Kay-Kay, Grandma. Maureen: That's Kay-Kay? Sloan: Yeah. Kay-Kay: Yes, Ma'am. Maureen: Mary Kay Kavanaugh, what are you doing in that ridiculous outfit? Kay: As a member of an elite fighting unit, Ma'am, I'm required to be in uniform. Maureen: You some kind of cop now? Kay: No, but I am authorized to make citizen's arrest if necessary. Sloan: At ease, soldier. Grandma, what more can you tell me about that night? Maureen: Nothing. Your grandfather told stories like that all the time, that's how he entertained himself. I loved him, but he was a Grade A nut job. Sloan: What about the money part? Maureen: One morning he starts rambling on about all this money he buried and the next thing you know he's digging up holes all over town trying to find it, the damn fool. Sloan: How could he forget where he buried it? Maureen: Well, he said he blacked out and he couldn't remember anything. Kay: Did he ever mention where he might have buried it, even a little hint? Maureen: What difference does it make? If he had buried a bag, it sure as hell wasn't filled with any cash. Sloan: Well, why not? Maureen: Because none of this lobster wars crap ever happened. How many times do I got to tell you? Sloan: I think it's true, Grandma, I was there. Maureen: What do you mean you were there? Sloan: I was with grandpa that night, I saw him bury the money, it's a memory of mine. Maureen: If you saw something, it's because you wanted to see it. Now you two shove off now, I'm tired, I've got to take a nap. Kay: They've got cocoa. We might be able to corroborate the waitress' story by pulling up some old police files. Sloan: We don't need police records, what we need is for me to remember where that bag is buried. Kay: I'm starving, what we need is to go eat something. Sloan: Kay-Kay, we are in the middle of a genuine mystery here, we can eat later. Let's recap what we know, go. Kay: Roger that. Your grandfather was knocking them back at the Star bar on Christmas Eve. Gets totally wasted, mistakenly ends up with a bag full of cash and buries it during a snowstorm. Sloan: Right, and he gives himself a marker to remember it later, 55 Holly Star. Kay: And the only two people who know what that means are your grandfather who is no longer with us, God bless him, and you, and you don't remember. Sloan: Except when my life flashes before my eyes. Kay: What about a slice of pizza? Oh, there's a good place on East Adams I've been hearing about. Sloan: Oh my God, that's it. Kay: Maybe a burger would be better. Sloan: I can remember everything when my life flashes before my eyes. Kay: No, just go to Sal, that place is great, the meat coma. Sloan: Kill me. Kay: Brisket, sausage. Wait, what? Sloan: Kill me. You're going to have to try to kill me. One, two, three, go. Faster, what are you doing? Kay: It didn't look like you were going to move. [Groans] Sloan: You have to go a lot faster than that, I will get out of the way, I swear. Kay: You want me to run you over? Sloan: We are going for a near death experience here. That's the only way I might get another clue about where the money is buried. Kay: I don't know, I want you to find the cash, but-- Sloan: Look, I realize that this might all just be one giant fantasy, but it is all I have right now, okay? I'm depending on you. [Groans] All right, fine. Maybe I should get someone else to do it. [Sighs] Someone who really knows the meaning of Semper Fi. You know, killer instinct. What are you doing? Kay: Boo-yah! Yes, come at me. - Hey, Kay. Kay: Mom, what? Yes, I told you, I am borrowing the car, and we'll take it in later. It's the kill car, remember? I am trying to pretend-kill Sloan. ♪♪♪ All right.

We should do that more often. Ooh, you know, I could have killed you. Sloan: Yeah, that was my brilliant yet asinine plan. Kay: Mission unaccomplished. Come here. [Groans] Why didn't it work? Sloan: Aside from it being a completely stupid idea that should have me committed? I don't know, maybe because I knew it was coming. Kay: Think it needs to be a surprise? Sloan: Well, when I bit it on the ice, I didn't know it was going to happen beforehand, did I? Kay: No. Sloan: Well, maybe that's the difference. The element of surprise, oh well. Thanks any way.
