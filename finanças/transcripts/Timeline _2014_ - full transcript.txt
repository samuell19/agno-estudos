I have a dream... That we own a garden of strawberries... Be careful. Do I need to add a little soy sauce? Okay, enough. Why do you want me to cook? Your cooking is better. So that ...when I'm gone... You can take care of yourself. Tun. Please do not talk like that. Writing a letter to you is fun. You are the driving force of my life. Matt, you need to be strong. Hopefully you can take care of the house. When I return. I want to see that you are strong. Not a face full of tears. Do not worry about me. I will never leave. Look around. Don't you feel it? I'm always by your side. Waiting until you're strong. I will never leave you alone in this cold village. Believe that. Mat... Mat. I'm going to town, what do you want? Wait a minute. Sorry, your school clothes are damaged again. It's okay. If the prayer is finished, wait for me in front. Okay. Love you forever, Tun. Good morning, Father. Go to your class now. Tan, it's raining, come in, you'll get sick. Quickly. Why are you teaching me how to cook? Mother's cooking is the best. Happy birthday. You like it, son? I do. How are you, madam? Tan's been skipping school, he doodles on the wall, he should be punished. Teacher, thank you. Tan. I do not like school. Honey. Have you eaten? I missed you today. Take care of yourself I know, I can not be there. You must feel very lonely. I hope this letter can make you feel better. So that you'll have strenght to face difficulties. You have to be tough. I'll always be here. Forever by your side. Timeline. Dad. Hopefully your son can go to a university. Where he doesn't have to leave home, and after graduating from college... he could continue his father's business. Hello, Bank. Have you spoken to your mother? No, I did not tell her. What are you waiting for? Soon, I'll talk to her. Actually, I'm worried about my mother. Think for yourself. Yesterday I went to the university again, there are many beautiful girls. Tan. Tan, what happened? Why are you enrolled in the journalism college of the University of Bangkok? Contact your school staff, there must be something wrong. Mother, there is no mistake. I did not enlist in the college of agriculture. Why are you doing this? I'm not going to the university here. I'm going to Bangkok. Why did you not discuss it with me? You'll like it there. If you go there with me, ...I'll help you. I think your mother will understand you. Dad, I really don't want to disappoint her. Tan, eat a lot. In Bangkok, it may be hard to eat like this. You mean, you are allowing me to study in Bangkok? Yes. Thank you, Mom. I'm also happy. Eat first! Hello, Uncle Wat. Your Mother said that you want to study in Bangkok. Journalism. Nice. Do you like it? I am giving this bike as my gift to you. Before you leave... This bike ...I'll bring it to the station. And the helmet. You must always wear a helmet, it's dangerous there. But maybe she will not agree. I will talk to her, she will agree. Thank you, Uncle Wat. Let me help. Put it inside. Thank you, Uncle Wat. Glad I could be of help. The bus is leaving. Mom, I'm going. Uncle, Aunt, please take care of my mother. Soon I'll bring your mother to see you in Bangkok. Study hard and take care of yourself. Do not forget to pray to your father, he will take care of you. Don't worry, I will not forget. Quick, I am so hungry already. Let's sit. How. Strange? Do you eat meat? Yes. I ordered food for you. Here's how people in Bangkok eats. 1, 2, 3. Bank. This clothes are too tight, what do you think? It's the trend here, fit and not loose. Do everyone wear clothes like this? Yes, do not be tacky. You look cool. OK, have a change of clothes. It's time to meet new friends. Where? Bank, here. Don't you feel lucky to be my friend? We want to go home? I often seduce girls only on facebook, girls are all real here. Tomorrow morning is the orientation for new students, we shouldn't be drinking. Let's drink a little, it will be okay. Take a little sip first. Come drink. So bitter. After a while drinking will be easy. It's late. Stop. Do you know what time it is? Eight O Clock. You're late, are you still going to study here? Yes. Say that out loud. Yes! Tell all your friends to hear! You all. Here comes another. We have a pair. Hold out your hand. Quickly. Hold them out. Okay, first of all you eat. After eating, there will be two activities. Why didn't you wake me? Damn! I did wake you, but you have no reaction. I shook you a couple of times. You're still asleep. If I were you, you should have kicked him. Let's see if he won't wake up. Now you are a dog and with a cat as a partner. Cat? My name is June, and I'm not a cat. What did you say? You want to go home early? Yes... I need volunteers to do a show. If I like the performance, then you can go home early. Okay. What is important is the show right? / Yes. Give applause. Help their makeup. I can not dance. We are together in this, be helpful. Dancing is good. Do you want to learn to dance with them? Yes. I can not. Please, I want to go home early. We want to dance. Come applause, ready, 3, 4. Wait, we don't want to dance alone. You have to dance too. Yes. Ready, 3, 4. Where are you going? Anywhere my bike and feet lead me. Alone? My friends are busy. If I wait for them, I'll waste my time. Today was fun. I'll go ahead. Bye. It's a great university, Mom. Only that I hardly know anyone. Mom, I want to buy an i-phone. It has many features, I can send email. I can see you through Skype. I'll see if we have the budget for it. Well, I'm not rushing you. Call me often, ok? I want to know if you're okay there. Thank you mom. Tan... Tan. You should pay the cost of water and electricity bills. Thank you. Anything else? When can we pay the cost of the fertilizer? When we sell the strawberries then we can pay. Can it be put on hold? It's okay. Matt, he told me to tell you. If you want to sell the land, remember to contact him. I'm going now. All of you read the first chapter. The cost of living is 300 baht every day. And 300 baht is not enough. If you pass, a minimum salary of 15,000 baht. / Yes, it was him. Let me see. He's that guy from yesterday. What's that? There are 2000 likes. Delete it. Bring it over here. Im going now. What? June. June, look. Who uploaded this on youtube? If these two continue to share it, everyone will know. It can no longer be deleted. In a few days for sure people will forget it. People will forget after a few days. Let's go somewhere. Where we can celebrate our first meeting. Drink it up, drink more. He could not drink anymore. Are you still okay? Yes. I want to know how it feels. Tan is really a good kid. Let me tell you why. He's just school... and house... school and house Jade? / Yes. I'm Lei, please sit down. / Thank you. I lost something. What is it? I lost my... Heart... How many times have you used those pickup lines? I'll go to the toilet. Are you going to throw up? Or is he mocking me? Both of them. Bank, check on Tan. June, I am with Ying. Hey, look at that? So funny. Video it. It's cruelty, It's not funny. This is cute. We both pretty much have the same fate. No mother to protect us. Listen, if people will tease you, Just... bite them, bite! Tan... Tan... You are a moment spoiler. I do not want to play anymore with the dog. Tan... Tan... Tan. When you wake up, here's breakfast. See you later at school, June. Matt, you work really seriously. Watt. How can I not work hard? We need to keep up with your orders your produce have good quality so ...I am happy that you are my supplier. It's me who should be thankful to you. If you do not often buy our strawberry. My farm will go bankrupt. Tun and I know each other eversince we were kids. If there is anything that you'll need from me. You know, I'm willing to help. No matter how busy I am, just contact me. Take care of yourself. Kak Mat, what is it? Wait. Hey you! What are you drawing? Who is it? June, you surprised me. What are you looking at? You look different today. It's the clothes, I changed my style. Tan, do you have time? Yes, why? Let's watch a movie. Do you want to? It's starting to play. Come quickly! Here is the money for the strawberries. / Thank you. Why do you look different? Today you are more beautiful. Ah, I'm from the salon, where women usually go. Matt, let's eat. Okay. I envy them. Watt, Im considering to move in the city? I want to discuss about the land and strawberry tree. With pleasure. Matt later allow me to invite you to eat. Please come. Tan, what can you say about the movie? It's bad, what kind of movie was that? I didn't understand what the story is about. Films like this get awards? Yes. June. Kak Orn. Thank you for watching my movie. The movie was good. I'll go ahead. Hey, do you want to go or not? June, who is she? Kak Orn, my cousin. 4 years older than me. She is the director of the film. This one. I'll make a new facebook account... ...for seducing girls. You're not afraid of getting caught by Ying? Do not worry. The photos and name are fakes. The infos are also false. Ying would not know. Nice. Tan. Have you found a girl? Yes, it looks like I already did. This is the first. Her name? Lisa. Delicious. I'll often make food for you. Tan, what is the name of this dog? Tan. Did you hear? His name is... What? Kapong. Because when we found him... His tail is... full of cans (Kapong). Kapong. Kapong? It may also... Pong... Pong... Kapong... June. May I ask you a favor? Yes, what is it? I'm interested in the film club. I want to join the club of Kak Orn to know more about movies. You said you do not like her movie? Now I am interested. We join the club... ...so that I can understand it more. Right? I will be able to understand the movie. You like Kak Orn. If you really want to, then you register yourself. If you won't introduce me to Kak Orn... maybe... she will not accept me in the club. Please, June. I would do anything for you. Really, what will you do for me? Matt, look at this. All strawberry trees are dying. All is dry. Matt, what's left is only this. The rest of the plantation is also the same. Hello, mom. Are you okay? I'm fine. I am enjoying college here. I learned many new things. Life here is good. But the relationship between people are rather strange. Mom you do not have to worry about me. I have quickly adapted here. I miss you, -your son Tan. The ship is leaving. Buy your ticket. June, wait. What are you doing? Did you ride your bike from bangkok? You said... I may ride a bike... to the port. I mean, a bike ride in the island. Not ride a bike from bangkok to here. I'm here now. Can you still ride a bike later? Back home I often ride a bike everywhere. But now... a break... first. I'm out of breath. Let's go. Buy yout ticket, the boat is leaving. 2 tickets please. I'll treat you this time. Nice. This is mine. Quick. Well, this. See, there. 1, 2, 3. Pose 1, 2, 3. June, what time is the ship leaving? 5pm. What time is it? It's five... Five O Clock, gosh. June, what time will the boat be back? Tomorrow. It seems that you're so relaxed, you're not worried. Why worry? Today. I can sit on the beach and look at the ocean. Tan, do you know? That my dream is... to go around the world. Just sight seeing. Sight Seeing? Where are you going? Look at this. (100 Must Places to Visit) All of it? If you want to visit all those places... ...then just be a tourist. Yes. So, it'll just be a dream. Tan, what is your dream? I do not know. I never thought about it. But not to be at home for sure I do not want to farm. I do not want to be just a shadow of anyone. June, I envy you. You know what you want. Tan, do you know? I've almost died. One time when I was a kid, ...I was swimming. Then I sank. When I was about to drown. Kak Orn help me. Our life is full of uncertainy. So we should take the opportunity to do the things we like... ...before we die. Change pose, 1, 2, 3. June, we'll just stay here? Yes. I want to stay with my boyfriend. Just joking. You're being crazy again. On the beach we could see the magnificent stars. But I want to know. How the sea looks under the light of the stars, maybe underneath the waters? Perhaps it's all dark, invisible, nothing. Stars cannot be seen under the sea. To see the stars in the sea... we need to rent a boat... So you can go to the middle of the ocean. I think I'm ridiculous. No, I'm ridiculous. You like movies, and good taste in clothes. June. Kak Orn. June, you look really pretty. Im happy that the two of you will help me in filming. Okay. Order what you want. Tan you order. I'm full. On me. Oh yes? I want everything in the menu. Just joking. The movie actor... this should be complete by now. June and Tan, right? Yes. You contact the people in this list. There is a phone number. Other suggestions? Can we shoot outside? It's okay if there are still funds. We really need a change of location. We can't. It should be outside the school. I have an idea. We can film at my house in Chiang Mai. The scenery there is very beautiful. We can eat and stay there for free. Are you serious? You what? Can we? We can do that. Thank you. Thanks for trying to help me. For me, this film is very important. You're my saving star. Hey, let's go. Tan. Bag. Excuse me, I want to find June. Yes, I'm coming. We're going. Let's go. Where's your Bike? This bike? I'll sit behind. It will spend up my energy. Your energy will be spent? In the first place, I don't want to join the movie club. If I won't sit behind... then you can go alone ...go ahead. Wait. Hold on tight. Why? The road is bad. Bye father, mother. Just like the old recipe, add the milk. Just a little, to make it sweet. Are you thirsty? Add the milk. Beautiful, June. Me? I mean the bike. Look. What's that in the back? Water bottle holder. June. That looks so good. Tan, look here. There is an exhibition of works of art. What? Works of art and paintings. Let's see it. See this painting. It's very good. Very thorough. The material is natural. Do not touch. It's not allowed to touch. The painting is beautiful. Yes, beautiful. Tan. Tan, look here. Quickly here. Tan. Sea at night, Have you seen anything as beautiful as this? It's really beautiful. Standing right here, I can feel the beautiful scenery. Later we see this again huh? Okay. Why is it deflated? It's not due to my weight. It's not because of you. It's because this is an old bike. What now? Tire bursted. June, come here. Look at this bike? See. Nice bike, though your old bike is better. Stupid, you can't compare an old bike to a new one. The color is also nice. The color is good. Whose bike is this? That guy. It's an old brand. Yes, see. This is hard to find anymore. Son. Is that bike yours? Are you selling it? If I sell it, What will I ride? It's easy. You can pick any bike in my shop. In exchange to yours. I can pick any bike? Yes. You don't. Why? We are not selling it. We are here for repair only. Ok, but if you want to sell it... just contact... me. This bike is... From Italy. Italy? I can't believe it. I thought no one would want this old bike. People are like that. A lot of people will want a new one. But some would love the old one. Yes, just like me. I want to eat fried pumpkin. Why? That food is typical in my village. Everyday my mom cooks it for me. I was tired of it. So the idea of going to college here made me so happy. But now I miss my mother's cooking. Matt. Next week I'm going to Bangkok. You want to see Tan? What is it? Matt. It's okay. I'm not sure... I'm doing a lot of things right now... I can't. I understand. But don't you really want my help? Have a taste of this. Matt, why? Let me see. Sorry. Did you make this strawberry Jam? It's delicious. Yes, we did. And we teach people how to make it. Yes, you can join our class. Thank you. What is it? I found the solution. What? You must get ideas from others. See. I want to learn this, it's just 2 days. That's good. How are you? Today I'll teach you how... Oil, still need oil? Cut it in half. Slow down. If there are tofu, fried it together. Tofu? What's that? Dad, Mom, what is tofu? Every time it's the same. Mr. Song? Can I deliver it tomorrow? You want 10 boxes? Maybe wait 2-3 days. Dad, Mom. Here, taste this. Yes. Quickly, taste. How is it? How is it? It's delicious. It should be eaten with rice. Nope. Later I'll make it again for you. You're just making us taste it? Tan. June. June. Kak Orn asked me to eat out with her. Nice. June, what is it? I brought leftover food for Kapong. It looks good. This is what I believe... We should do something that has never been done before. If not, we won't learn anything new. That is how to develop ourselves. You are really clever and beautiful. You don't have to tell me that, let's eat. Tan. You exchanged your bike with a new one? Cool, right? He said this bike is stainless steel. June, see, it is very light. Your heart is not satisfied? Sometimes, new is not necessarily suitable. June. June. Tan. Draw me as a cartoon. I don't want to. If it doesn't look like you, you'll yell at me. I won't. I want to know how I look like as a cartoon. C'mon. Prarinda... Please stay for a while. Okay. I'll go ahead. Bye June. I'm meeting Kak Orn. Bye. Foreign scholarship. I've seen your good grades. I think you are most suited. For this scholarship to Japan. Read this at home, and then discuss it with your parents. Tell me your decision immediately. Okay. Hello, mom. It's been a week that I have no news of you... ...and you don't call. I've been busy lately. I am helping seniors to make a movie. I do not have time. You said you would often phone me. Who could he be? He's just helping us. Is that so? I can't reach you. Tan, are you okay? You have changed a lot. We have been through this. Goodbye. Slowly, Let me help. Put it down first. What is it, Matt? Come upstairs, I'll check it. Slowly. Without your help, for sure it will be harder for me. It's okay. There are many orders of strawberry jams. I need to carry a lot of materials. Do not forget. That you're a woman. You shouldn't carry heavy items. You need someone who can take care of you. Mrs. Mat, please take your medicine. The doctor gave you blood pressure lowering drugs and booster. 2 times a day, 2 capsules each time. Drink it after breakfast and dinner. Thank you. Tan, how are you? It's okay. Kak Orn, let me help you. Hello mom. Kak Orn. Hello, ma'am. How are you? This is Kak Orn, the director of this film. Thank you for lending us this place. I'm glad you are here. / Sorry. Kak Orn, here. This is my house. June, you'll be sleeping on the floor. Okay. It is common in the village. It seems too small... nice... but the weather. Can I help you? Come, help in tasting. Kin, you do the others. Taste this. This one? Tell me if it's good? It is delicious. Ready. Action. Come spend. Cut. Uncle. Be a little serious, okay? Action. Cut. Let the actor finish speaking. Cut for a while, you just keep talking. Cut. Uncle, you may continue drinking. Cut. Blow here. It's hard. Yes, thank you. Great, the fire is alive. See, their seeds have grown. Cut. Aunt, Uncle, once again... please... more natural dialogue. Go-go. Want to eat snack? Thank you. Okay, Do you guys want? June... June... Stay off there, we are filming. Sorry. I hope you won't just barge in the set. Farewell Letters. I don't want to ever leave Chiang Mai. Any other place is not home. Every time I am lonely, I just think of your face ...suddenly I'm fine. Because I know we will be together again soon... farewell. This letter is part of this house. Tan's father wrote this letter... ...and I love it. It has became part of us eversince. Until the time he died. When Tan was born, his father died. Tan did not tell you? No. Sit down. Okay. Actually, his father is a good writer. But unfortunately. My mother didn't like him. I wish someone will write me letters like that. His writing is really deep and elegant. Before Tan's father died. He wrote me a letter. You know June? To this day, every word in that letter... stabs me in my heart... But it gave me the spirit to survive. It's hard to believe. That a simple letter can mean a lot. It's very cozy here. I do not even want to go back to Bangkok. You may come here anytime. Yes. This tree looks good. Very good. 1, 2, 3. You're getting fat? Please open the door. Thank you. Later we will be together. Tan. Can't you stay a few more days here? The school is off, why are you rushing back to Bangkok? We didn't have the chance to talk for a longer time. I still have many things to do in Bangkok I'm going now. / Wait... Orn is a beautiful girl, is she...? Nope. She is not my girlfriend. Do you want to tell me anything? No, nothing. I am being a good boy. So don't worry about me, I'm going Mom. Wait a minute. Tan. Let's get in first. / Bye. Bye. Yes. Quick, let's go. We need to be back early. Tan. Tan. They did not let me go. Even at your age? So you are still going back to Chiang Mai? With Tan. When are you going? Very good. Don't you think? Is it okay? And, and... Hey pour me as well. What about the film? It's ok... we can start editing. Soon. Can we finish it by valentine's day? Maybe. It depends on him. Can we meet? What? I'm still busy with my friends. Okay, take care of yourself. I should not have come here. / I'd rather roam the town with you. Dad, Mom, I'm home. Where have you been? With a friend. Have you decided on the scholarship to Japan? We have no problem about it. What's your plan? Actually I can't decide yet. Weird. Why weird? You were so excited before to have it. Why suddenly so hesitant now? It's not your character. Mom. What is it, my girl? I don't like this feeling. I do not know what to do. Do not cry, it's okay. Do not cry. Have you eaten? Yes. I'll go to my room. Eat, eat. I have a gift for you. As a token of my thanks for helping me in filming. Kak Orn, thank you. Do you like it? How did you know I want this? If you really like it, use it often. What do you call it? Janpan. Remember to draw something for me. Japan. Kapong. Add as a friend. June. So you are just in here. Tan. What is it? I want to tell you something. Tell me. Kak Orn asked me to be an actor in her film. She said I would love it... ...and could do it well. But I'm not decided yet. What do you think? Just do the things you like. Not what Kak Orn likes. Wait, June. June... June... You are right. But I do not know what I like. That's why I come shooting with Kak Orn... ...to know what I like. You understand? June, see. A gift from Kak Orn. I will be able to draw good cartoons with this. Kak Orn really understands me. You have to be true in what you like. Know what you need in your life. Otherwise, you'll just be following someone's only. You'll never have your own confidence. June. This is your new girlfriend? What happened to Jade? We split up. When? You are just like changing clothes with your girlfriends. That's my life. Finding true love is not easy. I'm still looking for ms.right. Half of life is now over but I haven't found her yet. Thank you very much. Can I take? Very good. Thank you. Your film will be shown just in time for Valentine's Day. Do you think my work is good? Of Course. Tan. Do not forget the 18th death anniversary of your father. Saturday? Okay, glad I could help. Tan... Tan... Ying. Tan. Do you know where June is? It's been many days that she's not in our class. She did not tell you? She has a scholarship to Japan. I'll go ahead. C'mon lets go to the mall. We'll send you off tomorrow at 5 am...-Dad. Tan. Have a taste of mother's strawberry jam. It's very good. You are not eating much. Mom, I'm sleepy. I'll sleep first. Hello, Kak Orn. Sorry, I'm a bit busy lately... a lot of people is interested... in my movie. I'm very busy but happy as well. Too busy to answer your phone? I have shooting day and Night. I'm tired, I need to rest now. Kak Orn. Sorry, I can't help but overhear. A call with your girlfriend? I told you. She's not my girlfriend. Or anything. If she's not your girlfriend, she won't affect you like that. That can affect your studies as well. You need to consider if it's all worth it. Whatever I do I can't satisfy you. I can never be as good as Dad. What are you saying? Mom you always think of me as a substitute of my father. I do not want to disappoint you. But I just can't do everything you want. No one can really replace anyone. Son, you don't understand. Look at you keeping this farm. This farm is my father's dream, right? That's why you work so hard. But is this what you really want to do? Or just to fulfill the dreams of my long dead father? Be careful on the road. Tan. You're not really suited for her. You're just like her errand boy. You need to decide. June has treated you and your dog well. That dog there. Dog, look. When you wake up tomorrow morning, tell me then that you've never loved her. Come drink. You want to pass on your wealth to whom? Tan my only son, everything to him. Tan. Please sign in here. Later, the documents will be delivered to you. Thank you. Tan, where are you? When we woke up, you're not here. We thought you drowned in the water. I do not know, I'm on a small island. What are you doing there? Why? You feel lonely? When will you reply back? Kapong and I are waiting. Hello, June? This is your Uncle, listen carefully. Tan. Mom, eat a lot. Uncle, do you like my mother? Yes. Why don't you tell her? She already have her beloved someone. And that's you. Things have been better, just rest at home. Do not work hard. Thank you. / You're welcome. Slow down, mom. Thank you, Wat. I have to go now. Tan, take good care of your mother. If there is anything you need, call me. Thank you. Mom, take your medicine after eating rice. Tan, I want to see our farm record book. Bring it over here. You just came from the hospital, the doctor said... It's not working, I just want to see the books. You are stubborn mother, where is it? Inside the drawers. I really miss you, Tun. It feels like my heart will break into pieces. But do not worry. I will be strong so that I can give our son a happy life. I will assure you that he will have wonderful future. I promise. You know Tun? No matter how lonely and difficult my life is without you. Seeing that cheerful smile of our child... all my suffering disappears. Tan's smile gives me the strength to overcome my difficulties. This is the first time that Tan and I will be apart. I am all alone at home. Tan chose to go to college in Bangkok. At first, I did not want him to go to Bangkok. I'm worried that something bad will happen to him in Bangkok. But I know I can not keep him here. Men should get out to see the world. Is my decision correct Tun? Now the only thing I'm worried about is... in a few days ...we will no longer have the money. For Tan's classes in Bangkok. It's really expensive. But if I will sell the farm, then he can finish his studies. I want to sell it, but eventually I changed my mind. Because this land is very important to me. I want Tan to inherit it. To keep up with his expenses. I decided to sell strawberry jam... ...and it helps getting us by. But the work is very tiring. Nowadays Tan seldom visit home... ...and do not even call. I almost cannot stand it anymore. However, no matter how much it pains me, I need to toughen up. Though I am crying now I will keep my vow to you. Mom. I'm sorry. It's okay. Mom, have a taste of this hot fried pumpkin. It looks good. My cooking is delicious, eat a lot. You're going back to college. When are you leaving for Bangkok? Everything is okay now. Mom, I want to enrol in the college of agriculture here... so that soon after I can help you here. You don't have to do that. Why? Listen to your mother. I do not want you to do the things I want... ...but rather what do you want I've realized it and it's clear to me now. You are right, you have your own life and dreams to pursue. Follow your heart. You can fulfill the dream of your father on your own way and not necessarily of mine. Just to know that you want to stay here and farm with me... Is enough to make me feel very happy. Hello. You need to find the meaning of your life. Pursue your dreams. Find the things you want in life. Thank you. Tan's little tree. It's June address in Japan. Thank you. One for me please. Excuse me, can I get aboard? C'mon. Really? / Yes. Okay, this way. Thank you. Sorry. I want to go here, please? Okay, okay. Tell me if there is a problem. Okay. / Thank you. Excuse me. The painting of the sea and stars, is it no longer here? The painting has been sold already. What is this? The sea and the stars. Beautiful. Beautiful? Hello, we're here. Okay. You've finally reached that place you are dreaming of. How I wish you are here with me. It's so beautiful here. Tell me about it in person when you come home. I'll be waiting here for you. Tan? It's me Kak Orn. Help! Why must it happen to her? I know how you feel, Tan. Thank you. Thank you. My condolences. Thank you for coming over here. I believe, my daughter was happy before she left. Though I did not tell it to them. I both love Tan and Orn. I'll name my facebook account Kapong, our dog. Here I will express my feelings. I'm been trying to make Tan love me, but to no avail. Finally I decided to take this last chance. I added him as a friend on Facebook. I hope that if Tan accept my friend request before I leave for Japan. He will know about all of my feelings. And leave what will happen next to fate. Today Tan said he wants to eat vegetable fried pumpkin. This is the first time that I tried learning how to cook. Many times I failed. But luckily, at last... Tan did not enjoy it though, but our dog Kapong did. When I was at Tan's home, I saw this little tree. It looks good. Her mother taught me... How to take care of a tree. And gave me this one to take care of. It's now growing taller. To care for something and see it grow... makes us happy... is'nt it? Tan's old bike is really nice. Tan did not realize the value of memories that came with it. It keeps our memories. And if one day... he forgets our happy moments together ...this old bike will bring it all back to him. Because kak Orn is busy filming. She told me to buy a gift for him. It took a long time for me to decide what to buy. And I think Crayons Janpan is the most suitable gift. Tan could make good use of Crayons Janpan. I love his drawings. I really do. Sometimes... I think drawing is his true passion. He would often draw. No matter when, or wherever. Hello, Tan. There are some things that I want to tell you. I just want to say, in the past days since. ...I knew you. Every time we do things together, It made me feel very happy. I... hope... that you will find someone that will make you feel happy doing things with her too. ...that will make me happy too. Why do I keep crying? I'm very lucky to know you. That we had the opportunity to meet, and the opportunity to love you. Although this is just a thought. Bye. June. Once you asked me to draw you as a cartoon... because you want to know how you look like as a cartoon here's how you look like in my heart. Miss you much. Tan. June, I am doing now the things I like. I know in our lives, we may not have a lot of good opportunities. And that if we miss them they may not come by again anymore. June, you taught me to understand the value of life... even the most common things in life. They make me feel like you're always at my side. I also want to go to the places in your dreams. Come with me. Be careful on the road, son. Take care mother. Okay. Dah. Now I want to ride a bike to see the stars and the ocean. You know June? You help me realize my dreams... and the things that will make me happy. I know our love, like the stars on the ocean, will always continue to shine... Forever. I will miss you, Tan.
