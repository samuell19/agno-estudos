(ominous music) (faint whirring) (whooshing) (clanking) (sizzling) (rock music) (distant sirens wailing) - [Man] Steve man, come on. Come on let's go! - To hell with you guys. I'm staying! What's the matter? (zapping) (energy sizzling) - Howdy, folks, come on into James Bar. We got everything you want, beer, whiskey, crack, heroin, it's all here, you name it. It's all legal and it's all here, so come on in. Bring your wife, bring your girlfriend, bring them both. - [Man] Hey, Jenny, hey. - Alright, now how many times do I have to tell you guys no drinks on the table. - Get out of here, you mooch. I'll give you a lead enema. - I think table three could use more nachos. - Put that away, dick head. - Relax. - That thing's hot, man, that's the piece I used to cap that old man. - There's nothing to worry about, we got away clean. (tense music) (energetic rock music) (brooding music) (cyber beeping) - What the hell is that? - I am Unit Seven of the Federal Division of Core Trackers. You, Frank Douglas Rowe, have been found guilty of murder by the United States Computerized Judicial System, in accordance with penal code 1-2-0-0-6-7. - Now wait a minute! - You are to be executed, now. (suspenseful music) - I'm innocent! You got the wrong guy! The wrong guy! Oh, help me man, help me! (gun firing) (furniture clattering) (clamoring) (guns firing) (cyber beeping) (gun firing) (clamoring) (tense music) (tires screeching) (cyber beeping) - [Man] Hey! (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) - You James Donald Cooley have been convicted of murder by the United States Computerized Judicial System. In accordance with penal code 1-2-2-0-6-7, you are to be executed, now. (cyber beeping) (rocket whooshing) (explosion booming) (rocket whooshing) (explosions booming) (dramatic music) (flames roaring) (protestors clamoring) - No more, no more! (whistling) - No more! (helicopter chuffing) - He's here. Secure your positions. (tense music) (helicopter chuffing) - No more, no more, no! - No more! (protestors clamoring) (eerie tense music) (protestors clamoring) - No more! - Hi I'm Connie Griffith from Internews. Outside Cybercore Industry teams of protestors gather to express their disapproval with the country's newly appointed Computerized Judicial System, a faction created by Cybercore, and inducted into the judicial system eight months ago. The strongest supporter of computerized justice is Senator Bob Dilly, who is making his way into the press conference podium right now. - [Bob] Hi, how are you, really nice to meet you. (tense music) - Ladies and gentlemen settle please! (protestors booing) It is my pleasure to introduce Senator Robert Dilly. (applauding) (protestors booing) - Position check. - Stage right secure. - Stage left secure. - Thank you, thank you very much, it's a, welcome, why don't we, why don't we open it up for questions right away. - Senator Dilly, don't you feel that computerized justice is a blatant demoralization of the constitution? - I feel that computerized justice, is a misuse of terms. - Computers can't make life and death decisions! - Justice isn't run by computers, it is organized and distributed by computers, but those computers were programmed by men! - Computers killed my brother! - You're killing people! (protestors shouting) - We're tight boys, got a lot of angry little faces out here today. (tense music) - Well what about the Constitution? - The Constitution was written over 225 years ago, when the entire country had less of a population than this city. - [Man] Ross this is Romero, we have a security guard here that says we have an unauthorized vehicle in sector five. Want you to check it out. - Negative, it's too hot down here. - It might be something. - Stay the line. - Danner, cover me I'm gonna check it out. - Phillips stay at your post! - [Phillips] I got a feeling Ross. - There are 20 murders a day in this city. That's a hell of a lot of trials. A lot of trials, a lot of manpower, a lot of money that we just don't have. (tense music) - Are you sure we're doing the right thing Nick? - Yes dammit, from (mumbles). (mechanism clacking) - Killing Dilly ain't gonna stop the system. - No, but it'll slow it down. - It's a statement. - We're going through with the plan. (tense music) - Phillips come in. - Phillips! - What's going on? - A-2-7 unauthorized vehicle on the roof, code yellow. Secure. - Senator Dilly, do you think that Mr. Rounds, as Chairman of Cybercore, would care to reveal how much money his company made when they merged with the United States government? - Miss Griffith, that question has no bearing on this news conference. We are here to discuss cybernetics, the wave of the future, the wave of justice. You want to talk about preventing deaths? How about preventing the deaths of innocent policemen killed in the line of duty? Core Tracker is the first step in preventing that. - So we file in all the facts and let the computers come up with the verdict. - Yes Miss Griffith, and the sentence is then carried out. - By robot executioners. (protestors clamoring) - By Core Tracker. - Mark, Matt, two minutes. - What's next Mr. Dilly, cyborg teachers, cyborg doctors? - How about cyborg reporters? - Mr. Dilly do you feel the cybernetics industry is advanced enough for this type of responsibility? - I feel Cybercore. They are the spearhead company in the field. - [Man] You're lying Senator, why are you lying to us? - [Bob] Every legal explanation is (mumbles). (tense music) (Bob lecturing) Nothing had been uncovered (mumbles). - [Connie] Senator what happens when (mumbles). - Faith, faith is for churchgoers. (mumbling) There's nothing to worry about. (suspenseful music) - Guard! (grunting) (dramatic choir singing) (grunting) (hits thudding) (gun firing) (water splashing) (hits thudding) (grunting) (machine gun firing) (screaming) (glass shattering) (screaming) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (machine gun firing) (gun firing) (machine gun firing) (grunting) - Hold on! (helicopter whirring) (machine gun firing) (somber music) (siren wailing) (tense music) (rocket whooshing) (explosion booming) (tense music) (machine gun firing) (tires screeching) (machine gun firing) Secret Service, get out of the car! (uneven tense music) (machine gun firing) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) (machine gun firing) (crashing) (metallic rumbling) (explosion booming) (tense music) (siren wailing) (somber music) (police radio chattering) - The terrorists are said to be members of a covert radical group who oppose computerized justice. They call themselves UHR, Union for Human Rights. Some people may disagree with the tactics they displayed here today, but other people believe they are necessary. Meanwhile we just had confirmed reports that all UHR members were killed. I'm Connie Griffith, reporting. - No... - [Man] Senator do you feel this was a UHR incident? - Of course it was a UHR attack. Union of Human Rights indeed, what a joke. What about my rights? Aren't I human? - Were you hurt Senator? - No I wasn't, and I owe that to Eric. I want you to meet Agent Eric Phillips, he's the head of our Secret Service detachment. Good work. - Do you intend on striking back sir? - We'll let the law take care of that. Well, that's all for now boys. - Okay we get it. - [Man] I got it. - [Man] Goodnight Senator. (reporters chattering) - Let's get one thing straight. You've been with the team for what, three months now? You and your bunch of SS boys are nothing more than, window dressing. I've been Head of Security for the senator for six years. - Then you should have checked that car out and called in the code yellow. - Well you know I don't need to explain my actions to you Phillips, but, when I'm operating with a limited team, I don't have time to check out every nook and cranny! - If the senator gets killed, your excuses are gonna look great on your resume. - Well I'll tell you what. You ever leave your post again, you'll answer to me. (laughing) - Great work Eric! - Thanks Senator, just doing my job. (chuckling) - Just doing your job huh? You saved my butt twice in one day. Better watch out for this kid. We'll see you tomorrow. - [Ross] I'm telling you Senator, I don't think he's ready yet. - Well he sure was ready this afternoon. More than I can say for you, by the way. - We don't know enough about this guy, we don't know how loyal he is! - We know how good he is. He showed us that today. What are you afraid of, are you afraid he's better than you, afraid he's gonna take your job away Ross? - Phillips is nothing more than an impulsive, hot-headed amateur. Now I think bringing him into the fold at this time is a big mistake. - This kid has got something special, and I want him on my side! If we have trouble with him I want to find out now! Before he gets in too close. - Well if that is the case, and he is a problem, then you leave him to me. (brooding music) - Okay. - Lights Agnes. - Good evening sir. Welcome home. - Any messages? - None sir. - So what else is new? - How was your day? I see. Intranews said you saved the senator's life today. - Yeah I'm a real hero. - I detect a touch of sarcasm. - (sighs) That's what I like about you Agnes, you're perceptive. - Have I done something to upset you sir? - No I'm sorry. How was your day? - Enjoyable. I refused my faulty Ebbins circuit and Mr. Perkins next door replaced his old terminal with a new Mary 6000. She's a charming little system, we had a nice chat. - Want a drink Aggy? - I really shouldn't. - (sighs) Come on, we got the whole night ahead of us. Let's get drunk. - We did last night, you just got more depressed. - Come on, indulge me. - Okay, no higher than 5%. (beeping) (cyber whirring) Eric, I said 5%. This is too much, perception-- (beeping) What was I going to say? - You love me. - I love you Eric. (sighing) (pensive music) - Aggy. - Agnes 4000, yes that's my name, don't overdue it, I mean wear it out (giggles). - Recall November 23rd, 2014, 11:34 p.m., camera six. - [Agnes] Oh Eric (hiccuping). - Excuse you. - Why do you want to punish yourself? - I didn't ask for your opinion Agnes. - Very well. (poignant music) - Hi. What are you making? - [Woman] Stew. It's your favorite. - Aren't you gonna turn around? - [Woman] I saw it on the news. - I'm okay. - [Woman] You're always okay. - Are you all right? - I'm sorry. - Why? - Another scar to add to your collection? - I'm all right! - Well I'm not! I'm married to a man whose job is to be willing to die at any given moment, for any given reason! - Jeez do we have to keep going through this? - What kind of a life is that? - You knew what I did when you married me! - No! You were an investigator when I married you, not, not a bodyguard! Look I just can't live my life waiting for you to walk through that door dead or alive. - Hey don't talk like that just relax! - There's no point in arguing, is there? (strained music) I love you. I love you. I love you. (poignant music) - Agnes water. (water splashing) I love you too Katy. Aggy, sleep. (whirring) (zapping) (crickets chirping) (brooding music) (cyber beeping) (keyboard clacking) (beeping) (door clattering) - Doctor, is that you? (dramatic music) (gasping) (injector hissing) - Eric, Eric! Wake up! - What is it? - Priority call, Senator Dilly. (tense music) - Hello? - Hi Eric it's Bob. Something's come up, would you please come down here? - Yes sir. (tense music) - Sorry to get you out of bed so early Eric. - What's wrong Senator? - Well I know you've only been with us for a short time, but you're really becoming part of the family, right Mike? - Yes sir. - And this is a family, Eric. It's tight like a family. There's certain information, that we share with each other, that we don't share with everybody else, right Mike? - Yes sir. - See loyalty is what makes a unit strong, impregnable, unbreakable loyalty. Some of us have it, some of us don't. (dramatic music) We're talking about loyalty. You haven't learned about. (gasping) - What are you doing? - Tried to have me killed. - What? - Your boss isn't too happy about it either. - (gasps) I didn't have anything to do with that! - Save it Miss Austin, we know all about you! We've been following you, we know that you're a member of the Union! - No, no I don't have anything to do with the Union-- - Save it! (dramatic music) Relax Eric! Relax! - No, don't trust him! - This woman knew abut the assassination attempt. - He's crazy! (tense music) Psychopath! You're out of your god damn mind! Cybercore has to be stopped! (silenced gun firing) (grunting) (dramatic music) - Don't fire, the building isn't empty! Stay with me Ross! (hits thudding) (grunting) (police radio chattering) - Chief, give me an APB on Eric Phillips. - Isn't he one of yours? What are the charges? - Murder. - You have proof? - You'll find a body in his apartment, Wilshire and Third. Gun on the floor has his prints all over it. - His prints or hydrosanc copies? - Come on Chief, since when were you so concerned with details? Just do your job, keep the peace. I'll meet at CRC in 20 minutes, we're sending out a tracker. - A tracker. (police radio chattering) (crickets chirping) (enigmatic tense music) - [Man] Why don't we talk to him, this way, come on. - I need to see the chief, it's an emergency. - Take a seat. - I said it was an emergency! - Oh that's completely different! Take a seat. - Listen to me asshole! I'm with the Secret Service, if you don't get your chief down here right now I'll have you demoted so low this desk job will seem like a wet dream! - All right just keep your pants on, all right? - All points bulletin, apprehend on contact Eric Anthony Phillips, personal ID code number 2-3-6-3-9-9-5-alpha. (beeping) (chattering) (brooding music) - Yeah, give me Chief Olsen please. Yeah Chief, it's the front desk, I got a guy down here, he wants to talk to you. He says he's with the Secret Service. - What's his name? - Eric Phillips. (tense music) Hey buddy wait a minute! (hits thudding) (grunting) - Stop him, stop that man! (police shouting) (hits thudding) (grunting) (dramatic music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (police radio chattering) (tense music) (vigorous energetic music) (sirens howling) (tires screeching) (horn honking) (tires screeching) (crashing) (tires screeching) (dramatic music) (crashing) (tires screeching) (explosion booming) (rumbling) (dramatic music) (siren wailing) (tense music) - Your problem surrounds a traitor. - I thought you took care of her. - I did. This time it's one of my boys, I got the chief on it right now. (cyber beeping) Sending out a tracker as well. - A tracker? Is that necessary? - I'm afraid so, this guy's good. (eerie tense music) (sinister music) (pulsating energy humming) - The next move that Phillips makes, will be his last. (beeping) (electronic clicking) (dramatic music) (gasping) - Just want the same thing! - Okay, same thing, right? - Yeah. - Okay. - Here you go buddy. - All right. (distant sirens wailing) (patrons chattering) (electronic clicking) - Thank you. Enter your voice code. - Voice code 8-2-7-8-8 Eric Phillips. (electronic clicking) - Thank you. Please wait. (beeping) (tense music) Confirmed. Who are you calling? - Washington DC, Department of the Secret Service. Field Commander Charles Thompson. (electronic clicking) - Thank you. - [Vendor] Here you go pal. - Thanks. (beeping) (suspenseful music) - [Telephone] Please wait. (beeping) Please wait. (suspenseful music) - Shit! Call canceled! - Thank you. - I am Unit Five, Federal Division of Core Trackers. You, Eric Anthony Phillips, have been found guilty of murder by the United States Computerized Judicial System! - Wait, I'm a federal officer! - In accordance to penal code 1-2-2-0-6-7, you are to be executed, now. - You can't shoot me, you're breaking federal code! Screw this. (guns firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (grunting) (guns firing) (glass tinkling) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (explosion booming) (siren howling) (flames crackling) (dramatic music) - [Officer] Drop the gun! Turn around, put your hands up, up! (police radio chattering) Turn around, let's go! (grunting) (sinister music) (clacking) (zapping) (fizzing) (whirring) (electronic clicking) (cyber beeping) (eerie humming) (rapid beeping) - I'm with Secret Service! (cyber beeping) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (grunting) (siren wailing) (cyber beeping) - Stop the truck! Get off! (tires screeching) (siren wailing) (dramatic music) - I am Unit Five. I am Unit Five. (crashing) (rumbling) (explosion booming) (flames crackling) (beeping) (whirring) (popping) (fizzing) You are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are - No, you are. - to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed, you are to be executed-- (gun firing) (distorted mumbling) - Drop the gun and get in the van! - Who are you? - Do it, now! - What do you want? - Just get in the van, now! (injector hissing) (groaning) (thudding) (crickets chirping) (footsteps echoing) - I know, but I want him brought in now! I mean now! - I have an APB out on him, my people think he's a cop killer now. So if he's out there, we'll find him. - Oh, he's out there Chief Olsen. - Then it's only a matter of time. - We need another tracker. - Another tracker? - We need it to get Phillips, he's a threat. - Of course he is. He saw you kill someone. - If he's a threat to me, he's a threat to you, if you know what I mean. - Let me give you a piece of advice. Never over-estimate the power of a man. Jenny, have a seat. Men are not men anymore. Tribalism is dead, and mankind is soon to follow. Men are a bug, and what do we do with bugs? We crush them. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about power. The power over life, over the meek, the meager, the spiritless, the hollow, vacant eyes of our brain-dead children. (gasping) I'm talking about the power over death! (grunting) Over the masses, over the sheep that require domination, the society that has grown so dependent on being told what to do, it hasn't even the courage of a thought. (grunting) We're in a new generation. A generation of soul-less zombies, trained to obey, to seek nothing. (beeping) (gas hissing) (eerie tense music) What more could a god want? - [Announcer] Now more from Connie Griffith! - [Connie] The Secret Service agent apparently disappeared after the body was found inside his apartment. Here with me now is Mike Ross, Head of Cybercore Security. Mr. Ross would you say Phillips appeared to be on the edge the night of the murder? - No, just flipped out, a total break-down. You know this guy's a loose cannon, and while he's out there on the street, no one's safe. - Thank you. - Especially you Ross! - The police have issued a state-wide manhunt for Phillips, if you have any knowledge of his whereabouts, please contact the local authorities. From Cybercore, I'm Connie Griffith, for Internews. (slamming) (grunting) - Hey pal, alls you had to do was knock! - Where am I? - Hey man I... You're safe. - You're not! Now tell me where I am! - I can't say. - Who can? - Griff, but Griff aint here yet. (door clattering) - Right there asshole! Gil I told you to keep that door locked! - I did! - Just ease down cowboy! Just ease down! - He's looking for Griff. - Yo, Griff ain't here. - Look, I just want somebody to tell me what the hell's going on here! - Look, I'm sorry, we can't tell you what's going on yet. Please just try and be patient! We're not gonna hurt you! - (scoffs) Well tell him that! - Jared please put the gun down! - (sighs) Guy's dangerous, we can't trust him! - I'm dangerous? You're the one with the gun. You guys are UHR aren't you? - Yeah, yeah, we're fucking terrorists! - Look, we are with the Union, but we'll explain everything to you as soon as Griff gets here. - Who's this Griff? - Get back in the room. - Jared, put the gun down. - He was on their side Marcus! - Well he's not any more! - We don't know that! - Kid, put the gun down! (tense music) Or I'll take it away from you. - Try it. (mechanism clacking) - Now, where's Griff? - [Connie] Right here. (pensive music) - Big TV star has a secret life huh? - Something like that. Marcus, take care of his leg. - Relax, I'm a med student. - What I need is a doctor! - Yeah well you're shit out of luck. - Jared go in the other room. - Griff this is a waste of time if you ask me. - I didn't ask you. - You're lucky it's just under the skin. I'll have to cut through to get it out. - Quit talking about it, just do it! - There's only one problem. I don't have any anesthetic. (tense music) Hang in there buddy. - Ow, jeez! - Connie! - Try to relax, you'll be okay. (distant siren wailing) (grunting) - Career woman like you must have everything she wants. (grunting) What are you doing at UHR? - Try to make a change. (groaning) - Sounds pretty sappy to me. - Didn't ask you. - Okay, I got it! - Is that it? It felt a lot bigger. (clanking) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) (brooding music) (energy pulsating) (suspenseful music) (beeping) (electronic clacking) (gasping) (eerie serene music) - I've been a reporter for eight years. And I've seen the worse man has to offer, I watched the White House burn down, I covered the massacre of Greenwich Village. But the worst horror is that people becoming more and more desensitized to it all and it's, it's led to this judgment by computer that we all accept without a second thought. We're becoming programmed by the machines we've created. And you know what it's not gonna get any better until we get our justice back. (distant siren wailing) - Killing the senator, isn't gonna help your cause any. - I didn't authorize that Phillips. I was working with a connection working inside of Cybercore. - Stephanie Austin. - Yeah. Well she's uncovered some heavy information, something called Operation Echo. But before she could get it off their computer, she was... - Murdered. - We know you were set up Phillips. - What is this information? - I don't know. (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) All I know that she was willing to die to get it out, and now it's up to us to try to retrieve it. - You have someone else working inside? - No. - Well you don't really think you can get inside that place do you? - No, but you can. You've been part of Dilly's security team for three months, you can't tell me that you've never been inside of Cybercore. - Yeah, dozens of times. But I had clearance. - Then you know where the central operations lab is. - Yes, but we can't get in. - We can with this. (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) Maintenance door access code I got it from Stephanie. (computer beeping) - You people really do have a death wish don't you? - Look Phillips, time is running out! Cybercore is working its way deeper and deeper into our government, and pretty soon they are gonna be untouchable, do you understand? We gotta move now! And the way I see it, you have two choices. Either you can keep on running or you can fight with us! What are you gonna do? (eerie serene music) (cyber beeping) (whooshing) (cyber beeping) (engine revving) - Phillips takes out another one of these mechanical monsters, Rounds is not going to be happy. - Eric Phillips is dead by sunrise. - Why don't you let me guarantee that personally? - Oh no no no no no, it might be questioned. We're playing this by the book, he's a fugitive and he's sentenced to death. (footsteps echoing) - [Jared] What the hell do you mean, you told him? - We could use him Jared! - He could be using us, did you ever think of that? This could be a setup! - They're hunting him Jared! They're trying to kill him, this isn't a setup! You're losing it man! Relax! - This guy's the best chance that's come our way yet. We are not going to let him slip through our fingers! - So, is he in? - I don't know. - No, Jess listen to her honey. - Mom when are you coming home? - (sighs) Not till tomorrow. Now do as Lisa says and stop teasing the cat okay? - Okay. - I'll see you in the morning. - I love you mom! - I love you too sweety! Goodnight! (brooding music) (distant siren wailing) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) (keyboard clacking) - Wanna see something? Stephanie Austin was a close friend of mine, she got a hold of some cyber text data for me. Here, take a look at what we're up against. (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) The tracker's endo-system is some kind of hi-tempered super alloy, I mean, I'm not a metallurgist but, it's far more impermeable than any metallic compound I've ever seen. My software can't decipher the hydroxic radical that was utilized. Any theories? - Uh, I only speak English. (chuckling) - Sorry. Basically, these trackers... - Real bad asses. - Right, but what's really spectacular, (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) is the circuitry. There's got to be over a billion individual microprocessors. And what's really mouth watering, is this polymorpha-nuclear substance. - You lost me. - (chuckles) Yes I did that's my point. The tissue content is some type of poly-muric gel that acts as a protectant yet offers complete flexibility. You could put your hand right inside it, but you couldn't actually puncture it. This fucking surpasses and (mumbles) dimensions beyond any analytical, technical or otherwise formulated systematical perceptions or deductions of, of any principles, or methods of fucking science! (computer beeping) I'm lost too. - Yeah, well, thanks. - What I'm saying is, that this gel, that cyber-tech has created, is the perfect substance! The Core Tracker is the perfect android. The perfect assassin. - Oh there you are, Connie wants to see you okay? - Wait! How old are you anyway? (distant siren wailing) - 19. - Well shouldn't you be in school or something? (sighing) - Well if I was in school right now, I couldn't be here, now could I? (dramatic music) (beeping) - Marcus you're gonna be on the outside perimeter. Make sure the motor's running and you're ready to go. Once we're on the main laboratory level, this is where it's gonna get hot. We're gonna have to split up and try to find the central ops lab. - No you won't, I know where it is. I'm in. - Oh I feel better already! - What is your problem? - I'll show you what my problem is! (hits thudding) (grunting) - Phillips! - Don't make me hurt you! - Phillips! One of the men you killed at the press conference yesterday was Jared's brother! You killed his brother. (sighing) I'm sorry, I should have told you. - [Woman] Jared, wait! - Okay, let's get everybody ready Marcus, let's do this. (tense music) (beeping) - Okay Dee, Jeanie! All right let's get ready, you two go get the van started, we'll be right down. - Okay. (tense music) (ticking) (tires screeching) - [Jeanie] What was that? - [Dee] I don't know, go on, I'll check it out. (suspenseful music) (beeping) (ticking) Tracker! (explosion booming) (screaming) (thudding) (groaning) - Oh, Jesus Christ karma! (crashing) (cyber beeping) (gun firing) (grunting) - What the hell was that? - It came from downstairs! (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Tracker! Let's go, move! Let's go, hurry! (dramatic music) - Oh my god! (gun firing) (brooding music) (gun firing) (guns firing) - Go on, go on, get out of here! Do it! - Oh (groans)! - [Marcus] Come on, beat it! (guns firing) (glass breaking) (tense music) - Come on, hurry up, let's go! Come on! (grunting) (gun firing) (grunting) (door clattering) (guns firing) - Oh (groans)! (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (zapping) (sizzling) - Here! (door cracking) How do we get out of here? - Try the loading dock! - All right, just wait here! - Okay... (clattering) - Door's not gonna hold much longer! We gotta get out of here! - Get back! (gun firing) (wooden cracking) (tense music) (cyber beeping) (gun firing) (grunting) (guns firing) - Come on! (machine guns firing) (guns firing) - Eric! Eric! - Shoot! - I can't! - Safety! (guns firing) (ricochets clanking) (guns firing) (somber music) - Cover me! (guns firing) Jared! (suspenseful music) (doors banging) - Want me to help? (machine gun firing) (explosion booming) Jesus Christ! It's still alive! - Not for long! (rocket whooshing) (clattering) Let's go. - Fuck isn't this asshole dead yet? - At least the UHR is out of our hair. The tracker took them all out! - Yeah, all except for the one we wanted. - Can we get another tracker? How 'bout two? - How 'bout two? Or how 'bout three? How 'bout 300? How 'bout we stop wasting time with these mechanized meter maids, and send in the real thing? - Do you actually think you can take him down, when two trackers have failed? - Let me tell you the forgotten difference between man and the automated terrors you've constructed. Man has one thing integrated into his system no machine ever had. The will to survive. - You want him Ross? You go get him. - My pleasure. (tense music) - We gotta ditch this thing, let's go! - They're gone, all my friends. Jared, Ally, Gil. They're gone. - Come on, we gotta go. - They told us never stand a chance. - Connie! Jared and the others wouldn't want us to give up. We can still get that information you needed. - Right, the two of us breaking into Cybercore. Sounds like you're the one with the death wish now if you ask me. - I didn't ask you. (tense music) Let's go. (footsteps echoing) (tense music) Come on! Those guards will be back any second! - I can barely read this. - Let me do it! - I got it! Shit does this look like an eight? - Looks like a five. - Doesn't look like five, it looks like an eight. - [Eric] Okay eight, whatever, just hurry up! - I'm not exactly taking a coffee break here Phillips! (footsteps echoing) - They're coming! (keypad clicking) (beeping) - You were right it was a five. (door clattering) How much further? - Just a little bit. (distant machinery thumping) This way. (tense music) (computer beeping) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) You sure you know what you're doing? - (mumbles) everything he knew. (door clattering) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (hits thudding) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) (hits thudding) (grunting) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) - Let's go! - I'm almost ready! I got the file, it's restricted, I can take the disc home and break the access code there. (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) Got it! - This way! (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (police radio chattering) - What do you got there? - Ah, a purse it belongs to that chick from Intranews. And who are you? (hits thudding) (grunting) - You're fairy godmother. - [Rounds] What do you mean, stolen? - They accessed the code and copied the file. - We need to know what they know! And we've got to get it back before that Internews bitch has Echo plastered across the six o'clock news! - Ross knows where they might be. He'll take care of them. - You tell Ross I need them back here alive! - Fine. (waves splashing) (computer beeping) - Now I gotta break this access code and figure out what the hell Operation Echo is. - How long will that take? - Minutes, hours, days. (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) - Well at least you got it narrowed down. Here. - Thanks. Where's your wife? - What? Oh the ring. I'm divorced. - You still wear the ring. What happened? - I had uh, too many scars. - I think scars are sexy. I'm divorced too. My husband said I was too aggressive. So I smacked him. (chuckling) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeping) The second we break this we are going straight to network, 'cause whatever it is we are gonna bust it wide open! - Well don't get too comfortable, a lot can happen between now and then. - Yeah, but anyone that's outlasted two Core Trackers has got somebody upstairs on his side. - I'm just lucky. - I'm Irish, ah you couldn't ask for a better combination than that! (computer beeping) Oh oh this is it! My god! - I can't believe it. Is it possible? - Oh it is possible. (sinister music) Her brains will be covering that wall behind you if you take one more glance at that gun Phillips. - I thought you said you were lucky? (eerie foreboding music) - Well done Mr. Ross, very well done. Very close, Miss Griffith. Closer than anyone has ever come to me before. - I get nauseous just thinking about it. - You've proven yourself to be one hell of an adversary. Mr. Phillips, you've shown you have quite some spirit. Pity you weren't working for Cybercorp. - If I was, I'd be out of a job tomorrow. - Oh? And why is that? - Because tonight, I'm gonna burn it down. (tense music) - Of course you are. Now then, I have one simple question. If answered correctly, it might save you some pain. Did you make a second copy of Echo, and if so where is it? (tense music) Ross. The cat's got their tongue. Ross not him. (suspenseful music) Leaving our party, Senator? - I have uh, a rally at eight a.m., and I don't want to sit here and watch you torture two people to death. I do have a touch of humanity left. (suspenseful music) Say Eric, if you would have played your cards right, you could have had his job in no time. - Chief? What about you? - I've got a few minutes. - Ah... (suspenseful music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (gun firing) (grunting) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (gun firing) (hits thudding) (grunting) (gun firing) (grunting) (Connie groaning) - Oh... - It's just a graze. Keep pressure here, you'll be all right. (footsteps echoing) (door clattering) (footsteps echoing) Come on! (groaning) (tense music) - Okay Phillips it's time. Let's see what you got. What's the bitch, you handled those robots like a true professional. But I got news for you. I am no robot. What's the matter Phillips, guns a problem? Like I need these. There you go, no guns. What's the matter Phillips, you really just an amateur? (tense music) - Big mistake Ross. - Mistake? (hits thudding) (grunting) (keyboard clacking) (grunting) (hits thudding) (grunting) (keyboard clacking) (grunting) (dramatic music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (suspenseful music) - Don't do it! - Just an amateur. (groaning) (hits thudding) (grunting) - I said, don't do it. (hits thudding) (grunting) (computer beeping) (gun firing) (grunting) (hits thudding) (beeping) (gas hissing) (grunting) (hits thudding) (suspenseful music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (clattering) (brooding music) Are you okay? - I'm fine. - I am Unit Seven, of the Federal Division of Core Trackers. - We got a problem. - You Eric Anthony Phillips have been convicted of murder. (dramatic music) (hits thudding) (grunting) (screaming) (glass shattering) (dramatic music) (screaming) - Eric! (wooden clattering) (gun firing) (tense music) (footsteps echoing) (suspenseful music) (clicking) (whining) (explosion booming) (dramatic choir singing) - What do you say we just call it a draw? (grunting) (glass shattering) (dramatic music) (clicking) (whining) (squishing) (explosion booming) (somber music) - Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. (sirens wailing) - Got to get Dilly! - I can get to him. Come on! (brooding music) (applauding) - Thank you, thank you all for coming. After all, we are celebrating the dawn of a new age. (hits thudding) It's time, that we stopped making the mistakes our ancestors have always made. It's time we stopped being afraid of change, instead we should seek it! Stop being afraid of the future, instead we should embrace it! I tell you, the Computerized Judicial System is a road to a better tomorrow. Cybernetics is our future. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (electrical fizzing) (audience clamoring) (electrical popping) (sizzling) Cybernetics is our future, cybernetics is our future, - He's a robot! - cybernetics is our future. - He's a robot, get, get this! - Cybernetics is our future. Cybernetics is our future. Cybernetics is our future. - Eric! Get out of my way! Are you okay? - Cybernetics is our future. (electricity sizzling) (popping) Cybernetics is our future. - I think he's worse. - Cybernetics is our future. - [Woman] He's a robot! - Looks like it. - Cybernetics is our future. (relaxing music) - With the collapse of Cybercore, and the withdrawal of the Computerized Judicial System from our government, Cybercore President J. Craig Rounds has disappeared, fleeing charges of treason, conspiracy, and murder. I leave you tonight with this. Crime is at an all time high, and there are no easy answers to the violence. But we do have something crime can't take. Something worth fighting for. And that is the dignity of the individual. The value of the human soul must never be surrendered to the powers that be. In the words of novelist Ayn Rand, I respect no obligation towards men except one. to respect their freedom, and to take no part in a slave society. I'm Connie Griffith. What'd you think? - Looks like maybe you ought to run for senator. (chuckling) - So, what are you gonna do now? - Well I'm waiting to get reassigned. Guess you could say I'm a bodyguard without a body to guard. - Hmm, I seem to know someone who needs a bodyguard, but um, she'd definitely need to know that she's your only client. (relaxing music) Hey did you hear anything on Rounds yet? - No. - I don't think you will. - And why is that? - Hmm, let's just say, I gave him a taste of his own medicine. (relaxing music) (waves crashing) - I am Unit Eight, of the Federal Division of Core Trackers. (dramatic music)
