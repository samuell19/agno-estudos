( birds chirping ) ( workmen chatter ) ( hammering ) ( Italian aria playing ) HEY, FRANCESCO, WATCH OUT! CALL. KINGS AND SEVENS. AW! YOU ITALIANS PLAY CARDS LIKE YOU FIGHT. HEY! WATCH WHAT YOU SAY! ( skipping ) GO! GO FIX THAT RECORD. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? HEY! STAND CLEAR OF THE FENCE. I'M FEEDING THE ANIMAL. IT'S TIME TO CLEAR, PLEASE, CAPTAIN. ( sighs ) OOH. WHERE AM I GOING, EH? ( speaking Kikuyu ) LET'S GO. YEAH. ( ball bounces on metal ) ( pounding on metal ) FRANCESCO, YOU IDIOT! WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO, RATTLE HIS BRAINS? HE'S BEEN BEEN IN THERE FOR THREE DAYS. HIS BRAINS ARE ALREADY FRIED, OR HE WOULDN'T KEEP TRYING TO ESCAPE. AND TO THINK THEY NAMED YOU AFTER A SAINT. AH, THE BALL IS FLAT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KICK TO STRAIGHT. EH! YOU NEED SOMETHING? YES. FOOD, WATER? ARE YOU SICK? CHANGE THE RECORD. WHY DOES HE KEEP ON TRYING TO ESCAPE? THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO. ANY HE PAYS SUCH A PRICE. HE'S WILLING TO PAY IT. OH, HE JUST MAKES WORK FOR ALL OF US. TELL HIM TO GIVE UP LIKE THE REST OF THEM. IT'S FOR THE BEST FOR EVERYBODY. HOW CLOSE IS HE THIS TIME? HE'S AT THE KEYHOLE, I THINK. HE WILL MAKE IT. THE WEATHER IS CHANGING. WHEN THE BRITISH DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING, THEY STICK TO IT. THEY'RE LIKE THE GERMANS. THEY NEVER GIVE UP. MT. KENYA CANNOT BE CLIMBED ALONE. MAJOR FARRELL WILL CLIMB IT. A MAN WHO CLIMBS ALONE CLIMBS FOR THE WRONG REASONS. A MAN WHO CLIMBS ALONE CLIMBS FOR THE WRONG REASONS. ( thunder rumbling ) ( echoes ) BASTARD! BLOODY HELL, HERE COMES THE RAIN. NO PUDDING FOR YOU TONIGHT, OLD SON. WE WERE NOT EXPECTING THE COLONEL. I DARE SAY. IS FARRELL UP THAT BLOODY MOUNTAIN AGAIN? THE WEATHER'S CHANGING, SIR. THE MAJOR IS PROBABLY ON HIS WAY DOWN. WELL, HE'D BETTER HURRY UP, 'CAUSE HE'S GOT PLENTY OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON. LIEUTENANT, BRING THOSE FILES. HEY, HERE COMES FRANCO OUT HERE. IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY LET HIM OUT. SAVE YOUR SYMPATHY. HE PREFERS IT IN THERE. WHAT'S HE TRYING TO PROVE, EH, THAT HE'S BETTER THAN THE REST OF US? ( laughter ) HERE, LET ME HELP YOU. CANNOT EVEN HELP YOURSELF. LEAVE HIM ALONE. FRANCO! YOUR FRIEND CAN'T EVEN STAND ON HIS OWN TWO FEET. ( laughing ) (German accent) YOU ITALIANS SHOULD STICK TO YOUR OPERAS AND LEAVE THE FIGHTING TO US. ( Germans laugh ) WHY ARE YOU GERMANS ALWAYS SUCH SHITS? BECAUSE YOUR PRICKS ARE SO SMALL? ( laughter ) YOU WANT TO SEE IT? EH, WITH WHAT? I DON'T HAVE A MAGNIFYING GLASS. DINGO, CATCH IF YOU PLEASE! HEY! ( shouting ) ( yelling ) ( shouting ) ( yelling ) ( engine stalling ) GIVE IT SOME MORE CHOKE! ( honking ) ( honking ) GET OUT OF THE ROAD! HEY! OOF! YOU ALL RIGHT? YES. YOU BETTER SIT DOWN. I CAN'T. I'M ESCAPING. AFRAID NOT, OLD MAN. I JUST WANT TO GO HOME. EASY, SON. WHERE'S HOME? ITALY. DOES IT REALLY MATTER SO MUCH TO US, FATHER, IF WE LET HIM GO? SORRY, MY DEAR, BUT THERE'S STILL A WAR ON. WE MUST ALL DO OUR BIT. YOUR FATHER SEEMS A NICE MAN. HE IS. WOULD HE REALLY SHOOT ME? HE MIGHT. UNLESS YOU CAN FIX HIS TRUCK. TRY IT. ( engine sputters, starts ) CAN I GO NOW? ( thunder rumbling ) HARD LUCK, SIR. IS THAT WHAT IT WAS, SERGEANT? THANK YOU. YOU'LL MAKE IT NEXT TIME, SIR. EVER CLIMBED ANYTHING, HAVE YOU, SERGEANT, ANYTHING HIGHER THAN THE BACK BLOODY FENCE? NO, SIR. STILL, GOOD TO HAVE YOUR OPINION, THOUGH. STILL, GOOD TO HAVE YOUR OPINION, THOUGH. EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL, SERGEANT? AND THE PRISONER? DOING FINE. BE RIGHT WITH YOU. THANK YOU. HEY, HOUDINI! I THOUGHT YOU WERE ESCAPING. I HAD AN ACCIDENT. OH, I HOPE YOU WEREN'T HURT. DID YOU MISS ME? HEY, THE ONLY WAY I THOUGHT THEY'D BRING YOU BACK WAS IF YOU WERE DEAD. YOU SOUND DISAPPOINTED. NEXT TIME RUN FASTER. WHAT DID I DO TO THEM? THEY'VE SEEN ENOUGH FAILURE. EVERY TIME THE BRITISH BEAT YOU, IT MAKES IT WORSE. WHAT DO THEY EXPECT, FOR ME TO CURL UP AND QUIT? AT LEAST I GIVE THE BRITISH A FIGHT! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, TO HELL WITH YOU. TO HELL WITH YOU! SLOWLY, SLOWLY! THE BEARINGS ARE GOING AGAIN! HOW CLOSE DID HE COME THIS TIME? CLOSE. CLOSEST YET. YOU KNOW HIM BETTER THAN ANYONE. HAS HE ALWAYS BEEN SO STUBBORN? I ONLY KNOW HIM AS MUCH AS HE'LL LET ME, IF YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN. I DO SEE, YES. THE MAJOR'S ALWAYS CARRIED A GRUDGE, LIKE. IT'S BEEN WORSE SINCE HIS LOSS. I THINK PERSONALLY IT WAS THE FINAL STRAW. A PRISONER OF WAR CAMP IS NOT AN ASSIGNMENT FOR THE AMBITIOUS. ONE CAN SEE THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND, MR. STEWART, NOBODY'S TRYING TO SHOOT THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD OFF, EITHER. YEAH. I WISH HARRY HAD BEEN LUCKIER. WE ALL DO. WAR IS A NASTY BUSINESS. PUT ME DOWN! OH, WHAT A GREAT BIG BOY! GO AND FIND OUT IF TEA IS READY, DARLING. YOUNG GEOFFREY SEEMS TO BE HANDLING THINGS PRETTY WELL. YES, AS MUCH AS A CHILD CAN HANDLE THE DEATH OF A FATHER, I SUPPOSE. YES. HOW ARE YOU HANDLING THINGS, DAVID? NOT BAD. STILL TRYING TO GET ANDREWS TO TRANSFER ME OUT OF HERE. DAVID, HAVEN'T YOU SEEN ENOUGH FIGHTING? SURELY YOU'D BE BETTER OFF HERE AWAY FROM IT ALL. I'M A SOLDIER, PATRICIA, NOT A BLOODY NURSEMAID. WE MET ONE OF YOUR PRISONERS TODAY. HOW DO YOU MEAN, "MET ONE OF THEM?" HE WAS ESCAPING. WHAT? DON'T WORRY, FATHER STOPPED HIM. OH, BLOODY HELL. HIS NAME WAS FRANCO. DO YOU KNOW HIM? FRANCO DISTASSI. I KNOW HIM, ALL RIGHT. WELL, HE SEEMED QUITE FAMISHED. I DO HOPE YOU PROVIDE ENOUGH FOOD, DAVID. I PROVIDE, BUT I'M OBLIGED TO PROVIDE. JUST BECAUSE THESE MEN ARE PRISONERS, PATRICIA, DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS. WELL, HE DIDN'T SEEM DANGEROUS TO ME. I THINK I KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE THAN YOU DO. I SEE. I'M SORRY? TEA'S READY, MOMMY. THANK YOU, GEOFFREY. YOU'LL STAY, DAVID? WELL, I'D LIKE TO, BUT APPARENTLY I HAVE A PRISONER TO DISCIPLINE. GOOD AFTERNOON, PATRICIA. IT'S A WONDERFUL SIGHT, YOU KNOW? LIKE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. I USED TO THINK SO. NOW IT'S JUST AN OBSTACLE BETWEEN ME AND SOMALILAND AND FREEDOM. FARRELL TURNED BACK AGAIN. SO, WHAT ELSE IS NEW? HE'LL NEVER CLIMB IT. THAT'S WHAT I KEEP SAYING. BUT WHO KNOWS? HE MIGHT. NO, HE WON'T. NEVER. SO, HOW MANY MOUNTAINS HAVE YOU CLIMBED, HUH? A FEW. OH, YEAH? LIKE WHAT? THE EIGER? MAYBE. THAT'S A TOUGH ONE, EH? NOT SO TOUGH. YOU DID IT? YOU WENT UP THE SOUTH FACE? THE HARD SIDE? ALDO, THE NORTH FACE IS THE DIFFICULT CLIMB. HEY, LOOK WHO'S BACK! HEY, MAJOR, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE SOME OF US WITH YOU NEXT TIME! AWAY FROM THE FENCE! AWAY FROM THE FENCE! GET BACK! GET BACK, I SAID! FARRELL, LOOK AT THIS. I JUST GOT THE BLOODY THING UP FROM NAIROBI LAST WEEK. I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AFTER YOUR PRISONERS INSTEAD OF CLIMBING THE BLOODY MOUNTAIN. ( prisoners whooping ) WHAT'S THE MATTER, TOO HIGH FOR YOU, MAJOR? SAY IT AGAIN: OUR HERO! SERGEANT THOMAS. SIR! IS THIS RABBLE THE MIGHTY ITALIAN ARMY THAT USED TANKS AND PLANES TO BOMB ETHIOPIANS WHO WERE ARMED ONLY WITH SPEARS? ( booing ) WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE SAME MAGNIFICENT LOT THAT HAD TO BE RESCUED BY THEIR GERMAN FRIENDS AT EL ALEMAIN AND ALEXANDRIA? THE SAME, SIR. GOOD GOD! I'M ALMOST TREMBLING IN MY BOOTS. WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT, WOULD WE, SERGEANT? OH, NO, SIR. THEN YOU'D BETTER GET THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT. YOU STILL DIDN'T CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN. THAT'S RIGHT! CONFINED TO BARRACKS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. HEY! ( whistle blowing ) ( knocking ) COME IN. SIR, I'M PUTTING THIS MAN ON REPORT FOR ATTEMPTED ESCAPE. THANK YOU, SERGEANT. WOULD YOU MIND STEPPING OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE? SIR. DON'T YOU THINK THIS ROUTINE IS GETTING RATHER BORING? NO MORE BORING THAT WATCHING YOU GO UP AND DOWN THE MOUNTAIN WITHOUT EVER REACHING THE TOP. BE CAREFUL, DISTASSI, BE VERY CAREFUL. BE CAREFUL, DISTASSI, BE VERY CAREFUL. NOW, LOOK HERE, MAN. NONE OF US WANTS TO BE HERE, BUT WE'RE STUCK, AND THAT'S IT. WE SIMPLY HAVE TO PLAY BY THE RULES. WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET ME GO? THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING EACH OTHER OF OUR FAILURES EVERY DAY. YOU INSOLENT FOOL. IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DECENT TO YOU. SERGEANT MATHEW! SIR! PUT THIS MAN IN SOLITARY 24 HOURS. YES, SIR. PRISONER, ATTENTION. ABOUT TURN. QUICK MARCH. YOU'RE NOT A TRUE CLIMBER, MAJOR. YOU KEEP GOING ABOUT IT THE WRONG WAY. YOU KEEP GOING ABOUT IT THE WRONG WAY. ( radio tuning static ) WE ARE SOLDIERS. FARRELL TREATS US LIKE CRIMINALS. IT'S AGAINST THE GENEVA CONVENTION. IS IT? HE CAN'T TREAT US LIKE THAT, ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF THOSE GERMAN SWINE. HOW I HATE THEM LAUGHING AT US! Radio: AND ACCORDING TO LATEST DISPATCHES FROM THE DESERT FRONT, THE BRITISH EIGHTH ARMY UNDER ITS NEW COMMANDER IN CHIEF, GENERAL MONTGOMERY, INFLICTED A SEVERE DEFEAT ON A LARGELY ITALIAN FORCE AT EL WADI, NORTHEAST OF CAIRO, ROUTING THE ITALIANS AND CAPTURING... TURN IT OFF! OFF! AND DON'T PUT IT ON AGAIN UNTIL WE GET SOME GOOD NEWS. BUT IT IS GOOD NEWS. WE ARE LOSING THE WAR! WE CAN GO HOME SOON. ( laughing ) YES, BUT WE'RE LOSING SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT -- OUR HONOR. IN THE MEANTIME ON THE RUSSIAN FRONT, THE GERMAN FORCES HAVE ADVANCED WITHIN 100 MILES OF STALINGRAD. THE GERMAN FORCES HAVE ADVANCED WITHIN 100 MILES OF STALINGRAD. ( mixed-voice choir vocalizing ) ( mixed-voice choir vocalizing ) ( knocking ) COME IN. BEGGING YOUR PARDON, SIR. JUST WONDERED IF YOU'D HEARD THE GOOD NEWS ON THE WIRELESS. I DID, SERGEANT, YES. THEY SAY WITH OLD MONTY IN CHARGE, JERRY WILL SOON TURN TAIL. THERE'S A BIG BATTLE COMING UP, SIR. MAYBE WE'LL GET CALLED UP. I'LL GET THOSE EYE-TIES TO TURN THE MUSIC OFF, SIR. IT'S PAST LIGHTS OUT. NO, SERGEANT. LET THEM LISTEN, IF THEY LIKE. YES, SIR. GOOD NIGHT, SERGEANT. ( door closes ) THE GERMANS HAVE THEIR WAR. THE BRITISH HAVE THEIR EMPIRE. BUT THIS... THIS IS OUR HONOR. YOU SELFISH BASTARD! HEY! WHOA! STOP! STOP! STOP! YOU ARE MEN, NOT ANIMALS! IT'S MINE! HE STOLE IT FROM ME. WHERE'S YOUR PRIDE? GIVE IT TO ME! IT'S MINE! I NEED THIS. WHY? IT'S JUST A PICTURE. THE PIG ATE ALL THE MEAT. TO YOU IT'S A PICTURE. TO ME IT'S A MAP. YOU SEE, THIS IS THE MOUNTAIN FROM A DIFFERENT SIDE. YOU SEE THIS GLACIER? THAT'S THE WAY TO THE TOP, THAT'S THE SECRET. SO GIVE IT TO YOUR FRIEND FARRELL. OH, NO, NO. THIS IS NOT FOR FARRELL. THIS IS FOR US. WE ARE GOING TO CLIMB MT. KENYA! YOU MEAN ESCAPE? NO, NO, NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT ESCAPE. I'M TALKING ABOUT CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN AND THEN COMING BACK INTO CAMP. ARE YOU CRAZY, ALDO? WHY COME BACK? LOOK, ONLY A FEW OF US COULD ESCAPE, HUH? SO WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT DO FOR THE REST OF US? I'M TALKING ABOUT BEATING THE BRITISH AND FARRELL AT THEIR OWN GAME! FARRELL, HE'S NEVER GOTTEN TO THE TOP, HUH? THEN WE DO, WE PLACE THE ITALIAN FLAG ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN, AND THEN WE ESCAPE BACK INTO THE CAMP AND ( whistles ). ( laughs ) THAT'S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF GESTURE THE BRITISH WOULD UNDERSTAND. IT WOULD HUMILIATE THEM. AND THAT BASTARD FARRELL. AYE, IT WOULD WIN BACK OUR HONOR. SI, BUT WHO WOULD GO? WE NEED THREE MEN TO CLIMB FOR ALL OF US -- A KNOWLEDGEABLE MOUNTAIN LEADER, RELIABLE SUPPORT CLIMBER, THEN A TOP-NOTCH CLIMBER TO MAKE IT TO THE SUMMIT. YOU COULD BE THE LEADER, ALDO; ONE OF US COULD BE THE SUPPORT, BUT WHO WOULD MAKE IT TO THE SUMMIT? WE NEED SOMEONE OF GREAT COURAGE AND ABILITY. GUIDO WILL STAY AT BASE CAMP. YOU AND I WILL MAKE THE ASCENT. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. NOW, IF ALL GOES WELL, WE SHOULD BE UP THERE AND BACK IN FIVE DAYS. WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE MEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO COVER FOR US FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME. NO, I MEAN ABOUT COMING BACK. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. THE MEN WILL KNOW WHAT WE DID, WHAT WE ACHIEVED. IT WILL GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF. ( chuckles ) IF I EVER GET TO THE TOP OF THAT MOUNTAIN, I'M GOING DOWN THE OTHER SIDE INTO SOMALILAND AND ALL THE WAY BACK TO ITALY. THEN YOU WON'T GO. ( banging ) FRANCO, LISTEN TO ME. I SAID I WON'T COME BACK! THEN I WILL MAKE THE ASCENT MYSELF. YOU CAN'T. YOU'RE TOO OLD. LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BUG! I WAS CLIMBING MOUNTAINS BEFORE YOU WERE BORN! AND I CAN STILL CLIMB. I WILL MAKE IT! ( sighs ) WITHOUT ME, YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT. FRANCO, IT'S NOT JUST YOU. WE'RE ALL TRYING TO SURVIVE. JUST FOR ONCE, THINK OF SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOURSELF FOR A CHANGE. ALDO. ALDO! YOU NEED ME, ALDO. YOU NEED ME! FRANCO? WHY GIVE THAT BASTARD THE CHANCE? HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE REST OF US. THE MINUTE THEY DISCOVER YOU MISSING, THE REST OF US WILL BE CONFINED TO BARRACKS FOREVER. I WOULD TAKE THAT RISK FOR YOU, ALDO, BUT NOT FOR A MAN WHO LOOKS ONLY AFTER HIMSELF. HE'S AN EXPERIENCED CLIMBER. ARE ANY OF THE REST OF YOU? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN AT 17,000 FEET? DO YOU KNOW HOW TO RAPPEL, TO CHOOSE A TRAVERSE, EVEN HOW TO COIL A ROPE PROPERLY? IT'S GOT TO BE DISTASSI. HE'S ALWAYS GONE HIS OWN WAY. HE'S NEVER TAKEN ANY OF US WHEN HE'S TRIED TO ESCAPE. THAT'S TRUE. FOR THIS TO WORK, WE ALL MUST BE A FAMILY. DISTASSI, HE'S JUST ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY. WE ALL SHARE IN THE GLORY. WE NEED HIM TO GET TO THE TOP! HOW DO WE KNOW WHEN HE GETS TO THE TOP HE JUST DOES NOT KEEP GOING? SI. LEAVE THAT TO ME. ARE WE ALL AGREED? SI. OKAY. TRYING TO SNEAK UP ON IT IN THE DARK? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT CLIMBING, DISTASSI? WHY DO YOU WANT TO CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN, MAJOR? YOU DON'T RESPECT IT. YOU HAVE TO CARESS THE ROCK. THEN IT WILL REVEAL ITS SECRETS TO YOU. ( chuckles ) CARESS THE BLOODY THING! ( laughs ) IS THAT HOW YOU ITALIANS DO IT? LOAD OF BLOODY NONSENSE. I BET THE ONLY CLIMBING YOU'VE DONE IS UP THE BACK STAIRS OF A BLOODY BROTHEL. AT LEAST I GOT TO THE TOP. Aldo: TODAY WE START OUR PREPARATIONS, BUT WE WILL NEED HELP FROM ALL THE ARTISANS AND TRADESMEN IN OUR CAMP. EH, SI. WE'LL NEED BOOTS AND TOOLS AND CLOTHING AND TANKS AND -- BUT FIRST, WE MUST LEARN TO SING. SING? WHAT FOR? WE'LL BE MAKING A LOT OF THINGS, RIGHT? AND A LOT OF NOISE, A LOT OF BANGING AND HAMMERING AND FILING AND SO... WE NEED A LOT OF ♪ MMMAH ( laughing ) SINGING TO COVER IT UP. WHAT ABOUT DISTASSI? WILL HE DO IT? YES, YES. HE'S IN FULL ACCORD. GOOD. I THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE. THE FIRST THING WE MUST MAKE ARE CRAMPONS. GOOD. WHAT ARE CRAMPONS? HMM. ♪ MI MI MI MI MI ( singing in Italian ) ♪ MI MI MI MI MI ( singing in Italian ) STOP, STOP! STOP IT, YOU ARE TOO FLAT! ONE MORE TIME. SHH. GUIDO. GUIDO! SING! YOU ARE FLAT! GUIDO. GUIDO, GUIDO. WHO CARES IF IT'S IN TUNE? JUST BE LOUD, HMM? LOUD. ( singing ) FRANCO. FRANCO. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M ALIVE. FRANCO, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. WE WANT TO THANK YOU. YES, AND ALDO TOLD US YOU WERE GONNA CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN FOR US, ALL OF US, AND BRING US BACK OUR HONOR. WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP AND THEN RETURN, THAT WILL RUB THEIR NOSES IN IT. WE HAVE MISJUDGED YOU. WE ARE SORRY. MAKE IT VERY SHARP, HUH? OKAY. SO IT STICKS INTO THE ICE. AH, SI. MAKE IT TIGHT, HUH? ( rhythmic clangs ) I HAVE A SURPRISE, SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, HUH? HEY! FRANCO. WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO GO. GUIDO AND I WERE HOPING YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND. ( chuckles ) WHY? I LIKE IT IN HERE. ( sighs ) I THINK YOU'RE GOING CRAZY IN THERE. AM I? OUT THERE YOU CAN NEVER BE ALONE. I MAY DIE IN HERE, BUT OUT THERE, I WILL GO CRAZY. YOU OPEN A LETTER, EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW WHAT'S IN IT. YOU WHISTLE A TUNE, SOMEBODY JOINS IN. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, HUH? THAT'S LIFE! ANYWAY, I DON'T REMEMBER YOU EVER GETTING A LETTER. I JUST LIKE BEING ALONE, THAT'S ALL. YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR LIFE THAT WAY, FRANCO. I'VE DONE ALL RIGHT SO FAR. HAVE YOU? FRANCO, LISTEN TO ME. I NEED YOU. WE ALL NEED YOU. COME WITH US. ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL COME BACK? YOU MUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL COME BACK. OKAY. ( laughs ) PLANNING AN ESCAPE? YOUR PLAY. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH THE JUNGLE. YOU WILL BE LOST IN ONE HOUR WITHOUT THIS. HOW MUCH? ONE PRICE ONLY. I COME WITH YOU. WE NEED A CLIMBER. I'M A BAVARIAN. I WAS BORN IN THE MOUNTAINS. OUT OF THE QUESTION YOUR PLAY, YOUR PLAY. THEN IT'S MY DUTY TO TELL SGT. THOMAS. SON OF A BITCH! HALT! ( whistle blowing ) BREAK IT UP! ASKARI! ( wolf whistle ) I'M WITH YOU, SWEETHEART! GET AWAY FROM THE FENCE! GET BACK! SHE DOESN'T NEED AN ENGLISHMAN; SHE NEEDS AN ITALIAN! THE SAW'S BROKEN DOWN, DAVID. I NEED TO BORROW YOUR PRISONER, FRANCO. I'LL HAVE HIM BACK BY THIS AFTERNOON. THAT'S A PROMISE. I AM SORRY, PATRICIA, THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. THE MAN'S A PRISONER OF WAR! HE'S TRIED TO ESCAPE FIVE BLOODY TIMES! I UNDERSTAND THAT, DAVID, BUT WHO ELSE CAN DO IT? THE MACHINERY'S ITALIAN. THE MANUALS ARE ALL IN ITALIAN. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? ( sighs ) I AM SORRY. I REALLY DON'T THINK I CAN ALLOW IT. DAVID, UNLESS THE SAW IS FIXED, FATHER CANNOT GIVE YOU THE LUMBER NEEDED TO FINISH THE NEW BARRACKS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CHOICE. HEY, FRANCO, WHAT MAKES YOU SO LUCKY? HEY, FRANCO, WHAT MAKES YOU SO LUCKY? THAT MUST FEEL GOOD. I HAVEN'T SHAVED IN A LONG TIME. NOW, HOW AM I GONNA EXPLAIN THIS TO THE MAJOR? NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING CLEAN, SERGEANT. THE MAN IS NOT AN ANIMAL. ACTUALLY, I RATHER ENJOYED TALKING WITH HIM BEFORE, AND SO DID PATRICIA. DID SHE? IT'S A LONELY LIFE FOR A WIDOW, WITH ALL THE ABLE-BODIED MEN OFF TO WAR. SHE DOESN'T GET NEARLY ENOUGH CONVERSATION. I WOULDN'T MIND A BIT OF CONVERSATION MYSELF, NOW AND THEN. ALL RIGHT. OOF! AH! NO, DON'T DO THAT. IT MAKES YOU LOOK... WHAT? SOMEONE I USED TO KNOW. ( sniffles ) SOMEONE NICE, I HOPE. VERY NICE. MY HUSBAND. ( chuckles ) THEY WANTED ME TO FIGHT. I'M NOT A SOLDIER. I'M AN ENGINEER. THEY GIVE ME A RIFLE. THEY SAY, "HIT THIS TARGET." I HIT A PIG. I HIT A COW -- I HIT TWO COWS, AND A BICYCLE. AND ALDO TOLD ME THEY GAVE YOU A CROSS FOR BRAVERY. I GOT LUCKY. BETTER MEN DID NOT. I GOT A MEDAL, THEY GOT GRAVES. YOU KNOW, THIS MACHINE WAS MADE IN ITALY, SERGEANT. MAYBE IT'S SABOTAGING YOUR WAR EFFORT. ( speaking Kikuyu ) ( replies in Kikuyu ) FATHER IS INVITING YOU TO JOIN HIM FOR TEA, SERGEANT, OR PERHAPS SOMETHING A LITTLE STRONGER? UNCOMMONLY HOSPITABLE MAN, YOUR FATHER. EXCUSE ME, MISS. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? ABOUT HOME. WHAT DO YOU MISS MOST? MOSTLY THE, UH... SOFTNESS. SOFTNESS. YES. OF THE AIR, THE LIGHT, THE PEOPLE. AND THE WOMEN? HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO ITALY? ONCE. WITH MY HUSBAND. TO ROME. DO YOU REMEMBER IT? I REMEMBER THE MEN. THEY USED TO WATCH ME WHEREVER I WENT. THEY WOULD TOUCH ME IN CROWDS. MY HUSBAND GOT VERY UPSET. HE SAID THE ITALIANS WERE A PEOPLE WITHOUT RESTRAINT. I THINK HE WAS WRONG. YOU SEEM TO BE RESTRAINING YOURSELF VERY WELL. YOU SEEM TO BE RESTRAINING YOURSELF VERY WELL. DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN, SERGEANT? NO, SIR. NO, I DON'T. YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK A MAN CAN EVER UNDERSTAND WOMEN UNLESS HE RAISES A DAUGHTER. ( laughs ) EVEN THEN, I'M NOT SO SURE, SIR. WELL? IT'S FIXED. HE FIXED IT WITH ONE OF THESE, SIR. IT'S BRASS, NOT STEEL, AND SURE TO BREAK AGAIN, AND SOON. I SEE. DID YOU INFORM MR. STEWART? NO, SIR, BUT... BUT WHAT? WELL... WELL, COME ON, THOMAS. OUT WITH IT. I THINK MRS. HUNT ALREADY KNOWS, SIR. I THINK MRS. HUNT ALREADY KNOWS, SIR. DID YOU? DID YOU? FRANCO, WHAT DID HE WANT? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? GUIDO, TELL ALDO IT'S TIME. YES, WE'RE GOING TOMORROW. NO, TONIGHT, GUIDO. TELL ALDO TONIGHT. OKAY. DAVID? BLOODY COW. I RESPECTED YOU, GODDAMN IT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BARGING IN HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT? YOU REEK OF ALCOHOL. OH, REALLY? YOU DIDN'T CARE HOW YOUR ITALIAN FRIEND SMELLED, DID YOU? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? DID YOU SLEEP WITH HIM? YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK ME A QUESTION LIKE THAT, DAVID. DAVID, WHAT ON EARTH--! IT'S OKAY, FATHER. IT'S ALL RIGHT. I ALWAYS TREATED YOU WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT! ( chuckles ) GOOD GOD, WOMAN, I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU TO MARRY ME! ( sighs ) OH, DAVID. YOU'RE STILL AT WAR. WELL, OF COURSE I AM. IT'S STILL BLOODY GOING ON! I MEAN IN YOUR HEART. WHAT THE BLOODY HELL DOES THAT MEAN? ( sighs ) WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT IN THE MORNING. COME ON, LET'S FIND YOU A BED. COME ON, DAVID. NOW! WATCH THE NOISE, GUIDO. CAREFUL! EASY. FRANCO, WAKE UP. IT'S OKAY. WAIT. WAIT. NOW! HAVE TO GET YOUR SIZE. I MADE EXTRA POCKETS SO YOU COULD HOLD EVERYTHING. IS GOOD? HEY. WHAT ABOUT MY THINGS? WHAT IS HE DOING HERE? HE'S TAKING GUIDO'S PLACE. WHY? HE HAS A COMPASS. WE WANT IT, WE TAKE HIM. THAT'S THE DEAL. FORGET THE COMPASS. EITHER WE TAKE HIM, OR HE TELLS FARRELL OF OUR PLAN. YOU BASTARD. HUH? WE HAVE NO CHOICE. COME. WE MUST HURRY. SHOW HIM THE TELESCOPE. DON'T WORRY, I WON'T BE IN YOUR WAY. IT'S NOT VERY STRONG. IT'S THE BEST I CAN DO. I HOPE IT CAN HELP. WE MADE IT WITH HIS SPARE GLASSES. HERE, TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE ROCK FALLS. PERFECT. YOUR NEW BALL? DON'T WORRY, YOU CAN BUY ME ANOTHER ONE WHEN ITALY WINS THE WORLD CUP AFTER THE WAR. YEAH! MUCH BETTER. ( laughs ) COME, WE MUST HURRY. COME. COME ON, KIRST, KIRST! COME ON. HERE. FRANCO! GOOD LUCK. ( singing in Italian ) ( shouts ) ( singing in Italian ) ( shouts ) KIMBO, MATHEWS, STOP THAT BLOODY RACKET! KIMBO, MATHEWS, STOP THAT BLOODY RACKET! ENOUGH! HEY, STOP IT! GET BACK TO BED! LIGHT OUT! ( tapping billy club ) GET BACK TO BED! PULL IT TIGHT. PATRICIA, I'M... I'M DEEPLY SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT. I KNOW, DAVID, BUT WAR MAKES PEOPLE DO FUNNY THINGS, ACT IN STRANGE WAYS. YOU SEEM SO DETERMINED TO HAVE US JUST SLOT TOGETHER LIKE A REPLACEMENT PART. LIVES CAN'T BE PUT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN SO EASILY. I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE YOU AND YOUNG GEOFFREY ON, YOU KNOW. I LOST MY FAMILY, YOU LOST YOUR HUSBAND. SEEMED TO MAKE SUCH GOOD SENSE. GEOFFREY AND I DON'T WANT TO BE "TAKEN ON." WE WANT SOMEONE WHO LOVES US. WELL. I LOVE YOU. ( chuckles ) DO YOU, DAVID? I KNOW YOU NEED ME, BUT DO YOU LOVE ME? I THOUGHT WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING. YOU MAY HAVE DONE, BUT THIS SI THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE LET ME KNOW YOU CARED ABOUT ME. I-I'D BEST BE GOING. MAY I COME BACK? I HOPE YOU WILL. THANK YOU. THERE IS YOUR MOUNTAIN. YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M LEAVING. YOU WHAT? I AM LEAVING. THERE IS AN AGRICULTURAL DEPOT 20 KILOMETERS THAT WAY. IF I CAN STEAL A VEHICLE THERE, I'M IN TANGANYIKA IN FOUR HOURS. WHAT ABOUT OUR PLAN? WE NEED YOU AT BASE CAMP! THAT'S YOUR PLAN, NOT MINE. IF YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS, YOU COME WITH ME. YOU NAZI BASTARD! WE'RE CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN AND RETURNING! YOU'RE CRAZY, AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL THINK YOU'RE CRAZY, TOO. THEY'D ESCAPE IF THEY COULD. WE'RE DOING IT FOR THEM! WELL, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT FOR ME. FRANCO, LEAVE ALDO ALONE WITH HIS CRAZY SCHEME. COME WITH ME. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR LIFE BACK. NO MORE WIRE, NO MORE SOLITARY. REAL FOOD? WOMEN? COME! ACH! FRANCO. FORGET IT. LET'S GO. FETCH DISTASSI. SIR. ( chuckles ) BUON GIORNO. SERGEANT THOMAS! MESSNER! JA WOHL! BOMBOLT? JA WOHL! SCHUMACHER! JA WOHL! THERE'S, UH, THREE OF THEM MISSING, SIR, PINELLI, KIRST, AND DISTASSI. I SEE. WELL, THEY WON'T GET FAR ON FOOT, SERGEANT. SEND KIMBO TO NANYUKI. YOU AND I WILL GO TO THE AGRICULTURAL DEPOT. THEY MIGHT TRY TO PINCH A VEHICLE. AND BRING YOUR RIFLE. SIR. Aldo: WE'RE ALMOST OUT OF THE JUNGLE. TOMORROW, WE SHOULD REACH THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN. ( gunshot ) ( speaking native language ) ( speaking native language ) WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM? I SAID, "I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH." ( laughs ) I THINK YOU'LL FIND NONE OF THEM START, OLD SON. SCHEISS. WELL DONE, KIRST. YOU LASTED LONGER THAN YOUR TWO ITALIAN FRIENDS. I KNEW THEY'D NEVER MAKE IT TO THAT STUPID MOUNTAIN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THE MOUNTAIN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THE MOUNTAIN? WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. SOON, WHEN WE GET TO THE TOP OF THAT GORGE. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN! AH... WOULD YOU SMELL IT, FRANCO! WHAT? FREEDOM! ( laughs ) IT'S ALL AROUND US! ( echoes ) OH, FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM! ( laughs ) FREEDOM! THEY COULDN'T HAVE GOT FURTHER THAN THE TYNDAL GLACIER. DON'T YOU WORRY, SERGEANT. WE'LL GET THEM. WE'LL BLOODY WELL GET THEM. YES, SIR, I BELIEVE YOU WILL. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALDO AND FRANCO? SPLIT UP. THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN. YOU MEAN YOU RAN OUT ON THEM? YEAH, WHAT OF IT? DON'T YOU THINK THEY WON'T RUN OUT ON YOU ONCE THEY MAKE IT TO THE TOP? YOU THINK THEY'LL COME BACK TO THIS? WOULD YOU? SON OF A BITCH! THAT'S ENOUGH. ( both speaking Kikuyu ) THEY PASSED HIM THIS MORNING. I KNOW A SHORTCUT. THERE IT IS! WHAT A BEAUTY. MAGNIFICENT. LOOK AT THOSE GLACIERS! LOOK AT THE WAY SHE JUST STANDS THERE ALONE WITH NO OTHER PEAKS TO CHALLENGE HER, HUH? THOSE GLACIERS WILL LEAD US TO THE SUMMIT. SEE, UP THE FIRST GLACIER, THEN TO THE UPPER ONE AND THEN ACROSS THIS RIDGE HERE AND UP TO THE GAP, AND THEN TO THE TOP. ALDO. ALDO, WHEN WE REACH THE TOP, WE WILL HAVE DONE WHAT WE TOLD THE OTHERS WE WOULD DO. YES. YOU CAN GO BACK TO CAMP IF YOU WANT TO, BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP GOING ALL THE WAY DOWN THE OTHER SIDE INTO SOMALILAND. WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME? YOU PROMISED THEM THAT YOU WOULD RETURN! YOU PROMISED ME! THERE IS A WAR, ALDO. NO ONE CAN KEEP PROMISES IN A WAR. YOU AND I ARE NOT AT WAR! YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD. I LIED! I HAD TO GET OUT OF THAT STINKING HUT. I HAD TO GET AWAY FROM FARRELL. I WON'T GO BACK! I CAN'T. NOW, LISTEN TO ME. IF YOU SUCCEED IN ESCAPING, TO THE BRITISH YOU'RE JUST A MAN WHO RAN AWAY, BUT IF YOU CONQUER THE MOUNTAIN AND RETURN, THEN IT'S LIKE SPITTING IN THEIR FACE. YOU SHOW THEM AND YOU SHOW US THAT CAPTIVITY CANNOT BREAK THE SPIRIT OF A HUMAN BEING. THEY NEVER BROKE MY SPIRIT. OH, WELL, YES, BUT WHAT ABOUT US? EVERY BIT OF CLOTHING, EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, EVERY MORSEL OF FOOD IN YOUR MOUTH IS THE RESULT OF THOSE MEN SACRIFICING FOR YOU TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING FOR THEM, NOT YOURSELF! I DIDN'T ASK THEM FOR ANYTHING. YOU TOOK IT, THOUGH, DIDN'T YOU! THEN I'LL GIVE IT BACK, AND I'LL WALK DOWN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN NAKED IF I HAVE TO. FRANCO, NO MAN CAN LIVE ALONE. I'VE BEEN ALONE MY WHOLE GODDAMN LIFE. WHAT A PITY. WHEN YOU REACH THE SUMMIT, FRANCO, YOU MAKE THINK YOU STAND THERE ALL ALONE, BUT YOU WON'T BE. ALL THOSE MEN BACK THERE WILL BE STANDING BESIDE YOU. REMEMBER THAT BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY AND LEAVE THEM. ( coughing ) DON'T WASTE YOUR BREATH, ALDO. YOU'RE NOT USED TO THE ALTITUDE YET. I'M NOT THE ONE IN TROUBLE. YOU ARE! THEN FOR MY SAKE, WE'LL GO SLOWER. THEN FOR MY SAKE, WE'LL GO SLOWER. ( Aldo coughing ) WE'LL, UH, CAMP HERE TONIGHT, START TO CLIMB IN THE MORNING. OH, NO, NO. THERE'S AT LEAST TWO MORE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT. WE HAVE TO AVOID THE GLACIER IN THE AFTERNOON. THE SUN WILL CAUSE THE ICE AND THE ROCKS TO FALL. IT'S SAFER IN THE MORNING. OKAY? OKAY. ALDO. SO SOON! HOW COULD THEY HAVE? KIRST. DO YOU SEE THEM, SIR? THERE THEY ARE, SERGEANT. ( wheezing ) FRANCO... WHERE'S THE MOUNTAIN? ALDO. ALDO. LISTEN TO -- AL -- ALDO, LISTEN TO ME! I CAN'T BREATHE. I KNOW, I KNOW. YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. YOU MUST GO -- I KNOW, I MUST GO DOWN. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY. I'LL TAKE YOU. NO. YOU LEAVE ME. THEY WILL FIND ME. THEY WILL HAVE TO CARE FOR ME. IT WILL SLOW THEM DOWN. TAKE MY THINGS. YOU MUST DO IT ALONE, BUT YOU MUST DO IT! YOU MUST DO IT ALONE, BUT YOU MUST DO IT! GOOD-BYE, MY FRIEND. I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN... BACK IN THE CAMP, FRANCO. ( hacking ) YOU COULD DIE, MAN. TAKE HIM TO THE STEWART'S RANCH. THAT'S CLOSEST. PATRICIA WILL TEND TO HIM. AND THEN STRAIGHT BACK HERE, SERGEANT, ON THE DOUBLE. YES, SIR. YOU WON'T NEED THE GUN. HE'S NOT TRYING TO ESCAPE. DOING A BLOODY GOOD IMITATION. HE JUST WANTS THE MOUNTAIN. HE CAN'T HAVE IT. COME ALONG, OLD SON. WE BETTER GET YOU DOWN. ( wind whistling ) AAH! ( grunts ) ( horn honking ) WHAT HAPPENED? THE MAJOR SAYS IT'S MOUNTAIN SICKNESS. OKAY, LET'S GET HIM WARM. ( sighs ) GETTING SLEEPY, ARE WE, DISTASSI? NO. I WON'T LET YOU TAKE HER. SHE'S MINE. SHE BELONGS TO NO ONE. I'LL WATCH HIM FOR A WHILE. YOU GET SOME SLEEP. ( grunts ) SERGEANT? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIM? THE MAJOR TELLS ME MORE PEOPLE HAVE DIED CLIMBING MOUNT KENYA THAN ANY OTHER MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD. THAT'S WITHOUT CHASING ANYBODY, MISS. HE WOULDN'T SHOOT HIM, WOULD HE? I SHOULDN'T THINK THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. ( sighs ) I THINK THEY'RE BOTH MAD. OH, YEAH. YES, MISS. YOU'RE VERY FOND OF HIM, AREN'T YOU? THE MAJOR'S NOT THE KIND OF MAN WHO LETS YOU CARE FOR HIM TOO MUCH, MISS, BUT I DO THINK HE DESERVES BETTER THAN HE'S GOT. DON'T WORRY, MAJOR. IT'S SAFE. IT'S MADE BY ITALIANS. ( fires ) DISTASSI! STOP, OR I'LL SHOOT YOU DEAD. ARE WE GOING TO LEAVE THIS MOUNTAIN UNCLIMBED, MAJOR? YOU'RE AN ESCAPING PRISONER OF WAR! I HAVE THE RIGHT. SHE'S TOO BEAUTIFUL, MAJOR. Aldo: FRANCO! FRANCO! FRANCO! IT'S ALL RIGHT. ALDO, ALDO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. DON'T YOU HAVE A PRISONER TO TAKE BACK TO CAMP, MAJOR? ( shouting ) BACK! GET BACK! GET BACK! FRANCO, DID YOU MAKE IT? JUMA, GIVE THEM THE BLOODY TELESCOPE. FRANCO. FRANCO, YOU CAME BACK. YOU LOOK BETTER. DID YOU MAKE IT? YES. YES! THERE IT IS. THE ITALIAN FLAG ON TOP OF MOUNT KENYA! ( cheering ) FRANCO! FRANCO!
