Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the black rock science and technology laboratory. The security of the world's science and technology conference remains our top priority since the conference is right around the corner. We have developed a mechanical exoskeleton, code named, power. The operator will be able to generate 2700 pounds of punching power. And easily make a 30 meters height leap when wearing the exoskeleton suit. In the face of sudden danger, power can make rapid responses and avoiding any attacks, while its high-strength synthetic fibered shell. Provides the total protection for its operator. To say that power integrates today's most cutting edged and advanced technologies, is not an exaggeration but an understatement. It is a machine that combines speed, agility, strength and endurance. Thank you. That's incredible. I am glad to announce that power is ready. It has passed all the control tests. And in three month, at the science and technology summit. It will be revealed to the entire world. Boss, we will need to ensure the loyalties of the operators. Doctor. I am a little bit worry about the operators. What if they... You don't have to worry about that. We have the most advanced vr system in the world, which can help us screen out the best operators. Well, congratulations, doctor Cohen! Ok, power's core data, has been securely stored in the central system. It's still hard for me to figure out how so much power can reside in such tiny device. Doctor. Are you all right? Power is a double-edged sword. Any mistake is not tolerated. I think we won't have any problems because we have the best doctor in the world. You have been working so hard recently, I want you to take your team for a good time. It's my treat. Well in fact, I prefer to work. Recently, Anthony the president of the kb corporation has received bullets in three consecutive mails. As kb corporation recently launched the "omega" new energy plan, which has a huge impact on the crude oil market. Insiders have revealed that as the president. Anthony might be retaliated for the company's action. Anthony said the intention of "omega" plan, is to benefit mankinds - hurry up get ready. - And will not be compromised. The round table conference of Asia pacific business, will be held today as it plans. But Anthony will be there or not? It's still unknown. God, why did they chose such a picture of me? Can't believe it. Captain! Boss, are you ready? We are ready when you are ready, captain. Let's go! Captain, I heard next week is your daughter's birthday. It is for her. Thanks, my friend. Never mind. It's nothing, it's not important. Is it working now? Thanks, captain. This will never happen again, I promise. Grenade! Boss! Are you ok? Back up! Everybody back up! Go! Keep move!

At least let me die with a hot girl! Heavy firing! Hit them down! Suppressing fire! Go! Oh shit! Are you ok? I'm still breathing. I am a bird in the forest, living on a beautiful hillside. - Watching the sunset and sunrise. - Fangfang. Why fangfang and mommy are smiling, but daddy is not? Because it has been long since daddy last smiled. If daddy smiles, can you also draw me a smiling face too? You will have to laugh like this. Ha, ha, ha. Can you laugh like this? Of course ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. Daddy! Daddy! Are you ok, daddy? Daddy is fine. What are you two doing? What's making you guys so happy? - Look mommy, daddy is smiling. - Daddy is smiling. Go sweaty. You go play over there for a moment. We will have the cake soon. Cake! Yeah! - We will have the cake soon. - Are you all right? I am fine. Gao sir just called. He said the retirement is all set and done. I am thinking, we can go visit Japan. Go see mountain fujiyama. You have been talking about it several times before. But we never went. This is a good opportunity for you to go and relax. Wang yu's funeral hasn't been held yet, I can't leave now. I am just worrying about you that you are being too hard on yourself. Let's not talk about this for now, I need some time by myself to think about it. Mommy, the cake is here. I am coming. This is your cake. Thank you. Mommy, what's wrong? Kexin! Calm down. - Mommy. - Don't come here! Kexin. Calm down. There will be a way. It is too late. Go! Kexin! - Mommy, mommy! - Kexin! - Mommy, mommy! - Kexin! - Mommy! - You guys go now hurry! Mommy, mommy! Fangfang! - Go away! - Mommy, mommy open the door! Mommy! - Fangfang go away! - Mommy! Mommy, open the door mommy! Kexin! Hot dog! Delicious! Come here! Take a look! I am back. Come let's eat. Here. You must be hungry. Here. Fangfang eat first. Today, daddy found a new school for you. I did all the research. Everybody there at this new school are extreme friendly. Daddy promises you, there will not be bullying this time. Fangfang. Hello. Doctor lin. Mr long, the results of fangfang's last test are not very optimistic. The blood clot inside her brain hasn't been completely absorbed. It could happen at any given moment. I recommend an immediate operation. Mr long, are you still there? Yes I understand. I will get the money for the operation ready as soon as possible. Thank you very much. Go! Cheers! I'm going to the bathroom. Things are getting worse this year. I had to consult a divorce lawyer that was my last resort. But the inscription fee is 400 dollars per hour way beyond my pay grade. I can't afford that. She is smoking hot. I'll be right back. Good luck. Is it fixed? Yeah. It was the circuit board, I replaced it with a new one. It is all good now. How's everything with fangfang's transfer to the new school? We got the approval from the president, but fangfang's test results are back and they are not good. I am afraid that the school thing will have to wait. Here is the money for the past couple of jobs. Thank you uncle liao. Uncle liao, this is too much! This is for fangfang. Thanks. What are you doing here? Help! Help! - Shut up! - Don't touch me. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Looking for trouble? Are you ok? - Thank you. - Get up. - Damn! - Be careful! Help me! Help me! I am not looking for any troubles. Run! Run! - Amy. - What's happened? Oh, my god. Are you hurt? - Are you ok? - I'm ok. Thanks. And then, it hits the little bear with a bang. Have some water. Thanks. By the way, how did you find it here? It was uncle liao who gave me your address. I didn't get the chance to thank you for last time. Don't mention it. Actually, I want to thank you for bring fangfang so many presents. She hasn't been this happy in a long time. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. Mr long, with your talents and skills. Why? Why do I do repair job? What else can I do? It's too late for me to start fresh. If you want to mr long, you can come working for our company. Oh. We are recruiting security personnels. I think you are perfect for the position. Thank you, but no thanks. If it was ten years ago, I would consider. Oh. Don't worry you can think about it. If you are up to it, just give me a phone call. Oh, ok. Well it's getting late. I still have work to do. Oh! Ok. I will get going. I will talk to you next time. Fangfang! Fangfang! - Fangfang! - Fangfang! - Fangfang! - Fangfang! Fangfang! Fangfang. Wake up. You are scaring daddy. Wake up. Call the ambulance now. It will take too long, there's not enough time. Is there adrenaline shots? Is there adrenaline shots? Longwei. Longwei. Longwei. Adrenaline shots. Yes. Yes. There is. Here. Hurry now! Fangfang. Fangfang. Fangfang, fangfang. Fangfang. Fangfang. Fangfang. Fangfang. She's waking up. Fangfang. Fangfang, daddy is here. Thank you. Brother tang. Brother tang. Brother tang. Can you count me in for that job at the dock tonight? How's your body holding up? Don't risk your health for the sake of making money to pay for your daughter's medical expenses. Don't worry I am all good. Hello, hello. Hello, hold on! Hello. May I talk to long feng's parents? Yes, I am. This is the central hospital. I am putting the money together to pay for the treatment. All I am asking is just a couple of more days! The record shows that the fee has already been paid earlier today. Oh. I hate you. What is that? Get up. What do you have there being so sneaky? This is for you. Did you hurt your hand for making it? Dose it hurt? It doesn't matter. It will keep you safe is what matters. When did you become so superstitious? I am telling you it works. Plus I made it myself. It will protect you. Thank you honey. You are such a caring person. I have decided, I will quit my job tonight. Tomorrow we will fly to Japan. Go see mountain fujiyama. How about that? - Really? - Yes. For you. Stop it. I just want you to do what you think is right. My only request is you come back safely. Yes. Open it see if you like it. See, the three beads represent you, me and fangfang. Jennifer, what's in the mail? The information of all interviewers has already been sent. I think this point is very important. We need to focus, you know it is, I'll meet you in the lab. How's fangfang doing? The operation is all set. I don't know how to thank you, for paying for her surgery. Don't worry about it, I just wish to help fangfang. Actually the reason I went to you last time is that our company has developed this defensive arm our. You will be able to become the operator for the arm our, once you pass the our test. There's something I want to tell you before. I have PTSD due to my previous work and I am still on medication. I already knew your condition, even before I went to see you last time. Then why did you choose me? I think when facing a problem, the best solution is not avoiding but facing it. Relax. Don't be stressed out. Everybody. Once you pass the next vr test, you can join us. Any questions? Let's rock and roll. I would like to remind your guys that you tasks are randomly assigned and the testing system is too real. I hope you guys get prepared for any emergency.
