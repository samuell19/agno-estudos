A frantic search is underway today after another young woman has been reported missing in Randolph County. According to local authorities, Kristie Williams, 28, was last seen outside of Karma's Bar & Grill late Friday night.

Catch up, take mine. Thank you. Um, the boys next door offered us shots, so I will be right back. God, look at her. Yeah, she's something special. I think I love her. Aw! If only those boys knew who she was sleeping with tonight. I am a lucky bitch. Yeah you are. Was it you who offered me shots? Oh, anything for you. Thank you. Can I take you up on that? Yeah, of course. Look at you! Thank you. I like your surfboard. - It's pretty nice. - Can you surf on a lake? Yeah. Is is a wakeboard? Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers! Tequila! - All right! - Yeah.

Oh, okay. Can you hold that for a second? Damn! Oh, come on. Thank you. Bye. Hey, what are you doing later tonight? I think we're going to the bar in town. We'll see you there. Okay. Damn! Yes! Tequila! Cheers, ladies! Cheers! Cheers. Let's get stoned. Yes! - No. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! - Come on, yes! - Yes, it's happening. Come on. - Why? - Come on. Ugh! What time is it? Um...

You go. Why me? Because you're the biggest. I mean the tallest. Just go. Go, go, go. Is that Jerry? Oh my God! Hi girls. Jerry, what are you doing here? I brought you these. Thanks. Guys, go finish getting ready while we talk. God, obsessed. So weird! Jerry, I told you this was a girls trip. I know, I know. I called you a few times, and I was worried, and I wanted to make sure that you made it here safely. Thanks. Yeah, there's no service here, so I didn't get your call. But I'm fine, you don't have to worry. But we have plans tonight. You look pretty. You goin' dancin'? Yeah. Thank you. You're always welcome. I'll call you on Sunday. Put those in water. I will. Bye. Officer Jerry to the rescue! Really? Have you blown him yet? I heard he's packing. You guys, be nice! Seriously though, I mean, how big do you think? Think? I think Tamara here already knows. Um, it's been one date. That hasn't stopped you before. Okay, well, we have to be there by nine, so are you ready? No. Oh my god! Then get ready! Oh, thank you. - Hello. - Hello. What can I do for you? Three tequilas please. You guys wanna dance? I have to pee. Is this the line? - Thank you. - Thank you. How much do we owe you? Oh, please, it's on the house. You go enjoy yourselves, all right? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Should we dance? Yeah, should I drink Maddie's? Oh, you're the worst! I'm gonna go check on Maddie, okay? Okay. You got this. Hey, get in line! Pluck your thong! I'm just looking for my friend! Maddie? Yeah. One second. Okay. Want a bump? You won't tell Brooke? No. You can do a bump. I won't tell. You guys have to kiss first. What, no! She's dating my best friend! - No. - Who cares? Yeah, who cares? It's just a peck. - Don't, you don't... - I'm not gonna tell! Okay. It's all over me, isn't it? Thanks. Go now? Oh, my friends are here. You can go now. - Bye. - Bye! Can I get you a drink? Three vodkas with lime. I'm out of limes. Send those to those three ladies down there. Absolutely. These are from the gentlemen at the end of the bar. Oh, how nice! Which ones? Well the two... I don't know where they went, but cheers. Cheers! Where's Tamara? She's probably in the bathroom. Hey! Have you guys seen the girl we were dancing with? Brooke, Brooke, Brooke, she probably met someone. Shit, there's three. We got us a good one, Pa. I'll be the judge of that. Here she is. Ah, shit! She was just here. Well she couldn't have got far. Go find her. Hey, darling. Go get her! God damn. Ain't she the prettiest, Pa? She'll be just fine. I think you've got a present underneath all that wrappin'. Go ahead, boys. I'd stay still for this. Shut your mouth! Ah, let her scream. Ain't nobody gonna hear it way out here. Would you look at those. What are you gonna do? The Lord has a plan for you. You'll never get away with this. Well, we always do. Did you think you are our first one? Hey Pa, ain't that sweet? She thought she was our first angel. We have a family obligation. Pretty things like you come along, can't let 'em leave. So you don't. Well my family has an obligation too. Oh really? Yeah. We curse men like you. Ooh! Are you a witch? Let hell's wrath raineth over. Every pretty thing that you've ever taken will come back to you. You'll see. Oh, I wanna see. What the hell? Oh, she's fucked up! Come on, boys. We'll deal with her later. Fucking idiots. Hey, uh... You don't think any of that witch stuff is real, right? She's not like cursing us or anything, is she? She's just sick from what you gave her. What, are you scared? No. You always been a pussy, Kib. You've run out of stables quicker than I did. You're the pussy. What'd you say? Merv, sit down. I ain't scared. I just never seen a witch before. You want to make sure? Why don't you go down there and check on her. Pussy. I'm gonna get some more coffee. Why don't you get dinner. Call Jerry. Calling Jerry. Shit. Jerry, it's me. Three men have taken me. Shit, no, no, no, no, no! What are you doin' in there, you sexy little bitch? Your ass is mine tomorrow. Or maybe tonight. Kib! God damn it, Kib. Open the door! Open the damn door! Damn it. What the hell are you doing? Open the door! What's wrong with you? What are you doing? What do you mean? You locked me out. No, I didn't. I was drying my clothes. Stupid liar. Grab my keys. Fuck! Put your hands together. Dear Lord, thank you for this day and delivering us a soul that we can save. Your beautiful angel will be coming home soon. Thank you for this food, and let it nourish our bodies and give us strength and make us strong. In your name we pray. Amen. And the Lord wants a husband to have control in the home. He wants the... That the husband needs to take... What did I say about my private time? What did I tell you? Not to disturb you after dinner. Well don't let it happen again, or you'll be sorry. Outside of marriage, but rather in the holy matrimonial bed, where Jesus is present and watching - what is going on. - Shit! Get the hell in here! Oh, hell nah! That wasn't there a minute ago. Did you do this? No, Pa. It's the curse! It ain't no damn curse! If you knew how to dig a hole, this wouldn't have happened! Now get that mess cleaned up! You heard Pa. Clean it up. I knew it. We caught us a witch. Check her ropes. They're tight. How did you do it? Do what? Don't play dumb, girl! The bones! Don't lie to me. Looks like she needs to learn about repentance, Pa. What the hell is that? I don't know. Let's get to the house. We've got beautiful sunny skies and mild fall... That are just perfect for this time of the year. There's no rain in the forecast, which is perfect for us and the festival tonight. We're super excited to have this beautiful weather after so mach rain during the summer. - Today's high temperature... - James, it's me! Three men have taken me... Today's temperatures are not going to fluctuate much. It's going to be 78 degrees in Asheboro. Hey, this is Tamara. You know what to do. And 80 down in Troy. Tonight should be - absolutely perfect. - Hey, this is Tamara. You know what to do. We look forward to a weekend of fine, beautiful weather. Shh. I ain't gonna hurt you. I just came to talk to you. If I move my hand, you promise not to scream? I grew up knowing the Lord is my shepherd. I ain't never met a witch before. Pa and Merv have made me do some things, but only so they could be saved from their wickedness. Who? All the other girls we sent to heaven. Pa says if we sacrifice them, they can all be saved. Do you really believe that? Pa says the Bible teaches us how to live while we're here. We have to give them our seed so they can go to heaven so they can make angel babies in heaven. And that makes good people down here. You see? But if you're a witch and we give your soul to the Devil, you won't make angel babies. You'll make devil babies. So I don't know what to do. Kib. You can't hurt any more girls. You can't hurt me. The Lord wants you to be happy and treat people kindly. He doesn't want you to kill them. Those girls were just girls. They weren't angels. So just please let me go. So you ain't a witch? No. They you'll go the heaven! That's great. Thank you. I knew you were an angel. You sure are a pretty thing. Kib, please, no, no, no! Kib, come back! Kib! Shit! Pa! Pa, you all right? Pa? She's the Devil. That girl is the Devil. What is this shit? These are our angels, Pa. The Devil has sent those girls back to haunt us. You came into this world wicked, and you never changed. The Devil has consumed you. It is time to cleanse your body and soul. Do you accept God in your heart? Do you accept God in your heart? Girl, this is the last time I try to save you. Do you accept God in your heart? Okay, okay! I accept God in my heart! That's my angel. Burn those. Go finish the hole. I can't. What'd you say? She's not an angel. She won't go to heaven. You'd rather have the Devil walking this earth, giving us hell? Go! Sorry, we're closed! Deputy Walker. I'm looking for three girls that were here last night. One in particular. Yeah, I remember her, and her friends. They were pretty wild. They had this whole place crawlin' for 'em. Even had a couple fellas buy 'em some drinks. You happen to know what these guys look like? Kinda rough lookin'. Beards. One of 'em had glasses. Maybe mid-20s. So you didn't catch their name or where they were going? No, sorry. You got security cameras. Is it possible to get ahold of these tapes? Yeah, we got the cameras, but to be honest with you, we don't run tapes. They wouldn't open or anything like that? No, they paid in cash. Okay, well... here's my card. You go ahead a give me a call if you hear or see anything. Yeah, absolutely. Will do. Dear God, thank you for the day. I was weak and you gave me strength. I see what faith is now. Pa always tells me I need to have more faith in you, and I got that today. Thank you. ♪ Mercy in the morning ♪ ♪ Mercy in the morning ♪ Whatcha doin'? Kib, I don't want to hurt you. You can't hurt me. I'm saved. Saved? But I thought you only could be saved if you were sacrificed. If you're an angle, wouldn't you want to be in heaven? I ain't an angel. I'm the Lord's worker. Well you see, Kib, an angel is the Lord's worker, so, if you were an angel, you'd be in heaven, wouldn't you be? But you're here on earth, so therefore you're working for my leader. You're just a slave of the Devil. I ain't no Devil slave. Then prove it. If you're not a Devil slave, then sacrifice yourself and be an angel for the Lord. Look. You already dug yourself a hole. Now get back, Devil slave! Move, Devil slave! I ain't no Devil slave! You sure look like a Devil slave. Did the Lord tell you to kill all those girls? He told Pa. Well, only angels talk to the Lord. I think that you've been working for the Devil the whole time. You're a liar! Have bad things been happening to you? Have you been seeing things? How'd you know? The Devil's inside you, Kib. Your name is written in his book. As long as you're here, you're working for him. You're a liar! I ain't no slave to the Devil! Just a wolf in sheep's clothing. Now get back! The Lord is my shepherd. I will serve him for all eternity. No! Kib! I'm an angel. I'm so sorry, Kib. Shit! Kib! Fucker! Merv? Kib? Pa? Pa? Kib? Pa? Pa? Merv? Kib! Oh, shit! Oh, Kib. I've let you down, boy. I'm so sorry. Well, that was easy. Stupid asshole. You piece of... What took you so long? Don't even. It's about that time, girls. Ugh! Perfect. Hi, boys! Kib was right. You are the fucking Devil. Who in the hell are they? Oh, I'm sorry! I'm so rude! This is Brooke, and this is Maddie. They're my besties. Merv, you remember them, don't you? Go fuck yourself. You damn witch! Ah, the witch talk again. You do have a point. We are fucking magical! What are you gonna do? Ah, don't worry. Nothing that you wouldn't have done to us. We could've just called the police, made it a lot easier on ourselves. But the justice system kinda sucks. And more importantly, where's the fun in that. Here's the deal. You fell into our little trap, just like all those innocent girls fell into yours. Oh, they look confused. Should we fill them in? We've been watching you. We knew your every fucking move! What does it feel like to wake up in a place unexpected? Is it terrifying? Fuck you! Shut up! You're our bitches now. And you're gonna do anything that we say. Is this what you want? Oh, look. It is. You know... it's a shame. If you weren't such a sick fuck, we'd probably sleep with you. Unfortunately, you won't be needing this where you're going. Wait, wait! Fuck! You're pathetic. You actually think I'd waste a bullet on that sorry thing? Nah. We have something way more fun in store for you. Tell 'em, girls. We're gonna play a little game called 16 Angels. Why 16 Angels, you ask? Because that's the number of girls you've taken, tortured, raped, and murdered! It's a simple game, really. You get one second to get away for every angel that you've killed. And if not, I'll blow your brains out. Got it? Are you cold? I'm gonna fucking kill you! We'll see about that. Let's play. One angel. Two angels. Three angels. Four angels. Five angels. Six angels. Seven angels. Eight angels. Nine angels. 10 angels. 11 angels. 12 angels. Pa, I can't get it! Sorry, boy. Wait! Wait, wait! No! Officer Jones, this is Deputy Walker. I have shots fired in the area. Route 49, south of Main Street. I'll be patrol checking. Start me a backup. That sounds perfect. Are you sure it's gonna work? Okay. I'll tell her now. I love you. Miss you too. Bye. Brooke says to check your email. Huh. Girls trip.
