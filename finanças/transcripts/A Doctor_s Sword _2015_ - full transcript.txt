(wind whooshing) (seagulls gawking) - This is an heirloom really, the Japanese keep. It's a very old sword. And when the Japanese die, the very wealthy ones, and they have their ashes. And they put their ashes in these little grooves at the back. We have about seven or eight grooves there. So I feel I've seven or eight Japs in the house. So that makes me nervous at times. - I was always curious about it because it was in the house. It was always in the house and we knew there was something special about it because dad had got it in the war. - So we would say to him, "Oh, Dad, tell us about the war and what happened?" And he would say, "Well, "maybe when you're a little bit older." Or, "I'll tell you another time, maybe." And we knew not to probe. And then later on I asked mum, "Did you ever ask dad about the experiences "when you first met him?" And she said, "No, "because really he'd been through so much. "He used to have terrible nightmares "and why bring all that back?" 1979, he had brain surgery, which they think he got a tumor as a result of all the beatings on his head. And he was told to use his mind and think, and just go into his memory. (anxious music) (guns firing) So he did write it all out longhand. And then the book came out. (gentle music) - [Interviewer] What would you say was the single characteristic that enabled you to survive all of that period? - [Aidan] Well, it's a combination really of my Irish Catholic heritage, my family background and lots and lots of luck. (gentle music) (waves crashing) - Well, my father's love growing up in Beara and it was his roots. So even though he traveled the world and was away so long, his heart was still back here. This was it. It was where his grandfather had started the business and where he had grown up. And, you know, home is so important, isn't it? And we saw that all the way through all our travels. This was the place to get back to. This was the Mecca for him. He just adored Beara, in fact he was one of 10. Yep, five girls and five boys. But it was his memories of growing up and his happiness of learning to swim and been so able in the water, it was most important to him. - He was sent away to boarding school and he went to Clongowes Wood. So he had a good education and his interest obviously lay in medicine. So you went to UCC and he studied medicine. I say part time, studying medicine really, considering all the other activities like the swimming and the polo and the general sort of student life really, that was a big part of his thing as well. He graduated in 1938 and at that time it was pretty difficult to get jobs in Ireland. So he went to the UK. (train chugging) (train whistle blowing) And again jobs weren't particularly easy to get there either. - [Aidan] I ran into two more friends of mine who are qualified, it was two Cork chaps, and we had a boisterous evening around the bars of London, finished up in the nightclub sometime, the early hours of the morning and we had, by that time decided we're all going to join one of the services. (upbeat music) And the Navy and the Air Force were the choice between us. and we eventually got one of the hostesses to toss up and it came down on the side of the Air Force. The following morning, three very hung-over young doctors arrived down at the airman street to make inquiries. They were all so glad to see us that we were interviewed, medically examined and accepted and we were out in time to have the first drink in the pubs opening at half past 11. (patrons chattering) - As 1939, obviously war was eminent. But I suppose being young and foolish, if you like, they thought it was a big adventure. (happy music) - I see someone that's kind of interested in my dad, I go over and tell them, well, that's my dad and very proud to tell them. And then if they're really interested, I bring down the sword and the metals. It's a weapon, no matter what, isn't it? But it's such an important part of my dad's life that it's like part of our family. They actually used to test its sharpness by hold it under a cherry blossom tree, shake the tree and as the petals fell, they would be cut in half. (plane engine roaring) (bomb exploding) (tank engine rumbling) - Then the war started and he was sent to France. And I suppose at that time, he thought that that was as far as this war adventure was going to go. (anxious music) - [Aidan] We got to Boulogne and we weren't very popular because most of our chaps were technicians, fitters, rigors, and weren't soldier material as such and so we were much use to the Boulogne people for defending it. (plane engines roaring) (bomb exploding) The German started to dive-bomb us so we had to scrap our lorries and walk. (machine gun firing) (bombs exploding) And we eventually got to the outskirts of Dunkirk where we were formed into a unit and they were marched down the beach. And there, your name was put into a sort of a lotto, if you put it a high number, you'll be told to go back to the beach and wait. If you get a low number you have to stay. (gentle music) (bombs exploding) (fires blazing) We had two bad days and three horrible nights there. You see we were completely defenseless and we were using just what we could dig into the sand, sort of fox holes to protect ourself from the bombing. And a direct hit would've, of course killed us. The whole thing was a dreadful experience in that some men were crying, some praying, some singing, some completely silent, and everybody terrified. (terrifying music) (military music) It was very difficult, you see, because there's a very shallow beach. You had to wade out, really up to your chest very often. And you were pulled onto this boat and then brought out to the bigger boat. (sorrowful music) And quite a number of chaps wounded. Some of them with bullet wounds and not shell wounds. We opened up, what I'd be the dining room of the ferry thing and we started operating and removing. And the first thing removed were two or three bullets. They were British bullets. So we can only assume that they were fired at by some of our own chaps on our own chaps. (waves gently crashing) - This was a photo album, which I came across after many months of searching. Not that I knew what I was searching for. But my mother had always said that somewhere in her possession, there was actually a photograph of the man that had given my father the sword. Then I came across this album, which just contains so much amazing stuff. This was actually the moment when it all started to make sense. That I came across this photograph of a Japanese Officer in his uniform with the sword, with some inscriptions on the back. We had it translated and it says, "To my friend, Dr. MacCarthy. "I give you this as a token of my friendship "and at the outbreak of peace." So I thought that has to it, that has to be the man. I don't know if it's a long shot, but really just hoping that somebody, somewhere in Japan knows something to do with that man or his family really. I mean it's 68 years later now so whether that's too long for families to have moved, to have died out to really not be interested, is the other point. So it's kind of a long shot, but we have by having the photograph, we have at least got a face to sort of tell people about. (airplane engine roaring) (upbeat music) Tokyo. And if possible could I get an aisle seats, please? Thank you, very much. I'm fascinated to find the Kusuno's to see what the relationship between the two was and to find why he would have given my dad such a special gift. My dad never resented the Japanese after the war so it would be fascinating to know what the bond was between these two people. He tried to protect us from all the horrors and the stories, but I think in the back of every child's mind, they want to find out a bit more about what actually happened in their parents lives. (bell jingling) (speaking in foreign language) (anxious music) (plane engine roaring) - [Nicola] Dad had a very kind of active time in France and then when he returned from France in 1941, he was in RF Honington, which was a sort of bomber command station. And he was the senior medical officer on the camp. - And one day a plane came in returning from a mission but the undercarriage didn't come down. - [Aidan] The night Sergeant pilot was his first job as captain. He got back from raiding Germany and he had his red green lights showing on his dashboard which meant that his undercarriage was down but didn't know whether it was locked or not. This chap was told to will come in a bit faster in case his under carriage collapsed. He came in over the perimeter fence. (plane engine roaring) Touchdown and realized that he was going too fast. And he was going for takeoff again to keep going and his wingtips cut the top of a bomb-dump, which was situated at the end of this runway. And he crashed straight into it. (plane exploding) (worrisome music) So we got down the runway with an ambulance and a fire tender. The others all pulled us out, the bomb scattered around, took off. I don't blame them because we are really terrified I don't think you can really think. And the driver of the fire tender, myself jumped in and we found the pilot there and three of the others alive so we pulled those out and got them clear. - He won the George Medal for pulling five men out of the burning plane. But he did say that, he just act in the moment and you go and do it. And when it's life, you know, that's something that a doctor does, but maybe it's just a natural instinct. (heroic music) - There's two newspapers helping us on our search. Oh, crumbs, there he is. (Nicola laughing) That's the one. So that's my father, and that's Mr. Kusuno, that's the gentleman we're looking for. For 68 years these people heard nothing and then suddenly to get a picture of your grandfather in the paper, I mean, they're gonna get a serious shock, I'd imagine. Hopefully a pleasant shock and hopefully one that they'll respond to positively. But I mean, yeah, could you imagine just opening the paper and seeing your grandfather there with somebody searching for him, after all these years. I mean, I hope he doesn't give them too much of a shock, really. (anxious music) - [Aidan] An urgent call came from help Singapore. So we set off. We were carrying the best part of a squadron and a half of Spitfires and Hurricanes in the hulls. Got to Singapore, but it was too late. (guns firing) (canon firing) (fire blazing) - [Nicola] And that's when the next part of his sort of adventure if you like started. So he went to Java, then they were sent to Sumatra and then back to Java again. Because the Japanese were kind of closing in on everywhere. (anxious music) - [Aidan] When we got to Java, it was a complete shambles because the Japs were beginning to do landings all right in Java. (soldiers feet bashing) (cannon booming) (gun firing) (soldiers yelling) (sorrowful music) (flies buzzing) - Then Java was captured by the Japanese and it's in the culture that you lose face, if you are captured and that you're just despicable and should be treated thus. He was in a camp in Java for over two years. He was treated very badly. (troubled music) - [Aidan] They shouted at us, slapped you and they kicked you. And they shot and beheaded several people for not reacting quickly to the thing. And if you attain any thought of making an escape or... (gun firing) It was terror, terror. (anxious music) - They were obsessed about food because their rations were just so meager, they had nothing. They used to just almost hallucinate about food, but just try and think of meals and there's one, I think it was a bit of trading done and they got a tin and he thought it was hot dogs which he kept for Christmas Day and it was buried in the corner of a camp. So on Christmas Day, when he opened the tin, it was asparagus. And actually he never touched asparagus ever again. - [Aidan] We'd creamed off the dirty rice, we stained it and the maggots, we then collected and we boiled those and turned those into a maggot soup, which we give to the sick. And fortunately we got a hold of some live yeast cultures and the chemists, especially the Dutch chemist amongst us soon got to work. Well, we're adding that as a yeast product to our rice pap, especially to the sick. Most of them were living on reserves. - This was a water bottle that was cut in half. That's what my dad would've got his rice with the maggot soup in. Amazing how he just thought to bring it back though, as well. You'd think you'd just wanna throw it away. (concerning music) - [Aidan] We tried experiments about different types of diets to see if we could cure beriberi and various deficiency diseases that were springing up. - [Adrienne] Of course there was no penicillin or anything in those days, but when they got shaving foam he looked at the ingredients and he realized that this could be used to treat certain infections. And he did. - [Aidan] My first bad date was when I was going to, well we were isolating the dysentery cases and normally I had to pass the guards, guards were sitting inside of what would be the front porch. And when I got there, there was no guards, but there was a monkey on a stand beside where the guards had been, so I saluted the monkey but unfortunately one of the guards had come back and he saw me and he told the others. - I think my dad, probably did regret it because he was dragged and kicked and punched and beaten half to death really. And that's why he had a very bad elbow and tram-line of operations. And actually his arm was so bad even after the beating that they had to remove a cartilage which was done with no anesthetic and he was almost telling them what to do until he actually passed out from the pain. And then I mean, he was so lucky not to have got it infected and to have survived it. - In 1944, around 1300 prisoners were transported to Japan in a cargo boat. It was infested with rats. (anxious music) (troublesome music) - [Aidan] Just about five to midnight, I was sitting up fighting with a rat, it had got caught in a bit of mosquito netting. I was terrified and I think the rat was too, but he saved my life. (boat siren blaring) (torpedo whizzing) (torpedo exploding) - The boat was struck by a torpedo from an American submarine. He looked around and nobody else seemed to be getting up. And he realized then that with the steel hold ship, the torpedo who'd actually reverberated and broken the necks, whiplash breaks to everybody that was laying down. (anxious music) - [Aidan] So I got up and all the lights have gone out. The water was beginning to come in. (water rushing) I got out, maybe a minute before the ship sank. I swim the best 50 yards of my life. (fire blazing) - [Adrienne] He was in the water for over 12 hours and they were just hanging on to bits of wreckage trying to survive. - [Aidan] So we were hanging onto wreckage and you're really discovering people during the night and then they discovered me, the doctor and they were shouting for help and I was doing a surface surgery, I was swimming from one bit of wreckage to the other, tying up broken collarbones and trying to splinter broken legs. - Eventually they were actually picked up by a Japanese destroyer. And I suppose, because they were covered in oil and dirt and blood, and God knows what, the Japanese didn't know who they were picking up. If it was POWs or if it was actually the crew off the Japanese cargo boat. - [Aidan] They gave us rice bowls to start with. We were naked, you see. And then I don't know, but suddenly going, what we were, or who we were. They started beating us up and throwing us overboard. Some of the chaps were hitting, they were not fully conscious, they were been caught in the screws of the propellers. There was an awful lot of red blood. But a bunch of us from the top we saw was happening, we dived overboard. A destroyer going at speed is a very difficult thing to get off. But we swam back to our bits of wreckage. (anxious music) We'd been 22 hours in the water then and we were trying to make up our mind, whether we'd stay there or try and get to one of the islands, which were away in the distance. (waves gently splashing) And a bunch of about five or six boats came into view and they were Japanese whaling boats. And they just start picking everybody else up and took us into Nagasaki. - So this area in the docks would've been approximately where my father would've disembarked from the fishing or from the whaling boat. I'd say they were very glad to get back onto dry land after so many traumatic days that they'd experienced at sea. From been a prisoner of war for sort of three years before that, so they were very undernourished. They were mentally and physically damaged. Then plus the trauma of experiencing all the death and carnage. I mean, of the 780 that were on the transport ship only 38 made it to Nagasaki. When the police saw them arriving with a POWs, they didn't really want them in that state. And they told the the whaling boat to take them back out and dump them at sea. But the whaling boat was so anxious to get home after their long trip that they refused and they left them here. So just up there was actually where the camp was, where they were marched to. And that's where they spent the next year. They were initially put to work in the shipyards where they were building some sort of big Japanese boat. They then were transferred to the Mitsubishi Factory, which was metal work. But after their time there, then he was transferred to a coal mine where they were actually working for 10 cigarettes a week. (sorrowful music) - [Aidan] The main beatings I got were in Japan when I was in charge of the camp and I was held responsible for any troop didn't work hard enough or was caught infringing. I also had to get it, 'cause I was answerable for it. - There was a lot of brutality. And it was a ripple effect with the beatings that if someone did something wrong, it went from the top down. So everybody got beaten anyway. (tram rattling) - I was just thinking that the wire netting there at the top, actually still makes it still look reminiscent of what you could imagine they would have had in the camp. There's no way across that fence now. Just like there wasn't then. I wonder what the people in the factory thought when they saw people in the camps outside. Did they really care that they were suffering like they were, or just got on and ignored it? I suppose, war times these things happen. There's no way that you could ever understand or even feel how we would feel, I'd say. I mean, there's nothing we would've experienced that have been any way like it. (train rumbling) Well, he never really said much to us. Really, it was something that was too horrific. He thought as children we were too young and vulnerable to know about, really. Suppose it was only when the book came out, that we just kind of read of the horrors of it. Terrifying, isn't it? (sorrowful music) Actually been in that situation, you needed something to hang on to. You needed some belief, you needed some hope. You know, it was always an escape that you could escape into his faith inside himself. - And one day he tried to imagine the shop, the shelves and what was on the shelves and even the people, he tried to bring this back to him and he couldn't, and he went into a panic because he thought that his mind was gone then. And he could imagine Japanese people actually in the shop. (soldiers yelling) (anxious music) To think that they've taken over your sanctuary would break your heart. That maybe you realize that you are actually been broken in spirit. (birds singing) (speaking in foreign language) - Mrs. Sasamoto, do you have any records of how my father got from Singapore to Japan? - Yes. (speaking in foreign language) - [Nikki] Oh, yeah. (speaking in foreign language) - MacCarthy. - Yes. (speaking in foreign language) - [Taeko] British. (speaking in foreign language) - Also, we have, I found a photograph of Mr. Kusuno. That was the photograph that he gave to my father when he presented him with the sword. And that is also dated on September 45. So we know that they obviously knew each other and that's where he received the sword. That's the sword we have. And then I also have this photograph, which was taken in camp 26. It actually says, camp 26. And again, in September, 1945. So I think that's my father there. (speaking in foreign language) - [Nicola] Yeah, same kind of roof. Yeah, that one as well. (speaking in foreign language) - Is that different, that's different. - British? - British, yeah, maybe. But that one-- - Yes, yes. - It says on the back, R.A.F. and Dutch doctor. Four Warrant Officers. Royal Navy, British Army. Royal Navy, Australian. Camp 26, Fukuoka, Kyushu Island, Japan. (speaking in foreign language) - [Adrienne] There was a bit of trading done at the fences, so they were able to put these crystal radio sets together. So they knew that things were coming and of course the air raids and the bombings were getting worse and worse. So luckily they were allowed to build a shelter for themselves. (plane engine roaring) (machine gun blasting) (plane engine whining) (plane exploding) - [Nicola] As the Japanese was starting to panic and knowing that the inevitable was happening they got them to take this big, deep trench. (anxious music) - So they were digging away and then they saw a wooden platform thing been put up at the far end and they realized that they were digging their own grave, a mass grave and they would just be machine gunned into it. And as he was digging, he said he could actually imagine himself been shot and just laying there. Which was just so, so sad. - [Aidan] Around about midday, lovely bright August morning, we saw the aid vapor trails in two lots of four. So that immediately, the rest of us, we shut down for the air raid shelter to get in quickly. (emergency siren blaring) (plane engine humming) Three parachutes came out and there was this blinding flash. (bomb booming) And we were in the shelter, so we felt the warm air, but nothing more. (flames blazing) And then one of the Australians stuck his head out and it was his blasphemous remarks that made us all shoot for the opening and look out. (anxious music) And there was no camp. Gone. And the day turned to darkness. (sorrowful music) I couldn't see any Nagasaki, just things sticking up here and there. And then fires everywhere and smoke and screaming. Then a horrible thing started, black rain. This was terrifying. I personally thought it was the end of the word. (anxious music) (eerie music) (terrifying music) - [Nicola] I mean, it's hard to imagine that within one second the whole factory, the whole camp, the whole city that's been your prison camp is just raised to the ground. (terrifying music) - [Aidan] And we all veered then for the mountain to get out. 'Cause we were in a valley and down the middle of this valley there was a river and some of the chaps got stuck in that, you see, with the mud. We had an awful job pulling them out. And we were stopping now and again, to help people we suddenly realized that it was useless because one of the chaps pulled some woman and her complete skin came off her face. And another chap was trying to help a child and the child's arm came away, complete. The thing was obviously that, you know something beyond our and we kept, we kept running. - [Nicola] People had been very much injured in the blast and the aftermath, they had caves in the hills which were actually made into small little surgeries. - [Adrienne] The makeshift hospital in the caves and he went up and just did what he could for prisoners and Japanese. Those sort of radiation burns and blindness, so not knowing really what had happened, he just used whatever he could to help these people. - [Aidan] But it was quite useless because most of the people they were bringing in were dead. Most of the people treating them were already dying. And we, we stayed there then and helped the Japs best we could with the things. And they were very frightened as we were. (sorrowful music) We were eventually rounded up by the Japanese Police, the camp type. And they took us outside like a second, stuck us in, what I imagined was been a small schoolhouse and then we had to help cremate bodies. - After what he'd been through, he'd been in Java for nearly three years as a prisoner, then transported up to the Japanese mainland, torpedoed on the way up and then to be in Nagasaki and the atomic bomb dropped to be recaptured after all that when you think you've got freedom, it's terrible. (birds singing) (speaking in foreign language) - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. (speaking in foreign language) - When they transferred the prisoners from Nagasaki to here, did they come by train? (speaking in foreign language) - So it must've take quite a long time from Nagasaki? (mumbling in foreign language) - 12 Hours. - Yes? (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - [Nicola] Oh, right, yeah, yeah. (speaking in foreign language) - [Nicola] Yeah, you can see there. (speaking in foreign language) - Thin. - Yeah, yeah. (speaking in foreign language) (anxious music) - [Aidan] We were in this camp and they stopped us working, they started to give us some extra food. And then they were very nice to us, the Japs guards. And the next thing, all the Japs disappeared and they came back in their best uniforms and they put a radio up in front of the Commandants office on a table and they all assembled. And then this voice came out of the radio and they all bowed. (speaking in foreign language) (crickets chirping) - [Aidan] The interpreter was standing over and things so we asked him one thing. And he called me Major, instead of a number. I was Ichiban number one, he was crawling, you see (chuckles). So I said, "It's all over, isn't it?" And he said, "Yes." And I turned around to the Japs, let's go and find the Commandant. - The rest of the prisoners really wanted to tear him apart but my dad stepped in and just said that they must wait because he realized that help would be coming. So he made sure that the commander of the camp was kept separate. Later the camp commandant gave the sword to my father. We don't if it was to saving his life or had they built up some kind of friendship. (birds singing) - [Nicola] Very nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. (speaking in foreign language) - Right, that's interesting. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Well, that's interesting. Very interesting. (speaking in foreign language) - That's what both countries wanted at the end. To just be able to live normally again and have peace. So he was looking forward to it as much as my father was as well. (sorrowful music) - [Aidan] The Americans flew over the following day and dropped an awful lot of food and clothing and medicines. And then they dropped pamphlets all over the countryside to the Japanese won and that they'd be shot, if they were caught with even an empty tin of rations or anything. And if they found any of the parachutes, they were to bring them to the nearest camp. And they did. - He realized then that he was the senior officer in the camp and someone had to take charge. So he did. And he just kind of tried to keep things in control and he issued this order. At 09;15 hours yesterday, the 2nd of September, you ceased to be prisoners of war. This camp is now a British Military establishment under my command. From the very beginning I want it to be understood that the rules and regulations as laid down by me, together with military discipline will be maintained. I am now responsible to our government for each one of you I intend to see to it that you return home safe and sound and without a cloud of any sort on your military records. J.A. MacCarthy. Squadron-leader. Commanding. (heartfelt music) - [Nicola] My dad was very lucky. He survived been a prisoner. He survived the radiation, the brutality, and then he was free at last. (plane engines humming) - It was quite a journey of started from Japan, they went by ship to San Francisco. Then they went by train across to the east coast of America. By November, I think he managed to get back to Dublin. He came up to the docks in Dun Laoghaire with plenty of kit bags on the sword. And he was 14 and a half stone leaving but seven stone coming home. But my aunt tells me how they went to meet him and he still had that cheeky smile coming up the gangplank. (uplifting music) The most emotional bit was the telegram from my grandmother that she sent to my dad when he arrived back into Dublin. And it just made it full circle as well. It said, "A thousand welcomes from your loving mother." (gentle music) She'd had a stroke in the meantime, because she had also lost a son, the priest in the last bomb that was dropped on London during the war. It was like she just hung on for him, she died on Christmas Eve that year. (sorrowful music) He got the OBE and the Pacific Service Stars and then he got a Papal Award as well, he became a Knight of St. Sylvester. I think it's just for goodness you have done and I think his bravery was realized even in the spiritual side. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (exciting music) - [Nicola] I'm Nikki MacCarthy. - Ah, nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. - And he, Satpso Kusuno. - Kusuno, yes. So you're grandson of. Very nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. Very nice to meet you. - And his mother, Mitchko. - Yes. (speaking in foreign language) Younger sister. - Oh, lovely. - Cody. - Glad that we found you. (speaking in foreign language) - Oh, this is, oh... I'd like to show you that I have found, about four weeks ago, I found this photograph which your grandfather gave to my father. And you'll see there's a lovely inscription on the back as well. Did you see, oh, excuse me. Did you see that was the photograph with the inscription? (speaking in foreign language) - I was just gonna say, how did you feel when you saw the article in the paper asking for us, or looking for contact. (speaking in foreign language) - Oh, you didn't know, oh, right. (speaking in foreign language) - Yeah, my father was the same that he didn't talk about it. You know, that's why it's taken us this long to meet you. (speaking in foreign language) - Oh, that's lovely. Oh, that's beautiful photograph, isn't it? So it must've been a very sad occasion as well. And after the war, did your grandfather stay in the military or did she leave the military? (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - We heard a possibility that in the camp in Keisen there were, I think it was 197 Australians and just fewer of the allied forces and that after Japan surrendered that the Australians were very keen to kill as many Japanese officers as they could. And that my father had taken your grandfather and locked him in a shed or in an office and he wouldn't let the Australians get to him to kill him. And then it was because of that, he had given the sword. But you didn't have anything? (speaking in foreign language) - What we would like to do is to ask you if you would like to see the sword again, you'd be very welcome to come to Ireland, anytime to come and see any of your family. (speaking in foreign language) - Thank you very much. And thank you. And it's been an honor, an honor. And as I say, I must give you the address now in Ireland and you can come over and bring the family with you. It'll be an honor to see you there. (speaking in foreign language) (emergency siren blaring) (bell ringing) (heartfelt music) (audience applauding) (bell ringing) - It's very hard to believe that it actually happened. That any of that happened, let alone to my father. You know, in relatively recent times, I mean, it's still in so many people's memories and to think that such barbarism. And it probably still goes on today and people will be telling the same story in years to come. But it was always very difficult when he was alive to actually believe really that he'd been through that and to come out relatively unscathed. - And I know it's a different generation and I know time moves on but it was still three and a half years of my dad's life. And I think, suppose just that fact that really mankind hasn't learned from that. You know, that's the sad thing as well. It's still going on in different parts of the world now. - [Nicola] I think that's why the sword was something important to him. It was a sign of humanity. (heartfelt music) - One day he was sitting on the lounge watching television and I was pottering around and when I went in, I saw his hand hanging by the stairs out by the side of the chair, and to find he had a very bad stroke. Very bad stroke. - He had done an interview for RTE and they said, Oh, it'll be on at some future date. And he said, Oh, they've forgotten about me, that'll never be on. And then the day that he actually got a stroke in England, and got sick, they rang to say, "Oh, that's going to be on in a week's time." And my mom said, "Well, I can't talk now, "'cause he's just going off in the ambulance." And they said, "Oh no, we'll cancel it." And we said, no, no, you know, we'd love it to be on and it'll be great. - And I stayed with him all night long. And during the night the doctor called me and he said, "You know, it's sad news for you. "There's very little hope." And I said, "Well, will I ring Ireland?" And he said, "Yes, ring them." And I rang home here and he'll bring him home with me. And then next day, that was it. (sorrowful music) (waves softly crashing) - So he passed away within 24 hours. And then we brought his body back to Castletownbere, his roots and his heart were here. And the day that he was buried, the program was on the radio. So people were down in the hotel and then it was like my dad had the final word and people just stood up and applauded at the end of it. And it was just amazing. - [Interviewer] What would you say was the single characteristic that enabled you to survive all of that period? - [Aidan] Well, it's a combination really of my Irish Catholic heritage, my family background and lots and lots of luck.
