(dramatic music) (ominous music) (radio static crackles) - Henry. Henry, come in. Henry, you there? (radio static crackles) [Henry] Yeah, yeah, I'm here, Sheriff. What's your 20? [Sheriff] Canyon Road and 3rd. I'm on my way back in. (radio static crackles) - Copy that. Any ID on the drifter? [Sheriff] Not yet, Henry. I'll check up on him when I get there. Now meet me out front. (radio static crackles) - Copy. (soft ominous music) He's quiet. Had to calm him down just a little. Found him out back in the gravel quarry. Got feisty for no reason I could figure. [Henry] Why does he look so weird? Well, he's probably on somethin'. Yeah, well, you better call Doc Walter. You probably gave him a concussion. One thing at a time, Henry. One blessed thing at a time. Get him inside first. Let's go, pal. (brakes squeak) Doc's here. Hey, Tom. He's in the back. Been pretty quiet, but Henry'll show you back and stay with ya. I was just sitting down to dinner, Jake. Well excuse hell outta me, but I wasn't plannin' on pickin' up any drifters tonight, myself. Then why didn't you just let him drift? Hey, Tom. He had this on him. What is it? Anyone think to ask him? (officer chattering on radio) (pills rattling) (officer chattering on radio) (soft ominous music) [Henry] Here we go, Doc. (electricity zaps) Ah, damn power. (electricity zaps) (soft ominous music continues) (soft dramatic music) How are you feeling? Doc, he jumped the sheriff. Hell, there's gotta be somethin' wrong with him. What's your name? He won't say. Hell, he hadn't said a damn thing since the sheriff brought him in here. (ominous music) Son of a bitch. Keep your head back. I'll check it in a minute. Do you have any medical condition that we should know about? What was in the bottle they found on you? Can you hear me? Tell me, what was the medication? (suspenseful music) Ephemerol. Ephemerol. (suspenseful music continues) You're a scanner. Aren't you taking the medication? Not anymore. (dramatic music) (soft suspenseful music) (soft ominous music) Henry. Henry? (dramatic tense music) Thank you, Sheriff. (gun fires) (Sheriff groans) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) (rifle cocks) (dramatic tense music) (rifle firing) You're out of ammunition, Sheriff. (rifle clicking) (tires screeching) [Man] Just keep it going, Carrie. We'll splice it all together later. [Director] Fine. Trans-Neural Resource Center, fundraiser, take three. Misconceptions about scanners are as rampant today as they were 15 years ago. In a nutshell, a drug developed to ease pain during pregnancy was found to cause abnormalities in the fetus. The children of these women developed telepathic abilities, but also suffered terrible side effects. Most of these scanners went insane from sensory overload. Ephemerol is a scanning suppressant. Without a Ephemerol, a scanner will go - You look great. Into a delusional state of madness from which he will not recover. Maybe we could get your cop to help us on this fundraising tape. My cop? Detective Staziak? Maybe he could help us raise the money. And this way you two could spend a little time together. Glory, he's a cop. Besides he's not coming tonight for a date. He's looking for his mother. Honey, they basically all are. I'll let you know when he gets here. But an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. (soft ominous music) Look, guys, you're gonna have to come in when the doctor's here. We can't keep dispensing Ephemerol like this, okay? A little illegal. Are you gonna arrest me, Detective Staziak? I don't think so. Oh, darn. No handcuffs? Just a minute, I'll get Carrie for you. (soft suspenseful music) [Girl] Get away from me. No! [Craig] (chuckles) Your turn, little girl. - No! - Cut it. - No! - All yours, big brother. (Craig cackles) (girl yelps) [Karl] Now, we're gonna play nice. (girl screams) [Officer] Freeze! (soft suspenseful music continues) I'm really sorry. It's almost as if your birth mother didn't wanna be found. I just keep going around in circles. (sighs) I'm a cop and I can't even find my mother. There's still a chance we'll come up with something. I know you're giving it your best shot, I really do. Can I take you to dinner, to say thanks? Dinner? (beeper beeping) I got an emergency call. Guess tonight's just not my night. I really do appreciate the invitation. I'll call if I find anything new. Thanks. You got my number. [Girl] Oh! No, no! [Officer] Freeze! [Karl] Take a hike, cop. [Craig] Karl, what the fuck? (gun fires) [Karl] Craigy! (soft suspenseful music) Wanna come check out my new loft? I'm buyin' the pizza. J.J.'s buyin' the beer. I'm actually gonna stick around here tonight. There's one other lead I'm following up on Sam's mother. I don't wanna tell him about it unless it checks out. Don't work too late, okay? See you tomorrow. (dramatic music) What is goin' on down there? Are they doin' anything? [Billy] Gimme a second, I gotta get back to the lobby. [Kidnapper] Come on, is anything happening? Nothin', they're just sittin' out there. Captain, what do we got? Staziak. I've got a half a dozen bad guys tried to kidnap Joseph Gibbs, head of Gibbs Petrochemical. Plant security got in the way, things went bad, now they got Gibbs and several hostages up there in that control room. If we don't let 'em go in 10 minutes, they say they're gonna kill 'em and blow this plant sky high. Wouldn't be a pleasant sight. Let me tell you something, partner, these guys are through negotiating. It's up to you. Okay, I need a vest and a headset. You got it. Anything else? Maybe a psychiatrist. Must be outta my fuckin' mind. (suspenseful music) Shit. (phone dialing) Mullins. What the fuck is goin' on? Where's my goddamn helicopter? Hey look, we just got a chopper big enough for you and all your hostages. Now you gotta work with me on this, all right? Just sit tight, pal. It's not gonna be long now. You better hurry up 'cause you ain't got enough body bags to go around! (dramatic music) (fax machine whirring) (phone buttons beeping) (phone ringing) [Sam] Hi, this is Sam. Leave a message and I'll call ya back later. (answering machine beeps) Hi, Sam. This is Carrie. I think we just got lucky. After you left, a lead came in on your mother. We may have found her. I thought scanners had to take drugs to block their powers or they go nuts. Most do, but Staziak's been takin' a special form of Ephemerol. Lets him scan without the problems he had before. (suspenseful music) [Kidnapper] Billy, check the back doors. Right. (suspenseful music continues) Thanks, dickhead. No problem, Officer. (tense music) How many friends you got upstairs? Three. Mully, three more suspects upstairs. Three upstairs. How many hostages? How many hostages you holding? Four. Four hostages, Mully. Billy, what the? (gun cocks) (henchman grunts) (gun butt thuds) (Billy grunts) Sam. Sam? The fuck is goin' on up there? Sam, talk to me. (radio static crackles) [Sam] I can handle it, Mully. Just keep everybody in position. Billy! Billy, where are you goddamn it? Get down there now! (tense music) (kidnappers groaning) (kidnappers crying out) (henchman screaming) (soft ominous music) Mullins, you lying fuck. Ya just ran outta time, cop! Billy, where the hell have you been? What the hell's goin' on downstairs? (tense music) (bomb beeping) (phone dialing) All right, Mullins, you listen up. Walkin' outta here in five minutes and I wanna see that fuckin' helicopter. If anything isn't right, I'm gonna blow this place to next July. You got that, pig? (tense music continues) (bomb beeping) All right, Billy, let's untie that old man. Wait. Gimme the detonator. (tense music continues) (bomb beeping) Boss, the hell ya doin'? (static crackles) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (Sam grunting) (suspenseful music) (bomb beeping slowly) (kidnapper grunts) (bomb beeping rapidly) (suspenseful music) (Sam groans) (Sam panting) Sam. (phone ringing) Mullins. [Sam] It's all clear, Mully. Have 'em stand down Cap, he's got it. Well, I guess that new form of Ephemerol works pretty well after all, wouldn't you say? Yeah, the wonders of modern science. (soft suspenseful music) (copier whirring) (suspenseful music continues) (computer beeping) (suspenseful music continues) (phone buttons beeping) (suspenseful music continues) [Operator] 911, what is your emergency? Yes, this is Carrie Goodart at the Trans-Neural Resource Center. I need to report an intruder. [Operator] Yes, ma'am. Can you tell me anything about the intruder? - Oh, God help me. What is the nature of the intrusion? Ma'am? (soft dramatic music) (Karl grunts) (chuckles) You're trying to scan me. [Operator] Speak to me. [Karl] I can feel it. [Operator] Is the intruder there with you? Barely. You take Ephemerol every day, don't you? It takes away your power. Well, I gave it up, and now I'm gonna show you what scanning is really all about. (tense music) (operator chattering) (tense music continues) (Carrie whimpers) How do I get into the computer? No. (tense music continues) Fix it. (tense music intensifies) (computer beeps) Ss. (computer beeping) (tense music continues) (Carrie gasps) (soft ominous music) (chair squeaking) (soft ominous music continues) (Carrie gasps) (tense music) (Karl sighs) (whimpers) What are you doing? I'm hungry for you. You have something that's making me stronger, your life force. And I want more. (tense music intensifies) (siren blaring) Call a medic. She's in shock. (soft suspenseful music) (soft ominous music) (suspenseful music) (glass breaking) (phone buttons beeping) You're all set, Detective. Thanks. (phone dialing) I'd say you're gonna be pretty sore tomorrow. I'm pretty sore now, Mully. [Carrie] Hi, Sam, it's Carrie. I think we just got lucky. After you left, a lead came in on your mother. We may have found her. So, give me a call at the center first thing in the morning. Bye. So what's up? I don't wanna jinx it, but I got some pretty good news. New lady? Maybe two. Two? In your dreams, pal. Call me in the morning. Wait a minute, you're serious. What, have you got a date? Wait, you're supposed to tell me about these things. I'm your partner. (soft suspenseful music) (mimics rifle firing) (soft suspenseful music) (dog barking) (soft suspenseful music continues) Eh, bills. (keys rattling) (suspenseful music) Shit! (rifle fires) (Sam grunts) (grunts) That son of a... (suspenseful music) (tense music) (Karl cries out) (Sam grunts) (Karl grunts) (gun firing) Police! Freeze! I'm a cop. This is my home. Look, man, drop the gun. Down on the ground, face down. I'm gonna turn around, okay? Real slow here, so don't shoot. I'm gonna show you my badge. Who was it, man? I don't know. I didn't see him. Look, we're gonna take a look around. No! You don't know what you're up against. Neither do I. (siren blaring) (group chattering) (soft tense music) (Jones grunting) Oh. Oh, what've we got here? (ominous music) 60. Oh, just hit the ATM, huh, sweetheart? (chuckles) Nice. Come to papa. Make sure nobody sees. (Jones chuckling) (dramatic music) Volkin. What the fuck are you doin' here? Old habits die hard, huh, Jonesy? Still on the same old corner. Hey man, what are you doin' here? You sick or somethin'? I'm hungry! Hey, man, fuck you. Go to a restaurant. I ain't got not food. I don't want food. Eh, here. Is Ephemerol what you want? (chuckles) Definitely not. Okay, well then beat feet, man. I got work to do. I don't need your sick pasty ass hangin' around here. Ya hear me? Oh. (Jones chuckles) (tense music) (Jones cries out) (Jones grunting) Please. All right. Come on, you can have the money. I don't want the money. Well, what do you want? Staziak, and you're gonna help me. The cop? How can I help you get the... I'll show you. Just tonight, Jonesy, at the scanner center I learned something new. You're going to give me all the strength and power I need to kill him. (Jones chuckles) (tense music) No, no, come on. Please, don't. Oh, hey. (Jones grunting) (tense music intensifies) (Jones crying out) (skin crackling) (tense music crescendoing) (Jones grunting) (dramatic music) Yes! (sighs) The power. (Karl grunts) Was it good for you, Jonesy? (soft suspenseful music) [Jim] So you didn't get anything at all from the scan? [Sam] Nothin'. Look, I don't get it. If the guy's a scanner, what's he usin' a shotgun for? Because I'm a stronger scanner than he is and there's something about a shotgun that's pretty decisive. Yeah, good point. (chuckles) Detective, communications said to give this to you. Do me a favor, take that down to SID for prints and ID on the suspect. You got it, sir. What? Hit by lightning? (siren blaring) I need a room. We're full. (tense music) Fill out this registration card, please. Thank you, sir. (tense music continues) Have a nice night. I will. (camera clicks) Holy Hell. Like to know where we get some lightning out here is what I wanna know. Oh, Jesus. Any idea who he is? Take your pick. Must be a half a dozen wallets there. What the hell happened to him? I never seen anything like this. I thought you were supposed to be the expert. Not me. (soft ominous music) Ephemerol. I think I know who to call. Tell forensics to get us those photos ASAP. You got it. Listen, you wanna take this, and run this as quick as you can. (officer chattering on radio) (phone buttons beeping) [Officer] 10-4. (phone ringing) - Watkins. - Hello? [Watkins] Yeah? Is this the Trans-Neural Resource Center? [Watkins] Yeah. I'm trying to reach Carrie Goodart. [Watkins] Who am I speaking to? Sam Staziak, I'm a detective with LAPD. Who's this? [Watkins] Sergeant Watkins from Rampart's. Carrie Goodart was attacked here tonight. What? [Watkins] She was unconscious when they took her away. When? [Watkins] We're just wrapping up here. Ambulance left about three hours ago. What hospital is she in? (dramatic music) Excuse me, I'd like to see Carrie Goodart, please. Oh, we're running tests. She's in a shock-induced state of unconsciousness. From what? If you can tell me that I'll give you my diploma. You know she's a scanner, right? It still doesn't explain why she's unconscious. Look, I'm sorry, but I gotta finish my rounds. She's in 213. - Thank you. - Sure. (machines beeping) (Sam sighs) Pretty girl. Yeah. [Nurse] Dr. Valentino to the OR, please. (machines beeping) Hi, Carrie. It's Sam. Wish she could tell us what happened. What are you doing? Run interference for me, Mully. Yeah, you got it. I'm sorry. Gonna need your help on this one. (machines beeping) (tense music) Show me who did this to you. (tense music continues) Good girl. What is going on in here? It's all right, we're police officers. Excuse me. It's all right, trust me. Okay? [Nurse] I need an orderly. Orderly, I need some help here. (tense music continues) Hey! Get away from her! (dramatic music) (Carrie screams) (machine alarms blaring) [Jim] Get off him, buddy. (machine alarms blaring) She's coding. Mully! [Jim] Come here, Doc. (tense music) (machine alarms blaring) (electricity zapping) (Carrie crying out) (both panting) [Nurse] Dr. Valentino to the OR, please. Dr. Valentino to the OR, please. (Sam panting) Karl Volkin. Who is he? A guy I arrested a few years ago. Are you okay? [Nurse] Paging Dr. Vizandia. Call 198. Dr. Vizandia. - Mully. How'd he do this? I'm just a nurse. Who is this guy? He's a scanner. I sent him away right after I made detective. Him and his brother had taken a girl hostage. His brother didn't make it. What the hell's he want? He wants me. What did he do to Carrie? I don't know, but let's get an APB out on him. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna stay here in case he tries something else. All right. I'll call you in the morning. (soft suspenseful music) (officers chattering) Thanks. Sam, got a bulletin from Las Cruces Psychiatric. Volkin escaped last night. I got his package here. You were right about him, bad news. Staziak. Oh, and a North Division says they might have a line on a witness from last night. Thanks, Mully. What happened last night? That should explain it? Karl Volkin's escaped from Las Cruces. Shit. Well, it's your people, Sam. You call it. What's the agenda? He's not my people. This guy's a fucking murderer. (phone ringing) Yeah. Yeah, he's here. Transfer it in. Staziak. Do you know who this is? (suspenseful music) Yeah, yeah, how could I forget? Mullins! Trace, line four. Why didn't you stick around earlier, Karl? I hate it when people shoot and run. Oh, I'm coming back after you, Staziak. And you won't be able to stop me next time. Why don't you just cut the shit, huh? You want me, here I am. Soon. (dramatic music) (dial tone humming) (sighs) Phone booth in South Central. Communication's is gonna send a unit. I know, he'll be long gone by the time they get there. We got a witness puts Volkin near the alley last night. So it all connects? Whatever he did to that guy in the alley... Something happened to him while he was in the joint. Let's go to Las Cruces and see what we can come up with. Yes, of course he was sedated, but he deceived us very well. What we didn't know is that he hadn't been taking his daily Ephemerol dose. How long? We estimate for four days. Four days without Ephemerol? My father went insane without it after three. Why wasn't somebody monitoring him more closely? We changed our procedure after the escape. We recorded this off the security monitor on the scanner ward. (static crackles) (Karl screaming) - Hey! Hey! Goddamn it, can't you hear this guy down here? (Karl screaming) Hey, I can't listen to this anymore! (Karl screaming) Are you gonna take care of this guy? Shut up, Volkin! (club banging) Shut up, I said! Marino, gimme a hand with the freak, will ya? (Karl screaming) - Yeah, I'll be right there. (Karl screaming) Just exactly what the fuck is your problem, anyway? (tense music) (guard screams) Hey, Burt, you okay? What the? (Karl grumbling) (Marino grunting) (inmate screaming) (glass breaking) (tense music continues) (gun fires) Shit. (Karl grumbling) (static crackles) We lost those two guards and two more outside. What happened in the other guy's cell? He was a scanner, too, wasn't he? Strangest thing. He was burnt to a crisp and we don't know what happened. [Jim] Just like our guy in the alley. It's Volkin. We have four dead guards, one dead scanner, and one escaped prisoner. This has not been a good week. It's only Wednesday. (nurses chattering) You're outta bed. Yeah, doctor gave me a clean bill of health. I feel fine. Listen, I need your help. Volkin's killing scanners and I don't know why. Come with me to the center. Carry that. [Nurse] Dr. Fonzi to the delivery room. One of the scanners at the institution was killed. The remains of the deceased were unbelievable. Same with the guy in the alley. They were both killed the same way. Look at these. I'm just trying to put it all together to see where it connects. On one hand, it's simple. He wants to kill me. But on the other, why is he attacking other scanners? We know he's not taking Ephemerol. It's not just that, there's gotta be something more. Sam, before he scanned me, he said he felt hungry, and then, well, I don't know. I can't describe it, but I do know that it was new for Volkin, too. Maybe whatever happened to the scanner at Las Cruces was an accident. Maybe he just got caught in Volkin's crossfire. And I know I've seen something like this before. The question is where? (door squeaks) I'm sure I can find it if you can just give me a little more time. Okay, well, I've got a staff meeting back at the department, so after the meeting why don't I give you a call and we'll get together? I'll be right here. [Sam] Thanks. Oh, Sam! It's your copy of the information about your mother. I guess it'll have to just wait. Listen, it's okay not to know how to react to something like this. Yeah, I know. Just have to finish this case first. Besides, I still haven't figured out what I'm gonna say to somebody I haven't seen in 25 years. If you come up with anything, let me know. Take care of her. [Officer] You got it. (static crackling) This is a tape that I picked up today at the Los Cruces Psychiatric Institute. I want all of you to fully comprehend what we're up against here. (static crackles) Hey! (Karl screaming) Hey! Goddamn it, can't you hear this guy down here? (soft ominous music) (door clicks) [Girl] Mom, I'm home! Mom? [Karl] Hi ya, sweetheart. You come to party? [Girl] My God, where's my mother? - Hey, where you going? - Get away from me! - Come back here, huh? - Leave me alone! - Come on in and party. - No! - Come on. - Mom! Oh my God, Mom! - Your turn, little girl. (Craig laughing) No! No! (whimpering) Cuttin' in. All yours, big brother. (hand smacks) (Craig laughing) Now, we're gonna play nice. (girl screams) - Hey, ya like that, huh? [Karl] You want it again? What do you think, little brother, does she want it again? Shut up, you bitch! [Craig] Save some for me, huh? [Karl] What, huh? You like it? [Girl] No! [Sam] What's the ETAon backup? [Dispatcher] Your back up ETA is three minutes. I can't wait. I'm goin' in now. Freeze! Huh? (girl screams) (tense music) (girl whimpering) Scanner. Craig! (Craig chuckles) [Craig] What do ya think, cop, huh? (chuckles) No! (whimpering) Drop the knife. - Nah. - Take a hike, cop. (gun cocks) You heard him. Get outta here or she's dead! (girl screams) What, are you fuckin' deaf, huh? Huh? I mean it! Get outta here! Get outta here! I'm serious! (dramatic music) Karl, what the fuck? (gun fires) (girl screams) [Karl] Craigy! (Karl cries out) (girl crying) Up against the wall. I'm gonna kill you. Kill you so bad. Yeah right. (soft ominous music) [Karl] I'm gonna kill you. Kill you so bad. (gun fires) (Karl grumbling) You okay? Yeah. (soft ominous music) This is for you. Oh, thanks. What happened to these guys? That's the big question, and I am going nuts trying to find out. Is this what he tried to do to you? I don't know, Glory. Maybe. Didn't something like this happen back in the early '80s in Toronto? The Isis report. - Yes. - I think that's it. Where's their number? Here. (machine rumbling) (tense music) Having you will be so much better if you don't take the Ephemerol. (woman gasps) (woman cries out) No! Why? Why? Because. (tense music continues) (woman groaning) He came outta that room. I never rented that room. He was standing here acting weird. I never rented the room. (tense music) (woman groaning) We'll look around, but chances are this guy's already left. (woman screams) Wait right here. I never rented the room. (suspenseful music) (tense music) (woman groaning) Yes! (body sizzling) Oh, good. Good. Very good. But not enough for Staziak, not yet. Looks like plenty to me, pal. (Karl screams) (glass breaks) (dramatic music) (soft suspenseful music) What's goin' on? I don't know. I'm goin' in. (body thuds) (officer grunts) (tense music) (officer grunting) (doors bang) (static crackles) Get up. Prior to my putting Volkin in prison, he and his brother had murdered two people and were suspect in several other homicides. He's a killer. And he's a scanner who's developed powers that we don't quite understand yet. Mullins here will give you the assignments. All right, we're checking the scanner community, known acquaintances, hotels, arrest reports from all divisions, out of town departments, and the hospitals. Commander Trenton here will give you the breakdown of what we need from each department. Good luck to all of us. Sam, Mully. [Officer] We gotta start canvassing for witnesses to last night's occurrence downtown. (soft suspenseful music) Call 911 again. Tell them there's an officer down. (elevator dings) (suspenseful music) Danny, where the hell is he? (gun firing) (dramatic music) (siren blaring) Go! [Officer] Aw, geez. Sarg, who did this? (gun firing) (tense music) Reload. (tense music continues) Where's the back door? (siren blaring) (tense music continues) (siren blaring) (gun firing) (metal scraping) (tense music crescendos) (body thuds) (metal crunching) (soft ominous music) Jesus, I heard the crash. What the hell happened? (soft tense music) [Officer] And there's a civilian victim in the basement. You should see what she looks like, burned by chemicals or something. Copy that. It's him. (siren blaring) I heard the crash, I walk outside, and this guy is just walkin' that way. Well, I guess they went thatta way, didn't they? (soft suspenseful music) (soft tense music) (soft suspenseful music) (forklift whirring) Have you seen a tall guy with a long black jacket come through here? Naw, nobody. (soft suspenseful music) (soft tense music) I'm lookin' for a guy come runnin' through here, about 6-3, long black jacket. Nobody here like that. (tense music) Nothin'. Mighta come through really quick. I haven't seen a thing. - The other guy- - Geez! [Sam] Look out! (Sam grunts) (tense music) (Sam groans) (forklift whirring) (Sam grunting) [Karl] Crush the cop. Crush him. (tense music) [Sam] Release the lever. Release the lever. [Karl] Crush the cop. Do as I say. [Sam] No, don't. Stop the machine. Stop the machine. Release. - Crush him. - Release it. - Do it. [Sam] Stop the machine. [Karl] You're gonna kill him, Staziak. Do you want him to die? We're gonna kill him. (Sam grunts) (forklift whirring) (electricity zapping) (Sam groans) (soft ominous music) Volkin! [Karl] Up here, Sam. (gun firing) (electricity zaps) (straps snapping) (dramatic music) (pipes crash) (Sam grunting) (soft suspenseful music) Fuck! (soft tense music) I need more. (computer beeping) Turn at the next light. We were close. Detective, we need a statement about the massacre. How'd you get past the desk? No comment. When can we interview you regarding this? No comment. How long have you known about this killer and why hasn't the public been informed? (tense music) (camera zaps) I believe he said no comment. I shoulda had him! Nobody's blamin' you for what Volkin's doin', Sam. Don't blame yourself. The guy just keeps getting stronger and stronger and I don't know how he's doin' it. What about your expert? I haven't talked to her since earlier this afternoon. I'm sure she would have called if she had anything. Ya haven't slept in at least 36 hours. Maybe you oughta take a few hours rest. (chuckles) Yeah. Take my advice, Sam, take a break. I need you thinkin' straight. I'm thinkin' straight and I'm thinkin' I gotta get this guy. I'll be fine. All right. Is there anything else we could be doing? Short of me standing in the middle of the street waitin' for him to come and get me, no. (phone ringing) Yeah? Oh, hi, Carrie. Yeah, hold on. Sam, it's Carrie. Hi. Tell me ya have somethin'. I faxed a think tank in Canada and they sent me back something you have to see. There's a restaurant called Pedro's on Olympic and 5th. Meet me there in 20 minutes. So you're askin' me to dinner. Yes, but you're picking up the tab. I can do that. Goodbye. (soft suspenseful music) (alarm buttons beeping) Olympic and 5th. (soft ominous music) (alarm buttons beeping) (computer beeping) (tense music) (printer whirring) (soft ominous music) Fucking perfect. Here it is. In the early '80s, two scanners got into a quarrel at a resource center in Toronto. That's all that was left of the loser. The winner went on to kill another scanner in the exact same way. He said he needed their essence to increase his power. I think this is what's happening here. (soft ominous music) [Karl] Ah, Denise. First on the list. (soft ominous music continues) (doorbell rings) [Denise] I'll get it, hon! (tense music) (Denise whimpering) Volkin is gaining strength from the scanners he's killing and he's only growing more delusional by the hour without his Ephemerol. Whoa, whoa, wait, slow down. Are you saying that he's sucking the life force out of the scanners he's killing for power? Like a vampire feeding on blood? Denise? Denise, what the... (body sizzling) (ominous music) (husband screaming) (utensil clatters) Thank you, sir. That is so beautiful. Thanks. Belonged to my mother. I've been wearing it ever since I decided to look for her. That's nice. Thanks. Excuse me, Detective. We just found another victim with the same MO. What's up? Volkin just killed another scanner. I gotta go. Sam, he may be more powerful than you at this point. I'll be careful. You, too. (soft ominous music) Glory hallelujah. (soldering iron zapping) (soft suspenseful music) (soldering iron zapping) (Glory gasps) Jesus, honey! J.J.! Don't sneak up on me like that. Well, where ya been all day, huh? I left you messages all day long. You haven't returned one of my calls. What's goin' on around here? J.J., I've been workin'. I'm sorry, baby. Come here. Give me a hug. Come on. Hi, baby. Hi. (scoffs) So, what do you call this one? What is it? What is it supposed to be, huh? What are you? (soft ominous music) This is a private studio. Oh, that's all right. What I want is also private. Her.

(soft ominous music) Sorry, sir, it's a little late for visiting hour... Rachel Staziak. She should be in the rec room about now. You're welcome, sir. You win all the time. (chuckles) No, I don't. He's my son. [Man In Robe] Good evening, ladies. (women chattering) (officers chattering) Carrie? They couldn't identify her or her boyfriend, so they called me because my name's in her purse an emergency contact. Sam, Glory only moved here a week ago. The only way he could get this address is from the center. He's got a list of the scanners. And if you don't stop him, he's gonna kill all of us. No. No. (soft ominous music) [Woman On Phone] Are you there? Bob? Bob, are ya there? (phone dialing) Hey there. Odgen, forensics comes through the backstairs. What time did the call come in? (phone ringing) Is that you, Sam? Yes, of course it is. Put a trace on this call, Mike. Yeah, I'm here. Did you know you were born exactly at midnight and they didn't know whether your birthday was on the 6th or the 7th of May? She's really quite attractive, Sam. Too bad you won't be able to see it after I'm done with her. Adios, fucker. See ya soon. (tense music) (Sam groans) Sam, what is it? He's got my mother. Dear, is something wrong? (ominous music) Well, my goodness. She always was an odd duck. (dial tone humming) (phone dialing) - What are you doing? (phone ringing) (tense music) St. Jude Retirement Home. Hello? (suspenseful music) Sam, you know this is a trap. I know, but he's holding all the cards. You don't understand, Sam. You've gotta create an illusion if you're going to stop him. All right, just get in. Explain it to me on the way. (suspenseful music) (Rachel gasps) [Resident] Hey, what are you doing up here? Well, hello. How are you? (resident screams) (Rachel whimpers) (Rachel gasps) (suspenseful music) [Carrie] Volkin's grown more powerful, but he's also fallen into dementia and you can use that against him. Play with his mind. (Rachel gasps) (soft suspenseful music) (door handles clicking) (fingernails scraping) (footsteps receding) (soft suspenseful music) (Rachel gasps) The only thing better than taking you will be taking him. (tense music) (Rachel grunting) (siren blaring) I won't let you use me to harm my son. No! (body thuds) (siren blaring) Ah, Sam. (siren blaring) Hey, Staziak! Come on up! Unless you've got some more friends or family members you'd like to send my way. I'm waiting for you, scanner cop! (officers chattering) Establish a perimeter. Sam, create an illusion. It's the only way you can stop him. [Officer] Harrison, take the west side of the building! (suspenseful music) [Officer On Radio] 10-4 to acknowledge. (static crackles) (officer chattering) (suspenseful music) Woo-woo! This way, old pal. (soft ominous music) Sam! Slow down. How do you expect me to back you up? I don't. (electricity zapping) (doors slamming) Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'. (soft suspenseful music) Get some help, all right? Hey, who are you? (tense music) (body thuds) Harv, what's with all the fire doors? I was doing my rounds when all of a sudden... Holy Toledo, Harv. What happened? Hey! What the hell do you think you're doin'? (tense music) (guard grunting) Nighty-night. Hmm. (soft suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) Hi ya, Sam. Long time no see. Fuck you. (gun clatters) How ya been? (tense music) That tickles. And you're pathetic. Ba-boom! (wood clattering) (men grunting) Listen, radio for the fire department. Get us some equipment down here. (Sam cries out) Beep beep. (tense music) That's better, Sam. (Sam screams) (head thuds) - Oh. Don't know my own strength. [Carrie] Create an illusion. Create an illusion. Dementia, Volkin's fallen into dementia and you can use that against him. Play with his mind. It's the only way you can stop him. I'm gonna take my time with you, scanner cop! (soft suspenseful music) (tense music) Here. Break off, guys, break off. Guys, get me this door open. - Step aside. Get it open now. - I got it. - Go, go. (tense music) How do you feel, Sam? Well, it only gets worse. (tense music) (Sam grunts) (tense music) (Sam groaning) (officer screams) Fooled ya, didn't I, Karl? (soft tense music) Wanna try again? (tense music) What's wrong, Karl? (tense music intensifies) (Sam groaning) (janitor and Karl grunting) Wretched cop bastard! (suspenseful music) Staziak! Wasted your strength scanning me, Karl. Sorry, I haven't been myself lately. It's the real me. Did you enjoy meeting your mom, Sammy boy? Yeah. (tongue clicks) You're a real funny guy, Karl. Ya know, I've waited a long time for this. I'm sure you have. (Karl screeches) (tense music) (Sam grunting) (Sam shouts) (tense music) (Karl groaning) (Sam screams) (body thuds) (Karl grunts) I don't think you've got the strength to kill me, Staziak! Think again. (tense music) (Karl groaning) (tense music) (tense music crescendos) (Karl screams) (explosion booms) (Sam panting) (soft ominous music) (dramatic music) [Firefighter] That's it, it's comin'. Go, go. (firefighter grunts) Volkin? He won't be available for questioning. You all right, Sam? Better now. [Jack] Marty, get backup on the air, okay? Clear. (officers chattering) - Let's go home. - Hey, Joey, Franklin. Inside, make a sweep, okay. [Officer] One of you got the paperwork on ya? (suspenseful music) (soft ominous music) (ominous music) (ominous music) (upbeat funk music)
