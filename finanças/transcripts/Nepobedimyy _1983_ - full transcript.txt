Dedicated to Anatoly Arkadievich Kharlampiev It all happened in 1928. Thank you for your support, Comrade Podvolsky. Your word was decisive. Yes, but I didn't understood what fight you have invented. I did not invent anything - other people invented it before me. I see... agitating again? OK explain, why the Red Army needs your martial art? It wouldn't survive without it? Try to understand, Nikolai Ilyich. In our army, the agility and the intellect must overcome brute force. - When are you leaving? - Tonight. First, to the Caucasus, then to Central Asia. Well... What to do with you? I don't want to let go of course but... Go. But... as you know, the situation is a bit complicated there. I cannot guarantee your safety. A film by Andrei Rostotsky UNBEATABLE Scriptwriter: Pavel Lungin Director: Yuri Boretsky Operator: Michael Goyhberg Composer: Evgeni Ptichkin Senior Consultant: Honored Master of Sports of the USSR A. Kolesov I can't do it anymore, I'm going to fall. You cannot die - you're the last man in the family! Grandpa, why didn't you gave the manuscript to Jafar? Shut up! Tamerlane himself - King of Kings was afraid of our ancestors. All the same, we will die. You must help him first! Yes... the guys have done it properly. Hurry on! If one of you had fallen, this could be the end! Who did this to you? - Jafar. - Shut up! Grandpa! They didn't catch the camel! Well done! It's returned. - Come on. - What is your name? - Khromov, and you? - Yulchi. - Well, let's go! - I cannot. We cannot live without that camel! Yulchi's legs were paralysed when they killed his father. My son. Grandfather will cure me in the mountains! You talk too much! Yulchi, do you have friends other than camels? None. It is better not to love people. - Why not? - They die. This is how I travel around the world. Learning different fighting techniques, looking for ancient manuscripts in which they are described. By the way, dear Fatakhbeck, do you know the manuscript called "Kalsanaty"? - Grandfather... - No. No, never heard of it, dear. Good morning! As Salam Aleykum! - Where's Khromov? - Where? He is far away. Hey, girl! Where's the village council? There. - Salam Aleykum, Chairman! - Aleykum Salam. - Do you like it? - Very... And what does it say? Down with the paranja - the mask of hypocrisy! - Is it your idea? - Yes. Convincing. And where is the home of Master Juma? Our Juma? Over there, on the mountain. Want to learn Kurash? - There will be problems - come. - What? He is no ordinary man... You'll see. - But he is a great master. - Well, see for yourself. - See you soon. - Good luck. So come, Guest! - Hello, Ustos! - Why are you here? I heard, that you are famous for your knowledge of ancient fighting techniques. I would like to learn from you. - Are you a Russian? - Yes. From the Volga. Don't break your glasses! I can take them off when it's necessary. Well, let's go. Father is back! Well, come to me! Why do you need, our Kurash? I'm interested not only in the Kurash. I also studied Chadaoba in the Caucasus. Gushtinyu from Tajiks. And now I have come to learn from you. Sit down. Where can I find the best teacher? Take it to the guest. His name is Roly-Poly. And yours? Juma. Here! Take it. Here we are teaching in a different way. When a father brings his son to the mullah, he says: "Master, teach him, beat him. "The meat is yours but the bones are ours." Your meat, Master. Take care of business. Take the cauldron, take it to the river, wash it and bring it back here. It will be done, Master. Sorry, friend. Move a side. OK, show me the way, little Juma. It looks like Khan's retinue. Hey, careful, I'm going to fall! Well, it fell. I wonder... did they washed it anyway? - Could you get me a bunch of twigs? - Yeah, right away. And you - give me some sand from the shore. Good boy. Good job! Well, That's another matter! - Leila, come with us! - No, no, no, go alone! Thank you, little Juma. I couldn't do it without your help! - What's this? - Oh! Well... Let's go home. Uh, wait, wait, wait. Look. Grab him here and throw! All right. Excellent. So. Now you try it. Grab him firmly! Hey, rookie! I'm talking to you. Are you deaf or what? Bring me some tea - I'm thirsty! Dear Abdullah, I did not understand what kind of tea - black or green? I told you, green! Are you mocking me? Oh! Sari surun! Asharikift! But this, Abdullah, you do not know. Just don't tell this to anyone - they would laugh on you! - And would you teach me this? - I will teach you. Give me your hand. Where are you swimming? This throw has shown me one good man - the old master. Okay. Come back tomorrow, early. Phew! Okay. Enough. Enough for today. You play with dolls? This is my main teacher - Roly-Poly. You push him down, and yet he always stands up. What do you always write in the notebook? Poetry? These are much more important for me now than poetry. And why is it so important? Once I saw when a peaceful demonstration of unarmed students were attacked by the Black Hundreds, monarchists. Bandits. Bandits beat them with sticks, knives... and knuckles. They were deliberately beaten with skill - to death. And students could not do anything. They were beautiful, intelligent, they knew how to argue, but you know... ...they did not know how to fight. On that day, they killed my brother. He wrote poetry. Smart... good people should be able to defend themselves. They need to be taught how to. And you think you know all the moves of Kurash? Almost. - Are you sure? - I am sure. - Are you not lying? - No. I am not. Come on, get up. Let's see what you can do! - Do not be afraid! Come on! - Well, let's go then. Impressive! Did you hurt yourself? You know.., every nation has its own Kurash, its own martial art. I want to collect the best techniques and combine them. To become the most powerful of all? No, to be able to teach others. The weak - how to protect themselves from evil. The unarmed - from the armed. You're a strange man Khromov. You don't write poetry, yet still you talk like a poet. But you deliberately let yourself to be beaten - dodger! Ustos Juma, the next week Yakub Khan organises a wrestling championship. Allah gave him a son! Come to Saylik with your fighters to compete! Will see who's better. Yakub Khan will reward the winner with a richly embroidered robe. - My fighters will be there. - Hop! Heye! Sari surun! Kambash! Asharikift. Tuyachil. Repeat. Guest! Well guest, show us what you've got! Begin! Andrei, you'll come with us to the competition. Here we go! Good luck! Good luck! - It is chilly today. - You thought it is always hot around here? Where did you serve? In the special regiment fighting against robber bandits. We destroyed Jafar's gang, and now I'm going home. - Farhad. - Andrei. Uncle! Bless Tokhtasyn. Ustos, bless me! Amen. So help you Allah! Amen! - Tokhtasyn is a strong fighter! - Abdullah wins. Start! - Abdullah, give it to him! - Tokhtasyn, come on! Come on, Abdullah! The winner is the student of Ustos Juma, Abdullah! Dagger of Akbar the great wrestler! Oh! Yeah, that's a gift! Bless him, uncle! - Allah Akbar! - Amen! Begin! - Abdullah come on! - Karim! - Karim, do not fear him! - Show him! - Get him! - Come on, come on! Allah will send you a long life! He broke his arm! Karim won! This is unworthy of the noble Art of Kurash! Ustos Juma, fight is like the real life - where always the strongest wins! - I'll fight! - I'll go! - Who is this? - My disciple. He's Russian. Do you authorize it, Ustos? Whoever wins will get an embroidered robe. And can I try it on? Try it on, while you still can! I add a camel to your robe! Everyone knew my Sabrali. - Yes, everyone knows her. - Of course, we do! Be careful - he fights dirty. Do you remember everything? Here you go. Begin, begin! - Hooray! - Throwing does not count! Why not? Why, why... You shouldn't touch the ground with your knees. Keep going! Come on, Russian, come on! Hold on! At least you didn't break your hands! The second throw was strong... Very strong... I'll hammer him in the ground! Come on, Yakub Khan is waiting! He fights fair! Karim Haidar! Haidar, come out! Great Haydar Karim against the Russian! Closer, a puppy! Closer! Dear, come to fight! Sheikh Jafar, the old man has vanished into thin air! You've lost him again, you dog! Now we go to the mountain and you're looking for the old man. If you do not find him, I'll kill you. Go. You know how the people call you? "The Unbeatable!" So what, am I invincible then? Come to our village - I will treat you as my brother! I'll make you a pilaf! It's beautiful there! Ask for the Red Farhad, everyone knows me! See you there! - Well, have a nice trip Unbeatable. - Thank you, Ustos. You were a good teacher! You've learned all that I know. And remember, Andrei, the life of a man is short but true knowledge - has no limits. This Russian ruined my holiday. My son was born, and there were no fighters in my family. Now... everyone will laugh at me! Nobody will laugh at you. Hey, Unbeatable! Yakub Khan sends you a gift! You wanted to try it? Here you are! Thank you. Hop! Go to uncle and tell him that no one will laugh at him. Hey! Hey! Who's this with you? I caught a thief. Give him to me. I'm in a hurry! Out of my way! I don't want to disrespect your age! The Notebook! The Notebook! Shut up. In his words go life and strength. Here, drink this. Grandpa found a notebook. And I found the bag. - The wolf came again. - How many killed? Six. Look at him - cold dead. Both of you are sick. Life - is movement! If you will just lie like this ram - you will die. In the meadow there are many stones. Collect them! Grandpa! Look how many stones we collected! Not enough! Come to me. Today I drive the flock to the mountains. Take a stone. And you take a stone, too. That's better. Come with me. Ustos here too good grass! Why go up so high? Beauty is understandable for animals. I lead the sheep to the most beautiful places of our mountains. People come for a hundred miles afar, just to buy my sheep! Tired. Wolf! Here, drink this. Thanks, I am already healthy! Well, well... Andrei! When you were on the tournament, you showed some skills in the fight, but you do not know what is mastery without a fight. Let's go! Come here! Closer. Closer. Look down. Your greatest enemy is fear. The fear that lives in every person. Mastery knows no fear. Get up. Come on. When you'll beat yourself - you'll gain new unknown forces! Jump! Everything you've been taught before - is just the external side of the fighting skills. Jump! Does it hurt? Learn to forget - the sword in front of you, just as the thorns - whether you face a weak or a strong opponent! Jump! So, you want to create the perfect fighting style and give it to the people? Yes, Ustos. And are you not afraid that you will give your people a terrible gift? A gift that is like the snake's poison, which can heal, but can also kill? No one knows where the path of knowledge leads. I do not understand, Ustos. - Does it still hurt? - Yes, in the evenings. - And now - it hurts less, right? - Yes... I could even kill you with such a light touch. Kill me? Well, yes... And this can be taught to some villain, too... or to some madman! My knowledge is dangerous. So what? So you still want to learn it? - Well? - I do not know... That's why some sages live far away in the mountains, alone. Sages eventually come down from the mountains searching for students. Knowledge should not be buried with them when they die. It is too far away to waste a bullet on. Khromov, if a wolf is evil, it should be punished. Is that right? Of course it is. In nature there are no such things as good or evil. Tell me, where was the evil until people came up with the idea of good? My father was killed by evil people! And Khromov was almost killed by evil man. I will be strong and will deal with them! Go to sleep. I will watch the sheep. Khromov! Khromov! This is it. Run faster, faster! You're looking for "Kalsanaty"? Here it is. This Tibetan manuscript was given to me by my teacher. Whoever studies it, will become a great healer or the greatest killer. Jafar murdered your father Yulchi for this scroll. I am an old man. This knowledge is already a burden for me. You took it. Now it's your burden. Yulchi, Khromov will be a good teacher for you. Remember your father's murderer! Beware of him! He is a terrible person. If he hears about the manuscript, he will try to destroy you. Khromov, I gave you everything. Now, you are the master. - He followed us! - Who? Look to the left. Some guy. I saw him yesterday. And all day today he was following us. I think I know him. Of course I know him! Why are you following us? Go home. He is still following us!! He is coming! And Fatakhbeck's puppy is with him! Greetings, unbeaten fighter! You're mistaking me with someone else. The news of your miraculous healing have reached our village Lyakum. Lyakum... My friend, Red Farhad lives there! He invites you to our village for a big tournament of Kurash. Many masters of the ancient techniques will be there. They will show you things you have not seen yet. - And is this place far from here? - I'll show you! Look, a bird! You're like a girl! I'm a girl. Are you crazy? Walking around in the city wearing men's clothes! - Yes, you know what... - I know. I'm a disgrace to the family. - And are you not afraid? - Of course I'm afraid! Welcome to Lyakum! - Where can I find the Red Farhad? - He disappeared. We're looking for him. Enough talk, Asman! Take the young men to his house, to take a rest from the road. And we, dear, let's go to the Chairman. Yulchi! This way. - This is our chairman - Sheikh... - No sheikhs! Just call me "comrade". Comrade Murvale. - I'm Khromov. - Khromov? As Salam Aleykum! That very same Khromov? Glad to see you in good health. Welcome to our village. You are our honoured guest. I was also interested in ancient fighting methods once. - Getting ready for the holiday? - No. This is our group of self-defence. Village guards. There are some bandits in the mountains. We must be on alert! Move, move! - What have you got in the bag? - Nothing. Just things! I'll check it out. Go, go, go! Oh, who returned to us! Farhad! Well, Red Farhad, you are back? To the square! Go! - What a strange village. - Uh-huh. The order is executed. Farhad is caught. I'll leave you for a while. Ahmadjan! - Entertain the guest. Bring some tea. - Yes, sir. Would you like some more tea, Comrade Khromov? No, thank you. Can we play something? What? There is a Russian game - called "Bug". I can teach you. Muslims! Muslims... ...the villain shed blood of the defenders of Islam! He is a servant to the white-eared, their faithful dog! He abused the Shariah! He wanted to run, but nobody can escape his own fate! No one will escape the hands of justice! No one! But I am merciful, and will spare you. I'll spare him for you. Because you are deceived. Do you regret your actions? Brothers! Brothers! Do not be afraid of those scoundrels! Today or tomorrow our squad will come and save us. Do you see, how deluded is this man? Each disease is treated by its own medicine. Let this unfortunate be helped by our contempt! All those who love Sheikh Jafar follow his example! Brother, it is better to die than to endure such a disgrace! - Remove this crazy girl. - Go! He will talk tomorrow. They will kill my brother! - Stop crying. What is your name? - Zumrat. - Who are these people Zumrat? - Bandits. They came two nights ago. Killed every communist. Only my brother escaped. And their leader... I know him. He killed my father. His name is Jafar. Well, the competition will start tomorrow? Enough, Khromov. There will be no competition. Then let's talk frankly, Jafar. You guessed it. I like you. Very nice. I need the "Kalsanaty"! What "Kalsanaty"? Do not pretend to be an ass, Khromov. You are not convincing. Why do you seek death in a forsaken village like Lyakum? It is stupid. You're a scientist and collecting the tricks of martial arts. The scroll is not for you. This is the art of killing. Do you agree? No, this is the art of life! Life... Anarchy breaks out. The world order is violated, and in order to restore it, killing should be done without mercy. - Fear is a good medicine! - Medicine? But you yourself are afraid, Jafar! And no scrolls will save you from that. I could have been the one... - I need to think. - Think then. Think about it. And also consider the boys. They will suffer before they are killed. - Where are you going? - I will kill this man! Allah will forgive me! This kid will destroy us all. You were left in charge, and you...! We need to save Khromov. Zumrat where are they holding your brother? In the old smithy. What are you thinking? - Take off your clothes! - Eh? - Fast! Do not be afraid, I am not a man. My name is Leila. Look away! What are you looking at? - How much further? - Over there, behind the bridge. Your boys are in the house of Farhad. - What are you doing here? - I brought dinner for my brother. Your brother does not need more food anymore! Leave it here! - Khromov! Khromov, are you there? - He is with Jafar. Untie me! To Jafar! Keep your rifle! Let's go! Wait for us here. Take the bag, there is a scroll in it. I am alone. He killed my father! I myself, I myself... In such cases don't hurry! - Who was that? - I don't know! They started fighting... Bring him back! Take him alive! How many bandits are in the village? Now count! Two less! Jafar ordered to bring him back alive! I'll tie you for your own good! - Get him! - Try it! Go away, Yulchi! I'll distract them! I am in a hurry, guys! Where to? You came to us to compete! By what rules will you fight? We have no rules! Oh, guys, guys... Aki! Yason! Kill him, Yason! The Russian is killed! Come on! Get out! Get out! Come out, people of the village Lyakum! Get out! Get out! People are being killed before your eyes, and you just sit. Khromov is killed, and you, you... Nice speech! Do not be afraid of him! He is an ordinary murderer. And he's afraid of you. Forget what she said! She is insane! Murderer! Out of the way! Out of the way! Go! Khromov? Get out! Out of my way! Get out! Khromov! Khromov! Khromov! That's it! "Sambo" - what does it mean? Self-defence without weapons, comrade Podvolsky. Ivan Vasilievich, please start! - Begin. - Yes! I'm ready. Do not joke - our lads are serious. Ermakov, strike that citizen! I can kill him. Pretend that he was your class enemy. - I'll do it! - Come on. Please. Something like that. - Well done! - Very good! Here you go. We take it to the service. "Every man is endowed with a major reservoir of creativity, but most people sleep soundly. To awaken the forces - is our most important task. " Anatoly Kharlampiev THE END
