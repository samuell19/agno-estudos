[RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYS, DISTANT CROWD TALKING] [MAN] Aghh! You work real hard now and show them they picked the right man for the job. See that maybe you write often and calls us once in a while, will you? I will, Ma. You know, if this transfer doesn't affect my vacation we'll be back in a couple of months anyway. Maybe sooner if I goof off. You won't goof off. [HONKING] That must be the taxi. It's here, Cliff. I'll get those. If you don't watch it, you're gonna be flat down on your back again. - Bye mother! - Bye darling! - Bye Daddy. - Bye. Well, you'll hear from us soon. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye, Mama. Goodbye. Take care. Come on, Mom. She's been with us a long time. We've been lucky. She's got to spread her own wings. Cliff. Rick, damn it's good to see you. Hey, you're looking good. Hey Rick, I want you to meet my wife Mindy. - Mindy, Rick Walcott. - Mindy. How are you, Mindy? Rick's chief engineer at the LA plant. He's the one that's gonna work with me for a while. I'm your boy. Say, I hope you like our little city here. I knew we'd get this guy sooner or later. Just a matter of time. Would you care for a drink before we head out? Thanks Rick, but I'd like to see the apartment. I'm awfully anxious to get home. Well then, come on. I have a car parked right outside here. Let me give you a hand. Damn, it's good to see you. Well, I'm not much of hunting apartments so I hope you kids like it. Everything's furnished but the food. Well, if Mindy likes it I guess I can take anything. It looks great to me. Can we go see first and then get our things? Sure can. Cliff, before I forget, let me give you something here. There's a key to the apartment, and this one's for your wheels over here. Yeah? Looks brand new. Is it, Rick? It sure is. Nothing but the best for the top man on the Grand Rapids. And the model gets longer the better you do. Oh hun, I can't wait to see the apartment. Let's go. Hey, it's not bad. Oh, I like it. It's real nice, Rick. Well, for the price you get everything you need. Hey, I do like it here already. Maybe I should have taken this place myself just to get next to that. It's all right, Rick. I can handle that. Oh, baby, baby. You oughta see the doll we saw walking into the apartment across the hall. Leave it to you two not to miss a thing. Oh, but this was something. Sure wish I could make some coffee or something. We'll have to get to a store right away so we can get groceries. Coffee, schmoffee. I think we oughta have that drink now. I agree. They don't expect you in the office till tomorrow morning anyway. So why not? Why not? Hey, I saw a liquor deli on the way up here. Why don't we go out and bring something back? Wouldn't you rather go to a bar or a club? I'll just stay here, if you don't mind. That way I can start putting things away and keeping house. Would you like something else? A sandwich or something? Oh no, they fed us pretty well on the plane. You need any money, honey? Ah, no I got enough. [WOMAN] Hi. Can I give you a hand? You sure could. Boy, I can remember the day when this happened to me. I'm only glad it didn't happen out in the street. [WOMAN LAUGHS] I'm Joanie Willis. I just live across the hall from you. - Looks like we'll be neighbors. - Oh! Well, it might be nice to have friendly neighbors for a change. I'm Mindy Newhall. Nice to know you, Joanie. Tell me Mindy, are you new here or are you just changing apartments? Oh no, we're new here. My husband got promoted. Oh really, what does he do? He's with Metal Crafters. They make airplane parts and aircrafts, and oh, I don't know. You'll have to drop down sometime for a drink when you get settled. We will, real soon. It's a friendly little club. I'm sure you'll love it. Oh, do you have to go? I should, really. I've got a few things I've gotta wash up before I go to work. - Well, thanks again for the hand. - Sure. Drop over anytime now, Mindy. Bye bye, now. Hey, have we got the right apartment? Lock the door, Rick. Don't let this one get away. Oh, Joanie meet my husband, Cliff. Hello Joanie. You're just in time to have a drink with us. Meet Rick. Hello Joanie. By the way, are you married? Married? Fellas, it's been nice meeting you. Really, I do have to run. I should go home and wash up a few things... Oh, no no no. You gotta have one little drink with us. I can't, really. No excuses. Sit. Sure, you're just in time to help us celebrate our first day in L.A. Get some glasses, will you? Come on, honey. Set that down and relax for a while. I'd rather have it dripping on the box than on the coffee table. Oh, you little darling. I'm kind of glad I brought you along. You're gonna turn out to be handy after all. For what? Hey, cool it you two. You're giving me a lot of ideas. Like asking Joanie here a lot of personal questions. Like, you wanna get married maybe? Thanks, but no thanks. This kid's got some kicks coming before the big hitch. Sounds interesting. Tell me about it. Really, I must leave. As much as I enjoy your company. Tanya just doesn't take to us girls being late. And I don't wanna disappoint her. Well, you never can tell, Joanie. We might drop in before the night's out. Where'd you say that place was again? You got three blocks down to Kester Street, make a right, a couple of doors, and there you are. You can't miss it. Real nice meeting you Joanie. And thanks again. Oh, thanks for nothing. Thank you for the drink. Maybe we'll see you all later. You make it sound so inviting, who knows? We may beat you there. Drop over again anytime. You're welcome. Sure Joanie. You don't need a special invite. Come by anytime. Thank you. I hope you'll let me return the hospitality. Bye bye, now. That, my dear girl, will spin any man's ears. So don't blame him. Oh, don't go. Sue's probably burning by now. So, many thanks and I'll see you in the office in the morning. Okay, Cliff? Hey, you've been holding out on us. Now who's Sue? Get ol' stud here. He's got it all wrong. She's the greatest little office helper we've had in years. Not only can she run an office, but she's kind of nice to have around. You'll meet her in the morning. Thanks again, Mindy. See you again real soon, I hope. Thanks for the help on the apartment hunting. - Come back again. - Okay. Uh listen, if you and your Sue are out running around later on, why don't you stop by that place where Joanie works? We'll probably go down later and see what it looks like. You mean Tanya's place? Well, don't count on it, but we'll see how the evening goes. Bye now. Cliff, what are you looking at? Keep the door shut while I'm changing. Boy, am I gonna like living here. I wanna get into something more relaxing. [JOANIE] I didn't hear you knock. [RICK] I didn't knock. [JOANIE] Do you make it a habit of walking into every girl's apartment without an invitation? [RICK] Baby, the way you tossed around that equipment of yours was invitation enough. [JOANIE] Pretty fresh. I should ask you to leave. [RICK] You're right. I am fresh. But, you won't ask me to leave. [RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYS] - Well hi! - Hi, Joanie. Gee, I'm glad to see you. How do you like the club? We love it, we love this. Hey, I like your costume too. You oughta wear that all the time. What would you like to have? Well, I could tell you what I'd like to have. Ow. I'll have a vodka martini. Scotch on the rocks. Okey-dokey. As soon as Tanya's free, I'll bring her right over to meet you. You've got rocks on your brain. You make me feel incompetent sometimes. Oh baby. Now, you know better than that. Mm-mmm. I like that. Why don't you learn to do that, honey? I might. Make it worth my while? Tanya, can you come with me for a minute? There's somebody I'd like you to meet. Hello. Cliff and Mindy, I want you to meet Tanya. Tanya, Cliff and Mindy Newhall. They're our friends across the hall. You know, the ones I was telling you about? Mindy, how nice to have you for a neighbor as well as a customer. I hope we can also be good friends. - And you too, Cliff. - Thank you. Only you're liable to see more of us around here than at the apartment. This is just my kind of a joint though. Real hip place. Enjoy yourselves. Would you join us for a drink? Oh, please do. I'd love to. It isn't every day that you can have drinks with charming friends. Joanie, why don't you bring Cliff and Mindy two Tanya's Grogs? Mm, I'm a scotch man myself. Try this, Cliff. I think you'll like it. Two grogs and one usual. Okey-doke, be right back. You both look rather gamesy to me. Well, we like our fun. I'm sure you do. Mindy, how do you like the new apartment? Oh, I love it. It'll sort of be like camping until we get all our things in. If you need any help, please feel free to call. Thank you. Joanie tells me that you're with a metal company. What do you do, Cliff? Well, I won't know till I check in in the morning. Okay everybody. Fasten your seatbelts, here we go. Oh, pretty. One for you. - And here's yours, Tanya. - Thank you. And yours is empty, isn't it? Have fun. Here's to friendship. May it be long and lasting. - Cheers. - Salud. Good God. I don't know what's in it, but it sure tastes good going down. It's good. What is in it, Tanya? I never tell. But I will tell you that after two it doesn't seem to make much difference. This is a great place you got here. Are you running it for someone? [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] No Cliff, it's my business. Well, it's good that you found a way to do it. How long have you been here? Oh honey, you ask too many kestions. My tongue is getting thick. I mean, questions. Well, come on sweetheart. I'm a friendly guy. Don't make such a big deal out of it. You're a friendly girl. So, I'll tell you what. I'll be friendly to you, - and you can be friendly to... - Lay off. If you both will excuse me, I will be back in a few minutes. Come on, sweetheart. That's no way to act. Show a little cooperation. I mean, after all - Aagh! Once is enough for that, mister. Oh... Aagh... Now just a damn minute, lady... [WOMAN] Can I be of any help? [MAN] Looks like you helped yourself already. That's twenty dollars! I think I'm worth it. Yeah? How can I find out? [WOMAN] Let's go to my place. I'll show you. All out. I'll go get you some. One of those grogs does that, what does three or four do? You better not find out. Light? How long have you been married, Mindy? Oh, almost a year. Will be the twentieth of next month. Do you like being married? Very much. Oh, we have our problems, but then what husband and wife doesn't? I didn't like being married. Found it rather boring. No variation. How long were you married? Long enough to know I didn't want a husband. I find I don't always need a man to give me what I want. As long as we're neighbors, we should become very close and good friends. There you go, Ma. Here you go, Mindy. Another drink from your gentleman friend here. Oh honey, You're not gonna... you're not gonna have a hangover on your first day on the job? One more of these is just enough to make you go beddy bye. I'll be ready for beddy bye, all right. The sleeping kind. Mindy, I think you better take this boy home and feed him. He looks hungry to me. And if you folks will excuse me, I have a call to make. Stop in the morning for coffee, Mindy. And much good luck on your job, Cliff. Thanks. You make a hell of a drink here. We'll be back. - Good night. - Good night. You're hungry, all right. I don't think you'll ever get enough of what you're hungry for. - Who, me? - Yeah. - Ouch! - Down boy. Drink up and let's go home. I'm ready for that nice soft bed. Atta girl. I'm with you. Sorry Tanya. I didn't mean to upset you. Smile, darling. - Cliff? - Mm? What do you think of Tanya? I don't know. What does that mean? I don't know. I mean, how does she affect you? You mean, would I like to make her? Well, would you? I don't know. From her, I don't know whether I'd be getting a kiss or a kick in the face. She certainly is different, all right. [CLOCK TICKING] [GROANING] [MAN BREATHING HEAVILY] Now, the overrides on that Condon deal, alone, well with that, we could... Well hell, what couldn't we do with more money? You just make it, darling. I'll know what to do with it. Do you know how long it's been since I bought something that wasn't a giveaway at a clearance sale? I wouldn't mind one bit picking out some clothes and not having to look at the price tag first. All right, if I get that Condon contract I will buy you a whole new wardrobe. - Is that a deal? - Deal. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Yes. Mr. Brenner? Well, come in Newhall. Welcome to Metal Crafters LA. How do you like our city? Well, I like what I've seen of it, Mr. Brenner. Uh, I've sort of acquired the name of D.G. around here. I've kind of gotten used to it, you may as well use it. - Thank you. - Sit down. Hell, we work too close together here for formalities. You all settled and ready for business? Yes, sir. Rick got us a nice apartment and delivered the car. - Good. - My wife's playing house and I'm ready to do my best for Metal Crafters. Good, good. That's what I like to hear. You know uh, you've got a hell of a chore cut out for you. Walton was our best man. And when his heart dropped in the hospital, he'd not only carved out our company's biggest year, but he also had negotiations well under way with enough manufacturers to establish our company as second to none in the business. He'll be a hard man to follow. Well, it's a damn shame to lose a man like that. The doctors feel pretty sure that he won't be any use to anyone from here on out. - I'm sorry to hear it. - Yeah. 20th century hazard. Man busts his guts to make it, and the gears of progress grind him to pulp in the process. But it's our way of life. You have to uh, you have to walk over the fallen and move on. So let's get to work, huh? Sue, bring Walton's Condon file in here, will you please? [SUE] Yes, sir. One moment please. Well uh, we might as well bring you up to date on everything that we've been doing. Has Rick uh, brought you up to date on the newest lightweight alloy that we've developed? Uh, not yet, sir. I know of it, but not about it. Here's the Walton file, Mr. Brenner. - I believe it's complete. - Thank you. Uh, Ms. Bryce, meet Mr. Newhall. This is Sue Bryce. Best girl Friday I ever had. Well, thank you Mr. Brenner. Very nice to meet you, Mr. Newhall, and welcome to Los Angeles. It's my pleasure. You know, I feel as though I've known you for a very long time because I've had to type your name on memos and office reports, Mr. Newhall. Just Cliff. Well thanks. Just Sue here, too. Cliff will be working out of this office until we can set him up in his own. Walton's secretary wants a few days to wrap up his paperwork and pile his notes, and so forth. Then you'll be taking over in there. Well, I won't distract you two any longer. I have xeroxed the reports in toto. If you want to do some homework, you can take them and check them over. I may just do that. And as long as you're going to be right here in this office, if there's anything I can help you with, just ask. And good luck. Distraction's hardly the word for that girl. When you find a stimulus like her with brains thrown in as well, then brother you've got your money's worth. Well, let's knuckle down, shall we? Come on, let's get Walcott in here. Sue, get Rick Walcott in here, will you please? [SUE] I believe he's with Condons till eleven. Fine. Well, get him over here as soon as they're finished. [SUE] Yes, sir. Rick will bring you up to date on everything. He's a good man. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS] Whatever Tanya puts in that grog of hers sure has knockout punch. Party booster it is. Speaking of parties, I think that's a good excuse. I think I'll have Tanya brew us up a bucketful. Oh no. Not after last night. We sure enjoyed ourselves, though. We don't get out too often. Mostly because of the money. Cliff just flipped over your costume. I probably won't be able to keep him away. Look Mindy, Tanya says not to worry about a thing. Come down to the club anytime you feel like it. And don't worry about the money. After all, what are friends for? Thanks Joanie. Speaking of Tanya, I have to meet Tanya at the Boulevard. At Petros. And what wild clothes they've got there. Why don't you come along with us? I think she has a surprise for you. Well, I'll probably just window shop. But, I'd like to come along. Okay. Why don't you hurry up and get dressed, and as soon as you're ready, we'll hit it. Oh, don't forget your coffee cup. - Bye now. - Okay. [MUSIC ENDS] Tell me, Cliff, what do you think about Sue? Sue? I would like to get her at the end of a blind alley. Yeah, you and every other guy in the head office. If she'd give me half a chance... Yeah, you would, you would. Lots of luck. [JOANIE] Tanya. Tanya, what do you think of this topless bikini? I think it's wild. Try it on. I don't know. You think I should, really? - Try it on, Joanie. - Kind of brief. It's great. All right, here goes. Do you mean something like this, Tanya? That's more like it. Stunning. Wonderful fabric. [MINDY] You know, I feel guilty about the things you've bought me already. [TANYA] Well, don't. I'm not exactly the poorest girl on the block. And you can make it up to me someday. Listen Mindy, if it wasn't for Tanya, I hardly would have any wardrobe at all. Don't fight it, girls. Please me, let it please you. Let me fasten here. Mindy, did anybody ever tell you you're too seductive for your own good? I don't think so. Are you coming, Joanie? Well, it's a little tight as much as there is to it. Just sit crooked. Give me the zip. Why don't we stop and have a cocktail before we go to the club? - Oh, I don't think I should. - [JOANIE] Come on. Why? Well, I have to cook dinner and everything. Forget about dinner. Be a sport, my god. Mindy, just relax. - Oh, okay. - Let's go wrap that up. Hey, what... Oh honey, I'm sorry. I've overslept. It's okay, honey. You know, you go back to sleep. I'll get some breakfast at the coffee shop. Boy, you must've really worked around here yesterday. When you hit that bed you went out like somebody hit you over the head with an axe. Now, you get lots of sleep today. Because I am not gonna have you falling asleep every time we go to bed. Bye bye. Honey, I gotta go. I'm late. Bye. You sure a roll and coffee's all you want? Mhmm, my weight. Gotta watch my figure. I'd like to watch it myself. Very closely. Oh? When did you say D.G. was leaving for Cleveland? He's leaving tomorrow. But that doesn't give you any special privileges, Mr. married man. Come on, now. You mean to say D.G.'s never given you a bad time around the office? Nobody gives me a bad time. Hey, you two. Let's head for the office. You know, Cliff, a guy could forget what time it is in company like this. Yeah, he can forget the time and a lot of other things too. Oh, men, men. Love 'em, love 'em. Let's go. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Mindy? Oh, hello Cliff. Well listen, I'm calling to say I won't be home for dinner tonight. Oh no. Not again. I had dinner all prepared. D.G's due in in the morning and uh, we're gonna have to work extra hours to get that presentation for Condon down pat. I'm sorry, hun. I understand. Your work comes first. Well, we're gonna meet with their board of engineers in just a few days and we've got to have the answers for them. Try to hurry, will you? Now, I'm not gonna be too late. But, if it gets to be bedtime and I'm not back, don't wait up for me. You know I can't sleep until you're home. Okay, hun. Bye now. Bye. Not only is amalgamite structurally superior to other lightweight synthetics, but its inert ability to disseminate both heat and cold to all the general masses of the molded form, make it a strong contender to replace all composite metals presently known. [CLAPPING] Bravo, excellent. With a pitch like that, you can wrap them up. You can't miss. You think so, huh? You bet. You know? You could sell me almost anything. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? [MAN] Mindy honey. How are you? Dad! Oh, it's nice to hear from you. I'm just fine. How are you? Oh, I'm fine honey. Tell me, why haven't you written? We sure do miss you. I miss both of you very much, too. How's mom? Oh, she's just fine. She's waiting here to talk to you. Hello Mindy. Mother, it's so great to hear your voice. Is everything all right? It's just fine. How do you like Los Angeles by now? Are you settled? [MINDY] We love it. We've got a real nice apartment. Friendly neighbors, too. Oh, isn't that nice. Is Cliff there? I'd like to say hello to him. No, he's working late tonight. He's wrapping up this big project and we're both on pins and needles. Does he work late very often? No, just lately. If he sells Condon Motors, we'll get a big boost in pay. We might even be able to afford a trip home. Oh, we'll be sure to keep our fingers crossed for you, honey. Oh, here. Dear dad wants to say something. Mindy honey, are you sure everything is all right? We were a little concerned. Everything's real fine, dad. I promised to write you a long letter right away, and tell you everything. I sure miss you and mom. We miss you too, honey. Bye and God bless you. Take care, huh? - I will, dad. - [WOMAN] Bye bye, sweetheart. Come and see us as soon as you can. We love you, honey. I love you too, mom. I'm so glad you called. - [MAN] Bye honey. - [WOMAN] Bye. Bye bye. Everything's real fine. No one can replace mom and dad, can they? Brought you a drink to cheer you up. Will Cliff be as late as usual tonight? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. Be glad when that Condon deal is over. Sometimes I just wish he'd fail so we could go back home. Mindy, you don't wish that. You don't really mean it. You've got to learn to make the best of your circumstances. Take life as it comes and just enjoy it. I'll give you a massage, it'll relax you. Oh Tanya, I don't know what I'd do without you. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? [RICK] Mindy, how are you? Oh hi... hi Rick. [RICK] How about you and Cliff meeting me for a drink tonight? Why don't you ask Cliff? [RICK] All right, I will. Put him on the line. I thought... He... he's down at the delicatessen. I'm awful tired tonight. Maybe next time, huh? [RICK] Well, we'll let you off the hook tonight but, another time real soon, okay? All right Rick. And thanks for calling. Bye bye. Oh yes. He's working tonight just like I am. Drink up, darling. There's lots more where that came from. This is the one we've been working for. Cliff, if you get the deal, could I take a trip home to see mom and dad? Maybe spend a week or two with them? Honey, if I get the Condon deal we can afford a real vacation. Like Hawaii or Mexico City or something. That can come later. Now I'd just like to see my parents. Why, Mindy Newhall, you're crying. You are homesick. Of course you can go see your folks, honey. And I'll get you that wardrobe I promised you, to take along. I don't want a new wardrobe. I don't want anything. I just wanna get away by myself for a while. To be with the folks. Well now Mindy, you're confusing me. I thought you wanted me to make some good money. So we could spend a little, buy some of the things you've wanted. I don't want anything. Except for things between us not to change. What's happening to us? I just don't like it. It isn't like before. I almost wish that we could go back to Grand Rapids. Daddy isn't well. I feel he needed me. Well, I need you too Mindy. Now you listen, Mindy. If you think I wanna get rich for myself, you're wrong. Everything I do is for you. I want you to have something, I want you to be happy. You don't need money to be happy, Cliff. If it's gonna tear us apart, I don't want any of it. [MAN] Now, this friend of mine invented an electric car. Very economical. He drove this car from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. And very even, I say. It only cost him twenty-five cents worth of electricity. The only catch is. It cost him two thousand dollars for the extension cord. That'll get it, D.G. Thank you, Sue. I had a feeling you could swing this thing, Newhall. I'm proud of you. You made a hell of a deal. We've got good reason to celebrate. Sue, Cliff, Rick, bottoms up. - Chin chin. - Here, here. I told you D.G., it was the support that I got from these two that made the difference. Well, let's have one for that. You're being too modest, Cliff. Hey, you wrapped it up, Cliff. Beyond a certain point, there wasn't anything we could do. Well, we all work together here in the company. Everyone greases his own gears and the machinery rolls. - Right? - [ALL] Right. Yes. Hey listen, why don't I call Mindy and tell her we're gonna pick her up? There's this groovy little joint out by our place. We can have some food and then some drinks. Now how 'bout it? Hey, I'm for that. What do you say, Sue? Well... all right. But not too late. Tomorrow's a work day. Oh, count me out. Thanks anyway. This is party enough for me. I'm not the rounder I used to be. But, I'll spring for the starter, though. Now, you kids go ahead and have a good time. But I'll expect you in the office tomorrow at one. No later. You know, I don't care what anybody says about you, D.G. I like you. Yes? Well, I'll expect you at eight, Walcott. Thanks, D.G. I can shake a fat head by one o'clock. How about you, Rick? I've been shaking fat heads all my life. Good. Let's go. * Over and over * The same heart in two * Somewhere beyond the night * Lies the thought of you * Some loves are over * Before they've begun * * I guess this was one Lovely, Mindy. Lovely. Very good. Very good. - Nice, Mindy. - Oh, thank you. My pleasure. Drink up, everyone. It's time. Sorry to bust up the party, but I must have all the glasses. Come on, Joanie. The party's just getting started. I'm on your side. Hey, bring us another round. Sorry, but you're gonna have to write your congressman about changing the rules. I may just do that. Well, here's mine. I've just about had it, anyway. Say, why don't we go to your apartment, Cliff? It's close by. Hey, that's an idea. Let's pick up some booze and take it up there. - What do you say, Mindy? - Oh, okay. But don't count on me to play hostess. I'm so tired, I just can hardly stay awake. I've got a great idea. Why don't we all go back to my place and have a party? After all you kids have been buying all night. It's my turn. I'll tell Joanie to bring the belly dancer and one of the boys from the band. And I'll tell our bartender to mix up a big batch of grogs. How does that sound? Great. Come on, gang. Let's go up to Tanya's. Well, here are the keys, and uh, when we finish up, we'll join you. All right? Groovy. Man, the party is just getting started. Come on, Rick. - Let's move up. - Let's go. [RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYS] Too bad ol' Mindy couldn't hang tough. She's missing a hell of a good time. Oh yeah, once she hits the sack she's usually out for the night. Hey, look at this broad! Cliff. Cliff. Your wife's a doll, Cliff. You lucky man. Yeah? Thanks. Hey Joanie, come here and show me some more of that wiggle dance. Closer. [UPBEAT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] Do you want a good time, or oblivion? Drink it that fast, darling, and it'll blind you. Come on, Mindy. Relax. [MUSIC STOPS] [SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] [CLIFF] Aagh! Get out, Joanie. You want a woman? Let's see how really good you are. Here's a willing woman. Make love to me. I said, make love to me. Now. What's the matter, little man? Stupid, impotent slob! You're like the rest of the perverted bastards who call themselves men! Your wife makes better love than you do. You bitch! You filthy rotten bitch! [TANYA LAUGHING] [CLIFF] Mindy. I'm sorry, Mindy. Mindy, please. Don't go after him. Darling, stay with me. Please, Mindy. My God, what have I done to you? Oh Cliff. [MAN] This is not the end, of course. Merely the end of a beginning for Cliff and Mindy. They have found a new and perhaps more meaningful course in life. Only because they were able to overcome those temptations which threaten to divide them. Yet, the temptations of evil go on. They manifest themselves daily, in each of our lives. We are really fortunate. We'll be able to recognize, thereby overcome them. Or maybe we would rather not.
