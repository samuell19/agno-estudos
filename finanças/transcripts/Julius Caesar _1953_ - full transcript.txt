If I have veiled my look, merely upon myself. with passions of some difference. to my behaviors, my good friends be grieved, be you one. than that poor Brutus with himself at war can you see your face? but by reflection, Brutus, that you have no such mirrors into your eye, of the best respect in Rome, and groaning underneath this age's yoke, that noble Brutus had his eyes. would you lead me, Cassius, into myself for that which is not in me? be prepared to hear. see yourself so well as by reflection, discover to yourself which you yet know not of. did use to stale with ordinary oaths in banqueting to all the rout, for their king. you would not have it so? and death in the other, as I love the name of honor as well as I do know your outward favor. or other men think of this life, I had as lief not be of such a thing as I myself. as well as he. now leap in with me and swim to yonder points?" I plunged in and bade him follow, and we did buffet it with lusty sinews, with hearts of controversy. the point proposed, if Caesar carelessly but nod on him. I did mark how he did shake.

We'll hear him. he finds himself beholding to us all. of Brutus here! - Nay, that's certain. lend me your ears. the good is oft interred with their bones. Caesar was ambitious. for Brutus is an honorable man, home to Rome, Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? Caesar hath wept. I thrice presented him a kingly crown, and, sure, he is an honorable man. not without cause. you then to mourn for him? Thou art fled to brutish beasts, My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, in his saying. Caesar has had great wrong. he was not ambitious. in Rome than Antony. His eyes are red as fire with weeping. might have stood against the world. so poor to do him reverence. and minds to mutiny and rage, and Cassius wrong, than I will wrong such honorable men. I found it in his closet. 'Tis his will. and kiss dead Caesar's wounds, and, dying, mention it within their wills, unto their issue. - The will! I must not read it. how Caesar loved you. you are not stones, but men. that you are his heirs. O what would come of it? whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. - The will! the corpse of Caesar, that made the will. and will you give me leave? - Come down! Caesar put it on. that day he overcame the Nervii. Cassius' dagger through. the well-beloved Brutus stabbed, mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, if Brutus so unkindly knocked or no. was Caesar's angeI. how dearly Caesar loved him! ingratitude, quite vanquished him, which all the while ran blood, but behold our Caesar's vesture wounded? as you see, with traitors. - Villains. - Let not a traitor live! let me not stir you up are honorable. I know not with reasons answer you. to steaI away your hearts. a plain blunt man and that they know full well nor worth, action, nor utterance, to stir men's blood. which you yourselves do know, poor, poor dumb mouths, would ruffle up your spirits, in every wound of Caesar to rise and mutiny. We'll burn the house of Brutus! - We'll mutiny! to do you know not what. thus deserved your love? to every severaI man, orchards on this side Tiber. and to your heirs forever. to walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Their names are pricked. - I do consent. Look, with a spot, I damn him. how to cut off some charge in legacies. meet to be sent on errands. one of the three to share it? who should be pricked to die on this man of diverse slanderous loads, as the ass bears gold, either led or driven, as we point the way. where we will, and turn him off, and graze in common. but he's a tried and valiant soldier. I do appoint him store of provender. may be best disclosed and bayed about with many enemies, I fear, millions of mischiefs. to do you salutation from his master. in his own change, or by ill officers, to wish things done, undone, my noble master will appear, How he received you, let me be resolved. but not with such familiar instances, conference, as he hath used of old. to sicken and decay, in plain and simple faith. you have done me wrong.

You have condemned and noted of the Sardians. because I knew the man, were slighted off. to write in such a case. that every nice offense you yourself are much condemned for gold to undeservers. that speak this, this speech were else your last! this corruption, hide his head. the ides of March, remember. for justice sake? that did stab, and not for justice? the foremost man of all this world contaminate our fingers with base bribes, of our large honors for so much trash than such a Roman. abler than yourself to make conditions. - I say you are not. Tempt me no further. to your rash choler? when a madman stares? Fret till your proud heart breaks. and make your bondmen tremble. under your testy humor? the venom of your spleen, for, from this day forth, for my laughter, when you are waspish. and it shall please me well. to learn of noble men. You wrong me, Brutus. - If you did, I care not. he durst not thus have moved me. You durst not so have tempted him. - No! I may do that I shall be sorry for. you should be sorry for. for I am armed so strong in honesty, which I respect not. which you denied me, to pay my legions, which you denied me. - You did. that brought my answer back. his friend's infirmities, greater than they are. - I do not like your faults. as high Olympus. braved by his brother, all his faults observed, by rote to cast into my teeth. and here my naked breast. will give my heart. hate him worst, than ever thou lovedst Cassius. it shall have scope. and laughter to his Brutus, ill-tempered vexeth him? - And my heart, too. to bear with me, gave me makes me forgetfuI? over-earnest with your Brutus, and leave you so. to lodge their companies tonight. with you immediately to us. you could have been so angry. if you give place to accidentaI evils. when I crossed you so? and grief that young Octavius have made themselves so strong, swallowed fire. and call in question our necessities. - No more, I pray you. come down upon us with a mighty power, have put to death 100 senators. that died by their prescriptions, - Cicero is dead, from your wife, my lord? to Philippi presently? - Your reason? that the enemy seek us. weary his soldiers, doing himself offense, defense, and nimbleness. give place to better. tried the utmost of our friends. We, at the height, are ready to decline. leads on to fortune. is bound in shallows and in miseries. when it serves, or lose our ventures. and meet them at Philippi. - Good night, my lord. good night, and good repose. - Here in the tent, sir. Thou art over-watched. by my tent. here's the book I sought for so.

Didst thou see anything? - My lord. - Nor I, my lord. to my brother Cassius. betimes before, and we will follow. the gods today stand friendly, lead on our days to age. rest still uncertain, that may befall. then is this the very last time that ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. the ides of March begun. I know not. this parting was well made. of this day's business ere it come. and then the end is known. - What says my generaI? As this very day was Cassius born. as Pompey was, all our liberties. where I perceive our light? mount thou my horse to yonder troops and here again, whether those troops be friend or enemy. what thou notest about the field. - Sirrah, what news? horsemen that make to him on the spur. before my face. thou shouldst attempt it. that ran through Caesar's bowels, shall ever take alive the noble Brutus. O yet hold up your heads! rest on this rock. and turns our swords - I'd rather kill myself. The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me here in Philippi fields. how it goes. than tarry till they push us. that we two went to schooI together. hold thou my sword-hilts, and you, Volumnius. that yet, in all my life, more than Octavius and Mark Antony his life's history. My bones would rest, some smatch of honor in it. and turn away thy face, let us use him shall lie, most like a soldier, did that they did in envy of great Caesar. made one of them. and say to all the world,
