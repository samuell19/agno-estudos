We gonna take care of that soon enough, all right? Glad you're back, man. - What? What happened? (soft hip-hop music) - So was there anything in particular that you're interested in? You need a two-door, four-door, SUV? - Nah, I just need something low-key so I can get back to Milwaukee. - [Car Salesman] Is there a price range you wanna be in? - Don't matter the price. - [Car Salesman] I got you, okay. I might have a few things, though. Let me grab some keys, I think I got some cars. - Cool. - [Car Salesman] Be right back. (hip-hop music) - T.A., T.A., T.A. - Fuck. - You know, you're a hard brother to find. Not good to show your face. - Figured I'd give myself a moment to breathe. - Stupid and not like you, but apparently you've been doing a lot of things out of character. - Come on now, nigga. That shit was faked, man. You know I don't get down like that. - Maybe, but that's not a chance I could take. Plus, I'll be doing a lot of other acquaintances a favor. (hip-hop music) - Now, you know you don't gotta do this, right? - I wouldn't do that if I was you. Might as well give that to me and come on for this ride. (hip-hop music) Not completely stupid.

Bender, sir. - (clears throat) What? What is it? - I followed up on a lead that's relating potentially to the Little Dawn case. - Uh-huh. - You see, we've stumbled across something big. Connections, networks, and it puts all of us right in the center. - What do you need? - I need a all-hands-on-deck approach. - Miraflores, have you asked her for help? - Sir, this is more than just one person. - What's she working on? (fast-paced dramatic music) (perpetrator panting) - Stop! (dramatic music rising) (both grunting) Don't move. (door clicks) (bag thumps) (door thuds) (door clicks) (door thuds) (Dimitri sighs) - I'm sorry. I know what I said, but I have to finish this. I have to go back. - You hit hard with your strong ass. - Oh, I can hit a whole lot harder. Why'd you run? - Someone starts chasing me with a gun, I don't stick around. - You heard me yelling, and I know you saw my badge. - I can get one of those delivered to my house tomorrow. - There's a killing spree going on in this city, okay? And the monster that did it is staying at a warehouse you own. - Look, two envelopes filled with cash showed up in my PO box outta nowhere, talking about renting out my warehouse, pays for a given timeframe. - [Miraflores] And? - And I accepted. - Well, that seems unprofessional. - I got paid. That's all the professionalism I need. - Yeah, that's right, 'cause you're a all-about-the-money type, right? - Thought you feds was too busy getting killed to worry about little old me. - Good people died, you hear me? He paid for a spot. Tell me who he is. (knocking on door) (door clicks) Don't. - Don't what? (door clicks) - Don't try and talk me out of it. - So you know it's a problem. - The only problem is, is that he's out there a free man. I looked that monster in the face and I didn't do anything. - Well, good. From everything you've told me, that's not enough evidence to bring in a random guy. - That was his car in the parking lot. It was him. - Let's say you're right, with everything we know about him, and you try to take him alone, do you really think you'd be standing here with me today? You've got to let this go. - Man, you'd just think, with a description of his face, there has to be something in the database. - And there wasn't. - With a skillset like that? There has to be a rap sheet or something. - Some people fall through the cracks. - Cracks? No one should be allowed to walk through a city, flip it on its head, and then just go about their day. - Look, you need to channel this energy into something constructive. Gruber's got this prison thing, scheme or something he told me about. Why don't you go see if you can help him with that? - What about this Tyler? Maybe I ought to go see what he knows. - Tyler Franklin? - Yeah. - No, that's a no-go. Apparently we didn't cross our t's and dot our i's. - He almost shot and killed an agent in the middle of a shootout. There's no double-checking needed. You can't be serious. - Goddamnit, I said no. - Sir. - The kid's a screw-up. He's gonna screw up again. - So we just give up. - Do I need to remind you that we won? - And I wonder at what cost. (door clicks) (door slams) (restaurant patrons chattering) (rain pattering) (phone keys beeping) (phone ringing) - [Dorian] Who this? - Dorian, it's me, nigga. Look, I know you're in Milwaukee right now, and I know what the fuck you're trying to do too. - [Dorian] And what's that? (thunder rumbling) - Yeah, I overheard your loud ass last time we met up. - [Dorian] (chuckles) You're a sneaky little hiding motherfucker, just like a snake. - Nigga, listen carefully. I'm gonna say this one time. Don't do this shit. - [Dorian] Aw, a snake who's in love. Let me guess, you here too, huh? (Dorian laughs) I'll take that as a yes. - Nigga, we go way back. - [Dorian] You got two options. - You ain't gotta do this shit. - [Dorian] Two options. You come with us and die like a man, or she's gonna die like the bitch that she is. - So you wanna try to play me? - [Dorian] Don't test my patience. Call me when you're ready, bitch. (phone clicks) (rain pattering) (T.A. sighs) (rain pattering) - Man, I'm about sick and tired of all this walking. - One more time around the block. - I'm good. - No, you're lucky. (birds chirping) - Bone, you didn't tell me you was coming by. - My man, I just wanted to come check on you, Ty. How you doing, man? - Ripping, still moving. - That's good, that's all that matters. - I can't thank you enough. - Man, listen, that's nothing. That's what we do, you understand? - Yeah. But you know, I don't know how or what, but I will repay you. - Gratitude. That's what it is, man. That's the kind of energy we need around us, baby. Somebody else gotta take over this shit now, you feel me? - Take over? - (chuckles) Nigga, you funny. With T.A. and Key out the picture, somebody gotta take the reigns. Might as well be you. - That's a lot of responsibility. - And I'm glad you understand that. So I'm gonna leave you two lovebirds to it, all right? Get yourself together, man. We got a lot of work to do, baby. - [Tyler] All right. (birds chirping) (car door thuds) (broom sweeping) (door clicks) - Hey, Miss, you wanna take a stroll? - That's sweet, but I'm not looking for a relationship right now. - (chuckles) Agent Miraflores, I've been looking for you. - And why is that? - 'Cause I heard you're looking for a killer, and I thought I might be of service. - Look, I don't have time for dead ends. - Well, how about a family member of his? You wanna take that stroll? ♪ Green, green, green ♪ ♪ I can hear the money callin' my name ♪ ♪ Green ♪ - Oh, it's boring. You wanna play a game or something? What's wrong with you? - When he said, "Run things," do you think he meant everything? - I don't know. - Really, like, do you know what this means? - I know I don't have a good feeling about this or him. I was so excited to come back home after graduation, but I had to come back home to you in a coma. You know, at first, I was supposed to be sad, but I was more mad that you put yourself in this type of situation. Then I thought, "Maybe he would wake up and realize that you don't belong up in this type of world." And I'll be here to help you walk right away from it. And here you is, ready to go right back into it. (sighs) - I can't just walk away. - Yes, you can, Tyler. This isn't your life. - Look around. I'm an orphan that came from the dirt. No help, no assistance, no love. How do you think I got here, honest work? - Tyler, you do have someone. - Angela... - Tyler, my family is moving. - And? - And they want me to go with them. - You a grown-ass woman. You don't gotta go nowhere you don't wanna go. What about that nice job you got? - The city's starting to be too violent for them. And I believe it's a little too violent for me too. - What about us? What do you want? - (sighs) I want a reason to stay. ♪ Green, green, green ♪ ♪ I can hear the money callin' my name ♪ - I heard about the bodies piling up in Milwaukee, and I only know one man that can create that kind of ruckus. - Okay, and who are you? - Reginald Banks. He is my nephew. My niece, bless her sweet soul, I finally got custody of her when she was seven. They were married when they were in their 20s. - Okay, listen, I can get a history lesson some other time, okay? I need the important stuff, like his name, where he lays his head, stuff like that. - But I think you need to know who he is and understand why he is the way he is if you wanna stop him. You remember the Moncado sweep? - Yeah, the disappearance of the ACEs Organization. It was a bloodbath, but I thought it was some government conspiracy that wiped 'em out. It had to be, for all of them to end up dead like that. - Nah, no group, no secret government agents. Just one man. - Not possible. - You would think. But what they did unleashed an evil in him that I see now that he can't even turn off. He's a different breed, Miraflores, and I think you know that. You know, he's not perfect. No killing machine is. And what they did to his daughter, to my niece, was unimaginable. And you ask yourself maybe why I didn't try to talk him out of it then. I don't know, but I can't sit back now. The death has to stop. - And I couldn't agree with you more. But until you give me a name, there's nothing I can do. - I can give you three.

Been back for a little bit. Just trying to get the lay of the land before I execute. - Do you hear yourself? It's eating you alive, isn't it? The death, the mayhem, the rage. You have to let it go, please. This is not about family anymore, and this is not what they would want. - There's a lot of things they wouldn't have wanted. You need to leave the city before things pop off. - Please. - Leave, now. (door slams) - No. - Come on, you haven't even heard what I have to say yet. - You still working that hitman case? - Yes. - Then no. - I'm so close to having something good on him. - What do you charge a man that can't be found? - You're scared. Why? You used to work close with Bender, that's the reason I came to you in the first place. - Too many people close to him have ended up dead or missing, and I want no part of it. - This case or Bender? - Both. - You don't trust him. - I don't trust anyone, especially you. - You swore an oath. I have something that can make everything right. - This is my private number. Only call me if you have something concrete. (traffic roaring) (phone ringing) - [Callee] Yeah. - US Attorney O'Malley, we need to get eyes on him. (hip-hop music) - [Tyler] How come I didn't know about this place? - It's above your pay grade. - Why? - You'll see. - Another disloyal-ass nigga. My, these niggas. I swear, nigga, I thought you was a better nigga than that. You already had to kill his cousin. (gun bangs) Man, these motherfuckers, man, I swear to God. - Who the fuck is that? - Some clown who thought it was a good idea to try to take advantage of us when we thought we was at a weak spot. So this nigger's name is The Messenger. (gun bangs) That's who that is. - That ain't shit. You seen this shit before. You a body. - He probably going to clean the shit out his pants right now, man. (chuckles) - Man, what happened to you, man? Man up. - You know you need somebody that can handle this shit. Ty, my guy, he can grow into it in due time. But do we got time? Let's get this nigger up outta here, man. (hip-hop music) (car engine dies) (keys jingling) - You should've left me alone. - You should have done a better job at disappearing. - My files, are they gone? - (snickers) Did you think I'd completely erase them? Don't worry, they're not in the system, but they're somewhere. - Where? - Why don't you ask him? - No flashing your badges? No reading me my rights? - No, this one's off the books. (gun thumps) (water splashing) You were an idiot for coming here. It's not like you. It's almost like you wanna die. Holy shit, you do wanna die. Well, the good news is, is that's gonna happen. But it's up to you on how painful the experience is gonna be. Who did you tell? - Tell who what? (gun hammer clicks) - Who knows about me? I need names. - I got nothing for you. - I'm gonna ask you one last time. Who knows about me? - You're paranoid, and this isn't gonna end well for you. You can't cover up everything. - I don't have to. I've got everything on everyone, including you. If I go down, this gets leaked. You see, I will always win. We will always win, because we understand the necessity of what we do. (bones cracking) What the fuck was that? - A dislocated thumb. (handcuffs clanging) - [Bender] Fuck. (door squeaking) - [Gang Member] Damn, these motherfuckers, man, I swear to God. Bitch-ass nigger. (gun bangs) (Tyler gasps) - Baby, I can barely keep eye contact with anyone. Can't eat, can't sleep, can't even think straight. I feel unstable. But thanks for coming, though. I needed this. You know, when I'm around you, I feel like I can breathe again. - You need to go get help. You need to go see somebody. People aren't meant to experience the things that you have. - I can't. - Don't say you can't afford it. - I'm just too busy. - What, too busy with Bone? Don't seem like it help. - It doesn't matter. - But you do. Don't forget that. - [Gang Member] Make sure your motherfucking pipe ain't on safety, too, nigga. - Nigga, Glocks ain't got no safety. - Fuck up. (engine roaring) I don't like that shirt, you know? - I don't like your mustache. - You thought you was on a fucking X-Men movie with that shirt on? Dumb-ass shit. - Man, that's how you gonna do it? - Man, where the fuck is this bitch at? - Man, I don't know, but he need to hurry up. Man, I don't know what's going on. - Oh shit, here this nigger go again. Fuck dude want, bro? (cup jingling) - Change? Change? - Man, I ain't got no fucking change, man. - Change? (change clanging) (gun banging) (gang member gurgling) Now, where the fuck is Dorian at, nigger? - 4919 North 19th, nigger. (gun bangs) (gun cocks) (phone ringing) - Ah, about damn time. I wasn't gonna wait too much motherfucking longer. You ready to man up? - [T.A.] You shouldn't have come here. - I can go wherever the fuck I please. You know, like that little restaurant where that pretty little thing works at. - [T.A.] You sure you wanna do this? - 100%. Hey, listen, leave me waiting any longer, and that bitch dead tonight. (door bangs) (gun bangs) - Was a third option, motherfucker. (gun banging) (upbeat dramatic music) (calm music) (water lapping) - T.A.? (calm music) (water lapping) - Nigger, I thought you was dead. - Me too, but I'm still alive. - And free. - I know, crazy. You know what they said about you? I know you wouldn't. - I know you know. There's some other niggers that I'm worried about. - Bone's nephew. But thanks to you, I got put on top. - On top, huh? Congratulations, li'l bro. You're moving up in the world. - You should come by, check us out sometime. You know I got your back. - Nah, I'ma lay low for a little bit. But I'ma beat through for sure. (calm music) (water lapping) (keyboard clacking) - Whoa. Bar fight? - What? Oh, long story. Anyway, what do you need? - What's going on? - There were a string of homicides last night that look targeted. - Well, and the local PD can't handle it? - Miraflores, it's his work. Our favorite hitman, he's back. - And I'm the last to know? - Knowing you, I figured you were already on it. - Well, how am I supposed to know? - You make any headway on his identity? - No. - You need to come to me with any new info directly. (sirens wailing) (guns banging) (horn honking) - What's up, man? - I'm good. - Just checking on you, man. You gonna bring this place down. - I'm just taking it all in. - Good, 'cause it's all yours, homie. - And you won't believe who's back. - Don't tell me. - T.A. - Wow. - Told him to come by, but you know, he wanted to lay low for a minute. - Man, I never even thought he would've came back, that's all. That's good, though. He just gave another reason to celebrate.

(door squeaks) (keys jingling) (dramatic foreboding music) (footsteps approaching) (gun bangs) - No! Jesse? Oh no! No, no, baby, no, no. No, no! (suspenseful music rising) - It's been a while since we met like this. Must be big. - There was an execution-style shooting last night. Suspect was wearing a black face mask. - He really is back. Well, why just bring me in? We need everyone on this. - In due time. But first, I need you to tell me everything you've gathered about him. - It's not much, you know that. - So who've you been talking to? (sighs) When are the lies gonna stop? I know you know something. - Yeah, and I can say the same thing to you. - I know you've been talking to Attorney O'Malley. (sighs) I hate what has to happen next. (gun hammer clicks) - When did you lose your soul? The murders, are they really him? - I don't know, I don't care. We got more important issues to worry about. - Yes, you do. I'm glad we're all here. Did you tell her who hired me? Like I believe you said, "Cleanse the city." - I did what I had to. - [Miraflores] And what was that? - I took responsibility. I took on the burden of everyone's sins. - That job's already taken. - You were just a tool for bloodshed. - But yet you tried to get me killed? - Some tools gotta be thrown away after their first use. - Stop. Good people died. And if you're the one to blame, then maybe you won't be leaving here alive. - Bone. Bone is the other side of the coin. He understands. - No, I did my research. He's just T.A.'s cousin with a few connections. - Connections, indeed. He understands balance and order, which the two of you could be a part of. - Two guns to your head, and now you want us to team up? I don't think so. - No, stop. Both of you are going in. - He's not leaving alive. - You're not making the shots, okay? I am. You're not calling 'em for me. - He's not leaving alive. - Are you just gonna give him the easy way out? He has to face the consequences. - Cute, but my plan's more effective. - And where has that gotten you? (gun banging) (gun banging) (upbeat dramatic music) (tires squealing) (car engines roaring) (tires screeching) (psychedelic music) - And so they took everything from me. They didn't deserve what those monsters did to them. There's no purpose, no life. Choices are made by the ones with the biggest stick. - [Miraflores] Do you believe that? - Does it matter? - [Miraflores] Dimitri, is that what they believed? - Don't. - [Miraflores] Allayah and Alana? - Uncle already told you everything, huh? - [Miraflores] Enough. We both just want this senseless violence to stop. - It's all senseless, isn't it? - [Miraflores] You're the one to talk. - I'm the one to finish it. - [Miraflores] The mayhem, it won't stop with you, will it? What if we just finished it? All of it. This has to come to an end. Everyone has to go down, which in turn means you won't have to keep looking over your shoulder. I can't give you a way out like you want, but how about a peaceful night of sleep? - This could all be pinned on Bender. - [Miraflores] That's just gonna bring him down. He has to have some sort of paper trail. - His hard drive, it's how he protects himself. It'll have all the evidence you'll need. - [Miraflores] Can you get it? - You mean you need me to do the illegal stuff, right? - [Miraflores] Look, if you get it to me, I can get it to the right person. - You must be hopeless. - [Miraflores] Call it angry. You know, I made myself a promise that when I found you, I wouldn't let you get away again. - Well, it looks like I'm not going anywhere for now. - [Miraflores] And Bender? - The idiot is paranoid. We'll find him. We just have to wait on him to slip up. - [Miraflores] We'll need to figure out a way to get the- - I'll take care of it. Just give me time. - [Miraflores] How could I possibly trust you? - Trust my need for revenge. (ominous music) - Where the fuck is this fat motherfucker? (door rattling) (footsteps thumping) It's about damn time. - Are you serious? FBI's all over my ass. I can't take a piss without looking over my shoulder, and you're sitting here just like it's a perfect day. - That hard to leave? - What do you think I've been trying to do? And it takes you two weeks after I've been made to answer my calls? I need a way out. - And you come to me for that? - After all I've done, it's the least you owe me. - I don't owe you shit. I just happen to be your only option of a fast getaway. They froze all your accounts, got all kind of warrants on your ass, and you can't get in touch with your other connections. Don't forget who you're talking to, Bender. - Oh, I know who I'm talking to, but if I go down, you go down too. - You like casinos? I like a nice night at Potawatomi every now and then. - And your point? - I'm a humble, simple, betting man. And for a while, you were actually a good bet. The eyes on you now, not so good. - Bone, don't do this. - Make it look like a suicide. He couldn't handle the stress of what he did to this great city of his. - I know you know about the hard drive. I got people who will release that info if anything happens to me. - You mean this hard drive? (dramatic music) Careful who you trust, Bender. Some people actually like money more than relationships. - After all I've done for you, this is how it ends? - See you around. - He knows about you. He'll be coming. - Good, I need the exercise. - [Bender] Just get off me, man.

If you have a problem with this, you can check out the big old file we got about all your illegal and problematic activities that have been going on around here. Oh, please test me. (guns clanging) Goodbye. Hello. My name is Jacobi Norman. Don't worry about a title for me right now. Just understand I'm Mr. Head Honcho in charge here for the time being. And as such, I'm here to let you know that they found Bender dead by suicide in his house. Neighbor reported hearing a gunshot, and police went in and found his body. As shocked and as unprepared as you are by this, that puts a cold chill down my spine. I need to know about every single case you guys got going on. So get your shit together, because I want reports on my desk by the end of the day. We are gonna start... What's this stuff still doing on the ground? Come on, people, we are not Congress. We are gonna start working with efficiency and common sense around here. Can someone please get this where it belongs? And the rest of you start working on those reports. You, come with me. (phone ringing) - I'm sorry, sir. You all right? - [Jacobi] Yeah. - You should know we checked every inch of Bender's place, and he was long gone. - Yeah, I know. Looks like the guilt brought him back. - That doesn't make any sense. - Nothing does in this corrupted-ass place, except for you. Look, I don't believe this was a suicide either. And I am positive that the autopsy's gonna confirm that. - So what was it, a distraction? - You know, when I read your reports, I just knew I was gonna like you. There's a lot you can tell about an agent from their reports. You know what I can tell about you? - No, what? - You're trustworthy. And you confirmed that again by figuring all this out about Bender. - Well, thank you, but I can't take all the credit. He kind of revealed himself. - Look, I assume that you know that the hitman is back in the city. - Allegedly. - Right. So do you happen to have any clue where he allegedly might be? - (sighs) No, no. I wish I did. - As do I. As do I. (phone ringing) (hip-hop music) - Looks like the VPs are trying to test our patience. They've been popping up in seven of our territories. - Why ain't we taking off? - That was it, we already tried that. In my opinion, we're still in recovery mode. I think it's better- - You've gotta be fucking kidding me, right? "In my opinion, I think..." This that bullshit. This little nigga can't even come through with his mind made up. Bone, you should be the one- - I'm just a man waiting on orders like you. - From a kid? - You can talk to me, nigga. - And what you gonna do with that besides make me mad? ♪ I can't entertain you niggers, I'll be too busy ♪ - Exactly. Nothing, like I thought. Now put that little shit down and get back to barking your weak-ass orders.

What do you mean? - 'Cause I was gonna beg you to make a choice like usual, just so we can end up eating at Sherman Phoenix. - Because I like Sherman Phoenix. - I do too, but maybe we just switch it up a little. - Okay. Well, let's switch it up, then. - We're going to Sherman Phoenix? - Yes. (giggles) (hip-hop music) What happened to your hand? - I got angry. - And who was on the other side of that anger? - Someone that just kept running their mouth. (Angela sighs) I tried to keep it cool. - But you didn't. Tyler, if you keep on going down this road, it's gonna change you for the worst. - What if I'm already changed? (Angela sighs) When I got shot, I went down as one man. But when I'm with you, I feel myself again. I feel good. - So what happens when you're not with me? (hip-hop music) You know, for the longest time, I dreamt of the day that you will wake up and see the stupidity of all of this. But then we thought that you was gonna die. You know, I just... I felt like I failed you. Then you made it through, and I just felt like I should have just told you all my worries. You know, I wish that you would see the chance that God gave you to leave this life. - I can't just leave. - Yes, you can, Tyler. It's destroying you. Don't you see that? (hip-hop music) (Angela sighs) (keys jingling) (door banging) - Long work day? - Was it you? - Was what me? - We had a plan. All we had to do was wait for the right moment. Why? - What are you talking about? - Stop playing dumb, okay? I put my career on the line for this plan. If they find out... Why'd you kill Bender? (Dimitri sighs) It wasn't you. Then who? - Somebody powerful who probably still has the hard drive right now, if they didn't destroy it already. - Who could it be? - How far did you take Bender at his word? - Now? Not as far as I can throw him. - We have no other leads. - Bone. - I'll look into it. - Well, you better pray he has it. (Dimitri sighs) Oh, and Dimitri, don't you ever come into my home again. (footsteps clacking) Oh my God. You want me to what? - Just let it sink in, okay? You don't have to make any decisions right now. - Well, what about you? - Me? No, my time here is not permanent. I'm more of a stepping stone. - [Miraflores] Oh. - An exampled standard of what the new head honcho oughta be. - And you want that to be me? - [Jacobi] Mm-hmm. - Sir, there are other agents that have been here longer than me, and I'm not qualified. - Oh, gimme a break. Qualifications are just words on a piece of paper. You've seen more in the last year than half these agents are gonna do in their entire careers. Now, you need to understand something. You got the attention of all the right guys at the top, and they think you can do this. And more importantly, they can trust you. - Sir, how do I lead people that don't respect me and, to be honest, I don't trust? - Yeah, that is an unfortunate occupational hazard, especially in your case. Look, all I'm asking you to do is think about it. There's no rush, okay? (Miraflores sighs) (hip-hop music) - I know we in recovery mode and all that shit, but we could be making bigger moves. Tyler my dude, but we need to be loyal to this shit here first. That nigger ain't good for it neither. Moving too scary, moving too slow. - Why'd you say that? - I'm saying that 'cause he ain't built for this shit, not for no shot-calling. I don't know why Bone picked him, but shit, we gonna handle his understandable mistake so we could get things back to how they used to be. ♪ Gotta be there for my children ♪ ♪ So they don't make the same mistakes as me ♪ ♪ Taught you how to get it ♪ ♪ So you ain't never gotta wait on me ♪ - Tyler, my family is moving in a couple of days. We've been ignoring the inevitable. - I don't see any packed boxes. - Yeah, and I haven't put in my two weeks at work either. You wanna know why? - Because you want me to change? - No, because I love you. You don't see that? You don't see that I had chosen you? Why can't you choose me? - I have. - As long as you've chosen this world, Tyler, you haven't. - Is this what this is? The crew or you? - No, I'm just...

I'll be back. ♪ No one was there to teach me ♪ ♪ I cut off all the fake niggers ♪ ♪ So no one's there to leach me ♪ (Angela sighs) (intense suspenseful music) - [Bone] (sighs) I can't believe, brother. - Man, what are you doing? - Well, unfortunately, your OG here just happens to be a fucking snake. We've been tracking his movements and come to find out he been sneaking behind our backs, killing our fucking people. - So now what? You kill the killer? - No, you will. - Why? - I can appreciate your hesitancy, but this nigger's full of envy, and there ain't no room for no motherfucker like that in this organization. He got to go. He been plotting on you this whole time, and you fell for it. Good thing word got back to me when it did. Ain't that right, Jay? - Gimme a reason why I shouldn't blow your brains all over this floor. - Nigger, you weak. You don't know shit. I know it and they know it. I wouldn't give a fuck if you was my mama, nigger. (gun bangs) (body thumps) - Listen, I know that was hard to do, but it was very necessary. (suspenseful music) Now it's time to celebrate. - Man, I think I need to go. - You need to go? Listen, I don't have the time for that. You just killed one of your own, and you did it for a valid reason. You can't be showing no weakness, I keep telling you that. You keep doing that shit, nobody's gonna listen to you, right? (ominous music) (footsteps) Be able to grab the first one, and you know, you take me over there, I can handle that shit, nigga. You know what I'm saying? - Bone. - Yeah. - Why you had me do that, man? This isn't the game. This is death. - This the part of the game you need to understand, young dog. You see, it ain't all about fucking bitches and getting money. You know that, right? It's deeper than that. All this shit we got? Blood, sweat, and tears, hustling on them corners, well before you came along. What you need to understand is this shit requires you to know how to move pawns. And when you learn that, then you can do this shit. - A pawn? That's all I am? - Listen, no one lives forever, not even me. As much as I would like to think that, it's just not realistic. You know, when I think back on when me and you first met, I seen you breaking niggas, the fearlessness you had in you, that shit reminded me of myself. Then, when you got shot, and I seen you in the hospital, it reminded me of every young nigger that ever came along. But one thing about you that was different, you was a fighter. And that's when I knew you had to carry this shit on. - Carry what on? - The balance. You can't see it, but it's like gravity. It's necessary. You need to let me show you what's behind these curtains, man, 'cause I believe in you, just like I told you in the beginning. That's what's gonna move us through this whole ordeal. - I want peace. - Nigga, fuck peace. You think greatness is attained in times of peace? It's not. The shit you did in that basement was required. Get that in your head. That's what you gotta understand, that ain't gonna be the first time. But if you let me show you, we gonna be all right. - So now what? - You locked in now. Ain't no getting out, this shit is forever. Wanna drink? (ominous music) (Bone sighs) - Your gun. Where's the hard drive? - Hard drive? I don't own a hard drive. (Dimitri sighs) Dimitri Foster, right? - Drive, now. - Let's go inside and talk about this. - Drive. (ominous music) - So this is where you kill me? A raggedly-ass warehouse? - [Dimitri] Where is it? - Where's what? - Don't play stupid. Bender been working for you the entire time. - Bender? The FBI agent? - Why so desperate to hide behind the curtains? - Why are we at a warehouse near the dump? - I know you run this city. - Man, I don't know where the fuck you getting your information from. I'm just a man picking up the pieces. - Get out. (door clicks) (door slams) You can make this painless. Just tell me where it is. - You kill me, you'll never find it. - I thought you had no clue. - Look at you, a man full of threats. I will admit, though, your follow-through game is impeccable. - Then you know not to make me ask again. - Before we proceed with the dramatics, I would like to ask you one question. When will all this shit break you? - I could ask you the same thing. - Nah, bruh. We different. When I look at you, all I see is desperation. It's all in your eyes. Pain, death, taking lives everywhere you go, even the ones you love. Yeah, Bender told me everything. You were the perfect hire. To me, I didn't give two fucks. I'm gonna tell you just like I tell everybody else. Fall in line and get the fuck outta my way. - Not just picking up the pieces. - Maybe yours. (gun banging) (guns banging) - [Angela] Hey, this is Angie. I'm sorry I couldn't get to your call, but if you leave your name and message, I'll get back at you soon. Thank you. - Hey, baby. About the other day, I'm sorry. You know, there's a lot going on right now, a lot of responsibility, and I hope you understand that. But even if you don't, I do. But I'm about to be on the way over there to talk to you. (Tyler sighs) (door bell chimes) (restaurant patrons chattering) - You gonna make me ask? - (sighs) I was set up. - Do you need more time off? - No. I'm pissed. Bender was right. It's Bone. And he has the hard drive. - How did you know? Did he show you? Did you see it? - I know it. - We cannot afford to go off your guesses right now. - I've been following his crew around. I think I know where he's keeping it. And if I'm right, I think there's a way we can kill two birds with one stone. (restaurant patrons chattering) (door bell chimes) ("Charge" fanfare) (baseball commentator rambling) - Since when'd I tell you to start sitting down? - We got a new boss. Asshole's cracking down on everybody. - Man, that sounds like a you problem. ("Chase" fanfare) (sports commentator rambling) (baseball crowd cheers) - It's kinda light. They won't like that. - Yeah, that hard drive from Bender, I'll be keeping that, which means I'm gonna be giving you and your friends what I wanna give you from now on. Get the fuck outta my face. (baseball commentator rambling) (door clicks) (footsteps) (intense dramatic music) - [Dimitri] There was a list, a long one. All your names are on it. (intense dramatic music rising) - Bone, cuz, may I ask you a question? Who was in charge when all of this shit happened? - Dog, you forgot what we said when we first started this whole thing? I was gonna play the back, you was gonna play the front. - Right, right, right. - What happened with all of that? - So where's the man of the hour, huh? (chuckles) - Man, listen, I get it, man. You took your shots, you missed, and you pissed. But we gonna get another chance. Next time this lang stick his head out, we gonna tear that motherfucker off. - Was I ever really calling the shots, bro? - Dog, that's this shit talking. Now it's Ty's time to shine. - Oh. - And hopefully, with our help, he won't make the same mistakes that we did. - Right. Right, right, right. So tell me, what's it? Where's Egg? Yeah, the hitman? - Dimitri? - (mumbles) - I don't know. - What's he looking for, man? - I don't know. - Mm. Are you sure? - I'm positive. Why would I call you in if I had something to hide, man? - Right. - What's up with all the 21 Questions, cuz? - Hey, man. ♪ Girl, that nigga ain't shit ♪ ♪ It ain't my kind ♪ - Dog, everything gonna be cool, man. I just need T.A. to get back to T.A. - How the fuck am I supposed to get back to T.A., huh? Knowing that this nigger here is out here, huh? - So you telling me you worried about this clown? Since when we worried about motherfuckers like that, man? Huh? - Yeah, all right. - Come on, baby. Come on. ♪ You just another guy ♪ - All right. (sniffs) (door clicks) - Baby. Angela. (paper rustling) (Tyler sighs) - [Angela] Tyler, you in too deep, and I won't be a part of it. I'm gone. And don't come looking for me. Angela. - Damn, I hope they left this key. (suspenseful music) - Man, what are you doing? - Ty, man, I was just- - We made the streets safe for you again. We brought you back into our home. - Man, I ain't asked for shit. - Nigga, you ain't have to. Now you sneak around like a little bitch. - (scuffs) Oh, you feeling yourself, huh? Man, there's a lot of shit going on that you don't know nothing about. Bone been- - Bone's not in charge, I am. - Wow. Well, let me tell you something, nigga, you killed a whole fucking federal agent, and not in jail. How the fuck do you think that happened? Bone been playing us, nigga. Get your shit together. - Couldn't wait a second to make your move, could you? - Nigga, fuck you. (fist thumping) - [T.A.] (coughs) Oh shit. - How the fuck do you think you and Keyshawn kept slipping through the feds' fingers? Luck, nigga? And how do you reward me? By outsourcing guns and drugs. - Nigga, we was trying to come up. - No, you got cocky, nigga. Think I wasn't gonna find out. I gave you all the game you got, and that's how you repay me, cuz? (ominous music) It was me that killed the bitch. (gun bangs) (ominous music) You forgot the rules, nigga. - Your own cousin? - That's right. You slipping, man. (suspenseful music rising) (gun bangs) (glass breaks) (guns banging) (intense dramatic music) - [Dimitri] The hard drive. (sirens wailing) (sirens wailing) (police radio chattering) - Don't you play dumb with me. - I'm working on a case. - A case I should have been informed about. - I have to keep this to myself. - (scuffs) Really? You know, you're not sitting in this chair just yet, and you are seriously risking the opportunity to do so. So you either bring me up to speed on what's going on, or you put your badge and your gun on this desk and you leave. You can't trust us, we can't trust you. (birds chirping) - Man, what? - What you mean, "What?" What, you best friends with the feds now? Look man, I'm having a real hard time not killing your ass. - I know. (footsteps crunching) This her. - Man, I'm not working with the fucking feds. It's the lot that got me into this mess in the first place. - Well, good, 'cause I'm not one anymore anyway. - Fuck outta here. - Wait, what? - (sighs) It doesn't matter. What does, is this evidence. We need to finish this. - We? - Yeah. - But I just outed Bone. I'm not going down with these- - Stop. He took everything from you. Why not take everything from him? - And then what? Can we even take that shit to the feds? - To be honest, I don't trust them either. - Oh fuck, man. - Maybe the guy that doesn't trust anyone is the one we can trust. - Man, y'all figure this shit out. (birds chirping) (footsteps crunching) - Are you ready to do your job? - I told you to only call me if you had something concrete. - Okay, look, I'm working with the hitman, all right? - Are you insane? - He helped me get the evidence. - Blinded by your own ambition, just like Bender. - No, I'm nothing like Bender. Can I trust you? - Can you trust me? You're the one who called me. - Look, if I get you the evidence, will you just do what needs to be done? - Even if it means bringing you in. (Miraflores sighs) When? - Tomorrow, I'll text you a time. - Where? - [Miraflores] You choose. - You sound just like my wife on date night. Listen, I don't got time for this.

How you doing, angry man? Okay, let's get to business. I'm here to extend an offer. There's a lot of power and determination at this table. Why let it go to waste when we can do such great things for this city? - Is that the same lie you told T.A.? - You mean the traitor? (footsteps crunching) - Man, what the fuck is wrong with you, Ty?

I'm just cleaning up the mess y'all made. - And now you about to make somebody else the face of it all, right? - You ain't gotta do this. - Don't complicate things. All you gotta do is tell people what they wanna hear, not what they need to hear. - Hmm. (bomb ticking) - Dimitri. - He needs to die. - And what about us? - [Dimitri] It's a sacrifice. - It's not gonna make it better, okay? No, look, it can't help anything, 'cause it's just gonna make it worse. - You know what? This whole room, everybody in it, we need to die. - Move in, move in, move in! - Everybody, put your hands up! (guns banging) (sirens wailing) - Put the gun down. Put the gun down. - I'm not going to jail. (guns banging) (suspenseful music) - No! (guns banging) (bullets ricocheting) - Everybody put your hands up and drop your weapons. (intense dramatic music) (door squeaks) (footsteps) (suspenseful music) Drop your weapon! (gun bangs) (ominous music) - What happened? We could have worked together, hmm? Pitiful. (dramatic music) (Bone grunting) (fist thumping) (sirens wailing) - I still don't know how they figured out where I live. - Relax, as soon as we heard about it, we sent people over. Your family's safe. - Thanks. - Take his ass away. He got a new home now. I had a feeling Bone would make a move on us, just didn't know how or when. You know, having evidence on him is great, but catching him in the act, oh, it's even greater. - Yeah. What I'm really trying to figure out is how the fuck you get away with that without a leak? I guarantee you're gonna find a couple of your homies on that drive. - Yeah, you're probably right. Well, we only told the ones that we thought we could trust, and that wasn't a lot, you know? The ones that would do the right thing. It wasn't easy, but it worked. Everyone will catch wind of this soon. The rest, we'll get to 'em. Looks like the rumors are true. You worked with the feds. - Now what? - Well, the way I see it, you got two choices. One, you could run. There's a lot of distractions going on, and maybe you'll get away. Or two, word on the street is I'm due for a promotion, so I could see to it, with the best of my ability, to seek immunity for all your help. - Even with all the shit that I've done? - I mean, I didn't say it was gonna be easy. - Look, I'm tired of running.
