Shit. Give me a cigarette. - Give me a cigarette, all right? - Here you go. Where's the fucking lighter? Hi. Hey, Bee. Hey, Stan. How's work? - The same shit. - Hmm. Can we talk? Sure. Alone? Y'all go on inside. So what's up? Just give me a second. Bee? I went to the doctor. Yeah? What? I don't know. I just... - You just what? - Oh, God, I can't do this. Can I just get a glass of water first? You just tell me now. I'm pregnant. Well, shit... Did you just hear what I said? Yeah, I heard you. But I thought it was impossible. Yeah, me, too. What happened to your lip? Nothing. Well, you thought you could just sneak in here and cover it up before I got back home from work? Look, I'm having this baby, okay? And it might be the only chance I get. - All right. Well... - No, just hear me out. We can leave it at this. You know, you can... I don't know, go on with your life and just go our separate ways, and I'll just... I'll raise him myself. Him? It's a boy? Well, it better be. I don't want the competition. Y'all having son? Dude! Oh, shit! Sorry, man. The doors is open. - Shut it. - Shut the fucking door, Stan, please? Whoo! I'm gonna be an uncle. Wipe that smile off your face, Jimmy V, I'm not done yet. I don't want our boys seeing you with a lip like that, ever. Yeah. We've gotta change. Okay? And I want a house. Doesn't have to be anything fancy. Just somewhere safe. Okay.

Jim, get the fucking phone, now! Come on. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. I just need you to breathe. Come on. Come on. Yeah, my son, he just fell down. 211 Pinewood Avenue. Is he breathing? - Good job. You got it. - Is he breathing? - Yeah, he's good. - Yeah, he's breathing, but he's shaking now. - I got you. - Are you coming? - It's okay. - Okay. They're going to be here soon, okay? Okay. I'm not sure what happened before... Jim, what happened? Did he fall? Yeah, he was... He just kind of sat down, and then he just went back. And then he just... And then he started having a seizure. Okay. Does he have a history of seizures? Do you know? - No. - How long did this happen? - Um, I don't know. Maybe a minute or two. - Okay. Did he hit his head by any chance? No. - Jim? No. - No, no. Okay, pal. All right, Jack, we're gonna give you some oxygen, okay? Nice big breaths, buddy, okay? Get out of your way. - Nearest hospital okay? - Yeah. Yes? Who's riding with us? Um, I will. Okay. No, I'm just... I need to understand is all. So... what you're saying is that we need to wait for a prior authorization to get approval for the treatment that this doctor's recommended to us? Well... Well, how long is that going to take? Well, we don't have that kind of time. I... I'm not raising my voice. I'm just telling you that we don't have that time. Well, what if we want a... a different treatment altogether? Yeah. Yes, like out of network, or whatever. We're not covered? At all? So, you're... So you're saying that, um, this is pretty much our only option? So that's it, then? No. Mm-mm. Okay. I just won't accept it. I won't. - The doctor said... - I don't care what the doctor said. He can't die. I know. I know. You fly over the city, across the border. Up, up you go. You want to know where we're going? To the Gold Cattle Island. Does that make you happy? It makes me happy, too, to see you happy. Goodnight, little buddy. So I talked to Jenna from work, and her mom went through this treatment at Boston University Hospital, and they've got this cancer center for kids. Okay? And they've got, like, this whole different approach to the way they treat a tumor. And they've got this new treatment where they block something called... PRMT5 and that's supposed to stop the tumor from growing. And then they do, you know, radiation therapy and drug therapies, or whatever after that. But the doctor said it's spread too much, and they couldn't take it out. Well, that's exactly what they told Jenna's mom, and she ain't dead yet. Did you find out how much it was? Not exactly, but, um, they said anywhere up to like... $250,000. I know. Where are we going to get that kind of money? I don't know. I... I don't know. We gotta figure it out, because we're all he's got. And we got to take care of him. I know that. I'm just... Um, maybe we should listen to the doctor. He doesn't have much time left. And what? Write him a fucking bucket list? Raise money so he can fucking skydive over the Grand Canyon? Huh? What if that's the only choice we got? I'm not giving up on him. And you promised to take care of us. You remember that? Yeah, I do. I'm just... I'm just trying to make the right decision. I don't have that kind of money. I'm barely making it month by month. We just got the new trucks. I'm maxed out financially. What do you want me to do? I don't know. How about the bank? Yeah. We're going there this afternoon. Just need more options. Oh, I'm sure they'll help. Do you need some time off? No, I don't need time off. I need to make some goddamn money, James. I mean, no long hauls. But I have to work. I understand. How about the Houston run? Would that work for you for a while? Yeah, that's a start. He'll be all right, you'll see. Yeah? How do you know? It's a lot of money. Yeah. Fucking assholes. $2,000 in credit. Are you fucking kidding me? What are you yelling at me for? I wasn't the one in there. My mom better help. I know she can sell that house. - Fuck's sake... - No, don't, Jimmy. This is too much, darling. Well, you must have been cooking all day. Almost. - Oh. - Whoa! Hmm. - Dean, would you like a beer? - I would. Damn nice. Okay. Hey, Mom, Dean. Uh, we've got something we need to talk to you about. You're not divorcing, are you? No, we're not divorcing, Sue. - Oh. - Jack is sick, Mom. Sick? How? Sick like he's got a tumor in his brain. Look, we found a treatment in Boston, okay? And they got real good doctors. And they can give Jack a real good chance. But we're not covered. And it's expensive. So we're maybe hoping that y'all can help out. With money? Yes, Dean. Money would be helpful in our situation. Better than a hug. So the cancer doesn't spread anymore. Well... how much is it? $50,000 to start. Oh. You know we don't have that kind of money. What about Grandpa's house? - Hon, we can't get rid of that damn house. - Mm-mm. There's more debt than money in it. You fucking owe me, Mom. You know that. Hey, don't you talk to your mama that way. Like what, Dean? Don't tell me how to talk to my mama. You know what? Just get the fuck - out of my house. - Bee, Bee. Thank you for dinner. Come on. Shit. $73. Thanks, Dean. Are you fucking kidding me? Well, at least we know they're not coming back anytime soon. So what? You know, I'm trying my hardest here, and I mean, what the fuck are you doing? What are you talking about? - I mean, does he even matter to you? - Don't fucking say that. Well, then, man the fuck up, Jim. What do you want me to do? Go steal my mother's welfare checks? How is that going to help anything? Bee. No. You know what? You stay here and you take care of Jack. Oh, what, you angry? Good. Dad? Dad? - Mm. - Your phone. Your phone. Yeah? What? Hey, Jim, top floor, brother. All right, take care of Jack. - What, he's in here? - Take care of Jack. Get up and let's go. Come on. Jack's in the car. What the fuck, man? She's my wife. She's my fucking wife! How much did you make? I need some extra cash. Can you hook me up? Shit, I mean, I got a little bit, but I spend that shit as soon as I get it, you know that. Can you set up a meeting with people needing transportation? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know some people. They are not nice people though, brother. - Bee is not gonna like that. - I don't care, man. I don't care. What's going on, bro? Bee's off the hook out there in the club. - You can't be letting her go out there like... - Jack is sick. What? He's got cancer. She's just trying to make some money, trying to help him out. How bad is he? It's pretty bad. Oh, shit, bro. Oh... fuck. I'm sorry, brother. Finally invited me out here, and it's for this. Oh, shit. You're gonna meet a guy with a red truck, all right? Okay. He's going to take you to a meeting. You just let the other guys do their thing, and you go on with them. Cover your eyes. You can go ahead and take it off. - I'm Jim. - I know who you are. Have a seat. So, what are you doing here? You didn't talk to my brother? Stan? He tell you what we do here? No. But you have a pretty good idea, right? Yup, I do. I'll cross whatever over the checkpoint. So here's how it is. You know what happens to you if you fuck me over, right? We come for your kid. And your wife. You understand? That enough information? Yeah. All right. But I want to make one thing clear, though. You ever threaten my family again, or come close to them, and I'm gonna fucking kill you. That's good to know. Here's how it works. We tell you where to stop. When you do, you walk away from your truck, you get a bite to eat maybe, or you take a piss. When your truck is visible again, that means that we're off. Maybe you carry. Maybe you don't. When you get across a checkpoint, we'll send you a message, tell you where to stop. You do the whole thing again. Walk away from your truck, wait till it's clear. When you get back to your truck, you check the glove compartment. Your payment will be in there with a new phone. Get rid of the old one. And don't do anything else on it. You keep the battery charged. That's it. Easy-peasy. - Okay. - Time to go to work. Now get the fuck out of my truck. What are you carrying? Uh, just stuff from work. - From work? - Yeah, McAllen. - You got your paperwork? - Yup, right here. Right. Just a second, hold on. Where you going? I'm gonna go to Houston. Houston? What part of Houston? - Phillip sons, east side. - East side? Yeah. All right. Carry on. All right. Yeah. Got a light? Where you headed? - Houston. - Sounds good. Ain't too far. I'm headed all the way up to Toronto. That's a long haul. What's it like up there? It seems pretty nice, the little I've seen. People seem friendly. It's a little different, but kind of the same, you know? Hmm. Yeah. What about Houston? It's Houston. - Have a good one. - You, too. Where'd you get this from? From James. - Oh, yeah? - It's a loan. Well, you tell him we'll pay him back. I did. Where is he? Sleeping. He's exhausted. Been tough on him. Yeah, I bet. Gonna give them a call and see if we can get the first flight out tomorrow. - Yeah? - Yeah. I called them and said we'd figure it out. And they said once we did give them a call, they'd get us in to see the doctor right away. That's good. All right, buddy. Huh? Give me a hug, bud. You'll be back soon. - Okay? - Mm-hmm. You be good to your mom, okay? Okay. Take good care of him. Yeah. Now, there's food in the fridge, and try to keep those plants alive, okay? - I will. - Okay. Dr. Garrett, this is Beatrice, Jack's mom. Okay. Thank you. - Have a seat. - Thanks. Nice to meet you. I really don't like desks a whole lot, because I think they kind of put distance between people. But it's the situation, makes it easier, you know, for us to have a conversation. And I want you to feel comfortable. So tell me, what's going on? Um, well, after Jack's incident at home, where he had a seizure, and then we took him to the hospital, um, they ended up telling us about his condition and unfortunately, at home, just our options with insurance and as far as even getting the right treatment, or treatment I was comfortable with, um, there just wasn't much of an option there. So that's when we started to look into other things, and found you guys. Well, I'm really glad you made the trip. Now, I notice that Jack didn't come with you today. Um, how much does Jack know about what's going on? We told him that we just... you're going to treat him for the seizures. Yeah. I feel like, um, we just... I think it would be better for his mental state if he didn't know for the time being. Anyways, I just I want him to stay really strong, and I just feel like this is the best way. I want you to know that you are not alone in this. This is a team effort. It's you, me, and Jack working together to beat this, make it happen, make it go away, and make him better. Hey, Dad. Hey, Jack. How you doing? - Good. - What, are you in a hotel room? No. Where are we? Hospital. Yeah. We just wanted to check in and say hi. Jack's going for his first treatment tonight, so... How do you feel about that? I don't know. It's okay to be nervous, okay? Hmm. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go talk to your daddy for a second, okay? - Okay. - Okay. You wanna say bye? - Bye, Dad. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. Um, sorry. I want to talk to you about the money. Are you gonna be able to put more money in the account? I thought we worked that out. No, it's just, it's the first installment, so it looks like we're probably gonna need, um, same amount, I'm guessing. Yeah, I can put it in your account tonight. Okay, good. And we're going to have to be here about a month, they're saying right now, okay? Yeah, I figured as much. I love you. Yeah, I love you, too. Hey. Yeah. Put in an order. Okay. How much is it? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You go to the window and who do you see? The Swamp Lion. He looks weak. I know. I wish you were here. Yeah. Me, too. I don't know, I'm just tired. Tired? There ain't time to be tired, dummy. Get up off that bed now! - Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. Doctor said his numbers are up. Treatments cost more money, so... - How's it going? - Good. How are you? - Good. Where are you going today, sir? - Houston. You don't want to talk about what's going on over there? The nurses said I was really sick with cancer. I heard them say it in another room. They must have been talking about somebody else, okay? You're not that sick. You think if you were that sick, I'd be over here and you'd be over there? You know, I'd be there, right next to you. Okay? I'm not stupid. They were talking about me. Jack's not responding to the treatments. So he needs new ones, better ones, and they're expensive and we can't afford it. Fuck. I'm sorry, brother. I just need to make more money. How, uh... How fast? Fast. All right. I think I know somebody. You know, they'll take a little bit of a cut, but it's doable. I think he might die. And I can't breathe when I'm not working, I'm not making money, and I'm not trying to help him. And it could be for nothing. And I haven't seen him. And I'm just fucking scared, Stan. I'm fucking scared. All right, brother. I'm gonna get you out of here. All right? Gonna get outta here. Come on. Come on. Hello, ladies. How you guys doing? - Hey, mama. - Hey. How you doing? Y'all ever met my brother before? - No. Hi. - Hey, this is Jim. - Lynette. - Nice to meet you. Don't be shy, brother, you can say it. At least smile a little bit... - Hello, Charlie. - Hi, baby. How you doing? Come on, I'm sure you know my brother. Yeah, I know your brother. Come on. - Bye, ladies. - Bye. What are you doing here? Well... we need a little more money. You okay? What for? My... My son is sick. He needs treatment. Is crossing not enough? No. Shit. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you help? - I mean, it depends. - On what? If you're willing to fuck with a boss. Shit. Are you that dumb? I think my brother's dumb. Yeah, I'm pretty fucking stupid. I'm right here, right? This shit runs the family, baby. Yeah, all right. All right, so how does it work, or what do we do? Girls. - Yes? - Can you get out? Yeah. Well... you let me in your truck, I skim a little of the stuff they put in there, and then I get out before you deliver. That's it. - That's it? - That's it. We'll split 50-50. We got a deal? Yeah, we got a deal. Don't fuck it up. Oh, he will be all right. - Now get out. Yeah, I like you, too. I'll be right here. Get out! We'll be at Romeo's later. - Get out. - Oh, shit. - Cool? That's cool. Where's your old man? - Stupid. - You need another beer? - I'm good. - All right. You want a shot? - No, I don't need a shot. Need some elbow courage? No, we got plenty of shots. I'm good. Just leave me alone, man. - Fuck it. - Fuck it. Got a cigarette? That I do. Jim. Charlie... You are nothing like your brother. No, he talks too much. Oh, yeah. A lot of bullshit. Yeah. You're beautiful. Wow. Well, now you sound like him. Sorry. No, no, no, I like it. So, Jim... Yeah, Charlie. What is it that you want? You want another drink? Yeah. Come on. Let's have another drink. - Hello, sir. How you doing? - Doin' good. - Where you coming from? - McAllen. What do you got in the load? Uh, just stuff from work. Okay. Where'd you pick it up from? - McAllen, at work. - Okay. You usually pick it up there? - Yep. - You doing all right, sir? Yeah, I'm doing all right. Yeah. Okay. Might we take a look at your load? - Yeah. Don't mind. - Okay. Just do me a favor. Just travel to the left over here and we'll be with you in a few seconds. Can you step off the truck, sir? All right. Step over here, sir, please. - Oh. - Yep. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah, man. My AC broke, you know, I'm actually sweating like a pig. - This is where you usually pick it up from? - Yeah, right there. - Did you load it up yourself? - No, no. Somebody else loaded it up. Same thing every day. Dogs look kind of agitated. - Yeah, it might be the heat. - What was that? I said maybe they don't like the heat. Yeah. - Right, sir. You're good to go. - All right. - You guys have a good one. - You, too. - Hey! - Hi. What the fuck you doing here? I... I got your 12K. Hi. Come right in. So how's my grandson? You know, he's hanging in there. He's all right. Well, I want to do something, and I want you to have this. No, Ma, I don't need the money, okay? Yes, you do. You need the money for your medicine. I'm not going to take that, okay? We're covered. - Well... - Hey. How about I buy your car? Okay? Give you a little money, you can pay for your meds. - You'll be all right. - You want my car? Mm-hmm. I just need a spare car. We're driving Jack around all over the place now. So... What do you think? You get some money. You're not driving, right? - No. - Still running? Last time I checked, it was running. All right. There you go. What's really going on here? Nothing's going on. I need a spare car and you need your medicine. We both win. - Where are the keys? - In the drawer. Hold on one second. He's coming out. Okay, come here, slowly. Let's have a look at you. Hey, Jack. How you doing, buddy? You look sad. I'm okay, Jack. Can you tell me the rest of the story? Yeah. Yeah. Where were we? The hot air balloon. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember. Okay, So... they're all in the balloon, flying high up in the sky. You look and you see the island. And you say... "How do we get in?" "Get in?" the hummingbird says. And then you realize there's something that the hummingbird didn't think about. Before you can say, "No," Swamp Lion runs up all the way to the roof, puts bombs on there and he lights the wick and... Everything's going crazy in your mind and you say, "Everybody, get down!" And all the hummingbirds fly to the corners and you look at the Swamp Lion and you say, "Swamp Lion, why?" Swamp Lion says, "Because it's good." And you say, "No!" And all of a sudden, it just explodes! The roof flies off, the sun comes down, blinds your eyes. You can't really see that well. You look around. And then you see him lying on the ground, and he looks at you. And he gives you that big smile. The one that only the Swamp Lion can give you. I'm going to die, aren't I? It's okay, Dad. You and me, we gotta keep fighting, okay? Okay. Don't tell Mom we... we talked about this. Okay. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams, son. Hey. What are you doing here? I didn't see you at your house. You mean you couldn't get in? Something like that. Come on. I'm making us a lot of money. Your wife must be happy. It's a bad idea. Hey. Hey. - Can you hear me? - Yeah. Yeah. Um, well, it looks like we're getting to come home for the weekend. He's doing better, Jim. He's been eating. Numbers are down. They told us it'd be good for him to come home and see you. He's better? Yeah, he's doing better. Thank you, God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we'll see you soon, all right? All right. - Hey. - Yeah. Love you. Love you. It's been fun. Jack! Hey, Jack. Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Let me see that face. Let me see your face. There it is. - Hey. - Hi. I'm glad you're back. Hmm. I love you. Love you, too. Doctors are happier with the way the treatments are going now. So... I'm sorry I put you through all this hell. Jimmy, I know you're in there. You better take care of that. Jimmy! - Yeah, I'm just gonna... - Just deal with it. Okay? Hi. - What are you doing here? - You're hurting me. They're home. What? Stop it. All right? You need to go home. - Just wanna have a little bit of fun. - You need to go home. They're home. Yeah. So Charlie go home. Yeah, Charlie go home. - Bee, I don't want us to... - Whatever that was, it didn't happen. I don't want to hear about it. All right? All right. Hey, Bee. Welcome home. You know what time it is? Coffee time? Can I just borrow Jim for a bit? - I just want to talk to him for a little bit. - Yeah. Jim. I need to talk to you, brother. Yeah, just let me get my clothes on. - Shit. - Yeah. That's how I found her this morning. Outside the club. Motherfuckers even left the trunk open like that. - What are you gonna do? - What... Shit. I don't know. Came out here to get your help. I ain't never done shit like this before. The fuck am I gonna do? Oh, fuck. There's someone in that truck. Don't look. Don't look. Oh, shit. Fuck, Jim. What the fuck we gonna do now? Oh. You're gonna get in that car and you're gonna get rid of her. We need to make it seem like none of this happened. What about you? I'm going to go to work, do what I usually do. I'm going to get my coffee and my eggs, and I'm gonna head to Houston. You... - Oh, well, you better... - Just get in the car. Come on. All right. All right, big brother. I need you to get up and get dressed. What's going on? I need you to get up and get dressed. - Jim. - Come on. Get up now. Jack? Jack? Hey, buddy. I need you to get up, okay? I need you to get up and get dressed. Get dressed. What is going on? Just listen to me. This is very serious, okay? You need to get out of here now. I want you to take the back road - to the parking garage... - Okay. ...where we hung out when we first met. - You remember? - Yes. Okay. Mom's car is parked on the third floor. - You got it? - Okay. - You got it? - Yes. Shit. Jack... Okay. Stan's bike is right out back, okay? I want you to ride it to that parking garage on Second Street, it's across the river. You know where it's at? - Yes. - This is very important. I need you to go through the park. Okay? You're strong enough? - Yes. - Okay. There's cash under the mat in the car. Okay? Both sides. And don't use credit cards. You gotta use cash. There's money in a PayPal account under your name. It's written on a note under one of the mats in the car. - Okay. - It's written on a note - under one of the mats in the car on the left side. - All right, I got it. - Okay? - Okay. When you get that, you gotta switch accounts. Okay? Open that drawer. - But... - The passports are in that drawer. Shit! You gotta go to Canada, okay? What? When you get there, you tell the police you need protection from the drug lords. It's all on me. You tell them that, okay? Tell the police to contact the hospital about his treatment. Okay, okay. Come here. - You gotta put these on. - It's okay. - Okay, it's okay. - Here, put them on. - Okay? - Here. There. Listen to Mama. All right. You gotta take the red bike. You, go through the park. Okay? Go in opposite directions. You understand that? - Yes. - You understand that? - Yes. - Okay. Okay. - Come here. - What about you? I'm gonna be all right. I'm going to be safe, okay? Okay. Listen. Listen to me, okay? You guys are gonna go out first. And then I'm gonna go out. - Okay. - Okay? - You be safe. - Yes. - Okay? All right. - Okay. - Yeah. - Through the park. All right, let's go. - Okay. - Let's go. Come on, sweetheart. I've got you. Hello. - Hey. - Can I get you something? - Yeah. Please, thank you. - Coffee? Okay. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Appreciate it. - Chorizo? Please. Can I have a strong coffee? Black. Gracias. Black coffee. Anything else, sir? Gracias. Anything else? How is your coffee? I'm sorry. What's that? Your coffee. How is it? It's just fine. Mine's a little thin. Can I taste yours, if you don't mind? It's probably the same coffee. Maybe yours is stronger? Same pot. Too thin. Taste is individual, I guess. Yeah? I don't know. I asked her for a strong coffee, and she brings me this. What does that make her? She probably prefers it on the thin side. But I asked her for something else. From my standpoint, that makes her either a liar, or stupid. Am I right? - Yeah. - Hmm. I'm a businessman. So when I ask for a strong cup of coffee and they bring me this mierda, this shit... it's bad for business... and I don't like it. Okay. Do you know who I am? How do you trust a liar? I can see the white man in your eyes... looking for a solution. White men are always thinking, always... looking for more, always wanting more. It's difficult to be their friend. White men are like birds, long necks, always staring, figuring things out. We Mexicans are like dogs. We bark, fight, fuck. And we love our family. Am I right? I'm not an animal. I'm just... I'm just a father. Bueno. I like to... get everything my way, one way or the other. Okay? I don't like losses. So... we have to find a solution, so you can pay back your debt. I get that. Bueno. There are two kinds of debt. There is the moral debt of the liar. It would be bad for morale if I were to let you just walk away. Wouldn't you say, or do you think that is just a matter of taste? Weak. Strong. No, I don't. You must love your son very much. Hello, Jim. So here's the thing. Your truck is loaded. When you get to the border, they know your truck is loaded. Okay? - All right. - What do you do when they catch you? - Nothing. - I'm right behind you. You wait for me. Don't get any ideas. You do anything, we come for your family. Jack, did anyone follow you? - Mom... - Anyone follow you? Okay, okay. I'm gonna get you in the back. You lay down, okay? Cover yourself up, son. Okay, okay. Okay. Stay down. What about Dad? He's going to meet us later, okay? - Hello? - Hey, they got me, man. - They're gonna pick me up by the Border Patrol. - What? No, no, no. No. If you let them take you, you're dead. You understand? They're gonna kill Bee and Jack if I don't do it. No. If they wanted to kill them, they'd be dead already. It's suicide now. Border Patrol is gonna take you, and they'll pass by you with a huge load, you understand? You need to stop right now. How the hell am I gonna stop? He's right behind me. Right by the border, brother. There's cops all over. They can't touch you if you stop there. You just slow the fuck down. I'll catch up with you, brother. I'm in my car. I'll be there. Just stay down, okay? Okay. Keep that blanket over you, okay? Where are you, man? Right here. I see you now. Right here, man. I see you now. What truck's he driving? It's a Kenworth 0-13. - It's black. - All right. Get ready, pull on over. Just... come on, pull on over. Here he comes. Come here. Can't stay here. You need to keep moving. You guys can't park here. You need to keep moving. Yeah. I know, it just broke down, man. When are you gonna fix it? You gotta keep moving. I'm going to call them right now. But there's no pit stop. Who you gonna call? I'll be out of here in ten minutes, man. Jack, you can get up now. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hold on. Get back down. Can you step out of the vehicle, sir? Why was that, Officer? I didn't do anything wrong. - Get the fuck off the vehicle. - Hold on. Come on, man. - Come here. What're you doing? - Hurry up! Hey, fuck, man. Fuck! Ah, shit, man. Shit, you all right? Hey, hold up, hey! What, are you just... gonna leave us out here like this? All right, come here. Get over here, bud. Back up a little bit. Gosh... Yeah. All right. Get mine... Ah, damn them motherfuckers! Well... what now, brother? Huh? Shit, you got a cigarette? I got a lighter. Oh, man. All right. You know I love you, right? You know I've always loved you? Yeah. Yeah, I have. You've always been a pain in my ass. Yeah, I have. Always loved you, too, bro. All right, you can get up. We're okay.
