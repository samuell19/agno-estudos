CHEERFUL VACATION Sets:, Administration:, Dubbing:, Dubbing Director:, Exteriors: Music: R Ferres "Paella song", "Monuments of Spain" by J. Bizbe Literary script: JM Blay Technical script: A Moreno Dialogues: F Ramos de Castro Artist: A Moreno Director: JM Blay The arrival of summer has closed the studios - - where Garbancito and his comrades in adventure were born. The cartoonists have left, thrilled with joy, but someone is as vigilant as usual. CLOSED FOR STAFF VACATION UNTIL THE 30TH Is Garbancito going to settle for forced stillness for 30 days? We don't think so, and indeed.... Can't we possibly sleep peacefully in this house? - What is wrong with you? - You can see, I'm wary. - Well, I'm on vacation. - On vacation? Yes, on vacation, on vacation. - Hello! - Who's on the line? -Me. - Who's in the studio? - No one. - Then who's "me"? -You are. - No sir, you are "me". The best thing to do is to hang up until he calms down. No, no! This is wrong. I won't settle for 30 days of static and cozy life. And so cozy! I hear a strange noise. Hey! Garbancito has escaped, look at him there. I'll be right over. Well, I'm not staying here. Don't worry, poor thing, I'll take you down. Come on. Climb up, friends, by the telephone wires. It's not a comfortable stair! Man, it may not be comfortable, but it's electric. Colored friends, I gather you to protest against what's happening to us. It's not fair. Me up there, you too, and our friends the cartoonists on vacation. I for my part won't tolerate it because they may be cartoonists, but - - don't we have any saying in it? We'll prove it to them by taking a cheerful vacation. What do you think? - Very well! -Very good! -Great! - But where are we going to go, Garbancito? That's a brave question, Quiriqui, because isn't Spain big and beautiful? As big as it is unknown to many Spaniards. I'm going to distribute the trip. Since Aunt Pelocha has a nephew in Valencia... Yes, son, yes, Vizantico. ... we'll send her to Valencia. Peregrina and I to Seville. Caramanca can travel around Spain in two leaps. What do you think? And now that the 30 days of vacation are over, once again reunited, say, - - what do you think of our country? - Wonderful! Wonderful, yes. Let Chirili and Quiriqui start telling us about their trip. You had a lot of fun, I guess. Speak up, Quiriqui. We're all listening. Whenever you want. Since this girl likes Majorcan sausage very much, we went to Majorca, - - but there was no more Majorcan sausage, no, no. When we left here we went to get a ticket at the Good Shepherd agency, - - and we asked for our place in the queue: - Are you the last one? - Yes, cute one, yes. I've been here since last month and this man has been here for three months. - Hey, hey cab! - Hey cab! A cab? What luck! This is the port, but which one's our ship? Who knows! Unless Christopher Columbus wants to tell us... - With pleasure, poor kids. That one! - Thank you very much, Sir Christopher! - How heavy this luggage is! - What did you think it was, luggage? Run, we're leaving in a hurry. - Goodbye! - Have a good trip! - Bye! Let's take some motion sickness pills, shall we? It's getting really bad, Chirili. Freaky! Hey kids, inside! Hey, Quiriqui, look how small our clothes are getting. Could it be that we're growing up? Hey, Quiriqui, is this a boat or a boogie contest? Why would I tell the waiter that we were going to throw up? I don't know, but I'm going throw up a lot. At dawn we were dazzled by the marvelous view of the bay of Palma. It's not right to call such a beautiful thing a view! Look, the cathedral! When we disembarked we were impressed by the cathedral, all of it made of real stone. Hey, those from Good Shepherd agency, I'm leaving, hurry up everyone. And we crept inside while the luggage was carefully placed. After washing up, we were given forty-two seconds to eat, - - sleep and write to the family. And when I was on the edge of an awesome bed.... Hello, hello. Yes. How awful! Those from Good Shepherd, to the car. Back to the coach to tour Palma. Is there any little room left for me? - Behind, Mrs. Gilda. - Thank you, handsome. It was just a little room and she'd almost throw us all out. But madam, wring that hen's neck. It's a rooster, sir. We saw the City Hall of Palma, with a beautiful coffered ceiling. But for a very nice gift, a pigeon dropped one on my eye. We were also at a very nice Majorcan style patio. And we were amazed by the doors of the cathedral. How beautiful they are! Again in the coach we saw the Cartuja and the Palace of King Don Sancho in passing, - - but the most beautiful thing was the dance, like the sardanas but with other music, - - a Majorcan bolero. Then they danced another dance. None of them was still but they called it "the still". Do you remember when we were to Valdemozar? Where Cho was, Cho... - Don't you remember? - Chocolate! Chopin, silly. And we went to be shown his piano. But there were two of them. Indeed, there are two! But the real one, the real one, I have it. It's a secret, don't tell anyone. Did he eat it? I say that because he has a key in his mouth... We continued in the coach, which by the way was very tiresome. The trip was delightful, but it would have been more so if the car had run less. What a way to devour miles! I thought we were going through an obstacle course, - - but the thing was, whoever got there first, ate first. A gasogen! They didn't get rid of the ashes! It turned white. VISIT MAJORCA MANACOR CAVES And when we arrived in Manacor our car could not hold its chassis. What number do we have to make the caves? Won't you tell me, Quiriqui? One thousand and one. It gives us time to eat. Come on, we'll stuff ourselves with Majorcan sausage, Chirili. Finally you're going to get your whim. Thinking about Majorcan sausage makes my mouth water. - Call soon. - Waiter! - Comming! - What do the gentlemen want? - Majorcan sausage. - It's for export. - Is there any? No, I can get you Catalan sausage, or I can slap you twice - - if you keep asking for Majorcan sausage. How marvelous! What are the verticals on the ceiling called? Stalactites, and the ones on the floor are low-tites. - And why is it called Martel Lake? - Because it's made of cognac. And cognac made us very sleepy. Gentlemen, behold these magnificent views. Because of the speed, the landscape looked like a big paella. We crossed Alcudia! Alcudia it would be, but we saw nothing but trees and dust. Soller. We couldn't see anything, but as Quiriqui - - carried some postcards of those places, we looked at it on the postcard. Pollensa. As you can see, that's a paradise. With Adam and all. And what beautiful colors came out of the water and the rock. If it wasn't so salty you'd want to drink it. Hey, what is that? What could it be? Tomatoes from Banyalbufar, a specialty of this land. There was a lot of tomato there. # What a pleasure, they're on their way here, # they want to see our faces, # they want to see our faces, # let's sing and dance, we are champions of peace. # Let's dance the swaying dance. # Let's sing, let's dance away the night, # you're already here. # Let's dance the tomato dance. # I always prefer to laugh than to cry. # For the moment I feel happy, # the farmer's scissors are out. # With tomato juice I'm running better, # tomatoes cool my engine. # Don't be so anxious. # A frown handkerchief they wear. # Freight to the destination, # this is your obligation. # Rubies envy my color, # and my smell, perfume that transcends. # And there are rumors that dye # with the exquisite inks of roses, # roses of love. Roses of love, # roses of love, roses of love. # There the excursion ended, and when the siren was saying goodbye too, - - we carried the big Majorcan doughnut and said good-bye to Palma de Mallorca - - finally saying goodbye at the famous Bellver Castle. Ah, is it what they call Bellver in the marina, Bellver and hurry up? Don't laugh so much, your head will explode. Now it's your turn, Aunt Pelocha. Here I go. I'll tell you what happened to me in Valencia. What oranges! Big, big as a banker's head. What torches festival programs! There was my nephew Vizantico giving himself more airs than the wind. And above all, what a paella... Wonderful! A paella that even had music. We did a cruel thing because those little octopuses were alive, - - and we ate them alive, - - but the damned took revenge because the nightmare was also awful. We also saw duck hunting in the lagoon. Those who didn't fall from two shots, died from heart attack. Pensat y Fet, Valentian torches festival program! I was watching the ninots (dolls for burning). They looked like flesh and blood people. When I touched one of them to see if it was the mayor of my town, the artist took me for a doll and had I had a hard time avoiding being turned into a torch. Then we walked through the torches. How wonderful! What great artists Valencia has! Well, Miquelet is the Giralda of Valenciana. Finally it was time to light the fireworks. What a mess! All Valencia was a golden ember. Run for your lives! Until it was time to light our torch, - - which I wanted to be the most talked about of Valencia. And it was, because the explosion was heard from Alicante. We became dressed in Adam's fashion and we ended up on the roof. Thank you, thank you. Now it's our turn. What does this one want? Ah, she wants to tell her story. Well, I'm going to tell you about our adventures in Seville. You see, the first thing we saw there, - - the first thing we saw was the Giralda, - - and a bullfight in the Maestranza with the president very constipated, - - because he kept taking out his handkerchief to dry it. We were told that the bullfighters were going to have a stroll, - - but it wasn't true, because they just did the salute, - - they greeted the one with constipation and took off their cape. Then came out the first prize of masks on horseback, - - who could not go home because he had lost his keys. But the one with a cold who had it, threw it to him and it hit him. That was a lot of fun to some guys, - - and they started blowing their trumpet because they were so happy. What a bullfight we saw! There was a bull called Don Berrendo. Hurry, Don Berrendo, to the scene, the bugles have already sounded. Come on, hurry up! Right away. My beloved, my last memory is for you, you milk cow. You're giving me air, you idiot, be quiet! Hey you, if you hide, it's not fair. You go to your own ground without chasing me, that's what's agreed. Else we won't play. You get it? If you're looking for a fight, we're going to have one. Ooolé! Artist! Wow! A horse here? Bad thing. I don't like this one bit. Calm down, calm down. Now you'll see. Horse, horse! Where have I seen this face? Oh, I know, pulling a cart. - Look, bull. - Is it me? Let's see what the one with the sticks wants. What a wretch! Well, he won't leave, not even in a balloon. I'll make crumbs out of him! Spades, spades! - Why are they shouting "Spades", Garbancito? - It must be a cheer. Here's to Garbancito and Peregrina. You don't know me. It must be this one who is the bull's niece, I say. Are you going to make fun of us, baby? Are you talking to us? The weather in Seville is magnificent, but sometimes a few raindrops fall. Finish him off! Come on, maestro! Can't you see that people are leaving? And I've left my raincoat in the room. Watch out, something big is coming. Something big with eyes? The Triana Bridge! Olé my soul, yes, sir, the Triana Bridge. And across it, paradise, the Maria Luisa Park. And now you'll see that in Seville there is love. Come on! If it seems that they are... Here comes Garbancito with Peregrina, boy. Clumsy one, what are you doing there? Waiting for a kettle for three. The best of the land: a party in style. What's this? Let's drink, kids! Let's drink! But with truth and dare, eh? To the health of my dead! That's how you step on the grapes, kid! Now you'll see who I am. # Oh, I went into the cemetery. # - When will he get out of the cemetery? - Who knows. - I do it better. - I feel like crying. Peregrina, are you having fun? And because of so much fun we fell asleep - - just when the chamomile thermometer finished rising. Do you want me to tell you about my adventures? Shut up. Just because you're so big, you're not going to run us over. You have to wait your turn, Caramanca. Well, well, don't get angry. You can start because we have already finished. I didn't know where to go, because as you know the world is a little narrow for me. And I have to walk trying not to make the usual damage. In a couple of strides I stood on the beach of Tossa. What a chance to take a swim, if the water was not too cold. Who said I was afraid? Get out! Get out of there! Come on, fat man, can't you see the town is flooding? - Why don't you swim in the open sea? - Because it's too small for me. I arrived at a village where they were dancing the sardana. There I saw the typical Entregado, and some boys and girls were dancing. - - with epileptic seizures to the sound of music. Slowly, slowly, I arrived at Montserrat. The mountain that is said to have sprung from the bottom of a prehistoric sea. What mountains! Even to me they seemed big. I spent the day looking at everything. The sanctuary of the Moreneta. That facade, with the statues of the apostles and other saints. I never tired of admiring those beautiful things. Then I saw the cells and the cloister of Montserrat, - - which seem embedded in the rocks. There is a rock bigger than my head and harder, - - which they call the rock of the Moorish king, and others with many peaks - - called the needles. Then I was in another rock called the Enchanted Giant. I was enchanted, too. Even more when I saw the viewpoint of San Jerónimo. I climbed it to contemplate all that magnificent scenery. And when I got to the Caval Bernat I got off. ... to meet a human tower made by the Xiquets de Valls. What agility and courage! They go up faster than boiling milk. There I was the king of the couple's festivities - - with a giantess who made me very angry because she was not flesh and blood, - - until I got a nose full of confetti. I let out a sneeze that put an end to the festivities, - - with the Xiquets and with the town. On the way I met a mosquito - - and I decided to follow him to see where he took me. It took me to Madrid, where I entered through the Puerta de Alcalá - - and a small puddle called the Retiro Pond. In front of the Bank of Spain I greeted a lady: - How are you, small one? - Fine, and you, boss? A guard - - who started whistling made me hold the line. So many little windows! Must be a dollhouse. Where could I go to bed tonight, guard? If you don't lie down on the Castellana... Goodbye, boys. You realize, girls? Where's the bearded one going at this hour around here? And the one going by was me. On my way to Asturias I left my size 368 boots tracks. What birds could live in this cage? In the Basque Country I found some guys more my size and habits. From a bridge I saw some dwarfs playing with a little pill. In Bilbao I was at Luciana's and I ate an ostrich thigh for starters. But my greatest success was with the lumberjack competitors. Quiet, boy. Here there is no better axe than me, you'll see. I think I have an opportunity to have fun and earn a few cents. Cheer up, little one, cheer up. Let's see how you manage, we're going to have fun. And as little Sestao was nicer, I decided to protect him. And I succeeded. Blowing at the ball every time it was the opposing player's turn to play. But what the hell is going on here? This is going to be over in a puff. I'm a little tired. If I could just find a place to sleep for a while... Nice mattress. And when I was sleeping something tremendous happened. I heard some trilling and something came out of the ground. It was the Penicillin fungus. Quiet, the giant is sleeping. Silence everyone, the giant Caramanca is sleeping. # Caramanca fell asleep # and the dream was a happy one. # We must be careful not to go near his nose... # because he gets a gale # that looks like a blowfly... # He warns us: # Oh, what a laugh, what a way to dream! # It's a trombone, the belly guy! # How beautiful they are for dancing. # Caramanca the giant, he sleeps, # he snores with eagerness. # His nose is the mailbox # that sends out the hurricane. # And his huge belly, oh, what a laugh! # What a laugh, oh, what a laugh! # What a way to dream! # I had finished my adventures and returned home. And these guys? Where did they go? Well, who knows? I went with them by plane. How high we fly! These must be the boys who are going to collect the hidden treasure. We passed the Strait of Gibraltar and arrived in Africa, - - where something terrible happened to us. Get ready, we have to seize them as soon as they get careless. We must not lose sight of them. You see? Also in these stores there's everything. And it's all very nice. Why are the doors shaped like that? Will you tell me? Well, I don't know, really. Ah, yes! For that to fit through. Now I understand everything. How strange! Look at that. You'll see how I can do it too. Be careful, they'll see you. Hey, my friend. They'll have to pay us overtime. Or finance it? We're left without Father Pelanas. Be forewarned and to them. It's completely useless for you to deny it. I am well aware that you know where your uncle's treasure is buried. You will tell or you won't get out of here. Oh, what an guy! What a scolding he's giving us. You have an hour to think it over or to make your will. That's it! You'll stay here and it will be useless to try to escape. You are warned. - We know nothing. - We are innocent. Did your uncle have any treasure? - My uncle had nothing but rheumatism. - Well, it won't be your uncle. Peregrina, we must rescue our friends. I don't trust those guys with the beards. Wait for me here. There's shouting. A guy uglier than sin was beating up a little black guy. You rascal, you rascal! Scoundrel! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Go get him, Peregrina! That's it, Peregrina! Wonderful. - Who are you? - They call me Carbonilla. Run, run! Carbonilla, you have to help me look for three friends who got lost. They must be here somewhere. I think I heard gunshots. Are these people crazy, Carbonilla? Don't panic. What they're doing is burning gunpowder for fun. - They're fighters. - No, it's called fantasy. Think, think, Carbonilla. What would we do to save my comrades? - I don't know. - Well, we must think of something to save them. - Who's that? - That's Ambrosio, the leader of the caravans. Garbancito! Garbancito! - Who's that? - It seems I've been called. Garbancito! Yes, they called me. Let's follow Ambrosio's caravan. Come with me and don't be afraid of anything, I'm very brave. We'd better first get my donkey, don't you think? Or get the Cid's horse. And riding the donkey we decided to follow the mysterious caravan. Will we find a way through here, Carbonilla? At least the passage for the camel. Alms for a poor lion out of work. Here, brother, in case you're from the congress. Thank you, thank you, thank you. What's wrong with this guy? I don't know, he's just a scaredy-cat who's always scared. - Look, there's smoke coming out of that house. - It must be the bookstore. - They're probably there. We have to save them. - Of course. Carbonilla, I've got a bright idea. - Have you? - We must put it to work. I'll ask the dragonfly for help, there's no friend too little. - It's gone. - Hey. Wait. Come, don't go. If you don't hurt me I'll help you. Me and all of us. Since you've flown here, I want you to say hello to us. Hey, dragonfly! For the last time I ask you to reveal the place where the treasure is hidden... - - or you will die like rats, in terrible torments. Speak, if you want to save your lives. Reveal the secret of the treasure. No, no, no, we know nothing. There are three of us. But what is this? What is this? Watch out! Ahhh. The attack of the dragonflies was awesome. Eight, nine, ten, dragonflies win by knockout. The traitors continued to be chased by the remorse that swelled in their conscience. We never saw them again. Don't be afraid, my friends, we are here. By risking your lives we have driven out the enemy, you are free. Thank you, thank God. As we looked out into the desert, I felt the torture of thirst, - - and I suffered a terrible mirage. In the very place, it seemed to me that a crystalline fountain was gushing, - - I bent down to drink and the fountain mocked at me. I pretended to look the other way to deceive it but it was useless. After all my attempts the fake fountain won over me easily. I went back to Carbonilla. - I'm so sorry, Garbancito. - Thank you, Carbonilla. In Spain this wouldn't happen to us, there everything is true: - - the water, the flowers, the birds, the monuments. I'm going to offer you the mirage of the beauties of Spain. - I would like to see them. - Well, get excited and look. We'll start with... with whatever; it's all the same. Because in Spain, everything is simply wonderful. That's from Santiago de Compostela, - - a historic city in Galicia where it rains from time to time. Another of our great monuments. Take a good look at it. The Poblet Monastery - - nested in the Catalan region. There you go, Carbonilla, this beautiful cathedral is the one in Segovia. The bridge has so many eyes so to see it better. This is the Alhambra in Granada. I think your grandmother or a relative of yours lived here. What a house, eh! What a house, boy, what a house! Here we have the Royal Palace of Madrid. We are seeing it from a bird's eye view. You can't deny... - - that it's simply marvelous. This other one is the work, the great work of Philip II, - - the Royal Monastery of El Escorial, - - considered, quite rightly by the way, - - as the eighth wonder of the world. This is the aqueduct of Segovia, a work like those of the Romans. Some say that the devil built it in one night, - - but don't be scared, Carbonilla, I don't believe it. Delight yourself... - - delight yourself now before the Cathedral of Burgos. So that you see, my friend Carbonilla, that in Spain, - - in Spain they also make lace with stone. These are the so-called Tower of Quart, - - the most famous of the beautiful Valencia, the queen of the Turia. How do you like that? Another of your people's great creations in Spain. I believe you have heard of the Mosque of Cordoba. Did my grandmother live there too? Not your grandmother, but surely your great-great-grandmother. Now, now we contemplate the wall and the gate of Avila, - - we have recently restored them, which means that they are brand new. A historic castle, the castle of Copa, - - where very remarkable events took place that I would gladly explain to you, - - if I had not flunked history. A detail of Ronda, in Malaga. Ronda is famous for its antiquity and its bullfighters. Not for its bandits, which we have only for export. In reality they do not exist. And we return to Segovia. Here you have its famous Alcazar. Do you like it, Carbonilla? As you can see, the whole of Spain is wonderful. - Great, all this is wonderful. - Cheer up and come, will you? Shame, I would gladly go but I have no money. Anyway, we'll end up in the plates in the studio. - We will? - Yes, of course. And that's all, gentlemen. Why don't we run away for good? It would be the best thing. Shut up, shut up. It can't be. Everyone has told his own story. I don't want them to catch us unprepared. Watch out, Peregrina, because the cartoonists are about to arrive. Everyone, keep an eye out. This is over, gentlemen. Not even another week, Garbancito? No, no, no, no, no. Not even another minute. We're sorry, but what can we do? Me more than anyone else. Hurry everybody to your places!
