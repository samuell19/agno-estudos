Did you, Jeff? - Well, ladies, you know I never play these games. - Dude, come on, Jeff. I'll do anything that you ask me to. Anything. - Please, girls, I can't. I have to keep my relationship with the clientele on a, uh, professional level. Excuse me. But I've got a couple of free tokens for the Miner Tower, and maybe a little later I'll come by, take a little peek over your shoulders, see how you're doin', okay? Hey, now this is an exciting offer, isn't it, guys? I mean, a free drink doesn't happen every day. - Jefferson, are these yours? - "I belong to Eugene Groebe." Well, his pants are here.

I'm sorry, but you're not allowed to have food on the games. (blooping) - No one's ever gotten seven figures on this machine before. Not even me. I don't think this machine's capable of seven figures. - Well, I'm sorry about that, but I work here now, and I find your appearance highly objectionable. I suggest that you just trot on out of here and come back when you're in better condition to play the game. - Let's you and me see what's inside this, okay?

You, you can't do that! - [Gamer] Watch me. - [Eugene] I am just gonna go get Mr. Jefferson Bailey, is what I'm gonna do. - Yeah, you do that.

We know what you thought, but I'm gonna introduce you to Jonathan Andrew McDorfus. - Hey, kid. - Hi. - Eugene, you must remember Dorfus. See, he graduated last year with me at school. He was our senior class president. - You're kidding? He was the senior class president last year? He didn't look anything like this. What happened? - Games, kid. Video games.

You're just a punk kid. - Uh, my grandfather's the owner, and he's out of town, so, in his absence, I have complete power and authority, and I am certain that I can assist you. - Don't feed me that bullshit, kid.

Connie and I were, like, gonna go shopping at the Banarama. Can I have some Billies then? - Pardon? - You know, I think you called it lettuce once. Or was it cabbage? - All right, all right, uh. - At least I didn't take your plastic, God. - All right, now, Patsy, we have an understanding. You will not go to the arcade again, right? - Daddy. If I want to go to the arcade, like, I am going to go, okay? (splashing) (squishing) - Oh, Jeff! Dorfus! Oh my goodness, thank goodness you're here.

One way or the other, I'm gonna close that place down. - God, Daddy, it's like you are so edged, it's like you are turning totally edged. If you would, like, listen to me, in time I could explain to you that Jeff Bailey is like a totally bitchin' guy. And I wanted to-- - Now, look. - God! Bunch of crisp-os. - Look, young lady, you're not too old to tan anymore. And don't talk about your lamebrain cousins that way either.

Dorfus, play the game. (cackling) Play the game, Dorfus. Come on, God! Dorfus, watch out! You're about to be hit, Dorfus. - [King Vid] Yeah! - [Jeff] Dorfus. (chuckling) Dorfus, come on, here's your second man. Now come on, Dorfus. (beeping and blooping) Dorfus, play the game. (beeping and blooping) - [King Vid] Yeah, yeah! This Dorfus, is for you. (chuckling) - [Jeff] We're gonna do this. Come on, we gotta win. Come on, Dorfus, get goin'. - [King Vid] Oh yeah! (rumbling and beeping) Great, great! - Dorfus, what are you doing? (beeping) - You're down to your last man, Dorfus! (blooping) - [Jeff] There's only one man left. What are you doing, Dorfus? Dorfus, come on, there's only one left. Come on! - What's he doing? (laughs) Too bad, Dorfus, too bad! - I lost my candy bar. Oh, there's your man. (beeping) (screams) - [Woman] All right! (dramatic pop music) - [Jeff] Yeah, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, Dorfus. (people shouting and chattering) (thumping pop music) - [Crowd] Go, go! (thumping pop music) - Go, go, go, go, go! (crowd shouting and chattering) - [Jeff] Come on, Dor-Man. Come on, time it. (chortling) (beeping and blooping) - [Man] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Go, Dorfus, go! (crowd cheers and shouts) (beeping and blooping) - Dorfus, you won. Hey, Dorfus. Dorfus, you can stop now. Hey, Dorfus, it's only a game. Come on. - No, no, Jeff. It's not just a game. To Dorfus, playing video games is like eating or sleeping, breathing, things that we take for granted and never question. You ask Dorfus to stop and you don't realize that for him to give up would be for him to give up on the very impulse that allows his heart to continue beating, the blood to surge through his veins, and the air to fill through his lungs. (rhythmic pop music) - God, Eugene, you're makin' me sick to my stomach. (rhythmic pop music) - You have just witnessed a true champion. God. - [Dorfus] Sorry you lost, but maybe you should color your hair. - Hey, hey, look, Vidiot, uh, you can stay, but, uh, no trouble, promise? - Hey, man, a Vidiot never promises nothin' to no one! (rapid rock music) - Oh no. - Uh oh. - Patsy, I thought I told you you couldn't come here anymore. - Yeah, but, Daddy, that was, like, to the video arcade. This isn't a video arcade. It's like a party in the middle of the night after the arcade, so this is like the party atmosphere. - Bailey, you've gone too far this time. You have no right to keep this business open this late at night. - We are not open for business, Rutter. This is a private party. - Yeah, Daddy, and no offense, but you weren't on the invite list. Way to rude. - Look, you're taking blatant advantage of these minors. I mean, look around, how these young girls are dressed. - Ooh, yeah. And I know each and every one personally, so if you're interested, let me know which one and I'll fix ya up with 'em. - Look, I've had just about enough of you for one night, young man. - I want you outta here, Rutter. This is a private gathering. - Yeah, I'm leaving, but you haven't heard the last of me yet. (rapid rock music) - It's a stupid idea about stealin' those games and rentin' a truck. - Shut up, Max, shut up, shut up, shut up! (rapid rock music) (gum bubble pops) - Come here! (beeping and blooping) I want you two to arrange a spontaneous public demonstration outside this arcade tomorrow afternoon. - That's a good idea, Uncle Joesph. - [Joe] Yeah, well don't screw this one up. - Uncle Joseph, that reminds me, uh, we screwed it up with the truck tonight, and we're gonna pick up the tab. I got the receipt right here. So don't worry. We're gonna take care of it personally. - This is Alexis Wheeler speaking to you live from Bailey's Video Arcade. We're in the middle of a spontaneous demonstration to close down the arcade. We have a special interview for you with this gentleman over here. Excuse me. Your name, sir? - Uh, Joesph Rutter. Rutter Enterprises, right here in River City. - Mr. Rutter, do you have anything to do with this demonstration? - Well no, ma'am, I came here as a shocked parent, a concerned parent who cares very deeply about all the children of this community. You know, what takes place here, day after day, stands as a testament to the rotting moral decay of our society. - Rutter was determined to close us down from the moment he walked into this place. - The man's a driven asshole. - No, no, you don't see what I mean. He was there when Alva and Lola ran out with their tops off. He thinks we're running a bordello. - Bordello? - Bordello? - Yes, you should've seen the expression on the druggist's face when I picked up these slides this morning. Look at this. - What, what have you got there? - And so, at the video arcade, with one very angry and frustrated parent, this is Alexis Wheeler, Channel Six, Up To the Minute News. - All right. Uh, I got an idea. Alexis. - This is Alexis Wheeler speaking to you poolside at the home of Mr. Joseph Rutter, who is conducting the campaign in this city to close down the video arcade. Mr. Rutter, thank you for allowing us into your home. Could you reiterate to our audience what it is you plan to accomplish? - Now we have a contingency of parents, uh, demonstrating in front of the arcade now, and we will continue to do so until Mayor Neville calls a special meeting of the City Council to discuss this issue specifically, and it has to be done soon, before anymore harm to our children is done. - [Alexis] Uh, have you, in fact, ever gone to the video arcade? - Haven't I made myself clear, lady? That damn video arcade is nothing but a breeding ground for decadent and antisocial behavior. - That's interesting, Mr. Rutter. Uh, speaking of antisocial behavior, I have photographic evidence of you at the arcade with two semi-nude girls in your arms. - What, what is this? Is this a set-up or somethin'? I mean who do you think you are, Mike Wallace or Howard Cosell or somethin', huh? - [Alexis] Are you aware of the photograph of which I speak? - I have no idea of what you are talking about. Do you have that photograph with you? - No. - Well sure. - Uh, but I do know where it can be found. - Uh, yeah, well this is the worst example of shoddy journalism I have ever seen. - I don't know, I thought it was a pretty good example of shoddy journalism. - No further comment, thank you. - Uh, no, Mr. Rutter, we're not quite through. We have a few more questions, uh. - Sorry, no. - Get them off my property! - Uh-- - If Uncle Joseph says it's over, it's over. - All we have to do now is wait for his call. - We got him this time. ♫ Love ♫ Is a moment ♫ Like a wave - Hey, I thought you said you were comin' alone. - These guys don't count. You got the photographs like we agreed? - Yeah, but there's somethin' I want you to understand, Rutter. - Two things, I want the photo and I want you to tell that lady journalist that photo was a phony. - You can have it. But you gotta promise that you'll leave this arcade alone and that you'll drop those stupid charges. - I promised you that on the phone, didn't I? Now where's the photo? - It's right over here behind the bar. Hey, hey, these guys are a little impatient, aren't they? - Well, I want that photograph. - Okay now, here's what you're lookin' for, but, uh, first I want you to sign this simple agreement. It's nothing complicated. Just simply reaffirms our understanding. - Uh uh, I gave you my word. - I'm sorry, Rutter, but that's just not quite good enough. Hey! - Have you got the photograph? Fine, let's go. (Eugene growls) Let's go. (Arnie barks) (beeping) - Excuse me. Excuse me, all demonstrators. If you come up here and turn in your picket signs, you'll get one free token. That's right, right up here by the snack bar. Come on. - Close the arcade! Close the arcade! - Close the arcade! - What's goin' on here? Where are the demonstrators? - It's not our fault, Uncle Joesph. - Yeah, Uncle Joseph, we've been outsmarted. - This is our place. What are all these old dudes doin' here, hangin' out, takin' up all our games? - This place is open to the public. I can't determine who comes in here and plays these games. - How could you let this happen? - Oh, man, you sold out! You really sold out to the max, man! - Okay, Vidiot, outta here right now! - Hey, you don't have to tell us to leave! We're on our way outta here anyway. We don't wanna hang in your crummy joint! Come on! (shouting) (banging) - Uh, excuse me. - Yeah, what do you want? - Uh, could you take me to your leader? - The name's King Vidiot. These are my subjects. Hey, uh, have you got a sister? - Me, no, no, I. - It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. My card. - Not impressed. - Well that's too bad 'cause I think we're on the same side. However, if you decide you need, uh, help with our young friend Mr. Bailey in there, gimme a call. (gentle instrumental music) What the hell are you doin' here? - You said you wanted to talk. - I meant my office. - I don't like offices. - Why didn't you use the door? - I don't like doors. - Very well, Mr. Vidiot, have a seat. - I don't like seats. And that's another thing, the name is King Vidiot! Not Mr. Vidiot. You can call me Your Highness if you like. - You and I have something in common. Do you know what that is? - We both like to hang out in public bathrooms. - No! We both hate that arcade. - Wait a minute, man. I love the arcade. - Then let me put it another way. Uh, we both hate Jefferson Bailey. Now I saw him kick you outta there last night, and if you're half the leader I think you are-- - I am half the leader you think I am. - You'd like some revenge. - Yeah. Revenge. Sure. Revenge. (crunching) Revenge is sweet! - I tell ya what, you help me force Jefferson Bailey out of business, and I'll buy you your own video game. If you're dyin', I'm not gonna give you mouth-to-mouth. (gentle instrumental music) - You mean my very own machine? - Yeah. - Nobody else could touch it? - No. - What I gotta do? - I want a major disturbance at the arcade. - Oh we, man, we do that all the time. - Yeah, but I want a special one. I've got to force the mayor to move. - Yeah, yeah, like, uh, like, uh, uh, breakin' some bones. - Oh yeah. - [King Vid] Revenge. Oh, man, what if we was to have some wheels? - Some wheels? - Yeah! Wheels. (engine revs) Vidiots! Yeah! (laughing) - Yeah! - Vidiots, Vidiots, Visiots! Wheels! Wheels! Yeah! Wheels! (engine revs) (pounding rock music) (grunting) - Hello, operator? Quick, get me the police. This is an emergency! - This is Alexis Wheeler reporting to you from the video arcade, where violence has just erupted. (people chattering) Mr. Rutter, were you a witness to what happened here today? - I have nothing to say to you. Unless, of course, you're here to apologize for your scurrilous accusations. - I have nothing to apologize about. But I will admit that with the violence here today, the mayor is gonna really have a problem with everything that's been going on. - Thanks for the wheels, man. Hi, Mom. - Uh, what did that young man mean? - I have no idea. He's just another one of these lunatics from this asylum. What'd you start to say about the mayor? - I was only suggesting that the mayor will more than likely wanna call a meeting to discuss everything-- - You heard it, folks. Straight from Alexis Wheeler. The mayor's calling a special emergency meeting to shut this video arcade down. - I never said such a thing. I never-- - Uh, thank you. - Give me back my microphone. (gavel bangs) (people chattering) - There will be order in this room. That's better. We'll now proceed with the opening statements. Uh, Mr. Rutter. - Mr. Mayor, councilmen, concerned parents, children. (booing) (thumping rock music) (gavel bangs) - Uh, Mr. Rutter, would you go ahead? - Thank you, uh, Mr. Mayor. As you know, we are here to extinguish the filth and the decadence that is commonly referred to as video game entertainment. Fortunately, here in River City, the problem is isolated, though no less threatening. The trouble, right here in River City, is Bailey's Video Arcade. - Yeah! - All right! (crowd chatters) (booing) - [Man] Throw him out! (booing) - [Mayor] Mr. Bailey, do you care to make some opening remarks? - You mean, uh, other than to say that the honorable Mr. Joseph Rutter is full of shit. - What? Heel! (beeping) - What are some of the signs of this video madness? What should a concerned parent look for? - A large semicircle of calluses here along the ridge between the thumb and the forefinger. One should also look for Pac-Man arthritis or the Blinky syndrome, which manifests itself in the lower forearm and wrist of the playing hand, the hand that holds the, uh, joystick. (crowd laughs) - Is there anything else you have observed? - Germs. - Germs, Nurse Tubitt? - Kids play with their joysticks day in and day out. Jerking them back and forth, sweating on them, and they don't even clean them off when they're through. (crowd laughs) Their joysticks are a hotbed of germs! Germs! (beeping) - Well, as it turns out, most of my boys are spending all their time with these damn video games. Why, they're addicted to them. It, it's worse than dope or booze or even women. And it takes their drive away, like self-abuse. (beeping) - If you were to summarize the effect the video arcade has had on you, what would you say? - Oh, you mean like in, uh, 25 words or less? Uh. The video arcade has made me what I am today. (cheering and clapping) - [Man] Whoo, all right! - What's the matter, that was less than 25 words! (beeping) - I hoped to convey the very specific, easily discernible damages done by the video arcade. I would be remiss in my responsibilities as spokesman for this cause without trying to express to you the frightfully immoral nature of the arcade ambiance itself. As soon as you walk through the door, you are hit by the stench of the filth that covers the premises. - She's 16, she's beautiful. She's ready for action. What am I bid? - [Patsy] Oh, Jeff, Jeff, my body is mega entranced, restless, and abandoned to be as one with you. - I'm sorry, Patsy, I'm busy! You'll have to go elsewhere for your sexual gratification. - Oh, Jeff, why are you always so awesome! - Go. - [Woman] Oh, baby, baby, baby. (laughing and moaning) - [Patsy] Oh how long is the line? - [Max] It said 15 minutes but it's always longer. This is my fourth time today, and I'm going pee a dozen. - Number 69, number 69. You know the rules, Candy. I do the touching. (groaning) - [Dorfus] Oh, pretty, pretty. (laughing and moaning) (fire crackles) - And so, in conclusion, I hope you can all see the urgent need to close this place down as quickly and as efficiently as possible. (beeping) - Now I have listened very carefully to Mr. Rutter as I'm sure most of us have. Now I would like to tell you the truth. That the video arcade is quite a different place than from what my esteemed opponent has described. Children of all ages are welcome at the video arcade. Now today, class, we will continue our lesson in computer science. - Mr. Bailey, I want you to know that your lessons have been very instrumental in getting me into college. - That's right, sir, especially your lessons on your private computer. - I like milk. It's very nutritious. I'm drinking milk for good. (glasses clink) (gentle instrumental music) - Oh, I'm sorry, Eugene, I accidentally rubbed my breast up against you. - No harm done, Candy. (gentle instrumental music) - Cardinal Dorfus, these are excellent hit dogs and bens, the best I've ever had. - Thank you, Your Holiness, but it's hot dog and beans. - Yes, of course. (Dorfus farts) Cardinal Dorfus, do you smell something? - Why, no, Your Holiness, I, I do not. - Well, never mind. - Remember, Your Holiness, the words of the apostle Paul. He who smelt it first, hath dealt it first. - Yes, that is as it should be. - Ah! (beeping) (clapping) - [Man] Woo, all right! - I would be wholly remiss in my duties if I didn't call one very special witness to the stand. That is, of course, if I have the approval of Mr. Rutter. - It's a free country. - Patsy Rutter. - [Joesph] Huh? (cheering and clapping) (beeping) - Now in your own words, would you please tell the Council how you feel about the video arcade? - Okay! Like where are we supposed to go? Sure, there's the galleria, and there's, like, going to the movies and everything, or going to 7-11 after school for stuff, but, like, that's totally it. Jeff Bailey's Video Arcade is the only place to go for good clean fun. - Good clean fun? My God, Patsy, are you crazy? My God, that place is slime and pure unadulterated slime and immoralist slime! Slime! (crowd chattering) What? (crowd chattering) - Well, thank you, Mr. Rutter, for very nicely leading me into my next point about immorality as we see it today. Ladies and gentlemen, as a way of clearing up Mr. Rutter's definition of immoral slime, watch this. (beeping) (shouting and chattering) (beeping) - My God, Max, you said you got that photo! - [Max] I did, it's right here! - May I please have Eugene's photo back? And in conclusion, as for the video arcade being a threat to the community, I'll tell ya that until my grandfather and I opened the arcade, these kids never felt that they belonged to a community at all. At the arcade, the kids belong. (cheering and shouting) - [Mayor] That slide obviously proves it as a personal matter. (crowd chattering) - Your Honor, no city ordinances were broken. I don't see how you could possibly close this arcade. (gavel bangs) - This Council of River City concludes that, eh, no laws have been broken at the arcade, so we, we can find no evidence to warrant its closing. (shouting and clapping) (gavel bangs) As long as you don't break any laws. (crowd chatters) Let's get the hell outta here. - Patsy! You best go home now, darling. Well, congratulations, young Mr. Bailey, you did quite well in here. - Well, thank you, Rutter, that's uh, very sportsmanlike of you. - Suppose you think you've got this thing won, huh? - You heard what the mayor said. As long as we keep things within the law. - Well I suppose you'd be interested to see what my two nephews here have found in the kitchen of your snack bar. - [Dorfus] You're just not gonna give up, are ya, Rutter? - Why you son of a-- - No, no, just wait a minute! - What? - Um, well I just had an idea, that's all. I thought that maybe we could settle this like gentlemen. - [Dorfus] What, are you crazy, Eugene, or hit your head on somethin'? - No. It's just that last time we had a disagreement, we played a game at the arcade, and the winner of the game decides. - This little wimp speak for you? - Yeah, this little wimp speaks for me, and I challenge you to a game. My man against any man you choose. If you win, I'll close the arcade down. But if I win, you leave the arcade the hell alone. - You know my man, His Highness King Vidiot! - Yeah, and my man is Jonathan McDorfus. - Okay. This time, we play my game, Super-Pac! - Piece of cake. - Ha! - Ha! - Ha! - Ha! - Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. (humming) - Well, it's all settled then. Shall we say, uh, nine o'clock in the morning? - No, make it 11, Rutter! I gotta eat my breakfast first. - Okay, calm down, Dorfman. You're in training. - All right, you two know what to do now, huh? You sure you know where that slob kid lives? (beeping) Well, well, kid, what do ya say, huh? - What are you doin'? - Where's your man? - Dorfus, he's around. - No, he's not around-- - Shh. Excuse me, sir, private conversation, thank you. - Yeah, sure. - What's wrong? - He's not at home, and the guy at the hot dog stand next door hasn't seen him since last night. - Not since last night? - No. - Your Highness. Tell ya what, kid, it's put up or shut up time. You gonna forfeit? - Hell I am, I'll just choose someone else to play. - I'll tell you what, Bailey, you're so smart, I'll play you. - No, that's not the deal. - That's right. Besides, idiot, you know I never play these games. - Never play these games, sure, you never play these games. - That's right, so it wouldn't be fair, so I'll just choose someone else to play. - Is he shittin' me? - No. Everybody knows Bailey doesn't play video games. He's a regular chicken. (clucks) - I'll tell ya what, Bailey, uh, let's sweeten the pot a little bit here, huh? I'll let you play but you've gotta promise that if you lose this match, you'll not only shut this arcade down, you'll never open another arcade here in River City, huh? - All right, you've got it. But you've gotta give me 15 minutes. - You got it. (laughing) - I think there's something I should tell you. - Yeah? - Well, you know the reason why I never play these games? - No. - Well, they, they make me physically ill. - [Eugene] What? - Yeah. I mean, every time I look into one of those screens, I get dizzy and I-- - Jeff? Are you okay? - Yeah. - I mean, you looked a little weird. - No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's cool, thanks. - Oh. - Jeff, you must be shitting me. - No, Eugene, I wouldn't shit you at a time like this. - But why? Why, Jeff, why do you get so dizzy? I know, I'll run and get some Dramamine. - Eugene, that is not gonna help. I guess I better tell ya the whole story. It all started, Eugene, because I loved video games. And I guess that's why Dorfus and I became so close. I mean, we'd play each other, and sometimes he'd win, and sometimes I'd win, and. - Gosh, you must be really good. - I was, Eugene, was. Anyhow, about six months ago, I convinced my grandfather to turn the warehouse into the arcade We had a fantastic grand opening. And after we were closed, my girlfriend and I, Sandy, we kinda hung around a while, you know, and. God, it was wonderful, Eugene. We were so in love. And it was the, uh, first time for both of us. Everything was just perfect. ♫ Love ♫ Is a moment ♫ Like a wave ♫ Lost in the ocean ♫ Calm ♫ So deceptive ♫ Like the storm ♫ She's expectin' ♫ Oh I ♫ Never ever felt this good before ♫ You ♫ Never ever thought I could before ♫ You ♫ Sailed into my life ♫ And said hello ♫ On a Sunday Everything was wonderful. Until I looked into a video screen and there was the reflection of her father. Eugene, it was awful. He started slapping her. (romantic pop music) - What happened then? - They moved outta town and I haven't seen her since. And now every time I look into one of those screens, I see the reflection of her father. And I haven't played those games since. - I'll help ya, Jeff. You gotta come through this. Everybody out there's depending on you. - You gonna help me, Eugene? - You can count on me, Jeff. (staccato instrumental music) Make sure at least three monsters (speaker fades out). You only have a limited number. Use them sparingly (speaker fades out). The energizers earned in Pac-Man are what spinach is to Popeye. Never hesitate moving the Pac-Man. Hesitation can be more harmful than the monsters. Courage is one of four ways to stop hesitation. The other three are practice, practice, practice! Go on, Jeff, do it, you can do it. Just look at it. - Eugene, I know you're tryin', but I can't-- - Jeff, Jeff. - I don't think I can do it. Eugene-- - This is the grandfather of all Pac-Man games. This is where it all started. No, you've gotta do it. You don't have much time. (dramatic instrumental music) - What happened? - Nothing. - Where was I? - Okay, it's time to go to the joystick. - Oh no, Eugene, I don't think I can do it. - Come on, Bailey, get up there and do it. Come on, it's got a maze, it'll be fun. No, man. It's the same thing as a maze. Go, man. That's it, up, now dodge, faster, faster. (dramatic instrumental music) Perfect, go! It's just like Super-Pac except she's a striptease artist. Go! - Okay, Eugene, it's comin' back. Yeah, okay. I feel it. - Go, fast, dodge, dodge! Dodge, dodge! - Yeah. (dramatic instrumental music) The mo's workin', Eugene. Yeah. Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Yeah. Okay, Eugene. - Got it? - Let's go! (shouting) (dramatic instrumental music) Yeah, we got it! Go, go! (dramatic instrumental music) (crowd chattering) Yeah. - Yeah! - Okay, Eugene. All right, Eugene, I got the momentum. - The big mo. - The big mo is workin'. All right, all right, all right. Vidiot, I am ready. - You had better be. - Okay, if everyone will, like, just bag the noise, okay? Like we can do this. Okay, players on their marks, get set, start game! (blooping) - [Man] Come on, come on, Jeff. - [Woman] Let's go. Come on, come on. - Get that power pellet. - Come on. - [King Vid] Ain't nothin' gonna save you now, Bailey. - [Eugene] Come on, Jeff, concentrate. Big mo, big mo. - [Jeff] Come on, help me, please. Come on. On no, no. Oh no, this can't be happening. This can't be happening. - Jeff! - God, what am I doing? What am I doing? (blooping) Find Dorfus. (crunching) - [Max] Oh God, Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe's gonna freak. Oh God. - Max, you know, I smell somethin' fishy. This shithead's not goin' anywhere. Why don't you and me go down to the arcade and see if everything's all right with Uncle Joe? We'll be right back. Oh yeah. - [Man On TV] Put it all on the table. (comedic instrumental music) And, uh, why is he, why is he comin' after me like that? (grunting) He's a big guy. (muffled shouting) Al, what are you doin'? (Dorfus farts wetly) - Oh. (comedic instrumental music) (Dorfus farts explosively) (Dorfus farts wetly) (shouts) My prayers have been answered. Oh! Oh God! Oh, take me! Take all of me! - [Woman] Move it, move it. - Man, this is cake. - No. - Jeff, I can't find him anywhere, but don't worry, just remember the big mo. (beeping) - [Jeff] Help. Help. - Come on. Come on. (laughing) Donuts, donuts! Gimme 'em! Ain't nothin' gonna help you now, Jefferson. - That's all right. Forget about the past. Just concentrate now. Do it now. ♫ We can get a video high ♫ Just keep those quarters comin' ♫ We'll play till the day we die ♫ 'Cause we are ♫ Video video video Jeff, the mayor! - Oh shit. Okay, Eugene, you're the new assistant manager. I want you to go talk to him, PR him, schmooze him. - Okay. - Do it. ♫ Video vidiots (beeping) ♫ Video video video - Mayor Neville, hi. I'm Eugene Groebe. Uh, the assistant manager here at the establishment. - I see. - Yeah, can I help you? - Uh, no, no, thank you, Eugene. I just thought I'd come down here and have a cordial look around for myself. - Yes, well, then as a way of making you feel welcome, can I present you with some complimentary tokens so you can play the games? - Oh, these games, me play these games? No, no, no, no, no. I, I don't think so, Eugene. - Oh come on, give it a try. You're only young once. Uh, there, play Gorf. It's easy. Here's your token. - [Mayor] Uh, what's that for? - [Eugene] Well we use those instead of quarters. Put it in the slot right there. - Uh huh. Now what do I do? - Oh, press start. - Press start. - [Eugene] And try and not get blasted by these ships. - Mm hmm. What, what happened? - You got blasted by the ships. - Oh, I did, did I? Well they can't do that to me. We'll just see about that. Let me try again. What do I do, what do I do? - Hold on to the joystick there and, that's it, and then just dodge. Yeah, yeah. Now with your index finger, you can shoot. And there ya go. All right. (Mayor chuckles) ♫ Video video video - [Man] Come on! Come on, Jeff, go, go! - Oh please help me. Come on, you can do it. - What's the matter, Bailey? (laughs) Come on. Wait a minute. (Vid laughs) - If, if you'll untie me, we can prepare for a marathon experience unlike anything you've had before. - Oh, this is unlike anything I've had before. - Yes, yes, but, but what I'm talking about is your wildest fantasies come to life. (Vivian moans) We'll meet again tonight. - Oh! - And I will have other young, strong bodies with me. - Oh! - Yes, and even, even some, I know you're not gonna believe this, better than I. - Better than you? - Yes. Yes, there, there are some out there. Few, few, but they're there, and they'll be with me tonight.

Now, Dorfus, help, help. - I am Jeff's friend, but don't you want me to save the arcade? - Of course I do, but I just think it's more important that we make Jeff face his problems.
