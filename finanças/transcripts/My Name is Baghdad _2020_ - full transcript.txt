Come on dude, a hot chick like that. Even I would. Pay attention, Deco. He’s your friend, you pay attention. You guys are awful. You don’t even know her and the first thing you say is that’s she’s hot. She probably does a lot of cool things that you don’t even know about, and you just say that she’s hot. Is that all? Are you jealous? Jealous? Relax, Baghdad. It was just a compliment. What compliment? You treat her like a piece of meat, and you think that’s ok? Don’t be mad, Baghdad. You know that you’re my muse. Baghdad. My bad. Fuck off. Sorry about the muse thing. I meant that you’re charming. I don’t want to talk to you, Clever. Let me help you with that flip. I don’t need your help. Let me help! Yeah! Yeah! Help mommy. Sir, my mom can’t pick up the phone because she was abducted. There’s an alien invasion here. My sisters are being abducted too! I’m the youngest, I really need... Sir, help me. To, to, to... Mommy’s helper. And destroyer of mommy’s phone. Now, everyone... What are we gonna do? Get changed to go to grandma’s. Energy, youth! Let’s go! I'm not going.

Here, Baghdad, your style. Once in your life you’ll wear... That’s ridiculous. a dress for grandma. A dress for your grandma, you’re capable of doing it. Let’s go. What the hell, mom? You’re kidding me! I won’t wear it. It’s hideous. Mom, this doesn’t look like me! That's not the point. Dress up to visit grandma. I don't want, I feel selfconscious. It's been a long time since you last saw grandma. For God's sake. I don’t want these ugly clothes. I'm here! Big ass! Bia! You have a big ass. I don't! Yes, you do. What can I do if I have a little booty. Little booty? That’s a big ass! Stop it. Vetoed. Look at that skirt! Your legs will freeze. Look at your skirt, Micheline. It's a decent skirt. You're jealous. Come on, just put the clothes on. No way! She's supposed to put the clothes on and she takes it off. Mom, that’s beautiful. Look at it. Beautiful for your taste. Look! Let's go. Mom, no! Stop it. I'm ready. I'm ready. Me too. My God, Bia. Grandma's house. Honestly. Grandma will be surprised. Grandma’s is cancelled. Grandma’s is cancelled. We know you didn’t want to go either. Everybody jump on mom. First you, Josi! Come on, come on. My name is Zé Pereira and back home I'm called Arthur’s Zé. I was born in Alagoas, on Murungu’s Farm. I'm the grandson of Antonio Pereira and the son of Arthur. Pose, pose. She leaves us here in the closeup. Statue. Gladys, honey, whip something up for us, please? Just a minute, girls. I have an idea, hang on. My little nuisances. I'm starving. Come on, girls. Come help auntie. Bia, I'll put it here, ok? Take the lettuce and prepare it. What color is this, whose is that? Oh my God. Did you enjoy it? It’s delicious. It’s great. That’s good. Mine has a bite taken out of it, who did that? It was an alien that came here. Yeah, Bia, an alien came here last week. Really? If you spend more time with auntie Gladys you’d see the alien. Let her come more often, Micheline. I feel lonely here. Will you help me with the clients, Bia? I will. Tell me more about Mars. Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It’s considered the red planet because of its color. It has two moons, a lot of craters, and of course, Aliens. And there are aliens only on Mars and no other planet? No, we also have them here on Earth. Sit down, auntie. Make me pretty like you. That’ll be hard. Just joking. Butter me up, just to put me down. It’s easy. You’re gorgeous. You are, I don’t have to do anything. Hey Gladys! Ignore it. Psst. Psst, Gladys. Hey! He just wants some gum and makes such a scene, you'll see. Grab me a cachaça, will ya? Now what? Go, Baghdad. Just go, ignore it. Amazing. Do it again. Break it. It won't break. I broke a TV here once. Hey. Watch it. Idiot. I’m here for the destruction. What’s this? Deco. Ouch! Are you hurt? No. Stand up. I'm not hurt. I saw this and became emotional. So you fell on purpose. I fell on purpose to get closer. Cool! Where’s the thing you threw? Wow. Where’s the remote? It's here. Look at this. It’s one of those rich girl's bags. What do you think? I’ll be very fancy. Come on, Deco. Little miss priss. I’m rich, I have a thousand bucks to spare. You’ll be more feminine. Where did you find this? I bought it in a fancy store to match your style. Asshole. What about a bun? Vintage. For God’s sake, again? Sit down, Emilio. Breathe, breathe. Again, Emilio? I know what he wants. Hang on, I’m gonna go grab something. Don’t worry, it happens. Here, suck. He just needs something on his mouth. That’s all it takes. Now rest. There's no use taking all that medicine, and no rest at all. You don’t have to be the first to arrive and the last to go home. I know. You say that, but you don’t do it. I’m watching you. Feeling better? That’s enough. I know him. He just needs a minute. You’re too demanding of men. I don’t care for men, darling. They can all go to hell and fight over me. "This might push that cute guy away." I hope he disappears, I’m tired of men coming after me. "Learn how to get the perfect guy in ten steps" Ten steps is too many. I’m tired even before the first one. Dear, it’s exhausting. I put on high heels, dance all night long. By the end of the night, I don’t want nobody I just want to go home to sleep and ice my feet. Do you have to be like that to be a woman? Blond hair to the waist, tiny waist, small bum. No, honey. YOU have to find the woman in you. Look at yourself in the mirror and you’ll see the pretty woman you are. Ever looked at yourself? What about you? I’m an example of overcoming difficulties. Wonderful, no faults. But your weenie, is still there? You always have to talk about that? Everytime. Do you want to see it? I'll show you. You want to see, too? Gather round, I’ll show you. That’s awful, don’t say that. Auntie, I don’t look like these girls, they all the same. Magazines only have those girls... Thank god you're different. You have this little nosey, this beautiful hair. And the face of a princess. Doesn’t she look like that Italian singer? I forgot her name. Rita Pavone! Yeah, Rita Pavone. If I had a hammer. She’d hammer all the boys on the street. That’s her. That’s me. I want to learn how to do a boneless, you know? Show me what you got. And then you fall and die, right? If you fall, just get back up. That's how it goes. This ground is so shitty! If you keep looking, it’s like everyone lives in a little box. Lots of boxes. But that’s it, dude! Everybody is the same. Everybody has a family, has the same feelings. They go through the same problems, same hardships and all. On the surface, it looks like it doesn’t have a purpose. Everybody’s the same. Yeah, everybody's in the same line. Besides when you watch the morning news, dripping blood early in the morning. Breakfast dripping blood. Only hatred, you get scared to leave the house, you know? That’s it dude. Daily doses. An illusion veil. Yeah, an illusion veil. That’s sick! Word! The point is, whenever dreams and fantasies break, we have a chance to see... Reality. See the reality. Every day I wake up wanting to live, but there’s always someone to hold me back and tell me what to do, fuck off. Another police raid and it gets harder, when you’re treated like scum. The cops come and call you a nigga, and say it's not racism. Another one in the illusion veil. The illusion veil, the illusion veil! I move on doing my thing, sowing good, so the harvest can be fresh. So it’s fresh, so it’s fresh. When you discover all the lies and made believe stories, don’t despair. Now you’ll learn the truth. So, I move on… Move on. Move on. An illusion veil to the world. Against your own will. Your ambition is foolish, open your eyes to your selfishness, your nonconformity, jails of thoughtlessness, an awful and dangerous world. This can’t be, I can’t see anything, because everyone is under this illusion. Where’s the knowledge to shed light? I grab my skateboard, go outside, learn about the streets, I learn to respect the people around me, and live every day as if it’s the last. So I don’t live in this illusion veil. In this illusion veil. Illusion veil. Illusion veil. Illusion veil. Illusion veil. Illusion veil. Hey! Check out my car, dude. Nice, man. New sound system. Spent a ton of money. An investment. To fuck the girls. Gladys! Bring me more peanuts. I'm just ignoring them. Now, they won’t serve us. Whatever, she doesn’t matter, man. Here’s a good one, what’s the difference between a good shit and a good fuck? You don’t have to hug the toilet afterwards. Quiet down. She’s angry! You haven’t seen me angry. You haven’t seen an angry women in this bar! None of us! And I never even seen you in this bar. She’s mad! See, dude? These women won't shut up. Don’t waste your energy. You know what? Men are made of four defects. A head that doesn’t think, two breasts that don’t feed two balls that don’t roll, and a little bird that won’t fly. Get the hell out. I haven’t finished drinking. Pay up. Give him his bill, Baghdad. Sixty bucks. Give me back ten bucks. Ten is the fine. Ten? Ten is the tip. A bar needs men running it, not women. Women have to do the dishes, fuck you all! Get out! What about this one? Wake up and get out! Pull your pants up, before you leave. They’re gone. Look, mom, kicking your gate. Stop that, Baghdad. I'm gonna do that at your house. You don't even knock. Yeah, I just enter. Is it rolling? Yeah, it's working great. What? I put a new screw on her truck. Truck. Truck. Now you just need to get your tricks right. Honey, I skateboard better than you. Oh, sure. How did the job search go? They called me, I did the interview, but nothing happened. I don't know why you don't work at the factory. I don't want to be a nobody in life, mom. Did you hear that? So I'm a nobody? No, you're everything, amazing. But they don't value your work. You create a great new part for her board from scratch and no one cares. I think it's great, still. I'd work at the factory. You get to build things from scratch. The thing doesn't exist and you create it. But if I knew how to do it, I'd be the owner of the factory. You gotta have vision, you know? A capitalist. No. I just want to conquer the world. So, let me guess. One wants to conquer and the other to create. Yeah! While you do that, I'll go to work. While you conquer and create, I’ll be working and conquering. Work to conquer the world that I like. Conquer it all and build a ton of skateparks in the world. It would be a better place. Imagine if this was a skate world? A world of skaters. Skates everywhere. That'd be awesome. Be able to do tricks anywhere. Instead of cars, just skateboards. Damn, dude. We're lucky we got here. Bye. Let's go. Your blessing? Hey there! Son of a bitch, my car! You fucking punk! You fucking punk, that’s my car! My car, my car! You fucking punk! Son of a bitch! Fuck! You’re fucked, boy! I’m gonna get you! Fucking fag! Oh my god! I’m so offended… Are you leaving? Run away! Sucker! I know it’s you, Baghdad. And how do you know? I know the way you walk. Wow, how’s that? Mom, I’m learning to be less dependent on my eyes, because when I go to Mars my eyesight will be crushed, and I’m gonna get osteo… osteo… Osteoporosis? Yeah, that. Are you coming back from Mars with crushed eyes and problematic bones? I don’t want that. That’s the way it is mom. And you’re training every day? Yeah. You’re training every day to be late at school. No. It’s not working tonight because of the rain, it’s really loud. I can only hear the rain. Ok. In this case, you have a crew to help. Since your crew is awake, anyway. This is aluminum foil. It’s working. A spoon on the grater. Wow, you have eyes on your back. No. Keyboard... keyboard. What did I type? Do it again. Slowly. You just typed anything. Two lids hitting each other. I think you’re cheating. I got it! It’s the drawer or the closet creaking. No? Simpler than that. Oh, it’s the oven thing. Very good. The popcorn jar, shaking in mommy’s hands. Can somebody tell me what’s going on in here? Three little doves in the kitchen making noise this late at night. Wow! Damn, dude. Go, go! The dude flies, man. Holy fuck! What about a back two? You have to do a back two! Go for it! Dude, I feel like doing some tricks. Heey! I'll do one, and then you do one. Failed. What the fuck, man! Damn! Attention! The eggs truck is passing down this street with an incredible deal. It's 35 eggs for only ten bucks. I'm hungry. Calm down, Bia. I'm starving! Wait a minute, it's almost ready. My belly is making noises. Do you know what it would be nice? You do it youself. But I’m a kid. Let NASA know that. Do you know what would be cool? What? Stop telling her to do it herself if you can't even light the fire. But I did. Bag, I think we ran out of gas. We ran out of gas. I don't have strength to go to school. I'll take a nap to save energy. No. Sit down, little miss. We'll figure out a way to get it done. Bread and cheese. Look how delicious. I left the refrigerator open. Close it, Josi? I’ll do it. You know what would be cool? What? A grilled cheese sandwich. But we ran out of gas. What about the toaster? It's broken. You know what we could do? Sandwich NASA style. Have you ever had one? Then, it's going to be the first time. Get ready. You're going to try the aliens’ sandwich. Do you want only one slice? NASA. So, this is top secret special food from NASA. Then how do you know about it? I invaded NASA for a week, to help you to go to Mars. You think it’s good, Bia? Grilled cheese! The light is on. Can I eat it yet? Give me that to cut it in half. Beautiful! Food, I love it. Yeah, beautiful food. Little piggy. Let's see if it's good. Go ahead, Bia. Take the first bite and tell us. It's hot. It's hot? That's the only thing I know. It's really hot. Be careful! You're going to get yourself hurt. Such a skater girl. Yeah, definitely. She is skateboarding better than you already. Just let mom see this. It'll drive her crazy. Just don’t to tell mom. I'd tell her you're doing great, not because you're doing anything wrong. That's it for now. We're done for the day. Just till we get to school. I’m gonna go somewhere and then I’ll head to school, ok? Don’t go. Stay with me. Come, come. Bye. I will be there in a bit. You take care. You, too. CARE Name! Anderson Souza. What are you doing here? Skateboarding with my friends. Shouldn’t you be at school? We left early today. Where do you live? Antonieta Street, down here. Here’s the deal, I’m gonna frisk everyone! If I find anything, will you admit to it? You won’t find anything. Against the wall! Open your bag. Fuck! Turn around. Hey, Magalhães, is this a boy or a girl? What do you think? It’s hard to tell. Are you a boy or a girl? I'm a minor. What’s your name? Baghdad. That’s not a name. What’s your name? Baghdad. Give me your ID. Give me your ID. Tatiana. Tatiana. You hear that? 17 years old, got it? What are you doing with these guys? Nothing, they’re my friends. Oh, your friends... Take off your cap. Let me see... let me see! You fuck these guys, is that it? They're my friends. Where’s your boyfriend? Or is it a girlfriend? Huh? Who do you think you are? Do you have shit for brains, girl? Are you stupid? What are you doing here? I'm skateboarding. Skateboarding with all these guys? You’re the only girl here. If you were my daughter I’d slap you until you turned into a real woman. But since you like being among the guys, to dress up like a guy, You’ll be frisked like a guy. Turn around! You can’t do that! Yes I fucking can. What are you thinking, girl? I could hit you on the face. Spread your legs! There’s nothing. Let’s go, Magalhães. Do you see this spot you have here? The universe was smaller than that, smaller than this little speck. It exploded and now it's infinite. Crazy, isn't it? Very. If you want, you can sleep here today. Can I? Thanks. You're welcome. My little flower. Let's tell stories? Sure! Who starts? You. Once upon a time, there was a family of four amazing women. Obviously, their mother was gorgeous, very wise, Everything she touched was perfect. A very lively daughter other not much. Lively and gorgeous. The third one, very lively, very gorgeous. Pass. One day this family was sunbathing, when all of a sudden, a robotic skateboard appeared and destroyed the house. Pass. Then, this skateboard decided to destroy the entire house. And it came face to face with a little girl, but whose strength was enormous. And she said: "Only over my dead body". She grabbed a knife from her mom in the kitchen, and she tried to stab the robot, but it was very thick. Pass. The robot's belly was hard, he exercised his abs so much, you have no idea. The knife was destroyed. The girl ran away desperately and the robot after her. He didn't want to harm her. He was running after her, to say that he was a good robot and that it would do her no harm. The more she ran, the more it ran too. Around the house forever. The cat started running too, the dog running after the cat. Pass. Different pairs, same numbers? That's the way it goes. Your turn, Shock. Go, Shock. Only cheaters in this match. Go, go on. My turn? Yeah. Dude, this isn't a pair game. You're kidding me. Let's play truco. Your turn. I need one card. You keep cheating. Dude, I'm not cheating. You're even stammering. Your turn, Baghdad. Take one for me, too. I got it! You're kidding! You see, I got three here. You're cheating shamelessly, dude! No way, it's years of practice. Bulshit, man. I'm getting myself all ready, dude. I’m all shaved. The girls love it. You have to shave these hairy legs. Legs don't matter. It's here that matters. Look at your legs! It's Baghdad's armpits that need shaving. Show them to us. It's beautiful, envious. Looks like mine. Yours are ugly. Stop that nonsense, dude. You know I'm kidding, right? I know you find them lovely. I think you're gorgeous. Because you know hangovers are not what they used to be. After awhile we end up fainting, blacking out, and then come back to life. We? We. When I was a kid, there was this cartoon called Thunder Cats. A character used to say something like "Ancient spirits of evil, transform this decayed form into Micheline" A living poet. Good God. Praise the Lord. I’ve been very drunk, my friend. Some walks of shame, you know? I know. But my friends never had to come to me the day after, to tell me that I did the cancan on top of a table. Who danced the cancan on top of a table? Who hasn’t? Who hasn’t, right? Oh no, not again. You’re awful! You fucking asshole! Show your face! Come here, are you afraid, asshole? Why are you running away? Fuck you! Bastard! Come here. Help me carry him. The stench is too strong. Calm down. Let’s sit down. To the left, to the left. This again, I can’t take it anymore. Bring me the bucket, he’s puking again. Bring the bucket over. Thanks. Some water. Feeling better? We can’t take that smell anymore, awful thing. Everything will be fine. I can’t take the chemo anymore. Of course you can, queen, hang in there. I don't wanna die, Gilda. When queers die, they become glitter, right? I don't wanna die. I do, Emilio. I can’t wait! I don't wanna die. We’re all gonna die someday. But if I die now, no one will remember me. I will. I will, too. So will I. Three people, at least. Four. Four! If I disappeared from the Earth now, no one would know I was even here. No one. I’ve always known that when we die, we go to the gay valley. I don’t want to go there. I knew you wouldn't. But you are going! No, I'm not! I’ll record you, make a documentary. No one will ever forget you. He’s already smiling. Film him drooling. Look, how lovely. We love you. Smile, smile.

What are you interested in? I’ll put: "Everything about Mars". It’s too broad. Put that she has acute senses, and that she trained very hard in the dark. But I don’t know how to write "acute". It's "aguced". Excuse me. It's not. A... AGUCED. Are you sure that’s right? It must be. I think it’s just that... Oh, Bia, we have a problem now. It says you must be 18 to sign up for the expedition.

They put us on that little room, they gave the first medicine, the one that makes you want to vomit. I was standing, that heat, all that sick people like me. I didn’t even flinch. What did you do?

Didn’t you hear me? What did you say? What did you say, you asshole? Are you stupid? Go away. Old fags are just like shit, if it falls on the floor it spreads out. Say that again, you fucker. You son of a bitch! Can’t you hear me? So you’re the macho? Show us your cock. It’s bigger than yours, you asshole. Come on, come on! What are you going to do? Go fuck yourself. The sadness would disappear if for only one day I was a lion Hey, boss, good afternoon! Could you possibly give us a lift downtown? Thanks. Thank the driver! Thank you, driver. We're with you. Don't crowd, dude. I’m gonna listen to my music. Scorched earth is still earth. I wanted to be better. You have to practice. I know it really scares you. If you make a mistake, you’re on top of the stairs, man. We’re getting there, guys. We’re gonna go skateboarding! Skate! Skate! Hey, what's up? Are you girls from here? No, we’re from Freguesia. I’m asking cause we’ve never seen you before. We’ve been here before, but never seen other girls riding. It’s just us now, but sometimes there are like 30 of us. There are other skater girls in your hood? No, it's just us. No other girls there. We could go there, sometime. Yeah, you could come to Freguesia. We have some mini suicide ramps, but it’s cool. There are some cool street spots there. But let’s skate here, now. Let's go! What’s up? It’s nice you girls came. What’s up? Hey, what’s up? You ok? Cool. Welcome. Nice skatepark. Our backyard. Nice backyard. A backyard full of holes. Are you practicing? Dude, I’ve been trying this for the past four days. I think you can do it. You just have to bend over your body. Nice. It’s hard for me to flip my body. If you can do the 360, then you can do the spin. You just have to flip your body. Yeah. Giulia’s fakie has a lot of pop. That’s it, then just jump. Go, Baghdad! Fucking shit! I’m going to learn a trick today! Awesome! Nice. Hey, girls. Let’s do something else. Smoke a joint. I’ll record you. Is the skatepark always empty? What? Is it always this empty? Yep. It’s abandoned because the floor is bad. People say it doesn’t exist, you know? "Cause when we’re skateboarding together, it’s family, it’s unity, you know? There's no machismo." Once I was on the street and a bus driver put his head out the window, and kept asking me if I really knew, asking me to do some tricks. And you know, the guy was working. The guy wasting his time, so the girl can prove she skates. "Hey, do a flip!" "You really know how to skateboard?” Have you seen that gringo TV show where there's a guy in a car, saying “Do a flip”? You’re crazy, man. Riding with girls, you don't ride with other girls yet, that's why we came here. the more girls, the better. We’re so close, so much on the same vibe, that sometimes we even get our periods together. It’s true. That's witchcraft, dude. Oh! I want to get my period together with you! For real! That’s what I call connection. Let’s get our periods together, make a moon ritual. Let’s get our periods together. Cool! That’s so crazy, because I used to hate having my period, And now I’m starting to like it. Acceptance. Respect, Baghdad. Two sober girls? Sober, but not that much. It depends on the moment. It’ll be quick. Ouch! It hurts too much, and there’s still some left. Calm down, Baghdad. This is horrible. Let me take care of you. I don’t want it anymore. You’re gonna wax just half? Yes, it’s not worth it. No, Baghdad, that’s ugly! Fuck off. What are you doing? You’ll break my powder. Do it right. Leave me alone. You’re doing it wrong. Get off, Joseane. Ok, excuse me, I'm just trying to help. You gonna look awful. And what are you getting ready for? Because I’m going to the party. What party? With you. No, you aren’t. Of course I am. You aren’t. Why not? I won’t take you with me. Come on girl, stop being like that. I helped you. Don't be so ungrateful. You're not going. Of course I am. I’m not taking you. Then stop using my makeup. Excuse me. If I’m not going, you'll stay ugly, with just a dot under one eye. Stop bothering me. Hey, bro. If you don’t take me, I’ll tell mom. Tell her what? Let me use this thing. My nails! Get off, asshole. Give me that. Stop being annoying. Stop it, give me that. Let me use this. No, you won’t. If you won’t let me go, I’ll tell mom. Tell her what? What will I tell her? Will you snitch me? Call her then. I will, Baghdad… Mom! Stop it! I hate you, annoying skinny girl. Get off! Stop it! Mom! What will you tell her? I’m not going to raise my voice. What are you laughing at? All I ask is an hour once a month for myself, and I can’t even have that. What's going on here? Your daughter won’t let me go to the party with her. She’s not going. Go make some friends. Mommy is nice, mommy is cool, but mommy makes the rules here. Mommy rules. And mommy decided that both are going to the party. and if you complain, you’re going holding hands. That’s not fair, there'll be booze there, I'll not take care of her. It’s a chance for you to learn to take care of your sister. I don’t want to. For God's sake. It’s not fair. Nature isn’t fair. It’s good that you learn while you’re young. You both suckled on this tits, came out of this pussy, and look what I have to go through. Both of you, off to the party! We’re gonna be late, honey. Let’s toast! Nice glasses! What’s up, guys. Cool? Now, we're talking. Hey, Bag! Peace. Give me some, please. Hi there. Oh, my. What’s your name? Joseane. Welcome, Joseane! Hi. Nice to meet you, I’m Baghdad’s sister. Didn’t you bring any friends? No, today I wanted to meet you guys, so it’s just me. That's cool! Clever here. Clever? Pleasure. So what are you guys into? We skateboard, right? I’ve been meaning to learn, but Baghdad won’t teach me. I’ll teach you. Will you? No, she’ll learn by herself. Do you want some? I do. No, you don’t. Didn’t you say you were refined? But I want to try things. Come here. I’m going to have some gum, dude, she’s totally into me. Are you gonna be hitting on all of the boys? What the fuck! What the fuck? I’m free, I want to enjoy. You can be free, but don't hit on the boys and hold your liquor. I'll not take care of you. Sorry, sister, come on. Improvise! What the fuck. Wow! Josi, let's go! I mean it. Let me stay. Have you seen all the cute guys here? That's so hard to find. Baghdad, what’s happening? Let’s go, please. I don't want to go. Look at you, please. Let me explain, I want to be free. You're free, babe. I wanna kiss, dance, Why are you always on my case? Because you don’t know how to live. I know how to live. Come on. Oh my, this one is cute. Leave me. Let's go. Please. Just another song, another drink. Come on. Hey, guys, I'll call you later! For God’s sake. Everything is spinning. Calm down. I’m okay, I can see the thing. Ok, so keep going. I am going. Oh, Baghdad, I think I have to go to the bathroom. I feel sick. You’re the nanny tonight, right? And you guys didn’t make it any easier. I was just having fun with her. How so? Just having fun. Just fun? Want some? Yeah. I was just teasing her. You know that you are my muse, right? Give me a break. It's true. You know it. I have the hots for you. That’s ridiculous. Let me tell you something. I’m a great kisser, you won’t regret it. Really? I don’t think so. You must be an awful kisser. You want to see? I know you want to. Awful... I hated it, F. Another one. I don’t want to, I didn’t like it. Get off, I didn’t like your kiss. I doubt it. Stop it. Everybody likes it. I don’t. One more. I don't wanto to. Stop being annoying. I’m not being annoying, I know you want too. I'm telling you I don’t. You tease. I’m not teasing you. You tease. What the fuck, Clever? What? Get the fuck off of me. I’m not on you. What are you doing? You just tease. Kissing me and trying to leave. Fuck you, dude. Come on, you kiss me and now you want to leave. That’s it, get off. You tease. Get off, let me go! Don’t scream. Don’t scream. You tease me, then leave me hanging? You won't tease me, and leave me hanging. Get off. Stop it, the guys will hear. What’s going on here? Get off! What's your problem? Sorry, my bad. Very bad, you idiot. What happened? Bag... Bag? Let's just go. What happened? Can you get down? I can. Let’s get out of here. Are you ok? I still need to believe. Believe. Next one. Are you giving up? Yeah, I'm tired. Not even close. Thanks. Wow, dude. I even landed it. I'm gonna chill out now. What about your sister that day at the party? A little trouble, but she saved me in the end. What do you mean, saved? Nah, tell you some other time. Whenever you want to. Thanks. Thanks a lot. It’s all good. Let’s ride. Yeah, go. I clicked on my test button… and turned it on. Now, my machine to connect me with the aliens is on. What's the news? The news is that I discovered that I have to type a password on the keyboard, that I won't tell you and I'll keep the phone on me to see if they answer. What's the password? I told you, I can't tell. Did it work? It did. Actually, I don't know, because they didn't answer yet. Alien answering machine again. Bia, could you please do me a favor, buy this plot of land on Mars asap, I can't take this heat anymore. On Mars it's 120 degrees Celsius, it's a thousand times hotter than here. Here it’s 30… 35 degrees maximum. You're joking, right? No, I'm not. I can't. I'm going to die here. Die, then. Hi, Deco! Baghdad? She has terrible diarrhea. I don't know I think she ate something that didn't agree with her. We're even using the neighbor's bathroom, can you believe it? It’s cutting out. Asshole. A small fall and you get fucked up. You know what I think? When we're skateboarding, and we're not concentrating, If we're a bit angry, it's easier to fall. Yeah, you're not as confident. And I think you're not concentrated, thinking about a lot of things. Not even being sad, it's just that sometimes when I'm angry, I like to focus on skateboarding, spend all my energy on it. Then, I focus and don't fall, but when I'm distracted, I get all fucked up. That's it, you have to keep the energy on skateboarding. When you're on the board, you can't think of anything else. You're there, thinking about your feet, your kick. The jump. Skateboarding is the meditation of the future. Let's meditate today, then. Live fully. You bet. You're present, you're really there, you know? There's nothing else, you're focused. What up? Hey! You good? You ok? Nice to see you all here. I saw a video of people swapping skateboards, you know? Grabbing and swapping the boards. Oh, I know. Cool! While riding? One throws the skateboard and the other jumps on it. Throw it, then jump on it. Yeah. Dude, let’s do it? We can try. We could definitely try. I'm leaving, bye. What, really? Why? We'll see each other later. We just got here. You’re not leaving, we'll solve this. It’s cool. Resolve what? That thing you told us? About the party. The guys that just got here? That one over there. You're joking. Let's talk to him. Come on, Baghdad. Let’s handle this now. Come on. Let's do it. Come here, Clever. Come on, let's talk. What's up, dude? Get over there. Why are you pushing me? Are you scared? I'm not scared. Doesn't look like it. What is it? Tell us what you did to Baghdad. Do you think that was right? Come on! Didn't she say "no"? You're all acting crazy. We’re acting crazy?! Why you're confronting me? Say it, dude. Say what? What did you do? What's up, Baghdad? Talk. I'm not acting crazy. Yeah, you are acting crazy! Aren't you man enough to force others? But not enough to admit it? What did I do? Tell us what you did to Baghdad. What, Baghdad? Just admit it. Take the opportunity, and tell your friends. Fuck off, being drunk is not an excuse. Nothing happened. What happened, Clever? Spit it out. If Baghdad wanted to make out with you, all your friends would know, since she refused, no one knows. What the fuck did you do? We made out at the party. I was drunk. I don't care you were drunk, tell them what happened next. Talk. I don't remember. Don't you remember what you did? Don't remember my ass! You pushed me against the wall, covered my mouth and and told me not to scream, so your friends wouldn't hear. Do you remember that? Take your hands off me, Deco. Calm down. No fight in the skatepark. Do you think you are need to make a move on every girl you know? If she didn't want, would you rape her? Is that it? No, dude, never. Stop it, dude. Never what? Between what you did, and raping is a blink. Now, there's no talk. I'll break your face. Get out of my face. She's your friend, dude! Even if she wasn't. You don't treat a girl like that. He's your friend too, but he can't touch you? But you can touch me and force me to do things I don't want to, because you were drunk? I didn't force anything. Of coursed you did. Admit what you did. I am saying. I'm saying you did force me. That's bad, dude. Don't pretend you're a nice guy. That's wrong, man. Get off, take your hands off me. You're incapable of confessing. We come to the skatepark, you guys start grinning, making fun of us, as if we were nothing, as if we didn't come to skateboard, too. We tell him that everyday, but he won't believe. No, that's for everyone. Why do you hang out with an agressor? Why? Tell me. You're saying he's your friend, right? Why you hang out with a guy like this? I didn't know he'd be capable of that. This is a reflection of what he does everyday and you guys accept it. Taking everything he says as a joke. We're tired, man. We won't take this sort of thing anymore. Every time I step in the skatepark, I'm observed, I stay in the corner. Don't you notice? That's right. It's true. I didn't even come here before I've met Baghdad. I felt super uneasy here. That's why there's no skater girls. You guys take the whole skatepark for yourselves. You never see our side. If we started reporting things, we would be here for hours. Lot's of girls quit skateboarding and come to us: "I've stopped because I felt uneasy, the guys kept despising me." Then you say that skateboarding is about union. What union if the girls aren't included. Only you guys. How can we know what you feel? Listen, dude! Listen! Think it over. Listen instead of saying we're crazy. And say that we're lying?! The girl came here and said to your face that you harrassed her. And you denied it. Childish attitude. I can't take it anymore. We had no idea. I wouldn't imagine this. It's all about listening. Listen and think it over. Dude, I've already said it to you many times. Many times. You know, Clever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry my ass. Fuck you.
