[orchestral music...] [music continues] [music fades] [indistinct voices] [distant typing] Sorry, did I distract you? Oh, no, no, no. You must be brilliant. Oh, this! Oh, yeah, it's a masterpiece, yes. "a throbbing fleshy appendage Downloading data at lightning speed." Hmm. Tchu! Did you just erase it all? I did. Why? It was a load of crap, And it won't hold anyone's interest. Why don't you put your masterpiece away for a while? You never know. You might get a bit of inspiration. [female clears throat] we'll serve dinner shortly. Have you made your choice? Uh, beef. Chicken. [screaming] [laughs] Sorry! It's not my sick sense of humor, really. This friend of mine advised me to take a couple of air sickness pills Before I got on the plane, and now, well, they make me a bit groggy. Goof number two. Must be this, too. Hi, I'm kathy. Kathy thomas. [hispanic accent] silvia. Vacation? They say the island's really something. So I've heard. Traveling solo? I know... Mind your business. Sorry, sweetie, I'm a lost cause. I just love poking my nose into other people's lives. Probably 'cause I don't have one of my own. It's the price we workaholics have to pay. Fast walkers. The sports store? They reward their best salespeople with an annual trip. This year it's to majorca. (hostess) dinner? Oh, sure. Can I have a couple of whiskeys as well, please? [cell phone ringing] [hispanic accent] people can be a pain, huh? Third time since we landed. Someone misses you. Apparently. That ain't surprising. I'm already missing you, and we haven't even said goodbye yet. [cell phone ringing] [chattering] [speaking a foreign language] (david) in a world where scientists vie To produce the first human clone And entire populations can be annihilated Without even a brick being damaged, The question is, Is it still possible to write science fiction? When reality is becoming more and more Like a story that has been hatched From the twisted mind of one of my fellow authors. It seems reality is extremely eager To put the rest of us out of a job. But I'm not gonna let that happen. I cant let That happen after 25 novels, I still enjoy what I'm doing, I love the process. People ask me where my ideas come from. And it's not unlike an illness. And what I mean by that is, uh, You open a window or, uh, let's say you're taking the subway, Where you expose yourself to virus. Likewise in my life, uh, I can be infected by things around me. It could be a tv program, I could overhear a conversation and think, "oh, that's interesting." Or I could--I mean, sometimes it's, um, just a single image Will suffice for the virus to, uh, To enter my organism and, um, start to grow and pretty-- Pretty soon, it's taken over my whole--body. And then, before I know it, uh, the only way to escape, Is to write the damn book. Even if it means, along the way, I created a few monsters. I've been involved in public utilities for 30 years, Well, 32, to be exact, Working for the los angeles water authority. Wow, that's a lot of years. A lot of water. [chattering] A pleasure meeting you, if you'll excuse me. Oh! Your pen. Yes! I just--always-- thank you. (british male voice) could I borrow you for a second? Yeah, borrow away. As you can see, I'm an old fan. [woman's laughter] I've been a follower of yours since the beginning. 1979. Yes, first edition. I don't even think I have a copy like this. You, you want me to sign it again? Oh, would you? It's your finest work. Let me tell you a secret. I was 20 when I wrote this. The structure is clumsy, the style changes every chapter, The characters are rehashed from books I read. I should know. I wrote it. Oh, not so! It's your most personal work. Full of passion, intuition, suffering. Suffering, yes! Oh, you got that right. In those days, all I ate was biscuits stolen from the neighbor's dog. I should've dedicated this book to that dog. I fear my comments have upset you. No, no, not at all. Why should they? It seems everyone believes that I'll never write anything better, So I just resign myself. [male voice speaking a foreign language] That's very good. Excuse me. It's aunt jo, seems very worried. Aunt jo is looking after our kids, five of them, Uh, all adopted, each from a different continent, Well, apparently, nanook, our little eskimo, Had a slight mishap sledding down the stairs, So, unfortunately, we must-- I'm really sorry. Just put nanook on the phone. Excuse us. (david) hey, little buddy! [foreign language] Aunt jo, five kids, and one of them's an eskimo? Yes, little nani nanook. We can't forget him. What was that about? It must mean something. I never heard myself ever talk about kids, ever. Not even in fun. So it's probably just a very complicated, uh, Way of wanting to ask you a very simple question. [sigh] What's that? Will you marry me? Now, you don't have to answer now, Just, you, take your time, but-- Promise me you'll think it over. I will. Okay. That's all, just, you know, Think it-- that's all, just-- we'll leave it at that. All right, I lied, you gotta tell me now "yes." What if I say "no?" Yeah, and what if I jumped off a cliff? (male voice) excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting. Interrupting? No, not at all. No, not at all. I just asked her to marry me. Congratulations to both of you. Thank you. Well, the president of the foundation Hopes the hotel is to your liking. He also asked me to give you This small gift on his behalf. He deeply regrets having to dash off. He said you'd understand. Thank you. What's that about? Ever been to a party and thrown your drink in the host's face? That's what I did before. Okay, uh, now-- Yes! (david) what kind of fancy hotel is this? No wedding chapel. It's an outrage. We should sue! [chuckles] You just passed our room! Did you just see that guy? That was the same guy sitting next to you at the conference. There's nobody there. I'm telling you it's the same guy. Do you realize you were sitting next to a russian hitman? You're kidding me? You don't think murderers read books? These guys, okay, they have skulls tattooed on each of their fingers Signifying how many murders they've committed, right? It's a russian prison code kind of thing. Mmm. Oh, yeah! Don't you ever let up? Even on a night like this. Wait. Give me five minutes. I wanna slip into something more comfortable. I'll give you two minutes or I'm gonna start without you. Just you try it. [sigh] Hm. [beep] What are you doing? Oh, there was a dvd on the bed. It's intended for me. You're not gonna watch it right now, are you? It'll just be a second. I just wanna see what it is. Im curious. I get the strangest things from people. One time I got a photo of a green ear With the word "mars" written underneath it. What do you think of that? Fascinating. Look. See. Awww. See? I don't know what it is, but my readers are prone to lunacy. They were probably sane before they read your books. [phone rings] I'll tell you what. They've outdone themselves this time. [squeaking] [screaming] [monkey whimpers] Must be some kind of a hoax, jane. I should call the front desk and tell them to be more careful. I mean, what if it had been a bomb or something? Jane? Jane, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have put that damn thing on. Jane? Jane? Jane? [indistinct shouting] [female voice screams] [electronic music] (dj speaking spanish) like a ride on my plaything? (silvia) I'll drive Over my dead body [cell phone ringing] For god's sake, kevin, give me a break. [beep] [chattering] Coffee in the kitchen. I'll call you later, okay? [cell phone rings] Drop it, would you? Which of those words don't you understand? [heather nova singing gloomy Sunday over the phone] Sunday is gloomy Kevin? My hours are slumberless Dearest the shadows Hey, what's all this about? I live with are numberless If this is you, I don't find it funny. [beep] Not where the black coach Of sorrow has taken you Angels have no thought Of ever returning you Would they be angry If I thought of joining you Gloomy Sunday Gloomy Sunday With shadows I spend it all My heart and I Have decided to end it all Soon they'll be candles And prayers that are sad, I know Let them not weep [very loud thud] [screams] [breathing and heartbeats] [periodic beeping] Any idea why she may have done it? Did she leave a note explaining her motives? If you're talking-- suicide, She had no reason t--to-- But there are two witnesses in the hotel who saw her jump. You were admitted with a serious concussion, But these scans didn't show up anything unusual. I don't remember a thing about what happened. Well, you might within the next few days or maybe never. Whatever the case, you're a very lucky young lady. You've been re-born. So, what happens now? Can I go? You'll have to see the psychologist first. It's usual in cases like yours. According to your analysis, you'd taken several substances. Delirium, amnesia, respiratory problems, The effects of the ketaminhydrochloride that was in your bloodstream. Do you have a problem with drugs? Listen, I'm no pill popper. Okay? I didn't jump. I got into the shower, and the next thing I know I was in a hospital. So if you weren't drugged, and nobody pushed you, What did happen? [phone rings] Excuse me. Yes? (female voice over phone) the supervisor needs to see you. It's urgent. Okay. Will you excuse me for a minute? Yeah. (man speaking spanish) thirty six years old and she jumps off a balcony. What do you suppose was going through her mind? That's the last form. It's for the insurance. We'll take care of the coffin from the consulate. Though it'll take a while to get her repatriated. They still have to do an autopsy. They say you can see the body before you leave, If you--want. No, I'd rather not. Could I have another one of those forms, please? [scream] [phone rings] [whimpers] (male speaking spanish) anyway You're already dead. [knock at door] (male voice) señorita, Your taxi is here. [soft whimpering] Señorita? I--I go get some help. I'll be right back! [whimpering] (speaking spanish) her pupils are dialated. She's on something. You'll be fine in no time. We're taking you to the hospital. I'm not going to the hospital! I'm out of here! (female voice) sir? Sir? Excuse me. You're next. Well, can I change it? Sorry, you won't be traveling tonight. This is an economy class ticket. Nonexchangeable. But there must be some way! You have to buy another ticket. (employee) it's terminal three. Gate d 69. Have a nice flight, mr. Norton. There are-- some seats available on the 11:30 flight. Yeah? But only first class. The ticket costs 5500 euros. I can't afford that. I can try tourist class for tomorrow. I don't want a ticket for tomorrow! I want out of here now! Please--calm--down. How do you expect me to calm down? They're trying to kill me! (employee) security, please. Window 4. What are you doing? Who are you calling? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait! Hey! Wait! Remember me? I need your help. I've got to get out of here! I'm sorry-- I was in the hospital. In the next bed, don't you remember? She was your wife, wasn't she? What? She jumped as well. They want me to believe I jumped, but it's not true! They're trying to kill me! [many screams] [screaming and shouting] (male voice shouts) he jumped! Young women saved by cafe awning Biker killed driving in the wrong direction [thunder of a plane] Are you feeling better? Yeah. But my head's about to burst. Thanks for yesterday. Well, I-- I mean, I wasn't gonna leave you like that. Not after what happened. Yeah. What's your name? Silvia. I'm the girl saved by the awning. David. You're the writer. Got a cigarette? I must have seemed completely out of it yesterday. To be honest, I'm not even sure what has happened. Well, you said jane didn't kill herself. I said that? I know I didn't jump out of that window. But I have no idea what really happened. (male voice) we'll have a duplicate of your stolen passports Sent to the hotel this afternoon. Thank you, I just need to get you to sign this form, please. What about what we just told you? Do you think we should go to the police? I'd advise against it. They're unlikely to believe you Unless you come up with something more specific. More specific than eight suicides in three days? Two, actually. The others were deaths under mysterious circumstances. You're forgetting about the man Who attacked me at my hotel. You didn't report it to the police. I wasn't in a fit state to talk to anybody. I just wanted to get out of there. The article on your fall mentions the intake of narcotics. Oh, yeah. I get it. I'm trying to make you see what the police will think. At least, if someone else in the hotel had seen that man, but, uh, That's, uh, that's not the case, is it? Listen, now, the guy who left that disk in my hotel room Is the same guy who robbed me at the airport. Now, I'm sure of that. The, uh, Tattooed hitman. Now you can scoff at it all you want, But the point is, I saw it, I know what the tattoos represent on his fist. And he's the same man who robbed me, And he's the same man who slipped that piece of paper in my pocket. Not a figment of my imagination. I'm not making it up-- Mr. Norton, um-- You've just been through a very traumatic experience. Couldn't you have put this in your pocket and not known it? Let's go. All right, we're gonna go to the police. Do you think you can give them An accurate description of this guy? Why, for christ's sake? Everybody has branded me as a fucking junkie. Even the newspapers. Who's gonna believe anything I say? Nobody gives a shit about what happened Or that some fucking nutcase told me I was dead already. Can you describe this guy? Of course I can. He was this far away! Okay, okay, so, Describe him. What? You don't believe me either? That's just great! Listen, silvia. Nobody's in a hurry to believe me. Now remember. I am on your side. Let's do this together, okay? I can see him, but I just can't put it into words. Try, try, try. He was-- run of the mill, ordinary-- You're the writer, not me. It helps sometimes, when I'm trying to build a character, Take a look around at the people, like that guy. Over there, drinking the beer. No, he was slim. All right, let's find somebody else who's slim and reminds you of him. And then we'll build the face like a jigsaw puzzle. Just take a look around. [violin playing] Silvia? There was music. What? Before it all happened. I was in the shower and I answered the phone, then I heard music. And then I began to feel bad. That's the last thing I remember Before I woke up in the hospital. Who was on the phone? I don't know. But a name flashed up on my cell phone. Where's your cell phone? It's gonna be in the memory. Charlie. [buzz] (neighbor in spanish) if you're ringing the 3rd floor you won't get an answer. There's nobody at home? The boy who lived there was killed yesterday in a bike accident. They say he was driving up the wrong side of the highway. Silvia, so listen, there's no coincidence here. We're dealing with bits and pieces that make up a bigger puzzle. And if the phone call had anything to do with it, It means jane probably received it as well. It had to have been the last number. What is it? It's the same call. Are you sure? Yeah. Gloomy Sunday. And that music, that woman singing? It's a song title. Some hungarian wrote it. He ended up taking the big leap. Others had the same idea, it seems. The song had a strange effect on them. How come you know so much about it? Because as a kid it obsessed me. So much so, I made it the title of my first novel. In my novel, everyone gets an implant at birth. A state-controlled device that when activated, drives people to suicide. Meaning that the state can eliminate whoever it wants Without getting its hands dirty. Those people against the system, They simply wipe themselves out. They call it self-elimination. Sound, uh, familiar? Sounds like pure fiction. (female voice) where are you going? Where's your boss? I mean, the president of the vernon foundation, The man who brought me to this island. I wanna speak to him. There must be some mistake. The villa is rented out for events. If you would like information on Who books the villa-- you can't go in there! [jazz music] Same handwriting. [cheering] [music and shouting] Now what? Now we wait. He's calling the shots. You think if they knew they were gonna die tomorrow, They'd give a shit about that stupid game? You're not gonna die tomorrow. But this might be my last beer. Yes, or mine or anyone else's. I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. It's just that it seems as if everyone around me ends up dying. I'm still here. Is that him? Yeah. Wait here. My dear fellow, you can't imagine how glad I am to see you again. The other night, we weren't even properly introduced. Frank kovak. Please, sit down. I imagine you're tired of listening to people Who approach you with the same intention. However, I'm convinced that this will interest you. What is it? To quote the expression that you yourself used at the conference, A virus. The germ of a great story. So you've brought me all this way To pitch me a story. I understand your surprise. But this is not just any story. It's something quite new. The opportunity that every writer dreams of having someday. Tell me something. What is the connection between gloomy Sunday And what's been happening on the island? Do you really not know? Unfortunately, All wars have their casualties. Give me one good fucking reason not to tear your head off! You and that girl Make a fine couple, don't you think? What are you getting at? Her last beer. It could be now. Tomorrow. The day after. Fear. That's the key. If those who rebel against the system, End up killing themselves, The rest will then toe the line. That idea is from your book. What I wrote was a story. Our imagination is never innocent, david. From the moment you start to imagine it, it began to exist. Self-elimination. There you have it. Your prophecy fulfilled. For over 50 years, The world has lived in peace, Thanks to a bomb. Now, it will do so, thanks to you. To us. One could say that you're the real father of this project. Although getting to this point, Has not by any means, been easy. The world is full of bureaucrats and gray people Who need to see to believe. They don't want theories. They require proof. And I'm not talking about tests done on animals. What are you? You need to ponder things. And understand. Then we'll be ready to help each other. Only then. [cheering] Oh, hey. Get a load of this. Frank kovak, the untold story. Half a century of dubious achievements. Born in hungary, 1935. Three brothers but only he survived the war, After which he and his parents emigrated to america. Now, a gifted student, scholarship to harvard, 1957, and then he graduated first in his class, Thanks to a highly praised experiment, The kovak box. It consisted of a maze in which a rat's behavior was conditioned By a series of stimuli and deterrents. At the time, it was considered the biggest breakthrough In behavioral research since pavlov's dog. His future could not have been brighter, Until this newspaper here published a photo Of him doing the same experiments applying it to human beings. There was a scandal. The academic world turned their back on him, But the cia, they got their hands on him, And they offered him unlimited means to continue the same exact experiments, All very hush-hush, though. How could they photograph such a thing? In 1979, my first book, gloomy Sunday, was published. In 1980, kovak started what he called the gloomy Sunday project. However, certain facts came to light about the consequences That these experiments had on various people, Resulting in the families of 12, uh, victims suing the federal government. So the cia, they needed a scapegoat. Kovak, he fled the country. But he starts over from scratch doing the same stuff for other governments, Until three years ago, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. At which point, he retired and moved to this island. At his last checkup, his doctors told him That he had six months to a year to live. We have to take all this to the police. No, no, no! You have to understand, this is evidence that implicates him directly. Do you think he would've given us all this stuff If he didn't think that he could get rid of us just like that? So what do I do? Sit around doing nothing, Until he decides whether I live or die? We're not gonna do anything to put you into danger. Don't you see? He's using me to make you do what he wants. What do you mean? How? He wants you to write his biography. I'm afraid it's got to be a lot more twisted than that. If not, then why did he kill jane? [phone rings] Hello? (female voice) sorry to disturb you, But we need to know if you are extending your stay with us. I can't say right now. [door closes] Silvia! [thud] Hello? Hello? Silvia!! Silvia!! Ohh! (cabdriver in spanish) any particular police station? The nearest one. [cell phone rings] Hello? No, I'm with a fare right now but we can meet up later if you like. [speaks spanish] Hey you're breaking up, I'm losing the signal. [horn honks] Can you believe that? [heather nova singing gloomy Sunday /I] Turn the radio off. (cabdriver) what's wrong? Calm down! [driver speaks spanish] [cars honking] [many cars honking] Silvia!! (david) you didn't have your cell phone with you. Do you remember how it began? Yeah. That music suddenly came on the radio and then-- I just wanted everything to be over. It was like I was in a deep hole. I was scared. I couldn't breathe. What have they done to me? I think there might be a way of finding out. (doctor) it shouldn't take long now for a body to be repatriated. A couple of days at the most. Did they find anything inside her? You mean, traces of alcohol or drugs of some sort? No, like an object, a device, inside her. I know it sounds odd but something tiny Like a microchip that they use to id pets, track animals. My autopsy did not come up with anything That could explain what she did. I guess that's what you want. An explanation. What about her brain? Was it analyzed? There was no reason. There could have been an absence of serotonin, low levels of serotonin, Induced depression, so a complete absence Could have caused suicide, right? I can't think what would cause that sort of imbalance in the brain. Well, if antidepressants exist, then the opposite would be-- A depressant? Mm, feasible, I guess but-- Who'd be interested in producing something like that? (silvia) david. Could you, uh, Just wait outside for me for a few minutes? I'd like to be alone with her. If that's okay. Sure. Take your time. (male doctor in spanish) the incision to open up The entire front part of the body is usually made in the form of a "y". From the shoulders to an angle at mid chest level. Which then joins into a straight line that extends all the way to the pubis. David! Silvia! I've seen him! The man who attacked me is here! Careful. It's him! I'm sure of it! He's one of the coroners. He's giving a lecture down the hallway. Don't move. I need to see something. Do you remember ever getting vaccinated back here? Why? What is it? Okay, um, Just look. Okay, do you see? Do you see? Yeah. At least we know where they put it. Take it out! What are you doing? No, no, no! Silvia, listen! It could hemorrhage. Only a surgeon can take it out. If you won't do it, I'll do it myself! Silvia, listen to me. You could kill yourself. He said I was dead already. This is what he was after. He wanted to cut it out. Agh! (david) get in the car! Go! You work for kovak? Kovak? Who's kovak? So you never heard of a man named kovak? You never met me either? What is it you remove from the necks of dead bodies? [swish] Please! Be careful with that! All right, tell me everything you know. I only know one person. A tall man. A russian? Maybe. A friend of mine introduced us. I owed people money and he offered to pay my debts If I did a job for him! What job? Remove something from certain corpses. He knew I worked at the morgue. He knew everything about me. I had to take this thing out before we did the autopsy and give it to him. He gave me a list. A list of dead bodies? No, they're not dead. Not at first, but one by one they end up in the morgue. It's a list of people who are going to die. What about me? Why did you attack me? I wasn't dead! I needed to earn more money! I thought if I could hang on to one of those things, I could blackmail them! She survived, but her name was on the list! Where's the list? There's everything. The ones crossed off are the ones who have already reached the morgue. They asked me to take photos of all of those involved. (david) there must be over 100 names on this list. (silvia) including mine. [speaks spanish] (female in spanish) paul, come here! I'm sorry I didn't hear you come in I was in the kitchen. Don't worry hanna. Will they be staying for dinner? Leave everything, take the night off. I've put the child to bed. Do as I say and leave! Come here, come to daddy. Now please go. My wife will be arriving in a minute. She doesn't know anything about this. No, you must remove the thing from her neck. It's impossible! Those things activate if you try to manipulate them! David, look! He has a mark! You have your list. Please leave us alone! Those people are threatening me. Why? If I don't do the job properly, my son and I-- Will end up like those other bodies. You lied to us. You couldn't blackmail them with that thing in your neck. What did you plan to do to me? If I'd managed to extract it without harming you, I could've done the same for my son. So you give us this list. What do you think they're gonna do when they find out? Okay...Okay. I'll tell you the truth. There's no point in us working against each other. They told me to give you the list. They wanted you to have it. What? They warned me that you were coming to the morgue. I was supposed to let myself be seen and hand it over. They wanted you to believe that you were making me do it. Why? Who knows why? They promised that-- That if I played my role well, They would disconnect this damned thing permanently. How could they have known we were on our way to the morgue? Because they're always one step ahead. They're always with us in some way. A microphone. There has to be something we're carrying on us. There has to be. Then they heard us. [door closes] Where are they? Papá. (david) open the door! [pounding] Open the door!! Open the door! Your child's out here! Open the door! [beeping] [shout] [breaking glass] Get him out of here. Open the door now! [shouts] [thuds] (woman speaks spanish) I'm home. Take it easy, the child is ok. Who are you? (david) nooo!!! Jaume? I'm sorry. There was nothing I could do. What have you done? He tried to remove it. It activates, just like in the novel. Even that was my idea. Remember at the hospital? When you were sitting with jane, looking at her? No one's ever looked at me that way. Could you give me a hug? I haven't got a hope in hell, have I? (jaume) they told me to give you the list. They wanted you to have it. Silvia, That list, why make that poor sucker play a role In order for us to have the list? He was a character in the book. Yeah, but this isn't a book. It's reality. No, no, but it's-- it's--it's reality Manipulated for dramatic effect. Just like a novel. He doesn't want a biography. He wants me to write about Everything that's happened on the island since I arrived. What are you talking about? This list, this piece of paper, This has information. This is gonna take us to the next chapter. He wanted us to have it. Just like the song or the beer mat. You see? Now he could've got straight to the point But he wants us to live an adventure. What for? To force me to live a story. Make it grow inside my head. I've been inoculated. I'm being inoculated with a virus, slowly. He said so himself. Do you really think that what you're saying makes any sense? Pure fiction? Kovak! Frank kovak! I want to see frank kovak! Bring me to frank kovak! See? There they are. Come on. Now, listen. Listen. I'm gonna get you out of here, but you have to trust me. Come on. Mr. Norton. Pleasure to meet you. Mr. Kovak told us you'd be coming today. Would you excuse us, please? I'll be okay. Yeah? (man in suit) I hope you'll find everything to your satisfaction. Your luggage arrived this morning. You'll have all the peace and quiet you need here to write your book. Mr. Kovak especially requested That we prepare one of our bungalows for you. We don't usually accommodate "healthy" guests, so to speak, But in your case, we've made an exception. Mr. Kovak can be very persuasive. And of course, it's an honor for us to be an inspiration to you. Oh. I nearly forgot. The keys to your car. You'll find it parked outside. He's in the middle of a session at the moment. It's rather irregular, but mr. Kovak insisted On speaking with you as soon as you arrived. [beeping] [footsteps] Thank you for coming. How much time have you got left? The important thing is, the time you have left. A long, highly successful life from this moment on. Do you realize the gift I'm giving you? A true story that is pure science fiction, Recounted by its protagonist. You. Something so gripping that people will not be able to put the book down Until the last page. Mm-hm. It does sound like the story of a monster. Write it that way. No one is stopping you. I'll be what you want me to be. I'm in your hands. Let her go, And I'll make you a saint. I know how to do this. See, what we'll do is we'll tell the true story of frank kovak, The brilliant scientist who fell in love with his new homeland. But he was made to do their dirty work. He went a few steps too far, His masters abandoned him, there was no turning back. That's a story. That's a story, you see, Because, then who is the monster, And who is the victim? Do you really believe what you're saying? It doesn't matter what I believe as long as I can write it. That's the problem, david. It's sometime now since you stopped believing in what you do. If you really want to write a great book, You must agonize over every page. No true artist has ever reached his goal, Without going through hell. No, you see, if you want the book to be a success, You have to give the public what they want. So you'll have to provide a final act of redemption. Ahhh. The happy ending. After going through hell, the hero kills the monster. Would that not be happy enough for them? What are you getting at? You have to kill me, david. It's the logical thing to do. After all, I killed jane, Just to get you to join the game. Doesn't it make your blood boil just thinking about it? She seemed to be someone special-- Shut up. You might have shared many things together. Shut up. Maybe for the rest of your lives. [choking] here you can see, killing is not so strange. Ah! You'd like that, wouldn't you? Tell me something. When did it all change for you? When did you stop experimenting with monkeys and start killing people? There. Now you're looking for the character. I'm no saint, david.

Where are the others?! [sirens] (female reporter) bodies are still being discovered, Although so far, there are only seven survivors, Six of whom are in a state of shock. If the testimony of the guide who accompanied the group can be corroborated, This horror could well be confirmed As an inexplicable case of collective suicide. [indistinct] (david) excuse me. (male rescuer) please sir, you shouldn't be here. Remember a girl with long brown hair? Right now, it's impossible to look at anyone. Why don't you speak to the police?

So, what are you going to do? Sit at home, counting the dead? That book is your opportunity to do something. If you don't write it, It will become a cancer gnawing away inside of you. You have a conscience, david. You couldn't live with something like that. Do you really think that you have a choice? [gun cocking] Maybe you're right. I don't think I could live with that. You're not going to do it. And how can you stop me? She's not dead. She's still alive. You're lying. Have I ever lied to you? Something that can be activated, Can also be deactivated. Have you seen her body? Think for a moment. It would have been stupid of me To waste my trump card. I assure you she's alive. Kill me or she'll die. You know I'll do it.
