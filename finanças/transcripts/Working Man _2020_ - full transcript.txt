Hey, Gabe? It's freezing. What did you do, leave the windows open? Gabe? Gabriel? Gabe? Hey, Gabe? Allery... I'll see you after work, okay? Yeah. All employees please report to production coordinator for payment processing... Hey, Walter! What you waiting for, Walt? Not waiting on a thing, I guess. C"mon, Brian, thought you had these things organized. I'm sorry... There's just a lot of... I'm sorry. Sorry. Make us put in half-a-day just to collect our last check. Fuckin' bullshit, you know that? I don't make the policies, Benny. Nah, you just do what they tell you. Look, I'm gonna be outta work same as everybody else, okay, Mendez? Jesus. I'm not going to miss that prick. Just give me a sec. I'll meet you in the office, okay? All right. Allery! Hey, Parkes! Two o'clock is the same as a full day! You're free to leave! Guy knows he's not getting overtime, right? Yeah, he knows. Just been with the company a long time is all. Understatement. The man looks old as dirt. Why'd you keep him on? He had his chance at retirement. He never wanted it. That's too bad for him now, isn't it? Maybe Wal-Mart's hiring. Just see that he's gone when you lock up. Last thing the company needs is for some broken-down geriatric to get left behind. They just tell us three days before the shut down and didn't give us dick for severance. Fuckin' criminals. We had more orders to fill. Now the place is fuckin' empty. And whatta they got but a warehouse of raw material just sitting there. Nothing but a fuckin' waste. What're you going to do, Walt? I don't know. Finish this here, then goin' inside and make my supper. Those men there... Are those cowboys again, Walt? Australian Light Horse Brigade. Birthday gift for my son. No, I mean what're you gonna do? Your plans. I don't know. Haven't made my mind just yet. Well, shit, you only been here but, what, eight-nine months? I'd pack up and move on down the road. We got our whole lives wrapped up in this damn town. Nah, if I was you, Walt, I'd get the fuck outta Dodge. Hm. Are you going on your walk tonight? Yes. Allery? Allery, are you awake? I have my circle today. Then I have... grocery shopping. Your lunch is in the refrigerator. Hey, don't bother. All they got in there is temp work and a two-hour wait. Hell of a line for table scraps. Allery, what are you doing? I'm going to work. Hey, Allery, where you goin', man? Looks like he's going to work. I think he just walked in, Bonnie. Please let me... I'll call you back. Allery, thank goodness. Where have you been all day? I told you. I went to work. - Allery? - Hm? You didn't really go to the factory today, did you? Iola. Have I ever lied to you? No. I'll be home for supper. I think I have that. What to do? Five. Five. There's one... Two... Three... four, five. Right? Hey, hey, look. Here he comes. What did I tell you, guys? Didn't I tell you? Hey, Parkes! What do ya think you're doin'? Allery! Hey, Allery! Where you been all day, man? Just 'cause you dress up for work, doesn't mean they're gonna pay ya! Is everything all right, Allery? Yes. Everything's fine. But then why are you doing this? The factory... I don't understand... It's, uh... It's just something I need to do. Hm. Look it, there he is. He's gonna do it again. Now just what the hell? Man's not all there. He's gonna go off, he's gonna lose it. Time bomb. I'll be damned. I'll get it. So, Allery... How are you? I'm fine. Good, good. Good. I'm very pleased to hear that. Good. You know, we're living in very uncertain times. The factory closing... I know for many folks, plastics was the very heart of this town. So, I don't think you're alone... in facing... Excuse me. I'm sorry? Come again? I said, will you excuse me for a moment? Oh, yes, of course. Thanks again for helping me out, Walter. I really appreciate it. It's hell being married to a bargain shopper. She makes me buy shit we don't even need. He had a son, you know? No. I didn't know that. It was the only child. Had to be in his 30s... Maybe a little older. Couldn't hold a job cause of his behavior. He was real smart, but he just... He had a lot of problems up here, you know what I mean? Are you sure you don't want some breakfast? I could make you eggs. No. No. I don't care for any. Allery, I'm so sorry I called Pastor Mark. I just thought you might like to talk to him... to someone... You should get that. Hello? Bonnie? Oh! The charity drive! I completely forgot. Do you still need blankets? Allery? Okay. Oh. Allery. How you doin'? Everything all right there? I'm okay. Allery, we can't have you in here. We just can't. Hey, check the scanner. Check it for me. Sure. They shouldn't bring a man like that home. That ain't where he belongs. Mr. Parkes. I don't wanna have to do this again. Oh, you're back. That's a nice surprise... Allery. Allery, someone's at the back door. You want in that factory? I'll get ya in there. Ain't nobody got to know, neither. Gordman gave me this spare set of masters when we was makin' them window latches back in August. He forgot he done it. And I didn't bother to remind him. Is that what you've been doing in here? Cleanin'? Why ain't ya fired one up yet? Ain't nobody gonna hear you in here. No power. - You tried the breakers? - Yeah. Line's connected! Department of Water and Power? Yes, this is Stan Gordman, New Liberty Plastics. We shut down operations here at the factory, the one off Clayton Road. Thing is, I still got a bunch of folks trying to perform maintenance, - but we got no electricity. - Oh, well... Bonnie, it's so nice of you to come by for the donations, I just couldn't leave the house. Well, I got the blanket... Iola, I heard about Allery. Are you okay? Thought you might have lit out on me. Break time, I see. Suppose I oughta have me a little break myself. I didn't pack nothin'. Go ahead, I'll be fine. Much obliged. - Thank you. - Hm-hm. Things were different way back then. Before Gabe got sick. Allery use to come home from work, we'd get a sitter, and we'd go over to Tipton, it's a supper club out there. - The Starliter. - Hmm. Yep. I remember they used to serve peas and potatoes. It was in their Mexican food. It's all Mexican food over there now. There was also dancing. Three times a week and the weekends. We'd go there all the time. You and Allery? Yeah. Oh, I know he doesn't look like it now, but... back then he was light on his feet. I was terrible. He was a wonderful lead. Your voice. It's different. You know that? I been working aside you now, what, eight months, and 'til today, I ain't never heard you talk. Now, when I hear you, the voice don't match the face. Not a bad thing, just not what I expected, is all. Look at that, huh? Look at that. The way he held me close... It was perfect. But now... It's like... he forgot all the steps. And I don't know what move he's gonna make next. Thinks he's... He's just not the man I married. Oh. They never are. These machines here are built for use, not to shine up like some rich man's show car. We came here to work! Let's go to work! You're staying? Liverwurst, huh? It's braunschweiger. Didn't know they still made this stuff. What do you want? Ain't my place to be picky. Beggars can't be choosers. No. Why are you here? Same thing as you, I imagine. Where else we got to go? That was the best day of work I've had in a long, damn time. How 'bout tomorrow? The man who came here this morning... the man who you left with today. Wow, the bachelor, Walter Brewer. Who went to the old Watsons' house. I don't know. You don't know? I don't know his name. You were with him at the factory all day - and you don't know his name? - Yes. - No. - No? Yes, no? No you don't? No. I don't. And all day you work with him. Yes. What do the two of you do there? It's just... Just what we've always done. Go on. Warm the truck up. You can drive home. No. I-I'd rather not... I don't drive anymore. We're just down the road. I trust you. Okay, wagons ho. Hey! Why don't you and your wife come over tonight, have supper with me this evening? My... My wife usually... You tell her... - What's your wife's name? - Iola. Iola! Supper will be ready in an hour. Don't have to bring a thing! I don't like this. We don't know this man very well. You don't know him at all. I know he has a beard. My mother told me, "Be wary of men with beards." Why? Because they have something to hide. What about Jesus? Iola! Pleasure to meet you! Come in! I got me battles that go way back. Got my first set at a swap meet years ago. Been doin' them ever since. It keeps the body occupied. You say you were married? Oh, yes, ma'am. Cecilia and I were married for... twenty-four years. Three kids together. Ray, Robert, and Rachel. They're out there doing their own things now. I'm very proud of them. Your wife? Where is she now? Iola... Cecilia passed away a year before I moved up here. I'm... No-no, it's okay. She got the cancer. She fought hard, but, in the end, it was... just too much. Leaving there was a good thing for me. Change in surroundings and all. Yeah, I was kinda hoping this town would be a place a man can... settle into. You understand? Like, uh, a place to call home. Okay. Iola? Would you care to lead us in grace? Uh, you want me to say the blessing? Yes, ma'am. You do believe in Jesus, don't you? - What do you think? - Mm, oh! It looks bad... You know, I've never had that. Depends on how you eat it. You got a bit of an appetite on you. - Hm. - Hm-hm. - Excuse me. - Where did you learn to cook down South? I beg your pardon. Excuse me. I just want to get some water. Of course. Lemme get that for you... Oh no, I'll get it myself. Hmm. I'm going to go wash up. Yeah. Just there to your left. Yeah, okay. Oh, yes. This does look to be something special... nothin' quite like a peach pie made from scratch... Ain't that right? So what are they? Your intensions. Your intensions at that factory with my husband? I'm not sure I know what you mean, ma'am. Well whatever it is you have in mind, I wish you'd go on and do it. Just do it and move on and leave my husband be. We don't need any more trouble. Well, ma'am, I... Oh, thank you. Thank you. That was very good. You're welcome. Havin' the Parkes over for dinner. That's kinda... Kinda unexpected. So is seeing you leave early in the morning and not come back home 'til after dark. You know somethin'? When I was a boy, there was... six, seven... big plants in this town. New Liberty... She was the last one. When that factory opened there was... damn near 500 employees, then the layoffs came, then it dropped down to a hundred workers, 50... Shit. The companies and the politicians... They say they're gonna take of us. Fuck that. Thing is, a person needs a job... to survive but, You... you need work to feel like you're worth something. Why don't you tell me what the hell is going on, Walt? Allery. He's at the front. Why are you... People will see... This is a small town, Allery. It's Hard to keep secrets around here. I'm afraid our neighbors caught wind of what we been up to. Oh, well, that's it then. Ah, no... It's just startin'. Sure got a lot of folks wanting in that factory this morning. Yes, sir, hell of a situation. You did this? Nuh-uh, no not me. They're out here 'cause of you. Ain't very polite to keep 'em all waitin'. They ain't gonna arrest us all, Allery. Ain't that right, ma'am? Hey! We gonna do this thing or what? What did you tell these people? I just told 'em what we been workin' on. The deals you made. I didn't make any deals. I mean, not directly, but without you, I wouldn't have thought of it. I figured what with all the surplus in the warehouse, our buyers needed to be informed... To understand that'd cost them more to go somewhere else... ...than if they'd just stick with us. After a few phone calls with them. We made an agreement. What kind of agreement? That if we finish up the orders left undone... If we complete our contracts our buyers will compensate us for it. Ain't a person in here who can't use that money. The buyers also agreed to lean on the big wigs at corporate. - I don't follow. - To keep the factory open. Give us some leverage. All we gotta do is hold up our end and meet deadline. Deadline? What deadline? When the factory closed, we had us five open and unfinished contracts. Five. Now, by my math, we should be able to fill those orders in one week. I mean if the Good Lord could make all of creation in six days, I'll be damned if we can't handle a couple orders in seven. Keep comin'. My man! Boss says take it down there. Besides, it's not like we're stealing. We're just gettin' paid for the work we do... Work that was comin' to us. Corporate will still get theirs. We don't have permission to do this. If the company finds out they're not gonna let us back in here. Oh, they"re gonna find out. We're going to make damn good sure of that. We ain't leavin'. Okay... in three, two, one. A week ago, New Liberty Plastics abruptly halted operation and closed the doors of its Clayton Road manufacturing facility. But to look inside the factory today... Everything is running full speed ahead. New Liberty's former workers have re-entered the plant and have pledged to stay at their jobs, assuring that in one week's time, they'll fulfill the outstanding orders promised to the factory's clients. - Hey, that's us! Benny, we're on TV! - Yeah-yeah, I know, shh. The workers have also vowed to occupy and not leave the facility in an effort to pressure New Liberty's parent company, Hatwell Corporation, to come to the table and potentially re-open the factory. - Fuck yeah. - That's right. We want the company to know that it ain't right what they done. You just can't up and take away things from good people like this. We just want what's fair. Brian, I'm watching it. Why the hell do you think I called you? What? No! No, no. No cops. No, no don't let Frank know. Tell him to call again. Jesus, this thing is bad enough. Look it, uh... You got that number for corporate legal? Mr. Parkes, what would you like to tell your former employer? - Hey, it's Allery! - Shh-shh-shh. What is it you want to say? Mr. Parkes... I just want to do my job. Thank you, Brandon. Brandon on location at New Liberty Plastics... Y'all bring everything in here. We'll find a place for it. God bless it, look at all this stuff. Oh, let me help you with that. Right. Thank you. There we go. There we go. Don't be shy, come on in here. There we go. They're right over there. How you doin'? I usually walk at night. Still have a lot of food left if you're hungry. Shouldn't keep a good woman waitin'. Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late. I didn't know what they were feeding you here, so I made you something you'd eat. And, uh, a pie for your friend Walter. He liked it so much. And, a bed roll. There's a pillow in here. It's the one from your side of the bed. And pajamas and clean clothes, your working clothes. Yes, I should go. Iola... Iola. Here you go, Allery. I called in a favor from Howard... There at the army surplus downtown. I think that's a good one. I hope it sleeps okay for you. Oh, this will be fine. - Yeah. Thank you. - Yeah. Oh, no. Why did you tell everyone... this was my idea? These folks need to look to one of their own. Not to some Johnny-come-lately like me. I also don't like seein' a man get judged, least not without walking some in that man's shoes. Hey, Gabe! It's freezing. What did you do, leave the windows open? Gabe? Hey, Gabe? Gabe? Jesus! Oh, my God! No! No! No, no, no! Come on, you okay? No! No! Oh, my God! Why did... Why did you... Why did you do this? My boy. No... Allery? Allery? You okay? You all right? My son... My... My son... I was... I was too late... And I lost him. I know. I know all about that. Hey, mornin'. Good morning. Oh, shoot. I just had my coupons... They're here somewhere I... Don't sweat it. I got you covered. Um... What they're doin' down at the factory... That's bad ass. It's sunshine, boys. What the hell is this? Found them. They was in storage. I'm guessing you're about a size, uh... medium. We're a team here. A unified front. Let's start looking the part. Ain't that right, chief? Here you go. Here you go. Comin' at ya. - Number B. - Number B. - I got a pair of sixes. - Pair of five... That's... Jacks on three. That's like, three in a row already! This guy... I score! Shit. All right, here's a two... ...I'm going for four. All right. - Nothing? - Nah. I got... I got... three Jacks. Damn, Allery! Four. You know, I'm never inviting you over to my place for poker night. I'm sorry. Marg, you're a shitty player, you can come over anytime. Screw you. Hey, where did you learn to play cards? - Grandmother. - Oh, yeah? Well she must have been a hell of a player 'cause she taught you well. Allery? You think we'll hear something soon from the brass? Uh, I'm not sure... Soon as Allery hears, he'll let everybody know. Right, but we're three days in now and me and some of the others workers were trying to figure out when we... I said soon as he hears! Can someone turn that goddamn thing off? Christ. So we playing or what? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no. Ante up. Ante up, guys, let's go. Every time you deal, I get shit for cards. Oh, it's not the cards, baby. It's the dumbass who's playing 'em. Screw you. Again. Wonderin' when you were gonna get your ass up. You can sleep when you're dead. We got work to do. Come on. Here we go. I've been asked to deliver this on behalf of the Hatwell Corporation. Head office. What the hell's in it for you, Gordman? Why you throwing in with them? Cause it could mean some work on the other side of this thing, that's why. Hatwell might be buying out the sheet metal plant over in Grundy. Shit, that's just rumor and you know it. Rumor's are a hell of a lot better than make-believe. And for the life of me, I don't get what you all think you're accomplishing here. You're following the lead of some lost and confused old man? It makes no goddamn sense... We don't need you! You hear me?! We don't need you! We don't need you! I advise you to do what they say. We all knew this was comin'. This is how the game's played. We stick to our guns, we'll be fine. The buyers are with us. I'm betting them folks over there at corporate will cave before we even finish the jobs. We ain't gonna finish nothin' in here with no power. You know, it's supposed to get damn cold tonight. Look, they're just tryin' to muscle us. They won't let us freeze. Guarantee you that. Well this here says we're trespassing. Says we have to be out by 8:00 A.M. tomorrow or they're gonna call the law to come in here and start making arrests. That's bullshit. They're not gonna do that. And what if they do? Now it's one thing to lose your job... it's a whole other one to go to jail. I got kids at home. I understand that. How you think that's gonna make 'em look? Folks at home watching TV, seeing a bunch of unemployed factory workers getting dragged off in handcuffs? Company don't want that, I promise you. I respect what you're all tryin' to do here. But I'm out. Yeah, me, too. Look, I need work now. I can't afford to wait. I'm sorry. People, look, this is all a bluff. And we need to call them on it. send 'em a message sayin', that if they don't give us back our power, then we're fixin' to make calls of our own. To the real news. Not this local station shit. I'm talkin' the big boys. Networks. Social media. Show the world! Right? Each and everyone of you. We should put it to a vote. I wanna hear what Allery thinks. We stay. I got a couple more gas generators coming. They're from Smitty's. Says they're good motors. Durable. I got another one comin' from the VFW. Only 13 horse though. I can scare up one more if we need it. I know they got one over at the Elks Lodge. Allery, you want me to go see about that generator at the Elks? Yeah. Yeah... G-Get what you can. And, um, check... check the back room. They kept the lost-and-found back there. Might be some extra coats and gloves. - Yeah, good idea. - All right. Hello? Walter? What are you doing in here? All these old, used up machines... Each one... did what they was built for, then they was tossed aside. Tossed aside! Yeah, well, nobody gives a shit! Jesus... Whoops. That wasn't supposed to happen, was it? Hey, hey. What the hell's goin' on in here? Oh, Jesus! He just... He just had too much to drink. All right, his cut doesn't look that deep. Come on. Let's clean him up and help him to bed. - I'm walking. - Come on, take it easy, Walter. Come on. He just had too much to drink, that's all! Fuckin' quitters. Hey... They flinched. You're damn right they did. Ha-ha! Son-of-a-bitch backed down! The buyers are leaning on 'em! They buckled! Ah, now they know it, by God! They know it, now they got a fight on their hands! They got a fight on their hands! Yeah, they got a fight on their hands! Ah, lookey who's here! Just stay where you are. You don't come near me, understand? Your boys are nervous, huh? We got our power back. 'Cause they don't want your asses to freeze... You're a liability in this place. Look, they, uh... they want to talk. - Today. - Yeah, I bet they do. I'll tell you what, Stan. Why don't you crawl back and tell 'em if they wanna negotiate, they know exactly where to find us. They only want to talk to him. Well. Allery Parkes. You've really started something here, haven't you? This statement of yours is all everyone at HQ is talking about. I'm not making any statement. Oh, but you are, Mr. Parkes. Now clearly you have earned the allegiance of your co-workers. And I can assure you, you have our attention as well. In particular, you have mine. See, it's my job is to make sure that the company's transitions or in the case of your factory, its closures, go smoothly. And you, Mr. Parkes, are making closure notably difficult. How well do you know Walter Brewer? Your neighbors tell me that he's the one that assisted you into the factory, that he helped you persuade the other workers to join you there. I didn't persuade anybody to do anything. I believe you, Mr. Parkes. How long have you known him? What are you asking me exactly? A third cup, please. There's somebody you need to meet. Step this way. Mr. Parkes, this is Cecilia Brewer. Walter Brewer's wife. Former. Of course. My mistake. Walter was always real good at hiding his problems from folks at work. At least until all the trouble started. And, with Walter, the trouble always started. Man's changed jobs and addresses more than most people change their mind. When Walter's moods were bad, he would drink a bottle of vodka a day. In high times, he'd be a ball of fire. Never even need any sleep. On low days, he could barely get out of bed. He ever seek treatment? Walter tried everything. But when he'd feel good, he'd go off his pills. Said he didn't need the help. That's when everything would go south. I'm sorry, but... Aside from... your husband lying about your existence, what does any of this have to do with me? He don't know? Mr. Parkes, Your pal Walter, contacted a half dozen of old buyers to reinitiate and complete old deals. Yeah, well, we're doing that. We're filling those orders. Mr. Parkes, none of those customers accepted Walter's offer. That's not right. They said that if we finished the work, they would honor those contracts. Then they would pay us and then they would help us keep the factory open... Mr. Parkes. There's no money, no new contracts. There're no deals. There never were any. The only deals that existed were in Mr. Brewer's unfortunate imagination. Mr. Parkes, there is no work to be done. In here... are the names and numbers of clients that had accounts with the factory before the closure. Take it. Call them if you like. It ain't the first time Walter's played with the truth. But putting a whole factory of people back to work? That is something else. I used to ask myself, why he was like this? What was the reason why he acted the way he acted? I even wondered if I did something wrong. But I finally figured out that there was no reason. It was just who he was. Walter tell you we had children? He's done that before. Fact is, he could never settle on the idea. Wouldn't risk it. Afraid he was gonna pass on his troubles to someone else. Someone innocent. The children he told you about... they were the family we never had. I suppose it's the same reason... why he said I died. It's easier to, uh, invent stories than live with the truth. Look, I need to go. I've got a plane to catch. Yeah, right. You must be some... Some kinda big man for them to fly me all the way here just to talk to you. Oh, I'm not... I'm not a big man. Well, Walter must think so. I... I understand, you know. I understand why you needed to leave him. I didn't leave. I would've never... He was the love of my life. Walter's the one that left. Said I deserved better. That he didn't want to see me hurt no more. When he was his true self... Walter was the greatest man I ever known. That, you can believe. I'm sorry about that back there. Corporate just thought you might need some additional persuasion. Mr. Parkes? Yep. Look, the company's prepared to offer you and the other workers a revised severance. It's not much of a deal, but it's better than nothing. Allery, you've got to tell the other workers the truth. I mean, if you don't, we will. But either way, all of this... It's finished. Nice view from the boss's desk, huh? I think it suits you. Is that what you think? Why did you do this? I know about the orders. What are you talking about? The wages, the contracts. The buyers. The buyers that we do not have. I see. Them company men they gave you some line, tryin' to shake your faith, is that it? Well, I know how to fix that. I'm gonna show you the contracts... to put an end to this right here, right now. All right? - Now, the paper work... - No. Was here. I know they're around here somewhere. - Stop. - I know they're somewhere around here. I just got to find them is all... Just stop! They're misplaced is all. Oh, hell with it, look, contracts or no contracts, what's it matter? We're makin' them orders. They'll need to pay us. They'll need to reopen the factory. You know that's not going to happen. Course it is. We just all hold together and finish what we started. They're not going to reopen! They're not going to do anything! They told me the truth. The truth... Ha! That's their truth. Oh, hey, we've created our own. Look at what we're doing here. We're doin' something great. We're makin' somethin' from nothing... Enough! Enough lies! We was doin' our jobs and that company pulled everything from under us. We did what we was told and they robbed us of what we had and who we were. Bet your last dollar, our work was shipped overseas before the doors here was even closed. But who gives a damn? No one. Who gives a damn if what we're doin' now makes any sense? Fact is, when nothin' in the world makes sense, it feels good to just let it happen. It feels good to just ride with the madness. And don't pretend you don't know that. 'Cause you know that better than any of us. I know when enough is enough. Yeah, coming from you, that'd be a hell of a thing to hear. What they need to hear... is the truth. Yeah, that. Don't let me stop you. You can keep the keys. Y'all are makin' a big mistake, you hear me? Y'all are makin' a big mistake! They ain't going to take our jobs and they ain't takin' our factory! They ain't doin' nothing! We gotta wait 'em out, Wait for the big news trucks to come! You watch 'em! You watch 'em shake then! All this work we've done... One more day we can finish it! One more day we prove we was right! We don't need the company! We don't need nobody! Look, we stay here, we become heroes, right? Heroes! We stay here we make them give it all back! You leave now, you leave as cowards! You hear me? Cowards! You leave as cowards! You hear me? Shit! Shit! What's goin' on? So, what happened? You gotta give me something, man. I'm dyin' out here... It's over. They made a deal. A deal? The company. They made an offer. To everyone. Isn't that what you wanted? Well it's... It's what they gave us. Well, what does Walter think? It doesn't matter. The deal's done. Well, he must have an opinion. I mean, he's helped to start all this. What he thinks doesn't matter. We took it. It's over. It's... It's done. And I... I... He's not who I... He's not who I thought he was. I... I don't understand... Well, there are problems. He's got problems that I didn't know about. He's just, um, I don't... He's just not right. He's not what he's supposed to be. So you just left him? I told you, it's over. The work was over... Yeah but he believed in you. He helped you. I never asked for his help. Yeah but he gave you the... What you wanted. You wanted the factory. He got the factory, he gave you everyone's respect... The job... was not real. It was real! It was real! All this talk about Walter and his problems? Maybe you didn't know, but I did. Do you know that night at his house? I saw his medications. They were the same as Gabe's. Allery, doesn't that feel familiar to you? I'm not talking about this anymore. Don't you walk away from me! Not this time! You do. You just... you just disappear! You're not there! I am! I was! I did what I needed to do. What is it you needed to do? I needed to work! All you needed was to escape! That's what you would do. Going to the factory! All those late night walks! You just didn't want to be here! You didn't want to be here. Gabe got sick, and had to come home from school and he had to leave his music... - He failed. - He didn't fail. He was just afraid and he needed you to talk to him. I was providing for us. So that we could we take care of our son... And I was... I don't know, I was... Allery, I can't be dead anymore. I have to live. I have to be alive. Because that's what's right for Gabe. Huh? I hear it. It's Walter. He didn't come home last night. The man ain't left the factory yet. He's still there? The Sheriff's on his way over there. Roger heard it on his scanner. Stan Gordman called it in, he said Walter won't leave. Something's gone wrong, Allery. Walt's gotta get the hell outta there. Allery. Allery, do you understand what's happening? Allery, the law's on their way over there. Someone's gonna get hurt. There needs to be more than three in there. This guy is insane. - Wait! - What the hell are you doing here, Parkes? I thought we resolved all this. No, no. Look. Let me go in. Let me talk to him. Allery, you've already done plenty. Don't do this. Listen, just stand back and let these men do their jobs. This job isn't theirs! Please. Allery! Come here! We need these orders filled today! Come on, I need you! Come on, we're behind! You hear me? Well, come here, gimme a hand! - Okay here. - Yeah, yeah. Gimme a hand! Hey, come on! It's a busy morning, huh? Damn sure it is! Hey, um, how bout we knock off a few hours early? Today? Today's deadline! We got orders to meet! I know, it's just a break! You know, like we always do! Got no time for that! We gotta finish what we started here! Wait, just listen to me! Wait, wait, wait a second! Wait, huh? We need to keep movin'! Can't take time to settle down! No! No! No! We don't belong here! We don't belong here! Neither one of us! The work is over. It's time... It's time to move on, Walter. Now that's... the first time you've called me by name. You know that? Not too long today, okay? All right. Lindbergh? Spirit of St. Louis. I brought your mail. In a couple of weeks you'll be back home. This, uh... This is also yours. From, uh, New Liberty. From Corporate. Is it a summons? It's a check. For your labor... plus a brokerage fee. A few of our former buyers, the ones that you called, they caught wind of what we had done at the factory, they contacted the head office and bought up a lot of a... work we did. They bought our work. Factory's still closing but you were right, Walter. They wanted our work. You were right. That wife of yours make anymore of that peach pie? Oh, yeah. Plus a few other things. You know she spoils me. Yes. Well... best we eat it. Hate to disappoint the poor woman. Don't get any pie on your brokerage fee. Did I give you enough time with him? - Yeah? - Yeah. Would you like me... Would you like me to drive? - Yes. - Is that a yes? - Hm. - Yeah?
