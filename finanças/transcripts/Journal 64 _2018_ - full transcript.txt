You are there and whores with your cousin? - Stop! - You just stay there. This has consequences. I can tell you that! - Come with me. - Neat! I pat you the power ones one, If you follow me. - Ouch! Let go of me! - Shut up. Carl. Carl. I read what you wrote about me in your recommendation. Was it too much? "Assad has since 2013 worked for me at Section Q. He has done the work as expected. Carl Mørck. " Five years, Carl. Was it the best you could say? It does not matter. You've got the job. (cafeteria ninner) Pardon! - It's a workplace, this one. - Hey ... - I'm going to smoke. - Carl, I have one week left in Q. - Are you okay with me going away? - Yes. You've been in that cellar long enough. Isn't that strange, we should not work together? We are colleagues at a police station. In a year we will not greet the canteen. In five years, one says: "Do you remember Carl Mørck?" Then just spend a second, before clicking. Colleagues at a police station? Is that what we are? Yes. But I will miss they there dog eyes. - Good, you get rid of them. - Perfect. You are fucking miserable to the most common human relations. On the contrary. I see it all shining clear. It is frustrating. You win, Carl. Sleep well. - Aren't you coming down? - No. - We have a chair for you. - Shut up. What should we talk about? (car pushing) Keep your fucking shut, okay! Should I Smash Your Teeth? - Where are they ugly. - Pardon. I'm going to shit it. Nothing is more annoying, than when people are not driving green. Maybe just rockers. bikers is really fucking robotic. What are you saying to me? Your little fucking fool! Do you want something? What are you doing? Your fool, man! Fuck you, man! Come on. Off. Hello, Nete. Gitte Charles. It's me who takes you to Sprogø. Yes. - Yes, Miss Charles. - Yes, Miss Charles. - Are you okay? - Yes. Come.

Normally we ask for CPR number, but you agree, - - That operation will be done anonymously. If you dress and make yourself ready, I come in and pick you up. There is something wrong with the drawings. I've seen people build crazy walls, but never a walled room. 20 years in the real estate industry. There is Not something that can surprise me. I've seen everything. Maybe I should wait. I'm feeling Don't feel safe here. All alone. Nour, it's gonna go. And you confirm that you are still Want your pregnancy stopped? Yes. It is the one with whom it is crazy. It is good enough. It's hollow. You just go crazy, Torsten. - Then it's gone through. - Stop right. Let me see. If I have to say it myself, I am incredibly easy to work with. You have been most in the traffic service. There is not much clarification work. I have a dog's nose for details. When my lady has thrown a piece of jewelry away or something. Bum. It's always me who finds it. Even as a kid I could designate the killer on television. "It's the killer." "They haven't said that yet." Bingo. It is always the disabled person. - I have all Barnaby on Blu-ray. - And why just Department Q? You write, It could be the perfect match. Just between us, have I heard that with, - - that it's about driving things Right after the book is not you. Throw away the book. It's totally me. Fuck the book. - Am I disturbing you? - No. Hi, Back. Come on in. Thank you for coming. - Do I get an answer by email or ...? - No. Well, we call. - Are there many applicants? - No. Thank you for coming. - Have you already found a new Assad? - Carl doesn't like anyone. Don't take him there. He is piss-irritating. So I didn't read him at all. Thanks for the tip. - Can we help you? - I just have to check the files. I've been in the lead the biggest murder case of the century. I'll check if we have similar cases from before my time. They were found in an apartment this morning. Holy shit. - You got the case at the lakes? - Yes. Sound not so surprised. I can not Find around your system. Is it online or down here? Where are you going? Carl. That's my case. Carl! - What happens? - The idiot tries to take over my case. Don't get annoyed at he always goes in the middle of a conversation? Carl! What happens? Behind says you take his case. He will never Could lift such a big job. The man has used letters in a sudoku. - What are you doing? - I still have one week left. - Who owns the apartment? - Hey, Gunnar. - At the back, are you here? - He asked me to look at the case. - Couldn't just overlook it. - A Gitte Charles is a tenant. The phone number of the lease does not work. Holy shit. You may want to hear the menu? We have embalmed penis with testicles. Here we have the ovary. And over here ... abdomen. - Can I borrow the? - Yes go ahead. Fuck, man. What is that? A love key. It symbolizes, You have the key to someone else's heart. There is a heart at the top. Worthless. Are you sure? - I've had one. - You have? Give me that. - And the chair was like that? - Yes, the chair was overturned. There should have been one more. Gab a little higher. A little further out with the tongue. Yes, you are healthy and healthy, Nete. When did you last had menstruation? How do you see your future, Nete? I'm going to marry Tage, when he turns 18 in a year. - Take ... it's your cousin? - My girlfriend. - We are getting married. - Yes. And what about children? Tage comes from a family with many siblings. We must have at least four. Tage plans to become a doctor or lawyer for having so many? He helps his father in the yard. Next year he has to go fishing, so he can get his own cutter. His own cutter. Let me show you something. Here I show all the new girls, coming to the island. Come on, come on. Come. Sit down. What do you see? The... - They are dead. - Yes, they are dead. But what more? They have preserved their dignity. You can see that, right? It's very important, Nete. That's what we're trying to do to help you here. To restore your dignity. For we must all be able to contribute to the new welfare society. Can you understand that? It's not about you or about me, but about us. - Doctor Wad, that's dinner. - Thank you, sweet Gitte. Nete. Your father has given the home full authority over you. There are many years before I judge, You are mature enough to come home. So you might as well forget about Tage. For your own sake. Thank you, Gitte. Welcome to the news on TV2, - - where we open today an eerie discovery in Copenhagen. What have you found? Craftsmen made a macabre find in this property in the middle of Copenhagen. Three almost mummified corpses set around a dining table. I'm here with Kjeld Sørensen, administrator - - and first man on the spot. What are you thinking? I've never seen anything like it. The police give scant information, - - But we can understand that the hunt for the offender is in full swing. Nete ​​Hermansen. Dead as 60-year-old. The body is drained of liquid, - - and a mummification process has preserved the body in desiccated form. The internal organs are removed, the abdomen is cut out - - and stored in a separate glass mounting with ethanol. - Do we know the cause of death? - Overdose of Hyoscyamus niger. Henbane. Originally used on the first Arab hospitals as stunning. Also used in German beer until the 16th century. In small doses a drug. The central nervous system is paralyzed larger amounts for a painful death. The question is whether the genitals are removed after death. - Or ... - While still alive? Yes. It's not for kids, friends. What do you think? So many years of planning. There is so much hate in that crime scene. We have not been overlaid with it one unsolved case after another, - Since we created Department Q? It's not Department Q's case. It's a 12 year old case with embalmed corpses. It says Q written with disaster types. The press covers 24 hours a day. Any article with "mummy" The headline gets thousands of clicks. - Tell me we have a suspect. - We were investigating ... The lessee. And Gitte Charles. Retired nurse. Lighthouse from Holbæk Hospital after aggressive behavior. She also worked for a bedridden and can embalise. Okay! It is then promising. Do we know where she is? Niksen. No one has seen her for years. But the rent was paid on time every month. Niksen? I'm trying to get it a little Danish snake into my language. Get Gitte Charles called for. - It's already done. - And the victims? All three bodies had health insurance cards or driver's license. - It was then easy for once. - Nete Hermansen, disappeared in 2005. A Philip Nørvig, disappeared in 2006. The second woman's driving license is too blurred. - But we run infrared and uv on it. - It could be Gitte Charles. She murdered the others, and then she killed herself. Just give it a few seconds. Why? You've heard that before. She killed herself and groomed inside? From the outside. Philip Nørvig. Why does he say something to me? Because you had the case. It was closed after a few weeks. That's right then right. We didn't let the case fall because the wife said he got rid of another? - Yeah. - He wasn't so. We start with the wife. Assad? Close the door. I think you need it the rest of the time here on your new job. I should be here the last week. - It has been my home for five years. - You want to be there for Carl. But think of yourself and your future. Job at the baker's police is not hanging on the trees. Especially if you ... Especially not for people with brown eyes and fun accent. I'm ready on Monday. Do you think the wife lied? It wouldn't be the first time a woman has lied about her husband. - Mie Nørvig? - Yes. Hey. Do you have five minutes? It's about your husband, Philip. See you later. Yes? 12 years ago you told that yours man was traveling with a mistress. - Why? - Maybe you should just sit down. His body was found in an apartment this morning. He has been dead for 12 years. What? It can not be true. Is that all, they talk about in the press? He's just been dead in all those years? First, you reported him missing. Then you told the police that he was escaped. Why change history? - I got a mail from him. - You got an email? Yes. About 14 days later he had disappeared. He had fallen in love with another, and I should not look for him. So you just let him be? After what? 40 years of marriage? 30th - Did you save that mail? - No. My son... Our son found out it came from an internet café in Malaga. - Gitte Charles, does that tell you anything? - No, I think not. Here's what we have on her. Residence, workplaces. Is there anything, who connects her with Philip? Sprogø. The female home at Sprogø. She was employed there from 1958 to 61. So what? There was a lot ... lawsuits against the women's home, after the closed. I think, Philip was defending one of them. - Which one? - I do not know. You never asked for it in your 30 year marriage? Thanks for the help. An email from Philip sent from Spain? Philip went to dinner in Copenhagen. With their own testicles as the main dish. - What about the Sprogø connection? - I just sent it to Rose. - Nete buns his cousin. - Quietly! You share a room with Rita. - Are you stupid or horny? - What do you mean? Why are you here? Because you are stupid, or because you are horny? I just love to take. You say nothing to anyone about this. The fishermen come by once in a while with forbidden goods. - If we give them a little in return. - Like what? - What is it? - You have nice eyes. I will take care of you. - When do they get the water damage? - We have the last victim. Prostitute Rita Nielsen. She was reported missing in 2006 of a brothel on Funen. And the connection to Sprogø? I found no Sprogø trial, where Philip Nørvig was a lawyer. Maybe the widow remembers wrong. Summarize a list of everyone on the island, when Gitte Charles was employed. What was with that island? It was a home for women with mental problems. According to the male-dominated society. A prison for women, which the state did not find decent. When I as a teenager was hysterical, said my father: "Be glad you were born now. Otherwise you ended up at Sprogø. " - Idiot. - We didn't know you as a child. Maybe you were unbearable to be together with. - Don't smoke in here. - Don't you want to miss this? Ping-ping back and forth, Carl and Assad? - This ping-ping? - I got hold of the police in Malaga. Gitte Charles has a Malaga address and a Spanish bank account, - - which every six months has transferred money to the apartment. Why do you tell first the most important thing now? If I start with the most important thing, then you are immediately Carl Mørck - - and must call to important people. - And then I can't talk to finish. - Carl Mørck. I'll talk to ... I called. Spanish police is coming out to pick her up. It does not matter. Well. Gitte Charles kills Nete, Rita and Philip. Then she brushes the room on travel to Spain. Then she sends mail to the Philips wife and get the hunt off for him. Since no one misses the two girls, the case is never investigated. - We're just missing ... - A motif. A connection between Gitte Charles and the three died. - Wait. I have the key. - Come on. Open up. It's the police. Is there anyone at home? It's the police. - Is there anybody? - Please go. Charles wasn't in the apartment and closed her Spanish account today. She knows we are after her. We need to expand the search. Interpol, airlines, trains. Airports, international buses. Border crossings. Taxis in both Spain and Copenhagen. Do you hear? Yes, I hear. (humming) Carl! You were right. Sprogø connects Given Charles with the victims. We're going over there now. Come. Nete ​​Hermansen and Rita Nielsen were patients. Gitte Charles was employed. All together from 1960 to 1961. I still haven't found anything who connects Charles with Nørvig. - Rose Knudsen? - It is me. We had an appointment at 15.30. It is now 15.37. It is deeply unprofessional when one have come from Copenhagen to open. We can't reach it all now. Say where to start. - Where do we start? - Grow there bulmeurt at Sprogø? Yes. Follow me. We are in the night shadow family. Bulmeurt and potatoes are related. Come on, feel it! The girls on the island used it as a drug. I thought you could die of it. You can die of everything too big amounts. Coffee, avocado, strawberries. A smaller amount of bulb is similar to take mushrooms or smoke hash. I smoke some hash in high school, but then I got an anxiety attack ... Oh boy. Should we leave? Not many of the girls failed anything. It was a prison for liberals women. So-called moral weakness. A final seizure of the state in the totalitarian alignment of the 50s. This was one of the girls' room. It seems trustworthy, until you get deeper. How was the relationship between the girls and the employees? The girls were prisoners. The staff were prisoners. If you were a girl, it wasn't one bad place for a female employee. It was here they had common eating and morning singing. it comes from the beautiful coast I hate this room. Yes come. Come come come. Come on, hell. It was incredible then. Here they came down when they should be punished. Report space. They were strapped and laid in for several days without food. There are stories about a girl, who tried to run away, - who stayed here for two weeks. It is insane that the state never have apologized to the women. It is correct. They are afraid of damages. Many of the cases did not come to court. - What did you say? - They didn't come to court. The judges rejected the cases in closed hearings. Stupid pig! So the hearings would not stand in the police archives? - But there were lawyers present? - Philip Nørvig. The National Archives must have the records. Have I asked about your closing time? Am I interested in it? Rose, what is it? - Are you okay? - It is nothing. The... - I just got a deal tonight. - Well! - Good luck. - Thanks. I never forgive you, just so you know. You leave me alone with the sour asshole. I have to move on. You persuaded me to stay for your sake. You were the only one Carl had in his life, and I was vital. I thought he would change, but no. "I don't need you, Assad." "Do you call this coffee? Was it only me who took my brain today? " - I will miss you. - Come here. Am i the only one, who took the brain? It was the National Archives. We can see the case files immediately. - If you have time. - I have. Here. A woman tried to lay case against a doctor at Sprogø. Curt Wad. - What? - What? - Curt what? - What? That's his name. Curt Wad. Philip Nørvig was defense lawyer for Curt Wad. The judge did not think that was led proof. The case never came to court. What was the matter about? She claimed that Wad had forced her sterilized. I can't find the name of the woman in the documents we have. - We must get hold of the doctor. Wad. - Yes. Seriously? Before hell. As you all know, I swear to science. But I still want to end with a prayer. Never before have we helped so many, - - there before could not have children. We're talking about the digital age, - - And we can talk about it the fertile age. A healthy woman of 50 with strong genes - - can today become an equally good mother like a young woman of 25. In many other countries you are longer political advance, - - and therefore it must be my prayer to the state, our politicians, - that you remove the age restriction on our treatments. Let's keep your finger on the pulse of life. Thank you, Curt. Inspirational. He is also a mixed pleasure. (mobile calling) I just have to take it. Pardon. - It's Rose Knudsen. - It's Brandt from Sprogø. I have some important information. I can meet tomorrow on a neutral basis. Harbor ticket between 12.14 and 12.16. Don't get too late. You have to tell me what it is about. Never in life. Do you know how many people are listening on a normal phone call? Pardon. It was just work. Your safety valve too to get out of this date. No, it was just work. A crazy supervisor from Sprogø. Okay. So you stay? Yes. They do then some really good drinks. What did the crazy supervisor want? Hey, Assad. So what? - Hello my friend. Hi, Nour. - Hi. - I can't find apples. - I can find some in the warehouse. (Sob) - What's wrong? - I just have a stomach ache. - I'll get your father. - You do not have to. No, that's fine. You should not work then when you have it there. Nour. - What's wrong? - My father killed me. There is no one, killing you. What happened? Are you pregnant? Yes. I've got it removed. It will be OK. Nour! Nour, what happens? What happens? She's not so good. I think it's food poisoning. You should not work then if you are sick. Are you okay, Nour? - Peace be with you. - And peace be with you. What's the matter with you? I'm fine. I go home and lie down. Gitte Charles. It's an old lady, for hell. - The whole of Europe is looking for her. - She can travel under another name. A doctor from Sprogø, Curt Wad, connect them all four. Gitte Charles worked for him. Nete ​​and Rita were his patients. - Philip was his lawyer. - Was Curt Wad a doctor at Sprogø? - Do you know him? - He has the research center Danevang. He and his wife have the land best fertility clinic out there. Is there anything, we should be here? Curt treated Rie after everyone else Doctors said we could not have children. Wasn't it for him, We hadn't had Jonas. He is a generous man. Treat him properly. Carl? I want good You treat him properly. Yes. I can almost figure out It's about poor Philip. Everyone thought he was alive in the arms of a Spanish beauty - - on the sun coast, and then he's really dead. Together with Nete Hermansen and Rita Nielsen. - In Gitte Charles's apartment. - Give Charles? - What is the connection between them? - The girls? They were, as I remember it, close during their stay at Sprogø. You mean, it's Gitte Charles, who did it? You do not happen to happen, where she is? I haven't seen Gitte Charles for 30 years. Why did she want to killing the three? It's a grotesque story. I know absolutely nothing. I am sorry about that. I'm sorry, if you have gone in vain. - Are they dead, those? - You have a good eye. It is a violent picture to have at a fertility clinic. Well, what to do? We doctors have a reputation for to have a little morbid humor. I always dreamed of a picture with the dead sitting on the dinner table. Strange, don't you? Are you sitting and giving yourself a motive? Was that all? - Curt? We're ready in here. - Beate. Yes, it's my wife. Are we done? Nørvig was your defender when you stayed accused of forced sterilization. - It was the woman's claim. - So she lied. It's possible she spoke true. The we did in extreme cases. That gave the law us the legal basis. We did things I am not proud of - - and did some abortions on moral weakness. It was another time. We did nothing illegal. Extreme cases? Who was she? What had she done? It is many years ago, so I can't actually remember it. You can remember that the three girls, two patients and one employee were dense. But not the sterilized woman, Who tried to pull you in court? Now she lost the case, didn't she? In that light, I think we should put the unpleasant tone of the shelf. I don't think a shit on him. Do you believe in him when he says, he regrets the abortions of the past? Does he have to regret it? I have then myself been the father of an abortion. What? You never told me that. - It fell like not naturally. - Was it with Vigga? - Why didn't you want it? - She had one already. Does it make me a killer? - All children deserve to live. - Nobody deserves me as a father. You never think about what it could do be made if you got the baby? I think it thinks: "Thank you for letting go." Carl, it's just about ... If I were you, I would hide it there. - You can see it on you. - See what? That you are with roe. Look to get away, as soon as you can. What happens to your baby if Wad and Miss Charles finds out? I can do that Don't get away. - Get rid of the fishermen. - I do not have any money. I know a fisherman, who wants something other than money. I dont do that. I'm pregnant with Tage's children. You can do something else than to spread legs, Nete. Can't you tighten it a little? Shh. Open the door. - Now? - Slowly. - Hello Hans. - Hi, Rita. Your friend says, that you will run away. - I got no money. - No, I hear that. But you want to Have fun, right? Do you want to go to Korsør or not? - Just tell me what to do. - You can take your jacket off. - Remove the panties and come over here. - What? Remove the panties. - Come over here and lay down. - Write ... Come. - Draw, Write, Write! - Shh. Stop it, it's not the first time. Spread the legs now. Spread your legs! - I am pregnant. - That's what I'm saying, right? It's not the first time. Spread the legs now. No! No! Let go of me! Spread the bones now! Let go of me! Thanks. I think we've seen enough. She must be in the report room. - Neat. - Let go of me! Why, Rita? Why?! Why?! - Be quiet. - Drop me, your so! You did the right thing. Tomorrow do I write to your parents, - that you have shown maturity and ready to go home. It's a waste of time, this. - Hi. - Was there any new information for us? - Where's Rose Knudsen? - She's at the police station. I'll see some signs. Come on, damn it. It's not a case that I has bijob as supervisor at Sprogø. My aunt was sterilized on the island. She ended up committing suicide, because she could not have children. I have complained to the Danish state. It must recognize its responsibility. On November 3, 2003, I sent the first letter, then 9/5 2005, - - 4/8 2006, 6/4 2007. Yes please. The doctor who sterilized your aunt ... It was Curt Wad? It is correct. And here one thought, that the police were a bunch of amateurs. Don't cheat on Curts new empire. He is still a good social democrat, who is fighting for the right society. I don't know what that means In this context. Curt still does what the state put him started 60 years ago. You need to be clearer. Curt sterilizes young women, without them knowing. Healthy, Nordic girls must have children. Weak girls, he thinks want to give birth to stupid children, must not. Immigrant girls are his focus now, And he is not alone. I suspect a number of people for that to participate in a larger conspiracy. Most doctors, but also lawyers, police officers and politicians. This is all the way up. If the murder case you're working on have led you to Sprogø, - - I think they are killed to cover what's going on. - Do you have evidence of that theory? - No. In no way. So why are we sitting here? Young women entering the clinic without the parents' knowledge. You can then get abortion without parental consent. Only through the Abortion Council. wads clinic makes it anonymous and free. A grassroots movement, for hell. The girls don't dare talk. Their parents Don't even know they have been there. What should we do? Many of the doctors had same defense lawyer. You know who. - Philip Nørvig. - Yes. His records will probably show a pattern, a system. But to get them out of the company, he worked at, - I need a court order, and such a one I cannot obtain. We can't do that either. Not as long as we don't have evidence. And Rose has your number, if we gotta get you? What happens? I know one of the girls on the video. She lives in my street. Hi, Nour. I'm louise. I have to do the investigation. I'm fine. We want to secure ourselves no mistake has been made. - I'll be home before half past four. - Okay. It is no problem. It goes fast. Assad, if you're just waiting out front. Like that. It may be a little cold at first. Is it okay? Well. What are you looking for? I'm just looking for if everything is as it should be. That was exactly what you said. Assad, shall I tell her? I'll take it. Nour, maybe you should Sit down. - We need your parents out here. - No. Have you talked to them? Not yet. - Who did your abortion? - Why? - I need to know. - Why do you need it? What was the doctor's name? I tell you nothing before you promise not to call my parents. I do not say anything. I need to know. Assad. Promise me, that you do not call them. Then I promise. What was the doctor's name? Are you completely sure? It is very important. Yes. Curt Wad, Danevang. Assad, why? Why do you need to know? He has done that ... He has done this, that you can't have children. A sterilization. - Then you have to do it again! - I can not. What the hell is this for something? You pull me all the way here to say I can't have children? We must stop those who have done this to you. I promise. Doctor Wad and all of them, he works with. - You must tell ... - I have to go home now. Tell the police what happened. You know, that I can't tell anyone. I don't think a shit on you! We must stop them, who did it. Yes. We need to get hold of Patient Complaints Board. Carl wants a list of Mistakes in abortions since 1970. 1970? There are paper journals. Get the list of doctors, as a Brandt talked about. - I know what is. - Hey, what's going on? Thank you for coming at short notice. We always knew that there was a risk. Now there are gaps And we'll probably have to deal with that. If everyone in here meet any question - - with a wall of silence. We go to sleep with immediate effect. Just to return stronger than ever before. (mobile calling) Hello? Is that you, Brandt? - You got my list of doctors? - I got it. Are you okay? - I think they have discovered me. I never follows the same way twice. When I suddenly look the same three times, there are problems. - This doesn't feel good. - I'm coming out to you. Can you be here at a precise time? - I'm driving now. - But when can you be here exactly? I'm coming right away. All doctors on Brandt's list had Nørvig as a lawyer. - They have collected patient complaints. - The stupid pigs! - We must get hold of Nørvig's widow again. - Don't smoke in the car! Take it easy. We'll probably stop them. Is that what happened to Nour, connected to the murders? - We still lack a motive. - What if Brandt was right? Gitte killed them because they found out of what Curt was doing. If you want to get rid of witnesses, put them not about a table with ID on your pocket. who they were. What do you think? - Carl? - Nothing. - Two days left. - It's so nice. I look forward to. I look forward to. (Cutting torch) (Klonk) - What are you doing here? - Hi. We just have some follow-up questions if you have time. Otherwise, I think you got really good around it lately. - I want to get to the bottom of this case. - Has anything new happened? Philips specialty was to defend doctors - - in cases about malfunction of women. Now I ask straight away. Was Philip in a group or a network of people, - - who didn't have much left over For some like Assad here? I have never shared those positions. I am a decent person. He didn't talk about it at home. He was not allowed to do that. We think Philips death has connection to that group. Saw everything you can remember. Names of members. Sager. Doctors. Patients. He never talked about the group. We did not discuss his work. Are you completely sure? I wanted to be able to help you. He kept that part of his life hidden from me. Why don't you look in his records? I have them in the basement. - He worked mostly at home. - So you got it all here? - Yes. - In the House? (music: "When a sailor goes ashore") Hello? Hello? Brandt? Fuck. Holy shit. - What do we have? Error sterilizations. - Curt Wad. - Births that go wrong. - They haven't hidden well. Nobody knew, what to look for. Before now. - What is that? - Journal 64. Nete ​​Hermansen's Language Journal. Is there anything exciting? Carl? Who are you writing for? - After him! - I can't see a shit! Beware! - Are you okay? - I can't get out! Click free. They come back. You need to get out of the car. They are coming! - Give me your gun! - Here! I'll get you out! I'll get you out! Come on, damn it! Drop it there! Run for hell, Carl! Race! Next stop Puttgarden. - Rita says you're pregnant. - She is lying. We'll probably have to decide. It is only reasonable You get a penalty now, Nete. - You do not! You do not! - Shh. We do not learn anything without punishment. My ear! Ouch! I bite the other too! Let go of me! So now we are sending a loving greeting to K.K. Steincke. He was behind the great social reform in 1933. We have a lot to thank Steincke for. Steincke said something wise. We must not get too many sub-meters. It is a practical measure, for the welfare society to work. Well. We're getting ready for scraping and sterilization. Thank you, Gitte. Wanted people on motorcycle. A person is hit by shots in the left arm. Supposed to be armed. Rose? Rose, for hell, you are so cool. - How are you feeling? - It's been a shit. The offender was after Brandt's computer. Technically, it now has. Curt Wad have an alibi for the whole evening. Haven't you told me, Rose? We think there is a group. A group of doctors who do Mistakes, kills fetuses. Sterilizes women. Genetic cleansing. It is too insane. We would have heard of that. There are 2,000 complaints against the police annual. We win them all. Because we never make mistakes, or because we protect each other? We were assaulted. They burned the car off with all our evidence. Then they killed Brandt. Because he's talked to us. This is bigger than Curt Wad and a couple of his doctors. What about the bodies in the apartment? Was Gitte Charles in the group? This is crazy. Why hell no one can find Charles? Now you hear two really good looking. I say it for your sake. Especially for your. You are heading up the ladder. The higher you come, the more political balancing act. No one here charges or threatens Curt Wad and his wife or anyone else - - before we have solemn and legal 100% bullet proof for, - - that a crime has happened. Nail so I can see You have understood it. - Carl. - I understand. - Thanks. - Yes. What do you have? There are bites on the name. She's on a bus. It arrives to Hovedbanen 08.25. Carl! - What happens? - Just drive. I'll come later. - Where are you going? - What the hell are you doing? There's something about Gitte Charles, You don't tell me. Don't you trust me more? Of all people? I don't bother your crap anymore! We work separately now. Okay. You mean in all the 24 hours, you have left? - Fuck you! - Don't take care of him. Before hell. ("The sun is raising in the East") We have a sad message. The then State has decided to close our home here at Sprogø. You're coming to manage you fine out there. Nete? It's Nete, right? Worldwide looking for Gitte Charles. You traveled home on your real passport. Nete ​​Hermansen. You were the only one who had anything on them all three. A motive. I read your journal from Sprogø. It was you, - - who filed a case against Curt Wad, but it was rejected. Curt Wad killed your baby. What do you say we two ... Help! He's trying to steal my bag! - What happens here? - Neat! Nete. (Honk) Nete! Nete! I'm from the police. Follow the taxi. Drive! Hello? Hey! - What have you done? - It is fine. I must... - What are you doing here? - They say I can't have children. I do not know what's happening. But we are also finished. See you on Wednesday. Come on in, so we can talk a little. There must be something, you have misunderstood. Come. Sit down. And tell me what happened. Who says you can't have children? I can't find her. Where is she? I do not know. Hey! I'll just talk to you. I'm looking for Nour. Do you know where she is? - I don't know where she is. - You know I know her. I know you were in the clinic. Has she gone there? I just want to know she's fine. Did she get into the clinic? - Yes. - Thanks. Bulmeurt tastes better than it smells. I don't want to be embalmed and inside if I scratch. You beat Philip Nørvig, Rita Nielsen and Gitte Charles killed. Then you got Gitte Charles to look like you. You gave her your ID, your necklace. And the empty chair was Curt Wads. Sorry, what are you doing here? The center is closed for today. - I'm looking for Nour. - Who? You know, who she is, your psychopath. I know what you did to her. Is she here? An emotionally unstable immigrant girl was here today and went home - - after a conversation with one of our doctors. Was that all? Hey. - Then you stop. - Now I want to ask you to go. - Was she there? - They say they sent her home. It doesn't fit. Her phone is in the area. - She's still here. - Beware. They are dangerous. Assad! What happened? Take and I were together for a while after Sprogø. But I was no longer the Nete he fell in love with. His dream was to get a family. I couldn't give him that. Curt had taken care of that. So I left him. I would not drag him down into the dark. All I had was hate. I wanted revenge. Revenge of the satans, who had ruined my life. Can you understand that? Yes. I start to feel it. You don't scratch off of the little mug there. - It is like smoking a joint. - Well ... well then. Only after the dismissed trial, I thought about killing them. - But you waited several decades. - For a long time it was just a dream. Something I fantasized about while I was hanging out. Alone in a tavern. Or lay dead in my bed. Then it dawned on me I had nothing to lose. - I might as well try. - Gitte Charles was the first one? It took six years to win her confidence. Getting her to believe that I had forgiven her. Then she sat there too and smiled at me. Laughed. Happy because now she should drink a little in the bulmeurt. Yes. - It's a weird feeling, isn't it? - Yes, it's just ... So she was going to die? I don't need more of this. Why should they sit thus? Around a table? It was a picture Curt had shown me who gave me the idea. A picture of a family, there were dead in their bed. Then I thought That is how they should be. Around a table. Died. And look at each other and their unworthy lives forever and ever. And the last chair for Curt? It would be difficult to lure Curt into the apartment. - his old nurse, Gitte Charles. Why not finish it? Curt deserved it more than anyone else. While I was doing to delete my life as a Nete, - I discovered, that Tage had written to me. He had become a sailor. He had raised the world thin. He had never had children either. - Then he stood in front of my door and invited me out. And danced. I had never danced before in my life. The next morning I woke up and lay looking at him. And then I knew that all those many years were wasted. But it wasn't too late. I did not have to hold on to my anger. I didn't have to to hold onto the revenge. So I let go. God is dead. The state fails. But love prevails. If you... If you are lucky. The last 12 years have been the happiest in my life. Nete ​​... We'll probably hit Curt. I promise. I haven't come for that to throw you in prison. No one knows I'm here. Tage's last wish was getting his ashes scattered in the Sound. (mobile calling) - Carl, where are you? - Nete Hermansen is dead. She's been dead for over 13 years! Assad is out on Danevang. He thinks they've taken Nour. You have to go out there. I haven't heard from him long. Do you hear what I'm saying? - Turn the ferry. We're going to Copenhagen. - Don't be here. Assad! Stop it there! What the hell are you doing here? Jacobsen has asked me to pick you up. They have accused you of police violence. Here is no one, for the hell! Here is closed. - Come on. - Fuck. (Rustling) - Assad! - I just need to check the door. Fuck! Nour! Gunnar! Her pulse is good. She's just stunned. Sit downd! Call for an ambulance and backup. Do you know the cold winter theory? No, you don't. It is also relatively new. It means that the longer the people in prehistoric times - - walked toward the cold, Nordic countries, - - The more cash they were chosen by nature. To the north only survived with high intelligence. They established the democracies, we cherish and must cherish. Democracy was founded in Greece. So all those flowing here these years, they ... You are simply too weak. But because of our robust society you are kept artificially alive. - What happens? - They are on their way. What happened here was that Nour got an abortion done by us. You couldn't live with, that an unbeliever performed abortion - - on a good Muslim girl. You came up here, went crazy, threatened me. In a fit of rage You tried to kill me. Fortunately, it responded your colleague quickly and saved you. But the ambulance did not arrive in time, - and therefore stayed a deadly shot fatal. After all, you tried to shoot me. Remove the girl. Get rid of her. Make it look like suicide. Make sure it goes so far away from the center as possible. Like at the other end of town. Hey! - I will get the car. - We'll be here in three minutes. Hey, funny! Hey, Carl! It is me. - What are you doing here? - Assad has lost control. - Where is he? - He's down here. Come. What happened? You bleed. The motorcycle. It was you I shot. So then. We help you A little on the way to a heart attack. You'll get it anyway within ten minutes of time. So then. You just feel a little dot. What the hell are you shooting in? Assad, look at me. Look at me. Come here. Don't stay away. Hey Hey. Stay here. I need patrols and ambulances for the Danevang Institute. Now! Come on. Assad, no, no, no. Look at me. Come here. Stay here. Carl is here. Blood pressure is stable. There are still cardiac fibrillation. Is there anything new? No. from killing chief Jacobsen just passed press conference. Everything points to a group of doctors for years with great patience - - has sterilized a group disadvantaged women. Louise? Primarily women with other ethnic background? The effort was primarily aimed at women of other ethnic origin. That's all. No more questions. After the dramatic swap at the research center Danevang, - - who left a servant's death and another in critical condition, - - is chief physician Curt Wad and two employees in custody. The other members of the group Cold Winter was not just doctors. The members stretch far into it in the state apparatus, "deep state". - Then one of the group's victims, Nour Turan, went out with his story. What happened to me, I can't change. But I can help, that it does not happen to others. That's why I'm talking to you now. More than 60 young women now have phoned or written to the police. The many inquiries have led to four arrests of doctors. According to the murder chief is full clarifying the case of the group, - - who calls himself Cold Winter, just started. Good morning. We had to put you in artificial coma, while you were recuperating. I'll get you a little drink. Pardon. Hey. Hey. Oh boy. - It was about to go wrong. - Yes. Well, but I'll be back tomorrow. I think you should come back to Section Q. And Rose needs you. Rose needs me? Yes, and I need you. (Sniffs) Come back. May I just be allowed to get out of my fucking coma? Of course. Assad, you're awake! Ouch! - Take care, Rose. - Oh yeah. Pardon. Sorry, Assad. - Hey, Rose. - Hi. How are you feeling? You're awake. Why didn't you say he was wake up? You might have said that. - He's just woken up. - You could have shouted it. - No. It shouldn't be there. - Why not? - Yes come. - Rock scissors Paper. Fuck. Rock scissors Paper. Rock scissors Paper. Yes! Hey. - Can I put myself here? - Of course.
