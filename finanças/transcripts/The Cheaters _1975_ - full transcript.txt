Carnations sir? Carnations? Buy a carnation for the lady? A carnation and it's yours, agreed? Okay. It looks almost real to me... Aren't you going to take the carnation? I've already taken one,thanks. - Good evening. - Hello. A Fernet Branca and two whiskies for table 5. What excitement! People always worked hard and went to bed early in Milan, especially now that they have less to spend. Milk and champagne. A strange mix May I ask who recommended it to you? That friend from Varese. Ah, I understand. There's a door in the toilet which conceals a lift. Go down one ﬂoor. You can go. The toilet's back there. Good evening. The man isn't made by the clothes. You mean: 'the clothes don't make the man'? Ah, yes. That. - Ma I go in? - This time. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you - Sophisticated stuff. - Which game do you prefer? Poker? I only have fun playing poker. Good. There are several tables, you'll definitely find one to your liking - This way, sir. - Thank you. Pass. 50,000. - 100,000. - 200,000. - I'll see you. - Titanic Me too. Yes, but I'm sorry for you: mine's with the 10 of hearts Bad night. That's enough for me for tonight so I'll retire, and maybe tomorrow there's taxes too. Good night. Good night. May I? Of course! We need a fourth player, but I must tell you that the stakes are unlimited. Chips are 10,000, but there are other tables. No. As they say: 'all good things come to an end' and 'win or bust'. Well said. Win or bust. 10,000 stake. Bloody hell! You opening or not? Vlfith all these qgeens all I can open is a ordello. What are you doing? You don't know how to play at all: this is four queens! With a hand like this you could win the shirts off our backs! Deal the cards again. But if you can't play, leave. Why are you here? To ruin our enjoyment? No, I know how to play. It's just that as soon as you arrive, bam, you get dealt a good hand. Well, it just seemed too damn lucky. I told you the stakes are unlimited here, not the vulgarity. Okay, I'm sorry. I won't do it again. I'm sure you won't do it again... four queens for god's sake! I haven't seen four of them together for a yea r, but you've just got here and like a mug you let them go. Hurry up. Okay. - Chip - 50 No, pass. No, I pass too. What makes me angry is when I deal the cards mine are always shitty. Keep your comments to yourself. I'll play. One card. - Stick. - Wow! Oh yes, no comments. I'm out, but I want to see... You have to pay if you're curious to see me, it's impossible for free. Okay, okay, so I won't see you. Chip. I'll see you. King-high straight. Mine's queen-high. You win. 50 stake. - 100 blind. - I'll cover that Blind? Excuse me, but why don't you find another table that's right for you? We play seriously here. Don't tell me you don't know that 'blind' means opening without seeing your cards. Of course, but I'm not stupid. 100 grand without seeing what I've got? Look, all different! I'd have made a great gain! - I'll pass. - I'll play. Sometimes it's better not to have good cards. You can win more, if you know how to bluff, of course. Could be but... I prefer to wait for four nice aces, that's when I like playing. Good evening, Mr President. Good evening. How's the evening going? Everything's fine. There's a man who I've never seen before sat at the big poker table who's clowning about. Raise the volume a bit. I'll open with 50. Not enough. 100.00.00 I'll see you. Me too. Alright, I'll play. Here's another 50. Three cards. Cards? I'll stick. One for me. And me. Over to you. So... Are you going to decide or not? My Tum? Come on, we want to play. Another 100. Pass. - 2 million. - No, I fold. 2 million, plus 10. Plus 10,000? No, plus 10 million. The custom here is to put the money on the table. 160's here. This is a cheque book, and here's a pile of change for when I have to call my mother. The moral is I just have to fill in a cheque for 11 million 839 thousand and... Unfortunately cheques are only accepted from people we know! Oh, what a shame! One should trust others more. Somebody would have to vouch for you, but I can't see who could. Well, if that's the way it is... Get them to tell him to accept. Call the manager for me. The President says to accept the cheque, he'll vouch for it. Here it is. So, yes or no? We want to play. I'll see you. Well, it's obviously a bluff. Good enough? No. Four kings. And is it enough with a fourth ace? You cheated! You said you'd get four aces before! Alright, so that's the way you do things here? That's what you say when a customer wins? Oh no, how silly! The gentleman was simply lucky, but this table is closed. I'm sorry gentlemen, the evening was becoming quite pleasant. There's 10 million cash to be paid. You can cash it at the desk I'll accompany you. The change is the tip for the staff. Good evening. 2 million, plus 3, plus 5. 2 million, plus 3, plus 5. 2 million, plus 3, plus 5. I thought it would be heavier. Not bad for four of a kind. - Good evening. - Good evening. Another ten bundles please. Let me tell you that poor man was right. The cheque was a dud, and in effect I cheated. And to be honest as well, this doesn't go up, it goes down another ﬂoor. Good evening. You could at least have said 'good evening' first. Bring him here. You're lucky. I wouldn't exactly say that right now. You're lucky because I rarely come here, and if I wasn't here you'd have ended up in some sewer. And now? And now you'll end up wherever you want to end up. What's your name? Where are you from? Luca Antieri Suburban gambling houses. Clean record. Professional cheat since the age of 10. I prefer ﬂexible French cards. As you've seen, there are people who think with their feet, and people who think with their hands, like you. I watched you:you're good. You're wasted on the small-time in my opinion. If you didn't lie to me and your record's clean, I'll get them to give you a table with chips at 10,000, just for starters. And then... if you concentrate on the game, you'll move to the 100,000 table, and 10% of the winnings will be yours. And when I lose? I'll pay. Meaning you won't lose. Right, I've already prepared your 10%. You see l trust you even before I've checked your identity. Try to live up to it. Might I know for who I'm working? Here everyone calls me the President, You should do the same. 24, black pays and pass. Congratulation sir, you win again. Hello! Street bet, and the last 7 to the gentleman. Thank you. Thank you gentlemen. Bets please. This is our Luca, who has shown great talent in just a few weeks here. I'm sure you'll enjoy yourself, Honourable Slr. Honourable sir, I'm particularly privileged. Lets forget the 'Honourables', we play with chips of a 100,000 here. You deal the cards. Here we are! End of the line, so get off, you beauties! This ugly pig can't stand the weight of your cheeks. Don't make fun. Now I'll show you my two rooms with bathroom, kitchen and a panoramic view. From up there you can also see all... Get up big mouth, that was just the ante. Luca, watch out! Help! Pair of face cards. No, you clown, three of a kind. Oh, I've only got a pair of queens. Three of a kind, yes. Three shits. Don't worry Luca, you'll soon see Don't worry Luca, you'll soon see he won't give you any more trouble. The president has thrown him out, forever. I'm not worried, but next time I don't want to find four gorillas outside my home. The matter's closed. You concentrate on the cards. Doesn't seem like a great evening but try to improve it. - Alright. - Good evening, Mr Luca. - Good evening. You're expected at the table. - Hello. - Good evening. - At last! - Good evening. Lets hope lady luck changes, it's been bad until now. 50,000 alright? Cut the pack. We three are slaughtering each other. It's crazy. Just think, four jacks against a ﬂush. And I had a king-high full house against four queens. Luca, it's your tum. No bid, I'll open with 100,000. Yes, I'm in. I'll see you as well. Well, are you in? How much? The opening stake's 100,000. Cards? I'll stick. - Two cards. - One card. Two cards for me. Here they are. 200,000. I'll see you. Pass. What about you, Luca? Er, I'll see the cards. Three sevens. Jack-high straight. Luca... Luca, it's your tum! I don't have anything. You're dealing. No, I'm sorry, I don't feel like it this evening. I owe you 300,000. Unti tomorrow. You can have any one, but not that one. Like the story of the apple? - Good evening gentlemen. - Good evening. You can eat all of them but not that one? You've read the bible, haven't you? Yes but here,they won't just throw you out of paradise, they'll send you to hell. She's the President's son's friend. He presides over many great things, but not over my private life. Damn it! You know the story of the white rabbit with the tuft of black hair? All the other rabbits made fun of him so he put his head on the tracks hoping a passing train would cut off the black tuft. - Tell me another time. - Wait! The train passes and zap! It cuts off his head. The moral? Never lose your head over a tuft of black hair. You've got tufts on the brain! Take me home, Lisander... I told you to take me home now! I heard you, but Mr Corrado told me to wait until he came out. It would be better if you waited too, miss. You know what Mr Corrado's like... Can I help you, miss? Stay away from me! What a temper! What are you doing? You dented my mudguard! I'll show you how I'll dent you! Over the top. Hey. wait! Wait a minute! What do you want? Come on. Go on. Go on, show me how strong you are! Hold the handlebars while I make a cuckold of your boss! Listen... Why you don't get on? I assure you there's nothing better than a ride on a bike to relax your nerves. I told you to stay away, didn't I? I am staying away now, but I'll come closer sooner or later. It's a question of temperament, isn't it? Please go or there will be trouble for both of us. Not if you follow me. Psst. Listen, there's another exit over here. My name's Luca, and you? Maria Luisa, but everyone calls me Meme. Then you'll be Maria Luisa just for me. Hold on tight. It's late. - Seven. - Piaget! You treat yourself well. I'm afraid I've got you in a lot of trouble. It doesn't matter. It was worth it. It's just that the trouble's greater than you realise. It was all greater and better than you probably expected. I've got to go now. I'll go with you. Better not. If I arrive on your bike it'll be hard to make him believe I spent the night at a girlfriend's Is he really that important to you? He allows me to live well, so I have to obey the rules. Is him treating you that way... part of the rules? Luca, he plays hard. Me too, but I don't want to create other problems for you. I'll come with you in a taxi and I promise I'll hide myself under the seat, so you've got nothing to be afraid of. I'm afraid you'll have to lend me something of yours to wear. Bye. You didn't tell me if we'd see each other again. No, Luca, it's not the right time. Okay, so bye, and take care. Thanks. It was lovely. Disgustingly lovely. I'll get your clothes back to you. Oh good, the clothes... What are you doing here? How did you get in? How dare you come here? Get out now. Get out. I said get out! Out! You took plenty of time. Did you give him your fur to get him to fuck you? And if I did? You know it's not good to profit from other people's property. That small animal's fur... was mine. Like that vase is mine, like everything in here's mine, like your body's mine. A man can dispose of his own things, the things he's bought. Strip her. Strip her. Come on. Leave me alone. No! No, leave me alone. No! No, leave me alone, dirty worm. She's all yours. Dirty pig, swine! Leave me alone! Worm, leave me alone! No Bastard. No, no, no... That's enough, Lisander. Go away now. Out! That's to show you I'm not jealous. But it annoys me when - without asking my permission - someone uses my car, my razor... or my toilet bowl. Hard, isn't it? That's the sixth one. I apologise, lets deal the cards again. Do you mind having five players? We just have to add the sixes. Make yourself comfortable. Chips. A couple of hands should be enough to see if you're as good as they say. I'm sorry to have to ﬂeece the boss's son. Mr Corrado is very good at cards. Oh, really? 50,000 bid,just to start off well. Pot. Pass. Three. Pass. Alright, three. No, I'll pass. Cards? I've got everything I need. I've always got what I need. I never have everything I need, but I make do. One million. I'll see you. I could say "four aces". Everyone's free to waste their breath if they want to. It's just that I don't just waste my breath I can also waste my money. Here, pay for another prostitute. - No, stop! - What are you doing!? Ladies and gentlemen, calm down please! It was a misunderstanding, nothing happened, return to your tables. Madam, please return to your table, nothing's happening. Please, ladies and gentlemen, calm down, calm down! Return to your tables. I told you both to stop! Stop! I said enough! Enough! - Who's in charge here? - Your father's in charge here, Mr Corrado, and he doesn't want such scenes. You only act tough when your back's covered. Come at me alone. Come on. And you're only good with a marked deck and risking other people's money. With people like you I can play without hands, whenever and however you want. Did you hear the braggart? So I'll see you tomorrow evening, here, me and you, and no tricks. It's the first time there's been a brawl in one of my gambling houses, and whose fault was it? - My son's! - I had to react, he provoked me. Save your breath. - Luca's already ghiven me his version. - You spoke to that worthless cheat - before speaking to me? - Yes! Because I'm worried about you, not him... How long have I been stuck in this bloody chair? Since you were just a child, remember? Even stuck here, even without legs, I've carried the business forward. But not with this, with this. The rare times I've had to use violence were just in self-defence. If someone punches you on the nose, son, try to hit them back if you can. That's correct, of course, but immediately, right away, because then... then you start to reason And reason says that this Luca is one of the best players we've ever had, a gold mine. That's why you've got to leave hlm alone. He humiliated me in front of everyone. Humiliation!... Pride... I'm telling you again to leave him alone, that's an order. On the other hand I'll soon send him to one of our gambling houses in Zurich, that way you won't have him under your feet. Send him where you like, I don't care, but I'll be waiting for him at that table tonight. If you fight on his turf, you'll never get your revenge. Can I go, father? Hello? Maria Luisa? Is that you? Hello? Maria Luisa? Hello? Hello? Hello? I told you it was useless. Forget her. I don't want to forget her precisely because I've got to forget her. A big risk. You're headstrong, Luca! It's so strong I've got no fear of putting it on the rails. Anyway when the train in your story arrives I'll lift my head in time, you'll see. I'm your friend, Luca... your train arrives this evening. Yes, I know. But I'll get Maria Luisa away from that worm, Understand? Want me to prepare a marked deck? No tricks this evening. You've just got to stop him cheating, - Okay? Bye. - Bye. Quick! He's ready. Have you finished making cards dance and breaking people's balls? I just break the faces of dick-heads like you. Let me see how! He's finished. Alright, get him up. Bring him round. Now they'll just be useful for begging. I'll take care of eliminating him. I'll throw him in the Olona with a pair of cement boots. Oh, no. He's got a date with me this evening. Throw him outside. Hide the goods in the dummies and send them to the usual address. The President likes to be obeyed. He's a coward, - he'll disappear. - Better that way. To him. To him. Well, gentlemen... I think it's pointless waiting... Don't be in such a rush. Sit down! Luca! Luca... what happened to you? Don't worry... I'm ready. Just one hand. Unlimited stakes. Just one hand. Unlimited stakes. You deal. Get lost. Alright. Come on, big man. Pick yours up. I told you before I'd play without hands. 20 million to play. I'll see you. And how will you pay? I'm sure I'll win. And if you lose? What do you want me to put up? That slag Meme. If I win you'll put her out of your mind. Well, you've already lost. Cards!? No. One. Over to you. 50 million to see me. Want to or not? Don't touch the cards! You've just got to say "yes or no". I'll see you, braggart, I'll see you! A pair of tens. Stop! I'll show them. Two jacks. I've won. Shame you don't know how to deal with women: if you hadn't thrown away a queen you'd have won. Bloody bastard! - I'll get that whore off your mind! - Mr Corrado! You want to keep him company? Take his trousers off. Stop! You've never known how to win or lose, but this time you've lost forever. And you have lost... everything! Take care of him. 70 million... can you pay it? How; If you hold your money tight as if you were taking it to the next world... I'll manage my money how I want! But now I've got to choose: eliminate him or eliminate you? You've always despised me, father. The choice isn't difficult. Indeed, it would be definitely be the best solution. I can do it on my own. The President told us to take care of you, so let us do so. The train's coming! What did you tell him? Me? Nothing! I said the train's coming. Without thinking. I gave you an order and you didn't obey. It seems you feel ready to take my place. You think you can continue to run what I built over 40 years when you're lead by your stupid thirst for violence? When you're at the top the brain must be in charge... just the brain! And my brain tells me I should have you killed now. All this for kicking a son of a bitch a couple of times? It's tragic that you don't understand. You wanted to stop him coming here and challenging you, but you didn't manage it. He's a man! The rarest thing today and you didn't realise it. And now I have to eliminate him like you do when the best horse in the stable is lame. He already knows too much about us, and if he went against us he'd be too dangerous. You're afraid he'll spill the beans to the police? You can buy a policeman, but you can't buy the competition which has become harder and more ruthless. I can't risk one of my best people crossing over to the others. That's why I have to have him killed, even though it's unfair and to my cost. - He's escaped! - Yes, they let him escape. He looked like he couldn't stand up, then he suddenly got away. Find him! Tum Milan upside down! You absolutely have to find him using any means. Go! I see the perfect machine's misfiring. This is the last nonsense that I'll excuse. From now on, the fact that you're my son will be just an aggravation. Don't worry, father. The next time I do something... you won't be able to complain. Might I know what you still want from me? He's not here, unless he's slipped down the pan. Seeing as you're in my home after all, - I'd like to know what's going on! - But of course, miss. We're hunting for your little friend, and if he comes here take my advice: don't try to hide him. Luca! Luca. The young gentleman's reduced me to this state. Luckily you left the car open. - I'll take you home. I'll call a doctor. - No, better not. It would be dangerous. If they catch me it's over. You've got to take me to a doctor friend who lives outside town. Can you help me? Yes. Lets go. Horrible fractures. Splintered and exposed. You definitely mustn't move them. The plaster maintains position as best it can. However the tendons don't seem to be gravely injured. Maybe there won't be a 100% recovery but... Someone's already told me they'll be useful for begging. The bones adjust in one way or another. It's done. But you were lucky to not die from peritonitis with those bruises I found on the stomach, believe me. Luca, why don't you put an end to this lifestyle? Now that this nice girl is ready to stay by your side... You were my father's friend so you know that our clan was born on green baize. You never change Luca. In any case you're safe here. The farmer's my friend and he'll visit you every day. If you need me in any way, send someone to call me. The worst is over, now you've just got to have patience. Patience. I'll try to be patient until I've finished the game with that pig. No, Luca. I've already learned there's nothing you can do against those people. I've got to go now. Thanks for everything. I know the way, thanks. Good bye. Come here. If you want me to caress you, Frankenstein's ready. I'll come and visit as soon as I can. I have to be careful not to wake their suspicions and then... then, we'll see. I'll go and buy you something to eat. - Alright? - Alright! Maria Luisa why do you want to carry on sharing my troubles? Because they let me share something with someone, and your troubles are now mine. In an hour. May I come in? To what do I owe this honour? A bad start, but it doesn't matter. I'm not here on an official visit, but because I'm an unfortunate father: I got junk in the chromosome lottery. I got just one ticket and I lost. All the worst... for everyone. Where's Luca? - I don't know. - Listen, girl. If I'd wanted to force you to talk, I'd have had you brought to me. There must be a reason why I came here, don't you think? Luca couldn't have gone far being messed up like that unless someone helped him. You helped him, and you did the right thing. No, I... Let me tell you I'd decided to kill him. He obviously can't work for me and I don't want him working for anyone else. But maybe... maybe there's another solution. Open it. It's equivalent to 70 million. I'm paying a family debt. On the other hand a good killer doesn't cost much less these days, so I'm not losing money. Instead of paying someone to murder Luca I prefer to give it to you two. Take the money, take Luca and leave Milan, leave Italy and go away, away, away, away You've got to disappear, alright? And you've got to change professions my girl, and so has Luca. Besides, there's enough here for two intelligent people to start up anything they want. He must never handle cards again; if he does he's finished, and you with him. But Corrado might... My word's worth something while I'm alive, and I'll try to live at least until my son... becomes a man. Let's go. Where have you been? To pay. To pay because I have an idiot son. What do you intend to do? A coup d'Etat, father. Looking for this? You think this is the beginning, but it's the end, Corrado. It's your end, father. I'll remove the throne from under your behind. It's almost too easy: yours is a wheel-throne. So get on with it. Come on, get on with it, you big imbecile. Do it if you dare, you've destroyed my will to live. Come on, get on with it! Cowardly imbecile! Stop where you are! It was obviously an unpleasant accident. I think there'll be a lot of accidents these days. You were his bodyguards and this is the last time you'll see him. From now on I'm in charge here. Come on. Take me to him. Put the gun down and let the girl go if you don't want me to blow away what little brains you've got in your skull. Don't try it. I told you to throw the gun away. Now lay stomach-down on the bed... You've got tummy-ache. Goon Now you can tum over, As you see I was unarmed, but it didn't take much to trick you. You know what they call this hand? "A bluff against a mug". Now get up and call the other one. Tell him you killed me, go on. Come on. Goon, walk Quickly. Put your hands down. Call him. Come up, I fixed him! Come on, come up here. He's coming up? Come on, be good: go bye-byes. Like before, stomach-down. You should have paid more attention. I didn't know they'd followed me. The old man came to me and said we had to disappear. He gave us a nice pile of money to help us. It's down in the car. Come on my lovely, hands up and get rid of the gun. I told you to get rid of the gun. Get up, you animal. Go to bed too, stomach-down, to keep him company. Come on, faster. And now play in the dark. Seeing as you've got to put up with me for a while, what would you say to the Cote d'Azur? We'll be in Switzerland soon, and with an hour's ﬂight we're in Nice. He managed to disarm us and lock us inside that bloody place. You're an idiot as usual, you let him trick you like the biggest imbecile. I'm warning you my patience has a limit. Get out. Out! So, what's the problem? I was saying that the Hamburg group won't accept the substitution. They won't accept it? And who said they could decide or not? Who are they in Hamburg? Careful, well-organised people. Devoted to your father, but not to you. They have to accept me as well. If you'll permit me, I advise you to study the problem a little more deeply before making a hurried decision. On the other hand there are difficulties in Zurich too. There's a cargo of dangerous goods blocked in Trieste. Well, make them release them. You see, only your father knew how to... That's enough! "My father, my father"! My father's dead and I'm now in his place, clear? What's up? I've hurt myself. - It's nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? Look. No, Luca, it's too early. No I can move them. When the doctor visited me yesterday he advised "Movement young man, Movement! Movement!" Okay, but you've gotta promise me you'll never go back to playing. That man didn't even let his father stop him, and he'll go on looking for us. I want you to stay away from that world, otherwise you'll risk... Maybe I can't cheat at poker anymore, but they're fine for defending myself, and for holding you. - Thanks, Luca. - Thanks for what? Thanks for giving me the strength to start again from scratch. Nobody move, and hands up! Police! It's useless to trying to escape, the exits are blocked. Stop those people back there. I said stop! Arrest him, he's the one who manages the business. All those who came here to play can get out by leaving their names and addresses. You lot over there as well...quickly. That was the first warning. If you don't want to accept the deal I'm ready to make a clean sweep of your organisation within two hours, and with all the force of the law. Listen copper. You think you can intimidate me but I I can have you sent to catch sheep-thieves in Calabria within two hours. Your guardian angels ﬂew up to heaven with your father. Yes he... he could have... but he died in an unfortunate accident, and you have neither his prestige nor intelligence. A 5 million pay-off a month I told you, take it or leave it. Take it or leave it. It's already starting to be noticeable, isn't it? Yes I can't stand doing nothing any more. Are you nervous about him? I'm ready to keep him all for myself. Why are you afraid of becoming a father? It wasn't the right time to enlarge the family, but as he's here, never mind. Luca, how can you not be happy he's on his way? He'll give us the energy to improve ourselves. I'm convinced he'll bring us luck too. Don't go on. You know I'm not the type to be a model father. I just said it wasn't the tlme to build a family. Why haven't you got the courage to face life like everyone else? You don't need anything but the desire. Listen, Luca, you'll find a job, a job that's right for you, something clean, you'll see. You know these aren't for family hand-outs. Quick! Call an ambulance! - The went that way! - Do something! You've been playing and you lost again, right? Yes, I played and I lost, so?! Eh?! So?! We're broke, alright? I'm a scoundrel, a failure, is that what you want to say?! What did the old man tell you? That with that money two intelligent people could start anything, which means we're not intelligent enough! We'd started to be truly happy together, which is the most important thing Luca. I don't care about money, I'm just scared they'll find you again. My love, my darling, forgive me, but I can't do anything else. Help me, help me. - Yes! - Be with me always -and I promise I'll manage to change. - Yes... Now that you've completely recovered you'll see we'll be able to build something together... Yes. ...which we won't be ashamed of with our son. You've just got to promise me you'll never touch the cards ever again, and the rest will take care of itself. Besides I also got everything wrong at the start, but with you I realised that money's no use if you feel dirty inside. Happiness is something else. I love you. Luca! No hard feelings. Lets put a close to that time in Milan. I want to speak to you. - Alright. - Lets go. His name's Logan, a Texan, rich as a king. He's got gambling in his blood. Just think, he started by buying a horse and now he's got a stable which wins real bread at race courses all over the world. During the European season he weighs his yacht's anchor in Monte Carlo's marina and has fun playing stud in his yacht's lounge. A hotel doorman finds him opponents, all people ripe for skinning because this Logan doesn't know how to lose. You'll have to teach him. To sit at that table passing as chicken: you've got to tip the doorman 20 million, but in the end Kou could get up from t attable with half a million dollars in your pocket, and then I'll be there as your side-kick. And who'll pay the expenses? Thanks to these hands I've had no money for a while. Don't worry, I've had a lucky season. You've just got to think about getting those hands back as they once were. Idiot. To risk compromising such capital. And then we've just got to divide the winnings. 50-50, hmm? 50-50. My hands have been inactive all this time but I've worked my brain. I've studied a new trick. If I had the cards I used in the Milan gambling house, it'd be quite easy. Anyway, I'll let you know if I accept. Luca, it's not like the old times here. There's a storm brewing. The gambling den was discovered and closed by the police. They managed to keep the night club open, but things are going badly. Anyway, you've got to find out if his appearance in Nice and... and this weird story has Corrado behind it. I'll call you back in a week okay? Bye! Even in our field there are - how can I put it- professional ethics. Gentlemen, I don't understand. The elimination of that inspector was a show of force. You can call it what you like, for us the company's wound-up. You think you can scare me? Don't try it on with us, Corrado, and if you want some advice, don't try it on with anyone. The only you thing you have to save is your skin. Retire. Go to a country where they still use your methods. Yes, hello? Hurry UP. The stuff's got to disappear tonight. If the others catch us, that's it. Luca, Everything's going well here. Corrado's got other problems to think about, you've got nothing to be afraid of. Bye. You'll find $300,000 in an account in your name in Nice for the stakes and expenses. I'll arrive with Lisander the night before the game. Imagine his face when we make him spit out his share of the winnings in blood. That's how I'll settle the account with that bastard who caused all my problems. The ﬂexible cards that Luca likes so much. - What shall we do with him? - He's had all he deserves, but keep an eye on him until the story's over. How long have you been practising? It's not how you think. Yes, I'm going to play. But I swear it's the last time. It'll be the big one. To set us up forever. I'm doing it for him. - Don't you believe me? - Luca, you promised me. Yes I know, but I swear it's the last time. One eight, one jack, one seven, one ace, 30,000. I'll play. Okay. I pass. I pass as well. A king. An eight. Two kings face up against two aces. The two aces speak. - $50,000. - 100,000. Okay I'll see. 100,000. Three kings. Two aces, two eights. You win. If you don't mind I'll get new cards. We'll play with my cards this time. Please. Another deck, someone's already handled these. I'm pretty sure they won't come off until dawn. Go and call Mr Corrado and tell him there's no news. Alright. Two queens face up for you. Draw to an inside straight for me. - Your bid. - $300,000. I'm in. I want to see it through to the end. The pot's very interesting. A queen, which added to the other two means three queens. A king for me. It's still your turn to speak with the three queens. Passe-parole. Everything I have, $500,000. I...I'll see you Inside straight. I've just got two kings. You win. I won, I'm really sorry for you. I tried to bluff but I missed the train. I'm sorry, but I can't carry on. And you, my dear,thank friend Corrado. I'm sorry that the set-up didn't work for him either, and if I lost l did it on purpose for him. In any case,thanks for the stake and the evening. Good evening. See you soon. Your friend's very unusual. Quick, take me back. Not the port. Go to the nearest shore, then I'll swim. Quick Maria Luisa, we've got to go. That game was Corrado's trap. Quick! Luca,they're chasing us. Accelerate, accelerate! I can't, I'm afraid it'd be bad for you. I'm telling you to accelerate! - Hold on tight. - Yes! Accelerate, come on! Go on, shoot! Shoot, come on, shoot! Shoot! They're all dead, Maria Luisa. We did it. But you... - you're wounded. - It's nothing. Take me to the hospital and think about the baby, Luca, the baby. Stop! Stop! We did all we could, but the baby was premature and even in the incubator it couldn't survive. And she..'she's alive? Yes, she's alive, but... But? She's lost too much blood and the bullet irreparably damaged the spleen. - I want to see her. - Take him. Come with me. Forgive me. It's all my fault. The only thing you did wrong was to stop me on the street that night. Your only fault was to love me, to have given me the desire to live for something again. And the baby, have you seen him? Yes, I've seen him, he's beautiful, you know? Beautiful like you, with your eyes. - A boy? - A boy. What you wanted. I want to see him before I... Please Luca, let me see him. Of course you'll see him. It's impossible now because he's in an incubator. You've lost a lot of blood so you're very weak but you'll soon recover. You'll get out of here with him and we'll go away... whereveryou want, far from everything. Your bluff hasn't worked this time. Luca, the baby will only have you. No, you'll recover. You have to recover, Maria Luisa. The baby will have you as well. Tell him his mother loved him a lot even though she couldn't know him. Darling. My darling. Thank you. Thank you for having given me a son.
