Welcome to Seabrook. We're a perfectly planned community. [lawn motor] We all have perfect homes. Perfect clothes. The perfect life. Yep, everything is perfect. [children laughing] Until it wasn't. Who would have thought that an accident involving lime soda would set off the apocalypse? [explosion] And when the contaminated green haze blew west people were not happy. Because it turned them into... [growling] Zombies. [screaming] That's right. Zombies! [news anchor] There is bedlam in Seabrook, monsters are attacking! [screaming] Brain-eating... [growling] Zombies. Dark and gory times. But we built a big barrier to protect us from the zombie hordes. Safe at last, Seabrook could finally get back to our perfect lives. Well, a lot has changed since they built the barrier 50 years ago. Science found a much better way to deal with zombies. And you know what happened to those old brain-eating monsters? Well, they still have to live on their side of the barrier, but now they're awesome. I'm Zed. And yeah, I'm a zombie. Zombies have to wear government-issued coveralls. But we make 'em look pretty cool. And we have a curfew. And for a long time we were forced to stay in Zombietown. But we've come a long way since the outbreak thanks to the z-band. This puppy delivers a dose of soothing electromagnetic pulses that keep us from eating brains. Now zombies can live happy lives and have handsome, yet humble, kids. So things are changing. Today's the first day we can attend human high school, and I get to try out for the football team. Go Seabrook! Oh yeah! [grunting] Give me an "F", give me an "I", give me an "R-S-T". It's the first day of freshman year for me, me, me! [giggles] Oh, hi. I'm Addison and I have crushed cheer summer after cheer summer of cheer camp. But today's my shot at making the Seabrook cheer squad. You make cheer and you fit in. And why wouldn't I fit in? I'm a totally normal teen. Well, except for this. Born with it. Doctors can't explain it. They think it's some rare genetic thing. I can't dye it, nothing sticks. I've tried everything. In some places this hair might be odd in, like, a cool way, but not at Seabrook. People here hate anything that's different. If anyone outside my family found out I wore a wig, I would never be allowed to cheer. So I've worn a wig for as long as I can remember. [chatting] That's my little sister, Zoey. She really wants a dog but zombies aren't allowed to have pets. Some people still think we'll eat them. [barking] Come, Zed, come. [panting] [barking] Good boy. Hey, son, try this. Brains in a can. It's made out of cauliflower. And some for you, my little zombie angel. It tastes like gym sneakers, dad. I know. How great is that? Listen, Zed. I'm not so sure about this whole football thing, you know? It might be too much. I mean, you're a great kid, it's just... you haven't spent a whole lot of time around humans and humans don't really like zombies. That's just 'cause they haven't met me yet. [laughs] [woof] Cheer tryouts today! Cheer tryouts today! I am way fired up. Addison, you know that Seabrook's won every cheer championship since... forever. [whispers] Forever. But now the city council's having our zombies in our schools we need cheer more than ever. As mayor, I beseech you. You make that team and win that cheer championship. Beseech me? Really, mom? I get- that was um... Yeah, Missy, that was a bit much. A bit much, I failed at that. Nothing's gonna stop you, Addison. As long as you keep that wig on. Oh yes, of course. As long as you keep that wig on. Honey? It's on. It's time. Oh. Ready? (All): Go team! Woo! ♪ (All): Hi! ♪ Hi Zed. What's up?

They're just going to school like us. Like us? People love me, ok? I got jazz hands. Those freaks are nothing like us. They tried to eat our grandfather. It was just a small bite. Cheer tryouts today after school, everybody. Let's go, Mighty Shrimp! [squeals] Go, bottom feeders! Wait, you know, 'cause Shrimp. They eat the- the waste of the ocean at the bottom? No? Woo! Go Seabrook! Hi, I'm Bree and I've always dreamed of being on the cheer squad because I really want to be a flyer... tossed high in the sky. Nice to meet you. I'm Addison. I love cheer, too. Did you know the creator of the wave [together] went to Seabrook? Yes! That is so amazing! I can't wait to try out for the cheer squad! Ok, let's go. Come on, you guys, we're in a real school. No more classes in a dingy basement. [speaking zombie] You were saying? I'm Principal Lee. We are thrilled to be forced to have... [squeals] you here. Do not leave the basement. Have a great year. Principal Lee? Ok. I was just wondering... how do I try out for the football team? And the computer coding club? [speaking zombie] Right. Music class. Bonzo's an artist. He's classically trained. [plays tuba] [singing] ♪ Ahh, ahh, ahhhhhh ♪ Oh, yeah, ok, zip it. Let me ask you this. Do any of these include leaving the basement? Well... yeah. I guess. Then I guess you don't. So no tryouts for you. I'm sorry. I don't mean it. Have a great day. That's just an expression. Excuse me. Ok, let's do some grammar or something. This is supposed to be chemistry. Look, 45 minutes ago I was a janitor, kid, so bear with me. What am I doing? I'm on my way to football tryouts. Woah. Yeah, I know it's a high-risk move, but I got smarts and stealth on my side. [clank] [groans] Arg! Rogue zombie! [screams] Wait, what? [alarm sounding] Wait... [kids screaming] It's going to be fine, you don't have to... worry about it. There! Zombie! [kids screaming] Stay calm! Everything's ok! There's no fire! Fire? Bonzo, there's no fire! There's no fire! Look, we've come way too far to still be afraid of... fire. Fire! Bonzo! Ok, everybody, against the wall! Let's go! These drills are offensive and driven by zombie phobia. No talking. Against the wall! Fire! [screaming] Ok, I know this is scary, Bree, but there's a zombie safe room right there. It's gonna be ok. [screams] [automated voice] Zombie safe room secure. Hello? Hello? Hello? Why, hello. Don't get any ideas, buster. The only thing more deadly than my high kick is my low kick. I'm sorry. This just isn't how I was expecting my first day at a new school to go. You weren't expecting to be trapped in a zombie safe room? Oh, no, that I expected. That happens to me all the time. It's sorta my thing. [laughs] So I'm not gonna get low kicked? You're safe, for now. Good. [laughs] 'Cause today's a big day. I'm trying out for the football team. Well, we're both having big days. I'm trying out for the cheer squad. That's a tough gig to get. Yeah, but I love it. My parents have had me in cheer camp since forever. My dad doesn't even think I'm gonna make the team. What? No, sure you will. You just need someone to cheer for you. And soon, fingers crossed, it'll be, like, my job. So... I'm Zed. What's your name? Addison. Nice to meet you. [automated voice] All clear. [screams] Zombie! [slap] [groans] Wha- Zed, I'm so sorry. My parents have always taught me that zombies are disgusting dead-eyed freaks but... you're not hideous at all. Thanks. I'll take it. My parents have always hated zombies since one bit my grandpa's ear off. But now we'll just talk your ear off. There you are! Ew! Nasty! Zombie germs. If you ever touch my cousin again it won't be pretty. Which, as you can see, is off-brand for me. To the cheer tryouts. Seabrook awaits. [snap] Progress. We're making progress. Ok, welcome to football tryouts. As you know, this town is a cheerleading town 'cause this town likes to win. And our football team is awful, so we are not going to win this year, and I'm probably gonna lose my job. Good news for you, though. Y'all made the team, whoopie. Yes! I made it! Except for the zombie. What? Principal Lee said you guys shouldn't even leave the basement. She didn't tell you? No. Mmm-mmm. Don't think so. I think I would have remembered that. Come on, just let me be on the team. Can't have a zombie on the field, we'd look like a laughing stock. Besides, I'm no trailblazer. You know, I'm more of a follower. Actually, I'm not even really good at that, so... [bell ringing] Football is stupid, anyway. Wow, thanks for the pep talk. [speaking zombie] [laughing] Ha! Very funny. You know, I think that cheerleader likes me. The one that punched you? In the face? Yeah, yeah. I think there's something there, you know? Look. Humans are bad, but cheerleaders are monsters. Things need to change. [blows whistle] Ok, let's go! Line up. Welcome to cheerleading tryouts. It's nice to see so many... wannabes. I mean, we'd wanna be us too if we weren't already on the cheer squad. [laughing] You need to bring it, ok? Like my assistant captains. First up we have Stacey. [applause] Lacey. And Tracey. The Aceys. [cheering] Today's tryouts are going to be easy. The hardest thing you'll have to do is a back handspring, funky chicken, round-off match table split with a robot down powering finish. Afraid? Yes, Addison? Captain Bucky, was that funky chicken cajun or shake-n-bake? Well, I've never heard of cajun, so spice it up. We got this. The Mighty Shrimp don't think small.

Wear our colours with pride. Thank you! Thank you so much! Let's go girl! Let's go Addison! Hey, cuz. Bree over there has great moves and serious pep. Seabrook is all about precision. Perfection. She can't hide under a wig like some people. Pretty please? [sighs] Bree! You have some real... potential. You made the squad. As a stand-in. So I'm on the team? I'm in! I'm on the team. I made it! People love cheer. That's what makes me so important and I hate to see that change. Change is upon us now that zombies have entered our school. Cheer is being threatened. C-H-E-E- are you ready to protect it? Let the cheer initiation begin! Wow. Zombietown. Zoey! Dinner! Wow. Every year, for cheer initiation, we like to remind zombies that we don't accept freaks in this town. Egg that zombie house and you're both officially one of us. Oh. What? No. We can't do that. You look lost. [screams] Everything ok out here? Zed? Anybody there? Uh, no. Nobody. Come on back inside, then. Are zombies always this harassed? I had no idea life was like this for them. Come on. [announcement] Cheer season is here cheer followers. So let's rally our cheerleaders at the pep rally today. Hey! Hey! Hey, what's up, cuz? Zombies are students at Seabrook too, Bucky. Picking on them isn't right. Zombies distract people from what's really important. Like cheer, us... me. But we can't go around tormenting them. It's best if you don't question things. Pep rally today, cuz. You're gonna rock it. Yeah, Bonzo. In addition to getting rejected from football, I met a cheerleader and I thought she was cool, you know? I thought she was different. I thought she was the one. But I was wrong. Cheerleaders are all terrible. Hey, wha- there's no human students in the basement. Uh, someone yakked in the cafeteria. Oh, right. Still the janitor. Wow. This is... awful. Yeah, we would have cleaned but the teacher is territorial about his mop. Sorry. It's fine. Addison, what're you doing here? Apologizing. My cousin, he's a jerk about zombies and last night was cheer initiation. Not that that's a good excuse. I'm so sorry. Well, what if Bucky sees us talking? We'll make sure he doesn't. Uh, see you at the pep rally this afternoon? Zombies don't do pep rallies. We'll think about it. Ok, can we, like, crack a window open here? It stinks of human. [sniff] Of course Zed's not coming. I mean, zombies at a pep rally would be serious drama. There's zombies at the pep rally! They wouldn't dare. Stacey, Lacey, Tracey, bust out the spirit sticks. I can't believe you dragged us out here to see Cheery McCheerstein. I'm gonna be sick. Do I look green? Greener than usual? [music begins] ♪ [cheering] Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! Bucky! [cheering] Welcome to the Seabrook High cheer rally! [cheering] It is gonna be a great year. We are gonna win the state cheer championship again. [cheering] [cheering in zombie] Come on, Eliza, ease up. Cheer is contagious. So is pink eye. ♪ Go! Go! Go! Go Seabrook! Go Mighty Shrimp! Go Seabrook! [cheering] Go Mighty Shrimp! Go Seabrook! Go Mighty Shrimp! Go Seabrook! Go Mighty Shrimp! Go Seabrook! Get the spirit sticks! Go Seabrook! Go Mighty Shrimp! Go Seabrook! Go Mighty Shrimp! [cheering] Let's turn up the heat! Let everyone see them for who they really are. Monsters! Don't worry about it. A little fire's not gonna hurt us. Fire! It's gonna be fine! Don't worry. [groans] Bonzo, no! Stop! Bonzo! Addison! Wow! [cheering] Hey. Hey. You. Me. We gotta talk. He went through our offensive linemen like they were scrawny freshmen! Principal Lee, I can explain. Pa-ta-pa-ta. Coach wants you on his team. Really? Yeah. With a monster like- monster player like you we can turn the football team around. And with fan support maybe I can keep my job. Move out of my parent's basement. Get a cat. Get a gym membership. Turn it all around. It sounds so dreamy. I need you on the team, Zed. Um, ok. Can you just give me a second to think about it? Yeah, sure. Cool. We're cool? Pull it together. We're cool. Who's the zombie? I'm the zombie! And this zombie's playin' some ball! I can only agree if there are some changes. Full integration for all zombies. Oh, excuse me. There's only one little problem. You haven't won a game yet. That's a mere technicality. Could you throw my star player a bone? Not literally. Ok, look. In good faith I will allow zombies to eat in the cafeteria. And once you start racking in those wins then we'll talk about those other demands, alright? Yeah, deal. Deal. [laughing] I'll see you at practice. Yeah, see ya, coach. Deal. Principal Lee, get in here. Oh, gosh. You're the best. Am I? [announcement] Hello, students. This is Principal Lee. As you may have heard, zombie students are now allowed to eat in the cafeteria. [crowd mumbles] [announcement] Ugh! Just deal with it! The human cafeteria. Wow, Zed. You really delivered. Our very own lunch table in the darkest corner under cheap fluorescent lights and by the trash cans. I know. It's perfect. Living large and in charge. I just love the thought of flying through the air. Oh my- oxygen is so overrated. And so is dirt. Ugh, I hate doing the dishes, but it's like I love soap. Isn't it weird? Addy? Are you ok, Addy? My heart's racing and my palms are sweaty. Oh no, you have the flu. No, it's Zed. Wait, you like like him? You like like a zombie? Wow. That's bad, right? Really bad. My parents would so freak out. Are we still friends? Hello. I have your back no matter what. It's just, I don't want anybody to break your heart. Or devour it. But it- this is great. I mean, look. I swear on all that I hold dear, mostly glitter lip balm, I will tell nobody. It's cool. Well, nothing's going to happen. He probably doesn't even remember my name. Addison! Well, I can't be rude. No, Ad- no- Hi. Um, as they say in old zombie tongue, gazar nady garzane garsick. I looked it up on the internet. Um, you just thanked me for rubbing peanut butter on your umbrella. [laughing] Oh, um... I meant... welcome to the cafeteria. Thanks. Thank you. Ok, why is Perky Von Cheerstick here? The point of having our own table is to avoid people like her. Oh, no, I just wanted to thank Zed for rescuing me from the- excuse me. You know you're talking to zombies, right? I'm fighting against intolerance. Oh. I fought mine by eliminating dairy. Uh, zombie intolerance. Ok, look. You're cousin is not gonna be happy you're paling around with zombies. Cheerleaders don't support freaks. Oh right, Bucky said there was something different about you. I can see that now. No, I- I'm not different. Your smile. Is that an overbite? Is one leg longer than the other? Do you wear corrective lenses? No. No, no. I'm not different. I'm the samest person you've ever met. Hanging with zombies can be hazardous. You could end up at the reject table like- [snap] That. [French accent] Ah, ze perfect picnic spot. [laughs] Sorry I couldn't sit with you at lunch. I wanted to, it's just- everyone is- I get it. Some day, maybe. Thanks for saving me at the pep rally. Are you kidding? It worked out for everyone. Look at me. I'm gonna be on the football team and if things go well zombies will be more accepted. And we could, like, hang out in public. Wouldn't that be something? This town. This school. It's- it's hard not fitting in. How would you know? You're perfect. It's a wig. My real hair is freakish and I- I can't change it. Well, can I see it? Never. Sorry. My parents always made me cover my hair. And they're right. 'Cause now I'm on the squad and- and I fit in. Are you coming to the meeting? This is where we first met.

But there is an "I" in "zombie"- ok, that's not the point. Let's go, Seabrook! Hey, be my guest. The zombie's all yours. Set! Hut! [groans] Oh, that hurts. Ow. Oh, zombie down! Let's go! Five, six, seven, eight! [announcer] It's third and long for Seabrook. Really long. Yep, the Mighty Shrimp are doing what they do best. Losing. Come on, Zed. Ooooh!!! Aaah! At least the cheerleaders are amazing. Go Seabrook! Go Seabrook! Go Seabrook! We don't clap for cheerleaders. [whistle] [announcer] It's halftime and the Mighty Shrimp are getting barbecued, skewered, fried and flayed. Here's what you need to do, ok? I'm only gonna draw this once so pay attention. All you have to do. Move forward. Move all the way forward. Don't go back. There's nothing back here. This is empty. You don't need to go back here. You need to go up here. The end zone is up there. Just go- just move it up. Just move. Just do something. Look, I know we're gonna lose, alright? And you knew it, too. So let's just go out there and lose better? Go team. Doggone if you didn't get me dreaming of winning, huh? Oh, shame on me. What is happening out there? I- I don't know, coach. Maybe it's team chemistry, but honestly I'm not sure the team is actually blocking for me. Hey, Zed. I thought we had a deal. You didn't keep your end of it. Hmm? So win this game or it's back to the basement. Oh, hey coach, great idea. Now people hate us and we're losing. What happened to that brute strength I saw at the pep rally? Oh, my z-band was- Great! Use that! Take it and use it. No, I can't. Coach, no, I can't. Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm not letting you talk me into doing this. I just need a little zomboost, ok? Like what happened at the pep rally. Because that wasn't almost a total disaster? Yeah, no, I'm not doing it. Look, you- you already jail broke your z-band to play video games. This is different, ok? This is ludicrously dangerous. If I win this game, that's good for us. And that's good for zombies, and isn't that what we need? [typing] Woah. Way too zombie. Ugh, too human. Ok, just a little bit more. There. perfect. That's it? That's it. Alright, never swipe to the right, ok? That'll corrupt the software. Only left. Never right. Got it? Got it. Hey. If you smell smoke, stop, drop, and roll. [cheering] [whistle] Like coach said, we can do this. So let's do this! Let's go Mighty Shrimp! Break on five. Yeah, I don't think so. Ok. [roar] Ten!

You're Addison. [cheering] When I cheer it makes me happy. Me too. You're great at cheerleading, Zoey. Thanks, but my pet Zandor doesn't seem that impressed. Well, he should be. But I think you're old enough to have a real pet. Wouldn't that be awesome? Stop teasing her. You know they don't allow zombies to have pets. I didn't know that. I'm still learning that zombies aren't what I was taught. I mean, look at you. You're smart, cool, pretty. You think I'm pretty? Yeah. There you are. Zoey, woah, what're you doing here? Please. I'm not gonna miss a zombie mash. Zoey-- Come on. Who's a good boy? [woof] [panting] Me. Good boy. Good boy. Alright, I'll take you home. Zed's gotta make sure Addison gets outta here. We should hang out, Eliza. And I really like your boots. Oh, thanks. They're orthotic. I got this draggy foot thing going on, so... [laughs] She's cool. Yeah, for a human, right? She's just cool.

It's not safe for humans. Come on, let's get you home. You snuck out? Addison. Do you know how dangerous it is out there? I'm gonna go, chief. This town is full of monstrous zombies. What were you up to? I... I was out with a boy. Oh boy. Probably a good idea I just leave, chief. Hey. Now who exactly is this boy? Hmm? Well? Well? Goodnight, chief. Ah. You will not cheer and there will be no cheer championship until we meet this boy. Right. No cheer championships- Honey, I know- I'm not changing my mind. Ah. Right. We need to meet this boy, Addison, or you'll never cheer again. Right, Gus? Goodnight, chief. [announcement] Alright, Mighty Shrimps, today is the day, we've all been waiting for. It's the Homecoming game! Look, I'm all for trampling the system and the opposing team but you've really gotta stop messing with your z-band, ok? It's not safe. It's just one more game to get through. And then no more hacking your z-band? Yeah. Totally. Come here. Zed's cheating. He's been hacking his- Z-band. [snap] Addison. Last night, I wanted to help when the zombie patrol arrived but I was just- I was afraid- Zed, it's not your fault. The big problem is my parents won't let me cheer until they meet you. Great. So I'll just win them over with my quick wit and charming smile. No, not great. They don't know you're a zombie. And they hate zombies. Yeah. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. For making things difficult for you. No, no. You haven't done anything wrong besides being you. And you're great. You know what? If my family can't accept zombies, maybe I don't wanna be a cheerleader anymore. But you love cheer. It's what makes you, you. I wish I could just flip a switch and change everything. But I can't. I have to go, I'm late for class. Flip a switch. How is Zed winning these football games? Cheer spirits. Glory to all that is firecracker, firecracker, shish boom bah. Send me a sign so that my perfectly toned body can stop zombies from stealing our spotlight. We know how to stop Zed! He's been hacking his z-band. It's all about Eliza. She's using her computer to do it. Shish boom bah. A spa date. All of us. Hanging. We've been so wrong about zombies this whole time. Yeah. I mean, with some concealer, blush, contour, highlight and a little bit of hair dye, you could look cute. And I mean, when was the last time you pampered yourself? Yeah, giggling over make-up and doing each other's toenails? No sale. Uh, you like computers, right? My mom just set up a full VR room. VR? Ok, I mean, I don't wanna discriminate against humans so in a way it'd be wrong for me not to take you up on your offer. Um, yeah. I'm in. Ok, on second thought, maybe not. Maybe next time. Ugh. I can't access it. There's a firewall on Eliza's computer. We have to get in. We have to show everyone that Zed's a monster. Try harder! Not that hard. So Eliza told me not to swipe right, but no risk, no reward. This is gonna hurt. [screaming] Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!! [gasps] Something happened. Software is corrupted! We're in! I can't do this anymore. There's something you need to know. Ok. Now we're getting somewhere. Now we're getting somewhere. He's- [doorbell rings] Here. Woah, woah. You do not wanna open that. Where are your manners? Don't be ridiculous. Ok, fine. Open it. Yes, my date to the homecoming game is- Handsome. You look- Dashing. Uh, thank you. They're beautiful. So, how do you know my daughter? She's a cheerleader and I'm on the football team. Oh, really? Really. I used to play a little ball myself. He did. Really? Really. I was a full back. Get out. I'm a full back. No. Yeah. Let's do this. [together] Let's go Mighty Shrimp! Break! On five! That was amazing. That's what I'm talking about. We're gonna go to the homecoming game. Nice meeting you. Addison. He is such a nice boy. Such a nice boy. Where did you dig him up? I'll see you at the game. How did you- I adjusted my z-band. I can feel the energy coursing through my bones right now, it's awesome. Hey, we still got time before the game and I owe you a real date. A date? Yep. [squeals] Like I said, a proper date. Wow. [groans] Are you ok? Yeah. Yeah. I'm all good. Eliza was wrong. Nothing bad happened, I'm completely fine. After you. Thanks. Vanilla. Vanilla. Double vanilla. Can you guess what the last one is? Vanilla. Yeah, how'd you know? You guys got a wide variety. Of vanilla. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. This is so Seabrook. Hey, you know what? Vanilla works. [laughs] I've always wanted to come here. Now finally here I am, with you, on a date. This is so great. Hey? Is it, Zed? Yeah. Look at us. We're together. But you're forced to be someone you're not. Here, and on the football field. So? You wear a wig to fit in. Why can't I do the same thing with my z-band? Why is that so bad? Because it's not right. We're changing ourselves but what needs to change is everybody else. Addy, we're gonna make this work, ok? Everything's great. Trust me. I'll dial myself back to zombie mode and win the game. Take your pom poms out there today, Bree. But I'm not a starter. Who says? It's time things changed around here. [whistle] [announcer] Well, it's been a season to remember and it all comes down to the final seconds of this year's homecoming game. [whistle blows] Time out! Time out! [announcer] Unbelievable! Mighty Shrimp are down by five. They call their final time out. Bring it in, guys. Bring it in. Dare to dream, gentlemen. We can win this. I could keep my job. Buy slacks that aren't sweatpants. Maybe even win back my ex-wife. She likes the slacks. Ok? Let's do this! Ready? Yes please! (All): Let's go Mighty Shrimp! Break! On five! Woo! Yeah! Hustle out there! Remember the slacks! Wow, people really love Zed. It's almost like he's one of us. He is one of us. You're right. He is. Hey. You ok? Yeah. Yeah, uh, almost there. I do this and we win. Addison? Oh, I have to go. But I'll be cheering for you. Addison? [cheering] Give me a "zom"! (crowd) Zom! Addison. Give me a "bie"! (crowd) Bie! Mmm-mm-mm. You are way too good of a cheerleader to throw your life away, Addison. I'm cheering for a change, Bucky. Don't do it. Give me a "zom"! (crowd) Zom! Addison. Give me a "bie"! (crowd): Bie! I'm warning you. What does that spell? (crowd) Zombie! Last chance. What does that spell? You're off the team, you freak! Go zombies! Go team! [cheering] You're off the squad, too! [cheering] [typing] Stage one is done. [announcer] Fifty yards to go and three seconds on the clock. The Mighty Shrimp need one touchdown to win. It's not working. The software's been corrupted. How? [speaking zombie] Zed, what did you do? Ok, I can still do this. Even as regular old me I can do this. [cheering] Touchdown! Seabrook wins the game! I did it! Yes! Touchdown! Stage two. Stage two. Initiated. Initiated. Initiated. [snarling] [alarm sounding] Ok, excuse me. Excuse me. Stage three. Bonzo and Eliza. [alarm sounding] [snarling] [crowd screaming] My plan is working. I thought of everything. Great. So how do we stop the monster from eating our brains? [snarling] Didn't think of that. [crowd screaming] [snarling] [crowd screaming] Together we can take them. Yep, totally. [snarling] She's much tastier. [screams] [snarling] No! Zed! Zed, Zed, Zed. Take my hand. Everything will be ok. Just listen to me. No, no, no. Where are you taking him? No, please. Zed, please come back. No! Please. Addison, stay back. No! No! Hey! Hey! Threat neutralized, we're bringing them in. Gus! Hey! These are my friends. We don't have human friends. We told you, Addy. Zombies are not safe. Give them an inch- And they'll bite your face off. They'll bite your face off. Hey! That's my son you're talking about! I suggest you move along, Mr. Necrodopolous. I'll make sure they look after him. I'm sorry. Come on. Zed, please! Addy, I'm sorry. Maybe they're right. Maybe we shouldn't be together. What? No. Don't say that. Stop! [crowd booing] Hey! You did this to him. All of you. He was your monster! You made him feel like he had to risk his life to belong! Because you couldn't deal with someone different!

We spent some time in zombie containment. Not fun. But it's all my fault. I thought I was doing something right by doing something wrong. But now all zombies are getting software updates. No more tweaking them. Sweet. Eliza, they have wifi now. Too soon? Cheerleaders steal my computer, sabotage everything, yet zombies get the blame. It was stupid of us to think humans were gonna change. You know what? We tried doing it the nice way, now it's time to do it my way, alright? We'll have a zombie uprising. Force them to make us equal or we tear it all down. I've been waiting my whole life, alright? I'm sick of waiting. Your father and I have been so worried. What were you thinking? Hey? You could have died adjusting your z-band, Zed. You don't have to change who you are, son. I love who you are. Yeah, but they don't. Let's get inside. With the cheer championship a few hours away, Bucky is purging anyone who isn't anti-zombie. And that's a lot of people. What is this? Huh? Zombie flare? You're cut! Oh. Look at this. More zombie apparel. You're cut! Thank you! This isn't good. Bucky, what're you doing? Don't doubt me. We are cheerleaders. We are flawless. And that is why we will be perfect at the cheer championship tonight. So we are going to start at the beginning and go over it. Over and over. Get into position! I can't believe they're sending us back to zombie-only school. They say it's temporary but Eliza didn't even show up to school to clean out her locker. You got all of her stuff, right? [speaking zombie] Eliza's gonna sabotage something? Ya. What? [speaking zombie] The cheer championship. Ya. Well, come on. We gotta stop her, dude! [announcer] It's been a tremendous day here at the Regional Cheer Championships. ♪ And we've already seen a number of high-flying performances. You could say they've been cheer-tastic. Well, you can say that. I wouldn't. It's a- it's a made up word, so... [cheering] We're up next. How is this gonna work? We're not even half a team. We'll be great. I can feel it in my gut. It feels like a pit in my stomach. Well, that is not good, Bucky. We're gonna crush this. [snap] [cheering] I've always dreamed of cheering here. Just soaring in the air as the crowd roared. Flying higher than anyone's ever flown. That was a stupid dream. No. You will fly. Some day. As soon as this town gets over itself. I thought your parents didn't want you out in public with your real hair. They don't. But they can't make me hide it anymore. I'm not leaving this seat. No way. My dad's whole patrol couldn't get me out of this seat. I don't know, Bonzo. She has to be here somewhere. There! It's Zed! Hmm? Um, I'm gonna leave my seat. Go! Ok! Go! Hey! No, no, no, no, no. Put that away! Stop. Stop. Everybody stop. Ow! Get off of me, you big lug! Eliza, you can't do this. What? Enjoy the cheer championship with some fellow zombies? [speaking zombie] Sabotage? Wow. I'm deeply offended. I'd never. Ok, maybe just a little sabotage. Ruining the cheer championship is only gonna prove their worst fears. That zombies are monsters. They think that anyway. At least you have the guts to stand up for yourself. I say do it. Ok, you know what, Addison? You're not gonna change my mind. Wait, you agree with me? Ok, I like this girl. Sabotage isn't the zombie way. It's not who we are. It's not who you are. I'm not a monster. I'm a zombie. You're a cheerleader. You're not gonna change the world through sabotage. You change the world through cheer. Ok, um, so no sabotage? No sabotage, Eliza. That's not who I am. That's not who we are. Seabrook's up next! [cheering] Put your hands together for our defending champions, a team that needs no introduction- But since we're doing it anyway, it might as well be over-blown and flashy. Here are the almighty outtasighty Seabrook Shrimp that are mighty! [cheering] Go Seabrook! Go Mighty Shrimps! Go Seabrook! The sweetest type of sabotage. Self-sabotage. [laughing] Seconds in and Seabrook is literally falling apart. Get off the stage, Bucky! What's that sound? I- I think they're booing us. Oh, there seems to be technical difficulties with Seabrook's audio track. You have one job. Let's go Seabrook Cheer! Get off the stage, zombie! [cheering] [crowd booing] What is she doing? She's changing things. By cheering. But that's not how change works. You can't just change things with one person and a pair of pom poms. Yeah, you're right. It's gonna take more than just one person. It's gonna take all of us. Like they'll ever see us as normal. They won't. Because we're not normal. And they need to see that. Zombies celebrate their differences. So let's go out there and celebrate. Cheer championship style. You guys in? Za. So this is a revolution? Yeah, this is our revolution. Ok, but does it have to be cheer, though? Come on. Bucky, things can change. Look, change is happening, Bucky. And we're not going away. So you can either fight us and lose or you can be a part of it. I can't. I guess we need a new captain. Alright, here's the plan. We're gonna let our freak flags fly.
