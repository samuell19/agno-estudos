Nita, is only a superstition. Do not worry. Come here. Ok. What I saw Musashi was only an illusion Agreed. Have not you matured? When Musashi learned what Ultraman first on... I still remember that? Mari I'm not lying. I know Ultraman Is something wrong? I was afraid of thunder. Tutomu is more mature. How do you say that? Take this. Stop! Musashi. Here I am. Mari, this is very hard We can pick from this cliff. But can we leave here Shouji? She has fainted. And there's place I love show tonight. The Mermaid should be... ...in place that will show you.

We were really worried After receiving the message from Mari, you are in the bank. Musashi, you're stronger. Kido... I have never been imagined as able to see you were here. We have not seen in 10 years. Really... It's really memorable These are our Team Sea members. Team Sea? To research large sea monsters CRS and partners to protect the other forces to protect them. Now we move the headquarters in Rota Island. Searching for Mari. According to information provided by Musashi. Rota Island Headquarters Team Sea It was a monster named Rika. Taking ecological data was the first Team Sea mission... A fish-like monster line but a year ago Rika suddenly went. And then happened one strange phenomenon. Someone saw the Mermaid. Captain. It is the same channel again. We found that Sukopis has shattered the shield. The terrifying threat can coming from the universe. Mari Is Mari? Musashi, go to "Blue Area" I found a large object approaching into the atmosphere. I show the image. This is the monster that destroyed Jyuran. That is Sukopis. What is that? It's a monster! Sukopis is in Saipan. I see... We must protect Saipan. Team Sea. Let's go! Understand! Musashi, can you give us a hand? Yes. Hurry. Work hard. We over! A shadow below us. Rika? Are you going to Sukopis? Stop! Launching missiles freezing! Tutomu Musashi Are you all right? Nita has sprained ankle but okay. Really? The effect of freezing missile is only 30 minutes. Now go. Do it. Do it. You have to be careful. Rika!! Rika, give Sukopis a lethal blow. This is dangerous. Hide. I can not escape. I have to protect the "Blue Area". This is the mission that I must complete. Don't tell me... Damn Sukopis. Yes I do... Rika! Cosmos! Cosmos never come back. Now, escape! Good. Great. Are you okay? Why do not you just stayed out of this. Sukopis not escape? Sandros returned to when be sure I will. This is an atom bomb. He lost this temper. Sukopis not should have escaped. You're still willing to sacrifice. Shau That is my name. Shau I am Musashi. Haruno Musashi Mari is on our side. Come to our area, "Blue Area". "Blue Area"? Who is going with to Rika? Captain, I found waves K2 in the ocean. Waves K2? It was the strange electronic wave find Rika's chest. It was a good communication tool. Is it a language of deep sea? What's wrong? Captain, look! There's the door. Captain! This is it. There must be another world underwater. Look, the fish are swimming. That's right. This is... "Blue Area". See It's wonderful. How broad is this area? It's like a dream. Captain Kohikan, what are you doing? This is the seabed. What are you doing? Do not worry... no air. It's painful. I can not stand. I do not think that everything is artificial. But this world is still lacking something. Something missing? That's it. Why bring humans here? Is that you? I remember you. Everything must end. Humans are selfish. Knowing the "Blue Area". It will bring trouble! Stop! Humans are not so selfish, Jin. Shau, why think that? I do not know... But I feel that... Thanks Thank you for trusting us. Do not know what it means to shake hands. Really? Look, shaking hands transfer our sympathy. In the land... this means that we are not hostile. Mari! Musashi Mari!! This is really makes no sense. I did not know Mari helped Shau with the investigation. According to what was know of the earth, Shau needed some help. My internet friends recommended me Friends from the internet? Mari, how are you? The boy from Parasutan? Musashi, have grown a lot A long time ago... Do you still remember me? I'm glad. But why Parasutan would be involved in this world? Contacted him. This is an investigation to retrieve things in the universe. Lost everything in the universe? And what used to be a beautiful planet. But it was destroyed by invading a weapon. Posted by Sandras, and turned it into a desert planet. Sika to revive naturally we began a journey to model for a planet. But that Sandras like arid deserts discovered our plan. He killed many of my men We managed to escape on a tour of the ultra-space, but Sukopis did not give They caught us But when we had all lost hope at that point... Cosmos! No... that giant is... He's a legend on our planet. God is a splendid that shines in the universe. A splendid God? Another Ultraman. This is amazing I can not believe that something well is underground?! Shau worked here with your investigation. Investigation? Take care. This water tank is... It is the most important tool research. What experiment are you working? Lives... What this world is lacking is a sea conducive to all forms of life. And the scenery? It is an artificial birth of life It seems perfect as scientific data. But many times we tried The splendor of life is transient Captain Ultra-Ankor has detected the situation Sukopis. Return to earth in 7 days. Will they come back? You really know how to attack Sukopis? Correct. Use the Waves K2. Waves K2? Jin invented an energy shield from the electronic wave Rika made put an okay. So it's an energy shield protect what the "Blue Area". Captain Kido, why are you so sure that the "Blue Area" will not be invaded? Is the land? They want to reclaim their cities. Those monsters will attack the marine world and then come ashore. We will do more harm if we partner with the aliens? You want them let the earth? How can you become friends with them? What they say is that we work together to defend ourselves from Sukopis? Unidentified Alien. If there is an accident... of course we should strengthen our plan of attack.
