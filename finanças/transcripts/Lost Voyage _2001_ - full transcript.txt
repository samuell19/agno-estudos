Here you go, Aaron. - Oh, that's nice. - Like it? That's good. Right this way. Hi. Hi, how are you? - Permission to board? - Hi, right this way. Thank you. Now we'll be back sunday. You listen to grandma and do your chores, okay? Why can't I go with you? Aaron, we talked about this in the car. Now this is our honeymoon. It's our alone time. Aaron, I know you're still not used to all this, But... I care very much for you and your father. We got you something. Here. Well, aren't you going to open it? - Aaron, what are you doing? - She's not my mother! Aaron, that's a terrible thing to say. What's the matter with you? She's not my mother. My mother's dead. Honey, hold on, Hold on. Aaron, why are you acting like this? Aaron, get back here. Aaron said some really mean things. I'm sorry you had to hear that. He's young. He'll accept me when he's ready, honey. Think he hates me? Of course not. He's a little boy... Who lost his mother. Parker, Give it time. Okay? Give him time. He'll come around. Come here. Captain on the bridge. - That a reflective signal? - Yes, sir. Sir, that signal is advancing. Less than 400 yards and closing. Ever see a squall line give off a signal like that? No, sir. Sir, it looks like... Like land. No, that's impossible. There's no land for 200 miles. Sir, signal closing now at less than 200 yards. Captain, look! Starboard bow. Oh, my god. Engine room, full reverse screws. - Hard starboard! - Hard starboard, sir. - Parker, what's happening? - I don't know. - Full ahead. Hard port! - Hard port, aye, sir! She's not coming around. We're not going to make it! Captain. Here. What is it? When the Mary Celeste was discovered 11 days after her disappearance, The captain, his wife and daughter And a crew of eight seemed to vanish into thin air. Now the boat was in remarkably good condition, And some reports indicate That a meal was still cooking on the stove in the galley, And that warm coffee cups remained intact In the mess hall. The Mary Celeste remains One of the most baffling and mysterious cases In the history of humankind. The Mary Celeste remains one of the most baffling and mysterious cases In the history of the region Known as The Bermuda Triangle. The Mary Celeste is one of the most baffling And terrifying, And mysterious, confusing... Baffling and mysterious! The Mary Celeste is... One of the most... Aw, crap. That's always bothered you, Hasn't it? I'm... I'm sorry. Do I know you? The similarities Between the two cases Are remarkable. What two cases? The Mary Celeste And the Corona Queen. No, not really. The Corona Queen's Never been found. No, but we have To get on with our lives. - Goodbye. - Excuse me, how did You get in here? Hey, I was just Coming to see you. Did you just see a guy Come out of my office? Just now. A tall guy. No. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. I just thought I saw someone. Umm... You wanted To see me? - Yeah. - Come on. - Have you heard? - Heard what? You really need To get out of the office more. I just heard on the radio. The coast guard is reporting That a fishing boat Found it. - Found what? - The Corona Queen. Not many details But it's all over the news. I'm really surprised You haven't heard. - Where? - Off the bermuda islands. Is there a storm brewing Out there? Yeah. That's one of the reasons They haven't gone back out. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sometimes I just hate Being right. You're talking About that triangle theory? Well, don't let holdstein Get wind of it, Or he'll rake you Over the coals again. - Remember last time? - Holdstein is an idiot With no imagination. He has no business Running this institute. Maybe not. But he brings in The funding. And you have to admit, Some of your stuff is A little out there. Mary, quantum physics aside, We study psychic And paranormal phenomena. Everything we do Is a little bit out there. You really need to think About taking a vacation. And then, My dead husband Returned from the grave. You think something like that Can't happen to you, But it can. From your deceased husband? I don't know. But there I was, In my kitchen, Canning peaches And I seen him there. This is really bad. I can't show this To the network. Hey, you pick 'em. I just shoot 'em. - Hey, jules. - Randall. - Here are The morning transcripts. - Thank you. Dana, you're still taking Your vacation next month? Yes. Why? I just wanted to ask you If you would consider Letting me take The brownsville assignment? Well... I don't know how comfortable I am with that. Okay, But I already Ran it by kaplan, And he thought it was A really good idea. Oh. You don't think I went behind your back? No. No, no. It's all right. Just slow down a little. Your chance will come, okay? Thanks, dana. I appreciate it. No, no, no. Really, it's all right. Hey, what you Got there, dee? Julie, get everything you can On the bermuda triangle And a passenger ship Called the Corona Queen. Randall, Get a field package together. What? Betacam, Couple of radio mics? No, no, no. Whole enchilada. Infrared, time-lapse. - Loading up for bear? - And lions, and tigers. Right on. Where are we going? Randall and i Are checking out a story. come in. - Hey. - Hello. - Hear you got a big one. - Looks that way. - I'm working An angle right now. - Great, great. - Listen, you got a minute? - Sure. - I've been talking To the suits. - And? And... There seems To be some concern About the ratings, Some talk about new blood. Julie. Well, she's attractive, She's bright. She fits right into The 18 to 35 demographic. - What, so I'm too old now? - Nobody is saying that. They just want To try her out Once in awhile. You know, throw her A field assignment Now and then. What about me? I have spent The past three years Trying to build this show Into something respectable. And you've done A great job. But just... They feel it's time For a change. Mike, I'm onto A big story right now. Can we do this later? Well, we can do it Anytime you want, dana. But it's time for julie To start moving up. Don't fight me on this. Is that a threat? No, it's Good career advice. Hi. Aaron roberts? - I'm dana. - Dana elway. - Nice to meet you. - You watch my show? "journals of the unexplained"? Sometimes. You look better in person. Oh, thank you. I think. I know what you're here for. Would you like to come in? Thanks. Mr. Roberts, I'm a little Pressed for time, So can I get To the point? I would like you To see something first. Okay. This picture was taken When I was eight years old. And every couple Of years Someone is nosing around Looking for a new angle On an old story. But this time There is a story. I'd really like An exclusive. And considering Your background, You're a wonderful choice. This is big news for us. Yeah, right. Will it air before The two-headed alien baby, Or after "i took a shower With satan"? That was actually One of our highest-rated shows, And I doubt that this Would even come close. Well, would it help If I had some horns? Very funny. Look, think about it. You... A young boy... Saying goodbye To your parents Before the Corona Queen Disappears Into the bermuda triangle. And then, years later, The ship returns, And you go aboard To say your final goodbye. Go aboard? I'm flying out to the ship In four hours. Will you go? I don't know. Look... Look, mr. Roberts, Let me be Straight with you. I need this story. I think it would Be good for both of us. How's that? I've done my homework. I know about your work In parapsychology, And I know about your interest In the bermuda triangle. We talk the same language. I don't think so. I see the paranormal As a field of scientific study. You see it as a way To exploit people's fears. Now, i've spent the last 15 years fighting against The sort of stories that The media fabricates. And besides, My interest in the triangle is... It's purely personal. It's not sanctioned By the institute. You can't tell me That you aren't intrigued. Well, I would be lying If I said I wasn't Itching to go with you. Then do. I'm sorry. I just don't feel comfortable With you exploiting My father's death For tv ratings. I understand. Umm... If you change your mind. You know, i was Kind of expecting The hard sell. No, that's dean lawson From "the adventures Of the paranormal." We're the good guys. Bye. i want to thank you, You've helped me so much. thank you so much. It's been great. I'm really excited. I can't wait to start. - Goodbye. - Bye bye. Hey, dana. - So, how's the story going? - We've got a helicopter. Just a few of the details To work out. - We leave in a couple of hours. - Good, good, good. - Yeah. - Listen, One thing. Julie's going with you. Why? Randall and I can Handle this. I know, I know, I know. But she's got to get Some experience in the field If she's going To take over for you While you're on vacation Next month. It is just a vacation, mike, Isn't it? Or do I need to start Working on my resume? What's the matter? You worried she may get Better ratings than you? What kind of ratings Are we talking about? The only kind that matter. Hon, this is business. It's not personal. Fine. I hope she's ready. There she blows! Are you guys Out of your minds? Hey! What's going on In there? For christ's sake, We could all die here! Hello. Hello? - Mr. Shaw? - You're late. Uh, randall, this is david shaw, He works with crescent cruises. They operated The Corona Queen. Randall banks, Cameraman. Julie largo, Field correspondent. Hi. This is him And that's him. My two best salvage operators. Randall, julie, why don't You start loading the equipment? - Sure. - Yeah. Thanks for helping out On such short notice. No problem. Did you hold up with your end Of the arrangement? Yeah. Half now, Half when we get back. What are you waiting for? - We've got one more person. - No, we've got to take off. - The storm is getting worse. - Come on, just give me Two more minutes. Listen, this storm's going To be a bitch and a half. We're not going to make it If we don't leave now. Great timing. One more minute And you would have missed us. - Come on. - Wait, wait, wait. We're going to do this On my terms, right? No theatrics, No melodrama. I mean, otherwise, I'm just... I'm going to stay here, okay? Okay. I'm trusting you. All right. Let's go. Okay. Hi, my name is david shaw, Crescent cruises. Aaron roberts. You look familiar. Could be. My family sued Your company. My father and stepmother Were on the Corona. That was before my time. What's all that stuff? It's my field gear. What sort of gear? Paranormal research stuff. Measures all kinds Of phenomena. What sort of phenomena? We'll have to find that out When we get there, won't we? This is our third pass. So what's your point? I don't have the fuel For an extended search In these winds. Do we match The coast guard coordinates? I don't know, wind and currents Might have moved the ship. Just find the ship, please. You want in on this? Thirsty? No, thanks. I went sober Three years ago. Wow. Yeah. So what do you guys think about This bermuda triangle stuff? Wives' tale, Or the real deal? You mean what's behind All the pilots and planes Disappearing? Yeah. Storms. Bad navigation. Faulty instruments. It's a big pond. People get lost. Unless you believe The legend. What legend? Some people say The triangle Is like a door To someplace else. Sometimes the door Opens one way. Sometimes the other. A door to where? That's the question, Isn't it? Some people say The door opens To the very bowels Of hell itself. Well, there is some research That seems to substantiate That theory. Then again, It may just be A boatload of bullshit. - What the hell was that? - That would be turbulence. No shit. What the hell is this, A pager? Pager, no. But it gets the message across. Give me two. So, mr. Roberts, Your parents was on this tub 25 years ago, eh? Yeah. Parents got on the ship, Ship disappears, Ship comes back. Tough break. Yeah. You got anything? I got something Out here. That's it. That's the Corona Queen! - Don't get excited about it. - What else could it be? - It might be a naval target. - That's the Corona Queen. Wish me luck. That's it. Get him out. Get back. Drop our supplies. I can't hold her Much longer. Just hover over long enough To drop our goddamn supplies! Heads up, heads up. Alright, let's take this stuff And get inside. You two, unload it. What do you think Happened in here? Das? Small explosion Or charge could've Taken those out. Almost looks Like they were attacked. Attacked by what? There was a lot Of piracy in the '70s. Not usually On cruise ships, though. Ah, hijacking More likely. Terrorists. Looks like They just came in here And blew everyone All to hell. What do you suppose Happened to the bodies then? Look, fields, let's get Some kind of cover Over these windows. We'll save what's left Of this equipment. Why don't we set up In the... Crew's mess, Down below? We're standing on The Corona Queen, A passenger ship That has reappeared After being officially listed As missing for 25 years. The last time Aaron roberts Saw his parents alive, They were boarding This very ship. Aaron, what are You feeling? Aaron? What am I feeling? - Yeah. - I feel... Wet, A little hungry... And a little concerned That your pilot flew off With one of my bags. I thought you came with us To be part of the story. And I thought we had An agreement. I can't get inside of your head If you don't give me A straight answer. I don't remember inviting you Inside my head. I'm sorry. It must be difficult Being here. I'm glad I brought This down first, Otherwise this whole trip Would be one big waste of time. This here is a standard Witch-hunt package. Three high-8 digicams, Two infrared ccd cameras, One full spectrum cam, Two sennheiser 416 mics, And a parabolic dish. - What's that thing? - It measures atmospheric Variances. When a spirit or entity Passes through a room, It leaves behind a sort Of a footprint in the air. Atmospheric variance, huh? Emg imager. This lets us see ripples Or displacement Caused by an entity In the area. That's the old model. This is the latest. Totally clean. No more false positive readings. Cool. Hey. We covered up the windows. I don't know how much good It will do. Most of the panels are Already rusted through. Aside from the bridge... There's no damage Or corrosion so far. After 25 years at sea, She's looking pretty good. Pretty weird. This tub hasn't aged a day Since she disappeared. 10 years on the high seas, I've never seen anything Like it. All right, let's Get down to business. While we're aboard this ship, I'm your captain. No questions, No arguments, No bullshit. Nobody goes off by themselves Without telling others. We don't know What happened here. I would stay out of The passenger area for awhile. You can get your story, But we don't want anybody Hurt on this trip. All right? Das, fields, see if you can Get some power on. We need some light. Okay, we're On a time crunch here. We got 24 hours To get this ship ready To be towed By my salvage crew. Otherwise we lose it To the us-goddamn-coast guard. Okay. Clock's ticking. - We'd better go find the genny. - All right. Hey, do you guys mind If I tag along? I just want To get some readings. It's fine with me. I'd like to get some Background on the ship first. - History, that kind of stuff. - I'll help you any way I can. - Just remember what I said. - Yeah. Okay, clock's ticking. Let's go. Well, this is not the most Luxurious ship I've ever seen. Yeah, I know what you mean. The new ones are like Floating casinos and such. It was a bit different Back in the day. What kind Of a salvage operation Is shaw having you run? The illegal kind. - What do you mean? - We're like the military. Don't ask, don't tell. You see, mr. Roberts, We ain't exactly Supposed to be On this ship right now. But money talks. And bullshit walks. How much you think Shaw's getting? It's got to be something To get us out here so fast, Middle of the night. I'll tell you one thing. The salvage on this tub's Going to be worth A hell of a lot more Than the five bills He's paying us. Damn straight, das. Damn straight. Yeah, here we go. Hey, hold on. What's down there? That be the crew galley. Okay, i'll meet up With you later. Better take this. - Oh, thanks. - Oh, and, uh, I wouldn't open Any freezers. Why? 25 years worth Of stink, i'd imagine. Das, tell him about The tuna tender off malaysia. This ship had only been Stranded out there Five or six months, And we jumped into the hold Where they keep the fish. Right up to our dicks In maggots. - Have fun. - Thanks. Maggots. I'd be surprised If this piece of shit Even turns over. Be a bleeding miracle. Jesus. There's definitely Something going on here. David, tell us about The history of the ship Before her disappearance. All right, i'll try. The Corona Queen Was the sixth ship In the crescent fleet. Her maiden voyage was On january 22nd of 1968. Her first captain was Willard townes, And the second was Stan moore. She carried 325 passengers And crew. She had twin turbine engines Built in england. And then in july Of 1972, She disappeared... Without a trace Until now. Hey, roberts. Excuse me. Randall, cut it. We'll pick it up later. All right. I thought I told you Not to wander off alone. I'm just taking Some readings. Let me reiterate. I don't give a shit. When you're on this ship, You do what I tell you, You understand? yes. Okay... Hey, das, Good work. Genny came right up. Pretty fucking weird. We're firing The electrical panels up now. - What's with the music? - Oh, sorry about the music. We'll have it off In a minute. Oooh. Just turn it off. - Could we continue? - Yeah. All right. wait. Wait, shh. It's as though the mic's Picking up something. What is it? Where's It coming from? Think it's coming From over here. It's like a squeaking. There. Right there. - Nobody touch it. - We are on water. Things move When the ship moves. I don't think so. That seems more like... Oh, man. Seems more like what? Like someone is riding it. Hey, guys, If I'm reading this right, - This room is hot. - Hot? - Lots of Psychokinetic energy. - Okay, why this room? Sometimes children Are more susceptible To paranormal activities. Oh, come on. You should take a look At these drawings. Look at the eyes. What is that? I don't know. Something... Something happened In here. Okay, what the hell Was that? I want to get Some gear in here now. I ain't got time For this crap. This is what We came for. The Corona Queen was the sixth ship. All right, there's no leakage or structural damage On engineering deck. I wouldn't count On the engines though. They're wrecked. Half the lights are down. You got enough power To run the pumps? We're working on it. Good. - Did you see that? - What? - Go back. - What? - Hey, shaw? - Yeah. You might want To look at this. What? Oh, my god. Now. I'll try the substation panel On a deck. Don't bother. I can get it from down here. Bet I can get This whole tub lit Before you can get A single bulb hot, das. Case of scotch Says you don't. You're on. Hey, can I ask you something? Sure. Umm... Have you ever seen Anything like that before? Nope. Nothing like that. Most of my work Is clinical. Ghosts are a side interest. Well, it's just that... You seem awfully damn calm. I mean, I feel all freaky, Like my stomach Just dropped out. You should be happy. I know people that would Kill for what you shot today. If we make it back With the footage. Yeah. Dana, i've got One camera up. I'll have the others up In a minute. Over. Okay, copy that. I'm so sorry. Shit. I've already got Half my junction boxes up. You're getting old, das. Yeah? I already got Decks b through d lit. I'd say it looks like You're getting slow, fieldsy. I'll have this crate passed Faster than prune juice Through your grandma. Come on, come on. Come on. I'm going to hit the relays On the main breaker again. Come on. Come on, baby. Okay, here we go. All right. Hold on, I'm... What was that, fields? I said, hold... Say again? You're messing with me. I cannot afford a case Of scotch. I said hold... Fields? ...rewiring The connector panel. Fucking radios. Fields?! Fields! Das, what's going on? It's fieldsy. Something's happened. On my way. Fields? Ohhh. Jesus christ. Aw, jeez. - What's this? - The deal's off. - No way. - We've got to get Off this ship. I tried to contact the Coast guard, but the Radios are all down. You tried to reach The coast guard? There's a man dead On this ship. They're going to want To interview everybody. We are not supposed To be here, you know that, shaw. - What are you talking about? - I'm saying the coast guard Doesn't know we're here, And if they did, They wouldn't like it very much. That's too goddamn bad. My best friend's laying Down there dead, And you're worried About the fucking coast guard. - I'm sorry About your friend... - Bullshit. We only came here For a story, all right? A man is dead. We are in deep shit, lady. - We didn't kill him! - I'm not pointing any fingers! - I bet you like this, Don't you, julie? - Don't put your shit on me! shut up! Shut up, all of you! Christ, fields is dead. That's it. No arguments, No bullshit. It's time to go. What the fuck? Hello? It's for you. Hello? Where? What? hello? Hello? It was fields. What did he say? What did he say? There's... there's something We should see up on the bridge. Wait, should we be Doing this? - Probably not. - I don't give a rat's ass, I'm going in. What are we supposed to find here? You got me. What is that? I don't know, But it's huge. Distance at that rate is Closing at a fairly Constant speed. It's moving Straight for us. How long before it's here? I don't know, three, Four hours tops. So fields was trying To warn us. Yeah, but from what? See if you can Get that radio working. I'm going to sickbay, There'll be body bags there. The rest of you Get your gear together. - What for? - Because we're leaving. - Roberts, why don't you Come with me? - Where are we going? To get fields' body. Damn it, he was right here. - You sure he was dead? - Yes, I'm sure. Then where is he? I don't know, but dead men Don't get up and walk away, Do they? - And you're sure about that? - Come on, roberts. Let's not talk in circles. You're supposed to be The expert. Why don't you help me here? It probably was an accident. A horrible accident. - But there are Other possibilities. - Such as? - How long have you been In this business? - All my life, why? Then you've heard stories About the triangle, About the ships That come back. - Yeah, it's all horseshit. - Is it? yeah. Look around. I've spent a long time trying To explain what happened To this ship, What happened to my father. But what we've seen today... - It defies explanation. - That's it. That's it. I've heard Enough of this crap. - Shaw! - What? Have you looked For the captain's log yet? No. Why? Find it. What for? What for? I don't know exactly. It's just a feeling, But you're Giving the orders. Goddamn it, das, Why don't you keep The walkie on? - I got the radio up. - I'm looking for you Everywhere! I got the radio up! Listen. Go ahead, salvage. I said it's going to be three hours at least Before I can make it back, More like four. I still have to refuel And that storm front Is building. - Four hours? We have a situation here. - Come on, come on. I copy that, Corona, But in case you hadn't noticed, There's a hurricane heading Your direction. - Shit. - Just get out here And get us off this ship! Salvage, do you copy? Salvage, come back. - Get him back. - Salvage, come back. - Did you take care of fields? - No, I didn't. Because the body's gone! What the hell Are you talking about? This isn't a storm. Whatever this is, It's moving in fast. I don't give a shit about this! What about fields? You got him killed, Now you gonna get The rest of us killed? He knew what He signed on for! - I ought to kill you right now! - You've crossed the line. - Have i? - You're fired! yeah, you're fired. - I'm fired? - Yeah, get out!

Fields was right. A lot of my research points To the fact that the triangle is Some sort of doorway or portal. - To where? - To somewhere else. Hell, another dimension. A place where We don't belong. The place where this ship Went to when it disappeared. But it came back, Didn't it? - You found it? - Yeah. Maybe you can help me Understand some of this. First entry, May 13th, 1972. "i don't know What this place is. We have no radio, No navigation. I have no control Of the ship. They have slaughtered Most of the crew And the passengers. And the rest have Simply vanished. The children Were the last to go." I read that 20 times. "something is Coming for me. I can hear it Outside the door." Who the fuck is this "they"? Who is "they"? How the hell Am I supposed to know? "i can hear it Outside my door." And there's something else. - What? - What? Well, the ship... It was on the other side For a long time. And? - Do you know What a capacitor is? - Of course. I think the Corona Queen Has somehow become A capacitor, Storing energy From the other side. You mean like evil? Listen, we can call it whatever We want, but there is An intelligence here, And it's an intelligence That's been locked On the other side For a very long time. So now we can no longer trust What we see or what we hear. The ship is preying On our fears. It is creating things For us to see. One way or another, We have to get off this ship And away from that line On the radar. What is that thing? What, is it a storm, or what? Maybe the physical Boundaries Between our world... And another. I mean, maybe it's The physical boundaries Of the triangle itself. Oh, okay. That's phenomenal. A doorway to hell. We are fucked. I came on the ship... It was to do a story, man. I did not sign on For this bullshit! Listen, we are going To get off this ship. But we have got To get those tapes. Dana, fuck the tapes. We got to get off the ship! You know he's right. We can't take any chances. Listen to me. This is the story Of a lifetime. We have come too far To go back empty-handed. So we have got To get those tapes. So we get the tapes, Then we get off the ship. Okay, fine. Does anybody have A problem with that? You go get the tapes, And we'll all meet Up on deck. If the chopper's there We fly. If it's not, We get in the boats. - I'll be back. - Where the hell Are you going? There's something I got to do. Don't leave without me! Randall, go to the playroom. I'll get everything here. Where will it be... Jesus, come on. What the hell Is he doing? What the fuck is Wrong with this piece of shit? come on. Okay. That's fucked up. Jeez, you scared The shit out of me. Where the hell Have you been? Randall... Randall, who are you Talking to? We've been looking All over this ship For your butt. What? Hey, jules? Randall! randall! Randall? Randall! Shaw, is there any sign Of the helicopter? The chopper's On its way! Let's go! The winds are too strong! Go aft, I don't want To get caught in the rigging! He says we've got to go aft, There's too much wind. He's going to get caught In the rigging. Oh, god. Here. What's happening? Good god. Oh, baby. Dana, let's go! Dana! Come on, Come on! Corona Queen to chopper. Corona Queen to chopper. What the hell is going on? Do not leave Without us! Come on, dana, Let's go. Dana! Dana! I'll be right back. Mom. Okay. Dana? I'm sorry. Grab it. Dana? I only wanted To help you. I didn't... I never wanted To hurt you. Oh, shit! I couldn't stand To see you in so much pain. Dana, are you all right? My mom... I killed her. Dana, I'm sure that's not true. Now, listen to me. What you're seeing Is not real! Dana, snap out of it! We've got to go! Let me get the tapes. Come on. You okay? let's go! Oh, my god. - What is this? - Let's go, let's go. Quick. Quick! Come on! - Come on, go! - Come on! This is steep now. - You okay? Go ahead. - Yeah. - Come on. - Okay. Go. Lower the basket! Lower the basket! Lower! Hurry up down there. Well, well, well. Congratulations. You got the story Of the century. I don't know if it was Worth the deaths Of five people. Yeah, well, Welcome to television. That's always bothered you, hasn't it? I'm... I'm sorry, Do I know you? The similarities between The two cases are remarkable. - What two cases? - The Mary Celeste and the Corona Queen. Not really. The Corona Queen's never been found. No, but we have to get on with our lives. Goodbye, son. But we have to get on with our lives. Goodbye, son. Hi. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Finally. You? Yeah, I'm okay. It's been an interesting Couple of days. Let's just say... I'm through carrying guilt For something that wasn't My fault. You ready? - Ready? - Yeah. Oh, I forgot, Didn't i?
