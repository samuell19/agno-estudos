I want you to go out looking good, Harry, one of a proud breed. Uh-huh. Remember you're a seller. There's not just a salesman in the world, but the sellers, they're a race apart. Remember when they used to come up and shove it right in our pockets, Harry? The last of the Champions. Come here and give me a kiss. Wouldn't let you see these before with that bad ticker you have got, but these are yours now, mate. Oh, these are disgusting. Mhm. I'm a family man. So that's the difference between you and me, Harry. Yeah? You've wasted years in here studying anatomy. Mm-hmm. While I've been in the library developing the scam of the century. Is it true, Cec? It's all planned. It's all on paper. What good is it to me? I'm just a poor old man who's gonna die in this stinking prison because that rotten mongrel of a governor won't give a dying man a medical pardon. You'll never see me again, pal. That I'll do. Are you coming or staying, Harry? Don't rush me. It's a big thing leaving home. Who's going home? I'm gonna miss you, mate. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Cell by myself. Come up here for me, Harry. I'll have two for you. Harry Reynolds, you steal from a dying man! Poor old Cec, misses me already. You thieving mongrel! You've stolen my life's work! Paranoid now, of course. I'll get you for this! It's prime real estate. If I sent to you an account-- - See you, Mick. - See you, Harry. --for the time that I've spent seeing your client in this human garbage dump-- --property is not bullshit. I have just seen your client, and he will not be signing the paper giving me control. Does this jailbird think he's going back to selling bonds? A Montblanc, a driver's license, one snapshot female porn. Oh, great. Mate, I could not give a stuff about his wife and kids. I'm a real estate developer, not a bloody registered charity. All right, I'll tell him. Mr. Bostock-- --charitable act by a convicted criminal. --taxi outside. Look, I'll toss him a line for a price, his signature on the contract today. Well, that's it, Harry. I'm the only one offering him money right now. See you next time. Maybe we'll share a cell. No offense, just a joke, Tom. There you go. See you. Hey, Harry, that's my bloody name you signed. That's my name. It just looks like your name. You for Bostock? Yes. Oh, Bostock, Charlie Sanville. We met last year at a convention at the Regent, I think it was. Hey, listen. There's been a bit of a mix up with the taxis, your blokes broken down. I thought perhaps you'd like to share mine. Well, I need to get away from that scum in there. They should castrate the whole lot of them. You know what I mean? I've been seeing a client myself. Don't worry about this, I'll get it. Why wouldn't you? It's your cab. Yeah, right. Fair enough 'cause you'll be paying for everything else, Mr. Bostock. My hand shakes steady and my words are sweet, and the whole world's lying here at my feet. Put your trust in me. Oh! Oh, sorry. I rub my eyes-- - Cash or charge? Charge. --and I catch my breath. I'm almost choking on the smell of success. Put your trust in me. Hey, put your trust in me. Thank you, Mr. Bostock. Thank you. I get careless now and then. 31? I won't let you down again. 25. I got x-ray eyes. And with just one look, I can read your future like an open book. Put your trust in me, put your trust in me. There you are, Mr. Bostock. Portuguese, early 16 century. That's the one. My hand shakes steady and my words are sweet, and the whole world's lying here at my feet. Put your trust in me, put your trust in me. Most of the travelers don't come down here anymore. What travelers? You're a salesman, right? Who's a salesman? Have it your own way. But I'm telling you there's no money here. No money? The guts has fallen out of the bloody place. Why not? How are you? Great. Can't seem to find your reservation. That's strange. This is the Carinya guesthouse, isn't it? Yeah. My office was supposed to have made a booking. I'll just have to see what I can do for you. Good on you. I'll just have a wait. Shit. David! Single or double? Double. Yeah, with a double bed. You married? No, but I've got very long legs. Double cost more because of the mortgage. I think maybe you ought to get your old man. The booking was probably made with him. It's a big mortgage, and my father's in Brisbane with his dye blonde trollop. David, why don't you answer me. Mom said she had a bum reduction job. - Yeah? Sorry, I was in the kitchen. This man isn't married, but he wants to double bed. Is that OK? Yes, that's OK. And I'm sure he's not interested in Miss Brenda's little figure problem. Lively one. Uh, yes. Well, you can have your pick at the moment. There's a nice double overlooking the harborage. Beautiful. Not many views like that were I'm from. Washbasin, getting noise from the pub at night, dinner's at 6:00-- the locals insist. You're American, right? Uh-huh. Long way from home? No, this is my home. Just you and your son, is it? Yeah, just me and David. The, uh, burnt steak is at the pub across the road if you get sick of my cooking. I hope you don't mind sharing a bathroom. No, that's all right. I've shared a bathroom for the past five years. Oh, so you were married. No, we just lived together. We never had any spark. She's not my type physically. You stayed together for five years? It's hard to get out. I've been there. I like him. You don't know anything about him. But I think that you should charm his sights. David. Mom, I'm not matchmaking. Oh, yes you are. - Am not. - Am so. Not. Am so, am so. Well, no one around here is gonna ask you. I don't want them to ask me. HARRY REYNOLDS Dear Cec, I apologize for stealing your research, but with your bad ticker, you might die in there. And then the warden will be down here in Beachport making money off your hard work. Better me than him. If anything comes of it, I'll send you a split. Yeah, I'll bet. Look at it as a divorce settlement. Your friend for life, or five years max, whichever is longer, Harry Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds, I thought you'd like someone to show you around. I could give you the $7 guided tour of Beachport for only $6.30. That's 10% off. How old are you, mate? 10. So. Mr. Foster thinks there's an old Portuguese treasure ship buried in the sand dunes, hey? Everyone around town reckons Mr. Foster is a fruitcake. Good day, Mr. Lewis. - How are you? Morning. In here. What a wonderful place. Wonderful. 1530 Portuguese galleon, three masks, two taser guns carried broadside, treasure ship. Saint Sebastian, wrecked. Of the Azores. Harry, come here. Do you have him? It's, um, autographed by the author, me. That's you all right. Great photo. NORMAN FOSTER More astonishing than fiction, the legendary dune ship is a vital part of the history on which-- It's on special. Already got one. Harry. NORMAN FOSTER --will pose no harm [inaudible].. You a local, are you? No, my dad was. NORMAN FOSTER [ON TV]: Portuguese maps drawn in the 1530s-- What do we got here? NORMAN FOSTER [ON TV]: --show this part of the Australian coastline 250 years before Captain Cook claimed Australia for the British Empire. Relics found on the sand dunes near Beachport, uh, prove the theory that a Portuguese galleon was wrecked here in the 1520s. People have, uh, actually seen the remains of the ship, uh, in 1883. And in 1953, uh, another interesting observation by a champ who was unfortunately intoxicated at the time. Where did you get that? What? The Portuguese doubloon. Oh, that? That's just an old coin of my father's Well, where did your father get it? The sand. Your name is, uh-- Reynolds, Harry Reynolds. Reynolds, Reynolds. You said your father came from around here. Did I say that? Oh, yes, you did. Did I? Did your father find that-- I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. It's too premature. I can't really talk about my project yet. Excuse me. If your father found that here, it could be crucial. Morning, Mr. Foster. Wonderful place. See, Harry, I told you he was a fruitcake. Yeah, but a nice fruitcake. Don't touch anything. Boy, these things are great. Tough to find a parking spot for them. Good day. Any of this equipment still available? No, mate. They here 'cause they look good. No, it's not a problem, mate. They're all available. Jim, Jim, you see that guy over there? Don't look, don't look. Mhm, yes, yes. He's got a gold coin from the dune ship. He's father found it, our Mr. Reynolds. Mhm. He's a tall man. Mr. Reynolds is a short man, as I recall. No. He was skinny. No, no, don't look now. Three times a day, one hour before meals. OK? - All right, thanks a lot. - Bye-bye. - See you later. - Good day, Mr. Thomas. - How are you, David? - All right. - You sell stamps? Yeah, just the letter, is it? Yeah. $0.27, right? $0.41, they haven't been $0.27 in five years. Right, not a great correspondent. Thanks. This is a beauty. You like fishing? Yeah. Your dad teach you? No, I taught myself. My dad was never home. I had a dad like that. Goodbye. Oh, sorry. Can you fish? Of course, I can fish. I was born with a line in the hand. What do you use for bait? Bait? Mangoes. Mangoes? Yeah, up north we do. You don't. We do. Would I lie to you? Hey. Mr. Reynolds. Pillow fishing? This one's a bit small on throwing it back. They say the big ones run off the dock. You wanna come up? You need a new line. There's some men downstairs to see you. I'll be down in a minute. No, I know it's your idea, but so was last year's sand festival. Now just keep quiet, let me do the talking. All right. How can I help you, gentlemen? Jim Scraper. Jim. For my sins, I'm the mayor of this town. This is Harold Lewis. He's the editor of the local rag. Uh, how are you, Harold? How do you do? I believe you've met Mr. Foster. Indeed, love that museum. Thank you. So how are you enjoying Beachport? Uh, very much. Good, good. And the weather is up to your expectations? How could I ask for more? Wonderful weather, wonderful. You're here to dig up the dune ship. I am? It's the buried treasure, isn't it? No. Coin, he had a coin. You've come here to steal our treasure on the quiet. Absolutely not. Bottom line, Mr. Reynolds, you can't dig up the sand dunes unless the local counsel says you can. And who's the local counsel? Us. Yes, I'm here to find the dunes. I know where it is within 50 meters. Nobody knows exactly where it is. Satellite photos, computer enhanced, reveal a mass beneath the sand the size and shape of a Portuguese galleon. I have got to see those photos. No one sees it. Then why should we believe you? I'm not asking you to believe me. Just walk away and let me get on with it. Let you get on with what? The thing that'll save this town. What do you mean, what are you saying? The Japanese trawlers have taken your fishing, haven't they? Farmers have got the ass side of their strides, haven't they? You're dead in the water, but this one thing can save it. Tourism, that's where the real treasure is. You think we haven't tried that, hey? We've advertised, had competitions. You haven't tried the best thing that you've got going for you, romance. Romance? Here in Australia, we're being discovered by the international tourists. And here, right here in Beachport, we can sell them romance. Now how? I'll tell you how. We find that dune ship, and around the dune ship we build a theme park. It'll be like Disneyland. We'll call it dune ship park. And after it's working, we'll build another one on the Gold Coast and call it dune ship world. And you think of it. 450 years ago, gallant mariners set out from Europe and found here in the South Seas adventure, danger, death. I see. I can see Portuguese sailors dressed in exotic costumes, conquistadors, buried treasure and caravans. Oh, come down to Earth. This place will rival the Gold Coast of Queensland. It'll be Australia's Miami. Now hang on, hang on. You're talking real money here. Mr. Mayor, I am talking real money. I'm talking money, money, money-- buckets of lovely money. Now, 40 years ago the Gold Coast of Queensland was one pub and a lot of holiday shacks. And now it's a billion dollar tourist playground, built on what? Listen, we could never be the Gold Coast. It's bullshit, I mean-- Yeah, correct, built on bullshit. A billion dollars of tourism built on bullshit, built on a high. Yes. But do you want to be rich? Oh, yeah. You want your, uh, miserable little bits of real estate to become choice blocks with a million dollars? That would be nice. Nice. Well, let me get on with this my own way, please. He's got the photos! Gold mine, yes. Those are my photos! He's walking away. Those are my photos! Quick, quick-- You're disturbing my [inaudible].. You're the head. You-- you talk to him. Come on. Reynolds, you count us in or you don't dig. Well, I suppose 5% labor participation isn't going to kill me. Now that's 5% of the 100%. 5% of 25%. Oh, no, no. No. Hey, listen. This has been my dream. I deserve the lion's share. Forget it, Reynolds. Hey, please. OK, 5% of 100%, that's a $50,000 seed money, and I won't take a penny more. 75 then. All right, 100. You can put in $100,000, but you have to give me unconditional development right of the dunes for five years. If that doesn't satisfy you bloodsucking vultures, then stuff it because I'm out. O-U-T, out! Local money can put in 100,000, that's 100,000. That represents 10% of net profit. I worked for years, I get screwed by a bunch of hillbillies. Well, thanks, fellas. My old man was right about this place, talk about greedy. You lucky if my share covers our hotel bill. You'll notice that the excavation site, based on the evidence in my book, is a long way from the ocean. This is because over the past 400 years, there's been massive shifts on the shape of the shoreline here. So when the Portuguese came here, the Egyptians and perhaps even the ancient Phoenician-- Out there in section A-- you folks with the shovels, you might as well lean on them. I need you for a minute. Now this is how they discovered the pyramid, you know. There's no telling what else far down here. This could be bigger than the pyramid. Of course, you got to be a bit careful, like digging for eggs. Golden goose eggs! Oh, no, Mr. Mayor. We've got to keep everyone out of this roped off area here. Can't afford to disturb the surface. Can I leave that with you to fix up? OK, great. Hey, Harry, my fish are running. Yeah? Got the mango. Beauty. You reckon we'll find the dune ship? Well, if it's there to be found, we'll find it. Will it have masts? It's hard to tell. It's been there a long time. How big will it be? I'll lend you the book. You can learn a lot from books. OK. Let's go. This is a fantastic place. Yeah, but all my friends are in Sydney. This is better than Sydney. Wish I'd grown up in a place like this. Down here, Harry. What's the matter? Northeasterly, not good for mangoes. You'll have to use what you know when you're down here. These cost a $1.60. We'll eat it or we'll save it to catch tropical fish. OK. Ooh! You are dangerous. Born with a line in your hand, hey? Give me your yo-yo. What are you gonna do, catch a fish with it? Just give me your yo-yo. Eiffel Tower. Texas Star. Over the Falls-- Wow. --and Rock the Baby. Now, I may not know everything, but I know yo-yos. So let's make a deal. I'll take you and you teach me, OK? Yeah, yeah, let me help you with that. Wow. Yeah. Now what you do-- see, when you cast it out, remember, you push this thing out and turn that. You see? Yeah. Cast it out and just wait for a nibble, OK. Right, watch this. You ready? See, Harry. Wow, that's my best. Go on, you can do it. Yeah, good arm. Pretty good, hey? Yeah, quick learner. What's your dad do for a living? He's a salesman. You're a salesman, aren't you, Harry? No, I'm a seller. What's the difference? A salesman goes to people and tries to get them to buy things. But a seller, people come to him and take things and shove money in his pocket. Mhm. Well, Mr. Reynolds, you created quite a stir. Some investors to see you. Ooh, those are nice. Bring them out in the kitchen. So the mango worked? I got some money to invest. Don't rush me. We didn't want to miss out. Is it a good investment? Ask Mr. Scraper, he thinks so. They've invested and the rest of the council. See, when you're a seller, people come and shove money in your pocket. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I reckon my dad was a seller. Yeah, I reckon you might be right. David, I don't want you to be a seller. Why not? Because I just couldn't bear to have another seller in my life. I'm gonna go out and play with the fish. And I don't want you hanging around with Mr. Reynolds, OK. OK? HARRY REYNOLDS Cec, you're truly a genius. Today was day one of the great Beachport bonanza. The town folk are begging to stuff money in my pocket and I'm graciously allowing it. It will be bigger than even you imagined. All I need is a few weeks and I'll be lying on a beach in Bali and you'll have enough money to live out your days, however short, in style. PS, you know, I'm starting to like this place, Cec. Beachport is beautiful. A lot of sand and money, but no dune ship. Morning, gentlemen. Harry. Morning. Was looking for you. We'd like to invest a little more. I don't have my receipt book. Oh, that's fine. See, Harry, they're shoving money in your pocket. They look like dogs in suits having a gang bang. That's disgusting. Where did you learn language like that? Just asked my mom about the Stock Exchange. That would be right. Harry! Harry we found it. We found the dune ship. All's fair, Harry. The press are gonna love this. Come on. The dune ship? I've got Harry. It's just an old tree. Can't you tell the difference between a tree and boat? Definitely a tree. Norm. Nearly, Norm, next time. Uh, do you blokes, uh, want your checks back? Uh-huh. You don't fool us, Reynolds. You made a deal, you stick with it. Right. You've read about it in the papers, you've seen it on TV. Now here it is, Beachport, home of the dune ship. Dune ship souvenirs you can find-- Come on, Harry. A real classic, Joe. Can't find these in Sydney anymore. Hey, listen. I've had three phone calls already this morning, said he managed selling beachfront properties. Yep, didn't I tell you? Mm-hmm. Mom, look. It's a classic, isn't it? See ya! Come on, Harry. It's coming to me, that's it. Here it comes, it's the king of spades. It is. It's the king of spades. All right, quiet. Now David-- David, there it is. I can see it now, it's the jack of diamonds. Yep. Now think of it. Think of the card and it is-- here it is. It's the six of spades. Bravo. Here's another one. I bet that I can push this glass through the handle of this jug. No way. I can do it. Who does this creep think he is? Who said you can't? Is that the best you can do? $20. Come on, Harry. OK. Here we go. Very delicate trick, hasn't been done by too many people. And I push that glass through the handle of this jug. Thank you very. One born everyday. Very good. Bloody head through the handle. OK, very good, very good. Sold a lot of sand today, Harry? Hey? David, it's time for bed. Good night, squirt. Good night. Hey, will I see you tomorrow? Yeah, if it's OK with your mom. We'll talk about it later. - Good night. - Night. See ya. I got a bottle in the kitchen, want a drink? Yeah, I'd love one. So the sleepy little Beachport is waking up at last. Why is that, Harry? I put it down to personal magnetism. Haven't I met you before, Harry? Well, I don't think so. No, maybe not. You're like my father, same type. Yeah, that's nice. What's he do? Well, he, uh, cheats on my mother. Here's a man, 58 years old, cheating on his wife? Stayer? Oh, no, just to cheat. And I swear it's not even the sex, it's the selling, clinching the deal. You're selling yourself to David as the perfect father. But you taking him fishing, you're teaching him to surf. Now just a minute, every kid should be able to fish and catch a line. What's the harm in that? He has enough problems without some stranger fooling with his emotions. Shit, his own father did enough of that. I hate to hear a woman use language like that. Look, Harry, be a nice man. We're happy enough as we are here in little Beachport where nothing ever happens. Leave David alone. Come on, Harry, I've got the bait. Let's go. No fishing today, mate. But you promised last night. Your mom said no. What? Maybe she thinks we spend too much time together. Oh, wait here. I don't believe you did that. Did what? You told Harry he couldn't go fishing with me. We've been having a great time together and you ruined it. I told you again and again to stay away from that man. Who else am I going to play with? You dragged me from the city down here away from my friends. Look, David, don't get-- Are your just angry at him 'cause he's like dad? That's not his fault. He knows what it's like not to have a dad. He knows. OK, Harry, let's go. What about your mom? It's all sorted out. What you do to change her mind? Talk real fast and don't take no for an answer. All right, Harry? You're the boss. Let's go. Yeah. OK, David, it's alphabet time. Backwards? Got to see how fast you can say like Z, Y X, and W, V, U,T, S, R, Q, P, and O, N, M, and L, K J, and I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A. Good, you're getting a little better. Yeah. Gordo does names backwards. You know, like David Maguire, that's Eriugam Divad. Henry Reynolds, that's Sdlo-- Sd-- Sdlonyer Yrrah. Sit on your ear? Thanks. And mom's-- Oh, this is a stupid game. Tell me about your dad. I hate my dad. You don't. I do. Look who's coming. So is this the outdoors? That's the sky, that's the sand. And all that wet stuff, that's the-- That's the ocean. I've heard about all this. I thought I'd like to share some of it with my son before he grows up. Bravo! - cricket. - Hurry, Harry, get it. Get a run. OK. Run! Harry, hurry! Get it! Oh, US one, Australia zip. Not for long. Don't kill the batter. OK. - Come on, Davey. Give me a good one. Good one. Come on. Get out of the way, I'm coming through. Hurry. Don't bother. Home run! - I got it. - No, I got it. Oh, crap. You all right? I'm fine. I'm great. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen. On the left, the magnificent dune ship is here. And on the right, the magnificent dune ship picture theatre. You like the movies, son? - Love it. Beautiful, that's for you. Yay. And here, in the center of the jewel, the dune ship itself. That is, if you find it. - We'll find it. - We'll find it. Yeah! And beyond, the world famous Carinya Guesthouse where many of you are staying, managed and staffed by-- - David Maguire! - Yeah! And owned by-- Julie Maguire! What's that? What that? You were just got. You know, Harry, I hope you do find the dune ship. Oh, Boomtown is busted, the rigs are all rusted. There's no lights on my Christmas tree. Well, I tried El Paso and I tried Amarillo, but I didn't find a drop of Texas tea. Well, they hit us when we're down, and we can't get up though we're trying with all of our powers. Now the bottle's run dry and I'm wondering why, flushed out and-- Last week, we had one bus. This week, four a day. Things are looking up, I say, gentlemen. - Uh-huh. - Hi. Morning. Invest in a theme park? Yes. No, you can't do that. Yes. I've just had a settlement in from my ex. I've got $30,000. Normally, I just buy David and me a toy each and I put the rest toward the mortgage. Yeah, well, I suggest you do just that. You're saying it's a bum investment? No, it's a great investment. Well, if it's such a great investment, why don't you want my money? Because-- Mhm, mhm, mhm, Harry, I want in. Here! I'm not gonna take this money. No way! I'm not gonna take it. Harry, everybody in town thinks that you're screwing the socks off me. But I'm not. I know that, Harry. I know that, but nobody else does. Now what are they gonna think if you won't take my money? Excuse me, Giles would like to talk with you. - Harry. - Giles, how are you? Harry Reynolds. Giles, that $20-- I've been meaning to get that back to you. Silly trick. You wouldn't believe the number of people that fall for that. Oh, Harry, we got a problem. Anything I can do to help, anything. We need to have a talk. - Yeah? What about, Giles? I got a business proposition for you. Oh, great, great. When I talk business, I like to be comfortable. Are you comfortable, Harry? You know, I like to negotiate from a position of power. OK, Billy! Billy. Now I've got a little proposition for you, Harry. Now I don't want you to feel pressured, but I hope you won't say no. I'm saying, yes, Giles. Sight unseen, handshake deal, yes. I'm glad you see it my way, Harry. You know, you're a lot smarter than you look. OK, Billy, shut if off! You see, Harry, a smooth life can be when you sit down and discuss things like reasonable people. I don't want to disrupt the flow Giles, but the dozer's coming this way. Where's the manual? Jesus. Do you see what I gotta bloody put up with? Will you quit playing with that bloody thing? I'm trying to take a meeting here! I told you that's only if the bastard says no! Turn it off! You bloody prick! What do you think you're doing? Uh. I'm saying yes, Giles. We all like a little laugh. Turn the bloody thing off! Uh, [inaudible]. I've an alter boy. I went to Holy Cross. Sister Mary Thomas gave me for cleaning the black board. You said you could drive it! You're gonna run over him. No, you said I could drive it. But he's no bloody good to us dead. please, please, God, fundamentally a decent human being. Please don't let them make me dead! See? Let's just back it up. Yeah. I've come into some money, Harry. Good. Yeah, a certain interest in the city of leasing my back paddocks, you know. It's a vertically integrated operation where they grow the crop and process it, and then merchandise it down to street level. I don't want to know what the crop is, Giles. Please don't tell me. I need to launder this money, Harry, so I want you to sell me 10 points in your dune ships scheme for $1,000. I know I'm in a weak negotiating position here, Giles, but 10 points is $100,000. I'll give you a 1,000 for the 10 points. You give me a receipt for a 1,000 to show the taxman, and then I'll make you a present of $99,000 that the taxman doesn't need to know about. Deal? Uh-huh. 1,000, 99,000. Oh, Harry, I took my 20 back. A gift, Harry, that both of us can now forget. Well, this is Billy. He'll be looking after you and the money. I mean, I don't want you leaving town here, do I, Harry? Dig him out, Billy. I mean, we can't leave a company director laying here on the sand dunes, now can we? I'll be seeing you, Harry. Bye. Hi, Billy. Be careful, hey. I admire the way you drive that bulldozer, Billy, like a real pro. Thanks, Harry. Giles likes it when I do a good job. Yeah, I bet. When I don't, he yells at me. What exactly is your job, Billy? Oh, I break people's arms and legs. It's a family business. Me mom got me the job. Good old mom. I like her. Oh. Very promising, hey, tiger? Mhm. Very promising. Mhm. [speaking japanese]. We'll fix that. Can I help you? I'm looking for a gentleman called Reynolds, Harry Reynolds. He's in his room. I'll see if he's available. Yep. Harry. Harry, some gentleman to see you. I'll talk to him later. I'm feeling a bit off color. That's funny, you seemed fine a while ago. It's all very sudden. Can I get you something? No, I think I'll just spend a bit of time in bed. I mustn't panic. Don't want to panic. Man to see you, Harry. Uh? Hello, Harry. You remember me? Dad, is that you? I did not take your wallet. Cut the crap, Harry. Bottom line, you're a thief. Now look, I deal with thieves in business all the time. Now this is very good, this scheme of yours. It's not a scam. Scheme, I said scheme. I think it's very good. You must go on with it. Oh, then maybe I could fit you in for a few thousand, 10 or 20 maybe. No, I'm not gonna give you any money. You want money, you gotta get it off of those suckers there. No, look, I can make my profits out of this my own way. Right. Look, for a start, you see this place here, this Carinya guesthouse? That'll go. Tourist hotel there, resort hotel. Over here, high rise condominiums. This fishing pier, this will become a marina. Fisherman will just have to piss off. A man who owns just 1% of the concrete that will pour in this place will be a millionaire. Now this is a good idea you've got here, Harry. Just keep it going, hey? You stay in this town, and you do your theme park, or I'll send you straight back to jail. Give me your trousers. What? Your trousers. My trousers? You've gotta be joking. Remember Harry, I wear the trousers. No visitors please. Harry. Julie. Can you shut the door? The drafts. You manage to eat something? Yeah, it was lovely. But still a bit hot. Mhm. Oh, no, no, no, it feels very good. Very good. Mhm, very good. I brought you this, Harry. Well, I'm glad you're feeling better. It's very kind of you, David. Oh, I think you're gonna die, Harry. Come on, drink up. Remember Harry, you gotta get better for the dance tomorrow night. I got troubles, you got troubles, all God's children got troubles. Living in bad water. Bad water trying to roll all over me. Harry, the dance, all the chicks are down there. Your investors, you gotta impress your investors. Oh, Harry, I can't handle them all on me own. All right, all right. Get outside and I'll get dressed. Yeah! Come on, Billy. What am I doing here? All right, mate, do your stuff. That's what you're here for. Smile for your customers, sell them. It's showtime. Hey, there, Giles. We've been prosperous tonight, fellow investors. - How are you, Harry? - I got too much to do. Goodnight, all. coming tonight? Hi, Billy. How are you? Who's this guy? So you city guys dance or what? Us city guys dance. You joking? Whoa. I like the way you walk. I like the way you talk. Which one of us is the prettiest? Let me hold you hand, try to understand. I want a girl like you, tell my troubles to you. Don't be afraid. You've heard what I said. Hey! Let the four wind blow. Whoa! Yeah. and make it happen. We'll make money, money, money, money, money, money. What are you gonna do with the money? Harry, I've come to invest. Aren't you gonna give your dear old, Uncle Cec a kiss? You nearly gave me a bloody heart attack. You deserve one, you thieving young mongrel. You stole my research, years of hard work. I thought you were gonna [inaudible].. Anyway, I never thought you'd see the outside again. Early release came, pal. What do you mean early release came? I'm rehabilitated. You? Yeah, I got three psychiatrists to say I'm rehabilitated. What, you got a pot from my money? Now how much have we got? You've been doing banks, Harry? 'Cause if you've been doing banks, that's the stone end. I'm finished with you. I have not been doing banks, honest. Drugs? Shut up, Cec! If you dealing drugs, that is the stone end of a family man. I'm not dealing in drugs. You're doing something illegal. Now look. There's 20, 30,000 in this damn top. Now what you got in here? 193, 000. A 109-- Shh! Be quiet. They're greedy. They just keep forcing it on me. We better get out of here. You've got a car? Of course, I got a car. Follow me. We got all the towels we need, thanks. Jeez. You distract King Kong and I'll take the money and we'll meet back in Sydney. Are you sure, Cec? All right. Later on, we both come back, have a few beers, have a bit of a chat, give it an hour and, psh, out the window. Harry, I can tolerate a lot, but don't tell me you're going moral on me. Time to leave, Harry. All right. Come on, Godzilla, I'll buy you a drink. Now it's your turn-- - You having fun? - Yeah. --to cry over me. You look terrific in your suit. Yeah, I like it too. Every road has a turning-- Why don't you go get something to drink? - OK. - Yeah? And that's one thing you're learning. I cried for you. Oh, what a fool I used to be. I suppose you'd like to dance with the big city guy. But I've found two eyes just a little bit bluer. I found a heart just a little bit truer. I like it here, Harry. I think I like it here better than any place I've ever been. I cried for you. My grandpa has got a suit just like yours. Yeah? Sharp dresser, is he? Yeah. Mom said he could sell refrigerators to Eskimos. Eskimos need refrigerators, kid, to keep their beer warm. Are you Japanese? Hi. Cec and me gonna sink a few cold ones. Come and join us, Billy. I can't. I'm on duty. Here, then take half of theirs, make your duty a little easier. You sure? Absolutely, for saving my life with that bulldozer. Well, thanks, Harry. One hour, another hour. Bloody woman! There's, of course, a man's downfall. They brought sin in the world. See you tomorrow, Cec. Look, I'm a family man, but I can't abide women. Oh, you know what, Harry? You'll regret it. Am I right, Billy? Billy's nodding his head, yes, Harry. Am I spoiling your plans for the evening? Slow down. We've got all the time in the world. No, I can talk to Cec any old time. Well, I bet he gets lonely. This is OK, isn't it? I mean, I get a little embarrassed with Billy out there. You're very strange, aren't you, Harry? It's not my fault I'm straight outta Holy Cross primary school. It's always a matter of trust, David. The whole world operates on trust. And the man who has confidence in you, a man who gives you his trust is-- A man to watch out for. Right, Cec? The kid's got a lot of talent, probably more than you had at that age. I was a pro at his age. Harry, don't lie to me. I happen to know your old man didn't go to jail until you were fully 13. Well, you stay away from the kid. Don't even corrupt him. Then we both gotta leave town. Here is your tea and milk, yeah. All right, but not until the night. I'm gonna say goodbye to the kid, and I'm giving Julie her money back. Here we go. Ow! Hey, what you doing? Knock your block off. What you reckon, Harry? You got a great surf here, mate. I only wish I could do this every day. You do realize, though, that I just can't solely spend the rest of my life swimming and fishing. I'm a businessman, and businessman have to take trips. Yeah, my dad used to take trips. And mine. You going away, Harry? Well, yeah. Well, I mean not-- I might have to go away for a trip some time and I don't want you sort of thinking that-- look, my dad went away a lot, and I turned out pretty good. Didn't I? Yeah, Harry. You turned out the best. So will you. I mean, a boy needs his mom and his friends when he's growing up. But sooner or later, he's gotta get out on his own, and then it's what's inside him that matters. And you're gonna be the very best. Hey! I got something for you. It sort of lights up, you know. I'm waiting! And a book. Harry! You better go and see that man. I'll see you at the blessing of the fleet night. Hop in. What do you want, Bostock? This local council's giving me the runaround. Every time I ask them for something, they say, Mr. Reynolds has it all tied up. What did you do to get this cockamamie five year option, hypnotize them? They practically forced it on me. It's all their idea. Well, in my eye, is that you forced yourself to help the man who could call your parole officer and tell him where you are and what you've been doing. This is a contract drawn up by my lawyers. It transfers to my company all the rights and permits that you've obtained from the local counsel. Well, I'll have to read it. Well, you do that, Harry. And I'll just call your parole officer. Do you have the telephone number? This is very unethical behavior. That's all right because I have the telephone number. Eight digits, wasn't it, Harry? The number four? It's ringing, Harry. Hello? Oh, could you just hold on a moment, please. I'm sorry, it was a wrong number. I'm getting to like this place. I don't want you destroying it. Well, conservationists, hey? It's kinda touching. It's so beautiful, so unspoiled. Might be unspoiled to you, Harry, but it's unused to me. I mean, what's the use of all this scenery if millions of people can't see it, and how much more beautiful when it turns a profit. Cement, Harry, it's the mother Earth to the developer. You're a snake, Bostock. Well, please, Harry. Flattering. God, I love this view of the guesthouse, don't you? Yeah. It could do with some paint, though. Maybe cream with a red trim? Oh, I don't know. I like it just the way it is. Looks great. Wish it could stay that way forever. It will. Oh, look, they're starting. God, our father, you created this-- Yep, the blue boat, that's the King Fisher. Wouldn't it be great to own a fishing boat, Harry? Cecil Arthur Heggarty, what a surprise. Sergeant. Sergeant Watts, isn't it? We haven't brought our checkbook and credit cards back to Beachport, have we, Cecil? No, Sergeant, just a holiday. Ah. And where are we staying, Cecil? He's staying at the guesthouse, Sarge. I wouldn't take any checks if I was you, Mrs. Maguire. The last time Cecil was here, what, uh, five years ago, he cashed a lot of checks. I had to send him away to Sydney for a holiday. Harry. That's discrimination, Sergeant. What you're doing is illegal under the anti-discrimination act. Oh, I'm a bad boy. Yeah, and your timing is atrocious, Sergeant. You were arrested here by passing paper and you came back? - I had to come back. You stole my research and I knew you'd be here. - What'd you think of it, Harry? - It was great. Great parade. Thanks. You couldn't have even done the scam. I had to check if Watts had moved on, get a partner in if he hadn't. You-- I was grooming you for it. You didn't even do the research, did you? It was all [inaudible],, wasn't it? You make these accusations. Wasn't it? All right, I'll tell you. He didn't know what he had. It was all bloody history to him. He couldn't see the potential. That's what I get for mixing with the criminal class. You've got no moral sense, no brains. Oh, you should talk, sleeping with a divorced woman. You leave me out of this. It's the morality I can't stand. - Harry, I want to talk. - Later, please. I want to talk now. David, you go do something in the kitchen. Uncle Cec-- tell me. Tell me now. Cec has had a bit of hard luck in his time and I'm just trying to help him. Please don't bullshit me, Harry. I used to get this from my husband. I can hear it. I can hear it by the way you're saying it. No, he's not your uncle. Tell me, where do you know him from? Come again? Where? Where, the YMCA, youth hostels, church choir? Long Bay jail. Oh, I am such a fool. I am such an idiot. Look, I wasn't gonna take your money. Oh, no, just everybody else's. Well, they forced it on me. They're greedy mongrels. You saw that. You saw them. They just came and they just stuffed it in your pocket. Look, Julie, I never thought-- Well, I have lunch to cook. In big business, Billy, nobody trusts you. I've always found-- Get straight off my bed. Oh, still touched, are we? You too, Billy. Come on, Billy, I'll buy you a beer, tell you about women. They may smell like roses, but that bouquet is one part rose, 11 parts carbon monoxide. I promised Giles I'd stay and watch the money. Harry won't let that money out of his sight. See, he even locked the door. Come on, let's go. All right, then. MAN Harry Joseph Reynolds, three convictions of false pretenses, partner associate of Cecil Arthur Heggarty. Make sure-- That's all I need. Back off, Giles. He's mine. So where is your partner, Cec? What partner? You stay-- Yeah, call him by his first name. I pay taxes. Hey, you let these cons out of jail and screw all our citizens. Now you watch your language. Aw, blow it out your nose, pop. Reynolds, you better have all my money or the next time I bury you it won't be in sand! Hey, hey, Brain Damage-- Please don't call me that, Giles. If you let that Reynolds bastard out of your sight, then I'm gonna rip your head off, huh? It's all right there, $94,000. I want your receipt books and I want you in the council hall at 7 o'clock tonight to talk to your investors. You got a warrant, Sarge? I've checked your record, Harry. You're on parole. You can go back inside just like that. Fine, I got nothing to hide. Sit down. dune ship research 20 years. Is it true you've been to jail? Please, please. Please give Harry a chance to say something. Why shouldn't he have another chance to speak? Harry, tell me-- tell us all the truth. The truth. Yes, please. Just tell us the truth. Truth is, I'm a conman-- --three months since I was born, turned pro at seven. I've taken a lot of people's money. I've had three convictions. No. No! David. No, Harry, you're a liar! Liar, liar! Listen, he's told us himself he's a conman. I don't think we need to waste a lot of time on Harry Reynolds. I mean, Harry's of no account. But the interesting thing about Harry Reynolds is the great idea he bought to Beachport. The dune ship theme park will put Beachport on the map. So Harry, thank you and goodbye. Now get these nice people back their money, and get on your bike. Now just a minute. I'm a conman, I admit it. But I'm small time compared to him. If he has his way, he'll change this town so you'll never recognize it again. You're bullshit, your dune ship's bullshit. Not bullshit, Giles. A myth, a thing to live by. A dream to take us all through. And look at what's been going on in this town in the last month. This place came around, there's cars in the street. People from out of town are spending money here. Real estate, your real estate and your real estate, it's starting to move. People are pulling money out of mattresses. This ghost town is coming alive again. This town's on its way now. You don't need me, you don't need him. You don't need anybody but yourselves. I found something here that I could only imagine before, but I don't deserve this place. Just don't sell this town to the bastards of the world. They'll destroy it. Words, just pretty words. What I am offering you is real. My references are governors, bank presidents, merchants with full wallets. What are your references, Harry? The warden at Long Bay prison? Look, Harry. Take a look. I found the dune ship! I found it! The dune ship, I found it, Harry! I found it! The dune ship-- the dune ship, I found it, Harry. What? The dune ship, I saw it! The dune ship-- Shut up! The dune ship's there, I saw it. Where? Stamper Point. It's really there. The storm blew all the sand away. It's there. I knew it. Stamper Point, just like I've always said. It's the moon and the tides. Oh, I knew it. Come on, Harry. We always knew it'd be there. Didn't we, Harry? They came halfway around the world in that little ship, almost like going to another planet. As-- as you'll notice up here, you'll see by the geological location and [inaudible],, this would have to be the-- the most important wreck found in the world. I mean, it's an enormous significance to, uh, to international or ecological studies. It's-- it's-- it's infinitely precious. I mean, this would have to be the Tutankhamun's tomb of the South sea. Harry, we can make a fortune out of this. Let's stick around and see what happens. We delivered. Look, let them calm down. They'll be grateful, and we can-- Listen. The ship was a fluke, Cec. We're con artists. That's our job, isn't it? Conning people. I think that's yours, Mrs. Maguire. Thanks, Sarge. Mr. Giles. $1,000, as per receipt. Is that it? I mean, there isn't any more? The last of the big spenders, hey, Giles? No. No, that'll be more than enough to pay for the funeral. Harry, you're just gonna leave without saying goodbye? I was gonna get around to it. I don't want you to go without knowing there's a place for you here if you want it. Do you reckon? Yes, I reckon. Look at this town, Harry, you breathed life into it. You let something loose here. Can't you stay and see it through? You're better than you think you are, Harry. That'll be right. You'll be wanting some money? I'll be wanting 99 grand. Giles, I'm about to put in a counter offer. I've had some expenses. I want you to listen before you react, 50 grand. 50? 50! You jail birds, you crawl out of your sewers like slime rats. You come down here wearing suits. You're cheating us honest farmers. We gotta work for a living. Break his bloody arm, Billy. All right, Giles. Harry. I hate to do this, but Harry and Cec are me mates. Your mates? You moron. You bloody imbecile. You cretinous dead shit! I can't stand bad language. 50, Giles, 50. Yes, severe penalty for early withdrawal. Best offer you'll get all day. Harry. Don't think revenge, think of two words, income tax. Count on me for a reference, Billy. Let that be a lesson. Here, let me help you, Giles. Just piss off. Well, you can't keep being rude to people, Giles. Just stop! Is it OK if I quit, Giles? I think you're sick. Good for you, Billy. Now where's the money, you thieving young bastard? I know it's here somewhere. There's 40 here. You got it on you, haven't you? All right, stop the car. It's a strip search. Get your bloody clothes off. Right on time, Harry. Here you go, Harry. Thanks, mate. The black fish are running. Harry, you don't want a woman and a kid around your neck. I had some once and it interfered with my career moves. On the other hand, we-- we could take the kid with us. Harry, what a team the three of us would make. We can work the airline terminals and he could tell the old ladies he's lost his ticket. You'd like that, wouldn't you kid? Can I come, Harry? Can I? You are a moral defective, Cec. That's a horrible thing to say. Davey, listen to me. Here, this will get you to Melbourne in style. No, Cec, you gotta go to Sydney. Ah, take it all, you deserve it. It was a great scam. Get on, mate. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. It's past now, Harry. Maybe, I wouldn't bet on it. See you, Cec. Come on, square. How do you reckon it'll go, Davey? Oh, she'll be all right, mate. Tell him to get off his ass. Look, we're paying him an arm and a leg, so I tell him to get off his backside, hey. Ah, could-- could we just have a word with you, Mr. Bostock. Just a minute. Uh, what you were saying last night about, uh, Reynolds having a good idea-- Well, now we have our money back. What we thought-- We thought of getting a similar scheme off the ground. So we'd like to invest with you. Well, look, there will be a dune ship theme park, gentlemen, but, uh, we won't be having a local investment. What? We're offering you money. I've got money. Now it's-- look, it's-- it's our dune ship. No, it's not. It's my dune ship. You gave Harry Reynolds full development rights. Well, he sold them to me. He sold them? Harry did that? Hey, he made a handsome profit too, hey. And believe me, gentlemen, it's all legal. It's just like Reynolds to stab you in the back. Are you still there? Yeah, right. Look, I want the engineer over here too because I want to get this road underneath the other-- There is Harry. I'll handle this. What are you doing back, Reynolds? You forget something? Yeah, I came back to stop you ruining our town. You get in my way and I'll see you back in jail. And you wouldn't like that, would you, Harry? To save this town, try me. Ah, Harry, he said you sold him all the right. Now why did you do that, Harry? Oh, I don't remember selling him anything, Norm. Once a liar, always a liar. Let me refresh your memory, Harry. He signed all his rights over to me. Now what we have here is a completely legal document. Harry. Hello. Who, Bostock. Yeah, there was somebody by that name, but he had to leave town quite suddenly. Didn't he? Council meeting in half an hour, fellows. David! Mom! How you reckon it'll go, Harry? Well, she'll be all right, mate. Oh, my hand shakes steady and my words are sweet, and the whole world's lying here at my feet. Put your trust in me, put your trust in me. I rub my eyes and I catch my breath. I'm almost choking on the smell of success. Put your trust in me, put your trust in me. I get careless now and then, but I won't let you down again. I got x-ray eyes. And with just one look, I can read your future like an open book. Put your trust in me, Put your trust in me. I get careless now and then, but I won't let you down again. Oh, my hand shakes steady and my words are sweet, and the whole world's lying here at my feet. Put your trust in me, put your trust in me.
