I died?Technically speaking, yes. You had an N.D.E. - I don't know what that is.- Near-death experience. It's my field of expertise.That's why I fought to make surethat you were my patient. Let me guess now. You saw a blinding white light that engulfed you, almost seemed to be beckoning you to stay. Yeah, that's exac-- That's--How did you know that? Well, the research I've done finds that as many... as eight out of 10 people who've had an N.D.E. report seeing a white light. - It's freaky, huh? - What about the light I'm seeing right now? It's probably just an aura-- - a type of residue, if you will. - That's normal? I'd say we're well beyond the bounds of normal here, but yes.

I'm-- I'm seeing and hearingall kinds of electrical stuff. E.V.P. stands for Electronic Voice Phenomenon. Precognition,the white lightyou're seeing-- all that stuff is partof the supernaturalwhite noise that surrounds us. I've got a grant to study theseparanormal types of things. -So, E.V.P.-- What exactly is it?-It's the recording of voices... and images of the deceasedusing a detuned receivingapparatus, like a TV or radio. Others think it's nothing morethan a charge from ourelectromagnetic fields. And still others believe it'sa means through which the deadcan communicate with the living.
