And there was dawn, Mavutsinim created the world. The clouds drew messages, and the night became day. Mavutsinim said that the beings would be eternal. Created the man and the woman. Said that the fishes would sprout from the rocks and would become water, and rivers, rapids. Would become sea, wind, storm, air. And twelve moons would pass, and Mavutsinim determined that his son would come back to the promised land where the men are eternal, and hence the history of the world. LIGHT IN THE TROPICS There's not much firewood. The weather is dry, the earth is thirsty. The harvest will be smaller this year. We wake up early in the village. Then, after bathing, we eat manioc and fish, and go to harvest the manioc. Our days are like this, even on a full moon. It's almost ready. It's going to be good. Look. This is how we work, we light the fire with this. Atuginha. -Atuginha? -Yes. Try it. Yes, to fan the flames and keep it alive. -Atuginha. -That's right. Is it true? I like it, you're learning. These are our everyday things. Here we make beiju. -Tuahi. -What? Yes. And this is angagi, where we put the food and it gets hot. Exactly. That there, pass it to me. -It's really very good. -You're remembering... -Angari. -Angari? Angari. Say it with me. Repeat... Udagi, udagi. U-da-gi. Look at the stools we're sitting on. Kadoho. Kadoho. Yes. Want more? Finished? Is it good? Stay with us. And this, do you remember the name? Do you know the name of this? Do I know? Kanagitahu. Nagitahu. Wrong. Wrong, I understand. You'll remember. Water? Back there. Yes. Look there in that pot. This is porridge, drink it. Porridge. -Very good. -That's good. -Lisinh? hegei itit?. -What? Delicious. Yes, this is really good. It's made from manioc flour. I liked it. What are you doing? I'm cutting a little more. It's looking good. Almost done. Just here where it's longer. Done. Just this last lock. I'm going to take the hair off your face. Now you're going to look beautiful. What are we going to do? We're really happy to have you here with us. -I also feel welcomed. -That's good. I came here so that we could talk. Let's talk. -I have few memories. -I know. I came from so far, a cold and chaotic land. You came from very far. Listen to my grandfather's words. I want to hear. Your eyes are my eyes. Your mouth is my mouth. My shadow is in your shadow. Your words are mine. I liked the message. Me too. Many memories. It's hot. Very hot. Yes. Let's do the patterns here. Ok. So we can celebrate. We're almost done. You're looking very beautiful. -Very good. -Yes, you're very beautiful. You'll look beautiful with urucum. -Very good. -Really good. Embellish and sing. Just this part at the back. Life took me under its wing to keep me and save me. And it's true I avoided the shipwreck, yet I want more. Without burnt leaves, without broken branches, a day as clean as glass, yet I want more. Now that summer's gone... The journey remains in my mind like a confused nightmare. The passengers were preoccupied neither with our position, nor with the route we had to follow, nor with the nature of the countries which lay out of sight behind the horizon. For a number of days that had been decided in advance, it was not because a distance had to be covered, but because they had to expiate the privilege of being carried from one side of the world to the other without making, themselves, the smallest exertion. I'm passionate and full of desires. Full of... I'm a lover, lover... I'm like a lover. The last... I'm passionate and full of hope. For... For the last smile. For the first smile. And that's how I was brought up as an athlete. And that's how I was brought up as an athlete. (The first smile of a beauty) In all this splendour gnawing at my feet in vain. Naked, strong, forehead plunged into the mist. Shrouded in the mist, the wind, and in the night that intertwine. I raise my arms towards the dark ether. In my opinion, there are various interrelated questions. Therefore, the question I ask myself today, that I wish to speak of now, is the following... The first point is an apparent contradiction... Understand? Apparent! Between Hyppolite's thought that "there is no error in philosophy", and Canguilhem's proposition, "there is no philosophical truth". In fact, Hyppolite's proposition was interpreted by some as "the philosopher never errs". I don't believe it was exactly this that he wished to say. The second question is regarding Canguilhem's elucidation. And the third question, that for me underlies the others, relates to the philosophical enterprise. What does it mean to philosophize? These questions are related. I don't think they can be separated, don't you think? What do you think? Your explanation is agreeable. In what sense? In the sense of... the stars. Apparently philosophy does not interest you. He comes. Silently. Doubtless he needs something. He looks at us. All we could find on the river's edge were four or five deserted huts. Not a soul to be seen. And a rapid inspection satisfied us that the hamlet had been abandoned. Our nerves were in shreds after the efforts of the previous few days, we felt near to despair. Should we give the whole thing up? We decided to make a last effort before turning back, each of us would start off in a different direction and explore the outskirts. In the afternoon, everyone returned discouraged. They'd gone soft: he-abed mornings, to begin with, and indolent meals which had long ceased to be a pleasure and were now merely a device (and one that had to be made to last as long as possible) for getting through the day. Don't ask me who I am Because I won't say that I only know that where I am going Love will go with me And with courage I have changed my luck Today I'm going towards life Today I'm going towards life Before I was going towards death When I asked for justice They did not give it to me When I wanted to love Nobody loved me When I formed a nest In betrayal, they burned it When I prayed to Christ My prayers were not answered Don't ask me who I am Because I won't say that I only know that where I am going Love will go with me And with courage I have changed my luck Today I'm going... Towards life Today I'm going towards life Before I was going Towards death The Pleiades can be seen by the naked eye. I once counted 14 stars going out in a single night. They are brighter stars. And they are among the objects of the deep sky known of since the distant past. Look. The nebulae of the Pleiades are blue. Nebulae of reflection, that reflect the light from the closest stars. The world began without man. And will end without him. Light in the tropics. What impedes man from attaining happiness is not his nature, but the artifices of civilization. I shall have occasion to describe trips that I remember better than the one in question. I shall therefore say only that it took us eight days to work our way upstream, the river being swollen by the rains. Once, when we were lunching on a little sandbank, we heard the rustling movement... of a boa, seven yards long, that we had awakened with our talk. It took a lot of lead to kill it, for the boa cares nothing for body-wounds. The head alone is vulnerable. When we came to skin it, took us half a day, we found a dozen little boas already alive and on the point of being born; the sun killed them off. Ow! Fuck! To left and right were clumps of shrubs spaced out as if in an orchard. At a distance they formed into dark masses, while the sky, reflected in the water, projected here and there its own likeness beneath the branches. Everything seemed to be simmering at a low heat, it was a stew that would take a long time to mature. If it was possible to linger for thousands of years in this prehistoric landscape and to follow its evolution closely, we should, no doubt, witness the transformation of organic matter into peat, or coal, or petrol. I even thought that I saw some petrol rising to the surface, staining the water with its delicate iridescence. And in the beginning God created the sky And in the beginning God created the Earth Yet the Earth was chaos And darkness dominated all Then God's finger made light Then God's finger made man Then God's finger made the one who seduces And the world grew? And the world grew Everything changed and someone asked Did God change? Or did we change our god? Did God change? Or did we change our god? Might the one who created the sky Be the one who'll destroy Earth? Might the one who created light (from shadow) Be the one who'll destroy Earth (with the bomb)? Because for the bomb to explode Someone has to press the button Might it be man? Might it be woman? Might they press the button whenever they wish? What will the finger be like of the one who presses the button? What will the finger be like of the one who presses the... Listen... to the sound of nature. Listen... the noise of nature. Listen to it. The noises of nature. Did you sleep well? Not at all. Did you sleep well, sir? Not at all. Not at all. It's not tiredness. I don't feel tired. Despite the oppressive heat. I feel like a harnessed horse. Thank you. Do you wish to leave? Or to stay here? It's not that I want to stay here either. I had heard... I must have heard tell of the view, the distant sea, in the background, in hammered lead. The so-called golden vale so often sung. The double valleys, the glacial loughs, the city in its haze. It was all on every tongue. Anyway... who are these people? Who are you all? Did they follow me up here? Came before me, came with me? The sound of nature. The sound of nature. I'm down in the hole the centuries have dug. Celtic beliefs that the souls of those whom we have lost... In an animal, in a vegetable, in an inanimate thing... In an animal, in a vegetable, in an inanimate thing and so effectively lost to us. Which, to many never comes, when we happen to pass by the tree and obtain possession of the object which forms their prison. And obtain possession of the object which forms... In an inferior being, in an animal, in a vegetable, in an inanimate thing. In an inferior being, in an animal, in a vegetable, in an inanimate thing. And in the midst of the storm, he reaches God. Don't ask me who I am Because I won't say that I only know that where I am going Love will go with me And with courage I have changed my luck Today I'm going towards life Today I'm going towards life Before I was going towards death Then a man appeared during that night and he talked about the Sun, and the Sun appeared. Talked about the Moon, and the Moon appeared. And then the Earth. And made the water with the fish that everyone eats, did the forests and filled it with animals to hunt. So he got the clay and made a boy. And when he grew up, while that child was asleep, he took away two ribs and made a girl. Your eyes are my eyes. Your mouth is my mouth. My shadow is in your shadow. Your words are mine. When he woke up, he saw the girl next to him and said: "Look, there's a girl here." And then the son of God said: "This girl is for you to raise, but don't mess with her." But the boy liked the girl, and they fell in love. Could play with the clay and create living beings. And the girl created animals, plants and asteroids, and whatever she thought of, happened. And so the days went by until the last living beings of Earth were extinguished. Only Indians, black, poor, sick, children and the old were left. And the living beings would have to learn everything again or else only air and wind would be left, and some shooting stars. And that's how I was brought up as an athlete. Love... in all its greatness. Total love in time. Naked, strong, forehead plunged into the mist... Love... Profane love... Shrouded in the mist, the wind, and in the night that intertwine. I raise my arms towards the dark ether. Daybreak is a prelude, and nightfall an overture, but an overture which comes at the end, and not at the beginning. The look of the sun foretells what the next hours will bring, dark and livid, that is to say, if we are in for a wet morning, and pink, frothy, and insubstantial. But as to the rest of the day, the dawn makes no promises. It simply sets the meteorological stage and adds a direction: it will rain or it will be good weather. The sunset, on the other hand, is a complete performance with a beginning, middle, and end. A synopsis of all that has happened - fighting, triumphs and defeats - during the previous 12 hours tangibly, but very slowly. Dawn is simply the day's beginning. Sunset, the day run through again. That is why people pay more attention to sunset than to sunrise. Dawn merely adds a footnote to what they have already learnt from barometer and thermometer or, in the case of the less civilized, from the phases of the moon, the flight of birds, and the oscillations of the tide. Remembrance is a source of profound pleasure, though not to the extent that it is complete, for few would wish to live over again, literally, sufferings and exhaustions which are, nonetheless, a pleasure to look back upon. Remembrance is life itself, but it has another quality. And so it is that when the sun lowers itself towards the polished surface of a flat calm at sea like a coin thrown down by a miser in the heavens, or when its disc outlines the mountain-tops like a metal sheet at once hard and lacy, then man has a brief vision, a hallucination, a brief vision, a hallucination, one might say, of the indecipherable forces, the vapours and fulgurations whose obscure conflicts he has glimpsed vaguely, within the depths of himself, from time to time during the day. These inner spiritual struggles must have been sinister indeed, for the day had not been marked by any outward event that might have justified an atmospheric upheaval. It had, indeed, been featureless. Around four in the afternoon, just at that moment when the sun is half-way through and is becoming less distinct, though not, as yet, less brilliant, and the thick golden light pours down as if to mask certain preliminaries. A light swell had set her rolling. Nobody had paid any attention to it, for nothing is so much like a transfer in geometry as a passage on the high seas. There is no landscape to point up the transition from one latitude to the next, or the crossing of an isotherm or a pluviometric curve. Thirty miles on dry land can make us feel that we have changed planets. But, to the inexperienced eye, each of the three thousand miles at sea is much like the last. To the scholars, dawn and twilight are one and the same phenomenon. And the Greeks thought the same, since they used the same word for both, qualifying it differently according to whether morning or evening was in question. This confusion is an excellent illustration of our tendency to put theory first and take no account of the practical aspect of the matter. Between the zone of incidence of the sun's rays and the zone in which the light vanishes or returns, it is perfectly possible. No two things could be more different than morning and evening. Daybreak is a prelude, and nightfall an overture, but an overture which comes at the end, and not, as in most operas, at the beginning. The look of the sun foretells what the next hours will bring, dark and livid, that's to say, if we are in for a wet morning, and pink, frothy, and insubstantial if the weather is to be fine. But as to the rest of the day, the dawn makes no promises. It simply sets the meteorological stage, and adds a direction: it will rain or it will be good weather. The sunset, on the other hand, is a complete performance with a beginning, middle, and end. It will rain or it will be good weather. The sunset, on the other hand, is a complete performance with a beginning, middle, and end.

That is why people pay more attention to sunset than to sunrise. Dawn merely adds a footnote to what they have already learnt from barometer and thermometer or, in the case of the less civilized, from the phases of the moon, the flight of birds, and the oscillations of the tide. And the oscillations of the tide. Whereas a sunset reunites within its mysterious configurations the twists and turns of wind and rain, heat and cold. And the oscillations of the tide. Whereas a sunset reunites within its mysterious configurations the twists and turns of wind and rain, heat and cold, to which their physical being has been exposed. And in the night that intertwine. Shrouded in the mist, the wind and in the night that intertwine. I raise my arms towards the dark ether.
