He sat there for 2176 days staring into the wall. - Are you Hansen? - Yes. Terje Hansen, CID. It's crucial this doesn't get out. You've been responsible the five years he's been here. What can you tell us? He didn't like being locked up. Got very aggressive around Christmas. - Was he violent? - He attacked the staff. Did he have any interests, routines, anything that he enjoyed? Porridge. It was the only thing he would eat. - Porridge? - Clich√©? - I don't envy you. - What do you mean? You'll have to get in his head. ALTA AIRPORT - Who the hell would live here? - I like it here. - It is so fucking cold! - Why didn't you bring any warm clothes? - Want a lolly, little girl? - Annika, you fucking bogan! How's my cake? Man, I'm buggered. I can never sleep on those freakin' planes. Tell that to Miss Dreamy, who groaned from Oslo to Alta. Give it a rest! - She had an orgasm the whole way. - I didn't! Hard work sitting next to her. - Should we tell her? - Tell me what? In the butt. Come on. I'm too tired for this shit. Just tell me already. We're going on a bus for four hours. Fuck! - Is it this dark all the time? - Yes, it's dark all day now. Far out! Are you still surfing? It's really busy. All these hot, Scandi boys coming for winter. A good reason to scrub up on my Norwegian. Yeah! "I eat eggs! Very good!" No. Ritika. It's important that we give Julie a lot of support. - What happened? - She didn't say. Her mother struggled. - She hanged herself in the shower. - In the house where we're staying? Yes, but let's not talk about it. I don't want to live with ghosts. As you probably know psychopathy consists- - of a mixture of narcissistic, anti-social and... ...emotionally unstable characteristics. A psychopath is not capable of feeling remorse, empathy or sympathy for others. A psychopath will be able to read his victims' emotions until he turns this to his own advantage. They are run by impulses. You could say that all notorious serial killers were psychopaths. Within our current diagnostic system- - I would say that he suffers from a dysfunctional personality disorder. However, it isn't quite accurate. - So, what is he? - Through my years as a psychiatrist I have been taught that people like him do not exist. He should not exist. He's the manifestation of pure evil. Terje... You haven't been sleeping well lately, have you? - Just a bit of Christmas stress. - Well... This is very unusual, and I very rarely do this, but... This is Stilnoct. There are two pills in this jar. Two pills should do the job. How nice! We'd better get there soon or I'm taking a bed in this hotel. The GPS thinks it's here. Maybe you should just call her. Can you see any street names? Boo! I can't believe you're all here! Oh my God, it's so good to see you. Hey Julia, turn on your phone once in a while. Never! Thank you. It's warm. I don't want a drink. I'm too tired. Seriously? We should celebrate. It's been six years since we were together. I really miss Sydney. CHRISTMAS BLOOD -Forensics. - Have you been through the list? 84 names on the list were victims last year. 14 are still alive, and two died while he was in custody. -One was called Britt Elin Buljo. - What did she die of? -She killed herself. - Suicide? Lucky bastard. The other person is Tore Reks, who died in a road traffic accident. Okay... - When did they die? -Let's see... He died in 2012. She died two weeks ago. Let's check their addresses. Okay. You'll hear from us. Can you get me a Mack ol? - Mack-ol. - Does anyone want anything? - No. - Boring, boring, boring. - Do you want to play cards? - Yes. Idiot? No. Poker. Aw! Mum knows best. You fucking cunt! I thought I was going to die! Fucking hell! I nearly had kittens! - I said the mask would frighten them. - Elisabeth! I didn't think you could make it! I've missed you! - Good night. - Night night. I forgot to brush my teeth. OSLO 24 DECEMBER 2003 Do you have to be so fucking noisy when you eat? - What's in the bag? - A present. Have you got a fuck friend? I hope it's more than that. A special man? Calling all units. Any patrols near Sankthanshaugen? We'll have to take it. This is 231. We'll deal with it. A woman has reported noise in the flat above hers. She saw a man wearing a Santa costume near the lift. He was banging his head against the wall. The woman seemed hysterical. - Okay? - It seems calm. - I'll check it out. - I'll report in. Enjoy your crisps. This is 231. Jostein? Jostein! Jostein? Shit! Shit! Bloody hell! This is 231. Man down! Help me! Come in, 231. Over. HONNINGSVAG 23 DECEMBER 2016 - Is Ritika still asleep? - Ritika can sleep for days. She always overslept when at school. What the hell?! - Who? - Not mine, mate. - Is it Ritika? - Don't look at me. Hey! Was it you? I feel a bit singled out when you attack me like this. - Is it because I'm black? - Don't! Answer me. Ask the white ones. Not again! I mean it. - Bloody bimbo. - It's because you're Swedish. A good morning. I need a cig. - A little hashish? - Goody Two-Shoes! Check who's here! Katja? Hi! Finally! - So good to see you! - And you. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Have you been crying? - No. Everything is hunky dory. - Hi. Julia. - Christian. - Have you eaten? - No. - It's ready. - Hi! Hi, Ritika. Hey. - How do you know her? - I filmed a music video she was in. And then we met at Lorry's. It's cruel. He's been thorough. You'd better get some sleep. - Hansen. -This is control. Just to let you know that the media has heard that the case is opened. Did you find anything? The house is empty, but I have heard that her daughter is there. -We haven't spoken to her yet. - What about Tore Reks? Will you give me a bag? - Are you okay? - Bloody hell! He's such an ass. On Facebook all the time, clicking on... I'm sorry. You're the one who's having a hard time. Julia... - Move! - Couldn't you just be like...? Are there any more bags? Do you know the cause of death? Yes, it is probably caused by a blunt object to the spine. Aorta has been severed. She died from circulatory shock. She bled to death, to put it bluntly. The bullet that penetrated the thorax has completely crushed the bone. See here. So this is... This is gunshot wounds? The entrance wounds from two of the bullets are medial to the shoulder. It was the fall that caused her death. Due to the degree of rigor mortis, and her body temperature... I can safely say... almost safely say- - that this women died yesterday between 19:00 and 20:00. I think... I think this is the wrong case. I'll send someone else. - Yes? -Was it Santa? - No, he wasn't involved in this one. -Okay. I'll be back in an hour. By the way, have you found anything on Rasch? No, but his post is delivered to an address registered to a woman. Okay. Yes, yes. - Fuck. There are some hunks here. - Are you on Tinder? Oh my God. We've exhausted our matches. Why did your mum kill herself? Ritika... I'm just curious. I didn't mean it like that. - She ran over a child. - Did the child die? You probably remember the last year at school. I was traveling back and forth... Mum got cancer. - She started drinking. - Was she drunk when she hit the kid? I never recognized her after that. - Is that why you left Australia? - Why didn't you say anything? Let's talk about something else. Well? Did the child die? I didn't think Thomas Rasch would have Christmas decorations. Who the hell are you? Terje Hansen, CID. Have you had a tough day? You weren't easy to find. Your flat is in some lady's name. Solveig. The best woman I have ever met. Many people in the office have huge respect for your work. You're a hero to many. I've got your job. Come and sit down. I want to show you something. - Hey! Take it easy! - Easy? He didn't die when you shot him. He's been in Ila Prison since 2009. - What the hell are you talking about? - "Christmas Blood". He escaped two days ago. It's Christmas Eve in two hours. You know what that means. - How did you get him? - It was a coincidence. You hunted him for 13 years over the whole country. You have to help me. I think you'd better leave now. You're tripping. Don't you see that I need you? Fat makeup, Birgitte. He fucks anything that can walk. - That's still just one. - I'm having a beer. - Does anyone else want one? - Who else? - You're not innocent, Rikita. - What are you talking about? What's going on? Am I the only one who doesn't know? What? Did you fuck Christian? - My Christian? - It was before you got together. You're unbelievable! Did you fuck that whore? - Is she okay? - She's not feeling great. I'll go and see her. - Don't be horrible to her. - No! Right! Calm down a bit, Julia. You're acting a bit psycho. Hey look! It's midnight. Good motherfucking Yule, bitches! SANTA CLAUS It's time. Yes! Hello! Okay. I see. Fine. Bye. Fuck! Fucking Santa fucker! Cunt! - What's the matter? - Sorry. I'm just so bloody fed up. - Maybe you should get some sleep. - Why does everyone talk about sleep? It's Christmas Eve. I can't sleep now. - What? - You remind me of someone. Don't even say it. Thomas Rasch used the same words. You should see him now. - I know. I saw him today. - How is he? Apart from the alcohol and the shotgun to my head it was fucking great. I'm going to bed. Okay. It was just an overdose. You see how cruel the world is at Christmas. I'll check if forensics have the addresses of the deceased. GOOD/NAUGHTY BOYS -GIRLS Where are you? He'll let you know soon enough. Are you sober? How did you manage to sit and wait? - Can't sleep at night? - They've made a mistake. Hi, Thomas! I haven't seen you for ages! - What mistake? - You've got a long beard. What mistake? The guy they registered as dead... It was a mistake. Tore Reks is alive. - In Oslo? - I'll go with you. Out of the question. Are you stealing from mummy's cupboard again? Come on! - You're paying your respect. - Fuck off! You are wicked. You heard her. Who's the whore? I'd be pretty pissed off if my boyfriend shagged my friend. Oh yeah boy yeah! Feels good, mate! Would you rather go down on your grandma or punch a baby in the face? Fuck me good! What's the matter? Get that chocolate gelati ass out of my face or I'll fucking bite it! Want a lick? You're as wild as I remember. Do you miss Katja now? Look here! Police! We have been trying to get hold of you all day. You dick! Are you fucking my friend while I'm upstairs? No, no... You bastard! Lie down! Ouch! Fuck! Calm down! Get away! Calm down! - What's happening? - He's fucking the whore in front of me! - Don't call me a whore! - What? Oh, I'm so sorry! My dear friend, what was it like to fuck my boyfriend? - Do you really want to know? - I'm sorry, Katja. - There was something in the cigarette. - The cigarette? Bloody hell! Hey, you! You're out! You were warned! You don't bring dope into my mum's house! You can't just throw me out in the middle of the night! - At least give me the car keys. - Just go! You're not serious! - We can't leave them outside all night. - He's not coming in! False alarm. - Sorry, you're on your phone? - Phone? - What's happened? - I walked into a door. Okay. We need to get hold of Julia Buljo. Santa doesn't know her mum is dead. Are you cold? You'll freeze to death. I'll be all right. Um... How cold is it, did you say? It was minus 32 degrees Celsius. Thanks! There is a hotel over there. Let's go there. - What a fucking cunt! - They will calm down by tomorrow. - I don't care. - I think your weed is still working. - In case they come back. - They are not coming in! She's right. Ritika is the strongest of us all. She's managed on her own all her life. Isn't it incredible that there is no one here? Listen! Hello! Just the two of us wandering about in some kind of ghost town. - Any more of that week? - No. - Your girlfriend is probably smoking it. - I understand her. Considering what the day has been like. I can't even mention it. Shh! Shh! Did you hear that? - It's probably just cows. - There are no cows here! Reindeer? Look, Ritika! It's just Father Christmas! In the middle of the night? Are you stupid? You're just an idiot. Yes, an idiot. Fuck it. - Wait! - How far do we have to walk? I think we have to go up there, and then around the corner... Ritika! Ritika? Ritika? - You're happy? - Yes. Why shouldn't I be? - Have you spoken to Christian? - His mobile is upstairs. - I'm sure he's okay. - It's Christmas Eve! Let them regret it. Something smells fucking awesome! Well, well, well! Who's this? - Still alive? - I was about to ask you. - Give me an update. - There's not much to say. We have a patrol at every address. Oh, yes! We have a Julia Buljo. Can't get hold of her. - She's not answering her phone. - She's Sami. - Where are we? - We are far north. In Honningsv√•g. Mageroya. - The police there have been informed. - So we will be too? - We're talking minutes. - Bloody hell, I have to puke. Okay ladies, it's about time we kicked off proceedings with a little bit of a trip down memory lane. Here. Oh yes! Do you remember when we had this in Australia? - Yes! - Okay, one. For old times. Come on. Okay. We have come here after such a long time for Julia. Ready? One, two, three, cheers! Ohh, yes! Oh that's good. Come on. Drink up. Go, go! This is a breaking news story: We've heard that the serial ki... Why so serious? - Shit! It's just massive! - Man, you are like Master Chef. Hey! Guess what? I just got a message from a Tinder guy who says he's coming over. Hi. It's Gunnar. It's completely dead. No. I'm freezing my dick off here! I'll come back to the station. There's Ritika, Annika, Elisabeth and Sanne. They are not answering. We sent a patrol there, but they said the house looks dead. Now they don't reply either. What are you doing? Don't you see? Don't you see it? It's a Christmas tree! A Christmas tree! And here's the star. It's a bloody Christmas tree. Can't you see? Can't you see the star? Come on. Come on! Come! Yuck! All that bacteria! The liquor will clean it. Look here. If you can just see the coin, it's perfect. - Quite some pictures you put on Tinder. - We had to liven up Christmas a bit. Doesn't your brother speak? He just needs a bit more moonshine. Sign language is quite sexy. Not if you know what it means. She's happy she's not from here. You need to drink as much as possible in one sip. She'll soon be a native. And you. He's there. How can you be so certain? Now, I've never... - Let go of that in your hand! - Dick! Look what you made me do! - Keep your dick in place. - Not easy with those babes. - Will you be getting your leg over? - I don't think they're very willing. Of course they are! I can promise you we'll be shagging tonight. - The blond one, maybe. - She's right fit! Just go for it. She looks like a fucking horny reindeer. Wouldn't fuck her with your dick even. - You have her. - Yeah, I'll fuck her. So, you're from the south? Do you know Arne Kolstad? No. Are you sure? He moved about ten years ago. Is it just me or did it get a bit moist here? No, it's just you, mate. - Crocodile Dundee? - Crocodile Dundee? He's my dad. - What? - Douchebag says "what". - What? - Thought so. You don't speak much. It's good to know. What? No one? - Can't get a car. No one at work. - We're in Finnmark. It's as if everything is completely... Dead. You just made it for Christmas. She's moaning like a maniac. Good girl! Hey! You know what they say. It's the quiet ones you have to watch. Are you so horny, honey? Quiet! They might hear us. Help! - What the fuck was that? - That's my brother. How do you manage to stay so calm? How does he choose his victims? Evil will drive out evil. Do you like it? Do you like it?! Say it! I'm sorry. I forgot that you don't speak. Just make some sound. I don't mind if it sounds like a retard. What kind of sign language was that? - I'm worried about Christian. - Should I ring the police? Use mine. Is Sanne okay? Hey. Is everything okay? Have the boys gone? Hi. This is Julia Buljo. I wanted to know if you'd heard from our friends, Ritika and Christian. Julia? That felt like a tremor. - It came from upstairs. - Put me through, then. Have you heard from our friends? What the hell? There is something here. Hello! Is anyone here? Don't you answer the phone? Of course. Don't you? - Do you have a car we could use? - No, Gunnar has it. - Who the hell is Gunnar? - The one who's driving the car. - There was a man here. - What do you mean? A man on the floor. Okay, you've got to stop messing around. It's not fucking funny. I'm not! There was a man there! He had lots of blood on his legs. Shh! Shh My mum died a month ago. Is he here? Sanne? Sanne? Sanne? Oh my God... Hey! You will never believe me. Do you remember the serial killer... What are you guys doing? Elisabeth! Elisabeth! What the fuck! What the hell is going on? Sanne... Ho, ho, ho... - Have you been good girls? - Run! He's not here. Here. Are you okay? She's had it. It's dead! Be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet! - What the hell? - It's better this way. Katja! Where is he?
