Start the clock. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. How you doing? Thank you, thank you. Hi. Thank you very much. ♪ ♪ Oh, just stop, please. Please, I got a lot of show. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you. I always wanted to do a special in Boston. We love you, Bill! This is one of the-- thank you. Thank you very much. This is one of the great comedy cities, and I have to tell you, the comedy gods are smiling on me today, because, um-- I've been saying for the longest time that President Bush... ...must set a timetable for removing his head from his ass. And, by god, today they went in and looked for it. They actually went in and looked for it today, and, uh.... they didn't find it. Uh... So now we don't know where it is. But at least for once in our lifetimes, we saw the words, "Bush," "operation," and "success" in the same sentence. So... This man, seriously-- The country has fuck-up fatigue... ...which is what happens when a guy fucks up so much that when he fucks up again, people go, "Well, what do you expect?" "He's a fuck up." And that's fucked up. He has now convinced himself that history will be kind to him. It's just us, in the present, who don't get it. He's the Van Gogh of presidents, you know. Not appreciated in this lifetime. I swear to god, a couple of weeks ago he was defending his legacy, and he said, "They're still debating our first president." No, they're not. Who's debating whether George Washington was a good president? He's on the $1. He's on Mount Rushmore. They named the capital after him. I think the jury is in on this guy, I do. His nickname is, "Father of the Country." That's about as Kim Jong-il as we're gonna get in America. I hope. You know... Rudy Giuliani, another brilliant assessor of people and presidents. He actually brags on the campaign trail that-- on 9/11, as the towers are going down, he turned to his super corrupt chief of police... ...and said, "Thank god George Bush is president." That alone should disqualify a person from any higher office. Oh my god. Yeah, right, Rudy. Whenever I'm looking down the barrel of Muslim fundamentalists with nuclear ambitions, I want a guy who's not smarter than a fifth-grader to be heading up our team. I kid George Bush with love. I hope that comes through. Because when it comes to who's standing on rubble, and making speeches in front of trees, and hugging black kids, he's the best. He is. And praying. America. I swear to god, what a country. The way we have a disaster-- whenever there's a disaster, Bush shows up and says, "I'm gonna pray." And people go, "Wow, he's on it." We got this covered, because he's praying, which is nearly as good as hoping it were so. And that's why I'm telling you, Rudy Giuliani is probably gonna be the next president of the United States. I'm sorry. Because it's all about image. He's got the big anti-terrorist image, you know. And I'm telling you, on January 20th, 2009, you may very well be welcoming to the White House, Rudy Giuliani and his lovely wife, whoever that may be at the time. We don't-- We don't know that now. I love it. He's had three wives. Right? Uh, McCain; two wives. Uh, Fred Thompson; two wives. Newt Gingrich; three wives. The only monogamous Republican? Mitt Romney, the Mormon. And... You know this too, that Rudy's first wife was his cousin. I'm not making that up. I think that is a very cheap way to go after the Southern vote. That's-- That's insulting to the South. And on the Democratic side, you know that the only two candidates who could not actually run together on a ticket are Hillary and Barack Obama, because that's too much non-male whiteness at one time for America. They would freak out. And the Republicans would have a field day if they ran together. First, Bush would call, like, 12 fake terror alerts. And then the Republicans would run like a series of ads about how terrorism is happening now, again! And the wolf is at the door, and this is no time to trust the country to a woman and a black teenager. Rudy Giuliani, vote for him. He knows... He was there, you know. Yeah, 'cause they did so well before-- the white men. Like, I flew in yesterday. I wish someone would just start Fly At Your Own Risk Airlines. How about that? You can... You can have your hair gel. You can have your lighter. You can have fuckin' gun. How about that? You can show up at the gate five minutes before the plane leaves, and pay in cash like in the good old 1980s. The ticket just says, "Shit happens," on the back because that's the way it is anyway in this country. This country needs to get over itself, seriously. It's not the 1950s anymore. We're not the most efficient. We're not the most healthy. We're not the most respected. I'm not hating on America. These are facts. This is a challenge to America. I'm tired of people saying, "This is the greatest country in the world." How would you know? Always from the people who've never been anywhere. Just pulling it out of their ass. It's the greatest country-- you know. Why can't it just be the greatest country for us? I'm not asking for the check, but it's so childish. "Greatest country in the world." It's like saying, "I have the greatest wife in the world." "Not just the one best suited for me. "The greatest wife in the world, "and if you could have my wife, you would kill your wife." But, look, you know what? I do understand that any country that lets me run my mouth the way I do in public deserves to be saved. I'm trying. No, I do. I... I love America. It's Americans I can't stand. These are the people. But not all Americans, just the ones who work backwards from the notion that we're the real Americans. If anything characterizes this Bush Administration, it's that. The idea that, "We're the good people from the get-go. "That's a known fact, you know. "We love Jesus and fuck our wives. "We're the good people." "So whatever we have to do to stay in power, "steal elections, tap your phones, "politicize the justice department, "that's justified because we're the real Americans." A couple of months ago at the State-- The, uh... Correspondents' Dinner, Sheryl Crow was there. She went up to Karl Rove. She wanted to talk to him. He wouldn't talk to her, and she said, "You have to talk to me. You work for me." And he said, "No, I work for the American people." You see, that's the attitude. You're Sheryl Crow. You're in rock 'n' roll. Ew. You've had many penises inside of you. Ew. You could be some kind of a Jew. I mean, you know-- It's like when Ann Coulter called John Edwards a faggot. I-- I didn't even know what that meant. I wasn't offended. I was like, "Why is he a faggot? He combs his hair?" But, no, then I got that mindset. She wasn't saying that John Edwards is a bathhouse homosexual. She meant "faggot" like, "He's a liberal pussy. You know, somebody who reads." And listens to other people. Fag stuff. Whereas the conservatives are all macho bluster. All pro-gun, and pro-death, and pro-torture. You know, real men, who go off in the woods and blast each other in the face from time to time. Real men who... you know... kill birds that don't fly. I love that. Cheney, hunting on a private ranch from a car. I'm not kidding. They went in a car. Pull over. I wanna kill that. No fag stuff. We're in a car killing things. What could be more macho than cars and killing? You know, our outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace, who, uh, when he was in Iraq, picked a peck of pickled peppers. He-- General Peter Pace said he didn't want any homosexuals in his army, because homosexuality was immoral. Well, you know what, General Peter Pace? Maybe that's true, but at least they know when to pull out of a shit hole. I had to... The ego of this surge of George Bush's, that he can think that everybody else is wrong but me, he is gonna bring democracy and freedom to the Iraqi people if he has to kill every last one of them. Because we did have an election about this, remember? The people said, "No, I think this war is over. "We don't like it." Even his own party is against it now, but George Bush, all by himself-- "The Decider." Just spitballing. You know, thinking outside the box. You know what? Thinking outside the box is for smart people. The box is for you. You need the box. Stay inside the box. Yeah, let's attack the wrong country. They won't be expecting that. Outside the box, I'll give you that. That is outside the box. What a... What a clown on the world's stage, you know. A couple of months ago, he and Laura went off to the big G8 Summit in Germany, and I'm sure the Europeans are always thrilled when the Duke and Duchess of Hazzard... ...jet in... ...to lend a little superpower charm to old Europe. But-- George Bush said he looked into Vladimir Putin's eyes-- You know this-- and saw his soul. Exactly. Now, of all the people in the world who couldn't do this, I would have to say George Bush, top of my list. I mean-- And of all the people you couldn't do this to... Vladimir Putin. I looked into his eyes, I saw Lucifer. I-- I saw black pools of ex-KGB deadness. But George Bush, god bless him, looked and... See, that's the problem with religious people like George Bush. They think they have powers that the rest of us don't have. That's why George Bush never thought he needed to learn or read about Iraq, because he prayed. He prayed to Santa Jesus. And... I saw a couple-- A couple of months ago, the President was on "60 Minutes," and he said that he was reading a book. I was very impressed. And, uh... and it was the book about the Algerian Civil War, and, yes, Algeria had a Muslim insurgency in the 1950s against a Western power, France. What a good book to read, maybe, before... ...you invaded Iraq. But, okay, I'll take what I can get. He's reading a book, but, of course, President Numbnuts takes away from the book the exact wrong message, because if George Bush is about anything with Iraq it's about the idea that if we don't beat them there, they're gonna follow us home. Yeah, 'cause that's exactly what happened with the French in Algeria. They pulled out of Algeria, and they got followed home. That's why the Eiffel Tower today is a 7-11. And the Cannes Film Festival is run by Ayatollahs. They'll follow us home. What are they, Lassie? Can I keep him, Mom? He followed me home. No, Billy, he's a terrorist. Of course you can't. This whole war has been run on slogans. George Bush, when you pull his string, says, like, five things. And they all have to be under 10 words, or else people... you know. "If we don't beat them there, they'll follow us home." "The world is better off without Saddam." "They hate us for our freedom." "We're fighting them over there so we don't have to fight them here." And my favorite, "We used to think oceans could protect us." No, we didn't. You did. You thought that. We knew our enemies had figured out boats and flying machines. Yes, we knew that here, in Tax-achussetts. You know, Senator John McCain went to Baghdad recently. Again, on one of his not-listening tours. To show how good it's going on over there, and his traveling partner, Senator Lindsey Graham. Uh... You know, they-- He said at the press conference that they went to the market. He said, "I bought five rugs for $5." Oh, great, you cheap, stupid fuck. Now we're not just invading them and killing them, we're ripping them off too. The American trifecta. Great, way to win hearts and minds in the Muslim world. Good. Jew down the people who hate the Jews. That's-- that's-- That's a great "stragedy." 'Cause, you know, at least we're not dealing with people who hold a grudge. I mean, you realize that this Iraqi Army, the "Not Ready for Prime Time Fighters..." ...they're never going to stand up, because they don't care about Iraq. They care about Sunnis and Shiites. Iraq has only been a country since 1932. Paul Newman is seven years older than Iraq. What-- What do we care about fighting for the borders of Iraq? I know George Bush is fond of saying that democracy can work anywhere. Maybe not. Maybe it's like when Elton John tried to marry that chick. Good try. And, of course, the reason that we can't leave Iraq now is because the people who predicted everything wrong about going into Iraq, that we'd find the weapons, we'd be greeted as liberators, the oil would pay for the war, every prediction dead wrong, are now the ones who are predicting what will happen if we leave. Syria will come from the west, and then Iran will come up from the east, and that'll bring in Borat's country. You know what, Nostradamus? Hand over the Magic 8-Ball. I think you've had enough shots at this. Oh god. Why don't we just declare victory and get out. I mean, this is the biggest "let's not and say we did" country that ever was anyway. Right? Everything is, you know-- Clean up New Orleans? Let's not and say we did. Protect the ports or the nuclear plant? Let's not and say we did. No Child Left Behind. That's a good "let's not and say we did," huh? Yeah, 'cause the conservatives don't really care about educating your children. What they care about is that teenagers don't fuck. Which is an easy goal, 'cause teenagers aren't horny, you know. But, yes, they've spent billions of your tax dollars to start abstinence clubs in the high schools. Making the kids take the abstinence pledge. The big pledge. And, of course, they make them do this with a big lie, 'cause they tell them, "You know what? "The only way to really be safe is not to have sex at all, "because condoms? Very unreliable. "Condoms break all the time." Okay, I've been using these things for 35 years. I've never had one condom break. Either I'm the luckiest son of a bitch who ever was, and I'm not, or this is the most reliable product since the toaster. But... But you know what? The abstinence pledge program didn't work anyway. Listen to this, they found out that among the high school girls who took the abstinence pledge, they are six times more likely to be engaging in oral sex... ...and four times more likely-- anal. I love this. I love this! The Republicans have managed to create an entire generation of apple-cheeked young girls... ...saying to their boyfriends, "Oh, no, I'm saving myself for Mr. Right." "Fuck me in the ass. Go ahead. "Just... "pump me like the piston on an old iron train." I love it. I kid the Republicans. I hope I'm not piling on. Well, I'm sorry, but they can't govern, and they can't govern because they don't care about governing. That's not what they're good at. They're good at winning elections, but governing? Please, they run on a platform of government is inefficient. Yes, the way you do it. This is the crowd that wants to build a 700 mile wall along our 2,100 mile-long border with Mexico. You know what? I think instead of building a wall along the border, build a Walmart. Build a 2,100 mile-long Walmart, and the workers could come in the back. The shoppers could come in the front. Just like anywhere else in America. But it would be 2,100 miles long, and still the one register open. You know, I understand why rich people vote Republican. I never will understand why poor people vote for the Republicans. I mean, no offense, but they are just tricked into doing it. And it is sort of what fucks up democracy, because the regular people need to actually vote their interests, 'cause if they don't, the only thing-- That's all we have left. Otherwise, the lobbyists, and the corporations, and the moneyed interests win. That's why democracy doesn't work anymore, because the lobbyists win. And, you know, lobbying stories never make the TV news. So I'm gonna tell a few tonight. Here's one of my favorites. The FCC, the governing body in Washington that was so outraged that Janet Jackson's milkshake... ...was on television for one blurry, black second. An outrage. Okay, turns out that their regulators have accepted in the last 10 years over 2,500 vacation trips from the broadcast industry, from the people they're regulating. Okay, that would be an outrage, because I don't know if you're like me, but when someone gives me a vacation trip, I like them. Is that me? Am I weird? I'm weird with that, right? No, people love a trip. Even a shitty trip. On the old Dating Game they used to send them to Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. You remember this? When it was behind the Iron Curtain. People would be like, "We're going to Dubrov-- "What the fuck? "What? Who cares, we're going!" They didn't-- that's-- 'cause people love a trip. They don't care where it is. And I tell you why they love a trip; because people think on a trip, "I might get laid." They do. It's not happening here, but Cleveland! That's where it could happen. I could... And I don't just mean single people. Married people love a trip. Oh, you kid-- A trip is a cue to fuck. Married people need a cue to fuck, a prompting. You can't just fuck. What are you, sick? You're married. Oh god. That's why there are certain fuck days on the calendar. Wedding anniversary? Fuck day! Yes, we fuck on the day we fucked before to commemorate that fucking. Whether we need it or not, we're gonna fuck on that day, by god. Valentine's Day? Fuck day! Yes, we fuck when there's chocolates and flowers around. We fuck. Your birthday? You might even get a blowjob on your birthday. I know. It looks like everyone's getting laid in America. Doesn't it? I mean, if you look at the media; television and movies, you know. Everyone's always, you know-- advertisements in magazines-- Billboards, everyone is... but it's a mirage. Not everyone lives at the MTV Beach House. If this country wasn't really so sexually repressed, why would there be so much perversion? Why is there-- Why is there this rash, excuse the phrase... ...of hot, blonde, 20-something middle school teachers fucking their 13-year-old boy toy students? Which I'm for, by the way. Seriously. You know. See, America's big on no-- no, uh-- Zero tolerance and no double standards. No, you know what? Sometimes a double standard is necessary, 'cause there's two things. Yes, when a 28-year-old male teacher fucks his 13-year-old female student, that is a crime, but when 28-year-old Debra Lafaye fucks that kid, that's a crime we didn't get it on videotape. Wow. That's... That kid is not traumatized for life. I should have been so traumatized for life. So scarred! Yeah, there's no such thing as zero tolerance and no double standards. You know what? Nuance isn't everything. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. Even with fucking kids, there's nuance. For example, Michael Jackson. Now I'm not defending what he did if he did it, but you know what? Even Michael Jackson's worst accusers never said that he bent them over a table and... you know... Catholic shit. No. No. No, the-- the worst they said that Michael Jackson ever did was a little grabby-grabby under the covers, which, don't get me wrong, I don't condone that either. That's a crime, but... a little nuance, okay? Because you know what? When I was 12 years old, I was once brutally beaten up on the playground by two bullies. Just punched in the face. And if I could go back to 1968, and trade that experience with being gently masturbated by a pop star, I would do it in a New York minute. Frankie Valli could jerk me off. Glen Campbell could jerk me off. Tommy James and the Shondells could jerk me off. The Rascals. Gary Puckett & The Union Gap could jerk me off. The Zombies could jerk me off. The Drifters. Not even the group, just people who were out of work... ...could come in and jerk me off. Would still be better than being punched in the face. But I digress. That's not really... ...what I was talking about. I don't know how I got there. I forgot I have free water here tonight. Okay, lobbying stories. Here's-- here's another great lobbyist stories. You know, after 9/11 they put these barriers in front of the Capitol. Well, about a year ago they finally stopped a guy. It was Patrick Kennedy. Congressman Patrick Kennedy was driving to work at 3:00 a.m. Why? Because he was on Ambien, which makes you crazy, and he thought he had to get up out of bed at 3:00 a.m. and go to work. But that's okay, 'cause Ambien is a prescription drug, and they have a lobby, and if your name is on the little bottle, it really doesn't matter what it makes you do because the United States government is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry. So that's cool. That's okay. Meanwhile, marijuana has been exhaustively tested over the last 30 years, just by me. And nothing. That doesn't hurt you, but not a-- not a month goes by when there's not a headline in the newspaper about some prescription drug doing something awful. We found out that Vioxx relieves the pain and stiffness of arthritis by killing you. Couple of weeks ago it was Avandia, whatever that is, raises heart attack levels by 43 %. That seems like a lot to me. Ask your undertaker if Avandia is right for you. I mean, seriously. If this shit was any more lethal, the Chinese would put it in your toothpaste. And-- And have you taken note of the fact that every prescription drug has an "X" or a "Z" in the name? You know, Vioxx, and Paxil, and Oxycontin, and Celebrex, and Fosamax, and Prozac. Are Americans really that dumb, that all you have to do is put an "X" or a "Z" in the name and they go, "Well, I'm not a doctor, but I can see this is serious medicine"? I think they come up with the pill before they come up with the disease. Did anybody have restless leg syndrome... ...before they had a pill for it? Did you get calls-- "Bill, I'd love to make the party, "but the old restless leg is acting up again, I--" I never knew that I had a fungus monster living under my big toenail. There's a Tasmanian Devil in there, apparently. And not just in there, it's partying. Have you seen the commercial? I swear to god, there is a bacteria playing the trombone. That is pretty serious. I'm waiting for the pill they come up with for your morning hard-on. Do you need Flacciddix? Flacciddix makes your penis soft and manageable when you need it most. And it's got an "X" right in the name. So you know it's serious medicine. I see a lot of pills advertised to relieve stress. I think that's a huge scam. Stress is life. Sorry to burst the bubble. But, you know, I have good days and bad days. I never have a no-stress day. Do you? It's the most natural thing in the world. It's in nature. Look in nature. You ever look at a little woodland creature? It's a nervous wreck. Look at a poor little squirrel. You know, it's like-- Even when it's eating lunch, it's like-- Fuck, is something gonna swoop down or bite me in the ass... Animals are such toast anyway. You know, here's a good-- Here's a great lobbying story. Okay, our national parks, right, our shared national treasure, and birthright, and all that, okay? So they have a charter, and in the charter it describes something called, "park purposes." You know, what people do in a park. Like, you know, hiking, and boating, and camping, and picnicking. The Bush Administration added mining. Mining. Oh, it's very relaxing, mining. I love to get out there in the parks and do some mining. I tell you. Whenever the old restless leg is acting up I get out to the parks and I get a pneumatic drill and a helmet with a big light on it. It's like falling asleep in a hammock. It's just-- Wouldn't you think that when it came to the environment, conservatives would be on the side of conserving? Why-- why doesn't that make sense? But they're not. They're on the side of making Al Gore look ridiculous, because if you can make Al Gore look ridiculous, he equals global warming, and then that's ridiculous. Except that it's not really about Al Gore. You know what? It's not. It's about losing the polar icecaps, and then the seas rising, and then losing Venice, and losing Holland, and losing Manhattan, and losing New Orleans, and losing Florida, and that's why I believe Al Gore, because if there's one thing he knows, it's losing Florida. I told you it was easy to make fun of Al Gore. But seriously, I think there are people who think we don't really have to do anything about the environment because technology will save us. They'll come up with some sort of big space Dustbuster... No, I don't think so. Because I don't think the technology I have works. I don't. I mean, iPods don't hold a charge. Cell phones work, basically, whenever the fuck they want to. The shit doesn't work. You know what works? Condoms. Condoms, my friends... ladies and Jews, work every time. I think that technology has just served to make us more passive aggressive. Like, I love email, 'cause you can just say what you have to say, and push send and leave the room, and I'll deal with your bullshit later. We like that. We really don't want to talk to each other. You know, the phone machine. We got so used to getting the machine that if someone answers the phone, it's like, "Oh..." "Well, that's rude." "That is awfully rude of you. "That puts me in the awkward position of having to talk to you." We don't want to talk to each other. Cars now have television screens in the back seat, 'cause god forbid you talk to the person in the front seat. "Just 'cause we're in the same car doesn't mean I have to talk to you... "Dad." And then they blame the break up of the family on gay marriage. Although I guess not anymore. That was-- that was the big wedge issue of 2004. The big, fear-driven bogey man was gay marriage. But you know, for 2008; immigration. Oh, yes. Brown is the new pink. Yes. And, boy, that Ricky Martin can't catch a break. Jeez. Now wait, this is true. In 2004... Senator Rick Santorum said that gay marriage was a slippery slope to bestiality. True. Lance and Timmy get married, and the next thing you know, the cat wants to blow them. That's... ...how the cat knows they're married? No, I don't know... But it-- it's always this fear, you know. Fear of something, and this time coming up it's gonna be the fear that there are dark, swarthy people out there and if they're not coming here to kill us, they're coming here to take our sweet valet parking jobs. You know, the-- The far right in Congress-- the tough guys, but also the ones who say they're the big Christians-- they spent all year trying to figure out the best way to punish the people who do the worst jobs for the least pay. The people who clean toilets, and pick lettuce, and wipe asses for less than minimum wage. That gravy train has to stop. Could anything be less Christian than exploiting the poor and least fortunate among us? I'm sorry religion is so retarded, but it is. I-- No, no. I know I see people looking at me like... Sorry. I'm sorry. But look, I was just at the newly opened creationist Museum in Kentucky, if this doesn't say it all-- There is now a creationist Museum dedicated to the idea of creationism, and they have this exhibit of a giant dinosaur with a saddle on his back. Because the world is only 5,000 years old so man and the dinosaur had to co-exist, and of course we rode them. A theory I thought laughable at the age of eight, when I saw it on The Flintstones. Aye, aye, aye! And you know what? The problem is that the people with the most ridiculous ideas are always the people who are most certain of them. These people know when life began. They know when your life begins and when it ends. Which is so silly, 'cause you don't know. Did you think Terri Schiavo was dead? I did. But I have to say, a couple of months later, a brain-dead woman gave birth to a baby, and I said, "Congratulations, Britney!" You go, girl! But these right-wingers changed the Constitution to insert a feeding tube into Terri Schiavo, and I thought it was wonderfully ironic that at the very moment they were doing that, Pope John Paul, the old pope, was dying, and they offered him the tube. And he was like, "Fuck the tube!" The Pope was gangster about that shit. He was-- "I don't need no stinkin' tube. "I'm the pope, how would that look?" When the Pope died, Bush went over to Rome to his funeral, and I've never seen him happier. He was like a kid at the circus. He was very impressed by that funeral. And you know what? I don't blame him. That was an impressive funeral. That was a nine-hour funeral, went off without a hitch. And there was so many lighting cues, and sound cues, and red choirs, and then the white choir, and the body comes in, and the body comes out, and this was going-- You know what? I don't know if everyone in that Catholic Church is gay, but they sure have enough to put on a show. Wow. There is a fine line between Liturgy and Liberace in that Catholic Church. But the pope-- there's another one who's pro-life as long as it's microscopic. They all think they know exactly when life begins and that's why we can't have stem cell research, which actually would help real people, but they know for sure that life begins the moment the sperm hits the hoo-ha. Before the man can light a cigarette, there is a third person in that room. Before he can get up and get a towel, there is a third person in that room. Before the woman can even say, "What are you thinking?" What happened to men in this country. Seriously. Did you see that story... about a year ago, out of Atlanta, about this woman named Ashley Smith who was kidnapped by this thug, and he was a thug. You know, he was on trial, and he took over the courtroom where they were trying him. Shot three people in the courtroom, hijacked a car, shot another guy, kidnapped her, and she talked to him for 10 straight hours, and he literally waved a white flag. He was like, "Take me back to prison, just shut this bitch up." And... And I gotta say, I think that says it all about men and women, because women need someone to listen, and men need someone to shut the fuck up! Every time I'm on an airplane, before we leave, sitting there, every guy around me is on the cell phone-- "Yeah, we're on the runway now." "Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you--" Oh, there's so much love out there in America. "Yeah, we're third in line for takeoff." Why don't you just get a husband cam? You know, just... get a camera that would fit on your head, and then she could see where you are every second of the day, and you wouldn't have to check in, you pathetic, pussy-whipped piece of shit. You know what commercial bugs the shit out of me? That Cialis commercial. You know, the all-day boner pill? "When the tender moment becomes the right moment." Oh, Christ. It's your own wife. Can't you just bone somebody? I mean... you married her for crying out loud. They show the guy taking her shopping, they're in the hot tub together, and touching fingers, you know. Is it this much work to fuck your own wife in America? You have to keep a hard-on for 36 hours? Just for when the tender and the right moment finally-- Pow! There you go. Why don't you do a rain dance, you piece of... Has to be the tender moment? I think a good grudge fuck would do the both of you a world of good. I think it would do the whole country a world of good. I'm telling you, I think this country is so sexually frustrated, and that is very fertile ground for the Christian right to conflate morals and values with sex. Because if they didn't demonize sex, then they'd have to start thinking about what was really moral, or really a value. The Republicans think sex is bad because with them it always is. It is. They're-- I'm sorry, but... They're just... doughy, asexual, wonky white people, and if you had to have sex with them, it would be over in an excruciating three minutes. It's just-- And from the headlines of the last year, I gather the only sex they're really good at is gay sex. Really. Jeff Gannon in the White House Press Room. Representative Mark Foley. The Reverend Ted Haggard. I mean, that's a lot of gay when you're running against it in every election. And what is this campy fixation they have with all things Ronald Reagan? I mean, they talk about Reagan the way gay guys talk about Barbra Streisand. They do. I think they want him on a stamp so they can lick his ass. I think they want to name airports after him so they can say, "I'm coming into Reagan!" Hey, look, I was never that big a fan of Ronald Reagan, but he did one thing which I thought was fantastic, which was in 1983 we had troops in the Middle East. Yes, in Lebanon, and they got their barracks blown up. And what did Ronald Reagan do? He cut and ran. He said, "These people are fucking nuts. "Let's get the hell out of here." Thank you, Ronald Reagan, for that shining example of how to behave in the Middle East. Thank you, you're very nice. Whereas George Bush thinks that God speaks to him. And, by the way, if God looked over the whole country, the whole world, and made George Bush president, how good is God, seriously? But, yes, he thinks God made him president. So he needs to have big ideas, like transforming the Middle East. One State of the Union Address, I swear to god, he said, "We're going to Mars." Really? In the middle of the War on Terror, we're-- He did-- What he actually said was, "We're going to Mars and worlds beyond." Easy, little man. We can't get from Baghdad to the Baghdad airport. We can't get the people out of the trailers in New Orleans, the trailers that are killing them. Did you see that yesterday? I mean, I know that Bill Clinton was an evil man, who liked sex and sex liked him... ...but does anybody doubt that if he had been president when that storm hit, that the people, you know, the actual people of New Orleans, would have been better off? I mean, he would have, first of all-- That's okay, but-- First of all, he would have read about it before it happened. You know, fag stuff. He would have been down there before it happened. He would have not slept for a week. He would have stayed up working on it. That's who he was. Yes, he would have been getting blown the whole time. Who cares? Come on, it's New Orleans. You're not gonna send Slick Willie to the Big Easy and have nothing happen. But so what? He could handle it. He was a multitasker. This numbnuts isn't even a unitasker. You realize that on the third day of Katrina, Fidel Castro offered aid to America. I'm not kidding. He had a big press conference and he said, "Some president in this hemisphere must do something." Now what do you think Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh would have said if Bill Clinton was president when that happened? They would have said that Bill Clinton has brought this country so low that Fidel Castro, a Mexican... Is he the worst president ever? Ever! I mean... - Yes. ...when this man's term is over, he has to walk back to Texas. The sheer volume... The volume of scandals, of bloopers, boners, and practical jokes-- Katrina, and Abu Ghraib, Walter Reed, Alberto Gonzales, not getting Bin Laden, outing a CIA agent, he tried to appoint his cleaning lady to the Supreme Court. I'm not making this shit up. He tried to sell the ports to an Arab country. Because nothing ever gets in the way of crony capitalism. He would try to sell the Red Cross to Dracula... ...if it brought in campaign cash. He sat there for seven minutes when he was told the words, "The country is under attack." "Not that I'm suggesting you get up on it." "That was not the implication at all. "I'm just saying, FYI, the country..." I just hope the next time people go into the voting booth they have one idea in their head, which is that there is a little more to this job than just not getting blown. Yeah, not getting blown-- vital, I agree. Very important, but there's a little more. Yes, we took a chance, and we elected a guy who we wanted to have a beer with, but maybe next time we'll understand, no, we need an exceptional person in this job. For all their flaws, Al Gore was an exceptional person, John Kerry was an exceptional person... ...George Bush is a special person. He is. And the most infuriating thing about him is that he didn't even know how bad he sucks. That's what I hate, the way he ends every press conference, every language-mangling... ...embarrassing press conference, by walking off with that smirk on his face, like, "Nailed it." This man... This man! And you know he just dreads the next time there is a disaster, because whenever there's a disaster, then he has to bring in his dad and Bill Clinton together. He's got a look on his face like, "Not fair! "They know things." And to me, that's the ultimate key to George Bush. It's that he wants to be the smartest guy in the room. But to be the smartest guy in the room, you kind of have to fill that room with a bunch of dim bulbs. And that's how you get the Alberto Gonzales', and the Harriet Miers, and the, "You're doing a heck of a job," Brownies. And my favorite... My favorite Bush appointee of all time, Dr. David Hager, who, to me, sums up everything we've gone through in the last six and a half years, because Dr. David Hager was on the advisory board of the FDA, making decisions about women's health and reproductive services. And Dr. Hager was a super Christ-y, evangelical gynecologist. It's kind of hard to find one of those, but these are the Bush people. Back in 1991 they found a black guy for the Supreme Court who wasn't that crazy about black people. So they're good, you know. And... what had attracted the Bush team to Dr. Hager was that he and his wife had written a book suggesting that a remedy for women experiencing menstrual pain-- reading scripture. How's that working out for you gals, here, in the Boston area? Good? But that's not the funny part. Listen to this. So after 30 years of marriage, Dr. David Hager and his wife get divorced, and she says that in the last few years of their marriage, he was anally raping her in her sleep. And she didn't even take the pledge. You know, just... Now I assume she woke up at some point during the proceedings. I mean, if you can sleep through that, you're a... Your ass is a little loose, I'm not gonna lie about-- But that's not the funny part either. The funny part is that when confronted with this accusation, Dr. David Hager did not exactly deny it. She said his excuse was he missed. Which-- okay, first of all, just sort of implies that it's okay to vaginally rape your wife in her sleep. That's cool. Honey, sleep, I'm just gonna fuck you. Please. I know, you got a busy day tomorrow. I'm just gonna fuck you. That's... As Christ would, you know. Stabbing your wife unexpectedly, unwantedly in the pussy in the middle of the night, that's okay. That's what the Christians would do, but in the ass? Please, no, that's animals. Who would do that? A Hindu, a Jew, but not the Christians. No. And two-- Oh my god, he missed. I mean, the Bush people have been in power so long, they forgot how to lie. They're like zoo lions that don't know how to hunt anymore. He missed? So what you have here, is a gynecologist... ...claiming he cannot find his own wife's vagina. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Bush Administration. And I thank you very much. You were a terrific audience, as I knew you would be. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. ♪ ♪
