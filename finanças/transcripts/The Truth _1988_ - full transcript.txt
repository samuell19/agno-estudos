Your Honor My client needs some rest My client needs some rest She's not suitable to keep on Can we have another witness? -Are you a Christian? -No Then follow this I, Yam Ping Ping do solemnly swear What I say is the whole truth and nothing but the truth Defending council to interrogate Why did you return to the scene? I left the ear-rings Tell the jury What did you see behind the door? Fat was sleeping in bed And the woman pointing at him with the gun How can she say so?

You stupid witch! Mind your words! Quiet Defending council obstructs the course of justice He conspired to give false statement He conspired to give false statement I ask for a detail investigation and see if he needs to be prosecuted And will give the statement to the solicitor chamber See if Mr. C.P. Lau has to be disqualified We have the verdict in the afternoon Court Court I am sorry, I have to listen to the cop I need to make money Kid, you are very foolish What a pity! You need more experience Don't worry, Lau Just Ping's statement against you You may not lose the case I deserve it I should accept the settlement It's better than now Sorry to disturb you Before the jury comes to the verdict Is the settlement still there? You change the charge and she plagues guilty You are humorous No kidding I won't settle now I beg you just help me this time Raymond Lau, you are finished Take care of yourself first Think what you can do after the jail If not murder for her it will be manslaughter I'll send her to jail for 30 years 15 more years it's because of you Because you are too stubborn Your Honor, the jury After Ping's statement I think you won't believe me anymore My statement is of no use now But then... I wanna say something... Something deep down in my heart The accused has a real bad life She was a club girl And got physically hurt real bad And had been a prostitute for 20 years Forth 20 years, she had enough Her doctor told me she's really sick And had only 4 to 5 years to live Even though she has a bad life She's still a human being She had not hurt anybody Right, she killed Wong Fat But think... Why she wanted to kill the cop so badly? Why she wanted to kill the cop so badly? Why? The prosecution said it's for revenge For Wong wanted to arrest her That's a lie She wanted to protect her son In 1942 because of the situation she sent her son to an orphanage But she kept her duty as a mother And saved every cents she could for her son's education But... She dares not to meet her own son For her son has his own status She doesn't want to ruin his future And Wong Fat found this secret He blackmailed her And she had no choice but to kill him She did it for her own son Can her son just because for his sake leave his mother all alone? He can't, he surely can't I know it's true Because... I am her own son! The jury, what I say is... If I can help her and we reunite and let here to enjoy the rest of her life I would trade it with my own life Whether a barrister or not That's not important Mom The head of jury Do you all agree with the decision? Yes Is the accused guilty of charge? No Then guilty of manslaughter? Yes Accused stand up Wait, your Honor Before the verdict I wanna say something for the jury Go on We have pity on the accused We ask for a light sentence for her And we think you are unfair to her You stand on the side of the prosecution And if the sentence is heavy that means something wrong with your personality And you can't be a judge And now I have the verdict Guilty of manslaughter. 3 years imprisonment But for the sake of her health I suspend her sentence for 5 years Lau Wai Ian, you can leave now Mom, you are released. Don't cry! You can leave, really We can be together Let's go -What about you? -Your case”? Don't worry He'll be okay - I promise! -Thank you Nancy, congratulations I'm sorry, I didn't know the truth
