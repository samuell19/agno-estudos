(alarm ringing) (groaning) - And that's the latest on the Middle East situation. And on the local front, we have a story from Scott. - Cal Lewis, the serial killer, who had previously escaped from a maximum security prison, has been apprehended and is safely behind bars. - So I guess we can all rest a little easier knowing that. But first it's time for the weather, with our own Dedra Hagan. Dedra. - Hi I'm Dedra Hagan with your local and national forecast for today. Locally we are experiencing clear blue skies with a high expected at 86. Winds are not too subtle at 20 miles per hour, but should die down by early this evening. Nationally showers are peppering in the Midwest, while the heavier storms are hitting the Carolinas. And as you know, Hurricane Harold wreaked havoc on the Florida coast last week. Damage estimates are in the millions, but I'm told Hurricane Harold is now under control. - Thank you Dedra. Well I'm sorry to say that this is the last telecast of our wonderful weather girl Dedra. She has completed her internship, and is now ready to go on to better lands. - She'll be going to stay in Nevada, where she has a full time position as a weather girl, and we wish her all the luck with her new job. Thanks Dedra. - Thank you. - [Stageman] That's a wrap. - Susan do you know how much longer before those reports are done? - Uh captain I should have these for you in just a few minutes. - [Captain] Okay. - Hey captain! Captain! - [Captain] What? - He's killed Toby, he's cut his throat. - Who, who are you talking about? - Cal. - [Captain] Who? - Cal, Cal Lewis and he's escaped again, he's gone. - Lewis escaped? Shit. (thrilling music) (helicopter blades whirring) (dispatchers talking) (dog barking) (dog barking) (pop music) (chatting) - Whatever he's saying don't believe a word of it. - Oh really? - Dedra, I want to introduce you to Monique. She's a world famous psychic. - Hello honey. - I'm so glad to meet you, I'm delighted. I've been a friend of your mother's for years, and I've heard so many nice things about you. - Oh, oh, thank you. - Attention everybody, I want to offer a toast Dedra. You've done a wonderful job here and we're all gonna miss her, let's wish her good luck. - [All] Good luck. - [Lady With Curly Hair] To Dedra! - Thank you. (laughing) - Are you excited? - I'm so excited. Here have some cake, it's so delicious. - Oh thank you so much. - Have you given any thought to who's the replacement of Ms. Hagan? - Yeah, she's thinking of me. Ms. Yani I've been doing this for a number of years. Look I mean, maybe we should go in your office, decide what you're gonna do, it'll help if you take a look at my resume. - Who are you? - Look at it very closely. - You make it very difficult. - Well, - Gary I'd like to see your resume. - Oh I'd be happy to give you a reading. You can just come over any time, no charge. - Oh that'd be great. I'd love to know what my future holds for me if it ain't bad. (laughing) - Oh certainly.

(sighing) (thrilling music) - More money. (laughing) (groaning) (thudding) (groaning) - This just in, I had previously announced the serial killer Cal Lewis had been apprehended and was safely behind bars. - He killed one of the prison guards and has escaped again. The station is asking anyone who has any information that may help lead to the capture or the recapture of this person to please call our emergency number, there on your screen. - Please if you have any additional information, please call the number on your screen. (thrilling music) (dogs barking) (helicopter hovering) (train announcer speaking) (birds chirping) - Hello. Oh it's good to see you, I'm glad you could come. Come right in my dear. - Thank you. Oh it's nice to see you again. - Oh it's nice to see you too. I'm looking forward to the reading. - Oh my.

Here it is see, now that's my version of mother nature. She's got a boulder blocking in this hand, she only needs her thumb to hold it because she's all powerful as you know. And with the lightening and the rain. On the other hand is roses and sunshine. Mother nature is wonderful. And that's the ocean of life rushing past. And the heart signifies love, because mother nature is love. Everything in nature is loving. Don't you agree? - Fascinating like that. - Have a chair my dear. I know you're anxious to get on with the reading, and so am I. - Yes, yes I'm actually quite excited about it. I've never done anything like this before, but I figured with my new career move that it'd be kind of interesting to see what my future holds for me. - Oh me too. I know it's going to be wonderful and exciting. Now I'm going to just have to concentrate, so that I can see the future. - Okay, is there anything you need me to do? Would you prefer that I just sit here or am I supposed to be involved somehow? - Just relax my dear. - [Dedra] Okay. (sparkling) (eerie music) - Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. (breathing hard) I wish I could tell you wonderful beautiful things, but that's not what I see. - What do you mean? - What I see is dark and foreboding and dangerous and evil. - What are you telling me? - Danger involves you my dear. - What danger? - Just let me tell you this my dear, be careful. In all that you do be careful. - I need to know more. You can't just leave me hanging here like this. - I tell you what I'll do. This afternoon I'll go into a deep trance, hoping I can see more and tell you more. I'm sorry I had to give you this news. - This is not exactly what I expected. - I'm sorry it wasn't. - I guess I better get going now. Thank you for your time. Well I'm ready to go. I just feel like I'm forgetting something. - You are your PowerBar. - Thanks. - I want you to take this with you. - Pepper spray? Mom. - Keep it with you at all times. It might get you out of a tight spot. - It could also get me in a lot of trouble. - You never know. - For you, anything mom.

That's what you're worried about? There's nothing much I can help with on that Ralph, but he is your identical twin, right? - Yes, but remember the trial? - Yes I do. - He said he would kill all of us, and I don't know what to do or where to go. I thought that you could maybe help me. - He was a pretty psychotic fellow at that time. - And he is psychotic. You must remember one thing. - What's that? - You're in just as much danger as I am. - I appreciate the warning Ralph, but the only thing you can do is get in touch with the authorities and cooperate with them.

Alright, bye. - Car's only worth 1,200 dollars. - Well that's a decision you'll have to make one way or another. You can either repair it or leave it here with the rest of the junk I got around here. - Look I don't have. - Whatever you can do. - I don't have 1,200 dollars but I'll tell you what I'll do. When I get into Vegas I will wire you the money if you can just start working on it right now. I'll wire you the money, I'll leave my car here with my other things, and I'll come back in two days. - You can leave it here, but when we get the money then we'll start work on it. - Excuse me for interrupting, but how far is Las Vegas? - About 285 miles. - You're going to Vegas. - Yeah I am, why do you need a ride? - Well I don't know. If I leave my car with you and wire you the money in a couple of days will you fix it? - Yeah we'll start on it soon as we get the money. - Will it be safe here? - Pretty safe as it could be anyplace. - 'Cause I've got all my stuff in the car I'm not gonna be able to take with me. - Well hurry up and get your things I'll be happy to give you a ride. - I'll just grab what I need and I'll leave my car with you.

No phone, no food, no water. - I've got to take a leak. - You've got to take a leak? Now you've got to take a leak? Why couldn't you have gone at the restaurant with the rest of us? - You know what's funny, the urge just didn't hit. - Oh now the urge hits you? What do you want me to do Cal? - I want you to find a spot because I'd like to take a leak. - Alright we'll find a spot. When you see a spot Cal that's good enough for you, you just let me know and I'll pull over. - That'll work just fine Bob. Relax Marsha, relax. Just relax dear. Just relax dear. Oh right up here. A rest area, how 'bout that? - How 'bout that, my lucky day, uhuh. - [Cal] Bob, is Marsha always so sensitive? - [Bob] Well Marsha's a good kind of kid, but these kinds of things tend to worry her. - [Cal] You know I'm just getting the feeling that she doesn't like me. - I'm just a little nervous that's all. - [Bob] What the hell are you doing? - Oh just a little insurance. Down there. (dramatic music) (thudding) Come quick, Bob's been hurt. - Oh my god. Oh my god. What's happened? - [Cal] He's down here. - Oh. Oh Bob, oh my god. Bob!

Let us talk for a minute, we'll get back to you. Thank you I really appreciate it. - [Wife] She's stranded what do you think dear? - Oh we're not gon' give her a ride, not a chance. You don't know what she's got in that bag. You can't be too careful out in a place like this. We're not giving anybody a ride. (car starting) (somber music) - Excuse me mam, I'm sorry to bother you but I need to get to Nevada and I'm stranded here. If there's any way possible you could give me a ride. - I'll ask my husband. - Please I, I need to get back. I'd really appreciate it, I've been out here all day. - This girl want a lift? - Yeah. - Well let's give her a lift, she seems to be a nice girl. - No. Honey I'm wearing diamonds, she saw the diamonds. - Well I don't think this girl's gonna hurt you you know to take your diamonds. She seems like a nice girl. Let's give her a lift. - Oh come on no. A nice girl, what you don't know. These girls are as vicious as some of these guys. - Oh honey you don't trust anybody, I don't understand you. - Todd I do not want to lose this. You want me to lose this? No way. - Alright doll. - Please come on, let's just go. Go, go, go. - Okay. - Please darling. - Alright. (somber music) - You need a lift? - No I'm waiting for a friend thanks. - Suit yourself. - You know what, I think I could use a lift after all. - Alright, get in. Where are you headed? - Nevada. - [Cal] Oh yeah? That's where I'm headed. - That's good. I've had the worst day ever. My car broke down, some guy picked me up but then that didn't work out. And no one would give me a ride at the rest area. I had the worst time today. Absolutely awful. - You know you've got to be real careful. You can't trust just anyone. - Yeah I know. - [Cal] I'm headed to Nevada myself. - Well thanks for offering me a ride, I really appreciate it. - We're gonna have to stop up here and get a little gas. - Oh that'd be great maybe I can get something to drink, so dehydrated from walking. - So what's your name? - Dedra. - I'm Jeff. - Nice to meet you Jeff. Right up here it looks like a lazy little town. That must be where the gas is. - [Dedra] Oh, be nice if I could get something to eat. - [Cal] How long you been on the road? - Well I was traveling for several days when my car broke down. And I couldn't fix it, well I didn't have the money to get it fixed. But it's been hell, I've had the worst day of my life. (eerie music) - He made a real mess here. - How long you figure they've been dead? - Uh I'd say about, ballpark figure, I'd say about two hours. - Have you called the coroner yet? - Yeah coroner's on his way, he's on his way. (sighing) - Detective Bureau please. Yeah Captain Moore please. Yeah Captain Moore, this is John Mays. Yeah I'm out at the scene now. Yeah there's no doubt in my mind, it's got all the ire marks of Cal Lewis. Yeah he's definitely on his way into Vegas. Look, I think it'd be a good idea if you put one of your plain clothes detectives on Doctor Anjhi. Yeah, she was one he threatened also. Also I think you ought to have Ms. Fedro picked up, put her in protective custody. Yeah that's Cal's ex-girlfriend. Yeah he's made threats toward both of them. There's no doubt he's on his way there to try to find them. Yeah it's pretty well wrapped up out here. Yeah I'll contact you as soon as I get back in town. Okay. - When I get to Nevada I'm gonna ask for an advance at my new job so that I can get my car fixed, and then wire it down there and have the guys put in a new transmission, that's what's wrong with it. - You know you should carry credit cards. - Yeah but I've got some bad credit right now so. I didn't have a lot of money to get down here. - Well I guess I'm not borrowing any money from you. (laughing) - If I had some I'd give you some for the ride but I'm sorry I don't. (suspenseful music) - [Radio Speaker] Authorities report that escaped serial killer Cal Lewis may be in the area. He is considered dangerous and may be armed. The suspect is Caucasian, six foot two, thin wiry, last seen with a beard. His victims have included at least three of report. - That'll be $12.40. Have a good day. (dramatic music) (thudding) - Damn flat. Hope this car's got a spare. - Don't you know? It's your car, right? - It's a rental. - Okay, sure. - You okay? - Fine. - I'm gonna check the trunk, I'll be right back. - Alright. - It's the right rear. Why don't you get out and stretch your legs? - Alright. - Wait, where do you think you're going? - To stretch my legs. - I think you're gonna stay right here and help me fix this flat tire.

Ah, you're clear. - Thanks. - Hey what happened to your eyes? - Radiator steam, it blew up. - What are you doing for it? - Nothing. - Aw man, I'd have that looked at if I were you. You know there's a healthcare center right down the road about three of four miles. It's on the right. - Yeah? - I'd stop in and have it looked at. - Think they're open? - Yeah 24 hours. - Thanks. - [Clerk] Yeah. - David that's a nasty burn you have on your face. How'd that happen? - Carburetor fire on my truck. - Oh it looks almost like one of those pepper spray burns. - Am I going to be okay? - Yes but we're gonna have to irrigate your eye and your face and we'll give you a shot of some cortisone and some tablets of Benadryl. - Can we get started? - You bet. I'll have the nurse come right in. Nurse, this is David Smith. He had a nasty burn to his face. And we irrigated his face and his eye. And we gave him a shot of cortisone, 10 milligrams. Also we gave him a prescription for Benadryl, 25 miligrams, QID for three days. Here's his chart. - Alrighty, I will take care of that. Meanwhile here's a chart of a young white female that was brought in earlier, and she's now in room two. She was found out in the desert and she was dehydrated. We have her stabilized right now, but you really need to take a look into her as soon as you can. - Okay I can do that right now. And would you start some IVs for her? - Absolutely. And doctor, to be honest, if that young couple hadn't found her out in the desert, she probably wouldn't have made it. - Thanks. - Excuse me. Can we get an IV started in room two, room two please thank you. Alright, let's get you settled up here, get you your prescription. - [Cal] I'll pay cash. - Alright, let's see how much you owe.
