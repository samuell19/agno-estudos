Everyone! Everyone, please, please! Quiet down so we can hear one another speak! I've just been informed the Russians have launched a nuke at 2200QL. Impact with the asteroid in T-five minutes. Mr. Turgenev, this is a global situation. And any actions to be considered must be mutually agreed upon among all the delegates! This summit has gotten nowhere in days with all the arguing and petty bickering amongst all of you. So we, Russia, have taken action. Heaven help us if this fails, Mr. Turgenev. And when we succeed, Mr. Chairman, what then? We forget about your threats. We accept your apology. We shake hands. We have video downlink from the Russian shuttle, Buran 1. Let's get it up on the screen. Here we go. It's a momentary loss. Download will be back up in a second. The signal just needs to be reacquired by the satellite. See what you've done! Your country's arrogance has jeopardized the entire planet further! Those smaller fragments will surely hit earth long before the core! Nikola? Did you take your medicine? Just took it. You need to stay on top of that. It makes no difference, Elaine. It's only prolonging the inevitable, huh? You're gonna make a go at it, aren't you? Hmm. You're going to stop 2200QL? One last grand accomplishment to cement my legacy, huh? Yeah, but, please don't talk like that. Look, the heat from the nuclear warhead was able to break up the outer crust. But the core must be composed of something we've never seen before, something like a substance that is impurity free graphite, yet crystalline in structure. Finding diamonds in an asteroid core is quite rare. Indeed. Indeed. If this is one of those rare instances, how do we cut diamonds, Elaine? With a laser. The Russian nuclear warhead, it did, however, slow the core down giving us some more time. Oh, well, how long? Let's see. 56 days now. But what about the thousands of meteors rocketing towards us? Those will arrive much sooner, I'm afraid. Do we know how big they are? A few appear to be in excess of 30 meters. The smaller ones will burn up in the atmosphere or will result in meteorite showers. May not be much warning in some cases. Well, we didn't have much of a warning with 2200QL jumping its orbit like we did. Hmm. Elaine, put together a list of the top metallurgical and geochemistry experts for me, please. Nikola, your daughter, Alexandra, is one of the foremost experts in both those occupations. So why not bring here on this project with you? No. Please put together that list. We don't have much time. Okay. Alexandra? Here. Hmm. That's an odd pattern, isn't it? That's what I was thinking. Seems like manmade chemical structure, not organic. You can actually see the discoloration if you look closely. Yeah. Hamari, get the data from 2016. Right away. Alexandra, your dad's assistant is asking me to call her again. Ignore it, Roland. It's just the usual three-month ploy to try to get me and dad to talk. Well, she did type "very important" in all caps this time, so she's yelling. And I'm saying, in all caps, "ignore it". Okay. Now she's texting me. Me too. That's it. Bring your phones up. Maybe it's important. What if your dad got hurt or the lab burned down? And if it was something that serious, she'd leave a message. Now come on. Bring them here. Alexandra, what are we? In kindergarten? Where we're going next, there's no phone reception anyway. We'll be cut off. Okay, back to work. We'll go at it another hour and then break for lunch. - Sound good? - Uh-huh. As he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings." And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? "There will not be left here, one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down." And his disciples asked him, "Tell us. "When will these things be? "And what will be the signs when all these things are about to be accomplished?" That time is now, everyone. Our time on earth draws near. That asteroid racing towards us is from God! It is God's divine will. It's a reason to rejoice, a time to be happy. But there are people, sinners! There are those who still attempt to fight God's will! We all heard about the Russians launching a nuclear weapon against the asteroid and all it did was break off the outer crust. Now we have hundreds of small meteors that will hit earth before the asteroid itself does! So instead of it all coming to one swift end like God had planned, for weeks we will suffer from meteor strikes that will cause unnecessary pain. That means it's time to wage war, a time to let God's will take its course! - Yeah! - Yeah! It's time to put an end to this Global Summit and their interference! Do you hear me? There are no other options that can be done besides using more nuclear weapons to stop 2200QL. The missile the Russians fired did in fact slow down the velocity of 2200QL. - General Quinn? - Mm-hm? There is an American ship out there in the same quadrant, yes? Yes. There's an Orion Deep Space Habitat in orbit a few thousand kilometers from Buran One. But it does not carry any ordnance. Perhaps we do not need ordnance. Explain. Kinetic impact. Kinetic impact? You mean maneuvering a spacecraft into the asteroid? We're not sacrificing the lives of American astronauts at this point, Mr. Turgenev. But if the Orion could rendezvous with the Buran to evacuate the cosmonauts, then the Buran could be navigated into impacting 2200QL. That kinetic impact could be enough to offset the asteroid's trajectory. Am I right? - Yes. - I say let's try it. Any objections from the nations on this proposal? What about the smaller meteorites headed for earth? What do we do about them? Nothing we can do about them from a militarily or technological aspect. It'd be too risky to take them out with a ballistic missile. They're moving too fast and many of them are likely to burn up in the atmosphere. Do we know where the first meteorites will strike? The Philippines will be among the first to encounter a substantial meteorite storm. A meteor of about 30 meters will hit off the coast of Chile, South America in an undeveloped part of the region. Australia, too, will be hit hard. But most of those impacts will happen in unpopulated regions of the Outback. We must also be vigilant regarding the residual effects of these impacts: possible tsunamis, changes to our ecosystem and destruction as well and changes to our climate. Make sure we all have the proper scientists allocated to these needs. Nikola? I've been going through these metallurgical experts' analysis. What are they teaching in learning institutions these days? It's an embarrassment! Did you trying reaching Alexandra? I've been trying. It just keeps ringing. Well, she must be somewhere where there's no cell reception. I know she's somewhere on the coast of Chile where NASA announced the next meteor storm will strike. She's actually in Chile? How do you know that? Well, I made a social media account years ago of a young man with tattoos who's an environmental activist. She accepted the request, so now I always have some idea where and what she's up to. How come you never told me that? Well, I thought you would consider that spying and you would not approve. No. You're her father. You're allowed to spy. Hmm. But she is a very smart girl and I'm sure she knows what's going on. I sincerely hope so. What's wrong? My father's been calling. Well, Elaine was texting all of us. Yeah, I know, Himari, but dad hasn't called me in over two years, not since I resigned from the Geo One project. Look, with what's going on in the world, maybe he's finally trying to make peace. You should, too. He's your father. Just check your messages. See what he said. What is it? The message kept breaking up. Something about the Russian's failed attempt trying to stop 2200QL. Meteor is headed for earth way ahead of schedule. Then I couldn't make out the rest. Just call him back. I will, but I want to get set up first. This is Buran One. We are slowing trajectory, turning off attitude Control and going to manual. Do you copy, Orion? Copy that. Take your time Buran One. Buran One, we are clear for you to dock. We are accelerating 800 meters off your port side, making corrections. Copy that. Buran One! Buran One! You have a fast-moving object headed towards you on the intercept course! You're about to get hit! We are aware, Orion. Taking evasive action. Orion, what is your position? Are you clear of the meteor? We are clear. Giving the engines a little bit of thrust to be sure. Worried about Buran One, though. Buran One! The first meteors start hitting earth today. Mass evacuations in the Philippines. When does the actual asteroid hit us? The big one? 46 days. Dad's calling again. You should answer. Must be really important if he's calling you this much. Get 'em going! Hello, Dad. Have you been following 2200QL? Nice to hear your voice, Dad. Yes, I've been following 2200QL. I imagine you're working on it. It's nice to hear your voice as well. There are things we should discuss. But at the moment, I think we have more pressing matters, hmm? You're breathing kind of heavy. Are you okay? There are meteors projected to land in your vicinity. A large one will strike offshore. Wait. You know where I am? Your social media. So you're saying we're in the impact zone? Are you sure? Yes. Smaller ones, those that don't burn up in the atmosphere, most are expected to fall offshore. But you know how the atmosphere can alter trajectory, huh? Why are you coughing like that? Are you sick? On the chance that some reach earth, I want you to study the fragments. I want you to find out the metallurgical composition and get it to me immediately. Of course, be vigilant. Seek cover. Okay. Yeah, I can do that. Are you okay? The first of the meteors should be landing any minute! Please, seek cover! Please call to let me know you're okay. Hey, guys, apparently we're in the impact zone. What? Looks like most of them are gonna hit offshore. But let's just get the equipment in the car and find somewhere to take shelter just in case. And if any of the meteorites hit land, my father wants us to take a metallurgical sample and send it to him. He's working on stopping the 2200QL. All right. Hey. How did it go? We don't really have time for this. But it was nice to talk to him. Same shit as always. He wants me to do all the legwork for him. And I'm sure he'll take all the credit and reap in the research grants. Maybe this time it'll be different. Given the world is at stake, it doesn't really matter this time anyway. Are we all loaded up? Let's go! - Get in! - No, no! They're coming in at an angle! If one of those things slams through the front or back windshield, you'll get cut to shreds with imploding glass! Get on the driver side of the car! Press yourself up against the car! Pull your knees in and cover your head. Hey, I think... I think it stopped already. That was quick. We got to move fast. Looks like one of those large meteorites hit just offshore. Might have displaced a hell of a lot of water. Come on buddy, let's go. Give me any firearm, I'll disassemble it and put it back together with my eyes closed. But this computer stuff is beyond me. Luckily, while you were a grunt, I was sitting in front of a computer at Cheyenne Mountain Complex all day. And to think how I used to beat up those Air Force boys on R&R in Germany. Luck for you I wasn't there. I would have kicked your ass. Okay... and... I am in. So what am I looking at? All right. You see this right here? Mm-hm. They're having issues with their propulsion for their Mars rocket project. And right here are the correspondents which are trying to correct it. So what I'm gonna do is delete them. Yeah, but can any IT expert just recover them? Yes, of course. That's why I slowed them down a bit. If I can keep causing these delays, maybe they'll miss their launch window and they'll run out of time. Let's see what other problems I can stir up. Mr. Chairman, sorry to interrupt, but I need a word with you in private. Of course. We'll discuss this further. Just give us a moment. What's going on, General? I just received word RRP Propulsions have a major breach. Information on the Mars rocket propulsion got wiped out. This can set them back a couple of days to recover the lost data. Hmm. RRP was the company selected by the Summit. Perhaps we should look elsewhere to get the Mars rocket up there? Yes, sir. Alexandra? Think we got enough? Let's grab a few more for ourselves. My hands are numb. Give me a minute. Hey! Anybody notice this? Notice what? You were right about the water displacement. The tide's gone out... way out. Grab everything... quick! - Tsunami? - Yes. Get everything to the car! Yeah. Guys, we need to hurry! - Let's go! - I'm on it! Faster! Go faster! Going as fast as I can, Hugo! Go that way! Hold on, hold on. Come on! Come on! How close is it? You don't wanna know! Keep driving! Go! Go! Go! We made it. Good job! Roland, pull off the road. Okay, stop the car. Wow. Looks like we're gonna be stuck here for a little bit 'til the waters recede. As soon as they do, we'll pack up and get out of here. I never thought I'd be so happy to hear you say that. It shouldn't take long. We should leave for the airport by evening. Hey, how is that hardness analysis looking, Roland? Whatever this carbon bond is, it makes Lonsdaleite look like tinfoil. I've never seen a geologic compound this strong, - so resistant to stress. - I know. There's no cleavage plains in any of the samples we took. And the chemical bonding of the different atoms is amazing. I don't think a disbursed source of energy like a nuclear weapon is gonna crack that core. It's gonna take a concentrated laser to break that asteroid apart and keep it from hitting earth. A very strong laser at that. I'm gonna call Dad, tell him that we're gonna be back in California tomorrow morning. And then we'll bring him his samples then. Guys, I cannot wait to get out of here. - You're telling me. - I feel the same way. I owe you guys an apology. I'm agoraphobic. I really freaked out when we were outside. Yeah, you were freaking out. It's all good, though. Don't tell Alexandra, please? You've reached Nikola. I'm unable to take your call. Alexandra? Hey, Elaine. I was just trying to call Dad, but it kept going straight to voice. I'm at the hospital with your father now. He's... he's very ill. How soon can you get here? Uh, well, we'll be in a plane in the next hour. We'll be back there tomorrow morning. Is that why he was coughing like that? What's going on? Yeah. He's, uh... He's been sick for several weeks. I'm gonna explain everything when you get here. But, please, please, just come quickly, okay? Okay, okay, yeah. We'll be there in the morning. What's the matter? Dad's in the hospital. What happened? I don't know. Figure it out when we get there. Let's check our plane. Let's go. Hey, Alex, how you doing? That was a stupid question. I'm okay. Thank you for everything you did. Where are we at with everything? Your father did complete a laser design and I think it's perfect to stop 2200QL. Nothing we can do to it to make it any better. He was thinking just like you were without even seeing samples of the asteroid. He was a brilliant man. Listen, take as much time as you need. I know this must be tough for you that you didn't get to say goodbye. Does it really matter how I feel? We don't have time to say anymore. Your father had also scheduled a meeting with the 2200QL summit for this week to give them his proposal. I know you hate big government, but this is bigger than that. Yeah. I'm not dumb, Himari. Roland, give Dad's design and laser schematics to Hugo. I wonder which of the private sector aeronautics companies might have any available rockets? Vanguard had a Copernicus rocket ready for us on that last satellite upgrade that got set back. They might still have it. It would be perfect for getting the laser up to the asteroid. That's right. Let's give them a call. Maybe we'll be in luck. Himari, confirm Dad's meeting with the Summit. Tell them what happened. Let them know that I'll be going there in his place. Right away. You knew how your Dad was. He didn't want you to be upset, especially when there wasn't anything that you or anybody could have done for him. Just let me know when you need something. Okay? Okay, thanks, Elaine. Given the complexity of the crystalline core of 2200QL, it's much too dense to try and stop with another nuclear missile. The carbon bonds holding the different metals together are too strong. A warhead disperses its energy. We need to pinpoint and concentrate a physical force to break the core apart. Furthermore, the asteroid's rotation and velocity are too great now to try and alter its trajectory using missiles, as well. I know that was brought up earlier. Yes? Wouldn't you agree that the previous nuclear blast has surely weakened the core, Ms. Svoboda? And that a second nuclear warhead would destroy it? It's a possibility, yes, a slim one at that. And I don't think we can afford not to entertain an alternative. Because if this fails, we don't have time for a third effort before impact. And this laser you propose, we're only 39 days away from the asteroid impacting the earth itself. How far out from production is it? Well, we haven't actually started building it yet. But we've been analyzing the metallurgical structure of the samples we took in the field, and... We are less than two weeks away from launching another nuclear weapon. I get that, but it won't take that long to build this laser, two weeks at most. What's important is to decipher what it's gonna take to blow this thing apart. And my concern is that another nuclear weapon is going to fail just like the first attempt. And I understand your point, but the Mars X1 has over twice the payload capacity of our first effort! Sir! I am one of the leading metallurgical experts and geochemists in the world! And I'm telling you that a nuclear... Don't make the mistake of judging me based on my appearance! Ignorance can be a real bitch! Ms. Svoboda... first, our sincere condolences on the loss of your father. He was a great man, great scientist and innovator. The world is a better place because of him. We greatly appreciate you coming here and sharing your findings with us. My thought is we continue our path. You do what you feel is necessary. And, hopefully, between all of our concentrated efforts, we can stop this thing together. Listen... We're wasting time! Very well. Thank you for your time. Good luck. With your permission, I'd like to give DOD and NASA the go ahead to outfit Mars X1 with their own propulsion unit. There's too many cooks in the kitchen, not to mention we're running out of time. RRP continues to have security breaches. Do it, but... keep the DOD and NASA's singular effort off the radar. Yes, sir. With the protective shield nearly in place, we are minutes away from commencing the Teloch laser limited capacity beta test. I've managed to make a replica of the 2200QL's core based off actual samples and elements most closely related to the alien carbon compound. Granted, the composition is not entirely accurate, but hopefully close enough to conduct our studies. I'm using deuterium fluoride in this first trial. Did you get all that, Elaine? Yes, of course. Sorry. Himari, start at 300 kilowatts and a 7.5 millimeter beam. Again, the subject material is composed primarily from nickel and iron. For spite, don't put that in there. I'm calling it Svobodium Carbonate. The proposed protocol is to take the laser up by rocket, attach it to one of our larger satellite, model Aristotle, and attempt to destroy 2200QL. - Boom. - We got it. Goggles on, everyone. Here we go... Three, two, one. Going to static beam. Increasing to 500 kilowatts and decreasing to a five millimeter beam... And we're clear. Intermittent attempts failed. However, a concentrated beam began to penetrate the surface at 300 kilowatts at 7.5 millimeters. When increased to 500 kilowatts and decreased to a five millimeter beam, the penetration was deeper. But at the cost of the housing structural integrity which is composed of a tungsten composite. Okay, we have two options here. We could either reinforce the density and composition of the housing or... we use titanium doped sapphire for the laser energy source, decision dependent on time frame, availability and expectancy of the materials delivered. Alexandra, I don't think TiDS would even scratch the surface of this. Take a look. You're right. Scratch that about the sapphire, Elaine. We're gonna have to stay with the deuterium fluoride. But, on the day, we're going to do 10 peta-watts of energy at that thing. So we need to construct a housing that can withstand that kind of heat. And not be too heavy to be held by our satellites. What about tantalum carbide? A ceramic. Good call, Hugo. Himari? I believe we have everything to start work on the laser: optics, network, all that. All we need is the tantalum for the housing, correct? Yes. We have everything to begin laser construction. And we have a Copernicus rocket on standby at Vanguard from that fluorocarbon mission that we canceled. Hugo, start designing a housing with tantalum specs. Himari, you and I are gonna be working on the optics. Roland, I need you to find the closest and most expedient purveyor of tantalum carbide and get it here ASAP. I don't care what the cost. I'll pay for it. We're really cutting it close on this thing, guys. Mr. Chairman, NASA has issued a correction on the next meteor showers. Southern tip of Alaska and the Bering Sea remain constant. However, a stretch over Wyoming and Utah has changed. The spread is now from Utah to Nevada. When is impact? Within the hour. FEMA and the State Department, of course, have been notified, correct? As we speak, sir. Warnings are being issued to stay inside. Stay inside? The meteorites the fall over Utah will be about the size of baseballs. The authorities have determined it's safer to remain inside than to be out in the streets. Plus the storm should last only a few minutes. In Nevada, some of the meteorites will be larger. Again, it's been determined it's safer to remain inside. The larger meteorites are projected to land somewhere outside the Las Vegas city limits. This is an urgent message from the Emergency Broadcast System. There has been a change in today's meteor location strike zones. Previous warnings were given for strike zones extending from Wyoming to Utah. Revised strike zone is Utah to Nevada. We say again, Utah to Nevada. Yo, we just lost our tantalum carbide shipment! What? Steve got caught in a meteor storm in Nevada. He's dead! What? We lost our shipment? Who's Steve? Steven Hollander, Alexandra, head of our transpo and our lead truck driver. He was driving the truck. Did Mr. Hollander have a family? Kids? Yeah. He had all of those. Okay. Offer our condolences and see what we can do, whatever they need. Roland, can you see if maybe we can have another order? That supplier's out. They sent us everything they had on that last truck. Next distributor is on the east coast. Call them, please? Got it. Hugo, I want you to figure out every angle you can in the event that we can stay with the tungsten housing for the laser. Gotcha. Everyone? Everyone, may I have your attention? I've been notified that the United States Defense Department in association with NASA and the National Nuclear Security Administration have achieved a propulsion unit that's capable of delivering the Mars X1, a 15 megaton rocket. It's scheduled to launch in the next 48 hours. America has done exactly what you opposed Russia of doing! I realize that. Acting alone without the Summit's consent! I realize that! And I still want the Summit to continue its work in the event this effort too shall fail! But time is critical! In fact, if any of the other countries feel that they have a propulsion engine capable of delivering a warhead right now, do it! Yes? What is it, Laura? I'm sorry to bother you here. But I have some new information I think you'd like to know. I'm sure I told you my parents died in this house during a fire when I was a young boy. You did mention that to me. And I'm sorry. That's terrible. It was a test of faith, but certainly nothing I could compare to the trials of Job. What do you have to report? We might have a new player in the private sector. Really? Who? Svoboda Enterprises. Nikola Svoboda, the famous scientist that recently passed. His daughter is taking over now. She went to the 2200QL Summit, offered her help and was turned away. I wonder why. You seen what she looks like? She's one of those Occupy Market Street vegan hipsters with piercings all over. Reports say that she wasn't too well received. Do we know if she'll try to pursue to stop the asteroid on her own? That's the question. Well, beside her Bohemian act, do we know anything else bout this girl's religious faith? Well, I couldn't find anything. Dig in the Svoboda's networks. Find out what they're up to. I'll do some research on her. Maybe she's one to listen to reason, for all we know. Hey, guys! The NASA broadcast on the Mars X1 rocket already started. Why don't you have it on? How much do you want to bet that as soon as this fails to stop the asteroid, someone will be calling us? Maybe it'll work. It's not gonna work. Have you ever had to use that stuff for real? Once, when I was 17. What happened? He didn't know the word "no". What did you do to him? Here we go. Mars guidance has converged. TC is looking good. Thrusters at full. Axes are good. We are a GO. Warhead is engaged. 2200QL contact minus eight minutes. I say again, we are a GO. Warhead is engaged. 2200QL contact minus eight minutes. NASA's Mars X1 rocket is racing towards 2200QL's core. Time of impact is in the next several minutes. We, and all the inhabitants of Earth can only wait and pray that this attempt will destroy the asteroid headed for us, once and for all, before it strikes earth in less than 30 days. God help us all. SAR is picking up some heavy interference. Entering Meteor Path. Retrorockets engaged. Stand by. I trust structurally reinforcements have been made for this so it doesn't detonate prematurely? They have, sir. It'll be fine. Whew, close one, everybody. Resume standard trajectory. Thrusters engaged. Axes looking good. All right, here we go. We are minus 60 seconds from contact. We are minus 60 seconds from contact. Holding steady. Contact successful. Pull it back up! Mars X1. Do we have visual confirmation the target was destroyed? I repeat. Do we have visual confirmation that the target was destroyed? SAR reading no change in 2200QL composition. I say again, no change in 2200QL composition. Now what do we do? Everyone, please! Even though the Mars X1 didn't destroy the asteroid as planned, there's an outstanding chance we've changed the trajectory. Well, what if it hasn't? What if nuclear weapons won't stop it? Call the girl! Svoboda's child. Call her. Mr. Chairman? Pleasance? I think we need to consider bringing Alexandra Svoboda back. We studied those samples we got from her and that nuke still didn't break the asteroid up. Maybe we should wait and listen to what she has to say this time, hmm? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. Please call her. - Go on. - What? This is the first time she's probably slept in days. Let's give her a little more time, what do you say? And suffer her wrath when she finds out we didn't tell her immediately? Yeah, no thanks. Hey, what time is it? A little after eight. A.M. Crap. I must have fallen asleep. It's understandable. What? What's going on? I know those looks. Somehow the orders for the tantalum carbide got canceled. What? What do you mean? How did it get canceled? I got an email saying the orders were canceled. They had our authorization code. How's this possible? We don't know. We've been working on this for the last half hour. That makes no sense. Well, place another order while we figure out what happened! Our assets are frozen somehow. What? How are our assets frozen? We have no idea. We don't know what's going on. The bank representative we spoke to said it had something to do with the Patriot Act. But Elaine put a call in to our attorney. We're not terrorists! We know, Alexandra. Please don't yell. This is ridiculous. Elaine, you're in contact with the lawyers? Yeah, I am. What? What haven't you told me? The Summit called also. Now they want your help. Well, they can kiss my ass! You sure about that? Because I'm willing to bet they have plenty of tantalum carbide. Then we go with tungsten! I'm not working with the government. They'll only slow us down or try to micromanage us. We don't have time for their bullshit. You all went with me to the Summit! It's chaotic! No one knows what they're doing over there! There's no time! Hugo, see if we can reinforce the housing with tungsten. And follow up with Vanguard to confirm the Copernicus rocket is prepped and ready to transport our Teloch laser to the Aristotle. You got it. Himari, make coffee. Do something. Let's get to work! They want our help? They can go screw themselves. These religious cults are everywhere. Freaks! Did you consider what they were saying? No. Are you crazy? I've got the nearest Aristotle satellite moving into position. How's the coding? Almost done. - Alexandra? - Yes? I just want to tell you that the attorneys are still trying to figure out what's going on with our assets. Okay. Thanks, Elaine. How's it coming? We're doing fine. We managed to get the weight down on the fuel cell. And Hugo's working on the housing. Huh. Is it just me or has she been acting a little strange the last few weeks? I don't know. With my dad passing and everything, she's taken it kinda hard. She worked for him for years. Doesn't she have all the access codes? Yeah. She has more access and knows more about the company than I do. She was dad's right hand. You think she might have had something to do with the order cancel and the frozen assets? Why would she do that? She worked for him for years. I don't know. Just a thought. Where are you going? Restroom. Alexandra? Yeah. How you doing, Trey? I'm all right. I'm just surprised to hear from you. Yeah. I know, I know. But, hey, listen. I've got some kind of a breach in my network. Think you could come over and take a look? I'll pay you for your time... well, when our assets are unfrozen. Your assets are frozen? It's part of the problem. I'll explain when you get here. Can you come quickly? Sure, sure. I'll be right over. Okay, thanks Trey. No problem. Look, look! The Chinese have almost prepared another missile... No, no, no! No more missiles! This is a waste of everyone's time. What about Svoboda's daughter? She turned us down. You should have accepted her help the first time. She has informed us, however, that she and her team are working on a laser. And why have we not worked on a laser? Because the Global Treaty passed two years ago that put a stop to laser development for weaponization, a treaty I was never in favor of. However, no government or facility has all the necessary materials to currently build such a weapon in the short amount of time we have left. Then perhaps we should be offering her assistance. So, um, are you seeing anybody? Seriously? I mean, I just thought I'd ask. I mean, I haven't seen anybody since we broke up. Neither have I. But I'm a little busy trying to save the earth from an asteroid, so focus. All right. Now lucky for you, your server's located here onsite. And I found who logged in and sent off the email of canceling your order. You know, they did a pretty good job trying to erase their signature. You know, they almost missed it. I also found a trace from the same person alerting to the State Department some terroristic activities. I mean, you know, that is what got your assets canceled. Oh, wow. Okay. Wait. Are you sure that's right? Yeah. Look right here. Look at the login. Sorry, Alex. What do I owe you? Oh, nothing. I'm just happy to help. Are you sure? Yeah, definitely. You're not gonna come back later and say that I owe you anything? Alex, have a little faith in humanity, okay? I'm not gonna do that, all right? And I made this for you. What is this? It's a manual override in case your servers gets attacked or anything. Oh. Thank you. No problem. Alexandra's calling me. Hello? Hey, where are you right now? Hugo and I are in the power room. We had to reroute some stuff to work on Teloch One's heat shielding dynamics. Is anybody with you right now? No. Just the two of us. Why? What's up? Quick. I need you two to come to the office as soon as you can. And don't say anything to anyone else. Understood? Okay. What was that about? I don't know. She wants us to come to her place. Thought I'd find you here. Hey, guys, what's up? Why? Why what? The stupid thing to do would have been to try to sabotage Teloch. But to suggest that Elaine was behind the most recent problems? Well, that wasn't too smart either. What are you talking about? If I was smarter, I would realize that you had known me since I was young. You knew the name of the first boy that I kissed, my favorite stuffed animal, my favorite toys, my favorite numbers, colors, the things that my dad didn't even know. You knew. And had I been smarter, I would have realized that if anybody knew any of the pass codes, that it would have been you. Why, Himari? I looked after you your whole life. And you treated me like your babysitter or your maid. I grew up watching your narcissistic father brag about what a great man he was and all of the things he'd done. You used to bitch that you didn't want to be anything like him! Well, guess what? You are exactly like him! Any time you and your father did anything, the primary focus was to feel your own self-importance. Neither of you really cared how anyone felt or what they believed or what they wanted. It was always only about what you two wanted and what you two believed. Let's take a look at you right now, huh? Are you just busting your ass building this laser to save the world or to make yourself feel important? Did you shun the Summit to show them like all your other bullshit activism at the cost, Alexandra, of the entire world being wiped out? What are the real reasons? Maybe this was a final "F you" to your dad because you resent him? For being so embarrassed with your ridiculous appearance when you guys were working on Geo One? Which, by the way, was the real reason that he kept you out of the spotlight for all of your hard work on that project. That truth hurts, doesn't it? But you know why I did it? It wasn't about you... and I know that crushes you. I've read that email from Divine Will and I reached out to them. And they listened to me and I listened to them. I think they're right. This world has run its course. You always said that we were destroying the earth. And I've always agreed with you about that. So why not let God destroy what He created? This gentleman is going to take you to clear your office. You can leave your key card on my desk. Sure thing, boss. Elaine, are you still in contact with our lawyers? Yeah. It's still gonna be a while until our assets are unfrozen. There still needs to be an official investigation looking into the accusations, so... Hugo? Can we stay with the tungsten for housing? I've done what I can. Okay. Let's get ready to launch. Svoboda, this is Vanguard. I'll be with you until we get the Copernicus docked with the Aristotle. You are loud and clear, Vanguard. Thank you for your help today. The pleasure is mine. Copernicus has established orbit. Rocket booster confirmed for orbital coast. Rocket booster confirmed for orbital coast, copy. Hey, Vanguard, this is Svoboda. I'm detecting a Delta azimuth in our area. Can you confirm? Good catch on your end, Svoboda. Delta azimuth correction is negative 0.11. Correction is negative 0.11. Suggest we do L32 alignment with consent. Affirmative. You are go for L32 alignment detecting angle 0.11. All righty. We'll get that handled for you folks pronto. Thrusters are looking good to us. All axes are firing. Would you like us to copy alignment results? He doesn't need to, I got them. Sending them over to you now. Roger that, Svoboda. Time of periapsis passage is minus 120. Read back correct. It's all you from here on out, Vanguard. We're just spectators. Copy that, Svoboda. You're in good hands. We'll get your Teloch laser gun docked on to the Aristotle momentarily. Then hand it back over to you guys. Alexandra, these guys are good. They loaded all the equipment onto the Artemis series. Never had a problem. Copernicus velocity vector is minus 39, plus 15, 38, 76. Engaging Aristotle. PYRO looking good. Okay, Svoboda, we're going to let the ACS take it from here. And in layman's terms, we're turning on the lights. Okay, Svoboda, check your downlink for me. We're all good down here, Vanguard. Downlink established and operational. All right. It's been a pleasure working with you guys again. Good luck. Vanguard out. Moment of truth, guys. Roland, I'm gonna need you to monitor the depth of penetration of 2200QL. Copy that. Hugo, I need you to keep an eye on Teloch's structural integrity of the housing. Got it. Maneuvering Teloch to LAT 32, 56, 318. Angle of attack is minus 32, 56, 318. Target acquired and locked on. Firing up transducer. Goodnight, sucker! What'd you do? I cut off their connection network so they can't monitor what I'm about to do. Which is? Gonna throw in a virus. It's gonna crash their whole server. It's gonna take them days to fix this damage. What happened? I don't know! Somebody step on a power grid? Or pull a loose cable with their feet? Nothing's rebooting! Where's the network manual? Come on! What is this? Wait, wait, wait! Look, look! Tray gave me this. Where is it... Where is it? What is it? Just in case we had any other issues. Back up! Phew! We've been breached! - What? - Someone's hacking our server! No, no, no, no. Can you stop it? Hold on. Good work. Damn, this guy's good. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Phew! Lucky you had that or we would have been toast. I've been kicked out. What happened? They rebooted the whole server. How did they do this so fast? They must have some jump drive or some genius IT guy. Wait, so that's it? Yeah. I'm sorry, Malachi. It's okay. Just means we have to be more resourceful. All right. We're good to go again. Power source at optimum level, no ullage. We're ready to fire. We're going to start with a 10-meter spread at eight peta-watts. - Alexandra? - Yes? Would you consider going live for this? Or at least a radio broadcast? I think the people would really like to listen in, especially the Summit. Well, how long is that gonna take? Press of a button. I've already established the link and sent it to Chairman Pleasance, so Svoboda's website is hot to relay. I can see why my dad adored you. Sure, go ahead. Yes! You ready, guys? - Roger. - Roger that! Here we go. Contact! We have contact! At minus 32, 56, 318! Direct in dead center on its axis. Come on, you mother f'er. Zero penetration, no change in hardness. Give it some time, Roland. Hugo, how's thermal? Uh, you can crank it up a little. Structural integrity is fine. Not even a dent. Good job. We got penetration! Yes! We got minus 32, 56, 318, approximate rate of five meters per second. It's working! It's working! Rate of penetration is slowing substantially. Hugo, what's my thermal reading? You're good to crank it up! Okay. We're dropping to 7.5 meter beam. And increasing to 10 peta-watts. Uh, here's where it might get dicey! Okay, looks like the rate of penetration has stabilized. Uh, Roland? We got a delineation on the axis. And from what I can tell, it's slowing down substantially. I see it. Compensating! We're back on axis, but penetration is slow again. Let's drop it down to a five-meter beam and up to 11 peta-watts. What's the problem? I'm worried it's not gonna break up. Explain! It's like spinning a basketball on your finger. The harder you slap it, the faster it's gonna spin. Asteroid is not spinning on its axis, Roland! But I'm worried it will. You hit it harder, it's gonna speed up in velocity and possibly hit here faster if we don't destroy it. Or the centrifugal force puts it in another trajectory and misses earth entirely... if we don't break it up. Decreasing beam to five-meter spread, increasing to 12 peta-watts. I don't know if thermals can handle... Is it starting to spin again? It's negligible. Let's give it a little longer. What? Thermal venting is starting to fail! Yeah, I get that, but this isn't working! Making correction on delineation. Holding at 12 peta-watts. We gotta stop this thing, guys. Yeah, I get that, but this is not working! Thermal shields are failing now! Why don't we get Teloch Two up there? We can get two lasers from opposing sides! Counter 2200QL's inertia, try and keep it from spinning! Its structural integrity is failing now! Just a few more seconds! Hold your horses! Shit! Try to reacquire lock! It's not gonna make any difference, Alexandra! Teloch is burning up! I've got it! I've got a lock! - Wait, wait! - Alexandra, don't! Quiet! Please, everyone. We have three days left until 2200QL will strike earth. Many of your countries began to build or refurbish underground bomb shelters or establishments when this began a few weeks ago. Now is the time to decide who you'll take to these possible sanctuaries and the time to spend with loved ones. I am declaring 2200QL Summit is dissolved immediately. Thank you for all you have done, and God speed. What's the breakdown of the 50,000? Okay. Those selected will be notified in the next few hours. 30% will be 18 years younger. 45%, 19 to 55 years old. A predominant number being physicians, scientists, engineers, those of importance we cannot do without. The last 25% will be allotted to ages 56 and up. All will be picked up and taken by military escort at 0:300 hours to established sanctuaries. What about those in government office? In the last grouping? With the exception of the President, his wife and the Cabinet, everyone else is Lotto. And the Global Summit is not part of the Cabinet. Sorry, sir. Oh, don't worry. You know, I've always been lucky at life. Maybe I'll be joining you. Yes, sir. I hope so. Okay. If we're going to use Teloch Two from earth, one of our biggest issues is gonna be to compensate for the ambient conditions, the pressure and temperature change in our atmosphere. We're gonna need to calibrate our target acquisition software and bounce it off our Calypso satellite, since the Aristotle is now wasted. We're also gonna have to take in consideration any meteorites that might further distress satellite to Teloch relay. And the coup de grace is the fuel cell. That's just going to be dangerous. So I propose that we move that out in the middle of the desert, away from life, and coordinate from there. But why don't we just get another rocket carrier from somewhere? Attach Teloch Two to the Calypso and try again? Because Teloch Two is gonna be at 20 peta-watts. That's way too much equipment for any of our carriers to get up to our satellites. - 20 Peta-watts? - Yes. We can't gamble any more. We don't have time. The fuel source itself would be enough to destroy several city blocks. That's why we're taking this sucker the hell out of the city. But if you can't make a housing to contain a 12 peta-watt laser, how are you gonna manage almost twice that? Hugo is working on that. It's gonna work this time. Trust me. It has to. Great. Let them in. Send them over to Lab 1. Trucks here. Great. Hugo, everything else is already onsite? Everything should be there this afternoon. All right. Let's grab our gear. Get ready to hit the road the second Teloch Two is loaded up. Let's go. Are you sure you want to do this alone? Can you bring some of your men with you? Ah, I need my best people here preparing everyone for the end of days. Look, we shared some great battles and victories. This one's got to be a solo mission. You understand? Of course. Until Valhalla. God be with you. I'll see you soon. Take a right up here. Where? Right up here by the cactus. Cactus? By the cactus. Up here. We're gonna be going off-roading for a little bit. I didn't even know this place existed. Well, very few people do. Hey, Elaine, do you have your phone? Yeah, I have it. Let's document this for the world. People should know that we haven't given up. We're going to stop this thing. Sure thing. All right. With just a just a little over 36 hours until 2200QL is scheduled to collide with the earth, Alexandra Svoboda is in the process of updating the software on our Calypso satellite. Now this will enable her to communicate... Uh, Elaine? Please do me a favor. Yeah? Say "we" for everything. Huh? We are in the process of uploading the software. This will enable us to communicate with the Calypso satellite. Stress the team. Please don't make this about me. Okay, yeah. I'll start over. I've got the downlink established. Calypso is in position. How's that fuel cell coming along? Reference detector is still giving me some problems. 20 peta-watts? What do you expect? I expect you to make it work, like you always do. Hugo, how are you doing? The same as Roland. I don't think these anodes are gonna be able to hold up under the thermal displacement. Everything's gonna work out, guys. We can do this. How much more time do you need? Another hour or so to be safe. We're only gonna have one shot at this. Yeah, I know. Hey, Laura, I'm on my way back. Hey, I have some important information for you. Alexandra is documenting her every move on social media! From where? They weren't at the Costa Mesa complex. No, they're not there. A lot of people don't know this, but on Twitter, if you don't disable it, it shows exactly where your geographical location is. I'm going to send you the coordinates now. Just got 'em! Do you think you can make it? The asteroid's gonna hit in two hours. Yeah, I'll just make it. Thank you, Laura. I'll see you on the other side. Make us proud, Malachi. Laura out. Hello, guys. They're expecting a meteorite shower in the next several minutes. Thanks, Elaine. Let's get everything to the warehouse, quick. Go! What the... my Lincoln! It looks like it went through the apocalypse. We got the Lincoln when we got the lab. Move! What's this? Your Lotto tickets. In case this doesn't work, we still got 30 hours to make it. What are the odds all four of us got chosen? People will sell their souls for the right price. But Svoboda's assets are still frozen and there's only three here. I took it out of my money. Look, it's not important right now. Alexandra, take mine. The world will need you more than me. Knock it off! Thank you, Elaine. But we don't have time for this. Roland? Please let this work. We're good to go. Wait... The downlink's not established! What the f... Come on, Roland! What is it? Hold on. Okay, it looks like it's on our end because there's nothing wrong with the Calypso. The meteorite shower must have messed with the wavelength. But, yeah, yeah... it's Teloch. Something's messed with the satellite array. Must've gotten moved during the meteor shower. Stop! I'll do it. I need you here. Once that downlink is back up, fire it! Wait. Let me go with you! No. Stay here in case Roland needs you. The downlink is up. Do it! Now! Before anything else goes wrong! Yes! We've got penetration! Whoo-hoo! Shut it down! What? Miss Svoboda, shut it down now! You're crazy! I'm not shutting it down! We're trying to destroy QL! I can't let you do this! Shut it down! Stop it! Let go! Hey! Hey! Oh, God! Jesus! Ah! I didn't wanna have to do that. Now get up. God has a plan for us, Miss Svoboda. It's not up to us to alter that plan. You cannot destroy 2200QL. It's God's divine will! Now get up. You're that religious freak! Get up! I said get up! What? What was that? That thing you're staring at? It's a million dust particles from us blowing the crap out of that asteroid. No. No! It can't be! Should have studied more astronomy, asshole. Oh! - Alexandra! - Are you okay? It worked! Oh, wow. We knew it worked from the downlink. But we didn't expect it to look like that. Ladies and gentlemen... Uh, to quote a great scientist: "Ignorance can be a real bitch." But in all seriousness, if we've learned anything from this, we've learned that indeed one's physical appearance certainly does not factor into their intelligence. So now I'm gonna turn this over to Miss Alexandra Svoboda so she can explain how she destroyed 2200QL. Miss Svoboda? What are you guys doing? Come on. Come on! Thank you, Mr. Chairman. But before I start, I'd like to make one important correction. I did not save the world. My team and I saved the world, all of us equally. We all did our part in this. Without us working together as a team, we wouldn't be here today. Aw...
