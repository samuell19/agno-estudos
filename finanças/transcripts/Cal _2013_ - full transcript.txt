- [Voiceover] Further rioting took place across the globe last night on the eve of another crisis summit of the G20. Experts are estimating that worldwide to date, the civil dissent has caused in excess of 26 billion dollars worth of damage to public buildings, lost tourism and public sector strikes. Here in the UK, the Metropolitan Police are putting costs for police overtime in the last six months at over 40 million pounds. When challenged by the opposition leader to put a price on the riots in England, the Prime Minister suggested that the violence seen in the UK was contained and not comparable to other countries where lawlessness and government corruption and financial irresponsibility has recently come to light. Political analysts saw this as a direct comment on the unearthing of financial anomalies on the levels of debt concealed by some European administrations following the withdrawal from the Euro by both Greece and Portugal. As has become the norm of late, no government minister was prepared to come on the program this morning to discuss the situation. The chancellor will be making a statement to the House later today, ahead of the second emergency budget that he will be presenting to the Commons next week. The pressure is on him to reverse what some consider to be pecuniary cuts in public services that have seen waiting list increase in hospitals across England, schools having to lay off much-needed classroom assistants, and fire and rescue services holding fundraising events to pay for vital equipment and... (music drowns out voice) (seagulls shrieking) ♫ Travel makes my heart alive (ship horn blows) ♫ But repetition just isn't a life ♫ Welcome to the home you don't know ♫ Cracks caving in we've gotta go ♫ Share what's left (car engine hums) (muffled woman's voice speaking over intercom) ♫ When you dive you've gotta swim ♫ When you don't need anything (train hums) (wheels rumble) ♫ Oh my love all my love ♫ Oh my love the my love ♫ Oh my love oh I love ♫ Hold the front line ♫ Support the side ♫ Don't let them sneak up behind ♫ 'Cause when you fight you've gotta win ♫ When you fight you've gotta win ♫ But you don't owe anything ♫ - [Voiceover] Following the tax cuts made in the last budget. Tax cuts seen by many as a hand out to rich bankers and businessmen, many of whom continue to enjoy... (truck motor rumbles) (baby crying) (siren blares) (knock at door) To repay to the taxpayer the cost of the construction of Olympic Stadium after it was revealed that it acquired a 25 year lease-- - Cal! Fucking hell, Cal, you little nancy boy, 'bout bloody time! You got my message then? Oh, you could've killed me with your surprise entrance. Your mum being ill has near but fucking killed me. I could kill ya. Come here, oh! Why, handsome man, look at ya! Put you bag down, settle in, settle in. I'm so glad you're here. It's been so hard traipsing up to see your mum, give her the news you know, cheer her up, you know, anyway. Yeah, all this travelling, where'd you go to? You just up and left, didn't ya? And you got no boyfriend in tow. Ain't you a good'n after all she put you through. She ain't got long now, you know. I reckon you just got here in time. She don't know you're coming, it was my idea, see. Proper hard times, it is. You got any money on ya? (bottle sloshes) You might qualify for a funeral loan. Have you thought about that? I mean, what are you gonna do? What am I gonna do? I'm just a lodger here, see. I ain't got nowhere to go but I've been part of the family. Brought you up, didn't I? When she went inside. Do you think the counselor would give me the house? I mean, sittin' tenant-like. It don't seem right goes to some foreign family. Know what I mean? Lots of memories here. (helicopter blades chop) (car alarm blares) (man yelling indistinctly) (heart monitor beeping) - Who are you? - Her son. How's she doing? - Comfortable, she never mentioned you. - Did she do these? - Yeah, she works on them every day. Visiting time's over, I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave. (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] What jobs have you found for this week? - [Voiceover] I found the one but when I got there, the job was taken. (keyboard clicking) - So, my colleague tells me you're here to sign on. I've got a few questions first to see if we have any suitable positions available. Do you have any ID? (sighs) - I looked at the boards and stuff. Didn't see nothin', no jobs. (pecking keyboard loudly) - Well, let's remain positive for now, shall we? What age are you? - 21. - Any qualifications? - No. (phone ringing) - And where have you been working? - Travelling Europe, working in kitchens and stuff. - Kitchen help or cooking? - Anything I could find. - And how long have you been doing this? - About three years? - Do you have any proof of employment history? - [Cal] Not on me. - Well, without this information, it might affect your claim. We need proof of your having been displaced if we're to proceed. Any claim might be effected if you took yourself out of a job. - Look, I came in because my mum's in the hospital. I am looking for work but I need help with rent and stuff whilst I'm here. I've only got a few quid left and I'll need food on that. - Where are you staying? - At my mum's. Can I get any help? - (sighs) Would you say that you are her carer? - No, she's in hospital. Look, can I make a claim? (phone ringing) (paper rattling) (loud clatter) (coins clink) (traffic passing) (wheelchair whirs) (sorrowful piano music) (clock ticking) (coins clink) (steady, low quiet beating) (mumbling under breath) (panting) (labored breathing) - [Jane] I just drop it. - What the fuck? - [Jane] I ain't had it for ages. - [Cal] Get off me! I said get off me. I said get off me you drunk cow. - [Jane] Oh so what, you're through? You want a good time, don't ya? (door slams) I taught you how, I'll screw you straight. Your mum (muffled yelling) (laughing loudly, mumbling) (somber music) (beeping, humming) - There is a phenomenon spreading across the UK. Occupancy. We first saw it in Athens, then Spain with rapid growth across America and 80 countries around the world. Now here in Bristol, we have a group of protesters threatening to occupy the college green. The general thrust of their protest is to highlight job prospects with the focus of responsibility firmly on the shoulders of corporate greed and financial mismanagement by government. And banks bailed out by the taxpayer. The general feel here is peaceful. But there's a sense that events could rapidly escalate. - This is absolutely ridiculous. I find that I just wanna go downtown and I wanna give them a good piece of my mind. This is absolutely evil. - So your benefit has been cut. - Yes, my benefit's been cut. I used to get a hundred pound a week and now it's dropped down to 20 pound a week. I'm thinking, "How am I gonna cope? "I'm feeding a baby, I'll just take more medication." I can't, it's just impossible. (dynamic rock music) (crowd murmurs) (footsteps) (peaceful music) - [Ivan] Do you understand? (high pitched yell) Shut up, I tell you. Don't be such a crybaby. Do you hear me? I own you, boy. I own-- (boy crying) - [Jason] Please. - [Ivan] You can fuck me, just you fuck me. (yelling in pain) - Oi! - Piss off, there's nothing to see here. - Leave him alone. - I said there's nothing to see here. - I said leave him alone. - You what? (panting) (grunting loudly) This is now mine. - [Jason] Just leave it. - For fuck's sake! My fucking passport! Oi! (swift footsteps) (car doors slam) (knocking on glass) - You uh, buy this back? - [Cal] Just give it back. - [Ivan] Get in. (car starts) (rustling fabric, paper) (car humming) (parking brake grinds) - No extra charge, you have two cocks to play with today, enjoy. - I love cocksuckers. I love capitalism. Killed communism and now it's killing me with its generosity. Jason, take him and give our regular a bonus today, huh? - [Girl] Look after this for me, will you? (doors slam) (keys jingle) (car engine starts) - [Cal] It's the bloody door. Open the fucking door! (car races) (horn blows) (siren howls) (sighs) - Where's Cal? - I thought you said you didn't want him anywhere near. - I don't want him to see me. Not like this, that's all. - Course not, credit me, Cath. (church bells ring) (moaning, panting) - Whee! (laughing) (coughing) (car roars) (chiming music tolls) (rebellious rock beat) (hooves clop) (fire crackles) (indistinct bullhorn voices) (siren wails) (helicopter blades chop) (footsteps echo) (dog barking) (hinges squeak) (metal door slams) - Where's that bloke? - Ivan, I don't know where he lives. - You've got to get me my passport back. - How? Why don't you go get us some drinks with that? (sirens wail) (glass breaks) (loud knocking) (explosion) (cigarette crackling) (urgent footsteps) - Careful, mate, filth's up there - [Shopkeeper] No hoodies, let me see your face. (sirens wailing) (crowds talking) (urgently whispering at once) (yelling at once) - Hello, Sweetheart. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry (crying) - You fucking scumbag. (slow, sorrowful music) (yelling at once) - Where's my sister? - What are you talking about? - My sister! - 7.43 and some ID, please? (door squeaks) (siren wails) - (panting) I need plasters and a first aid kit. (loud chanting) - I said I need some ID please. - Report that a fire engine was attacked earlier as it was trying to attend a building reportedly a squat which had been set on fire deliberately. The flash point for tonight's violence appears to be centered on one particular supermarket chain. And footage sent to IBN earlier this evening clearly shows at one point the police losing control of the situation. Well, what's not going down very well are the comments made by the Prime Minister yesterday, describing these protesters as nothing more than... (loud rioting overtakes newscast) It's not the place of millionaire politicians to criticize those on the front line of the cuts. This is Phil Trope, IBN, back to you in the studio. (loud crashing) (crying) - Hello, found 'em. Let's fuck this place up. (banging, yelling) (slow, peaceful music) (plaster crumbling) (glass breaking) (laughing) - Get the fuck outta there! We should go. - (sighs) We can't. They took his drugs. He's gonna kill me. I'm fucked. (helicopter chopping) (sirens blare) (phone vibrates) - That cunt's really missing you. - He's gonna kill me. (door shuts) (rattles handle) - What's your story, then? - It's nothing special. What about yours? I used to study drama. My student loan hadn't come through. And I got behind on rent. So my landlord introduced me to Ivan. One introduction later, I had my rent paid and my cock sucked, it was easy. - Why didn't you ask your parents for help? - I couldn't, my dad just lost his job and they're going through having the house repossessed. Anyway, the next rent came due and Ivan appeared again. This time the punk was gross. I said I couldn't. So he softened me up with some charlie. And that's it. I'm a cliche now, thrown off my course. My parents won't talk to me. I mean, there's worse things I could be doing. I could be marking old ladies. What about yours? Come on, tell me something. What's your favorite color? I'm gonna guess blue. 'Cause you look a little down today. - It's been a fucked up day. - (sighs) Is this your mom's place? Will she mind me being here? - She won't even know. - Why? (light switch snaps) (dog barks) - Here we go, like that T-shirt, fits well, doesn't it? Very nice, very, very nice. So, does he snore then? (laughs) Better have some more. Ah, this is why your door was locked last night then. Had your boyfriend round, didn't ya? I won't tell your mum, though, she won't approve. But she don't get it. I'm alright with it, though, sort of. I don't mind sharing ya. Neither did she, eh? Shit, it's too early to talk about all that. Here, come over here, another drink. Lovely looking boy, Jason. Lovely name too, looks good in boxers. - He's not my boyfriend. - He helped me out last night. Like I said, I'll be out of here later today. - At least you got some milk with my money, then? No food, though? - Well, I was gonna, but I got your mum a little gift from you. - I'll be off, then. Thanks your help last night. - You can stay longer if you need to. Get yourself sorted. - Are you kidding? I've got to pay Ivan back for all that gear. He will not let go. I've got work. Don't look at me like that. Don't you dare moralize. I'm at rock bottom. What about you? You know my story, I don't know yours. I know your mum's dying. She's been in prison, she's fucked you up like this. Fucking velvet rage, did I touch a nerve or something? Maybe I'll stick around to hear another installment from your Aunty Jane. Look, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry, it's your business. (sighs) I am grateful for last night. And I could do with another night away from... (coins clinking) Here, take this. Go get some food. Right, you're going out. Probably best if I didn't go. (traffic hums) (phone rings) (muffled background conversation) - So would you say that you were your mother's carer? - I've been through this with you already. - [Voiceover] Please leave, we will not be spoken to like that, get out! - Look, can I get some money? Or at least a job. - Well, it's just a bit more complicated than that. You brought your documents in, that's good. We've made some copies. Now I'm just gonna put you in the system. - I'm already in the fucking system. - Unfortunately, without a clear employment history or a record of tax contributions, there is no great deal that we can do for you at present. Your claim's been rejected. - Thanks a fucking bunch, enjoy your coffee. And your life. (phone rings) (rap music) (door slams) - [Cal] Where's Jane? - She's gone to hospital to see your mum. - For fuck's sake. - What? (sighs) (slow, sorrowful music) (sighs) (scrapes bowl) (knife scratching) (sugar shaking) (crunches, sighs) (light acoustic guitar) - Hey, you alright? - [Man in White] You alright? - Yeah, (all mumble) I'm Cal. What's you name, man? Keith, how you doing? (laughing) - ♫ You won't remember the name of the song (laughing) ♫ You hear it when you walk alone ♫ You can't remember quite what was wrong ♫ - You hiring? - Does this look like a job center? - Same smell. - Is what you want, boy? - Something to get me started. - It's a new economy out there. 500 notes will get you signed up. Even junkies are in recession. (somber acoustic guitar) (long, airy moan) - Mrs. Miller? I understand you've spoken to one of the team and you've asked not to be resuscitated. Just need to check that you understand what you're saying and I was also wondering have you spoken this over with your son? - [Cath] (breathes heavily) I don't want him to have to make this decision. - ♫ How you gonna carry on ♫ - Hey, got any jobs? - Grunt's work, clean the pans, washing floors. Six pound an hour with references. - I've worked in European kitchens as a sous chef. - Six pound an hour with references. Three pound without. No food prep, just clean up. You got a uniform? - Ya, I got whites. - But no references. - No, I can batonnet, dice, allumette, mince, julienne, brunoise. - But no references. - Not on me. (door slams) Look, I'll work for free for a week to prove it. (clock ticking) (footsteps) (sing-song mumbling) (doorknob squeaking) (low clicking) (fast, heavy footsteps) - [Cal] Shit! We're fucked. - And my clothes stink. (clock ticking) I've got an idea. But I don't think you're gonna like it. (birds tweeting) - We don't have any buckets. - Relax, she's got everything we need. I think this is it. (upbeat music) - Excellent timing. ♫ It's illusion baby illusion ♫ - [Cal] Oi, how much we got? (laughing) Come on then, show me, fucking hell. - Like I said, easy money. - Get in. - I know you won't like this, but he's got a lovely boyfriend. Good influence, I think. Do you know, nicely spoken, too. Student, I think. Got a few issues, if you know what I mean. I ain't heard no shagging he might be a Catholic or sumat. Still, lovely none the same. Shut them out, didn't I? You don't wanna hear about buggas and all. What am I saying? How you doing? Is it nice to have Cal back? Have you told him what's going on yet? How bad it is? He don't exactly know what's going on but he ain't stupid, Cath. It's last days, isn't it? (wheezing) I'm sorry, it's just, it's so hard. I want to tell him but I won't. You've got to do it, do you hear me? How's the art therapy going, then? Let's have a look. Oh, that's beautiful, Cath. It's really getting there. It's proper gorgeous, that is. Huh, wait 'til he sees it. (sighs) - Jane says your mom hates you being gay. - What else did she tell you? (birds tweeting) - Not a lot. - Do you want to go back to uni? - Do you wanna go back to France? - It's a bit hard without my bloody passport. Come on, let's go. (washer spins) (light piano music) - So, do you have a boyfriend? - Had. - What happened? (whistling) (laughing) (traffic passes) (heart monitor beeps) (ventilator whooshes) - How'd you get in here? Told 'em to tell you to fuck off. I don't wanna see you. (paper rustling) (panting) I don't want you here. Janey tells me you're still a shirt-lifter. A queer. Faggot. (breathing heavily) It's hard to reckon with you being mine. Fuck off, (panting) please. (wheezing) Get out of here! You come to kill me with your dirty homo kissing. Come to see your dying mum, bring no chocolates, no flowers, get out of here! - Shall I put the chair in front of the door? - Don't bother. - It's probably the drugs that's made your mum so harsh. - Whatever. - When she comes he won't hurt her. (light kisses) (breathing intensifies) (low-pitched, intense music) (music builds in intensity) (loud kissing) (moaning) (fast breaths) (mechanical, intense music) (seagulls crying) (spoon tinkles) - Oi, and what is wrong with tea? - I don't like it without milk. - Well, good job I bought some last night, then, sugar? - Fucking O, you got sugar too? - I think we all got some sugar last night. And if you didn't, well honestly, you should've. I thought you gays were at it like rabbits, almost as manly as Mick here. (laughs) We went a li'l gay ourselves last night, didn't we? Walked on the wild side. God, my ass is raw this morning. (chuckles) (insistent footsteps) (coins clinking) - 37 P (heart monitor beeping) - [Doctor] I'm sorry are you going in? - Thinking about it. - [Doctor] Who did you want to see? - Me mum, Cath Miller? - Ah, has anyone told you what to expect? - Nothing. - The prognosis isn't good, you've arrived just in time. Because I'm not sure that she's going to pull through. Of course, we're making her as comfortable as possible. And treating the pain with as much permitted medication as we can. And she's very strong but I don't think it's going to be very long now. - How long? - Very soon, your being here will help. She's been telling us all about your travels. You've just come back from France, is that ri... Good afternoon, ladies. (squeaking) (dove cooing) (slow, sorrowful music) - What are you looking at? - Nothing, be happy. (light keyboard music) - I don't care that his dick smells like rotting flesh. If he wants it sucked, you fucking suck it, Hm, just like a real professional. Jason, come. (fireworks blast, scream) (fireworks crackle) - Jason, where's Jason? Jason! - [Jane] What are you shouting and shouting-- - Jason! (car horn beeps) (fireworks crackle) (dog barking) (rattling door handle) Come on, let him out. - I have a little business for him and for you, too. If you're interested, it's worth 500 pounds each. And no sex involved. I can always find someone else if you like, to go with him but I thought maybe you like to help out. 500, plus your passport. - Half up front. (car engine starts) (fireworks screaming) (car hums) (stumbling) (paper rustling) (parking brake creaks) - What are you waiting for? Get out. - What's out there? - Opportunity and eh this and money. Maybe you can buy your sick mother some flowers. Oh and I know everything. Jason, he tells me everything. You know the story of the scorpion and the frog? No, it's alright, I tell you. So this frog, he carries scorpion across the river. And halfway across, the scorpion, he sting the frog. Frog ask, "Why?" The scorpion say, "Because it's in my nature." Jason's same. Like me, we don't change. We survive, because it's in our nature. Now get out, and help carry him across the river. (doors open) (car engine rattles) (footsteps echo) - Keep going. Keep going, little froggie. (beeping) (metallic bang) - Jesus, what the fuck? - Just a little more. Okay now, take off all your clothes. No arguments. Quick, now! (labored breathing) - [Voiceover] Yeah. - Okay now, my client would like you both to uh, to fight. (laughs) I'll never understand you queers. What, you'll suck a cock, but you won't throw a punch? (sighs) Okay, okay I'll make choice, okay. You fight or I kill you both, now, starting with your girlfriend. (smacking punch) - Fake it, it's the only way we're gonna live. Come on! Hit me! Hit me! - [Crowd] Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! (siren blares) - Come on! (wailing, moaning) (sirens intensify) (crowd cheering) (yelling) (clattering crash) (labored breathing) (punching) - You see what they fucking did? (dismal, heavy music) (struggling grunts) (crowds yelling, chanting) (crowd cheering) (mob yelling) (painful grunting) (shuddering softly) (heaving breaths) - Good, the client will be pleased. Now, uh, you finish him. - [Cal] Finish him? - Rape him. (breathy crying) - Rape him? - Yes, don't worry, you'll be paid a little extra. Now, help me get him closer. (labored breathing) (loud thud) - Get out! (frightened breathing) Jason, get the clothes and get in his car. (panting) (door shuts) (shuddering) - Oh God, oh God, no, please don't kill us. I didn't mean it. I'll give you money, anything you want. - Shut up and come here. (crying piteously) - What you gonna do now, smart boy? You won't get away with this. I know where you live. And I probably know your mother. Maybe she worked for me, huh? Another loser whore like you, maybe? Ow! She's gonna go to hell. And every bastard there will fuck her and fist her until she shits out another fucked-up faggot like you. (gun blasts) Ah! (crying) Fucking hunt you down! Motherfucker! (sobbing) Fucking hunt you down, you fuck! (car engine starts) (sobbing pathetically) (peaceful music) (phone vibrating) - Mm, hello. - [Voiceover] Good morning - Yeah? - [Voiceover] This is Mr. Rhodes, Cath Miller's consultant. I'm afraid she took a turn for the worse last night. Can you come straight into the hospital? - Okay, yeah thanks. - We gotta leave today (rustling papers) (exhaling loudly) Go to mine and grab everything, meet me at the station. I gotta do something before we leave. If I'm not there, wait for me. I'll be as quick as I can. - [Jason] Thank you. (dramatic music) (water splashes) (loud sigh) (door shuts) (light piano music) (crying softly) (wheezing) (heart monitor beeps) (ventilator whooshing) - [Nurse] Should I take these for you? - Cal? They better be my favorites. - 'Course, soft centers. - Do you dare? Real men don't cry. - Mum, I gotta go. I gotta leave. - I know, son, I know. You and me both (laughs softly). Take care of yourself, son. Ca-- - Sh! Don't. (crying) - (swallows hard) My pad. Take it, please. - Bye, Mum. Love you. (light piano music) (motor churning) - Cal! - We're leaving, just let us go. - I've come to say good-bye. (train brakes screech loudly) (steam hisses) (slow acoustic music) (breathy chuckle) (pained breathing) - ♫ We're all on the road ♫ The road well traveled on ♫ Sleep walkin' keep talkin' ♫ Down my lane walk legacy ♫ To the place to the place ♫ Where history keeps repeating itself (crying) ♫ The world wrapped up ♫ Good luck ♫ Home to stay ♫ Tell the truth (train whirs) ♫ We're all on the road ♫ The road well traveled on ♫ Sleep walkin' keep talkin' ♫ Down my lane walk legacy ♫ To the place to the place ♫ Where history keeps repeating itself ♫ Construct plans with battens in hand ♫ Follow take a bow ♫ To the fans ♫ We all act like ♫ We didn't seem to know ♫ One with hunger ♫ Drink our wine ♫ Consume consuming ♫ You sweat your laughter ♫ But the joke is always on you ♫ We're all on the road ♫ We're all on the road ♫ We're all on the road ♫ We're all on the road ♫ (powerful acoustic music)
