- Jean-Jacques. - Hello. Go away, I'm working. We'll find a solution, Jean-Jacques. Mr. Lucas, I send you letters, you don't reply. You don't answer our phone calls. Sorry, but I have to take your storage shed. You can come with whoever you like, you're not taking anything! Jean Jacques, let's try to do this calmly. I've got a small shed, you can stock anything there, it's yours. Damn! My place is here! Why should I go elsewhere? Give me a month or two! Come on. We've given you over a year. One year... Damn! The frost got all my apricots, I've lost everything... It's over, Mr. Lucas, it's over now. We'll try to get a precise inventory of your gear. - It'll be complicated, he's tired... - Yeah. Don't be dumb, Jean Jacques. NO! Are you ok? - I'm gonna get a coffee, want one? - No, thanks. Where's Dad? In intensive care. His shoulder muscles are torn, his collar bone is burnt. They even found lead in his aorta, but luckily not in any vital organs. Will he pull through? Yeah, this time... What happened? A policeman grabbed the gun at the last minute. What about his debts? He's not mentioned them for ages. I saw the bailiff. He'll suspend the seizure until we have a plan. What do you think? We must convince him to sell the rest. You'll say that? After what he's done? There are procedures for people at risk. He'll never speak to us again. When did you last see him, Christmas? Don't start. It's not just you, he won't see me either. He kills himself working, alone. You know very well why. The land's already lost. He'll have to sell sometime. But it belongs to him, damn it! He didn't steal it. He slaved away his whole life. You think it's fair? We have to help him. I don't have the means and I doubt you do either. Follow us. - Mr. Tardieu. - Philippe. - How is your dad? - It'll take him a while to recover. Can I have the key to the storage shed? What will you do? I'd like to take care of his stock. I want to help him. Isn't it a bit late for that? Can I have the key or not? I wonder why he's so fond of this depot. I found him another, but... It belonged to grand-dad. It's all that's left of their heydays. Know what he was going to sell? No, I haven't been to the land yet. If you come back, let me know for the site. Okay. Can you get the mail, please? Yeah. Only bills. Are they ripe enough? Yeah. But it won't be enough. You can use the money from the next weed harvest. We can manage, the building is going well. That won't be enough either. I think Cyril is right. It won't change things. Is that what you think? You'll work like a dog at the warehouse and the market... whatever you make, your dad'll say it's not enough, or you've sold it too cheap. José! Go on, Pierre. You're Philippe? I saw you run at the Arles bullring. You understand the animals. What exactly did Bruno tell you? That you need a place to stash your stock. and I shouldn't meet you. Did he say what happened to the last minder? I killed him. You're a farmer's son. Why do this? My dad tried to kill himself. He's lost too much land. Enough is enough. That's what you'll say when you lose sleep over my pot? What'll I say? That it's to save your dad? It's a one-off. Until you find a solution for the other deliveries. You need this, me too. José, we're ready. I'm coming. You send me your big buyers. Get them to come here and in 2 minutes it's sorted. What's the daytime like here? It's dead, there's no-one. They can't come during the day, just the morning, 5-8. That's short. We don't have a choice, the buyers go away, the oldies go back to their fields. Before that it's full, that's the best time for us to work. Got a safe place to stash the stock? Yeah. It's the old cooling system, we kept it when it was replaced. We can just keep the box. Honestly, who's gonna come here? This region was made here. For the cops, it's a museum. Their grand-dads run it. They'll never investigate. If we sell quick, it could work. But I handle it all myself or they'll get suspicious. And as I'm doing more than stashing, I take 30%. I've got a van waiting in Marbella. When can you start? As soon as your driver arrives. Is that him? Yes, it's him. - What's up? - They’re here! You're gone to be alright? I'm here. Yes? Can I help you, sir? I'm his son. Good timing, come help me. Come on, Mr. Lucas. Are you alright? Do you want to go outside? No, I don't feel like it. Want me to leave you? No, stay. Sit down there. You really need this thing? No, they're worried I'll fall, they think I'm too weak. It's bullshit, she pisses me off. How do you feel? Alright. I just want to get out. - What do the doctors think? - Bullshit, I told you. They want to put me in a rest home. You'll need it. Really? And the sales? The produce will sell itself? And I've got melons coming. I went back to the market. What do you mean? To take care of your stock before it perishes. What about your job at the warehouse? I'm doing both. I thought it would help you. 100 euros won't change much. You can't manage alone. What will you do when the bailiff comes to the farm? Get the gun out again? At least I'll croak on my land. What about that walk? I didn't feel like it. - I'll get you a wheelchair. - No, don't bother, thanks. Mr. Lucas, make an effort. You're a pain! He said he didn't want to! I'm off. Don't worry, they won't take anything from us. ...for the last time, these pear trees that he planted 20 years ago. After another catastrophic season he decided to uproot his orchard. 3 bulldozers have just done the dirty work. It took the trees 10 years to yield quality fruit but it'll take less than 10 days to uproot them, all 13 hectares. Cost of the uprooting: 20,000 euros, more than he's earned this year. - Was there no other solution? - No, no, trees need taking care of, we can't leave them untreated. Treating them is expensive, so when I have no more money to do that, it's not worth carrying on, I won't get into debt. You have to stop sometime. He had to sell his pears for a lot less than cost price. José will tell you what to give each client. We only sell blocks. When they're here, you let us know. Never give anyone anything unless José said so. Remember about the codes? I remember. The prices are already settled. No-one should argue. Anyway, they pay before, you never handle the money. Bruno's covering you at the entrance, I'll never be far away. There are 2 sales this morning. Didn't José say to come in a van? - Can you see us driving a van? - You better find one. It's all there. What do I do with your zucchini? Stick 'em up your ass. It's underneath. Ok, Ok. Yeah, it's me. All's good but tell your guys we're not in Miami. Yeah. You look knackered. You can't keep this up for long. So? - I don't know about you but it's hell for us. No hiring, only students. Since February, Cyril has had to wash the dishes. I've got less costs than you. And pizzas always sell. You do nouvelle cuisine, maybe it scares people. No, that's not it, everyone's counting their pennies. Hi. How are you? - You OK? - What do you want to eat? We've got time, we're having a drink. Excuse me... Will you go? Thanks. Tardieu called. Why the hell did you go to the market? I told you I wanted to help him. That's not helping him at all. You're giving him false hope. How do you know? You didn't even come to see the crop. He owes over 30,000 this time with more debts pending! Selling his zucchini is the solution? He needs support not just money. Damn! He nearly killed himself, he's depressed. We must take legal responsibility. Doctors' words, not mine. To save him, we must sell what's left. To save him or you? What are you saying? Your business doesn't seem to be going too well. Maybe you need the money. Fuck! What's going on? Why the fuck did you say that? He acts like it's not his business. He's right, see it from his position. You really think you can pay all his debts? I've got a business partner, I sell his pot in the shed. I do the sales and I get a cut. I don't believe it. Who is this guy? José. - Bruno works for him. - My cousin? Did Bruno get you into this? I asked him. But I told you we could sell the weed. We need a lot more. What will your dad say to your 30,000 warehouseman's wage? I'll say I saved up and got a loan. It's only for 1 or 2 weeks, a one-off. Your dad doesn't need your money, he needs you to be there, all of you, to forgive him, or he won't forgive himself! Perhaps. But it's too late. It's too late. It'll be better in prison? Will he visit you there? Hopefully, because I won't! I'm done with this family of mutes. I have to go to the farm. You coming? No. It'll just take 1 hour. No, don't worry, I'll get the bus. Dad, what're you doing here? It's my place, isn't it? you okay? I'm alright. - Hello. - Hello. Jean-Jacques Lucas. This is the grocer from... Istres. He already took 4 crates. When did you get them? Yesterday. Here. It's all there. Go on! - You okay? What the fuck's he doing here? He got a release to harvest the melons. - The doctor let him? - You seen the time? Doctor's asleep, the guard called me. And you let him leave? We can't tie him up! Leave me alone, I know what I'm doing. Can I take some for the restaurant? Yes, want a crate? Don't worry, I'll get it. You must keep your books up to date. You think I've got the time? Where did you find the guy from Istres? We needed new clients so I went round the restaurants and suppliers. That's no excuse for letting the books go. Dad, let's go? See you soon. Yeah, it's me. My dad came to the market, you have to cancel everything! A beautiful crop this year. In the hospital it was like eating sponges. The Tésive plot must be nearly ready, we must harvest it now. I won't have time. I didn't ask you. I'll do it myself, it's fine. You can't even stand up. I'll go to the market and ask if anyone can help me. You know you can't go there. You must rest. What should I do then? Lose it all? I don't like giving advances. Don't make me cancel another sale. Okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What are you doing? How did you pay them? With the money in my pocket. Why? I told them I'd pay on sale! I didn't know. Well I did! I'll help you load at the depot. You don't need to Dad, you've already done too much today. Don't worry. Go home and rest, I'll manage. As you wish. That's for the melons. You sold them all? Yeah. They all sold this morning? Blanc came to see me for a flash sale at Aldi's. I gave him a discount. I don't have much time. Didn't Blanc go organic? Yeah... He doesn't really check... - You told him it was organic? - He was in a hurry, his van was leaving... It's all the same anyway. - Not at all. - It doesn't matter... Dad, if they check you'll get the blame! You make me mad! You know how it works if you wanna sell them. OK, so you'll pay the fine. Don't start. It doesn't matter, the sale's done. If there's a check we'll deal with it. I'm going to the warehouse, I'm late. You know it doesn't matter. See how he speaks to me? He's working a lot, you know. So do I, doesn't stop me being polite. Yeah, well at least he helps me. How long since you came here? Dad, you know I'm always at the restaurant! I know, but we needed you here. You never stop! You OK? Yeah, and you? Your arm? - I'm fine. - Yeah? What're you doing here? I brought you some food. That's kind, you didn't have to. It's hot... Let's go inside and cool down. Let's! Your house coming on? Yeah, you should come by. While you can... Sorry, I shouldn't have, but... My dad was like you, drove me mad. Where did your dad work? At Figo. Oh shit, the thief! They all are, racist too. It's Mississippi here, you should grow cotton. Did Philippe ask you to come? He doesn't decide what I do. And I barely see him; he's killing himself for you. Yeah, I know... He must think I resent him. I should've been there when he messed up. That's your opinion. It's what you think, isn't it? I think you blame yourself the most but it's not your fault. Not Philippe, or your wife... and even less the shit you're in. I don't want to bother you with that. You're not. You were right to come. If you carry on we'll all pay because Philippe won't stop... I've already had my share, I don't want to lose him too. Don't worry. - No, the water's cold darling, ask aunty. -Thanks! - Come on aunty, it's not cold. - No, darling, aunty can't swim. Enzo, stop it. We don't want to. I can't take anymore of this shit. It's all I think about. Yeah, me too. I told you not to do it. Do you have to say that now? Got much more to sell? Not much. It'll be over by next week. He won't let you stop. - Yes? I've come for the order. Manu, 3 blocks. Dunno what you mean. José told me to come. I don't know a José. And I'm shut. You don't wanna do that. Where's your stash? Nothing, eh? There's nothing here. Nothing? Nothing! Don't worry, Kader'll make him talk. There's a guy following us. He's shooting! Be carful! Be careful! Stay there. Here, take this. It'll be OK. You must eat something. There's not much more to sell. I'll get it so we can finish. Just come by next week and I'll give you your share. They're coming. Is it him? You ratted on me to Kader? Get up! Get up! Come on! Open! I don't have to see this, shit! We live with it... And you will too. You're no better than us. Fear is true strength, if they're not scared of you, you've no chance. Know what they do in Mexican cartels? That's true horror. We're not in Mexico. It's the same world and you're in it. You can lie to your dad but not to yourself. What do we do with Bruno? Bruno's dead. Dead with the dead, living with the living. What happened to you? Nothing, I had a fight. - What's this about? - It's nothing, leave it! I know we haven't met up for ages, but why today? You dumb or what? It's the anniversary of Mom's death. I'm sorry, I don't even know what day it is anymore. You work too much. But we've never done this before. I know, but... I needed us to be together today. I'm gonna wash up. Hurry up, it's all ready. Prehistoric men are wild. - Prehistoric now... - No... No, with the bone... - Do I look like a Prehistoric man? - Yes. - Leave it, I'll do it. - No, I'm not tired. I believe you, but I want to do it. If it'll make you happy. - There. I'll take a nap. - OK. - I'll leave you. You staying for a bit? -Yes. I'd like to visit my colleagues one day. - OK. - Will you come with me? OK. - See you later. - See you. Damn, he never calls back, I'm sick of it. - Who? - Bruno. Bruno, you loser! Call me back about your wife's top, or I'll keep it. Every year it's the same story. He's unbelievable: I cough up and he doesn't call me back. - You ok? -Yeah. - Hi. You'r better? How are you? - What's up? - She's with the cops. - The cops? - She's declared Bruno missing. They'll want to talk to you. Come in. It's not like him to do that. I'm really worried, there's no sign of Bruno, I dunno what's up... - It's Philippe, the friend I mentioned. -Hello. Lieutenant Hautain. Had any contact with him recently? Not recently. When was the last time you saw him? I couldn't say. About 2-3 weeks, I'm working a lot at the moment. Hang on, didn't they come to see you recently? Last week, when we went to the lake. - With Sonia. Oh yes, a week ago. - One week ago? - Yes. Why did you lie to them? I couldn't remember the date. Was he in on the market deal? I can't tell you about that. - You fucking with me? - Calm down or go outside. - What happened? - I'm telling you I can't explain. - What happened? - Stop it, damn! Calm down. Not here, not here. Where is he? We couldn't leave his body, it would've got us into trouble. They would have got me. He would have done it for me, too. It was a one-off. It's over. Go tell Emily. She can't go on like that. I included the deals you fucked up. Thank you. So, your dad, his debts, they not even paid yet? I've sorted one part. I did what I could. We all think it's the best deal we've ever had. What about coke? We agreed it was only a one-off. Listen. If we move on to charlie we max profit. At least 10 times more. Dad's back at the market, I can't. I'm not talking about your dad. I'm talking about you. What do you decide? Have you never wanted to start over? You seen how far we go? Where can you go after that? It all stays in your head. You watch the TV. You watch your kids grow up. And you see your pal burn. Time is nothing. I'm not one of you. I'm stopping it all. We behave like animals. We spend our lives at war. You think you can turn up, take your cash and leave? Fucking bastard, dream on! Come here! Come here! Chuck me in there, send the bull, I don't care. Why would I do that? You're so damn thick. It's your dad I'll stick in there. I've no use for him. It'll take a while to weigh it all. No orders this morning. We'll start tomorrow. Ok. - Wait, I've gotta ask you something. - What is it? My brother's lost his restaurant. I'm gonna have to help him. Your brother? That's a shame. And your cat? Lost your cat too? Why tell me your life story? I don't give a damn about your family. What I mean is that I need a lot more. And I've got another idea for you. We buy greenhouses and sell our own weed. I already do it on a small plot, but there's still the land for sale. There's huge potential. Compared to what we have here? But charlie is risky... If the cops get your van or suppliers you lose a lot. Is this guy for real? Damn drugs lord. Ok. We'll go see it together. Did you talk to Emilie? I can't face it. I think about her all the time, about Enzo, I won't be able to. The first time Bruno went down, it was for a hold-up on a bar. I didn't know how to stop him messing up. I'd tell him... that he'd croak for a packet of fags. - That would have been as bad. - No, this time you were there. Now, when I see you, I think of him. I can't send you back to prison, but I can't sleep next to you anymore. Doesn't it take a lot of water? There's a supply, we won't be lacking. How many greenhouses can we set up next door? No more than 2 if we wanna be discreet. Especially if they're in my name. How long for one harvest? That depends on the seeds, and as a farmer's son, I do what I want with my land! I don't know what you are but you bring in cash. I've got this too. How much do you want for that? I want him and the others out of my life. You're paying for a war? I want be left in peace. I don't want see you again, either. I wanted to talk to you about the frost and the apricots. Why don't we install a heating system? Sends hot air to the crops. - You know how much that costs? - At least 5,000, but at least when the frost hits you can manage. I don't have the cash. I do though. I've enough to keep the shed too. You want to take over, that’s it? It's our land, isn't it? You always said we'd have to fight to keep it. Well... It's over, Philippe. I've sold everything. What did you sell? The land, all of it. Except the farmhouse. Everything surrounding it. The neighbor bought it, I think he wants to have greenhouses. One more harvest and it's over. When did you do that? 2 weeks ago. Sonia and I discussed it. Your mum said I'd lose you all if I carried on. She was right. But I'm grateful for what you did.
