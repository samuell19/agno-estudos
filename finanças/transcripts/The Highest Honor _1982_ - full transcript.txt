[bomb explosion] [soldiers shrieking] [gunshots firing] [gunshots firing] [bomb explosion] [soldiers shrieking] [bomb explosion] [engine revving] [airplane engine revving] [cup bumping] - Morning, sir. - Well, chaps, we're implementing Operation Exit. - When do you want that? - Wouldn't wanna get much worse. Now, we're establishing an escape route. There are a lot of people who must be siphoned out of Singapore. Communications experts, technicians, senior civil servants. - Go through Sumatra Sir. - Yes. Now, Captain Lyon, you'll be based here at Pulau Durian. You'll move them on the Indragiri River, here. You, Captain Davis will be located there, and move them on to Ringgit, for evacuation to Salam. - Right, Sir. - I'll be at Ringgit. - And when do we leave, sir? - Well, now. - Now, sir? - Yes, I'm afraid so. There's a boat waiting for you at Kaliaki. - Very good, sir. [dramatic music] [boat engine revving] [dramatic music] - Which one of your blokes is Gordon Highlanders? - [Gordon] Yes. [boat engine revving] - You're Captain Lyon? - Yes. - Reynolds. You are the one I dropped at Pulau Durian? - That's correct, yeah. [boat engine revving] Where'd you pick up this old scout? - Navy commander. He was a Jap fishing boat. Bottom full of worm, engine run by a treadmill of white mice. - But beautifully nondescript. - But then he sort of like mates, he'll get you where you are going. - And maybe back again. - Why would you bother? You've had the dick in Singapore. That will see the weak out. [birds chirping] [car engine revving] - Well, there she is Digger, the house on the hill. - Excuse me. - Right over, fellas. This way. [dramatic music] [horn blowing] [suspense music] [boat engine revving] [dramatic music] - The Krait? - Krait, it's an Indian name for a snake. Now, what do you think of her? - She's a tub, a 100% first class bloody tub. - That's exactly what we need. - Captain Lyon. - Major, did you have a good trip, Bill? - It depends on your point of view. We were turned on a bloody rogue pathway, we would never have got here if it wasn't for my engineer. [door thudding] Come up here and meet the new owners. [waves crashing] - If you are the new owners, sir, you have my sympathy. - I'll leave you with a Lieutenant Carse, Bill, handover command or whatever it is you Navy types do. - Aye, aye, sir. - When are you gonna tell me where you want me to take this thing? - Well, she used to work out of Singapore tub. That's why she's so valuable to us. [dramatic music] - As an absolute training, maximum 15 hours. [door thuds] - Come in. - How are you? - Well, thanks. - I'm Major Ivan Lyon, this is Don Davis and my two IC, who are Navy. - Bobby Page. - Welcome on board, do sit down. - Thank you, sir. - Why did you volunteer for Z, Bob? - I thought it was about time I did something positive. That's partly the reason. - And your father is Deputy Administrator of New Guinea, is that correct? - That's the other part. He's a prisoner of the Japs. - So is Major Lyon's wife. - I also see you as a soldier, highly decorated. - Five times, sir. - Don't try to outdo him, will you? - Hardly. - I'm not looking for any heroes around here. - I'm not the type, sir. - Good. Right, let's put you in the picture. [dramatic music] [boat engine revving] Everyone forward. [dramatic music] Hi. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you where we're going to till now, but there were the usual security reasons that I'm sure you'll all appreciate. The fact is we're on our way to Singapore. - You beauty. What I tell you? [soldiers chattering] - Now, we're going in as close as we can with the Krait. Establish a base on one of the islands at the top of the Riau Archipelago, send the canoe teams in from there, and attach limpet mines to enemy ships in Singapore Harbor. [soldiers laughing] - Bloody Jap ship mate. - Now, we have a Japanese boat, and we are flying the Japanese flag. That's our best chance of escaping detection in the weeks ahead. So it is not strictly by the book, but there we are. I make this point, because I want you all to be aware that if we are captured, there is every possibility that we'll be executed as spies. And we also start looking like what we're supposed to be. - Japanese. - Malays. - Bob, top side. [soldiers laughing] - You'll do me, Bob. You don't look Malay to me, he looks more like a Bangkok hoe. [soldiers chattering] [dramatic music] [boat engine revving] - This is our 40th day since we left Australia. I don't like running in this close. - Not to worry, Ted, I've been into these parts before. - On foot no doubt. - I had a year in Singapore before the war. I spent my honeymoon down here. - Honeymoon? - Right where we are now, in fact. She drove out the same. I got through then we'll get through now. - Bit better company than this trip. - Certainly better looking. [boat engine revving] - [Captain Lyon] It's on, Page. - [Page] Done. - I'll be reaching Penang Island in two hours time, and we make it our base. We drop the canoes in as soon as it gets dark. - So give us something to tell the kids, eh, Bob? - Well, I just hope we can pull it off. Keep your fingers crossed the Japs aren't too lively around that harbor. - Yeah. I wonder what the little buggers are up to right now. [singing foreign music] [dramatic music] - Looks like they never heard about blackout. - Yes. - Well, best of British flood lights. - They take catch ups. [ship hooting] [metal clanks] [waves crashing] [bell ringing] [waves crashing] [singing foreign music] [man coughs] [bombs explode] [people shrieking] [bomb explodes] [bell ringing] [alarm rings] - [speaks in foreign language] [bombs explode] [soldiers cheering] [soldiers chattering] - [Soldier One] Congratulations, lad. You pulled it off. [soldiers chattering] [suspenseful music] - [News Reporter] In the early hours of the morning, a series of explosions in Singapore resulted in the sinking of seven Japanese military cargo vessels. The attackers caused great loss of faith for the Shonan authorities, who have shown themselves vulnerable to this type of sabotage. This is "The spirit of resistance of Malay," signing off for today. - What do you think of it, Don? - It's a bit more sea worthy than the Krait. - It won't be quite the same though, will it? No more sarongs or blacking up? - Oh, there will be later. - Ivan, I'm no pessimist, but I would prefer that it wasn't Singapore again. I think we're pushing our luck. - Not necessarily. According to our intelligence, the Japanese think the last raid was conceived by our men in Changi Prison and carried out by local guerillas. - Well, they have no idea it was us? - Not the slightest. [laughs softly] That's why I wanna make it Singapore again. That's where we can hit them the hardest. - Well, you know me, Ivan, where you go, I go. [soldiers chattering] - Quiet! Quiet! Come on, keep it down! - I'm sorry, sir. - Right. I'd like to extend a welcome to the new members for the next operation, code named Rimau. And a special thanks to the old hands from the Krait, who've come in for another go. [soldiers cheer] Now, you all know each other, but I don't think you've met this gentleman. This is Major Otto Ingleton from the Royal Marines. Now, he's acting as an observer for Southeast Asia Command. And he'd be coming with us to see how it's all done. - Well, I'll try to keep out of your way. And I don't mind being called a Pommy, so long as it's not that Pommy bastard. - Okay. [soldiers chattering] - For the success of Operation Rimau, down the hatch. - [Soldiers] Cheers. [soldiers chattering] - Pleased you could make it Bob. - Well, I couldn't let you fellows go wandering off on your own. You'd get lost, Bob. - Thanks for coming, Bob. - Well, there's a job to be done, Ivan. - There's some great new toys to do it with too. One man subs, that were designed at Special Operations in England. They have a range of 35 miles, can cruise down to a depth of about five fathoms. And can get along about four knots. They are battery powered, and their operator wears oxygen gear. We call them Sbs, submersible boats. The Japs won't know what's hit them. [man whistles] Departed Freemantle 1225 hours, West Australian Standard Time, 11th of September. Proceeding north through Lombok Strait to Singapore area, with group known as Rimau, Malay for tiger, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lyon, and comprising 22 officers and other ranks, of Z Special Force. We'll unload five tons of store on Merapas Island. And establish rear base for party, before proceeding onto Singapore waters. [dramatic music] [man speaks in foreign language] [dramatic music] - What about this Colonel? - It's a 50 or 60 toner. Come and look at this, Don. - [Don] Yes, I like it. And she's obviously not carrying any cargo. - It's better. - Yeah. - Let's get in a little closer. Talisman, 20 degrees to four. - What 20 are we on, sir? [people chattering] [people chattering and laughing] [man shrieking] [men shrieking] [men speaking in foreign language] [water swooshing] - [Colonel Lyon] Right, gather around chaps. Now, as we're less than 12 miles off Singapore, let's just recap. Now, tonight we'll unload the SBs and the drivers and we'll go in for the attack. You, Raymond will stand by here on the junk. And we'll rendezvous back here at 05:00. Then we collect the canoes and stores and sink the junk in deep water. - And the SBs? - That's right. Then we make our way back to Merapas Island to meet up with the submarine. Now, I've allowed five miles a night. And it's 70 miles to Merapas. Now, we'll be there in 14 days. That's plenty of time to make the submarine pickup on the 8th of November. Have you got any questions? - Stand to, Japs. - Right, quick as you can. Two handguns please, quickly. Two handguns, please. Absolutely no shooting unless I give the order. [boat engine roaring] [man speaks in foreign language] - [Colonel Lyon] They are onto us. [gunshots firing] [dramatic music] You were told no shooting. Who was the stupid idiot that started all that? They are civilian police officers. Unarmed. [dramatic music] Oh, God. Right. Don, get the canoes out as fast as you can. - Not the SBs? - No, we're pulling out. [soldiers grumble] - We can still go in tonight. Singapore is only 12 miles away. - We have blown it. In a matter of hours the Japs will be swarming all over this area. - We have to hang around here for four weeks anyway, before the sub picks us up. We might at least give it a go. - We can't turn back within sight of the target. Ivan, we can be in and gone before they even wake to what's happening. And it will give them something else to think about in the morning. - No. It is my decision. - [Soldier] What? - It is my decision. We're getting out. Now, the most important thing, as far as I'm concerned, is the Japs do not get their hands on the SBs. There'll be another day. Now, move! - All right, let's jump to it. So close. [dramatic music] [waves crashing] [dramatic music] [bomb explodes] [dramatic music] [waves crashing] [airplane engine roaring] [men speaking in foreign language] [drum music] - Turn around. [waves crashing] [airplane engine roaring] [man speaking indistinctly] - [Captain Lyon] Be quick. Come on people. [gunshots firing] [birds chirping] [gunshots firing] [men shrieking] [gunshots firing] - Clear us a path I'll hold them up here. - Okay, boss. [gunshots firing] - I'll stay with you, Ivan. - Captain Page you will go with the men and that's an order! Now move, move! Come on, move! - We'll wait for you at Merapas. - You'll be all right, Dougie. [gunshots firing] [gunshots firing] - [Soldier] Were gonna have to go ghost here. [gunshots firing] [dramatic music] [gunshots firing] [dramatic music] [gunshots firing] [birds chirping] - Right, gentlemen. Our date with the submarine is four days away and we've still got five men unaccounted for. We know Don boarded. And we have to presume that Colonel Lyon is dead too. Any suggestions? - You think we should send a scouting party back for him? - Where would we start? - Japs! [gunshots firing] - Go now! [men shrieking] [gunshots firing] [birds chirping] - It's about four miles to the next island. Keep together. If anyone gets into trouble, we all wait. - You hear what the man said, eh? - We shouldn't strike any trouble. - He's taken us for a fight, all right. We used to make rafts out of when we were kids. - We'll hide out in this next island, until the eighth. Then one of us can swim back here, and try to make contact with the submarine. - What if they catch up with us again? - We'll keep moving on. - Plenty of cover around here. - Plenty of the Japs too. - What's the plan if we miss the sub? - Start heading south. [dramatic music] [birds chirping] - You can't say I didn't warn you, it'll be a long swim. - How long do you think it'll take to get back to Australia? - How long have we been on the run now? - About nine weeks. - Well, we can manage to pinch a boat somewhere. - Here, give me a hand. [man speaks indistinctly] - Yeah, it's only about 2000 miles. - Off, we need to be going now. - Well, we're on our own, mate, the sooner we get started. - Let's go. [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [car engine revving] [man coughs] [car hoots] - It is unfortunate for you men, that you have been taken prisoner. Your status will be decided, after you have been fully interrogated. And now, you must be made a little more presentable. [man speaks in foreign language] - You will go with Sergeant. [man speaks in foreign language] [dramatic music] [men speaking in foreign language] - I suppose, eucalyptus leaves remind you of home, eh? - Please, sit down. - You are Australian, aren't you? - Yes, I am Australian. Page Robert Charles, Captain, Australian Imperial Force. Regimental number NX 19158. - Have some coffee, captain. - Thanks. Am I being given special treatment because I'm an officer? - No, coffee's being given to everyone. - Even in the lowest ranks? - Of course. [speaks in foreign language] - Look, I'll be honest with you. I'm no captain. I'm an able sea man in the Australian Navy. [man speaks in foreign language] My name is Force Walter Gordon, but my mates call me Papa. - Papa? Why Papa? - 'Cause I'm a bit, long in the tooth. But my age, I'm old. - How old? - 24, I'm over the hill. - Where you from? - The casino in New South Wales. [man speaks in foreign language] - And what is the nature of your group? Your prisoners. - We're a mobile laundry unit. We came up for you to do your washing. [man speaks in foreign language] [table thuds] [man speaks in foreign language] Cheers. [men speaks in foreign language] [birds chirping] [ship hooting] [man speaks in foreign language] [man speaks in foreign language] - SB? - You were on a special mission called Operation Rimau. - What happened to the body? [men speaks in foreign language] - Buried him, where he was killed, on Karas Island. - He was our commanding officer. [man speaks in foreign language] - Nothing is written on the grave marker. I wish I had to put some kind of inscription on it. - Put, Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon, MBE, the Gordon Highlanders, RIP. [men speaks in foreign language] [ship hooting] How is Major Ingleton today? - The better for your inquiry in Mr. Tamiya. - This thing is for you. - Thank you very much. - You were asking about books. These are the only ones I can find in English. - Thank you. Ah, this is better, Shakespeare. - Oh, you did Shakespeare? - You find that strange? - No, I suppose not. Many Japanese officers, read and even write poetry. - You're joking. - No, I'm very serious. It is considered the most appropriate thing to do. - Sometimes Mr. Tamiya, you sound like an Oxford graduate. - No Major Ingleton, you've hurt my feelings. I'm a Cambridge man. - Really? - Why should I lie to you? Oh. I thought this might interest you. - Thank you, Tennyson. - Yeah. She's my favorite English poet. - I'm glad it has wide margins. - Yeah, you can start keeping a diary. - Well. - Thank you. - Oh, do any of you play chess? - Yeah, you're right. - Oh, I have a set. I will bring it tomorrow. - You play Mr. Tamiya? - Not very well. - Good, I'll take you on. - No, I cannot. - Thanks again. - Charming fellow. [man coughs] [door opens] - Mongrels. - It's [indistinct]. - It's Lieutenant Sargent. - Major Ingleton. - Papa, where are we? - Singapore. - My God, how far did you get? Made it to [indistinct]. - That's half my own. - Better than any of us. - Who else is with you? - [Sargent] Raymond and Riggs. - [Soldier] Where are they? - Further than [indistinct]. - It's all right, Dag, we will give ut another go, you know, they tracking you. You can never go. - [Sargent] Yeah, I'll be in it. Just gimme, a couple of minutes. Just a couple of minutes. [dramatic music] [sergeants speaking in foreign language] - How close were you to Singapore when you blew up the junk? - Oh, 12 miles or so, just across the straits. - It was fortunate for us that you destroyed those SBs. - Why do you say that? - You'd have created havoc if you'd got them into Singapore. - How much do you know about the SBs? - Oh, everything. Major Ingleton told us all about them. - Ingleton? - Yes, we discuss a lot of things. - Did I tell you, I used to live near his home in Essex. Oh, it's your move. - Mr. Tamiya, do you really know everything about the SBs? - Yes, Captain Page. We do. - Well, I suppose they're nothing new to you. You've had midget submarines for years. - Yes, that's true. [door squeaks] [door locks] - Otto, why did you tell our friends about the SBs? - What are you talking about? - There's no point in denying it. Tamiya told me about the little chat. - Are you accusing me of giving information to the enemy? - Did you or didn't you? - No, I did not. - You disappoint me Bob. - You didn't tell him anything? - Of course not. - Did you tell them about the SBs, Bob? [dramatic music] - Yes, I did. - It's a pity. - He lied to me, Otto. I thought... He softened me up by pretending to be my friend, and then he lied. When I get my hands on that bastard. [soldiers chattering] - There, take it easy, Bob. [ship hooting] - I trusted you Tamiya. [soldiers cheering] [soldiers chattering] - Now, hold it. - Get out of the way! - Take it easy, Bob. [soldiers shrieking] - [Captain Page] Just stay out of this. [gunshot fires] - Go on, shoot! Shoot! [gunshot fires] [sergeant speaks in foreign language] - Nobody asked you to help. [sergeants speaks in foreign language] [gate squeaks] - How's your arm, Bob? - Fine, fine. - What's it like in the outside world? - Busy, listen fellows. The Japs had decided to put the boot in because they weren't getting the information they wanted. But, Tamiya tricked me and got enough on the SBs to stop them from torturing us. We owe him then. - Where do you hear all this? - [indistinct] Just told me. - So it appears we misjudged Tamiya. [man speaks in foreign language] - Today, the last day, Water Kempatai, tomorrow you go. - What all this mean, old friend? - You Rimau, you, prisoner of war, war criminal. - Shit. - Tomorrow, you go, Outram Road Jail. [dramatic music] [sergeant speaks in foreign language] - Right, what a dump. [sergeant speaks in foreign language] [door thuds] [door thuds] - Mr. Tamiya. - [speaks in foreign language] - He's Major Tachibana of the legal department. He's here to investigate the legal implications of your Rimau activities. - [speaks in foreign language] - State your name and rank. - Don't be silly, you know my name and rank as well as I do. - State your name and rank. - Now, I'm not going to apologize, but I know why you tried to trick me. The men asked me to thank you. I'm sorry for knocking you around. - All right. But we really must get on with it. [men speaking in foreign language] - My name is Page Robert Charles, Captain, Australian Imperial Force. Regimental number N-- [airplane engine roaring] [alarm rings] [missiles falling] - Are those ours? - It's the Yanks. Give it to them. [soldiers cheering] - [News Reporter] In Singapore this morning by low flying American bombers, resulted in a number of direct hits on cargo ships anchored in the straits. And extensive damage to docking installations in Keppel Harbor. But the big news of the day comes from-- [chains rattle] [man speaks in foreign language] [door thuds] [footsteps creaking] [man speaks in foreign language] - How are you? - I'm well and you? How's your arm? - Not too bad, thanks to you. I'd come to think of us as friends, Mr. Tamiya. That's why I did the block when I thought you'd tricked me. - In our circumstances, it is very difficult to be friends, but we must try. Our war news is not good. It is a fight for time. - What do you mean? - Prolong investigation as long as you can. Did you know the war in Europe has ended? - Germany surrendered? - Unconditionally. - Marvelous. Bloody marvelous. When all this is over, you'll have to come and visit us in Australia. We'll tell them how you tried to help us here in prison. - It will be impossible. We've been told to fight on until the death. - But you're a civilian, that can't apply to you? - I am Japanese. - Yes, but, I don't see the point now. The war will end, all wars do. - Do you mind if I call you Bob? - Of course not. - Then you must call me Minoru. - Minoru. But I thought your blokes only used first names with very close friends. - Yes. That is our way. [birds chirping] [men speaking in foreign language] [door thuds] [men speaking in foreign language] - Yes. - Please. [man speaks in foreign language] [door thuds] - Let's get some air in here. - Yes, good. [men shouting] Why are they doing that to them? - They are protesting their innocence. - What did they do? - Blew up some ships in Singapore Harbor. [dramatic music] - When? - September before last. Bob, sit down. This is very important. So please pay attention. You are going to trial, but you have nothing to fear. General Itagaki will be generous. All it requires is a petition from you and the other prisoners. Do you understand? - Hmm. - Please, write it now. You must point out that, you were carrying out orders from your superiors in Australia. That, as soldiers, you had to obey. - We made the attack on Singapore. - What? - September 26th, 1943, we blew up seven ships. - That's impossible, there were no Sbs then. You said so yourself. - Yes, that's true. - Then how could you do it? - By canoe. - What? - You cannot kill innocent people. - Bob, you mustn't tell anybody about this. You would be putting a noose around your neck. Keep your mouth shut. - Okay. - Write the petition now. You were under oath. - Keeping my mouth shut would be the same as killing them with my bare hands. - Bob, if you don't write that you were carrying out orders, you will be tried as war criminals. - Minoru, I'm grateful for your concern. But I can't let those men die for something we did. - Please, write the petition. - We made the attack on Singapore. They are innocent. Let them go. - Bob. - Minoru, will you do this? [dramatic music] - Bob, I promise you, I will do something about the Chinese. But, please, you do something to help yourself. Bob! - We knew the risks. [gavel pounds] [man speaks in foreign language] - Having studied indictment of the prosecutor, I wish to ask the accused some questions. [man speaks in foreign language] - [Tamiya] Captain Page. [man speaks in foreign language] - Is it true, that your men fired on one of our police patrol boats, while your junk was flying The Japanese flag? - Yes, some of them did. [Tamiya speaks in foreign language] [man speaks in foreign language] - Is it also true, that you were all disguised, as Malay fishermen? - Some of us were. [men speaking in foreign language] - [Tamiya] Were you carrying out orders from your superiors when you did these things? - Our only orders were to get into Singapore Harbor as best we could. And destroy as many ships and installations as possible. [men speaking in foreign language] - Is it correct that, while carrying out your operation within our territory, your men didn't wear any military insignia or badges of rank? - Yes it is. Right doesn't mean very much to us. - [Tamiya] Well, Jesus. [speaks in foreign language] [man speaks in foreign language] - [Tamiya] Were you ordered not to wear any insignia? - No. We made own decisions. - Yeah. [speaks in foreign language] [airplane engine roaring] Thank you. [man speaks in foreign language] - [Tamiya] Do any of you accused wish to add to the evidence? [Tamiya speaks in foreign language] - I call for the summing up of the prosecutor. [man speaks in foreign language] - Not only you is accused, unanimously admits their guilt, but the statements of the witnesses and other evidence, unpreproved that guilt. [man speaks in foreign language] - [Tamiya] However, the heroism they displayed on this crucial war front is beyond description. [men speaks in foreign language] - They traveled 3000 miles on land and sea with great determination. And overcame incredible hardships to penetrate deep into regions and the Japanese occupation. [man speaks in foreign language] - We do not hesitate to call them, rare heroes. [man speaks in foreign language] - This is a feeling of the Japanese people. [men speaking in foreign language] - It is our duty to ensure, that their names will remain in the hearts of Britains and Australians, for all eternity. [man speaks in foreign language] - I therefore consider, a death sentence should be given to each of these accused persons. [suspenseful music] [man speaks in foreign language] [gavel pounds] - This court will now recess for a period of 30 minutes. [man speaks in foreign language] [suspenseful music] [men speaks in foreign language] [gavel pounds] [man speaks in foreign language] - [Tamiya] The judgment will now be given. [dramatic music] [Tamiya speaks in foreign language] This court, sentences all of the accused to death. [dramatic music] Major Ingleton, would you please issue the order to leave the court? - Captain Page? - Thank you, sir. - Square! Attention! Left turn! Quick march! [boots thudding] [dramatic music] [chains rattling] [man speaks in foreign language] - Thank you. - It's bloody rough I think. - It's espionage we did. - You all knew where we stood on that score. - Well, they didn't say anything about the other raid. - What's the point? Can't hang us twice. - You'll think they'll hang us? - No, more like a firing squad. - Or beheaded. That's their way. - I'll give myself in first. [men speaks in foreign language] [boots thudding] - What's this for? Why are there new clothes? - For you. You are to be executed tomorrow. - How? - By the traditional method of Japanese Bushido. - Beheading? You Jap bastard. - That's enough. Dougie. - Okay, Papa. - Settle down, everyone. Minoru, tell us about Bushido. [dramatic music] - In Samurai society, as a mark of respect due to a person with high status, suicide by Harakiri would be ordered instead of an execution. A second, always accompanies a condemned man, and would cut off his head to ease pain of dying. Thus, the relationship between the man to die and his second was not one of enmity, rather, it was a relationship of reliable and trust and friends. [dramatic music] [chains rattling] - Beheading. I can live without that. - Doesn't make much difference how they do it, dead is dead. - I'd rather go out fighting. - Look, fellas, if dying's all that's left, that's it.
