[upbeat pop music plays] [man] There's a harmonious balance between music and technology... dating back to Jeff Hill in the '50s. Today, with synthesizers, MIDI, and machines like the CMI, the possibilities are limitless. Mark my words. One day, with artificial intelligence, computers will even write music. [Kaela] AI hasn't really gotten there yet for computers to write their own music but with sequencers and samplers like this MPC60, a person can make arrangements that would have taken an entire orchestra before. [anchor] A digital audio workstation gives you everything you need to record an album. And you can do it from a laptop. [woman] It's the democratization of music. And you don't even need a big expensive studio to do it. Any teenager in his mom's basement can record a platinum selling album. [presenter] At this point, listeners are overwhelmed with content. The challenge now is finding what the next big thing will be. What companies like mine are doing with artificial intelligence is really the culmination of technology and music, where we can use metrics on listener behavior and interest to find the next music superstar. [applauding] ♪ [interviewer] Oh, boy. Well, I want to say it started, you know, in the-- the turn of the century, when smartphones really-- really took off. And here we are in 2021, and you can't mention really anything without, you know, being fed, uh, marketing attempts, you know? Pretty interesting, right? Artificial intelligence is cool in theory. I like the way that it's going, but I feel like something about that human interaction and actual people is, you know, where the heart is, and I feel like that's the truth and that's the soul. But I really think that there's room for both. I think it's gonna have both, I just... I don't see AI taking over. AI has already worked its way into content creation. Google has Magenta Project, and Sony has Flow Machines. You see, we have an exclusive license to the Mystic Canyon algorithms, which is gonna catapult us, put us ahead of the game, and you'll see everybody behind us playing catch up. Uh, so my name is Linus Van Lynes. I am the CEO, uh, head developer, creator of Mystic Canyon. We've already had so much success with them, like, version two was our Lil Program, where we found all the Lils, you know? And we based it on the three main Lils which was Lil Jon, Lil Wayne, and Lil' Kim. And then from there, we got all these awesome Lils. Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Dicky, Lil Jimmy, Lil Jimmy Dicky, Lil, uh, Xan. Hip-hop and R&B accounted for nearly a third of all streams in the United States. And I know hip-hop, we're trying to take the guesswork out of it, and that's simply the goal. We believe that-- that there's a gold mine of music out there, from, like, the '90s, early 2000s of bands that, uh, didn't get a shot or were, uh, maybe ahead of their time. We're on version 13. Unlike other, uh, algorithms and-- and programs that we've had before, this one goes for that band or artist that you don't know about, but they could have been a thing. So, maybe they had a small record deal, maybe they had something happening, they have some kind of footprint online that we can find, and boom, access it, and gold for Capitol Records-- more gold. What we like to say in Mystic Canyon is, "It doesn't write the songs, but it rights the wrongs." That's pretty-- that's pretty cool, right? And right now, we are essentially in a beta run. And we have assigned our most talented, uh, A&R rep, Kaela Snoot, you know, to handle the reins. Everything Mystic Canyon goes through me. Um, I am the point person. I report to my boss, Logan. Um, I also report to Linus, which is different and a little strange. But I guess that's just, you know, the way things are going, and they're pushing that way and, uh, I'm just here to get the job done, honestly. I grew up in that era of '90s hip-hop, probably the best era of hip-hop, in my opinion. Snow, "Informer." I don't know what he's saying, That one-- [babbling] Whatever, uh, but, you know, it was-- it was a hit. [interviewer] I'm a product of artificial insemination. So, if you want to talk artificial... I feel confident that I'm your guy. [interviewer] Yeah, I think that we might have an issue. Um, it's been acting wonky, I don't know if it's a glitch. I could show you if you wanna see it. -[interviewer] Please. -Do you wanna see it? Okay. All right, so, can you guys see it? Every-- yeah? Okay, cool, so, hmm... all right. Gonna be-- and then... The Booty Boys, like, what's that? It makes no sense. Watch. No address, no phone number, no management, nothing. This isn't the weird part. Watch. Search again. And it just keeps showing The Booty Boys. No matter how many times I click through it, it just does this, it has no info. I've googled everything, I've looked it up, I've gone through every, I've-- oh, I've gone through it, and the only thing I could find is that they were with HBR, with some sort of-- it was a record label. [interviewer] Yeah, that's what-- that's what we got. You know, I typed in the different demographics, I tried ages, I tried anything to get some other response, but it keeps coming back to The-- The Booty Boys. You wanna know about The Booty Boys? Everything you need to know about The Booty Boys... right here. Booty... is the truth. Bootyology is the future. I want to tell you one word. Good luck.

Originally I had found out that they were a fan of my music, which, um, wasn't super surprising 'cause a lot of people were at that time. I saw these guys at a show, their knowledge of the booty mesmerized me, and I was like, "I gotta meet these guys." I was a mentor to them, you know? I was like that cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I was that one. I'm not good with years, or linear thought so much. So, I-- I think I-- I don't remember how we met, because there was a lot of drugs back then. My apartment was getting fumigated and, uh, after a couple hours I-- I had to get out of there. So, uh, I went down to the old block, and, uh, I was just kind of hanging out, and these two guys are outside, right next to my Pontiac Sunfire. All right? And they are making some noise. And I'm like, "You guys gotta get out of here. This is a strip mall." They were freestyling. I didn't even know what freestyling was, okay?

I couldn't dance, I'm no good at rap, so I sat down, and I read a book. The Booty Boys heard about me because of a book I had written called Booty Hunters. It's about pirates. I was Bootytron 9000. What is Bootytron 9000? Well, you're looking at him right here. Give it up for the Bootytron 9000. [crowd cheering, applauding] I was a robot. I was the top stripper robot in the town. In The Booty Boys, I was queen Bootytifah. I was sometimes a dancer, sometimes a backup singer, and always a performing artist. We would have additional performers like the Bootytron and The Professor on stage, and I would engage with them as well. And usually in a, uh, sexual-seeming, uh, provocative way, uh, extremely sinful. Uh, they put an ad out. I believe it might have been in the Pennysaver, uh, looking for dancers, and at the time, I was a classically trained ballerina, and I was looking to, uh, find more opportunities in the film world, using my skills and talents. It was unpaid, but they were offering nachos, and I like nachos. The-- I believe it was the "Rootie Tootie" video.

Uh, I don't know... why you'd give a robot that much power. I've seen what they can do, all right? They ruin people's lives. Have you heard of Turbotax? [interviewer] No, but for The Booty Boys, he was real. And we needed to keep that belief going in them. I believe The Booty Boys thought Bootytron 9000 was a real robot. [interviewer] Am I a real robot? Are you trying to get me to cry? There was separation. There was Terry... and there was Bootytron 9000. They saw me as Terry. "Homeboy Terry. Hey, what's up?" You know what I'm saying? And they told me about Bootytron. There was one particular conversation, they were like, "Yo, we got this robot, you gotta meet him." And I'm going, "It's me." They thought I was a real robot, to answer your question. I think that the future was, ironically, kind of bright for-- for the fellas. Again, it wasn't my cup of tea, but from the reactions of the crowds at their shows, it seemed like everyone was into it. I'd let them know some of the... incidents I saved them from. The random girls... throwing peas... onto the stage or wanting to, and I had to restrain them. They'd get mad at me, actually, about that. Um, "Why-- why didn't you let them throw the peas?" [interviewer] I mean peas. It was like seeing Jesus, you know? And I saw a great marketing opportunity. You gotta think of marketing. You gotta think of your name being out there. So, you just put these stickers on every booty in the club. Spank, spank, spank spank, spank, spank, spank. Booty Loops! Ah! Booty Loops! Toilet paper, that's obvious. You want clean booty, right? Looking at companies like Amazon and stuff now, Booty Boys could have done that. They could have done all of that. Like, you know, a penis shaped rocket going up? That's-- imagine an ass shaped rocket, they would have done that and they would have-- it would have been incredible. [Rick] The sky was the limit for them. I'm kinda sick about it, actually. You know, it was pretty tragic for me to think that he was gone. And-- and then I lost my husband who was... a big supporter and just, you know, was right there, pushing him on. There was a certain amount of destiny involved with what they were doing. And then on another level, there was no destiny. You know what they say? Music is a game of inches. I'm telling you, The Booty Boys were coming to kill the whole music industry. Who the fuck were these two dudes coming out of nowhere? I mean, The Booty Boys were just a storm. They really were. They were a perfect storm. It-- it was-- I was, uh, I was Mark Wahlberg on a fucking boat, and here came the wave of The Booty Boys, and they just fucking completely wiped out my ship. Music was gonna be fun again, and it was gonna unite the world. They were gonna bring peace to this earth. But that's not gonna happen now, is it? In the pantheon of white rappers, who rap exclusively about women's backsides, The Booty Boys unquestionably rank in the top 15. I really hoped that one day we would be best friends. Like, uh, like Ben Affleck and-- and cocaine. I thought they had a lot of potential. That's why I stuck around with them for so long. They had great beats and though the lyrics were definitely questionable and problematic... ...um, they were catchy. I don't know, he just had this thing about butts, and I never quite understood it, 'cause his dad was a tit man.

They were like, "Let's do it in LA with all--" and I said, "No, you don't want that. You don't want-- what you have to do is get your head out of the game, to get your head in the game." And now, sure, Arizona, in the middle of summer, it was too hot. But these guys were so passionate that they-- they would have recorded in a-- in a Bikram yoga studio. Everything's gone. The recordings are gone. The dub tapes are gone. The monies around "Bootyology," the production costs, everything, seized. Yes. The Federal Bureau of Investigations is looking for me. Now, they accused me of doing a Fonzi scheme. It was not a Fonzi scheme. This was a legitimate label. It was my life. I had passion around that. But with Rick, I always got the feeling I wouldn't-- it's not like I wouldn't take my wallet if I left the room with him, but he's the kind of guy I would not leave my wallet around. I signed these boys. The fact that they disappeared a year later, just a coincidence. They had this crazy, uh, super fan... that I think killed them. He does my taxes now. Kevin. Uh, this one is taken from a distance. These are, uh-- this is a night lens. All right? You saw the stuff, like, in-- like in movies. Like in Predator. Uh, you see stuff like this. I don't know who I am, if I'm using that movie as a reference, I'm not sure who I am in that. Yes, I am familiar with the head of the fan club, Kevin. It's a, um, difficult topic to speak about, but... Kevin was unpredictable. Kevin... was someone I always had to be aware of. It would always surprise me. You know, someone's nighttime routine. You know, when they brush their teeth, do they gargle, do they do some push-ups before they go to bed, stuff like that. brownEye and sixxxHole, they were very normal, unless they felt like they were being watched, and then they got a little cagey and a little timid, uh, and then they would close their doors and windows and blinds and that would be it for me. At every show, every show... Kevin was there. I didn't want to let the fellas on, let them know that-- what type of potential danger they were in, I wanted them to continue doing their job to the best of their ability, so that I could do mine to the best of my ability. And-- but this Kevin character... he was a handful. Uh-- ooh, finally! Ooh. This is one of the big ones. This is a restraining order against me from them. Which... I'll admit, I take as a bit of a compliment... because they were always like, "Hey, make sure you're at least 50 yards." You know? Stay close. Because if we need you, we want you nearby. So, I was always like, "50 yards, you got it, buddy. I'll be there. I'll be there." I don't know-- I don't know what happened to them. I really don't know, I-- I certainly did everything I could to find them. Honestly, I hope they were murdered. I mean, I think that would have been just the easiest, uh, to deal with. They become legends, at that point. Who doesn't want to be a legend? I wish I was murdered. I think they ascended to the bootyverse. I think they were last seen at Budthoulz. It's in the valley, I don't know if you've ever been. The last reported sighting, I believe, was at Budthoulz, which is a bar in the valley. I believe the last time they were seen was in Budthoulz. It's in the valley. Budthoulz. Not that difficult. People couldn't pronounce it, so we had to change the name. And here you find yourself. I've been coming to Budthoulz for about 20 years. [interviewer] The booty what? And I would see The Booty Boys. Wha-- I-- I got things to do. What-- what are we doing here? The night they disappeared, they were celebrating something. I wasn't really paying attention. I was drinking. Uh, I remember there was a lot of festivities going on. There was, well, there was-- there was a couple of particular dudes that were at the end of the bar and-- Later that night, I married brownEye... to a girl. They were giving each other shots, they were interacting. They-- they were very loud. And that's the last I saw of them. [dramatic melody plays] [interviewer] Well, I do have a, uh, a third walk-in in the back. I put all my old German beer back there and my Zima. -[interviewer] -We do. -[interviewer] -Absolutely. -[suspenseful music plays] -Come this way. Here we go. And the third walk-in.

You guys are 40 now. [grunting] So, I've listened to some of your guys' old stuff. They sing about butts. They sing about butts in every song. We gotta catch you up on some things. We don't say "bitch" anymore. We have pronouns. We got her/she, him/he, them/they, but them/they is, like, singular, not the plural. Only grandmas and conspiracy theorists use Facebook. ♪ Up your butt ♪ You missed the first Black president and the first orange president. All she did was sing the word "Friday" a lot, and we destroyed her for it. ♪ Up your butt ♪ But all the white people were like, "All lives matter." He still looks exactly the same as he did in Clueless. ♪ Up your butt ♪ It's called cultural appropriation. It was fucking blue and black, not white and gold. ♪ Up your butt ♪ And that's the basic history of the MeToo movement. So, they put all the old white people brains inside of the Black people. People just watch other people play video games now. RIP Harambe. And that's called mansplaining. I think these guys need to go to the hospital. I think you're right. I'm excited. This is gonna be great. [interviewer] Yeah, she's brought me up to speed. Uh, that The Booty Boys were, you know, frozen for 15 years. But our algorithms found them and I, you know, I-- I trust them. I trust Kaela. You know, we're going to make them the sensation that I believe that they will be. The Booty Boys are found. Uh, Mystic Canyon works-- of course it works.

Whoa! ♪ What's up? Welcome to my house. Come on in. So, I've been living in this house for a couple of days now. Um, it's kind of a weird story. I was frozen, as you know, right? Um, but in my pocket, I found this. Um, I showed it to the people at the hospital and they were like, "Yo, that's a marriage certificate. You're married." And they, uh, contacted the court, found out that my wife lives here and community property or whatever. This is my kitchen. Stay out of the kitchen. I got my very own, um, one of them things, where you, uh, you put your balls in all them holes. -Uh-- -Don't touch the pool table. This is where the magic happens. -Yo! -Absolutely not! -What are you doing in here? -[brownEye] What's up! -God! -This is where it's going down. New wife! Hey, welcome! Welcome to my crib. Check it out. It's a little cozy, um, but this is where I'm living at right now, it's pretty-- it's pretty great. I got, um, this is the-- this is the bathroom. I got, you know, it comes with, like, a toilet brush, a plunger, another plunger, it's, like, two different, like, options because you gotta have options, right? Um, I got a nice-- uh, this is a trash bin, and then I got my kitchen, this is, like, my kitchen setup. This is where I'm making my sandwiches, I'm doing all my creative ideas, I got water running hot and cold, both. I got a drawer, um, I can keep all my stuff in there. This is my bedroom right here. This is where I-- where I sleep. This is where I kick it, where the magic happens, if you know what I mean. Um, I'm gonna just get this out of the way, this is like, uh, it's like kind of like that Eddie Murphy bed, it just kind of goes right back. Um, and then this is the real deluxe spot right here, this is the studio, this is where I have been working on all my tracks. The keyboard is not-- it doesn't, like, have a memory or anything, but, like, I keep the memories up here. And then, like, when I got the good ideas and that's-- that-- I'm just like, I just got it going. Um, and then when I got the vocal ideas, I come over right over here. Check it out, this is my vocal booth AKA the shower, AKA the closet. Um, it kind of does it all, it's just like a really deluxe, multi-purpose space that, um, is-- is working out great for me. I'm-- I'm, you know, I really like where I'm at. Yeah, that's... that, uh, looks like a real marriage certificate is what that looks like. It looks like a... yeah-- so. [interviewer] [sighs] Yeah. When your husband-- let's just get this straight. I-- you could say I'm married to two men, or you could say, "Oh, she did this thing one night at a bar, having dr-- been drinking and made a choice and then he disappeared." In this neighborhood, there's, like, a lot of really cool new things. There's a lady that sells, um, donuts out of the back of her Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. Um, it's like an art supply store and they only sell red paint. There's a guy and he sells, um, yo-yo strings, but no yo-yo's, and it's like, you gotta, like, figure that rest out for yourself. I thought maybe he could kick him out. You know what I mean? As my husband, it feels like the logical next step would be to kick out my other husband. We'll figure it out. No, I mean, see, that's a wishy-washy answer, Brock. I'm not-- I need-- I-- like, I need a plan. He's my buddy. It's gonna be tough. I don't wanna do it. Brock's dope. Brock's dope. I swear to God, if I were gonna marry another woman, who had another husband in addition to me being her husband, I would hope that that woman, her husband was Brock. You know, I've been-- been working, um, as a sandwich artist. Um, not-- not at Subway, but-- but, like, I'm independent sandwich artist, so, it's like more-- there's more artistry to it. Um, apparently, there was, like, a raccoon that lived here before me. Um, but then, and now I'm-- I'm here, and, like, I get to, um, go into, like, the garden, and, like, pick vegetables. Um, like, they said that was cool, because the raccoon also did that. So, like, I get to, like, pick vegetables and put it-- I get to make them into sandwiches. Um, so that's pretty tight. [interviewer] The album was called Bootyology. I don't have a super clear recollection of recording the album. I know that we went to Arizona. That shit was fire. That shit was hot. Um, and the music was good too. I'm a little disappointed with what happened with the album. Um, I'm pretty sure, like, it was, like, an instant classic. It made me really sad to hear that, um, Rick is, um, you know... some sort of criminal mastermind, and the, um, CIA or whatever has our record. No one's ever gonna hear it. It-- it just, like, is in a vault somewhere, in, like, the government, or whatever, with, like, the-- the Ark of the Covenant. Are my lyrics misogynistic? Misogynistic. Mis-- I don't know what you're saying. [interviewer] Yo, I'm having sex with my new wife, Becky. All the time. Dude, she's crazy, too. We are never having sex. Ever. She's shy. [whispering] We're this close. I-- I wanna reach out to brownEye but, like, I-- I don't have a charger for my phone, so, like, it's not working and, like, I don't know how else to-- to get ahold of him. I tried to call sixxx. Um, Becky gave me, um, her phone. Well, I-- so, I wouldn't say she gave it to me, but I found it, and I tried to use it and, um... so, phones now, they're just-- have you seen that shit? There's like, it's-- there's nothing on it. So, there's no-- there's actually no way to make a call on them anymore. I haven't talked to anybody except, like, when I walk by here, and I got this place. [interviewer] No, I haven't talked to my mom. Like, I don't even know-- I don't know if she knows that like-- [interviewer] Yeah-- I-- can I-- can I-- can I borrow a charger or something? Do you guys have-- do you-- -[interviewer] Yes. -Okay. If I had to think about, like, what my dad wanted... [sniffles] ...my-- my pops, like, he said, you know, "You-- you always gotta be strong, um... and, like, carry yourself like a-- a president." And, uh, he also said that all the presidents' nicknames were about their dicks. [interviewer] I mean, you know... once a booty boy, always a booty boy. So there's no, you know, do I want to return to The Booty Boys? I'mma-- I-- it's-- I'm returned already. Um, but, you know, sometimes you gotta, you know, take a-- take a look at your life, um, and your pool and all your stuff, and be, like, "Maybe-- maybe this is where I am, you know? Maybe this is where I belong." I feel like I am 100% a booty boy, and I don't think that I need to return. I feel like I am still living it, I'm breathing it, I am it. And I'm... I'm-- I just can't wait to get in the studio, I don't know how that's gonna happen. I mean, obviously, I got a studio here, but, like, maybe something that has a microphone. And then-- and then, yeah, I mean, I'm-- I'm ready. I'm ready. I got the ideas going. ♪ So, we've been running around, because we just got The Booty Boys' contract. So, we're excited, feeling positive. It was expensive, but, uh, we'll be in the studio tomorrow. Feels like, you know, part of... my brain is, you know, maybe still frozen a little. But, um, you know, I can use all my arms and legs. I feel like my mind is a little foggy. Um, you know, I think it's probably just 'cause I didn't sleep well, like, my living situation isn't 100% ideal. I miss him. I'm-- I miss my pool at home also, though, and my hot new wife. I mean, for me, it's, you know, I-- I wanna get out of that bathroom. I'll just be straight up. It's like a triangle of emotion. And Brock, so it's like a triangle with four sides. I'm really excited to see brownEye. I mean, like, we-- we are, like, best friends and bros and like father and son all rolled into one. For the first few days, Becky was really standoffish. Like, she didn't seem to really want me around. He's like a lyrical genius, you know? His-- his flow and his word play is amazing. This morning she told me she wants to do anal. He's like, you know... ♪ Tic-tac-toe, three in a row ♪ ♪ I'mma be a X if you be my hoe ♪ She gave me this, which, um... I think it's one of those consent forms that, um, Kaela was talking about. ♪ We could add one mo' and we could connect fo' ♪ ♪ Because I'm pretty sneaky, sis' ♪ ♪ When I slip in the back door ♪ This is the-- the decree of analment, which means, uh, once I sign this, you know, it's on. What's up? So, what do you got for the new album? A'ight, so, I was thinking of a song about a really big butt. And I'm gonna call it, "Really Big Butt." Oh, that's the whole idea? [brownEye] Yeah, it's gonna be dope. [sixxxHole] I mean, that's a great start. That is a great start, but this has to be the greatest rap album of all time. Can't it just be a rap album of all time? Couldn't Pablo Picasso just painted the ceiling of the 16 chapels white and called it a day? Couldn't Bruce What's-his-face been like, "No worries," and not turned into the Hulk? The only reason we remember those guys' names is 'cause they did something great. Like that one chick and those 500 dudes. Sometimes you gotta paint a bunch of babies on the ceiling or on someone's face, for people to give you respect. -It's gonna be great. -[sixxxHole] How do you know? Because our old music was great, so, our new music will-- Oh, I just had a great idea! What if we just take our old songs that never came out, and put those out? -That shit was hella tight. -Oh, that's tight! -Tight! -Tight! Let's do it.

And-- and what do you think? I thought it was really, really, really terrible. Like, garbage. Like, I would actually rather listen to someone banging on the garbage cans. -Like, stop. -Ah, stop. No. I'm saying you made me nauseous. You have a song called "Ass Clamor." "Shake Bread." And "Booty Hats?" Like, what the f-- it doesn't even rhyme! -[Carol] Shh! -Okay, Carol. Shh! I think you're missing the subtleties. Yeah, it's-- it's all about subtext and subterfuge. And submarines and subtitles. Let me mansplain to you what we were going for. -You see-- -[Kaela] Don't bother. This album has cost us $15 million already. Did you play it for anybody else? I deleted the files you sent. I deleted the emails you sent, I deleted the email address you sent it to. So hopefully, nobody ever finds this. Just make something better. Oh, man. I don't know why this is so fucking hard now. It's like we used to be so good at this. We were like Rizzoli and Isles. Well, don't worry about it, man. It's gonna be fine. Maybe we need some help. Something's just not clicking. I told my boss, but he really wants us to keep moving forward, so we're gonna move forward. You know, there's a right way, and there's a wrong way. I mean, do you want to be Eminem or do you want to be Chet Hanks? The choice is yours. They just gotta thaw their little brains and vocal chords out, and, uh, we'll slap a few beats on it and The Booty Boys... you know, they're not gonna make an ass of me. [laughs] That's fucking rich. Hi, I'm Doctor Claudia Yang, state licensed therapist and also marriage counselor. I'm also a doula. Oh, I also teach yoga. Uh, oh, actually, I'm a sleight-of-hand artist as well, but only for birthdays and special occasions. I don't need to be here. I know all my rhymes. Most of my-- I know some of my rhymes. Right now, things are just not clicking and we, you know, our-- our beats are not working. The rhymes aren't there. My philosophy on rhyming is that two words have to connect in some way or another. So, like, you might say "bear" and "ball" don't rhyme, but I say they both start with "B," so fuck you. I have a lot of experience with these types of things. I've worked with lots of sports teams, bands, drum circles. I've worked with a Sum 41 cover band-- Some of Sum 41. Creative differences can arise in many different types of teams. You know, the causes can vary from one case to another, but, um, let's see if we can spark something today. Let's take a look at these images. Tell me what comes to mind when you see this. I know this one. A butt. Uh, a butt. Interesting, you both see butts. [both] All the time. What do you see when you see this image? Oh, that's, uh, it's, like, four dicks with, like, two weirder dicks coming out of the top and then I-- I mean, they're like little dicks that are kind of just on the side. Squiggly dicks. Okay, okay. Let's try something else. Let's try something else. Let's take a look at these images. These are a little less abstract. Tell me what comes to mind when you see this. A house. A dick-- dick house? A Brick dick? Brick dick ho-- A brick dick house? Okay, uh, let's try this. You-- you definitely will recognize this-- -Napkins. -To-- to-- toilet paper? This is value. Greek yogurt. All right. Well, let's move on to this one. -Oh, Gary. -Yes, yes. Did you have a cat named Gary? What are you talking about? Yeah, why are you trying to confuse us? The pictures aren't working here. I feel like I'm missing something. Honestly, that went better than I thought. I got to look at a bunch of pictures. She showed us some horseshoe tests, and I saw five butts and six dicks, and the dicks were coming out of the butts. It was-- Fuck, man. Have you recently experienced a traumatic event? -I downloaded TikTok. -That's not traumatic. It's, like, the coolest thing ever. You just have to go to the For You page-- And once you download the app, if you don't go to the first-- I mean, a recent life-altering event. Honestly, things have been pretty okay ever since we were unfrozen. -You were frozen? -Yeah. Uh, only for like 15 years though. We were both frozen inside Budthoulz. -It's-- it's in the Valley. -That's it! This is clearly a case of selective memory loss as a result of... PTFD. [both] Oh, PTSD. PTFD. Post Traumatic Freeze Disorder. -Can you mansplain it to us? -Yeah. Can I? I wrote the book on that. [chuckles] No, really. I wrote the book on that. It's on Amazon. It's called Mansplaining: A Man's Perspective from a Woman's Perspective. Part of the amygdala has remained frozen, causing selective memory loss, which will thaw over time, bringing memories rushing back to the prefrontal cortex causing sudden cognition at unexpected moments. I've only ever read about it in books, and in those cases, they were cats and dogs and one donkey. I'm excited to have a diagnosis, because when people are like, "No, sir, you have to leave the store," I'm like, "Oh, but it's because of PTFD," and so, like, that to me is really helpful. Um, and they're like, "You--" you know, "Put your pants on," and I'll be like, "Yeah, that's cool," but, like, now I have a reason. This is so exciting. I want you guys to try something. You'll need two. Take a long, slow inhale... [inhales audibly] ...exhale... [exhales audibly] ...and squeeze your balls. [both laughing] What? -What? -What? Try it. It may help you focus and bring back those memories. [both breathing audibly] See? It's not as easy as it looks, is it? Did we have... [both] A DJ? [dramatic hip-hop beat playing] ♪ You step to me [indistinct] ♪ ♪ That all I want is that B-O-O-T-E ♪ My name is DJ Backdoor. I was The Booty Boys' original DJ. ♪ DJ Backdoor ♪ [audience cheering] I don't know anything about deejaying. Like, I-- I know how to change a CD. I know how to hit play, I know how to hit pause. Um, but that's about it. I was at a party. There was a sick CD changer, you know, those cool ones that go all the way around and you can actually change the CD while one is playing. I was just helping keep the party going. And these two guys, they run up to me and they go, "Oh, my God, dude, that was amazing." I-- I don't know if I do a good impression of them, but that's about what they sounded like. We got to talking, and, uh, it was mostly about butts, sure, um, but it was a Hollywood party, so there was lots to talk about. And by the end of the night, they had convinced me that I was, uh, the DJ for their band. So that's-- that's how I became a member of The Booty Boys. Uh, as much as I didn't like rap music, um, I thought The Booty Boys were amazing. Uh, it was-- it was just great. Uh, and so, yeah, I-- I never wanted it to end. [interviewer] It started like any other. Uh, we were very excited about it. Uh, it felt like it was going to be a bigger show. In fact, when we got there, people were already there, uh, which doesn't happen that often. sixxxHole was-- was eating Pringles, and, um, he got-- he got to the last few, and, um... he-- he asked for help, and of course I jumped in. Stuck-- stuck my hand all the way down the can. Got my hand stuck. He was just trying to be helpful. He-- he pulled on the can. The thing kind of ripped apart, kind of pulled out at my hand at the same time. I'm not exactly sure the extent of the damage, but there was blood. It was my CD changing hand, and how-- how was I gonna perform? So immediately, the two guys, um, started looking for somebody, anybody, that could do what I could do. Um, I went to the bathroom, uh, to clean up, just try to fix what I could. By the time I got out of the bathroom, the show had already started. I didn't know how. I didn't know who they found, but I got there, out onto the floor, and I heard what was going on, a-- and it was incredible. [interviewer] Uh, I mean, that-- that was DJ #2. They are so much better without me. Uh, DJ #2, uh, is who they always needed and still need. Man, I'm feeling-- I'm feeling really good about today, you know. Yeah. I mean, after the therapy, we had some time to reflect and, you know, kind of get our shit together. And I think we got some good stuff going. Yeah, we got some dope music. We got, like, some really creative songs. Like, I just feel like everything's starting to flow. I think people are gonna really feel this album, like, I-- I just-- I ju-- can just sense it. I'm thinking this session is going to be fire. ♪ Jim jiminy, bibidi bibidi bibidi ♪ ♪ Ass like a chimney ♪ Stop. [sixxxHole on autotune] What-- what do you guys think? [sixxxHole] Do you-- do you like when I go up on that? Is that-- do you like that part when I go like... [vocalizes] Why don't you come out of the booth real quick? Yeah. Thanks. [brownEye] Yeah. No, I think it's coming together. -Yeah, do you? -[brownEye] Uh-huh. Yeah, you do? -Just got off to a slow start. -[Kaela] Yeah. We're working through it. -Yeah, you guys feel good? -Yeah. -[brownEye] Yeah. -Great, great, awesome. So, fellas, I don't know what's going on, but this album's not coming together. You got no bops, no bangers, and none of this is gonna work on TikTok. And then I come in here, and you shit in my earholes for three hours with nothing real to show for it. And now... [laughs] ...you have me saying things like "shit in my earhole," -which is-- -Which is dope. Shit in my earholes. -I'mma use that. -No, you're not. I need the next "Back that Ass Up,' "Drop It Like It's Hot," "Pop, Lock and Drop It." You guys need to sell more copies than Lady Gaga. -Period. -[laughing] Lady Gaga? Is that some kind of baby food? -Gaga. -Gaga. Of course you guys don't know who she is. This is-- this is awesome. This is really great, okay. So, let me make this clear for everyone in here with traumatic brain injuries. Hmm? Everything that you're doing here is bad. I need you to make music that's good. Well, it's-- it's not my fault. This guy still doesn't remember how to rhyme. -[Kaela] What? -At least I use real words. Well, at least I'm not living off my wife's husband's money. -Your beats suck. -Your face sucks. -Your mom sucks. -Well, you're old. So are you, Robbie Van Winkle. I don't know why I thought we could make it like the old days. -We can't do it. -[Kaela] Yes, you can! -It's over. We're breaking up. -[Kaela] No, you're not. -We gotta break up. -[Kaela] No, you're not. -Yeah. I agree. -[Kaela] No. Yeah. Well, get out of here. [brownEye] I'm sick of your stupid old face anyway. Well, I'm sick of your entitled old ass anyway. -Yeah. -Get the fuck out of here. [Kaela] Forever young. -We're all young. -Yeah. Go. [brownEye] No, I'm-- we're done. [Kaela] We're great. We're great. We're great. We're young. Forever young. I know they didn't just quit on me. [somber music playing] I don't know why, um, sixxx is so upset that I ca-- can't rhyme. Everything just falling apart. It's-- it's hard, but, you know, I think I-- I think I'll-- I'll be all right. Like, I got my sandwich thing that I'm doing, and my, uh... You know, I'm applying for jobs online. Hopefully, something comes through, you know, I'm gonna be all right. I don't know why rhyming is so important to be a rapper, you know? Like, if you're Shaquille O'Neal, you don't have to slam dunk every hour of the day. I've worked for so long to make this. And then, obviously, there was, like, some time where I was not working, but that was 'cause I was frozen. Or if you're, like, a shoe repair guy, you're not like, "Hey, are your shoes okay?" to everyone you see. "Let me see those shoes. Are they working all right for you?" Sometimes life is hard. And I've been filling so many holes in my life. I haven't told sixxx yet, but... that wasn't, um, a consent form I signed, I guess. Um, it was an annulment... if you pronounce it that way. It means a pretty different thing. You know, my mom always wanted me to be a doctor. She wanted me to be a lawyer, an accountant... potato farmer... greeter at IKEA. But my dad, he always wanted me to be a Booty Boy. I guess, you know, this is it. This the end of The Booty Boys. You know, life is just weird like that. Like, sometimes you think that you're going somewhere and next thing you know, it's just, like, a dead end. You gotta turn around and-- What the fuck, man? What are you-- what are you idiots doing in my car? Get out. I guess we just have to tell Kaela it's over. Yeah, let's go. So you got kicked out, huh? Yeah, it's all right though. -[sixxxHole] Hey. -Hey. I don't know why we're trying to do this. We're, like, 60 years old trying to rap about butts. We're just gonna go our separate ways and forget about making this album. -Fine with me. -[scoffs] Well, unfortunately, that's not fine with me. Look, we can't do this without a DJ. -Yeah. -Well, it turns out that DJ Backdoor has no musical talent, and we can't find DJ #2 anywhere. We need DJ #2. I know behind every great rapper is a great DJ. Like Eminem and Dr. Dre or Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince. Or like Slim Kid Tre and Brian Austin Green. Okay. Look, the point is, we can't track him down. I mean, we don't have any information on what his real name is or where he's at. And we can't sit and wait till we find him. Well, maybe we could hire a private investigator. Or the Ghostbusters. We've already tried one of those things, and unfortunately, we've come up with nothing. There's just no way we can do this without him. [sighs] We need all three of us. We want to have a threesome. And if you can't do that, then he's right, we're out. No threesome, no album. Mic drop. Actually, there's no threesome, and there's no breaking up. Between your studio time, your therapy, your PTFD treatments, and the food budget, this is the second most expensive album of all time. Damn. Who's got the first most expensive? Michael Jackson. Yeah. But, you guys, the point is you're contractually obligated to finish this album, okay? I put all of my eggs in this basket, so we're gonna mix that shit up and we're gonna make a fucking scramble. I put my eggs in someone's basket before. -[The Booty boys laughing] -What? No. You guys, I wish we could find DJ #2 because you only have a song and a half, but we can't pretend like he's just gonna walk through the door and save the day. Holy shit. Woo! Linus? What are you doing here? [laughs] I can't believe it actually worked. Guys, it's-- it's me, Linus. Nah. You guys don't know him? How about now? No. Uh, hang on. [both breathing audibly] [sixxxHole] No. -[brownEye] No. -Okay, I got it. [clippers buzzing] It's me, DJ #2. [both] Oh, shit! [sixxxHole] #2! -DJ #2! -[sixxxHole] Bro! So, my name is Linus Van Lynes. I am DJ #2. When The Booty Boys disappeared, it was awful. It was, like, one of the most awful times in my life. Just when I thought, like, before, when I was a kid, I was lonely, now I knew what it was like to have friends. I knew what it was like to make dope music. And it was stripped, like, it was, like, taken away from me so fast, and it felt really shitty. There was a lot of joy I did get out of Mystic Canyon, and I want you to know, I want everyone to know, that Mystic Canyon is real. Like, uh, my Lil Algorithm or the Yung Algorithm, all these programs, 100% legit. I made a version that would link to The Booty Boys. When you guys came to me about making a documentary, I said, well, boom, I got-- I got eyeballs on what I'm doing. So now I'm gonna launch what then became version 13, as you know, and, uh, and that was the sole purpose of it, was to find The Booty Boys. You got here just in time for us to break up. -What? -Yeah, it's over. I'm probably gonna try and get Becky to take me back, and sixxx is gonna open a sandwich. Shop. A sandwich shop. Yeah, sorry, bros. No threesome for us. [interviewer] I didn't want to tell you I was DJ #2 because, honestly, I don't think you would take me seriously. Once you know who The Booty Boys are, and, you know, you know brownEye, sixxxHole, DJ Backdoor and you're in the Bootyverse, then you go, "Oh, DJ #2, that makes sense." But if I just came to you on the street and I was like, "Hi, nice to meet you, I'm DJ #2," you'd be like, "Okay, I'm DJ Get the fuck out of here." Right? So, like, I-- I-- I wasn't gonna say that. I definitely wasn't gonna lead with that with you guys. I wouldn't say that I'm a manipulator. I would say I'm more of an orchestrator. Like-- like, bringing things to life, like, finding things in music that you maybe didn't think was there before, and I think Kaela's found that. And I don't think she's going to be mad at me for-- for finding all of this. Are you fucking kidding me? Why would you do this to me? What did I ever do to you? Look, I could have been in the studio with Megan Thee Stallion for the last three months, but instead I'm here with these fucking Encino men. Why would you do this? Just so you can find your... butt boys? I was a lonely kid. And I spent my days listening to hip-hop, programming and playing video games by myself. And then I grew up, and I listened to hip-hop, programmed, played video games all by myself. Then The Booty Boys came along and they changed everything. They didn't care what I looked like or what car I drove. They liked me for me. And then when DJ Backdoor couldn't play that Viper Room show, you know, I stepped right in and I pressed play like I've never pressed play before. We rocked the fucking thongs off that club. And they called me DJ #2, but I felt like friend #1. And then they disappeared. I was devastated. I mean, I poured myself into my work, just like you do. And all of a sudden, I'm taking all this hot fudge and whipped cream and-- and spoonfuls of everything and making someone else's hot fudge sundae when I wanted to make my own hot fudge sundae for my friends. So that's why I have this chain right here with these three spoons on it. You know, and you might have felt like I wasted millions of your dollars trying to find my friends, but you know what? You found one of the greatest rap duos of all time. I used to have fake friends with fake names like Mario and Luigi. And now I have real friends... with real names like sixxxHole and brownEye. You know, it's not about the money, it's not about the algorithms. It's about friendship. And I know you may hate me, and you have every right to pull the plug, but they need to make an album. No. We need to make an album. But let's do it the right way. Now, let's make some butt songs!

We finished it. No, seriously, uh, what's this? It's a CD. Oh. Okay. I'm gonna go digitize this. -Yeah. Please. [laughs] -Yeah. Thanks. Yo, what can I say? We did it! -Yeah, it's done. -We finished the album. Kaela is, like, mad smart. Like, she taught us so much about, like, the world today and what it means to be, like, a human being. -You know, it's like-- -Not just a human being, but, like, a good human being, right? Yeah. We want all the world to just, you know, feel good about their sexuality and their choices and the-- and their love. Like, this is about love and making love. Everybody likes butts and everybody likes sex and everybody likes fun, and we still put that all together into, like, a pot and make you the booty soup you're looking for. It's not just about choosing words that rhyme with each other. You might say a word and then there's an obvious rhyme that is, like, a word that is not respectful to another person. Sometimes, you just have to think a little bit harder and think, like, "Maybe I should just think of a different word to call that person." Like "woman." So, I heard The Booty Boys' new stuff, and, um, I mean, they're still rapping about booties. It's, like, same-same different, you know? It's like Now and Laters and Starburst, you know? It's a little bit different. Um, but they're still rapping about butts, but I mean, who cares? I mean, we all have a butt, men, women, babies, old people, young people, Black, White. So, we don't have to be embarrassed or ashamed of our bodies. You know, we can love ourselves and respect ourselves. Not everyone has to have the same perspective. You know, some people might find this offensive, but some people might find it liberating. There's room for everybody, we just need to learn to respect each other and-- and grow and learn from each other. And I'm actually really excited about this new music. You know, I feel like The Booty Boys are true to themselves and that's something to be proud of, so... Man, this is gonna be awesome. [chuckles] [mellow guitar melody playing] The new album is hella tight. It really is. I mean, I-- it's gotta be doing crazy numbers at this point. -Hey! -[The Booty Boys] Hey! -Are you guys ready? -[The Booty Boys] Yeah. -[sixxxHole] Let's do it! -All right. Okay. So, really, how do you think we did? Well, after accounting for the, uh, trip to the Cayman Islands and the private jet charter and the snacks and the medical bills and finding you two and buying out your contract, the budget is currently at... 214 million. -What? -[sixxxHole] Oh, shit. We have the most expensive album of all time! We beat Michael Jackson! Oh, he's gonna be so mad at us. Oh, man, I'm so glad we spent all that money. 214 million? That means just to break even on this record, we're gonna have to stream 535 billion copies. That's easy, we're gonna have like 535 kajillion copies. Yes. All right. We are in... All right. -So, we've got.. -[computer dings] ...846... that's it. 846. 846? I don't know how that happened. I mean, there's more than 846 people that work in this building, so... I listened to that album, like, 845 times myself. [sighs, smacks lips] Uh, you know, it was-- it was a gamble, sure, to unfreeze two old men and hope that they were gonna be as, you know, as good as advertised. Uh, I g-- I guess I couldn't control that, but I gambled, uh, that-- that I could have controlled. Yeah, I mean, 846 is not going to do it. It's-- I mean, we're definitely not gonna recoup anytime soon with that. I m-- I mean, like, 846, if we just did that, like, this week and then next week maybe, like, it would-- and then-- -Another 846. -846, yeah, right. -Like, just-- -846 the week after that. And we could just keep doing that until-- One after the other, 846, 846-- That would take 12 million years, by the way. -12 million. -Let's do it! You know, well, uh, back to the drawing board-ish, you know, if you-- you know what I mean? Mystic Canyon, we-- we'll see who's really to blame if it was the ones and zeros or it was Lonely Linus. I can't say that I'm worried about Kaela, you know? She works hard. She knows what she's looking for and she'll find it. But, uh-- and me, I'm already moved on. You know, I'm looking-- I'm looking at a new band that goes by the name of Plausible Deniability. [laughs] How is that slice of irony? Table of one. Logan Oceanak. Whatever. I'll be fine. 200 mil? That's a-- that's a-- that's a night in Bali. You know, we can only grow from this. We gotta move forward. I gotta stay positive because I did the work I was asked to do, you know? I did everything that I could to make this great. You know, this is the beginning of our story. You know, you can't-- you can't judge the end at the beginning, like, "Oh, no. Goldilocks is in a house with all these bears. The end." She's fucked." Like, you gotta wait till the end. And then everyone's eating oatmeal. This is not the end for The Booty Boys. It can't be the end for The Booty Boys. This is not how The Booty Boys end. No, this-- this isn't it. This is not the end for The Booty Boys. ♪ Hey! ♪ ♪ Oh, Booty hole rangers ♪ [DJ #2] That's how I do it. ♪ Booty hole rangers ♪ [DJ #2] That is how I do it. ♪ Booty hole rangers ♪ ♪ Booty hole rangers ♪ ♪ Stretch your booty like elastic ♪ ♪ Mr. Fantastic ♪ ♪ How hot could that ass get? ♪ [clanging, warbling on computer] [music stops] [atmospheric electronic music playing] -What? -[shutter clicking] Sorry I'm late. [chuckles] No one told me that this was going on. [laughing] Uh, but I figured it out. I figured it out. Let's get some vodka Redbulls going. I can't have caffeine, but, uh, everyone else, get on it, okay? We made the most expensive album of all time, which turned into the most expensive flop of all time. They let me go, so, um, I was a free agent for a while, but it pushed me to be who I wanna be and do what I wanna do. I now own my own label called Snooty Tunes. I'm super passionate about it, I'm super excited about it, and my first act is The Booty Boys that I signed. And now I'm just here to support them on their newest endeavors. Even though we fell, like, 534,999,999,154 albums short of making our money back, we realized that this is all we really needed. [brownEye] Without our friends, our fans, there never could have been The Booty Boys. I mean, where would we be without The Booty Boys, right? -We're a family. -Yeah. And we couldn't imagine sharing this moment with anybody else. Even me? Even you, Father Greg. It turns out I actually read the annulment papers that my wife gave me, and she left me like $13 million, which I think is a lot, and that's how we were able to open Buttholes, only this time we spelled it right. [crowd cheering] Yeah, I mean, we've been in Budthoulz so many times, but opening our own Buttholes is like a whole new experience. This has been a journey for all of us in this. We're learning from each other, and I really feel like we're gonna continue to grow and I feel like they're gonna continue to talk about butts, but in a more respectful way. [voice cracking] I mean, it's a-- it's an amazing experience to be with your boys again. You know? Just getting to be with people after spending so much time isolated. Just stuck in the cold. Getting back, getting in front of the mic... talking about butts. Shit, what else could I ask for? [sobs] I just wish that there were people in my life that could see it today. When I'm talking about those asses, they know. They know who I'm talking about. They know what asses I'm talking about. The whole world's asses. I mean, what can you say, right? Like, how many people have experienced what we've experienced? It's us and a donkey. I feel like we're onto something good, you know? The future is bright. The Booty Boys are the greatest booty rap duo out of Los Angeles ever. We started at the bottom and we just stayed focused on the bottom. I think back then I thought, "We're gonna do this butt thing. We're gonna make a bunch of money. Then I'm gonna be on, like, an island or a boat or in a plane constantly flying around the world, never landing."

A couple of things like Chuck Norris and Tom Selleck exchanged mustaches in the bathroom. Someone filled all of the toilets with Jell-O and no one even noticed. That show was so good, it made Destiny's Child break up. There was an actual ghost there. I know this because he was doing coke in the bathroom with my teaching assistant. I saw them levitate. There were MFers everywhere using H, E, G. I bet there were a bunch of key parties afterward. I bet. I mean, that's what I think about. Um, I'd lost my car at this point, so I didn't have keys. I heard they had all the beats blessed by Pope John Paul II, uh, before the show. Do you remember the band Veruca Salt? -[interviewer] Yeah. -Yeah. Good band, right? -[interviewer] Yeah. -Yeah. Anyway, back to the Viper Room show. After the show, I delivered a baby, and that baby was Honey Boo Boo. Eight new sexual positions were invented that night. Including the Wonderful Executive, the Golden Parachute, Two Men Playing Baseball, Harper Valley PTA, the Build-A-Bear, the Rescue Dog, the Magic School Bus, the 12-layer Dip, the Shave and a Haircut. ♪ Get closer to your Bootyology degree ♪ ♪ Yo, Bootyology ♪ ♪ Educate with booty ability ♪ ♪ Yo, definitely ♪ [DJ Backdoor] Come on.
