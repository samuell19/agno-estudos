He owns an import export business right here in Los Angeles. - I know this guy. We took a look at him last year on a tip. His business is clean. - That's right, his import business is clean but his real business is running drugs, lots of them. And he's only gonna get bigger and more powerful unless we stop him. - Rodchenko's creating a new Russian mafia. - And he's hiring ex-KGB to buy and distribute all over the west coast. - KGB? - That's right. Because of Glasnos they're running around like loose cannons looking for scores. - So what's your plan agent White? - Catch Rodchenko in the act. He's got a major buy going down with his new recruits. These guys are pros, real pros. I got an informant working inside.

He's not the same anymore, he doesn't talk to me. - Maybe it's the job, it can do that to you. - No, no it's not the job, he's married to the job not me. Overtime, double shifts, we never see each other. No he's strange it's... - I'll talk to him. - No, Kevin no, no that'll, that'll only make it worse. Come on, let's go see your dad. Guess who's here. - Hello dad. - Kevin, oh God. The DEA people keeping you busy? - Yeah. - Here.

You need some help with these Russians you let me know alright? - I think I have everything under control, thanks. - I think you'd be better off letting Jack help. I mean he has an eye for these things, don't you Jack? - Why don't you have another drink pop? - No I think I'll turn in instead. - Hey, let me give you a hand with-- - Hell no, thanks.

(dramatic music) (door bangs) (dramatic music) - Andre we are running out of time. I need to know exactly when and where the buy is taking place. - Yes, yes I'm meeting with Nico tonight. But if Nico find out what I do then he kill me for sure. - Nothing will happen to you okay? Look you're not wearing a wire, I've kept surveillance off Nico, unless you open your mouth there's no reason for him to suspect you. Okay? I give you my word Andre. - Thank you.

You see, because of him the police know all about your little deal. Why do you think I'm here? - Who's this man? Looks like a cop. - He's a buyer. - A buyer? - [Andre] Yes. - You've made business deals on your own now? - No Nico of course not, you don't understand. (chuckles) - The photos were taken this morning. The other man in the picture's a Drug Enforcement Agent, your boy is working for him. - That is a lie, he is a liar! - Shut! You sell me to the cop? (gun firing) (thuds) - He was getting away. Now, without my help, your little business deal is gonna get you busted. - And what is it exactly that you want sargent White? - Oh a small percentage. An even one million dollars. (chuckles) - One million. - Keep the police off your back. Which won't be easy once they find out their informants missing. - And what if I choose to expose you? (chuckles) - Well, then it's gonna be your word against mine. And mine carries a little more weight with the police department. So, do we have a deal? - You've got balls sargent, I like that. So we have a deal. - Good. I'll be in touch. (pats) Good work. (door thuds) (dramatic music) (engine rumbles) - Come on Andre. (electronic beeping) - Hey, hey! Key mother fucker, I'm taking the car.

(guns clicking) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (clinking) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (whirring) (crinkling) (speaking foreign language) Rodchenko. (crackling) - We have bad news. The police department's in on it now. Joint task force. - What? - Andre's homicide happened in their backyard, section 139A says we can't move on Rodchenko without them. - What next? - Lieutenant Evans is expecting us. (knocks) - I know why you're here Jack the answer's no. This is a joint task operation and team work isn't exactly your specialty. - I want in on it. - I'm well aware of who your brother is sargent, but this isn't your area. - Come on lieutenant. You need good people on this. Now I'm asking you as one professional to another. - Alright Jack but I don't want any cowboy stuff on this you hear me? - You got it. - So what are you working on a double region one? - Why don't you ask him? What are you doing here? - He's part of the team. You don't have a problem with that do you agent White? Good, then let's continue. We're gonna put Rodchenko under 24 hours surveillance. - We don't wanna scare him off. - That's the first think Rodchenko'd be expecting after what's conspired. - Do we have any idea how the drugs are coming in? - Not yet but Rodchenko can't afford to sit on 'em either. - Alright here's how this'll work. I'll run the operation from here, special agent White you'll be first in charge in the field. You two can work together since you get along so well. - I prefer to work with my own team. - Whether you like it or not agent White, Andre Asinoff's homicide placed us first in charge. So you can either get with the program or you can pack your bags and head back to D.C. (snaps) (clatters) - This was my case Jack. You want another medal use somebody else not me. - What the hell's the problem with us partnering up? Look you wanna lead Kevin, I'll follow. - Don't fuck with me on this Jack, understand? - Yeah, so where are we going? - A funeral. - A funeral, why? - Andre had a sister. - Hey I gotta change my clothes. I'll meet you downstairs in a minute. (clicking) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Yeah it's me. Look you're gonna be watched around the clock. Wire taps'll be set up within the hour. - Right. - We're checking Andre's sister. - She will not talk. - Just watch your ass Nico. - [Nicolai] But I have you to do that for me.

Why are you bothering my family? - Who am I? I'm the guy that's gonna nail your ass. - I think not. - Think again. - Let's get outta here. - Listen to your friend and leave this place. - Let's go, now. Come on. - Get your hands off me Jack! - Oh, well, what're you gonna do in there Kevin huh? Kill the guy? Blow the whole deal? That'd be real good, that's smart thinking. Let's move along that track. (suspenseful music) (crying) - Let me drive you home. - No, please, no. - Come on. (crying) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - [Jack] This is a wasted trip Kevin. Andre's sister is not gonna talk. Rodchenko's got her spooked. - Maybe. You know I've been thinking, maybe we could get dad to join AA. - Pop admit he's got a drinking problem? Forget about it. Besides Lori and I've already tried. - It seems to be getting worse. - Now don't you think I know that? - Well maybe there's something we can do about it. - You know big, bright college boy comes into town and got the answers for everybody's problems right Kevin? - Oh Jack come on, give me a break. You know the same blood runs through your veins that runs through mine. - Okay fine. Why don't you let pop come live with you? (doors banging) Anything else you wanna get off your chest? - Yeah Lori's real concerned about you. - Yeah well that's between Lori and me and not you alright? - Listen all I'm saying is Jack, don't let your career take precedent over your family that's all. - Jesus, can we go inside? (horn honks) Thank you. (dramatic music) - Let's go. (dramatic music) - Hey, we are closed.

Mia I wanna help you. - The way you helped my brother? - Do you remember me? (snaps) Cockroach. - Oh shit. (whacking) (crying out) - Wait here? (dramatic music) (whacking) (crying out) - You want a piece of me? Hit me. (whacking) (crying out) (sword clangs) (whacking) (crying out) Hey, asshole. (whacks) (cries out) (thuds) - Are you okay? - Yeah, great place. - Yeah we'll have to come back and try the food. Let's go get the girl. - Told you she wasn't gonna talk.

Things are gonna be you know. - Why? Because of your brother? I did some checking. - Yeah so? - [Nicolai] Does he want money from me also? - No. - Well, take down this address. - Uh huh. Go ahead. - 9832 Highland avenue. - Yeah. Yeah I got it. (phone beeps) Asshole. - I'm not convinced sargent White can handle his brother. (suspenseful music) - [Sergei] What about those men following us? - Relax Sergei, first we take Marina home. - But they will know where I live. - Exactly. And when they come sniffing around like dogs I bet I know who will be in charge. (dramatic music) (door bangs) (dramatic music) - [Hal] And he dropped off the woman, 1946 Alder Park. - What's your position? - [Hal] Headed east on Olympic near ah, Century City. - Alright stay on him.

The friggin' Rolls is still here and everything. (bangs) - Great. Now we gotta find the son of a bitch. - Why don't we talk to the woman that was with Rodchenko? - That's a good idea. Get on it, both of ya. - No I can't, it's my anniversary. I'm taking my wife out to dinner. - What? - It's better I go alone anyway. We go in like an army and the woman'll never talk. - Alright. (dramatic music) - [Sergei] I'll bet those cops are still at the car wash. - [Nicolai] Oh what a shame because now we won't surface until our after our business is done.

(phone beeps) - Sergei, it is time to let agent White know what a Russian circle feels like. Hurt him. Hurt him bad. - I know Mr. Rodchenko for approximately five years. Is he in some sort of trouble? - Would you know where I can reach him? - I use a telephone. Nicolai travels a lot, when he's in town I see him. Now if there is nothing else I really must go.
