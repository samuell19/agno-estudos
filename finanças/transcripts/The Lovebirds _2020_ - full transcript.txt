So, last night was fun. -It was really fun. - I had a really good time. Well, good-bye for real. Yeah. -I'm starving. - I could go for some breakfast. Do you wanna go get something to eat? Definitely. -I'll just get my jacket. - Yeah. Mmm. I did. I hung out with the crudites table all night, trying to work up the courage to talk to you because I knew you'd be back. I kept going back to the crudite table, trying to get you to notice me. I noticed you the moment you walked in the door. What's your last name? Why? So you can Google-stalk me? No, I just wanna know what to put in my phone. Oh. I'm not giving you my phone number. You've made a huge mistake. I knew it. I felt it in my gut. -Oh, shit. - What? I forgot that I made plans with my friends today. Yeah, yeah, yeah, go to your friends. It's not a big deal. Unless you want. I could stay. -This was fun. - Oh. -I should go. - Do you wanna stay? Oh... Okay. What is that? -What? - That face. Is that your "I wanna kiss you" face? -No. - Oh. Oh. Wait. Unless... Unless what? What does your "I wanna kiss you" face look like? It looks a lot like this. You are unbelievable. You are literally unbelievable! If I told someone, "This is what Leilani said to me," they'd be like, - "I don't believe you." - Who are you? - You're not even upset! - Why would I be upset? Because it's fucked up. Don't do this. Don't make this a whole global thing... - I'm upset. - I thought you were kidding. Why would I possibly be kidding about something like this? Oh, my God! Okay, he's up now. You think we would win The Amazing Race! - You don't? - You think, in a game show about a race around the fucking world, you and me would come out on top. I did, but now I'm not so sure. We can't even agree on a restaurant. We can't agree on a restaurant because you have a problem with every restaurant in New Orleans. The restaurant capital of the world, and you can't decide. Actually, Hong Kong is the restaurant capital of the world. I just don't want you to embarrass yourself in front of your friends by getting these pretty basic facts wrong. I don't hate restaurants. I like restaurants. You literally spent several hours yesterday writing a negative Yelp review with your white-woman fingers about that tapas place we went to, and I thought it was pretty tasty. It was very salty. I didn't know I would get mouth-fucked by the Dead Sea! And I don't have white-woman fingers. I've got meaty bronze. Why are you being so loud right now? Okay? Do you want the neighbors to think we're crazy? Who cares what the neighbors think? They don't know us. Hi, nice to meet you! We're fighting! No, we're not! We're rehearsing a play! It's a fight scene. How's this? It's fun. It's fun? What do I look like, Chuck E. Cheese? But sexy. You're like Fuck E. Cheese. By the way, you know you can't have your cell phone on those shows, right? You'd lose your mind. No, I wouldn't. I'd be liberated without that thing. - I'm good. - You wanna get that? ♪ Nope, I'm good! ♪ Oh, my God, what if somebody liked something on Instagram? Tsk. Shut up. You don't know me. It's Val. She said I look thicc. Mmm-hmm. Another reason we wouldn't win that show, you can't take selfies when you're half naked, eating ants off a stick. Do you even watch the show? Have I seen The Amazing Race? This is literally the question you're asking me right now? That's what I'm asking you. You're asking me, Jibran, have I seen The Amazing Race? Uh-huh. You've spent this entire time judging this show and you've never seen an episode? I don't need to see something to know I would hate it, okay? I've never been hit by a truck, but I know it would suck! - Wow! - I don't wanna rot my brain watching that reality show garbage. You make documentaries, okay? Those are just reality shows that no one watches. Documentaries are not reality shows. Documentaries are reality. Okay? My work is social activism. I don't do it for the RTs. You don't have to say RTs. Just say retweets, Dad. Can we please go? The later we are, the longer we'll have to stay. What's the rush? It's not like we're doing anything exciting afterward. I thought we were gonna have sex. Oh, yeah, 'cause nothing gets me hotter than a plan in the day to have sex at night. Whoo, freaky! You want freaky sex? We could do freaky sex. Just let me know what you want me to do and I will do it to you at the designated time. That is the antithesis of freaky sex! Okay? Just schedule me in your calendar. "Intercourse with Leilani at 10:42." - Super sexy. - Okay. Freaky sex and scheduling are not mutually exclusive, okay? You think people just randomly show up at the same time for an orgy? No, they probably share a Google Calendar. No, I think it's spontaneous. One guy comes, and another guy comes. They show up and they have sex. It's a bunch of guys there, why wouldn't you have sex with them all? Okay, there's a lot to parse through there, but you're talking about a gang bang, I'm talking about an orgy. Tomato, tomahto. And where are you getting your group sex information? - BuzzFeed? - I don't know! So, who's gonna be at this dinner-party thing? Um, Bobby and Reya. Val... I think maybe Keith, Stefan... - Um... - Oh, you think maybe Keith? Yeah, maybe. As if you're not 100% sure he's gonna be there? I'm not sure. I'm not. Oh, yeah? You wanna bet? I bet he's gonna be there with his fucking lame jokes and his boring IT stories and his... beach muscles he gets from diligent exercise and diet. -Are you done? -Hate to burst the Keith bubble, but all those hilarious jokes that he does? Katt Williams. They're Katt Williams' jokes. You're saying that he steals his jokes from Katt Williams? Exactly. "How do you know it's nice to meet me? I'm an asshole!" That's Katt Williams, word for word. That doesn't even sound like Katt Williams. Well, I'm not gonna use the voice. To win The Amazing Race, you need to be a team, you need to be on the same page. I feel like I'm on one page of the book and you're, like, reading a magazine. Yeah. I would love to be on the same page as you, but you're always locked in your office editing that movie. It's not a movie. This is a documentary about corruption in the educational system. How would I know? You won't even show it to me. -I'll show it to you whenever you want. -Been working on it forever. Okay, great. How about tomorrow? I can't do it tomorrow. I'm rendering the animation. Steph and George are getting married? Did you just like that? Yeah. -What happened to "marriage is bullshit"? -It is. Okay. Well, then why did you like it? Because I didn't wanna be the only one out of our friends to not like it. I'm not a hater. Okay. Since the day we've met, you've talked about how you think marriage is fucking lame. I didn't say "lame." I said "problematic." Right. Two people declaring their eternal love for each other. How problematic. You know what I think? I think you do want all that stuff. Marriage and kids. You just don't want it with me. And I think that you just want someone with no expectations, so you can sit in that room by yourself for the rest of your life. I think you just want a relationship that you can brag about to your friends. Yeah, I do! And I'm not willing to settle. I don't wanna settle, either. That's why I don't wanna be with someone who's so fucking shallow. And I don't wanna be with someone who's so satisfied with being a failure. - I can't do this anymore. - This isn't working. Are we done? I think we've been done for a while. - Oh, fuck! - Shit! - Oh, fuck. Uh... - Shit. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Uh... - Uh, are you okay? - You okay? Oh, there's blood. Here, let me help you up. No, no, you probably shouldn't move him. Oh, right. Yeah. -I'm gonna call 911, okay? - No, no, no! I'm fine. I gotta go. You're bleeding, you're not fine. - Are you sure? - I gotta go. I gotta go! Oh. Uh... I don't know if that's a good idea, man. - Thank you. - I'll call 911. Wait, wait, wait! Wait! You forgot your phone! Oh, my God. - I need your car! - What? I'm a police officer and he's a criminal! Move the fuck over! Get in the back! Move, move, move! Hold on. - Where'd he go? - Huh? Where'd he go? He went that way! East! East! Uh, suspect headed eastbound. What did he do? Was it drugs? It was drugs, huh? Are you undercover? You can't tell us if you're undercover, huh? I get it. At least we didn't hit a good guy, right? It's not good that we hit someone, but at least we hit a bad guy? Yeah, who rides a bike in this part of town? Yeah, where do you think you are, Europe? Sorry, we'll be serious. Right there! There he goes! Off the sidewalk, asshole! Turn, turn, turn! We got him. Yes! Shit! Rats! Right? Wait, if you make a left up here, you can cut him off. Oh, good idea. Oh! - Yep! - Whoo. - There he is, over there! - Oh! Oh! Oh. Fucking jaywalkers. Shit, he's going in circles! What an idiot! - Turn! Turn! - Turn! There, there, there! Go, go, go! He turned the corner! Go down this alley, it's a dead end! Ho, ho, ho! Justice! Oh, my God! Um... Oh, oh... Oh, my God. I don't think he's a cop. Oh, my God. Hello? I think he's fucking dead. Oh, shit! - What the fuck? - Oh, my God. Oh, my God, what did you do? - Oh. Oh, no, no, no. - Oh, oh... No, no, no. This isn't what it looks like. We didn't kill him. You hit him with your car, man. No! I mean, yes, I did, but... - No, that was... That's all. - That was a while ago. Oh, my God, oh, my God. After I hit him, he was alive and, like, great. Not "great." He wasn't having the best day, but he has been breathing since then. He's fucking dead! We know he's dead, but we didn't kill him. He just said he killed him. No. I said I hit him with my car. -Clearly it worked. You killed a guy with your car, man! - Okay, but, no, wait. -We hit him earlier and then we were just drivin' to... - -I was driving, -and we broke up, and I got distracted... - Bobby and Reya's house. ...and I ran through a red light... - But a moustache came in... - But then this guy with a weird moustache... No, we hit him earlier. I helped him a little bit with my map, which I admit was definitely a mistake. He took our car, he ran over him like a dog... We need to call the cops. And then back and forth ten times and now I've got a dead guy's blood on me and my car's a fucking murder weapon! - What are you doing? - I'm calling 911. Please don't do that. We would never hurt anyone. I'd like to report a murder or whatever. We didn't murder anybody! - Yeah, stop. - You stop! Oh, my God, the police aren't gonna believe us. Do you know how stupid we sound? - This is a citizen's arrest. - What is that? It's an arrest from a citizen. Can you do that? - Can he do that? - On the count of three. Okay? On the count of three, what? What is that face? I can't read your face! Just say it. On the count of three. - What? What? - One, two, three, go! The guy just ran for it. Jibran! Okay, the guy's name is Jibran. Run, Leilani! And the girl's name is actually Leilani. Shit. She's... She's running too now. She just happens to be African-American and he just happens to be a person of color as well. But I don't, like, think they're murderers because they're minorities. I think they're murderers because they literally just killed a guy - and he's laying here. - Oh, fuck. Hey. Are you okay? -Nosebleeds. - -It's house painting with red paint. We were painting the kitchen blood colors? What can I get for you guys? Do you have alcohol? - Two, please. - Two. Two what? Two alcohols, please. Thank you so much. We don't serve alcohol. We have to go to the police. Us? You and me? How do you think that's gonna go? It's the best bad idea. No, it's not. They're gonna arrest us in two seconds. Maybe we just tell them the truth. Do you think the police care about the truth? Do you think they're gonna give us the benefit of the doubt? - But what else? - Jibran, the truth sounds crazy. What are you gonna say to them? "Hello, Officer. We are turning ourselves in for now, because we have nothing to hide." "Then why'd you run from the scene of the crime?" "Good question, Officer. That's why you're good at your job. It's because we looked guilty. Which was scary for us, because we are not guilty. So, in a way, us running only proves that we are..." "That's me covering up my bodycam, so I can beat your ass, you fucking liar." - Okay. Okay. Done? - Nope. That was me throwing the book at you. You know there's no real actual book, right? "So you left a man dead in the street?" - "We did not leave him dead." - "And didn't call the police?" "Because there was no time, because we had to..." "Brown man, you sound crazy." -"Don't say that." -"You look like a murderer to me." - "Don't say that." - "Look at your murderous beard and your murderous brow." You said you liked the beard. Your beard looks like murder. - Don't. - Hello? Leilani, where the fuck are you guys? I'm so sorry. We bumped into an old friend. - And... - Still at home. We were going back and forth with him several times. Can you tell them to grab some wine We don't have any white for Evonne. Hey, can you pick up a bottle of pinot? Grigio, not noir. Sure, we'll bring a bottle over. Great. See you in a bit. - What's going on? - They're acting weird. How you know it's nice to meet me? What if I'm an asshole? You're hilarious. This silver milkshake container is such a thing, you know? They're always like, "We made too much, so here's the extra and the container that we made it in." They can't just measure it out? Huh? They don't do that with other stuff. They're not like, "Well, here's spaghetti and here's some more spaghetti on the side. We made too much for the spaghetti plate. Here's soup. We didn't wanna measure it out early on, and here we are." Like, what the fuck? - It's crazy. - It's so crazy. Not the extra milkshake container. Is this Leilani Brooks? Who is this? This is Detective Mary Martin of the New Orleans PD. Hi, Detective. Ma'am, have you driven your vehicle at any time today? No, not-not today. Mmm-mmm. Can I ask where you are right now? She's asking where I am right now. - Hang up. - Home. I'm home. Just chilling. Are you saying that your vehicle is at home as well? - Hang up. - Yes! If I just go to my window right now, I should see... Oh, my God. Honey, wasn't our car parked outside? This is crazy, Detective. I must have left the keys in the ignition. Can I get you two anything else? Is that a waitress? Ma'am, where are you right now? We'll get the check. We're so fucked! No, we're not. We just have to lay low and keep a low profile until this blows over. I don't think... Murders don't blow over, Lei. Yes, they do. If the police find the guy that they're looking for. You and me are the guy they're looking for. You know that song "Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do"? We're the bad boys. What are we gonna do? Yeah, I know that song Who Let the Dogs Out. And I'm always like, who did let the dogs out? Are we just talking about songs that we remember? You started it. Bicycle guy's phone bing-bonged. It just made a bing-bong sound. Oh, don't touch it! That's evidence! I've been touching it the whole time. It's his calendar. "Edie at Dragon's Den." Wait. This Edie person obviously knows Bicycle, right? -What? -So what if she knows who wanted to kill Bicycle? Oh. Okay, so you're suggesting we actually go out there and solve a... Murder? That's what you're suggesting? Kinda. Who the fuck do you think we are? Hobbs and Shaw? We're not even a couple. We couldn't figure out our relationship. You think that we're gonna figure out who killed Bicycle? We did break up, right? Yeah. Okay. Jibran, all we need is a name. We get Mustache's name, we take it to the police, and then we're in the clear. We have ten minutes to get there. I don't think this is a good idea at all. I know you're scared, Ji, and I'm scared, too. But... What a sweet baby. Woof-woof. Can we try Edie? See if she can help us? Okay. But if you're wrong and we spend the rest of our lives on death row, I'm gonna be so pissed at you. That's fair. Oh, my God. It's the police. - Don't answer it, ignore it. - Right, right, right. Right, right. Why do they still have the cigarette lighter? Like, just make it a power outlet at this point, you know? Like, who's like, "I'm operating a vehicle, I want to introduce fire into this..." Jibran, please. No more milkshake monologues, - okay? - Right. Excuse me, sir, this isn't our destination. - Are you Leon? - Yes, sir. Dope. You ordered a Lyft share. I just have it set on that option by default. You're amazing. Oh, you're amazing. But you're like amazing-amazing. No, you are. I miss you when we're together. Like, right this second, I am sitting next to you and I miss you. Aw, baby. So, we're gonna go to this spot and find this Edie person and then see what happens. How are we gonna know who Edie is? I don't know, we just go up to her and ask if... I love you more than I love my mom! Shut the fuck up! Okay? It's all kissy and huggy now, but it all comes crashing down. Okay? All right, here we go into the Dragon's Den. It'll be fine. We got this. It's not that bad. We just gotta find her. Okay. Yeah. We just act super normal, okay? Yeah. We're normal. Just normal people. Coming to a bar. We should not have come here. You say that anytime we go anywhere with people. I was talking about the sense of impending doom that's growing in the pit of my stomach right now! I'm just saying. If I never made plans, we would never go anywhere. Congratulations, you made plans and this happened. Okay, act normal. - Love dancing. - Whoo! Normal-people shit. That has to be her. Okay, what do we do? We should go over there, right? Edie? Edie. Edie? Stop talking. Come with me. Who are you? He sent you? Yeah. Um... Jibran, why don't you explain? Um... There's sort of not a good starting point. He wants to be unprofessional and send two strangers instead of coming himself, that's fine. Let's just do this and be done with it. We just had a question, and we wanted to know if you know a guy with a mustache? We don't know what's going on. Know a guy with a mustache? Okay, drop the act. It's unbecoming. There's a way to do this that's respectable. And this? This is not that. Hand 'em over and this can all end. - What? - Oh, no. The pictures. Give me the envelope. - What pictures? - Oh, no. You guys think you're the only ones who can dig up a little dirt? I know who your boss is. We don't have a boss. We don't work together. We don't know what pictures you're talking about. I'm a documentary filmmaker, she works at an ad agency. You remember that commercial where the guy's a nerd and then he uses this body wash and all the girls, like, wanna fuck him? - That was her idea! - That was my idea. It was based on a true story. This guy was really nerdy at my college, and he would smell good and then I was like, "I like him now." She didn't like the way a guy looked at college, and then he smelled better and then she fucked him! But it's fine, and we don't know anything! Oh, yeah, right. You showed up at the designated time and place of the exchange. Yeah, because of this guy's phone and it bing-bonged your name! We were just trying to go to our friend's dinner party. We have nothing to do with anything. We just answered a bing-bong! - Jibran. Mmm-mmm. - Huh? - She's not buying it. - Oh, okay. Let's take the guesswork out here. You said that this gentleman's not your boss - and you don't even know him? - Uh-huh. Oh. Why don't we just call him and see what he has to say? - Okay. Great. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, call him. Mmm-hmm. Oh, no. It's not what you think. Don't pee down my back and tell me it's raining. - Why would we do that? - We would never do that. If she pees down your back, she's gonna say it's pee. You think you can fuck with a congressman and get away with it? You got another thing coming. - Oh, no! - Oh! What the fuck? Did you just tell them I'm a congressman? - I... - Come here. Real quick. I'll be right back. What's happening? Can you get out? This is fucking insane. Take that damn mask off, Brett. Are you okay? Well, it still doesn't seem like a good idea. My husband. He was just about to get me my pan. Right, hon? I thought we agreed we weren't really gonna do the pan. You go get me my goddamn pan! Hey, just to clarify, we're not blackmailing anybody. Excuse me, what is "the pan"? You tried to fuck us. Now you're gonna get fucked. Yeah, okay, your premise is wrong because we didn't try to fuck you. And we don't wanna get fucked. - No. - Mmm. I just love the smell of sizzling bacon, don't you? The only problem is the grease! Y'all ever see a bad grease burn? It is remarkable the damage a little hot oil can do. I'm gonna give you both a choice, okay? All the grease in this pan, or what's behind this door. - What? - I said, bacon grease or door. It's up to you. And you're first, Mr. Bing-Bong. Take the grease. Are you serious? It's boiling hot grease. And she could pour the grease on my face! Edie, may I ask a question? Do I get to know prior to making my decision where you'll be pouring the grease? Um, yeah, it'll probably most definitely be your face. Thank you. She said probably my face. She's obviously trying to scare you into choosing something worse. We're single now. I have to go out into the dating world. How do you think I'm gonna do on Bumble? Scars are super sexy. Oh, you like burn scars? After this, I'm gonna seek out a guy with a burnt face. You promise? I'm gonna stalk your Facebook so hard. And if you're not with a fucking burn victim, I'm gonna be so very upset. Well, thanks for reminding me to block you. I'm blocking you right after this. Let's make a decision here, all right? My husband and I have plans tonight. I'll go with not the grease. I'll go with the door. - Jibran! - Door it is. Tell him what they've won. No, no, no, no! Jibran, press your feet! I am! I'm planting my feet! Stop it! Leave him alone! - Open the door. - Yep. Is it gonna shit on me? Take the grease. It's your turn, little missy. The grease! The grease! I take the grease! A lady who knows what she wants. Ow! No, no, no! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! Okay, let's see... Come on, help, help, help me, help! Oh, God. Honey, are you all right? No! Stay back! Stay back! You stay back! - You ready? - Yeah. One, two, three... Where are you going? Whoa, honey! What the fuck just happened? Dude, I said, "One, two, three," and you, like, ran. Yeah, 'cause that's what you did in the alley. You kinda set a precedent. That's what I was going off of. Yeah, but I assumed you assumed this time it would be like, "One, two, three, attack." Why would I assume that? Because we had weapons? I don't know. I never want to see a horse again in my life. Thank you. What, I look stupid? Kinda like unicorn throw-up? No, you look... the opposite. Unstupid. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It just hurts a lot right where the horse kicked me. Uh... Come with me. It looks okay? Ow. - If you could... - Sorry. Stop tapping right where the wound is. I'm just trying to help. Okay. Come on, let's do this. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I can't. I'm just gonna wear this shirt for the rest of my life. No, you're not. Stand up. Uh, raise your arms. Okay. One, two, three. Can I just say this is the most batshit crazy night ever? You've never been framed for murder and tortured with bacon grease? Really? - It just... - Really? - Just be so gentle. Just... - Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't even touch you. I ordered us a Lyft. I hope you changed your settings. You probably don't remember this, but, our first date, that restaurant, there was this couple sitting next to us, and they didn't talk the whole... I remember them. - You do? - Yeah. They didn't say anything to each other the entire time. You know, I think about them all the time. 'Cause I was looking at them like I never want to be that couple, you know, that runs out of stuff to talk about. But then the more I think about them, the more I'm like... maybe they weren't miserable. You know? Maybe they were just comfortable with each other. So my theory about Edie obviously didn't pan out. Maybe you were right. Maybe we should just go to the cops. I found something. What? The piece of paper that Edie had with Bicycle's number? It has an address on it, too. What? When did you get this? I was thinking, maybe Mustache killed Bicycle because of those pictures that Edie was talking about. So if we can find those pictures, figure out what they are, maybe we can exonerate ourselves. Mustache was clearly looking for something, and Edie was very upset about those pictures. - It's a clue, right? - Yeah! I did a clue. Should we go to that address? You know this is actually illegal, right? Breaking into Bicycle's house? Are you sure? Are you? Yeah. Oh, that's our guy. Oh, shit. Shit. He knows it's us, he totally knows it's us. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Shit, he's totally onto us. He's onto us, he's onto us. Oh, he's just a regular racist. - Thank God. - Let's go. Shit. -What? - How are we gonna get up there? What? You just... Did you think it was one of those "Men Only" doors? Sorry. Maybe... Maybe there's one of those, like, catwalk things around the side... A "catwalk"? You mean like for fashion shows? Do you mean a fire escape? Why are you making jokes right now? This is serious. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Break the glass. You go. - Me go? I'm wearing heels. - You're wearing heels. Right. The icepick part will stab the glass... The "icepick part"? Do you mean the heel? Yes, the pointy heel part of the shoe will break the glass. It'll go right through it. No, no. Use your shoulders. Break the glass. I just got kicked by a horse. Can I take five minutes off from, like, bashing myself? - Okay, I'm sorry. - Okay. I'm just concerned the heel's just gonna snap off. No. Not if you do it exactly perpendicular, 'cause it's a small surface area. Pressure is... Okay. How do you know that? MythBusters. So you do like reality shows. Eh, it's more of a docuseries. - Ow! Oops. - Oh! Ow! I remember now. That myth got busted. ...reportedly ran over the cyclist multiple times. Two witnesses at the scene are currently being treated for emotional distress. I think this is it. What if there's someone in there? Looks empty. Right, 'cause it's probably empty 'cause it's Bicycle's apartment and he's... - Yeah. - Dead. Yeah, I was there, Jibran. - Just try the window. - Okay. It's locked. Okay, your turn to kick it. My shoes aren't made for kicking. Yeah, neither were mine. In my defense, the heel on the kicking shoe didn't break off, it was the heel on the standing... Jibran, I will throw you down this catwalk. I shouldn't have said that. Sorry you broke your shoes. Thank you, they were my date shoes. I didn't know you had date shoes. I got 'em for you. Can you kick this in quietly, please, since I'm barefoot? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, here we go, here we go. What? What are you doing? Are you knocking? No! I just wanna pull back so I don't cut up my hand. I make my living with these hands. Shit. Help me, help me, help me. Ow. - You okay? - Yes, I'm okay. Okay. - Wait, you hear that? - Hear what? That. There's, like, music happening. - We should go in there. - What? No. What else are we gonna do? Go back outside? Okay, okay, okay. We're just gonna take a peek. What is... No, dude. Shut the fuck up, okay? I remember this shit plain as day. You were the one that was fucking passed out. Because I... No. No, it was me, it was Boyd Ashley. Ashley. And I ate that day 'cause I was in a bulking phase. Who are all these frat dudes? It's like a roofie laboratory in there. Those must be the photos that Edie was talking about. He left one of the envelopes right there. - We gotta go get it. - Don't do it! All those fuckboys are in there. I don't exactly know what that means. - Did I use it right? - No, you didn't. - What are fuckboys? - I'm not having this conversation right now with you. Okay... No, no, no. No, it's fine, they can't hear us. The music's too loud. Watch. We need to go in there, grab one o' those envelopes, and we figure out what the fuck is goin' on. But all the Abercrombie & Fitch people will see us. Okay, okay, okay, we gotta, um... We gotta come up with a plan to distract them, pull them out of there. I got it! You stay here. I'll gonna go out, ring the doorbell. I'm gonna say, "Pizza delivery." Oh, hey, wassup? Hey, man, it's been a minute. Who the fuck are you? - It's her and me! - Me and him! Yes! From, uh... Oh, no. Get him, Jibran! Fuck him up, Jibran! - Fuck him up! Fuck him up! - I'm trying! Stop saying that! Tell me when you want me to jump in. You want me to jump in? This isn't Ultimate Fighting, Jibran. You can't tap out. I got you! - You're hitting me! - You're in the way. Move! Hey, help! Take that! Oh. Fuck! Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are we? We're the people who want some answers, bitch! The bigger question is, who the fuck are you? What are you doing in my fucking room? Um... We're here... Ow! Why would you do that? Yeah... Why would we do that? That's what you wanna know. We're asking the questions. And the answers to our questions better be answers. But the answers to your questions are gonna be my fists. What? - Ow! - First of all, motherfucker, - who do you work for? - Yeah, motherfucker! I don't know what you're talking about. Don't pee down my back and tell me it's raining. - Don't do it. Don't do it. - We don't like it. - Nope. - 'Cause we know you're lying, and then we have piss on our backs. I would never do that. So tell us what we wanna know. Yeah. Do you know Bicycle? Do I know Bicycle? What does that mean? - Bicycle! Two wheels? - Handlebars? - Sometimes there's a basket. - And sometimes there's spokes. Yeah, ET rode one and flew in it, bitch! I know what a bicycle is. Do you mean Tom? I don't know. Do we look like a bitch? Fine. I work for Tom. Uh, Tom rides a bicycle. He's like a weird environmentalist. Is environmentalism weird or is it absolutely necessary? I recycle everything! Yeah. Sometimes she'll try and recycle eggshells and banana peels, and I'll be like, "That's more compost." Okay, focus back on me, little Brett Kavanaugh. What do you do for Tom? Uh... Uh... I'm not supposed to say. Shut the fuck up and talk, Chug-A-Lug Chuck! How am I supposed to shut the fuck up and talk at the same time? That's impossible! - Figure that shit out! - Figure it out. Please, all we do is, we stuff these envelopes. Okay? And then we have to deliver them - to these, like, rich people. - What rich people? I don't... I don't know, okay? Uh, he works at this, like, uh, club. And these people are... These people are dangerous, okay? You don't want to fuck with these people, okay? Ow! I have been 100% cooperating! I don't like your tone, Date Rape McGee. So tell us where the fuck this club is. I don't know. Because they don't tell us. They said the less that we know, the better, okay? They only contact him on his phone. Oh, fuck, Jesus! Please help, help, please! Intruders, intruders! Help! - Oh! - Hi, Steve. Please, don't... We gotta get out of here. Come on, this way. Shit. Hello? Yeah. I took care of the problem. Yeah, he's quod mortem. Mmm-hmm. I understand. Yeah. Yeah, I'll make sure it goes smoothly tonight. You have nothing to worry about, okay? Hang on a second. Go, go, go, go, go. I can hear you better now. Go ahead. I just saw two people get murdered. Until yesterday, I had seen zero people get murdered. That could've easily been us. Oh, my God, there's blood on my knuckles. I left my DNA at the crime scene. Shit, I left my fingerprints on Date Rape's face. And now I feel really bad for calling him Date Rape. The police are gonna think we killed him, too. They're gonna think we're, like, serial killers. We gotta figure this shit out. Open it. Open it. What is this? What is this? "Dear Mrs. Burrows, There are many. We know you are one." What else? What else? That-That's it. This is like The Amazing Race, but with dead people. Wait. We have to get into Bicycle's phone. He said this is how they contact him. I'm gonna start guessing passwords. Important dates. 1-4-9-2. Nope. - 1-7-7-6. Nope. - Ugh. What, are you gonna guess every impressive date in history? Stop. Right. He was a bicycle fan. What was the year that Lance Armstrong won his first Tour de France? - 1-9... - Stop, stop, stop. Okay? You're gonna lock us out of the phone and then we're literally gonna have nothing else. Okay. I know who can get us into the phone. - Who? - Keith. - Keith? - He's our IT guy, okay? -Oh, really? -And he's a genius at this type of stuff. Oh, he's a genius? Wow! You guys are so lucky to have a genius working at your office as the IT guy. I'm not trying to hype him up. But if anybody can do it, he can do it. Errol Morris is a genius. JK Rowling is a genius. You could even say Lil Wayne is a genius. But Keith? Fucking Keith? What is your deal with him? Why are you so... I don't like the way he looks at you. He doesn't look at me like anything. Well, then... I don't like the way you look at him. Look, do you wanna get into this phone or not? 'Cause this could be our only chance. All right. We're gonna go in for five minutes, get the phone unlocked, and we are leaving. No, wait. We can't just go in there and ask Keith to hack into a random phone. 'Cause he's really ethical about this kind of stuff. Oh, he's really ethical, but he's okay stealing comedy? This guy's a real question mark. Help me come up with something believable. Everyone! Look who finally showed up. About fucking time! Hey. Sorry we're so late. - Oh, hey, Keith is here. - Hi. Oh, my God, this all looks so good. Oh, Reya, you have outdone yourself! Oh, my God! Did you try this, guys? Oh, my God, that is to die for! These are some of the best... Things we've had. Whoa, it's so fresh! So these are red, there's green ones. What other pepper colors do you got? There's also yellow. I wasn't asking you, Keith. I was asking Reya. Are you guys okay? - Us? - So good. - We're fucking great. - A-OK. One hundred. And what the fuck are you wearing? What the fuck am I wearing? What the fuck are you wearing, dude? Turtleneck. Is that blood on your face? And it's a big disgrace. We actually do have some news. Um... - Jibran, tell them. - We box now. Boxing? We actually just took a class before we came here. And Jibran boxed outside of his weight class. It was incredible. I'm what they call a "bleeder" in the boxing biz. They actually said I could never be a professional boxer because of how much I bleed. So the reason you were late was because you were boxing? Yeah! Uh... Oh, my God, I have such a good idea! Do you guys wanna see a video of Jibran getting knocked out? Yeah, definitely. Pull out your phone, honey. Okay. What? I can't remember my passcode to my phone. Oh, my God! Do you think that it's all of the hits that you took to your head while boxing? Is it a new passcode? No, Keith, it's not a new passcode! Good question, though. Oh, my God! Do I have a brain... brain... brain injury? Call your doctor. Yeah, I'll call Doctor... You don't remember his name! His name is in the phone, but I can't get into the phone, - so I can't even google it! - How do... If only we could unlock the phone. Oh, no... - It's okay. - Huh? I can get into your phone. Oh, you don't have to do that. - I wanna help. - Okay, let's do it right now! This thing's a wreck. You need a new phone, man. You need a new phone. - What? - What? - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Okay. I'm just running the rainbow tables here, about halfway through. I was actually gonna run a brute-force algorithm, but this'll be a lot faster. It'll be faster, yeah. Good call. Oh, you know about it? - Yeah, know all about it. - Awesome. 'Cause a brute-force algorithm would brutally force the rhythm of Al Gore, uh, while rainbow tables are sort of more the spectrum of Roy G. Biv and all that, so... Roy G. Biv? Roy Greg Biv. Discovered rainbows. And now he takes up boxing. Reya... Jibran and I broke up. Oh, my God, are you serious? How is that even possible? You're like the best couple ever. Us? You and Bobby are the perfect couple. Are you kidding? Oh, no, Bobby and I fight all the time. Yeah, but you guys have sex constantly. Like doing all kinds of freaky shit. Oh, no. Why would you think that? 'Cause you post those hot pictures - of you and Bobby in bed. - Oh. Two of my exes follow me. I'm just trying to make them jealous. Yeah, it's not... So where'd you learn this stuff? Like, MIT or something? Me? Yeah, right. Nothing like that. You're the fancy one here. What? Yeah, Leilani's told me all about you. Sound like a very impressive guy. - She talks about me? - Yeah. She brags about you all the time. Look at that. We're in. - Can you do me a favor? - Yeah, anything. Ever since Ji and I broke up, I've been super emotional, and I have all these dick pics, and I just need someone to hold onto them for me till I'm emotionally ready. - You printed them out? - I did. Just put them... Don't open 'em. Just put them in a safe place, okay? "Senator Burrow"? Mmm-hmm, that's what I call it. 'Cause he be burrowing all up in there! Okay. And you said I get freaky and shit. Hey! Um... - So Keith unlocked my phone. - Great! Yeah, my doctor's at a party. He'll see me, but we have to go right now. Okay, let's go. We cannot go dressed like this, though. Why not? Oh, he's at a fancy benefit, so... Can we borrow some nice clothes from you, Rey? Yeah. Right this way. Oh. Yeah. What are you doing? Turning around so you can change. It's not like you haven't seen this a million times. Okay. - Actually, turn around, yeah. - A little weird. Are you ready for this? No. But I'm glad we're together. Me, too. Listen. If I don't make it, you could do a lot worse than Keith. I would never date anyone who steals comedy. You know, I'mma finish getting dressed outside so you can get dressed in here. Okay. - Shoes. - Guess I don't need these. - Yeah. Trade you. - Thanks. See you later, crocodile. Okay. You look great. Thank you. - Ready? - Yeah, ready. For our doctor's! Yeah, my doctor's, with the... - Yeah. - Have a great night! Four concussions. Oh, no. It's the cops again. Ma'am, it's a little quiet in here. Do you mind turning on some music or something? - Yeah. Of course. - Thank you. - What? - This used to be our jam. This has never once been our jam. Do not act like you don't like this song like the rest of the world.

Hi, can we, um... Sorry. - Sorry. Thank you. - Excuse me. - Hi. - Oh, it's so sharp. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. We are one. We are Sacrarium. We are many. We are Sacrarium. - We are many. - We are one. We are Sacrarium. We are one... Welcome, Membra Autem Sacrarium. From the time of Hermes Trismegistus, Hermes the Thrice-Blessed... This is some Illuminati bullshit. To build the pyramids to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Light the fire of knowledge. L'Eggo my Eggo. Where's the beef? This unbroken chain of wisdom shall be handed down to ten initiates. The few become many become one. Fifty-one. Is this Bingo? I like Bingo. Seventeen. Six. Twenty-three. Did they win? Fourteen. I don't think we're supposed to do that. Seventy-two. Forty-four. Where are they going? Thirty-four. Do we want our names to be called? I don't know. I don't think so. And the final number is... Ninety-nine. Let the ceremony begin. - Oh, no, that's not the vibe. - Mmm-hmm. What is happening? I think they're gonna, um... Yeah, that's what I thought was gonna happen. No, they didn't. - Uh, yes, they did. - Yes, they did. You know, I'm actually not hating this. Yeah, you've made your, um, thoughts on orgies quite clear. Do you think they're gonna call more numbers? - This is spontaneous. - This is not spontaneous! I bet all these people had it on their Google Cal. Stop! Go away! I love that they actually respect the word "stop." There is a traitor amongst us. A worker has violated the most sacred code of Sacrarium. And for this, he has paid a hefty price. He is quod mortem. Jibran, my God. They hired Mustache to kill Bicycle. Oh, shit. Silence! We should get out of here. I have just learned that this man's barcode has been used to enter Sacrarium tonight. It's okay. We have imposters in our ranks. Oh, no, imposters. That sucks. We must all reveal our true faces, so that this imposter may be rooted out and dealt with. On my count of three, unmask yourselves. One... - Okay, okay, fuck, fuck. - Are we gonna do it? Everyone's gonna take their mask off. Two... Fuck, fuck, we have to do it. If everybody else is doing it. Three! Oh, fuck. A true member knows, you never take off your mask. Oh, my God, that's them. Go! Go get 'em! - Oh, God. - We are one. We are Sacrarium. Your burnt offerings shall be made to the gods, - and it shall replenish them. - Oh! No! Stop! I'm a bleeder! Evacuate. Evacuate. Evacuate. What the fuck? What the fuck? All the fuck people left. Are we having the same dream? - Um... - Let's go. - Police! - Go, go, go, go! - Oh, my God. - Go, go, go, go! - Freeze! Hands in the air! - Whoa. Whoa. Higher! - Higher! - This is as high as they go. Dispatch, that's a 10-95. They're in custody. We're on our way back. Detective Martin will be here shortly. It's over. We're done. I know. I need to tell you something. Yeah? You remember when you went out of town for Ben's bachelor party? You ate all the peanut brittle. No. Yeah. I snuck into your office and I watched your documentary. - You did what? - I know, I'm sorry. But can I just say that it was really good. Why didn't you say something? Jibran, honestly, sometimes... I feel like you don't care what I think. I care so much about what you think. That's why I didn't wanna show it to you. I was afraid you wouldn't like it. You know, you've had your life figured out since the moment we met. I always felt like you could do so much better than me. You know, honestly, I... I feel like I don't have anything figured out. Like, zero. But I was so obsessed with what everybody else thought, except the one person that I care about the most. I just want you to be happy. I want you to be happy, too. We'll still be friends, laying out at the trial. Oh, no, I took a deal. - What? - Nobody told you? Wait, but I thought we'd have the same lawyer. I'm a rat all day. - It's done? - Yeah, it's done. Ah, shit. I like them. I don't think they should break up. Relationships are a motherfucker. Yeah. We've been looking for you all over this city. You guys are key witnesses on a homicide, and the suspect is still on the loose. What? We've been trying to track you down all night to make sure you were safe. We tried calling your phone several times. Wait, I'm sorry. You don't think we're the murderers? No. There were traffic cameras that caught the entire pursuit. - Uh-huh. - I can't believe this. We're trying to ID the individual who carjacked your vehicle. We know that he's responsible for this incident as well as multiple homicides at the St. Charles Apartments. - A bunch of dead frat guys. - Uh... Okay... Just to be clear, we are not suspects in a murder/homicide. - You know we didn't do this. - We didn't do it. - And you know it. - Of course you didn't do it. Why would two civilians violently murder a man they've never even met? Like, why would we... - It doesn't make sense. - It doesn't make any sense. Oh, my God! That's right. I promise I have never killed anyone. And I promise to never kill anyone, Scout's honor. - Never. Never kill anybody. - Never kill. Have I thought about killing people? Like Jibran? All the time. But I would never... - But that's in a normal way! - No... She would never act on it. In the way where I'm like, "I will kill you, I will wring your neck!" But not in the real murder way. Not physically. I have rolled through stop signs almost every day of my life, but not in a dangerous way. I used to sell, uh, my uncle's edibles. He was always like, "It's legal in Amsterdam." He could not point to Amsterdam on a map, but... She did not sell them in Amsterdam. She did sell them here. But to help people get high. Just glaucoma and things like that. Yes, mostly. She did make some money at a time when we did need some money. We needed to pay some bills. Wait, I'm sorry. So, did you guys catch the... the cult people? The cult in the theater with the people with the masks and everybody was... sex. The lucky people had sex. They would go on the round bed... There was music. - Yeah, they were having sex. - In a very public place. Some people were putting in work. There was a big round bed. Some people got right to it. They were... I will agree they were putting in work. Yeah, we saw all of that. And let me tell you, sis, it was a sight. That's super helpful, but we know all about Sacrarium. We've been tracking them for months, and the raid tonight was supposed to shut them down for good, but somebody tipped them off that we were coming. Look, you guys witnessed some horrific things. Eventually, we're gonna need your statements, but I really think that you two would benefit from some sleep. So why don't you come back first thing in the morning and we'll get your statements then. One of our guys out back will take you home. And we'll keep an eye on your place to make sure you're safe until the suspect is apprehended. Thank you so much. This has been a good experience. - I hope so. - Thank you for everything. Is there a comment card? 'Cause I'm doing five. Fives down the line. Yeah, I would love to just... Okay? So, that's it? We just go back to our normal lives? Like nothing happened? I guess so. Um... I could sleep on the couch tonight. Oh, no, no, no. We can... We can trade off. No, you should have the bed. This is crazy. I know we didn't, like, solve the crime or whatever, but we got really close. I'm proud of us. Hey, not bad for a couple rookies. You know, the one thing I can't figure out is, who called the cops? I did. Remember me? How did you get in this car? I told you I was a cop. I've been on the force for about 13 years. I'm actually kind of a big deal over there. And you're a member of the sex cult, too? Nah, they pay me to keep 'em safe from the police. Wait, so you were protecting the sex cult and also blackmailing its members? As a matter of fact, I was. Do you know how much this fucking city pays me? I put my life on the line every single day and the government tosses pennies at me. But you know what is fucked up? That guy on the bicycle? The one I ran over several times with your car? - I remember. You remember? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we remember. That was my friend. Me and him, we come up with the blackmail-the-cult scheme. But he got too greedy. Stopped giving me my full cut. And then, against my better judgment, he brought those ignorant frat boys onboard. Sir, if I may, we don't know anything, and we have terrible memories. So please just let us go, you can trust us. Lady, I don't trust anyone. Here's a little tip: The world is out to get you. The only one who's got your back is you. - You're wrong. - That's not true. I trusted someone. One person. Siobhan. I will never trust anyone again. Never. You come into this world alone and you leave this world alone. Which is what you two are about to find out. Look, I'm sorry I have to kill you guys. You seem like a nice, though somewhat annoying couple. But if it makes you feel any better, I will get over it. You don't have to do this, okay? You're not a killer, you're a good person. - I can see it in your eyes. - Your eyes are so kind. They're luminous. Do you know how many people I have killed today? Uh... I would say you've killed, like, exactly the right number of people. I wouldn't add to it, 'cause right now, the number of people you've killed is impressive, but not, like, worrying. Also, you killed a guy on a bicycle and a bunch of frat boys. Who's kidding who? You're practically a folk hero. That was a rhetorical question. Never too late to change. Maybe if you do, you can find a new Siobhan. Did I say that you could talk about Siobhan? I thought you were sharing and thought it was an open invitation, but I wasn't... Listen, Siobhan is clearly a tramp. You, too! Take her name out of your mouth! I will never say the name Siobhaaa again. She's dead to me. I don't even... She sucks. Shut up. He clearly isn't over Siobhan. Turn around. Put your hands behind your back. You lay a hand on her and I'll kick your ass, dude. - Turn around. - Yes, sir. They have traffic cam footage of you, man. You're so fucked. Nah, I saw it. It's very grainy. It's like, uh, Bigfoot footage. Jibran, we can't just sit here waiting to be killed, okay? - We need to do something. - Okay. - Help me figure something out. - Okay, okay. Um... Here, uh, loosen my ties. - Can you do it? - I can barely reach it. Okay, it's just getting tighter. Ow. I'm sorry. Okay, try me. - Is it working? - No. Oh, fuck! I'm gonna try kicking this. Oh, shit. I wish I was wearing your date shoes. Jibran, the lighter! The cigarette lighter! That's what's it there for! Go, go. Yeah, you can do it. Okay, that's kind of hot. Does he see us? My God, he's laying down plastic. Oh, shit, shit. - Has it popped out yet? - No. - What about now? - Okay. Okay. Come on. Hurry up. Get it, get it, get it. Get it, get it, get it. - Close your eyes. - Come on, come on. Get the plastic, not my hands! Drop it, drop it. Ow! Ahh! - I had it in my mouth, okay? - Yeah, but you didn't have - the hot end in your mouth. - Hurry up! Hold, up, hold up, he's looking at us. He's looking at us. Hold on. Okay, put it back. Put it back. Put it back. Out of the car. They're gonna get you. They know you drove us. No, they're not gonna suspect me. When I drove you guys to your apartment, the real killer jumped out of the bushes and hit me over the head! When I woke up, there I was, tied up in the back of my own squad car with you guys here at the marina. Watch your step. And then the killer made us get on the boat. That's right. All three of us. And you remember what happened next. He made us all kneel down. Go ahead. I jumped up and tried to save you guys. And in the scuffle, I was shot. I wasn't mortally wounded, but I had to watch in horror as the masked killer executed you both with my gun. Anyway, let's get this over with. Eenie... No. Eenie, meenie, miney... Hey, Mustache. Okay, okay. Oh, fuck. - Oh, no, no, no. - Oh, shit. Go ahead. Shoot me. Right here in the shoulder would be good. That way I don't have to shoot myself. Drop the gun or I'll break his neck. You can't break his neck. It-It-It's too thick. I'll just twist until something bad happens. From where I'm sitting, he's super convincing. He can't hurt you. I bet he can do it quite easily. - Drop it. - Leilani, listen to him. Put the gun down. You don't have a shot. - Just put it down. - I do have a shot. Why are you arguing with me about this? Because you think you're always right, and you're wrong about this, okay? I'm supposed to listen to someone who's never held a gun before, and I'm the know-it-all? - You refuse to take risks! - Guys... This is a prime example. - You're the reason we're here! - Guys... - This is your fault! - Guys! Do you really wanna do this right now? Oh, my God. I wanted to go to the police! You were driving the car! I got kicked by a horse for you! - Oh, my God. - You just ran from - a dead body and left me. - You guys are so annoying. I am alone in this relationship. You watched my movie without asking me! Nobody cares about your shit. Stop! You sound like my parents! Understand what I'm doing for once! Be with me on something! - One, two, three! - Go! shit. - Jibran, are you okay? - Yeah. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Thanks to you guys, we have the suspect in custody. You're safe now. Sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Are you? Yeah. You know, I knew you were gonna do that "one, two, three" thing, even though it didn't work any other time. - You did everything. - No, it was equal. - You did. - It was equal! - You shot him! - I know. Don't... - That was amazing. - I would rather forget that. Don't ever shoot anyone ever again. I will never shoot anyone ever again. - What? - I didn't say anything. I know that face. What face? It's the "I wanna kiss you" face. - No, no. No, I don't... - Yes, it is. - I don't wanna kiss you. - Oh. I don't, so... You're very arrogant. Gross. Oh, gross? Wow, you wanna kiss me so bad, like, with tongue and everything. I can tell. You are projecting. - Oh, okay. - I think you wanna kiss me. - I wanna kiss you? - You wanna kiss me. And you're, like, doing this now. Doing what? What am I doing? Sorry to interrupt, lovebirds. I gotta take you to the hospital, have them check you out. It's protocol. Back-of-the-ambulance sex is pretty freaky, right? - I am so down. - All right, let's go. Are you gonna try that move we saw in the orgy? Oh, I'm gonna put in some work! Mmm-mmm, you don't sound right. That's my line. -Run, Leilani! - Jibran, I'm running. Holy shit, holy shit! They're right behind us! Let me lead. Let me get in front, slow down! - Run, run, run! - Jibran, I'm running. Don't tell me to run when I'm already running! Oh, my God, they're right there! We're so fucked! This is London, England. Jibran and Leilani lost valuable time after a heated argument about the metric system. With only two legs remaining, do they have what it takes to win the $1 million prize? We're actually doing it, Jibran! I told you we could win The Amazing Race. Okay. "For over 50 years, enthusiasts have gathered at Hyde Park to commemorate..." - Uh-oh. - What? Oh,.
