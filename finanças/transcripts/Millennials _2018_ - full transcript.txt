I called you because I love you. And to tell you I miss you. -Stop it, stop it! -You're free now. For the sale of "Eat at Home." For two million. Dollars. -Did you screw me over? -A little bit, yes. Facu, it's me. Can I go to your house? Hey, don't fight, please. Yes? Come on. Come on, yes, show me. Come on, come over here. -Come over here. -Stop this, stop! Why? -It's done. -Why? What happened? -Wait, wait, we're fine. -No. -It's fine, we're not fighting. -Yes. We're calm. -It's alright. -No, nothing is right, nothing! What did you do? Me? What did you do? -Hey! -Hey! I'm glad you're back. -Yes, ready to start screwing up again. -I'll put up a mattress for you. -Thanks. -I have some tuna-- -I already ate. -I'll get a pizza. No, really, I already ate. My old man came to get me earlier. We went to celebrate when I got out. -Why didn't you go to his place? -Well, I went to... It doesn't matter. -Is everything OK with him? -With my dad? Yes, he's still my idol. The only thing I wonder is where he got the money for my bail. But you know. -I have no idea. -I don't know either. Facu, come on. Tell me. You're getting me into trouble again. -Tell me. -A few days ago, I saw him talking with Álvarez. No. Come on, he's an idiot! He's never going to learn! -He'll never learn! -He did it for you, you're his son. -You're free now, be grateful. -Yes, but this freedom wasn't free. -What happened? -You haven't heard? -About what? -The app. We had a third wheel. Yes, obviously. -You shouldn't have been here. -Me? No, it was you. -You're the third wheel here. -A third wheel? This is what I'm good at, -you don't know how to use your hands. -Me? -You screwed up. -You did. -No, you screwed up. -Me, screw up? You both screwed up, boys. Now that I know that it won't happen, I'm not horny anymore. You know what? You're right. Let's forget about what happened. Let's order food. Why don't we go out instead? Just the two of us? This is not a competition. No, I was asking sincerely. From the heart. I was being sincere too. The three of us should go out. -I wasn't asking you to leave. -Really? -I wanted you to stay. -Oh, so you two are best friends now? I thought you two were adults, but you're not. This is over. Please, leave now. Yes, this is awesome. -You couldn't get this in jail? -No. -Really? -Not at all. No, their weed is awful. They have a drink that feels so rough when you sip, that it scratches your throat. This is what you miss the most in jail. The pleasures in life. Now that you mention it, what's going on with the showers? What if you drop the soap? In the showers? Nothing. I'd rather not talk about it. No, I really want to know. Please, tell me, with details. First of all, I'm not telling you. Second, nothing happened. -You sure? -Yes. Yes? I'll take a look in here, then. Did you know? During military service, gays would go through the medical exam. They'd fail it, obviously, for being gay. But in their paperwork, they'd write D.A. Do you know what that stands for? -Dilated anus. Yes, I swear. -Sure. -Dilated anus? In their paperwork? -Yes, I swear, dilated anus. They say it's a myth, but I don't know. -What a challenge it must be then. -That's what they said. -It's an old belief. -Weird. Answer it. -No, it must be-- -Answer. I have the answering machine for that. Hi, Facundo, it's me. I've been looking for you for days. I know you've been avoiding me, but we need to talk, it's about something important. I can't believe those two idiots acted that way. -Whatever, they're acting like kids. -Yes. But you know what? Their loss. I mean, look at you. What? It's my loss. This is the second time I'm in a bad threesome. The second time. I give up. It's obviously not for me. No, honey, look, if your dream is to have a threesome, to be with three or four men, you need to do it. -I mean it, is that your sexual fantasy? -Yes. Then you should do it. Even if it's six men. Do it. You're really good at giving pep talks. -You're like a midnight preacher. -Stop it, girls, please. Stop fucking around like that. -Like what? -I mean it. Respect other people's beliefs. -Are you serious? -Yes, I am. -She's serious. -I see. Yes, obviously. Some experiences can't be explained to others. If you don't live them, you'll never understand them. -Of course. -Shut up then. OK. Speaking of experiences that can't be explained, You're getting on my last nerve. Quit it. Fine. Back to the main subject. Those two guys, -the two guys here. -Yes? It seems like destiny keeps bringing them together. I think those two should marry each other. -Then they'll stop bothering you. -Please, stop it. Don't even talk about it. Hush! Shut up already. Stop it. Why are you frowning? Anyone that saw you would think you just got sentenced. I'm still a prisoner of my failure. You're so pessimistic. Look. I know that Juanma and Rodri did screw you over. -But please, stop it with the drama. -I can't believe it, I was conned by two amateurs. I can't forgive myself. Things happen for a reason. Yes, a good reason for them. But I don't have a company, -I have nothing. -You have yourself, the best resource. That's not much of a consolation. You're going to have to focus on that, because your career as a successful influencer starts today. -Oh, you're serious? -Of course! Do I ever kid? Fine, but never in here. Let's go to the office, I have a couple of surprises that you're going to love. -The offer is in. -How long do we have to wait? -No idea. -OK, fine. But you let them know that we want to close, right? Stop it already, partner, don't be so anxious. We don't want them to know we're eager to sell. -How are the rich boys doing? -Hi. -Good? -What a surprise. Why? I said I was coming. -Yes, but we never agreed on a time. -I don't work on schedules. I work on my own time, not schedules. -That's a good philosophy in life. -Very zen. -Yes, zen. -Good. Can I go look at CoWorking? Okay, I'm going. -Did he just ask himself? -Yes. -And then he answered himself? -He answered himself. -Look what I prepared for you. -Are you trying to cheer me up? That's not necessary. I just brought some gifts. -From our main sponsors. -Main sponsors? Yes. We have two for now. One's an electronics store, the other one is a well-known soda brand. -International? -National, of course, and not the best. But they pay well. That's good. What do I have to do? Be yourself. Be yourself, make videos, and upload them to social media. Great, I'll think about it and talk to you tomorrow. No, there's no thinking about it. You have to do it now. This is for now. Are we clear? But I left jail less than 24 hours ago, my life is a mess. Leave the past in the past. Your focus should be now and the future, Stop it with your motivational speech. Fine, then I'll talk as a businessman. This new world, the influencer world, it's very competitive. You lose millions if you miss a day. And you can go from glory to failure in a heartbeat. -Are we clear? -That bad? Yes, of course. Look! How nice! -Good! We're almost done. -Good! Very good. -Are you drinking water? -We don't have water, so no. -You're leaving me alone? -Oh, sweetie. -Of course you are. -Have faith, friend, it'll be alright. Love you! -Hello? -Hi. -Were you looking for me? -No. -No, no. -I was. Well, I was. -I mean, me too. -Oh. But this is just a coincidence. Yes, a coincidence, I hadn't spoken to him. -Oh. -Yes. -We both just got here. -I wanted to tell you, I just want to forget everything that happened and try again. Oh. Look guys. I wanted to try something different yesterday. Obviously, it didn't work out. And I doubt it ever will. -The threesome didn't work out, I agree. -Yes. But I honestly want to get to know you. Me too. No. And also no. But you like us. That's the problem. I like you both. If I'm with one of you, I'll be thinking of the other, and vice-versa. It's complicated. Is there anything we can do to fix it? It's not you guys. It's me. OK? Hello, Tumberitos, it's me, Benja, your influencer, the one and only, back again to the job I got fired from, after being left without my freedom for some time. How long would he have lasted in prison? I was thinking of you, while in my bed. Many nights. Let's go on. The people that are here suffer more than prisoners sometimes. And they don't have as many codes. You,Tumberos, have a lot more codes. Understand one thing, being in prison and not being free aren't the same thing. These people here are not free. I'm Benja, your Tumbero friend. Keep following me on social media. On Instagram, on Facebook... Twitter. And on Facebook... Especially. -Cheers! -That was amazing! -Yes? I thought at the beginning-- -It was a little dark, but you know? -Three thousand live followers! -Great! -Is that a lot? -I have no clue, but we'll figure it out from the reaction of our sponsors. The soda brand said congratulations. That's great! -Just wait till we start getting visitors. -Yes? I need your help getting ideas for a new video. -Yes? -Don't worry, I got this influencer role, -I got this-- -Excuse me. -Yes? -Could we take a picture together? -Yes. -OK, take it. -You want me to take it? -Yes, please. -Make sure it's a good shot. -Is that good? I'm going to hug you. I'm going to kiss you right here. -Yes, and click that. -Click it? OK. -Yes! -Do you like it? Yes, now follow me on Instagram. -Write-- -I mean, I'm followed, not a follower, but sure, I'll follow you. Would you like an autograph? -Can I get a pen? -Yes, of course. A piece of paper? Yes. Oh, yes! Oh, the digital generation. -Are we prepared, or what? -Prepared. Also, write "with love." -With love? I'll draw a heart. -Yes, a heart. -There you go. -Thanks. -Thank you. -No problem. Hey, is the office room empty? No, but the conference room. -Sure, thanks. -Bye, Son. Have you ever been with a Tumbero? -Not really? -No? Come, I'll show you the Tumbero office. Sure, come to work at your convenience. Can you move that stool? -This one? -Yes, that one. Listen, I was thinking. This just isn't for me. You know? This? -What do you mean? -The videos. I don't want to do them anymore. The job is more unhealthy than what I thought it would be-- -Unhealthy? Are you kidding me? -No. After all the time we invested in this, you're leaving me hanging? -Are you crazy? What the hell? -Wait, I'm not leaving you hanging. Do you think that shitty salary at CoWorking is enough? Uploading crap, making shitty copies? No way. -Don't you even think about it. -Listen to me. I have good news. I have money now. Let's do this. But let's do it the right way. I don't want to have cops extorting me later. What? -What? -Fine, but I have everything set up. I have a schedule to meet. I can't cancel things now. I'm not asking you to cancel anything, you can finish. We can still sell the videos we already made, but let's not take unnecessary risks, this is crazy. -Fine. Fine. -Yes? Whatever you say, "boss." Move that stool forward. -There? -To the left. -Yes. -There? Yes. -Good? -Yes. -What's up? -Hey. So? How did it go with the boys? Nothing happened, I kicked them both out. -Both? You sure? -Yes. So you couldn't get your cake and eat it too? I guess. No, wait. Girls, we need to learn to get to know ourselves, -that's the only way we can improve. -I agree with you. One hundred percent. I'm serious, if you don't get to know yourself, -your karma will stay inside-- -No, no. Don't say "karma." You don't know what that word means. -Why are you making fun of me? -I'm not. I mean it. I learned more during this time than during my whole life. -All of my other lives combined. -No! Yes. I'll be outside. You're idiots. She said "lives." She's not right. -No, you think so? -I swear. -Yes. -Honestly, I like her being optimistic. Besides, I thought you loved Buddhism and that Zen crap. No, I'm serious, she's not alright. This isn't an improvement. She's not. It's like a phase of her bipolar disorder. I'm afraid that if she's being so positive now, -she could relapse later. -No, no, relax. -We have to trust her. -Trust, really? You shouldn't always trust. -Axel? -Who is he? My first love. Destiny brought us together again. My friends, keep following me on social media, on Instagram... This idiot always comes out on top. I told you, Benjamín would be a problem for us. I thought he'd be in jail longer. I thought they weren't getting along. Don't underestimate the love between idiots. -We have to figure something out. -Any ideas? I don't know. Cancel it so it doesn't work against us, or incorporate it so it works in our favor. What about the power of love? That's killed by the power of resentment. -I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. -Yes, yes. I'll send you my dentist bill later, you knocked a tooth out. -Too bad. -You're never going to like me. -No. -No? Fine. What a pleasant reunion, I'll leave you both to catch up. -Thank you. -Bye. I'm never going to forgive you, you broke my heart, you idiot. I know, I was an idiot. -I also was kind of stupid. -Kind of? -Yes, only kind of. -But stupid. I fell in love, in your trap. In your lies. It was terrible, you were such an ass. Still, we are who we are now because of our past. Wow, you're so pragmatic. By the way, how's your heart? -It's good. -You got a transplant? Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm taking medications and some restrictions. I mean, that's life. If you could get over me, you can get over anything. There you go again, acting like you're the shit. Quick question. What are you doing here? Business matters. I'm an idiot for asking. Did you finish those "business matters?" Yes, I did, but I like this place. I'm planning on staying a little longer. OK. BENJA: LEFT YOUR NAME AT THE TABLE. I'LL BE WAITING. ÁLVAREZ: OK. NATALIA: I'M WAITING. HOW MUCH LONGER? BENJA: COMING. -I'm glad you're not in jail anymore. -Me too. -I imagine so. -Yes. I've been busy with my dad's business. I'm still not used to it. It's hard. -But-- -Yes. The problems of a rich girl. Right? From what I heard, you're not having that hard a time. Twice the allowance. -What do you mean? -Nothing. Can I help you? I'm looking for someone. Facundo. Listen, my lawyer will be contacting you about the divorce. Not a problem. Meanwhile, you'll be married to an ex-convict. That's not a problem. But don't worry, you'll get your things back. To begin with, the apartment is yours. Take it. Where are you going to live? Either with my dad, or with Flor and Alma, so I'm not alone. I see. Is this charity work, Miss Beltrán? Of course not, Benja. It's only your part. Have a good day. -And him? -I know him, Alberto, it's OK, thanks. Why are you here, Dad? -You didn't answer my calls. -How did you know I work here? Come. No, I can tell you what I came to say right here. I want everyone to know you're my son. I'm Facundo's father. What are you looking at? What? Dad, please! Stop that. -Julia, I'm sending those emails now. -Don't worry, I already did. -Can you help me with something else? -With? With part of the two million you made selling the app. Technically, only one of those millions is mine. Fine, a million. You didn't tell me about it. Aren't you going to pay back what you owe me? What do I owe you? -Everything, Rodri. Everything! -Wait. What we lost wasn't yours or mine, it was Dad's, technically, I don't owe you that much. I can't believe you said that, Rodri, -are you kidding me? -Calm down, please. You're right. -I'll loan you something, let me-- -Stick that money up your ass! That money won't last you a minute! Asshole! I guess that's a sensitive topic. I'll give you what you want, but don't make a scandal here. -Why, are you embarrassed of me? -No. Are you ashamed that everyone will know? -That your dad is a drunk? -No, Dad. -What's the problem? -Wait, Dad, they can fire me for this. Ungrateful asshole. Here. -You wouldn't exist without me. -Here, take this for now. -I'll come tomorrow for more. -Is there a problem, Facu? -No. -Hi, Sir, I'm Facu's boss. You look like an asshole. I need him inside, he needs to help me with something. Stop hiding from me. I can also look for your mom anytime I want. I know where she lives. Bye, idiot. I love it, it's great. I love your hair too. I want you to show your virginal part, and then I want you to let loose completely. -Got it? Ready. -Yes. Have you ever done this before? No, I've never made a video like this before. But I'd love to. People always think I'm angelical. A virgin. But I'm a sex machine. I love it. Great. What do you think, boss? How about a farewell porn video? -This generation is always on their cell. -Yes, always. -Always. -They train with their phones. I want to buy one of these. I imagine so. Now that you have power. Money. Why don't you buy a house? Put your bicycle there. -Right? -Yes, I'm buying a house. Can you do me a favor? -Yes. -It's a tip. Don't buy stupid shit. Don't be like Rodri, I'm sure he will. -I won't. -Good. No, I'm going to invest, but using my brain. Good. I'll do it the smart way. All jokes aside, I'm... I'm very happy you're doing great. -Thanks. -You're welcome. You know what? I haven't celebrated yet. Not appropriately. And I'd love to celebrate with you. If you want. We should go out for dinner. -Yes? -Why? Why now? I mean, I'm not interested in money. That's exactly why. That's why I'm asking you out. Without any expectations? -No expectations at all. -Only as friends? -Just to get a drink? -Just for a little buzz. -Buzz. We can laugh. -We can talk. About life. -I... -Tonight. Tonight? Sure. Oh, yes! Oh, Yes, please! Right here, yes! You're making me see stars! The whole galaxy! The Big Bang! Oh, yes! Harder, harder! Harder, harder! Yes! Don't be so loud, someone might call the police. Oh, yes, let them come! They're all invited to come! Yes, harder, harder, harder! -Malena? Malena? -Hey. Malena, are you OK? -Malena? Hey. -Malena? -Hey. -Malena? What's wrong? What happened? She's dead. What are you saying? Calm down, Facu. Have a seat, relax. What a shitty day you've had. But calm down. Don't feel embarrassed. This happens in all families. If you only knew about mine. Thanks, Octavio, I didn't know how to get away. Every time I see him, I freeze. I don't know what to do. But... Did he hit you when you were a kid? I wish it was just me. He'd hit my mom, my siblings. One day, my mom decided to run away with us. But that guy would always find us. He won't stop bothering us till he dies. I know it sounds bad but I'm hoping he does. I hope he dies. I can't stand him. That's OK. Don't feel guilty about that. Facu, if you feel that way, he obviously deserves it. -Yes? -Yes. I thought I should be ashamed of my parenting skills, but your dad was so much worse. Let's change the subject, Want some coffee? -It's been a long day. Come on. -Octavio, wait. Please, don't get into any trouble. -Why are you telling me that? -I know you asked Álvarez for bail money. -You look good, kid. -Yes. You, not so much. Arrogant as always. I thought you'd be more down to earth after being in jail. No, not really, I'm still the same, always. You see, kid? Never say never. -How much do you need? -No, wait, I don't need anything. Why the fuck am I here then? I need to know how much my father borrowed from you. Your dad didn't borrow anything. No? Don't act dumb, Octavio. Why else would you talk to Álvarez? You're right. You're right. Fine. But it wasn't Álvarez. Ariana gave me the bail money. Wait, who else would give him the money? How the fuck would I know? Why am I here? Don't get mad, I just want to know. I'm tired of waiting, Benja. Are you coming, or what? Natalia? -Dad? -He's your dad? Subtitle translation by: Carolina Salazar
