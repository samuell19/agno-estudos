[MUSIC PLAYING] ARMY ANNOUNCER returning from bombing mission. Ground floor attention. Flight C, returning from bombing mission. Ground floor attention. [TRUMPETS] [VRRRRRRRR] -Only two of them back. [VRRRR] [SQUEAK] -We got through all right, sir. Smashed the tankers and the hanger. -Good. What happened to Lieutenant Davis' ship? -I don't know for sure, sir. We were up ahead, tearing for home. And Davis cut in on the radio and reported zeros on his tail. Right after that, his radio went out. -Hmm. Well, get yourself some food and then turn in your reports. -I'm afraid they're lost, sir. -As long as there's gas in the tank, there's still a chance. BOMBER: Yes, sir. [SQUEAK] [SLAM] -Well, the boys certainly do a job. Take a look at those pictures. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Nice work. -No use holding up the intelligence report any longer, is there? [MUSIC PLAYING] -I suppose not. -G2. Major Stanlov. Report on operation 6W. Mission successful. Two bombers returned. One missing. Yes. Lieutenant Jonathan Davis and crew. Compose the following. Co-pilot, Lieutenant Jack Sarno. Bombardier Sergeant Harold Trask. Radio Sergeant. ARMY ANNOUNCER (MEGAPHONE): Ground floor attention. Bomber coming in. Ground floor attention. Bomber coming in. -Hold that report. ARMY ANNOUNCER (MEGAPHONE): Bomber coming in. -Corpsman, I'll call you later. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPUTTER SPUTTER] -Holy Christopher. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Sarno? -Killed in action. -Sergeant Trask? -Killed in action. -Sergeant Blasboom? Sergeant Pattis? -Missing. -Missing? -I'd have never been able to bring the bomber back if it hadn't been for Pattis. -Do you want to give us the details now? We're-- we're holding up the report. -Kind of hard to explain in an ordinary report, sir. What happened out there was all mixed up with what happened years ago. See, Pattis and I went to school together. He was a typical slum kid. Kicked around from the start. Had a chip on his shoulder against the whole world, and me in particular. Wasn't his fault. His father was in the pen most of the time. And my father was a school principal. Lost track of him after we grew up. 'Til I went in the district attorney's office. Few run-ins with him in my line of work. I could never hang anything on him. JON DAVIS (VOICEOVER): One day last year, I went down to Coney Island, where he was running a shooting gallery. [CROWD CHATTERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Coffee. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BANG] [BANG] [BANG] [BANG] [BANG] [LAUGHTER] -You see. It's as easy as eating cake. Here, let me show you. Get it up there. -OK. -That's it. Ha-ha. -What do do now? -Squeeze, baby. Squeeze. -Ah, Foxy. I thought you were gonna teach me. -Oh, uh, the trigger, baby. [BANG] -I hit it. -A bullseye. [LAUGHTER] [BANG] [LAUGHTER] -Hello, Foxy. [BANG] -Hit the road. -But Foxy. -Shove off. -Well of all the sluggy guys. -What do you want, copper? -Sorry about your father. -What are you trying to do, serve your conscience? -What happened wasn't my fault. I just took him in for a routine check up. -Oh, sure. Every time the old man would get a job, you'd show up and they'd bounce him. You never let him forget for a minute that he was an ex-con. -That isn't true. -You hounded him to death. I have a good mind to-- -Go ahead. You're a brave muzzler, aren't you? -That gun holds only seven shots. You knocked down seven ducks, so. -Very sharp. But you always were. -About your father, Foxy. I had to do a job. Came here to tell you I'm sorry. -And I'm telling you I won't forget. Someday I'm going to get you just the way you got my old man. -The Japs might beat you to it. I enlisted yesterday. So long. -So long, sucker. [WA-WA-WA-WA] -Nice chat. -That was Foxy. To him, any guy who'd enlist would be a sucker. They assigned me to Kelly Field. I came out as a flying sergeant. I wanted all the fundamentals, so I volunteered for gunnery school. They sent me to HAGS. That's Harlingen Army Gunnery School. The tip of Texas, near the gulf. [VROOOOOOOOO] [DA-DU-DA-DU-DA-DU -You're all volunteers, and I'm not going to pull any punches. Your navigator may map your course. Your pilot may take you there. Your bombardier will destroy the objective. But it's up to you, the gunner, to smash the attacking enemy so that your bomber will come home safely. We can't take any chances on you. If you don't make good, you'll be washed out. You're either a good gunner or your a dead gunner. And the operation on which your ship is sent, will die with you. The safety of your ship, your safety, the safety of the entire crew, depends on what you learn here. Remember that, and I'm sure that you'll come through as the best gunners in any man's army. DRILL SERGEANT: Ready for squadrons. Attention. Bags on your shoulders. Flight. Second squadron. Make faces forward. March. Squadron, halt. Left face. Forward march. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Squadron, halt. Right face. Ready? One step forward. -Har. -At ease. Each flight will have an instructor who will stay with you throughout the entire course. Instructor for fight A, Sergeant Pattis. -Sergeant Jones. -Glad to know you, Jones. -You can put the bag down. What's your name? -Private Laswell. -Sleepy? -Kind of. -Ain't caught up since my last job. -Yeah, what was that? -Night clerk in an auto court. -Relax. -Gadget Blaine. Private Blaine, sir. Radio operator. -Glad to know you, Gadget. Button up. [SQUEAK] -Private Lunt, sir. Sure glad to be in your class. -Where you from, son? -Well, my home's not far from here. I sure hope I get to be a gunner, sir. -Yeah. Well, keep your nose clean and your eyes peeled, and you'll make it. -Hello, Foxy. -Well, fancy meeting you here. -Small war, isn't it? -Yeah. And not very exclusive. All right, men. You're on own. 'Til 5:30 in the morning. -It's the middle of the night. JON DAVIS: Hey, Foxy. -Listen. I can't help you being in my flight, copper. But outside of class, give me room. -Ah, forget the grudge, Foxy. We're both in the army for the same reason. -Yeah? I'm in it because I was drafted. Your in it because you're a chump. -You're just blowing off steam. -OK, you be the hero. I got a soft touch where I can order schtups like you around for the duration. Say, I bet it'd break your heart to get washed out, wouldn't it? -Wouldn't make me happy. -Well, that's splendid, sergeant. I'll see you in class. -From the man behind it. Even though the gun is a gunner's best friend. -And now, it's a knife and a fork. [SLAP] -Blaine. -Yes, sir. -Uh, what is that thing? Oh, it's just a gadget I invented. -America's secret weapon. -Oh, no, sir. It's a-a tool of a 100 uses. See? First, ice pick. Knife. And a fork. And like that, a coat hanger. And a bottle opener. Corkscrew. -Well, isn't that wonderful. -Yes, sir. -Folks back in Mahoney's garage in Peoria said I was a mechanical wizard. -You don't say. -Yes, sir. -Anybody got any, uh, tobacco? -Tobacco? -Yes, sir. Oh, I forgot to tell you. It's a pipe, too. -Now, sit down and pay attention. -Yes, sir. -Sergeant Davis, what is meant by a vertical lead? -Vertical angle by which a gun must be moved, above or below a straight line from the muzzle to the target, so the projectile will pass through the target. -You're pretty smart, aren't you? -Uh-uh. Very smart. -Laswell. Laswell, what is meant by a vertical lead? -The vertical angle in which the gun must be moved, above or below a straight line, from the muzzle to the target, so that the projectile will pass through the target. [LAUGHTER] -Look, Sandy, you handle it this way. -I'll never get through this course. -Being a gunner means a lot to you, doesn't it? -I've got to make it. If I don't-- -Davis. What do you think we're running here, a day nursery? You expect to carry your own personal mechanic in combat? A little help doesn't do any harm, does it? -Well, you stick to your own chopper. -Don't let him get tour goat, kid. He's riding you because he can't get a rise out of me. -Well, that's a fine-looking junk pile. You're supposed to line up everything orderly. How arr you going to put that garbage together in two minutes, blindfolded? -Easy. Try me. -Gather round, gents. The great mechanical wizard is about to perform the blindfold test. Two minutes, huh? This I got to see. All right now. Go. -There you are. Completely assembled. -That's wonderful, Gadget. Simply wonderful. -Yes, sir. -All assembled. -Yes, sir. -Uh-huh. -Now what do we do with this piece? The malfunction of every one of these guns. Pick one and fire it until it jams. Then find out what's wrong it. All right, let it go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] [RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT] -All right. [RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT] -Davis. That's your gun. [MUSIC PLAYING] -That's how you stop it. The star pupil always gets the runaway gun. -Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Pull. [BANG] -Miss. -Pull. [BANG] -I got it. I got the son-of-a-gun. -Eight out of 25. -That's enough to pass, isn't it? -Yeah, by a hair. You're up next. -I did all right, huh? -You bet you did. -Go ahead. -Pull. [TSHUCK-TSCHUCK] -Miss. -Pull. -Miss. -First time, I thought it was a mistake. -I don't know what you're talking about. -You're purposely trying to mis-score me. -Don't be a dope. You missed. -If you're going to wash me out, that's about as nasty a way as any. -Are you calling me a liar? -Yes, I am. If you weren't in uniform, I'd-- -Don't let that stop you. [MUSIC PLAYING] GUNNER TRAINEE: He'll be tossed out. -Stop it. Cut it out. -Which of you started this fight? -I'm afraid I lost my temper, sir. -You have an excellent training record at Kelly, Davis. -Won't happen again, sir. -Another such incident won't be overlooked. You understand, sergeant. -Yes. -You may go. -If you think I'm going to -I don't expect anything from you, all right? -Then go back to your rover boys and tell them about your good deed. -Why, you-- -Go ahead. Why don'y you hit me? Well, sucker, that time, it almost worked. [SLAM] [SQUEAK] -What happened? -Ah, they threw me in the bullpen for a few hours. Then the old mad decided to give me a second chance. -Oh, that's a good deal. -Next time, I think I'll finish the job. -Why don't you two guys get together? Foxy's not such a bad guy. -Look, Sandy. I don't want to discuss it. -Well, you're lucky, Jon. They just busted a buddy of mine for breathing at the general. -What do you mean, breathing? -Just breathing. Course, one of his front teeth was missing and he made a funny noise. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Jon? -Yeah? -Jon. -Uh? -We get 24 hours leave Saturday. -Did you wake me up just to tell me that? -Well, no. But would you like to spend the weekend down on our ranch? -Sandy, you got yourself a guest. -Good. -Good night, Sandy. -Good night. [MUSIC PLAYING] [VROOO-VROO] -Overnight pass. -Baby, I'm leaving. -Heading for home, [INAUDIBLE]? -Nah, not enough gals to go around. -Same situation all through Texas. -Huh. -OK. [VROOO-VROOO] -Seen Private Lunt around? -Not that I know of, sergeant. -He's supposed to meet me here. -OK. -Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] [VROO-VROO] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Not so fast, soldier. Your pass. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, there you are, Foxy. Sorry to be late. -All set, Sandy? -Yep. Let's go. -Say, what is this? -You don't think I'm going to spend the weekend with him, do you? -Well, gee, fellas. You can't walk out on me now, after I had my sister drive all the way up to get us. -What's the matter, Sandy? Are we going to have to rope your guests? -Sister. -Your sister? -Well, that's different. Come on. -Well, we were only kidding. -Sure, Sandy's a sucker for a riff. -My sister, Peggy. Sergeant Pattis and Sergeant Davis. -How do you do? -Hello. -Sandy's written and told me about both of you. -Well, I hope he kept it decent. -He's been keeping you a secret. -Well, I'll drive. -Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -How you doing back there, Sandy? -Fine. I'm doing fine. [LAUGHTER] -You know, one more piece of that Southern Fried Chicken and I'll be talking with a Dixie accent. [LAUGHTER] -Ah, it's wonderful. -Yes. -It's the last set up of the barracks. -I'll say it is. -Sandy. Why don't you show Sergeant Davis some of your work? -Oh, he wouldn't want to be bothered, mother. -What is that, Mrs. Lunt? -Well, he paints. He's very good, too. Go on, Sandy. -Come on, let's have a look. -All right, if you want to be bored. -Excuse us. -Sure. -Save the next one for me, will you? -That's a promise. -Now, you children have fun. I'm right in the midst of a great mystery. There are more murders. -Don't forget to let us know who done it. -I won't. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You're quite close to Matamoros across the border here, aren't you? -Uh-huh. It's about 15 miles. -There's a new band at Pablos. Out of this world. -Yes. So I heard that's that new spot, isn't it? -That's right. How about taking a run over? -Oh, that's just a great idea. I'll tell you what. You gather up Sandy and Davis, and I'll go get the car. -Gather up Sa-- Oh, sure. Sure. I'll gather them up. -Meet me out front. -Good. [MUSIC PLAYING] [VROOM-VROOM] -You know, it's funny they'd want to stay home and study. I thought they came down here to relax. -Yeah, I thought it was kind of funny myself. But you know, after all, people are. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Anybody who can paint like that ought to be in the camouflage division. -Not me. I'm going to be a gunner. -Yeah, you're a ferocious guy. Excuse me, Sandy. I got this dance with your sister. [MUSIC PLAYING] -This one's mine, F-- [MUSIC PLAYING] -You know, if this class comes through OK, I may get a commission. -Really? -Yeah. -Tell me more about yourself. -Oh, you wouldn't be interested. -Well, of course I would. I like to know about people. -Really? All right. My mother was a Hindu princess and my father was a pilot. It was a case of love the first sight, so he kidnapped her, and I was born on a South Sea island. -I've never known anyone quite like you. -Well, that goes double. You know, I've never known anybody quite like you. -See what the Army's done for you. -Yeah, it's all right. [MUSIC PLAYING] -That's funny. I was sure this was a shortcut. -Very nicely done. -What? -I've used this gag lots of times. It's perfect. Moonlight, orange blossoms, beautiful. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Now, wait a minute. All I said was, I thought this was a shortcut. -Well, that's what I mean. Why go the long way round? [MUSIC PLAYING] [VROOM-VROOM] -Can I say anymore? -Why, of course not. From your viewpoint, it was just a natural mistake. -Welcome home. -Hello. -So you ran out on us, eh? You know, Emily Post says that isn't very nice. -But I thought you wanted to study. -Foxy. -Is that what he told you? -Well, it's been a lovely evening. Good night, kiddies. -Good night. -What a guy. -What a guy. -I'm quite a guy myself, if you'll only give me a chance to prove it. -Really? -You know, you promised me a dance. The Yankees are very, very stubborn. [MUSIC PLAYING] -So Foxy outsmarted you in the first round. -I admit, I felt like a wounded pigeon. But he had one advantage. He could leave the post every night and I couldn't [MUSIC PLAYING] JON DAVIS (VOICEOVER): We machine guns at stationary targets. Sandy was doing better now. And I, maybe because I had Peggy on my mind, was getting worse. Foxy did everything he could to wash me out. It came the big day when we advanced to firing 50 calibers at moving targets. There was to be a post dance that night. Foxy'd invited Peggy, and gotten her s pass to watch the firing trial. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ready, Barclay. -Roger. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ready for firing. -Roger. [CROWD TALKING] -Better watch your eardrums. Short bursts. And watch your tracers for lead correction. [RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT-A-TAT] -If they're all firing at the same target, how can you tell who hits it? -Each one has different color bullets. They leave their mark on the targets. [RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT-A-TAT] -[INAUDIBLE]. -Huh? -[INAUDIBLE]. I've been thinking about you all week. [LAUGHTER] -All right, jitter bug, the Army can wait. -Don't forget. -You looked mighty good out there, Sandy. I'm glad you were here to give me moral support. -Load your guns while I pick up the target. -I suppose these target trials are very important. -This and the last step. Firing from one plane at targets towed by another. If they pass these last two phases, they're in. -And if they don't? -We trade them for the Brooklyn Dodgers. [CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA] -That one's ready. Here's your dirty laundry. -On the next batch, give me some real speed. -I've been running the car 35. -Well, run it full speed this time. -But my instructions say-- -OK, listen. There's a guy out there, I want to slap his ears down. -But the car is liable to jump the track. What's the matter, you chicken? -I tell you, it's not good to hold the track at full speed. Anyhow, I'm not supposed to. -OK. I'll do it myself. -How you going to get off if it gets going too fast? -Jump. [CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Runaway car. Sergeant Pattis is on it. Out cold. Runaway car. Sergeant Pattis is on it. Out cold. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, got the headquarters on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Don't stand there doing nothing. Go ahead, [INAUDIBLE]. -The automatic clipper won't work. He sagged over the accelerator. I can't stop it. He sagged over the accelerator. I can't stop it. I can't stop it. -We've got to do something. I can't stop it. -We've got to do something. He'll be smashed to bits. [MUSIC PLAYING] -He'll be killed. Foxy, darling, are you all right? -Peggy. -Oh. -What's all the commotion? -Sleeper, come here. Ms. Jones, Private Laswell. BOTH: How do you do? -Ms. Cassidy. Mr. Blaine. -How's the weather up there? -[INAUDIBLE]. -Hi. -Gadget. Sleeper. [CROWD TALKING] -Having trouble with the drinking machine, sir? -I put a nickle in it and nothing happened. -Well, you just let me at it. -I don't know whether I told you or not, honey, but I'm a mechanical wizard. -So that's what you are. I was wondering. -You'd better let him fix it, girls, or he'll pout all evening. -Here, hold my hat. I got work to do. This is interesting. I told you not to start with that thing. -Reminds me of something I once took apart in Peoria. -Get that fixed, or I'll take you apart. -Give him a chance, boys. [MUSIC PLAYING] -How is he? I-- you were in there so long. -The doctor says he can leave by morning. -Oh, that's fine. I know you-- you came down as his date, but how about going to the dance with me? -Well it's-- it's been sort of a strenuous day, Jon. And I think maybe I'd better go on home. -I understand. -Ship-shape. Never even mussed my hair. My hat please. Who's got a nickle? -There you are. [MUSIC PLAYING] -What'd I tell you? It's working. It's all yours, Lieutenant. [HISS] [LAUGHTER] -Peggy, I'll only be here another week. I know this sounds kind of sudden, but I see the wars change a lot of-- -I'm sorry, Jon, what were you saying? -Gosh, do I have to start all over again? -Jon. Foxy just asked me to marry him. -Marry Foxy? -Um-hmm. -You surprised? -Yeah, sort of. -Well, to tell you the truth, I am too, a little bit. You know Foxy. -Yeah. I know Foxy. -Well, see you at graduation. -Bye. -Bye. [VROOM] -The trouble with you, Davis. You played the game too straight. -Sprag, you're a confounded cynic. -She had the right to make up her own mind. We had a lot of work to do. And I tried to forget. JON DAVIS (VOICEOVER): We had learned preliminaries. Now came the real test, firing from a plane in simulated combat as a towed target. Two such flights might mean the difference between getting our gunner's wings. Or being grounded for the duration. We were plenty nervous that day in the flight room, waiting for our turn to go up. [CROWD TALKING] -You need those fingers, Sandy. -This is worse than waiting to have a tooth pulled. ARMY ANNOUNCER (MEGAPHONE): Flight B coming in from air-to-air trial. Flight A up next. On the line in five minutes. -All right, boys. That's us. Check your equipment. -Hey, button up your Mae West. You never can tell when you'll end up in the gulf. -Am I glad that's over. -How'd you do, Chubby? -How should I know? I had my eyes closed most of the time. -Don't worry about our flight. We'll lick the pants off of you guys. -Yes. Wake me when the score comes in. -Uh-oh. Here comes the bad news. [EXCITED CHATTERING] -Well, I'm mighty proud of you fellas. Averaged above passing, with one exception. -Exception? Hope it ain't me. -Three? There must be some mistake. -I'm sorry, Johnston. That was your second try. You'll be OK with the ground crew. -No, but I want to be a gunner. That's what I joined up for. -I'm sorry, Johnson. -Never mind, kid. You tried. ARMY ANNOUNCER (MEGAPHONE): Flight A to the flying line. Flight A to the flying line. -So you think you did pretty good up there today, eh, Benson? -I'll lay even money your flight doesn't score as well. -I'll take some of that. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is strictly between Benson and me. A month's salary we beat you. How about it, sucker? -You got a bet, soldier. -Better draw that money in advance. I'm going to need it for a wedding ring. -OK. Hey, where's Gadget? Come on, Gadget. We're up. Hey. What the devil are you so interested in? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come on, lunk. Will you? [CROWD TALKING] [VROOOO- VROOOO] -Target ready. This is the real test. You're either a gunner or you're a false alarm. So you'd better make it good. [INAUDIBLE] procedure rotation. Private Blaine, plane 23. Go ahead. [VROOO-VROOO] -Sergeant Davis. Plane 25. Go ahead. [VROOO- VROOO] -Private Laswell. Plane number 22. Go ahead. [VROOO-VROOO] -Private Lunt. Plane number 24. Go ahead. [VROOO-VROOO] -What's the matter with you, number 24? Why don't you fire? [VROOO-VROOO] -Take me down. Take me down. [VROOO-VROOO] -What are you going in for? [VROOO-VROOO] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Why didn't you fire? -I'm sorry, Foxy. I-I tried, but I couldn't. -You tried. I can excuse you if you'd fired and missed. -I tried to fire. I tried, but something happened. I can't explain it. I got sick. -You didn't get sick. Just scared spit-less. I ought to swat your silly noggin. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Slow down, kid. That happens to lots of guys. -Let me alone, will you? Just let me alone. -I hated to see that happen in live flight. -What about Sandy? What happened? -He'll go up tomorrow and score. Or else. -It'll break the kid's heart, finishing up like this. -Why did he volunteer? You'd think a guy would know inside whether he can take it or not. -That lad's not scared. Not the way Foxy thinks. -What do you mean? -We've all got reasons for being here. Maybe we're convinced we've got to wipe out the Nazis and Japs to keep them from taking us over. Maybe we're fighting for another deal. Maybe we just want to get out there and cover ourselves with glory. But not Sandy. He has some personal reasons. Keeps driving him. Keeps him tied up in knots. That's what happened today. He's tied in knots. -Talk like you know it, Jonesy. -I've seen fellas like him. Quiet, gentle kids. They worry themselves sick. But once they into combat with dive bombers screaming overhead and lead whistling around their ears, they're out in front, showing the tough guys what a real soldier's like. -Wait a minute. You mean, you've seen action? -I was with the British at Dunkirk. I gotta get my things. -How do you like that Jonesy? With the British at Dunkirk. And I thought that guy was a [INAUDIBLE]. -I hope he's right about Sandy. Wait far too long tomorrow, I don't think he'd be any better tomorrow than he was today. -Where's Lunt? -I saw him a while ago, heading toward the chapel. -Button up. -[INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Look. Sandy'll want his second chance. -Do you think he ought to go up tomorrow? Let him get his nerve up. -I'm in charge of this flight, Davis. When I want any advice, I'll ask for it. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Why do I have to be like that? Why can't I have just a, a little of? He gave his life for his country. Like, no, he was never afraid. I promised I would. Please. I've tried so hard. Can't-- can't you give me some help? Dear Lord. Help me to find the strength. Be with me tomorrow. And when I'm up there again, I've got to make good on. I just got to. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Sandy. I'm sorry about what happened this afternoon. I, uh, I just hated to see you mess up your firing test. -I can't blame you. -Now look, kid. There are loads of jobs in the Army. Suppose you got into administration. You could be near home-- --[INAUDIBLE] another trial tomorrow. -Sure you are. I just hate to see you go up, that's all. -Thanks for trying, Foxy. I'll be all right tomorrow. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BVOOO-BVOOO-BWEW] [VROOOM VROOM] -After what happened yesterday, I sure got to hand it to the kid. -Private Lunt, plane 24. Go ahead and fire. [VROOO-VROOO] -Short bursts, Sandy. -I can't. It's a runaway gun. -Pitch your shoot. Quick. -Sandy didn't bail. -Plane 25, 23, and 22, return to the post. I'll call the crash boat. -Stay where you are. -Crash boat. Crash boat. -Crash boat. Lieutenant Savage speaking. Go ahead. -[INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]. Three miles beyond life [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] Hurry. -Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Not too long, please. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hello, Sandy. -Foxy. -I should never have let you go up. -My own fault. Runaway gun. -What did you say? -I had set up that gun myself. Never was any good at those things. How'd the boys make out? -Oh, fine. They all passed. Sleeper and Gadget are outside. -They're getting their wings Saturday? -Yeah. So are you, in a month or so. -No, you kidding Foxy? I'm washed out for good. -I tell ya, it's Foxy's fault. He hadn't called him a coward in front of the company and forced him to go up again-- Good evening, Miss Lunt, we were waiting around to hear about Sandy. -You know, there's something you really oughta invent. -Yeah, What? -A zipper for your lip. -I'm gonna let you get some rest, kid. -Wait. -This what you want? -My father. All he sent back from Hawaii. -Don't talk, Sandy. -Th-- They came over at dawn. Hickam Field. He-- he never woke up. They sent us this. I swore I'd carry it over Tokyo. -You will, Sandy. You and me. We'll fly over Tokyo together. -You gonna ask for combat? -Sure. We'll both get in the same outfit. -Thank you. -Well now, look Sandy-- -Ca-- carry it for me, Foxy. You're a good fighter. Like my father. I never made it in. -Doctor! -[GASP] Sandy! Oh, Sandy, Sandy. Oh, Sandy. -Peggy, I-- -You made him go up. After you knew how he was, and you made him do it. -Peggy, there was nothing I could do. -Don't touch me. [SOBBING] [MUSIC - "THE US AIR FORCE"] -Men of Hollington, within the next few weeks, you will be fighting for your country in Alaska, the South Seas, Briton, Africa, on all the battle fronts of this globe circling war. That you are ready is evidenced by the fact they you stand before me to receive your gunner's wings. Wear them proudly, for they are your mark of achievement. ARMY ANNOUNCER: Sergeant Sergeant Henry Jones. Sergeant Jonathan Davis. Sergeant Jackson Laswell. Sergeant Lancelot Blaine. Sergeant Lancelot Blaine. -We also honor a member of your class who is no longer with us. He did not find the going here easy. But above all else, he wanted to be a gunner. He knew his handicaps, yet despite a first failure, he came back to try again. His was the kind of courage which inspires the rest of us to keep fighting no matter what the odds. No matter what the personal cost. On behalf of the Army Air corps, and this class, we award, posthumously, to Sergeant Sanford Lunt, the wings of an aerial gunner. Mrs. Lunt, you may be sure of our deep sympathy and friendship. -My boy would have been very proud, Colonel. Very proud. -The first time since he was a kid kicking around the gutters of New York, spitting in the face of fate, Foxy seemed licked. -I suppose the girl was through it. -It was a tough break for him. Then I was in love with her too. She let me kiss her goodbye, no promise of course. But I left with the feeling that when I came back I had a chance. A few days later, I got my commission. I was assigned here. -You mean you left without kissing Foxy goodbye? -He wouldn't even see me. I guess he'd hated me more than ever. After I was here a few weeks, you sent for me, I remember-- You sent for me, sir? -Yes. The, uh, San Francisco plane brought something for you. A new tail gunner. Sergeant! You two know each other? -Yes, sir, we do. -Take charge lieutenant, I'm due on the line. -Yes, sir. I thought you didn't want any action? -A guy can change his mind, sir. -Never mind the formality. -Yes, sir. -Coincidence, them sending you down here. -Coincidence my foot, sir. I asked to be sent. -Look, Foxy, if you're going to let that grudge carry you 5,000 miles-- -Oh no, it wasn't that sir. No indeed. It was a picture of a South Sea babe that I saw in a magazine. And you know how I am about those-- -Come on, come on. Meet the rest of the crew. -Yes sir. -Tench-hut! At ease. Look what just dropped in. -Hi, Gadget. Hello, Sleeper. Getting caught up in your napping? -Hi. -Hello. -Sergeant Traska, bombadier. Foxy Pattis, our tail gunner. -Glad to know ya. -Same here. -Park it right here, I'm upstairs. -Oh, swell. Say, uh, uh, wasn't Jonesy with you fellas? -That was his bunk. -They're shipping him back in the same plane that brought you in. -Jonesy? JON DAVIS: Yeah. One unlucky slug from a zero. -Aw, that's tough. He was a good guy, Jonesy. -Darn right he was a good guy. And so was Sandy. JON DAVIS: Gadget! -What's a matter? -Cut it out. See you guys later. -Here, let me help you. -Let's get on over to the PX before it closes. -Closes? Well, they don't close 'til-- -They know that. Let 'em alone, Trask. I thought it was going to be hot in the South Seas. Brr. JON DAVIS (VOICEOVER): resented Foxy's presence from the beginning. They still blamed Foxy for what had happened to Sandy. Didn't want him around. But such close quarters, sooner or later, there was bound to be a blow up. -Heh. you forgot to jump, sucker. -I'm not very good at this. -Sandy taught him how to play. He wasn't very good either. -Now listen. I've taken all the riding I'm going to take, see? -Yes? -If either one of you mentions Sandy's name again, I'll-- -Tench-hut! What's the matter with you guys? -Nothing, sir. He was just-- -Now listen to me, both of you. We've got to work together. Otherwise, we're no good as a bombing crew. If you don't want to team with Foxy, then you can ask for a transfer. And by George, I'll recommend it too. -We don't want that, sir. -Well then, stop acting like a couple of school girls. -Yes, sir. -Get out on the line, and make the ship ready for a bombing mission. -You mean, we're going up? -I don't know, we've got orders. Go out and check the ship. -I hope this isn't just another fire drill. -Foxy, go on up and check your guns. -Yes sir. And, uh, thanks. -What? -Thanks. They were getting me down. -I thought I heard wrong. You're welcome, Sergeant. Wait a minute. I've got something for you. -Now, you reach this point, you each head for your own targets. Lieutenant Brandt, you'll concentrate on the hangars. -Yes, sir. -Get any ships in the open, get them too. -Right sir. -Lieutenant Davis, your objective is the barracks. You saw the pictures? -Yes, sir. -Ferguson gets the tanker, is that clear? -Yes sir. -Now, if you meet any fighters, don't stop to spar. Your job is to unload your bombs and get your ships home safely. We can't afford to lose any of them. -We understand, sir. -That's all. Set your watches. Take off is set for 13:30 hours. Good luck, and give 'em the works. -Yes, sir. -Well, here we go, boys. -Move out. -Sergeant Trask to Lieutenant Davis. We're in the danger zone, be on the alert. -Wide awake, sir. No signs of any life yet. -Sergeant Blaine, Lieutenant Davis. Getting close, Gadget. -Going up, sir. -Take over, Sarnoff. -OK. -Clear. Hey, Foxy. How's everything back there in the caboose? -Pretty lonesome. -I'll speak to the Colonel. Maybe the next time he'll send a hostess along. -Order one for me too, Lieutenant. -There it is men, right straight ahead. Lieutenant Brandt, Ferguson, Lieutenant Davis. This is where we part company. Take your spots. -Roger. -Going in low and fast. Is that the way you want it, Trask? -Roger. -Bomb bay door is open. -Give it the gun. Give it to 'em, Trask. Good work, Trask. -Zowie! Give 'em one for my uncle. -Your uncle? -Yeah, he used to sell 'em scrap iron. Let's give 'em some free. -OK, here's for your uncle, the stinker. -Ha ha! -Bet they got a bang out of that. -Good boy, Trask. Won't be sleeping there tonight. -Bombs away, sir. We're staring the attack. -Aw, gimme a chance, Adam. I want to break in this chopper. -Not this troop, Foxy. We've done our good deed for the day. See if the others are ready to go home. -Lieutenant Sarnoff to Lieutenants Brandt and Ferguson. How's tricks? They got the hangars and the tankers. They're up ahead of us, going home. -Good. It's funny we haven't seen any Jap planes. -No, we may have caught them all in the hangars. -I hope so. -That's a beautiful fire you left back there. [CHUCKLES] -Uh-oh. Zeroes way up on my left. -Everybody on the interphone, heads up. Zeroes on our tail. Upper left. We'll try to run them off. Put your guns on 'em. Understood? -OK. They're coming like bats. -I count five of 'em. -I can't see 'em from here. -Better call the others immediately. -Lieutenant Davis, Brandt, Ferguson. There's a block of Zeroes on our tail. -Need a hand? -Don't be a chump. You heard what the Colonel said. No matter what happens, get these ships home. -Right. Here's luck, fellas. -Now step on it, don't wait! -First blood. Hey Sleeper! One's going downstairs, get him! There's only three of 'em left. Their wing is down. Better take one, Gadget. -OK. -I got mine. -OK. Chalk up another one. Sleeper! Get him! He's going down under! Sleeper! Answer me! -That's all, sir. They ran out. -Sarnoff! Sarnoff, take over, I'm hit. Sarnoff. Gadget. Gadget, come on down and help me, I gotta make the landing, I-- Gadget, take up the motors. I'm gonna be landing it in the clear field ahead. -Trask, Sarnoff, Sleeper. -Yeah, he'll get plenty of sleep now. -Foxy, we may none of us come out of this alive. I'd feel a lot better if you and I could make it up. -I never learned how to talk, Jon. But maybe this will help. -"Dear Foxy, John wrote that you were down there with him. I know now I did you a terrible injustice, and I'm writing to ask you to forgive me. You were all just doing your job. Sandy would have gone up again, no matter what happened. He had to do his job too. About you and me, it's better that it ended as it did. You must realize that now. I'd never known anyone quite like you, and you felt the same way about me. With Jon, it's different. I haven't told him yet, but when he comes back, I'll be waiting. Please don't feel too bitter toward me, Foxy. Someday, when all this over, I'd like to see you again. Sincerely, Peggy." -Well, we can't all win. -She's a great girl. -Mm. You can say that again. -Lieutenant! Suppose I told ya I could get the motors working? -Can you? -You're asking me? The mechanical wizard? It's just the ignition wiring. Gimme about five minutes. But, are you sure you can lift her out of here? -You fix it, and we'll see. -I'll fix it. [GUNSHOT] -Hey, we got company. -Yeah, a sniper. Hurry up, get that wiring. -Well, how about that-- -Shut up! Get to work. Jon, you get at the controls, ready to take off. -There must be more than one of 'em. -Gadget, how long will it take ya to get that wiring done? -Oh, about five minutes, anyway. -Well, I'll hold 'em off as long as I can. And Gadget, don't start taking things apart. Put 'em together. [GUN COCKING] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] -Hurry up, Gadget! The place is alive with 'em! -Hurry up, Gadget. He can't hold them off much longer. -I'm doing the best I can. [GUNSHOTS] -OK. Try her now. -Atta boy. [ENGINE TURNING OVER] -Atta boy, Gadget. Go on back and signal Foxy. [GUNSHOTS] -Foxy! Come on, we're ready to go! -Tell 'em to take off, get going. -But Foxy, we can't leave ya. Foxy! -I can't make it. They'll have their grenades at ya before you get off. [GUNSHOTS] -He won't come. Said they'd get him before he made it. He wants you to leave. -He's crazy, get back there. [GUNSHOTS] -Foxy! Come on! -Get that bomber out of here, before I let you have it. Get going! Incoming, you lizards! You'll never get that bomber. [EXPLOSION] [GUNSHOTS] -All right. Here goes. -So long, sucker. How we doing, Sandy? JON DAVIS: He gave his life so we could fly our bomber home and use it again. We will Foxy, for you and Sandy, and Sandy's father. And all the others who died to keep the stars and stripes flying over free America. We'll keep smashing after them again and again. Until we finish them for good. That Foxy, I promise you.
