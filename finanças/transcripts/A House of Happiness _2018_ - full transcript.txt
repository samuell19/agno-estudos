Good morning, doctor. Good morning, Uncle Shui. Let's do a field test. Can you tell me your full name and age? Leong Shui. Most people call me Uncle Shui. Some of them call me Handsome Shui. This year, I think I'm 68 years old. Okay, Uncle Shui. Please repeat after me, 'A House of Happiness'. 'A House of Happiness'. All right, please try to read it reversely. This is a tricky question. Every year... May you have healthy life forever. All right. Can you tell me four types of fruit which have the word 'melon'? Winter melon, Sun melon, watermelon, and field melon. I also gift you a 'stupid melon'. You can't fool me. Uncle Shui, please repeat what I said just now. What I said just now. No, what I meant is the last question that I asked you. Uncle Shui, I am very sure that... your Alzheimer's disease... is getting worse When I first met May in Indonesia, I only realised that... I actually would fall in love again. Now only I know what second love is. Second love? I don't need second love. No one is as good as my Summer. Aunt Ha came at the right time, Uncle Shui is telling his history. No, he is talking the story of his puppy love. You're still talking? You still don't want to go back and want to keep drinking? What? You don't feel good once I mention Summer. I want to tell you, my unforgettable puppy love, the most beautiful memory. Summer, I love you. This is ridiculous. How could you fart while telling your romantic puppy love story? Aunt Ha, I don't know how you think, how could you tolerate with such smelly fart? Don't involve her, it has nothing to do with her. Okay, let's go home. Go home? That's my home, not yours. That's your hostel. My son hired you to serve me. You can never replace Summer. Can we go home now? Stupid, you are heading in the wrong direction. Don't follow her style. You can't call me like what she did. You don't let me call you like that, but I still want to. You want one stick right? I was selling ice-cream in front of the school those days. Of course except from the reason that many students would buy it, there was a secret too... which was every evening, my Summer would appear. Of course she is not Summer. Here you go. There is only one stick every time, you must be cheating! She is Summer. Can you see how beautiful she is? During that time, there was not many people with English names. However, she was always the special one. Moreover, Summer, this name sounds so fresh. Will I get three sticks free again if I buy one stick this time? Three sticks again? There must be something not right. Tell me. I... Yes. No. Tell me, why would I get three sticks free every time? If you don't tell me, you can't go after me. Actually, I… Stupid! It is very smelly! Look at her. After I farted, her look of holding breath is so cute. Actually, at that moment, I knew I would be in love with her. Good morning, Zhen Zhu. Good morning, Uncle Shui. I forgot to bring small change again. You are always like this. Your newspaper. Thank you. Place your bet now. Be quick, it's going to be revealed. It's going to be revealed. It's crab. Yes, I'm at Xing Fa grocery shop. -How dare you ignore me. -Ignore? -Let's see how I will punish you. -Punish! Do you need a speaker? Be smart. We'll arrest them without their knowledge. You said 7:30am, it's almost 8:00am now. You are good in ruining. Thank you for your information. Someone betrayed us, let's go! Betrayer, stop right there! -Chase them! -Chase them! -Stop right there! -Stop right there! Are you okay? Luckily you're all right. -All right? -I am not all right! You want red bean flavour right? Here you go. That's awesome, two sticks! Red bean flavour too? Here you go. Next customer. Three sticks. Here you go. Son, I have told you many times not to waste money. Saving is very important. The money is for you to study in the university. Kid, it is free for you. Uncle Shui, your time and my son's are different, his time is very expensive. Son, we are going for Mathematics class now, then English class and Piano class. I have paid all the fees, you have to go, all right? Furthermore, even if you get three sticks free, please don't eat. Those must be expired. Let me teach you, out of 10 businessmen, 9 of them are bad men. The 10th businessman... is a failure. You teach your son like that? You are pressuring your son. Uncle Shui, are you teaching me how to teach my son? Do you need me to remind you? You are that failed father. It must be the karma. I'll stop talking with you. Son, let's go. Crazy woman. I'll see if you get karma later. Shit! You are so lucky. He loves you so much. Maid. As I was not around, you wanted to hide my late wife's photo again? She has passed away many years go, please leave her alone. She has passed away many years ago, why do you still put her photo there? Hiding her photo is good to you, her, and me. In short, if you touch her photo again, I will ask my son to fire you! Fire me? I suffer a lot while working, I don't want to suffer when I am at home. Mister. What is that to do with me? You released your temper at me? If you like it so much, just keep it for yourself! Whatever, I am going to bath now, have your meal yourself! I don't understand. Your son gave you money for living, why are you still selling ice-cream? What? Pig offal soup again? I want meat ball soup with choy sum! The choy sum is not good today. Not good? My mood is even worse. Besides, I want flat rice noodles in egg gravy! What? Flat rice noodles in egg gravy? You want me to buy it in this hot weather? You're really silly. Here, take your medicine after meal. Why are you wearing like this? Just two of us here. What will Summer think? That's enough! You think I am soft? You are bad as well. You have bad temper and smelly fart. I am the only one who can tolerate you. I am going to resign now! Beg me. Beg you? I can live on my own! Do you think you can? Okay. Tell me. Do you know which medicine to eat first, have how many times per day and pills each time, before or after meal, or two days once? Tell me! Don't worry. I have recorded everything in Walkman. Your Walkman just spoilt yesterday. I think you need to beg me no matter what. I am not going to beg you. Go to hell! I'll give you one more chance. Beg me. Beg me. Beg me. Okay, fine! I can see that you've actually packed everything and been wanting to resign. Goodbye! I don't believe I will die eating all these, they will be excreted eventually. Aunt Ha. Get out of my way! She ran away from home again. I think Aunt Ha is pissed off with Uncle Shui again. She seems really angry as she is almost naked. Nonsense! Let's guess how many days she will be away. I guess it will be 3 days. I guess it will be 5 days. You don't need to guess who I'm. I am Gao Xiu Ping's cousin. I'm helping in the grocery shop temporarily. Hello, I am Luo Si Feng. You are just a worker. Why did you beat me so hard? I will be the banker, you bet 3 days, you bet 5 days. Place your bet. -I don't gamble. -I don't gamble. Seven days. They don't gamble, but I do. Deal, Bao Zhu! Sister Si Feng, do you not have common sense? We are twins! Stupid. Stupid sick man, you won't recover. I'll see how long you can stand. As I'm not around, go help yourself! Aunt, where is Uncle Shui? Don't mention him or else I'll castrate you. How many days will you be staying here? Is it 2 days like last time? I have resigned! I am not going back anymore! I came back to revive sister and brother-in-law's business. Don't always play with your phone and don't know anything! Aunt, you said you had resigned? You will be staying here? I need to look after you? You can see that the business is not good. Otherwise, I won't play with my phone. You play with your phone all the time, it is better you get married with it. You want to piss your late parents off? Aunt, it's not that I don't want to get married. You know it yourself, all the good girls have moved to the city. Otherwise, I won't play with my phone only. I even thought of closing this shop and opening a mobile shop. What? What did you just say? No, I mean... your bad temper must be because of the hot weather. Why don't you go take a bath and drink some "loeng shui" (herbal tea)? If you mention Uncle Shui again, I will slap you then! Little punk! How about "loeng fun" (grass jelly)? Uncle Shui. Aunt Ha asked me to come over to check if your Walkman is fixable. It is on the table, you take it yourself, my legs feel debilitated. What? What have you done? Wait for a while, let me go to the toilet first. What are you thinking? I mistakenly took the medicine, I'm suffering from diarrhoea. Uncle Shui. Your dinner, flat rice noodles in egg gravy, is here. Flat rice noodles in egg gravy? It looks like what I excreted just now, how am I going to eat it? I thought you just went in? Uncle Shui, you are suffering from diarrhoea? Why did you chase Aunt Ha away? Look how you look like now. I'll put it in a bowl, it'll be worse if you've nothing to excrete later. How could you talk without breathing? It came again! Didn't you go to the kitchen? What? You were peeping at me! Stupid old man! I never thought that you have this hobby! If it hadn't been Aunt Ha, I wouldn't have cared about you! Miss! I'm suffering from diarrhoea, how could I peep at you? Uncle Shui, you are really bad, I heard a woman's voice. Hold on, why are you so elusive? I think you chased Aunt Ha away because you wanted to bring her back. There is no such thing. Since we are so close, do you want me to help you get Aunt Ha back? That is not necessary. I can live without her. You don't believe me? Look, everything has been recorded. If you have used up all of the cassettes, what are you going to do? I can delete it and reuse it. It's an old technology. Besides, help me fix my Walkman as soon as possible. What are you talking about? I saw you holding my Walkman and walked out from the back door. Uncle Shui, your sickness is getting more serious. If I were to leave from the back door just now, how could I be standing here now? You are fooling me? Uncle Shui, remember to take your medicine after you finish the noodles. Report! He has bowel movements "jiu" (nine) times today. Isn't that a good sign? "Tian Chang di jiu" (eternal). Are you crazy? You thought marriage? Did Bao Zhu repair his Walkman? She is repairing it now. Are you really not going back? What if he dies in the toilet? That's good then. I'm going to buy vegetables. Wait a minute. Let me know if he's still suffering from diarrhoea these two days. All right, I'm going back to watch the shop. Aunt Ha, I heard that you resigned again. Yes, you have heard about it. Remember to go back after 2 days. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Drinks on me by that time. Little punk, you took me up on a bet again. Aunt Ha, the choy sum looks good today. I'm having mustard greens instead of choy sum today. What? You always buy choy sum, have choy sum. I told you I don't want choy sum! I want to have mustard greens today. All right. Buy mustard greens and free choy sum. I don't want choy sum! Why do you keep forcing me to buy it? Uncle Shui likes to eat choy sum. If he likes it, ask him to come buy it himself. I have special promotion today, free choy sum if you buy any vegetables . I don't want! This choy sum looks really good. The choy sum looks good right? Yes, buy them back for Uncle Shui. I won't buy even it looks good. I want mustard greens. Moreover, you, busybody, do not spread the words. I just bought mustard greens, it doesn't mean I fell in love again. The choy sum looks good this morning, so I bought some for you. Cousin-sister? Fong? Why are you here? You're relatives? What a coincidence. A distant cousin-sister. We have not met each other for ages. How did you know her? Last night I dreamt about Summer wanting to eat sugar cane. I bumped into Sister Fong when buying sugar cane this morning. Yes, what a coincidence. She's going to migrate to Australia and might not come back again. So, she came back to worship ancestors and commemorate here. I will let her stay in for a few days. Stay here? No way! A man and a woman. Fong, come stay in my motor shop. Your motor shop is very dirty, I have skin allergy. Yes, your place is so dirty. Cook a few dishes for Fong. Brother Shui, as you are so kind, I will then stay here for a few days. Don't you think she looks like Summer? It seems spooky. Nonsense! Cook it yourself if you want to eat! Nowadays, maid is so bad-tempered. It's all right, I'm the decision maker here. You can stay here for a few days. Cousin-brother. Director Wong, I can go to Beijing anytime for the negotiation and interview, just let me know when your convenient time is, all right? Thank you. You promised to look after my father and mother, you also said they would be fine after 3 or 4 days. Why is it so long this time? Besides, who is Sister Fong, a relative who suddenly appeared? How would I know why an aunt would visit suddenly? To be honest, your mother is really troublesome. She always makes me work without using phone. Please take her to stay with you. She won't want to leave here. Moreover, I'm going to work in Beijing. You also heard our conversation. If things go well, I will be away for a long time. Then how about your mother? That is why I am back to settle all these troubles. Please bring her with you, don't give me any troubles anymore. How dare you say that? You supposed to settle everything, but you gave me all these troubles. What? Your trouble appeared. Uncle Shui, it's done, let's get going. Don't be like his mother, Aunt Ha. She's so terrible. She spoilt my motorcycle and wanted to blackmail me. Uncle Shui, you said his mother was terrible? Aunt Ha is your mother? Then it's different story. Everyone calls me Uncle Shui. You can call me Handsome Shui. Okay, Handsome Shui. You need one week to repair this? You want me to die from hunger? I need to work. Cousin-brother, please help. Help Handsome Shui to settle it. 2 or 3 days. It's impossible, his motorcycle is too old, many parts of it have spoilt. I don't have spare parts, I've to wait one week to get them. You can just get them from other motorcycle. How could you say that? Do you not know that Handsome Shui is a workaholic? He can't just sit at home doing nothing or else something will happen. All right, I will get it done for you in three days' time. Two days! Two days? You might as well buy a new one. You can do it. You are so smart, you sure can get it done. I can't stand both of you anymore. Fine! I'll get my tools first. Young man, you have a good character. You don't look like your mother, Aunt Ha. Wait a minute. It is terrible if my son looks like you. Let's take a look. Repairing service, towing service, miscellaneous, and deposit. The total is RM 988. RM 988? Isn't it too expensive? It is a good sign. Can it be cheaper for my sake? What about you take it back? Or I'll get a rubbish truck to tow it away, all right? Woman's heart is the most vicious. Moreover, we only accept cash, we don't accept cheque. I'm not afraid of you! I brought cash with me! You're so smart? What? Just let him be. Let him be? 19 times. I ran away 19 times. How could a person not recognise his wife? He thought I'm the maid who was hired by his son. Now that the homewrecker is at home. As his wife, I might lose my place soon. How could I be patient on this? Oh no, I didn't bring my money. It's all right, I'll pay for you first. I'm lazy to talk to both of you. Do you know what I am thinking? What? It's impossible that you are her son. You might be... my illegitimate son. -This… -It's because we can get along easily. Don't you think so? We have the same sense of humour, you will laugh at my jokes. Chipmunk, your gas is here. Leong Gor, when did you come back? Cousin-sister, you are drooling over him. -Handsome man, you're great. -I'm not handsome man, I'm Leong Gor. -Nice to meet you. -Busybody! Go carry another ten barrels of gasoline to the backstreet. I have something to tell you. Cousin-brother, your body is sticky, take a shower first. -All right. -Yes, I help you. Of course you can help him, but it has to be after they enlarge the bathroom. You are too big for the current bathroom. -You... -Do you want money? Stupid Chipmunk! Uncle Shui, if everyone gets three sticks free, it's unfair to you. Do you think I am really that stupid? I'll definitely find out how it works and challenge you! Get back to work now or else I will fire you! Go! Uncle Shui, she wants to challenge you, you will get into trouble. Trouble? It is a trouble to be handsome like me. I have the same feeling. You? What did you laugh? Can't I be handsome too? Cook. Start cooking. This is great. Rice cooker, you are just like me. You will just do whatever someone asks you to do. However, don't worry, I won't let you down. I will not be as bad as that old man. I'm good to you right? The rice and soup which are cooked by this rice cooker... will help you win his heart through his stomach. What are you talking about? I don't get you. Are you talking about the man who sells pork or the waste collector? Mother, I have something to tell you. I will be working in Beijing, I'll not be back for a long period. So, think of a reason to go back tomorrow. If you both can get along again... and take care of each other, I won't be worried then. I'll never go back! Just go to Beijing. When you come back in the future, your mother has become an entrepreneur of pickled choy sum. All right, buy me some salt from the store. All right, I will go buy it later. Actually, I don't know what happened those days. We just went fishing... and dancing for a few times, I then totally fell in love with him. Now that you asked me to change my mind? If I were to change my mind, I would not be called Summer Ha! What are you reading, Handsome Shui? There is an accident, he looks like my son. Your son? He is only 22 years old. He can be your grandson instead. If that is the case, I'm relieved then. You seem to be the same age as my son is. Are you married? I am still single. How could that be? Are you too picky with girls? What type of girl do you prefer? Fat, slim, like this, like this, gentle, or fierce? The types of girl you mentioned are garrulous. I do not like. I prefer someone who is masculine. It's hard to find this type of girl. In short, do not do anything. I'm going to buy something. -Si Feng. -Yes. -Do you have salt? -Of course. You want coarse salt... or fine salt? Is it enough? Not enough? Take the whole carton then. Isn't she masculine? That's enough! I will pee on you if you continue peeping at me! You have a large volume of urine. What is so surprising? Have you seen a woman passing by here? Will I be peeing here if there is a woman passing by? Let's search over there. You asked me out for dinner as a compensation, but you ended up doing dirty thing here, so you are really a jerk! You thought she and I had something? Sister Fong must have something. She insulted me without reason. She should be called slut at her age. In short, she is definitely not an ordinary housewife. We must investigate her. -Yes. -Yes. Report! Uncle Shui didn't work for three days. Oh God. Chipmunk, get to work now! Who hired this stupid person? Your father trusts him even he is a stupid person. Are you the transfer student? Yes. Are primary students now tall and strong? I grew up faster and I'm healthy. In fact, I'm still a kid. Where are the other kids? They have gone to school. I planned to get going after having ice-cream. I will transfer to another school after that. Here, this is free for you, leave you a good memory. Thank you. Try to delay his time and ask for the roulette game. Don't let Uncle Shui leave so soon. Uncle Shui, I want one more and play the roulette game! Do you really like it so much? Yes. Take all of them, leave you better memories. So many of them? They really left me a lot of memories. What is going on? If I were to finish them, my pay would be gone for medicine! Cut the crap, hold on to the last. Oh no! She is here! Brother Shui. I purposely came here to help you sell ice-cream. I made a big sacrifice. Kid, do you want more? Hey beauty, don't talk about ice-cream, let's be friends. Kid, do you have Oedipus complex? She is not for me, she's for my single father. I know I am pretty and attractive, but kid, I am sorry, I've had a crush on someone. Uncle Shui, you are lucky to have such a beauty to help you. You both are really a doomed couple! You and me. This is ridiculous. Get out from here! It smells so good! This is so disgusting! Do not fart in front of me, I feel like vomiting! I have been like this all the time. That's true too. However, I could cook your favourite pork ball soup with choy sum for you, you can also fart at somewhere else for me right? Of course. All right, have it when it's still hot. It's just nice. -Is it nice? -There is room for improvement. Room for improvement? Don't be so fussy. Didn't you feel the taste of love in the food? The advertisement is over. Get out from here! Please don't, honey! You are such a gambler. I will end the relationship with you... after paying off your debts, get out from here! Your mother has Alzheimer's disease! You never took good care of this family! You gambled all the time, you have ruined this family! Get out from here! What should I do so that you will forgive me? Please calm down. You want me to cut my fingers off? Go ahead! What a gambler! Right? Yes. Do you know that... I am the first person who met Sister Fong? Here you go. Uncle Shui, did you make a mistake? It's just toilet paper, why did you give me one thousand bucks? It will be a problem to give you back the change. You can deduct it for my future purchases. Uncle Shui, you son gave you so much money, can you spend it wisely? I also don't know why the toilet paper ran out so fast. Perhaps the maid sold them? I mean Aunt Ha. I'm pissed off when talking about her! Don't get pissed off. Few days later, I found out she was gambling next door! She thought I couldn't recognise her... as she covered herself up. When I saw her earrings, I am very sure that she is Sister Fong! So, can I join you all? All right, you can join us, but I want to find the evidence to expose Sister Fong. I want to let Handsome Shui clearly see her true colour! No problem! Leave it here. Me? The dried meat! Shui, you took Fong here to drink with us after work. Are you going to tell us you want to marry a second wife like what I did? Uncle Shui, I have something good for you. You don't need to worry about inability at your age... and being disliked by your pretty wife as you can't satisfy her. You should learn from him, buy this Hari-Harimau Tongkat Ali from me. It'll settle everything. -Is this yours? -Yes. Thank you, do you want to join us? I don't know how to play mahjong. -I won! -What? Four step sequences, 32 points. You won when I was not around! -Money. -Pay me. Is it so powerful? Lasting, anti-impotence, health care. I have never had this fantasy for a long time. Fong and I are still normal friends. Stop playing your phone at this time! 9 characters, pong! Nine gates, 88 points, I won! Pay me. I'll leave first. Fong. What are you doing there? It is very hot there, here is much cooler. Obscene! Where are my reading glasses? Where are they? Take 3 pills each time. Magical Tongkat Ali, please create miracles. It will double the power... and speed if I take double dose? Stupid fellow sold me fake medicine. There is no effect after so long. It's coming. A downflow of warm air. Brother Shui, why are you standing there? You didn't hear it right? What sound is it? Sound? A distant firecracker sound. I am planning to sell off my ice-cream motorcycle, retire and live with you the rest of my life, is it okay? Really? Let you know first, I am not an easy girl, I have to see your sincerity. Where is he? What's wrong with you? Why is your fart so smelly? What is so surprising? Fart is smelly! What are you doing here? Leong Gor asked us to inform you that... he wants to go fishing with you tomorrow. Fishing. -Fishing. -Fishing? I am looking for sparrow. Hawk. Eagle. I thought you would come alone. You too. What? I brought a mermaid, but you brought a pufferfish. You said Si Feng is a pufferfish? You are so bad. Uncle Shui, this place is very hot. I thought you would bring me to eat Teochew steamed fish? If we catch it. Are you bored? You are even sweating. Let's go for a walk. What? Let's go for a walk. Okay. Have good chat and do whatever you want to do. To be frank, why did you invite me to come fishing? Your son invited me. I brought Si Feng along because I want to be a matchmaker. Furthermore, you too. Look for a partner for the rest of your life and don't be alone. It's really miserable. Thank you for your concern. Hello, Sister Fong. Yes, where are you? Don't be afraid, it is very safe here. Yes, you can place your bet as big as you wish. Come, place your bet. It must be Crab this time, I will bet on it. Sister Fong, Fish, Prawn and Crab, which one do you want? Aren't you afraid of police as you are gambling here? There is nothing to be afraid of, we have been living here for ages, police will not come at this time. Come, place your bet. I don't know how to gamble. It is very easy to choose a picture. It's fine, I will watch you all gambling. My hand is itchy again, I want to place a bigger bet. I'll bet all my money on Crab! Sister Fong, go! Zhen Zhu, you think I'll be scared of your large amount of money? Sister Fong, I am happy today, bet RM 1 get RM 10. Bet RM 1 get RM 10? If that's the case, I will bet on Fish. Sister Fong, you are great. I'm going to reveal the result. One, two, three! -Everyone, freeze! -Freeze! We got a call saying that there are people illegal gambling here! Illegal gambling! You're suspected of gambling here, stand still! Stand still! Two of you, follow me to the police station. Mr Policeman, there is an accomplice behind there. What? I didn't gamble. You gambled too. Me? This is just a tissue paper. Tissue paper? Can I use your dressing table? Open your mouth. It's done. You made me look like this, you have to bear the responsibility. Take a look first. How is it? -It looks nice. -Of course. Why are you so familiar with all these cosmetics? Are you... I am in the advertising industry. I have to try out any products that I get, so that I can make good advertisements. However, don't tell me that you like how I look now. Actually, I still enjoy being single. I see, you should have told me earlier. I then didn't have to entertain Uncle Shui for so long. I'm not used to be gentlewoman, I'm more comfortable like this. Since we are so honest, let's be ourselves. Do you think it is easy to be yourself? If I had been being myself, I wouldn't have run away from home and stay with my cousin-sister. You all are family members, anything can be discussed. Let me ask you, how about the case of your family? My phone is ringing, let me answer first. You are here again? Come out. Why? You're reluctant to let him go? What? I just brought back the repaired Walkman. You brought Walkman or food? Buy 1 get 1 free? Just like supermarket doing promotions everyday? Brother Shui chose me instead of you and chased you away. Are you begging for sympathy now? Take all these away! I have met a lot of bad people, but I have never met someone as bad as you! Who do you think you are? I am his wife no matter how. He just can't recognise me due to the illness. Get over yourself! Everyone knows your intention! If you are smart enough, get out of here. Otherwise, I will have my way to chase you away, jerk! Maid, what are you doing here? Brother Shui. Look at the dishes I cooked for you. Don't you think you have gone too far treating Fong like this? You can't do this due to jealousy. Stupid old man, wake up, you don't even know who she is! I am wide awake. I will open a joint bank account with her later, so that she will be carefree the rest of her life. I also want to let the whole village know that I wholeheartedly love her. Just like how I love Summer. All right, I'll go! Madam, why are you practising calligraphy here? That stupid old man said that he wanted to marry that homewrecker! That serious? Then why are you still here? You planned to write 'endure' to calm yourself? Calm? How could I calm myself? They got to know each other not long ago, he then talked about marriage. I have been living with him for half of my life. Now that he chased me away. Tell me, how could I calm myself? Why don't you use marker pen instead? Did you secretly go back just now? I didn't. I just passed by coincidently. I won't care about him anymore. I want to hire a foreman and take care of this motor shop. I will take care of myself, how free it is. How to write the character 'pin'? You want to ignore me too? Read the newspaper, you should find the character. You're crazy asking me to read the newspaper. Don't forget your intention, persist until the end. Persist? How could I persist? He wants to open a joint bank account with her and give her all the money! -Open a joint bank account? -Yes. Where are you going? Bad son. 'Zhao pin' (recruitment). 'The leader of pyramid scheme absconded with RM 30,000.' Brother Shui, hurry up, it is almost 4 o'clock, the bank is going to close. -I found my identification card. -Let's go. Uncle Shui, we have something to discuss with you. Sit down. This flat rice noodle with egg gravy is delicious, you have to try it, I purposely bought it for you. I am going to the bank to open a joint bank account with Fong. -What? -What? Bank? It's crowded now. Joint bank account application has a lot of procedures. Let's have the noodle first -Get a bowl. -Get a bowl. Everyone, thank you very much. I have brought along glutinous rice chicken. It can keep us full, right? Brother Shui, let's go, the bank is going to close. Have you brought the banking book? -Banking book? -Yes. Oh God, I've forgotten where I put it. -That's good. -It's fine, just sit down. It is okay, I have recorded the account number in Walkman. -What? -Let's go. Uncle Shui, both of you can't get married, you have to listen to me! He will not believe even if you tell him about it. What is it about? You can't say it, it involves life. Since we're dead now, I have to try it then! -Uncle Shui... -Zhen Zhu! Dirty! Bastard! Stupid Chipmunk! Do you know that the first kiss is very important for a girl? Really? You got my first kiss yesterday. Really? You got Zhen Zhu's first kiss today! I know now, you want to get Sister Fong's first kiss tomorrow right? What are you all doing? Sisters! Let's deal with this bad guy! -Blood! -Blood! Hurry up! Help! Blood! -It hurts. -His head is bleeding. Handsome Shui, please send him to the hospital. -Yes. -Yes. Otherwise, no one can help him. It's bad if his brain is affected, we will take care of Sister Fong. Kids, do not play on the street, it is very dangerous! Where are your parents? Why are you shooting me? Stop it! Chipmunk, stop it, you have to go to the hospital as you are bleeding. Chilli sauce? Was it nice? Yes, honestly, I purposely want to cheat that old man out of his money. Otherwise, you thought I like his handsome look? He is the one who is willing to give me all his money. Are you all jealous? What consequence will there be if he overhears what you said? You are despicable, you recorded what I said? You are more despicable! You are dead! You deserve it! I... Why is it 4 zeros? Did you start the recording? I didn't start it. What are you all doing? -Handsome Shui, she... -Brother Shui. They were scolding me. They said I cheated you out of your money. I don't know what I have done wrong. Crazy woman, you're really good at acting! Uncle Shui, no, she wanted to open a joint bank account with you because... -she wants to get your money. -Hold on! It is my intention to open a joint bank account with her! She never cheated on me or forced me! Yes, I don't want anything and never want your money, Brother Shui. In short, she cheated you out of your money and said you were stupid. Stupid old man! I am old man anyway. In conclusion, I clearly know who treats me good! Old man, you are being blinded. You still think you're smart even you're being cheated on. Sister Fong, you became beautiful after changing hairstyle. I nearly couldn't recognise you. She is a famous person in our village. She is the leader of pyramid scheme. However, she suddenly went missing last week! She took all our hard earned money and ran away. You don't believe? Read the newspaper yourself! You think with these two persons and this fake newspaper, I will believe you? This whole case is your conspiracy. You want to separate Fong and I. You think I have nothing to do? Look yourself. They are not the temporary actors that I hired. Their leader ran away and they came here to collect debt! They are the real victims! No, it's not like that. I have no intention to cheat on you. I had bad luck and I lost all my money gambling. I was forced to run away. I don't have the intention to cheat on you, please forgive me. Brother Shui, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Brother Shui, please forgive me. -What is happening here? -The truth is disclosed! Shui. Shui. I'm not able to drink with you these few days. I am going on honeymoon with May. I'll contact you once I'm back. How great you are! This is nonsense! I will book a flight ticket and attend the 2nd interview on time. Thank you, Mr Huang. Handsome Shui. I should have a partner as I'm old. In order to avoid the van that time, my car crashed into drain. Summer then passed away. It is my fate. You all young people should get married as soon as possible, so that you have a partner. You are like this, Chipmunk is also like this. What? Why did you call him Chipmunk? He looks like chipmunk. He has a name, he is called Cheung Mun Yok. -Okay, Maggie Cheung. -He is not Maggie Cheung. -Maggie Cheung! -Shut up, don't call him Chipmunk. Why did you release your anger on me? You might have Alzheimer's disease earlier. That's nothing to do with this. Did you contact your bad father? Bear in mind! You chased me out of this house! Zi Kin, let's go! I am sorry, my bad. It should be your late father instead of bad father. I'm sorry to mention your sad moments. I might not be a good father as well. Can I borrow your phone? Sure. Si Feng gave my phone to Bao Zhu to get it repaired, I haven't called my son for a long time. Where are the numbers? Here, you can call now. It couldn't connect again. Did I call the wrong number? Why couldn't it go through all the time? Are you dreaming? Drink the soup, it's your favourite meat ball soup with choy sum, Drink it while it is still hot. How? Is it not nice? Where did you buy it? It tastes so familiar. There is a feeling. It's a feeling of happiness. Do you want to know the reason? Fook. Leong Gor. Has everything done? -Yes. -Okay. -I will hand this place over to you. -Okay, thank you. I was conned again. Follow what I do later. -Okay. -Music. Why you are not dancing? What are you doing? Why did you touch me? You want to go after me? No, I'm here to accompany your son going after her. Accompany him going after her? Stupid. You, that's enough, stop dancing, you look like a robot. You too. Look at how I dance. Change music. Follow me. Again? 1, 2, 3, 4. 2, 2, 3, 4. I didn't expect that you are still so good at dancing at your age. You are so feminine. You feel I am feminine? You want to go after me? Does collecting debts count? No matter collecting debts or going after, I'm fine with anything, but you have to promise me one thing. Tell me the secret of the roulette on your ice-cream motorcycle. No way, that is the secret between Summer and I. Why can't you tell me? What is the difference between she and I? Take a look of yourself in the mirror. Stupid. That's fine. Aunt Ha, why are you dancing so far away? Didn't you notice I am going back while dancing? Why are you smiling like that? I am in a relationship. The newspapers are free today, just take them. I'll take them then. Yes, they are free. -Okay, thank you. -Take more. Do you want me to kiss you? That's fine. Pay me, your phone is fixed. Zhen Zhu, I don't have small change. I am Bao Zhu. Don't worry, I have small change. If you don't pay, I will add interest on it! Uncle Shui, why are you farting here? You smell it? You are so temperamental. You said it was free just now, but now you wanted to add interest? You should pay me for that. You think everyone is like Aunt Ha? She pays everything for you and tolerates your fart. You never appreciate her and take her for granted. -You should think about it properly. -You should think about it properly. The secret of roulette. Did I record it? 'The secret of roulette.' Roulette not only brings joy to kids, but it also brings joy to adults. My most memorable moment is... it let me get to know Summer. With this small trick, I could make her happy. She would smile until I couldn't see her eyes. She has the perfect smile as compared to anyone. Why would I talk about this? Actually, what I want to talk about... is the secret of winning... three sticks of ice-cream. It is... Why is there no sound? Oh no. What a lousy thing! Never mind, we can disassemble the roulette. What? Disassembling the roulette is her idea. What now? It has nothing to do with me. Luckily I am good at playing phone. What? I said I was good at playing phone, take a look. Strictly speaking, he is our target. Me? Another way to go after Aunt Ha is to turn Uncle Shui into a superb man. According to Facebook, there are 5 important criteria to be superb man. First, a superb man can't be too handsome, so that the woman will feel secure. Mother, why are you taking so long in the shower? Can't you wait for a moment? It has been two hours. -Make it next time then. -No, hold on, it'll be done soon. She is here. Second, a superb man has to be kind. If it's a small mistake, you should forgive your partner and just smile. Third, a good man has to be gentle, let her feel that you care about her. Hold her hand if you ask her out for meal. Let her sit first after reaching the restaurant. Let her read through the menu first. Fourth, a superb man should spend on what is necessary. If she has been staring at a dish on the menu for a long time, it represents that she feels like having it. You have to order for her before she ordering it. Waiter. I want to order the dish this lady pointing at, make it two. Sure. It tastes good, but I feel like it somehow lacks something. Your son said... to be a superb man, fifth, I should know how to cook. So, I'll cook Summer's and my favourite food for you. Really? Thank you. Summer's best dishes. When Summer was cooking, there was a special taste. I call it the taste of happiness. It's because she knew that I am used to my mother's Hakka dishes. Therefore, when she was cooking, she would add in nightshade. Once she added it, no matter frying egg or cooking soup, there would be the taste of happiness. Nightshade? Which of you is vegetable seller? Do you have nightshade? Uncle Shui, I'm the vegetable seller. Your presbyopia is getting worse. You are vegetable seller? I'm looking for nightshade. Nightshade? What's that? Does it strengthen the body? Did Hari-Harimau Tongkat Ali I sold you last time not work? Uncle Shui, helping people is our responsibility as a police officer. Is your nightshade being kidnapped or missing? Let us know the features of nightshade, we will step up patrols and let you know once we find it. The police officers now are so responsible? You even have time to look for a vegetable? I think I can find it faster than you. It's a waste you being a police officer. Fatty, do you have nightshade? Nightshade? It sounds like a weight losing tea. It's not good. You should do exercise like me if you want to get slim, it's the best way. I never heard of nightshade before. Can you help me to get up? I am not free. Help me, it's just a small favour. Sir, can you please help me? Mister, can you please help me? I'm sorry, uncle, I can't help you. Uncle Shui? -You know me? -Yes. Do you know where I'm staying? Yes, I do. I don't know the way home, can you take me home? Let me take you home. Uncle Shui, give me all your money! Shui. Shui. Where is he? Shui. Where are you? Why is there smoke? What is burnt? Shui. Shui. Shui. Handsome Shui, where are you? Handsome Shui. Handsome Shui. Where are you exactly? Handsome Shui. It is me. Why are you here? I should have asked you. Do you know that I have been looking for you? I don't remember the way home. I was robbed, he took all my money. Money is not important as long as you are safe. I'm totally lost. Will I do the same thing in the future? Do I have Alzheimer's disease? It's impossible you have Alzheimer's disease. You are so handsome, aren't you? That's true too. I was so scared just now. How did you hurt yourself? Just now while I was looking for you, there was a car coming, I tried to avoid it, I then fell down. It is okay, I will dress your wound for you after we get home. You? Maid, all these years, I've been releasing my anger on you... and Fong's case, but you never dislike me. Perhaps you take care of me? Take care of your health? I mean taking care of me the rest of my life. Do you mind to be the substitute of Summer? I am old, I don't mind at all. Is that a promise? What do you mean? -Marry me. -What? Do you need to react like that? You know the way home right? -Yes. -Let's go. This way. I think this is the box. Marriage is an important thing, I nearly forgot to tell my son. I thought you record everything in your walkman? Why did you write a note this time? Walkman will spoil, but note will not. Since your memory is not good, you might lose your note as well. I will stick it like this. Hello, mother. You finally answered the call. Is there anything? When are you coming back? Soon, 2 more days. I will bank in the money to you tomorrow. It's not about the money, Your father and I almost got hit by a van. What? Luckily your father had good reflection, we just fell into a drain. Are you both okay? We are okay, we only have minor injuries. Your father is worse, he got frightened. Do you want to talk to your father? It is not necessary since you both are fine. I am going to attend a meeting, talk to you later. -Okay, goodbye. -Hey! It couldn't go through again. Your son is so capable, he must be busy working, that's why he didn't answer your call. You are right, you should be like him. He earns a lot of money and he is a filial son. Once I fell sick, he straightaway hired a maid to take care of me. This is the wedding ring. Summer loved it so much during those times. Here will cut the finger. I remember it. It cut Summer's finger that time. I should take it to fix, but I didn't remember where I kept it. Do you want to let my mother wear it? Do you think she will love it? Definitely. It's the time for the bride and the groom to exchange rings. This ring belonged to Summer, do you mind? I don't mind. Come on. You are smiling and crying at the same time, do you really love me that much? Stupid. Come. Let's take a photo with the new couple. Ready, 1, 2, 3. It is our turn. Ready, 1, 2, 3. Come, let's see if it is nice. Let's have consummation, okay? All right. Aren't you going to the airport? Yes, I will be in Beijing at this time tomorrow. When will you be back? I think I will not be back again. So, don't make my mother angry again. Of course I will not, she is my wife now. I will tolerate her. I don't have to hold my fart anymore. Here, you keep it. The cassette contains my promise to your mother. If I don't treat your mother well in the future, you can take revenge on me. This is what you promised. What a coincidence, where are you going? I'm going back home. Thank you. What is that for? For making you feminine? Of course not, I'm serious. I learnt something from you, no matter what problems a family has, they can be solved. It's because of my parents, I was forced to come back. However, I am curious, what happened between you and Uncle Shui in the past, you then pissed off and never came back? I don't remember. In short, after that argument, I seldom came back for many years. It seems like you are very stubborn. However, it is good to forget the bad memories. In short, thank you very much. My bus is here, I should go now. Bye. Let go of things and don't be too stubborn... or else you will suffer from haemorrhage. Si Feng, keep in touch, do let me know if you come back. I am not sure when I will be back. We'll see how it goes, goodbye. Goodbye. Mr Leong, a friendly reminder. Please be punctual for the 2nd interview the day after tomorrow. I, Leong Shui, promise you, the son of Aunt Ha, I can forget anything, but I won't forget to treat your mother well... Son, I am not sure if you will hear this, but the doctor told me today that... my Alzheimer's disease... is getting worse. I will forget something everyday. so I am not sure when I will forget everything. After selling ice-cream today, I lost my way home. I am... so worried about your mother. My illness will get worse in the future, I don't know how she will handle it, but I know that she will persist. No matter how, she will continuously cook my favourite food for me. Meat ball soup with choy sum is ready. There is nightshade that I planted in the meat balls. You have to remember this taste after having it, okay? Remember the nightshade. Remember Summer who has changed. Have your meal, stupid, come. I feel sorry for you. In my whole life, there are 2 things that I don't know how to control. The first thing is farting. Did you just fart again? Luckily I can tolerate it. Second, I released my anger on you and chased you away that day. One day, if you come back... and realise that I can't recognise you, I hope you can tell me. If you live a happy life, I feel relieved then. Bad son, is what everyone talking about true? You have ruined my reputation! Whether that it's true or not, you only concern about your dignity! Bear in mind! You chased me away from this home! -Zi Kin, let's go! -Just go away if you want! After I chased you away, I remember the neighbours laughed at me. They said I chased my own son away. I'm not able to tell you the regret I feel. It's actually easy to chase you away, but now I know it's impossible... to get you back. In the end, there is only one thing that is still accompanying me... which is the old broken ice-cream motorcycle. I am not sure when I will forget you and your mother. As for now, if someone asks me, "what is your... biggest dream?" I wish I would never forget you and your mother. Remember, nightshade. This is nightshade. Hello. Father, it's me. It's me? Who is this? I am your son. Your son? You are my son? Yes. Father. Is it true? Why couldn't my call go through these few years? How are you now? Are you all right? I have changed my phone number, I am fine. Hold on, don't hang up first. I will get a paper and write down your phone number. Hello? Son? Son, give me your phone number. Hello? Son, what is your phone number? Hello? Son? -What is your phone number? -0... -Yes, 0... 1... 8... -1... 8... I can't hear you, hold on. Broken phone! Hello? Can you hear me? You might be my illegitimate son. What type of girl do you like? Fat, Slim, like this, or like that? It couldn't go through again. Did I key in the wrong phone number? It's good if you are like him. He earns a lot of money and have filial piety. I might not be a good father. 2... 2... 'Two years later.' You are great! Mom, I got 2 sticks free! That's great. Since you are so great, I will give you 2 flavours. He didn't even change clothes after school and wanted to come here. He said he missed Uncle Shui's ice-cream. Of course, our ice-cream is a lot better. Luckily you are still here selling. Look at him, he is still like a primary student even he is older now. Oh yes, doesn't he need to attend tuition class? Today is Chinese New Year's Eve, Aunt Ha. I want to be a good mother too. Oh yes. Maid. You think I can't see you from far? You keep on chatting and not working. I have sharp ears! Excuse me. Yes, I know you are smart, but it is not sharp ears, it is sharp eyes. I need to get to work now. I'm sorry for that, goodbye. Mother. -You are back? -Yes. Greet your father. Father. I am your son, Leong Gor. What is that? I will pack everything now... and go back to cook the reunion dinner. Can we join? You all want to join? It's not a big deal, I just need to add extra chopsticks! Beauty, come. Let's play the roulette. Come. If you can win 3 sticks, you will get married next year! That's great! I won 3 sticks! This is my first time! However, why? I've been thinking about it for 2 years, but I got no clues. Do you all know the reason? It's a secret! Hold on, I want to get married too! Tell me, what did you do on the roulette? It's a secret. Stupid! If you don't tell me, I will throw this sugar cane on you. Agree to marry me first. Okay. You are so eager to marry me. Stupid, watch out! Don't worry, I will always remember you, Summer! -Hurry up! -Don't go! Stupid!
