Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [alarm rings] What can we do if the rubber milk is depleting? That's due to the rain. We'll check for the brown bast once the rains are over. Or else, the bark will be discoloured. What can be worse than this? [whistles] Poulose, Anikkuttan has lost his cool again. Anikkutta, it's us! Switch off the torchlight. Don't wake up Shanthamma. If you've come to tap rubber, stop whistling around and finish your job! My mother won't hear the whistle or what, Poulose? Oh! What do we gain from this, man? We come here to tap rubber, for your mother's sake. This farm is mine as well. If there's no income, you don't have to do it! The boy is upset. Leave it, Poulose. Anikkutta, I'm not cursing you, only out of my respect for Rachettan. Your farm! Your rubber! I am leaving! As if his plantation is overflowing with rubber! Will anyone start a fight for something so trivial, Anikkutta? He whistled to wake me up when I fell asleep. Isn't he as old as your father? So? Can I make him my father? Those who don't respect me, needn't work here. I'm also working early in the morning. Y'all remember Anikkuttan only when lightning strikes! I'm repairing his daughter's computer. It's not as easy as tapping rubber. Eyes and mind should work in co-ordination. Would you ever understand all that? Whistling early in the morning! [thunder] A couple of sheets have to be replaced. Can you hear me? Huh? How long can we wait for the rains to stop? Tomorrow... You come here tomorrow. Okay, then. Come on! You never eat all the grass that's lying here. I tied this up so that you don't get wet, and you're biting it off? Ruined everything! Come with me. Come on! Come on. I'll hold her. MALAYANKUNJU [baby crying] Don't cry, dear. - Are you crying? - Just give me a moment. Are you venting the anger towards my father, upon me? What's wrong with it? Turn it on and see if it's working. Wait. The charge... It must have run out of charge. Try now. But how will I go to class with this? It's hideous! Can't you get it back to normal? I'll have to order parts. That will cost a lot of money. Tell me an estimate. How much will it cost? Shiny, your dad gave me Rs. 200. This is all I can do with that. I haven't even asked for my service charge. The parts alone will cost at least Rs. 3000. What's wrong with it now? It's working, right? You'll be keeping it open while using it, right? You can't afford to think of the embarrassment, Shiny. I don't want it like this, Anichetta. Keep this here and order the parts. I'll come and take it when I have the money. Get lost. I don't accept gold. And you want your dad to come here cursing me? Bring the money. I'll repair it then. Take this as well. Didn't I say that I don't need it like this? Let me see if I can make some money. Dig a pit and burn it somewhere else, Anikutta. None of the plants are growing there now. That's not due to this, Mom. It's because of the smoke from the stove. Ammini Chechi's son will come to take the TV. Just open the room for him. He will take it and leave. You'll have food before you leave, right? There's no fish, right? There's dried fish. Shall I fry it? No, Mom. I'll eat from outside. Drop this at Suni's house then. Viji has delivered a baby girl. Go, see the baby too. Oh my God! I'll give it myself! Now don't stop eating from here because of this. Hey Jeevan! Bring the gravy. -For you? -One Parotta. -Just one? -Yeah. It slipped. Brother, some gravy please. The bowl fell down. What all did you have? Two Dosas and one cup of tea. Chetta! - Clear the leaf you ate from. - Huh? Clear the leaf you ate from. Oops. I forgot about it. [football game in progress] Pass it! Hey! Give us the ball. Kiddo, give us the ball. - Hey! - Give it back! Hey! What are you doing? Give it to me! Anikutta! These two are my sons! We've shifted here, just in case. Can't say when there will be a landslide, right? And yeah... Tell your mother that the tapping won't be affected because I'm here. Okay, okay! Sumesh, go forward! Go! See, all this is damaged in the same way. How many times do I have to tell you... to disconnect the cables as soon as thunder begins? Anikutta... Even if it's not so clear, can we watch the news tomorrow? Tell me. Screaming all the time! Is it sick or what? It's crying for milk. It's a good omen to hear babies crying in the neighbourhood, Anikutta. Baby Chechi, only half of it was damaged. If you use it carefully, you can use it till next monsoon. You can change it after that, right? Let me ask Kochumon then. If so, you needn't take the trouble of repairing it, right? -Viji! -Yes! Why is the child crying non-stop? -She has been crying for a while now. -Don't know why, Aunty. [radio news] Heavy rains continue in Southern and Central Kerala. Red alert might be declared in Ernakulam, Idukki and Thrissur districts. Heavy rains are expected to continue till Tuesday. Orange alert will continue in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Alappuzha and Kasargode districts. The Government has declared orange alert in six districts, and yellow alert in eight districts, for tomorrow. Taking the possibility of extreme rainfall into consideration, arrangements have been made in all districts, similar to red alert. In Pathanamthitta district... [baby crying] [baby crying] [baby crying] What is this, Anichetta? Pointing the torchlight at the baby? I have to work here! She has been screaming since morning! Give something and stop it. I just gave birth to her yesterday. My daughter isn't old enough to identify who's around. [Man of the house found hanging dead] Only my dad fought with you, right? Do you have a problem with me working here? What happened to this, Mom? It was working fine till yesterday, right? I can manage with that, Anikutta. Now don't lose your focus trying to repair that as well. Babies will cry. That's all they know. Even you and your sisters grew up crying like this. None of these people came to pick fights with me or your father then. I get angry if I lose focus while working, Mom. Hey! It's the monsoon season. It's raining heavily. There's thunder and lightning too. Moreover, the goats, cows and chicken are all crying. And your only issue is that Viji's baby is crying? Forget it, Mom. Give me some tea. It's on the stove. Let me give some food to the workers. That's enough. Come and have some food. Come, Maniyan! If you had taken any longer, I'd have come inside to take it. I'm starving. Come! Eat it, man. There's enough dough for Dosa. They've started a kitchen at the school. They have quotas for each person. They will shout at me if they know that I ate from here. What will happen if you have two Dosas from here, Maniyan? Aunty, give my wage to Anichettan. I'll spend it if it is with me. If I pay whatever I earn as instalments, I might get my computer earlier, right? You keep this then. And do the needful. Lenovo... G 560. G? G 560. Anichetta! - The model is 20040... - Two packets of RC cables and RC pins, three speakers and one wire roll. How much does this torchlight cost? Which one? That's 310 Rupees. It has both high and low beams. It's waterproof too. It's Chinese, but it's a good product. - Add this too. - Okay. Anikutta, is that all? Shall we leave? For the kind attention of the Mulavumpara Panchayat residents, this is a warning issued by the village officer. Since there are chances of heavy rainfall, residents of Kizhakkancheruvu and Tharakkunnu areas... should shift to the temporary relief camp at Mulavumpara LP school. Consider this as an emergency warning. Are you people going this time? I'm not going anywhere. Do they know how troublesome it was last time? Everyone was cooking at the same place, and there was no place even to take a shit. It was two weeks of hell! I'll going to lock my shop and leave after this. Let if get flooded if it has to. What else can I do? They are just creating panic for no reason, Sumesh. They just want to make everyone stay under the same roof, for their own publicity. I can arrange a Jeep or something. No. We're good. We'd rather walk. Fine, fine! Okay, then! Seems like it's a good time, huh? Otherwise why will you be called, Anikutta? We have to keep them scared, right? They will just wander away otherwise. Hey Sumesh! Nothing for me? Here you go. Hey! Make it real tight! Stop. Shall we test it? No. It's not time yet. Don't put me in trouble. Let's go to the room. We'll switch it on from there. Sir, all of them are going back to their rooms. Shall we switch it on? Calm down, Anil. Let it get dark. Have another drink. I have to leave, sir. My mom is alone at home. You check it and let me know if there's any issue. Come, dude. We'll test it for five minutes and get going, Achaya. Starts with crickets! The right side is proper now, right Anil? It is, sir. And then it will pan to the left like this. Now you can hear the elephant's sound. Heard that? The elephants are not as energetic as they used to be, Anil. For the past six years, people have been hearing the same elephant and tiger here. Regular customers will figure it out. At least change the CD, sir. Stop it, Anil. Those who go to see the Makaravilakku at Sabarimala every year, are seeing the flame that the electricity board ignites, right? And they continue to go there, right? An aural pleasure. That's all. Moreover, since there are such sounds, no one will step out to see the forest at night. But where are the forests now? People like you have cleared all of them, right? That's right. Where are the forests now? That's right! My dear! - What are you doing? - I am playing. Are you playing? - Did you have food? - Yes. - You did? - Yes. Where's your father? Dad has gone to sleep. - Did he go to bed? - Yes. - So soon? - Mom! Brother has finished dinner. You go to bed then. If there's any change in the dates, let me know. - Okay. Sandhya is coming to Deepu's house, next Sunday. She's unable to manage the child on her own. She is coming to take Rema along with her. When they come, if you take me to the town, I'll go with her in the car. Where? To Kottayam? No! To Deepu's house. They will drop me back here in the evening. You want met to drop you at that Malayan's (*tribal community) house? If she can't manage the child on her own, you can go to Kottayam with her. I'll set fire to the goats, cows and chicken here along with the rubber, sell this house and go somewhere. Which one is today's? The one on the stove. It will be really hot. [baby crying] Let's sit here. Sit down, Anikutta. Shoot, man! It ran away! What the hell did you do? Reload it quickly! Look! It's running away! It hasn't gone yet. Reload it quickly! Come on! It's coming again. It's near the tree. Look, look! Look! Over there! It has fallen down. Come on. Anikutta! Should I hold the battery? Walk carefully. Rachetta, there's a ditch here. Slowly. There's a ditch somewhere. Poulose, this will be a police case. It has given birth recently. Its children will be around here somewhere. Only we know what we're going through. It was ruining everything that we were cultivating. Don't worry. We'll handle it if any case is charged. We'll be in trouble. I said what I had to say. Anikutta! Keep the battery here and go home. Ask mom to keep some boiling water ready. Go! [baby crying] [devotional song plays] [devotional song gets louder] Bring it forward. - Which one is without sugar? - This one. Have it. We need to stop his habit of sleeping at 5 o'clock. What is this? He doesn't do it often. And since he's busy with work, I don't tell him anything. Did he have lunch? Here you go, son. Haven't you left, Uncle Sura? It's getting dark. You were sleeping, right? Who else will drop me at the junction? Let me go have a bath. - Will they take forever to finish this? - No. They will finish it by tomorrow. He is fine. You're getting anxious for no reason, Shanthechi. That's because you brought the workers. If I had called a couple of people from the colony for this work, he wouldn't have even touched the snack that he ate now. If you take the straight road, it won't take so long, Anikutta. That road is full of potholes. Though this is longer, we can travel by a good road. Are you still holding on to all that? What does Sandhya lack now? And he has got a Government job now, right? He didn't get it on merit, right? Jobs they get through reservation don't have any value, Uncle. Stop the bike. Don't you want to go home? I'll take the late night bus. Park the bike and come with me. I have called them. - They will come. - Two night brews. They are good people. Just what we were missing! Shall I confront him? Forget it, Chetta. Don't say anything. - He has been messing with us for a while. - Let it be. One more bottle, brother. - Do you want tapioca? - No. Is this the night brew? The early morning brew can't be kept here till this hour. What's wrong with it? It's fully diluted with water. Anikuttan might need something stronger. Don't get drunk and play music at dawn to irritate people! What's your problem if I play music in my property? There's a baby in our house, Anichetta. Why are you torturing us? Your baby is screaming into my ears! But his issue is not the baby! No, it's not. Such Pulayans (*casteist slur) needn't enter my house! You bloody.... Suni, stop it. What are you guys doing? Get out of here! - You and your bloody music! - Let go of me, you scoundrel! Write your phone number and sign here. Sign here. It's written that I started the fight, sir. Using casteist slurs is a non-bailable offence. Now it's written that both parties don't have complaints. Sign it and get going. Sign it. Meet the chief before you leave. Jose! Go inside. Are you Anil Kumar? What the f*** is wrong with you? Pointing a torchlight to the neighbour's house and peeping in there? What's your job? Electronics... ... repair work. What do you do? I'm an auto rickshaw driver at Thodupuzha. If you point the torchlight at the baby or insult that family, or do any such nonsense again, I'll charge POCSO and put you behind bars. Got me? I have to work, sir. Where do you want me to go and work? Get lost. Do you have a licence to work from home? Leave it, sir. I'll make him understand. Come on. Step outside for a moment. Sir, please don't make this an issue. His father... My sister's husband... hung himself to death. He has been a little off ever since. Then go and get him treated. Don't trouble the people around. Was there any case against his dead father? No, sir. Rachettan was an innocent man. He was a farmer. Then why did he hang himself? Due to debt? No, sir. His younger daughter... ... eloped with a guy. We can come and take the bike tomorrow. I tried asking for the key. They didn't agree. Come. Come, Anikutta. Let's go in this Jeep. Anikutta, come.

Disconnect that solar panel too. Come on. Water won't rise up till here, sir. But please do it.. for my peace of mind. I need to click a photo and send it. That's why. Anichetta! Anichetta! Anichetta! I will go downstairs. I need to keep an eye on them. Please look at my child, Anichetta! Mom has understood everything. Then why are you behaving like this to me? It was me who saw our father hanging dead. I didn't allow mom to see the body. Had I done that, she'd have considered you dead back then itself.

He behaves differently at different times. Don't mind what he told you. He must be over-thinking. It's not like he doesn't love you. [baby crying] What will I tell the guests, Surendran? Everyone will say that I forced my daughter into this marriage. What will I tell Shantha? Sujith's family must have heard about this, right? Shall I go there and tell them? Isn't that the right thing to do? - Let me go and tell them. - Just come home now, Rachetta. Don't make any hasty decisions. Let me go to the station again with Anikuttan and talk to them. But she has filed a case against me, Surendran! Let me go to Sujith's house. I must tell them myself. Or it will seem like I cheated them. Right? Anichetta. It's awesome. It's as good as new. What happened at the junction yesterday? Did dust get into your eyes? I thought you were an angry young man. Don't take that route again. Why do you have to remind yourself of all those things? Isn't it working now? The display is working fine, right? Don't use it until the battery runs down. Anichetta, you are a very nice man. Stop putting up this 'thug life' attitude, call Sandhya Chechi and all this will be solved. You got your computer, right? It's working now, right? Go home now. I waited here to say this. Take the money from Aunty. I don't want anything for free. Can I come in, Anichetta? Sit down. It's my daughter's naming ceremony tomorrow. We don't have many people to invite here. Your mother said that she'll come. Can you also come, Anichetta? I'll come, Suni. Mom is coming, right? We'll come together. When is it? Between 12 and 12:30 PM. You can have lunch there. Anichetta, have some tea. If it's not happening, leave it, Divakaretta. It's okay if there's no light. Let me try, man. I'll get it done. Guests should see the child properly, right? There has been no power for a while now. Don't think it's coming back any soon, right? We used to do all this when we take this for service. I don't know what's wrong today. Wait. It's connected wrongly. Does the battery have charge? Oh no! That's a bother now. Will it self-start now? Try starting it. Can you get me the tool box? Try now. Come, Suni. Coming! ♪ Fireflies all around, like molten gold ♪ ♪ The sparrows are singing a lullaby for you ♪ ♪ My arms are your swing Sleep, swinging and swaying in them ♪ ♪ Ponni, my child My first born ♪ Ponni...!! Ponni...!! Ponni...!! ♪ Ponni, my child My first born ♪ ♪ My sweet-heart The ray of light in my eye ♪ Anikutta! Don't just stay outside. Go and see the baby. He was really helpful, Shanthechi. I'd have struggled a lot to turn the light on otherwise. Anikutta, let's have lunch here. I haven't cooked anything at home. What happened? What's the problem, Suni? You bought that gold, cheating me and using the money I earned! You know how much half a sovereign of gold costs now? Sandhya's child is 2.5 years old now. How will this fit that child now? It should be of use to someone, right? Keep it in a locker... and sell it when a need arises. That's what everyone does. I'm not magnanimous like you. You won't like all that. Buying some gold for children is not magnanimity. You have invested in chit funds, right? Buy it with that money! I can't bear it when the gold bought with my money, ends up in others' hands. What do you want me to do now? Should I go there and remove that bangle? You should have discussed with me before you gave it. Did you? Shanthechi... What is it, Suni? Anichetta, I don't think the rain is going to stop. And Viji is getting really scared. Divakarettan is about to leave. There's a car here now. Shall we take mom and shift to the camp? She's my mom. Not yours, right? What should we do if your wife is scared? No one is going to the camp from here. Well, Shanthechi told us in the morning.. Ah! You can go wherever you want. I decide things over here. Mom is not coming anywhere. Get going, Suni. Anichetta... - Has the child slept? - She was crying non-stop until now. Sunichettan said we'll leave at dawn. We can't say how the roads will be, at night. I won't be coming, dear. He is really adamant. Take everything that the child needs. Carry some extra bed sheets. You won't be able to wash it there. And figure out something to avoid mosquito bites. I'll call you when we leave, Mom. - Okay then. Go to bed. - Bye. It will be charged by morning. Switch it on once it is fully charged. Mom! Mom! Mom! Son! Anikutta! Son... Wake up! Dad... What happened, Dad? Where are we? Do you need water? Can't you sense a rotten smell of sand? It was a landslide. Our house is now deep under the ground. Where is Mom, Dad? Didn't hear any sound from Shantha. She's well aware of all this. The both of us... We came here together long back, right? She must be up there. She's very sensible. She can predict such things. [baby crying] Whose child is crying? That's Suni's child. Suni got married? That's nice. How old is the child? It was the baby's 28th day ceremony today. Oh no! Poor thing. The baby must be struggling to breathe over there. Get up quickly. She's lying somewhere with no one to save her. Save the baby and take her to her family. They must be really scared. Son! Get up! Anikutta, get up! Come on! Get up. Save her! Anikutta! People are divided by castes, only until they die. Once we are dead, all of us are equal, son. Oye! Oye! Oye! Mom! Mom! Mom, this is Anikuttan! It's me, Mom! Uncle Sura! Poulosetta! Mom! Suni... [baby crying] Ponni? Ponni! Ponni! Don't cry, dear. Ponni! Ponni! Please don't cry, dear. Ponni! Please don't cry, dear. Dear! Please don't cry, Ponni! Ponni... Ponni! [baby stops crying] Ponni? Ponni, dear... Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Mom! Mom! Help! I am down here! I am down here! Help! I am down here! Ponni? Ponni? [baby crying] Ponni! Ponni, dear... Dear... Ponni... Ponni! Don't cry, dear. Ponni! Don't cry, dear. Ponni! Please don't cry, dear! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni? Ponni! I am coming, dear! Please don't cry! Ponni! Don't cry, dear. Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni... Ponni? Ponni? Ponni! Ponni? Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Dear... Ponni!! Ponni! Answer me, dear. Ponni... Ponni! [baby makes noises] Ponni? Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! Ponni! [dog barking] I am here! I am here! I am here! Hello! Hello! Who is it? Can you hear me? I am here. This is Anikuttan! How many of you are there? I'm not alone, sir. I have a baby with me. Are you injured? Is the baby safe? The baby is in my hands. I'm holding her tight. Okay, okay. Don't be scared. Is there anyone else? Hello! Is there anyone else with you? Divakaran Chettan is here. But he's dead. Where is the body? It's deep down under, sir. Any difficulty in breathing, Anikuttan? No, sir. Can you please lift us up? Our mother is up there. Please lift us up, sir. Can you move your limbs properly? Are there wounds? No, sir. Just come. Don't worry. We're coming right away. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Okay! Come to the position. Bring it down. Down! Down! Down! Down! Slowly! Slowly! Sir, is our mother up there? Don't worry. Everyone is safe up there. Don't be scared. Hold on! Anikuttan, we will be going up slowly. Hold the baby tight. -Okay? -Up! Up! Slowly! Up! Bring it down slowly! Make way! Tell me your name, brother. Tell me your name. Anil. Anil Kumar. Can you tell me how you were wounded? A stick pierced in. - How old are you? - Sister... Sister, my mother? Are there any other wounds? My leg... My hands.. Try bending your leg. My mother? I'm giving you a painkiller injection. My mother? Only three people could be rescued alive until now, including a baby who's just one month old. Around sixteen dead bodies have been retrieved so far. The rescue troops have informed that there might be no more people alive here. It's done, brother. Your vitals are all normal. You will be shifted to the hospital now for a detailed check-up, okay? Shift the patient quickly. Are any of Anil Kumar's relatives here? Bring him to the fourth ward once you're done. Your mother was found last night itself. I have informed Bindu and Sandhya. Don't you want to see her? I don't want to. Let's go. I can't stay here. Let's go. [Idukki has faced a huge landslide] [Severe destruction due to the landslide] She is here, Anichetta. The media is creating a frenzy downstairs. Anichetta, the bathroom is free now. Shall I take you there? Sandhya, you stay with the child. I'll take him. I'll go downstairs, Deepu. Don't go alone. I'll come with you. Deepu... I want to try walking on my own. That's why. Keep this phone with you. Call on Sandhya's number if you feel any difficulty. It's alright. Brother.. - Where's the children's ICU? - Downstairs. I can't allow anyone inside. I can't do that without orders from the top. Why are you talking without a conscience? Let the child's condition become stable first. Can't you understand? Don't shout in front of the ICU! What can I do without the permission from higher officials? Please don't crowd around. Please, please... No one should be here, apart from the patient's by-standers. Send that person here. Send him here. Move away. Please come. Move away. Remove your footwear and go, see her quickly. This is just a news for all of them. I will allow only the child's family inside. Even if no one else sees her, you must! Go and see her.
