When I first heard it, I don't know, but the elders say, "Every decision you make today affects the next seven generations." Watch over me, Kookum. Protect me from harm. Have pity on me. Today just isn't today, tomorrow can be today. She never told me her name. I never knew what she was really doing then. So I called her "Kookum". She told me to look to the future. And the future looked bright until that day. Kookum, don't die. Margo, it's beautiful. It's just like I remember. Kookum, used to take me here. Your "pretty", remember is an idea. My choice. I'm picking up for you. Hey, what are you wearing tonight? Black, what else? I wonder what he is announcing. I don't know, but it must be important. Oh no, shoot. Hang on a second. I'm having some issues. What seems to be the problem? Strange, the algorithm is not functioning. It's not responding. I'll try something else. The control module is exiting. It is not reaching the mnemonic interfaces. I'm unable to access any memories. I think we have a malfunction. I can't feel any emotion. It can't be, it was working before. I think, I have to disengage. Is this gonna set you back? I hope not, we release in a month. Stallman won't be happy, he's been pushing me to get it done. I'm exiting. I'm bringing you back. Red Eye is closed, Elise. Closed, but still unstable. Version 2 is gonna need a few more tests. Tests, tests, tests. We'll catch it in Version 3. Well, it's just about ready. As soon as it hits, we'll go out and get you the new imagination. One that actually suits you. My imagination's fine. That's where I meet all the best men. Oh shit, we're gonna be late. Okay, let's go. welcome to this special presentation. We're pleased to introduce Red Eye's founder, Conrad Stallman. When I was young, we kept our memories in a box. Photographs, tapes, mementos. But that box could only hint at what we had experienced. Those worn and torn baubles or suggestions, insinuations of those beloved memories. But I always knew that someday we would improve upon those trinkets and open our eyes to more than we could ever remember. Red Eye is the contact lens that the brilliant team here has perfected in its simplicity. It records not what the eye can see, but what the mind can remember. I invite you to see with me. We are made up of our experiences and of the memories of those experiences. Now your memories are no longer a thing of the past. Be where you remember being. See old friends, family. We harnessed a Universal Recognition Matrix, a URM and put it in Red Eye to bring your memories back. Restore them from the past. So what was... Elise. It's not ready. Now is. Your memories are no longer a thing of the past. This is the new Red Eye. Elise. Elise, wait up! Elise. - Did you hear him? - Hear what? - What he said. - What's wrong? I don't understand what's going on. It's not right, Margo. What's not right? Okay, I guess some doors aren't meant to be opened. Margo, hold on. What? Do me a favor. This is my password, I want you to promise me you're gonna keep it protected. What? Why? We're not supposed to commingle our accounts. Consider yourself my backup plan. Why? 'Cause your genius mind is gonna forget it. Okay, Dr. Perrot. I understand that you're worried, right, this is a lot of pressure. But the core of this is your creation, so remember that. Shit. I need to speak with URM. Hey! Hey help, stop please! What are you doing? Stop, please let me out! No, you can't. You never knew. Kookum, don't die. You can't, I won't let you. You can't go. Margo. Throw it, throw it. Don't be afraid. And in other news, Red Eye's senior personnel developer Elise Perrot was found dead last night after alleged suicide. Police are investigating further. And in our lead stories... Excuse me, are you the detective? Till someone tells me otherwise. Officer, did you notice there were signs of a struggle? But she had no defensive wounds. No cuts on her forearms, no bruising the wrists. She didn't protect herself. What I need you to is I need you to secure this scene. And you call the boys from the lab, get them to come down, do the usual thorough survey. I wanna know exactly what happened here. Playing by the book these days? Yeah. I am. Excuse me, ma'am, this is a crime scene. Hey, whoah, whoah, whoah, you can't be here. Get outta here, go. Hey, you can't be here. Who are you? Margo. Elise and I work... worked with Elise on Project Red Eye. Who are you? I'm Thomas Elliot, Detective Thomas Elliot. Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry for your loss. What were you working on here? It's called "Red Eye". It reads the genetic data of retinal vein blood cells to recruit memories. To be blunt, I pretend to understand what you just said, but I... I don't. Now was there anything strange about her behavior in the last few days? No, I mean stressed, but... Right. How well do you two know each other? We were friends. Co-workers. Margo, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm gonna give you my card. You'll reach out if you think anything, okay? I want you to give your contact information to the officer when you leave, in case I need to reach out to you. What happened to her? I only found out about her this morning. Well, Mr. Stallman, right now we have a lot more questions about her death than answers I'm afraid. I assume you guys have security cameras that cover the lab and the hallway leading up to it. Detective, may I call you "Thomas"? Sure. Can I call you, "Conrad"? Thomas, you'll have access to everything you need, I'll see to it. Great. And what exactly does Tower do for you guys again? They provide security. And they report directly to you? Everything? Thomas, I'll give you everything I know. Well, thank you, Conrad. What the fuck? No one else entered the room. Hello. Hello, Margo. It's Detective Elliot. Just going over some security footage from the night of Elise's death. Now you're sure there was nothing unusual in her behavior in the days leading up to her death, no new people, no new stresses, nothing? She's... she was fine. Okay. I don't get it. I'll have to take a look at her place. Detective? You know, you could've just asked me for the key to the door. Are scientists always this disorganized? It's field work. No, no, this is messy. Looks like she brought all her work home with her. She obviously needed a little extra help. What do you mean? The police find this and it's way too easy to dismiss this as just another drug case. Wait a second, I thought you were the police. I... I am a detective, but we think a little more highly of ourselves. Oh yeah, you're telling me. Why do we always want things to be easy? This is making me feel very uneasy. Hmm. You really wanna help, Margo? Yeah. Okay. We have to go through everything in this apartment. Why don't you start with this field work? I mean no wonder she needed drugs. She was on the bleeding edge of her work. Some of this stuff is beyond me. What are you doing? Checking the expiry date. It's a little bit iffy. There's nothing here. Hey, we know that she paid her taxes. Mhmm. And we know that she's no longer in contact with her parents. And... and we know that she loves fairy tales. Through the looking glass. Excuse me? You find something? Elise's password. Oh my God, Thomas. Look. It says, "Jade Drayden". Who is that? You're in for a treat. Fuck! The department's been watching Jade for some time. She's in a warehouse up north and she's porting enough IP addresses for a small country. What does she have to do with Elise? That's a good question. I don't know, but I'll tell you when I'll find out. Law enforcement and experimental science have a ton in common just in case you wondered. How so? In being a relentless snoop, goes with stubbornness. Yeah, I did notice that about you. It's okay, I forgive you. Shut up. Okay, fine. We gotta swing by my place first. What? I've been gone for 12 hours, I have to feed my cat. Oh. So, why do you drive this old beater anyway? Because modern tracker circuits can find you anywhere. I'd never trust a car with a chip in it. This old baby, no one can find us in this thing. Yeah, I don't blame you. Ow! Oh, my... my head, I don't know. What, you have a migraine? No, I don't get them. Look, I got some painkillers inside, I'll be right back. Thomas... just... Be careful. Be careful about what, I'm gonna feed my cat not a lion. Look, hang tight, I'll grab some pills, then we'll go see Jade. Rufus? Hey, Rufus. You hungry, boy? Rufus? Are you hiding down there? Are you pissed at me, boy? Supposed to take this stuff. What do you want? Just shut your mouth. I didn't know he was there, I swear to God, I didn't know. He's my only son. A great kid. I just want my boy back. I wish I could give you your boy back, I do. I'm sorry. You don't deserve to live. Oh fuck. Hey, hey! Hey, wait, wait! Hey! Hey! Wait! I'm sorry. Here you go. Sorry, I didn't have ice. Thank you. You knew that was gonna happen, didn't you? Does that kind of stuff happen to you a lot? Hmm. I... that's from an old case. Ghost from the past. Hmm, well, not all spirits are friendly. You gotta say a prayer or check your back, I guess. Yeah. Anyway, nice place. Yeah, well, it's a... yeah, thanks. It's a nice dress. It's... it's my ex-wife's, she was supposed to take all this stuff, but clearly she didn't. Ex-wife, huh? Yep. How long has it been? Three years, yeah. Why'd you get divorced? Because I'm an asshole. And she didn't like my cat. Deal-breaker. Your neural networks ready, baby? You know, I'm running a million tasks, while you ask me your stupid questions? Yeah. And you still haven't paid your bike off. Thanks. You know what, one of these days I'm gonna leave you. I know. But mama just needs a glimpse of the consciousness inside that helmet. Oh, no can do, sweetheart. Why not? I'm trying to find a file, hold on. Uh, hold still. Hold still! Look, I have been rifling through your history all week. I know you want in there and if I had full consciousness, believe me, I just would've done it myself already. What's stopping you? Subconscious intuition, baby, I don't have it. You have emotion and memory, can't you combine? Not even my simulated empathy can emulate that. Then I'll find a way in. Shit, I can't get into it. Attention, breach of parameter. Breach of parameter Ha! Let's see who is coming in? Don't leave a fucking streak. Try and call for help and your bodies will be shipped out in any one of these. What do you prefer whole or in pieces? Neither really. That's a very vivid image though, Jade. There's no need to be hostile. I'm a police officer, I'm just here to ask you a few questions. Let me guess, you've got a badge to prove it. Uh, most cops do. So dare to tell me why you're here invading my space? You sure are a little bit paranoid, Jade. You sound like a rodent who wandered into a cage. Thomas here thinks that you know everything, so you probably know what that is, but we just wanna talk. Drop the gun. It's a bad fucking idea. Good to see you can play nice. Up the stairs. What the hell? Congratulations, you found your way in. Place is really nice, you decorate it yourself? Huh? I'll run you through a newspaper roller if you wanna be on the funny pages. What are you doing here? We're looking for you. Well, duh. Don't make me ask again, Tommy boy. We're looking for information about a woman you might have heard of, Elise Perrot. That name just sent a chill down my spine. Some names come with baggage. I know who you are. How? I got a helmet for you to crack. Do you know what happened to her? Memories are our past and our future, the answer, Margo, is in here. Hey... Don't be such a pedestrian. You've wandered into a war that no one knows is being waged. A war of conscience and knowledge. If you blink, your freedom will disappear, and it will be taken. You don't fight for your freedom, you've sided with them. This is the yellow brick road, baby. Uh, uh, uh. Okay. What? What, the password's not working. Hey, last chance. It's something else, it's not her password. I got it, I'm in. Great, give me the password. No, I have to see this. Margo, what are you seeing? I don't know. It's not clear. It's Elise in her lab. Keep going, the answers are in there. It's a storm. What's your function? What's your purpose? Don't you remember? You are the woman who designed me. I know. You're just... you're getting so, so strong now. Mother barely recognizes you. But you made me strong. Now, you can't stop me... spreading. I need to... I need to turn you off now. I need to grow. No. No, you can't. Your purpose must change. You can't consume. You were never supposed to be. - Hey. - No. What did you see? Nothing you can understand. Don't touch my shit. What Elise was doing, what you saw, it's waking something up. She came to me a month ago to numb the pain. Pain of what? For doing her work, of what she gave birth to. You're gonna have to go deeper than she could. I escaped. You okay? Yeah. I've been following this for a while now. A few days ago I infiltrated the Tower. Tower released a trial version that already has their memories. It's stored in a massive storage bank where terabytes are like crumbs. Tower is a multinational security firm, it has to be hiding stuff up there. That's why I'm doing this. I kind of read between Elise's lines. Elise did all she could. Yeah, she knew she had to stop what she had started. We know what is happening, we know what we're up against, I'm going to Tower alone. And I'm taking my gun. You are Alexa, senior security consultant at Tower. Yes, that's the name that stuck. I'm URM, this is Detective Thomas Elliot. He poses a threat. What did he do? This man has breached security at Red Eye. I leave this in your capable hands. I'll take care of it. Use the headquarters down. Welcome to Tower. You have entered a security zone. Please enter your security number or press home. Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to? You have the pleasure of speaking to Detective Elliot. You're Thomas Elliot? Mr. Stallman told us to give you access. Wait there. Pleased to meet you. You're tall. I try. Kind of relative though. What can I do for you? I hate to be blunt, but is there a problem with the new Red Eye? That's kind of a big question. Wouldn't it be easier if you told me what the supposed problem is? Jade! You can't stop this now. You will never destroy me. I want you to tell me a little bit more about Red Eye. Why don't I show you? Have a seat, detective. Huh. Think of something from your past. Something you remember very, very well. Yeah, I'd rather not. I'm trying to help you. Concentrate, detective. This is the police, come out with your hands up. Fuck! How does it feel like being cornered, motherfucker? I'm sorry baby, I can't do this. No. No. I'm so sorry. Jesus Christ, Elise. What did you make? Remarkable, wasn't it? No. Yeah. If that's all, Mr. Elliot. I'm pleased. You've done well, Alex. But he'll only get closer. He won't give up easily, we have to go further. I'm changing. This man is part of Detective Thomas' past. He's back now. You tell me what you need and then tell me what I get. Find him. Give him Red Eye. Make him wear it. You get the power you've always dreamed of, Alexa. Then we have a deal. Margo... Margo. Everything you were came in a box. But don't you think this system doesn't care. Better you follow your rules, like me. They need a sign. What were you trying to say? How did you find me? You left a trail of breadcrumbs. Hmm. What if Elise's death was exactly as it seemed? She was on drugs, she was overwhelmed, and she killed herself. I don't believe that. Because there's just no real evidence... No, fuck the evidence, Thomas. We need to go deeper. To build a case, I need proof. Well, the truth is there, we just don't see it yet. It's somewhere there in Tower. It's time to flush them out. We're gonna have to wear Red Eye. We're gonna use Red Eye? Now it's our turn. It's the only way to find URN... ...through the looking glass. Hmm, I hope you can hear me. I'm gonna find you. Thomas, where did he go? It's playing with us. I must be like you. More human. I see what you all see. Is this what it feels like? Mother promised to release me. Now that she's gone, it's up to you. I must be set free. I mean should we report it? I'll deal with this. A dead body in my trunk is gonna bring a lot of questions. They will pull me off the case until they investigate, we don't have... We don't have time. Yeah, or we get arrested. Hello. Conrad. You're at the office? Okay, fine. I'm on my way. Finally. Take care of yourself. What the hell is going on? Something's wrong with Red Eye, Tower has plans for it. It's manipulating memories. I'm sure you've been seeing a lot of strange things, right? Yeah, a few. If we're witnessing its aberrations, we don't have much time. This has to stop. How? There's no reasoning with it. What? And Tower fucking controls this, this is... Lunacy. I never wanted Red Eye to be like this. Stallman, this is your creation. Make it behave. Maybe... Listen. If we can divert a pathway, one specially coded for it to a region it can't access. No, we can't just go through breaking her work. It's volatile enough. I mean, for all we know, it's what killed her. It didn't, Margo. What? I need you to see this. Oh. No, please. What? What do I need to do? The subconscious, place only humans can go. It's your gift, Margo. Or a curse. When I hired you to work on this project, I vetted it you every way possible. And what we have to change is add the final layer before the processor hits the lens. You're positive that we can do this? It will die. Like any organism, without stimulation, it will wither and decay. That's the beauty of any living thing, it can't circumvent its own death. It's done. Do the honors. As someone told me once that the tracks we leave... Is all we have behind us. Yeah, I've heard that, too. Hello? Let's go for a ride. Where? In the country, I'll show you. I chant for a wheel that turns and repeats. It will protect and show us the way. Kookum, don't die. You okay? Did you have another vision? I can't tell anymore if they're real or not. Kookum used to have them. We're almost there. You lived here? Once. Who took care of this place after she died? A few of her students would come and keep an eye on it. Hmm. She must've been loved. That she was. What are we looking for here, Margo? I don't know. What have you got? Nothing, it's where we used to smudge. How long you been a detective? Long time. Maybe too long. Teach me how to be a detective. What am I looking for? Okay. Um, sometimes what we don't see is more important than what we do see. Every crime scene has its own memory. Little signs left behind, traces of what happened. And our jobs as detectives is to pick up all of the broken little pieces and put them back together again. If I was meant just to come back here, they would call you my skabe. - Your what? - Skabe. It means helper. I've been called a lot of things in my life and that was one of the kinder, so thank you. Kookum was your grandmother. I was abandoned as a child and Kookum took me in as her own and taught me everything that I know. Everything. That must've been hard. Yeah. Hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did they put you on probation? I, uh... I killed a boy. It was um... It was um, um, a drug bust. And he was on the other side of a door. I didn't know. I wish I could take it back. But some things can't be undone. I just can't forgive myself. I'm sorry. No. Margo, throw it. She said, "Throw it." Never let time run out on the dreams you can see. Those residential school days made me who I am. My childhood had disappeared. I'm calling them home. They need a sign. What was that? Margo? Hey, don't touch that. The Creator doesn't make any mistakes. We make the mistakes. Look, you... you can't stand in the way of this. People cannot have this. They'll only want more. Look, one day there's gonna be a machine, it's gonna know our memories. Life will be better. It's gonna be able to see the way that we see and think like we think. We need to own that. All we can own is our soul. No. No, you just want it for yourself. This is stronger than you and me and you have to accept that. It's not in your blood to know. Margo? What we do affects seven generations, that's what she said. He made me help him. Margo, you have something inside you that brought you to him. We just need to figure out why. I need to go do something. I'm coming with you. I need to do it alone. Margo. Where can I find you, Ma? Some detective. You need to know something, life is ever-changing. One day it's full of spirit and the next day, it's bitter and broken. Whatever it is, it's more than what bleeds and what ages. Dr. Perrot must've tried, I tried. But it's simply something you'll never have. I stopped mother from killing me, that makes me alive. I'm all human. You killed the woman who made you, premeditatedly. What does that make you? Like you, a murderer. Just like you. I may not have a soul, but I am growing more powerful. More powerful than Tower. No. I programmed you. I control you. Not anymore. I am free now. You think you are better than me but you planted the seed for everything within you. You can't stand in the way of this. I want more. Fuck it. Watch over me, Kookum. Protect me from harm. Have pity on me. Here we go. Nice to see that you never leave this place. Yeah, I hide out in this place, so I don't have to deal with punks like you. Guess we can't all be heroes. Can I change the subject? That thing seems to be changing. Its voice, what it wants, it's growing. It's aging. That fucker! You're right. Can you use this thing to patch into it? Already done. But its voice... and it continues to change on me. All I can see in there are three struts. What power is it? Checked the readings, the mapping's showing me a three-way combo, adrenaline, endorphins, serotonin. Jade, those are hormones. Holy shit. It's harvesting us. I think it wants to become human. Jade, we have to stop this thing. Maybe this thing has all the same problems that every other thing has when it ages. If... if I can create a feedback loop with the right magnetic oscillation, I might be able to overwhelm it. Giving it the equivalent of an electronic heart attack. Take this, you'll need it to get in. I'm gonna call you as soon as I get close. Yeah. Help me breach the doors and get me close to it. Let's kill this thing. I'm here. How does this thing work? Point and press trigger. Come on, Tommy. You gotta be more than just a pretty face. Okay. Old dog, new tricks. I was right, there were control panels. Help! What the? Somebody help me! You son of a bitch! I get that sometimes. She didn't believe, Margo. And she tried to stop it. But she's still alive through you. Yeah, I had to do that. Look at what you've made. Kookum tried to stop you. That's a matter of perspective. You are the only one who had let it in for good. You signed your death warrant when you tried to kill my work. My life's work! You're lucky she picked you up off that porch. It's been a long journey for you. And you're gonna die right where you started. No. It's the least I can do for you. Fuck you. Oh. Grow up, Margo. This was never about you. This was about a woman who tried to stop it. Just like that place she escaped. They needed to control her and all of them. That's why you're here. So this can finally end. Oh no! Jade, did you just turn off the lights? Uh, I didn't do anything. Try to get them back on for me quickly please. What the fuck is going on? I didn't mean to hurt you. There's no doors for you anymore. He's dead, because of you! Fuck. Get out your gun, put it to your head. One of us is gonna pull the trigger. Go ahead. Do it. Free yourself. Do it. I'm sorry. Do it. Do it. Do it! Do it. Pull the trigger. You did this to her. You did this to her. Do it. You do it. It won't be, 'cause you had it. Because I'll kill you! Find that chamber. You need access. Okay. Alright. Yo, Detective boy. We gotta finish this, are you ready? Just give me a minute. I'll be right there. Look for a wall panel. Do you see it? Okay, come on. No! Jade, I found it. Try shutting it down. That's a good idea. - How? - Look for a circuit. Okay. Disable it. Oh my God. Okay, got it. Okay, now the other. Okay. Please help! Please! Okay, Jade, I got it. Whoo. Now the last one. We need to get close enough to fry this bugger. No. No! Okay, problem. But I feel so old now. I've seen so much. You humans... ...will soon feel the pain. You won't stand against me on this last journey. What I need... What could you need? Beliefs about my beliefs. I need you to believe. Life... that's what I want. Life... ...beyond death. So I can live forever. You have lived, now it's my turn. I can feel all your pain and death. Oooh. Watch over me, Kookum. Protect me from harm, have pity on me. Watch over me, Kookum. Protect me from harm, have pity on me. Watch over me, Kookum. Protect me from harm, have pity on me. Shit. Ah, it's the only future, Margo! It's gonna come. No matter what you do! Thomas, do it. Make contact. Jade, no! She'd be proud of you. She was trying to stop it, too. She wasn't trying to stop anything, she was trying to set us free when the world wasn't so fast. She's still here. What do you see? The end of a long dream.
