Nine years have passed since that black day... That Paris, prince of Troy, abducted Helen, Wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta . For nine years, sworn to avenge the insult, Greek kings and princes, the biggest heroes, Trying to understand Troy. Behind the tall, impregnable walls, where Paris clutching Helen, -a Valuable loot him, a heavy attack for Ellines- Troy reached the end of its resistance. Hector, son of King Priam, brother Charmer Paris, The bravest of the Trojans, killed by Achilles, Thus avenged his friend, Patroclus, Which killed Hector a duel. The body of the Trojan hero, Crawling triumphantly the chariot of Achilles, Engraved into the dust an omen for the fate of fraudulent Troy. And so began the tenth year war. Let's feed the birds with the corpse of Prince I killed with my sword. Hector, the killer of Patroclus, will pay double his crime. This is the revenge Achilles, the Trojans! Achilles sealed the fate of my brother. A fate that the haunted for nine long years. What is our fate... fate of Troy? Who knows. Another day life is you only win... With the sad price on fighting daily. The Trojan War Get out ahead! Will follow you and attack the last. I wanted a Greek prisoner, but alive! Try it with this. Try this one day at a Greek who can defend. I have to tell you, Aeneas... That although m'endiaferei whether to live or die... I admire your accomplishments watching on the walls. I envy cunning and your courage. Which of the two virtues would you choose? Although I like both, Aeneas... ... I cunning. Useful in glorious warriors. Or in cowards who have much to lose. And you, Paris, got a lot to lose. Your valuable pelt. Bring the prisoner. I want to interrogate. Rejoice, Aeneas. The soldiers will follow. - Wherever drivers, Aeneas. - I have no aspirations for leader. This cursed war has already lasted too long. No woman is worth the blood spilled nine years now. Much more Helen. Eleni is a symbol of power and glory of Troy. Yes, a power watered with the blood of the Trojans. Helen of Sparta, Menelaus woman , And lover of Paris... will be our grave. With these ideas have won antipathy Courtyard And the Council of Elders. But now you must be careful even more. The Paris is watching. With every word you put additional risk your life. I say what you say and Hector. The But Hector is dead. And who now runs? The Paris. Be careful, Aeneas. Aeneas! Creusa! Aeneas! As we saw in the walls, I almost crazy with fear. You should be careful. Not to go on the walls. Why should I hide my anguish? I worry like other women. How not want to see as the other who boast about their men? I am the wife of Aeneas. I want to know it all. My father, Paris, all of Troy. If Paris learned our secret... Would make you hurt, by his hatred for me. Our joy is to have each other. Our misery that must to hide our joy. But how long yet? I have to know. Not very. One day this war will end . One day will come peace. Believe me. The prisoner said that organizing games in honor of Patroclus. - Will last for two days. - What else the prisoner said? Will join the bravest warriors. What else, Paris? The body of Patroclus, dressed in white... And smeared with oil, is on the funeral pyre. Where is the body of my son? What did you learn? The mother and I his wife want to know the truth. Hector is next to Patroclus, dust underfoot. In the dust? The body of my son! In cold soil, to irrigate with blood? Exposed to wild heads of his enemies. He lies in eternal peace, mother. Not suffer, because the sun, cold, wind... Even hate the Greeks, not touch him anymore. But in our hearts, Cassandra... There is peace... No peace reigns. Tell me what you intend to do body? We will draw on the rocks Tenedos... And they will leave it there prey to the vultures. This mother, is the will of Achilles. Hector lying there like newborn child... Just he saw the light of day. Bring me my son! We have to go. The body of our brother awaits us. - Vain effort Deiphobus. - For nine years the Achaeans have ward ... All our attacks. - The weapons are powerless about it. The tears only less overwhelming with tears, not with blood. You go alone, Cassandra, to pour my tears. Alone and unarmed. King Priam can not be dragged in front of the enemy. The prayers and tears are the only weapons for a frail old man. Achilles will kill you! Who Death is better for a father... From death by the hand that killed his son? - We will come with you. - I go alone. Myself... Achilles... Alone... My only weapons will be my tears. - What do you want? - And I'll come. - I do not need protection. - I however will come. Aeneas, well know your courage, but does not accept your audacity. I hear the voice of Hector. Your son and my friend calls us both. I pray thee, Pallas Athena, Which govern the destiny of mortals . Accept my sacrifice... Help to return my father and my husband... Unharmed from the Greek camp. For the safety of our old man father... And on his return to sacred Troy with the pile of Hector, My sister Creusa and Kassandra you speak with the gods, Offer these two lambs to sacrifice to Athena. Mermaid offer the life of a lamb, but slowly your own! What does this mean? If a design life of our father why you let him go alone? You know very well that this was the desire. However, someone who does not belong in our family, disobeyed. Who? O Aeneas! Never loses opportunity to win popularity. Undoubtedly has managed to learn all Troy recent feats. Fraud if the credit it yours vile intentions. Aeneas is a warrior. No need of the popularity, which you seek by any means. Even with your sacrifices to the gods. I would love to see your hero... When you are face to face with the terrible Achilles. Stop the games. Simoste, Trojans and our fun with the music of your Wailing. In front of him must kneel! You think your tears will bring my friend Patroclus back to life? The tears can not do anything for him now . Hector killed Patroclus... And you Hector. Achilles grieving for a friend... Priam for a son. Brag that your grief is heavier? Then, bare your chest. our fun with your pain. Others may be in lypountan... But not me! What asks Achilles for the body of Hector? Patroclus! Patroclus! What to answer? Thousand chests gold? And a mountain of precious gems up to your funeral pyre? Better the psychorragima all prisoners! Achilles does not kill defenseless. - You Aeneas? - Yes. Friend Hector, like you Patroclus. There came to negotiate to the pile? No. Turned back, gray-haired, before they send you to Hades. Have you decided to pay me with your life? Consequential your feet something worth more. On my dignity and honor of my ancestors. I will do the necessary for your son. Transfer the body of Hector in my tent! Wrapped in a linen shroud. Please Achilles... Yes, I beg you... Allow me to prepare a my son. Go. Stay here, Troa. He has much to say to his son. And when the living speak to the dead... It is better not to hear. Courtesy of Agamemnon, struggles may continue. This tripod solid gold... Offered by Achilles to the winner of flo-tug of war. The winner will be the one which will not pass this line. Look now, Aeneas. See the power Greek warriors. In know him? Ajax, the strongest of the Achaeans. I have seen in battle. Nobody goes to power. Noticed. Well done! Well done, Ajax! You can leave. Quiet! Those who boast about their fists let's go ahead to fight. Four talents gold award, by generous Achilles. Four gold ingots? You buy olive groves! Worth the risk. Anyone who wants the prize, should be imputed to me. And now? Do you think better? Four talents are many... But I love my life! Why do not you try it? And I love her! Well, my friends? What do you expect? Courage! At most to break you in two! The Trojan laughs at us, Agamemnon. Comes peacefully. I m'afisete win the without any effort? Let's treat it like a guest and to ask him to participate. We know him to Ajax. I will, Ulysses. Add to award two of the fastest horses in the world. Nobody dares? The Greeks leave Price in Trojan, If you have the courage to fight with the terrible Ajax. Th'agonisto for one prize only: arms of Hector. Ambition can you wear? The claim for Andromache, his wife. You ask me the most precious spoils in nine years of war, Aeneas. But I accept. In honor of Patroclus, Aeneas accepts the challenge... ... For the glory of the nation. - And Ajax on our own. Follow me. Once the signal has been given, you do two rounds with your horse... Anyone who reaches first will have the advan- tage use this... ... Glove. Advantage... that will help to return to Troy alive. The fight will take place within on that cycle. Whoever loses pop out... Or remaining in... dead. Ready. Get out! Front, Ajax! What i do not like to Ajax. Aeneas runs to the inner. Look now. Hopefully n'apallagoume shortly by another enemy. Begin! Come on, kill him! Now you got him! Come, Ajax, Do it over! Now I know that Troy has a my warrior worthy. Now I know that the kindness of an enemy make war even more hateful. Our names are legendary, Paris. Not only for others, and for us. If kept together. The Paris without Helen... is nothing. And Helen without Paris is only an adulteress. One more reason to defend our relationship, at any price. If split, all will be lost. And exactly what awaits Aeneas. There are worries that even if wear arms of Hector. But they gave him the right talking to the Council. N'archisei I do not want to talk to me. And especially against me. Would not dare. Even Priam is against... And I... I will be your defender. Archelaou! He stayed n'anakoufiseis power my feeble body? Course. When you get up, you will be like not fought at all today. Later. Not show be surprised who you see here. I am surprised that you did not come earlier. Before you were just a man. Now you are the "Aeneas". , But you never th'allaxeis. Are the "Helen". You say my name as an insult. Perhaps because you do not know. Probably to think unfeeling, incapable n'agapiso. If you come to betray Paris, To ultimately Menelaus the revenge, another betrayal, Unfairly lose your words. You were wrong. If sent to Paris, willing to pay this price, Hoping to say tomorrow at the Council he deserves to die for you, Again wasting your words. Or if any thought that your infidelity cost several deaths, Turn around in your Menelaus and Paris let hanged. If there is no way to convince you, is no way to crush. Do sorry... But the walls of Troy facing a sea of blood. When many thousands of heroic men die for one woman... Their glory will last eternity. Perhaps... But eternity is not enough fit the horror of that glory. Archelaou! Start. Rub in well. This will do. We have lost so many men and do unnecessary discussions. I only ask Greeks is the return of Helen. Costs, the affected value dead... everything will be forgotten. Is the first time, Aeneas, that participate in the Council. You can speak freely. - Already you know our views. - Like you mine. Nothing will convince me that happiness Trojans... Must be sacrificed for the sake of an adulteress. It's not my choice defending the people... But the precious symbol learned from Sparta. The pride and glory of Greece. There is no glory in misery. We speak different languages, Aeneas, but yours be alone. Hector, o Your brother died to fool your adventure. But we spoke the same language. Kassandra, your sister, our portends for havoc. - The voice is of the gods. - Kassandra is crazy! In heard, Aeneas. By peace one people does not earn a place in history. Many generations will praise the glory those with wars like that... Won immortality. You know, Priam, that our resources are exhausted ? What men, what weapons, what foods will continue the war? All Phrygia in knows and admires. Go talk to them. Bring our soldiers and cavalry of Dardanians. Bring us an army, Aeneas. - What if they refuse? - Is the order of the king! And the Council of Elders. How will defend Troy to turn? We will ask the Greeks truce. I'm going to negotiate too. Perhaps refuse. The war has not yet exhausted all our gold. You will offer all the gold city Agamemnon... In exchange for a ceasefire. And thou, Aeneas, will leave tonight. With ten horsemen escort. You can rely on me, Aeneas. I will watch myself. I'm grateful, Andromache. You look at me from the walls tonight? Yes. Tonight time will stop for me. Do not worry, darling. I'll be back again. Aeneas! Aeneas, if only you knew... Tell me, Creusa. If you knew how much I love you! Goodbye, Creusa. I did not find the courage to tell him that will become a father. If the learned, perhaps insisted to stay beside me. The mission depends salvation of the city. True, and She worried about more who separated... If he knew that the life of the unborn child and mine... Would be exposed in inhumanity of Paris. I'll be by your side, and my house will be yours. Come. What reason I agree for so long truce? Do you know the answer, Agamemnon. Gold! - How? - Four tanks filled. Other eight silver and jewelry. Not quite. The twice! We have so many. Continuous ceasefires have stripped us. When conquer us... if conquer us... Would find only sticks and stones. Then solve the siege, when not worth overwhelmed. The decision is yours. And double gold to you give, will not beckon us to accept. If you have exhausted, the truce will not help you! We heard your opinion, Achilles. How about you, Ajax? No. - Diomedes? - No. Menelaus? I am willing to sign a peace. I prefer a truce. My only requirement, repayment the Spartan queen. Helen will be very flattered... Learning that you care so much about this yet. You, Ulysses? No value will not achieve truce for the Trojans today... Except maybe if they surrender. But after do not intend to surrender... Let us be generous. Accept the truce. Why? "Why?" Because says Ulysses. I leave to you, then, can specify terms. The gold offer is satisfactory. But instead of silver, we... timber. All the wood you have. And find as much extra. What you need? I asked why I need truce? - Granted. - I have not finished yet. Besides, we ten nobles for hostages. As a guarantee that you will respect the truce . And now, if you want, you can say ... "in line". You have what you seek. A... At least one of the hostages... Should be your family. Rejected Why silver? Need wood. - Why? - Explain to us. On the battlefield our army is invincible. But nine years now unable to climb the walls of Troy. Well? I want to fight the Trojans... ... Inside the walls. Well you say, but how will manage? Theseus! If you entered a tent abandoned by the enemy, Would take this item? Course. He belonged to my right. - You would take it to your house? - Yes. What you trying to say? Would bring death in your home. I suggest that you make a horse. A wooden horse. Large enough to fit a group of men . Now I have time and materials to do it. What musings abash your peace? Aeneas has gone and will turn with an entire army allies. What you worry? You can choose a hostage from your family. You decided? You have chosen you and will accept it. What? If I told you... Aeneas? Why mention Aeneas? It is a way to talk to Creusa. On my sister? On your sister who farewell so tenderly Aeneas when he left. The Creusa! Very rarely what you forced to do... Proved so enjoyable. What appeared to call me? You, Helen? I, but not easy tell you what I want. Tell me quickly, got bad news? You have chosen to be sent as a hostage. - From my father? - From me. A decision with incredibly saddened. Yes, as I was sorry when you choose other hostages... Friends of Aeneas! But surely you're not his girlfriend. I am something more. I love him. Even better. Your sincerity relieve my conscience. Very well. Your wickedness relieves from your hideous company. At least until the end of the truce . It is our most valuable and of the entire cavalry of Achilles. You think the Trojans will bite the bait? I spread the hostages that the horse is sacred... And whoever holds protected by the gods. Why believe that the left into enemy hands? I have thought about this. Sinon! On your orders, Odysseus! Here is the key of my plan. This is Sinon. In peacetime, known as the best actress in Greece. It is the "groom" our horse. Is something scary size of this horse. What is intended? It is the sacred animal of Poseidon. They want the favor of God. The truce will expire in seven days... And then they will attack Troy. - If Aeneas not arrive on time... - It would be the end of us. But Aeneas always keeps his word. Glaucous, I want the fastest rider. Fiber! Go to Troy and alerted Paris that arrive tonight. Be prepared barracks. Diomedes! Diomedes! Come quickly to see! Look there! Trojans! Hurry! Everybody back to camp! If you do not stop the army Aeneas outside the walls, Your plan has not chances to succeed. - This is not predicted. - We have to attack immediately. In the open field. Unfortunately we can not do otherwise. - And the truce? - The wanted to collect army. - And we to prepare a trap. - For me, the ceasefire was violated. For me, no. I gave my word. Your reason? Yes, your reason, but data is another matter. - I agree with Menelaus. - And I. - And I! We will face them in the plain. Between the forest and the swamp. Me not to count. War for glory, not be disgraced. If the battle favorably roll, will not need him. If not, you will come to help. I know Achilles. Gather men. We attack immediately. Aristocles to convey Trojans hostages on board. Aeneas! The army of Greeks marching against us! Traitors! It seems that they want to cut our the city. Hipparchus, convened the governors. Once the Greeks found within range of our bow, you , Archilochus, you retreat to the narrow valley, Like having order to defend. You, Hipparchus, will move, to protect Archilochus. The Greeks will attack frontally, aiming the left wing. On my signal will make it disorderly retreat to the forest. They will try to encircle so the first phalanx. - But then they stormed their cavalry. - This is exactly what I want. Now, hurry. Go! Forward, men! Go! It's time. Tell Hipparchus in retreat. Front, Surround them! Why, by Zeus, not rushes Diomedes the parts disappear? Go thou, Odysseus. I would have been gone if their flight was not so hasty. What do you mean? It would be better to wait a little longer? Diomedes loses time trying to circle the first phalanx. If the Trojans reassembled will attack from behind. Go, Ulysses. I do not like to correct a mistake with another mistake. But after what you want... You are the commander in chief. - The cavalry of Ulysses. - Just as you had predicted. Hide the men in the woods and not wasted any arrow. When you understand that we are there, it is too late. Dardania! Now is your time! Assault! In the back of Diomedes men! Go! Everybody back to camp! Immediately! Salpiste retreat! Gather all forces! Front for the Greek camp! If Aeneas managed to stem the Greeks, Before reaching the camp, the war is over! Paris, all the Greek army has fled. Your men eager to fight with Aeneas. We have the chance to crush the enemy. For 10 years the camp has withstand all our attacks. I am sure that the warriors Aeneas will fail again. I can not leave the city defenseless . To tell Aeneas to return with the army in Troy immediately! Immediately! As you wish. The Greeks defeated. Aeneas won! We freed! Get locations on wall. In the north and east. You go to your tents and get ready to board our vessels. - What are you going to do to us? - We'll take you with us. Creusa should be obvious brave. I will try to escape. A CAT! It is the only way to save you. To get Aeneas and to come to liberate. 'll Kill you! Then I will give my life for a worthy purpose. Raise the bridge! Why not sent forces Paris... To stem the decline of Greek ? The war would end! Hipparchus, ordered his men n 'regroup... And prepare for the final assault. Aeneas, the Paris ordered to turn around in Troy immediately army. The sun is still high and the help of God will conquer. 's Order. And Paris is the commander in chief. Glaucus led the army back to town. Archelaos bring my chariot. You four, bring it here! A CAT! The Creusa... Talk. Is captive enemy. - The Creusa? captive? - Hostages. To go to... ... Ships. Is dead. We will now attack! Get the beam of my chariot. Go! Quickly! Aristocles will not be able to reach ships. It is very weak. - Pity her, to beg. - I have orders. Let's wait here. I would fetch a chariot. I'm grateful. The rest, go! Cover with the shields. Pull firmly! Follow me! Seems Aeneas defied your orders. He'll regret it. Broke into the fort and turn tonight triumphant Troy. We need to act now, before it is too late. Yes, Aeneas can be opened the door, But I will give the decisive blow. - Follow me! - Go! We need also other chariots! No. Only those of Agamemnon. Never mind. Should stop their cavalry, ... Before we cut off ap'ti sea. - And Creusa, daughter of Priam? Will do too. Go! Afippefste! Ships! Ships! - Join me! - No! No! Aeneas! No! Let me! Aeneas! Aeneas! Go ahead, shoot! Aeneas! Creusa! If I knew... I knew that you would come. The fruit of our love stirs inside me. Our son... Do the gods bless never know... The stench of war... ... Only the pleasures of life. - Achilles! - Yes. Should be run. Ships danger. If you get there Aeneas, will be the end of us! Achilles has not ever put feet. No, no, my friend. Have faith in my plan. Will open up sea and tomorrow we will be back again. Tomorrow! In the night. Alkinoi! My arms! What are you doing? You cope Aeneas on the battlefield. I can not prevent it, but do error. - Paris! - What is; Hurry! The Greeks regressed to the sea. I cut out the retreat. Now victory will not escape us. Paris! Look! - The Myrmidons of Achilles. - We have to send all the power. Wait. It is useless. Troilus, run to tell Aeneas to intervene immediately to Dardania. Quick, Troilus! Go, glaucous. Lead to Troy. Be the trust in Andromache and do keep on with your life. Begin! Aeneas! Achilles with Myrmidons threatens to overwhelm us. Salpiste be drawn cavalry of Dardanians. Front, Greeks! Go! It is written in fate, our blood to paint this land. Or mine or yours. Gladly was mine, if it brought peace. But as long as you live, the war continues. Defend yourself, Trojan, and let the gods decide. If Aeneas beat Achilles, Nobody will have opposition to take power. - Achilles invincible. - Body to body. But will advise can do everything... To steal victory from Aeneas. Watch out! Go! A poisoned arrow is more effective than a sword. Where to dive? In your blood? Remember, Aeneas, that I killed Achilles... And enter triumphantly in Troy, dragging his body to dust. This is not because I plan to go to the Greek camp. Be careful, Aeneas. Think about your reputation. The Myrmidons riders decimated. They left the camp. Put guards. Tomorrow will push them into the sea. Why so much haste, Aeneas? In regard? I imagined that you'd with your soldiers... Not visiting women of the palace. What are implying? The Creusa. What to do? Nothing . Will remain with Andromache. But you should meet with the memory. If you have the opportunity to to remember. Continued, Paris. Reach essentially of your perverse thoughts. To listen to is more intolerable than to see you. You hear what I have to tell you, since you asked. Committed treason today twice! Refused to return to the city with the army... And handed the body of Achilles Greeks. Take me before the judges. Judges me if you dare. If your truth is stronger than mine, surrender. But I tell the truth, Paris, and not psefdologimata. You have so much confidence in a public trial? No matter how much you have to murder! Can m'empodiseis talk to my defense... But will not avoid categories of the dead Whose blood got on your conscience. The ship sailed with his army. They wait behind Tenedos. Sinon, now everything depends on you. I play the best role of my life. Even though the Trojans not to applaud. Go hide somewhere that is easy to find yourself. I will make them feel lucky who found me. So warriors and the war will be won by an actor. The actors triumph because the genius of the authors. Hurry! No time. Join the horse! Greeks fled the camp! What did you say? The Greeks left! Hooray! The war is over! The Greeks left! We won! The war is over! The Greeks left! We won! We won the war! The war is over! The Greeks fled with their ships! The war ended. Glorified it 's gods. Dardanians Paionians and allies from Phrygia! My victory over Achilles and your bravery... Dispelled the last hope of enemies. Our Aeneas led to victory! - He won the war! - Why not you? Remained in Troy because state affairs, But I speak on his behalf. You can return all to your homes. Today you have as wheat and wine you want. Besides, each one of you will be rewarded with gold. In addition, everything found in Greek camp is yours! Paris! We found a Greek! Hiding in a haystack, but half body seemed! Be the first cut head or feet? You... finally facing the great commander? The Paris, why poets will knit wreaths of glory? You who killed the invulnerable Achilles? I thank the Olympian gods for this great honor! For this priceless gift a common man... Be killed by the hands Tran Paris! If you give away his life, will be faithful servant of Paris? Swear on this holy horse, Dedicated to Poseidon, which govern the seas, Because this is the will of Zeus. You'll live. And this horse... Who made these fugitives, to have the favor of the gods, Is now our trophy and will transfer it to Troy. Man transformed into a monster... In man monster hiding... Kassandra, enough with the voice of thy madness . Inside the monster death lurks. Destroy it, otherwise will destroy us all! This horse is the testimony of our triumph. It is sacred. Your tragic prophecies do not come true. Today is a day of celebration. For all Trojans! Do not I see it, I am not on the side of... - Is the worst torment you... - not tortured, Aeneas. If your son was born tonight, th'akouseis the crying. For a moment, your heart will stop beating... And then will begin again, but cheerful rhythm. He came close and tell her from me... What my own lips can not express. Before to leave, he told me: "Go look in my eyes Aeneas." This night is so dark... None light can illuminate the city... Only the flames of destruction! And this silence, Aeneas, be stunned my soul. The city sleeps, Cassandra... And for the first time in nine years, having peace. The Trojans do not dream tonight... But I dream to Troy. And I only see nightmares! We live with the nightmare of the past for a long time. But for that which is intended to come... Who...? ... Who will find the time to mourn , Aeneas? It is a night that should not finish. Kassandra... Your voice to me is the voice of truth. However, remains dull, even for me. Find the Glaucus and my friends. Tell them that I am here. I will, Aeneas. This is the slogan. Launch infantry. Go! Burn the city! The city is on fire. The Greeks! Glaucous, gathered those who can. We will defend the citadel. Follow me! The Greeks! In the palace! Will not show any mercy. Not to you. They will slay with me. We will be united forever. These flames burn each bond. Our own has already destroyed these ten years. Helen, what to do? You could try escape way, but do not know where. Or fight, but does not have the power. Or you kill yourself, but does not have the courage. You can only expect to thy give the final blow... That will send to nothingness. Menelaus! Menelaos... Pick it. Pick it! Val'to on your head. In your Head! Wear! Thus. And now, in that bed. Go! Move! Sit down. Sit down! Very well. Get. Stabbed him and you. To erase your picture still shining in his eyes. We turn the camp. There is no salvation. Stop! This time is no match, Aeneas. I hurt a lot, Cassandra! Andromache! The flames reached the palace! The Greeks are everywhere! Go to the east gate. From there you still have to go. But the Creusa... I can not leave her. I'll stay here. Must protect your son. Aeneas! Aeneas! Creusa... Creusa! I wanted so much to tell you... Now they never said. Our hopes were lost, our dreams died. As I can still confront... Before the gates of the kingdom of Hades shut behind you... I want to tell you only this: I love you, Creusa. And will you still love her with love for your son. The Creusa died to give it life. - And I will give him mine. - You must live, Aeneas... You and your son you would not our deplorable fate. - Your destiny will be glorious. - Aeneas! Aeneas, is still open way to go. Your soldiers guarding him. Go, Aeneas. Troy lives her last night. For millennia people will be looking to ashes... To find the remnants majestic walls... But under other skies, some other shores... Troy will be reborn... The glory of your nation. - You can be saved and you. - I've already saved. My victory is in your destiny. Let me now lamenting my sister. Aeneas! Come! It's time to go with you, Creusa. The horror that we have seen over the years will live eternally in the myths. Come... Come with me. Come. Aeneas. Bring it to me. I was a mother. The flames devastate their past, but illuminate the way for the future. Far away, the unknown coast of Italy... Where the nation Aeneas will find safety... A new city emerges, which will bedazzle the world. Troy was perishable... Rome will stay famous as the Eternal City. >
