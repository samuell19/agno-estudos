Dedicated to Jacques Prévert Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, forgive me. It is an honour and a privilege to tell you a story which, for once, is absolutely true. I know, because I was there when it happened. And I wasn't the only one. I had happily built my nest on the roof of the great palace of the vast kingdom of Tachycardia. In those days Tachycardia was still ruled by Charles V plus III making VIII plus VIII making XVI. He wasn't a very good king. He hated everyone. And everyone in the kingdom hated him right back. He was a lonely king and his favourite pastime was hunting so, as you can imagine, we weren't the best of friends. HERE LIES MY BELOVED WIFE. VICTIM OF AN UNFORTUNATE HUNTING ACCIDENT! Congratulations! His Majesty is a good shot. What marksmanship! Long live His Majesty! Murderer! I've said it once and I'll say it again: murderer! And I have something to add: you are an awful thug! An awful thug, that's what you are! There's no other way to describe you. Think you can shoot at poor creatures and still be called "Majesty"? How dare you, you pathetic bird brain!

What do you expect? You can't love everyone. Especially if you don't know them. What about you? Who do you love? Me? I only love you. - And you? - I feel the same way. I only love you. You're the nicest chimney sweep I know. And you're the prettiest shepherdess I've ever seen. Have you seen many? No. Not even in my dreams. Believe me. I know from experience. I've told you a hundred times already. You two aren't meant for each other. To start with, you're not even the same colour. A shepherdess and a chimney sweep! It's out of the question! It's out of the question. I have fallen in love with you, little shepherdess. And I am the King. You must not waste your time with that sooty cinder-boy. I love you. We must marry. It's obvious. What are we waiting for? - Right? - There's no doubt about it. Besides, that's what it says in the storybooks. The shepherdess always marries the King. There are no two ways about it. Therefore I decree: The ceremony will take place this very evening in the palace when the clock strikes midnight. I have spoken. Believe me, I know from experience. They won't go far. Everything is under lock and key. And besides, there are no doors. It's merely a little escapade of no importance. They'll soon be back, you'll see, before you know it. Where are they? If I were to speak from experience. I'd say they had gone. I never thought that the sky could be so beautiful. Don't worry, the world is so wide, they won't get far. And they're so young! They'll be afraid. They'll be back. In any case, you may as well get used to it. You can't get out of here, either. We'll see about that! Oh, there you are! Congratulations! Good job! A fat lot of use I can be to you with a broken leg! Imagine breaking the leg of a man of my age and my worth! It's bound to bring you bad luck. I don't know why I don't give you a good kick up the backside! Police! Police! Police! Police! Long live His Majesty! At your service, Your Majesty. What do you desire? A charming shepherdess whom I have fallen in love with has been abducted by a wretched good-for-nothing chimney sweep. I want... I command... I demand... that you find them as quickly as possible! Oh, look! Little birds! Thank you, chimney sweep. How kind of you to rescue my little boy. He's such a foolish boy. He walked right into the trap. and not for the first time. By the way, my friends, you'd better watch your step around here. In fact the traps densely populate this vast kingdom of Tachycardia. There are child-traps and bird-traps and... You're not listening. You're looking at the world. It's well worth a look. Take it from me. I've travelled a lot. I've been around the world. Niagara falls. The "Bells of Corneville".

He has blond hair and both have blue eyes. - Young? - Very young. Hello, children. Who are you? Where are you from? Do you bring news? Does the world really exist? Does the sun really shine? Yes. We've seen it. What is it like? It's bright and yellow. It's golden when it rises and all red when it sets. We saw the moon too. We know how it works. The bird explained. The bird? They saw a bird too! I told you, my friends. We are saved. The world exists, the sun shines and there are birds. Life is wonderful. We'll all see it one day. Let the music play! Mockingbird! At last I have found you! We will be married without delay. It's in all the storybooks. The King always marries the shepherdess. Don't tell me you refuse. Why? Silly question! She's in love with the chimney sweep. The chimney sweep? What? The chimney sweep? Not him again! Here's what I'm going to do to that chimney sweep of yours! No! No! Say yes, just to stall for time. I'll sort it all out later. Stop! I'll marry you. - What will you do to them? - Don't worry. They'll be safe. I'm going to put them to work. It's the best thing for them. You said they'd be free. To work, my dear, is to be free. Life is wonderful. The sun will shine. Soon we shall see birds again. ID CARD FOR VOLUNTARY LABOUR Be patient. This can't go on forever. Long live His Majesty! The crime of insulting the royal person. Let's see... No clemency, article 28. Violators of article 28 in here. Bravo! Bravo! Who spoke? Someone said "bravo"? Who was it? I did. - Who are you? - The Mockingbird. A bird? A real bird? That's what the youngsters said. It had to be true! A bird! A great bird, with feathers! Multicoloured. Do you know how to fly? What a question to ask! Judge for yourself. I hear the beating of his wings. It's fantastic! He's flying! Don't get so excited. It's only natural. And he can talk as well! All languages. I'm an interpreter. Polyglot, monoglot. I speak fluent Toucan, English, Latin and... Rabbit as well. And Chinese and Parrot, naturally. And Lion! - Lion? - Absolutely, Lion! That's what I said. I can prove it too. How extraordinary! What did you just say? I said: "Hello, my friends!" "How are you doing?" And what did they answer? "Everything's terrible." They said they were bored in here and very hungry. And so I said: "Enjoy your lunch." Just to be polite. But I shouldn't have said that. Music! Play something cheerful, for heaven's sake! Otherwise, they'll devour him. Devour who? The chimney sweep! Who else? The boy? He's here? Yes. Play. Quick! And the shepherdess? The King took her. - Why? - To marry her. Stop asking questions and play. What a dreadful fate! They were such nice youngsters. Such a sad story! They're big softies at heart. You just need to know how to handle them. My dear friends... Good, brave beasts of the wild, you have taken pity on this poor, suffering chimney sweep. How fine! How noble! Congratulations. May we have some music? Something powerful! But as I was saying, once you hear the whole sordid tale behind this monstrous set-up then, my feline friends, I know that your righteous indignation will not be confined to the four walls of this wretched prison! An innocent shepherdess tending her sheep... But who was she tending her sheep for? Not for herself, the poor child! But for you, my lion friends! Yes, for you, my friends. That's right! This sweet shepherdess was tending those fat, juicy sheep of hers for you, my good friends. When suddenly... the King... Do you know what the King did? Well. My friends? He kidnapped the shepherdess who was tending her sheep. And the sheep ran off to the four corners of the earth. The poor little creatures! The poor, fat, juicy and defenceless creatures! Frightened and dishevelled, livid, at the mercy of storms, threatened by avalanches, rolling over the edges of high cliffs! And those who escape fall into the jaws of a hungry wolf. What's that racket? They're coming! - Who's coming? - The birds! At last, the birds! They're going to save us! - The birds! - Hurray! Here we come, my friends. Make way for the birds. Hurray for the birds! Long live the birds! How strange. That's not how I pictured birds to be. It's time. The hour has come for the King to marry the shepherdess. The King stands with the shepherdess under the red velvet canopy. He's savouring his triumph. At his side his dog stands as proud as a peacock. Powdered and bewigged like an 18th century page boy. It's a solemn moment. The Lord Chancellor kneels before his beloved sovereign and with a smile of rare obsequiousness he asks the usual question. Does His Royal Majesty take this humble shepherdess to be his wife? I do indeed. Do you accept. humble shepherdess, the immense honour His Royal Majesty does you in choosing you for his wife? Well, humble shepherdess? Yes, of course. What a question! You are now wed. They are wed! The Queen radiates happiness. Listen to the crowd proclaim with enthusiasm: "Long live their Majesties!" Long live their Majesties! Happiness and health! Prosperity! And long live our future princes and princesses! Thank you. You have done me a great service. It's our little secret. Madam, you are looking at the happiest man in the world. But not for long. Don't try to escape. All my birds are here, not to mention the rest of them. Don't be afraid, kids. Daddy knows what he's doing. What did I tell you, kids? When Daddy takes things in hand, everything works out fine!
