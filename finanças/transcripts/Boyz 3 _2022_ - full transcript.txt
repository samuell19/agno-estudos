Dhairya! If we want to go on a picnic with him. Then we will have to win some money. We can win money by driving on the wrong side of the road. Sitting on the bike. Without any clothes. While wearing only our underwear. Superman Dhungya is right behind you. Dhairya! Now we go at full speed. No matter what. Let's go! Whether it's a bet or just my pride. I always give it my best. We don't fear anything. Hey! Hurry up and qoute a price. I can't qoute a price until I ride it. Hey, take it easy. That's a bike. You don't spin everything you get your hands on. Tell me how much will you give us? Forty. I won't accept less than fifty. - Fifty? - Yes. Dhungya. The bike belongs to someone else but you want to give him attitude? It doesn't add up. Forty is fine. Since life has already been turned upside down. Then let's ask for at least 44. Hey mechanic! 44 final. It's a good thing we sold the bike, isn't it? Yes, we can keep the four. Why did you bring my bike here? To sell it. You guys are making a huge mistake! Shut up! You're the one who made a mistake. You got a low percentage but you still want a famous college? But I paid you guys all the money for that! The service charge and the GST was still pending. Now we're even. Get lost. What? Hey, bring us our money. But my money! My bike... Hey... hey wait! So, Kabir? What did you decide? But haven't we already discussed this before aunty? I won't go there. Your birthday is next week. You have to reach Karnataka on the day of your birthday. Yes, but I just need to sign it right? And we have already told them to courier the documents. Or else, you could call them here. I told them that. But they have a legal procedure, that is why you have to go down there personally. And the important part is, your mother left something behind for you. I think you should go. Well, if it is that important then we should both go. You have to go next week Kabir. I have a routine check-up with the Gynaecologist. I cannot skip that. And there is no need to worry about me, I have Alok. Listen, the place you are going is in coastal Karnataka. You will have a great trip, believe me. I can't go alone. For just a signature... I hate solo trips. Can I suggest something? If you hadn't called us, then we would have already left for our trip. Just as we were about to give our bike a kick... We got a kick of friendship. It didn't feel right to say no to Kabir and leave. I don't see Alok Prakashji anywhere. Forget it. Forget it. What month is it? The third. Not the calendar month. Your child. Seventh. Take care of yourself. In your condition you shouldn't travel anywhere. You should put up pictures of babies on the walls. And you should keep looking at those pictures. Because of that, the baby looks exactly like those pictures. When he was born they couldn't find any pictures in the market. All her mother saw was the monkeys on her roof. - Am I right? - Are you done? Are you done? Let's come to the point. As we said, we will stay with Kabir no matter what happens. Not just Karnataka, we would even be willing to go to Gujarat if he asks us. Forget Gujarat. We are even willing to go to Yevatmal. We would even sit on... Hey! The back of a cart. But we will still go. Directing them is easy. Just make these noises. Do you know how to drive a four-wheeler? I just... have a problem with the first gear. I can handle the rest. I only know how to ride a plough. In our village they tie him to a plough instead of a bull. Hey! We have to go all the way to Karnataka. And such a long journey cannot be covered by a single driver. At least two people should know how to drive. - Why are you so worried? - Exactly! I will sit next to you and learn how to drive! First! And then second! Third! Hey, move aside! Aunty? Aunty, move aside. - Reverse. - Reverse. Aunty is sitting there so we have to go from the side. "I don't like this exchange of money" "I don't like this exchange of money" "I don't need dowry Just give me your daughter's hand" Listen. There are a few conditions. Yes, we need a fully air-conditioned car. Karnataka is very hot. Are you done? Now listen. The journey will be over 736 kilometers. The trip will last 7 days. Pune to Kolhapur. Belgaum. Gokarna. Udupi, Murudeshwar and Yana. Come to me. I won't allow these pointless jokes on the trip. Hey, he says he won't allow it. And the most important point. There will be no drinking on the trip. Is this an NCC camp? If we knew this from the start, we would have gone separately. We wouldn't have joined you on this journey. No means no. Fine! We agree. This will be the last time we drink. From tomorrow onwards there will be no more drinking. What do you mean? It's time to drink one last time. - Cheers! - Cheers! Dhungya! Look, your dad threw a rock at my father. Cheers! Dads. Tomorrow we are going on a trip with Kabir. - Cheers! - Hey! You say cheers more, and drink less. Cheers! Do you miss your mother? I do. But I don't think of her as a star. You should, my friend. If you look at the stars then the darkness and loneliness don't feel that scary. Can I ask you something? We miss our dads even though they are gone. Don't you miss your dad who is still alive? It's done. The cab is booked. We leave early tomorrow morning. This trip is going to be amazing. Hey! What? Who are you? Look at how I stopped so close. I hit the brakes really hard. I just got some brakes installed. What did you use before that? Self-control. It's the best brake. And the car stopped? It stopped with a bang. Do you provide that service too? My heart would stop banging. No double meaning. Now hurry up and put your bags in the car. - Be quick. - No, wait. Why can't you do that? If I do that then you will have to pay extra charges. Are you going to charge us separately for turning left and right as well? Wow. Short people are very smart! - Can we leave? - One minute! Before we start the journey I need a selfie. What do you need that for? I will tell you that later. Let's take a selfie. Come here. - Let's take a selfie. - Move your hand. Smile please. Now I will introduce myself to you. I am... I am Sundar Gowda. Yuck! Don't say such disgusting things early in the morning. Where did you find this guy? Why does everyone react like this when they hear my name? Or is Gowda the problem? - Why does everyone... - Hey. Why do you have that bag full of coconuts? That is a part of your package. What package? - I didn't ask for anything. - Yes, it's from our side. We have to break a coconut before we start our journey. - Let's go! - Yes! Play a song first. Hurry up and play songs. - Did he feel dizzy? Is he dizzy? - He is spinning around. It's on the other side. - He scared me. - The gear is here. Hey Gowda! Not you, man. Excuse me, driver. Hey driver. You didn't tell us why you took a picture of us earlier. - You shouldn't talk to the driver... - Hey! You shouldn't talk to the driver from the backseat, it causes accidents. And if we get in an accident right now then the company needs a picture of the people who have passed away to identify them. Mande! But won't you die along with us? As soon as I know that an accident is imminent, I jump out of the car. Lean back. Do you see that spot? I got in an accident with four people there last month. They all died on the spot. What are you doing you idiot! They made a mistake. Forget it. It was a mistake. Hey, what do we do about this bag of coconuts? We should present coconuts to every God we pass on the highway. That's how you prevent accidents. And what if we don't? The probability of breaking your skull increases. Eyes on the road! Lean back. Do you see that tree? That was bent like this last month. I rammed into it so hard that the tree straightened up! Drive properly! Eyes on the road. Our whole trip is ruined. Enough with the nonsense, hurry up and play songs. We can only play songs for three minutes. Why? I can tell you after those three minutes are over. We could have died! What are you doing? - What happened? - Why are you sweating so much? - Take tissue paper please. - Forget that. How could you fall asleep with such loud music playing? See, when the sound is on full volume I feel sleepy... Talk with your eyes open! I feel very sleepy when the sound is on full volume. Every accident that I have been in was because of the passenger's insistence. But how do you survive if you are asleep? Well... This car only has airbags for the driver's seat. Wait, you mean... you mean... I am still awake! I got you good. Dhungya! Once, I am dead you will get everything I own. If you die, do you think I will survive? Look, it's Naru Bhondwe! Look at his car! Hey! That's the kind of car we should have booked. That's right. That car? That is a modified car. They charge 20 rupees per kilometer. And extra for the coconuts. I am going to break these coconuts on his head. Hey Dhungya, look there. That's the car! The car! Hey Gowda, stop here. Let's go. - Hey Gowda. - Yeah. - Aren't you hungry? - No. My work is my hunger. - Why you... - Hey! No. We'll be right back. This damn car that Kabir has booked feels like sitting in a tempo. No matter what, we need to get rid of this guy... Dhungya. Are you thinking what I am thinking? Then it is time to turn our thoughts into reality. Yes! Keep formula 39 in mind. Yes, I will handle Naru. You handle Kabir. - Over and out. - Okay. Myself Naru Madan Bondwe. 32 Megapixel. I am very rich. What is this? Kadaknath along with Bhadaknath? Turn around. Oh! It has been so long! It looks like the moon is out tonight. How is it going Naru sir. Where have you been? There are barely any of your posts on social media. What is wrong? - The thing is. - Yeah? Naru Bondwe is not addicted to social media. Not anymore. But social media has a craze for Naru Bondwe. Now. What are you saying? You should record what you say. - Record? - Yes, these dialogues are in demand on reels. They are, aren't they? The people in movies aren't stars anymore. Those are the real stars these days. But a star like you, sitting at this Dhaba and taking pictures with chickens. Does that look good? You would humiliate people in the middle of the street. And now you are taking a selfie with your own hands. Does that look good? But, at this simple and cheap Dhaba. How did you get here? Do you see her? - That woman? - Where? Her, with the red saree and the prominent borders. Look at that. That car. - That one? - Yes, that one. My father gave me that as a gift on my 18th Birthday. - Your 18th Birthday? - Yes, mine. College. Degree. 18. The math doesn't add up. Dhungya. My birthday falls on 29th February. I only count the leapyears as my birthday. - Yes, but it is going up. - What? Your age. But it's perfect. At this age, a man like you should drive that car. That's right! I agree. Hey waiter! Get this guy whatever he wants. He is my friend. - Do you want milk? - What? Warm milk with turmeric. Enough with the double meanings. Then what do you want? - Love. - You have that. Not that. Like the love you had for Swati. In a car like that... If Swati was by your side... But forget it. Let's not talk about that anymore. It was 100% certain that Chitra would have ended up with you. If Naru hadn't made that video go viral. But forget it. Let's not talk about that anymore. Instead of roaming around with your bodyguard if only you had Swati near your body to guard it. But forget it. Let's not talk about that anymore. It was the first time, that a girl had entered your life. You guys were a cute couple. You always had a smile on your face. And how long will you satisfy yourself with old photos? The head that goes up and down. But forget it. Let's not talk about that anymore. Whenever I see Naru, it feels like the scab on my wound has come off. Should I order extra rotis? Yes? No? Are you done? Hey Kabir! What? Naru Bondwe? I want my past returned to me. Tell your Dad to make a time machine for you. And go back in time. He just made fun of your father. Poor Mr. Madan. Don't challenge the Bondwe household Kabir! You are the only one who can take him down a peg Kabir. Even today, whenever I see him it feels like the scab on my wound has come off. Shut up. Let me eat in peace. You destroyed the full plate of love I had received. And you want me to let you eat in peace? I won't let you get away with this. - Hey! - Oh God damn. "Punch him in the face! Kick him in the back!" "Fight the way you can" "Fight! Fight! Fight!" Hey! Get up! "Fight! Fight! Fight!" Get up! Good job! "Fight!" "Fight! Fight!" "Fight! Fight!" Hey, listen to me. Two rotis with butter. Buttering you up is what I came here for. Naru sir has asked for his car keys. Immediately. You won't get them. Naru sir said that he wants two tandooris parceled and placed in the trunk. I got it! Get him! Get him! I will get him! Hey Kabir! We got the key. We got it. Let's go. Let's go. Here, take the key. Turn it on. Let's go! Let's go! Come on. Let's get out of here. Hey! Why are you still eating? They stole the car! Naru sir. I don't like it when people disturb me while I am eating. Do you want to share the jeera rice? Hey! What did I do wrong Naru sir? - Is Naru following us? - No, he is not. We taught that Naru a good lesson! Now we will tell him to keep yelling at himself. Stealing a car is wrong. He can file a police complaint against us. I think we should go back and return his car. This car can only be returned 7 days from now! That's right! No, I am impressed. Hey! I am impressed by Kabir's daring. He stole the whole car! Me? Wasn't this your idea? - Our idea? - Was it? - It was. - Holy shit! - What? - We forgot our bags in Sundar's car. Hey! What are you doing? What? How about this? Let's go back. We will get our bags and try to return the car as well. Yeah! Let's do that! And the whole trip will be ruined. That's unacceptable. Hey, come sit here. The view is amazing. I am coming. It's a great view. What do you think? We go back to return his car and he will just accept it? You didn't just steal his car. You beat him up then stole his car. You know what I think? Let's go on our trip. Then we will pay him what we owe him after we return. We will pay him? Do you guys have brains? 8 inches! 9 inches! Brains are measured in kilograms. You might do that. We measure ours in inches. The important part is, I am very hungry. - Me too. - Now come on. Drive. - Let's go. - Where? All the cash we had has been left behind in our bags. Can you just start driving? Don't underestimate me. Do your job. - Naru sir? - Yes. You didn't even let me eat my jeera rice properly. If I don't have a proper lunch then it ruins my whole day. You should have eaten something as well. I am about to lose my life here, and you think your lunch is more important? They stole the car right in front of you, how can you be so calm? Forget about our car. We came here by stealing someone else's bike. Let's not forget that part. If Madan sir finds out he will be very disappointed. If Madan sir finds out then he will grind me into a paste. Just a minute. Oh God. Papa! Papa! Papa! My dear friend, Papa. Let's chit chat on video call. Shut up! Shut up! You want to chit chat? Tell me, where are you? I am on your mind, Papa. You were on my mind since before you were born. What do you mean? I mean, you don't know how big is my mind. You don't. Right, mummy? Am I right? Hey, you idiot. Where is the back of the car? It's down there, papa. I said car, okay? No need to change my words. Otherwise, I will beat you so bad... So bad... Really bad. I am telling you. Now hang up! Naru sir! - Look there! - Where? Where is the car that belongs to our household? Not the car. A pan shop. I want some tobacco. Some day I will grind you up with chuna. Drive faster! I am hungry! You too? Me too. - Hey, stop the car. - What? - Aren't you hungry? - I ate already. You guys can eat what you want. He is doing this on purpose. Now stop! Hey, tell him to stop. Hey, stop! What is it? What is it? A happy wedding. Driver. We want to eat here. Yes! Let's go! What do you want? An OTP? - The family looks rich. - Yeah, they do. - Let's go. - I mean... Hey, doesn't shaking that make your hand hurt? No, this is the duty Tatya gave me. If you don't do that, it doesn't fall out. What is this? Hey! That's rose water. Fine, tell me. Is the wedding over? Or is it about to begin? No, it hasn't started yet. Why is she blushing? Are you done eating? First we feed the guests. Then the family. By the way, you guys... We are... who am I standing here with? I am standing in front of you, right? That means I am from your side. You are hitting on girls. So that must mean you are from the groom's side. Correct. Correct. Hurry up and tell us. Do we sit down to eat or do we have to stand? It's a buffet! See, I told you. We should buy a bouquet. We even passed one by on the way. But he said there is no need. Hey! A bouquet is what you give people. And a buffet is what you eat. You get your own plate. Which you hold in your hand and eat from. What? Why should we eat with a plate in our hands? What about the plates made of leaves? What about the plates made of leaves? - What about them? - Do you have them or not? What about the plates made of leaves? - Namaste. - Namaste. - What is your name? - Reshma. - It is a nice name. - I agree. - I am taking a papad. - Go ahead. Hey! So much? This is just for me. By the time you guys finish eating the bride will have a few children. Have people stopped going on honeymoons? Are the puris hot? Yes, we just pulled them out. Out of oil. I will take some. - It's hot. - Yes. I took two. What is this called? Malai kofta. I like kofta too. But these Koftas are a bit spicy. I agree. What is this dish called? Matar paneer. Is the paneer fresh? Yes, try pressing them. Dhungya! Come here. But... the paneer... - What are you guys doing? - Paneer? Dhairya has a full plate and so do you. You are dropping your daal. When the plate is already full, then it's bound to spill over. That's common sense. Am I right Reshma? I agree. She is great. - Listen to me. - Yeah? Hurry up and eat so that we can get out of here. Hey man, I won't leave until I eat the sweet dish. - Reshma? - Yes? - What is the sweet dish? - Halwa. - What did you say? - Halwa. Gajracha Halwa. She's great. I told you. These carrots have no decency. Am I right Reshma? Oh my. This is someone's wedding. Not a refugee camp! Why are you eating like starving homeless people at a stranger's wedding? Him and I have eaten a lot more than these two plates. Don't worry so much. We have eaten at a lot of weddings. Here, eat this. Hey! What is that noise? The people who are eating here free of cost are getting beaten up there. - Let's get out of here quickly. - They're sitting here. He was the one who said he is from the groom's side. Me... me... - I said that? - Yes! Tell us the truth, which side are you from? I am from Sangli and he is from Satara. Harshvardhan is our friend. Are you done eating? Yes, we are full. Then it is time to digest your food. If you want to do that, then do it to them. I am done eating. He looks like their leader. Get him. No Tatya! Hey Harshvardhan! Kabir this way! Let's get out of here. - Hey, what are you doing? - What the hell! - Get out. - Why did you stop here? Why are you getting off? What do you mean, get out? Oh man. I won't listen to you guys anymore. Enough is enough. Hey, get off me! Because of you guys I almost got beaten up. "We have eaten at a lot of weddings," he says! - We have! - Shut up. You guys have turned this picnic into a game of hide and seek. But why do you need to stop the car to say all this? That's right! Because we might have to spend the night here. Hey! What about a hotel? This is our hotel for tonight. It will be very scary. Hey! - Did you hear that? - Kabir? - Did you hear it? - Get in the car. - Let's go. - Let's get out of here. Hey wake up! Kabir wake up! There is a noise! Theres is a noise coming from the car. - Get out. - What is wrong? - What is it? - Listen. I can hear roaring. There is definitely a tiger in the car. - I am out of here. - Hey, wait. We should tell someone. - Who? - Do you want to gather the village? Instead of talking about it let's throw the car off a cliff. - Hey! - Hey! Listen to me. One of us has to take this risk. Yes. I will go check. All the best. - Kabir! - Hey, wait there. It is a tigress. Come back. Come here. Tell me, what did you look at to determine the gender? Hey. Who is she? Hello? Who are you? Hey! If you can hear it then you can't smell it. The wind took care of it. Where is it? Do we look like survey takers to you? We don't know. Go wherever you want. Both of you come with me. A girl just made a request. Don't just stare at my face. Let's go. This is the first time I have heard a request like this. Yeah. It was supposed to be a threat. But I accidentally said request. Now let's go. Do you want to come with me? Now turn your heads. Or I will turn them for you. Who is she? Why are we scared of her? She acts and talks like a thug. That is exactly what everyone calls me. Move aside. Put it away. That's ours. My name is Keerthi. I ran away from my wedding. And I won't go back home. Then where will you go? Do you see anyone else around? I will go with you. Hey! I saw how many plates you guys ate at my wedding that never happened, from the window. Even homeless people don't eat that much. - Hello, madam. - One minute! If someone cuts me off in the middle of my sentence then I thrash them. Understand? So, you are indebted to me for the eight plates you had. Will you give us a bill for it? No. I will take revenge. What does this girl want to take? - Exactly. - So? Where are you going? On a vacation. Vacation? Yeah. You look like you clean trucks, but you want to go on vacation? Hey! It's our car! We can do what we want. Stop giving us attitude! - Exactly. - What is all this? Be on your way! Fine. Then I am going straight to the police. Go ahead. I have to tell them how you guys kidnapped me from my own wedding. Then you can sit around complaining. Madam, listen to me. When? We ran out of money, that is why we went there to eat. You can tell me what the bill amount is, I will transfer the money to you. There is no need for that. I am coming with you. No, this is just a boys trip. That's fine! I don't discriminate. Hey, you can go do whatever you want, wherever you want. Don't get in our way. Let's go Kabir. Let's say... that I decide to sponsor your trip. Then? But we are headed to Karnataka. I don't care. I just want to come with you. Now hurry up and tell me your names. Dhungya! Dhairya. Did your family members not have enough time for a proper naming ceremony? Fine. You're tiny Dan. Tiny! And you're Rocky. It's a stylish name. I wanted to call you a black rock. It's just a little more respectful. She didn't ask for your name? You didn't give him a name. Won't you tell me your name? Myself Kabir. Do you think your English makes you smart? Get in the car. Let's go. - Let's go. - Sit in the back. Get up. How much longer do you plan on sleeping? Naru sir! I couldn't sleep at night because of you. Hey, you're worried about your sleep? Aren't we looking for the car, my boy? I understand what Madan sir means now. What? If you are too eager to celebrate your honeymoon then you end up with a child like Naru. Is this what Madan sir discusses with you? He trusts me. I don't tell anyone the things he tells me. Don't tell me. - Naru sir. - Yes? I am very hungry. Where are we stopping for breakfast? This is all that we have left. You are the only person I have ever seen consume so many bananas. I really enjoy eating bananas. You could have said this without turning your head. Get up! My leg is going numb. Get up! Are they red or black? My leg has gone numb, get up. Get up. I can't move unless you get up. Get up. Forget about your leg. If Madan sir finds out what happened to the car then you're going to be in trouble. Papa! Whose dad? Whose dad is so handsome? Hey, shut up you idiot. Where were you all night? No phone calls, no messages, nothing. Not even a dirty joke! I took the car into a forest Papa. Into a forest? At night? Yes. Madan sir, they took your car. What? What did he say? - What did he say about the car? - I drove it really fast! Really fast! - But papa? - Yeah. The car has such powerful lights! Of course! Do you think your dad's a nobody? If you enter the jungle with all the lights turned on. Then the tiger himself will come and ask you, "Oh! Is there another tiger here?" God damn it. Hey! When will you return? Not until I find the car. What did you say? Car? What? With this brand new car, I want to find a brand new path. I won't return until I do. Why do you need to find a new path? Search for a girl instead. Find her and give it your best shot. God damn. Look here. You can search for whatever you want. But return the car first. I don't care if you are not on it. I want the car. That car belongs to the Bhondwe household, understand? Now hang up. Hang up. Don't waste my data. Do you understand? Get lost! Whose dad? A papa like this... Get up! Get up! How is it going? I want jewellery like this. Please come in. - We're coming. - Namaste. Tell me. How can I help you? We want to sell her. It looks like you are going through a tough time. No, she wants to sell her jewellery. - That's right. - I see. - That's right. - Show me. Do you have a receipt? Uncle can you please come this side? This way. Yes, please come. Her husband left her. Don't look there. Look here. He told her to get lost, exactly the way she is. Taking her back would hurt her family's pride. Her life has become a game. But who are you to her? We are her friends. - Yes, and I am... - And this is her son. He is an illegitimate child. I am... her son? - Yuck! - Please come here. Please come to the side again? The thing is... she took playing house too seriously when she was young. This is the result. That has a fake marriage, a fake life and toy utensils. But the honeymoon was real. But don't you think she is a bit too young to be a mother. She might be young. But she has a lot of desire. Oh God. Listen to me. Forget about the rings. Will you buy him? The thing is, he is an illicit child. Plus he is ugly. How much more can I burden society? But sister, an offspring is a blessing from God. And blessings should be spread. Cut him up and pass it around. Mom! I need milk! I am hungry! - Get lost. - Hey, control him. Uncle can you please come this side? Come. She said no! I am hungry! Do you have some fevicol? Fevicol? I mean... We had to go through such poverty when he was born... that I had to feed him Fevicol with water. If he had fed on real milk then he wouldn't have grown up into this. But he is very... Sir! Sir! One minute. Please come this way. What is all this? The truth is that they have both been affected mentally since they were kicked out of home. And we came along to help them out. Just pay us what you can for the jewellery. May God bless you. Hail Jagannath. Hey! - Mom I want 500... - I will hit you. Take care of your mother, okay? Come. Please come to the side. To tell you the truth, I was just about to kill her. Now that you have told me to take care of her, I will do that. Hey mom! Let's go. Let's go. Please come again. Thank you. Let's go. Hey! It's me. It's her. Idiots. Are you not used to seeing a girl in shorts? You probably see them naked! Can't you be more polite? Hey! This is me being polite! You still haven't seen me being vulgar. Hold this. Me? You won't? Let's go. - Hey! Stop. Stop right there. - What's wrong, sir? - What's wrong? - We are innocent! What the hell? You ran off with the bride on the day of her wedding. Don't you feel any shame? Keep this in mind. You guys are in our custody. Explain it to them. What the hell? You ran off with the bride on the day of her wedding. Don't you feel any shame? Keep this in mind. You guys are in our custody. You can't go anywhere. That's what sir said. Her family members have been informed. They must be on their way. Oh, sir. I ran away out of my own free will. Nobody made me run away. No Marathi. Only English or Kannada. Sir! If you feel pride for your language then we will also respect our language. And if we can't respect Marathi in Belgaum then where can we? We should repect each other's languages. Why make it political? That's a very heavy dialogue. I don't think he will understand. He didn't deliver that dialogue for the police. He did it for the girl. He can't be trusted. Excuse me, sir. I am a law student. So you can't keep me here without any reason. It was my decision to leave my home and I don't want to go back there. And if you are such a follower of the law, go call my family. Oh, I get it. They all want to leave. Fine! Okay. Take their details. Give me all of your details. Then I can let you leave. Madam, please take her details. You! Come with me! Yelappa, get their details. Here? Fill up her details. Keerthi Saranjame. I came here of my own free will. I will leave of my own free will. You can speak Kannada? I know enough to make my own point. Naru Bhondwe, sign here. - Oh no, my name... - Is Narvirao Bhondwe. This is him. Just sign it. Kabir is just a nickname. You joker, you... They must have found the papers in the car. And they saw your dad's name. Madanrao Bhondwe. Sir, I have a question. The girl that just left. Short hair, long legs. It's about her, right? You can keep her here. Let us leave. You troublemakers! Hurry up and write your names. - Yes, hello? - Hello, Kabir? - I am sorry, aunty. - Look here. - My phone was switched off. - Where are you? - No idea where you are. - No need to panic. Yes, we got another car. We are on the way. Your phone is turned off. The car you left in has returned. - How would I know... - I will call you back. Hello Kabir? You're thinking about your family, aren't you? Don't think too much about it. - It's okay. - Get lost. I was wondering where I could get some alcohol. Hey! That is where we both agree. I was thinking the same thing. I heard you talking about alcohol, am I right? Great. So you know how to open a bottle cap? We thought you only knew how to make people's life miserable. Life needs some thrill and some tension. That is what makes life fun. We should feel that every once in a while. Yes, we watch that online as well. But will you truly never go back home? Even if I do, do you think they will roll out the red carpet for me? But why did you run away? Why should I get married if my family thinks I should? I should want to get married, right? In my house even our hair isn't allowed to grow freely. They are always hiding behind their pallo. In-laws want an educated girl. Not an open-minded one. She should answer questions but she should never ask them. The man can smoke beedis but the women must give birth? Is that fair? Now I have left my home, so I should leave these questions behind. Hey tiny! Open another one. But you just drank two... Looks like these restrictions were very tough on you. Restrictions don't break. They must be broken. - I need to pee really bad. - Me too. - Should we do it in the fire? - Let's go there. Let's go. Run. What do you think? There is a good chance he is going to fall in love with her. We won't allow that. Otherwise our trip is in trouble. - Let's go. - Hey! But there is only a single tent. Tentatively, this is the only one we have. But where will you guys sleep? - In the tent... - If we get a chance we can sleep with anyone. I mean, on a mat, with a blanket, on a bed. With each other! We will sleep in the car. In the car? - You go ahead. - Why should I sleep with the car? Wait for me. We are going there. - Let's go. - A scorpion might sting her. But at least one more person can easily fit in here. I really need rest! Hey! Come on. We are sleeping in the car. Kabir! Yeah? Good night. Hey! You should look at the sights with your own eyes. Not with a camera zoom. Oh... you guys? Where were you? We were looking at the same thing from a different angle. You idiot. She is older than us. More importantly, her marriage has been fixed. She isn't married. No need for you to fill that spot. We have to reach Karnataka on time. You remember, don't you? Hear me out. Let's return the money she spent on us. And let's be on our way. Yes! We stole a car. And found a runaway girl. It's very dangerous. Hey numbskulls. What are you doing here? Just chilling bro. We had to take a dump. Do all three of you go together? We are used to doing things like that. Have you ever watched a girl bathe? Ew! Gross! Yuck! We don't do such disgusting things. - Really? - Yeah! Why you little... You might think we are running away. But we will walk away. - Right! - Let's go.

You remember the plan, don't you? Our plan never misses the mark and we don't bend for anyone. Hey tiny Dan! Coming! So, what do you need from me? Listen, I want that photo. I am getting a phone call. Hello! Dhungya, I tried so hard, but it didn't connect! What? Phone! Where is the love of my life? - He is with me. - Hey! Dhungya took me out on a date. Go away! Move! I will hit you! Move! Get away from me! Dhungya, you are a cheater! Hey girl. She is crazy, don't listen to her. I love you from the bottom of my heart. I think of you as my husband. Oh my! But you are on a trip with some girl! What did I do wrong? - What am I missing? - Nothing at all! There are very few seats in the car. Where would you sit? I could sit on your lap! Do you think my lap is a JCB to bear your weight? What about me bearing your weight? The weight of your memories. - I understand. - Now tell me. - Yeah? - Who was the girl with long legs? That's Kabir's squeeze. Forget about it. Tell me, what should I bring for you from Karnataka? Will you bring coffee, tea powder, dry masala and coconut oil for me? Did your father not pay for rations? - Dhungya! - Mande. My battery is on low. I will call you back later. - Dhungya. - Yeah? - Don't turn your mobile off. - Why? I feel like my heartbeat has turned off. Mande, hang up or I will get angry. Listen. Okay. Okay! Sometimes it is better to not have range on your mobile. This is a very dangerous love story. - Yeah. - But hey, Kabir's love stories are a lot more dangerous. Yes! He charms a lot of women. Don't be fooled by his simplistic behaviour. He is a trap. That lures and traps women. Once he tastes blood. He doesn't let go. Hear me out. You should stay away from him. Be careful. It feels very bad to hear that about you. You shouldn't run after every girl you see. You should pick one. And fight for her. That's the problem with good-looking guys like you. You don't fall in love. You just shoot your shot. The two of them told you this, didn't they? Yes, I mean... Listen. If your luck goes along with your looks, that is the only way to find love that lasts. Hey! A shooting star! Didn't you wish for something? My wishes never come true. Try wishing for something. To make it come true, you need to put in effort. Just try crossing your limits. Yes, but that is not how I am as a person. Then try to be. Quite regularly, because we are looking for someone to love, we forget about loving ourselves. What is the definition of love for you? Just... to let it happen. Hey Keerthi. Let's start drinking. My brother! I will be right there. Cheers! But Dhairya. Keerthi sure can drink a lot. Yes, it is! This is worth praising! I am controlling myself because you guys are here. Tell me something. Where exactly are you heading? To the graveyard. I haven't decided. Rather, I don't want to decide. Yes, but we will accompany you for just a few more days. Once my task is done, we will return directly. Should we drop you somewhere? Don't you like my company? Do you guys have a problem with me? No! Absolutely not! Having the priviledge of your company only the lucky few can enjoy that. Exactly! Cheers! You are a birthday gift for our dear Kabir. Oh! Isn't your birthday coming? Then you should treat your friends to alcohol on your birthday. - Alcohol! - Yes! Don't you drink? No, I don't. - Then what do you like? - Chocobar! Ice cream. I want a chocobar ice-cream after my meal! Me too. You? I don't like such things. I didn't mean to say that you should drink alcohol. But you should make some mistakes at your age. You are very carefree. You should be more dashing. To hell with the world. And until you get tight, you can't form a tight bond. Because of that you will drink 90 ml for the sake of our friendship! - Waiter! Another bottle. - Waiter! - Waiter. - Now listen. - We do not sell alcohol here. - What? - No alcohol. - It is time for us to close. Pay the bill. Keep the change. Miss Keerthi Saranjame... Hey, don't keep the change. Give me the money. ...has been seen near Kolhapur. There is a reward of 100,000 rupees for sharing this information. Please contact us on this mobile number. Hey stop! Stop! Wait for them. - Ram Ram. - Namaste. You guys are dressed so well. - Marathi? - Marathi! Our car broke down. We have to go to a haldi. Since we were hired for it. We will very grateful if you drop us off there. Great! Come take a seat! What do you mean sit? There is no space in the car. Where will you sit? One minute! They will sit and so will we. - How? - But I have a condition. We should get some alcohol. That's right! We are going to a haldi. You might not get food, but you will definitely find alcohol. That's great! Come take a seat!

Naru sir! - Get the bike. You should have said that from the start. Let's go. Hurry up, let's go. Hurry up! Hey! Wake up! Tiger! Tiger! It's a tiger... God damn it... Hey, you shameless woman! If your husband knew that you snore so loudly he would have run away before you could. Hey! I am talking to you! Wake up! - God damn... - Good morning. Why you little... My head hurts. Hey! How did I get here? What do you mean? You were the one who drove us here. What the hell? Driving while intoxicated is a crime. And I don't even have a licence... This girl... I am about to beat her up... You lunatic! You were playing with our lives! Don't you... Hey! We should... We should confirm whether we are alive or not. Otherwise we might find out that we drove the car to heaven. Hey girl. Pinch me. Such a tight slap can only be felt on Earth. Let's go. Let's wash our faces. In that water? Let's go. You know what I think? Whatever has happened up until now. Keeping that in mind. We should come to a decision. Yeah! Otherwise, we keep forgetting why we even stole the car in the first place. Hey loudmouth. Hey! You freeloader. What are you trying to say? That I ruined your trip? - I am leaving. - Go ahead. Return all the money you owe me and I will be on my way. Come on, you want to talk about money between friends? - Hey... - No, no! - We owe you for two plates, right? - Hey! - Ten plates. - Eight plates. Then why did you say two? Whatever the number is! I am going to pay you for those and you can leave. And look here, this is our trip. And we don't want you here. Enough of this hide and seek. - Hey! - Hey! Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Get lost! - Moron. - Yeah. - Tell me Kabir. - Yes. The most obvious question is, can you tell us where you are going to get the money from? This is wrong. We stole this car and now you guys have sold the tires? We? You stole the car. Don't blame us. Me? You guys stole the key. Hey, that's enough. If it was that simple then you wouldn't have driven all the way here. Yeah, I mean. We could have put up with that Sundar. But we won't stand for these long legs. People look at the car not the tires. Do you buy shoes because you liked its sole? You look at the shoes! It's a good thing that we only sold the tires. I wanted to sell the whole car. - We could get... - Here you go. Just this much? This is how much you get for second hand tires. Fine. Then hand it over. Give it. This is a lot. Now you will give her this money? It's time to tell her how things are. Hey! Legs. Here. And the first thing you do is tell your mother that you are on your way home. Anna, take her home and give her a phone. Hey, only this much? Do you think I am a beggar? I won't go back home until I get all of the money you owe me. Hey, listen to me. We are wasting too much time. Hurry up and decide. Now that it is here, we have to face it. Understand? Amol Bhagastare is the way he is. Hey, let's go. Let's go.

Why do we keep dragging this headache along? I agree. We're already running late. The place where you need to go, you need to be there on the day of your birthday. Understand? What do you mean late? It's my birthday. My property. I have to sign those documents. Why are you guys so excited? Excited? Hey! Your aunt gave us this responsibility. That you should get there on time. - This is... - Kabir! Oh man! - Hey Dhungya! - She's here. Dhairya! Slow down. What is it? Such enthusiasm! Are you going home? Hey! Shut up! There are wrestling matches going on outside! There is a reward of 1 lakh rupees. Do we have a man here? Who can take part. Hey! No, no, no. If I take part in wrestling I will be split in two. If we get that much money then we will pack up our things and get out of here. Listen, I would prefer going back home in a truck or a bus. But I won't take part in this for money. We're doomed. Get ready to witness the wrestling competition that you have all come from various villages for. These participants have gathered from all around the world to participate in our competition. Listen to me. Your hard-earned body is not just for show. It should be used to shake the world. Kabir! Don't fight to win. Fight for the sake of it. Think of this wrestler as your life. Who stops you every single time. Now go fight. You have to fight to live. You have to fight against it from all sides. That tight feeling in your chest makes it hard to make decisions. And that is when we remember our mistakes without our awareness. That is how you learn the true value of our relationships. And then you fall into the habit of challenging life. Enduring it. Affairs? Madan sir has way too many of them. I have worked with him since before your birth. The car which Madan sir used before your birth. I used to drive that car. Even if he has one wife, he has several that he hasn't married. Several... What do you mean several? You have a step-mother in every single district. Whenever he says he is going on a trip. That's when you know. That means... That means my father has messed around a lot in my life. I know all of Madan sir's secrets. That is why Madan sir can never fire me. He thinks of me as his own son. - He just thinks it, right? - Yeah. Good. Papa? Oh, it's a call from papa. Just a minute. Papa! Hey Naru, you dimwit. Where is the car? Where is the car? Papa! All you care about is the car. I have to you freeloader! Because you don't have the car. Am I right? Papa, how do I explain this to you? You want to fool me? You want to fool me you little...? - What do you mean? - Hey! Hey! Show him the pictures. Look at that photo! How did they get a hold of the car? How? We are all together papa. Is that so? You're all together? Then why aren't you in the picture? I was taking the picture. I was taking the picture. Naru, if you lie to me one more time, I will belt your hide! They stole Madan Bhondwe's car? Look here, Naru. I don't care what you do. I want the car as it was. Completely safe. Understand? Where are you right now? I am in Karnataka right now. God damn... You told me that you would be back in the blink of an eye. Is your blink of an eye all the way in Karnataka! Is it? Don't worry, papa. I will get your car back with my own two hands. Exactly the way it is. If you don't then I will cut off both your hands like Thakur from Sholay. - Understand? - Oh sir. You should only break one of his hands. Otherwise he will have to hire someone to wash his back. Bye papa. I will turn into Thakur some day. But I am going to turn you into Samba right now. - So, Keerthi? - Yeah. Do you plan on ever getting married in your life? If one girl doesn't contribute to the growing population then it won't make a difference. Even after doing so much, what happens if they come and catch you. Hey, her father is rich. And she has a huge ego. We are the ones who will get in trouble if that happens. Hey! This son of a... Get off! Get out and return my car. - Hey, Keerthi. - Why you little... Hey! If you want a lift then just ask. Why do you want the car? This car belongs to Madan Bhondwe. Who is Madan Bhondwe? Papa! His. Naru sir. Naru sir. - Would you like some milk? - Get lost! Mummy. Private talk. Loudmouth. Go back. Private talk. Go back. Lower your gaze. Slowly. Naru sir. All we need is two days. We will go there quickly and then return your car. Hey. What do you mean return? Do you think it is a tourist car? Naru. You're spinning your wrist the wrong way. You should spin it this way. I will tell you what happened. We have an important deal with this girl. Do you want to join us at this meeting? Along with this beauty? That works. I accept this deal. Then, let's go. Naru sir. - What about me? - There is no space in the car. She says there is no space for luggage. Hey! I told you. There is no space in the car. - No, don't be offended. - She didn't mean it. Listen to what I mean. There is no space for me in my car? She said it! Look at her! - Naru sir. - No, no, no! I want the car! I want my car! - Your... - Hey. - Get lost. Idiot. - Can you shut up? We are negotiating. Why do you keep getting in the way? Naru sir, we are discussing it. We will figure this out. Don't worry. She is crazy. Just ignore her. How much more? How much... Who the hell is this? - Papa! - Yeah. - Look papa! It's our car. - Hi papa. Exactly the way it was. - I will show you the petrol. - Hey, shut up! The thing is that I am not decent. I am on one of my trips. Sorry, you were too late. No, I could just... And now, the estate is about to get another heir. Am I right? Now hang up you waste of space! - Get lost! - Papa... Hey! I will knock your teeth into your throat. I won't forget this. Hey! Get lost! Are you done? Why did you give him the key? Because it was his car and you guys stole it. Hey! We stole it for our trip, not for you. You keep increasing our problems every single day. Then you shouldn't have come to my wedding for a free meal! I would have taken someone else's car. You keep bringing that up! Are you crazy? Are you a child? Tell me? Look, the car is gone. It's time for you to leave. - Leave. - Hey Dhairya, don't. Leave! Forget this! Get lost. What was all that? What? Don't you think you guys behaved a bit too rudely with her? Have you lost your mind? What was her mistake? That she turned out to be worse than you guys? Don't we accept our friends the way they are? Just like I accepted you guys. Friends don't leave their friends in the middle of the street. I wouldn't do it. You aren't worth being calling a friend. - I am going to... - Sister! Hey! Hey long legs! Hey! You long legs! Hey. If I had a sister, she would be exactly like you. You and I have a lot of similarities. Except for our colour. Look. We get into a lot of trouble. Mess around. We speak like this. And the main part. Is that we can do anything for our friends. Now! Give me a sorry. Just say sorry. Hey get lost! She gave me a sorry! - Nobody ever takes me seriously. - Keerthi! - Lata! - Keerthi, after a long time. What were you thinking travelling alone... Hey! Are these guys harassing you? I was travelling with them! They helped me out on the way. No alcohol, only maadi. Hey! That means you guys helped me out. Yes, we did. Sorry, I thought you guys were thieves. We only steal hearts. Casanova type. Myself Lata. I am Rafi. This is Mukesh. The Lata and Rafi pairing has always given us hits. Who is this? You are Lata. I am Rafi and this is Mukesh. So who is left? - Kishore! - Right. I can see that! Hearing you talk has left my ears confused. Are you making fun of me? Hitting her...? Should we get in the car? Yes, let's go. - Let's go. - Let's go. Dhungya. It looks like Lata is hearing a different melody in her head. Is anyone hungry or something? Yes, I am something. I have snacks. What? Chocopie. Why does this happen to me every single time? Appa! Keerthi! You guys are so late. I tried calling you, but your phone was busy. We got held up in chit-chatting. Did you run away from home? I did. I ran away because I didn't want to get married. Hey loverboy. Where are the subtitles? What are they even saying? They are saying they love each other! But we will stick with Marathi! - Appa. - Yes. These are my friends. Namaste. Namaste. Namaste. Please come in. I am Lata's father. You're probably tired from the journey. Come in and freshen up. Sumati! Lata is home. Please come. You're welcome. Look at that. What is that? Come, I will show you. Please don't. Your house is huge! It's really beautiful. So big. Wow. I really like yours. Your behaviour! Hey, I also really like your... behaviour. Now let's go. Do you want to say something? Thanks. For making me fight my past. The truth is, I could never have imagined how this trip went. Don't think too much. We might have an accident here. You might fall in love. Is that a mistake? Aiyo! Careful Keerthi. I almost lost balance. Amma! Oh my! Go, Lata is waiting for you. Who is he? This is Kabir. I was with him. We had a lot of fun. I am sorry if she caused you any trouble. And thank you for taking care of her. Wow, you speak Marathi really well. Oh, my mother is from Sangli. I had a love marriage and came here. - But I also speak Kannada well. - Sumati! Yes! I am coming! That's how it goes. If I meet a Marathi person I can't stop myself from chit chatting. - Take care. - Yes. It's right there! Don't shout for no reason. Let's go. This bedroom is awesome. It's too hot. I brought new clothes for you to wear. Happy Birthday. Merry Christmas. Boys played well. That's right! You have to wear this. We are celebrating Ugadi at our house tomorrow. - Who is getting naked? - Oh no! Ugadi means Gudi Padwa. What is this? A shirt piece? Nobody is going to sew a shirt for us so late in the night. - Am I right Lata? - No! Dhungi! - Lungi. - Lungi! You have to turn it around and wrap it. It's great! That's scary. Wake up! Exactly! Are you done sleeping? Yes, I am. Is everyone else awake? Look, take this. You have to wear this today. Now hurry up. Both of you need to attend as well! Lata! Is the Aarti over? See, I told you. Look. I like this the most. Look at that. Now watch this. Watch this. When the wires of our minds meet each other. It leads to new relationships. Just like that, if the strings of our mind join together with this Veena. Then it produces beautiful melodies. Such deep dialogues one after the other? I could never do it. You have an amazing talent. You should cherish it. Have we met before this? He only meets girls on video call. Hey! I think we have been reincarnated. Hey Dhungya. By saying that you might be reincarnations it looks like her father expects grandchildren from you. Madam. - You are Keerthi's age, right? - Yes. Then when will you get married? Oh God! I want to do that before I get married! What is that? Love! Oh mummy. - Dhungya. - Yeah. It's game over for you. This should be in the center after you fold it. What? Oh sorry! Sorry! I am not used to it, so I start using my mother tongue. I wanted to say, is this the first time you are celebrating Gudi Padwa like this? Yes, we are. Tight. Stand up straight. How do you like Karnataka? It's the best. We are not used to seeing roads without potholes. This damn thing... Lungis are really good at letting air in. Now hurry up and come out. Damn this Lungi. This could lead to a horrible accident. I wonder when I can relax. My head. You always misunderstand! And then you guys say that I always make double meaning jokes. No, everyone says that I do that.

Look, there is no need to get so emotional. I think that you should wait here and let them go on their way. And if you really think that Kabir is in love with you, then you should tell him the truth. And what if I love him too? Responding to his feelings would be a huge mistake. Does that feel good? Yes. I miss my mother. What do your parents do? My mother passed away from cancer two years ago. Oh. And your father? He... is still alive. But not in my life. I don't know where he is. You know how it goes. Some people have never experienced certain things. I don't have the experience of having a father. Look here, son. Listen to me. We never lose people forever in life. Someone who has passed away lives on in our minds exactly the way we remember them. But... Your father is still alive. You should go up to him directly and ask him. You might not have your mother with you today. But you do have your father. Who knows? Maybe he is waiting for you somewhere out there. I will be right back. Kabir... Whatever happened was a mistake. What does that mean? I couldn't say what I wanted to say in Marathi. Keerthi... Whatever happened was a mistake. Whatever happened was a mistake. What happened? My mind has been a mess since yesterday. I told you already. Tell him the truth before creating a mess. You like her, what more do you need to say? And listen, I am sure she already knows that. But how do you keep falling in love over and over again? It's completely natural to feel this way. And I think I should tell him myself. Increasing someone's expectations and then destroying them is wrong. I don't expect anything. I like her. And if you guys think that is love then so be it. She is like a companion you meet on a trip. People like that can only be by your side for a certain time. Don't think of that as finding a companion. Where will you run off to? Where will you run off to? How much more shame will you bring to the family? What should we tell other people? Have you ever considered that question? Your mother! Have you ever considered how much she has cried for you? Plus you switched off your mobile. How should we find out whether you are dead or alive? I should consider myself lucky that I see you are still alive. If something happened to you then how would we be able to face anyone in Kolhapur? Tell me! People in my party are laughing at me. People said, "He can't even control his own daughter, how can he handle the district?" Saranjame. Calm down. We considered tying up your daughter and returning her to you, but then what would be the difference between us. Look at me, giving freedom to my own daughter while I capture someone else's daughter? That's not right. Mr. Saranjame. Your daughter is now all grown up. She will take responsibility for her decisions. Right? Say something Keerthi. If you don't speak today, then you will regret it for the rest of your life. Why does a girl from an educated family need to run away? Have you ever asked yourself that question? All you care about is your status. You never think about your daughter. Forget about your daughter, you hide your wife at home saying that she is very traditional. All of her hopes and dreams are now hidden behind that Pallo. Why? Because we respect women! You turned her into the president of the women's group for your party. And kept organising rallies. You turned her into a showpiece already, but now it was my turn. Dad, you did not want me to get married. You needed to show people that you are rich because you wanted that seat. Get up, Keerthi. Get up. Hit her. Go on. If hitting her is the solution then you should hit her. Why did she run away? For revenge? To challenge you? Have you ever tried answering that question? She ran away for her freedom. For her choices. I am sure you brought guns. Shoot her and put an end to this. As a father, if you had simply asked her that question. Asked her, "What do you want?" "Family," would have been her answer. Here is the key to the car. Go wherever you want to go. Do whatever you want to do. Because we already know. That you won't do anything that you shouldn't be doing. And this father, will always stand by your decisions. Just... Just don't break all contact with us. No dad. And yes. Please don't block our numbers. See you. Oh, yes. Who are Dhungya and Dhairya? Why? What's wrong? They were the ones who gave us this information. We have to pay them. - Run! Run! - Hey! Wait! See you. Even if Lord Shiva cut off Ganpati's head. Ganpati still accepted him as his father. You should try to do the same. Let's go. Bye. Welcome Kabir. The last time we met was when Gayatri passed away. But I did not have the courage to look you in the eye. You stood in front of me to show me sympathy. On a piece of paper, the word 'sorry', is all I could write. I didn't have the courage to raise my head and speak. Then you came close to me, put a hand on my shoulder and left. That cold shoulder still gives me nightmares. We did all of this to bring you here. I had no other options. That is why I gave Dhungya and Dhairya this responsibility. But... whatever happened at Lata's house... that was a surprise. Maybe... Destiny herself gave you that family to experience it as an exercise. Ever since Gayatri passed away I have hoped that you would accept me as a father. But I didn't think that you were ready for that yet, which is why I arranged this trip. If you didn't like what I did then I am... I am sorry. I am sorry. At the time of your birth I couldn't touch you. I am sorry. I am really really sorry. Please forgive me. From the day of my birth to yesterday, my father's name was not a part of my name. It was my mother's. Kabir Gayatri Panigrahi. I kept asking her and she kept refusing to answer. Because I was stuck asking the wrong questions... I had to suffer a loss. That is why I have now accepted my father. And I won't accept questions. Do you know why I keep falling in love? Is there someone in this world who would accept me for who I am? To check that. - But... - No need to explain. Just get out of here right now. - Look, Kabir... - We will handle him. You get out of here first. Without informing Kabir? Without meeting him? I feel very guilty. I am just going to... Forget about guilty. Hurry up and leave. Your decision probably gave Gayatri's soul true redemption today. Our true destination should always be home. And our first love should be our family. The person who has both could never be alone in life. Kabir, right? Yeah. Keerthi is here? Thank you so much man. You guys took good care of her. You are... I am so sorry. Vikrant. Keerthi's boyfriend. Nice to meet you man. Hey baby! If you think about your journey with her as a sweet dream and forget about it, then it won't hurt that much. Oh! We forgot to exchange contacts. It's better if we don't stay in contact. Whatever happened was a mistake. "Whatever happened was a mistake," that is what you wanted to say, right? Whatever happens, happens for a good reason. See you, tiny Dan and Rocky. Drink a lot of alcohol. Bye. Sometimes, some love stories exist only to remind you of them. Just like every year, even this year Kabir is left shaking it all alone. But for that, we need Boyz 4. Hey, come here. What is this? Why is it always me? Papa. Karnataka is very cold. - Is it? - Yes. The car's tires burst. It slipped. I am absolutely fine. But Tenya doesn't drive properly. That is why. - You are okay, right? - Yeah, I am fine. You waste of space! He was driving? Naru! Don't run! Don't run! Stop running! Then stop fighting! Papa! I will get revenge for this in Boyz 4.
