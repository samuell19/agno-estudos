Uncle, there's a lot of weight here. Let me put her down first then, you can scold me. I think she can answer your questions only in the morning. Who are you? Sunny. Boyfriend. I am a trainer at the Power House Gym. GK branch. Dimple and I met there. Upstairs would be better? Aunty... You are a body builder, right? So, body builder, now tell me, what did you do to my daughter? Had I done something, I wouldn't have brought her back in one piece. Out here, they are killed and stuffed into an oven. I respect you a lot, Sir. Dimple has told me everything about you, self-made man. To start from a garage and establish such a huge property empire is no joke. I wanted to meet you myself, but not like this. With a presentation of a plan for a chain of All-India gymnasiums. Anyway not now, you must be tired. I'll take an appointment and meet you later. I am your daughter's boyfriend. I won't do anything wrong. Trust me. Should I park the car inside? How will you go home? Bus, auto, I'll take anything, I left my bike at the gym. Take the car and bring it back in the morning, but there shouldn't be even a scratch on it. I won't get a scratch on it. Not on the car nor on your daughter. Good night sir, aunty. Good night, son. I had to brush four times to get rid of the Vodka smell. What if papa had caught me? And you? Walked out making a good impression, and making me look like a fool. Couldn't you stop me when I was chugging the shot? What happened? Why did we stop? Should I get off? What're you doing, Sunny? Where you going, Sunny? Bloody murderers, finished off my mother and father, you will rot in this house. Why are you throwing stones? Broke all the panes, you die. Shut up, you witch, you old woman. Netrapal! Netrapal! Oye, Rawat! Catch him, don't let him go. Run, Sunny, run. Start the bike. Go, go, go... Where are you running? Stop! Sorry. Sunny, tell me the full story. You've lost three kilos, you deserve a chocolate. -I am leaving. -Listen... You have enough problems of your own, why do you want to hear mine? You call me your girlfriend, can't even share your problems with your girlfriend? That house is mine. Yours? My grandfather built it. Papa was born there. When my grandfather got transferred, he put the house up for rent. And when he came back those... Those assholes did not leave the house. My grandfather filed a case. Fighting the case, he died first, then my father and then mother, along went the entire bank balance. After three deaths the court ruled in favor of the tenants under the Rent Control Act of 1947. Now, they pay only 1,500 rupees rent for such a big house and I pay a property tax of 60 thousand every year and if I don't pay up, I get an arrest warrant. I am sorry, I didn't mean to grumble. Your pain, my pain. No, you look best laughing. Don't get involved in my tears. We will all laugh together, and make those MFs cry. How? Good evening, Dimple ma'am. Papa, help. There is big crisis. Dimple? Mr. Kamal is here. Uncle, can you step out please? Mr. Chaddha, what's this nonsense? Two minutes please. Not nonsense! I am Dimple Chaddha. This shop is named after me. I am telling you politely to wait outside, once our meeting is done then, you can have your's. Okay? Happy? Out! Papa, help us. -Us? Means? -Me and Sunny. Ours. Get Sunny back his bungalow. Sunny has a bungalow? Yes, on Barakhamba Road. Sunny owns a bungalow on Barakhamba Road? Where do you think you are entering? Throw this out. Throw this out as well. Take this, break this, come on. Uncle can I have a look inside? Of course, it's your bungalow, you are the landlord. You are the king. -Dimple! -Yes, mom? No issues, have a good look. It's a proper bungalow. Nice, isn't it? It's cute. It has an old world charm. Come up stairs, there's more. Yeah, lets go. -From where? -Come from here. We are going upstairs. Papa made this map himself. He was born in this room. Papa Sunny's father was born here, it's so exciting, isn't it? But the condition of the house is not very exciting. What difference does it make, uncle. I am sure, papa and papa's papa are both thanking you from there that you made it possible for his son and his grandson to stand here. Son's son. You won't be standing for long. It's best you sell this while the market is still piping hot. No, uncle. This house has an emotional value. Two crores, it will fetch, just like that. With a constantly leaking roof and these seeping walls, you will always need security here. How will you manage on your salary? Listen to me. Sell it. Buy a four BHK flat for one crore in a suburb. Either in Gurgaon or Greater Noida. And with the rest, start a gym. You can't be a trainer all your life, can you? Isn't it a plan? Pammi, get the bag. Now where will you run around selling-buying? Let me take the responsibility. No, I can't trouble you. Dimple's problem, my problem. Twenty Lakhs advance, rest 180, after the deal is done. Done? Done. Superb! Will you keep staring at the cash or will you hug me? Not her, me! Bye, Sunny. You don't care whether it's a friend or an enemy. You've taken his eight crore worth property for just two crores! He is our Dimple's boyfriend! So he's not going to be a boyfriend forever. Papa! I mean, soon he will become our son-in-law. And everything will be his. Right, dimple? What is this nonsense, Sharma? It's not nonsense, it's a warrant. You entered my house and beat up my people. Arrest him. You say it's yours and I should believe you? Mr. Sharma I've bought it legally, from Sunny Singh. An advance has been paid, the entire paper work is ready. I even have the original map made by poor Sunny's dad. -Only the registration is left. -Registration is not possible. -Why is not possible? -Not possible because, a family feud has been going on since my father's death. A stay order has been imposed on that house. If you have a map, I have the original documents for this property. I don't see any Sunny Singh in these. I think he's tucked you up. -Listen carefully. -Yes, sir. Call Surti... Tell him my bail should be done before sunset. If I have to spend even one night in jail, believe me... I'll have everyone buried in this market itself. -Call right away. -Yes, sir. Papa, where are you going? Papa, what happened? Sharma Uncle? The Urban Ministry's secretary happens top be my brother-in-law. He'll usurp my bungalow. Put him in there. Papa, don't be scared, I'll be there with Mummy and Sunny. If you meet Sunny again, I'll break your legs. No meeting Sunny. Let's go, Sharma. Why Papa? No, he was Anup's substitute. He was to leave on Friday, but he left three days early. But Anup will be back on Friday. But it looks like Sunny really suited you. You're looking fit. What're you scared of? Give your dad that picture of Sunny's, which you took. Dad will kill me if I even step in front of him. Thank God, he got out on bail today, or else it would be my neck. I am sure even your dad wants his 20 lakhs back, right? Give it. Your dad will find him. He's not going to get us married even if he finds Sunny. Papa is going to kill him in the center of the market. Now a Sunny-Dimple match is impossible. You're impossible. You're still dreaming of Sunny. It's Papa's fault as well. Sunny hatched a clever plan. But papa should have been a bit smart too. Why was he duped? I love him, Gurmi. You are crazy, Dimple... At times, one has to lose to win. And that player is the ultimate winner. Your attention, please. The Indian Airline flight to Mumbai, IC 708 is ready to depart.

We had orders to get the best. Of course, you had to get the best. Best in the right price! Did someone put a gun to your head to get it at the seller's price? You are the buyer, you fix the price. Buyer is king. -I am sorry, Raina. -I can't take the blame for every mistake. The bosses will punish the culprit. So be ready to be fired. If you speak to him, he won't fire us. Please cry in your cubicle, not here. Okay? Listen, guys. Market is tough. Smart ones stay, idiots perish. Smart or idiot, you choose. The rest is all good, thanks. Sir. Yes, Sir. Coming. Fire the interior designer. -Sir. -He has left such a huge blank space. I want Hussain's horses on this wall. At any cost. You have an impressive reputation, Raina Parulekar. You can make the impossible, possible... So will there be a Hussain on the wall on the inauguration day? Yes, Sir. -Yes, Nikhil Sir. -What about the Hussain? They are quoting five crores. That's too expensive. I know, I am trying other art galleries as well. Okay. Yes? Ma'am, the painting you asked for will be available next month. -No, no, no, I need it in 72 hours. -But, Ma'am... What will I do with it after a month? Put it in my bedroom? Will an Anjolie Raman do at the same price? No, Anjolie Raman won't do. I need a Hussain. Only a Hussain. Moron. Careful. Move it, what's going on? Lady, lady... Relax. Please. I am honking at the truck, you stick to your business. The truck is mine and so is the business. You look like the transport type guy! Now move it, I am getting late. It won't move till everything is off-loaded. Keep honking. Careful! Careful! Careful, man. Please. It's not a painting, it's a Hussain. M. F. Hussain. It's a masterpiece. Do you know how much it's worth? If something happens to it then... -Carefully. -Yes, Sir. Just be careful! Easy does it! One second. How much is it? Five bucks for 100 grams. Eat in or take away? Okay, I know it's not peanuts. It's art, creative and all that, but how much are you selling it for? It's an exhibition for art lovers. Over here? My gallery, Indigo. The opening is this evening. Invitation. Come over if you are interested in art. If you want to buy spicy peanuts, then the Mithibai College has the best chutney. Jerk! Indigo... Indigo... Indigo... Deven Idiot Shah. Market value Rs. 80 lakhs. Not for sale! Why not for sale, Mr. Shah? Why not? Looking for the price tag? Five rupess for 100 grams, freshly baked. Ninety lakhs. Deal? And I thought you were genuinely interested in art. It's to decorate the office. What? I like honesty. I hate fake. It's impossible to buy. Nothing is impossible. Honestly. The painting isn't mine to sell. It's borrowed from the Suri brothers for the exhibition. -Mr. Suri Steel and Power Suri? -Yes. Manoj and Maneesh Suri. Joint owners. Couldn't you have said that earlier? You wouldn't have been here then. You would've found someone else to flirt with. I can set up your meeting with the Suris. If you can convince them, you can have your painting. And you, your commission. It's a hard-earned commission, no cheating. Raina Parulekar. Deven Shah. Call me Dev. Deven, if possible it would be better to have a meeting with the older brother. His position is weaker, he will surrender faster. Surrender! To Raina the tigress. The meeting should happen tomorrow. The day after the painting has to be up in office for the opening. At such short notice, only a phone conversation will be possible. Phone is good. Bye then. Sir, I need the financial stats of Suri Power and Steel. Buying-selling ratios, last quarter. Forget about the Suri's, Raina, we are two days away. Concentrate on the Hussain. I am focused on that, sir. Hello? -Is this Raina Parulekar? -Yes. I am calling from Mr. Manoj Suri's office, to inform you that Mr. Suri is not interested in selling his Hussain painting. Oh, but we are offering more than its market value. I don't know ma'am, it's Mr. Suri's decision. I am just conveying the message. Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. Can you let me talk to him please? My boss's orders, I have to get that painting. Please? Okay. Only an employee can understand another. I will try. Okay, hold on. Hello. Manoj Suri here. We will not sell that painting. Hussian is the pride and glory of Suri Steel and Powers. Hussain is the life of our company. Mr. Suri, the market value of the painting is Rs.80,00,000. We are ready to pay 90. You are ready, I am not. One crore. It's an insult to Mr. Hussain. One crore twenty, final. You are insulting me... It's your younger brother who is going to insult you. What do you mean by that? You and me both know that your brother wants to take 51 percent of the shares. So he can sideline and eventually oust you. There's bound to be a split in the company and its assets. Will the Hussain be yours or his? Who would've thought that one's own brother would deceive them? If we pay you half in cash, the rest 60 Lakhs by cheque... with receipt, which will officially make the price 60 lakhs. Half of which will be your cheating brother's part, making his total 30 lakhs, and your share 90 lakhs. I hope causing him a loss of 90 lakhs will be give you some sort of... How do say it? Peace. Yes, it will give some peace. So, deal? Yes, but give the Indigo broker, his commission on the full price. Why should he incur losses in my fight with my brother? Mr. Manoj Suri, you are a very nice man. I know, I know. Anyway, take the painting from the gallery, give the boy his commission, and also hand him my suitcase with cash in it. Get the cheque sent to my office by speed post. Are you sure? Hand over 60 lakhs in cash to Dev? He is a simple chap, he won't even open the bag. Okay, bye. Yes! Yes! Yes! Careful, guys please. Tigress Parulekar, so you made Mr. Suri surrender. Worked that magic. Very nicely done. There is no such thing as magic. Honest, hard work. -A cheque for your commission. -Thank you. And this briefcase for Mr. Suri. It will reach him. All clear between us? All clear. Cheers to Raina! To Hussain! Since his death, it's become more precious. Sir, Mr. Suri... -Manoj Suri? -Yes, sir. Please tell me, when are you getting here? Forget that, first tell me, how did you set claims on my Hussain painting? We never had any deal, what rumors are you spreading? Hello... Call Raina. Now! -Yes, sir. -The painting is not a fake, Sir. Mr. Suri is confused. Mr. Suri is the owner of Suri Power and Steel, not a desperate manager level employee who will use cheap tricks to get ahead. Not a cheap trick, Sir. I only followed your orders. The orders were to get a genuine painting, not a fake. How will I justify such a big scam? Not a scam, Sir. Mistake. Really? And who will prove it's a mistake or a scam? I'll prove it, Sir. You'd better, Raina Parulekar. You'd better. At times, one has to lose to win, and that player is the ultimate winner. Raina Parulekar, someone has conned your company and sold a fake Hussain painting to you. How are you feeling? There is speculation that it's not a con but a scam, and you are involved in it too. Do I look like a scamster? Am I a thief? I have a B Tech degree from IIT, and an MBA from IIM. Raina, don't, let the lawyers handle it. No, Sir, let me speak. I am an honest employee of Synergy Communications. I love this job and my company. I will never con my bosses, I've been conned. A man called Deven Shah has conned me. Surely this is not his real name or his first con. For him, it was just a way to make a quick buck. But for me, my honesty, my identity, my commitment, my job, my future all is at stake. I am going to track him down, recover the company's money, get him arrested and prove that he is a criminal and I am innocent. Yeah? Raina from Mumbai? Who is this? Dimple from Delhi. You have the wrong Raina, I don't know any Dimple. Parulkar isn't it? Raina Parulkar. -Parulekar. -Yeah, the same. Saw you on the news, got your number from the channel. I have strong feeling the guy who conned you conned me too. Yes, Raina. Yes, Deven Shah is Sunny Singh. Did he also make you his girlfriend and dump you? I am stupid, but not that much. You mean I am stupid? No, no. I mean... I didn't let it get to that. But he conned me for 60 lakhs. Lol! 60! He could only get 20 from me. You are more stupid than I am. Okay, I am more stupid than you. Okay, listen I am getting another call. I'll call you back. Hello? Hello? Is that Raina? Yes? Can we talk? I hope you're not in the office? No, I am at home. Have those horrible people fired you? Who are you? Questions upon questions. Where are you calling from? Lucknow. My name is Saira. Saira Rashid. Six months ago, a man named Iqbal Khan cheated me of 10 lakh rupees. and he disappeared thereafter. I'm not sure if Iqbal and your painting guy are the same. But if you could tell me more... Saira, I am going to send you a photo. Have a look and then we'll talk. -Hello, Raina? -And Dimple Chadda. Saira, I am Raina, and on the other line is Dimple from Delhi. Dimple, did Iqbal con you as well? Yes, as Sunny Singh. Did you get the photo? Yes, it is Iqbal. I took it. It's useful isn't it? You are really smart Dimple. Raina? Did you hear that? Saira, tell me the truth, did he make you his girlfriend as well? If you give Saira a chance to speak then she can tell us. Tell us, Saira. Immediately after my graduation, I was married off to Adil. You're married? Love marriage? Arranged. After three years Adil died in an accident. His parents are just as nice as he was. I've been with them for the last two years. So when did you meet Sunny? While going to my shop in the morning. Stop, stop. No hell would break lose if you stop. Hey, don't touch them. I picked them. I missed my bus. You can't enjoy them. No way. They look so yummy, but taste like poison. Ticket! Pass! Don't say it, show it. What happened? Has the pass failed? I left my purse at home. Show your pass, or buy a ticket. I don't have money, I'll give it you tomorrow. I always take this route. Madam, get a ticket or else get off. Should I buy one? Ticket? I am already insulted. I don't want to be a beggar now. Return it tomorrow, I will also take this route. Hazrat Ganj. Two for Hazrat Ganj. Even my business is that side. Thank you. Mention not. One for Hazrat Ganj. Give it to him please. And yours? Take it. She bought it. Thank you! Mention not! He had done his research. From which bus stop, and at what time I take the bus. Which area the shop is in, what time it opens, everything. I want pink color salwar along with this. By buying of the ticket, and the thank you, the mention not, he got familiar with me, and soon reached our lane. Hey, listen. Shambhu, take the payments. Hey, Mr. Suitcase? Blue shirt? My mind had glazed over, I smiled and led him right into the shop. Royal Cloth Merchant. Our shop's name. My name is Iqbal. I am Saira. What's the rate? Rupees 450 a meter. He even chose the right time to enter the shop. -Greetings. -Greetings. He knew my father-in-law brings lunch at that time. Just as father entered, he began showing off his knowledge about fabrics. -Khan, Iqbal Khan. -It took him hardly ten minutes to have my father wrapped around his finger. Tie-dye is popular here? Yes. There's an entire colony for the tie-dye. Which way would that colony be? It's through the by lanes, you'll get lost if you go on your own. I would've shown you, had the property tax guy not been coming. Saira why don't you show him? Me? Yes, go ahead. I'll manage here. Okay. While he was showing his fake sympathy and kindness, I was melting like an idiot. Cold drink? Ice cream? Shall I show you something? God, finally the Pandora's box is opening today. What is this? Real intricate threadwork Zardozi. I've never seen such intricate work before. We have our own workshop in Bareli, traditional weavers. As there are no sales in smaller towns, my friends said that Lucknow would be the right place. Now, the dealers here show interest but not cash. I am almost through with the money I had. Back home my mother and both my sisters are worried. I'd better head back home. Isn't it exquisite? What are you quoting for this? Four rupees a meter. No one is ready to pay even 400. Such swindlers! And they will sell it for a 1,000. Your losses won't be a profit to us! But 400 is too low, my friend. I'll give you 500 rupees a meter And I'll place an order for 5,000 meters. I'll give you ten lakhs advance and the balance of 15 lakhs on delivery. Agreed? Poor father, he struck the deal blindly for me. Hoping that this friendship would turn into a relationship, and end my loneliness. Have some sweets to celebrate. Wow. The following day, father gave him 10 lakhs, cash. He promised to return in two weeks' time. I feel like wringing the Zardozi Saree around his neck and hang him in the city center. That's provided we find him. You guys have his photo why don't you inform the police? If he gets to know the police are looking for him he will go underground, and we will never get our money. No. No police. Look, I have a plan. Everything will be possible if we join forces. Why don't both of you come down? It's impossible for me. Papa has imposed various bans on me. Fine then sit in your homes, and let more Sunnys and Iqbals make fools out of you. Bye. Go. It has been bothering me too. But then I didn't say anything thinking about Adil. I was wrong. But even if Adil is not here anymore, you are. No, you are not going on any trip. Gurmi, Puchki, Choti are all going. Well, no bodybuilder in their house has swindled them of 20 lakhs. If I have done something wrong once it doesn't mean that I'll be doing it all my life. Even you have made many mistakes. Weren't you conned in the Bhatia shop deal, for 12 Lakhs? The Pancholi Bunglaow, the Preet Vihar flats, but did you shut down your property business because of your mistakes? You've grounded me! I never thought you'd play such a double standard game with me, Papa. Let her go. Dimpy, will you travel business class or economy? Raina! Dimple? Come on, I've been waiting for so long. But I was right here. But you didn't come in front of me. Okay, sorry. Nice glares. Aren't they? Are you still in mourning for Sunny? No. So why black-black? I like black. I like colour. Suits you. Saira's flight arrived before yours. She hasn't even switched on her phone yet. I am Saira You run a shop? Yes, Dimple. Hello, Raina. Hello. Let's go. How did you guess I was Dimple? You're very special, people know you instantly. Okay so how will we get our money from Sunny? From Iqbal. Dev, Iqbal, Sunny whatever from that Bloody Scoundrel. Idea. His name will be Bloody Scoundrel to avoid any confusion. To extract money from the Bloody Scoundrel we will con that con. Con what con? Con means to cheat. He cheated us, now we will cheat him. We will plant a bait in front of him. Our bait will pretend that she has a great investment proposal to multiply money. Bloody Scoundrel will invest his money in that, and through our bait we will get our money back. Simple. Simple? Who will be 'The Bait'? There is one. I have someone in mind. Through the thorns Pluck the roses Snip the dreams, From te tree of snoozes Through the thorns Pluck the roses Snip the dreams, From te tree of snoozes Many a tales of hopes to look Pick any story and leave the book Faded are the colors of life Follow your heart all the way through Till it changes your point of view Let out your passion Let out your passion Let out your passion Let out your passion Let out your passion Pat a little Awaken your lazy dreams It's your play Fight through the difficult way What will be, will be Don't worry you will see Restrain not your dreams Ride the waves of destiny Just sail out your boat and go Even your stars will shine and glow Let out your passion Let out your passion Let out your passion Cabinets up, cabinets down.

All expenses paid. What if he is a psycho-rapist? He is not a rapist. Actually, he is very nice. He is only interested in money. Cold calculated unemotional. What pain his con causes is no concern to him. I am doing my job well... Getting paid well, no one to check on me. Con a con? -Let it be. Excuse me. -Fine. I will do it.

Patience, sweety. You're Bournvita. Okay, now the three numbers have the same caller tune. At times, one has to lose to win, and that player is the ultimate winner. So what? Most people choose songs. Very few ring tones have dialogues. Now you get a list of all prepaid numbers with this caller tune. Let's see how ultimate a winner you are. Raina Ma'am, you are wicked! Ladies, wake up. Here is your list, it has seven names. All the best, I hope in the Ladies vs. Bloody Scoundrel, the Scoundrel loses and the ladies win. Thank you, bye-bye. Ready? Bismillah. First name, Amandeep Chandigarh. 9915682870. It's ringing... Hello? Amandeep you're a guy or a girl? You're an aunty or an uncle? -Your dad's the uncle! -Dimple. No speaking. Just listen. Takes all sorts. Next. Hello? Who is it? Shailen Sharma, Bilaspur. Has the consignment arrived? Diego Vaz. Goa. I'll do it, she can't even dial. Never gets through. 9850008326. So what? You didn't get through the first time either. Next. Where are you hiding, Scoundrel? The fourth guy Dimple called is calling back. Diego Vaz. Hello? The Bloody Scoundrel is in Goa! This is your planning? Had we told Papa, he would've booked us into a five-star hotel. Miss Dimple, I wish your papa had financed this entire operation. We would've stayed in a five-star hotel, hired a Mercedes. Thank you. But I'm very sorry, this is all I could manage with my small savings. Ishika's fee, food, transport, everyone's tickets, chips, cold drinks. But it's not an obligation, right, once we get money from that Bloody Scoundrel... Volume! When we get the money from Bloody Scoundrel, you will take your cut first and then give us ours, right? If we get and when we get. And what if we don't? Don't be negative. It's going to be fine. God willing. Wow, what a great bed. The two of us can fit in easily. That room. Why? Aren't we roomies? Sweetie, first you stop snoring then you and I can be roomies. Till then, Saira and I are here. Okay, rules: This is my friend Sasha's house, not a hotel. We have to leave it in a better condition than it is now. The maid comes in the morning to clean, but no one says anything in front of her. The rest of the work will be divided equally between us. Okay? Why didn't you specify earlier that we'd have to be maids as well? Change the SIM card. Don't even know how to change a card. That's why you're still a Manager and not General Manager. At times, one has to lose to win, and that player is the ultimate winner. Yeah? Hello, I have a problem with my laptop and I was wondering when I could come by to get it fixed. Wrong number. Hello, hello Ashley? Ashley Rodriguez? I am not Ashley Rodriguez. I am Diego Vaz. But my friend gave me this number and told me you're very good with computers. You live in Cavelossim, right? I don't fix computers, ma'am. I work at the water sports shack at The Pallazzo. If you'd like to... Let's go. What a body. Oh, excuse me. Yes, ma'am? Can you give me a dry towel, Mr. Shankar? -Sure, ma'am. -Thank you. Come on, come on, come on. Keys! The keys. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Dimple, you can drive, right? -Drive? I'll fly. -Open it. Just look. The result of all his crimes. House, fridge, microwave, TV, he has everything. Yet he seems lonely, not even a soul to share a meal with him. How do we know there is no one? No! He's never getting into that trap. Then what is he is doing here alone with all our money? Looking for another victim I guess. Had he found one, he wouldn't have been in Goa. Hello, Ishika. We found the Scoundrel. Take the first flight out! Okay. So the Bloody Scoundrel, operates from The Grand Pallazzo. You will be staying there as well. The story is, you're the daughter of Himesh Bhai, the owner of King Motels and Resorts, USA. -Me? -Ishika Patel. American citizen? Fake one. We aren't really taking you to America. This is their website. -Real website? -No, we've made it. Himesh Bhai fake, Ishika fake, Kings Motel and Resorts fake. But if you Google it, a genuine-looking website will come up. Impressive homework! So Himesh Bhai and family, billionaire American citizens. Your father Himes Bhai Patel is the USA Motel King. Owner of 240 motels and 60 resorts. You have three brothers, all older, you're the only and the youngest daughter. You're in Goa to set up your own business. -Welcome, Ma'am. -Thank you. Have a pleasant stay. -Thank you. -Welcome, Ma'am. Thank you, Ma'am. A man named Shankar works here at the bell desk. Yes, Ma'am. A friend of mine stayed here last month and Shankar helped her a lot, can you send Shankar, please? I can help, Ma'am. He is Shankar, I am Bhola. What do you want ma'am? Ice, hash, sugar, grass? Shankar! Okay, Ma'am. Thank you. This is like a 2BHK flat. My feet hurt. The Alps. And complimentary! Ishika Patel, Patel. I feel good. Fifty-two inch. -Yes? -Hello, Ma'am. I'm Shankar. You asked for me? Right. -Shankar. -Thank you, Ma'am. I need a list of all the property dealers in Goa, -the best and most reliable. -Yes, Ma'am. The ones who deal for less than a crore rupees, don't bother including them. It will be a waste of time. Will get it done. The list will be better if I know what kind of property you are looking for... Flat, bungalow, office, show room? For a restaurant. My restaurant. I need land for that. -My card. -Thank you, Ma'am. Sorry my dad's card. -Here, this is mine. -Thank you, Ma'am. Call me on my Indian number once the list is ready. -Okay, Ma'am. -Okay? Now get to work. Thank you very much, ma'am, thank you very much. Have a nice day, ma'am. You too... Boss, I found a huge fish. Ishika Patel. Excuse me, one minute. What're you doing? I'm going to use this. One minute, I will not take long. -I will not take long. -Okay, where's the manager? He was checking Ishika's dad's website. He's hooked. Ishika. -Wohoo... -Hello, Ma'am. This is the property dealer's list you asked for. -You got them? -Yes, Ma'am. -Superb. -Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Shankar. My pleasure, Ma'am, and this is your ride, Ma'am. -I like it. -Yeah. -I love the color. -Yeah. -Please, Ma'am. -Thank you. -Have a nice day, Ma'am. -Thank you. Dimple, stay back. Stay back. He's still not here. Where is he? He's just been watching for three days. Why isn't he attacking? Do you think he has suspected something? When will he stop looking so handsome? All his luxury is thanks to all our money. Don't worry, won't last too long. Single malt, double. Sure, Sir. -Yes? -Bill our drinks to this. Okay. Jerks. Settle my tab please. -Sure, Ma'am. -Thank you. -Ma'am, your card is blocked. -What? How can it be blocked? Hello? Yeah my card number is 4541 9823 3318 0680. How can it be blocked you block-head? Unblock it. Unblock it now! Twenty four hours! What will I do without my card for 24 hours? You know I will sue you for this. Raina! He is not even looking at me. Drunkard's just chugging it down. I am paying cash and leaving. Okay, Bye. Hi, so I'm just going to pay you by cash, how much was it? It's okay, ma'am, your bill has been settled by your friend Which friend? Excuse me! Since when have you become my friend? Since the white shirt and blue jeans became your enemy. Listen, I don't have time for this. So just tell me how much you paid for my bill? Blue and white paid, not me. Bartender said you... I just pointed to the blue and white's card, the bartender was so hassled he didn't notice whose card had I pointed to. He presumed it was mine. Simple. Very classy thief! Classy! Thank you. Thief? He misbehaved with you, I punished him. That's no theft. That is theft. Feeling guilty? Then apologise to him. But if you want to thank me for punishing him, then there's a better bar in Colva. Now I get it. I've known guys to pay the bill and flirt, but, dude, without paying! Excellent. But I am not in Goa to party or see cheap tricks from hunks like you. Try it on someone else. -Excuse me? -Yes? Sorry, but there's been some confusion, can you pay the guy whose card was used, I think they're over there... Is he is a ghost that he just vanished? If she shows so much attitude, he will vanish. It was a perfect plan Ishika, you ruined it. He was convinced that you are a damsel in distress. Damsel in distress! No one gives a second glance to damsels these days. I can't play a damsel. We've hired you! You have to play according to our rules. Miss director, I am the one who has to deal with him face to face. You can't press a remote and have fun. I am not an actress, I have to play it my way. What if he were to catch me acting, then? The partnership idea has to be sold to him, I'll sell it. I've never let you go empty handed from the mall, have I? Okay, but now we have to think of a new move. Don't worry the next move will be made by him. With hearty compliments from Mr. Vikram Thapar. -Vikram who? -Mr. Thapar, Goa's beach king. Out of all the water sporting between Varca to Anjuna at least a dozen are owned by him. Including the one at our hotel. You met him last night at the bar. That's Vikram Thapar? Yes, ma'am. -Interesting name. -Interesting man. If you want to thank him, then you can find him at the beach. -Have a nice day, ma'am. -Thank you. This is finished. How will we run the business if he does this? Tell him. Grease. Mr. Beach King, credit card trick didn't work so you sent flowers? They always work. Here you are. So I was right. Last night's drama was to attract me. You are so attractive what could I do? Thank you. For the flowers. Is it from your own money or stolen cash? Did they smell nice? So how does it matter then? I want to go for a ride. -Come, I will take you -I will drive. If you are not here to party then what're you doing here? To prove that I can also set up a business. -Prove to whom? -To my father. I told him I wanted to set up a chain of restaurants in India, he thought it was stupid. Do anything in the U.S. but not in India. After numerous fights he has conceded that I first set up the project like land, licences, clearances, staff everything, and then he'll invest five million. -Five million dollars is... -Twenty five crores Right. But do you know how much he's given me for my trip? Five lakhs including transport, hotel food. But I'll prove it. I won't leave here till my restaurant is set up, even if it means sleeping on the beaches. I can help you set up your restaurant. Really? But why? Lone girl, millionaire dad, trap her, take her money. Is this the plan? Right! This was my plan. But you're so clever, you don't need any help. Goa is waiting for you. All the honest officers, land owners, cops, collector, ministers. They will help you honestly. You have a good evening. Hey, Mr. Beach King! Want to have a beer? I don't want any favors. Do you want an equal partnership of sharing, but profit sharing will be 60-40. You said equal partnership? My idea, so 60 mine. Agreed? Okay agreed. You will also have to invest in the partnership. Oh. Obviously. Why do you think I am letting you be my partner? I'm not going to runV away with your money, all the expenses will be transparent and for the yacht party. Yacht party? See? Every time I go to meet somebody, they don't take me seriously. If we organise a yacht party, good food, music, wine, invite all the important people in Goa, put photos in the press. Just see, the phone won't stop ringing. Entire Goa will help our restaurant. That's how we promote in the states. Had I the money, I would've had the party, and started the restaurant by now. How much will we need for the party? A crore perhaps. As soon as dad sanctions his 25 crores, your money will be returned. So partner or no partner? Partner. How much for this? One can get shoes for 500 rupees here. And that one? Need to check other properties, let's go. Which brand? Mango, Diesel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gucci. What time is it? Tripping on these Jalapenos. We have to leave now, come on, come on, come on... -I'm not done eating... -We have to leave, he is not going to Wait for us all day. What's the rush? We're late for the meeting. -What happened? -You have got to be kidding me, man... What're you doing? Watch out, watch out. What the hell? No price tag? We'll put it when we get there. Yeah, Gaurav? On our way. -Hey, Gaurav. What's up? -You are looking nice. Come, come, come. -Okay, that's Saira. -Hello. This is Dimple. -Hi. -Hello. Ladies on a mission huh? Come. Like a fool I rushed here, didn't even pack properly. All the money is going to the hotel bill. I think I should shift from Pallazzo to a cheaper one star hotel. From the money I save, I can buy a dress at least. You won't be able to handle a one star. So what to do? I don't have a dress for the party. Let's go shopping! How sweet. This is what they are wearing in New York now, like now. -It's lovely. -Prada! Beautiful. Ninety thousand only. Only! One dress is not good enough, I mean at least... I need at least eight, matching foot wear, jewellery, accessories. Take everything. It's an investment for our future. I mean business future. And it's backless. It's good. Now, that's nice. It's nice. Nice couple. But the boy is short. Why don't you get heels? I can't believe we have shopped so much. Sixteen lakhs fifty thousand. Yes! Yes! Yes! Mind blowing. Thank you. Oh, my God. Okay, enough hugging, kissing. Let's get back to work. Phase two! Can you talk, Ishika? Listen yachts are parked at the Madovi Jetty. One of them is my friend Fardeen's Yacht. He has explained everything to the captain. He is all set. He will ask you for the entire payment in advance. Then you take over. The yacht is Brown in colour and called... Freedom. Freedom it is! So? Including food and beverages, and 6:00 p.m. to midnight will be 20 lakhs in total. Too much no? That's 40,000 dollars. In the US this party will cost at least a 100,000 dollars. Actually, it's a good deal. Aye, aye, captain sail the boat. Full advance payment in cash, then booking, then sailing. Done. How much is this? Invitation card? Invitation card. Oh. Gorgeous. Here you go. Ninety rupees. Is this the cheapest? Only mango juice will be cheaper than this. Forty bottles, please. How much? Twenty and 50 I'll take all. A 200 bucks bottle is now worth 90,000. Thank you. So far we've earned 45 lakhs. After Ishika's fee and all expenses, we are left with 35. Ishika Patel, you are a genius. There are at least eight investors. In fact, we might not need your dad's money anymore. No. I don't need anymore partners. I am happy with one, whom I can trust completely. No really, for any business trust is crucial. Right. Trust is crucial. Oh, my God! Vikram. Once more, once more. We never had any in our childhood so I go crazy when I see them now. Papa got us one of each firework and, they would be finished in seconds. I would be angry with the fireworks when they finished so soon, wondering, why have they finished? But why rationing on the fireworks? Your father could've bought an entire factory right? Had my father not rationed in the beginning of his business, then how would he have become the Motel King? Let's go. Let's go party. Haven't we just been to a party? That wasn't a party, it was business. Isn't it late? Is someone waiting for you? Alright, Vikram Thapar, let's party. Let's party. She isn't answering. Booking was till 12. Party must have finished long time ago. Real romance has happened between the calf and the butcher. Real romance. Raina, if what she is saying is true, then? Then, my dear, we are screwed. All night party! While we've been rotting in that hell-hole, she is living it up in the five-star. Partying with Sunny all night. I had to go with him to build his confidence. What other debaucheries did you do to build his confidence? -Raina, please tell her to shut up. -I am not going to shut up. You are in Goa for us. We've hired you. We are footing the bills. Not for you to hang out with my ex-boyfriend like shameless bitch. That's enough, Dimple. You are always taking her side. Dimple, just shut up. Do you have any idea how worried we've been all night? Any idea? I am really sorry. Champagne, beer, yacht, brain got a bit side tracked. I promise it won't happen again. I am on your side. Now the focus is to defeat the Bloody Scoundrel. Down with the Bloody Scoundrel. We haven't even recovered half the amount yet. We've a long way to go. Don't ditch, Ishika. I won't. Dimple, come on. Hi, you haven't slept? I want to show you something mind blowing. Okay, let's go. I know, even my mind is completely blown. Wow! This land is perfect for the restaurant. Very nice. Actually it's perfect. Let's make it here. Let's talk to the owner. Wait, wait, wait partner. Before we go ahead I want to share a few secrets, after knowing them you might want to break the partnership. What secret can that be? I'm not breaking the partnership. You will also have to tell me your secrets. I don't have any secrets. -You can tell me yours. -I am a conman. I am a thief. For the last 15 years, I've conned 30 ladies. You are the 31st. Friendship, partnership... Investment in your project has all been for this. My plan was to run away after fleecing you, but I fell in love with you Ishika. I am not lying. I have lied a lot. I've spent my entire life alone, even if I wanted to be friends with someone, I would scold myself and restrain, but since I met my heart won't listen to me. Do you? Love me? Will you marry me, Ishika? He proposed to you? Liar. Look at her face. He never proposed to me, why would he propose to her? It's not a proposal, it's a con silly. The biggest con of his life. After marrying her he will have her, her father's, the land's, the restaurant's money in his pocket. With an investment of 40 lakhs, he plans to hit the billion dollar jackpot. That's why I was wondering why is he buying her all these dresses and shoes for? He will marry for money. Marry him. No way. Are you crazy? This is the best way to get the rest of our money. How? Her father won't marry her off to a thief like Vikram Thapar without any security right? And for that security Ishika's father will ask him to buy that land in her name. Before the wedding. So will she get married to Sunny? No, the plot will be bought before the wedding. We'll sell it immediately after its registration. Take our money, and get on the first flight home. Not bad, Saira. Can you clear one matter first, will she or wont she be married to Sunny? No. Ishika will only accept his proposal. Make him speak to her father. Right, we have to find a papa for her. Let me figure this out. I'll make tea. I'll leave. No, let Raina finish her call. Did he give you flowers? What? When he proposed. Ring? No. Plain? Kiss? You guys must have definitely kissed. I am conning him, and he is conning me. Where did the kiss come from? Kiss is a bitch. It creeps up anywhere. Okay, papa sorted. Ishika tell him I do, I do, I do. Before that, let's find out the value of the land. It's a fair deal, ma'am. Don't worry. Owner is settled in Dubai, I have the Power of Attorney. I'll do the formalities. Final price 90 Lakhs. No bargaining. Sorry. Ninety Lakhs. -My gosh! -Yes, yes. Really? Mind-blowing! Papa call time! Papa. Hello Mr. Patel. Vikram Thapar? Yes sir, Vikram Thapar. Let's come straight to the point. What's the turnover of your water sports business? Not even 50 Lakhs annually. Ishika's shoes almost cost that much! Sir, honestly I don't have your kind of money. But Ishika's happiness is most important to me. I promise to always keep her happy. My dear, a promise has no value. My dear a promise has no value. Bills cannot be paid by promises. Moreover, how do I know you are not marrying my daughter for her money? Tell me. Sir, I love Ishika, not her money. I can't just believe what you say. Trust needs proof. If you want to marry Ishika, then buy a land of her choice registered in her name for her restaurant. I'll make the rest of the investment in the restaurant, but if you buy the land then I'll be rest assured that she has some security. That's my condition. What happened? Can't give the security? I'll give sir. Of course I will. For Ishika, I'll do anything. The butcher becomes the calf. I am telling you, the scoundrel is in love. He can't love anyone. He is laying his trap slowly and steadily. He is getting caught up in it. I am trapped. I've made a promise but I don't have 90 lakhs. I have only 45 left after the yacht party. So now? Had I not met you, I could have conned someone for it easily. But now I can't do it. I love you... But how will I give your father security? I don't know! We will have to give the rest of the 45 Lakhs. Crazy? We've got it with so much difficulty. With our 45 and his 45, he will buy the plot. Hopefully when we sell it we will get more than 90, and we'll recover all our money. Okay Ishika, tell him you raised 45 by selling your jewellery. Okay? But Raina, what if he has genuinely fallen in love with me, then? What's going on here? Love what else? I told you she's a traitor. He is leading you on. He can't love anyone. He loves me... perhaps. Ishika waved the magic wand and the scoundrel became a caring, honest lover. Believe me, he has changed. If you look into his eyes, you will see an honest man. Enough, Ishika. Even I've seen his eyes, when he spoke to my father-in-law about his poor mother and sister and stole our 10 Lakhs. If you don't want to carry on, it's okay. But don't mock us. We're stupid and you're clever. When he vanishes after breaking your heart, that's when you will realise her pain and know that we are your well-wishers, not that rogue. Raina... The money for Vikram. Are we crazy to hand over so much money to a thief's girlfriend? You will run away with it. Aren't you in love with him? I am. I am in love with him. But I'm an honest sales girl, not a thief. Less salary, tough life, but I feel proud when my bosses praise me for my honesty. I wouldn't sell that feeling even for a hundred crore. I won't cheat you. Trust me. I'll return all your money. Promise me, no more lies. I love you. I love you. Owner? Mr. Abhay Salaskar. He is settled in Dubai. Power of Attorney is with me D'Silva. Buyer? Ishika Patel. Sign please. Ma'am, sign here please. Hundred percent genuine! Ishika, sorry, and thank you. It's okay. Sorry. Thank you. I can't wait to see his face when he sees us and realises that he has been duped. But where is the scoundrel? -This is fine. -Hello. Hello, excuse me, what are you doing here? Flood control. Where's the flood? It's not here now, but it will come after the monsoons. Who gave you permission? We are the new owners of this land. Take our permission. You? Isn't the owner Abhay Salaskar? Was. He is in Dubai now. We bought it. For 90 lakhs. -90 Lakhs! -Cheap deal, isn't it? What would be its market value now? Three lakhs. With great difficulty. This is a swamp. It's under water for five months. What value? Check the deed, may be there is an extra zero by mistake. Even nine Lakhs is too much. David, Abhay Salaskar has cheated them. Ninety Lakhs. What's your cut? What? How much will that scoundrel give you out of the 90? Is it a 50-50 or a 60-40 partnership? Was it his idea because an idea is worth more, or was it yours? -Shut up, Raina. -You double crossing bitch. -Shut up, Raina. -Liar, thief, bloody scoundrel. Raina, shut up! -Ishika. -Shut up all of you. I did it for you and you are accusing me? Calling me a thief? To hell with you. Raina! Had Ishika cheated us, then why would she come here? Don't abuse her for your defeat. The scoundrel has cheated her as well. First, he bought the land himself, for three lakhs as Abhay Salaskar from Dubai. Then he gave the Power of Attorney to D'Silva. Ishika met D'Silva who quoted 90 lakhs. Out of which we gave 45 Lakhs. After signing the deed D'Silva gave the entire money to Bloody Scoundrel. Aren't I too good? I had boarded the plane after the security check, but could not take off. For the first time, it was no fun. I conned girls because I thought it was a game, which I would win. I never stopped to think, that along with cash, what else the girls lost. Now that I know, the game is no fun. I thought I was superstar Shahrukh Khan, but this time, even though I won, I have lost. Your money. It is one crore. You have straightened this Bloody Scoundrel out. I can't do con jobs anymore, and I know nothing else. Thanks to you all, I will have to learn honest work. I am not good at saying sorry, so... Hats off, boss! Hats off. If you ever meet Ishika, tell her my proposal was real. I really fell in love with her. But she turned out to be a real player, hats off to her as well. Abhay Salaskar! How does he come up with these names? Sunny and I were dating seriously. And I wondered why isn't he going first base? First what? Kissing! So I thought, I'd take him there. I came on to him in the night club, but he didn't kiss me. He could have taken advantage, I was ready. But he didn't exploit me. But he doesn't know how much Ishika loves him, right? No, only we know. No, no, don't do that. Give this pamphlet to your mother. HomeTown is offering 25 percent discount on all sections.

By the way, we have a 25 percent discount in all the sections. Please do check it out. Won't you ask me why I came back? Not really, I am 22 years old, I have a lot to achieve, a lot to earn. I went off track once and lost out. But now I won't make a mistake, I want to mint money. Not a good plan! I've been there, done that. It's no fun making money on your own. Let's be partners, same deal 60 yours, 40 mine. No lies, no cheating. Your brains, my courage, world's best partnership. You've conned 31 girls right? I don't want to be 32nd. I will constantly be seeking the truth in your lies. I was telling the truth then, I am telling the truth now. You were lying then, you are lying now. You might feign anger but your eyes are saying, clearly, that you are happy to see me here. That's why we are made for each other, we won't be able to lie to each other, because we will be caught. A 100 percent true partnership of two liars. If you are so in love with my lies, then why did you leave me and go? It was my last con, how could I have lost? Ishika Desai, I love you. Marry me. Straight to marriage, don't you want to test me as a girlfriend or something? I am the number one conman, I have checked everything before attacking. Wait wait, first tell me your real name. Bahl, Ricky Bahl. Ricky! What kind of name is that? I don't want to marry a Ricky. Dimple, don't worry. We'll look for a much better groom for you than Ricky. I don't want him anymore, I just want to go home to mummy and papa.
