How easy our lives would be if it's like those in the magazine. Yes. I was thinking of quitting this job and settling down in my village. Will you take me with you? Of course. You'll be there always. I've asked Paul for money. It'd be helpful if we could get that savings scheme. We can buy land in my village with that. Aren't you bathing? Oh, I'll bathe tomorrow. I'm already late. So it's not because you're lazy? Hey, don't you have to go for a checkup tomorrow? Yes. And I need to buy a cradle also. You don't remember all these things. I haven't forgotten. Aren't you due in two weeks? So you haven't forgotten, right? If I work overtime for two days, I'll get extra money. We need that money now. We have to meet the medical expenses. And we need to buy that land also. That's why I'm working overtime. -Shall I go? -Yes Oh, I forgot to turn the TV off. It has become common nowadays. The Prime Minister of India is going to address the nation now. We have decided that the 500 and 1,000 currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight... The increase in black money and fake notes is one of the reasons for the increase in corruption and terrorism. This is the reason why the central government has taken this crucial step. Aren't you going to work? Do you have cash with you? How will I have? Prime Minister has banned currencies of 1,000 and 500. How can he ban our currency? Shall find out when I get my salary tomorrow. This is why the poor are always poor. Dude, get him. Leave me. -Here. -I quit smoking. Oh, this is usual. Everyone says so. No. I've seriously quit. Great! Give me that lighter. No, I can't give this. She gave me this as a gift asking me not to smoke again. Who would someone give a lighter and then ask you to quit smoking? Things like this happen when you get someone to share your life. You won't understand. Of course! Gifting a pair of fish to your wife, and saying that it's us! This lighter is better than that. What plans for tonight? I'm working overtime tonight. You're working overtime the entire month, right? Take care of your health. I need to look after the baby. And there are other expenses also. Baby hasn't come out yet, right? You can start earning after that. Come, let's go. While giving us salary, will they fool us by giving old currencies? We have time till the 31st of this month. So don't worry. Why should we worry? Only those who have got black money need to worry. Good that we don't have a huge amount of money. Even if we do, we need not worry. There're ways to exchange it. Is it? How come? -Got anything with you? -No. Come. It's time. I knew that you've come this way to pray. How can we forget God in our life? So, will you be coming to the temple tomorrow? You've got only two days for checkup, right? Today is the last day. From now on, it's going to be hospital and home. Can I leave Sachu at your place today? I have to attend a wedding. Sure. I'll have company then. -Hi -Hey, come in. Can you give me this? No, I won't. What if I give you this firefly? Come. Sir, why aren't you answering my calls? Like you said, I've beaten him to a pulp. Where should I hide? You assured me that you'd take care of everything. I don't have a single penny with me. Hello. Hello. Shit! Next shift will begin now. That's why I called you. Sachu is here. They must be hanging around leaving him there. It's nice to have him around. Should I ask Paul to accompany you to the hospital tomorrow? Why do you have to bother others? I'll go alone. Hello. I was not scolding you. -Hey, not that. I was just thinking... -Time's up. What were you thinking? Nothing. Let me report for duty. I won't call you tomorrow. Our Director is visiting us. I'll be busy. Okay. Bye. Shit! You've lost this time, too! I'm not playing this anymore. Deal the cards for the next game. If you lose, it doesn't mean you can throw away the cards. There he is. Have you brought the cops along? I'm trapped in this. You went all by yourself. You should pay for it. Move to some other place for a while. Where will I go? Go wherever you want, but don't come here. I can't take their thrashings anymore. Please find a solution. Hey. I know one journalist. She's always interested in this sort of story. What will I tell her? Go and meet her. I'll call and give her the details. Hey, are you coming? You want to play cards? I'm going. Fine. Go Simi, what do you know about pregnancy? I don't know anything much. I've just read a little bit about it. It's the first time for everyone. Even they don't know much about it. Just say whatever you know. It's just like in the movies, you scream loudly, and the baby comes out. You're pretending to be dumb in order to flatter others, right? Kind of. Yes. You may leave. See, nature has planned everything. So you don't have to overthink. Our bodies will respond accordingly. All you have to do is push. If it was just about pushing, we could have stayed at home and done that. In the past, there were no hospitals. Deliveries used to happen at home. Look how happy he is. Like he has pulled a prank on me. Sister, are you always like this? -Okay. -Shall we go? -Is it finished? -Yes. -Hello. -What is it? I'm a little busy. No, wait. I went to the hospital today. I bought the cradle, too. I'm busy here. Don't call me unnecessarily. Okay, I was just going to sleep... Hey! Who are you? Why are you here at this time of night? I missed my bus, that's why. They are always like this. They will cancel the trip if there aren't enough people. Please, can you give me the phone? I need to call a friend. Here. Hello. Hello, Anwar here. Why are you calling me? I went to Gracy's house many times. I didn't find anyone there. Cops are searching for you everywhere. Do whatever you want. Don't call me. Just end the call. Hey. Is your friend coming to pick you up? He'll come. You can leave. -Hello. -Hello. This phone's owner has met with an accident. I can't hear you. At Estate Road... -His condition is very critical. -Hello! What happened to Ajith? Shall we put her here? It's not safe here. Take her inside. There was a phone in the car. Who asked you to take it? Give me your phone. This phone alone will do. Outgoing calls are barred on this. She is pregnant. What if something happens to her? So what? She isn't your relative, right? Her body structure is appealing, even though she is pregnant. Everything goes ahead according to our plan. There's no change. -What's the time? -It's 4:20 a.m. Let me go and deal with her car before it becomes late. Aren't you eating? Hello. Hello. Open the door. Hello. Open the door. Rajesh! Rajesh. Wake up. She's yelling over there. Where is he? He'll be there somewhere. Come. Don't make a scene. I'll talk to her. Okay, go. Lilli, we want to know something. You let go of me. Let go of me. Don't shout. No one's going to hear. Rajesh! Rajesh. Come here. Who are you? What do you want? We want to know something. When you tell us that, we'll let you go. I don't know anything. Please let me go. Lilli... We don't want to hurt you. We want to know only one thing. We won't hurt you. I don't know anything. I want to go home. I want to see Ajith. What do you want? Where is she? I don't know. You better tell us. I said I don't know. Can't you answer? Rajesh! Philip... Take him out. Didn't I tell you? I'm the one who informed you about the accident. His body must be lying somewhere on the road. Didn't I tell you not to harm her? If we find that girl, we'll get enough money to live the rest of our lives. Money alone won't do for me. She's pregnant. So what? Just turn her around. Please control yourself until she talks. After that, do whatever you want. Don't even give her water. When she starves, she'll speak automatically. Get me a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of water. One cigarette and a lime soda. Let's wait till tomorrow. I'll call you back. You didn't buy anything? There was only a small shop. They're not accepting the old currency. Don't you have anything else? I have only this, and some coins. Rajesh has money with him, I guess. I'll get it from him. Why did you kill it? Just for fun. Didn't I tell you yesterday to leave it alone. But I didn't do so. Then why don't you kill the dog, too? I will if I want to. She won't escape from here. No one's going to hear her. No one's going to come for her. She has no other option but to tell the truth. Or else... She will die here. She hasn't stopped crying. She's not going to die. Do you want to die? It's better to tell the truth and leave. I don't know. Please let me go. Think about my baby, at least. I haven't eaten anything. Why should we be bothered about your baby? Tell us the truth and you can leave. There's no use screaming out here. No need for any lights in this room. Shut off the lights. You survive this night first. We'll see. Is Gracy here? Alex told me to come. Come in. Is this the time to visit someone? Aren't you the one who opened the door? Please sit. Alex has told me everything. Anwar, tell me your side of things. I'm the one who stabbed him. Well, he's not the first. But this time, the police are after me. You have assaulted a retired judge. You think the police and the media are going to leave you alone? That's because-- Just a minute. This is not a place for criminals. You don't have to do this job. This is going to be sensational news tomorrow. I can't allow this here. Please, Manu. Try to understand. Do whatever you want. Manu. Dude, come back. Just ten minutes. I'll make her talk. Stop it and come. Just come. My name is Lilli. I've been kidnapped by three people. I'm pregnant. They have killed my husband. They're going to kill me next. I don't know where I am. If at all you find this mobile phone, please come and save me. Here, this is your toilet. I guess you don't need it anymore. Rajesh! How long are you going to be like this? It's your baby who's going to die if you don't talk. Do you want it to be still born? Give me a chance. I'll make her tell the truth. Let's wait till tomorrow. If not, you do whatever you want. She's pregnant. What if something happens, if she's tortured? What did you think? That she'd go with her baby? Are you scared? Just think about what we're getting. Your fear will go. You can't do anything without taking risk. There's no turning back. Let's find that girl at the earliest and get away from here with the money. So, what about her? As if you don't know. You have tea? Yes, sit. Sir, tea? Look at him. Is he the same guy? Let's check. I said stop there. Stop there. Where are you going in such a hurry? Lilli. Lilli! Lilli! So, what did you decide? This is your last chance. After this there will be no more questions. Philip, have you seen anyone giving birth? No. I also haven't seen. I guess we can see it today. Are you going to give birth so that we can kill your baby? I don't have a problem. We'll kill it right in front you. Mar Gregory's... Louder! Mar Gregory's Orphanage, Convent Road. How far is it from here? Around one-and-a-half hours. Let me go there and look. Give her food. Once I reach there, I'll call you if I find her. You can let her go after that. Whatever I told is true only. Please let me go. If it becomes late, my baby... All this time you didn't say anything when we asked politely. So let me go and see if you've told the truth. We'll let you go after that. Whatever I said is true. Please let me go. At least think of my baby. Shyam, just check if there's a display for this phone. Yes. It will take some time. It's okay. I'll wait. Do you have a new sim card? Do you have an ID card? We can't activate the sim without it. Then it's okay. I'll come later. Okay. -Please do it quickly. -Okay. Will you stop making these sounds? I'm already tensed. I hope he finds the girl. Let's take the money and leave this place at the earliest. Why do you have to be tense? Let's wait till she gives birth. We can leave after that. Go and get something to eat. I don't think we'll get anything here. Get it from somewhere, otherwise she'll die. His glucose! Lilli, don't cry. Drink this water. -Isn't it 750? -Yes. All right. My name is Lilli. I've been kidnapped by three people. Auto. Go to Company Junction. Oh, God! Brother, time's up. Eat this. Why do you suffer like this? You just have to scream. They'd leave without saying anything. Boss said not to take any more customers today. We've got new neighbors. Nuns. Don't you know everything? We have arranged it. You won't get anything here. Mumbai is much easier. I've paid your boss enough. Once he finds a replacement, we can leave. But... First, it's going to be me. Don't forget that. Hey, are you leaving? I'll accompany you till the junction. Your boss's shelf is stacked with money. He must have earned it through her. Shall we rob him? What about Lilli? I've paid the amount he asked. What else? I'm going to make money with her. You're not going to do anything. You're not taking her anywhere. She's mine, the money also. Don't come here ever again. Listen. This is the banyan tree. From here, we have to walk further. This is the lower primary school. This is where I studied. If we walk further from here, we'll reach the temple. This big house was ours, but my uncle cheated us and made it his. Forget about that. This is my house. Only I live in that house now. Lilli, shall I take you there? There's no need to explain so much to invite a prostitute home. Our lives are not just based here. Buy yourself a new chain. You're not going anywhere. Sister! Sister! Sister! Who's it? I'm Sandhya. I came here to work. What work? Cleaning. Sir said you will teach me everything. Which sir? Did he say anything else? He offered to teach my brother. Then... He gave an old car to my uncle. Sister, do you have this room's key? I think sir locked this room by mistake. -Come here! -Sir! Child! Child. Let go of me. Child, what happened? Child! Sir, please let me go. Who locked this door? Open the door. Child! Sister! Keep quiet. Shut up, otherwise I'll kill you. Child! Sister! Child! Please save me. Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Sister! Child! Let me go. Just let me go. Open the door. Sister! Sister! Come here. Don't hurt to her. Move back. She's just a child. Let me go. Let her go. Move back. Sir, let me go. Child! -Sister. -Don't worry. Don't worry. Sit here. -Do what I say. -Okay. I'll return in a moment. Let's go. Somewhere far from here. Brother, a girl has been imprisoned here. Here? Who told you? Watch this. My name is Lilli. I've been kidnapped by three people. I'm pregnant. This might not be here. No idea, but let's have a look. Do you know which building it is? I don't remember exactly. It's somewhere here. These are deserted quarters of an old company. There are 10 to 15 buildings here. Let's check it out. Okay. Philip! Philip! Son of a bitch! Open the door. Open! Do what I say. Open the door. Open. Open it! Oh, God! Where's my baby? Tell me. Threw it to the dogs. Rajesh. She tricked us. There's no one here. Rajesh? Only you're left now. Come. I'm coming, you-- Ajith! What are you doing? Come! You don't know me. You don't know anyone. You've no idea what's happening around you. I'll make you speak. The money which you've got is the blood of your clients and pimps. Understood? How many times have I asked you for that money? And on so many different occasions. Didn't I? But you... I just wanted to scare you and get the truth out of you. But you... You're the same old liar. Okay. It's all right. Nothing happened. We can fix all this. Just tell me where that girl is. I'll leave if I get that money. You can go and live happily after that. Is that okay? Tell me. Tell me. So, you won't speak? You won't speak? I'll make you speak. If you'd told the truth earlier, this wouldn't have happened. What a time for demonetization! You've killed them all, haven't you? Good! You made my job easier. There is a saying that prostitutes shouldn't be so stubborn. Tell me the truth. Where's that girl? Don't you want to know about our baby? Our baby! How can I be sure that it's my baby? Are you sure? Tell the truth before I kill you. Where is she? My baby. Your baby! Just die! What? -I'll tell you. -Tell me. -I'll tell you. -Tell me. It was a boy. There's been a new lead in the Factory Colony murder case. DNA reports and other evidence confirm Lilli's involvement. Six months after the crime, there has still been no arrest. The investigation will be handed over--
