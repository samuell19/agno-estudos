Inspired by the true story of Lai Chi-wai, the Hong Kong Bun Scrambling Champion When life is difficult When life is twisted When life threatens you with despair Don't cry, don't be discouraged, don't give up I hope I will forever stay with you When life is crazy When life is twisted When life threatens you with despair Don't cry, don't be discouraged, don't give up I hope I will forever stay with you When life is crazy When life is twisted When life is... Please let us go through. Excuse me, please let us go through. Excuse me, may I ask... Please line up. Excuse me, may I ask... Excuse me, miss, please line up. - No, my husband is... - I know, can you line up first? Line up! Ma'am, please line up. We all have to line up. No. My husband had an accident and was sent here. I just want to know where he is. You should have said so earlier. What kind of absentminded wife are you? You look so chill yourself. Did it take you a while to find? Were you together? No. I was asking about just now. I just got a call from the hospital. They said Ki Tai-wai had an accident and he's undergoing surgery now. Mr. Ki just had surgery. The doctor wants to explain his situation to you. Please come with me. The patient's wife. - Mrs. Ki? - Yes. Your husband's situation is... It's Dr. Wong. A call? Hello? Dr. Wong? Yes. I'll follow up with that operation later. No problem, thank you. Mr. Ki's thoracic vertebrae T11 and T12 are fractured... Doctor. Hello? Yes. What is fractured? I am at ICU. Fine, I'll follow up with the patient later. The patient has a compound fracture. His nerves are severely compressed inside his vertebrae. Dr. Mak, the operation can't wait. I'll go with you now. Doctor, so what's happening to my husband? Sorry. He probably won't be able to walk again. Nurse! - Ki Tai-wai. - Hey! Does the patient know what it is? I'm about to explain. That means you haven't yet. Go and ask if he knows what it is. - Ki Tai-wai... - Are you really going to ask? There are so many patients. If you ask them all, how can you finish work? Just tell him. Ki Tai-wai, this button is for morphine injection. Hold it like this. - Thank you. - Does he know what morphine is for? It relieves pain. What are its side effects? It's addictive. Only use a dose every time. So? Morphine is addictive. Only use a dose every time. And it relieves pain. Nurse, give me a dose first. Ask if he understands first. You just said it. But she hasn't. Ki Tai-wai, do you understand? Didn't he just say so? Thank you, Nursing Officer. How do I use it? See, if you don't explain carefully, it can cause problems. That's why detailed explanation is the responsibility of medical workers like us. Look after him. Don't use it all. Okay. Hey! I beat you! Congratulations then. Do you want a late-night supper with me? I never have late-night supper. Are you welching on our deal? What do you want then? Let's do one round. Keep it in the book. I'll let you know. Did you press it? How many times have you pressed it? Use one dose only! Are you all right? What? - How are you? - Stay away! Don't come any closer! My wife is here! Go! Just go! - What did you see? - Honey. Honey, I just saw a cow. - A cow? Where? - It was... Don't be silly. Honey, it hurts. - Should I call the doctor? - No, honey. No, honey... I'll get you some water. Let me pour you a glass of water. Honey, I just saw... Loser. What are you looking at? What do you know about fashion? You're no different than me, loser. I heard you can't walk anymore. I can definitely walk again. I wish you could walk again too. Is that funny? I'm the Bun Scrambling Champion. We are both Bun Scrambling Champions. Repeat after me. We are both Bun Scrambling Champions. It's morphine. Just press it, don't push yourself. Do you think you're still young? I will hang on. I must. If it hurts, just press it. You are all elite athletes representing Hong Kong. The World Cup is the most important event organized by IFSC. Each year, a series of competitions will be held in different locations. Athletes will compete in sub-contests to earn scores based on their rankings. Final ranks are determined by the end of the year. Listen up, both of you. What I'm about to say is relevant to you two. The last Speed Climbing World Record was 6.26 seconds. To get in, you need to finish in seven seconds. If we want to get ahead of everyone, we must keep our time within seven seconds. Does he have a chance? - Yes. - Yes. - What's the time? - Does he have a chance to die? It's 6.82 seconds. - Yes! - Who can tell me... You lost last time and you just did again. - I know how to punish you. - The safety belt is in the right place. - What is it? - And the carabiner isn't locked properly. - Here. - All these three are for the same aim. We won't be friends anymore. Are you sure? Everyone, give this smart kid a round of applause. Hey, this is a ward, not a gym. Get someone here! I need to transfer ward. Stop yelling. There's no freedom of religion here. If I hear you making noise again, I'll send you to the morgue. Why does your husband have to apply for Disability Allowance? He had a car accident. He can't walk anymore. Which one of his limbs did he lose? None. Then we can't process it right away. But he really lost the ability to move. Then we need his medical report to prove that he can never walk again. If he can walk again in the future, it would be difficult for us. Does that mean he has to lose an entire leg before I can apply? No, he needs to lose two arms or legs or one arm and one leg. But the nurse at the hospital told me to apply. That's right. You've turned in the application. Then what should I do next? Nothing. Wait for his medical report to prove he has completely lost his ability to work. Any other questions? No... Seriously. To apply for allowances, everything must be done by the book. We can't make exceptions. Thank you. No. 0013, please go to the reception. Okay, we have everything we need. I'll issue a check in ten minutes. But I just gave you my ID card. We're Loan Express. Give us the other information later. Call me if you need anything. We'll be here to help. All is done. Customers are our priority. We stand by you. - Thank you. - I've heard of it before. - Awesome. - You heard of it? That's awesome, right? If you need money, you should've asked me first. I'm your mom. Why would I mind? You wouldn't with me, but you would with him. I always teach you to make hay when the sun shines. - Always be frugal. - Always be frugal. What does that mean? Earnings and savings, you know? I do, I've been making money and saving up too. You're my daughter. Of course I know you do. But he... Just stop it. The crib was fine here. Why do you have to move it there? His wheelchair won't be able to pass through. With his wheels rolling around, my floor will be ruined. You have to take care of two. Worse for me, I have to take care of you three. Thank you, Mom! Now, excuse me. You don't have to visit me separately. Oliver is worried that I'm bored. I'm all right. - Let me help. - I can prop myself up. If you can, you wouldn't have to be here. They wouldn't have to come to visit you. I can do it. Yes, right. Hey! Do you think I can't feel your stare? I didn't know you made friends with other patients. You aren't bored then. I got this for you from Yosemite. Didn't you compete in Australia? I was about to go, but I ended up going to Yosemite instead. Did you go by yourself? Do you want to be carried there? That works too. Excuse me, please leave for a moment. The patient needs to change his diaper. Yes, I have to use a diaper. Only for now. I have to go. Why don't you go get a drink first? Come chat with me later. That's all right. I'll come to see you next time. Shouldn't we lay him on his side to change diapers? It doesn't sound right. Yes, that's why I asked you. I think we should lay him flat. How are you? Honey. Guess what I bought you? What is it? Which color do you like? I like this one. That was my guess too. Mr. Chu, I also got one for you. Which color do you like? Me? You don't have to get me one. Green it is. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, which one do you like better? I mean the straws. I'll go wash your cup. If I could choose, I'd choose this one. I mean the straws. Come on. This clubhouse wants to have a fusion of facilities, so I made this deep-water solo wall. They are open tomorrow. You're the first one here. With this wall, we can practice all day, defeat all the other climbers, go to Prague, and be the world champions. There can only be one champion. You should bet. You have classes to teach and this is a big venue. Can you handle it by yourself? Probably not, that's why I have you. That's funny. It's just your idea. I wish my ideas would come true. That would be nice. What does that mean? I'll take that as a yes. Hey! All right. We'll see. Hey! Let's go! You're crippled, not blind. This is my nostrils. Focus. Feel your muscles. If it was back in the days, I wouldn't need to be fed by you. I have people waiting in line to feed me. How did you get injured like this? After drinking with my friends in Sai Kung, I drove my Lamborghini back to Repulse Bay. Who knows, some guy provoked me into a race. Of course I couldn't let him walk away. Just outside Eastern Harbor Crossing, both of our cars flipped over. Don't look at me like a loser. I didn't lose. I'm lying here, but that guy is dead. No one comes to visit you. You don't have a family? You fool! I sure do. My dad has four wives, 12 daughters, and 3 sons. With me, we are one big family, a big tribe that gets to share a piece of meat. Sharing meat? What does that mean? You peasants have no common sense. We are native Hong Kong people who inherit lands. I'm done. What? That fast? Keep training. Are you crazy? I thought you were bored, so I played along. You're an athlete, but I'm an emperor. Let me tell you. The fortune-teller said I have the fate of an emperor. After the age of 35, I'll be fed in bed. See? It all came true. Then did the fortune-teller say when you'll get married? You fool. I look like Transformer now. Girls run away when they see me. By the way, are Hulk and your wife good friends? Give it back. I won't mention it again. I'm done. But I don't think Hulk loves you. It's right you didn't choose her. Gosh. - What's wrong? - Call of nature. - Call of what? - Gosh. What did you do? Of course I pooped. Call the nurse. Can you feel it? Feel it? Yes. I can feel it. - Why can I? - Okay. - Don't move. - Nurse! I can feel it! I pooped myself! I can feel that I pooped myself! I can feel it! I pooped myself! Hey! Come swim with me. You might get heatstroke. If you're not working, I'll have to do your part too. Hey, buddy. You're here to manage the place, not here to play. Who's playing? I'm picking up holds. Please. Find a brighter guy. She's mine. That's none of your business. I'm not yours. That's your wishful thinking. All right, love birds. I'll go get the manager. Is that a lover's carabiner? A pair of carabiners doesn't mean it's for lovers. Who gave you that? I made it myself. You can have it, it will keep you safe. It's mine then. The first deepwater solo wall in Hong Kong was made by me. Did you ever see people turning into animals? Do you think it's rare? To survive in Hong Kong, who isn't forced to be a beast? Hey. What is your plan? I have to go up. Up where? Lion Rock. Lion Rock? Might as well go to Wudang Mountains. I'm serious. I know you are, but I'm kidding. Help me prepare for it. Stop fooling around. Are you trying to set a world record? A disabled man climbing up Lion Rock? As long as I can stand again. Do you think miracles happen in Hong Kong? Watch me climb up with my wheelchair then. All right, I'll carry you in the wheelchair. Are you looking down on me? I'm looking up to you. Doctor. Will my condition make me delusional? Theoretically, no. I see a lot of weird things. Animals. A lot of animals. Then have you seen ghosts, Avengers, zombies, and vampires as well? What's the difference between zombies and vampires? Medically speaking, vampires have a congenital genetic disorder and zombies have acquired bacterial infections. You are not delusional. Can nerves grow back? It depends, but... Medically, a miracle happens, but very rarely. The Nursing Officer was looking for you. Where were you? I went to see the doctor. Notify us if you leave the ward next time, okay? The social worker brought this. Application form for people with disabilities. Fill it in and I'll submit it for you. No, thank you. I won't be sitting all my life. Do you really think so? Yes. You're not picking up! Call me back! Hey, where are you? I'm going to the hospital with Zoe. Zoe's water broke. She's about to have the baby, she was just sent into the labor ward. I'll call you later. Mother, where is Zoe? What took you so long? You should be fast on wheels. I went to see the doctor. Who's more important, the doctor or your wife? She is giving birth without her husband around. What kind of man are you? Nurse, my wife is giving birth. Can I go in? It's not a private hospital. Of course you can't go in. Is Zoe's family here? Yes, I'm here. It's a boy, 8.5 pounds. He was born naturally. The mom and baby are fine. Don't lean in too close. Your wheelchair is not sterilized yet. Don't touch the baby. The baby needs to be examined. Come see him later. You're a dad! Are you crying? I'm sorry, my son. Your dad is a loser. Ki Tai-wai. Chu Yiu-jo, the patient next to you, was discharged and said this is for you. He said this will bring you luck. He told me to tell you to practice with this on. You can definitely walk again. Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy Stop for a second. Look at me when you say it. When you're in front of the judge, you have to look him in the eyes. That way, he'll believe you. Okay? I saw the headlights, but I don't remember anything afterward. I'm sorry. After seeing the headlights, I got hit by his car. David. As long as we know who should be blamed for this car accident, the ruling will make a direct impact on you. You can give rise to a claim. Your wife is under so much pressure. You have a young son. Everything you say in court will directly affect the lives of your family. So remember, you must follow my instructions. Okay? Okay. Good. Many said that he's a good man. He worked several jobs until late to provide for his family. He's also a good husband who loves his wife dearly and treats his children with care. He is ambitious. He works hard. He has a bright future. But a car accident changed the course of his life. Such an admirable and responsible man he is. Do you have the heart to watch him struggle in life? Objection! Your Honor! Objection for misdirection. Let me begin. Who says that in a car accident, you must lose your legs to be the victim? Not to mention his legs are still there. He just can't walk for now. How about the psychological effect it has on Yeung Wing-nam, his wife, and his ten and eight-year-old daughters? Who can judge and make comparisons? Objection! Your Honor. Objection for multiple and repetitive misdirections. Your Honor, let's save our time. He's not the only victim of this car accident. Let me help. - Thank you, I'll get on first. - Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I recognize you, you're the Bun Scrambling Champion. You're inspiring. What a hero. You're Hong Kong's pride. I'm almost completely recovered. I just need to work on my lower body. I'm already 50% recovered. That's the positivity I'm talking about. I support you. I was an athlete too for Eastern, South China, Bulova. Have you heard of them? Go ask your grandparents. - I'm sorry. - Can't you tell you had to poop? Goodness! How can I do business now? Wear a diaper! Why does it have to be me? I'm sorry. What an unlucky day. Are you kidding me? Again? Then you have to lift his legs up and wipe them with wet towels. Stop crying, baby. - Are you all right? - Yes. We're running out of tissue. You have to wipe it clean or he'll get skin inflammation. His skin is so tender. Baby, be good. I know it stinks. Just wash your hands after that. You got some big business here. Mom. Can you help? Stop crying, baby. What's wrong? Okay. Okay. You certainly picked the right time to come home. If you came back 15 minutes earlier, you'd be the one to do it. Grandma has it easy. Grandma just plays with the baby. What an easy job. I wonder if I used to change my own diaper when I was a baby. Your mom helps your dad and your dad helps you! Your dad loves you so much. Remember, you have to help your dad when you grow up. Sorry. He used to be active and athletic. He could have taken his child anywhere. He was Hong Kong's elite climber and Asian Champion. He ranked eighth in the world. He could have won a lot more awards. But an accident damaged his spine. He is paralyzed from the waist down and disabled for life. All these honors mean nothing anymore. Mr. Ki Tai-wai, can you tell us what you have lost after this accident? I'm no longer an elite athlete. I can't climb anymore. I can't work like I used to. I can't take my son out. I can't walk. I can't stand. I'll have to lift my head up to talk to people. Hong Kong's elite athlete. We'll miss that of you, Ki Tai-wai. Mr. Ki Tai-wai. Can you share with us what you gained after the accident? What can I gain? A disability card? No. You won the Ten Outstanding Young Persons Selection Awards in 2014. You have over 10,000 fans on social media. You're now a disabled celebrity. How is it? Now that you're a celebrity, do you feel different? Are you on cloud nine? "We meet beneath the Lion Rock. There will be more smiles than sobs." That's the lyrics of a song. Are you touched? Yes. There's more. I would like to thank Hong Kong for letting me find hope, allowing me to influence others with my life. - Excuse me. - Mr. Ki Tai-wai, hello. Hello. This is Mrs. Cheng, our chairperson. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Ki. Hello. Mrs. Ki, right? - Hello, Mrs. Ki. - Hello. Congratulations, Outstanding Young Person. With great identity comes great responsibility. Be a good role model to young people. They depend on you. Understood. - Hing, why don't you take a photo? - Sure. Maybe over here? - Sure. - Here. Ready. Excuse me. Excuse me. Ready. One, two, three. Okay. Thank you. - Hing. - Okay. Hong Kong needs more positivity. Keep it up. Let's talk next time. Okay. Commissioner. This is our fan page. Have you liked it? You can do it now. We'll tag you in it. Remember to leave a comment and share it tonight. Leave some positive comments. Hello. Hello. Do you want a drink? No, thank you, I have to drive. They are non-alcoholic. I'm good, thank you. I have to congratulate you too. We both got the award. Congratulations to you too. I'm Kearen Pang. I'm Ki Tai-wai. I know, you're so recognizable. I'm kidding. I don't know many people in this kind of social event. Right. - Hello. - This is my wife. - Hello, I'm Kearen Pang. - I'm Zoe. Congratulations. Thank you. I'll take a photo of you two. - Okay. - Okay. Let's take one together. - Okay. - Let's do it. One, two, three. I'm home. Mother. Mom, do you have laundry to do? - Grandma. - Hi, Angus. Knitted wear needs to be washed by hand. Do you think cooking is just putting things into a pot and doing laundry is just putting clothes into the machine? What is that? Didn't I tell you two weeks ago? - The whole family... - Ten Outstanding Young Persons Awards? Yes, a lot of government officials were there. So it's like those MTV Awards they give out to everyone? Be careful. It's your dad's hard-earned award. Don't bite. It's plastic. You can't eat it. Your mom doesn't want me to talk. Let me get changed first. I'll buy you ice cream later. Yes! You are a fighter. And he? He's nobody. Influence others with love and life. Because of you, the lives of my client's family have turned around. Do you know how much others have lost because of your love for a motorcycle? Help him to the bed. Let me take a look. Besides this accident, he also has some old injuries from climbing. When was this taken? Half a year ago. Doctor, here's the latest one. Okay, get off the bed. It's all right. He won't be able to walk again. Can't he do physiotherapy, spa, chemotherapy, or something? He can handle it. He can take a lot of pain. Can you at least examine his legs first? He can't walk because his spinal nerves are permanently damaged. Why don't you examine his wound? That's not necessary. You didn't even spend two minutes looking at him and you say he can never walk again? From a medical standpoint, yes. Thank you, doctor. Let's go. How about here? Nothing yet. How about here? Nothing yet. Are you mad? You can kill him! Don't move him! See! He's healing. He looks so much better. Keep going. Help him up first. Can you really do it? Your godmother loves you. She's my coach. She always looks after me. Then keep it up. Don't disappoint her. So do you. You're funny. This is my miracle potion. Boil it into a bowl, the thicker the better. Drink a bowl every two hours. I guarantee you'll be walking in a month and you'll be playing football in three months. Since you're referred by a friend, I'll charge 75,000 dollars. Chinese Medicine Practitioner, Wong Wan-lau Only friends get this discounted price. Look at you. A young man with a bright future and a handsome face too. What a shame you have to roam around in a chair. Any girl would be heartbroken if they saw you. Come back next week. Keep working on it. Climb Mount Everest one day and impress everyone. Cash or credit card? I can't take it. I need to rest. Didn't you rest enough? Just let me rest for five minutes. You need to rest even with this wall. If you climb Lion Rock, you'll need three days. It's only the first day I start training again. Gosh, look at how weak you are. How can you climb again? It's over. I want to eat strawberry sundae. Hello. Here's my document. Okay. Can you tell us why you have to apply for the Sports Scholarship Scheme? You may begin. I am a Hong Kong representative in rock climbing. I rank eighth worldwide, top three nationwide. I'm going to represent Hong Kong to compete in the World Championship in Prague. I plan to break my personal best record and surpass my current ranking. So I'm applying for the Athlete Support Scheme. Excuse me. Are you listening? You rank eighth? That's my world ranking. That means you're not in the top three. I am, nationwide. But you rank eighth worldwide. I'm going to compete in the World Championship. Rock climbing? I won the Asian Championship before. This is not an Olympic event, right? I don't think so. That means even if we let you represent Hong Kong in rock climbing, even if you win, we don't know who we should send to congratulate you. Also, where is your proof of salary? You only have a printout of your address. We need the original. There's no certificate of no criminal conviction. You failed to provide a lot of documents. Why don't you compete in the Asian Games, the Olympics, or play a more well-known sport? I'm talking about sports. And you're talking about documents? When we compete abroad, no matter how well we do, what our rankings are, we are all Hong Kong athletes. You've been playing with your phones since I came in. And you're still playing! Why are you wearing suits? Respect yourself! I'm here for government funding, not to ask you for a loan! Call the next one in. I know some people from my dad. Maybe they'll be interested to sponsor you. It's rock climbing. How many people know about it? It's not the Premiere League. I have a mutual fund that has been sitting there for years. It didn't make any money anyway. Why don't you use it? I'd be ridiculed for using a girl's money. It's just a couple thousand dollars. Wait till I win the World Championship... I found some budget flight tickets last night. It only costs 1,000 dollars to Osaka or Tokyo. That's pretty cheap. But I didn't get it in time. They are all sold out. Maybe next time. I'll buy them next time. We should ask Man, Suet-ying, and Cat to go to Japan with us. Sure. The more, the merrier. Ask your girlfriend to come along next time. Whoever loses needs to answer a question. Let's do one round. I choose paper. What are you doing? Stop fishing them out. Stop fishing them out! Let go! Stop fishing them out! Why did you have to mock me? Yes, I have a girlfriend. But I've always liked you. Now you know it. You just want to embarrass me. I like being with you, but that doesn't mean we have to date. I want us to be honest soulmates instead of couples that lie to each other. Just as I like climbing, I think it's just a chapter in my life. There are a lot of places I want to go and a lot of things I want to do. Are you mad at me? Yes. Because I like you being honest. Not now. Not anymore. Hey, why are you two here again? We're leaving. You'd better be. You don't own this place. I'm leaving. Bye. Mr. Ki, you can do it. - You can stand up again. - Mrs. Yeung. - You'll be fine. - You can't talk to the witness. I made you some soup. - Chicken soup. - Mrs. Yeung. - You can't talk to the witness. - It's delicious. - You can definitely walk again. - Do you hear me? - Mr. Yeung. - You'll walk again very soon. Mr. Yeung. You can't talk to the witness. My wife loves making soup. Would you like some too? I can charge you for perverting the course of justice. - Please leave. - Mr. Ki. Have some soup, you'll walk soon. - Try it, have some. - Honey. - It spilled everywhere. - Why did you pull me? You're such a loser. - No! - What have you done after all that? - No! - He can't drink the soup! I don't know what you did. My soup is over there. - He needs to drink some soup! What is it? - Please leave. - Thank you. - Excuse us. Mr. Yeung Wing-nam, please hold the steering wheel for me. Okay. So you're used to holding the wheel with one hand? How about the gear lever? Does that mean you usually hold the wheel with one hand? No, it takes no time to shift the gear. Also, do you usually check the mirror from this side or this side? Of course I check the mirrors on both sides. Don't you have a driver's license? Mr. Yeung, you're funny. Mr. Yeung. Your younger daughter is calling. Do you have a bad relationship with her? No. Pick it up then. As you can see, on the night of the accident, Mr. Yeung picked up a call from his daughter. According to his phone record, the conversation lasted 1 minute, 22 seconds. Thank you. Phone. Do you like it? Then keep it. I'm sorry, Attorney. Workers like us can be careless. Excuse me. We drivers are ill-mannered sometimes. No, I'm not talking on behalf of all drivers. I'm only talking about myself, you know... Dads like us... Your Honor, my client is too emotional, we request a break. Let me finish! As a dad, of course I pick up right away when my daughters call. Do people like them understand us? I work over ten hours every day. Do you think that's easy? I'm just trying to make a living. It's okay if I starve, but I won't let it happen to my wife and daughters. Do you know how expensive groceries are now? Do you know how much my rent is? We can't use public hospital services or live in public housing. Even when the city has a surplus, I can't benefit from it! Look at me, although I'm a useless dad, I still want my two daughters to have more education. Your children get to have proper education and learn everything and travel everywhere on vacation. What about us? What about my children? I can only work two more shifts and make more money for their education. I... I don't always pick up phone calls when I drive. Not always. When the accident happened, I wasn't on the phone. Attorney. I'm begging you! Just let me go, okay? I can't afford to pay! Where do I get the money? Don't you know? I just want to be a good dad. A court is a place of justice. No matter what he said, it won't affect my verdict. Hey! Hold the pen a bit higher. It's crooked. Erase it and start all over. One more bite before you continue. Good girl. - Swallow it. - Come on, let's ignore her. Let's continue with homework. - Here, 3 times 5 is 15, 3 times 6 is 18. - Let's go in. What is three times seven? Mr. Ki, how old were you when you got your driver's license? I was 18. How many times have you taken the exam? Three times. Have you ever parked illegally, driven dangerously, or had points deducted? Yes, no, and yes. Do you think that's funny? This is the court. You're humiliating yourself. I'm not trying to be funny. Okay. So you have parked illegally and gotten points deducted. Why did you lose your points? I got caught speeding and I drove in the wrong lane. You don't like to follow traffic rules, do you? I couldn't brake quickly enough. - I overlooked, so I was in the wrong lane. - Do you do that often? I was rushing to work. So you were in a hurry? No one wants to go to work late. You were on your way home at Tuen Mun Road, a road you must be familiar with. Why did you change lanes twice in only 1 km? Changing lanes is normal. Did you put your blinkers on? Yes. Are you sure? You must answer this question. Did you put your blinkers on? May I ask, what were you doing before the accident? I was going to get my wife a cake. May I ask, what were you doing before the accident? I was going to get my wife a cake. May I ask, what were you doing before the accident? Didn't I tell you? I've told you many times in the past six months, in all circumstances, when they ask, you must say you put the blinkers on before changing lanes, right? Yes. If you said you had put them on before changing lanes, you would have won the case. Am I wrong? No. If they were to blame, you'd be able to claim your loss. Am I wrong? No, you're not. Then what's wrong with you? You said you didn't remember in court. We were about to win this case, but you didn't listen to me and acted selfishly. You almost got your claim. Then your wife wouldn't have to be the breadwinner, earning just 16,300 dollars to raise your family of three. You're living off your mother-in-law. Claim? Don't even think about it. Are you scared now? Angus, stop playing. Put your clothes on. I already bathed him. Can you help put his clothes on? Okay, I'm sorry. Have you ever taken care of your son? Have you looked after your family or me? Back in court, why did you say you didn't remember? I can't lie. I can't. I think if I... It's all about you! What about me? Sorry. I haven't had much sleep lately. I'm tired. Go play. You haven't showered yet. I'll help you get some clothes for a shower. That shirt should be clean. How is it? Are you ready? I don't need your help. I got this. Without me, you wouldn't know what you're doing. I didn't ask you for help. Then I'm not helping you. If you manage to climb up there, you can still call yourself a fighter. If you don't, you're just a disabled person. I don't need you to remind me! Why are you mad? Do disabled people embarrass you? Is it too harsh? You can't take it? I'm not disabled. I'm just using my experience to tell others that I never gave up. And I influence others with my life. Who are you helping? They are all capable. Who do you think you are? Just because you can't walk, the others have to listen to you? What? Is it because you were an athlete? One of the TOYP? That's your story, what about the others? No one needs your help. They just want to hear your story. Your real-life story. Enough. Stop talking. I'm not a fighter, okay? Okay. See? That's what you were like before. I already said it, I'm not... Just shut up! This is the difference between me and you. I admit it. I'm disabled. You are nothing but a disabled person. It's your gold medal. Don't you treasure it? You're still cleaning up? You have work tomorrow. You can't be late. Wake up early and make yourself breakfast tomorrow. You've been climbing for so long, but your medals can't even fill a plastic bag. Don't waste it. Do you want the medals? I mean the plastic bag. Take them to the kitchen and throw them away later. Hurry and take a shower. Go to bed early after dinner tonight. You can't be late when you work for me. Don't drag it, please! What did my floor do to you and your wheelchair? Let me do it. It's okay. What are you doing? This teddy bear is too dirty. Does Angus know? Kids forget quickly. It's just a bit dirty. It will be fine after washing. Do you know what this shirt lacks? I know. It doesn't have folds. Wear your glasses. It doesn't have zippers. I'm not talking to you. It's a non-woven fabric. Good. This shirt doesn't have a pocket for your phone. So everyone, please put away your phones. What's the matter? I want to put something inside. Your wheelchair won't fit, let me do it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for your help. Thank you. Thank you. Next time, pay more attention to... - There is a new shop nearby. Let's go? - Sure. Lunchtime has ended. Let's go together. Maybe tomorrow. Go now. - Bye. - Bye. Is that your girlfriend? No, I'm just helping a colleague. Your students are lucky to have you. Go study again then. Being an athlete didn't make money anyway. Even if you are a good office assistant, what good does it make? So? You're not a boy anymore. How does a sewing machine work? Everyone has their body flaws. Not everyone can carry the same shirt. It's the designer's responsibility to solve problems and change how people see you. Any questions? I don't know what questions to ask. Can you explain it again? It's late, were you training? No. Come and eat first. Why is he crying? He has been crying all day. Mom and I haven't eaten yet. What's wrong? Forget it, he's having a tantrum about the bear I threw away. Let me see. Not bad. But it's not my cup of tea. You have... a lot of room for improvement. Think about it yourself. Is he asleep? He has been asleep for a while. How's work? Everyone at school is nice. Good thing I have this electric wheelchair. I think they like me. They have a human conveyor belt now. Quit if you're not happy at work. Don't worry about my mom. Does everyone in school like my mom? Actually, her students really like her. She's always nice. You're the one who thought poorly of her. If I could stand up again, what do you think I'd be doing now? Perhaps I would be one of the top three world's best climbers. If I was lucky, with a couple more years, I would get my first Olympic gold medal in climbing. By then, everyone would know me. But that's pointless. I wouldn't be a good dad. I shouldn't have told them I forgot. I didn't think about you. I regret it. But don't worry. I'll do my best at this job and make more money. I don't want you to suffer anymore. I won't fantasize about standing up. I won't climb again. I'm tired. I just want a break. I'm tired too. I didn't know being a wife was this hard. If I could choose again, I would never choose you. If I could choose again, I would definitely choose you. I've changed. I'm like a teddy bear now. I'm scared that you don't want me. Climb again and be yourself. I don't want to. Climb again and be yourself. Don't you know that Lion Rock is a grade-five climb? The peak rises over 100 m from the bottom. You're climbing with your bare hands. You'll be ascending on every route. How about the weather? It's too humid up there. Do you know how dangerous it is to climb in your wheelchair? I know. You're a better climber than I am, but as a coach, it's my responsibility to tell you that safety comes first. Be my belayer then. I don't approve of this at all. Don't forget, the insurance I bought for you is for saving, not life insurance. I invested in you, but I never thought I'd have to claim it. Don't look at me like this. I won't help you. Don't even think about it. Hey. I broke many records on this wall. I'm familiar with every climbing hold. But now, I have nothing. A few nights ago, I dreamed that I could stand and I was climbing in the jungle. Did you manage to climb up? I woke up. You don't believe it when people say you can't. And you don't try when they say you can. Try what? Do you know what she said to me? She supports me. She admires me. Positivity. It's all talk. They all say the same thing! Do we need her approval to climb Lion Rock? - Hey. - What? If you drop it, you have to pick it up. Are you crazy? Aren't we the same person? Whatever. Don't just say it. Do it. Dusk and dawn are the same to me Should I persist or give up? Will my role in life make a difference? Every day I just work, breathe, and live Guarding this mighty fortress alone I look up to the sky window Your husband is here for you. Get off work early. You must be tired after work. Just go home and rest. We already sold the car. You don't have to come to pick me up. Who says I need a car to pick my wife up? All it takes is my sincerity. And the battery. I don't need to see higher skies and farther seas No matter how high and far, just step forward From dusk till dawn, keep it to yourself Looking back from the exit Passing through this window, I know where I'm going Don't think, don't back down, don't feel upset Even if you get shot, it'll only... Go get the ball. Hurry up! Hang on or fall down I can't climb over the wall Surviving alone in this epic time In the crowd, I'm not upset Don't cry, don't be afraid of nightmares Even if you cry, it won't change bad luck Climb through every struggle and obstacle Weaving the dreams and fantasies You always wish for It's a beautiful handwriting. A kiss for you. Go play. Lion Rock Hey. You said climbing is exciting. I really don't feel it. It's too easy. If it's that easy, I have to be a Bun Scrambling Champion too. I'll be the Asian Champion as well. I'll get you an Olympic gold medal too. You're weak! Hang on or fall down Fear not the wall Surviving in this epic time In the crowd, I'm not upset Hey, are you all right? What's wrong with you? Aren't you a champion? You barely climbed. That was awesome. I haven't fallen like this in so long. I'll call an ambulance. Okay, thank you. You're laughing? Did you hit your head? Thank goodness you fell into the pool. If you fell while climbing Lion Rock, we wouldn't be able to save you, fool. I'm an athlete again! You're still screaming? Do I need to take you to see a psychiatrist? Silly. Stop laughing. You scared me. Prestigious estate Available for viewing, 33 million dollars It's important to commute easily. You need convenient transportation. You'll save more if you have a car. The parking fee is 20% cheaper than that of the same area. The building might be a little old, but... Zoe, your phone is ringing. - Hello, Mr. Ho. - Mr. Tong. Let's look at the listings. Honey? What's wrong? Honey, are you busy today? I have to take a client to an open house later, what is it? I'm climbing Lion Rock today. When I'm up there, I'll take more photos for you. Be careful. I'll call you when I'm up there, bye. Bye. - Do you have kids? - Not yet. That's better. They don't have to suffer from the education system here. - But the second-hand prize is fixed. - I'll take over. Mr. Ho. This is a 28-year-old apartment. It looks old, but the rooms are spacious. Most importantly, it's suitable for you. You can see the school here. The sun doesn't set on this side. It has a good view and you can see Lion Rock... Oliver. Look at him. Coach. Rockfall! Cover your head! Ki Tai-wai, are you all right? I'm afraid. I'm afraid I can't climb up. Then I'll carry you down. Do you know why I always want to climb? I always told myself, it wouldn't matter even if I fell. I had nothing left to live for anyway. But I'm afraid now because many people still love me. Oliver. Tell my wife, I'm thankful for her. To: Dad Wear your helmet and be a hero. Love, Mom Don't be afraid. It's just turbulence. That's why your rope keeps turning. Hang on to the rope. Once the wind subsides, it will be fine. You can neither see the peak nor get down. No one can help you. Why do you want to climb? You can't even climb up this 7 m wall. - A 500 m mountain... - What about it? Miracles won't happen if I sit here all my life. It's good that there's wind. I can rest for a bit. I'm okay now. - Oliver, are you okay there? - Let's go! What's happening up there? Why is it pulling against me? Oliver, let go of that rope. That rope will keep you safe. I can't let go. It's pressing on me, I can't get up. Let it go! Honey. Stop climbing, come down. Don't worry, honey. I still have a rope. It's safe. What would I do if anything happens to you again? I survived even when a big truck hit me. It proves that I'm lucky. Listen to me! Get down! Designers know what looks best on them. They don't follow trends blindly. TOYP is like a set of clothes, so is being a fighter, a dad, or a husband. Only you know what works for you. Faith. You've got to have faith. Honey. I'm so close to succeeding. I'll listen to you after this. I'll be a good dad and a good husband. My mission is completed. Don't go. Climb with me. I'm nothing but your past. I have to let you go here. So... you have to let me go too. The second half of the match is all yours. I really can't do it. Remember the first time we climbed the bun mountain? When life is crazy When life is twisted Don't cry, don't feel discouraged Don't give up I hope I will forever stay with you When life is crazy I will forever stay with you. On December 9th, 2011, Lai Chi-wai became paralyzed from the waist down after a car accident. After six months of training, he climbed up a 500 m mountain in 6 hours. On the same day 5 years later, December 9th, the wind blows under the sun. He is back on Lion Rock.
