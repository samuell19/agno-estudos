Please turn off your phone. Everything's for sale in this world. Give him another 100 million. I want to buy a noble title, too. How much does a title of an English baron cost? Buy me that. The one which the queen of England will bestow on me in person. Famous planner. Xia Zhi. Is your dad really a badass? - Actually... - Xiao Tian. Don't talk bullshit like your dad. Your dad is just an ordinary Beijinger. But he talks like he runs Beijing. It takes less energy just to tell the truth. Why do you work so hard to make up lies? You're a bullshit artist. All I know is that cheap stuff comes with low quality. That's why your mom dumped your dad. We should be nicer to Xiao Tian. She's already an orphan. What? My mom and dad are alive. It's called single parenting. The doctor says your dad has a disease. He's a pathological liar. [Iraq] [Baghdad] Do you know how much money Saddam had? He had enough cash to pay off the US debt and solve the European debt crisis and still have some left over. Believe me. The Americans admitted to it. Where is the money right now? Who's Saddam? That Saddam took all of his gold and buried it across Iraq. Only he and his sons knew where it was. The problem is... the Americans weren't careful and they ended up killing them all. Since then the treasure has been lost. I've been carefully combing over every speech Saddam gave after coalition forces attacked Iraq. The secret Saddam left has been uncovered. I am about to find it! You're going to be rich. The money belongs to the Iraqi people. Do you believe him? No. Then why are you clapping? Sometimes lies are more provocative than the truth. [Really!!!] Long time no see. I've missed you. I've missed you, too. I heard you met someone. You have to tell me when good things happen. It's not true. Boss Lady! Coming! Here, have a drink with us. Cheers. Me, too. Come on. Why are you rushing? Why are you drinking for her? Xia Zhi named this restaurant. He is also the decoration designer Don't you think that's strange? This place has got a Boss Lady. There's no boss though. I'll drink with you guys. Drink! Wait a sec. It's no fun if he drinks by himself. How about they drink cross-cupped? Come on Boss Lady. I'll drink. I'm not scared. Cheers. What's going on? Don't run away! What did you see? A kidnapping. Kidnapping? Really? That's right. Pour me some. Those three guys that just passed by the guy in the middle was being kidnapped. When three guys huddle together it's a crime or they're gay. When the guy being kidnapped threw me a glance, I saw two things in his eyes: Fear... and despair. What if they were just gay? He's too hideous to be gay. Then why didn't you save him? He didn't yell "help." He definitely wasn't just a normal guy. - Where is he? - Sir, your takeaway. Somewhere nearby. Sir, I... What are you talking about? Did you say this to get out of drinking with me? Not bad. Who was that guy? Undercover? No. How do you know? If he was an undercover officer, after all the years I've spent in prison, I'd smell him from three blocks away. If you saw someone being kidnapped, what would your first reaction be? Nothing. What would a normal person do? Call the police! - Turn a blind eye. - Call the police. They will definitely call the police. Are you nuts? Nobody wants trouble. Have you ever been educated? It's the public's responsibility. Cut it. I've never been educated I'm telling you... If something really happens how many people would actually stand up? Are you finished?! - Boss. - Boss, it has been three hours. Nobody is looking for him. Maybe... he didn't report it. Or maybe the police don't care. If the police really didn't care, there would be more and more criminals every day. Or would there be less? Did your mom tell you to give me this? I stole it. I need to tell you something. We're going to Australia. When are you coming back? We aren't coming back. We're emigrating. Why haven't I heard about this? I'm telling you now. I don't approve. How could your mom just...? Who is that? Mom's new boyfriend. He's the one taking us to Sydney. Goodbye, Dad! Don't run! Slow Down! Credit [3,000 Mu of a Happy Life] Geez. Why'd you park like this? It's perfect for me. You have a partner, don't you? Who is he? Who? Okay, let's back up. Where's the stuff? I gave you a simple task. Pick up the stuff and deliver it. ¬•300,000. Easy money. You can't just take the stuff and run. Tell me where it is and I'll go easy on you. with another ¬•20,000 or‚Ä¶ You know better than me how much it's worth. One million. Ten million. Our first round of funding. I'm not asking for much. Just ten million. Don't listen to him. I am not that capable. We don't need an investment. So off we go. See you Let's go. How'd it go? I'm hopeful. You think he'll give you ten million for a few words You're daydreaming. Over the next ten years, products will still exist but delivery men will replace salesmen. Food will remain but delivery services will replace restaurants. Movies will still exist but they are only the spiritual fulfillment of artistic young people. and watch movies wherever they are. We can't change the world, but we can change with the world. That makes sense. I only had takeout food for that past two weeks. You are truly insightful. A lot of people aren't afraid of death. They're afraid of pain. Everything you say is a joke. Everything I say is true. What about the kidnapping you were talking about yesterday? The drug trafficking group kidnapping one of their own. Why do you want to know? Are you one of them? The hostage is dead. I asked about him. That guy is a bullshit artist. All he does is talk nonsense all day. How do you know he's talking nonsense? He said the hostage died. Does that sound like nonsense? He... He's right. Zhang Guangxian. He... really is dead. Now it's 1.5 million! It should be considered self-defense. Accidental homicide. It was Zhang Guangxian who started the fight. Legitimate self-defense. Would he start the fight if we hadn't kidnapped him? Shut up. Who cares if he's dead? The stuff? The stuff?! We're screwed. The only person who knew where it was is dead now. You're right. I don't need you to tell me that! Without the stuff, how am I going to pay him back? I didn't even tell you about this. How did Xia know? Xia Zhi is Zhang Guangxian's partner. No way. He would have tried to save him. He probably is his partner. Now that Zhang Guangxian is dead, he can pocket the stuff himself. When I was young, my mom bought me a book of riddles. But I couldn't guess any of them. My mom said I was too stupid. She beat me. After that. I stole the book and ripped it up. It was gone. Then she couldn't force me to guess anymore. We've already killed one person. If we kill another person, it doesn't matter! Kill... Kill who? Xia Zhi. Why do you want to kill him? I think the priority should be getting rid of Zhang Guangxian. He didn't report it anyway. He didn't report it yesterday or today, but what if he reports it tomorrow? What if he changes his mind someday? Anyway, now that he has something on me. I won't be able to sleep well. I agree. Xia Zhi! I bought this for Xiao Tian. Bought it on a whim. Credit Who? You. Ma'am look at how uncivilized this is. I need to deal with you first. Young man, you're littering cigarette butts everywhere. I have to fine you. Ma'am, someone is trying to kill me. Why don't you go after him? When I'm done with you, I'll go after him. Pay me. Hey! What? How much? Fine. Where are you going?! I'm warning you, don't run. Ma'am, did you set this up? Huh? Just because of a cigarette butt, you're dropping flower pots on me. - Hurry and pay me so I can go catch him. - Okay. Okay, here's your ticket. Next time don't run. Xiao Tian. Xiao Xue bought you this dress. You didn't kill him? It's a little difficult. So you just gave up? This... How long of a sentence will I get if I kill someone after drunk driving? Seven years at most. Are you sure? If you plead guilty, three years. Do it. There's an accident A wreck. An accident. A wreck. Ma'am, this bill is missing a corner. Give me a new one. Let me see. The police are here. Let the police handle it. Officer! Officer! I just saw it. The car came from there and crashed here. Is this Xia Zhi guy some sort of cat? Does he have nine lives? This is Xia Zhi's address. He's divorced and lives alone. Again? What's wrong? Xiao Tian can stay and live with me. No way. He's back. No explosion. Tomorrow the headlines will read, "Xia Zhi died of gas poisoning here's the warning for all citizens." Pick me up! Go play. No smell. His gas is turned off. Of course, he wasn't poisoned. What is wrong with this asshole? [China Construction Bank] Please add 300 to this natural gas account. Wait one second. 500. Do you have a card? No, isn't cash okay? Gas card. Oh, gas card. He must die today! I've never met such a cheap murderer. Don't even bother to buy a knife Why waste money? This one just needs to be sharpened. What is so urgent? You didn't tell me you were coming. I didn't know I had to tell you when I come over. They're back. Don't you have a key? I lost it. Look at you Kill both of them? You want to kill his whole family? Hide. Wait. It'll move. You made it move more. If you don't like Sydney, you can come back and live with me. Live with you? No way! It's so messy here. Before, Mom made you sleep on the couch. You live alone now. Why do you still sleep here? Used to it? The bed is broken. Get up! Get up. Dad, how long have you been with Xiao Xue? That's none of your business. Your girlfriend might become my stepmother some day. When I go to Sydney, you'll rely on her for all of your happiness. Of course, it's my business. If you stay then I'll be happy. Dad, when are you going to have a baby with Xiao Xue? Don't talk nonsense. If you have another kid, you won't miss me so much. Dad, I hope you have a baby soon. Xiao Tian, what are you doing? Nothing. What are you really doing? How is the bed broken? Come on! I told you it was broken! You don't listen. Are you okay? I'm okay. How long has it been since you've slept on it? Come on don't ask me that. It's so dusty. Mom told me to drink hot water. How can I boil water without gas? I came to pick up Xiao Tian. You're her mom's...? I'm her mom's... Are you going to Sydney to hide from me? No. The air is good and the education, too. It sounds like you're a child abductor. It's all for your daughter's own good. Sounds like it's all for her mom's own good. Xiao Tian, are you ready to go? Bye, Dad. Goodbye. Credit Are they gone? Catch! Where do you think you are going? What are you you doing? Come here! - Mr. Xia? - Who are you? This is Ms. Wu from the real estate agency. Be quick and help me call the police! Stop kidding around. Someone made an offer on your apartment for ¬•3.7 million. ¬•3.7 million for this crappy place? Houses in Beijing are too expensive. 50,000 per square meter isn't expensive. He should sell for that price. Money is king. Location is king. Listen to me! The prices will continue to go up for another 10 years. I wouldn't sell until it hits 100,000 per square meter. 100,000? I won't make that much in three lifetimes. Go back to prison then. Live for free. You've got a point, Bro. From the current evidence, there's no way to prove that hard fighting had taken place in your house two hours ago. You don't believe me? We believe the evidence. It's really messy look. It was messy a little while ago. Besides you and your daughter's fingerprints, there's no trace of anyone else being here. This was just upside down. How is it standing upright again? There should be fruit everywhere. They even fixed the bed. The hitmen are better at cleaning than killing. They are professionals. Who are they? He called the police. Are you happy now? Why do they want to kill you? You made us do it. You still think this is funny? We wore masks. Nobody could recognize us. Use your brain. He knows you kidnapped Zhang Guangxian. He aslo knows you killed him, and knows we're after him. If the two hitmen do exist, they must really have it out for you; otherwise, they wouldn't risk it. I haven't done anything to anyone. He knows us like the back of his hand. But he can't know about the stuff. Forget it. Hey! There's another possibility. Recently I've been investigating Saddam's lost gold. Who? Saddam Hussein from Iraq. Maybe al-Qaeda is after me. They didn't take anything else. They just took a few pages from my notebook. Those notes will lead them to the treasure. Oh! Xia Zhi! Why are you here? It's my old classmate. What's up? You drink a lot. That's not a crime. At worst, your wife can't stand you. You talk a lot of shit. That isn't a crime either. At worst, people will stop talking to you someday. But coming here and making false reports, that is a crime. It's called "interfering with official business." I'm telling the truth. You know me, don't you? It's because I know you too well. This is the first time I've let a guest stay this late. I'm sorry. Actually, I'm... No. I'm too scared to go home. But I'm also not too scared. It's just that... Your taste... is similar to mine. Do it again. I should probably go home. It's not safe for me to stay. Are you afraid I'll eat you? Hey! Why are you lying here? I'm fine. I'm fine. Slow down. I'm scared. Scared of what? Can I stay here tonight? Where will you stay? There's no bed for you. Just open one of the cells. I'll sleep in a cell. Do it for your old pal. Give me a room for the night. Boss, all is well. I went to the place we stayed at and sat there all night. I didn't see any police come. This Xia Zhi guy, he knows we want to kill him. He reported us, but the police aren't looking for us and nobody was sent to protect Xia Zhi. Why is that? Boss, maybe they are waiting to catch the big fish. I've never used this gun before. I'm giving it to you. He gave it to you first. This fat guy must have been fatter in college. He was thinner in the middle school, but still the fattest kid in school. He was born eight and a half pounds. Less than 0.37% of murderers are fat guys. He's safe. I'm only going to eat here for the next two days. If I don't show up, it means the bad guys have caught me. I haven't caught you yet. They'll have to wait. Believe me. I'm telling the truth. Okay. You're telling the truth. I'm telling you you have to come and eat here every night. No days off! Credit Drinking like that. Shirt buttoned wrong. Was definitely fooling around with his girlfriend. He can't contain his excitement. This guy is celebrating for himself. Not much experience with women. He looks sure of himself. A man with responsibilities. Doesn't make mistakes. He'll be married in two years. People leading a happy life won't become a hitman He's safe. Fake bag. Fake ring. Such a short dress. This girl is ambitious. Borrowed her shoes from her roommate. Just got back from the wholesale market. She's a girl from another city looking for an opportunity. Lives in a small apartment with other girls. Her only goal is to sink her hooks into a rich guy. She can flirt but not kill. Safe. This face... Wait! There's something about him. He looks familiar. Holding a newspaper, but he's not reading it. He keeps folding it. It might be something He's hiding his left hand in the paper. What's he holding? A gun? Maybe. It is a gun. I think it's pointed at me. He's aiming it at me. If I was a murderer, this would be the perfect time. He's about to fire it. Oh my god! It was just like in the movies. He had a silencer. Okay, that's enough. Even if he had a silencer, that wouldn't mean there was no sound. I didn't hear. Sir, you were next to me. Did you hear anything? Describe what the gunshot sounded like. Wrong. It had a silencer. Wrong. Bullshit. This is what bullshit sounds like. Okay, enough. Enough. Who else saw the murderer? No. Go and check the bullet trajectory. Okay. Yes. That's it. That's the sound. Enough! A bullet can't just vanish. Here you are. Here you are. There's no trace of it. We found no evidence of a gunshot. That's impossible. You'll find it. You're professionals. Let's go. Murderer! Murderer! Was the kidnapping story you told yesterday true? The hostage is dead. What did you say? You scared everyone away. I get it now. They are a criminal gang. The kidnapping. Killing the hostage. I saw it all. So they are trying to shut me up. Who was kidnapped? I don't know. And they killed the hostage? Definitely. Where's the body? I don't know. It must be near the diner. Hey! How do you know? Just a guess. Xia Zhi come here. We have recorded everything you just told us. Thank you for trusting us. If we find out anything, we'll let you know. Someone is after me. I'm risking my life to help you catch them. But you guys won't help me. We have no evidence that your life is in danger. I'm a dead man and all you care about is evidence. You're too dogmatic. Our job is based on evidence. Sergeant Li. Come and have a look Okay. How about I find you a psychiatrist? What? Can I stay overnight? Dad. Zhigang called me that you were scared of going home. How old are you? If Xiao Tian hadn't cried, I wouldn't have helped. Just one night. Sleep on the couch. I guess I'll be going. You don't live here? No. I sometimes sleep there, too. You're still not getting any. What? I said it was nice seeing you. I'm leaving. Dad, is there really someone trying to kill you? Do you believe me? Xiao Tian go to bed. Go. Goodnight. This guy... He knew I was trying to shoot him, so he ducked his head. Something so serious, why don't the police care? It's like a cat playing with its prey. I think the police are giving us an opportunity. Letting us turn ourselves in, so we can receive lighter sentences. It doesn't matter if I die as long as I make sure Xia Zhi dies before me. You slept well. Not like a guy who is about to die. You don't want to be too tired before you're killed. Xiao Tian, you sometimes tell lies too, huh? Mom says I'm a little bit like you. Everyone tells lies. It's not easy to tell the truth your whole life. But it's even harder to tell lies your whole life. I talk shit sometimes, telling a few lies is only to get people's attentions, to get people to look at me. It's harmless. But I'm not stupid. Who would want to mess with the police? Dad, I believe you. They've tried to kill me multiple times with no luck. If it were you, what would you do? You can't give up. If it's just us two, we don't have a chance. The police can help. We need the police to catch them in the act. Credit They took the bait. Wait for my call. Stick to the plan. Hurry! [Police] What's wrong with you? You broke it. Don't run! - There! - Let's go. What are you doing? The bras got good quality is what you always want to buy? It's nice. It's really thin. It must be really comfortable. And breathable. Are you nuts? My dad is trying to lure the snake out of its hole. Then you guys can catch him in the act. Do you believe what your dad says? Hello. We have "buy one get one" today It's a real bargin. Have a try. Here you go. I am breaking up with you. Darling listen to me. What the hell are you doing? Tell Mr.Han to come over. Where are you? I'm in SOHO. The street behind. It's quiet here. No bystanders will get hurt. Be here at 4:30. When you get here, I'll draw them out. This is the men's room. Shut up. You stand to pee? Wanna see? Crazy. I saw that garbage cart come this way. Yeah. Where could he possibly go? Houzi! Let's go! [Police] Sorry, the number you have dialed is not answering. Sorry‚Äî Hey! Occupied. Hey, let me borrow your phone. You... Pervert! Pervert! He's a pervert. It's time. Where's your dad? Xiao Tian! Are you trying to die? Xiao Tian! Xiao Tian here! Here! Xiao Tian! Here! Xiao Tian. Dad! Anyone here? Anyone? Anyone here? Who are you talking to? You don't get it. Let me explain it to you. Two guys tried to kill me. One of them burst in here and hit his head on the toilet. Hey, kid, come here. Go in there. I knocked the other one out. He was lying here. Come here. Lie down. I ran into his chest and was almost knocked out too. But I woke up. My cell phone was broken and their phones had passwords. What could I do? I wanted to drag him to the police station, but he was too heavy. You two can go. So I went to find you guys. When we came back. They were gone. They ran away. Do you believe him? Yes. People have the right to call the police. They don't have the right to make fun of them Dad, I'm going. This is the men's room. I'm telling you the truth! Xiao Tian! Dad! Dad! Sorry, the number you have dialed can not be answered. Sorry‚Äî Xiao Tian! Xiao Tian! Xiao Tian! I didn't lie to you. He shot at me. They're a team. They're part of a gang. They're... These shoes. His... Daddy didn't lie to you. It's too obvious those two work together. Who are you? Who are you?! I'm Xia Zhi. What do you do? I'm a famous planner. Were you the one that planned the Olympic Games? In my neighborhood, I was the one who planned the Rio Olympic Game support events of Beijing people. Tell me. How did you discover us? Huh? How did you know we kidnapped Zhang Guangxian? How did you know we killed Zhang Guangxian? Huh? What else do you know? Huh? You're gonna die. Did you know that?! Speak! I'm telling you the truth. I made it all up. Sorry for causing you trouble. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just let my daughter go, okay? It's true. My dad is just a bullshit artist. My mom divorced him because of it. The doctor said he has a disease. He's a pathological liar. I didn't know that you guys actually did what I said you did. It's just a coincidence. I just like to make up stories sometimes. This is the first time one of them has been true. It's just a coincidence. You don't think we'll kill you, do you? Or do you think I'm an idiot?! I don't care who you are. I don't care how much you know. I want to know where the stuff is! Now. Mommy! Don't! You have reasons to kill me. Don't kill my daughter. If you kill me, you're just a monster. There are many monsters in the world. But if you kill my daughter, then you're worse than a monster. [The French: Fresh&Homemade: Bakefield] Let's talk this through. You can't alert the police. How would the police know? If her mom calls and she doesn't answer, she'll be worried. She'll definitely notify the police. The police will start looking for her. Also, she's wearing a smart watch. They will know exactly where we are. For everyone's safety, we should make a call and tell her we're safe. If her mom is at ease, then everyone is safe. Hello. Where are you? Xiao Tian needs to come home. I took her to my cousin's house to play. I'll bring her back tomorrow. No worries. What is he talking about? What cousin? Isn't his cousin already dead? What? Xia Zhi's cousin. He died five years ago. Who did you guys say you killed? Zhang Guangxian. Are you sure Zhang Guangxian is dead? What are you talking about? Maybe he's not dead. Idiot. Not dead? Try to wake him up. Are you sure that's Zhang Guangxian? How do you know that's Zhang Guangxian? Who is he? He's... You're trying to turn us against each other. Is that really Zhang Guangxian? You've never actually met Zhang Guangxian? No one except him. That is Zhang Guangxian! Do you believe him or me!? It's not important who they believe. The truth is what's important. You wanna die? What the? You're hiding a gun, too? How did his cousin die? Architectual engineer. There was an accident at the job site and he was killed. Xia Zhi wouldn't joke about a dead relative. Maybe he's trying to warn us that he's in trouble. If I don't show up some day, it means they caught me. And his life is in danger. Murderer! He said they were holding the hostage nearby. A kidnapping. Where did they take him? Somewhere nearby. There's an unfinished building down the street. His cousin died on a construction site. So is he trying to tell us that they're at the unfinished building? Before her watch died, it said she was here. That's right. I'm gonna kill him, but let him finish first. You came all the way to Beijing if not to kill someone then it must be for something that Zhang Guangxian had. I told you that Zhuang Guangxian couldn't be trusted, and you still let him pick up the stuff. But he just ran off with it. This stuff it was either very important or very valuable. If it was valuable, who wouldn't want it for themselves? And once someone takes it for themselves, who would want to give it up? There are only two ways someone could take the stuff. First: kill someone and take it. Kill Zhang Guangxian. Dead men tell no tales. Who cares if he's dead? And the stuff? The second way is to share the plunder. Make a deal with Zhang Guangxian. Half and half. I think the priority is to clean up the Zhang Guangxian mess. There' no need to kill an irrelevant person Just find a scapegoat and stuff him in the freezer. Then everything's fine. You tell me which story is airtight? He's lying! You thought it all through. Planned it all out. That is Zhang Guangxian! I didn't take the stuff. Don't you believe me? Do you believe me?! Show us the evidence? I'll show you a bullet! Zhigang. Let's go! Xiao Tian! Come out now! What did you do? I didn't do it on purpose! Open it. Dad! Open it! Don't move! Open it! Don't move. Dad! Don't move! Open it! Daddy. You, come here. Come here and help. Try harder. It won't open. I'm counting to five. If you don't open it, I'll blow her brains out. Don't! Harder. I really can't open it. Try again! Five. Four. Three. Two. One. You are surrounded! Drop your weapon! Release the hostage! Put the gun down. Xiao Tian! Xiao Tian! Get down. Xiao Tian, don't be scared. Daddy's here. Don't be scared. Go! Drop the gun! Young lady, I'm worse than a monster today. Xiao Tian! Don't! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault. I was playing you guys against each other. I called the police, too. My daugter is innocent. Take me instead. When you're done, you can leave. If not, we can die together. We can both die without regrets. Deal. Come here. Go to your mom. Come here. Hurry. Go to mom. Good. Mom! Get me a car! 300,000! It's the middle of the night. How can I get you so much money? My goodness. I didn't see you reload your gun. I reloaded. I reloaded a few days ago. How many bullets did you fire to kill Li Xiping? Two. No. Three. Pow. Pow. Pow. Three shots. Definitely three shots. So what? How many bullets does this gun hold? Six. He shot one bullet in the restaurant. He shot one bullet in the men's room. You used three bullets to kill Li Xiping. You just shot one bullet to turn off the power. Think about it. How many bullets is that? I only used two bullets to kill Li Xiping. People with bad math shouldn't be criminals. I was the only one who witnessed all of these shots. I'm sorry what a shame. You're out. Impossible. Without bullets, I won't run. Mr. Han, don't shoot. Let him try shooting me with his unloaded gun. Come on! Shoot me. Shoot me. Come on! Don't move! Don't move! I'm Xia Zhi. Come. They all confessed. It revealed an international criminal gang. Han Zhigang worked with Interpol to round them all up. In the end, what was the "stuff"? Sit tight, I'll tell you everything. Don't talk bullshit. Tell the truth. To be honest, I don't know. Han Zhigang wouldn't tell me. But I can tell you with certainty, the police have already got their hands on it. If I don't show up next month... To report it. Report what? I'm very close to locating Saddam's treasure. If I'm not already in Iraq, then I'm on my way to Iraq. We. We are on our way to Iraq. Americans don't say, "I alone can fix it." We say, "We'll fix it together!" This is a listed company. All its finances are public. I developed this software myself. It can solve Beijing's traffic problems. Darling, I will love you forever. I don't care about money. All I care about is love. Your food is coming. Excuse me. Mommy is saving all of your New Year's money. When did I ever lie to you? I'm in Hong Kong talking to Andy Lau about a business deal. Sir, you haven't paid yet. Honey, you look skinnier. You look prettier. This is my... godfather. Ah... I got into business school. You'll be able to build a huge network of connections. I can tell you with certainty that the price per square meter will rise to 80,000 next year. Buying this house will be like printing money. Let me tell you. I'm going to launch a luxury car-sharing app. All Lamborghinis. So... Why not launch a plane sharing app? Good idea. Can you loan me some money? I lost my wallet. Do you want a loan? 0% interest. Get cash today. Infertile? We can help. I'm going to start losing weight tomorrow. Honey, I promise this is the last one I'll buy. Okay. I will cut my hands if I go shopping again. Obama is my buddy. He's not in office anymore. He can be a spokesman. No problem. - Really?! - Really. Relax, I can keep a secret. I want to make a lie detection app. When you open the app, it automatically analyzes people's expressions, body language, and tones, and will tell you if they are telling the truth. Perfect for teachers who want to handle students, or wives dealing with their husband. Everything I say is true. Thank you Manager Thank you Segmenters Thank you English Team Thanks for watching
