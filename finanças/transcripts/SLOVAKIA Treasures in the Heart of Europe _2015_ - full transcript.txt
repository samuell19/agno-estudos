These are the high Tatra mountains, the highest peaks of the Carpathian mountain range. They stretch for almost a thousand miles through central Europe and reach their highest elevations here in The Slovak Republic. These rugged peaks are part of the Tatra National Park, one of the many treasures of Slovakia, a country that sits in the geographic center of Europe, but is still largely unknown to the world. rich with history and culture, Slovakia may be the most overlooked, unknown, and untraveled country in Europe. My name is Pat Uskert. I'm a world traveler, with an interest in unknown destinations, and I'm here to explore the heart of Europe. With me is my friend, Mila. A Slovak native, she will make sure we get to all the right places. Together, we are traveling across The Little Big Country. From its capital city on the Danube, into its breathtaking landscape. It is a land of world heritage treasures, medieval towns, castles, lush forests and a people, culture, and history all its own. This is a journey for travelers, and anyone who likes a good adventure. A journey into the heart of Europe into a land of music, dance, castles and mountains. So pack your bags and get ready for adventure. It's time to explore the Little Big Country. This is Slovakia. Bratislava is one hour from Vienna by train, with easy connections to Prague, Hamburg, and Budapest. This is Bratislava's main station. From here, the city is not too far. You can hop on a bus, or walk. On the Danube river, in a passage between the Alps and the Carpathians, Bratislava lies on a historic trade route. Throughout history, this was the gateway to central Europe. In ancient times, Celts and later Romans had settlements here. In the 6th century, migrating Slavic tribes would settle and establish a fortress. A Slavic stronghold would become a city. It would later become the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary. With Vienna and Budapest, it formed a triangle of Austro-Hungarian power. This was a coronation city where kings and emperors were crowned. In German it was called Pressburg. Mozart played his first concert here. Today it is Slovakia's largest city with a population of about half a million. Historically, this is where three worlds came together, Slav, Hungarian and Austrian. With its rich history and complex flavor, it's time to discover Bratislava for ourselves. We are heading to Bratislava Castle. Visible from almost everywhere in the city. Its walls and ramparts are massive. First mentioned in the year 907, it has over a thousand years of stories to tell. Today it is guarded by Svatopluk, last of the old Slav kings. This is one of the best views of the city. The castle restaurant is a great place to take it all in. Massive walls protected the city in medieval times. When the Ottoman Turks invaded Hungary and took Budapest, this became the new capital of the Kingdom. And remained so for some 200 years. This was the coronation church St. Martin's Cathedral. And it still wears the symbolic crown of St. Stephen, made with 18 pounds of real gold. Rulers of the empire were crowned here. Nineteen sovereigns in all. Beethoven's entire Missa Solemnis was premiered here. Inside, a soldier cuts his cloak in two, sharing half with a beggar, the legendary compassion of St. Martin. The old walled city had four gates. This tower is the last remaining gate St. Michael's gate. It is the main entrance to the Old Town. On this first day of Spring, we catch a bit of ceremony and costume. Giving us a glimpse of the city's colorful past and taking us back to when this was the city of kings. In a very Catholic kingdom, the archbishop had a fairly nice residence. This is the Primate's Palace. It is also where Napoleon signed the Treaty of Pressburg ending the Holy Roman Empire. Next to the palace is the Old Town Hall, used since the 15th century, it is one of the oldest stone buildings in Bratislava. The Slovak National Theater is a symbol for the arts. Here you can catch an opera or the national ballet. Hviezdoslav Square is named after Slovakia's greatest poet, a nice place for outdoor restaurants and people watching. This is a good time to brush up on your Slovak. Hello is dobry den. Thank you is dakujem. And beer is pivo, essential vocabulary. Bratislava's Old Town is a special place. Not as large Vienna or Prague, Its smaller streets have their own, cozy charm. And it's easier to see on foot. This is a great place to wander around for a day or two. Whether you like history, food, or just riding around in these city tour wagons. Grassalkovich Palace is where the president resides, Slovakia's White House. This was also the center of Baroque musical life, where Joseph Haydn premiered many of his works. But Old Town is only a small part of Bratislava. There is also a much younger city here. The Corso on the Danube is modern and pretty hip. Complete with bars, cafes, and giant cushions. A good place for taking it easy, and watching the ships go by. It's difficult to ignore the the New Bridge, also known as "The UFO Bridge." The UFO is actually a groovy restaurant and cafe bar. Here you can beam yourself up and abduct some lunch. A few days should be enough to see Bratislava. If you're a history buff or a hopeless romantic, you might need a bit longer. But when you've had your fill, Slovakia has much more to show you. It's time to move on with our adventure. Just upstream from Bratislava, you can walk the paths along the river, and eventually you will arrive at one of the greatest cultural monuments of Slovakia and Slavic history. A fortress of the early Slavs dating back to the 9th century, Devin Castle. It was a major seat of Great Moravia, one of history's first Slavic kingdoms. This is where the Morava River meets the Danube, a position that allowed the control of two major trade routes, the Danube River, and the Amber Road, a trade route that connected the Baltic and Black Seas. This was also a gateway of Christianity. With Byzantine missionaries arriving here in the 9th century. Bringing Christianity and literacy to eastern Europe. If the castle looks a bit rough, it was Napoleon who ordered it ruined during his military campaign in the region. Enduring for over a thousand years, Devin stands like a rugged time capsule, a proud symbol of Slovakia's history. From here we travel down the Danube. The Danube River has played a central role throughout history. As a major trade corridor, and a natural border. It was the frontier of the Roman Empire, and gave rise to empires that followed it. Today it is the most international river in the world, running through 18 countries for about 2,000 miles from Germany to the Black Sea. It runs along the border of Slovakia. Although an international waterway, the Danube is also a river to be enjoyed. Whether cruising on it, playing in it, or just soaking up the sun. The Danube is a source of pleasure, and beauty. And for some people, it's a destination all by itself. The town of Sturovo is the last port before the Danube flows into Hungary. If you're arriving from Budapest, you can enter Slovakia here. Most people visit the Basilica of St. Stephen across the river in Hungary. Sturovo is a small town and a popular summer getaway known for its thermal spas. Hungarian is spoken here, which you'll find in many towns in the south. The two countries share centuries of history, and in some places, it seems they've never separated. Sturovo Station is on a major rail line, with trains to Berlin and Bucharest but we are going deeper into Slovakia. A quick word about getting around in Slovakia. No matter what season you travel, the trains and buses are safe, on time, and will take you to almost anywhere in the country. From big city to tiny village. If you have time, this is a great way to see the country. The train from Bratislava to the Tatra Mountains takes about 5 hours. And the price is reasonable. If you are on a tight schedule, you can of course look into private tour companies. You can also rent a car, Slovakia is relatively small, and you can drive across it in a day. In the warmer months, the country roads are perfect for motorcycling. A great way to experience the magical countryside. As for places to stay, there are lodgings for every taste and budget. From five star resorts, to charming inns. Bed and breakfasts are called penzions, and motels are called "motor rests." No matter how you do it, you will be traveling into a landscape stunning and unspoiled. It has been described as a fairyland. With its forests and mountains, and villages tucked into rolling hills. It is here in its landscape that Slovakia works its magic. With a population of around 5 million, much of the country is country. And then there are the castles. Lots of castles. All together, it is a visual feast. I'm riding north of Sturovo, where the Pannonian Plain meets the Carpathian Foothills. The region is lush and fertile, and full of history. Around the 6th century, Slavic tribes began their great migration and settled the entire eastern half of Europe. Some of the tribes settled here, and eventually formed one of history's first Slavic kingdoms, "Great Moravia." It would leave a legacy that is still with us today. Over a thousand years ago, the city of Nitra was one of its main centers. Today, Nitra is a modern town, known for its universities and its natural setting. But it is mostly known for its historical significance. Nitra is Slovakia's oldest city. Its castle is a blend of centuries of Slovak and Hungarian history. And it stands on much earlier fortresses. Harking back to a time when much of Europe was still pagan, and without a written language. Nitra would come to play an important role as a "Cradle of Christianity." Its first know known ruler was a pagan named Pribina. Who allowed construction of the first known Church among the East and West Slavs opening the doors to Christianity. Two Byzantine missionaries would later make the journey from Greece to Great Moravia, at the request of Moravian Prince Rastislav. These teachers brought enlightenment and Christianity. Today, Greek brothers Cyril and Methodius are honored as "Patron Saints of Europe." The museum houses their legacy. Cyril created the first Slavic writing system based on the Greek alphabet. Called the Glagolitic, it was a precursor to modern day Cyrillic. Working with Methodius, they then translated the bible. Methodius became the first archbishop of Great Moravia, with its main seat in Nitra. Their disciples would travel to other kingdoms, spreading the new knowledge setting the foundations for a Christian eastern Europe. Today they are celebrated in all Slavic countries as "The apostles of the Slavs." This is the legacy of Great Moravia. The young empire eventually became weak and fell to the Hungarians invading from the south. Nitra, became one of the most important cities of the New Kingdom of Hungary. The history of Slavs and Hungarians would intertwine over the next thousand years. In the summer heat, you can find cool shade in the woods. But even deep in the forest, history can be found. This tower was built in the 13th century to protect local gold trade. We are in the Tribec mountain range, not far from Nitra. Hiking among the ruins of a kingdom long past. These ruins were part of a guardian castle system that stretches throughout the region, built in response to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century, they protected the young Kingdom of Hungary. Slovakia has the highest number of castles per capita in the world. Making a kind of paradise for both hikers and history lovers. If you could design a castle from dreams and bedtime stories, it might look something like this. Bojnice is the castle of fairy tales one of the most visited castles in central Europe. This was the home of the wealthy Thurzo and later Palfi families. It was Count Palfi who rebuilt his castle in the romantic style. Blending elements of the French and Tyrolean Gothic, with architecture from the Italian renaissance. Palfi designed and supervised it all himself. Unfortunately he didn't live to see his work completed, dying a bachelor in Vienna, with no heirs. As expected from a fairytale castle, it is rich with lore and legends. The Linden Tree out front is over 700 years old. Providing shade for many a lord and lady The interior is no less spectacular, the Palffy home is now a museum with an astonishing display of his personal treasures, its halls filled with art and exotic luxuries. Tours of the castle last around 75 minutes. The tour ends in dripstone caves beneath the castle. Like any good storybook castle, it must have dark caverns and secret passageways. This is the perfect place to think about the castle's ghost stories such as the Legend of the Black Lady who is sometimes seen on castle grounds. If you consider yourself to be a bit of a ghost hunter, every May the castle hosts "The International Festival of Ghosts and Spirits." With the power dynasties up in their castles, village folks went on about their business. It is in the villages that traditions were passed from generation to generation. Yeah, that's good. Great. We are in in the village of Cicmany. Nestled among forest and hills, it's as quiet and simple as a village can get. Visitors come here for its local charm, and to get a taste of the simple life. Cicmany is known for the unique, ornamental painting of its homes. The designs reflect motifs seen in traditional tapestry and needlework. Each house is a work of art. Although they look like gingerbread houses, Cicmany is a real village. A few penzions in town offer simple, cheap accommodation, and of course food. Quiet and peaceful, you can stay here if you like, and experience the relaxed pace of village life. We've been invited into the workshop of Drahos Dalos a musician, and master craftsman, who will show us the art of making a traditional Slovak flute, the fujara. Originating in the high meadows of the central regions, the fujara was played by shepherds. And its music reflects the sounds of nature that surrounded them. Drahos points out that this is not only an instrument, but a way to talk with nature. According to Drahos, it has a unique resonance, that benefits the mind and soothes the soul. The fujara has been added to the United Nations World Heritage list of humanity's masterpieces. From shepherds in the highlands, a gift to the world. In the center of Europe, many sounds and have come together to create a wealth of music, song, and dance. And this is a country that loves to dance and drink. Festivals throughout the summer are a good place to have a listen. This is in the village of Hrusov. Once a year, this sleepy hamlet becomes a celebration of music, food, and life itself. This is music from the heart of Europe. While traveling across the country, we made sure to catch a few castle festivals, with each castle celebrating its own place in Slovak history and culture. At Orava Castle, we enjoyed a ghoulish night tour. This by the way, is the where the first vampire movie was made. Nosferatu, in 1922. The castle is said to be quite haunted. And its most famous ghost is called "The White Lady." The day ends with a night market. and a dazzling fireshow Some of the festivals last for days. Like this one in Trencin. Celebrating its stunning fortress, and colorful past. From Roman legions fighting barbarians. And Ottoman Turks at its gates. And the tournament was amazing. I am walking along the Dunajec river, on a path that has been used for thousands of years. In ancient times, boats were the main form of transportation and Greeks and Romans used these rivers particularly in the trade of amber. This route was part of the Amber Road. A long trade route from northern seas to the Mediterranean. Rafting continued as a form of transportation throughout the centuries and much like truckers of today, rafters hauled a lot of goods from lumber and iron, to cheese and medicinal herbs. Today, you can join rafters in their ancient and proud traditions. Like the seashells worn on their hats. Each seashell meant a successful journey to the sea and back. And a rafter with many seashells was a seasoned veteran. Eventually this river flows into Poland, and then to the Baltic Sea, but we are getting off at the border. After rafting, we stop for lunch at the old monastery on the river. This is Cerveny Klastor, the red monastery. This was a real medieval monastery. Here you can sit near a crackling fire, enjoy a frothy ale and a hearty meal. In Slovak, bon appetit is "dobru chut." We are making are our way into Eastern Slovakia. In a region called SubCarpathian Ruthenia, home of Slovakia's Rusyn population. Their roots go back to Kievan Russia. The region is famous for its wooden churches most built around the 17th century. Each church is a masterpiece of Rusyn architecture. Each is unique. They are fitted together without the use of nails. And many using woods that contain natural termite repellants. The builders were masters of woodwork. Hundreds of years old, these churches of wood were designed to endure for centuries. In this part of Europe, eastern and western Christianity meet. With catholic churches just down the road from Eastern Orthodox. Inside we find biblical scenes painted long ago. The walls are rich with religious imagery. With local artists creating their own Sistine chapel. The creativity of Rusyns doesn't stop with wooden churches. Here in the town of Medzilaborce you can visit the Andy Warhol Museum. It is the second largest collection of his work outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Andy Warhol was born Andrej Varhola to Carpatho-Rusyn parents who emigrated to the United States from here. Andy Warhol's pop art set off a chain reaction that completely changed the world of art and music, influencing generations of artists around the world. He may be the most well known artist of the twentieth century. Today, the region celebrates his legacy. For die-hard fans of his work, this is a necessary pilgrimage. Bardejov, is an almost perfectly preserved medieval town. Its walls, and burger houses are all as they were centuries ago. Most people know Bardejov from its picturesque old town square, long ago one of the biggest marketplaces of central Europe. With Bardejov located on the road between the Baltic and Black Seas, it was a major center of trade in the middle ages. It enjoyed the privileges of a royal city, with its merchants free to travel throughout the kingdom. Today we can only imagine its medieval market, bustling with merchants and goods from far away. Its production of linens and cloth was unsurpassed, and it had more than 50 guilds from blacksmiths, locksmiths, cobblers, furriers, all doing brisk business. Bardejov feels frozen in time. If you've come this far, make sure to climb the bell tower. The climb pays off with a view fitting of a postcard. Actually this view is on every Bardejov postcard, but much better to see it in person. The Gothic cathedral of St. Aegidius dominates the square. Built in the 13th century, it houses some of the finest wood-work in the country. If you like walking into history, but don't have a time machine, visiting Bardejov might be the next best thing. On its rocky perch, overlooking the surrounding countryside, is one of the largest and most astonishing castles in central Europe, Spis Castle. It is a precious cultural monument of the Spis region and a world heritage treasure. Spis castle attracts over 100,000 visitors a year. With construction started in the 12th century, it became the major center of power in the region. It was one of the few castles to resist the Mongol attacks of 1241. With its steep approach, multiple gates and numerous walls, its defenses were almost unbeatable. Outside the castle, stone columns were part of the first defense line. Invaders breaching the first wall, would find more walls on the other side. If anyone managed to break through the first gate, there was a second gate, and then a third. Defenders could always fall back having the advantage of the high ground. Attackers would find themselves trapped in the courtyard where they were easy targets. A brilliant design. The kitchen is nicely restored. The prison and torture room has a few interesting items. From the hanging cage, to the rack, and other various instruments. If you happen to be wearing your battle armor, you may find it difficult to climb the narrow passages of the tower. Of course, that was precisely the idea of the design. A group of attackers would be forced into a single file line, making them much easier to handle one at a time. From the top of the tower, we can see all the way to the Tatra mountains. I found this to be one of those unforgettable travel moments. The view, and the feeling of being at the top of this medieval fortress, it is breathtaking. Villages spread before you, and the wind is in your hair. And for a moment, you have a glimpse of what it was like to be the king. Much of the country is covered in wild forestland making it a great escape for outdoor lovers. Mila and I are on our way to the Slovensky Raj National Park. At the entrance booth, you can actually buy two tickets to paradise. Slovenky Raj means Slovak Paradise. Here you'll find and scenery that is fitting of its name. A great escape into nature if you need a break from sight-seeing. We are on one of the more popular trails known for its ladders and waterfalls. It's important to start early, because it's a challenging trail, and will take some time. This is a long day of ladders, iron chains, and steps as we work our way through gorges and waterfalls. If you're serious about hiking and trekking the country has an extensive trail network making it possible to travel across the entire country by foot. At the halfway point, there is a restaurant and lodge. If it's too late in the day, you can spend the night. If you are a big fan of subterranean adventures, Slovakia is somewhat of a caver's dream come true. With a remarkable number of caves for a country of its size. Beneath its rugged landscape are several thousand caves. With new caves still being discovered, and many not fully explored. Some of the cave systems go on for miles. Forty-four caves are national treasures and 12 are open to the public. Each cave offers a different experience, If you have a thing for aragonite, there are only three known aragonite caves in the world, and one of them is here. In the Ochtinska Aragonite Cave, you can marvel at this rare mineral and its starlike formations. In the cave's Milky Way Hall, aragonite clusters in the ceiling shine like stars across the sky. Each cave is a precious one-of-a-kind diamond, the result of just the right conditions. and eons of time. But caves are not the only underground adventure to be had. In the hills of a collapsed volcano, in a region rich with gold and silver, we are in the mining town of Banska Stiavnica. Centuries ago, this was the most important mining town of the Habsburg Empire. It was the world center of mining innovation. The mines are now museums. Here you can gear up, and take a guided tour and descend into mining history. We are going into the mines, very exciting. These mines were the main source of gold and silver in the Kingdom of Hungary. At one time producing 40% of Europe's gold. Digging deeper each century called for new technology. Flooded mines gave rise to the first piston pumps. In 1627, gunpowder blasting was used here for the first time in the world. Mining became a science and the first Mining Academy was created, the first technical school in the world. Outside, a new system of artificial lakes was designed to create power for machinery. The new techniques would spread throughout the world. Although its mining days are in the past, Banska Stiavnica is today one of Europe's great treasures. A United Nations world heritage site, it is an important stop on our Slovakia adventure. Slovakia is a land of four seasons, each with its own beauty and color. But there are certain pleasures that only winter can bring, like fairy-tale landscapes and snowcapped mountains, and skiing of course, and a few more I'd like to mention, like ice hockey. For a country of its size, it is a formidable player on the world stage. Some of the biggest names in the NHL are Slovak. Like Hall of Famers Stan Mikita and Peter Stastny. Soaking in thermal spas is a normal part of life here. The spas or kupalisko are fed by natural thermal springs. Rich in salts and minerals they are good therapy for just about any ailment you can think of. There's something about a frosty evening in an old European town that just appeals to my sense of romance. Kosice is Slovakia's second largest city, it has the feel of a little Vienna. It is a treasure of architecture and history. Its cathedral is the easternmost Gothic cathedral in Europe. This was one of the first towns in Europe to have its own coat of arms, granted in the 14th century. A village in winter can also be an experience. Especially if you catch some winter festivities. These noisy people coming down the street are celebrating the coming of Lent. This is a last chance to drink and feast before the fasting begins. And these revelers are making sure to have their fill. Much like Halloween in the USA, people go door to door with their masks and costumes. But instead of candy, here you get wine and shots of hard spirits. Kind of like Trick or Treat for adults. Inside the local town hall, celebrations go on into the night. We can't leave the village without a traditional meal. Mila has invited me to dinner to sample a traditional dish. Yes, so, now we are going to make bryndzove halusky. Bryndzove Halusky about as Slovak as you can get. So, the secret is to make your own homemade pasta. A little bit of bacon. Halusky is a type of pasta, like gnocchi. And bryndza is a zesty sheep cheese. Usually topped with a type of bacon, it is a simple farmers meal, that will give you enough power to climb the high Tatras, exactly where we are going next. Our next destination, the city of Poprad, the gateway to the Tatra Mountains. It is the largest city of the Spis Region, and a bustling holiday resort town. The town center has Polish and German influences, and boasts a church and bell tower from the 13th century. The original center of Poprad was a German Colony called Deutschendorf, or German town. Today it is a romantic getaway, the old burger houses are now inns and taverns. And spectacular views of the mountains are never far off. Although beautiful from a distance, we want to see them up close. Getting to the mountains is easy enough with the Tatra mountain railroad. This light rail takes you to the mountain villages and ski resorts. The Tatra Mountains are one of central Europe's premiere winter playgrounds. Yeah, we're getting off. Getting closer to the mountains. Back in town, Mila and I are looking for lunch. When this outspoken restaurant owner gets our attention. Our new friend cooks up a heavenly Segendinsky Gulas, stewed pork with sauerkraut in a tangy sauce, served with steamed dumplings on the side. And a hot bowl of kapustnica, a hardy cabbage soup. In this winter cold, it hits the spot. Properly fed, Mila and I head into the hills to enjoy some trails. I want to see as much of the Tatra Mountains as possible. We are trekking in an area called Popradske Pleso, surrounded by mountains and a peaceful quietness. The Tatra Mountains are not only a playground, but the spiritual center of this nation. They are mentioned in legends and songs, and even in the country's national anthem. With its long history of turbulence and invasions, the mountainous landscape of Slovakia provided natural borders and pockets of refuge throughout its history. They are an integral part of the country's identity. In this symbolic cemetery, the crosses are symbolic gravestones of those that have lost their lives in the mountains, skiers, mountaineers, or simply those whose hearts will always be here. There is a gondola that will take you to the top, which is exactly where we want to go. It's not a trip for the faint of heart, however, or for those who simply don't like being in a box hanging from a cable. We're on our way to the top of Lomnitsky Stit, the second highest peak in the High Tatras. The highest peak we can reach without having to climb. The Tatras are not as high as the alps, nor the Himalaya, but they have their own rugged beauty, unique to them. Whether you climb, or take the elevator, the view at the top is worth the trip. Here you can stand above the clouds, among alpine peaks, at the very top of a mountain. I would say this place at the top of Slovakia is a good place to pause and reflect on our Slovak adventure. It is a little country, but it's also a big country. I hope you've enjoyed exploring Slovakia with us, and that the place that was once so unknown, now feels a little more familiar. From the High Tatras in Slovakia, in the heart of Europe, we say thank you, and see you again. Dakujem a dovidenia.
