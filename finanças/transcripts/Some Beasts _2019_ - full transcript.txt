Mom, come. I'll show you your room. Let's go. Look how nice it is. This room is cold. Yes, it's because we just arrived. We'll turn on the heaters and it will warm up quickly. Now, I'll make lunch. I'm cooking Curanto. I'll get everything ready. It'll be delicious. - Do you live here? - What? Do you live here? I work as a caretaker. Sometimes I stay here, but my family is in Calbuco. My wife and daughter live there. So, you stay sometimes? Yes, I'll stay as long as you are here. Whatever you need, let me know. - Nicols? - Nicols, yes. Excuse me. I'll make lunch. Why don't you go and learn how to prepare Curanto? - Go watch, son. - Leave me alone, Dad. Go, so Nicols can teach you. You can learn something about this area. Don't stay inside. Take a stroll, get to know the island. Ok, let's go and see how to cook a Curanto. - May I help you? - You drank my tea. No, this is your tea. No, I'm making one for you. I was putting some sugar in it. Two spoons as usual? - Don't use sugar. - I don't use sugar. Maxi, take care of your sister. Honey, go with your brother. Have a cracker with the tea. Can I put some cheese on it? Yes, with cheese. Be careful, Consu. Don't go to... Relax. Nicols will watch them. Tea alone gives you heartburn. This is the house, sir. What do you think? He is peeing out there. In front of his sister, that brat. Hey! - Hey! - Leave it, sir. - Sir, leave it. - Yeah, Dad. No! Such bad manners! He is peeing in front of her. Bratty brat. - But Dad! - No, they are old enough... That's the way kids are nowadays, sir. You've never peed on a tree? That's right, blow. Harder! There's nothing better than peeing on a tree. The bigger stones over here... Come to learn. The fire is ready. Once the stones heat up, we add the seafood, and then the meat. I'll blow some more. The firewood, please? Careful, Consu. Don't worry. - More water? - Consuelo is skinny. I don't think so. She does lots of sports at school. She's got your slim build. - You've always been slim. - Yes, well, and my Dad, and my Mum too. I was... That cat is here again. Don't be stubborn, come. Come here. Stay with me. What's wrong? - What is it? - No, give her to me. - Will you take her out? - Dad's allergic. - Are you allergic to cats? - Yes. - Since when? - Since always. Your friends know you're coming? Just Vale. I don't like the others. So quiet! Such tranquility! What a wonderful place. It's ours. - Shall we go back? - It's a bit far. Shall we go for lunch? - Does the cat bother you? - No. - Don't put it here. - Can I help you? Yeah, it looks like it. Here are some more oysters. Maxi, come here! I've eaten so much... Hurry up. - More oysters? - Ok. I'll put some on your plate. This shit is broken. I thought it was me who had no strength. Nothing wrong with you, just this... - You're pretty fine. - What are they up to? I don't know... Ana is coming. - I'll take these... - Yes. - Do you want some lemon? - Sure. - Pass me the plate. - Which one? - Take it to the kitchen. - What else? - Open this bottle. - Sure, let me. - There you go. - Thank you. Where's your glass? I'll pour it. It's that one, but bring me a new one. Take these bottles to the kitchen. - Pour it. - Yes, give it to me. - This one? - No, that one over there. - This one? - Yes. - Where are you going? - The woods. - Where? - The woods. - With whom? - Maxi. And my permission? Can I go, Dad? Ok, but no tree climbing. Mximo, go with her. I want to see a big smile on your face. Take care, my love. Excuse me. Keep out of the woods. What's going on? I'm just telling them to stay close... - Take care of your sister. - Yes, Dad. I mean it. Like it? It feels weird while I'm eating. I'd like to eat first. Yes, my love, come with me. Pass it to me! Pass it to me. Careful. Maxi, it hurts. Cut it out, cut it out. It hurts. It hurts! It hurts me, you asshole! Cut it out. Now, give me a kiss! - A little kiss! - Stop! Maxi, it hurts... Cut it out! Asshole, cut it out! I won, it's mine! Hey, pass it to me. Pass it to me! May I push you, Miss? - Uh? - Should I push you? Okay. Consu! You tell me how hard, ok? Harder? - A bit harder. - That's it! 30 minutes walking. - Can you accompany me? - Of course. I'll go with you. Do you like this tree? - This one? - Yes. - Yes. - This is a pine tree. At the top, if you climb up you can see the whole island. How? You can go up? Yes. See that rope there? Grab it and go up like a ladder. There's a lookout. - Really? - You can sit there. Do you dare? Yes, of course. And could you come up with me? Sure, you can't go alone. Ask your parents first. - It's a bit dangerous. - Yes. Ok. Easy. - Slower? - Yes. There. - Hey, asshole! - What happened? What's wrong with you? You touched my ass. - Of course not. - You did, asshole. It was unintentional. You touched me. I didn't. My daughter is your age. Asshole. - Hey... - Fucking asshole. Hey! At least eight million pesos. Yes, but there are funds. What happened? Nothing. - Is everything ok? - Yes. As Alejandro told you. There are regional funds. The idea is to boost tourism in the Calbuco region. - Eco-tourism. - Did you apply? - Yes. - And you didn't win? We're waiting for the results. They are in the evaluation phase. And how much did you ask for? We requested money for infrastructure renovation. Yes. But even if we get the grant, we'll still need more funding. An important part. And I was thinking... But do you need some capital to apply? - No. - No, it's not necessary. No, they give you the initial capital. Our capital is the land. Yes, that is a plus, since when we applied for the grant, we could include this considerable asset. The contribution is the island. That cat again. Well? Where does the big one come from? The great idea? No, I mean the big money. What are you going to do? Frankly, you need to do a lot of work, change the electrical system, and there's the water issue... There's no water. No, there is a part... You must solve the water supply. In summertime it can get complicated. You're right. We're working to improve services. - Sure... - We're working hard. I'm asking you, why would you come to an island that has difficult access, instead of staying in a hotel? - Where are you going? - Looking for Maxi. - Ok, be careful. - Honey, please close the door. Continue, sorry... What was I saying? Why would you come to an island, with complicated access, a place where there is nothing to see but nature, nothing to do and no Wifi connection? That's the greatest virtue of the island, its particularity, and what is sought more and more. - Ok. - It's a new notion of luxury, it's different from what a resort or tourism chain has to offer. It's something different. Look, ma'am. Sorry to interrupt, people are looking for native, primitive nature. Enough talking. We get it. Where does the capital come from? Yes Dad, I'm getting there... The big investment we agree you need. Tell her, it's your Mom. Do I tell her? Do you? - Do I? - Mom... Yes? We wanted to ask you, actually, to propose you to be part... Invite you. Me? That's why we told you about the advantages of this place, because what we want... is for you to help us. Exactly. Help us with this project, I know you own a vast land area in Algarrobo... Vast... and with only a part of that we could finance the gap left after the grant and our savings investment. Grandma will say yes. No, no fucking way. Look at this place. She can't say no. No way, Grandma is petty. Grandpa... He gives. You cracked your lip. It's bleeding. Will Grandpa say yes? Yeah, Grandpa might. No, Grandma will. She's not stupid. Ah, my chest hurts. Does it hurt? You asshole, my breast. Still... A hotel? Dad's crazy. Ok, it can be a good business. We don't understand much about hotels. That's not our line of business. As a family, we bought land. But not all land can be sold. I believe you can understand that, not all land can be sold. Mom, I don't mean all... I'm not selling any land, Ana. Mom, I know. That's not what we propose. We invite you join us in a project far more profitable than renting out your lands in Algarrobo. Hey... Did you lure us here to get us involved in this project? No. Don't misunderstand us. It's an invitation, Dad. It was an invitation to spend a quiet weekend. Not to be asked for money. Well, think about it. You don't need to answer now. - Yes, it's not that. - Ok. It's not the idea, if you won't help, be part of it. Stop. Helping has affective overtones. If you don't want to help your family, your daughter, your grandchildren, - Don't fuck. - With some money. - No, don't fuck. - Give us a push. - Alejandro. - No, don't fuck with us... You're taking it to a level that is irrelevant. - Understand? - What? You're manipulating us, forget it. - Guys. - Don't. The lunch was great, the wine is still good. I would end this here. - Me too. - Ok? - Asshole, don't hit me so hard! - That's what the game is about. Ok. Go, go. Sorry, sorry. It does not hurt me. Fuck! Asshole. Asshole, it really hurt. Look! - Fuck! - Ok, last one. Ok. - The winner takes it all. - Ok. I won. I won! Calm down. We'll see what we can do, ok? Maybe if we put everything under your name. With that condition maybe your Mom... could do it. Everything under your name, ok? - For me is the same. - No, it doesn't for me. With this imbecile it doesn't. And under the kids' names? They are minors, love, you can't. Under your name. Let's leave him out. You already told me. You're not happy with that imbecile. Let's leave him out, listen to me. It will be under your name. It hasn't rained. But there's a reserve water tank. Yes, but it hasn't rained. - How long will our reserve last? - A day and a half. It's ok, we'll leave tomorrow. Yes, but you don't understand. The house is crowded, so you need to save water. Don't flush the toilets that much... Ideally, don't shower... Until it rains. I need to fix the roof. It is leaking. - But listen. - And the pipes? I'll fix it tomorrow, relax. Yes, I'm relaxed. Now listen to me. It's very important that this conversation stays between us. Got it? This island doesn't need power, nor water, nor signal... - Let me go! - Stay still! Let me go, you asshole. Asshole, you idiot. You're an asshole, Maxi. - What's wrong? - You bit me, asshole. I was just playing. Sorry... Asshole. You stained your pants. Asshole, you stained my pants, come on. - Sorry. - These pants are expensive. Hurry up! I'm all dirty. Will this grime come out? Yes. Take off your pants. Nicols cleans them, issue solved. - Help me here. - Yes. No problem. - Do you sleep here? - Yes. Yes, I sleep here. - It's my shelter. - It's nice here. - Yes, it's warmer. - Yes. I play guitar and do things. Isn't it weird to sleep here? No, no, no. No, I have my house there in... - Calbuco. - I stink of shit. Will you leave your pants? Yes, well, I'm going to change and... Yes, you can wash them with... sea water. You just scrub them. It troubles me that I'll leave stinking shit all over. No, it's no big deal. - That's nothing! - You wash them then? Sure, if you need to... - I'll wash them. - Thank you. Ok, I'll come immediately. Fuck. I'll put these cups in the kitchen and I'm ready. Ok, I'll wait for you. Grandma. Are you ready yet? What's the name of that guy who's helping you? - Excuse me? - Your caretaker. Nicols. Nicols could be a... - A what? - Like a tourist guide here. Nicols takes care of everything. Whenever he's alone and tourists arrive, he's in charge. This place is very pretty. Nicols knows a lot about this place. He grew up here, is the only one who knows every corner of the island. Have you always drunk Yerba Mate? No. It's been like two years now. - Yes. - Since he went to Mendoza. What? Since he went to Mendoza. - Do you want some? - Let me try it. It has a bit of sugar. It's really nice, Mom. Alejandro makes it with some spices... - I add mint, ginger. - Do you stir it? No, just drink it like that. I like that. As more foreigners arrive, they drink more Yerba Mate. Not only Argentines or Uruguayans drink it. Of course not. Will you try it, Antonio? - No, thanks. - No? Watch your blood pressure! Watch your drinking! I want to pee. No, honey, be careful! - Hey. - Damn, she's going to break... - It's not a good idea. - Get down. - Stop, now. - Sir. - What? - Look, come here. Ma'am, I want to take you somewhere. - Come. Honey, you too. - Yes, I see. This is the island's magical spot. My son... It's so lovely here. You don't have to go abroad to study or anything. We'll miss you. Mom, we've already talked about this. I didn't want to bring up the subject again. But I have a strange feeling about your trip. Look, in Chile you can develop your career too. You don't have to go so far to do that. Ok, enough. Show me. Do you want more water? - You look... - What? - You look fat. - No. It's just a photo. Someone is missing. - Who is not in the photo? - A nigger. Ok, enough, delete it. - I'm shocked. - Delete it. Good thing he smiled, at least you can see his teeth. Or he's lost in black shadow. - I'm kidding. - Yes, I know. Don't get mad. I'm kidding. I know you're joking. You'll have a session, Dad. - A session? - A photo-shoot. Photos? - You have no signal? - No. - What's that for? - To upload the picture. Ok, but you can upload it later. Later where? There is no signal. It's supposed to be a signal here. I mean later, in Santiago. You upload them right away. Instagram means instant. Why don't you learn from your sister? She hasn't used her phone since we arrived. Because she's smart. She doesn't need to. Beautiful. This sunset is stunning. - It's perfect. - Look at the water. It's so calm at this time of day. Do you want one? Look how beautiful the moon is. - It's half full. - Yes. Ana. - Some wine? - Yes. Thanks. Here. Thank you. Cheers. Wine? - No, thanks. - Don't. - Thank you. - What? Just have one glass. I don't drink anymore, thank you. Marshmallow? Sure, a marshmallow. Thank you. This guy, what's his name? Nicols, do you like some wine? - What? - Do you want some wine? Sure. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Cheers. - Pass me a glass. - Delicious. Say a few words. Thank you for the food. It's all been lovely, the food was delicious, exquisite. This beautiful night... - What else do we need? - A toast to music. To the music. Thank you for your help. To my in-laws! Thank you for coming. It's a nice place. Congratulations! Thank you, Mom. Cheers. May I help you? You scared me. What happened? What's this? My Mom gave it to me. Shut up. No, no. You want it too. Calm down! You misunderstood, ma'am. Shut up. - Shut up. - What are you doing? Shut up. - No, I don't want to. - Shut up. Please stop, ma'am. Please stop. Relax, ok? Relax. Relax. Please. Relax. Don't you want to relax? Please stop. Okay, okay, not today. Another day. Another day, okay? Gorgeous. We'll be overrun with blacks. Do you think so? - Well... - Aren't there bigger logs? That contributes to diversity in a certain way. What do you mean diversity? Excuse me. I'm going to bed. Good night. But it's so early. Pass me the guitar, please. Go to bed, Nicols, you've worked all day. Ok. Ok, thank you very much. - Thank you. - See you tomorrow. Good night. Smoke is coming out. I'm going to move the logs. He's like a slave-boy. He works reluctantly. No, he's tired. He worked all day. Tired of what? It's his job. You pay him, right? - What? - You pay him, right? Yes, I do. But he is human. He has to rest. Niggers do the same thing. Don't put so many logs. We're not staying much longer. - That's enough. - Ok. Sorry. We could put the hall there. The hall that would be close to the check-in. The check-in should be in the hall. - We continue. - We knock it down there. - Ok. - This other wall... we leave it as it is because it has a nice window. People would enter there. The check-in, all open to the outside. - And there? - A painting. What can the painting be? Of what? Imagine it... What painting would you put there? For now let's stick to the structural issue and then get into the details. Then we will find the suitable painting. - Ok, right. - Right? So, we knock down the wall. What about the ladder? We need one. I'd restore the old one. It's very cute. I'd leave the staircase because up there would be... three bedrooms. What's with the window? - It's the wind. - It's blowing hard. Yes. A little for your mouth? - It's disgusting. - It's good. - No. - Your lips can crack. Put some on. Come on. I don't want to. There. Disgusting. It's not! It's good for you. - The wind... - It doesn't dry out. I'll use some on my nose, so it doesn't crack from blowing it too much. One of my friends, got some here. Two shots like this, stretched... Like this... See? You want to get that done? I don't know. I don't like needles. Forget it. They say it makes you look 10 years younger. And if you feel younger... Damn it! There's no signal. That's not a good angle... You're disgusting! Stop. Enough. Ok, you now. - No, I'm embarrassed. - Just one. But I don't know how. Ok, stand up... Be more sexy... One more time. Nicols, it's 8:30, man. Nicols, I need... Dad! What's wrong? - Daddy. - What? - There's no water. - What? - No. - Does the tap work? - Both of them? - Nothing. Use the glass of water in my room. Where's the water? At least say hello. Good morning. Good morning. How did you sleep? Fine. There's no water. - Really? - Really. Nicols! Nicols! What happened, dear? - I don't know. What happened? - Did Nicols leave? No, he didn't go away. - The boat's missing. - Did he leave? No. He didn't leave. Ana! Ana, he must be... Ana, listen. - My love, stop. - Leave me alone. Don't make a fuss. Consuelo, go out. I have to talk to your Mom. I have to talk to her! You'd better go to your room. - Honey. - Stop. Please, calm down. Mximo. -What? - Get water. -Dad... - I said get water! -I'm busy. - You're not busy! You're not doing anything! Let's go! -Now! - Coming! -Careful, daughter, don't get wet. - Ok. Take this. Here... Come on. Don't just stand there. Come help, I mean it. You're already done. -What! - You're finished. No, we have to move them. Stop making a fuss! Don't be difficult! Mximo, help your sister. Come on! Your brother will take that. I'm not going to tell you everything you have to do. -You okay, honey? - Yes. Come on, Mximo. -Your Grandma is waiting. - Let's go. The girl has no willpower. She was like that as a child. No will, at all. Don't look. Everything is fine... He's convinced her. - Of course... - That's it. It's going to rain... It's horrible. - Horrible. - So cold. - Are you warm enough? - Yes. Close this up a bit. All of this makes me sick. This grimy house. Just look at this dirt. It's falling to pieces. Yes. It's a disaster. Look, I don't want to bother you anymore. Ok? I know you don't trust me. Fair enough. Just give me a chance. Sell that land. In a few years it will be worth nothing. They're building condos next to it. I'm asking for a loan. It's not for me, but your grandchildren, my children, and your daughter. I told you we weren't ready to bring people here yet. Now my parents are going to start complaining... They can't shower. Nicols must've gone to the mainland. - Didn't I tell you? - Hon, you must trust me. He's disappeared. Don't worry. He'll show up. Four sixes. You have to bet higher than me. - More than you? - More than me. - How much did you say? - I said four sixes. Four sixes... I pass. - You can't pass. - Why not? You have to bet. I can't... I don't have shit. I have everything different, look. No, but you have sixes. - Two sixes. - One. Two, and I said four. You bet immediately two more. - Sure... - Now, concentrate. Two sixes and you said four sixes. I said four because I know I have three... So you must have one. - Or a joker. - You're lying. I'm guessing. I think it is this way. Do you understand? I lie. But by deduction, I know it must be something like that. - See? - You're good. At bluffing. Now. No, but... What happened, dear? - What is it? - He isn't here. What happened? You're freezing to death. There, there. Calm down, Ana. But... He must be out there, love. Nothing happened. I have faith in them. - You mean the kids? - Yes. Maxi must study abroad. They should stay more with us. Consuelo should stay more at our house. With us. Move her away a little. The rest is mediocrity. Ok? Pure mediocrity. - If you say so. - It's all mediocrity. Well, if you say so... - Aren't you cold? - No. - Are you? - No, I'm ok. Close your jacket. And your scarf? I left it. I'm not letting you go. - No! - Calm down. - I'm calm. Please! - You're upset. - Let me go. - I'm not letting you go. - Enough already. - Ana, Ana... I don't want to. - Honey... - Let me go. I'm not letting you go. Stay with me. Don't squeeze me like that! - Then, listen to me! - No! Don't go. She breaks my heart. She really breaks my heart. It's clear... One needs to be with somebody who gives you something in life. Ah? It's a question... of class, of benefits, I don't know... Ana never understood that. Do you remember his family and cousins at that horrible wedding? I was furious. That wedding was a nightmare. A disaster. What honey? What do you need? What is it? Go see Consuelo. - See if she's in her room. - Ok. I heard her get up. I'm worried. She's in a fragile state. Thanks. I'll wait for you. Consu. Are you sleeping, love? Are you tired? Grandpa, I'm sleeping. Yes, pretty. I came to say good night. Love you very much. Sir. Is Consuelo ok? No, I was just saying good night. - Is she okay? - Everything's fine. Good night. - Dad... - Uh? Stroke my hair. Okay, my love. I love you, good night. Stop criticizing me! - What did I tell you? - I'll solve this. Until there isn't a fucking problem left. - Calm down. - I am calm! Just fucking listen to me for once! And trust me. I'll fix this. I'll get us off this island. I'll fix the water. Nicols will come back. Don't shout at her! I'm not! I'm talking! - You're shouting. - I'm not. - Leave her alone. - Look at her. Look at me! She's like that because you started shouting and fighting. - I don't want to fight. - Where is Nicols? I don't want to fight with you Mximo. Everything will be ok. Calm down, ok? I'm sick of this, Mum. Let's go back to Santiago. - Yes, we're going to go. - Now. Yes, love. Soon... When Nicols comes back. And when is he coming back? Soon... We don't know when. But... How can you not know? We don't know exactly. He left. But he'll be back. His things are here. He's the caretaker. He'll come back to his job. Not everything is about money. Easy for you to say. Important things have nothing to do with money. Sure, it's easy for you. - Do you think it's easy for me? - You chose this life. Maxi, listen to me. - Get dressed and help me. - I don't want to! Your grandmother is complaining. Stop crying and be a man. Get dressed and help me. Yeah, sure. I'm giving you an order. Get dressed! - Alejandro, calm down. - Mximo, come on! - Listen to your Dad. - Let go of me. Honey, be careful. I'm fine. This wood is rotten. - Are you ok? - Yes. Help me, your Grandmother is complaining. Alejandro sit down. I can't, my love. Your parents are complaining. Get up. Get dressed and help me. It's an order. Let me see your foot. Be careful... His foot is full of splinters! Go and see your Dad. Help your Dad, love. Go. Mximo, get inside. I'm talking to you. I'm your Dad. I said get inside. Mximo! -Inside, goddamnit. - Let me go, asshole! Enter now, I told you, goddamnit. Come to help me. Let him go! Leave me alone, for God's sake! I don't know why we came here. Mum, what's the big deal? It's no more than 20 million, 10 million, whatever you can. That man, has only made you suffer. I'm not going to help a bum like Alejandro. Besides, it's my land. My Mum and Dad left it to me. It's your land, Mum, yet in a way it's mine too, no? When I die. Or do you want me to die now? Fuck, I'm just like Dad. Want to smoke a joint? Ok. Let's go. Don't cry. Don't cry anymore. You always fall for the same trap. Ana, I'm starting to doubt your common sense, your capacity to understand situations and analyze them. You brought us here. Look at this disaster. What a disaster these past three days have been. That guy went away and left us trapped here. Are you smoking it by yourself? No. Ok, wait. I hope it doesn't hurt. Breath in slowly. Very good! Let's go. No, it scares me. Why? Because you can't see anything. - Look. - Yeah. I saw you. Mum. Yes? With the weather like this, maybe we can play Dixit. - What? - What's Dixit? A board game. Shall we? Dixit. I'll wear warmer clothes. It's cold. Yes, wrap up. It's cold here. Downstairs is warmer. I'll still wrap up. It's so cold. I understand. I'm not upset. It's just a game, Maxi. You're going either way. Don't worry. - I'll win. - No, he won't. You're not going anywhere. - What do you mean? - He's not going, if... He's already there. He's gone. Whatever. Dad, why don't we play Dixit? To Maxi's trip. Cheers, cheers. You can't make a toast. To the trip. No, stop, Maxi. - No, no, I won't let you leave. - Ok, Maxi. - What? - Put the glass down. - First the joint. - We are family. I'm your Dad. - Another round. - Like it or not. Another round. Sit over there so I can deal. - I'm fine here. - Please! So I can deal the cards. Or we stop playing. There. - There. - Charming. Calm down. We'll use a timer to pick cards. It's taking too long. - It's a stopwatch? - Maybe. - Lady Dolores is slow. - I'm dealing them quickly. - Grandpa gave it to me. - It's a stopwatch? - Of course. - Put it on then. Ok. - There. - Can we look? Yes. No, I'm still dealing. Ok, now you can start. One, two, three. Grandma, your turn. - Mine? - Yes. Ok... Gabriela Mistral. Ready. Chilean poet. Ready? Gabriela Mistral, from head to toe. Fuck, it's cold. Mum... Mum, the card. - Has everybody played? - Pass the cards. - Did you put one down? - Yes, yes. Should I shuffle? Or does Antonio shuffle? - You, Grandma. - Ok. Oh, it was Grandpa's turn. It doesn't matter. So, these are the cards. Attention, attention, attention. What's the matter? The card you chose... What was it again? Gabriela Mistral. - Why? - Some cows... It's upside down. Turn it around. You can't touch them. Don't touch the cards. - I know you, Mum. - Do we say which one? I know what you chose. What? - What? - Grandpa, pick one. Me? This one. Easy... Or not? I told you. From head to toe. - Consu, no. - The queen. - Well done. - It's similar. Not even close. Maxi, your hand. Ok then, Mum. It's metaphorical. - Your turn, Dad. - That one. The most boring one. Your choice? This one, of course. That's the one... Grandma, which one was it? Well, it was that one. Nobody picked the right one. - I won. - Me too. - I won too. - Three. - I won. - You're lying. I won. What rabbit do I have to move? - The red one? - Me, move mine. And mine? Move my horse. I mean, my rabbit. - You shuffle. - My horse! - My horse, my horse. - Move my horse. - Consu, three. - Yes. Galloping away. That guy left for good? - Dad, stop. - Is he coming back? Nicols? Yes, sir. He's coming back. But not tonight? - What are you doing? - So what? - Is that lipstick? - Where did you get it? Was it you? What's wrong with you? What are you doing, you brat? - Give me that! - Hey, hey! Stop, stop. Let go of me. - Who do you think you are, brat? - No, stop! - I'll kill you. - It's not yours. You are stealing my things. - Mum! - Ma'am! Stop! - It's mine, Grandma. It's not yours. - I'm going to kill her. It's not yours. - I'll kill her! - Don't take her things. What's wrong with you? What the fuck? Hey! Consu. - Give it to me. - No. - I'll kill you! - Give me that! - I'll kick your ass! - Consuelo! - Let go of me. - Grandma! - Don't touch her! - Consuelo. - Mum! - You brat. Why do you use my make-up? Ok, Mum, calm down. Calm down. I'm sick of her. I'm fed up with her. - Okay, dear. - Sit, Mum. Ok. Ok, my love. Ok, my love. Keep crying. Enough Grandma, stop. Stop, stop, stop! Leave her alone! Mum! Mum. Enough, enough. Leave me alone, leave me. Leave me alone! Ok, my love. Let go of me. Let go of me! Consuelo, stop! Do you want to hit me?

Let go of me! - Ana, sit down. - Consu. - Sit down. - Hey. Leave her. Leave her. First thing tomorrow I'm leaving this shit hole island. I'm telling you. Ma'am... She's just a child. She's a child. She doesn't know. We're supposed to be teaching her. Is this how we're raising her? You're teaching her to steal. That's what you are doing. I don't like what you are teaching her. Shut up, please. Now. You, sir... - You know what? - Shut up. - Sit down and shut up. - No, no. You shut up! You're in my house. You're disrespectful. You've been disrespecting me for three days. I welcome you with the best I have. The best wine, the best grapes, everything I've got. Ok, my love. With the best intentions, to please you and your wife. Because I love your daughter. I love her with all my heart. - Stop. - Do you know why? Because she loves me for who I am. For who I am. She sees what's inside. Enough. Love, calm down. And she knows that deep down I'm a good man. A good man! I've made mistakes, like everybody. Or have you never made a mistake before? You're flawless! - I'm not talking to you. - You aren't perfect. Nobody here is flawless. Nobody! Don't tell me how I have to be. Then don't be cynical, ma'am! - Why? - Because you are a cynic! Same as that man in there. He is a cynic! At least we're not lying all the time. Who did I lie to? I'm right here, always facing off! Don't talk bullshit to me. - I offer you the best. - The best? Don't you like it? Do you want caviar? - I'll bring it. - Ok, then. - Lobster? - I want lobster! I'm going to hunt a lobster. Go ahead, that's what I'll eat. - You sit down to eat it. - Of course, I'm going to eat it! Sit down, I'll get it for you! Hello, dear. How are you? I'm going to kill that old bat. Don't say silly things. You have to forgive her. It's a very difficult time for a woman. It's a difficult age for women. Give me that. Give it to me. Consuelo. Give it to me. Ok, Consuelo. Give it to me. Stop. Darling. My precious girl. Are you more relaxed now? You like this? - Tell me you like it. - I like it. Do you like it? Do you like when I touch your belly? Yes? Are you more relaxed? Whose belly is this? Uh? Mine. - Mine. - No, it's mine. Whose tits are these? Whose? Say "yours". - Yours. - Yours, yes... Do you feel me? Do you feel it? Is it hard? It's hard. For you. Do you like it? Tell me you like it. Tell me you like it. - I like it. - Do you like it? Do you like it? Yes? Can I sleep with you? Just a bit? Yes? Just a bit. Quiet, ok? Patience, patience. Do you want me to unzip it? To play? A game. A game. I'm on my period. It's ok, darling. No, Grandpa... Please. And if we do it here? What if we do it here? Ok? It won't hurt at all. Ok? It won't hurt at all, darling. Do you want it? Tell me yes. Tell me yes. Oh, that's nice. Quiet, ok? Shhh. Quiet. That's it. We love each other, don't we? We love each other. Do you love me? I love you. I do love you. That's it, take it. Touch it. Take it. Stroke it. Stroke it. That's it. Stroke it, stroke it. Like that. Slowly. There. Oh, my darling. I love you. This is a secret, right? A secret between us. Roll over. Bye, darling. Sleep well. Let me. Let me, let me. I don't care, let me. Let me, let me. I don't care. Let me. Nice. Do you like it? Yes? Close your eyes. That's it. That's it, smile. Smile, darling. That's it. Give in, let me. Yes. You like it. Tell me you like it. Tell me you like it. That's it. That's good. Motherfucker. Son of a bitch. That's good. Ok, darling. Quiet, okay? Go to sleep. Go to sleep. You have to forgive your Grandma. She... is going through very difficult times. And I... I haven't had any love for a very long time. I feel so alone. I feel so alone. Bye, darling. Bye. Sleep well. You too. I love you. I love you. Really. You know that, right? I love you too. - I'm freezing. - Lay down. Oh, honey. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Fucking rat! Fucking rat! Stop! Oh, my love. I'm sorry, my love.
