- Yeah, yeah, I know the fucking deal. Come on, I've done this a million times. Don't insult my intelligence. No. 'Cause I said no, that's why. All right, look, we'll make the exchange tomorrow. Of course I got the money, it's right in front of me. Yeah, that's fine. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Sarah. Where the hell are you going? - I'm just going to Ben's. - Hate that little shit. All right, don't be back late. - Hey. - Is it that bad? That's why I called you here. We have to do it tonight. - Tonight, why? - The money's gonna be gone after tomorrow. Some people are taking it away. - I don't know. - Ben, I can't stay there any longer. - Okay. I'm with you. So just like we planned. - Right. - So where are we gonna go first? - Anywhere but here. - Hey. I'm going to bed. Don't wake me up. And stop reading those stupid comics. - Wait here. - Don't fucking move, asshole. I'm coming down. What the hell? Jesus Christ, I almost shot you. Ben, get the hell out of my house. Think you can steal from me, huh? In my own house? You're just a kid. Where are you gonna go? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I have to go. - Ben, Ben. Ben, stop. I have a plan. - This isn't gonna work. - It'll work. - Looks like somebody wants us to clean up their mess. - What are we gonna do? - What's in the bag? - Oh shit, man. One, two, three, it looks like 40 grand. - All right. Put the money in the car and help me with the body. - Man, I'm not sure about this. - Just fucking do it, all right? Come on. - Ben? - Sarah? - Are you home? - Yeah. But I'm worried. They're gonna find out. - Look, they're not going to find out just as long as you stay cool, all right? Just act like nothing happened. - How can I do that? - All you have to do is stay home and resume what you were doing before. Just, just try your best, okay? I'll talk to you soon. - Okay. Are you sure everything's gonna turn out okay? - I think so, I think so. - Okay, I trust you.

I'm hiding in my room. - Okay, calm down, ma'am, calm down. Please state your name. - Sarah Dawson. Please, they might come back. - Okay, Sarah. Officers have been notified, they're on their way.

Girl, Sarah Dawson, in distress. Two possible suspects. Approach with caution. I repeat, possible shooting and home invasion in progress. - Chris, we never should've taken that body. - We had no choice. - You're calling him? - Shut up. - What is it? - We made the pickup but things have changed. - What kind of things? - Things went wrong with the banker. My trunk is full. I need to empty it. - That's unfortunate. Did you get his journal? - No. - You need to go back to the house now and get me that journal. You understand? - Understood. I'm heading back to the house now. - You're kidding, right? We're going back to the house with a body in the trunk. - We don't have time to ditch the body. - Tim. I need you to do something for me. - The girl's inside and she's pretty shaken up. - Did she say anything? Did she make a statement? - No, not yet. Nancy's inside trying to comfort her. We found her in the closet. The girl's really a wreck. We're gonna get her down to the station, get some statements, see what we can find out. The current condition she's in... - We'll look around the house and lock everything up. - So, is this a murder case? - Without a body? No. The dad doesn't show up in 48 hours, we'll file a missing person. - All right, we'll leave you to it. - Did you see the way she looked at us? Do you think she knows we took the body? - Calm down. She didn't see shit. We gotta find the journal. - Maybe the people who killed him, they took it. - Shit. What are you doing here? - So, where's the body? - It's in the trunk of my car. - Andrew, take the body out of the trunk of your car and put it in the trunk of my car. Can you do that for me? - We don't need your help. Things are under control. - Help? I'm not here to help you. I'm here to find something. Something you haven't found as of yet. - We haven't looked yet. - We need that journal. If I don't find that journal... - You threatening me? - No. That wasn't a threat. But this is. If I don't find that journal, I'm gonna have to make sure that you and your partner don't have it. Understand? And by the way, did you search the girl? - Why would I? She's a kid. - Great, she could've just walked out with it. You remember whose daughter she is? You think she's learned nothing from him? - I get it. - Good. Now, go speak to the girl. Scare her a little. Find out what she knows. I'll look for the journal. - Let's go. - Andrew. You stay here and help me. - Is there anything else you'd like to say to me? You got anything to add to this or do I have your official statement? - That's all I can remember. - That's all you remember, are you sure? - She's been through a lot. I think that's enough. Can I get you something to eat, Sarah? - When can I go home? - Did you get her statement yet? - Looks like we have the official statement right here for you. - Great, great. Okay, I'm gonna need a few moments alone with Sarah. - Mm-hmm, okay. - Yes. Where is Sarah Dawson? - Who are you? - I'm her lawyer. I have a signed letter from her mother. I've been granted power of attorney. She's to leave under my custody immediately. - What's this all about? - It's not that simple. - It is that simple. You have her statement. She is to be released. - I just need a few moments alone with her. - Look, she's a young girl. She's obviously in shock. Give me a call tomorrow, maybe we can work something out. Otherwise, she's leaving with me, now. Come on, honey. - You saw my mother? - She charged me $10,000 to sign those papers. I took it out of your father's account. - What account? - My retainer. - You're my lawyer, right? Whatever I tell you is between us? - Yeah, between me, you, and your father. - My father's dead. - How do you know this? - I saw him die and I saw who killed him. I found this in his study. - Holy shit. This is everything. His bank accounts, passwords, names, payoff dates. But it's kind of useless without the encrypted files. - Well, I also found this. - Um, Sarah, this could put a lot of really powerful people in jail. You're gonna need to think hard about what you're gonna do next. - I already know what I'm going to do. - And what's that? - I can't tell you. - Hello? - Tell me the girl had the journal, 'cause it wasn't in the house. - Oh, Tim, she was lawyered up by the time I got there. There was nothing I could do. - A lawyer? So you didn't even get a chance to talk to her? - No, I mean, I'll call the lawyer tomorrow, set something up. - This puts us in a bad situation. Meet me at the garage. - Why? It's late. - I need you to pick someone up. - I told him we didn't have it, Chris. Get me outta here. - Be here in 15 or I dump him with the banker. Put the gun down, Chris, there's no need for that. We're just gonna have a nice, little chat. Then, everybody goes home. - Jesus. - He's fine. He's just sleeping it off. Don't act like you're so surprised. I told you this had to happen. But look at it this way, now I know you don't have the journal. - And what makes you so sure? - 'Cause if you did, Chris, you wouldn't be here right now. - So who has it? - There was only one other person in that house for sure. The girl. - So you think Sarah Dawson has the journal? - Why else would she need an attorney? - So what are you gonna do, kidnap her and beat her too? - No, she's family. Nobody touches her. That is, unless her uncle changes his mind. Let's wait for her to make the first move. Until then, take Andrew home. He's gonna have a hell of a headache. - Ben, you are late. Please get your notebook out. Cryptanalysis. It is the study of encoding and decoding information. Please write this word down. During World War II, the Navajo code talkers were a group of Native Americans whose primary function was to transmit secret tactical data. They served in the United States Marine Corps. The code talkers transmitted these messages using military telephones, radio communications nets, using informal and formally developed codes based on Native American languages. What is this? - It's just my homework for math class. - She left it in study hall. I'm just returning it to her. - Fine, just don't do it in my class, please. - What's up? - We have to talk. - Okay. All right. - I've been thinking. - About what? - About going to the police. - No. Ben, why would you even think of that? - I keep thinking about what I did. - What we did, Ben. Look, I understand how you feel. But we're in this together. I trust you more than anyone else in the world. That's why I gave you the journal to hold. I need you to continue making copies of the pages I asked for. Trust me, the worst thing you could do right now is to go to the police. - It would've been better if we just ran away. Anywhere but here. - Anywhere is here, Ben. We need to hold onto what we have. Promise me, Ben. Promise me you won't go to the police. Say it. - I promise, for now. - Will you hold onto the journal? It's not safe with me. - Yeah. - Jesus Christ. Either stick yourself or put that shit away. She's going to be home any minute. - I'm tired of walking around on eggshells for that bitch. Who died and made her queen? - I don't want her up in my ass about your shit. In case you hadn't noticed, she's paying the bills around here. - Yeah yeah yeah, so I've heard, yeah. - Oh shit, she's home. - The fuck are you... You're touching my fucking shit, stop. You're gonna fuck it up. - I'm touching your fucking shit. - You're gonna fucking stab yourself. You fucking bitch. - Is everything okay? - Of course. - I've got things to do. Coming, Audrey? - No, I've gotta cook dinner. - What do you got? - She does her homework, she draws, listens to music, and that's about it. Fucking bore. I searched the house every day. There's no journal, there's no nothing. You're wasting your fucking time. - Search again tomorrow. - It's your money. - So how was school today? - It was fine. - You know, Sarah, you can talk to me about anything. - Mm-hmm. - You know, it's just not normal, you holding in all these emotions. I'm your mother, and it's not fair to me that you never, you're always cutting me out. - I haven't been holding anything in. You've been out of my life for years and now you want to be my mother? Look, Audrey, I have to get back to work. - I'm your mother. Call me Mom. That's probably Rob. I'll get it. - Mrs. Dawson. Good to see you again. - What do you want? - I need to speak with Sarah. It's urgent. I'm sorry to bother you so late but I felt this was very urgent. I have an appeal here for a competency hearing. - Competency hearing? - Your uncle is challenging guardianship. - This is bullshit. I'm a good mother. I've changed. I'm the one that stepped up when her shit-head father disappeared. - Well... - You told me I had custody. What the hell do you get paid for? - Listen, I know this is emotional. - Mom, you need to calm down. - All we need to do is address these legal matters and that's all I'm here to do tonight. - Sarah, you can't trust her. She works for your uncle. - Mom. I need you to go upstairs and relax. I'll handle this. - Fine. Fine. - So, tell me, do we have any chance of winning this case? - Doesn't look good. I have a few of these police reports your uncle sent me. He's been doing a little bit of digging. Turns out your mom's friend Rob isn't really Rob at all. His name is Jack Wycoff. Guy's got a rap sheet a mile long. Possession of Class A drugs, aggravated assault, a bunch of drunkenly disorderlies, the list goes on and on. But here's the kicker. He's got a warrant out for his arrest, so not only is your mom a junkie, but she's a junkie harboring a fugitive. We have no chance to win this. I think you should take the guardianship change. Your uncle will let you stay at your old house. Sarah, you'd be home. Well, I took the liberty of filling out the necessary paperwork. I just need your mom's signature. - No. - No? Didn't you hear what I just said? We have no chance. And the authorities are gonna come around. Your mom's gonna get arrested. Is that what you want? - Don't worry, my uncle will drop the appeal. - Sarah, I don't think you know who you're dealing with. - I don't think you know who you're dealing with. I mean, who do you think's been running my father's business this whole time? - You? How could you possibly run that business? It's way too complex. - I'm going to stop payment of $3.8 million to six offshore accounts. That will get my uncle's attention. You tell him that if he wants that money paid, I will expedite it only when he drops the appeal. If not, I will stop an additional 3.8 million each week. - How much money are you handling? - Let me know when you hear from him. - Later tonight, this auditorium will be filled with citizens from your state. Why should they vote yes on Proposition Five in favor of the construction of a new prison? - Our prisons are overcrowded. The homicide rate in this state has risen to almost 9% in two years. That's staggering. - What's truly staggering is the $150 million price tag of the new prison. Isn't that asking a lot of taxpayers, not to mention the recent rumors of your connection to Gerald Dawson and the possible financial gains for you personally? - Look. My constituents aren't interested in rumors. What they really care about is jobs. Electricians, plumbers, corrections officers. Need I say more? I mean, this is gonna be a state of the art, modern facility that focuses on prevention and rehabilitation. It's a win-win for everybody. That's why I'm urging everybody to vote yes on Proposition Five. - Senator Seegar, I'd like to readdress the issue of the state's proposed land purchase from Gerald Dawson's development company and the unexplained disappearance of his brother and business partner William Dawson. - I'm sorry, but that's all I have time for today. - That's a wrap, people. Thank you, senator. - My pleasure. - Get the footage to them by five. - Got it. - By the way, did you see who walked in? - Gerry, nice of you to come on such short notice. - Frank, not a problem. - Hey, let's take a walk. - After you. - Look, Gerry, don't take me for a fool. Ever since your brother's disappearance, the payments were made on time and now, all of a sudden, 3.8 million's missing. Our mutual friends don't understand. - Okay, I'll tell you the truth. My brother's been murdered. - Jesus. Are you fucking kidding me? What's gonna happen when the press finds out? - Nobody's gonna find out. My guys took care of it. The body's on ice and it's gonna stay missing as long as I say. - You have the journal? - No, not yet. My niece has it. - Your niece. Your brother's daughter's been making payments all of this time? - Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. She made the payments. We had a little family disagreement and she stopped. All I need is a little more time to sweat her, that's all. - Time is not a luxury that I can afford. I'm too deep in this deal for this thing to go south. You need to see that these payments get made as soon as possible or I'm not gonna be able to control our mutual friends. You understand? - We got Twitter killing it today. You want in? Yes, yes, I know. I sold you something bad last week but this is different, I promise. - Hey, Jeff, listen. So, I was checking out the hit earlier. It looks like every form of index has been up for a few days now. - No, no way. There's no way this is happening. - No. Perfect. I'll get John to put one of our standard contracts and you're good. - I can put you in last week, I promise. Oh. Oh you wanted a hundred. Oh yeah, let me put 50 in yes, yes, yes. We can get you a lot, I promise. - Yeah, I know, we talked about that yesterday. Like I said, the paperwork will be filed tomorrow. Are you sure about the FDA approval? Thanks. Okay. Thanks for the tip. I want you to short one million shares at $1.88. Can you give me a three month window on that? Jimmy, your derivatives are falling apart after the $2 million hit yesterday. Get your shit together. Oh and, everybody, one more thing. It's time to dump every bitcoin we have. We've gotta milk that cow. I gotta take this call. Senator Seegar, what can I do for you? - William Dawson is dead. - I see. Well, he was a good man, efficient too. And that journal of his? - His daughter Sarah has the journal. This may be an opportunity for us. - Maybe. Maybe, I'll see to it. - What do you guys want, burger or hot dog? - I'll have a burger. - Yeah, one of each. ♪ I'll ride till the sun ♪ - You know, Rob tells some great stories. Tell us some stories, Rob. - I don't really wanna tell a story. I'm not really in the-- - Entertain us. Make yourself useful. - Yeah, Rob, tell us a story. ♪ My mother ♪ ♪ She's a sinner ♪ - All right, well, I'll tell you a story. So, when I was a kid, lived around the block from my friend, Johnny. And I used to go there all the time really just to get away from my own house. But one day, pull up to the door and his old man shows up and always in his underwear, holding a beer. Real prick. But I ask him, "Is Johnny around?" He goes, "Nah, Johnny ain't around." So I go, "All right. "Tell him I was here?" He stares at me and I turn around to leave, but before I leave he just goes, "Hey." I go, "Yeah?" He stares at me and he just said to me straight up, "This time tomorrow, you're gonna be dead. "You're gonna die. "Sorry, kid." I went home and I really believed it. I thought I was gonna die. I mean, I was just a kid. And I kept waiting and waiting, getting more and more scared, and of course, the next day, I wasn't dead. And when I realized that, it felt like the weight of the whole world was lifted off my shoulders. Following year, son of a bitch fell off a scaffolding. Broke his neck. Ended up dying like a week later in the hospital. Had a wife, five kids. Felt bad for them but I had a hell of a lot worse at home. The fuck? - Sarah Dawson? - Yes? - I need you to listen very carefully to me because your life and their lives depend on it. I'm gonna make a phone call and you're going to have a conversation with my employer. Do you understand? - Yes. - They're coming for the journal. - Sarah, I knew your father. I know you have his journal. Am I correct? - Yes. - So, it's safe for me to assume you've been doing business in his place. - I have. - So, why have my payments stopped? - I'm having a disagreement with my uncle. - What's going on between you and your uncle is of no concern to me. I need the journal and I want you to give it to my men, now. - No. The journal's mine. - Pick up the phone. - Oh god! - Now let's try this again, Sarah. I'm a reasonable man and I'll compensate you, generously. I don't wanna kill your mother, but I will if I have to. Give me the journal. - Sarah, give it to them. I don't wanna die, Sarah, I don't wanna die. Do as they say, please. Sarah, I'm your mother, dammit. Just give 'em what they want, I'm begging you. - I can't. - Pick up the phone. - Don't let them do this. Please. Oh. Oh. - Wait. I killed my father to get this journal. What makes you think I won't let my mother die to keep it? - This may change how we proceed. I need a moment to think this through. I'm putting you on hold. - What's the situation? Did she hand over the journal yet? - They killed Rob. They're threatening to kill her mother. She still won't give up the journal. I need a decision now. - Girl's made of stone. All right, take them out. - Kill the mother. - The journal's mine, asshole. - I should've known. I should've known. - I know what it looks like, Audrey, but I'm actually here to make things right. - Make things right? Rob is dead. I just saw him and three other guys get their fucking heads blown off. And you wanna make things right. When have you ever made things right? - Are you done? 'Cause I have business with Sarah. You can either join us or you can run away like the last time you abandoned her. - What's this? - Let's call it a peace offering. Inside that folder are the deeds to your father's property and his shares in Dawson Holdings. I had them all transferred into your name. - How is that possible? - I forged his name on the documents, had them notarized and backdated six months. This way, there's no bill of sale, no probate, and best of all, there's no tax on the transfer. - You forged his name. - I don't think he'll be filing a complaint. - What do you want in return? - Manage the journal and make the payments on time, to myself and my partners. - Like the ones who tried to kill us today. - That wasn't my fault. Sarah didn't make those payments. That's what happens when you act without thinking. Thankfully, Tim was there to cover your back. Look, you know the value of that journal better than any of us. If we show weakness now, they'll keep coming for us. We need to show a unified front. Hey, maybe it's a good thing what happened today. Don't get me wrong, I hate the fact that we lost Rob. But it sent a clear message. Our business is simple. We're not animals. We don't traffic in drugs or rob banks. We skate the law, we don't break it. That's why we don't go to jail for the things that we do. When we get caught, we pay a fine. Keep our clients' names out of the press. Pick up this folder and you'll be worth $30 million. You'll have access to all our lawyers, our accountants, and political friends. You can take your father's old office or work from home. The choice is yours. - It's okay, it's okay.
