[light music] [music ends] ♪ We were the oldest Ones of ten ♪ ♪ On one hot And sultry day... ♪ [man] So the music's building and building, right? And the singer's just screaming his lungs out, right? And everybody's head banging to the music. And I get so amped, and it's like, all right, it's my turn, and I just start thrashing, you know. And I don't even notice, but you know those rails up front? -Oh, no. -So I go. And then I just thump. -[both laughing] -Dude, I crack my head. [man wheezing] So freaking hard. And I just hit the ground, dude. -What happened to you? -I don't even remember. Like literally the next thing, I'm like in my car with my friends just driving home. [laughs] How long ago was that? Mm... That was like, um, I wanna say eight years? That was like another life, dude. Mom would get so pissed with me when I'd go to those concerts. Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in forever. What's it been like, uh, a couple months or something? Something like that. How's school been? Eh, it's fine. I mean, it's school. I'm taking, like, six credits, I think. Nice. How's, uh, how's work? Lame. My manager sucks. Wait, wait. Is that, um, uh, what's his name, Bryan? That dude that looks like a lizard? Yeah. Oh. He seems like he sucks. And, uh, everything else is good? You know, like you're staying... Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm staying clean. -How's Rachel? -Oh. Rachel is doing great. -Good. I really like her. -Oh, dude. I love that girl. I have no idea what I'd do without her. Honestly. I'm pregnant. [laughing] Oh, my gosh. [laughs] Dude, could you imagine? -When did you find out? -I found out last week. Uh-- Oh... Do you know who the dad is? I don't know. S-- Uh, Sarah... I'm gonna get it taken care of, don't worry about it. As in like...? Yeah. Could you really see me as a mom? Uh... [sighs] Well, it was good seeing you. Glad things are going well. Got a long drive back home, so I'm gonna head out. What's up? Can we talk, please? There's nothing really to talk about. -Are you serious? -Come on, okay? My appointment's next week. So that's it? Just get rid of it, who cares? Stephen, please. Can we not? Sarah, this is insane, dude. You have a child. -Do you even realize? -Okay. Don't give me that. Look, I've thought through it all, literally everything. There's nothing you could say right now that hasn't crossed my mind, so please. [sighs] Look, it was good seeing you okay, Stephen? I need to go. [starts engine] [knock on door] -Hey. -What are you doing here? I was just around. Thought I'd come see how you're doing. You were around? You live three hours away. Is that how long it is? That's, uh, crazy. Uh... Anyway, you doing all right? So... Uh... you're pregnant. That's cool. Look, I'm sorry if I overreacted last night, okay? I just wanna talk, please. [door closes] Hey, uh, who's all living here now? Just the four of us. We're all a pain, but we make it work. Cool. Nice. Nice, nice, nice. [Stephen sighs] Look, I just wanna know if you've considered everything that goes into this, okay? Yeah. I have. Like the fact that I have no money and no place to raise a kid. The fact that our parents are gone, and whoever the dad is is long gone too. -Where's the straightener? -Brittany, it's under the sink. [sighs] Maybe this isn't as complicated as you think, you know? [raps counter] Maybe raising a kid would be good for you. Or maybe it would wreck my life and its life too. Do you remember what it was like growing up without a dad? We were barely scraping by all the time. I'm supposed to want that for a kid? -[Brittany] Where did you say it was? -The sink, Brittany. -It's under the sink! -[sighs] [smacks lips] I'm just saying, this person... -They deserve a chance-- -[Brittany] Where is it? [both] The sink. The sink, Brittany. -It's always been under the sink. -There's cabinets underneath. You're probably just not looking hard enough. Rachel, my brain's all over the place right now, dude. -[Rachel] Well, what did she say? -I don't know. Like, she's already thought through all this stuff. I have, like, no idea what to say. Are you sure you can't make it tonight? I'd cancel, but I don't wanna bail on everybody now. Please? Babe, I know. I just have to finish this project by tonight, okay? Okay. No, it's fine. It's fine, no worries. I'll just have a nervous breakdown in front of all my friends. -It's cool. I know you'd like that. -I would love that. Can you make as much of a scene as possible, like you usually do? Yeah. Yep. Sounds good. Okay. All right. Thanks, sweetie pie. Okay. [distant sirens wailing] -[woman] Hey, man. Here you go. Yeah. -[man] Thanks. -[TV playing in background] -Hey, Sarah, you want one? Ah, no, I'm good. Thanks. Oh. That's right. You've been all straight edge lately, huh? -Trying. -That's good. -Hey, I'm trying too. -[scoffs] Can you get me one? [scoffs] Get it yourself. -Whatever. -[scoffs] -Hi, baby. -[kids' show on tablet] Can I see what's on your show? Here, I got it. -[counting song playing] -Perfect. Look right here. Wait. Oh, no! -You did it. Go on. -[game voice] Great job! [woman] So, what's new? What's been going on lately, huh? Uh, nothing, really. I just saw my brother, though. Your brother? Do I know him? -[door opens, closes] -Uh, you'd remember him. He's a lot. [laughs] He's a really good guy, though. Yeah, he is. [man] Am I a good guy? Oh! Hold up, hold up. Wait a minute. -No. No, I didn't have any other choice. -You said that last time. -You were the werewolf then. -No! No! Well, I mean, I was, but-- -She's fumbling, guys. She's fumbling. That's what happens. -What did you play? I played this, which means I fed our village. That doesn't mean anything. He could still be lying. -No. Come on, no. -She's getting a little defensive, wouldn't you say? I wanna know why Stephen's being so quiet. -I'm not being quiet. -Are you kidding me? Normally the whole neighborhood can hear him yelling. I'm not quiet, guys. Look at me. -Are you the werewolf? -No, I'm not the werewolf. -I'm not, guys. Look. -He's so convincing. I'm not the werewolf, guys. Don't do this to me. -I'm not it. I'm a villager. -[all talking at once] ♪ I'm not the werewolf ♪ I'm not. I'm not it. -No. Come on, don't. -Three, two, one... Look. [slaps card] Happy? You killed an innocent man. You guys feel good about yourselves, huh? I bet you do. I hope werewolves come pouring outta the woods and eat your legs, and your arms, and your face. Okay, next round. All right, guys. [deep voice] See ya. Later. All right, man. Well, I'm gonna head out. Thanks for having us over, dude. -Yeah, man. -Fun hanging out with everybody. -This was fun. -Yeah, have a good one. Yeah, you too. Yup. Hey. You sure you're all right? Dude, I'm like freaking out a little bit. What's up? My sister's pregnant. Whoa. Yeah. She doesn't know who the dad is, man. I know. When did you find out? She just told me yesterday. And how is she? Is she all right? Yeah. I mean, she's okay, it's just... She doesn't wanna keep it. She's already got an appointment next week. Yeah. Yeah, what? I mean, I'm sure it's tough. She's already had a rough life. I get it. What'd you want her to do? You know? I don't know, just, like, think through this or something. -You know? -Are you gonna talk with her about it? I just tried this morning, but she's got an answer for everything that I say. I've tried calling her before you guys got here, and now she's just like completely ignoring me. I'm just like blech. [sighs] I'm just gonna go spend the night at her house with her roommates, and just bug her to death. Yeah. Just pop up behind her every time she turns around. Like a cartoon. I'm just like, "Hey, Sarah. Hey, Sarah. Hey, Sarah. Here I am. Don't ignore me." That'd be funny. I might do that. What? Might-- might do what? Like, uh... you know, talk to her. Try to get through to her, bug her even, you know? I could head down after work tomorrow and see her. I'll just stay in town for her appointment. -[chuckles] That'd be crazy. -Uh, what are you talking about doing? -You're gonna have a conversation with her? -Yeah, go in town for a bit. And catching up with her, and just talking, connecting, brother and sister, you know? Okay. She'd probably appreciate that. -I think so. -Just talk things through with someone. Yeah. Yeah, be good. Yeah. All right, well, I hope that goes well. Yeah. I'll be seeing you, all right? Cool. Yeah. All right, bro. Yeah, see ya, man. Hey. You're just gonna have a conversation with her. That's it, right? You're not gonna do all that other stuff you were talking about? -Bugging her every time she turns around? -No, I'm not gonna be like that. I'm not gonna be all, like, weird and obsessive and whatever, you know? -I just wanted to make sure. Sometimes I can't tell. -No, dude, no, come on. You know me. [snorts] It's me. Yeah, yeah. All right, well... don't be an idiot. [Stephen] Okay. [deep voice] No, sir. Not me. [patting thighs] Hmm. I'm not an idiot. [roommates laughing in background] [Rachel] So you said you're gonna stay with Michelle? How long? Well... Sarah said her appointment's next week. So I guess however long before then to talk to her, get through to her. -Mm-hmm. -Something. I don't know what else to do. Hey. It's gonna be fine. You're just gonna talk to her. I know. It's just... I feel, like, so stupid. I didn't know her life was like this, and I'm just like... I don't wanna see her... I know. I know you know. That's why I go out with you, Rachel, because you know, okay? All right, I think I'm forgetting something. [kids shouting] [Michelle] Did you say she's pregnant? [Stephen] Yeah. Whoa. What's she gonna do? I don't know. She doesn't wanna keep it. That is a hard place to be. -You haven't seen her recently? -Nope, not since she moved out. Have you tried talking with her? Yeah. I don't know what to do, Michelle. I'm kind of freaking out a little bit inside. I get it. She's had a rough life. I know you both have, and this is a really tough place to be-- Boys! I'm trying to have a conversation with Stephen right now. I need you both to go play quietly in the other room, please. But Tommy poked me in the eye! -[Tommy] I did not. -[Michelle] No, stop. I need you to go play quietly in the other room, 'cause if you don't, I'm gonna take that sword and I'm gonna run it right through you! Go on. I mean that is a tough decision. It is so much work. And to do that alone? I can't even imagine trying to raise a kid on my own... [key falls] [sighs] [Stephen] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hold on, hold on. -Right there, see him? -[woman] Oh, yeah. -[Stephen] This guy, just a total douche bag. -[woman] Oh, really? [Stephen] Oh, my gosh, yeah. Doesn't he? Right? When he started arguing, I was like, "Dude, no. You don't talk to me like that." -[Lauren] So you told him? -Oh, I put my foot down. -Good for you, Stephen. -Because you gotta stand up for yourself. Can't have people walking all over you. Hey, Sarah. I'm back. [chuckles] Okay. Hey. So, I had an idea about, you know. Stephen, shut up. How are you still even in town? I'm staying with Michelle. Don't worry about it. Now look, I really think you can make this whole thing work. Okay? I was really thinking about it, and there's a lot of women in your shoes who have just, like, done it, you know? Not "done it" like sex, you know? Well, I guess you did. [chuckles] Uh, I don't wanna think about that. Uh, what I mean is they had the baby and figured it out, you know, because... it's a baby. Ooh... There she goes. [knocking on window] Hey. I thought we could grab some lunch and chat. -I'm working. -Oh, that's cool. Check this out. This is the different stages of pregnancy. And that's what your baby looks like right now. Isn't that crazy? It's a miracle. It looks like a frog had sex with an alien. What are you talking about? [man on TV] Yeah, I'm really happy to be here on the island. [phone chirps] I'm really looking for the one, for my soulmate, for that perfect one who I could share my life with... -[man continues indistinctly] -[modern jazz playing] [host] Hello, I'm Jeffrey Freeman, and welcome to... -Would you just listen? -Okay, you're not even listening to me. -It's a child, Sarah. -Stop! Oh, my gosh. Come on. [phone buzzes] [jazz stops] [phone buzzes] [jazz resumes] [Sarah and Stephen arguing over each other] [arguing stops] [woman] I got it! -Hey. -Oh, hey. Sarah's not here. Oh. Where is she? Oh, no, I don't know. Um, hey, where's Sarah? You guys know? -[Brittany] She's at that dude's house. -Who? [Brittany] That dude. Oh, yeah. She's at some dude's house. Um, Dan, or something? Dave? Oh, yeah. Dave and Hannah, right? Oh... okay. -[car alarm wailing] -[stalled engine cranking] Blech. What's up? Knock, knock, knock! -[woman] Stephen? -Yo. -Dude, no way. Hey. -What's up? Hey. -It's so good to see you. -Good to see you too. -Look at you, man. -Hey. What's up, man? It's going down now. It's going down. The party has arrived. It's going down tonight. Come on in here, man. -All right. -About to get this thing popping. -I'm serious. -[laughing] -Yeah. -Man, it's been a while. -It has, man. It has. Gosh. Yeah. And you are? Jason. Sick, dude. It's great to meet you. -Yeah, for sure. -So what brings you around? Just thought I'd come see you guys, you know, hang out, see my sister. -Aw. -[man] Right on. Yeah, man. So while you're here, you wanna hit a little something something? -Babe. -Nah. I'm good, man. -Still staying straight? -One day at a time, right? Okay. Okay, I can respect that. -Yeah, I hear that. -I'm sure you do. Stephen, can I talk to you for a second? Sure, yeah. I thought we'd just kind of-- -Now. -Sure. Hmm. -It's good seeing you guys. -[Dave] Good to see you. Yeah. We'll catch up, all right? Just give us a second. Cool. All right. Shit! [dogs barking in distance] So, Dave and Hannah's? I know. They're shit, and I'm shit. Hey, I didn't say that. Okay? You're not shit, and neither are they. It's just this place. -If you're not careful, you're gonna... -Yeah, I know. Why are you even here in the first place? Are you just gonna lecture me about the baby again? Look, I just wanna talk. Okay? Just have a conversation. Please? But can we go somewhere else? [sighs] Fine. Look, I just don't think you really understand what you're doing, okay? I know exactly what I'm doing. It's not like you just get rid of it, Sarah, -and all your problems go away. -So they go away if I have it? That's not what I'm trying to say. Then what are you trying to say? Look, having a child changes you, you know? It makes you better. Stephen, I don't wanna just get rid of it, okay? I'm not some insensitive monster who doesn't care. -I didn't say you were. -Okay, but that's what it feels like. Do you know how hard this is? A little part of me thought it might be a good thing. I was a little bit excited to be a mom. But it also terrifies me. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. -Well, sometimes you just figure it out, you know? -Why do you care so much? Why is this such a big deal to you? I've been where you are, okay? What are you talking about? When I was younger, I got a girl pregnant. It totally caught us off guard. After the initial shock, though, we decided we were gonna keep it. We just felt it was the right thing to do. I wasn't exactly living the way that I should, though. So I promised I'd get my life together. So time goes on, and eventually we find out it was a girl. But I didn't change. I kept living like an idiot. Then one day, outta nowhere, my girlfriend tells me she got an abortion. When I asked her why, she said she was tired of waiting on me to get my life together. Said she didn't trust I'd be there for her and the baby. And she was probably right. I think about that kid almost every day. She would've been five this year. I can't tell you how much it still hurts, okay? It's not like you just do this and move on. It stays with you, all right? And if I feel this way, I can't imagine how she feels because-- I get it. That doesn't change my life now, though, Stephen. I'm a kid. I'm a mess. I've been clean for, what, less than a year? I live in a house with three girls, and I can barely afford rent. Who's gonna help me? My roommates? My druggie friends? Or is it the dad that's just gonna magically pop back into my life? -I have no one. -I'll be there. What? I'll be there. I'll help raise the kid. I'll help be it's dad, or whatever. What are you talking about? If you have your child, I will help you raise it. -You're not even around. -Well, come stay with me. What? My whole life is down here: school, work, my friends. -You want me to just leave all that? -Then I'll come down here. At least help you get on your feet, then we'll figure it out from there. -Where would you even stay? -I'll stay with you guys. -In a house with four girls? -I'd crash wherever. -I could make it work. Who cares? -This is so stupid. -Sarah, we could make this work. -What about Rachel, or your job, or the rest of your life? Don't worry about that. I'll talk to Rachel. We'll figure something out. And with my job, they have a branch down here. I bet I could transfer to that, no problem. This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You said yourself you don't wanna get rid of it, right? Here's how we do that. -Stephen, just stop. -Sarah, we could make this work. -No, we can't. -Please. This is the right thing, okay? -Stop. -No, Sarah. This is the right thing. We can do this. We could be a family. No, we can't. -Yes, we can. -No, we can't. Sarah, yes, we can. No, Stephen. No! No, we can't. This isn't just as easy as me, what, having a baby, then all my problems float away? We're talking about me bringing a human being into the world, and I'm not ready. Thanks again, Michelle. Are you sure we can make this work? Yes. We can. I'll be there every step of the way, okay? -Whatever it takes. -Seriously? Yeah. We can do this, okay? Okay. Okay? Yeah. All right. Seriously? Yeah. -[laughing] Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. -Dude! Oh, my golly! Okay. [laughs] Okay. All right. Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Lord. All right. [exhales sharply] -Dude, you good? -I'm good. How are you? -[Sarah, laughing] Good. -Good. [woman] Oh, look at her. [Lauren] She is such a cutie. Hi. [woman] Hi, baby. -Too cute. She is just too cute. -Mm-hmm. Well, Sarah, I hope that this stuff helps you out. -Thank you so much. -Yeah, you're welcome. Congratulations, Sarah. Thank you. All this stuff, so nice. [sighs] Thanks for staying here. Yeah. It's just easier if I'm here. Newborns can be a lot. [sucks teeth] Oh, my gosh. Look at her. You made that. Yeah, I'm talking about you. Huh? Look at me when I'm talking to you. Whatever. Hey. We'll be all right, okay? Look. [deep voice] "Hey, Sarah. Sarah? Don't be sad. Be happy." [laughs] Stop. This'll be fun. Whole new adventure. Oh, there we go. A little pukey for me. Ooh, hoo-hoo, and poop. We got a lot going on. Mm-hmm. Did you puke and poop? Yes, she did. What's that? You want to go to Mom? -She wants to go to you. -No, she doesn't. -[man on TV] I'd have to pick Tiffany. -No. Are you kidding me? Why? She sucks. -[baby crying] -Oh! [shushing] [Stephen] Did I get the right size? I can still take it back if we need to. -What do you mean? -She only pooped a little bit. -That's disgusting. -They'll take it back. -Are you joking? No! -Put it back in the box. "Sorry, these aren't the right size." A little bit higher. I'll tilt it. -Oh. -Okay. Guys, I'm doing it. [Stephen] Dude, it's ordered chaos. [Sarah] There is no order to this, and you know it. Uh, yes, there is, and she's my niece, and she loves it. -I don't think she does. -Yes, she do, dude. -Disgusting. -No. Get over it. -Eww. Are you kidding? -What? -You want me to come with you? -Just get in the car. -I can't. -[baby crying] -[baby cooing] -Hi. You're supposed to be asleep, you know that? That's how you swaddle. She tucks it in. -It's kinda like baby origami. -Oh, yeah, exactly. -Hey, I can watch her. -Oh, no. I got her. She's just too cute to put down. Huh? Aren't you? I got her. [Sarah] There are so many dates in here, but I have no idea how they're all connected. -Where? -Over here. They don't make any sense. -Which paragraph? Right here? -Yeah. [reading softly] Okay, right here. See this one, there? This one goes down to this one with this guy. That goes up. That goes down. That goes over. And all of a sudden, you graduated college with an A-plus. -Why? -'Cause, look. That's how you graduate college. -Thanks so much. -Dude, I got you. [chuckles] I love the stuff you draw, dude. -[Sarah] Thanks. -Yeah. You can have that if you want. -Really? -Yeah. -I don't wanna take your stuff. -I have plenty. -[relaxed music playing] -[Stephen] It's so freaking cool. -And weird. -[Sarah laughs] [Stephen] Weirdo. Ha! Hey. I have the same one, dude. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. -Remember that day? -Yeah. [chuckles] We should get another. -We should. -Yeah. Let me get the baby. -Okay. -All right? -Okay, ready, ready? Let's make a face. Ready? -[Sarah] Okay. [camera clicking] [laughs] Okay. -Oh! -I love that. That's perfect. -Fantastic. -You have to send that to me. -Oh, I will. -That's definitely the Christmas card. [Stephen] That's Christmas card, right there. I love that. [Rachel] How's she doing? Good. Yeah, she's doing good. Baby's doing good, I'm doing good, we're all doing good. [Rachel] Oh, that's really great, babe. I'm so happy for her. I know. Me too. Hey, you know what? I should come up and see you this weekend. I miss you. Well, come on up. I miss you too. Hey, you should bring Sarah. It could be fun for her. Yeah, it would. I bet she would love that. Oh, my gosh, Rachel. You have the best ideas. How? [knocks] Hey. Me and Rachel had an idea. Thought it'd be fun if you came up and saw my friends this weekend. What about the baby? Hmm, she could stay with Michelle. We could head up Friday and come back Saturday night. -Hmm. -Just one night. Yeah. Yeah, that would be kind of fun. Yeah, I think so. My friends do get a little intense. So, just go with it, okay? I'm sure I'll be fine. [all shouting at once] I know it's him! I know it's him right over there! [all shouting] Three, two, one! -See? You happy? -Oh-ho-ho-ho! -Hey, check this out. -What? -You're such a freaking liar. -You lied to me. You suck. -You're a sucker. -Okay, anyway, Sarah, does that make sense? -[Sarah] Hmm-mm. -[Stephen chuckles] -Remember when we used to eat breakfast with Uncle Donnie? -Ugh! He would eat so many pancakes, it would actually piss me off. [Stephen laughing] -What are you guys laughing at? -Our fat uncle. Remember? Oh, that guy. Oh, brother. -Hi, Sarah. -Hey. -Have you guys ordered yet? -[Sarah] Uh, no, not yet. What'd you think of the gang last night? They were intense, but it was a lot of fun. Super intense, right? [chuckles] Oh. -Hey, how's the baby? -She's doing really good. Show me some pictures. Oooh! ♪ Girl time ♪ -[Sarah] These are the good ones. -[gasps] Oh. She is so adorable. Oh! She's adorable. I'm so happy for you. Sarah is a kick-ass mom, in my humble opinion. Look at that face. Look at her. -I believe it. -Stop. Mom, right there all over her face. -You should be really proud. -Thank you. Now the real important question is, what are you gonna eat? And if you say something healthy, we're gonna leave right now. -Stephen, I have to. -We'll leave right now. I've been eating fast food all week. No, you don't need to eat fast food, okay? What do you think, Sarah, healthy or junk? Just say junk. Just say junk, it's fine. -Just say junk. -Junk, because then I don't feel as bad. Gotta do it now, Sarah said it. Gotta do it now. Fine. Okay. I suggest the giant, hot cinnamon roll. No. Stop it. -It's what I think you should get. -Stop it! Okay. -It was so good seeing you, Sarah. -You too. I'll be right there, okay? You heading back now? We're gonna check out a few more things in town, then head back tonight. Nice. She's such a sweetheart. -Yeah, she's all right. -[chuckles] When will you be up again? Hmm... You know, soon. What? Just wondering how much longer we're gonna do this. What do you mean? You out of town, only talking on the phone, -maybe seeing you different weekends. -Eh... I know, I... She just needs a lot of help right now, you know? -I don't know what else to do. -I know. Does she think this is permanent? Are you trying to make this permanent? Because you told me-- No, I... [clicks tongue] [sighs] It's not. It's not. Sucks not seeing you. Sucks not seeing you too. Hope I can see you again soon. Me too. [Stephen] They're cool, aren't they? Yeah. I like 'em. They're, like, so big. It's like oddly comforting. [scoffs] I don't know. Glad you came up with me. Me too. What made you leave? What do you mean? Growing up, when you left town. What made you do it? Wow, that's, uh, quite a question. I don't know, just... that town, people... What? Did Mom ever tell you about your dad? No, not really. My dad died when I was like two. Then your dad came on the scene. He used to treat me and Mom like shit. He never wanted kids. He let me know that plenty of times. They fought all the time. And even when things got bad, and they got really bad, Mom still didn't leave. I don't know why. Eventually he got Mom pregnant with you. And that's when he bailed. Jackass. Sorry. Don't be. When I got older, I just went off the deep end. Did a lot of stupid things, hung out with the wrong people and... eventually I got that girl pregnant. Amy. I told myself, though, I'm... I'm not gonna be like my stepdad. After Amy got that abortion it woke me up. I was living like an idiot. After we split, I just looked at my life completely different. Is that when you decided to leave? Yeah. When Mom died, I was gonna try to come back, but... Michelle took you in, and it seemed like things were gonna be okay. I never meant to leave you guys, I just-- No, I get it. Really. I used to be so angry at my dad. I still am, honestly. Angry at a guy I didn't even know. All I knew is that he didn't want me. But no matter how angry you are, no matter how much you tell yourself you don't care, you still just want somebody to care. Yeah. You know what? This is your dad. Screw you! [laughing] Come on. Come on! Yeah, throw it. Throw it, throw it. Who needs you? We never needed you! -You suck! -You're just a coward! What kind of jackass leaves their family? You're a sad, sorry, flying sack of shit! [chuckles] -Whoo! -Whoo! -Yes! -Yes! [Sarah] Oh... [both screaming] Ohh! Oh... Come on, up top. Up top. -That was-- That was-- -Ow. -[chuckles] -Oh. Oh, dude. Okay. All right. Let's go home. [chuckles] I got work in the morning. First day at that new office. That's right. How do you feel? It'll be good. There's a lot of good people there. It'll be fine. [engine starts] Hey, do you know where the manager is? Yeah, he's right over there. Oh, okay. Thanks. [sucking teeth] [man chatting indistinctly] If you'd just hire somebody, I'd do it. It's not really that big of a deal, or it doesn't have to be. That wasn't my fault either, and you know that. Oh! Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. Okay, Dad. Dad, Dad. [clears throat] You are strong. You are capable. You are your own man. [clears throat] Oh, you must be the new guy? Uh, Sam? -Uh, Stephen. -Right. Bryce. -Cool. Good to meet you, man. -Nice shirt. Oh, thanks. I love this shirt. We have a uniform here. We wear polos. Not, uh... that. Oh, up in Cottonwood, we just kinda like wore whatever, you know. -It was really fun. -[chuckles] Yeah, but this isn't Cottonwood, and you know that. Ahh! We wear polos here. Uh... okay. Um... Anyway, I don't know if John said something, but he let me transfer down here -because my sister's in the area. -Mm-hmm. And she just had a baby recently, and I'm gonna be helping her with a lot of stuff. Random things come up a lot, so some flexibility would be really helpful, man. -I'd appreciate it. -Ah! I'm not thinking so. I know you're very good at what you do. John mentioned that plenty... [sighs] of times. But even though he's the CEO, this is still my branch. I can't have you just wandering off all the time. We run a pretty tight ship here. Yeah, but that's great, though. How old's the little kid? Uh... about six weeks. I'm gonna have Robert come and he's gonna show you to your desk. You need to work, okay? Robert, come on. [claps hands] There he is, the prince himself. Ha ha. Rob-- Don't touch me. Robert, could you show Stefan here to his desk so we can get to work? Oh, and make sure you get him a new uniform, so he's not looking quite so sloppy, right? Have a good first day, Stefan. -It's Stephen. -[Bryce] Uh-huh. Ready? -Sure. -Right this way. Okay. Yes. Yes. Thank you for your business. Okay, okay. [sales chatter in background] Oh, my gosh, yes. We appreciate your business so much. Thank you. Do I have to be in the corner? [Robert] Here you go. This is also for you. It belongs to the company, but it's what you're gonna be using. Oh, it's all good, man. I have one. It's specific to the branch. You have to use it. Bryce says so. Uh, okay. Hey. Bryce seems kinda like... blech. Huh? Bryce, just like, what a douche bag, right? -Never mind, dude. -Great. Um, if you have any questions, please let me know. Okay. Thanks, Robert. [acoustic guitar playing] -[baby crying] -Sarah. Can you please take her, please? -Can you give me a second? -Seriously?

I'm so sorry. [baby screaming] Shh! Shh! Shh! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Wait, aren't you free today? I thought you could watch her. Sarah, I'm literally about to leave in 20 minutes. -Why? Do you have work or something? -Yeah, I do. -Why are you just telling me now? -Stephen. I'm sorry, okay? My boss called me in this morning, and I really can't miss another day. Sarah, you can't just drop a bomb on me like this last minute. -Stephen, I know. I'm sorry. Just today. -I have to get to work. -What do you want me to do? -Please? Okay. It's fine. I'll figure it out, here. [Sarah] Thank you. I'm sorry. No, don't apologize. -Hey. -Thank you so much, Michelle. -Hey, no big deal. -Here. I hate to just drop her and run, but I gotta get to work. -It's okay. -All right, thank you. [Michelle] Hi. -[phone buzzing] -[sales agents chatting] Hey, what's up? He keeps wanting to get drinks with me this weekend, and it's like, "Dude, we did that last weekend. Let's try to keep things a little bit professional." -[Stephen chatting] -You know... I know. I've bought them like a hundred times. It'll be fine. [snapping fingers] Hey, I gotta go. Gotta limit those personal calls, bud. Yeah. Sorry, man. It was just my sister, she needed help with something. Just really gotta limit those personal calls. Tight ship, remember? She shouldn't be distracting you with whatever her problems are, you know? [chuckles] -Okay. -Yeah. Oh, how are those designs going for CI Tech? They want that soon. Great. Hmm. Good, I'm glad. Glad to hear it. [phone chirps] [Stephen] Hmm. [camera shutter clicks] Blech. Hmm. Oh, I was just getting a pouty face thing for Rachel. Okay. I got you. -Okay. -Yeah? -Hmm. -No, hold it higher. Like that. [humming back and forth] [camera shutter clicks] -How's that? -Yeah, it's a good one. -It's good? Okay. -I like it. It's a good one. -Hmm. Thanks. -Mm-hmm. [birds singing] Hey, can I borrow some money? For what? Uh, just for a few things for the baby. Hmm, like what? We just got some stuff earlier this week. Yeah, I know, but she goes through things fast, and I wanted to get her, like, a stroller or something. [sighs] Sarah, I... I don't just have infinite money, you know? [sighs] I took a pay cut coming down. I'm still getting everything else for her. I still got my lease on my other apartment. -I can't just keep pulling money from nowhere dude. -You're right. Sorry I asked. Sarah, it's fine. It's fine. We can get a stroller. -[women chatting, laughing] -[sitcom on TV] Sarah, are you kidding? Come on, dude. It was crazy out there. They couldn't stop me. -[ringtone chiming] -One second. Dad, I can't do this right now. [phone buzzing] -Hey, what's going on? -I tried calling, but you didn't pick up. -Yeah, I can't pick up at work. -I have a huge test tonight and I forgot to study. -I need someone to watch her. -You want me to watch her right now? -No, but can you watch her later? What time you get off? -Can we talk about this later? -Stephen, no, please. I need to pass this test. -No, you'll be fine. Trust me. -I believe in you so much. You got this. -Please, Stephen. Stop! [sighs] Gosh. -That your sister? -Yeah, sorry. She just needed help with something, and I can't take personal calls. Whatever it was, it could have waited, though, right? Is there really that big of a deal? Tight ship. Tight ship, remember? I really need you hammering out that project; she needs to learn how to handle her own issues. -Leave my sister out of this. -I'm just saying, I need you to focus when you're here, huh? -Why are you busting my balls? -I'm not busting anything. Okay, running a company just isn't easy, and we need everybody fully present. I just need people who won't undermine my authority, but people who respect me, like everyone else here. Is that it? Yes. Yeah. [Bryce giving pep talk, clapping hands] [baby crying] -Sarah. -I know. -Your baby is crying. -I get it, okay, I'm sorry. -She'll go to bed in a minute. -I have work at seven, dude, three hours from now. What am I supposed to do? [crying continues] ♪ Flowers are calling ♪ ♪ But bring me back May ♪ ♪ The sun's on its way ♪ ♪ Of heart and home ♪ Shoot. Sarah, have you seen my laptop? [Sarah] Seen what? My laptop, my work laptop. Have you seen it? Oh. Yeah, it's literally right over here. [softly] Shit. Shit. -Sarah? -[clattering] Sarah, what happened? What...? -What happened? -I am so sorry. -What? What in the world, dude? -I was putting formula in the bottle and it spilled over. -Why did you have it next to the laptop? -I wasn't thinking. -Yeah, apparently. Why were you even using it? -Can't you fix it or something? You want me to fix this? Huh? What am I supposed to do? Gosh, dude. Oh... Uh... Maybe someone at work can get the hard drive back. I don't know. And why did you let me sleep in, huh? -You knew I had to get up this morning. -What am I, your mom? -Are you kidding me? -Stephen, I'm sorry. Okay? Oh, gosh, dude. I gotta get outta here. How? How, how? Why? [sales agents chatting] Where have you been? I've been looking for you all morning. Look, man. It was a late night, I-- It won't happen again, okay? Yeah. It better not, okay? I need to see those designs for CI Tech. They're due by the end of the day. You told me they weren't due for a few weeks. Well, they must have mixed something up or something. I need to see where we are now. Okay. All right, I'll get on it. Okay? -I need to see them now. Give me your laptop. -Look... -Something happened, okay? -What's wrong with it? I just... What the hell is this? It's fine. The designs are on the hard drives you took yesterday, okay? -The ones I formatted? -You formatted them? Why? -Well, do you have them anywhere else? -Where else would they be? How many backups am I supposed to have? I don't know. You tell me. It's your responsibility. Now you get to explain to CI Tech why you don't have their designs. -Because you screwed up. -This isn't my fault. -You need to learn how to be more clear about these things. -How did you even get this job? You're the most incompetent, insecure prick I've ever met in my entire life. What, did someone just hand you this job, because-- Don't you dare. Don't you dare. My dad might have founded this company, yes. But I got this job because I'm qualified, okay? And, hey, at least when I'm here, I'm fully committed, right, not constantly distracted by some screw-up of a kid. How old is your sister? 17, 18? What a way to start your life! Hey! Don't talk about my sister like that. Why don't you just run on back to your desk and sort out this mess you got yourself into? -I got a better idea. -What's that? Why don't you get your daddy to sort this out for you? Wasn't he the one that got you this job, huh? 'Cause there's no way you got this on your own. Just hop on the phone with Dad like you always do. Just cry to Daddy, and-- [Bryce groaning] Piece of shit! [grunting] [shrieks] Uggh! Hey. Don't bother coming into work tomorrow. 'Cause you're fired. Yeah, I quit. [employees murmuring] [groans] Back to work. What are you looking at, Robert? [engine idling] [engine stops] [sighs] [softly] Oh, gosh. -[door opens] -[Sarah] Hey. You're home early. How come? Something stupid happened at work, I-- I don't know. Oh, no. Was it because of what happened this morning? -Don't worry about it, okay? -I am so sorry, Stephen. That was so bad. I didn't mean for-- Sarah. It's fine. They didn't fire you, did they? I... I don't know what happened. It was... It was insane. I can't even begin to explain it. -Well, what happened? -Please don't worry about it, okay? -It's fine. -Well, do you still have a job? Sarah, I literally just walked in the front door. I haven't had a chance to think about anything, okay? It's just, I don't know what we're gonna do if you're not working. Yeah, I get that. Can you just give me a minute please, to process this? Okay? Just... get this stupid work uniform off. It'll be fine, okay? [phone buzzing] Hey, John. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It was... Yeah, it was crazy. Yes. Monday? Yeah, yeah. No, I can be there. Mm-hmm. Absolutely. Okay. All right, yeah. I'll see you Monday. Thanks, John. Okay. -Hey. -Hey. History, your favorite. -Cool. Nice. Nice, nice. -Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna head home this weekend. Oh, you're leaving me? -Yeah. -Sorry. No. I just have to take care of some stuff. Yeah. No, no. It's fine, I'm joking. -I'm gonna leave here in a bit. -Yeah, sorry. That's funny. That's funny, that's funny. Okay. Hey, I... I just... I'm really sorry about what happened this morning. I feel really bad. -Don't worry about it. -No, I-- No, it's fine, seriously. -Stuff happens. -I feel awful. No, just an accident, so what are you gonna do? -Yeah. Um... -Okay. Well, have a good weekend. Say hi to Rachel and stuff. -Yeah, definitely. -Yeah. Have fun studying. Yeah. I'll try. Cool. Cool, cool. All right. Okay, see ya. Bye. [baby cooing] [camera shutter clicks] [Hannah] Oh, she is perfect. [newscast on TV] Babe, say something. Yeah, she's cute. She's adorable. -Can I hold her? -Of course. Hi. Oh, I know. Oh, I'm sorry. I know. Ah. Hello. [Stephen] Oh, my gosh, dude. I freaking love this movie. It's perfect. Holy cow. The part where she just jumps up and lands on his face. In the dance, and just her crotch is right in his face. Oh, my gosh, dude. It's so good, man. -I freaking love it so much. -Oh, stop. Blech! [chuckles] Ah, so good. When are you heading back? [Stephen clicks tongue] Hmm... Like, Monday sometime, I think. Stephen, I'm confused. Okay. When are you coming back? I don't know. I know you don't know, and that's the problem. I knew this whole thing was gonna be insane. I don't know why-- Rachel, I had to do something, you know? I know. I think it's great you're trying to help. It's just that this whole thing wasn't thought through at all. -I tried to tell you that. -I know it's confusing, okay? I'm sorry. I'm confused. I couldn't just, what, let her get rid of her kid? -It would've killed me, Rachel. -I know. I don't know what else I could have done, you know? She was completely resolved. She wouldn't listen to anything I would say. -I know, Stephen. I'm just-- -And at the end of the day, she had her baby. What would've happened if I wouldn't have stepped in? -Stephen, I know. -But you're right, this whole thing's becoming a mess. And it's, like, living in that town, and that house, and work, and trying to raise a baby. -And just the whole-- -Stephen! I'm not saying you shouldn't have helped. This is just hard. Okay? I know. Look. I'll figure this out, okay? Okay. I missed you. I missed you too. You know, you and the baby can come by any time. [Sarah] Yeah. You're sure she's... she's not, you know...? No. No, she's not yours. Cool. She's just, uh... she's a cute kid. Thanks. Man, you should have just, like, slammed Bryce's face right into the laptop. Just in the laptop, just close it on his head. "You like those designs, huh?" "You like the designs?" Rubbing his face into the keys. Dude, don't tempt me. Oh, man. Dude, like, what now? [sighs] John offered me a job back here. -Really? -Yeah. I mean, with everything that happened, technically Bryce is the one that, like, came after me, attacked me, whatever happened. Plus he was already on thin ice with John. Robert called him and told him everything that happened. -Who? -Nobody. Never mind. Well, dude, that's great. Yeah. -What? -I don't know, man. Just Sarah and the baby... I don't know what to do. I don't wanna just leave them, but... it's killing me being down there, man. I'm sure it is. It's a crazy situation you're in, man. Yeah, I know. I know. I get it. Well, when does John need an answer? As soon as possible. I just, I don't know. I feel cornered. I feel like I can't win. What? This whole situation's been weird from the beginning, man. And I don't know how healthy it is. Like, I've seen how being down there affects you. There's reasons why you left, right? I don't know, man. Maybe Sarah's all right. Maybe she'll be okay without you. Were you really gonna stay there forever? I don't know, I would just prefer not to see you fall back into-- Yeah, I get it, man. [Sarah] Hey. Hey. I wanted to talk to you. [zips bag] So, something really cool has come up. An opportunity opened up at my old office. You mean up in Cottonwood? Yeah. Yeah, they really need me back. And they're gonna pay more, like a lot more. This will really help with the baby, you know? Why would you take a job up there? Well, after what happened at work, I don't have a job down here anymore. I have to do something. No, I get that, but why couldn't you find a job that's closer? Like what? There's nothing really around here. Okay. So you would have to move back. I mean, couldn't you commute or something? Three hours? Are you coming back? -For what? -For what? Sarah, this is a good thing. This is really gonna help us. -You said that you'd be here. -I know. This is how I'm doing that. -No, here. -Sarah, what do you want me to do? I can't keep doing this, okay? Besides, I said I'd help you get on your feet, not stay here for good. Okay, well, I still need your help. You can't just ditch me. This is how you tell me? I'm not just ditching you. You know I can't stay here forever. I mean, come on, Sarah. This whole thing's not working, okay? I can't keep staying in this house. I've got nothing and no one down here. My whole life is back home. This whole thing is just crazy. -This was your idea. -I know it was. I know. And you know what? You also said that we'd be a family. We are a family, and I'm trying to take care of us. -By just bailing. -I'm not just bailing, Sarah. -I'm doing the best I can. -By bailing. -Come on. -Just get out of here! -Sarah, don't be like that. -[baby crying] I'll stay in touch, okay? And when I start my job, I can start sending money down. You know, and you have Michelle to help, and your roommates. -And this will just work out. -Forget it. -Sarah, it's gonna be fine. -Just leave. -[baby crying] -[door closes] -Sarah! [crying continues] [door closes] [starts engine] -[acoustic guitar playing] -[baby crying] [Brittany, banging wall] Is she going down soon? Yes, give her a minute. Thanks again, Michelle. I really appreciate it. It's fine. Look, this week's a little crazy, though. So I might not be able to take her very much. There's a daycare up the street. Why don't you check with them? Sure. Thank you. Yeah, I'm mainly just looking for someone to watch her during the week, because I work and I go to school and stuff. [woman] Of course. Now, do you need full-time care? -Yeah. -Okay, great. So just so you know, full-time care starts at 1200 a month. If you'd like, I can set up a time for you to come in and check it out. [music continues] [roommates whispering] [phone chimes] [baby cooing] [Sarah laughing] [relaxing vocals over TV audio] Sarah. Hey, is it okay if we start to clear some of this stuff off, because we have people coming over tonight? Sorry. I know. I'm just... And that smell? Where is it coming from? I literally just changed her diaper, I'm sorry. -Don't leave it on the table. That is so gross! -I'm sorry! -Just tell us so we can help. -I get it. I'm sorry! Do you know how hard this is? [baby screaming] Shh! Shh! Shh! It's okay, it's okay. [Michelle] Sarah, I'm sorry. I can't today. -The kids are outta control. -But I thought you could. My roommates can't, and I need to go to work. Guys, what did I tell you? Hey, I gotta go. Sorry. No, Michelle. Please don't go yet! Are you sure this is okay? Yes, I'm positive. You go. -[Sarah] Thank you so much. -You are welcome. Now go on. I got her. ♪ We are lost, just lookin' For an open door ♪ I am so sorry. I thought I had someone else to babysit her. Look, I know you got a lot going on, but I got a business to run here. -Hey. What's up? -Hey. Look, I'm so sorry to do this to you, but I can't cover rent for you this month. -I know. -I know it's been hard for you. I'm sorry, I've been getting all this stuff for the baby, and I can't. Okay, just please get it to me as soon as you can. [Lauren] You have to get her under control. It is two in the morning. I have work in the morning, and you know what? This isn't working! [baby crying] [crying continues] -[roommates arguing] -[Lauren] I don't know, can you just go stay with somebody? [Sarah] No. Who else would I stay with? [roommates all shouting at once] [Lauren] You living here in my parents' house with us is not working out. [Sarah] You know what? Forget it. Ow. [sighs] [contemplative music playing] [line ringing] [phone buzzing] Eeee! -Who's that? -Uh, nobody. -Dude, where's Alex? -I don't know, man. He, like-- [voicemail] Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. [Stephen and friend chatting indistinctly] [friend] I used to like hot food, but it just screws with my stomach. So, I don't know, I'm probably just gonna stick to salads or something like that. Oh, that's him right there. Oh, man. Finally. [contemplative music playing] [wind whistling] Screw you! [contemplative music continues] [engine starts] [Stephen] Dude, she scared me so freaking bad 'cause I'm like in my own world. And then I turn around when she says that like a cornered rat. I was just like... [grunts] Then it was love at first sight. Yes. It was love at first sight, right? That's the first time you guys met? -And not much has changed. -No. Yeah. And that's totally when you got her number, right? I was like, "Hey, you're totally into panic attacks, right?" Wait, wait, wait. Remember that little kid? Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So as I'm going off, before Rachel gets there, this little girl walks by. She's like, "Mommy, what that man doing?" [laughter] -And her mom is just like, "Sweetie, keep walking." -Keep walking. -Keep on moving. -"Just ignore that freak." Speaking of kids, how's Sarah and her baby doing? Um... uh... -Good. -Yeah? Yeah, um. Good, I think. You should have her over again sometime. Yeah, that'd be fun. She's so sweet. -Yeah. -Totally. Yeah, that would be fun. Yeah, it'd be cool. Hey, have you heard from Sarah recently? Um... Yeah. We stay in touch now and then, you know. Why do you ask? Just thinking of her, when Joel mentioned something. You really think she's doing all right? Yeah. Why wouldn't she be? Just asking. I know she has a lot on her plate. I'm sure it's tough. Sure. But, I mean, I'm sure she's handling it well. She's a pretty tough cookie. Yeah. It's still a lot, though. -What do you mean? -Just that I bet it's tough. Sure, but I bet she's handling it well. [chuckles] Yeah. That's what you said. Do you think I was making it up? I didn't say that. Okay. You don't have to get defensive. No, it's just not like I don't care about her. Who said that? Nobody. Hey. I'm not accusing you of anything. Maybe it would just be good to check in on her. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? It would. Maybe I could go down and see her after work tomorrow. -Yeah, she'd love to see you. -Oh, I know she'd love to see me. -I love seeing me. Hmm? Mm-hmm. -Yes, you do. [heavy metal playing] [kick drum thumping] -Hey. -Hey. [deep voice] Is Sarah here? [chuckles] Um... no. Do you know when she'll be back? So, Sarah actually doesn't live here anymore. She doesn't...? Stephen. Oh, you're looking for Sarah. Yeah. She doesn't live here anymore. Oh, okay. Um... Do you guys know where she is? -The hell if I know. -[Brittany] Where is the straightener? Brittany, it is under the sink! Sorry. Um... Maybe someone at work knows where she is? -I guess. -Yeah, okay. -Sorry. -No, that's okay. Yeah, thanks. Okay. Bye. [voicemail] At the tone, please record your message. -[beep] -Hey, dude. It's been forever. I'm in town, and I wanted to swing by and see you. So, just checking in on you, seeing where you are. Let me know and we can hang out, catch up. It'll be fun. So... Yeah, call me back. Okay, bye. [doorbell jingles] -Hey, excuse me. -Hi. Hey, have you seen Sarah recently? Um... no. -No? -We haven't seen her in months. She hasn't stopped by, no calls, nothing. -Uh... really? -Mm-hmm. Oh. Uh... okay. -Thanks. -[taps countertop] Yeah. [party music pounding in distance] [music growing louder] Having a good time? [indistinct chatter, laughter] Sarah? Sarah? Yo, yo, yo. -Hey. What's going on? -Hey. What's up, man? Hey, hey. Have you seen Sarah around here? Sarah, yeah. She's here somewhere. -Somewhere? Do you know where? -No, man. Okay, it's cool. All right, fine. Thanks, man. All right. Stephen? Hey. Hey. Hey, have you seen Sarah? -She's around here somewhere. -Do you know where? -I don't know. -Oh, okay. That's fine. I'll find her. Hey, Sarah? [knocking] Sarah, Sarah? Hey, are you in there? Hey, Sarah? Hey, Sarah, are you in there? Sarah? Sarah? Stephen, what the hell? -What's going on? -You gotta chill. Shut your mouth. I tried calling. I went to your house, your job. -Get out of here! -Sarah, why wouldn't you respond? And where's the baby? -Look, man. I'll-- -Jason, get out. I'm just trying to explain she was the one that came onto me. I swear if you don't get outta here right now, I am gonna beat your ass to death. Stephen, you can't just barge in here and freak out. -I'm trying to figure out what's happening. -Leave! -What is happening and where's the baby? -Oh, like you care. -I'm trying to look out for her. -Oh, you're looking out for her? -I am, Sarah. Where is she? -Get out! Sarah, where is she? [party music continuing] [indistinct chatter, laughter] -[music stops] -[chatter subsides] Hey. Excuse me, everybody. Get your attention? Cool. Has anybody here seen a small human? Little baby girl, probably about this big or so, really cute eyes? Anybody? Anybody? Anybody? Baby? Come on. Someone? You? I've seen a baby before. Great. Anyone else? -Baby? Someone? Anybody? -What the hell are you doing here? -Tell me what's going on. -Tell me why you're here. -Sarah, I want to know where your child is. -You don't even care. -You're at this party screwing around... -Fuck you! -[door slams] -Okay. That was a little awkward. But you know what? You guys have a great night. Keep rocking on. Seems like a lot of fun. Okay. -I'm out, all right. -[door slams] [murmuring] What the hell was that? Why are you even here? -Do you live here now? -What's it matter to you? Are you kidding me? You're raising a kid in that? -Where is she? -She's fine. She's with a friend. -Who? Well, what does that mean? -Why are you here? I couldn't get ahold of you. You wouldn't pick up your phone. I go to your house, and you're kicked out. You're not showing up at work. And are you using again? -Don't you start with me. -Why didn't you tell me this was happening? -Oh, like you care? -I do care. Now, come on. We're gonna go get her. -What? -We're gonna go get your child, okay? -You can't just order me around. -I'm not ordering you around. I'm trying to take care of your kid, because I don't know what you're doing, living in this shit. -Now come on. -Come on and what? Go get her, and then what? -What are you gonna do? Where are you gonna go? -We'll figure it out. No, we won't figure it out. And you want to know why? Because you don't think through anything. If you don't come with me right now, I'm gonna make a scene again. Go ahead. You know what? Fine. I'll go get her. -Where are you gonna go? -I'll find her. Hey. Hey! Hey! You better not go get my kid. Don't you dare. What is happening, Sarah? I come back, and you're living with them. And, what, your baby's with just some random person? What is going on? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I've been busting my ass every single day, trying to take care of a human being. I've been trying to go to school, work, and raise a kid. Life is just how I said it was gonna be. So sue me if I try to have some time to myself every once in a while. -Well, you chose this. -Oh, I chose this. You think I wanted this? I didn't wanna have a kid in the first place, but who's the one that rode me day and night, telling me it was the right thing to do? Who was the one that constantly preached at me, saying it was a life? Who's the one that said they'd be there with me every step of the way? You, Stephen, you! This was so fucking important to you. But where were you, huh? You think a text once a week, maybe, or just throwing money in my face changes our lives? You call that a family? I love that kid, more than I thought I would, and I was actually excited, I was excited to raise her with someone, and I thought you were too. But guess what? Here we are. I'm officially a single mom, barely even keeping myself alive. My life changed forever, while you got to float away and do God knows what. What was this for, Stephen, huh? Fixing some failure in your past? At what? My expense? This was all about you, wasn't it? Well, I guess you won, didn't you? We did the right thing. You did the right thing. Thank God for Stephen, savior of the unborn. But you know what? You never really thought about us, did you? You didn't really care. And when it really mattered, you ran away. You're just like my dad! Just like every other shitty man in my life, running away, abandoning me, leaving me to figure it out all on my own? Okay, I'm trying. I'm really trying to be a good mom. I know she deserves so much more, and I wanna give it to her. I wanna give her everything I can. But all she gets is no dad and a shitty mom. It was so important to you that I had that kid. But you didn't want anything to do with us. Some family. [somber music playing] [groans] [traffic passing] God help me. [dog barking] Hey. You have a second to talk? Just real-- [sighs] -[door opens] -[gate opens, man calling dog] What? Sarah. I was so stupid. I never meant for any of this. -I can't even begin-- -Please. Look, I had an idea. I really thought through this, okay? I'm not saying this fixes everything, or what I did. But I'd love for you guys to come stay with me. I know it's not much, but it could get you outta this place, you know? It could really help you get on your feet with everything. I'm placing her. What? I'm placing her. It's called, like, delayed parenting or something. Some other family's gonna take her, and if I meet certain criteria, I can have her back. I need to get my shit together. Oh. Okay. Sarah. I'm sorry. I'm gonna take her today... to the family she's gonna be with. You can follow me there if you want. Okay. Yeah, sure. [rooster crowing in distance] -Hi. -Hi. -Thanks. -Yeah. Offer still stands. If you need a place to live, you can come stay with me. -Could be a good thing-- -Cool. [engine starts] [door opens, closes] [phone buzzes] [knocks on door] -Hey. -Hey. Can I stay here, just for a few nights or whatever? I just need to clear my head. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. [Stephen] Hey, you can actually come over here. [mystical music playing] I hope it's okay. I guess I'm taking the couch again. I can move everything if you want. No. It's okay. You hungry? Sure. [dishes clattering, patrons chatting] [somber music playing] Hey. Hey. It's gonna be okay, all right? It's gonna be all right. It's okay.
