RISA: I've been training in track and field since I was little. I had no idea I could catch a Pokémon! ASH: Awesome! Then you're quick on your feet? RISA: This might surprise you, but I was the regional champion. ASH: That's awesome! RISA: But then... RISA: I gave it up. ASH: Why's that? RISA: I got injured. It's healed up good as new now, though. ASH: Whoa... RISA: I suddenly got scared to run. PIKACHU/EEVEE: [PLAYFUL] ASH: I think now that Eevee's here, you'll be able to run again. RISA: How come? ASH: I mean... ASH: What you can't do on your own, you can do with a Pokémon pal there by your side! PIKACHU: [QUESTIONING] RISA: Really? RISA: Officer Jenny? What's wrong? HARRIET: Hey, Professor!

TOREN: Ah, yesterday's chemical spill... TOREN: Of course that spill was the essence of a Pokémon move that we call Sweet Scent. TOREN: Pokémon love the smell, so they gather around... HARRIET: What kind of useless chemical is that?! HARRIET: I don't want any Pokémon anywhere near me! HARRIET: I want that stuff neutralized, now! TOREN: Wait. I'm afraid... I have nothing prepared... JASON: Toren! CHANSEY: [QUESTIONING] JASON: There's trouble! We just got word from the festival admin!

CALLAHAN: The doctor just finished examining her. CALLAHAN: She's never had the best energy or stamina. CALLAHAN: I guess the last couple of days have taken their toll. TOREN: I'm so sorry. I'm responsible. CALLAHAN: No. It was my fault for lying to her all the time. TOREN: How'd it go? ASH: No luck. I'm afraid we lost them. PIKACHU: [WORRIED] ASH: Wait is Eevee hurt?! RISA: Yeah. It got caught in the panicked crowd after you left... RISA: But now, Nurse Joy's treatment helped out a lot. RISA: It'll be fine. ASH: I'm glad. ASH: That Team Rocket... TOREN: I'm afraid what Team Rocket stole was Effect Spore. ASH: What about Officer Jenny? TOREN: I filed a report. She told me that she was going to investigate. HARRIET: I'm sure we're tired.

It would've been better. RESEARCHER 1: Next time, say something before we all meet up! JASON: Enough of that kind of talk! JASON: There's no one who's more concerned about the welfare of Pokémon than Toren. JASON: Which one of you loves Pokémon more than Toren? JASON: Does anyone know more about them than he does?

RISA: Does that mean that Lugia doesn't know where to send the wind anymore? MAYOR: Yes. HARRIET: We need the eternal flame. By the end of the night. No later than dawn tomorrow.

TOREN: I thought I can use it for marking, but the chemical is invisible after distilling its essence. TOREN: Except this light reveals it. PIKACHU: [SURPRISED] TOREN: There. Case in point. MAYOR: Incredible. ASH: You did it, Pikachu! PIKACHU: [PROUD] TOREN: If we follow these, it should lead us straight to the culprit. ASH: Then let's go! MARGO: Wonder if it's been called off.

MARGO: It isn't Zeraora's fault! I did everything! RISA: That's Zeraora? HARRIET: Yeah. RISA: The stories said it vanished. TOREN: But there it is, in the flesh. TOREN: This is it...isn't it? MAYOR: Do you have any idea how much trouble you have caused? For everyone. MAYOR: Margo... MARGO: It's only been a little while since I first met Zeraora. MARGO: I was playing with the Pokémon in the foothills of the mountain... MARGO: Suddenly, there was a rockslide. DITTO/TEDDIURSA: [SCARED] MARGO: I should have been crushed by that boulder. MARGO: Zeraora is the one who protected me back then. MARGO: But by doing that, Zeraora was badly hurt! MARGO: It was all my fault! MARGO: So I vowed to help make it well again! MARGO: Everybody in town seems to be so afraid of it. MARGO: I thought that at least I could be its friend... MARGO: ...and take care of it until it was all better again. MARGO: But then they said someone knew of a rare Pokémon. MARGO: And I knew...that everybody would try to catch it. MARGO: That's when...I thought that if the Wind Festival was called off... MARGO: I knew it would cause problems if the eternal flame was taken... MARGO: But I was gonna put it back the minute the festival was canceled! MARGO: I'm sorry! I'm really, really sorry! ASH: Margo... MAYOR: Margo... MAYOR: Thank you for protecting Zeraora. MAYOR: There's something I need to talk to you about. MAYOR: Regarding the truth about Zeraora. MAYOR: Zeraora lived in this area for a long time. MAYOR: It was master of the land, beloved by Pokémon. MAYOR: And they all lived in peace. MAYOR: So what did we humans do? MAYOR: We cut down the forests that were home to the Pokémon... MAYOR: Looking to enrich our lives. MAYOR: The reason for the mountain fire? We did it. That was fifty short years ago. PIKACHU: [CURIOUS] MARGO: No way... MAYOR: Fire was everywhere! MAYOR: And people never thought for a moment of the wild Pokémon living there. MAYOR: Everyone was in a panic. MAYOR: But Zeraora was the only one who never gave up on saving the many Pokémon left behind. MAYOR: Ever since, Zeraora has been deeply angry with humankind. MARGO: I see. That's why. MAYOR: You see, people did things that made Zeraora trust them less and less. MAYOR: All Zeraora wanted was to live in peace with the forest Pokémon. MAYOR: But huge numbers of Trainers gathered in the forest to catch Zeraora! ZERAORA: [ANGRY] ZERAORA: [AGGRESSIVE] MAYOR: The previous mayor, wishing to make up for this injustice, decided to lie to the townspeople. MAYOR: He said that Zeraora had vanished, and the mountain was cursed. He forbade anyone from entering the mountain again. MAYOR: He did it hoping to protect Zeraora. It was the only thing people could think to do. ASH: That explains it... HARRIET: Very few people know about it. Very, very few. HARRIET: And even fewer young people. MAYOR: And that's... MAYOR: ...the truth about Zeraora. CHANSEY/MACHAMP/HERACROSS/SMOOC HUM/ TOTODILE/TOGEPI/TYROGUE/ MARILL/XATU/DITTO/TEDDIURSA/ PIKACH U/EEVEE: [SHOCKED] ASH: What was that?

PIDGEY TRIO: [EXERTION] / [WEAKENING] TOREN: The color of the smoke...and these symptoms... TOREN: It's possible that this is Effect Spore... ASH: Hey, Team Rocket stole that! PIKACHU: [ALERT] TOREN: Correct. Chansey, use Aromatherapy. CHANSEY: [AROMATHERAPY MOVE] MAYOR: Tell me about this Effect Spore... What is it? TOREN: I was in the process of researching it. TOREN: Since it's a chemical version of the Ability, Effect Spore, I kept it in a capsule. PIDGEY TRIO: [AWAKENING] / [EXERTION] RISA: What does that have to do with these Pidgey? CHANSEY: [SATISFIED] TOREN: When you breathe in that chemical, it becomes a poison that numbs your body. ASH: That's what the smoke was. RISA: Why would you ever make that? TOREN: During my research, I found that it's also effective against certain human diseases. MAYOR: Yes, it's me. SECRETARY: Your Honor, I have a report. SECRETARY: There's been an outbreak of an unknown smoke, engulfing a quarter of Fula City. SECRETARY: It's spreading as we speak. SECRETARY: Anyone who breathes it experiences numbness, so we classified it as a poison. SECRETARY: We have also ordered emergency evacuation of all affected areas. SECRETARY: There's not a moment to lose! Please return to the city! MAYOR: Understood. MARGO: Oh, no, Father... TOREN: It's all my fault. PIKACHU: [SCARED] EEVEE: [SURPRISED] ASH: Let's go!

MAYOR: Professor, is there any way to disperse the smoke? TOREN: Now let's see. I could go back to the lab and produce large quantities of the essence of the Pokémon Ability Natural Cure... TOREN: But it's no use! There's no way to spread it throughout the city! HARRIET: What about using the wind to do it? TOREN: The wind? HARRIET: There's the old generating station. MAYOR: You're right.... MARGO: But wait, I thought that it was broken down. MAYOR: Harriet? If you can't fix it, no one can! RISA: What do you mean? HARRIET: You see, I built that power plant. RISA: Granny, that is so cool! HARRIET: I built the propeller so it could run backward, too. HARRIET: If you run it in reverse, it will cause wind to blow. HARRIET: Question is, will it still spin? HARRIET: I give it a fifty-fifty chance. TOREN: Fifty-fifty? ASH: Yes! We can do this! PIKACHU: [ENTHUSIASTIC] HARRIET: You scamps will have to help, too! We're going to need some muscle! MACHAMP/HERACROSS/SMOOCHUM/TOTO DILE/TOGEPI/TYROGUE/MARILL/XATU: [ENTHUSIASTIC] MAYOR: Very well. Toren and Harriet, you need to go to the power plant. ASH: Risa, Margo, and I are going to stay here, and treat Zeraora and the wild Pokémon, then we'll lead them to safety. TOREN: Smoke is heavier than air, so the tops of the mountains should be safe. TOREN: And take this. Super Potion. TOREN: It will help heal injured Pokémon. ASH: Thank you, Toren! MAYOR: All right, everyone... MAYOR: Good luck to you! OFFICER JENNY: Remain calm and orderly!
