' 'The End' 'Save' Executive Producer KANG Woo-suk Executive Producer KIM In-soo Associate Producers KIM Joo-sung JUN Sang-min Shit~ Produced by KIM Eun-young That loser is a typo in my life. Director. Hey, I'm done, take a look. He's the fucking... director I'd love to delete from my life. It just needs scene numbers and a little editing. No, that's ok. Just send it to the producer. And we'll pack up and leave. What are we doing here wasting a fine day like this? I don't get it. We just have to jot down our own lives... The hero's a screenwriter... so why doesn't it seem real? I was robbed of my cigarettes and forced to. We'll just rewrite it again... We need to recharge and go! We can do it! Shit, we're doing nothing but recharging... I can't even tell off that loser. Tell him to get his own shit together. The new ending you suggested is better, right? Directed by KWON Chil-in Ending... what will my own ending be like? Directed by KWON Chil-in Tragedy? Or comedy? HELLCATS What? Two days will be enough? Didn't I warn you it'll take longer? The old power lines are a mess! Huh. What am I supposed to tell our clients?! You should've double-checked, you idiot! Hey, I'm home... You want to make me look like a total fool? It's your ass if we're not done by opening night! Get it done, now! Fast won't do! Finish it! - Mom, your coffee. - Awe shit! Here... Yuck. KIM Kang-ae! Didn't I say, 'don't change the coffee? ' Why drink it decaffeinated? Milk would be better. At least it's good for you! Then drink milk if it's so good for you! Shit, it's my birthday today! How can you be so oblivious? A hot meal for your baby sister is the least you could do! Some birthday this is! Happy birthday, auntie! You're even worse! My only niece treats me like a boarder! At least a boarder pays rent! What? And stop ordering stupid things. There's nothing but your shit in the mailbox! What's it for when you can't even afford cosmetics? I'm leaving this hellhole. That's what you want, right? Please do that for me, okay? - Then I'm taking her room. - Okay. Why were you born? With such an ugly face... Why were you born? You've got some nerve when you can't even give me a decent party! I was going for a laugh. Would you laugh when you just had cereal for your birthday? Then move out of your sister's place! And come live in this dump? Hey, it's my home and I'm paying rent. Home? It's a refugee camp where all your bum buddies crash. NA Won-suk! Clean up after yourself for god's sake! Empty the ashtray and clean up your shit! Trash is all over the place... I stopped by the department store for that. How much? How about... finding a place to live together? I've got no money. Hey, we've been spending enough on meals and motels... When I get my down payment it'll pay for the deposit. Spending your part-time earnings on rent will leave us penniless. Right, didn't you say you received a card from some company? With my 3 thousand... How much do you think you'll get? Two thousand? Five? What do you think of this melody? Nice huh? Uh? What's that? Stop talking about money, I've got none! Fine, but I'm more worried about not having worked for so long... Come on, you're a professional. Which means you want me to do it for nothing... - What's the height of the stage? - About seven or eight meters. That's the problem. The entrance is too narrow. This is Kyung-soo, 7th cycle. This here is Kim Young-mi... She's my direct senior in line. Beware she used to be a man-killer. Nice to meet you. Your hand is cold. They say cold hands, burning body. Enjoy, thank you. It's LEE Ho-jae who's more to blame. Three years into the relationship... He should've made a move already. This isn't Brazil you know! Amar e de coracao, garota. Love is courage, girlfriend! Didn't I tell you not to say things I can't understand? You want me to explain it to you? Ho-jae is... this. - G - G - A - A - Y - Y g-a-y, gay? Give me a break! The gay guy's here, the gay guy. For crying out loud... You're early today? We've still got half an hour left. Sorry, but I can't drive you home. The shop's just got a new bike. Wow you're finally buying one? Excellent, LEE Ho-jae. Just wait a bit longer. You'll be the first to ride my bike. You want to join? It'll hold three... I mean... I won't be living off you forever. You'll have to beg me to stay once I've made my breakthrough! So when will this breakthrough happen? Li'l sis... you moved in three years ago, singing the same old tune. Hey! Didn't I say it's my birthday today? You're a work-in-progress, but one that will never end... You little twerp! Should you be drinking when there's a blind date tomorrow? It's not my idea. Your other aunt just wouldn't stop nagging me. Does your pet boyfriend know about this blind date? It's nothing serious anyway. But it'll break his heart... Awe whatever! Wake up! Love won't put bread on your table. Perfect marriage stipulations won't give you happiness either. I'm just saying it's not enough. So what's your point? That I should work my ass off till I die, like you? Unfortunately you're not capable of doing that either. You want me to die of aggravation on my birthday?! Birthday? What's the big deal? You have one every year. Thirty two year old accountant. Looks, not too bad. He's been posted here from head office in the US. Look at his style... that unbearable 7:3 hair parting. No thank you. And he doesn't even smoke. What a barbarian! Why are you staring at me like that? No it's just that your hairstyle's so proper. Do you know why the lettuce blushed? No. Because it saw the salad dressing. Huh, yeah... I see, right... Then why is a man lost in the desert able to survive? I don't know. Because of all the sand which (sandwiches) is there... Right... What did the sandwich tell the knife when he complained of... her edge (age). Edge? Cut it out. Cut it out, I get it. Hey, Won-suk! - Were you sleeping? - When did you come in? Let's have some fun man. Open up. My feet are killing me. Let's go over there. There. Come here. Why? The boys are sleeping in there. Good, they can join us for a drink. - What for? - What's up with you?! - Hey, hey! - What's your problem? Ah-mi, watch your feet. - Come out here for a second. - Let go of me. - Watch your feet. - I'm leaving. - Move! - Hey, your feet. Ah-mi, just hear me out for a second. Let go! So is this what you had to work on all night? It's not what you think... Were you also banging some girl when you disappeared... ...for music practice? How could you do this to me? And you call yourself a man?! Okay, I fucked her! We were drinking while monitoring my music. - She seemed to get me... - Get you! What's there to get? Do you even get me at all?! It's always money, marriage. I hate talking about that stuff! Yeah, I don't earn much! So how the hell am I supposed to get married, goddamn it! You always made me feel like shit. I had to get out... Shut up! Some nerve you have... And what about you? Where have you been all dolled up like that? You've been on a blind date, haven't you? You and me, we can't live like this. Okay, you've overcome your fear. Lesson 2! 'Seduction'... Follow my lead. Squint your eyes dreamily. Open your lips a bit and lick them in a sexy way. Are you kidding me? Do it right! Look. Dreamy eyes. Straighten your shoulders! Lips slightly parted. Sexy, with your tongue. Mi-ran, you must have ate garlic! Shit, you stink!! - I do not stink! - I can't do it. - You can! Yes you can! - Forget it! Heavy traffic. Will b there in 10. I've been waiting for an hour, you son-of-a-bitch! I miss u, Ah-mi. Which means you wanna fuck, right? Sleep tight, sweet dreams. Luv u. Shit, you give me nightmares. Love, my ass... I'm gonna kill you! Aunt Ah-mi! Come eat. You can kill him later, but first you need to eat. Don't you know. I hate eggs in my ramen? Then don't eat it... Ouch, it's hot! Shoe-winging around~ shoe-winging around~ This crowd's a mess. Let me pull you out of your shell. And put you back in your p-lace. What a crock! - I really should get going. - You're leaving? Have fun... - I'll take care of the check. - You don't have to do that. Ms KIM will take care of the check. Have fun! See you! Thank you. Are you leaving already? With one less senior around, you'll have more fun. I'm unusual enough to enjoy my seniors' company. I'm not that into unusual people. You wanna bet whether you're into me or not? I'm not so good at bets. Here. I don't drink vending machine coffee. I know a place that has terrific coffee. Okay? Hey lady, why do you do it? Why, couldn't get aroused? I mean, why are you in theatre? It's not much money. They same reason why you're in when in fact, you're dirt poor. Then... is it regret? No, good bodies. What's this smell? What? The scent of a man. You don't like it? Who wears that these days? Fabulous goods shine no matter what you put on them. You call that shining? It's more like greasy. Then buy me one of your liking. Ask the girls who are after you for one. This is for cab fare. See ya~ This never happened, okay? I loathe romance in the workplace. I did my best. I never pressured him! What did I do that was so wrong? No, I was wrong... I love you... I love you! He'll be regretting everything, right? I'm so fucking full! Change this to vodka! I'm going to the bathroom. Hey, didn't I tell you not to take her calls! Hell she showed up at work when I didn't take her calls... Why is that bitch always like that when she's drunk? Great game. Is it fun? I don't get it. Uh? It's you! How nice to see you again... - Uh, yes. Hello. - Yeah. Yeah. - What brings you here? - Me? Me and my friends... Hey! Are you leaving! Traitors. Who me? I went out on a blind date with him. You're hair parting's 7:3 again. Do you know why the lettuce blushed? Because it saw the salad dressing. Then why is a man lost in the desert able to survive? Because of all the sand which (sandwiches) is there... Hey, stay put till I return from the bathroom, okay? Who is she? Where do you live? Where do you live? I... don't have a home. I have nothing. All those lights, but not a single one I can lay myself down... I don't have a light to go back to. Cinderella... had lost her parents while she was still young. And was treated badly by her stepmother and stepsisters. Shaba shaba ai shaba~ how she must have wept~ Shaba shaba ai shaba~ I blacked out. A bad breakup and then a drunken one-night-stand... I've become a typical heroine in a typical screenplay. From this day on, I've decided to start over... ...as a new person. I've let myself go for too long. Rather than wasting my youth with worry, it would be nice and simple to live thoughtlessly. Ah, I'm back KIM Ah-mi, you're not dead yet!! 'The great accountant has invited you into his chat room' - 'How are you? ' - The great accountant? Who r u? - 'OH Seung-won. ' - OH Seung-won? Who is this guy? - 'Your blind date last time... ' - Blind date? 'Don't be embarrassed. Can we meet? ' Meet? What for? - 'I have something to give you. Let's meet. ' - Something for me? What in the hell could that be? What's this about? What do you have for me? First, let me have my tea. You're as aggressive as the other night... If it's about the other night... The other night? You mean us sleeping together? What's your problem?! I'm all yours now. Since you pounced on an innocent man. I'm more naive than you think... What's the big deal when it was just one night of sex? You sure have a loud voice... What's this... A present. Up, it goes up... The lights will be set below this way to hit upward I want it to look like an arch... Hi there. Hi, Kyung-soo. Hello there. So, it's this part. You're early. So you're saying you want to attach a foot light? You must have been on a date. Hey... You got something growing there? So you'll be jumping off this here. - From the top of the shoe? - Yeah. Didn't I warn you not to pull something like this! There's no crime in saying hello. Why are you being so difficult? Wow, you look even more beautiful when you're mad. Anyway, I discovered that women really need to be rich. How can a piece of cloth cost $50? Fifty dollars... Hey, KIM Kang-ae. Are you going to be stitching like that all your life? You're not a widow, you know! Shit, I messed up again. Hey! - Drink this while you're at it. - Thanks. He's nice, cute and even tall. Who would leave him be? Hey, LEE Ho-jae! Come to my place later. No one's home today. Uh, okay. Sorry, but my Ho-jae doesn't like this stuff. He likes hangover recovery drinks! Which reminds me, let's grab some hamburgers for our own hangovers. Now off we go! Director! - Director~ - Yeah, yeah... It's been a year. Your 'one more time' line has led to 17 rewrites! Don't you think you've exploited the situation enough? Yeah, of course I know. You think I'm stupid? But what else can I do? The producer says it's too shitty to pass on to actors. Is that what he's saying? That it's shitty? Not exactly in those words, but... Uh, hi! Why are you always late? You think I've got nothing better to do? Ms. KIM! Just discuss things without me, then go on and write your ass off. Give me a break... Okay then, I'll give you a piece of my mind. I am too embarrassed with this script to pass it on to actors! Oh are you? So what should I do? Should I just quit? You know the famous Minister JEONG? The man who rewrote 100 times to make it right? That's the kind of spirit you need, understand? What's all this mess? I'm doing it! Through loneliness and sadness, I'm gonna write. That's the only way I can save myself!! Hey, that butt's pretty intact!! What is wrong with you? Don't you want to live with us? What's all this? My niece has gone overboard to treat her auntie! Don't flatter yourself. I'm expecting a guest soon, so give me the apartment for a couple of hours. Where am I supposed to go! Don't you have friends? You're life is pretty pathetic. At first, I was so confident. That I'd show the world what I've got. But as each year passes... ...I don't have a clue of what I'm doing anymore... Do I get married? Then I should've become a civil servant... Then quit everything? How can I start over at this age? What can I do? I'll just have to keep on going. I'll make them tremble with a killer screenplay!! What's there to life? It just takes one homerun. You smoke too much. I know... this... I did try to quit... I see you're addicted. Yeah... I am. I have such pathetic will power. That's hard to believe when I haven't been a bit to win you over yet. Yeah... that's true... I'm the kind of girl who's like a rock... I'm not that easy! Cheers! Thanks a lot. Cheers... - You're here. - Yeah. - What, flowers? - Uh... yeah. I guess your mom's still coming home late. Yeah. And your aunt's still smoking, right? That's not good. Everyone's going to be late today. Which means we're the only one's here. Whew, it's hot, isn't it? You wanna play 'Iron Fist? ' I brought it just in case. LEE Ho-jae! Are you a kid? This isn't a game room! I can't believe you're still playing with those things! Kang-ae, I'm sorry. I wasn't aware you hated 'Iron Fist'. Yeah, girls hate these things. I wasn't thinking... sorry... Forget it... I think I'd better be alone. Yeah? Okay. Then call me when you're feeling better. It doesn't matter if it's late. See ya. YOO Mi-ran, you can come out now. Strange! It's works in Brazil. You drive me nuts! I guess cultural differences do exist. Don't worry! One day he'll see you as a woman... ...and eat you up. Come over here, come close. Didn't I tell you before? You have good collarbones... ...so, it's better to push your hair back. And what's with all the buttons fastened? Nice coat of lip gloss. Come here. Mmm, smells good. I see you put on perfume. - Hey, wait... - Uh? I feel nauseous. Did you brush your teeth? Huh? I brushed after dinner. It could be my lotion. Is the smell too strong? Forget it. I'm not up to it today. We'll do this next time. Are you sick? What, are you worried? No, but this is just a precaution. When was your last period? I won't hold you responsible, so don't worry. Asshole... I did say I like it when you're mad, but not all the time. I was just kidding! Menopause? Your period will get more and more irregular and then, BAM! It is closed shut for good. But I'm only in my forties... In certain cases, menopause can come in your late-30s. Some like it coming early as it relieves them of... ...having to deal with the monthly ritual. Then am I through as a woman? Don't worry about it too much. Sometimes it gets better with hormonal treatment. A woman's beauty is not just in the physical... A healthy mind, maturity and experience... Those are what make a person beautiful. From this perspective, your greatest agenda is... I love you, I love you, I love, I love you... I don't believe in love! I don't believe in love! Louder, louder! I love you, I love you, I love, I love you... What? In the name of freedom! Don't you agree it's great? Now I won't be haunted by sleepless nights and cramps. And I won't have to go in and out of the bathroom. Once I had to rush to the men's room. Sis, if you're sad, say so. You seem more pathetic faking it. Sad? Why should I be sad? From now on I'm releasing myself from all womanly bonds... ...and really, truly living as a free being. Then can I call you dad from now on? Wise ass! My only child, but you have to kick me where it hurts, right? Didn't you say you weren't hurting? Come on, not again! You're both wrong, so make up. Didn't you say you were moving out? You said you would emancipate yourself with your breakthrough. Why are you both ganging up on me?! Hey, be quiet over there! You're not the only ones here, you know! Why don't' you leave if you can't stand the noise! You're louder than us! Mind your own business! Hey, they're not worth it. Hey, can't you kick a ball right?! Sorry. Hey, KIM Kang-ae! How can you do that to me? If you needed more practice you could have just said so. Were you so scared of doing it directly with Ho-jae? Did you really need to rehearse? Rehearse? Uh, right! Rehearse. I was worried you might have gotten the wrong idea... Of course not! I got it immediately! Is there another reason to kiss? We're not perverts you know. Perverts... Anyway, thanks! You're a true friend. You're so adorable! Come here, your big sis will give you a hug. Hey, stop it! What's wrong? We've kissed already. Let's rewrite this sucker for the last time. Okay? And where will we get the money to do that? Hi there. You must have been on a blind date. It's so easy for women. If their career crashes, they can just get married. I quit smoking. You should too! What about the conference? What's the use when we don't even have a financier. I'd like to make a proposition. Okay? Let's recall what we started with and try again? How about it? What good would that do? A little change here and there won't fix things. You're always singing, 'a little bit more here, and more there! ' We've got no money to continue. This is why I warned you about rookies. They've got no guts. Is that so? Then I'll remove myself from this project. You two with the guts fight for it till the end! Ms. KIM! Hey, KIM Ah-mi! I can't believe you're being so petty! That's why you never had any success as a writer! What about you? Why haven't you made a film? KIM Ah-mi! What are you doing? I can see you. NA Won-suk, what the hell! Are you here to beg? It's just one mistake, what's the big deal? One mistake? Then count the 100 times we fucked as mistakes as well, you asshole! What! I... went to an audition. I might get a contract if things go well. Are you here to brag? Good for you. I met someone. Our break up has brought me nothing but luck. You've met someone?! Awe shit! I'm out of work! Cheers! What did the strawberry say to the blueberry? I love you berry berry much. Stop~ Tough, isn't it? Life's tough. If anyone told me to go back to my 20s, I'd rather die. Or kill that son-of-a-bitch. But it'll pass eventually. Find every bit of willpower you've got. Stand it, and bear it. That way you'll win in the end. Not everyone can do that. And what's more important is that I am here by your side. Am I making you uncomfortable? 'Son-of-a-bitch' Leave it, it's all... ...over now. Nothing will change. Come back. Even though you can't. Come back. Look at me. As you have always done. The times I've been with you have lost their direction. It's a compass that swings in endless circles. Ah-mi! Ah-mi... I missed you. What the hell are you doing?! Say what you have to say! I left my laptop on. What's the rush? Come here, come here and sit. What time did you start drinking? - They didn't want me. - What? The audition... I'm not their style. Hey, you can always go somewhere else. They're not the only record company around... You... were the only one I loved. Only you... Enjoy the feeling as long as you wish. I'm leaving. Hey, where are you going! Wait... - I have to go! - Wait... Ouch... Hey? Fuck you... Hey, Ah-mi... Hey, you frightened me! It's not the first time my arms were around your waist. People would think I'm pouncing on a virgin. I give up... - Want some help? - Forget it! Whew, it's hot. Stop it! I told you not to be so clingy! Do I look so easy to you? You had your fun, now stop! I'm not your girlfriend! If you're horny, go find a girl your own age! Ramen... let's eat! Come eat. Yes? What brings you all the way over here? Am I not supposed to come here? Want me to go? Wow, I didn't know you were working at such a neat place. I saw these two looking bored. I brought them along to play. You haven't read all these books, have you? Come on, who do you think I am? Of course they're for display. It's impossible to read them all. Humor Encyclopedia... Do you know why the lettuce... Then why is a man lost in... Salad dressing, sandwiches... Is this where you got it? You're in a good mood? Why are you being so nice? Why, you don't like me like this? Should I be mean to you? Okay. I'm playing hooky! Want to go out to eat? Umm... sandwiches? Hey! So you've hit menopause? Menopause... It's no big deal. Is that why you've been so cranky lately? Who told you that? Soo-mi? Why that big mouth... Your heyday is over. Already menopausal at 40. Your joints will fail you ten years before the others your age. You want your friends go-going on the dance floor... while you're busy taking medication for osteoporosis? Why can't you think big? Can't you see it's better focusing on romance... ...while your body can still hold up? Is this how you get girls? I just let out a little steam. Why, were you falling for me? Don't flatter yourself! What's there to fall for? Stop it! I feel great. - Let's go. - Where to? - I'll help you feel. - Forget it. Just feel it! I'm too old for amusement parks. Just feel it. And enjoy. - Relax. - Relax my ass... Open the door to your heart, relax! Didn't I tell you not to be clingy? I hate these things. What's this? It's so pretty. - Who's it for? - Someone. - Who? Tell me. - It's a secret! - Tell me. - I said it's a secret. - Stop asking! - Tell me. - Who's it for? - I said it's a secret. You're awake. Stop being so noisy! You're not the only ones here! What's her problem? Kang-ae? The door's open! Hey! Ah-mi, we need to talk. Are you a psycho? What the hell are you doing?! How can I apologize when you're not taking my calls! Goddamn it, you're driving me crazy! Shit, I hate myself like this. Kang-ae's coming soon. Hurry and say what you have to. You said you met someone... What does the fucker do? What's it to you? It's none of your business. I'm just asking if he's better than me! He has more money than you. Alright. Then I hope you have a happy life.
