The facts reflected in this story take place in Colombia, but it could happen anywhere in the Americas. Hundreds of young people die everyday in the streets of different cities in Latin America, without hope, without the right to a future. This film is a testament to a reality and at the same time a warning. Our youth are the future ... it is our duty to watch over them! This film was partially funded by FONCINE, the Film Development Fund of Venezuela SICARIO (based on true events) Catch him! Catch him! That's what you get for being a thief!

Good evening. Something for the virgin mother. Is my mother there? She must be, but hurry, the boss isn't there. Hey, go through the back. When are you going to change with me? We've been like this for more than a year. I don't want a man that my kid's won't want in the house. But two salaries do more than one. I'm not the kind of woman that seeks a man for help. Men always abandon you with another child to feed. But I'm not going to abandon you. That's what all men say. Why aren't you home? Are you hungry? You know that I don't like you to come here. Come, sit down... Get him our of here, he can take the food if he wants. Go, Jairo. It's getting late. All I want is to live to be 25, then I don't care if I die. Don't you know that you have to steal to live? The thing is to leave your family with money The thing is to leave your family with money before you die. before you die. The worst thing is to goto some jail and rot. But if somebody hires me to kill, I'll do it for the money. Hey, Jairo, come over here. Have a puff. - No, I don't like it. How do you know if you haven't tried it! Come on, do it! What are you afraid of? Your mother? Aurelio, leave him alone. Go away, Jairo. Hey, what's wrong? Come in, but quietly. - Ok, ok. I'm sorry. Give me that. The shoes, the shoes. It's the first time that one of my kids sees me with another man. There's always a first time, it had to happen some day. I can't continue to live for the job. I get tired. I'm tired. What I need is someone that loves me. And that will help me with my boys. What's the matter, Jairo? Your mother just went by. Wait, not like that. Someone is coming. Are you going to rob me? Come on, do it! Kill Him! - Come on, come on! Kill him! Do it! Kill him now, man! Hurry up man, hurry! Hurry up! This is Juana Gallo Come, my love. Come. This isn't going to hurt. So don't be afraid. Come. Come on... Get all your clothes off. I have deflowered several generations. Generals... Drug dealers... U.S. Marines... They even brought me a 60 year old bishop once. Jairo! Jairo! - What's the matter? - What is this? - That's not mine. - That's a lie, Jairo. Where did you go last night? - Stop hitting me! Let go! - What were you doing? Tell me! Who were you with? - Nobody mother, no one! Liar! Whose blood is this? Whose? Whose? So! now you're going to kill me? You're a bitch! Respect me! Respect me! - You're a bitch! A bitch! I'm a man now, a man! A man! It's these two. Ok? Can you wait for me outside? What's the matter? Nothing. I'll be outside. - Rosa! - Please, give number three. - It's ready. Who gave you that money? Don't ask. Jairo. Do you love me, Rosa? What happened, Jairo? Just tell me if you love me. No matter what happens... Will you still love me? But what's going to become of us? When are we going to make love? Not that, Jairo. Respect me. Let's go, it's getting late. Move! Move! Move it! Move it! Go, go, go, go! Move it! Move it! Those kids were the terror of this neighborhood. I hope they kill them. Aren't you going to eat? Aren't you? - Leave him alone! He doesn't know anything. - He doesn't know? He does, he wan'this mother's milk. Angel Chavez was killed. He was accused for the murder... of Supreme Court judge Cesar Cardoba. According to police information, the 13 year old "Sicario..." was hired by members of the drug cartel... to prevent the victim from sentencing against a group... of drug dealers. Do you think Colombia will classify for the World Cup? Higuita will stop all of Maradona's goals. He's Colombian and he's the best goal-keeper in the world. I'm afraid when he leaves the goal alone and starts playing in the middle of field. He does that because he's real good. Someday I'll be like Rene Higuita. Then we'll move away from here. To be like Higuita, you have to be lucky. Hihuita's better than Pele, isn't he Jairo? Of course. And you'll be the best of all. When I get rich. I'll buy you a ball. Jairo, my son. Calm down. Here! Here! - The ball! Pass me the ball! The police! Run! Get him up here! Up against the wall! - We have to get out of here. - What happened? - Pantera squealed. - No, he coudn't have. Orestes got killed. His mother went to get his body. They said he tried to escape. Jairo! Hurry up! He's not here. Where did he go? I don't know, he went to play a while ago. Where are you going? - I'm going with you. - No, you're not, you're staying! - Let me go! - No... I have to hide. You're the man of the house now. - I'll be back. - Jairo! Hurry up! Where's Chabela? I don't know, brother, she must be upstairs. He must be as restless, as the water in the seas. Let him run and without help. Don't allow him to gaze at any woman. Married, widowed or single. May he always think of me. Why the hell can't you knock before you come in? Now the spirit has left me. What? Are you going to tie me down with witchcraft? What do you wan't? What are you waiting for? Well, the party's over. Come with me boy. No, he's mine. - No, I saw him first. Leave hime alone. - Come with me. Leave him alone! That's just what you needed, to become a fag. - Who's he? - He'll stay here for a few days. - So he's in trouble, right? - Yeah. If anything happens, you've never seen me before. - I'll be back tonight. - Where are you going? Take it easy. Chabela will take care of everything. Well, aren't you going to take a bath? You smell like an ape. Are you sure he won't chicken out? He's already killed once. It's like losing the virginity. After the first time, the rest is easy. This is not a game, you know. We have a little job to do. - Can he drive a motorcycle? - No... But that's my part, or are you getting me out of it? Two is one too many. He'll do the killing and then he'll vanish. I'll take care of that. If he's any good, we can use him for another job. Don't worry, I'll get you someone else. Here he comes now. Here he is. Sit down. Meet my friend. I'll be right back. Pilatos. Sit down. - Do you want a drink? - No, I don't like it. Then we started off right. What do you like best? Marijuana or bazooko? What do you want from me? I know that you killed a man. Police. But... Don't be afraid, nothing is going to happen to you. We need you for a little job. If you've done it once... You can kill another. But it wasn't on purpose. I don't want to do it. That doesn't matter. First... A few years in the minor'sward until you're 18. And then, about 25 years in jail. What do you prefer? Besides... We'll be paying you half a million pesos. Doesn't your family need it? Who do I have to kill? First, anyone you want. It's a test. If everything works out all right... If you're true, if you don't miss... Then we'll pay you three million pesos. But you'll have to earn it. What if I fail? You won't fail. I'm sure of it. When do I have to do it? This same night. Here, after you've used it, give it back to me. Just two? Next time it'll be just one. Shoot him at point blank. It's riskier but it's the only way you won't miss. And the money? - Here. That's half, up front. You'll get the rest afterwards. You laid a trap for me back home, right? Why did you choose me? The less you know, the better it is for you. No quastions asked in this business. I don't even know who gives the orders. I don't care. I just want to get paid. Do you know who you are going to kill? Yes... You! Sir, please give me a peso. Buy your scapulary, so God can eliminate all evil thoughts. Be lucky in life, with the scapulary. 30 pesos. Also, put them on your feet. So God will take you along the good path. Where have you been, son? Around. - Did you eat? - Yeah. Jairo, where have you been? I'll be outside waiting for you. If you want you can come with us, Jairo. Don't worry. Are you going to start living with that man? Come with me. The police came to the house. Yes, I know. But they won't come anymore. Take this. I'll have more. I'll get you out of that slum, and put you in a real house. So you won't seek a father for me in the streets. - Son I... - Don't say anything to me. All that matters now is Anibal... The little kids and you. Son... He's taking too long. Do you think he had some kind of trouble? I don't think so. That little son of a bitch has it with him. Well, I don't trust him. Why not? I don't know. It's just a hunch. It's done. Here, have a drink. - Sit down. Don't worry. When I told you I was a cop, well, it wasn't true. Don't be afraid, nobody is going to come after you. We'll take care of that. The next job is more difficult. There are more risks, How much will you pay me? Three million pesos. You can't talk to anyone, not even your mother. Because I won't be responsible. If you talk, your family will also pay. - Excuse me. - Yes? Could I go outside for a moment? Sure, go. Where have you been? Come, let's go. What's the matter with you, Jairo? - Come, let's go. - But where? Let's go to Cartagena. It's just for a few days. Just you and me. Don't say no, Rosa. I need you. Even if it's only once. Let's go. - You ask for the room. - But you're the man. They won't give it to me for my age. You don't look as young as me. - Can I help you? - A room, please. Single, or couple? - Couple. - Your IDs, please. I'm sorry, we don't take minors. Welcome. Look how beautiful it is. Yes, it's beautiful. What's wrong? Why did you say," Even of it's only once?" What did you do? Tell me the truth. There's nothing wrong. Don't ask me any more questions. What will you tell your parents if they ask where you've been? They only care that I bring home a salary. On the ground! On the ground! - Do you want a drink? - Come on, drink something. Do you live around here? - Who is it? - Me, Jairo. Well man, come in or get out. Don't yell at him faggot! I'm the boss around here! His name is Jairo. - Is he coming with us? - Yes. Take it easy, someone took his girl. And he wants to get even with blood. Let's go. You bitch! Let's go. I don't like those kids. They think they're the greatest. All they want is to have fun. They're nobody. They'll never make contact with the office. All they want is to see blood. What about you? I'll kill anyone for money. I still have feelings left. I left my feelings in jail. I paid for a year. I was a good guy. When I get out, nobody helped me. I got out bad and full of hate. Jail is the worst thing that can happen to a man. That's why every time I kill... It's like I was being paid back for what I suffered in that hell. My mother died while I was in jail. I hate this city. I wish I could burn it. Colombia classified for the World Cup. That's our man. - Which one? - The one in the grey suit. Does he always have his guards? - Always. - But, they'll kill me. You have to shoot him at point blank range. - And it I don't do it? - Worse for you. You've already collected half your pay. What do you have down here? Hey, don't touch! Okay. Okay. Okay... Aurelio. Hey, Aurelio, where have you been? Sit down. Bring me another round. HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY Leave it there, brother. - I hope you enjoy it. - Thank you. Happy Mother's Day. How are you, Carlota? Bad... You raise your kids and they end up lost in the streets. Look at me, Jairo! Look at me! Do you know for whom I am mourning? Damn scorpion! Tell me! Did I raise you with hate? Tell me! No, right? I almost died giving birth to you! And this is the way you pay me? - But mom... - But mom nothing! Mom nothing! I don't have a mother's day so take away your gifts! All I have is disgrace because of you! Because of you, Jairo! Because of you Anibal is also lost! He's drugging himself, Jairo! Listen to me, Jairo, he doesn'tgo to school, he doesn't! He comes home with stolen money, with stolen money! Jairo, listen to me... Why did you drop out of school? I got tired of it. I'll never be somebody that way. Didn't you want to be like Rene Higuita? Here, it's everything you asked me. It's all yours. I don't want it anymore. Where did you get that money? That doesn't matter, I told you I would bring it to you, that's all. I kept my word. But you came too late. I don't care to play soccer anymore. All I want is money. I want to be like the drug lords. Brace and rich. I can kill anyone for the money. Don't hit me, you're not my father. Let him go, Jairo! Let him go! Jairo, let him go! That's just what you needed. That you hate each other. Beer for everyone! I'll pay! This is Mother's Day! There is only one mother! Any son of a bitch can be a father Jairo. Jairo! Let me sleep! It's time! Give me a cigarette. Are they going to kill me? After this one you'll get another job. That's not true. The job is not to kill. The job is to die. And you can only die once. But the pay you well. Can you tell me if this document is correct? Yes. It's correct. - Is the car waiting outside? - Yes. Very good. Is everything under control? - Yes. - Okay. Very well. We have to arrive on time. Stay here. Give me your gun. - What's the matter, Jairo? - Get off. Get off fag! What, are you going to kill me? Where you going to kill me asshole? Yes... that was the deal. After you got rid of the client, I would have gotten rid of you. - Who asked for it? - Pilatos. You're the one that betrayed Pantera and Orestas. - So what? - You're an asshole. Yeah. I'm a rat. Those shots are going to hurt me less than life. You won. Shoot. If you won't kill me, they will. Come on! Come on, kill me! Fucking prick. This morning, the President of the Supreme Court, Dr. Raimundo Calcedo was murdered by a "Sicario." The police have attributed this crime to the Medellin Cartel. The keys please. In an attempt to stop the extradition of the drug lords to the United States. With this death, it makes 108 magistrates killed by the Cartel. The police are now investigating... That guy made a fortune. This place is going to be searched. Let's get out of here. What's wrong? Nothing. Here. Let's go! Let's Go! Up against the wall! Up against the wall! Up against the wall! Don't move! Don't move! Up against the wall! Do it! Get going! Against the wall! - Hey man, give me a cigarette. - They're 30 pesos each. No more cigarettes. Take off your shoes. Take them off! Don't be a bitch! If you give them to him I'll fuck you up. Are you brave? What's wrong? Jairo Mejia! Come with me. Come in. Excuse me. Come in. Sit down. Do you want anything to drink? Why did you call me? You were lucky. If that gun falls in other hands... Nobody would 've saved you. - You wouldn't either. - Yes, I know. Any day, a kid could kill me. Or someone else, but that's not important. Look... All young people like yourself are rotten. You want an easy living and money at any cost. But in the end... You all end up the same. I'm not like that. If they don't hey paid, they don't play. Don't invent heroes, kid. The only truth is that you kill for money. You take money too. If I don't do it, then someone else will. The Cartel is the boss here. They're the ones that will get you out of here. When? I don't know. Look... As far as I'm concerned, this doesn't exist. You're a minor. You'll be out of here fast. Can i ask you a favor? All right then... Now get out of here. What's wrong with you? You're a coward. I'll live to be an old man. You'll get killed like a dog any day. Now get out of here. - How is it? - Fine. - Real good, right? - Yeah. Did you take any? Yeah. Where are the dice? Here kid. I don't want any. Take it boy! You're brave. Come on. It will make you fly. So kid... Are you flying already? What's the matter? Stay still man. Stay still. What's the matter with you? I only want to fuck you. - I want to do it! - No! No! What's the matter? Nothing. Why didn't my mom come? She had some trouble with Anibal. He got himself in a fight that almost killed him. I don't want you to comeback anymore, Rosa. But why? I think they'll let me go any time now. What are they accusing you of, Jairo? Nothing. It's a mess at the neighborhood. The shoemaker that got killed. You know that I had nothing to do with that. Yes, I know. Get out of the way! That's it, I told you kid, that game is already won. Gentlemen, there's nothing left here. It's over. I'll leave you here with that dead rooster. God damn! You son of a bitch! You're killing me! Goooalllll! Turn off that T.V. right now! Turn it off. Now, move it! Move it! Not you Jairo.

Hello Jairo. Hop on. I'm not armed. Get on. Who sent you? Hop on. Leave me alone with Jairo. I'll speak with you later. Do you like that type of music? No. You kids only like that American shit. That's why America always fucks us. You have to love what you've got. Defend it. What you did to Aurelio was very good. We want nothing to do with gangs here. What we want here are soldiers. And we're willing to train you, if you are willing. What do I have to do? Be the best. Whoever wins, gets the job. How much are you going to pay me? 8 million pesos. What do you think? Come in. That's him? Let me go, you son of a bitch! That's it! Good. Like a rabid dog. While you're here, you have to pay respect and obey. Klaus will train you. He'll do. Come with me. Jairo. Come here. Look... I started just like you. Without money, and full of hate. And that's good. Because while you have hate, you'll live. Go on, get out of here. A good race can come out of you Colombians. If it can be done with cows and goats... It can be done The bad thing is this damned heat. And those mosquitos... They make you want to die. Klaus is here. - Do it it's your turn. - Do it bitch! Hey!

I wonder who the target is? It's 8 million pesos. - Maybe it's a Bishop? - Or a president. - If I get it... It'll be number 27. I'll bet you have to let them kill you. So what?

If you can't do 100 meters in 10 seconds... You'll get killed you hear? You'll get killed! Move it! Jairo, how are you doing? Klaus tells me you're really good. Do you like it? His name is Zapata. Like Emiliano Zapata. He's beautiful. He's worth a lot of money. Would you like to have one? Yeah, but I don't have the money. Earn it. Everything I did in my life was to have a horse like this. The world is yours if you want it. You''ll see that people who talk about honesty, live in mansions. It's very easy to live that way. What's hard, is to live in misery. To conform, is the worst way to die, don't you think so? Hurry up! Lets go. Come on, come on. Quiet fool! Hurry up! Take your coffee. Thanks. Yes goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Don't shoot! You! Get down from there! We'll take care of that tomorrow. Don't worry, they won't talk. Move it! Move it! Tomorrow you'll do 500 laps! You're mad because we tied the game. Shut your mouth! Germany will win this World Cup. Because we're the best. Who said Indians could play soccer? Higuita stopped two of your goals. Higuita? Higuita is just a monkey! - Black like you. - What's the matter? - Colombia tied with Germany. - One to one. We tied the game, you lost the bet, Klaus pay up! Enough! Here's your money. I lost, so what? Cameroon will eat you alive! Because those negroes are African. Not like you! Tomorrow you'll give me 500 laps! 500 laps! Faggots! Son of a bitch! Come.

That's it kid! Very good! Well, we're finished for the day. Pick up everything. Tell Klaus... I'll be waiting for him in my office. You know the rest. Jairo... Come with me. Jairo. I've made up my mind. The job is yours. Get in. No! You assholes! Son of a bitch! Take it easy kid! Tiger is the best motorcycle driver in Colombia. If he hadn't been born in the slums He would've been world champion. He'll be your partner. You'll see. - Has Penguin arrived? - Yes sir, he's waiting for you. Penguin. This represents you two. These are the two guards. The cars go by slowly. When the first one goes by, you'll go out immediately... through the left side, and then you'll start shooting. And then you'll flee. I won't be able to see him from that side. He always sits on the left side. Who is the guy? When are we doing it? Saturday. At 10 in the morning. At the corner of 7th and 26th street. But that's at the same time as the Colombia-Cameroon game. Precisely. The streets will be empty. Everybody is home. This will be our best chance. When do we get paid? Right now. 8 million pesos for each one. You can count it if you want. It's all there. - And if we fail? - No... You can't fail. It's not for money, it's for your life. Let's go. That guy is as good as dead. Jairo. If you come back... The horse is yours. Doing it again? With the face that I have. Son... I thought you were never going to come back. Bless me. God bless you. Where have you been, Jairo? I went to work in Bogota. And what about you? Still the same? Is that asshole still beating you? That's not your problem. Hi Jairo. You must be full of money. Can you give something? Don't give him anything. He's only going to drug himself with that bazooko shit. Of course! I don't bring money home, and I don't do anything. Don't talk to mom that way. We all know what you're doing Jairo. Shut up, Anibal, shut up! No. Mom, no! You already know. I hear you crying every night. But we have to live from something. All I do... I do it for you. Let's go son. If there is anything to forgive, let the Lord forgive you. I don't want to leave Jairo. I want to live. There's no turning back, Tiger. We have to be in Bogota tomorrow. Why did you accept this? I needed the money. I have a wife and kid. After the job, we're getting out. You know that's not true. This job is too big. If we come out alive... They'll hire someone else to get rid of us. Be careful with him. He's no one's friend. He doesn't believe in anybody. I don't believe in a bitch's love, or a cop's friendship. Let's go. Bring me two beers and rum. We'll drink here tonight. - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? Go, go, go, go! What happened back there? I killed Pilatos. Are you crazy? Pilatos belongs to the office! Why did you decide to run for president? Even at the risk of your own life? I decided to become a candidate, with the hope that all Colombians can live in peace. But peace means to end the injustice. As long as the majority live in subhuman conditions... I thought I would never see you again. Let's get out of here. Take the first bust that leaves for Caracas. There's one that leaves at 12:30. Jairo! Don't say anything. If i'm not back by 12:30... Leave without me. I'll catch up with you. My love. It's not much. But it's better than where we live. Yes... This is a house. I think that fixing it a little bit, it'll be okay. Here. THey paid you well, right? We would've never had a house otherwise. A useless sacrifce, Jairo. A house... in exchange for a son. Jairo! I have to go. What are you going to do, Jairo? Jairo, don't go! Don't go Jairo! I don't want the house. Return it. I don't want it. I have to go. Nothing will happen to me. Jairo, I want you alive. Don't do it Jairo! Don't go! Don't go Jairo! Don't go! We still have time. Let's go! We still have time. - How's the game? - We're tied 0 to 0. Not so bad. Rene plays the ball. He loses it!He's going to shoot! Goal! Goal... for Cameroon! Let's go tiger. Here they come. All of Colombia's hopes have vanished with that goal. Rene Higuita's intention was a little too much. Now we only have 10 minutes to score two goals. That's practically impossible. Tiger...I don't want to kill you. Don't make me do it. What's wrong Jairo? Don't do it. I'm going to have a son. I want to live now. Get down. I'm going to have a son, Tiger. Rosa is waiting for me. Run away. I won't do this anymore either. Colombia's hope are vanishing with the clock. This was the best team we've had in years... - Where is the bus to Caracas? - It's leaving right now. Wait, someone is coming. I don't want to return to Medellin. We'll never return. And the referee says that the game is over! Jairo! Jairo... The game is over, Colombia lost, Cameroon won! But we're not going to kill Rene Higuita for that mistake. We should take it easy with Rene Higuita. He did not want to do that play. He went alone to the locker room. He wanted to stop the ball...
