A KONSTANTIN FAM FILM KADDISH - Hello. - Hello. Hi. As usual. Hi! I need your signature here. - Misha! - Huh? Don't you shine that light in my face while I'm on stage! Yep. Leo, I finally talked them into it. Picture this! Three-months tour, 24 cities. Just sign the papers. Leo, please. When? The flight is tomorrow morning, the concert is in the evening. You're out of your mind. We've already got the money. Money is evil. Then raise my salary. Prepare my violin, will you? Please give a warm welcome to… Leonid Stiller! They are all yours! Good evening! My name is Leonid Stiller. Let's warm up a little bit. Raise your left hand, please. I will show you with my body when you clap. Violin, please! What is this, a joke? Meaning what? This is not my violin! It was in your case. Leo! Where is he going? He has three more pieces to play! Leo! Wait! What are you doing, Leo? Enough games, Katya! - Where is my violin? - I don't know. What is this? Your violin. What's going on here? Yes, we're on our way. I'll call you when we're near. Yes, I know. Ok, he's going down. Yes, all right, bye. Why are you taking the second violin? Could you help me? Had enough sleep? Your father called yesterday and this morning. So? This is none of my business but he doesn't sound well. Your father is not well and he cannot get through to you. It's interesting, it's truly a mystery. Leo, are you insane? You can't do this, it's your father. Katya, I'm sorry. Can you take my violin home? I'm not going. Why? What about the contract? Send the money back. Knock-knock! - Wake up, Nadezhda! - Oh, well… - You won't let me sleep! - A present for you, Nadya. I get plenty of these during the day. Have a look at his ID. I see, I don't think he will get even worse. And won't get better either. Sign here. I mean, you can call the US Embassy straight away. Holy crap, he's an American! The last thing I need. Nadya, I guess, you messed up something in your past life. In a word, have a good night. No. Don't you leave him here. What if he kicks the bucket? Let's wait till the guys are back. Nadya, I do believe in you. And we gotta go out there to save the world. - Wait. - Let's go. Here, take it. If the foreigner dies because of you, guys, the third world war will break out. Am I supposed to roll him to ICU by myself? It's gonna be all right, pops. The guys will be back soon, they'll help you. Can you speak Russian? Damn. Let me take your blood pressure. Oh, gosh. Pops. Pops, wait, don't die, I'll help you. I'll call the guys, just wait. Just a minute, wait. I'll be quick. Just breathe, pops. Wait, please. - Leonid Stiller? - Yes, sir. - Welcome. - Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Is it the Bernstein Store? Yes, but we're closed. I found the name in this violin. - Okay. - I'm from Russia, I'm Leonid. A strange story happened to me. Do you have a minute? I'm in a hurry, but I have a minute, just walk with me. Watch your step, please. Careful around, very expensive. You have to understand that luthier won't be here until tomorrow, so I don't know how I can help you, but I… Careful, very expensive right there Excuse me, I'm... Do you know this violin? This is my grandfather's violin. Solomon Bernstein. Do you know him? Have you seen him? No. You don't understand. I haven't slept in a week. My grandfather, Solomon Bernstein, he's almost 90 years old. He's like a hermit, he doesn't leave the house and then just… out of nowhere he's gone. No note, nothing. I’ve been calling everyone: his friends, the hospitals, the police! - What did they say? - Nothing! He bought a ticket to Europe. - To Moscow? - No, Prague. He was born in Bohemia, I figured… I don’t know, he wanted to go visit some childhood places What are you doing? This is my stamp. The swastika? Yeah, what’s wrong with that? I've been working on this violin for six months. I have the right to choose my own stamp. You have one, don't you? All right… - Hello. - Hello. Hi, good boy. - Let's go, Brut. - Have a nice day. Goodbye. Brilliant, Moisha! How do you do this? It sounds way better than before! Yes. 500 marks, David. Only 500 marks. What do you need, dear? I was sent by Mr.Goldsmith. Shlomo! Bring me the strings and rosin from the workshop. - Do you hear me, Shlomo? - Right away. Wait a minute. Shlomo is so slow. David! Please send me a free-ticket for tonight, okay? Here are your strings and rosin. Thank you. Give my regards to Itzhak and tell him that Shlomo Bernstein came to spend his vacation here. He could give a couple of music lessons to his girls. I’ll be sure to tell him. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. What are you staring at? Haven't you finished yet? There's already a customer waiting for this violin. Get back to work! Go to hell, you old fool! But I still have 2 bags of gold left! Nothing can save your lost soul! There's a nice place for you on Satan's pan! Listen, I’m really in a hurry. What’d you wanna do about the violin? It’s yours. So, Shlomo? Did you give her a try? Too bad she's not one of your breed but I wouldn't mind hooking up with her. Don't touch her, you bastard. Got it? Bastard? Well, thank you, Mr.Bernstein. Thank you for reminding me who I am. Kurt! I'm sorry, Kurt. I didn't mean it. Never mind. It's no secret anyway. Irzhi, did you know I am a bastard that slaves away for the Bernsteins who keep me out of charity, allowing me to eat scraps and breathe their precious air? - Please, forgive me. - Nevermind. Forget it! Just tell me why you never mentioned it to your dad. - Mentioned what? - My stamp. Go to hell! You can stamp them with whatever you want. What do I care? You didn't see it. I would never tell father, I promise. Tomasz, what's the matter? Let's go! Boys! Solomon! - Carl! - Kurt. Oh, sure. Kurt! Why are you here? You are supposed to be at the university in Vienna. I'm on vacation. I'll be going back soon. Good. I'm on vacation, too. Tell your father I'll drop by later. - Ok, Leo. - Tomasz, follow me. You know the way. All right, I’m going now. Wait. Would you like to come with me tonight? - Where to? - Hitlerjugend meeting. All of our guys are going to be there and I can talk you up. No, thanks. I must prepare for the competition in Berlin. But thanks! Well, it's always up to you… No, really. Thank you! See you! So your grandfather didn't like to talk about the past? Did he play the violin? He went to a conservatory in Vienna but… he became a violin maker. And no, he didn't... doesn't like to talk about the past. Why not? Probably because his memories of the past are tied with his memories of the Shoah. Excuse me, the Shoah - what does it mean? Shoah is Hebrew for Holocaust. Uh-huh… So he didn't like to talk about the war? I'm sorry, this might not be an appropriate question. Are you Jewish? I'm cosmopolitan. My mother was born in Ukraine and, yes, my father is a Jew. Then you must understand World War II was a tragedy of massive portions for the Jewish people. 6 million people were exterminated simply for the fact that they were Jews. Half of the World Jewry, so no, he didn't like... You know what? More than 20 million people died in the USSR just because they were Soviet citizens. So I think every family is touched by the War. May I have my violin, please? Thank you Wait a second. This was in the violin case, too. Leo Stiller? That's my name. - Your name is Leo Stiller? - Yes. Wait one minute. Wait one minute! Hey, pretty boy! - Careful! - I'm here. - Here! - All right. Shlomo! Shlomo! Jakub, come here! Your shoelaces untied. Be careful not to step on it. - Shlomo! - Come on! Call them! Hurry up, come on. Children! Dining room! It's lunchtime! - Cheers! - Cheers! To a beautiful evening! Talmud is not a cooking book! No need to be so literal. Leo, you should understand this because you're an artist! I'm atheist. There's no way a jew can be an atheist! Bravo! Jakub! Jakub! Watch your step! - Ada? - Yes? Why are the kids still here? They should be in bed. Take them home. The boys are tired… And bring us a bottle of Chateau Margaux, 1900. Ada! Two bottles, please! Well, the second one is on Mr.Bernstein. Ada! Three bottles. All on me. I'll ask Tomasz to drive you, it's raining outside. Thank you, Mr.Stiller, it's not necessary. I'll take the umbrella and walk her. Ester, go home… Moisha… I forgot to tell you… Pour me some wine, Carl. Cheers! What are you looking for? When my grandfather disappeared, I was looking for a note or something that might tell me where he went and in his archives I found a diary and I found this. Look. Leonard Stiller, Leo Stiller, Solomon Bernstein and Kurt... I can't read the last name. You look like him! Trust me, Poland is just the beginning! Beginning of what? Empire either expands and absorbs everything around or perishes, which is not our case. Does it make any difference to us what kind of Caesar rules us? And who needs an old Jew and his violins? As for me, I'm signing a contract and leaving for America. Hold still! And I'm convinced that we belong to the Land of Israel. And I don't want to live in a desert. Leo has already bought tickets to St. Louis Boat. Haven't you, Leo? Yes. But you shouldn't shout about it from the rooftops. Rich people! America, Palestine, St. Louis… And where do I go? With all my violins? Shlomo! Go home! They're looking for you. Kurt, bring me my precious. Friends! Here's my new masterpiece. The Bernstein's Violin. Believe as I say: we are all going to be ashes and dust. And this Little Beauty would sound… through the ages. Let's capture this… historical moment. Ester, help me, darling. - Hold still! As I taught you. - Yes. Hey, Carl! - Play! - I don't know how to… Why, of course! Shlomo! Sorry. Play! Sit down. Ester! Attention… Is there anything else there? No, just some sheet music, more pages from his diary, but no more photographs. Can I take it with me and read it? Why don't I make us some tea? What a shame! Out of tune! Bravo! Well done, Shlomo! Is that it? Playing a violin is a bit more difficult than hitting on maids. It's a pity your mother and I will never see you become a great violinist. I would like to propose a toast to the most wonderful of feeling. To a feeling that… knows no limits, borders or shame. To a breath of fresh air that… lets us soar above the ground and sets a human being free. And… Blessed is that person… Who has but once… experienced it. To love! I'm buying this violin. It's my present to you. My grandfather could've been a great violinist. His hand was damaged in the camp. Can't believe the violin has been marked with the stamp the whole time. I’m sure the sound of the insrtument wasn’t affected by this. You are aware what the symbol represents? It’s just a piece of paper. Just a post stamp. But I’m sure you can make a lot of money with it now. That’s it? No. It means that the story from your grandfather is true. Hurry up! You can't go there! Solomon! Shlomo! Will you hold the baby for a minute? I'll be right back! I need to see Kurt. Kurt! - Have you seen Shlomo? - Leave, Ada! - He forgot his violin. Can you… - Get out of here now! You shouldn’t be here. Please, Kurt, give him his violin. Get lost, I said. Take care of him, Kurt! Ada! Shlomo, I'm here! Shlomo, I'm here. Ada! What is a beauty like you doing out here in the evening? I was saying goodbye to my husband. Oh, I see. Your husband’s a Jew? Soldier! Help this lady! Take her on a train! No, I can’t go! I have a baby! Oh, a baby? Where is your baby? Mommy! My grandfather lived through that and kept it a secret his whole life. Oh, thank god! Music has arrived, at last! Hey, are these the best we have? We've collected the best, Herr Comandant. We'll be receiving new people from Western Europe soon, there must be a lot of musicians. So, play something! Play, Shlomo! Why the old bones has no instrument? Let him dance! To be honest, they all deserve to be hanged, except for the violin player. Get out, now! Get lost! - Herr Commandant, may I speak? - Yes! Let me get the best musicians from all the camps. I have the time and opportunity to do that. We'll get the best band. Do you know anything about music? I used to work at a music shop. I think it’s nonsense! And I think it's a splendid idea. Well done, boy. Way to go. There's something else here about Stiller. After Kristallnacht, it's the Night of Broken Glass in May of 1939 Leo Stiller and his family boarded the St. Louis for America. But that's good then some cousins are running around here in America. Leo... St.Louis... St.Louis - The Voyage of the Damned. So it's not the Titanic, no? The St.Louis is one of the most embarrassing parts of American history. The United States denied entry visas to over 900 Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. They all had to go back to Europe, where they eventually perished in concentration camps It's a nice camp, Leo. You'll like it here. St. Louis… The Americans betrayed you, it's that simple! And I'm your real and true fan, Mr.Stiller! It's a great honor to meet you. Do you have a family? Yes. They all died of typhus. I'm very sorry. So… Here's what I came up with. We need to get the best band of musicians. They will all be Jews, naturally. The war will soon be over, and this project… can save your life. Your life, Leo, and the lives of a handful of other Jewish musicians. Well? What do you say? Thank you, Herr Werghaus… But most of my audience is already dead. You are quite a hero. If I had your willpower, I'd be a Fieldmarshal by now. Kurt! Give me his case file. This is Kurt, my deputy. By the way, he found you and basically dragged you out of hell. You should be thankful to him. Thank you, Carl. Kurt. His name is Kurt. Thank you, Kurt. Is there anything else about Stiller? I'm reading as fast as I can. His handwriting is a mess. Hi, it's me. Call me back, please, I need to talk to you. So... You are a teacher? Yes. I'm getting my history certification this year. In Holocaust studies, actually. - Congratulations. - Thank you You know, I'm a musician My father never wanted me to be like this. What does he do? He is a cardiologist. One of the best surgeons. We have this in common, my parents are doctors, too. They are in Africa right now, treating AIDS. Is your father in Moscow? When I was 10, my parents divorced. And he moved to Israel. By the way… Did you really see how your younger son Jakub died? Let me rephrase that: what would you do if you could keep your son alive? Anything! We must praise Kurt, then. He is a real search hound. He found a boy named… Jakub Stiller. What do I need to do? - Something happened, Leo? - No, everything is alright. I have a question. Do you have any documents left from your parents? Someone from our family may have lived in Europe. In Czech Republic, Prague. You have to know anything about it! You're always like this… Don't you dare to hang up! Is everything alright? Talked to my father for the first time in two years. And he continues to be an egoistical asshole. Leo. You shouldn't say this about your father. His whole life he cares only about himself. My mother worshiped him. And he just left us. Moved to his goddamn Israel To become a guiding light of medicine Always saving someone, someone but not us, not his family I don’t see my parents too often either, but I try to see the other side of the coin and I’m proud of what they do. Your father dedicated his life to his patients, to the people... Listen. My mother was going to die of cancer. He didn’t even come back to say goodbye. But he called me after the funeral to say: Quit your music conservatory and move to Israel and study programming and economics. Or I won’t help you anymore. What did you say? I said: fuck off! What does... What does that mean? Musician was not a profession for him. He said I don’t make enough money. What did you tell him? “Don’t call me again”. I’m sorry. There’s nothing to regret. I finished my conservatory, I’m a star in Russia and make enough money. More than all the musicians in the orchestra make. So actually I’m thankful to my father. His hate made me strong. Leo, I don’t know what to say. You’re a great man for following your dreams. I’m sorry How great it would be, if I had a father or a grandfather who loves me. Can you imagine, can you imagine - Grandpa Stiller. And yours - Grandpa Solomon. We cannot choose a family we born into. But we can choose a family we die in. How do you mean? Doesn’t matter Your grandfather was looking for a name Leo Stiller in the Internet. And he found me. And it’s just a coincidence. No, we don’t know this. There’s so much more to read here My father grew up in an orphanage in Tashkent. This is so far away from Europe. Why didn’t my grandfather contacted you directly? Maybe he wanted me to meet his beautiful granddaughter. Dad, I always knew that you would find me. Of course, Jakub. Dad, I got ill. And now I don't remember a thing. Where's mom? Where's Emil? God took them. When would we meet with them? When the time comes… then we will meet. My name is Leo Stiller. I'm a… I'm a conductor. I can't make you play… but as long as we play… We'll live. That's it? Nothing more? This is the last page. My father's name is Yakov Vasilyevich, so technically my grandfather's name is Vasiliy. They could make it up in the orphanage. We have to find my grandfather. Solomon Bernstein holds all the answers now. Yes. You have to talk to your father again. It's late, I have to go back to the hotel. Why don't you stay here? In the guest room. We can figure out the next step in the morning Thank you. Just right up the stairs. Sleep, my dear little boy Sleep and close your eyes Day is over, light is gone Moon is in the skies Sleep, my child… What are you writing, dad? Kaddish. Is it a song? Yes, a song. And what is it about? This is a song about you… about Emil and mother… about all of us. Rachel? What is the kaddish? Good morning. Well, the kaddish is like a prayer. You say it when someone dies. You say it for those who have passed on, who can no longer say it to God themselves. It helps the spirit rise up, get cleansed, get closer to the God. It's a little more complex than I'm making it seem You can read it in our Siddur, we have one in my grandfather's office on the shelf Hurry up, though, coffee's gonna get cold. And I got some bagels, too. FOR LEO STILLER Go ahead! Quick, quick! Take this away! Dismissed. Put the crates in the truck, quick! He's waiting for you. Come here, quick! Put this in the truck too! The boy stays with me. Close the bolts! Careful with the paintings! Yes, sir! Come on, come on! What are you waiting for? - You wanted to see me? - Yes. I wanted to say goodbye. What will happen to us? I'm no longer your promoter. Are we free? Musicians are always free. What do I tell them? Say thank you. And one more thing… I saw that you were writing something this whole time. What was it? Kaddish. A Kaddish? Then you should play it. To say goodbye. This is my last request. That's where you have the Freedom Tower. See it? Right there. I will go and have some rest. I’ll be right here. I’m gonna take some photos. LEO STILLER IS NAMED AS A BENEFICIARY IN THE WILL OF SOLOMON BERNSTEIN'S. CONTACT ATTORNEY LARRY ZIGELMAN WITH ANY QUESTIONS. Herr Commandant, we're ready to go. Just a minute. I'll warm up the car. Go on. No, no! Please don't kill them! They are only musicians. You’re looking to get out of this clean, huh? That won’t happen. You have to pay the price, Judas. Leave the conductor and the first violin! Don't shoot these two. Leave them out of this. That’s an order. Richard, I’m begging you, leave these two. Richard! Richard! I beg you! Don’t! Don’t kill them! They are simply musicians. Please, don't! I beg you! - The concert is finished. - I don't understand you. It’s your solo. These two are yours. Kill them and we'll go. Shoot them or I'll shoot you. Bravo! Now Stiller. Now! Live on if you can! Hello! I know you're home. Leo, we're beggars! We're broke! Do you hear me? I can't go on like this, I need money to live on. I've found a new job. Ok, do whatever you want, sort it out yourself. I won't come here anymore. Why did you do this to me? Want some? I believe this belongs to you I’m not playing anymore We need to talk seriously. I’m serious. Take your violin and go home. Oh, you mean your violin? Because according to my grandfather’s will, you’re now the solid heritor of this violin, whole collection of instruments, the shop, everything! My family business belongs to you now. So, I’m rich now? American? You’re a wonderful girl and it’d better for the both of us if you leave. I’m not going anywhere, untill you tell me the truth. Not here. Okay. Leo, I have a million questions for you and you haven’t answered one. Why have you brought me out here? What is that? What is it? Leon! Where’d you get this? Leon. But I’m, I’m Jewish. My mother, my father... This is impossible. Leon, say something! I think about my father. He didn’t say anything to anybody. So go to him, talk to him. I... And do what? Clean up our relationship? Sure. Your grandfather killed my whole family. And the likes of him destroyed my people. And our history. They lived at the expense of their victims. Say it in English. Say it. You’re a granddaughter of a Nazi. So put me to death. Hello? Solomon Bernstein? Yes, he’s... He’s my grandfather. Where? I’m in Moscow, but I’m on my way. Thank you. They’ve found him in Auschwitz. He had a heart attack in the museum. He’s in a hospital in Poland, I have to go. I don’t know if I want to make it on time. You’re right. I need to talk to my father. I’ll call you. We have to fill out the paperwork. He’s been waiting for you. You should let him go. Rachel… Rachel… I have to say… I already know everything, grandpa. Your mother… I found the daughter… of Solomon and Ada… after the war… You… You are not my granddaughter… You… You are the granddaughter… of Solomon and Ada… Whole my life I could not What happened to Jakub? - Let's repeat. - I don't want to. Who are your parents? - Who are your parents? - I don't remember. What's your name? I don't remember. I had Jakub sent to the orphanage. He... He was a witness. I'm... I'm in hell.
