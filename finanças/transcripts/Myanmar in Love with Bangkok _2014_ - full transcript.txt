Wounds all over his body. This guy's in bad shape. Hold on. Hold on! Make way please. Nurse, please hurry up. Are you all right? - What a jerk. - Why? What happened? It's Mr Sneed. Oh, he needs you, because you can speak English. Please tell Dr Dachanon that I've already informed Mr Sneed. I'll take this for you. Dr Dachanon, your tea. Just put it on the table. And Mr Sneed has been informed. We have two teams in the final round. Both teams are great fighters. Let's see. This team is led by Asawain, a taekwondo champion. They also have Wisarut, a former national judo athlete. And the other team? This team is a group of Master Udon's students. Master Udon? But he has passed away. Yes, three years ago. But these guys have been trained by him. And this. He is Pod, Master's Udon's son. - His son? - Right. I think we are ready now. Why isn't Mr Sneed here already? You. Go and get him. Well... I can't speak English. You know, there are people who find the way to finish their job. And people who let others work for them. And then people who are just god damn lazy! Using their parents' money for their dream of becoming a star, but they're empty. No talent or even inspiration to do a damn thing. Ready? Ao, don't you remember what Master Udon taught? Fern, come here. Back off, you moron. Let's see. Now kick me. You must do it like this. Then you can use your elbow like this. Idiot. If you did that, you could kill Fern, Pod's niece. Lerm. Would you go back to China for kung fu? No. If my team wins, I won't go back to China. Because we will go to work in Hollywood. Hollywood? Let me go with you. Not so fast. After we win. Promise? - Hey, mum's here. - Hello, Mum. You must be starving. I've brought something to fill you up. Leave some for me. This one's for me. Oh, not this one. This one's for Pom. Pom doesn't like Tuna. Here you are, Pom. Ah, mum. I'm your niece. I'd like to have some tuna today. Go on. Take it. - Just kidding. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - That one's good for you. - I think we've got a chance. - Really? Yeah. Whether win or lose, I'll cook a special dinner for everyone tonight. I'm sorry, mum. If we win today, I'll treat you all a big dinner tonight, so mum can rest. You'll buy us drinks too? Then you'd better bring your daddy's credit card. I'm ready for a drink. Joy can't come today. She hasn't finished her homework. Pod, why don't you eat anything? Mum, I don't want to eat anything right now. I just want to win and get the job. Then I'll have money to take care of you, so you won't have to work so hard. If you father was still alive, he would be very proud of you. I'm sure he would be very proud. Listen now. May I introduce this person to you again. Go get it. He is Dr Dachanon, Head of the Performing Arts Department. I just want to thank you. The winning team will be invited to work with Mr Sneed and myself in Hollywood next month. After a grueling contest, 50 teams are down to the last two. The first team is "Stunt For Life". And the other team is "Fight Club." Here we go! Actually, I like both teams. But there will only be one team that goes to Hollywood. May I have the best person from each team. They will battle each other to decide the winning team. Pod, I think you're the best. - You can do it. - Go get it. Here's the rules. Can you see that box? There's a gold coin inside. Whoever gets it, wins this contest. Go. Go! Pod! Pod! I got the box. I got the coin! I got the coin! The winning team is "Fight Club". Son of a bitch. Respect the rules. Eleven. We must be home by eleven. If not, the General will kill me. - Hey, Joy. - Yeah, it's Joy. Hello. Hello, James. Hello everybody. How are you doing? Joy, you look more gorgeous than when I last saw you. Hello. Buddha bless everyone. How are you? Hello everyone. Oh, Ram. Ram. I'm fine. Be home by eleven? I know. It's nothing. - I'll check the amulet for him. - Amulet checking. Really? - Amulet checking. - Of course. Waiter, make it strong. - How much? - 200. What? For just a short ride? 70. - 70 won't even cover the gasoline. - OK, 200. But take me home too. - That would cost 500. - 500? This is robbery. 300, and take me home. Hey, wait a minute. Good evening, everyone. I'm the musician for this wedding. Are the bride and the groom coming out soon? Where's the stage? What song would you like me to play? What time does the bride and groom cut the cake? You're in the wrong place. This is a celebration party, not a wedding party. Celebration party? Do you happen to know where there might be a wedding party? Oh, my. Oh, dear. Classic! Wrong place! You took me to the wrong place. I have to go to a wedding party. Let's go. I'll be in trouble if I'm late. Again. What's wrong with your motorcycle? - It won't start. - I knew it. I've seen this gag somewhere before. - I don't think I'll make it in time. - I'll hire you. Good manners. Sure. Fake, for sure. Paid good money for it? There. The real one is around Joy's neck. Grand Lumpoon Model. First edition. Have a drink. Sharp taste. Come on. Just a little. I don't like to upset people. - Let's take a group picture. - 1, 2, 3, hey! Hey. Wake up! Wake up, Krit, Lerm. James, wake up. Ko, get up. Wake up. Ah! It's morning! The telephones are all gone. Shit. Joy, what should we do? - I told you not to drink too much. - I didn't. I only had orange juice, but I can't remember anything. Hey, listen. Let's get out of here. Our cars are gone too. - My motorcycle too. - I don't know where your motorcycle is. How would I know? Hey, James. Are you playing a prank on us? Why the hell would I do that? My car is gone too. I bet you'll get a wife tonight. Look over there. Oh, wow. - You like it? - Don't make me puke. You shouldn't. My motorcycle is fixed. You want to go home? You want to go home now? I don't think you can make it back. One more. Hold it like this. Bang. How's that? Shit. Is this what you learned from China? I think you'd better learn Thai dance from my grandma. You want me to show you the real thing? - Again. - Take a good look. - Hold my hand. - What if I do this? What would you do? Are you OK? You OK? You should be more careful next time. We'll have to make new dishes for you. - That's not right. - We're really sorry. Please make sure your kids don't cause trouble again. What's the problem? Don't apologize. You are hired to do whatever I say. If you have to make new dishes, do it, you hear me? Do it. Just do it. What's the problem? We're just doing our job. How about you? What are you doing? Don't you look at me. Son of a bitch, eat this! Those guys from last night, they must have drugged us. Then stole our cars. What a classic situation. After what you did to them, you're lucky they didn't kill you last night. What about my motorcycle? Being a driver is a service job. It's a part of your job. And you even got me lost. - You made we wait. - You made me lost. I think you'd better calm down. It can't be gone. It must be around here. I warned you. Don't bring the company car. - We're in deep shit now. - Why are you blaming me now? You didn't say a word while riding in it. Get away. Get away. - What's happening? - Quick. - Take him to the hospital. - Go sit over there. Has anyone seen Joy? Where's Joy? - She went home? - Where's Joy? Help! - James is nowhere to be found. - Where's Joy? Help! Help! Hey. Joy is in there! - Where are you going? - I'm out of here. I gotta go. I don't want to die! Joy! Joy! Ram. Let's go. - Are you OK, Ram? - I'm OK. One moment. Go. Wait. Wait for me. Can't you stop and talk for a minute? Help! Let me go! Oh, great. I haven't had a chance to talk. So classic. What a day! Let me go. Help! Hold her tight. Go! Pod. Pod! Pod! Help me! Can't you use your brain? You can't just run. We're not in the Olympics. Running is good. So we'll find her. Ram... Joy. Help me! Help me! Shit. What a crappy day. Lost my car. Didn't get paid. How am I going to tell my wife? Hold on! Welcome to my show. Don't be surprised why you got so baffled. Didn't I tell you that you were about to be superstars? I didn't lie. You're the best team. And you're about to find out whether you are true friends. What the hell are you talking about? This is my game. A game without guns. You have to save your friend's life and your own lives. And if anyone dares to get out... What do we have to do? Time. You don't have much time left. Just save your friend's life and your own. Oh, and don't forget to smile at the cameras. Smile. We need this money for my plan. Are you sure your team is ready? For those kids, I alone can take care of them. Ten years ago? Yes. Before this. You have to accept that your best days are behind you. Pom, you go that way. How much is 20,000 dollars in Thai baht? 20,000 dollars? More than half a million baht. Shit. Half a million? Do you see that white guy? - He just bet that amount. - Really? That's good. I hope they are heavy tippers. Ed! Ed, are you OK? I'll be back. Ao, are you OK? Ao! Can you hear me, Ao? - You like it? - What the hell? Pretty boy. But better than that is being single. But I wonder if that... is single. Where's my friend? You should've told me you were a sadist. I like it. Bastard! I love heavy kickers. Ouch! Stop right there. I'm all beat up. Handsome guys can never be trusted. Pod, Joy is over here. I'm going to kill you! Doesn't hurt me. Listen to me for just a moment. Please listen to me. Have you ever used your brain? You only use your muscle. Running all the time... If you don't shut up, I'll kill you. Ram! Don't you think? Hold on. Calm down. What do you want? - Tell me what you want. - Let's talk. Let's talk. - What would you gain from doing this? - Let the woman go. - Then we'll talk. - Women are fragile. What do you think? I don't think he's interested in talking to you. Let's go. - That's enough. - Enough. Don't kill him. We have to ask him where Joy is. Hey, tell me. Talk! Oh! You punched him so much that you messed his face up. He still won't talk. Must be mute. Mute your ass. I'm in pain! When did my ass land on your stomach? Shut up, you buffalo in a suit. Okay, enough. Stop arguing. - Tell me where the girl is. - Tell us. Pod, go rescue Joy. I'll take care of things here. Take her away. You son of a bitch. Backstabber! Bastard! I'm going to kill you! Pom, are you okay? What's happening? Where's James? James? Hey, watch out! Lerm, run away! Ko! - Ko, are you okay? - I'm okay. If we get out of here, they'll shoot us. But if we fight, we might make it. Then we have no choice but to fight. Can you walk? Hey, go. Just shut up. Don't resist me. Hey, how long are we going to keep walking? It's not a marathon. Just shut up already! If you can stop, I will. Ram! Serves you right! Help. Help! Go! - Go, quickly. - Wait. Ow... I can't. That got into my throat, you idiot. Why did you do that? Help! Help me! Help! I can't go any further. That's good. This is the right way to use your brain. Just stay here. They'll come to us. That motorcycle rider. I thought you escaped. I'll pay the fare later. Hey, what's that? Classic, again. Run! I said run! Help! Help me! Joy! Pod! Pod, help me! Joy, don't be afraid. - I'm coming to get you out. - Help me. Hold on tight, Joy. Joy. Don't be scared. - I won't let you get hurt. - Help me. Pom, watch out! Pom! How could you still be betting on Thai people getting hurt? It's their special abilities. When it comes to money, nationality is irrelevant. Money has its own nationality. Money is the only thing I pay respect to. Do you want to pay respect with me? Pod. Pod, help me. If you can't walk, rest here. I'll bring someone to help you. Okay. I'll wait here. Be careful, Fern. Okay. Thanks for carrying me. I'd be in trouble if not for you. I'm worried about Fern. I'd better go and see if she's okay. Let go! Let me go! Pod. Pod, help me. Pod, be careful. - I won't let Pom take you again. - You never understood me, Pom. What are you doing? Bastard. If you were not my friend, I'd have killed you. Oh, I'm so sorry. I can't help! They got the girl. - Which girl? - The girl... Is it Fern? Yes, probably Fern. Pom. - What are you doing to my friend? - Don't do it. Pom! I'll kill you! Pom! - Pom! Can you find him? - No. I can't find him, Ao. - How's Pom? - How about Pom? Where's Pom? - Where's Pom? - Pom was stabbed right here. Hey, let's go rescue Fern. Fern was captured. Ram's injured too. What the hell's wrong with you? Hey, where's Pom and Lerm? Pom is dead. What did you say? - Pom is dead. Can you hear me? - Ao, this isn't funny. Are we all going to die? No. No way. What do they want from us? There's no police around either. Here they go again. When is this going to end? What a day. My legs are about to fall off. Hello? Why don't you let your friends hear it too? You are very good to have got this far. I know you're around here. Just come out. Come out. Come out and see us! Calm down. Just be patient. You'll get your fight. Come out, you sons of bitches! Let's fight like real men do. Come on. Shut up, or I'm going to kill you. Hold on. Calm down. You want to meet your friend? Hey, come out and meet your friends. Hey! James? How could you do this to your friends? Why do you want to kill us? Why did you kill Pom? Why don't you say anything? Give me a good reason. Tell them. Don't let them stand and shout at you. I need money. My dad is going bankrupt. That's your reason? You son of a bitch, James. Calm down. Don't be so quick-tempered! Listen to me. I know you are all heartbroken. But there's something that'll totally crush your heart. Pom? What does this mean? Joy, don't be scared. What does this mean, Pom? It means, you are a bunch of fools. But you didn't disappoint me. You did better than I thought you could. Pom, why did you deceive us? What about you? You deceived me too, you liar. You couldn't choose. So you screwed Pod behind my back! You son of a bitch. I'm not that kind of person. Pom, please stop. I beg you. - Please let us go. - Ah, that can't happen. The story is reaching its climax, you know. - Why do you have to do all this? - Money! Money can buy everything, even friendship. Anger, grudge, bitterness... I love it! I've been listening to you... Do you have to be this cruel? You. And you. Great job! Great job! Super job. Well-played. I'm sorry, but in the end, you get fooled again. Stupid! I'm sorry, but he works for us. And when the game is coming to an end, he deserves to be able to watch the final scene. I'm sorry. It's a job. A well-paid job too. Sorry, guys. Sorry for having to do this. You've all done very well. But now, you must face my guys. There are no rules now. This scene you remember for the rest of your life. A classic comedy scene. Is that the best you can do? Hey, let's show them my masterpieces. - Lerm. - Fern. I'll get paid. You'll get whooped. I prefer cash in dollar bills. What if we could do it? What if we won? I'd pay the people who bet on you, and you'd play on. Oh, I almost forget. Mum! Pod. Wait. When our actors are getting weak, we usually find them a little inspiration. Take this as a surprise. You will not die well, you bastard! Calm down. Your mother is still alive. If you want your mother and brother back, don't mess up your chances. You'll have to beat everyone. Or these two hostages will forfeit their lives. I'll beat whoever you send. Whoever! Come out if you dare. I didn't mean whoever. I meant everyone! Your dad must be Michael Schumacher. What a driver! Pom. - You don't look so pretty now. - Pom, please, don't. I beg you. It's none of your business. Taking it for the girl? I won't disappoint you. See? Your love won't help you. A person like you doesn't know love. It seems they are better than your team. I thought I'd trained them better than this. But I told you everyone. That includes me. I told you I alone could take care of all of them. Now it's time to show you I wasn't kidding. Pod! Game over. I'll take my money now. Whoa! Where did you come from? Sompong! You like to see people in pain? Cruelty. That's your pleasure, huh? - You like it? - Not anymore. You want to be rich? Other people's lives are worthless? You fat pig. Psycho. I have to rescue Pod's mum. Close the door! They followed us here. Tell everyone to stop them. Don't let the rest through. Jump from here. Are you sure, Ao? It's high. It's the fastest route. Jump together then we split. On the count of three. One. Two. Three! Damn it. Why didn't you jump? Ao. Let's go! Go! You're such a bastard like your father. I'm my mother's son too, and I'm taking her back. Bastard. - Where are you keeping my brother? - I don't know. Pod? Lerm! - Brother! - Lerm. Are you all right? Not me. Not me. It's him. He's killed many people. Arrest him. My mother's in the truck. Stay here. Ambulance and back-up are on the way. Arrest him! Mum! Pod? Pod! - Are you okay, Mum? - I'm okay. I'm not hurt. - How about you, Pod? - I love you, Mum. Does it hurt? One, two, three, hey!
