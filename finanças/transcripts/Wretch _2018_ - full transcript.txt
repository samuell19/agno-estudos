Come on, give us a good show, kiss her, kiss her, kiss her, kiss her, kiss her, kiss her, yeah. - That what you wanted, baby? - I'm not sure it was in focus, how about you do it again but this time, lose the shirts. - Later honey, for your eyes only. - What these girls do to me is criminal. You seeing this shit? - Unfortunately. - Jesus Riker, lighten up, it's a fucking party, what's your problem? - Problem, let's see, I'm broke as fuck, I hate everyone including myself and I'm an angry drunk. - Hey, got you a present. - Thanks babe. I'm getting sleepy. Don't you think it's time for us to go to bed? - Oof yes. - Enjoying the show? So are they an item? Ya know, like officially? - Yeah, for the past six months. - Is there any wiggle room there? - Why? - I'm just curious. - Not that I know of. - So how do you know Caleb? - Grade school. - You guys close? - Wouldn't go as far as that. - Oh come on, gimme more than that, what's the deal? - There's no deal. He's just kind of an ass-hat. - This is his camera. You know he's gonna see this shit, right? - He knows that he's a fucking ass-hat. - Then why are you friends? - Habit. - Well, I like him, plus he's got a nice ass. - Yes, one mustn't neglect the little things in life. - This guy bothering you? - Jesus Caleb, that was fast. - What happened to little miss drunky-no-pants? - Head hit the pillow, she zonked the fuck out. Looks like I'm flying solo tonight. - That's disappointing, I would have thought you woulda went for it anyway. It's kinda your style. - Don't be a dick. - You're a fucking piece of shit Caleb. - Hey, wake up sleepy tits. Come on babe, it's almost three. - God damn it, really? - Yeah, and we're out of food. - Then go to the fucking grocery. - Come on, we're out of money too. - That's your department. I'm just supposed to look pretty. - I'll have cash on Tuesday. We'll put it on the card. How you feeling? - Like I got run over by a fucking truck. Did I make out with Cara last night? - Affirmative. - Fuck! She still here? - No, I think she snuck out this morning. - Good. Did you enjoy the show at least? - Give it three stars. - How 'bout now? - Three and a half. You know this is going all over the internet, right? - Don't joke about that. - Not joking, how could I deprive the world of those? - You really like the idea of other guys looking at me? - Only with your permission. - Mmmhmm. - What'dya say? Do you hearby grant to me, your boyfriend, the right in perpetuity throughout the world and all media now or hereafter known. - Stop it. - No no, this needs to be official. The right to use images of my supremely hot bod and super duper sexy voice, so help me god? - Maybe. - Sorry, but I'm gonna need a yes or no. Think of it like a trust exercise. - Whatever you want, dear. - So that's a yes? - Sure. - You fucking slut. - Shut up! Do you still respect me? - I'm gonna go with yes. - Good. Then put down the camera and get me some breakfast. - Well hello there internet, I didn't see you come in. Have you met my lovely, wonderful insanely fuckable girl friend, Abby? She doesn't visit my channel very often, but when she does, woo! It's like fireworks if you know what I mean. Ah shit. - Which one? - I thought we were just getting essentials. - We are. - Both. - That Cara? - No it's Riker, he says sorry for being a raging douche. And he wants us to come out to Blackwood tonight. - S'mores in the forest? - Something strong, he says the shit came in. - Oh, I'm still getting stuff for s'mores. - Look, I'm not giving you shit, I just wanna know if you got to bludgeon the flaps a little bit. - You are beyond disgusting. - Oh what, come on! You get to hear every detail about my sex life. - Hey! - Yeah, because you won't fucking shut up about it. - All right listen, I'm with Caleb on this one. - What? - Bros before hoes. Know what I'm saying. - Damn, you just set the women's lib movement back maybe 60 years. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Women's lib? Excuse me, is this 1968? Are you an English professor at fucking Dartmouth? - You know what? You guys want equal rights? You get to carry the 50 pounds of shit you made me bring. - Uh, which I paid for. - Until Tuesday. - Look pussies, it's not that heavy, and it's not that fucking far. - What are you talking about? - It's just over the hill - Yeah, like a mile and a half. - Unless we cut across the railroad tracks. - What, through Shanty Town? - Yeah. - What babe, ya scared? - Of homeless people? They're terrifying. - What? Oh my god. - You never had a weird experience with a homeless dude? - No, they ask me for change, I tell 'em no and leave. - No seriously? - Exactly. - They're all fucking crazy. - Oh come on! - They're not all crazy. - It's terrifying. - Let's go. - All right Riker lead the way. - All right. - You know what they say, early bird gets the worm, second bird doesn't get stabbed by a homeless dude. Come on, let's see it. - All right Jesus, hold your fucking horses. Tah dah. - So beautiful. - Now, before we get into this, - Awww. - Ohhh. - Look, I'm trying to make a point here. I wanna say I'm sorry for being an angry uberfucking drunk douche at the party. And I care about you guys and value your friendship and love you all and some emotional shit like that. - Awww. - So sweet, open the fucking bag. - How much of that are we supposed to smoke? - Like two, three puffs, tops. - I ain't no fucking bitch, Riker. - I know you ain't no fucking bitch. - Yeah, don't skimp on it, I don't wanna repeat of the mushroom debacle. - Oh this is way stronger, trust me. - How the fuck do you know? - Came out here a couple days ago and I tried it. Trust me, three puffs is all you fucking need. - Wait a second, wait a second, you're saying you came out here all by yourself to try something brand new, on your own, without me. - Yep. - Awww, Riker, - Bastard. - I thought tonight was gonna be the first time for both of us. But you had to go and pop your cherry. - I just had to make sure it was safe for the mere mortal in our presence. Your turn. - Shit, slow down, won't ya? - Pipe down, you'll get your fucking turn. - Oh not a good flavor, gotta be honest. - You've sucked worse. - Yeah ya have. Yes, chasers are definitely a must. - All right, go ahead and spike it. - All right, if you say so. - What is that shit? - A hallucinogenic herb of the something fucking plant. I don't know, Indians used to smoke it to see God or the devil or purple trees or some shit. - It's Native Americans you prick. - Yeah purple tries do exist. - Well, tonight, this is our peace pipe. Come on, you're turn. - All right, all right. - Here we go, baby's first hit. - Asshole. - See? - Yeah you're gonna wanna take a drink. Here's to one fucked up night in the woods. - Woo! - Did you see it? Can you see? - Abby? Everything okay? - Yeah, why? - You and Riker were having a pretty serious talk back there. - He's just having some problems at home. - How would you like to be married to a dame like, - Really? - I'm turning it off. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey shh, shh, calm down. It's all right, it was a dream. It was just a dream, okay? It's all right. It's all right, it's all right. Just breathe. Shhhh. Okay. - I'm telling you, this was different. - Different how? - Can you just trust me? - Like every other time to me. - It was different, where the hell are the keys? - How was it different? - Caleb you're gonna make me late. - Did you check on top of the fridge? - Thank you. - Different how? - You know the shadow guy at the foot of the bed? He wasn't in this one. I wasn't even at home. I was back in the woods and there was something with me. - What did it look like? - I don't remember. - What were you and Riker talking about? - Jesus, Caleb, now? Look, I don't even remember what he was saying. I think he was still drunk or tripping or something. Something about his mom being depressed and his sister is freaking out again. You know, typical Riker soap opera bullshit. I'm sorry I made you jealous. - It happens. - Say you're okay. - I'm okay. - Good, your insecurities are making me late. I will call if rehearsal lets out early. - Looks like someone can't handle his hard core hallucinogens. It's just you and me now babe. - How scandalous. - So you wanna ditch this loser or what? - Mom always told me avoid randy men with video cameras. - You really are gorgeous. - Thanks. Put the camera down now. - Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. - You didn't upset me. I'm used to all kinds of compliments. Fuckable, hot, gorgeous is just a new one. You caught me off guard is all. You think he's really out? - God, I hope so. - Don't be a dick. - Sorry, it's just that being around him all the time can get really-- - Exhausting? - Yes. I love you. - What? - I love you. - Is that the drugs talking? - Yeah. Wanna go for a walk? - Promise to be a gentleman? - I don't even know what the fuck that means anymore. - What do you want? - We need to talk about Abby. - Gimme a minute. - She hasn't slept much. She'll wake up screaming. I thought it was just like an attention thing. You know how Abby is. - Don't say that. - Sorry, just don't really know what to do. - Fuck man, what do you want from me? You and Abby disappear off the face of the earth for a fucking month, she won't respond to any of my texts. - She thinks you had something to do with it. - Do with what? - The dream. - What dream? - Just go talk to her. Tell her to go see someone, maybe it'll help. - Yeah, okay. - You're not gonna say anything? - Why did you bring him here? - Great point. She's being a complete cunt. - She doesn't have a good reason? 147 text messages, does that ring a bell? Just go in there and listen to what she has to say, okay? - Fine. - Tell 'im, come on. You told me a thousand times already. Starts, you're alone in the woods then, - I'm moving forward down a path. There's a light, but I can't see past the light. And there's a symbol that keeps flashing in my head. It's a spiral with a line through it. And I'm getting close to something big. It's a shadow and I can't quite make it out at first. But then I see it. It's about eight feet tall and its skin is, - Red and black, like rotted meat. - And its eyes are, - Red. Call me when you really wanna talk. - Tell me what it is. - I'm not sure yet. Do you remember the night in the woods? You saw something that night. - We were stoned. - What's your fucking point, Abby? That it didn't happen? That it isn't happening? You have to face reality. - I can't handle this on my own. I need your help. - All right fine. Look, do me a favor, don't tell Caleb we talked, all right? - Okay. - You're going all out tonight, huh? - Figured you were tired of the sweatpants and T-shirt routine. Just wanted to look nice for once. - Feel better? - Do you think I'm pretty? - You have to ask? You know, we don't have to go out tonight, if you don't want to. There's plenty we could do right here. - I'll tell you what. Why don't we pop open that bottle of wine and see what happens. - Anything you want, babe. Anything at all. - Abby, hey hey, hey hey hey shh, shh, it's just a dream. It's just me, it's okay shhh. Shhh, shhh It was another dream, it's okay. Shhh. - Are you sure it wasn't another dream? - No. - Tell me. - Tell you what, Riker? You know exactly what I'm talking about. - Do you remember what happened in the woods? - I told you we are not gonna talk about that. - I missed you. I've missed both of you, I mean. I didn't mean for things to happen like that. I just wanted to talk to you. Wasn't it nice being able to actually talk without Caleb interrupting every two-- - You are unbelievable, Riker. - I take that as a compliment. - Is your dream the same as mine? - I don't wanna answer that. - Why? - I don't wanna scare you. - I'm already scared. - Me too. So what do we do? - I was about to ask you the same thing. Do you ever think that by obsessing over this thing we're just making things worse? - Worse how? - I don't know, fixating on it, thinking about it all the time just makes it a bigger deal than it is. - It's already a pretty big fucking deal. - I just mean that if you talk about something all the time you give it power over you. - So you're saying that if we just don't talk about it. - Talk about, think, debate, anything. - That it'll just go away? - Maybe. - That's a super healthy way to deal with your problems, Abs. - Do you have any better ideas? - I went back into the woods. - What? When? - Night before last. - What did you find? Riker. What did you find in the woods? - I don't remember. - What do you mean? - I went into the woods, and I came back out covered in mud, scared half to death. By the time I got home, I couldn't remember anything. Like a bad dream. - So you don't remember your dreams? - You know that I do. - Are they the same as mine? - They are, but one thing's different. - Which is? - I'm the monster in the woods. - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Answer the question Riker, were you in our fucking house? - Caleb, you need to calm down. - I'll calm down when you answer my fucking questions. You're filling her head with all this bullshit and now, - You know what, fuck you Caleb. - I'm coming over. - Don't do that. - You won't come clean, maybe Anna's gonna have some answers for me. - I told you don't come to my fucking house, you complete fucking asshole! - I'm on my way. What do you mean? - I mean I don't think it was Riker. Why would he do something like that? - To freak you out. He's got some kind of sick fascination with you. I think he'd do anything for some attention. - That is not fair. He's never done anything like this before. - He almost gave me a fucking concussion. I cannot believe you're trying to defend that little shit. - I'm not, I'm not! I'm just saying that, - What? What are you saying? - He knew the dream, okay. He knew exactly what it looked like. How could he have known? - Listen, Abby, that night we were drinking and smoking god knows what, who knows what he put in there? - What? - I'm just saying you don't know what he did to you that night. For all we know he could have planted this whole thing in your head. - You think Riker fucking inceptioned me? Are you fucking serious Caleb? - Why not? It's easier to believe than some-- - Than what? Hm? Than what? Say it. - Then some fucking monster breaking into our house and drawing on the mirror with your lipstick. - You think I'm crazy. - No, I don't Abby. - Or stupid. It's one or the other Caleb, so take your fucking pick. - No, come back. Fuck! Hi guys. I know my channel's usually pretty light hearted, but I've had some pretty intense shit going on recently. Kind of a long story, but basically my girlfriend thinks that we're being attacked by a monster. My best friend is encouraging her and neither of them are acting like themselves. Been kinda at a loss, so I figured I'd ask you guys on the internet for help. Put all the details in the description below. It's easier to write everything down, that way I don't forget anything. I feel like I'm going crazy. I know it's stupid, but there's only so much of listening to people say batshit things before they start to make sense a little bit, ya know? I mean, Abby's always been a bit of an attention seeker. She's done some pretty annoying things before, but not like this. She's been downplaying it. She doesn't wanna talk about anything. She acts scared all the time. Sometimes I just wanna shake her until-- - What are you doing? - Nothing babe. - So this is where they start, no idea why. And they keep going around the side of the house. On the other side of the gate. All the way to the back porch and they end there. - You feeling it yet? - What? - Yeah you are. - You think I'm gorgeous. - Everyone thinks you're gorgeous Abby. - Even Caleb? - Yes, even Caleb. - Yeah. Me and every other girl in a short skirt. - It's his nature. - It's my nature to get fucked. - Could be worse, my nature is to-- - Brood. - No, my nature is to be crazy. It runs in my family. My dad was homeless or in and out of jail for most of his life. The last thing he ever said to me was don't let it get you. Words to fucking live by. - It always comes down to daddy issues, doesn't it? Last time I talked to my dad he told me I was a shameless slut and kicked me out of the house. - I think that's supposed to be called tough love. - It's the shameless part that really gets me. I mean doesn't everybody enjoy sex? - Sex is pretty fucking great. - But shameless means I'm supposed to be sorry for it. Like it's my fault that guys are shallow assholes. When Caleb does it, nobody thinks anything of it. It's like, - Why don't you ditch that douche? - And go where? With what money? - I'm sorry, I shouldn't, - Do you really mean it? - Yes, but I didn't mean to upset you, I-- - No. Do you really think I should leave? - Did you hear that? - Riker stop. I'm scared. - It's all right Abby, I'll be right back. I just need to find out what it was. - No, don't go, please, stay with me. I shouldn't. Riker. Riker, I've had too much. Riker. Riker. - Were you having sexual relations with him? - No, not recently. - But you two were lovers. - No, once, just once, I never should have, it was a mistake. It was a mistake. - Is that why you bit him? Was he trying to force himself on you? - No, no, no. - Were you angry at him? - He was attacking me. - So it was self defense, you bit him to protect yourself? - No. - I wanna have a fucking adult conversation with you. - Yeah, you're being real adult right now. - Fuck you Abby! You sit at home alone all day, you won't leave the house, you won't talk to anyone, just tell me what's going on. - You already know. - No, honey, I don't. I don't know. But I want to, just tell me. Abby, I wanna be there for you. I wanna help you, just tell me what to do. Abby, there's nothing there. Abby? Abby what are you doing? Honey say something, you're scaring me. - It was just me Caleb. The whole time we thought I was something else. But it was just me. - What are you talking about? Abby what are you doing? No, no, no, no, gimme that. No, let go, let go. Ah shit! She sleeps 16 hours a day. When she's awake she stares at the window or the wall. Or she just draws that symbol. She's just not herself. I'm sorry about last week, flipping out on you. - Yeah, that was a dick move. - I said I'm sorry. - Apology accepted. So who is she? - What? - You said she's not herself, so have you put any thought into figuring out who she is? - What do you mean? - Look, I recommend that we get professional fucking help. But since that's not gonna happen, maybe we need to start thinking outside the box. I know you're not the most open minded person in the world but just hear me out, okay? - All right, I'm listening. - All of this started happening after that night in the woods. Maybe something happened. - Okay, I was passed out and you and Abby went on some misguided adventure through the woods. And you guys saw something. - I didn't see anything. - But you said, - No, I was telling you about a dream that I had. It was all hazy and fuzzy like dreams are. I don't actually remember much from that night at all. - Well you were blackout drunk. - Maybe. She only had a couple of shots. - Yeah, and hits of whatever the hell you put in that pot. - It was super mild. I know Abby has a tendency to freak out, and I didn't want things to go south. But the important point is that we weren't hallucinating. - But you said you didn't see anything. - No, I didn't. - What are you getting at? - Look, these were taken in my yard, going all the way around my house and into the back. - Riker, stop. - No, Caleb, these are way too big to be animal tracks. They're proof. - Riker stop! Okay, I don't care if you believe this group delusion paranoid bullshit or not, but I will not be a part of it, okay? - Caleb, she isn't telling either of us what's really going on, she knows more than she's saying. Caleb, wait. - What are you doing with that? - Waiting for you. - Yeah? So you feeling better? - That all depends on you, baby. - What? - Come on, it's your moment in the spotlight. Give us a show. - That's not funny Abby. - Aw come on baby, it's a party, right? That's it? That's all you got? - Put the fucking camera down, Abby. - Oh sorry baby, you know what you boys do to me. It's criminal. He scares me, I don't wanna be here anymore. - We have bigger things to be scared of, Abby. - How's your mom? - She's gone. - What? Since when? - About a week. She's disappeared before for a couple days here and there, but never this long, and Anna's freaking out, I can't even get her to go to school or leave the house, or barely do anything at all. She just won't calm down, she's driving me crazy. - Riker. She's only 12 years old, cut her some slack. I'm sorry. - I think it has something to do with the thing in the woods. - How? - It came to the house. Abby I need you to talk to me about it. I need you to remember. Is Caleb home? - No, he stays away most of the time. I think he's scared of me. - I'm coming over. - Now? - I have to figure this shit out. My name is Riker Trask, I'm here with Abby Singer to discuss the events of September seventh at Blackwood forest. - Riker, what are you doing? - Abby, do you remember that night? - Yeah, don't you? - Tell me what happened. - We all went into the woods, you and me and Caleb. And Caleb fell asleep. - Go on. - And then we, you and me, went for a walk together in the woods and then we, - After that. What happened after, Abby? - We saw something in the trees. - We didn't see anything, you were alone. - No, no. - Yes. - No, I saw you, you were there. - I wasn't there. Why are you lying? - Riker you were there, you were right next to me. - Abby I wasn't there! You were alone. What did you see? - I, - Use your fucking words, Abby, what did you see? - I saw, I saw, we saw something in the trees. - We didn't see anything. It was you, try again. What did you see? - I saw, I saw a shadow move in the trees. I saw a shadow move in the trees and I-- - What did the shadow look like? - I, it was dark, I, I, I-- - You saw it, tell me. - I was, I was alone and I saw it in the trees and it, - What did, what did it look like? - Well it had, it had, it had, - It had what? - It had red, red, - It had red what? I need to know what was red. What was red? - It was, it was, it was red eyes, it was I, I - Good. - I saw red eyes in the trees. We, I, I was alone, I saw red eyes in the trees and I saw, - What else did you see? - Red eyes in the trees, what else? - I, I, I, I, - Abby, red eyes in the trees, what else? - I, I, - I, I, I, I, I need a fucking sentence here! What did you see? - No! I don't know! - You do know! - I saw it. - You saw it. - I saw it. I was alone and I saw it. - It came back with you. - I saw it, I, - Abby, I need you to listen to me. You know what it wants. What does it want? - I don't know. - Abby, tell me what it wants. You know what it wants, you know what it wants. - Get the fuck out of my house! - Get your hands off me. She knows what it wants! - It came back with, and it came back with me and I saw it and I, I, It had red eyes. It had red, it had red eyes and I saw it. And I brought it back with me and I was, and I, I, I don't know. I don't know. - Hey Cara, been a couple of days, I haven't heard anything from you. Starting to get a little worried. Just gimme a call back, lemme know you're okay, alright? I miss you. I'll talk to you later, alright? - Riker, Riker leave us the fuck alone. - Maybe I-- - No, I don't want you talking to him. It's for your own good. - I'm a bad person. - Me too. - No, I mean I slipped something into Caleb's drink. I wasn't trying to, I just wanted to talk to you without Caleb telling you what to say. - Caleb doesn't tell me what to say. - I don't know what's happened to him. He didn't used to be like this, and I hate the way he talks to you. And I know he's going out with other girls too, - I know. I've known for a long time. - Why don't you do anything? - I tried a couple of times, it never worked. - Why? - He's a good talker. So you were trying to rescue me. - Yeah, I fucked that one up. - Yeah. - I wasn't trying to seduce you. - That is exactly what you were doing. - It's getting closer. - I know. - I'm not gonna let it get you. - Where were you? - Does it really matter? - Yeah, it matters. Just tell me where you were. Were you with him? - Does it matter now? - Yeah. - What about now? - Yes, Abby it fucking matters. - What about now? Does it matter now? It doesn't fucking matter. Don't pretend. - I'm going out. I've gotta-- - Don't bother. - Hello? - Is Caleb there? - He's out. What's wrong? - I need your help. - What are you talking about? What do you need? - It's mom, she's hurt. - Did you call an ambulance? - I can't, I can't explain. Look, can you get here soon? - Caleb left his car, I-- - Get the keys and take it. There isn't much time. - Is Anna okay? - She's scared, please hurry. Abby, it's here. - Riker? Anna? Are you here? Oh my god. Riker, what are you doing? Riker say something. - What's up? - Riker's dead. - What do you mean? - I killed him. - Where are you? - Riker's. - All right, stay there, I'm coming, just stay there. - Please answer the question Miss singer. - I don't remember, I wasn't there. - Do you remember seen Riker's mother? Did you have anything to do with that? - No. - Do you know who killed her? Did Riker do that? - I wasn't there. - Caleb Sidolf? - Yeah. You could see her now. - How ya holding up? You wanna talk about what happened? - What do you want to know? - Cops told me you had to fight Riker off. You had to kill him. They said it was in self defense. - Is Anna dead? - They didn't tell you? - They didn't tell me anything. They just kept asking me questions, the same questions over and over and over and-- - Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. - Tell me. - They found Anna dead in the bathroom. They think he killed her right before you showed up. Miss Trask had been dead for a few hours. - Why would, what else? - You sure you wanna talk about this? - What else? - They found Cara Sexton dead. She was in the cellar, half frozen. - Well, that's too bad. - She'd been dead for at least a week. - A week? I just saw him the other day. We were talking. - I know. He'd been, - Tell me. - He'd been cutting pieces off of her, They don't know why. - He had to feed it. Did they tell you what I did? - They said you killed him and that it was in self defense. - No, I bit him. More than once. - You had to. - I liked it. I didn't wanna stop. I think Riker finally figured it out at the end. Do you wanna know what it wants? - She's been through a lot. It's normal that she might act a little strange. - Strange how? - Emotional outbursts, feelings of guilt, anger, she might disconnect, acting apathetic or distant. But you have to remember regardless of what she might tell you, she's feeling some very extreme and conflicting emotions right now. But it's important that you help encourage her to explore these feelings, no matter how irrational they may seem. - She said something about when she bit him, she liked it, she didn't want it to stop. - Yes, she said something similar to me and I read the police report. - Have you ever seen anything like that before? - Psychosis takes many different forms in many different patients. - I looked it up online, said there's something called wendigo psychosis? - Yes, I've heard of it. - Sounds a lot like this. - Look, I appreciate that you're trying to help, - She's trying to eat people. She thinks she's turning into a monster. Sounds pretty spot on to me. - Delusions take different forms in different cultures. The psychosis you're referring to is simply a hundred year old mis-diagnosis of schizophrenia, which I do not believe Abby is suffering from. More likely, she's suffering from post traumatic stress. She's feeling guilt and anger over her decision to defend herself-- - Is she gonna be okay? - I'd like to keep her a few more days for observation. - Whatcha looking at? Anything going on out there? - Not now, soon. - What's that? - It's going to come. - You know what the doctor said? Just reacting to things that Riker planted in your brain, it's okay. I'm not mad, I just want you to come home soon. - You don't want me after this. I'm damaged goods. - Don't say that. You'll get better. Things'll go back to the way they were. - I don't want that anymore. - You don't mean that. - You're a dangerous person, Caleb. You've done so many awful things to me. - It's in your head, Abby. Those are Riker's words. - I think I'm done talking. - She doesn't talk anymore. Doesn't really do anything by herself. Doctors keep saying just give her time. I see the looks they give each other. And her dad hasn't come to see her. Not that she'd want him to, but still wish somebody would show up. Can't handle this by myself. Fuck, why should I have to? Her insurance isn't great. Pretty sure we're gonna be in a lot of debt once this is over. Keep worrying if they can come after me for something like that. Pretty shitty thing to be thinking right now. Then one of the doctors say that they wanna move her to a permanent facility. Feel like this is my fault. I can't stand feeling like this. I'm 22 fucking years old, why should I have to deal with this? Sometimes I hate her. And Riker. It's not her fault, but I just wanna shake her and tell her to grow up and take some fucking responsibility. She's right. I don't think I can be with her anymore. Not after this. I can't just abandon her with nothing though. I have to make her better. I obviously won't be posting this. - Can I help you? - Did you see somebody come through here? - I didn't see no one. - Now somebody just knocked on my door, and I was just wondering if maybe you let somebody in, - Listen man, I can't help you. I'm sorry. - Did you give somebody a key? What the, I'm going crazy. They're gonna move you to a special facility next week. Between you and me, I don't think these doctors have a fucking clue. Shouldn't say this but, my best friend's dead and nobody's here to really answer my calls. You're the only person I have left to talk to. I miss you Abby. I'm sorry for everything I did to hurt you. I don't think you're crazy, if it's any consolation. I think you're just sick. I don't know if something caused it, or if it's still causing it. If it's something in your head or something else. - It's you. - Sir, you're gonna have to get back, give her some room. - He wants to kill me. He wants to eat me. - It's alright, one more. - She told me everything. I didn't listen. There's this, ache. Hunger. I don't know what to call it. Like something's clawing its way into my brain. You're not yourself. Something's making this happen. I have to believe that. I have to find it. Make it stop. I have to find it and make it stop. Riker knew first, then Abby. Now I finally get it. It becomes you, then you become it. Or maybe it's the other way around.
