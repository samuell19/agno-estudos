Every angel is terrifying - Rainer Maria Rilke Youth - torches in hands, hair in the wind, enlighten, you give a push, the road is holy, heights in all that I sing whatever I dream, you are hopes, flowers and fruits act and belief, handsome boys, cute girls, new people over eons, suns shining out of you, offering centuries and meaning to a new life, new justice, high purpose, beauties... On August 30th 1944, the liberating soviet troops are entering in Bucharest. In November 1946, the communists are defrauding the elections and they are appointing the Government. In June 1948 it is started the nationalization of the means of production. On March 2nd 1949, the ownership of land is totally forbidden for the individuals. Almost 50 years of communism are following. Between 1947 and 1962 more than 250,000 persons, who opposed the communist system, were killed in mountains, prisons or labour camps. It was not known very much about those who used weapons to oppose the system. This movie speaks about them. I am wondering continuously why are here are so many ladybugs. Look how many are they. Their larvae and themselves are eating leaves' lice and look, I am using a magnifying glass, and I cannot see any plant lice. I am suspecting that they are eating something else. Because usually they are staying only on Bujorei or Rhododendrons. How many small things are different as they are saying. Yes, it could be. What can I say? For example, do you remember in the Spring the cuckoos flock, while the science sustains that they are travelling alone? Yea. Barely. I have to write down this story with the Coccinellidae, because this is their scientifically name. Coccinellidae. How they are named? Coccinellidae. I want to show this notebook to Bocicai, my colleague. You met him. This guy is a genius in the Natural Science field. Like our Ghita at Chemistry. Hey, drop it, drop it. I assume he managed to escape of being apprehended. It would be a great loss. Listen. Did I tell you about the smallest Priest's daughter nearby Targu Mures? - Yes. - It was three years ago. She was studying at a College for Housekeeping in Cluj. Oh, yes, housekeeping. And she made a cake of strawberries, Mosule (Old Man). - Did I tell you? - Nope. Hell, no?! So... I asked her to allow me to carry it to the boys, so I can show off that I did it. - And did she allow you? - She allowed me. She gave it to me. Those guys died of envy. Really? Serious. They were convinced that I did it. Listen up, Professor. Why are you not writing few lines to her? Without signing them. What the hell, Mosule. The biggest good deed that I can do for her is to let her to forget me, to get married and have a lot of kids. Us... Look... The ladybugs can fly and they're falling onto the ground. Not that they are foretelling our deaths. They say that... the air is too hot and they cannot fly anymore. THE FIGHTER'S PORTRAIT IN HIS YOUTH 6 km East of Vadu River May 21st, 1949 Mosule, are those guys coming or not? When are they arriving? I don't know. They should appear. Leule (the Lion)! Go on! Green leaves of little willow, Maria and Mary, For three days I have been sick, Maria and Mary, If this would be my life's end I hope that... I won't die for good. Quiet! Easy, bros, without the weapons. Easy. Easy. Like me. Let it be. Where is Prodan? He is slightly ill. Is he injured? No, he is not injured, but he remained in the valley. Who's Andrei? I am Andrei. Where are you encamped? At a chalet, nearby a small river. Do you know it? Yes, we know it. Let's go. Let's. You take the lead. Come on. We fought in the Vrancea mountains. But were sold out and they had setup a trap. And how did you escape? We were lucky. I don't know how we've been so lucky. They lured us with a lie, that a revolution had started in the villages. This is how they caught us. Many of us died. If you need a doctor, how do you manage? We are arresting one if it is necessary. At your College in Fagaras, the Brotherhood is still active? In Vrancea we relied on the Brotherhoods from Focsani. Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons! Who are you? Who are you? We are Security officers. - You thought that I will sell my little brothers? - Shut up! On your knees and your arms behind your neck! Did you think that I will sell them? Who is at the chalet? Who is at the chalet? Rudan. - Only himself? - Yes, just himself. Mosule. Rudane! Comrades, every craftsman, every doctor, every man has a tool. And he is taking care of his tool. Here at Securitate, what is our tool? People's Security General Direction Meeting of Regional and Counties Security Leaders March 2nd, 1950 I said that we have, too. If the hair cutter has a razor, if the turner has a lathe. Deputy Home Affairs Minister, Security Deputy Director Lieutenant General Pintilie Gheorghe (Pantelei Bodnarenko) I said that we also have one. Our tools are our informers, comrades. We have to know how to work, to see with whom we are dealing with. In the same way the worker takes care of his tool, we are taking care of our informers. We cannot say that the fight has finished. We can say that only now we are starting to give stronger blows. Only now the enemy is raged. We have to use the methods thought to us by the Party. And only then we will have successes in our field. Put them two side by side and take photos. With their weapons. The Party is showing us, but he is not teaching. Let's take examples from the Soviet Union which conquered every square meter, every step, but it did not step back. This is the way we have to fight and to go forward. The biggest enemy is our shortages, comrades. This is the biggest enemy that has entered in ourselves and we have to take it out by whatever costs. By education... and discipline. We must analyse our mistakes, to see how to work with our organs. How we need to grow them up. We need honest and dedicated members of the Party, who have a pro-Party attitude. Otherwise it is not possible. Let's start with the methods thought to us by the Party. Come on! One down, one in that direction. Two. Two there. Let's go. We are not meeting in the whole world a similar experience to the one that is in our Party. So, what the fuck we are searching for foreign methods? We have from where to learn. From the Bolshevik Party we don't need to search for something unknown, when the Bolshevik Party gave us almost everything into our mouths. Good Evening, Miss. Welcome to the Collective. Come on, you too, this way. It is not OK at the Collective? - Hey, easy with the piano! - There is no piano, comrade. Stupid. What are you doing, miss. Please come here. Here on the grass. Come here. Get there. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing, you motherfucker. Get down! Get down, beside him! Get down, beside him! What is it? - There are some potatoes, comrade. - Are there any roots? - Yes. - Take them out, to hell with them. Fuck your family. Get there. Please, come here, miss. Fuck you in the mouth. Where is the boy? Where is the boy? Is he in the mountains? To fight in the mountains. Is he a hotshot? Do you know what is he doing in the mountains? Do you know what is he doing in the mountains? He is killing my men. This is what he is doing. The whole our organ is a clear brain. We do not have any bones. None. This is the fight that he is carrying on. We are brains and this is the way we have to think about it. We are an organ that works mostly with the head. We are studying the problem, we are analyzing it. We are not beating just because we are devoted to the Party. Galasescu Ridge May 5th, 1950 Let's write them a note. Write down: We could have shot you as we're shooting redbreasts. One by one. But we are good guys. Stop searching for us. signed: Romanian National Army We do not know for what reasons they recorded themselves. Because it is a mistake. People's Security General Direction from Sibiu May 27th, 1950 Probably because they are arrogant. Anyway this is not a message for us. The recording seems to be recent, probably this year, based on the foliage and landscape. And based on the last dates when they were observed in their own residences or at the exams, those who are students. The video camera is a German Treka on 8 mm, and the film rolls where found in an abandoned backpack while they were successfully escaped from an encirclement near Vistea. They have abandoned the following things: 2 shovels, 1 hammer, 1 ball of string, 1 pot, 2 blankets, 1 Bessar compass, 1 Beretta pistol. The group seems to be lead by Ion Gavrila Ogoranu aka Old Man, who was studying Agronomy and Economics at the moment of his disappearance from his residence. Age 26, member of the Brotherhoods of the Cross from the Radu Negru College. Ion Chiujdea aka The Professor, age 25, studying Natural Sciences, together with Gavrila graduated the Commissioned Officers' Military School. Ion Ilioi, age 28. Silviu Socol, age 25. This guy with the unbuttoned shirt. Gheorghe Sovaiala, this guy with the moustache, age 25, worker in Brasov. Gelu Novac, age 25. Studying Mathematics. Gheorghe Hasiu aka Ghita, this guy with the photo camera, the brother of Laurian Hasiu. Age 28, Chemistry teacher. This naked guy. Nelu Novac, the brother of Gelu, age 27. Laurian Hasiu, this guy in the left lower area, who is sleeping. Remus Sofonea, aka Brancoveanu. Age 22, this guy with the boot. Mihai Magat, age 20, studying Medicine, the guy from right at the rear. Virgil Rades, that guy from the left, age 22, student. Jean Pop aka Fileru, age 31, forest ranger. Andrei Hasiu, this guy with the pistol, aka Baciu (Sheperd), age 30, carpenter, brother of Gheorghe Hasiu. Victor Metea, age 27 at the moment of his disappearance from his residence. Other members of the group are Toma Pirau aka Porumb (Corn), Marcel Cornea, studying Pharmacy, Andrei Mogos and Nicolae Mazilu. A total 15 outclassed elements but it seems that more are gathering. All of them fled to avoid the apprehension. They have expressed themselves against the regime. It was tried to arrest and interrogate their parents, relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, but unfortunately so far with no results. The hostile gang elements expressed few times, as it was revealed during the interrogation, that they are waiting to be helped by the Imperialists and after the Anglo-American attack against the Communist regime originated from the East they will start an attack in favour of the Imperialist Powers in order to overthrown the democratic regime elected by the people. The gang operates mainly in the Fagaras Mountains where they are hiding, being helped by the people from villages located at the foothills of the mountains. They are offering the following: cheese, potatoes, corn flower, onions, sugar, beans, bread, pots, hammers, balls of string, skin jackets, blankets, domestic objects utterly necessary to live the difficult life in the mountains. We know that they are using hideouts dug underground for themselves and for their supplies. We do not know by what means they obtained the weapons and the ammunition, but according to these images we can see that they have sub-machine guns: Orita, Beretta: Germans with metal stock and Russians with round magazines, ZB rifles and all sort of grenades. These are weapons remained even from the friendly Russian Army. If the comrades would know how their weapons are used now... They have also some military equipment such as: binoculars, compasses, different types of cartridge mags and ammunition. Seldom they are travelling in large groups. They are moving in small groups, ranging from 3 to 6 persons, in order to avoid to be spot easily and to have a good mobility. They are always searching for food and they are trying to recruit new members. It seems that they are gathering once at each few months or weeks, according to the statement given through interrogation by one of our collaborator who had a good connection with the group. We do not know exactly how the small groups are communicating, probably using signs and notes left in places known only to themselves. In the forwarded report I highlighted the importance of infiltrating of some reliable agents, some reliable persons, trustworthy personnel who must spend time in the mountains. they should pretend that they are so-called partisans and through deception and with the help of the network of agents developed in the villages from the foothills... With their help we can apprehend these villains, these enemies of our Party and of our Socialist arrangement. Ghita. What are you going to do? Are you going with them or are you coming with us? I will go with them. I want to see my boy. I would stay with my wife. Ok. What do we need? Two pairs of boots, socks. - Tell your mother that I need a hatchet. - I will tell her. Good, what else? - Needles and strings. - Batteries. Some sugar, something to write with and some foils. Ok,. We will meet at Eleni. - Don't go near the sheep holds! Ok? - No. We'll go on the valley. Ghita. You are coming back, aren't you? So? After you get the land, what are going to do? I will build the house. A small house. Not a big house as the landlords have. Smaller. Two cows. Wife. How come she's the second? First the cows and then the wife? Yes. So what? I will not die of starvation. 6 km West of Ileni village August 30th, 1950 Do you think they saw us? Nope, but we have to enter now in the village. If we're entering now in the village, we are not generating suspicions. Nope. - Wait, let them pass by. - Come on. Let them pass by. Where are you going? Let them pass by. - We are entering afterwards. - Come on. Give me the weapon. - Did you put a sign? - It is not necessary, I know the tree. I hope he is at home. I am hungry. I'm fed up eating just plain bread. He has to be. Where he can be? What are we doing? What are we doing? What can we do now? Let's go. Let me speak. - What are doing? - Come on, keep walking. Hello. Hello. Where are you going? We were at my sister from Sambata. I didn't ask you where are coming from, I asked where are you going. Show me your IDs. Yes, of course. I want to go back to my kin. To tell them that I am ok. Porumbule, are you crazy? The village is full, bro. I'm not going back. I have to go. My mother is worried. I cannot let her like that till next spring. Look, I am not going there. I'm going to Cornea's haystack and I'll stay there till the morning, and we will meet in the morning at the entrance of the village. Think well. I am not going back. I'm going to Breaza. I'm going to Dragu and I will stay in the barn. Let's do it. The Party is teaching us, that when we find a mistake to go deeper, to find the causes. If we go to the dentist and he extracts a healthy tooth, what kind of thing is this? We have arrested the legionnaires. The directive was clear. And now we are discovering that there are persons weren't legionnaires. We put in jail persons weren't legionnaires. Only now we are discovering this. It was issued a decision that the leaders to be taken. We have taken people in bulk. Villain, legionnaire. By doing so we helped the enemy. The discipline must be tighter. The comrades must be thought. We don't know all the fighting's methods of the kulak. It has different forms. We are compelled to go deeper, to know all the forms, to see how to fight with the kulak. Where is your brother? This is the our situation. Where is your brother? Either we think we are the navel of the Earth, either is liberalism,... ...which the Party is denying with all its strength. He is a fighter. You have to change completely your attitude. If you don't change your attitude then I'll change it. The Party decided that we have to set-up labour camps. Let's call them gulags. Working colonies, working detachments. There was not yet found the right name. It is still under debate, in order to have also a political justification. And maybe after one week or two, we will have also gulags, or how it is now designated, working colonies. We have to put someone there, because they cannot be empty. access into Ileni village August 31st 1950, 4.55 pm On the left and on the right. Fall in. Move on. Dumitru Costea's barn Do not worry, cause... I will let her know and she will be here in the morning to see you. Take some bread. Are you coming from a long distance? Have a rest, 'cause we'll speak later. I let you sleep. Porumb! I am Captain Sebastian Liht, Regional Direction Security from Sibiu. My men have surrounded you. You have no chance. Do not make any stupid things and come out with your arms raised in the air. Did you sell me? They will find you. You won't escape even if you're hidden in a snake's pit. Only dead I am surrendering. Listen to my command. Fire. Do not shoot cause I brought your mother. Pirau. Look at her, she's outside. Look at her here. Take your hands off her. My dear son. Mom, what are you doing here? I will kill all of you. My dear son. Mom, go away. Do not shot, you, skunk. Mom, go away. Stop firing. Stop firing. Hold your position. Do not move. Porumb! Porumb! It's over, you motherfucker. That's enough. Do not shoot. Porumb, you are surrounded. It's over. Do not shoot. Give your self, Porumb! My sweet cub. Children, what have you done? September 3rd, 1950 People's Security General Direction September 10th, 1950 Now let's see how we are dealing with the religion. A comrade who is with the mystics, doesn't have a place with us. The comrades who are religious, members or not of the Party, very well. My whole love for them, but they can work somewhere else. It is better without them. Here there is no place for the comrades who are believing in God. Our duty is to take away the citizen from the priest' influence and slowly to remain with his honesty. This is the hardest part which was not solved completely even in the Soviet Union. This attitude has to be mainly toward the Orthodox priests. All of them are deceitful, perverts. We have to study each of them, individually. Regarding the Catholics priests, they are more or less Jesuits. But it is very hard to weigh them, either Orthodox or Catholic. All of them are Jesuits. All of them are bandits. We are hitting them with the same power, either them being Orthodox or Catholic. The Party decided to hit with the full power. We hit with the full power. We are a leading organ and we have assumed tasks. Who is not doing that, should step up in the front of the Party to ask to be relieved of the tasks. Hey, Father. People's Security General Direction from Pitesti September 18th, 1950 Do you know what I wanted to ask you? Look, I am bothered by one thing and I know that you are... ... intellectual, so I think you can answer. Hey, Father, do you believe in God? Major Alimanescu As humane is possible. See, here I have a problem, with this stuff. You are disappointing me. Do you know why? Look... I am... ... puzzled, I don't know how to tell you. I thought that you... you who are with the church, you are smarter to take the money from the stupid people, but you are not believing in all these stupid things. Look, I am giving you an example. Both of us we are staying in this room, aren't we? You... ...are... ... slightly chipped, You are not feeling well. Pity on you. Where is that God of yours? Why is he not striking me with a thunderbolt? Why did he let you on your own? Explain to me! God is patient. He knows why. I cannot answer on his behalf. It seems that you don't understand a thing. What the hell, I am wasting my voice here? I think you didn't get enough beating. We are wasting our time with you. Seriously. I mean... It's like a sobering situation for you. I don't know how to say... It seems that all of you are drunk. They fooled you because I don't understand. I don't understand how a grown up adult, meaning that he is not a child anymore, can believe such a thing. It means that you are telling me that... there is one guy up there who is flying or how? Who is looking downward to us and he punishes us... Or how? I don't understand, Father. Really. I think you should think, I am seriously now. I don't have anything else to think about now. I believe in God. I think there is God and that's all. I'm saying that a pray is not harming at all. Vasile. Vasile. Bring that guy. What the hell are you so stupid? I think all you got stupid. It seems for me that all of you are crazy. I think that all of you are drunk. Is not the Party teaching everything that is needed? Don't you have everything you want? You don't want to work. But you are fooling the people and you don't recognize that. Look at this guy, for example. He is a motherfucker. A villain who says that he is a partisan. He doesn't like us. He ran with weapons and other stupid guys, because we are arresting his mother and his father. He steals, he beats people. He is a partisan and he is waiting for Americans to come. And the Americans... don't give a shit. No American is coming. They give a shit. The Americans and British are giving a shit about your God and about your partisans. Do you understand? This legionnaire eats shit that he is a fighter. But he doesn't want to work, do you understand? Are you paying attention? Do you think that these guys are staying as you are staying with the Bible in your hands? They are discussing theories and then they are killing my people. Do you understand, Father? Fuck your asses. And now I will step on him. And now I will step on him to see where is your God. Do you understand? I will beat him. I will beat him and I will wait to see. Who is coming to save you? Your God or the Americans? Do you understand? Do you understand? Do you understand? And I will do the same for you until the Devil will take both of you. And you will understand there is no God. There is no American coming, do you understand? Am I not patient? The Party doesn't have patience with you? Snots. What? Am I not patient? You have to find Ogoranu wherever he is. Bring to me all the priests, all the legionnaires, their mothers, their fathers, everybody. I will arrest all of you. For fuck sake do something! Am I not patient? I will find you! What? Am I not patient? Do I not have patience with you? Vistea September 20th, 1950 - Ioane. - Hello, Father. It's so long since I haven't seen you. - Let's get inside. - No, I can't. - Come in. - No. Do you have something for us? Yes, of course. Let's get inside. No, I can't. I'm taking whatever you're giving and I'm gone. OK. Wait for me. You wait for me here. Ana, go. What are you doing, Ana? I am staying. With my father. What have you done in the meantime? Not much. How is the school? It's OK. OK. If it is OK, than it is OK. What are you doing? I cannot do anything. Yes. Ioane, run. There are troops. Take this and leave. Run away. Forward! March! On a double! On a double. What are doing your kin? They are OK. - Do you still have the cows? - Nope. They took everything. Don't worry, you will grow up. Meeting with the lads from Parau September 4th, 1951 - Hello. - Hello, lads. Lads. Gavrila, Chiujdea, Ilioi, Andrei, Laurian Hasiu, Baciu and Leul. - Hello. - Hello. Come on. Speak up, lads. We want to join. To whom? Join to whom? To whom?! To you! We want to fight. We are ready. With whom do you want to fight? We want to fight. We want to push the Russians out of the country. I don't know what do you think that we are doing, what kind of life it means. But I am looking at you and I can see that you are young. I think it is better for you to go home, finish your studies, get married, have kids and forget about all of these. Because is not for you. You don't know how it is. Have you hold a weapon in your hands? Have you killed before a man? Do you know how it is? To look into his eyes and to have no options. To live with this stuff. To not forget it. This is not for you. Do you think we had a choice? We have parents who are under arrest, brothers beaten,... fled wives. There is nothing left for us to go back for. If we are going back, the prison is waiting for us or worst. Do you know what we are doing here? We are waiting. For the Brits, the Americans, the French to come. Whoever is going coming, if someone will come. We are waiting. Do you think it'is easy? What do you want to do? To stay with us in holes in the ground like worms? To eat trees' bark? To have frostbites during the winter? To not see people months in a row? This is what you want? Look how we're going to do. We will meet in a month, two months. And if you still want this, we will see. OK? Take the cans, too. Rausor Village, Valer Pica's house September 27th, 1951 Run. No. - We have to split. - Hurry up. Come on. Come on. Wouldn't have been better if we slept in the attic in the hay? He doesn't want to hear about that. The guest outside and himself in the house? This is the man. You cannot change him. Pridon's teacher house September 28th, 1951 Halt. Nobody moves. You, motherfucker! Take the weapons. Against the wall. The weapons. Move on. - Hurry up, to the car. - Shut up. Move on. Move on. - Up in the truck. - Move on. Toderita village, Dumitru Dusa's yard September 30th, 1951 Fuck your mother. Get the weapon. Let's carry him. Go and bring the car. Come on. Give me a hand. Get in the car. Lift him. People's Security General Direction from Sibiu Based on the investigations the conclusions were: there is no gangs central command at the country level. March 2nd, 1952 There is no connection between the gangs and the former political parties and other subversive organisations. There is no connections between the gangs and the clergy. There is no gangs' interference in the kulak's counterrevolutionary activities. There is no organised connections with the Romanian traitors from abroad or with the Imperialist's Missions from Romania. Given the specific conditions under which the gangs groups are operating, the leading organs of Securitate are setting a base task for the Regional Directions so they should intensify the information gathering activities. When an informer will be recruited the following means can be used: Persuasion, valid for people with character. A weakness incitement and offering of material gains in order to enhance it. Being in debt, due to different services offered to them, then they can be asked to work for us. Write down. Intimidation. To use the information we have regarding the possible guilt of the targeted person. Where is he? Tell me where is he? Blackmail. Based on the eventual information that is compromising, the approach can be done in two ways: Insinuating. Speak up! or by surprise. The informants will be recruited mainly from the line of work that allows them to travel. doctors, health agents, agriculture agents, notary, priests, and in this case shepherd, forest workers, rangers, lodge managers. It is not recommended to recruit from the democratic parties. On the contrary it is preferable to recruit reactionary elements, comrades. It is true that some informants will avoid to offer information regarding the gang, because they are not believed. but through physical persuasion they are forced to tell the precise information. Some of the comrades are not keeping the contact, as the Party says, with the informants that are working in the gang area. They are not guiding well the informants toward the objectives, and especially they don't know how to be closer with them, using hard methods that are actually enlarging the gap, frightening and because of that they are avoiding the contact with our organs. But what is means this, comrades? It means that we have to take care of them. To give them instructions, to show them the Party line. You are not taking them and you are filling them with bruises. If a carpenter destroys his lathe, what is he eating tomorrow? This is the way the Party is teaching us, comrades? The operative worker must create friendships with the working peasant where he is lodging and to whom he is always paying on time, fair and thankfully for the accommodation and other offered services. He is bonding friendships also with the peasant from whom he rents a carriage, with the horses. Or an element was sentenced in court. It happened to be a poor element. He was judged and sentenced for his actions. The widow survived. His actiuns drew the conviction and the seizure of the wealth. A seizure document is issued so the wealth seizure to be performed. Are we going to confiscate the goods? We are going. Who is going? The organs. What are we seizing? A hamlet and a 16 years cow. From whom? From his wife with 5 children. And all the children are holdung the cow and are starting to cry. Everybody can see that this action is not in the line of strengthening our regime, comrades. Without any doubt, when the lew was created, it wasn't created for this cases. It was created to take the wealth of those who have exploited. To seize the wealth doesn't mean to take the cow from the yard, when she has to raise up 5 kids and their mother. We know this cases when small kids is involved We have to take measures for the father's mistakes. We are not applying mechanically any law. We are thinking, we are weighing, we are assing. When the decision was taken in the Court, maybe it wasn't taken randomly, but it is our task to see how it is applied. This law it is not applied mechanically. We have to take measures against the enemy, comrades. We should not wobble to the left or to the right, but he have to say: Look we will receive directives regarding the security and militia. But until then we know that where the enemy is present, where he wants to be present. We are standing up and we are taking action, comrades. We are hitting the ground with them. The directives, comrades, the directives will develop all the necessary measures to be taken in order to put the enemy at his place. 3 km away of Dridif village May 12, 1952 - Hello, kids, - Hello. - What are you doing? - We have to complete a detachment's mission. We had the task to deliver an important message to the comrade instructor who is located at the lodge. - Yes? What kind of message? - It's a secret. - We're not allowed to speak about it. - Well, if it's a secret, it's a secret. - Are you learning well at school? - Yes, we the pioneers, we are taking only B and A marks. Well done, kids. Those insignia worn by you, what does they mean? This insignia means that we are friends of the Militia. - And what a friend of the Militia should do? - First of all, he has to be vigilant. We are thought how to be vigilant. We have to stop the people's enemy to steal and plunder the community wealth. Have you seen one of these enemies so far? How does he look like? Yes. They are mean and dirty. They have fangs. They are kidnapping children, they are killing them and they are sucking their blood. They are doing only bad deeds. It is not true. They do not have fangs. There are people's enemies in our midst who are not giving their quotas and they are hiding the harvest. - And there are villains who are hiding in the mountains. - Are there any villains like these ones in the village? Yes, the Militia comrade told us that there is one Laurian Hasiu. He is very dangerous. He is kidnapping children and kills people. And he steals from them. And Militia will apprehend him and they will punish him. Well done, children. Take care. Do not meet the villains. Yes, if we meet them we will hand them over to the Militia. We are going this way. Joyful pioneer's farewell. Go on. Do you know the children? Yes, the one with the bow is my grandchild. She is the daughter of my youngest niece. 6 km away from Sambata village July 12th, 1952 Mihai Maga aka Doctor Drop it. Drop the weapon. Drop the weapon. Hands behind your neck. Faster. Come on. Move. Hurry up. Umbrari sheep hold July 21st, 1952 Fuck your lineage. Fuck you, stinking skunk. Speak up, who are you are helping? Fuck your land, why are you hitting me? - Come here. - Why you motherfucker...? Fuck your mother's cunt. Come here when I'm saying. I have asked about Arnautoiu whereabouts. Who are you helping out, cheese man? I am fed up with you, motherfuckers. Speak up. - Please, comrade. Do not kill me. - What? Are you comrade with me? Do not kill me! Let my eyes bulge out if I have seen something. I am swearing on my children's souls. I didn't see anything. - Do not kill me, comrade. Please. - Shut up. There is one left. - Let him go. - Why?! That's enough. I can still hit him. Hey Mazilu, you skunk. I am not hurrying. We will stay here as long as it is necessary, even 100 years if it is needed. We're staying here until you will tell me what I want to hear. Why don't you choose not to feel the pain? Because it is easy to choose not to feel the pain. Speak up what I am asking, and we are over, I stop torturing you. We will go at our homes. Of corse, after we apprehend the villains. Master sergeant Amuzea Dorian Mazilu, I am dying and I don't understand you. Why are you defending them? Why? Are you relatives? You were together to meet women? You are fond of his girlfriend, tell us. Really, tell us that it is not true. You like her. You like her so much! But others are fucking her. Villains. Skunks who is the people's enemies. I cannot help it. So, we have to apprehend them. And I will catch them all, you, skunks. Until no one will be alive, you villains, you, fucking legionnaires. Excuse me... maybe you are with the Peasant's Party. because I do not know anymore. What? There is no nails left? From his legs. Well... Oh, yes. Look Mazilu. What am I going to do now? I do not have anything to pull. There is no nails left. Yes, of course... as we have methods and ideas, because the Party is teaching us, Because is teaching us to be vigilant, look we can find other things to be pulled. So we are shifting to teeth. What can I do, Mazilu? I told you, tell me where he is and you are free. We are staying here until you fucking die. And I am not stopping. Speak up, because you do not have much to live. Tell me where is Ogoranu's? How can I find them? Where are they hiding? Tell me you fuck and your cunt mother. Speak up. I will find all of you. Even in the snake's pit I will find you. You, worms, stinking fuck. I am shitting on you, fucking partisans. Tell me, what are we doing? Are we crossing the border? I don't think it is a good idea. Too many betrayals. I don't know. I trust no one. So where are we going to get through, Baciule, cause there are many of us. - Precisely, how long do you think we will be able to hold on? - As long as it is necessary. When are we entering in the village? In the morning or in the evening? If Grigore had left us a note, in the evening. Otherwise in the morning. Let's stop. Who is going to Breaza? Let's draw straws. We'll meet at the entrance in the village three days from now. If you are not leaving a note to tell us of a change, OK? Left, left. Faster. Left, left. Platoon halt! To the left flank... March! Faster. Faster. Ciobanu's barn, Voivodeni Andrei! Andrei, wake-up! You are surrounded. I didn't betray you. I swear. What are you doing, dumb-ass. Why did you open fire? What can I do, commander comrade. The villain is coming toward me, I was afraid. You dumb-ass motherfucker. July 26th, 1952 Mosule. I heard that they have arrested your mother. And your father is very ill, but... he wasn't taken. I'm saying, even if you are not asking anything, you should not go home for a few days, because they are searching for us everywhere. Yes, I know, but I am thinking to the smaller ones. Yes. Please, think about it. Baciu, didn't leave any note? No. Galbana Peak August 13th, 1952 Uschita! - Hurry up. - Come on. - Go on. - Hurry up. - What are we doing? - I don't know. If they have surrounded on Valea Rea (Evil Valley), it means they have created a circle on Moldoveanu, Galcescu, Dara and Nisipuri peaks. There are too many, to hell with them. If they are there, we have to be outside of the circle, haven't we? Yes, it means that the sheepfolds are guarded. I didn't expect that they were so many. We have to go and reach for the food, haven't we? And the closer stash is on Leaota Ridge, you remember the path on the rock slide. - Near Nisip, yes. - On the South slope. What do you say? But the path that leads under the ridge is not guarded? Yes, it is. If here it is guarded, it means that it is guarded there, too. But what do you want us to do? Do you have another idea? Come on, they are approaching. Come on, we are wasting time. The Lambs' Spring 9 km East of Berivoi village August 14, 1952 The compulsory passing points were covered, where there were setup trap posts, with Militia and Securitate organs wearing civilian clothing. It was established that nowadays Ogoranu's gang has 12 men. People's Security General Direction from Sibiu Because of that, the Operative HQ was established in Fagaras village, at a watermill on the Suiu River, having at his disposal one MAI platoon and one RSB platoon, to block the access paths from the village toward the mountains. I can report that during the mountains operations, the 2nd team couldn't fulfil its mission because the villains entered in the forest, leaving his coat on the road. Despite that, in the area there were discovered stashes of food, weapons and ammunition belonging most likely to Ogoranu's gang. The 3rd group march was performed as planned, but he had problems due to elements, continuously rain and fog. Also it wasn't possible to coordinate the troop actions due to the lack of the communications between both groups mentioned before, the phone cable insulation was removed in one area and there was a short circuit with the moist soil. The radio stations didn't operate during the operations because there were often heavy rains, due to which the telephone network was damaged. The detachments marched only on pathways and they couldn't deploy. Why is this engine not starting? Don't worry, I will take care or it, in a moment. What are we doing? We cannot do anything. We're staying put. toward Saddle Lerescu 6 km East of Gura-Vaii We're staying, OK. But it was supposed to be at Dragus. Leule, the lads will understand? Don't worry, Mosul will understand. Let's go to the food stash, I'm starving. Let's go. 4 km West of Gura-Vaii - How is the knee? - It works. Filerule, what was lost? A tent foil, my waistcoat, the camera, a knife and a mag. If we are keeping it in the same rhythm... Fire. Captain, I'm hit. Flank them. Fire. We're flank them, but they are a lot. From where they came from? - We'll go on the ridge through the forest. - Let's go. They are closer. Hurry up. Move on. Fire. toward Zarna Peak August 16th, 1952 Brothers, they have surrounded us. They are near us. What the hell did you scare me like that? I thought is something tougher. Let's think for a moment. If they came with so much manpower and so many camps it's clear that they have a bigger plan, a bigger action, that will last some time. This platoon was not here randomly. It means that the entrances in the woods are guarded during night and day. We have to leave this place before the hiding posts will be in place. They didn't surrounded us, they have cut our exists. Let's go on the other side. Yes. But in this case we have to lure them here. Let's do it. Water. They are in Valsan. Where we heard the lynx. They have surrounded them. We have to go a chalet, to show ourselves, and to let the impression that we are all there, in order to lure these troops out of the woods. Which is the nearest? The one that is in the valley, isn't it? Yes, from the valley. We go there. Let's go. Valea Chalet August 17th, 1952 Stay where you are. Get out! Get out! We put you on fire. - Out! - Move on. Get out! Hurry up! Hurry up. Take out whatever you have. Put everything here. Nelule, search inside. The boots. Take these. Thank you. Look what I've found. Relu. My name is Ion Gavrila Ogoranu. Tell to the people from the country that there is a corner of the Romanian Kingdom that did not bow his head in front of the Communists. And as long as our heads will be on our necks this corner of the country will be free. Tell them to keep their faith alive that one day the whole Romania will be free. And pray to God so he can help you. And to help us. Let's go. Give way. Come on. Leave everything here. Take just the radio and the food. Let's go. Shh. - Brancoveanu. - Mosu. What are you doing? I didn't think that you will escape. We were lucky. August 19th, 1952 - You were at the chalet? - Who else? How are you? Nelule. Mosule. Let's go to Dridif. - We can hide for awhile to Nicolae. - Let's go. - Do you have something to eat? - Nothing. - Let's go we will reach a stash. - Come on. Were you scared? Hold him. Hold his leg properly. Scissor. - Do you see? - Yes. Keep the light as it is. Good. hamlet from Bolovanu October 7th, 1952 Look at that. Don't move. Pull this. Easy, easy. Easy. That's it. Bring a clean bandage. Come on Gheorghe, fetch a clean bandage. Quick. - In a moment. - He passed out. Do we have another one? Come on, Gheorghe. - Put it in top of it. - That's it. Leave it. Mosule... We cannot continue like this anymore. We have to cross the border, we have to flee to the Serbs. You are talking balls. The Serbs are giving back the Romanians for a rail car of salt. We'll let him like that till tomorrow. Let's clean this. Take those things. - What's wrong with you? - Gheorghe, pay attention. How should I pay attention, why are you picking on me? Gheorghe. Why everybody is picking on me? Gheorghe. Go away from here. Gheorghe, put the weapon down. - Put your weapon down! - I won't. - Put your weapon down! - I won't! I won't! I am afraid. I'm shitting my pants. Why are you looking at me? I cannot stand anymore. I cannot stay in this hamlet, in this rat hole. I'm fed up. Why are you looking at me? Put it down! I am afraid. You are not afraid? I am afraid. I cannot stay anymore in this den. - You are not...? - Gheorghe! Look at me! What happened with you? I can't do it anymore. What happened with you? I am afraid. Sit down. Come on. Sit down. Do you know how it is, Gheorghe? There are many types of fears. The fear of plain areas, when you're surrounded by the Army,... and you don't know if you will survive. The fear of night. when everybody is sleeping and you don't know if the lad that is breathing nearby you will be alive tomorrow. The fear of silence. Yes, I am afraid. Do you know what frightens me? One day, when my child will be grown up, and when the world will be different, cause that day will come, sooner or later, I will have a child, because I want to have a child, he will ask me Father what have you done in those years? And I won't be able to answer. That's scaring me. That's all. toward Manastirii Peak October 29th, 1952 - Hello, uncle Sandu. - Hello, Ghita. - Working, working? - It is possible without the work, lad? What are you doing, uncle Sandu? What can I do? Healthy, full of power. But what are you doing? We came to see you. Are you giving us a truckle? I will give even two. Do not touch the small one. They put me to stir the cheese in front of them with some powders brought by themselves. They gave me even gloves. OK, in that case we will not leave anymore signed notes. Tell them that we robbed you. Yes, yes. You robbed me. And then you go and tell them that we are going on the ridge. OK? But what are doing on the ridge, lads? No, uncle Sandu, we are going downhill, to the village. Aha, OK. Scramble. - Thank you, uncle Sandu. - Bye bye. - I want this hat, cause I see... - Take it and wear it healthy, until it wears off. What? Are we going in the village? No. I told him that because I don't know how much he can resist the interrogation. Let's go to Vasile, maybe we can take some cheese from him, too. Ok, they have taken Vasile, too. Hey, these guys are thinking that we are so stupid? March 6th, 1953 First of all we have to cross the Olt River. To let know to the support people that we are OK. It is very important. - Did Brancoveanu leave a message? - Nope. Listen, why is he travelling so much? What? - He has a girlfriend. - And why is not telling that? Mosule, we need boots. socks, I'm not mentioning food. If we have to a eat a fist of rice like the Chinese we will not take it anymore. This is the ratio. Come on, let's not quarrel. No one is eating more. Then we have potatoes and corn flower and that's all. We cannot take it anymore, Mosule. The pants are ragged, what can I say about the sheepskin coats. Don't worry, for the pants we have blankets. We lay them on the plank, we unstitch them with the pocket knives, we'll manage somehow. I am thinking that we can take wheat and corn from Cristian, from Gura Vaii. Maybe he will give us salt, too. We need chimneys, grill, handsaw, cause this one is broken. And for the clothes we can try at Nelu Cristian. - Which Nelu? - From Ucea. This is exactly what we are going to do. Gelu you are going with Gheorghe toward Obreja, OK? - I will go. - No, no. They know Grigore. That's the plan. You're going to fetch corn and wheat, we're going to get clothes and then we meet here. If one group of another is not coming on time, we are not getting alarmed, OK? We are waiting for news and we will look for notes at each two weeks. Understood? Gelule. - Gelule, what are you doing? - I am doing a mathematical demonstration. Professor, write it down: let it be a right-angle triangle, hypotenuse = 12 cm. - Are you writing? - What? Me? What are you writing there? The same thing: encounters.. Special encounters within the plants and animal world, and meteorological phenomenon in Fagaras Mountains. I saw a black stork. It is something worth writing of? Yes, it is. And the horn-viper and the hart. Mosule. - If I die, give this notebook to Nicu Bocicai. ok? - Yes, Professor. Do you know Nicu? That guy with the girl from Cluj, with the cake. - Have I spoken about it? - No, no, Professor, you haven't. It was three years ago and she had a cake... Leave me alone. Mosule, you don't you write that agronomy handbook? You are laughing as you were stupid. - And that Partisans' handbook... - Oh, yes. I am consulting with Ghita. The partisan Ogoranu. - Why Ogoranu? - Well,... How do you think would sound The partisan Ghita? Quite. Stalin had died. - Stalin had died. - What? Stalin had died. Let us live longer. I was going to cross the Olt river I was going to cross the Olt river With my beloved girlfriend, with my beloved girlfriend With my beloved girlfriend, with my beloved girlfriend But the bridge guardian is asking for one zlot But the bridge guardian is asking for one zlot and to get my beloved girlfriend for ever and to get my beloved girlfriend for ever 4 km away of Obreja village June 3rd, 1953 - Hello. - Hello. Don't be afraid, cause we are not harming you at all. Do you have something to eat with you? We are starving and we are thirsty. We haven't eating anything for two days. Some bread. If you have we will pay for it. There is no need. But you are not going to turn us in to Militia. We trust you. Then we go. We do not want to create problems for you. OK. - We will bring you from the village. - Thank you. - Balan, prepare your men. - Understood. - So you are saying they are on the field? - Yes, chief. - We will take them with their pants' down. - What are going to do with them? - This is not your concern. - Go away. Forward! March! Easy, easy. Gelule. Fire! Shoot. Come on. January 12th, 1954 We camp here. Give it to me, too. It was full of flatbed trucks and Jeeps. The night was illuminated by flare rockets. They shot both of them. First one was Gelu. The second was Gheorghe. Have you learned something else? I saw Maga. He was liberated. He released him. He is a bait. What was he saying? He doesn't want to speak about the prison. That he doesn't have anything to talk about, that we would not understand. That the prison doesn't have any sense. He said that we should thank God that we're defending our freedom with our weapons, and to avoid to fall alive in their hands. And he is laughing all the time. He has changed a lot. What does he know about the others? Marza, Barcutean, Sabadus? Nothing. He said that you don't know even your cell mate. That in the prison your life is worthless. He got married with Mili. The host's daughter from the high-school. You know her. - He told me something else? - To be more cautious. Anyway he has changed a lot. You wouldn't recognize him anymore. - And what else have you done? - We have to go around almost near Olt river. We found notes hidden by Borza and Budac. I read them at matches' light. Thirty flatbed trucks in Arpasel, 30 in Porumbacu, 30 in Cartisoara, 30 in Avrig. To be even for everybody, so nobody would be upset. And they started to fly over with the mosquito. Yes, the things would get more complicated, if they arrived in Avrig. - What are we doing? - What can we do? We go forward. We cannot stop now. Between Avrig and Marsa there are 4 km. We will find a spot. We are staying here another hour and then we leave. OK? 2 km away from Vistea de Jos Here. Stop. Come on. Easy. Take care. Easy. Easy. It hearts, uncle Olimpiule. Put me down. Here. Easy. Go and bring some clothes. The bullet is in the bone. It's shattered. They caught us at the entrance in the village and we've been staying there for two days. - Because I couldn't carry him anymore. - Yes. I want you to know that they asked me to help them. The officers from Securitate came here, too. Only doing so I could escape. Do you trust me anymore? I am sorry that I am creating problems, uncle Olimpiule. If I don't trust you, it means I don't trust anybody. If I die, you should bury me in the yard under the vine, because it's beautiful there and is peace. Hold on lad, you are not going to die now. I am giving him a morphine shot, for the moment. It is bad. I don't think we can do more for him. His leg must be amputated. The wound looks nasty, it's infected. I saw many things in military hospitals. I cannot do anything for him. I am sending my cousin, Gheorghe to Sibiu, to bring Telea, the surgeon. He has to amputate his leg quickly, otherwise he won't make it. I am going to my cousin and I am sending Victor to the Elena Matiasanu - the pharmacist from here. Herself and her husband are my reliable persons. Leule. It's over. It's not over, nothing is over. Yes, it is. Olimpiu Borzea house June 11th, 1955 forest road 8 km East of Plaiul Foii chalet September 2nd, 1955 We camp here. Go and find the stash. What was Fileru saying that's damaged? It's something wrong with the extractor claw. It's cracked. Man, I am so hungry. Shh. The soldiers. Scramble. Reporting. They have arrived in the 8th platoon's perimeter, comrade Major. Fall in! Comrade Major, do you copy? Right! Face! We are spreading them into the woods. At ease! Ten! Hut! At ease! - Get the dogs. - Easy,... - Easy 'cause we are not animals. - Understood. Easy, cause is not an animal. Release the dogs. What have you done? I didn't remember the place. I said to turn back so I won't waste time and I bumped into them. You are so fearsome. - And you didn't bring any food? - If I couldn't find the stash. Let's go. September 27th, 1955 How would be better? To be blind, dumb or deaf? Deaf, definitely. It's better to see and be able to speak. If you are deaf you are dumb, too, because you can't hear what are you speaking. It's not true. You can hear in your head. You can hear yourself. How can you hear, if you are deaf? You are deaf. Nelule, the radio doesn't have batteries, does it? What are we doing, Mosule? First of all we should see all the options. The first one would be to cross the border. Filerule, none of us is keen to go abroad. And how are you thinking? Who will help us? I don't trust even my shirt that is on me. You should talk with Borza, he said that he can speak with Grovu. Didn't he say that he can take us to Greece? I don't know what to say. Rather if we want to have a logical plan, we should find someone who works on a ship or is a border patrolman, someone who has his house on the border. Only in this case it works. I bet that our photos are distributed to all the Militia, waiters, train guards. Gelu and Gheorghe were saying to build a sort of underwater boat. We travel on Mures to Hungary and then to the Serbs. Professor. OK. And then? We cross illegally Yugoslavia till the Austrians. You are not remembering the boat's plans? I'm not doubting the precision of the technical details of this fantastic vehicle. - What? The project? - How and where can we build a boat? Gheorghe has a good friend on Tarnava, in a village. His father has a mechanical shop. He can build us a boat. If they were friends, he is already at the Channel gulag. And how do you think that Security officers will not notice that a boat is built in a yard, when they know how much milk is given by a goat? And having in mind how many ships are, we'll end-up drowned. If you have friends there, let's go there for the winter. Tarnava is not so far. In that case let's go in Bulgaria. The border is less guarded. We are splitting. Netea and Fileru are going on Sercaitei Valley, toward Comis and are going to try to stay at the priest David. Professor and Nelu are going toward Marsa. Because we weren't there too often. Iliu and myself we are going to Grovu. We are taking medications and whatever he can give to us. After that we will go to Olimpiu. We'll see if he knows something about Leu and Brancoveanu. Mosule, what are we doing here? What do you mean? What are we doing? For whom? Who cares? They arresting everybody. No one will give us a single slice of bread. Seriously, now. If I would not knew you I could have said that you are joking. Do you really think they will come back? Realistically, do you think that someone will come back? The Americans, somebody else, I don't know. I think that whatever was to be divided it was divided at Yalta. They decided our faith. Nothing will remain. They will destroy us. But it would be... sad. It seems to me... that we would be too stupid in this case. October 28th, 1956 - It needs more. - What? Sugar. Come on, tell me where is it. - Put more, I want more. - That's enough, glutton. We will put tomorrow, too. Do you want to put is all now? I'm hungry today, not tomorrow. Have you put a nail? Let it boil as it does. Put a nail, do you want to stay here till tomorrow? You are all cooks. All of you are good at it. - If you put a nail inside it will boil faster. - What the hell? - Look. - No, again it will have a rusty taste. - Come on, Nelule. I am hungry. - Nelu. Come on... All of you are good at it. Look, I don't understand something. We are here at Dragus. Last week when we descended to the valley for potatoes, I saw the military here, in Porumbacu. While we were wandering through the village. Before that we had to avoid the Army in Avrig and Arpas. - Correct? - Yep. Let them search for us. What? Maybe they have found a hideout. Come on, the meal is ready. Fire. How many are they? Four. Three. Ghita. Fuck your mother's throat. They followed you? I followed them. Brancoveanu? What are you doing? Are you hit? A little. - Do you have cigarettes? - Yes. Let's go. It was applied a combined plan, by creating a fake gang, for diversion, in order to make contact with Arnautoiu's gang and Ogoranu's gang and only then to pursue to the killing action. November 19th, 1956 But the outcome was negative. The operative combination plan consists of directing a team of locals to gather medicine plants in the area habituated by the gang. These teams are lead by one of our collaborators. Currently the operative group works with an agency of 43 informants, 27 skilled and 16 unskilled. There were trained and inserted 7 armed teams at different works. These teams consists each of two Militia organs, wearing civilian clothes and a qualified informant, they have the task to open fire, whenever the gangs appear nearby. April 18th, 1957 Look at them how are they standing. It's incredible. Topolog Springs 6 km East of Avrig Look at that guy with the coffee. Man, I would beat that guy with the coffee. Do you know how much? He looks like a guy who wanted to take my girl out for a cake. What are we doing? I'm starving to death. - Do we have something left to eat? - Nothing. They are driving me crazy with their biscuits. We pass nearby them or we go on the valley? We're not going nearby them. Sometimes you have such ideas. We're going here to the back. We are going to Racovita to search for food. OK. Professor, look there is a fish. There with the bird in its mouth. Stop messing with that binoculars, let's go. Come on. Hit the ground. Do not shoot anymore. Scramble. Mosule, run. Mosule. Professor. Mosule, run. September 27th, 1957 Take them. On a double. In 1957 the last members of Ogoranu's group were captured. None of them was killed in the ambush. Eight death penalties were decided. On November 14th toward 15th, the executions took place, each at 15 minutes gap. The first executed was Ion Chiujdea aka Professor. It's true that Leu joined back the group, after his unsuccessfully suicide attempt. Nobody knows exactly what happened in the small room of Olimpiu Borzea. In 1976, after 27 years, Ion Gavrila Ogoranu was captured. He had been sentenced to death and life imprisonment, but the crimes were already prescribed. Almost all of Sibiu Security leaders went to the room where Ogoranu was held, in order to see the man who couldn't be captured by them for more than 25 years. After 6 months of interrogation and statements, he was released. He had married in secret with the widow of his good friend, doctor Petru Sabadus, who was killed at Gherla in 1952. Ion Gavrila Ogoranu died 30 years later, in 2006 as a free man. In the battles, in the mountains, we were just injured, but none of us got killed. Killed we were only when we were sold. I am saying with pain in my voice the sell of a brother is a national disease, which will kill us all, if we will not succeed in healing ourselves. We didn't create illusions that many people will join us. Some of them didn't come because they were afraid. They must be understood, too. Others are focused only onto their interests. The regimes are changing, but the profiteers don't. It remains the big mass of those who are working, whose life is reduced to work and food, in an eternal cycle and whose consciousness is not higher than the food plate in front of their mouth. With them the rulers can do whatever they want. First of all, to think instead of their brains. Ion Gavrila Ogoranu Ion Gavrila Ogoranu 1921- 2006 The Fighter's Portrait in his Youth Despite the fact is based on events and happenings partial true, any similarities with persons and / or real events is pure coincidence.
