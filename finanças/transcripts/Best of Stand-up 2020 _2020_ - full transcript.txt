[funky intro playing] [cheering and applause] [Jerry] What is the idea of the buffet? Well, things are bad. How could we make it worse? [laughter] Why don't we put people that already struggling with portion control… [laughter] into some kind of debauched, Caligula food orgy of unlimited human consumption? [laughter, applause] Let's make the entrance a chocolate syrup water park slide. [laughter] The buffet is like taking your dog to Petco and letting your dog do the shopping. You give him your wallet in the parking lot and go, "Why don't you go in, get whatever you think is the right amount of dog food for you? Use your dog judgment. I'm gonna wait in the car. Leave the window open a crack so I can breathe." People do not do well in an unsupervised eating environment. [laughter] Nobody would walk into a restaurant and say, "I'll have a yogurt parfait, spare rib, meat pie, crab leg, four cookies, and an egg white omelet." People are building death-row, last-meal wish lists on these plates. It's like a perfect working model of all their emotional problems and personal difficulties. They just walk around, kind of hold it out. "This is what I'm dealing with. It's a salad with a scoop of ice cream on it. I've got some unresolved issues I'm trying to work out here at the buffet." [laughter] Start accosting strangers. "Excuse me, where did you get that? What is that? I didn't even see that. Is that a caramelized chicken leg? I gotta try that. Gimme yours. You know where they are. You can get more." Come on! [laughter] Twenty-two-year-old prayers, 42-year-old prayers completely different. Twenty-two-year-old prayers be like… "Lord… please don't let me catch any venereal diseases. Thank God for this sweater." [laughter] Forty-two-year-old prayers be like… "Lord… why am I so tired? [laughter] I'm taking the vitamins like you said, Jesus. [laughter] Lord, please don't let him catch any of my venereal diseases. [laughter] And, Lord, please don't let me have to shit right after, Father. It is just-- It's not sexy, Lord!" [laughter] I was on Facebook this week. Just making sure my family's still racist, and… That's a joke. I don't have to check. And… [laughter] I saw that a girl I went to high school with just got back from her honeymoon. And she posted that she's going to be taking a break from social media. Have you guys seen people do this? Yeah, these, like, heroes of the internet? Their big announcement, just, "Hear ye, hear ye! I will be taking a break from social media. #Brave." It's like, "Dude, nobody wanted to see a picture of your sandwich on Wednesday. No one's going to miss it on Friday. All right? Also, why are you posting about the fact you'll stop posting soon? That's like toasting the fact you'll quit drinking. You're not off to a great start, sweetheart. [laughter] This girl made a whole video for Instagram, Facebook, all of 'em. She's like, "Hey, guys, as you probably heard, I just got married. [giggles] And I'll be taking a little bit of a break from social media just to focus on my new wifely duties." [laughter] Wifely duty. I'm like, you can't blow your husband and share cat videos? [laughter] You have two hands. Multitask. Like… Get an apron. [laughter] I thought that was weird, so I played it backwards. Sure enough, she's like, "I've made a huge mistake. Come pick me up. He's so boring!" We're like, "Yeah, we know. We met him." He's the type of guy you get halfway home from the theme park before you're like, "Oh shit, where's Doug? Oh no, we have to go back. My wallet's in his fanny pack, so…" Oh, do not feel bad for Doug. He's terrible. Every time he tells a story, somewhere a child loses a balloon. [laughter] You ever meet somebody, and they're so boring, you feel like they poisoned you? Like, you're talking to them, and you're like, "I feel like I'm dying right now, and I think you did it." This guy's name is Craig. I met him-- I made sure to get it. I was, "I'm gonna remember you for the rest of my life, man." He--I met him at the bank. Is he a bank teller? No. Is he a security guard? Nope. What's his job? I don't know. Whatever they call that guy that stands in the lobby… of banks now, where you walk in, and you’re like, “Do you work here?” And he’s like, “I think so.” That guy. The lobby liaison. Well, I saw him. We made eye contact. I don’t know how you work. For me, if we make eye contact, during the day, not at night, but during the day… [laughter] out of human decency, I acknowledge you. So that’s what I did. We made eye contact, and I go, "How you doing?" And he went… And I was like, "Okay, so…" Then I get to the second set of doors to walk in. And as I reach for that door, I hear, "You going to the bank?" [laughter] I go, "Is this still a bank?" He goes, "Yeah." I go, "I’d like to." And he goes, "Go for it." And I was like… "Okay. Thanks." And then I reach back, and he goes, "I’m going to Virginia next week." "Are you telling me that?" He goes, "You said, 'How you doing?' when you got here. I had to think about it. That's what I'm doing." I go, "That’s the craziest shit I’ve ever heard anybody say, and also not how that question works, but all right." And now I reach back, and he goes, "Yeah, my sister lives there," and I’m like… [laughter] "How long's she lived there?" Now I’m roped in. He goes, "Fifteen years." And I go, "You’ve never been?" And he goes, "Uh-uh." Now I’m starting to look at him like, "Hey, man, do you drive to work, or… does somebody drop you off? You know what I mean?" [laughter] I think he… [laughter] Yeah. I think he could see it in my face, because, out of nowhere, he goes, "I drive." I was like, "That’s cool, man. That’s cool. I drive, too. That’s crazy. Uh… I gotta get in here." He goes, "Yeah, we’re gonna check out DC and see some monuments." I go, "I'd love to hear about it, but I have to make a deposit." He goes, "I’ll be here when you walk out." I go, "You motherfucker." Fuck that guy. And fuck everybody like him. If you have the audacity to tell people how you’re doing when they say, "How you doing," that shit is rude and selfish, all right? I’m serious. There are two acceptable answers to how you doing: Fine and great. And if you’re miserable, you say, "Fine." You don’t burden people with your real-world problems during a courteous exchange. Yeah. [laughter, applause] This is the world that we live in, though. We have to care about everyone’s feelings, everyone’s tolerances, everyone’s intolerances, everyone’s dietary requirements. I’ll tell you where it’s gone too far, and I have to be the person to say this. For the love of God… [breathes heavily] we have got enough milks now. [laughter] Would everyone stop milking shit?! [laughter] I went to buy coffee recently. I have very straightforward coffee tastes. It should have been a very straightforward transaction. It was anything but. I went in there. I was like, "Hello, I’d like a white coffee, please." "Okay sir, what kind of milk would you like with your coffee? We’ve got a coconut milk, an almond nut milk, a hazelnut milk, a cashew nut milk, a macadamia nut milk, we got an oat milk, rice milk, hemp milk, soy milk. You can have it from a bean, a pulse, a nut, a grain, an oat, a flax, a leaf, a seed, a tree." [laughter, applause] "I’d like it from a nipple, please. I don’t care what type of nipple. Preferably a cow’s, but I’m not fussy. I’ll take it from whatever nipple I can get." She looked at me like I had requested it from hers! Like I was the weirdo. I’m not the weirdo! You’re the one in the back of the shop with your little friends, milking fucking cashew nuts. You’re the freaks, not me! I do not, for one moment, doubt that lactose intolerance is a very grave and pressing issue for humanity. But lest I remind you, we currently don’t have a cure for cancer, and there are 12 readily-available milk substitutes on the market which, I would argue, is 11 more than we need! [laughter, applause] Yes, honey. You are somebody else's type. You don't even know that. Like, I realized way too late in life that I am an achievable Beyoncé for government workers. [laughter, applause] Oh my God. Are you serious? Anything like old Black government workers named Lawrence, Dennis, Curtis, Otis, anything in an '-is,' they love me! -[laughter] -[whoops] I can't go to a Veterans Day parade. My booty ain't safe. She is not safe. They lookin' at me like they want me to motorboat the PTSD off their face, and I'll do it 'cause I'm a patriot. Thank you so much. Oh! Thoughts and prayers. Thank you for your service. Thank you so much. I don't know about you, but I can make a government worker work a holiday. That's power, bitch. [laughter, applause] What you do? I'm just saying, you wanna go to the post office with me in December, okay? I’m at home. The phone rings. It’s a school nurse. She goes, "I have Ila in the office. Is there a parent at home?" I was like, "I’ll do." [laughter] Gives the phone to Ila. Her first words, "I tried to stop it, Dad." I go, "Stop what?" She goes, "I got my period." I’m like, "What do you need from me? New pants, new panties, new socks? Did it get in your socks? A bucket, some towels, garlic? We gotta keep the vampires away from you." She’s like, "Dad, I’m fine. Mom gave me a go bag." I go, "Okay then. What're you calling me for?" She goes, "I need you to go to the store and get supplies." I’m like, "How bad is this period?" She’s like, "No, Dad. I’m throwing myself a period party tonight." I’m like, "I’m sorry, what did you just say?" She’s like, "All the girls are doing it. I need you to go to the store and get supplies. Get a red velvet cake." I'm like… [retches] I go, "Baby, I don’t think I can eat a red velvet cake… knowing what it symbolizes." She’s like, "Dad, you need a red velvet cake for a period party 'cause you put the name of your period on the cake." I’m like… "Who names their period?" She’s like, "Georgia named hers after the girl from Progressive auto insurance." [laughter] She’s like, "Please, I need you right now. I have ten people coming tonight." I go, "We have ten little girls coming to the house?" She goes, "No, eight girls, two boys." I’m like, "Who invites boys to a period party?" And I hear her sinister little giggle on the phone, and she goes, "Dad, that’s the fun of it. We don’t tell them why they’re there." [laughter] Now I’m like, "Fuck it. I’m in." I have never had more fun at a party in my entire life. Planning, hosting, and attending a period party. I dressed all in red, like it was Chinese New Year’s. Drinking Pinot noir. I made pasta with chunky marinara sauce. [laughter] And I giggled the whole night with all these little girls at these two boys, Max and Carter, right? Faces covered in red cake, like it’s their honeymoon, and they’re like, "Fuck it. I’ll eat it anyway." [laughter] The whole party, these two boys are looking at the cake, going, "Who the hell’s Jason?" My daughter, Ila Kreischer… named her period Jason because she got it on Friday the 13th. [cheering, applause] For 30 years, I've been going up as Jo Koy. And then, when this last special came out… I had to do press, and they kept interviewing me. And every reporter kept landing on the same question. "Why do you go by Jo Koy?" I was like, "I don't have an answer." [laughter] I go, "That's just what Filipinos do. They name you one thing, and then fucking call you something else." And this is a very true story, 'cause I just found this out, you guys. This happened about four months ago. I went to Vegas, and I took my Auntie Evelyn out to eat. And I just looked at her, and I go, "Look, Auntie Evelyn, a lot of reporters are asking me where I got my nickname, and I don't have a story. So can you just tell me a story? Why you came up with the nickname Jo Koy?" She's really old. You gotta understand. And she looked at me and went like this. She goes… "I don't call you Jo Koy." [laughter] And then I was like, "Oh my God, she's old. She's--she's losing it. She's losing it." So I felt bad. I went like this. I go, "Auntie, no, it's-- it's me. It's me. I'm Jo Koy. I'm--I'm Jo Koy. I'm Jo Koy, your favorite-- your favorite nephew. I'm--I'm Jo Koy." And then she goes, "I know who you are. I'm not stupid. [laughter, applause] I'm just telling you I don't call you Jo Koy." I go, "What're you talking about, you don't call me Jo Koy? Like… Are you fucking with me right now? Like… Are you being serious right now? Thirty years, I've been going by Jo Koy. You never said anything." She's like, "Yeah, I never said anything, because you keep saying, 'Jo Koy,' so I just let you say it." "For 30 years, you let me say, 'Jo Koy,' but you don't call me Jo Koy? I could've sworn that day when I was at the house, you said, 'Jo Koy, eat.' And I was like, 'Jo Koy, that's my nickname.' Are you serious right now?" "Yeah, I don't call you Jo Koy." "Then what do you… Then what do you call me?" It's a true story, you guys. You ready for this shit? It's gonna fucking make you cry. I swear I just found this shit out. I go, "Then what do you call me?" She goes, "I call you Jo Ko. That is your nickname, Jo Ko." And for all of you at home that don't know what that means, in Tagalog, ko means my. My nickname is My Jo. Jo Ko. How fucking sweet is that? That's so sweet. I had no idea. I go, "That is the sweetest nickname." She goes, "You're the one that keeps saying fucking Jo Koy. I don't know who the fuck that is. Every Netflix special, 'Coming to the stage, Jo Koy.' I'm like, 'Who the fuck is that? That's Jo Ko!' That's Jo Ko.'" Why didn't she tell me this 30 years ago? All my merchandise, misspelled. 'Cause Black people don't pick up shit. You don't know the last time you picked up some shit. Black people don't pick up no shit. You better hope it rain. That's the only way that shit getting off that block. If it don't rain, the whole neighborhood going to be shitty. White people love to pick up shit. You motherfuckers love to pick up shit. White people can't wait to pick up shit. They go shopping for shit bags. Them blue bags. They read the box and shit. "Biodegradable. Environmentally-friendly." They can't wait to-- They got the little pouch to put to put the shit bag. They got the shit bag fuckin' purse. They can't wait to rip off a sheet. You probably got some blue sheets in your pocket right now. They can't wait to be like: Fu-fow! Fwow! You know how much pressure it is, being walked by a white dog owner? You can't just enjoy your walk. You got to shit immediately. It ain't no, "Sit, Bruno." It's like, "Shit, Bruno!" You know how stressed out that dog is? He can't-- You know that mother like this, "Here come this motherfucker with these--" 'Cause once a dog do this move right here, ain't no coming back. Ain't no-- A human can't come back from this shit. Try to fight somebody, and you gotta shit, it's over. "I'll kick your--" Oh, oh, oh, oh! White people have them blue bags. Fa fa fa, fwow! Ah! "Fuckin' yes, Bruno! Fuckin' yes! Great stool, Bruno! Good job!" [inhales, shouts] They put it in their pocket and walk away. Black people don't pick up no shit. Ever see a Black person walk they dog? The dog starts to shit, they act like they don't even know the dog no more. They like, "Oh, nah, you shitting? Nah. I'm getting out of here. You gonna get us locked up, motherfucker. You better do this shit right here. [laughs] That's the-- You better remember this shit, motherfucker." That's the only way the shit getting off of here. I don't understand what's going on with the whole lotion thing with women. Right? I-- Okay, I've lived with six girlfriends in my life. In my in my life, I've lived with six women, and all six of them have left me. [laughter] And sooner or later, I'm going to blame myself. But not today. [laughter, applause] Now… Now, every single woman I've ever lived with have a nighttime ritual where they-- See, I have a bedtime ritual. What I do is go to the bathroom, have a piss, brush my teeth, go to bed. I've recently figured out that I could do them at the same time. I have a piss, and I brush me teeth, and I spit over, like that. Now, but the thing with women is you all go into the bathroom for, like, twenty minutes, and you close the door, and then you come out, and the last thing you do is you sort of-- you're rubbing something here, and then you go like this, and then you get into bed and tell me what I've done wrong that day. And that's your little nighttime routine. Now, I don't know what goes on in that room, but I assume, I can't be positive, but I assume you were covering your body, head to toe, in some type of lotion that you think is vital for your existence. Now, I'm 42 years old. Umm…I wear makeup for work. When I'm on TV, they put makeup on me. I never even wipe it off. I just fuckin'-- They give me a towelette, and I go, "Oh, don't worry about it." It goes away over a week, and they put it back on, and… Apart from that, I've worn sunscreen. But I've never put anything else on my face, nothing else my entire life. Umm, I'm arguably an alcoholic. I used to be a heavy smoker. I've been a cocaine addict. -[whooping] -[laughter] And my skin is fuckin' flawless. [laughter] I can't stand it when you cum in my mouth, and then you stop watching my Instagram Story the next day. Why'd you drop off? You watched it before. What happened? Oh, is there anything more pathetic the next day, when you're trying to wait for that guy to watch your Story again, and you post one? You're like, "Hey, guys." But you're really being like, "Hey guy, that I'm waiting to watch this." And you, like, touch your mouth to remind him where his dick was hours before. And you're like, "Oh, hey." And then you're just refreshing, waiting for him, and then your dad DM's you, like, "Killing it, Nick." And you're just like, "Not now, Dad! God. [laughter] He's like, "What'd you have for breakfast?" And I'm like, "Do you really want to know, Dad? An ounce of cum and a half a KIND Bar. Okay? That is exactly… A KIND Bar and a mean load, Dad. What flavor? Mixed nuts. What else, Dad?" I'm just… I just want to be a whore, I really do. I am such a whore, but outside of a relationship, I don't feel safe being a whore. I really don't, and for a while I was like, "Oh, maybe if I don't have sex or let them in my puss, I won't get attached. Maybe if I just blow guys." So, I was blowing guys, and that's not safe either, girls. There's something about their dick. It's closer to your heart or something. It's just-- It-- [laughter] I go crazy. Handjobs. Handjobs are all I have to get a guy off? No, thank you. I'm terrible at handjobs. I'm bad at handjobs and guitar. I know that about myself. I have bad rhythm. It's-- I wanna be good at guitar so bad. I've taken so many lessons, and every guitar lesson has gone like every handjob I've ever given. It has. I'm in a guy's studio apartment. He's showing me a strumming pattern. I feel like I'm doing a good job, and eventually he's like, "Let's do it together." I'm like, "Okay." And we're doing it together. I'm like, "All right, we're jammin'." Then he's like, "Why don't you watch me?" I'm like, "I'm out. I don't care. I'm not good at this. So I'm gonna wait for my mom to pick me up." And then he cums on me. 'Cause that's how I used to pay for my guitar lessons. That was before Venmo. It was a different time. In the Latino community, we don't want to live forever. We're not trying to make sure that everything we eat is good for us. We know-- Listen… You go to a Mexican restaurant, you already know that we cook with fucking manteca. Look at us. [laughter] We fuck obesity up. By the third grade, we already said goodbye. "See you later, obesity. Fuck, I passed you." And then little Latinos are all fat, you know. You try to make 'em feel better. You’re like, "Mira, mijo, you were-- You were going to be twins. That’s why you’re, you know. You don’t hear a voice telling you you’re full? No? You might listen. Might be your sister trying to tell you." Bigger chichis than everybody in the family at 11. "Hey, Tetas, come out here." That’s how you get your nickname. You shit in your pants one time, you’re Caca for the rest of your life. You could be a grown man, fucking Caca. "Hey, guess who’s getting married." "Who?" "Caca." "Fuck! Caca’s getting married?" "And his wife is pregnant." "Chingado! They’re gonna have fuckin' cacitas running around. Caca’s getting married, huh? Shit. Fucking Caca. Good for Caca." We don't know. Our parents-- Shit. We were raised by the original body-shamers. They didn’t give a fuck what age you were. They’d be leaving for work, "Hey, you two fat fuckers right there. You better not be on that couch when I get home, Gordo One and fuckin'gGordo Two. You hear me?" We would answer, "Yeah." "All right. Fucking clean yourselves. C'mon." [laughter] This nigga Elon Musk be goin' to space by hisself. What the fuck is that white man doin' in space alone? That’s not suspicious to anybody but me? This motherfucker goes to space without the government, without NASA? Which I didn’t even know you could fucking do! As far as I knew, they were the space niggas. They run space! You wanna fuck with space, you gotta fuck with them. This motherfucker built a spaceship like it’s a go-kart. Goes on Tuesdays. Bitch, space day is Saturday! Everybody know that! You can’t leave midweek to go to goddamn space! It’s an event. It happens Saturday. The TV’s on. This nigga be going Wednesday night. What? From Sacramento, at that. Bitch, space place is Cape Canaveral. That’s where you go from. Ain’t no entry point to Mars from fuckin' Sacramento. [laughter] [laughs] When you goin' to space, you at least tell the people. It’s a PSA. Get on the goddamn news. Say, "Hey, I'm about to fuck around in space. Don’t be alarmed." This nigga just went. We thought it was aliens. Aliens? No, it's just Elon doin' donuts in the sky. What the fuck is this? [laughter, applause] White man ambition is some shit. You wanna know where the racism is? That’s where the fuck it is: White men. I know y’all still confused. Look at him. "What are you talking about?" Fuckin' confused. 'Cause they don’t get-- Everyone learns the history. So you’re like, "No one’s getting hung, and we ain’t beating nobody. I work next to a Black guy, and he has a car, so equality." Just lay the fuck down. Rest easy. "Everything’s fair." Fuckin' nutjob! Everything’s not fair! 'Cause while you’re sleepin', you’re dreaming about buying Mars, nigga! [laughter] [scoffs] I never thought I could do shit like that. I thought about having all the money. I thought, "If I get all the money, I’ll buy them gold ceilings Master P had in Cribs. That's… That’s what the fuck Imma do when I get all the goddamn money." Space by my goddamn self, bitch? Never! Even if I thought about going to space, I’d call NASA first. "Yo, NASA, this Sam. Can I go? You know what? It is Tuesday. Space day is Saturday." [laughter] You never know when someone’s gonna dump some shit into your head that’s gonna ruin your life, or at least change it for months, or just cause you trouble. And it could be just in passing, somebody just drops shit into your head, and you have to deal with it. Like, you could just be having a day, and somebody you know or don’t know that well goes, "You taking turmeric?" "What?" "Turmeric, are you taking it?" "Turmeric?" "Yeah, you gotta take that shit." "Turmeric?" "Yup." "The spice?" "Yeah, you gotta take it." "Turmeric, the spice?" "Yeah, man, you gotta take that." "Th--The spice that you buy once to make an Indian recipe… and you never use it again, and it stains your wooden spoon, that turmeric?" "Yeah, you got to take that shit." As he’s walking away, he’s like, "Oh yeah, if you’re gonna get turmeric, make sure you get it with black pepper in it, or it won’t activate." Now, right there, doesn’t that make you go, "That sounds like bullshit to me a little bit? Am I that big of a sucker you think I would believe that?" Where’s the science on that? That sounds like a couple of vitamin hustlers sitting over a mound of wholesale turmeric with a bunch of empty gel caps, one guy going, "I don’t know, man. I don’t think we can move this just like this. It's just a spice. I think we gotta-- We gotta add something." "Yeah, like what, boss?" I don’t know why it’s a '30s movie. "I don’t know, maybe another spice?" "Yeah, like what? Maybe pepper?" "Yeah, keep talking." "Maybe we say it activates it?" "Holy shit! That's a fuckin' million-dollar idea, right there. Let’s load up these gel caps. Maybe Rogan'll move 'em on his podcast." [laughter] I don't feel like my kids' private school respects my level of celebrity. I don't. I really don't. I mean this. I swear to God. I'm not playing. I'm gonna be very honest. It's my fucking household. I'm not holding back. They don't respect my level of celebrity! I'm a very humble guy. [laughter] May not seem like it after that sentence, but I am. I'm a very humble guy. What's understood doesn't need to be said. You know who I am, and I know you know who the fuck I am. Don't make me say who I am. They put me in a position to have to say who I am. I go drop my kids off at the school. Teachers come running out, surround my car. "Mr. Hart, we'd love to talk to you for a second. The big fair is coming up. We do this fair once a year at the school. We would love it if you would be the greeter at this year's fair." [laughter, appaluse] I gave her a lot of time for her to say, "I'm bullshittin'." She never said it. I said, "Are you fucking kidding me?" "No. It's our biggest fair. We'd love it if you'd be the greeter. We think you would make an amazing greeter at this year's fair." Before I go on with this joke, I wanna make this perfectly clear. First things first, I have nothing against greeters, okay? I don't wanna tell this joke and walk outside my house, and there's a group of ya'll with signs talking about Cancel Kevin Hart 'cause he don't respect greeters. "Cancel Kevin Hart because he don't respect the greet." Greeters are amazing people. The job is actually required. I get it. I've actually been hit with some amazing greetings in my time. I want to Walmart. I got hit with a greeting so fucking fantastic one time. I don't even know where he came from. He just slid in my POV. I walked in. He was like, "Welcome to Walmart. You here to get you some stuff?" I was like, "What the fuck. Where did you come from, man?" He's like, "You better get you some stuff. We rolling back prices." Then he moonwalked. He just moonwalked out the way. I said, "What the fuck just happened? What just happened here?" I was so blown away by the greeting, not only did I go get me some stuff, I broke my neck looking for this guy on the way out. I want him to see my stuff. "Hey! Come here, man. Hey! Come here. I wanna show you my stuff!" He came over. I opened my bag. He was like, "Oh!" [laughter] He said, "Oh!" "You got you some good stuff." Took out his highlighter, swiped my receipt so people knew I didn't steal. He said, "Make sure you come and see me again." I said, "Will you be here?" He said, "If I'm not, who will?" Moonwalked out the way again. I said, "What the fuck?!" That was one of the best goddamn greetings I've ever seen, man. "Of course Imma come back and see you again." I'm not shittin' on greeters. I'm just saying I didn't have to go that route. I went around that to get to my success. You don't come to me and ask me to be a fuckin' greeter. I had a number one movie in the box office at the time. I was on the side of fuckin' buses. You don't ask me to be the greeter. There's other parents who got kids who go there that are former actors and actresses that you could've fuckin' asked. Carlton from The Fresh Prince, Alfonso, that's your greeter. This right here, that's who you want at the front. That's your greeter. Terry Crews, he got kids that go there. That's your greeter. Pec-popping at the front. [repeating] "Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Welcome to the fair. Who want a ticket? Hey, hey, hey, hey." What a combination. Parents would've went crazy. "Whoa! What a school! I want tickets. I'm going to buy every ticket I can." [repeating] "Hey!" Parents would be blown away. "These greeters are amazing." [laughter] And at the beginning, we all had one password. It was our first password. We can nostalgically remember. And we used it for everything. Every time we joined another business. "Can I have your password?" "Yes, you can. That is my special word." And then, companies started getting quite rude. You would put your password in, and it would go, "Weak." "Who are you to judge my special word?" [laughter] They're like, "Sorry, but the internet has become popular. We need to strengthen your password." And businesses would insist, "We must have from you a capital letter. I'm sorry, we will not be accepting passwords anymore unless it contains at least one capital letter." And we all momentarily considered our options before deciding to capitalize the first letter of our password. And for a period of time, that was fine. But the internet became even more popular. And then businesses started saying, "I'm afraid you cannot join unless you have at least one capital letter and at least one number!" Again, less than half a micro-second's consideration, before we collectively decided you shall be getting the number one, and that will be at the end of my now capitalized password. And for a period of time, this was acceptable until a whole new, unexpected, and exciting dawn emerged, a world of special characters. We didn't even know what they were. And businesses would say, "We need a capital letter, we need a number, but we will also require a special character." And we clicked on the button. "Please, can I have some examples of these special characters which you now insist upon?" And we perused them. "There they are. I had no idea these characters were so special." Until all of our eyes stopped upon the exclamation mark. [laughter, applause] "You're coming with me." Which we then put at the end of our now capitalized password, just after the "one." And it's at this moment that everybody at the London Palladium is thinking, "I should probably change my password. I'm probably going to do that tomorrow. Or do that now." [laughter] Growing up in the South, we love two things, and that was church and Chili's. Everybody in the South goes to church. There's one on every corner. They even try to fool you with churches. Like right now, you think you're in a theater. [laughter, applause] But the reward for going to church is that then you get to go to Chili's. And Chili's, in my hometown, was the fanciest restaurant. It was so fancy, I referred to it as Chilé's. Now, I grew up Methodist, which is considered Christian light. Yeah. Just a little dab will do you. Just boop! Just a little bit of Jesus, that's all you need. All we cared about was that the preacher was done with his sermon by noon so we could beat the Baptists to the Chili's. Right? [laughter, applause] It'd be 11:55, and if the preacher was still yammering on, you could hear the choir slowly start singing. [to "Amazing Grace"] ♪ Baby back ribs ♪ ♪ How sweet the sauce ♪ We're like, "Preacher! Wrap it up!" [laughter] I have good news. I finally smoked weed with my mom. Did it. Took me 36 years of campaigning. Finally did it. Now, keep in mind, my mom is a 700-year-old Jew, okay? Wasn't easy. No, she came to my house, we were in Los Angeles, and I'm driving around with my mom, and I go, "Smoke pot with me." And she goes, "No. It's illegal." I go, "No, it's not. It's legal now." And she goes, "Oh, okay." I swear to God, it was that easy. So we went to my house, and I'm trying to smoke a bowl with her, and she can't inhale. She looks like Dizzy Gillespie the whole time. Like… [blows raspberries] So I give her a little weed cookie, and then we start playing Scrabble, and then 20 or 30 minutes later, her eyes got all red, and she looks up at me and goes, "My mouth is dry. Is that part of the appeal?" And then she snapped. She was like, "Bring it in. Bill Cosby didn't do it. I did it!" And I haven't seen her since. -[laughter] -[Eric laughs] By the way, Bill Cosby is guest bartending tonight if you guys want some really strong drinks! [whoops] I saw a great documentary on Ted Bundy. Did anybody see that? It was a four-hour, four-part Ted Bundy documentary. And they said, originally, he wanted to be an attorney or a politician. When I heard that, the whole thing kind of made sense. Like, all right. He actually took the more admirable route. I've seen about 30 documentaries on Ted Bundy, and I gotta be honest, I'm a little sick and tired of the hero-worship we have of serial killers in this country. And I say we, 'cause I've been guilty of it too. But you can tell it's more than just curiosity and voyeurism. It's admiration. You can tell by the language used in the documentaries. They don't talk about Ted Bundy the way they should talk about him. If they were speaking about him honestly, every sentence would start with, "And then, this piece of shit…" [laughter, applause] But they don't do that. They give the obligatory, "He was wicked. He was evil." But then they find almost admirable qualities, and they harp on them. First of all, his intellect. They can't stop talking about his intellect, which was overrated. He was not that bright. They're like, "Ted Bundy was so intelligent. He escaped from jail twice." You know how he escaped from jail the first time? The window was open, and he jumped out. [laughter] That's how a cat or bird would escape from prison. You're not a mastermind if you're in jail and see an open window, and you're like, "Freedom is that way!" They called him a genius because I think they like the idea of the wicked genius. They said, "Ted Bundy was a genius. He acted as his own attorney." They executed him. He sucked as a lawyer. You're not a genius if you get the worst-- He couldn't have done worse. If he had hired an orangutan to represent him, and it just shit in its own hand and mushed it in the face of the jury, it would have gotten the same sentence Ted got making an effort. [laughter, applause] And collectively, can we agree, stop harping on his appearance? He was an average-looking guy, but they can't stop talking about, "Oh my God, he was charming. Ted Bundy was so handsome." No, he wasn't. He was handsome in that pool of people. Okay? In the group of men who have murdered and raped 40 or more women… Ted's a catch. I'm married. I have a white wife and a white son-- white stepson. Blonde hair, blue eyes. Little white son. I've been raising him since he was two years old. We call him Miklo, yes. Miklo. But he thinks he's Mexican too, now! He be steppin' up to fools, "What's up, fool? You fucking with la raza?" I'm like, "Hey, calm down, Scott. That's the condo association. Don't fuck around." White boys are down, though. When you have a white boy who's the fuck in your gang, he's down. White boys are crazy, man. They come up with fucking crimes that we could never think of. One time, this white cholo comes up to me. "What's up, homie? You want to do a home invasion, bitch?" I'm like, "Fuck. Who's house, Ryan?" "My mom's house. [laughter, applause] That bitch didn't want to make me a sandwich last night." You get proud of your stepson when he does stuff, even though I don't help him do anything. I'm always right there, "Yeah, you know, I'm his only father." But if my son becomes a serial killer or a school shooter, Imma be like, "Hey bro, you fuckin' know how fucking white people are, bro.. I was scared for my life! One time, he dressed up like a ghost. I didn't know if he was a ghost or a fucking KKK member." [laughter, applause] There are still a lot of Greeks alive and thriving in the world today. Hello and welcome. No, just the ancient Greeks. They are all dead. They lived on a busy road that was built by the ancient Romans. Now, who have we got here? We've got Pythagoras. He's busy naming all the triangles! That's a cute one. Then you've got Socrates here. He took a bit of a tumble. Classic Socrates. Good with the thoughts, shit with the walk. Get up, mate. Arugula? What were the women doing while all the men were doing the important naming of all the things? From my research, what I gather, women were generally standing around in groups of three, naked, just waiting for men to name all of the things. You see it happening with this central figure. She's saying, "What have you got in your hand there, Karen?" [laughter] "Just a couple of bits and bobs." Women were just holding things. Just waiting, hoping it wasn't poisonous. Waiting for men to name the things. This was painted before beds were named. You can see women desperately trying to make the beds, just flinging the linen into the trees willy-nilly. Just going, "I don't know. Let's just build a fort. We'll make it a fancy fort!" "Yay! We finished the fort!" Dancing naked in groups of three in the forest is the number one hobby of women of all time. And don't we just love it? Isn't that the safest thing you've ever heard of? Love it. Now this might just look like a footloose, fancy-free frolic in the forest on a bank holiday, no drama. But let me draw your attention to this grip here. That is too tight for fun times alone. It suggests tension. What has happened? Has someone mentioned the paleo? No. What has happened is this central figure, here, has realized that this bit of cloth, this waft of gauze, this potential fort, if you will, has made its way so far up her clacker… so far up her clacker, it had both fannies covered. And she is upset! Now, it's worth pointing out at this juncture that this is not a photograph. This is not an accidental photograph… taken of an unfortunate moment. Awkward. No. What this is, is a painting. Which makes this… a decision! It's a decision. One a man made and spent time on. [laughter] Oh my God! [whoops] That's what I do now, by the way. I hike. It's my thing now. I hike. Hiking is not my exercise. It's my activity. Because hiking is not an exercise. It's the segue between the actual exercise you did in your 20s and 30s and then the gentle mall walking you're going to do… in your 70s and 80s so that you'll fit into the tuxedo at the funeral home. 'Cause you don't want 'em splitting the back of the jacket open. That's embarrassing. Come on. Let's die with some dignity. So what I do every day, I park my car at the base of a hiking trail. Then, I walk away from my car… until I eventually turn around and walk back to my car. And that's-- That's what I do. There I am, out there with all the other 50-year olds. Doing our little doom ovals. And if you were to fly a helicopter low over the Earth, you know what you would see? You'd see people in their 20s gobbling drugs, eating delicious food, having sex. People in their 30s, with actual jobs, making the world run. People in their 40s… tying to fuck the 20-year olds. [laughter] And then us, the gentle, surrendered 50-year olds, on our little futility ovals. We've got our earbuds in, listening to podcasts… which are done by 20-year olds that nobody wants to fuck. [laughter] If we're going to understand our country, we have to understand our beliefs. -Do you agree? -[audience] Yes. Right? And what we must understand is that they are not true, but we really fucking believe them. For instance, all Indians must stand for the national anthem. I believe it. But, technically, we don't have to. Probably should. Safety issue. [laughter] Because there are dudes multitasking in the room, singing while whooping ass. [sings indistinctly and shouts] So stand for the national anthem, man. It's pretty chilled out, our national anthem. Like, a definitive end. It's not too long. You know when it's over. We all just kind of go… [sings indistinctly] Hey! Nobody died. Okay, sit down. [laughs] These guys never know when to sit down. ♪ For the land of the free ♪ ♪ And the home of the ♪ ♪ Bra-ee-a-ee-a ♪ ♪ Ee-ave ♪ [laughter] That football player who took a knee wasn't protesting. He was just resting. We don't have to stand for the national anthem. Do you know how I know? The announcement says, "Please. Please stand for the national anthem." In standard Indian rules, if the announcement says please, we don't do that shit. "Please wait 'til your plane has reached the gate before you use your cell phone." Fuck off! We are in the air, we see a building we recognize, we'll start trying to call people, right? "Please don't piss on the wall." That's what walls are for. America should be very grateful they share a border with Mexico, not us. Because, you know… If it was us, and they built a wall, they'd have a very different problem on their hands. [Donald Trump voice] "Why do they keep pissing on us?" You're picturing that now, aren't you? [laughs] [laughter, applause] Young people love to kiss. They suck each other's tongues. I saw this young couple in an elevator just making out. Didn't care that we were in the elevator. Sucking each other like licorice. [kisses] Then he stuck his finger down her throat. Right? He just stuck it--[moans] And she started sucking it like it was a penis. If I tried to stick my finger in my wife's mouth, she'd be like, "What the-- What the fuck was that? Are you mad at me? What the fuck did I do? You don't want to listen to me, tell me to shut the fuck up. Don't do that. You just scratched your nuts for a half hour on the couch watching the game. Alls I taste is mushrooms. I hate mushrooms. Fuckin' truffle-nuts. Leave me alone." Yeah, around 45, you stop kissing. That's when you're like-- [kisses] "Hi. Goodbye." Yeah, because he has a dead tooth, and you don't have dental. "Let's not do that anymore. How's that?" [laughter, applause] Now there are things that we do that we think we're nailing, and we're not. Like thongs, jandals, flip-flops, plakkies. That's what we call them in South Africa. You know, we will never have world peace unless we can agree on a name for these shoes. Now, the thing with those shoes, they don't come with instructions. The thing is, they really should. 'Cause I never owned a pair 'cause I grew up on a farm in South Africa where we have snakes, and scorpions, and shit. So you can't have any of that. So the first time I ever bought a pair was when I was in my mid-30s, 13 years ago in New Zealand. And no one stopped me. Like, I bought them. No one, as I got to the door, went, "Hey… have you used those before?" You go, "No, I haven't." "Come here. Hey, just so you know, if a drop of moisture get on the inside of that shoe, you're dead. Oh, and if a drop of moisture gets on the outside of that shoe, [laughs] you're dead. Oh, and don't think, for a second, that you can run… from your car, during a thunderstorm… into the mall where they've gone ahead and tiled it. Because, whether you're physically prepared or not, you're going to do the full fucking splits." And you're like, "Okay. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Cool." And as you walk out, they go, "Oh, one more thing. Just so you know, those shoes, they're only for forward motion. We call them one-directional. Yeah. You wanna take a step to the side? You're dead. You wanna take a step back? My uncle tried that. He's dead!" Those shoes are so complex, man. They should come with a warning and someone to live with you for, like, a week after you buy them. And I learned that I'm officially at the age-weight ratio where I no longer fall over. I had a fall. You don't know when it will happen to you. Even five years ago, my friends would've gone, "Were you drunk?" [laughs] Now, I get all these concerned emojis. "Mate, are you all right? I believe you had a fall." I'm like, "No, bitch, I was wearing my death booties. I forgot." [laughter] [Tom] These are the good times. People talk about the good old days all the time, right, lately? "What if we just go back to the good old days?" "The good old days." Are you kidding me? These are the good old days. The good old days? We're just figuring out how to do stuff now. And we don't even have it figured out, yet. You wanna go to the good old days? They didn't know how to do anything there. Nothing! You ever see the first bicycle ever made? I don't know how to make anything. But I know you don't take the smallest wheel you can find and put that in the back… and the biggest wheel on earth and put that up front. [laughter] It's a bad bike. You couldn't even get in the seat by yourself. Your friends had to fling you up there by the ends of your handlebar mustache and hope you landed on the seat. And once you started peddling, you couldn't stop. You peddled 'til you died. And that was okay, 'cause your life expectancy in the good old days? Twenty-eight years old! Please. A horrible time to live. Hospitals were a nightmare. All they did was cut your leg off. Didn't matter what you had. Broken arm? The flu? You walked in, you hopped back out. No medicine. No medicine. No Advil. Could you imagine? A life without Advil. Oh! Ever go to the cabinet and realize you're out of Advil? Ah! I just lay on the ground and hope to die. What're you gonna take? That 12-year-old Benadryl from the back? They had no TUMS. No TUMS! You ate, got gassy and exploded. These are the good old days. Look at all your outfits. Look at these beautiful fabrics you're wearing. And I know you had options. This isn't your only outfit. No, not in the good old days. One hard, woolen outfit. Hard leather shoes made out of pig livers. And burlap underpants. Burlap underpants. Ever see black-and-white pictures from back then? They're all angry, just staring at the camera. Like, "What's wrong with those people? Why were they so unhappy?" Burlap underpants. Awful. [laughter, applause] Come home, start playing video games. Grand Theft Auto 3. [cheering] Fans of GTA. First time in a video game you could do anything you felt like. You can do whatever the fuck. Go steal guns. Steal a car. No worries. Can run over people. The police comes. You can kill the police. Then they send the army, which you can also kill. And if, in the middle of that, by mistake, if you die, you are just alive again. In the hospital, but without guns. Go back to stealing guns. But it was too much freedom for my mentality at the time. "You can do anything." "Yes, but what are you supposed to do?" "Anything! Go wild." "Yes, but what is the objective?" I looked it up and found out exactly the shit you needed to do. Did all that, finished the game. End of the game, you get statistics, which is how many times you've died, how many people you've killed, and a very interesting thing called completion percentage. And it said, "Completion percentage, 12%." Huh? I finished the game. That's a 100%. No, no no. You've just reached the ending. But you only did 12% of all the things you could've done. Well, fuck! What if life is like that? What if you die and go to the afterlife, and they give you a report card? "Three percent?" "You didn't do any of the side missions." "Like-- like what?" "Like, see here at a party? Someone gave you a joint. You said, 'No, thanks.' Fifteen percent." "All right, then." "You loved someone. You wanted to tell them. Instead, you said, 'Ah! Bye. It was a dare!'" It wasn't a dare. [laughter] [chuckles] My granddaddy used to love to watch wrestling. He had this thing about Black wrestlers beating the shit out of white wrestlers. Like, like Thunderbolt Patterson? He would scream at the TV when Thunderbolt Patterson was beating the shit out of somebody white. "Kill that cracker!" And I'd be sitting next to him, "Kill that cracker!" I had no fucking clue you white people was supposed to be crackers. So when I got older, I wanted to go see a match on my own, y'all. So I'm at--I'm at Peachtree downtown. [chuckles] I go--I go to this-- I'm on my way to the wrestling match, and I stop at a Marriott hotel to call my brother, like, "Hurry the fuck up. We gonna miss the goddamn match." He's like, "I'm on my way." So, I hang up the phone, but I look up, and this white man is staring at me. He was like, "Hey, how you doing?" I'm like, "Hey, how you doing?" He was like, "You wanna go to my room with me?" I'm like, "Okay." [laughter] I ain't never been to a Marriott hotel before. Especially not in their room. He opened the door, y'all, and the first thing I noticed, he had fuckin' air conditioning. We didn't have that when we were coming up. We had that one fan that my momma kept in front of her pussy, and it blew her pussy all through the house all day. Like, "Can someone tell momma her pussy stank today?" He go over to the little refrigerator in the hotel room. He opened the door, ya'll, and he gave me a real Coca-Cola. At this time in my life, I had never had a real Coca-Cola. Colas, and maybe Kool-Aid, but not Coca-Cola. I was so fucking excited, I popped that shit, and I drunk it in one swallow. He walked me over to the bed. He don't say shit. He just unzipped his pants and take out his white dick. And I had never seen a white dick before, ya'll. And white dicks look like an uncooked chicken leg to me. [screaming, laughter] [laughs] Look at all the white dudes, like, "What the fuck's she talking about?" [laughs] And he wrapped my hand around. He made me go up and down and up and down. And I'm thinking to myself, "Is this how white people barbecue? 'Cause this chicken leg needs some fucking seasoning salt." About five minutes in, something came out of the chicken leg, y'all. So he took it out of my hand, and he wiped my hand off, and he gave me $100. I'm like, "Sir, are you gon to be here tomorrow?" [laughter] That was a lot of fuckin' money for an 11-year old. [groaning] Oh, fuck you, white people! That's more money than your lemonade stands ever fuckin' made. You ain't never made that kind of money at your shitty-ass lemonade stand. Fuck ya'll. That white man was creating jobs in the Black community. [laughter] I like people in their 20s and 30s. They just don't get it yet. People in their 20s and 30s, "Let's get fucked up! You want to get fucked up? Yeah! Let's get fucked up!" No, I don't want to get fucked up. I don't. No, it's not fun. I'm in my 50s. I only feel good, like, two days a month. [laughter] Why would I want to fuck up one of those? If I wanna get fucked up at my age, I'll eat some cheese, you know? [laughter, applause] [retches] [groans] What kind of cheese was that? Camembert with truffle flakes? All right, it was worth it. But fuck. I'm fucked up now. My wife, for Christmas, she got me a gym membership. "Thank you, honey. Oh, thank you." I know. I went over there, and I saw these old guys. They were working out. And um, they were ripped. But it looks weird, you know? I don't wanna get ripped, you know? I just don't wanna look like a complete piece of shit. You know? That's the goal. Give me that personal trainer. The not complete piece of shit personal trainer. So I'm looking at these old guys, and they're, like, ripped, you know? But it looked weird. Something was off. I was like, "What, is it the--" Then I figured it out. You're not supposed to be ripped when you're old. 'Cause your skin gets stretched too thin. It's like, "Look how ripped I am." "Yeah, but I can see your heart. Put on your shirt. You're grossing me out." But uh, my favorite part of being married is my wife deciding what I don't need anymore, you know? [in Mexican accent] "This doesn't fit. This looks like shit. Can't wear this." She's not Mexican. It's just more fun to do that voice. [laughs] More fun. More fun. She could be Mexican. I'm not sure. I have my suspicions. I'm not 100% sure. "You don't wear this anymore. This doesn't fit anymore." My wife threw away all my sweatpants. Threw it away. -"Why'd you throw away all my sweatpants?" -"Because sweatpants, they lie to you. They are liars, the sweatpants. You don't know how fat you're getting. You don't know. 'Til one day, both strings just disappear. Then you are a fat fuck. It's too late. I threw them away." She's right, though. Let me tell you, if you're in your 50s, and you're a guy, it's dangerous wearing sweatpants. It is. It's dangerous. Because it's way too easy to just whip out your dick. I found myself whipping out my dick. I wasn't even halfway to the bathroom. And then I get distracted by something. Then I hear my wife yelling, "What are you doing with your dick out? You're not even in the bathroom yet." I was like, "Hey… I didn't even realize the Olive Garden had a salad bar." [laughter] I don't know. I'm not a good feminist, though. I'm still listening to R. Kelly. I kind of forgot how good that music was 'til that documentary came out. People are freaking out. Like, "What are we gonna do with his music?" I'm like, "Look, obviously, I'm not gonna support anything new that he puts out. Unless it's great." [chuckles] Honestly, though, all his old music, that's all grandfathered in. Look, if you're not listening to that music, it's like he fucked those kids for nothing. [audience groaning] Hey guys, look, you… [laughs] You may not support the war, but you always support the soldiers. [cheering] Oh man! Those girls served this country. [laughs] Yeah, I think they should have the same rights as veterans. They should be able to go to school for free, board the plane first. Why are we letting your grandmothers board the plane first? They've done nothing for us. Those girls are the reason why we have the remix to "Ignition." [cheering, laughter] Oh, man. Did you watch the documentary, though? [audience] Yeah! I didn't know he was having sex with kids and keeping them in his house. You're like, "Kelly, catch and release. You can't have the whole JV basketball team in your basement." They're like, "We're losing a lot of games. Where are the point guards?" I don't know. I think he was just having sex with kids 'cause they were at the same reading level. Look, I don't care if you guys laugh at that or not. [laughs] I was ignored my whole childhood. Yeah. I would've loved to have been at R. Kelly's house. Oh my God. There would've been so many kids to play with. Oh man. What a sick game of tag that would have been. [laughs] I don't know though, R. Kelly's a guy that put out a song called "I Believe I Can Fly." Like, if he thought he could fly, he definitely thought he could fuck some kids and get away with it. The harmonium. [mimics explosion] It just appeared! [laughs] Oh man. The harmonium is such a depressing instrument. And you can't hate it also. It looks like an old uncle with asthma. [coughs] The guitar's like a young teenager. Like, "Yeah, let's do drugs, bro. Come on." Harmonium is like, "If you can just drop me to the temple…" [audience cheers] It's the first time someone got excited… by seeing someone approach a harmonium. That never-- It's usually the soundtrack of a funeral. The harmonium is great. It doesn't need electricity, by the way, to run. It's eco-friendly, so… It's also poverty-proof. You can't complain to the government. You can't be like, "We can't pursue arts 'cause there's no electricity at home." The government is like, "Harmonium." Western instruments use electricity, like electric guitar, electric piano. "Ma'am, can I use an electric guitar?" She said, "No. You'll get shocked." What? And uh, it's--it's also very interesting how it's made. It's made out of wood and depression. So-- And it's the only instrument which sounds like the word "no." Like it's "no" in every scale. So I used to ask my teacher, "Can I play the guitar today?" She used to be like… [long note plays] [laughter, applause] How can anything good come from that? And not just in English, in any language. Like… ♪ Nahi ♪ It's amazing. I could start crying, and you would not make out the difference. ♪ Nahi ♪ [sobbing] "What an alap!" No, he's crying. He's crying. -Will we disappoint you? -Who knows?
