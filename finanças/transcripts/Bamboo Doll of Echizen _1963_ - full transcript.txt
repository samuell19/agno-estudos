An Entry of the 1963 Arts Festival In the domain of Echizen, 8 leagues from the town of Takefu on the river Hino... Deep in the mountains, lies a tiny hamlet called Takegami. There are just 17 or 18 houses in this forgotten and forlorn place. The reason it gets mentioned by people these days is as a source of bamboo craftsmanship. THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOWA PERIOD (1926/1927) (Buddhist chanting) Kisuke's father really was an exacting craftsman. It's a pity, now there's no true master left in the hamlet. Yep. Kisuke, you're 21 now, you can't remain a kid forever. You need to put your energy into your work and become as good as your father. OK? Yes. Time to be off. If we don't have a drink we'll never warm up. Too true! Please accept this... Eh? (Priest chants) It's snowing really heavily. Thanks again. BAMBOO DOLL OF ECHIZEN A Masaichi Nagata Production Script by Ryozo Kasahara Original story by Tsutomu Minakami Photography by Kazuo Miyagawa Music by Sei Ikeno Film Editing by Shigeo Nishida Starring Ayako Wakao Junichiro Yamashita Tamao Nakamura Ganjiro Nakamura Ko Nishimura Jun Hamamura, Saburo Date, Taiji Tonoyama Directed by Kozaburo Yoshimura Excuse me. Yes? Is this the house of Kizaemon Uji? Yes, it is... come in. Thank you. Are you his son? Yes. Oh... I was much obliged to your father. I heard he'd passed away and came to pay my respects. Err... may I ask your name? May you?... It's hardly worth mentioning. Where is the grave? Please come in. Thank you. So may I... Of course. Please don't trouble yourself on my account. Here you are. Thank you. Where have you come from? Kyoto? Or from Tsuruga? From Awara. From Awara? Well... All the way from Awara! Why won't you tell me your name? As to that I... My name is Tamae. You're called Kisuke aren't you? - Yes. Your father often spoke about you. - About me? - Yes. Your father was a really nice man. He would always drop in and see me when he went to Awara. Really? Thank you. Thank you. I feel better now. You were most kind. Not at all. Thank you. I'll take my leave. Thank you for coming. Goodbye. Won't you come in just for a moment? Thank you but no. I have to catch the train. I'll walk with you. No thank you. I know the way well. Well... goodbye. Thank you. Tamae? Tamae from Awara? My name is Tamae - from Awara. Your father was very kind to me. So that's 30 yen and fifty sen. All correct. You made all these yourself? Without help? Yes I did. You can tell you're Kizaemon's son! Tamae! Tamae! Yes? What is it? You don't need to ask that. Tea, tea for the guest. Yes. Can I ask a question? If you go to Awara do you have to change at Karatsu? You take a train from Fukui towards Mikuni and Awara is the 5th or 6th stop. I see. Are you staying in Awara tonight? I'm not sure. There's a pleasure quarter so you'd best be careful. You don't want to blow your winter earnings. No... no, I'd never do that. I want to visit a friend of my late father. AWARA Welcome! Thank you. What would you like? Eh?... Oh. Err... Ah... a bowl of rice and egg. OK. One rice and egg. Here you are. Thank you. Hey, I'm trying to find somebody, can I ask you? Yes? Someone called Tamae. I know she's from Awara but that's all. Just Tamae? Don't you have a family name? No, I don't. No, I just know she's called Tamae. Sorry, no idea! Hey... someone from Sanchome perhaps? Ah, yes, Sanchome... Sanchome? The licensed quarter. Oh! The licensed quarter. Hello handsome... Hi fella. Coming in? Hi. Are you coming in? Whatever are you thinking? Well, sweetheart? Are you coming inside? No. Is there a girl working here called Tamae? Umm... that must be o-Tama at Hanamiya, right? Right. Where's Hanamiya? About 5 houses along from the next intersection. It's on the left. Thanks. You're welcome. Come on inside... come on. Oh, no. I'm terrible sorry. Did I get you wet? I'll make it up to you. Come inside for a minute. No. Well you're going to go inside one of these places, aren't you? Umm... is a woman called Tamae here? Yes, I think she is. Could you tell her Kisuke from Takegami is here. Tamae's not working at the moment. Really? Yes, she's been in bed with a bad cold. She's ill? Yes. Well... can I just pop in to wish her well? If you say it's Kisuke from Takegami she'll know who it is. Very well. Weelll... OK, come in. - Alright. Please. Just wait here please. Alright. This way. I'll let her know you're here. Oh, it's you! Come on up. OK. You did well to find me. Yes, I've been asking here and there... - Is it only you? - Yes. Come up, please... - Please come upstairs. - Right. Thank you for coming. Please go on up, if you will. I'll come again. - Oh, please do. Please, this way! Yes. Take care. It's a bit cramped but please come in. Alright. Thank you. I'm sorry it's so much trouble. Not at all. Have you been sick in bed for long? Since New Year. Since New Year? It got into my chest. I had to see a doctor and take lots of medication. Oh... So it was straight after you came to pay your respects? Well yes, I suppose it was. You must have caught a cold from walking through all that snow. I was all right when I got to Takebu, but on the train I started to shiver... Then, around New Year, I developed a cough. So that's what did it! It was coming to the house that caused it. No, no. It was I who decided to come and pray at the grave. What's that? Eh? Oh that... It's well made, isn't it? Yeah, that's what I thought when I saw it. Can I have a look? Please do so. Oh... Where's it from? Who do you think made it? Who? Your father. What? Yes, you father made it. Dad did this? Yes. Here you are. Thank you. He gave it to me five years ago, just after I first came here. Your father was really sweet to me. He made that doll specially for me. Do you remember your father making it? No, I don't. Oh, I see. This doll is called Kottai-san. Kottai-san? Yes, a courtesan. When I talked about the time I was living in Shimabara he said he'd make me a doll. He said I would be like the great courtesans in Shimabara and he made it for me. Tamae, why did you come from Kyoto to here? Well... there were various reasons... What about your mother and father? They died when I was little. I don't remember their faces. My aunt took me in but... when I was 19 I went to work in Shimabara. Five years ago my aunt got ill and it was really expensive. So I moved here. I was invited by o-Mitsu. Ah, you just met her. Uhuh. Surely Kyoto is better than out here in the country? Wherever you live is home. Awara is a good place. After all, I met your father, who was so nice, because I came here, right. I'll be going. You're going already? I just wanted to thank you for coming to visit the grave. I hope you get better soon. Thank you. Take care of yourself. - Please wear this. - No, it's fine. But... Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye. Kisuke! Take care. It's been raining heavily every day. Yes - the rainy season should have ended by now, right. You should both come again next Sunday. - Let's have a kiss... - No! There's no time. There will be no 'next Sunday' ... You must come again. Let me go or my army sword will rust... - Don't go straying elsewhere! - Mm. Thanks for everything. Well done you worked hard! Hello. I'd like to see Tamae for a short time.. Yes? Please, I'd like to see Tamae. Ah, you've finally come! Yes. I'm Kisuke from Takegami. - Please do come in. - Alright. You're Kizaemon's son, aren't you? Yes. I knew your father well. He treated me to dinner a few times... and gave me some money. I see. Please, is Tamae there? Well yes... but she's got a customer who's stayed overnight... A customer? What about her illness? Well... since you came last time she's gotten better really quickly. Could you call her - just for a moment... Sorry, she's with one of her regulars... Oh... I see... Not just an ordinary regular either... He may be going to redeem her contract. 'Redeem'? Ah... a customer pays money and takes her away. He gets her to stop working... You mean she's going to get married? Married! Not quite... You're quite innocent, aren't you? Because we've worked in this sort of place... Although it's comfort services, men don't think to marry us... So what will happen if she stops working? Well... err... this customer is talking about opening a small restaurant for her. So he's making her his mistress? For women like us escaping from the trade like this, this is our dream. I see. Has she agreed to this? Not totally yet. How much will it take to redeem her? Eh? Well, let me see... she's got extra debts because she's been ill so... The year starts from October so... maybe 150 yen. 150 yen! Were you thinking of redeeming her contract? No, I just... Are you going? Yes. That's too bad. I'll tell Tamae you came. OK. Err... These are just some eggs and beans but could you give them to Tamae, please. It's too kind of you... It's fine. Goodbye. Hey! Aren't you finished yet? Get on with it! OK, OK. It's you! If you please. - Is Tamae in her room? - Yes. Sister? Please go in. - Well, well. Please come in. - Do go in. He said he has to talk to you about something, alone... I see. Keep the Madam away for me, OK? Leave it to me. Take your time. Don't tell Madam about that visitor. - Right. Are you finished? What? Still not finished cleaning? Aren't the rooms done yet? You're hopeless... Madam! Madam! Come here. It was horrible. Horrible. Eh? What? It's terrible... A big rat! A rat? What rat? It was there until a moment ago - yugh! I'm sorry to receive you in this state. Feel free. Thank you. It's been a while. It's so kind of you to take the trouble to come so many times. Not at all. Thanks to you I'm able to be up and about now. I... umm... I've brought 150 yen. You can pay off your debts. And perhaps you'd come to live with me. Huh? Since I first met you I've not been able to get you out of my mind... Will you come to Takegami? To your house? I... Do you want me to be your wife? No, you don't have to, but... If you keep taking customers every day your health will get worse and... You'll end up killing yourself. Coming to my place will be better. Please come. Kisuke, I'm delighted with your offer... But I can't answer you now, just like that. Why not? Well as to why not I... For now anyway, please put this money away. I cannot accept it now. So... It's that regular customer I suppose... You'll get him to redeem you and go to him, will you? I've made no such agreement with any client. But I heard... There are some customers who say that sort of thing to try and get attention. We don't believe they're serious. So then you will... No, I can hardly take the money and come straight to you. But I... Please let me think carefully. The year ends in October... I will pay my debts and come to Takegami to reply. There are a lot of things I need to do. Even if I agree, I can't just drop everything and fly off like a bird! Very well. The 6th of November will be Father's anniversary. So you'll come with your reply by then? Yes. Definitely? Hey! Kisuke! Kisuke! Listen, Kisuke... I was working in the corner of the north field... I saw a woman visitor, coming on a cart... A woman? I don't know her, but young. With a cart loaded with stuff... Is that the wife you were talking about? Are you sure? Yes. Go and look for yourself. Right! Oh. What the... Hey! Hey! Oi! Thank you! Tamae! I'm glad you've come! I'm sorry I delayed. But I've made up my mind so please let me stay. I've waited a long time. What a surprise. So it's your bride, eh? Then I deserve a special extra payment, don't I? He's really an awful singer. Watch your footing. - Yes. Tamae, from now on, use this room as yours. It's a nice relaxing room. - My mother used to sleep here. - Ah. Where do you usually sleep? I'll be on that side. Oh... It's sort of a storeroom. I see. Finally, it's just the two of us... Yeah. Sit down. I'll make tea. Err... Tamae... Listen... Can you lend me this from today? What for? Starting today, I'm going to make dolls. Oh. I'll make them better than my father did. Please feel free then. Thank you. In which case... I've made the tea. - Thanks. Just put it there. - OK. Here you are. Thank you. - Shall we go to bed? - Right. Leave the work now and come to bed. You go ahead and sleep. I have... I still want to do something. I see. Well, good night then. Please stop that. Good morning. If I allow you to do the kitchen work I won't understand why I'm here. I do it every day. I'll cook the rice. You go and sit down. Alright then, please. The Miso soup is here. OK. The pickled vegetables are in that pot. I'm just going to prepare for work. I'll be back in a moment. Please do. I'll prepare here. Right. Here you are. Ah. Thank you. Thank you for the food. Don't be so formal. We'll be doing this every day from now on. Please, relax. OK. What's the matter? It's salty. Oh no. What shall we do? Dilute it a bit with hot water. I haven't cooked since I was a kid. I'll do it from now on. No, that would be a waste. It's so burnt! Please forgive me. I like it like this. Really? Stay still. Just a moment... What was that for? A large mosquito. They're still around. Oh. You gave me a shock. Sorry! Kisuke! It's already 1 o'clock. You need to go to bed. - Mmm. Ah, you're still awake... Yes. Kisuke... Please tell me the truth. My being here is a problem for you, isn't it? Eh? You dislike me because I'm a woman from THAT place, don't you? No. No. Tamae, I like you. I don't dislike you. But it's been five days since I arrived... Kisuke... I came here as your wife. I know. I understand but... But please leave me alone for a little bit longer... I... when I see you here moving about the house cleaning... or just standing or walking around it makes me pleased. You're my reason for living. Please be patient and stay just as you are. Please don't hate me. Tamae, I beg you. All right. I understand. Will you stay? OK. If that's really how you feel. I will wait. I'm still not a proper wife - my cooking and cleaning aren't good enough. If I don't work hard and improve... I can't really complain, can I? That's not really the case but... Yet it's lonely, sleeping on my own behind that door. From tonight can you at least sleep in the room next to me? I will. Really? Yes. OK. I'll keep the door open. You're sure? Yes. Right. - Ah, Tamae... - Eh? Look at this. The appearance of the doll... do you recognise it? I'm not sure... This is how you you looked when you first came to the house. No way! I'll show you I can make something better than my father's one. OK. I'll look forward to that. Good night. Good night. Hi. Ah, hello Sir! You're full of energy! Have you got much stuff ready for me? Yes, I was going to come in 2 or 3 days. Don't worry. I'm not here to press you. I had a couple of places to visit and thought I'd come by. It's been a while! I see. Oh, is this your wife? Yes. This is the master of the wholesale shop in Takeyu. Pleased to meet you. My husband is much obliged for your help. Not at all. You're a lucky guy. Where did you find such a beautiful wife? Through a friend in town. Please, come inside. - Please. Please. - OK. - Please. - Thank you. It's only simple bancha, here you are. That's fine. Thank you. I've done all these. Mm, you've done well for such a short time. - Right. - Eh? What's that one? Can I look at that doll? This one? This is really great. Did you make both of these? No. That is one my father made. So this one is yours? Yes. In any case, please take a seat. Go ahead. It's really well made. But look... - Ah. ...especially as... yours is so much better made... Is that so? By the way... how about putting it in the folk craft exhibition? - This doll? The folk craft exhibition? - Mmm. The Prefectural authorities are holding one at the next trade fair in Fukui. This would be well received. BAMBOO DOLL BY KISUKE UJI GOLD PRIZE I have an art and craft shop near Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto. Yes, he's very well known. Really, your work is impressive. I travel a lot but it's the first time I've seen such a beautifully made bamboo doll. Truly. I was really impressed. So I wonder if I can have some to sell in the shop... As Echizen Dolls, a craft product. How about it? Oh! It would be an honour. This is quite a success. Yes, but... I can't make very many of them. I understand. The best dolls are limited in number. As with pottery, and even lacquer-ware, a master craftsman doesn't create many pieces. The fewer there are the higher the price. I'll send my head clerk to come and collect them. Sorry to keep you waiting. I really wanted to see you and, as my husband was coming to Fukui, I came as well. Is that so? Sister, I thought I'd never see you again. Up in the mountains there's no one to talk with... Day after day... it's really lonely. What are you talking about? With that nice young husband it must be great. He's not a talker. And he's a bit strange as well. What do you mean by 'strange'? As it's you, I suppose I can tell you, right? Since I arrived he... he's not treated me as a wife. Eh? What do you mean? We sleep separately... and he's not yet so much as held my hand! Wow. And you've said nothing? No, of course I asked him how he feels! And? No change. He likes you, doesn't he? Well he SAYS so... - Sister? - Eh? I have a feeling that I understand how Kisuke feels. Oh? Kisuke was brought up alone since childhood by his father, yes? He must have had a much deeper relationship with his father than usual. Well, yes, I suppose so. Naturally, when you've had a relationship with his father for five years... He can't suddenly treat you as his wife. Could something like that really be the issue? I'm sure it is. If that's so then he and I will never become a real couple, eh? Don't assume that. Kisuke really does like you - and you like him too. - You really think it will be OK? - Thanks. It's not an opinion. It will definitely be OK. You need to pull yourself together. You telling me that has really cheered me up. This, like everything, is about getting the ambience right. It also needs time. Exactly. Look it's snowing. I thought the snow was finished? I wonder if it'll be deep. I'm only going to the wholesaler so I'll be back by 7. - Come back as early as you can. - OK. It's unusual for you to buy sake. Is there something to celebrate? Eh? Yes, a customer is coming from Kyoto. Wow, from Kyoto? I was going to cook boiled carp. Do you think I can get one? Hmm... a carp? I'll ask. Yes, please do. You're coping well, living in this lonely place after the excitement of town, eh. My husband and I are both impressed. You're young yet have no chance to wear make up... It's no big deal. Hello? Anyone home? Yes. I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. I'm from Heikodo shop. Thank you for coming. - My god! - Eh? Oh! It's you! Sonoko? Yes... it's Mr. Sakiyama, isn't it! That's right, Sonoko. What a surprise to find you living here. It must be fate! It must be. - I work as head clerk for Heikodo. - Is that so? The master has sent me to buy bamboo dolls. - I see. - Where's your husband? He's gone to Takefu and won't be back until tonight. He's travelled to collect goods from a customer. I see. He's out. That's inconvenient. So it's your husband who makes the bamboo dolls? Yes, he's made some... there's about five left. Right. But I can't give you any if he's not here. My husband asked me to get you to wait. Then is it OK if I do that? Of course. Please come in. Thank you. - Please, do come over here. - Please don't trouble yourself. But it's so surprising to find you here. It must be fate. Ah... this is really great. Here, this one's hot. - Thank you. Excuse me. - Eh? How old are you now? Me? I'm 29 now. - 29? - Yes. You've really not changed. You still look young. No, surely not. - You have one too. - Not for me thanks. Come on. It's fine. We're old friends, aren't we? How old are you? - Me? - Yes. I'm 40 now. I quit the former shop and settled in as head clerk at Heikodo. The master really likes me and I'm getting the hang of how the business works. - May I? - Help yourself. I can't quit looking for pleasure though. It's pretty tough on the recruits - as usual. And I have to come to distant places like this - that's part of the job. By the way... How's your aunt? She's still in Shimabara. - Shimabara? - Yes. I was there a while ago but... She was the one who... Yes, she was the one - very dodgy! Dodgy? She's your own flesh and blood... Let's not speak of it. So anyway, how about another drink? Thanks. After you quit Shimabara, what did you do? You've been here since then? No, I lived in Awara. Doing what? The same as before, obviously! A geisha who can act... Hmm. But I moved and had a lot of debt so... I couldn't carry on a respectable trade even though I wanted to. Oh, I see. So was it at work then - love at first sight? Well sort of, I grew to like him. Oh... I see. He's a lucky guy - having a beauty like you fall in love with him. You're too kind... thanks. By the way Sonoko... Are you... Hoi, that mole here... Does your husband know it? Well... perhaps. I remember it. You still have it of course? I liked it. Silly! I want you to show me. No, don't be foolish. Why not? Don't be so cold towards me. No. Sonoko... Come on, you haven't forgotten we slept together? Stop that. Come on, Sonoko. Us meeting here. It means something, doesn't it? Sonoko... No, no, please endure it. I don't like... please, stop. Sonoko! Come on, Sonoko. Nobody's watching... all right? If we say nothing, nobody'll know, right? OK? C'mon, be nice. Listen, I'll never tell anyone, OK?... OK?... Sonoko? No, please no... Tamae? I'm home. Coming. Welcome back. I got the orders. I'm going to be busy. They want 50! Really? That's good. I brought some yakisoba. Thank you. By the way, did the clerk from Heikodo come? Yes... he did. Oh?... Where was he heading? He's going to stay at the Yanagiya Inn. He said he'd come again tomorrow. OK. Then I'll go and take the dolls to him there tomorrow. I don't know him and it's the first time he's come all this way. I shouldn't have been away when he came. I'll take them and apologise. I'll go to bed now, get up early and be off. Have you eaten? Not yet... Hey, could you heat the yakisoba for me?... Please? Yes. I'll tidy up. Kisuke? Kisuke! You... Sorry, I'm cold. Please let me in. No. No. What are you doing? Oh come on. You know. Why do you run away? Come to me. I... I... I'm scared. Why?... Why? Am I so frightening? Why is it like this all the time? Please tell me. I'm your wife. Hey, Kisuke? You're my mother. Eh? I... I have lived till now, always thinking so. Please permit me to. Your mother! Go back there and sleep. I... I want to continue to think of you as my mother... And continue to live with you like this. Please. I beg you. Go back to your room. Oi!... Oww... Idiot! Why did you do that? Can I have two stamps? - Ordinary ones? - Yes. That sleep felt so good! You send a lot of letters. Business must be booming. Is it from your good customer in Kyoto again? It'd be better if you didn't ask all these questions! Hey? That Kisuke is really in a foul mood these days. He is. Please take a break. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Come on... - Come on. Thank you so much, Tamae. Not at all. Tamae, thanks for your trouble... your face is looking thinner recently. Is that so? Maybe a dislike of summer causing weight loss? But I'm eating lots. Hey Tamae, you always have to run around after us, maybe it's worn you out! You've been married for nine months now... Don't make any bad jokes! Oi, you've gotta bow down to her for the tea... then just drink it! - Welcome back. - Hi. Hey, you are supposed to be our apprentices... You shouldn't call her Tamae-san - it's not formal enough! Sorry. Saburo! Yes? Did you make this? Yes. This isn't good enough. Do it again. Are you already asleep? What's the matter? Noth... nothing. What's this commotion now? You'd better stop please. You don't normally drink, do you? Leave me alone. So very, very drunk... why do you have to drink like this? Sorry. Will he be OK? Mmm, if I leave him a while he'll wake up. Thanks. Kisuke? Yes? Here... some water. It will help you recover. Thanks. Can't be helped, just part of being human. Here... here... Here... What's this? Money. For this will you let me stay tonight? Err... You want to play with me? I... Look here... You're really out of control. Why? Idiot... You have only just secured such a good wife... So why are you playing in a place like this? You're not the type that comes to such a place for affairs, right? If you've so much free time you should be home early cuddling up real close with Tamae. I'm a man. I do as I please. That's not right. I've been close to Tamae since she came from Shimabara. We're like sisters. Even if it is "work" I would never betray her. OK. If you won't, I'll go elsewhere. No way. I'll go along and make sure no place will let you in. Why? Why would you do that? Kisuke... I know I'm interfering but... You haven't had sex with Tamae yet, have you? I was right. Of course. You're hung up about your father and Tamae, aren't you? Don't... I can remember... Five years ago, when your father first came as Tamae's customer... Even when your father stayed here... he never slept in her bed - not even once. What? We all slept in a huddle together so I know better than anyone... He treated her like a daughter. He was just fond of her. So that's how it was... That's how it was, eh?... It's the truth. I swear it. o-Mitsu... I'm sorry. I... I'm going home. You understand? Yes. Thank goodness. Ha, that's great, go make Tamae happy. I will. I'm home. It's me. It's Kisuke. OK. Welcome home. I'm sorry I disappeared without saying anything. Where have you been? I err... I walked all night, back from Takefu. Again? What for? I got the urge to see you and I couldn't wait... Well... You must be exhausted! No. Look, Tamae... - Eh? I've thought a lot and... and I realised I've been doing something wrong to you. Wrong? Yes. Look, Tamae... Yes? Will you be my real wife from today? Wow... Is that really what you've grown to desire? Yes. I... I love you. I love you. I love you too. I really do. Just a moment... What's the matter? - I feel really sick... - Eh? How are you feeling? OK? Yes, OK. A lot better. Thanks. You were quite fragile after that last illness. You must be careful. If I rest today I'll definitely be better. No, you should see the doctor. There's a good doctor in Takefu. It's just 2 hours on the cart... It's not that serious I... No, I'll go borrow the cart from Choshichi... Just a minute. No I... Please stop the cart. Stop! What's up? I'm OK. Just feeling a bit sick... Kisuke told me to be especially careful. Wow, it's hot. Place her on a drip. - Right. - Anaesthetic. - OK. 200 millilitres. Madam... it's not a serious problem. Don't worry. It's something to celebrate. - Eh? From what you said it's just at 4 months. The baby's developing nicely. Oh... I see... - Next!... - Yes... - Come in please. Look after yourself. Take the medication too. Come in. That's it... come in... this way. Thank you. Mrs. Sakamoto? Yes. Please take care. Thank you. Excuse me, but... - Yes? - A quick question... - Yes? What is it? Um, when a mother's not very strong physically... I've heard that abortion is permitted... Only in extreme cases. You've got some lung scarring but... But nothing that will hinder giving birth normally. Well... But... Aborting mid-term for no medical reason... it's a serious criminal offence. The doctor would lose his license. He'd also go to prison. There's no going back afterwards. Don't brood over things. Have your baby. OK. Thanks. Welcome back. Well... What did the doctor say? It's nothing serious. It's just some stomach trouble. Oh, stomach trouble. I'd just let it go too long. - That's why my stomach is so delicate. - Be careful. I was told to eat rice porridge and be careful of other things... Good. Here you are. Thank you for taking the trouble. See you then. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Kisuke... Yes? Actually... The doctor told me... It would be terrible if it was a cancer so... So he said I should go to a big hospital and get a check up. Why didn't you tell me straight away? I didn't want you to worry unnecessarily. Also, I know a doctor at the university hospital in Kyoto... I thought I'd go and see him. That's a great idea. You'd better set off tomorrow. - Yes. Shall I come with you? No it's fine. I can go on my own. I'm a bit worried so I'd rather... Really, please don't be concerned. It's a two or three day trip - no big deal. I'll drop in at Heikodo while I'm in Kyoto. Just to say hello. Really? HEIKODO KYOTO DOLLS BY FAMOUS MAKERS Excuse me... Yes? Is Mr. Sakiyama here? Yes, he is. Then perhaps you could... OK, I'll call him for you. Well well... Sonoko. Long time no see. This is unusual. You've travelled a long way. Well, I have a favour to ask of you. What is it? What makes you ask so formally? I can't tell you here. Is there an inn nearby that you know? - An inn? - Yes. - Hang on a moment. - OK. Don't bother. I'll do that. Very well. It's a nice quiet place, isn't it? Yes. I'll have to go after lunch but you can stay and relax. Shall we have a drink? Thank you. So, is there something urgent? I need a favour from you. What favour? Well... - Enjoy your stay. - Thanks. I'm a bit scared as to what it might be... Mr. Sakiyama... Yes? I... I'm pregnant. It's the 4th month. Really? Congratulations. But... the baby I'm carrying is yours. What? What on earth are you talking about? There's no way I'll believe that. Look... I only slept with you the once... You're Kisuke's wife, aren't you? What are you saying? This is ridiculous. Mr. Sakiyama... I have never slept with Kisuke. Since I've been in Takegami... There's only been you. It's the truth. Really it is. So you've never slept with Kisuke... Why might that be? Are you certain it's mine? Certain? I'm the woman and I should know! Please believe me. I'm not asking you to take responsibility. I have money saved from when I worked in Awara. I brought it with me. I want you to take me to a doctor... And help me get an abortion. What? There are lots of doctors in Kyoto. There must be one you know well. Please take me to him. I won't tell anyone. That's what I came to ask you. Please help me. I'm not happy about this. I beg you Mr. Sakiyama. I've thought about suicide frequently. See, what you've asked... I don't know any midwives or doctors... But you believe me, don't you? You're the only one I slept with. That day... If only I'd been stronger, this wouldn't have happened. Honestly, that day... I'd lived for so long as if my body was only the shell of a woman... and I became suddenly lonely. I was a wicked woman and now there is the punishment. Hey!... Hey, how about asking your auntie in Shimabara? I haven't seen her for some time. We don't even exchange letters. I see. I beg you. Please help me. Mmm!... Well... It's a bit too bright. The situation... I understand entirely. Leave it to me. I'll sort something out. Eh?... Really? Yep. There are lots of doctors in the city. I'll start looking around tomorrow. Thank you. Don't worry. We'll get something sorted out. Look Sonoko, it's not just this but... - Eh? But I really do like you a lot. No! What are you doing? Don't be stupid. It's not stupid. I've not been able to stop thinking about you since that day... You don't mind, do you? Don't cry out! Sonoko! Come on... come. St... stop it! St... stop it!... St... Beast! You're a brute with a human face. I'm not asking you for anything! Wait, Sonoko. Ah... your auntie... she's not in Shimabara any more. Oh no! Where is she? Well, at the end of last year I heard that she'd gone to the Hashimoto licensed district. Hashimoto... Yes. Is that so? Thank you. Excuse me for troubling you. Thank you. Thank you. It'll be 3 sen. Oh, THAT auntie... Yes, she quit here last month. I don't know where she went. I see. She's definitely not in Hashimoto any more though! Thank you. You've been very kind. Are you feeling unwell? No. It's fine. Thank you. Hello? Yes, this is the inspections office. Yes... yes... what? Yes. She looks really ill. Yes, she does. OK. Time to go. Spread that cushion for yourself. Have you been to Hashimoto? Yes. What's the matter? Belly pain? - Yes. Shit, it's serious. Come on. Show me. It hurts. This is bad. But OK... Poor girl, I'll untie your obi. It's OK. It's OK. Kisuke! Kisuke! Kisuke! Are you conscious? Good. I'm glad. Listen, girl... The baby... It's not inside you any more. What? It's gone down the river. The river? It's nobody's fault. The baby's destiny was not here in this world. I'm so sorry for the trouble. Please forgive me. This is for the best. I did think for a moment of showing you the baby... But if anyone else had seen it you'd have trouble... I decided to let the river take it. Nobody knows. Nobody saw. The water here is deep and flows swiftly. The baby went quickly with the water. Thank you. I'm so grateful to you. You don't need to thank me. More importantly come to the hut and rest. Your body needs rest. Kisuke? Kisuke? Ah! Tamae? Tamae? Kisuke. Tamae! What on earth happened to you? Come inside. You've been overexerting yourself. Are you all right? It's fine. It's just that the train journey took so long... I see. You're exhausted. I'll make your bed up. Just a second. I'm sorry. I thought you might be back today. There's still work to finish but I sent the apprentices home early. I see. What about your stomach problem? Well... for some reason... when I went to the hospital today... it got better. There's nothing to worry about. What's the matter? I think something must have happened to you. You've got no bag... No, nothing happened. I left my bag with auntie. Well I suppose it's OK then... I'm so happy. ...to come back home here. I'm so glad. I'm a happy wife. Good. Now you need to rest. Thank you. Kisuke? Yes? What is it? Us! From now on for us... Everything will be good. I think we can live happily. Yes. Everything will be better. I'm so happy... so happy. Good. I've still got some work to finish. I won't be long. Kisuke? Yes, I'm just coming. What's up? Are you feeling sick again? Tamae! What's the matter? Tamae! You mustn't die! You mustn't die! Tamae! Don't die. Please don't die! After the death of his wife Tamae, the doll maker Kisuke Uji... completely abandoned doll making. He spent a few months in a daze... And then one evening in late autumn... he took his own young life. If you go to the mountains and visit the hamlet of Takegami now... Kisuke's house has rotted away... leaving no trace save for the clay pipes. And all around their graves, which the villagers will show you... there's nothing but a grove of bamboo trees, swaying in the wind. KISUKE UJI. TAMAE UJI. THE END
