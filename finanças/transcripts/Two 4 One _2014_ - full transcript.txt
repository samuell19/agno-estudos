So where am I going? Ah, king size. Your problem is you've only got five inches. Uh-huh. Which is actually not a problem. It just means that your mattress is not considered defective as per the manufacturer's warranty. Well, when does it become a problem? When you've got, uh, eight to ten inches. Oh. Yeah, you know, four or five is considered normal. It's a little disappointing, I guess, but it's normal. Well, what do I do? It's too mushy. Well, um... do you mind if I say something a little personal? No. I think if you stick to the middle of the bed, you'll find it's a lot more firm. How do you know where I sleep? Trade secret. Ladies tend to cling to the edge, whereas gentlemen prefer to lie in the middle. What other secrets do you know? I know that, uh, your sag is pretty significant on this side. But, uh... as I said, if you just stick to the middle, you'll find things are... a lot firmer. We're just moving a little fast. There's something that I... No. Mm-mm. No, there's something that I need to tell you. Can't it wait? No, it really can't wait. I don't care if you're married. Oh, God, no, I'm not married. Then shut up and fuck me, Mr. Ten Inches. Oh... Whoa! Okay... Listen... Hey, buddy, you live here? You know Melanie? I think she's in 103? Nope, no Melanie here. Yeah, hi, hello. Um, my name is Adam Bachman. We've actually spoken before. But, um... I'm just, I'm ready now, so, uh... Yeah, I would like to schedule an initial consultation, please. Yes? Oh, thank God you answered! Adam? It... It's Miriam. How did you get this number? Adam, I need you to come over. I wouldn't ask you if this wasn't important, okay? This is a matter of life or death. Whose life? Adam... "always," right? You said, "I'll always be there for you." You're unbelievable. That was, uh, before you... What does commitment mean to you, Adam? Commitment? What part of non-monogamy involves commitment? Polyamory. Okay, whatever. Can you come over? I have nobody else. Thank God you're here. Thank you, thank you, Adam. Thank you so much. Hey, thanks for dressing up. Oh, God. I am so fucked right now. Oh... I'm running out of time, and... and I don't know what to do. What's the emergency? Come on. Don't make me drink alone. Just get to the fucking point, Miriam. Okay. You're pregnant? No, I wish. I'm... I'm ovulating. Oh, ovulating. Yeah, but I'm trying to... But Adam, you're the only one I trust, right? And you said that I could call you no matter what. No, okay, what about your wife? Yeah, we didn't end up, um, getting married in the end. But look. Okay, this arrived today, and I've been planning for months, and then suddenly it's here, and I'm freaking out, so... Wait, when did you guys break up? We didn't. What, so you're just going to be, like, what, non-monogamous friggin' parents? Polyamorous, Adam. Okay, it says "Use this within 24 hours," but I think it should be faster, like, in the first couple of hours. And this whole kit cost 800 bucks, and if I don't use it today, then this stuff is pretty much garbage, and so I have to use it today, so I'm kind of fucked right now, you know, I'm fucked! Did you get this online? It's from the Donor Home Delivery system. Like "Donor", like souvlaki? No, no. No, like sperm, come on. Okay, wait, so you're still with Julia? Correct. Well, then, why isn't she here helping you? Because she left for a cruise this morning, Adam. Without you? She went with her mom. Two weeks. But she knows what you're up to, right? Yeah... ish. "Ish"? Well, I'm working up to it. Working up to what? To telling her. She doesn't exactly like kids. I mean, she finds them chaotic and messy and monosyllabic. But they're not, right? They're so adorable, their little cute little bums and those little toes and these adorable... Miriam! You... can't have a baby. Adam... this is intense for me, okay? I mean, that biological clock, that's real, and I thought it was some sort of patriarchal plot, but it's not. I just... I need a new life, Adam. You can't fix your fucked-up life by having a baby. Okay, just stay there. Just make some lunch or something, and I'm going to go into the bedroom and just do this, okay? I just need moral support. No, you need morals. Hey! Wow, that has some torque to it, hey? Thought it was too small. Yeah, well, size doesn't matter. Oop! No, no, no. No, no, no. No! Ah, it's too much! Oh, oops! Oh, you're so lucky there's nothing left in this. This looks cute. You look cute. Very handsome. You seeing anybody these days? I'm not having that conversation with you. Nobody since me? Wow. That's two years, Adam. That's a long time. Jesus, Miriam. You know, you picked a hell of way to reconnect. You know, you shouldn't leave candles unattended. Can you help me? Can you get the stuff in there? Please? Thank you. So I guess I'll... go make that sandwich. Um... Customer Service had some advice on how to increase my chances. All right. Are you warmed up yet? No wait, wait. I'm having too much fun. Hold on. Who's first? Two years. You were not built for celibacy, cowboy. I'm, uh, not about quantity. All right. I guess it's like riding a bike. Nice. A high-strung bike. All right, you've made your point. Hey, maybe I should do a headstand. Give me the phone, I'm going to call Customer Service. You know, they said that, um, there was a test done on rats, and that rats that are sexually aroused have more chances of getting pregnant than a rat that isn't. Somebody jerks off rats for a living? Stop. Okay. Hey! Hey, Leeland. It's Miriam. Hi! Yeah, okay, well, it's in there. Mm-hm, and I'm just wondering about headstands. Okay, old wives' tale. Got it. Okay, thank you. Hey, what's that? That's my engineering ring. I just took it out. I think I'm ready. Yeah, me too. Uh, hey, Geoff, It's Adam. Listen, I just got a flat tire, so I'm... I'm... I can't make it in today. Okay, my friend. I hope you're not thinking of jumping ship. Ship? Adam, there's a bright future for you here at Mattress King. You're part of the Mattress King family. I hope you realize that. Okay, uh, I do. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? There is no bright future for anyone at minimum wage, Geoff. Bye. All right. Good luck! Adam? Tell me about this five-year gap. You've had no experience in the industry since graduating? Shortly after I hit the job market, there was a family emergency. Interesting. It was pretty all-consuming, and I didn't want to start building my career until I could focus on it completely. Especially since I started school a bit late. And you're sure we've never met before, eh? Yup. Uh, tell me about references. I have great references. Um, they're not from the most dynamic employers, uh, but I graduated top of my class, and I won the Governor's Medal. Huh. Well... you'll have to settle for an intern salary during the probationary period. That's fine. All right. Welcome aboard. Glasses? What? Amazing! Oh... And another big day tomorrow. You're telling me. Julia's coming home tomorrow. What? I guess I'm sleeping at my place tonight. Ya think? But I'm gonna tell her. Like, I'm ready. Yeah, and my couch will be ready for you to sleep on when she boots you out. Your couch, come on... Hey, Adam! Adam, come join us! We need one more to make it even! Go on. Hey, Elsbeth, I've got your order. Your box of Chardonnay and your bottle of whiskey. Oh... Oh, thanks. I'll just tuck it here. And I will see you tomorrow. For your appointment. You will? What appointment? I'm going to take you to see your doctors. You are? Yeah. And don't worry, I'm gonna be there early just like last time. Oh, don't go to any bother. No, it's no bother at all, Elsbeth, okay? We'll see you tomorrow. And Meals on Wheels is coming later on. They're going to bring you chicken tonight, so that'll go nicely with the Chardonnay. I'll see you tomorrow. Good morning. I'm Dr. Sharp, the consulting physician. Sit, please. Okay... Now, I see you're here for an S.R.S. referral. Well... phalloplasty. That's a big step, Adam, hmm? I've been saving up for years. Um, you know, Adam, there's no need for you to pay for this procedure. MSP will cover it. Yeah, for five people a year. True. Are you in a rush? It's at least 20,000 for the surgery, and then don't forget, you'll be responsible for any travel costs incurred. Yeah, I'm not waiting 10 years. How long have you been on testosterone? Four years. Do you know, very few guys in your situation go through with bottom surgery. You look like a man... now. Isn't that enough? I need to feel complete. All right, then. Um, I recommend the plastic surgeon in Montreal, Dr. Marchand. Yeah, he's my first choice. Let's get this ball rolling. Did you get the preliminary tests done? The blood work? Oh, yeah, here. Okay, so you take a look at this. It'll give you a sense of your options in terms of cost and functionality just while I check over your chart, okay? Your blood tests must have gotten mixed up with somebody else's. This says you're pregnant. I'll just sort it out at reception. Hold on a minute, all right? Thanks. Miriam. Who's first? So sorry to keep you waiting, Adam. The mistake isn't from our end, so it must be the lab's, and I'm sorry to say I'll have to do the tests again. But I'll put a rush on... Are you all right? I'm so sorry about the delay. No, you just might not... You're shaking. Sit down. Come on. What's going on? You might not need to do the tests again. I have a... a confession. Oh... You mean the pregnan... Really? Well, that's got to be a first. Look, I can explain. No, no, no. No, there's no need. Your private life is your business. No, it was an accident. Yeah, it usually is. No, I... Okay, I have been kind of AWOL on the testosterone. But my shitty job doesn't have benefits, and so I thought that, you know, maybe if I went a couple of months on and a couple months off... I could save money, and, um... I just... I was helping a friend. This was... It was not meant for me. You know, the old toilet-seat-pregnancy-myth isn't so far-fetched. Those little guys are potent. I just... I just turned 40. How is this possible? Well, um, I guess you're just hyper-fertile. And making medical history. I'm sorry, that's not funny. Well, you've got some decisions to make now, Adam. Hey! Surprise. I got you a single-single. I missed you. What, are you stalking me now? Yeah. I thought maybe we could go have some breakfast together or something. How are you feeling, anyway? I'm fine. Did you take the test? No. I was waiting for you. I thought that maybe we could stop at the pharmacy before, or on the way home... This is insane, Miriam. How are you going to raise a child by yourself? Well, I'm not going to raise it by myself, silly. And besides, I have a very successful and lucrative business. Flexible hours and child-friendly, so no problemo! Exactly! You know, sometimes I really question your judgment. What is it going to be, every day take-your-child- to-work-day at Liquor is Quicker? Hey... What happened in there? Did the doctor say something? Yeah, I can't do this. Adam, you're bound to get cold feet, I get it. But you know what, this child is going to be fine in our hands. "Our hands?" There's no us, Miriam. There can't be an us. Of course there's an us. Come on. Yeah, what gave you that impression? Well, you just spent two weeks in my bed, Adam... Okay, you know what, if you wanted there to be an us, then you actually had to talk to me about it, you know, maybe consult me on this before you... Okay, stop it. Stop it! You are creating a hostile womb environment right now. You need to help me. You know what, don't tell me what I need to do! Holy fuck, Melanie, this is... Sorry, sorry! Oh, sorry. That just slipped out. Oh, really? Come on, I've done pretty well. I haven't called you Melanie once since you transitioned, okay? So ease up. Honestly, Adam, that's who you were in my heart for so long. And... I kind of miss the old times! I don't miss the old times! I hated the old times! Well, I'm old times! So that means you hate me. I am finally happy. Really? Oh, screw you, Miriam! I want out of your life, and I want out of your bed! Adam, wait! Adam, I said I was sorry. Look, this has nothing to do with your transition. I'm thrilled that you're finally happy in your own skin, but if you ask me... I didn't ask you. Okay, but if you ask me, you were happier before! You have no idea, do you? You have no idea what I went through. So, tell me! I have! Tell me again! 35 years, Miriam. I spent 35 years feeling trapped. It's not exactly easy to go through gender reassignment, while you're going bankrupt, and then have your girlfriend dump you because she doesn't like men! Don't like men? What would give you that idea? That makes no sense. You dumped me because you're a lesbian, and you don't do guys! As soon as I said I was transitioning, it was game over. No, no, that's you. You dumped me. I didn't leave you! What? Yeah, you left me. You don't even remember. Are you fucking crazy, Miriam? I know what you did. You left me because you didn't want to be polyamorous anymore. No. Yes! Yes, that was the story. Yes, I remember! I was there! Yes! God... No. And stop following me! Hey! The good daughter returns. How was it? Oh... I've got a few more decades of Karma banked. Did you miss me? Terribly. Aw. Tell me everything. How was it? Did you see any icebergs, did you see any whales, or...? Mm, yes, no, and, um, Mom says hi. Aw, hi to Mom. Hey, I was thinking we could get Thai food tonight because I didn't have time to cook. I've been working really hard. Uh, sure. Uh, can we do the one near my office? I've got to get some stuff done tonight. Okay. I got this. All right. Yeah? Good morning. Sorry to bother you, sir. Fire Marshal, checking exits and alarms. Uh, it's just through the back bedroom window. Uh, actually it's back here? I'm sure it is, but where's Melanie? What? I'm looking for Melanie Turcotte. Been looking a long time. Okay, you know what? Who the fuck are you? I'm a bailiff. Bailiff? You're a douche who's just been hanging around my building. Hey! Miss Melanie Turcotte owes a lot of money. It's my job to find her. She doesn't live here. So get the fuck out of my house. House? Are you kidding me? Hey, seriously. What are you doing with your life? Here, just take this, all right? Look, I'm just trying to do my job. Where's she hiding? Melanie hasn't lived here for a very long time, so why don't you just get the fuck out! Did you just slap me? Ow! Fuck! Asshole! Take my card in case you see her. Ouù habitez-vous? "Ouù habitez-vous?" Moi, j'habite àMontréal. "Moi, j'habite à..." Victoria. Je vous pré sente mon mari. "Je vous présente..." ma fils. Come in. Entrez! Qu'est qu'on mange- Bonjour, ma sweet. Hey. What's for dinner? Qu'est-ce que c'est pour le diner? Fish tacos with papaya salad. Nummy. I don't know how you're still single with all that lovely cooking. It's nothing elaborate. I'm on a budget. Are you going out later this evening? No. It's our night. I never go out on our night. Oh, yeah, except for the last two Fridays. But that's okay, that's okay. Were you on a date? What have you done? Is it broken? Oh, no, it's a tiny little scratch. I had a tiny accident at work. With a mattress? I was being clumsy. Let me see. - Please. You're over-reacting... - You might need stitches. - Let me pull the band-aid off! - No, don't touch it! And now you're getting into fights. Your father always wanted a son. Ton pere toujours désiré... un fils. You want some wine? Uh, no, I'm feeling a little... off. I worry about you, sweetie. Ma chérie. What's with all the French? Alzheimer's. You have Alzheimer's? No, and I'm not going to. Learning a new language is the best way to exercise your neuroplasticity. Uh, Mom... there's something I want to talk to you about. Oh yeah? So, I, um... I saw Miriam. Oh, please tell me you're not getting back together with her. No. No, of course not. No. God, no. I was just helping her. Helping her with what? You don't even want to know what she's up to. I'm sure I wouldn't. You know, I lived through all that '70s sexual revolution business. Ton pere? Don't get me started. It was bullshit then, and it's bullshit today. Okay, um... You won't believe this, but, uh... Miriam wants to have a baby. Are you... Some women should have to get a license before they get pregnant. Yeah, did you get a license? That has got nothing to do with it. I knew what I was doing. Regardez. Voilà! Le proof est dans le pudding. Right. Perfect. Hey, hey, qu'est-ce que c'est se passe, huh? Um... This has been a long time. I got a new job... at an engineering firm. As an engineer? Intern. That calls for a drink. I can't keep ducking Canada Student Loan forever. But it's a good job. Good salary, and some benefits. And I made the call. I booked an appointment with the bankruptcy trustee for Monday at 9:00. The new me. And if you run into friends from school? I don't think that's going to happen. I switched my focus. To what? Seismic retrofitting? Ooh... That's definitely going to happen. The big one. Morning, babe. Good morning. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Check these colours out. "Banana-fibre-yellow." That keeps you regular. Look how warm that is. Isn't that beautiful? And very gender-neutral, which I like. We're not talking about this again. But you know what? Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. I like my life the way it is. Okay, but I'm 40, Julia, so... Right? Babies are not my thing. They're loud and expensive. All the more reason for you to have a kid. I mean, you can afford it, right, you can afford the summer camps, and the private schools, all the fun stuff. Miriam, I should not be anyone's mom, and... What's that? And what? Nothing. Are you going to drink this? No. Okay... Okay. Hey. This is Adam. Leave me a message. Hey, Adam. It's me! Adam, I've been calling you all day. Where are you? I don't want to take this test by myself. I want you to be here. You know? Together. You should be here. Adam? Just pick up the phone! I mean, where are you? Pick up. Pick up! Look, I don't want to take... Hey, Adam. Hey. Good morning. Welcome. Brian, this is the new guy, Adam. Hey. Hey. This is Brian. You're going to be interning under him, basically shadowing him for the first couple of days, and then we'll throw some real work at you, okay. All right, make him feel like one of the guys. Get him a hat. Right. Wow, old-school. Uh, yeah, I restored it myself. The engine and everything? Every nut, every bolt. Duncan, come meet the new guy. Hey, what up? Hey. How's it going? You look familiar. I get that a lot. Okay, whatever. Where's your hat, you a-hole? Ah, for fuck... Yeah, my wife won't let me go near one of those bikes. Women, right? What if you just tell the truth? Meaning what? Tell them, the guys at work. You gonna keep it a secret forever? Mom, are you crazy? Have you met any engineers lately? They're not exactly the most progressive bunch. Besides, I like being one of the guys. Give people more credit. 20 years ago, they'd have drawn and quartered me by frosh week. No, you've got to live in the now. You're living in the past, sweetheart. I'm trying to keep a low profile, okay? I just want to keep my job. Any news from Miriam? Nothing. Is she... I don't know. All this, it's really about Miriam, isn't it? This? What, this? This... this becoming the breadwinner. Le gagner de pain. This is about me becoming the person that I've always been, that I finally am. Oh... I just... I just want to protect you. Did you like being a mother? What kind of question is that? In case you haven't noticed, I am still a mother. I mean, when I was little, did you... I don't know, did you enjoy it? That's a crazy question. There is... nothing better. Nothing. And you were a holy terror. I think that you would be a great parent. A great father. I gotta pee. Again? I don't know, maybe I should just go over there and see him. You know, instead of calling him all the time. Face-to-face always makes an impression. Yeah. You're right. For the baby. That is adorable. Thank you. Well, I guess I don't have to get you to cough. Can you scootch your bottom down a bit, please, for me? Right down, right down, please, to the end. Okay, okay. That's it. I just want a referral. Do we really have to do this? Well, before I refer you, I just have to know how far along you are. I know exactly how far along I am. Well, sometimes you think you know. Comfy? No. So, were you ever planning on getting the hysterectomy? Yeah, it was on my to-do list. Good. You know, it's just surgery. A little inconvenient. And this isn't? Whoa! Okay, that's good. That's enough. Well, appears everything is working down there. Just give me the damn referral. Give me your phone, give me your phone! No, no, sweetie, not right now, okay? Hold onto the stroller... Babe! Yup? You home? Yeah, I'm coming! Good news! Babe! What are you doing? I'll be right there! What's up? Let's celebrate! Ooh, careful, careful, careful. What are we celebrating? As soon as discovery was done, they offered to settle. Big settlement. Wow, good for you. I nailed it. Okay, well, don't nail me. And why not? Well, because... Because. You look great. Oh... Did you stop eating wheat again? Yup, yes, I have stopped eating wheat. You look all youthful and glowy. And I'm not actually drinking right now. Well, there's no wheat in champagne. No, I'm on a cleanse. Aw, come on. Boring. Yeah, super boring, huh? Adam! What... Mom... What? What is it? What's happened? Sit down. I have news. I know. I know. Je sais. No, you can't possibly know this. If you and Miriam are destined to be together, then, bon, c'est la vie. It's none of my business. I will stand by you, no matter what. Oh, God. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to say. Oh, Adam. I know Miriam's a handful, but she's not the Antichrist. Mom, I'm pregnant. Are we playing a game? You're the teenage daughter, and I'm the mother? You know, that was the one thing I never had to worry about when you were in high school. Mom, no, really! I really am pregnant. It happened when Miriam was inseminating. I don't know. She got sperm from a donor, and then... I was supposed to be helping her, and I don't know, I guess I just helped too much. You know, we were fooling around, and we were sharing... things. And I didn't think about it because I have been on hormones, and I haven't had a period for three years, okay? So it's not exactly a possibility... Wait. Back up. Back up. What do you mean, sharing... things? I know, it's not safe, but... we were sharing toys. Toys? Like Lego? Yeah, Mom, we built a Lego castle... No, sex toys. Like... Oh! Oh, okay, okay. No, now I get it. No, I'm down with this. You think I don't have a girl's best friend? I have several. What? Mom! Okay, yeah, I get it. So you and Miriam were using the same... Sperm. Yeah, Mom. You're pregnant. You're having a baby? And-and Miriam, is she? I don't know. Possibly. She hasn't taken the test yet. I had given up hope on ever becoming a grandmother. What? No, no. Whoa, Mom! Mom... I can't go through with this. Oh, no, Adam. No drinking, it's bad for the baby. There's no baby! I'm trying to be a man, and I was doing a pretty good job of it until... this. You're going to love being a parent. Yeah, "parent" is the operative word, because... I can't be a... mother. Grand-maman. Ooh, I love the way that sounds. Oh, that's much better than "Granny" or "Gram" or "Grammy." Grand-Maman, it's so dignified. And what is the kid supposed to call me? She can call you Dad. What do I do when Dad starts to... I mean, that's one hell of a beer gut. Go to a convent like when I was a girl. Mom, I have a beard! So do the nuns. Oh, God, how will I go to work? Work from home. Use Skype. And, and... I will babysit everyday. I promise. It's just not in the cards. Men don't have babies. But... but... it's a miracle. I just want it over as soon as possible. And Miriam cannot know. But... what about Grand-maman? Mom, I am sorry, but... I'll get you a grandchild, I promise. Just... not like this. Hey, Adam. A bunch of us are heading over to the Fog Horn for some beers. You coming? Uh, okay. I got a couple of things to finish up here, but it shouldn't take me long. Yeah, okay, just don't crap out on us like you did last week, okay? Okay. All work and no play... Yeah. That is you out of my life. Hey, Adam. Good work on that proposal this week. I'm impressed. - Thanks. - All right. The boys have gone for a pint. You should come. - All right. - Okay. Fuck! It's still 2-0. Still? Nice fruit beer, Bri. It's a craft beer, idiot. It's pink, dude. What's in that, cherries? It's apricot. Yeah, exactly. See this? Stout. Real man's beer. - Cheers. - Cheers! Cheers. So, what do you got on tonight, Adam? Um... Doesn't look like you're married. You got a girlfriend? Uh, well... Maybe? The wicked world of women. Yeah. Is it just ending or is it just starting? Actually it ended a couple of years ago, but then it recently started again. Couldn't take no for an answer. Yeah, it's kind of complicated. You still into her? Yeah. I mean, it's just... it's just complicated. Nah, women, they don't have to be complicated, okay? It's simple. They're either with you or they're against you. What's so complicated? Uh, well... She's pregnant. Hey! - Whoa! - Oh. That's great. Nice work. Boys can swim! Well done. Listen, I'm gonna get us another round. No fruit beer for this guy. I sense the, uh, complications run deeper. God, you can't even imagine. You, uh, you doing the right thing? Is she keeping it? Oh, yeah, yeah, she wants it. She's... It's... So you planned it, then. Well... she planned it? A-ha, yeah, that is tricky. Yeah. Adam, you're up. Don't even try to win. Here we go. Miriam? Hey. You're 100% stalking me! I'm not wearing any underwear. What? I'm not wearing any underwear! Great, take out a billboard. Hold this. What? Okay, give me your hand. Oh, God, what are you doing? I need your help with this. Okay. Give it. I need two minutes. For what? Oh, God! Two minutes to tell you I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I put you through hell. I'm sorry that I've been a real drama queen. You don't deserve any of this. All right, that'll do it. What? Okay. And I'm sorry... I'm sorry that I asked you to help me get pregnant, and I never told you the truth. So, what, the whole turkey baster party was your way of trying to get back together with me? Basically. How very romantic, Mir. Adam, I don't care if you're a man or a woman, or somewhere in between. I just care about you. All I can see is what's inside you. And what about polyamory? No, I want to commit to you. Just you and our family. How much longer does this take? 50 seconds! I want it all. All the chaos and the messiness. I want the banal and the beautiful. I want the family vacations and the training wheels... It's push-bikes. What? Nobody uses training wheels anymore. It's all about push-bikes. Okay, then that's what I want. I want the push-bikes, Adam. Still nothing. 10 seconds left! Hey... you and I both know that we should be together. Oh, it's two lines. What is two lines? What's two lines? It means that we're having a baby. Congratulations, Miriam! Wow. Bonjour! Mom. Oh, sweetie, how are you feeling? Yeah, I-I can't... I-I'm a friggin' hormonal roller coaster. Okay, okay, I think it's time to make the appointment. Sweetie? How does anybody do this? I feel psychotic. Yeah, I remember. Sort of, vaguely. But women do it all the time, you know, every minute of every day. What? Not like this, they don't. Yeah, well, not quite like this, no. Oh, my gosh, these are cute. Oh, yes, they are. Right? Oh, and we need one of these, for sure. Locally made. Oh, nice! Okay, so I want to make sure this registry has only organic and natural toys. Nothing plastic, right? Not a problem. We carry the finest wooden toys here with non-toxic paint. Fair trade. Great. Okay, here we go. Mm-hm... Mm-hm. Is there another name I can put on the registry? No. There's no father. Mm-hm. Okay, and when would you like this to go live on the website? We recommend six weeks before any shower. You've got lots of time. Right, I'm hoping to get it up as soon as possible, just 'cause I want to have my baby shower, like, next month, so... Your own shower? Yeah. You really should wait till your last trimester before having any shower. Well, my friends aren't that organized, so... Just go. All right. Okay, that was the easy part. But tomorrow, I have a 1:00, 1:30, and a 4:45. Okay, yeah. Perfect. See you then. Hi there. Good morning. Yes, we're here an 8:00 a.m. appointment for Melanie. Right. Okay. Take a seat. Thank you. Thanks, Mom. For what? Being here. Melanie? Room 2. Melanie? Is it that way? Hello. I'm Dr. Beck. Hi. I'm not sure how I can help you, um... Melanie? Oh, uh... Um... it's me. It's... I go by Adam. Adam. Okay. Adam. Any luck? Couldn't find anything. Let me try. You can jump down. We can get you in relatively quickly, end of the week if you want, but, sadly, this won't be covered by the Medical Services Plan. - What? - Why? There's no code in the software that matches your gender to this procedure, no loophole that I can find, and all your current legal documentation says you're a man. I called the Health Authority, and they weren't at all helpful. Seems pretty cut and dry. Men don't get pregnant, according to them. Oh, for goodness' sake. Well, fine. Fair enough. How much? Well, again, it's technically an elective procedure, like cosmetic surgery, so the price is somewhat higher. It's up to $2,700. What? Jesus, that's more than we paid for the sperm! Sorry, you paid for... It was artificial insemination. Not for me, for my girlfriend. Not me. I'm not his girlfriend. I'm his mother. Okay, thank you! They're all long stories in this office. Do you take credit cards? Absolutely. I don't have a credit card. I have a credit card. Well, we're not using it. What about a payment plan? I'm sure you'll... pull something together. Hmm? But Adam, you need to act quickly. At this facility, we only do the procedure in the first seven weeks. Well, so, um, how long do I have? One week. Two at the extreme outside. Beyond that, the red tape would be prohibitive. Especially in, uh, your condition. Let me take an advance out on my credit card. You pay me back when you can. It'll be really fast 'cause you have a job now. Yeah, but the trustee takes out a huge chunk each month. Okay, well, then, you have two options. Either take my help, or go live God-knows-where for the next six months. Look, you know I have some cash saved up. Oh, no, no, that's not right. That's for your operation. Ce n'est pas... right. Well... Look, I've been thinking. You have to tell Miriam. Uh, no... She's kind of like the father. Mom! No, no, no, no, no, it was her plan. Yeah, so says the feminist. That's got nothing to do with it. If Miriam is pregnant, these children are siblings. They're almost like twins. They're not even children. They're just potential. You're not being fair. Don't talk to me about fair. Hi, Fran. Miriam. Adam's not here, I'm afraid. Yeah, I was actually hoping to talk to you. - Me? - Yeah. Okay. Come in? Tea. I just... I want to make things right, Fran. Okay. Okay. So, I know that I've behaved badly, and I just want you to know that things are going to be different from now on. Is this a rehearsal? 'Cause, you know, it's really not me that you should be telling. Just... One, uh... Would you like a glass of wine? No. - Okay, so this is happening? - Yeah. - The baby? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. So, keep rehearsing. You're doing very well, by the way. Okay, um... I behaved badly, and I want you to know that things are going to be different from now on. I want your blessing. My... My... Aren't you the man. Did you bring a ring, too? I have something for you. Wait right there. - Okay. - Okay. Just one second! Mm-hm. Ah, here we are. Here we go. Wow! Oh, um... Wow, that's... Wow. Well, you never know. You might have a girl. Right. Oh! What? Nothing, it's just like a weird, like a... What? Oh, all right, all right... Oh, God! - I'm calling an ambulance. - No, no, no, no! Call Adam! All right, I'm calling Adam. Breathe. Oh, God, Fran! Okay, just breathe, okay? It's like I'm being punished, Adam. Maybe I should start praying. I always try everything once. You don't even believe in God, Miriam. I believed in us, and look where that got me. Go! Go! Adam... Adam, sit down. Just-just... No, just... Uh, you can see her now. Sorry. Hey. Hi. Oh, my God. Miriam, are you okay? Oh, my God, babe, what happened? I'm so sorry, Julia. I'm sorry. It's okay, I just want to know you're gonna be all right. I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay. So, what happened to you? What? She had a miscarriage. Okay... What the fuck is going on? Julia, you don't recognize me? No, I don't. And you're the father? Wow, you really don't recognize me, do you? Holy shit. Yeah. Wow. Melanie? It's Adam now. You, um... Uh... That was fast. So... how did you get pregnant? Why don't I give you guys some, uh, privacy. Yeah. Thanks, Mom. For what? For being here. If you're willing to go to this extreme, then obviously it's something you really want. Yeah, but what do I do now? You'll find a way. Jeez... What are you going to do now? I don't know. You stay at the house as long as you need. Hey. I made your favourite breakfast. No. Come on, Miriam, it's a nice day. No. What do you say, after you eat, we'll go out for a walk or something? No. No, Adam, it's too soon. You know the sooner you start moving around, the sooner you'll start to feel better. I don't want to feel better. I failed this child, Adam. You know, this is my fault. It was my responsibility, and I created a hostile womb environment. No kid could survive in that. Well, we'll just try again. No. We'll wait till you're ready and then try again. No, I can't go through that again. I don't want to lose another baby. You were right. I wasn't supposed to be a mother. This is just the proof. Hey... I think you should have a child. You do, huh? Mm-hm. Do you think I should have a child with you? Yeah. Yeah? You know, whenever you're ready. Right. So, when do you think you'll be ready? I don't know, I mean, maybe we can adopt or something, but... right now, I just need more time. Uh... think eight months might be enough time? I don't know. I mean, eight months, nine months, ten months. No, it's eight months. God... Why is that funny to you? It's... I like seeing you happy, though. Yeah? Yeah, this looks good on you. To Friday Rye-Day! There you go. There it is. There it is, right there. Soda water? Adam, what the hell, man? Your beer's getting warm. Yeah, I'm just not really drinking right now. Oh, God. Don't tell me your girlfriend's got you on one of these fucking no carb bullshit things. No, no. Carbs are fine. I just, um, I'm just not, uh, drinking. Oh, if you're on the wagon, you know, we're behind you. Ah, yeah. Thanks. Um, no, uh... Listen, there's something I need to tell you guys. Sorry, um... Okay, so I used to be Melanie. Uh... Right, I was born Melanie, and then, uh, four years ago, I switched. And now, now I'm Adam. So there you go. I'm, uh, transgendered. So... that's like... bisexual or... whatever? Shut up, you moron. What? Google it. Just stop acting like such a fool. I don't know! No, no, no, it's good. Um, I... no, I like women. I've always, always liked women. Okay. Cool. Uh, and I should say... Oh, God, one more thing... Aw, don't tell me you're a vegan. Yup, that's it... No, not a vegan. Actually, we went to school together. What, like grade school? Mm, nope. University. Naw. No, no, no, man. I would've remembered that. Do you remember... Melanie? Well, yeah, I remember Melan... Fuck! Did I hit on you? Fuck. Yeah, yeah, shut up. Fuck you guys. I remembered you. What? How? Well, U-VAN is my alma mater. I'm on the board of governors there. I was the guy to hand out the medal that year. Convocation. So you always... you always knew? Well, there's only so many girls in the engineering department. And even fewer win the Governor's Medal. I guess so. Cheers. Cheers. Whoa, breakaway, breakaway! Yeah, go! Go! Skate! Yeah! Nice. Told you guys. We had this. Who else knows? Just my mom. And everyone at work. Are you insane? I thought you wanted to keep this job. Come on, Mir, you've got to give people more credit. Me? What has gotten into you? Okay. Adam, come on, you can't do this. Do what? This. Come on, I mean, it's taken you this long to become a man. You can't be pregnant. I just hope you still want to be with me even without a baby. Hey. We're having a baby. There's no discussion. I cannot ask you to do that. It's not fair. You're not asking me. I am telling you. Really? Really. Wow.
