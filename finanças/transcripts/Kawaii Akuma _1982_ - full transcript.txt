Tuesday Night Suspense Theater Tuesday Night Suspense Theater Summer 197x Japan Alice. Let go. Alice. That's a good girl. She's so pretty. Cute Devil Screenplay by Machiko Nasu Directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi The bride is beautiful, you're a lucky man. Thank you. - Congratulations, Koji. - Thanks. Please take care of my brother. Shall we go? It's so pretty. You're too kind. Can I have it after the wedding? When you grow up, you can have one even nicer. I like this one. Honey. Alice, why don't you go play? No, I like it here. Alice, don't bother the bride. Go play. - But Mom... - Go. - OK. Everything's ready, ma'am. I'll have to fix my makeup. - Do you want me to help? - Nope. She's still a kid. Hey. Hey, Alice, what's up? Give me the veil, I'll take good care of it. I'm sorry, I can't. - Why? - I'm going to keep it until I die. Until you die? Yes, that's how important the veil is. You understand? So I can have it when you die? Sure, you can have it. Now, go play. Let go. Die! Alice! Alice! Alice! Is the bride ready? She's probably fixing her makeup. Where could she have gone? Fuyuko! Alice! Aunt Fuyuko died... so I can have her veil, right? Same Day, Same Time Vienna, Austria Wait, Johann! - Goodbye! - Johann! Wait! Johann! Johann! Don't go!!! Die! Johann! One Week Later Ryoko? Three Years Later Japan Keep still! You didn't kill him! It was an accident! Johann didn't die just because you said "Die!" Hey, it was an accident, just an accident. It was an accident. She's regained her senses. She'll be all right. Koji. Ryoko. Koji. Koji. Ryoko, shall we? I'm just going to have a word with Dr. Tsukahara first. Doctor, is my sister really all right? She believes that she has caused the death of her lover. The guilt overwhelmed her. We know the cause: she was racked with guilt. I don't think she'll attempt suicide again. Still, she lost her sister and her lover in one go. It will take a little more time and care... to overcome such a shock. Take good care of Ryoko, Koji. We owe you a great deal, Doctor. Thank you. Koji, I hope this is all right. I'm not actually family, and I'm worried that I'll be a burden. Don't worry about it. Think of yourself as a live-in tutor. They've been on their own since my brother died. Alice will be happy. And I do think of you as a little sister. So don't give it another thought. Thank you. - Has Alice gotten bigger? - Yep. I only know her from the photo my sister sent me. Nice house. Come on. Keiko? Alice? They're probably in the garden. Keiko, Ryoko's here. Alice. We're glad you made it, Ryoko. We were waiting for you. Alice. Keiko, we're happy you're going to live with us. You're an accomplished pianist and lived in Vienna. - Don't make too much of it. - Aren't we lucky, Alice? Alice, give Ryoko a piece of cake. Thank you. What's wrong? Did you come for the veil? What veil? Aunt Fuyuko's veil. Aunt Fuyuko... do you have it? I'm taking very good care of it. Then you can keep it. You can remember her by it. Isn't that nice, Alice? Alice, show Ryoko to her room. - Here's the piano. - Oh, yes. That's my dad. He looks kind. This is how I remember my dad. It's pretty. It's this room. Over here. This room over here. It's beautiful. Look, you can see the ocean. Do you like it? Very much so. Make yourself at home. Because you are at home. You've been so kind to me, I'm at a loss for words. I feel I have a debt to you. Uncle Koji, let's play. Let's go to the ocean. You're going to pull my arm out of its socket! Why whatever is the matter? The veil! It's my sister's veil! Oh, that's just one of Alice's tricks. What am I going to do with that child? Good night. Alice, be careful. It's all right, it's my secret path. Alice, look, we took the wrong road somewhere. You're right. It's really confusing around here. - I won't be able to get Mary. - What's Mary? It's a musical doll that Mrs. Segawa has. Mary is beautiful. She's going to give it to the student who sings the best. And that's definitely going to be me. Don't worry, I'll help you. Let's sing. Did you play a trick on me last night with the veil? What are you talking about? - Nothing. Have a nice day. - You too. - Ryoko, some flower tea? - Yes, please. Did you sleep well last night? The veil bothered me. What are you talking about? You said Alice was playing a prank on me. I said that? Yes. That's funny, I slept like a log last night. Are you sure you weren't dreaming? Dreaming? But I saw the veil. Hello, Tokyo Telewave. Yes. Just a moment. Chief, call for you. Thank you. Hello? Keiko. Ryoko? She's not here. She stormed out this morning and I haven't seen her since. I'm a little worried. A veil? Ryoko said the veil flew into her room? She said I told her it was just one of Alice's jokes. But I don't remember saying any such thing. I hope she's really over her illness. Over there. That window. How did she fall? Window. Mirror. White dress. Sad... accident. Show me the room. Fuyuko! - Ryoko! Ryoko! - Ryoko! Ryoko! - Ryoko! Ryoko! Ryoko. Koji. What are you doing all the way out here? Why are you here? Keiko said you were acting funny. I had a hunch that you might have come here. What's wrong? It's your sister. What about my sister? Tell me. Forget it. Ryoko. You don't have to worry about me. I just wanted to visit my sister's grave. That's all. Ryoko, I want you to take it easy and not worry about money. Thank you, Koji. Fuyuko! Who are you?! Wait! Fuyuko! What are you doing out at this hour, Ryoko? It's not safe. I saw Fuyuko in her wedding gown. Her wedding gown? I chased after you, but I saw no such thing. You didn't? What are you doing out here? I followed you all the way from the house. I think you had another bad dream. Let's go home. Tuesday Night Suspense Theater Is Ryoko at it again? Koji, you should talk to Dr. Tsukahara. I'm worried. It's not normal to go out wandering like that in the middle of the night. She said... she saw Fuyuko. Fuyuko? We have to do something, before it's too late. This house might be bad for her. It reminds her of Fuyuko. She should probably convalesce somewhere else. For now, I'll just talk to Dr. Tsukahara. - I'll see him as soon as I can. - Please do. Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice! Wait! What's the matter, Alice? Mrs. Segawa said that I can't have Mary. You mean the doll that goes to the best singer? Didn't it go well? Oh, I was the best, so I told Mrs. Segawa to give me Mary, - but she wouldn't. - Why not? She said that there was someone who sang better. There's going to be a drawing festival tomorrow. She said she was going to give Mary to her then. Well, that's too bad. Maybe next time there'll be an even better doll. - NO! I want Mary! - Alice... Mary's Mine! Don't worry, I'll look for a doll like Mary. NO! I want Mary. But you can't have her. Calm down. Play the piano! Practice! - Play, damn you! - NOOO! Alice, you spoiled brat! Get over here! Will you never learn! Stop! Alice! Alice! Please stop! - Have you been drinking? - No! Don't take it out on her. Take what out? You don't understand a thing! What are you talking about? If you don't want to wind up like Fuyuko, you'd best leave now. I was opposed to you staying here from the start. But Koji said you couldn't be alone. What do you mean, "Wind up like my sister"? What are you saying? Wasn't her death an accident! Yes, it was an accident. Of course it was. Wait! Alice? What are you doing up? What are you doing? I was talking to the man at the shoe store. He said this helps your shoes last a long time. I'm going to wear them to the drawing festival tomorrow. Really? It's late, you should get some sleep. Yes, ma'am. - Don't those shoes hurt? - No, they're perfect. Maybe someday I'll have my own shoe store. Maybe so. Look, there's Mary. Mrs. Segawa thinks she's so hot. She said she's going to announce who will get Mary at the drawing festival. It's so dumb. Don't talk like that about your teachers. Die! Alice! Die! Come here, everybody! Bye, Ryoko. - Mrs. Segawa. - What is it? Hello, Kawamura residence. Someone fell? Who? Mrs. Segawa evidently fell into the river. Hey, Ryoko, why are you here? Your mom asked me to come get you. They haven't found her, but I'm sure she's dead. Alice. "Keiko and Alice Kawamura." She's Alice. How terrible... You must have been terrified. I wasn't scared; I didn't fall off the bridge. It must have been divine retribution! Divine retribution? Yes, because she didn't give Mary to me. God punished her. I'm so hungry, isn't there anything to eat? This is where she fell. Why was she here? Students weren't allowed to come here. One of her students snuck out here. I found her body! Over here! Is there a doll? - A doll? - Did you find the doll? I know... You're her mother, aren't you? You're young and attractive. Wait, I want to talk. Let's go to my boathouse. It's nice. A little messy though. I like it a lot. I think you'll like it too. Get away from me. You didn't see Mrs. Segawa fall, did you? No. But you showed Mr. Kimigawa where she died. Yes, I also told her that Sasaki had gone to the river. Is that a classmate of yours? I went to look for him with Mrs. Segawa. - Then what happened? - When we got close to the river, Mrs. Segawa said it was dangerous, so I should go back to school. So I went back. Did you hear Mrs. Segawa fall in the river? I heard a big splash. When I turned around she was gone. So I ran back and told everyone. So you didn't actually see what happened, did you? - No. - Good. Thank you. Is there anything else we can do? Alice, just one more thing... - You lied. - I did? Sasaki said that he didn't go to the river. You're the only one who went to the river, aren't you? Why did you lie to Mrs. Segawa? I must have made a mistake. Do I have to go to jail? No, you don't! It isn't a crime to misunderstand something. Is there anything suspicious about how she died? She seems to have been... bludgeoned multiple times with a metal instrument. It doesn't sit quite right. She must have hit her head when she fell. I was hoping your daughter might've been able to shed some light on the matter... It looks like I came out for nothing. Thank you for coming, Detective. The sky is dark. Die! They haven't found her, but I'm sure she's dead. She seems to have been bludgeoned multiple times with a metal instrument. "A metal instrument"... NO! Her shoes! She used her shoes! They're not here! Where are they?! Where are your shoes?! What are you doing, Ryoko? What's the matter? The shoes... What shoes? - I have to look for the shoes. - What... Hey, Uncle Koji! How are you? Have you been good? Dr. Tsukahara said he'd like for the three of us to have lunch. What about Dr. Tsukahara? Why were you talking with Dr. Tsukahara? Please don't misunderstand. Alice, go play. No, I want to stay with you. Alice... Absolutely not, I want to stay with you. - I have a headache. - You do? Alice, you play with your uncle. - I'm going to head home. - Okay. Ryoko... Ryoko! What happened to those shoes? Ryoko, what are you doing? - Why are you in my room? - The veil... I'm sorry... The veil... I just had to see Fuyuko's veil, so I was looking for it. The veil? I knew it. You can't have it, it's mine. Aunt Fuyuko promised me. What did she promise you? She said I could have it when she died. If she died? When did she make this promise? The day she fell. That's why I have it. Alice... what in the world did you do? I got the veil, that's all. If a body meet a body coming through the rye If a body kiss a body need a body cry Every laddie have a lassie, none they say have I The accident three years ago? The girl lost her balance and fell to her death. She wouldn't have fallen so violently just by losing her balance. I thought it was strange, so I looked into it. All of the attendees at the wedding reception were gathered for a group photo, so it's impossible that it was anything but an accident. Uh... Umm... - What about Alice? - Alice? The little girl? What? Alice! No! There's something wrong with me. I know. I want to talk. Come to my boathouse. Boathouse? Just in the nick of time. I was just about to visit you. Tell me what you know. Let's go inside. What did you see? What's the hurry? Here you go. - They're sweet. - I don't want any. If you won't talk, I'm going home. All right, don't get angry. What did you see? I was relaxing on my boat, as usual. And then... At first, I couldn't tell what was happening, but then the teacher drowned and there was all the commotion. I figured it out. That little girl must have really wanted that doll. Why didn't you go to the police? I don't like the police. Plus, I like you. Cut it out! Don't go! Get away from me! Don't be angry, there's nothing to be afraid of. You can have the shoes! They're not here! And Mary's gone too! It's Aunt Ryoko: she stole it. What's the matter? I was almost killed! That quill pen came flying at me! Come, in my room! What quill pen! It was here. It's... gone. It flew out of the dresser and stuck in the wall here. Ryoko, you must be tired. A child? Could a child... kill people for a veil, a doll, or other objects that catch their fancy? Why would you come all the way out here to ask such a question? Is there such a mental illness? A lack of affection, or too much affection... sometimes induces children to kill small animals. But, killing people, "killing a lot of people"... is incredibly rare in children. What if a child was pathologically possessive? Pathologically possessive children do indeed exist, but it's difficult to imagine that it would lead to murder. But it does. Who are you talking about? This isn't hypothetical, is it? It's Alice. She killed my sister... and... she tried to kill me. It's true. I'm not crazy anymore. It's true, I know she did it. I know she killed them. - Alice killed them. - I understand. I understand. I understand. Hello, Koji? Murder?! Alice? Ryoko said so? I'll go home right away. Look here. - Close your eyes and count to five. - Okay. My shoes. I'll hand them over if you give me a kiss. A kiss? Wait! Wait a minute! What did you give to her? What did you give Alice? A shoelace. She really wanted the shoe. I told her that if I gave the shoes to the police, they'd immediately know that she was the killer. I told her that she'd go to the chair. I want Alice's shoes. I'll give them to you if you come out to my boathouse again. - Okay. - Really? - On one condition. - What? I'll be waiting in the park. Leave it to me. Tuesday Night Suspense Theater Are you really going to give me my shoes? Yes, why do you want them so bad? I like them. Liar. There's blood on them. You beat the teacher with them so she'd drown. I know everything. Not only are you a thief, but you're also a bad liar. There's something wrong with you. - Don't you want the shoes? - Yes. Then tell the truth. You also killed a bride, because you wanted the veil. How did you know that? I'm like god. I see all of the bad things that children do. - Where are my shoes? - I'll take you there. Alice really is a killer. What's the matter, Ryoko? You know the truth, don't you? What are you talking about? What Alice did! - Where are my shoes? - Inside. - Are you waiting for someone? - No, not really. Then give them back. I'm not going to give them for free. I was just thinking of something fun. While you're thinking, I'll look for them. Now where would you hide them? You won't guess. Here. - What is it? - Sugar. If you eat one, you'll have happy dreams. Have a seat, don't move. I need to get up higher. What are you doing?! Koji, please go faster. Alice is going to get away. Faster! Faster! Alice, unblock the door! Die! Alice! Alice! Alice! Where are you? I'm not angry, just come out! I know what you did! But it's not your fault! Alice, you're sick! Die! You don't want to see this. It's my fault. I drove her to it. What are you talking about? Alice isn't here. The tape! There's still the tape! We still have that... and the shoes! The tape! - Ryoko! - Before they burn up! - Ryoko! This tape? That's it. I have it on tape. Alice admitted to killing my sister. It's ruined, isn't it? Are you saying that Alice killed your sister, her teacher, and the young man on the boat? It's hard to believe. It was for me at first. But it's true... Alice is sick. The police have ruled all three incidents as accidents. They said the fire was an accident. He was a habitual drug user. He appears to have accidently... knocked over the gasoline can when he was high. If they had investigated, they'd know. They couldn't believe that a child could kill. So they didn't check. That a child could kill someone for their veil or doll? It's not possible. Keiko, what do you think? Alice is only eight. Could an eight-year-old girl kill three adults? Your imagination has gotten the best of you. You're probably just tired. You should rest. You think I'm out of my mind, don't you? I'm not. Alice is the one who's sick. Alice killed people. You must believe me. Please, I'm not sick. Please believe me. - Please! I'm telling you the truth! - I understand, Ryoko. The tape isn't completely destroyed. There might still be some way we can play it. I have a friend with some recording equipment. I'll check to see if she can help. How's that? - Oh, that was fun! - Good work, you were smokin' hot. Right on target. The 4/4 beat is really your sweet spot. - It was a little long. - That's right. - He sings pretty well. He's just a slave to the beat. Sorry for the wait. How can I help? Is there any way to play this? Look at this? - It's all burnt up! - Burned bad. - Victim of fire! - What happened to it? - What's on it? - That's what I want to find out. If there's a little girl's voice. See you later. A little girl? Can you play it? Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Give it back! Please! Keiko, what are you doing?! It was exactly like you said! She's a murderer! I found it in her room! She killed her teacher to get it! She killed Fuyuko too! I've known about it all along! I can't let her kill again! I'm her mother! - If I kill her, I'll die too! - Help! Stop! She's only a child! Alice! Alice, forgive me! - Forgive me! - So you're the one who stole it? I thought Ryoko had taken it. It's mine! I hate you! I wish I had died then... I wish I had died when your father killed himself! I hate you! Alice! Love? Yes... she didn't kill Fuyuko just for the veil. Alice loves Koji. She didn't want to give him away. She loves him? He is her uncle. As a woman loves a man. Really!? But why? I think it has something to do with my husband's suicide. She was four years old... - Mom! - What is it? - Dad's spinning round and round! - What? It was sudden and unexpected. I still have no idea why he did it. In that way. We were almost too happy. She thought her father had rejected her. She started to cling to Koji. She started to show an abnormal attachment to things. That's when it started. It was a fear of loss. I know the feeling. From then on, everyone who tried to take something from her died. That's why I was worried about you. I knew that my brother loved you. She threatened you about the veil. She scared you with the wedding dress. She was trying to chase you out. Sometimes it frightened me to see how she stared at you. Ryoko... Please leave this house and marry Koji. It will be better for all concerned. What will happen to Alice? I'll have to do something. Alice doesn't know the difference between good and evil. She's sick. You should talk to Dr. Tsukahara. He's very good. Maybe I will. I'll check on Alice. OK, then... do you need help? - I'm all right, thank you. - Then I'm going to take off. I think I should go back to the house. I might be able to play this. Nobody answered the phone... That's strange. - Thanks for the favor. - No problem. Alice! Alice! Ryoko, you got lucky. Alice, what did you do to your mother?! Uncle Koji is the only one I need. That's why I can't give him to you. Alice? Alice! Alice! Open this door! Open this door! Alice, let me out. This is where your story ends. Die! Stay away! Koji! Ryoko! Ryoko! Koji! Koji! Koji. Everything's all right now. What happened to Alice? You're in the hospital. - With Dr. Tsukahara? - That's right. You saved my life. A few seconds later and I would have wound up like Keiko. I know. - What happened to the tape? - I was able to listen to it. Did Alice say that she had killed people? I heard it. Ryoko, I.... Don't worry, Alice is sick. Dr. Tsukahara can help her. You're right. Koji. Ryoko, I'll visit you again soon. Just rest and don't worry so much. Thank you, goodbye. Koji!!! In the end, nobody believed what I said. No one could believe that an 8-year old was a murderer. - I was just thinking of something fun. - Well... I'm not going to give them for free. - I was just thinking of something fun. - Well... I guess that's all we get. I'm not going to give them for free. I was just thinking of something fun. I might spend the rest of my life here. But for some reason I feel at peace with myself. I feel oddly suited to this cell. Maybe it's because in some way... I died together with Johann on that day. I think that I actually killed Johann because I wanted his love. In the same way, Alice kept killing people... out of a longing for and a thirst for love. When you love someone too much, your love can snuff them out. Sweet Alice, a criminal of love. Some people would call such a person a devil... but I wonder if Alice could be called a "cute devil". What are you thinking about, Alice? I was just thinking about fun games we could play.
