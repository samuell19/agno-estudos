For someone like Luzviminda Catacutan it is true that only a mother can love her children whole heartedly. She accepted all that the Lord has given her without hesitation. If you only knew what I went through. I still remember when I was about to give birth to my eldest son Oscar. I was with his father Jonathan, who is a soldier. I thought it was the end of my life. Come on, move faster! Wait a minute! Move faster, let's go! Wait for me! I'm pregnant! Please spare me! Hey, pregnant woman! I don't believe you're pregnant. You're a man, aren't you? You're just pretending. Maybe you're a spy. I'm a woman. I'm pregnant. I'm not gay. She's a spy. Kill her! Why did you leave me? They've mistaken me for a man. It's your fault. Why did you come here? Our baby might turn into a war freak. Hide! He mistook me for a man? I'm so beautiful. There's nothing wrong with being a gay. But I am not gay. I am a woman! I am not gay! Me too! May the Lord bless you. You may now kiss the bride. Through God's mercy we're alive as well as our son but... our love was waylaid. He left me for a fat woman. I didn't know that's what you like. I shouldn't have gone on a diet. Ouch! Ouch! What's the matter? I'm Marco. You're so beautiful. You're one of a kind. My hair is straight. So let it shine! I'm Luz. My son, you have a new father. Let's go. As the saying goes, &quot;When God closes a window, he opens another window.&quot; Marco accepted me even if I already had a child. Who am I to refuse him, no matter what his job is? Our love soon bore a child, Orson. Here's some more. There's plenty of it. Here's 60 pesos, additional... Here's a camera. With one click, you're all set. It's worth 700 pesos. Here's a pager. You're just one call away. It's worth 350 pesos. That will do. Here's another pager, worth 300 pesos. Marco! But like my love for Jonathan then Marco also left me. You killed him. You killed him. He's a cop-fearing man. We caught him trying to steal a car. He even exchanged fire with us. That's not true! That's not true! He's just joking. He's a joker. You took it seriously. Is this a joke? We got many wallets from him, even a ladies bag. This? It belongs to my friend Alma. This belongs to another friend, and this, too. While this belongs to Andoy. What's your problem? They all belong to our close friends. It's not true! It is not true! It's not true! He's a born-again Christian. Marco, I'm pregnant. So when I gave birth to my youngest son, Orwell, I decided to leave our province. Our life there was so difficult so I thought we might have a peaceful life in Manila. - Where we can start a new life. - Give that to me! That's mine! Give that to me! Stop that. Give that to him. You're older. It's always him. Don't worry, I'll buy you toy guns and trucks. Yes! Okay! Mommy, can we still curl this? Okay, we'll buy some curlers. Yeah, thank you mommy. Miss, stand up. What happened? Come here. Sit down. What happened? The Lord is still good to me. I met Maritess in the pawnshop where I pawn my jewelry. The pawnshop where she worked closed down. And she was paid only with cheap forfeited jewelry. That's when I thought of how we can make a living. Are you getting all these? You need to pay for all of them. Of course. Just don't increase your interest. Using the jewelry paid to Maritess, I learned to sell jewelry. Until I was in the buy and sell business. Don't belittle that. I was able to send my kids to school because of that. (Maritess screams) Look at your kid's drawing! Mommy, are they pretty? Yes, they are pretty. Oh no, my kid might become a Pitoy Moreno. No, Oscar Peralta. Look at the styles in his drawing. Never mind. Oscar, you're going to be an architect or engineer someday, right? Yes, Mommy. You will build bridges, museums, churches, buildings, and so on and so forth. We have so many bridges already. Are you getting all these? Yes, don't worry. Maritess, you still owe me for your earrings. Why don't we just go on a date? I don't like you. Oscar was able to graduate. Come here. - Let's have our pictures taken. Okay, all of you pose for a picture. One, two, three! Include me in the picture. - One, two... - Oscar! - Ma, this is my girlfriend, Pauleen. - Hello. My mom and this is my brother, Orson, - and this is my other brother, Orwell. - Hello. - This is my grandmother. - Hello. - This is Maritess. - Hello. Come on. Let's have another picture. One, two, three. Let's have a picture of the graduates. Okay. Okay, smile. One, two, three. Take our picture. Okay, join you mother. Okay, ready. One, two, three. And my Orson, despite of his appearance he brought home many honors. Best in sports, long distance running... best oration as school debater. And the winner is Orson Castello. Varsity member of the school cheering squad. He's really great! I was also able to send to school my youngest son, Orwell. I can't ask for more. There's a film shoot. Let's take a look. Cut! Oh, there's one more. Another chance at love. That's how my happy family was completed. Orson, come on, I'll be late for work. - Orson! - Will you please wait a minute? You've been there for hours. Can you move faster? What are you doing there? I'm taking a bath. What else would I do inside the bathroom? Will you get out of my way? Mother! Mother! What happened'? What are you doing there? Mother, did you see what Oscar did to me? He pushed me. He rubbed my face against the wall. He punched me several times. What would be my chances to win Miss Universe? If I had marks on my legs. It's your fault! You always use the bathroom ahead of him even if he goes to work earlier. I'm always wrong. Oscar is always right. I'm your only teenage daughter. You always favor that stag. Where is justice? Hey, Orson, will you please come here? Yes, Mother? Shoo, just go inside! My children are crazy! Where is justice? Hmm, that's okay. An intelligent gay! - Good morning sir. - I'm sorry I'm late. Did they already pour cement at the third floor? They're about to mix it. Engr. Pengson is supervising them. Okay. You move faster. Bring that inside. Will you please wear your uniform? I don't care if it's hot. What is important is no one gets hurt. Yes, sir. You heard what our boss said. Wear your uniform. - Good morning. - Good morning. Someone might see us. It's just a kiss. It's like you were raped. Sorry, I just felt upset earlier. Happy 7th anniversary to you! Happy anniversay. Why were you irritated earlier? Is it because of Orson again? Why bother him? Because he's so gay. - Then what do you call us? - Shh. Nun? Adrian, we're different. Happy anniversary. This is beautiful. My gift for you is inside the car. Do you know I should have gotten the gift from your mother? But she might notice when you wear it. Thank you. Architect Pengson. You're now needed at the third floor! We're going out! We're coming! What's wrong? The tone of my voice changed. You're always joking. I'm now okay, brother. Let's go! I'm telling you that shaving is good. Don't buy cream over the counter. They're full of chemicals, and your skin will get dark. And I'm telling you some things will grow out of your skin. Disgusting! Not like shaving which has no side effects. Your skin might be flawless but, your face and body have a different color. Beauty contests don't like that! You'll lose, and remember your skin tone. Hey, what are you doing? You might be late. Mother, I'm still explaining the power of shaving to my little brother. - Stop joking! - Why would you explain it to him? He's not gay! Mother! Just as they say, you can never tell. Oh, excuse me. I'm not yet finished with my beauty rituals. Hey, what are you doing? Nothing, I'm just trying to... Come here outside. Your food seems delicious. - Hi! - Hi. - Hi Oscar. - Hi Adrian. - Hi. - How are you? - I bought you something. You should have told us so we don't need to buy our food. Of course, I know you both. You're growing boys and you need all the energy. What do you want? I have vegetables here. Do you like this? Okay? - What happened to him? - Nothing, he just got something stuck in his throat. It's okay. Thank you. I wish both of you would get choked! - What happened to him? - Don't bother him. Are you okay? Miss Universe 1974! Miss Spain! What else did Margie Moran win aside from Miss Universe 1973? Was there anything else? Fools, don't you know? Miss Photogenic. Yeah, right. I know that! - It's my love. I'll go ahead.- Bye. - I missed you, Marky. - I told you best friends don't do that. - What can they say if we're sweet? You're late. I'm so hungry. You're so sweet. I envy you. You're like lovers. I told you so. Lovers? Wait for me! Mommy! Mommy, are we still going to wait for Orson? Yes, he asked us to wait for him. Son, are you gay? I will not get mad. Look at Orson. Only the female part is missing. There's no problem as long as you tell me the truth. No, I'm not gay! Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure I'm not gay. I'm not gay! My God! Thank God! Come here. You know, for me, no matter what you are, robber, murderer. There's nothing wrong because I love you. Always remember that. Orson is gay so if you'll turn out to be one, it's okay. When I see you wearing my bra and blouse one day, at least I'll be prepared. It's okay if both of you are gay because your eldest brother Oscar is a real man. He'll just be the one to continue our bloodline. Your Uncle Gerry and I might not have anymore children. Why? Don't ask! He's infertile? My son is not gay! It's five minutes to five. Pauleen is asking me when are we going to get married. Who is going to wear the bridal gown? - Adrian! - No, I'm serious. This has gone far enough! You know, this is all your fault. If you did not fight me then, I should have not courted her in the first place. That was six year ago. We're already on our seventh year. What should I do? Do you know what you should do? Drink that soft drink with the commercial &quot;Be yourself.&quot; That's all! This jewelry is so beautiful. The design is so unique and the cut is so intricate. Mrs. Annabelle, how many carats is this? That's three and a half carats but they're real diamonds. They're a rare type of Baby South Sea. The earrings are one carat but you have to get the whole set. Luz, do you think you can now sell those expensive sets? Take these. They're cheaper, less than two carats. Do you like them? Mrs. Annabelle, allow me to get up the ladder. I'm tired of my small commissions. You know I feel that... - Oh! - You're not being careful. - I'm sorry Mrs. Annabelle. I need to pay for a lot of things. - Sorry! Luz, you should be more careful. - Where is the earring? - There, it's underneath the table. - Here's another one. Take this. - I'm sorry Mrs. Annabelle. Ma'am, drinks. So elegant! The pearls are so beautiful! Why are you wearing that? It went out. I thought you don't want it anymore. Give me that. Remove that! That's not for you! You're always meddling with my things. I feel that this is my chance to get rich! How much is this? It's seven million but it will sell easily at eight or nine million. I don't accept checks. There should be a collateral and I need a title. Ma'am, I have a title. - Will you please get out of my sight? Don't interfere here. - Yes, ma'am. Title? Our maid said that she will show me her breasts on my birthday. You're so lucky! Orwell, have you taken advantage of your maid? I have one but she's not my type. - Maybe you're gay. - What? - What did you say? I'm gay? - Yes! - You're so mean! - Why? - You're a jerk! - What? I can't take this. It's so obscene! I thought you are an artist? Yes, but this is disgusting! I have Bonamine here but it's only for dizziness. My God, she's so dark! - What? - Come here! Come here! Girl, will you cover that up? - Your brother is in a fight. - Where? Let's go! Brother, stop it! Hey, stop it. My child, what happened? - It's his fault! - He raped you? I fought him for the sake of arts! He's the one responsible for this! My child, you've changed! You're now a lesbian! You saw what happened because of your homosexuality, Orson? Excuse me, my name is Ursula. Orwell also gets into trouble because of you! Orson just defended your brother. Mother, Ursula! Okay, Ursula! Mommy, you also tolerate his foolishness! Now, Orwell's school record was tainted with that scandal! Do you think it's over? What if his classmates take their revenge? Are you always at his side, Orson? I will not answer your questions if you will not call me by my real name. I will hit you! Oscar, stop that! Orwell, take your things. Starting today, you'll sleep in my room. - You might be infected with this gay's insanity! - Stop it! Let's go! Shrek!...Ogre! Mother, why am I at fault when I'm the one who helped Orwell? Don't worry. Tomorrow, I'll talk to Oscar about Orson. That's not what I'm thinking of, Gerry. It's the jewelry I wanted to buy. But it's too expensive. I don't have funds and I need a collateral. Don't worry, if I get my salary, it might help you. This is not small-time, Gerry. I'm thinking of giving the title of the house as a collateral. It's that expensive? Yes. But with just one commission, we'll surely be rich. Think about it. I'll just take a bath. The title! My savoir. He said that? You're so silly! What else did he say? What? Where is the soap? I'll call you later. - The soap? - It's inside Mama's groceries. Okay.

A beautiful nightmare. Oscar is pretty. Even my little sister is not one to be outdone. Fabulous! I should continue. Can I go with you? We're shooting in Makati today. I talked to your Mommy last night regarding your fight with your brother. It's Orson's fault. You know, that's where your brother is happy. Aren't you happy for him? You know, Oscar, not all men are like us. Straight men. - What happened? - It's nothing. You know, I think, Oscar is also gay. - He's OOU. - What's OOU? One of us! Your brother? He's straight. If you had only seen how he looks at Uncle Gerry. My gay radar is moving crazy! I smell it! Starting today, if we have a fight, I'll call him Olga-deville... 1,200 pitbulls. He looks like one. You're thinking everyone is gay. Even myself. Well this time, I'm very much sure. Because if I'm mistaken, I'll have my fingers and toes cut off. You're not being sweet. - Orson! - Girls! It's time for what? It's time for me to pass on to you my crown as Miss Gay! It's posted in the bulletin board. Application for Miss Gay University is now open. Let's join! One and two, and three, and four, and five. He's gone. Never mind. Let's sit down here and talk about it. What did it say? I'm joining for sure. Sorry about what happened yesterday. It's really my fault. - That's okay. - I won't tease you anymore. - We're best friends now. - Sure, best friend. We've decided, we're going through with it. Wow, really? Congratulations! You'll be our best men. It's fine with me but Oscar... he's still hiding behind the closet of our gowns. We're planning a bachelor's party. We're not yet sure about the time and place. - You're invited. - Sure! How about you? When are you tying the knot? Yeah, when? Here it is. If you still can't sell it in two months, just return them to me. We already have a buyer. We're going there after here. That's why I brought him along, as bodyguard. I'll just try it out. That's okay. You're very pretty. - Mrs. Annabelle, does it look nice on me? - Yes, it does. - Lock it tight. - Okay. - Just a minute. - Okay. Wait. I'm coming. Hi, good evening Oscar. - Is Mommy here? - Not yet. - How about Orson and Orwell? - They're here. You smell bad. I smell alcohol. What are you up to this time? Presenting, Miss Gay University! You look lovely! There's no hair in your armpit. You're flawless! Am I pretty? Pretty? You look crazy. Remove that! This is another achievement for me. Good evening, everyone. My name is Estellita Ricaforte Zobel de Ayala Aboitiz Hidalgo Amorsolo y Gokongwei. - You have so many names! - Stop that! - From Argentina. Viva Argentina! - Viva! If ever I win this pageant, I will be the pride of my country. I'd represent and I would promote world peace and eco-tourism. Muchas gracias! Stop that. You're crazy. Remove that, you're embarrassing. Shut up! I'm sure you're envious. You can be the second runner-up. Miss Trinidad. What did you say? Didn't you understand what I said, sister? You're nothing but a second rate trying hard, copycat! Miss Argentina was hit by Miss Trinidad Tobacco. Oh no, wake up, Shawie! Why don't you put those earrings inside the bag? In a while, I'm still feeling pretty. I feel pretty! I feel pretty! - Does it look nice on me? - Yes, it really does. But be careful, that's expensive. Of course! But it's pretty! This is a hold-up. Are you sure? Don't look at your back, I'll kill you. Gerry! What happened to you? You're a stuntman and yet... Give me your watch. Faster! Give it to me, fast! Your earrings. - Not the earrings, please. I'm going to sell this. - Remove them, quick! If you like... you can have my body instead. He's sleeping anyway. Would you like to? No! No! Give me your earrings. Damn you! Remove your earrings! - Okay, okay. Here it is. - Quick! Not the earrings, please! - Wait, do you have a cellphone? - None! How about email? Do you have one? Help! Help! Gerry! My earrings! Ouch, my beautiful eyes! I will report him to the Commission of Violence and Human Rights. I'll get it. Look, you're ugly now! They're here. Mother! Mother! What happened to you? Domestic violence! He punched me. He kicked me. He rubbed my face against the wall, Mother. My face! - My God! Come here. - What will I do? Who did that to you? Who else, your son who thinks he is an action star... fake! What happened here? Your kids were fighting. Orson, here was telling Oscar &quot;you're nothing but a second rate, trying hard, copycat!&quot; - Stop it. - It's true! Then he told him, &quot;you're only a second runner-up&quot;. Of course, Oscar got mad since he's only a second runner-up so he punched him. There, he looks ugly now. My God, why did you do this now? Just when... Love, wait! Love, wait! What happened? They could have been quarreling. Oh, my beautiful eye! That hurts! Love, I'm really sorry. I was afraid that's why I fainted. Bubbles were even coming out of your mouth. It's embarrassing. Stop that! But I know it's really not your fault. How can we pay for the earrings now? Love, I told you not to wear those earrings. So, it's my fault now. Do you want to wear them yourself? No, no. Love, how can we tell your kids? We can't tell them about it, especially to Oscar. Imagine, he paid for this house only to find out I used it as collateral. He'll be mad at me. Why are you crying? Now you know, how big our problem is. No. You stepped on my foot, I have an in-grown. It hurts! Stop that. You're such a hunk yet you're crying because of an in-grown. Stop that. You're a stuntman. Stop crying. Love, how can we pay for it? The Lord does not sleep. Remember M. Remember E. Put them together, remember ME. Huh?! Dream, believe, survive. That's true. Good morning, Miss Argentina. You're looking lovely today. Quiet...quiet. The family that is quiet together has a problem. Fighting! And the winner by default, because Miss Argentina was knocked down last night by Miss Trinidad Tobacco. Stop that, Maritess! Go back to the kitchen. Oscar. Do you know any lending companies? I just need extra funds for my buy and sell business. You can loan from the bank and use the title as collateral. Why, Ma? Oh, nothing. Never mind. I will ask Pauleen to process it. It will only take two days. Where's the title? Never mind. Uncle Gerry and I will manage. - Ma, I know someone. - Who? - But you'll have to use something else as collateral. - What? That one. Use him as collateral. A fake Bruce Willis, so he can leave this place. Lesbian! Rematch! Rematch! Shut up or I'll return you to the pawnshop! Go ahead. You might be late for your excursion. Okay, Ma. - Ma, I know someone. - Don't butt in. Okay. Mommy, Orson and I are leaving. Where's the car? It broke down. Uncle Gerry brought it to the auto shop. How do we go to school? Take a cab. Here... Here's some more. That's for a week's fare. What's wrong with the car? It's a major damage. Go on. Go to school now. Okay, Mommy. We're going now. - Take care. - Yes, Mommy. Why do they have a joint account? That's what they owe them. Mother of Christ! 2 million pesos! Gerry, this type of car cannot be placed as collateral anymore, unless we sell it. It's not possible. Luz' son might look for it. Why, is there a problem? If you only knew... Do you know where I can get a job? Those who rent cars from you might need a driver. I don't have much acting jobs these days. Nobody makes action movies. I know, but I can't offer you anything. But with your type, you can get other jobs. If you're interested. - Can I have three for Mommy and Daddy. - Sure. It's hot. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. She's a sweet daughter. Just like you. How about us? When are we going to have a sweet daughter? Uh, what do you mean? Oscar, don't you think six years is too long for us? Adrian, do you want some barbecue? Later. Hey, I want to join. Oscar, let's eat some barbecue. This is for you. Please help us. I can't promise you. Luz, I'm not sure. You need to pay for the earrings at least. How much is it? I can't promise you, but she might give it to you for only two million pesos? - two million! - two million. Gerry, two million... I can pay the two million by tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes, tomorrow. Special food for a special occasion. What's the occasion? Ma, why is our dinner special tonight? And why did you invite Adrian? You see, I wanted to tell you something, and Adrian is involved. But let's talk about it later. Eat your dinner first. That's delicious, I cooked that. Ma... since we're all here, I wanted to tell you something, too. Is that good news? I badly need good news these days. - Right Gerry. - Yes. - Pauleen and I are getting married. - What? Why? Oscar, have you thought it over? It's costly to get married today. I have my savings. - Maritess, Water please. - Water. Are you alright? I'm happy. I'm so happy they are getting married. Do you really have to go through with it? It is what's right. You're only fooling yourself. You're deceiving Pauleen. Adrian, wait a minute. Where do you plan to get money for your wedding? From our joint account? Just tell me so I can pull out my share. Get out! Adrian! Adrian! What are they fighting about? I don't know. Love, I can't borrow money from Oscar. He'll need the money for his wedding. Love, come here. Don't get mad. Alfred is offering me a job. You won't like it but I'm telling you it's not illegal. And I'm not going to cheat on you. You don't have to know what job it is. Love, so I can help you in some way. Okay, but who else can we borrow from? Hi, my name is Francine Savini and I represent the college of Accounting. I beleive in the saying that beauty might be skin deep, but my skin is very deep. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Ursula Castiglione. I believe in the saying that art transcends life. We will leave this earth and die... But art lives forever! From the College of Fine Arts. - Was it good girls? - You were great! Do you have a gown for the finals? None yet. I'm not sure if I will have one made. Where is your escort, Mark? You know him, he doesn't like this stuff. Of course, he wants the real stuff. - You're not supporting my career. - Sorry, friend. I can't return these until I pay for the earrings. What will I do? And the winner is... Good morning Mother! Good morning. Winner! I like this, I like this! Not that one, I will have to sell that. Wait, Mother... Don't sell it yet. I'll need that for the beauty pageant, remember? Not this one. You were OPM. What's OPM? Oh, promise me! Mother! Oh, Mother. Here. Are you going to lend this to me? No, mother. No! Where did you get this? That's from my savings. I wanted you to keep it for me. I might spend it and nothing will be left for my gown. So Mother, keep it first. And the jewelry, don't sell it yet, okay? I wonder who will design my gown? Inno Soto! Ralph Lauren? I know! Monique Lhuillier! The one who designs for Britney Spears! Elegant! Mother, that hurts! - That's one for Protect the Children. - Sorry. But Monique Lhuillier? That's too expensive, we can't afford that. Mother, it's just a dream! I'm going to school now. Okay. Bye. I know, let's just go to my friend in Kamuning. She accepts rush orders. Excuse me Mother. I don't think I want to be like you. To be Miss Wet Market 1902. Mother, I'm different. Bye. 1902? I'm not 1902! The money! I'm better. - This is better. - I like this one. How about this? Adrian. Come, take a look, which one is good for my wedding gown. Sorry, I'm busy. I can't help you. Oscar can help you in fashion and clothing. - What's with him? - Nothing. He's just busy. This one, for the bridesmaids and flower girls? - It's nice. - Right? - Brother. - Brother? Don't call me that in public. You tell Mommy that I might come home late. Robin and I are going out. My God, after beating up each other, you are friends now. Is that the fad today? Punching before bonding? I love that. Punching before bonding! Okay. Just don't stay out too late. Send me an SMS when you're going home already. Thank you. Let's go! We're bonding! Do you see what I see? Best friend-lover boy, what happened to you? - You're not replying back. You don't show up. - I was just busy. Hi! - Who is she? - This is Gina, this year's Miss I.T. I know she's Miss I.T. but the question is, who is she in your life? Isn't it obvious? His girlfriend. Faggot! We'll go ahead. Curse! Did you see that? Did you hear that? We heard. Sister, that's alright. Don't kill yourself, okay? - There are plenty of men out there, right? - Correct. Girls! Love, what if we give all these to Mrs. Annabelle? So she'll know we've really decided to pay her. Love, not yet. I am planning to add one hundred thousand more. Later, I may be able to add five thousand more. By the way, what is your other job? Don't ask. - Mommy..., Mark preferred a girl over me. - What? This is what I need. Lots of money. No, no. Why do you need lots of money? I will have my own pechay. So I can compete. Go up to your room. Uncle Gerry and I are discussing something here. Go on. You're full of mischief. Here's some pechay. My God, here's another one. Go outside and boil your pechay! What will I use, pork or beef? - Beef, I don't eat pork. - My God. You know, I'm not used to seeing that you and Adrian are not together. He's avoiding me even at work. Who's fault was it? I need to marry Pauleen. - Do you understand? - For what? The priest will bless you only with Holy Water. not a miracle drug that when you get married, you'll turn into a man. I'm doing this for my Mom. I'm the only one shes expecting to give her a grandchild. Why? You're not a chicken, you're not laying eggs. Are you sure it's here? Yes, this is the place. Come here. Come in, quick. Come on, get inside. Are you sure this is it? - Yes, don't worry. - We might get into trouble. No. Come on. Go on. There are plenty of lovely ladies inside. They look like my grandmother. Hey boys, are you circumcised? You're too young. We want to become men. Do you want that, too? I want to be a boy. Do you have money? - Yes, we have. - Can I see? Get out! Get out! Help us! What's that? Sorry, I had to take a leak. Okay, let's go outside. Ma'am, next time, tell your kid to study first, - and not do such foolishness. - Yes, sir. Mommy, I'm sorry... Uncle Gerry, Brother. Good thing, nothing bad happened to you. This is an added expense. You're still young, you should have used your hands instead. - Stop that! - It's costly! Next time, you tell me. I know where to bring you. I know where you should be baptized. As long as you're a boy. Let's go. Don't worry. If you win Miss Gay University, you're equal with Miss I.T. Exactly, with a face like this? Beautiful! Don't be too proud. I'm the reigning Miss Beauty Queen. - So I'm the prettiest. - That was before. Now it's my turn. - I'm first. - He's second place. - Why? - Nothing. Why would you think we were laughing at you? We are gays but we are not stupid. Yeah, right. Don't think that Marky will prioritize you over me. I'm not planning on competing against you. He was mine first. Well, he's no longer yours. He's mine now. You took everything from him. No, it's the other way around, substitutes! (insulting Gina...) In other words, you're ugly! Don't worry. One of these days, Marky will realize that you're a bird villain. Oh, really? Well, I'm the chosen one. Faggot! Gina! She started it. Still, she's a girl, and you? Me, what am I? Why can't you say it? Why can't you say it? What am I? Gay? Gay! Orson! Orson! You should not have fought back. Whatever happens, Marky is right. You're still a boy and Gina is a girl. Mother, I'm the one who understands him. What about him? I'm the one who loves him. He doesn't reciprocate. I'm sure Marky loves you but in his own way. I hope you can just accept and remember it. A man is still meant for a woman. I fought for him but he did not fight for me. Love hurts. I don't want this anymore. What? What? What, have you gotten out of your madness? I can now understand how you feel. I'm sorry. I still need a lot. I have just one more month. Luz, tell your kids. No, we can do this. - We can do this, Gerry, right? - Yes, love, we can manage. My kids have a lot of problems already. Oscar is getting married. Orson has problems with his best friend. While Orwell is having difficulty facing his adolescence. So, I'm handling this on my own. - We can do this, right, Gerry? - Yes, love. Hello. Good thing you called. Do you have a higher-paying job for me? I will do anything. When is that? Luz! Luz! Gerry! Luz fainted. Love, what happened to you? Fainted? Maybe she's pregnant. - Love, are you pregnant? - No, I'm not. She fainted twice. Congratulations! She's having twins. Oh my God, I'm not prepared! Ma'am, you're having psychosomatic disorders. We did not find any illness. Do you have any problems? Yes, doctor, worth two million pesos. You're kidding. I'll go ahead. Love, this is another expense. You should tell your kids. You keep your problems to yourself and look at what happened to you. I was so nervous when you fainted, I need to pee. Don't worry, love, I've talked to Oscar. He said, he'll pay for all our expenses here. You know, Maritess is right. You should tell your kids. - Okay class, that's all for today. See you next week. - Okay sir, bye. Marky, tell your violent girlfriend to stop pestering me. Sorry. Gina, he's not bothering you anymore. Excuse me, I just wanted to wish him luck in the Miss Gay University. Can't I do that? How sweet! As if it's true. Is it April Fool's Day? So what is your punchline? I just thought, a duck, even if you scratch it on the ground, even if it crows even if you enter it in a cockfight, it is still a duck. Do you think if you win in the Miss Gay University, we'll be equal? The one I joined is a serious contest. Yours is just for fun. Wow! Impressive. She knows a lot about ducks. Are you from Pateros? Orson, sorry. I don't know why she's so mad at you. Is our friendship true, Marky? Or was it just for fun? Good bye... Thank you for the flowers. Promise me, whatever happens, you won't tell this to Oscar. But Mommy, he can help you. He'll need the money for his wedding to Pauleen. Mother, remember the money I told you to keep? It's yours. I have saved some more. It's yours as well. No, that's for your gown. Gown... Yes, I can buy a gown, but you will not be able to watch. Because you'll be put to jail. One more thing, I don't want to join that contest. Gina might be right that she can be the only girl in Marky's life, and I'm just a boy best friend. Are you going to act like a man now? Of course not, I did not say anything like that. I will just act like a boy so he'll not be ashamed of me. So I won't be joining that contest now. Come in. Are you hitting me again? No. Mommy told me about what happened to you and Marky. Don't jump for joy yet... Mommy might not have told you, whatever happens, I'm still gay. I'm just doing this for Marky. You really love him. Yes. Even if I look like a man, it's fine with me. I'm going nuts. I don't know why I fell in love with him. You know, tying a tie is just like love. At the start, you don't know what to do. You'll get tangled. You won't know where to go into and where to get it out. And sometimes, you have to start all over again and find another way but as time goes by you'll know what's right. What's the right thing to do? Lovingly yours, Charo Santos-Concio. You don't have a mole. You're really crazy. You're so full of mischief. I should have known, I'd be hit again. I shall disappear now. Girl, it doesn't suit you. You look like Aiza. - Shh! - Sorry, ma'am. You're like a man. It doesn't suit you. You look like ground pepper. - Shh! - Sorry, ma'am. Orson, why do you look like that? - You don't like it? - I'm just not used to it. I know why. He wants to please you, but he can't compete with me. That's why. Yes, you're right Gina. I'm a duck, you're a chicken and I know I won't be a goose like Marky. Forgive me. I just wish your chicken will be hit by lightning, so it will become a roasted chicken. ...or anecdotes. - What? - You don't have pressure. What are you saying? You should press that first. Sorry, sorry, sorry. - What does it say? - Northeast 250 degrees. - What northeast? - Oops, it's a compass. Can you call someone who knows how to use that? We are all witnesses to this union of Ruelle and Rowen. You may now seal your vows with a kiss. - Thank you Father. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Adrian. Will you marry me? What? How about Pauleen? I'll break up with her. I will. I do. When are we going to tell your mother? Let's take this one step at a time. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... What are you doing here? Cher and Frida told me that you're backing out. What's it to you? It's my choice and I'm not doing it because of you. I'm sick and tired of running after you. And if you can't accept what I am, like before because you have your Gina, I do not care. I can live by myself. The best, the best sister. Then my fight with Gina will be put to waste. Because I told her whatever happens, I will still be your escort. What are friends for? Bogacious! I'm envious! Sorry for everything I did. - I missed you. - Me too. I thought you'll be gone from my life. But I really can't join the contest. I don't have money. I lent it to my mother because she had a problem. Okay, I'll take care of it. This is really great, sister! I'm envious! Take it off! Uncle Gerry, what are you doing here? Give this to him. Thank you. What about your wedding with Pauleen? I'm breaking up with her. Are you going to tell your mother? You, are you going to tell Mommy what you do here? This is for her sake. Uncle Gerry... You're a cake boy for gay weddings for Mommy? Come on. Be true to yourself then I'll do it as well. You had a relationship with Adrian first, before us. Did you love me? But not like the love you have for Adrian? Why did you let me on? I'm sorry. I know you can never forgive me. You're a bastard! I know. I should not have done this to you. But this is better than you'll only know I'm gay after we get married. That's more painful. Thank you. I'm free, but I'm already committed. That's okay, Sir. You're so pretty! You've got many muscles just like your mother. I'll return you to the agency! But she's really pretty, right? That's so perfect for your talent portion. Yes, he looks like Diana Ross. No, he looks like one of the members of Menudo. What's that? It's not in my generation. That's during your mother's days. That's your generation as well. Mother, by the way, tell Oscar your problem now. If you don't tell him, I will. I'm still waiting for the right time. Right time? Your time is already up! Your check might have been deposited already to the bank. In any moment, the police will arrive and arrest you. I agree. Okay, later during dinner. I promised your mother I won't tell you her problems. Because she wants to tell you this herself. But if you're going to tell her the truth, then I promise I'll also tell her what I do. I'm just finding the right time. Right time? You've already told Pauleen and everyone but not your mother. Okay, later during dinner. - Love. - Mommy. I'll get the door. Oh, it's Pauleen. Has Oscar told you our wedding has been called off? Pauleen, I was about to tell her. Mommy, don't get mad. I have something to tell you. - I'll get it. - Wait. Your son is gay and here's your wedding gown. Someone is looking for you. What happened here? I was just about to buy some jewelry. Is Mommy still mad? She's been waiting for you. She had a heart attack because of me. You don't know the whole story why this happened to mother. It will be better if she tells you herself. You know, I'm ashamed. I was so mad with your being gay but... That's okay. I was really puzzled why our house was so slimy. Why I should have been the only gay. Aren't you mad at me? Of course not, I'm so proud of you. You've finally been true to yourself. Excuse me, Sir. Sisters! Sorry. They are already looking for you. Let's go. ♪ We are sisters ♪ ♪ We are soft-hearted and strong-willed ♪ ♪ We are sisters ♪ I've told this to Orwell before, and I'm telling this to you as well. Even if you are the meanest person in the world I love you because you are my son. Ma,... I'm sorry. I won't be able to give you a grandchild. That's okay. You'll never know. Your Uncle Gerry and I might still get lucky. He has also told me his other job. But he has not told you why he is doing that job. It's for me. We were held up, and they got the earrings I was about to sell worth two million pesos and I used the house as collateral for my loan. If I don't have enough fund for the check tomorrow, they will foreclose on our house. I might be put in jail. Ma, that's only money. You should have told me at once. Sorry. Just a minute. Just a minute. Adrian, can I borrow the money in our joint account? We just need it to pay Mommy's loan. I'll be the one to pay for your share. What's mine is yours. Thank you. Thank you. She accepted everything God has given her without any hesitation. And to honor the exceptional love she has shown her sons; Oscar, Orson, and Orwell. This year Luzviminda Catacutan is being honored as one of the Mother of the Year awardees of the Department of Psychology of this university. Friends, let's welcome her with a big round of applause.

Candidate number three...Miss Ursula Castiglione. Orson fulfilled his dream of becoming Miss Gay University. (Flower's were presented to Miss Gay University) (Reigning Miss Gay University relinquishes crown to the new Miss Gay University) The wedding of my eldest son, Oscar, pushed through. A love that knows the weakness of man. A selfless love. A love that will love all that symbolizes you. A love that knows no bounds. Even death. Long live the newlyweds! Ma, thank you. - Where are the magazines? - Here. Orwell is soon becoming a woman. - He's a hunk. - Check this out. They are what he has given me and I'll accept them whole heartedly. No questions.
