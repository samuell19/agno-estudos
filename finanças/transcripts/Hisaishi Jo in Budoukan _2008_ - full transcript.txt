Like a cutlass-blade exquisite, Sharpened to beautiful point, Like your own silhouette that traced a line Carving out your sidelong visage. Lurking in the sadness and the rage, Hides your true heart That’s buried deep within, Known only to The soul of the woods, Only vengeful spirits Would know Lurking in the sadness and the rage, Hides your true heart that’s buried deep within, Known only to The soul of the woods, Only vengeful spirits Would know Kiki’s Delivery Service: A Town with an Ocean View A scenic view of light crimson blooms, A springtime that has known of misery The petals wilt and fall with the wind, Whose fingertips will send them tumbling forth. In silence there the waves can be seen, A summer day awash in brilliant light. But if they reached the coast of my heart, They’d crash and turn into the whitest foam. As the ever-changing seasons come and go, At the end of them who’s standing there alone? Your swaying feelings were the only thing That held you tight and close, all alone No matter what tomorrow may bring, With head atop your hands by window-side, From there, we’ll surely seek out a dream We’ll go and catch a dream without a form. Kiki’s Delivery Service: Heartbroken Kiki Kiki’s Delivery Service: Mom’s Broom Joe Hisaishi Presents the Orchestra and Choruses Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea: Deep Sea Ranch Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea: Mother of the Sea, Vocal: Masako Hayashi In the deep, pelagic blue Lilies sway to and fro. I spoke with the multitudes Of your little siblings Innumerable, in a language Made of bubbles undersea. And do you remember back when? So long ago in the past, You and I used to live all together, Long ago, within the deep ocean blue. There with jellyfish, sea urchins, And with fish, and with crabs You were siblings, All the same back then. And do you remember back when? So long ago in the past, You and I used to live all together, Inside the quiet of the deep ocean blue. In the deep, pelagic blue Lilies sway to and fro. You recall how limitless Was your sisterhood! Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea: Ponyo of the Fish of the Wave Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea. Fujimoto’s Theme, Vocals: Fujioka Fujimaki Tell me, where’d you run And throw away your dream? Tell me, when did you Forget about your love? These eyes won’t cry for you — No tears will they let fall. Up above you’d have to toil Day by day Stumbling aimlessly, One moment to the next When your neglected hope Would only set you free. Spirits abound In the town square None showing you Which way will lead onward, Which way leads back — How shall I ever find my way home? Lest I cause a soul The slightest twinge of pain In my heart I couldn’t bear to feel the hurt I’d scurry silently, Far out into the cold. Spirits abound In the town square None showing you Which way will lead onward, Which way leads back — How shall I ever find my way home? Solid coral And the woman aren’t alike She is beautiful Yet fleeting as a smile That’s why I always want To keep you safe from harm. All-accepting, All-embracing is the sea All-forgiving Is the ocean’s mother-love That’s why again I must Return to her once more Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea: Rondo of the Sunflower House, Vocals: Mai How fervent my wish — But once again to walk unfettered How I’d clean, how I’d wash Ever so much as I could How I’d dive into the laundry, How I’d gladly tend the kitchen How I’d then go outside And take a walk. Why delay until the rain Goes away — it’s bright and clear Yon Sun-goddess too — There she smiles, just like me I love rainy days too — I’ll take my stylish new umbrella And my rain coat As I go out for a stroll. So long as I stand shy Of my concluding hour Please let me walk For this short time before finally I go Oh how I long to dance, if even just Once more, graceful as a gentle breeze So long as I stand shy Of my concluding hour I’d love it even if I could Just blow on the window-glass Oh how I long to dance, if even just Once more, graceful as a gentle breeze.

Laputa: Castle in the Sky | Pigeons and a Boy with Marching band Laputa: Castle in the Sky | Carrying you with Choir The horizon’s stars aglow With light from up above, Hidden somewhere out of view, There must you dwell, up in the sky. When the sky is all agleam, The nostalgia fills my soul For well I know — On one of those stars — Shimmering, Must you dwell. Let our journey start from here With a slice of bread you baked, With a knife and a lamp inside your bag — All you’ll need to take. My father bequeathed to me This flaming soul I feel, My mother bestowed on me This gaze with which I seek. As the world goes round and round, Hiding you in its embrace, Bright illumined are your eyes — They twinkle lucidly and shine. As the world goes round and round And carries you aloft, Someday I know we’ll meet again, As it carries you and me. The horizon’s stars aglow With light from up above, Hidden somewhere out of view, There must you dwell, up in the sky. When the sky is all agleam, The nostalgia fills my soul For well I know — on one of those stars — Shimmering, must you dwell. Let our journey start from here With a slice of bread you baked, With a knife and a lamp inside your bag — All you’ll need to take. My father bequeathed to me This flaming soul I feel, My mother bestowed on me The gaze with which I seek. As the world goes round and round, Hiding you in its embrace, Bright illumined are your eyes — They twinkle lucidly and shine. As the world goes round and round And carries you aloft, Someday I know we’ll meet again, As it carries you and me.

Beyond the far horizon, Continuing unbroken As if they knew What lies ahead. I remember how shallow Was my every breath And how coolly The breeze was caressing My impassioned cheek Now the future draws apace, Here uncurl my folded limbs Disentangled from their tie By a quiet voice. So devoutly to be wished, Crying out in earnest plea For that one and only life, Warm midsummer’s glowing light, Filtering through every branch — Upon your shoulder, sunlight falls. A fragile cluster-ball Of whiteness Its petals scatter, Borne aloft on the wind. And a couple there are floating On an immaterial river That sings out its song As it courses along. Every secret, each falsehood, Every happiness Is a child of the deities That gave birth To the Universe. Here the future draws apace, Now my trembling heart awakes, Someday soon it will recall Its forgotten name. So devoutly to be loved, Crying out in fervent plea For that one and only life, Our place of safe return, Here on my hand shall arrive That everlasting summer day. Spirited Away / “Reprise,” Vocals: Ayaka Hirahara So long ago now, How long it has been Since I last knew that feeling Of a warm and steady glow. I lost sense of my way As I went along I could not hide my tears, How I felt truly all alone. When I gathered my resolve And set out once again, A stream of light glimmered softly From where the door rested open, and It beckoned me Beguilingly. Into the azure Above let us soar, May we never let the link Of our hands be pulled apart The road that you unveiled to me And guided me along, Now I am walking all on my own, Looking always straight ahead Aspiring ever Unweariedly. Never forgetting, Devoutly I hope — Someday we’ll be reunited, I know deep in my heart. Thus far you’ve led me, And shown me the way. Every day you shine on my path, You’re my light eternally … Tonari no Totoro: The Path of the Wind Deep inside of the forest, The breath of wind is born Where an elm tree Is standing all alone, by itself Surreptitiously tickling, It floats on by That’s the pathway Of the spirit of the wind Tonari no Totoro: Stroll, Vocals: Chorus All guest singers Hey let’s stroll, hey let’s stroll — I’m feeling hearty and hale! Taking a stroll — I love it so Dum, dum, We will go. Sauntering through hill and dale, Grass and tunnels too, O’er a bridge we go, and on the grav’lly roads we walk. Crawling under spiderwebs, Down the hill we run. Hey let’s stroll, hey let’s stroll — I’m feeling hearty and hale! Taking a stroll — I love it so, Dum, dum, We will go. Honeybees buzz — hear them hum — in a field of blooms, Here a lizard takes a nap, And there a snake in shade, Yonder locust hops along, On the winding road. Hey let’s stroll, hey let’s stroll — I’m feeling hearty and hale! Taking a stroll — I love it so Dum, dum, We will go. Foxes come out, raccoon-dogs too, All come out and play, Deep into the woods, On a safari we shall go, All together with our friends — happiness complete.
