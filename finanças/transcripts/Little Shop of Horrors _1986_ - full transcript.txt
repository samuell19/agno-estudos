Ah! So, she finally decides to come to work! Uh, good morning, Mr. Mushnik. What morning? It's almost closing time. Not that we had a customer. Seymour, what in the name of God is going on down there? Uh, Audrey, would you go down and see what he's... Audrey. Audrey, where did you get that shiner? Uh... uh, shiner? Audrey, that greasy boyfriend of yours is beating up on you again? Look, I know it's none of my business but I'm beginning to think he's maybe not such a nice boy. I got these pots unloaded for you, Mr... Seymour, look what you've done to the inventory! Don't yell at Seymour, Mr. Mushnik. - Hi, Audrey. You look radiant today. - Oh. Is that new eye makeup? Oh. I'll help him clean it up before any of the customers get here. That should give you plenty of time. Oh, God, what an existence I got. Misfit employees, bums on the sidewalk. Business is lousy. My life is a living hell! Hey, you. Urchins! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Move! Move! Move! Go away! No loitering! Man, I wasn't loitering. Were you, Crystal? Not me, Ronette. Were you, Chiffon? You ought to be in school! Yeah, well we on a split shift. Right! We went to school until fifth grade, then we split. So? How do you intend to better yourselves? Better ourselves?

I'm closing this God-and-customer-forsaken place. - Ah. - Mr. Mushnik... Forgive me for saying so, Sir, but has it ever occurred to you... That maybe what the firm needs is to move in a new direction? Uh, what Seymour's trying to say is... Uh, Seymour, why don't you run downstairs and bring up that strange and interesting new plant you've been working on? You see, Mr. Mushnik... Some of those exotic plants Seymour's been tinkering around with... Are really unusual. And we thought maybe some of those strange and interesting new plants prominently displayed and advertised, would attract business. I'm afraid it isn't feeling very well today. There. Now, isn't that bizarre? At least. What kind of a weirdo plant is that, Seymour? I don't know. I think it's some kind of flytrap but I haven't been able to identify it in any of my books. I gave it my own name though. I call it an Audrey II. - After me? - I hope you don't mind. Ah! You see, Sir, if you were to put a strange and interesting plant like this here in the window, then maybe... Maybe what? Maybe what? Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Just because you put a strange and interesting plant in the window, people don't suddenly... Excuse me. I couldn't help noticing that strange and interesting plant. - What is it? - It's an Audrey II. I've never seen anything like it before. No one has. Where did you get it? Well... You remember that total eclipse of the sun about a week ago? ♪ Da-doo. ♪ I was walking in the wholesale flower district that day. ♪ Shoop da-doo. ♪ And I passed by this place where this old Chinese man, ♪ Chang da-doo. ♪ he sometimes sells me weird and exotic cuttings. ♪ Snip da-doo. ♪ Because he knows, you see, that strange plants are my hobby. ♪ Da-da-da da-da da-doo. ♪ He didn't have anything unusual there that day. ♪ Nope, da-doo. ♪ So I was just about to, you know, walk on by. ♪ Good for you. ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, she-shoo-bop shoo-bop. ♪ When suddenly, and without warning, there was this: ♪ Total eclipse of the sun. ♪ It got very dark.

Oh, while I'm here, I might as well take $50 worth of roses. Fifty dollars? Can you break a hundred? A hundred? Uh, no. Well, then I'll just have to take twice as many, won't I? Twice as many? - Twice as many? - Twice as many! That plant in the window, it's simply amazing! That plant in the window, wherever did you get it? - Look, there it is, Marge. - Oh, my gosh, it's peculiar. Aah. Thank you! Thank you very much, Sir! Thank you! Thank you! Come again! Come and look at the weirdo plant some more! It's just gonna get bigger and more interesting. What, what, what? Just don't stand there! Quick, quick! Put the plant back in the... Oh, what did you call it? Audrey II. Put that Audrey II back in the window where the passersby can see it. Oh, my God! I never thought this could happen! Oh, my children... I'm taking us all out to dinner tonight! Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Mushnik, but I have a date. With that same "No-good-nik "? I'm telling you, Audrey, you don't need a date with him. You need major medical. He's a rebel, Mr. Mushnik, but he... He makes good money. Besides... He's the only fellow I got. Enjoy dinner. Good night, Seymour. Good night, Audrey. Poor girl. Are we still going out? You're not going anywhere, Krelborn. You're staying right here and taking care of that sick plant! I told you it's been giving me trouble. The Audrey II is not a healthy girl. Strictly between us, neither is the Audrey I. If only I knew what breed it was. Who cares what breed it is? Look what it's done for business. - I know. - So work, Seymour.

I went to a terrible dentist Wednesday, who was recommended to me by somebody that I saw on Monday who is the brother of a man that I usually see on Sundays. And their mother taught them everything they know. She's gifted, but quite elderly. People think she shouldn't be working. But I go to her because I'm just incredibly devoted to her strength. She can't really see who you are, but she knows the sound of your voice. If you tell her where it is, the problem, she eventually finds the trouble and she does it. I wish I had that stamina. I can only go so long. That's how I want to be. I don't ever want to have to be just... Comfy? Yes, doctor. I remember the first time I went to a dentist. I thought, "What a neat job! If only I were a dentist." the dentist I went to had the greatest car. He had a corvette. I thought, "My gosh," everybody calls him 'Doctor, ' and he's not really a doctor." Oh, my God! "If only I got out of here okay." but then after everything was all finished they gave me a candy bar. I thought, "This is what I get?", "A candy bar?" This is what you do. You go through a thing and get chocolate out of it. Getting to work with incredible professionals who use incredibly wonderful equipment... Let's take a look at that mouth. Say, "aah!" Ahhh! Aah, candy bar! Ohh! Candy bar! Candy bar! Oh, that's great. Come on! Gosh! Oh, God. Do it again. Oh, God, doctor. Whoo! Yeah, aw, great! Oh, you are something special. You are something special! Come on! Come on! Come on! Mm, aw, oh! Thank you! Yeah, thank you! Oh, my God. It's your professionalism that I respect. Oh, God! Don't stop, doc! Don't stop! Come on! More! Yeah! Yeah, come on! Yeah! What do you want? Say, "please!" Ah, ah, ah. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. Great! Oh! I'm gonna get a candy bar! I'm gonna get a candy bar! Come on! Come on. Oh, yeah! Yeah, oh! Ah! Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Wow! Oh, yeah! Oh, yes! Yes! Yeah. - Get out. - What's wrong? Get out of here. What's the matter? Go on! Get out of here! Right this way. I'm gonna tell each and every one of my friends about you - and they're gonna... - Just get... - What's this? - Oops. Ha-ha-ha! Sorry. Goddamn sicko. Let me ask you something. Does this thing scare you? - Yes. - Would you like if I took this thing and made straight for your goddamn incisors? - No. - It'd hurt, right? - Mm-hm. - You'd scream, right? - Mm-hm. - Well get your ass in here! - Say, don't I know you? - Seymour Krelborn. We met yesterday. Oh, your mouth's a mess, kid. That wisdom tooth. We'll just rip that bugger right out of there. - What do you say? - No! There's always time for dental hygiene, Seymour. You ever seen the results of a neglected mouth? Look, Seymour. - This could happen to you. - Uh... - Unless I take immediate action. - What's that? - A drill. - It's rusty. It's an antique. They don't make them like this anymore. Sturdy, heavy... Dull. I'm gonna want some gas for this. Thank God. I thought you wouldn't use any. Oh, the gas isn't for you, Seymour. It's for me. You see, I want to really enjoy this. In fact, I'm gonna use my special gas mask. I find a little giggle gas before I begin increases my pleasure enormously. Here we go! Oh, Seymour, I'm flying! The things I'm gonna do to that mouth! Huh? What the hell is that? A gun? The kid's got a goddamn revolver! Oh, Jesus, ha, ha! I'm in trouble now, huh? Wait until I turn this gas off. Uh-oh. Aw, give me a hand, would you? No, I guess you wouldn't, would you? You see, Seymour, I could asphyx... Asphyx... What'd I ever do to you? Nothing. It's what you did to her. Her who? Oh, her. Shh! Go away. Ooh! Chop it up. - What? - Feed me! Okay, okay. Oh, brother. Audrey, what'd they say to you? Uh, who? - The police. - Oh, uh, nothing. Audrey, talk to me. Tell me what they said. It's Orin. They say he's disappeared! - The police, they told you that? - They suspect foul play. They do? His receptionist, this morning she found the place a shambles. Gas masks everywhere. Things all over the floor. They think... I can't even think about what they think. Audrey. Don't cry, Audrey. Would it be so terrible if something had happened to him? Seymour, what a thing to say! Well, would it? It wouldn't be terrible at all. It'd be a miracle. Not to mention all the money I'd save on epsom salts and ace bandages. You see? But I'd still feel guilty. I mean... If he met with foul play or some terrible accident of some kind... That it'd be partly my fault you see because... Secretly I wished it. Audrey, don't you waste another minute thinking about that creep! There's a lot of guys that'd give anything to go out with you. Nice guys. I don't deserve a nice guy, Seymour. - That's not true. - You don't know the half of it! I've led a terrible life. I deserved a creep like Orin Scrivello, D.D.S. You know where I met him? In The Gutter. The gutter? The Gutter. It's a nightspot. I worked there on my nights off when we weren't making much money. I'd put on... Cheap and tasteless outfits, not nice ones like this. Low and nasty apparel. Audrey, that's all behind you now. You got nothing to be ashamed of. You're a very nice person. I always knew you were.

Come and tell our viewers at home and elsewhere about this particularly amazing agricultural phenomenon. A phenomenon, I might add, that has made you one of the most talked-about plant scientists in the country... Cut! What the hell? What happened to the goddamned greenery? - It just needs to be fed. - So feed it. I can't feed it. Not now. Then I'll feed it. Where do you keep the plant food? It doesn't eat plant food. And I can't feed it now. Why don't you leave me alone? All of you. Just go away. Leave me alone. Get out of here. Go away. Leave me alone! - Everybody go away! Leave me alone! - Seymour! You're hysterical. I know. I'm sorry. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? I never should've started, but I did. Now, if I don't feed it, it'll die and I'll lose her, I'll lose everything. - Seymour? Who are you talking to? - Oh. Huh? Nobody. You're acting funny. It wasn't nice throwing those people out. Those men said Seymour Krelborn's Gardening Tips is sure to be a very big TV show. - I know. I'm sorry. I feel terrible. - Well, you shouldn't. They're coming back tomorrow and they're bringing you a great big check. They are? I wish you were enjoying your success. They said they're coming back with money? Tomorrow. Then we could afford to get out of here, couldn't we? Uh, what do you mean? That's it. After tomorrow we could leave here together. Together? If you'll have me. Audrey, will you have me? Uh, what do you mean? Marry me, Audrey. - Oh, Seymour, this is so sudden. - Will you? Sure. Then that's it! We'll go get married right now. - Oh, Seymour! - Tomorrow we'll come back I'll be on television, get the money and then we'll live happy ever after. Oh, Audrey, I'll give you a wonderful life with no plants, I promise. - No plants at all. - You're talking peculiar again, Seymour. We'll start tonight, we'll go to city hall, get married and then spend the night somewhere it's safe. Some nice hotel. - Oh, Seymour. - Oh, Audrey. Oh, I've got to get ready! Heh! Hurry. Hurry. Feed me. - Under no circumstances. - Feed me. I will not, so stop asking. Feed me! No! No more! I can't take living with the guilt. Tough titty. Watch your language. Aw, cut the crap. Bring on the meat. Okay, okay. I'll bring you meat. I'll run down to the corner, pick you up some ground round. - How about that? - Don't do me no favors! - Look. - Hmm? It's my last offer.
