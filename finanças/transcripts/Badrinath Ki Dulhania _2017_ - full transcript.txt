'Hello. Welcome to Jhansi 'Let me introduce you to my family.' Meet my father, Ambernath Bansal... '...and my mother Shanti Bansal.' 'Mom's silent most of the time.' 'My father takes all of the decisions in my life.' 'Right now he's deciding...' '...who is lucky enough to be my bride.' 'This man here, who's anxiously tapping his foot...' '...is the bride's father.' They are here with a marriage proposal for their 'Liability' 'In our country every child's "balance sheet"...' '...is prepared at since the time of his birth.' Congratulations, it's a boy. Boy = Asset! Congratulations, it's a girl! Girl = Liability. 'The birth of an 'Asset' is celebrated with exotic sweets...' '...while the birth of a 'Liability' is only cheered with cheap candies.' 'No matter how useless the boy is...' '...his value keeps growing.' 'And despite how talented the girl maybe...' she's never enters the 'Assets' column. 'And then, a couple of years later...' '...the time finally arrives for their audit report, i.e marriage.' 'The Assets are evaluated...' '...and their ODP, which is 'One-Time Dowry Price' is declared.' 'And these prices are conveyed to the concerned parties...' '...through various agents.' The party's final offer... Right after the engagement, there will be a brand new SUV parked in your garage. Imported. The girl is studying to get a MBA. The party is willing to give five million. And right after the wedding he's promised 10 acres of land... And cash separately. But her qualification won't make any difference to the price. Along with that, she will bring a gold and a diamond set. Just say yes. What more do you want? Snacks are nice! 'And the good-for-nothing 'Asset' they are all referring to...' 'ls me.' Badrinath Bansal... aka Badri. Don't give me that crooked smile. You're not Shahrukh Khan. Now smile properly. A little more. More. Come on. Stop showing your teeth. Little less. Now turn your body. Just your body, not your face. Like in one of those clothing commercials. Yeah... Why are you tapping your feet Stop making me act like a clown! Clown? Soon my company... will be the biggest matrimonial company in all of Jhansi and UP. Think of something else, that's a stupid name. Just wait and watch... I will fix your marriage as well. No thank you, my father will take care of that. By the time your father's priest finds you a bride... you will already have turned 50 Hello! Hello! This fort was built in the 11th Century. Stop, Prakash! Badri has received a call. He knows you're here. Prakash, stop! Otherwise, Badri will come run over you with his motorcycle! Hey, stop. Stop you... Prakash, why are you making my friend run after you? I didn't notice Somdev... If you didn't notice him then why were you running from him? I was just jogging. Dressed like this? Wonderful! Why all the exercise? I am getting married next week. So I thought I should lose some weight. You won't lose weight just by jogging. You know what, start doing sit-ups. I will start tomorrow... 'What you must do tomorrow, do it today...' '...and what you must to today, do it... Now!' Correct. Start. Do you have any intentions of repaying... the 1.5 million you borrowed from my father? I met Alok the other day. I promised to pay him half the amount right after the wedding... and the rest in installments. Promise? Mother promise. Wow... someone's been practicing his English. You see, my would-be wife is a graduate. You're blushing. How do you spell 'GRADUATE'? Speak up. Okay, Somdev will tell you. 'G' along with an 'R' followed by then comes 'D' and a 'U' and another 'A' and then comes 'TE'. 'GRADUATE!' Great. I thought you're asking me to spell it in English. Don't think too much. Here's what you will do. Add four more names in your guest list. When your father-in-law gives you the money... you can quietly hand it over to me. Otherwise, I'll make you rot behind bars for demanding dowry. And once in there... you won't need to make an effort to lose weight. Get it? I do. Have a good day. All this running for nothing. You should exercise as well. No... I don't need to lose any weight. Her astrological charts show that... she will only bear daughters. Our daughter has already completed her B.Ed. And she has a desire to teach kids even after her marriage. Are you going to decide... what she will do after marriage? That's not what I meant, Mr. Ambernath. This is my eldest daughter-in-law. She is much more educated than your daughter. But she never had any stupid notions like taking up a job. We'll give it a thought and let you know. If your son and our daughter could meet... Enough! Now leave... 'Father may be the only person in this world...' '...who uses an oxygen cylinder for his heart condition.' 'But this oxygen cylinder is more like his strength, and not weakness.' 'Actually my brother Alok fell in love.' 'He wanted to marry Sakshi and make her my Sister-in-law.' 'But father had already fixed his wedding with Urmila.' 'Brother rebelled against it, and when father slapped him...' '...he decided to leave home.' 'Brother was almost out of the door...' '...when father clenched his heart and fell on the sofa.' 'Brother's courage was shattered...' '...and finally had to marry Urmila instead of Sakshi.' 'An Indian father has the weakest heart in the world.' 'The Lord created him equipped with a 'heart-attack button'. 'As soon as things start to get out of control...' '...he presses the button and brings the situation in control'. 'Now brother keeps himself busy with work.' They showroom we got from his father-in-law...' '...has already expanded threefold in just two years.' 'He also looks after father's money-lending business.' 'At night he sits on the terrace alone and has a few drinks...' '...and sometimes even falls asleep there.' 'It's been a while since I saw brother smile.' 'I just pray to the Lord...' '...that my story doesn't end like this.' Hello! Welcome! We extend our welcome to Mr. Diwedi and his son Prakash... and to all of the guests present here, on behalf of Quota International Band. The buffet has been laid out. Oh, God! The guests haven't even started yet... and you two are already eating. This is the limit! Why? Are these guests our 'Gods'? Do we need to offer them food before we eat ourselves? Okay, listen... - Mom, buffet means everyone helps themselves. I know what a buffet means. Now go... Go and invite the guests. The food is still hot. Tell them to start helping themselves. Come on. Do we have to feed them too or can they eat on their own? Come on. I must admit, the arrangements are simply amazing. All my guests are really happy. What can I say? I had to do it. After all... it's my only daughter's wedding. Here you go. There was no need for this. We're not greedy for money. Mr. Tiwari. There's something I would like to say.. Hello! Look... we're in an urgent meeting. Please come back later. I can clearly see what's so urgent.. Madam. Please spare us the speech on 'women empowerment'. We know what's wrong and right. Out! Shut up! And don't interfere. I don't want to talk to you. I didn't come here to stop you. I only came hereto invite you for dinner. And anyway, I already gave up on trying to reform this country long ago. You see... all your guests are loitering around. So I request you to continue your business deal in the room. Yeah! See... that's all I wanted to say. Do you like pudding? No. Do try, it's really delicious. I guarantee you will love it. Good bye. Come. She looks like a bachelor. I am only taking a picture. I will find her a groom. You just watch. Fine, go. Attention friends... No, Mr. Prakash will tell us about his experience... He has nothing to say, allow me... just a second. Hello. My name's Badri. Prakash's best friend! First and foremost, we're grateful for the hospitality, you have shown us. The pudding was simply delicious today... so I figured we must show them a thing or two. Hit it. Come. When my eyes When my eyes met yours This made the lover surrender When my eyes met yours This made the lover surrender When you shyly peeked out of the window This made the lover surrender Listen O girl! Being in your love I never knew when June became December When you scolded me in English This made the lover surrender When you slapped my cheeks with love This made the lover surrender When my eyes met yours My looks are awesome, my style is beautiful I know you very well, you’re a bloody fool My looks are awesome, my style is beautiful I know you very well, you’re a bloody fool I know you very well, you’re a bloody fool It’s the wedding season, not an April Fool’s day How can I say that I accept you? When I covered my face innocently This made the lover surrender When my eyes When your eyes met mine Then the lover surrendered O blessed one! Please understand that fighting is useless Can you not see my love, is there dust in your eyes? Can you not see my love, is there dust in your eyes? It was Shah Jahan's mistake to build the Taj Mahal He had money, whereas I just have a flower in my hands When you disconnected my call in anger This made the lover surrender When my eyes , O mister! When my eyes met your eyes This made the lover surrender Yes he surrendered, yes he surrendered, yes he surrendered Uncle, this cylinder... Yeah, I have a bit of... What do you call your company? It's a unique name. Our work is unique too. I saw both your daughters at Prakash's wedding. Beautiful. If you could give me their bio-data and birth-chart... I will find suitable grooms for them immediately. Both of them? Of course, aunt. I know some great boys from good families. By the way, I am a bachelor too. You're doing a great job, son. We're already under a lot of pressure to get them married. Have faith in God, aunt. Both of them will get married on the same day. I assure you. Please have this. You're quite the sly guy. Both the sisters have some amazing features. Why did you climb on the bed? Get off. I am so happy- By the way, whom are you focusing on? I was thinking about the younger one, but she's a rebel. I want peace. So you can keep the younger one. Thank you very much, sir. The elder one is Kritika and the younger one is Vaidehi. Surname Trivedi. Show me. Vaidehi Trivedi. What a nice name. Badri... are you in love? You must be crazy. My time to fall in love is over. If father fixes my marriage with someone else... then I'll have to spend the rest of my life looking at her picture. And who needs two love-lost Romeos in one house? My brother is enough. I am looking to get married. Now do one thing... take this bio-data to my father. Have you lost your mind? I am not going to stick my head into the lion's den. Then who will? Speak up. Mr. Romeo... Excellent idea! How are you, brother? This is the first time you've ever checked in on me. Must be something very important. No... I thought I'd have a drink with you today. Soda or water? Neat. Neat? I see... By the way, she was really beautiful. Who? The same girl you were dancing with at the function. Her name is Vaidehi Trivedi. You're in a hurry. Brother, do you miss Sakshi? Are you trying to fix your marriage or destroy mine. I seriously want to know, I'm not joking. Tell me. I used to for a couple of months in the beginning. But Urmila's an amazing girl too. Yes... Brother, please speak to father about my marriage. I can't talk to him. Just say it... He'll get another heart-attack... and maybe this time he won't make it. We will all be free from him. Did you talk to Vaidehi? What do I talk to her about? Does she want to marry you? That doesn't matter. Her parents do. And they are under a lot of pressure. And anyway, they won't find anyone better than me in UP. Look, take my advice. Talk to her once. Vaidehi didn't look like the obedient type to me. And we'll involve father at the final stage. Badri, slow down. There's no time to slow down. I've must get to Kota... and you don't drink too much. Vaidehi, you tell us. 'Claustrophobia.' Anxiety caused by being confined in a closed space. Didn't she recognize me? How could she when you're wearing those glasses? How can she not recognize me? We danced together, don't you remember? Who was dancing with you? I was just dancing. Just dancing! By the way, do you teach English here? I am a student, not a teacher. That's nice... everyone should learn English. If the mother knows English... the children automatically learn English. By the way, I own a really big car showroom in Jhansi. That oar Somdev's driving is from our showroom. My brother looks after it. My father... My father is a well-known money-lender. Brother lends money on interest... and I recover it. Our family is very respected in Jhansi, you can ask anyone. Why are you telling me all this? You must know. Why? Why? If anyone asks what does your husband do... what are you going to say? Husband? Why are you laughing? Have you lost your mind? What is so funny? Whoever told you that I am looking for a husband? No one has to tell me... it's obvious. If you don't get married now, what else will you do? Don't be shy, tell me? You can drop this stupid idea for good. I am not interested in marrying you. Let's go. 'It's hard to believe that she's annoyed by me.' 'I am sure there's a different reason for it.' 'The reason behind Vaidehi's annoyance was her father Mr. Trivedi...' '...and the reason behind Mr. Trivedi's weak heart...' '...was his younger daughter's love story.' 'Vaidehi and Sagar met in college and fell in love.' 'They had all the intentions of getting married...' '...but also hoped to start a saloon business together.' The place is really nice but the rate's too high. Oh, sir... it's a road-facing shop. The owner wants 2 million in cash and 1.5 million in cheque... he won't budge from his demands. I can borrow 1.5 million... but I only have 600,000-700,000 in cash. 'Asking a middle-class Father for his provident fund...' '...is as good as asking for his kidney.' It took me 25 years to save 2.5 million. I've to think about your marriage. Start thinking about getting married... and forget these stupid dreams of starting a business. There's no way you can get us both married in 25. We hope to profit around 600,000 per year from the saloon! You don't have to worry about my marriage, father. Sagar's parents are not hungry for dowry. We get married in court. Think about the future. If the business does well... you can expect a life of leisure. Otherwise, you'll still be sitting in patched up clothes. 'Well... everyone likes to lead a life of comfort.' 'Mr. Trivedi did regret dipping into his savings...' '...but he swallowed his regret with his glass of rum...' '...and lent Vaidehi rupees 1.2 million.' 'Sagar and Vaidehi handed over their cash to the broker...' '...and started dreaming about their beautiful future.' 'But the broker and Sagar had conspired together.' 'And he disappeared with the cash.' 'Trivedi sir pushed his button and lay down.' - What happened? 'Followed with some cuss words.' Papa... Did you start your business? You know what, why don't you sell my kidney as well... and start a new business? Or better yet sell all my organs. In fact, sell my heart while it's still working. Papa, it's not my fault that he was a crook. I only wanted to start this business for everyone's benefit. How many times have I tried to tell you... people always try to cheat girls. I cannot blame you since I am the unlucky one. So? She left you stranded in the parking? She must be feeling shy because I spoke to her directly. Stop lying- She clearly rejected you on your face. You don't know what she said. You weren't there with me. Badri, I might not read books but I know how to read your expressions well. It's a good thing, you know. Now just forget about her and move on. How can I just move on? You have it really good, brother. Sister-in-law cooks delicious meals for you every day. Help me out too. Even I want my wife to come to the showroom every day. Serve me lunch. I see.. Of course. But even I bring meals for you every day. Here you go. Sister in-law. It's not just food he's looking for, Sister-in-law. It's time for him to chew betel-leaf. One with special ingredients. Why don't you talk to mom? There's no point in talking to mom. Brother, talk to father. Are you crazy? If father does send a proposal... and Vaidehi refuses then father will hang us all. I will handle everything, just talk to him. I don't want to listen to you. Brother.. Listen... If he's insisting so much, why don't you try talking to him once? Fine, I'll talk to him. Wow, brother, you've been listening to Urmila these days. Because she is smart and not stupid like you. She is not stupid like you. She is not stupid. When are you going to talk to him'? Somdev's brought this proposal? Yes, mom. He's started a matrimonial company. Remember, what starts with a snap... often ends in a snap too. I told you... Let's meet her once, she is beautiful. Even the Taj Mahal is beautiful. But keeping its beauty intact is expensive. Which the government pays for. Can Mr. Trivedi meet our expectations? I already had a word with the family. They will arrange for everything. Badri, do you want to see her picture? Father, I am such an amateur in these things. You can finalize all of it. I don't want to see any picture. You're such a lousy actor. I can clearly see the lust on your face. Stop it. They own a showroom, money-lenders by profession... and pretty popular in Jhansi. What more do you ask for? Can't we discuss anything else other than marriage? Of course, we can... How much profit is your saloon making these days? Sarcasm won't change our decision, papa. It's a really nice family. How do you know? I don't want to get married. And why don't you think about Kritika, she's elder to me. You didn't think about her... when you squandered away all the money. Are you okay? No, I am not okay. I've been trying really hard... to get this burden off my chest. But it's in no mood to budge an inch. Don't get angry, papa... you will only ruin your health. You better explain to them, Kritika. We can take decisions for our own life. What will you do with that card? Send a reply for their marriage proposal. Open the video quickly. It's not as easy as opening my drawstring. It will take time. I already told you once I don't want to get married. Don't you get it? Sending a marriage proposal to my family was a cheap trick. Next time I will file a complaint at the police station. And you'll be arrested for molestation charges. Get that into your thick head and don't forget. What's 'molestation'? Mo... Badri! This is the third time in two days... I've been driving up and down between Kota and Jhansi. Do you have any idea that the oil-wells around the world are drying up? Show some mercy. Then stop rubbing so much oil on your hair... and it won't dry so soon. That's not oil, it's a styling gel. Hello, Kritika. I will set your dreams ablaze. Focus on my girl. I can clearly understand all this drama you're up to. What did I do? knew your intention wasn't good... right from the wedding function. If my intentions weren't good, I would've made you my girlfriend... and not proposed to marry you. Girlfriend? Did you ever have a girlfriend? I didn't want one in the first place. Thank God you didn't, because you could've never had one. Right, sister? Let's stop discussing about girlfriend-boyfriend... and talk about marriage instead. I don't want to get married? Do I have to tattoo that on my arm for you to understand? Is he bothering you? Does it look like I am bothering her? Don't try to be a hero. Look... Listen. Yes. I don't want to get married, okay? Not with you, or any other boy or girl. Okay? What do you want to do? I only want to see Kritika get married. And then I will leave Kota forever. Where? The Himalayas. There's a small cottage up there, where I will renounce this world. Ms. Vaidehi. Yes. I know all about what that boy did with you. I can understand that you're in shock. But I am stilling willing to marry you. You're shameless. My elder sister is still unmarried... and you're dreaming about the younger one. I will get her married too. I am ready to marry you. We can all get married at the same venue. I would rather commit suicide than marry you. Hey man, stop bothering her... Sit down or I will punch the daylights out of you. "Bothering..." Look... Yes. Marriage is a bond between two equal. So please spare us. I know, but I have a big heart. You're a middle-class girl, but... I am still willing to marry you. I didn't mean wealth, I was referring to intellect. I have a really sharp mind. Go ahead and test me. I see... What are your qualifications? Meaning? Qualification means only one thing. I've finished high-school. And he's Mr. Bansal's son. That's all the qualification one needs in Jhansi. Is he the candidate or are you? Stop interfering. Ask... Kota is famous for IIT classes. What does 'IIT' stands for? IIT? 'Indian Institute of Technology.' Don't ask me questions... about things that are not related to me. Fine, you own a car showroom, don't you? What is the full form of ABS system? Stop looking at me. You're the candidate here. Anti-Lock Braking system. My brother looks after that job. You're a money-lender, aren't you? How does one calculate 'Simple Interest' and 'Compound Interest'? Look here, I've already cleared high-school. And even have the certificate for it. I don't need to prove anything to you. What will you do if your father throws you out? Why will my father throw me out? What if he does? You're not making any sense. I am his son after all, why will he throw me out? Come here. If you get me pregnant before our wedding... won't he throw you out? Don't you see she's bothering me now! Badri. You're glued to your seat. Huh! Badri, I guess the stars are not in your favor today. Let's go. We'll talk to her tomorrow. Come on. You've mentally disturbed today, something's wrong with her. I will come back tomorrow. You can't graduate in a single day. I am a really nice guy, and I will take good care of you. Okay-okay... let it go. Did you hear how she was talking to me? Let's go. Just a minute, aunt. Bye. Are you crying, Badri? I feel like crying, what to do? Come here... don't cry. She's crazy, forget it. Did you hear how she talked to me? You're a 'Bansal'. Bansal's don't cry, they make others cry. Forget her. Where did you park your bike? Come outside, we need to talk. Forget about the money we lost. But finally something good is happening. Don't ruin it with your stubbornness. Once you get married, Kritika will too. Papa, I want her to get married. We've been circulating your bio-data for three years now. Even Kritika has rejected some pretty good proposals... because of her stubbornness. Good proposals stop coming with age. They are not the right guys, papa. Dear, even you can't distinguish between right and wrong. I will be retiring after two years. And I want to see you two get married before that. I've spoken with my bosses. They will lend me the money against my house. Without any interest. And I will repay the debt somehow. Papa, as soon as I get a job... we'll repay all your debts. I don't want your money, dear. Just stop looking for a job. And get married. Let Kritika get married too. Just do me this one favor. Wow... Sweets! Congratulations, Priest. Someone had a daughter? Me. Still trying, huh! What number is this? Four. Better stop now... Otherwise, there will hardly be any difference... between daughter and granddaughter. So, brother, you didn't tell me how was the meeting? It was amazing. She was begging me to marry her. But I said we're not in a hurry. I see... You said you're not in a hurry. You see, brother, marriages are a tricky business. It's important to be a little evasive. Somdev, those people from Kota haven't shown up yet. Mr. Trivedi has a heart problem as well. He's asked for a week's time. Ask them to hurry up, he's been asking. Yes... You two better stop joking. If father loses his temper... he will banish you two from Kota permanently. Hello. Can we meet today evening? Why? I wanted to talk to you... in private. I'll leave now... it'll take me four hours to get there. Fine, see you then. Bye. Okay, I'm hanging up then. Your Sister-in-law. Brother, I think the marriage is fixed. What are you doing? Let's go. Okay, smile. Hey... get lost... come on. Badri. I am really impressed by the people of Kota. They've built another Taj Mahal here. There are seven wonders of the world right here... and you only know about the Taj Mahal? Did you call me here to teach me Geography? You're looking really smart today. You should marry Kritika. Have you lost it? She's much better looking and qualified than me. And she's a Trivedi as well. If tomorrow you call your dog 'Sweety Trivedi'... will I have to marry her too? I want to marry you. I don't want to get married, Badri... please try and understand. I am requesting you as a friend. Please, it will be a big burden off my father's chest. There are other ways to lighten his burden. Circulate her bio-data in UP and Rajasthan... and she will immediately get married. It's not that easy, Badri. Kritika has already rejected 30 proposals. Then tell your sister... to stop trying to make a 'world record' for most number of rejections. Marry her... Vaidehi... Ms. Vaidehi. Yes. Don't be upset. I won't marry her, but... I will find a husband for her. Promise? Promise! Don't expect anything more, Badri. Hope is what drives this world. Listen. Yes. You're actually looking smart today. I look smart every day... but you noticed it today. What's this board for? I'll tell you. Kritika, now you describe the kind of guy you're looking for. Somdev will draw him on this board... and we'll find a similar looking guy for you. I am going to draw my picture... you can say anything you like. Shut up... Kritika, start. Go on... My husband will be very cultured. How does one draw 'cultured'? Kritika, forget cultured... tell us about his features. I see... Handsome face with a fair complexion. Curly hair. Brown eyes. Strong shoulders... and a slim waist. Yeah... And he will come for me riding on a horse. Draw it. You want a husband like Hrithik Roshan? Exactly like him. Do you have anyone in mind? I look like Hrithik from a distance. From a mile away. What is all this? We're looking for my husband, not the next Roadie. Don't worry, we've made all the arrangements. By tonight you will find your husband. I've two garment showrooms in Gwalior. Two... It's a 'yes' from us. Absolutely 'no'. Why? He's a nice guy. What nice? She will spend the rest of her life cleaning his betel-leaf stains. Thank you. I am from Lucknow. Still looking for a job. First, find a job and then come back. My son lives in Dubai. He also works in Dubai. Even my sister will work in Dubai, do you agree? Of course, I do. I don't like him. Why? The boy doesn't say a word. His father does all the talking. He will learn slowly. Don't try to force my sister. I told you, you'll marry me only. You see, it's like this.. Uncle... Dubai. "Made me a lover... made me a lover..." "You made me a lover." "Made me a lover..." Stop-stop-stop... why are you singing? I am auditioning. Isn't this India's Got Talent? Do I look like Karan Johar to you? Huh? Get lost. Oh my, Jadoo. Hrithik. Kritika, your dreams have come true. This is not my dream. Just let him dance first Mister, dance for us. Hey, mister, stop. Stop.. That's enough. Someone take his batteries out. What was he doing? I warned you... Finding a husband for her is not easy. Then why don't you talk to your sister? Everyone has to compromise in life. How can I ask her to compromise... when I don't believe in compromising? Don't worry, I am fasting on Monday. The Lord will definitely be pleased. You are keeping a fast? Because there's a shortage of good men in the country. What about you... the leader of all good men? I am... but I cannot marry everyone. There's something called chivalry. Nonsense... You're miles away from any kind of chivalry. Why? Have I ever said anything vulgar to you? Have I ever held your hand? Or ever... pulled you like this. What's this? Sorry, I got carried away in emotions. Control your emotions. Think about Kritika. I am out of my wits thinking about her. Why don't you look for some NRI? Excuse me, I am not a traitor. My own brothers are still bachelors. You're quite a patriot. Yes... I am. Found it! What'? Indian NRI. A warm welcome to everyone from Bhushan Patnaik. We're devout of the Goddess. You've all come here seeking her refuge. And she's a Benevolent Goddess! One who alleviates all our sufferings. So let's all Focus on Goddess... And She will shower her grace on you. So repeat after me... Glory to.. The Benevolent One! Is that your local NRI? He's no NRI! He's one of my clients... from Jhansi. Shut up. The entire family is from Jhansi, but... they spend half the year around the world arranging religious programs. I'll go talk to him about the proposal. Shall I? Go. Promise? Yes. I'll go. Go. Go on! Come on. I am not going. Come on! Stay back... There is no need to approach the stage... The Goddess will bless everyone. Bhushan, are you married? I'm still a bachelor. But with the grace of Goddess... maybe I will find a life-partner soon. Because the Goddess has a big heart. Sing with me, Glory to the Benevolent One! Glory to Her! Bhushan, I need to speak with you. Let's talk after the program. We must talk right now. You see, father takes all the bookings for the programs. Well, actually I want to book you... for marriage. Marriage? Bhushan's marriage. Why isn't anyone saying something? She will definitely reject him. Hey, Romeo... Don't jinx this. I will kill you! Why are you so shy? No reason... I just... Can I say something? Of course. I didn't like you at all at first. But now I really like your calm nature. Can I say something too? I always knew that the fruits of devotion are sweet. But I didn't know it would be so beautiful as well. Seems like everything is going well. Looks promising. I am leaving, I can't see this. What are you doing? Do you like to sing? Yes. During school and college... I took part in many singing competitions. Good. You can also sing with us in our programs. We've been looking for a female singer for a while. But I guess we won't need one now. Why don't you sing something? You are... Listen... I really like you. But we'll keep looking for a singer. Well... we conduct religious programs all over the world. Canada, America, Britain... and so we have modern thoughts as well. That's a good thing. In fact, we would want your daughter... to work even after her marriage. And not just sit idle at home. That's even better. The children are getting along just fine. So... why don't we grownups discuss things too? Yes... of course. So... how should we go about this? You tell us. His son looks like a horse... what are they demanding 2.5 million for? Dear, that's the standard rate these days. I'll call the police right now! They will learn a lesson when they rot behind bars. The police won't do anything. Calm down. Stop supporting them. Don't worry, I will make some arrangement. How? By selling this house or mortgaging it? You're a heart patient. If something happens to you... will you live out on the streets? What are you saying? Shut up! It's the truth! They call themselves devotees... but feel no shame in asking for dowry.. Vaidehi. Papa... I will speak with them. Don't worry. I will fix everything. Uncle, your demand was too high. Be reasonable. I see... so you're here to bargain with me. My boy's not on sale... There's a long list of proposals for him. Bhushan, talk to your father. You like Kritika, don't you? Hey... don't try to provoke him! We're not provoking him, just talking. Are you her uncle... that you're bargaining with me? Bhushan, talk to your father while there's still time! Otherwise, Kritika will marry someone else. He will marry her. Yeah.. I will... what will you do? Nothing.. Just sit there? Listen to me... Talk to me... Say something. Throw these guys out. Be reasonable, father! I've been asking you to reduce it for a while... How dare you back talk to your father? I will remain a bachelor forever because of your greed. You even rejected Verma's daughter. I will die a bachelor. Shut up! Even Sharma's daughter left. Enough of this game. Don't try to explain these things to me. Tomorrow when your father puts forth his demands... then how will you stop him? Will he be reasonable? I can adjust a little... not anymore. Come on... now get out. What's wrong? You look stressed. I am under pressure for this dowry. I've to arrange for both the daughters. You look more like their father. Now I know why India has so many heart patients. If this goes on... then soon I'll need father's oxygen cylinder. Is Mr. Trivedi unable to arrange for the money? Alok, why don't you suggest something? Father won't agree to this alliance without a dowry. And every time Vaidehi hears about dowry she gets violent. What can I say? I can't think of anything. Badri, Mr. Trivedi has arranged for half the amount, hasn't he? Then why don't you arrange for the rest? Father or Mr. Patnaik will never know. You can tell him that Mr. Trivedi has arranged for the entire amount. But how can I arrange for such a big amount? We can prematurely break one of the showroom's FDs. But the transaction will show in the statement. Father will ask about it. You can say that someone wanted to borrow a large amount of cash. And since you didn't have cash in hand... you had to take it from the showroom's account. And anyway, we've multiple shares... mutual fund investments as well. And soon it will be time for cash recovery too. We can show multiple entries in the book and adjust some of it. Wow, Urmila. You learned a thing or two about this business... spending time with Alok. She didn't learn from me, I learned from her. What? I... I topped my college in Banking and Accounts. Before the wedding... I even got offers from three banks. One from even Singapore. But father didn't agree. She has a big contribution... in the expansion of both our businesses. Where to invest, on what rate of interest... she has pretty good knowledge about it all. I see... So this is what you two actually do during those lunch hours. Does father know? Urmila, you must be really angry... with father, with us? Yes, I was, in the beginning. But your brother is too sweet. So I only feel love for him. So do I. Vaidehi is so fortunate. Her husband is a diamond. He's paying for his own dowry. I will call her right now and tell her.. No, brother... not now. It won't be right. Okay. By the way how do you calculate 'Simple Interest'? What? Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Badri? Simple Interest = PRT/100 Great. And Compound Interest? It's a bit complicated. But I will tell you soon. Yes. If only you two had met earlier... he would've graduated college. I see... I have a unique offer of a good news and a proposal. What's the offer? The good news is that Mr. Patnaik has accepted. And proposal? My father's accepted too. So if you say yes... there will be two weddings instead of one! Just say yes... and make my prediction come true. Give it a thought. And then tell me. May I leave? Okay. Really? Fine, I am going. Let's go now! Kritika. Why are you getting married? Because my happiness is on the ground and not in the skies. Badri is really nice. But... our worlds are completely apart. I want something else in life. Even I wanted Hrithik Roshan... but you don't get one in reality. So you're compromising? No! I am accepting my reality. You can't trust the future. You can't trust anyone actually. Badri is not Sagar, Vaidehi. He's helping all of us without any reason. Should I forget my dreams of flying? Dream about being happy. Then it won't matter whether you're on the ground or in the air. So... there is no difference between Bhushan and Hrithik Roshan. Look here, I am not going to lie... and my would-be husband cannot tolerate the truth. So just go to sleep. Alok and Badri have together expanded my business. In just two years. You're really very fortunate. Two sons and both so talented. The color of your cylinder is really nice. Well, Alka insisted that I get it polished before coming here. Do you have breathing problems? No, my breathing is fine. But I have a very weak heart. So I don't take a risk and always carry this with me. You should. When we heard the name of his company... we thought it will close down pretty soon. But I can't believe... what a pretty girl he found for my Badri. I will advertise his company all over Kota. At the first meet, Somdev said... that both your daughters will get married on the same day. And look... it's come true. Yes. I had no clue that my tongue was so cursed. Otherwise, I would've Cut it out a long time ago. Both the fathers have become very good friends. They are bonding well over oxygen cylinders and heart-attack. Stop laughing, mom... they are calling everyone downstairs. Yes, of course... Let's go. Let's go. Someday you will realize, Vaidehi... that I am the best choice. Vaidehi. Yes. Thank you for marrying me. Thank you for keeping your promise. Listen, Oh my beloved Do you have the slightest idea Listen, Oh my beloved Do you have the slightest idea, of the way your breath travels ? I could live there, all my life... I could live there, all my life... As beautiful as these meetings are More lovely are your words When I lose myself in your words I wish I could never come back to my senses again In your arms, I could spend my whole life Listen, Oh my beloved Do you have the slightest idea Oh cruel one! In your love, I have become crazy… I was just standing, Lost in some thoughts How I am leading this life like a madman… And you came quietly, You entered my heart And so begun this love story I learnt to smile from you Only you, who my heart is attached to You are the faith of my life, I wish I could never come back to my senses again In your arms, I could spend my whole life Yes, I didn't know, That I would consider you as my God That I would come to your street, so much , all the time Listen, Oh my beloved Do you have the slightest idea, of the way your breath travels ? I could live there, all my life... I could live there, all my life... Oh cruel one! In your love, I have become crazy… Looking nice. Carefully. Let me help. Alok... Go ahead Bhushan. Exchange the garlands. Or else Badri will elope with your bride. Alok, what happened? What happened? Vaidehi Trivedi, why do you want to be an air-hostess? For the past two years I've had just one dream... Air-hostess... - The job of a cabin crew is not some dream. It's a very serious job. Young girls think they will get to travel all over the world as an air-hostess. But it's hard work. Sir, I am from Kota. There's a garden... called the 'Seven Wonder's Park'. I've already seen the Seven wonders of the world. My dream is not to see the world. It's to build a future for myself. And I am ready to work hard to achieve that Hello. Hello... How are you? Vaidehi! Vaidehi, where are you? You're calling after so long... Who runs away like that? Morn, I am in Mumbai. Mumbai? What are you doing there? And are you okay? Yes, mom. I am absolutely fine. I was taking training at the Frankfinn Academy... for a job. How... How are you? How is papa? He's very angry with you. Just come back now. Come on. Please listen, mom. I got a job as a air-hostess. Oh... So you ran away for a job? No, mom. I didn't just run away to get a job. Please try to understand, mom. Understand what? Kritika's wedding almost got canceled that day, but... And poor Badri... Sorry. Will papa talk to me? I want to tell him about my job. Please give him the phone. I'll have to check if he's up... I'll ask. Hold on. Listen... it's Vaidehi's calling from Mumbai. She wants to talk to you... Just talk to her... lam still telling you to... just come back. Yes, mom. Alright. I have to go now. Take care. Okay. Hurry up... haven't you eaten? Badri. What brings you here? Do you want to eat something? The Wedding's over, isn't it? Yes. When are going to pay up? I will pay tomorrow.. If you can pay tomorrow, Then why not today? Stay back, or else I will throw you out of the city. When no one was willing to lend money to your father... my family trusted you, didn't we? Yes. And that's how you started this restaurant. Yes, but... This fritter you're offering me is brought from our money. Forgive me! Forgive me! When you promised to pay the money, then why haven't you? It's wrong to trust anyone these days! Badri! Badri! Badri, what are you doing? Have you lost your mind? The repair work cost extra... so I couldn't pay back the money on time. But I will definitely pay tomorrow. Fine. Somdev, take him away. Let's go. Come... Brother. I will definitely pay tomorrow. Since Vaidehi ran away my business has gone to the dogs. I fixed Kritika's wedding as well. But no one remembers that. I can't forget her, Somdev. Your planets were definitely in a conflict... when she entered your life. But why did she run away? She could've refused if she didn't want to marry me. Why humiliate me in front of the entire city? Badri, it's impossible to understand females. That's why elders always advice against falling in love. Get married when you grow up... have few kids and then life's set. I even thought of names for the children. Vishnu... Sarthak... Prerna... Rukmani. Why did you stop? One more and you could've had your own small army! What the hell? Stop laughing at my life! Badri... Father's calling you. they've found Vaidehi. Trivedi called... he was apologizing. That girl is in Mumbai. It doesn't make any difference to me... whether she is in Mumbai or she's dead. She is dead for me. Not just for you... she will have to die for everyone. She likes to run away, doesn't she? I'll hang her body in the street, so that... it's a lesson for everyone that women shouldn't forget their limits. Take the car... go to Mumbai. Find her... And bring her here. Why are you looking at Alok? I am talking to you. Don't you understand what I'm saying? Go and get her! All our friends and family are still talking about it. She destroyed your reputation. And you're still thinking. Are you up for it, Badri... or should I send someone else.. - I will go! I will go. There is no need to send anyone else. Bravo. Badri, don't be crazy. You don't have to go anywhere. I am going. You don't have to do this, brother. You're not like this at all. And what about her? Was what she did right? Badri... I don't know what kind of a man I am. But I know I have to go. Come, Somdev. Vaidehi Trivedi trained here, right? Yes. But who are you? We're from Kota... her relatives. I see... We heard she got a job. Yes... So we brought sweets for her. But, sir, she went abroad for training. What? Yes, sir. She's gone abroad. She did tell us, but we forgot all about it. Where did she go? She's got a job at silk air. These exits are the two doors at the front... and two at the rear. And two at each side of the over wing-windows. In-case of decompression... oxygen masks will automatically drop from the compartment above. Please read-it carefully before the takeoff. Good job. Enjoy your meal Welcome to Silk-Air. I'll see you in a bit. Okay. Bye. Bye. Enjoy. Yeah. You like to run, don't you. Come on then PT Usha, let's run. Badri! Badri! Badri! Badri... Badri, what are you doing? Somdev! Somdev! Badri! Badri! Badri, please let me out. What you're doing is not right, Badri. You won't get away with this. If the police catch you, they will throw you behind bars. Please... Listen to me, Badri... please! Don't try to threaten me. I am not afraid of the law. I will kill you right here... and I don't even care if they hang me for it. Why did you do it? I did everything I could for you. And you deceived me.. I never mistreated or misbehaved with you. I literally went out on a hand and limb for you and your family. And you left me. I was standing there on the alter... holding the garland. I was dreaming of my future with you. And you.. Sorry. What sorry? What sorry? If you didn't want to marry me, you could've said so. Badri, I tried telling you so many times... but you weren't prepared to listen.. You could've said it again, Vaidehi. Did I force you? You were really cunning. Taking advantage of me to get your sister married. And disappeared in thin air. Badri, you were helping me for your own intentions... it wasn't some charity.. I was. But I was doing a good thing. I didn't hurt anyone. What good did you do by lying? What did I lie about? Badri, I know. You arranged for that money. Who told you? No one has to tell me... because I know what kind of people they... I don't care what they think! But it was a blessing for you, wasn't it? Where ever the money came from... how does it make a difference to you? It does make a difference, Badri! Why are they putting a price on me? Did I put a price on you? But.. I put a price on you, Vaidehi? But you didn't stop your father either. Did you? So you're punishing me for his mistakes. Badri... I didn't run away because of you. I ran away for myself. And... I felt suffocated there. I don't know how to help with your suffocation now. My father sent me to bring you back! He said he will kill you publicly.. Show everyone the consequences of running away. Then why did you stop? Let's go to Jhansi. That's exactly what I wanted to do. But I love you too much... it weakens me. I am Sgt. Laxmi Shankar. I've been called to communicate with you in Hindi. When Sgt. Zhangvi saw you, he was trying to strangle you. Is that correct? No, ma'am. So he wasn't trying to strangle you? No, ma'am. So then was he giving you a massage? We don't want to discuss our personal matters. If you prefer keeping your personal life behind closed doors... then stop taking massages in the open at night. Like I said, ma'am, it was a misunderstanding. It won't happen again. What are you staring at? The police station is really nice. Jails are a lot nicer. Would you like to see? It's your first warning. Next time we'll deport you... or put you behind bars. Get it. Mr. Badri, out here in Singapore... we're not used to staying up late at nights. So my suggestion is that... you two stay away from each other. I don't want to go anywhere near her! If you won’t be there in front of my eyes tomorrow I hope I don't die without seeing you... How should I forget you? You won’t get persuaded, how can I persuade you? Tell me Even upon trying, these tears are not stopping They want to stay with you always Even upon trying, these tears are not stopping The place where the lines of fate of two hands meet If someone knows, tell me Where that place is What sort of helplessness is this in love? Even after meeting the heartbeats, the heart is lonely How do I make the distance less ? You won’t get persuaded, how can I persuade you? Tell me Even upon trying, these tears are not stopping They want to stay with you always Even upon trying, these tears are not stopping Lein's calling you. Why? Hello. All fine in Singapore? Yeah. I hope you didn't tell father. Not yet, I haven't. But hurry up, he will find out soon. I've some news for you. Yes. Your Sister-in-law is pregnant. That's great news. Yeah... And father's looking for a bride for you. He's saying that he'll get you married as soon as you return. So hurry up. I'll call you back. Vaidehi, very few people get this opportunity that you're getting. So please don't waste it. Encounter with the cops... is not what we encourage. Ma'am, actually a friend of mine is here from India... and he just got into a little bit of trouble, so... I understand. Maybe you should know this. We're actually considering you for a posting in Singapore. And this can be huge for your career. So think about it. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Thank you, ma'am. Alok said... father's trying to find a bride for me. He's doing the right thing. Are you planning to chase her for the rest of your life instead? Don't talk nonsense, Somdev. Nonsense... I am talking nonsense? Yes, you are. Look... be a man. Either teach her a lesson... or let's just go back! Shut up, I'm getting pissed. I can see that. Losing your mind... My back's gone sore from sitting all day in the car. Then get some ointment for it, but shut up. I won't. You gave Jhansi a bad reputation. This is my last warning, shut up. Last warning? Yes, last... What do you want? I said shut up! Shut up! She abandoned you on your wedding. Now she's right in front of you... but you're helpless. You know what? Just keep wasting fuel chasing her. That's all you can do... I told you to shut up! Bickering nonsense like an old hag. See, I hit you now. I... Somdev! Somdev! Where are you going? Vaidehi call.. Passport... Airhostess... Vaidehi... Vaidehi Trivedi, she knows me. I am going inside. Let me through... Just call her. Badri. Vaidehi... Badri, get down. Sir sorry... sorry. He's my friend... my friend. Badri... come. I need to talk to you. My father will get me married to someone else. I want to marry only you... why don't you get it? Shut up. Let's go to Jhansi. I am ready to go back. I earn 150,000 a month here. I was just told that maybe I can get a job in Singapore. I am ready to quit all that, let's go. But first call your father. Tell him that even after marriage... Vaidehi will work wherever she wants. And I support her.. Tell him... Call him! You can't do it. You can't do it, can you? What's wrong, Badri? You can publicly kill me... You're even willing to die in Singapore... but you can't call your own father. Vaidehi makes 150,000 a month. Somdev... Somdev, I am apologizing Somdev! Don't be so angry. Your BP will shoot up. It's my last warning, you will regret it. I am saying sorry, why don't you get it? Hey... I've been trying to apologize... and your just sulking Try to understand. You... I was your best friend. Weren't you ashamed of slapping me? I came all the way to Singapore for you. Do I have to cut my veins to assure you? How many times do I have to say sorry? How long should I apologize. How can I hear your apology under the water? Somdev, you're my only friend... out here. And who else do I have? And who else do I have? You broke my heart, Badri. I will fix it in a snap. Fix it in a snap.. What are you doing? I can't help it. I don't know what to do? I'll explain you. Come on. Why are you laughing? Come on. Come, I will tell you. Badri... Badri, 150,000 rupees man! Make me an air-hostess as well. You won't look good in a skirt. Just try it on me once. Somdev... let's go back to Jhansi. Badri, since we're in Singapore... let's stay another day. We'll go sight-seeing. Eat some noodles. And then go back. You're such a bad friend. Why? My life's ruined... and your focus is on eating noodles instead. Can't help it that I like noodles. Badri... Whatever's happening... Don't let me make you sad. You have a... killer smile. I mean... If you lose that, then... then what. Life's finished. You've been showing off your English in Singapore. English... I am a master of English. I see... Then tell me the spelling of Vaidehi. Right away... Vaidehi... V with A and I... D follow E... and H with I... Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Vaidehi broke my heart! I will fix it, Badri. Careful... where are you going? I am going back to Jhansi. Are you going to walk to Jhansi? Yes... I am going. You'll fall in the water. I am going to Jhansi. Badri, don't go into the water... Vaidehi! Vaidehi! Vaidehi. Sister in-law Sister-in-law Why are you calling her, Sister-in-law? Uncle.. Uncle... Uncle... My Singapore, uncle... Tell me her flat no... and call her. We want to meet her. Quit... people are sleeping Vaidehi. I will call the police. Tell me Vaidehi's flat number. Tell me Vaidehi's flat number. Call her downstairs. Which... which window. Vaidehi. Vaidehi... Badri... Badri... I'm coming, wait. Come. Your Sister in-law is coming. Badri... Badri... Gurmeet. Are you married? Let him go... Let him go first... Why did you do it? Badri... Why? Vaidehi, why... Badri, control yourself. Sagar betrayed you... and you betrayed me. Badri... Scores settled. Let's go to Jhansi... come... come on. Badri, I am right here. Let's go to Jhansi... I am right here. Court procedures will take three days. Until then we'll keep their passports. He's your responsibility now. Thank you, ma'am. Thank Gurmeet. Bail amount is 1500 dollars. Do you have it? Yes. Need some help? No... Come, guys. The water is kept there. Fruits are in the refrigerator. Bathroom's on the right.. I won't stay here. If you want to order food, then the menu cards are right here. I don't need your charity, I won't stay with you. Where else will you go? Prison? You've been given a warning. Please, Badri, stop this drama. You think this is drama? Vaidehi... The taxi has arrived, shall we? Yes... coming. Badri, they let you out on my friend's guarantee. Please... Vaidehi, I know it's your personal matter. But why are you still helping Badri? Because it was all my fault, Kiran. And he is the one who has to endure everything. What else can I do? You do know you can lose your job over this. Lein has already given you a warning. You know when Sagar betrayed me... I thought, how can anyone be so selfish? And now... I've become like him. This job is important for me, but... I cannot leave Badri alone right now. You know he still loves you. I know. But tell me... what does one do with only love? What do you mean? Isn't love important for you? It's very important. But what's more important is respect. And right now he doesn't respect me, neither do I respect him. So what should I do? Hello... Will I have to do everything. You're crazy. I'm just kidding What are you doing? Gurmeet. Who are you? Excuse me, who are you? Don't try to be pretentious How are you related to her? However I maybe, who are you to ask? You want to know... I'll show you who I am Look here.. I love her! You can't come between us. I was the one standing at the alter with the garland in my hand... you have come between us. Badri. I will make you pay for this. She is mine. She is mine. She's mine! Vaidehi is mine! Kiran's mine! Badri! Gurmeet! What are you doing, Badri? You okay? What's going on? He bites, man. Go inside. Wait... Badri... Badri, wait! What's wrong with you, Badri? How long will you go around beating up people? You know... Gurmeet got you two out of jail... on his personal guarantee. He doesn't even know you... in fact, he hardly knows me, but... I thought.. Badri, listen. If there was anyone else in my life... I would've told you. There is no one! Now... let's go home. What's wrong, Badri? Say something. I don't get it! What kind of a man have I turned into? Being aggressive with you... beating up people. This is not who I am. I hate myself like this. I don't want to bother you anymore. As soon as I get my passport... I will go back to Jhansi. Badri" Vaidehi, run! No, I won't go. Vaidehi, I said run. No, I am not going anywhere. Run, Vaidehi. Badri" Vaidehi, run! You think you're tough guy. I'll show you who's tough. You're handsome. stop provoking me or else... Oh man... What a beautiful face. Such nice lips. What are you doing? You like that? Don't touch me. You go to gym? Don't do it... I'm not liking it. Do you work out? No... no... no... What do you have down here... so soft... No-no-no... that hurts... That hurts... don't pinch me. Don't pinch me there. I wonder where they... You okay? Don't touch me. Hey... Badri. Quiet... Somdev. They tore it all up. Badri. I have to go. I've made food for you two. It's in the fridge. So... reheat it whenever you want to eat. And... I even made pudding for you. I'll eat it. I'm going to the market, you also come No. Stop frowning and smile. Or else I'll call those punks again. Come on. Somdev. This one's really tasty. Don't do it... don't... No! Sorry... sorry. Badri, I feel like puking... I'm getting out of here. I feel really... sick... Don't puke here, guys. Welcome back. Dinner's served. All by yourself, or did they help? Yes, we did. I don't touch fish... so I cut the vegetables. Let me know how you like it? Unbelievable. You did a great job. He mixed all the spices, so he's the main cook. Let's eat? I'll take that... Somdev... Eat it. When the rice was cooked, I switched off the gas. I just tempered the lentil, he made it. Who made the lentil? Well, Somdev tempered the lentil... but Badri cooked it. Salad-Salad... anyone for salads? I will take that. Don't cook breakfast for me anymore. I can take care of myself. You already work quite hard. I can't take a risk. What if you burn down my kitchen? I am not that stupid. I can even operate the microwave now. Wow! You're such a genius. Yeah, I am. So Mr. Microwave, can you please pass me the sugar. Just a minute. Yes, Badri, is everything alright? How do I switch on your microwave? Press the 'start' button. Press the 'start' button. There are so many buttons, which one do I press? The black one on the bottom right. Black one on the bottom right, it's also written there. It's in Chinese and English. It's on.. It's on, Badri. It's on. Actually, I have a different brand back home. Yes, of course... Stop lying... I know it's your first time using a microwave. Now hang up, bye- Look at it moving round and round.. - Just get the food. Sorry... She's here. "All portable electronic devices must be kept in flight-safe mode." "All... Come in. I hope I didn't disturb you. Are you studying? Let me see. I've been observing that you study really hard. But do you understand any of it? I mean, when children study... In fact, when I used to study my brother would test me. So... are how much of this you remember. Do you want me to test you? You are going test me? I just recently in In a plane, and... saw everything they did... you know, when the plane loses its mental balance... That's not mental balance.. Whatever it is? When that happens.. Yes, I know, I know... Show me... In case of decompression oxygen masks will automatically drop... from the compartments above. Pull the mask down sharply to activate the flow of oxygen. How was it? The other day you brought a gift for me, so... Take a look. It's a 'Kamino'! What? China's... Kamino... It's a really nice dress, worn by those people. Kimono. What its called. Wear it. Wow... it's got a seatbelt, this goes here and this one here... Double up. I got shoes for you, and you got me this. You didn't like it'? Of course I did... I meant... I only got you a pair of shoes, and you got this for me! I knew you would like it. Very nice. It's so nice. Aunty...? Aunty, you have been drying a lot of clothes? When will it be my turn? I want to dry my clothes as well.? I'm not from your town, I cant understand what you are saying. Badri, what are you doing Everyone's waiting outside. I want to dry my clothes too... but she's got a whole pile of clothes.. I don't understand... I no Who wears so many clothes? Badri...? No-no-no... You can dry your clothes at night. Did she abused me? Thank you, ma'am. We're sorry. I am leaving. It's better system in Jhansi. Just hang your clothes to dry outside in the sun. Bye, aunty. Yes, brother. It's me. Yes, father. You went to Singapore and didn't tell me? I was going to tell you, but.. You don't even call. Did you find that girl? No... That's enough... come back. Yes... I am coming back... really soon. Badri, who is it? Badri... Badri. Where is he? We're getting late. He's been in the bathroom for over 3O minutes. Badri... I'm looking like a clown, right? Yes. You're looking really cute. Let's go. Silk Air welcomes the families of all cabin crew. Now we want you to observe the door evacuation drill. Brace... Bend down! Head down! Stay down! Stay down! Open seat belt! Open seat belt! Move... come this way, come this way. Inflate life vest! Jump. Jump! Good job. What happened, Badri? Why are you sad? It's nothing. Missing your mom? No... my Sister-in-law. Looking at you, I realized that... even she could have achieved a lot. Honestly, Vaidehi. Kritika would've been really proud to see you like this. Do you miss her? A lot. But I don't have the courage to talk to her. But I do. Here, talk to her. Huh! Talk to your sister. Hello. How are you? Kritika! Kritika, sorry. Stop wasting your time apologizing. We're talking after such a long time. Where are you? London... with Bhushan. We're here for a function. Wow... you're in London. Even you made it to Singapore. Vaidehi. Vaidehi, It's Bhushan... Hello, Bhushan... how are you? I am fine... You and Badri have cheated me... you told me that she is naive and innocent. But she's taken charge of the entire family. She's even made my father retire. Now we two travel around the globe... conducting religious functions together. Has Kritika been singing too in the programs? When she does... we will all have to retire. I am hanging up now, international calls are expensive. I will call you later. Kritika, I love you. I love you too. Thank you, Sergeant, thanks a lot. Sergeant... Sergeant... Does he want to stay here. He likes this country. Since you two got here... you're either beating people up or getting beaten up. What is this? This is your deportation paper. They are sending you back. Joking. This is your bail receipt. Who paid for it? Doesn't matter. No, but who paid for it? Vaidehi. Badrinath Bansal. Somdev Mishra. So... shall we go? Let's go. Thank you, Sergeant. Finally, where were you? Sorry, sorry... I went to collect my passport. You got your passport? Yes... You won't have to sleep... in my small hall anymore. I get great sleep in that hall. Show me your passport. Badrinath Bansal. Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? You look so stupid in your photo? Hello... You don't look like Deepika Padukone either. Everyone looks stupid in their passport photo? - Yes. It's my childhood photo. Badri, will you go outwith me today? Alone? Everyone will be there, but let's go out together. Let's party or something... So will you? Yes. Yes, I will. Okay, let's go. Come on... Ladies first. Now, give me my passport. You won't get entry in the club. I'll keep it. You look like a kid. And you look like an adult? Yes. Singapore... Alright, so my new song for all the Bollywood junkies... and my friends from India.

Call me... I'll make you talk with my wife and kids. Will you get married as soon as you go back? - Yes... There's a long list of girls waiting for me. So I have to. Come to Singapore. I will. For my honeymoon. Badri, thank you. What for? You know, since I was a kid... I always wanted to be their son. But I could never succeed. And when I got the job, I called home. I wanted to tell my father that I got a job. But he didn't talk to me. And I thought... that people like my father will never change. But even after what happened between us... we are sitting together here today... up high in Singapore. And it's all because of you. You're a very good guy. So thank you. Why do you want to be their son? You're already an amazing daughter. I've been watching you all these days... You're shone so much strength. You're making your own world here. I always believed... that I am the only man in all of Jhansi. That whoever marries me will be really lucky. But after meeting you, I realized... whoever marries you will be the lucky one. You're drunk and exaggerating. It's the truth. I see Promise. Okay... so when you have a daughter, call her Vaidehi. - Are you mad. I've already decided their names... Really? Tell me... Vaishnavi... Sarthaki... Rukmani... Prerna! I am okay, Badri. What? No... No... 20 days... and you couldn't find her? No... Are you being honest, Badri? What's the point of lying.. It's alright. If I see her, I will kill her my self. You don't worry. I've chosen a really nice bride for you. 'Dussehra' is next week. I've arranged a prayer meet for Urmila. Go... get some rest. Are you okay? What's the prayer-meet for? So Urmila has a son. And that will make her have a son? Thank god Vaidehi ran away. She would've suffocated here. How is Vaidehi? O cruel one... why are there these distances? where do I find you now... tell me, where will I find you now? tell me, where will I find you now? Listen, Oh my beloved Do you have the slightest idea of the way your breath travels ? I could live there, all my life... I could live there, all my life... I learnt to smile from you Only you, who my heart is attached to You are the faith of my life, I wish I could never come back to my senses again In your arms, I could spend my whole life Yes, I didn't know, That I would consider you as my God That I would come to your street so much, all the time Listen, Oh my beloved Do you have the slightest idea, of the way your breath travels ? I could live there, all my life... I could live there, all my life... What was he saying... Mr. Trivedi. Who invited them? I did! This is Mr. Vyas. He owns two petrol-pumps in Jhansi. I've fixed Badri's marriage with his daughter. And you must know Mr. Trivedi pretty well. He's become quite popular all over Jhansi... since his daughter ran away. Father, it's time to start... Yes... Somdev! Where is Badri? I'll go look. Tell him to hurry up. Come. Badri. Hello. You're drunk on the day of the prayer-meet. You will get us in trouble, Badri. Get down... They are calling you inside. Do I have to go? Of course you do. Hold my hand. Don't let go. Why are you hugging that shoe? Vaidehi gifted it to me. It's my favorite shoe. Great... hold it tightly. Don't let it go. Just keep quiet. Okay. You take such good care of me, Somdev. You're my best friend. I don't want to be your best friend anymore... It was a mistake. Just walk straight. I slapped you when we were in Singapore. Sorry. Listen to me carefully, Badri. Don't talk to anyone inside... In fact, don't open your mouth at all. Otherwise I will punch you. Hold my hand. Don't laugh! Walk straight... good Sister-in-law is sitting on the weighing-scale. It's a tradition. That's Mr. Trivedi... Hello! What are you doing, Badri? He's such a nice man. It's alright... Take your shoes off. And your glasses. Don't look at anyone, walk straight. Badri... Urmila, how are you? That's a nice sari Sit down. I don't want to. Fine... just stand straight. Join your hands. Why are you laughing, Badri? Badri? Badri, what are you doing? Mr. Priest... Priest.. Badri... get up... Tell me something... Badri? If one can have a son through all this... then why didn't you do it for yourself? You have four daughters yourself. Badri, you're not listening to me. Aren't you? Fooling people, aren't you? Badri! Badri! What? What Badri? I know my name is Badri. Badrinath Bansal. How do you do? This is Ambernath Bansal. Mr. Aloknath Bansal. My Mother Bansal. And that's... my Sister-in-law, Urmila Shukla. She left her name, her home... for us. And what did we do in return... Made her sit on this weighing-scale! Get up. Badri, what are you doing? Get up... What are you doing? Get up... get up... Badri, we'll go home and talk about this. But please keep quiet now. Quiet? Why should I keep quiet? Why should I keep quiet? Our mother stayed quiet all her life. She made us keep quiet. You're quiet too. And you asked Sister-in-law to stay quiet. But I'm done keeping quiet. Trivedi uncle... why are you sulking? Vaidehi is very happy in Singapore. She has become an air-hostess. She earns 150,000 a month. She is making you proud. I see... So all this is a result of her influence. Yes... correct... She taught me how to be a real man! To respect women. What did you teach us? "Kidnap her..." "We'll hang her in the street." Who teaches these things to his children? And what about the fact that she ran away? Thank God she ran away. Otherwise you would've made her sit on that weighing-scale... just like Urmila! It's 2017. This city of Jhansi... is popular because of a queen... Not a king! When will you understand, father? That didn't hurt! Father... Quiet... I am not a kid anymore. I am not... You want to hit me, don't you? If you want to hit me, hit me harder... harder... - Stop it, Badri! Badri! I miss her! I love her! I see her everywhere I look. Here... there... there... Why have you come here? Who just appears like this... This is not the right place for you... I am not the right guy for you. Go back to Singapore... You see... the stressful situation of my sudden appearance... is making your heart beat faster. You're blabbering... So tie your seatbelt... and breath slowly. Because if something happens to you... then I will have to marry someone else. Which I can't. Because I want to marry you. I love you a lot. Me too. I love you, Badri. I love you... You've chosen the worst time to start our romance. I'll talk to them. I know... I hurt you. I insulted everyone. I am very sorry for running away. But I thought that... Badri is not the right guy for me. But I was wrong... Absolutely wrong. I really love Badri, papa. And only I will be Badri's bride. What? I will be Vaidehi's groom. She will work in Singapore. And I am with her. If you understand, then good... If you don't... then may the Lord bless you. Somdev, don't clap. Why did you run away without telling me? Should I have taken your permission before? Yes. Did you take my permission before running away? Stop ranting about permission. I will... How do you spell permission? I don't know... But you will teach me. 'I stepped out as a modern male.' 'But the next two years was very difficult.' 'Vaidehi was working in Singapore...' '...and I was waiting.' 'I am truly grateful to Facebook and Skype...' '...through which I could see and talk to her everyday.' 'Two years later Vaidehi returned to Jhansi...' '...and the lover-boy was has surrendered all over again.' 'She has started her own training institute in Jhansi.' 'Now even the youngsters can dream of flying high.' Alok and Urmila had twins.' 'A boy and a girl.' 'Father keeps playing with both the kids all day.' 'He hasn't differentiated between them yet.' 'Maybe he's gradually changing too.' 'Urmila has her own cabin in the showroom.' 'She and Alok look after the business together.' 'Somdev's company had a successful stint too.' 'And he took the plunge as well.' I am still as useless as I always was. Life's sailing smoothly between collection and romance. I am thinking, when I have a daughter... I'm definitely going to demand dowry for her. - What? For our daughter. We won't for anyone. We won't. Have a good day. Why don’t you go and play Holi, O dear? Why don’t you go and play Holi, O dear? Everyone is asking about you That where is the bride of Badri?
