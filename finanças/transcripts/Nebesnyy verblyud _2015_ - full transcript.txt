(speaking in Kalmyk language) Altynka, hey, little baby! Run with us to the sky! Altynka, bring the rain! Mom, who's that? Don't bother your father. They're having an important talk. Is that Menke Davaich again? I hate him! You mustn't talk like that about adults! Go give Altynka some water. Mom, look. You're all dirty again. Come. Come. Where did you get so dirty? Sanalka got dirty. I'm too little. You're a witch! Bring some water, Sanalka. We'll have a wash. All the water's gone? How about some tea? I can make some thyme tea. Tea, really? How do you live here without air conditioning? This is the first really hot day. And here is that camel. Just like you wanted. Looks like it. But the color… Ours was pure white. You can paint it. You people do wonders in your movies. What breed is it? I've never seen anything like it. It's a Tengryn Botkhn. A what? "It means ""celestial baby camel"" in Kalmyk." What's that? Our Altynka was born under a lucky cloud. Look at his eyes! Under what cloud? A camel-shaped cloud. That’s a good sign. That’s what our grandpa said. Right, Dad? What happened to your camel? Why did it die? The pyrotechnics guys killed it. They blew up a shed, the wall was really thin. What? He said their camel burned on a film shoot. Burned to death? It's the movies! Dad, why did they blow up a shed? So, is it a deal? Bring it closer! Load it up! We have to hurry, the train's tonight. Bring the truck around! Dad! What are they doing? Open the truck! Why? Load up the camel! Hey, wait with the loading. What? You got some money? Maybe you want to pay me back that loan, eh? Go! Bring it here! I'll have money when I sell the wool in the fall. Wool! What if all your sheep die before the fall? - It will rain. There was a good sign. - And what if it won't? The steppe is dried out. What are you going to feed your kids? Wormwood, eh? - Is there a problem? - No problems! No problems! It’s the 21st century, and this man still believes in omens. His camp is the oldest in the steppe. And that water well… There's only water on the bottom! Will you use a camel to pump the water? Your generator doesn't work! My great-grandpa got water from this well, there'll be enough for us. - When it rains— - What if it doesn’t? What if it doesn’t? Did I bring you flour? Yes, I did! And I can get you anything! Your wife is due soon… Will you need blankets and shampoo? What will you bathe the baby in? Laundry soap? Saglara, it's okay. Anyway, here's 1000 dollars in rubles. A whole fortune for that baby camel! Minus… Did I bring flour? I did. And gas, and diesel… - Eh, is that right? People say you're rich if you have no debts! Right? - What’s the holdup? - Load it up! But be careful! Hold it tighter, so it doesn't kick! Take the goods off the truck! Dad, he's in pain, what are they doing? Stop them, Dad! Hey, careful! Not the Tengryn Botkhn! They'll kill him! It'll be bad for everyone! It'll be bad for who? Their grandpa was a bit cuckoo, believing in fairytales. It's not a fairytale! Altynka is a real Tengryn Botkhn! You should've asked for a bag of dollars, bought all the sheep in the steppe. You'd be the first khan. - I asked for something else! - Did you get it? - Altynka is still small, not strong enough! - What did you ask for? - I won’t tell you! See - he takes after his grandpa, full of fairytales and legends. - I was thinking… - About changing the money into dollars? No, don't… Okay, then. Close that truck! What's this? What's wrong with her? She's running over here. She's bellowing like a nutter! She's the baby camel's mother. They have instincts. If she reaches us, she'll kill us for sure. Get into the car. - Come on, come on, come on! Mara's gone mad. Get into the house, quick! Quickly! You're my oldest, so grownup already. You must understand. We, shepherds, are people. Camels are animals. Like sheep. If you get attached - you can’t butcher, eat or sell it. How will you feed your family? Grandpa Adyk said Altynka is not cattle. Grandpa told you tales, and you… miracles never happen… You really think so?… - That’s a sign from Saglara! Let's go, quickly! Well, Tengryn Botkhn, here is to you! - No, Medinsky doesn't allow this! - Who? Our doctor. And this… celestial camel… does he really grant wishes? And cures illnesses? It's just Kalmyk tales. Old Adyk made them up, and the kids believe them. Say hi to Hollywood! If this one dies, come back, we have more camels. The train's tonight, we have to hurry. Go straight through the steppe, turn left after that hill. I don't know the route through the steppe! See where that mailbox is facing? That's where you go. Make sure the wind blows in your right cheek. - You’ll be at the station in 3 hours. - Okay, I got it. They're coming! This way, hurry up! Dad, hurry up, she's over there! She's there, Dad! She's asking for you! Let me hold it . Wait! For me! Wait! Bair, clean the car up. I'll go with you, Mom! You can't! Mom is going to the medic to have a baby. I want to go to the medic to have a baby too! Go, I said! You brat. Mara drank a whole tub of water. Did you see? And she’s asking for more. Why? She's getting ready to run. If she runs to find Altynka, she'll die. You're in charge. Herd the sheep. And don’t let Mara out. We won't make it without her. Mom, take me with you! Dad, the coins! Here. Wishing you a white journey! Let's go. Mom! Mom! Have a white journey! Do mosquitoes have babies? They have lots. You see them flying around? Do they cry when their babies get killed? No. They just fart. How do they fart? Like camels? No. Quieter. 'Cause mosquitoes are little. And I'm big! And silly! You're silly! - Silly and little! - You’re silly! Silly and little! Bair, Bair, punish him! He's calling me names again! - Punish him! - Stop it! Mom'll come with the new baby, and we have no electricity! There, Mara. - And we have to put up with those brutes… Will we have electricity? The sun's set already. We will in a minute. Mara, you poor thing, don't cry. I miss him too. Let's cry together. Let me wipe this eye. Here, have my ribbon. Nobody understands us, women. Harder, let’s go! And one!… And two! There's no sugar. Sanalka doesn't let me have any because we have to save. Go, eat some grass. And again! And one! And two! And three! And four! - Is it on? - Yay! - Mara! Where are you going? - Mara! Mara! - Mara, stop! Mara come back! - Mara! Mara! Bair, she let Mara out! You should have your ears boxed. Or better, your bum whipped. I just wanted to give her the red ribbon. She just went. It's Sanalka's fault, I'm too little. The moon is round. Dead wind will blow from the salt marshes. If Mara lies down in a hollow, she'll die. I have to go find her. She's smart. She can sense water from 50 km. She'll find Altynka from 100. She’ll track his scent like a dog. Right? Your brain's as big as this sheep's. Yours is! Is this Grandpa Adyk's knife? He died. Now it’s my knife. Did he die forever? The bread! - And water. - There’s half a bucket left. Sugar. Bair, when will you bring Altynka home? If he comes back, will there be water in the well again? I have to find the mother camel. She can then pump water from the hole for sheep. I'll go with you. And she'll be left alone? You know how die-hard she is? And the sheep? They have to be watched! I'm always your go-to guy! And you're always my trouble! Trouble… Good luck! And find Mara! Bring Altynka back! Have a white journey! The coins! Tell him to have a white journey! It’s you who’s still a snotty-nosed kid! You witch! No, you're the witch! - Mara… Mara, where are you?! Come back! Mara!! Mara! Did you get lost? Is this yours? Let's go find your owner. Mara, Mara! Here's some sugar! Mara, come here! Stop! I lost a camel with a red ribbon. Ulan found it. And took it home. I'll take you there. Let's go, then? We'll go when we're done here. What's the tarp for? The steppe is dry. We’re calling a big rain. We have to collect water. (speaking Kalmyk) Let's go to Ulan. Thank you. Will it rain? You should pray. Don't be scared, it'll just sniff you. I'm not scared, no way. - Who are you? - Bair, and you? Alyona! Why are you on the roof? It's a full moon, the laundry'll soak up the power. It will hold out for ages. That's a lie! I tried it, my shirt ripped in 3 days. - Do you have my camel? - With a red ribbon? She's there, under the roof. Mara! What are you doing? I've been looking for you! Mom is at the clinic, the kids are all alone. You think I don't miss Altynka? But we have to keep living. There's been no rain all summer. The water in the well is very deep down. If you don't help us pump water, the sheep will die. Mom will bring back a new baby. We can't do without water. I'm in charge now. Dad told me to watch you, and you… are you ashamed? Hey, boy! Is this your camel? It is. I'm Bair, the son of Dorji the shepherd. Your camel found this on the road. It's Altynka's! Did you see him? No, just this camel. That's bad… We'll fix your bike by morning. Rest, sleep. You’ll go in the morning. Thank you! - Will it rain? - A dry thunderstorm. That's a bad sign! Go into the house, quick! Hurry! Hurry!! What? Excuse me! I have tickets, and a precious cargo! Your assistants say there are no trains! That's right, all trains are cancelled. Did you see the storm? All rails are meter-deep in sand. I have to get the camel to the American movie shoot in time! You want the locomotive to run through the sand? That's it - the weight's reached the floor! Unload the camel! I have a job at 5! Go sleep in the service car! Mara! Mara!! She broke the paddock. She’ll keep looking for her baby until she finds him. The camel mother will look for her son. She'll find him or die. The tracks go through the dry lake. Then there are sweating stones and the dead river. There's no way across it. It's a deadly place. What if Mara went there? There's bad vapors from the dead river, people have seen things. Here. But I have one. It's a good knife. Cover it so a bad person doesn't see it. Thank you! Find your Celestial Camel, son! Here! Take this. For good luck. Thank you! These are bortsoks. A camel made from dough. Have a white journey! Beyond the bloody river are caves and a spring! Camels always drink there! Ah, there you are! Did you clear the sand off the tracks? Sure! We slaved away half the night! Is the boss here? There! He's checking the tracks. Watch the camel, give it some water. I'll go see the boss. I'll be right back. You should give me more! I'll pay you, watch the camel! I have a special cargo. We're expecting a special train. As soon as it's gone, you're first to go. - When will it come? - We don’t know. You know, I can finance… You know what, good sir, you can finance all you want. But until the special train passes… All traffic is forbidden. We're expecting big bosses. I have a very valuable cargo. - Do you watch TV?! - Of course I do. Help me out here, boss. As soon as that special train passes, you'll go, too, and your camel will. Until then - no way, even if you give me money. Who's coming? We know nothing. Mara! Here's some sugar, Mara! Mara! Mara! I'm not scared. Come on! Hey! Is it true that you monks see through the earth? I'm not a monk, I'm just a disciple. My camel ran away. Have you seen her? No, I haven’t. Stop bothering me! Maybe I should pray, like you? Prayer always helps. God, help me find Mara. Or Dad will whip my butt. God, why am I always punished, and it's never Jirgalka and Sanalka's fault? Hey? Maybe I should pray louder? God, do you hear me? Mom is having a baby! And the others are still little! And most importantly, there's no rain! Mara went to get Altynka, you know. We just can't do without a camel! Otherwise we're doing great! Let all people on Earth be as happy and healthy... as us. Was that okay? Now I'm completely distracted! Maybe you can pray for me? They know you there! You hear that ring? It rings, so what? It rings twice as long. So what? This is a place of power. Magnetic fields cross here, hence the sound. They've been looking for a place to put a holy stupa. What's the stupa for? - Have you seen the dead river? - I have. If there's no holy stupa, the whole steppe will be dead. That's bad! And I… I found this place! Cool! What's this place? There's power coming from the earth. I noticed it back in the fall. Right here. Cranes sit here before they fly south. Why? Are you stupid or something? They gather strength. And camels? Do they gather strength here, too? Especially camels! Then Mara is here. Can you pray as bait? If a camel left, it is meant to be. For whom? Who needs it to be like that? You'll understand one day. And for rain? Can you pray for rain? The steppe is dying! For rain? I can’t pray for rain yet. That's some lama you are… I'm not a lama, just a disciple. The master'll learn that I found this spot. Then I'll be the best disciple in the monastery! Well, I have to go… Do you want a ride? I have a bike. Each has his own path. Well, as you wish. If your camel was here, it’ll go that way. There's a spring there. But it's a bad place. I know, I've been told. Thanks! Have a white journey! The water's gone, don't sweat it. Have a white journey. Have you seen a camel? With a red ribbon on her head? - Are you alone? - I am. Can you give me a ride to the station? I have to look for my camel. She came here, from the red river. They say it's a bad place. And I lost her track. She’ll die! Lost it? So it doesn't matter where you go, then. Okay, get on. Wait. Two more bags and we'll go. What is this? Heavenly pleasure. Two more bags. Stop! I said stop! How many are there? Stop! Damn it! Hold that boy! Freeze, everyone! Freeze right there! Where's the other one? Where's the second guy? The man in the bandana? He went there, into the cave. Come on, let's go. What is it? God knows! Do you have a flashlight? Hey, boy, do you have a flashlight? No. No! It's deep! God knows where it leads! Probably to the North Pole. - So you’re a joker? - Bingo! Look at that! Well, pal, let's go! Where? To see the penguins! Come on, start it up. Let's go! What a piece of junk. Let's go. Just in time for lunch! Is it pot-noodle again? With new potatoes, though! Take this. Write it up. And this thing, too, separately. A double case. What for? Put the boy into the cell. Come on, move it! What did you grab the boy for? Weed! We grabbed him next to the stash. He's slaving for a master. I don't have any master, honestly! Go on. You're all honest here... You'll remember when I get back. Who you picked it with, for whom, who's the master. Got that? It says something… Is it in Kalmyk? By the way, your knife is 12 centimeters long. It's my grandpa's knife! That makes it a weapon. That's a separate charge. Couldn't you add canned beef? We can’t keep eating potatoes like cows! Like he's boss enough for meat at my expense. Or a chocolate-glazed snake! I can catch a snake for you if you want. They taste good. We fakirs know how to charm them, and cook them. I can go and catch one right now, so delicious! - I can do tricks, too! - I know your tricks! How to swipe a woman's purse - that's a popular trick! I found that purse! And it only had a 100 and change in it! And the monogramed men's wallet? That's your family heirloom? Why not? I know your family name - you go by Quarter, an orphanage runaway. You thieve at train stations. Right? Right? Officer, I'm a performer! I do magic tricks, I don't steal. Have you seen my magic wand? You croak some more,… I’ll turn you into a toad. Got it, fakir? Hello, second here! I’m bringing it now! Do you hear me, boy? Hey, boy! What? You’re in serious trouble. Weed is drugs. There’s a campaign now! The more arrests of your kind, the more they get paid. But I’m here because of a mistake! Me, too! - It was this one guy in a bandana! - No, you won’t get out of it now. They'll put you in a juvenile detention center What do I do now? There, see the keys on the desk? By the hot plate? Your knife's there, too. Reach to the desk leg. Yank it, the keys'll fall, we'll get them and run away together! - You’re not lying? - I swear by my mom! Come on! Come on! Grab that cable! Grab it! I can't! Try going lower! Reach! Grab the white cable, that's the extension cord! Pull it! Come on! Come on!!! That's it, we can't reach it now… Look what you've done! I didn't do it on purpose! I didn't know it was that far. Don't worry! We've performed more complicated tricks! As we say in the circus - allez hop! Let’s shake, bro. Freedom! Come on, hurry up! This is mine! Are you stupid? Let's go! Or they'll catch us! Slow down! Now go, go! Go to the steppe! Hang a left there. See, you can’t lose with Quarter as your friend! I bring luck! - I’ll run out of gas soon. - Go to that hill! - My pals are pumping over there. - What do you mean? They pump oil from the pipe, turn it into gas and sell it. Don't worry! Cops won't go there. I'll give you any grade you want. I'm like their foster son. You can be, too. Turn there! No, I have to go home. I'll find my camel and go back. Go behind that hill, my pals will find your camel, too. Sir Michael, I'm telling you in plain English! (in broken English) Railway station closed! Is possible helicopter only! That foreign bastard! Put Barankulov on the phone! What? Hello? I ran out of minutes. It’s all because of you! You celestial beast! Should I wash it? Just give it grass and water for now. We'll wash it before leaving. When's that? When the Moscow bosses free the road for us! Not for a while, then. I'll go to the village for now, maybe I'll find a truck. You'll take it to the shoot in a truck? For 1500 kilometers? That'll cost a lot, they won't sign off. Impossible. Okay, grass, water, what else. Call me if… Ah, the phone's dead. Shut up, you beast! It's all your fault! - Even a beetle won’t sneeze for free. - I’ll pay you later! 500 now, and then extra for each day. These people, always wanting to eat their fellow man alive. Make sure it's all spiffy! Yes, sir! There! There! Turn there! Stop! Attention, please! Allez hop! Applause! Thank you. Here it is. Highest grade gas. Guaranteed! 98 if you want, or 76, or diesel. Tons of money! We just pump it from the pipe. - So you’re stealing it? - We’re living! And letting others live! Is this can good? Good. You can always come to me! I can do anything here, I’m like their son. What's this? It’s a local memorial. Let’s go! Here you are! Who is this? Chucha. Our local memorial man. He guards everything here. Chucha! See that? He’s having a hard time. Is this mineral water? Like hell it is. Here is your favorite delicacy, Chucha. The gas is spilling over there. Don't worry! Ah, we have tons of that crap! Let's go! Good! If you want, I can fill a 100 cans like this for you. One’s enough for me. Thank you. That was cool! That wasn’t cool! Come on! Where? The miracles continue! Here! Be amazed. What is this? Caviar? Dig in with a spoon! Is this vodka? More than vodka - 98% alcohol! If you drink it, you go blind or stupid. And Chucha can still see! - What about you? - I don’t drink that crap. I do tricks with it! Go on, eat, stretch yourself over this! - How? - Like a snake over an elephant! - I was talking about tricks. - Ah! Come on! Please take your seats, everyone! Applause! Attention! Attention! Attention! You are about to see the famous fakir, the beloved Quarter! And his assistant and simply a good friend - Bair! Drumroll! Applause! What the…?! Hop… What is this, a trick? Or…?! Or!!!! Put it out before it explodes! The extinguisher is empty! Chucha, get up! We’re on fire! Hurry up, it doesn’t work! Let me! Don't, it's the crap from the toilet, makes it burn even worse! Come on, push it! Push, from behind! Push it! Push it! Where's the brake? That's it, I'm dead. Chucha saw it, they'll kill me… They'll find me anywhere. I am… was like their son. They won't recognize you. Why? Because you’re black now, like an African. And you're like a Papuan. Here's to international friendship! Catch! The spot didn't wash out. Let's see! They don't stink, that's most important. Iron our shoelaces and we're VIPs! I'm hungry. It's too bad all the food burned back there. Here. That's great. Stretch yourself over this. What's this? And this? Eat the rest, but don’t touch this. Is this like a charm camel? Did your Mom bake it? Not my mom. Just… a good friend. You're lucky. You have a mom, a dad. A friend… And I only remember Grandma. I loved her… When she was dying, she called me over… and slapped me! Her hand was heavy, all callused. Real steel. I was little, I stood there, crying. She turned to the wall, crying, too. - Why? - Why what? Why did she hit you? Are you stupid? So I won't miss her when she's gone. See. She left this for me. It's a charm. A silver quarter. From the Tsar's days. She said, Lyokha, when you're done being a thief, give it to someone else. This luck will go to him, and you'll get new luck. Lyokha? Lyokha, yeah. Nobody called me that at the orphanage. They just called me Quarter. I don't mind. I bring luck, people should be friends with me! Maybe the Americans will film me, too? Am I worse than a camel? I'll start a new life then. You know what I'm going to be? What? A real artist! I'll perform in a circus! Where's the circus? Far away, in Moscow. You take me to the station, I'll ride cargo trains. I'll come and go to circus school. I'll study to be a fakir! Will you blow fire again? Look! A girl is coming! Let's get in the water! Go away! As if I want to look at you! Bair, cover yourself! - What?! - Your camel… Did you find Mara? People saw her by the railway station. Nobody can control her. Go get her! That's some kind of hero, with a naked butt! You're stupid! - You’ll marry her. - No way. I have an all-seeing eye. They'll torture that baby camel to death. Let it go! It’ll be fine. It’s a ship of the desert! One beer per hour and we'll sail. Take the camel to the shoot. They’ll kill it! You're crazy, old man. This piece of junk won't go far. Where are you going? Get up! Get up! Look, a camel going free! Tie up its legs! Not here, over the fence! Give me the rope! Where are you going, you beast! It'll break the gate! Come here! That beast! It ripped the rope! Run, silly! Why did you untie the little one? They must be mother and son. The hell with you. Where are you going? Where are you going, you monsters? Don't touch the little one. The mother can kill you. What will I tell my boss? Are they yours? Altynka… Mara! Look, it's them! Altynka! We found you! Why are you so dirty? It's okay, you're still celestial! Altynka… Mara, you found him. Good job! We'll go home now. I told you you'd find them! We fakirs have all-seeing eyes! Here! Murderers! I’ll personally shoot you! - It wasn’t me, it was him! - You! Where’s the camel?! You should run! There's some commotion starting there! Run! Or they’ll send someone after you! Take this train while the governent train is in the steppe, or it'll be too late! We'll go, we'll take it! - Hurry, run! - And you? Each train has tons of these boxes. I'll write you when I reach Moscow! Where? Where will you write? Where? - Okay, bye now! - Wait, Lyokha! Here's the milk and everything that's left… Now go! Don’t stick around here. Or I'll be too sad to leave you. Lyokha… Go, I'm telling you! Brother… I'm going, brother. And don't look back! What was I thinking, dealing with a juvenile. Have a white journey! Go to hell! Pals! Save me! I'll pay you a load of money! - It’s leaving in an hour! - Let’s go! You won’t regret it! - Is the pay good? - 3000! For all of you! And a bottle each! - 750 ml bottle? - Yes! Hey, guys, let's go! Come over here! Grab a hook, the camel's mad! Get on here! Let's go! I'll take command! What's wrong? What have they done, the bastards. There they are! Mara, Altynka, run! Hey, boy! Where are you pulling our camels? Stop! Do you hear? Run to the steppe! Bad people are coming! Run through the lake! You stupid beast, hurry up! Why are you standing there? Altynka! Come on, let's go! What are you doing, boy? These are our camels! You can't take Altynka! He's celestial! Tengryn Botkhn! They'll kill him! Celestial? That's a Kalmyk tale! People paid and can do what they want! Get out of here, thief! And don't touch our camel! Take him! Stop kicking. Chase the big one away! We were only paid for the little one. Give me the hook! There! Hook the neck! Careful, she'll kill you! Get out of here, I said! Go on! No! Don't, you're hurting her! Let go! Go! Why are you standing there, let's go! - What’s the holdup? - He’s resisting, kicking and crying! Punch him in the face! Look at that! You don’t have the guts to kill a man yet,… you little brat. What, did you pee your pants? Very funny! Jump in, hurry or we’ll be late! Let's go! Here! And tell your dad to teach you how to use it! Let's go home, Mara. I knew you'd find her! Lamb shoulder bones told me! Mara is here! Where’s Altynka? Where's Altynka? Really, where is he? Bair? Where's Altynka? Get lost! She’s out for a walk! Right? Tell him about the girl instead! Really, Bair, we have a new girl! This tiny! She moves her legs and squeals! She pooped 3 times already. Sanalka washes the blankets, doesn't let me. He says I'm too little! If I say you're little, then you're little! There he goes again! You’re little! ♪ Celestial baby camel brings rain, ♪ ♪ grass grows, and animals gain weight. ♪ ♪ Grass grows, and animals gain weight. ♪ ♪ Celestial baby camel brings rain, all people on earth will be happy. ♪ ♪ All people on earth will be happy. ♪ ♪ Jump and dance, celestial baby camel, fly to the sun. ♪ ♪ Jump and dance, celestial baby camel, fly to the sun. ♪
