Stay-at-home lockdown? I guess we can't leave. What about our families? I don't know. How long do you think this will last? Maybe a few weeks. It'll go by fast. [COUGHS] [COUGHS] [DOORBELL RINGS] -Hey! -My baby! -Ate! -Oh, I missed you so much. [ALL EXCLAIM] I missed you. -Look at you. You've grown bigger. -Oh, my God. [INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER] You look so good! Yes. Oh, wow... I'm so happy. Okay, come in. Come in. It's so cold. -Are they asleep? -Yeah. Finally, they're sleeping. Good. It's so good to have you home again. We missed you so much. Oh, I miss you, too. It's been so long. That's why we wanted to visit. Yes, very long. You know what, Chris? When I was at your age, I had a beard. Wherever I went, everyone looked at me. You know what my friends called me? -What, Uncle? -Bobo. Bobo? Do you know what that means? CHRIS: No. -Hairy vagina. -Dad! What? It's the truth. 'Cause my beard was so thin. Okay, okay. Let's just change the subject. So, Chris, are you still unemployed? -Mom! -What? I just wanted to know. Uh, it's been tough with the pandemic and I'm still trying to find a job. Oh, okay, so find a new job. Mom! You know, in the Philippines, we all grew up poor. We couldn't afford things like chocolates. You know, those See's candies. Very, very popular. I would dream of tasting that. So when I first arrived here in America, that's the first thing I tried. And when I bit into that thing, oh, it was everything to me. I cried. And said, "This is what freedom tastes like." Nowadays, you all take everything for granted. Mom, Chris is working really hard to find a job. And when are you both really going to get married? I mean, what's even taking so long? Mom, If you're gonna keep talking like that, we're gonna go. You know, the pandemic really delayed us. We're still planning it, but it's just been really... But you told me you would marry Hillary before COVID. And now, two years later, still no wedding. Still no baby. -Mom. -You know, I saw on the TV, a lot of people getting married in their backyard. -Why don't you get married in the backyard? -[SIGHS] Mom, we're not going to get married in the backyard. Why not? It doesn't cost a lot of money. I can cook. You know, when I was your age, I got married in the rice field with the carabao. Remember, Daddy? And you know what? Your dad, he stepped in poo-poo. So the whole time we said our vows, we smelled like tae. Mom, we're going to get married when the time is right. First you say you wait, and then two years go by. You say you wait again. At this point, you'll always be waiting. [SIGHS] When are you two going to get your life together and start a family? I'm not hungry. That was a disaster. You okay? Yeah, I'm... I'm fine. Hey, I love you. I love you most. -I love you mostess. -[CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] My mom is just such a jerk sometimes. No, she's just straight-up. You know how moms are. Yeah, but all she wants us to do is get married and start a family right away. If I had the money, I'd marry you right now. Even when I proposed to you, I didn't even have that much money. I asked my mom to help me get this ring on consignment. But you know what? It all worked out because we're still here. Well, I pray that we get married when the time is right. I pray so, too. WOMAN: [ON VIDEO] Don't let this pandemic stop you from experiencing a beautiful life with the person you love. I am Christine Chang, and I know my thing when it comes to weddings. And I've realized over the years that if you love someone, you'll do anything in your power to make it work. Even if there is no way. So, let me help you live, love, and create your way to that big day. DM me for a free consultation. MAN: [ON VIDEO] I'm sorry. So sorry. [LAUGHS] [TYPING] ♪ You sick of all the same dudes Runnin' up ♪ Follow you around Hope you fall in love ♪ But they don't see you like I do, yeah, yeah ♪ All you friends They see it, too ♪ That I'm the one who looks you in the eyes ♪ Speaking like I'm meaning what's inside, oh, oh ♪ Know these others Try and play the part... ♪ Hello? Is the Wedding Hustler here? Hello. Oh. Hey! Hey. How may I help you? You scared me. Um... I don't know where to begin. Well, let me guess. You probably saw an ad on your phone. You're looking for the Wedding Hustler. How do you know? Well, number one, you're Asian, so you're probably cheap like me. Number two, you look Filipino, which means you're always looking for a bargain. And number three, judging by your fast fashion, you're probably short on cash. Wow. [CHUCKLES] I know. I should get paid more, right? Follow me. Could you send me the contract by end of day today? Yes. Mm-hmm. All right. Thanks, Julius. Hmm. I'm going to ask you one quick question, and that's going to tell me everything I need to know about you. Okay. Are you willing to do anything for your partner? Yes. So, when I mean anything, I mean anything. Yes. Why? I don't know. Because I love her. What's your definition of love? Sacrifice? Um... Doing whatever it takes. Okay, let's take it up a level. Is love a feeling or is it a choice? A feeling. Are you sure? No. Okay, so why do you feel like it's a feeling? I don't know. I feel for her. She feels for me. We feel on each other. Feelings come and go. One day, you're gonna feel like, "I'm the luckiest guy on the earth." The next day, you may feel like you don't even want to be with this person. So, if you choose to be with someone, that's commitment. So, love is not a feeling. It's a choice. Hmm. So now that you have that understanding, are you sure you want to proceed? Yes. Mm. I don't know. Because I don't just work with anyone that walks in here. I also choose who I want to work with. Just like how you chose to be here. Now, I'm gonna make sure that you're in it for good. Yeah, I'm in it. Well, planning a wedding is probably the most stressful thing in one's life. And seeing that you're here by yourself, that's going to be twice as stressful for you. I can handle it. Okay, then what's your fiancee's favorite color? Pink. Then what's her favorite flower? Actually, how about the dress? We all know it's all about the dress. You get that wrong, you might as well forget about this whole thing. I've never ever seen a guy walk in here alone thinking that he can handle this. Well, I'm different. I mean, I may not know her favorite color or her favorite flower, but I do know that I'm here. And that should say a lot. Okay, fine. When's the wedding? May 6th. Oh. That is in 45 days. Oh, my gosh. Why isn't she here with you? I don't know. I just wanted to try to do something special and surprise her. Okay, so you're a hopeless romantic. I get it. I like it. But before we start, what's your budget? Budget? -You don't have a budget? -I don't have a budget. So, how are you going to plan this without a budget? I've got, like, 9,000, but it's, you know, me and Hillary's savings. Oh, gosh, 9,000. Okay, so I start at 8,000. Can't you give me a discount? Aw. You are Filipino. I can't go that low. I have a business to run here. All this talk about love and you can't even help me out? You said it yourself. You've never helped someone like me. Well, now's your chance. Imagine all the other grooms you can help, surprise their fiancees. I mean, you can make a lot of money. Sorry, I can't help you. Man, you just wasted my time. You know what? You really are a wedding hustler. You hustle people out of their money. And this love is a feeling bullshit is all just a ploy to get people to buy. -See you next week. -The Wedding Hustler is wack. He was cute. He's broke. [SIGHS] Can I tell you something? -Go. -I've been with you for a long time. I've been with you since you first opened. I've been with you when you had your first client. It's not easy to plan a wedding on your own, much less surprise someone. You always tell me you love what you're doing. And you tell your clients there are two special days in their lives. The first day is when they were born, and the second day, is they find out why. Now, this is your why. Get your ass out there and help him. Okay. Fine. That's not why they call me the Wedding Hustler. They call me that 'cause I negotiate the best prices. You want to work with me? Be here tomorrow at the same time. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Hey. -Hey. -What's up, Christian? -What's going on, my brother? -Hey. -Hey, Hillary. -WOMAN: Hey. -Hey, Steph. -Hey. When are you gonna marry this girl? I'm working on it. You've been saying this for years now. Well, this time, it's for real. Mm-hmm. He put a ring on it at the beginning of the pandemic. What's your excuse? Thanks, Steph. All right. All right. So what are we having? -So, we're going to have a barbecue chicken... -Actually... Do you mind if I order first? -Okay. -Have a seat. Quick. I need your help. I don't know her favorite color. Damn, bro. You guys been together for how long? And you don't remember her favorite color? Watch this. -Your favorite color is green. -Your favorite color is blue. That's because you two are married. -That's why you're not married. -[BELL DINGS] -And that's why I put a ring on it. -[BELL DINGS] CHRIS: That's your favorite color, right? -Where? -This. Green. No. But it is around here somewhere. Where? I can't believe you don't remember my favorite color. I know yours is green. Not just any kind of green. Moss. Nice. Well, I just can't think of your color right now. Taupe. Taupe? I've never heard you say that color before. Yes, I did. You just don't pay attention to me. I always pay attention to you. Okay. What's my favorite food? -Sinigang? -No. -Not Sinigang? -No. Oh, lumpia. That was luck. No. I just know you like that. -[GASPS] -It's hot. Mm. You okay? -I burned my tongue. -You okay? -Yeah. -It's okay. You're good. Let's begin. So they say planning a wedding is one of the most stressful things in one's life. Unfortunately, you're alone in this fight. But not completely. I'll help you navigate you through these vendor sharks out there. See, there's one rule to remember. Everything is negotiable. Keep that in your mind and your heart. No matter what these people say... "This is my final price..." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You don't have that much money here. So, gotta negotiate everything down. You got it? Got it. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Now this is your crash course on everything you need to know about weddings. What's the first thing you notice here? I don't know, uh... -The flowers? -Aesthetics. Yes, exactly. This is why I asked you what your fiancee's favorite flowers were. -And do you know that yet? -No. Uh, but I do know her favorite color. I took her out to dinner and I asked. Oh. Clever. Date night. A mission accomplished. Now, how do you feel being here? Feel good. Mm. Why do you think that is? I don't know, um... Maybe because it's a beautiful day? No. Chris, I need you to think harder on this. Have you ever been to a theme park? Yeah. Okay. So when you go to a theme park, why do you think you feel so good? It's not the smell of the cotton candy. It is not just the happy people around you. So let me ask you again. Why do you think you feel so good? I don't know. Uh, the music? Bingo. See, I knew you were smarter than you looked. So it's not just about the aesthetics. As soon as you walk into the venue, the music needs to hit you. It's where the emotions build from. Hmm. All this sounds expensive. [SIGHS] Relax. That's why I'm here. [SPEAKS KOREAN] Here. Touch this. Yeah, it's fake. If you're on a budget and you can't afford real flowers, fake and dry ones are just as beautiful and they last forever. You can just rent this display here. Savings, 50%. And can't afford that band? That's fine. Just hire a really good DJ. Savings, 80%. Wow. I know. You're welcome. Now, what's Hillary's favorite dessert? I don't know. Uh, ube? Chris, this isn't Goldilocks. Think harder. Uh... Okay. Okay. So when you go home today... [SIGHS] Can you just be more stealth, please? Like a Navy SEAL. You can't just randomly go and ask questions. You're gonna get shot at the face. And this cake here... How much do you think this cake is? Uh... 50 bucks? Mm. It can go up to 1,000. -What? -Yeah. So, what I do is we get a really beautiful cutting cake, and the guests will get a slice from a sheet cake so you can save more money. Wow. And speaking of saving more money... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING OVER CAR STEREO] -Where are we going? -Seafood City. CHRISTINE: And this is where we find all your deals. Seafood City? Really? Mm-hmm. And rule number two, don't ever underestimate affordability. [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER PA] CHRISTINE: Take a bite out of it. -CHRIS: Like right now? -Yeah. Right now. We don't have that much time. Go. I think we should buy it first. Ah, it's fine. Just take a bite. -It's good. -Yeah, damn right, right? Okay, so, have you tried the wine here before? -No. -Okay. Wash your hands and meet me at the wine station. Here. Drink it. -All of it? -Just a little bit. -It's good. -And it's affordable. It's 1999. Wow. Yeah, just a few bottles of this and your guests, they'll be dancing all night. Sir, you're not supposed to be drinking in the store. We're just tasting before we're buying. You're right. Sorry. How was it? [EXHALES] Interesting and embarrassing at the same time, I see you're getting to know the real side of Christine Chang. Yeah, Chris, it's too late now. You're in it until the mission's accomplished. -Let's go out. -Like now? -What about this food? -Who cares? Let's do something random. You know, spice things up a bit. -Okay. -Go wear that dress you like. Okay. Okay. Where are we going? Uh, it's a surprise. What's the occasion? I just want to spice things up a bit. Ooh, I like it. [CHUCKLES] -Thank you so much. -Thank you so much. See? Told you I'd spice things up a bit. Oh, yeah, this is pretty spicy. Hey, I have to use the restroom real quick. -Facilities are in the back. -HILLARY: Oh, thank you. I need your help. Sure. What's up? I forgot my fiancee's favorite flowers. -You forgot her favorite flowers? -Shh. I know. I know. I'm terrible. You think you can help me out? How would I do that? I don't know. You can ask her what her favorite flower is. But don't you think we should be a little bit more discreet than that? Good point. Um, what do you think we should do, then? Hmm. Come on, I don't have all day. Okay, um... How about I say we are giving away flowers to couples who can tell me what their favorite flowers are? Perfect. But what if she asks you what her favorite flower is? Damn, good point. Um... Then I'll ask her what her favorite flowers are. But then what if she asks you to answer it? Damn. She's coming. Okay, let's just roll with it. I'm not doing this for free. What? Here's my Venmo. She's coming. Okay. How much do you want? -Twenty bucks. -Twenty bucks? Take it or leave it. Fine. -Hey. -HILLARY: Hey. -Just admiring the architecture here. -Oh, okay. -We're giving away flowers today. -[GASPS] Oh, that's amazing! Yeah. Yeah. And all you have to do is tell me what your favorite flower is. -Yeah. -Well, he knows mine. I do. And I know it, uh... Let me start with mine first, you know. My favorite flower is, um... Chrysanthemum, because it has the word "Chris" in it. -Mm. -Right? See? So what's yours? You know mine. Yes, I do know yours. Um... And it's probably in the cousin realm of chrysanthemum and the color purple, right? -Mm-hmm. -So that must mean it must be... Platy... codon. What's that? No, it's not. Okay, uh, if it's not that, then... Damn, at this point, it's probably in the cousin of color purple, which is lavender? [GASPS] Yes, that's it! -Oh, my gosh! -Congratulations. -Oh, thank you. -Here you go. -Thank you. -Yeah. -Hey! -HILLARY: Whoa! Whoa! Damn. Why you pushing me? So I was like, "Chrysanthemum?" And then she busts out, "Lavender." And I was like, "Right." Okay, I don't want to rain on your parade, but if it took you that long to find out her flowers, Chris, you got so many more important things to cover like venue, food, her dress. If you mess that up, they're not going to forgive you. Now, for the next mission, you got to be more incognito. You got a buddy you can trust? Yeah, my buddy Vern. Okay. So, you guys are going to have to partner up on this one. So, Vern will ask all the questions so she does not catch on. And to ask the right questions, I'm going to take you to go see the dressmaker. [SEWING MACHINE RUNNING] CHRIS: Hello. CHRISTINE: Seychelle! Christine, is that you? Oh, my goodness! -I brought you a client. -[GASPS] Oh, wow. You know, I'm all booked for my tuxedo designs. No, no. He wants a dress. Ooh, wow. [CHUCKLES] I love making dresses for men. CHRISTINE: No, it's for his fiancee. Oh, well, where's your fiancee? I'm throwing her a surprise wedding. [GASPS] Wow, a surprise wedding? [GASPS] I love it. You know, in all my years of doing this, I've never seen a surprise wedding before. You have such a wonderful heart. -Oh, thank you. -SEYCHELLE: Please, have a seat. So, before I begin, I just want you to know that we put so much care into these dresses. Every single one we make brings together farmers and scrapers, and weavers, all from the Philippines. Now, think about all those people. It takes a village to make the perfect dress. Much respect to everything you've designed here. Wow. Now, how much are you willing to spend? I'm not too sure. It's okay. How much do you think you're willing to spend? Uh... Not much. Well, that's going to be a challenge. You know, if you cannot spend that much, because I have to know before I can show you what I can do for you. How much are some of your basic packages? Everything I do is custom. So, with each dress, you know, I design it by asking specific questions. Well, how much did your last dress go for? 4,000. 4,000? I can't afford that. Let me ask you a question. Can you spend 4,000 on the woman you're willing to spend the rest of your life with? The woman who will bear your future children? I mean, I can. I just don't have that much. Okay. What can you do? -A thousand? -Oh, 1,000 is too low. I can't do that. -Well, what can you do? -4,000. Do you mind if I have a private word with my wedding planner... -Hustler? -Sure. Thank you. [SEWING MACHINE RUNNING] Chris, you're doing great. She's just trying to hardball you. I think we can get her down to 2,000. -How do we do that? -The walk-away method. Not like the rude walk away, but more of the polite, pity walk away. You can say something like, "I really love your work. "You do beautiful dresses here, but I just can't afford it." Then you walk away. 50% of time, it works... -If you're lucky. -Okay. Ooh, so what will it be? [SIGHS] I just want to say thank you for everything you do. But right now, I just can't afford it. -So, thank you. -Hmm. Filipino? -Excuse me. -Are you Filipino? Yes. I thought you were Chinese or Vietnamese. You don't look Filipino. Since you are Filipino, I have a kababayan special. I'm happy to lessen my profit to make this happen for you. But we still must pay our partners fairly. And the only thing I ask is you cannot tell anyone this special price. Not even Christine. CHRIS: Okay. Just like you trust me with your fiancee's special dress, I trust you will not let anyone know this special price. Okay. Thank you. You coached him well. Okay, now we can officially begin. This is the fun part. [CHUCKLES] What I do is I make custom dresses built from scratch, made of pineapple from the Philippines. Now, before I make the dress, I ask, you know, specific questions, and based on these questions, I'm always 100% right. Your bride will like it. -CHRIS: Okay. -Okay. What was the first thing you remembered when you laid eyes on your fiancee for the first time? Huh. Um... I guess how beautiful she was and, you know, how we were just in her car and she was smiling, and I just felt like I was so lucky to be there with her. Aw. What was the most difficult problem you encountered and how did you solve it? Okay. Um, difficult problem? Um... [SIGHS] It was one time when we were arguing and she was yelling at me and I was yelling at her and I just started shouting. But then I got this huge cramp in my heart, and I just thought I was going to die and realize we were just there, you know, killing each other and to just let it go. And from there, we just held each other. And we got through it. "Killing each other." Wow. Beautiful. Very beautiful. Now, last question. Why do you truly love her? I just feel like she's the greatest girl. I don't know, I love her, she loves me. She's into God and she's so positive and... [SIGHS] I guess at the end of day, I don't know, love is a choice. Oh. I'm gonna cry. That was beautiful. Now you're going to ask her the same questions. Then I will design it. Uh, of course, we still need her measurements. You're going to have to get that, too. -Oh, and you also have to ask her mom. -Her mom? Yes, it's very important that I know her mom's first impressions of you. And any difficult problems you both had and how you go through it. And also, you know, why her mom thinks her daughter loves you. That's gonna be tough. You'll find a way for love. [SEWING MACHINE RUNNING] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Yeah. Thank you. -[SPEAKING JAPANESE] -Thank you. How much did you take her down to? I can't tell you that. Come on. I'm not gonna tell her. Maybe it's a test. Maybe you're testing me. I am not going to tell her. I don't know. I just wanted to do a good job. I feel like this is such a beautiful creation. And if I say something, maybe she might mess up. -I don't know. Maybe I'm being superstitious. -[SIGHS] -[SPEAKS KOREAN] -What does that mean? That means I'm annoyed in Korean. I'm just being honest. Okay, well, keep your honesty to yourself. There are so many more negotiations to make. Let's see how honest you are then. Anyways, onto the next thing, wedding band. Hmm. I already gave her a wedding band. Was it a band or a ring? Oh, uh... That's the one I used when I proposed. That's the engagement ring. The same thing. No, not the same thing. A band, we use on the wedding day. It symbolizes the union of the marriage. What are you going to give her? The same engagement ring you already have on her finger? I thought that's how it works. No. What... What am I going to do? There's already a ring on her finger. Why should I have to put another one? [CHRISTINE SIGHS] CHRIS: Thank you. That's just how traditional weddings go. And the ring symbolizes when two become one. Well, I don't have enough money to buy another ring. And I'm doing this whole surprise. I've invested everything I got. I'm just getting overwhelmed. It's okay. It's okay. We'll go with Rocksbox. See? It's a jewelry of rental subscription box. How much is it? It's about $20 a month. Okay. How does it work? So, they send you three pieces of jewelry based on your style every month, and you can choose the one you really, really love to buy at a discount. Well, we better sign up. We don't have that much time. Done. Easy. But the hard part, getting the answers to Seychelle's questions. [CHRIS SIGHS] Twenty-one! Yes, that's what I'm talking about, baby. Chris, what's up? We're supposed to meet at the restaurant. Yeah, but I just won $500. You gonna hook me up? I knew you was going to ask. -I do need a favor, though. -What's up? -Remember that solar job? -Yeah. You still got that uniform? Why? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hello, ma'am. We're giving away free solar panels today. I'm not interested. Oh. Filipino? Uh, yes. [SPEAKS TAGALOG] You're very... [SPEAKS TAGALOG] Wow. -You know Tagalog? -[SPEAKS TAGALOG] This is 100% free. Libre. No kidding. Are you sure I don't have to pay anything? Yes, Absolutely free. We're doing this all in the spirit of love. Wow. I like that. All you have to do is answer a few questions, and voila! -$25,000 solar panels, free. -Okay. So, um, do you have any kids? Yes. Three. And who's the oldest? Hillary. Is your daughter in love? What kind of questions are these? Are you trying to court my daughter? No, tita, I'm just going through the questions here. Okay. Well, yes, she's in love, I guess. What was your first impression of her boyfriend? Uh... Warm, very nice. And a good boy. And what was the most difficult problem you both had and how did you get through it? What kind of questions are these? Sorry, tita, we're almost done. Just two more questions, and then you have free power for life. Don't you want that? Yes, of course. Electricity is very expensive. Um, what was the question again? What was the most difficult problem you both had, and how did you get through it? Oh. We don't really have a problem. But I have a problem with him not having a job. And not marrying my daughter yet. And, you know, not having any money. And how did you get through it? To be honest, we're not through it. He's still a loser. Okay. Noted here. All right. Time for the last question. Why do you think your daughter loves him? Um... I think she loves him because... I don't know. He's just a broke loser. Perhaps there's something there. Come on, tita. Uh... I think she love him because he's loyal. He always remained true to her. Thank you so much, tita. And that pretty much concludes our giveaway. I'll be right back with your solar panels. Wow. I can't believe I'm getting free solar! Wait. Where's my solar? Hey! What are you... You scammed me, huh? Oh, you scammer. You're a scammer! What would you say your first impression was when we first met? That was random, but I like it. I remember your sexy voice. Reporter voice. Hi. I'm Chris Soriano. Thank you for joining us live from Los Angeles. No, I did not sound like that. That's what I first remember. Okay. Well, since you got me in reporter mode, what would you say is the most challenging problem we went through? And how were you able to get through? Wow. These are great questions. You came prepared. Hey, what's that supposed to mean? You're usually on your phone. But I love these open-ended questions. So the most difficult problem was... that one time when I was super jealous of you and your coworker. She was so beautiful. And I just remember just seeing her and you and I know you were working, but I just felt so depressed, and it made me feel so ugly. I didn't want to be with you anymore. But I gained that confidence, and God gave me that confidence and you gave me that confidence, to remember that we are one, and it's just me and you and no one else. -I love you. -I love you most. I love you mostess. [GIGGLES SOFTLY] For my last question, why do you love me? I love you for so many reasons. The way you make me laugh, the way you hold me, the way we pray together, the way you take care of me. Well, that's gonna do it tonight. I'm Chris Soriano reporting at Panini Kabob Grill. And I'm Hillary Manalac. [CHUCKLES] -[CELL PHONE VIBRATES] -Oh. Hold on, one second. -Hello? -Chris. -Yeah? -I need those measurements ASAP. Or else this dress won't be made on time. Uh, I'll get it to you tomorrow. I need them by tonight. Oh, fine. I'll get it tonight. And don't get caught, because if she knows you're measuring her, she'll know why you're doing it. And then your surprise is ruined. HILLARY: Who was that? -Some lady. -Lady? Not that kind of lady. Some old crazy lady. [COMICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISPERS] Hey. Hey. -What are you doing? -I'm just cuddling. I know there's an airport nearby. [CHUCKLES] But if you're getting married, who cares? You'll be too drunk to notice. So, anyway, let's talk budget. What are you thinking? Well, my budget's pretty low. How low are we talking? What's your lowest package? [CHUCKLES] You first. Well, it really depends. I thought I'd treat you to lunch and we can talk about numbers. Sounds like a good plan. Oh, eating, a good plan. What a bright idea. [SIGHS] There's a lot of history on this property. Did you know three former presidents had receptions here? [SIGHS] We pride ourselves on being a historical landmark with American heritage baked into the venue. [SIGHS] So, let's talk budget. What are we thinking? Um, like I said, the budget's pretty low, but we really like the venue. I'm the type of guy who likes to tell it like it is. The total cost of this experience, venue, tables, chairs, food and wine, will cost you about $50,000. [SPITS, CLEARS THROAT] That's pretty high. I mean, do you think you could go a little lower? How low are we talking? 45,000? 42,000? More like 8,000. [LAUGHS] Oh, God. I guess the stereotypes of Asians are true. What's that? Y'all a bunch of cheap sons of bitches. [LAUGHS] Listen, we are not cheap. We are budget-conscious. There's a difference. Let's cut the bullshit. -Mm. -I see people like you all the time. You come onto my property, look around, pretend you're going to buy something. You're basically just taking advantage of me for free meals and alcohol. Excuse me? You heard me, Miss Chang, who doesn't know a "thang" about weddings. [LAUGHS] Hey, no need to be disrespectful like that. [SIGHS] This wine... Sangiovese. Vintage 2017, worth $30. But judging from the package sticker you left on there, you bought it wholesale. And you decided to serve it in a champagne glass, not a wine glass. Not sure who made that mistake. And let's talk about the linens here. It's not 100% cotton. It's polyester. So cheap, and it tatters on the edges. But that's not what's got me. It's the dried chicken breast. Hmm. Well, there's two things that guests will always remember and never forgive you for. Which is bad music and bad food. So, you charge $50,000 for this experience, but the overhead is 8K, so you net 42? There is one thing that I know, since you're generalizing Asians with stereotypes, is that we know when we're getting ripped off. And for a lack of better term, this place is sseulegi. What does that even mean? It's Korean for trash. Come on, let's go. Oh, God. Hey, baby, I'm home. Hey, baby. Hey. Where you heading? I'm going out. Okay. Where you going? Um, I'll be right back. It'll just be quick. It's a little late. [SIGHS] -How was your day? -It was good. How was yours? I said, how was yours? It's good. Good, good, good. Okay, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later, okay? Love you. Love you, too. -You look amazing. -HILLARY: Thank you. Do a little spin. Yeah, you look amazing. Honestly. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Hey, baby, I'm back. -Back from where? -From work. You swear? Yeah. Liar. You know what? I'm leaving. Leaving? Where? Remember, you messed this up. Not me. -I messed this up? How? -You know what you did. What did I do? I didn't do anything. I don't want to continue this relationship anymore, all right? I'm done. You're done? You know how many times I felt done during this pandemic? And I never quit this relationship. So you stop and think really hard about what you're doing. You want to know why I'm really leaving? It's because I'm not happy with you anymore. I'm not happy, too. You don't even pay attention to me anymore. The last time we made love was three months ago. All you do is come home late. You smell like wine. And I don't even ask where you've been. I just trust that you've been honest and faithful. Well, maybe that's our problem. Honesty. Maybe it is. I just don't want this anymore, Hill. Stop. Don't say that. Well, I mean it. I've been with you for 10 years. I gave you my heart and you throw it away. My mom was right. You're just a broke loser. [RING CLATTERS] -Yo. -Yo, man. Can I crash at your place? Is everything okay? Hillary and I broke up. Oh, damn. Come on in. So, what happened? She was kissing some other dude, man. Oh, damn. At this point, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. So what do you want to do now? I'm calling all this shit off. Damn! All that work for nothing? Are you gonna be all right? You can sleep on my couch for as long as you like. Thanks, man. Let me get you some covers. [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] -Hello? -SEYCHELLE: [OVER PHONE] Chris, quick, come here. It's 7:00 a.m. It's done, and it's ready for you to look at. What... Uh, um... Uh... Come here now, and bring my money. [SIGHS] Come here. Come here. Are you ready to see the dress? Yeah, sure. Wow. -It's so beautiful. -You like it? I love it. Everything okay? Hillary and I broke up. [GASPS] What? How come? She found someone else. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's okay. I spent so many hours making this dress. I wish I could take back time. You're still going to pay me, right? -Yeah. -Okay, good. Phew. So what are you going to do? I don't know. You better tell Christine. I will. If it means anything, I thought what you were planning was very sweet, and in all my years, I never met someone who has pulled off a surprise wedding. I'll save it for you in case you need it in the future. [SIGHS] Just get rid of it. What? It's so beautiful. Just donate it. Give it away. I don't want it. I'll save it for you. It's so expensive and pretty. Oi, don't forget to pay me half. [SPEAKS TAGALOG] He's never this late. Should I send him another message? Yeah. [CELL PHONE VIBRATES] Do you think he got COVID? Maybe, or something else. Okay. The next time he comes, tell him to bring a COVID test. -Should I get tested? -No, you're fine. Well, did you tell everyone you canceled yet? No. Well, you should at least let your Wedding Hustler friend know. She'll be all right. Don't you gotta pay her? [SIGHS] Yeah, I'll pay her. You need to let her know so she's not wasting her time. You got some sauce on you leg. Love you. At least somebody loves me. Everything okay? You bailed on us today. Hillary and I... Hillary and I broke up. Oh. What happened? She found someone else. Just like that? I saw her with another guy. And when she came home, we started arguing. And one thing led to another, and then we... We broke up. Gosh, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. I guess it's mine. It's been like that throughout the pandemic. [CHRISTINE SIGHS] -It's not your fault. -[SOBS] Don't blame yourself. You know what you need? Oh, this wine really is good. See? That's what I've been trying to tell you. I'm trying to tell you what's good for you, but you're Honest Abe over here, and that's it. That's your problem. What's my problem? No, I'm not telling you. -Tell me. Please. -No. No. You did this to me, so I'm doing it to you. -What? No. -I'm not telling you. Tell me. Come on. Please? Okay, fine. [SIGHS] I think I finally figured it out. Figured out what? Why you and your fiancee didn't work out. Well, your ex now. Why? You're just too honest, Chris, and people can't handle that. Well, you're too real. And sometimes people can't handle that. Hey, I just forgot my planner. Oh, my gosh. We're just going through planning stuff. We're just planning stuff. Yeah. Right. Hillary and Chris broke up. Wait, what? She cheated on me. What a bitch! Yeah, I know. Well, in that case, you guys hook up. No, no, no, no. We're not hooking up. Well, she's been single for far too long. This is strictly business. Mm-hmm. Monkey business. [LAUGHS] So what does it mean for the wedding? Isn't it pretty obvious? Am I still getting paid, though? -Oh, yeah. -Me, too? -Yep, Yep. -Okay, then we're good. Okay, Girl, you'll never guess what I almost saw. Oh, my God. What? Well, almost. Wait, what do you mean, "Almost"? They were about to kiss, and I walked in. No, grabe. What? I don't get paid enough to deal with this. And Chris is about to get married, and I have no idea what's going on. Well... Well, you know what? Love is love. Now, if they really love each other, they're gonna work it out. Okay. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] What the hell? Excuse me. Is Jay Fernandez here? Yeah, he's just right over there. Thanks. Hey, you Jay Fernandez? Excuse me? Were you with Hillary? -Who? -Hillary Manalac. Answer the question. Hillary. Oh. Hillary. [GRUNTS] That's for messing with my girl. [GROANS] Chris? You dumbass. Your girl came to me. -What? -Your fiancee hired me to throw you a surprise wedding. Now you ain't getting your money back. Hey, where you going? [GROANS] Get back here! [GROANS] Christine. Hillary didn't cheat on me. The wedding's back on. I need $5,000. You got any cash? I got a dollar. Anyways. I gotta plan this wedding. Good luck. Vern. So, Hillary never cheated on me. What? I know. It's a long story, but I need $5,000. -$5,000? -Yeah. Uh, I don't have it. But we can make it here. Follow me. All right. Let's start with my first strategy called "Never Bust." For Never Bust, you always hit 11 and under, never 12 and above. -You sure? -Yeah, I'm sure. It's called Never Bust. Just play $100. CROUPIER: All right. Good luck. Eighteen. Eleven. Twenty. Stay? -Sorry. -I thought you said I wasn't gonna bust. I did say you'll never bust. I just didn't say you'll win. It's all right. Martingale. You put down double to get what you lost back up. Just put down 20. [SIGHS SOFTLY] Seventeen. -Next time. -Stay. 15. Nineteen. Stay. Eighteen. It's okay. You can't lose three times in a row. Double down. I don't have enough to double down. You can go all in. So you can put 20 there and 20 on the buster. That 20 can actually get to 5,000. It's paid 250-1. I don't know, man. It's a huge risk. That's how much I need. [SIGHS] You never know, right? All right. Better luck. All right. Okay. Two, five. VERN: Okay. Soft 17. We have 13 right now. We're going for the big... The big buster. Thirteen. Fourteen. All right. Thirteen. Two, four, six, seven. -We need one more card for the bust, big bust. -[VERN EXCLAIMS] Ready? Yes, I did it! We won. This is the one time you're supposed to bust. Sorry. Better luck. There's something in that boba. Man, I knew this wasn't gonna work. My marriage is over. I'm gonna end up like this guy. [PULLS LEVER] Okay. Okay. Uh... Oh, dude. Well, at least you didn't waste your time on the slots. That's a loser's game. Well, here's to a loser like me. [MACHINE RINGS] Oh, my God, we won! -You did it. You did it. -We won. Oh, my God! -We won, bro. -You did it. You did it. You got the money you need. -We won! -You did it! -VERN: [LAUGHS] Yes, yes! We did it. -Oh, my God! Vern, we did it. Oh, my... -Chris. -Hey, Uncle. I thought you would grow a bobo by now. I can't grow a beard, Uncle. That's okay. Hi, Chris. Hey, Auntie. May I come in? It's late. I'm tired. I'll just be quick. Come on in. If you need anything, I'm going to be upstairs watching YouTube. [SIGHS] What do you want, Chris? I don't know how to say this. Eh, enough of this. When are you going to marry my daughter? When are you going to stand up and be a man? Time to commit. I am, Auntie. When? Next year? Another year? You know, you're lucky. When I was young, if a man wanted to court me, he would have to ask approval of my dad. And if he didn't keep his promise, you know what he would do? He would pull out his shotgun. Be a man, not a coward. I'm tired of you disrespecting me and always putting me down. From the first day I met you, you've always been bringing me down. I get it. You don't like me, and I can't change that. But the reason why I came here was to ask for your approval. I've been planning a surprise wedding for your daughter. And I just wanted you to be there. And just like you told me when you first came to this country and you had nothing, and that first bite of chocolate was everything... Well, Hillary's my everything. And I just want you to be there. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [CLEARS THROAT] I just want to thank everyone for being here and making this surprise happen. -MAN: Yeah! -[APPLAUSE] MAN: Go, Chris. It's going to be a big day, and anything could throw this surprise off. But I just pray it all works out. It will, bro. We got your back. Thanks, man. Great. Can we eat? I'm hungry. -[ALL LAUGH] -All right, Let's eat. [CAMERA CLICKS] Oh. You can go upstairs. Hey. -It's the bridal room. -Got it. [GASPS] Ooh, arrived on time. -What's this? -Your wedding band. Wow. Come with me. What are you doing? Pay attention. Do you need any help? [MICROWAVE DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [MICROWAVE RUNNING] No. Marriage isn't just one day. It's a lifetime. And I know you're working really hard to plan this all by yourself, but none of that matters as much as the rest of your lives together. [MICROWAVE BEEPS] [MICROWAVE DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Preserve the love. Never let it die. Where'd you learn how to do this? The QR code on the box. Oh. Leaving already? Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. -Take it easy now. -Thanks. [SNIFFLES] Is that for me? CHRIS: I know I've been a jerk. And if you give me another chance, I can explain why. Sincerely, the man who loves you the mostess. [SNIFFLES] This is from Chris? [CRIES] If you reach for that side pocket there, Miss Manalac, there's another note for you. CHRIS: They say if you could survive in the most challenging times, you'll surely thrive when times get better. And this pandemic really showed me a beautiful side of you I never knew. I learned your favorite flower was lavender, and I wanted you to experience what a field of lavender feels like. -Oh. -That's how much I love you. Okay, let's go. Oh. I have one more note for you, Miss Manalac. Thank you. CHRIS: I learned that if something is really important enough in your life, you'll do anything, anything to make it work. And so I ask you to take one more leap of faith with me. This time, it's for real. [CAR DOOR OPENS] [HILLARY EXCLAIMS] So beautiful! [GASPING] Oh, my gosh. This is gorgeous. [EXCLAIMS] Wow. Holy shit! [GASPS] Thank you. [EXCLAIMS] CHRIS: If you don't like it, we could always return it. And that's hella Filipino. And what good is a nice dress without the bling to go with it? As soon as you're done, hop back in the car. There's one more place I want you to see. One more? [EXCLAIMS] [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [MOUTHING] Come on. Come on, come on, come on. We're late. We're late. It a surprise, Mom. We're already late. Surprise, surprise. Why did he choose to surprise in the middle of the workweek? Am I dressed okay? Should I have grown my beard? No, Dad. Your bobo's fine. -[SCREAMS] -No, no. Your shoes. Come on, put your shoes on. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join Chris and Hillary in the celebration of holy matrimony. -Okay. Let's go. -Okay. Ready. Where's Vanessa? BOTH: Vanessa! [BOTH PANTING] -Oh. Okay. -Okay, let's go. -Ready. -Where's the directions? Oh, okay, uh, it's 57... Put it in your phone. 574... Where's my phone? Got it. -Okay. -I need to pee. Now, Chris, you may kiss the bride. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] -Let's go. -Okay, let's go. -Lola! -ALL: Lola! -Where is everybody? -We're late. They're probably at the reception. To the reception. [VANESSA SCREAMS] ...the wedding, and, you know, I love you. I love you most. -Love you mostess. -[CHUCKLES] Anak! Mom! -[SCREAMS] You look so beautiful! -Oh, my God! -My God, this is a pirate ship. -Be careful. Oh, I'm so happy you're here. Of course. It's the most important day of my life. CHRIS: Thank you for everything, Auntie. From now on, no more Auntie. I am proud to call you my son. -Mom! -Thank you. Okay. Come on. Let's go party-party. [GIGGLING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL CHEERING] HILLARY: Thank you. Congratulations. I've heard so much about you. Oh, thank you so much. I've heard so much about you. You're the Wedding Hustler. Oh. And officially, today, you're Hillary Soriano. And so I got you a little gift. [GASPS] Thank you. Wow. Amazing! Well, I know changing your last name can be stressful. -So this is going to do everything for you. -Thanks so much. This is what I need. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. Thank you so much. [MOUTHING] Wow. CHRIS: I guess that's it. Well, when one thing ends, another beautiful one begins. Thank you. [SIGHS] You did it. Congrats. Now go live your life. This just can't be it. You got married on a good budget. What more can we ask for? I guess I could take a job. A job? Yeah, I'm unemployed. And I could help you hustle. Are you sure you want to work with me? Yeah. I mean, there's so many people we could help. I mean, I did everything you taught me. Okay. How about you go on your honeymoon first? We'll talk about it when you're back. Sounds good. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Shots, shots? -Honey, go get the drinks, I'll go get a table. -Okay. Eight, please. Excuse me. Do I know you? -Who, me? -Yeah. I have never met you in my life. No, thank you. Thank you. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] Where'd you get the limo driver? -Why? -He looks like a stripper. He is. [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] What? Why? -He's cheaper. -[CHUCKLES] HILLARY: Wow. This is so beautiful. CHRIS: I know, right? [SIGHS] And I have a surprise for you. What? A surprise! -Yes. -This is already so perfect. I know. But marriage isn't just a day. It's a lifetime. And we gotta to always make sure to preserve the love. -I decided to preserve your bouquet... -[GASPS] ...as a symbolism of my love, so it'll last forever. This is so beautiful. I love it. I'll make sure to preserve our love and keep it alive forever. -Thanks, man. -No worries. Cheers. -May we join you guys? -CHRIS AND HILLARY: Sure. -Thanks. -What are you two celebrating? We just got married. Wow. Congratulations. Thank you. What can I say? I'm a lucky guy. But what about you two? What are you celebrating? We just got engaged yesterday. -What? That's crazy. -Oh, congrats. -Thank you. -Thanks. Uh, do you happen to know of a good wedding planner? Actually, I do. But first I gotta ask... What's your budget? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING]
