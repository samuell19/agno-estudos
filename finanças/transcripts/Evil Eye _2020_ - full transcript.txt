My darling. No. Don't come near me. I'm asking you nicely. Come with me! Stop fighting me! Hello. Hello? Are you asleep? It's 7:00 in the morning, Ma. Fine. I'll call you later. No, it's okay. What's up? Shobha Aunty just called. Abhishek got engaged. Mm-hmm. Did you hear what I said? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Your youngest cousin just got engaged. You're the only one left. Oh, what a shame. I should never have left America. I should have only come back to India after finding you a husband. - Uh-huh. - What "uh-huh"? Just let me be, Ma. I'm okay. I'm not cursed. I keep telling you. How can you say that? You're turning 29 soon. Yeah, last year of my 20s. No. You know what your horoscope says. If you're not married by 29, then you won't be married at all. Won't get married at all... What a tragedy. Tell Pallavi what you think. Astrology is unscientific nonsense. Love you. You're both gonna torture me to death. A good marriage doesn't happen just like that. You have to take this seriously, okay, Pallu? If you're not careful... ...bad things could happen. Ma, why do you always assume the worst? Ma? Hello? I'm your mother, no? That's my job. Are you wearing your bracelet? Yes, I am wearing it. Good. It will protect you from the evil eye, darling. Good. I love it. Can I go back to sleep now? Yes, yes. Sorry. Take rest. Okay, sure. - Talk to you soon. - Bye. I can't believe you're gonna be a mom. I feel like one already. I'm so in love with this little goblin. I'd do anything for her. Can I help with anything, Malik? - Nah, I got it. - Good, - 'cause I don't know how to make chai. - Oh. It's like she heard me articulate my failings as - an Indian woman. - You want me to teach you how to make chai? - Hi, Ma. - Hello, darling. What's that music? Oh, you wouldn't know it. I like it. Look who I'm with. Hello, Kelly. You look so beautiful. Aw, thanks, Mrs. Khatri. Where's Malik? Oh, he's in the kitchen making chai. - Hi, Mrs. Khatri. - Sweet boy. Even Pallavi doesn't know how to make tea. What's up, Ma? So, Pallu, okay, I wanted to... No. I'm not meeting another boy. That is not why I called. Uh-huh. Sure. Well, since I've got you on the phone... Look, darling. He looks handsome, no? Oh, yeah, he's very professional. See? Kelly also likes him. He lives in Houston, but he's going to New Orleans this weekend, and he said he could meet you. Wait, you've already arranged this? We have to move fast. He doesn't even live here. There are no Indians in New Orleans. - What am I supposed to do? - Ma. Okay, we talked about this. I can't do these setups anymore. I'm not saying marry him. I'm just saying go for coffee. What are we saying? I'm trying to talk to your daughter. What is she saying? Oh, trying to find Pallavi a man who can make chai. Amma, these things never work out. But what if it does this time and then you say no without even trying? How's the chai? It's not too hot, is it? Fine. The things I do for you. So, what'd your mom say about this one? Engineer... - Mm-hmm. - ...hikes on the weekends... - Mm. - ...likes music. - Likes music? - Mm-hmm. Oh. Okay. - Is he in there? - Oh, yeah. How bad is it? - Oh, shit. - Great. He's hot. What? - That's not him. - Mm. It should be. It could be. Hey, just... go with it. Honest mistake. All brown dudes look alike. Right? Oh, come on. Hey. Have we met? Wow. Use that line a lot? Uh, sorry. Uh... you are waiting on a setup, aren't you? What? You've been looking out the window for a while now, waiting for someone. But if it was a regular date, you might have bailed by now. So I'm guessing you probably have to report back to your parents, so you're sticking around. Is that right? God, setups are the absolute worst, aren't they? Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I didn't mean to... - No. Yeah. - Sorry. Yeah. Take care. Well, I mean... ...he's not here yet. No, he's not. I'm Sandeep. Pallavi. Beautiful name. Thank you. Hey, sorry. Was there an Indian girl waiting here? Oh, yeah. Uh, she left a few minutes ago. He was over an hour late, Ma. Of course I left. Just like that? Where are you now? - With Sonia. - You can see Sonia anytime. How can you do this, Pallu? He's a decent boy from a good family. I didn't even want to meet him in the first place. It doesn't matter. How does it not matter? 'Cause we are doing this for your happiness, for your future. When your commander says drop to the ground, you drop to the ground. Ma, this is not the army. You are not my commander. I don't have to blindly obey you. I'm asking you to trust me. Why can't you just... Why can't I meet someone on my own? Ma? Hello? - Hello? - Yes. Yes. Of course you can meet someone yourself. I just don't want you to... fall in love with the wrong man. You want me to trust you, but you don't trust me at all, do you? - Pallavi... - I'll talk to you later, okay? You okay? Yeah. My mom... she's a bit much. Sorry. This was us at a wedding a few years back in Edison. Before my parents moved back to Delhi. My dad got this great university gig, and it just made sense for them to go back home. Must be hard, being so far away. I don't see my parents much, either. Listen, um, this was really fun, but I got to... Have another setup to get to? Yeah, who knows? Maybe that guy's still waiting for me at the coffee shop. Can I see you again? Maybe. You go ahead. Almost one month now, you've been having these migraines. So... so, please, let me stay and help you. No. If I'm alone, It passes. Are you sure? It's okay. Go. Go, go. I'll be fine. I'm getting worried. What am I supposed to say to everyone? I'll bring some sweets. Can you believe it? They met over Skype a month ago, and the wedding got decided then and there. Ugh. I don't understand. You know, these youngsters so modern. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Arre, woman, today's my cheat day. Hey, where's Usha? Huh? I've been looking for her all day. She fell ill just before we were coming, and so she'll visit the family another time. Oh. Is she still obsessed with the evil eye? - Yeah. - Pallavi's not cursed. That's silly. Oh, take her to see a doctor, nah? Take her to see my doctor. He prescribes everything. - She'll be fine. - Mm. Oh. I say don't take anything, you take a whole plate. - I will die tomorrow. - Excuse me. - Let me eat today. - Is it opposite day? Let me eat today. I'll die tomorrow. - Oh, today? Today? - I'll die tomorrow. Come on. Hello? Hi, Ma. - You okay? - Yes. Yes, of course. - Wait, did I just wake you up? - No, no. I was just lying down. Ma, isn't it Abhishek's engagement tonight? Are you that upset that you skipped the engagement? Anyway, um... I've met someone. You met someone? What does that mean? Do you have a boyfriend? Well, we've been seeing each other for three or four weeks now. Do you like him? I wouldn't tell you about him if I didn't like him. What's his name? Okay, don't get too excited. His name is Sandeep Patel. What, Indian? A Gujarati? Those Patel types are very rich. - Please don't say things like that. - How old is he? - What does he do? - He's my age. He works in tech. He's very successful. Pallu, this is such good news. - Really? - Yes. I've been praying for a good man for you. He's a good man, yes? - Yeah, I mean, sure. - Sure? You have to be positive. You have to know what kind of person he is. Send me his parents' info. - I'll talk to them. - Jesus, Ma. Slow down. He's great. He's been nothing but good to me. Anybody can be nice at the beginning. Ma... Well, it's-it's good. We're good. Why can't you just trust me? I'm sorry, Pallu, okay? But send me a photo of him, no? Okay, check your messages. - Yes. - Love you. I love you. Feeling better? Pallu has a boyfriend. Huh. That's it? Now you can stop worrying about her. Brought laddus. How many? Mm... Okay. - Eight. - Eight. Respectable. I want to be respected. And you? - Tell me. - Ooh... hmm. - Oh, God. - Uh, mm... Oh, come on. I showed you mine. Two? Really? I'm a long-term relationship kind of guy. - Mm-hmm. - What? Well, it's just that... I've, um, I've googled you. You do that a lot? Google people? The people that I'm sleeping with? Uh, yeah. I'm a woman in the 21st century. Mm. I'm just saying, it-it looks like you, um, ran with a hard-partying crew in New York. And that's a crime now? I'm not accusing you of anything. - Oh. Yeah. - It's just, um... Was one of them Miss India? First runner-up. - Okay. - She wanted to get married. That's crazy. You were almost engaged to almost Miss India. What happened? It's complicated. Like, how? It wasn't a good relationship. Oh. She cheated on you. No, it just didn't work out. Did she just want you for your money or... No. - There were issues. - Like what? What's that mean? Like she tried to kill herself when I broke up with her. Shit. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... - It's okay. She wasn't who I thought she was. Guess it's hard to really know someone, right? If you want to know anything about me, just ask. I'll tell you everything. I like you. I'll never lie to you or BS you. I promise. Promise you'll do the same? Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. He's rich, he's cute, and he's good with babies? No wonder we've hardly seen you this last month. Is your mom happy? - I thought she was at first. - Mm. But she's been asking me these weird questions, like she's worried. Like he's too good to be true. Well, I'll take him if you don't want him. Oh. That's so sweet. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind, thank you. Well, we're happy for you. I didn't even think you believed in love, and now look at you. Oh, I don't know about love. Please. You are smitten. - Bye, guys. - Hey, we had so much fun. Thanks for coming. - Bye. - Bye. Take care. Talk to you later. Happy month-iversary. - Yeah. - Yeah. We should celebrate, huh? Yeah. I got you something. Oh. No, I didn't mean that... They're sapphire. I saw them and thought of you. Um, this is too much. Come on, this is nothing. - Just try them on. - Oh, no. I can't. I can't. They're really nice. I j... I can't accept these. Thank you. Okay. Hey. I just, I just wanted to do something nice. Yeah, you did. You came to this party with me. You met my friends. That means a lot to me. Is this about your ex? She would... get upset if I didn't show her appreciation. I sometimes wonder if that's why she... No. No, I am not... I'm not like that. The earrings are beautiful. It's just... but... Save them for our engagement. - I'm... - Uh... - I'm joking. - Okay. Yeah. I'll save 'em. - Yeah. Okay. - Yeah. Okay. What the hell is this? Uh, Usha! Uh, this, th-this thing is, uh... The-the... Usha! Usha, I'm having a bit of a problem with the... I'm having some trouble with the dal. Can you come look? You don't want to eat tonight or what? That's it! I'm ordering pizza! Hello, Pallu? Sandeep wants you and Papa to Skype with his parents. Wait, Pallu, what did you say? Sandeep wants you and Papa to Skype with his parents. Already? He tried to give me jewelry. Can you believe that? Jewelry? It was sweet, but I gave it back, of course. Are you okay? You sound... weird. Yes. Uh, yes, of course. So, he wants to proceed so quickly? He's more Indian than I realized. Almost like you found him for me. That's all very... That's very good. Darling, can I just say, don't move in with him until you are married. - Okay? - Ma, come on. I'm just asking this one thing. It's like, I'm old-fashioned. Please. I'll think about it. I have to set up for class. Thank you. I love you very much. I love you, too. She's spending all her time with him. He got her jewelry. It's too much. It's too soon. You only are too much. What? Now that there's nothing to worry about, you have to invent something new to worry about. Am I right? What time is it? It's 1:00. Go to sleep. Hmm. Hey, did you know your hot water is out? Yeah, it comes in and out. - What? - It's not that big of a deal. I just shower at the gym when I have to. Dinner's ready. Sit. I apologize in advance. You'll have to eat around the burnt bits. Or we could just go out. After I slaved all day over this stove for my man? No. You have to try it. Give it a taste. "When your commander says "drop to the ground... ...you drop to the ground." Wait, do you know that expression? Uh, it's from the story of that Indian army commander, right? That's my grandfather. Wow. Really? My nanaji. Uh, he used to say that to my mom, to get her to listen to him. Supposedly, he saved a lot of people that day. That's amazing. No one's ever said it back to me before. Move in with me. What? You deserve better than this place. I can't. I can't. My parents. Okay, then... then let me help you with an apartment. Sandeep, no, you are not helping me with an apartment. Pallavi, I... Don't worry about the money. If I got you an apartment, what would that do for your life? And no lies. You promised. I would write. Let me help you. Please. - Well, I have a job and... - So? Quit. - It can wait. - No. That's your friends talking. I can afford it. Ah, here we go. - Aw. - Ah. Beautiful. And... Make a wish. Ah! But your biggest wish has already come true, hasn't it, Usha? - Pallavi's found a boy. - Arre, Usha. Why didn't you tell us? Ow! Did you burn yourself? - Are-are you okay? - No, no, no. - Did you burn yourself? Usha... Put it in cold water. - No, no. - Yeah, yeah. - I'll get this. I'll get this. - You all right? - Yeah. I'm gonna go inside. Let's-let's stay out a little bit more, no? It's such a nice evening. You enjoy the nice evening, and... I just need to go. Usha, try, please. - It's okay. - Please. I can't get her to stay outside. Let us talk to her. Come. All right, who wants cake? - Come on. - Big, uh, big slice. Today's my cheat day. No, y-you have been saying no to so many things lately. Come on, we've barely seen you in the last, what, two months. Usha, are you sure his parents are Nidhi and Rajdeep Patel? That's what Pallavi said. Arre, those Patels? My dear, these people own half the motels in America. They're filthy rich. And this boy has gone for Pallavi? Oh, Pallavi should marry him fast before they send a private detective to come in and look after her. - What detective? Don't be silly. - Good idea. No. I'm not being silly. Hello. I'm not being silly, nah? I'm telling you, it's all the rage with these richie-rich South Delhi families. Happy birthday, Ma. Hi, Pallu. How's the party? It's good, but I wish you were here, too. So do I. Um, I have exciting news. - Oh. - I moved. - What? - To a much nicer apartment. But you always said you couldn't afford to move. Sandeep is helping out with the rent. Actually with the move, too. We hired actual movers like actual adults. Pallavi... I know. This thousand a month is like a drop in the bucket to him. One thousand? He's being supportive. Ma, isn't that what you want for me? Darling, can you give me his date of birth and his time and place of birth? - No. - What? - Why? - You're not checking our horoscopes to see if we're compatible. You know I don't believe in that stuff. You don't have to believe in it. I'll believe in it for you. He'll know exactly why I'm asking. It's embarrassing, Ma. He's understanding, no? He seems very understanding. This is just for me. I'm not going to tell you what I learn. Come, darling, please. Fine, I'll send it. Usha, darling? Everything all right? Ma? - Hello? - Is that your mom? - Yeah. - Can I...? Oh. Hey, Ma, um, Sandeep wants to... I have to go. Hello? Ma? Huh. Usha, everything okay? I'm fine. I'll be right out. Thank you for coming so quickly, Guruji. Oh, well, for you, madam, of course. How many boys have we seen for Pallavi so far? - 100? 200? - Not that much. But this one, madam, this one is, uh... - I'm glad you called me. - Oh, God. I knew it. I-I knew it. I have never seen such perfect compatibility between two souls. What? This is a ten-out-of-ten match for Pallavi. Wonderful. Wonderful. Tell me, tell me about the boy. Sandeep. Tell me what's in this chart. Everything seems to be proper. He was born under the Bharani star. Very auspicious. - Bharani star. - Mm-hmm. He's a powerful man. Yes, very powerful, very rich. I would have the wedding as soon as possible. Tell me about his character. Character? Uh, for that, we have to look at his yoga, madam... uh, his house. This young man is born under the Gajakesari yoga. But not to worry... His character is very strong. Very strong. He will get whatever he desires. Madam? Madam? - Madam, are you okay? - Is she safe? - Pallavi? - Safe? O-Okay. So, I keep sending her... no? The necklaces, the bracelets. - She keeps forgetting to wear them. - Mm-hmm. She's not protecting herself. The evil eye. Yes. She should listen to you, madam. Uh, the horoscope says everything is good. Uh, but if you want, we can do another puja for you, just to set your mind at ease, huh? Uh, only 5,000 rupees. Part of the writing process? Yeah. What if it is? Hello? What are you doing online, Ma? Isn't it, like, 3:00 a.m. in Delhi? I'll go to sleep soon. Are you at work? No, I'm home. Trying to work on my novel. I'm so glad you're writing again, Pallavi. I know. About time I use that writing degree for writing instead of babysitting undergrads. So, you're not going to work today? Or later? Well, actually, Ma, I quit. What? Yeah, it was sucking up all my time and energy. And, um, now I have time to actually write. Whose idea was this? Sandeep? Amma, I wish you would just start with being happy for me. - How are you going to live? - That's the thing. I don't have to worry about that anymore. You are not married yet. This is irresponsible. Would it make a difference if it were you and Papa who were supporting me as I wrote my novel? Even if we could, we would expect you to work. You can't just give up your independence like that. Pallavi? Now you care about my independence? What? I... Because you never seemed to care before. Never seemed to care that I was independent this whole time. What are you talking about? All I'm saying is that this is moving too fast, no? Too fast? Too fast? Why do you think this is happening so fast? What do you think our relationship has been? You and me. - Pallavi... - Wait, Ma. This whole time, all these years, even when I was taking care of myself and paying my bills, you made me feel like I wasn't a good daughter. All because I was single. And now I'm with someone that I am finally serious about, and you're still not happy. I'm still not doing it right. Do you know how big of a failure you make me feel like every single day? Do you love him? Everything all right? That's all I'm saying. If you don't... And now you care about love, Ma? - You're such a hypocrite. - Don't be hurtful. No. I don't know why I cared so much about what you thought all these years. Hey. - She drives me crazy. - Oh, come here. Come here. Ignore it. You can call her tomorrow. Not only that, he spent his childhood in boarding school. When he was 13, his parents sent him away because, the same year, there was a sealed court case, which we can't get access to, but clearly, something terrible happened. Then he gets older and drops out of college. Most importantly, his ex-girlfriends... They don't want to talk about him. Something's wrong. How did you find all this out? I hired a private detective. What? Yeah, I found him on the Internet. How-how much did it cost? I'm trying to protect your daughter. How much? Does it matter how much it costs?! What you have done... ...is disgraceful. This is a huge violation of privacy. What if someone investigated us, huh? Asked questions about our lives? How-how we fled to America after Pallavi was born. My God. If his parents ever find out... His parents... They know exactly who he is. A-And who is he? Have you not listened to a word I said? Think about it. Who else do you know who went to boarding school? Who else had too much wealth, too much power? Who else destroyed his girlfriends and they can't even talk about him? Does that remind you of someone? These are all superficial similarities. - Mm. - It does not mean Sandeep is anything like that man. I have spoken to him on the phone already. - He's a nice boy. - I know. They all said he was nice. My friends were like, "So nice." My parents, "So nice." Usha, please listen. What happened to you will not happen to our daughter. She won't let anyone take advantage of her. She's not like that. You've taught her not to be like that. You're right. She's not like me. So just drop it. Please, please drop it. I just have to warn her. Usha, don't you dare. She listens to you. Your opinion is everything to her. She doesn't care about what I think. Doesn't care? Yes, that's-that's why she talks to you every day, no? Because she doesn't care? Can-can you hear yourself? She's cursed. That man on the bridge cast an evil eye when she was inside me, and she's suffering for it, and I have to save her. This is madness. Can we... Can we please go to a doctor? This is paranoia, Usha. This is... It's delusional. Pa, what's up? Hello, Pallu. Did I, did I, did I... did I wake you, darling? No. No, I'm awake. Not a problem. - What's up? - I'm calling about your mother. I know what you're gonna say, but, honestly, she started it. No, no, no. She's not well, Pallu. Not well? She-She's been having migraines. Bad ones. She's... been... very anxious, you know? She's not leaving the house. She's not... So, if-if she says something to you, Pallu, just remember, don't take it to heart, okay? She's-she's... she's just going through something, you know? Papa? What's going on? You have me worried. Okay. Pallu, uh... ...b-before your mother and I got married, you know, a few years before that, you know, she had been in a relationship, this one boy that she had met in her college, and, um... And? It was, it was a very... bad relationship, darling. How bad? He-he was sort-sort of dangerous. D-Didn't like to be rejected, you know, and he... So your-your mother, you know, she had to escape from him, sort of. Shit. Shit, Papa. Why didn't you ever tell me about it? Uh, why tell you about all this, you know? It's just... you know, it's just some boy that she... Um, you know, I'm just... It's n-no big deal. I'm just telling you now so that you can understand. Understand what? What? Is-is he coming back to bother her? No, no, no, darling. He's dead. He died after Amma and I got married, just-just before you were born. Papa, what did he do to her? No, it... I-I don't know all the details, darling. But, um... You know, she-she never really recovered after that. Mentally. Emotionally. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Poor Amma. I mean, no wonder. Yeah, so... God. It makes so much more sense now. But, Papa... why-why is she worried about Sandeep? She doesn't think all men are like that, does she? You want some coffee? I-Is that Sandeep? Yeah. He just came by, just now. Oh, he just, he just came by, huh? He just happened to pop in? Darling, what do you take me for? You're young, you're American. We didn't raise a nun, you know. Come on. Okay, stop talk... Can we stop talking about it? Hey, can I, can I speak with him? Oh, sure. Yeah. Um, one second. It's my dad. - I'll make us coffee. - Okay. Hello, Uncle. Hello, my boy. How are you? I'm just great, Uncle. Actually, I'm glad you called. My parents are on board as well. I'm gonna propose to her. Wonderful. V-Very happy for you both. - Thank you, Uncle. - Um, a-actually, uh, you know, Usha has been very keen to speak with you. Now is a good time? Of course. Sandeep is on the phone. No, no, he asked for you. - No, he asked for you. - I'm in a towel. Usha, he will mistake us if you don't talk to him. He can't see you. Just take the phone, darling. Hello? Sandeep? Sandeep? Hello? Yes. Hello, Aunty. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm doing well. It's good to hear your voice. Oh? Pallavi talks about you all the time. Oh. Yes. Well, she talks about you, too, obviously. I-I'm just a little busy right now, so... Yes, of course. I'll let you go. I'm glad we connected. Feels like it was meant to be, doesn't it? Wh-What does? Our relationship. Me and Pallavi, of course. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I believe in fate. I think we have that in common, don't we, you and I? Yes. I-I want to thank you for Pallavi's apartment. Her writing, you know... It's always been her dream, and it's just too generous of you. Think nothing of it, Aunty. Everything I do is only for her own good. Hello? Aunty? Hello? All right, goodbye, Sandeep. I have to go. Bye-bye. What? What-what are you doing? Usha? Usha, what... what's going on, darling? Usha? Usha? Where is this wom... Usha? Usha, are you here, darling? Usha?! Hello, Krishnan. What is wrong? Oh, Radhika, s-so sorry to wake you, darling. Did-did Usha call you? Sh-She's, she's not here, and, uh, she left her phone behind. Oh, she hasn't left the house in two months. Why would she leave now? Where would she go? Usha? What's going on? I just needed to ask him some questions. Ask who? He's dead. He's been dead and gone for 30 years. I'm not so sure. So that big public inquest, that-that funeral that dominated the papers, that... All-all of that didn't happen? No, I think he died. I just don't think he ever went away. Okay, now, let's, uh... let-let's go home. - Okay? Come on. - You were right. About what? Pallavi. She's not like me. She's so smart. She's so independent. So, why is this pattern repeating itself? There is only one answer. He has come back as Sandeep. He is Sandeep. Sandeep is him. - What are you saying? - Sandeep told me on the phone that everything he does is for Pallavi's own good. That's what he would say to me every time. "It's all for your own good." It means nothing. Last night, you know what I did? I looked at Sandeep's birthday on the star charts. It was right there. Sandeep was born nine months after Pallavi was born. Nine months after that man fell from this bridge. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. We're... we're going to get you some help, darling. Let's... let's just go home now, okay? Come on. You think I'm crazy. No, I-I think that this is my fault. How is this your fault? We should never have come back to Delhi. My career is not worth this. We can leave tomorrow if we must. Oh, yeah, let's... No, no, I'm serious. Get away from this city, all of these bad memories. It's-it's not good for you. It's not the bad memories. It's karma. We cannot escape our karma. If we ran to the ends of the earth, he'd follow us. To finish what he started. Come. Hi, Mom. Hello. Are you asleep? No, I'm awake. I'm at Sandeep's. I'm sorry we haven't talked in a few days. That's okay. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Are you sure? You know you can tell me anything. Yes. You know that goes for you, too, right? What? Papa told me about the boyfriend you had before you were married. What did Papa say? You were in an abusive relationship. Weren't you, Ma? Your boyfriend hurt you? Yes. Oh, Ma. Oh. You don't know how much that breaks my heart. This is why we never told you. Why burden you with all this? Burden me? It's not a burden. I want to know everything about you. You still know me. Pallu, nothing has changed, no? This changes everything. What? How? Your... Your obsession with me finding the perfect husband... It's because you don't want me to go through what you did. Well, yes. Of course. It's so clear. I found Sandeep on my own without you. You're terrified but for no reason. Sandeep has been nothing but good to me. Good. Yes. Everything he does is only for your own good, he said. Why can't you just be happy for me? Please. I don't want to lose you. - Lose me? - Yes. So, if I don't approve of Sandeep, you'll choose him over me? Ma... we're engaged. He proposed last night. Why are you making this so fucking painful for no fucking reason? I want you to leave him. - What? - In fact, I insist. I order you, as your mother, if you have any love for me at all. Amma... Amma, stop this. I know you're going through something, but you cannot take it out on me when I have done nothing. When Sandeep has done nothing. I hired a private investigator. - What? - You know that there was a sealed cold case from when he was 13? You cannot do things like this. Like, what is he hiding? Oh, my God. He's not hiding anything. He broke some guy's car window when they were fighting about a girl or something. He was young and stupid. His parents sealed the case. He told me everything. Are you happy? So, he has a temper? You're exaggerating. Why was he forced out of his first college? He wasn't forced out. He dropped out. He wanted to start a new business. And then this string of girlfriends. Like, the private investigator talked to at least five of them. None of them had anything good to say about him. In fact, they don't want to talk about him at all. You sound like a crazy person. Crazy? Fuck, Ma, I'm sorry. I didn't, I didn't mean it like that. What do your friends think about him, hmm? Like, what does Sonia and Kelly think about him? They love him. And what do they think about him paying your rent and about you quitting your job? You never told them. What does it matter? We're getting married. It matters because you just keep making excuses for him, for you! I'm asking you to obey me, trust me. I'm telling you to drop to the ground. Ma, you need help. I'm trying to save your life, Pallu! What? Amma. Amma. You can't say that and stop talking. I'm... Mom? Hello? Are you there? Ma, are you there? Hello? Ma, are you there? Do you know the scar on my forehead? Yes. He gave it to me. That man, my boyfriend. You said that you got that in a car accident before I was born. No. He slammed my head onto a concrete barrier. I was working as a teacher in Delhi. I was happy, and for the first time in a long time, I was hopeful for the future. I thought I was rid of him. Your papa and I had been married for two years. When that man found out that I had moved on, he started calling, following me. He made sure I knew he was there. I would spot his car everywhere. Whenever I left work, he'd be waiting for me. I kept hoping he would move on. I didn't tell your father how bad it was. I started taking shortcuts, detours, deviations... Anything I could do just to throw him off... But he... he refused to give up. When it happened, I was eight months pregnant with you. His car followed me to the Yamuna Bridge. My darling. No. Don't come near me. I'm asking you nicely. Come with me! Stop fighting me! At that moment, I knew he was going to kill me. More than that, I knew he was going to kill you. I don't know how I did it. I overpowered him and pushed him off that bridge. The water was filthy, and he didn't know how to swim. After that, I ran. Thankfully, a rickshaw wallah stopped and he drove me to the nearest hospital. I didn't even know I was going into labor. You were a miracle baby. You were born early but healthy. The police never charged anyone for his death. Amma... are you... are you serious? You're not making this up? Why would I make it up? Y-You killed someone? Yes. Police never found out? They never even thought of me. He had so many enemies. He was in debt. That night when he died, I was in hospital giving birth to you. And Papa... Papa knows everything. You-you never once told me... How could have I told you? I... I didn't even want to talk about it. I didn't want to think about it ever. The only reason I'm telling you now is because I have to, because you wouldn't listen otherwise. What? What do you mean? Have you ever noticed that Sandeep's birthday - is nine months after yours? - Usha. I don't under... what do... I don't understand. What does that have to do with anything? He's back, Pallu. He's been reborn as Sandeep. Give... Usha, please. - Usha, please. - You're laughing? Don't do this. Because, um, um, my-my... my brain is breaking. No, this, this is... this is terrible. Do you understand everything I just said? Sandeep told me that everything he does is for your own good. That is exactly what that man told me after hurting me. He told me that while hurting me, Pallu. Ma, I-I-I... I don't know what to say. Have you seen a doctor? There's nothing wrong with me. You sound like you believe what you're saying. Please, Ma, see a doctor. Okay? I-I don't, I don't want to lose you. I will do whatever the hell you want as long as you leave Sandeep before it's too late. No, Ma. No. No? You don't want to lose me, but what will I do if I lose you? You're my life. I-I want you to, I want you to take a deep breath, okay? It's gonna be okay. I know you've been through things that I can't even imagine, but just... just listen. Just listen to me. Sandeep is everything that I want. You asked me if I love him. I do. We love each other. He makes me happy. Can you hear me, Ma? I'm-I'm with him right now. Will you talk to him? Pallu. Will you just talk to him? Okay? She's not taking the engagement well. Hello, Aunty. I know that Pallavi and I are taking a big step, and I know how close you guys are. The last thing I want to do is mess that up. So... I haven't talked about this to Pallavi yet, but... I don't feel comfortable getting married until and unless you give us your blessing. Does that... Does that help? Yes. I would really love to meet you in person. I have a guest room that is yours to claim any time you like. You and Uncle. I love your daughter, and I'm not going anywhere. Okay. Goodbye, Sandeep. You okay? - I'm so sorry. - No. No. I'm sorry. I just... Thank you. I have thought, over and over again, all these years, that I should have been there for you when he was following you. I never should have let things get to where they did. That-that was my failing. So I understand... ...that whatever I say, you... you have no reason to believe me. I accept that. Darling... that's not what I think. But has Pallavi ever given you a reason not to accept her, to-to trust her? No. You have raised a wonderful daughter. And, my God, finally, she has found a wonderful boy. You saved her. Saved yourself, saved us. And, oh, because of that, you are safe. Huh? Now, always. But I don't want to feel like this anymore. - I... - I know, darling. You don't have to look over your shoulder anymore. It's going to be Pallu's birthday - in a few hours. - Ah, right. Hey, we'll, uh... we'll call her this evening when she wakes up. So, I'll collect you at 4:00 sharp. Dr. Mehta is supposed to be the best. - I'll be ready. - All right. Can you throw this out for me? What? Uh, are you sure? It's like you said. I'm safe now. I need to move on. You are safe. All right. - Love you! - Love you! He tried to give me jewelry. Pallu, thank God. Listen. Did you like the earrings I got her? I saw you liked that photo online. So you must've liked those earrings. But of course you do. They're just to your taste, aren't they? I remember you never took yours off. You used to wear your hair up just so everyone could see them. So you could show me how much you loved them, how much you appreciated my gift. What do you want? I told you. I really want to see you. In person. We could be a family. It's amazing. Pallavi has your same... essence, that same spirit. That's what made me talk to her in that coffee shop. I saw her face... and I couldn't resist. Even though I didn't know why. But of course it wasn't until I heard your voice that everything clicked into place. That's when I remembered. Everything. Don't hurt her. No, no, no, I-I promise. I'm going to take care of Pallavi. Till death do us part. As the saying goes. Give the phone to her. I will. Eventually. The fun is just beginning, Usha. Usha? Are you ready? Usha, she has a full schedule, darl... Pick up the phone, Pallu. Pick up the bloody phone. Come on, Pallavi. Hey, it's Pallavi. You know the drill. Pallavi, I don't know when you're going to get this, darling, but please call me. It's urgent. It's Usha. Please leave a message. Usha, if you, if you can hear this, please call me back. Um, uh, can you go faster, please? It's Usha. Please leave a message. Usha, please listen. Think about what you are doing. I'm worried about you. Please, just text me, anything. No matter what, darling, I love you. Pallu? Pallavi? Are you there? Pallavi? My darling. Where is she? You're here. You've changed. We both have. Rakesh... this is between you and me. Leave Pallavi alone. That's not how this works. You don't get to decide how it ends. Not this time. What is it that you want? The only thing I've always wanted, Usha. You. Forever. Um... Why can't you just let it go? Because you're mine. Don't you see that? Where is Pallavi? Behave, and I will bring you to her. We'll have dinner, and you will show Pallavi that I am the husband you've always wanted for her. O-Okay. Dinner. Great. See how easy that was? You know that everything I do is for your own good. Say it. Everything you have done is for my own good. And now Pallavi will finally be happy, knowing that she's the daughter you've always wanted. She is the daughter I've always wanted. I... No, not until she's married. Right, Usha? You'll give her your blessing? Yes. I will. You will? I know you, Usha. Remember? You're lying. Don't lie to me. Don't you want your daughter to stay alive? Who are you gonna call? Everyone thinks you're crazy. Krishnan will believe me. That pathetic husband? You know he doesn't believe you, because you don't love him and he knows it. You're wrong. You taught Pallavi how to settle when you married him. You wanted her to marry a good man regardless of love. All this would have been so much harder if she had been holding out for true love. Even I can't fake that. I really don't want to kill Pallavi. I will come with you. And I will tell her that she has my blessing to marry you. Good. Keep it. If you think it'll help. You know... I never believed in that superstitious nonsense. Joke's on me, right? After you. If I suspect you are trying to sway her, if I suspect even the slightest hint of disobedience, I will kill her immediately. Do you understand? Shall we? Hi. Amma. Pallu. You're here. You're here. What are you doing here? You knew? Happy birthday. Thank you. Oh. Oh, my... I... Actually, Sandeep bought the ticket himself. Wow. Okay. It's so good to see you. Let me take your things. Come in. Sandeep is making dinner tonight. - Oh. - Your favorite. Mirch ki sabzi. Mmm. You planned it all, didn't you? Of course he did. He wanted to make me feel welcome. See? I knew if you just met him in person, everything would be fine. And I look, and Danny is just standing there, - covered in lentils and idli. - Yeah. Oh, my God. And he turns and looks at me. Half of his eyebrows were burnt clean off. It was a disaster. We were cleaning sambar off the ceiling the whole night. Never trust a white guy with a pressure cooker. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sit, Aunty, please. You're our guest, after all. - Thank you. - Yeah, you relax, Ma. You had such a long flight. Oh, you know, I was telling your mom she is welcome to stay with us as long as she wants. What do you think? Oh. Sure, of course. You want to talk to her? Talk to her. I'm right here. Um, Amma, so... Well, I-I didn't get a chance to tell you... - It's all right. - Um... I'm moving in with Sandeep. And I know it's before we're married... I'm happy for you. You're happy for me? Of course I am, darling. But I... You-you were... No, I was wrong before. Who are you, and what have you done with my mother? You should do whatever you want to do. Is everybody done? - Do you want any more before I take this away? - No. Oh, yeah, it was so good. Dinner was so good, Sandeep. Thank you. It was your recipe, Ma. Extra spicy. Could you tell? We literally had to buy more chili powder because we ran out. Yeah, I could tell. It was just like I used to make it, right, Sandeep? Yes. I-I mean, I'm sure yours is much better. Wait, Ma, why did you come alone? Did Sandeep not tell you? Tell me what? I didn't want to ruin the surprise. Oh, yes. It's all right. So, Papa had to work, and he said, "No, you go alone." Really? Mom, you hate flying alone. Whoa. You okay? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Just being a klutz. It's so sweet, though. Sandeep... he bought a ticket for Papa. That was so nice of you. Yes. Of course. It's too bad he couldn't make it. Such a nice man. Didn't want to accept charity. We may not be rich, but Papa can afford a plane ticket. I mean, that can't be the reason. It is, Pallu. You know him. I-It's all right. And I'm not going to be staying that long. - What? Why? - You're gonna be busy, no? You're moving in together. I don't want to be in the way. Shit. Amma, you're mad at me, aren't you? Of course you are. No. Pallu, no. Why-why do you keep saying that? Because I just thought... I guess I was expecting a fight. Pallu, no. I'm so sorry, because I kept pressuring you about getting married, and... and I made you feel like a failure. You could never be a failure to me. I trust you, Pallu. Please, trust yourself. You must be exhausted, Aunty. No? Let's get you to bed. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, we can talk more tomorrow. You should take some rest. Yeah. Okay. Um, where is the guest room? - Oh, I'll show you. - Oh, of course. It's up the stairs, to the right. Yeah, I'll just show her where it is. No, no, no. Come on. We'll do the dishes. - We'll give you a minute, Aunty, okay? - Okay. We'll do the dishes first, and then we'll... - Yeah. No, she... - No, let me just show you. No, right... We... Okay, you want to go up? - Let's go up. No, no. - No, why would we go up? No, that's fine. Let's go up. - You want to go up? Okay, let's go. - No. - We'll all go up. - No, no. Yeah. I'll bring your suitcase up. What the hell is going on? Why are you acting so weird? Okay, it's nothing. Let's just go up. Let's go up. I'll take the suitcase up. Let's go up. Amma, where did you get those? Someone gave them to me in college. Uh, okay. - I think I know what's going on. - They're the same. They're the same. All right, Usha, listen to me. I see what's happening here. You know. - You know exactly why. - You need help, Usha. Pallavi has told me. Let us help you, okay? For your own good. Hmm? Always for my own good, right, darling? Shut your mouth! What? Do you know my mother? Do you know my mother, Sandeep? Drop to the ground. Amma! You're hurt. Fine. No! Let her go. Let her go! Let go! You did this. I warned you. Please. Darling... ...look towards me. I'm here with you. Look at me. Just me... ...my darling. My eyes! Darling. Okay, okay. It's okay. Fucking bitch! You can't run. I will always find you. I will not run anymore. My darling. Amma. Amma. Amma. Amma, stay with me. Amma. Amma. Amma. Amma. - Amma, I'm here. - Pallu. Amma. Amma. Amma? Stay with me, Amma. Meri jaan. You're mine. Don't you see that? Meri jaan. I don't want to lose you. You're mine. Forever. Please just listen. Oh, I'm sorry to wake you. No, it's fine. Uh, your husband called. He's at the airport. He'll be here soon. Thank you. Pallavi's gonna be so happy to see him. Pallavi. The first verse of a song? That's very good. You speak Hindi? A little. Hello. I'll let you two rest. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Pallu. Hi. You okay? - This is all my fault. - No. No. Yeah. I just didn't... I didn't listen to you, and I should've. And I didn't believe you, and I should've. Pallu, it is not your fault. It's over. But it's not over, right? Like, what if he wakes up and... and comes after you again, or me or...? What if he dies and... - Or what if... - So? What if he does? What if he comes back? Come here. - Are you okay? - Mm-hmm. - It's okay? - Mm-hmm. So... say he keeps coming back. What would you say to your daughter? I don't know. Men like this will always be there. So you'll teach your daughter and your daughter will teach her daughter that none of this is their fault. And y-you will face him together. Like we did. Do you know he speaks Hindi? How do you even know that? I'm your mother. - It hurts when I laugh. - Oh, no. I love you. I love you, too, Ma. Code blue, room 305.
