“"Bunker” Yes, it's me. I don't know, I was just picked up by the bus and we left the base. "Great?" What are you talking about? Did you hear what I said? They only took me, why would they do that? Something's not right, there are supposed to be more people. I don't know, the driver hasn't said a word since we left, he just looks at me every few minutes. What? No, he does not have a Western appearance. Okay, you're not help... You're not helping me. I called you with a problem and you're not... I get it but that doesn't help me. Okay... Alright, I... I'll text you as soon as I know more details. Okay. Okay. Bye, Mom. Get in. - Sonofabitch. Motherfuckers... Get the fuck in already! That cute NCO was flirting with me. -Flirting? She had her back to you. - Yeah, to show me her "goods". And the "goods" are very good. Did you see her ass, bro? Just like a plum. Would you tap that? - What do you think? You jerk, what about your girlfriend? No problem, bro, I got enough ammo for two girls. Sure, and his girlfriend will take a bullet from anybody. Funny guy. Want me to make you cry? Cut it out. Just wait 'till we get there, I'll kick your fucking ass. Where's "there"? Where are we going? Givat Kfir. Check out this guy's vault. What's your name, Mister Banker? What? I'm Matan. - You don't say. Nice to meet you, bro, I'm Yishai. This is Roy, and this dead dick is Uzi. Yishai, I'm gonna fuck you up! Come on, guys... Freakout Itay Zvulun, Kai Korabelnikov Ofer Rotenberg Eran Peretz, Assaf Ben-Shimon "Three guys just got on the bus. They look like combat soldiers.” "Be nice." ♪ I think we've entered the Palestinian territories.” "The territories?!" ♪ Your commander didn't tell me anything about that!" "You spoke with my commander?” "Why not? I'm your mother, I'm allowed.” Come on, bro, let's grab a bite to eat. Blondie, leave your rifle in the bus, live a little. That's okay, I'm good. I love this song, turn it up! "We stopped to eat at an Arab restaurant.” Listen up, two Gyros of lamb shashlik with humus, one sinaia with tahini, right? "Don't take any risks, just order a schnitzel.” A pitcher of lemonade and... What will you have? - Schnitzel, if they have it. Schnitzel. And make it fast, we gotta be somewhere, Omar. This place stinks. What? You think these bastards will mess with us? They understand what you're saying. Loosen up, bro. Matan, you a desk jockey? - What? What "What?" You got a desk job? Yes, I serve in the city. - Oh yeah? You a computer programmer? - Something like that. Talk to me, "something like that"... CIS? ADP? BBD? Which one? What's so funny? You're just making up names. "Making up"? Hey, bro, make no mistake, Yishai's a computer whiz, he nearly passed all the exams for that unit. If I had blonde hair and glasses they would have accepted me. That's enough. I didn't get it, what's your job? I'm a military assistant. That's... -A secretary. No. Do you make coffee? - What? -Huh? We're Magach crew members. What are you smiling for? Do you even know what Magach is? It's a tank. Yes, but not the Abrams tanks you see on TV, it's more like... a cheap version of second hand American tanks. "Deep fryers". You know why "deep fryers"? If you get trapped inside, before you suffocate from the smoke, all that's left for you to do in your dying moments is to smell you and your friends' flesh burning. Man, you made me hungry... Blessed are You, God, King of the universe, through whose word everything comes into being. Oh, you righteous man. Look at this guy, eating in an Arab restaurant. This place is kosher, right? Thank you. Yuck. What's with the crappy salad? Omar! Get over here. What is this? -Cole slaw. - I know it's cole slaw, but it stinks, you know what I mean? Fetch a new one. We're in a hurry here, (curses in Arabic) You goddamned dog! (in Arabic) Stop it, don't you get that those are curse words? Of course they are, I know a lot of curse words, want me to teach you? No. -Waiter! -That's okay. - Get over here. -Stop. Come over here. - Stop it. Guys, let's get a move on. What's he honking for, I'm not done yet. Don't worry about it, we'll take it with us. You got... money? I left mine in the bus. - Oh yeah? Let's go get it. Mualem! We're gonna get money. You stay here. - What? Omar, he's staying here, we'll be right back. Matan, Matan, get over here! Matan, Matan, get over here! You are the man! The man! What have you done?! Why did you do that?! Chill out, man, it was a joke. It's not funny. They'll call the police or come after us. We're in an area of Arab villages, they'll kill us. I told you he'd take it too hard. Bro, calm down, it's over. It's not over, don't you get it? It's not over. Hello hello. You guys are so lucky you weren't stuck with our asshole sergeant. He called another drill at the last minute. Really? Let's get outta here. Where's Bar? She was taking a shower when he called us up. Who? -Bar. - What? Didn't you hear? He knocked on the door and told her to get out or he'll write her up on charges. What an asshole. I've seen some interesting movies that start this way. Obviously. You developed quite a muscle in your right arm. Good one. ♪ No signal” Want to borrow this arm? - No, you keep it. "Caution - High levels of radiation!!”® "Soldier! Someone is watching!” "Don't hitchhike; it could be your last ride” "High alert Soldier kidnapping threat” “MOM!" Let's go. What are we doing? - Come with me. Bro, why so stressed out? This your first guard duty in the field? -Yes. Okay, but you did guard duty in basic training, they taught you how to shoot, right? We'll have to shoot? Bro, girls were here before you, you need more than that to calm down? This whole week of guard duty is bullshit. You forget what you did at the restaurant? Maybe they'll come looking for us. So what? What will they do? Kill us? I don't know... Wait, let me understand this, if you ate at a restaurant in Tel Aviv and walked out without paying, no one would do a thing. And here you're afraid that what? That they'll kill you? Because they're Arabs? A bit racist, no? Sit down, bro. Hey you, sit down and relax. Come on. Why don't you put down your rifle? I don't want anyone to steal it. Bro, listen to me, you're among friends here, you got that? And I apologize for what we all did to you, okay? Yes. Thank you. Good. Now, get this through your head, I'm here, I have your back, and I'll break the legs of any Arab who comes near you. Look how cute you are when you smile. Do you feel safe now? Yes. This is more like it, huh? - Like what? Like this. Look at me. What are you doing? - Trust me. No... -Hey... don't look away. - No, no... -Trust me. Come here. -No. - Look at me. -No! Stop! Boner or no boner? You asshole, you came in too soon. Stand up. Nothing. I told you he's not gay. Pay up. Pay up! Leave the poor guy alone already. Hello? -Michal, it's me, put Major Avram on. You arrived already? - Come on... -What do you need? I have to convince him to get me an exemption, maybe he knows someone who can get me outta here. What good will that do? You'll have to do it some other time. I don't care! As long as I'm not with whoever's here now. I totally get you, but Avram's in a meeting, he can't come to the phone. Can you tell him to call me at this number? Okay, but after the meeting he's going home for the weekend, so if this is important, stay by the phone so you don't miss his call. - Okay. Thanks. -Bye. How much longer do we have to wait? | gotta take a leak. Hold it in, you're not a child. - A child? We've been waiting here for an hour. What does he think this is? Basic training? Who is this guy, anyways? Have you seen him? Okay... Let's go. I've had it with this crap. Hey! Hey! What's going on? Are we disturbing you? - What's wrong? What's wrong? You called a drill. No [ didn't. - Yes, we all heard it. I hate doing that. Well... Since you're here... might as well show you what's what. Come with me. Hold on, where's the toilet? I gotta disarm my rifle. The toilet is next to the kitchen. After dinner you'll understand why. “"Bunker” You're wasting your time, there's no signal because of the antenna. It doesn't get along with phones. This thing is what we're guarding? You're risking your lives for this important thing, yes. Doesn't it emit radiation? - Of course it does. It fries your brain and gives your balls cancer, or the other way around... Then why are we stationed here? - What are you worried about? The army looks out for you. The army knows exactly what the effects are of this crap. That's why you're not allowed to be here more than a week at a time. What about you? I'm on a weekly rotation With this other guy. Right, The girls told us that last week's sergeant was a jerk. Adam. He's a tough guy. Not friendly like me. Stas is nice. Adam isn't. What's that thing over there? That's the water supply facility. Keep an eye on that too. Once this Arab kid from one of the villages, came by with his dog, he let it piss and crap on the water flow pipe. The same water the soldiers shower with. They started hallucinating with fever, some of them had nose bleeds, blood oozing from their eyes. From their eyes? How did someone get in here and poison the water... Shut up, pussy, cut the bull. Welcome to the observation tower. I'm Stas, your guide on this tour. On your left, the horizon that separates nothing from nada. On your right, more nothing in the form of mountains and... Nothing but sand. There's nothing to see as it is. What requires your attention are the Arab villages that surround us. That's why you need to inspect your weapon real good. A four hour shift, one man in the morning, at night, one man patrols, another mans the tower. This is the RT. - The what? The radio. As I was saying, once an hour, the air force base makes contact, they are slightly north of here, you answer and say everything's alright. If something's not right, you won't be able to answer anyways... What else? Oh yeah, two things. One, you don't enter my room, two, you don't go into the bunker under any circumstances. That's where the antenna gear is. If something falls, gets crushed, it's Stas' neck. You got that? vthink that's everything. Listen, it can be real nice here. Take it easy, be cool with me, I'll be cool with you. Make a duty roster in alphabetical order and let's get this show on the road. Oh my God, what was that? Okay, Yishai, Matan, Uzi... can it be that I'm last? Shut up, son of a bitch. Matan, any way you can take my shift? I gotta say the evening prayers and there's a soccer game on TV. Yishai, leave him alone. - Shut up! -Stay out of this. I need to be in the rec room, I'm waiting for an important phone call. Sounds good to me. We'll sit by the phone and as soon as it rings we'll come get you. No, I... -Do me a favor, bro, | can't miss this game. But... - I'd go first if I were you, 20 minutes have already gone by since the shift began. Yes. You wanna say yes, don't you? Okay. - What a righteous man! -A prince. But stay by the phone! He wants me to do guard duty at 2 am. Does he think I'm a fisherman? Matan, here. I forgot the charger, but you got another 2-3 hours of music. Take it, you need it more than I do. Thanks. Give me the ball, Give it here. Yishail Get it! Get it! Yishai, what about the game on TV? What? The soccer game on TV? Oh that, it starts in 30 minutes. But you promised to stay by the phone! Yishail Alright already! We'll hear the phone from here. But I told you that it's important! It's an important phone call! Yishai! Yishai! -If he doesn't shut up I'm gonna go up there and kill him. How's the music? Good. Really? Didn't think you were into Middle Eastern music. Yeah, it's fine... You hate it, huh? That's okay, | didn't like it either at first. But when the guys are singing around you all day... you have to get used to it. - "Have to"? Let's put it this way, if Uzi walks by, act like you're singing one of those songs he likes, and he'll show you some respect. Got it. This view is fuckin' amazing. What? I said the view is amazing. Do you know if the base phone rang in the rec room? I don't know, Uzi's been on the phone for the past hour. What?! Yes. Can you replace me for a second? - Yes. For a second. Uzi, I told you it's an important... - But I did. No, the fact that you knew, you knew 1'd see those pictures. But I just saw a picture of you and him on Facebook. At Shirly's party. No, sweetie... Yes, as if it's my choice, to be here for 21 days straight, right. What do you want me to do?! What do you want me to do? Fine, then I'll get a desk job like that dickhead of yours and I'll be with you every day. Then tell me what you want! Hello? Lali? Fuck this. What are you looking at?! Nothing. Yes? - Michal. Where were you? I called you. You missed him. He left. - As if he'd wait for you... Of course he left! - Okay. Take it easy out there, okay? - Thanks. -You're welcome, honey. Sir. Commander Stas. What happened? - Nothing. Stas, I need your help, you gotta replace me. No problem, get someone else and go home. It's not funny, I mean it. What's so bad about being here? - Everything. Is it your friends? - They're not my friends. Get in. Get in! Listen, I've been where you are now, only it was much, much worse. And I didn't have anyone to talk to. No friends, no family, no one. Are you a lone soldier? You know what Stas would do if he were you? What? - Nothing. There's nothing you can do. We're on our own. People are shit. Take Adam, the sergeant | rotate with, such an asshole. You come to him with a request like you just came to me, you know what he'd do to you? He'd impale you on the antenna. It's just for a week. A week? Stas, I'm not staying here for one more day. Are you afraid? No. Here. You'll feel different after the first night. Take it. It helps me. It'll be fine. Hello hello! We come bearing treats. You didn't eat at the restaurant so we brought you some goodies. Take it, Matan, it's good, Uzi's not only a pussy when it comes to his girlfriend, he's a pussy in the kitchen too. - Watch it. Take it. And here's... your cellphone. You forgot it in the rec room. Thank you. By the way, we thought of something. Two of us guarding at night sounds like a waste of time, there's nothing to do as it is. He's right, it's more like one of us is guarding the other so we don't fall asleep. - You get it? So we'll ask Stas if it's okay for only one of us to man the tower through the weekend. You'll see, bro, after that he'll agree to a one man shift all week. Hold on, only one of us will guard at night? What if someone walks through the gate or we get a radio call? Matan, it'll be fine, trust me. No. We need two people. Two. Okay, but maybe Stas will approve... - I don't care, I won't guard alone at night. - Why won't you? My shift is over. Excuse me. Fuck that kid. I'll punch him so hard at night that he won't wake up. Then he'll agree to guard alone? - Of course not, he's a wimp. What a shithead. You should see his cellphone, texting his mommy all the time asking her what to do. Unbelievable, the week is ruined. - No way. It'll be okay. - What do you mean "okay"? Because of him you'll be guarding like a rook y. -Relax! That Stas is cool. He's more fucked up than all of us put together, hell, we could even go out and party tonight if we wanted to. What do you say to that? Roy? Roy! Stael! Matan! What? Replace me for a sec, | gotta take a dump. But my shift is coming up, can't you get someone else? No, bro, get up here, | can't hold it in, come on. Come on, I'm gonna shit my pants, come up here! You comin'? I'm coming down. Come here. What's going on? We're leaving for a few hours. We're not going far. - Yeah, right. Want us to get you something? - You're joking, come on, get out of the car, | get the joke, it's not funny. Go. What? No way! You're not leaving me here all alone! Stael! Stas? Sir, you can't do this to me. I told them, but they said you were... -Don't drive him nuts. You wanted to cross us, this is what you get. Get going. Roy! Say something! I'm done talking. I asked you for a small favor and you gave me the royal shaft. What? No... Wait! Wait! Wait! My phone number's in the rec room, if something happens, call Stas. Don't worry, Matan, we'll be back before your shift is over. Go. - No. You can't... Stop! Stop! Stop! I said stop! You bastards! You bastards! Why? Why? Why is this happening to me? God, why is this happening to me? I never did anyone any harm. I'm a good person. God, protect me. God, please protect me. God, protect me. Hello? -Eagle to Lion, is everything in order? Over. No, everything is not in order. Listen, I'm in the base, someone got in and wants to kill me, I don't know what to do. - I repeat, is everything in order? I said that someone entered the base... Eagle to Lion, why aren't you responding? I said that... Eagle to Lion, Eagle to Lion. Over. Eagle to Lion. Hello? - Stas it's me, you gotta come back quick. - What is it? I hear loud noises, Stas, you gotta come back. First of all, take a deep breath, it must be a stray cat. You'll be fine. - No, I won't be fine. Stas, a call came in from the air force base, I tried to get them to help, but they couldn't hear me. Get them to help? You said you know how to operate the radio! I do, but they didn't answer me, Stas, you gotta come back, | don't know what to do. Now they'll send someone over to the base. Listen to me, everything's okay, those noises are normal we hear them all the time. Get a grip. Go to the radio, see if a wire is disconnected, or some knob set to zero. Contact them and tell them that everything's alright. Do it or we are screwed. These aren't normal noises, they're real loud booms. Stas, do me a favor, come back. Motherfucker. Okay, we're coming back. But you have to get the air force off my back. Go back to the radio, do what Stas said, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello? Hello? Lion, this is Eagle, what's going on there?! Over. What's going on? - Why isn't anyone answering me?! You know we almost brought in the entire command because of you? Yes... uh... The wires got disconnected in the... the volume was... turned down, by mistake. Hello? Okay. Don't let it happen again. Over. Alright. It won't happen again. I'm sorry. - Roger. -Over and out. Yes? Matan, tell me that you spoke to headquarters. I did, everything's fine. - Excellent. So we're heading for no reason. You happy now? What? | can't hear you, Stas. Are you nearby? - Yes, the reception... Open the gate. Stas. - Who is that...? Hello? -Stay in the car. - Where are they coming from? Stas... - Close the door! -Why?! Who's coming? - I'm covering you. -Stas. Hello? - Close the door! Don't let him... I can't hear... -Get in! - Stas, I can't hear you. Stael! Stas? Stas. Stop it! Let me go! Let me go! Hey. Hello there. What? You? No! It's Omar, from the restaurant. Look at him, he's shaking all over. I think he's gonna pass out. Hey, take it easy. Look at you, now you're a man. What? - What do you mean, "what?" We helped you loosen up. Now you won't be afraid of anything. Now you'll go back to your base with some self confidence. The girls in the office will love you. Are you nuts?! I almost had a heart attack because of you! I almost fell when I ran down the stairs! What's so funny?! What if I would've shot one of you? Right, as if you even could. Shut your mouth, you idiot! You're always making fun of me, I'm a secretary and you're a fighter, you think this is how a fighter behaves? Do you?! Someone could have died! Can your tiny brain understand that? What are you laughing about? If you were such a genius you'd understand how stupid this is. Don't tell me that you did this to help me, be more of a man. Pretending to be my friend, you're just as bad as they are. If you were a man you'd tell them to behave, and you wouldn't call me "poor guy" all the time. I'm a poor guy? You're the poor guy, Roy! You're the poor guy! And you... You... Where do I begin?! You moron. Where?! Matan... Get the hell away from me! Go! Get the fuck out of my face! Go! Go! Matan... Matan, I'm sorry, they said you'd laugh too when it's over. Matan. Matan! - Leave me alone, you're insane. Wait up, we said we're sorry. What else do you want? Don't you think it's twisted, all that trouble just to scare me: disconnecting the power, the phone, wearing keffiyehs, tossing a skull into the bunker? What skull? All we did was disconnect the power and the phone. Stop it, it wasn't funny then and it's not funny now. What are you talking about, Matan? Didn't you put a skull in the bunker? Now he's fucking with us. - Yeah, right? Are you fucking with us? I put it there. It's a toy. What toy? From Halloween. And you didn't tell us, you weirdo? You wanted to scare him, didn't you? Stas, go, put the lights back on. Go on. - I'm going. That guy is screwed up. I told you he's more screwed up than all of us combined. Listen, what I saw was no toy. It was a skull with flesh and blood. Stas is lying. Matan, first the Arabs, now Stas. Chill out. Chill out? Fuck. What is that? It's blood. “Chill out♪, huh? "Commander's nest” This guy only has Russian rock. Guys, who's Adam Shchori? That's the asshole who he rotates with. These aren't Stas' clothes. Can I have a look? This isn't Stas' computer either. All the folders and documents... They're Adam's. What are you doing in here? I said you're not allowed in my room. Is this your room or Adam's? - What? Stas, all this stuff is his. Cut the crap and get outta my room. Sure thing. Let's take a walk in the bunker. Maybe we'll find something interesting in there too. You're not going into the bunker or I'll write you up. Write me up, bro, go ahead. I haven't been court-martialed in 2 whole weeks. -One week. You're not going into the bunker. Fuck this guy, who does he think he is? Wait! Wait! They call me a lone soldier, but that title gives me nothing but shame. They don't understand what it means to finally find a home, I have everything here. I have food, a bed, a bath. I told you about that boy who brought his dog here and poisoned the entire base. The first time the kid got away. The second time he came back, I was waiting for him. I killed his dog right in front of him. All I wanted to do was teach him a lesson. Not to invade or poison my home. My home. So I threw the dog's carcass into a duffle bag and put it in the bunker. I beg you, I didn't tell anyone about this, I... All I want is to keep serving here. You can do whatever you want, guard as much as you want. You know me, I'm Stas, I'm a nice guy. But I have... nowhere to go. What now? Who's on guard duty? It's still Matan's shift, isn't it? Fuck off. Fuck off, I mean it. I'll go up there, it's my turn. I'm outta here, poor guy. Matan, your rifle's in the rec room. Cool, I'll get it later. Later? You're not afraid of stealing anymore? You coming? Where to? We're gonna recite the Kaddish for the dog. No, thanks, I had enough. You scared? I'm not scared, it's just gross. That nerd is kinda cute actually. - True. Oh my God, this place stinks! Cool, I'll get it later. Cool, I'll get it later. Predictable. I'm not scared, it's just gross. I'm not scared, it's just gross. Wanna play soccer, Yishai? Wanna play soccer? Bro? Wanna play soccer, bro? Get it away from me. What's this? Corporal Roy Farber, the Antenna Defense Forces. Uzi, what is this? A shirt? Stas only mentioned a dog, right? Matan? Is that you? What's going on here? Roy! Matan! -Stop shouting, go see what's going on! -Shut up! Shit. Roy! Uz... zi... Uzi? Yishai? Stas, you seen Uzi or Yishai? No? They killed me tonight, I'm beat. What about you, Stas, aren't you tired? You washing the dishes now? I'm washing the mess that Stas left. Someone has to do it. So, Stas, you don't know where the others are? The others...? Yes. Why do you care about them? I don't know, they said... You think that they care about you? After all, you're like Stas. A freak. You should be glad we killed them. Be honest, you're glad, right? “Mom Shit. Is this what you're looking for? Stas... Stas, cut it out. What's up with you? You wanna know what's up with me? It's this place. There's something about it... Something good. Like a moth drawn to a flame. You can't feel it 'coz you've only been here one day. But us? We haven't left here for some... two years. I'm on a weekly rotation With this other guy. Stas was told, one week at base, one week at home. But they forgot that he doesn't have a home. So one week he has what he needs, the week after that he has nothing. Then I came. Who is this guy, anyways? Have you seen him? I came to help him stay here all the time. That's how it was supposed to be. Forever. But you walked down to the bunker... Got into my room, huh? Is this your room or Adam's? And you... You... Stas was too weak, he thought you're his friend. But I won't let anyone take this away from us. Stas, stop it. Don't do this, Stas. Don't do this, you're a nice guy, not a killer. You said so yourself. Stas is a nice guy. Adam isn't. I told you to inspect your weapon! I don't know how to inspect a weapon! What... What is this? Roy. What happened, Roy? What did he do to you? "4 missed calls" “Mom Matan! Matan! Your mom's looking for you... Don't you want to take your mom's call? Matan! Stas. Stas isn't here. Stas is a coward. No. No... Stas fucked everything up! A Michal was looking for you on the phone. Oh, yeah. She said they got you an exemption. Before we take you, is there anyone you want to call? Maybe your mom? No. She'll just freak out. Translation: Tammy King Subtitles: Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
