- Excuse me, who do you think you are? - I'm a refugee like you. Why doesn't he have any Palestinians with him? I'm a human being telling you, listen, I'm not working for Israel or Palestine. They are trying to show the whole picture from both sides. Somebody has come to show your story and you kick him out? If you recorded anything, we will remove it. It's an invading organization that occupied Palestine to make a state for Israel. I pray every day, 3 times, that God brings the Spirit back to Zion. This is for me, "Zionist." Growing up in Jerusalem, the only Israelis I ever met were either settlers with guns and soldiers. I saw soldiers beat up children. I was beaten up at least once a week. Most Palestinians have only seen Israeli soldiers and settlers. And I tell you, they are not very friendly. You don't have a future to think about. You have only to think about conflict. So the only thing that you can see is death. It's not a problem between the Jewish and the Palestinians. The problem is between the governments. The problem is in the political situation here. This is a community by itself. You can find rich, poor, religious. Everything in any community, you can find it here. You know, it's less than one meter and a half. Here you can see the noise. Assume that someone was sleeping inside. Or studying inside. Even though we are in this situation, it's even better than the Lebanese and the Syrian ones. Comparing to them, it's like a high, fancy city. Yeah, better jobs for those who are working in Israel. But according, even to the working permits, there are conditions that you have to meet. You have to be married, you have to be over 25. You have to have kids, you have no security issues. And the most important one, you have to find someone who wants to employ you on the other side. 300.000 Palestinians are unemployed out of what? Out of 2.2 million or something like that. The majority of us are youth. I was born in Gaza. In my society, Jihad is the most privileged thing you can get into. So I was hoping for the day that I would become a shahid (martyr) for the sake of the land. I used to dance at my school because some Jews are dying. Even children. I was with my 3 friends. It was a party. We wanted to dance. Just to dance. I was in the line near the discotheque. Liana enclosed me with her body. So because of this... she died and I did not. 21. 16, 15, 17. Children. All of them children. I mean, this doesn't fit the reality here. Nothing ethnic here. Every day enter to Israel more than 30.000 Palestinians that work in Israel. Checkpoints are actually controlling my daily life. And restrict my right of movement. Even between the Palestinian cities. Because closing one checkpoint means separating the south and the north of West Bank in one touch. Each time I go across the checkpoint and they didn't stop me, I ask myself, "Are they crazy? What if I was a terrorist?" This checkpoint serves the southern part of West Bank. So people from Hebron and Bethlehem cross from here. 2 or 3 minutes. And in 5 minutes you'll be crossing the checkpoint. If it's not jammed. This is jammed now. There's no work here. And the salaries, maybe... less than half. The life of these people will be easier. But we do not know exactly how many violent attacks we will witness against the Israelis. It's a kind of paradoxical issue. The facility of life, or the freedom of movement and security. You know why Arabic coffee without sugar? Because you're sweet enough. There were clashes here. One of their cousins was pregnant. And once she smelled the tear gas, it affected the baby. So the baby came out, in a way, disabled due to the lack of oxygen. The doctors at Hadassah Hospital (Israel) said he will not live long. Is everything okay? - Excuse me, who do you think you are? - I'm a refugee like you. Why doesn't he have any Palestinians with him? I'm a human being telling you, listen, I'm not working for Israel or Palestine. They are trying to show the whole picture from both sides. Somebody has come to show your story and you kick him out? If you recorded anything, we will remove it. This is what I was explaining to them! Those guys are just taking advantage of this conflict in a way that there are so many extremely pro-Palestinian crowds who are coming to these places and they keep convincing those people, "Hey, you have to keep mourning. You are the refugees." "Bash the occupation. Bash Israel." "We will give you money. We'll support you." He was telling the family that you were going to meet today that we are Israeli intelligence. This is the conspiracy that we're living in! The biggest two denominations of Christians are Catholic and then Greek Orthodox. Then you have smaller mainstream Protestant churches, then there are smaller Evangelical churches. Not very far from here, just up the hill, is Deir Yassin. The famous Palestinian village where over 100 Palestinians were slaughtered and killed. The Zionist militias, there was no Israel at that time, they were going out with speakers and saying, "Leave your houses, or what happened in Deir Yassin will happen to you." Now we acknowledge that the Jews are victims of the Holocaust, but I refuse to be a victim of a victim. It's similar to the story of Exodus. The saving of one people came on the expense of another people. There is a problem with this. This is why I belong to the Palestinian Liberation Theology movement. We don't take the story of Exodus as a liberating story. When Jesus came to this land, he was under occupation of Romans. He was in a very unjust situation but the Bible tells us He was surrendered. And gave up to the one who judges by justice, which is God. And even in the Gospel of Luke, when the Jewish came up to Jesus and they were sharing about how the Romans killed some of the Jews from Galilee. In my mind as a Palestinian, I was waiting for such a strong response by Jesus. Telling them, "This is an injustice!" "This is an occupation! We should fight it!" And instead of this, Jesus simply replied to them, "If you don't repent, your situation will be same." He said I don't care about politics. About this social and worldly justice. I care about your heart. This is how you read the Bible, but this is not how the Palestinian churches read the Bible. You read it with a Western eye. "If a Roman soldier asks you to walk a mile, walk for two miles." We read it as resistance. Roman law said that a Roman soldier is only entitled to let people carry his heavy armor for one mile. More than one mile, they get punished. You have to do the theological-- No, that's not tricky. I don't want you to be a friend of Palestine. I don't want you to be a friend of Israel. I want you to be faithful to Christ. If Jesus was standing with us right now, and He is looking, what would He preach? "You powerful, I have a message to tell you, and you, the meek, I have a message to tell you." The more you walk, the more you will hear stories. If you ask any Palestinian, "What are your dreams?" You will figure out that his dreams are actually his rights. "I want some education for my kids." "I want a dignified life for me and my family." They're not asking for the moon. This is actually a symbol of the Palestinian right of return. When people fled their houses in 1948, they took the keys of their houses. These actually are for Palestinian prisoners who are spending life sentences in the Israeli jails. The Palestinian Authority's policy created a kind of incitement to commit violent attacks against the Israelis. Those who spend more than five years in the Israel jails, they will get a salary forever, they will get health insurance. They will get a scholarship to study whatever they want and not to mention the other privileges their family will enjoy. They will be perceived as the family of the hero. With the help of Allah, every martyr will be in Heaven, and every wounded will get his reward. Shoot! Shoot! In the name of God. The path of the martyrs is above all. I can easily go and commit suicide. We're happy our school is named after a well-known martyr who played a role and did something great in the homeland. Those stabbing and running over Jews bring dignity to the Palestinians. They're adopting the Palestinian curriculum. Can you imagine, as a child you grew up in the Palestinian society, all that has been heard about the Jews? "They want to kill us. They want to drink our blood." So what I felt is full of bitterness. Full of hate. Yeah this is the majority. This is the flow in general. We are going through a checkpoint in the middle of the West Bank. Yeah, it depends on the situation. So today it's peaceful. Sometimes when they know, for instance, that there is a person who's suspected, the soldiers will be on high alert and they will stop all the cars and will start checking them one by one. We are heading to Huwarah checkpoint. When there is not any violent waves, it's quiet everywhere. Sure. They came to erase us from existence, control our region, take over our country. If we die or leave, it doesn't matter. All my life, I have observed that Jews hate the people. They hate Arabs and Muslims. Their language is weapons and using force. They do not have conversations. It is non-existent. Only weapons. All Palestinians do. We don't hate Israel. We hate what Israel is doing. We are people who want to live in peace and justice. They all were the heads of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. They were fighting here in West Bank. We don't have any problem between the Palestinians or Jewish. The problem is just the Zionists. That's it. Judaism is a monotheistic religion but Zionism is terrorism. As a Palestinian, I don't believe in or recognize the state of Israel. I believe so. Maybe. I think they are behind most of the destruction around the world. No. This is a Zionist invention. So they can make up a justification for occupying us. It didn't happen. They exaggerate it so they can get the entire world's sympathy. and pretend they are oppressed. You ask me If I am scared to have my face on camera? If I had 10 kids, I would send them (to be martyrs) for the Al-Aqsa Mosque. We only do what is legitimate, legal. They are the ones doing illegal things. We will go to Heaven. And they, Allah willing, will be prisoners in Hell. You know, I'm not sad about getting all the Jews from all the world here. Because it's the start of the end of them. All of us here are Sunni. We respect our religion, our Holy Koran, our prophet Muhammad. And we believe everything they say. At the end of the world, be sure about it, when all the Jews come here in this land-- You see this tree? When a Jewish person is hiding beside it, this tree will talk to me. It will tell me, "My Muslim brother, there is a Jewish person behind me. come and finish him!" Yeah. Absolutely sure. If I get a hold of a Zionist or an Israeli, I will beat him to death. I hate them. I do not like Israel. Oh my brothers in the West Bank! Stab them! Stab! They kill Palestinians. If someone comes near the soldiers who they suspect, or maybe if they want to have fun, they shoot the person and throw a knife next to the body. Wow! What a shot! Yes! Regardless of this conflict for me, anyone who supports the Palestinian Authority in this situation is supporting the dehumanization of the Palestinians. The corruption and the dictatorship of the Palestinian Authority makes this conflict worse and worse. I think that they are really victims. But not victims because of what Israel does. Victims because of what their leaders do. You hear every day about financial support that comes to you as a refugee to make your life better. But on the ground, your life is not better anymore. To some specific people's pockets. You are not allowed to speak. We don't have that right to criticize. All the Arab communities are honor-based communities. So if you lost your reputation in this community, you've lost everything. If you were portrayed in your community as a normalizer trying to make good and normal relations with the enemy under the current situation, in addition to losing your reputation, you may lose your life as well. What we think here as a product to this culture, that Israel is just the army. But there is another part that my culture and my education system and my Authority prevents me to see it, The other part of Israel that really opened my heart. Away from the politics. Away from the conflict. Away from everything. Human to human. The reason why the Jewish have kind of a protection now is because they have a Jewish state. If they don't have a Jewish state. They'll be persecuted as they are all around the world. I have equal rights, I have a democratic state. I don't care about what's the religion of the state. I don't think the people hate Palestinians. People don't want just to live. They don't want to die. Like many of the residents here, I've always been dreaming of doing some good things in this town. And here came Neta with her idea for a guest house in Jisr. What does it matter if she is Jewish, Christian, French, or anything else for that matter? At the end of the day, we are all humans. Compared to the Arab world, we are living here in paradise. The rights we receive here are not received in the Arab world. A Jew is a darling! An Arab is a son of a bitch! I served in the Israeli Air Force in the rescue and help unit. The pilots were departing with the helicopters. And many times they would find themselves in Palestinian areas, helping Palestinian people. Take them to Israeli hospitals. In Palestinian Liberation Theology, we do not take the Bible literally, and we don't see God as a real estate agent. We see that all land is the property of God and we all have to be righteous to live in it. They are the cancer here. We call them the rapists. They're living on land that does not belong to them. This village is targeted by the settlers always. I'm looking at a settlement as a place that takes the land. On the other side, I learned to understand how the Jewish had the connection to this land. To Judea and Samaria. When I read the Bible, and I know the Jews have been here since more than 3000 years in this land, how could I believe the Jewish have no history here? One of our problems with the settlements, is distribution of water. The Israelis give a percentage of water to settlements that's more than they need, and the consequences are that we take less than we need. I'm trying to see the entire picture. There are two sides. One is the Israeli side, the distribution of water. The other side is the Palestinians' fault. Repairing or fixing the infrastructure itself. We've had these infrastructures for decades. They're supposed to do this, but actually nobody knows where the money goes. We're driving into this ranch... here in the Judean desert. Oasis in the middle of the desert. These are all olive trees here. Cultivating the desert. Making the desert come to life. Fulfilling the prophecies. Are you thirsty? Want some water? He's a Jew from Ethiopia. Yes. No, Todd. That's what the news tells you. That's not reality. I will give you one month and you will be good. This factory is ours. I feel that this factory is our home. This factory is working 24 hours a day for 6 days a week. We know how to go for vacation together. And of course we know how to work and to make the company a success together. Nelson Mandela said, "Enemies, when they will work together they will break the wall between them." And I believe on that. Yes, I love working with Israelis. Oh, there's a big difference. 5 times more. I earn a living to provide for my family. I had 2 daughters in the university, and they graduated. The Palestinians would be the first to suffer from such a closure. We would lose our livelihood. It happened in plants. They closed, and the workers stayed home. All around the world, also in the Palestinian Authority, they try to boycott my product. The BDS tried destroy me. I'm the solution, I'm not the problem. If we will build more industrial areas maybe we'll bring more hope for the world. More hope for people. And maybe from us, the peace will come. As a Palestinian, when we grow up in a hateful society, becoming a man of love for the Jews and sharing the love of God that changed our hearts, that could make an incredible work for the people of Israel. I believe the main responsibility is on the Palestinian Christians. I remember each day I would cross the checkpoint, I was praying, "God please allow them to stop me that I will share the gospel with them." Each time they would stop me and ask, "Where are you from?" I'd tell them, "I'm from Gaza." They got shocked and scared because most of the criminals came from Gaza. I'd tell them how I used to hate them, and God, Elohim, changed my heart. And I started to love them. They were weeping. Soldiers meeting a guy from Gaza, telling them how much he loved them. If we accept all of them, if we get rid of the bitterness and accept God's love, we have a very powerful message. It's my first time that I try to surf... really with a teacher that knows how to surf good. We will see if I will fall a lot today or make this good. God looks on all the people the same. If you are Arabic, you start to look at Jewish people that they're like you. It's the same. This is what God makes in our hearts when we start to believe in Jesus. I cannot stop telling the truth. Some people are trying to remain silent for fear. But what God has put in our hearts is not the spirit of fear. This is what the Bible tells us.
