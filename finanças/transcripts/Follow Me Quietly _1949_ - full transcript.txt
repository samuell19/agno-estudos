Yes. That's right. Nancy joined the force. Five across. No. I ain't playing no parlay. I'll be glad to get one in the money tomorrow. Yeah. Hold it a minute. Can I help you, Miss? I'm looking for Lieutenant Grant. I ain't seen him around. I don't think he's been in today. No. Forget it. Not me. Not with that jockey. He ain't even a good exercise-boy. Hold it. Why don't you ask Sergeant Collins? With the raincoat. Thanks. It's a pleasure lady, I'm sure. Okay, Al. I got one more. Barney Jones in the eighth. Sergeant Collins? That's right. I'm covering the Judge case. Newspaper? - Magazine. Four Star publications, huh? Thank you. What will it be, Miss? - Just a plain ginger ale. A hot case. If it gets any hotter it will sizzle. A funny thing calling yourself 'The Judge'. The Judge is a funny kind of a guy. Killing people is a funny kind of business. I could use a few facts. Any slant on a likely motive? I once knew a man who used to cut off cat's tails. He didn't like cats. The judge cuts off people's wind. He don't like people, I guess. How about another drink? Thanks. But I am not the guy to buy drinks. You ought to see Lieutenant Grant. He's in charge. I can't get to him. - You bet you can't, lady. With Harry a case is something personal. Same with me. Not quite, lady. Believe me. Not quite. Hello Benny. Hi, Lieutenant. What will it be, Lieutenant? - Give me a glass of beer, will you Dan. The lady would like to talk to you, Harry. She is working on The Judge case too. I am Ann Gorman. You are probably familiar with our magazine. I thought the mayor dumped that magazine in the river with the slot machines. How about a little information instead of your personal opinion? For information, lady. Dial 411. Nothing like a cooperative cop. You boys from headquarters do cooperate sometimes when you need the press. You are not the press. You're not even the yellow press. You don't have to get personal, Mr Grant. Go ahead and throw it. It would be a pleasure to have you pinched and get your press card revoked. Telephone, Lieutenant. Thanks. Better let me have it before it slips. It may seem strange to you but I happen to have a deadline to meet. You shouldn't have to worry about deadlines, angel. Art. Come on. That pick would finish third in a 2-horse race. No, no. A stag party. Taxi. Follow that car. It looks like The Judge is at it again. No kidding. - Yep. McGill. Editor of the Morning Standard. McGill? A funny thing how he always strikes in the rain. Maybe he likes rain. He must be a fish. Hello, Lieutenant. How is he? - Bad. Both legs. More internally. Can I talk to him? - Not now. Hello Lieutenant. Hello, Mr McGill. I always wanted to throw something out of that window. Ha. I didn't know it would be me. - Sorry, Lieutenant. No. Wait. Wait. Ed. Ed. - Right here, Mr McGill. Mr McGill, we'd better get to the hospital. Go to the hospital yourself. Alright, Ed. You got your pencil? Don't bother with him. I am still the editor of this newspaper. 'Exclusive'. 'The Judge'. 'Invades Morning Standard'. 'Editor lives to tell'. 'The man who calls himself The Judge has struck again'. I met The Judge. I am the only victim alive who ever saw him. I was at my desk .. "I heard someone coming towards the office." Want something? "I fell." I .. fell. Hold it, Lieutenant. - No pictures. Press. - No pictures. Fred. Hello John. Some drop. Hello, Inspector. So your pet did it again? Yep. And I put you on this case because I thought you had some imagination, Harry. We are doing our best, sir. Then I'm afraid you are going to have to do better than that. If anyone thinks of anything we haven't done, I sure wish they'd give us a tip. You keep out of this, Art. You have got imagination, Harry. Why don't you use it, man? You've been at it for months. And The Judge has strangled six people. Seven including McGill. A lucky number. You keep out of this, Art. Inspector, I've studied The Judge from every angle. General disposition. Peculiarities. I know him so well I almost live with him. Sometimes I wish I didn't. You want to get off the case? Yeah. As soon as I catch up with him. Alright. But remember, I want results. He is a big help. Lieutenant. Better take a look at this. Uhuh. The usual trademark. If McGill hadn't kept that a secret he might still be alive. McGill was a newspaperman. He was after his scoop. Some scoop. Take it to the lab. - Right. How did you get up here? Connections. - I said no pictures, didn't I? Sorry. Give me that camera. Come on. You like to push people around, don't you. Save the dramatics. - Look, Lieutenant. I am only trying to do my job. How about a story? You get the story when we're ready to release it. I don't mean that. What we want is your personal angle. We pay. In that magazine? No sale. The boss is sold on the story. It means a lot to me. Yes. I can imagine. It's just the kind of stuff that guy would go for. 'How The Judge kills and why'. 'What it feels like to be a killer'. Spicy, isn't it? Just think of all the gory pictures you can use for illustrations. Our readers want to know what's going on. The Judge is a menace, isn't he? Yes. And so are you. Polluting minds so some poor dope gets ideas and goes on a homicidal holiday. Here. You can have the camera. - Thanks. Hey. What is the big idea? Don't you know when it's time to quit? Huh? You know, I once knew a fellow. One of the best men we ever had in homicide. He brooded over every case. You know where it landed him? In the bughouse. That's where The Judge belongs. - Not him. He gets the chair. For life. That is too good for him. Come on, Harry. Why not knock off, have some breakfast, go home and get some sleep? You need it. Sleep? Do you think I get any sleep when I go home? Every time I shut my eyes a blank face stares at me. Oh. I see we got some more of the usual crank letters. 'You are not the law'. 'I am the law'. 'I am The Judge. You will never live to catch me'. 'The day of ..' Here you are, Lieutenant. I found these hairs caught on the button on McGill's left sleeve. The shape of the strands indicates straight hair. They are definitely not McGill's. So, the gentleman's hair is turning grey, huh? I'd guess they came from a Caucasian male. About middle aged. Thanks, Kelly. - Sure. Anyway, we know the color of his hair. So what? We know plenty of other things about him too. Quite a collection of evidence. Reminds me when I was a kid. I used to collect bugs. I was never happy until the set was complete. This collection ought to make you very happy. I would rather have my bugs. There he is. The man we're looking for. All the pieces. In any other case we'd give our eye-teeth for a shred of evidence. Here we have plenty. We know the color of his hair, the size of his shoes, the shape of his head. His height, his weight. We even know how he thinks. Passing judgement on people. Wait a minute. Cool off. Don't take it so personal. Why shouldn't I? He is deliberately defying me. He's on the loose making his plans. And what are we doing? We are standing around slamming our heads against a stone wall. If I could only see his face. I would give a year's pay just to look at his face. Harry. Worrying yourself to death won't make The Judge materialise any sooner. No. I suppose not. I am sorry. Blowing off steam, I guess. That is alright. One of these days all the pieces will fit together the way you want them. And you'll get a real look at his kisser close up. It won't cost you a year's pay either. - Wait a minute. You are right, Art. You are right. I am? - Why, sure. Why didn't I think of it before? The pieces do fit together. Kelly. - "Yes, sir?" Send Henderson and Larson up here. Tell Henderson to bring his sketch book. Right away. - "Right, sir." We calculate The Judge's height to be about 6 feet 1 inch. His approximate weight: 170 pounds. From this piece of textile fabric. We know that he sometimes wears a blue suit. That's about all. Yes. That is a pretty good likeness. From what little I haven't seen of him. From this sketch we are making a dummy. A dummy of The Judge. We use all the evidence we have to make it as accurate and lifelike as possible. What are you going to do, drag it all over town with you? No. We'll photograph it and distribute the pictures to the entire force. It will give the men much more to go on than a routine bulletin description. Well, I guess it can't do any harm. Okay. Make out a requisition for whatever you need. Thank you, sir. Larson, what do you think? Well, I'd like to know a little more about him. Anything else you can tell me? You never know what might be helpful. Sure. Come in my office and I'll give you the complete file on him. Thank you very much, Henderson. That will be all. Here is a complete report on every case. The notes that he left with each victim. Pictures. What we know about his habit patterns and .. All the rest of the data. Six months ago we gave the case a couple of weeks at the most. A man was killed in a vacant lot. Manual strangulation. You couldn't ask for better clues. Cigarette butts. Footprints. And a bit of textile fabric caught on a shrub. Easy. Just a routine case. Until a few days later the same thing happened all over again. This time with a woman. An actress. This time he left a glove and .. A bit of shoelace probably torn off in the struggle. We found this note near the body. Written with the victim's lipstick. 'The wages of sin is death'. What was her sin? Why did he kill her? And here are the rest. All the same pattern. By strangulation. At night. In the rain. And that's just about the story. Mr Larson, how long will it take you to make the dummy? Well. I don't know exactly. It is terribly important that we get it as soon as possible. Alright. Make it three days. Maybe four. You've got them. How did you get in? Connections. You didn't expect me to give up, did you? I hope you're not going to shoot me. It's too much trouble. Better tell the manager to give you your tip back. Look, Mr Grant. I wouldn't be here if it weren't important. I didn't ask you up. You're not my type. I told the boss I would get this story. Why don't you tell that guy to go and jump in the river? Suppose you write the story? Or suppose you write the story on your own terms? Then let me write it. With your byline. I'll make it strictly facts. Subject to your approval. Why should I? Why should ..? Well, why shouldn't you? It's my job to get stories. That's a rotten job. Why don't you quit? Because I need the money to buy gin for my poor old father. And send my kid sisters through school. They are twins with two heads. What is the matter? You were in no hurry before. This .. This dress. Is this part of the act too? I am not putting on any act. Will you sign this authorisation blank? What do I get out of it if I do? Five hundred dollars. You phony. You will check every word with me before publication. I said I would. The five hundred dollars goes to the police relief fund. Whatever you say. Go on. I haven't got all night. Turn out the light on your way out, will you. Gentlemen. In order to give a better idea of what the man we're after really looks like. We've made a life-size figure to replace the usual routine bulletin description. We have all seen the evidence. Evidence which we've used to build this dummy which you are all about to see. We'll give you a brief r?sum?. And a few pointers on the habit patterns of this killer. Who has murdered seven people and successfully evaded capture for months. Are you ready, Art? - Right. What is your name? I am The Judge. That is a nickname. Where did you get it? I was ordained to sit in judgement on sinners. Uhuh. Do you know what you are charged with? Multiple homicides. What are the weapons you use, Judge? My hands. I use both my hands. The notes. Why do you leave notes? I want people to know. I enjoy being talked about. Tell us about the rain. Rain makes me restless. I get excited. What do you do when you get excited? I kill. Well, gentlemen. That's it. Not bad, Harry. Not bad. Thank you, Inspector. I must say it wasn't such a bad idea after all. The darned thing would give you the willies. He is not a bad-looking chap. No sex appeal. Inspector. In contacting The Judge. What's our course of action? Bear in mind at all times. That you're dealing with a man subject to periods of criminal insanity. In case of doubt, my orders are .. Shoot to kill. Are you kidding? That nag hasn't been in the money in nine starts. Say, Lieutenant. I'll call you back. I got something for you. Something important. There's a filly coming out at Bay Meadows tomorrow. They've had her under wraps. This is the McCoy. Benny, will you stop. Lieutenant. Hello. Waiting for somebody? - Uhuh. You. They said I may catch up with you here. Who is 'they'? - Connections. I signed the authorisation blank for you, didn't I? What more do you want? I'll have a cup of coffee please. A galley proof on your first story for Four Star crime. You didn't waste time, did you. The story is hot. The boss is so pleased he's given me a bonus. Good. I'll make an honest woman of you yet. What is this? It's a story about the dummy. - That's right. And I have some swell pictures to go with it too. How did you find out about all this? Connections. And the authorisation helped. Your name carries a lot of weight in the right places. You used my authorisation blank to get this information? Of course. It's all part of the story. The dummy is your idea, isn't it? Look. The angle on the dummy is for the police department only. We're not even releasing it to the regular press. Gee, that's swell. Then Four Star has a real scoop. I am not okaying any part of this and you're not printing a single word of it. But you can't do that. The story is already on the presses. Then get it off the presses right now. Remember your name's on the dotted line. - Subject to my approval. What if I don't stop the story? Then I'll fold that magazine of yours so fast you won't know what hit you. Excuse me. Hey. Don't you want your coffee? Give it to the lady. It may wake her up. This is legit. The jockey's wife is betting a bundle and that's good enough for me. It's my dough, ain't it? Yeah? Yeah, that is right. Good. Good. I will be right there. You're just in time. They've got him. - Who? The Judge. One of the crank letters paid off. Come on. He is down at the Norman Street station. What's your name? The Judge. Where do you live? I don't want to live. I'll bet that is a pack of lies. Judge, you seem like a pretty intelligent man. Why did you do it? Somebody had to make a start. The first start. With what? Changing the world. We have got to change. I see. Let me see your hands. Take off those gloves. Tell me. That woman. The actress you killed. How did you do it? I strangled her. Just like all the others. Show me how you did it. Come on. Strangle me just the way you did her. Faker. You're no more The Judge than I am. That woman was strangled from behind. What are you trying to do, horn in? Take him over to Psycho. You've been reading too many magazines, bud. It's raining, Deadpan. Does that mean anything to you? Figure on going someplace tonight? Where are you now? A pool room.? Or a saloon? Maybe with a girl, huh? No. Not you. You are all frustration. Tell me where you are going. Maybe I will meet you there. How about a date? A blind date with me. Sure. Where do you want to go? You'd better take it easy, Harry. A guy can go nuts. The boys figured we'd be great in vaudeville. Me and Deadpan. Look. If you want to talk to a dummy, why don't you talk to me? I got a hunch deadpan is going on the prowl tonight. You and your hunches. Just because it is raining. Now, what does that prove? There were plenty of rainy nights when he didn't show. Come on. Let's go to the tavern. It will be raining there too. - No, no. I am too restless. This rain makes me nervous. I think I'll go for a ride. You know something? You're getting more like The Judge every day. Flattery will get you nowhere. Where do you figure on going? - Oh, Just a cruise around. Want me to go along? No. You'd better stick around here in case something turns up. You give me the willies. "37 and 39. Respond." "All units. A reported 211 at Central Bank." "Suspected." "Report on a 459." "14." "One. Four." "Okay for 7." "Traffic 3. Investigate accident at Spruce and Central." "Ambulance follow up." "991 Court Street." "A bank. Code 30." "66 New York." "Use caution. These men are armed." "At Maple and Main." "Traffic 7." Harry, I wanted to .. - What are you doing out here? It's kinda damp out here. Do you mind if I get in? I was on my way to your office when I saw you drive out so I followed you. You could have saved yourself a trip. There's nothing here your magazine will be interested in. Not even a corpse. Harry, I didn't come here for a story. I just wanted to explain that I .. "Car 71." Do you have to listen to that? I thought you liked crime. It's a wonderful commodity, crime. Something to take care of the rent. Pay for permanences, buy new dresses. You are getting a big kick out of making me feel cheap, aren't you. Well, I .. I guess I have it coming. But I wish you would listen to my side of it. You know it is my job to get stories any way I can. You must like your job an awful lot. Or else you really need the money. I am not kidding myself about my job. But I have always wanted to write. That's why I came to this town in the first place. I was down to my last dollar when I got the job and I was darned glad to get it. Maybe it isn't the sort of thing I dreamed about .. But at least I am writing. Alright. Alright. Skip it. I admit it was a cheap trick using your name the way I did. I am sorry. I apologise. It won't happen again. Here is your authorisation. "Cars 42 and 87." "Go to 411 Maple Avenue." "Homicide." "Attention. Cars 42 and 87." "Go to 411 Maple Avenue. Homicide." "Attention. Cars 42 and 87." Hello, Lieutenant. - Hello, Bryce. The lab is on the way over. The coroner should be here any minute. Did you throw a cordon around the district? Yes, sir. All taken care of. - Any idea what time it happened? The call came in just after 11 o'clock. Who turned it in? - Her husband. Mr Overbeck. He is in the kitchen pretty badly broken up. Mr Overbeck. I am Lieutenant Grant of homicide. I am sorry to bother you at a time like this but .. Do you think you could answer a few questions? I don't know. It is .. It is such a terrible thing. Why should anyone want to do such a terrible thing? It'll help us a great deal if you'd tell us when and how you found your wife. This is my bowling night. I got home about eleven o'clock. When I let myself in. There she was. Well, did you .. Did you see anybody? Huh? Did you see anybody? No. Nobody. Just her. There she was. Just lying on the floor. Do you think it was The Judge? It looks like it. Follows his pattern. We missed him by a half hour. I am about ready to quit. She was his 8th victim. We're no nearer a solution than we were at the start. It's not your fault, Harry. You have done everything you can. It's almost funny. I had a feeling he was going to strike tonight. And there wasn't a thing I could do about it. A tough break. Maybe Mulvaney is right. Maybe I ought to get off the case. Give somebody else a chance. What do you want to do? Walk out and admit you are licked? No, Harry. That's not you. You cannot give up. You are not the type. [ Police siren ] Here comes the crew. You'd better go on home. I'll have one of the boys drive you back to town. Well, Lieutenant? - Hello, Kelly. In there. - Right. Hello, Doc. You had the right hunch alright. A lot of good it did me. Manual strangulation. The bruises on her throat. And the position of the body show the killer was behind her when he struck. It sounds like The Judge alright. Yes. It's exactly the same type of strangulation as the others. Kelly, have you photographed this? Yeah. I got it. Thanks. Mr Overbeck. Do you read this magazine? No, sir. What about your wife? Did it belong to her? No. My wife never read that kind of a magazine. Kelly. - Yes, Harry? Take this to the lab. Right. Think you've got something? You never can tell. You know, this magazine is over a year old it is still in perfect condition. So? That might mean it has been purchased recently. People usually destroy old magazines. Throw them away, burn them. Go on. Magazine are ordinarily published in three classifications. The first group has no identification mark. That is called 'Boy sale'. Kids on the street? - Hmm. The second group is marked with an 'A'. Agent's copy. They are sold by agents to subscribers. And the third is marked with a star. They are sold in newsstands and are called 'NewsStand Editions'. This is an 'NSE'. What does that tell us? We know it isn't a first edition. Because Four Star has been in business for several years. I'd say this magazine was purchased recently .. From a second-hand bookstore where they handle back issues. A bookstore? Honey, you ought to be working for homicide. Gerry. Gerry. Get me a list of all the second-hand bookstores in town. Right now. - "Yes, sir." Well, do you know him? The ma I am thinking of wears glasses. What kind of glasses? Just glasses. Here. Does that help? That is better. Yes. Yes. I think I know the man you mean. - Can you describe him? Describe him? There is not much to describe. He is just a .. a man. Middle aged. Grey hair. Always smoking a cigarette. Do you know his name? No. I don't. He just drops in here picking up magazines. Like this? That's right. You know, I asked him one day why he reads this junk. He said it puts him to sleep. Do you know where he lives? - No, I don't. How long has been your customer? - A couple of years I should say. Do you remember when he was here last? I think it was the day before yesterday. Thanks very much. You've been a big help to us. We'll keep in touch with you. You'd better assign a couple of men at this store. Right. - Taxi. Ann, you put us on the right track but I think we'd better take over from here. Do you mind if I stick around? Don't worry about your story. I'll see you get it first. I wasn't thinking about the story. I'm glad you said that. We'll have dinner at The Tavern. At Seven o'clock. If I am late wait for me. Art, this is it. We've struck pay dirt. Yeah. If he buys magazines here he probably lives somewhere nearby. We check the laundries, pool-rooms, markets and saloons. It's a cinch. All we have to do is turn the neighborhood upside down .. And shake all the buildings until he falls out of one of them. Let's start shaking. Gee, Lieutenant. I don't know. We get so many customers. You say he wears glasses? - That's right. He smokes cigarettes all the time. Maybe he reads while he eats. Ah, the studious type, huh? Me, I don't go for that type. My boyfriend. He is no bookworm. He is the athletic type. All muscle. Always on the go. Likes his fun. Gosh, Lieutenant. You sure do remind me of somebody sitting there reading like that. Try and think. I can't. I don't remember. Look, young lady. I'm afraid we'll have to take you down to police headquarters. You are not going to arrest me? I ain't done nothing, Lieutenant. No, no. I just want you to meet a fellow. I sort-of hope you will be able to recognise him. I don't know. My boyfriend. He is supposed to pick me up in an hour. We'll have you back in plenty of time. Sit down, please. You all ready? Shoot. Gosh .. am I nervous. Do you know him? Sure. That is Charlie. Charlie who? Charlie Roy. Well, what is he doing here? Are you sure this is Charlie Roy? Sure I am sure. Gosh. I sure thought that was Mr Roy. Do you know where he lives? Yeah. He lives just around the corner from the lunch room on Green Street. Gee, he's an awful nice guy. He always leaves a tip and never tries to get fresh. Gosh, I don't understand. Charlie Roy. Number 4. It must be upstairs. Looking for Charlie Roy? Yes. And he doesn't seem to be in. Are you the manager? Yes, sir. What has he done? Got a passkey? - Why, sure. A nice fellow, Charlie. No gambling, no women, no drinking. I don't mind his smoking. A fellow has got to have a vice of some kind. Yep. Yes, sir. Come in. What does he do for a living? I don't know. He used to work in a freight office. He knows all about interstate tariffs and routes. He pays his rent on time and all the kids like him. A regular library. He reads all the time. 'Hamilton's handbook of criminal procedure'. 'Law and the Insane'. What is in there? - I don't know. It's locked. - Got that passkey? Yes, sir. Here it is. His own little private chamber of horrors. Yeah. It looks like he was all set to shoot it out. I can't believe it. Mr Roy is such a nice fellow. They are all nice. He's running true to form. An egomaniac. [ Footstep sounds ] See who that is. Go ahead. Come on. Hurry up. It's still leaking in the bathtub Mr Mark. I'll take care of it. - You'll take care of it? That is what he said last week. Let's put this stuff back. Me with 5 children to cook for, and wash and iron for, and one more on the way. Alright, alright, alright. That was Mrs Schultz who lives up in Number 6. Her bathtub is leaking again. You have any idea where Mr Roy is? I don't know. He should be home by now. Now? Let's get our car out of sight. Whose apartment is this? - That is mine, sir. Open it up. - It is open. That's him. Get Mulvaney and the boys and have them surround this place. Harry. Where are you? Over here, Art. Are you alright? - Yeah. He's around here somewhere. He went up those stairs. Alright, Judge. Show me your hands. Follow me quietly. Come on. Hello? Okay. Shoot. I sure can use a hot tip. No. That one ran out of the money. What? The last time that nag ran they forgot to unhitch the milk wagon. Hold it. Say, Collins. Nice work, you and the Lieutenant cleaning up that case. That was a real photo-finish. - You said it. Anyway, you two won't have to get your feet wet looking for The Judge anymore. I am not so sure of that. Benny. I'll give you odds we'll be out looking for another judge pretty soon. Ha. That is no bet. What? They ought to send that nag back to the farm. To raise a family. ..r-o..
