[Judge] Will the accused please stand? William John Brown. It is the finding of this court that you, William John Brown... did willfully and with premeditation brutally slay and sexually assault eleven innocent women of this state... I therefore feel no remorse in implementing the highest penalty in my power that of the sentence of death. [echoing] Death, death, death, death...

Let it flow through your bodies. Replace the blood in your veins with music. Look here, Samantha, we're all not Jamie Lee Curtis. We're ordinary people, all right? Ordinary. How boring. I thought the Stay Awake was organized to raise funds for the school. That means goodies and videos, not a torture session. You can talk. Look at you. You're fat! Gross! My mother said it's puberty fat. It'll go away when I get older. Huh! You wish, sweetheart. The way you indulge in "goodies", as you call it, you're going to need a crane to move you around very soon. Cut it out, Samantha! Leave Debbie alone or I'll rearrange your face! Hhh hmm, no class. - What is that? - Oh come on, I'm enjoying it. It's okay for you. You're in great shape from all that athletic stuff. I'm a bookworm... and I don't see anyone around here reading. - [giggling] - Look. I hate silly arguments. So let's vote on whether we carry on or not. Girls? - Hhhh. - [music cuts out] That's funny. It's gone dead. It's tired and I share its sentiments. Check the plug. Uh, nothing wrong here. What about the cassette. It could've jammed. That thing's expensive to jam. We all know Samantha gets the best of everything. - [scoffs] - [laughing] That's funny. It's never done this before. Ahhh! Without a radio, no music. No music, no torture. Look. - [sizzling noise] - [All] Ew. [Girl] Oh, my! Maybe... Maybe it was a short circuit. [maniacal laughter] [growling, snarling] [growling continues] [growling] [maniacal laughter] [electrical buzzing sound] Here. [footsteps approaching] - [growling] - Ahhh! [Girl screaming on video] What's happening? It's all right. She's getting up. Please tell me when it's over and I can look again. Ooh, he's just jumped on her back. [sobbing] [door opening] [gasps] Hi, Miss Walton. Over here. We saved you a place. [sobbing, screaming] - [Miss Walton] Hi, guys. - Hi. [screaming continues] You're missing a real scary movie. Listen, Amy, I'm going out to see Mr. Stark. - I won't be long. - Is anything wrong? No, I'm just going to see that he doesn't forget to lock up. You know he sometimes has a nightcap. I see. Okay. But hurry back. You're supposed to protect us from ugly, scary monsters, right? Really, Amy. Monsters at your age. [Child on tv] Mommy, Mommy, help! - Help! Help! - Hi, Miss Walton. Help, Mommy! Mommy, help!

[knock] [knocking noise] [knocking noise] [music playing] Hmph, music. [turns music off] Huh. [groans] [easy listening music playing] [knocking on door] Just a minute. [knocking continues] Miss Walton, come in. Come in. Thank you. - I'm sorry to worry you. - No, no, no, no, not at all. Please, take a seat. Oh... Some coffee? I was just about to make myself a cup. t's no trouble. Thank you, but no thank you. I must get back to the girls. Oh, of course. The Stay Awake. Well, what can I do for you, Miss Walton? Well, I don't really know where to start. You see, when I arrived here earlier, I heard some strange noises in my science lab. [woman screaming] It sounds like vandals to me. Maybe we should call the police. I mean, with the girls here and-- Now, now, now, there's no need to call the police. If there's anyone around that shouldn't be... I'll fix them. Or scare the living daylights out of them anyway. This school is so secluded. What would vandals be doing out here? One thing I learned in the Army, Miss Walton, and that's to expect your enemy any time, any place. Now don't you worry. When I lock up the gates, I'll take a good look around the school. So you just go and do, what, whatever you and the girls do at a stay awake. Thank you, Mr. Stark. You'll let me know if you find anything. Now don't you worry. You'll be the first to know. Now, let me walk you back to the gym. [growling in distance] [growling continues] [growling] Don't know what the world is coming to these days. You've got to carry a gun with you all the time. [growling] [growling] [growling] Like I said, don't you worry, Miss. You and the girls are doing a grand job staying up all night to raise funds for the school. - You enjoy it. - Thank you, Mr. Stark. [gasping] [screaming] Ah-hah! We were only playing, Miss Walton. [giggling] What's going on? It was supposed to be a joke, Miss Walton. Yeah. We're sorry we scared you, Miss Walton. We really are sorry, Miss Walton. It's okay, girls. I just overreacted. Well... I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stark, but as you can see, it was all just a joke. Hmph. Some joke. Well, I'll go and lock up. Look, girls, I'm also sorry. It's just that we suspect that there could be or were some vandals on the school grounds tonight. I told you it wasn't a good thing to do. Well, how were we to know? It was no one's fault. Let's just forget about it. Mr. Stark has got a shotgun. He's going to make sure that we're all safe. Okay. You've watched enough movies. How about a game of volleyball? More torture. Will I ever live to see the morning? [growling] [music playing on radio] Now once we're inside guys, you can do what you like. but you steer clear of the geography room, right? [All] Right. Hey, don't forget to ask about-- come on, you know. Yeah, sure, I'll ask. No, count me out. I only came along for the ride. Ah, suit yourself. I'm with Robby. Well if you're out you won't get in... And if you're inside, whoever you are, God help you. [whistles] [thunder in distance] Right, it's all clear. Hey, your lights are on, man. Arnie, go and kill the lights. I'll go first. Ah, come on. - [grunts] - [giggling] [yelling out] [thunderclap in distance] Okay, now once we've finished inside, we meet back here and we reverse the whole operation. Okay? Right. Okay. Come on, then. Okay. [Girl] Come on, Allison! - [giggling] - Come on! [growling] [shouting] - Okay, start again. - [giggling] Ugh! - Get it! - Aw! [giggling] - Come on! - Ugh! - Allison! - Ah. [giggling] [gasps] Shit. [sighs] Smells like the ass end of a camel. Little buggers have been sick all over the place. Probably kids with too much booze in them. Probably miles away by now anyway. Time for the game on the telly. No use hanging around here looking for ghosts. [playful noises] - Ah. - Come on, Jennifer. You guys can never do anything right! Oh, come on, Samantha. We're not playing for a trophy. Okay, guys, let's take our things and hit the showers. - Now you're talking! - Hey, ya! Hey, this is more like it! I can't stand all this exercise... [thunder in distance] [girl laughing] [playful laughter] I can't help it. Oh, don't make me laugh! [whispering] Should we stop for a cigarette? Of course we should. [playful yells] [overlapping chatter] [growling] [gasps] [growling continues] [rustling in bushes] [sports game playing on television] Mm, mm, mm. [t.v.] Now the Grand Prix. Go on, pass! Pass! [playful laughter in background] [tv in background goes in and out of reception] Get him! Get him! Go! Go! [creature chattering] [whistle blows, tv reception fails] Damn. Must be the antenna. [growling] There's that smell again. Same as in the passage. What's going on here? Who's out there? [door jiggling] I'm warning you, whoever you are, I'm armed. [screams] Hey, have you done your maths? - Yes, I have. - Please can I copy you? No, you can't, because it's mine. It's probably all wrong. [giggling] Hey, Deb. Come on and give us a show! Yeah, come on, Debbie. Woo! Come on, Deb! Come on! Come on, Deb! [cheering] [humming striptease music] [cheering] [giggling] Hey, get down, Arnie. This is men's stuff. - Aw, gee guys. - [giggling] Hey, they're coming out! Let's get out of here! Hey, this way. [sound of clock ticking] [thunder in distance] Well, now that the radio's burnt out, let's talk about something. I know. Let's talk about boys. How boring. Can't you think of anything else, Samantha? Just because you don't like boys doesn't mean we can't talk about them. I bet Allison here could tell us all we need to know about boys. - Hmm? - So I'm popular, what's wrong with that? I believe that modern day women are too promiscuous. Girls should save their virginity for the man she'll one day meet, fall in love with, and marry. And what if you jump into bed on the first night, realize you're just not making it together? [giggling] So what do you think, Miss Walton? I think you all have some valid points in your arguments. I think I may have eaten too many potato chips. Um, may I please be excused, Miss Walton? Of course, Allison. Take Amy with you. She looks half asleep. She could do with some fresh air. This is supposed to be a stay awake. I don't mind going alone. You know the rules, Allison. Buddy up or you don't go anywhere. Come on, Amy. What about you, Jennifer? You haven't said a word. Oh... I don't really go for boys, Miss. They're only after one thing. Jason! [gasps] What took you so long? Miss Walton insisted on a chaperone, so I had to get rid of Amy first. And where'd she split? Huh! She's too dumb and innocent to split on anybody. Allison? Allison! How about a cigarette? Now? Yeah, now. [growling] [bushes rustling] [baby crying] [crying continues] [crying continues] Allison? If that's you, stop playing games. [crying continues] Allison? Allison? [screaming] [muffled growling] [screaming, sobbing] - What is it? - Sorry. It's just that I thought I heard something like a scream. Maybe it's the vandals you were talking about earlier, Miss Walton. What about Amy and Allison? Mr. Stark said that he would check the school and that he'd tell us if he found anything strange. [screaming, sobbing] It's past midnight. They've been gone for some time now. They say at 12 O'clock the ghosts and monsters start walking the Earth. I'm sure it's all right. What's that? What? What's wrong? Oh, shit. [growling] Jason! [sobbing] [growling] [screaming, sobbing] [growling] [screaming] Maybe Allison's been feeling sick. She did say she'd eaten too many potato crisps. Look, just to make sure, Jennifer, take Carrie with you. Find out what's keeping them. In the meantime, let's watch my favorite video, Lost Love. I've seen it over and over and I always cry. That's all I need, a sloppy love story. Can I go with Jennifer, Miss Walton? I hate love stories. Anyway, I need some fresh air. Let her go. I'm sure Carrie will appreciate it more than she would. Anyway, she can give the boy a bloody nose. Hey, watch it! Let's not get personal, okay, bigmouth? I was only making an observation. - I didn't mean to... - Cut it out, you two. Okay, what's this about a boy? Observation? You can't keep anything to yourself, can you? We might as well tell. Maybe something has happened. Stop it! I demand to know what's going on! - [growling] - Hey. What do you guys think? I got it. King Kong. I think it'll scare the pants off them. Allison didn't really go to the toilet, Miss Walton. - She went to meet a boy. - What boy? His name is Jason, from the college in town. Since Allison had her abortion last year her parents have forbidden her to see boys. So she arranged to meet him here tonight. I'm supposed to look after you all. I'm responsible for every one of you. Why didn't one of you tell me about this meeting between Allison and this boy? It's was supposed to be a secret, Miss Walton. Hmm. Like honor among thieves. Don't you realize that the people who vandalized my science class could be this boy called Jason and maybe some of his friends? Mr. Stark was walking around with a shotgun. Somebody could have been shot! Shall Jennifer and I go now? Yes, and I want you all back here right away. And that includes the boy. Right. Come on you guys, hurry up. [music from movie] [man in movie] You look great! [movie echoing] [movie playing] [conversation in background] What's up, Robby? [conversation continues] Who the hell does she think she is-- [yelling, screaming] No need to get rough. We were only joking. [moaning] Hey guys, where is that awful smell coming from? Yeah, but what's that sound? Sounds like someone's splashing a wet floor mop around. Well, whatever it is, it sure stinks. [movie playing in background] [growling] [all screaming] [growling, screaming] [movie playing] No! No! [woman in movie] I want to know. I've heard these rumors, and now I want to know what the truth is. [man in movie] Why now? [woman in movie] Because today is the day for knowing the truth. Why do men treat women like half wits? Are you ashamed of me? Switch off the video machine, Samantha. But, Miss Walton, the best part is coming. I said switch it off. What's wrong, Miss Walton? You look worried. Look, I-I don't want you to worry. It could just be nothing. You're worried about the others, aren't you? Well, it is forty-five minutes since Cheryl and Jennifer went and looked for Allison and Amy. Do you think something's happened to them? - The vandals, maybe. - It can't be vandals. Mr. Stark would've found them when he checked the school. [gasps] - Hey. - Ah... Okay, the lights are probably just fused. Let's not jump to any conclusions. Right. Now we're all going to look for the others. If we don't find them, we'll used the phone and call the police, okay? - It's scary, hey? - Right. Stick together, girls. Hey. Come on. [growling] [growling continues] [Miss Walton] All right. [water dripping] Allison? Amy? Cheryl? Jennifer? Come. [growling] [Miss Walton] Well, if they're not here, then where are they? [Girl #1] Maybe they took another way back to the gym. [Girl #2] It's just not logical. We took the shortest way. [growling] [baby crying] - [crying] - What's that? [crying continues] Maybe it's the others trying to scare us. Isn't it, Miss Walton? It's just like something that Cheryl would dream up. - Cheryl? - [baby crying] If that's you, stop it immediately! [heavy breathing] [Samantha] I told you it was them. [roars] [screaming] It looks like... It looks like a person's head. [screaming, sobbing] Carrie, stop it! Stop it, Carrie! Hey come on, it's just another joke. It's a mask from our play "Jungle Book." You know, the gorilla. [nervous chuckles] Come on! [giggles] It is the mask. I told you I was right. It's heavy. There's something stuck inside. [maniacal laughter] [screaming] [screaming] Stop it! Okay, stop it! We must find a phone. What about Mr. Stark's apartment? No, the closest phone is in the school kitchen. - Come on. - Toby's gone! - [Toby sobbing] - Toby? We must find her! Do you think Allison and the others are dead as well? I don't know, but right now we must think clearly. Let's go find Toby. Don't look at it! Oh-- Ooh. [sobbing] [cries out] - That was Toby! - We must help her! - Toby?! - [gasps] [screaming] [growling] [screaming] Help her against what? [screaming continues] Can we help her? I don't think so. All we can do is get to a phone and call for help. Come on. [screaming] [growling] [screaming] This is William John Brown, but you can call me the Angel of Darkness. Who are you? What do you want? Why are you doing all this? [maniacal chuckle] I was given new life to complete my task here on this foul, stinking earth. I will ravage all the young girls, and you, my darling Trish, will be my favorite prize, for you wear the sign of our enemy. I must go now. I have a bride waiting for me to plant the seed of evil deep within her. [maniacal laughter] "You wear the mark of our enemy." [sounds of women giggling] It sounds like a psycho to me. [gasping] [sobbing in background] I'm afraid it's-- it's far more than that. [sizzling] Our last chance is to go for the car. - Let's go. - Right. [sobbing] [sobbing] [Ghost] Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came down and chopped off his head. - Hickory dickory dock-- - Stop it! Stop it! The mouse ran up the clock. The clock struck one. The mouse ran down. Hickory dickory dock. Your time is running out. There's no use hiding. I know where you are. One, two, three... [growling] [Ghost] Seven, eight, nine, ten... [growling, ghost continues] [sobbing] [electrical noises] [maniacal laughter] [screaming] Okay, come on. Damn it. The keys are in the gym. - What do we do now? - We'll have to go and get them. I'll go. No, we must all stick together. Let's all go. [female voices] We who are now mistresses of the darkness hereby give our bodies and minds to service the master that is growing in us. They will grow and discard our souls to form the basis of the evil forces that will one day conquer the world. We pledge this to our master until the end of time. We who are now mistresses of the darkness hereby give our bodies and minds to be servants of the master that is growing within us. They will grow and discard our souls to form the basis of the evil forces that will one day conquer the world. We pledge this to our master until the end of time. We who are now mistresses... So far, so good. Samantha, check the gates. Open the door for Samantha. - [engine stalling] - Come on! Oh! [engine stalling] Goddammit. Come on! [Carrie] Is it going to start? [engine starts] The gates are locked. We'll just have to go through them. [revs engine, tire squeal] [brakes screech] [gasping] Why are we stopping? I didn't do anything. It stopped by itself. [maniacal laughter] [laughter continues] If you want a fight, damn it, you're going to get one! [maniacal laughter] [screaming] [laughter continues] [maniacal laughter] Okay, let's get back inside. [laughter continues] This is only the beginning. For soon the world will submit to the inevitable powers of darkness. [grunting] What the hell are we doing trying to break into the sports storeroom? Look. I'm not even going to try to explain, but if I'm right about what we're up against, then we better arm ourselves so we can stay alive until the morning and that includes you . I'm doing this to try to save your little butt, Miss Curtis. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just don't want to die. We're all scared, Samantha, but we're still alive. And if I have to kill whatever it is with my bare hands, - then I will! - We'll take turns. We're going to be a team, right? Right. And we'll damn well win. [thunderclap in distance] Maybe it's gone away. I don't think so. Now remember, when it appears, no matter what it looks like, don't panic. Try and hit it with your javelin. But I've never thrown one of these things before. Well, I suggest you learn very quickly. What's that awful smell? [growling] And that sound? [roars] I think we're about to find out very soon. [growling] Now remember, when I say so, run straight to the school chapel and stay there until the sun comes up. [growling] - [roars] - Don't panic. When I say 'now' then throw your javelins with all your might. Try for the eyes. Oh, shit. [roaring] [roaring] [Miss Walton] Okay, get ready. And now! [wailing] Now run. Come on, hurry! [gasps] [clanging] Ugh! Ahh! [ghost voices] No use hiding. I know where you are. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ready or not... here I come. No power is as great as that of the darkness. [maniacal laughter] [ghosts laughing] [telephone ringing] It's the phone. Maybe we should-- No! Miss Walton told us to stay! But it could be help. - Carrie! - Carrie! - Carrie! - Carrie! - Carrie! - I must get help! Carrie! Carrie! Carrie, it could be a trick to lure us out. Now calm down! [ringing continues] I'm so scared. Don't worry. That makes two of us. [Allison] Samantha? Debbie? Carrie, where are you? - It's Allison. - Oh, help me! We can't trust it. Please help me! Please! It could be another trick. Allison. [maniacal voice] So, at last we meet face to face, oh, beautiful Trish. Take off that sign you wear around your neck and become a bride of darkness like the others. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but it's not going to be that easy. You dirty, stinking slut. You think you can defy my powers. Call me what you like, but before this night is over I'll see you back in hell where you belong! If you want me, well, just try it. Allison? [squealing] [squealing] [roaring] [ghosts laughing] [roaring] [screeching] [growling] Ahh! Ahh! Ugh! [electrical noises] [maniacal voice] Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! [screaming] Kill! Kill her! Kill her! Kill! - Kill! - [screaming] Kill her! Kill her! Kill! Kill her! Kill her! [screaming] Kill her! Kill! Kill her! Kill. Kill her. [growling] Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. [gas main hissing] Kill her. [hissing] Kill her. [hissing] [hissing] [hissing] Kill her. Kill her. [hissing] Kill her. Kill Trish. Kill her! I the Angel of Darkness will live... forever! [maniacal laughter] [squealing] [squeaking] [echoing voices]
