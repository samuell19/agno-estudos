Hey, let's go! Where are you going? Let's go see the lady who commited suicide. What? - Why? Let's not. Let's just go. - Come on! What the heck! Let's just hang for a while. We'll just take a peek. I heard she's pretty. I heard a woman jumped off a building. Traffic's going to be hell. We won't get a ride home. Why are you so interested in suicide? It's so scary! Pull over. Can I borrow money? I have no salary yet. Is Daisy here? Yes, ma'am. She's in the shower upstairs. Want me to get her for you? Just tell her I'll be waiting at the coffee shop across the street. Okay, ma'am. Sorry for going straight to your house. That's how I do things when I'm hiring. I do a background check on the references. I need to know your living conditions. Not the chatty type, huh? I heard you have a property in Sapang Palay? But it doesn't have a land title, right? Yes, ma'am. I'm renting it out. Left side. Five reps. One. Sound breathing. Two. Open your hand. Three. We're done already. Come up, slowly. Slowly. You came highly recommended by Miss Martha. Thank you for taking the offer. - Excuse me, ma'am. - Thank you. I should be the one to thank you, Ma'am Roxanne. Miss Puffer Fish is fine. It's huge, isn't it? It's huge. Very. That's because there's two of them inside. Miss Martha, you didn't tell her? Miss Martha, I told you to make clear all the details. Ah, I'm good with twins, ma'am. Miss Martha, double her salary, too. Alright. I'll have the contracts updated. Your uniform. That should fit you. You're lucky. You're on the same floor with our masters. Ma'am especially wanted you to be near your ward. I'm a little embarrased. Only wear that within the mansion, okay. I've never worn anything like this in any of my jobs. Then wear it. You haven't been paid this much in all of your jobs. As you say, ma'am. Ma'am's undies are in the bathroom. She wants them handwashed. You know how pregnant women are, especially when it's that big one sneeze and pee comes out. Alright, ma'am. The laundry basket's over there. Hi, Nami! I'm Daisy, your new nanny. Nami, I told you about your new nanny arriving today, yes? Yes, I know. Aren't you going to greet your mom? After I change out of these clothes and wash my hands. Just leave it there. I can dress myself. Alright. Just call me if you need anything. Should I close this? Yes, please. So, Nami. How's your new nanny? She likes me a lot. Did she say that? No. So how did you know? I saw it on her face. Daisy. Eat. Sir and Ma'am aren't going to eat these leftovers. We'll just throw these out. Yeah. You're crazy! Sir is here. Sir, we'll be going. Daddy! She's my new nanny! She likes me a lot. Mrs. Lim recommended her to me. She worked for her for two years while self-supporting in college. Alright, go on upstairs. Tell mommy I'll be right up. Okay, dad! Sir William. My name is Daisy, sir. Good evening. You are important in this house. Like Miss Martha. Send up the red wine. Madam. Were you grumpy all day again? It's difficult to breathe and my tummy is itchy. You're over-exercised, maybe. Will, I need to be healthy for a natural delivery. Well, the doctors say it wouldn't be easy. Of course they'll say that. C-section is faster and more expensive. They will do what I tell them. Are you sure you can do it without anaesthesia? He calls you "madam", then? Okay. Send this up to their room. This time… we're getting twins. I know… and I'm okay. I don't want you to worry. Let's see. I felt them kick earlier. Yeah? Well, I don't know which one of the twins moved. Soon. Very soon. Did you know that Daisy majored in Early Childhood Development in college? But she dropped out. Does that have anything to do with actually raising kids? Well, at least she's fond of kids. I think she'll do well with our kids. Daisy. Nami! Why are you still up? Can you leave the door open? Like this? A little more. That will do. Alright. I'll keep my door open for you from now on. Thank you. Who is playing? The cup. Give this to sir. Where, ma'am? To the master's bedroom? Follow the sound of the piano. The Beethoven sounded nice. I'm glad you liked it. Bye, Dad. Bye, honey. - Bye. - Bye. Breakfast? Yes, please. Let's go have breakfast. Yes, please. I think sir just arrived. I have to clean the bathtub now. Okay, do the pedicure later. Try it. Should I fire Mario already, Will? Since you can drive too, Daisy. You probably know how to use a gun, or self-defense? Then I could fire Pijo, Will's bodyguard. You'll be his bodyguard. Nami, why don't you jump in? Water's too cold. Don't worry, the pool has a heater. Okay then. I got you! The water's not that cold, right? This pool is too small. I've had enough. Huh? Nami. Nami. Let her be. Maybe she's too tired from the trip. Cover yourself already, you might catch a cold. Wait, my phone. Go on inside. There you go. I feel so heavy. It's okay. I feel like a watermelon. It's cold! Okay, go. I'm so heavy. I'll get my phone later. Okay. Take it off already. You sure you want to see the bulge? You know... why... I’m pushing for natural delivery? Because I want six children. Are you sure, hon? I'm happy with three. Only poor people limit the number of their children. The richer you are, the more children you can have. Ouch! Ouch. I told you not to put it in too deep. This isn't working. I'm tired. Can we just sleep? Daisy? Thank you. Ow! Ow! - Sorry, sorry, ma'am Roxanne. - That was too far. Jenny can't sleep. She's been looking out the window and as she looks up at the stars like pretty little Sampaguitas she swears she could hear the voice of Grandma Priming, over and over. Tomorrow, we will visit your mother. Tomorrow, she will finally see her mother-- Nami? Are you asleep? No, I'm listening. Continue. Look at this lady. She looks like you, doesn't she? Hmm... just a little bit. But you know what, I think you're cuter. The next day, Grandma Priming prepared their snacks for the journey. Congratulations to your son, Madam Martha. Thank you, sir. You look tired. Is my wife wearing you down? No, sir. Don't worry. I'll talk to her. Have some. Drink. I'm scared. Just keep going. Don't. Please don't. Stop! Get the check. That's enough. Come on, let's eat. It's getting so big, ma'am. Wow, that's a strong kick. Are you ready to come out? Hello, baby. You'll wake up in the morning and all day you think about how you're going to get through the day. You just take a deep breath and pretend you're a rock. Is it obvious that I’m sick of this job? My mother and I came to work for Ester. She wasn't that wealthy back in the day. But she treats Roxanne like a princess. Some stroke of luck she met William. Now she's living like a queen. So you've been serving under them for a long time, ma'am. Yes. Have you ever had a boyfriend? None yet. Suitors? Someone tried once but that's over now. It's just a waste of time. Really, now? William is such an asshole! He is so horny! This is on you, Martha. Why'd you go bringing in a pretty assistant? I didn't pick her. Your daughter did. I brought in three girls, Roxanne picked Daisy. I don't think Daisy has any idea that she's pregnant. She's childish. Really? Virgin? It won't even cross her mind. I doubt she hatched a plan to get a baby with William. But what do you think will happen? What will she do when she finds out? She won't be much of a bother. She won't make a scene. It's not like her. Well, if she's so innocent why'd she open her legs for William? She's an idiot! You know what, to be honest… You should blame Roxanne because she's the one who likes Daisy. My daughter's no different. Another dum-dum. So innocent. It got me thinking, Martha. What would happen to our children when we're gone? Congratulations. I heard Mateo's a fiscal lawyer now… Does Mateo know that he became a prosecutor through William's connections? Ah, I left that part out. Didn't need to mention it. Anyway. I know you're very proud of your son and you should be proud of yourself, Martha. Wait. What else should I know about? Your boss barged into your room? He was naked and you didn't say a word? I did protest a little. Then he gave me some wine, which I drank. What? Have you lost your mind? No, I just gave in. His looks helped. Life's hard when you're thirsty. Sorry, I have needs. So… How do the rich get it on? This is what came out of his thing. What is this? Shit! That's huge! Really huge! You have no plans of leaving the mansion? Nope. Aren't you awkward with his wife? I don't mind it. It's done and over with. But something did happen. You can't change that. Ma, why did you make Daisy clean the house? You told me she knows a lot of skills so I had everything waxed up to the chandelier. Besides, it's dusty in here. It's bad for you, remember? Son of a bitch. Oh my god! Can you help me please? Mom! Do something! Do something! Help me, please! Oh my god! The patient only suffered a mild concussion but she feels some pain in her hip area so we need to run some tests. From what height did she fall? Second floor? She's pregnant. Do you know who the father is? Is it Will? Mom, are you sure? I'm one hundred percent sure. Thanks to Martha. Yes, Martha? She has a slight concussion. Bruised pelvis. She has to rest. Two days. That's not what I want to know. The doctor didn't mention anything. Daisy's hardy. No bleeding. Martha, maybe it's you who made a mistake? Strap that girl down, okay? And get back here. I have something for her. Okay. Your husband's going on a business trip, yes? Yes. He'll be in Taipei for four days. Good. I'll iron things out before he gets back. Mom… Please, can you just leave me alone? You wanted a wealthy husband. This is part of the contract so bear with it. So what do you want me to do? Pretend that I know nothing? Exactly. You're not completely clueless. Is this ward two? Yes, ma'am. Madam Ester wishes to ask for your forgiveness. She says to get some rest. Don't think about work for now. That must be heavy. Did you carry it all the way from the parking lot? Here. It's a cheque. She wants you to have it. A consolation. You probably realized by now that for our employers, everything is easy. They just throw money at it and all their problems are gone. It takes them no effort. But for us, it's a decent trade-off. Focus on getting better. Martha. Ester. Miss Martha, do you think I'm still the same little squirt you looked after? No, ma'am. That's right. So? Why are you spreading rumours about my husband to other people without my knowledge? What am I to you? Mom… Ma'am, it won't happen again, …ma'am Roxanne. Hi. William, you're home early? Ah, your daughter texted me and told me you're here so I ran home. How are you? That's sweet of you. What else did she say? Nothing in particular, why? Am I missing something? No. Thank you for coming home early. Surprising. My wife's being extra sweet tonight. Mommy... You must be the reason so maybe we should do this more often. I was thinking the same thing. I don't see your assistant hanging around. I brought her to the hospital because she had a high fever. - Just now? - Mhm. What did the doctor say? Probably just exhaustion. She will stay there overnight? She'll be back in tomorrow. Miss Martha! You're taking a while in there. Aren't you done packing? Why is that? Getting old, are you? You should resign, then. Roxanne, you little bitch. I raised you. Your goddamned mother promised me all sorts of things. "We're like sisters!" "I'll take care of you!" Here I am, 31 years, a maid. I am a mother of a prosecutor of the Republic of the Philippines! Here I am. You sons of bitches. You damn rich folk. You'll have your reckoning. You can't buy everything. No. Look what you did to me. You robbed me of my life. I took care of you! All of you! Did all you asked! Assholes! Screw all of you! How dare you! Screw all of you! Shit! Shit! Just because you're rich I did everything for you as your maid for 31 years... a maid. Screw you, you're going to get what you deserve. You can't have all the good days. Shit! I won't let it happen. Screw you! Screw all of you! Ah, we didn't notice it right away. Look at this. That's the fertilized egg in your womb. It's only been four weeks. Is it your first baby? It's a blessing. Don't be scared. So is your boss responsible? Your savings blew up all of a sudden. Who knew you'd be spending it all on your baby? It's a good thing you have cash set aside. But hold on a minute, if your boss is the father, he should shoulder everything! Have you ever aborted a baby? Ugh, Jesus! Pack your things and get out of that mansion. And then what? Sort out what to do with your newborn later. Don't worry. I'll help you. I'll help you. Daisy knows she's pregnant. That bitch. What did my husband ever see in her? Just a cheap maid. I wish this house had a third floor. I'm furious. This will keep your body healthy and the baby, too. Make sure your employers don't see this. Thank you. I'm sorry, Daisy. I didn't watch where I was going. I didn't dream this would happen. You know I didn't mean to do it, yes? Nami's milk? No, ma'am. My friend just gave it to me. This is Gina. Hello, ma'am. It's good for your body. I should have bought it for you. Ah, it's alright, ma'am. I'll feel better in no time. Daisy! I'm late for work. Bye. I'll go ahead. Martha. Finish your milk. When you've drank all of it, let us know Martha will buy more for you. I feel different in this house. Because sir's not around? That's not what I meant, ma'am. I just feel off. I don't feel comfortable anymore. I feel like maybe I should quit. Then quit. Tomorrow. But I don't have a replacement yet. Say goodbye to Roxanne. I'll take care of the rest. What if I just cast her out? What if after three to four years she comes with the baby? As long as she carries evidence of William's betrayal, You'll never stop thinking of her. What will I do, Ma? Ma'am Roxanne, Daisy would like to say something. Sit down. What is it? I would like to resign, ma'am. I'm afraid my body isn't able to stand the work here. I treated you like my own family and you do this to me? I'll get the food ready-- Stay there! I'm so sorry, ma'am. Why are you saying sorry? Did you do something? Mom? I'll go straight to the point. How much for your womb in exchange for that thing inside your tummy? Two million? Three million? Just get rid of that thing as soon as possible and I don't want to see your face here ever again! In two days... I'll give birth, and by the time I get back, I want your baby gone from your womb. Daisy. I did a terrible thing. I wish I thought of ma'am. You idiot! It's sir who should have thought of ma'am. I wonder how they found out that I’m pregnant? Did the hospital tell them? That's not allowed, is it? Accept whatever they're offering ask for more, even. They won't refuse you. Do you want to keep the baby? I haven't thought about what to do. Well, you should start thinking. You only have today, tomorrow, and the next. Sorry, ma'am. Why are you apologizing to me?! Why are you letting them do that to you? I'm sorry. Don't apologize to me! Think of a plan! Don't let them treat you like that! Fight back! Don't be such an idiot! Don't let them walk all over you! Make a move! You idiot! Idiot! Mom, I don't believe she'll get rid of the baby. She was too affectionate towards my twins and even to Nami, she's very maternal. Daisy… Why are you still up? Go ahead and sleep, I'll watch over you. Why would you watch over me? Alright. I'll just finish my milk, okay? Daisy... I'm sorry. Why are you saying sorry? Because grandma pushed the ladder that's why you fell off. Wasn't that an accident? No. She did it on purpose. I saw and heard them. Oh shit. Mom, what did you do? You don't know anything about this. You're a good person, Daisy. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. Thank you, Nami. Miss Martha. About Daisy- I don't want her on the second floor anymore. Move her to your room so you can keep an eye on her. Okay. You're moving to a different room? Because your new nanny's coming over soon. But why? Are you ill? No. But I have a baby in my tummy now. Really? Boy or girl? I hope it's a girl. Like you. She must still be so tiny, huh? - Nami… - Nami, we're leaving. Your grandma's calling for you. Yes, we're going to the hospital. Mommy's going to give birth today, I think. I'll finally see the twins. Oh yeah? Alright, then. Take care. I can't watch over you now but no matter you're with Miss Martha. I don't have to worry. Bye, Nami. Bye, Daisy. Nami. Where were you, huh? I just said goodbye to Daisy. Martha, keep an eye on Daisy. She might forget our agreement. Good morning, Mr. Romero. This way, please. Hi. Nice to see you, mommy. I'm glad you could be here despite your busy schedule. Go see your baby. Go on. Don’t play with that. It's not a toy. Miss Martha. I won't get rid of my baby. Then don't. Ester. Rip that cheque in half. She's keeping the baby. Shit! That witch! I should have just poisoned her. Ready, please. Is it okay? One, two, three, smile! Give me that, go get the babies. How are you? Thank you for giving me two beautiful sons. I love you, honey. Have your rest. He's an asshole. That's enough. Wine, sir? I don't need anything. That bitch! I can't believe she did that to me. Oops. What are you doing in there? Want to join me? Suit yourself. Are the babies out? What is your problem? I'm pregnant. But, madam Ester and madam Roxanne knew before I did. They offered me three million to get an abortion but I don't want it. I don't want to lose our baby Hey! What do you think you're doing? Get out of there. You shameless girl. I know you don't treat me like a human being, but this baby is yours. No! No, baby, please. Please, no! What kind of milk is this? Maternal milk. My friend bought it for me. You know what, I'll just disappear and it will all be over. Me and my baby. I don't need your money. But you know that you're the father, and this is your child too! Daisy… Let's have the baby. Okay? Thank you, sir. But I'm sorry you had a baby with someone like me. She was writhing in pain earlier, so I gave her a strong sedative. That's good. William's seed is on a different level. Alright. Thank you, doctor! Martha. Pack her things. She's not coming back here. Okay, Ester. William is asking for you. Me? He wants to see me? Yes. Why, has he seen Daisy? Unfortunately, yes. Is the baby dead? Your maid is somewhat of a slut, isn't she? I heard she was pregnant when she was brought in. What's it to you? Mommy, I'm the one asking questions. Just answer them. She told me that I'm the baby's father. She said that? She just wants your money. If it's not mine, then why go through all the trouble? Were you the one who put Cytotec in her milk? No. Then who? Your daughter? No. It was me. How dare you think you could pull that off? Did you think that because it's not my child with Roxanne, that I wouldn't accept the baby as my own? Is that what you think? William brought the milk to the lab. It's been mixed with a drug that induces abortion. Who would do that? Roxanne. Those people are terrible. It's scary. Probably why they got so rich. Nami told me, that her grandmother pushed me off the second floor on purpose. Kids don't lie. But I wasn't aware that I was pregnant at the time. I was. I know everything that goes on in that mansion. Even the first time William used you, and all the succeeding times, I knew. Even before you leave this hospital, they've come up with a dozen plans, on how to deal with you. Take this. Get as far away from here as you can. Find someone who will love you. All of this nightmare shall pass, too. I want to take revenge! Do it. Get back at them. Why? Don't tell me that you miss them? Kill that thought. Don't torture yourself. Forget about them. Let's go to sleep. Go to sleep. Nami, she's the only one I miss. With her, I felt how good it must be to be a mother. Don't let them treat you like that. Fight back! Don't be such an idiot! Don't let them walk all over you! Make a move! We haven't done this for ages. Your feet are dirty. You're dirty. How many times do I have to apologize for you to remember that I'm still your husband? Suck it up. Do whatever you want. Just tell me, when you want another baby. Triplets next time? Daisy. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I'm just nursing your baby. Give him to me. Please. Don't hurt the baby. Me? Hurt a child? Stupid! Baby… Give him here. Baby… Give me my baby. Hand him over, please. I said hand him over. Sorry, baby. Please, hand me the baby. You can leave now. Get out! Yes, I'm leaving! You're tough, huh? What now? Honey! Honey! Who let that woman in? Is she still here? Roxanne. I don't feel so good. I have a bad feeling about this. We need to call the police. Miss Martha, Cast that woman away, If you can't do it alone, call for Pijo, or Mario. You do it. I'm leaving, too. Resigning. Martha. What is this bullshit? How dare you? Get that madwoman out of here before you leave. I'll call for Mario and Pijo, ma'am. Shut up! Martha… Why are you doing this? After everything I've done for you and your son, this is how you repay us? It's not enough. William. It's not enough. Considering how long I've been working for you. It's not enough. And did you think, I meant to keep serving you until I die? I can't take it anymore. I am done putting up with you. You may be swimming in cash, but you are shameless people. Soulless. Wretched beasts. Daisy! Daisy! Nami! How are you? I'm okay. What about you? How are you? I'm alright. Are you happy with your baby brothers? They look like angels, don't they? What about the baby inside your tummy? My baby? It's gone. Huh? But why? Why don't you ask your Daddy? You shut up! Shut up! Crazy woman! Daisy, let's go. Daisy. Thank you, but I can't forget everything that happened to me in this house! Daisy. Forgive me for all the sins we commited against you. You should have just ran with the money. What more do you want me to do, so you can let the matter rest? Daisy, please. Don't drag my children into this. They didn't do anything wrong. Please. No more. Nami. I'm sorry. Happy birthday, Nami! Happy birthday, Nami! Cheers! Happy birthday, dear Nami! Happy birthday, to you!
