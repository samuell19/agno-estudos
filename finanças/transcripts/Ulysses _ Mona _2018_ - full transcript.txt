ULYSSES & MONA You could be more honest. Excuse me? His dick. It's out of proportion with his arms. It doesn't flatter him and isn't very honest. You're going too fast, Camille. Take the time to consider his body as a whole. You focus too much on the details. Very good, Mona. Sensitive, inspired. Made any progress on my question? I'm not sure we should have a child so soon. So, did you get his deets? I should have them by Wednesday. Shit, the bus! See you tomorrow! Another day spent. Vladimir still looks like Vladimir. My town still looks like my town. My neighbor still looks like my neighbor. Ulysses' Goodbye - Hi Dracula, hi Joseph. - Hi Arthur. No school today? Never on Wednesdays. You do realize this is private property? You do realize it used to belong to my family? What's up with the gun? Planning to shoot me? I don't know, I grabbed it without thinking. Sometimes I act without thinking. Did you see a weird light in the sky last night around 11 pm? Kids your age should be asleep by then. I'm an insomniac. Is something wrong? I don't know. I'm ok now. Boris? Hey there, Ulysses! All alone? Yeah. I'll have to tell you. Seriously Ulysses, I feel like such an idiot without her. What'd we do to make them leave us? I'm the one who left Alice. You forgot? No, you're right. You were an even bigger idiot. Can I tell you something, no offense? Go ahead. Last night I couldn't sleep because of Sylvie. Know what I did? No. I started thinking about you. And you know what? It put things in perspective. I thought, I don't have it as bad as Ulysses. He was at the top and came crashing down all at once. I was never at the top, but... I was fairly happy up until now. It's true, right? You were a renowned artist. You had a wife every man dreams of having. A great son. And you threw it all away. All to end up alone in a manor in ruins. Talking to you did me a world of good. I feel much better. Stronger, more combative. I'm glad. I'm glad. The mosaics of St. Demetrius are in fact panels placed side by side, covering the walls of the church. The faithful came by the thousands to pray to the Saint. These panels are ex-votos, all depicting the Saint surrounded by what we might call "his clients." The art of these panels... Eyes closed, hand out. You can look now. Couldn't find a phone number, but the address is correct. Thanks. You're welcome. Having a cop for a dad has its perks. - How'd you do it? - I gave him my dealer's number. Really? Course not! Professional secret. - Don't reveal your sources. - I won't. - Can I buy you a drink? - If you insist. Keep going straight, 300 meters... Shit. Did you do that? My aunt bought me this thing. Not my fault. Do you know how to get to the manor? Keep straight for now. Going to see Dracula? Dracula? That's what I call him because of the manor. Are you his daughter? No. My name is Arthur. I'm Mona. You're not a great driver. I never drive. I hate it. This is my mom's car. Park over there. It's down that path. Straight through the woods. I'll come along if you want. I always like to see Dracula. What the heck is he doing? Playing tennis. Against a machine? He's alone. How else could he play tennis? Do you know him well? I know the artist. Dracula is an artist? - I've got to go. - You do? See you around, Mona. Sorry about the paint. Ulysses Borelli? How'd you get here? Arthur brought me. I'm an art student. I admire your work. Go away. Let me explain... Go on, scram. I don't know how you found me, but don't ever come back. He plays tennis with a machine that spits out balls. How depressing. Did you talk to him? I tried, he wouldn't let me. I don't see why you're interested in him. Jealous? Obviously. You really want to be his assistant? I need to learn. I gotta go back, it's the only way. I'll go back with selling points. Shit, where was it? Ulysses Borelli! Arthur! Arthur! What were you doing? - I was just... - What happened? I have no idea! You must've passed out! I found you here. You're losing blood. I'll take you to the hospital. It's nothing, I'll be fine. I'm going home. I'm parked down there. Are you ok, can you walk? Come in. You again? I wanted to make sure you were ok. What happened? What'd they say? Nothing yet. Maybe you're playing too much tennis? For my age, you mean? No. Well... Are they keeping you? They want to run some tests. Why'd you come back today? I think I'm getting attached to you. Get some rest. Why are you wearing a tennis dress? I'll be back tomorrow. No need. Hello, Mr. Borelli. - Hello, Doctor. - Have a seat. I called you in because we've got the results of the tests we ran on you. The scan revealed a malignant tumor. That explains your recent dizzy spells. See this spot here? Or here? Actually, they're the same. Mr. Borelli, we need to... What are you doing? Mr. Borelli? Don't touch me! Don't touch me. What's your name? I'll get changed. If you want a drink, help yourself. Did you paint this? It's the only painting I kept. Then I quit painting. What happened to you? I fell while playing tennis. What do you want, Arthur? I saw Mona's car parked outside, so I thought... Hi, Arthur. Hey, hi! When they come, we'll have to decide. Stay, or leave earth. We'd miss some things. Walking in the forest, the blue sky, swimming in the river, a nice warm fire. But on the other hand, we'd live forever. We'd learn telepathy. We'd travel at the speed of light. Whatever happens, I'll be there to greet them. The first contact is the most important. What if they met an unfriendly person? They'd leave immediately and never come back, for sure. What time is it? 11:15! They'll kill me! Thanks Mona, thanks Dracula. I had a lovely night. Is he always like that? Always. Why are you interested in me? No one is anymore. Well, I am. For what reason? You really want to know? Go ahead, try me. I'm interested in you because I'm tired of naked men, fruit in bowls, Byzantine paintings. I want to do what you succeeded in doing. I want to turn my life into beautiful art. I want to be your assistant. I no longer work. I quit, you know. You should start again, I'll help you. I can do mock-ups, research. I can carry the heavy stuff. Make films, take pictures. We've both had too much to drink. You shouldn't drive. I'll prepare a room for you. What are you doing here? If I make the rules, and you ask no questions, will you still assist me? Yes. If you agree, we'll start tomorrow morning. I agree. Go ahead. Are we rolling? Yes. It's recording. I remember the wind blowing outside. What? Antoine, please. I can't do this if you interrupt me. I remember the wind blowing outside. How cold the house was. I remember you getting up and telling Dad you were leaving. Stop this right now. What? What is this circus? Take off that mask. It's ridiculous. That's better. I'm listening now. You told Dad you were leaving because you could no longer live in this house. You felt alone and misunderstood And you loved that boy. Then you turned to me, looked at me, and asked me for help. And I... I lowered my eyes like a coward. I should've protected you. I should've asked Mom to intervene. She and I should've told him we wanted you to stay with us. You got your bag, packed and ready, from your bedroom. You came back down. But you didn't look at us again. Not Dad, not Mom, not even me. You opened the door and left. Slowly. I remember how long it took. Maybe you hoped we'd hold you back. We didn't move. We acted as though nothing had happened. I thought of you walking in the cold. I found you courageous. I would never have been so brave, I was a coward. And easily influenced. Why didn't you say this before? I wasn't capable. So why now? I wanted to apologize. I have to go, Antoine. Wait, Ulysses. Will you call me again? You may go home now. That's all for today. If you're willing, I'll need you tomorrow. Ok. Write down your address before you go. I'll pick you up outside tomorrow, at 7 am. - Can you be away for two days? - Sure. Good. You could've done it without me. Just turned on the camera. I hate those things. I'm always afraid I'll accidentally erase everything. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Ah, hello Ulysses! This is a terrible time. What happened to you? I fell down the stairs trying to catch the neighbor's cat. Joseph can't stand him anymore. - Going out? - Yeah. Sylvie called me. She wants to see me. How's my outfit? Is it too... You might want to remove the tie. You're right. I'm dropping off my keys. I'll be away two days. Would you mind feeding Joseph? No problem. Where are you going? To get some air. - Good luck with your date. - Thanks. Ulysses? Do you think I should say something like... "My life has no meaning without you?" Keep it simple. Don't worry, you'll be back tomorrow night. I'm not worried. I know how to use a camera. Sometimes we need someone to encourage us, you understand? Yeah, I think so. I'm going to the restroom. What the fuck are you doing here? I was using the toilet. I suppose you're planning to rob the place? This is my first time, I've never stolen a thing. It may seem strange, but I've always respected the law. I was a nurse in a maternity ward. You were? Yes, but the maternity ward closed. Not profitable enough. So I lost my job. I have to pay rent and child support. I have my child half the time, his mother has him the other half. He's a great kid. I have to find a way, you understand? I understand. Holy shit. I don't think I can do it. It's obvious it's plastic, isn't it? No, it's realistic. Really, you think so? It's my kid's. What do we do now? I don't know. Do you have an idea? Give me all your money, please. No can do. Excuse me? No. What do you mean, no? No. I can't do that. Why not? Because if I do, I'll be fired. And if I get fired, I'll have to find another job. No one will want me. Especially these days. Work is scarce, especially for mugs like mine. As you can no doubt imagine. This is an unusual situation. A life is at stake. I can't do this to him. - What are you doing? - I know you. I thought it was you, but with your head down I wasn't sure. I live in the projects over there. You too, right? - Rue Stendhal. - Right, I know the one. My street is perpendicular to it. Ok. If the hostage crisis is over, we'll be leaving. Come, Mona. Your receipt, sir. Thank you. Thank you. So... I'll be leaving too. May I? See you soon. Want a ride home? No, I live right nearby, there's no need. Thanks. Goodbye. Have a safe trip. You too. I'm sure everything will be alright. Wait! Here. It's all I have on me. Thank you. Thank you. Why did you tell him that? What? That everything will be alright. I wanted to encourage him. What should I have said? The truth. What truth? Do you know the truth? I can imagine it. That's my son, Nicolas. Which one? The one who looks sad. What're you doing here? I want to talk to you. I'm working. It won't be long. Go sit upstairs. I'll be right there. So who are you? She's my assistant. What'd you do to yourself? I was lost in thought. I walked into a glass door. Typical. So, how are you doing? How am I doing? Do you care? Listen, I don't know why the fuck you and your assistant came, but I have no desire to talk to you. It's indecent to show up after two years with no news. So you two will now leave the way you came. And I will resume my shitty job making pizzas, and go back to my life as a son whose father left him. Don't let me keep you. I'll be right back. I lost my father when I was twelve. He was a strange guy, but I loved him. I think of him every morning. I wonder how he would have aged, how it would've been to grow up with him alive. Would I have been different? More sure of myself? I don't know your father well. But I'm not sure he deserves this. I dropped my cell phone under the table. We're staying the night here. I reserved two rooms. Ok. Ever see the film The Swimmer ? You should see it. It's the story of a guy who decides to swim home, using every swimming pool he finds along the way. Burt Lancaster plays the guy. Got no pool? No. Too bad. So this is where you live? It looks a bit like our old house. I feel almost nostalgic. "Ruins call to mind monumental truths. Everything is obliterated. Everything perishes. Everything passes." You don't seem so afraid. Afraid of what? Afraid of dying. Is that you ringing? Missed call Would you like to go for a drink? I know an interesting place nearby. We can walk there. The Last Refuge Do you prefer the birth of love Or decay and decline Do you prefer sucking at everything Or digging your life Do you prefer a polyester tie Or a suburban vibe Do you prefer big families Or militant vegans Would you rather be a radical Islamist Or a guy named Kevin Would you rather know the truth Or have bangs Would you rather get shingles Or wear bermuda shorts Would you rather run in the desert Or fly in your mind Would you rather dance to life Or die to music... Do you have a boyfriend, Mona? You're nosy. So? So... no. Be careful. Of what? Of staying alone too long. Coming from a guy who plays tennis with a robot! I like it when you smile. You don't smile enough. It's a shame. Maybe we can be friends. If you like. Another round. Nicolas left me a message. Yeah? What'd he say? He wanted to apologize. He asked to see me again. I abandoned them all. My brother, my son... Alice. Who's Alice? Nicolas' mother. Another round, please. Tomorrow I'll go see Alice. Then I'll be done. Everything will be alright, I'm sure. I shouldn't have said that. Why not? You scolded me for saying that to the guy at the gas station. We are the movement Of the organ grinder Steady and precise We leave pieces of ourselves behind We find them up ahead So you like me, Ulysses? Come. - No. - Come dance with me. Please. What are you doing? We should go now. - What do I owe you? - 55 euros. Big spender. What? I said big spender. How much is she? Get out. Get out, right now! Stop, Ludo. Let it go! - Where'd they go? - They left, drop it. No one's ever fought for me. I've never fought for anyone. Get back inside. I don't like young guys. Guys my age are too stupid. They're old. Young is the new old. We'd be great together. I wouldn't even ask you for a baby. I don't give a shit. You're handsome even when you don't smile. Got your keys? Will you stay a while? No. You need to sleep now. Will you be ok? When I was 16 I was totally in love. His name was Emile. It lasted a year and a half. I made love for the first time with him. We saw each other every day, made crazy plans. Then he broke up with me in a text. I didn't see it coming. The day before, he'd kissed me like the first time. Know what he wrote in the text? No. "I'll never forget our time together. But life is short. I want to have other loves." I want to have other loves... Do you still love Alice? Goodnight, Mona. Goodnight, Ulysses. I'd rather you stay here. Ok. Hello. I was wondering if you'd seen my dog. I was walking him by the lake and he suddenly took off. No, sorry. Just thought I'd ask. Thanks for your help. What kind of dog is he? A Labrador. A unique one, with a strong personality. He can be moody, but he's generous at heart. His fur is short and sandy-colored. It's lighter around his eyes, giving him a profound expression. Extremely profound. He seems to read our thoughts. Joseph is like no other dog. We've been together eleven years. You could leave me your number. You never know, I might see him. I don't want to be a bother. It's no bother at all. Come in. No, I have to be going. I'll drop by again. You never know. - Was that her new... - I imagine so. Who's the girl in the car? - We work together. - You're working again? More or less. I stopped by the house. I met your boyfriend. - Been together long? - Nearly a year. I made up a bunch of nonsense. I couldn't tell him who I was. I mean, with relation to you. He seems nice. Athletic and all. Nicolas said you went to see him. - Did he say anything else? - Just that. What are these visits about? Is it a pilgrimage? Are you seeking forgiveness? For being selfish? And cruel? And full of anger? Anything you like. We could've grown old together. You owed me that much. If you asked me, I'd come back. You'd leave him? You taught me it's possible to leave without warning. That was different. But we still loved each other, didn't we? I believe so. Alice... I have something important to tell you. Shit... Oh my gosh, I'm sorry! I didn't see you. Let me help you up. Are you hurt? No, I'm ok. Are you with the guy who lost his dog? Yes. Where is he? Is he with Alice? Alice? The woman from that car. What are they doing? She's helping him... look for the dog. I'll go see if I can help too. - Wait! - What? You shouldn't go. Why not? The dog. What about him? He's dangerous. -Dangerous? -Yes. I thought he was so unique! Shit! I'll take you home. I don't feel much like going home. Where shall I drop you off? Can I stay with you and Joseph tonight? Are you Ulysses Borelli? Yes I am. We'd like to ask you a few questions. What about? About little Arthur. He's gone missing. His parents alerted us last night. He didn't come home. We know he spent Thursday evening here. - Is that correct? - Yes. Was it the first time you'd invited Arthur to dinner? Yes. Do you know him well? We often see each other around here. So that night, you invited him to stay for dinner? He knocked on the door and I invited him to join us. You were here, too? Yes. During dinner, did he act strange in any way? Did he mention any plans to run away? No. He was waiting for the extraterrestrials. Excuse me? He was waiting for them to land so he could be first to greet them. The extraterrestrials? I'm sorry about last night. I was super drunk. No need to apologize. Thank you, Ulysses. For what? For trusting me. We can't pretend nothing's wrong, sorry. You can't ask us to leave you alone. Hi, Dad. Come in. What do you mean you can't pretend nothing's wrong? I didn't tell you the whole truth, Mona. What are you saying? I have a brain tumor. I have a brain tumor. I can say it now. Mona! Mona... Why didn't you tell me? We didn't know each other. You don't tell strangers such things. I couldn't even tell my son. I'm a stranger to you? No. Not anymore. Why get to know each other only to... Only to... Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Captain! Captain! He's alive. Mr. Borelli? So, you've come back? You've decided to get treatment? Dracula? What are you doing here? You woke up? Can you tell me how we both got here? I asked for a room close to yours. We found you in a ravine, two days ago. I remember now. I was joining them. Who? The extraterrestrials. No one was there to greet them. So what happened to you? Is it your head again? What are you doing here? I've been waiting for you. You went missing on us. I was worried about you.
