Joseph, asked me, Let us see the tablets. It's not Melarsoprol. He says these pills are better, because they are bigger. Oh my god. And where did Melarsoprol stay? Dear colleagues, a few things we need to clarify. The tablets can not walk. I'm sorry, Doctor. We have too little nurses. When he did, I told him immediately gave penicillin, but knees probably we will not tell. Penicillin is running out of us. Running out of penicillin? Can you walk? ... dr. Albert Schweitzer, a renowned artist, Humanity and theologian. Listen to the horn the cathedral in Küln. Did I hear the doctor? Doctor? Doctor? Mhm. Doctor! Quick! You're on the radio! Ugwu!

On behalf of all patients from Lambarena, I thank you. I want you to see them. Such a small paper they often decide about life and death. You are a versatile man. Theologian, musician philosopher, doctor ... You can tell us, how are you doing all this? Ah, there's everything going one with another. With a book about Jesus I have been purging church scholars. I'm a book about Bach I've been pushing all the musicians. That's how it stays Only medicine. How long will it be? Do you work in the hospital, Doctor? It's better to ask my question. It has a better memory. Lene? We are the first departed in 1913. But she interrupted us World War I. Later we returned, with your kind support. We are working now since 1924. I'm going to visit, I'll just be able to. But I am afraid that it will be possible stayed there forever. Oh, look, who I see! Big friend Albert! Come on, come on! Einstein? That Communist? Talk about big people ... It's really the biggest here in the world. Professor Albert Einstein. A great thinker, a great humanist. I am very happy, that we are friends. Doctor. Doctor! Can I take a picture of you? The two greatest people in the world? You do not have anything against, Professor Einstein? I'm afraid it will hurt my friend. What do you mean? Society with a dangerous communist as they publicize me in public, can affect on the success of his work. This is the greatest nonsense! Is that true, Doctor? - Ah, we both know, what's happening in heads of politicians. Take pictures, Mrs Bourdin. Will he come to the hotel? We will be glad you are. I have unpleasant moments all these events. They are. They like to have a circus. Do not think about it. What do we have, Lene? No meetings. Just dinner with the committee. Is that so. No speeches. Well yes. Something will happen I had to tell you. How nice she was little girl, is not it? It was not so small. It seemed to me as developed. Not the one! I thought a little girl. A! Even a bigger girl she was friendly. Photographer. By the way, we gotta go to the studio tomorrow on official photography. Officially photographed? We'll get it all together enough money? We'll get it all together enough money? I mean an orphan Mink and poor youth. Much work is waiting for us. You're coming with me in Gwnsbach? That's what I promised. Your promises often They do not, Albert. Do not start again with that, Lene. Of course I would he saw Rhene and his grandchildren. It may seem like I have a skin like a hippo, and my heart is meek like a dove. Hm ... You know, I'm mistaken. I did not say, not to be mistaken. Oh! Welcome! I interrupted you, Helen? I'm ... - Ah, no. Albert! Albert! Albert! Sit down. I only shave shoes. You do not bother. You have something against, Will I be seated? It does not bother, because you see that we are all trained. - When you're right there, I have reason, to open this drink. But, to change me with you? Did you know? No! Really? Then I suggest agreement. I'll sign your works and I will be quick to everyone, You take the campaign against an atomic bomb. Deal. I'm terrified to be popular around the world. No, I will not. No ... Cheers two Albert's. Drink it. Seriously, Albert, your help could be used. Not again Shut up with that one. Do business ... Good knowing how you are with I'm studying Oppenheimer. But this is not my area. I'm not an expert. Albert, it is clear, I'm on your side. I know we have to be careful with politics. Support from America is ... - I understand. Believe me, to do with these hypocrites you never know. CIA Central Intelligence Agency What does this have with intelligence? Now they are very busy by opening your home and listening McCanthy ordered them. They are very worried, as they say, anti-amber activities. I'm counting on Hiroshi is one of the activities, to which it is America is proud. I do not know if you can invest the problems of the whole world. But a bomb! Also bomb tests! Kat, what's your name? Communion, respect ... Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben, Albert! Commitment to life. That's what I thought, I could only speak Add these things to me. They can not take you passport. You're a foreign citizen. I'll think about it. I will. On the respect of life. They are in Africa met? No. In Alsace. We met as a student. All the girls looked after him. For God's sake, Lene, Leave my secrets, please. I had the luck, that I could help him. When he wrote, I told him corrected errors, Translated ... Bugs? It was a real nightmare! She scribbled the items, with whom she disagreed. Oh, Albert, I always gave you the right one. What sort of things are they? they almost certainly agreed. I think that about this, that books are not enough. Was it, Albert? I do not know very well. We wanted to do something concrete. Something different, which would change the lives of people. Yeah. - But I must say, I have always wondered, If it is right to change this, in which people believe. Religious beliefs too and philosophy. I met my thoughts important people, Aristotle, John Stuart Milla, Immanuel Kanta ... Me. - Helene Schweitzer. Yeah. Yeah. - I've been doing this for 40 years. Has something changed? Not much. We may be a few mitigate the suffering of lepers and gave them something Complaints. BOLNI NICA LAMBARENE The first hospital was Similar balls. Chinua! Eimer! Come on quickly! Chinua! Gospodična Therese, what have you done, that it became so talkative? Now you are in line, dr. Schweitzer. Goodbye tomorrow. - With pleasure, if only you can. You always welcome us. We have Lambaren small generator. It's actually quite large, and it produces just so much electricity, to power the barge, similar to that in your car. They're watching the disease other. They're revolting. They had healers, which are the treatment of the soul and the body so you master it, that we flushed in front of them. They're your own bili mote i. Thus, there were conflicts, which we did not always say well. It will get better. There's an attack. Chloroform, Lene, chloroform. They believed the disease cause the kidneys in the body. This is his wife, Daba. We need these dead bodies exterminate, Daba. Do not cut! Do not cut! Ogango will curse him! Oganga means home therapist. We'll cut, Dab. We need to remove the rve. Mhm. - Good. N'Zeng. N'Zeng, wake up! Wake up! The pain was over. Good! Joseph! Bring his wound up! N'Zeng. N'Zeng! PoZasi, N'Zeng! N'Zeng! Oganga! Oganga. Oganga! He is not Ogang! I'm Oganga! Oganga drove Dabo out, to punish her for its incomprehensibility. We were afraid, that he would do us something, but he calmed down. He just wanted to show. Because of the inconvenience ... will die! Oganga is cursing you! Daba! She will not die. Look at me! This man can not stand over you! Look at me! Daba. Daba! The next day they're a little away called her dead body and next to her dead child. Your thoughts, that you will never succeed. There are so many things, which they can not understand. But that's the way it is Life. Yeah. It's life. Do you know that the Americans do not you really know how to make coffee? During the war, we lost that way Our little hospital. Because they declared us in Germany the sovereign of the state, the French drove us to the internment in the Pyrenees, where I got sick for tuberculosis. Nevertheless, it was good, that we were together. Then she came to the world our little hhi Rhena, who is now old 4 years. Me? Sorry, I'm breaking up, Mrs Schweitzer, I'm interested in why so few Think about your family. In what way? I do not mean prison, but I read in the magazine, that dr. Schweitzer connected with communist youth from the New Part of Germany. It also writes, to greet brotherly with the people of the new word. So ... it does not seem to you, that this is dangerous? It's mine brotherly greeting with people from all over the world. This does not mean, to agree with their thinking. But he is really inclined to be an ancient one the idea of ​​fraternity. I think that it's not very dangerous. What about you? I'm rarely going shopping. What it means the name of Lambarena? In the local language means: It's worth a try. Today, it's not you, but a small town. Thank you, good people. Dr. Schweitzer! You will be late. Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. It was on the river. Beautiful morning. We were in school together and assistant Joseph. I told Joseph, that it was in the First World War They've already died in one battle 30,000 people. He said he was I'm crazy from him, because it's naive native. No place in the world he can not pay damages for so many dead, as is customary in Gabon. Odškodnina for every devil! He was right. How are you people? They understand the war. They know only the mysteries of life. And its value. And the fact that life is the only, what we have. Then we're on the river watching crocodiles, and the butterfly on it, Nile horses, mosquitoes and small animals in the grass, which were before us. Slowly, woods ants ... Yeah, that's what they were eating from children's picture books. It seemed to me, that they are interconnected. Eda drugi takes life. However, no creature takes more, as a lifestyle. The only man. The only man. I wrote on a paper The four German words. I'm still here German, you understand. These words were: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben. In translation I would meant: respect for life. This is the meaning of life. Yeah. Commitment to life. It also applies to The life of the enemies. It's curiously interesting, dr. Schweitzer, but whether this is not the case your emphasis on brotherhood only propaganda for your communist ideas? That's right! - This is not the same thing, as with your friend, Professor Einstein, which is a member of many suspicious organizations: Friends of the Chinese people, The US-Soviet Council friendship, Committee to visit Russian delegations, The elimination committee Commission for anti-amber action, American Commission for the freedom of Spain, - Let's get out of here, please. Friends of the Brigadier Abraham Lincoln. Let me go! Let's go, Dr. Schweitzer. - What about my lecture? Let's go. As you can see, asi are restless. You do not have to maybe happen. Such a failure do not remember. Excuse me. I do not want to disturb you, ho em re i, ... That's terrible. Maybe you can what am I doing? I do not understand. In what way? I can not stand this behavior. I'm totally upset. Oh, do not worry. They'll take care of him. Of course, I think ... It's all funny. Can we say a few words? You can. The thing is ... Oh, excuse me, Figgis, Phil Figgis. Therese Bourdin. Hm! Frenchman? - Some species. Well, anyway, Miss Bourdin. Even life ... I'm a big observer dr. Schweitzer. I read all his works. I'm not an academician I'm not even bored, I only know the piano on 4 fingers. I'm sorry his principles, his commitment and even as a personality. I'm following the week his lecture and ... also you I'm sort of pursuing. I envy you your work. You are so close to him, You can chat with him ... and everything so discreet. - But ... I know, I know. What's the matter with you? Yeah. - Clear. It's about this. I am the owner of a small one advertising company. I know many people in the city and I think, so I could get a lot money. For the hospital. Mhm. - I would be happy to help. You can do it arranged a brief meeting with him? You know, Mr. Figgis ... - Gospodina Bourdin? Car pump! Oh, I'm sorry. I have to go. Come in tomorrow morning in the hotel. People will follow him. Could ... Now I really have to go. I'm coming. Please ... Excuse me please - Oh ... Hello, Mrs Schweitzer. - Oh, it's Therese. Come in. - I'll be right there. Oh, Therese! Help me Please find my socks! What would we do? without it? Such are people from Günzbach Oh, wonderful! Have you breakfasted? You should be a cup de dared coffee? No, no, dr. Schweitzer. I'm fine, thank you. I want to say ... Outside there are young men, which I met yesterday, and it's your big one observer. Who is not, of course! I do not know if I mentioned you, to have some ideas, how to get a lot of money. Here, in New York. I was thinking, in these circumstances ... ... we must meet immediately. Not so, cashier? Invite him in. Here you are! My socks. Good morning. Just fast, because I know it's in front of you an important day. Madam. Schweitzer, Phil Figgis. Hello. I'm ashamed of it an event at the university. This man is one of the best the wicked Americans. Yeah yeah. No respect for life, right? That's right. It's very embarrassing for us. Mr. Figgis throughout the week is following our path. After an unfortunate incident, I was stopped in the corridor ... ... because ... He is ... What have you been? Good question. I'm some kind of ... let's say, mediator. Oh, God. - You're collecting money, is not it? I know a lot of people who are in favor of your work. All over town. Probably them you were not able to meet. I can get them for you. If you could get ready some materials, Mrs Bourdins However, perhaps from Europe or visit your hospital. I would bet out a leaflet, by which means here, in New York, Collected completely different way. I'm not a cheater and I will do everything for free. What do you think? Now that you're here this sock, but I go quickly, before you leave me. Goodbye! What do you think? Ah, I mean ... to miss the boat. With the ship arrive, yes, not by plane. We need to be right prepare a house. Grandpa for a long time He did not live here. Now living in Africa. You know. He was in Africa, before you were born? Yeah. A grandmother too she was with him.

Hals in Anne pi eta. Oh ... What is? The medicine ship has disappeared. Maybe they were stolen. No! Lene! Lene! Mom? - What's happening? A terrible government in Gabon she stopped supporting Especially ... Do it! It's a tough government in Gabon stopped supporting our activity and also construction villages for lepers. The hospital they will be closed from health and safety reasons. Or that at all can they do it? Of course they can not! No, except with the army. It's illegal! For health and safety reasons! They have no idea. A terrible government in Gabon It does not exist at all. It's been weaned. They invented it to bend uniforms in Libreville. What will he do? - What about? Hals and Anna are desperate. Since when is this? Since Thursday? - Yeah. I should be there. I'll have to edit things myself. Ah ... But, you just barely did. I will again want to. What? And Mom? I can not. New York has tired me. I hope you are not too long to wait. I waited on the cards. Now everything's fine. I'm very happy. I am very grateful to you. So, what do you think my idea? Do you think, that I wanted to give in? I know, I'm talking too much. - No. At first I thought, to conquer me. I was afraid of that. Excuse me, I said ugly. They both immediately noticed. Thus, first in Strassburg, then into the small village G nsbach. Then in Lambarene, hopefully. Uh! I'll order a beer. Would you? Beer, please. Where do I get this? She never insists, to stay here Although it is I'm deciding. That's why I broke up pathology, because it did not comply with high targets the great doctor. You're not right. He knows what's good is a medical life. Especially, if you are at home, and especially for females. Oh, those prejudices ... What about you? You're educated. Yeah, but I know that I could not stay long. And when you were a child, a small white bucket from Alsace, Not even three weeks survived in dungals. About family matters we often spoke. Why? again heated? I know. He was in New York so self-confident. The greatest man in the world! Applause, applause. Answer the world, dr. Schweitzer. Please, I want to only say that it is a solution for home. How many times is it in 10 years saw the kids? Once in Knigigsfeld and Mom. Mom! Nothing. I'm sorry. I should not. Ah, Rhena ... Who is? Good day. What do you want? Excuse me, that's it Schweitzer's house? Yeah. - He may be a doctor or Mrs Schweitzer at home? - Who should I announce?

What's your motive? - It's okay. I hope you do not mind, because Phil is with me. No. I am pleased. - We spoke on Wednesday, but it does not matter. We can get another day. No, no, it's okay. IM just ... Please, sit down. Is it coffee or coffee? Maybe something else? I'm sorry, that she can not. No problem. Is it out there? No, Mr Figgis. He wanted to go to Africa. GABON, GENTIL LAMBARENE Marcel. Marcel! Hey! Marcel, what is this? These are my things. How long are they here? It looks like they are send back. These are your crates. - That's right. My stuff. I do not know what's going on, But, wait. Rene! - Yes sir! Rene, come on! Teach people, to put it on my ship. And not the afternoon. - It'll be right away. Rene! These are boxes for the doctor. He will later say, as I said. Now, take care. Clearly, fuck! Yeah. - Quick! ... atomic weapons a game between the US and the Soviet Union can be all over the planet causes radioactivity radiation. Let's do it it's okay to stop. Atomic time is the groan for humanity. Every policy I should argue efforts to friendly coexistence and working together for human development. None is perfect, but I think, that Rhena did not have light childhood. He thinks he's going to resist him now? Like a little tyrant? I thought ... - Mr Figgis? Somebody's calling you on the phone. Maybe an uncle from America. You understand, do not you? Is it really for me? - Yeah, from America. I'll be right back. Thank you. Hello? Phil Figgis. Yes, there. Who is? Oh. Yeah. Honey, I did not say that Do not call me? Okay, that's what she was saying. What's happening. There is a full hour. Who, Einstein? Oh, no, really? In the Eleanor Roosevelt broadcast? For God's sake! Maybe tomorrow. By the way, who is the FBI, which I am seeing after New York? The one at Columbia University almost ruined it. That has nothing to do with you? It's clear he does not have. And what is the program? Gouta? G-oh ... G ... no? Ah, N-g-o-u ... Ngouta. Ngouta. Who is this? Officially or by the looks of it? Yes, I have to know! Jesus, I understand. Thank you very much. Yeah, you too. Ah ... Good news? Somebody big pharmaceutical corporations. He did not know how much It's a clock. But, it's one news very good. You can use it. Schweitzer is back due to some hygienic problems. Me? Oh no, what is this? There's one drink. Therese! Finally back! Ah, Anna! It's nice to have you back! Ah. Joseph! Doctor! Cordially welcome! - After months! It was a long trip. - I can think, Doctor. I ... How's Mink? He has a hard time. He could not come with us. The buildings are also standing. - I'll take immediate action. In half an hour we get in the hall. Before lunch. Me? Right. Ah, Mink, nice to you to see. How are you? I did not order you, to complete the settlement? Ah, Doctor, how can we do it? People clash, who are working. Who? Some soldiers have spoken and tore down the house. They made a whip and I cried. That's not right, Mink. I'm very angry. I have to sort this out. Where are there people? They are good. I'm ashamed of them in front of you. Call them. Come on! Come here, everyone. This time was hard for you. Similar to all of us. Let's do it now they will do better. I promise we will they made this settlement. Oh, I'm almost there forgot. I have some gifts brought you from the places where they are 10 times more than bamboo. You can eat. These are sweets. On, please. This is nice. Statue, higher than bamboo. Take it, eat it! It's tasty, it is. There is something going on here, something incomprehensible. They sent the Zaboje back. A terrible area, which does not exist at all. Soldiers pono i, hygiene problems and security. But, Doctor, the government has the right to say something about it. This is their area. - Do you think I did not ask? Libreville is guilty port of Port-Gentil. They say they are for health is responsible in Libreville. The minister says: No, doctor, we support you! Go to Foreign affairs. Even in the morning I telephoned. They will not know. And those excuses! Health and safety! Who would have thought. Well yes... - What is it, Erik? We're not exactly in line with clinical practice, right? How not? - Outside is a hospital like Angle African you. Goats around doctors, droppings every 10 steps, And monkeys in the forest? And dying everywhere? How much, Erik, how much? - That's it. Compared to Libreville We're good. I know that. Why do you think it's white? They come from Port Gentil to us to the doctor, If everything is here ... What about rats on a children's department? Those networks are not do not help! Let's start using DDT ... - It's a dangerous poison! Hazardous? - I can talk like a doctor ... Calm down. - No, Anna. David, no. No, no, thanks. I'm happy, to help me. I know what you want to say, and you are right. Dr. Hals has an opinion, and Susi has his own. Any decision, which you accept ... I know, old-fashioned I'm a doctor. Every decision it can also be abnormal. And here it is something else. Maybe it's a bomb. What do you mean? with a bomb? Perhaps your opposition is wrong atomic bomb. We're about to do this many times talked. You know well that I am defending you. But not all of them are. Dr. Hals for example, with all the respect, Erik ... Maybe it was word too fast. And what kind of relationship does this have? by closing the hospital? It may not be related with a hospital. They might spy behind you. Wait, you're too quick for me. What kind of connection does this have? with your work, which we all love? And I swear to you that I'm being taught and I greatly appreciate it, your cooperation. I do not understand that! I agree with the doctor. I do not know, what's his opinion about the bomb? links to the future of the hospital. Nevertheless, whether I agree or not, it did not happen to the public. There is nothing here in dungals It sounds like that. That charming government ... Who is this? What is his name? - He studied in England, just ... His name is ... Ngouta. Louis Ngouta. Mink e! No worries! I bought for your hammer Dreadnoughts. How are you today? - Never better, Doctor. Doctor, come on Look at something. Look at these kids and on the forehead. Ah ... Obviously these networks do not work, do not Anna. Take care of wounds and bring her to me later. Maybe it would be Mink Made some kind of bags. Mhm. Why are these matters? Would not you prefer to prevent it? We could use it rat poison. Ah ... - Of course, with poison It's too simple. Dead rats They attract mrÅ¡es. And killing is not always right decision. Yeah, yeah, again yours respect for life. Crazy ideas for a crazy old man. Yeah. When will this end? What are you suggesting? Where is the limit? 8-day creatures? Kill them. 4-night? Maybe. What about 2-nights and all others? If we kill all the rats, their predators will be laughing. And, great people Can I smoke less? It is permitted to kill all animals, which can be eaten. Everything. But, whether it's goose ever Warning, Do not eat rat poison? They are smart, but some do not know how to read it. For all you have the answer, but you're not always right. You're exaggerating sometimes. Gospodična, to bi mogla They also said for you. So do the doctor You can not make up your mind. - Wait a minute, let's ... I just want to take proper care for my patients with leprosy, You're saying ... - Your patients !? Excuse me, I think that's it our patients, for which we all are responsible. Dr. Schweitzer, You have a visit. Dr. Schweitzer. Excuse me, because we interrupt you. Louis Ngouta. Hello. This is my colleague, Sergeant Achebe. I understand that you are very much take on this wildlife, Doctor, but we need to know, when are you traveling occasionally? Worldwide. We have worrying reports about the state of the hospital. Of course it should be quickly edit the situation. Reports? Who reported it? I fight for poor lepers and their health. There were some of my patients Complaints from your conduct, sergeant! It's outrageous. I'm sorry. Something that gets out of hand. I'm aware of that. They may have been challenged. They challenged? Are you poor? Look at what kind living conditions. Yes, pardon worth it. Something needs to be done. We hope somebody will built our hospital, and they will be such a riot become a past. There will be a new hospital she also had a department for lepers, right? You know, Eric? - Mr Ngouta is the previous week mentioned the working plan and some funds for a modern hospital. Funds? What kind of assets? I can not detail speak, dr. Schweitzer. I know you understand business secrets. Of course, this is true on the whole project, industry, infrastructure ... - What kind of project? We'll be worried Business adventure with carts after this mud? Did you know about this, Doctor? I heard rumors about the hospital. We are not all enthusiastic over the idea of ​​a new hospital, ... Mr Ngouta, Excuse me, but I have to talk about this with colleagues. Can we continue tomorrow? You are very kind, Doctor. We can sleep slightly higher by the river. Simply, but practically. If you agree, I would meet again tomorrow, and look at it condition. That way they would get both better insight. Absolutely. Let us, to offer you lunch. A simple but practical lunch. I'm happy to accept it. Goodbye. And? What will we do now? Erik? I need to know, on which side you are. It's not about question of the page, right? For a long time I am working here, and you all know, on the side of me. Maybe it's right to the problem. It does not have to be ours opponents speak, that we need something, and that something has to be changed. I'm spraying you, where should we get the money? And more importantly, what kind of work will they do? If you knew, where do those money come from, and in a pocket pocket is the majority ... Believe that our patients and their families know, what will happen to them happened. They are like children! Do not worry for them, like us. Ofcourse not! However we can not wait ... Like children? Or with these words Do not you ponder? Maybe you people speak, let them live in their way. I'm sorry, Doctor. I do not understand this. No, David, no. The question is, Are they ready for this step? I'd give them something syringes and needles and said, should they treat themselves? You're right. Maybe I live in For centuries. You say, what should I do. You can not do as much as you can Doctor, Doctor. Do not be scared. We are on your side. Clear! No, doctor. Anna? Mom, please. Are you really right? Is this really just the case? Angle of Africa? We really are did you manage to create it? Why do you put it like that stupid questions, Doctor? You know, It's not like that. Maybe I'm going to draw, as Susie says. With all the anger over Ngouto and rumors of a bomb ... I have to be sure, what's right. I need friends, Anna. I really became old tyrant? When I first I said, You said: You've signed up to Olympus. And I'm here, Zevs. It took a long time for me to be here understand your waist. Why did you think, to say sorry? Ah, Anna ... Tired of the stations. I'm old. I have to learn, How to sleep ... Ah ... Thanks for being kind, Anna. Thank you. - No, doctor. Ship she arrived. Come on! The ship is here! Welcome to Lambarena. - Thank you. Welcome. You are ... - Therese Bourdin. This is a colleague Phil Figgis. I do not know, you will dr. Schweitzer said, ... Of course, I am informed, Mrs Bourdin. He's his trainer. Mr. Figgis, hello. - Good day. Can I help? - Ah ... I'm David Fuller, one of the mazes. Sorry about that time. It is often so, dr. Fuller? Let's say it's not that bad, as in Manchester. It's Quabi. - Hello. It's Wambua. Hello. - And this is Wambu's friend, I forgot my name. Three hearts. Guys, will you help? - I'm aphelly. This helps with childhood. We follow this path. These are ours temporary residence. For some, for others it is less time-consuming. Most patients He is here with his family. They stay here, until the patient recovers. You want to cook yourself, we just We provide food and everything else. Well, even for work. Build, grow, which is still needed. Here we go. Just like that they can pay. Druzine tako they stay together. When I mention food, They're almost laughing. The hard way is, is not it? It is. We'll go with you. Mr Ngout, no matter what to your opinion, I will be direct. It will be yours for the good government as she said her power, I can not to imagine what will happen, Who, you ... will be your country became independent. Ah! Therese and g. Figgis! Get in! Most the staff has already met. I'm sorry, because We did not wait for you. No problem, we missed you. It's nice be with you. These two guests They are not known. Sergeant Achebe and Mr Louis Ngouta. They present it in a timely manner the government of Gabon, as they say. - Hello. It's Therese talented photographer, who will be taken care of made for a movie star. Her colleague, Mr. Figgis He devoted himself to everything New York, collect money for us. So, where are we staying? Are you ready? For what? For independence. That's what we think. This is a question of trust. You are some African invited to lunch, dr. Schweitzer? Ah, Joseph! Moment. Joseph! I can introduce you Josepha, which is from everything starting with us. There's his friend N'Zeng. He was one the first patients. It's a reward I got a case with us. Could be an invitation some of your friends at that lunch? Doctor, you know, that they would not want to come. They will personally inviting? Personally? - Um ... As you can see, homeowners Do not eat food, which they do not prepare themselves. They are afraid to make them neighbors poisoned. It's good, Sergeant Achebe? In Libreville I worked as a cook, Here it is every cook. I cooked this food, Mr. Ngouta, Sergeant Achebe. My wife she cooked me. What about doctors? Are there some Africans? - Are you a volunteer? I studied at Oxford politics and economy, and not medicine. As you see, we are dr. Fuller, dr. Hals, Senior sister Anna and me all volunteers. There is no other possibility. No money. None of us has Rolls Royce. But I can say, that I did not know any an African volunteer doctor. I'm very disappointed - Did you get a good idea? The Africans did not borrow so much, as we are with them. For some debts go? We took their land, their oil and copper, their diamonds and people. And what are we? in exchange? Suicide, alcohol and diseases. It sounds like an old story, but it's about the truth. Old colonial debts can not be paid, doctor. We live in the middle 20th Century.

This is the work of the people tells us, how some people are brilliant, they may not know them. Then you'd like to see them. For example, where you live, and in the middle African d ungle you do it noble work. So do you make a commercial for a doctor? - No no. I want people tell the truth. However, interesting work. He's a big man. Hm! Hi, Wambua! Quabi! How's it going, Kumpel? Petko! You do not know what this is? So we say goodbye with friends in New York. May I show you? Raise your hand.

They have to go every day to work in a hospital? They will not force me. I love to work and learn. I understand. What she may have heard for that soldier and his chef? Excuse me, sir. I have to take it fast. Clear. I see it. Hello. Where have you been? Some wonderful shots I'm from the hospital. Since difficult cases, they will not be able to publish them. Maybe only some. We'll have to watch, what we will use. Of course. Oh, horror! Is this a hospital? Ah, Phil, Where are you living? Have you ever been to north of New York? In Central Park They have a bunch of manure. Yes, they certainly do lepers and grow cabbage? My God, in my opinion, that you are from the Middle Ages. It's lepeness contagious. Most of these patients, however there are other diseases. Leprosy attacks immune system. At least I think so. Anyway, the painter I'll be for the flyer. You could prepare text, Figgis! Of course, ma'am, One hundred times. Hm ... Therese? Oh my god. - Where are you? Phil, look at this. What is it? It seems to me, It's an X-ray. Certainly something is dear, and therefore they do not end. It must be for that be some reason. The doctor will be done knew. Photo? Hm. I do not know, If this is a good advertisement. You saw Ngouto today and his soldier? How? Why you Is it interested? I know. Because of the uniform. - You guessed my secret. No, I just want to know, what they are planning. Maybe it's important. Susi? I said yes opravi it. For what? For all requests. I do not know. I'm sorry for A riot in the hospital. I was uncomfortable. Especially because of these guests. Ngouta and soldier? Yeah, and the Americans. Mr. Figgis? A little crazy? He talks too much. However, I will not be your enemy. Is it yours? I think I'm always to you a little hard. Perhaps too. I have a lot of worries. Doctor ... I think people would be They like to love, Though everyone is It's hard to have a job. You see. I'm stupid. Excuse me. Who did Jesus love? Do we even know? Anybody at all? Maybe your own Mom. Father Joeefa, a carpenter who scampered his wood and hardly understood what? She's right, angry Susi. Who were those people. This should be asked. Jesus is not yours He did not help. I have to do what it is my Father, he said. Poor Jo ef. What's the answer, Anna? Too many questions You're asking, Doctor. You got up early and passed a visa. Try it. What can we do? Yes, you are right. As always, Anna, as always. I'm keeping you. I want you maybe no. May the angels protect you, and so on, somehow. It's their song. Hm. For Washington Post. Dear Sirs, From my heart I write to you, because I'm deeply aware powerful consequences, not for me, but for others, for which I am worried, not ... over ... controlled using atomic ... It does not make much sense. Let's be honored. I understand what you think, but I do not know why. Where are you from? Centuries of life in the community, deep self-confidence, prosperity and power. Mali Gabon is in 9th month of pregnancy. We'll be free soon. We're upset. You are denouncing us, because we're breast milk? Very nice metaphor, Mr. Ngouta. I do not know who you are promised milk, but ... the consequences are can be unpredictable. To people you have to think. It's with this attacking Schweitzer, do not count on name. It can be happy, to have you, Erik. Thanks for Whiskey No, no. Mr Ngouta! Mr Ngouta! Mr Ngouta, oh, finally! I'm going to test for a long time Talk to you. This space is not ideal. - For what, Mr. Figgis? Mr Ngouta, I'll explain it immediately. Pretty much I know, who would love to I closed this hospital. And maybe this one can provide money for your new one hospital. Provided, of course, that ... new Gabon ... then him ... help ... I am right? I just wonder, whether this aid will be received, You will close the hospital. You have your work, I am my own. I wanted to They will ask, what will happen to people, You will close it. Schweitzer remains, We cut our necks the rest. Sister Anna, quick! Quickly after the doctor! Anna! Sister! Quick! Doctor's Madame is here! Lene? Lene! My God, what happened? Is it boi? I have you a very nice gift. Oh, that's mine new birthday! Rhena! What about the little two? That would be You're going too far! Hi, both of you! Helen, look, Who's here. Ah, Joseph! Thank God! The most hard-working man! Oh, Doctor! What are you doing? Liver and my legs they do not do well, but the heart It's possible. Rhena, she remembers a great friend of Joseph? She'll be 10 years old, but she is I'll remember it well. Ah, Therese! You will work! Where do we meet? He has surrounded you, when did you hear? Mr Figgis, Hello! - Are you me? - Nice to see you again. No, they are all like that kind. Oh, Doctor! Doctor! What a pity! You can be tomorrow look at the new settlement? - My pleasure. And Susi. Hello and welcome. He thinks it is very serious? You remember people in New York. Just how they can be read my letters? These are government secrets of the police. They do what they want. What are you all about? wrote to Albert? What I thought. That atomic bomb catastrophe for the world. Loka and the puke man he never forgot ... No, Lene, that's it Quite different. Let me explain it to you. It will not be late. Politicians do not speak the truth. Only scientists know it. But Albert, that is ... Do not you see, what did you do? We want to break you. They call you for racists and laughter. Are you aware? Money will begin, and the hospital will be lost. It's still better than losing the world. - Oh, your apocalypse. Oh, my dear! We speak about the Apocalypse. I'm from there. And what this means a safe area? All journals they're talking about her. What is this little one? Hospital compared with the whole country? - Did she tell you? I know. It's serious. I do not know why we would not resist. He has a real eye, Also, if everyone would patients died tomorrow, CIA would not be with with a finger of a mignil. It's the same David said. David? - Dr. Fuller, good man. I'm in trouble always support. So, being aware, That's because of the bomb? I feel it guilty, because Alberta and Oppenheimer I can not publicly support. What should I do? In this case not relevant, is the support hidden or public. Against us they do not choose the supplies. Your private letters! What kind of people are that? They can not win! I know well, how hard it is. I am very happy, that they are with me. Hey, guys! Can I paint you? We can Poka e ogo? Say, please. It's good. Please, boys, to get away from this. Do you understand? It's ugly. You will get sick. Clear? Sister, sister! Can you call a doctor? - Yes, right away! Obvious spy behind us. Who knows how long. And how long can it be We'll crack it. What's with that fence? Very strong was. Guys would not do this. - Mink e, Can I do it before? repair? Yes, Doctor. Joseph, warns of your safety to the danger of this sign. The most terrible rv! - Mhm. That's not the dead can be removed. I am interested in, for what is that device. Just two weeks we used it. We have a lot here the equipment they have removed from the beautiful a clinic in Zhrich. Here, rats and moisture. There is a poor electricity and no maintenance. I feel awkward, but or do you also find it, to give the doctor his damages take care of yours future? I know it must nice to look. The old man discovered it equilibrium between what we can do and what we want. Somewhere We are communes. I see, David, that you are pretty emotional. Is not in the commune First you need to take care for good care and clean water? Clear. A code get money? He does not Ngouta offered? Then you take care of him. I trusted you. He'll really sell to pharmacists Roche or Beecham because of the case in Libreville? And then I copied it only their medicines in exchange for money? - I prefer to have such business, like you with a doctor, who once again hunts fish, that they do not need patients steal or buy. Come on, Eric. It's lucky end. We'll be through one Summer will be here? Only weapons for war! You were right! But that He did not expect anything. What happened? I was drowning. One bastard was cut security fence! What kind of a fence? That around the X-ray. Guys are in there and played with a new one! But that's the case was radioactive! Albert, just who would you do that? I think I know. It's not about that. Who knows what we do they'll do it. It was this dangerous thing that they used, against which we fight! Spread! These guys will be They died for me. It's funny. What are you blaming? How to do it at all can you connect? If they are all capable, even reading private letters, then I'll tell voice. I have enough! ... I agree with my friend Albert Einstein and I call my colleagues scientists, to tell the world what kind of danger is an atomic bomb. I say this opinion worried heart, with the care you are bothering me day and night. I'm not here yet able to send. Now I will! BOLNI NICA LAMBARENE When do you think, that they will open this? That's it once ends. If I only knew before, how dangerous this is ... Albert ... I know not it sounds like, but, I would be glad, to return home. Take it at least What a free day, maybe not every week, as you are God, but at least once a month. What does that letter mean? Did you sink your ship? Have you asked your mom something? Did you think to ask me? I'm nothing for you! It's always the same! Ah, Rhena, calm down! This does not help. It's okay did not decide. What should I do? They say that they can not win. And who are they? I will not do anything, I betray my old friends. Oh, old friends? It's nice, what is betrayal your old women? And publishing young girls? And hospitals, and patients, and everything we've been trying for? She says herself ... - I know! You. I do not know what I'm saying, I do not know what to think. These are your dreams! This hospital. People here. This is the meaning of your life! And not just yours! What is this comparison? with yellow print? ... which we turn to tomorrow. - Mom is right. Hospital against old news! Get off! Rhena, I want to He knew how. Money is coming. I'll tell you rightfully, First time in life I feel tired. They may be able to close hospital, but they can not close my mouth. This is a solution for you. What about us? I can remind you, that your wife is in years and years old She lived without you, that you can work for these words. As a child I lived without father, that you could work for these words. We were proud of you. It was not easy, but all the devil took it upon themselves. Now, it will all rejected because of some illnesses Spies in Washington. I can not believe. He thinks he is I do not know that? He thinks I did not noo for the night, year after year in front of you mother and their children, who cried and cried, and I mean it on you? If this is my job whether selfish, it would be even more selfish try to get away. Congratulations for a very philosophical one an apprentice. I could also philosophize. - Never mind, stop it. I can not download this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. I let you go I'll be alone. Dear friends, I have a bad news. I think my presence It hurts the hospital. Obviously, I have serious opponents. Well, I got it also friends. Some of you sit here. They are also among people, which we help. But there are only a few of these, with whom we can speak. But some of us are in America They do not like it. These are the enemies of my friends. And that's why your enemies. These are impatient people. From the weird fears they make real fears. With a doctor and my daughter Rheno We have been long talked, how to solve the problem. It's a solution simple. That's what I think. I'll leave, there is a possibility, that they will be my adversaries leave the hospital alone. In fact, I am now rv, which should be cut from the body. I hope ... I hope from the bottom of my heart, that you will stay and fought for conservation Lambarene. You are my best colleagues and friends. In particular, who remind me, that in the 20th century, and to us it does not have to be permanent look at Susi. Now, Dear friends, goodbye. A great doctor Going home! We'll be sick closed. Therese! Therese, come quickly! The kids are in the rooms! Calm down! You can not get out! There are fresh wounds. Do it! A man laughing! This hospital we will close. Doctor tomorrow he goes home. Do not be afraid! Strauchi vas! Do not leave! There must be a Gabon hospital here! We have foreign hospitals! She can not take her away! Segun, please. He is a laughing stock! We are here. The patient will stand. Doctors and nurses If we care about you. Big Doctor goes! Only he heals! No big doctor No hospital. All home! Get out! There are no doctors, no sisters No medicine! Get away from home! Already after a long time after luggage I'm back socks. Father, that you have to see. Mom? Come on! The doctor did not leave. The big doctor is here. Who do we love? Doctors male? No, no, no, but a great doctor! And who likes us? Small doctors? No, no, no, but a great doctor. You would be he had to listen. Attention, beware! A great doctor it's home now. Lene! We'll be sick zap ... Dr. Schweitzer! Allow the word. Today is your day. He'd be a bad bastard You would not be too complicated. It would be stupid for the new Gabon to overlook these people. And not to mention patients. Given these reasons, and there will be no other, but I hope that, I will be grateful, You will be for these people Continue taking care. Building our new hospital it's pretty far away. I'm here surprised? That's how it works. Must be a possibility grab it. Today, dr. Schweitzer. What are they going to do today? instructions, doctor? Instructions? Work fluently as always, dear Anna. Mink e! Quabi! Fanta, come on! Mr. Ngout? Mr Ngouta! Only word, before you go. What's happening? What happened? I have all the notes in this note. Enough proof for closure and kandal. Discarded medicines, exploitation of children, you will give up because of Dance of these savages? - I thought ... - Mr Figgis. Talk about my compatriots. Excuse me for rude behavior. I forgot how you feel. Among us, because we are together with the United Nations on the same page. Do not you? And what's this site? Oh. I understand now. So it does not matter, The hospital will be closed. You have guaranteed money. It's a turning point. It seems to me, that you are bothered. Our assurances are investments and development aid. As for your organization, this is not my business. I think Schweitzer's political activities can be used in a more convenient way. - So you do not need us anymore? On the contrary, Mr. Figgis. We do not need you personally. Goodbye. Phil! Just for memory. You're sorry because friends are leaving? Are you lonely? - Therese, just ... Ngouta was ... - Do not bother. I know that I'm slow to remember, but now I understand. I do not care, You shave fools from me. But from these people! I've been living my whole life ... I have heard his orders ... What are you doing here? Yes, the boy threaten with radioactivity? Painfully, Therese. I'll sit down with you tearful freedom. Mar nih, except you, Does not have any plans? What would it be, the Russians make a bomb, and we do not? Mr Figgis, You really think, that you will be keeping it laughing among people did you say the world? - Who is the world? I do not have big plans. I only care for individuals. Just your work I'm doing it. You are almost proud of yourself. Goodbye. Hello, guys! Stop, Quaby, stop it! Give me that. Mink e. It's best to get the first one board for a new settlement. What did he say? What's the laugh? Just repeats for you, doctor, when you said they would for such homes all hotels get sick for gobavostjo Ah, Philip! An unforgettable joy! He can not knock? Stop that, bastard. I'm 100 miles away plunged over the dirty river and a week's ate food and watching drowsiness. All in vain. - Philip. You forgot, What is our job? We are not scouts! Not really, but We are like them. I have my legs on my feet and diarrhea. And now let me phone again from Micks Bar? Philip, you were insured. We knew that you we'll need it. Thank you. Was this insurance? also related to the FBI? I said, that I have nothing with them. Hoover spy on Einstein and perhaps for Schweitzer. As far as I know, yeah before the arrival of McCanthy. What about that Ngout? and his gangsters? He hit me seriously. You said it was a man. I was bumping there in the wall. Just glassy He was watching me. I think they are agreed with the French for more attractive deals, as we imagine. Money? Diamante? Oil? Order? Cocaine? Are you sure? I bet it will be Mr. Ngouta in an important position in the new government. Whatever my position will be, Charlie? What will happen to yours loyal servant? It's great to be well insured. I do not know why you are so furious. We would need you, but it was not necessary. Schweitzer is himself he opposed himself. Who is the Communist? proposed a dismantlement? Letters are here. It's over with him. You think so? I'm not so sure, wise men! And if I tell you right, I'd rather see, that he wins, and you lose. Doctor! Telegram! Doctor! Telegram! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor, Telegram! NOBEL'S AWARD Z MIR In my room in Lambarena I have it on the shelf a small book with the thoughts of LaoTse, a great Chinese thinker from the 6th century BC. You have to remember his thoughts about war and victory. The weapon is a terrible evil and can not be a tool the honest man. Only if there is no other choice, we can use it. Whoever looks forward to victory, He was happy for killing. Terrible massacres many people should be washed with compassionate tears. Every man is moody, and develop within it Pray for humanity. Both of them are in us, We just have to scream. Waiting for a spark everyone can develop his own Lambaren. Schweitzer is with money Nobel Prize Completed settlement for lepers.
