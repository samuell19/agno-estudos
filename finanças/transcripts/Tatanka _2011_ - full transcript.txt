Stop! Stop! Arms high! Keep going! Sabatino... I'm looking for two thieves. Here? Just a bunch of young guys here. Those two are young guys. A police officer was killed on the seafront yesterday. And they did it? No, but maybe they know something. I thought you said "thieves". Anyway, nobody came in here. If you want to check... That's the weight-training room, they could be... Come on, I'll show you. Right in here. - Thanks all the same. - Have a nice day. Now beat it. Get out, go on. Take your stuff and go. They drop like flies here. Pasquale, you too? Beat it, go on. Come on, out. If you come here again, I'll turn you in myself. Why not train here instead of pissing about with him? You've got a good punch. - Move it. - Don't touch me! Here we are. Sit down. Vito's here too. Sit properly. Hey, Rosario. Hey, Vito. Michele. What's going on, Vito? What is this? It's about that cop killing. Why the long face? Did you do it? One of the killers had red hair. What time did you get home? Don't remember. Is that so? - Who were you with? - My family. Before. - No one. - You weren't with friends? - You're sure? - I was on my own. Listen up... - What time did you get home? - 9:30. - Tell the truth! - 9:30. Were you alone? I was with Monica Bellucci. Just answer, don't be a smartass! - The redhead's a tough guy! - Sure! They're all scared of you, huh? Look at this punk, I'm frightened! Real scary. Now we'll see! - Who was at Checkmate? - Just me. Just you? So why did you say: "Someone can tell you I was there"? I didn't do anything. Rosario, do you know Vito? - Who? - Vito. I know him. Were you with Vito last night? Who were you with? Michele? He butt-fucks you or you butt-fuck him? We take turns. - What a wise guy. - Being a wise guy, huh? No, you're the ones being wise guys. - Who's being a wise guy? - Wait, Esposito! Easy... - Like being underwater, Carrot Top? - Sure. Looking for mussels. What do you say, Carrot Top? Carrot Top, you're pissing me off. - Is he pissing you off too? - Yeah, me too. - Let's see if he likes the sea. - Well? Sweet Carrot Top... Hold this asshole still! Time to go under. Open wide, bastard! This is what you get for not talking, scum! - Open wide! - Let's see if you remember! You shithead! Acting tough. Stupid assholes... Call an ambulance! No answer? What are looking at? Get the fuck out! Move it! Try again. Hey, Michele. You saw the pasta I left you? Oh, you're already eating? How are you, kid? Everything okay? You look a bit angry. What's up? Something happened? They killed a cop, grandpa. - Really? - They took me to Police HQ. Oh, great! Well? What'll happen now? Are they blaming you? No, they questioned everyone. They're after a kid from here. What? A kid from this neighborhood? You know I don't want any trouble, right? You need to do something. Get a job, be a garbage-collector, anything! Luisella! Why the fuck is that guy yelling? Luisella! - What should I do, jump in? - How do I know? Go, go! Go talk to her, dickhead! - Will you go talk to her? - What do you want? Keep your fucking nose out! I get it, you're a real idiot. I get it. Move. Faggot! Luisella, right? - What does this guy want? - Ignore him. - You're Luisella, right? - How do you know? I was watching you. Really? I didn't notice. Okay... - Give me that phone! - I'm not gonna steal it! Give me that phone! I don't know you! Well done, faggot! - You're a faggot! - Who are you calling faggot? - What are you doing? - Exchanging numbers. - They're fighting! - Run! They're fighting! I'll get you! Shitface! How'd it go with that girl? Let's go get the backpack. Get back. Get back, please. Stand back! Poor kid. - Redhead, it's on you tonight. - Why do I always have to pay? They're closing already? Michele, I won! Get a drink. See who came in? Salvatore, Ciccio Vitiello's son. Did you see his car? - The family? - All fine, thanks. Hello? Hey, Luisella! Everything okay? Give it to me... Hello? - You're a real prick. - Hey, Luisella. - Is it really you? - Is it really you? Cash this token, babe. Tell us what's going on? What can I tell you? They poured sea water in his mouth to make him talk. - Put out that cigarette. - He's telling us something. They poured in so much water it bust his windpipe. When they saw what they'd done, they chucked him in the sea. All this mess for a lousy bastard who took bribes. Well, what'll I bring you? Everything okay, Salvatore? If you need anything, I'm always here. - Who is that? - One of the local jerks. That's all we need. Now what? - Where were you? - At the employment office. Go home, I'm closing. At 10:00? What's going on? There's a curfew, orders from the Chief of Police. To stop them killing anyone else? Don't worry, go get some sleep! Beat it! Always loafing around here! Told you I'd get you. What do you want? Want to talk or not? Son of a bitch! Piece of shit! - Who's the faggot? - Gimme a blow job. Act like a man, okay? Bring me your mom! Quick, guys! Lucia, help! Call someone! Did you fuck her? Never mind, come on. I'm in here 'cause of you, fuck her at least. Is she hot? Are they treating you okay? I had to end up in here sooner or later. How about you? The cars? Rosario, no more cars. You're right. What'll you do now? - Don't you go to school? - No. I need money. You're telling me! Let's see how you make out. What do you weigh? 70 kg? Pasquale, in the ring! You know him, right? Pace, pace! Come on, guys! Well done, rest... Get out, come on! Finish the lap, I'll go get things ready. Come on! Inside, quick! - Be gentle, Michele. - Sure! «The Romanian, » «is a great boxer.» «They fought 18 months ago» «in Turkey...» «and he lost on points. » «That match was very uncertain,» «as are predictions» «for the outcome of this final...» «for the gold medal» «in the featherweight division.» «Parisi takes a left» «from Dumitrescu.» Tomorrow I'm taking you for an away match. I need permission from your dad, mom... who's at home? My grandpa. Where are we going? To America. Michele, use your head. Watch how he moves! When his guard's down, left, right hook! Floor him, we're losing on points. Left, hook, right! Bust that bastard's ass, Michele! - What did he say? - Bison. Straight to bed, okay? And the cash? Cash? - What cash? - The cash Frank gave you. Listen... I want to take you to the Olympics and you think of cash! - Olympics? - You're not like the others. You're one in a million, there's dynamite in your hands. How do you get to the Olympics? - By listening to me. - What've I gotta do? - Complete the championship series. - Then what? - Get on the national team. - How? You need an important club behind you! Know what we'll do? Apply to Golden Flame. Know who they are? The police team. - No, I'm not gonna be a cop. - Forget the Olympics then. To be a boxer, you have to join the army or the police. But don't worry, I'll take care of things. I'll introduce you to an inspector friend of mine. Don't worry. - See you at the gym tomorrow. - Bye, coach. Will you stop making a din with that Vespa? Luisella... Wait, be quiet! - Luisella, I won! - Move back! - What happened to your face? - It's nothing. - Let me see. - It's nothing. Luisella, I fought. It was really fantastic. My friends cheered me on and I beat the bastard! Be quiet! Why? - You'll wake my dad up. - So what? Why is he always pissed off? He doesn't want us to see each other. Why not? What've I done? I don't care about your dad, I'm going to the Olympics! - World champion! - Pipe down! Will you take me too? Of course, honey. Take this off. Aren't you hungry? Are you in love? I'm off, grandpa! Where are you going? Come here. Can't you wear a shirt properly? Its unbuttoned... Your tie looks like an artichoke... You're meeting the Police Inspector. He'll spot that you're a punk right away. That's better. Go on. I missed this shitty bar. Dang! You're out at last. - Everything's cool now, huh? - Thank God. You remember that diving dickhead? - The guy who got you locked up? - Yeah. Why? His dad owns a grocery warehouse. Exports abroad too. He's loaded. We gotta make him pay. No time to waste. Are you going somewhere? You're wearing a tie, shirt... Where are you going? I have to do something really important. Really important? Let's hear it. - Something really important. - I get it! Can't we do it tomorrow? Not tomorrow, now. Yes or no? Look me in the eyes. Have you got any balls? Okay, I'll do it myself. Fuck you. Sabatino, sorry, but... No answer. - Something must've happened. - Give me a break. Sorry. Bye. Finish loading the van, I'll be right back. Hands up! Hands up, move! Quick, move it! Take that stocking off! Well? Let's go! Rosario, he saw my face. Hey! Where are you going? Michele, the party's over. Come on, let's go. Who'd you steal this car from? - What's this? - A present. Here we have aqua-gym, synchronized swimming, the lot. Look how much fun they have in this pool. That's the sauna, and that's the Turkish bath. Let me show you something. Give me the suit. Nice, huh? Get my robe. Give him the special treatment. He's the new manager. Well, did you like it? I'll show you around after, you can settle in. What did you mean by "new manager"? You think I'd leave you in the shit? You'll run this joint from now on. I talked to Salvatore, he's fine about it. Why the long face? Look, you don't get it: we don't use guns anymore. No, I get it, Rosario. This joint's clean, trust me. You didn't tell me you were getting out. How are you? Come here. You nearly killed me. What'll I do with you? Don't you realize I'm old? - How are you? - Awful, don't ask. Come on, come inside. Who was expecting all that trouble? How come the birds are in the house? They banned me from keeping them outside. They say their singing keeps people awake during siesta time. - How about some coffee? - Thanks, grandpa. Sit down if you want. I'll go make coffee. - Yes? - I'm looking for Luisella. - Luisella who? - A girl who lives here. Never heard of her. Sorry, thanks anyway. Coach! - Who is it? - Left and right hook! Michele! Come in. What a surprise! Sorry... - I was sleeping... - It's okay. Well, let's have a look at you. God! Tatanka! Excuse the mess, but lately... You paid dearly for that fuck-up, huh? Let's forget it. Cheers. Now what? Plans? I want to go to the Olympics. You're serious? I trained for 8 years, I'll start where we left off. Is your pal still with Golden Flame? Sure, Golden Flame... they won't even look at you now! Golden Flame's the only team? There's no alternative? Maybe a private club. - You have the gym, right? - Yeah, the gym. How can I put it? It's a matter of cash. Know someone with money? It's like a morgue in here. Hey! Behave! Congratulations, Salvatore! Everything okay, handsome? Did you congratulate my wife? Anna, look who's here. - Congratulations, ma'am. - Thanks. - Watch the hands. - Thanks for coming. This is Michele, the guy I told you about. - The boxer. - Congratulations. He's a big guy! You were in Saint Mary's? - How was your time in there? - Swell. We built that prison! No wonder you like it there. Well? Salvatore, about that thing we discussed... - We'll talk later. Eat now. - Where shall I put this? On there. Make yourself at home. Make yourself at home. What are you doing here? Come on. - Come on. - Easy, I just ate. - Where are we going? - Don't worry, come on. What are they doing? We need someone stronger! Look who's here! Saint Mary's! Come here, Saint Mary's. Everything okay? Guys, we've got a real boxer here! - Show us what you're made of. - How? Floor the buffalo with one punch. Place your bets guys, come on! Take that jacket off. You're a big, strong guy. Come on! You can do it! You can do anything! This guy's got balls! - Sure he can do it? - He can do it. Think you can do it? Great! See, you did it! See what a good investment you are? - Go ahead. - Thanks. - How long will it take? - It's in a real state. - The gym's been closed for ages. - Vandals break in... If things aren't looked after, this is what happens. It won't be easy, the place is a wreck. It's been left too long. If you'd come to me sooner, it'd have been easier. It'll take a month, six weeks. Can't do it any quicker. There's plenty to do, the equipment needs changing. The fixtures are rusty, they need changing too. - It's a gym, not a drawing room. - It's my job, I know how to do it. For pity's sake... I can be wrong by a few days, but that's what it'll take. - You can't do it any sooner? - It'll cost more. - What's the problem? - None, it can be done. We'll work overtime, but the quote will be higher. A month then. It's beyond dusty! Okay, over there. Next. Hang on, let's have some order. What's your name? I'm finished Sabatino. I'm going for a run. Get some rest. You'll get sick. Your fight's the day after tomorrow. Do what you want! - Is it straight? - Yeah. Let's see. Well? Keep calm. You need to be calm and focused. This is a show. When you start again, it's like this. Go change, it's late. Get ready for a thrilling afternoon! Ladies and gentlemen, two great sportsmen face each other in a display of strength and boxing technique. On my right, Marcianise's "Tatanka", defending the colors of Excelsior Boxing Team: Michele Mucerino! On my left, the Cyclops of Vesuvius, 103 kg of brute strength, three-time district champion: Ciro Cassius Cartone! Keep calm, don't worry. Keep your guard up and nothing will happen to you. Let him do the work. He'll tire himself out... Go, Tatanka, we're gonna beat 'em all! Stop a second... Stop, I have to talk to you. What about? That farce at the mall? Why are you pissed off? Look, we need that kind of thing. Read this. We have to focus on entertainment. The next match will be official. I talked to Criscuolo from the Federation. We're in the qualifying rounds for the regional championships. - He agreed? - He sure did, bro. Shit, you're all sweaty! Get off me! Put 'em up! I heard that Antimo Fierro's gonna fight too. He's a great boxer, but he's got a problem... He's in recovery. - Bro! How are you, Rosario? - Fine, and you? - Everything's okay. - This is Michele. Hello, Michele Mucerino. What can I get you? I'll take care of it. Nice here, huh? Like the pool? That's the restaurant. Now we'll check out the match location. Drink up. Michele. Go ahead, I'll be right there. That's the place. We've held fantastic concerts here. Big stars: Aurelio Chianese, Tony Tarantino... Huge crowds. And the seating? - In the sand. - Over there too? All over! It'll be professional! A regular match! Madison Square Garden on the beach. I like it. But listen... will Salvatore come? Good. You've changed. You haven't at all. Come on, don't look at me like that. Tell me about you, where do you live? Michele, please... I'm happy to see you. I'm glad you're okay. But excuse me, I have to go. - Come here. - Please, I have to go. Come here. Come on, Michele! I have to go. Michele, I have to go! Don't come looking for me, Michele. Don't come looking for me. Why all the hurry to see me alone? - Want to come clean? - How'd it go with Peppino? Fine. The place is fantastic, close to the sea too. Listen, Rosario... What've you got in mind? Michele's not ready, he's not a real boxer. - But his fists can break rocks! - He lacks technique. He'll only end up getting hurt. Don't worry, Sabatino. Just do your job. He needs 30 points to turn pro, right? 30? At least! You don't make a boxer like that: ten matches and away you go. If he stays amateur, we can train him well: he can get onto the national team, maybe even go to the Olympics. Professional. The sooner we see some cash, the better! You were up shit creek, knee-deep in debt... I think we've helped you plenty. Hey, Ciro. - Everything okay? - Fine, fine. Sabatino, we're ready. Peppino! - Make it a great night. - No worries. - One great night. - Don't worry. - Is the champ ready? - Always. Here he is! - You're gonna take us? - Let's go. Michele, come on. Antonio, move your butt. To Excelsior! «Here's Michele Mucerino, » «the Marcianise boxer who hasn't» «lost a match in 15 months.» Have a nice evening. - Who's she? - Dunno, some German chick. We're set for this month too. Did Michele say anything? No, nothing. He just asked me... What's with the silence? - Nothing. - Looks like we won, huh? We were discussing your future. After the fight with Fierro, you'll have enough points to turn pro. Shit, I'm getting a belly... You don't look pleased. I think it's a bit too soon. We should take it slower, think about the Olympics... Don't kid around, Michele. I'll turn you into a pro and it'll be a different ball game. You'll go fight in America. We'll go the whole hog. Okay, that's enough. Let's go. Let's go see a friend of mine nearby. Sabatino? Let's go, Sabatino, come on. No, I'm bushed. You two go. Have fun. Lemme take a photo, Michele. Thanks. - You're German, right? - From Berlin. My hotel's nearby. My last night in Naples, I go home tomorrow. It must be amazing to see your opponent go down... with one punch. Shame it was over so quickly. Yeah, duration's important. Is that clear? What are you doing? I can't leave you alone for a second! Let's go. Fucking shithead! What happened? Let's go or I'll burn this lousy dump down. You go, I want to stay. Okay, I get it. Why don't you stay? I can't. Why not stay in Naples? Impossible. I run two restaurants. Come with me. And do what, make pizzas? Okay, message received. - What's going on? - Courtesy call. You're late today too? Where were you last night? Do things properly or fuck off! Are you drunk, Sabatino? Calm down. Yours truly has won all his matches with a K.O. Michele... How can you expect to do things on the level with Rosario? Michele... you're just an investment for Rosario. The gym's like a supermarket, they don't give a shit about boxing. And we even have to be grateful they gave us this chance. We're rejects, damaged goods. Understand? Can't you keep this shit to yourself? - No. - Why? Because you've got to lose this time. Rosario said they all bet against you. You have to lose against Antimo Fierro. How do you feel, champ? Antimo Fierro's like a raging bull. Listen, Michele... I don't give a shit about what you know or think you know. You said we'd do things on the level. On the level? When did you become a boy scout? We used to go stealing together. I give you a hand and this is how you thank me? I did eight years in the slammer for you! I kept my mouth shut. So, it's all coming out at last. I didn't want to kill that guy. If you didn't want to play the martyr, you should've talked. Who asked you to? Who? Sit down. We can't allow for any fuck ups this time. There's a shitload of cash at stake. Understand? Now go into the ring and do what you gotta do. - Hey! - He's fucking with us. You gotta wait. You have to lose. What did you do? Run, let's go. Run. If they catch you they'll kill you. Hit me, you asshole! Hit me! Hit me! How was that? I dunno, ask him. Hey? How was that? Answer! Would my pal make a good boxer? No answer. Get busy. And now a Parma-style risotto as an accompaniment for pork roasted with vanilla and rosemary, and a ratatouille. The buffet is open, please help yourselves. How is it? Salt? Is it salty enough? Michele, what are you doing? Everyone's looking for you. Mingle with the guests, tonight's your night. I want you to meet Robin Schultz, Berlin's top critic. Nice to meet you. The new manager. You couldn't have made a better choice. - Wine? - Yes. Maybe you could lend him to me? How about Thursday? I'm throwing a small party at home. You're a big hit with my friend, he invited you a party at his place. - Is he a fag? - Of course he is. He asked if you're gay. Where were you? I've been waiting three hours. I need the car, I have tons of stuff to do. We work here, get it? Want some wine? No alcohol. Boxer? Sorry? Boxer? No. Nazis, get it? Skins, they beat me up. Fight. No, that's from boxing. What are you doing? Good evening. Excuse me. "The eyes are important for me blah, blah, blah..." "Beauty comes second." Then I see this foxy model with really long hair. Yeah, she was 69 years old! Must have been her eyes that did it. You've got great eyes too. How much? - How much have we made? - 6,000. Let's go. Go, it's dangerous. Go home, Italian. It's for the best. Italian! Are your hands better? Musk oil, alcohol, iodine... laudanum... - An old remedy. - How come you speak Italian? Maria... My wife. We were together for 23 years, then cancer... You trained boxers? Three Olympic medallists and three world champions. All my pupils. In old Yugoslavia you got scholarships to study in East Germany. And so... I train kids from the poor outskirts. As soon as I see that one's got what it takes, I tell him to find a new trainer. And you? I was a boxer in Italy. I wanted to get on the national team for the Olympics. Excuse me kid, but you're not national-level. I have to admit that you've got a powerful right hook, but your technique... Samir... why have you stopped? Who's that? - That's me. - No, it's not you. It's someone else. Don't view yourself, look at yourself. You have to train hard every day. Between the fingers. Watch out, your opponent's like lightning. Good luck. Caroline. Hit me. - Everything okay? - Fine. Everyone wants the window table, I'm going nuts. I'll handle it. Follow me, please. Pour some wine. I'm really sorry... What are you doing? Lout! I'm so sorry, please send me the dry cleaning bill. Go back inside. What's wrong with you? I don't get it. I gave you a job, a new opportunity... I paid you back in full. There's a queue for your job. Goodnight. Everything okay? Good. Max Schmeling, the great German boxer. At the ripe age of 31 he beat the great Joe Louis. Before the match, Max checked out the ring. He realized that the lights were so powerful that the flooring in the ring would get red hot. So by using thermal insoles, Schmeling stopped his feet from frying, while Louis... couldn't move anymore due to the blisters on his feet. Shit! Understand? Now I have to tell you something important. - You'll fight in two months. - There's a tournament? No, it's "the" tournament. You said you'd stopped training at professional level. You'll fight in the Stammring. - An illegal match? - Stammring is pure boxing. You'll be up against the best on the circuit. It'll be tough, but honorable, all according to Queensbury rules. Whose? Michele, all these questions! Whose? Whose? Whose? You have to trust me. If you accept, in the next two months you'll have to train like a world title fighter. The only difference is you won't earn anything. No one knows Stammring's organizers, the last one was 10 years ago. The principle behind it is this: world titles hardly ever correspond to the true worth of boxers. Points don't exist at Stammring. You win by knockout. He vouched for you. The advantage of being an outcast... Finished, now a 30 minute run! - When do we leave? - In 10 days, for Gorzów. In Poland. Listen Michele, you're a man, they're men. They've got the punches, the technique. You've got the punches and this. The time's finally come to see if you're a real boxer. Oh, I almost forgot. If you make it to the final match, it means my work with you is done. Michele, I'm sorry. My condolences. Your grandpa was a good man. Now what? When do you leave? I dunno if I'm leaving. Michele, you can't stay here. They'll kill you. I have to tell you about Germany... - I want to go to the Olympics. - Still? Michele, you're nuts. I took part in the Stammring. - How did you do? - I won. Does that shitty Vespa still work? Rosario... How about a drink? Come inside. You shouldn't have come back. There's no one left here for you. Not true. There's my friend Rosario, isn't there? Who's outside? Salvatore? Did they send you to do the dirty deed? They sent their guard dog. Hey! What do you want from me? I messed up once and I have to pay for it forever? Answer! If you gotta do it, get it over with. What are you talking about? You're my bro. Because life is measured by every fall. Because fighting means not trusting anyone, knowing that it's all uphill, watching your back, remembering who didn't make it. When you understand, you don't just fight for yourself, the title, the cash or the girl you'll marry. You fight for everyone.
