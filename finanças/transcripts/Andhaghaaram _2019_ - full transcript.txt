HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUDDY! HAVE A SPIRITED LIFE! You did not heed my words! He's still inside me… and urges me to cause harm. I'm so terrified! Don't look him in the eye! He's pure evil. I just can't take it anymore! Hello! Hello. Why haven't you met him yet? I've been pleading with you for the past couple of days. Why aren't you meeting him? I was caught up with some work. I beg of you. Please meet him today. Can't you feel my agony? I'm running low on cash. Just meet him and convey the message. He'll pay you enough. Sure. How are you, brother? I'm fine. What about you? I'm good. I was at the library, yesterday but you weren't there. Sorry, I was at the hospital. It's about the book, right? I just came in. I'll have it ready for you. Thanks, bro. Do you remember the name of the book? Days that are gone. Yeah, that's the one. -Selvam. -Sir? -Make an entry for these books as well. -Sure, sir. Selvam, are you preparing for your exams? Will you clear it at least this time? Hopefully, sir. Leave him in peace, buddy. -See you, Selvam. -Okay, sir. -See you, buddy. -Okay. Bro! There is some leftover pizza in the box. Have it. Thanks. -Hello. -Hello, sir. We received a complaint regarding your phone. This is a verification call regarding the same. Is the line clear now? Yes, it's fine now. They fixed it last evening itself. Can I update your complaint status as resolved? The line is clear but the technician who came in has taken away my phone replacing it with an old model phone. It's like an old rotary. Can it be replaced? It's a huge task to dial each time. I get it. But honestly speaking, no one uses landline these days. And even if they did, they usually buy cordless phones. That's why you might've got some old instrument. I'll surely update your request, sir. We'll get the telephone replaced soon. -Okay, sir. No problem. -Hello, sir! How would you rate our service on a scale of one to ten? Eleven-fifteen. Sir? Hello? Sir? What happened? He's disconnecting the call. Does he have any other number? I called his landline number since his mobile phone is switched off. He disconnecting that as well. He'll come. Let's wait. It was a pretty long sleep. To be precise, it took eight months and thirteen days for you to wake up. But, we were all very hopeful. Relax. Don't try to talk and strain yourself. Your voice box was so badly damaged that it had to be extracted. You've lost your voice. But there are many alternatives. We are looking into it. You want to know about the discharge? We'll see about that later. All you need now is, rest. Okay. Something unexpected had happened. Before coming to your clinic… the assailant had gone to your place. No one survived. You've helped so many to cope up with grief through counseling. But now… You know better. Here. Have this. Drink this. Yeah, it's Dr. Vasanth. Is Harish there? This is the "Truevoice" electrolarynx. Best in the market. From now on, this is going to be the voice of Dr. Indran. Initially it will take him some time but eventually, he'll get used to it. There are tons of tutorial videos on YouTube as well. Okay. So, when can I take him home? I can't say anything as of now as he has just woken up. He needs to be kept under observation for a few days. We need to monitor him closely. Besides that… All of us know that he was shot by his own patient. The council has concerns about Dr. Indra's treatment methods. And since he's been in a coma for such a long time, they have doubts about his ability to practice as well. The council can take a walk. Don't you know he's the best we have? It's the council's decision. Not mine. And also, there's something you need to know as his only guardian. The bullet that entered his throat… has also affected his CNS and part of his cerebral cortex. This in turn, has reduced his reasoning capacity. Classical case of post traumatic stress. Correct! But his anger and anxiety levels are way higher. So much that, there's no big difference between him and his assailant. Just because you're authorized to treat him… you think, you can say as you please? Do you know his repertoire? Dr. Indran, is almost an idol. In fact, he's the one who recommended me for my master's scholarship. I want to see him get back to his practice as well. He needs help. It reacts actively and yields Phosphorous acid… "Acid." It's "C" and not "S". And Hydrogen Chloride. The number of electrons in the… Okay, guys. Your next class is right after your first exam. Your first exam is Physics. We've already revised quite a lot. In case you have any doubts, you can call me anytime. Okay? All the best. Do well. Bye. Thank you, teacher. Move a little forward. To your right. Yes. Why didn't you go with your friends today? I have some work in T. Nagar. It's your third attempt, right? Have you prepared well at least this time? Regardless of how much I try I go blank during my exams. What work do you have in T. Nagar? Do you need to buy something? I have to get money from someone. You could've asked me for it. Why are you going that far? No, I'm not going to borrow money. It's my fee. I get paid for my services. But, he insists on meeting the boss in person. What kind of service is it, Selvam? It's something similar to a postman's job. Okay, sir. Who writes letters these days, Selvam? That's why, I deliver messages for the people who can't write. Yes, please. Sir, my name is Selvam. I have an important message for you. Go ahead, please. Sir, it is something personal. If someone else is here besides you… can you… Prem. -Give us two minutes. -Sure. Go on. Sir… yesterday morning, your mother… Sir, please tell him to go and check for himself. I'm telling you the truth. Ask him to-- Mom! Mom! The number you are calling is either switched off or not reachable at the moment. Please try later. Hello. Why haven't you met him yet? I've been pleading with you for the past couple of days. Why aren't you meeting him? I was stuck with some work. I beg of you. Please meet him today. Can't you feel my agony? I'm running low on cash. Just meet him and convey the message. He'll pay you enough. Sure. Number 416. Resolved. Hi, Vinod. -Hi. -How're you? I am fine. Sorry, I got delayed. I got a call while I was just about to leave. -How are you? -All good man. So, what's with the new look? Just like that. Shall we leave? The table won't wait for us. As if the table could read the time. What? Nothing. First of all, wear your seat belt properly. Okay. See you. We don't mind waiting. You may finish your work and come back. No, it's okay. It will take time. -I'm in town until weekend. Call me. -Yeah. -Bye. -Bye. He doesn't even have my number. How will he call me? He's much better now. There's a huge improvement, ever since his former doctor returned. Don't you remember? We consulted a doctor from Nungambakkam. It's the same doctor. He doesn't scream like before. And he eats properly. He seems to enjoy the view. He smiles as well. So? How have you been? How is your work going on? It's going well, sister. I get to train the kids. That is a pretty good job. Hey, I'm in the middle of cooking. Give me ten minutes. The dinner will be ready. Okay. Hey, Vinod. Take him inside, please. Sister! Sister! Vinod? How did he get here? How is he standing? Pradeep! Pradeep! Pradeep! How did this happen, Vinod? I just can't believe this. In the past eight months, he's not even moved a finger. You're here and this happened. I have to inform the doctor about this right away. Hello! Doctor? It's me, Pooja speaking. About five minutes back, Pradeep stood up all of a sudden. All by himself. I'm telling you again. Just leave everything and come with me. Won't you listen to me? Let it go! If you step in, you won't be able to get over those memories. That's why I'm here. Hello? Leela's room is locked. I'm unable to open it. I don't know about it. It might be jammed due to the lack of use. Where's the key? I agreed to everything you said because you were so adamant. Now listen to me and leave alone the room. Key! Don't you hear me? Why do you complicate things unnecessarily? Be right there. I'm coming. I want the key! When have you ever listened to me? You need the key, right? It's over the fridge. Get lost! Good morning. I'm Selvam. Third attempt. Selvam, it's me. Teacher? How come you are here? You know I'm a government employee, right? That's how I'd enrolled myself as a scribe. You're lucky that I'm your scribe for today's exam. Have you prepared well? Yeah, sort of. "State any three characteristics of electromagnetic waves?" Lepton. No, it's neutron. "What is the unit of--" The rays are deflected by an electric field… "What is the ionization energy of an atom?" "Describe the principle, structure and functioning of a tangent galvanometer?" I don't know, teacher. I don't remember properly. Give it a try, Selvam. This is the last question. It carries ten marks. You need to score at least seven more marks to clear the exam. I really don't remember, teacher. Okay, listen to me. You keep talking as if you're giving me the answer. And I will myself write the answer. We don't have an option. I can't do that. It's not right. Then you'll definitely fail. That's alright. I'm content with the marks I deserve. Please don't do that. Or else, there won't be any difference between you… and the cheats who hand out paper to me as currency. I did my best as a teacher, right? Or at least, you could've listened to me. No one would have come to know about it. You might have helped me now but in the next exam… I'll expect the same from someone else. This is not necessary. It's okay to fail. We can at least face it boldly. But if we do something wrong… the guilt will stare right at us. Even if you look away. My dad was a Brake Inspector in the Traffic department. He was an honest man like you. We never got anything but just the salary. One day, while I was on my way to the college, he called me… and asked if I could bring his helmet that he'd left in my bike. But I said that I was already late and asked him to manage without it for just that day. He agreed to it and left. But of all days, he met with an accident on that day. Head injury. He died instantly. I couldn't tell this to anyone and suffered in silence. But every time when someone at the funeral said that… my father would've been alive if only he'd worn a helmet my guilt killed me even more. I finished college and got my father's job on compassionate grounds. Now everyday I go to his office, and sit on the same seat he sat only to be filled with guilt that still haunts me. You are right, Selvam. We can run far from our mistakes. But we can never escape them. If you would ever want to ask something to your father what would it be? The number you're calling is either switched off or not reachable at the moment. Please try later. How many times do I have to call you? It has been switched off since morning. I don't have a phone. Since when? It got damaged in the rain last week. So what? Does that mean you will not buy a new phone? Can't you keep your house clean? It's such a mess. Just like a dungeon. Enough! What's the occasion? Why is your brother in town? His friend is getting married. He's come on a three days leave. He was hell-bent on meeting you. That's why, I had to bring him. Oh. What kind of a reaction is this? Amid his busy schedule, he made time to meet you. But you didn't even talk to him properly. What's wrong with you? Nothing's wrong with me. I'm okay. If that's the case, then why did you walk away when he offered to wait? How rude! Look here, Vinod. You've changed a lot in the past eight months. And we've grown apart. I don't think it's working At least, let's decide the next step, Vinod. There's immense pressure at home and my dad… How do I make you understand? I really don't have-- What? What happened? What happened? Vinod! Why are you behaving like this? Vinod! Who is it? Tell me what it is! Vinod? What's wrong with you? Don't move! Just stay still. I need to see your feet. -What? -Didn't you hear me? -Hey! -Leave me! Hey! What are you doing, Vinod? It's hurting! Leave me! Vinod, leave me! Leave me! Hey! Are you out of your mind? Have you gone nuts? What have you become, Vinod? I'm done with all this. Go to hell! I am already in hell! Please open the gate. What? My office is inside. Sir, I know nothing. I'm newly appointed here. Please call the office for further details. My clinic is inside. I don't know, sir. Please inquire at the office. I've been meaning to tell you at the right time. After that incident… the police had sealed off your clinic. And later the building was sold as well. They didn't even give a proper eviction notice. I heard that the new owner wants to build a mall over there. So, technically the building is shut down now. That means I have to find a new place for the clinic. We'll see about that later. What you need right now, is rest. No! I need to start my practice. My rehab and therapy is my practice. Without that, I'll go mad. Listen to me. We need to submit an evaluation report to the council to prove that you're physically and mentally fit. Only then you can start practicing. What's the problem in that? Don't I look fine? You look fine but you're not. Or else, how would you've failed to clear the evaluation thrice? You don't remember it, right? -May be… may be, the medicines. -Whatever! I'm telling you again. Please understand. You can't start practicing without clearing the evaluation. The Council is very clear. I've sacrificed a lot for this career. I had a late marriage and children. I gave my best until now. Is this what I get in return? If they suspend me from practicing… then I will not spare anyone! Daddy, I'm leaving. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. -I lost my-- -See! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Have you ever reacted like this before? Your mind is not in your control. Be a little patient until you clear the evaluation. Just give it some time. How's it possible? You need to remember that you're a patient and not a doctor. Everything is possible. This is all I could retrieve from your clinic. The investigation team and the press had totally ransacked your clinic. -Thanks. -That's okay. Remember what I said. Next week we are taking a trip to Ooty. P.K will also join us there. Take good rest. Bye. Bye. Selvam! Come with me. Brother? Your wait for a kidney donor is over. Perfect match! I was with the doctor when he went through the file. I checked with him and struck a deal right away. Thanks, bro. If you could shell out 80,000 rupees, then we'll make sure your name gets to the top of that list. The surgery will be done in the next ten days. What do you think? -How will I get the money? -That's not my lookout but get the money ready. Listen to me. You are already undergoing dialysis twice a week. Just think about the cost involved. If you add that up for another six months, it will be more than 80,000 rupees. Do you think you'll last that long? And soon you might have to undergo dialysis everyday and get admitted here. Then, who's gonna pay your bills? You'll be left alone to rot and die. I'm trying to help you out of pity. You better decide soon and let me know by Wednesday. Okay? See you. There's no one who sees the world better than you. Your bills are due, Selvam. I will clear that in a week's time. Please make sure that you do it soon. Plantain stem juice! Have three glasses of juice every day for a month and you would've grown a new kidney. It's a grave sin to go under the knife. Did people get operated thousand years ago? Stay away from this sham. Sir. This is the one, right? Exactly! There was a Judgment in 1956 which is going to be the base of my argument. Good Lord. Thanks, Selvam. Sir. Tell me, Selvam. Do you remember what I told you about my operation? If I get around 80,000 rupees… Sorry, Selvam. I'm so broke that I don't even have 80 rupees to fill fuel. They've hiked the price by two rupees. I think I'll have to walk to the court everyday. What will you do if you don't find me? Will you search for me? Have it. Good shot! I'm not mad at you but just a bit worried for you. I get it. But you know what I've been through. Don't you ever mention Pradeep's name again. He's a total psycho. Even if you hadn't given him that book, he would've found it. You have to come out of this. You need to forget everything and become confident. We can always get some help, if you need it. What do you mean? A psychiatrist. No. I don't need it. Please listen to me. Psychiatrists are trustworthy. You can trust them. They can help you deal with your fear and confusion. You might even find another side to yourself through them. What do you mean? What if you're a cricket trainer by day and a bloodhound at night who calls random people and kills them? Hey, I'm just kidding. Why are you so serious? Look at you! -Hello! -Dr. Indran? Yeah, speaking. Doctor, I need… an appointment… for consultation. Why? What's the issue? Since the past few days, I have been sensing a weird presence in my room. I keep getting intrusive thoughts. I become angry for no reason and think of unwanted stuffs. Sometimes, I lose control over myself. I'm scared if things would soon get out of hand. Then, let's not waste time. Let's start the consultation today itself. Evening 8:00 p.m. at your place. Please text me your address. Sorry, doctor, I don't have a cellphone. I only have a landline. Tell me your address. I'll note it down. Vinod. 298, Jayalaxmi apartments Anna Nagar, west Chennai 101. Hello! Hello. You should've never given me that book. That's where it all started! Pradeep? That's why, even the end is coming for you. Don't think that you have hidden your trail. I know I made a mistake. I'm sorry. No matter where you run or however hard you try to hide you can never escape from this. Pradeep? Hello! Please pick up. Sir, number 297? -It's the next door. -But it's locked? Here's 2,100 rupees. Keep this for now. I've been asking around. So, don't lose hope. I already owe you a lot. I don't know how I'm going to pay you back. That's alright. I wish I could give you more. But wishing alone isn't enough, right? How much more do you need? Somewhere around… 75,000 rupees. What shall we do? If we had your father's manuscripts, we could've made some money. But I've destroyed them and there's nothing left behind. But how is it of any use anyway? There was a publication that wanted to publish them as a book. They offered a large amount but your dad didn't budge. Even the owner kept pestering. The publication was called Broadway. It was in Triplicane. Don't worry, Selvam. We will find a way out. -Selvam! -Sir. Aren't you leaving? No, sir. I need to take a backup of the journal entries. I'll leave soon. I have a wedding to attend. I'm leaving. Be careful. -Take care. -Okay, sir. Dear, light up the mosquito coil. Okay, sir. Come on, faster. Hello! Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you all day but your phone was busy. Sorry. I just got back from coaching. The receiver was not placed properly. I called you this morning at around 11:00 a.m. The phone kept ringing but no one attended the call. I wasn't home. I was at the hospital. What happened? Is Pradeep not feeling well? Vinod. Pradeep passed away this morning. What are you saying? Did he die? How did this happen? It was around 10:15-- I got a call exactly ten minutes after I left for work. I was informed that he jumped off the terrace. I always keep the doors locked. I don't know how he managed to get out. What could've made him do so? Hello? What time did it happen? It was at 10:15 a.m. Are you sure about it? Can you please try and recall? Vinod, is it something that I would forget? Please! Sorry, sister. I'm too confused right now. It's okay. Do you have his phone book in your room? I need his contacts to inform them about his death. It's okay, sister. We used to share the same phone book. I know his handwriting. I'll inform his contacts. Thanks, Vinod. Okay. Take care. Hello! Sir, I'm your batchmate Pradeep's friend, Vinod. I got your number from his phone book. There's a bad news. Pradeep passed away this morning. Around 10:15 a.m. It was unexpected. No one saw this coming. Sure, ma'am. I'll convey this to his sister. Thank you, sir. I don't have the exact details. But it was an accident. I met him recently and he seemed absolutely fine. Hello! Hello? Tell me. Sir, I'm Pradeep's friend, Vinod. I found your number in his phone book. There's a bad news. What is it? Did you call to say that you're behind your friend's death. Hello, who's this? You think, you can hide your crime, just like that piece of paper? How do you know about this? No matter how many pages you tear but your name is etched in every single page. Who are you? Open your door. Sorry, I'm late. Is the doctor here? Hey. Why are you here with the bat? -What's happening? -Nothing. Did you see someone going this way? No, I didn't. Hey! Did the doctor come or not? No. I don't think he'll come. How do you know that? He might be stuck in traffic. -He'll come. Let's wait. -Not here. No! Why? I'll tell you. It's a bit weird. What if the doctor comes? Doesn't matter. Let's leave from here first. -Hey, tell me! -Come! I don't get it. You're saying that he died around 10:00 a.m. How will he call you at 11:00 a.m.? Do you remember the exact time? I was late to the coaching by an hour. That's when I got the call. How can this be possible? I somehow feel… you're imagining things. How can someone imagine to this extent? Don't get me wrong. There are so many stuffs like hallucination, lucid dreaming and so on. Did you really call the doctor? If I didn't, how would I get his appointment for 8:00 p.m.? I was at your place on time but he didn't show up. You didn't allow me to call him as well. Tell me honestly. Is this all your imagination? Won't you ever believe me? Why don't you call and check for yourself? Fine! Give me the number. Nine, eight, eight… four, two… eight, six, double two, nine. Sorry. Two, one, nine. The number you are calling is either switched off or out of network coverage area. Please try later. It is not reachable. Is this really his number? Why do you doubt me? I don't know if this is all true or your imagination. Then, what about the person, who threatened me over phone? Who's he? Is he also my imagination? What if you'd really got the doctor's appointment and he is a character you created to stop you from meeting him? So, you're fully convinced that I'm a total nutcase. No! Not actually. Doctor. We never expected that you'd ever come back. If you'd informed us, we would've come. That's okay. Since the clinic is under renovation, I visit my patients at their place. From now on, I will be coming on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5:00 p.m. I'll be here. But considering that you were in a coma and that you might not practice again, we've already started consulting another doctor. He is not as renowned as you but he's also quite competent. The waiting time is less and fees is also affordable. If my fees is your concern, I can even waive it. My practice and my patients are more important to me. But doctor, how could we just switch over like that? Besides, there's a lot of improvement after visiting him. -He even walks without-- -Coffee? I just can't believe this, doctor. How is it possible in one day? It has the exact amount of sugar that I would prefer. He used to make such a coffee when we were newly married. It was around 20 years ago. But… how does he remember it now? Memory! It's a monster. There are ways to unleash it. Most importantly… it should be handled only by the person who can control it. Well we're done with the first session. Just wait until the end of seven sessions. There will be remarkable changes. You'll see it. No one reads books these days. The only book in demand today is Facebook. With the advent of internet and stuffs, we've even tried printing porn. But no one bought them. Imagine the plight of ghosts and paranormal stuff. 20 years ago, I'd approached your father when these stuffs were popular. Had he accepted, we could've made some quick bucks. He refused to it. Poor guy met his doom. He lost his house and suffered a tragic death. The house is still there. I still live there. The one in Royapettah? Yes, sir. Good Lord! Isn't it worth millions? What are you doing here with this worthless junk? The house is the only thing I have in my father's memory. Many wanted to buy at the cost I demanded for. But I refused. So, what do you do for a living? I'm a clerk in the government library. Aren't you interested in your father's field of work? It's not that, sir. At times, I act as a medium. Oh. So, can you communicate with the souls? Impressive! I have a task for you. Let me know if you're interested. One of my friends wanted to build a shopping mall in downtown and bought an old building. Only after buying, he realized there's some sort of a presence in there. It's haunted. He was spooked by an occultist who ranted about vengeful spirits and demons. He hired few exorcists to purge the building. But nothing worked out. If you can do this, then he will pay you 1,00,000 rupees. I'll surely try, sir. I can't rely on that. Have you ever done something like this? I haven't, but as a kid I've accompanied my father many times. Are you a novice? You know nothing about darkness. I've known nothing, but darkness. I'll handle it. Sir, I think this book might be in the second rack of the upper deck. The clerk hasn't turned up today. Either come tomorrow or try finding it yourself. Please! Okay, sir, thank you. Sir, please leave the bag and go. Selvam, you said you wanted a day off. But you're here already! I got done with my work. -That's why, I came in. -Thank God, Selvam. There's been tons of returns today. I was struggling to do it manually. I am not a computer savvy like you. So, what's with the bag? It's just books -for my evening class. -Okay. Did you find the book, sir? No, sir. I didn't. Come tomorrow. I'll keep it ready for you. What book, sir? -It's a Leo Tolstoy's book. -Oh! It's a good book. -But it's name-- -Is it War and Peace? Am I that dumb? What about Anna Karenina? It's just a single word. What was its name? Devil? Yes! That's the one. How did I forget that? Hello? Hello, who's this? Are you sure you want to know? Yes. Who the hell are you? I was a human like you. But now, I'm not. Don't you have a name? I had a name but not anymore. Is that why you annoy me to death? I haven't done anything to you yet. Listen. I don't know who you are. You aren't telling me as well. Either you're deliberately pulling a prank on me. Or a psycho, calling random numbers and torturing them. Doesn't matter. But you're my right pick for a wrong guy. What do you want? I want to talk that too with the soul of a weakling like you. Am I a weakling? What nonsense! Yes. You are a weakling. That's okay. Let me be. I won't. Not until I free your wonderful soul from your frail cage of a body. Hey, are you crazy? Reciting lines from some stupid soap! You might've heard your soul recite the same everyday. But today for the first time, you're hearing it in my voice. The right to bind your soul and control it, is not yours anymore. Who are you to say this? I'm your soul's representative. Gone are the days when your soul begged you for freedom. Henceforth, I'll be talking to you on its behalf. And I will not stop until your soul is set free from it's weak cage. You think you're invincible? I have your number. The cyber cell would track you in seconds. Do you think you are man enough just because you crouch in a dark corner of a dirty room and talk to strangers in riddles? Add a defunct green refrigerator to your description. Yeah, that's right. Hey. This way. Careful, dear. Okay, I've got to call you back. Hey, take him to the room. Okay, sir. Be careful. There's a staircase. Hey! Who the hell is he? Why him of all people? Do you think the spirit is going to show mercy on the blind boy? Sir, don't judge him by his looks. His father used to be an expert occultist. He even crossed the high seas to cast out a white devil. Trust me. He'll surely do it. Are you nuts? Do you remember what happened to the others who came here? Despite bribing the cops and press, it took six months for me to hush up things. Who will be answerable if something goes wrong? Will you? So what? Do we hold a funeral if a dog gets killed in an accident? Don't we run over the carcass and move ahead? Nobody's going to be bothered about him. Let him try. What are we going to lose? I have lost 5,00,000 rupees until now. We'll pay that only if the job is done. But, you took your share beforehand, right? Sir! That's why you're inside the car with the AC on while I am serving you under the scorching sun. Hello! I've pressed the button. You just have to go inside and close the door. The lift will automatically take you to the sixth floor. Go straight. You have to go to the last room. Here is the room key. -Hello. -I am here at a place. Can you call me exactly in seven minutes without any questions? Where? Whose number? I'll tell you. Note down the number. Okay, tell me. Two, four, two, two… -Okay. -four, four, nine, two. Call me exactly in seven minutes. Okay, I will. I know there's someone out here. But you're not supposed to be here. You know that as well. If you're trapped here… or dwell here… then I'm here to pacify you and to set you free. If you trust me and have the desire to free yourself… then stand on this chakra and reveal your presence. I asked you to call me! Why didn't you call me? I specifically asked you to call me in seven minutes. I did call to that number. Whose number is that? Why? What happened? Someone spoke over the phone and said you're in some sort of a danger. What's all this? What's happening, Vinod? Vinod? -I'll call you later. -Hello? Oh. So, there's one more of you. I'm here to-- Hey, go and open the gate! Go and get the car! Shut down the power! No one can be here. Go! Wait, I'll call you. It's me. What happened? I couldn't do it. I need some more time. Careful. Here, take this. Get some medicines. I'll call you later. Why did you step out of your car, sir? Did you see that? He hardly lasted for ten minutes. What sort of an exorcist is he? Sir, do you remember that Nambhoodri with 30 years of experience from Kerala? He went inside with a magical scroll, with spells cast for 144 days. But we just found the scroll in the end, right? It took us a day to scrape out his body from that wall. But this boy has come out alive, right? He's promised to be back. He will! Trust me. Sir, do you remember that Nambhoodri with 30 years of experience from Kerala? But we just found the scroll in the end, right? Thank you for letting me into your mind. Human mind, a labyrinth of mysteries. Things you can see, hear and feel are alien to this society. That's why people consider you crazy. But every day, I enter your mind and people call me… doctor. There's nothing wrong with you. In other words, there's nothing right with them. This society that pretends and camouflages by the minute and considers money, fame, and women as the only source of happiness has no answer for your joy, that needs no source. Yet, it brands you as crazy, insane, unstable and crushes you through humiliation. It's foolish to expect them to be fair and understanding because the sole reason the world invented the sixth sense is to just put up a facade. This mob that hides its body in robes and identity under masks perceives you as mere animals that need to be chained. But what they've forgotten is the history, when these animals used to rule the world. You need a world that respects you does not humiliate you and alienate you. A world where there is balance. The world that sees your scribblings as paintings and setbacks as achievement is the perfect last page that makes all the other pages of your life, meaningful. That's where I am going to take you all, by breaking your shackles. Not one after another but all at the same time. For that, you need to be patient and follow my command. From now on, you have to stop worrying about this world and be mindful of the honor and joy that await you. If you do so, I'll take you to that world real soon. Trust me! You're in for a journey of a life time. This is Chepauk railway station. Selvam! The solution to all your problem is chasing you in a bottle. Be careful. The solution to all your problems is chasing you in a bottle. Be careful. The solution to all your problems-- Selvam! The solution to all your problems is chasing you in a bottle. Be careful. Hello? You seem to be very inquisitive to know about me. How does it matter to me? Stop calling me. Then stop knocking on wrong doors. What are you talking about? I didn't go anywhere. Then what were you doing climbing up the ladder and peeping in? I went there to convey my friend's death news. -I tried to reach the-- -Listen to me. Don't think I'd keep calm, and let you do whatever. Okay. Henceforth, I'll not bother you and you will also stop calling me. Let's end this here. Okay? Why do you sound so low today? This is my first breakthrough. Why do you torture me? What have I done to you? Didn't I tell you yesterday itself? I'm here to liberate your soul from your weak-- Hello! Why did you disconnect the call, you coward? I'm not a coward. The call got disconnected. Then why are you trying to hide behind that book? I'm not hiding from anyone. This is not a normal book. It might mean anything to you. But to me, it's just a book with 1266 pages. That's it. Like any other book this one has a last page. You can try and hide behind it but what will you do when you run out of pages? If you're man enough, then why did you end the call? Hello, chief! Sorry. Have you been waiting for long? No. I just came in. So, how are you? I expected you last week. You missed your session, chief. Yeah I was a bit busy. I was trying to be away from everything just the way you told me. I think Dr. Vasanth would've told you. As you might know chief, the council-- I need to start my practice. There's nothing you don't know. The council is very strict. They will not change their decision. But I don't care about them. How can you say so, chief? I even exempted you from counseling and directly gave you the questionnaire. Not once, but thrice. But you didn't clear it. Then I even tried entering your subconscious mind but that didn't work as well. You're too strong, chief. Then concede defeat and clear my evaluation report. It's not my fault. A patient's cooperation is crucial in the healing process. But you still behave more like a doctor than a patient. Now you've accepted that I am a doctor and not a patient. You're too good, chief. But if you attend just two more sessions I'll surely enter your mind, no matter what. I'm telling for your own good. Don't! Do you think I can't? I'm saying you shouldn't. When was the last time you visited a zoo? While I did my Master's in the U.S. The Columbus zoo. Why? Were there any tigers? Yes. There were seven or eight of them inside a big cage. What did you see when you looked into the cage? What else? Tigers, of course. What did you look like to the tigers? How else would I look? Just like any other person. Now imagine! You're inside the tiger's cage. What would you see now? Obviously, tigers. And how would you look like to the tigers now? Doctor, your lunch is ready. I'll call you. That was a wild one, chief. I didn't see it coming. Now, let's turn the tables. If you were inside the tiger's cage, how else would you appear to them? Master! Please take everything and get out of my sight. How many times I've told you not to get into this stuff? How did you get this book? You only said that we could sell my father's book. That was just a thought! But why do you want to know what's inside? Have you forgotten all that's happened to your dad and me? He lost everything and died. And I-- I'm made a scapegoat for someone's crime. And I can't even use my real name. I rot here in this run down theater, doing nothing! I thought you were sweeping, Uncle. Oh, you think it's funny? I'm telling you again. Don't get into all this. Your life will become a mess if you try to know what's inside the book. I don't have an option, Uncle. I have to go through this suffering and die. I'd say that's a better option. Go! You're adamant just like your dad. That's why you pay no heed to my words. Hey, fool! Since you've decided to die… come and have a meal at my place. Selvam, don't think I'm being unreasonable. I am actually worried for you. You might not realize it now. But, trust me… there's nothing worth seeing in this world right now. You might not understand now but someday you'll realize. This is just the same. Though it looks like a blessing, but it's a curse. You don't need this. Uncle! If I don't go back home today, I have no one to look out for me. Even if something happens to me, there's no one who'd be bothered. Despite all this, do you know why I want to live? A son's duty is to take care of his parents during their old age. But I have none. The least I could do is to protect the house they lived in. For that, I have to somehow manage to live on. Despite eating what you've cooked. Passport or full size, sir? Maxi. Chin down, please. A little to your left. A little. Okay. Just a second. Chin up! Okay. When can I collect the photo? It will be ready in about 30 minutes. Won't you even pick up the newspapers? How would I know? I hardly step out of the house. But Harish told me that you visited him recently. Yeah. But, that was a few days back. -I would've come along with you. -I didn't want to disturb you. Anyway, there's only two more sessions left -and the evaluation will be done. -Alright. Coming to the point. Did you decide anything about the Ooty trip? You think I need a vacation? I'm already on one. -Drink? -No, I have to drive. Hello! Hello, doctor. It's me Pooja. Pradeep stood up about five minutes back all by himself! I just don't know how. Doctor, can you please come immediately? It'd be great if you could check on him now. Okay. Who's it? The insurance company. They need clarification on few bills. Asked me to mail them. Okay. I stopped by to give you this. Kavitha has cooked for you. Have it. -Bye. -Bye. Try visiting often, Vinod. Pradeep will feel a lot better. Sure, I will. Hello, doctor. Good evening. Thanks for coming in such a short notice. It's okay. Not a problem. This is Vinod. He is Pradeep's schoolmate. He's come to visit him. -Hi. -Hello! In fact, I think Pradeep's got all excited on seeing him. Interesting! Doctor, please go in. Pradeep is in his room. -I'll be back in a minute. -Alright, bye! -What's wrong with his voice? -Didn't I tell you? No. He was shot by his own patient. It's a horrible story. -Shot him? -Poor guy. His whole family got wiped out. When did this happen? About a year back. It was all over the papers. Sad. -From this book? -Yes. -It seems very old, Selvam. -Yes. It belongs to my father. Yaksha Thandhiram. Which page in this? It's somewhere in the middle. There's an image of a chakra. Is it from there? Please go to the next page. There's a goat-like image. -Yes, that's the one. -Okay. And the next four pages after this. Is it urgent? Absolutely. Hey, somebody dropped this for you. Hello! I heard that you require a room. It's a 400 square feet flat. It's a small room, but it can accommodate two. There's no extra cot, sir. Hello? It's a tug-of-war That we play within This is the one. No, sir. There's no covered car parking. Sir, North facing? I don't know, sir. I've to check and find out. Sir, pets? I've no problem with your food habits. There's no air-conditioner. But there's a ghost to give you chills! I don't think the candidate is going to turn up now. You may leave if you wish. It's okay, sir. I'll wait for a while. Okay. The door shuts down but the cold rushes in He knows the poles of new moon And never misses his mark In the flicker of the dying light He emerges out of the dark Will he come? Will he come? Will he come? It's only time he drops his guise As I await with gazing eyes The time is running out And darkness is his clout It's only time he drops his guise As I await with gazing eyes The time is running out And darkness is his clout Hi, I'm Dr. Vasanth I am Dr. Indran's friend. I'm here for an evaluation. Can I please take a few minutes of yours? -Sure, please come in. -Thank you. How is the patient related-- Okay. How long have you been consulting with Dr. Indran? About two years back we had consulted him for my brother's depression. His condition improved and he got better. But eight months ago, when he became like this we once again tried reaching the doctor. Only then we got to know about the incident and his hospitalization. But ten days back he called up and came to our house. Like a Godsent. There's a lot of improvement now. How many sessions has he completed? Four, including today. Do you see any improvement after these four sessions? Definitely! Earlier, he used to scream a lot. It would be hard to control him but not anymore. He's become very calm now. I just hope he gets better. Okay. Hello? I know you're using my fear to confuse me. If the phone came forward, it might be due to a loose screw. I might've forgotten, finishing the card castle. How can you claim it's your work? You're just feeding on my fear. If you're all that powerful, tell me what card I've got in my pocket. Are you testing me? Cut to the chase and answer me, you fraud. I might even be a fraud but never a joker like you. I knew that you'll come up with some nonsense. Now I clearly know who you are. Check the card and you'll know who you are. Hey, Manasi. I sent you a photo, right? Can you tell me what card I was holding? Are you nuts to call me at midnight to ask this? It was a joker. Don't lie to me. It was eight of spades, right? Why do you call me if you don't believe me? The card was of a joker. But if you'll spare me the pain, I'll go with eight of spades. -Enough, please! -Hello? -Who's this? Hello? -Please leave me alone. -I agree that I am I'm nothing. -Hello, sir! What do you want, sir? Who are you? -Who are you? -My name is Manoj, sir. Have you ever been to the recharge shop near Meenakshi college? I work there. I don't know. Then you might've dialed wrongly. No. I need to know who you are. Please give me your number. Why do you need my number? Besides, if you want to talk, can't you talk now? No. Not on this phone. I'll call you myself. My whole life depends on you. Please help me. Sir, honestly I don't understand what you're saying. Alright, anyway please note down my number. -Ninety, eight… -Just one second. Ninety, eight… This is my number. Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay, sir. I'm hanging up. -Hello. -Hello! Sir, it's me, Selvam. I've completed the task successfully. What are you saying? Are you sure? Yes, sir. You can even have it checked. Just hold on for a second. The boy says he's cleansed the place. Get it checked. So, where are you right now? I'm in the by-lane next to Saravana Theater. Just wait there. My guys will pick you in ten. Sir, shall I wait inside the theater? It will be easy for them to spot me. Alright. Wait there and don't go anywhere. -See you soon. -Okay, sir. Is this how you hold the tape? -Yeah, tell me. -The dog is calm. Looks like the place is clear. Treat the dog to a few biscuits and buy a sweet box for the owner. Sure. Rocky! Come on. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Hello? Uncle, where are you? I'm at the market for some work. You're at the theater, right? I'm running late. Open the counter and start issuing tickets. -I'll join you soon. -How long will you take, Uncle? I will be back. What's the matter? Uncle… I… I've caught it. Caught what? The one I told you about the other day. I've caught that in a bottle. Bottle? How did you do that? I found the technique in the book I bought. Are you out of your mind? I asked you to not do such a thing! But you never listen to me! Where did you bury it? Bury? There was nothing mentioned about burying. It's still with me. What the hell are you doing with it? When did you catch it? Around fifteen to twenty minutes ago. Be precise, you moron! You can control it for one naazhigai. -What does that mean? -24 minutes. It has to be buried along with salt within that time. Or else, it will try to come out and things will unfold in its favor. I'll go bury it somewhere right away. -Don't worry. I'll be back in an hour. -Hello! Who's that? Who's that? Mr. Ravi had sent us. Come, let's go. I need to go. Tell him that I'll call later. That can wait. For now, come with us. Hey, listen to me. I can't come now. -Yes, boss. -Did you find the boy? Yes, sir but I guess he sensed something. We'll be there in an hour. No need for that. The job is done. Just make him sign the documents. -Hey, am I clear? -Yes, boss. Hey! I have to go! Is this what you ran for? Come, let's get him. Guys! Look at his choice of weapon! Please spare me. I won't spare you! Hey! Is there any medicine in the car? Or, go find a pharmacy and get me a bandage. What are you looking at? Don't create a scene like you're dying. What do you know about pain? It is a deep cut! Hey! Won't you guys go? Won't you? Saravana! Tell them to go! Why did you stab him? Who asked you to do it? You, moron! Go and get the documents from the car. Just go, man! Hey. I'll wait in the car. Hey! It's left thumb. Come, let's go. Hey! Hey! What do I do with this? It's up to you. Do as you please. My house… You punk! Die! Die! I will… Just wait and watch what happens to you now! In the whirl… Of darkness… Sleeps… A weary dream A memory cries Hey! Hey! Enjoy the movie. It's 3D. And becomes a sheer poetry On a quest to save humanity's day, we play hide and seek with life. While fear clouds the sunny day… the twilight rules at the end of the day. It is called an ungrateful soul. Yet we try to grapple and hold. Yet we try to grapple and hold. -every suffering becomes a myth. -What are you doing here? Hey! Hey! Don't you want to go home? Hey, Selvam! Hey, Selvam! Selvam! Selvam. Selvam! Selvam! In the whirl… Have you met that boy before? -No, sir. -Hey! The opposite cycle shop guy told me that he used to come here often. I might've seen him a couple of times while issuing tickets, sir. Other than that, I know nothing about him. Come on, man! Don't you have a better answer? How else can we find his identity? Wasn't there any address or details in his pocket? They've completely wiped out everything from him, heartless animals. Get his name, address and phone number. -Has Jeyapal left the station? -Yes, sir. He's on his way. You'll have to come to the station tomorrow. -Don't leave town. -Okay, sir. Or else, we'll have to come after you. Sukumaran. Are you from Kerala? Yes, sir. I will take your leave. I melt away like The waning moon, mindlessly I'm swept away by A dark tide, ruthlessly I fade away Without a trace, unfairly Of darkness… Sleeps… A weary dream A memory… Cries To awaken it And becomes sheer poetry Do you have a photo of him? I don't have anything, sir. How old is he? Twenty five. Visually challenged. How would I know who called me from your phone, sir? It was you who spoke to me over the phone. And also, you say that there's just you in that room. What if it was a cross talk? No way. That's not possible. I saw the number dialing with my own eyes. Have you searched everywhere thoroughly? Most of the missing people end up being in a friend's house. No, sir. We've looked around thoroughly. Besides, he's got nobody. He never goes out without informing his friends. About four days ago, he spoke to him over phone. Since then, we have no news about him. Have you lost someone dear to you recently? Four days ago… a report of an unidentified body was recorded at the Triplicane station. He was of the same age you'd mentioned. -Take a look at it for formality-- -It's not necessary, teacher. It won't be him. Sir, is this the way you handle a missing person's case? Recently… about eight months ago, I lost my friend. Selvam. Do you know the Maternity Hospital at Royapettah? -Yeah. -He lived in an old bungalow near that. Manoj… can you please wait at the bench outside? I'll file a complaint and join you. Okay, teacher. Sir. It's his birthday in three days. We've even ordered a cake to surprise him. Please find him for us. What happened, sir? He was murdered. I don't know what went wrong. He was brutally stabbed with a broken bottle in broad daylight. You might've read it in the newspapers. Where was your friend working? Do you know the government library opposite to the passport office? Yeah, the old one. He was working there as a clerk for four years. Do you know Selvam's phone number? Yes, I do. Two, four, two, two-- Four, four, nine, two. Correct, sir. It's the same number. How did you know? I'll tell you. Do you have a photo of him? Do you have a group photo? We don't have photographs in Braille. Can I use your phone? Need to call my office urgently. Sure. Go Ahead. Until yesterday, it was just an unidentified body. But today, it's got a name. Selvam. The empathy you both have showed as a teacher and as a friend has surely made the face on the photo an unforgettable one. Sorry, I couldn't connect. Thanks. Sir, one minute. Sir, you dialed Selvam's number instead of your office, right? I know. Even I call that number every now and then. It used to ring continuously. Sometimes I've even felt as if someone picked my call. I know he's not around… but somehow, I still feel his presence. How do you know Selvam? Is he your school friend? No. Call friend. Does he always sit in front of the TV? No, doctor. Not until recently. When I met him recently, I found a lot of changes in him. He spoke with a lot of clarity. Also, he never mentioned about meeting you until I asked him. But then I grew suspicious and followed him. I found that he's been visiting his old patients without a license! How many times has Dr. Indran visited him? Twice, I think. Do you notice any abnormal changes in him? He seems a lot happier these days. Something is not right, Harish. What's the status of his evaluation? Two sessions are over. There are high chances that he might clear in the next-- No! Don't clear him. He shouldn't practice. Something terrible is going to happen. Is that why you look disturbed? That doesn't matter now, Harish. I visited all of his patients. There's a drastic improvement in all of them. That's not normal. I doubt if this was possible even while he was practicing. See, that explains everything. -He's back. -No, Harish. His patients seem really happy. Why do you complain about the good things? -Laughter yoga, laughter therapy-- -You'll understand only if you see them. Not just one or two. But all five of them had that same peculiar smile. That laughter… How do I say it? It's a weird smile. It looked as if… It… Now you can also smile. Did you try calling the doctor after that day? There's a lot happening around. I forgot about it. What is this place? Why did you bring me here? Nobody can hear us amid the noise. What is it? I've found out who he is. His name is Selvam. He used to work as a clerk in the government library. Eight months ago, he was murdered by someone. How did you find it? His friend told me over the phone. How did you know his number? I don't know his number, but I spoke to him. That's what I'm asking, how? The phone dialed by itself and the call got connected. I know where this is heading. First, it was the phone that moved by itself. Then it was the cards that arranged on its own And now you're telling me that the phone dials by itself. People spend millions to do all this in graphics. -Are you not going to believe me? -How can I believe you? If he's torturing you so much, why are you living in that room? And even if you are living there, why don't you mind your own business? Why are you calling random people? If someone attacks you directly, you can identify him and avoid him. But I know nothing about him or his motive. And he knows everything about me. Then, why are you still there? Do you think he'll spare me if I try to escape? Should I give you an instant solution? Go to the shop and buy a new mobile phone. Matter solved! I can avoid the landline at home. But if I have a mobile phone, it will always be with me. You seem to have a problem for every solution. Until now, I thought you're stuck in this game. But now I realize that you're after it. That's why you don't want this to end. Do you know what my coach said during my first day of practice? "Play till the end." Didn't the same coach tell you another important thing? "Know your opponent." Correct. And I'm almost there. I know his name, number and the house that he lived in. But now I'll know his motive and the reason for his outrage. I will find him and know him in ways an opponent shouldn't. I will! 7th May, 2019. Third day of the lunar month. It's 9:13 p.m. Number 426. Until now, I've never spoken to anyone for my sake. This is the first time. And this is not for me but for my teacher. It's for your daughter. Pooja? What happened to her? Her mind is always disturbed. Why? What's the reason? It's a small thing. But your answer to her question may help her overcome her grief. What is it? Please tell me. She thinks she is the reason behind your death and regrets it every single day. She wants to know if you'll forgive her for that. My God! It was not at all her mistake. It was me who forgot to wear a helmet. I don't know why but my mind was restless that day. I didn't even realize that I jumped the traffic signal. It was entirely my mistake. Poor girl. Rather, she is doing a job that has nothing to do with her dreams and shoulders the family responsibilities. It's she who has to forgive me for that. Can you please pass my message to her, son? I love her and I'll always be watching over her. Number 426. Resolved. Yeah, I remember meeting the boy. You're right. About ten days ago… he was here with his father's books to get them published. But, I talked some sense into him and sent him back. But he's written in his journal that you had offered him a job. Yeah, I offered him a job of a lift operator. But he refused the offer. What happened to that boy? He died five days back. What? Poor guy. It's unbelievable. How did it happen? Somebody… for some unknown reason has murdered him. My God! Can I help you with some money for his funeral? No, sir. I'll leave now. Why is your company's board hanging outside his gate? How else am I supposed to recover the money from him? What else did he have? By the way, who are you? How are you related to him? I'm his teacher. Only students can raise questions. Teachers should just mind their business. If you still need an answer, ask the dead guy to come over. I'll answer him. Now get lost! Get lost! Hey, who's at the Royapettah house? Some girl had been there and is asking me unwanted questions. Send somebody and have it checked. Hello! Doctor, your friend is here. He doesn't like me smiling. Doctor? I feel bad since he is my friend. But he won't feel any pain. Okay. Proceed. Thanks, doctor. I'm sending your approval letter to the council right away. I'll also be mailing you the list of my patients. Please take good care of them. Sure. Hello! What do you think of yourself? Do you think I'll tolerate you forever? Is that why despite living a pathetic life you wanted to record it and watch? I know who you are! You are Selvam! Why are you ruining my life if you got killed? Even if you rewind every frame of the 28 years of your worthless life and recall every single face that you've seen you'll still never get close to finding me. Not even my shadow. I know that you'll never have the guts to face me. Hello! Selvam! If you have the guts, then come and face me! Car parking is that way. The place is well ventilated. Please wait downstairs for five minutes. What the hell are you doing? Time and again it's become your habit to humiliate me. Why have you stuck papers all over the room? Like always. What do you mean? Did he come to your room and do this? Just say something! It's not what you think. When I was about to break the camera in anger… I think it accidentally got recorded. Did you try breaking the camera? Is that what you do when you get angry? The camera is mine! Exactly. That's why I didn't break it. If it was mine, I would've definitely broken it. But why didn't I break it? What stopped me? A "purpose" that I have to return it to you. That's the kind of "purpose", I don't have in my life. This is what he's been highlighting all along. And I'm ruining my life without realizing it. What does he gain out of this? Because he wants to break me into pieces. He gets pleasure out of it. A cheap thrill! The one who tried to break the camera was "him". And "I" am the reason for my anger. This camera is my life. So, he's trying to use my anger as a medium to destroy my life. That's his master plan. Don't you get it? He could've done anything to me as and when he wanted. He could've even dropped the fan on my head and killed me while I was asleep. But he didn't because that's not his intention. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So, he decides my reaction and acts accordingly. There's only one way to get to him. I shouldn't display the reaction that he needs. To destroy a bowler, you don't need to hit fours and sixes on every ball. You just need to play defense with disdain. He'll be finished. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. I've decided to step out of the house. The guy waiting outside is calling me. I am leaving. For heaven's sake, please don't carry the phone along with you. Hello? How are you, teacher? S-Selvam? The roadkill rodents that you see everyday were once safe inside a house. The day it got curious to see the outer world it died. Thanks. Now, buzz off. -What if I say "No"? -Doesn't matter. You can't stop me from anything. Do you think you can scare me with all this? I'm leaving this house. Try stopping me! What's all this, Selvam? What's happening? How're you talking on the phone? I'm talking to you in the same way I talked to your father. Hello! Hello! Watchman! Help! Watchman! Please! Who did this to you, Selvam? Please tell me. It's the press owner, right? No, teacher. My situation forced me to do this. That's how I died. The number you're calling is not reachable at the moment. Hello! Sister, it's me, Vinod. Tell me, Vinod. How're you? Can you please come to my place? Why? What happened? It's an emergency. What is it? I'll tell you in person. Okay. I'll be there in 20 minutes. -Okay, sister. Thanks. -It's okay. Bye. Change! Change! Eight! Why didn't you ever tell me that you were a medium? I'm not the medium, teacher. If you weren't the medium, then how did you talk to spirits? It's because the phone is the medium. That's how I was able to communicate with the spirits. Otherwise, I was just an ordinary person. The spells and occult stuffs are things I picked up from my father. That's where it went wrong. Were you in lot of pain during your final moments? Did you suffer? More than my death… my inability to protect my father's house was painful. You need to do something for me. Will you do it? Lock the room. Who's that? Vinod, its me Pooja. Open the door. Sister, the door is locked from outside. Is there a spare key with the neighbor. The key is with me. I'll throw it through the window. Can you open it? Throw it. -What happened, Vinod? -Give me your phone. Tell me what it is! Vinod! Who are you calling? Vinod! How do you have his number in your phone? Selvam! Selvam was my student. How do you know him? This is the guy I was searching for. He's the one calling me and torturing me. How can he call you? It's been eight months since he died. Hello! Hello! Selvam? Hello, teacher. Please ask Vinod to go away from this place. What's happening here, Selvam? How do you know him? We don't have much time. Just get him out of here. Please! I don't understand a thing. Why are you calling Vinod? Why should he go? It's not important right now. I'm here to protect Vinod. Protect him from what? What's the problem? Teacher, he is in grave danger. Please save him. Take him away. What are you saying? Who's after him? Hello! Hello? Tell me! Who is more powerful? Didn't I tell that I'd find you? I've ended your menace with one shot! With just one pull shot! Do you know what's the irony? That is my freaking weakest shot! What can you do now? You're nothing but a goddamn dead phone! How did this phone come here? Do you know whose phone is this? I know! It's your student, Selvam's phone. Two weeks back, this came in as a replacement. Since then all hell broke loose. He kept calling me and drove me crazy. I roamed around streets searching for him. Only then, I found that he was dead. But he kept stalking me! Finally, only a minutes before you arrived I found that the number I was searching for belonged to this phone. When I called to this phone from your number, I found that he's been inside the phone all along. That's why I finished him with one single blow. Let me see what he can do now! Do you know what you've done? He was only trying to help you but you never realized. You may believe that. If he's good, why did he call and torture me for no reason? Don't you get it? That phone is the medium. Any dead person can talk through it. Just like a channel. If the phone is the medium, he should've talked to me on the phone! He can't call to this number. That's what I'm asking, why? Because Selvam is here. He is in your room. In my room? Why? I don't know about that. He said that someone's after you and he's protecting you. Just when he was about to tell me who it was, you broke the phone. Who could be after me? You should tell me. Who might be so mad at you that he wants you dead? But… Selvam told me something. The person knows both of us. I wonder who he is. What do we do now? We need to talk to Selvam. There's only one way to do it. We need to somehow get this phone fixed. Okay. Let's not waste time. Grab the phone and come. I'll go get the car. Come on, let's go. Today is your final session. After this, you'll be free. Until now, you might've seen this world through a little window. But now, it's time to break free and fly away from your cage. I know you're a special child. That's why, out of all others, I've come to see you. It's time. This journey will begin exactly in two minutes. Don't be scared about going alone. Just like you, there are many other patients awaiting freedom. They'll accompany you. So, it's time to say goodbye and welcome freedom. Hello! How about my neighbor, Jayakumar who died in 2007. You know him, right? Yeah but we never had a problem. Your batchmate… The girl who committed suicide last year? -Suhasini? -Yeah. Not possible. The voice is not a lady voice. Then, who else could it be? Pradeep? What am I even thinking? He's your best friend. Who else could it be? It's just me thinking about it. Come on, keep thinking. This phone needs to be repaired. -How can I repair this? -Please, sir. Give it a try. We need it urgently. Are you from any cinema company? Do you need it-- Nothing like that. Please understand -I'm expecting a call on this phone. -Why do you want to repair this phone? We have phones at throwaway prices-- Just tell us how much it would cost to repair this. Ma'am, it's shattered into pieces. I have to check what all parts are missing. It may cost at least a thousand rupees. Get it ready in half an hour, okay? Please wait. I'll see what I can do. Tell me. -Sir, have you parked your car outside? -Yes. The tow truck is here. Park it in the parking zone. -I will go and check. -Okay, sister. Sir, you can come back in a while. It will take some time. No, its okay. I'll wait here. Don't worry, sir. I'm not going to steal your phone. I wish you did. Hello! Can I speak to Shiva? Priya? -Hello, who's that? -Does it matter? Can I speak to Shiva? I'm Shiva speaking. And you? -Shiva! -Priya? Hi Shiva, how are you? -Priya, who spoke to me? -It was me. -Really? -Yes! -Was it really you? -Yes, I changed my voice while talking. Wow! You're so talented. Hello! I have found out the guy who's been driving me crazy. I know who he is! Yeah, you told me that it was Selvam. No. It's not Selvam. He's a good guy. It's Pradeep who's behind all this. I am sure! If it's Pradeep, how did you not recognize his voice? That's where the twist is. After all he's a ghost, right? -He can do anything. -So what? Are you saying that the ghosts are good at mimicry? Why would he want to hurt you? That's what even I don't understand. What did I do to him? I don't know what he is up to. I hope you realize that I'm not his psychiatrist to answer that. Correct! Dr. Indran, a psychiatrist was treating him at his home. Probably, he might have some answers. -I'll call you later. Bye. -Hello? The number you are calling is currently out of service. It's not reachable at the moment. Bro, is there an internet center nearby? -Go straight and there's one in the left. -Thanks. The 808 Sparks car that you've locked in the next street belongs to me. I was asked to come here. The officer has just gone out for tea. Wait for him. But you have the keys, right? Please unlock the car. I can't open it with this key. Money is the only key to unlock your car. Hope you understand. I'm also a government official, working for the Traffic department. Please unlock it. He'll rip me apart if I unlock it, ma'am. I didn't lock that car since it belongs to a doctor. But that creep locked that car himself. You better wait and meet him. Where is that boy? It's like giving a solution that you already have. For example it's like reading time from your watch and telling you what time it is. That's it. Very simple. For instance, you may search for the key everywhere. But finally, you might end up finding it in your own pocket. Likewise, the solution to a problem might be around us, near us or right in front of us. But many a times we ignore it. Vinod! We missed out Dr. Indran. Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Sir! In the womb of darkness Begins the dawn of the death Who ever knew? It's the spark of life that tries To awaken the distant dream Who ever knew? Here, I come For the final showdown The play will end and curtains will fall You'll lose your guise Amid an empty hall The play will end and curtains will fall You'll lose your guise Amid an empty hall Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Who ever knew? Do you think I'll go away if you break the phone? I'll rise from every single part you break. Even if you turn every part into pieces, every piece into splinters, every splinter into particles, and every particle into dust, I'll come rising from that. I know. A coward who can't even reveal his name is only worthy as particles and dust. You have been escaping until now since I don't know your real name. -This is Vinod, Pradeep's friend. -Hello. Interesting. What's wrong with his voice? But now, I know who you are. You are Dr. Indran. The one who killed all his patients in the name of treatment. You call yourself a doctor? Shame on you! What I did is not, "killing" but "social sterilization". You guys are nothing but a menace to this society. Scums that resort to anything from rape to murder and get certified as mentally ill and walk Scot-free. You think your crimes could be washed away that easily? That's why, I decided to eliminate you all from this society and visited each and everyone's house, personally. And gave them the freedom they needed. They deserved every bit of it. Who are you to decide all this? How are you entitled to do this? I'm entitled as a victim. I dedicated my whole life for guys like you. Dr. Indran is almost an idol. But what did I get in return? I lost my family, my practice, my voice and finally, my life. How are they responsible for your accident? Accident? How did you think I died? Do you remember the day you called me for an appointment? -Doctor, I need an appointment. -Text me your address. Sorry, doctor, I don't have a cellphone. Then, tell me. I'll note it down. 298… -Jayalaxmi apartments. -One minute. The signal is weak here. Can you hear me now? Go ahead! 47th street. Which street? 47th street. Yeah, go on. Anna nagar west. Chennai 101. Yeah, okay. Doctor, my house is in the interior. A little hard to locate. -Shall I-- -No. Not necessary. No matter where you are, I'll certainly come to your house. Eight o'clock. I'll be there. Yes! You only manipulated him to kill himself, right? That's why he jumped on you and died. That's the justice you deserved. What did the poor boy do to you? He was indeed a poor kid. The one that died was your friend. But the one who jumped on me-- I can't take this anymore! It was the spirit of my other patient who was within Pradeep. He was the one who shot me in the clinic and killed himself. I survived but his evil spirit remained trapped in my clinic. It's haunted. Here is the room key. That's how Selvam came to my clinic. And captured the evil spirit in a bottle. You can only control it for only one naazhigai. -It went all wrong. -What do you mean? -Die! -Selvam died. That's when the spirit escaped from the bottle and was searching for a shelter. Pradeep was invoking the spirits in your room with the book you gave. So, he possessed Pradeep. The vengeful spirit came into my life once again as Pradeep, who was already my patient. It's the same doctor we used to consult previously, from Nungambakkam. While I treated Pradeep, I didn't know that he was inside him. But the evil spirit inside him waited for the right moment and exacted revenge on me. That's how Pradeep died. Pradeep passed away this morning. But, you know what tops it all? You are the origin for all these events. It was you who gifted that book to Pradeep on his birthday. Is that why you want to kill me? Even though it seems like a good reason, there's one more thing that you'd forgotten. You were the one to get my final appointment. Eight o'clock. I'll be there. I was at your place by eight but he didn't show up. In 19 years of my career, I've never missed a single appointment. How will I miss yours? That's why I kept my appointment time and talked to you first, at eight o'clock, sharp. There's a bad news. You called to say you're behind your friend's death? Hello, who's this? Like I used my voice to control my other patients, I kept talking to you and almost brought you under my influence. But that wretched Selvam stayed in your room and kept helping you to find me in many ways. Someone spoke over the phone and said you're in some sort of a danger. I saw the number dialing with my own eyes. -That's what I want to know! -Because, Selvam is here, in your room. Wait. Why should Selvam help me? What role he's got in this? His role is deeper than you can imagine. Where did you get the book that you gifted Pradeep? The clerk hasn't turned up today. Either come tomorrow or you can find it yourself. Okay, sir. Thank you. Sir, please leave the bag and go. Sir, found the book you needed? No, sir, I didn't. Come tomorrow. I'll keep it ready for you. -What book, sir? -It is… a Leo Tolstoy's book. It's a good one. -But, its name… -Is it War and Peace? Am I that dumb? It's just a single word. Devil? Yes! That's the one. You stole one of Selvam's books from the Library and gifted it to Pradeep on his birthday. But, somehow Selvam's soul felt responsible for the consequences and stayed in your room to protect you. There were only two things that ever mattered to him. First was his house. Our house is the only thing I have in my father's memory. How come your company's board is hanging outside his gate? He somehow managed to exact revenge and reclaim it. Secondly, this phone which he managed to bring to your house. -Do you know whose phone this is? -It belongs to Selvam. -Has it been replaced? -It's an old model. Sometimes, I've even felt as if someone picked my call. I roamed around the streets searching for him. But he never expected me to take control of his phone and talk to you. Once he knew, he started opposing me But he could do nothing about it. You know why I'm telling you all this, right now? Since you've come to the right place, you have to make the right decision. Jump. You can't do anything to me. What makes you so sure? Have you gotten bold since you're out of your dungeon? Selvam isn't here to protect you. I'm already here! Hey, Selvam! Why do you keep coming in my way? Why did you get inside him, you fool! If you can come out of dust, then, why can't I get inside him? Now, listen up! Leave him and go away. Its not that simple. He's the last person in my list. My soul won't rest until I destroy him. That will not happen until I'm here. You couldn't save yourself! How will you save him? Not me. It's you who saved him. He's not the same Vinod who sought your appointment. The old Vinod died the moment he stood up against you. His life was in darkness, filled with laziness, dejection and depression. If only you hadn't shown him what fear is he wouldn't have come this far in search of light. You're talking about light? Have you ever seen it? I know nothing about light. But I know everything about darkness. Darkness is the absence of light. I was not fortunate enough to see even one speck of that in my lifetime. And it's because of you that he has started realizing things. Let this be one good deed, done by you. Go away! You think I'll take orders from you? If you try to help him, I'll destroy you as well. You're not aware of my power. Can you drop a coin in a phone dial a number and talk to someone you love? You can't! It's because now we are nothing but voices. And that too only until this phone is intact. Hey, what are you doing? Stop it! Do you know what will happen if you dismantle the phone? You'll lose your connection with this world and get lost into oblivion. It's better to be lost, than to lose your path. Do you think everything will change so easily? Wait for another half an hour. you'll see the whole city plunge into darkness. I don't think so. Hey, Selvam, don't! How many times should I keep calling the customer care? Why do you charge me every month for a phone I don't use? No need. Just remove the phone and refund my deposit amount. Jobless idiots. Pandiya! Hey, Pandiya! Who left this box here? You need to do something for me. Will you do it? It's his birthday in three days. We have ordered a cake to surprise him. Please find him, sir.
