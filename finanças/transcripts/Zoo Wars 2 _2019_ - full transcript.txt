Chubby, I trust all is in place to execute my most devious plan yet. - It is, my terrible evil leader. - Great, uh. The Zooverse animals will never know what hit them. Woo-hoo-hoo! That's it, carbon-based. You're getting the hang of it now. Feel free to open up the warp speed function once we clear this space junk. You can feel the Sparkle Express's full power at your, erm... foot tips. This is so awesome, B-52. Beats a day at the office anytime. What are you doing in space anyhow, elephant? I thought you had an office job to go back to. I do, but I asked for a two-week paid vacation on the account of I saved the universe. They couldn't say no. Too bad I got to be back at the office tomorrow. I wish this time in space never ended. Every day is a new mission. This is so cool! Remember when a Hamster Planet needed a chew stick? We took care of that pronto. The giraffes were all tangled up in one big neck-knot. - Solved that in a snip. - I'm having a blast. Thanks for the free flying lessons too. Who said anything about free, carbon-based? I expect something in return for the valuable professional training I'm providing you. Oh, er... well, I mean, I don't have much. I live pretty modestly. In my own dimension, that is. What do I owe? Well, I could use a case of synthetic printer lubricants from your office, if you must know. Printer oil? You want me to, uh, steal printer oil from my office? No. Not steal. You shall borrow some oil, Nuke. You can replace what you've borrowed at later time and they promote you to, uh, Chief Office Manager or whatever you space animals aspire to these days. Uh, um... Okay. So, I'll get you the oil. - Do you have a copy machine on board? - Copy machine? Don't be silly, elephant. Whatever would I do with a copy machine out here in space? No, carbon-based, it's for my personal mechanics. Peps my performance and keeps my system running like a dream. Oh, er, well, yeah. Sure. Oh, I'll get you the whole case then. I wouldn't want the best motherboard in the universe to get, erm, he-he, rusty. Excellent. Say, I can't help but notice you're still flying the Express. When are you gonna return Princess Sparklefeather's personal fleet vessel? Never. The Princess gave me the keys to this baby. It's now the B-52 Express for all intents and purposes. Cool bananas. Ha-ha. Ah, how is the Princess these days? Aah! Fabulous. Loving her honeymoon at the Twin Island Planets. Simply divine. Swimming and playing fuzzball all the day. The dream. Fuzzball? Oh, wow. "teach your big ears how to fuzzball, molecular form, and watch up ahead. It appears as though we're about to encounter a meteor storm. With the Nebula Two wormhole rather close on our left, and Nebula Three on our right. Your navigational field should be vertical. Er, what happens if we slip into one of those wormholes? It's likely we'll be thrust into another dimension. Oh, I see. So, we can just find a wormhole back then, right? It's possible. The statistical probability of discovering a return wormhole, once a Carbon has successfully migrated dimensions is exactly 4.324675859 percent out of 100. So, not terribly likely. Oh! Erm... Ah... Maybe you should take over ship controls for this part. I think that's a smashing idea, carbon-based. Whoa! Watch out! Hold on tight to your floppy ears, Carbon, it's about to get rough. Argh! I think I'm gonna be sick. Try to control yourself for space sake. You're in the hands of a tightly calibrated machine here. Ooh, that was close. How about two cases of printer oil, B-52? Ha-ha. You've earned it. Oh, carbon-based, you know how to flatter an old machine like me. I'd cry if I had tear ducts. Unfortunately, I do not, but I'm thinking of getting a pair as soon as I return to my home planet. I think two tear ducts is all I need to feel like a real organically viable life form. What do you say, Carbon? Could you imagine me with tear ducts? I bet you could never tell I was a synthetic organism if I started pouring buckets of tears right now. You'll be like, "Oh, that's a real living thing." You would too, OMG, he-he. Yes. Sure, he-he. Tear ducts are all their age these days. Hello again my Siders. I hope this transmission finds you oh, so unwell. Long time no see, Boo Boo. You sure know when to drop in, don't you? Oh, it's a gift I've got. I'm just excellent at this stuff. Dropping in, dropping out, scaring folks, you know, evil leader stuff, he-he. Whoa! Meteor hit! Meteor hit! Boo Boo, if you'll excuse us, you caught us at a really bad time right now. I do mind actually. I was just calling to tell you... Over and out, Boo Boo. - You dumped Boo Boo's call? - I did, indeed. - He's gonna be mad! - Oh, let him. Letting out some steam will do that rodent form some good. What do you think he wanted, B? I imagine he wants what he always wants, chaos, mayhem, and destruction. It's just a matter how he's going to go about getting it. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Oh, dear. I just can't deal with any more chips and dents on my face from all the emotional roller-coaster of dealing with space villains. I... I don't understand. I was calling those cheese-brains to give them my evil gloat speech. What just happened? Chubby, check our connections. If those 3D transmitters are on the fritz again, we are taking this ship right back to Ships-R-us for a full refund. I've had it with lousy customer service. I've had it! We used to be able to get what we wanted by instilling fear and dread in every being we encountered. Not anymore. This ease-and-lab-garbage has ruined the universe. Anyone thinks they can get away with anything. Um, it appears as though the Sparkle Express terminated our connection, Boo Boo. Excuse me? They... they hung up on me? - It appears so, yes. - Ugh! Feta, feta, feta, feta! They will pay for this. They've no idea what's in store for them. I hope everyone enjoys this. Let's all join hands and sing kumbaya together. A moment of truce between the Nice Side and the Mice Side while they can. This Zooverse hasn't seen the last of Boo Boo Squeal. Phew! That was close. Indeed. Well, nice flying B-52. It is what I'm programmed to do, carbon-based. Now that the perils are behind us, I'll drop you off back at your planet Zootrini. And remember you mustn't tell anyone of our missions. Lest you wish to see them greatly endangered. My trunk is sealed, B. Hey, you're back. I... I thought you quit. Huh? Er, oh, hey, Marty. No, just took some time off. Trust me, I thought of quitting, but I guess I'm too soft in the gut. Oh, darn! Yeah, there was all the gossip around here that you had jumped ship. That you were off fighting the bad guys, never to return. Oh. Uh, not quite. Ha-ha. Well, maybe a little. Nuke, uh, I want you to know while you were gone, you became our symbol of freedom for all the animals, especially the ones stuck in this office. I got your picture hanging up in my cubicle and everything, want to see? Oh, that's okay. I believe you. Unfortunately, I'm back at being just another one of the office animals. I don't deserve a picture on anybody's desk. Yeah. Well, to me, you do. Welcome back, Nuke. Thanks. What's been going on at the watering hole? - Eeh... You haven't missed much. - I didn't think I would. Hey, the boss dumped a bunch of your workload on me. Sorry about that, pal. Nah, no worries. You know I have mad computer skills. I can cluster compute to a super computer performance with my eyes closed. Ha-ha. Crazy. But, uh, now that you're back, mind if I forward it to you? Sure, go ahead. Awesome. Thanks, pal. You're a true hero. What do you think? Could you get this done by Tuesday? - Next Tuesday? - Uh, nope. - Tuesday tomorrow. - Argh. - Chubby, get Kitty Clank on the monitor, will you? - Right away, boss. Ahh. Boo Boo, I've heard much about you. It's a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance. I'm certain we can do some galactic damage together. That's the idea, Kitty Clank. Ah-huh. From the moment I hatched my plan to renege on the Nice Side's peace treaty and plunge the Zooverse back into war, I thought of you. Ha-ha-ha. I'm flattered, buffed and lubricated by your words, Boo Boo Squeal. And a robot of your reputation deserves a prominent position in any galaxy's war, so I'd like to offer you my right hand. What? Uh, no, don't be giving your hand away, Boo Boo. You need both your hands or paws. Uhm... No, they're hands. They look like teeny tiny hands with cute little nails and tiny pink padding. Ha-ha. They're so cute. - Chubby. - Don't give one of them away, Boo Boo. It would be incredibly inconvenient without one hand. You won't be able to rub them together when you do something evil and, and you... Will you pipe down, Chubby? I'm speaking figuratively. A seat at my right hand, you moron. A seat. - Oh. - Anyway... as I was saying, I'd like to offer you a seat at my right hand, Kitty Clank. It's an honor to be asked, Boo Boo. I'll join your army because I believe in your cause, war. I hate peace as much as you do, if not more. Oh, my last evil escapade failed. I was turned into a cuddly little robot kitten. I tasted peace and cuteness firsthand, and I was horrified. - The abomination. - Indeed. Do you have any idea how much sweet talking I endured? How many fluffy bows I wore around my neck? How many balls of yarn I had to play with? I'm sick just thinking about it. Ew. Sounds like a nightmare. Total nightmare. Thankfully, I was able to escape. If there's anything I can do to help bring war back to the Zooverse, I'm all in. Sweet mascarpone! Welcome to the fold, Kitty Clank. You will receive your first wicked instructions shortly. Over and out. Chubby, locate the space crust of Ta-Ta the Third for me. He usually loiters around Nebula Two. Right away, Boo Boo. You're so cute when you're overcome with revenge. Eeh, what was that? I... I mean, oh, you're terrifying when you're angry. Ah! That's better. I've been this way since I was a wee mouse. My schoolmates lived in abject terror. All I needed to say was, "cheese!" uh-hee-hee, and they shuddered in fear. I'll bet they did. I'm nothing like that Kitty Clank though. Did you get a load of that guy? Crazy as a mad hatter in a hailstorm that one. Totally unhinged I tell you. - I'm still here. - What? Oh, eh, oh... I will be in touch soon, Kitty Clank. Uh, until then, carry on the good work. Chubby, how long have you worked for me? Uh, as far back as I can remember, Boo Boo. Every day, 12 hours a day for 7,000 ion years. Yup. It sounds about right. And, you know, it would be nice to think you knew how to do your job by now, wouldn't it? Is that a rhetorical question, Boo Boo? No, Chubby. It's an actual question. Ugh. Argh. I don't know how I endure. I really don't. Start our ship's coordinates, Chubby, at once. Right away, Boo Boo. I think I'm gonna have to find a couple of toothpicks soon, Marty. Toothpicks? Whatever for, Nuke? You got something stuck between your tusks? No, I just need something to keep my eyelids open. Have you ever tried chicory root, Nuke? It's the best. That thing will wake you up in a snap. Nah. Chicory root gives me the jitters. Eh, you are a sensitive package there, Nuke. - Can't imagine how you saved the universe. - Sometimes I can't either. - Wake up, Nuke. - Ah, uh, What? What? I didn't say anything. - Oh. Uh... - It's me, Bongo Bananas. What? What are you doing here? I work here, buddy, remember? I think all that adventuring went to his head. That poor elephant has gone and lost it. - I've come to warn you, Nuke. - Warn me? Yes, of a great disturbance in the Sauce. - No! - Hey, uh, are you okay over there? Maybe you need to take a little more time off. It's Boo Boo Squeal. - Boo Boo? - Yes, Boo Boo. He's assembling an army. He's planning to break the Zooverse peace treaty and attack. So, that's why he called. What? Has he contacted you? Yeah, earlier today, but we sort of, er, hung up on him. Dude, hung up on Boo Boo Squeal? You know how B-52 is. He's got a bit of a temper. Ha-ha. I know, I know, Nuke, my friend. Synthetic organisms are always hamming it up just to make sure we remember they have feelings too. Do they ever. What about Boo Boo Squeal, Bongo? I fear Boo Boo is almost ready, Nuke, dude. Ready? But, Bongo Bananas, he doesn't have the Sauce. - How dangerous can he be? - Hey, bud, if you need a banana break, go ahead. I'll cover for you. More dangerous than you realize, Nuke my friend. He's building an army of some of the baddest baddies the galaxy's ever known and he's planning on regaining the power of the Sauce. - What can we do? - Why don't you take the rest of the day off, Nuke? I'll punch out for you. You need to call on your robot buddy, Bon Jovi, stat. - You mean B-52? - B-52, Depeche Mode, who cares, Nuke, dude? He has a space vehicle. You need to get to it right away. - But he just dropped me off. - Want me to call a space cab? We need you out there, Nuke, saving the Zooverse. Get on the Sparkle Express and on that mission right away my elephant friend. - Should I go now? - Yes. Yes. Tiptoes, I can hear you clear down the hall. Did you come back to work or to socialize? Oh, sorry, boss. Eh. Working away here. Typedy type, type, type, type, titype, type, titype. It's great to be back with you, guys. It really is. Oh, how I missed it. There's no time for watering hole chat, Nuke. Boo Boo Squeal must be stopped. The Zooverse depends on it. - But what can I do? - Are you asking for more work, Tiptoes? You want the Zooverse to survive, don't you my friend, Nuke? - Well, yes. - Well, all you had to do was ask, Tiptoes. I'm sending files to your desk now. I need them completed by day's end. Nuke, you got to cool down. You're gonna overwork yourself. You don't want Boo Boo to reduce this Zooverse to rubble, do you, my elephant friend? - No. - Excuse me? Nuke, it's now or never. The Nice Side needs you. - What do I do? - Are you paying attention, Tiptoes? Complete the files and send them to me when you're done. Do I speak Zirconian? Just hit enter. Good luck, Nuke Bongo, Bongo are you still there? B-52, long time no see. Exactly one, one trillionth of a plutonium ion by my calculations, carbon-based. In other words, not very long at all. Ha! I never thought I'd be so happy to see a robot who doesn't understand humor. More like a robot that has no time for anything but factual information. Humor is for elephants who perform circus tricks for peanuts. Hm-mm. Speaking of, you got any? - I haven't had lunch yet. - Negative. The Sparkle Express has no need for organic food supplies. Even if the co-pilot is carbon-based? Especially if the co-pilot is carbon-based. I've observed you elephants eating. Are you aware of what can happen if peanut shells jam the master controls? Not to mention the gas. Oh, the gas. It's, it's just, just horrible. Uh, well, uh, us elephants are foragers, you know? Lots of digestion taking place in the lower intestines. Flatulence could be a side effect of a greasy diet. Er, uh, avocados, for example, really do a number on my... Carbon, last thing I intend to hear is about your gas issues. Take some antacid or something and put it to rest. The B-52 Express is no place for flatulence. Now, what are you doing back there, prey? Boo Boo Squeal is planning to violate our truce and re-start war with the Zooverse. Well, congratulations, Captain Obvious. - Well... What? You know about it? - Of course I know about it. You didn't trust Boo Boo Squeal to actually honor that peace treaty, did you? Well, uh, oh... I mean, he, he said he'd... Villains always say, carbon-based. It was only a matter of time before he reneged. I'm just pleasantly surprised peace lasted as long as it did. We should contact Boo Boo Squeal and see what he wanted to tell us earlier. Shouldn't have hung up on him, you know? Rats can hold a grudge, especially evil ones. Hopefully it won't cause the end of the Zooverse. Ha! He'll get over it. Let's get him on the telly. Boo Boo, the Sparkle Express is calling. Let them. If they think they can hang up on Boo Boo and then call back, they're sorely mistaken. Connect us to Ta-Ta the Third instead. At least he has some manners. Right away, Boo Boo. Greetings, Ta-Ta. I see you are ready to join forces with me again. We've done great evil things in the past and we shall again in the future. What you say? I say I'm ready to join forces with the evilest space monster the Universe has ever known. Hm, I think I prefer powerfullest over evilest. What do you think, Chubby? Hm, powerfullest encompasses more traits, I think. Like, uh, evilest is just the evilest and then that's it. Right. Evilest is just bad, whereas powerfullest is a limitless characteristic. I'd go with powerfullest if I had to pick. It sounds more epic. Me too. Powerfullest it is. Uh, if I could chime in here as someone who's also been called both powerfullest and evilest, I find that the evilest reputation has a certain ring to it that powerfullest just doesn't have. Oh, really? What do you like about it? Well, if you're the powerfullest it's like, you know, "Eh, maybe he's a nice guy who happens to be the most powerfullest too." Whereas if you're known as evilest they tend to stay way out of your way a bit more. It does a lot of the work for you. There's no mistaking evilest, you know? I see. So, it's easier to pillage and conquer. - Pretty much. - Great. Oh. Ah. In that case, the rumors are true, I am definitely the evilest mouse in the Zooverse, - and I come to you with a proposition. - Oh, yeah? Ta-Ta, how would you like to join a coalition of evil? The likes of which the Zooverse has never seen. You had me at evil. Ha-ha. Yeah, tell me more. This era of peace has gone on long enough. The Zooverse is full of fantastic villains and we've all been diminished by playing, uh, nicey-nice. I heard that. Did you know that Ranger The Forked Tongue reads children stories at the library on Planet Bubbles? Argh! No! It's true. I saw him meself. What was Ta-Ta the Third doing at a library on Bubbles? I work a janitorial shift in there on Sundays. Ew. Ah, alright. That proves my point. I say, "No more." We want to break the truce. Attack the Nice Side and reclaim the Sauce for ourselves. - Yeah. - Sounds good. I'm in. Excellent. I'll also have you know, I'm looking for a deputy commander in this outfit, and I think you'd fit the bill nicely. - Does it pay? - How's all the Sauce you can pour on your spaghetti sound? Eh, deal! Wonderful. I have a couple more stops to make to fill out our team. If everything comes together, we'll attack at once. We'll be in touch, Ta-Ta. Eh, eh, Chubby, find me the ship of Coot-Coot of Planet Warzack. - I must speak with him next. - Aye, aye, captain. And no pirate voice, Chubby. It's just weird. Oh, right. Right away, Boo Boo. Speaking of weird, did you get a load of Ta-Ta? Did he put on weight or what? Ha-ha. More like Fat-Fat the Third. You forgot to sign off there, Boo Boo. Oh, oh, yes, of course. Over and out and talk soon, Fa... I mean, Fat Fa... I mean, Ta-Ta. Chubby! Sorry. Boo Boo? Come in, Boo Boo. It's Nuke with the Sparkle Express. Come in. Argh. He's not answering. I told you he'd be mad. Mice. So sensitive. B-52, I feel like we're in over our heads here. Bongo Bananas came to me at work and told me of Boo Boo's plans. Sounds like a zoo war is about to break again. What can we do? There's only one thing to do at a time like this, carbon. - What is it? Tell me. - Oil your joints and get your motherboard tuned. Oil my... oh, come on. I'm an elephant. You can oil your joints and get tuned, but what can I do? I suppose you can try balancing on your front legs, like they do in the circus. Some call it yoga I believe. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Say, why don't we call Princess Sparklefeather? She's the leader of the Nice Side. Surely she'll know how to handle this. I told you. She's honeymooning at the Twin Island Planets for the next fractal ion. And then there's no telecommunication reception I'm afraid. Goodness knows she's earned the rest. Well, don't you think she'd want to know that Boo Boo Squeal is amassing an army to violate the peace treaty and get his little mouse hands on the Sauce again? Ooh, that would probably be of interest, yes. But, as I said, she's unreachable at the moment. Then why don't we go get her? And interrupt her honeymoon? Heavens, no. You don't make sense sometimes, you know that? I don't make sense? I'm a robot. All I do is make sense. I'm built to be factual. And yet you're making an emotional decision to not interrupt the Princess's honeymoon. Hm, I suppose you have a point there, carbon-based. I have to schedule a tune up and get those tear ducts implants while I'm at it. Aah. We're doomed. I've located Coot-Coot's ship, Boo Boo. He's right up ahead, circling Nebula 2, just like you said. Well, what are you waiting for? Patch me through. Hey. Do you... do you think I should go by Chub-Chub instead? Why would you do that? You've always been Chubby. Well, he-he, all you guys have two names, all but me. And, uh... that should tell you something. - Connect us to Coot-Coot. - Oh, uh, okay. Who goes there? Greetings, Coot-Coot. It's been a while. Ho-ho. Fancy meeting you here, Boo Boo Squeal. I thought I'd seen the last of you after the battle of the Planet Bubbles. Alas, that was only the beginning of the Mice side takeover. We've since grown strong with the Sauce, Coot-Coot. You possess the Sauce? Well, no, not currently, it's been stripped from me by the Nice Side, but I'm working on regaining my powers. - Oh. - Working hard? - Very hard. - Yeah, almost there. Which brings me to the point of my visit. Ha-ha. I, I'm assembling a team of Galactic villains unlike anything the Zooverse has ever seen. Separately we are fearsome, but together we're unstoppable. And what are you gonna do with this team? We are going to curdle cheese and tell funny stories about past wars. What do you think? We're going to regain the Sauce, violate that lousy peace treaty and propel the Zooverse back into war. - Are you with us? - Oh! That sounds awesome. I'm in. Marvelous! Aah. I have one more stop to make, then I'll be in touch with directives, the gist of which is to destroy the Nice Side. I can't wait. That's the attitude. Er, Chubby? End this transmission. There, that wasn't so difficult, was it? Uuh, n... no? How about that goofy creature, Coot-Coot, huh? Ha-ha. Brains the size of a Swiss cheese hole. Boo Boo, I'm still here. - Eh! You what? - Yeah, yeah. You turned off visual, but the audio is still live. Chubby! B-52, I'd just feel a lot better if we had somebody else on board. You know, to get our backs in case we're in trouble. We need our very own Nice Side Hero team. Excuse me, what would they do to our backs? Never mind, it's just a figure of speech. Ah, you carbons are known for your tenuous grasp on your own language. Hey, I have an idea. My buddy who works with me would never let us down. He's a computer whiz. I'm going to call him. Oh, dear. Kingdoms have fallen on the backs of buddies. Marty, hey there. Hey, big guy. How's it going? Uh, in a bit of a situation here. You disappeared again. You back being a space hero? Uh, trying to be. Say, did you... did the boss dump all my work on you again? Ha. He buried me up to my eyeballs. Oh, that's okay though. I can handle it. I'm mostly eyeballs. Don't worry. I'll take it all off your hands when I come back, Marty. Oh! Er, they didn't call you? - No. About what? - Er... The boss, uh, terminated you, Nuke. They're letting you go. They don't want a space hero who keeps taking time off. Space heroes are cool and everything, but don't get their work done, you know? I hope this space hero thing works out for you, carbon, or you'll have to go to the Space Unemployment office to get your peanuts. Oh, boy. I hope so too. Say, Marty, I need a favor. No need to ask, big guy. You can put me down as a reference anytime. - Thanks, Marty, but that's not what I'm talking about. - It's not? No, I'm here with my pal B-52 of the Nice Side robotic fleet. Oh. Ah! Well, excuse me. Moving up in the Zooverse already, I see. Uh, yeah, space hero stuff. You know how it is. Yeah, argh. Wish I did. Marty, the Mice Side is at it again. They are planning to break the Zooverse truce and start an all-out war. Oh. Get out! I wish I could, but we have to fight. - There's no time to spare. - What's all this have to do with me? He's about to ask you to agree to perilous activities far beyond your skill or understanding, carbon-based. Ah, okay. Oh. Uh, kinda. Marty, the Nice Side currently has no leader. Princess Sparklefeather is on her honeymoon and can't be reached. - I know this is inconvenient, but... - That's putting it mildly. But would you join us to try and put a stop to this craziness? - It's going to take time from work, isn't it? - Probably. Uh, maybe I should just call in sick, then. - Might not be a bad idea. - Okay, I'm in. Yeah? Thanks, Marty! I knew we could count on you. Hey, since it is dangerous and all, how about we pick a new name for me? A new name? What do you mean? Well, Marty doesn't really have a ring to it, you know? How about Zortec? Zortec? Hmm... I don't know. Or Eyeballs McSane? Uh, I'm kind of used to calling you Marty. - I don't know if I can stop now. It might take some practice. - Slim Green Star? - Ooh! That's very heroic. - You like it? Indeed. Why don't we think about it, Marty? - Slim, hey, try it out. - Okay, Slim. Nice. Ha-ha. Slim Green Star reporting for duty. - Where do we start? - Right at the top. I need you to use your supercomputer skills to intercept the leader of the Mice Side, Boo Boo Squeal. We need to know what he's up to. Woah. I'm on it. Oh, it's you. I'm still waiting on those three gnats you promised me for the last mission. They are coming, Chewflies, they're coming. I'd like to know when. Soon. I got my bookkeeper on it as we speak. In the meantime, I have a proposition for you. I always seem to get the soggy end of the lily pad with your propositions, Boo Boo. Well, not this time. I want you to join us in violating that ridiculous truce and declaring a new war on the Zooverse. Will I finally get my gnats? You can have all the gnats you want Chewflies, eh? Endless gnats. Endless gnats? Ooh-hoo. You speak of dreams, Boo Boo. Ha-ha. Okay, I'm in. Splendid, and now with my fearsome new army by my side, ha-ha, Chewflies, Coot-Coot, Ta-Ta and Kitty Clank, the Mice Side will rise again and the Zooverses won't know what hit them. Ah? Chubby, get me coordinates for the Sparkle Express. Ha-ha. It's time to settle an old score. I feel a lot better with Marty on our side, B-52. He may have never fought a space battle, but there's strength in numbers. You mean Slim Green Star? You know, carbon-based, sometimes the power of the mind is greater than you think. - What do you mean? - I mean, sometimes all it takes for an ordinary carbon to rise to extraordinary achievements is the belief in oneself. If Marty doesn't inspire one to be all they can be, perhaps Slim does. And therein lies a hero. Wow, I, I never thought of it like that. Well, your brain synapses are extremely limited. Huh? Oh, hey, I have another friend I want you to meet. We worked the circus together on planet Nordoozy. You were in a circus? Yeah, that was before my cubicle job crushed my showbiz dreams. - That's where I met Rudy. - Oh, fine. Let's meet this circus act, alright? Can't wait. Shh. I'm gonna call him. I bet he'd love to help us. Check's in the mail. Rudy, it's me, Nuke Tiptoes. Nuke? I didn't recognize. You've gotten big, pachyderm. Your ears are huge. Uh, thanks. Er, I think. Yeah, I haven't seen you since we left the circus. What you been up to? Oh, you know, same old same old. I held down an office job till today. Ha-ha. Learned to fly a starship, saved the Zooverse. Ha-ha. You're still funny, Nuke. Maybe I should have been a comedian. It'd be safer, that's for sure. Listen, Rudy. I'll make this short and sweet. How would you like to join me on the Nice Side and help defend the Zooverse against an impending Mice Side attack? An attack? But it's peacetime. And peace is about to end unless we defend it. Oh, sounds exciting. Sign him up, he's too dim to fear anything. What do you say, old pal? Are you with us? Sure, what do we defend first? Perhaps, um, us. Not to alarm you, carbon-based, but it appears as though we got visitors. It's Coot-Coot! Nice to see you, Nice Siders. I think it's time for your demise. - Whoa! - You okay, Nuke? What's going on? Are you still there? We're hit. Argh. Are we gonna die? Negative, elephant, the damage is strictly cosmetic. Activating Deep Space lasers. Hang on, as you carbons say. Those lasers are strong, B-52. Can we withstand this attack? No ones' ship's weaponry can disable the B-52 Express. We're hit. We're hit. Tell me where you are, Nuke, I'm coming. I'll be there like the old days at the circus. Remember the song? ♪ I'll be there, my friend ♪ ♪ By your side ♪ ♪ I'll be there too ♪ Eh, eh. ♪ Let's take a ride ♪ ♪ To the canteen I'll be with you ♪ Ah-ha-ha. ♪ No matter what I'll be there too ♪ Prepare for war Nice Siders. Rudy, Rudy? We lost your circus pal, carbon. You're singing on your own now. Oh, geez! ♪ In hardship and in glee I'll be there ♪ ♪ I'll be there, My friend, you'll see ♪ Take that, nicey-nice. And that, and that, and that! Whoa, that's heavy artillery. How many warships are out there? - Standby, carbon-based. My instruments read four. - Four?! Whoa! Stop the universe, I want to get off. Kiss you're little behinds goodbye, peace-nicks. The Mice Side rules the Zooverse. Fire! We, we have to do something, B-52. Uh, can we get out of here? Attempting, carbon-based. Attempting. Incredible, that tin can you call a ship is still in one piece? Well, hello, B-52, fancy seeing you here. Kitty Clank, you cat. I should have known you were involved. - You know him? - Once upon a time, we were constructed in the same factory. Albeit me, from top of the line components and from him scraps. Uh-huh, there's an after-hours joke by bored technicians. They inserted a motherboard into the abominable creation and it got away from them, became self-aware. Took on a life of its own. Now, it's obviously aligned with the Mice Side. Mice Side? But he's a cat type thingy. Evil aligns itself with evil, carbon-based. Mouse, cat, no matter. We're the enemy in their equation. Prepare to be blasted to smithereens. We're doomed. Never fear, carbon, B-52 is here. - Oh, yeah? - Indeed. I've had just about enough of this craziness. Engage turbo thrusters. Hold on tight to your little goofy tail, carbon. We're out of here. Ta-Ta, tell me, have you destroyed the Sparkle Express, that pesky elephant and that annoying robot, my most despised foes? We, uh, almost destroyed it, Boo Boo. What do you mean, almost? You either did or you didn't. We attacked savagely and did loads of damage, I can assure you. - But? - But, uh, they were able to warp speed and they got away. They didn't... they... they got away? Argh! I assembled the greatest team of vicious villains ever put together and they can't overtake a ship named the Sparkle Express? Oh, when it's four on one? We'll get them next time, Boo Boo. Next time? Argh! The proud space warrior Ta-Ta the Third, son of Ta-Ta the Second and grandson of First Ta-Ta, will get them next time? Argh! You know what? You are fired! That's not the attitude of a deputy commander. - What about the Sauce you promised me? - What about it? If we can't even down a bucket of bolts like the Sparkle Express, how can we expect to regain the full power of the Sauce? We'll find the Sauce, Boo Boo. Uhm, it's too late for promises. You are fired, Ta-Ta. Go get an office job or something, will you? You're not cut out for this. Ooh. Chubby! Yes, Boo Boo? Fire him. Yes, Boo Boo. But... but, Boo Boo! Wait a minute, eh, uh, this looks familiar. - Are we in the... - The Sauce Dimension. - But how... how did we... - Our systems went into overdrive during the laser battle, so when I hit warp speed it doubled down on our trajectory. My calculations tell me we were propelled through a rip in the space-time fabric, and were therefore able to cross dimensions. - Whoa, that's gnarly. - Indeed. What do we do now? Those Mice Side ships are gonna be looking for us. In all probability, yes. You'll need to lay low for a while as you carbon-bases say, assess the damage to the Sparkle Express and utilize Sauce power to reboot our systems. If Boo Boo Squeal is able to tap into the Sauce power again there may be no stopping him. That's the risk we face, carbon-based. Enough Sauce exists to flood an entire dimension. If one were to perform a simple tweak, like adding jalapeno, it could be catastrophic to the Zooverse. Ah, well, I'm worried, B-52. Worry is not an emotion that computes in my data-banks, but I share your sentiment of great concern. - So, you're worried? - If you prefer. Congratulations on your promotion to Deputy Commander, Chewflies. I should have offered you the position from the outset. Yeah, you should've. But hey, live, learn. Ha-ha. We won't slip up again, I can assure you of that, Boo Boo. I don't expect you to, and I'd like to add to our ranks. Ha-ha. I thought I'd assembled the ideal team, but now I'm not so sure. I need one more member. Oh, oh, yeah? - Someone cunning. - Yes? - Someone ruthless. - Whoa. Someone so absolutely, undeniably, incredibly evil that the entire Zooverse will quake in fear at the mere sight of them. - I'm ready, Boo Boo. - Hey, I think I know someone who fits the bill. He-he. I'll call on Postal. - Postal? Oh. - Postal? Uh, he lives on one of those bio diverse planets in the Cumulon Galaxy. It's a real throwback. Has an atmosphere, ice glaciers, mountain vistas, rolling meadows. He-he. You know, the whole nine yards. Hu-ha, sounds like it's bigger than nine yards to me. We might never find him. We should pick someone closer. Hush, Chubby. I'm intrigued. Can you get me in touch with this Postal character? Sure, I got his number around here somewhere. I... I... I'll have him call you. Excellent. Mark my words. Once my army is at full strength there will be no stopping us. That's right. - Oh, stop. - What? Uh, just stop. You're a pachyderm. It, it, it's silly when you do it. Sorry, Boo Boo. Em, Chubby? That heel Ta-Ta the Third, said that the Sparkle Express used warp speed to escape our attack. But they aren't on our radar screens. So, where did they go? Uh, far away I guess. It would have to be extraordinarily far away to evade our Goudas radar, unless... Unless it was another dimension entirely, like the Sauce Dimension. Oh! Wow, you think? Chubby, prepare warp speed. No coordinates. No coordinates? But, Boo Boo, we'd... We could implode. So could the Sparkle Express, he-he, but they didn't. And you can't tell me they had time to enter coordinates under intense laser fire from all sides. No, they just roll the cheese cubes and took their chances. I think they landed right in the Sauce Dimension, uh, uh, and so will we. The Sauce Dimension calls all form into itself. We'll get there. I... I'm sure of it. You know, it's actually kind of relaxing out here, B-52. Ah, yes. The Sauce Dimension contains a unique aroma that can lower carbon-based blood pressure, as well as cholesterol and put one at ease. And in my case, it's like instant component lube. It's, like, really chill. I could get used to this. To be at one with the Sauce is to inhabit this relaxed space all the time. You need only imagine it and it's there for you. Umm, maybe one day when I can just let go and be. You know, when the Mice Side isn't gearing up for war with us. They won't find us here, carbon-based. It's a very precise wrinkle in the space-time continuum that leads to the Sauce Dimension. And the odds of Boo Boo Squeal finding it are 4 trillion, 376 million, 802 thousand, 473... Hello there, cheese brains. ...uh, one. So much for odds. We meet again, Nice Siders. Now, if you don't mind, ha-ha, pass the Sauce. Boo Boo, allow me to remind you that attacking us in the Sauce Dimension is an astoundingly bad idea. And why is that, rust bucket? Or are you bluffing? Your poker face is lousy, whereas I won the Milky Way Millennial Cheese Tournament back to back. The Milky Way Millennial Cheese Tournament? Wait, how old are you? None of your business, elephant. Never ask a mouse his age. You may have escaped my cohorts, but you won't escape me. Now, prepare yourselves to feel the Mice Side's wrath. Very well, Boo Boo. You've got us right where you want us. - Fire at will. - Wait. Do... do... what? So long, losers. Chubby, open fire. Activating lasers, Boo Boo. - What just happened? - They fired their lasers and were thrown back from whence they came. There is no aggression in the Sauce Dimension. Wow. You mean we're totally safe here too? The Sauce Dimension is a pot of tranquility in the chaotic Zooverse. All beings who enter it can bask in its stillness, while all violator's actions are reversed on those perpetrators. I feel like we should be seated on the floor in one of those yoga poses you were talking about. Well, you were circus-trained. I imagine it's no problem for you. I didn't do the seat routines. I, I was more of a dancer. Oh, my. You learn something new every day. What the... Where are... Where did they go? And where's the Sauce? Uh, it looks like we're not in the Sauce Dimension anymore, Boo Boo. I can see that, you big log. Why not? I had those rubes right where I wanted them. - You wanna try warp speed again? - No. No, no, let them sweat. They know they can only run for so long. And wherever they go, sooner or later, we'll find them. Enough. Hello, is this thing on? Chubby, where is this transmission coming from? Uh, hmm, looks like the Cumulum Galaxy, Boo Boo. It must be Chewflies' friend. You, you know, Postal. Dang the technology. Hello, can anyone hear me? Oh, we hear you loud and clear, Postal. Hey. Hey, how did you know my name? I did not hear you say my name yet. We're supposed to recruit this nitwit? What's Zooverse coming to? The Mice Side is all-seeing and all-knowing, Postal. - We've been anticipating your call. - That's crazy. He-he. So, how many would you like? - What? - Cookies. How many would you like to order? Is this just for you, or for your whole crew? Wait, er, what, what are you talking about? What's this cookie business? Is this code for something? I only use a promo code at Christmas time. Uh, do you celebrate Christmas out there? We do here on my planet. I think we're talking about two different things here, Postal. I'm recruiting soldiers to join the Mice Side and wage war against the Zooverse. Oh, ho-ho, I'm smelling homemade cookies. Oh, do you have oatmeal raisin? Shut up, Chubby! Listen, Postal. I don't have time to mess around. War is coming. And it's coming soon. The Mice Side will conquer the Zooverse once and for all. And when that's achieved, we'll move on to other galaxies like Cumulon. If you're smart, you'll join us now. Oh, you mean like a, like a, a, uh, uh... corporate merger? Can I keep my cookie copyright? It's kind of my thing. Uh, it's my granny's recipe, you see? It's all in the paprika. I don't believe this. Am I being unclear? Maybe he's just one-track minded? Or maybe he's unfit to join the Mice Side. Postal, I'll explain myself once more with as many single syllable words as I can use. We're looking for a bad guy to join our bad guy army and do bad things to good guys. Oh! I see. I thought you were a new cookie customer. Feta me. Uh, I'm kinda laid back, you know. I don't think I'd be real good in war time. Maybe in the kitchen patrol. Yeah. Uh, I see that. This whole thing's just a big mistake. I'll tell you what, do you know any vicious types who'd be a good fit for what we're doing? Someone who looks like you, but, uh, isn't so... uh, soft? Hmm, let me think. Oh, I've got it. I know just who you're looking for. Wonderful. Tell me. You need to talk to Badgum and the Beep, they're the most savage creatures you'll ever meet. Sounds good. Where can I find these Badgum and Beep people? Oh, they're up at North in the planet Bobo's glacial tundra. Be careful though. It's not for the weak up there. Hard terrain. I like it. Steel sharpen, steel. Uh, say, Postal, what's with the name if you don't mind me asking? Oh, that's on account of our mail order business. Granny's cookies, yum-yum. He-he. You should check it out sometime. Oh, oh, boy. He-he. Yeah, I, I'll, I'll do that sure. Chubby, get us out of here and chart us to planet Bob-Bobo immediately. We'll orbit the Northern hemisphere and locate these monsters at once. Right away, Boo Boo. Uh, oh. Before we sign off, do you think I can place an order for some granny yum-yum oatmeal raisin cookies? Mh-hmm, yeah. Uh, uh, go ahead. Oh, do, do you have any macadamia nut also? Aah. Uh, this feels amazing. I never wanna leave. I'm so at peace with this time in the Sauce Dimension, B-52. Well, you can begin ratcheting the tension back up to an unbearable degree, carbon-based. Since we've got to head back into the deep space and open ourselves to attack from any number of Mice Side agents who will be aiming for us, bent on our destruction. Thanks, that really puts things in perspective. - Don't mention it. - B-52, I have an idea. Now, hear me out. I know she's out of range of our technology, but maybe we could contact Princess Sparklefeather using Sauce power? That is an interesting proposition, carbon-based, and not hopelessly out of the question, like some of your other ones. Uh, he-he, thanks. So, should we give it a shot? We're strong with the Sauce right now. This might be our best chance. Indeed, it may be. I see no harm in attempting it. Great! Here goes. Princess Sparklefeather, hear me. It's Nuke Tiptoes and we're in grave danger. The Mice Side has broken our peace treaty and is trying to start war with the Zooverse. We seek your guidance, Princess. We need our leader. - What do you think? - Little ham-handed, but you are a flesh and bone organism. Well, maybe it got through anyway. Should I try again? More? Less? I'd let that one breathe to see if it connects. You touched on the key points. - Right? - Alright then. Preparing to exit the Sauce Dimension. Oh, to leave is to die a little. Well, here we are. Back in the Zooverse, carbon-based. It looks just like we left it. No war yet. There you are. I've been looking for you guys everywhere. Rudy told me you were ambushed out there. - Where did you go? - Long story, Marty. But we're okay and that's what matters right now. Awesome! Oh, call me Slim, remember? Slim. Hey, I've been meaning to talk to you. It's so busy at work. They haven't hired a replacement for you yet, so I'm taking on all your paperwork. I may have to cut back on my fighting time again. If that's okay and everything, you know, because I did... Oh, uh, sure, Slim. We wouldn't wanna get you in trouble at work. Oh, good, thanks. I appreciate that. How's it going on locating the Gouda and Boo Boo Squeal? Uh, still working on that. Uh, uh, stand by. Kitty Clank's ship approaching. We're hit again. This is just too much! Hold on to your trunk, carbon. We're back in action. Marty, uh, I mean, Slim. Can you scramble his commands and get him off our tail? Easy-peasy, Nuke. You know my tech skills are legendary. Hu-hum. Maybe I should change my name to Techno-Slim. Slim is good, Marty. Let's just stick to the Slim right now, alright? - Can you scramble Kitty Clank's commands, pretty please? - I'm on it. No one stands up to the Mice Side and no one survives Kitty Clank. - How long, Slim? - Hold on. Uh, almost there. - Marty? - Slim. Oh, wait. I just got a bunch of papers from work I have to decode. I'll be right back. Prepare to meet your destiny, Nice Siders. - Slim! - Looks like we got company, carbon-based. A vessel is approaching. Two o'clock. Friends or foes? I'm not privy to that information, elephant. Could be either, I'd say. Oh, great. We're finished. Hey, it's Banana Rama. Long time no see, pal. For the infinite time, my name is B-52. Aah! I'll let it slide this time on account of your venerable age, Commander Ham Sanders. Ah, Banana Shamana, let it go, will you? Life is too short to get hung up on the name. Look at me, I don't even know where I am right now, and I'm still doing great. That is very Zen of you, Commander Ham Sanders. - Commander Ham Sanders, who is he? - Old pal of mine. He fought the battle of Zorex until all that was left of him were boats and his dentures, and still defeated the entire Zorex army on his own. Wow! Oh, they don't make heroes like that anymore. How in the universe are you, honey? I'm alright, besides these darn, rusty butt bolts that are giving me a hard time. Ah, butt bolts are a pain when they flare up, but... - Who is the shrimp? - Hello there, nice to see you. This shrimpy alien form? Not sure. I woke up this morning and I was in this space pod next to a shrimpy thing. No idea how I got here, and how to get out. I'm, uh, taking life as it comes. We are on a mission to help the Nice Side, Commander Ham Sanders. - Princess Sparklefeather sent us, remember? - Uh, nope. She was honeymooning at the Twin Island Planets when she intercepted a call for help from the Sparkle Express and here we are. Ah, we're hit. We're hit! Positive. Our weapons are jammed. We're losing power. One more hit and we're smoke. - Oh, great. - I see you're having a problem with that pesky metal kitty. Need a hand? If you don't mind. We've got a lot on our plate at the moment. - Could you give us a boost? - I'll do you one better. How about the brand new plutonium hydrolyzer? I'll let you have it for 10,000 space bucks. - Ha-ha. I'll do that for you. - Commander Ham Sanders, we don't have time for this right now. Let's just give these guys a boost. Alright, fine. Boost them up. Wow. You guys are rad. Commencing nuclear warp speed. Stay safe out there. Will do. Nuclear warp speed engaged. Hey, uh, where are you going? Oh, that was close. Believe it or not, that Ham Sanders was a strapping young robot at one time. Yeah, I'll take your word for it. Here we are, Chubby. Planet Bobo-Bobo. Those ice glaciers are vast, but we'll know our targets when we see them. They'll be the most savage, mighty, terrifying beasts this planet has to offer. Meek. Eh, uh, er... What's this thing? He's transmitting from the icy caps of Bobo-Bobo, most evilest Boo Boo. Do you wish to communicate? Bobo-Bobo? There must be a mistake. This cannot surely be the monstrous creature we seek. Must be another space cookie peddler. You think? Oh, goody. Chubby! We don't have time for cookies. We're assembling an army of savages. Oh, he-he, okay. - Meek. - That's right, Beep. I am Boo Boo Squeal. Leader of the Mice Side and I'm seeking Badgum and Beep. I hear they are ruthless. - Meek. - If you know where they are, speak up. Reveal their lair. I have a proposition for them, they can't refuse. - Meek, meek, meek. - Get the coordinates to this urchin, Chubby. Don't let it out of your sight, obviously. It's leading us to those warriors. Coordinates locked, Boo Boo. Well, we got away from Kitty Clank's claws. I wonder how many more things Boo Boo has in store for us. He only needs a gang because he hasn't yet gained full Sauce power. If he does that, he'll be a one-mouse army again, and no one will be able to stop him. But we stopped him once before, B. Don't you think we can do it again? I believe in the Sauce, carbon-based. With the Sauce, all things are possible. Greetings, Nice Siders. Whoa! Princess Sparklefeather. My heavens. It's the Princess. I heard your message, Nuke. I've been waiting for you to get closer, so that I can respond. Incredible! - I wielded Sauce power. - You did, Nuke. It was very smart of you to call from the Sauce Dimension. Otherwise, I'd have never known of this menace. I hope Commander Ham Sanders was of help in your mission. Yes. He saved us from Kitty Clanks claws. Wonderful. Hammy's never let me down. Princess, Boo Boo's dispatched a gang of bounty hunters to come after us. He was even able to enter the Sauce Dimension while we were there. This is terrible news. So, Boo Boo's really intent on restarting war? Yeah, but... but he hasn't gotten his little rodent hands on full Sauce power yet and he won't if we have anything to say about it. I'll handle Boo Boo Squeal, Nuke. But Princess, your honeymoon! You'll let... Honeymoon? Ugh, I'm bored. I wanna return to my warrior princley duties at once. Hooray for Princess Sparklefeather. Hooray! Oh, what kind of trickery is this? You creatures had better stop wasting my time. I'm seeking the fierce warriors Badgum and Beep. That's us. I'm Badgum. He's Beep. You've got to be kidding. Is this some kind of joke? No. What do you want, mister? You mean to tell me we located that little ball of fluffy feather for this? Oh, boy. They're so cute. - I think I'm going to melt. - Chubby? - Yes, Boo Boo? - Uh, shut it. I was told you two are the most vicious specimens this planet has to offer, is this true? We are vicious. - You are? - Absolutely. - Meek, Meek. - What can you do? We get them with cuteness. You... You what? We're so impossibly cute, you see. OMG. They are so unbelievably cute. Uh, I think I'm going to burst. That's how we work. We get them with ultimate cuteness. Nobody can survive our cuteness. Nobody. If you want to hire us, it'll cost you a bucket of sardines. - MeeK. - Two buckets. I think I'm getting a migraine. Do you need your fish oil, Boo Boo? No, I don't need my fish oil. Argh! I need evil scary creatures to assemble my army. I need to get that Sauce. If I can just regain full Sauce power, all of this can go away. No more mouthy pachyderms. No more bumbling henchmen. No more fluffy space penguins. Oh, just Sauce. Flowing, boiling, bubbling, churning Sauce. Uh-hu-huh... - Pouring, puddling... - Boo Boo. Sauce! Uh, Sauce! Hey, Boo Boo! All the Sauce power. - Boo Boo! - What? Look. The Sauce Dimension? You did it, Boo Boo. We're back in the Sauce Dimension. I did it. I did it! The Zooverse is mine. Uh, Boo Boo. Yeah, I think we have company. Princess Sparklefeather. Hello again, Boo Boo. Uh, what are you doing here? I came to stop your impossibly evil plans. Oh, yeah? We shall see about that. I'm glad you're here. We have unfinished business, you and I. I thought we had settled our business, Boo Boo. As you can clearly see, I've regained Sauce power. The peace treaty is over. It's war, Princess, and there's nothing you can do about it! That's where you're wrong, Boo Boo. You may be strong with the Sauce, but so am I. Are you challenging me? Indeed I am. Come at me, Boo. Let's see what you got. Mushroom Sauce and Tartar Sauce. Mayonnaise Sauce. That's powerful Sauce, Boo Boo. Yes, You underestimated me, Princess. Now you and all of the Zooverse will feel my wrath. Not so fast, mouse. - Eh, eh, eh? - Mayonnaise. Oh, ow. Ow, you crafty, pink pachyderm, you. - Ponzu. - Ow. - Sambal. - Argh! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get. Sauce Choron. Oh. Hollandaise. Agrodolce. Oh, no, agrodolce? No. Ha-ha. Eh, give up? Don't make me laugh. I will never give up. Surrender and join me, Princess. The Mice Side could use your talents. Me? Join the Mice Side? Never. Very well then, you leave me no choice but to destroy you. Tkemali! - Oh. - Gochujang! - Oh! - Gravy! No! Time's up, Nice Siders. Prepare to meet your maker. Time to turn up the heat on the burners, carbon-based. Are you familiar with the term, "The best defense is a good offense?" I sure am, B. Is that all you've got in your nicey-nice cannons? Take this. You never should have come back here, Princess. Your miscalculation will be your undoing. Surrender, Boo Boo. Surrender to your true nature. I know there's good in you, Boo Boo. You too have a nice side. Ah. Wow. What did you say? Time to finish this, Sparklefeather. Arrabiata sauce. - Oh. - Cocktail sauce. - Oh. - Devil's hot sauce. I know mice can be nice. You know what? Ew, no, never. Look within, search yourself, there is nice, mice can be nice. No, no, no. I'm not nice. Uh, Boo Boo. Not now, Chubby. Kiss your Nice Side and a Zooverse goodbye, Sparklefeather. It's all mine now. Just one more thing, Boo Boo. Oh, last words? By all means, what have you got to say? Hmm? Uh, Boo Boo? Shhh. Go ahead, Princess, out with it. - Duck sauce. - What? And Thua sauce. But, how? Huh? Boo Boo, uh, we're approaching the Nebula Nine wormhole. Do you want me to reverse thrusters? Eh, aw... What? Soubise. Aah! Stop. Au jus veal. No! Baham pepper sauce. Aw, oh, no. Oh, no, no! No! Boo Boo, we're nearing the Nebula Nine vacuum, we need to reverse course now or never. He can't give the order, Chubby. You need to think for yourself. Boo Boo is busy with a stare-down. Uh, think for myself? Oh boy, oh boy. Ha-ha. I get to be the villain for a change. Goodie. Uh-uhm, what would a villain do? Coot-Coot's gonna blast us to bits, B-52. Unless he runs out of laser ammunition, or we get him first, carbon-based. Keep firing. Don't worry, I will. Hey guys, I'm back. Rudy. Never happier to see you. ♪ I'll be there my friend By your side ♪ ♪ I'll be there too ♪ ♪ Let's take a ride ♪ ♪ Rudy can sing ♪ ♪ I'll be with you ♪ ♪ No matter what I'll be there too ♪ ♪ In a hardship and in glee I'll be there ♪ ♪ I'll be there my friend, you'll see ♪ Enough singing and a little more action here, guys. - By all means, say goodbye, Kit-Kit. - Oh, no! This isn't over. It is for you, Coot-Coot. Oh, wow, I'm dizzy. That's a common carbon-based weakness. Focus on a fixed point and breathe. Did I do good? You did great, Rudy, thanks. Huh. Eh, any time. Hold on, there's another transmission coming in. There are you guys are. Why do move so fast? That's the way we do things out here in space, cubicle creature. - Slim. - Oh, that reminds me, I've been thinking about this name thing, Slim Green Star sounds cool and everything, but I don't think it's really kinda for me, you know? I'm gonna stick with Marty. Oh, I think that's a great idea, Marty. Any news on the Gouda? Yep, okay, I finally got coordinates. It's coming right for you. What? The, the Gouda is coming for us? It is indeed. It's Boo Boo Squeal. What's he doing? They're nearing the Nebula Nine wormhole. Your contempt for the Zooverse is turning against you, Boo Boo. Repent and join the Nice Side. Join you? You must be living on Sauce. It's the Sparkle Express. Alright, it's time to play villain while Boo Boo is busy in the stare-down. Arming laser guns. Yes, yes, yes. Fire. Take that, Sparkle Express. I'm an evil pachyderm. I'm so evil. Not again. Hold on tight, living organism. Someone's Sauce power must win, Princess. I agree, Boo Boo, bring it. - Peanut. - Tomato sauce. Chutney. - Oh. - Pesto. Eugh. Soy. No. Creole. Ooh, you're a formidable foe, Princess. It's going to be a shame to defeat you. Ha-ha. Likewise, Boo Boo. It's not too late. Eh, oh, but it is, pink pachyderm. It is. - Sauce Espagnole. - Salsa. No. Ew, it's not over, I won't concede defeat. I still possess Sauce power. Oh, no. Boo Boo, I think we're being sucked into the wormhole. What? Er, uh, um... Why? Well, I was trying to act as the villain-in-chief, uh, since you were occupied with your, your guest, eh, eh. Initiated a laser battle with the Sparkle Express and then... The Sparkle Express? Ugh. They're here? Yes, Boo Boo, but it seems as if the battle with the Sparkle Express caused the Gouda to lose its trajectory, and now we're spinning out of control towards the wormhole. Wormholes erase everything, Boo Boo. It's back to square one for you. And you too. It's too late to escape, you're going down with us. That's where you're wrong. I was never here to begin with, you're talking to a hologram. - What? - Yup. No! I wanna thank you two for fighting so hard to defend the Zooverse. The Nice Side is truly honored to have you in its service. Ah, uh, oh, shucks. Uh-huh, thanks, Princess. I'm not heroic, I'm just programmed in that way. Humble as always, B-52. Don't ever change. It's not possible, Princess, my motherboard is fixed on hero. Well, that's good to know. Where are we, Chubby? In the 37th quadrant. Just around the Twin-Island planets, Boo Boo. Ooh, aah, he-he. Oh, goodie. I need a vacation. Chubby, set coordinates to Twin-Island planets and, uh, book me a suite at the Six Space Seasons. Right away, Boo Boo. Uh, what about evil, Boo Boo? Got any new plans? Nah. Let somebody else take on evil duty for a while. Oh, I need a massage. So, the Nice Side reigns victorious, and the Mice Side is vanquished, eh? And those fools actually think peace will last, but they've forgotten all about me. They thought it was bad before, well, wait till they get a load of fl... Chewflies!
