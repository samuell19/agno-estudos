Are you gonna swig on that thing all by yourself? Or are you gonna be neighborly and share? A body could dehydrate itself out here in this here humidity. I bet a gentleman would share his refreshments with a lady. - Come on Abigail I believe that'd be getting a little bit too mushy you know what I mean? I mean we ain't going steady or nothing like that. - I ain't asking you to go steady Benjamin Ladner. I want a sip of your root beer. Better yet you know you could buy me one. - Well I reckon you can have a sip but I ain't got no money for a whole bottle. - This will do fine. Thank you kind sir. - Holy cow you pretty near drained, I said a sip. - Oh my stars Benjamin Ladner. Do you realize our lips touched the exact same bottle?

I sure hope these weren't the blessed ones. You know what I mean? God might have put some kind of curse on us for stealing them. - We ain't steeling them. We're just borrowing them for a bit. Man, our own canoe. As long as we keep it out of sight we don't have to worry about getting caught. - Just know, if we do get caught... I'm gonna rat on you. - Look alligators. Gotcha. [Calm MUSIC] Come on I want to show you something. I wanted to see if the coast is clear. [Bell RINGING] I know where they keep the money around here that ain't in the register. Saw Ned put it in a box, it's in here. Whoa, look at all these hundreds. - Man you better put it back Ben. - Man I ain't never seen a $100 bill before, you either. - How much you reckon's in there? - I don't know, I don't know. Could be thousands. - Man you better put it back. Your old man must be coming around the corner any minute. Come on! - I wanna see how much is in here. [Toilet FLUSHING] [Birds CHIRPING] You asked your mom about sleeping on the river right? - Yeah, she ain't too keen on it. But I'm pretty sure I can talk her into it. - Well you gotta somehow. It's gonna be neat, think of it Cory. We'll be out there all by ourselves just like the settlers did back in the old days. Don't pack a lunch or nothing. Let's force ourselves to live off the land. - Great... fish for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Oh that'll be fun. - Well we ain't got no guns for shooting game so fishing is how we're gonna survive. - Well, if you're counting on me we're gonna starve. 'Cause you know my luck with fishing. I think somebody put a sign on my face that says do not bite. - Hey I was just wondering. Do you think Father Dominic saw you take, I mean borrow those candles? - Nah I don't think so. I wish you'd stear clear of these tree limbs. You want a snake falling in this thing? Speaking of snakes, I saw creepy Abigail at school the other day and she was asking about you. - Cut it out man. - Ben and Abigail sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G! [Calm MUSIC] Almost there. - There we go Cory. - Reach. - Alright pull pull, hurry up. [Calm MUSIC] - Come on let's go! Race you to the happy log. - I'll beat you there, I'm gonna beat you there. - Let me go. [Upbeat MUSIC] - Hey we got some smokes around here don't we? - Yeah they're around here somewhere. I buried them pretty good, aw dang. - Let me look. - Nah man nah, I've got it. Yep here they are. How sweet it is. I can't get this thing to light. - It won't light because they're wet. Give me one of them. - Well like it's a real man's cigarette, ain't got no filter on it. [COUGHING] - Dang, this stuff'll kill you. - Sure ain't lying, it's pretty good. Cory, think a girl could get pregnant off of a kiss? - You did it, you kissed Abigail? - No no, wait wait, I didn't kiss her, she kissed me. - Oh my God. [Ben SIGHS] Oh no, I think that's worse. - [Ben:] Cut it out man. - It don't make no difference. Her lips touching yours is all it takes. Man don't you know nothing about the birds and the bees? Didn't your pa teach you anything? Once the saliva's mixed there's no turning back. That's how a baby's made man everybody knows that. - No no no wait, wait wait. It has to be uh... a french kiss you know, a tongue kiss with the saliva and all. - Oh stop, you're grossing me out. I'm gonna be sick. And the germs, didn't you stop to think about the germs? What's wrong with you? You had to go make her pregnant. Her father's gonna find out and he's gonna kill you. Father Dominic's gonna find out and you're going straight to hell. You're alter boy days are over. This is a mortal sin. - Come on Cory cut it out this isn't funny. - Zoom, bang, wham, straight to the moon Alice. Yep straight to hell, no purgatory. I mean everybody's gonna know. How you gonna fix this one? You gotta fake confession, and there she stands behind you. - Stop it. - Big as a house. [Dramatic MUSIC] [Calm MUSIC] Come on turn us Ben. I think we're over it. - Good hurry up. Hey Dad. - Hey Mr. Ladner. - Don't tell me. - Come on Dad, anybody around here got some money for a root beer? - Not that I know of. - Come on Dad. - Come on Dad. Alright, don't you boys be asking me no more this week okay? Think money just grows on trees huh? Get out the way. [Dramatic MUSIC] [Engine CRANKS] [Bell RINGING] [Dramatic MUSIC] Be right with you Mister. - I'm looking for a Mr. Ned Buzby, proprietor of Buzby Service Station. I'm Mr. Johnson from the Internal Revenue Service. [Suspenseful MUSIC] [Mrs. Quavis CRYING] - Mrs. Quavis, I'm so glad to see you back in church. May I speak with you for a moment? - Yeah. - Okay. [She SIGHS] Have you ever heard Cory pray? - No. - Well I have, and do you know what he prays about, you. - Me? Oh... I been worried about him. He hasn't cried since Jimmy. Oh... that river took my husband. And now Cory has no daddy. - Mrs. Quavis, the river didn't take your husband. Gambling did. You are a good mother. And a good daddy. [Owl HOOTING] - The boys helped me out around the station today. They were actually useful for a change. - Dad. - No really son, I appreciated y'all taking care of things. [Phone RINGING] - Never fails, just sit down to eat and that thing starts ringing off the hook. [Phone RINGING] Hello, who? Abigail. - No wait Mom, I'm not here. - Yes he's here. But hun we just sat down for dinner. Do you think I could have him call you back? - No. - Okay. Mhm. Bye bye now. Well well Benjamin, she called you Benjamin. I think somebody's sweet on you. - Come on Mom, cut it out. - You don't have to call her back. She just wanted to leave a message. She said I haven't gained an ounce. Well I'm surprised about that. The way her mama cooks, that family could stand to lose a pound or two. - Now Julie come on now, that ain't nice. - Oh hun I'm just "fun-ing", what's wrong? - Ned, he never even showed up today. Strangest thing, yesterday a man comes in and I ain't never seen him before, asking about him. Knew his name too. Down right rude, kinda mean looking you know? Could almost tell he's bad people. And today an IRS agent shows up. - What do you reckon is going on? - I don't know. Think I'm gonna head over to the house and check things out though. - Wait I don't like the sound of this. Do you think you ought to call Mac about this? - I don't know Julie. Ned'll just show up and I got Mac out there looking for him. Ned'll be mad as all get out. - Dad, are you worried? - Let me put it this way son. It just ain't like Ned not to show up and check on his business. - So anyway Mom last week I asked about if me and Cory could sleep out on the river and you said it was okay. So I'm just reminding you that tomorrow's the night. - Wait, I don't remember you asking us about this. Darryl, did he ask you? - Huh, let the boy go. - What did Mrs. Quavis say? - She said it was okay really Mom. - Don't be lying to me boy. I'm gonna call Mrs. Quavis to be sure. - Go ahead son, I feel like fish tomorrow. Don't let me down now. - Yes sir. Trust me if they're biting, you'll be eating the fish. [Somber MUSIC] - Mac, yeah it's Darryl. Listen... I got a problem and I don't know if it's serious or not but it's about Ned. [Birds CHIRPING] [Suspenseful MUSIC] [Ben SCREAMS in pain] - Rise and shine Huckleberry Finn. [Upbeat MUSIC] - [Ben:] We're going now! - Do you think those kids we stole this canoe from would recognize us if they saw us? - Hope not, besides we didn't steal the canoe we borrowed it, there is a difference you know. - I don't feel right about this. If we get caught, how are we gonna explain to our parents that we got it? - You know what Cory you worry too much. Besides we're not gonna get caught. - I can't believe my mom said it was okay to sleep out tonight. - Yeah me too, I was kinda afraid she wouldn't let you on account of your dad and all. - Yeah, I know, I hardly recognize my mom ever since my daddy was murdered. I don't want to talk about it Ben. - Okay Cory I'm sorry. But just know if ever do want to talk about it I'm here. Hope we have enough candles to light up all night. You know, keep the animals and stuff away. - Well we'll just have to make do. - You know how long a flashlight would last us? How many did you bring? - Four. I just know I'm going to hell for this borrowing. [Calm MUSIC] [Twangy country guitar MUSIC] - Come on Clyde, deal me a good hand here, make some money. - Hey Ned. - Hey girl how you doing? - It's hot as Hades out there but it's worse in here. - Yeah it is a little bit warm in here, especially when you're around.

[Birds CALLING] - This river just ain't the same at night. - Yeah, it gives me creeps. Ain't like that in the daytime. - Let's just pretend it's daytime. - I ain't scared, I ain't scared, no way, no how. [Birds CALLING] - You brought the smokes didn't you?

I gotta level with you on something. - Yeah, what? - Well, this river kinda scares me a bit now. I ain't ever had that feeling before. Paddling down the river at night, I just thought of something... awful, like my dad's body being in this river for three days. Do you know he even looked like after three days? He didn't have no eyes Ben, fish got to him. And also gators took a couple chunks of him too. Why do you think we couldn't show his body? - Cory. - You know what, I'm starting to hate this river. - Cory, you're dad's body is not in this water. He's in Heaven with the good Lord, I know that's right. - I miss him Ben, Mama does too. I hear her off in her bedroom crying every night. I don't know what to do. - Hate hearing that about your mama Cory. I know it's been really hard on her. No man around the house. - What in hell are you talking about?! What do you think I am?

Why you asking all that? - Just wondering. If you ever did, would you tell me? Just so I know what it's like. - What makes you think I'd do it before you anyways? - With a baby on the way. [PUNCH] - What? - You and Abigail are practically married. - [Ben:] Cut it out man. - She ain't all that bad. - Yeah I know. But I saw her mama in church the other day and I got to thinking, she's kinda fat and all. - Yeah? - I think that's how Abigail might turn out and that would scare me. Here we are married, sleeping one day, she just rolls over and squashes me. [Calm MUSIC] - Oh ain't nothing to be scared of. Stick your head outside of the tent and see if anybody out there wants to kill us.

[Dramatic MUSIC] - [Cory:] Hey can you get those matches? - Yeah. Cory, we're best friends right? - Sure why? - I don't know, something about hearing it you know. Just makes a body feel better. My dad said if you have one good friend, you're the richest man in the world. - Then I'm a rich man Ben. My daddy must have been awful rich. He had a lot of friends. Not an enemy in this world. Except maybe one. If I tell you something, you promise not to tell anyone? 'Cause if you do... the sheriff might come arrest me. - Okay, I promise. - Well, having these dreams at night about, finding this guy and killing him. - You serious? - Damn right. My daddy got shot in the back and I ain't standing for it. - And you got on to me about stealing candles. That ain't even breaking no commandment. I think the worst thing is when you go to killing folk. The fourth commandment, thou shalt not kill. - You meant the sixth commandment? - I mean at our age, how many commandments we gotta break before we go straight to hell? - Next to none. - I think it's better to die young. That way you ain't got as much time to screw up you know. - Yeah I ain't in no hurry to get to Heaven. 'Cause you gotta die first. - Yeah who wants to die? - All right. I don't want to talk about it anymore Ben. - Okay. We should just go to sleep you know everything will look different in the morning. - Yeah you're right. well, goodnight buddy. - Goodnight Cory. - [Cory:] Ben? - [Ben:] What, what, what? - Don't dream about Abigail tonight. - Don't start.
