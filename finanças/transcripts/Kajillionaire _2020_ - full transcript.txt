- Five seconds. - After this person. - And clear. - Not clear. - Go. - No. Now. This could be cash. No. Money order. Twenty. Oh, I think they sell these at... I have a receipt that'll work for this. - Hmm. - Toys and games. 12.99, Target. Easy return. So, this is, this is not a cheap tie. Well, you can't see it, because you're not of gentle birth. It's empty! Althea and Victor Young. 4305 Fairglen Road, Ladera Heights. Oh. We could take the 2. It goes there from here. We got time. Um, do the Catholic schoolgirl costume. 'Cause you've got some heartstrings to pull. And remember, don't ask for a reward. Just let them come to you. - You got the watch, right? - Yeah. Wow. Look at this. It was just right there. I almost stepped on it. All this time, it was just right there. Yeah. Do you go to Sacred Heart? Our daughter Jenny went to Sacred Heart. Here, let's have you in for a Coke. I've always believed in angels. Not me. That's her thing. What's this? It's a gift certificate. Their daughter's a masseuse. "Don't ask for a reward" was plan A. Plan B was "ask for a reward." Rich people can be very cheap sometimes. They were talking about her nonstop. - She works at Mélisse, she went to college... - Mélisse? They were obsessed. It was creepy. That's the most expensive restaurant in L.A. - She just works there. - Well, uh, even to work there, you have to be rich. - Oh. I mean, I... - Wait a minute. Wait. 4305 1/2 Fairglen Road. 4... 4503 1/2 Fairglen... You-you were just... Well, you were just there. But th-this is, this is the house right behind it. - This is worth money. - Yeah. Yeah. - See, dollar signs. - Yeah. This-this... This type of high-end, uh... you know. - It's good. Yeah. - It's worth $200 or $300. Yeah. Okay, um... Wait. Cash refund. Okay. What about a percentage of the total value? Like 75% of the total value. No. No, that's not how... I'm sorry. How do you, how do you know my parents? Or what about an exchange, um, for that rock? - No. - No? Okay. - Mm-mm. - What about these? No? Understood. This. This, uh, this shelf. And that's gonna be my final, because it's just... it's not worth very much and I'm gonna be taking a loss on-on... ...on the massage. I'll take that. Well, you don't want a massage, right? How long does this usually take? Uh, your gift certificate is for 60 minutes, so... Oh. N-No. I-I don't need, um... could... Do you think we could do it in 20? Okay. Okay. So just tell me if it's too much pressure. It's too much pressure. - Is this better? - Too much. How about this? Is that better? Yeah. - Hi. - We're with her. It was taking a while, so... No refund? No. I don't refund gifts, but we're almost done. She only wanted 20 minutes. Okay, can we have that rock for the other 40 minutes? We won the Vitafusion giveaway under six different names today. Oh. And the Motor Trend Dodge Viper GT Sweepstakes. - That's a free visor. - The little ones are popping! Pop, pop, pop! They're all popping! Just st-stop. Hey. Okay? Who's in charge of the, um... A sport water bottle, BPA-free, with a carabiner. - Huh. - I don't think we've won that before. Not bad for a Wednesday. Hey, yo! Hey. Hey! Hey, you guys? I h... - I have a job. - Shut the fuck up. - Keep walking, keep walking. - Ah. - Fuck. - February? March? April? Come on, man, this tank's empty. Uh, we may have to pay in installments. - In install... No. - Yeah. No! No install... I mean, rent is an installment. It's a monthly installment. We'll have it in the morning. All... February, March, April, all 1,500. Just, uh... yeah, we were just, we were just talking about a job right now. - We were, just now. - Yeah. - You only pay 500 a month? - But it leaks. It's very manageable. Very manageable. It's... it leaks on-on a schedule. Y-You're patting down the wall afterwards, right? - Oh, yeah. - That's good. The dampness becomes rot, and then the whole building collapses. Hey, fire up that compressor, will you? Very expensive. Are you okay? It's my condition. - He's got a... - I mean, I-I have no filters. It's no big deal. Ignore it. See you in the morning. Okay, we'll see you. The other side! Uh, I-I'm supposed to take this class. It's a required thing by my caseworker, but I'm kind of in the midst of something, so if she could just go, there's... there's a sign-up sheet. Come on. I-I know you guys do this stuff. Tell them about the money! I can pay $20. You heard? Yeah, well, what about the... Yeah, so hurry up so we can go. Thanks. - I like your... - Yeah. What's your name? Kelli. What's your name? It's for the sign-up sheet. Oh. It's Kelli Fain. Kelli with an "I," F-A-I-N. You don't even have to go in. Just get the yellow slip and come right back. Oh, Fain. I need a yellow slip. Okay. Dorinda can give you that. Uh, she's inside. We're starting a little late. Maybe the time change threw some people off. - L-Let's take a seat, please. - But it's only twice. - Well, here's your slip. - Okay. Thanks, Dorinda. Have a seat. Let's get started. If you need a caseworker receipt from Dorinda, you can get it later at the break. Okay. There are worksheets coming from both directions. Uh, take one and pass it down. - Could you pass it? - The blue one is the nutrition cheat sheet that I mentioned to you yesterday. Please take a look at the pink sheet, the one that says "The Breast Crawl" on top. Will you start the tape, please? Thank you. Okay, this is great. This is the mother-baby bond at work. Oh. If the newborn is immediately placed on the mother's abdomen, he makes his way all the way to the breast all by himself. Now, if a baby's placed on a cot, the infant mortality goes up. The bonding goes down. The lactation goes down. All that important stuff that we talked about yesterday. You remember? Baby's mouth opens as he approaches the nipple. And the bonding begins. Shit, girl, what'd you do, enroll? What did I miss? Uh, the... breast crawl and... Oh, yeah. I'm gonna do that. That's cool, huh? No, you don't want to baby it like that. It'll-it'll get all... Thank you for waiting. Someone will be with you shortly. What are you doing? Uh... Sorry, uh... I just... We won something big, but we can't use it. Uh, it's the Ooh La Luxe getaway. It's a first-class trip for two to the Big Apple, and it's redeemable for three nonrefundable coach tickets. - You'll never fly. - I know. So, maybe we... What is that? Guy at the class gave me them. Do... Do you want one? When a man gives you wood, anything made out of wood, he's saying, "You give me wood." I've been to New York. You and I could go together, just the two of us. Like a... mother-daughter getaway. Oh, hey, Stovik. There you are. That's a great jacket. You pat it down? Yeah. - Oh, Theresa, I... - Oh. Mm-hmm. Uh, the rest is coming. Uh, we're just on our way. We have to, uh... - What is this? - Ah, that's a money order. - Same as money. - $20. We have to check our mail, and, uh... Well... Oh, that. Now, see, that... I think that's worth 50... Not this time. Wha...? I can't do this anymore. Are you crying? I'm patching the leak. I'm evicting you. I can get $10,000 for this space, you understand? $10,000. We have a child. That wall is a sponge. It's a sponge. This building ought to be condemned, really. We could, we could report it to the Department of Health and Human Services! What? Okay, okay. Just-just, just give us till Friday. You'll have 1,500 in cash bills. We'll have it by Friday. Dude, we need a little time to get it together. Friday tomorrow? It's tomorrow? Um, well, I didn't literally mean... I mean, that's just a saying, you know, "by Friday." - It just means end of the week. - Next Friday. Uh, uh, the-the one after that. - Friday after next. - Yeah. Two weeks. Uh-huh. Two weeks. Shit! We don't have time to be horsing around. That was our best thing. It's a new camera. I didn't know. This is really bad. - Mm-hmm. - Once your face is in their system, - they got you... fines, 401, home equity. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. But maybe you want all that. I don't know. Me? I prefer to just skim. - So do I. - Do you? Ah, that's interesting. Because most people want to be kajillionaires. That's the dream. That's how they get you hooked. Hooked on sugar, hooked on caffeine. Ha-ha-ha. Cry-cry-cry. Mother-daughter getaway. How the fuck does that help us get the rent? God. Come on! Think! Okay, so... We all fly to New York together on Wednesday, and then we fly right back as strangers. So, at the baggage carousel, we don't know each other. Don't-don't look at me. I'm looking around. I want to make sure these are our bags. - Oh. - Excuse me, sir. Is this the luggage for the flight from New York? You two know each other. - We're a couple? - Yeah. Oh. I see. I am the dum-dum now. I have a bachelor's degree. She doesn't even know what that is. Then you accidentally take my bags and go home. I'll stay at the airport and report my loss. Luckily, I have traveler's insurance, so they'll issue us a check for, uh, um... ...$1,575, which we can just sign right over to Stovik the next day and be, uh, more than a full week early. Ladies and gentlemen, uh, we're experiencing some choppy air here. Please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts. We'll be going up to 37,000 feet for a smoother ride. Okay, come on. Come on. Okay. Okay. Just breathe normally. Just breathe normally. All right, talk. Let's talk. Okay? Talk. Let's say something. Just say something. Don't pray. God, are you praying? Just talk. Talk. Okay. How are you? Um... How are you? What are your interests? - My interests? - Your interests. Your interests. Your interests! - Your interests! Go. Go. - I-I don't know. I don't... - What do you want me to... - I don't know. Just say anything. Uh... Some people think that a brand-new baby, if you, if you, if you put it on the abdomen, it'll just automatically crawl up to the mom's breast. But if you put it on a cot, then it'll, I guess, cry more. But a breast crawl baby... Don't say "breast." I just wonder how-how a baby would know - how, where... - Shh. Stop. It's smooth now. What was the point of all that? He told me to talk. Are you pregnant? Did I crawl up, or was I put on a cot? Answer. No. How would that have even happened? A cot. Is she pregnant? No. Uh, my mom lives in New Jersey. We're not that close. I mean, we... like, hardly ever talk now that I live in L.A. Uh, I've been here almost a year, and, ugh, it's so hard to meet people. Do you guys find that? Okay. What else? Um... Um, um, um, um, um, um. I live in Highland Park, above Thrive. So, is this the kind of thing that you... Yeah, just keep talking. - Anything. Anything. Uh, just anything. - Um... - Okay, um... - Anything. Go. Go. Go. I am a, uh, physician's assistant in ophthalmology at Cedars-Sinai. Is this the normal amount of turbulence for this route? Yes. - Really? - Totally. It's... Oh, no! What? Oh. I thought that I forgot my headphones. Did they say that there was Wi-Fi on this plane? I don't remember. Oh, there is. Oh, you got to pay. - Why do they do that? - You're better off. Oh, this? Oh, I know. Trust me, I'm the worst. I, like, sleep with it. It's like my third arm. It's a tool. It was originally designed by and for the military and the intelligence community. The CIA and Army ground ops, specifically. It is a powerful and it's a dangerous tool. You don't have a cell phone? - I use it as it was intended. - Hi. And I don't dress it up - and play dolly with it. - Oh. Well, then don't meet my mom. She is... whew! - Here you are. - She is always on her phone. I'm talking about, like, always on her phone. - Oh! Yes! - Here you are. - Screwdriver for her. - I don't want it. I... Gin and tonic, gin and tonic. Here, open up that bad boy. Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Trust me, this will help a lot. Salud. Um, my only concern is that we won't be thinking clearly enough in the event of a real emergency. - It's possible. - Oh, are you...? My aunt has a friend who's Amish. No, we're not Amish. - We use alcohol. - Oh. When we're injured, to numb the pain. Okay, that sounds Amish. Look, I know there's a lot of discrimination. My friend used to go to a Quaker school. And let me... - That's super random. - Uh... Uh, oh. Okay! All right! Chug, chug. Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug. Yes! Let's get this party started. You never lived in Providence? I never did. It's so weird. - Mm-hmm. - There's a girl there who looks just... He's staring at your... blouse. Oh, I know. I can handle it. Mm-hmm? Okay. All right, everybody. Check your pockets. - It may be a bait and switch. - A what? A distraction. He might be a pickpocket. - You mean a thief? - Yeah. That-that is, that is not what just happened. You don't know about these things. I don't... No. This happens to me, like, every day. What? So... what is it that you guys do? Oh, come on. You know everything about me, right? You know where I live and what my grandma's name is. So, like, what are, what are you, what are you guys, like... professors? Yep. Yeah? Well, that was a really great guess. No. No, you're not. Uh-uh, uh. You're, like, um... Would you consider yourself a trustworthy person? - Is that one of your qualities? - You don't have to answer that. Yes. Oh. We have something very big happening at the airport. Oh, my God, I knew you guys were up to something. All right, there's two of us and there's three bags. Do you see where I'm going with this? Not at all. You took it? Really? Put it back. Oh, yeah. I-I-I feel it. I... - Do you? - I felt it. I-I... Mm. Okay. That old bag. Here we go. Yep. Thank you. All right. Is that the last one? She has a lot of... way too many shoes. - Oh. - You got everything? Okay. Off we go. All right, so if they are lost, and I'm not saying they are, but if they are, your traveler's insurance covers you for up to $1,575. You get that as soon as the loss is verified. H-How long does that usually take? Oh, they're pretty quick. Six weeks at the longest. A-And the shortest? Oh, that really varies. But don't worry. It's really rare that we completely lose a bag. I'm sure they'll turn up. Yeah, it's a pretty good deal here. Oh, she's here. Don't worry, I got this. Ma'am, I'll show you right to your seat. Just go with it. How much did you get for the bags? These guys at my college used to do the same scam with their luggage at Christmas vacation. - I think you can get more... - It's-it's, it's an original con. - I invented it. - Oh, okay. What? I don't know if the check will be here by Friday. What? It might, but... it might take six weeks. In six weeks? That's too late. We just flew... I just risked my life for... Sorry. In six weeks? Who knows? It could come sooner. It varies. Right. What could come sooner? The check? Who even is she? How is this person an asset? I don't... I don't understand. Maybe I'll go to the restroom. - It's broken. - Huh? You have to use the one outside by the gas station. Right. Oh. - Yes? - There you are, hon. I've been calling nonstop. Sorry, I had it on airplane mode. Oh, so... Okay. So you landed. You're home. Good. I'm watching that antique show. Do you have it on? Uh, yeah. You can... Why don't you go to sleep and we can just talk tomorrow or some... Are you in bed, all cozy? Put that wool pillow under your knees. I'm using mine. It's so nice. You have something nice and crunchy to eat? I can't see your face very well. - It's so dark. - The light's broken. Oh. Mm. All right. I'm ordering you a stick-on light, like the one in your old room. Okay, I know. Just which one? What time is it there? Our schedules are so out of sync. I know you'll feel better when we're aligned back, but that's impossible now. - Yeah, and I... - Okay, so it'll come Tues... No. Yes. Tuesday. Uh-huh. Did you get the case of iced tea? Mm. I saw something this morning that made me think of you. This is gonna make you so happy. Type in "Vemo infusion pitcher." Look on the bottom picture, and then zoom in, zoom in, zoom back to... Oh! This guy's old rocking chair... it's worth a half a million. I had no idea. No. He's so surprised. He had no... I have a heist we can do, to get the 1,500. Okay, I'm just gonna start, I'm gonna start talking. Okay. So, I'm, um... I'm not a physician's assistant. That was, um... I don't even know why I said that. Anyway... I work at Abram's Optics in the Galleria, which, if you don't know, is the worst branch there is. Honestly, I'm wasting my life there. I just sell bifocals to agro old people all day. Mean but, like, also super lonely and desperate, you know? Like, I've been invited to Easters and to Mahjong and to look at scrapbooks and... You know, I don't go because it's gross, but if I did, I bet you that I would find mad antiques. - Huh. - Yeah. I mean, not super fancy ones, but I have a feeling that if I said I liked something, they would give it to me for free or cheap, and then we can sell it and turn a tidy profit. Boom! Who do we sell the antiques to? We can... we can get a stall at the flea market. I love the flea market. It is so indie. That is a great idea. It's just tremendous. Right? Three-way split. Oh, yeah, sure. Of course. No problem. It's like an internship. I'm Melanie. All right, okay. Uh, Melanie, meet Old Dolio. Old... what? Dolio. Old Dolio. Okay. I like that. I like that. See, this is exactly the kind of thing that I've been wanting... - Don't touch! - Ah! Don't touch the table. I've been through tremors a lot smaller than this. It just turns everything electric, like zap. 'Cause this is the way the big one starts. With the noise, it just keeps building and building and building. But this one's not building. The big one will be loud. I mean, if you're lucky, you'll get crushed. And then you'll... you just die right then and there. Immediately. - A never-ending void. - Wow. So, YOLO. Am I right? They are real characters, super unique. But you vouch for them, right? Vouch? I just mean on, like, a level of basic safety. I had a friend who did stripping, and I would never do that, but this feels like a little more... Okay. You know, if I'm being honest, my favorite movies are the Ocean Eleven movies. And I just am pretty psyched about being on, like, an actual heist. How did you meet them? They're my parents. - Oh. - Hey, hey. That's an interesting blouse. Thank you. You know, it was actually a-a dress. And then I just... I like your tr-tracksuit. Sue! You look so great! Here we are. This is m-my family. I love these, Sue. Aren't they great? My husband gave them to me. He got them in England. My ancestors were British on both sides. I think the people are more civilized there. - 4:00 tea and all that. - This is great. Sue. - I love this dog. - Oh. Blimey! I've made a wretched mess, I'm afraid. Oh, that's all right, Mum. No bother, really. I-I didn't realize at first that you were... But you're not British. No. No. You're too dark. There are dark people everywhere. I know. I just meant what you think of when you imagine a... She's adopted. Yeah. We always say we were given one and we chose one. Oh. That's just how I feel about my Doodlebug. - Come here, baby. Yeah. - Doodlebug. That's a beautiful name. - Is that... - It's French. Mm. 650? - We need 1,500. - We don't want to push it. Deposits over 700 trigger a bank review, so we'll do this a few more times. Well, two more by Friday. - Yeah. - What? No. No, this is... If we get caught, it-it'll be much worse for me because I'm Puerto Rican. Isn't that amazing? Old Dolio learned to forge before she learned to write. Well, actually, that's how she did learn to write. What about my plan? I mean, was that just... Your plan to cash in on the generosity of lonely people? Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Ow! You knocked off my nail. I... I mean, what am I... I'm gonna have to take them all off now, because I'm gonna look like a crazy person with just, like, one nail missing. What are you...? Oh, okay. I can... You need, like, special nail polish remover for that. Oh, uh, yep, yep, yep, yep. This is a very liquid and high-yield deal. - That's right. It's a nice design. - Um... I mean, I hadn't noticed. - It's kind of chic. - Actually... I think we should give that to Stovik right now - and tell him the rest is coming. - Howdy-do. Howdy-do. Howdy-do. Howdy-do. Look at this guy. Look at... Oh. I feel like a senator. Ah. I love hot tubs. What color is your bathroom? Do you think this one will match? This, like, smoky, coraly thing? Stop it. You can just slide right in. Come on in, Old Dolio. I don't think you're supposed to get in that. Sure, you can. It's a dry test. Get on in there. Yeah. Just make yourselves comfy. Here, let me, let me help you out. - Uh, I... I can do it. I can... - Oops. Yeah. Yeah. Get yourselves comfortable. Grab a seat. Plenty to choose from. Yep. Uh... Okay, now, I want you guys to imagine hot water right up to here. Okay? I'll get in there with you. Hey. Yep. Sorry. 47 adjustable massaging heads with targeted neck and shoulder jets. A cascading waterfall, uh, creating a soothing ambience. - Oh. - Uh-huh. Uh, there's an ambiance. Should I go on or...? She's sold, right? How much is it? 9,499. Okay? Just $150 down and $99 a month, with, uh, 29% APR financing. So, you... w-we pay $150, we can walk away with it? Yeah. Well, not this exact one. It has to ship from the warehouse. But by the end of the day tomorrow. That's 150. Um, so if I'm not happy, uh, I can return it at any point and get a full refund? Well, once it's installed, you can't... Oh, ins... yeah. Yeah, yeah. In-Installed, of course. But if it hasn't been installed? Then sure. Yeah. - You know, like, if it doesn't fit or if the color's off. - Ah. And, now, um, the cladding is extra. I have a suggestion for you. What? Wear more clothes. You're making everybody feel uncomfortable. I'll get a full refund? Okay, we got to be in and out so we can catch the leak by 5:00. Okay. Honestly, I'm kind of excited because this guy is such a creep. So, his name is Abe. Oh, God, this feels like Mission: Impossible. Okay. Okay, so he's what we call a no-show. He didn't pick up his glasses, so I had to give him a reminder call, and when I did, he asked if I can come and deliver, which I said normally we wouldn't do that. But when I told him that I was bringing my family, he, like, was crying. Like, so desperate. It was... It's open. So I just... I just, um... Okay. Hi. I'm not feeling well, but, please, make-make yourself at home. That's it. Just be how you are at home. Just a normal day around the house. I think he's just lonely. Oh, he's pretending. He wants us to... Right, like we're his family. He's only two strokes back right now, and the only thing... Good. That's good. M-My son used to watch that. Oh, Robert, always with the sports. Why don't you mow the lawn for once? Nice. Do more like that. How was school, hon? School was fine. How was your day? A little louder, please. How was your day? What did you do today, Mom? That's nice... to be asked that. You really want to know? Huh. Wasn't easy. None of my days are easy. Why? What happened? The refrigerator broke. It's not in there. - So, uh... - Not that drawer. Try the other drawer. You must be the refrigerator repair person. Okay. I bet you meet a lot of lonely women when you're out in the field. Repairing refrigerators. Housewives must be throwing themselves at you, huh? 'Cause, uh... You know, if you need tools, we have tools. Uh, I'm just here to do a job. Hey. Checkbook is not here. Check his bedroom. Come on. This is hard. It's like trying to fall asleep forever. It sounds good. Maybe some silverware clinking. Or play the piano. I think it's in there, but we have to wait. It's 4:15. We'll miss the leak. He's trying to... ...die. But we should, we should keep on, um... He said he wants piano playing and s-silverware clinking. How was school, hon? It was fine. But I'm starving. M-Me, too. Would you like some leftover cake? Okay. Oh! - He just scored? - Oh, he scored a-a one-holer. Do you think I could have some of that? Would you like some milk? Please. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, I think I will mow the lawn tomorrow. You said that last weekend. Did I? Maybe I'll mow the lawn. I'll just go into the garage and get it out. Okay. Go check. Go. Am I still here? Yeah. You see how there's light? You'll know because it'll be dark all around and... quiet. Please... don't do anything to the house. My kids have plans for it. They're not bad kids. Just busy. Life is... nothing. Just let it go without really thinking about it. Like you're letting go of a... piece of string. Just let it... It's not that big of a deal. Oh, no. Oh, my God. What's wrong? What's wrong? This... Oh. No, I-I mean... She has tender feelings. You wouldn't know anything about that. I know. Oh, there's no checkbook. You're sad is what you are. Huh? I'm not gonna do this again. And-and I don't think that we should take anything from him. Okay, okay. So here we are. Oh, I don't know. Somewhere there's a checkbook in this house, and, uh, when we find it, we're just gonna... we're gonna cash out the whole $850 and be done with it, because, quite frankly, I'm feeling very uncomfortable. I've been put in an uncomfortable position, so... Go run the buckets. You can still make it if you take the 53, huh? Come on, hurry. Hurry. Oh, my... So, I know. Okay. No, no. You sit down. S-Sit down, and you have a glass of water and... And your son is how old? Three. And his name is? Cyrus. Cy. Okay. Hi, Cy. I mean, he would, too, uh, especially with new people. I mean, he just goes ballistic. - It's... - Okay. Okay, that's good. So, we know now that we have a three-year-old that tends to hit. Okay. That's not abnormal. So, first, I'll just observe. Okay? All right. Are you... hungry? Mm, no. Are you tired? Mm... no. You look excited, Cy. Are you excited to see the other children? - Do you just need some of their attention? - Yeah. Yeah! Okay. And sometimes that's enough. Just verbalizing the need is enough. A three-year-old that wants attention... not unreasonable, right? Old Dolio. You should... well, if you want to. She might do one more. No. How about we do it together? Maybe you get the party started. I'll just go, uh, check the-the front. Okay. I don't think Old Dolio likes me. Oh. No, she-she, she doesn't like anyone. She's not like that. And your daughter's name is? Old Dolio. Uh, Old...? Dolio. We named her after a homeless guy who won the lottery, hoping he'd put her in his will. But Old Dolio... the old Old Dolio... used up all his money at the very end on experimental cancer stuff. Mm. Okay. And your daughter is...? She doesn't know anything about tender feelings. Hi, Old Dolio. Okay, so I'm just gonna observe. Hmm. Are you feeling stressed? Hmm, no. No. Okay. Do you want to hold my hand? No? Okay. Okay. Hmm. Your hair has gotten so long. It's beautiful, hon. Can I brush it? It's just a tremor. It's okay. You're... It's okay. You're okay with me. Here, let's, uh, warm it up a little bit. Is there...? Oh, uh, there's a drain. It can drain. There's a drain under there. On the floor. In the floor. So are you gonna return it or sell it and then return it? Or what do you want? It's better with the light off. Let's take a bath. Are you surprised? Maybe you didn't know that I-I felt this way. No. I'm the least surprised I've ever been in my life. Huh. So what's the plan? You'll watch me undress, and then you'll start getting your dick hard, then I'll get in? Well? Come on. So, what were you picturing? - Soapy titties? - Sure. Yeah? Sure. Does this work? No, right? Of course it doesn't work. Why would it work? Nothing works here. Pathetic. So, titty fuck? - Oh, that got your attention. - Knock, knock. Oh. We want this to be about your pleasure, too. Oh, yeah. Well, what makes you feel good? - Uh, Melanie, uh, let's not... - Listen, uh... - Just... let's just... - We-We're, we're surprised. - Time for a snack, all right? - I think, I think... - What? - What? What are you guys doing? Why-why are there crackers on a plate? Don't go, hon. "Hon"? You just... You've never called me that. I have. I have called you that. Oh? Call me "hon," then. What is that? Hmm? What is this? "Newborn to 18 years." You can't do it. I bet you could if it was a job, though, right? $1,575 to call me "hon." Oh, three-way split. It's 525 each. I don't want to do it that way this time. It's one word. Just say it. You could just say it. I can't just say it. We... don't call you "hon" or "sweetheart" or "baby." We don't wrap up little birthday presents with ribbons. - I-I don't want... - Yes. That's what you want. And-and what else? Hmm? Want me to put you on my abdomen? Hmm? Make pancakes? And you want me to do a little dance? - No. - Yes. You want us to be false, fakey people. Hmm? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... I'll do it. I'll call you "hon" for $1,575. Keep walking. Keep walking. Keep walking. A lot of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. What's this? Uh, it's a... it's a mug warmer. A lot of the times, my mom will buy two of something and just send me one. It's Wednesday. Wednesday it leaks three times 'cause of sanitation. It's... it's really a three-person job. It's all over the floor now. They'll be calling any second. Just after they put the buckets down. Okay, uh... thank you or whatever. Um, here. This should cover that. Unless you bought it in bulk... I don't know. Y-You don't pay for... Okay. Uh... You're jonesing. What? You're addicted to them. My cousin Timothy... when he was trying to kick pills, he would be fine, and then he would have this sudden wave of needing them really bad. Well, I think this is a little different because they're my parents. In what sense? What? In what sense are they your parents? What's an example? We split everything three ways. We have since I was little. What do you spend yours on? Your third. W-We go in on everything equally. Actually, that's another example. That makes two things. Aren't you forgetting something? Hon. Oh, hon. My sweetheart. My sweet baby. There's a check cashing place across the street. Oh, so you're just gonna go...? Home. W-Wait. You thought I was gonna take this much for...? This is a full-service deal. Uh... so... "We don't call you 'hon, ' 'sweetheart' or 'baby.'" Did that. "We don't make..." Pancakes? We don't have to... You can just take it. What was that thing that she said about putting you on her abdomen? Oh, it's-it's called a breast crawl. It's not... Uh, do a little dance? I don't know why she said that. Have you ever danced? Yeah. Birthdays? Birthday presents wrapped up with a bow. Look, let's not. So when we've done these things, then I want my money and you can go. I have to get pancake stuff for the morning. The morning? They're a morning thing. There's a camera there, there and there. All Super A security systems are on a pentagram, so you have to move between the points. Basically, all the odd-numbered aisles are free goods. I'm buying this stuff, so... Yeah. It's just an... interesting fact. Is that okay? Oh. Do you want to... I have pajamas. No. I'm good. What are you doing? What do you mean? What are... Are you trying to... rile me up? How does this even work? I can't... Here's what I would do: just one big one. It's less flipping. Yeah, but l-little things are... Like, it-it's fun. You just stack them. Boop. Most happiness comes from, like, dumb things. Okay. Okay, uh, so... that's that. What's, uh... I don't... Oh, that. I could just crawl out of a dark space to do that. That's fine. So, it'll be all dark, and then I'll crawl out. The light will be blinding. And this is the abdomen. And then we're done. I know a place that's darker than this. This is fine. It'll work. It's not gonna take long. Oh, we're right by the 7. You could just drop me on the way back. This is the... Mm-hmm. Light's broken. Well, it's... it's dark, but... but this was so far. We could've been done by now. Exactly. Okay, so I guess I'll crawl out and... It's just a tremor. No. This one is... This one is building. - Whoa! - It's happening! - Out. Get out. - No! No, no, no, no. Don't touch the door or the walls. Everything is live. Just stay in the middle. - Is the doorknob... - It's metal. It's live. Don't touch it. Don't touch. It's so quiet. I don't hear anyone. It is quiet. Why is it so quiet? It's darker. It was dark before. No, it's completely black. Oh, my God. What? What? - Oh. - What? You don't want to know. We're not in life anymore. - What? - Yeah. I think it happened right away. Right after that first big noise. - It? - We died. Wh... I'm fine. I... That's what everyone always says right after. They can't believe it. You might never believe it, but this is just how it's gonna be. Forever. Just us. - In blackness. - Stop. That's not... You can't believe it because you were married to life. Hooked on it. I wasn't hooked, so it's not such a big deal to me. - It would hurt. - I don't think so. Please. Stop. I can feel my face. Yeah. That's just a memory. I don't have any regrets. You're gonna have regrets, though, because you're gonna miss sex and dancing and pancakes. I just had that one pancake, so I'm not gonna be sad. You-you looked in the mirror so many times you'll miss your face forever. But I-I don't even... I-I don't even remember my face. I can't even say what I looked like. You had long, sandy blond hair... - Shh. - ...ice blue eyes and... Stop. Shh. - Just doesn't matter. - And pure skin. You know I was just trying to rob you. No. You're such a stupid little idiot, and your brain is in your tits! The plan was for me to go, and then... and-and stake out your apartment and-and get access to your account... You guys fine? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. I was, I was driving. Everyone stopped. It was crazy. We thought we were dead. I didn't think that. I'm Old Dolio. It's wonderful to meet you. God bless you. Okay, I'm-I'm not religious, but, uh... No, I'm-I'm not, either. I've never said that before in my life. How about this? Right? You think that was the big one? Uh, I don't know. - I don't think that. - No, it was. That was it. Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh. Right. This is, this is done. Uh... I'm never gonna forget you. My whole life. This... this Subaru. I've memorized all of this. Okay, can we... You guys okay? Yes. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. Yeah, these are great structures for quakes. Since we're open 24 hours, we got to be ready for anything. Have you tried everything in this store? Nope. That's what I would do if I worked here. It's not too late. You can try everything once and then isolate your favorites and-and just eat them on a perfect day where you just eat all your favorite foods. That's what I would do if I worked here. So, do you apply? Or how does that work? Do you have to take special training or-or a class or something? Yes! Yes! Come in! Come in! I'm gonna, I'm gonna pop this. That's how you open it, right? You just... pop. Okay, that comes to 29.83. That's my money. So, no sale, actually. Uh, should I put all this back? I'm-I'm just gonna... I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna... Okay. You know, I-I didn't even... I forgot about that whole thing. Did you forget about robbing me? You forget that you wanted to rob me? Wanted to gain access to my account, remember? My brain is in my tits? No. Th-That was just, that was just a lie. Uh... Y-You don't believe me. No, I believe you. You don't. - Well, what do I do? - Okay. - What can I... - The ringer was off. - I'm fine, Mom. - You're okay. - You're okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Uh, here. - I'll... You want me to... - Oh, my God. - I'll smash my finger with this! - Are you all right? - I'll do it! - Right. That was big. I called the second I heard. - I've been calling and calling and... - Come back. - I'm sorry. - Oh, my heart is still pounding. I don't know what to do. - It was just so... - I don't know what to do. - What do I do? What do I do? - I could use a squeeze. - Squeeze, squeeze, Mama. - I don't know what to do. I'm sorry. I... What is... What is that behind you? Maybe you should... - Okay. - Okay. Thank you for waiting. Someone will be with you shortly. They never pick up, so... You don't have to do it if you don't want to. It's like, if you don't... Old Dolio? Can you hear us? Oh. We've been, we've been calling and calling and calling. That was it. It was the big one. You okay? You're not ready to talk yet. That's okay. Just leave them here. - I am. - Okay. - We're-we're going now. - Okay. Bye-bye. "Happy birthday. Our little girl is 14. Love..." Newborn. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Where's the 18th one? This is crap. You know they're just... I know it's some kind of job. They're scamming me. "Happy birthday. "Our little girl is 18. Cordially invite..." They want to take me out to dinner. Both of us. At Mélisse. It's for my 18th birthday. Is it your birthday? No. And I'm 26. Don't go, right? - I have to. - No. No, no, no. You actually... But you don't. You... Then leave the money here. Just to make sure that they don't... They think I don't know anything about a sort of fancy restaurant like that. Well, we're gonna walk in there and they're gonna be like, "Whoa. Who even are you now?" Hi. We're meeting two others. - Could be under Dyne. - Mm-hmm. They're probably gonna be late. It's three bus rides. Nope. I usually like to sit more in the back, but this table's fine. Thank you. Can I start you off with some drinks? Uh, yes. I'll have, uh... Do you still have the port? The Colheita or the tawny 20-year? Um, the, uh, the-the Colheita. I-I guess I'll... I will have the, um... um, the "Golaca..." Uh, actually, nothing. Water. Oh, isn't that the woman who gave you the massage? Oh, hi. Hi. The healing arts. That's a solid profession. People are always in pain. So, what do your parents do, Melanie? My mom works in real estate. Oh, Robert used to... I used to publish a, uh, resource guide for real estate agents. - Yeah. - With coupons. We were straight shooters back then. I mean, if we're being completely honest, we... Well, it was tough times. And, you know, the coupon book didn't really take. Well, we were reacting to the era. Uh, everybody was. Could I see the coupon book? Of course, then the culture changed, and so now we look sort of out of step. Oh, maybe it'll change back. It's returnable. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Old Dolio ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ 36 hours ago, I... Sorry. We were very angry at you. But, um, I see now that it was just a base response. It was just fear, really. Just fear. And then, after the big one happened, I... This is hard. I'm not good at this. After the... I... we got very worried. We didn't think you were dead, but if you were dead... I would have regretted not... ...doing enough things to show you... See, because, I don't know, I just... um, I just... I always thought it was insulting to treat you like a child. It just, it just always seemed so insincere. And-and I thought we agreed on that. You know? Um, but when, um... after the... the thing I just kept thinking is I just want to, I just want to hold her face. We've been very lucky to have you. Oh, God. We are very, very lucky to have you as our daughter. I'm sorry. I'm just sorry. Hey. Good night, sweet daughter. Have sweet dreams. Um, in the morning, if you want, uh... I can make pancakes. T-Tomorrow's Friday. The check. We cashed it, but we haven't spent it. Don't worry about the rent. We're the parents. We'll handle it. We've got a plan. Okay. Um, I guess I'll s... ...see you tomorrow. - Yeah. - Yep. So, if it's gone, they're monsters and this whole night was a lie. Okay? But if it's there, then this is all real. You'll believe that. Wait, wait. Um... If it's just my third, 525... ...then that means... "We can only ever be how we are. "But we love you and, um... ...we wish you well." It's all there. I'll probably take off early tomorrow before you're up. Thank you for everything. Really. No problem. Oh. So what? What? Okay, so your refund comes to 485.05.
