Be careful, please. (children giggling) - Are you really gonna go all by yourself? - I still have to do it. - [Becca] But aren't you afraid? - I'm gonna be okay. - But what if you're not back in time for- - Good morning. How you feeling today, Mia? - Fine, thanks. - Good. I was thinking of having a birthday dinner for you. 18. It's a big deal. I remember just yesterday you were a scruffy teenager arriving at my house. - Yeah. Well, thank you. But really, I don't need anything. I really don't. - Oh, come on. It's good for all the kids. You're gonna be an adult. Come on. It'll be nice. - I think I'm gonna run in to the library. - [Mrs. Rothswell] Okay. - There are some books I wanna get. - [Mrs. Rothswell] Well, get some for when you're at the hospital too, okay? - Yeah, sure. Hey, do you think I could borrow some money for buses and, you know, snacks? - Okay. - Pretty please. - Yes, yes, yes. - You're the best. - [Mrs. Rothswell] I know. - Thank you. I'll be back before lunch, Mrs. R. - Okay. - Thank you. Mwah. - Bye. - Bye. - [Mrs. Rothswell] So kids, what are we gonna do today? (somber music) (phone chimes) - [Josh] Hey man, it's been a while. Can you believe I've already been home for three weeks? I'm so bored. Come over. You can't ignore me forever. (somber music continues) - [Lisa] Morning. Cream or butter? - Thanks, Mom, but. - Right. Not hungry today either. - Hey, buddy. Ah, well, um, we talked to Josh last night. Seems like he's doing a little bit better. - He asked us about you again and we told him- - Yeah, I know. I'm gonna go see him right now. - Oh, I think he'll appreciate that. - Yeah. - Have you responded to the scholarship letter? Come on, Kyle, they are not gonna hold your place forever. - Well, then they should give it to someone else. - No, this is not- - Honey. Honey, you have the whole summer before you have to go. Sign the entrance enrollment. Then see how you feel. - I don't think I'll be back for lunch. - Hey, here, take this with you. Here you go. - I don't know what to say. - [Lisa] Why did you have to say that again? - [Connor] He can't throw away his soccer scholarship. He didn't go to graduation, fine, but bailing on his scholarship? - [Lisa] You've got to give him more time. It's only been a few months since the accident. He'll come around. - [Connor] I hope so.

So, um, where've you been? - First two editions of "Sun Eater." - (laughs) Thanks, dude. You're the best. So have you talked to them yet? Noah's parents? They've called a bunch of times. They wanna talk to us. You still can't remember? You know, what happened before the? Me neither. They say it's normal. (knuckles rapping) - I'm so sorry, boys, but the, um, physical therapist called, he's gonna be here any minute, so I think you should. - Yeah, yeah, of course, um. (clears throat) I- I'll come back later. - We haven't summoned the courage to tell him yet, but he may never walk again. It's a blessing that you didn't get more hurt than you did. Just, just look at you. There's barely a scratch on you. And Josh, he's just broken. And Noah. Noah. (sighs) There's not. There's not an hour that goes by.

(Kyle panting) - Oh, oh, ow! Oh. - Are you all right? You passed out. Are you feeling better? (Mia screaming) - Get it off me, get it off me! Gross. Ooh. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, it's, I- I'm usually not this hysterical. It's just that, um, when I was a kid, a lizard crawled into my bed once. And, you know, when you're five years old, that could be really traumatizing. - People don't scream when they're about to pass out. - No? - No. - Okay, well, I'm epileptic and so I can always tell when I'm about to faint. And because of that, I scream because I get scared. Hold on, hold on a minute. I just, I think that we should talk. - Just mind your own business. - No, no. Don't you get it? You are my business. If I let you do what I think you are about to do, I will never be able to forgive myself. And your mother would never be able to forgive me either. - Just go home. - No. - Fine. - No. If you jump, I'm gonna jump. - What the? Hey, stop. (gentle slow bright music) (Kyle grunts) - Do you believe me now? Monkey see, monkey do. - This has gotta be a nightmare. Just go away. - Never. (gasps) Ooh, it's unlocked. - Gimme my phone back. - Mm-mm. I'm gonna text myself so I have your number. - Who are you? - My name's Amelia. Amelia Faith, but you can call me Mia. Hi. - Finally. I was getting worried. - I'm so sorry. I just, I- I lost track of time at the library. - Mia, just be honest with me and you better not have your fingers crossed behind your back. - Maybe we should try another counselor. - No, come on, Lisa, it has been months and he's getting worse day after day. And he won't talk. He won't eat. I mean, he barely even looks at us anymore. Hey. - [Lisa] How'd it go with Josh? (soft somber music) - [Mia] I knew it. (phone beeping) (phone line ringing) - [Renee] Hey. If it isn't my favorite foster sis. How's Mrs. Rothswell doing? - She's good. Hey, can I ask you a favor? Can you still do your responsible mother voice? (doorbell chimes) Hi, my name is Mia. I'm a really good friend of Kyle's. - Oh. - Him and I were having a conversation the other day and he said that he's obviously going through a hard time. - Right. - And he really felt like he needed to get away. So I just thought that, um, it might make you feel better if you could speak to my mom. - Yeah. - Dammit. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, Mrs. Faith. It's just such a surprise. Thank you very much, Mrs. Faith. We'll be sure to let him know. Such an amazing offer. Oh? Yeah, he's been going through tough times. I. Ah-huh. Here he is now. - Oh. Yeah. Thanks, Mom. Okay, bye. She is so chatty. (Lisa and Mia laughing) Hey, so I was just filling your parents in on what we talked about yesterday. - Uh? - With you saying that you needed to get away. And my mom inviting you to spend some time with us in Spain. She's a photographer, a really, really good one. And so she travels a lot and she's been there for a week already and she says that we're just gonna love it. - She seems really nice. But Kyle, honey, why haven't you ever told us about Mia? - Because I just- - No, no. No, no. You're not gonna tell them how we met, are you? That is so embarrassing. (laughs) - Okay, so you're saying that you wanna travel now? - Mm-hmm, he said that he would not miss it. - Can I talk to Mia in private? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - What are you doing here? - I'm trying to get your parents on board for you to come to Spain. - Spain? - Yes. Spain. The place between France and Portugal. Come with me for 10 days. All expenses paid. Just get outta town for a little while. - Forget it. - Okay, look, your parents are very nice, but they also seem very concerned for your wellbeing. I could tell them how we actually met or you could come with me. And if you still wanna kick the bucket after the trip, I won't stop you. Deal? - Mom, Dad. Mia's leaving. - Okay, look, no, you can think about it. You don't have to decide now. You can just let me know tonight or, or maybe tomorrow. I'll be back. Well, it was really nice to meet you guys. Thank you so much. My mom, she just really wanted me to meet you guys in person. There are so many, you know, crazy people out there. She just. - Of course. - It was a pleasure to meet you. - [Mia] Really nice meeting you. - Um, hon, just to let you know, your, your shirt's on inside out. - Oh no, I do that on purpose. - Oh! - Yeah. It makes me feel like I'm a little bit less conventional, or, or something. - Oh. - Oh, wait. Hey, Kyle. Don't forget to text me a picture of your passport and all that jazz. We leave in three days. - I'm gonna kill you. - (laughs) Yay. Bye. - Why do you think he never said anything about her? She's lovely. - He hasn't told us anything in three months. (insects chirping) (knuckles rapping) - Come in. - Hey, buddy. Your mom and I just finished reading this. We thought you might get something out of it. Hey, you know what? I got an idea. What do you say that you and I take a soccer ball, hit the field, you can work on your PKs. I don't think you can score on me today. - No, I'm okay. - Okay. Plan B. There is a big FIFA match tonight. You, me, pizza. Watching it together on the couch. - Not tonight, okay? (Connor sighs) - Son, I know what you're going through is incredibly challenging, but you can't stay locked up in your room day after day, hiding. - Can we please not do this? - No, we are. We're gonna do this right now. You've been pushing us away for too long. Something has to change. Do you think that if you get outta here and you go to Spain, that that's gonna help? 'Cause if you do, I want you to go. - No, I don't wanna go. - You don't wanna go? You know what, what do you wanna do? You wanna stay in here for another three months, moping? - What do you want from me? - I want my son back. I want you. (somber music) - He's gone, Dad. - What? (sighs) Kyle. (Kyle sobs) Here. Go find him. (somber music continues) - This is for you. Looks pretty. Like you. - Do you really have to go? - Yeah. This is my chance to get some answers, Becca. I hope you can understand. Hey, come here. I have to tell you something really important. My best friend once told me, no matter what happens, no matter where I am, there will always be somebody somewhere who is glad you were born. Okay? So don't be sad. (phone rings) (gentle bright music) - Why are you smiling? - I just got some good news about my trip. - [Announcer] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the captain and crew, we would like to welcome you aboard. Our flight to Madrid, Spain will 13 hours- - I am so excited. I've been planning this trip for years and I've been thinking about it, well, forever. Have you ever had a dream and it finally comes true and then you just don't know what to feel? That is exactly what I'm feeling right now. - [Announcer] Please take a moment to review the safety data card in the seat pocket in front of you. - Hey, hey, maybe we ought to watch this. - [Announcer] To fasten your seatbelt, insert the metal fitting one into the other, tighten by pulling the loose ends of the straps. Should the cabin experience any pressure loss stay calm and listen for instructions from your cabin crew. Oxygen masks will- - Oh! Cool, thank you. - [Announcer] Place the mask over your mouth and nose. If you are traveling with children, make sure your own mask is on first before helping them. - It's my first time on an airplane. It's actually my first time outside of California. Isn't that so exciting? I've always wondered what it would be like on an airplane. How big up-ahead storage would be? I thought it would be smaller than this, actually. I was pleasantly surprised. (air gently whooshing) (Mia gasps and sighs) (gentle bright music) (bright upbeat music) - Oh, here it is. - Ah! - So you're the girl who booked the Tuc Tuc a year ago. - [Mia] Mm-hmm. - [Surfer] (chuckles) You like to plan ahead. (Mia and surfer chuckle) So I guess that's Noah? - No. No, Noah couldn't make it. - Oh, okay. - Ah. But this is Kyle. Kyle Thompson. Here is his info. - Bueno, then if you can give Noah his receipt, then I will just add Kyle to the paperwork, and yes. Okay, this is for you. Let's go see the van. - Okay. - Here it is. Fully equipped, exactly as advertised. You have a kitchen, you have a stove, uh, the bed on the back, and you also have Bluetooth connection, if you want to listen to music while you drive, it'll be perfect. And I guess that's pretty much it, so, uh, see you in 10 days. Oh, could you please take care of her for me, okay? - Mm-hmm. - You must be crazy if you think that I'm getting in this thing with you.

Didn't she talk to my parents about meeting us out here? - No, that was, uh, that was my foster sister. - What? - Yeah. Yeah. The thing is, is that I don't. I don't know my mom. She left me. Hey, but the cool thing is, is that it's my birthday. And how awesome would it be if I got to meet my mom on the day that I was born? - (clears throat) Happy birthday, Mia. - Thanks. - So where does this mom of yours live? - Well, over the last two years I've been doing a lot of research and I came up with 10 mother candidates. The first is in Segovia. - Well, looks like you'll meet her pretty soon then. We just passed a sign that says six kilometers to Segovia. - Six kilometers? No. No, why didn't you say something? No, I can't meet my mom like this. I brought my favorite shirt for her. I- I have to change. I can't believe that this is finally happening right now.

I was taking a shower and on my way back I got us some breakfast. - And you just took all your stuff with you to go take a shower? - Oh, actually, yes. You were out cold and I didn't wanna be grabbing stuff outta my bag, making noise. - Oh, so you weren't planning on leaving me and just taking off? - Of course not. Deal's a deal, right? Hey, watch the chocolate. - Thank you. Thank you for staying. (gentle upbeat music) - Ah! No, no, no. How did that happen? I spilled the hot chocolate. I'm such a klutz, I spilled it everywhere. - I'm so sorry. - What am I supposed to do? I can't show up to meet my mom like this. Oh man. I can't believe this happened. It's just this is my favorite shirt and I really wanted to wear it. - [Kyle] Hang on. I think I got an idea. - [Mia] Why you stopping? - Come on. We gotta get you some new clothes. - No, I'm fine, really, I'll figure something out. - "I'll figure something out." I'm not lending you my clothes. - I can't. Really, I'm on a very tight budget this trip. - Well, consider it a belated birthday gift. - No. No, I can't accept it. - Of course you can. Plus, my dad gave me his credit card and if he sees I'm not spending any money out here, then I dunno, he'll call the embassy or something. - No. - Okay, fine. Whatever.

What's this? - Yeah, yeah, I know you can't accept it, but it's my birthday gift to you. Happy birthday. - Oh! Thank you. (Mia giggles) What do you think? - Too big. Let's go get you new ones. - No. No, I love them. I've never had any before. - Ray-Bans? It doesn't get more classic than that. - No. Sunglasses. - Vamos? - Vamos.

(laughs) Oh. Wow. Nice moves. Too bad those kids aren't scouts. You could get a scholarship. - I had a scholarship but I didn't sign the paperwork. - Why not? - Got tricked to going into Spain with some girl trying to meet her mom. (Mia laughs) Let's get a nice lunch on me. What are those? - Just my vitamins. - Hm. You know what I don't get? - [Mia] Hmm? - How the heck you were planning on making this trip work if you don't know how to drive? - My best friend was supposed to come. He really wanted to help me find my mom, but he couldn't make it. - And you still have to tell me how you came up with this hit list of mother candidates. (Mia laughs) - Okay, so my former foster brother turned hacker helped me look into it. She's from Spain and she was a former exchange student in California. You know, he actually helped me find this. - So what, you just like searched up every woman with this name in Spain? - Yeah. And the States too. Fortunately there weren't many women with that last name. That, and then Spanish women, they actually never lose their maiden names. I just got really fed up with all the unanswered questions. Who was she? What happened to her? What's her family like? What's my family like? This is the only thing I have of hers. - [Kyle] That's really pretty. - Yeah. - And at least you have like foster siblings, right? - 24. I moved around a lot. 12 different homes in my 18 years in the system. - That's a lot of homes. - Yeah, but none of them are real homes. Not like yours. I've officially aged out of the system now anyway. But Mrs. Rothswell did say that I could stay with her until I go to college. (waiter speaking Spanish) - Gracias. - Gracias. Oh, what are you doing? I said I was gonna pay. - I just wanna see how much I owe you. - No. My treat means you don't have to pay for it. - I know that's what it means. I just- - Oh, sorry. - Um. No, it's okay. (soft somber music) Kyle! - Noah Green is your friend that was supposed to come on this trip and you didn't think to mention that fact to me? What is this? Some kind of sick joke? - No. No, he was my best friend. He set this whole trip up. - And you choose to bring me. The reason he's gone. What do you want from me? - I don't know. I recognized you at the park and when I saw you about to jump, I- I thought that I could help you. I thought that maybe we could help each other. Kyle, I am so sorry. (poignant music) We met in photography class a few summers ago. We just hit it off instantly. He bought the plane tickets. He helped me save my money. He even found the van. - We were in the, uh, the same grade growing up. I remember playing freeze tag. And in first grade we were on the same soccer team, but, um, he stopped playing. And then, uh, we, we'd see each other in the halls and, and nod, and that was it. I wish I had known him better. - He was a one of a kind human. (solemn music) This says that the sand dunes are unmissable and that there's gonna be a meteor shower tonight. (siren wailing) (car doors thud) (officer speaking Spanish) - (speaks Spanish) English? - American? - Si, American. (officer speaks Spanish) - License and registration. - Oh yes. Yes. - Do you know why I pulled you over? You were driving too slow. Too slow. First time, warning. Second time, fine. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay, okay. - Ola. (upbeat music) (Mia laughing) You have to be the only person under 80 to be stopped for driving too slow. (laughs) Let's go, gramps. Vamos! (waves crashing) (Mia sighs) Can you smell it? I've died and gone to Venus. - You're certainly from out of this world, so makes a lot of sense. - (chuckles) Let's get in the water. - Are you nuts? In your clothes? - Oh, come on!

Death sucks. - It was an accident. (somber music) (somber music continues) - I lost control of the car. It was me. I was the one that was behind the wheel.

My friend Josh, I don't know if he'll ever walk again. Who can live with that? Not me. - Kyle, there has to be a reason that you made it out okay when the others didn't. This world, it can be really harsh and really bad things can happen, but you cannot give up because you made a mistake. You've been given a second chance to make a difference in this world. It's all in how you look at it. I could be really upset that my mom left me. Or I could just be happy that she even had me. - I wish I never existed. - Hey.

It happens with people in her condition. We are discharging her now. - Wait, wait, what condition? - Oh, I thought. Well, in that case it's better if she tells you herself. - Hey. Hey, are you okay? What condition was that doctor talking about, Mia? - I'm fine. Just forgot to take my pill. - Yeah, your vitamins. When are you gonna tell me what's actually going on? - Okay, what's going on is that I have a genetic heart defect. There. Boom. So it's fine. I'm releasing you from our agreement. - No, no, I'm, I'm not gonna just up and leave you. We had a deal, right? It's fine. I'm used to it by now. - No, Mia! You have an awesome chauffeur for the next couple of days, so come on. (gentle music) - Mrs. Rothswell? There's something I have to tell you. (gentle bright music) (phone chimes) (phone ringing) - Okay. Who are you avoiding? - My foster mom. - [Kyle] Why? - [Mia] I kind of ran away. In that I didn't tell her where I was going. - Why not? - Because Mrs. Rothswell wanted me to stay home and have the surgery. - Wait, hold on. What surgery? - I had an operation scheduled for this week. - You decided to travel to Spain instead? - My doctor said it was perfectly safe for me to travel. And what's the point of waiting my entire life just to die on an operating table before I get to meet my mom? - How dangerous is the surgery? - Half of the people die, but half of them live. - Are you, uh, are you scared? - Death has never really scared me. - Then what are you afraid of, Mia Faith? - I guess what I'm afraid of is dying invisible. If you don't make a difference in somebody's life, if you don't even try to change the world, then what's the point of ever being born? Of ever living? - Hence your Photolog. - Yeah, I guess. - Okay, so how many views? - No idea. - Seriously? - Yeah. - Gimme your phone. (Mia laughs) - Okay. - Hm, oh. No wonder here. Your account was on private. Why didn't you tell me about your heart? - I guess I just, I wanted to see what it would feel like to be a normal girl for once. ♪ I've been searching ♪ ♪ For a long time, honey ♪ ♪ Haven't learned a thing ♪ ♪ I've been searching ♪ ♪ For a long time, honey ♪ ♪ Haven't learned a thing ♪ - Hold that pose. - You're seriously taking pictures right now? - Come on, we've got moms to meet.

Um, you know, you're, you and your mom are probably gonna have a, a lot to talk about. So in case I don't get another chance to tell you, I just. - Wait, um. Let's just enjoy this moment. (gentle bright music) Wait, hi! Hi! - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Hi. Hi! - Si? - Maria Astilleros? (Maria speaking Spanish) - I'm sorry to bother you. Do you speak English? - A little rusty. I haven't really practiced since I was an exchange student in the USA a long time ago in New York. - Wait, did you say, um, New York? Oh, I, we were looking for somebody, but, um, but we were wrong. I'm sorry. - [Kyle] Excuse us. Thank you so much. We're looking for someone else. Sorry. - Okay. - It's not her. - Mia. - Kyle, I, I just need some space. - But. (somber music) (church bells ringing) (phone beeping) (phone line ringing) - [Mia] Mia's phone. Please leave a message after the beep. - Mia, where are you? I've been waiting a long time. Please answer. (poignant music) Have you guys, um, seen, uh, blonde hair, uh, uh. (gentle dramatic music) - Mia's phone. Please leave a message after the beep. (gentle bright music) (church bells ringing) The next campsite is two hours away. - I got a better idea. - [Receptionist] Let me check if there are any available rooms. - Mia, look. - It's beautiful. - You are in luck. We just had a cancellation. It's a room with a king size bed. - Okay. Whoa! (laughing) Kyle, this is crazy nice. Wow. It's so beautiful. This room is amazing! This is so cool. This is bigger than my whole house. This is so nice. What's up here? (gasps) Oh my God. (squeaks) It has a claw-foot tub. I love claw-foot tu. (gasps) Oh, and a nice cozy robe. Oh, that's so nice. Hey, do you mind if I take a bath before dinner? - No, of course not. I'll go call my parents and get us a table. - Okay. (somber music) Hi, Mrs. Rothswell. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Yeah, Yeah, I'm fine. No. No, I- I haven't found her yet. Yeah. Yeah, it's still ticking. (somber music) (gentle bright music) (insects chirping) Sorry, I dozed off. - All too much excitement for one day, I guess. Nice dress by the way. - Thank you. - I- I- I wasn't sure what you wanted, so. - Thanks. - So, uh, listen, uh, before we go home tomorrow, maybe we could do some site-seeing, go to a nice restaurant- - Home? No, I can't go home. I have to keep looking. - For what? I mean, we found all the names on the list. - Yeah, yeah, but maybe I made a mistake or something. - You can't be serious? Mia, listen, you have to go home. You need this operation. This isn't some kinda game. - I know, but I have to keep looking. - You can't keep putting your life on the line looking for someone who, who might not wanna be found. You've done your best, Mia. I'm sorry. - I know. You're right. But I just wanna look her in the eyes and I wanna ask her why she didn't keep me. Ask her how she could just abandon me and act like I never even existed. - Well, maybe she did it because it was best for you. Maybe she thought that you were better off with someone else. - You don't understand. - No, you don't understand. You know, maybe if you stopped obsessing over some woman who did nothing but give birth to you, you'd actually start turning your attention to the people who really care about you. - Kyle. (sighs) (somber music) (somber music continues) I might be wrong, but I need to see this through. Just gimme three days and if I don't find her, I will go home and have the surgery. I promise. (solemn music) - Three days, Mia. No more. - And if anything goes wrong. - Hey. - If anything goes wrong, I'll see you on Venus. (romantic music) (solemn music) (solemn music continues) Good morning. - [Kyle] Morning. - Sorry, I didn't hear you get up. - Oh no, I didn't wanna wake you up. Hey, so I've been thinking a lot about your mother. And Mia, look at your mom's signature. What does it say? - It says Maria Astilleros. - Or what if it said Maria Ostilleros? Look, what if the A was actually like an O and they just mistyped it? Oh, then I want you to look at this. Open it. (soft bright music) - It's the same as my necklace. - It's from that small town. And I looked it up and there's a lot of Maria Ostilleros', but there's only one that lives near there. - (exhales sharply) Oh my God. - And I just found an address. (upbeat music) You know, we still have two more hours to go. Why don't you get some sleep? If I see anything really interesting, I'll wake you up. All right? (upbeat music) (singer vocalizing) Hey, you gotta see this. Hey. Hey, Mia. Mia. Mia? Hey, Mia? Mia! (gentle dramatic music) Can I please get an update on Amelia Faith? - Excuse me? Are you Amelia's friend? - Yeah. Is she okay? - She's stable for now. However, her heart is very weak. I understand she's scared of undergoing the surgery, but if she doesn't, she'll die. - How, how long do you think she can hold out for? She's supposed to get the surgery when we get home. - She could last a month, a week. We just don't know. But definitely she can't fly in her condition. - Can I see her? - I need you to convince her to let us do the surgery. - Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course. - [Doctor] Could you take her ID to the nurse so they can fill out the paperwork? - Yeah. (somber music) (poignant music) (machine beeping) - [Mia] Kyle? Please, you have to help me. - Why is your ticket only one-way? You never intended on having that surgery, did you? What was your plan, exactly? You just keep going until you find her? Waste away until you do. If you do. - No. Kyle. - No. Tell me it isn't true. Please tell me you're gonna have that surgery. Dammit, Mia. You'd rather just give up than risk what, exactly? Having someone love you? Or loving someone yourself? - You don't understand. My heart has an expiration date. - Then explain that to me. - I don't want them to open my heart until I get to meet my mom. - What about me? What about us? - That is not fair. I shouldn't have to choose one of you. - I- I can't do this. - Kyle! (somber music) (siren wailing) (gentle dramatic music) (siren wailing) (intense dramatic music) - [Kyle] Help! Help, help! (Josh and Kyle laughing) - Bro, check this. - Bro, chill, I'm driving. - [Josh] Funniest things I've seen in- - [Kyle] I'm being serious. - Just look at it. - No, chill. Oh! (tires squealing) (metal crashing) (glass shattering) (intense dramatic music) (Kyle panting) (phone beeping) (phone line ringing) (phone buzzing) - [Josh] Hey. - It's all coming back. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I couldn't bring myself to tell you, but it was me. It was my phone. I was totally wasted and I showed you that video. - And, and I looked at it. And, and I tried to get around that motorcycle. It was an accident. (solemn music) So you just gotta learn from it. And, and forgive yourself. - I'm sorry, Kyle. - Yeah, me too, Josh. (solemn music) (Josh sobbing) (phone line beeping) Mia! - Kyle. - I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry too. - I can't even begin to imagine. But I wanna be by your side, and I don't care if, if it's for an hour or, or for years. It don't matter. As long as I'm with you. I'm gonna take you to meet your mom. - Really? (sobs) Aw. I just need a couple of hours. - But I need you to promise me something. I need you to promise me that you'll fight. That we'll, we'll come back and you'll have the operation and you'll do everything you can to get through this for us. (somber music) - Okay. (laughs) Okay. - Thank you. - I love you. - I love you too. (gentle bright music) (Mia laughs) (gentle bright music continues) (elevator pings) (Mia laughing) (gentle bright music continues) (gentle music) (dramatic upbeat music) (gentle poignant music) (Mia sighs) (birds chirping) (somber music) (doorbell chiming) - Ola? - Hi. - Hi. Can I help you? - Yeah, I came all the way from the United States because I'm looking for my mom and I was wondering if maybe you recognize this. (solemn music) (sobbing) Ola, Mama. - (sobbing) Amelia. (rousing gentle dramatic music) - Right, one more thing, then we'll head back. - It's amazing. - If things didn't work out with your mom, this was my backup plan. (camera shutter clicks) (gentle music) - I waited for that moment for so long and I had so many questions, but when I got to that door today, none of it mattered. All I could think about was you. - Oh, and one more thing. ♪ She ain't got no money ♪ ♪ Her clothes are kinda funny ♪ ♪ Her hair is kinda wild ♪ - (laughs) My song? ♪ Oh, but love grows ♪ - May I have this dance? - Yes, you may. ♪ And nobody knows like me ♪ ♪ She talks kinda lazy ♪ ♪ People say she's crazy ♪ ♪ And her life's a mystery ♪ ♪ Oh but love grows ♪ ♪ Where my Rosemary goes ♪ ♪ And nobody knows like ♪ - I'm scared. - I'll be right by your side, Mia. - This is all your fault. ♪ A feeling that's fine ♪ ♪ And I just gotta say ♪ - I was never afraid to die before I met you.

(machine beeping) (dramatic music) (lights crashing) (dramatic music continues) (heartbeat thudding) (dramatic foreboding music) (tone beeping) (Kyle sobbing) (somber music) (birds chirping) Some people change your life forever. Some people make you strive to be a better person. Some people help you find yourself right when you're ready to give up. Some people aren't invisible. Now, someone special once told me there will always be somebody somewhere who is happy that you were born. (somber music continues) Well, this is it. - Oh! Please, uh, be careful driving. Are you sure it's safe? - Yes, it's not like this is my first road trip, Mom. - I am proud of you son. You take care of yourself. - [Kyle] Yeah. - Okay. Get outta here. You only got two weeks to get to Boston, so. (somber music) (birds chirping) You sure you can drive this thing? It's harder than it looks. - I had a pretty good teacher.
