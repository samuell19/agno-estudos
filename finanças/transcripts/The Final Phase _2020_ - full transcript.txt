BASED ON ACTUAL INVESTIGATIONS How long have you been studying this kind of phenomenon? Twenty years... maybe more. How did you manage, through all this years, to balance your personal life with your work? I assume you have a wife and a family. Don't assume. I don't. Can you assure me that the video is authentic? It is. Professor Rocha, tell us everything you know. Of course. Tell me, Miss... Do you believe we're alone in the universe? THE FINAL PHASE Hi daughter, I need to speak to you urgently. Please call me. - What a day, uh? - Yes, love. - But the new hotel project is ours. - Yeah. - Back pain? - A strong one. No, wait, wait... Just leave it. Relax... - Just relax. You're all knotted up. - Yeah. You can do that later. It feels so good. I'm all better now. How about... we take a bath together... followed by more massages? I like the idea. And I like you. So, so much. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm just tired. I'll be waiting, okay? - I'll get everything ready. - Sure. I'll go in a sec. You're sweet. Hi daughter, I need to speak to you urgently. Please call me. Hello? Who is it? Can I speak to Gonzalo? Laura Pereira? Yes. Who is it? Sorry for the delay. I was at your father's house. What happened? Why can't we go there? The place was completely messed up. It seems somebody broke in looking for something. Right now, the forensic police is examining the whole place. So we'd rather not have any disturbances in our investigations. What do you know, detective? Not much for now. A neighbor heard some noises coming from the house and called us. When we got there, we found all this. Did the neighbor saw something? She saw a man. He was lurking around the house, but... that's all. Do you think he was kidnapped? We're not ruling out any possibility. Your father's an architect, right? Yeah. Like me. Do you know if he was working on any special project? No, he retired some years ago. He walked away from everything related to his profession. And... was he into any hobby, activity, anything he liked doing? He investigated certain kind of phenomenon. What phenomenon? - UFOs. - UFOs? Why was he so interested in UFOs? It's a long story. - How's your relationship with him? - We grew apart. May I ask why? He changed a lot after my mom's death, so I just decided to keep some distance. I see. And how would you describe your father's mental state? I don't know. Do you think he could have faked his own disappearance? It wouldn't surprise me. When are we going to know something? I'll get in touch with you as soon as I know anything. Rest assure... we're doing our utmost to find him. I'll give you my card. If you need anything, call me. Thank you, detective. This seems to be endless. Relax. It's just another one of Gonzalo's lunacies. Yeah, but when is he going to stop? I thought I'd be free of all this when I distanced myself. See, it's impossible. People don't change. You should know him by now. Precisely. When everything is perfect, he shows up and ruins it. Everything's gonna be okay. Relax. Dad? They're watching us. They're always watching us. Who? They... are waiting. Waiting for what? The messenger... They're coming. Whoever broke in, didn't leave any trace or fingerprint. What do you think happened to him? Judging by the circumstances, if this is a kidnapping, we're dealing with a professional. However, if that's the case, we're waiting for them to contact us, and you, to know what their intentions are. We'll keep investigating, but keep in mind this can take some time. I see. Laura... any information you can give me, would be really helpful for the investigation. I know, it's just... my father became a total stranger to me. I feel I don't know him at all. Everything's gonna be okay. Rest assure, it's gonna be okay. We'll find him. They were looking for something. What was your dad up to? I don't know. But whoever was here, went to his house too. - What they were looking for? - I don't know. We're missing something, Daniel. Laura... We should get out of here now. Let's call the detective, he'll know what to do. Yeah. Let's do that. What do you think they were looking for in the office? I don't know. Nobody had been there for a long time. You saw it. There were just blueprints, mockups... Whatever they were looking for, I don't think they found it. What do you mean? I feel this is just the beginning. Lau... Do you think your father was involved in something strange? What do you mean? I don't know, you haven't seen him for ages. Precisely. I just hope he's okay. I'm sure he is. Hello? Hello! - Who is this? - Hello, Laura Pereira? Yes. Who are you? My name is Francisco Rocha. We need to talk. I have news about your father. I need you to come to my place. - Did he say who he is? - No. Just his name. I was waiting for you. I'm glad you came. I didn't think you would. Professor Rocha, you said you had news about my father. Yeah, but call me Francisco. Have a seat, please. Thank you. How did you get my number? Gonzalo gave it to me. Gonzalo? What do you know about my father? Well, he disappeared without a trace. Yes. How do you know that? The police called me to see if I had any information. All I could tell them was that I've known him for years. Have you heard from him? The police didn't find any clue. We have no idea where he is. They thought it may be a kidnapping, but since nobody asked for ransom, they're ruling that out. I wouldn't rule that out. Do you think it was an abduction? I do. But not the kind of abduction you think. What do you mean? I don't know if you're aware that your father was studying certain... unusual phenomena. He was obsessed with UFOs, what does that have to do with it? He came to see me a few days before his disappearance. Why? Who are you? You know, now that I look at you... you study this kind of phenomena, right? That's right. I'm an ufologist. I read an article about you a while ago. What you guys study is really science fiction. Who are you? Daniel Britos. I'm Laura's partner. Laura, your father told me he'd been studying this things, and that in recent months, he'd been making telepathic contacts with entities from outside this world. Let me get this straight. You're saying that we're here... because Gonzalo made contact with aliens? That's right. - Professor Rocha... - Francisco. Let's just... - Would you like some tea or coffee? - No thank you, Francisco. I don't have coffee. - Francisco... - Yeah? If you knew my father, you must know he's not well. Since my mom passed away, his mind deteriorated. Do you think he's crazy? We think this is going nowhere. Your father told me he feared something could happen to him. And he asked me to contact you if that was the case. Me? Why? Because he sensed someone was following him to obtain the information he was receiving. - From aliens? - That's right. You need to understand this... The world we live in is quite different... from the real world. What do you mean? You know what I mean, even if you deny it. But there's only one undeniable truth in this world. What truth? We are not alone. Laura, judging by the way your father disappeared, I think we're dealing with an alien abduction. An alien abduction? Yes. It's much more common than you think. Cases like these are reported everyday around the world, Cases like these are reported everyday around the world, but they're silenced by the governments. But they're silenced by the governments. You're not making any sense. Francisco... I understand this is your specialty. I really do. But you can't expect us to believe this is what happened to my father. You can just leave and wait for a more rational answer to show up, but I assure you, it won't. No... Let's suppose for a second your theory is correct. Why did they do it? I don't know. Your father was afraid someone would steal the information he was receiving. It's also possible that whoever abducted him was trying to protect him from this threat. This will change everything. What do you think would happen if we can prove the existence of beings from another planet, of higher intelligence and a much deeper spirituality? Wait. You're talking as if there was many different species of aliens. That's right, my dear. There are thought to be 57 different species. Maybe much more. Some of them want to experiment with us, and others just want us to reach their level... - like they've done before. - Before? That's right. They have been among us since the beginning of our existence. How can you prove all this? Think about the civilizations. The Egyptians, the Mayans, the Aztecs. Think how similar they are... in knowledge and in architecture. That's all very questionable. Are you familiar with the Book of Enoc? Yeah, it's an apocryphal text from the Bible. - How's that related? - Perfect. It mentions space beings coming down to Earth and meeting Enoc. He describes them as very large beings. He also mentions that he was taken to a floating palace, where these beings spoke to him about the universe and its secrets. Many believe these descriptions... refer to angels. But they don't. If you dig deeper into the text, you can clearly see that he's talking about another kind of visitors. The thing is, Francisco, this is just your interpretation. And many others'. Think about the Nazca Lines. Huge drawings that you can only see from the sky. Who were they made for? They... They've been among us since forever. And they've selected... what information to give us... and what to hide from us. This is stupid. It's real, whether you believe it or not. What scientific evidence do you have? If you want a scientific answer... there is none. I think that's enough. We shouldn't have come here. Professor Rocha... I appreciate your intention to help us. But I suffered enough from my father's delusions. Have a good day. I know how this sounds. You must think your father was crazy and delusional. It's okay. Laura, you want to find your father and I want to help you. Just this once... I'm asking you to believe the opposite. Hello? Thank you, detective, we'll be right there. What did he say? They found him in a park. He's okay. Thank God. Did he say anything else? He was raving about aliens. Francisco... If you want us to believe you, now's the time. Would you come with us? Of course, Laura. That was fast. Where's Laura? Where's Gonzalo? He's in a room, alone. A doctor saw him. He's okay, but he won't stop raving. Take me with him. Let's go. Gonzalo... Your son-in-law's here to pick you up. Leave me alone with him. Of course. I'll be back in 15. Where's my father? Where is he? - He was with you. - Not with me. Motherfucker... It's impossible. - Where is he? - He was here a minute ago. Where is he? The parking lot. Follow me. What's going on here? Stop! - This is impossible! - Get away from him! Get away from him right now! Now freeze! I said freeze! He won't stop, detective! We must get out of here. Right now. Dad, are you okay? No, wait. Nobody leaves. There's a dead person, and I want to know what's going on. You won't understand, believe me. Please, detective. Let's go. Thank you. It's alright. We got you. Gonzalo... Help me, brother... Gonzalo... What have they done to you, man? Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Francisco... What's next? Your father hasn't said a word yet. We have to wait for him to come out of shock to know more. The information is there. It's there. I know it's there somewhere. He's deeply connected with them. Very deeply. - How do you know? - It's obvious. It happened when mom died. He got obsessed with all this. Maybe he needed it to forget, right? In cases like these... it's possible you start questioning... your own existence... the meaning of life... Yeah. He changed completely after that. He became bad tempered, stubborn... - He forgot my existence. - Don't say that. Laura... Yeah. He only cared about what's beyond our planet. I'm sorry to hear that. Okay. I should be going. Tomorrow's gonna be a very long day. Okay. - Okay. - Francisco... Thank you. For everything. Please. Francisco... why don't you stay here with us tonight? I don't want you to run into one of them. - Stay. - Okay. Thank you. - Still nothing? - Yeah. Let him sleep on the bed. I won't sleep. Me neither, honey. POLICE STATION POLICE How's Gonzalo? He just fell asleep. Listen. Do you believe all those things Francisco said? I don't know what to believe, but... what we saw was real. That guy looked exactly like me. He was identical. This is madness. Just like dad's. It's worst. Thanks for being here with me in this moment. Where else would I be? What is it? Dad, are you okay? Better than ever. Gonzalo... Would you like to see a doctor? No. No doctors. Thanks, Francisco. For what? For being there for my daughter, and for trusting me still. - Please. You don't need to thank me. - I do. - No. - I do. You know it's an honour for me. Tell me, Gonzalo... What happened? I don't know. I don't remember anything. I feel like those memories were wiped off. Losing memories and the sense of time... is very common in alien abductions. Tell me Gonzalo, what did they say to you? That... I was the chosen one. That they had a message for me, but it wasn't the right time yet. I don't know, it was very strange. No matter where I was... they were inside me, in my head, all the time. - The chosen one. - Yeah. Tell me Gonzalo, had you been abducted by aliens before? No. It was my first time. And if it wasn't for them, I would've been killed. They saved me, Francisco. Not just that. I think they also gave you the message. Why can't I remember? I think it's in your subconsciousness. It feels weird to be talking about this in front of you. I'm so glad. Excuse me. I'd like to ask you a few questions, Gonzalo. Of course. What do you feel inside? It's... strange, it's like... Like what? Like I knew something. - But you don't know what. - Exactly. I have an idea that may work. What? I would like to try hypnosis. What do you think? Would that work? I don't know, but I think the chances are good. - If you're okay with it. - Sure. Yeah, let's do it. Good. I want you to lay down in the couch, close your eyes... there. I want you to relax... every muscle in your body. With every breath... you'll feel relaxed... more peaceful... Breathe... On the count of five, you'll be at your house... on the night they visited you... It will be alright. You're peaceful. Five, four... three, two... one... What's going on, Gonzalo? I'm coming home. I feel like something's chasing me. I get inside and close the door. I call my daughter. She's not home. They try to break in. They want to get in. They're doing it. I see through the window, I see... I see through the window, I see... What do you see, Gonzalo? I see a light... A blinding light... What happens now? I'm in a familiar place. I'm not alone. Oh God... What's happening, Gonzalo? One of them is right beside me. What's he like? It's very tall. Strange skin... He doesn't want to hurt me. What does he want? To communicate. How? Telepathically. He wants to give me a message. What message? From the constellation of Sah... Enki and their descendents will return... We must prepare for the final phase... I want you to come back to me. In five, four, three, two, one... Dad, are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah. What happened? Did it work? You were abducted to receive a message. What message? That we should prepare for the final phase, Gonzalo. - I can't believe it. - What's going on? What's the final phase? Their way of contact. The final way. We will be together again, like in ancient times. And when's that gonna happen? I think that information... still remains in Gonzalo's subconsciousness. They will decide when will we know. In the message, dad said... that Enki and their descendents would return. Who's Enki? Anunnaki. What's Anunnaki? What are you talking about? Enki... also known as the Lord of Earth, is a god from the Sumerian mythology. But Enki isn't a god. He's an alien creature from the civilization know as the Anunnakis. How's that related to us? Why did he say they would return? Because the Anunnakis created the human race. They've been among us since the beginning of our existence, Laura. What? Many civilizations point out... that we were created genetically by space beings. And many specialists agree with this theory. Many years ago, they found clay tablets from the Sumerian people. As they translated them... they found amazing... revelations. They revealed that the human race was created by the Anunnakis. Furthermore... they provided the Sumerians with knowledge... of science... of astronomy... thus making them the first advanced civilization... of human kind. Some believe the Anunnakis remained with us in the course of our existence. That's impossible. Science knows well where we came from. Nobody could debunk Darwin, not even the Church. This can't be true. Science has its story, and religion has another one. They both have plotholes in their versions. Darwin's evolution theory doesn't really explain the evolutionary leap from Homo Erectus to Homo Sapiens. And this explains it? Maybe. These beings' genetic experimentation could explain how the monkey evolved to be human. Putting an end to the endless search for that missing link they never found. If this is true... it will change our entire existence. I know. The message mentioned the constellation of Sah. What's that about? Sah's an Egyptian god. And the constellation that represents him is Orion. Several studies mention... that the Egyptians and the Mayans... knew where these space beings came from, which they clearly showed in their constructions. No. I know those constructions very well. How did they clearly showed it? The Pyramids of Giza are perfectly aligned with Orion. If you draw an imaginary line towards the sky... you'll see the alignment is flawless. But they're not the only ones. The Mayans had their own pyramids, in Teotihuac♪n, a sacred place for them. They're also precisely aligned with Orion. So that's where they came from? There are a lot of theories of where the Anunnakis came from. Some people say they came from a gigantic planet... called Planet X, which every 3.600 years enters our Solar System, causing disasters. Others believe the home of the Anunnakis is the constellation of the Pleiades, but some of us think they found other places to inhabit. That's a different matter. What are we going to do? I don't know yet. I wanna go home. I need my computer, actually. I need more information. I'll give you a ride. I'll go too. I don't think we should separate. Don't worry, we'll be okay. Come with me. - Do you realize how dangerous this is? - Relax. - What about your father? - Stay here and look after him. - Laura, we should get going. - Yeah, in a sec. - Francisco... - Yeah? Do you really think my dad knows when the final phase's gonna be? The increase of sightings we've been having in recent times shows us they want to contact us more than ever. Your father was chosen, along with others, to receive this information and pass it on to the others. What's going to happen when they come? Nobody knows. Some believe it could be the end of the world. Others think they'll start a new era of peace and spirituality for everyone. What do you think? I think we're on the verge of a new evolutionary leap. Like thousands of years ago. Do you think that Enki will return? If the Anunnakis are coming, he'd better return. According to the Sumerian mythology, Enki advocated for the human race. Wait. According to the Sumerian tablets, the Anunnakis created us to be their slaves. Slaves? Yes, that's right. Initially. See, Enki was a geneticist, and he took part in the human creation. He didn't think of us as slaves. He believed the human race deserved to have a chance, to be free. Unfortunately, Enlil didn't. Who's Enlil? His brother, with whom he always had a power struggle about this planet. And where is he now? Remember when I said some Anunnakis found other places to inhabit? - Yeah. - We believe this planet is hollow, and that several alien species live inside it, all ruled by Enlil. So we don't even own our planet? Something like that. We're living a lie. Hello? - Hello? - What is it? I don't know, it happened before. I only hear static. He intercepted us. He knows where we are. - Who? - The creature you were talking to. - What do we do? - We must go. He knows where we are. Hurry. What took you so long? Daniel, they're following us. We're in danger. Wait. I have an idea. Who are you calling? Who are you calling, Daniel? - The detective. - The detective's dead by now! Whoever answers, it's not him! Hello? I know a safe place we can go to. Tell me, is that place safe for us? I want you to stay here. It's too dangerous. What are you saying? I'll go with you. No. Why not? I have to do this alone. - I won't leave you now. - Daniel... I need it. I have to know what's going on. This could be very dangerous. Please be careful. I'll be okay. I just need to clear things up with dad. To put an end to all this. Please understand. Okay. It's been long since the last time I was here. I didn't know about this place. You were going to know eventually. When I'm here, I feel like... your mother's here with me. I feel it too, dad. I'm sorry, daughter. I'm sorry for all the pain that I caused you. For everything I made you go through. I'm sorry. - It was really hard. - I know. I know. Why did you push me away? - I wasn't in my right mind. - And how do you think I was? I lost mom... then I lost you. I was left alone. I needed you. Believe me, if I could turn back time, I would. But you can't. No... You can't. I got really scared when you disappeared. I thought I wouldn't see you again. It's over, it's over... It's over. I was lost for a very long time, but it's over. Things have fallen into place now. I'm so proud of you. You're the most important thing in my life. I don't want to lose you again, dad. Can you promise me I won't? Can you? What should we do now? We must hide... and wait. Wait for what? For the information in your father to manifest itself. - Who is it? - Open the door. It's me. What are you doing here? I wasn't expecting you tonight. I changed my mind. Is everything okay? Yes. I wanted to talk to you. About what? Your father... where is he? That's what I want to know. Who are you? Where's Gonzalo? I won't tell you. I don't need you to tell me. God... I'm ready for whatever you planned for me. Laura? Francisco... I can't find dad anywhere, what time is it? - Ten o'clock. - It's been an hour. He should be here by now. - Do you think something happened to him? - I don't know. - Let's go find him. - Yeah. I know that place. Dad! Enki... I was waiting for you. There's nothing you can do for them. You will never defeat Enlil. Enlil... is next. Dad... Dad... everything will be alright. I'll go get some help and you will recover. It doesn't have to be this way, daughter. What are you saying? My time is over. I did what I had to do. What was that? To tell you... that I love you. I love you too, dad. Don't leave me alone again. You'll never be alone. I know that now. Your mother's waiting for me. No, no, no! No! No... No, dad... No! ONE MONTH LATER How's Laura? You know, it's hard. She returned to work. But Gonzalo's death... was very painful to us all. Yes, I can imagine. What's up with you? I... don't mean to sound insensitive... It's okay. Go ahead. But I think there's more to know. Much more. About the final phase? Yeah. When I hypnotized him, there were holes. What holes? He mentioned that on the night he was abducted, he was in... a familiar place. What does it mean? That he was comfortable. What do you think? I think he... he came to leave something for us. I don't know if he was supposed to tell us what it was, but... But what, Francisco? Please. ...he was supposed to tell us where it is. What about the country house? The house... Hi Lau. Hi honey, I'm about to enter a meeting. What's up? No, I can't put it off. What is it? I'm on my way. Well... Let's start looking. Any luck? Nothing. Maybe I was wrong. I had a feeling that there was something here. I found something. - What is it? - I don't know. Are you ready? Yes. Hi daughter, I hope you're watching this. We're not alone. We never were. The world as we know it will change dramatically. The truth will be revealed soon. A truth that will change all our paradigms. That's why I want to prepare you for that moment. In the next video... I will explain that truth. And I will probably not be alive by then. So you'll have to decide whether to make it public or not. I trust you'll do the right thing. I love you. I've always loved you. Today, April 12... I'm making this video for anyone who wants to hear it. I've been studying the UFO phenomenon for several years. And six months ago, I made contact with an alien species, called the Anunnakis. They contacted me to pass a message. The message is that... the day of the final encounter is coming. Very soon. They will return in a year from now. They will be present and made contact with us once again. They want us to be ready for that moment, and... to know the entire truth. And that truth is that they created us. There are many interests against making public this truth, from people who provoke wars, who seek their own destruction, but they will protect us. I know... some people will think this video... is strange, is a surprise. I'm asking them... to believe. Believe what I'm saying. I waited all my life to hear this. Now we know that they'll be here in a year. The whole world will be shocked. We're not ready for this. I know. But they have to know. Francisco... Are you going to make it public? Daniel... this goes against everything we know. The world will change. We can't hide this information. Yes. I think so too. But if we do this, we'll be targeted. I know. But we must prepare people for what's coming. Besides, once we spread the news, no one can hide the truth. What if they don't believe us? Sooner or later, they will. That's the story. Hard to believe? Our world is too. New things are discovered everyday in our planet. Species that we believed extinct... reappear. Natural wonders that amaze us... that thrill us. Multiply... triple all that... in the immensity of the universe. How much more there is to learn? Surely a lot. And I don't know if you heard this, but... there has been many reports of sightings these last few days in different parts of the world. Do you think that's related, or is it just a coincidence? No, it's no coincidence at all. This will increasingly get bigger until the final phase day. The final phase, which will take place in... I'm sorry, it's just... so hard to say it. In a year? Exactly. Actually... no one's ready yet. When they arrive, it will be up to us... to make it a great day for humanity. They're waiting for us to decide... what kind of world do we want. And fundamentally, if we're willing to share it. What do you think? I don't know. I can't answer that. I would like to, but I can't. Thank you so much, professor Rocha, for being here with us tonight. It was a real pleasure to have you here. Any final message you want to give? When the day comes... don't be afraid. That was the day everybody's lives changed. As for me, I'm continuing what my father couldn't finish. Enki... I'm ready. What's next? THE FINAL PHASE PART ONE
