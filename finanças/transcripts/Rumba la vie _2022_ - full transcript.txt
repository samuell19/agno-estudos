Bye. Bye. Bye. So long, Tony. Bye. See you tonight, Tony. Until the evening. Bye, buddy. Come on, children, see you tonight. Zoe, your shoelace. Nonsense. So long, Tony. Portfolio, Sidonie. Carefully. Hello. Written by FRANK DUBOSC Kevin come on, get out. If you don't want to go to school, go straight to labor exchange. That's how you save time. But being unemployed isn't great at all. And the canteen has French fries. I don't like fries. Kevin! Producer SIDONY DUMA A film by FRANK DUBOSCQ In the morning I did not find you, I overslept a little. The manager buzzed his ears. Okay, they are small. What a beautiful! Beautiful but broken. How was your weekend? Complete rubbish. On the sports channel they played only figure skating. Figure skating is beautiful. For me, war films are better. At least they're not babes. Ooh… womanish. Veronica! Some couples are fine. Okay you. They ride together, but you can't force me to believe they are a couple! They obviously don't sleep together. Are these guys men? Maybe this their girlfriends or sisters. But they are definitely not a couple. It's beautiful, artistic. Well, yes. Artistic. There was a party on the 12th for Johnny. Very dramatic. But I prefer Dani Briand over Johnny. And it's not about the songs, but about the teeth. Dani has beautiful teeth and clean hair. Also, he's a nice guy. I have libido problems. The desire is there, but the work is not going. The dog barks but does not bite. What do you think? I think the problem is age. Actually, it's none of my business. And don't compare yourself to a dog. A game of ping-pong? Can. Monsieur Quentin. Monsieur Quentin. Whoo! Monsieur Quentin. Monsieur Quentin. I'm Dr. Maury. Do not worry. I operated on you. Everything is fine. You have a stent placed in your coronary artery. What did they put? Stent - a metal spring expands artery, preventing it from sticking together. I did a little hole, that's all. What else is nonsense? Monsieur Quentin, you've had a heart attack. attack. You were at work, in the toilet. Luckily you were sitting on the jolt and did not fall from a height. It looks like you put in more effort. than usual, and your heart failed. So you doing the toilet... Yes, that's it, I understand you. Who found me? Your colleague Gilles. He dressed you and even made mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration. You are in debt to a friend. He's not my friend and a colleague. We didn't find anyone to report to. I don't have anyone at all. No friends no family, no children? No friends, no family. No responsibility. Don't want, for someone to cry over my grave. But the grave too someone will have to order. I will die? Of course. Yes. But we all have time to die living here is hard. I advise everyone have someone outlive you and will be with you to the end. There comes a moment in life when we need others. Alone we are nothing. All the best. By the way, do you smoke? Yes. A little. See you then. Yes? Carmen? No. Excuse me, I'm looking for Carmen Rodriguez Lorca. One minute. Yes? I need Carmen Rodriguez Lorca. Carmen! You are being asked here. I ask you to. Door. Expensive. Come in. Twenty years. Twenty. Too much. How did you find me? Directory. Directory! It took you twenty years just something to find me in the directory?! You got it, didn't you? Your mother said you returned to Spain. And did you believe? Well, yes. You see, only twelve kilometers to disappear. Keep it if you like. I thought you'd be pleased. We are young. Afraid I won't recognize you? So you will die alone? No. I'm not going yet but they told me that I should beware. Me after all installed a stent in an artery, and this maybe… I'm sorry, why is he here? After all, we are talking about us, about my health. Same… Honey, do you mind? Yes, of course, I'll take panties. Panties, panties, where are you? I have, so to speak, uh, a farewell tour. Farewell tour? Yes, I want to say goodbye if suddenly something. I can offer you tomato juice, hot chocolate, cake. Do not be shy. Ah, cake? I see you have a new life, right? New life? Oh la la! Wow, what an expression! New life! But you know, Tony, my life is never collapsed. And Philip is a good man, stable, energetic. Well, what about America? America is only a dream. For now. You haven't changed, Tony. The same spirits. Same mustache. Not perfume, but cologne. And the mustache father had a mustache, grandfather had a mustache, and me mustache too. My grandfather had a mustache, but I don't. And you haven't changed. So why did you come? wanted you see. Sorry! Look, where do you live. With whom. Yes, and to calm my mother down. Understood. Parked close? No, I left it over there, a little further. OK. Tony. You didn't just come for me. Your daughter has a dance class in Paris. On the Rue Saint-Medar. Does she know about me? Only that you are somewhere, but children quickly forget everything. And so even better. Then don't tell her that I came. No, it's not worth it. I'm sorry, monsieur. My name is Max. How can I help you? I AM looking for Mary. Mary? Maria Quentin. Ah, no, Marie Quentin isn't here. What about Maria Rodriguez? Maria Rodriguez? Ah, so you need it, but say Maria Quentin, you won't understand. She is on the second floor in the Nuriev Hall. Thank you. And he says, Maria Quentin, go and figure it out. Stop, stop, stop! Yes? No no nothing. If you need country style, then you are in Montparnasse, and here is the best Vegas Forever course. No no. I didn't come to dance. This is not what is needed. I just wanted to ask. Here's how. Understand. At first we are shy, but we finish dance on the table to show that there is something between the legs chatting, huh? Okay, come at the end of the lesson, we'll talk. Maybe the desire will appear. Appetite comes with meals, huh? So go ahead! You misunderstood me. Let's. Hey Samba! Well, what do you think, cowboy? Yes I... So long, beauty. Bye. I AM.... I don't know how to say it. You see... Well... It's me. Who are you? I AM... You see, I.... Dad. Here it is. This is great. Congratulations. Who, boy, girl? No. No, no, no, not that. I am your dad. Sarah. I leave you the keys, I'll come tomorrow. OK. So long, Maria. Bye. Is she Mary? Maria Rodriguez? Exactly Maria. So you're a dad now? No, not dad. I'm not ready. Sorry. In her classes, you need to be able to dance. Auditions every first Wednesday of the month. But John Wayne's rumba these are steep jumps, without improvisations. So, you decided to declare like this: "Hi, I'm your dad, I've been missing for 20 yo, forgot about you. Sorry". Do you think she will accept you? She doesn't even know who you are. Maybe she doesn't want a father like that. You sign up for dancing. Just don't talk. Let you know. Tame her slowly. And when she's ready reveal everything to her. Yes, and the doctor advised you to exercise. Dancing. When did dancing become a sport, Gilles? And do you need rumba head? Rumba is not danced with the head. You have beautiful shoulders. Use them. Rumba. Rumba is a Cuban style of music. Congolese rumba. Yes? Do you want to learn how to dance the rumba? Boys! Yes I thought you have an idea. As the saying goes, you have it in your blood. "You" - that is, the blacks? Well no, not just black people. West Indies too. Thank you boys. Wow, but I ate, thanks. Are you afraid to get poisoned? No, it looks delicious. Enjoy your meal. Thank you. Cutlery? Cash register! And you want even though your ancestors surely flogged mine, want to find your daughter? Yes. And do you need me? Yes. Okay. From me - the Congolese rumba, from you - in school scooter. AND? What class are you in? I am a history teacher. What stories? Ours. History of France at the College Saint-Charles. Wow. Yes. Cool. Thanks Kassa. Not worth it. Are these your children? You are very perceptive, Tony. You are Tony, right? Yes, Tony. AND you are Ef Massamba, where is "Ef", Looks like Fatu, right? "Ef" is Fanny, like in Marseille's trilogy Pagnola - Cesar, Marius, Fanny. Oh, come on, Cesar, shoot, don't think! Break my heart! La Garriga is my dear country. Can I afford? You are not afraid to break with your appearance the balance of your daughter's life? No. I would just like to see her. Carefully. So. Rumba Congolese let's say it How in an old African proverb If don't know where to go return to the starting position. What about dancing? No. Understood. But riding a scooter to school in the morning is faster. Yes. The first steps in the Congolese rumba. This is funny. Are you going to learn to dance or not? I want, but, it's useless. Anyway, let's practice. Don't screw up or you won't get the keys. Do not worry. All tip-top. Let's go to. Fanny. One, two. Can you say? Yes. You can't do anything without music. You're running wild, too tough. Everyone on their own. And with the dance merge like a river. Fill them up. And do you understand? I studied choreography as a child, like everyone else. No, not everyone studied ballet at the age of five. Girls, maybe, but not all, Gilles. Eka is unseen! You will say too. In 1851, Napoleon III...two...banned work on Sundays and public holidays ...two... March 26, fifty-two, remember the year... Anais, we're writing! Well done! This allows mutual aid societies easy to create free. Agricultural production is growing and... The railroad network is expanding... Two pas, turn, two to the side. Recorded? Okay. And what is the dance? Rumba Congolese. And where did you study? In the Congo. It's clear. What about the Congo waltz salsa, Congolese tango? We have ballroom dancing here, not just rumba. If only, normal waltz. Deutsch. What is your name? Kevin. Kevin Sardu. Like a singer. Uh, no singer Kevin Sardu. OK. Are you madam? Lara Fabian. Are you spouses? No no no. He is my neighbour. No no no. She is my neighbour. Okay. See you on Wednesday. Well, see you then. Attention! Please everyone! Goodbye. I beg. Begin. Does not work. Damn it. Well, how? She is similar on my daughter? To me, you all look the same. Okay, good night and thanks. Haven't you forgotten anything? Hold on. See you tomorrow, Kevin. See you tomorrow, Lara. What an ass. Whoo! Thanks Manolo. Glad beauty.

I don't like to be seen. There's nowhere to hide here. Grab your waist. One hand here the second is on the hip. A little closer to the middle of the waist. Hug me. So. Close your eyes.

Represented? Yes. You can open your eyes. What did you saw? I dont know. We were moving like in space. Forward, to the side. Don't know.

You let us down so bad, Tony. So don't think now it will be so easy to come back. heck! Damn, damn, damn. Yes, this is for you. Beautiful. It... ...carnations. Good evening Kevin. Hello. You weren't in class? No, I missed the train. On the train? Where do you live? Long away. Have you been waiting for me? Annick, have you seen my bike? back off. Understand you. I'm sorry, today is a date with the ex - steward of Aero Madagascar. But you can make an appointment for another night. Sorry. Goodbye. Goodbye. Maria. Kevin. What did you want? I wanted to invite you for a drink. Need to talk. Now? As you say. For dinner? Dinner? Yes. Saturday at nine, after class. Is Pachamama restaurant okay? Yes. Will we talk there? Yes of course without problems. Than that's a deal. I will find. Goodbye then. Hey Maria, I planted your friend over there. Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered something to drink yet? No, I was waiting for you. Like? Yes, nice. Oh, and I have graters with my father. Or rather, not with his father, but with his stepfather. My father left me at 10 months old. He left his mother to return to duty. Became a monk. This is according to her. Monk? Yes. Is it in a toga and sandals? Yes, monk. Should have placed an order. Waiter please. Yes, monsieur.

And those mustaches of yours. A mustache is like a wall. Yes, that's it. Stop it, Maria. Everybody! You know I I love old people with mustaches. Why old man? Mademoiselle, please repeat. I am no old man. It's clear! What have you tied to your mustache? AND? I also like mustaches. They are mine! Everybody! Do not be angry. Enjoy. Let everyone think that you are my friend. Monsieur. Yes, yes, put it on. The baby sleeps with the old man. He either has loot. Or he is the fire in bed. Everybody! Stop it please. She said herself, you are good for your daughter. No. I'm not good for my daughter. But you are fit for fathers. Don't like me? Ugly? Not to your taste? It happens. Can't cross some border? You are beautiful. Maria, Maria! Hello! Hello. Will you sing to us, beauty? She will sing today! I...I don't speak Spanish, only in English. Strong thing. You be careful with her. I'm waiting. We wait. Well, is your boyfriend screwed up? I should have taken it younger. He's not my boyfriend. He is my father. Am I asleep? All arrived. Massi Paliso car park. Maybe take you home? Kevin. No, no, everything is OK. It's close, thanks. You think? About what? About us. I didn't say that I live in Pontoise, from unnecessary questions. From Massi Paliso 60 kilometers. What questions can there be? But you should have told her everything. She flirted. Like, "I like the mustache." Heck! She's still a child, here they are! But she is my daughter. Well, yes. But I've been making love all night. Well done! Was your wife satisfied? You will say too. Without her. One. I dream that I am driving along the road, and overtaking me huge thirty-eight ton truck, beautiful red. Sitting behind the wheel red-haired big man with huge hands and a beard. And next to him is his wife. Such a cutie. Her breasts are upright, pointed. In a word, everything is great. She waves her hand to me: “Come on, come on, join!" Did you sleep with his wife? It seems to be. Tell Gilles. All this for me? I like you. Twenty years without her, and so be it. Maybe she really needs you. Carmen, according to doctors, cannot give birth. Naturally. Her pregnancy came as a surprise. Yes, we fell in love with each other. But I still stayed. Not for long. As a result, we never got married. They were young. Have you left? Yes. Cowardly. They say, weeping - weeping, but still the deed is the deed. In Africa? Yes. It's clear. Think. Tell her who you are. Hi? Kevin. Mary is in the room now. I'm not Kevin. I'm Tony. My father. Your father. And now what? I'm here. We make up for lost time. Well, we'll have plans. Many things. Don't know. I AM... I will be your father. And will you be without a mustache? What are you doing in life? I am a college English teacher Saint-Charles in Pontoise. Truth? Is it in Saint-Charles? I'm sorry. This is Diego. Well, a teacher in Saint-Charles? I AM... Have you seen Harry Potter? Bye... I... I don't know all the teachers. This is Diego. Sorry. Nothing. You won't you ask me why I came back? First I want to know why you left. You hate me.? Are you surprised that I'm back? Sorry. Do you know what we'll do? No. Tomorrow I'll pick you up at college And I'll do what you didn't. But this is impossible. Strike tomorrow. Day after tomorrow? No, the day after tomorrow we have a school day. And on Thursday? There are no lessons. What about Friday Shabbat? Then Friday. Okay. Everybody! Agreement. Do you smoke? No no no. It happens sometimes. And here is Mr. SAMES. Yes. Well, what's the deal? Yes. Agreement. Hello. What's an old man? Its my father. And I'm your mother. He also had a mustache. Its my father. Which abandoned you? He is back. And he has plans. How does he just come back like that? You don't look like him. Besides, he brazenly lies to me. He is no teacher. He left me, and now I forgive him? If I were you yes, I would forgive. Give him a chance. So long, Tony. Bye. So long, Tony. Total. Chao! Until the evening. See you. Goodbye Tony, good luck. Bye. Until the evening, bye. Hey Kevin, Kevin wait. What? I AM... Hello monsieur. Hello. Good afternoon. Kind. Hello. Are you selling satchels or have you come for me? What? No, no, I didn't recognize him without a mustache. I have a date with my daughter. At the college? Yes. We agreed to meet, it's easier here. I told her everything, we need to get to know each other. I'm proud of you, dear. I'm late? No, no, no, I've been waiting for you. It was necessary to edit essay. AND? Hello Lara. Hi So you and neighbors and colleagues. And colleagues. Give me a ride? No, I have a car. Let's take a walk, shall we? Come on. I am now. Everything, I'll go. What's your outfit? Said the teacher. Yes, for show off. Make an impression? Do you think a mechanic is better in a cap? Speak from the heart be completely honest with her. Yes. Better put a satchel on your back. There are also belts. It's more comfortable for me. Do you know why ducks move their necks when are they sailing? No. They have a very long pupil. If this is not done, the look will not stabilize. and they don't see. It's clear. I think it's so weird. That I don't blame you at all. It would bring us closer. But I'm not perfect. What is your class? Which class? Oh shit! Heck! Where are you going? Damn, damn, damn. Hold on. Drowned. Boots. Just two days and so many lies. I wanted you to be proud. I AM simply school bus driver. And that's it. What is a bus driver? For him, life is in the rearview mirror. The first love. First joys. Disappointment. Tired Monday. Friday night delight. The cry of a child who has lost his grandmother. Or a briefcase. My job is to take the kids to what they hate trying not to shake them. I know everyone. I'm that one, whom everyone sees from behind. Nape. Mister back of the head. Yes, and not a perfect father. It's amazing what could connect you and mom? Yes. I wonder why she chose me? Grandma didn't really choose. The gardener's son was no good, she wanted a son doctor. Yes. And then you played in a band? Strummed. Can you play? Be my partner in Blackpool. What? instead of Greg. You will dance with me. I give you a chance. No, no, no, that's nonsense, what kind of dancer am I? I can't dance at all. You will learn everything. You can do it with your hands and you can do it with your feet. We can handle you. I promise you. And what should I do if you don't come to Friday? Who will take them? Turn to Gilles, he dreams of it. Gilles is old, and vision is nowhere. And I can't pay for another one. How much more do you have to repeat? It's still an international competition. And I owe it to my daughter. It would be better if she played rugby, at least there stadium next door. And that is dancing! Forgive me. I don't mind and love classic but... You shave your mustache, twirl your ass on rumba lessons. Look, don't play. Tony. Yes. OK. I give you two hours at the end of the week. You go there, and Marcel - back. That's all for now. Thanks Josie. Look Tony. 7.8, times, 2, times, cha-cha-cha, 2, 3 cha-cha-cha. Happened? It seems to be. Believe and you'll do it. That's all for today. Happy family project. Bye. Your Diego has been waiting. And you try on your suit. Okay. And stop smoking. The lack of technology is filled with energy. Understood. There is! Cool. So cool! I'm making up for lost time. You. And you? No. I have toast. For that who saved my life. So. Now I. Fanny, Thanks. And you. I'll go play and then I will pay. Just one a day. Exercise the heart, one at a time. Yes, if you train. Mind! My behavior is strict. I AM - fragile creature. It's hard to seduce me. We must fight. Convince. Solve the mystery. For a destiny that will unite us. For you! Tony. Tony. Tony. Tony. Tony. You crush me. It's boring. Tiring. Tell me, were the efforts intense? Well. Were there any excesses? No. No no no. Then you just wouldn't fall asleep on the lady. No, there was nothing like that. Means, you suddenly feel strong chest pain? Yes, that's what worries me. I overdid it a little. You need rest, Monsieur Quentin. Make your heart work but very soft. And no cigarettes. I'm quitting Josie. You can't leave. And what about me? You know I'm sick. I can't carry kids anymore. Well, sick and sick. Take your medicine, Efferalgan. You just don't get fired. Life isn't what you want it to be, Tony. In thirty years of work, no one has come to me pestered. But I stayed, I love my job. AND? So don't fool me. I'll leave. I'll leave because I need a daughter, and not disappoint her. I liked you dumb and mustachioed. Who is this? Annick said you were sick. You cannot enter the competition. I'm healing, I'm not sick! It wasn't dancing that bored me. I ride a bike. I'm fine It's just that Annick and I overdid it a little, did not take into account their age. Please, Maria. Give me a chance. Promise me not to smoke. And then you will come with me. Everybody. This is the last one. Promise. Then we dance. Dance should become part of you. Like you're walking without realizing, the left leg is pulling right behind you or vice versa. One, 2 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 8. Watch the body, swaying out side to side. Dance as a reflex. Every step is automatic. Forget that you are being watched. One, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7, 8. Watch your hands. It's like you sing, but they don't listen to you. Then you sing louder override the music. Straighten your shoulders. Pull in your stomach. So. Dance is not a science, it is rather breathing. Dance is our essence. 6, 7, 8, and one, 2. And froze. Every movement is fleeting. And it must be done forever. When you hug me I am no longer Maria. I am you, you are me. We are one, and each on its own. This is the hardest thing to understand. There is! Yes. Don't try to be better than others. You only have to transcend yourself. And most importantly - do not think that I said. No, they've lost their rhythm. Think you'll fall 7, 8, times, 2, 3, 4. Just breathe. Dance as a reflex. 4, 5, 6… Do not think. There is only you. And I. 5, 6, 7, 8 is good. Shoulders! Ladies and Gentlemen!
