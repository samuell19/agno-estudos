Those Akina hicks have a long ways to go before they can compete with us. We'll leave 'em in the dust, no sweat! I don't believe this! Is this really my 8-5?! It's him! That Levin we just saw up on top of Mt. Akina! That 8-5 Levin! An 8-5? Don't be ridiculous! There's no way a turtle like an 8-5 could catch up with me! Takumi, your eyes have gone all steely. Itsuki, I know you think it's a little scary, but trust me. Oh, no! I am WAY scared now! We're going to show everyone who made fun of this car what it can really do. It really is that 8-5! Huh? What is this? We're going downhill, but I can't accelerate at all. And these tires don't bite at all. As soon as they start slipping, they don't stop. I can't shake him! That kid behind us is crazy good! It's insane how fast he is! So slow. Shall I try it? The hell?! How did they pass me?! Those kids tricked us! That's no 8-5! It's gotta be an 8-6! I'd think that... except it's rolling like a son of a bitch! It's roll understeering! But it's so fast! What the hell is with that car?! That's enough! That's enough, Takumi! INITIAL D DREAM Here. Thank you. Racing a car like that... My whole view of life's been changed. That was an amazingly different dimension. You were that scared? I'm sorry. I did it because they called your car a junk heap. It's nothing to apologize for, Takumi. I can't help but be happy. Huh? It was my dream to own my own car. That's why I was working so hard at my job. But... after being sure I'd bought an 8-6, to find out it was an 8-5... Hey, did you hear that?! It's not an 8-6! It's an AE85! An 8-5...! Oh, it's a "slower than a turtle" 8-5! Note: SOHC = Single Overhead Cam The body looks like an 8-6, but the engine's an SOHC for old folks! I'm crying here! Someone's actually driving an 8-5 in this day and age?! Well, it's perfect for some wannabe racer kid! You have fun trying not to get passed by any tour buses, okay? God, I haven't laughed so hard in ages! But now I understand. It's not the car's performance. With the right skills, it can race at incredible speeds like that. I really like this car now. I'll treasure driving it. I'll practice as hard as I can, and if anyone laughs at it, I won't mind at all. My Levin really is the best! Yeah. I envy you. You're one to talk, seeing how you have a real 8-6! That's my dad's car. We were shocked when you brought this to the gas station... When you drove up in this. It may be used, but a high schooler owning his own car is pretty amazing. I really did envy you, Itsuki. Takumi... I thought, maybe I can drive well, but a guy who doesn't own a car can't be called a racer. Iketani-senpai and Kenji-senpai and everyone else own their cars. And they take such good care of them. Like they're a part of themselves. Seeing that makes me want a car of my own. You've really changed lately. You used to show no interest at all. Nice sound on that one. Maybe it's coming home from a race on the mountain. It's coming up soon, huh, Takumi? Your battle with Ryousuke Takahashi. Yeah. Think you'll win? That guy's the real deal. I think he's really fast. Faster than anyone I've met till now. That's why... I'm so excited. You really have changed. Local Business Consortium Job Fair Fujiwara Hi, Mogi. You've got the day off from work today, right? Want to go somewhere and hang out? Sure, I guess. Tokimeki Deck Mt. Nikko-Shirane Mt. Akagi Mt. Komochi Mt. Nikko-Shirane Mt. Akagi Mt. Tatetaka Mt. Komochi Mt. Nikko-Shirane Jouetsu Shinkansen Huh? You're buying a car, Takumi? No, not for a while. Pay from a part-time summer job would never be enough. I mean, I've been working till now, but I finally found a goal to work towards. A goal... I wish I had one of those. I don't have any goals. Mine isn't much of one. I think it'll be impossible till I start working full-time. That's not true. I know you'll buy one. Until then, you've got the Trueno, right? It's so cute! I'd like a car like that. Don't you like it, Takumi? I like it. It's fun to drive and a really great car. But it isn't my car. I never knew you had such an interest in car racing, Takumi. August 27th, 10:00PM. I'll be waiting at the top of Mt. Akina. Ryosuke Takahashi A written challenge. It's like something out of a historical drama. Let's see... The school's over that way, huh? Then is Mt. Akagi past there? And way, way past that is the sea, right? I think. It's so large... There are so many... so many different places we know nothing about, huh? I see. It's this Saturday, huh? Yeah. The Akagi RedSuns versus the Akina SpeedStars. Or rather... a downhill battle between Ryousuke Takahashi's RX7 and Akina's 8-6 means one thing: Another carnival on the mountain this weekend. Your boy's a real wonder. In just one summer, he's become Akina's hero. His driving's changed. Before, sure, he was good, but... lately, he's been making the effort to learn how to drive faster. He's cleared his first hurdle... and it suits him. Say, Bunta, you planned all this from the start, didn't you? Ever since you decided to have Takumi make the deliveries, right? Hm? What do you mean? Having him drive without spilling that cup of water to keep the tofu from getting damaged, right? You really did it to drill the basics of load shifting into him, didn't you? I'm not sure. Frankly, at first, I think it was more because the tofu was important. But Takumi had a knack for it. It's true... As he developed, I adjusted the brake suspension and transmission to keep up with him. I admit that I've been trying to lead his driving style along the lines that I prefer. What are you after? What were you thinking, giving Takumi a gifted student program in driving technique? I wasn't really after anything. It's just fun seeing Takumi get better and better. I'm sure someday he'll be better than me, and then he'll start doing what he truly wants. Doesn't matter what. If he can do what I couldn't, that'll be fine. I see. It never changes, does it? The night view from up here. The world is changing so much... but we've been in this town a long time, and never changed at all. From the old days. Iketani-senpai, I'm kind of reluctant about this. I've only ever driven the 8-6, so I don't think I'll drive it very well. Please, Takumi. I think a little cruising will be a great learning experience. Right... Well, what should I do? Try a braking drift. I want to learn the timing. I see... Whoa! You going, like, right now?! Aren't you going way too fast?! Oh... I dunno who that is, but they're making some beautiful music, aren't they? Well, maybe we should go, too. To check this stubborn suspension. R-rig ht! Incredible! It's just like Itsuki said. 8-5 or Silvia, any car he gets into for the first time is fast! Incredibly fast! But, for some reason, he can be calm. Is it really true that you're never scared sitting next to a good driver, even when they're flying? It's a little different from my car, but I've got the hang of driving this. Huh?! Okay, we're gonna drift now. We're gonna drift now?! So, what have we been doing up to this point?! Here it comes! Here it comes! Here it comes! That incredible entry speed! WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BUNTA?! Nothing. Just getting a cigarette. C-c-c-ciga...?! We're in the middle of a drift! We're dead! Hm... Meh, whatever. Okay, shall we do this for real? You...! There are limits to how much someone doesn't change! LET ME OUT OF HERE! Oh, man... last night was hell. They say you're never scared sitting next to a good driver, even when they're flying, but that's a load of crap. Because chasing speed is Bunta's special brand of crazy. Still, Bunta can see that Takumi has it just as much. Hm? The White Comet of Akagi? That's what they used to call Ryousuke Takahashi? Yeah. I think it was three years ago... Rumor spread that a crazy fast white FC3S was making a name for itself on Mt. Akagi, which already had high-level racers. It was a lone wolf named Ryousuke Takahashi. Lone wolf? What about the Akagi RedSuns? The RedSuns were originally a team created by Ryousuke Takahashi to pursue driving technique. They were different from the common touge racing teams made up of friends Note: Gymkhana events are courses in which racers compete for the best time on tracks with obstacles that require various driving techniques to clear. who'd go out for gymkhana events and circuit races. Note: Gymkhana events are courses in which racers compete for the best time on tracks with obstacles that require various driving techniques to clear. Is that why they're at such an incredibly high level? Now that his younger brother Keisuke has joined, they're an established set as the "Takahashi Brothers," but for me, he'll always be "The White Comet of Akagi." Because in Gunma, Ryousuke Takahashi is by far the more charismatic. "The White Comet of Akagi," huh? Awesome! I'm getting even more psyched for Saturday's battle! Right, Takumi? Aren't you? Huh? Oh, for...! How can you be so laid back?! I was just saying how psyched I was! Mm. Are you gonna be okay with that attitude? Mm. I heard at the shop. Is it true, Keisuke? Ryousuke turned down an offer from a pro team? Yeah. It's true. I see... Was it too hard juggling that with his medical studies at the university? For my brother, that would be a piece of cake. Then why? RS Giger is a big-name team that's gotten records in production car races at Fuji! Turning pro, getting into the spotlight, and getting commercial deals is the kind of success story every racer dreams of, isn't it?! Kenta, Ryousuke has no interest in the pro world. Then why is he so passionate about competing in circuits and gymkhana races? What's he doing it for?! For the open road. For my brother, it's all about the process. For pushing the open road to the limit. TAKAHASHI Welcome home, Big Brother. Is the FC finished? Yeah. I'm going to take a run on Mt. Akagi. Want to come? I'll be right down! So? How high does the power go now? Don't be shocked when I tell you, Keisuke. It maxes out at 260 horsepower now. You tuned it down?! From 340?! Why would you intentionally reduce it? I thought you learned that lesson in your battle with him before. More than power, the key to a downhill race is total balance. I lowered the power in order to drive faster. It's a profound secret of the open road. In other words, you consider him that much of a challenge? The Akina 8-6... I suppose he is. Till now, I had the confidence to show off big power on the downhill, too. Which is why detuning it now is a disgrace for me. I feel I can't lose, even if it means abandoning my pride. Incredible! You've definitely increased your exit speed on the corners! There's one other reason I lowered the FC's power. Even if I passed him on the straightaways with pure power, I couldn't say that I'd beaten that 8-6. And that wouldn't satisfy me. Technique for technique... ...and drift for drift I will beat him! I'm so glad to have met an opponent who makes me feel this way. I'm not Ryousuke Takahashi of the RedSuns now. I feel like I'm back to being The White Comet of Akagi. Big Brother... Takumi? Don't you enjoy being with me? Huh? You keep staring up into the sky. Like your mind's a million miles away. Am I? Sorry. Thinking about cars? The clay after tomorrow, I'm battling a guy who's really skilled, fast, and famous. He's all I can think about lately. I suppose there's no helping being worried about him. Is that what they call "pressure"? Is that all? Cars... they're no good unless they're fast? If you don't want to do it, you can just ignore it, can't you? There's no rule that says you have to accept a challenge from someone. It's not that I don't want to. I don't know whether I'll win or lose... but I have no intention of running from this. That's just the way you are, Takumi. When you really want to do something, you can't wait to do it, right? You seem so quiet, but inside, you've got a really competitive spirit. I knew that. I wasn't just the Soccer Club's manager for show. LAKE MONA Should we head back? Uh-uh. A little longer. Let's talk a little longer, in the car. Okay, I guess. Look... there's one other thing I know. I really did know... why you punched that third-year in the Soccer Club's room. A second-year girl told me a while after you'd quit the club. Natsuki's body? It's the best! Oh, man! I can't take this! Every time I see Mogi's face now, I'm gonna get all kinds of crazy fantasies! Now, don't be jealous! Don't be jealous! Just the other day... Enough with your stupid sex talk, already. We're sick and tired of hearing it! What's your problem, Fujiwara?! I'm dating Natsuki! I can say whatever I want! And who the hell are you to talk that way to an upperclassman?! I can talk however the hell I want! You got angry on my account. I'm sorry. For misunderstanding for so long. L-it's okay, really. It doesn't matter now. Fujiwara Tofu (Private Use! Fujiwara Tofu (Private Use! See? Takumi's acting weird, right? Definitely weird! I'll admit, now that you mention it... But, doesn't Takumi usually just space out like that? It's been especially bad for the last four or five days. It's like he's totally gone to another place. At first, I thought his head was full of tomorrow's battle, but... But it's not that? Then what? What you were talking about before, Kenji-senpai. You mean how that friend of his said he saw the Panda Trueno with a girl in it yesterday?! Oh, come on! It's not that weird that Takumi would have a girlfriend. Nope! That's gotta be it. That guy... has sex on the brain! For real?! Welcome. High octane? Yeah, fill her up. Sure thing. You don't need to wipe the glass. Right. Thank you, sir. Hey, isn't that dangerous? Having sex on the brain the day before a battle? What do we do, Iketani? I wish I could find love, too. A burning love...! Okay, this really isn't the best time for that... I'll do what I can! Huh? And I will do it without self-centered emotions like envy or selfishness! What did you want to talk about? You've been seeing a girl lately and hiding it from me, haven't you? I haven't been "hiding it" from you. It's just not something I'd go out of my way to announce. Spare me the excuses. Just answer this question. How far have you gone with her? Tell me straight! "How far"...? We've gone to Lake Akina. Oh, for...! That's not what I meant, you idiot! Look ahead of you! Itsuki, eyes on the road! So... you've kissed her at least, right? I have. WHAT?! Would you stop swerving like that?! Takumi, you've been acting weird for the last two or three days. I've been thinking all this time. I can pretty much tell what about. It's not tomorrow's battle, is it? Yeah. That's right. I've been thinking about... what comes after that. Wh-wh-what comes after?! You...! You've got some nerve, talking about that to an 18-year-old guy with no girlfriend! There's only one thing that comes after you kiss, right? A hotel, right? A hotel! What are you talking about? Huh? I'm talking about what comes after tomorrow's battle. No matter how I figure it, I feel nervous and can't pin down why. I'm stuck. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Don't you understand what I'm saying? I don't. Why does anything have to come after the battle? There doesn't have to be anything after it. You're plenty fast as you are now. I'm not fast at all. You are fast! Look, Takumi, please! Stop getting distracted and concentrate on the battle. This time tomorrow, you'll be racing Ryousuke Takahashi! There's a car coming up. Not just one... Two cars. That's...! That's Keisuke Takahashi's FD! And a black GT-R... It's Takeshi Nakazato from the NightKids! Wh-why are they battling on Mt. Akina? Wow... Does it really look that awesome when you see it from outside? Man, cars are fast. What are you talking about?! That's nothing compared to when you're going downhill! Did you forget? You beat those two. I may have beaten them, but under restricted circumstances. Still, those guys... wherever they go, they go fast. I can't help thinking about that 8-6. I wanted to see it again so much that it got me out here to Mt. Akina all of a sudden. Nakazato... We've got a downhill specialist named Shingo on our team. Bad dude, but a great driver. He lost to the Akina 8-6 not long ago, but... he was almost happy to praise its technique to the skies. He doesn't praise others easily. The conceit is strong in that one. Such are the charms of that 8-6... When I battled it and saw those drifts with my own eyes, they were so magnificent, it entranced me as well. I don't want him to lose to any other racer but me. No matter who he races. The 8-6 lies completely exposed. The simulation for victory has already been laid out in my brother's head. I can't imagine my brother losing. The two of them are in different leagues. When they race, one of them will have to lose. Why do I not want to see the two of them battle?! Boys really love cars, don't they? Are cars really that great? I think they are. They let you go any place you want to. Just that? There's a profound mystery to cars. Anybody can drive one if they have a license, but I don't think there are many who can truly master driving them. SHIYA LIQUOR If I win this, what do I do then? Thinking about that... feels good, in a way. Takumi... you're such a perv. HUH?! Where'd that come from?! Oh, now I get it! I've been wondering what's been bugging you! I think I've just seen the secret of your pheromones! Please don't jump to conclusions! You have no idea what I'm talking about! It's okay, it's okay. Jeez... It's tonight, isn't it? The car race. Yeah. I once saw a crash. It's okay if you lose, just don't get in an accident. Absolutely not that. Promise me. At last, the time's come. Yeah. The undefeated street racing legend, Ryousuke Takahashi of the RedSuns... versus the Akina 8-6, the rising wonder who beat Keisuke Takahashi and Takeshi Nakazato. It's a de facto showdown for the title of fastest racer in Gunma! Hm... Hey, Make. Don't you think the atmosphere here is weirdly heavy? Yeah... Is it always like this in Akina? This feels weird to me. It feels like, no matter which one wins or loses, it's gonna be tough to take. I know what you mean. It's not just about Ryousuke Takahashi and the Akina 8-6 being fast. They're mysterious racers who have a strange charm to them. When this battle's over, something will change. I have that feeling. So, that's what it is... The newbs are up higher. The gallery may be eager to see it from that point... but that's not where the race will be decided. This is the only point where those two will challenge each other. You figured that out too, Shingo? I suppose I should say I'm impressed. Heh... same here. Takumi still isn't here? I can't take much more of this. It's suffocating. A huge gallery's turned out on the course, too. Iketani-senpai, what brings out this many people? Well, now... Admiration, maybe? "Admiration"? Admiration for the super-technique to be unleashed by Takumi and Ryousuke Takahashi. Everyone gathered on this mountain... loves cars more than they can stand. It's here! The Panda Trueno! So, that's Akina's downhill specialist, huh? When you see it once, it's beyond your wildest dreams! Those amazing drifts of his! This is finally getting exciting, Sayuki! He's good. Keisuke, I've been thinking about it. When I'm defeated on the road, I'm retiring. Wh-what's brought this on? Don't say that! There's no way you'll lose! I'll step back from the front line and advance the Fastest in Kanto Project in a different form than I have till now. No... If you quit, what happens to the RedSuns? They'll have you, right? Me? I can't hold a candle to you. If you don't come in first here, then we're finished! "One day, I will be beaten by him." There are only two racers I've ever thought of that way. One, Keisuke... is you. Me? And the other one... Don't worry. I still don't intend to be beaten by anyone. Takumi! Today, we drive for all we're worth. Looks like this is going to be a fun night. Here goes the count! 5 seconds! 4... 3... 2... 1... GO! It's begun! The ultimate downhill battle in the history of Mt. Akina's racers! The 8-6 is battling an equally-matched FC! Go, Takumi! This is the usual way my brother does things. The first battle here is to let the opponent get ahead, and then blow past from behind. It's how he's beaten every opponent till now! The 8-6 has taken the lead! Wow! Whoa! Go! Go! Awesome! Amazing! They nearly collided in that super twin drift just now! Both cars have been showing their stuff from the start! They're too amazing! Both of them! But that's not the drift style that Ryousuke Takahashi usually uses, is it? He's using his opponent's area of expertise to pin him down. Betting it all on the will of the Street King! I'm surprised. His countersteer turning angle has decreased in just half a month. That large countersteer he'd do after his turn-in is vanishing. He's advanced in a very short time. But it won't change the outcome. I'm going to win. He's sticking to me perfectly...! Seriously? Both cars are slipping through a tricky downhill set of consecutive corners like these? Still, it must be tough for the 8-6. Having someone stick to him like that. Yeah. It's common sense in the racing world that pursuing has more of a technical and psychological advantage than leading. Even more so when you're up against Ryousuke Takahashi. The pressure he puts on you is nothing to sneer at! Amazing. It gives me goosebumps. A beginning racer goes fast on the straightaways. An intermediate masters the corners. But a high-level racer takes the lead on a third point, neither straightaway nor corner. Mastering that point is the main theme of my theory of street speed supremacy. To think I'd meet a near perfect sample of that theory here... I've been able to keep up with him by copying his lines and rhythms, but even I would have difficulty reproducing them. This guy is a monster...! It's no use! I can't shake him! Wh-what?! What the hell kind of segment time is that?! I thought I measured it wrong too, but... he's eight seconds faster than in the exchange race we had before. 8 seconds?! 8 seconds faster than when Keisuke raced him? What are those two cars doing?! He's there! He's still there! The gutter trick isn't going to work. Like I thought, I wasn't ready to win this. I'll lose this battle. I don't want to lose it, but I'm going to lose! Right! If they reach the goal at this pace, both cars may break the course record the 8-6 set last time by nearly 12 seconds! Are you kidding me? That's insane! That's enough. Yeah, this has gotten way too dangerous. A battle to the very limit that only those two can wage. No doubt about it. Tonight's battle will become legendary! Takumi...! They're almost to the 5 consecutive hairpins! The hard braking battle they've waged on the straightaways up to now has been incredible. The 8-6 is in the lead! You're going too fast. You won't be able to turn! Goddammit...! TURN! He slipped past! The FC's in the lead! I don't believe it. The 8-6 understeered when it entered the corner! I guess no racer can escape when Ryousuke Takahashi's snapping at them. He's a strange one, this guy. Even with his high-level technique, he's not used to battles. He's surprisingly fragile when cornered. My plan had been to tail him longer and hold my cards to my vest, but now that I've taken the lead, I'll leave him behind and lock in this victory! They're even better than I'd heard. The speed range of those two cars is different from the drift kids you see all over. But, it's all over. Ryousuke Takahashi's won this battle, right? Normally yes, since he's in front. Except in terms of line severity, the 8-6 is in better shape. That 8-6 isn't dead yet. He's not extending his lead? I figured he'd leave me behind all at once, but... our speeds aren't that different! In that case, I can cut it down! This gap between us, even a little! Even just by a meter or two, I can get closer to that white RX7 racing ahead of me! I'm getting closer! I'm gaining on him! I won't lose! I'm faster! My front tire grip! Are they overheating, right at the end? Still, even if my tires are losing a little of their grip, my technique is as good as ever! The winner... will be me! DAMMIT! GO! Almost time. From the sound of that squealing, they're neck and neck. Just as we predicted. The goal's close. If one's got a do-or-die trick to pull, it'll have to be at this point. A straightaway you need for speed after a battle of braking. The only three-lane corner on the normally narrow Akina roads, giving you a high degree of freedom for your line. And then after that, those two overlapping R-corners. Whoever has the lead coming out of those corners will win! Here they come! All right! The 8-6 is snapping at his ass! Okay, now what?! How do you attack?! From outside?! He'll never pass on the outside! Inside is the shortest distance! It's an absolute advantage! The FC's fishtailing! It can't grip! It's stalling out! What about the 8-6?! It's broken through! That gave me chills. Damn... Yeah... The moment he casually crossed the line doing a four-wheel drift, the goosebumps over my whole body told me... We're lucky. To have been able to witness a real battle. Not one person said a word. No voices were raised, either by those disappointed at Ryousuke Takahashi's defeat, or joyful for Takumi's victory. Everyone there stood still, not moving a muscle. The one undeniable truth... was that a downhill course record had been set in Akina that would never be broken. The curtain had fallen on a miraculous battle. And... something had begun. There's something I've been wondering about. Would you tell me, please? Why did you wait for me to catch up? That's a grave misunderstanding. You picked up your pace on your own. True, my front tires were giving me trouble, and I slowed down minimally to hold you back. I won't make any excuses. The conditions were the same for you. And yet you never raised a peep from your tires. This was my loss. To have learned such techniques at such a young age... I'm genuinely impressed. Everyone overestimates me! I'm just more used to driving on Mt. Akina than most people! I honestly don't have any special techniques! I, um... I absolutely don't think that I was that much faster than you. Did you stop me just to tell me that? I've seen all kinds of people, but I've never seen anyone else like you. You're a good guy. I like you. It's Takumi Fujiwara, right? Don't be satisfied with a small stage. Turn your eyes to a larger world. A larger world...! We'll meet again. A larger world, huh? That's what was making me feel so nervous. I learned to drive in Akina and grew up in Akina. All I know is Mt. Akina. What sort of mountains lie outside of it? What sorts of people are there, and what sorts of cars do they drive? Here. Takumi. Dad. Wh-what is it, Dad? No, you tell me what you were going to say. Nothing... it's not important. I didn't have anything important to say, either. I see. See you later. Now, then... That car... Heh... wanna show me what you've got? All right, then!
