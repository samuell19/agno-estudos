WELL, WHY DON'T I START? BUT THEA CHILD WHO VALUESIS ADOLETHE"DEAR SIR,ORD. I AM SENDING YOU THIS VASE BECAUSE WE REALLY NEEDTO SELL IT. WHEN I CALLED YOU LAST YEAR, YOU SAID YOU THOUGHTMAYBE IT WAS WORTH SOME MONEY, BUT YOU'D HAVE TO SEE IT FIRST, SO HERE IT IS. YOU ALSO SAID YOU WOULD HAVEBUT YTO KNOW HOW OLD IT ISIRST, AND WHERE WE GOT ITAND THE WHOLE STORY OF IT. SO HERE IT GOES. WE LIVE ON A FARM. IT IS VERY HARD WORK AND HARDLY ANYBODYHAS A REAL FARM ANYMORE. BUT MY MOM SAYS THAT'S THE WAYWE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT AND THAT'S WHY OUR MILKIS THE BEST, AND THAT NOTHING BEATS AND THHAPPY COWSUR MILKAND HARD WORK AND HOPE. BUT THAT'S WHERETHE VASE COMES IN, AND THHAPPY COWSUR MILKBECAUSE TIMES ARE BAD AGAIN AND WE ARE ALMOSTOUT OF HOPE NOW. WE ARE A FAMILY OF FARMERS. OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN RAISING COWS AND SELLING MILKAND MAKING CHEESE FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS. THE WOMEN IN OUR FAMILYALWAYS HAVE GIRLS, AND THEY ALL GROW UPTO BE FARMERS, EXCEPT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, A GIRL GETS BORNWHO JUST WANTS ADVENTURE. THAT WASGREAT-GRANDMOTHER BETTY. WHEN WORLD WAR II STARTED, GREAT-GRANDMA BETTYLEFT THE FARM AND JOINEDTHE WOMEN'S ARMY CORPS. EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD WHY BETTY RAN OFFTO JOIN THE WAR, BUT ALL THE WOMEN IN OUR FAMILYARE FARM FOLK, AND MAYBE THEY WANDER SOMETIMES, BUT SOONER OR LATER,THEY ALL COME HOME. WHEN BETTY WENT TO WAR, SHE GOT MARRIEDTO AN ARMY CAPTAIN. AND THE MAN WHO MARRIED THEM GAVE THEM THIS VASEAS A WEDDING PRESENT. SHE DIDN'T BRINGHER HUSBAND HOME. GAVE THEM THIS VASEAS JUST THE VASE.ENT. AND A BABY. THAT BABYWAS OUR GRANDMA ISABEL. FIVE GENERATIONSHAVE LIVED ON THIS FARM, THAT BABYWAS WITH THIS VASE,BEL. AND WE ALL BELIEVED WHATGREAT-GRANDMA BETTY HAD SAID, THAT THE VASE WAS PROBABLY WORTHWAS A LOT OF MONEY.BEL. SHE CALLED ITOUR "JUST-IN-CASE-VASE." WE COULD ONLY SELL IT IF WE REALLY, REALLYDIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE-- WE BUT IF WE WEREL IT THE STRONG AMERICAN WOMENDWE WERE RAISED TO BE, WE WOULD ALWAYSTHINK OF SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE IT CAME TO THAT. AND WE ALWAYS DID. ONE YEAR, WE PRACTICALLY LOSTA WHOLE HERD OF JERSEYS TO A COW EPIDEMIC. SOMETIMES, A BAD YEAR MEANT WE JUST ATEEGGS AND PEANUT BUTTER SOAND CANS OF SOUP,AR SO THE COWS COULD HAVE HAY, BUT THEY NEVER SOLD THE VASE. [SINGING] SOMETIMES, THERE WERETORNADOS, AND DROUGHTS, AND BLIZZARDS, AND FLOODS. SOMETSOMETIMES,E WEREWE HAD TO TRADE STUFF AWAY-- BUT WE NEVER SOLD THE VASE. BUT SIX MONTHS AGO, DADDY DIED IN A TRACTOR ACCIDENTIN THE WEST PASTURE, AND THAT'S WHYWE ARE IN TROUBLE NOW. OUR MOM AND DADREALLY, REALLY... LOVED EACH OTHER, AND... OUR MOM AND DADREALLY, REALLY LOVED EACH OTHER, AND SHE'S STILL SO SAD,SHE CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, AND PEGGY AND I ARE TRYINGTO TAKE CARE OF BUNNY AND SHE'S STILL SO SAD,SHE CAAND THE COWSOF BED, AND GO TO SCHOOL AND... TRADE MILKTO PAY THE BILLS. THEN LAST WEEK, A LADY CAMEFROM THE SOCIAL SERVICES AND ASKED WHERE OUR MOTHER WAS. A LADY CAMEWE TOLD HER SHE WAS SLEEPING AND SHE SAIDSHE'D BE BACK NEXT WEEK. SO IF WE CAN JUST SELL THE VASE, WE CAN PAY THE BILLS, AND MAMA WILL FEEL BETTER BEFORE SOMEBODY COMESTO TAKE US AWAY." WELL, THAT'S ALL THERE IS. I HOPE THAT THEY'RE-- WELL,THEY'RE STILL...E IS. HOW OLD WOULD SHE BE NOW? OH, ABOUT 28? MS. MCINERNEY,ULD SHE BE NOW? WOULD YOU DOSOME RESEARCH ABOUT 28? ON 100-YEAR-OLDFAMILY FARMS IN THE AREA?

AND RITA, WILL YOUTAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VASE, AND MAKE A FEW COPIES, AND THEN LOCK THE VASE AWAYTAKE PHOIN THE SAFE?THE VASE, WHEREVER THE SAFE IS NOW. GOT IT. IF THE VASE TRULY ISFROM EUROPE, THEN I DOUBT WE'LL BE ABLETO TRACE IT BACK TO SOME DAIRY FARM IN-- I'M ASSUMING COLORADO... IF IT WAS MISADDRESSEDAND RETURNED TO SENDER, THEN MARY LOU WOULDI'M ASSNEVER HAVE HEARD BACK IF IT WAS MISADDRESSEDAND RETFROM "DEAR SIR."

LONG ENOUGH TO READ IT, AND EVENIF SHE DID SIGN YOUR PAPERS, AND EVEN IFSHE MANAGED TO SEND IT BACK, I DOUBT ANY OF THAT WOULD HAPPENIN TIME FOR US TO SELL THE VASE AND GET THE MONEY SO THAT WE CAN PAY OUR TAXESAND OUR BILLS AND SAVE OUR FARMHOUSE AND LET OUR MOTHER DIE IN PEACE!

EVEN IF WE COULD FINDTHE RIGHT DOCTOR, AND THE RIGHT TREATMENTTO SLOW IT DOWN, EVEN IF WE COULD FINDSOONER OR LATER,, THE BONE MARROW JUST STOPSMAKING RED BLOOD CELLS. AND SOME FANCY, EXPENSIVE VASEISN'T GOING TO CHANGE THAT. BUT, IF IT'S TRUE, IF WE COULD SELL IT, AND POSTPONE THE AUCTION, IT SURE WOULD BE NICE TO BE LOOKING AT ALL THIS WHEN MY TIME COMES. IT IS A TRULY BEAUTIFUL PLACE. ABBY SAYS THAT SOOKIE IS STUBBORN, POLLY LIKES TO STAYIN THE PARLOR,ABBY SAYS AND, WELL,ARABELLE LIKES TO WANDER. THAT'S JUST WHO THEY ARE. THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT. MARY LOU ALWAYS-- ALWAYS HAD CRAZY IDEASGROWING UP. AND ALWAYS MANAGEDTO MAKE THEM WORK. THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO HARD ON HER WHEN HER BIGGEST DREAMDISAPPEARED IN THE U.S. MAIL. WE ARE SO SORRY ABOUT THAT. IT MADE US STRONGER. AND IT MADE MARY LOUDETERMINED TO PROVE HERSELF. SHE WENT TO COLLEGE, SHE WORKED FOR A NEWSPAPERDETEAND A RADIO STATION,ELF. AND NOW SHE RUNSSHAROUND THE WORLD,, SHE WORKED FOR A NEWSPAPERDEFOLLOWING WAR AFTER WAR,F. AND TELLS STORIES ABOUT FOLKSWHO'RE FIGHTING TO SURVIVE IN A LOT WORSE CIRCUMSTANCESTHAN OURS. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIMEYOU SAW HER? THREE CHRISTMASES AGO. SHE AND PEGGY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT SOMETHING SILLY, AS USUAL, AND IT ENDED UP WHERE THINGS ALWAYS ENDS UP. I CAME BACK. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?I'M NOT A FARMER, OKAY? OH, YES. WELL,THAT IS THE TRUTH! WHA-IF YOU HAD BEEN...ME?I'M-YOU'RE JEALOUS.KAY? OH, GREAT,WE'RE BACK TO THE VASE! [PEGGY]: YES! [MARY LOU]:WI'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,! AND I'M SORRY! I WAS A 10-YEAR-OLD KID. I CAN'T KEEP COMING BACK HERE JUST TO BE PUT ON TRIALOVER AND OVER AGAIN. I'M OUT OF HERE. [KIM]:AND NOW THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON WHY SHE CAN'T MAKE IT BACK HERE. SHE'S ALWAYS... "EMBEDDED" WITH SOME TROOPS IN SOME COMBAT ZONE SOMEWHERE. DOES SHE EVEN KNOWYOU'VE BEEN SICK? I... I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE SHE IS. IT'S SO... IT'S SO PEACEFUL HERE. IT'YEAH... THIS IS MY FAVORITE TIME OF DAY. WHEN THE COWSCOME HOME FOR THE NIGHT. THE SUN STARTS TO SET, THE EVENING COMES, AND SOMEHOW, THEY JUST KNOWIT'S TIME TO COME HOME. SOMEDAY, SO WILL I. I JUST HOPE WE'RE ALL TOGETHERWHEN I DO. [KIM]: I LOVE THAT ONE. OH, LOOK AT THAT. THERE'S MY GRANDMOTHERBEFORE SHE ENLISTED. [PEGGY]:I'M STILL NOT CLEAR EXACTLY HOW YOU GUYS AREALL INVOLVED IN THIS. [KIM]: THIS IS HERWHEN SHE WAS A BABY. [RITA]: OH, WOW.SHE'S VERY PRETTY. SHE LOOKS A LOT LIKE MARY LOU. OH. SO, CAN YOU MAKEAN EXCEPTION? I MEAN, WE CAN PROVETHAT THE VASE IS OURS, AND YOU HAVE ME AND BUNNY, AND THAT'S TWO PROVEOUT OF THREE SIGNATURES. YES. HOWEVER, THE ACCOMPANYING LETTERWAS WRITTEN BY MARY LOU. I UNDERSTANDTHE URGENCY. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY... AN UNUSUALSET OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT-- OKAY. BUT... CAN YOU HELP USTRACK DOWN MARY LOU? WELL, FROM WHAT I HEAR, MARY LOU COULD BE ANYWHEREIN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. BUT YOU FOUND US. YOU MUST BE GOOD. I'VE GOT A CARD. SHE'S AN ASSOCIATE NEWS PRODUCERAT A NEWS AGENCY IN NEW YORK. SHE'S NEVER ACTUALLY THERE,BUT IT'S A START. COULD YOU JUST TRY? PLEASE? EVEN IF IT ENDS UP BEINGTOO LATE FOR THE AUCTION, THE TRUTH IS... IT MIGHT JUST BE ENOUGHTO BRING MARY LOU HOME... IN TIME FOR MOM. [KIM]: OH, HERE IT IS. [RITA]: OLIVER, LOOK! THIS IS BETTYON HER WEDDING DAY. THERE SHE IS, THERE'S HER HUSBAND,OHOLDING THE VASE,. AND THEIR COMMANDING OFFICERWHO MARRIED THEM.

WOULDN'T IT BE SOMETHINGIF IT TURNS OUT SHE'S RIGHT? YES. YES, IT WOULD. SO, IS THAT WHAT YOU NEEDED? YOU KNOW, WE... WE'LL HAVE TO COMPARE THIS VASE WITH THE ONE WE HAVEAT THE OFFICE. COULD WE TAKE THIS WITH US? OR PERHAPS GET A COPY OF IT? I HAVE A COPIER IN THE BACK. PERFECT. I HAVEHERE, SWEETHEART.BACK. THANKS. WE NEED TO LEAVE. HEY! I MILKED MY FIRST COW! OH! WOW!

WELL, THE VASE IS WORTHA LOT OF MONEY, RIGHT? MOST LIKELY. AND THE PEOPLE IT BELONGS TOREALLY NEED THE MONEY? REALLY, REALLY NEED IT. THE QUESTION IS,DOES IT REALLY BELONG TO THEM? WELL, WHEN I SAWTHE FRENCH FLAG IN THE PICTURE, I REMEMBERED A COURSE I TOOKIN COLLEGE ABOUT THE ART THAT WENT MISSINGTHE FDURING WORLD WAR II.CTURE, SOME OF IT WAS STOLENDURING THE GERMAN OCCUPATION FROM MUSEUMS OR PRIVATE HOMES, AND THEN IT WAS SOLD,OR TRADED, OR HIDDEN AWAY.

AND YOU THINK THIS COULD BE ONE OF THOSESTOLEN PIECES OF ART? WELL, IF IT'S FROM EUROPEAFTER THE WAR AND IT'S AS VALUABLEAS WE THINK IT COULD BE, THEN THERE'SA VERY, VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT IT BELONGEDTO ANOTHER FAMILY... THAT IT WAS TAKEN FROM.
