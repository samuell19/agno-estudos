POTTER: Howard. HOWARD: Potter, what are you doing here? Be calm, relax, have a drink. Let him bring up business. It's all set. All I have to do is sign the papers. Let him bring up the papers. If there are problems, say you have to check with your lawyer and call me. - Potter, it's only a promotion. - Only a promotion? That's only the start. - Howard, take a look at this building. - Yeah. If there's a God, Howard, he probably lives in this building. Now, this is a big step for you. From now on, it's all uphill. Is that the only tie you have? No, it's not... It's the only one I brought. Really... Now these guys are very touchy about details. - Have you told Phyllis? - No, I called home. Line was busy. All right. Don't worry, don't worry, you can call them from his place. These guys usually have phones on every table. You sure you don't want me to go with you? - He said for me to drop by alone. - Fine. You're right. You're right. Now, you gotta start getting used to doing things alone. Come on, I'll take you inside. Come on. Howard Brubaker to see Mr. Theodore Gunther. Yes, sir, 20E. - Third bank of elevators to the left. - Thank you. Okay, Howard, this is it. You're on your own. Thanks a lot, Potter. Forget it, kid. Very important client. Great setup you got here. [RINGS] [DOOR OPENS] - What do you think of this? - Hm? - Yeah, Brubaker, Howard, isn't it? - Yes, sir. Yes. What does it say to you? Oh, uh, it's... Shouldn't there be something on it? The less that's on it, the more that's in it. That's art today. In any case, the safe response is: "It makes its own quiet statement." And you can bet your ass it cost me a bundle. Come on, I've got some beautiful people I want you to meet. [CHATTERING] [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS] Is, uh, that the only tie you have? Well, actually, I have others, but not with me. Don't worry, just let them know you're on the street. Well, hello there. Gunther's the name. Can I buy you a drink? [CHATTERING] WOMAN: I don't know, darling. The trouble is, you think she's Italian. [LAUGHING] Oh, God. Yeah, I didn't know it was a party. GUNTHER: This is a little something I picked up in Paris. The moment I saw it, I knew I had to own it. I don't think a day goes by that I don't spend at least five minutes looking at it. Yeah, excuse me. Hello, angel. It looks like it will be one of our best parties. I hope so. [GUESTS CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] [WOMAN LAUGHING] This, of course, is the famous Ravenberry Phone Booth. Reality of reality. I'll show you over here something I... [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Oh, that's wonderful. GUNTHER: Oh, Les. Leslie. Nice of you to come. You look great, guy, huh? Your place looks just marvelous. MAN: I know fabric. This is an honest cloth. An intelligent cloth. WOMAN 1: Listen to him. It's his business. WOMAN 2: He's the playboy and the jet-setter. [WOMEN LAUGHING] Baseball is down, basketball is down. Football is peaking. Where are the people gonna go next? - Tennis. - Hockey. Hockey. GUNTHER: Perfect symbol of the climate of violence. Twelve angry men on skates with sticks. Just you think about that. - Yeah. Well, l... It sounds to me like... - Gunther's the name. Buy you a drink? [GUESTS CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Sensitivity training is not limited to only those people who think they need it. Heh. Les, for example, could hardly be called insensitive. [LESLIE GIGGLES] Les is right, Cath. STANLEY [ON PHONE]: Hello? OPERATOR: Hello. I have a collect call from a Mr. Brubaker in New York City. - Will you accept the charges? STANLEY: No. Stan, it's me, Daddy. Yoo-hoo. Sta... [LINE CLICKS] OPERATOR: I'm sorry, sir, but your party has refused to accept the charges. Yeah, it's my son. He's going through a phase. I don't understand it. Would you put the call through again? Person to person? Do you, uh, type? You mean, uh, with a machine? PHYLLIS [ON PHONE]: Hello? Phyllis, we've got to do something about Stan. That's the third time this week he's hung up on me. His teacher says it's perfectly natural. Stanley's television-oriented, so he's frustrated by voices he can't see. They're conducting a study at Princeton. Good, as long as they're working on it. Listen, I got big news. Gunther's made me head of the Investment Department. Phyllis, did you hear me? I heard you, Howard. Well, you don't sound very happy. Heh, I'm happy, Howard. We'll just have to find a new house. What's wrong with the new house we got last month? I can't talk, Howard, I've got to change. The girls are coming over. [LINE CLICKS] Mm-hm. Heh-heh. [GUESTS CHATTERING] [WOMAN LAUGHING] [MAN PLAYING "I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER" ON PIANO] [SINGING] The moment I wake up Before I put on my makeup I say a little prayer for you While combing my hair now And wondering what dress To wear now I say a little prayer for you Forever and ever You'll stay in my heart And I will love you Forever and ever We never will part Oh, how I love you Together, together That's how it must be To live without you Will only mean heartbreak for me Mm, yeah. I run for the bus, dear - While riding I think of us, dear - While riding I think of us, dear - I say a little prayer for you - I say a little prayer for you At work, I just take time And all through My coffee break time I say a little prayer for you - Forever... - Forever and ever You'll stay in my heart And I will love you Forever and ever We never will part Oh, how I love you Together, together That's how it must be To live without you Will only mean heartbreak for me Ooh, yeah. [GUESTS CHATTERING AND LAUGHING LOUDLY] [CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] [CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Brubaker's the name. Buy you a drink? Fine. I'll get my things. - Oh, Brubaker? HOWARD: Huh? This is Naomi. We're gonna be seeing a lot of her. Brubaker. You all right? Yeah, I just met this girl and she's getting her things. You got one. Good man. - Where are you gonna take her? - I don't know. Home, I guess. Home? To your wife? No, I mean her home. Wherever she lives. Wrong. Here, drop by the old club. It's like a second home. Oh, I don't know if that would be quite a... Brubaker, handle her case. [CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Leaving so soon? CATHERINE: I'm sorry. Hi. This thing makes its own quiet statement. I think there should be something on it. [HOWARD SNIFFS] I don't mean to sound too forward, my name is Catherine. Oh, uh... Um, Brubaker... Howard. - Brubaker? - Mm. How do you do? I never know what to say in an elevator. Heh-heh-heh. It's... It's some party, huh? "Some party" good or "some party" bad? Uh, well... Well... Well, some good and some bad. On the average, for that type of party, I'd say it was average. You go to a lot of these? No, actually. I expect I will be going to quite a few of them in the future though. I got a little promotion today. Actually, a big promotion. - I'm on the street, you see. - On the street? You interested in stocks and bonds? - No. - Generally, I think we can expect a good year. Very bullish overall. There's a possibility of some bearishness later on, but I think... [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Do you, uh, live in the city? - Yes. - Whereabouts? - Here. Oh, well, that makes it convenient. I'll get us a taxi. Can I help you, Mrs. Gunther? Yes, I'd like a taxi. [BELL RINGS] Cab! Hey, cab! Cab! Cab! Hey, cab. I guess he didn't see me. I thought we'd, uh, pop over to the old club, huh? - Fine. - Good. What old club did you have in mind? Uh... Safari Club. [GROWLS] HOSTESS: Welcome to the Club Safari. You are now in the Jungle Room. Dancing and entertainment are in the Native's Quarter on the second floor. The Campfire Buffet is on your left. Please shoot the waitress of your choice for service. Happy hunting. [HOSTESS CLICKS TONGUE THEN HOWARD CLICKS TONGUE] Do you come here often? Uh, no. Actually, no. But I think I will, because my boss says it's like a second home. Heh. He must live in a zoo. Heh-heh. Uh, what would you like to drink? Uh... A double... A double anything. A double... I'm sorry. I meant to shoot... Where did she go? Her. Uh... I never was very good with animals. I've got this dog that barks at me when I come home. Well, it isn't as strange as it sounds. He came with the house, belonged to the former owner. He doesn't know that I'm his master. He thinks I'm a prowler, so he barks, awf. [HOWARD CHUCKLES] [LION ROARS] I'll get... Listen. About that house. It's in Darien, Connecticut, and I don't live alone there with a dog. You see, there's this, uh, woman who hangs around too. And a kid, Stanley. A boy. What I'm... I'm sort of married. How wonderful. I don't live alone either. You don't live alone either... You're married too? Yes. Oh, ho-ho. Well, I'll be... Can you...? You don't look married. Thank you. Well, you don't look very married neither. Yeah? Well, thank you. Heh-heh. I should. Twelve years. Twelve years. We've lived in 12 different houses too. Hm. You must travel a lot. Oh, no. That's just because my wife has this remodeling thing. When she finishes a house, she gets bored, so we gotta get a new one and start over from the beginning. She's very home-oriented, as she would put it. But I guess aside from that, I'm pretty ha... - How about you? - Oh, I'm not as happy as you are. No? Well, how come? Oh, I take it back. It's none of my business. I'm sorry. Um... - Any children? - No. My husband doesn't like children. Huh? He thinks they're too childish. [CHUCKLES] Where's...? I'm sorry, I forgot. What's the matter with these waitresses? Oh, can we have a double anything? - Is your name Brubaker? - Hm? Telephone for you, sir. Telephone for me? Oh. I wonder... Uh, would you excuse me? [PARROT SQUAWKS] Uh, hello? Hello? GUNTHER [ON PHONE]: Brubaker. How stands the union? Hello... What? Oh, Mr. Gunther. Hi. What's your diagnosis, doctor? Is your patient showing a fever yet? Is my patient? What...? Oh, you mean, uh... Well, she's a very nice girl. We're getting along just fine. Good boy. Don't let her know you're married. Heh. Uh... I'll see you in the morning. Right. Don't let her know I'm married. [GUN POPS] I am married. [GUNS POPPING] [WHOOPING AND LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] MIMSY: I had no idea what to expect. He just said, "Wanna hear some funny tapes?" I heard it was all her idea. We've known them for years. I never imagined they were like that. [PHONE RINGS] STANLEY: I'll get it. I'll get it. Oh, if that's Bob, tell him the maid drank it. - Hello? - Stanley? It's me, Daddy. Don't hang up. All right? Could I speak to Mommy, please? What did they say about the tapes? Phyllis? Can you hear me, Phyllis? [GROWLS THEN BARKS] Oh, I've got the dog. - Hello? - Phyllis, look, I wanted to call and tell you I missed the 8:01. I'll be on the 9:57 that gets in at 11:14. Howard, you're too time-oriented. You've gotta learn not to be so dependent on your rigid schedule. This isn't my schedule. The New York, New Haven and Hartford puts this out. I can't talk now. I've gotta serve. [LINE CLICKS] Phyllis? Phyllis? My boss. Big deal coming up. Bullish and rubbish? - Bearish. - Oh, yes. He's quite a swinger. Oh, yes? It was his idea for us to come here. I've... This is not my kind of place. And I just don't think you're the sort of girl that, uh... I didn't know what to say to him. Well, the next time you see him, why don't you just...? [GUN POPS] Yes, sir, what can I bring you? [LAUGHS] HOWARD: Um... Shall we...? Just the check, please. But you didn't order anything. We haven't ordered... Well, then we're straight. CATHERINE: Thank you. Bwana want a taxi? - Bwana want a...? You want a taxi? - No. I think I'll walk for a while. You know, I don't wanna leave, but I just, uh... I missed the train, and l... It's late, and I don't know when I'll get... Oh, she worries about you? No, one thing about, uh... She doesn't worry about me. I did promise you a drink, didn't I? Do you dance? - Do I dance? - Yes. - No. - Ah. [THE CHAMBERS BROTHERS' "WAKE UP" PLAYS] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CALIFORNIA'S "SUGAR KITE" PLAYS] Thank God. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Catherine, how are you? CATHERINE [ON PHONE]: I'm fine. - Great. Absolutely, it's the best party we've ever had. Listen... Hey, where are you? Where do you think I am? Catherine, this is no time for jokes. We're giving a party for 200 people. I've been gone for hours. Didn't you notice? Of course I noticed. Just a little while ago, I asked what's-his-name, "Where is Cathy?" I'll talk to you later. [CHATTERING] [POP MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS] [PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS] WOMAN: Are you a Gemini? Yes. How did you know? A lucky guess. You should trust your emotions more. Stop thinking so much. I guess weights too. What is his sign? He's Taurus. You're wildly incompatible. Of course, there's nothing to astrology, but he's much too acquisitive for you. Wants to own everything he sees. What about him? I'd say he was the Crab. Affectionate, shy, sensitive. You two could be very compatible. [CATHERINE SPEAKS IN FRENCH] - Are you from Paris? - Yes. How wonderful. You should come and meet my husband. He's a displaced Parisian. [MOUTHS] Catherine! [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [TAJ MAHAL'S "GIVE YOUR WOMAN WHAT SHE WANTS" PLAYS] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CHUCKLING] I'm sorry, I'd like to, uh... But, uh, the last... - I understand. - It leaves... GRACE: Children, I'm afraid I'm in terrible difficulty. And he was doing so well. Almost three months without a drop. ORLOW: Seventy-four days, 10 hours and seven minutes. A new world's record. And the new world's record holder is Orlow P. Walters. GRACE: And I can't drive. I don't suppose you'd reconsider? [HORN HONKING] Your friends and neighbors have chipped in to buy you a small token of esteem and affection. [GEARS GRATING] Gears need a little oiling, I guess. Brubaker, do you duel? Uh, no, I tried out for the college fencing team, but I... Splendid. Are you getting tired? No, I'm fine. [YELLS] [CRASHING] Hello, darling. Hello, my love. I've found us some guests. Catherine and Brubaker. How do you do? Catherine is from Paris. And he was college fencing champion. Oh, marvelous. Delighted. [ANDRE AND CATHERINE SPEAKING IN FRENCH] Catherine, we'll freshen up. Fine. Uh, Brubaker and I will just try our hand. [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] ANDRE: Foil or ?p?e? You must forgive this equipment, but, uh, I'm just learning. Marvelous sport, don't you think? - Oh, yes. - Illegal now, so I only practice at night. As a matter of fact, I only do everything at night. - Actually, I wasn't a fencing champ. ANDRE: Oh-oh. I found out long ago that all of the most unpleasant things in life occur during the day. The sun beats down, women wear curlers. Men jam subways to get to offices where they cheat each other in business, or borrow and lend money at exorbitant rates. Say, I hope I'm not stepping on any toes. - What line are you in? - I'm on the street. Oh. Oh, well, I'm sure you'll find something soon. And this is my favorite room. I feel like I've stepped into the past. - Lots of luck. - But at night, ah, the stock exchange is closed. The moon comes up. Candles flicker. Champagne pops. Women are gay and beautiful. Greta Garbo movies are on television. So obviously, the answer is to sleep during the day and live at night. En garde. Uh-huh. [YELLS IN JAPANESE] That's Japanese, you know. Not completely fair, I suppose, but, uh, in dueling, Brown tells me, anything goes. [YELLS IN JAPANESE] [GRUNTING] Wonderful attack. Well, thank you, but actually... [BOTH YELLING] Do you believe in destiny? No. I mean, not really. Good. Then I'll tell your fortune. - I don't really believe in... - Neither do I. It's bad luck to be superstitious, but the cards are so pretty. [ANDRE YELLS IN JAPANESE THEN HOWARD GROANS] HOWARD: Aa-ah! Now, the first card represents your picture of yourself. Oh, my. The Fool. Are you feeling foolish? A little. You see, there's a party in my apartment right now, and I should be there, but I walked out with Brubaker. And for some reasons, I don't care. - I'm here, I'm happy and... - Oh, you don't look very happy. Did your husband beat you? How did you know I was married? By your wedding ring. How else? [CATHERINE CHUCKLES] CATHERINE: Yes, of course. [ANDRE YELLS IN JAPANESE] HOWARD: Oh! [ANDRE YELLS IN JAPANESE] ANDRE: Oh, permit me. - En garde. - Oh! [GRUNTING] GRACE: The future. Mm. The World. This may mean that you're about to make a decision and all choices are open to you. Or it could mean that you're about to take a trip. - Are you planning one? - No. You see? It's all foolishness. I've been thinking about... About leaving my husband. You see how these games can get out of hand? I thought about it for a long time. Are these from your wedding cake? GRACE: When Andre and I were married, they had just invented bread. [CHUCKLES] When we got married, people said we looked more perfect than the figures on the cake. Two pretty people, but that's not enough. Well, I suppose there are times when a trade-in is permissible. Then you think I should leave him? No one should ever give advice. Why don't you leave it up to the cards? You have one left in your future. [HOWARD GRUNTING AND ANDRE YELLING IN JAPANESE] Excellent, but that makes you vulnerable for... ... un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq. [LAUGHS] Magnificent. A fine match. That was fun. Yeah. Heh-heh. Fun. That was fun. It was a lot of fun. This is some place. If my wife ever got her hands on this... - Brubaker? - Hm? Why do people get married? I don't know. Uh... They do. You know there's a marriage in this country every five seconds? CATHERINE: So fast? - They probably use computers. CATHERINE: I would like to live in a castle. HOWARD: All alone? CATHERINE: No, with a prince. - I was a prince once. - Heh-heh-heh. No, in kindergarten in this play. I mean, I played a prince who was turned into a frog by a wicked witch. And the only way I could get un-frogged was by the kiss of this beautiful princess. When it came time for the girl who was playing the princess to give me the kiss, she must've thought I looked terrible. I had this frog's head on at the time. She just walked off-stage, and, uh, it became the story of the enchanted frog who stayed a frog. [HOWARD CHUCKLES] You are a prince. That's the first time in years I've kissed a woman without saying "goodbye," "good night" or "happy birthday." Well, I say it's the first time I've kissed a man who didn't kiss me first. I really should, uh... - Forget it. - No, no. What were you going to say? I was gonna say something I thought I should, but I didn't really mean it. - Tonight... - No. Tonight we only say what we really mean. And do what we really wanna do. [CATHERINE SINGING IN FRENCH] [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] Well, the sun will come up any time now. Will you spend the day? Oh, uh... No, I'm af... I think we'd better be going. You'll come again, won't you? Thank you. We will. [ANDRE AND CATHERINE SPEAK IN FRENCH] Your friend is a good sport. [HOWARD CHUCKLES THEN STAMMERS] [ANDRE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE THEN CHUCKLES] I'm going to leave him. When? Today. Tonight. As soon as I can. If I wait too long, he'll talk me out of it. Where will you go? Home. Paris. HOWARD: Hm. I've never been to Paris. You'd like it. It's very romantic. Look, I don't know how to put this. This has been the most wonderful night of my life. I know that sounds... And if I had any... I guess it's back to being a frog again, as usual. You are a prince. Permanently. I've gotta go. Have a good trip. You too. To... Where is it you have all those houses? Oh, Darien. That's not exactly Paris. [ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS] Goodbye. We seem to say a lot of goodbyes. Too many. [SIGHS] [PIGEONS COOING] [FROG CROAKING] NAOMI: Hi. Hi. I'm supposed to be your new secretary. We met last night. At the party. Oh, sure, yes. You're the one with the... How are you? Tired. Me too. Heh-heh. Want a pill? - What kind of pill? - You tell me. No, thank you. Would you get my wife on the phone? Sure. Uh, what's your name? Brubaker, Howard. Is that what you want me to call you? Well, yeah, you can call me Mr. Bru... Howard. Actually, whatever you want. Good. I'm used to working for swingers. [INTERCOM BUZZES] - Yes? NAOMI: Your wife, Bru. Bru? Oh, she... Phyllis? I've got something important we have to talk about. Howard, I'm so glad you called. A realtor is bringing a couple over this morning to look at the house. If they like it, they wanna move in - right away. - Right away? They have another house we can take temporarily. Of course, it needs a lot of work. - Have you seen your new office yet? - Yes, I'm in it now. How many windows are there? L... Eleven. Eleven? I'll come down on Monday and see what I can do. Gunther say anything about refurnishing it? No. Why, you should see it, it's barely... Look, Phyllis, please. I must talk to you about something very important. Well, just ask him. Oh, Phyllis... Howard, don't be afraid. You've got it coming to you. - You're so avoidance-oriented. - Phyllis... The Cranshaws can't make it. - They're sick. - Phyllis... But if we can find a recorder, they'll send over their tapes. What tapes? [DOORBELL RINGS] There's the realtor. I can't talk now. Thank you for calling. [DOOR OPENS] Well, Brubaker, what do you think of it? Well, it's not exactly the Palace of Versa... Good Lord, what happened? Did you get mugged? Oh, no, no. I just haven't had a chance to shave and change. A little celebration is expected, Brubaker, but in moderation. - I have these contracts here... - Mr. Gunther, I'm giving notice. - Your notice of what? - I'm quitting. You'll get my resignation in the mail. I'd like to tell you it's been... Brubaker, I've known of men to crack from the strain of life at the top, but never after one day. It's been a pleasant association, and my decision does not reflect personally on anyone, it's just that I've made other plans. What other plans? Suicide? What are you talking about, Brubaker? Well, since you... As a matter of fact, you were instrumental in this thing. Here, by the way. Thank you very much. Uh, you know the girl I met at your party last night? She's leaving her husband. And I've decided I am gonna go with her, if she'll let me, to Paris tonight. Brubaker, is this just alcohol? Or are you on drugs too? No, I know it sounds strange, but I'm perfectly serious. I wanted to tell you that's it's been a wonderful association and that my decision does not reflect personally on anyone. All right, if you wanna go and bundle with this tootsie... She's not a tootsie. She's a very beautiful, wonderful girl. Okay, Brubaker. If you wanna go bundle with this wonderful, beautiful girl, take one week of your vacation now... Wait, you don't understand. I'm not coming back. Mm-mm. Brubaker. A girl you meet at one of my parties? A drunken kiss, an off-balance embrace, a couple of hours in the downy billows? You don't understand. It was nothing like that. See, she's... She's a princess and I'm a frog who got changed into a prince. - Brubaker... - I was a prince at first. - That's enough. - I got changed into a frog, and until her kiss... - Brubaker, you are not a frog. - Right. As cruel as this may seem in your current state, I want you to recognize that as the truth. I'm not a frog now. I'm a prince, but I was a frog. Brubaker, repeat this simple sentence after me. "I am not now, nor have I ever been a frog." - No... - Repeat, Brubaker. "I am not now, nor have I ever been a frog." HOWARD: Mm-mm. Brubaker, you need some rest. You also need to consult a doctor. Either a psychiatrist or a veterinarian. DOORMAN: May I help you? - Uh, yes. I was here this morning, you know, a few hours ago, with a girl. A woman. A blond. She was wearing a tuxedo. Do you remember? Mrs. Gunther, 20E. Mrs. Gunther. [WATER RUNNING] [DOORBELL RINGS] [WATER STOPS RUNNING] [DOORBELL RINGS] My friend and I have decided to go with the princess, if she'll have us. Did you arrange for this? I wish I had. How do you think we look? - Foolish, I guess. - I hope so. [MUSIC STOPS] HOWARD: You were happy as a child, weren't you? CATHERINE: Yes, I was. - Weren't you? HOWARD: Yeah. Don't you have any rotten childhood stories? No, I don't. - Do you? - No. Heh. When I was 10, my grandmother gave me a goldfish bowl. And I saved up all my money, and I ran down to the pet shop, and I bought two goldfish. The man put them in a carton like you eat Chinese food out of. He was eating Chinese food out of a carton just like it. I brought them home, and I opened the carton very carefully and I poured it in, and it turned out to be chop suey. Because the man had given me the wrong carton by mistake. Heh. I was sitting there staring at all these noodles and vegetables floating around and my father walked in. He looked at it and said, "What's that?" And I said, "That's chop suey." And he said, "Well, remember, your mother and I aren't gonna feed it for you." [BOTH LAUGHING] [BARKING] [LAUGHING] [CHATTERING] I don't think Webster has another year left in him. Better put him on the block. Buy someone to back up Ferroski. And... Well, gentlemen, it appears we have our first fan. Anyone know who she is? Never saw her before. New one to me. Well, I think this calls for an official welcome. If you'll excuse me. GUNTHER: Gunther's the name. Buy you a drink? Oh, it's you. Hi, Potter. - My God, Howard, you look terrible. - What, I do? Yeah, I guess I do. Scotch and water. I feel wonderful. Met a girl last night, we're going to Paris. - What about Phyllis? - She's not coming. Handle it. That's why I wanted to see you. Give her anything. Car, house. - A divorce? - Yeah. - What about your promotion? - Oh, I quit. Which is probably just as well because the girl turned out to be Gunther's wife. Heh. - Gunther's wife? - Cheers. Last night, you didn't know what tie to wear, and now you're running off with the boss' wife. You better listen to me, Howard. You know what I think? You're moving too fast. - Better get ahold of yourself. Relax. - I am relaxed. All my life, I've been tense and never knew it. Potter, I met this girl and I came alive. I laughed with her. I really laughed, and I made her laugh. And we danced and I dueled. I dueled. [IMITATES ANDRE SPEAKING IN JAPANESE] - And I bought her a frog. Heh. - Howard, you're hysterical. - Heh-heh. - Better have a drink. Two more. [CHATTERING] Well, what are you doing here anyway? I came to talk to you. - Can we go somewhere private? - What's the matter with right here? I own the place. It's as private as our own home. Yeah, I guess it is. That's the problem. We're so public. Our life, our friends. That apartment. There may be things wrong with our life and our friends, but there's nothing wrong with that apartment. I've got over $300,000 in that little hovel. It's a goddamn showplace. Didn't you hear people talking about it? Well, I left early. That's right. Where the hell did you go anyway? No, I know. Don't tell me. You had one of your romantic fits and you went walking in the park looking for wounded birds. Let me tell you something, this is New York City, and any girl who goes walking alone at night in the park is not romantic, she's crazy. You know what can happen? I'm sorry but we can't talk here. I'm leaving. - You're leaving for where? - Paris. Paris. Paris? Why is suddenly everybody going to Paris? Is there a party? First this maniac in my Investment Department who thinks he's a tadpole, now you. What has come over everybody? Just when I'm feeling good, you decide to drop it on old Ted. Forget it. I'm not gonna let you do it. - I won't let you spoil my day. - I'm sorry... I don't wanna hear any apologies. MAN: Here, here. This day is too important to me. Just remember for the next time to have more respect for the other fellow's feelings. Potter, you're an unhappily married man. Well, can't you understand? Didn't you ever meet a girl that made you feel different? Yes. I never told this to anyone before. There was this girl. - Oh. - She was divorced. Her name was Barbara Jo Wilkerson. She was beautiful. Beautiful. She was suing her dentist. Her six-year-old son's dentist actually, and I was representing the dentist. I'll never forget the first thing I ever said to her. Yeah, what? What? What? Heh-heh. "Mrs. Wilkerson, my name is Potter Shrader and I'm Dr. Zimmerman's attorney." That's it? Oh. The first thing I said to Catherine, I said: "Hi. Brubaker's the name. Buy you a drink?" - You know what she said...? - Howard, Howard. - Howard, will you please let me finish? - Oh, yeah. Anyway, one thing led to another and for about three weeks, I was feeling the same way you're feeling now. I was gonna leave Mimsy and the twins. We were gonna run off to Wyoming and get married and raise horses. What do you know about horses? What do I know about the law? I was gonna read a book about it. Also, how to play guitar. Oh, you were gonna learn how to play? You see, we had this little story we'd act out. She was a saloon hostess and I was... I was the Sundance Kid who carried her off. I'm a frog and she's a princess. Yeah, I'd saunter into her saloon... We called it the Golden Garter. And I'd say, "Give me a double whiskey, please." - Right. - And she'd say: "Is that all you think about, Kid? Whiskey?" And l... See, I had a drinking problem in those days, and this was kind of good therapy for me. And I'd say: "Oh, no, little lady, I've got something else on my mind too." HOWARD: Yeah? And then she'd smile. Oh, my God, Howard, she had such beautiful teeth. Wonder why she never took her kid to her dentist. And then she'd say: "Oh, yeah? Well, show me, Kid." And then I'd... I'd... Oh, my God, Howard, you don't know what it can be like. I do. I've been trying to tell you. I've got it with this girl. I even prepared a speech for Mimsy. It was as long as a brief. I memorized the key words and wrote them down on index cards. The night I was gonna drop it on her, I called her into the room and I said: "Hold onto your hat." Then I reached into my pocket. Well, you know what they say, Howard. You never lose anything you don't really wanna lose. - Hm? - Mm. So the next day, I made out a new set of cards and dropped them on Barbara Jo. - It's not the same thing. - Have an affair with her. HOWARD: Will you shush? - There's nothing shameful. Maybe there is, but it's better than breaking up a family. Potter, this is not an affair. That's what Barbara Jo and I used to say. Don't you ever regret letting her go? Every time I see a horse. But there's certain things that a person has to sacrifice. Oh, I've been doing it, sacrificing for 12 years, 12 years. Only thing Phyllis and I talk about are the Hortons or the Cranshaws or carpenters and plumbers. Irv and Sally Plummer? We're having dinner with them tomorrow night. Well, I'm not. I'm going to Paris. You draw up the papers, give her everything, and I'll send you the address where you can send the bill. POTTER: Howard. Come back. Let's have a drink and talk this out. I haven't got time. I wanna see her again before we go. POTTER: Howard. HOWARD: Let go, Potter. POTTER: What will you do there? - How will you live? - I'll teach dueling. - Don't do it. - Let go! She's not worth it. You'll be sorry! Call Barbara Jo! - If you want to change your mind... - What, are you kidding? You don't wanna change your mind, do you? No. I feel very... Very certain. - You happy? - Yes. Me too. Yes. Well, I'll see you at the airport. Yes. [ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS] Goodbye. We do say a lot of goodbyes. [CHATTERING] Thank you. He didn't make it. You didn't do it, buddy. I knew you wouldn't do it, I knew. Could I have a Scotch and water? He was gonna run off with some French cookie. I told him not to do it. - Why not? - Huh? They were going to Paris. What's her name? - Who? - Your French cookie. I don't think that's any of your business. Oh, that's no attitude, pal. Just because she shot you down. Give your buddies a chance. She didn't shoot me down, and I'm not your buddy. - I don't know who he is. MAN 1: Scotch and water. Howard, this is Matt Benson. - Matt Benson, Howard Brubaker. - How do, pal? Now, what about this bimbo's number? She's not a bimbo, and I'm not gonna give you her number, and I am going to Paris tonight. Heh, sure, pal. That's what I tell them too. But this train only goes to New Haven. Hey, that's good. That's... Heh. This train only goes to New Haven. [LAUGHING] MAN 2: Let me have a Scotch on the rocks. You can't go to Paris in this train, buddy. This train only goes to New Haven. I'll tell you what, pal. I'll make you a trade. Gina Hernandez, half Basque, half Italian. I don't want any half-Basque Italians. This train doesn't go to Italy. Okay, I'm reasonable, pal. You wanna go to the A material, huh? - Okay. Heh-heh-heh. MAN 3: Make mine a rock and rye. Tabitha Sternowski, Greek and Polish. Belly dancer. Also yodels. [YODELING] Look, I... What's the use? Excuse me. BENSON: Unreasonable. Well, we'll have another smash and we'll talk about it, all right? I'll have another one here. This guy here. Make it a double. LESLIE: Oh, darling. - Dearest. Now the first thing I want everyone to do is to keep calm. Where's Cath? You poor kid. You know, when Les told me about this, I said: "I just don't believe it." I mean, if two guys like you and Ted can't make it, what hope is there for the rest of us? - Right, fella? CATHERINE: Mm. I'm sorry to cause all that trouble. - Trouble? Trouble? - Oh, trouble? How can there be any trouble between sensitive people who understand each other? Les is right, Cath. CONDUCTOR: Darien. Darien. [TRAIN WHEELS SQUEALING] All right, oh, here we are. - Dorinda Ustafian. HOWARD: Hm? Part Armenian, part Chinese. Knows rope tricks. No. Okay. Okay. Oh! Oh! Almida Van Hooten. Dutch and Byzantine. - Makes her own chocolate. - No, thank you. You don't understand. I'm going to Paris with this cookie. - This train don't stop at cookie. - I'm a reasonable guy. All right. All right. I'm gonna level with you, huh? I'm gonna tell you something that I have never told anybody in my life. Not even my analyst. - I've got a thing for foreign girls. - Yeah. It's probably because I don't get to do much traveling. Listen, you want my wife? She's from Iowa, but you get a couple of drinks in her, she can get pretty happy. LESLIE: Catherine, as your friend and neighbor, heh, and also as a concerned and sensitive person... Oh, Leslie, please leave me alone. I realize you're only doing what you think is best, but no one else knows what's best for anyone else. Oh, come on, guy. Les has helped a lot of fellas. Listen. If you touch me again, I'll give you a sock in the eye. Now get out of here, both of you. Ooh. Come on, sweetheart. Let's go down to the old courts, smack the old ball around a bit. Everybody thinks I'm with a client. - Know where I'm at? - No. A foreign movie. It doesn't even matter which country. CONDUCTOR: Bridgeport! - Bridgeport? I live in Darien. - I live in Stamford. - What about your pal? - Fairfield. Fairfield. That's right. Just give me a little nudge when we hit Fairfield. Third time this week I've missed it. I don't think they announce Stamford. Let me hear you call Stamford. CONDUCTOR: Bridgeport! BENSON: See what I mean? HOWARD: Come on. CONDUCTOR: Bridgeport. [TRAIN WHEELS SQUEALING] ANNOUNCER [OVER PA]: Your attention please. This is the 7:15 arriving at Bridgeport. This is the last stop. - No passengers... - Hey, 7:15 already. - It'll be almost 8 before I get home. - I gotta call her. Hey, watch him. Catherine? It's okay. We're gonna get a cab. Bridgeport. I missed my stop. It's all right, we'll get a taxi. - Let me talk to her. - Brubaker, are you all right? Hello, baby. This is Matt Benson. Don't worry. We're gonna get a taxi. Don't worry about anything. - Where do you work, sweetheart? CATHERINE: Brubaker? Brubaker? - I can't hear you. - What do you think of fried bananas? Everything is just fine. BENSON: Do you like? - This train don't stop at cookies. [LAUGHING] I know a nice Filipino joint. HOWARD: Don't worry. We'll get a taxi. BENSON: You work downtown, baby? I promise, I'm gonna tell Phyllis and everything will... Would you like some gum? Chocolate? American nylons? I won't be late. I'll see you at the airport, Catherine. Come on, get out of here. I've gotta get a cab. Taxi! [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] I'll write you from Paris. Thank you, Potter. Think nothing of it. Hey, there's Mimsy's car. Mimsy's here. We're gonna have dinner with you tonight. Let's go to dinner. - Look, you don't understand. DRIVER: What's happening? Will you keep the meter running? Hey, Benson! - Wait a minute! - Oh, let him go. Let's go to dinner, Benson. Dinnertime, buddy. Dinner. [BENSON SINGING INDISTINCTLY IN FRENCH] Where are you going? Shh. Back door. Give us a chance to freshen up a bit. Mimsy's got this thing about drinking. She thinks I'm an alcoholic. But there are a lot of stages of becoming an alcoholic. First, there's your morning drinker, then there's your secret drinker. Potter, watch out for the steps. We keep saying we're gonna fix... [CLATTERING] [BARKING] That must be Howard. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] POTTER: At a certain point, you reach a plateau where you become a problem drinker. Seriously, Howard, you don't think I drink too much, do you? I don't think you drink too much. Me and my goddamn ambition. That's all I think about. Well, a person can change. To hell with the money. We've got enough of that. Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna spend three days a week at home. We'll just lie around, listen to records. Get to know each other again. I don't want to lie around listening to records. Well, then we'll go out, sit in the park. Get drunk. Hang around the museums. Remember how it used be? Ted, please don't try to charm me. Charm? If that's what I have, I'll give it up. Everything I have means nothing to me without... Cathy, you want me to sell the Rockets? No, they're not standing between us. Twelve of the roughest, toughest men on ice. Sure champions. But I'll give them up just like that. No, it's too late. When there's no love... Love? What's love got to do with it? This is the 20th century. Last night I met two people and they are still in love after 35 years of marriage. It was in their eyes. And this afternoon, I saw what was in your eyes. It was surprise. No, it was disappointment. After two years of marriage, you were sorry it was me. Don't say that. Even if it's true, don't say that. - You know how bad it makes me feel. - Me too, but we have to face it. - We face it together. - No. Cathy, you remember the little blue apartment with the bed that squeaked? We had it once and if you've had it once, you never lose it. - It's like riding a bicycle, Cathy. - No. No. But that's not love. - Then what was it? - It was... It was attraction. Fine. Fine. I'll settle for that. Cathy, you attract me and I attract you. Don't deny it. You know it's true. Cathy, we chose each other. We married each other. - We need each other. - No, Ted. Please. Cathy, I need you more than anything. I know I don't show it, but it's true. Cathy, you're so beautiful. - Oh, no. Please, Ted, no. - Cathy. It's gonna be just like it was. Only better, much better. I promise you that. I swear it. [POTTER GRUNTING] Phyllis. I have something very important to discuss with you. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Okay, cards on the table time. I don't blame you for being angry. It's strange. Somehow I always knew that you'd find out about it. I must have been mad to risk losing you for... She really meant nothing. Just a mildly attractive dietician. I was worried about gaining weight and she had this exercise program. It only lasted a few weeks. What can I say? I'm weak. - How long have you known about it? - I didn't know. - You didn't? - No. But it doesn't matter. What do you mean it doesn't matter? Of course it matters. I just confessed here when I didn't have to. And you're still leaving? Yes. I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Wait just a damn minute. Now I understand. You're not playing with some fool, you know. I know a bit about human psychology. If you're not leaving because I have someone else, then you must have someone else. - Yes, but it's got nothing to do with us. - Ha-ha. I knew it. Who is it? I have a right to... Never mind. Don't tell me. I don't wanna know. The fact that there's somebody else is bad enough. To come all this way only to lose to someone else. I feel like Adlai Stevenson. You remember what he said in 1956? He said he was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh. Heh. Please, Ted. You didn't even vote for him. - You're a Republican. - Then I'll change parties. CATHERINE: You can't change my mind. GUNTHER: There must be a way. I'm not good with words. Tell me what to say, I'll say them. There aren't any words now. Only goodbye. What did he say? What did he tell you? He said I was a princess and he was a frog. GUNTHER: Brubaker! [BENSON SPEAKS IN FRENCH] [BENSON HUMMING] - Phyllis, I've got to talk to you. - Hm? Congratulate me, Howard. - Why...? What...? - I sold the house. Forty-eight five. The realtor has the check, the tenants are moving in next week. And, Howard, do you have any idea what you look like? Yeah. I was up all night. With whom? A woman? Yes. A girl that I met. And... Don't lie, Howard. We've known each other too long for that. MIMSY: I said, "Don't take more than one drink." You said to me, "Mimsy, I will not take more than one drink. I promise." Now, this is very unfair of you. Potter, I have warned you about this. [POTTER SNORING] Phyllis... Will you listen to me, Phyllis? I met this girl at the party, and we got along very well, - and, well, she's married too, but... - Did you get her name? Yes. Catherine. Good. We'll have them over as soon as we're settled. "We'll have them over as soon as..." I don't think you understand, Phyllis. [BENSON HUMMING] MIMSY: Potter, get this drunk off me! That drunk is my friend. Don't be cross. I can't stay for dinner because I'm going to Paris tonight. I've quit my job and I'm leaving. Phyllis, I'm leaving everything. Okay. I'd hoped to tell you this under more pleasant circumstances. I didn't wanna use it as a way to make you stay against your will. What are you talking about? Well, Cathy, it's not just the two of us that we have to consider anymore. Well, why? We're going to have a baby. You know how many divorces I handle a week? And every time, I say: "Oh, Lord, this time, let it be mine." MIMSY: I forbid you to go near the twins in your present condition. Our marriage is a bust. It's been in big trouble for years. I thought we'd discussed that, Howard, and we decided it was not my fault. She forbids me. She forbids me. Me, the master of the house. The husband, the man, the lawyer. The alcoholic. Half the time, we're arguing, the other half, we don't speak. On the average, we're compatible. On the average, our life is one big empty blech! Oh, speak for yourself, Howard. I happen to lead a very full and active life. I have my house work, remodeling, Stanley, community activities, social functions, hobbies, intellectual pursuits. But no love. There is no love between us. I don't think we even like each other. Howard, you're too emotionally-oriented. Stanley, dinner. Dinner, everyone. His name is Andros. He's a little Greek boy who lives in Athens with his parents. I've subscribed to the full foster parents' plan, which is $250 a month. Whenever we go over to visit, we can see him. When he gets old enough, - he can write to us. - Ted, it's... I've been thinking about it for quite some time. This afternoon, I decided. The time had come. - Don't you wanna see his picture? - It's sweet, - but I don't consider a foster child... - Catherine. I can't believe it's you talking. Think of little Andros growing up in a broken American home without a foster mother on the very day that he's adopted. Ted, will you ask the driver to go a little faster, please? An alcoholic, huh? Well, I'll show you what this alcoholic's gonna do. I'm gonna drive Howard to Paris tonight myself. To Barbara Jo Wilkerson. Who's Barbara Jo Wilkerson? Somebody who loves an alcoholic. Let's go, buddy. It's Paris time. [BENSON SINGING IN FRENCH] [GROWLING] PHYLLIS: Howard. [POTTER GRUNTING] If you go out that door now, you can consider it a trial separation. POTTER: Come on. I'll drive. It's 9:00. Can you make it? Are you kidding? Are you kidding, buddy? You're still saying no to me and little Andros? Ted, you're shouting. You're saying no to me and yes to that maniac? Ted, please. You're shouting. I know I'm shouting! I like to shout! What's the matter? Doesn't Brubaker ever shout? Look out! [TIRES SCREECHING] Potter! Take it easy, Howard. Easy does it. The French are a very relaxed people. You sure you don't want me to drive? POTTER: I don't even wanna discuss it. Just relax and leave the driving to us. Right, Benson? My coat. Your coat what? It's caught in the door. My hand too, I think. - Well, open it up. - No! WOMAN [OVER PA]: Announcing Flight 14 now arriving at Gate 8. Passengers arriving from Flight 14, you may now claim your luggage at the baggage claim area. [TIRES SCREECHING] Trans World Airlines announces the departure of Flight 83 from New York City to Kansas City. GUNTHER: Can't you check him? CATHERINE: No, he's going with me. Potter! CATHERINE: Reservation for Mrs. Gunther, Flight 850. - Thank you. - Do you have to go tonight? Couldn't you make it tomorrow? Look, we could go out and have some dinner at our funny little Italian place. We don't have a funny little Italian place. We don't? But... Then we'll find one. Everyone should have a funny Italian place at a time like this. - You're just acting... - I know. I know. I'm a sore loser. I always have been. That's why I'm a big winner. Cathy. Do you understand, Cathy? Thank you, Mrs. Gunther. You're boarding now. Thank you. [TIRES SCREECHING] [CLATTERING] WOMAN [OVER PA]: Boarding now, Flight 710. Mrs. Price. Mrs. Jessica L. Price. Please use the nearest courtesy phone. Mrs. Price... This is the final call for Flight 19. Now ready for departure at Gate 9. POTTER: We'll get you there, buddy. - We'll get you there. - Keep your eye on the road. MAN [OVER PA]: Will Mr. Howard Brubaker please report to Gate 8? POTTER: We'll get you there. BENSON: We're gonna make it. [IMITATES ENGINE REVVING] Look out, fella. MAN [OVER PA]: Will Mr. Howard Brubaker please report to Gate 8? [SPEAKS IN JAPANESE] POTTER: We'll get you there. [GRUNTING] POTTER: Go, go, go. [POTTER AND BENSON SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [BENSON SPEAKS IN SPANISH] ATTENDANT: Hello.
