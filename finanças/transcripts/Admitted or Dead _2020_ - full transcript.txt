Please just, just let me go. Shut up! I never meant to get involved. I'll keep it quiet, I promise. I just, I want to go home. Too late for that now. Your SAT score from your first test is above-average, so you have plenty of decent options. I don't want just decent though. I really want to go to the college I've already picked out and I was thinking Pine State for film school. I have a friend going and it's where we both really want to go. Your score might not be competitive enough for the bigger schools like Pine State. Your math is weak. It's never really been my strong suit. Well, there are some smaller places here in Portland that have great film programs. That's just not really my plan though. My best friend Katie and I have been planning to go to Pine together for, for years, like since elementary school. Well, maybe if you study really hard before the next test, you'll get your score up. That would really help. Hey, doll. Thought you fell off the face of the earth last night. Sorry, I feel asleep face deep in a practice test. Had a nightmare about trigonometry. Well, if that's not a sign you're stressing too much. Hey, speaking of which, you on for a party on Friday? I'm getting birthday cake vodka. Uh, I have my retake for the SAT on Saturday morning, so no, I am not going out on Friday. You're smart, you'll be fine. Have you even checked the averages for admissions? Must have done okay, because I heard I got in. Oh my God, Katie, you got into Pine? I know! It's pretty cool. It was some early decision or something. How? My mom knows someone in admissions. I wish my mom was famous. If I don't bring my score up, the closest thing I'll come to joining you at college is working at the campus Starbucks. Wait a minute, that's genius. If you work there, think of all the free coffee I'd get. You suck. Hey, it's going to be okay. Don't be bummed out. Thing is we are going to college and the party on Friday. It's a no to the party. Come on! I heard Nathan's going, like for sure. How'd you hear that? I may have invited him. Katie! Let's grab coffee after theater class. That way you can use it as an exploratory thing into your future career. Hey, you're not funny, but yes to the coffee 'cause I need the caffeine. Whoa there. Don't want to injure yourself before you even finish the season. Thanks, Nathan. I, uh, guess this was too much of a workout for me. How's it going? Uh, okay, considering. I don't know how you do it. I get so bored doing homework, let alone studying for the SAT. So, uh, Katie told me you're going to the party on Friday. She told you me you were going. You know I knew she was up to something. It doesn't sound like you want to go. No, no, I do, I guess. It's just if she gets wild, I know I'll either be stuck there or looking at a crazy Uber bill. And I know I want to bail early to be ready for the SAT Saturday morning. Well, it would be great if you go. And we can share an Uber if you decide to bail. Yeah, that's sounds like a deal. You will have a great career here. Perfect, thanks. Katie, that's not your coffee. Ugh, who does that? Laura got whole milk. You can't just take somebody's coffee. Shh. Do you hear that? It's the sound of someone who doesn't give a shh. Oh, hey... Come on, I want you to meet someone. Hey, guys. Dev, Si, this is my best friend, Anni. Nice to meet you, Katie's best friend, Anni. Hey. That's a nice car. Thanks. It was his 16th birthday present. Wow. I, uh, got a backpack. Dev and Si go to Eastwood. Football scholarships. Really? Football? What, you don't believe me? Oh no, I do, totally. It's just I guess I always thought football players were like these huge guys. Yeah, no, I'll prove it. -Oh no, that's okay. -No, no- -You don't have to. -No, look. That's me in high school before I got into college, but see, I'm a football player. That's impressive. Put it away, Si. What, I can't defend my honor to this lovely young woman? You're 18, right? Yes, she is. Well, it was lovely to meet you two. -I gotta go. -What? We can hang out. No, I gotta study. If you stay, he can give you a ride. I'll just get my mom to come pick me up. Algebra isn't that complicated when you break it down. It's just been so long since I've actually taken an algebra class. Well, look, excuse me, may I? Yeah. Uh, see this is kind of a trick question, but remember, the absolute values can't be negative because they represent the distance from zero on a number line. Right. Thanks. Are you a senior? You're not hitting on me, are you? Oh no, not at all. I'm sorry, did it seem that way? No, no, it's just, I've just had a very strange day today. Some football player from Eastwood University was hitting on me, so I just... Really? That's not cool. Yeah, yeah, and he just could not pick up on the fact that I was not interested in his fancy scholarship. He didn't even seem like a football player, really. I don't know how some guys get scholarships like that. Huh. So do you just really love math then? I guess you could say that. I work for a charity coaching students with the transition to college. I give advice on practice tests, admission essays, and schools that would be right for them. Help them get the most money possible in scholarships. Let me give you my card. Yeah. I'm Reilly. If you feel I can help you, don't hesitate to reach out. Honestly, I feel like I need all the help I can get. I'm just a call away. Thanks. Oh Mom, I met a guy today, some sort of tutor, he helps seniors with everything they need for college. A charity called Educating Youth. Do you think I could use him? We'll have to see how much he charges. I'm saving all I can to help you when you're at college. He said it was a charity though, and he already gave me some good advice. Well that's great honey, but I can help you, too. You've never even asked me for help. I know you can help me, but he is a professional. How'd your meeting with the school counselor go? It was okay. Meaning? Meaning my SAT score is above average, but my math sucks. It needs to be higher if I want to go to Pine, which means I need to well on the retake. Okay, I have an idea. Why don't we do a practice test together? I'm rusty, but I may still have it in me. Sure. Yeah, sure. Okay. Well, that's great. No, I can do the audition, it's just not the ideal role. Uh-huh. Thanks, Ben. Appreciate you setting it up. Hi, sweetie. I thought you had an audition or something. I do, it's tomorrow, so fingers crossed. You'll nail it. Someone asked me to play a grandmother the other day. Ouch. Yeah, I don't do grandmothers. -Not yet. -Ha, ha, very funny. If you weren't an only child, I'd kick you out. How was your day? How was school? Ah, same old. Hey Mom, did you check out that list of apartments I sent you? Hmm? They're close to campus and would be perfect for me and Anni. Uh-huh, I'll look. I'm really excited you two get to live together, and I'm really glad I can help. Yeah, uh, Anni just has to get in now. She's had trouble with her SAT and Pine State can be tricky, so I just wish it was easier for her. I bet a lot of your friends are stressed out. Yeah, I mean I wouldn't even want to go to college if Anni couldn't be there with me. Uh-huh, and I bet Anni really appreciates what a good friend you are. I just, I don't understand why I keep getting these questions wrong. It's okay, sweetie. Look, let's just take a break. Sometimes that's all that's needed. And your dad will be here shortly. I just get so frustrated and it just makes everything worse. I suck, I suck. Look, I know it's not much of a consolation, but this happens to everyone. All your friends go through this. It's stupid. I know it feels that way right now. Listen, you're going to do this. You're going to get into the college you want. You're going to get the grades you want, and you're going to go exactly where you and Katie planned to go. And no matter what, I'm proud of you. Hey, and I know your dad is too. -Okay. -Thank you. Okay, that's him, I got to go. Okay. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Have a good time with Dad. -Bye. -Bye. You're sure you're cool hanging in a place like this? Yeah, it kind of reminds me of a place I worked at in high school. Plus it's where all the cool people hang out. You're not calling yourself cool, are you? Should I? I mean I am a pretty cool guy. No, you're a dad. That's a good thing. Yeah, it's a great thing. How you been? I'm good. School is good. My friends are amazing. Mom is kind of stressing me out. Yeah, I remember the pressure. It's all the unknowns of what's coming up just makes it hard. Yeah, it's all the uh, the what are you going to do with the rest of your life kind of stuff. Yeah, I get it. The next decision's a big one. But hey, you're a Kerr, you're going to be fine. I mean, look at me. True. Crazy successful lawyer, living the dream, and to think it all started in a coffee shop. Exactly. Maybe not the crazy part. Whatever it takes, honey, I'm here to support you. Thanks, Dad. I, I do appreciate that. Ugh, parking in this neighborhood sucks. I'm glad you picked me up. I needed a break from studying. Yeah, it's time to have some fun for a change. So where are we going? Dev and Si have this really cool loft in the Pearl District. Katie, I hope you're not expecting me to hook up with Si. Uh, he liked you. So? I thought you were trying to set me up with Nathan. Uh, who said you couldn't talk to other guys? Or date two guys at once? Come on, this is what best friends are for. Dictating my dating life? Oh, no, wait, wait, ruining my dating life. His place is just a block up. Come on man, get off of me! What are you talking about, man? I didn't do anything. I didn't say anything. You guys gotta go. Now! I, I didn't do anything! What's going on? I didn't say anything! -I didn't say anything! -Go! I didn't say anything! -Go! -Who is it? I didn't do anything. Get off me! Okay, what was that all about? I don't think it was a big deal. It's probably just guys being idiots. It looked like a little more than that, Katie. Look, it's better that we just don't say anything. You know? They could lose their scholarships if they get in trouble. I never should have come out with you. Don't say that! Okay. Yes, but as long as you know what I'm trying to do. This is a big client, and we are going to deliver the interface they want. Uh, I gotta go. I will update you later. Hi. Ugh, another tight deadline and a lot weighing on it. How was last night? You went straight to bed. Uh, yeah, I was tired. You want some breakfast? Uh, I don't have time, Katie is picking me up. How is she? Oh, well you know Katie. Always seems to find the drama. Yeah, she is a bit of a drama queen. She got into college. Wow. Yeah, early admission. Okay, well, good for her. So will you. Yeah, I gotta go. Okay, have a great day. Bye. Have you heard from Dev or Si at all? No, I'm sure they're both fine. I know what will cheer you up though. What? I got you into college. No more SAT stuff to worry about. What? What are you talking about? But you're thrilled. I guess, but I don't really believe you. Well, it's true. How do you think Dev and Si got into college, and me? You applied, aced the SAT? I don't know. Not a chance. We paid some guy to take the SAT for us. Well, my mom paid. You cheated? My God, don't put it that way. Uh, you said yourself how competitive it is. And unless you're a straight A student who spends all your time studying, you're screwed. And who has time for that? No, Katie, this isn't funny. Cheating isn't for me. You, you said you got early admission. Well, not really. I call it easy admission. No, no, whatever you did, undo it please. Come on! Imagine how much fun it'll be when we're roommates throwing amazing parties. No! Okay, that's not a very nice thank you. It's too late anyway, I already paid the down payment. My mom will kill me, and then you. Okay... Anni, you work so hard, and deserve to get in more than anyone. So, this is just using the system the way that everybody else does. What? Would you rather be a barista that goes to community college? Friends don't help friends cheat, Katie. That's not the way this works. Are you still pissed at me? Yeah, I am. It was a huge favor. That I didn't ask for. Okay, fine. If you're going to be like that, I'm going to text Nathan, tell him you can't come to the party on Friday 'cause you're preggers. Katie, what you did is wrong! For me, for you, for anyone. I don't want to be the kind of person who cheats their way into college. It's not cheating. It's just buying a get into college card. That's cheating. I did it because I love you, and I just want to hang out at college like we always planned. So it was totally selfish, but I know it's what you want. I just made it a whole lot easier. You're unreal. I know. No, I mean you just carry on as if whatever. It's a special skill I have. Surprise. You got time to chat? Hi, uh, sure. I could use a break. So I had a really great time chatting with Anni. You know, since the separation I've been worried about how it all will affect her. I really want to be a great dad, you know. You are a great dad and I appreciate you making an effort to be a part of her life. She does seem a bit stressed out. Yeah, I think it's the weight of taking the SAT and her senior year. You remember what it was like. I'm going to do everything I can to help her. I just need her to be a little more disciplined, and learn how to stay focused when things get tough. She is a teenager. Well, that's what I'm afraid of. Could you just back me up and encourage her to get her SAT scores up? I don't want to be the only bad cop. You got it. Hey, you want to go grab a coffee? I have to get back to it. It's really nice seeing you. You too. We'll talk later. Hey, I was texting you. Yeah sorry, I've just been busy with some stuff. No problem. Are we still on for the party? Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking I wouldn't have time, but uh, it'll be good for me. As long as you're still going? Totally. Long as you're still going. Totally. You know how I told you Katie got early admission? Mmm-hmm. It's impressive. Be nice to have it all done. For sure, but you will too. I mean, if Katie can do it, so can you. She's not the most organized, right? Except when it comes to parties. Interesting segue. Ah, uh-uh, I already asked you, and you said I could go. True. Mom, have you ever heard of, I don't know, people like taking advantage to get into college? Like going around the system? For sure. I mean those rumors have always been around. Why? Anni, you know that anything other than the normal, albeit tougher route to college is wrong, right? No, of course, and I agree, totally. Uh, I gotta go get ready anyway. I promised Katie. Anni, um, make good choices, you know. Just be sensible. Of course. Yeah! I'm good, thanks but- No, you're not. You've only had one. -Okay. -Where's Nathan? Uh, he's on his way. Come on, Anni, you're playing with the big kids now. We got zero stress about college, so live it up. Whoo! -Whoo! -Yay! You don't look like you're having any fun. Anni, right? Uh, yeah. What are you doing here? Oh, some of the students I coached last year invited me. We got to be pretty close. You seem very out of your comfort zone. Is it that obvious? Who do you know here? My guess is her. Yeah, that's my friend from school. I know. She ever mention me? No, should she? It seems like she'll fit in well at Pine State. You will too, you'll see. All the film students have your sense of humor. Hey man, can I help you with something? I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you decided to take a break from studying. So, does being at a party like this make you want to go to college even more? It depends on a lot of things. Come on lovebirds, you can do better than that. Anni owes me a big favor. What did she do? Nothing. She owes me big time. Just kidding. Whoo! Whoo! Unreal. I, uh, I'm glad I'm sharing an Uber home with you. What the heck do you think you're doing, Katie? Jumping in the pool in your clothes. -This isn't some high school- -What? ...party, you can't be doing this anymore. See, this is the way it works... You need to start listening, 'cause your friends are coming -and if you told them anything- -Babe! Are you okay? Si is missing. What? Was it something from the other night? What else have you told her? Nothing! We saw Si that night, you were there. And who have you told? I don't know what you're talking about. -Bull. -Back off. Get out of my face! Somehow they knew Si was bragging about his scholarship. It's not like he was exactly keeping it a secret. But it seems like ever since you've entered the picture, we've had problems. I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't want any trouble. It's a little late for that. Get her hand off her! This is none of your business, okay! We're going. No! Stay! You okay? I think some of Katie's friends might have cheated on the SATs. You're kidding. Did Katie? Nathan, you can't say anything. I'm, I'm not entirely sure how they did it. Don't get caught up in all that, Anni. This is dangerous. I'll, I'll speak to Ms. Kent tomorrow, she might be able to help us with this. I don't want any part of it. I just, I want to get out of here. Yeah, I'll call an Uber. Okay, I'll meet you outside then. I just, I gotta grab my bag. Don't go. Come on! No, Katie, I gotta go, Nathan's waiting for me outside. Come on, just one more shot with me. I gotta go. Nathan? Nathan! Nathan? Have you seen Nathan? No. This is so not like him. Come on, we're going home. You're wasted, you can stay at my house. I know. Let's go. Uh, good morning. Hey, Mom. Hi, Jennifer. What are you guys doing? Uh, what does it look like? Isn't the SAT this morning? Uh, yeah, we were just about to head out. Doesn't it start at nine? Whoops. Anni, what's going on? There'll be more tests. What, when did you decide this? You can't just change your mind. Mom, can you just let this go? I'll figure it out. You and I just had a really good talk. I thought we were on the same page. You were even going to a study group. Please, stop bugging me about this. It'll be fine. Anni... I'm an adult, I can make these decisions for myself. Did something happen last night? This is very unlike Anni. Just a mellow party. I haven't heard from Nathan, and he's not in school today. He's probably skipping class and working or something. Yeah maybe, I guess. I just, I have been texting him and he hasn't responded. Hmm, maybe he's playing a bit hard to get. Wants to make sure you're serious. Have you talked to Dev? No, why? He seems to think I've done something. I can't believe I let you get me into this mess. Hold on, I'm helping you. As in I'm doing you a favor. That I didn't ask for! Don't panic. That Si guy is missing, Katie. This is all so screwed up. Anni, you are totally freaking out for no reason. Dev hasn't said anything. Why can't we just go to the police? Tell them what we saw. Do you realize how stupid that sounds? How are you going to explain all this to the cops? What I'm doing for you, what we're doing for here isn't something you want to go around sharing. I know it's kind of screwed up that people are getting into college and faking their SAT scores, but it works. And it's working for us. You and me together at college, right? How much did you pay? Me? Nothing. But my mom will pay 250 once you're in. For now, just a down payment of 50. Thousand? It's kind of a deal. And for that, you'll ace your SAT and the essays and get a full scholarship. It's guaranteed. And like that, your stresses and worries are gone. Who takes the SAT for me? You'll meet him. All you need to do is go see a doctor and get a dispensation. I don't really have a choice right now, do I? You've already paid for it. Your mom will kill me if I don't do it. Just be careful what you say to your mom. She's asking way too many questions. What? I still don't think this is a good idea. The money is spent, it's happening. You're going to meet the guy. It'll be all good, okay? Are you coming with me? No, not for this. It's part of the process. -You'll be fine. -Follow me. Get in the back. Uh, I'm, I'm Anni. You don't want to know my name, understand? And don't say anything, just listen. The less we all know, the better. Don't freak out about this, you look like a wreck. This is not a big deal. I do this all the time, okay? So, this is how this goes down. You get your doctor to write you a note saying you can't take the SAT in a big room full of stupid little students, 'cause it freaks you out. Then I'm going to take the SAT for you. Make sense? Just nod. We submit your SAT as if you took it, it's that simple, understood? We don't talk again. We don't exchange texts. We don't wave on the street. -You just have to get- -My doctor to sign on. I understand. Good. Have a nice life. Now get out. This is a nice surprise. Anni, what's up? Nothing. Honey, I'm a lawyer, I got a sixth sense for trouble. You okay? Yeah, no, I'm, I'm good. It's just, I've got a friend... and they're, they're in a bit of a bind. What kind of a bind? I don't think I can say, but she, they, they might be in over their heads. Is it you? No. No, I'm good. Like I said I just don't know what they should do. Well, that's uh, kind of cryptic. But if someone's broken the law, they might want to talk to a lawyer and go to the police. Does that help? Yeah, I guess. Anni, you know you can always talk to me, right? I'm here for you. Thanks, Dad. All good? Yeah, stop worrying. You can go. I won't be late. Wait, Mom. Quick question. Yeah? -Don't be judgy. -I'm not judgy. You're totally judgy, sometimes in a good way. There's a good way to be judgy? My, my plan is to go to college, but I have to get in first, right? It's ultra competitive, and I don't stand a chance if I bomb my SAT. Katie told me about a way that makes you more competitive. Gives people like me a shot. Anni, we talked about this the other night, it's out of the question. And even if I wanted to, it takes money, a lot of money. But that's beside the point, it's against the law. Imagine what your father would think if we even suggested something like this. It just sounds like a lot people are doing it. Yeah, but you're not. If Katie and her mom are involved in this, that's their business. Is it clear? -Yeah. -Okay. Have a good night. I'll see you later. You what? Why? I just, I wanted to see how she'd react. I didn't tell her what you did for me. Okay, how did you think she'd react? I told you not to say anything to anyone. This was our secret. I just, I still don't think this is a good idea. What else did you tell her? Nothing, nothing, I swear. Did you hear from Nathan? No, and I'm really, I'm starting to get worried. I've texted him, I've called, I've gone by his house and I haven't heard anything. What'd Nathan's parents say when you went by? No one was home both times I went. Katie, this isn't right. I'm sure you'll hear from him. You worry too much. You don't really worry enough. Katie! Katie, don't kid around! Katie! Sorry, I got a surprise here. I gotta run. See ya. Okay. You scared the hell out of me. Si's dead. The cops found his body. Wait, did it happen the other night? I guess. I don't know. This is bad, Katie, bad. Where's your friend Anni? At home, why? What else does your little friend know? Don't call her that, okay? She's my best friend and she's had nothing to do with any of this. You were stupid for saying anything to her. Screw you, okay. I'm doing what we've all done, just helping a friend. She's a liability! Just like Si, okay? Listen. Get her out of the scheme and tell her to keep her mouth shut. All she knows is that I paid some money. She met the guy taking her SAT today. -It's cool. -It's not. She's telling people about it like her stupid boyfriend. They're not like us, Katie. Wait, did you do something to Nathan? No. Why, what happened to him? Oh, God. Okay, look, this is getting so out of control. This is bad, Dev. Like really bad. They think Anni did blab, and they definitely thought Si did and who knows about this Nathan guy. See how they work now? We're next. We are so screwed. Let me in. Oh. What the hell? I was just checking up on you. You could have called. Um, I need to tell you something. And it's lousy news, Anni. That guy you met, Si... He's dead. The police found his body. What? Yeah, it's brutal. But it's got nothing to do with us, understand? Does it have anything to do with Nathan? I doubt it. Just don't freak out and think it does. What have I let you get me into? That's my mom. You better keep your mouth shut. Mom! Are you okay? He, uh, he grabbed me from behind and I was face down before I knew it. Did he say anything? Yeah. "You better keep your mouth shut." Does that mean anything to you? No. Did you see his face? No. How about you, Katie? I didn't really see anything. Okay. We'll have a car in the neighborhood, okay? -A few times tonight. -Yeah. If you need anything, please call. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll see myself out. Mom, I'm scared. Oh, it's okay. They're going to look out for us now. What did he want? I don't know. We should let dad know. Dev, what's going on? Were you just here? Good morning. How did you sleep? Okay, once I fell asleep. Yeah, me too. But I saw the police drive by. We're going to be okay. Do you want me to give you a lift to school? Sure, that sounds nice. I, uh, I've got a study group thing after school today anyway. What class? Just SAT again. I can get Katie to drive me home. Did you register for the next one? Sorry, I don't mean to be a bug. It's okay. I did. I told you I'd handle it. You need to trust me on this. I do, I do trust you. Have you heard anything? No. Just trust me, that's all that matters. You got me into this and that Si guy turned up dead and now Nathan is missing. Look, it's probably unrelated. I'm sorry it's freaking you out, I really am. I just want to know what happened to Nathan, and yeah, Katie, I'm really starting to freak out. -I just... -What? I'm done. We got to call somebody and tell them to not involve me, cancel the whole thing. But we can't. We just need to be quiet and not do anything rash. You lied to me. You told me that this was going to be easy and that everyone was doing it. Listen, I wanted to help you, and half the things I'm finding out now, I never knew about either. And I'm sorry, I really am. You just need to be careful and everything will work out. Careful about what? Uh, nothing, this study group isn't what we thought it would be. What's Katie involved in? Can you stop listening to my private conversations? I got you something today. Don't get too excited. I logged in to your College Board account and I noticed that you hadn't registered for the next SAT yet, so I did it for you. And uh, isn't the card cute? It was supposed to be a bit funny. It isn't. You have to stop butting in. I told you I would do this. Well, then why didn't you register for it, Anni? Stop pestering me. Anni please, this is important. Mom, you need to back off and let me live my own life. I'm sorry. Thank you. I know you're under a lot of pressure, but please don't snap at me like that. You want to talk about what's bugging you? I don't think I can, but I'm fine. I mean, I'm not doing anything. But someone is? You mentioned to me that Katie's involved in something to do with college admissions. Has she talked to her mom about it? I don't know. You're a good kid. You don't need to do anything illegal to get into college. You'll get in on your own smarts. Good morning. Hi, Detective Gordon. Is Anni home? Uh, she is. Come in. I'm wondering if you know Nathan Aldridge? Uh, yeah. Yeah, he goes to my school. What's going on? He was reported missing and we know from phone records you were trying to contact him. Did something happen to him? We don't know. I understand he was at a party the last night he was seen. Yeah, I went with my friend Katie. So you saw Nathan that night? Uh, we met up there, yeah. Was Nathan involved in a fight? We have a witness at the party who says he was arguing with a Dev Anderson. Know anything about that? Do you know Dev Anderson? No, I don't. Was Nathan involved in any drugs that you know of? No, no, he, he's a really good guy. Do you think something happened to him? Well, we don't know if it was foul play, but it's unlikely that he would run away. He had a lot going for him. He does. I appreciate your time. If he contacts you, let me know. Thank you, Detective. Thank you. I'm so sorry, sweetie. I'm sure they'll find him. It was very silly. No, and I heard about it too. Well, don't you look fabulous? Let me call you back. What are the odds of us meeting like this? What are the odds? I think there are some things we should talk about. Okay. We have an arrangement and I fully expect you to uphold your part of the deal. What arrangement? Anni Kerr, we haven't received the rest of the payment yet. I look forward to collecting my money. What have you been up to? What? Nothing, I'm just hanging out. Katie, what have you done? Okay, where is this coming from? I just ran into somebody today who seems to think I owe him a lot of money. So I checked my card, there's a $50,000 charge on it. Just do a balance transfer or whatever. It's not like you can't afford it. Don't tell me what I can and can't afford! It was for Anni. We'd always planned on going to college together and it didn't look great for her, so I thought we could help. -Katie! -I know. I'm sorry, Mom. I just thought it was such a great idea. If we don't help, she won't get in and then she and me won't be able to go to college together. Anni is not my responsibility! Yeah, but you paid for me to get in. You're my daughter. What I did for you was a one time deal. You had no right to involve Anni in this. You have no idea what you've done. Morning. How's it going? Hey, uh, good. You haven't seen Katie anywhere, have you? No, no, I haven't. Hey, I got your new SAT scores in, congrats. I knew you could do it. Are you getting excited about next year? Yeah, I guess. Oh, you'll have a great time at college. And you thank me in your Oscar acceptance speech. Katie, can you, can you please call me, text me, whatever? It doesn't matter. You seem jumpy. What do you want? From you? So much. But let's start with the easy stuff. Did your friend say anything to the cops? Of course not. She wouldn't, I trust her. So you trust her to come up with the money? What do you mean? Don't play stupid with me. You know damn well how this works. Someone's got to pay up for her, your mommy's card isn't working. Seems she had no idea what you're up to. I, I don't have the money. Well, that's too bad, 'cause we want the money now. I'll, I'll figure something out. Not good enough. And for what she's getting, and the risk I'm now taking by helping someone we haven't vetted, the price has gone up. No, you can't do that. I don't think you have a choice. It's now 300,000 payable to our little charity. What? I wonder how this is going to go over with Mommy. Screw you. Insult me all you want, it doesn't make this go away. I just need some more time. Time has run out. But maybe you and I can come to another agreement. Katie? Katie! Katie! Katie! Oh, my God, Katie. Help! Somebody help me! Katie. Hey, Anni. Thank you so much for being there for her. I'm just so happy that you found her. She could have been there all night. How's she doing? I don't know, there's just so many tests. You can talk to her. She'll hear you. She knows how much you love her, I think it would help. Hey, Katie. You're going to be okay. It's going to be okay. She is going to be okay, right? How is she? Oh, uh, she's, I don't know. Her mom says that the doctors are taking it day by day. It's just so awful what happened. Sweetie, if you want to stay home, I'm sure your teachers will be fine with it. No, I want to go to school. I should be there. Yeah, well, it's good to keep busy. Would you like to borrow my car or do you want me to drive you? No, I, I want to walk. -Yeah. -You sure? Yeah, I'm going to go see Katie after school anyway. I'm sorry to hear about Katie. I didn't know what to do. It's okay. You were there. Were you involved in what Katie did? When I heard that Katie did well on the SAT and got into Pine State, I... I put two and two together. I didn't want to get involved. Be careful, Anni. I need you to wake up, Katie. I need you to be here with me. You keep saying that we're best friends and we are best friends forever. Your hair is a mess. You would be so upset. Has there been any progress? No. What are you doing here? I just wanted to check in. I heard what happened, such a shock. -I should go. -No. Stay. You're Anni, right? I've heard a lot about you. Well, you know a lot about her, too. She's the one your sweet daughter's paying us to help. You owe us $300,000. I didn't know about any of this. You can't make me pay for something I didn't agree to. I've paid people to do a job and now I need to be paid. How dare you. How dare you do this to us. I want my money. You have 24 hours. I do hope your daughter recovers. Oh, God. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. No, she, she did it for me. I'll, I'll pay him. No! No, you can't. This is wrong. But we don't have any other options. Some charity? This is a front. Excuse me, Ms. Kent? Hi, I'm Anni Kerr's mom. Oh, I love Anni. It's nice to meet you. I'm worried Anni's in trouble. May have gotten involved in something she shouldn't have. Do you know what I'm talking about? Anni's alluded to some sort of a college scam, some deal to get into college. I, I think her friend might be involved too. It should never have spread to Anni. Look I, I wish I could've stopped them both. So you do know. Okay, this has gone too far. There's a man named Reilly, I've looked into him, but I can't find anymore information. Do you know who he is or who he works for? Please, this is my daughter! You would do the same thing if it was yours. You need to be very careful, okay? If Anni's involved with them they could be watching right now. I've heard that other students, kids of rich famous parents are involved, okay? I would just do nothing right now. Hope it all blows over. No one can stop me from doing everything I can for my daughter. Marshall Callidus. I've heard rumors that he runs some charity. It's called the Educating Youth Foundation. It's a total scam, but could be at the heart of everything. Just please don't mention my name, okay? If he finds out I told you, I'm as good as dead. Get away from me! What are you doing nosing around? I'm calling the police. I would be very careful if I were you. Be sad if your daughter met the same fate as her friend. He threatened me. He told me to be careful. His voice sounded the same as the man who attacked me the other night. Why would someone be attacking you? I think Anni's involved in some sort of scheme to get into college or her friend Katie forced her into it. What do you mean? Anni's been secretive lately, Grant. But she basically told me her friend Katie did it, cheated the system, and faked her SAT scores. Probably by bribing someone. I've heard of celebrity families doing this sort of thing. It's unreal that they think it could be okay. This could mean real prison time for everyone involved, right? Yeah, I guess. I mean at a minimum they'd be looking at racketeering, money laundering, conspiracy to defraud. The high school counselor seemed genuinely terrified. She mentioned a man named Marshall Callidus. He runs a charity called Educating Youth, which I'm guessing is a front for whatever this con is. Does his name or the charity's name ring any bells? I'm going to look into this. What do you know about this, Grant? Just let me take care of this. I want you to tell me everything that's going on. Ah, always good to see our attorney. Have you been lying to me all along? Calm down. Did you involve my daughter in your illegal scheme? You can't be that naive, she came in willingly. With the assistance of her best friend. Such lovely young girls. I am no longer your attorney. Come on now, we're your biggest client. Got a lot of work coming up for you. I'm done with you. You stay away from my daughter. Don't you dare go near her and don't you dare involve her in this, this mess. I'm afraid it's not that simple. We have a deal. I suggest you do what you're told to keep your daughter safe and sound. I'm sorry. I just can't believe this. Mom, you have to believe me. I didn't want to get involved. Katie set the whole thing up. She told me she would pay the money and that everything would be easy. But she never paid it? No. I guess she thought her mom's card would be charged and, and no one would notice, I don't know. But ever since then, it's just been horrible. Do you think this might have something to do with what happened to Nathan? I don't know. I was with Nathan that night, I was, but he left just ahead of me and I haven't heard from him since. And you never saw him get into a fight? No. Anni, now is the time to be really honest with me. Remember that guy Reilly I told you about? Yes, the consultant. I think he might have been involved with the death of Katie's friend, Si. Anni. Katie and I were out the other night, we, we saw something, and I don't know what, but, but the next thing I know this, this guy just turns up dead. Why didn't you come to me? We could have gone to the police. I couldn't. I couldn't. Either I go to jail for getting involved with this scam, or they kill me for talking about it. Mom, I, what was I supposed to do? I'm sorry, really sorry. I can fix this. This has gone far enough. I really want to rip your head off right now. I know Katie's been hurt and I'm sorry for that, but you need to go to the police about this college scam. Don't play dumb, it's time to come clean. How did you hear about it? Friends in the film business. There's doctors, lawyers, this is huge. There's a lot of people and millions of dollars at play here. You knowingly broke the law. I know, I know, I know. And I'll fix it. I only want what's best for both Katie and Anni. If you really want what's best for them, you'll stop trying to fix things yourself and you'll let the police do their job. Jennifer, that might put Anni in more danger. Stop trying to protect yourself. You know that the police will eventually figure this out and you'll be going to prison. You want to know what this is all about? Come with me. You need to meet someone. Yeah. This is over. I want my money back, all of it. The $50,000 my daughter paid for her friend too. I'll call you back. This isn't Saks Fifth Avenue, you can't just return something you're not satisfied with. No need for the introductions, I know who you are, Ms. Kerr. Someone's going to have to pony up the money for the extra help. No, no one's paying you a thing. And we could easily go to the police, or a reporter, and then your face and name would be all over the news and you'd be finished. So this is what's happening: we're done, we're out. Do you understand? I don't think you want to see what I'm really capable of. And don't you dare point your finger at me again. Hey, don't threaten us. You've taken advantage of people with money. You've bribed, lied, cheated everyone every step of the way. All of my clients agreed with what we offered. There were no surprises. Do you really think either of you would get out of this without facing jail time? You're just as guilty. I go down, you go down. And you, just another washed up actress. Probably make you feel good to see your name in the headlines again for all the wrong reasons. -I don't care. -Let's go. We need to shut this down, it's gone too far. Killing the boy wasn't smart. Shut it down, now. I want our money out and safe. The lawyer will help, but we need to guarantee he doesn't talk. Keep him focused. Something he will stop at nothing to protect, understand? Katie, I want you to know how much I love you. And that we're still, we're still going to do everything we planned. That's kind of sappy. You're awake! I just fake it so I can hear people say nice things about me. That's not funny. How are you feeling? Major headache. I'm so glad you're awake. I'm sorry I got you involved in this mess. Katie, look at you. I know. It was really stupid what I did. I know why you did it. You just wanted to make our dream come true. We can still get out of this. No, Anni, I don't think that we can. We're part of what they're doing. And Dev said we can't back out. He warned me about it. And I don't think they'll like it if we back out. They're going to do anything they can to protect themselves. That Reilly guy, he seemed- No! He isn't who he seems. And he's not going to want to go to prison for what he's been doing. Be careful, Anni. Really careful. Call Mom. Mom, come on, pick up. Anni? Mom, there's a car following me. Anni, what's happening? It's the same black car I saw before. Where are you? Anni, where are you? Anni? Mom... I can't see who it is, I just turned on to Oliver. What do I do? Is there anyone around you can ask for help? No. Anni. Anni! Who are you? Leave her alone! Are you okay? Hi. You okay? An-, Anni? Anni? Grant, Anni disappeared. What? Did she say where she might be going? No. I'll keep trying her. Nathan? Nathan. Nathan. Oh Anni, pick up. Please, please, please no! Hello? Anni... Get out of my house. No, no, please, please, I'm Dev! I'm a friend of Anni and Katie's. What are you doing here? I need to find Anni. She might be in trouble. The people that we were dealing with, I've let things go on for too long and I'm terrified that they're going to try and kill me, us. Look, we can all be in big trouble here. Why do they want to hurt Anni? They think that she's been telling people about what they're doing and, and they're blaming her for ruining it all, but it wasn't her. And now my buddy Si is dead. And her friend Nathan is missing. Yeah, people think that I had something to do with Nathan but, but I would never. Look, what we did to get into college was wrong, but I don't want to die. Anni's not answering her phone, I can't find her. Her text messages would show up on her laptop, right? Just, just let me go. Shut up. I never meant to get involved. I, I'll keep it quiet, I promise. I just, I want to go home. Too late for that now. She was texting with Nathan. So he's alive! Where is he? I don't know. Why would she go to a warehouse on Burdett? I know the place. One of the guys from the scam works out of there. -Did you drive? -What? Your keys, I need them. Uh, yeah, yeah. I want you to call the police, ask for a Detective Gordon, you tell her where I'm going. I didn't say anything. Please, you know I didn't. This is out of my hands. There's so much I could have done for you. College of your dreams guaranteed. But, maybe Daddy can save you. Where's Anni? I was expecting you about now. I asked you where is she? And to think that I had no idea who she was at first. Talk about convenient. What have you done with my daughter? Let me make this really simple for you. We've kept your daughter alive because we need your help, simple as that. If you want your daughter to remain safe, you will cooperate. Leave her out of this. Afraid it doesn't work like that. You see you are stuck between a rock and, well, me. I'm going to the cops. You may want to see this first. Anni! Where is she? Seems like you and I have a bit of a common interest now, don't we? You let her go! Kind of funny, isn't it? They wanted me to get your daughter in on the deal, now I'm using your daughter to keep you working for us. Let me be clear, we will kill your daughter if you do not do what we need you to do. As our lawyer, you will make sure none of this is traceable back to me. You will make sure the funds, all of them, appear in the accounts. When that is done, and only then, will I release your daughter. So no heroics, Dad. Interesting, says a lot about a father who would leave his daughter tied up somewhere. If you harm her, I will kill you. Help, help, help me! If only it were that easy. There's someone you should meet. Nathan! Nathan. We needed him and his phone. That way you'd do what you're told. I'm sorry. Problem is now you both know too much. So nice you could be together. Nathan... Mom! -Are you okay? -Yeah. I'm going to get you out of here. I'm here now. -Let's go. -Nathan! Come on, let's go. -Come on, come on. -What's going on? Anni, run. Run! Nathan, come on. Don't you move. I told you to be careful. Let me go. Anni, get out. -Mom. -Go, go! Do not move. What are you going to do, shoot me? Anni! Go! Nathan, Nathan, come on. Come on, we got to go. Go guys, come on, come on, go, go! He's inside. There's a gun in the hallway. I'm okay, Mom. Nervous? Yeah. You did it though. I did, and all by myself. Your senior year was not easy. No kidding. Well, your father and I are very proud to have such a fearless daughter. I'll call him later, let him know how today went. I heard the DA's going easy on him for cooperating. He turned over his files and convinced the DA you had no idea what Katie was up to. I saw Katie. She loves her college. She's doing great. Says it's tough though. Her mom will still likely go to jail even though she plead guilty. Well, they did the right thing. I'm proud of you, Mom. You had the courage to stand up to them and now college is fairer for everyone, where people actually earn their spot, like me. -Hi, Jennifer. -Hi. -Hi. -Hi. Okay, well, I can see I'm not needed here anymore. You, keep an eye on her. Are you kidding? I'm keeping an eye on him. True. Have a great first day. Thanks, Momma. Go.
