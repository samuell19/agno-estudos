Ah, what's up! Dude, this is a beauty. What a beauty! My man, if I had a ride like this, it would be full of babes. Ah! In your dreams, bra! Girls go where they can smell the money. And this car… Oh! Hey, Shain! Hey! Good afternoon, Mai Busi. Hello, Shaina. How are you? Shaina. What are you doing, huh? It's a drip irrigation, Granny. Please help me. I need them to stand. So, just push the pipes into the soil and tie it with that string. Okay. Oh, alright. Thank you, Granny. Now look at this. Normally, the water evaporates. This way, we don't waste. The pipes take the water straight to where it's needed. You said it's a what? Drip irrigation. This is good. Come. Very good. I’ll be done in a minute. Okay. Ah! Zororo. - How's your day been? - It's been good, my grandchild. Okay, okay, okay. I see. Makes sense. Your sister's not here. I know. I came to give you this. Here, check it out. I thought of you the minute I saw it. You could win a university scholarship. - Are you making fun of me? - No. I’m not an engineer. You could be. Think about it. If you win, they will pay for your studies. And how would I do that? Build something. I mean, you are always building things. Like… Like this. People like me don't win competitions like that. I don’t even have my A levels yet. Okay, suit yourself. And then, what's that now? You know how you always say it's too dark in here for the mirror? Well, now, you can angle it in any which way the light is coming. - Are you going out? - Just over to Busi's. - Have you done your homework? - Granny, it's the weekend. You have exams coming up, Shaina. You must study. I will. You are the first person in this family to reach A levels. It's a blessing you must not take for granted. But Mama went to school. But she did not finish. The future belongs to those who build on what's come before. Like the story of the donkey. You know that one, right? I think so. The donkey who falls into a hole and the farmer can't get him out. Remind me again, Granny. He decides the merciful thing to do is bury the poor thing, to shorten the donkey’s suffering. He starts shoveling soil into the hole. But the donkey just shakes it off and stands on it. The farmer shovels some more. The donkey shakes it off, stands on it. You get the idea? Up and up… Until the donkey walks right out of the hole. Exactly. I like that, Granny. But I’m finished, so throw dirt, on me another time, okay? Granny? - What are you doing? - What? You talk about the future, then you throw salt in like it's going out of fashion. It brings out the flavors. No! Your blood pressure! Remember what the doctor said? You also have to think of the future, right? You don't want to give me a child. Hey. Ah, Kudakwashe, is that what you think? So, how do you want me to perceive it? - You're wasting. - Is this what you're saying? That I don't want to give you a child? How long are you going to keep doing this, Stella? As long as I have to. But you don't have to. I made a promise when Mama was dying. Don't make this about them. They're gone. Mimi is 11, Stella. You think she doesn't see the things you're doing? I’m making good on my promise, Zororo. Even if it means you're gonna get sick? Or worse, get yourself killed. Is that what they would have wanted? What choice do I have? Let me help you. You just finish your A levels. If you do well, then you can earn the big bucks. And maybe I can find another way, okay? Zo… Faro! Faro! Where is my daughter? She was here just now. Is this yours? Huh? The Bashful Bride. I think that belongs to Faro. Wonderful books, ma'am. Impeccable taste. And who are you? Condoms, Mommy. All types, all sizes. This is a family-friendly establishment and you expect me, a pious woman of God, to perpetuate fornication by peddling your sinful ware. Everyone knows you’ve got to cover the worm before you squirm. Just take your things and go. I don't want my customers looking at your filth. Oh, okay. Mommy, um… What about female condoms? If I could dance like you, I would go places. There are other ways, girl. Now you sound like my brother. He keeps asking about you. It's "Shain this", it's "Shain that". "What is she like?" - Blah blah blah… - Nonsense, Stella. I’m telling you. He really likes you. Anyway, don't change the subject. What would you do if you could do anything? I’m thinking of, you know, cross-border buying and selling kids' stuff. If I could bring that stuff in, maybe it would sell. Get out of here! - Out! - Mommy! There is a bar down the road. Go there! You will find plenty of drunkards and non-believers. That woman is hardcore, hey. Let me go buy something from him. Maybe I can get a discount. At least you're being safe. Sure, most of the time. "Most of"? What does that mean? Thank you, thank you. Oh bond, bond, bond… Shain. Where's my mother? She's right there. She's asking for you. And then? Faro, what's wrong? Faro? Are you okay? - Did you go out drinking last night? - Nope. - Are you sick? - I wish I was. Come on, Faro. It's not like you're pregnant. Faro, are... - Are you… Are you pregnant? - I think so, like… I’m late as well. - How late? - Very late. Please, Shain, don't tell anyone. - Not even the girls? - Especially not the girls. I need to figure everything out. This is such a mess. Does TK know? You're literally the only person I’ve told about this. Shain, everything, everything I’ve worked for… Okay, let's forget fashion school for a minute. Let’s put that aside. What are people going to say? What am I gonna do? How am I going to raise an entire baby? We’ll make a plan. Plan, Shain? Do you know my mother? Do you know that woman? I feel like such a fool, honestly. I’m so sorry, Faro. Keep it down. Daddy is sleeping. It's okay. I’m awake. How are you feeling? Like I’ve been lying down for far too long. Mama is at a church meeting. The kids are… Well, you heard them. And I’m going over to Shain's. You don't have to open up anymore. I’m not contagious, you know? TB or no TB, fresh air is good. Did you take your pills? - Not yet. - Daddy! You can't stop now. Look, you’re past halfway. Just a few more weeks and you're done. It's just so difficult to remember, my child, when you start feeling better. But you know what? I’m actually going to take a walk today. Go out there and regain my strength. That's good. That's really good. And in no time, I’ll be back at work. I’m just glad you're getting better. Thanks to you, my child. If you'd not dragged me to the clinic, they might not have caught it in time. But they did. Thank God. Hey, guys. Hi, Granny. - Hey, Busi. - Hi, Busi. Sorry, I’m late. - Hi, Busi. - A vetkoek for you? Maybe one. Thanks, Granny. Got to watch my figure. - What figure? - Please, can you eat this? Not all of us have a TK, Faro. You're so lucky, my friend. He's the one. I’m telling you. Once you finish school, wedding bells, babies. I can see it in your future. She's way too young for that. Wait a few years and do your fashion things first. A woman's got to be able to stand on her own two feet, just in case. Am I right, Granny? By the time I was your age, I was taking care of a husband, a baby. Ten years later, I had another three, including her father. And then I was a widow. - What happened to Grandpa, Granny? - He left for war and got malaria. He ignored it and suffered the symptoms in silence. By the time the doctor got to him, it was too late. There I was, no husband, three little kids, and I hadn't even finished school. Why did you stop? In those days, parents thought a girl was better off in the kitchen than in the classroom. And nowadays, it seems you all want to be in the dance hall - rather than in the classroom. - Granny. Granny, please, it's the weekend. Life is tough enough. We also need to relax. Come on, guys. Let's dance. Stella, do you have the music? Thank you. Okay. Do you guys get it? Five, six, five, six, seven, eight… Go, Granny! - Ah! Busi! Uh-huh, no! It’s not fair. - Every time, Busi. Granny? - I'm okay. - Granny? Granny, what's wrong? I’m alright. Okay, let's get you to sit down, Granny. Just dizzy, but I’m okay. I’m fine. You girls remind me of the ostrich who wanted to fly. Did I ever tell you that story? Class, we are left with five weeks until the end of term. - Then, next term it is…? - Exams. That is right. Exam time. Nice work, Zororo. You're coming along so well. Now, as you all know, you have to pay per subject. A fixed fee for each and every exam you are going to write. You could do better, Shain. You now need to focus. Yes, ma'am. What is that? This? It's a scale. You are weighing a dead bee. May I ask why? You have to focus. In the next five weeks, you have to go and pay your exam fee to the Bursar, who will hand it over to the exam authority on the last day of the term. - He should pass it to him. - Pass. - Yes, I told you! - I knew it. He’s got mad skills, doesn’t he? Hey. Zo? He's okay. Are you here to see TK? I’ve got to do it sooner or later. It’s going to be fine, right? It's going to be okay? It's going to be fine. Don't worry, you got this. I mean, you have to tell him. - Yeah. - It's okay. - Let me go. - Okay. - Dude, your man, hey! - What man? - Let's go! - Aweh, G, aweh. Hey. What's up? TK, I’m pregnant. What? Ssh… Keep your voice down. How long have you known? A couple of days. - Is it mine? - What? Of course it is. How can you be so sure? I wish we never had sex in the first place. What happened? Did I force you? What do you want me to do? Marry you? Pay for the abortion? What are you looking for, Faro? What am I looking for? I’m looking for a man who can take responsibility for his actions. Me take responsibility?! What about you? There's the pill, there’s that morning after thing. You know I wanted to continue to… You know I wanted to keep using the condoms, but you said we should stop. I trusted you. And I love you, and I thought… I thought you loved me too? - Yeah, well, maybe I did. - Did? Or do I? I don't know. This is too much! It’s a lot of money, Granny. I mean, at that price, they should at least guarantee you a distinction. When I think of all the vegetables that you will have to sell, and for what? I would be lucky to get a steady factory job or work in a shop. You don’t need A levels for that. But the money could get us a lot more chickens. It could fix the roof, get us some new curtains. Granny! One, there is time to plant and time to harvest. Amen. There is time to be born and time to die. - Amen. - Amen. There is time to seed and time to gather. So, today, we are here to mourn our Granny. Hallelujah. It’s a day that needs the Holy Spirit of the Lord to comfort our hearts. We know this is the day, one day one of us… For Granny. This couch goes to the brother. Hello, Shain. Look what they did, Miss. Do you have any relatives staying here with you? Turns out no one has the time. So, I’m alone now. It’s better that way. At least they haven't taken the house yet. Not yet, at least. Shain. When can we expect to see you back at school? Now that my Granny is gone, I’m going to have to look for work. I checked with the Bursar. Your fees are paid in full, all through to the end of the year. - They are? - And it would be a waste not to use them. Shain, you've come this far. You need to finish. Don't think I haven't seen how clever you are with your hands. You just need to apply yourself and you could have a bright future. What future, Miss? I have nothing. My parents are gone. And now my Granny is gone. I have nothing. Shain, wait! I didn't... Shain! Heavenly Father, we pray for the food that is before us. We thank you. Father God, in difficult times, it's important that we be there for each other. We give thanks. Amen. Amen. You should have seen the place, Mama. They cleaned it out. I thought relatives were supposed to offer support. Remember when Zororo and Stella's parents passed on? - Yes. - They came home and found it locked. They had sold it and everything in it. - Shain has got nothing, Ma. - Well, not nothing. I managed to save a little something that belongs to her. What is it? Daddy saw the way things were going with the relatives and… - They are mine. - Yes. Five eggs already. Thank you. I promised your granny that I'll look out for you if anything ever happens to her. But she asked me for one thing. That you finish your schooling. Faro! Get a move on! We're going to be late! What is wrong with you these days? Every day spending more and more time in the bathroom! Vanity is sin, my child. Read the Proverbs. "Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised." But you teenagers only worry about the way you look. Am I right? - Mama. - What is it? I… I’m not feeling well. - Sick? - Um… Nonsense. You just want to skip school and play on your phone all day. Texting boys and playing Tumbler and what not. - No, Mama, I... - No, I know you girls. Once the end is in sight, suddenly you think every day should be a holiday. From now on until exam time, it's going to be work, work, study, and more studying! Then, God willing, you'll get your foot in that fancy designer school. Shain. Welcome back. What made you change your mind? My Granny never had a chance to get educated. And my mother had to drop out. So, I figured I owe it to her. I’m so glad to see you back. Ms. Muzondo, when you said that my fees are covered, did that include the exam fees? I’m sorry, Shain, that still needs to be paid. Is there… I don't know, some sort of bursary I could apply for? You know how things are these days. The school can barely afford to buy text books. Could you help? - Maybe a loan? - I’d love to, Shain. I’ve got three children. There's nothing to spare. It's okay. Thank you. I’m glad someone can get some use of it. Sorry, I just took the kid to the toilet. I hope you don't mind. Excuse me. - Yes? - Were you at my granny's funeral? Oh yes. Yes, I was. Now I remember you. I’m Simba Dhaya. What's your name again? - Shain. Shaina. - Beautiful name, like the song. - Thank you. - This is my last born, Izwi. Izwi, this is your cousin. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Um, Uncle. - Yes? Do you know how this whole process of buying and selling airtime works? Upfront purchase. Is there a way I can maybe get the airtime first and then pay afterwards? They are very strict about the upfront purchase, you know. You’ve got to buy it first and then sell for profit. You know you’ve got to spend money to make money, right? It's the first rule of business. Then I guess I’m not going to be in business then. Hey. What's wrong? Where are you going? You'll never make it as an entrepreneur, if you give up so easily. - What do you suggest? - Everyone has to find their own way. As for me, I have taxis at the rank, not too far from where you stay. And whatever I'm doing right now is just something on the side. Just to expand the business. That's what they call entrepreneurship. You’ve got to find ways to make a profit. Hey, here's what we can do. Um… Uh, just give me your number, then I’ll see how best we can help each other. This is what I do. I mentor young people like you in business. Just here and there, informal. And you also come in as family. That's what family is all about, right? I don't have a phone. Thanks, but I just have to go and look for a job. Hey. Can I sit here? Yes, of course. So, you're here on business? - Yes. - Where are you from? Gaborone. Oh. How much? I’m worth it. Room 119. I’m going to go upstairs. You follow shortly. Hi. I’m looking for work. I saw the sign outside the window. But I can only do half days. I’m still in school. Thank you. Sister, how are you? Stella! Stella, what's wrong? What's wrong, Stella? I’m so scared, Shain. It's just one or two guys. Everyone else is okay with condoms. When last did you get tested? Okay, what if we go to the clinic to get you tested and see if anything is wrong? Look, if you've got something, you have to get on treatment. And if you don't, then you have nothing to worry about, right? Right, Stella? Eggs over here! Old man… Here are some eggs. Let's buy some eggs! Fresh from the chickens belly. From the dusty roads of Dombodema. Thank you. Take this one. Fresh eggs for a fresh woman. Pepper? Salt? Thank you. Eggs? Ah, sir, you don't have money. Eggs over here! Eggs over here! Stella, what happened? - HIV negative. - That's great. Yeah, for now. But there's still a window period until they can be sure. So, what's causing the pain? A different STI. Chlamydia. Very common but easily cured if treated early enough. If it had gotten worse, it's possible I wouldn't have been able to have kids someday. Now, I will be on antibiotics for a few weeks, and as long as I finish the course then… Then you stop indulging people who want to have sex without protection. Every time you get an STI, it could be HIV. For the sake of Zo and Mimi, it's not worth it. No matter what they pay. Okay, I swear it. - Hey! - Hello. You only making breakfast now? So, you think I can eat a dozen eggs? So then? Why so many eggs? A new business opportunity. At the taxi rank, after school. Twelve eggs, 12 steps closer to taking my A levels. Shy Shaina! You want to be a taxi-rank egg seller? You know what? Do your thing. I mean, it beats the hell out of… other options. It'll probably never work. No, don't say that. I mean, look. I’ll make you a deal, all right? You cook the eggs and I’ll cook the rhymes. Okay. Eggs… Eggs… ♪ Eggs that make you strong Eggs that make you healthy ♪ ♪ Even if you’re short Eggs can make you taller ♪ ♪ And if I became too tall I hope eggs will make me shrink! ♪ ♪ And if you became too fat Eggs will make you thinner! ♪ This money's short. Don't take me for a fool, hear me? That's all I have. I’m selling eggs over here! - Bring my money. - I don’t have money. Now look what… You… Eggs over here! Eggs over here! I’m selling eggs! - I’m selling eggs! - Finally found your calling? Eggs. What’s up? - How are you doing? - Good. Do you want to buy some? You can get a family discount. I can do better than that. I’ll send my boys to "big up" your eggs on their way to the rank. - So, what's your brand? - My what? Your brand, your label. What do you call your eggs? Um… "Shaina's Eggs". How’s that? "Rise and Shaina Eggs" sounds... Sounds great! "Rise and Shaina Eggs". I’ll spread the word. - Thank you. - Thank me later. - Eggs over here! Selling eggs! - Can that car leave? Can it go, please? Do you see Granny? I’m trying. And then? What happened to dancing? We'll dance, but just now. Now, we study. - Let's dance first. - Shh! Not now, Stella. We’ve got things to do. Oh! And what? - I don't have nothing? - I didn’t mean it like that, - but it's just that we're… - What’s Zimbabwe’s next big fancy fashion designer doing studying science? - Stella. - Mind your own business, Stella. We are all doing things we don't want to do. You want me to feel sorry for you, Miss "Mega Bucks"? Tell you that you're beautiful and you'll become a big fashion designer? - You think you are all that? - You don't know what you're talking about. We all have problems. - Exactly. - My kind of problems eat - her kind of problems for breakfast. - Stella! - Wow. - Stop. No, Shaina. - Compared to what we are going through... - Why is everything - always about you, Stella? - Because you know nothing about how hard it can be. You sit there in your ivory tower, getting fat on cakes, and... I’m not fat, okay? I’m pregnant. Is it that obvious already? No. It's not. Wait, you knew? I asked her not to tell anyone. So, what does TK say? Sorry, Faro. I didn’t know. It's okay. So, when are you due? You haven't gone to register? Please, don't start, Shain. Guys, remember Tsitsi? She was in my class a few years ago. She got pregnant and didn't go get checked out. She died in child birth. It's like Granny would say, if you have a choice, and you don't make it, then that in itself is a choice. A few days ago, I had a scare. I thought I got an infection. I thought for a minute it might be some… It's like the whole thing got me thinking about how I’ve been living, what I’ve been doing these last two years. I want to stop. I want to find another way. I’m asking for your help. I can't do it alone, Zo. - I promised Mom and Dad. - Stella. I can get a night job. I can keep up at school. I can help without anyone breaking any promises. Okay? Come here. Eggs over here! Eggs over here! Ma'am, eggs? Ah, thank you. I have salt and pepper. Take what you like. Eggs over here, parents! Please support! I have eggs over here! My brother, eggs? Eggs over here! Eggs over here! I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Naughty rooster. They’re all waiting for you. In you go. Do what you usually do. Come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, TK! So, you don't pick up my calls? Come on. Let's go. That's right. Run! That's how you handle everything! - Run, run, running away! - Stop it, Faro. - Or what? - I’m warning you. Big man warning me! - We need to talk. - No! Okay. Off you go. There we go. There we go. It's your lucky day, big boy. No, don't run. He's gonna give you some nice, fluffy chicks. Who are you? Trying to steal my chickens? They are my chickens. I’m sorry. They're in my yard. They're my chickens now. Sorry, I just… I just wanted to borrow a little time with your rooster. - Who are you? - My name is Shaina. I sell eggs at the taxi rank. Granny, please, these chickens are all I have in the world. Well, that old boy certainly has got enough to go around. You can come in. Thank you, Granny. We have three weeks left until the end of term, people, and perhaps this will inspire you. Who can tell me what this is? It's a water tank, ma'am. That is right. This is part of a water purifying system designed by a form four student. This is a solar-powered fridge that converts heat from the sun into coldness. A traffic light powered by the cars that drive by. All these, they're prize winners from an "All Africa" science competition. And the prize, a bursary to study engineering at a university. There are opportunities out there. It's just a matter of you seeking them out. Because you are the only ones responsible to improve your own lives. Okay, that will be it for today. Go home. Please continue revising, people. Time is short. Peanuts, peanuts… Popcorn, peanuts, peanuts… Rise and Shaina eggs. Rise and Shaina eggs. Fresh and tasty eggs. No, I don't want any. Rise and Shaina eggs, fresh and tasty! I boiled them this morning. Eggs. I’m selling eggs here! I give you three for the price of two! - Eggs, ma'am! - One more to go. Who's going? Who's going? We're leaving! Hi, babe. No, don't go. I just want to buy eggs from you. How much? - I’ll take it for free, okay? - No! No, no ways! No! - Hey! - Hey! Hey, man! What are you trying to do here? Huh? - You are disturbing me! - Come here. Leave! Don't come back! Just leave those. I’ll pay for them. No, it’s fine. It's just one cracked. I can see you're hard-working. I understand. I admire you. But you need to be very careful around here, okay? Come with me. Here, take this. - I can't. - Come on. There's no problem. I've got lots. And besides, you may never know when you need to call your uncle for help. Shaina, you're an entrepreneur now. You need a phone. Thank you. Yeah, so there's my number in there. If you ever see that clown again, just call me. Thank you. I better get back to work. I’m not stopping you. Thanks again. Eggs! I’m selling eggs! Eggs! I’m selling eggs! I got my passport today. So, if things go well for me, you guys need to take care of each other for a few days. I’m going to buy stuff to resell. How did you get this so quickly? I applied for it about a year ago. Mimi, Zororo is in charge when I’m gone. That doesn't mean you can mess around. Zo, you both keep working hard, do you hear me? Yes, Mama. This is for you. I might be gone for a while. You need cash. - Who's this? - A taxi driver I know. He needs help. For weekends and evenings only. Wow, thank you so much, Stella. You're welcome. What do you mean "Gone the way of Faro"? I didn't invent being pregnant. You know that, right? Just think, Faro, if each of them give me three or four chicks, I’ll have between ten and 20 hens. Roosters, even. Faro? Are you okay? It's been a bit rough. Hey. Where are you calling me from? It's none of your business. It is now! Tell me! Okay. Are you working on Saturday? I’ll come by the shop and tell you everything. - Okay, deal. - Deal. Oh no! What have you done, you stupid hens? What? What is it? Oh, man. The hens eat their own eggs? It happens. And once they get a taste for it, it's really hard to stop. No, man. I’m sorry. I have to get the eggs out. I’m gonna need an incubator. So, what’s the problem? Every cent I have is saving for exam fees. So, build it. Busi, I can't do that. Come on, Shain. You've seen them, right? It's a box with a bulb. No, it's much more than that. I’m going to need foam insulation, dividers, switches, - a thermostat, maybe even a humidifier. - You see, I knew it! Do you think that there's anyone else in this place who could just rattle off the bits and pieces like that? Sometimes we have electricity, sometimes we don't. Well, figure out a plan B. And what makes you think I can? Because I know you, Shain, and you're way too determined to just quit. And if you want to become a chicken breeder, you're going to have to get over yourself and just do it. How much? Just take it. - I can't. - Dude, seriously, if she finds out, she's just gonna take it off my wage package, which is zero anyway, so… Oh, hey, I made you something. Just… Not this one… There we go. Faro, this is amazing! Every new business needs a new logo, so I figured I’d just… And then? It’s nothing. Faro, what's going on? How long since your last period? About four months. Why did you take so long coming to see us? Nurse, she's here now. It's important for me to check your blood pressure and your HIV status. So, if you are HIV positive, we can lower the risk of passing it on to the baby. This is going to be a tad bit cold. That's the sound of the baby's heartbeat. Sounds good. Spotting in pregnancy is common, but heavy bleeding is a sign of something serious that could endanger mother and baby's health. So, when did you start spotting? A few days ago. I had an accident. I fell down. Faro. The nurse can't help you if she doesn't know the facts. I fell down. I… Takura, he… Did he hurt you? No. He pushed me, but it was my fault. No. Whatever you did, whatever you said, nothing justifies that. Your friend is wise. You should listen to her. Yes. Sit. Now, there can be many different reasons for bleeding in a pregnancy. It's a good thing that you came to be seen, so that you're not in danger. In this case, it's very mild. But remember, you need to take care of yourself and the baby. Which means avoiding anyone or anything that could cause physical or emotional harm. Do you have a parent that can support you? My mother would freak out. She doesn't know? Do I have to tell her? Sho, homie? Not bad for your first day. You can come again tomorrow. Say, 4 p.m. until late. Don't look. Say nothing. But they're beating the crap out of him. He most probably stole from Simba Dhaya. It's none of our business. Let's go home. I'll see you tomorrow. Cheers. Hello, Uncle. Oh, you're doing incubators now? You just go from strength to strength. That’s my girl. It sounds better than it really is. A business woman growing her own business. I like it. Thank you, Uncle. I’m trying. Hey. Hey, Faro. - Zororo. - Hey, Busi. - Hey. - Happy Birthday! Thank you. I figured I had to bring something nice to join your study group. - Okay, now I’ve heard everything. - What? I’m being serious. I actually don't have anyone to study with, so… Yeah. It's okay. We are doing chemistry. Sit. Welcome. Thank you. And what does one have to do to chillax on the bed? You couldn't do it even if you wanted to. - Really? Try me. - You'd have to get pregnant. Wait, what? You can't tell anyone, Zo. Not a word. You have to swear it. Actually, guys, I’ve decided to tell my mother. Oh! I mean, once the baby is born, he or she will be so cute, your mother… She won't be able to help herself. But it might get rough until then. - Yeah. - And TK? Who is TK? - Hi. - Hey. Here you go. Oh, but this is so beautiful. I’ve kept a hundred just to dish out in my taxis. You're doing it, Shaina. You're on the up and up. So, how are your chickens? - They're pretty good. - Good. Two got fertile, so one is keeping me with boiled eggs and the others should hatch in a few days. That's good. Um, someone's birthday? Mine. I’m 17. Great timing, then. So, you should let me buy you dinner tonight. I mean, a treat for your birthday. Come on, Shain. I’m the only family member you're left with, so I might as well do my duty. Okay. If you insist. Great. So, eight o'clock at The Paradiso? - Okay. - Thank you. You’re welcome. Who the hell was that? Isn't it obvious? It’s the blesser who gave her the phone. Come on. He's not my blesser. He's my uncle. Wait, Simba Dhaya is your uncle? Yeah. He was at my granny’s funeral. - And he owns some taxis at the rank. - Shain, he’s a dangerous man. The best blessers always are. Guys, he’s not dangerous and he’s not my blesser. He’s just a relative who wants to help. So, why don’t you ask him - for the money for exams? - Yeah. I don’t want his money. And that would be weird. But look what he did for me. Now that’s what I’m talking about! Wait, what about your mother, Faro? Couldn’t she help Shain out with a loan? My mother? All you get from her is a long scripture, "Neither a lender nor a borrower be…" Aye! That’s Shakespeare! That’s not the Bible. Come on. Guys, guys, guys, it’s Shain’s birthday. Let’s go have some cake, okay? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ You’re late. How was study group? What’s wrong with you, Faro? Mm? Mama, I’ve got something to tell you. Oh, I don’t like the sound of that. Come. Sit. Yesterday… Yesterday, I went to the clinic and… Are you sick? - No. - What’s wrong? Just let me tell you what’s going on. Mama, I… I’m pregnant. I’m sorry. Sorry? Sorry? You have no idea how sorry you are going to be, my dear. Where is the father of this child? Who is he? Faro! I want to know who’s impregnating schoolgirls. - Takura Chizengeni. - Takura Chizengeni. Right. Go to him. Mama, please, no. - He doesn’t want me. - I want you to go to him! If he’s old enough to… father a child, he’s old enough to take care of its mother. Go! - Mama, please, he doesn’t want me. - What he wants does not matter. You hear me? Out! Mama. Get out, Rufaro. Go. Get out! Out! - Mama, please! - Just go, Rufaro. Mama! Shaina! God, why? Hey, look at you. All grown up. Happy Birthday. Come. Sit. Sorry, I’m late. For a minute, I thought you were going to stand me up. - What are you drinking? - A soft drink is fine. A cool drink for the young lady and another double for me. This reminds me of when my mom made a party for me when I was five. I was dancing with my dad and I was so happy. It’s one of my best memories. Here. Thank you. You know we could make our own memories. This is your night. It's your birthday. I’m allowed to treat you, right? I’m going to go dance. Hey, don’t touch her! She’s with me. Hey, man, leave me alone! - What's wrong with you? - You'll die for nothing! Get away from us! I don’t feel like dancing anymore, Uncle. Hey, don’t call me that. It makes me feel old. I've got an idea. Let’s take selfies to mark the memory. Come on. Look happy. Smile! I want to go home. I don’t feel well. Hey! You only just got here. Relax. Okay, fine, I’ll take you home. - No, it’s fine. I can take a t... - I said I’ll take you home. Thank you, Uncle. Hey! What’s the rush? Hey, Shaina. How about a drink? I mean, one for the road. Sorry, it’s late. I have to get up early in the morning. Look what I found in the car. Our lucky day. Wow! This place really has fallen on hard times. You could have asked me. You know I would have wanted to help, right? Take it. It’s obvious you need it. You’re proud. It’s good to a certain point and then it becomes irritating. Now, dance for me. Please. I said dance! So, you think everything I’ve done for you was all for nothing? And you honestly believe that I don't want anything in return? Is that what you think of me? Is it? Silly. You think you’re smart, huh? Uncle, please! No! Shut up! Shut up! Come on, Shain. We’re going to be late. Shain! There’s more on hydration. And the definition on that page is, "The process whereby irons are surrounded…" Zo? I don’t see how this any of your business, okay? This is between me and Faro. TK, if I can’t tell you that you’re behaving like an idiot, then who will? If my parents find out, they would chuck me out. You know how it is? Her mom already did that to her. You didn’t know? She’s staying over at Busi’s. Hey, you guys. Can we go check if Shain is at her house? Shain! Shaina! I’m going to go check at the back. Shain, are you okay? Fine. I’m just not feeling well. Are you sure? I’ll see you tomorrow. She’s inside, but maybe you can try talk to her. - I have to go. - Okay, thanks. Shain, it’s me, Busi. Zo is gone. Open the door, please, Sha. Shain? It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s all done now. Right, I’m giving you PEP. PEP stands for Post-Exposure Prophylaxes and needs to be started within 72 hours to be effective. If the guy has HIV, this is the stuff that helps you not get it. Now, it’s the antibiotic. It will keep you from getting any STI's. The contraceptive prevents unplanned pregnancies. Have you been to the police yet? We do encourage survivors to report. But the most important thing is to get treatment straight away, like you did. Okay? That’s the one, sir. That's mine. You've done well. Thanks. Thanks, sir. Yes, even that one with the polka dots is mine. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Ah, hey! Where have you been? It’s been a while, hey? I’m sorry. Do I know you? Don’t you remember me? Actually, you know what? I’ve got time, so… - What has changed now? - I’m not into that anymore. Come on. Just one time won’t kill you. Hey! Are you deaf? You heard the lady. - Back off! - Mimi! - Ah, Stella. - Zo, hi. I missed you so much, guys. Look at you. You’re all grown up and got that taxi rank swagger. How are you doing, Mama? I’m well, thanks. Are you Mai Faro? What has she done this time? Faro tells me she’s got no aunts. Which is why I came to you. Well, ours is a small family, sadly. But you are a good mother. You shouldn’t doubt that because of what's happened. I didn’t know. But she was next door, crying. These things happen. Girls want attention and the boys, they use it to get what they want. Mai Faro, motherhood is like cooking sadza. At one point, you’re going to get burned. Am I right? - I suppose so. - We can’t stop eating, right? So, we just have to become better cooks. I’m not sure I follow. Because we must cook to eat. Otherwise, there’s no point. The scars we have, we must live with. Mai Busi, I’m confused. I don’t know where you’re going with your little story. Okay, let me be plain with you, Mrs. Dliwayo. Your daughter needs your support. - She’s just a child. - She is not a child! She is not a child! At her age, I’d already had her for two years. And her father was a married man and refused the pregnancy. To save face, my father gave me that store over there and told me I was on my own. And I was. I served customers with Rufaro on my back. And I had to pay rent each and every month, without fail! And I did. And now it looks like she’s following in your footsteps. She’s supposed to learn from my mistakes, not repeat them. And yet you are repeating the mistakes of your parents. It’s time for us all to stop repeating the mistakes of the past. Be kind and compassionate to one another. Forgiving each other. Just as the Lord forgives us. Faro. You were right, Zo. I was stupid. And now I’ve paid for it. Did he…? Shain? Have you reported this? You know what they'd say, Zo. - I feel so ashamed. - No, Shain. This was not your fault. You should report this to the police, okay? You warned me. - You said... - He's your uncle, Shain. If you can't trust family, then who can you trust? - I went out with him. - And so what? You deserved this because you agreed to go eat a meal with a guy? No, Shain. You cannot blame yourself for this. What's that sound? No way! - Did you build this? - Oh my God. Hello. Oh my goodness. - It's him. - Don't pick up. You don't ever have to speak to him again. What do you want? Hey, there. I just wanted to say thanks for the other night. I had a good time. We must do it again, okay? Don’t you ever, ever call me again! Please get rid of this for me. Do you want me to sell it? I mean, you can use that money to pay for your exams. Sounds like a good idea. Thank you. Let's get this little one some water. Let's get you some water, little one. Hello, my sister. How much are the children’s rompers? See how soft they are? I have a discount price now. Hi, Mama, we have baby clothes, braids. Everything you need is here at discount prices... These are not for me, my dear. Hi, I’m selling toys. How's it going? Can I help you? No, I’m just looking. You have some nerve coming here. What are you thinking? After the way you treated my daughter, - Mom? - You think you can waltz in here… What? He has no business here. What does he want? - Mom... - No! He should not be in my shop. Just give me a moment. Please? What are you doing here? I… I don't know. - I just... - Do you want to be part of this child's life? Yeah, I guess. You guess? You’re gonna have to do a lot better than that. Do your parents know? Have you told them? - My parents? - Did I stutter? Yes, your parents. Do they know you fathered a child, Takura? My dad would kill me. Look, if you want to be part of this child's life, you have to be committed. Okay? It's all or it's nothing. And if you don't have the balls to come clean, then you're just not man enough to be the father of this child. And I can raise this baby by myself, okay? Faro, wait. Hi, guys. I need to get you guys one by one. Come on. Come, come, come, come. Oh Come here. And the last one. Come on. There we go. - Excuse me! - Good afternoon! - Hello. - Hmm. How may I help you? I’m Constable Maxwell and this is Constable Mathias. There's an investigation that we are working on, and we were hoping you will be able to assist us. Did the nurse contact you? What nurse? Wait. What's this about? There's a businessman who reported that his cellphone was stolen by the taxi rank where you sell eggs. No, wait. He gave me that phone. You don't deny having it? I did. Not anymore. Where is it? A friend of mine took it to sell. You sell every gift that you’ve been given? I think this is not a good place to talk. Maybe you must just come with us to the police station. No! I didn’t do anything wrong! - No! He gave me that phone. - Just come with us… - I didn’t do anything. - Hey. Leave me! I did nothing! No! - What's going on? - Please take care of my chicks! Mimi! Please give them some water. I’ll be back soon. - Okay. - I’ll be back soon. The complainant is going to come identify you and then we press charges. Simba Dhaya is coming here? Yes. So you know him? He's a relative. He… Why did you steal the phone? - I asked you a question. - Wait. There is something you were about to say, my sister? Speak freely. Don’t be afraid. He… He raped… He raped me. Say that again? He raped me. You were caught stealing his phone. Now you accuse him? Nonsense! Why didn’t you report it earlier? Why? I’m reporting it now. Thank you. Hi, I’m Simba Dhaya, looking for Constable Mathias. I’ll check. Hey, that's her! That's the girl who stole my phone! Wait! - You gave me that phone. - She's lying. I don’t even know this girl. All I know is that she sells eggs at the rank and that’s it! - Ah, Mr. Dhaya. - Busi. Hi. Thanks for coming. Go get my phone from Zo at the rank. Bring it as soon as you can. Okay. Constable, won't you please take this young lady to the back? Yeah, sure. See you just now. All right, come with me. Mr. Dhaya, please step into the interrogation room. - For what? - Oh, just a few questions. Okay, fine. One minute. Do you know a place called The Paradiso? Of course I do. Who doesn't? Have you ever been there? Yeah, since I was a teenager. What is this all about? Good afternoon. Have you seen Zo? Stop being lazy here, okay? - Hello. - Hello. Have you seen Zo? Zoro? Zoro is that new boy? Have you seen him? What the hell has this got to do with my stolen phone? The girl in question claims that you raped her. Of course she does. She's just trying to wiggle out of trouble. She says that you took her there for her birthday. And that's where this whole debacle comes from. Officer. I’ve already told you, I don't know the girl. So you won't mind answering a few of my questions? Zo! Zo, Shain needs you. She’s been arrested. Arrested? Do you have the phone? Quick! It’s urgent! But she told me to sell it. - Who did you sell it to? - No, I didn't. I want to get a few pictures off it first. Come in, come in, come in. Am I under arrest? No, Mr. Dhaya. You can go, Mr. Dhaya. Turn right in front. There, turn right! Right in front! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! Get out of here! There you are, Mathias. Would you please educate your friend here that if he starts interrogating someone who has come to report a case, soon enough, he will find himself with nothing to do? Unless, of course, that's what he wants. Sorry to keep you, Mr. Dhaya. Don't worry about it. As long as that foolish girl learns a lesson, I’m sure we’re okay. I’m sure she will. Mr. Dhaya? And who are you? We were there when you came to her house to drop off the flyers. I’ve already told you I don't know the girl! Then why are there pictures of the two of you in this phone? Let me have a look at that. Mr. Dhaya, I think you might want to step into my interrogation room there and revise your statement. What's the meaning of this? Simba Dhaya, I’m placing you under arrest. This is nonsense, man! Take him away. No, man. Mathias! Mathias! - Mathias! - Let's go. Mathias! Mathias! Thanks, Mama. You won't regret it. - Okay. - Sharp, Mama. Thank you. - Stella. - Shain! Oh my! Wow! They let you out? For a minute there, I thought I was headed straight for Chikurubi. But welcome home. How's business? Well, I’ll have to make another trip soon. - That good? - It's your chicks. The kids can't stay away. And they bring their parents, so I can get a chance to work my sales pitch. Then get some money. I want to buy these ones and any more you have. I need lots and lots of chicks. Well, it’s just these five for now. The rest haven't hatched. When they do hatch, they're mine. I’ll put a down payment. Are you serious? Those fluffy, little balls are helping me, Shain. You've got to spend money to make money, right? Yeah. Okay, how about I make you a deal? You can rent them. While they’re still cute. And then, when they get all gangly and awkward, then I can take them back to sell them. Sounds perfect. But why don't I help you pay your exam fees? And in return, you keep me covered in those fluffy gold feathers for the rest of the year? Deal. - I missed you so much, Stella! - I missed you too! I really wish you were here today, Granny. Hello, Mama. What can I get for you? Three eggs. Hi, guys. Hi, Shain. How are you? Wow! - So, partner, how's business going? - Yes? So far so good. Ouch! Did you get burned by sadza? What's funny, Mama? It's an old joke. Faro. - Good day. - Daddy is here. Let's go to Daddy. Are they together now? No, but he’s taken responsibility. And like Faro always says, "A woman might not need a man, but a child definitely needs their father." She's very bright. She takes after her mother. Take one from this side, where you can see the eggs nicely. And what are you two up to? Just taking some pictures to inspire this year's A-level students. Show them what you can achieve if you just believe in yourself. - You don't mind, do you? - No. She's come a long way. The incubator that earned you a scholarship. It wouldn’t have earned me anything if this guy hadn’t entered a sneaky application on the sly. Nah, you just needed a little push. You need a little push. How is university going, Shain? It's okay. A lot of work though. She's acing it, ma'am. She's just being humble. She's shining! Subtitle translation by: Antoinette Smit
