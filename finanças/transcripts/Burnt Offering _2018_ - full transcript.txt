Martha, do you know why Naomi was in the penance room? - Yes. - Yes, and yet, you still released her. - Yes. - This death is your responsibility. This boy's blood is on your hands. - You're the one holding the knife. - You know, I find it interesting that the first person to promise not to say anything is usually the first person to open their mouth to show that saying anything is the first thing that they'd do. You know, Naomi here had problems saying things too. But we fixed that didn't we dear. You still have a lot of work to do with your self control. Martha, Martha! Take Naomi, and go to your room, and get cleaned up and wait for me in the sanctuary. Understood? - Yes. - Go, go! Are you both aware that trespassing, vandalism, and drug use are criminal offenses?
