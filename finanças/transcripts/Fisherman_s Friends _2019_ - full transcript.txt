You got school today, my love. Lessons to learn. They can't teach me how to bait a lobster pot. I think your mother might use me as bait if I let you play hooky. Now, here. I'll take you out on Saturday. All right? Go on. What the bloody hell's going on down here, Jago? I can't find her. A grown man... wandering around... with a pixie in his pocket needs his head examining. Hey, you won't say that when I'm dragged down to Davy Jones' locker. Well, at least I'll get a decent night's sleep. Here! Have a good day, my darlin' maid. 'Tis still the middle of the bleedin' night. - Ahh. - Oh, no! Here, let me give you a hand with that, Father. All set, Jim. Good lad. Here he is, just like clockwork. Turns up when all the work's done. - What time do you call this then? - Ungodly! Here. Dad and I found another song last night. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What's that, then? - "Nelson's Blood." - Love song, is it? - Oh, no. Not quite. So, apparently, at the Battle of Trafalgar, they had to put Lord Nelson's corpse in a big, bloody barrel of brandy. What did they use? Martell or Courvoisier? A big word for this time of day, innit?

See, what I don't get, is why a smart-arse lawyer wouldn't insist on a prenup. It's called trust, Danny. Is that why Abigail didn't trust you to go to Vegas? She did. She just didn't trust you guys to take care of me. No, sailing a yacht out into the wide blue yonder. That's much more of a buzz. If you ever hear me say that, fly me to Switzerland and check me into the euthanasia clinic, pronto. With pleasure, mate. You're just cynical because you've not met the right girl yet, Danny. No. It's because monogamy... It isn't natural. That is... That is right. That is right. In mammals, it is practically non-existent. What about penguins? They mate for life. I saw it on a documentary on Animal Planet. Penguins live on the South Pole, Henry, where it's a hundred below zero. No way they're gonna get their crown jewels out for a bit on the side. For them, monogamy is all about keeping their bollocks warm. - ♪ Ooh ♪ - ♪ I'm gonna get me some ♪ ♪ Sippin' all day on Coke and rum ♪ ♪ Somebody tell the sun ♪ ♪ I'm ready to burn and have some fun ♪ Come on.

Yeah, I'm amazed he got a licence considering he's visually impaired. - It's a one-way street. - What? Sorry about that. We're from out of town. Yeah, you don't say. Only an idiot would bring that thing down here. Oh, nothing to do with the bright spark who designed a road system that's too narrow to drive down. Yeah, how short-sighted of the 17th century town planner not to account for that cock extension. You're gonna have to back up. What a tosser. What's a... tosser? Well... So let's have a toast, ay?

Who's Sir Walter Raleigh? Some wanker from London. Apparently, they're staying up at Charles Montegue's place. Huh? Damn bloody emmets. Coming down here like they own the place with their second homes, and... only visit twice a bloody year. Gives us two chances to take their money, son. If it were down to me, we'd have toll booths on every road crossing the River Tamar. That's what they do in Wales. Charge the buggers for the privilege of coming in. Hey, you get any more militant, my son, you'll have to join the Cornish National Liberation Army. - I never left, Father. - Good boy. - Hello, gentlemen. - How are you? - Four pints of lager, please. - Lager? I'm afraid we don't have much call for fizzy drinks this time of year. We've got Tribute, Proper Job and guest ale, Bishop's Finger. Do we know where it's been? That was good, man. That was good. No. But I got a pretty good idea where he could stick it. Oh, here he is. Captain Pugwash. - Don't shout. - Morning, chaps. Slight change of plan, I'm afraid. We won't be casting off or trimming the jib today. Is that a euphemism? No, the boat's stuck in Milford Haven with a ripped sail. - Where's Milford Haven? - Wales. - How we gettin' there? - We're not, Driss. You're telling me I gave up a seat at the roulette table in the Bellagio for a weekend yachting, and we don't have a yacht? Correct. Well, what are we gonna do instead? Whoa! It's last man standing! Hey, guys. I'm getting the hang of this. Oh, oh, New York, here I come! - No sign of those numpties? - No. - When were they due back? - About two hours ago. - We've gotta get those boards. - I am staying on dry land. Another 20 minutes, and there won't be any! Hey, hey. You can get that one. Get that one. I'm not sure. I'll try. Henry, no. He's gonna fall and crack his head open. - Danny, he could get that one. - I'm gonna fall... - No, he can get it. - Help! Jago, I need you to come and help me get these sheets off the line. He's a fisherman, Maggie, not a bloody chambermaid. This has to be the worst stag do of all time. Christ, we've got a shout! Where's me pager, Maggie? Don't ask me. I'm a barmaid, not a Lifeboat Operations Manager. - What we got? - Three men in the water off Tag's Pit! Dig! Dig! - Over here! - Boat! Help! All right now. Stay calm. Wait. - One at a time! - Move. Move. - One at a time! - Careful. Get up. Get up. All right. You. Get on. Oh, thank you so much. I thought we were goners. Here, ladies. You forgot your handbag. Oof. Oh. We're on a stag do. You're never gonna get to the wedding if you carry on like that. - Take it easy, Jim. - Well, they're hangin'. All of 'em. Probably been on the wacky backy too. - Wacky backy? - Jim, come on. Well, why else would they drag us out on a day like this? Hey, relax, chief. We come in peace, man. Okay? Chief? Hey, listen. We're just not used to the ocean, all right? You'd do well to show her a bit of respect. - Oh, shit! - What? Driss! Help! Help! Help. Port Isaac, this is Whisky Bravo 178. We've a fix one kilometre south-west of Tag's Pit. Getting quite badly burned, so... take your time. Over. One, two, testing. One, two. One, two, one, two, one, two. I thought we was having a sing-song, not putting on a bloody rock concert. You're not here to hide, Jago. You're here to be heard. Thank you, Yoko Ono. - I shall be listening. - I know you will. See you, Sal. Can't keep ignoring the bank, Rowan. You need to call them. I'm not sure what to say. This came from the Inland Revenue. I am not the pheasant plucker. I'm the pheasant plucker's mate. And I'm only plucking pheasants 'cause the pheasant plucker's late. I'm only fucking pheas... No, I... I can't get my tongue round it! Well, that's not what Rowan's been telling everyone. Get off me, you great arse! Here, do you two want to get a room or shall we get on with it, eh? Ooh! Ladies and gentlemen, we're the Fisherman's Friends. We all hail from Port Isaac, and the songs we're singing today are about sailors and the sea. These songs come from a time when sailors were clapped in irons, hung from the highest yardarm, nailed to the mast, shanghaied, wanghaied... - Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. - What? Here? - Yeah, here. Right here. Pull in. - Why? ...rum, bum, buggered, blinded... And that was all before they set sail. Jim over there, he's been sufferin' from a sore throat. Sounds nasty. Have you consulted your health care professional about it? Yes, I have, son. Well, if the antibiotics don't work, you can always suck on a Fisherman's Friend. Oh.

Um, just out of interest, what kind of music were they singing? The rock 'n' roll of 1752. - That'll be 38 pound, fifty. - Ta, my lover. - I'll get these. - Oh, thank you. Well, you saved our lives yesterday. It's the least I could do. I'd like to talk to you and the boys about the future of the group. - Future? - Yeah. I manage bands, and I'm interested in representing you. You'd better come and talk to the boys. For your information, my Jago is the Roger Daltry of the group. Well, I'll bear that in mind. Here, you'll never guess what. - Our boys have just been talent-spotted. - By who? Your admirer. Apparently, he's some kind of big shot in the music industry. Watching you sing was one of those... rare moments in the music business when you realise you are witnessing something truly original. The bottom line is... you've got a unique sound. And we believe we can help you get it released by a major label. You can't be... Now, all right, all right. Now look, look, look. I'm serious. So how's about we crack open the champagne and get this deal done? Right here. Right now. Hang on. You mean this is for real? Thanks for the offer, son, but we're just fishermen, see. We have no need to sell our souls for 15 minutes of fame. Especially to an emmet. An emmet? It's old Cornish for an ant. Something that invades in large numbers, causes great irritation and is a helluva job to get rid of. Now, if you don't mind... some of us have got some real work to do. Thanks for your time. Where's the...? Oh. Come on. Fuck it. Just one bar. The only place you'll get reception down here is on the sea wall. Way out there? - Is that Danny? - Mmm. Is that... Wait. All right. All right. All right, get it. Hey, Danny, what's going on, man? Where the bloody hell have you parked the car? - Ah, sorry, bro. We had to peel out. - Eh? - Major, major crisis. - Well, what about this major crisis? Look, you never leave a man behind enemy lines. First rule of war! First rule of rock 'n' roll, don't forget the money. As soon as they've signed, we'll get you out of there. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but they ain't signing anything, mate. - Hello? - Oh, oh, Danny. Hello? I'm... I'm sorry. Have-Have you lost your touch? No. These guys aren't interested in fame and fortune. Hey, hey. Everybody's interested in fame and fortune. So do your job and close the deal. I don't want to wake up and find out somebody else has beat us to it. Hello. Hello? Shit. Ooh. Hold up! Whoa, whoa. Hold up. What's it gonna take to get you boys over the line, eh? Sorry, Danny. It isn't going to happen. For me, Leadville and Rowan 'tis a dream come true, but... but me boy and a few others ain't so keen. We don't need the others, Jago. Five is more than enough. In fact, five is the magic number when it comes to any boy band. You know, look at, er, the Jackson Five, Take That. Now, we got to stick together down here, one an' all. That's the difference between sinking or swimming in a place like this. Yup, the only way this'll work is if you manage to convince Jim. Well, how do I do that? There's an old Corny saying. You never know a man till you find out what his legs is made of at sea. Where's the lift? I thought I'd made my position perfectly clear. You did, but us ants are tricky to get rid of. Hello, darling'. Jago said there may be room at the inn. Yeah, you... You'd have to ask my daughter about that. She runs the B & B side of things. Tam, could you go and fetch your mother, please. Thanks, darling. Mam! The tosser's at the door! Yeah? Tosser. Hello again. I'm looking for a room. I'm sorry. We're full. Well, that's... not what it says on the sign. Look. It's just for one night, and I've got an early start. Severe gale nine... to violent storm eleven. Rain then squally showers. Poor becoming moderate. Jersey... Mr Anderson. You're waking up the other guests. Mr Anderson. Mr Anderson! Oh! Oh! Your wake-up call. Oh, er... What is it? I'm coming! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pull up the anchor. I'm here. Sorry I'm late. What have you come as, then? We're going fishing, son, not competing in The America's Cup. You're gonna have to change that jumper, boy. Fishermen don't wear green. Makes the boat seek land. And don't whistle on board. To whistle is to challenge the wind herself. She might whip up a proper storm. - Anything else? - Yeah, turn starboard after leaving the dock.

No, just makes it smell sweeter when it comes up. Oh, oh. Here, answer me this, then. What I don't understand... is why anyone would wanna part with their hard-earned cash to buy a record sung by ten hairy-ass fishermen. Because deep down, there's a sailor in all of us. There's never been a sailor in me! Your songs... transport the listener to distant shores... and allows them to return stronger and braver than they've ever felt before. I never thought I'd say this to anyone, but I think you talk more bollocks than my wife. God rest her soul. Look, what I'm proposing is that you come up to London, record a demo so the labels have got something to hear. We can't go on a jolly like that, we got lobster to catch. Well, okay. Then, we'll record it down here. Duke Management will cover all your expenses. Is there any money in it for us? Well, if we're lucky enough to land a deal, yeah. Not a fortune, mind you, but, you know, definitely enough to go on a nice holiday. Maggie Googled him. He is who he says he is. Sally reckons he's a proper big shot. Proper big mouth, more like. Come on, Dad. You always told me, "Never trust an emmet," and I've never met one yet who could prove you wrong. Listen, son. One thing I've learned in my old age. It ain't so much black and white as them an' us. We have to take every man on his own merit. Yeah. We might even make money out of it. Come on, Rowan. It's a bloody pipe dream, and you know it. Right now, I'll give anything a shot. Ooh. No charge for the wake-up call then? All part of the service. I'll make sure I mention it in my Trip Advisor review. Mr Anderson, I'm glad I caught you. - Can we have a word? - Yeah. Come on in. Sit down. Here. Ah, now. Now... just for clarity's sake... if we did agree to let you manage us... you'd have to understand that our real work comes first. Now we, we got boats, businesses to run and... and they'd have to... be looked after before anything else. Absolutely. And you'd have to promise you wouldn't take the piss. Now, we've got our ways down here. And once you cross the River Tamar, you're not in England any more. We're a land apart. Now you-you get my drift, son? I give you my word. Good. 'Cause down here... a man's word is... strong as Cornish oak. - Danny's on line three. - All right, put him through. If it isn't the Pirate of Penzance! Yeah. I forgot what a gifted comedian you are, Troy. Danny, have you plundered the village and found any hidden treasures? I did indeed, Henry. Not only have I persuaded all ten fishermen to sign on the dotted line, they're also up for recording a demo. Oh, my God. Oh! I cannot believe you fell for that! You knobber! What? Danny, it was a joke, bro! Do you really think we would sign a boy band with a combined age of 653? You bastards. Now, I suggest you tear up that contract and get yourself back within the M25 where you belong. - I can't. - Why? I've given them my word. When did that ever count for anything? Hi, there. I'm impressed. You are? Can't believe you got 'em to give up a day's fishing. Yeah. I just hope you make all this bother worth their while. Well, that's the plan.

But things have changed. Listen, I was reading up on sea shanties, and you're right. They do have universal appeal. I mean, after all, maritime work songs were the rock 'n' roll of 1752. Has all the ocean air gone to your head? All right, maybe. But I genuinely think these guys have got something to say. I'm recording one more song, then I've got an album to send out to the labels. - Let them be the judge. - Hey! Hey! This has gone far enough, Danny. I want you back at your desk... after Henry's wedding to deal with the acts that actually make us commission! What's wrong? Danny's gone native. Come in. Hiya. Helping your mum with her homework? We're doing kings and queens of England. My favourite is King Canute. That's the one who stopped the tide, and then the tide won and he got soaked, right? Yeah, what an idiot. Everyone knows you can't stop the sea. Um, I just wanted to ask about those photographs of the fishermen in the hallway. Er, you don't happen to know who took them? I did. Seriously? Well, they're fantastic. Thank you. It would be great if we had some pictures of them to send out with the demo. I don't suppose you'd be interested? Yeah. What were you thinking? Well, something with a nautical theme that would stand out in a supermarket checkout. Sounds a bit naff. Well, to be fair, I haven't really given it much thought. Well, if you're interested in capturing who they really are, that's something I can do.

Elvis. - It's the Beatles. - It's Elvis. - Well, which is it? - Dad, it's Elvis. - Put Elvis. - Three. I thought this was your specialist subject? So did I. "Sorrow Is A Woman" was on which album? All Through The Night! Hang on a minute. They got a bloody ringer on their team. Well, they can ask to have another member if they want. You'd be better off sorting out your own team, you miserable lot of town crows. Lost control of your wife again, yarnigoat? - Jim. - Dad! - Jim! - Dad, leave it. Sit back down! Before I put you right on your arse! I done it before, Trieve. I would be so happy to do it again. Now, calm yourself down, lads. None of us wants to be hauled up back in front of the magistrate. Come on, my darling. Sit down, sweetheart. Come on. Sit down, love. I take it being called a yarnigoat isn't a term of endearment. No. Far from it. I mean, the people from Padstow think that we spend most of our time telling yarns. And we call them town crows because all they do is strut about town crowing about how many fish they caught. Ah. So the goats and the crows, eh? - A bit like the Sharks and the Jets. - Yeah, well, bloodier. Because back in the 1700s, they used to send press gangs over here to grab our boys and send them to the King's Navy. Ah. But it's also a bit more personal than that. Ah? The guy that my dad was threatening, he used to be my father-in-law. So, you were sleeping with the enemy. Yeah, you could say that. So, how long were you with him? Nearly five years. It was a really painful breakup, but... at least Tamsyn doesn't have to compete with another child any more. - What about you? - Hmm? You ever been married? Yeah, to the job. Thanks. I should go up. Early start for the school run. Who was the first artist to have a posthumous number one in the UK? Otis Redding. "Dock of the Bay," 1968. Night, Danny. - Night, Dad. - Night, my love. Fancy a nightcap, man? Yeah, yeah. Certainly beats the sounds of the city. Yeah. You... You got a girlfriend up there, or what, then? No. Yeah. I'm yet to meet someone who'll put up with me. Right. Saves you getting hurt, mind? Well. That's, uh... That's me, then. Night, Jim. Okay, just check you've got your math book... All right. Come on, then. With the pub running at such a loss, I don't see you've got any choice but to consider selling up. You know as well as anyone how much the pub means to the village. I do. But you've got to consider what's best for your family, Rowan. All right, Father. - How's my little mermaid then, eh? - Fine. Go and see your great granfer, go on. Hey, princess! Why didn't she spend the weekend with her dad? He didn't show up again. What kind of man does that? The kind I decided not to spend my life with. Tamsyn, come on, darling. Be a good girl, all right? Say, "Bye." - They drink you dry last night? - Yeah. Jago was the last man standing. Swaying, but standing. Catch you later. - Danny? - Yeah? Have you got time for a quick chat? Yeah, sure. Come in, mate. I tried re-mortgaging, but they won't accept. It's not surprising, seeing as we aren't making much profit, any profit, in fact. Then, your solicitor is probably right about selling up. What about the band? I mean, could we make some money if it went well? Even if we do manage to secure a record deal... anything the band makes, you've got to split ten ways. Look. I might know someone who'd be interested in buying the pub, if you were willing to do a private sale. Cut out the middle man and all that. It's not that easy. This has always been the heart of our village. It means a lot to a lot of people. In my experience, Rowan, emotions... They have no place in business. Danny, my man on the ground. I was just about to call you for some local intel. Why, what's up? Abigail's morphed into bridezilla. We need a UN peacekeeping envoy to solve the seating plan and we've just lost the official wedding photographers. Well, I think I can probably help you out with the photos. That would be great. One more thing... Abigail keeps bugging me about having the Fishermen sing at the reception. Seriously? She wants to give our guests a flavour of the real Cornwall. I don't know. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Listen, the reason why I'm calling you, yeah... I've just had a tip-off. The village pub is coming up for sale. I thought it might interest your father-in-law. Nice spot. I'll speak to him about it this evening. - See you now. Bye. - Thanks, Danny. Heads up, lads. Good news. I've got you your first professional gig. Ah-ah. Before you get too excited, it's only local. A place called Rock. That ain't local 'round here. Our head of Business Affairs is getting married there. - We look like wedding singers to you? - A lot of powerful people from the music industry will be there. Could be a great opportunity for a showcase. Well, all right. We won't be taking any requests, mind. Come on, Dad. Give us a hand. Good man. Okay, big smile. Okay, this time looking at me. Gentlemen, you're gonna step over here. That way? That way. - Facing in. - This way? And then all are facing in the same direction. Wait, let me just check. Oh, no, you're good. Big smiles. Lobbers Point. Men in the water. Hey. Hey, listen. I'm no photographer, but I can picture me and you together. Seriously, that's an image that will never be captured. Well, that's a big bloody tent. Must have cost a bit. Henry passed on the details of the Golden Lion. I have to say, I'm surprised the family are thinking of selling up. The bloke's desperate. - And when's he thinking of off-loading it? - The sooner the better. And your finder's fee? Two per cent. One and a half, - you've got yourself a deal. - Done. I'll be in contact. - Lovely. - Enjoy the wedding. All right. Grab my arm. Where's everyone else? They have something more important to do. Jago, you're singing in front of some big players here. What can be more important than that? Saving lives, Danny. Yeah, okay. - You're sure you can handle the crowd? - 'Course he can. He's Port Isaac's number one bingo caller. Testing. One, two. One, two. Hello, Kensington-on-Sea. We've played to uglier audiences, but I can't recall one right now. Bloody hell. They're a miserable bunch, inum? Danny, what the hell is going on here?

All right? Trust me. I've heard them sing with genuine passion about something we've all lost. The only thing you appear to have lost is your mind. I'm talking about a way of life. A sense of community that I didn't even know existed any more. I don't know what you've been smoking, and quite frankly, I don't care. But as your boss, I am commanding you to get rid of them now. Legally, you can't do that. - Really? - Yeah. Our arrangement is that I have full control over every artist I sign. Yes. - Besides... - Danny. I've already sent the album out to the labels. You did what? You... I have to go. Something's gone wrong on the rescue. Apparently, Dad went in the water. Is he okay? They're calling the coastguard, but they're bringing him in now. Come on, darling. Come on. Let's go. I'll come with you. Father. Dad, are you okay? Sea mist came in. The navigation system failed. Boat ended up on the rocks at Lobber point. Broke up in minutes. By the time we got there, there were two in the water. Now, we got 'em both out, mind. We must get you to the hospital now, Mr Trevellion. You've had a nasty knock to the head. Suspected concussion. Time for being brave is over. Dad, just do as they ask. - Enough. I'm going home. - Jim. - Uh, Mr Trevellion. - Dad. Stubborn! Your dad is one of the toughest blokes I know. - Sorry we let you down, Danny. - How'd it go? They did you proud. Oh! Hello, Tamsyn. What you doing sitting out here on your own?

How long before you're back out on the boat? Directly. Directly? Yeah, it's like mañana. Only slower. - Granfer? - Yeah? My dad's not coming, is he? No, I don't think he is, sweetheart, but... Maybe he just got held up. That's all, eh? How about we go and ask your mum if there's summat we can all do together instead? - Okay. - Yeah?

The song they were singing was about prostitution. Yes. So was "Roxanne." That didn't work out too badly for Sting. Look, come on, Leah. We may live in the age of The X Factor, but what that show has taught us is that the public love to see real people with real talent. And it doesn't get any more real than singing fishermen who risk their lives out at sea every day. I mean, think of the marketing angles. You won't just be signing a new act. You'll be signing 500 years of naval history. I'm sorry, Danny. You know how much ongoing business we've got with Troy. If I take a punt on Popeye and his pals, I'd risk jeopardising that. All I'm asking for is a basic one-album deal. You'll spend less on this than you would on a music video for one of your A-list artists. - I'm sorry, Danny. - Leah. Maybe next time. Don't be too hard on yourself, Danny. You give it your best shot. Wasn't good enough though, was it, Jago? Hello, Danny? Afternoon, Sian. That was fantastic. Shame the powers that be didn't think so. Well, I've got a TV show that are looking for someone to step in and sing the national anthem for the queen's birthday next week. We've had a last-minute dropout, if you're interested. Let me run it past the boys. Look, I know this isn't what we had in mind, but this could be a golden opportunity to reach a wider audience. Jim, at least consider it.

Mother always said I'd be a late bloomer. Not this bloody late. For 15 years they've sung sea shanties in their local pub in Port Isaac. But one night the group's performance caught the ears of a music manager who was here on holiday. As soon as I heard them, I knew they could be huge. In a world saturated with manufactured pop bands, the Fishermen are a real catch. One minute you're watching Britain's Got Talent, wondering what it's like to be famous. The next minute you're asking your husband for his autograph! What's special about the ten of us is that we're all born and raised here. Sea shanties have been passed down in our families from generation to generation. We've known each other since we were knee-high. Makes the bond unbreakable. We disagree over things, but then they all realise I'm right, they're wrong, and we get on with it. The Fisherman's Friends say they're just ordinary men who've never sought fame, money, or a record deal. Now they have all three. Let's see if this unlikely boy band can climb the charts as well as they can climb the rigging. Eh? I thought you said they'd interviewed everyone. - They did. - How come my Jago wasn't on the telly? Some faces are only made for the radio, Maggie. Here. They say you can tell a man by the company he keeps. So lookin' round at you party, I ain't surprised me reputation's in tatters. But, uh, seriously though... I've known most of ees since you was this high. I've helped some of you learn to walk, talk, fish, and, in a few cases, sing. But you've given me back so much more than I can... - that I could ever... - Oh, Dad. Come on, guys. I... I'd like to say a few words, if he can't. When we first devised the plan to escape the wives once a week for rehearsal... Speak for yourself, boy. ...all those years ago, none of us would ever have believed we'd end up with a record deal. I-I-I was the most sceptical, I will admit that, of anyone here. It's all been down to the... the tenacity and belief of one man. - Danny Anderson. - Yeah! So I'll make a toast. To old friends and new. Old friends and new! Is that Jago? Mm-hmm. And Rowan's dad, Kenwyn. That's outside the old lifeboat station. They were both part of the same crew that answered an emergency call at Hawker's Cove. And during the rescue, a freak wave hit the lifeboat and capsized it. They were the only two members to survive. Well, Kenwyn never got over it. He didn't go out to sea again. And then when the village was granted a new lifeboat house, then Kenwyn bought the old one and turned it into the Golden Lion. That's why it's so important to us all. - Danny. - Henry? I really need to get hold of your father-in-law. Incommunicado, I'm afraid. He's sailing in Barbados. Don't worry. Last I heard the deal had gone through. Right. Jago? Your meals on wheels have arrived, love. All right for some, isn't it, eh? Sneaking in a little siesta. Jago. Playin' silly buggers. Oh. Oh, God.

I wanted to tell you, but what with the band and the baby and... well, then your father, I... - Th-There just hasn't been a right moment. - Who bought it then? Charles Montegue. You sold it to that grabbin' bastard? 'Twas his ancestors who drove us overseas and down the bloody mines. He offered a fair price, and he promised to keep it as a pub. You've been a damn fool, Rowan. Businessman like Charles Montegue... he's not gonna want to keep this place as it is. He's gonna want to make a tidy profit out of it. That'll probably mean turning it into one of them boutique hotels or summat. There'll be no place here for us. You do know that, don't you? Well, that's not true. Is it, Danny? - What's it got to do with Danny? - Well, he made the introduction. Rowan came to me for business advice. He was in an impossible situation. Oh, you... you went to an emmet?

I was just trying to help. You're only sorry because you were found out. You're just full of showbiz bullshit, aren't you, son? Huh? With your million-pound record deals and your fake handshakes and all that. Jim, look. Listen, just hear me out. When I spoke to Rowan, I didn't know anything about the pub, its history, or what it means to the community. But you know now because I told you. Yeah, but by then the deal had already gone through. So you were getting a cut, were you? And you didn't want to risk losing your commission. No, Alwyn, wait. Alwyn! Let me explain! Alwyn, please, just hear me out! Keep your voice down. Go away, Danny. I'm not interested in anything you've got to say. No, wait, wait! Look, um... I-I-I'm gonna talk to Charles. I-I'll make sure things don't change. Everything's changed. Cornish oak, my ass. Your word is like... It's like willow... blowing in the wind. Yeah. I warned you not to take the piss out of us. And I warned you not to hurt my daughter. It wasn't intentional, Jim. I promise. I think it might be time for you to leave, Danny.

Because I'd like something else instead. Come on, Dad. This isn't the time to be stubborn. It's Rowan and Sally's last day at the pub. No, I'm... I'm in no mood for a drink. Don't you think you've made your point? Rowan has torn the heart out of this village. The heart of the village isn't the pub, Dad. It's the people. I owe you an apology, Rowan. I-I've been a stubborn fool. You did what you did for the sake of your family, and I should never have let that come between us. I'm sorry. One and all? One and all. - The usual? - Yeah. That's more like it, mate. Come on. Come on! Top 40's on in a minute. I'd tune into the top 400 if I were you. - Dad! - Don't be such a pessimist! Danny! Tamsyn. Oh. I missed you. What you doing here then? I came here to tell you that the pub is gonna remain the way it always has been. How's that possible? Because I bought it. Well, in case you've forgotten, we're not too fond of second-home owners round here. Well, that's good, because I've only got one. I gave Charles Montegue my London flat in exchange for this. And I'd like Rowan and Sally to keep it running. Did you hear that? Alwyn, wait. Alwyn, uh, wait. - Wait, please. - What are you doing, Danny? Just because you made things right with the pub, that doesn't mean you made things right with me. I'm not expecting anything. I want you to know that I've done a lot of thinking over the last few months. Everything I thought I cared about... money, status, the flat, the cars, the toys... none of them have ever made me happy. But being down here with you and Tamsyn did. Come on, you two! You're missing the countdown. Come on! Come on. At number 12, "Eighty Not Out" from James Last. Number 11, down one, "Lungs" by Florence and the Machine. Number 10, down three, Paolo Nutini's "Sunny Side Up." Number nine, and a new entry.
