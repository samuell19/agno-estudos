Yeah. No, I keep waking up early, that's all. Mm-hmm. And what are you thinking about, Mr. Music Teacher? I'm just saying I don't mind waking up early, so, you know, you don't need to worry about me. [Chris chuckles] Who says I'm worried? [exhales sharply] You know, maybe today will be the day that these kids try to learn something new. [keys jingling] Hush. You know those kids love you. Go show them how it's done, rock star. Yeah. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Bye. [door opens and closes] [man on radio] He broke out of rehab. Can you believe that? Two weeks left on his mandate and he just bails? Two weeks! Now, listen, I love Ian Ford. I'm not one to preach about healthy lifestyle or anything like that, but I feel like this guy has a death wish. Fuck. Shit. - Ian, wake up. - Huh? [Bolt] Hey. Stay awake. Fuck you, mother. [Bolt] Hey, stay awake, okay? We're almost there. Come on. [rock music on stereo] Turn that shit off! - Stop it! - Turn it off! Ah, f... Stop it. Stop it. Just... Let the quiet play. Always the poet. [Sarah laughs] [upbeat orchestra music] Is this the house? [Ian grunts] Yeah. That's it. I thought it'd be bigger. [car doors close] [knocking on door] [orchestra music continues] [Ian] Hi. Mm... You're, um, not Josh. Uh, I'm his wife. I know who you are. You're the... wife? Ma'am, can we come in? We've been driving all day. [door closes] [slurring] [Chris] Oh... [Ian] Wife? [Chris chuckles softly] [birds chirping] [Josh] I came as soon as I could. [Bolt] We've been driving all day. He was really anxious - to see you. You... - [Josh] Oh... Wait, who are you? Me? I'm Bolt. I'm his manager. - Yeah, get a new job. - [Bolt] And I'm his friend. - [Josh] To us. - [echoes] To us. [wind howling] [mic feedback] Six years I haven't seen this guy. It's exactly why we'd all left him. It's like time never happened. Josh, he needs our help! Look at him! What do you mean "look at him"? You look at him. You seen him? She has been. She gave me a cold compress, made us tea. [Josh] Look, he needs to get to a hospital, okay? That's what he needs. - Trust me. - No, no. Please, please, don't, um... Yeah, yeah, he, he broke out of rehab, and if you do that, they'll just send him to jail. He drove all this way to see you. - [Bolt] Technically, I drove. - [Chris] Thank you. Look, we can put him up in the guest bedroom. It's not a big deal. It's the least he deserves. What do you mean, what he deserves? I don't owe him anything. I remember you two were inseparable in high school. - You might not remember me, but I remember you two. - Honey, don't do this. No, I remember every time you got into one of your fights, he was there. Skinny punk who could barely throw a punch, but he was there beside you getting his ass kicked every time. And every time he hurt himself, you were by his side, too. Think the whole school didn't know that he was sleeping in your basement because he couldn't go back home? For God's sakes, you to run away together. What's wrong with you? It's Ian! [Chris] He's shaky. Please. You, you help me get him upstairs. Come on, man. [Josh grunts] [rock music] [Ian] Best Kept Secrets. Someone? Anyone! Best Kept Secret. Come see us tonight. Best Kept Secret, people. Come on. - Hey! Best Kept Secret. - [woman] Thanks. Best band on Sunset, under the sun. Anyone? Man, I'm not getting any luck on this side of the street. Maybe it's your hair, man. Your mom didn't mind. - Best Kept Secret. - Best Kept Secret. Come on. Best... Hey. Best Kept Secret. - Oh. - Yeah, we're the new band in town. - Okay, cool. - This is really interesting. - Definitely catch up. - Yeah, think I'll give you two. - All right. - Give it to your friends. Hey, Best Kept Secret. Best Kept Secret, best band under the sun on Sunset. Man, none of these people are gonna come see us. Bro, I really need you to stop worrying about what's going to happen, okay? Doesn't it bother you that no one cares, no one sees us? We have no money, no real gigs. We have nowhere to stay. Hey, Best Kept Secret, tonight in Hollywood. Hello! Are you all gonna come see our show? - [Ian] How are you pulling this off, man? - Yo, my friend here thinks none of you are gonna come see our show tonight. Are you gonna come see our show? See? This is what I'm telling you, man. Bro, you got to practice equanimity. You don't even know what "equanimity" means. It's like love and shit. Oh, dude, you're a hippie. Get out of here! Are you fucking bumming me out? Hey, girl. [Skate] You've got to stop doubting yourself, man. You're gonna miss your own show. Speaking of show, you know where Josh is? - Best Kept Secret. - I don't know, man. [Ian] I tried calling him earlier, he didn't answer. Come on, great show. Bro, I don't know what you want me to say, man. I don't know where he's at. [Ian] You know, you're not a very good liar, Skate. [inaudible] [rock music] [gasps] [birds chirping] What the fuck? [rock music] [drums solo] [music stops] [arguing indistinctly] [guitar music] [Josh] Hey! Hey. You can't smoke in here. I'm... Look, I'm sorry, man. I... What the fuck you doing, man? Come on. It's okay. [chuckles softly] Josh gets lost in his thoughts too. What? He gets lost in his thoughts too. - Please have a seat. - Who does? Josh does. - [Ian] He does? - Yeah, he does. In the morning sometimes, he lays there and stare into space like he's trying to solve one of the great questions of life. [whispers] He doesn't know that I know. I'm sorry, I'm afraid I haven't had the pleasure of meeting you. - Oh. - It's my wife, Ian. Tell me, why haven't I met your hypnotizingly beautiful wife before? - [laughs] Oh, my God. No. - [Josh] You have. Were you too whacked out? - I'm, I'm sorry I was... - It's okay. [Josh] Baby. Yeah. Can you, uh... Can you go fix up some food or something? - Yeah, sure. - [Josh] Yeah? Good talking to you. Aren't you supposed to be in rehab? How do you know that, man? How do I know that? Everyone knows that, man. I mean, your latest stunt is all TMZ can talk about. "Where is Ian Ford?" "Has Ian Ford gone too far?" Fuck rehab, man! That fucking place. They don't know what the fuck they're doing. Okay? - You know what I mean? - [Josh] No. No, I don't know what you mean, Ian. That's why it's called rehab, and that's why you were there. And that's why you're supposed to be there, because you don't know what the fuck you're doing! Okay? You know what I mean? I didn't want to be there. - So I bounced. - Of course you didn't. They're trying to feed me with bullshit. That, that I need to be fixed, that I need to become a better version of myself. It's been what... four years? Six years. I left LA six years ago. Really? Six years, huh? Fuck. [Josh] Why are you here? I send you checks, you get 'em? Yeah, I get 'em. I mean, I don't cash them. - You don't cash them? - No, I don't fucking cash 'em. I just said that. - Why? - [scoffs] I-It's half, you know. What, you think you can just buy my forgiveness? You just send some checks? You think that makes me think you care, that you're a good person? Because you're doing something that "a good person would do." No, fuck that! Maybe it's not enough. Sure. You know what? And maybe everything I touch breaks. O-Okay. Shine a spotlight on my soul. Plead me guilty, whatever. But... But don't think that I don't care. Okay? Do me that one fucking solid. Why the fuck did you come here? Come on, let's, let's, let's not pretend that you sending me checks that you don't even know are cashed or not is your way of communicating and staying in touch. Because I, I don't buy it, man. And I know you don't fucking buy it. So for once in your fucking life, just give me a straight answer, man. I never meant for it to go down like that. [Josh] Shut the fuck up. You remember when we were kids... and, and we stole that guitar? We just saw that poor kid walking down the street, and we thought... We thought "Fuck it. Let's take that thing." And you and me, we threw a few punches for fun, and once we had it, we had no idea what to do with it. Fuck. Do you remember that? Yeah. That's a long fucking time ago, man. [Ian] We stayed up all night... just... walking around with it. We had no idea what we were doing, but, but we were hooked. Couldn't stop. [chuckles softly] And then, the next day we had to give it back because that kid's mom came knocking. I remember, uh, your dad, he wanted to hang us by our necks. What was that kid's name? I don't remember. I still remember that guitar, though. It was a piece of crap. What happened, man? How did everything get so fucked? How did it get so fucked? You know how it got so fucked? Because you're the one who fucked it up! [rock music] [drums solo] [rock music on stereo] It's fucking real, dudes. [Ian] It's just like in the pictures, man. - Right? - No, you ain't seen nothing yet, bro. [rock music continues on stereo] Fucking made it! We made it! Shouldn't we go in, dudes? - Yeah. - Fuck, yeah! - Let's go! - Yeah. [chuckles] Holy shit. [guitar music] [chuckles softly] You're still here? [Skate] It's so serene. [chuckles softly] Fucking girl losers, we can stay as long as we like. - Are you sure, man? - [Josh] Come on, man. Stop being such a fucking pussy. Four weeks ago, we were sitting at home and we were talking about how fucking sick and tired we were of that shitty hole. Okay? And what did I tell you, huh? What did I fucking tell you? You said we either gonna... We're either gonna get out now or stay here forever. So let's stop being pussies and get the fuck out! That's what I fucking said, man! We're fucking here! Look out that window. Look out the fucking window, boys! What do you see? Look at that sky, man! Holy fucking shit. [Skate] Opportunities. [Josh] Look at that. Look at opportunity. Dude, look at the fucking girls down there. Look, they're waiting for us to go talk to them. [Skate chuckles] Ah, dude... We made it. We fucking made it, man. To never going back. No, man. - To us. - Mm. - To Best Kept Secret. - [both] Best Kept Secret. - Best Kept Secret! - Best Kept Secret.

That Ian got more famous than the band, and so no one actually cared about the music anymore. Isn't that what you told me? You said you didn't know who we were anymore. I'm not an idiot, Josh [Josh] Look, Chris... I never lied to you. Keeping secrets from me is the same as lying. [exhales sharply] I'm your wife. Your wife. We've been married two years, and not once have I ever pried about your life in LA. Well, now I'm asking. What happened? [somber music] Look, when we... we first moved out to LA... we lived in this apartment on Sunset. That was... before we met the producer, before we lived in his place on the hill... before the band blew up... we... We, uh... We lived with this girl. What girl? Sarah. Her name was Sarah. [Ian laughing] Oh, my God. [laughing] Oh, my God. - [Sarah laughing] - Oh! [Josh] You all right? I told you not to drink so much, man. [Sarah] All right, he's fine. - [Ian] Oh, no, I can stand. - [Skate] You can't stand up. [Ian] I can stand. I can stand. - Oh, you know, I'm just gonna... - [Skate] Oh, fuck! - Oh, shit. - [all laughing] [Josh] Come on, man, I'll help you. [Skate] Come on, get up. [laughing] [Sarah] I know exactly what he needs. - [Josh] Some sleep? - [Sarah] You can sleep when you're dead. Little boys, welcome to the City of Angels.

Are you listening to what I'm saying? Listen to what I'm saying. - [Sarah] I'm listening. - You know... Music means... a soul. And... [Josh] Hey. [Sarah giggles] [Ian] You are straddling a great guy right there. [laughing] I think it's, uh, pretty obvious to everyone, bro. - Yeah, but that's not my point. - [Josh laughs] - My point is that... - What, he's a great guy? Yes, yes, but what I'm trying to say is, if, if you break his heart, - then... - Then what? You'll kill me? What, you'll walk me to the nearest tower and you'll drop me and you'll watch as gravity sends me to my death, and my guts just splatter all over the sidewalk? That's just morbid.

[Ian] Hey. [both grunting] [drums playing] [both panting] [Josh] Hey-oh, hey-oh! [Josh singing gibberish] [Sarah] Hey. Mm. How did you sleep? [Ian] As much as I don't mind the show, folks, my shit's kinda all fucked up right now. Allow a brother some peace. You're awake. I was meditating. Well, we've got that meeting with that record label guy in, like, two hours, okay? I think this is it. So... Come on. Let's not fuck this up. [Ian] You don't want to fuck it up? Oh, well, shit. You should have said something sooner. I'll get on that ASAP. [laughs] Uh, Sarah, dear... Afraid you did it all, babe. Oh, fuck me sideways. It's not good. [Josh] You did all of it? All of it? What? Oh, come on, don't give me that face, bro. All of the '80s rockers... needed blow. They, they did a lot worse than blow, too. If you and me want to become legends, my friend, you must party like the legends. You and me are amateurs. The first degree. [empty can rattles] - [laughs] - [Ian] Here we go. - [Sarah] No way. - [Ian laugh mischievously] [Sarah laughs] [Ian] Don't you wanna be a legend? I wanna be a legend. Come on. Come join me in the deep end. [Sarah chuckles] [snorts] [Ian] Oh! [grunts] [laughs] Who's Sarah? [Sarah laughs] Uh, Sarah, she, I don't... What do you mean? She was... [sighs] She was close with the band. She was... Glorified groupie, it's probably the best way to describe Sarah. Glorified groupie? She was your girlfriend? [sighs] Chris, would you... Look, when you're in a rock band, you don't really have labels on girlfriend and boyfriend, okay? It was just how it was. Well, yes. If you want to say that, yes, she was my girlfriend. You know about all my other ex-boyfriends. You never told me about Sarah. Because it doesn't fucking matter, that's why. To be honest, I don't give a fuck about your ex-boyfriends, okay? It doesn't matter. What matters is us now. It matters because she was part of your life and you and Ian... [Josh] Emphasis on the "was part" of my life. Why is Ian here? I have no fucking idea why he's here. You have as much information as I do. I don't know why he turned up. I haven't seen the fucking guy in six years. [Chris] You don't tell me anything. I'm in the dark. And he just suddenly shows up on my doorstep... What do you mean don't tell you anything? - I tell you everything. - Who is Sarah? I didn't even know anything about Ian. [exhales sharply] You don't want to know anything about Ian. He's not a good person. And I don't wanna tell you because I wanna protect you from that. Keeping secrets from me is not protecting me. You know I was in a band. Okay? - You never answered my question. - That's no secret. What kind of stuff did you guys do? Jesus Christ. - I want to know. - We played music. Don't be a smart-ass. Okay. We did everything a normal band does. Okay, you want to know? I'll fucking tell you. We drank, we partied. We fucked girls. We did drugs, we did everything. But it doesn't matter. I was fucking 19, Chris. - Come on. - Get your hands off me. Look, I'm not... I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. - Baby, baby, baby, come here. - Stop. Baby, I didn't mean this. [Chris breathing heavily] [sighs] Chris, it was, it was in the past. It was my old life. I was fucking what, 19? Does it matter, Chris? I mean... Come on. I started a new life with you. That's, that's what fucking matters. Why did you come back? Jesus Christ. You knew I was in a band. What the fuck did you think was happening, huh? I don't know, Josh, up until five minutes ago, you never told me you've done cocaine! Or that Ian was spiraling out of control, that you're even a part of it. Chris, please, just, just come sit next to me, please. - Let's talk. Just talk this... - [Chris] You haven't even told me anything! Just talk to me, please. How long did you live with her? - Why, why does it matter how... - [Chris] I want to know how long did you fucking live with her? I, I don't remember, it... I don't remember, Chris. It was, it was... I don't know, two years on and off maybe. Two years? [Chris sniffles] [Chris crying] I'm gonna... [sniffles] I'm gonna make dinner for you and... your best friend and his... whatever. And when I'm done... we're gonna sit down and you will tell me all of it. All of it. [door opens] [door closes] You gotta tell him, Ian. What if he's tripping? Yeah. Uh, I know. So go do it. Yeah. Yeah. [Sarah] Oh, my goodness. - Come in. - [Sarah clears throat] [both chuckle] - This way. - I just walk? [Ian] Mm-hmm. [Ian whispers] This way. - [Ian] Oh, oh. Oh... - [Sarah chuckles] - What was that? - [Ian] Sit down. [both chuckle] Wait, can I take this thing off now? No, no, no, no, no. Ah, it's been on my face for like, half an hour. It's meant to be a surprise. Okay, but I don't want to keep it on much longer. Okay. Okay. The best thought. Mm. [chuckles] - Okay, okay, I'm taking it off now. [sighs] [clears throat] Ian, what the fuck is this place? I think the better question is, "What's inside this box?" Ian... Uh, I mean... [Sarah chuckles] - Keys? - [Ian] Yeah. One for you, one for me. To this place. I bought it. [Sarah chuckles] Can you afford this? Who cares? It's our home, babe. Yeah. [chuckles] [both chuckle] [Sarah sighs deeply] No? You don't like it. Ah, fuck. You don't like it. - I mean, it's just... - I knew it. I knew it. You hate it. [Sarah] It's... [Ian] I should have asked you first. [Sarah] ...big, I guess. [snorts and coughs] [Sarah] Hey, hey. Shut up. I love it, okay? - You do? - Yeah, I do. - For real? - For real. Where's my fucking shit? Where have you put it? Where have you fucking put it? - [crying] - Goddammit, Sarah! Stop! Get the fuck away from me! - No. - Get the... Give it back! - You... this is what you want? - [Sarah crying] - [sobbing] - [Ian] Goddamn it, Sarah! Stop! Stop this! Stop this insanity! You want insanity? I can give you insanity. You'd have to be here to take it, but... I can give you insanity. [Ian] Stop. Stop this. [Sarah] What do you want me to stop? Waiting for you? Fucking waiting for you? I've been waiting for you every fucking day! Fucking... [Ian] You know what? If you're so tired of sitting there... - then leave. - [glass clinking] Get out. There's the door. Huh? There are no bars, no chains, no fucking locks that you don't have the fucking keys to, huh? You're so bored, get up and leave! Every day, I'm working! - Killing myself for you! - Right. For us! And what, what are you doing? - Sitting there, turning your veins black! - Get off me! Putting spots on your liver, holes in your nose! I'm disgusted! [sobbing] You wouldn't have any of this if it wasn't for me. None of it. No music. You wouldn't have your fucking big stage. None of it. None of it. And then you tell me to fucking leave? Right. Big move, babe. Big move. Big fucking move. Where's my shit? Where did you put my shit? Fuck. [crying] - Sarah... - [sobbing] I'm nothing! Sarah... [upbeat orchestral music] [Ian burps] [Chris] All right. So, Chris, aside from your amazing domestic skills, um, what are you into? Uh... I'm a respiratory therapist. - Oh, awesome. - Mm-hmm. I learned CPR when I was a junior lifeguard. [Josh] Good for you. What? Can you not fathom someone being interested in my boring career? I'm very interested in your career. What, what exactly does a respiratory therapist do? I, uh, think it's like Kundalini yoga or something. I don't know. I, uh... I love yoga. [Chris and Ian chuckle] That's great. [Ian chuckles] [Bolt] Can we do yoga sometime? [gagging] [chuckles softly] Sorry, just... I have never had chicken this good. [chuckles softly] Cheers, guys. [Ian] Ha-ha. [door opens] Baby. Don't "baby" me. So she slept with him? What? [sighs] Why don't we just... No. Stop. That's why you left LA. Because she cheated on you with your best friend. I don't get it. So you're mad because I left LA and met you again? Come on, that's ridiculous. No, you're ridiculous. What was I to you then? A rebound, a distraction? You asked me to marry you, and I said, yes. But you were never able to tell me that you left LA because someone you loved broke your heart. Because it was in the past, Chris. It was years ago, okay? Why does it matter why I left LA? It matters because there was someone in your past that you loved more than anything else in the world. - Probably more than me. - Come on. You never told me. Don't act like you don't understand, because I figured it out. Why you left your music career behind. Why you left your band behind and why you left Ian behind. Why you left your whole life behind. Not because he got more famous than you, because that would actually help your band, but it was because some slut Sarah slept with your best friend behind your back! Don't... Don't call her a slut. [Chris scoffs] What? Thank you, Ian, for coming and bringing the truth with you because this coward was never going to. So is that slut... going to be my next surprise visitor? I said don't call her a slut! We were never happy like you two were. I can still remember you guys' faces when you were together. You guys were happy in a way that I never was, in a way that me and Sarah never were. [Josh] Get to the point, Ian. [crying] As time went on... she got... darker, heavier. It wasn't just the blow anymore! I would come home... from being on tour for days, sometimes weeks... and she wouldn't be there. And I would sit and I would wait for her. And sometimes she came home and sometimes she didn't. And I would leave as if everything was okay. I can still picture her laying on that floor every single day. I got home... they were both gone. Who? - I was on tour. - [shouts] Who? [Ian] It wasn't my fault. She was fucking pregnant, Josh. She was fucking pregnant and she was shooting dope! I was on tour. I didn't know! I came home, to the house... I'm so fucking sorry. What are you saying? I'm so fucking sorry, Josh. - What the fuck are you saying? - I'm sorry! Fuck. She's dead, man. [both grunting] - [Chris] Stop! - Go away! [Josh grunts] [both grunting] You said you'd protect her! [grunting] [both grunting] [Ian] I'm sorry, man. [grunts] - [gagging] - [Josh panting] [gagging] - [Josh crying] - [coughing] [panting] You said she was your hourglass. You told me you had no guide without her. The glass broke, man. The glass fucking broke. [both panting] [somber rock music] [wind blowing] You take care of yourself now, yeah?
