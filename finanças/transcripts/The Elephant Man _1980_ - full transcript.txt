- Get rid of her, I want to see them! - Darling, don't be difficult! Let's take our sweet, lovely children on an outing! You can't do this. I know my rights. I have the authority to close you down. This exhibit degrades everybody who sees it and as well as the poor creature himself. He is a freak. How else will he live? Freaks are on thing, there's no objection to freaks, but this is entirely different! This is montrous and should not be allowed! These officers will see to it that you are on your way as soon as possible. Good day! Move along please! Hold it there, sir. Come this way. On the move again... My treasure. We're seeing a lot more of these machine accidents, Mr. Hodges. Abominable things these machines. You can't reason with them. What a mess. Pull on the rope! Irons, please. Who is it? Excuse me, sir. - Yes, what is it? I found it. - Good. Did you see it? No. - Alright then. I'll see you in a moment. Thank you. Who's that? - A friend of mine. Oh yes? What are you up to, Treves? - Nothing. Oh, come on, Freddy! Nothing of any importance. Excuse me, do you know where Green Street is? Second on the left, then right. - Thanks. Are you the proprietor? - And who might you be, sir? Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it. I don't think so, no sir, we're... closed! - Now, I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor? - Handsomely? Who sent you? I beg your pardon? - Never mind. I'm the... owner. Life... is full of surprises. Consider the fate of this creature's poor mother, struck down... in the fourth month of her maternal condition by an elephant, a wild elephant. Struck down... on an uncharted African isle. The result... is plain to see. Ladies and Gentlemen, the terrible... Elephant Man! - Stand up! - Stand up! - Turn around! - Turn around! Yes, um, you'll bring him to me tomorrow morning at Ten, Mr....? Bytes. He'll be there. Now here's my card and I'll send a cab, all right? We have a deal. We understand each other, more than money has changed hands. We understand each other completely, my friend. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Bytes. Cor, what a stink! I'm looking for Mr. Frederick Treves. Please, ma'am. Well, I'll send for him. Nurse! Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this, um... Yes. - Says, that... Yes, I was expecting him. So, you are the cab driver? - Yes, sir. - Anyone else with you? No, sir, just this gentleman. - Thank you for your troubles. Not at all. My pleasure. - Thank you. Will you come this way, please? Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my room and I'm not to be disturbed, all right? Of course, sir. Will you come with me, please? You heard what the doctor said? Go on! My name is Frederick Treves and I'm the surgeon here at the London Hospital. And, um... I lecture in anatomy at the, um, medical college. Sorry. I'd like very much, uh, to examine you, so that um.. I mean would that be all right? Please. First, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Would that be alright? Now your owner tells me, I mean the man who looks after you, tells me that, uh.. you're English and that your name is John Merrick. John Merrick, is that right? I tell you what, I think I'll ask you a question and you shake your head like this for, uh, 'no'. Have you always been the way you are now? Are you in any pain? Are your parents still alive? Do you understand me? Your father, your mother, are they dead? Freddie, what are you doing...? Oh, I'm teribbly sorry. I had no idea... Fred, what the hell do you got in there? - You'll know soon enough at the meeting of the society. Until then, I beg of you, not a word to anyone. Alright, if you insist but you must have quite a find in there. I don't know what I've got. - "Nothing of any importance", eh? Not a word, please, Fox. Alright. I think I'll examine you now. I'll leave the questions till later. Will you take your hat off for me, please? Don't be frightened. I simply want to look at you. Take your hat off. Don't be frightened. Thank you. Good afternoon. Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers! Pull the curtains aside! He is English. He is 21 years of age. His name is John Merrick. Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon many deformities of the face due to injury or disease as well as mutilations and contortions of the body depending from like causes. But in no time have I met with such a perverted or degraded version of a human being as this man. I wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. Can you see over there? Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull right upper limb, which is totally useless, the alarming curvature of the spine. Would you turn around, please? Turn around, please! The looseness of the skin and the varied fibrous tumours that cover 90% of the body. And there is every indication that these afflictions have been inexistence and have progressed rapidly since birth. The patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. As an interesting side note: In despite of the aforementioned anomalies the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected. Thank you. And his left arm is perfectly normal, as you see. So gentlemen, owing to the serious conditions, the congenital extostoses of the skull, extensive papillomatous growths, large pendulous masses in connection with the skin, the great enlargement of the right upper limb involving all the bones, the massive distortion of the head and the extensive area covered by papillomatous growth, The patient has been called the "The Elephant Man". Thank you. You haven't mentioned his mental state. Oh he's an imbecile, probably from birth. Man's a complete idiot. Pray to God he's an idiot. Where have you been? Out! How can I eat with a noise like that? Bytes, don't! Where've you been? What did you do? Our man is sick. Come right away! - What is it? Like this... What did you do with him? He's been like this all night! He was fine when he left here. Now look at him! Yes, I intend to. What happened? - He fell. He falls. Looks like he's had a very severe fall. He's a... ... clumsy soul. Never looks where he's going. But that's alright. He has me to take care of him. Why is he sitting up like this!? He needs rest! Well, that's how he sleeps. If he lies down, he'll kill himself. His head's too big. This man belongs in the hospital. Can't you treat him here? Listen, he's my livelihood. We're business partners, he and l. He's the greatest freak in the world! - Yes, now, you listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihoodif he dies. Now stop wasting my time, I'm going to fetch a cab! I, uh, I-I truly-truly appreciate this, my friend. Listen, there a lot a things I can do for you. You see, I move in the proper circles for... this type of thing. In fact, anything at all, if you take my meaning. Everything will be taken care of. - It's good to do business with you. Can I have a bowl of oatmeal, please? Breakfasting with the patients this morning, Mr. Treves? - Yes, no, It's for a patient. There you are. Thank you. Good morning. - Morning. Just come here for a moment, will you? What's that you've got there? Good Heavens! You haven't acquired a sudden taste for this sort of stuff? Yes, it's quite nutricious. - Possibly. Not quite the diet for a grown man. Nurse! When you have a moment, just take this up to the patient in the isolation ward, will you? Yes, sir. Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you. Won't he indeed. Now just a minute, Treves! There's something I want to say to you. Come in. A hospital's no place for secrecy, you know, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about the corridors is apt to cause comment. Why wasn't the patient properly admitted? Why is he in the isolation ward? He's not contagious, is he? - Oh no, sir. No, he's got chronic bronchitis, and he's been badly beaten. - Why isn't he in the General Ward then? Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed and um.. I fear the other patients would find him rather shocking. Deformed, is that it? Am I to assume then, that he is ultimately incurable? Yes, sir. - But you must be aware, Mr. Treves, that this hospital doesn't accept incurables. The rules are perfectly clear on that point. Yes, sir. I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite, quite exceptional. Yes, I quite appreciate your problem, Mr. Treves. Why not contact the British Home or the Royal Hospital for lncurables? Perhaps they might find a place for him. - Yes, sir, I'll look into it. Would you like to meet him? Excuse me! The Elephant Man. Sorry. Sorry. I should have warned you. Please forgive me. You alright? Please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up here. Tell her to knock on the door and wait for me. I'm sorry about that, I, uh.. We'll bring you another breakfast. I'm sure you must be very hungry. I think you'll be quite comfortable here for a while. I'll see to it you'll have everything you need. Blimey! So, this is the Elephant Man. I ain't seen nothing like you before. What the bleedin' happened to ya? Dumb, eh? I like people that can keep quiet. Here, have a drink! Go on! No? You should be more sociable, mate. Get yourself disliked. You and I are going to be good friends and I've got a lot of friends who like to meet you. And they will, mate, believe me. They will. I've brought your breakfast. What are you doing down there? Come on, up on the bed. Come on! Up on the bed. - All he understands is a good smack. - He's had his share of smacks. You see, that's what drives him under the bed. You have to treat him with kindness and patience. Well, perhaps you've got time for that sort of... treatment, Mr. Treves. But I've got a hospital to run. Now, don't you waste your time with him, sir. It's like talking to a brick wall. I don't mean to be harsh but he doesn't belong here. Now, honestly, sir. Honestly, what can you do for him? Oh, by the way, Mr. Carr Gomm said he would like to see you when you, uh, can spare a moment. Yes. - Right. I can't help you, unless you help me. See, I believe there's something you want to say to me. Something back there. I can't help you, unless you help me, you know! I believe you want to say something to me, don't you? I've got to understand what you're feeling and understand what you're thinking. Do you understand me? All right, just nod your head if you can und- Can you understand me? Just- Just nod your head if you understand me. Alright. You do understand. Now, I want to hear, I want to hear you talk. We're gonna- We're gonna to show them that you are not a wall. Do you understand? I want you to talk to me. All right, now, I want to hear you say it. I've got to hear how you say things. I'm not going to hurt you. I've got understand how you say things. I've got to hear them! Very slowly, I want you to say "yes". Say "yes". Yes. Yes! Good. All right. Now just once more: "yes". Yes, I can understand that. That's good! That's very good. Alright now I'm going to say some words to you and I want you repeat them. Do you understand? Say "Hello, my name is..." Hello. My name is... John Merrick. John Merrick. John, that's very good. Say "John Merrick" Merrick. "Hello, my name is John Merrick" Hello, my name is... ... is John Merrick. You can speak! How did you get up here? - I want my man back. - Just a moment, how did you get- Never mind. I want my man. He's still very sick. Now, please, come downstairs with me and I'll explain the situation. Don't! Don't. You've had plenty of time to... cure him. And now he's leaving with me. Do you understand me? Now! Mr. Treves. - We made a deal. - You misunderstood. This man has suffered a severe fall. If you take my meaning. - Now he's my patient now. - Pull the other one, why don't you? Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry but all you do is profit from another man's misery. - Do you think you are better than me? - No. You wanted the freak to show to those doctor chums of yours, to make a name for yourself. You, my friend... I gave you the freak... on trust. In the name of science. And now I want him back! - You do not own this man. Now stop it! I want him back! - So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you. - I shall go to the authorities. - Go to the authorities, then! Go to them by all means. I'm sure they'll be very intereted to hear your story as well as ours. Now, I think we really do understand one another. Alright. Alright. A singularly unattractive character, I must say! Well, Treves, it seems to me I might as well meet this patient of yours. Thank you very much. Thank you. Shall we say in a few days then? Shall we say Two o'clock tomorrow afternoon? Yes, well, whatever's most convenient for you, sir. Two o'clock then, tomorrow. Thank you very much. Two o'clock... Morning, Mr Treves. Early again I see! - Yes. With these early habits of yours, you might've been a good milkman! I'll keep that in mind, Charles. - Okay, sir. "He restoreth my soul. "He leadeth me into paths of... righteousness for his name's sake." "Righteousness!" "He leadeth me into the paths of righteousness for his name's sake." Good. It's very good. Good, when your visitor comes today, I want you to say exactly the way you've said it just now. So, when I introduce him to you, just say the words you've learned. If you have trouble with any of the words, I'll help you, so there's nothing to worry about. I'll introduce you to him and say: "Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm." And will you say: Hello, my name is John Merrick. I'm very pleased to meet you. Good. Good. I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm. It is only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. - But he can talk. - Well, talking is one thing, Treves, but is he able to understand what's said to him? Yes. Oh, yes. Except, um.. Except he's so anxious to make a good impression on you, that he might seem a little nervous. Come in! May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm? Mr. Carr Gomm, - This is John Merrick. - Hello. My name is John Merrick. I'm very pleased to meet you. I'm very pleased to meet you. - How are you feeling today? - I feel much better. Are you comfortable here? Everybody's been very kind. How is your bronchitis? Mr. Merrick likes the food here, don't you? - Much better than what I'm used to. - Oh yes? Yes, and what was that? Potatoes. I understoond that you've been flogged? I feel much better now. That's splendid. How do you find Mr. Treves as a teacher, I mean? Very kind. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview? Very kind. Yes, of course, I understand. Well, It's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day to you. Very good, John. It was very good. I'll be back in a moment. "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me lie down..." Well, it was a brave attempt, Treves, but the man was obviously, just simply mouthing words taught by you. Yes, well, I'm sorry to have wasted your time. "He retoreth my soul." He simply doesn't belong here. He'd be much better off somewhere else, so he can be constantly looked after. I'm sorry, Treves, things have turned out this way. Good day to you. "Yes Though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff..." Mr. Carr Gomm! Yes, what is it? It's that! I didn't teach him that part! "Goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever." - How did you know the rest of it? I didn't teach you the rest of it. - It's very strange. I mean, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm? I used to read the Bible every day. I know it very well and the Book of Common Prayer. The 23rd Psalm's beautiful. It's my favourite. Treves, come and see me in my office when you're through up here. There's something important I want to say to you. Goodbye, Mr. Merrick. I do hope we shall meet again. Why didn't you tell me you can read? I was frightened. - I see. - I was afraid to talk. Please forgive me. - Can you imagine the kind of life he must have had? - Yes, I think I can. I don't believe so. No one could possibly imagine it, I don't believe any of us can. Terrible though his appearance is, so terrible indeed, that women and nervous persons fly in horror from the sight of him, and that he is debarred from seeking to earn his livelihood in any ordinary way. Yet he is superior in intelligence. He can read and write, is quiet, gentle, not to say even refined in his mine. I should very much like to meet this gentleman. Have you seen this? - No. Now, listen to this! - Hey up, hey up! Hey up! Now, listen! This is a letter to the London Times from the governor of the hospital. There is now in a little room in of our attic wards is a man named John Merrick, so dreadful a sight, that he is unable even to come out by daylight to the garden. He's been called the "Elephant Man" on account of his terrible deformity. His appearance is so terrible, that women and nervous persons fly in terror at the sight of him. And how do you get tickets to see him? Your very own Sunny Jim! - Let's go and see him! All right, keep your shirt on. The time must be right. Right now he's in the attic, but tomorrow they're gonna move him to Bedstead Square, right into my lap. Then, for the right price you will see something you'll never ever see again in your life! Well, don't look so glum, girls, enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful! Put your collar straight, girl! And remember that under no circumstances whatsoever are any mirrors to be brought into this room. - Yes, Mrs. Mothershead. Yes, Mrs. Mothershead. - Yes. Right. He's so ugly! - Yeah, well, ugly or not, you're gonna help me! Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick? Yes. You look very nice in your new clothes. Thank you very much. - Yeah, well, if there's nothing else, I suppose we'll be leaving you now. - No, there's nothing. You ready for tea? Please go in, John. Make yourself comfortable. Anne, come and meet our guest. Mr. Merrick, I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne. Anne, this is John Merrick. I'm very pleased to meet you. I... I'm very pleased. What is it? What's the matter? It's just that I... I'm not used to being treated so well by so beautiful a woman. Would you like a cup of tea, Mr. Merrick? - That's a good idea. Would you like to come and see rest of the house? Come on, I'll show you. How's your tea? Very good. I'm enjoying my visit here very much. It's so kind of you to invite me to your home. I'm sorry that I made a spectacle of myself. No, not at all. I love the way you- you've arranged the pictures. - Oh, thank you. Is that the way they do it in most houses? Yes, I'm sure they do, yes. Who are they of? These are relatives and these are our children. Children? Oh, may I see? Yes, of course. Where are the children? Well, they're out with friends. Friends... And here is Frederick's mother. And these are my parents. They have such noble faces. Yes, I've always thought so myself. Would you... care to see my mother? Your mother? Yes, please. Oh, but she's... Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful! She has... She has the face of an angel. I must... I must have been a great disappointment to her. No, Mr. Merrick, no. No son as loving as you could ever be a disappointment. If only I could find her! If she could see me with such lovely friends, perhaps she could love me as I am. I've tried so hard to be good. I'm so sorry. Sorry. - Please! I'm so sorry. Please! What's that you're doing? What is it? Oh, I see! St. Philip's! Why, it's very good! You've got the windows just right! I wish I could sleep like normal people. Mr. Treves, there's something I've been meaning to ask you for some time now. - What's that? Can you cure me? No. No. We can care for you, but we can't cure you. No. I thought not. Come in. Good morning! Good morning. - There's someone here would like to meet you if that's all right? May I introduce you to one of the bright lights of the English stage? Mrs. Kendal, this is John Merrick. Good day, Mr. Merrick! - Good day. I've brought you some things. I hope you like them. I hope you don't think it too forward? - Oh, no. I knew you'd understand. - I'll leave you together. Here. I want you to know I don't give my pictures to just anyone. No, I wouldn't think of it. It's beautiful. You're so... I'll put it... in a place of honor. Next to my mother. She's very pretty, your mother. - Oh, yes. Oh, I see you're constructing a... church? No. It's a cathedral. Do you see? Only, I have to rely on my imagination, for what I can't actually see. Mr. Treves tells me that you're in the theatre. Do you live there? - Oh no, Mr. Merrick, I just work there. It must be wonderful to work there. Is it beautiful? - You've never been? I'm afraid not. Oh, Mr. Merrick, You must go! The theatre is the most beautiful place on earth! Of course I am a bit partial. The theatre is romance. Romance? Oh yes... Which reminds me, I've brought you something else! Oh, Thank you. - Have you read it? No, but I certainly shall. "Romeo and Juliet"! Yes, I've heard of this. "If I profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: Thy lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand, to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss." "Good Pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion show in this. For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch. And palm to palm's holy Palmer's kiss." "Oh then, dear Saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou lest faith turn to despair." "Saints do not move, though grant for prayer's sake." "Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged." And then it says: they kiss. "Then have my lips the sin that they have took." "Sin from my lips? O trespass, sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again." Oh, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all. No? No. You're Romeo. "Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront of fashion, was seen leaving "The London" the other afternoon. No, dear readers, the actress has not been taken ill, but rather said she was visiting a friend. And who was the lucky recipient of this attention? Quick inquiries proved it to be none other than Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man, with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar. After a chat of 3 quarters of a hour, Mrs Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick with an autographed portrait of herself." I saw it in his room. "Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature, Mr. Merrick has never been properly presented to London society. But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal goes, other inevitably follow, the question arises - will London society present itself to him?" This walking stick is so dashing! And much more elegant than my old one! More tea? I don't go out as often as I would like, because naturally some people do find my appearance disturbing. If you have a chill I could close the window. No, I'm fine, please... I mean, Thank you. Thank you. You see, people are frightened by what they don't understand. And it is hard to understand, even for me because my mother was so very beautiful! Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think you should have any more visitors today. And I have to lecture the college, so I'll be back this evening! - Excuse me, sir, I would like a word with you. - I'm not late, what is it? Well, sir, I don't quite understand why did you allow that sort of people in there? Why? Because he enjoys it and I think it's good for him. Yes, but, sir, you saw the expression on their faces, they didn't hide their disgust! They don't care anything about John. They only want to impress their friends. I think you're being rather harsh on them, don't you Mrs. Mothershead? - I beg your pardon, sir. You, yourself, hardly showed him much loving kindness when he first arrived, did you? I bathed him, I fed him and I cleaned up after him, didn't I?! And I see that my nurses do the same. And if "loving kindness" can be called care and practical concern then I did show him loving kindness and I am not ashame to admit it! I didn't mean it exactly that way, Mrs. Mothershead. Now, please believe me.. Of course, I appreciate your concern. I appreciate everything that you've done for Mr. Merrick. - Thank you. But I am the physician in charge and I must do what I think is best for him. Please now, I'm, also, very late. - If you ask my opinion, he's only being stared at all over again! - Thank you. Night time! Freddie! What's the matter, Freddie? I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes. - Why on earth would you think of him? Well, I'm beggining to believe that Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike. That's absurd! It seems that I- I've made Mr. Merrick into a curiosity all over again, doesn't it? only this time in a hospital rather than a carnival. My name is constantly in the papers and I'm always being praised to the skies. Patients are now expressly asking for my services. Of course they do because you are a very fine doctor. John Merrick is happier and more fulfilled now then he's ever been in his entirely life and it's completely due to you. What was it all for? Why did I do it? Freddie, what are you trying to say? Am I a good man or am I a bad man? Steady on, Treves. Steady on, my dear fellow. Come sit down, won't you? Gentlemen, I know we usually open these proceedings by reading the minutes. But on this occasion, in the interests of urgency I think we should first conclude the matter previously under discussion, the case of Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. One moment, Mr. Chairman! As far as I'm concerned, this creature has no business being here at all. I, for one am sick and tired of this competitive, freak-hunting by these overly-ambitious young doctors, trying to make names for themselves. To parade them about in front of a pathological society is one thing, Mr. Treves, but to waste this committee's valuable time with requests for shelter of these abominations of nature is quite another. You must be more careful! In the light of these facts, our course is clear: The question is not whether to accept this creature as a patient, the question is when will those rooms be vacated for the use by better qualified, more deserving cases? I move that this Elephant Man be removed from the premises immediately. We have a sacred duty to cure the sick not to care for circus animals! - Mr. Broadneck.. - That is my last word on the subject. Mr. Chairman, shall we vote? - I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your mind is quite unshakeable in this? Mr. Chairman, do you not have ears? I am unalterably opposed! My mind is made up on this. You shall not sway me. May we now vote, at long last? Yes, Broadneck. I think the time has come. Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness Alexandra, Princess of Wales. Good morning, gentlemen. I hope I'm not disturbing you. On the contrary ma'am, your presence here is always greatly appreciated. We were just taking a vote on Mr. Merrick. Her Royal Highness has shown greatest interest in Mr. Merrick's fate. Indeed I have, sir, as has the Queen. I have a brief communication from her Majesty, which she has requested that I read to you. "To the Governing Committee, London Hospital. I would very much like to commend you for the charitable face you have shown Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. It is laudable that you have provided one of England's most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbor, a home. For this immeasurable kindness, as well as the many other acts of mercy on behalf of the poor, of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed, I gratefully thank you. Signed, Victoria." I am sure I can count on you gentlemen to do the Christian thing. Thank you very much, ma'am. I'm sure we shall all try. Gentlemen, I wish to move that Mr. John Merrick be admitted to this hospital on a permanent basis provided the hospital receives a yearly sum equal to the cost of the occupation of one bed. All those in favor? Thank you, gentlemen. The motion is carried. Yes, come in! Good afternoon. Mr. Carr Gomm has something he wants to say to you. Mr. Merrick, I have very great pleasure in being able to welcome you officially to the London Hospital. This morning, the Governing Committee has unanimously voted that you should be provided with these rooms on a permanent basis. This is your home now. I'm so very very glad for you. - Welcome home, lad! This is... my home? - Yes. Please will you thank the Governing Committee for me? I will do my utmost to merit their kindness. This... is my home? Yes. And this is one of... Your dressing case! Oh, thank you! Thank you! Oh my friends, thank you! Thank you! My friends! Oh my friends! Oh my friends! Thank you! Who's next? - I say! What you again? - Well... These young ladies have never seen it. You're on, mate! OK, that's it for this performance! Jim, can I go tonite? - Sit down, Charlie! There's always tomorrow, don't worry. Room for one more? At the right price. There's room. All right, all right, keep the noise down! We don't want to frighten him, do we! My name is John Merrick. I'm very, very pleased to meet you. I think you are very beautiful! Curtain time! You look beautiful, darling! I wouldn't change a thing! You look like the Prince of Wales! Here, my friends! The Elephant Man! I told you it was horrible, just horrible. Perhaps the ladies would like a closer look? Yes, yes! - No, Jack, please! Right, in you go! He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he! Give the ladies' man a little kiss! Come on! Jack, leave off! Here, here, that's enough romance! Time for beddy-byes! All right, all right, keep the noise down! Keep it quiet! Hey, keep quiet. Now watch this! Okay, that's enough! Show's over! See you back at the Peacock! Get out of here! Here, come on. There you are. That's better, isn't it? I've done well tonight. Here, buy yourself a sweet! My treasure! John? John! Mr. Treves, I know what happened last night. Dear, God! Where is he? Where's Mr. Merrick? Where is he? Where's Mr. Merrick? I don't know what you mean, sir. - Don't lie to me! I know all about it, you were seen. You're involved with Bytes, aren't you? You're taken him! Where is he? Now, wait a minute! Taken him? I haven't taken him anywhere. I dunno no Bytes. We were just having a bit of fun. We never hurt him. Liar, bastard! He's gone! When I left him he was in bed, safe and sound! You're not listening to me! I told you, I dunno no Bytes! I've done nothing wrong! People pay money to see your monster, Mr. Treves! I collect it. You're the monster, you're the freak. Now get out! You're finished. Damn you! You don't frighten me! You or your bleedin' Elephant Man. I'm glad what I done. You can do nothing about it! Only Mothershead can sack me now! Done! There's something I'd like to tell you, Treves. You know I felt as deeply as you did about John. Well now he's disappeared, very likely to the continent. There's no question of your going after him, you're desperately needed here by your patients. You did everything in your power. Remember that, Treves. Everything in your power. Get a stool! Get up, you bastard! Look at all these beautiful animals! What a lot you have! That sly bastard! He's doing this to spite me! You're doing this to spite me and it's got to stop! Bytes, he's sick! - Let him die! But don't think I'm going to bury that... bag of flesh. No! And that's a fact. Bytes, stop! - I'm going to fetch that lump of fat! No! Bytes, please stop! We've decided, we're going to get you out of here. Alright? Luck, my friend! Luck! And who needs it more than we? Sir, why is your head so big? Why is your head so big? Why is your head so big? Tell me! Why is your head so big? No! I'm not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am a man. Out of the way, sir. Excuse me! Mr. Treves, sir, they've found him! I think they've found John! Keep still, girl! It was nice of Mrs. Kendal to give me this dress. It's beautiful! Does Mrs. Kendal know that John's dying? Yes. Yes, she knows. How do I look? Splendid! You will not look out of place. You look absolutely splendid! Splendid... Shall we go? Again, I can't tell you how sorry I am for what happened. You see, I had no idea, really. You mustn't blame yourself. Mr. Treves, don't worry about me. My friend, I am happy every hour of the day. My life is full, because I know that I am loved. I have gained myself. I could not say that, were it not for you. Well... you have done so much for me as well. Thank you. I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora and be back in a few minutes! Very good, my friend. My friend! Mrs. Kendal! Your Royal Highness, Ladies and Gentlemen! Tonight's performance was very special to me, because it was very special to someone else, a man who knows the theatre and who loves the theatre. And yet this is the very first time he's ever been here. I wish to dedicate, the whole company wishes to dedicate with all their hearts tonight's performance to Mr. John Merrick, my very dear friend. Stand, John, c'mon. I can't. - It's alright, stand up! I really did believe that the ogre would never get out of the dungeon. You really enjoyed yourself. Oh, it was wonderful! We really must go again some evening. Oh, I hope so. Yes, we will, we will. Good, I'm pleased. Well, um, I ought to go. Must get some sleep. Good night. Sleep well. And you too, my friend. So pleased you enjoyed yourself. Good night. Good night. It's finished! Never, never! Nothing will die. The stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats. Nothing will die.
