I think that all the life experiences that people have... I experience it all through climbing There are times... I just give up So, we can start now Can I do it? Yes, go on Wow! Turn, turn, turn so it doesn't stick It's easier if you turn it on the worktop? Yeah Enjoy! And to you This haircut is on point! I remember that It was fashionable Why don't you wear it like that now? Janja was already dancing here I was dancing here She was very active We really thought we should put her in some sports club... so that she would get tired during the day... so we could have some peace and quiet in the evening Twice per week dancing lessons And twice per week climbing lessons The climbing began to overlap with her dancing classes My wife asked her "Janja, now you have to decide what you are going to continue with" "Climbing or dancing?" "You need to decide" We bought second-hand climbing shoes for starters What about the belt? That too Go Janja! Even as a little girl, Janja was very strong... showing her incredible strength Before soccer on national TV... Janja is like superhero! Come on, you alright? Doesn't matter though No matter what, you know, all this shit... we'll just work through it Let’s go. Go! Go! Ever since I started climbing... my goal has been... to become the strongest climber in the world That's what I was seeking... and I still am I want to not only become strong as a climber, but also strong as a person I’ve found an incident described on a page here... where Miho was angry We found her cute because she is the youngest Even when she was angry, she was cute So we were looking at her and smiling, her sisters and I But Miho didn’t like it at all and was angry Even then, she didn’t like losing She never wanted to be defeated by her older sisters But of course, it was impossible to imagine how far I could go I only had this unfounded self-confidence that I would somehow be ok... that I would become strong I just believed that You're my sugar Yeah, look at you There you go, Brookie-poo The achievement, it's so big We are on the moon and back, and moon and back... and moon and back Can I climb here? Yeah Thank you Enjoy your day Same to you I'm sad This is stylish, don't you think? She never wants to see herself losing That state of mind... is what has allowed her to reach her current performance level In 2018 Boulder World Cup, she was the overall champion I think that was an important moment for her My own country is hosting the Olympic Games... so I am really looking forward to it Being from Tokyo, a climber Being in a position to aim for a medal there... is really a miracle I want to do it now I feel that I really want to use the energy... that's been building up inside me - Dear viewers of S/ - PARK! I’ve been selected for the Olympic Games As I have been until now... I will continue working hard I want to do great things for Japan Many people have been rooting for me I want to prove myself worthy of that I have a responsibility. I really do Because I’ve been chosen, I have to do it Keeping that in mind, I will practise diligently I realised after the announcement was over I realise now that I was at my wit’s end Look at this This cut was really bad yesterday, but look at it today Look how quickly I heal Really deep cuts, too We've been trying to learn how to fit a carpet ourselves... and I'm just tucking it all the way in on the edges... It's weirdly satisfying, but kind of frustrating at the same time I always drink carbonated water I go to the fridge and there isn't any But now, even such a small thing can make me feel irritated I just live as usual, but when something happens... suddenly everything seems impossible There are times I just give up But you have to survive It might sound like an exaggeration... but all kinds of pressure... I was suppressing inside Oh, my back's sore! They did the first epidural... Go, go, go Come on, come on. You can do it! Come on, hold it! Yeah, like this. Keep going, keep going! It's like I'm climbing stupidly Stupidly, yeah. Weirdly Yeah, well... Damn it! I knew it! You won't help yourself on purpose What the fuck? I'm moving away It's pointless to keep doing this because I keep moving away Yes, I can see What now? I can't Quiet! Look, can I just say one thing? You came here and said, "I can't", and you started getting nervous What if you just turned a little? That's what I couldn't do Could you at least try? No Without saying, “I can’t” So how the fuck am I supposed to turn my leg from this position? This is how How? The same way you just did But I can't Come on I'm exhausted Because you don't calm yourself down Because you don't just take a breath. Just that. Take a breath If you pull through it you can do it But you have to believe If you are not all in... even if you are Janja, it's not possible to win Hey, I think your phone fell on the floor When you sit down to watch her in the Olympics... how are you going to feel? How shall I put it? The bigger the scale of the event... the more tense I become She was not the kind of child... to show her emotions I think because she is competitive She would keep saying that she wanted to get stronger I think I can be proud of her strong mindset I feel tension In my training and in my everyday life, I feel it constantly But when it comes to the competition... because I am prepared to give it my all, the anxiety is gone Just you wait The person in the photo is Miho’s grandfather. Her Grandpa He was really looking forward to the Olympic Games, but... he died one month before the World Championships started He’s watching over her Miho too wanted to show [the Olympics] to him She said, "Let’s take him with us" But this morning she was saying... "Grandpa may be in the stadium already" Yes! I can already breathe a little easier Oh, I knew it! She slipped I knew that she would slip Oh damn Janja is anxious You lost your speech, didn’t you? Unbelievable She wasn't careful enough I can't relax No There's no going back Climbing is about to start, please... Do it! Amazing! Amazing! So happy Well done, well done There were many difficult times and moments... when I thought I would give up, when I felt disheartened What I realised by winning the medal... it really made me stronger The value of every day's experience on this journey... I think it’s greater than the value of the medal
