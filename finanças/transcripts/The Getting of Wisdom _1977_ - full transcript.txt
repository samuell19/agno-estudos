(dogs barking) - Laura! Laura! Laura! - [Girl] Laura? - Did you find her? - She'd have heard me all right. It's gonna be a scorcher. - Why do you have to go away, Wondrous Fair? - 'Cause I'm gonna be famous, and even famous people have to be educated, that's why. Do you wanna hear the end of the Prince Rudolfo story before I go or don't you? - Yes please. - Further and further into the dark forest rode the prince, until suddenly, pushing his way through the verdant fronds, he found himself in a beauteous sylvan glade. There was a wondrous fair maiden dressed in a white silken gown which bore the marks of travel. - She had mud on her? - Yes. No. Sounds better if it's clean. - Hadn't she been traveling then? - And then the prince, no, she hadn't! And then the prince-- - Well then how did she get into the middle of the forest? - She got there, stupid, because I said she was there. Do you wanna hear the end of the story before I go, or don't you? - Melbourne's such an awfully long way away. - [Woman] Laura. I want you. - I don't like it! - My dear it's exactly the right length and there's nothing the matter with the hat. - The dress is too short, and the hat should be plain! - Laura, I've been up practically all-- - It's too short! It's too short, it's too short! (shattering) - Laura. Laura, my dear. (dogs barking) (horse neighs) - Morning, Missus. - Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell. - [Mr. O'Donnell] So today's the big day, eh? - Yes. - And the little girl, young lady, is off to school, eh? - That's right. Sandwiches for on the train. You behave yourself now. - You're more beautiful than ever, darling. (laughing) I don't need no help with that trunk. Didn't you know I was-- - Do remember all I've told you, dearest. - Yes, Mother. (Mr. O'Donnell laughs) - Bye, Wondrous Fair. - You don't need to call me that anymore. It's childish. You take good care of Benjamin, you swear? - Is my finger wet, is my finger dry? God'll strike me dead if I tell a lie. - Come on, young thing. Stop your crying, you'll have us bogged and missing the train. - Mr. O'Donnell? Mr. O'Donnell? Mr. O'Donnell, if you could-- - Don't you fret, Missus. I'll put her on the train meself. You know what they say. The Lord, he looks after the widow and the orphan. Why if he don't, Patrick O'Donnell does! Come on, gee up there! - Bye, Laura. - Bye, Laura! - Bye, Wondrous Fair. - Bye! - Bye, Laura! Bye! - Goodbye. (laughing) - Bye Laura! ♪ In Dublin's fair city where the girls are so pretty ♪ ♪ I once set me eye on sweet Molly Malone ♪ ♪ She wheeled a wheelbarrow ♪ ♪ Through streets broad and narrow ♪ ♪ Crying cockles and mussels alive, alive-o ♪ (light classical music) (train chugging) (train whistle blowing) - What is this wretched child's name? - Miss Laura Tweedle Rambotham from Warrenega. - Seriously? Ah, how will we know her? Oh my God. I say, who trimmed your hat? - My mother. (laughs) - I suppose she didn't want you to get lost. - Very gay. Makes you looks like a big red double dahlia. - I like the color. I chose it myself. - Well, so long as it doesn't frighten the horses. (choral singing) - Come on now child, just lift the ledge up, up. Any hope of a cup of tea, Mary? - I'm sorry, Miss Snodgrass, but we're getting supper, and you know Cook. - Confound. (shushing) - This way, Miss. In here if you please, Miss. I shall tell the lady superintendent you've arrived. - Thank you. (footsteps echoing) - The Rambotham child? - Yes, and you must be Mrs. Gurley. How do you do? (clock chiming) I'm afraid the train was rather late arriving. - Follow me. You will learn and observe the school rules. - Ah, Mrs. Gurley. - The new child, Mr. Strachey, Miss Rambotham. - Ah yes indeed. Rather late. - Yes, I'm terribly sorry. - [Mrs. Gurley] Rule one. - How do you do, Mr. Strachey? - No young lady will run, talk, laugh-- - My, what a very large place you have here! - In a silly manner. - Indeed. - Rule two. Each young lady is to have a bible, but no other books in her room. Rule three, no boarder is allowed to spend more than nine pence a week on sweetmeats or one shilling on fruit. Rule eight, the time for letter writing is on Tuesday or Friday evening between the hours of 6:30 and eight. Envelopes are not to be sealed. Correspondence is to be restricted to near relatives. - Oh, there's my box, somebody must have brought it up. - [Mrs. Gurley] Send Lilith Gordon to me immediately! - Yes Mrs. Gurley. - Rule nine. Penny fine for each item of unmarked clothing sent to the wash. - Of course Mother marked all my-- - Rule 10, no eatables of any kind allowed in bedrooms. - Oh no. - This will be handed in to Miss Chapman. - Oh yes, of course. - Apparel here, underwear, pinafores. Dresses and boots in the corner cupboard. - Yes, thank you. I've got an apron like that. They're awfully pretty, aren't they? - Little girl, did your mother never teach you it is rude to point? Not to mention comment on a person's apparel, however remarkable. Lilith Gordon, slovenliness may be allowed in pigs, not in ladies. You will take a conduct mark. - Yes, Mrs. Gurley. I'm sorry, Mrs. Gurley. It won't happen again, Mrs. Gurley. (clock chiming) - You will also assist the girl to put away her things. And bring her to the dining hall. (chattering) (jeers) - Old brimstone beast! What are you staring at, goggle eyes? Scrummy! Mm! Mm! Mm! (door clicks) (whispering and laughing) - [Mrs. Gurley] Silence! - I'm Miss Chapman, the deputy. For the present you had better sit over there I think, yes. - Thank you. (laughing) - The eyes of all wait upon thee, oh Lord, and thou givest them their meat in due season. Let the peoples praise thee, oh Lord. Let all the peoples praise thee. The earth hath yielded her increase. God, even our own Lord, shall bless us. God shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him. - Amen. - Amen. (laughing and chattering) - [Girl] Golly, she looks like a parrot! - [Girl] This way to the parrots, they're but a penny the whole show. - [Girl] Don't believe it, look at her! (laughing) - What you say your name is, kid? - Go on, tell us. - Laura Tweedle Rambotham. (laughing) - It couldn't be! - Hold me, or I'll split myself. Oh, Laura Tweedle Ram's Bottom. - Rambotham. - Oh sorry, Laura Tweedledum Ram's Bum. (laughing) - Oh really, Maria. - I don't believe it, no one could have a name like that. - She has, I saw it on her box. You should see her hat. - What about this too marvelous dress? - [Girl] Look at the color. - [Girl] Whoever made it? - My mother. (laughing) - How many servants do you keep? - Where on earth do you come from? - Why didn't you start at beginning of term? - What's your father? - Dead. (laughing) - [Girl] Suppose he was alive once. - He was a doctor. - [Girl] What'd he die of? - Consumption. - [Girl] Rum doctor. Couldn't even cure himself. (laughing) - So Maria, what have you got here? - [Maria] The new kid. Ask her what her name is. - What's your name, what's your father? - What's yours? - Ooh! - Well! (laughing) - That's one for you Kate Horner. Not bad, Tweedledum. Or is it Tweedledee? (bell rings) - Oh bugger, I have to go. Come on Maria. (chattering) (piano exercises) (violin exercises) - Are you lost? - No. (chattering) George I, 1714, 1727. George II, 1727, 17-- - 60. George III, 1760 to 1820. George IV, 1820 to 1830. William IV, 1830 to 1837. Queen Victoria, 1837 until the present day. (snorts) Facts, not fantasies, I told her. She's the greatest little oddity we've ever had here. - Oh I don't know-- - Those damn clothes are fit for an Easter fair. Her mother, I hear, runs a scruffy post office somewhere out in the bush. - Mrs. Rambotham, quite correct, and works for a living. - But if she has worked for her daughter to have a good education-- (snorts) - I thought the board wanted to keep this college select. (piano music) - Maria Morell's off again. Here's a letter addressed to an aunt. Starts off, "Dear George," and asks him to meet her near the Scotch College fence. - Incorrigible. She'll be married before she's turned 17. - Poor little thing. God, another trashy romance. Held In Bondage. How can you cry over such muck? - Because, thank heavens, I don't have a cold, hard heart like you. - You'll count the washing all wrong again tomorrow, your head'll be so full of that stuff. - What a life. I'd marry the first man who asked me, if he had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana skin. (laughs) - Girls, girls. - You would soon want to be free if he was no more than an escape. - Free, you call this free? You're not the only one who dreams of Rome, Paris-- - London. - Some hope. - I translated them all ages ago. I've got the book at home. - Indeed, well let's see how you do with this. Do you think you could translate exercise three? - Um, oh yes. The bag in which I put your papers is under the table. Have you the key? - Uh, one minute. - Give it to the servant. - Very good, but please read the French first and then the translation. - Read the French? Out loud? - Yes please. - Well, um (speaking foreign language) (laughing) - Who on earth taught you French? - [Laura Voiceover] Dear Mother. I'm only in the first class. Miss Day says you didn't teach me at home according to the curr, curr-- - Curr, curriculum. Her spelling hasn't improved. I don't like Mrs. Gurley who is thin and never smiles and says, "Lilith Gordon, you will take a conduct mark," as if she was sending her to the guillotine. - Oh dear. - Go on Mother, go on! - The Reverend Mr. Strachey is the principal and he is very tall and proud, and has a drooping mustache and is lu, lugubrious like a spaniel. - Let us pray. Oh mighty heavenly father, we beseech thee to harken unto the voices of thy poor sinners here below. - Settling in? - [Mr. Strachey] Who like sheep have gone astray. - Yes, thank you. - [Mr. Strachey] Vouchsafe us thy blessing - Oh, there's that mouse again. - [Mr. Strachey] this day, oh Lord. (screams) (laughing) - [Mr. Strachey] And grant that our transgressions-- - Trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding. (clock chiming) - The wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of fools. - Take not from the right hand nor from the left, remove thy foot from evil. - Happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding. - Look at these toffs. - Aren't they a pair of nanny goats? (upbeat band music) (laughing and shouting) - Have you played before? - Of course. (cheering and applauding) - Laura, you come and have a try. (cries out) - I'm terribly sorry, Miss Zielinski! - It's all right, it's okay. - You sure? - No motion has she now, no force, she, she neither hears nor sees, rolled round in earth's-- - Diurnal, Lilith, diurnal. - Diurnal course with rocks and stones and trees. (snickers) - Laura Rambotham, do you consider this a shattering example of Mr. Wordworth's humor, or is it Lilith's sensitive rendering that convulses you? - Actually it's Wordsworth. I think he's inclined to be rather insipid, don't you? - Really? - Shakespeare's vastly superior. - You are of course intimately acquainted with the bard? - Yes, intimately. - No doubt you could favor us with an example. - Well, Wordsworth could never have written Macbeth, could he? Oh come you spirits that tend of mortal thought, unsex me here, and fill me from crown to toe top-full of direst cruelty. Make thick my blood. Stop up the access and passage to remorse that no compunctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose. - And then she went and cracked Zieli square on the nose. - That wouldn't have been a joke to Zieli I bet. She's a Jew. - She isn't! - I hear her father's a scruffy little Jewish tailor in Footscray or somewhere awful. Don't know where they find some of these teachers! Or pupils. Hey, are you gonna make yourself useful, or are you just for decoration? - Don't suppose they have stays in that native camp you live in. - My mother says I don't need stays with my figure. - I knew it, I knew it! She's not a girl, she's a boy! Save me Bertha, save me! - Oh Lilith, she's all right. (bells ring) - She's the rummest character I've ever met. Hey Bertha. (speaking foreign language) - How was I supposed to know how to pronounce it? - And Shakespeare, who could like Shakespeare? - Well I do! - Unsex me here. - Quiet girls, lights are out. - Shh, shh, listen. (clinking) Oh what's that, is that you Miss Day? Miss Day, Miss Day, are you there Miss Day? Miss Day! - Yeth, Lilith? - I heard a noise and I got frightened. - Go to thleep, Lilith. - Are you all right, Miss Day? Voice sounds funny. - Go to thleep, Lilith. - Goodnight Miss Day. - Goodnight, Lilith. - Goodnight Miss Day. - Bertha, go to thleep! - Goodnight Miss Day! - Laura, go to thleep! (laughing) - This place you come from, War-what's-a-name. I suppose it's the name of your property. - The town. We went there to live after Father died. - Must be hard on your mother, being a widow. - She says she hasn't time to feel sorry for herself. She works terribly hard. - She works! - You're not supposed to be eating outside the school grounds, Lilith. - Bloomin' stuck up thing. Just because she's Miss Evelyn Souttar and so filthy rich. I hate snobs. - So do I. My mother says it shows bad breeding. - She's right, too! (bicycle bell rings) What's this work she does? - Most of her spare time she's sewing. - She's not, not a dressmaker! - I should say not. She does the most lovely embroidery. Once she made a piano cover and got 50 pounds for it. And look, she did this. - I say. - Mostly she does children's dresses and things. They're all in silk and terribly fine. Of course she can only do it at night. - Oh, why's that? - Because she's minding the post office all day. She has to run it practically entirely by herself. - Well fancy, a post office. - My father's promised me a trip overseas when I matriculate. - Overseas. Stupid old New Zealand, I bet. I'll be going to England and my uncle in Brisbane has promised me a gold watch. - If he can afford it. - Of course he can. - What's he do, your uncle? - Oh he's got tons of money. - So she likes to say. I bet he's a butcher. - [Girl] Or an undertaker. - Or a night soil man. - He happens to own the biggest newspaper in Brisbane! - Her uncle keeps a newspaper! How terribly rum. Does he leave it on the front doorstep every morning? - Or set it on the corner? Paper, get your paper here! All the latest news, only a penny. - You say another word Laura Rambotham and I'll tell 'em your mother's a scruffy little postmistress who does sewing! Then see what happens to you. - Now no blatherskiting Tweedledum. - Of course not. At home we're frequently being asked out to drawing rooms and things. - Now you girls behave yourselves. Remember it's a great privilege to be invited to these afternoons. - Great bloomin' bore, you mean. - It's all right for you, Tweedledum. New girls aren't asked to do anything. - Only good thing about it is we get cream buns for tea. (bell ringing) - I say is my waist all right? - Good afternoon, young ladies. Do come in, - Good afternoon, - lovely day, is it not? - Mrs. Strachey. - Hats and coats on the pegs in the hall. That's right. Good afternoon. (clock chiming) May I present, um, Miss Gordon. - How do you do, Miss Gordon? - How do you do, Mr. Strachey? - And uh, Miss, Miss Morell. - Miss Morell, how do you do? - And it's, oh yes it's Miss Ramsbottom. - Tweedle Rambotham. How do you do, Mr. Strachey? - How do you do, Miss-- - What a perfectly splendid room! All those marvelous books! Do they all belong to you, Mr. Strachey? We have stacks of books at home too. I've read them all, every one. I love to read, and the school library's just awful, isn't it? Oh, isn't that nice? - Well, Mr. Strachey, shall we all sit down? - Ladies. (clears throat) Well now, and which of you young ladies is to be the first with her cultural offering? I see Miss-- - Miss Courtney. - Miss Courtney has her violin with her. - If you please, Bach Partita number two. - Ah. Old father Bach, most suitable. (melancholy violin music) - Mrs. Gurley, I, I have included Laura among the girls for the afternoon at Mr. Strachey's. After all, new girl-- - Yes, very well. But it is important that the principal does not gain the wrong impression of the girls. Breeding, Miss Chapman. - Oh, but she's, I mean I think she is well-bred. A little willful, perhaps, but. - How doth the little busy bee improve each shining hour and gather honey all the day from every opening flower? In work of labor or of skill I would be busy too. For Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do. (applauding) - Dr. Isaac Watts has there a commendable sentiment, has he not? - And now perhaps Miss Gordon? - Oh, well I've been learning a new song, Dawn Maiden, and Miss Hicks said I had to try to accompany myself, but I'm terribly sorry, I've wrenched my little finger. - I'm sure we'll all make allowances. - [Mr. Strachey] Excellent, allow me to assist. (piano note sounds) - Ooh! Oh, I'm terribly sorry Mr. Strachey, but it does hurt awfully. - Perhaps one of our other aspiring pianists might? - I could play it. - No! - You know it, Miss? - No, but I could probably play it from sight. - But she doesn't even take music! - Oh yes, I've played much harder things than that at home. (piano trill) (gentle music) ♪ Out of her bed one morning ♪ ♪ The dawn came with a rush ♪ ♪ I saw her fleeting stealing ♪ ♪ Her radiance filled the bush ♪ ♪ I thought I heard her cooing ♪ ♪ To those her do her will ♪ ♪ And soon she lit each corner ♪ ♪ And touched each distant hill ♪ (applauding) - Did you learn that piece here? - Oh no. I wouldn't care to play the things they teach here. They're so dull! - Indeed. Then perhaps you can play us something of your own choosing. (complex, peaceful piano music) (moving into dramatic music) (clock ticking) (laughs) - Young ladies do not pass impertinent comment. Nor do young ladies desecrate the walls of the principal's sitting room with music fit only for cheap theatrical entertainment. - But I wasn't impertinent. I was only trying to be polite. Mother said-- - How dare you interrupt me when I am speaking? The first thing, miss, for you to do will be to take a course of lessons in manners. Your present ones may have done well enough in the remote parts from whence you came. They will not do here in the company of your betters. You will stand for one hour before the honor board. Miss Chapman? - I really do feel Mrs. Gurley was too harsh on the child. Really, too harsh. - Well she'll just have to learn to fit in, won't she? - Indeed she will. - And there is no doubt she is singularly gifted. Miss Hicks agrees. - Thalberg's hardly suitable, but, the technical demands for a child of 14? - Blast! Pity. - Really. I do wish you would stop that. The smell. Mrs. Gurley will be returning in a minute. You know her attitude. - I know she objects to our unbridled bacchanalias. - And the music, and of course it is me-- - She's been toadying to that frightful Lilith Gordon right from the start. Yesterday I caught her smuggling a cake upstairs for her. - Mrs. Gurley? - Miss Rambotham. - I'm going to open the front door to let some of this smoke out. If Mrs. Gurley returns. - What do you think of her, Zieli? - Mrs. Gurley? - Miss Rambotham. - Oh, Laura. I like her. As my father would say, (speaking foreign language) (snorts) ("Mi Par D'udir Ancora," Georges Bizet) - Lilith. Please, Lilith. - I don't see why I should speak to you ever again, Laura Rambotham. - I've said I was sorry, over and over. - I wouldn't have had to sing at all, but you had to go and show off. - I didn't mean to! - You don't belong here, that's the trouble! You don't belong and you never will. I've a good mind to tell them everything about your mother! Then everyone would cut you dead forever. - Lilith, please! I'll do anything you like but please don't tell anyone! I want to belong! I'll try ever so hard! I'll remember dates, and only play the right music, and try to behave like a lady. Truly, I promise! I'll try and try! (train chugging) (train whistle blowing) No, I took out the line in the sewing class. Where did you get that dress? - Isn't it pretty? Mother made it from an old curtain she found. - Let's hope she's not making anything like that for me. - Oh Laura, it's wonderful, six whole weeks! Mum said she's sorry she couldn't come to meet you, she's got all sorts of telegraph messages coming through 'cause it's nearly Christmas. She's still the same with the Morse key. (laughing) - The servants are terribly correct and starchy, and they wear caps with streamers. - I'd sooner wear a ring through me nose. - And they're terribly polite and say, "Will you take beef, Miss?" (laughing) - Oh, I'll have to practice. - But being put up two classes. - The only other girl they put up two classes was Tilly Macnamara. She's older than me. - Darling I'm so terribly proud. - But we always knew she was brilliant, didn't we? - It's just remembering things, that's all. Except for arithmetic and dates. - Tell us about your friends, are they nice? - Just about the most socially important in the entire school. - Well, fancy. - Tilly Macnamara, her father's a banker in Ballarat and terribly rich. And I'll be in the same class now as Maria Morell. And her father's an important surgeon. And her friend Kate's father's a grazier. - What's a grazier? - A farmer, love. - No he isn't. There is a difference. Lilith Gordon's father owns just about the biggest emporium in Melbourne. I suppose you'd call him a shopkeeper. - Suppose I would too. - If he's got a big shop why don't you ask him if Mother can do some shawls for him? - Oh, Pin. - Well the biggest shop in Wangaratta asked you to do some and you seem to always need more money. - That's enough, Pin dear. Oh my darling, it's going to be a wonderful, wonderful Christmas. (dog barking) Made by the best dressmaker in town, dear. - It's a real beauty. (chattering) - [Woman] Miss Goodnik. - Miss Rambotham. You will report to Miss Hicks for piano lessons. Miss Chapman is under the delusion that you have musical talent. - Yes, Mrs. Gurley. - Evelyn, my dear child, have you enjoyed your holiday in Sydney? - Yes, thank you, Mrs. Gurley. I must have gone to at least a dozen parties. - Your dear parents are well? No running! Ladies do not run. - Miss Anderson, Miss Trevelyan! - Evelyn's such a Miss High and Mighty, thinks she's Queen Victoria. Well I thought it quite hysterical. He kept going on about you looking like a young Madonna. Says you've got sloe eyes. - But I've never spoken to your cousin. - Doesn't count, he's seen you in church. He made me absolutely promise to invite you over to lunch one weekend. Oh, it's Lilith. Bet she's furious you'll be a senior, serve her right. - Tilly, Kate! (chattering) - Hello. - Oh, hello. - Did you have a nice holiday? - Yes, thank you, lovely. - I do like your hair that way. - Miss Souttar, Miss Souttar! - [Girl] It was just awful, bush fires all through Christmas. We nearly got burnt out! - And did we do some mathematics on our holiday, Miss Rambotham? - Oh yes, Dr. Pughson. - Good. - [Girl] Daddy gave me this (drowned out by chatter) - Well, You're certainly getting too big for your boots. Hobnobbing with the nobs. I don't suppose we're good enough for you now. - I bet she asked to be moved from our room too. - Oh no I didn't, truly! I've got a really scrumptious cake, Lilith, especially for you. And some jam too. - With cherries? - Now that's enough, that's enough chatters. Everyone upstairs and unpack, and no running! - Laura, Laura! - Ladies do not run. Move along girls, enough chatter, no running. - Well at least you won't have to write any more of Lilith's essays for her. - [Laura] Thank goodness. - What do you want? - Miss, she told me I was to-- - Landed a new kid. - What's your name, where are you from? - Annie Johns. - Your father a Chinaman? (laughing) Your name Chinky? - No. - I bet he takes in laundry. - No, he-- - What's he do then? Market gardening? - No, he's a chemist. - A chemist? In a shop? With sealing wax and pink string and nasty things in bottles? - Yes, that is-- - How much does he make a year? - I don't know, not very much. - Lord, we might as well become a state school. Well, whatever your name is, you'd better hurry up. Prayers are in five minutes. Say, did I show you my new silk? - No. It's lovely. - Not bad. I wanna bring it in at the waist. Now we're out of those ghastly pinafores, we can dress up a bit. Would you button me? You certainly are a rum looking kid. - Fancy putting you straight into four. - Why didn't you start here years ago? - We didn't have enough money. - Oh, Laura dear, do pass me my handkerchief. Next she'll be asking for donations. (bell chimes) Oh fiddle, there's the first bell. I wanna bag a seat next to Maria. Coming Laura? - In a minute. You'd better hurry. - I shouldn't have come here, it's only for rich girls. - Won't help being a baby. You can sort these later. Better come downstairs with me. Oh, and if anyone says anything about a mouse in the middle of prayers, don't take any notice. Come on! - Actually, he was quite good looking. 20 if he was a day! - Oh, Maria, then what happened? - My lips are sealed! - Tell me! - Not in front of the children, they still believe babies grow under gooseberry bushes! - Maria, of course we don't! - Of course not! - Come on, tell me what happened with that Harry! - Well... I say, Kate, you are getting (whispers) All those visiting men teachers this year, too! (whistles) Deuteronomy 22! - Steady on, Maria. - Poor old Tweedledum here, flat as a pancake. Should have to stuff hankies down her bodice just to get them interested. - [Mrs. Gurley] What are you girls doing? - (gasps) Brimstone, she'll catch us, let's get away! - [Mrs. Gurley] Time and time again, 10 minutes is enough. - What did she mean Deuteronomy 22? - Don't ask me! - The lesson today is from - Laura, - Proverbs Chapter 4. - There's my cousin. - Get wisdom, get understanding, forget it not. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee. Love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the principle thing, therefore, get wisdom. And with all thy getting, get understanding. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee. She shall bring thee to honor when thou dost embrace her. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace. A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. (organ music) - Look, there's adultery! And a lot about forn, fornication? What's that mean? - How do you spell it? - What's this about, "a man shall not discover his father's skirt"? - "Father's skirt"? (thumping) - The new minister! (excited whispering) - [Girl] What a mash! - [Girl] Oh, I'm gonna faint! (sighs) - Is he married? - [Girl] His wife and sister are here today. (excited whispering) - Let us now praise God with Hymn Number 709. (triumphant organ music) ♪ Praise God, from whom all blessings flow ♪ ♪ Praise him, all creatures here below ♪ ♪ Praise him above, ye heavenly host ♪ ♪ Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ (bell chimes) (giggling) - [Girl] Anyway, anyway, then the baby starts coming. - It's all the places that ride open. - All too grisly! - You ought to have heard my mother screaming! - Golly, well look at the size of any baby! - Sometimes they get stuck, don't they? - Mmhm, and whenever it eventually does come out, there's always bits of stomach twirled around them, and they get pulled out too, and they have to pick them up and shove them back in! - Mm, there's blood everywhere! - You haven't had any. It's your cake! (giggling) (lively piano music) - You taught yourself that during the holidays? - There wasn't that much to do. - Well, my dear! Well, another half hour's practice, Laura. (violin exercises) (dramatic piano music) - That sounded very like Thalberg to me. - Oh, truly, I didn't know what I was playing! I wasn't thinking. - You play like that when you're not thinking? No wonder Hicks is in a dither. This impromptu's absolutely defeating me. - I won't! I won't let them do that to me! - Who, do what? - Men, do that! - Oh. - And I won't get married, and I won't have babies, and I won't let them do that. - All right, that's settled. Now calm down! What have those little monsters been telling you, anyway? Probably a pack of lies? - Lies? - Well, stories! What they don't know, they make up. If it was all so terrible, why would people go on wanting to getting married and having babies? Nobody makes them, do they? Besides, men can't help being different. Have you ever thought that they might be just as scared of women? Think of poor Mr. Gurley. (laughing) That's better! I believe there's only one thing in this life to be scared of, and that's music exams. (peaceful piano music) - Oh, this weekend Tweedledum, you show your stuff. You glue 'im! Just throw him sheep's eyes 'til he's soft as a jelly, then let him be 'til he practically runs to water! - Oh, I agree, the waterier, the better. - Oh, Tweedledum. One thing about Bob. He's awfully keen on elegant, well-dressed women. So do make an effort. - 'Course. (chattering) - Well, well. Walk up, walk up, for the peep show. Only a penny for the peep show! Tweedledum's got a new dress. - [Laura] Lilith, shut up! - Guaranteed to blind you at ten paces. What a guy! It's the best yet! - Be quiet, Lilith! It's not mine! - Who else would have a thing like that? - It belonged to a girl who died! Her mother sent it to me as a remembrance of her. - Oh, oh so now we wear secondhand clothes. - Don't you dare tell anyone that! - I'm going to tell everything about you. About this awful dress, and about your horrid mother, working in a horrid post office and doing dressmaking! - And I'll tell them your mother's a drunk! - What? - Yes, and you try and hide her away, but sometimes she gets out! And she puts mustard on her pudding and she can't feed herself properly! And you can't even let her have a knife because she might cut somebody's throat! - It's not true! - I can still tell everyone, can't I? And they'll believe me! So you shut up and leave me alone! (birds chirping) I suppose you play cricket? - Naturally. I'm vice-captain of the school's first 11. - How nice. I play, too. - Chocky, chocky, chocky, chocky, chocky! - Ah, Miss Ra, Ra, Rambotham, em, are you aware this son of mine aspires to be a deadly lady-killer? - Lady-killer yourself, Pa! - Chuck it, Pater. - Why uncle, stop fooling. - Fooling? Me? It's a fact! ♪ Oh the ladies love him so ♪ - Tom. - Put no trust in Robert, Miss Ra-Ra-Rambotham. - Ra-Ra-Ram's Bottie! - Thumbkin, you're so sharp you'll cut yourself. - I'll cut you, Pa, into little bits! - Howzat? Caught in the slips! (laughing) (gentle piano music) - Thought Tilly's cousin had a mash on you. You lost interest in him? Or vice versa! - I wasn't interested in him in the first place. - Nothing to do with sour grapes or sour oranges I suppose? - She's got a much better mash than him, and not just a horrid dirty conceited boy, either! - Ho hum! Who? - You wait and see. - Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God and knoweth God. Whosoever loveth not, knoweth not God. For God is - [Minister And Laura] Love. (whispering) - Let us now praise God with hymn number 479. Love divine, all loves excelling. (bells chiming) - Come along now, girls. Come along, everybody. - Come on, Kiddy, no fooling around. Has she got a mash on that chap, the minister chap? - None of your business! What if he's got a mash on her? If I was a man I would too. (chattering) - Go on, it's not true! - What? - What Chinky let on, you and the minister! - Come along now girls, form up, form up, everybody. Come along, that's right. - Miss Chapman? - Hm? - I'm sorry, I think I've left one of my gloves in the pew. - Hurry then, dear, you can catch us up. - Thank you. - [Miss Chapman] You ready now, girls, all in line. All right, quick march! - She didn't leave the glove behind, I saw, she's going back to see him! - She wouldn't dare! - Oh Miss Chapman, I think I know where Laura left her glove! May I? - Very well, my dear. Do hurry. And don't run! - Well if it's not true, then would they meeting secretly in the vestry? I saw her go in there! - But you didn't see him. - A married man, I think that's a bit steep. - And you seen his wife all quiet and mousy. - And his sister, all thin and mean. - What about him? He's divine. - Disgusting, he's a minister of the Lord. - Ooh, wouldn't I like to know what's going on! - If anything. - Come along there, Laura. Why are you late? Come along, ladies! Form into line now! Come along! Everybody ready? Very well. Buckles in, brooches out. Ready, and! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. One, two, three, four, five-- - They're saying the most awful things about you and Reverend Shepherd. - [Miss Day] 13, 14, 15, 16. - If they want to believe it, let them. - [Miss Day] No, talking Laura! (organ music) - You got a plan to meet him today? (mumbles) - You watch out, Laura Rambotham, that witch of a wife's been eyeing us all like hawks. I bet she's onto something. - Oh Laura, my dear. This is the child you asked me about. Come along, dear. - Now you've gone too far. - May I present Miss Laura Tweedle Rambotham. Laura, this is Mrs. Shepherd and Miss Shepherd. - How do you do? - Come on, spill it! What did she say? - She's invited me to stay next weekend! - I can't believe it! - Well, how's that for cram! - You don't have to believe me. - All right, everybody move. (piano scales) - I was just putting away your things and I saw this letter from your mother. She's asking an old friend to write to Mr. Shepherd and you might be asked to visit. - You little beast! - Laura, it was just a joke, I started it, I'll tell the girls that! - Shut up! Don't you dare tell anyone, not anyone! - Please, please stop telling crams, Laura! - They're not crams, only stories. And this one's true! I do love him, I do! I'm sure he must love me, he must! (whispering) - She told me the sister's in on the whole thing! - Why did she ever take that old crow he married? - Well I won't believe it 'til I see her go with my own eyes! - Quiet, ladies! May we hear your selection from God's holy scripture Miss Rambotham. - My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. I rose up and opened to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, (whispering) my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. - Thank you, Miss Rambotham. - I opened my beloved-- - That will do! - Here we are, Laura. - Shh! He has just lain down for a few minutes. How do you do, my dear? - How do you do? - [Both Adults] Shh! - Perhaps you would like to go and unpack, dear. Then come straight down for lunch. Robby does so hate being kept waiting. - Thank you. - [Both Adults] Shh. - Thank you. - I'll show Laura her room. You see to lunch, Maisie. Shh! - Oh dear. It's nearly one. (sighs) I do hope we'll not have to waken him. - [Robby] Maisie! - He can't find something - Ah! And so this is the young lady from the halls of learning. This is the day the Lord has made, let us be glad and rejoice in it, amen. - Amen. - And so, what do they teach you at the College then, Miss, eh? French, Greek, Latin? How goes it? Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorum, er, what was it? - Trojanas ut opes et lamentabile regnum eruerint Danai. - Hm. Well well well, an excellent memory for Latin, I see. - I can remember pages of anything. We're doing Virgil this year. - So, here we are again. Not a scrap! Not a scrap of mustard! - With mutton, Robby dear? - With mutton, if I choose! - Yes, dear, of course. Oh dear, I'm so terribly, terribly-- - And the water, and the glasses! - Oh Maisie! And Robby so rushed! Poor, dear Robby, always so busy, always so rushed. And, alas getting so little help from poor Maisie. Dear no, is Robby and I can do is consistently bring her forgetfulness to her notice. If I offered to help, it would only encourage her faults. Really, Robby has the patience of an angel. Now, what would you like to do today? - Well, I don't really mind. - Oh good then, you won't mind staying in. I do so want to copy Robby's sermon for tomorrow. He can't read his own handwriting. Oh, do make yourself quite at home, won't you? We have a little supper at six. (knocking) The poor, dear boy. He has a working men's class at seven, just has to save his voice. (piano scales) - All right then, let's have it, Kiddy, what happened? - The truth! - All right, nothing! - [Girls] Nothing? - Did the old horror of a wife cotton on? - Of course not, there's nothing to cotton on to, anyway. - Ooh, she doesn't wanna tell, I bet it's too dashed shady. - Or disgusting! - Or of course there could be nothing to tell, anyway. - Oh, isn't there just! - Well, go on! - Well, he's just the most, most-- - Scrumptious? - Gorgeous? - Heavenly? - All right, scrumptious, gorgeous, heavenly, divine! - What about the bride? - Oh, well she's just an old cat! Nag, nag, nagging him the whole time. Robby has the patience of an angel! - Robby! - Why did he marry her? - Well... She had lots of money. He was terribly poor, and wanted to be a clergyman. And so she paid for him. - And now the old vulture wants her pound of flesh. - It's awful, he's half-starved, and she won't give him another penny! - You mean, he's a blinking pauper? - He comes from a terribly distinguished family. His father was a lord or a baronet or something who married beneath him. Yes, and got left out of a will! So although he's heir to the title, Robby's terribly poor. - I say! - So what can he do? What can we do? Divorce is out of the question. - Holy Moses! (sighs) - [Robby] Good heavens! - Oh! I'm terribly sorry. I only knocked very softly. I thought you said come in. - What can I do for you, young lady? - I'm Laura Tweedle Rambotham. From the College. - Ah, yes, yes, of course, ah, you came to stay. - Yes. And you quoted from Virgil to me. And I'm having such trouble with my translations. - Well I believe you have some very fine teachers at the College. - Yes, but well, you did say, you said, if you could help. - Did I? - What is she doing in there? - Absurd, how do we know he's even in the vestry? (chattering) (gasping) (dramatic piano music) - Besides, I don't believe a minister would stoop to such a sordid intrigue with a child of 15. - Aw, come off it, M.P. Juliet was only 13! - Hm! She was Italian, and Roman Catholic. (whispering) - If they ever live in sin, she'll be a scarlet woman! - But how do they get to France if he's so poor? - Didn't you hear, one of his bush relatives just died, Lord something or other, and left them a fortune! (sighs) (bell rings) - Come on, this is us. - What's it say? - It's poetry. - Again? Read it! - You'll only think I'm conceited. - Come on, let's hear it! - It's called Oh Wondrous Fair. I saw thee there amidst the throng, with voices raised in godly song. A child thou mayest to the world yet seem, thy sloe eyes and thy skin of cream, yet I do love thee, sprite of air, my own, my blessed, wondrous fair. (admiring chatter) - So when are you planning to elope? - Maybe sooner than you think. - I hope it's not before next Sunday. It might be a bit awkward. Reverend Shepherd met my father at the church conference. They've invited me to spend the weekend. I do hope you won't be too jealous. Despicable liar! - No wonder you've been hiding, you rotten, stinking, lying skunk! - I'm not! - [Girl] I knew what she was like the day she arrived. (chattering) - And all that meeting in the vestry, thinking you could fool us! - Here's to our love-- - [Girl] She has no moral character at all. - Ugh! All those lies about a man of God! - You made me do it! You didn't have to believe me! It's all your own fault! - Our fault, what about that? - My cousin Bob just laughed at her. - Yes, her mother runs a scruffy post office and does dressmaking! - She doesn't! - You and your filthy crams. I'll never speak to you again, Laura Rambotham, ever. - Someone ought to tell Mrs. Gurley and have you expelled. - Best thing that could happen, filthy little beast. - [Chinky] You're worth a thousand thousand of them, Laura. - Go away, Chinky. - If I was a boy, I'd think you were the loveliest girl in the whole world. You've got such lovely eyes. And hair. And the most beautiful hands. You should wear rings on your fingers to show how beautiful they are. I'd love to give you a ring, Laura. - Where would you get one? - If I did get you one, would you wear it? - I'd have to see it first. Go away, Chinky. (chattering) - [Girl] There she is. (simple piano music) - Hold on, what's this I hear about you telling lurid stories for weeks? You must tell me! - Let's hope the Reverend Shepherd doesn't get to hear of it. - Let us hope, Miss Day, Mrs. Gurley doesn't get to hear of it. - I think Laura should write it all down. She can try for the school's fiction prize as well as the music one. (chattering) (door clicks) (door slams) - Let us read from God's holy word. Knoweth ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor revilers, nor drunkards shall inherit the kingdom of God. Therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, said the Lord God, that they shall bear their iniquities. We thank the Lord for the guidance of his holy word. Miss Annie Johns! Annie Johns! Self-confessed you stand there! A dissembler, and a thief! Threepence from Miss Mowbray's pocket. One shilling from Miss Jackson's pinafore. Sixpence from the school's Fijian Mission collection. One guinea from the drawer of Miss Macnamara, your own roommate. When charged with your wickedness, you could offer no explanation but a desire for personal adornment. Indeed, the purchase of a ring, for your finger. A ring for her finger! And what did it profit the painted Jezebel that she adorned herself in jewels and silken raiment? The servant of the Lord cast her down, and her flesh was consumed, yea, even by the very dogs! You shall sip the cup of sorrow with a spoon of grief. Even as the son of God cast out the unclean spirit from the man of the Gazarenes, so too do we cast out evil, that our bodies may be made pure and once more cleansed. Herewith, Annie Johns, I expel you from this school! Leave it! Now, this minute! Let us pray. Almighty and everlasting God, who thyself through our redeemer was tempted and did not fall, grant us grace also to overcome the temptations of the flesh and the ungodly, and raise thou in thy infinite mercy, save from the wrath to come the soul of this, thy daughter, who like a sheep has gone astray. ("Mi Par D'udir Ancora," Georges Bizet) - Laura, you're not supposed to be here. What is it? - It was my fault. She was buying that ring for me. - I see. - No, you don't. I just noticed stupid things, like she hadn't cleaned her boots, and there was a lace undone, and I was scared she'd say something about me. I didn't care about Chinky at all. - But you couldn't have asked her to steal. - I know what I should do. I should go and tell Mr. Strachey and Mrs. Gurley, shouldn't I? - Don't be so absurd. You're not going to tell anyone, you couldn't. - No I couldn't, 'cause they'd treat me the same way! Everyone knows my mother's just a postmistress and does embroidery. I know what it's like not to have lots of pocket-money and beautiful clothes. - My dear Laura. - Don't you dare patronize me! Go away. - I am. I'm leaving at the end of term. (train chugging) - I thought you said you lived somewhere out by Corowa? - My mother's ill. My sister and I are going to stay with a great-aunt. - Sounds jolly. Still the beach should be fun, and you can spend the time making up more sensational stories to tell the girls next year. - It wasn't all my fault about the stories. - My dear girl, we're only sorry we didn't hear all the weekly installments. Zieli here couldn't get enough of them. Wouldn't we all like to have the imagination to be the scarlet Woman. Reality's mostly damned unbearable. One has to escape into something. - And you know what? I wouldn't be at all surprised if Mr. O'Donnell proposes to Sarah. - Sarah? Must be 40 if she's a day. - What does that matter? Except she hasn't got many teeth now. One fell out the other day, wasn't that awful? - Bloomin' shattering! - Well it was, for Sarah! Laura, what's been happening at that school? - What do you mean? - You haven't told us anything in your letters. - 'Cause there's nothing to tell! - I'm sure you've done something horrid, but you won't talk about it. You've changed, even Sarah says so. - I don't give a darn what Sarah says! - I'm going to tell Mother on you! I'm going to tell Mother you use bad words, too, like darn, and gosh, and blooming! - You beastly little leech! - Ow! It's all your fault Mother's been ill, because she nearly worked herself to death making money for you and sewing clothes for you! And you don't care! You told her they were awful and you'd rather go naked, and you hurt her so much-- - Shut up! - And Sarah says you'll be the death of her! - Shut up, shut up, shut up! (yelping) - I hate you, I hate you, you're mean and you're horrible! - Well at least I'm not a stupid, ugly, moon-faced, spindly-legged country bumpkin! Pin, Pin, thin as a pin! Good riddance! - But you must have heard about Maria! - Only a card at Christmas, she didn't answer my letter. - She's got herself engaged! (excited shouting) - Who to? - A missionary! She's gonna live among the blacks in Fiji! (giggling) - Kate's not coming back either. - She said a woman doesn't need an education, it's a waste of time. - A waste of her time, anyway, she'd never have passed her matric. (giggling) I see you-know-who's turned up again. (girls groan) The cheek! - Really, now there are so few girls worth knowing. - [Lilith] Well, it's not quite the done thing to know her, is it? (laughing) - Personally, I don't mind failing, I'd rather another year here than back to father's horrid sheep station. (sighs) - Oh, you're in with us? - I'm terribly sorry, M.P. I asked Chappy to put me in somewhere else. - Oh well, what can't be cured must be endured, but we expect you to behave, don't we Cupid? - Oh, my word we do, no more fairy tales. - Of course not! I've been praying for forgiveness. Can I help you with your unpacking, M.P.? I'd like to. - Well, all right. - Please forgive me for all my sins. Teach me the way to righteousness. Sow acceptance with my friends. - Laura leave something to ask him tomorrow. - Help me to get acceptance with everyone! (chalk squeaks) - I say, this Humble Harriet act is laid on a bit thick, isn't it? - I do think the child's making a sincere effort to reform. - She always was a bit of a toady though, wasn't she? (tentative piano music) - Hello. - I thought you weren't coming back. - I thought you weren't. How's your mother? - All right. - My parents are still in Europe, so here I am again. - I want to say I was sorry for being so awful to you. - I didn't blame you. - That Schubert, it's really not hard. - Maybe not for you. Miss Hicks says the trouble is I try only to play from the heart. And Laura Rambotham plays only from her head. (flowing piano music) - You may be of use to her, Laura, but that does not mean she will accept you socially. - Evelyn Souttar's always been choosy about who she mixes with. - Actually I'm surprised she isn't mixing with us. Did you know my parents have met her uncle, Sir Charles? - You do realize, Laura Rambotham, that I have been decent to you only out of pure Christian charity. (knocking at door) - Come in. (laughing) Say it again! - It wasn't supposed to be funny. - Go on, that bit about thy sloe eyes and thy skin of cream, yet do I love thee, sprite of air, my own, my-- - My blessed wondrous fair. (laughing) I know, it's awful! But they didn't. - I'd no idea you'd gone so far. - It was wrong of me, I know. M.P. says lying's as bad as stealing. - Rot! M.P. and the Ladies College don't make the rules for the whole world. - What do you think of boys? They're awful conceited beasts, don't you think? - Well-- - Tell me, go on. Say what you think they are. - Oh, mostly fools. What was the wretched man like anyway? - [Laura] Awful! Conceited and self-centered and mean and bossy. "Mustard with mutton, Robby dear?" "With mutton if I choose!" - [Evelyn] Oh no! - You should have seen the servings, I nearly starved to death! - It's so incredible that they should believe a man like that could be in love with a kid like you. Oh, don't you take yourself seriously! (laughing) - For wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions. - [Evelyn] What's that? - Just my verse! Proverbs, Chapter Eight. I don't think I understand it. - Don't worry, just say it to Mrs. Gurley as if you do. What's mine? I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me. Proverbs 8:17. - [Miss Snodgrass] Now the sailor's speech from Twelfth Night. Laura? - Wants her Evey-Wevey. - [Miss Snodgrass] Someone else? - Well, look at Her Lauraship, off to the theater. - Very high and mighty. - Are you sure you'll be all right, my dear? - Quite, thank you, Miss Chapman. My uncle and aunt are meeting us at the theater. - [Miss Chapman] Enjoy yourselves! - Her poverty-stricken mother will be thrilled when she fails the examinations. - Odd friendship, Evelyn and little Laura. - Oh, I don't know. Nobody talks to Laura, Evelyn talks to nobody. - Hm? (dramatic opera music) (applauding) - Excellent, excellent! - Wonderful, isn't it, Evey? - Sir Charles? - James, my boy! Good to see you. - [James] Evelyn. - Jim! Oh, Laura, this is Mr. James Meredith. Miss Rambotham! - How do you do? - I'm going out for a cigar, care to join me? - In a moment, sir. Are you enjoying the performance? - Very much! How long are you staying in Melbourne? - Only for a few days. One of my father's-- - James and Evelyn are old friends, you know. They've known each other since childhood. - I hope I shall see you in Ballarat this summer. - I'm afraid not. - Evelyn tells me that you're musical yourself. - Mother wrote and said she wanted to spend the summer-- - What instrument is it you play? The cello I believe. - Piano. No, I didn't enjoy myself, if that's what you want to know. - What is the matter with you? - Nothing, nothing at all. - Well, that's all right then. - You think nothing of telling lies, do you? - Depends, what are you referring to? - You said you thought they were all fools, and then you go and behave like that tonight. - Oh, so that's it. - The whole evening after he came, you hardly spoke to me again. You hardly even looked at me! - Jim's an old friend, I haven't seen him for ages! - I hate him! And I hate you! - I shall survive. - Five. Six. - Hoopla! Which do you prefer, the brown or the blue? I can't decide. - Eight. Nine. (laughing) - Poor little Miss Lovesick. - Yes, thank you, Mrs. Gurley. - What were you telling her? - Nothing. - [Laura] Why'd you have to see her? - [Evelyn] I'll tell you later. - [Laura] Did you talk about me? - [Evelyn] No. - Chapman! - Mrs. Gurley, yes? - That strange Rambotham child, how are her studies progressing? - Well they perhaps-- - Poorly, Snodgrass tells me, poorly. What can one expect? - You're leaving aren't you? Your parents are coming back. - Yes. - [Laura] When? - Soon, a few weeks. - I won't let you go! (laughing) - Laura-- - Suppose you're planning to get married. - One day. You don't expect me to be an old maid, do you? Me? - I hate men. I hate them! - [Evelyn] You'll change your mind in a couple of years. - I won't. I thought you liked me best. - Laura-- - Evey, I won't share you with anybody. Do you have to leave now? Can't you wait until... You want to leave. To leave me. - Yes. Can't you see what you're doing? You're suffocating me, Laura! Have you forgotten you own work? You're making us both unhappy. I'm sick of the Ladies College. Of being walled in. - Right, girls, 9:30. Laura? - Exams in two weeks. You'll never catch up now. (angry piano music) - Won't you even say goodbye? You've hardly spoken these past weeks. You will write? We'll see each other again. Often. - I don't see how. You'll be married, we'll be miles apart. We'll hardly be mixing in the same circles, will we? - I shall miss you. Very much. Always. - Please Lord, please help me pass my final exams, please Lord! If you do this for me, I'll try not to sin so much anymore. Please Lord, no questions on the foreign policy of Oliver Cromwell. - Heard Dopey Day's set some trick questions. - Well, those who've done their preparation should have no difficulty. - Well, it'll be back to the post office for some, won't it? I won't say we couldn't see it coming. (chattering) (door squeaks) (door slams) - Ladies, you have exactly 1 1/2 hours. - Well, history is away and running. Hope a few of them get through, or I'll lose my job. Little Miss Rambotham's failure should be my lot. - You might be in for a surprise. Her English paper was excellent. - And she may even pass her French. (snorts) - Mr. Strachey. Mr. Strachey! (paper crinkling) (applauding) - And now, my friends, I should like to draw to your attention a special distinction which the school has achieved. This year for the first time we have won the cultural accolade of the Woodfall Scholarship for musicianship. (applauding) This scholarship, which provides for two years tuition under the famous Professor Heineke in Leipzig, has this year been won by the holder of our College Medal for Literature, Miss Laura Tweedle Rambotham. (applauding) I feel sure that Miss Rambotham would be the first to insist that this honor does not belong to one individual only, but to all who, over the years, have succored and encouraged her, and spurred her on as an instrument of God's holy work. Miss Rambotham will now perform for us all the work which enabled her to gain this outstanding honor. Beethoven's Sonata Number 21 in C Major. (applauding) (coughing) (peaceful piano music) (moves into dramatic music) - The recital was superb. Indeed, Mrs. Rambotham, we are extremely proud of our daughter. A girl with such talent, and, if I may say so, obvious genius-- (maid gasps) Clumsy girl, clumsy! Out of my sight! (whispering) Little mullygrubs, one must keep them in their place! - My dear, dear child I have followed your career with the very deepest interest. Alas, I have been, I am retiring this year, but off you go to Germany, and my best wishes, my very best, yes! - If you write a book about us, Laura, send me a copy. A good cry might do me the world of good. - If you meet any of the nobility in Europe, you will write and tell me all about them, Laura dear? Their castles, their clothes! - Good luck, Laura. - You'll write, won't you? - No more stories now, Tweedledum. - Think of me, Tweedledum, stuck out in the bush. - That gorgeous kid in in the hall's your sister, you'll always be playing second fiddle. - Laura, Laura dear! (lively band music) - Here, Pin. - But you'll get sunstroke, Laura! - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna have a good run!
