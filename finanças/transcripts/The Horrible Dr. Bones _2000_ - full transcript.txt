Write the music and sound, that sort of thing. - Ah, yes, the man behind the curtain. Well, we do have changing facilities, but right now we're more interested in the group's sound. So, and if there is a later, we'll deal with that then. - Oh, there will be. When you hear them, you'll know what I'm talking about. - Well then we'll see about that. - Then, uh, is it okay if I go into the mixing booth? That's were I make my magic. - Of course. - Okay. - You're not gonna let him go in the mixing booth, are you? - For now. It's important that they're comfortable so that they can produce the best sound possible. We'll know if they're the right ones. - We are so happy to be here.

If you come by tomorrow, we'll have papers drawn up. We can talk, I can show you the studio. (eerie ambient music) We got a lot of plans in store for you. And trust me, soon everyone will know who you are. All of you are going to become very, very rich. (clapping) - Ah, damn. You guys can really blow. (laughing) - Maxie White. What are you doing here? - Oh, well, I heard about the audition so I thought I'd come on over and scoop up some of this talent. - These auditions are private. - Chill out, man. I'm just looking. - I would suggest you look elsewhere, Maxie White. - Uh, yeah. Okay. Heh. Look. Sometimes a little competition is healthy. Keeps us on our toes. - Ignore him. He's just a scavenger.

(laughing) - [Lisa] Pookie, what are you doing? - [Pookie] Hey, you'll see. - Hey, hey, guys, guys. Try not to rejoice too much, okay? Until we know exactly what the deal is and what he wants from. - God forbid he would want us to sing and play for a living. I mean, listen, man, we can't be getting any less than what we get right now. - Hey, people. - Ah, that's what I'm talking about, baby. - Look. - That's what I'm talking about.

(laughing) - Yeah. - Yo, man. What's the matter with you, man? This is a dream come true. - Yeah, yo. I mean, we've been playing together since we were in high school. He's right. This is finally a chance for us to make this into something. I mean, you should be happy for us. - I am happy. I mean, is just, seems like is a little too good to be true, you know? I mean, it's just something about that Dr. Bones that I don't trust. He's-- - Hey, well maybe it's the way he looks at our girl Lisa, here. 'Cause maybe, if you were an ice cream cone, you definitely will be licked. - You so nasty. - That's cold, man. That's cold. - Hey, young blood! All right, the Urban Protectors. Woo. You guys sound damn good in there. Now look, I know you guys are planning on doing something with Bones and all, but if that don't pan out, I got a few venues I wouldn't mind having you guys playing. Now, I don't have the capital that Bones has, all the fancy radio stations. But I got a fair deal. And nobody, I mean, nobody has to chase me for a buck. You know what? Take my card. - Wow. - Call me up, even if you guys just wanna talk, I'm cool with that. You know, the problem with young brothers and sisters these days, they don't have people to guide them in that right direction. - Right, right, right. - But you know what I mean. Well, you guys got my number. Use it. - Right. - All right, guys, cool. Fabulous. - Right, peace, man. - [Maxie] All right, call me, now. - All right, bye. - Yo! (laughing) (ominous orchestral music) (choking) - Oh, here you are. Easy, there. - Jesus Christ, but look at him. - You're falling apart, aren't you, Alexander? It's time you retire, my old friend. (breaths heavily) Even in your febile and decayed mind, you still recognize this. (groans) (breaths heavily) Rest in peace. At last. Dispose of him. Alexander was one of my oldest and best. Way of all flesh. - But now they all remain dead. Soon we won't have to traffic with the dead. - You always were, they were reliable, not like your new science. - The world will be yours. Not at the corners of a tomb, but the living flesh. - I pray that you're right, Theodora. (hip hop music) - I need to talk to you about today. About us. - Us? You and me or the group? - Both. ♪ All the rumors get started ♪ - Look, Lisa, I don't think there's much to talk about. We'll find out what the deal is tomorrow, either they want us or they won't. - That's not what I mean. - Look, Lisa, you don't have to do this, okay? I mean, it's obvious that I'm the only one who doesn't think Bones walks on water. - We don't think that he walks on water. We just think that he may have a boat to get us to the other side. - Yeah, yeah. - You know what? You shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. - You know, sometimes a gift horse can be a Trojan horse. - But sometimes there is not a hidden agenda. - Oh, come on, Lisa. Everybody has motivations for the things that they do. - Oh, and there's something wrong with that? - Not if you're straight up and up-front with it. - Oh, and Dr. Bones isn't? - Oh, when it's about you, he is. - Oh. Okay. - Yeah, Lisa, come on. Pookie hit the nail right on the head? It's obvious that the guy wants you. - Yeah, he looks at me. That's right. He looks at me, but then, most guys do look at me. This is a business, right? That's what you said, remember? Right? This is a business. Now, I don't see you asking me to wear a nun's habit when I go up onstage to perform. - Well, that's, that's completely different. - Oh, is it? You know, I don't think so.

You will all be superstars. - We are good, aren't we? - Yeah, enough for that struggling artist bullshit. (laughs) - I know that, Philsie. That's what your grandmother used to call you, wasn't it? Philsie. - Yeah. - She loved you very much. Raised you from a baby. It wasn't her fault that she was just a poor black woman, who had to work three jobs to make ends meet. Keep food on the table. - She worked herself to death. - And the hospital wouldn't accept her. - She couldn't afford the insurance. - If you only had the money at that time, you could have saved her. - Yeah, I know. - You will never lack for anything again.

You design the costumes, of course Lisa gets to wear the sexiest outfit. She gets all the attention. All the applause. But it's been like that always, hasn't it? - Yes. - I can't hear you. - I said, yes. Everybody always wants her. No matter what I do, it's never enough. - Why do you think they want her? - Because I'm not some high young girl who needs to run her fingers through her hair to get attention. - Wanda is beautiful. - Then why is it that none of these so-called brothers want a real sister? I mean, all they want is a chocolate version of a Barbie doll. Oh, the skinny legs, and the tiny waist, and the small behind, you know? Every group out there has some girl frontin' for them. Music? Music doesn't even matter anymore. - It matters to me, Wanda. Your music is crucial to my prize. We will change the world with your music. And with me, you will be featured more, people will know your name. And no more fading into oblivion behind another lead singer, who's only making it because of her looks. I see you. I appreciate you. - You see me? - Yes. I see you for your real beauty. I will never ignore you, or make fun of your hair or your lips like your two sisters used to do. Because you were the darkest. You are a beautiful, young, black, talented woman. - I am? - Yes, of course you are. Isn't she, Pookie? - Oh, yeah, sure. - You wanted to ask Wanda out plenty of times, haven't you? - Oh, yes. - Then why haven't you? - I just haven't. - All women are not like your mother, Pookie. - She used to beat me so much. - Yes. - I mean, for the smallest things, she beat me. Beat me. - Until? - She died. - How did your mother died, Pookie? - She was drunk. She got into me about something. She just went berserk and started wailing on me. Calling me, "No good. "Lazy like your father." She stepped in front of me at the stairs. And she raised her hand to slap me in my face. I never did it before, but this time, I raised my hand to block when she swung to hit me. And she fell down the stairs. She broke her neck. I killed her. - Oh, no, Pookie. You didn't kill your mother, it was an accident. (sobbing) It was an accident. You'll never have to feel ashamed, Pookie. You will have a home here, I, I will be like a father to you. - Where's Jamal? Why isn't he here? - You love him, don't you? - He-- - Go on, say it. - He was my first. - Yes. And the first is the one you never forget. - No. - I like Jamal. And bear no animosity. What has he got against me? - He doesn't trust you, he thinks that you have other motivations. - [Dr. Bones] Motivations? Like what? - He thinks that you want me and that you are not what you seem to be to the eye. - Will that be so bad? If I wanted you? - I don't know. - I'm experienced and I know how to take care of a woman's needs. Your needs. - My needs? - Think about that. This is only a dream, and when you awaken, you won't remember everything, only the important things. Go now, back to your own reality.

I just wanna say that I agree with what you said yesterday about the effects of music on our young people. - [Dr. Bones] Well, thank you, Emma. - [Emma] I think you're right. A lot of parents are falling down on their job with their kids, and blaming music for their own shortcomings. - [Dr. Bones] Absolutely.

I just wanna say that, uh, I know this is a very important meeting, you know, probably one of the most important meetings we've ever had, and I just thought it'd be a good idea if we asked, uh, the man upstairs for a little help. - Hey, that's a good idea. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Heavenly father, we realize that we don't always come to you for help, but God, we know that you promised us that if we come to you in prayer everything will be all right.

He'll be joining you shortly, as soon as he can wrap it up. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. We heard him on the way over. Yeah, it was a good show, about, uh, about the effects of music on young people. - Yeah. - The doctor has some very strong feelings on that. Well, let me give you the grand tour while we're waiting for Doctor Bones, and I can show you where you'll be recording. - Great. - Cool. (chuckles) - Of course you know the dance hall. Not only is it a stage and concert hall, but we use it as a community room for organizations, town meetings and such. We must do our community service and all.

We have four dressing rooms, one for each of you. - What about Jamal? - Oh, I'll probably be in the booth. (chuckles) - Oh. Y'all, this is so tight. - Tight? - Yeah. You know, most of the places we play, we gotta get dressed in the bathroom, or storeroom, ain't that right? (laughing) - [Pookie] You know what I'm saying? - Believe me, those days are over. - Yeah. All right. - This leads to one of our basement areas, which is undergoing extensive renovation. - Oh, you're taking us on the scenic tour, huh? - No doubt, Jamal, you know every inch of your home. Mine is not to be seen walking. - But yours is to or die. - Precisely. Follow me. - Oh, man, this place is huge. - Yes. It's deceptive. When seen from the outside it looks smaller. Most people know about the radio station, but they have no idea about the other ventures the doctor's pursuing here. When this area is fully ready, it'll be used for television broadcasting. - I saw this place in my dreams. - Me too. - What the hell y'all talking about? - Hey, man, this place is amazing.

The effect of media on the minds of the public. Does art imitate life or does life imitate art? - Well, our art influences life. - Ah, yes, but to what degree? You see, we're all responsible for our own actions. - Well the Urban Protectors represent positivity and inspiration. - That's right, that's right, we don't deal with none of that ho, bitch bullshit, you know. That's not who we are. That's not what we do. - [Pookie] Yeah, right. (all laughing) - Hmm.

(eerie ambient music) I want you to take a good look at these. Not only will we record and produce you, we guarantee you airplay. Not to mention planning a major concert campaign. Boys and girls, you will want for nothing. In addition to your signing bonus of $25,000 apiece, (exhales) we are prepared to offer you $100,000 apiece for your three-year commitment with Boneyard Records. We will be committed to you. - What, what about record sales? - You get a percentage of every sale, and a piece of every gate at every concert. It's all very simple and clear in your contracts. - Okay, right here it says that, that you are responsible for the production and technology of the group. So what am I supposed to be doing? - You're part of the group. You'll be included in the deal. We don't wanna cut you out. - That's nice, but that doesn't tell me what I'm supposed to be doing. A'ight? My job is to control the sound. No one knows the sound better than I do. - Jamal, isn't it? We need professionally experienced technicians in the field of audio technology. You see, this is a field that changes every day And we just don't have time to teach you as we go along. - Teach me? - Look, man, come on, man, this is a good deal here. - A damn good deal. Actually, you have no legal position with the band. You're not the manager. - No, no, I'm not, but we've had an agreement for the last eight years. And we're friends. - Theodora, perhaps we should give them a second. After all, this is the stuff that dreams are made of, and you do remember your dreams, don't you? - Look, man, don't mess this up for us. Okay? This is a once in a lifetime thing, all right? - Yeah, he's right. - Yeah, man. - Damn right I'm right. Even the majors, they don't offer this kind of deal to an unknown group. - Yeah, yo. - I just wanna be careful about selling out our music, you know? I love you, guys. - We do too. - And we love you too. But don't mess this up for us, man. Come on, man, it's either you're down or you're not. All right? Now, we want you with us, man. - Come on, man. - Come on. - Okay, we'll do it. - All right. - That's what we're talking about. - Excellent. You won't regret this. There is one thing that I wanna tell you up-front. It's that we're involved with the charity of One World Trust. - Oh, I've heard about them. - We've been approached to do a remote broadcast to promote the fight against world hunger. The broadcast will be live, and it will be worldwide. Now, we took the liberty of telling them that we were signing a new group. The Urban Protectors. (laughs) - We're gonna be featured in the broadcast? Oh, man, that's awesome! - See, I told you, man. That's what I'm talking about. - You did, you did. - I'll tell you what. We're having a little party tomorrow night to celebrate your signing, the upcoming broadcast, and a new faze for Boneyard Records. We've invited a small group of our key investors. And we will be proud if you would agree to play us a set. - You're damn right we would. Hey, that's what we do. Right, y'all? - Yeah. - Well, I guess that's it. - [Phil] All right. All right. - Uh, Theodora, I think they're forgetting something. Your checks. Don't spend it all in one place. - Oh. - Oh, shit. - Ho, ho, ho! Whoo! (light funk music) ♪ Now we ♪ ♪ Do it, baby ♪ - See, he's not the devil. That One World Trust is a good organization. They've saved many people's lives. - I know, I know. You know, it's not about that, you know, or the deal. Lisa, the deal is great. I'd be a fool not to admit that, it's just, it's just that, that every time I look at that dude he just, he just gives me the creeps. Have you ever listened to him? I mean, really listened to him? It's like, it's like he's, he's, he's modulating every word so that everything that's revealed about him is exactly what he wants to be revealed. I know he's hiding something. He's hiding something and it has something to do with our music. - Why do you think that? - Well, I think that because he wants us so bad. - Well, I hate to inform you but he's already got us. You should have seen the bank teller's face when I deposited that check. Ooh, lord! (chuckles) - Yeah, I'll bet. - What about you? - I haven't deposited it yet. - What? What's the matter with you? Do you know what that money could do for us? - Lisa, don't, okay? - Hey, baby. I want us to start a life together. Move in together.

We will mix it together with the unit at the same time, so that no one will know until it's too late. With the crowd tonight we can tell. - Hmm. The ultimate mixture of arcane and modern science.

Hey, mister cook. What's up? - I got your cloak. I just saw Bones. What was he doing in here? - Baby, he owns the place. - Yeah, but he don't own you. - You know, I'm really tired of your paranoid bullshit. You don't own me either, for your information. Now, give me this. Get outta here. Come on. You're getting on my nerves. - Look, man. Either stop that shit, or take it in your room. I'm trying to concentrate here, right? - Yeah, up yours, man. - Up yours? I said stop that shit! - Stop what shit, man? I'm only tapping. - Look, you know what I'm talking about, man. Don't make me put my foot up your fucking ass. - You just said what? - You heard me. - Nigga, I'll break your neck. - What? - Hey, hey, hey! Hold on!

(sobbing) Wanda. Are you all right? - Jamal, I can't, I can't go on. I can't go in there. - Wait, wait. What are you talking about? - There's something wrong, Jamal. There's something really wrong. - Wanda. Wanda? Listen. Listen, listen. Listen. I need you right now, okay? I need you. The group needs you. All right? Now, you're the backbone of this group. You know what? This is just a crazy day. It seems like something's going on with everybody right now. But I'm telling you, when you get on stage and you start playing that music, everything will take care of itself. All right? You trust me? - Yeah. I trust you. - All right? Now, let's tear this roof off the motherfucker, all right? - Yeah. - All right? - Thanks, boo. I mean, it's probably just nerves or something. - Yeah. All right. Okay. (eerie ambient music) - Showtime. (hip hop music) - Okay, okay. How is everybody? - [All] All right. - You fine? All, right, all right. I want you to get on stage and do what you do best. - Yeah! - All right. - Absolutely. I wish you all the very best out there. You see, my job is easy. All I have to do is introduce you and take all the credit. (all laughing) - Thanks. - That's what I'm talking about right here. - Ladies, ladies. Could we, uh, do a little sum sum after the show? You know what I'm saying? (audience applauding) - Ah, yes. Good evening, everybody, and thank you for coming out tonight. This is a very special evening. You folks are considered some of the city's elite, and I'm glad that you're my friends. So party hardy. It's on me. And I can't wait to introduce you to our newest discovery, and they're going to top the charts. Wanda, Phil, Pookie and Lisa, the Urban Protectors!

The same magic that can control the bodies of the dead is been harnessed of sound, to control the minds of the living. Before, though, whenever we tried to mix the chants subliminally with preexisting music, the results were catastrophic. Each test subject died. We finally figured that we had to mix the music live, the chant being performed at the same time the music is performed. Then, and only then will the combination be effective. Music does indeed have an effect on the mental state of the listener. With the addition of the chant, we should have total mind control. - And you're sure these earpieces are gonna protect us? - Yeah, so far. (snarling) ♪ Put a spell on me ♪ (chanting in foreign language) (eerie ambient music) - That's it, that's it. Stop. That's the last number. We gotta get out of here. They're all zombies. I was right about Bones. He's crazy. He just killed Maxie White. Reached, reached right into his, he pulled his heart out! It's got something to do with the music. They're altering it for something evil. - Well, that's a very interesting story, Jamal. Philsie, why don't you tell him how you really feel? - Our group? You don't play shit! All you do is try to fuck things up for us and ride on our coattails. - Yeah. - Don't you see? See, see? It's messing with your head. Look, the only reason why it's not affecting me is because I have this earpiece in. The hum interferes with the signal. - That's stolen property, sir. Lisa, do you think he has any idea of your greater destiny? - Baby, baby, you gotta believe me. We gotta get out of here. - How about that band, ladies and gentlemen, Weren't they terrific? (audience applauding) You see how they love you? You walk off that stage and you'll never walk back on again anywhere. This is just the beginning. In two weeks, your music will be played to the world. Don't you wanna be a part of that? A part of that history? You see, Jamal, it's already too late. Your wallet. For so long I could only control the will of the dead. But now, I control the living! Lisa! Please me! Now! - Lisa, no, no! Let's get out of here! Come on! - Rasha, Tasha. Kill him! Bring the woman back alive. She's my new servant. - This is incredible, man. - Yes, the experiment is a success. Imagine what will happen when we broadcast live all over the world. - Yes. Chaos will reign. There will be a new humankind. - We will rule the world. - Yes. We. Kill them both. (zombies snarling) (screaming) - Lisa, come on! - [Lisa] They're about to get me! (screaming) - Come on, Lisa! Come on! (snarling) (screams) Go! - [Lisa] Oh, my God! Jamal, they're coming! Help me! (snarling) Where are we? What is this freaky shit? (gasping) (screaming) - It's Maxie. (gasping) (sobbing) - What is that? Oh, my God. They're hearts. What's going on, Jamal? - Zombies, they're all zombies. (screams) - My congregation will now get all that changes. This is the day of the living dead. - You must have sold your soul to the devil. (laughs) - Centuries ago. Now, in the new millennium, I will be given the minds of your youth. Soon they will be adults and breed more slaves. - These hearts. These hearts are what keeps them alive. - Oh, not for long. Soon they will be obsolete. My newer zombies will not have to die in order to serve me. Imagine a world of Lisas willing to succumb to my will. They're my children. - Oh, yeah? So what happens if I do this? (Lisa gasps) - What are you doing? No. Stop it! No! Don't! (screaming) No! - Lisa! (glass shattering) (growling) (screaming) (screaming) (moaning) - Move! (grunting) (electricity crackling) (screaming) (Lisa screams) - Uh, that's our show for tonight, folks. Let's get out of here. (dramatic orchestral music) (light guitar music) - And how is that song coming along, Mr. Cook? - Oh, it's coming along fine, Mrs. Cook. (chuckles) How's my baby boy doing? - Oh, he's doing okay. (chuckles) (doorbell rings) Oh, let me get that. - All right. (light guitar music) - Isn't this wild? - Who is it from? - I don't know. - Well. - What you got in there? - Well, let's see what it is. - Hurry up, honey. - All right. There we go.
