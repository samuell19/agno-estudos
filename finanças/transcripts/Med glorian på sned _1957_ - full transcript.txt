Your Halo is Slipping Book Publishers Mrs Lovgren "The Impotence of Modesty" A novel - Good evening. - Good evening, sir! - Looking good. - Yes. But then it's Saturday. That shipowner, Englund, was asking for you. He's over there. I hope everything is to your satisfaction. Hey! Where the hell have you been hiding? I have other restaurants to look after. You take on too much. Better to have one very good restaurant than 3 average ones! Just ignore him! Yngve's in a complaining mood. There's a stevedore strike in Rio. - Anything wrong with the food? - No... it was excellent. But apart from that... That violinist of yours... What's it matter if he played a wrong note?! Just because he's good-looking... You should have heard his Grieg... enough to give you goose-pimples! Have you finished ordering? Just sitting, waiting for coffee. Alright... see you. Mr Lovgren! I want to speak to you for a moment... I'll be in my office. What if he gets fired now, because of you. If it's anyone's fault, it's his own. He might have a wife and kids. Well, he shouldn't have a job flirting with the female guests. - You're jealous! - Don't be stupid! That's alright... I think that's very sweet of you! Come in! - Sit down, Mr Lovgren. - Thank you. I'll get straight to the point... I've had complaints. Yes, about your playing. It's not the first time. I know you're a first-class musician. You once were a rising star. I know why you never lived up to the expectations placed upon you. You have to appreciate... You've played here for 4 years. You're a part of our image. You're an asset to the restaurant, a great asset. Women come here largely because of you, rather than the food. You're much too kind. I suggest you cut the sarcasm. I'm sorry... it wasn't intended. I'm aware of your merits... but also your faults. I've had enough of them. Either pull up your socks, or I'll have to dispense with you. Understood? I'll make sure there are no more complaints, sir. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mr Lovgren. - Do you love me? - Of course I do. - But what about your wife? - Don't talk about her. If I can forget her, so can you. Can you, though? I can, here with you. You're really quite terrible! I can't help it... I was born that way! You should never have married. You're not the right type.. like me. No, I shouldn't have. It was Birgitta who wanted to... She IS the type. She wanted to take care of me... She saw it as her mission in life. If only women didn't have such misguided ambitions! It'd make things easier. You talk too much. So shut me up! Sixten... wake up! It's 10 o'clock. Coffee's ready. Here's your dressing gown. It's a beautiful day! Don't go back to sleep! I'll get up. You were late last night. I stayed awake till 1, then I fell asleep. It was a long night. There was a function in the banquet room, and they wanted us to play. I didn't want to, but it meant extra money for the guys. I did it for them. I understand. On the subject of money... No money talk this early! You know that. There are things to pay tomorrow. Do you want an egg. Good heavens, no! You eat too little in the morning. Not at all... You know I eat in the evenings. What did YOU do yesterday? I had some things to do in the office. You get paid extra for that, don't you? It's nothing to make a fuss about. I'm paid well enough. You can't work for nothing! You should be paid extra. You can't work overtime for nothing. Maybe I can talk to Dahlander. Please forget it. You tend to your job... I'll tend to mine. I was only trying to help. That's nice of you but it's not necessary. How about we go out to Strangnas for Sunday lunch? No, I can't. I've got a recording session at 2 o'clock. What a shame. When we were newlyweds, we always used to go somewhere. Remember? Newlyweds... Sound quite strange now... So long ago. Now we sit with the paper between us... ...like every other boring couple. She talks, and he says "Mm mm"! Did you hear anything I said? It's dangerous to shut your love up with these two enemies... ...time and habit. Habit kills love. That's silly. A third of Swedes have had a car for 20 years. It says that here. Where would they go with it? That's true. - I'm going to Strangnas. - Hop in! So am I. - What are you doing in Strangnas? - My girl lives there. That sounds so nice! Not chick, bird, broad, or babe... Just "girl"! Is she pretty? Well, I think so! Have you ever been in love? Yes, more than once. It's the first time for me. I really went overboard. I get so I can't breathe... And keep getting tears in my eyes for no reason. Does that mean I'm really in love? Yes, that'd mean you were really in love. Then one day it's all over. Is it? Doesn't it always end? No, I don't think so. Not if it's really true love! Thanks for the lift. Thanks for the company... My regards to your girl. Dahlander and Son... no, Mr Dahlander won't be in till about 10. - Hi... anything happening? - I split with Charlie yesterday. Not again?! Why? He called me a bubble-head. Here's the cover for "Frosty Nights". - Why did he say that? - I bought a pink hat for 65 kr. Really cute. With white flowers. I thought it made me look pretty. All I got was "bubble-head". It's him! - Is the boss in? - No. Remind him about "Courtyard Under the Elms". There's only 300 left. If he wants a reprint, I'll have to tell the printers today. I'll tell him. Did you call me "bubble-head" or not? It's nothing to do with anything?! I haven't got time for private calls. Goodbye! He's softening up! Why don't you just get married? Don't be silly... with joint taxation? And what would he call me then?! "Darling" for example. I know men who say "darling". Darling this and darling that! "Darling... do we have to listen to the radio?" "Darling... I hate soft-boiled eggs." They say "darling" when they're irritated. Please don't be mad, darling! You aren't a bubble-head and the hat was pretty! It's best I tell you this now... I don't want to be called "darling"! I thought that would be nice. No, I don't think... Oh, good morning Mr Dahlander! - Was that Charlie? - Yes, it was. It's all off again. What shall we do with Miss Svensson and Charlie? They've been at it day and night for 3 years! Any messages? A gent rang who's coming in. Let's do the mail, Mrs Lovgren. Kronstrand wants a decision for a reprint of "Courtyard Under the Elms". There's 300 left. Do 2,000. 500 hard-cover. Ask Mr Liljeroth to come in. Here's the cover for "Frosty Night". No... doesn't grab me... What do you think? You'd have to agree it's artistic. Maybe so... But it won't sell at all. "Frosty Nights" is such a dreadful title. Makes me think of long winter underwear. - We should change it. - Sjolander would go nuts. Yes... When he sees how badly it sells. Now it's Charlie again! Miss Svensson... Get me Torben Sjolander. You wanted me, sir? Book a 15 x 2 ad for "Courtyard". A review quote, but no picture of the bitch. She looks terrible. Am I interrupting? Here are the numbers for "Sea Breeze"... 4,000 1st edition. Hi... Torben! I'm calling about the title... We really have to change it. Yes, I'm sure. Nobody wants to read about frosty nights. I appreciate it's symbolic... but that doesn't make it any more inviting. Don't be so goddamned stubborn!... Remember how it went with "Cross-Draught"... Nobody wants to read wearing mittens. Goddamned authors! Any of you got a suggestion? I haven't read it. "Dying Fire" "Sunset". No. Too much like Hauptmann. "Lost Voyage"... that's not bad! At least we've got off the climate. We'll go with that. We'll send you a proof next week. We'll submit that back to Soderberg. New title... "Lost Voyage". I'll check these figures. See me after lunch. And about that ad... Just run it in the 'Dagens Nyheter'. What's this then? Looks like a manuscript. Give it to Elving. His vacation starts today. So it does. "Enclosed please find manuscript of the novel "The Impotence of Modesty". "For personal reasons I would not want book published under my name..." ..."except under the name 'Eurydice' or other fictitious name." "Regarding remuneration, I accept industry standards." Nice of her! "I may accept deletions, but I will object to any rewriting." Exactly! "If the book is accepted, payment should be made to the account of "Modesty". "Yours sincerely. Eurydice." Certainly a woman, and certainly trash. Don't say that. It just might be good. In my 16 years here, I've only ever had one manuscript like that, that was any good. This could be the second one! Ask him to wait. What did you say Miss Svensson? Speak up... I can't hear you! Drunk? I'll let you know as soon as I'm free. "The Impotence of Modesty"... Is that from Shakespeare? Remember Hamlet's scene with Ophelia... ...where he compares the power of modesty... not the impotence, with the power of beauty. You sound like my teacher, Hagvall. He was HagLUND! Wrong again! If I didn't have you, I'd have to shut up shop. "The Impotence of Modesty"... catchy title! But the pseudonym suggests a twit of a woman. Eurydice was married to Orpheus, wasn't she? Don't tell me I'm wrong a again or I'll never be able to say anything! You were right that time! Elving can read it when he gets back. That's 3 weeks away. It's probably junk anyway. What if it's not? It may be something for autumn. Can't you have a read of it? No, I'm out for dinner today. Shall I give it to Broberg? He hasn't read anything newer than Sjoderberg or Bellman. He calls modern literature "bubble-and-squeak with a hard-boiled egg". So what shall we do with it? Read it yourself... I bet you'll give up after 20 minutes. Enjoy yourself! I have someone waiting for me. Please... Mr Dahlander! You're the one who wanted it read! Not me. I'm not the person to judge it. You most certainly are! Tell me tomorrow what you think. Send him in. Off you go! Hello there! You can go in now! Good morning... Anton's the name. Karl Anton. Dahlander. I'm actually a painter, but sometimes I amuse myself with a bit of verse. When I'm not drunk, that is. At times I let these two diverse pursuits... ...combine into a higher unity. The result is not only gratifying... ...but also quite surprising, not least for myself. I've called this little collection "The Bloody Giraffe". Let me have a look... I know what I know... I can't take criticism! I can go berserk if I meet resistance. Then the little white lamb must face a bloodstained dragon! I'll read a bit... the title poem... Hang on to that! "The Bloody Giraffe"... Here it is... "The bloody giraffe knows no bounds..." "Slowly seeking, but relentless..." What's this say? ...relentless is his walk between enigmas... "...harder to free than locks from Apollo's head..." Hot stuff, eh? "His eyes are shut as tight as mussels in the sea..." "Yet he sees more than million nebulae." Hey... you're home! I was a bit late as had to pay some bills. What are you reading? This came from your office... You'd forgotten it. What a terrible pen-name! This is nothing to do with you at all! How would you feel about someone poking into your attempts at composition? Are you in a bad mood? No, not at all. But if we get an anonymous manuscript, we can't let just anyone read it. Am I just anyone, suddenly? Not for me... for the company. What are you drinking? Scotch and soda. At this hour? Darling... a little whisky doesn't hurt. Don't say "darling" in that tone! You should hear yours. Sorry... it's been a day of rushing and queuing... Impossible to park. Did you make the payment on the car? Damn! I forgot. You're impossible! It won't hurt if I do it tomorrow. You might have put the potatoes on. I didn't know if we had any. There's a bagful here in the pantry. I was thinking... How about you quit publishing, and just be a housewife. It's too much for you as it is. We can live on what I make. We just get by now. And I enjoy being a secretary. I'd get sick to death of being home all the time. What about part time? Dahlander would never agree. What about another company? I don't want to change. I like it there. As Dahlander's secretary. Of course. He's more important to you than I am. Sixten, don't start on that tack. You just said you wanted me to stop working for my own sake, not yours. Let's stop arguing... You can set the table. If we eat quickly I'll have time to wash the dishes before I go to work. What if you stopped working at the tavern and joined an orchestra? We'd get free evenings then. There's no way I'd do that. You see! We're both professionals and we stay where we are. Go and set the table! - How is it with Charlie? - We've made up again. Does it never gets boring with the constant ruptures and reunions? No... it's nice... It's like driving over hills and dales. It makes you giddy going up and down. Marriage is just like drifting around in the Tunnel of Love. That's a very cynical take on marriage. And you undervalue marriage's possibilities to be mind-blowing! Tell Mrs Lovgren I'm here. Good morning. There are letters here for you to sign. Gyllendahls Publishing... Torneman's contract. The "no thanks" to Baroness von Liewen's memoire. That was terrible. And the Moheda paper mill. It says what you'd want to say. Or you... which is just as good. Yes... That can stay just as it is. Did you get that manuscript yesterday? You forgot it, so I sent a messenger boy. Yes I got it. Was it garbage? It's no literary masterpiece... ...but it had a certain realism that made it engaging. What was it about? About a marriage that breaks down. The wife falls in love with another man and dreams about him. Not exactly original. Maybe not, but... How many plots are? That's true enough. What happens then? Actually, nothing really. Neither the husband nor the other man find out about her love. Come off it...! That doesn't fill a few hundred pages. Readers want something to happen. Sex... snowstorms... Something has to happen! People are tired of inner conflicts. They went out with the 40s. It's a delightful small-town portrait... full of crazy characters. - So you're saying I should publish it? - Yes. We don't have much else. But this "Paris by Night" is an embarrassment for the firm. What would your father have said about that cover? He would have said "yummy"! He never would have published it. Ask Broberg to see me. Would it be suitable for a book club? Yes, it's obviously written for women. What are the men like in the book? The husband's a bit weak, but underneath, he's nice... a good person. Sounds boring. The other man is a go-getter, wrapped in his work. For him, women are just for recreation. That sounds dull, too. You wanted to see me? We're putting out "The Impotence of Modesty". Mrs Lovgren likes it. You can't publish it only on my recommendation. I won't take responsibility. Don't be silly... It's just a novel for women... I trust you implicitly. I'm telling I won't take the responsibility... I'm employed as a secretary, not as a literary adviser. Just a moment, I'll fetch the manuscript. You wouldn't read it would you? No. No more cheap novels for me! I got Elving's short version of that prizewinning book. It's down 200 pages to 650. 650 pages on an Assyrian queen! It cost us 10,000 at least. We've no best-seller for autumn. We say that every summer. Yet always finish with 1 or 2 at the top for Christmas. - Here you are. - Is this really necessary? Yes it is. I'll give you an answer in the morning. Here are the first copies of "In the Wilds of Africa"... The cover will sell them! It's a cock-and-bull story! Want one? I hate jungle books! I'd rather read a cookbook. Mrs Lovgren... like one? Take "Paris by Night" Maybe your husband would like it. Cock-and-bull story... Cock-and-bull story... John... Stop drinking! I beg of you! Palm wine never hurt anyone. Go to sleep instead of nagging. John, I cannot sleep. I shall sit a while by the fire. That Swedish major is enticing! Do not be silly, John. I am a modest housewife. We both know that. Oh, those crazy, reckless fireflies! Oh, those crazy, reckless lions! What are you reading, major? The manuscript you gave me. What do you think of it? Oh, no! You see, Lady Margareta, you're no author... You're a woman. Let that be enough for you... I love you... Don't you realise that? You mustn't say that, Major Dahlander! Yes! and you love me... I know! I saw it in your eyes, that time I carried you across the Jango River. Now I will get revenge! I've known this the whole time! John! Drop the gun! You're not sober. Sober enough to hit YOU! Take my word, if you kill me, you'll never get home. Isn't that too bad! Can't be helped. Stand still! Sixten, is that you? Of course... what's up? I had a dreadful nightmare. You killed me... Shot me, in the jungle! Why'd I do that? I don't know... what time is it? 3.15... I played poker at Kurre's place afterwards. Do you often dream I kill you? No, thank goodness. It was that ridiculous Africa book I started reading yesterday. I dreamt you were "Sir John" and I was "Lady Margaret". And we shot water buffaloes. So there was just you and me? No, there were natives as well. Come to bed and sleep now, or I'll be dead in the morning. Good morning, Mrs Lovgren! I have to say I'm very disappointed in you! Have you read the book? Yes I have. And thrown it in the fire? Thrown it in the fire?! You said yesterday that there was a certain realism to the book... ...even if it wasn't a masterpiece. Something like that. - And you really believe that?! - Yes. Good. I'm just fooling with you. I was reading it till 2.30 this morning. A delightful book! It's no stylistic masterpiece... the way it's arranged. But it's full of humanity and charm. Oh thank you Mr Dahlander!... What for? For thinking the same as me, I mean. - Have you ever been in Strangnas? - No! I thought we should go there. To do what? Hunt down Eurydice. In Strangnas? Why Strangnas? The manuscript was sent from there. Can you come in the morning? Yes... but I don't think it's a very good idea. Just because it was POSTED there, doesn't mean she LIVES there. She may have taken it there to preserve her anonymity. But I'm quite sure she lives there. The depiction of small-town life fits Strangnas. There are lots of Swedish towns like that. I'm sure it'd be hopeless. I don't care. I want to find her, and we have to start somewhere. Why do you want to find her? Just book 2 rooms at the best hotel. I'll pick you up at 10. Bring clothes for a week. I won't be back today... I've things to do in town. See you! So it's just you and him going... ...just to look for this authoress? What sort of person calls themself Eurydice? What's it matter what her name sounds like? So you're away for a week. - That's what he said. - What he said!? And you just agree. I AM his secretary! If he said "We're going to Hawaii for 6 months", would you go along? - And do a hula-hula dance for him! - Don't be silly. So whereabouts is YOUR work boundary? Is it Copenhagen, or Paris, or the equator? Sixten... Don't you trust me? There's trust and trust. "Opportunity makes the thief," they say. Anyone can have their weak moments. Are you speaking from experience? That would be strange. So now you throw it at ME! I'm not off to Strangnas with some bimbo. When I'm in bed at 4 or 5 in the morning when you come home, I'm not feeling jealous. Because I trust you. That's ONE explanation. So what's another one? That you don't give a damn what I do. That would explain a lot. I won't go, if you don't want me to. No, you go. I have to go to work. I'll be late. Get a good night's sleep. It'd so yummy! It's so yummy! I am a disguised, rather weak and deluded Eurydice... Eurydice... Place Pigalle and Chapelle after 10 every night, is my domain... ...is my domain... A skirt that is tight and a boa of a fox... Eurydice Eurydice Sway your hips from the waist, so the guys can all see... Eurydice Eurydice I Greece there one time, Orpheus played a song... "Eurydice" Eurydice Now naught but whistles are heard, harp strings are not stirred... ...when Eurydice wanders by... Modesty was once my aim in life... Greek fashion determined my hemline... Only room for one man in my chaste abode... Evergreen virtue was my constant companion... Sin was to me something quite unfamiliar... But one day I slipped and now I do the same... But I'll only go down for dough! Ha-ha! Why don't you get a divorce? I need to find the right moment. You don't want to, that's all. That's not it. When you've been married 6 years it's not easy. God you're weak! You're like an old woman... ...who knows she should have an operation, but would rather live with her pain. But you're strong! Thank God... I am! And ruthless. I divorced a man who deceived me. I had proof! I don't believe Birgitta's deceiving me. - I'd need proof. - So get some. I searched my husband's office when he was away... I found a letter from a Swedish model in Paris. Your wife may have a diary. She sounds like she might be the type. I'm sorry. I slept in. I slept badly last night. - Bad dreams? - Something like that. Probably something you ate. No, read... "Paris by Night". Paris is such a wonderful city. "The Unconscious Ego" by Gottfried Schneider... Is it a novel? Popular-science psychiatry. There's a pile of books in the back. Can we be a bit less formal out of the office. - I'm Per-Axel. - Birgitta. So tell me... Why are you so hell-bent on finding this Eurydice? Mostly out of curiosity. What do you think she's like. I'm not sure... Blonde, ethereal and rather enigmatic. Good heavens! What's wrong with that? Karin's secret love... the surgeon... How do you see him? - An insufferable type. - You think so? Why? You have to admit... It's pretty crazy that he's never aware that Karin's in love with him. Guys aren't so intuitive... and he's so wrapped in his work. He's an idiot... with such a charming woman by his side day after day. But she's married. Feelings don't take that into account. Her feelings do. That's one of the reasons I want to find her. She has to rewrite the ending. Absolutely not! Think about it... It's wrong psychologically. It won't be accepted. Nobody goes for a heroine wearing a halo. It has to slip a bit, occasionally. Dahlander and Son... Mr Dahlander is away... He left no address. In a week... I'll take the message. A typewriter that's been repaired. It's Mrs Lovgren's. The door opposite the entrance. Put it in there, thanks. A typewriter for here. Put it over there. No, not with de Sica. He's so old! You can forget about Sophia Loren! I'm leaving now... Shut the outer door. What did you say? I'm not at all jealous of her figure. If you think so, we can stop seeing each other. Yes. When you say it like that. What? The park? Alright, we'll do that. 7.15... OK. 'Bye. "The Impotence of Modesty" A novel by Eurydice, alias Birgitta Lovgren Hello... thanks again for the other day! Don't mention it. It was nothing. Who was that? It was a boy who'd applied for a job with us. Could I have a cigarette? Of course... I'm sorry. So what happened then? With what? The boy who was looking for a job. Him? I asked my husband to put in a good word for him where HE works... He got a job there instead. Of the company? No, instead of publishing. What does your husband actually do? I know absolutely everything about Miss Svensson's Charlie. Not a clue about yours. My husband's with Radio Sweden. News? No, in the entertainment department. Look at that woman in the flowered dress... - Maybe she's Eurydice. - No... she couldn't be! What about the one in glasses? No... Even less likely. Let's forget Eurydice tonight and focus on each other. How about a dance? I'm out of practice. My steps are early '40s! What do you think? I'd prefer it to be spicier. I'm being sent up in it! You're sure no hero! She's in love with Dahlander... She's Karin and Dahlander's the doctor. All so modest. Maybe not so modest now. She's written to get rid of her frustrations. Maybe she's doing that better by going off with him. Do you think... My dear Sixten, the character doesn't reveal everything! If she's been in love with him for 2 years, do you think nothing will happen? In the present circumstances. On the other hand, how interested is he? Every guy is always interested. If the girl is willing and not too ugly. And I can do nothing... except swallow the bitter pill. Let HER swallow the bitter pill! How do you mean? There is a way. It's almost too exquisite... But there really is a way! - Hello! - So there you are! So how are you? Great. It must have been 22 in the water. In the water? I thought you were at the hospital. Yes... I was there for a few hours... talking with a lot of possible people. Then I went for a dip at the beach. And your investigation? Not a trace... None of the nurses were married to a musician or had literary ambitions. Has anyone taken your order, Mr Dahlander? Not yet... would you like a sherry? - Yes thanks! - 2 dry sherries. Can I offer you a cognac with coffee. I have a bottle of Napoleon left. 1897... It's for celebrity guests. That's terribly kind of you! Are those local musicians who play so well in the evenings? They're from Stockholm. Nice to know you like them! "Madame and Her Dolls"... What's that? Madame Tussaud's waxworks. Well we've done the hospitals and musicians. What shall we try next? We might as well go home don't you think? It's so nice here! Don't you think? - Yes, but... - We decided on a week. I need at least that, to get my samba halfway decent. Tomorrow we can drive to Mariefred, and Saturday have a look at Gripsholm Castle. Didn't Eric XIV eat pea soup there? There it is on the menu. - Pea soup and warm punch. - In this heat? Yuk! It's delicious! At the time, yes... but afterwards! I hate to think. Madame Tussaud's Waxworks. Wax women... Welcome to our circle, madame! Thank you, sire! You're tired, after being boxed up... Have a glass of brandy. - It's my own brand. - Thank you sire! - That feel better? - Much better. Have you come from far away? From Greece. My name is Eurydice. There's that damned Swedish singer with the lute again. Erik... if you must sing, give us something happier! I'm insane and surrounded by bad wax figures, I can only be bleak. I long for little Karin. Nurse Karin, you mean. Play a samba for Napoleon! So he means more to you than I do! You've been drinking, Erik! Hot punch, yes...My God, it was delicious! Let's me forget little Karin's betrayal. She's such a modest girl. Come on Erik! Play now, or I won't give you any cognac. Birgitta... wake up! Sire... I can't take any more! Birgitta... It's just me... Per-Axel! Good heavens! I heard you screaming in your sleep! I had such a crazy dream. You poor thing! You're very sweet. Thank you. Most attractive. Thank you. And very married. Good night. Sleep tight. You too. For the last time... Did you go home with her or not? It makes a hell of a difference! That was all I wanted to know. Goddamned men! - Did you find her? - Who? That woman author of course! Broberg told Liljeroth... So now all of Stockholm knows. How was Per-Axel? Did he make any overtures? No! How could you think that?! It would have been pretty normal. Good morning P-A... and welcome back! Thank you, Miss Svensson! Good morning, Mrs Lovgren! Good morning, Mr Dahlander. Your mail's ready. I said "Mrs Lovgren" to avoid misunderstanding. Miss Svensson jumps to conclusions. We should stay with that in the office. I felt lonely having my morning coffee. That was funny... I mean a shame. I guess your husband was glad to see you. Yes, he was. Who did you say?! Know who's here? Eurydice! What?! Have her come in. You stay here. Good morning, Mr Dahlander... My name is Mrs Alm. I sent in a manuscript. Please take a seat. My secretary, Mrs Lovgren. Good morning. So you don't want to be anonymous any longer. I'm so glad! I thought it seemed silly. Sooner or later the truth will come out. Have you read the book? Yes. And I like the book and it's author. Are you Nurse Karin? Yes and no! Where did you send the manuscript from? From Strangnas. But you don't live there? I posted it from there to throw you off the track. Silly thing to do. Can you prove you're Eurydice? Please! Mrs Lovgren! You're secretary is quite right. One shouldn't be so trusting as you and I, Mr Dahlander. I took the precaution of bringing the original manuscript. So are you happy now, Mrs Lovgren? Of course. Excuse me a moment... I'll be right back. Energetic young lady... concerned for the firm. Yes... too much so, sometimes. There was no detour? The floozy lives in Gubbangen! Yes I know. She's my cousin's best friend. Were you here the whole time I was away? Yes... what's happened? Something has disappeared from my office. It was locked in my desk drawer. Have any strangers been here? One doesn't always know exactly. I may be away from here for a few minutes. Charlie might ring and distract me. The outside door's left open. Was it valuable? In a way. Don't mention this to anybody. Yes, there's one other thing... - I'd like you to change the ending. - Absolutely not! I know every author thinks that way, but it'd really help your book. - Mr Dahlander, I can't do it! - No... that I can well believe. Please! Mrs Lovgren! We can do without that! Draw up a contract for "The Impotence of Modesty". 3,000 kr for the first 2,000... 16.6 percent for the rest. Now about the ending, Mrs Alm... If you think the book needs changing, then I won't try and stop you... But I'm not the one to do it. So if I find someone else... I'm not really happy about it... but if they're talented... ...and don't spoil the literary quality, then I'll go along. Thank you, Mrs Alm! You alright? You seem troubled. No, it's nothing in particular. You've been acting odd since you came home from Strangnas. Did Dahlander stop being friendly? Do you have to keep on about HIM? I saw him at the restaurant yesterday, with a disgustingly good-looking girl. What's that got to do with me? Ooh! What's up? Are you jealous? What about you? I'm hardly through the door, before you start talking about him. Just a moment. I've rewritten the ending to "The Impotence of Modesty". Can you take dictation? You'd need to come over to my place. It'll take a few hours. I don't have a shorthand pad at home. Alright, I can be there in 15 minutes. Can't he do without you any longer? Stop it! You're ruining everything between you and me. Can I drive you down? No thanks, I'll walk. If you wish. "Kristoffersson stood at the station and waited for her." Full stop. "When she approached him, she said"... colon... new line... Open quote... "I am free now." Full stop. "His eyes were full of joy, and he didn't smile"... Full stop. Shouldn't it be "BUT he didn't smile"? No... Hemingway would have used "and". I don't agree! What's Hemingway to do with it? Don't argue... Just do as I say. So... "AND he didn't smile"... Full stop. New line. "He grasped her arm and they boarded the train". Full stop. And that's where it ends. What do you think? Shall I say what I think? You're against it. From a literary point of view, it's alright. But why change it? In terms of content... It's a damned sight better than the first ending. Vera Alm agreed. The new love scenes were among the most intense she read. Is it necessary to explain everything, page after page? You might as well ask if it's necessary to write novels. It's not a question of WHAT is written, but HOW it's done. Where Karin is a cowardly air-head and the doctor a wet blanket! Did you say "cowardly air-head"? You wet blanket! Why call ME a wet blanket? I put more emotion into the book. Can I have a few days off? Yes, but give me a clean copy of this first. Alright. Goodnight! Birgitta... Yes? You and I shouldn't fall out over this book. After all... it's nothing to do with us. That's true... I was silly to lose my temper. I'm sorry... Good night! - Per-Axel... - Yes? No... it was nothing. Operation Birgitta... Nurse Svensson... Set up small operation ladder! Wake up Mrs Lovgren! What are you going to do to me, doctor? Just a small operation, Mrs Lovgren. Operation?! Tell me the truth, Dr Kristoffersson! As you wish... an amputation. I intend to remove your ending. You can't do that... I want to keep my ending as it is! I know how you feel. But you must respect my professional experience. Let me have my way, and you'll be a best-seller! Dr Sixten... don't drink the ether... We need it for the anaesthetic. - I can play her to sleep. - That's a good idea. - Dr Alm... are the dashes ready? - We're out of dashes. We hung quotation marks on them. That's no good, but it'll have to do. - Let me go! - Impossible, Mrs Lovgren! Nurse Svensson... start the typewriter! I think I'll use a new method. I'll cross out your ending! Play louder, Dr Sixten, louder! Yes, my little girl... You've got yourself in quite a muddle! Yes... haven't I! What can I do, Grandpa?... You're old and wise! What you should do is... Why did you write this calamitous book? I don't know. I thought it'd be fun... with a bit of self-assertion. Working off frustrations. No... working off frustrations won't do. Then you wouldn't have made Karin as inhumanly modest as you. No... I have another theory... It's not unusual at the scene of a crime... ...that you find a clue from the criminal... A dropped button... a cap... a glove... Sometimes the burglar goes to the fridge and eats or drinks something. He does the same thing after every crime. Certain psychiatrists say he leaves a clue on purpose. On purpose? Yes... But naturally, he's not doing it consciously. It's the work of his subconscious. Do you know why? So he'll be caught and be able to atone for his guilt. Maybe that sounds far-fetched... but there can be something to it. What's that to do with me? Your book... it's the same thing. The book is the clue... the dropped button, cap, glove... You've written it so somehow you'll eventually be revealed... ...and you'll atone for your guilt... for mentally deceiving your husband... ...a guilt which you wouldn't be able to cope with in the long term. That may be... But it doesn't solve either my literary or personal problem. What would you do in my situation? It's obvious that it's Dahlander whom you love. Yes, I probably do. But I can't just leave Sixten, Grandpa! You have to realise he needs me. Are you quite sure of that? Perhaps he'd be happier with another woman... If I were you, I'd bite the bullet and go for it. There'd just be scandal and pain for me and others. What would people say? I'd be seen as inconsiderate... and cheap... ...sacrificing myself, my husband, my love... ...for an unknown future. No, Grandpa... I can't do that. I know that. In every bookshop today... Vera Alm's debut novel "The Impotence of Modesty" In a modest way... "The Impotence of Modesty" is a literary event. For the ads we'll use "A Swedish literary event." Send roses to Mrs Alm. I'll ring and congratulate her later. D.N. isn't so enthusiastic. This is what it says. "Whatever happened to the author in the last fifth of the book?" "After showing tender-hearted everyday feelings, she loses her inhibitions." "The love scenes show not only reckless disclosure"... ..."but are shocking and obnoxious. What a shame!" That's brilliant... That'll sell 5,000 more. Quote "shocking" in the ad... and "reckless disclosure"... - How big is the 1st edition? - 3,100. Do 6,000 more. That'll be 9,100. Announce it as 10,000. "Shocking! Ruthless exposure of human lust" D.N. 15th thousand Sixten.... Can I have a word? If you play as badly tomorrow as you did today, you're out of this orchestra. That's all. We listen now to Vera Alm... ...who tells something of her first novel "The Impotence of Modesty". I started writing "The Impotence of Modesty"... ...because I had a kind of need to let the people of my childhood... ...Is that a live broadcast? - Yes... from Studio 5. I never thought my story would gain so much attention... The main reason for writing was that it became a vital necessity... ...to let the book's main character, Nurse Karin Ekdal... ...help me clarify my own problems and conflicts. "The Impotence of Modesty" has no hidden meanings... ...but is full of reality... The character who dominates the first quarter of the book... Don't believe anything she says! My wife wrote "The Impotence of Modesty"... I stole the manuscript. - "The Express" wants to talk to you. - All right. Speaking. I've no idea. I tried to find her last night. She's disappeared. I'm convinced... I believe her husband told the truth. Ulricehamn is a small town. Her grandfather was the district doctor. Maybe why she's up on the hospital milieu. The husband in the book is a restaurant musician. I've no idea who the doctor is. Me?! No... absolutely not! Certainly. It won't be 30,000, it'll be 60,000! We'll see. I must get hold of her! I've been a total idiot! Who? Have him come in. Her husband's out there. Best you leave us alone. Good morning, Mr Dahlander. Good morning Mr Lovgren... Thanks for the free advertising. I can hardly say "Don't mention it, it was nothing." I'd hoped to find Birgitta here. No... I've been trying to find her myself. She's sure to be at her grandfather's. I... I actually came to apologise. You've no reason to have a guilty conscience on MY account. I myself have had some responsibility for the situation, though I didn't realise it. You must believe me. We never should have married... She should have married a quite different type. And I should never have married at all. So what has happened was for the best. Maybe it could have been a bit less dramatic. That was all I wished to say to you. Goodbye, Mr Dahlander. Goodbye and good luck! Thanks... the same to you! Well, Vera Alm has confessed. Poor old Sixten! A gentleman to see you, Doctor... Mr Dahlander... a publisher. For God's sake don't say I'm here... I don't want to see him! I understand... I'll get rid of him. Show Mr Dahlander in, Hulda. - You may go in, Mr Dahlander. - Thank you. Hello, Dr Petreus! I'm looking for my secretary, Mrs Lovgren. She's not here. It's some months since she last visited. You've read what happened. Not a very savoury story. You seem very eager to get hold of her... ...is it in her identity as a secretary or an author? Neither of those... I'm... in love with her. That must have happened suddenly. Not really... In fact, I've been that way since I read her novel. I have to find her. She's probably left the country to escape the scandal. Poor girl! Must be hard for her. - To where, do you think? - No idea. She's said that she likes Paris. Might she be there? That's very possible. I shan't bother you any longer. If you come in contact with her, please tell her what I've said... That I truly love her. I really mean it. That will be passed on. Were you thinking of going to Paris? That can be worth a try. I shan't give up looking. "The Impotence of Modesty" A novel by Birgitta Lovgren 40th thousand Dahlander and Son... No!.. hello! How are you? No. I understand... You can rely on me! He'll be back today, I think, on the morning plane... Yes... 'Bye! Guess who just rang... Welcome home, Mr Dahlander. - The ads look good. - Glad you liked them. We can print another run of "Modesty" and "Courtyard" before Christmas. I have some suggestions. - Anything new? - No. Just the usual. Charlie and I have taken out a licence. Congratulations! How did it happen? He locked me in the pantry and wouldn't let me out until I said yes. I never realised for a moment that Charlie could be so brutal! Mrs Lovgren... heard anything? Mrs Lovgren? Oh, THAT Mrs Lovgren! No. Not a whisper. Is Broberg in? No... that's alright... I'll phone him. Hi! I'm back. Thanks. Nothing more. Can you do something for me... ...an ad for a private secretary... You know what I need. No, it's obvious I have to have somebody. Thanks for that. Must she be blonde, ethereal and rather enigmatic? Otherwise, I'm available. When she approached him, she said... "I am free now." Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
