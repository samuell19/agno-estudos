Further on. The experiments using cutaneous tuberculosis, Dr. Heissmeyer, show no improvement to the lungs, only a deterioration. The subjects were no good. Starved, ill. Russians, Polacks. I still need children for my work. And animals. I'll contact colleagues in Auschwitz to supply the material. That won't be a problem. I'll get in touch with Dr. Mengele. What do you need? Ten boys and ten girls. BASED ON A TRUE STORY NORTHERN GERMANY AFTER THE END OF THE WAR Come here. So you're here. May I introduce you, Rudolf öss, Commandant of Auschwitz. Get out! BRITISH MILITARY CAMP What's your name? Franz Lang. My name is Franz Lang. You are Rudolf öss, whatever you say. No. I'm Franz Lang, a farmworker from Gottruppel. What is to be done with people like you? Did you really stand at the door to the gas chambers? Looked people in the eye as they disappeared into that hell? Really? You? My name is Franz Lang. That is how we lived in Auschwitz, let's say, like animals. Because there was nobody to pull down the blanket for us, nobody to ask us how we were, nobody to hug us. There was nobody. When we arrived there, I was little, more than six years old, and Andra wasn't even five. It was a few months before she would be five. That's why there's much we don't remember. But we quickly realised that you lived a life here which wasn't a life. Very close to our hut stood a smaller hut whose door was always open. It was full of corpses skeletons, because the dead were skin and bones. It was not only in the gas chamber that people died. BRITISH WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATION UNIT I don't remember what was going through my mind. My first day began with an anonymous letter. We received many such letters in autumn '45 intended to turn in war criminals to us. BERGEN-BELSEN CONCENTRATION CAMP 15 APRIL 1945 After British troops liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp a War Crimes Investigation Unit was set up. It was to bring war criminals before a British court in Hamburg. A few months after the end of the war. We had a mountain of work ahead. ARREST OF JOSEF KRAMER, BERGEN-BELSEN COMMANDER And I was part of it. Anton Walter Freud. A Jew from Austria. In 1938 our family fled from Vienna to London. Freud, I presume. Captain Walter Freud. Reporting for duty, sir. My boss is Antony Somerhough. The soul, the driver of our unit. You have a famous grandfather. - Did he flee with you back then? - Yes, sir. What was he like, the great Sigmund Freud? Probably someone who pierces you with a look, what? I fear I wasn't particularly interesting for him, sir. I've read your dossier. Not too keen on the principle of command and obedience, are you? That will change here. Understood? Yes, sir. You quickly lose your bearings here in every respect. One of the few women investigators is Vera Atkins, who, during the war, got female agents in behind the German lines. The Belsen witnesses are in your care? Some won't stand up to the pressure in court. I make sure they stand by their statements. Has this Rudolf öss confessed yet? Not yet. Hanns Alexander acted as an interpreter after Bergen-Belsen was liberated. He had been marked by this experience. Did you take the photos? - Yes, last week in Belsen. - In Belsen? What's there to see there now? Nothing. Have you met Anita? She survived Auschwitz, then Belsen. You're Hanns Alexander from Berlin? Yes, Berlin! Formerly. Fred Pelican from Upper Silesia had survived Dachau as a prisoner and is now working diligently to capture his former tormentors. - You worked on the Krupp case, correct? - At the start. - Then the Americans took over. - Can I show you something? Did you happen to come across a Dr. Bruno Tesch in your investigation? No. Tesch and Stabenow. There's a direct link to Auschwitz. Just like with Krupp. It was to do with the unhygienic aspect of destroying people. Tesch apparently made a few suggestions to the Wehrmacht. Zyklon B. Developed in Hamburg, then sent direct to Auschwitz by Tesch. If all that is true then he's the architect of the extermination. - I say drive over there. - That would be good. Freud? Coming? We want to get going. - Major Atkins. - Is he in there? He looks the worse for wear. Did our people do that? He can be glad he's still alive. Your name? I've already said, Franz Lang. You are Rudolf öss. - The commandant of Auschwitz. - No. No, no. My name is Franz Lang. Who is the man in the picture? Right. We'll try a different approach. Hold him tight. No! No! No! You must be mistaken. You are Rudolf öss. Member of the SS Totenkopf since 1934. Is it true about 1.5 million people were killed in Auschwitz? No. Really? You really still want to deny it? No, it wasn't one and a half million, it was 2,354,000. How can you boast about it? There is no reason to exaggerate. You are the biggest of the mass murderers in any case. Me? A murderer? I never mistreated or indeed killed a prisoner. And I never tolerated mistreatment of prisoners by my subordinates. The extermination of the Jews was an order I had to obey. An order. We, the SS, had to carry out this order and had we not carried it out at that point, then later the Jewish people would annihilate the German people. You have a family, don't you? Five children? Yes. Given that, didn't you ever feel anything like sympathy for your victims? I did. If ever I had doubts the decisive factor was always the absolute order and Reichsührer Himmler's rationale for it. HAMBURG OFFICE OF TESCH & STABENOW INTERNATIONAL FIRM FOR PEST CONTROL POISON GAS SHOWER That can be filed. Stand up. Are you Dr. Bruno Tesch? - Yes. - Good. Come with us. If you wish. All go home, please. Don't touch anything, everything stays where it is. Are you mad? They've closed the business. Freud! No ship can set sail. No ship can now leave the port of Hamburg! Where's this Tesch? We need him for the extermination of vermin on the ships. Otherwise we can't guarantee supplies for our people or the population. Sir, what about his accountant? He could take over business temporarily. If that doesn't work, Tesch is a free man again this evening. My supervisor tells me that even we need your services. You see! We have made Mr. Zaun acting MD of Tesch & Stabenow until you can take over again. Mr. Zaun needs a number of authorisations from you. So I'll leave you alone and then you can talk in peace. - Very well. Thank you very much. - Thank you. Did you sign anything for them? - A confession? A statement? - You should know me better than that. They are just bastards! Look what they've done to our fine Hamburg. Hundreds of thousands of Germans murdered. Women, children. One of the secret service officers is a young Jewish man. Alfred, give this list to my wife. Not tomorrow. Today. Thank you very much for your cooperation. Mr. Zaun, one more question. - Jacket off! - Yes. Did Dr. Tesch give you anything other than authorisations? Do you always carry so much cash? What's this then? "All the files, all journals, the paperweight on my desk. Burn them all, completely. Nothing must remain. Bruno." So you were going to help get rid of important evidence. Well It didn't work. STAFF WAGE PAYMENTS 1ST HALF-YEAR Freud. There's something here. Look. Delivery lists. All written in tiny script. Zyklon B, delivered by Tesch direct to Auschwitz. Here, the deliveries to the camps. Auschwitz 1942.1943. 6 February, 480 kilos. 9 March, 526 kilos, 6 August, 1,756 kilos. - We've got him. - Perfect. Did your firm deliver 12,174 kilograms of Zyklon B to Auschwitz in 1943? DR. BRUNO TESCH TESTIMONY IN THE CURIO-HAUS TRIAL, 1946 Yes, the figures must be correct as they are taken from our books. I assume, Tesch, you knew Zyklon B causes instant death in humans? There can be no doubt about that. Tesch, if people were tightly packed in a gas chamber, how many would be killed? If they were to be so tightly packed then gas would not have been needed. You couldn't put more than 50 people in a room of 50 cubic metres. GAS CHAMBER AUSCHWITZ CONCENTRATION CAMP They would have suffocated, anyway. On September 16, 1941 900 prisoners of war came here for the first time Were you ever there when the gassings took place? No. You were in the SS, I assume? I didn't do anything. I wasn't active in the party as I didn't have time. All I did was to pay my party subscription. Look at this. I could spit! It's ridiculous! "Concentration camp commander in court." - What is wrong with that? - It's a farce. Not even one in ten will be held accountable. The SS team in Belsen alone was 500-men strong, 500 men! - And how many are we putting on trial? - Every one we can. That's why we're here. Or why I am. Yes, that's why you're here, Mr. Freud from Vienna. - Hey, come on, leave that be. - No, I won't. Who are you? We were waiting for you! What's the meaning of this? - Want them all against the wall? - Yes, Captain. All. There and then. - Hanns. - Freud, I saw it. I was there. I saw Bergen. I smelt it. No one would have asked you why, no one would have held you accountable, everyone would have understood if you'd killed them. - We'd have been heroes. You're right. - But it's still murder, Hanns! We mustn't be like them! You'll never understand what happened in Belsen. Never. Anita, I - I was there. - As a liberator. I can't understand why we put these people on trial, why we give them the luxury of a courtroom. Every Nazi has a cyanide capsule. They can simply silence themselves. But we must make them feel what they have done to us. We have long lists of perpetrators. Do you want to silence them all? The Russians are somehow more practical. When they find out these things, they look for the culprit, they find him and shoot him. But we don't do such a thing, no. But it would be logical. Dehumanisation was the goal, so how much humanity can they expect from us? There is no just punishment here. I'm sorry! Commander of the concentration camps Natzweiler-Struthof, Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen. You really made a career out of it! JOSEF KRAMER, CAMP COMMANDER, AUSCHWITZ, BERGEN-BELSEN I don't understand. I was fulfilling my duties. Nonsense! A gas chamber for human experiments was built under your command. In which, in '43, you murdered 86 women. The university needed them for its collection of foreign races. Is that so? The Nazis we are questioning here are all similar in the way they sit in front of me in their worn shirts. None of them sees himself. They only see the others. Liars on the way to the gallows. It was my duty to oversee everything and maintain order. MAX PAULY, CONCENTRATION CAMP COMMANDANT, NEUENGAMME In April 1945 in Neuengamme, there were about 10,000 prisoners. There were beds for about 8,000 prisoners. The mortality rate was about one to two percent per month. Many died of tuberculosis due to the lack of clothing. - And malnourishment. - The food in Neuengamme was good. Good? When last questioned, you stated there were no gas chambers in Auschwitz. Do you stand by that? This may be important for you to know. We have extensive evidence that proves otherwise. So do you stand by that? I saw the gas chamber for the first time in Auschwitz. It was attached to the crematorium. It wasn't working during my first eight days. After eight days, a train arrived from which the gas chamber victims were selected. How did you punish any offences possibly committed by the prisoners? Beatings. I imposed this punishment for stealing bread. Three days without food for smuggling letters. Prisoners who tried to escape were sent to the prison block for six months. It was not allowed that there were executions - using grenades. - Stop right there! Stop! No gassings in my time. Well, shot while escaping. Why didn't you put a stop to the killing? öss alone gave orders about the gas chambers. That's not what I asked! I want to know you personally didn't stop the killing. Is that so? So orders. From öss, from your boss. It is not a crime to follow orders. Take him out. - I am not a bad person. - Take him out. My wife Rosi would never have married me otherwise. Out. - She is sticking to me, you see? - Get out! Do you know a Dr. Heissmeyer? Yes. Professor Heissmeyer experimented on children in the camp. When from? The children came to Neuengamme at the end of 1944. When the camp was evacuated the children, accompanied by Dr. Trzebinski, were sent to Bullenhuser Damm. - Tzebinski? - Trzebinski. I had a clear mandate from London, arrest 500 Nazis by April. Five hundred. But now Now we have öss. The importance of this arrest will only be understood by future generations. This arrest makes heroes of us. And we British will make him stand trial. To you, Alex. Captain, I'd like to say I helped see a few thousand SS people hang, but that's never going to happen, is it? Well, thank God, some will die off in the meantime. I'm sure of that. That's some compensation. Here - A small substitute for a medal. - I'm honoured, thank you. You have to get to the bottom of this thing with the kids. - Can you do that? - Yes. Yes. Of course, who else? Sit down! AUSCHWITZ CONCENTRATION CAMP CHILDREN'S BARRACKS, 1944 Why is she coming here? Keep quiet. Keep quiet or she'll hit you. If a doctor comes, asking if anyone wants to go with him, you must never put up your hand. You must not step forward under any circumstances. Understand? Not a word to anyone. Do you swear? Good. Lie down! It's lockdown shortly. Lie down. It's a secret, understand? It's important, Sergio. The blockova told us to keep quiet ANDRA BUCCI AUSCHWITZ SURVIVOR not to move when the question came who wanted to see their mummy. We told Sergio that too. I remember us telling him and him listening. He was probably convinced he would say no. - Only we three know about it. - Only we three? How boring! I don't like the blockova. Maybe mummy will collect me and we'll go home. You mustn't ever raise your hand under any circumstances, Sergio. TATIANA BUCCI AUSCHWITZ SURVIVOR My memory of Sergio. I remember, or I'd like to remember, how he was before we were deported. SERGIO DE SIMONE ANDRA AND TATI BUCCI'S COUSIN The last summer we spent together. The summer of '43. This is one of my favourite photos. It shows us sitting on the pavement. I think it may have been outside our house in Fiume. Three children, excited, happy, laughing. The following summer we surely never laughed. But here, we are still three carefree children who haven't even noticed that a terrible war was going on. And they have a lot of locks too. It looks funny. Bluma! Come over here. Bluma, come here. There'll be trouble if the blockova sees you. - Be careful. Hide here with me. - Isn't Mummy coming today? But she told you. Is she dead too? So how will she find us? Mummy said we must never forget our names. - Your name is? - Andra Bucci. And you? Liliana Bucci from Fiume. Should I stop calling you Tati? No, you do! Liliana Bucci, known as "Tati." Generally I speak about it, but I wouldn't say I like to. Above all, I want this to never be forgotten. I don't remember where he slept, where he was. Yes, he slept in the same hut as us. But I don't remember where exactly. We were here because Mengele mistook us for twins at the unloading ramp. AUSCHWITZ, REMAINS OF THE DESTROYED CHILDREN'S BARRACKS Many of the children in the barracks were twins. But many were not. Sergio, for example, was an only child, but he came to these barracks nevertheless. Because Mengele experimented on twins, but not only on twins. He also did experiments on other children. Not at mealtimes. DR. TRZEBINSKI'S FAMILY HOME HESEDORF NEAR BREMEVOERDE - Dr. Alfred Trzebinski? - Yes. What is it? I am arresting you by order of the British Army. I'm sure it's a mistake. I'll be right back. Why am I here? I have patients waiting for me. Purely routine. Have you spoken to your colleagues at the Hesedorf release camp? - I worked there for the British Army. - I am aware of that. What do you want to know? Dr. Trzebinski, you were a doctor in Neuengamme? - Garrison doctor, correct. - Garrison doctor What were your main duties? Well, for one thing was the health of the inmates working there. And the other things? We also had to care for the many victims of the Allied bombing of Hamburg. The few hospitals your bombs spared were hopelessly overstretched. Dr. Trzebinski tell me about the human experiments. Pardon? AUSCHWITZ CONCENTRATION CAMP All the blockova said to us was, "Do not step forward under any circumstances if anyone comes." She never told us who would come. We think it was Mengele. But we're not sure. - Who would like to see your mummy? - Me! In any case, someone came, a man who said these things to us. Whoever wants to meet their mummy, should step forward, or raise his hand. We're going. To my mum and my dad. Watch out, we'll see them. You too? We'll miss you. Hold hands. In pairs. You all want to see your mothers. Are we going by train? Where to? We think that Sergio left us here. Because it's not far from our barrack. These are the only rail tracks leading in and out of Birkenau. So they must have left from here. He may have waved to us. We were here with all the other children from our barrack who remained with us in Auschwitz. And that was not a sad moment. The children were laughing. They were sure they were going to their mummy, so they were happy. The sun is coming up. I'm tired. At the behest of Dr. Heissmeyer you carried out experiments with typhus pathogens on Russian prisoners. Or at least supervised them. Did I? - And on 20 children. - Who says so? Two inmates of Neuengamme concentration camp. Dr. Heissmeyer was responsible for the experiments, not me. So you admit these experiments took place. - Were you involved in carrying them out? - No. We didn't want Heissmeyer in Neuengamme. He wasn't even a professor then, only a doctor. He carried out his experiments to become a private lecturer. Good. In the men you have infected with TB have you been able to detect antibodies? The test subjects were malnourished, sick. That makes for false results. I will continue with animal experiments and young healthy subjects. With children too? Quiet. Keep quiet. They should be well fed. I'd like it to work this time. Maybe you could calm them? I'm told you're a devotee of laying on of hands, magnetism and eye diagnosis. Hermann öring trusts eye diagnostics and alternative practitioners too. I can only visit Neuengamme once a week. I'm relying on you. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! NEUENGAMME CONCENTRATION CAMP They must have arrived at this barrack, in the mistaken belief that they would see their mummy again. We've heard a lot about it, but I can't imagine it. I really can't. What these children were promised! Everyone, find a bed. - It's warm here. - Where's mummy? I don't know, Sergio. I have to go now. Where's my mummy? Shopping. Should she get something for you? Yes, of course. What? Ice-cream. What flavour? Strawberry. Sergio was an only child. And following his birth, his dad, Eduardo, had started going to sea. He was never at home. That's why Sergio really lived in complete symbiosis with his mother. They were as one. FIUME ITALY, 1944 Sergio, go outside. To play. Go outside. To play. - Catch me then! - Faster! Faster! The first to eat ten pieces! A spoonful for mummy. Mami. Go, get a move on! Sergio. I'm Pio. Don't be sad. Don't you want any soup? Sergio, I can see the sea. And I can see your daddy, arriving on a ship in Italy and he's got lots of toys and apple strudel for his little boy. And you know what? He's caught sea horses that you can ride on. No, Pio, you can't ride on them. You're stupid, as stupid as a potato sack, an idiot, a herring's tail. Sergio, you shouldn't say such bad things. It's not just us here. My name's Pio. And you're the herring's tail! Liar! If you don't shut up, the doctor will come. Give me back my Pio! - Come and get him! - You won't get past me! Give me him. He's not yours. Stay here! Stop! - Don't hurt me. It was just fun. - Got him! It was just for fun! Here you are. Are you all right, Pio? We came to a house where a giant and his wife and seven daughters lived. They each had a golden crown on their head. - Give it to me, I'm better at it. - No! The giant's wife felt sorry for us and persuaded her husband before eating us, to fatten us up a bit. So we were put into the girls' beds. During the night, I secretly swapped our nightcaps for the crowns. And so we escaped from the evil house of the giant. Did they get home safe and sound? Of course. They went home, rich and healthy, to their parents. Come with me. Come. - What's your name? - Walter. - Your surname, Walter? - Jungleib. I am twelve years old. Sit down. Let's take off your shirt. Arms up. Now open wide your mouth. We want to see if all is in order in your mouth. So, open wide. Open your mouth. Wider. Wider. Very good. Like that. Come along. Come along. Please. No, I don't want to! Did it hurt? And x-ray. The children are racially inferior. They'll fall ill from the TB injections like weakened soldiers. I'm twelve. I shall prove that with a further infection of cutaneous TB the children can be cured or immunised. I'm Jaquelin Braun, dying at 13. Experiments on guinea pigs are futile. They do not contract tuberculosis. We always spoke German at home. That's good. Mom, please. Where is Dr. Heissmeyer? No idea. One day he suddenly disappeared. NEUENGAMME CONCENTRATION CAMP THE INFIRM AND CHILDREN'S BARRACKS We were all loaded into this train. Come along, kids! You've earnt that! Onwards, go! Go! Good. Raise your arm. - Will it hurt, Dr. Florence? - Yes. Does it hurt? Rubbing it in doesn't hurt and you get an anaesthetic before the op. DR. FLORENCE PRISONER, NEUENGAMME Dr. Florence? Do you have a first name or is your name Florence Florence. No. But you can call me Florence Florence, Mania. My name is actually Gabriel. Guardian Angel Gabriel. I thought so. Come on, arm up, Sergio. I'm cold. I know, but it won't take long. I heard you worked as a runner in Auschwitz. Yes. A big job for a little boy. I gathered clothes. Now comes a jab. Ouch! LIVING TB BACTERIA IN SCARIFIED SKIN Wait ten minutes then bandage him. Hanns. What's up? Walter, we've found more survivors from Neuengamme. We came across a man in the process, a prisoner who knew the children. At the end of '44. You were a medical orderly in Neuengamme? FRANCISZEK CZEKLA PRISONER, NEUENGAMME Six weeks after they arrived, I had to prepare the first aid room in infirmary 1 for an operation. - For the twenty children? - Yes. Each of the children had a lymph node removed. The wounds were then packed with tamponades and sutured. What happened to the lymph nodes? They were put into individual containers with formalin and the names were written on them. A Dutch nurse told me the specimens had to be handed over to Dr. Heissmeyer immediately. He was always at the operations and waited to take the specimens, himself, and examine them. LYMPH NODES REMOVED EXPERIMENTS I am Georges André Kohn from Paris. I'll be 13 in a few days' time. Daddy is the director of a hospital. We actually live in Naples, but I am Lea Klygermann or Lola. My mother You will be all right. Anton, do you have a daughter? Yes. Is she beautiful? For me, she is the most beautiful thing in the world. Do you have a photo? She's sweet. I often think about my father. I'm to blame that he was arrested. Jacqueline, you are not to blame. Only adults are to blame. But if it's true? Would you still love your daughter? I would love her so very much as only a father can. The police came to the door when she was alone. They asked to see my mother. I just told the truth. But nobody taught you to lie. So then they arrested my mother. And as we were getting into the car with the suitcases, I saw my father. He was standing there, in the shadows, on the other side of the street and he looked at me. And I shouted, "There's my daddy!" Jacqueline. I'm here, Daddy! Listen Stop. Stop! we have something in common. I am also here for the truth. Anton Now you have to take care of me. I will. I will. They said we could go back to our parents. I never believed them. You can take one thing. These men cannot see their children today. They baked and made these for you. I'd like you to look at these children so that one day you can testify to their existence and the experiments. Remember their names. Serge, say your name. Sergio. Alexander. Edo. Halka. Surcis. Georges. Bluma. Jacqueline. Eduard. Ruchla. Walter. Mania. Lelka. Lea. Would anyone like to sing something? Little Father Christmas When you come down from the sky With toys by the thousands Don't forget my little shoe But before you leave You must wrap up well You'll be cold outside That's a little because of me What happened to the 20 children? They were taken away one day. That's all I know. You don't know where the children were taken? No, I don't know. Dr. Trzebinski, why are you lying to my face? The British forces are close to Hamburg. The front line - Never will they take it. - ten km south of the Hanseatic city. Commandant. Doctor. I'm told you are too cowardly to kill the children. It is not cowardice, Commandant. Trzebinski, we have clear orders from Berlin. You deal with the children. I I needed to earn money. I worked my way up in the camp. My protective custody camp leader demanded that I beat the prisoners. ADOLF SPECK CONCENTRATION CAMP COMMANDO LEADER If I hadn't been strict enough, I'd have been imprisoned too. Your function? I was a supervisor in the Neuengamme camp. - Your function? - Sub-commander. I, personally, didn't beat anyone to death. I I occasionally beat prisoners. I slapped them in the face when necessary. JOHANN FRAHM DEPUTY CONCENTRATION CAMP LEADER I also beat them, but never I never mistreated prisoners. I always hit them on the back, never on the head. At the end of April I think it was after the twentieth. At about 8:00 pm, I was in my room when an SS man ordered me to accompany a transportation of children to Hamburg. Hey, wake up. We're going to another place. Pack your things, get dressed. - Sergio. - Where are we going? APRIL 20, 1945 9:50 PM Serge. Serge, come on, you have to get up. Pio, it's still so dark out there. Yes, it's dark, but let's leave. Come on, Sergio. Are you dressed? You see, Pio? Mummy's waiting. Come on, line up. Come on! Yes. This way. Please follow me. At 10:00 o'clock, a vehicle arrived with about 20 children arrived who were between six and 12 years old. Who else was there? The vehicle was accompanied by Trzebinski, Dreimann, Speck and Wiehagen. - Trzebinski, the camp doctor? - Exactly. The driver was Petersen. Jauch and I then went outside to receive the vehicle. They then took the children into the school. And in the cellar, one after the other, Trzebinski injected them in the heart. All the children died immediately. This war is an English war. CASINO BRITISH INVESTIGATION UNIT Our objective is the destruction of Germany. Germany will be made a desert, that's what Churchill said. But he has changed his mind. Fat, but impotent, that's how German should be. Churchill knew that we can never coexist. Never. My grandfather observed the phenomenon of the Nazis well. He described it like this. As part of the mass, the individual acquires a sense of infinite power which allows him to act on impulses that he'd have to curb as an individual. - Just like my last visit to a pub. - True. You want to question Frahm again, Freud? Yes, something doesn't add up, and I have to know. Trust me. There is a contradiction. Trzebinski says he did not administer a lethal injection to the children. No? And he claims you did not go straight to Bullenhuser Damm. Well We may first have gone to Spaldingstrasse and then to Bullenhuser Damm. - To do what? - In Spaldingstrasse? Obersturmührer Strippel ordered us to load up 20 or 30 Russians. Who were also taken to Bullenhuser Damm? The nurses and doctors were there too? Yes. And the children? CONCENTRATION CAMP OUTPOST BULLENHUSER DAMM SCHOOL, HAMBURG Get out. Move it. Move it! Mr. Trzebinski. Mr. Trzebinski. You have nothing left to lose. You will hang. Are you sticking to it? You don't know where the children were taken? Commando leader Adolf Speck. I quote, "About 20 children aged between six and 12 years old were loaded into the vehicle. Two prisoner supervisors were in charge of the children. Wiehagen and I got into the back of the car." Who could have been in the front? I was. Where did you drive to? To the school on Bullenhuser Damm. We arrived around 11:00 pm. Frahm and Jauch were waiting for us at the school. Where exactly were the children taken? - To the cellar. - And then? What happened then? I have another sworn statement here. "And in the cellar, one after the other, Trzebinski injected them in the heart. All the children died immediately." - It's not true. - What's not true? - Are the children alive? - What? No. But I didn't kill the children. If you didn't kill the children, who did? Undress. Everyone. Now. Hurry up! Why do we have to undress? Don't be afraid, children. We just want you to be healthy before you see your mummies. So before you set off on your journey, I'll inject you all against typhus. But in order to give you an injection you have to first take off your clothes. Agreed? Are you afraid, Sergio? Of the cellar? Or of the injection? Pio, maybe. But just a little bit. I wanted to ease their final hours. I called each child to me individually. To make the children think it was a vaccination, I used a new needle for each child. The children then went into another room and a new child came to me. That's it, there you go. - Could the children have been saved? - The children couldn't have been saved. Himmler, himself, had ordered their killing and no one in Germany could have helped me save them. Had I tried to save them, risking my life that might have been a good and heroic act. DR. ALFRED TRZEBINSKI TESTIMONY, THE CURIO-HAUS TRIAL, 1946 However, the children would still have died. The fact that, before their execution, carried out by others, I gave the children a mild and merciful injection of morphine to ease their final hours, was more of a humane deed of which I need not be ashamed. Into position! Quiet. I'm ready. She's being taken to bed. So the children were not killed with an injection to the heart. No. But instead? Trzebinski gave them an injection to make them fall asleep. And were the children then dead? They had stopped moving. What happened to the children who who still showed signs of life? They were hung up in another room. How? On hooks in the wall. Like pictures. Pio, you shouldn't sleep now. Mummy's coming. I don't want to miss her, Pio. She should take me away from here. Daddy has been waiting a very long time. Mummy doesn't know this house. If I go to sleep, you have to wake me up, so I can run to meet her. My name's Sergio de Simone. I'm already seven. We actually live in Naples. I'm Lea Klygermann or simply Lola. I'm from Poland. Ruchla Zylberberg. Eight years old. I am from Poland. I am Alexander from Holland. But everyone calls me Lexie. I'm Walter. Walter Jungleib from Slovakia. I am 12 years old. And I have a big sister, Grete. I am Georges-André Kohn from Paris. In a few days I will be 13. I'm Jacqueline Morgenstern, I'm 12, almost 13. I was born in Paris. I'm Bluma Meckler, but everyone calls me Blumle and I'm 11 years old. And when the children were dead what happened then? As far as I know, several Russians escaped that evening. Were you rewarded? Oberscharührer Jauch and I got cigarettes and schnapps. Trzebinski ordered us to clean up everything. Finally admit it. - You gave the order for their murder. - No! I was present but I was not Frahm's superior. My sole thought was how to get out of this in one piece. You all killed the children. I didn't kill the children. Jauch and Frahm have got together to put the blame for it on me. The pair of them are brutes who don't care if they are dealing with children or adults. You are responsible for the children's death. When the war was over, we were liberated by the Russians. I remember a jeep. A soldier was sitting on the bonnet. He had a board on his knees and was cutting slices off a salami. And we children surrounded him. There were only children. We were all standing around the jeep. And he kept giving each of us slices of salami. It had the taste of freedom. We're nearly there. Is this what England looks like? It's so beautiful. They took us to Czechoslovakia. We stayed there for a year. Then we came to England. Do you have a children's home? - Yes. - And are there other children there? Many. Like us? Yes. We last saw mummy in Auschwitz and we haven't heard from daddy either. Daddy worked as a cook on a ship. - He was taken prisoner. - And the ship was sunk. - The captain sank the ship himself. - So the English don't get it. Have you heard anything from our cousin Sergio? - Is that your cousin's name? - Yes. NEUENGAMME SUMMER 2021 You're Tatiana? What a beautiful boy! All three are so beautiful. When I heard you say, "I am Andra Bucci," I was very It's uncanny, a very strong feeling. As if it were me. I have another question. How did you make contact with your parents again? Our parents found us. At the end of the war, our mummy was no longer in our camp. Our mum had the idea of sending a photo to the children's home. The photo that was taken on their wedding day. We were called into the office, the manager of the home, Alice, showed us the photo and said, "Do you know these people?" And we immediately said, "Yes. That's mummy and daddy." Our mum always made us say goodnight to the photo as we went to bed. She didn't want us to forget our father. He was a mariner. It is thanks to this photo that we were able to go home. To Italy.
