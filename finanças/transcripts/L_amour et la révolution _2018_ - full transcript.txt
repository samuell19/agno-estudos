Let me through! No, you need to wait here for the riots to stop! There are no riots for me! They exist only for you! I can deal with my own security. Please, make room! So, I will pass from here. Don’t push me. Don’t push! Don’t push! I don’t! It’s just this fantastic bike! He hit me! What? Did I? Poor sweetie! He says I hit him! Jerking off is healthy, makes life more beautiful! You get more muscles, a cleaner face and it is free! Now that’s enough! You playmobils, get out of here! None of us is for violence. What is violence? Poverty is violence. Hunger is violence. For many, unemployment is violence. The memorandum are violence, as well as the « crisis » that rises up 9 years now. and has almost crushed the greek landscape and not only. When somebody manifests, he manifests against something he has been dealt with, against the violence he’s been victim of. But he is facing an army, armed with clubs, chemicals, guns, bullets and shields, which is not hesitating to use them as instructed against the enemy, the people. They use it in order to cause injuries, to make suffocate, to wound the ones in front of them, those fighting for their rights. MASKS! MASKS! MASKS! MASKS! No one, when going on the street, plays with their lives, their freedom and their health, just because he enjoys violence. No, we react to something. We want to protest! Let us protest! Stop hitting us! We only have our hands left! Nothing else! NOTHING ELSE! WE CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE! LEAVE US! LEAVE US!!!!! SHAME! SHAME ON YOU! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME ON YOU! LEAVE HIM! YOU BASTARDS! Hold on! Hold on! Please, I am a doctor, there is an injured and I am waiting for the ambulance. Stop gazing us! That’s up there that we should hang them, those fuckers! You’re the one protecting their power, idiots! You are guilty! WATCH OUT! NO, LET US GO! LEAVE THEM! This is not right! You are playing with people’s distress! RELEASE OUR CHILD! LET HIM GO! HE'S BLEEDING! LET HIM GO TO THE HOSPITAL! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? DON'T YOU HAVE A FAMILY? A MOTHER? A FATHER? A PENSION? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? WHAT'S ALL OF THIS?? WE'RE DEFENDING OUR LIVES DOWN HERE! WHY DID YOU EVER COME HERE! THEY'RE FASCISTS! YOU'RE HARASSING US WHILE WE'RE ONLY DEFENDING OUR RIGHTS! WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? THEY'RE FASCISTS! To us, talking about violence isn't the problem. The violence that we produce is only a small response to all the suffering we had to endure, while fighting for our stolen rights. SOLIDARITY IS PEOPLE'S WEAPON! FIGHT BACK LEADER'S WAR! To fight is like falling in love. You lose all control. You do not know what will happen the next day. You leave behind any fear you might have. Fear vanishes when fighting or loving. "LOVE AND REVOLUTION" SOCIAL KITCHEN, “THE OTHER HUMAN” FREE FOOD FOR ALL Here we are, Yannis. 4 years later. Our priority is, more than ever, to cover life needs in order to focus on different needs like building a better world. May it be possible to have some caviar? Sure, of course. But I don’t have any bread to spread it on. Here you are! Perfect! That will be great with my caviar! Kostas! What’s up? Hey, how are you? Here boy, take some! Yannis, come on, eat something. Enjoy your meal! I was working in a transportation company, which went bankrupt. This meant I could no longer pay for electricity and water. I had to live with my mother-in-law. If it wasn’t for her, my 3 kids, my wife and I, would live here in the streets like many others. I am homeless for 3 years now. I go to a centre for the homeless where I take a shower. And I come here to Kostas and the social kitchen. I try to help as I can to prepare the meal. I collect scrap metal from the garbage and make some money for myself in order to survive. Do you live alone right now? Yes. Do you have any kids? No. Certainly not! I better die than bringing a child into this misery. How do you see the future? Nothingness. Last years, the situation got worse and worse. Even at our scale, we can see it. For instance, in 2012, we cooked for 100-150 person a day, and now we cook for 1500-2000 person a day. Hence, the situation is indeed worse everywhere. Also, back then there was only one social kitchen in Athens, now there are 15 all over Greece. Once again, we voluntarily chose to cook just in front Siriza's office. And we will always be just across from any political office. These people have to realize we have to take our lives into our hands. We don’t support to live like slaves anymore. This needs to stop! We need to be aware of it! If I don’t liberate myself first, I would not be able to liberate anyone else. That’s the point of the social kitchen : to help each other and to emancipate together. I am free and I try to liberate all people, no matter their origins. So that they feel free. THEY TALK ONLY ABOUT PROFIT AND LOSS! WE'RE STANDING FOR THE VALUE OF LIFE! GOVERNMENT, EUROPEAN UNION, GREEDY BANKERS… THE BASTARDS WANT TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSES OF THE PEOPLE. NOT EVEN ONE HOUSE FOR THE BANKERS! We are the coordination of the collectives of Thessaloniki and we are at the city’s district court so as to stop banks and government from snatching people’s houses and property, who are going to be sold for the benefit of banks and the state. They are attempting to snatch people’s property in the limits of a politic that have already deprived people of their salaries, jobs and every social right and now want to take possession of suffering people's houses. Every Wednesday, hundreds of citizens come here to claim for a booming NO! WE'LL ALWAYS FIGHT POVERTY AND FASCISM! We were a handful of people when we began entering the district courts where bankers and notaries would point fingers at us and cops would kick us out... And finally this handful of people, after a lot of struggles, became a wave of rage, that took over the courts. We finally succeed to reverse the role between the perpetrators and the victims. We succeed to impose our rights and to fight back against all those attacks. We find hope in our struggle and it's on this path that we found happiness. We are the generation of the economic crisis. The doomed generation. To not attempt to change things would be like digging our own grave. If there is a personal reason why I am part of this movement is because I know what it’s like losing your home at an auction. I know what it’s like watching your parents stressed over how to provide for the family, what’s like to lose your neighborhood, to change schools and to feel lost and find myself in complete distress. My name is Daouda. I am 16 and a half. I came to Greece when I was 15 years old. I come from Ivory coast-Burkina Faso. I had to leave my country after my parents were murdered by the army, during the civil war. Before arriving to Greece, I traveled through Lebanon, Syria, Turkey. I've been through a lot of violence during that period. For instance, at the borders between Syria and Turkey, I was chased and robbed of all my stuff. While running, my leg got trapped into bared-wire. Not only did it hurt, but I was also stuck. Fortunately I succeeded in freeing myself and escaping. One day, I made it to the Aegean Sea. In front of me, I could see Greece. Europe! The only thing left for me to do was to find a boat. Before reaching the shore, the boat sank and I did not know how to swim. Fortunately, I was wearing a lifejacket and the comrades at the beach of Chios saved us! It was people from Exarcheia, from everywhere, taking us out of the water and into safety. Some days later, I came to Athens where I was told to go to Exarcheia. There are a lot of solidarity squats here and many antifascists comrades. We feel supported and safe. “We wear hood to look ourselves in the eyes” I had been living in the squat Notara 26 for 6 months. After a neo-Nazi attack I had to move elsewhere. I met a lot of people who helped me out, who I now consider family. Truly, they offered me the courage to continue on my path. Without solidarity, « LOVE » I don’t know where I would have been today. I don’t even know if I would be alive. "PAPERS FOR MIGRANTS" Exarcheia (center of Athens) ALEXANDROS GRIGOROPOULOS STREET MURDERED BY A POLICEMAN AT FIFTEEN YEARS OLD ANTISEXIST PARTY ON EXARCHEIA SQUARE BETTER BE UNEMPLOYED THAN A COP During the summer of 2015 many refugees were coming to Greece, so on the 25 of September of the same year, we decided to occupy a building of the Ministry of Employment, for refugees and immigrants to live in. Since then we have accommodated more than 6000 people, from nearly 16 different countries. For our squat, Notara 26, there have been two different periods. The first one lasted till March 2016 and the agreement between the EU and Turkey, The refugees and the immigrants were coming to Notara so as to rest for some days and then move on towards the borders, towards another European country. The second period was after the agreement. For instance, right now, there are families who have been living over a year at Notara 26. Hello, I am from Afghanistan. It’s been 9 years since I left the country. I run away from the war. Afghanistan is a very dangerous country. My father fought the Taliban under terrifying conditions. I also had to leave because I am a member of the persecuted tribe, Hazara. In addition, I am obviously a woman! In Afghanistan, they torture us: they oppress us, beat us and rape us! For those reasons it was impossible for me to stay there. So I left Afghanistan behind me. At first I made it to Iran. I stayed there for 8 years. I married and had two children. But, with no papers, I could not pursuit any studies and my kids could not go to school. Once again forced to leave, I chose to resort to Europe. Having two kids with me, it was complicated. We crossed the Aegean Sea under very difficult conditions. I was terrified! When we arrived in Greece, we were sent to a refugee camp. It was horrifying! We were left with simple tents, in the cold and rain, and no other help. But we finally found shelter here, at Notara 26! It is a wonderful place that we love a lot. Can I leave now? The basic principles of Notara 26 are solidarity, self-organization and direct democracy. We hold a meeting once a week and all the residents participate. I say residents and not refugees because they prefer that term. The residents and the solidarian, all together, make the decisions. Being a living body, sometimes, there are disputes but we come to a consensus. Notara’s meeting starts around past half eight or nine till and lasts up to midnight and sometimes up to one or two in the morning. The first part of the meeting is about general information, while the second part is about our projects, the squat’s operation and the various problems that exist. For instance, we often discuss issues like the safety of our squat, cleaning, cooking, the kids’ education, our collaborations with other squats for migrants refugees and also political questions like whether or not we should participate in demonstartions, projects and political actions. We discuss solidarity proposals from Greece and elsewhere, solidarity convoys, ways we can help as solidarian and not philanthropists. When it comes to the resident's participation to everything that happens at Notara 26, the participation to the meetings, the participation to work teams, those people who left war zones or dictatorships, came here and help around. Some don’t want to. It’s like the Greeks, the French, the Spanish, the Americans... There’s no discrimination between people and their different cultures. There are many Greeks who just sit around on their couches, doing nothing. It’s like that. On the 24th of August of 2016, fascists attacked Notara. It was an arson; they really wanted to burn dozens of kids, dozens of kids and their families, We were lucky there were no victims. We were quick to evacuate the building, there were 100 people living here then. With people’s solidarity, in only 15 days, we were successfully operating again! The fascists attacked Notara 26 during the night, in the darkness. They couldn’t act during the light of day. This is the real face of fascism which wears various masks! Fascism is hatred, death, slavery, humanity’s biggest folly! To you, the child saved from the waters Or born here into the stream Among the traded humans On a wounded planet The old world is falling apart Everything that lives is in danger The plundering ideology Led us to this sinking Yet the rebels help each other for Newborn utopias Which colors will bloom tomorrow? It's up to you, to everyone! Which world for tomorrow? Which world for tomorrow? Which world for tomorrow? Notara is a big family! I wish you a long life To harmoniously blossom To gather your talents Naturally free among equals With rainbow smiles and with honey-flavored kisses without hate and fear, No gods or masters I simply wish you… to be. Which world for tomorrow? Which world for tomorrow? Which world for tomorrow? I... write. You... write. Where do I write it? Write it here. Wait! I am 16 years old. I am in highschool. My name is Christina and… I felt the need to help because of the Other Human. During a summer in Chios, Kostas was there to cook for the refugees… and all the other people there of course! This was my first experience in which I felt I was leaving my own little world. Giving courses to migrants children, I have the feeling to help them to express themselves. An independence which is growing lessons after lessons. My objective is to let those who can't express being able to finally find their voice. I help around in two spaces where they tell me they are surprised I do this at such a young age. But... I don’t believe age matters. What matters is empathy and the need to... help and participate ! When you feel this way, you simply come to help! Being an adolescent, I feel that this made me more mature, more grown up. I believe more kids my age should come and help here. Growing up mean taking yourself out of your bubble and use that energy to try to make the world of others better. Like many in France, these last years I followed the social movement in Greece. The manifestations, the strikes, the riots... While at the same time thousands of refugees were coming to the shores of the Greek islands. I had to go! I had never come to Greece but... I had to come! Since the September of 2015, I have been to Greece four times. I take a leave of absence anytime I can to do so. I still haven’t been to Acropolis or to beautiful the beaches, or any close islands, simply because solidarity is what motivates me. I often meet Natalia in Greece, at various places and different times, and I thought she lived here. I just found out today that she lives in France, comes here because she loves us a lot and participates in lots of our actions. I participate in various initiatives of solidarity, in various self-organised spaces like here, the social kitchen network. Why do I do this? Because I cannot stand the world as is. I need to do something, to try even if it doesn’t make any big difference. Come on! Let's go! We ought to help these people because we understand them. Some say we help around only the refugees; those who say such things help nobody anyway! We help the refugees land the Greeks alike! We help ALL Humans, we don’t distinguish them. A man is a man! Period. We can’t put him in boxes! Is he a refugee? Greek? Christian or Muslim? WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS! Whether it’s a Muslim who bleeds or I, we all have the same red blood in our veins! I help humans. “Exarcheia's star” is a very old and historical team. Its function is based on self- organisation, solidarity, freedom. Self-organisation to us mean that we don't care about championships or winning and that we don't have any president. We act with solidarity towards all, whether they are refugees, immigrants, poor… Here is our principles and they're revolutionary! It doesn’t matter to be the champ! Champion of what? Of a championship? No! Champion of life! Love, solidarity, revolution... Right Daouda? Thanks! We are at the square of Aghios Panteleimonas, 3-4 kilometres from Exarcheia, in a neighbourhood which was claimed by fascists 4 years ago. In addition to the self-organised structure of Exarcheia, we created a team of healthcare and came here to reclaim the neighborhood and offer medical services to everybody: Greeks, refugees and immigrants. The premises of Distomo started functioning during November 2014. Aghios Panteleimonas square was, for years, a field of gathering and organisation for fascist gangs of Athens. We came here with the logic of radical antifascism to reverse this situation and create a zone of freedom... a zone where kids of all colours, race or origins can play together with a smile on their face. These last three years, we led dozen of actions : Action against the main premises of Golden dawn... GET THE FUCK OUT YOU NAZIS! NOT DOING THE BIG BOYS NOW LIKE WITH THE REFUGEES! OPEN UP, OPEN UP PALS! GET OUT! GET OUT! WHERE'S THE SUPERIOR RACE NOW? SHOW YOURSELF! GET OUT! (Neo-nazis won't come out) We intervened at the square of Aghios Panteleimonas by reopening the playground while also making sure the fascists stay away... We manifested with motorcycles, we participated in demonstrations for the trial of Golden Dawn and for other neighborhoods who are struggling in poverty. And one of our most meaningful victory of the last 6 month, has been the attack of the premises of the new fascist Greek party “LEPEN” that caused their total closing. Our new place is at the same street where the fascists had once opened their offices. The antifascist and antiauthoritarian place Distomo bears its name from the village Distomo, which was slaughtered by Nazi Germans during WWII. The past, the present and the future are linked together and interact within our daily reflexions and daily choices. We are at the heart of Crete, at one of the few valleys of the island, under the mountain Dikti where, according to Mythology, Zeus was born. In this beautiful valley, they have planned to construct an airport without any valid reasons. The decision for the construction of this airport was taken in order to face the problems of the airport Nikos Kazantzakis at Heraklion : its proximity with the city, and its difficulties to cope with transatlantic flights, especially during the summer, when there are lots of tourists. A measured extension of the actual airport of Nikos Kazantzakis would be much cheaper, and could easily improve Heraklion's situation, while conserving the proximity with the harbor and the actual road network. Regardless that the expansion project was done and ready, suddenly a political decision was taken and swept all of the technical and scientific conclusions, by ordering the construction of a new airport, into the countryside, 40 km away from the city. The beginning of construction of the new great project of the national airport of Kastelli has entered the final strait. The new airport of Kastelli is expected to occupy 6000 acres. The overwhelming majority of the media use stereotypical slogans about development, advertises this project as the o called major developmental project of Crete without justifying the use of the word “development”. Development for whom? A project that of course all Crete cannot wait for! I believe it’s going to be warmly accepted, unless… They chose the most wasteful solution. An economical and ecological catastrophe with huge social consequences. This project is going to cost 5 times more than expanding the existing airport. A financial delirium in a period where most Greeks try to survive the continuous policies of austerity. In addition, a great part of flora and fauna will be wiped out. Mountains of 11 million cubic meters are going to collapse. Building that new airport means necessarily to cut down 200 000 olive trees, that are the jewels of life and production across the island. That olive tree has been planted by the grandfather of my great-grandfather. It's 200 years old. That's 20 time my own age. I will let no one cut it down! It will put to waste a land of high production value and of course our water. The aquifer of the area is important not only to the nearby villages but also Heraklion. The inhabitants of the nearby settlements are going to find themselves only a few hundred meters away from that new airport. They will have to move because of the conditions, the air, water and noise pollution, and of course their loss of agricultural income or because of strict expulsion. I feel lucky to be born on this land. Later, I chose to stay rather than serving a boss somewhere else. Today, I find myself, like everyone else, facing that catastrophic project. This will mean the destruction of our area and I will not let them do it! Nobody will! We stroll about from all Zone to Defend with the energy of movement Creating on our way meeting and mobilization spaces As numerous inhabitants and farmers We want to participate into a take over By struggling populations and movements of the future of the planet. No to an airport at Kastelli! NO TO THE AIRPORT! The crowd : SHAME! SHAME ON YOU! Again : SERIOUSLY? - The objectors will talk! - Please wait! Concerning the noises pollution… The crowd : WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! We need to rise against the crime they are prepared to commit to our home! Once again, Rouvikonas records their raid at the Spanish Embassy! Members of the anarchist collective Rouvikonas have climbed the stairs of the parliament and blocked it! How did the anarchists got through security? Nikos, hold on, a moment please! Rouvikonas emerged at the Hilton where discussions with Troika take place. They entered the most secured place of the country : the Ministry of National Defence! They entered the Pentagon! Will they ever catch them? Who is Rouvikonas? We are from Rouvikonas! Please stay calm. Using this phrase, the members of the anarchist collective introduced themselves while raiding the bank of Greece. Rouvikonas is an anarchist political organisation which wants and tries to be in the front line of social and class fights in Greece. It’s a means of street opposition to the regime and the government. In its 3 years of presence, it has carried out hundreds of actions: Poster sticking, distributing of texts, meetings, manifestations, opening of social spaces, occupations, interventions… We use all means of fighting. In our agenda of actions, Rouvikonas is aiming for the most hideous infamy of the power, but we also deal with daily problems that touch directly the workers. It could appear secondary but not to us. We use our own video so firstly they can’t change the meaning of our actions and secondly they can’t hide what happened. The most part of our actions are already impossible to hide. It’s difficult to hide a raid on the parliament or on the palace of the prime minister. Therefore, we have the capacity to break through the misinformation and media omerta. Since we have our own video footage, we can control the image of our actions and they cannot be defined by the interest of others. Our image, our propaganda! ROUVIKONAS STRIKES AGAIN IN LARISSA Total surprise at the National Electricity Company : Rouvikonas called out to the director. You should be ashamed to disconnect the electricity supply of people! Especially in winter! While some firms owe you thousands and thousands of euros! They entered everywhere, threw these papers writing : “ELECTRICITY IS A SOCIAL GOOD! NO HOME WITHOUT ELECTRICITY OR WATER!“ We don’t want anybody to define our future. We want to define our future. We have no other goal but to turn this world into a new one. This is our job, what we're trying to do. Tiresias offices is the black list of Greek banks where people who owe money are listed. We destroyed the place. This way, we show that with a little organization people can intervene, fight back, and show that the enemy, even powerful, is not invincible. They enter OUR parliament! OUR courts and protest! Seeing all the damages… Is everything out of hand? Exarcheia is a symbol of resistance for the social movement in general, but also for the government who can be afraid of it. Many men of power are thinking of a plan to evacuate the quarter by force. while others wish to do so with development, metro stations and other projects. The plan is to destroy the symbol that is Exarcheia and the annihilation of the people that act and create at Exarcheia. The minister of Interior : Does Exarcheia need to become like the other neighborhoods of Athens? Of course! The police never come here! I’ve had a car accident at the street Spirou Trikoupi and Stournari, at the square of Exarcheia. You are at the square of Exarcheia? Yes. Can you go somewhere else? We cannot come there! Where is the State? The only reaction you get is: Miss, we can't do anything, move out of Exarcheia! All supermarket chains have left! The nearest bank is one and a half kilometer away! The National Electricity company has already left, so did the dominant telecommunications provider! The State subsides more and more! They have raised their black flags, showing off who controls the area. Everybody does whatever they want, whenever they want it! The leader of right opposition promises : I will finish with Exarcheia during my first month! Immediately mocked by the social movement : "What do you mean Exarcheia is still unfinished?" "Beware!! I'll make Exarcheia vanish!" "I’ll finish my espresso first and then Exarcheia." "What's up? Have you finished with Exarcheia?" Since there is power, Humans have always made fun of it. From ancient Greek texts to satirical comics and memes on the internet about Kiriakos Mitsotakis and Tsipras. As we say it here: “A laughter will bury you.” "KOULIS, THE NINJA OF EXARCHEIA!” “We're coming!!!” “ROBOCOULIS : CAN CUT SPAGHETTI WITH A SINGLE HAND!” “HOW I DESPISE YOU EXARCHEIA'S BUGS, I'LL TERMINATE YOU IN A MONTH!” Here! Here! Come here! They ask people to offer shelter to the rioters and to throw flower pots to the police from their balconies. “THE AUNT OF EXARCHEIA” Come on, let’s drink the bottle and make it into a molotov and if the cops come, they are doomed! Don’t worry we’ll do as the anarchists instructed : I will throw flower pots, you’ll throw Molotov and wildfire! Aim for the head on this one! There! Go away! Let’s give the kids Maalox, they’ve been hit by tear gass! THEY ARE HERE! QUICK! COME! PISS OFF! I am Perseus. I am Kinimatini. We are taking care of the YouTube channel Perseus999. It’s a channel that upload images and news of actions of resistance and manifestations from Greece. We have around 10M views. On our channel, we have uploaded 293 videos. Most of them are correspondence from actions and manifestations of the antifascist and antiauthoritarian movements of Athens, but not only. The reason why we hide our faces is mainly because of repression. During the past years, we have been hit, imprisoned, tear gassed... Generally, the camera annoys the cops especially when it shows their wrongdoings. Don’t! Don’t! This is repressing the Press! It’s censorship! Perseus and I met when we were both arrested. We were both at an antifascist action and suddenly we were encased and then arrested by the cops. We noticed that both of us used video cameras to record the events... Here we should thank the Greek police for bringing us together and being the reason we do what we do today! Thank you! Thank you very much pals! The mass medias always used the same method to shoot the events : Even the photographer reporters are always behind the cops, showing the rioters from this angle! That choice lead the viewers to look at the rioters through cops point of view : As the enemy! We wanted to do the exact opposite and show people the point of view of the protester. To show that the protestor is only reacting. He’s not the one who makes the first move. He goes in the streets because he reacts to something, defending himself. Because sometimes the media remains silent to some actions or reactions, we show that something actually happened, how many people were there since the media often shorten the numbers of the participants, so we show that something occurred, and because often these things end up in violent episodes, we show who started it. We feel it’s not enough to see something recorded by someone else. The final goal, what really matters is to inspire people, so they also go in the streets. It's an invitation to not remain into voyeurism and passivity of TV. We are in an open war with the systematic media. We choose not to use them, to have nothing to do with them. But we have forced them with our own actions and productions to present our videos themselves. Another action from Rouvikonas, this time at the court of the city! this time at the court of the city! in the center of Larissa! Here are their images! The way mainstream media use editing to misinform is scary. More than 60 anarchists from various countries came driving to Exarcheia so as to support the migrants! They used images of the convoy when it arrived at Exarcheia. They edited together with some old images from our channel, some images from 6th of december riots, I guess. They mixed everything up, editing it to tell that the convoy was bringing war weapons! Some others news broadcasts said that the convoy was here to only help refugees. A convoy of 28 vehicles came to deliver food and supplies for refugees only! A demonstration of international power from the anarchists who came to defend the squats! They tried to create a climate of major terror concerning the convoy and why it was here! Many of the vehicles had foreign plates ; the police and intelligence agents try to find their owners so as to see what they carry and where they come from. It was a great action of solidarity that terrified the media! Our answer was a picture that was made public through alternative media. A picture of masked men carrying stocks of milk and diapers. Those are the weapons of solidarity. You don’t have to fear us! The mass media use of fear as a technic is not something new. We, on the other hand, we use solidarity against fear. That’s what terrifies the mainstream media, that’s why they target our solidarity! There is powder and tension in the air, with the antiauthoritarian convoy that arrived yesterday : people are alerted! What troubles the police is that they arrived a few days before the 17th of november anniversary! Greeks anarchists occupying Polytechnical School are receiving anarchists from Europe in reinforcement. At Exarcheia, the haunt of Rouvikonas, entered Katernina with the camera of Star News! Their actions is escalating, their first target: the Council of State! But they need however, weapons ! The time of tracts and tags is done! Time is for helmets, iron sticks and hammers! They were given by anarchists from France who entered Exarcheia in trucks! We have been seeing trucks with foreign plates unloading stuff at various places! The leader of Rouvikonas openly invites those who want to join their ranks! Exarcheia is filled with menacing slogans on the walls, even Kalashnikovs! You walk on the street and suddenly you can be facing a Molotov! What was that? Rouvikonas ? No, it was the nature. Of course, it is not funny when you’re raided by Rouvikonas! Anyway, I was saying... I’m sorry, I’m sorry! NO No to Kastelli airport SOLIDARITY IS OUR WEAPON The continuous attacks of the anarchist group electrify the political confrontation! The leader of right opposition : You're the one responsible for the rise of those savages! Tsipras answer : We need to condemn in the most exemplary way, the unacceptable threats of someone who calls himself an anarchist and member of Rouvikonas. The government decided to accumulate all the cases concerning Rouvikonas into one big trial, with the aim of labeling us as a criminal organization. We’ll be there in any trial, we’ll win! Rouvikonas does not fear anyone and anything. We’ll take no step backwards! Greece, the renaissance Alexis Tsipras: “Nobody could believe it” Did you hear the last joke? They say the Greek crisis is over! These people are mad! “The Greek crisis ends tonight!”, that’s what the Commissioner for Economic and Financial affairs, Pierre Moscovici, announced. The beginning of a new story for Greece! It is an exceptional and historical moment! The Greek crisis ends here, in Luxemburg, tonight! This is the best joke I’ve ever heard! My mother was taking 300 euros of retirement pension and now she’ll be taking 250 euros a month! But the Greek crisis is over! The Greeks finally get by! They are not even close to pay their debts! There was unbelievable work done for 8 years, it is a positive example of the help that was given. After years of crisis, there is finally optimism. The Greek crisis is not over. The Greek crisis is not over because it never began. Greece was barely an experiment in the laboratory of economic globalization. The capitalists reduced in half both salaries and pensions, they want to buy everything cheap. No, nothing is over in Greece. The fight is ongoing. What crisis? The crisis hasn’t end because it is not just economic : It’s a war! a fight that was put in place by the banks, the Capital whose only goal is to make more money and make slaves out of most people... Greece is an example of that. Banking interests, companies, they come here and evacuate areas that they buy almost for free, humiliating people in the process. They buy life! That's exactly it : They buy us! Do we want to be sold? Of course not! We’ll be there, on the streets, as long as it takes! In the streets, telling the truth, fighting for our lives, showing ourselves that we won't live like slaves! Money will never win over life, regardless of its power, Because there will always be people fighting against it! The question is not why someone belongs to the movement, but why he doesn’t. Why doesn’t he fight so that his neighbor doesn’t lose his house? Why doesn’t he fight so that a child can be able to sleep in its own bed every night? Why doesn’t he fight so that water is a public good? Today the neighbor’s house may be at risk, tomorrow it might be ours. Tomorrow they will cut off our power and water supply. All the people who believe nothing can change, they cannot tell us which victory they got by giving up! We, however, can tell them what we conquered with our actions. All together, we will continue to resist! I'm sure that more people will be on our side, against this airport! Cheers and no to the new airport! Cheers! We don’t have much hope for what we do. We don’t expect major results. What matters to us is that every day we wake up motivated and able to look at ourselves in the mirror. I don’t think I’ll stop what I am doing. It’s not about doing things in order to fill up you time, it’s about feeling the need to participate. We prepared the things. We loaded the cars and we go straight ahead. The gang is big. There is me, Antonis, Wilson, Yannis, the other Yannis and his friend, Vassilis… We arrived to the meeting and we cooked the peppers pasta. We discussed about our political prisoners with a testimony and a call for solidarity. Konstantina joined us with a cake, followed by Mitsos and Dimitra : awesome moments! Finally came, Konstantinos, Elena and Michalis. I, I talked about you, the one always in my heart… Food is not the essential. It is the Trojan horse! The Trojan horse so that people come together! Even those who came in hunger, it's not especially the food that brought them here! The food is just a means to come over and exchange some words! That's it! A way to chase indifference! There is a lack of love in this society, that's true. Terrible difficulties! Terrible bureaucracy! Above all, thirdly... a tremendous fear of love and revolution! I mean the revolution as a synonym of love, bearing that love. The word solidarity is also relevant. What does that word mean? To me, solidarity is love, respect, human contact. It is not philanthropy. It is not feeling pity for others. It’s respecting them. It is not about helping him because I can, it’s helping him even poor, with conviction, helping from the bottom of my heart. That’s it, solidarity. The difference between solidarity and philanthropy, is that charity is vertical : to help with pity, when solidarity is horizontal : to help each other as equals. Not only I give what I don't need, but I also give what I need the less than others. Let's not forget that all that is based upon love. If there is no love, none of this can exist. Without love, no revolution and no solidarity. Yes, it’s both love and revolution : love meaning passion here! The fight, the everyday presence in the streets is a passionate love. A love for life. That's what we wish for our society. That's the unstoppable love of life and of dignity, that is pushing us to fight and never give up, with no expectations in return, endlessly, hoping and waiting for better tomorrows. Notara 26 is both a space of love and revolution. Love for what we do every day, taking our lives into our own hands. Revolution because we put utopia in action. We have a slogan that says: “PASSIONATE LOVE OR NOTHING.” It can be also translated as : “ALL OR NOTHING.” I like the first one better though because there is a push in it, there is this urge in love. The word love makes you blush, but it hides urgency in it. Think how it feels to be in love. You give your whole self. Think now how it is to be in love with life. With a beautiful life. I believe revolution is the movement that bring us to this beautiful life. Like a poet once said: “When we don’t die for each other, we are already dead.” Love is stronger than the borders that incarcerate us. Here, in Exarcheia, there are no borders. We live together, we fight together. Actions defeat fear, apathy, paralysis and open roads. The worse is not a bad or small action but no action at all. We ought to do something every day. An action with whatever means... This is our simple message: Let's act or let's shut up! We should self-organize! That's it! And it's so easy! So easy! We are thousands, millions!
