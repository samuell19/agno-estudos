I really believe that I heard voices. Well, maybe you did. How can anybody say that you didn't? - I think I'm... - No. I want us to go away. I think that getting away would help. Adam. Adam. Adam! Pretty good turnout, right? - Like the spread? - Yeah. Yeah. Really, really got me. I don't think I know any of these people. Oh, no. Oh, no! - Excuse me. - Yeah. No! Yeah, no, no... - None of these people are here for you. - Yeah. Yeah, totally. But there's definitely someone I particularly want you to meet. - Yeah? - She's right over there. - Yeah. - What? - Yeah, okay. - Okay! Yo, that's it. Yo, I just had to build you up a wall just to say hi to a girl. Well, look at you growing up with your big old suit and your tie. - Yeah. - You're doing it, baby. This is great. Making progress. Okay, look. Okay. Go to the bar, get a drink. Chill out. - Mm-hmm. - And I'll be there. You okay? - Yeah. - All right. Adam. Adam! Adam! Adam! - This is K. K, this is... - Adam. Yeah, I just heard you say it like five times. Hey! Oh, she is sassy as fuck! Hey, happy birthday. And I'm your best friend, and I hate you, so I'm gonna leave you all to it. Okay. - So what are you drinking? - I'll get you one. That'd be smart. So, do you know all these people? No, not really. Looks like they're celebrating something. Yeah. Yeah, uh, I don't know. Listen, I know, if I'm like, talking a lot, uh, and it's, like, annoying you or something. - I just... I get really nervous... - Wait, I'm sorry. - when I just... - Talking a lot? Are you serious? No, Just come on, for two seconds. Just be serious. Okay? Okay. Like a... a radio. - No, that doesn't count. - I could tune it. And I could listen to people talking. Um... - Okay. - Okay. No. Uh, okay. One thing - on a desert island. - One thing on a desert island. Uh, could I bring someone like you? Oh, my God. You're not joking. Um... That's against the rules. No. I know that you hate people. - So it doesn't count. - I don't hate people. Yes, you do. No, wait! Wait, hold on. What exactly do you mean by "a person like me"? Oh, are you like having a conversation with us in your head or something? Oh, no. Uh, no, that was... that was dumb that I said that. That... that was dumb that I said that. You know, someone who could like, you can, like, build stuff. What, like a jack-handy type girl? No. Not a jack... Not a... No. Like, just someone who, you know, that's not what I meant. Okay. I think you're... just think you're really smart. Yeah? Stupid. Stupid. That was... that was dumb. I was just... - It was a dumb thing to say. - No. No, that's not dumb. I just... hope the conversation's going well. How about you finish that and close your tab? - Yeah. - Yeah. He may have run away. - Find him then. - Yes. You must find him wherever he is. I'll go to his apartment, wait for his return. We cannot wait. We're losing time. Typically, for a period a place with happy personal associations. But can we get stuck in nostalgia? Can it be harmful to us? All right, try now. Yeah. Here we go. That's it. Okay. Three weeks on this car. Can't even get it to start. Yeah, hey, it's Adam, down at the shop. Uh, I got, uh... just wanted to remind you I got the truck down here. Yeah, I, I, uh... I don't know if it's the battery or the alternator or what. Um, I won't bore you with the details, but, you don't need to call me back. Eighth man up in the inning and it's been a wild one. Now, Clay Carroll checking out the sand with Johnny Bench. It's a two-strike delivery. Ground ball... The Reds lead, four to two. We never had a honeymoon. We always told ourselves we'd have one, one day. Remember? There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling transmission. We will control the horizontal. We will control the vertical. We can change the focus to a soft blur or sharpen it to crystal clarity. For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear. You are about to participate in a great adventure. You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the outer universe. Yeah, hey, it's Adam, down at the shop. Uh, I got a... just wanted to remind you I got the truck down here. Yeah. I, I, uh, I don't know if it's the battery or the alternator or what. Um... I won't bore you with the details, but, yeah, uh, no need to call me back. So... Hey, it's me. You. Me. I'm on Mitchell Road, and I remembered there's a hardware store down here. It's got auto parts, I think, and, uh, there's a lock on the door, so bring the key. It's marked on the map. So you won't forget. All right. - Yeah. More, more wood. More wood. - More wood. Adam! Come on! - I can't! - Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Great. That's great. No, no, no. Oh. Fuck! I can't fix this. Mm-hmm. Eight miles. You know I just saw you. Well, I... I don't know. I don't think you did. I just straight up saw you look at my ass. I... I was looking that direction, but definitely past... past it. Right past it, so... No, you looked right at it, and then... you licked your lips. I think you want me to say that I looked at it, or is that what's happening? I just want you to loosen up. - Yeah. - You know? - Yeah. - You're just a little... stiff, a little rigid. Just, you know, shake it off. Yeah, totally. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I can loosen up. - Yeah. - Almost. I've been out here a long, long time now. What is that supposed to mean? Oh, so, honey, I hear you an Adam will be moving in together soon. Yeah, yeah. We've been talking about it. Mm. Isn't that right? Uh, yeah, that's... That's right. All right, then, it's settled. To K, Adam. Oh, what the hell are we gonna do about that? Where do we even get that? I don't have that in the house. Tom, I told you to get gas last week. You were supposed to go through the garage to look. All right, everybody, stay calm. We have to keep packing. Damn it, Jane, we don't have to leave tonight. We're packing in case we have to. I don't know what to do. Yes, we're gonna fill up the bathtub. And we're gonna keep gathering supplies. And Adam and I will make a run for gas. Once we get back, we'll have a better idea of what's going on and make the decision if we stay or go. But if... if we go, we have to make it to the top of the mountain and see what's happening. Top of the mountain. Top of the mountain, so we can see what's happening. What direction is best to go in. We just... We have to stay together. What the fuck! Shit! They were there. They were there, and then... they were gone. Adam, Adam. - Adam. - Yeah. Come on. Really? What? I'm not making it up. I saw it. You saw it. You've been out here a long, long time, man. What is that supposed to mean? Usually have to peel you off the wall just to say hello to someone. You were never the person that would care about what people think. Now, that's all you can think about. Maybe you're looking for someone who isn't there. That's bullshit. So explain the house trap. Who are those for? I don't... I don't know. Uh, that's... that's what I'm trying to figure out. What the fuck you don't know? We're the only ones out here. We're the only ones out here. We're the only ones out here. We're the only ones out here. It's... it's different now. It's not that different. It's just you and me. Just like it used to be. You didn't think I had a chance. I definitely didn't think you had a chance. No. I didn't think I had a chance either. And honestly, I don't know what happened. It probably should have been you. Yeah, but, you know... You're a smart guy. You ever heard of failing upward? That's you. I've never met someone that just... hung out in the bar, in the corner by himself, avoiding everyone. And still ends up leaving with the girl. You MVP, man. Would you believe me if I told you I didn't know how I got here? Sounds like failing upward to me. Now, look, man, I know you. You got some tricks up your sleeve. You know, I thought I'd eventually get up here, and see something. I've been trying to get up here for so long. That was always the plan. And now that I'm here, I feel like I've been here before. Like I've felt that before. Mm-hmm. Deja senti. - Deja senti. - Already felt. You felt something and then forgotten it. A taste, a smell, a sound. Someone's voice. Then you experience it again. It's different, but it feels familiar. Like hearing yourself speak. But then realizing, in fact, you didn't utter a word. Hey, it's me. Just wanted to remind you that you haven't gone shopping in a couple of days. Supplies are getting low. Uh, there's still a shelf of powdered milk in aisle two, so, you know, just... just go in there and take it. Uh, you don't need to, like, wait in line and do that whole thing, so just... just go in there and take it. Uh... okay. Bye. Hey. Yeah. So, you know that one trail we used to cut back from, you know, from behind overlook. Uh, don't... don't go that way anymore. Just trust me, okay? Just... just don't... don't go that way. Hey, it's me. You, me, us, whatever. Uh, you know, you know who it is. Um, just, yeah, you know, I know who it is, you know who it is, It's not like anyone else is gonna call, you know, which, I don't know why you never pick up the phone. Um, it's just like a... I just think it's time that we get up to the mountain, you know? So just let me know when you're ready to get up there and check things out. Okay? Okay. Okay. Yeah. They're gone. Everyone. I don't, um... She's... she's gone. Just... just don't, um... Just... Adam. What are you doing? Adam. What are you doing? Huh? I said, what are you doing? Why're you so dressed up? Dressed up? I just got some errands I have to run and... got a hot date tonight. So... - Hot date? - Yeah. Well, don't have too much fun on this date. I need you to come back here to me. Okay. I will. She's kind of a weirdo anyway, so... - A weirdo? - Yeah. She likes to build stuff and she's got this lumberjack pipe. I'll see you later. Yeah, I'll see you later. Please get a clean up on aisle one. Aisle one clean up, please. We got a broken bottle, glass. Need some help. Clean up on aisle one, please. Thank you. Little help on aisle one, please. Anybody? Can I get some help, please, aisle one? Come on. Open. Fuck. Shit. Come on! Come on. Champ. The champ. He's a champion! He's a champion! That was wild! Everybody's screaming for him. Right? He's not a bad bowler. That's what they're saying. Not that bad. He's okay. Whoo! He's got ten pins. He's got one chance. Oh, that was so close. Not good. Not a good one. He's a champion! He's a champion! He's a champion! He's a champion! He's a champion! He's a champion! Whoa! He's a champion. Hey! Wait! - I'm sorry. - It's okay. You have to let me go. The idea of you is the only thing keeping me alive. The idea of me is slowly killing you. I can do that all by myself. I know. I know.
