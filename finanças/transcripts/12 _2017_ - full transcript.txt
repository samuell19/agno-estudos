--== McEphie ==-- Are those things really that important to you? Honestly, I have no idea. ‘Find yourself?’ I think so. Don’t throw stuff, please. Erika… I’m asking you one last time. Please don’t do this to me. ‘Don’t do this to me?’ Then what is this you’re doing to me? Babe! - Where are my black socks? - Antonio! - My gym socks? - Antonio, I’m naked! Antonio! Antonio! What’s wrong? What? Where are my black socks? I know where. They’re in the third drawer. You told me to put them there. Right! What will I do without you? Give me a kiss. Brush your teeth first! - Okay, fine. - Brush your teeth! So this is it?! This is serious?! Anton I love this, okay? I love what we have but… I can barely breathe. You know that feeling when you want something so much that you just don’t wanna ruin it by giving it a label. because... This setup is just fine. ‘Just fine?’ What’s wrong with this setup? I’m not complaining. You don’t want ‘just fine.’ I just need time. Time. If you don’t wanna help me, then how? Why are you acting so different? What’s wrong with you? I’m broken. What happened? Who broke you? Myself. I want to blame myself. I don’t know. I’m lost, okay? I don’t know myself anymore whenever you’re there. What? And I don’t know myself whenever you’re not there. I thought we’re good. We’re not good. We haven’t fought for some time, but that doesn’t mean we have no problems. I just keep my cool because I don’t want any trouble. You’re tired of me? Baby! You’re up early? Why didn’t you wake me up? It’s okay. Today’s meeting was cancelled. Why so? The weather. The weather? The boys are getting lazy? Boys will be boys. ‘Boys will be boys.’ And I will be me. You want coffee? No. You know what boys want when it’s raining? You want to go back to sleep. No! No? Turn around! Turn around. You want coffee? See? It fits well? No, no, no! I like this one much better. Why?! Well, first of all, this will make the place look unique. But the whole house is pink. This is your mom’s style. That’s the point! This will make the house look unique. It’ll stand out. Like you Right? Excuse me, I haven’t brushed my teeth. Plus, this one is… Red and pink stink. But, you know what, I like this as well. And I know just where to put it. Where? Here where it’s inconspicuous. You’re mean. It’s always you. You even replaced my brand of coffee. Baby, because it matches the coffee maker! How could you hurt someone you love like this? If this needs clarifying, hear me out. Fix myself: what I want, what I need. I want to fix my relationship with my mom before it’s too late. I want to work again, if possible. I think I got bored here. ‘What am I doing here, really?’ ‘Where am I, really?’ You know me. I always give in to everyone. I try to make everybody happy because it really makes me happy till I become unhappy. I try to make you happy every single day that I tend to forget my own choices in life. My so-called individuality disappeared. Is that even a thing? In a seven-year relationship? How am I supposed to know how to handle a relationship? My family, from left to right, have broken marriages. Even yours. Know what, let’s try to switch places since you have full control over this relationship. Me? Why can’t you just give me my space?! Just five minutes! I’m just—I’m just really, really mad, okay? I thought you’ve kept your cool! I’m already cool. Because I’m a dude! I can’t multitask at you! I just need time to process my anger! But why did you say you’ve kept your cool? Because I’m really okay! This is what I need: guy time! I just need five minutes. I’m not even mad at you. I just hate my job! This isn’t even about you. I’m sorry that you feel… neglected! Ten minutes has passed. I gave you your girl time and it takes you an hour to get ready! I was not furious then! I was not blowing up a fight! If you let me have my five minutes, I should’ve been fine by now! I’m sorry. I’m a girl. We can’t stand it when we don’t know what you, guys, are thinking. Stop trying to analyze every little thing! Can I just hit the gym to let it all out?! Okay! Good thing, you have the gym by your side when you feel bad! Do you realize how far your gym is? What happened? Life. It’s also my fault. You are my only life. You know why that happened? You also wanted it that way. But… I’m no longer productive. I can’t create anything. I mean, okay, I get to create something when I cook for you every day, but... Like... It seems... All my dissatisfaction piled up... What the hell is going on in your head?! No, you need to know this. - I need to... - You’re unhappy. - No, no, no. - Why? - Wait a second - What is there to complain about? Didn’t you hear me? Can’t you just let me speak first?! Let me. Every thing is going your way. What we are going to eat… How many bottles you’ll drink despite my incapacity to carry you when you’re drunk… Why we use honey over sugar, because the former is healthier, “I don’t want honey in my coffee.” Did I make you suffer? Those are superficial. Sugar?! I gave everything because I’m happy when you are. Do you want other examples? Something profound? My examples are simple. And then? I lost myself. I... I lost my personality in this relationship. Because of sugar? I… I lost my excitement for the future. The present is just fine. Just fine. If you’re serious about taking the next step. Wait, let me think. We have grown apart from each other, from everybody else. Now we’re barely friends. What could I do to bridge this gap? because... As if we’re stuck with “You’re a guy, and I’m a girl.” But do you still wanna be with me? As for me, I feel like I’m stabbing you in the back because I don’t feel like doing this anymore. So you no longer want this? It’s that— I hate being idyllic. I’m not used to that. What can I do to make you feel something again? Okay… So what can we do to help you feel more alive? It’s okay. We’ll get a new one. We did everything to save it! That’s life, baby. It’s just a plant. Come on! It was my only purpose in life: to take care of this plant. Why did it die?! Are you taking a video? Cut the crap! Baby, you are the best cook in the world! Boom! Yeah, at least I have a purpose for you. Stop it! That’s true. You are the epitome of perfection, baby! Boom! How about this? Is this perfection? There. You’re still beautiful. I know that. I love you, baby. I love you! You are the queen of everything! Boom! Look, I have all your good traits in my notes. Let me see? Wait, I’m still taking a video! As for gardening, it takes learning, you know— Baby… My baby plant… Maybe it’s not really your purpose in life. because... Why would you need a plant as a baby, when... you could have a real one? When is that? When we get married, right? Soon! Write that down. Caught in tape. Boom! I wrote it all down. What? I wrote it all down! What? That you wanted to get married before you turn 30. I’m 33 now. I made a list of all the things you like and dislike. “December 12, 2012.” “She doesn’t like mocha cake but she likes mocha frappe.” “She doesn’t like artificial cheese flavoring but she likes strawberry and grape artificial flavoring.” “She doesn’t like OPM [Original Pilipino Music] but she likes Ogie Alcasid.” “She doesn’t like it when it’s sunny; - she likes it when it rains—” - Stop that. Stop. I just don’t wanna forget. So what did we miss out on your list of my likes and dislikes? “How to be us?” “How to be who we are?” But you’re on point! You’re on point as well. Okay. So what’s to prove here? Who will adjust when we’re as good as it could be? It’s my fault! It was like your happiness was the least of my priorities. But I admit that, okay? Is that good enough? It’s okay! It’s also my fault. There’s nothing wrong if I settled on your own convenience. So what’s the problem?! Here. Before entering this room, take off your shoes! Can you imagine how many times I mop each week? Just once? Once? Not just once! Okay! Not just once! Look! Your chocolate wrappers! Why leave them here? Is this the trash bin? Do you know how disgusting this is? All these things in your credit card bill? Things that you don’t even need! We can’t pay for all of these! How about this belt? Why toss this? Will our situation change if you toss this belt? It won’t do anything! This! This wall! Am I happy it’s painted black?! Didn’t I tell you to change it because it suffocates me?! It’s depressing! Why do we have a gun in this house?! For whose protection?! I don’t want a gun, do I?! I told you so but I’m not complaining because I don’t want another fight! You don’t want a gun in this house?! Fine! I’ll throw it away! That’s not even the point anymore. I have told you long since but you don’t hear me out. Don’t worry! Keep the gun. I’m going nowhere. No way! My brother wants it anyway. I’ll let him have it. Fuck it! Are you happy now? Now that I want you to feel safe in this house? Get rid of that temper, please? Can’t you see yourself? Aren’t you the one mad? I don’t even know what’s holding us together. There’s no— There’s no joy… There’s no respect… pride… I can’t even remember the last time we made love. Last week? Two weeks ago! And you call that ‘making love?’ That was all about your needs! Why? When was the last time you initiated? Why make it appear it was always my first move. I like it when you used to initiate; it made me feel… wanted. Now I just feel rejected. When was that? Most of the time! It’s like you do it only because you’re forced to or something. At least we’re still doing it. right? When I do the first move, when you don’t want to, you don’t want to! You move when it’s bad timing! Either I’m drained or contemplating! But when it’s the other way around, when you want it, you want it! How can I even be aroused knowing that you watch porn? Blonde porn at that! All guys watch porn! Some don’t because they don’t need it. In contrast, look at you! All. Guys. Watch. Porn! At least, I don’t cheat around! Running away from the issue yet again? Can’t you settle this? I’m tired of this same issue over and over! I found us a church. Where? It’s made of best materials. It’s got spruce wood, coal stone lamps, an 80-foot cross that when the sun hits it, it’s— Let me show you. Isn’t our church beautiful? I’m thinking about building a fence right here, putting trees in the front, like that. Is there someone else? Are you crazy? That’s not the solution, Anton. Then why would you say no if you’re not in love with someone else? Where on Earth can you find that ‘someone else?’ I don’t even go out of the house, do I? Online? I can’t believe you. Why? Isn’t that hard to believe? I know you. You’ve never been single. You wait for the next guy before you go for a breakup. Aren’t we like that? You were waiting for me to take you in before you gave up on that motherfucker you were dating! That’s different. I will never cheat on the love of my life, Anton. You know I never stopped you from smoking. Even if this house reeked of cigarette, even if your mouth tasted like ash tray, I still made out with you. I never thought anything was wrong with it. Everything is wrong. I live here, you support me, and… I adore you, Anton. I really do. And I’m very, very grateful. Why did this happen? Yesterday, we were so happy. You took me out on a date after so long. I was outdoors, I was so delighted. All of a sudden, you— you proposed… And I was overwhelmed. I don’t know— I don’t know what— I realized that— No… I don’t want to get married yet. I realized just last night! Just last night or for quite some time now? Were you just waiting for me to break up with you? How could you?! I set the whole thing up to make it special! Yesterday! On our seventh anniversary! I talked to the waiters, I told them what to prepare, I got down on my knee to ask for my girlfriend’s hand in marriage, and I got a ‘no’ in front of everyone! I didn’t say ‘no.’ “I got to tell, Anton, I’m not ready!” After seven years, you’re still not ready?! What the hell! “Anton, please, let’s stop making a scene.” What was that? Wasn’t that a scene?! God! I bought you a ring! What were you thinking? That costs 80,000 pesos! Where did you borrow that amount? Anton… What made you think I would say yes? We’ve been distant for months. I thought that’s what you’ve been waiting for, that’s why you looked unhappy. No. Anton, I’m 33. Okay? I’m a woman. We have a biological clock to take care of. Unlike you, guys, you can still do it in your 70’s. This is my limit. When I think of my future with you, I ask myself, “Can I make it?” How about you? Can you make it? Can you be a good example to our children? Can you come home at night not drunk, and not act like a lunatic when you’re angry? I can’t imagine that life. Back then, I can. When I look at you, you’re easy to forgive because you’re handsome. But that handsome card does not last. The wedding you have in mind would just be a phase. After that, how about the real future, the way I want it to be… Have you ever thought about it? - Sometimes, I think— - You need to go. What? You need to move out. Seriously? Yes. Now? Yes, now! Okay. I get it. I was unable to give what you want, Okay. This is pointless. Yeah, pointless. If there is only a way! Yeah, there is only one way. It’s always your way, always your timing, always your comfort. Where do I fit in there? Look at me, Anton. Look at me. Look at me! I look so broken. I look like I’m starving to live my life. It’s always you in control. And I’m always left hungry— hungry to be in control, hungry to be understood. I’m broken. Word of the day: broken. Wait a sec. I’m exhausted. It’s hard to breathe. Effect of smoking! You’re exaggerating! When will you stop smoking? Tomorrow. You always say that. Why? We’re just the same. “Tomorrow, I will. Tomorrow, I will.” Every thing I’m doing is for our future. - Our future? - Yes. The future of our new car. Am I correct? Baby, you have to be patient. We’ll get there. Consequence of choosing a handsome guy. - Oh? - You can’t have it all. You have me. That’s all you need. - Why? - Wait. - What happened? - I need to poop. What? After everything? Why did I treat you like shit? Shit? It’s not like that. It just took me some time to process it. You did not fulfill your promises I was locked in this house with nothing to do. You said we’d move out because you can’t pay for this house. Your mom has left you so we could live independently and pay the expenses on our own. You don’t even want me to help. And I feel so useless. Things take time. I’m ready! Everything is ready except you. We’re almost there. Almost? Not almost. Not true. Please don’t go. Alright, do whatever you want. Just… don’t leave. Can I go back to music? There, the piano is waiting for you. Do it. You make great music. I’m your fan, ain’t I? I just write and sing, remember? I can’t play the piano. See, you make gold! Used to. Such a waste. You haven’t smiled for quite a while. I’m talking about something I really, really love. Your boys? The music. The band. It just so happened they’re all boys in the band. You didn’t want them around me, did you So instead of arguing with you, I just quit music. I’ve told you so before but… I know this time would come. I would have resentment towards you because I can’t do what I want to. Back then, everything’s blurred… When I met you, what’s the point anymore? My dream to create music has vanished. It’s ancient history! My dream has changed; my dream became you and me. That was then. No. Up to now. Is that wrong? My happiness is your thoughts. because... My dream back then is useless. My dream, in reality, in the end, is to find someone. Someone who’ll love me for the rest of my life. So what now?! Get to the point! We’re running in circles! Fuck it! Oh… Why curse again? Was I cursing you? Did I say “fuck you?” Oh! Fucker! Here we go again. You’re cursing as well. Because you’re doing it first! Stop it, please! Anton, I grew up in a rowdy house. I never imagined our house to be the same! Then get straight to the point so I won’t shout! Which part of “I need a break” don’t you understand? It’s not a breakup. That’s actually the same thing! Cut to the chase. The ending is the same! Hey! Oh! Baby, baby, don’t touch it! Let me do it. I got it. Let me. I got it. Hey, stop. Am I really controlling? I like how you take care of me. It’s tough love. Tough love? I’ve been here for barely 24 hours and you call that ‘tough love?’ I have to get used to it! It’s gonna be like this for the rest of my life. I have a woman now A woman… like my mom! You’re exaggerating! I got it. there... there... wait... wait... Told you so! Sit down. Sit here. Am I controlling? Really? I love you. I love you? Try apologizing. To whom? I was the one wounded. To yourself. Sorry. Bad. You’re truly controlling. Sorry! Let me get the first aid kit. Where is it? It’s upstairs in the bathroom. Why keep it that far? When did I start losing you? Do you remember the time when you asked me to make you French onion soup? after seeing it on TV. You cried, “Baby, cook that for me.” And then you left me, one day, knowing I was learning that dish. I worked hard. I failed. Took me three tries before I perfected it. When you’re about to come home, you told me you’ll just... grab a couple of beers with your friends. And then… You came home drunk without tasting it. It’s painful that I had to work on it since that afternoon. I even sent you a photo. I didn’t get that photo. It doesn’t matter, because you knew! I was wondering… why consume my entire day to please someone who doesn’t appreciate my efforts? I phoned a friend and asked her, “Does feeling bad make me a bad person?” “Am I a drama queen?” She told me, “You have all the right!” but I can’t do that to you. I just cried and cried, thinking I have no right to be disgruntled because you just went out with your friends. That rarely happens; we’re together all the time. Why should I get mad? If I start a fight, I would still end up as the bad guy. So I just kept it to myself. It hurt deep however shallow it was. I’m an idiot. You are. I remember when you got home, you asked, “What’s wrong?” I said, “Nothing.” “Okay!” But you said nothing was wrong! Yeah, but did it look like everything was okay? Anton, my eyes were swollen! How could that be okay? Maybe it was something you didn’t wanna talk about. There you go again! You expect me to read your mind all the time. Why would I even tell you I felt bad? Whatever I say, you can turn it around and make it appear I’m the villain. It’s you who’ll get mad. So what’s the point? We’ve even discussed my abandonment issues. Whenever I don’t get the attention I need, I feel like it’s the end of the world. Why try to comprehend my situation when you can’t exert an effort to keep me happy? To you, it’s about grand gestures. Piano? Why buy me a piano?! I can’t even play one. The piano is a fine piece of art. All your gifts—birthday, Christmas, anniversary— you never got one correctly. And I’m not being mean by saying that I dislike your gifts. But then again, if you only listen to what I want, you would know what to give. Do you know what I really want? Support! That you keep your word. Or that you’re here. Or that you hear me. King is home! Baby, what’s going on? Is that a joke? No, I just got surprised. Baby, it’s our third anniversary! Today? So does that mean that I don’t have a cake? What? You told me last week, “On our anniversary, I’ll get you your favorite cake with three candles.” You told me, “Don’t greet me the whole day and then greet me in your underwear.” Did I tell you that? You were drunk then. As always. It’s okay. Baby, I’ll do it tomorrow, okay? I’ll get the cake. It’s just a cake. It’s okay. Are you mad at me?! It seems you’re the one angrier at yourself? Baby… That’s just a cake. Yeah… Just a cake? You know, I value the words that come out of your mouth. They’re precious to me. So if you say something and you don’t mean it, I would end up expecting… How much do you love me today? Nine. Nine? Yesterday was eight. Today’s our anniversary, I got a nine? Why are you so mean?! It’s you. You were harsh to me. How come, even if you’re harsh to me, I still give you over 10? Even if it is so hard to love you because you’re being so difficult— Okay, fine! Alright. 10. Not 11? Alright, 12. That’s final? 12! Let’s discuss this… - somewhere more private. - I don’t wanna talk about it. Oh, you don’t wanna talk about it. Let’s talk about this. You don’t have to leave. Here we are again. I feel trapped. “Go.” “Don’t go.” It’s an endless cycle. Don’t go. You just told me to leave. I know but… I didn’t mean it. You know I love you. I told you words are just words. No! Words are poison. Words are bullets. Didn’t my mother told my father, “You’re worthless. Go kill yourself.” And he did. He shot himself! Yes, he’s weak. But you, you’re selfish. I loved you so much that you started to love yourself so much, that you forgot to leave a space in your heart to love anybody else. You only love yourself! People always say we should save save a space to love our own selves. Back then I didn’t believe them, but now I do. Your way is better. I should go first. My happiness first. Okay. You don’t wanna compromise yourself. Just be who you want to be. Find yourself. But you can’t be in a relationship and just think of your own comfort! Do you even hear yourself?! Anton, I took care of you for seven years! Seven long years! And the more I try to understand you, the more I get to wonder, “Wait! Hold on. Do I want this kind of guy? Someone he himself doesn’t know what he wants?” You know what, sometimes I saw you as the most selfish person in the world. But sometimes I wondered if you were really capable of loving anybody, because I didn’t see you knowing how to love yourself at all. You’re angry at everybody. You believe people are useless, because you’re insecure of everyone else, you’re insecure of yourself, let alone of me. You were never enough for yourself, but to me you were always more than enough. You were my king… My king, you said that, didn’t you? My king! But I see you waking up in the morning— every morning—with a big hole in your heart and I hope you know that no matter how hard you try to fill it, I know, nothing truly helps. Alcohol won’t help. Drugs won’t help. You think God can’t help?! I haven’t gone to church ever since we got together because you’re not a believer! You’re always the winner. You’re always the righteous. So I just stopped believing! Everything is lost! I doubted everything because of you! You know what? That’s it. No one really wins over you because you’re always right. You’re always mad at the world, because, in truth, you’re mad at yourself. So what? That’s just how I am when I get mad. That’s it! I might be like this but I recover quickly! I can change... but I need your help. I can’t fix this without your help! Yeah, you know, when I get angry, when I get insecure, you know, I morph into a demon, something you hate so much. But when we met, I thought we knew too much about each other that you would never hate me. You were my best friend. I never thought that I needed to adjust. I thought that… I thought that we knew our way. Shit! I thought that I found the one. I thought I really found the one. - This is it! - This is it. Are you ready for this? This is the best foot forward. You’ve already seen my worst foot. I love it! Erika, I will take care of you. I might just be man enough for somebody like you. You are man enough. Stop it! Too much drama! I’m moving in with you, see? I’m now an independent woman! Imagine, my work is two hours away from here! You want me to return to my mom’s house? Erika, let me take care of you the way I know how. I like that. Do you want a driver? No! I just want my sanity. That’s all. Let’s go? Let’s go. - Let me carry that. - I can manage. Wow! Big boy! You really are something. You think you’re the only one with gripes, ha? Because there are things about you that I don’t like either. But do you see me complaining? No! Because I love you unconditionally. Like? It’s not the point. No. I need to know. I might be offending other people without me knowing it. It’s not the point. Okay. When you try food for the first time, you do this: And when I ask you why you do it, you say it’s because it makes you taste the food better, which, I know, is biologically impossible! That’s all? It’s not really the point! The point is that I love you for who you are, the ‘way’ you are! That’s your problem? I can’t believe you. Look, please stay. You know how much I love you. I don’t mean everything that I say. Stop with your “I didn’t mean it,” Anton! You’re very honest! Your words are sharp as knives! You’ve no idea about its effect to other people! But you know how I am. How long have we known each other? How long?! Too loud. Could we just talk indoors? How long? 7 as lover plus 5 as best friends— I’m no good at math. 12 years. 12 years! 12 years you’ve known me. Even before anything happened between us, you knew how I am! I speak my mind! I’m a dick! I know it’s the truth but I make up for it. I may say the meanest things to you but I still know how to make you feel good. So what changed? Are you telling me you’ve been keeping log of every little thing? Like a fucking soup? Every fucking little thing?! I didn’t know we were keeping scores. I keep my logs as well. When your mom was sick in the hospital, who paid for her bills? Did I complain? Who stood with you? Who was by your side the whole time? You. So then when did we become the problem? Because I thought we were in this together. Now you need to find yourself? After 12 years? 12 years?! Fuck, Erika. Fuck! Why didn’t you tell me before?! Why did we reach this far? Fucking love! I hate this romantic bullshit! Is this love? That you blame me for being beside me when my mom got sick? That you paid for everything? Let’s ask why! Because I had no money, right? Let’s ask why I had no money! Because I was jobless. I can’t work... every guy I work with is trying to seduce me. My friends aren’t allowed to like my posts! I don’t have a Facebook account! I don’t have a job! I don’t have money! What else is the problem? Hurry! Answer me! Let everyone hear it! That I quit my job because it’s too far from here? That it’s better that your job is near from here? Is that my fault? Yes! What else? That we live in this house that you cannot even pay for just to prove to your parents that you can when you know that you need all the help that you can get! That’s pride. Right there. I’ve told you long ago, your pride will kill us. You’re controlling! You’re a nagger! You never let me do what I wanna do! Nagger? I just told you I’d drive instead! You’re pretty drunk already. How many chances should God give you to avoid getting into an accident— - Look, I’ll do what I wanna do! - —so you’d stop driving when drunk?! You’ve downed a number of bottles in less than an hour. I know it’s not alcohol. Tell me what you took! Stop controlling me! I’m Antonio Romualdez III and I will drink till I die! Do you have a problem with that? Answer me! Is that true? I should let you do what you want to do? Like that? Until you can’t walk to get home? You won’t forget, you can decide if you want to leave me or not, okay? I didn’t say I’ll leave you! But you’re looking at me like you wanna leave me! You really think this is gonna work out. You really think this is gonna work out when I can’t have fun the way I wanna have fun? This is how I wanna have fun! This is how I wanna live! I try to do it your way! T-T-The ‘proper’ way. And, you know what, it’s fucking boring! ‘You’re’ boring! You know what, get out of my car. Get out of my car. This is my car. Just get out! Continue smoking your fucking cigarettes. I may have toxins in my body, but at least I—I sweat it out! I run! I go to the gym, unlike you who sits at home all day… doing nothing! Why don’t you get a life? Let me be me! You know it takes five words to break a man. Five. Words. You make me feel so ugly! Just give me two minutes! Baby… Baby! Baby! Baby… Don’t leave me. I can change! I can change. Please, baby… Just give me— Just give me time, baby. I’ll—I’ll do it. I’ll change. I can do it. Please. I’m getting there. I’m okay now. I’m okay now, you see? You see? It’s how we fought. You know, you act like… Like a baby who doesn’t know how to express himself so he throws tantrums instead. I just want to punch you. I just want to hurt you. I am hurting now, the way you are talking to me now. You’re just not used having someone’s being honest with you. Everyone’s afraid of you. Perhaps, because you speak in English, no one cares to explain to you anymore. As for me... it’s a ceasefire for fighting and shouting. I’m saying this now because we won’t lose anything here. People will ask, “Why?” And I know you. You will walk with your head held high. And I will— I will walk around with my heart ripped out in my hand because I lost everything I worked so hard for. But who is abandoning this relationship? You are. You stopped fighting for us. Why so? You’re tired? ‘We’ are worth fighting for. ‘This’ is worth fighting for. Cheers! Please marry me one day when I’m ready— I mean, financially ready. You’re already drunk? Come on! You know, even if you’re not ready, I will marry you. Just don’t be too grouchy. I know. I also hate myself when I’m grouchy. Can you marry yourself? I don’t know. How about you? I can. Right away, if you like. You like it now? I’m gonna direct my first commercial soon. I’ll no longer be ‘Erika Valera’s boyfriend.’ And you know I’m your biggest fan, don’t you? Because you love me. No. Because you really deserve all the good things. I know you always say that you need the validation you didn’t get from your parents but... don’t let that ‘you won’t go anywhere’ linger in your head, because you’re brilliant, because you’re... You’re brilliant, you're... you’re creative, you’re intelligent, and you’re super hot. But you’re better than me, in all aspects. Do you think that’s true? I feel unworthy of you. Me and my fragile ego. Come here. I love you so much. I love you more. I love you more! I just... I just don’t know to show it. Let me show you how much I love you. I’m gonna take care of you. So I always wanted to prove myself to you. You know, to everyone. I made you into what I wanted you to become. You were earning so much and here I was… I was just some art director. Tonton. Who is Tonton? I was nobody and I just wanted to feel better than you. So what now? Did you find your identity? With you? With you I was a king. I found myself. And I lost myself. Stay with me. Marry me. Please! It’s not like that. It’s not like that! Not now. I had too much... Scars. Stars? Scars! Stars? Where did that come from? I’ll leave my toothbrush here. It’s cute. I can’t leave your toothbrush alone. How come you’re leaving me alone? Because it’s necessary for us to realize if we can make it without each other? If it would be better if we weren’t part of each other’s lives? If each other would still be each other without each other in each other’s way? So many ‘each others.’ I’m so scared. I’m so scared! So this is it? This is really serious? Last night, you asked me right here. Last night, you didn’t want to leave me. I love this. You know, I love what we have. It’s real! For you. You did everything to make me feel small. You were so demanding, and I became submissive until you felt secure. Even when you cheated on me five years ago. You knew it wasn’t about me. It was about you. I thought then, it was nothing. It’s not because he doesn’t love me. You were just feeling bad. Maybe you were looking for some sort of revenge. You know, ego boost? What should I ask you? Why did you hurt me? Did you mean hurting me? Are you going through some bad stuff? Are you trying to prove something? What answer should I look for? Right? Right?! Don’t hate yourself. It’s not even the reason why we got into this. If you want to retaliate, I can take it. Are you crazy? I don’t know what else to say. Marry me. Let’s try it again. After everything? That was a long time ago. I was immature. I never did it again. And I’ll never do it again. She understood me. You were always too busy to care. You stopped paying attention to me. You were always tired, too tired to make love to me, tired from working. - Stop it. - She seemed to understand what was going on. It’s my fault after all. I don’t want to hear that anymore. We made our mistakes. You made a mistake. That’s all. I don’t know how to make it up to you. I just want to shoot myself! Look at you! You act like my father. I understand you because you’re so… You’re so delicate like my father. Let it go. It’s through. Did you know that I got to a point where, when you’re asleep, I check your phone, however disgusted I was, just for my peace of mind. I can’t do anything about it. I chose you. I chose to love you. I wanted to make it work. I gave everything and you took everything. Sometimes I wish I never found out, but no, God is good to me, I get to learn everything. I don’t know. Why are humans like that? We push ourselves to difficult situations even if we already know the easy way out. We get broken while trying to fix other people. Can you forgive me? It’s done. It’s in the past. Let’s fix this! If there’s one thing I’d love to fix, it’s that we make sure our last moments together doesn’t mean fighting, shouting, blaming each other… We spend the whole day discussing pointless things. Did you know I haven’t eaten yet? Did you know I feel dizzy, my head is aching? We haven’t done anything other than quarrel and cry. The burden I carry for seven years, I’m crying out for one single day. Can you imagine how hard that is? Let’s eat? My baby is cooking! Sinigang! Your favorite. Go, go, go! Sour! Sour? It’s my favorite! - What do you want to add? - How about salt? Salt? Choosy now? Why don’t you cook? Go on, your turn. I don’t know how. Let’s add okra? It’s my first time to— I just eat sinigang. - Just do it. - I don’t really know how to make it! You’re so much better in this than I am. Do you want me to call delivery? No, thanks. I’ll just cook for the last time. Last time? Go on. Answer that. Might be important. Hello? Hello. Hello... I saw your new commercial. It’s bullshit! They left me with no choice. Fuck them! Baby, it’s cute, the way he said, “K.” - What? - The way he said, “K.” it's funny. “K?” Am I a comedian? Am I a comedian? Baby, it’s different. The guy’s acting was large. I am the reflection of my actor! It was large. What’s wrong with that? O my God! There you go! It’s on! Come on, sit down. Come see it with me. You might change your mind. Take your Risque. K! K?! Isn’t that cute? This is what you find cool?! They destroyed my career! - Baby, come on. - Fuck. Baby! This is my dad’s. Anton? Anton! I was cleaning it. This is exactly why I don’t want a gun in this house! I was cleaning it! My brother is on his way to pick it up. Keep that gun away from me! Alright, alright. Do you want to kill yourself?! Are you ashamed of yourself now?! You should do it once I left! I’m getting rid of it because you don’t want it here. I got it for your protection! My protection?! That in itself will kill me! Sorry! How stupid are you to clean a gun with a loaded bullet?! There was no bullet! I checked it! Then what was that?! People like you, who have that temper, who don’t think first, should stay away from those things! I hate guns and people like you who have them! And you deserve this: fuck you! It’s a first. Yeah. It feels good. Sorry, okay? My brother is on his way now. He’s coming from “Tagaytay.” “Ta-GAY-tay?!” “Ta-GAY-tay?” It’s “Tagay-TAY!” You’ve been around here for years, you still haven’t learned your Tagalog! You see, you’ll never learn. It’s just the most hurtful thing to say. I’m sorry, it’s not what I meant. Why are you the one sulking? Shouldn’t I be the one? Your mouth. Sorry! See? Sorry. You don’t even know how to say sorry. I’m sorry. I never got to apologize for your dad’s vase. I never know how to forgive myself. You’re asking for forgiveness now? When I really needed your apology, where were you? You were swimming in your pride, weren’t you? It’s in the past. I have moved on. Such a waste. That was the only thing left from my dad. I love you. And I loved your dad. He was the only father figure I have ever known. Yeah. You’re a match. Both dramatic and alcoholic. Do you want a beer? Which do you like: corned beef or luncheon meat? Up to you. Which do you like? That’s a first for you to ask! Don’t resist. Either. Which do you like? That’s why I don’t ask you. Either is really fine with me. Pick. You have options, right? Either of the two. Luncheon meat or corned beef? Luncheon meat. You don’t like corned beef? Just so I thought! Let’s stop this! I’ll just grab a couple of beers. Yet again? You—What do you want? I know, you want a stick! Okay. You know what I like. Of course, I do! Granted that we shouldn’t fight, why don’t we order pizza? No, thanks. This is fine. No, no, no. I’ll order. Just remember, your piano, it’s out of tune. Let’s get it fixed? You can get it fixed. Later. Why do you want this removed? Do you regret it? No. It’s the best decision I’ve ever made: to love you and to get drunk with you and get this tattoo with you. Really? As for me, this is my second best decision. What’s the first? This is my best decision. Your owl? Come on, that’s a wolf! - No way. - Dire wolf. Owl. - That’s a dire wolf. - Owl. You’re something! I research it online. ♫ It’s over now Can’t you see where I am? ♫ ♫ I danced in your lonely eyes You cried, you cried ♫ ♫ I was chasing you ♫ ♫ I was chasing you… ♫ ♫ While your colors ran into the sun I was your ocean ♫ ♫ Sweet undertow And you never drowned ♫ ♫ I was chasing you ♫ ♫ Was I breaking you? ♫ I got your favorite! Gummi Bears! Your comfort food. I didn’t forget, ice tea, too. And… sugar! Sugar! - Wow! - She’s not leaving me now! Where’s my stick? I’m sorry—Shit! I’m sorry, it slipped my mind. Hold on, I’ll go back. No! It’s okay. Just a small thing. I’m used to it. Sit down. Oh? Here we go again! Are you mad again? Why are you getting mad? I’m not even mad at you. Why don’t you just get angry instead of being like that?! How much do you love me today? One. Million? You’re really funny. Now that I’m leaving? I’m sure I’d never lose you. I’m sure you’d never give up on me. I never knew you had so many issues. I don’t know how to take care of you, I guess. We must have probably reached the point there’s nothing to discuss or defend because nothing’s gonna sound right. It’s been a long time since we last talked, like real couples do. As though we’ve become comfortable with small talks, with the silence, we’re silent as if nothing is wrong. I thought we were built to last. I thought we ended up together because we’re a match. Best friends, aren’t we? Like of the same fabric. We like the same things, right? The same food, the same movies… Everything! Yeah. Except for the core values. Small things for you are a big deal for me. Something like that. I don’t know! I thought opposites attract. Or men are just men and women are just… Or, maybe we were just not meant to be. Our personal issues killed our relationship. I can change, you can change, but our internal scars will still be there. I tried really hard to be perfect. I was not even searching for something perfect. You were the one. You should’ve believed me when I said that you deserve someone better. Hey. Do you want to punch me in the face now? Can I? Yes, you can. How about a kiss? - I realized something. - What is that? I haven’t taken a bath all day. I’m smelly now. I love the way you smell. How do I smell? Like a woman. A woman who is beautiful. A woman I love. I’ll just take a bath first. Wait, wait, wait! One drink and then take a bath. Okay! Then you can ‘maligo.’ [take a bath] I’m falling for you again. Oh, shit! Oh, God! That was even even with the burp— That’s just… - That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen. - Thank you! I know that very well. No more burp. I’ll take a bath now? and... How about you… What? Take off your shirt. - No. - Please? It’s not gonna happen. - No. - Please?! Okay! Hi! Papa Pizz— Bye, Papa Pizza! You’re naughty! You’re naughty! You will miss that. Let me grab a bite. Dress up! Take off your dress, dress up? What now? - Take a shower now! - Yeah, right. 1… 2… Since you need to write everything down, you have a short-term memory, I made you a very beautiful sketch of your closet. Top shelf: everyday shorts, boxer shorts. Here, shirts. At the bottom: your socks. Okay? I’ll take a picture and send it to you. You might lose this sketch. I know you so well. How much do you love me today… Baby? ‘Baby.’ It’s been a while. You said it’s corny. And you believed me. I think that’s what we missed out. We both became so boring. We… We both got used to each other’s company. You just became complacent while I remained, God, so predictable! The mystery was lost. The challenge was gone. You know, I used to think, God, I had the biggest crush on you! I used to think, it must feel good to be Erika’s boyfriend. She must be a caring girl. True enough, it’s what you were. It’s what you did. Until… As if… I took it for granted. I took it for granted. Because I’ve imagined what would happen. Things got ordinary… like a routine. We got so comfortable with each other that we stopped… talking like friends. Don’t you love me anymore? You stayed with me for seven years. Are you still in there, baby? If it’s just about finding yourself, you could’ve said yes, then so be it. You know, we’ll find you together. Do you still love me? Yes, Aunt Susan? Hello, Erika? Hi, Aunt Susan! Your Uncle Lucky is cooking jackfruit curry. That’s Anton’s favorite, isn’t it? He’s asking if he can send the jackfruit curry there tomorrow. He bets Anton misses it! How about that? Yeah, Aunt Susan, if I won’t be here, Anton can take care of it. Say hi. Hi, Aunt Susan. Hello, Anton. It’s good you’re there! Your Uncle Lucky— Yeah, I’ll wait for him. I just have one question. What’s that? How long have you two been together? 37 years. Why? In that span of 37 years, how many years were you in love with him? Of course, all the time! You must always be in love! How many years were you annoyed with him that you’d want to kill him? All the time as well! That’s the thing. It weighs similarly. 100%! Why are you asking? Nothing. Just a survey! Alright. I’ll go ahead. I’m sleepy now. Okay, Aunt Susan. Thank you. You see… Can you love me that much? Anton, I’m— You love me and I will always love you. What else— What else should I do to prove that I love you? Leave me. What? I never wanted you to lose yourself. I just wanted to care for you, make you happy. I know that… my way of loving you has made you lose yourself. I can’t lose you. But I’m killing you. I’m sorry I failed you. Thank you for giving me your all. Sorry I wasn’t able to give you my all. That was your all. I appreciate that very much. Don’t talk like that, baby. I will find myself, and then— Come find me again. I’m letting you go. Find yourself so I can find myself. Thank you for everything. For being strong. We did have some good times, didn’t we? And you were good enough, my love. Go. I’ll see you around. Anton, thank you. Please don’t go.
