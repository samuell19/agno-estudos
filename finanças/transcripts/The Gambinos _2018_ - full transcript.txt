Salvatore D'Aquila He was the Mafia King of New York City Having spearheaded operations from 1910 to 1926, he was succeeded by Carlo Gambino, another person of Italian descent. It was in 1920 that Carlo's underworld presence was felt in American Mafia circles. And his family went on to become the one of the world's first Crime Families Carlo's gang was known to have a hand in almost every illegal deal in the area They were famous for committing all kinds of crimes and leaving behind no trace They were well-networked with officials in high positions who were given handsome rewards for joining hands with them. In 1976 Carlo Gambino died of a cardiac arrest Even though he is no more, the Gambino family seems to continue their illegal operations all around the world It was in the 1970's that the Kerala Police's reports began to talk of a similar crime family The deals made by a person called Carlos and his family -- who had migrated to North Malabar -- were giving the police a hard time. Every effort put into arresting that criminal family kept resulting in failure Kerala Police began referring to this family as the "Gambinos" In due course, Carlos become the King of Kerala's Underworld Mafia. He had no competitors. The story goes on ... I'm the Doctor. Where is your mother? Yeah, come on in. She is over there. God takes back his favourite people a bit too early. Don't let the tension get to you, son. Grandma came to know of it only when the Doctor called. I have made all the necessary arrangements. The Doctor tells me that she had been sick. Before her death ... Mummy did not want anybody to know about her illness. That's why I did not inform anyone. I'm sorry. In a way that's better. She left without having to trouble anyone. You don't have to live all alone there, son, Grandma is coming You can go about your work even if you stay here. OK Phew! These steps! Come... You've grown When I last saw you when you were a very young boy. Take your luggage. Hmm Come, let's go. It's getting dark. Get in It was after Dad's sudden death that my mummy became ill For the past few years mummy and I had only each other, to call our own Now, after mom's death I feel really lonely. How is your new place? It's not bad. Grandma's house is near Jawahar Colony. Really? I stay near there. My place is barely a a kilometre away. Oh, is it? Who else lives with "mamma?" My uncles. Four of them. Why have you never spoken about them? I didn't respond to that question of hers. Even my mummy had never told me everything about them. Maybe she did not like seeing them or being associated with them. Mother was afraid of them. Similarly, they also lived a life of fear. Mother tried telling me something about them before she died But she couldn't talk clearly with all the pain she was in. What could it have been, I wonder. 3...4...5...yeah Hey, I've already counted that. Can't we just put it away, then. Hmm...yeah Don't sniff that thing it in like that! The oldest among them is Jose uncle. He's gone into hiding. The police come looking for him, every now and then. My other uncles too do the same business as Jose uncle. I always see them stacking money. But I don't really understand their business. I think it's something to do with drugs. Oh..you're up Mustafa? Here Do you need some juice, son? No, Grandma Do you like your stay here? Yes, all's good. The juice is good. (You should have some) Thank you, I don't want it. Hey... hey, come here come, come, come Ah! here he comes. Haven't you finished counting as yet? Yes we're done. How much do you want? Put three stacks in my bag. Haven't you heated the water as yet, mother? Oh no! I forgot. I'd told you that I had an appointment at 9. Don't get angry. I'll get it done right away. What is this mother? This baby will fall sick if he bathes in cold water. Keep it in Get lost, man! Their mother means everything to them. And to her, they (mean everything to her). Their mother supports them in all their illegal activities. I'm trying to get used to all of this. The most decent one among them is Aby Uncle. Only Aby uncle has a family. He is the only one who wishes to stop all these illegal activities and lead a new, clean life. He's even talked about this to everybody other than Jose Uncle. They all make fun of Aby uncle However, he still hopes for a better life. Hey, give it to her also. Be careful What happened? Isn't lunch ready, yet? It's getting ready Just 5 minutes more... It's been taking forever. I'm starving here. Hurry up! What's up? Are you hungry? I'm hungry, too. We seem to have the same menu. Idly in the mornings, Rice in the afternoons. Why isn't there anything on the table, yet? Please calm down, Aby. Catch! Don't you have a car to play with? I will buy you a Benz. This isn't today's paper. Is it in the bedroom, then? No, I haven't brought it in, yet. It's already noon. You couldn't have done that, by now? I have been busy all day. Okay, I will get it. The police keep looking for Jose uncle. They keep an eye here, all the time. Aby uncle usually mocks them and sends them away. Even though it gets on their nerves, they don't make it obvious. The person you are looking for is not here, nor does he ever come here. What do you know about what our intentions are? Get Lost! Do you want this flower? It's got a really good fragrance You won't find such fragrant flowers anywhere around here. Take it, sir. Haven't you been waiting for a long time! Take it. What arrogance! I'll take care of that arrogance! Forget it. We'll get him another time My wife and kids are in the car I told them I was going to go get some vegetables. You said you had something to say -- Things are not the same anymore. You have to increase 'my share.' My answer is still the same. That just won't happen. Then, we are going to have some problems. No way. You won't share the losses of this business, would you? Now, that... The way things are, you're getting stuff for free. That is how it is when you get easy-money. Typical human behaviour! Solomon, don't forget that I'm a police Inspector. I've been passing on a lot of information to you from our department, That's because we give you ten times what your department pays you in a whole year. I can easily replace you with any of your superiors in the department. But you've been part of our deals since my father was running the business. So now don't start getting too greedy, Sudhakaran. Musthafa... Ask Jose to stay in hiding for a few more days. Sound the horn. Speed up...overtake them. Sound the horn... We'll deal with them right away. Hey stop, you buffoon. How dare you drive while you are on the phone! Get lost, you bugger! I'm gonna... They don't know who they're messing with I'll teach them a lesson Shit! Hey, hold this out. Why do we need this? Just blow his brains out. Shoot! Get down! Come out! Hey, look there... What is your problem? Get down. Come, if you've got the guts. Where are you going? Why are you loitering around? Bang him right in his chest! Bro, let's scoot! Run! Now do you see how powerful this is? What do you say, Musthafa! What do you want? Hey, What do you want. I asked my son. Not you. Eat, son. What an appetite you have! What is it? Why aren't you eating anything, mother? Jose... I wonder where he is, now. He'd called me. It's all because of his carelessness. Nothing will happen to Jose. Don't worry. Eat something, mother. Hi Catch it Pass it here. This is Salma, my classmate. Sorry, WAS my classmate. Where do you stay, Salma? Kottaram Road. This is my Grandma. I'm Solomon. These are my uncles. We stay in Jawahar Colony. Come, visit us some day. Let's get to know each other better. I will come. Go,go. We were supposed to have some good family-time, today. But this guy has been sniffing ever since he got here. Can't you stop this? You are the only one with a family of your own. You all had (families), too. But you ruined it all. Don't get me started... Aby, let it be. Or he will use it as an excuse to take in more drugs He's just looking for reasons (to do so). We make a living from the money we get from this. Let's not forget that. His lousy advice! One day we will have to stop all of this. That day you won't be able to stop even if you want to. You're right. I'm telling you, too. Musthafa, bring me some water What happened Musthafa? Do you know who I am? Aren't you Jose uncle? Yes Musthafa... Go. How much longer will you have to live hidden like this? It's not a simple crime. You are considered a traitor now. He won't even get bail. What evidence do they have? The weapons that were seized from my vehicle? Isn't that enough? Aren't weapons considered evidence? It's true that I used that car, Bu the RC (of that car) is not in my name. The kids are falling asleep, let's go Don't start nagging while we're are in the middle a serious conversation They will sleep over there, don't worry. Brother...brother...police! Police? Where? Close the door immediately! Brother, get away from here! Solomon, Where? Fooled You! You got me all tensed up We have to buy some groceries. What? We have to do some grocery shopping. We're running out of them. I have to go to the supermarket, anyway. Make a list and hand it over to me. Hurry. I'll be waiting. By the way, why were you going to the supermarket? Just to meet brother Jose. What is he doing in the supermarket if he supposed to be in hiding? What are you guys upto? Nothing much. It's just a small deal Why are you making it small? Make a big one, instead. Haven't I told you not to interfere in these matters Don't you remember -- we have kids. I'm interfering because... What am I supposed to say when they ask me what their father does for a living? That he is a drug dealer? Didn't you know all about this from the very beginning? Haven't I told you everything about my business? You did. But back then, I wasn't mature enough to understand these things. The police visit our house almost everyday looking for Jose. Why do they have to come here? The kids are getting scared, too. Aby, we can work hard together to lead a decent life. Or else... Be patient for a little longer, Daisy. I'm really fed up. I know. This is like a whirlpool I want to get out of this, too. I want to end all of this before our kids start realizing things. You go now. I have work to do. You send me the list on Whatsapp. I have to sneak in and out of places to get meet you Can't we put an end to all this? What are you going do instead? We can invest in the Share Market, maybe? Don't I need to have computer skills for that? I don't know anything about computers. Or we can start some other business. Why do we need to start some other business (when we have this)? Hasn't Dad already established a good business for us? The "medicine" Business? It's called Drug Dealing. Drugs are also medicines. This will do for now Fine. I was only hoping we could clean up our act. Hey -- Any common man do what you've been suggesting. But to be a Gambino -- That's not everyone's cup of tea You need to have guts!. Forget it, if you're not interested. I'm going shopping. I can drop you. Hey You could've seen him if you had come 5 minutes earlier. That won't be necessary. We can make do with you. Let me know when you decide. Okay, I have to go now. Did you tell her? Okay I will call you later Does she know? No, I haven't told her yet. What is this Solomon? This is all fate. What fate are you talking about? Son, Solomon ... Solomon! What are you doing? Where is Mother? She went to big brother's house. Aren't you ashamed to drink beer like girls? I'll do what I like Okay. I have been wanting to ask you something for a while now What is it? Do you have a case going on? Stop beating around the bush and tell me what it is. Don't you have a girlfriend? No. Why not? I don't have the time for relationships. Then, how do you plan to pass your time? By drinking beer? Or by drugging yourself? Hey It's been a week since Aby's death. For him, and for his soul, have we done anything at all? No! Alex. Shouldn't we do something for Alex? Yes, we should! Finish your bath quickly and come I need to go somewhere. I need a car. We have a car here. Hey, you don't tell me what to do. I'll tell you, you just obey. There will be abandoned cars on road. Bring me one of them. And bring it before 11 pm. How can I do all this? You can. This is also an opportunity for you. You will get more opportunities like this, if you can prove yourself. This is how you learn new things. So, I'll see you at sharp 11 pm, Ok? His bloody drugs! We have important things to do! I'm gonna thrash you. Take that too. Where is the car? It is parked behind the house. We will be back soon. If anyone calls, Tell them we all are right here Here. If they ask for us again, tell them that we are in the toilet. Let's go. Come. There is a suspicious car on Thondayadu Bypass Road. Can you please tell us the exact location. It is somewhere on the Thondayadu Bypass Road We are on our way there. Hey You messed with the Gambinos, you bastard! What happened? Why are you alone? Where are the others? Just shut up and go. Get lost! Phone ringing Phone ringing Phone ringing Hey Musthafa I like your hairstyle. At what salon did you get it cut? It's not from a salon. Did you do it yourself? A friend of mine did it. Friend? As in girlfriend? What was her name? I forget Salma Sal...ah It's hard to believe she cuts so well Does she cut for others too? See this hair? I'd like to make it more stylish. She will cut for me if you ask her to. Won't you ask her? After all, I am your Uncle Hey, Mustafa... What is your name? Musthafa I need to clarify a few things with you regarding a murder case Okay Jose..Alex.. Then there's one more person, Who's that? Solomon Yeah, Solomon He's the one who got away. The police is looking for him What is your full name? Mustafa Ahmed And 'Ahmed' is your Father Yes What is your relationship with these people? ..this family? They are my mother's family So Jose and Alex? They are my mothers siblings. What is your mothers name? Aleena Carlos. How is your mother's relationship with them? Does she visit often? No. Even I had no connection with them till mother's death. Has it been long since your mother's death? She passed away last month. She had cancer. Where were you yesterday? At Jose uncle's house. Where did you say they had gone yesterday night? I never said that they did. Then tell me now. Where did they go? They were at home. Okay. How was your relationship with this Aby, who died in a police encounter. He was very friendly. Everyone liked him. What about the other uncles? They are troublemakers, aren't they? That's not what I meant. Aby uncle was a decent guy. Where were you at the time of Aby's death? I was at home with grandmother. How did your uncles react to the news of his death? I'm not sure I understand you. He was shot, right? How did your uncles react to that? They all were very depressed Didn't they want to take revenge on whoever killed Aby? Anyone would react that way, wouldn't they? Only Solomon Uncle created a ruckus. So it must be this Solomon who planned the revenge, right? No. sir. He did create a ruckus. And then he cried a lot. I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Crime Branch D.Y.S.P Pradeep Kumar. He is North C.I, Alex Paul. Have you had anything to eat, Musthafa? Yes sir Ok, we will call you when we need you again. We might have to meet again My being at Aby's house at the time, was the reason for all of this. None of this would've happened if I were home. They were digging their own graves by killing Aby. Couldn't you have said a word about this before you set off? What else were we supposed to do to those who killed Aby? Weren't we supposed to kill those bastards? You tell me. Shouldn't we have done that? He is my Son. He's the one I pampered the most. He came from my womb. So, I should be the one having a grudge against his murderers. A much bigger grudge than any of you. But We are not safe. Jose ... The police already have you on watch. Now they will use this as an excuse to raid the entire house. When your father was alive not a soul had the guts to come near our house. Now his kids... Are living in fear of the cops. You should be able to strike fear in your enemies. Like your father Carlos, did. And that is why they called him 'Gambino' Even that name is tarnished, now. Phone ringing Tell me I am inside Never mind. I will come there. Mother, Solomon is standing outside. I will go and get him. Jose You should go and meet that psychiatrist. And continue your medication. What? Come Solomon, I spoke to the lawyer. That won't work, mother. We can then get you out on bail, son. This is not an ordinary case. It is murder of policemen. They won't go easy on you. You know what will happen if they catch you. You first get an anticipatory bail I cannot go and surrender. But Where is he? That's right -- Alex, where is Musthafa? Do you know cooking? Yes. Sort of I used to help mummy, at times. She was a great cook. And my father was a big time foodie. He loved the fish curry she made. You too have been chatting? Somebody here has been so hungry that he's begun blabbering. Come, let's eat. Salma tells me that you have quit your education and have started looking for a job. Your education is important. Mamma has also been saying that. Yeah The vehicle used for the killing of the cops on Thondayadu Bypass Road seems to be a stolen one. Kerala police are also searching for the car jackers who might have links to this case. Senior police officers tell the media that the culprits will be found at any cost. Family members of the deceased cops will be getting a compensation amount of Rs 10 lakh from the government. How can I help you? Is Musthafa here? He is inside. Tell him Alex has come. Musthafa, A person named Alex has come to see you Why are you here? Hurry up. Let's go. What did they ask you at the police station? Will you be able to recall and tell us everything? Don't leave anything out. Not even a word. They try to trap you using what you said So tell me everything -- word by word. They did not ask too many questions. And what did you tell them? Tell me all about it. They asked me my name. The police tend to re-phrase questions. And ask you things from different angles. We should be careful not to spill the beans. It is only natural that they ask questions. They are doing their duty. We should keep our mouths shut. That is what's ideal for us. Especially in your case. I hope you haven't given them any clues. What was her name again? Whose? The girl you keep hanging out with... Salma Did you share anything with her? No. Are you sure? I haven't said anything I am sure. We should always be careful while sharing secrets with women. They tend to tell it to others. Especially with the police they are sure to blurt it all out. You don't mind not telling her, do you? I haven't said anything till now. It would be better for both if you do not see each other anymore You shouldn't see that girl again Isn't that better? Let all of this get sorted out You don't have to worry He will not see her again Right, son? Fuel for 500 Rupees. Don't make noise and give away your location Solomon. Just Stop. This is the real deal. This is what I have been looking for. I have stopped dealing with weapons. Your father Carlos was the one who brought me into this field. So what? You did make a fortune out of it, didn't you? That is why I agreed to do this. This weapons business is a risky one, Solomon. Didn't you get hefty payments for the risk you took? Just arrange for me to stay here for 2 days. I forgot to tell you something... Who asked you to come here, now? 2 Men had come here yesterday when you were out. Who were they? I don't know They asked if there were any other people living here. I said No. Is there a problem? Was it the cops? I'm not sure. They looked that way though. Might it have been the police? How am I supposed to know whether it was the cops or not? Who turned on this phone? Who would want to do that, now? I had turned it off The police can track and find me if the phone is turned on. Shit! They must be on their way here. I swear I didn't do it, Solomon. Do you have an extra sim card? I don't even have a mobile phone. Useless! Solomon, Don't give up, son *died in a police encounter last week* Geethu, turn up the volume This happened in between an ongoing murder investigation where the police were looking for Solomon, one of the suspects. Solomon died in an encounter with Crime Branch D.Y.S.P Pradeep Kumar and his team. Sir, the Mafia seems to have grown stronger in the city in recent times. Even with the police presence and judicial system we have in place. You are right. There has been a spike in such crimes in the city. Now the responsibility is on my shoulders. Such incidents will not happen again. We've started making movements against them. You will hear more about it in the next few days. Why is this happening to my kids? Jesus, are you keeping me alive in order to see all of this? Didn't we ask him to surrender? But he just wouldn't listen. Now see what's happened. Why are you blaming him alone? So, I am the culprit now? Did I ask him to go into hiding? You speak as if it is all my fault. Of course It was your impatience that lead to this. What do you mean by that? Have you forgotten all about the debt that dad had left us with when he died? We shouldn't forget our past. I single-handedly brought the family into the position we are in, now. What position are you talking about? Having to see my children's blood-soaked bodies? Is that the position you are talking about? Is that the guts you were talking about? They brought that upon themselves. You and your kids lived happily till now, haven't you all? All this time, there have been no words of appreciation. Now all the blame is mine. You should be thankful. What should I be thankful for? Tell me... For giving birth to you? Let's not get started on how you brought us up. Get out. You are a psycho. You...you You are the one who killed my kids. Hey don't talk nonsense. Am I the one who killed them? Don't blame me for their mistakes Enough! Don't say another word. You old fag... Leave Grandma alone. What? Don't hurt Grandma. Hey, who are you to say that? Jose leave him alone. Who the hell are you? Jose let go. Don't say anything. Let me go. Listen to me, Jose. Who the hell are you? No Jose, don't hurt him. Stop there. Stop! What is the issue? Hey it's nothing. We were just playing around. Musthafa is everything ok? He is okay. Aren't you? I'll be taking him with me. I've got to ask him a few things. Sir, if he doesn't co-operate with you, please let me know. I will set him straight. Whatever you want to ask him, you can ask me. I will give you all the answers. That will not be necessary. I will definitely ask you if the need ever arises. I will be able to give you some crucial information regarding the police murders. I am ready to help you in any way possible. Right now I just need him. Musthafa Go I will send the lawyer along with you. Come I will pray that this case be solved as soon as possible. Everything will be settled quickly if your prayers are with us. They are the police. They will try to brainwash you; they have their ways. Don't give them anything. They are doing their duty. That's all. You are my blood relation. Our issues are just temporary. Your mother was a favorite of mine. And you are my Aleena's Son I'll be there for you if you ever need me. Even if it is a life or death situation. I'm ready to spend any amount of money for you, because You are my blood. It is my duty to protect you. Hey I have already asked you this once, I'll repeat myself once more. They were talking about the funeral rites. Did they get very emotional and say anything out of the ordinary? It's normal for any person to get emotional when their brother dies. Why are you silent, Mustafa? Did the lawyer ask you not to say anything? I only need a statement from you. We are looking for answers that could help solve this case, do you understand? He is not a small kid, He understands. Firstly, your understanding of things itself is incorrect. Then how can he give a statement that will help you. And if it is evidence that you want then he or someone else will have to make false evidence for you. Such false evidences and statements won't hold up in court. Am I not right? We'll have to meet again Come. That D.Y.S.P is a tough guy. As of now, they haven't got anything from Mustafa. But this is not forever. They know how to make him talk if they manage to get hold of him alone. You did something very foolish. You shouldn't have sent an amateur like him to steal the vehicle. If he admits to stealing the car, then we will be finished. Why did you send him to steal that car? Why? I had asked Alex to do it Nobody told me anything. I had told you to do it first. Jose, you had told him to do it. Now don't blame me when there is an issue. This is his problem. You could've stolen that vehicle. You didn't listen to me and made him steal the vehicle. That lead to all these issues I made him do it? Yeah Alex, that is the cause of all of this. What are you saying, Jose? You should've gone and stolen the vehicle but you never listen. That is the problem. Stop. Stop. Stop. I didn't call you both here to argue. Tell that to him. Hey Now you understand, right? Alex, no matter who did it, it was a stupid mistake. What can we do now? Musthafa! The whole case now lies with him. We should always keep an eye on him. Always. Do you understand? Yes. Alex, Where would he be, now? He is always at that girl's house. Perfect! I had told you guys that. To him, as well as you. He will never see her again! What is it? Is Mustafa here? Yes he is. Can you please call him? Musthafa... Why did you come? Didn't we tell you to never come here? And not to meet her ever again? What wrong with my meeting her? You can meet her. But after this issue is resolved. Haven't we told you? What is the connection between this and the case? I don't understand. You only need to understand this much for now. Have you forgotten what the lawyer said? He doesn't have any right to interfere in my personal matters. I don't know anything about that but this is something that affects our family. It's better that you do as you are asked to. You've got a call. Say I'm busy. They said it's important. Salma, just go inside. Can't you see that we are discussing something here. What a time for a call! Come, let's go. There should be no contact with her henceforth. This is what I can't understand... Why should I keep my life on hold? I have nothing to do with this case. This is your problem. So please don't drag me into this. Please leave. I will go. If you think we are the only ones who will be affected by this case. You are wrong. You are the one who stole the car that night. The murder took place inside that car. The only evidence that the police has in this case, is that car. So even you are damned. There's no doubt about that. If you love her sincerely stay away from her until this issue is solved. Or else she will also be trapped in all of this. One more thing -- None of your plans will work. You have tonight to think again, and make you decisions regarding her. Salma, Why aren't you responding? If you want me to respond to us never meeting again, then I have nothing to say about that. Why don't you tell me why you're doing this? That is our family matter. How did this family matter suddenly pop up out of nowhere? Or did you make it all up just to get rid of me? It's just for a while, I promise. Then we will meet again Let me discuss this with Mamma. Till then please do as I say. Since you have already made up your mind, I have nothing to say I'm leaving. By the way, I will also have to think about this decision to not meet each other. Salma, please sit down. Please sit Salma, this is what is best for you. Best for me? I don't understand. Tell me what it is. What? Now you have nothing to say? You are not what I thought you were. You will pay for toying with my feelings. Just wait and see. What is it? What's the problem? Girlfriend? No need to tell if it's a secret. You have to come with me now. Please leave me alone. The vehicle is downstairs. Come and get in. I just told you I can't come in this situation. Whatever the situation you might be, remember this is a call from the Crime Branch D.Y.S.P. What will you do if I don't come? I'll force you into the vehicle. That's what I usually do. And by your look I know that you are the obedient type. If you try to disobey. We will have to bring your girlfriend into the investigation. That's how the police work. So are you coming or do you want to trouble her too? I'll come. Then come Is Musthafa home? What is it? I just wanted to meet him. Can you please call him? Yeah Come inside. Be seated. Never mind. Can you please hurry? No problem. Sit. Isn't mamma here? She's gone out. Then I will come back later. Hey sit. Let me call him. Sit. I'll be right back. Why have you brought me here? Believe me, it is for your safety Come. I called him. Here, No. Thank You. I'll come and meet Mustafa some time later. It's okay. Sit. I called him. He said he is almost here. How can I not offer anything to our guest. Drink this. Have it. Mustafa is very young. Don't hesitate to ask me for any help you may need. Okay? I am ready to do anything. Drink it. Has he told you anything about us? Specifically, has he said anything recently? Has he? No. Salma, Shall I tell you a fact? You are really gorgeous. Especially your eyes. Take your hands off me Did the police ever come to your house? Didn't you hear me? Has the police ever come there? Tell me! What did you tell them? Did you tell them anything that Mustafa told you? Tell me...tell me! I'm asking you -- Don't act smart with me. Tell me the truth. So you won't tell me, huh? You don't have to tell. Jose, Jose. Even if you wish to say, I won't allow you to. Jose, let go. Shut up! Let it all end with you. Let it end. Let it end. let it end! Hey Mustafa Ask him to have breakfast and get ready I'll wait outside. Musthafa, Have you ever thought about these trees? They offer shade to several living creatures. But if their branches spread to our homes or electric posts, we cut them without any mercy. Criminals have to be treated the same way. When they start affecting the peace and goodness in the society, we use the law to take them down. That's our duty as the police. The many things one does right is what forms the foundation of his life. But one misdeed can ruin it all. As long as they aren't caught they keep repeating the same wrong-doings Finally when they begin to realize that they will get caught, they start erasing the evidence. Businessmen, Politicians, Celebrities ... All kinds of people. Take the case of your own uncles... They used political power and money to get away from all the cases against them. They think it will always work. But the final victory -- That will always be that of the truth. And only the truth! Now they might be feeling that they are strong. Do you think they will protect you? They will betray you. They will get rid of you when they feel you are in their way. Just a small decision of yours will do. We can beat a much greater wrong. If you have unknowingly committed any mistake I can keep you protected you by making you a witness. I know your situation. All I can do is advice. You are the one who has to decide. Why are you telling me all this? I don't know anything. I'm leaving. Where were you yesterday? I.. Was at Salmas house. Was there an occasion? How's Salma doing? Fine Phone ringing Don't run..Stop Hey, stop there. Musthafa Hey -- Shit! Where are the car keys? Hey, where are the car keys? I haven't seen them. One can't find anything in this house! What? What is it? Mother, where are the car keys? It must be somewhere around here. Move. Just move aside. Always making silly excuses. Can't find it anywhere! Jose, Shouldn't it be there? Hey, Where is that girl's house? Which girl? Salmas. Where is Salma's house? Don't you already know that? Hurry up and tell me where it is. Didn't we both go together. Just answer my question. No need to interrogate me. What happened to you, Jose? Hey shut up. Just tell me, bastard! Tell me. Tell me. Where is Salma's house? Where is Salma? She is not here. Where did she go? She went to her aunt's house yesterday. She's not been answering calls. Take a seat. Uncle, could I use the toilet? Sure. Go ahead. Phone ringing Phone ringing Hey, hurry up and leave that house. Jose is on his way there. Hurry up and leave that place. Can you hear me? Uncle, I need a favour-- What is it? I need to go to the town urgently. Come Hey, stop there. Hey. You! Hey! Stop! Is that how you cut vegetables? You're falling asleep over them. Put it in this. Here, this is a special preparation. Taste it and tell me how it is. It's good, sir. Take it off the stove in 5 minutes. I'll just take a shower and come. Don't fall asleep, now. We're not getting bail as expected. The court has already rejected the bail twice. You are not putting in enough efforts. How can you say that? Do you think I won't do my best? Things are getting out of hand. The high Court is our last hope. High Court or Supreme Court. You must throw in some more money, if you need to. Change the lawyer if you have to. Don't get tensed, son. The lawyer is not a problem. I need to get out of here. And fast. Do whatever is necessary to make that happen. By hook or crook. Understand? Alex Why are you so silent? Why aren't you talking to mother? Whose death are you mourning? Jail and court are meant for real men. Enough! Now don't start arguing. You've always thought of me as a squabbler. After all, I grew up watching you and dad fight. Just get lost without creating a scene here. I am out of here. It's because of you that everyone is suffering today. I decide whether to bring you out or not. I am your mother. You should remember that. Son, Say something -- Why did you ask me to come? We have to do something about his case. If you're talking about Musthafa, then it's risky. Because he is the sole witness in this case. If something happens to him in their custody then it will be a huge headache for all of us. Not just that, he is in their secret hideout. And it's hard to find it. He is in this address. This is a huge risk. Is there anything else we can do? There are chances we could get a bail. Only a chance? You cannot guarantee it, can you? How did you get this address that is known only to the police? Narendran, I've been seeing all this ever since Carlos was running the business I've been playing this game for quite some time now. Even when Carlos got shot, I never gave up. It is for these children that I stayed strong. What I'm saying is -- If anyone comes between my kids and me, I will do away with them! But, Musthafa... Musthafa! He's gone. Not just from my house. But also from my heart. Don't expect anything of him anymore. One time, she chose her path, leaving the family behind. His mother, I mean. Now, he follows in her footsteps. There is no point in trying to fix what cannot be mended. Nothing is more important to me than my kids. If the lord decides Mustafa should be sacrificed in order to save my kids, then, so be it. To me, my kids are more important than my grandkids. Even if they are biggest scoundrels. I cannot think of a life without them. This puts my career at risk. No matter what you offer, I won't put my career at risk and join you. You should've raised them properly. You and your kids alone, must have to suffer the consequences. You cannot burden us with into your issues and then leave us stranded. The main evidence of this case is the gun used to commit the murder. Forget the police, even the military won't be able to find it. And that car that is in their custody -- Even though the car belongs to someone else, It was stolen by Musthafa. He is also considered a witness in Salma's murder If he opens up about all of these, to the police, Then, we will all end up behind bars. Not all of us, just your kids. Only them. Isn't that right? It might be right. You know the share you have in the various deals with my kids. Don't forget all that, Sudhakaran. Do you have any evidence to prove that? Your thinking that I don't have evidence, doesn't mean the evidence doesn't exist. Correct? Mustafa had once accompanied Solomon for a deal with you ... Are you trying to blackmail me? I hadn't thought of it that way, until now. I need my children out of prison For that I will do whatever it takes No matter how gruesome the means have to be. I need some time to think. Go ahead, think. Take your time. You have time until dawn to think. Then it's time to act. You know me very well, Sudhakaran I'm not like my children. I never thought I would have to see my kids in this condition. As prisoners. Musthafa? Come in, son. Who is that? She's our neighbour. Grandma, please come with me. Why? I need to tell you something. Sure, we can speak. Don't get tensed. Mamma will take care of you, okay? Now you must've understood that police custody is not exactly safe. You stay with Grandma. She needs a helping hand at this time. And you don't have to be scared of your uncles either. What problem do you have here anyway? It is natural to have uncles and nephews having tussles and then working it out. It happens in every family. For me, you all are equally important. I won't let anything happen to you while I'm alive. I am Advocate Arundathi Menon. Aren't you Mustafa? Yes. Where were you till now? Come with me. Tell me, where were you? I was just staying away for a while. We arrested the guy who came to attack you Why didn't you call me? I lost my phone during the incident. Did you meet anyone while you were gone? No Musthafa, I'm in a lot of tension. We will know the verdict of the case today. They must have told you most of the things. Now all you have to do is support them. Leave the rest to your conscience. You have the freedom to decide things yourself. A single statement can decide the outcome of a case in court. Many things are in our favour, in this case. Now it's your statement that is going to turn things around. Every word you speak in court is like a fired weapon. Just one mistake and it will turn against us. Then it will be used as evidence by the prosecution. Then they will have to continue as prisoners without ever getting bail. The prosecution has no solid witness other than you. Similarly only you can save your uncles. Musthafa, I know you loved her a lot. There's nothing we can do about what has happened. If it will make you feel any better -- your mother and Salma are in God's care, now. Now all you have left in this world are your Grandmother and your Uncles. The Police need you only until the judgement of this case is passed. Policemen are like that -- They will forget you once the case is over. Then they will replace you with another person for another case. You are disposable. They grow in their ranks by using people like you, as pawns. The standing of the prosecution depends on your decision, Musthafa. You have to listen to your conscience. Maybe, When you tell the truth you lose a few things in life. But you will never have to feel guilty for standing up for the truth. Sometimes we'll have to hide some facts Because Sharing them with the society will not bring back the people that we lost. Do this for the sake of your deceased mother. You will be helping her brothers. And as a result, I will get back my kids. It's a mother's humble request. They are culprits. And they deserve the punishment for that. I trust you. You are not like them. You cannot become like them. In order to win the case I will ask you in court whether Salma was a drug addict. And you should say that she was. Then I will ask you If you were aware of her illicit relationships with other men. Even for that you should say, Yes. As for the reason of her death, it has been proven that she overdosed. It's in the post-mortem report. Isn't this such a big insult to the entire Kerala Police Department, Sir? Do you think you did the right thing? This is the victory of truth. How many innocent people are being punished in this country! This judgement is a befitting reply to the arrogance of the police. The trust in our Judicial system has been restored once again. They turned my grandson into a false witness. They threatened him and forced him to give a fake statement. Not falling for their threats, he told the truth. The police has a habit of arresting innocents when they fail to find the actual culprits. The plans of those who are jealous of my children's stature, have been shattered here. Sir, please sit there. I need to take a closeup shot. You can say anything you like... Pack all this up and leave this place immediately! Or I will throw all this away Sir How are you? Were you able to find the actual culprits? I hope you will be able to find them soon and bring them to justice. Mine and my family's prayers will always be there with you. Don't be fooled thinking you are very smart. Maybe this case will also rust and remain unsolved, just like many other cases in the country. Just maybe. You can never escape from your own conscience. It will follow you till your death. I hope you have this same level of self confidence when we meet next. That is my prayer for you. How are you and your mother? We are doing fine. Ok, Jose. Hey, Mamma ... Musthafa Where were you till now, son? I got a job in an I.T company, nearby. That's really good news. You should stay with us. We have kept your room intact. Where is everybody? They have gone to church. They'll be back soon. Come in. Alex, just call and inform them. Okay. Mother, I'm right here Did you pray well? Yes I did. Whole heartedly. Mustafa is here. Oh is he? You go and bring him down for lunch. Okay, I will bring him. Hey, Mustafa. Why are you sitting here? Long time! Son, Life is unpredictable. We expect something Not knowing that something else awaits us.
