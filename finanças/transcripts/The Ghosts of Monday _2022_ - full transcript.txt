(dramatic orchestral music) (footsteps falling) (foreboding music) (people conversing) (foreboding music) (engines roaring) (suspenseful music) [Anna] I'm a big fan of your show. I've never missed an episode. [Eric] Thank you. You'll find plenty of material to work with here. Sea serpents, sirens, myths and legends of ancient gods, and loads of ghosts. Good job. Looks like you've done your homework. That's what you hired me for. First time in Cypress? Yeah, but Sofia was born here. Really? Where? (dramatic instrumental music) This place was abandoned for over two decades. The locals are terrified to go near it. Welcome to the Gula Hotel. (eerie music) (wind blowing) (plastic flapping) Shall we go inside? Great. (wind blowing) (foreboding music) [Anna] It's all yours. We're spending a fortune on renovations. (eerie music) What about the crew? [Anna] They're here. Great. (dramatic instrumental music) (woman screaming) (bell tolling) Come to Cyprus and go to the beach. It's never cold there. How was I supposed to know we'd get the only shit week of the year? Well, at least it stopped raining. Jennifer. Christine. Your director's here. - Jennifer. - Hi. - Glad you came. - Of course. It's gonna be a fun week. Uh huh. Let me introduce you to the best sound tech on the island. Probably because I'm the only sound tech on the island. - London. - Dublin. Much better. Eric, what do you think of this for the location for the interviews? I don't know. I'm not sure yet. And stylistically, how did you want to shoot the show. I was told you're good at handheld. She's the queen of shaky cam. (laughs) Well. Okay, let's take a look around. See how good you are. (eerie music) (Anna's voice muffled by flashback voices) Mrs. Lindstrom? Look, Anna. Call me Sofia. Yes. Sorry. Sofia. Let me show you the production office. (eerie music) (plaster crashes) Ah! Jesus. You okay? These guys should be more fucking careful. Who the fuck was that? Been here since yesterday and haven't seen a single person yet. Local holiday, maybe. Okay, why don't we move someplace? Yeah, I'm not trying to die today. (coughs) (eerie music) (low growling) (eerie music) Sweetie. How are you? Fine. So happy to see you. Oh, you look wonderful. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. How's your mother? She's okay. She finally got over you. I may have been a shitty father, but one thing's for sure. I was an even shittier husband. (both chuckle) It feels weird to be back here after all this time. Oh, you'll get used to it. It'll be good for you. Now we're all together again. Are you ready to meet our hosts? Sure. What are they like? [Bruce] An interesting couple. Well, the original Grand Hotel Gula was a typical Victorian building. It was built in 1880 during the first few years of the British occupation. According to the locals, this place is cursed. Why do they think that? The area's been infamous since the days of Richard the Lionheart, but a lot of people were killed here before that. Thousands. But the British didn't care. The beach is beautiful and the location was excellent, so they built us the best hotel on the island. My wife used to come here all the time when she was younger. They would throw some wonderful parties. I never imagined I'd own it one day. I just couldn't believe it when Frank suggested we buy it. It's a dream come true, isn't it, darling? It seemed like a good investment, but we couldn't get any locals to work here because of what happened, so we had to ship laborers in. Tell us about the hotel's gruesome reputation. It was New Year's Eve, 1990. A Monday. It was, in fact, the 53rd Monday of the year, something that happens rarely. There was a party for about a handful of guests, the cream of the island, but... The food was poisoned. Rat poison. To this day, nobody knows how it got in there. There was a big scandal and a high-level investigation, but nothing ever came of it. Yes. Every single one of the guests died right there and then. In agony, apparently. And the very same night, the hotel's owners committed suicide. The place was closed down, and since then, the locals say it's haunted. None of this put you off when you thought of buying the place? No, like I said, it seemed like a good investment, and back then, there was no hint of any spirits. Well, we can fix that. [Eric] What do you mean? Well, we'll have a ghost in the background of the interview. Dim the lights, do a few tricks in the editing room, and, look, this chap. He could play a ghost. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Tell me I misunderstood. Look, over three seasons, we've never found any evidence of paranormal activity. It's time to try something different. Think about it. Let's use some of that old-style carnie showmanship. Audiences love it. You know what? Fuck you. Eric, are you out of your mind? No, we're done. Show's over. Look, Eric. Relax. It was a joke. Oh, that was a joke? Well, bad timing, Bruce. I don't know what the fuck you're thinking. I'm sorry. Let's call it a day. You guys get some rest, and we'll talk about it tomorrow. Goodnight. Eric. Eric, you are a professional. Anna. You need to calm down. [Anna] Yes? (creature growling) Could you take us to the hotel now, please? This is the hotel. You mean we're staying here? Your rooms are on the fifth floor. It's the only one that's fully refurbished. Boris took your bags up earlier. Why didn't you tell me this before? Okay. Forget about it. Can you show us up, please? (eerie music) [Sofia] Odd, isn't it? It looks old and modern at the same time. Our hosts have a singular taste, I'll tell you that. [Sofia] He loves to screw around. I know, but I think he enjoys winding me up. I'm in Room 506. Goodnight. Goodnight. (eerie music) (footsteps falling) (dramatic foreboding music) What a feast. It was so delicious. Thank you very much. Bless you. You're welcome. Well, it's time for us to turn in. We wish you a splendid night here at the Hotel Gula. Sweet dreams. Do you fancy a drink? No, thanks. It's a little late for me. You sure? Yeah. Goodnight. Would you like a drink? Maybe tomorrow. Mr. McPherson. We've already been over this. Well, Anna, sometimes a drink is just a drink. Please, let us keep things professional. Then call me Bruce. (suspenseful music) Ding-dong. Are you sure you wouldn't like that drink? Bye. (suspenseful music) (dramatic emotional music) (people conversing) (dramatic emotional music) (door rattles) (eerie music) (people conversing) (suspenseful music) How did I get here? It's okay. You still taking those pills? No. I don't. Bye. Bye. You all right? (suspenseful music) Welcome. Sorry we are late. We both had a rough night. I'm sorry to hear that. Come on. Let's get you guys something to eat. Thank you so much. Where's Bruce? He called to say he couldn't make it. Yeah, he also told us about last night. Sometimes, I just don't get him. Look, if it's about money, you know- - Dom, it's, it's not about the money. But I understand you're not happy with the take Bruce has on the show. Look, I respect the man, but our careers are at stake here. And exactly what career are you talking about now? [Christine] What are we going to do now? Maybe we should start looking for a new job. I'm sure Bruce will still hire me, hmm? Ah, switching teams now. Traitor. Wait, wait, did you hear that? Go back. (rough breathing) Turn it up. That's not good. (rough breathing) (suspenseful music) May I? I'm sorry about Dom. Sometimes he can be very blunt, but you know, Frank and Rosemary, they've spent all their savings on that place. It means the world... Yeah, I know that. They're nice people. A bit old-fashioned, yes but... their heart is in the right place. Let's give them a hand. Help them attract tourists. Pat, you're absolutely right. Don't let the smell put you off. It'll do you good. What is it? It's made from locally-grown herbs. It'll put you to sleep. Can we please forget about before? I want to do whatever it takes to get this show made. Well, this calls for a celebration, then. Okay. I like it. Sofia. You want to walk back through the old town? Sure. Great. (gentle music) (eerie music) (metal rattling) (cats hissing) (both laughing) I'm sorry for all the screwups, for all the stupid things that I did and didn't do. I should have thought about you instead of my career. I've really missed you all these months. (eerie music) I missed you, too. You are very cute, you know that? Those circles under your eyes make you look like a panda. Fuck you. (laughs) That's better. I've always loved your smile. (Sofia laughing) (Eric laughing) Always happens. (eerie music) Pat called. She sounded happy. I'm glad you sorted things out. Yeah, it's all good now. Why don't we meet in the morning and have a chat over breakfast? I'm going to go talk to Bruce. I'll see you all tomorrow. Let me give you a drink. (liquid sloshes) if the pilot works, we have ourselves a show. If not, we go home. You know this business. I just want to deliver a good show. Let me rephrase that. I have got to deliver a good show. I don't want this to be some cheap carnival spook house series. Neither do I, Eric. (emotional music) How long since you last saw her? Since you lost the baby, right? I'm worried about her. She doesn't seem to be getting any better. She's not working. The network isn't interested. She's only here because I insisted. This is your chance to patch things up. I know you still have feelings for her. If you quit now, you lose her for good. (glasses clink) (foreboding music) (creature screeching) Doing your homework? Yeah. Oh, before I forget, this is the master key. It activates all the doors and elevators to the hotel. Great. And here you have all the local legends. This area used to be dominated by the Cult of Teshub. The locals worshiped him and sacrificed their own people. - Why? - Killing was an honor, a way of giving thanks to him. Teshub prevented the world's destruction by defeating his own kin, the serpent. That's really impressive, Anna. Right now, I'm just intrigued by these ghost stories that made this place so unpopular. Right. I'll leave you to it. Okay. (eerie music) May I borrow my daughter for a second? How well do you know them? I met them when I first came to the island many years ago. Sweet couple. I don't like them. Something is going on. Nothing's going on. Don't lie to me. Sofia, I'm telling the truth. You know that I love you. I only want what's best for you. I know you do, but everything seems so strange. There's always someone, something watching us. All I ask is that you trust me and all will be well. I promise. I promise. (somber suspenseful music) [Jennifer] Yeah? Hey, boss. What's going on? Bruce has put together a new script. Pat and Dom adore it, so we move forward. What did he have in mind? He wants to do a few magic tricks to add a little mystery to our show. That's a totally different show. I don't think that's a good idea. You don't? You're not the director. Let's get started. Bring your camera. Men. You're not the director. (laughs) (Jennifer groans) Eric, what's going on? I had an idea. We're gonna shoot something now. (ominous music) Sorry for before. I didn't mean to be a prick. Just under a bit of pressure at the moment. No worries. What are you guys filming? Oh, it's just an establishing shot. They literally never leave the hotel. Christine, would you mind going in and calling Bruce? Good evening and welcome to the first episode of "Ghosts of the Old World." I'm your host, Bruce McPherson, and tonight we're at the Grand Hotel Gula, Cyprus. No one has stayed in this hotel since that fateful Monday when a hundred people died in this room then the three owners shot themselves. After that, many strange things happened, and we're here to investigate. Who are you? Don't be afraid. Speak to me. (eerie music) (Boris snarls) (Bruce yells) (eerie music) On my fuckin' God. To quote Sherlock Holmes, "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth." Cut. Great. [Bruce] How was that? It was great. And the ghost? The ghost was great. Perfect. Thank you. Good job. Jennifer. Just gonna need you to stay on Bruce for as long as you can. I want you to whip left just as late as possible, all right? You're the boss. I'm not. How do we feel? We love it. Love it. Great. Bruce, I think that's some of your best work. Thank you. All right, everybody. Let's go again. We'll go over another one straight away, all right? This is what we have to do. (suspenseful music) [Pat] Sofia? What happened? I don't know, I... Careful, careful. (creature chittering) [Pat] Sofia? (creature chittering) (suspenseful music) I'll go upstairs for the doctor. Let her breathe. (suspenseful music) Bruce isn't back yet. No. Tonight's events have shaken her up a little. She'll be fine. Some rest, I'm sure of it. (Eric shushing) It's okay. She needs a doctor. There you go. The doctor is in the house. Drink this, my dear. Everything will be all right now. I'm here to take of you. What is it? It smells really awful. Just some local herbs. Calms nerves. Frank and I swear by it. It does smell pretty awful, I'll admit, but believe me when I tell you it works miracles. That's your medical opinion, is it? I'm retired now, but I spent many years working as a general practitioner. She's in good hands, young man. There you go, my dear. Get some sleep, and in the morning, you'll feel like a new person. (suspenseful music) It wasn't a dream. [Eric] What do you mean? The night my parents died, I was here. How's that even possible? I don't know. I was a kid, but it's coming back to me. What else do you remember? (eerie music) [Pat] Should we be worried? No, she'll be fine. Glass of wine? I'm good. I trust we'll soon have a good reason to toast. Never turn down a good glass of wine. (foreboding music) Make mine a double. I'll take a rain check. I'd better go prepare tomorrow's schedule. I think I know where that noise is coming from. You heard (indistinct). If you start to wonder anything, you can tell me. Let's drink to our generous hosts and the success of our show. Prost, my friends. Cheers. (darkly emotional piano music) (eerie music) when we laid the foundations for this place, we found evidence of a mass burial. - Really? - Mm. Thousands of people were sacrificed to the god Teshub, according to some local scholars. Oh, we should put that in the show. I mean, that's TV gold. I'm okay with ghosts, but ritual human sacrifice? No, thanks. Well, it's time we were off to bed. I don't think I could sleep after that. I could keep your company, if you wish. Goodnight, Bruce. Well, won't anyone stay for a drink? You know what? Why not? It's okay, my dear. Just don't be too late. Don't worry. He's in good hands. (eerie music) (Sofia gasps) Sofia, what's wrong? It was so real. More like a memory than a dream. There was someone there with me. What was it? I don't know. I couldn't see them. It felt evil. I can feel its presence here. Really scared. Don't leave me. I won't leave you, ever again. Promise. Okay, this really is the last one. I understand, Frank. I'm serious, Bruce. I'm done with all this. Hang on just a little longer. Please. Okay. (eerie music) (shower water pounding) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (door closing) (foreboding music) You have no idea how much I miss you. Sometimes it just feels like I'm in a Woody Allen film. The director's a nice guy. It's just that he seems really stressed out. No, she's his ex-wife. There's something, there's something about her. Fuck. I'll have to call you back. (phone clicking) (phone buzzing) (suspenseful music) What are you doing here? Why didn't you tell them? You were here that night, weren't you? (foreboding music) You always do this. Look, (metal pounding) I just want to be taken seriously on a job. (knife sinking) (Anna gasping) (elevator bell dings) And what's the excuse for your parents? (Anna crying out) My parents didn't support my decision, so I'm sorry if I'm not dying for you to meet them. (Anna screaming) Anyway, I'm going to go and figure out what that sound was. It's the middle of the night. [Christine] Yeah. (blood spurts) (elevator beeping) (suspenseful music) (Anna calling out) (knife striking) (Anna gasping) (creepy music box music) (phone buzzing) (eerie vocalizing) What's the rush? Have you seen Anna? No. We're supposed to meet here. Then I'm sure she's on her way. Have a drink with me. (Eric scoffs) Not a good idea. Tomorrow. Work, work, work. Same old Eric. Don't be such a prick. Prick? (laughs) Okay. I want to talk to you by something, anyway. (eerie music) Anna? (knocks) Anna. There is no sign of her. At last, I'm in her room, and she's not here. All right. Where the fuck is she? (creature breathing heavily) (foreboding music) [Christine] This gives me the creeps. Me, too. Let's look around. - Did you see that? - No. Let's get the hell out of here. Don't you want to find out what's making that sound? To tell you the truth, I don't care anymore. (creature breathing heavily) (foreboding music) (metal banging) (women call out) We need to get the fuck out of here. (women screaming) (creature snarling) (women screaming) It won't open. God. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, come on! Come on, go! Christine! Hurry up. Come on. Wait, I'll hold the lift. [Christine] Wait. Christine, what are- - [Christine] No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Shit. Oh, God. Shit. (somber music) (foreboding music) (Christine panting) (creature growling) (Christine screaming) (suspenseful music) (phone beeping) (creature breathing heavily) (skin burning) (Christine moaning) (creature breathing heavily) (foreboding music) (phone beeping) (Christine moaning) Hello? Christine? (Christine sobbing) Christine? (metal sliding) (Christine screaming) (creature snarling) (Christine screaming) (suspenseful music) (water splashing) (Christine panting) (foreboding music) (Christine screaming) (Christine screaming) (water splashing) (invalid number tone) Oh, come on. (phone ringing) Eric, where the fuck are you? What's going on? Something happened to Christine. I need your help. Where are you? [Jennifer] I don't know. Blue corridor? I'm on my way. [Sofia] Eric. Where are you going? I won't be long. I promise. Don't open the door to anybody. (foreboding music) (doorknob clicking) (banging on door) [Dom] Ssh, relax. What are you doing here? It's okay. Don't be scared. We only want the best for you. (suspenseful music) (elevator bell dings) (eerie music) Jennifer. Where's Christine? She's in the basement, too. She was- - The fuck is she doing in the basement? Look, come on. The elevator wasn't working. Let's take the stairs. Wait a minute. There's a master key in the office. Doesn't anyone ever sleep in this hotel? Christine's gone. What do you mean, gone? I don't know. We, we were in the boiler room filming something, and we got- Well, what were you filming? [Jennifer] I-I'm not sure, I- - Well, show me. I need to see it. First, we get Christine. Remind me to fire this little cunt tomorrow. (phone chirps) (eerie music) (phone chirps) (eerie music) Where the fuck is it? I can't find the key. Gotta be here. Shit, they're gone. What's gone? Two of the files. It was a file with the guest list and one with the name of the victims. Well, maybe she took them home. Wait a second. I've seen that before. In the basement, I saw it on the wall. It's an ancient symbol for Teshub, an ancient god. What's that got to do with Christine? I read an article about a sect that used to make sacrifices to this Teshub right here on the island. You mean human sacrifices? The article mentioned sheep. Come on, guys. What is this crap? Show me the footage. You're not as good as I thought. Fuck you. I think it's just a rat or something. Yeah, right. Rats don't slither. Right there. See that thing on the wall? Now, can we please go get Christine? I think we should go downstairs. (switches clicking) Great, not working. There's nothing here. Could she have gone down there? That's where we came from. I'm sure she's okay. Oh my God. A treasure from the cellar. (eerie music) Frank, have you seen Christine? Why don't you guys go on? I'm sure she's fine. Seriously? Thanks, Bruce. Get fucked. (foreboding music) We came down here. Christine. Something's different. The sound's gone. Where is she? [Eric] You sure you guys were here? [Jennifer] Yeah. Look. Looks like it was done recently. What are you going to do with that? Move a little to your right. (wall crumbling) You all right? Yeah. Whoa. Looks like this is some kind of archive. This place is thousands of years old. Look at this. Holy shit. It's a plan of the hotel from 1880. Looks like there's a whole other floor. You get access to it through the kitchen. Look at this. How is that possible? That's Frank and Rosemary. It can't be them. It's them. (eerie music) We left Frank with Bruce. Go! Maybe they went back upstairs? It's Sofia's cell phone. (intense music) Run! Run! (Jennifer shouts) (pots clashing) (strike landing) (men struggling) (blows landing) (intense music) (fighters groaning) (intense music) (eerie music) (panting) (eerie music) (moaning) Fuck. (women grunting) (shouting inarticulately) (intense music) (Pat gasping) (intense music) (Jennifer coughing) (suspenseful music) [Jennifer] Fuck. (suspenseful music) [Eric] Where is Sofia? And Christine? You don't have a fucking clue, do you? What did you do to Sofia and Christine? You're about to meet her now. (eerie music) (Jennifer speaks indistinctly) [Jennifer] Ah, fuck. Go, go, go. (suspenseful music) (creature rasping) [Creature] They're here. (Jennifer groaning) (suspenseful music) (creature growling) (suspenseful music) [Jennifer] Just leave her. (suspenseful music) (knife plunging) Do it! (gasping) (knife plunging) (Jennifer moaning) (knife plunging) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (intense music) (knife plunging) (Jennifer gasping) (eerie music) (sibilant vocalizing) (groaning) (eerie music) (flesh slithering) (creature snarling) (suspenseful music) (screaming) Sofia, just fight. (creature growling) (suspenseful music) (fighters grunting) (intensifying music) (calling out) (women screaming) (creature panting) Eric, you don't know what you're doing. What the fuck are you doing to her? (eerie music) You remember now. You remember when we first met. She's chosen you. Chosen for what? What are you talking about? If you accept your role, you can live with Sofia here for centuries, but you will never leave this place ever. Bruce, if you don't move, I will fucking kill you. Eric, you haven't understood a thing. We don't venerate Teshub. We contain her. She is part of all religions and goes by many names. Lucifer, Kali, Molech. We are leaving here. If you do, the world will end. The sun will die. I'll take my chances. (creature squealing) Don't do it! Eric. (sobs) (eerie music) There's no way out for any of us.
