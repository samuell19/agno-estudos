Are you happy to be going to England with your dad? No! So why are you going? Turn down that radio. Come on! Is your name Baffo because you have a mustache? Right. And if you cut them, what would you do, change your name? Don't ask stupid questions. But you told me your name is Baffo because you wear a mustache. Would you switch it off, eh? Would you switch it off? What's your job? I dedicate myself to laughter. I make others laugh. I'm a humorist. No one would ever guess. Look, I've come for you to your grandparents' just to do a favor for your father. Do you understand? If you're angry with your father because you don't want to go to London... you should have it with him. Is that clear? Don't you dare, or else I'll make you get out, eh? I'd like to see that. I'll make you get out! But if you make me get off, then you'll have to come back to pick me up. Get out. Get out! I'm warning you, I'll really get out. Get out. Should I get out? Get out. Get out! THIS LOCATION IS SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL SEQUESTRATION. ACCESS FORBIDDEN. They wanted to shut us up. They hate us because we sell more copies than the Osservatore Romano... which has been published for 119 years when we're publishing for just two months. Ten editions and eight were seized. And why two numbers were not seized? Was its content less aggressive? On the contrary, they were so aggressive that their circulation was exhausted in a few hours. When the minions were set in motion, there was nothing left to seize. And so, in anger, they have closed us. And... almost kicking us out of the editorial room. Do you hear the phone ringing? This morning, before the sequestration, we had a call from Beijing. From Beijing? And who was it? It was wrong number. What do you intend to do now? Baffo. Eh, a consult with the judiciary. Have you prepared a speech? Baffo. What? What do I want? Where is my son? I dropped him off, he's not going to London. Come on, it's no time to joke. I'll miss the plane. Take it easy, you can go without him. Aren't you glad? You can go to London with Milena, all alone. Don't get angry. Can you tell me where you left him? I don't know. I have things to do. Hang on, the plane leaves in two hours. Where did you leave Eugenio? I left him on the roadside. I have things to do, look what a mess I have here. But now we go find him, eh? But do you remember where you left him? Not, not at all. It's all the same around here. Which side? Near Rome, or closer to the grandparents' house? Closer to Rome. Then we head back. Are you carrying a child? ~ What? ~ Who are you carrying? ~ Nobody. ~ But how can it be nobody? You were traveling with the siren on. We're going pick up a woman in labor. But he seemed like a smart kid. ~ Who? ~ Eugenio! Of course he's a smart kid. Now you'll see --- while we're still looking for him out here, he'll have gotten home hitchhiking. Go, make a phone call. Do I fill it up? Yes. Listen, have you by chance seen a boy about ten years old, on his own, about this tall? No. Hello? No! But isn't Baffo bringing him? Yes, he left him on the roadside. Sorry, can I have a white wine? For no reason at all. He hadn't done nothing. You stay there. I'll call you every half hour. Yes, yes, fine. He hasn't arrived. ~ You'll see...he'll show up. ~ And in the meantime, we miss the plane. But you, did you really have such a great need to take him with you to England? To begin with, we'll find where you put him down. Come on, now. Stop, stop! ~ Are you sure it's here? ~ I think so. But you're not sure of anything! Only when you shit are you sure. Yes, yes. Yes, I'm sure. I remember this milestone. ~ Km 9. Here. ~ Eugenio! Eugenio! Eugenio! Eugenio! Come on, show yourself! But where could he have gone? Eugenio! Do not call him anymore, come on. Eugenio! Do not call him anymore, do you think he'd stay out here in the rain? And you had to leave him right here? But it wasn't raining when I left him. Eugenio! ~ But what could have happen to him? ~ Come on, don't make a scene. I'm not making a scene. Stupid! I have a pain here. ~ In the belly? ~ No, here. In the belly. In the belly. I know. It should be an air bubble. No, it's a pain. It's a feeling of helplessness and despair. It is indeed a pain... Ah, you see? You see, you really can't tell me where the pain's coming from? Why? Because you're actually happy. I, by getting rid of the child, have read an unconscious desire of yours. Let's call home to see if he arrived. ~ What could have happened to him? ~ Nothing! I am in favor of natural selection. ~ What? ~ Nothing, nothing. Call Fernanda. ~ Maybe he went to his mother. ~ No! I won't call Fernanda, no way. Then try at the grandparents'. ~ But did he say anything? ~ No, no. ~ Is he angry with me? ~ No. He didn't want to go to England? Ilaria, it's me, did he show up? No, OK. I'll call you back. Bye. ~ If you knew...all this mess... ~ If I knew what? Nothing. Want a drink? No. Quit messing about. You know I'm pregnant? ~ Huh? ~ I'm pregnant! ~ But are you sure? ~ I've seen the analysis. But weren't you taking the pill? ~ Boo... ~ Ah! Dear pharmaceutical industry, who will compensate me? Compensate ME, I'd say. What do we do? Should we have him? But, yes. He'll be the son of the revolution. I ask you to hear the reading of the articles of the civil code... governing relations between spouses. Article 143: Marriage requires mutual obligation of spouses of cohabitation... ~ loyalty... ~ Please... and assistance. Article 144: The husband is the head of the family. The woman acquires his condition,... takes his surname, and is required to accompany him... to where he sees fit to take up residence. Article 145: The husband has the duty to protect his wife,... to keep her and provide whatever is necessary... for the necessities of life, in proportion to his wealth. The woman should contribute to the maintenance of the husband, if he does not have sufficient means. Here...and here. Unconscious. Come, Fernanda. Your turn to sign. Unconscious. Here... for the initial expenses. ~ No, no, no. ~ But, take it. Come on, take it. Don't even mention it. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Thanks, Dad! And I hope it happens to you, too. Tristano, would you answer the phone? Hello? Admiral Politi. Dear, how are you? Of course she's here. But she's playing. Can you tell me? OK, dear. All right. Honey, it's your son. Wants to talk to you. I'm not sure whether to fold or bet this bluff. Because I'm sure that this is a bluff. ~ Says it's urgent. ~ Given the urgency, I'll pick up the bluff. Hello, love, tell me. No! Why should he come to me? Are you kidding me? How? It's not possible. But...yes, I'm very calm. But you also need to do something. But is there anybody home? Ah, thought it was Milena. No, I have nothing against her. But she doesn't inspire much confidence. But why don't you come here to Tristano, at least we can discuss it a bit. Well, do as you wish. Should we call the sheriff? No, don't act out! ~ No. ~ How can he not be there? So, he's stupid? But...Who are you calling now? The other grandparents. We hope it works out... Hello? Hello. Has Eugenio gotten there? What are you saying? He's with your friend, of course. They left together. What happened? But if you say that your friend's there, shouldn't he be there, too? How could that happen? Eugenio has disappeared. Hello? What happened? But what's the matter, eh? ~ The little one... ~ But how... You could at least move with a little tenderness. I exist too! He was crying. Thank you, I do not smoke! I have no more, it was the last one. What should I do, split it in two? Thankfully, he'll be going to the grandparents' for a while. ~ Do you want this? ~ No. ~ A little bit... ~ No! What's up? Do I disgust you? But do you know that when you're with me, I can't...take a test? Go to a meeting... I think that I've become an idiot. There's some doubt, you've already taken two years to obtain the license. I'm not a pilot, no one is perfect. Would you like to know what you're perfect at? In bed! No, even in that, you're worth little. In fact, you know what? You're worthless. Poor Fernanda. Why "poor"? According to your standards, I am sexually healthy, I'm going to bed with whom I please, when I want,... without difficulty. Pig! Fernanda, where are you going? I was kidding. The idiot was kidding! Fernanda, listen. Wait, please. Don't be childish. Come on, let's talk like civilized people. Fernanda! Where are you going? Fernanda! ~ Eugenio! ~ Oh, my God! You left him! Moron! Damn you! But, who got off the train, you or me? Should I have thought you were going to get off, too? It's OK, take it easy. ~ We were taking him to your parents'? ~ So what? So now he is going on his own! In short, he'll get there on his own. First car, compartment 4. First car, compartment 4. ~ He's mine! ~You think it's right to abandon a child? No, it isn't right. You're right, it's sheer madness. Sorry, I went to the bathroom for a moment. But who did you entrust your child to? I will report you both, I'll send you both to jail. At least you've warned your wife? OK, I'll call Fernanda. But you go immediately to the police station. File a report, immediately! Hey, hey, hey. Bring a sheet of stamped paper. What do we do now? Every time I open one of those frightening doors... I noticed that the lock mechanism... was less complicated than I thought... and where I expected to find terror,... torture, horror, I discovered only an angry girl:... unhappy, frightened, angry. Hello? Yes, who is speaking? It's your father. ~ Tell him I'm not well. ~ But should I tell him you had an abortion? No, no explanation. I'm not well and that's all. Fernando doesn't feel very well. Could you tell me? No, no. It's nothing serious. He says he has urgent news about your son. OK, hand it to me. Hello? Fine. But if I say it's not serious, it's not serious. It's just a temporary discomfort. Tell me... What? And you've trusted him to Baffo? But, how long has he been gone? No, he didn't get here and he hasn't phoned. But his father, what's he doing? No, I do not know. No. OK, I'll take care. Bye, thanks. Eugenio disappeared. But what does that mean? I don't know. He was vague, just said: Eugenio is gone. Behind this will be Giancarlo's hand, believe me. Yes, yes. It's surely a trap. Don't bite the bait. Don't speak ill of Giancarlo, I love him very much. You know that rabbits get up to fourteen pups per litter? And in Australia they even have to destroy them. Because...they ruin the crops. Why not put them in a cage? Because those are for domestic rabbits --- these rabbits are wild. The mother of this one bore ten pups, nine white and one black. The mother was white, but she mated with a black male. Watch the turkey. Did you know that turkeys are polygamous? There are tough battles among the males to get females. And then, the loser is excluded, the winner keeps turning the wheel and mates with all females. Look, Mom! She came, too. ~ Ah, really? ~ Yes. You know you grew up? Hi, Mom. Hello. You've grown a bit, haven't you? ~ Hello. ~ Hello. He has grown, huh? I told him so a while ago. Where should they sleep? We don't even know whether they'll be staying. Suppose they will, eh? We can give them our room. But this could be too much. And it could be interpreted as a bit of malice. ~ What do you say? ~ I say yes. Anyway, it should be ascertained whether or not they sleep together. Sorry, ask them. Ah, yes. But who, him or her? You...How do you sleep? No, I mean, do you plan to sleep in the same room? I don't know. Whatever will be more comfortable for you. In Eugene's room, which was Fernanda's... there are two beds, but separate. All right. ~ The child can sleep with us. ~ Yes, yes, fine. Not true. In Milan we were fine. ~ No. ~ Why do you say no? ~ Eugenio, why are you here? ~ Why aren't you asleep? Grandpa snores, and I can't sleep. Stories! But since you're both sleeping in the same bed, I can sleep there. Good night. ~ Bye, Mom. ~ Bye. ~ Did you say hello to Eugenio? ~ No, he was sound asleep. You say hello for me. Eh, yes. Unfortunately, last night he moved from your room... without grandma noticing. You were snoring and he couldn't sleep. ~ Bye, Dad. ~ Are you leaving? ~ Yes ~ Bye. ~ When'll you come back? ~ No idea. ~ Hello. ~ Hello. ~ Did you say hello to Eugenio? ~ He's asleep. He'll feel bad if he doesn't see you around. Are you going? Yes, I have an urgent appointment in Rome. Kiss Eugenio. See you soon. ? I wonder how it happened, but it's so,... ? I'm here. ? Meanwhile, I go from one hand to another. ? I eat, I drink, I sleep, but I do not know why. ? And I would go away,... ? with no one to take care of me. ? I wonder how it happened, but it's so,... ? I'm here. Here he is! Have you found him? No, they haven't found him. So about all this story, I don't know anything. And Giancarlo? Where is Giancarlo? ~ Giancarlo doesn't live here anymore. ~ He doesn't live here anymore? We're no longer together, he didn't tell you? By the way, you young people never cease to amaze me. In my house? But what have you done? Giancarlo has sold it. As he must vacate it in six months, in the meantime I habit it. Honey, should we not give some thought to the child? But they have sold the house! What's happened? Has he been abducted? I'm tired, I can't take it anymore. I want to go to Giancarlo's. ~ We'll go with you. ~ Yeah, yeah, come to Giancarlo's. Then your friend has usurped your parental rights over your son Eugenio. Ten years old and male. ~ Is that true? ~ But no, he hasn't usurped anything from anyone. He just made a joke. ~ So is he an idiot? ~ Why? Why do you say that? Someone who abandons a ten year old child in plain countryside,... under the rain, is either a criminal or an idiot. In fact, he's an idiot. The fact is that we can't find him, that's why we're here. We do not want to denounce anyone... we just want you to help in the search. Ah, no, dear sir, here we're in the presence of child neglect. I can not do anything without having first clarified the circumstances of the act. Name, surname, and address. ~ Whose? ~ Of the complainants. But could you begin searching without wasting time? Want to teach me my job? I will not teach you anything, I just want my son. I told you this would be a waste of time. Come over here a little while, will you? Me? Yes, yes, you, you. Full name, address, and occupation. But I am not the complainant. ~ No, you are the denounced. ~ Denounced by whom? By me. I denounce you for child neglect. ~ OK. ~ Full name, address, and occupation. My name is Ennio Miposi. ~ Profession? ~ Journalist. Where do you work? ~ But why do you care? ~ Excuse me, really? I didn't understand that well. I am...an editor of the satirical newspaper "L'Oca". ~ What newspaper? ~ "L'Oca", don't you know it? Evaristo! ~ Your orders, Commissioner! ~ For the man, handcuffs and cell. Go! Aye aye! But, what's this, I come to ask for help, and my friend gets arrested? Friend? Ah, then you agree: you wanted to get rid of the child. ~ But do not say stupid things, come on. ~ They are not stupid thing. OK, OK, whatever. A child is a child, but...is also a huge burden, right? Stop, stop. What did you say? ~ I mean, do you have children? ~ Yes, so what? Yes, yes. Why did you make them? Would you explain why you made them? But I did not make them. Well, with you or without you, your wife made them. The point is, why did you both make them? Why keep making children? Perhaps because they'd become your support in your old age. Do you see today any son supporting his own father? Quite the contrary, parents are who support their own jobless sons. He's of no use to the family. The company does not want him. Why? Because a child means a seat on the train... a place in the school, a job, a place in the hospital,... there's no jobs, hospitals don't work... so they get tired and at eighteen they make a revolution. Now they're small, but they'll grow, you'll see. Would you like to have a child at eighteen who made a revolution... or maybe planted some bomb, eh? But back to us, Commissioner, I know why you made them. To photograph them, to kiss their faces,... to take a walk, to photograph them... for comparison with other children? We start that way: mine is smarter than yours, yours is well bred, mine isn't,... yours is...less pretty than mine. Oh! Yes...if you can eliminate defective dogs, you can abandon them. But not a child, a child you have to keep. Like him. I gave him a hand and he got angry. He's an ingrate, he is! ~ Finished? ~ Yes, I'm done. Handcuffs and to the cell, carry on. The prophets always pay for other people's sins. Good night. "L'Oca"! Do you know what that newspaper cost me? Five miles on foot. Each week, from one booth to another. To seize it. They make it, and I go seize it. Do you know how many men we have here? Four, including me. Plus two dogs they gave us to follow tracks. So they say. The truth is that they gave them because this is the countryside. Could not we use these dogs for the search? We could try, but it takes a personal object of the victim. Why a victim? But how else could we call it? Of the deceased. Do you have any other personal object with you? No, I have not. But I can go my in-laws' home, not far from here. Whatever. But first you'll have to make a statement. It's Giancarlo. ~ Is there anyone home? ~ They're all gone. And if Eugenio had come here, who would he find? He would find me in front of the door. Yes, but I need some of Eugene's clothes, so the police dogs can smell it. ~ They haven't left the key. ~ What fools! They were so shaken that they left in a hurry. Don't you know that tomorrow they'll be leaving for Australia? The second daughter is expecting a child. They were so desperate because they loved little Eugenio so much. But how could he have gone? Yes, well, they loved him. But, meanwhile, they did everything possible to get rid of him. But what have you done, so that your grandparents can't keep you anymore? Me? Nothing. May I be excused? Go, go. Will we meet again? ~ Of course. ~ But what questions! Do you know...you should try to get back together. Eugenio needs his family. ~ Yes, Dad, we know. ~ You know, but... Eugenio... You can come with us. Are you happy with that? ~ I'm staying here. ~ What did you say? I'm staying here! So, are we going? He doesn't want to come. Why not? What's this I hear? I'm not going. ~ What? ~ I'm not going. Why not? I don't want to. Enough of your stupid whims. Your grandparents are tired. You should be happy to go with us. ~ Are you listening? ~ Yes. Go find the bag, it's all ready. Well? I'm not going. Enough. Come on. Enough! Let him be, don't do that. Come on! It seems he's good with us and doesn't want to leave. You can trust your grandmother. You are a little man now. It should be you who decides. Do you really want to stay with us, or do you want to go back to the city with your mom and dad? ~ No! ~ No to what? That's enough. Come on, get in the car. Don't do that. You'll hurt him. ~ Enough! ~ Leave him alone! ~ Move! ~ Leave him alone! Get in! ~ I won't allow it! ~ He's my son, God sake! Eugenio, come here! ~ Eugenio! ~ Violence doesn't solve anything. Eugenio, come to your grandfather. Come to me, dear. Come on. Listen, Eugenio...Ay! Ay! ~ Hey, don't hit him. ~ Now what's with him? Can you tell me what came over you? Why does it bother you so much to go with us? Come to your grandfather, come on. Let's talk calmly, you and I. Come on, tell me, does it upset you so much to leave? This is only for a short time. Then you can come back here if you want to. ~ Be good now. ~ Ay! Oh, sorry. Did I hurt you? Listen, now you're going to fetch your bag yourself. OK? OK? But what am I supposed to do with you, eh? Huh? No, not that way. You come here. Come here! Come here... Eugenio, open up! I'll break down the door! ~ Open up! ~ I think you'd better leave him. Come take him in a few days. Open, Eugenio! It is better to leave him, come take him in a few days. Enough, we've already decided. You should have thought of that before. ~ Open up! ~ You're the one who should have thought before getting married. What's up with you? Are you ill? ~ Oh, yeah? ~ You know that I suffer from asthma. ~ Have you the pills? ~ No. Mom, a glass of water, hurry! Here, drink, hurry. You've made your father feel sick, are you happy now? Eugenio... Do you understand? Because of you, your father is ill. Shame on you! Not true! Dad isn't sick. On the contrary, it's quite true. He's very sick and it's all your fault. No, I'll go. Can I lay in your bed? What animals are these? Amphibious turtles. Do they live in water? They are amphibious. OK. You've got a photo of mom... ~ Why not mine, too? ~ I've asked for one, but you didn't sent it. Do you smoke? This child tends to overreact. Eugenio is a perfectly normal child. Sit. Mom and Dad haven't been able to keep you with them up to now. But now...why don't you want to go with us, eh? Because I don't feel like it. What do you mean, "I don't feel like it"? You know that I can force you? But I don't feel like doing it by force. Do it by force. But you have asthma. Fernanda, you see him. I can't stand him anymore. ~ Mama, Mama. ~ Ay! Come, come, don't cry. But can you tell me what's come over you? Come on, don't cry, come on. What's come over you? If I come with you, I'd have to leave all my animals. But maybe we can bring a couple of them, eh? Can I bring the duck? ~ Yes. ~ What about the hare? All right. But I also want the bunny. Yes, even the bunny. Eugenio! Eugenio! Eugenio! What an ugly name! Why did we name him Eugenio? After his grandfather. For continuity of the name. Maybe if his name weren't Eugenio, all this wouldn't have happened. ~ Can you help me? ~ Yes. How many TVs! Funny, right? Mamma mia, what a mess. In two minutes I'll put everything in order. ~ Daddy, Daddy... ~ Are you talking to me? ~ Yes. ~ I'm just not used... to being called Dad. Call me Giancarlo, OK? Tell me, what's up? ~ Food for the animals --- you don't have any? ~ I don't think so. Neither for animals, nor for us. I'll look for it. Listen, Eugenio, would you like to spend one month at sea with me? Huh? ~ Where? ~ A beautiful place. Now I do... Times have changed. We go from summer to winter in a flash. Then comes early frost, the fruit gets frozen, it costs three times the price... and I sell less fruit, and I earn less, my dear. This morning I didn't even want to go to the general market. Do you want something? ~ Pardon? ~ What do you want? Lettuce. Capuchin Lettuce is all right? Yes, OK. 100 lire per 100 grams --- how much do you want? I have only 500 lire and I have to get some bran, too. Bran? Yes, it's for ducks. ~ For ducks? ~ Yes. That's for the rabbits. This one here is too good. Guerrino, shut the boxes, we have to close. Yes, right away. You, take this. Take this one, which for rabbits...it's even too good, and it costs you nothing. Tomorrow I'll bring the dry bread... Just tell me where you live. This is much better than what you asked for. ~ What? ~ The thread. ~ Ah, the bran. ~ Yes. I have to close your market stall. I'm coming, I'm with a customer. ~ Who is this, your father? ~ No, the shop is his. I've already eaten rabbits, they are very tasty. Where do you live, so tomorrow I can bring you some dry bread? Right near here, number 12, apartment 123. ~ Bye, thanks. ~ Bye. ~ By the way, I don't eat the animals. ~ I do. ~ Can I? ~ Again? Why should I be blamed if you wake up me? And then if I can't go back to sleep. We'll never get to sleep if you keep going back and forth. It's me who can't sleep if you keep talking. Hand me a cigarette. Don't you see that smoking is bad for you? Now go sleep. Close the door! I don't want to talk, I want to sleep. Do you understand? If you do that, I'll take a taxi and go to my house. ~ Don't be like that. ~ Don't get so... Fernanda... What are you doing here again? I'm hot. Can I take off my pajamas like you did? I wasn't wearing them to start with, I didn't take them off. Take off your pajamas but go to sleep, come on. Fernanda, back to bed. I'll sleep, but only if you sleep too. OK, let's sleep. You go back to bed, come on. Come on. Close the door. Did you notice that you can't go? ~ That would frustrate the legitimate expectations of our child. ~ Yes, but go to sleep. But what are you doing? ~ Don't smoke, it's bad for you. ~ What the hell do you care? Nothing, just trying to be logical. You have asthma, you shouldn't smoke. ~ I would rather do something else. ~ No! I have to pee. ~ Eugenio, enough! ~ I think you're overdoing it. All right. But if you keep talking, I'll never get to sleep. You both have to agree. Now I'll make you a nice chamomile and then let's see if you don't sleep. Filthy dog! ~ I'll sleep, I'll sleep. ~ You'll drink a chamomile. What are you doing? I'm taking 2,000 lire for dry bread. ~ Dry bread? ~ Yes, for the animals. Couldn't you ask Fernanda? She left. ~ Where did she go? ~ How should I know? This is my friend, Guerrino. Come on, Guerrino. Check out all the TVs! Are they all yours? No, my father repairs them. He's an electronic engineer. ~ Where do I put this bread? ~ Here, I'll show you the animals. The other one is named Fernanda, like my mother. He's named Arturo. Rabbits breed in any season, just like humans. ~ Cute. ~ He's a male. Now I must...I must go, or else I'll be late. Hey, would you put aside more vegetables for the rabbits? ~ What's this here? ~ It's the bread for the animals. He brought it. ~ And who's he? ~ Guerrino, a friend of mine. Good morning. This is for breakfast, then you have to get dressed, so we can go buy things for the sea. ~ Ah, you're leaving for real? ~ Sure, why do you ask? ~ Fernanda, the phone! ~ Yes, I'm coming. Thanks. Hello? Hello, and how are you? Wonderful! Oh, great! No, no, I'm free, I'm free. How many weeks? Just one. That's fine for me. Who is the director? Hey, I'll make a proposal: Would you come here every morning to feed animals while I'm away? ~ Yes, but how much? ~ Every morning. No, I mean you how much would you give me. Ahhh, well...1,000 lire each day? Maybe. Eugenio... What, Mom? Come here a moment. Coming, Mom. What? Forget the sea. You won't be going. You know...I have a job offer. 3,000,000 in less than two months. I can't turn it down. You understand these things, you're a little man, right? After that we'll go to sea, together, OK? I'm going back to the grandparents? No, no, you'll stay here with your dad. Is that true, Giancarlo? Sure, we'll stay together, right? ~ Like two good friends, eh? OK? ~ Ok. ~ Guerrino, forget it. I'm not leaving. ~ Yes, but now I can go? Yeah, but we'll keep meeting up. Sure, if you want. Good night. Farewell, Eugenio. Goodbye. As soon as I see it's possible, you'll come to me. If you are patient, when I come back we'll go to the sea. OK? ~ Yes, Mom. ~ Are you sad that I'm going? No, Mom. Ah, so you don't mind any if I go? Yes, I care a lot, I just said that not to make you sad. ~ So, you are sad? ~ Yeah, I'm sad. You're sad? Yes, yes, but I shouldn't be. Work is first and foremost. Goodbye. ~ Bye. ~ Bye. A kiss. Bye bye. Somebody rang. Is my TV ready? ~ Who are you? ~ Ragionier Carmelotti. C A R M E L O T T I It is the third time that you've forced me to come here! Not ready. Come back tomorrow. Not ready. Come back tomorrow. I've had enough. This is the third time I've come here. Do you understand? I'm not going without my TV. There it is! ~ Does it work? ~ No! This is true and genuine failure. What's the lesson to be learned from this incident? Never accept work from unpleasant people. Guerrino! Dad, look. Guerrino, Guerrino, come. Come here. What are you doing here, Guerrino? The fruit man fired me because he said I stole fruit. Is this car new? ~ Nearly new... ~ Look, it'll reach 180. Close to, close to. What did it cost? One million. A little cash and a lot in fees. ~ Don't you want a ride? ~ Sure! Get in. Hello. Is Giancarlo here? He's working. Giancarlo, a client... Nice or nasty? I don't know. Judge for yourself. ~ Hello. ~ Hello. So who are you? A helper? No, I'm his son. But what's this, your son's here with you? And why shouldn't he be? This smells... Uhhh. Rabbits, ducks... Uh, I cook them great. I don't eat the rabbits, I study them. I've come to take a shower. ~ May I? ~ Yes, yes. There. I know, I know. Eugenio... ~ Listen... ~ What? Come here. Why not go to the movies? Can I take Guerrino? Yes, yes. ~ Where will you meet him? ~ At the traffic lights. ~ Do you want this, 1,000 lire? ~ Want it, 1,000, sir? Only 1,000 lire. One package, 1,000 lire. Want one? 1,000 lire. Do you want one, Miss?, 1,000 lire. A packet, 1,000 lire. Want it? Want this? 1,000, ma'am. Want? 1,000. 1,000 lire, do you want one? ~ But... ~ What are you doing here? I'm helping a friend. I earn money, too. Dad says it's OK. Dad says it's OK? ~ Get in now, we're going home. ~ No, home. Why not? ~ Because...there's no one there. ~ But how can it be that there's no one there? How can it be that there's no one? But, your father leaves you on the street on your own? No, I have the keys. I can go in whenever I want. ~ Well, then go. ~ Come up, come on. ~ No, not now! ~ Why not now? Because I can't. ~ Are you sure your dad isn't home? ~ Sure he's not home. He's out on a job. ~ Give me the keys. ~ What keys? The keys to your home. I have lost them. Yes, yes. I just lost them. Ask him. All right. We'll come back another time. Let's go. Goodbye. Have a fine work day. Son of a bitch. He stole my handkerchiefs. You'll pay for them! Hey, where is the phone? Back there. ~ Hello. If I knew you were coming... ~ What would you have done? Sorry. I've got a phone call. Hello? Ah, it's you. Yes, thanks for letting me know, but... now it's too late. If Milena comes to see me again, does it bother you? No. As long as I can go to Guerrino. What if she sometimes...sleeps here? I have my own bed. So I'll only bother you to pee. Eat. You don't like mom anymore? Yeah, I like her. Eat, eat. So it's her who doesn't love you? Forget it. Eat. But, you and mom, when you're in the same bed, what do you do? These are things that don't concern you. Eat. Of course they concern me! If you hadn't mated, I wouldn't exist. Eat, come on. ~ Mom is a feminist? ~ Right. Clandestine abortions are performed... by police officers on women! Repressed males masturbate in the bathroom! Repressed males masturbate in the bathroom! Look, Mom. Repressed males masturbate in the bathroom! Hey, you promised you wouldn't take me to my grandparents' house anymore. Yes, to grandmother Anna and grandfather Eugenio's, I won't. But to my mother's, to grandmother's Egidia, I will. She is your grandmother too, right? She also has the right to see you. I want to be with you. ~ Is my mother here? ~ Yes, yes, she is. She's playing cards. Uncle Tristano is here, too. I'll let her know. How is my father? Hey, a real disaster, like always. Dad... Dad, I'm Giancarlo. Don't you recognize me? Dad, how are you? I brought my son Eugenio. Eugenio came to see you. I think he recognized you. ~ Darling. ~ Mama... Dear Eugenio... I think he's worsened. He's being treated by the best doctors. The paralysis is progressive --- expectations are minimal. We must prepare for the worst. You know that I wouldn't have recognized if you hadn't come with your father? You're simply sprouting up--- you're a little man already. All I have here are a few friends who try to distract me with a little poker game. You could dress decently, at least once. This is Eugenio...greet Tristano, he loves you as well, did you know that? Turn, Eugenio! How you've grown! You know I'd held you in my arms? Egidia, you had two aces in sight against two. You must get back. Coming, coming. Now I'm going to bring tea. Well, I'm going. Goodbye. Ah, yes, Dad. Me too. And excuse my jeans. Is it true that the grandfather was an admiral? ~ Right. ~ Tristano is also Admiral? Indeed! All admirals. Giancarlo, the telephone. The phone, Giancarlo. Huh? Phone. Hello? Ah, hello. ~ Where are you calling from? ~ Where do you want me to call from? From Spain. How's Eugenio? My father phoned me. What have you been up to? Ah, yes. They passed by here, and raised a bit of a mess. Send him to me here, I can keep him perfectly. Why not, he doesn't want to? Well, he's fine being here with me. Is it true, Eugenio, that you're fine being with me? Tell him that I suffer for not seeing him for so long. That's also true. You suffer for not seeing Eugenio? And I won't send him to you! Is it true, Eugenio, that you want to stay with me? Nooo. Passed through here...two days ago to take a shower. But she is in Rome? Come on, send him to me --- so you're more free. And... how well you have settled in? Don't worry. If I tell you I can keep him, I can. Yes, let me talk to him. Wait. Mom wants to talk to you. Hello? OK. I agreed with Giancarlo. We bought a car. No, no. I want to stay with Giancarlo. Thanks. A kiss. Good night. Huh? Yes...No...Eh...very well. Goodbye. Goodbye. You shouldn't give up an opportunity like this, only to please me. I'll go some other time. You may not get another chance like this... Spain is interesting. ~ Have you been there? ~ Yes. If not, how could I tell you about it? And then there are the bullfights. Are those where they kill the bulls? No...it's not quite so violent a show as they say. It's interesting. It's a struggle...between the bull and the bullfighter. ~ Have you seen a bullfight yourself? ~ Sure, if not, how could I tell you? So you would do whatever it took to send me to Spain? Of course not, what are you saying? It's just that...it seems to me that such an opportunity is not to be missed. And then there's Mom, she has a right to see you. OK, tell Mom. Dear Fernanda, today at the airport while saying goodbye to Eugenio, I felt like a traitor. I can't get this thought out of my head... that no one could explain why Eugenio exists, apart from biology,... except as a burden. Deep in our souls we are two civilized people,... compared to many others. Yet the end of our relationship, which left Eugenio as a byproduct... has been worked out with great reasonableness. We've always let him know, and so... I'm sending him to you since it's not right that Milena, to his eyes, takes your place. At least temporarily. Why? Because we can't tell him... that his biological father needs to have sex and so does his mother...? All this is uncomfortable, and I feel like I'm a worm. I don't know why, but that's how it is. Or rather, I do know. We are deceiving him. But he's understood things anyway. This is for you:... Important international company seeks, on behalf of the Italian Reliant... an electrical engineering expert. ~ Good knowledge of English. Do you speak English? ~ No. Let's find another one, come on. Malaysia: able to manage independently with push and ability. Push? Mmm. I can't imagine you. Good knowledge of English for this one, too... Let's see. Fast-growing company with... highly challenging and dynamic ambience, opportunity for frequent movements... with reimbursement of expenses. You can eat caviar every day. English is a must, and evening dress, even here. Do you have experience in marketing, merchandising, promotion? No one answers. English proficiency is required. Then they say that in Italy there's no work offer. But, you should have studied English! I bet you speak Latin. Huh? So why not find a place in a seminary? What's up to you? Are you angry because you don't speak English? You know that I was fond of Eugenio? Even dogs get fond. Who is it? I'm looking for Guerrino. Guerrino isn't here. Who are you, what do you want? I am the father of a friend of your son. I am the father of Eugenio. I don't know if Guerrino has ever spoken... ~ Yes, yes, I was told. Come in. ~ Thanks. ~ Will Guerrino be back soon? ~ Why wouldn't he come back? He'll be here. But what's going on? We can't find Eugenio. Have a seat. ~ Teresa, come and make coffee. ~ No, you needn't bother. How long has he been on the run? He hasn't run away. Don't worry, I have a 8 year-old child, so many times he's out even for a month... Women police use to take him back to me. Teresa, how many days has Tonino been out? ~ Twelve days. ~ The man's Eugenio's father. ~ My pleasure. ~ Go make coffee, go. But when will Guerrino be back? Guerrino is a nice boy. If he hasn't earned 15,000 lire, he won't come home. Because if he doesn't, he knows I'll show him such a long face... But not always, because they take him away to work. Thanks. I don't know what to think. ~ How long has your child been missing? ~ Since yesterday night. This time at least you should make him pay for it. But not with the hands. Because this only tickles the brain. With the whip. It hurts and doesn't leave marks. Thanks. Did my son come here often? Your boy? Sure. He's a smart kid. It's right that he wants to be a vet. He's made for studying. He wants to be a vet? He told me so himself. You didn't know? How much did you earn? Have you seen Eugenio? ~ 16,000. ~ Great. ~ Have you seen Eugenio? ~ No. Why? ~ He's gone. ~ Missing? Have you seen the doctor's son? Tell the truth, or I'll shake you. No, no, let him be. You needn't do that. I came here without much hope. Goodbye, Guerrino. Goodbye. Are you OK now? Yes. Thank you very much. Please, Fernanda. Young people have discovered everything, but the one thing they haven't discovered is a sense of duty. ~ Enough about Eugenio, it's not the time for that. ~ Why isn't it the time? When we got married, did we take things lightly? And our two children, have we brought them up laughing and joking? You have to tell it like it is. ~ Eugenio, enough. ~ Why is it enough? Since we got married...did we ever think of splitting up? These two were thinking of splitting up even before they got married. ~ I beg you, Eugenio, don't provoke things. ~ Provoking who, them? No, me! I don't understand. For thirty years you haven't understood. Why do you say that? Here's the moronic one, to trust a child to a wastrel like Baffo, a humorist. Any news? None. Then you'll explain why you made them throw you out of the house. Is it true that you sold it? Don't you want me to call the manager --- he's a friend of mine? Everything is our fault. But, come on, Fernanda. I'm so afraid that something's happened to him. No, no. We'll find him, I'm sure. I need something, some clothes of Eugenio to let the police dogs smell them. ~ Will this do? ~ Yes, I think so. A soon as I learn anything I'll call you. Goodbye. ~ Bye. ~ Bye. ~ Are you all right? ~ No, it's nothing, nothing. Sorry... ~ What is it? ~ She had an abortion. ~ How could she have an abortion? ~ She had an abortion. Please, I want to be alone with my daughter. Go. You too, please. All of you, leave. ~ When she's like so, I want to know, too. ~ Later, later. Please leave us alone. Mom, now's not the time. I'm tired, give me a break. I want a word with you. Speak. Cry. React. Have no guilt. You and your guilt. Why should I be guilty? There's no sense of guilt. You mother hasn't shown up yet. She's not there. But what if someone is holding a sign with my name? ~ What's your name? ~ Eugenio. ~ Excuse me, have you come for a child? ~ Yes. ~ There he is. ~ Ah, thanks. Can you show me some ID, please? Thank you very much. Eugenio...Eugenio, go with this man who'll take you to your mother. ~ Here's Eugenio. ~ Oh, you've had a good trip? ~ Bye. ~ Bye. Can I have that thing? Hello. I didn't come to the airport because I was working. Do you mind? A little, but not much. In fact a lot, but it's no biggie. I thought you'd be happy to see me --- why are you crying? ~ Me?, I'm not crying. ~ You have tears. Ah, yes, I was crying. ~ I'm hungry. Good. Now we'll dress smart and we'll eat together on the terrace of the hotel. Oh, what a mess! What can I put you in the upper part, eh? ~ Who sleeps there? ~ Nobody. Tonight you sleep there. Go have a shower, come on. Since you work all day, I can go to a bullfight? Bullfight? No, no. It would upset you very much. I went once and I felt very bad. ~ And what is this? ~ Stuff of mine! Have you woken up? ~ Why can't I go with you? ~ Because I should be working. And we have no place in the car. Read the magazine that I've left, eh? Goodbye. 10 AM, tennis, the court is already booked and paid. What a joke. After tennis, a dip in the pool, not in the sea, because it's dangerous. Good night. At 1 PM eat brunch on the terrace of the hotel. Well, that's possible. Are you Italian? Yeah, right. Do you speak Spanish? A little. Excuse me, could you order for me, because I don't understand the menu? But, it depends on what you want --- do you want meat or fish? Soup. Mister, have you known my mother for a long time? But I don't know whether I know her or not. Who's your mother? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you don't know her. My mother came here for work. I came to see her. I'm her son. That tall lady, blonde, very beautiful. Last night you also gave her a book. Well, yes. We are friends, yes. And you both intend to sleep together? Hey, you know you're a great meddler? Excuse me. Today I met a friend of yours. Oh yeah? And where did you meet him? In the restaurant. Do the two of you have a good relationship? Yes, but what are you getting at? Better than Dad? Dad and I are always good friends. Sleep, come on, Eugenio. Good night. Dad's never beaten you? Are you crazy? No man has ever beaten me. ~ Then I'll beat you! ~ But, Eugenio! Quit it, Eugenio! Oh, you're hurting me. Please. Ouch. ~ Eugenio! ~ Will you take me to the bullfight? No! Eugenio, be quiet! ~ Will you take me to bullfight? ~ No! ~ Will you take me to bullfight? ~ No! You're hurting me, be still, Eugenio. I'll take you! Stop! What are they doing? They'll bring out another bull now? I can't take it anymore. Let's go. ~ Come on. ~ No, no. Stay here. But you're pale as a paper sheet! We're both going to feel bad. ~ And I want to stay and that's final! ~ Stay you both, I'm going. No! You stay! Don't be so stubborn, Eugenio. But Dad...but dad loves bullfighting. But, if your father's never been to Spain, where could he have him seen a bullfight? I don't believe you. ~ Sure. ~ I say...I say no. I say that he's never been to Spain. It is useless to suffer for a show you don't like. Let's just leave, don't you think? But why is everyone so excited? Hello? Ah. Ah, it's you. Yes. How is Eugenio? No, I told him about bullfighting to encourage him to go to Spain. You are stupid! It is always awkward to lie to children. No, now he's calmed down, he's still asleep. I've found a notebook where he writes poetry. Listen. I'll read one. It seems impossible that he could have written it. Listen. Nostalgia. Today I rediscovered an old faded memory,... in an old wrinkled coat. It actually returns me to the old days... when I used to play in the garden. Now I don't play anymore... because of a horrible virtue, old age. "Horrible virtue, old age." It looks like a line of Quasimodo. When? Your father? Why didn't you tell me right away? Hello? Dad!...Giancarlo... Listen, I have a lot of things to tell you. First, I'm sorry about my grandfather. It's true...he has ceased to suffer. But what I meant... Why did you say that you liked the bullfights? I can't speak too long, this call is expensive. What do you mean, it doesn't cost anything? What hotel? Down here? I'll rush downstairs...No, no. You come. No. Do as you like. Eugenio! But what are you doing? You saw me so you ran away? I wasn't wearing any pants. ~ How did you get here? ~ In the car. In the car? You actually made it get here? True, it is a bomb. With it I could get to Madagascar, if I wanted to. ~ And where will you sleep, in the hotel? ~ Yes, and who pays? ~ I brought the tent. ~ The tent? I can sleep with you in the tent? Of course. Pass me the shovel. ~ Would you hold it? ~ Yes, I'll hold it. ~ And how many sleeping bags did you bring? ~ Two. One for me, one for you. ~ What about Mom? ~ Mom is a woman, she sleeps in the hotel. Right. Here's Mom. ~ Hello. ~ Hello. Who's that man over there? A friend of Mom, don't you know him? Where did you met him? He took us to the bullfight. I see. Great! You've settled well, eh? Want to help? ~ No. I want to sleep with you. ~ Yes, Mom. I have sleeping bags for only two. No matter, we'll fit into one. ? I wonder how it happened, but it's so,... ? now I'm here. ? They didn't want me, or maybe they did,... ? now I'm here. ? And I'm going for a walk to see... ? If I would like the thing, at least a little,... ? I would like to know... ? if for the others I'm too much, or maybe not. Let's see. Better not let them see us, or mom gets angry. Yes. What is this thing for? To make a show. Here are four entries. Hey, hey. I made a color proof, look. This is not about color. The director says it's too small. Well, now take the measurements, and count the steps. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Nearly seven meters. Ah, short of eight...it's too small. But...listen... But who called this woman? This is a friend of the English director, she came to... No, here I can't do my show. But can we discuss it? What do you want to discuss? You're stupid! Not true. I followed the directions you gave me in Italy. This woman should be fired! She made us spend so much money... You can go back to Italy. But what do you do, you're crazy? ~ I'm saying you're an incompetent. ~ Let me go, let me go! ~ Eh. ~ What's up? You knocked out him with a right or a left? I didn't knocked out him, I've just beat him. I just accomplished a dream. Dad left me the house with everything in it. Mom, I think she wants to move to Tristano's. We could move into it. The whole house just for us? Are you happy, Mom? ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Hi, Eugenio, greetings. Hi, Eugenio. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ What's in here? ~ Ah, ah, you want to know too early. Where's Mom? ~ She's busy in the kitchen. ~ Ah, well. What are you expecting from Santa Claus? Ah, I expect to get a dog. No, dogs in the city are unhappy. They suffer very much. If you want a dog, come to the countryside with us. ~ Season's Greetings. ~ Season's Greetings. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Season's Greetings, Eugenio. ~ Season's Greetings. ~ What are you expecting from Santa Claus? ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Well, I expected a dog. You can't be sure, you haven't opened the packages yet. Besides, a dog in a package? ~ Yeah, why not? Do you understand that dogs in the city are unhappy? The suffer greatly. And then they become old, sick, and you have to heal them. How empty my home looks. Yet they've only taken down a few ornaments. What about the silver? We've put it in a safe place. Merry Christmas. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ In a safe place, where? Well, I've understood and will not pry further. But this is the first time something like this has happened in our family. In our family, however, it's happened often, and it's not a disgrace. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Season's Greetings. ~ Season's Greetings. ~ Merry Christmas. ~ Merry Christmas. Season's Greetings, dear. To the table. Oh, look how beautiful the table is. Ah, it's really Christmassy. Tristano...Dad goes there. We're all sitting at the table. ~ Need help? ~ No, thanks. We could invite Guerrino over. Why not? But we can't invite him by himself. We should invite the whole family. Surely they would feel uncomfortable. As they say, Easter with whom you want and Christmas with your folks. Who is Guerrino? A street child. For Guerrino we could make a nice Christmas present. OK? Now, let's see what has the grandfather given to the brave housewife. ~ Here it is. ~ How wonderful! Look, Fernanda, how many things can be made. Fruit juices, mayonnaise, eggnog, pink meat, ground coffee... Enough with these photos already! Mama, don't you know that it's 100 percent useful? It's time you went to sleep, it's after midnight. ~ Come on... ~ But, hey, Mama, it's Christmas, come on. ~ It's late, come on. ~ I don't want to go. But, yeah, come on. ~ Say goodnight to Dad. ~ No. Come on. Be nice. Oof! Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Fernanda, would you fix me a chamomile? It seems I've eaten too much. Are you tired? No. Why should I be? You look wrecked. Maybe because I'm pregnant. What? Maybe because I'm pregnant. Damn! Did you have to spit it out like that? And how should I tell you? Are you sure? Sure. This we dedicate to Eugenio. I'm sure he wants a little brother. Instead I've decided to get an abortion. Are you crazy? Do you see that I exist? I exist! Placemats. Vessels. Look! But what do you think you're doing? You don't think that I really exist. If I didn't do it this way, I wouldn't exist for you. Women don't exist. ~ But what's all this shit? ~ I didn't say shit! You said first off a brother, that's the last straw. Never mind the chance of a sister. ~ Ah, OK. But don't take words literally. ~ Words? You, macho, give your macho son... another macho that I am responsible for giving birth to. No, but you don't give away anything to anyone because this time I'm getting an abortion. Do you understand? Fernanda... I'm not your cow, with children I do what I want. Do you understand? Enough. Stop talking crap and shit. Crap and shit, "shit" is the only word you know! What shit are you going to say? Now enough. Calm down, be reasonable. I don't want to be reasonable. My head's ready to explode. Then get cured. Talk to a psychiatrist. You think I'm just a nuisance? You've left me all alone all Christmas. Go to your father. He's an imbecile like you. Calm down! Do it at least for Eugenio. You even toasted without me! ~ Just because my place is in the kitchen. ~ I just realized it later, you must believe me. ~ You don't realize anything. ~ But what shit should I realize, then? For months I've been playing the role of good little housewife. Just to see how far you get. ~ Calm down, eh. Calm down! ~ Enough! I wanted to see if you'd come to understand. But you understand nothing, nothing. ~ You're just acting out the role of an old-fashioned husband. ~ But what's all this about an old-fashioned husband? This evening you've crossed the line. The experiment has failed. Do you want to leave? Goodbye. I'm leaving. You'll never see me again. I'll be going back with the grandparents? ? I wonder how it happened, but it is so... ? now I'm here. ? But I in the meantime I pass from one hand to the other. ? I eat, I drink, I sleep, but I do not know why. ? And I would go away... ? with no one to take care of me. ? I wonder how it happened, but it is so... ? now I'm here. He's wrong sometimes, I'd say. I'd say he's never been trained. Police station. Yes. Where? On Anagnina street? But are you sure it's him? Bring him here. Is he unharmed? He's unharmed... He doesn't want to come? Yes, now the father will take custody. Yes, he's here with me, here with me. OK, I'll order it right away. They found him about fifteen miles from here. He's in a barn. The farmer telephoned our regional colleagues... He says he won't come, but he's unharmed. This I've been assured of. He wanted to see the birth of a cow. Can I go there? I really saw the birth of the bull, I saw him get out of the cow. Yes, OK. But now let's go. You know we've been on tenterhooks all night? You could have given out a sign of life. Now come on, we'll take the first plane to London. I don't feel like going to England. What? I don't feel like going to England. But, how can you say you don't fell like coming to London? Now, don't make my life difficult. So...maybe you don't want to because of Milena? Milena? She doesn't love me any more than Mom does. Well! But...where do you want to go? The owner said I can stay here as long as I want. When I saw him I said: What's your name? Should I tell someone? But he didn't want me to let anyone know. I offered him to let him eat and sleep, but he wouldn't listen. ~ He doesn't want to go to England. ~ Why he doesn't want to go to England? In these circumstances it seems inappropriate to compel him. You...What do you say? You are completely wrong. You...Can't you? ~ We're about to leave for Australia. ~ That's the way things are. I can't impose this thing on Tristano. ~ There are some good boarding schools. ~ Hey! Mom, it's better this way. Just give the time to settle myself in Milan. And how do we do that? Your sister is waiting for us. We've already bought the tickets. Here he is. Eugenio, where are you going? Turn around, Eugenio. Uh, how beautiful it is. Look how small it is. ~ How many days old is he? ~ Born last night. Look, look, look. How touching he is. Come, come. The calves are always so tender. And to think that we eat them. How cruel we are! ~ How long is the gestation of a cow? ~ Nine months. Ah, like women. But when does the mother suckle him, the cow? Now we separate them from the mother at birth. ~ But why not leave him with his mom? ~ He'd drink all the milk. ? I wonder how it happened, but it is so... ? now I'm here. ? They didn't want me, or maybe they did... ? now I'm here. ? And I'm going for a walk to see... ? if I like the thing at least a little. ? I look at myself to get to know... ? if for the others I am too much, or maybe not. ? I wonder how it happened, but it is so... ? now I'm here. ? Now I'm here. ? Now I'm here.
