I wish you would pick up your phone. You know you get this from your dad. Trying to turn off your emotions and shut yourself out. We all miss her, John. But we need to work together on this. Especially you. No amount of silence or anger or resentment toward yourself is ever gonna bring her back. Your dad and I worry about you and what you... Just please, don't try to drown this out with a bottle, John, please. I love you, son. And I hate that you're back to work again already. So, just please be careful out there, okay?

Mac, Mac, come here. I'm glad one of us is okay. Hold on, buddy, hold on. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay, stay. This is Captain Rauge. Calling in a mayday due to touchdown on planet D-14. Uh, upon atmosphere penetration, lateral vibration must've caused some sort of short in phase-detractors. Analog thrust got me down here, but it's not gonna be enough to relaunch. Long story short, I'm gonna need a jump. I'll waste no time in finding an alternate power source as this planet's already given me some concerns. Number one, being I landed in the desert, and now I'm in the snow, less than three mile away. The time is... Shit, come on, Mac. I guess that means it's supper time, huh? You know, I was saving these for an emergency, but I guess this constitutes an emergency, huh? Easy there, Chef Ramsay. What if I told you this might be the only food on the planet? There, that's what I thought. Truth be told, I don't know what to expect. You see, the problem is, that a normal planet is shaped like this. Nice and round, fixed axis, consistent mass. Predictable, right? But Ellipse was spit from the mouth of a wormhole about four years ago and because of the way it came out, it came out shaped like this, like an egg. Now, we landed right here. The point with the most mass under our feet. Now, with no axis and no consistent G-force, it essentially spins like the Scrambler at a carnival. You can pretty much forget everything you know about weather patterns, gravity, and time. There's a myth that it's the fountain of youth. Well, we know that's not the case. We got to get the hell outta here. Well, judging by the gray hair on your beard, and the fact that pee dribbles down my leg, long after I'm done urinating, I'm gonna say that crash took about six years off our life. Now for me, it's not a big deal. It's not ideal, but I'll manage. For you, however, that's damn near half your life. Could've been a lot worse, you know? A few more minutes over there and, you have no idea how much you mean to me right now. I can't let anything happen to you. Come on. Let's hike a little further, then we'll make camp. You hear that, right? I'm hearing it. There's some kind of moisture here. Let's keep walking and see what happens. Next we got to find one made of beer. Come on, Mac. Say, Rauge, sorry about your recent loss. Tell you what, why don't you, you know, get away for a little bit. Go deep into space and while you're out there, just snap some quick photos of an egg-shaped planet. Nevermind that the North Pole's a volatile freaking' mega-magnet that's gonna suck the life outta you and your canine partner. Oh, gee, Captain, no foolin'? Say, which vessel do you want me to take? Ah, you know, just take the most dilapidated piece of crap we got in the yard salvaged from World War I parts. You know, the throttle sticks a little bit and every once in a while, the phase-detractors give you a little trouble, but you give 'em a whack with the hammer. They'll settle down for ya. Oh, gee, Captain, that sounds dandy. Say, before I go, you think I could maybe get some of those leather-bound laces? You know, the kind that don't come untied when you're five billion miles from home? Ah, sorry, Rauge, just not a chance in hell. Ah, well, hey, you know what? You tried. Let's go. What? You know, you could strike up a conversation any time you want if you don't wanna hear me talking to myself. You know, I did get myself thinking though. If this planet really is a giant magnet, which I suspect it is, then by that right, the other pole, should have the opposite effect, no? I don't know. Maybe this prick really is the fountain of yo, oh! What the hell? Either gravity's playing tricks on us or you should let me know if you see a free clinic nearby, you know, just to be safe. What's the matter, buddy? Is your collar bothering you? Yeah, I know this gravity's giving me an intergalactic creeper, that's for sure. Mmm, dog breath. I've said it before. I'm probably gonna say it again. We got to get the hell outta here. Yeah, I don't like that shit either. Captain Rauge to base, come in. Engineering department, please. This is Williams. Vessel number and ID please. Williams, just the guy I was looking for. I already sent you your service order and flight path, John. Well, check you out. Yeah, us engineers aren't half-bad after all, huh? Anything special I need to know? It's pretty straightforward. Just survey and snap a few photos and head home. Yeah, well, this flight plan sucks. It's gonna take me three days. Stick to the plan, John. You ain't pulling that cowboy crap on my jobs. That is a big negative. I'll be going over to the north side of Ellipse. John, we've got no understanding of Ellipse's gravitational polarity. You're talking about shaving two hours off of a three day trip. Time is my most valuable asset, my friend, and I've got a girl back home that's worth every penny. Oh, speaking of which, she's beeping in now. I got to go. No, no, Rauge. Oh, oh, losing you. Later, later. Babe, it's only been two hours. What, do you miss me already? Mom, what are you doing on Emma's ph... No. Hold on, hold on, slow down, slow down. No, no, no. Put her on the phone. I want to talk to her. Mom, mom, let me speak to her right now. Mom, no, don't tell me that. I just saw her. Put her on the phone. Put, let me, let me talk to her. No, no, let me talk to her right now. Mom, mom, put her on... You know, I'm starting to think those MREs must be packed with fiber or something. Mac, where's your manners? Whoo-hoo! Mac. Mac, come on. Come on. You know what this is, Mac? This is half a volt. That's all it takes is 12 volts, 16 amps. 20 or 30 more of these and we've got ourselves a battery, my friend. Think we're gonna need some fresh ones, though. But as far as these bad boys go, I got other ideas. ♪ I'll give you shelter, baby ♪ ♪ I'll take away every ounce of pain ♪ ♪ I'll give you shelter, baby ♪ ♪ You know it looks like it's gonna rain ♪ ♪ I'll give you shelter, baby ♪ ♪ I'll take away every ounce of pain ♪ ♪ I'll give you shelter, baby ♪ ♪ If you come in from the rain ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ ♪ Come and take my pain ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ ♪ Come and take my soul away ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ ♪ Come and take my pain ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ ♪ Come and take my soul away ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ ♪ I'll give you shelter, baby ♪ ♪ I'll take away every ounce of pain ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ ♪ Come on, take it ♪ 3%. I wonder what 3% will do. Well, maybe that's a good stopping point. Goodnight, Mac. Eh. I just work better when I'm drunk. Guess all that's left is to climb a tree, huh? You know, that really wasn't as bad as you think it would be. Sorry, buddy, but your little heart can't take it. I'm gonna have to do this one alone, okay? Mac, no! No! Get! Go! No! Mac, why would you do that? Why would you do that? That was stupid. Don't be stupid. Mac. I can't lose you. You scared me. You scared me. Bad dog, bad dog, Mac. Come on. Our attempt today to regenerate the phase-detractors was a failure. What I didn't account for was the crest of Ellipse's affect on all living things. Nothing survives on Ellipse, nothing but rocks. I'm gonna have to charge a power source off-location, which means more rations, more fruit, and if it works, another three to five years off my life. What's the point? You know, there's a fifth of Vodka in the ship that might not have broken on impact. Next time you're headed that way, I'd really appreciate it. Shit. Get. Get out of here, will ya? Get! Go! Battery 13%. Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! John. John. John. John. John. Where were you? Where were you? Where were you? Emma? Emma? Where were you? Please hold me. Emma. I'm coming, baby. Where were you? I'm coming, Emma. Where were you? No, no. Why weren't you there for me? Mac. Mac. Mac. Mac. You can pretty much forget everything you know about weather patterns, gravity, and time.

Phase-detractors, off. I buried the last part of you I had today. 15 years. 15 years was all he was granted in this world. I never talked to anybody about what happened on Ellipse. My official report deemed it a DNE, Do Not Explore. We live in a world where we fight over every group of weeds or patch of dirt we can plant our flag on. Knowledge of this power would take more life than Ellipse could ever give. I find it funny that the metric for a quality life is the years we breathe and not the love that we give. Mac knew that. Hell, all dogs do. Not a minute of his life was wasted on the worthless emotions we indulge in, smart enough to know he had an unlimited amount of joy to give, but only so much time to give it. 15 years weren't taken away from me on Ellipse. They were given to me. Not just the years, but the ability to face time, the understanding that it isn't a countdown of minutes or hours, but a diary, a blank book that we fill up as much as we can before we leave. Tonight, I begin to fill your pages. Tonight I see my time with you for how long it really was. Tonight, I am in control of my dreams. ♪ One foot now on the pedal ♪ ♪ Gotta run now from the devil ♪ ♪ Going max now from the metal ♪ ♪ First place, I got my medal ♪ ♪ Pick a fight now, with the devil ♪ ♪ Going up now another level ♪ ♪ Looking down at the peril ♪ ♪ Going up, going up another level ♪ ♪ Adrenaline ♪ ♪ Rush through my veins ♪ ♪ Take me away from the pain ♪ ♪ I got a monster ♪ ♪ Inside of me ♪ ♪ If it won't let me go ♪ ♪ It won't let me be ♪ ♪ I got a monster ♪ ♪ Inside of me ♪ ♪ If it won't let me go ♪ ♪ It won't set me free ♪
