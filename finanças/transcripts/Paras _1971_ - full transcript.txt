Look upwards and star barking if you are feeling hungry, dear Bela. What are you laughing for? All your teeth will be broken if I use this stick. What are you doing? What is someone gets hur? What else will happen? They will use arificial teeth. Go home, I will return after selling these flowers. Come quickly, Else I won't talk to you. Why are you standing before me in the middle of the road? Move aside. I have bought a gift for you on behalf of Arjun Thakur. It's made of pure gold. It seems to be very expensive. Keep it in your house safely. How is that possible? I'll show you. - Tell me. Make your sister wear it and hand her over to Arjun. It's simple, you will get Arjun's wealth in exchange for your sister. Stop this nonsense. Shersingh's (lion ) whiskers will never fall off. You are not Shersingh (lion ) but Lomdisingh ( wolf). Cut off your moustache. Step aside. Take this unworhy girl. Brother! Where are you going? - Rascal ! Leave me. Watch it, the villagers have arrived. Run quickly. Come on, run quickly. Cowards! Why are you running away? I'll teach. . . you a good lesson if you misbehave with my sister. Let's go. The honour of the girls in this village is in danger. You will have to make Dharam understand. I've given up. All right! I'll talk to him. Dharam, I am telling you once again. . . Get her married. I must find a suitable groom for her, uncle. What are you talking? My nephew Sohan will. . . be arriving from the city. I think he'll be suitable. Uncle is right, Dharam. These rogues stay in this village. Come on, Tommy. Your photograph lacks the qualities embodied in you. Brother you will only have this photograph to admire. What are you talking? I've impressed her mother. She has promised me that very soon Barkha will. . . enter into my life just like a spring season. Then will you stop working for Mr. Munna? How can I work for that mad fellow? Bhavani, I am waiting for the old man to die. Afterwards I will attain this post and. . . This fool will stand in my place. You will get lot of wealth from your in-law's. After all such a huge propery. . . Consider your brother too. - What are you talking Bhavani? You are dear to me more than my life. We will divide the wealth which I will get from my in-law's. Mr. Thakur! Did the beautiful girl accept it? - No sir. She took a dangerous form due to it. After that her brother arrived on the scene. So you have come after being thrashed by him. Yes. - Rascal ! Why are you hiding your face like an eunuch? Remove your hand. Where has the other side of your moustache disappeared? Bela has cut it with a scissor. Rascal ! You couldn't compete with a girl despite being so heftily built. You let her cut your moustache! Shave off his moustache. He will not keep the moustache in future. What is it? - Was Baldev able to cut. . . the crops from the field? - He had taken the men for it. But Baldev and his brother under the influence of Dindayal stopped them. Dindayal is acting smar nowadays. Come with me. Get aside. - Please spare me. Greetings, Mr. Thakur! Dindayal, what does a wolf do when he commits a mistake? How can I answer, Mr. Thakur? You are more sensible than me. I am also more powerful than you, Dindayal. Just think over it, you have small kids. What will be their fate if you die before time? Mr. Thakur, don't give me such a warning. You deceive illiterate farmers at the time of lending money. Despite paying the money, you are cutting our crops. It is a democratic country, now you cannot do as you desire. How dare you give us the warning ! Control yourself Bhavani Singh. You are the servant to the landlord, not a landlord. Otherwise we will deal with you in a very harsh manner. What did you say? Mr. Dindayal is right. After all he is elder to us. You should not insult such a famous leader of. . . the people, inspite of being an ordinary servant. Mr. Dindayal, forgive us. We have committed a big mistake. Let's go. Come Bansi, star cutting your crops. Wait! You'll move ahead. Dindayal's neck is beautiful. The beauty fades away very quickly. Brother shall I chop his head off? - No. Cut off the head slowly which is situated above the neck. Neither he should be aware of it nor the villagers. Save me! Save me! God Almighty! Master, younger master has killed Dindayal. Distribute sweets. - But he has been caught. Advocate at present I am paying you Rs. 10,000 /- I'll pay you Rs. 50,000 /- the moment my brother is released. I'll risk my life for the sake of Rs. 50,000 /- It's in your hand to save my brother's life. Yes. More than me, it's in the hands of those two witnesses. They were present when the murder took place. The one who are the cause for your brother's arrest. Try and bring them to me. If they can change their statement in any way. . . Then your brother will be rescued without any accusation. Aunty! Uncle is arriving with the groom. Is Bela ready? She is not ready. - What happened? Ask your dear sister. Bela, you are crying. What is the matter? Nothing serious. - Won't you tell your brother? I'll not get married. You are a fool. At present you'll will just select each other. You'll will get married only when you give your consent. I know it. - What? Now you consider me to be a burden. You want to remove me from this house by getting me married. All right! Get me married today itself. I will walk out of the house myself. My parents would not have forced me to get out of. . . the house if they were alive. What did you say? I have never considered you as my sister. I have brought you up just like my daughter. You are saying that I consider you to be a burden ! Aunty this marriage will not take place. Tell Uncle to leave. Have you gone out of your senses? Will you behave according to this foolish girl's wish? A daughter has to get married some day. You can go. I'll manage it. What's the matter? You've crushed your brother's feelings who loves you very much. For your sake he didn't get married. He thought that his wife, a stranger would harass his sister. Am I stopping him from getting married? People will disgrace him if he gets married. . . before getting his young sister married. He cannot get married until you get married. Don't you want your brother to have his own family? Don't you want a sister-in-law? Kids to carry on the family name? Brother! Everything will be done according to your wish. I don't expect anything. I consider you a burden. Isn't it? Do whatever you please. I will not interfere. Brother you resemble a girl whenever you get angry. Stop this foolishness. Why did you say that I consider you a burden? What should I say brother? Only a sister can. . . understand the feelings of another sister. I would have expressed my feelings if it was possible. I think of no one else except you. You are my god, my mother. . . You are my father too. Brother, you are everything to me. I can think of anything but can't think of getting separated from you. Brother whenever the matter about my marriage is discussed. . . I feel as though people are trying to separate my brother from me. Foolish girl ! A sister has to leave her brother some day. It is a tradition. You belong to another family. We've to send you there one day. Aunty help my daughter to get ready. Bring her inside. Why are you feeling shy? Come on, face us. Shall we get them married the next Friday? No Uncle, the marriage will not take place so soon. She is my only sister, I'll get her married in a pompous way. Wait till the next harvest. It's a question of few months. I'll get her married as soon as I get the money. Mr. Arjun is calling you. - Oh ! My god. Why has this stupid come here? - Dear don't say like this. Be calm, I'll go and meet him. Greetings! Mr. Thakur. We are forunate that you have arrived at our place. Welcome! Have a seat. Greetings! Are you fixing your sister's marriage? Congratulations! Lakhansingh I've arrived here on an auspicious day. Yes sir. - When are you getting her married? Mr. Thakur, marriage and death for a poor person are similar. They can perform both the things only when they have money for it. We'll have money when the field yields the flower crops. Then the marriage will take place. Oh No! Then why are you'll waiting for it? Dharamsingh, I'll give you whatever you need at present. Give them Rs. 10,000 /- - Yes. Take it. - You are great. Diamonds without asking. . . and not even alms, when sought! Your fate has changed Dharmu. You've to greet Mr. Thakur. Uncle keep quiet. Mr. Thakur can I ask you. . . the reason behind giving these alms to me? Alms! These are not alms. I give alms to the one who beg. I've given you without being asked. What have I to do in exchange of it? Nothing ! You just have to say in the cour that. . . You have not seen Bhavani Singh committing the murder. . . The dead body was lying there when you went to that place. . . And Bhavani was just standing there. But I have seen Bhavani Singh committing the murder. It's true, I don't deny. Mr. Thakur, I will tell the cour what I have seen. You'll profit if you change some words. I cannot barer my integrity for this meagre profit. Mr. Thakur you cannot bribe humanity and truth. You can leave. Uncle, keep quiet. Lakhansingh, king Harishchandra is born for the second time. He also has suffered for he always spoke the truth. Yes sir. - But what will be the fate. . . of the poor fellow? Dharma, his false smile is going to ruin you. You have entangled yourself into a big problem. There is still a chance. Go and seek his favours. Uncle, I'll only seek favours from the god and not from a devil. Don't worry. I'll teach the disciple of Harishchandra a very good lesson. What's your plan? - I'll question him in such a way. . . in the cour that he will get confused. He will tell a lie even if he doesn't desire. Swear on the holy book( Geeta ), you will speak the truth. Yes. - Then why are you lying and being. . . the cause for hanging that innocent person to death. I consider that to tell a lie is an offense. Yes, this is your greatest lie. Didn't you give the statement to the police. . . that you are an eye witness to Dindayal's murder? This is the truth. This is a lie. If Dindayal was murdered before you. . . Then why didn't you stop the murderer from doing so? You could have caught him after he had committed the murder. It was possible you would have stopped him from committing it. I was at a distance. - Point to be noted my lord. On one hand he says that he is the eye witness to the murder. On the other hand he says he was at a distance when the murder took place. But I had arrived there. - You arrived after the. . . murder took place. Don't question the witness by giving him a warning, Mr. Verma? Do it in a smooth manner. - Yes, my Lord. My dear friend, you had arrived there. . . But after the murder took place. Bhavanisingh is the murderer. - You can also be the murderer. Myself! - Yes, yourself. Because. . . only three people were present at the time of the murder. . . Yourself, your sister and Bhavani Singh. It can be possible, you have committed the murder and. . . You and your sister have got Bhavani Singh arrested for it. This is a lie. It is a false accusation on me. Judge, I have never lied in my life. No one is dear to me in this world except my sister. I swear on her and say that Bhavani Singh is the murderer. Do you want to ask anything else? - No. The cour is adjourned for the lunch. Advocate! My god ! Save me from this monster. Truth always wins. - The matter was not finalised. How do you say that the matter was not finalised? Didn't you see how I accused him of committing the murder? The fly will enter your mouth advocate. I have given you the money in order to save my brother. . . Bhavani Singh and not to create any scene. Don't worry, the case is not yet completed. I have rescued many murderers from being hanged to death. Let her sister arrive after the lunch. She is a child, not so intelligent. I will ask her questions which will make her shiver. . . She will fear. You had given the statement. . . You and your brother caught Bhavani immediately after the murder. After that you'll took him to the police station? Yes, we took him. - After being caught. . . did Bhavani Singh come with a cool mind to the police station? No, this animal did not come with a cool mind. It was not his marriage for him to come behind. . . us like a groom feeling shy. He was warning us all the time. What did he warn you? - He was saying. . . Dharma leave me if you want to live. Otherwise I will chop your head too. Watch his face. How dare he chop the head of my brother? Am I dead? Won't I chop your head before you do so? I don't know English. I'll give you a good reply if you communicate in Hindi. Hey girl ! Don't talk too much. Only give the. . answers to the questions which are being asked. I don't feel the need to chat along with him. Continue. -When the convict gave you the warning. . . Did you remain calm? - What are you saying? I did not remain calm. - What did you say? I said murderer! Committing murder is your family's business. How did you know about Bhavani Singh's family business? What's new in it? All the villagers know it. Are you sure of it. - Otherwise why will I tell you? You were always in that belief. . . That committing a murder is Bhavani Singh's family business. When you saw Bhavani Singh standing at the spot of murder. . . You believed that Bhavani Singh is the murderer. Considering it, you and your brother caught Bhavani Singh. And took him to the police station. Am I right? My foot! It is not so. Do you want to entangle me by asking confusing questions? I have seen him murdering with my own eyes. You have taken a swear in the cour for speaking the truth. You should not lie. - That is great. You talk of being a pious saint after committing several crimes. Pious saint! What do you mean? Advocate, it means that I am not telling a lie. You are forcing me to lie. I know it. - I didn't tell you a lie. What else are you doing since such a long time? You also tried to force my brother to tell a lie. Why do you ask such odd questions when you didn't watch the murder? You will not get a straight reply if you ask confusing questions. My lord, look at the way the girl is answering. What is it sir? - An advocate can ask. . . questions according to his wish during the case. One should answer whatever is known to him with manners. All right sir. You have given the statement, you are an eye-witness. . . to the murder. From what distance did you see it? From where did I see it? Advocate just assume, someone kills you at the. . . place where you are standing and I watch it from this place. Think and tell me the distance in yards. Who is this man? - It is not a human being. . . Tell the distance in feet and meters. Feet and meters! he chopped the head within seconds. Stream of blood was flowing there. I felt dizzy, watching it. Who will think of measuring it at that moment? What senseless questions are you asking advocate? You said that he chopped the head in a stroke of a sword. Yes. - But how is it possible. . . To chop off the head from the body in one stroke of a sword? I'm a girl, sir. Isn't it? - Yes. Give me the sword with which Bhavani Singh had killed him. Then? - Afterwards stand in front of me. Then what? - I will chop off your. . . head in a single stroke and only then shall you believe me. This witness can leave. Considering the proceedings of the case and the statement. . . given by the witnesses, it is proved that. . . Bhavani Singh alias Veer Singh has murdered Dindayal. Under Indian Penal code Section 302, convict Bhavani Singh. . . is to be hanged to death. ''Says the firefly. . . '' ''says the firefly something of interest'' ''Remember every word of what she says'' ''Try to figure it out, if you can'' ''Say yes, if you think it's true. Say no, if you think it's a lie'' ''Is it yes, or no? - Yes! ''Bless you all ! '' ''I wish I could kiss your cheeks. . . '' ''and rest my head on your chest? - No thank you ! ''This time around, I'll make love to you. . . '' ''thiry times in a month ! - How disgusting ! ''You are my Prince. Won't you give me any love? ''You ought to be ashamed ! '' ''Say yes, if you think it's true. Say no, if you think it's a lie'' ''Is it yes, or no? - Yes! ''Bless you all ! '' ''This firefly tells you something really interesting'' ''If you have tormented someone. . . '' ''if you have snatched somebody's happiness. . . '' ''If you and I, or anyone else, has sown a tree of thorns. . . '' ''how shall he expect it to grow fruit?'' ''He can't, can he? - No! '' ''It's an old tradition. You reap as you sow'' ''I hope you understand what I say now?'' ''Say yes, if you think it's true. Say no, if you think it's a lie'' ''Is it yes, or no? - Yes! ''This firefly tells you something meaningful'' Dharma the animals haveJ entered your farm. What? - The entire farm has been destroyed. Brother what has happened? Brother we are ruined. We have become helpless. Who must have done it? But Mr. Thakur, the engagement between Bela and my nephew is fixed. You can break it. How can it be possible? - Why can't it be possible? Lakhan Singh what were you telling me? I was saying, his nephew should be killed before the marriage. The problem will be solved once and for all. What a stupid fellow! He has even loaded. . . the rifle in order to shoot your nephew. No Mr. Thakur, have mercy. I will go and tell Dharma. . . That I do not accept this marriage. There is no need to tell him. You will also find him dead within seven days. Just like Bhavani. I had received his dead body. I had even performed his death rites. But no one will even know about his dead body. I will cut his body into small pieces. . . And will throw it in the river. Get lost! How dare will anyone harm my brother? I swear upon the goddess, I will offer his sacrifice to her. Why are you shouting? Why shouldn't I shout? Do I live on his earnings? Sit inside the house if you fear him. Let brother arrive, I'll tell him. . . To tell the landlord about the atrocities committed by his workers. The landlord has become old and his grandson is a bit insane. How will they listen to someone? After all Arjun is their relative. If this is the matter, I'll have to remove his. . . poisonous tooth before this snake bites us. You are talking insensibly. Dharma too will be hanged to death if he kills him. Dear it's a question of only a few days. He will not be at risk if he goes to the city. The rogues will not be able to harm if he is far away. Their anger will disappear with the passing time. They will forget about the revenge once they forget this matter. Then we will live peacefully. - Whom are you talking about uncle? Dear, I was telling her, if you take up a job in. . . the city, everyone will be able to live peacefully here. Everyone's thinking differ, uncle. I'll get whatever I have to get in this place itself. What will you get here? The farms have been ruined. There are no means of earning. How will you look after 3 people? That is true uncle. But how can I leave Bela alone? What has happened to me? What has happened to you ! Has nothing happened to you? Tell me again. Will you stay without me? - Why can't I? Am I a child? A child ! Look over here. You are crying. Isn't it? What are you speaking brother? Why should I cry? I will be happy if my brother stars earning again. Brother will become rich. I'll get a sister-in-law from a good family. Wait a minute! I had forgotten about it. It's good that you reminded me. Something has to be done. There are only a few days left for your marriage. Uncle, I will have to go to the city. I will have to work hard to save some money. Keep these belongings in the bullock car. Long live, son ! Shall I go? Your food. May God help you. Do send letters. - All right Uncle! Brother! Listen Bela, I cannot bear to see tears in your eyes. I will not go if you cry. - No, brother. . . I will not cry, you can go. But atleast tell me, when will you return? Your brother will definitely come to have the thread tied. . . from his loving sister on the day of Rakshabandhan. All right! You can go. ''In my sweethear's presence, I'll just stay quiet'' ''In my sweethear's presence, I'll just stay quiet'' ''But what might happen if my eyes do the talking. . . What?'' ''My eyes, overcome by an intoxication. . . '' ''if my friends get to know, what might happen? Oh what? ! '' ''But we do know already'' ''All nights. . . - What happens in the nights?'' ''all nights, my sleep vanishes, and taunts me'' ''When shall I spor the bridal dot on my forehead?'' ''The secrets of my hear, lie deep within. . . '' ''If my friends get to know what might happen? What. . . ?'' ''In my sweethear's presence, I'll just stay quiet'' ''It was a telling blow! - How severe was it?'' ''It was so severe, it set my hear on fire'' ''I felt shy every time I dreamt of my beloved'' ''My days I shall somehow pass, chatting up my friends'' ''But what happens if I can't manage to spend my night?'' ''In my sweethear's presence, I'll just stay quiet'' ''Quietly, secretly. . . - Quietly, secretly?'' ''Quietly, secretly, someone steals into my dreams'' ''I'm lost to myself, thinking about him'' ''Like someone crazy, I keep talking about him. . . '' ''but what happens if my secret is exposed?'' ''In my sweethear's presence, I'll just stay quiet'' ''But what might happen if my eyes do the talking. . . What?'' It is clear that you have saved her from falling off. But tell us, what were you doing over here? I had to come here due to your activities over there. What do you mean? - I mean to say that. . . Please move your car which is in the middle of the road. . . So that my bullock-car can go ahead. Hey! You can take the bullock-car from the other side. Hey! Don't you have the manners to speak to a gentleman? Come along with me. Did you understand? Come on, carry the luggage. Uncle is there a letter for me? My brother's letter? No my dear. - What! Barkha, my dear! Have you arrived? Today my daughter seems to be in a very good mood. Father, I have won the Tennis Championship in the college today. Is it? - Here it is. After all you are Thakur Prithvi Singh's daughter. Listen keep it carefully. - Yes. You will pamper her for no reason at all. Are you worried about anything else? Are you worried about a young daughter sitting at home? Mother, I am not sitting, I am standing here. Oh yes! She is standing. - You have pampered her. Foolish girl ! - Go to your room. Go to your room. - Mother, you always scold me. You always. . . - The generation is very bad. A single wrong step from your daughter will ruin the Thakur's fame. Shut-up! This will never happen. A tiger will die of hunger but will never feed on grass. We belong to the family of Rajputs. Until I am alive, I'll not let the family's name get defamed. But why should we even face such a day? Why not get her married before such a thing happens? You have selected a groom. - Yes. Who is it? - My sister-in-law's nephew, Arjun Singh. To hell with Arjun Singh. I was thinking of getting my. . . daughter married to Munna, the landlord's grandson. You have thought of getting her married to his servant, Arjun ! This cannot be possible. - Mr. Munna ! But I have heard that he is mad. - His rivals must have said. I have seen him personally. - Have you seen him? You must have seen him 20 years back. You speak as though. . . you have seen him presently. I have finalised everything with Arjun Singh. I'll not let my daughter get married to an insane for wealth. How can you finalise anything? Only I've the right to take decision. Who is it? - Your father! You are right sir. Meet him, he is Dharam. From today he will work in our store & stay here. Greetings! - Take him to the room upstairs. Thank you sir! - No dear, it's immaterial. We can both be helpful to each other. Anwar make him familiar with everything over here. Come with me. This is your room. All right, I'll leave now. Bela, I have got a job. Now everything will be fine. Oh no! Dharmu's house has caught fire. Aunty! - How did the house catch fire? Oh no! A gun. Someone please help. - Fire! Get in. Beware! If you come out. Aunty, be careful. Look at the ceiling. I had the desire to rape you besides your brothers dead body. But all the desires of a human being are not fulfilled. That cowards has escaped. . . But I will definitely spit on his dead body. No! Murderer, how dare you spit on my brothers dead body! You can abuse me today, but in future the world will abuse you. Where shall you escape? - Leave me. Shut-up! Unworhy girl ! - Is this called decent behaviour? You must have seen a woman in the form of a prostitute. . . But not in the form of a Goddess. Today you shall see that too. Will you rape me? - No, I will not. Rascal ! You will rape me? ! Rascal, leave me. - Come with me. Leave me. Take that, you filthy scoundrel ! Rape me, eh? I will kill you if you try to rape me. You think women to be helpless. If you have the courage, come and dishonor me. Come and dishonor me. Wretched man ! I will kill you. A woman is dishonored not by stripping off her clothes. . . But due to her deeds. Your mother must also have breast fed you. . . You must feel ashamed for your deeds. I swear on god, I don't know anything. If anyone shelters her or files a repor against me. . . in the police station, then I will kill that person. I will burn this entire village. Sir, I have understood. - You can go. Yes. - Search the entire village. Burn the house which has sheltered that girl. I'll not spare Bela and Dharam. - Okay sir! Sir, Mr. Prithvi Singh has come from the city to meet you. I don't know Prithvi Singh. He must be Prithvi, the son of my friend Kunwar Mahendra Singh. Where is he? - He is sitting in the hall. Greetings! - Greetings! Be seated. - Thank-you ! How are you? - I am fine. You have forgotten us after your father's death. You are right. - This is not the matter. I always remembered you. . . But I was not able to meet you as I was busy in my work. No problem. Atleast you have come today. How many children do you have? - Only one girl. Sir, where is Mr. Munna? It's 20 years since I've seen him. It will be better if you do not see him. What will be the use, watching a depressed face? Depression ! Is he facing some kind of mental problem? Mental problem! I don't think he has got any thinking power. He always stars crying due to his negative attitude. I did not understand. - Just assume that some kids. . . are going to school happily. . . wearing good and clean clothes. What will be your feelings after watching them? I will feel happy. - But this will not be his attitude. He will cry. - But, why? He will star imagining. . . The kids are going in the bus. There are other vehicles on the road. Probably the bus will meet with an accident. . . All these kids who are happy will die on the spot. He will think about it and star crying. I have consulted many doctors but it is of no use. Sir give me a chance. Send Mr. Munna along with me. You will find him to be normal when he returns. How is it possible? - The fact is. . . Mr. Munna always thinks in a negative way. Whereas my daughter always thinks in a positive way. If they stay together, I am sure that. . . My daughter will make him feel happy. It might be possible that he will make your daughter cry. You are right. Do not worry about it. Call Mr. Munna. Yes sir. - Call Mr. Munna. He has gone for a wedding. - Wedding ! Why did you send him? He was persistent, he wanted to bless Badriprasad's daughter. Did you hear? He will ruin everything. Welcome! My daughter. . . - What has happened? What has happened? Stop crying. Why are you playing this sad tune on a wedding occasion? What can he do, Mr. Munna? Everyone is crying. Why are they crying? - Watching you cry. Fool ! What have they to do if I cry? Look at the flame. Look at the bride. . . I was thinking that if the bride gets burnt. Then this entire pavilion will catch fire. If this pavilion burns then everyone will get burnt. Ask everyone about their grief. Yes, I will ask them. Go and call the bride. - Yes, I will call her. Why are you crying? - Since you are crying. Watching me cry! - You are everything to us. I felt like crying after watching you cry. You stared crying after watching me cry, foolish girl ! Brother, all the men cry after they get married. But you have stared crying before getting married. After I saw you'll crying. . . I thought that you both love each other. I considered myself unforunate, that is why I stared crying. What! How dare you think about me in this way? I will not get married to such a boy. Hey girl ! What do you think yourself to be? We can find better girl than you. Take the procession back. You have broken the marriage by crying. . . Why are you crying again? - The marriage did not take place. Sir, nothing will go right till we are present here. Let us go home. - No, I will not go home. Hey! Come here. Go and tell my grandfather. . . I am depressed since the marriage did not take place. That is why I am going to a isolated place. I will not return till I overcome this grief. When will you return? - I am not aware of it. I don't know. What! The marriage didn't take place? - Yes sir. Why did that fellow go there? Have you heard it? Prithvi Singh, all your effors will be useless. You are right. - But, sir. . . What is the harm in trying? - All right. But I don't know when he will return. Send him to my house whenever he returns. Okay! - Good-bye! You had informed me that Barkha is getting married with Mr. Munna. What is all this? - It's Barkha's father's decision. . . not mine. I'll not let my daughter get married to that insane for the sake of wealth. I will decide about this marriage and you will be the groom. Marvellous! Now I will not complaint. Where is Barkha? - In her room upstairs. Father! - Not your father. . . but your would be husband. Who has whipped you? - I had been for hunting. . . in the forest, a tiger attacked me suddenly. I threw the rifle and got physical with him. We both had a good fight. I caught hold of his neck and strangled him to death. Then you woke up. - Don't you believe me. There's a difference between the tigers claw and a woman's nail. Woman ! What are you speaking? Barkha, you know that I consider it a sin to think of anyone besides you. I consider it a sin to think about you. Barkha, do not behave like this. If you do not accept me. . . Then I will kill myself. It's easy to speak about dying. But no one has the courage to die. If you do not trust my love then you can judge me. . . I will give up life easily only for you. When will it happen? - What did you say? Arjun, come and have your food. - All right. Let's go. - You can go, I am not hungry. Foolish girl ! You are refusing him inspite of him requesting you ! Come on. - Come on, let's go. Inspector, this is the store. - Are you the owner? No. But why? - What is the matter? He is the person who had supplied me the fake medicine. Did I give you the fake medicine? - Yes. What are you talking? I don't deal in such kind of business. Where is the bill? - You had not given me the bill. I didn't give you the bill ! Inspector, this man is lying. Liar! My son died due to your fake medicine. When I gave your medicine to that innocent child. . . His condition got deteriorated. Inspector, in the evening. . . people lit lamps in their house, but my light, my son passed away. Inspector, I think he is an agent of some other chemist. He wants to entangle a respected man like me. Sir, I think you are forgetting, this medicine. . . . Shut-up, idiot! Inspector, he gave this medicine in my presence. I didn't know that he supplies duplicate medicine. Inspector, this is a lie. - This is the truth. You supply fake medicines to people in order to earn money. There is a stock of this medicine upstairs. Beware! Do not try to escape. Arrest him, confiscate the medicine. What has happened? Are you fine? Who has hit you? Be careful. ''Atleast tell me, when will you return?'' ''I'll come to get the thread tied from you on the day of Rakshabandhan'' Aunty! Yourself! - Uncle, where is Bela? Where is Aunty? How did the house get burnt? Arjun has burnt your house. Your aunt died in that accident. Bela is missing since that day. - Uncle! Yes dear, the next day Arjun was searching for her everywhere. Truth has ruined you. You wouldn't have faced this day had you not spoken the truth. You wanted to become one like Mahatma Gandhi, Harishchandra. Have you fulfilled your desire? No one in this village will suppor you. It is good that those rascals are not in the village. Otherwise you wouldn't have been in a shape to return. He had told me very clearly that if I get my nephew married to. . . Dharma's sister then he will kill the groom there itself. I said that I will not get him married. I thought that your sister must be staying with you in the city. If you find her, get her married to someone else. Go away from here. If his men watch you here. . . Then even the innocents will suffer due to you. Go away from here. Who are you? What is the matter? Go away from here? Mahatma Gandhi had said that if you want to achieve anything. . . in life then always lead the path of truth. Long live truth ! The truth always win. This is a lie. He had told a lie. One does not gain anything with truth. It only leads to destruction and showers death to everyone. He was shot dead just because he used to speak the truth. He is talking insensibly. Do not believe him. Otherwise you all will be killed, you'll will be ruined like me. One has to have fame, money to live peacefully in this world. Fame, justice and even Lord can be achieved only with wealth. Yes sir. - Are all the arrangements done? Yes sir. - Mr. Munna must be welcomed. . . in a pompous way. He is our would be son-in-law. Mr. Raja has informed that he will reach here by evening. Listen, he can arrive at any hour by his car. Inform me the moment he arrives. You'll are sacrificing me on the alter of the family's prestige. I am not ready to be sold out like animals. I am educated, I know the difference between good and bad. Go and tell father that I am not ready to marry that insane. You are taking advantage of my love. You will have to abide by my decisions. Even at the cost of her life. - Mrs. Thakur! Do not speak like this otherwise there will be no one worse than me. I am concerned about Barkha's life more than you. . . But more than that I am concerned about my family's prestige. There is no comparison between the king( Munna ) and the servant( Arjun ). You are comparing Mr. Munna with Arjun Singh ! This will never happen in my presence. Sir! - What is it? A car is approaching towards the palace. Welcome Mr. Munna ! You are mistaken. I am not Mr. Munna. You are not Mr. Munna ! Stop playing the music. Who are you? - I am Mr. Munna's secretary. A secretary! Then why did you accept these garlands? I didn't accept it, you'll have forced me to do so. Remove the garlands. - Bend down. I had come to inform you regarding Mr. Munna. What type of information? Mr. Munna got down from his car on the way. . . He said that he will not travel by car, but will go walking. Walking ! - Yes. He said, in India many people travel by foot. Mahatma Gandhi used to travel by foot. Vinobha Bhave too travels by foot. I too shall travel by foot from today. He ordered me to return immediately and come only on his consent. Since you will be disturbed, I've come to inform you about it. Good-bye! - Good-bye! Wait! - Master wants to say something. How will I recognise Mr. Munna when he arrives here? No one amongst us has seen him. What if we get confused again? Sir, I forgot to tell you. He gave away his clothes to a beggar on the way. . . He is clad in that beggars soiled clothes. You will find him untidy, his eyes filled with tears. He will be looking depressed. He looks like a beggar. Beggar! - Yes. I will leave. He will arrive today at any hour in the night. Dharam, take the place of Mr. Munna. Tell them a lie. Rob this house in the night. Trace the whereabouts of your sister and make her happy. Get up. Beggar! Take it sir. - You'll are fools. Stop playing the band. Come inside. - Let's go inside. Soiled clothes, depressed face. - Untidy looks, tears in the eyes. What is your good name? Please tell us your name. You are Mr. Munna, isn't it? Dharam take the place of Mr. Munna. Tell a lie. Yes. - Mr. Munna has arrived. Mr. Munna has arrived. He is standing over there. How do you know that he is Mr. Munna? - He has said it. He said it himself! - Did he only say. . . Star playing the band. You are entering as though it is your father's house. Go away. Mr. Munna has arrived. - It's good that he arrived late. Otherwise the musicians would have considered him to be Mr. Munna. Mr. Munna has arrived ! Please come. He is our public prosecutor. He is the prince. Myself. . . He is Acharya Yodhraj, a renowned writer. Nowadays he is writing his latest book on Mahatma Gandhi. My friend, Mr. Dilawar Khan. No criminal can escape from his clutches. She is. . . Mr. Munna, she is my daughter Barkha. So you are Mr. Munna ! Yes, I am the one. - Shut-up, you fool ! Foolish person, you have climbed up, get down. I have restricted him many times but he does not listen. The next time you try to go inside, I will thrash you. Idiot! Mr. Munna have the food. No, please forgive me. Mr. Munna. . . - Please forgive me. I think Mr. Munna is not feeling well, please have your food. We will join you later. Myself. . . - Be seated. What's the matter? Mr. Thakur, I am repenting for the crimes I have committed. I have wiped off the principles from my life. I think he has suffered the stroke again. Mother was right. You cannot commit any indecent act. . . Because you are the heir of a very royal family. I do not belong to a respectable family, I am a swindler. You are right. I mean to say that he is under some false perception. Happiness if the only cure for this perception. Laugh and the whole world will laugh along with you. It's right, my son. Try to be happy. . . Marriage! - You are my would-be son-in-law. Son-in-law! What kind of a joke is this? - Don't you like Barkha? She is a very nice girl. How can I compare myself with her? I am no where in comparison to her. He is filled with modesty and decency. Get up and have your food. Hold him. Not me! Hold him. I am not feeling hungry. I do not want to go there. No problem, I will send the food in your room. Have it if you feel hungry. Come on, let's go. Go and get food for him. I will take it personally. ''Living with falsehood is worse than death. . . '' ''do not ever covet such a life'' ''To die for the truth is the way to life. . . '' ''Do not ever be afraid of the truth'' ''Listen, ye friends. . . '' ''there is no religion greater than honesty'' ''To love, for man, is the greatest worship of all'' ''That's the greatest worship of all'' Father. . . I accepted a wrong way for the sake of wealth. But today I have come to know. . . A human being can achieve wealth by telling a lie. . . But he cannot achieve peace. I don't need the happiness and wealth acquired by wrong means. I don't want all this. I will repent for my crimes. . . I will undergo the toughest punishment for it. Now I will never lie. I will speak the truth. in front of everyone. Yourself! I am not capable of facing you. I have deceived you. I am not Mr. Munna, I am Dharam. . . A farmer who has got no possessions in this world. I have only a sister, she too is missing. I am a swindler. - Do not say anything more. I have heard everything. A person who repents for his mistakes is not morally bad. This is your modesty. I will take your leave. Please forgive me. I'll not let you go. - What are you doing? You will not understand. . . For your presence has given me a lot of suppor. What! - I had accepted defeat in my life. Mother wanted me to get married to a swindler. . . And father wanted me to get married to an insane. After you arrived I stared feeling as though. . . I have got a new life. Only if I could shower you with happiness. But how can a helpless person be of any help to anyone? If you stay here then I can get rid of those two people. I am sorry, I can't stay here. Maybe happiness is not written in my fate. You want to go. Isn't it? You can go. I had thought of consuming poison before you arrived here. Probably after you leave from here. . . I will have to take it's suppor again. You will commit suicide! I'd die, rather than live with a swindler or an insane man. No, I will not let you do this. Leave it. Have you gone crazy? Get up! Were you sitting outside the whole night? Fool ! Why are you risking your life? You will die if you catch cold. Move behind. Stop the car. Who is he? - He is a mad fellow. He is sitting near the gate since yesterday night. He says he wants to watch Mr. Munna. Have you seen Mr. Munna? What happened? I think he is suffering from the cold. Watchman, give him the shawl. Let's go. Come on say, 'Long live Mr. Munna'. How can I praise myself? Are you thinking yourself to be Mr. Munna after wearing his shawl. Give it. . . now get lost. ''You are the one I love. So why do you keep away from me?'' ''Your love has led me into a maize, my love'' ''What sor of love is this, what new way do I see. . . '' ''the bee is flying away from the flower'' ''My youth is on fire. . . '' ''yet, why won't the moth come to me?'' ''At hear, I have always craved for your love, my love'' ''What sor of love is this, what new way do I see. . . '' ''Your love has led me into a maize, my love'' ''What sor of love is this, what new way do I see. . . '' ''My beauty is only for you. . . '' ''who else shall take care of me?'' ''Pick me up in your arms, hold me to your bosom. . . '' ''sorrow has engulfed me already'' ''I sought your suppor and you shake off my hand. . . '' ''Your love has led me into a maize, my love'' ''You are the one I love. So why do you keep away from me?'' ''Your love has led me into a maize, my love'' Brother! Hey! Where are you going? Brother! - Who is your brother? She is my sister. - Listen to me, stop. Get out. - My brother is inside, please call him. Do not meet her here. - What! She is my sister, Bela. Brother! What's the matter? Who is she? I am Bela, his sister. He is my brother. Brother! - No, he is not your brother. He is Mr. Munna. - No, he is my brother. Am I right brother? Brother why are you quiet? Tell them that I am your sister Bela. Brother, I've suffered a lot. This world has made me suffer. Aunty died, our house got burnt. Everything got destroyed. I would have committed suicide had I lost the hope to meet you. No, you are making a mistake in identifying him. He does not have any sister. You make her understand. Tell her the truth. - Mr. Munna, do you know her? No. No! You have sacrificed your sister's love for the sake of wealth. Brother, the bonds of this palace are strong. Isn't it? Brother, you couldn't break them. But you have crushed your sister's feelings. Watchman, take this mad girl away from here. Sir there is no need for you to drive me out. I will go. Brother, it's good that you have forgotten me. But I will not forget you till my death. May god keep you happy wherever you live. May god gift you with a long life. I will go away. I'll never return. He has stared crying again. Go and make him understand. Only if I had not listened to you. . . I wouldn't have to refuse to identify my sister. I have nurured that sister like a father. She is the only aim of my life. Today I have driven her off like a stranger. I am feeling ashamed. - I regret whatever has taken place. There was no other option beside it. I hate this kind of life. I do not want to live being Mr. Munna. I want my sister. I will l not be able to stay here for a moment. I do not want to be a barrier between a brother and sister. If I have separated you'll, I will even unite you'll. Come along with me. Brother! Do not cry. You are in such a bad state. Please forgive me. Do not crush my feelings, otherwise I will kill myself. No Bela. You are not aware of how much I love you. Today I have seen the love between a brother and sister. Only if I had a brother. - Consider me as your brother. Brother, yourself! - Yes. He is the same person. - What are you doing here? I came here when I saw her and you people here. Who are you? - I am the one. . . which you claim to be at present. What do you mean? - My name is Mr. Munna. Yes the same one, which you are claiming to be at present. You can claim yourself to be so. I have no problem. What will happen to you. . . When everyone will come to know about the truth. Mr. Munna I have not achieved happiness, but only sorrows. . . by telling a lie. My consciousness bites me for my misdeeds. I am suffering due to it. It's good that you have arrived. Come along with me. I will confess the truth in front of everyone. I will tell them that you are Mr. Munna and not me. Don't do anything as such. They will not praise you. . . if you tell the truth, but they will thrash you. I deserve it. - Do not speak as such. Your pair looks so good. I will not let this pair get separated. I will have to do something for you'll. Is there a railway track around? - Will you commit suicide? Yes. - It seems, your thoughts have flowed off with your tears. Your family members will recognise brother after your death. I had not thought about it. - Bela, don't talk as such. Speak him to him with respect, he is our landlord. Landlord ! Brother he was asking alms to feed himself. What's wrong in it? Nowadays all the big countries depend on alms. Have I committed a crime by begging? Do one thing. . . Be in my place. - Yes, it will be better. Are you happy? - But where will Bela stay? Do not worry about Bela. I'll take a house on rent for her. It's a good idea. One of my father's house is to be given on rent. Mr. Munna can come and take the house as a licenser. I will send my maid servant to stay with Bela. Come along with me. No, from the other way. He has arrived. Come on. Hold this. Are you a small child to keep on crying often? What has happened to you? Why are you crying? I have committed a sin. - Which sin did you commit? Mr. Thakur said, he will let his house only to a married couple. Then what? - I told him that I have got married. My wife stays with me. - What's wrong if you said. . . that you have a wife to take a house on rent? You are crying again ! - You can get married to anyone. What will be my fate? I will get defamed. Who will get married to me? - How will I know? If you don't know then. . . Why are you knocking your head like this, sir? Thinking about the children ! Mr. Thakur thinks that. . . you are my wife. What will I say if he. . . We will leave this place before he inquires about it. We will leave the place. Are there no other options? How did you arrive so soon? I got restless after watching the scene outside. What did you watch? -I saw Barkha in Dharamsingh's arms. Who is this Dharamsingh? - Your rival. What are you speaking? How can that rascal reach there? I don't know about it. He has become a rich man. He is staying in Barkha's house. - How can it be possible? Mr. Munna is staying there. - I cannot be mistaken. Do something or you will lose the wealth as well as the girl. Make arrangements for me to go there. First I will go to meet the landlord and then to Barkha's house. If whatever you are saying turns out to be true then. . . I will bury him alive. ''Your rosy lips are oh so lovely. . . '' ''they give me a glimpse of your love'' ''What else may I seek from the rosegardens? What. . . ?'' ''Your eyes are so beautiful'' ''They're my guiding stars'' ''What else may I seek from the skies. . . ? What?'' ''Your rosy lips are oh so lovely. . . '' ''Your skin has the glow of gold. . . '' ''it's where the sunrays rest'' ''There's a fragrance on your breath. . . '' ''your thick tresses are scented'' ''You are fragrance all the way, like the glitter of gold. . . '' ''what shall I seek from a forest of sandalwood now? What?'' ''Your eyes are so beautiful'' ''They're my guiding stars'' ''Ever since I have seen you. . . '' ''I have dreamed of becoming a bride'' ''With you, everything I lack in life shall be fulfilled'' ''Your love is my only adornment, my love. . . '' ''what reflection do I seek from a mirror now? What?'' ''Your rosy lips are oh so lovely. . . '' ''they give me a glimpse of your love'' ''Your face glows. . . '' ''like the first rays of Sun in the sea'' ''Your arms have so much of love to offer. . . '' ''in your arms, my hear finds solace'' ''Every word you utter is sweet. - Like a shower of love'' ''What have we to seek from the rains now? What?'' ''Your rosy lips are oh so lovely. . . '' ''Your eyes are so beautiful'' ''What else may I seek from the rosegardens? What. . . ?'' ''What else may I seek from the skies. . . ? What?'' ''What have to we seek. . . ? What?'' I have still not married you. No! No! Why did you enter inside? - I don't know. You entered the room and still you don't know the reason ! Please forgive me. - Hell with your crying ! Why do you always cry? - I can never stop crying. When a human being can perish, then why can't your crying attitude? What is your grief? - Shall I tell you? Yes, tell me. Don't cry, tell me. Will you get angry? - No, I will not. Since evening my hear is beating faster like this. Hear beat is fast! Yes, since it was beating faster I came besides you. The veins in my body stared shivering. After that you woke up and I came running outside. Again my hear stared beating faster. Hey wait! What's happening? How do you feel now? - I am fine now. Ms. Bela. . . - What is it? Can't you stay with me for the rest of the life? The whole life! No, it's very difficult. Who will bear to watch you cry for the whole life-time? Why should anyone get affected if I cry? Do I stop other people from laughing? Others will not be affected, But the girl who will spend. . . the entire life with you, will surely be affected. What do you mean by any girl? - You have stared again ! Aren't you that girl? I cannot bear to watch you cry for the life-time. I don't cry, my eyes make me cry. Let them cry. Stop babbling and go to sleep. Stop crying. Go to sleep. How can I sleep without crying? How is it possible, Mr. Munna is not at Prithvi Singh's place? Master, a very close person has given me this information. Mr. Munna is not there and a swindler has taken his place. I cannot understand this confusion. Take the secretary along with you and find out the reality. I will be restless until you give me the information. Master do not worry. I will return soon. Have your breakfast. Bela why are you crying? The size of the sweets is more than that of your mouth. These sweets will get stuck in your throat and you will die. Oh god ! What shall I do? How will the sweets get stuck? - What if it stuck? Then I will drink water. - What if it is still stuck? People will laugh if they hear you speak as such. This is not your age to cry. Only children cry. Go and wash your face. Strange girl ! She is behaving like a child. What happened? - Fire! Where is the fire? - It is over there. But that is the stove. What difference does it make? What will happen now? You will cook food on the stove. Why are you shouting? No, this fire will spread out in the whole house. One house after the other, then the entire society. . . Then the entire city will catch fire, then one city. . . after the other and then the whole world will bet burnt. Oh god ! The people in the whole world will get burnt and die. They will get burnt. - What are you speaking? Shut-up! Even the vessel does not heat up on the stove properly. . . Then how can the whole world get burnt due to it. What if it happens? - Why are you thinking. . . about the thing which will not take place. Calm down. What happened? - You have caught cold. When did I catch cold? - You have caught cold. What is the need to cry? - It's not a minor disease. You will suffer from fever and then Pneumonia. Then I will get depressed about the life. What will I do if you die? - Bela, what are you talking? Does any human being die of cold? - Yes. Bela listen to me. Stop crying. I can't watch you cry? - What happens to you if I cry? If you want to laugh, you can laugh. How is it possible that you will cry and I will laugh. Bela, you are not aware of how much I love you. I feel dejected when you cry. - Let it be so. I feel dishearened when I see tears in your eyes. Let it be so. - Please stop crying. No. - Bela, I will get ruined. Let it be so. - Bela, I will be destroyed. Let it be so. - Bela, I will die. You can die. - Bela, stop crying. No. - Stop crying. If this is your state in ten minutes. . . Then think of our state when you were crying since the past few days. What would have been the state of your family members? The relatives, servants must have faced such a disaster. Their lives must have turned to hell due to your habit of crying. Yes, it must have been. - It has become a hell. Bela, you have taught me a good lesson. I will never cry in future. You have given me a new life. Life is meant to be happy and not to lament about. I will die with a smile. Like this. . . ''Ladies and gentlemen. . . '' ''and kids'' ''In the lanes of all the villages. . . '' ''beat the drums and make it known to everybody'' ''Beat the drums and announce this in every village around'' ''A five-feet girl has whisked away a 6-feet strapping young lad'' ''Her gait is so seductive. . . like a fish in net'' ''There's a sway in her hips. . . she can't be more than 16'' ''She's beaten the best of them! '' ''A five-feet girl has whisked away a 6-feet strapping young lad'' ''Juicy lips, intoxicating eyes. . . she's sweet and cute all the way'' ''Tender as a bud, fair of skin. . . she's a swan without beaks'' ''This is the swan that has wooed another'' ''A five-feet girl has whisked away a 6-feet strapping young lad'' ''A horse and a mare were galloping away the other day'' ''Someone whipped them from behind and the mare raced ahead'' ''The mare had met the horse's gaze before she left'' ''I was stunned at how the mare had seduced the horse'' ''A mare worh little had swept the regal horse off its feet'' ''A five-feet girl has whisked away a 6-feet strapping young lad'' ''Beat the drums and announce this in every village around'' ''A five-feet girl has whisked away a 6-feet tall strapping young lad'' Greetings, Mr. Thakur! - God bless you all. Come in. How did you'll arrive? The master was worried to know about Mr. Munna. That is why I thought of coming to your place and. . . Oh ! Let's go and meet him in his room. - All right. Oh no! - What has happened? Danger! - What kind of danger? Tell me, what's the matter? - Go inside, I'll tell you later. You'll will get surprised after watching Mr. Munna. He has changed totally. - Everything will be cleared. We will watch it now. Dear they have come to meet Mr. Munna. Where is he? He is having bath. He is having bath. - No problem. . . we will wait for him over here. - How will you sit here? How can he change his clothes? - She is right, how will he change. Let us go and sit in the hall. It's all right dear. It's over one hour. What is Mr. Munna doing in the bathroom? I will go and see. - Why should you take the trouble? We will go and see. Where are you going? Sit there. Why did you stop me? - Mr. Raja has sent them. . . To know about this house and Barkha. You'll will stick to them, they will not be able to ask. . . He will not be able to give any reply. - It's right. Mr. Munna, please come out. Rascal ! Is it good manners to peep into someone's toilet? No. It was a mistake. - Give me the hunter. Now tell me, Who is the rascal? Is it me or yourself? - Myself. Who is a swine? - Myself! Who is a stupid? - Myself! Who is the rogue? - Yes, it's me. Mr. Munna, I just can't believe that it is you. Why can't you believe? First you always looked depressed but now you look so overjoyed. It's good to always be happy and to make others happy. It is good to drive away grief and sufferings. How was it? Where is your mouth? Then utter something. - It was marvellous. Now laugh. Not like this. Like I do. Both of you. . . Shut-up! Now you'll can leave. Hey crippled, idiot! Give my regards to grandfather. When will you return? - I will come when I desire. Tell grandfather to come and meet me. Where will you be? - Myself. . . I will be everywhere you hear laughter, except a mental hospital. Go away. Wait! Very soon I am going to get married. Marriage! - Yes. I will flourish. Go away. Wait! Tell grandfather to make preparations for the marriage. Go away. This fool will get married ! Did you meet Mr. Munna? - You have done a miracle. I'll have to inform master that Mr. Munna has agreed to get married. We shall leave. - Shall I accompany them to the door? I am indeed happy. - You will suffer later. Everything is messed up. The secretary and Arjun were pleased after meeting you. Yes. - What has happened to your voice? My voice. . . . - I could make out the difference. I thought it was someone else. Sometimes there is a misgiving. I am indeed happy to hear the news about the marriage. There will be no limit to the Master's happiness. He'll be happy. I had desired for a royal and respected family for my daughter. My desire is fulfilled. A mosquito has bitten me. From where have they come? Where is he lying dead? - Who is dead? Your father. - You are right. It is 15 years since he expired. - Shut-up! You are useless. You don't look after the cleanliness. there are mosquitoes everywhere. Look into this matter. Be quick. You have saved me by bringing the real Munna at the right time. What about the fact that I am in a problem at present? Oh yes! Please forgive us, come. A calamity would have struck us had you not come here today. The world is on one side while the wife's brother in on one side. I have considered her as my sister. The mosquitoes did bite your father. Isn't it? Return from the way by which you had entered. What are you talking? He was laughing. How is it possible? Did you see someone else? Even a dog can recognise his own master. Am I worse than a dog. He was into fits of laughter. He was laughing and he was also making others laugh. He has changed totally. - It is a miracle. Where is Arjun? - He left since he was not feeling well. That idiot had troubled me by talking some senseless things. What is it Mr. Thakur? - There is a telegram for you. Your grandfather is serious. Take Barkha with you immediately. There is no other woman in that house. Suppose that his condition. . . gets deteriorated, then atleast Barkha will look after him. After all he has got some rights over her. If the matter gets worst, give me a call immediately. I will reach there immediately with Barkha's mother. Okay! When shall I tie the sacred thread around your neck? When shall I get married with you? Whenever my brother says. - What is your brother refuses? He will never refuse. He loves me very much. He will do anything in order to make me happy. Why will he refuse our marriage? He will give his consent. No problem, come out. Only we two are present here. Go out. - Where shall I go? Why are you feeling ashamed? They are our relatives. Greetings! When did you arrive? You should have sent a telegram. How did you come? By bus or car? Oh ! You'll stay in this city. How are your family members? Are they fine? What are you doing? I'm not telling you. I am speaking alone. Why don't you speak Bela? There is no need to say anything. - It means you are ready to be. . . my brother-in-law, I mean you have accepted this proposal. We will see to it later. There is a telegram for you. The Master is serious. - This should've happened earlier. This is an 80 year back model. All the spare pars are worn out. The junk will give way one day. Bela give them the sweets which you have prepared. Then we will all go to see the junk. First you only thought about crying, now you think of food. People must be waiting for you. Bela is right, come on. -What if he passes away before we reach? Recite the name of the Lord which is the truth and rejoice. I have heard that the face of a person who is on death bed. . . depicts whether he was a noble man or a swindler. Let me too see my grandfather's face. Look at the way my grandfather's face appears. It looks as though an infant is sleeping in his mother's arms. Idiot! - Grandfather don't get up, you are dead. The dead do not speak. They always keep silent. I am not dead. I am alive. Grandfather, I know it. Secretary must have told you that I have stopped crying. You wanted to test me and that's the reason you acted of being dead. But I will tell you one thing, even if you die in reality,. . . I will not cry. - Hey! What do you mean? - This is because I am happy. I don't understand, how I should thank Prithvi Singh. Grandfather there is no need to thank Prithvi Singh. If you want to thank, be grateful to her. Who is she? - She is Bela. Is she Prithvi Singh's daughter? - This is Barkha, Prithvi Singh's. . . daughter and my sister. Sister! What's all this confusion? - This is confusion over love. Actually brother Dharam and sister Barkha love each other. I and Bela love each other. Did you understand grandfather. Yes, I have understood. Dear, you are a goddess. - Then I am the Lord. Shut-up! You have give me the happiness. . . which is very precious. Tell me, what is your wish? I will not hesitate even if you ask for my life. Grandfather, you are promising. This is a Thakur's promise. - All right. Grandfather this is Dharam, Bela's brother. Get him married to my sister Barkha. This is Bela's wish too. But how can it be possible? - Why can't it be? Shut-up! Prithvi Singh wants his daughter to get married to you. It's right grandfather, but Prithvi Singh considers. . . Dharam as your grandson, not me. What! - Grandfather this is. . . a long story, I'll tell you later. - Arrange for their marriage. . . as soon as possible. - Marriage! Prithvi Singh is a very obstinate person. It will be very difficult to make him agree for it. What about the Thakur's promise? Was it a joke? All right. Go and finalise the date of marriage. I cannot get married under this condition. I do not want to flourish on the basis of falsehood. It's not false. Doesn't Barkha know that you are Dharam? What is the use of it? I do not want to deceive Mr. Thakur. Even Mr. Thakur wants Barkha to get married to you. Why do you forget that according to Mr. Thakur, I am not a farmer. . . But a wealthy person who is the Lord of the province, that is you & not me. The fact is, it's you not me. - What difference does it make? There is a lot of difference. Nowadays a person is judged. . . by his wealth and not on the basis of humanity. Before getting married I will disclose the truth to Mr. Thakur. . . About my real identity. - You will spoil everything. Before leaving Barkha too had told you to remain silent about it. My love for her and my modesty are two different things. I have suffered once and I do not want to suffer again. Mr. Munna, I can lose everything but now I do not want to achieve. . . anything on the basis of falsehood. I am confused, how should I make you understand? Mr. Munna, I know that you are restless. . . to watch me live happily. Mixing a porion of elixir in a cup of poison. . . will not change it into elixir again. I will have to wipe off the falsehood from my life. . . for which only I am responsible. I am leaving. - Dharam listen. . . Let him go. - How can I let him go? Dharam wants to invite trouble deliberately. Everything will get spoilt if Thakur comes to know the truth. You have found your dream boy. It's his right. Why are you depriving him from his right? Don't you feel ashamed? - How else should we speak? He is a simpleton. - Let him get married to you. . . Then I will ask you, how simple was he? Leave me. Why are you'll troubling me? Barkha will be my wife and not Mr. Munna's wife. I will risk my life in order to attain her. She should be kidnapped before the marriage. What if she does not agree to get married to you even after it? I will force her to get married to me. Yourself! Why are you standing there? Come in. You have come at this hour! You've to come with the procession. This kind of happiness is not written in my fate. What are you speaking? If this marriage does not take place. . . Then I will get defamed. It's possible that you may get defamed due to this marriage. What do you mean? - I am not the one. . . which you think me to be. I. . . Mr. Munna. . . . - No. You will not speak anything else. No. Barkha I cannot suppress my inner conscience. I beg of you. - Let me tell everything. You will not say a word. Go away from here. Do not let me wander on the path of this falsehood. No. I will not let you disclose anything. Barkha, I do not want to achieve you by deceiving Mr. Thakur. What is all this happening? What is the matter? Mr. Thakur, I will tell you everything. What will he say? I will tell you everything. He is not Mr. Munna. . . But a swindler Dharam who is deceiving you as being Mr. Munna. What are you talking? - This is the truth. This is a lie. - Mr. Thakur this is the truth. I am not Mr. Munna. I am Dharam, a poor farmer. I have deceived you by telling a lie. No. - Move aside Barkha. He has defamed me. I do not spare the person who defames a woman. Move aside. Father he is innocent. I had told him not to disclose. However and whatever he is, I have accepted him. Before getting you married to this unworhy person. . . I will kill you. Father, you can kill me but please don't abuse him. Stupid girl ! Get lost. Today I will not spare you in any way. Mr. Thakur do not trouble yourself to do this. Let me do this auspicious thing. Don't hit him. No. Brother, what has happened? - Nothing. What has happened to you? - I am fine, Bela. He has thrashed my brother. . . Why are you staring? Whip this rascal. Swear upon my love, whip this person. Have you seen the movie, ' Ram Aur Shyam'? Have you seen it? - Yes, I have seen. What are you chewing? Throw it. In that movie, Pran had hit Dilip Kumar. . . Then Dilip Kumar hits Pran. Something was missing in it. I will complete the scene. Mr. Munna, you cannot hit Arjun Singh in such a way. Move aside Mr. Thakur, he has not whipped Dharam. . . But he has whipped me. He has whipped him because he has deceived me. Who has deceived you? Dharam has not deceived you. He has done a favour on you. - What are you talking Mr. Munna? If he had kept silent, married your daughter and if you came to know. . . his reality later, then what would have been your state at that time? He could have done anything with Barkha while staying in this house. He didn't do anything. He is a precious stone. . . which turns a metal into gold by it's touch. . . But it still remains a stone. Is it not enough that he has defamed me in front of everyone? He has disgraced the prestige of this family. Prithvi Singh the family's prestige is not so precious. Master, yourself! - I am right. He is also a human being like you. A human being is not considered great by his wealth and prestige. He is considered great by his modesty and decency. He is the most decent man amongst us. If you still desire wealth and a prestigious family. . . Then this is my will. I have declared Dharam as the legal heir to my propery. Heir! - No, master. . . Whatever you are doing is not the right thing. Mr. Munna is the heir to your propery, not me. Both of you are precious to me than my wealth and my own children. From today onwards Munna is not my only son. Even you are my son. Prithvi Singh I've come with. . . a proposal to get your daughter married to my son. Will you accept this proposal? Master, you have showed us the right path. Decency is more valuable than family's prestige and wealth. Barkha is not only our daughter, she is your daughter too. You can do as you desire. Indian woman's are great, The men here are fool's. Only the woman are the foundation of this country. Sister Barkha, come. . . - Beware! Do not move. Arjun Singh are you out of your senses? - Shut-up old man ! Barkha will get married to me. Take her away. I will kill you'll if you'll move ahead. Stop. - Leave me. Leave him. Do not make yourself a criminal by killing this rascal. Inspector this is Arjun Singh. - Arrest him. Hold him. Take him away. Mr. Thakur, my sister. . . She is fine. The Doctor has treated her. The bullet had hit her shoulder. There's nothing to fear. Priest, the ceremony there is on the verge of getting over. You are still stuck up with reciting the phrases. Priest, do it soon. You have slowed down instead of doing it quickly. What is the use of this money? - This is because. . . There is corruption in the entire world. Get us married before the audience disappears. Be quick.
