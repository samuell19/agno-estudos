[GUN FIRING] [DIAL TONE DRONING] [DIALING] ROSWELL: Hello, Pat? This is Roswell Gilbert. Will you tell Gene Hudak and John Klinker that I... That I just shot my wife? [SIREN BLARING] MAGNANO: Charlie, 301, go ahead. DISPATCHER: Possible signal five, 5100 North Ocean Drive. I had no alternative, John. The doctors couldn't help her, and the hospitals wouldn't take her in. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] I just shot my wife. I shot her with my nine millimeter. I shot her in the head. Stay with him. What about a lawyer, Ros? Don't you think we ought to contact a lawyer? Well, I don't know anybody down here. KLINKER: Why don't we call Mr. Ferris? The attorney for the condominium association. I'm sure he'll recommend someone, a good lawyer. Oh, yes, Mr. Ferris. Call him. It's my duty, sir, to advise you of your rights under the Miranda statute. I'm aware of my rights, Officer. I have to read them to you just the same. I realize that I broke the law. You have the right to remain silent... I shot my wife. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. I loaded my gun...You have the right to an attorney. ...went into the living room where she was... ...and have him present... ... lying on the couch....while you're being questioned. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] REPORTER 1: Mr. Gilbert, how long did you and your wife live in the Fort Lauderdale area? REPORTER 2: Mr. Gilbert, over here, one question, please. PHOTOGRAPHER: This way, this way. REPORTER 3: Are you going to jail or the hospital? REPORTER 4: Where are you taking him? Take it easy now, you hear? Yes, I hear. MAGNANO: You okay back there? Yes. I've been agonizing over this for a month, Officer. I was responsible for resolving this. The doctors couldn't do anything. I had to end her suffering. You take it easy, huh? Easy. Ha! I don't think anything will ever be easy again. For us, for Em and me, we... It should have been in Spain. We had a hell of a good life there. Belonged to a club, had a lot of friends from everywhere. It's funny. MAGNANO: What is? The Golden Years... That's what they call it when you reach my age. The Golden Years. ROSWELL: More like brass, wouldn't you say? Not real gold if they can tarnish so badly so quickly. The Golden Years. EMILY: Well, I don't think we have to play out the rest of the hand. Oh, not again. She knows every card we're holding. Well, you have four small spades. And you, Jane, have the four of diamonds, the eight of hearts, and the nine of spades. Don't you ever lose? Memory, my friends, is the ammunition of the really good bridge player. Oh, gotta get my man. See you tonight at the dance. You betcha. Down, gentlemen, down. Em, you finished early. Well, I needed some extra time to argue you into a black tie for tonight. Oh, come on, Em... Roswell, this is not an optional dance. It is black tie, right? MAN: Right. Make him look civilized, Em. Friends... Ready to go? I need another half-hour to settle the problems of the world. Granted. If you climb into that dinner jacket without a complaint. Well, that sounds fair. Witnesses, witnesses... All right, I'll walk for a while. Mmm-hmm. Oh, Em?Hmm? It's that way. The exit's that way. Oops. Em? Puss, will you come up here, please, and help me with this damned noose? Well, look at you, mister. Where might you be going? Hmm?Well, what are you all dressed up for? What am I... Well, isn't the dance tonight? Dance? Yeah, at the club. Tonight? Well, that's what you said this afternoon. The invitation said tonight. You sent them out, you're on the committee. Well, then I'd better get dressed, hadn't I? [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] I love the way you do that. What?Dip. Remember what they called you in college? No.I do. What?The Big Dipper. Oh, they didn't.They sure did. Em?Yes? You okay?I'm fine, Ros. Then what the hell made you forget about the dance tonight? Well... If you quote me, I'll deny ever saying it. But I guess I'm not a spring chicken anymore, huh? Come on, give me a dip. Oh! Oh, neither are you. [BOTH LAUGHING] All creamed and rubbed and smeared? My God, Em, you're going to bed. Yes, with you. Gotta hide these wrinkles. Oh...Do you want some milk? No, thanks. I'll be back in a minute.Okay. [EXCLAIMS] Oh! [THUDDING] EMILY: Oh...Em? [EMILY GROANING] Emily! Oh, my God! Emily, I'm coming, dear, I'm coming. Oh... Easy, easy, easy, easy... What happened? I don't know, I don't know. I just... Well, did you... Did you trip? Is that what happened? No, no...Huh? No? I didn't trip. I just... I just fell. Oh. Easy, easy, easy...Oh, I... There's something wrong, Em. You've been falling and forgetting things. And the doctors don't seem to know what to do to help. I'm... I... I'm a little worried. I think it's time we go home. I really do. DR. HIDALGO: Is the pain constant, Mrs. Gilbert? Well, when I change positions and... Or stand up, or... Or walk. Where is the pain mostly?My back. And when did this fall take place? Yesterday. A couple of weeks ago. We saw a doctor in Spain. A couple of weeks ago. Mrs. Gilbert, how old are you? I'm... How old am I? DR. HIDALGO: She's fractured a vertebra. When osteoporosis sets into the bones, they fracture very easily. We'll put her on Percodan for the pain, to start. But... What about the other? The memory loss? It is called presenile dementia. In English. I'm sorry. Alzheimer's disease. Have you heard of this? Yeah, vaguely. Alzheimer's... Are you sure? Yes. It advances slowly, or rapidly. We have no way of knowing. Oh. What can you do about it? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing. WAITRESS: The usual, Mrs. Gilbert? EMILY: I'd like some nice hot chocolate. And her sandwich. The usual. And me, too. Okay, good. Thank you. Thank you very much. My back hurts. Ah, come on, Em. No, Ros, it hurts! Those pills are not helping me as much as they used to. How many of them I've taken in the last year! Oh, we'll get you something else. What's wrong with me? Roswell? You know something? You ought to get out and do some of the things that... Like go shopping or something. You haven't bought any new clothes in a long time. Oh, Ros, the doctors' bills... Oh, you let me worry about that. Em, uh... Skipper's coming to see us. Who?Our daughter. She's coming next week. From Baltimore.Attagirl! Yes. Oh, there's a fashion show in town, Puss. Now why don't you and Skipper go? Buy out the joint. You're always good at spending money. What do you say? Maybe I will.Good, Em. WAITRESS: Sandwiches are coming right up.Oh, thank you. Hot chocolate. I never drink that. You ordered it, Em. No! No, there is some mistake. Would you like something else? Water, please. Just plain water. This chair is very uncomfortable. All right, Puss. We'll move, we'll move. Sure. How's that one? Well, looks much better. Here you go. Better. Much better. Now, while I'm waiting for my sandwich, do you know what I'd like? A hot chocolate. A lovely hot chocolate. When someone's going to a fashion show, someone should dress as if she's going to a fashion show. Mother, there's nothing wrong with what I'm wearing. No? There usually is. Look, we haven't seen each other...Pants! ...in such a long time, let's try...To a fashion show, pants! And who dreamed up that hairstyle? Robin Hood? You should be carrying a bow and arrow, not a purse. [WOMEN CHATTERING] This is an original. Hand-beaded on silk chiffon. It's available as you see it, or it may be ordered in gold or silver. That, young lady, is God-awful. Awful! Mother! Awful!Mother! Are they allowed to display such garbage and at such ridiculous prices? It's disgusting! Disgusting! I'm not going to stay here. Disgusting! I don't know why your father insisted that I come to see this trash! She okay? Oh, sure. She's just a little tired, that's all. Taking a nap. Would you like an apple? She never asked about the children. ROSWELL: Hmm. You should've heard her, Daddy. I mean, the manager came out and asked us to leave. I think it may be a reaction to the new medication she's taking. Medication? For what? Uh... She's arthritic. I've been an engineer for 50 years. I certainly know how to slice an apple. Oh... All right, you do it. She asked me the same question ten times. And she never got off my back. I mean, I know I'm not exactly her idea of a fashion plate, but she never let up. Oh, I'll have to talk to the doctor about that medication. Is that all there is? You're not hiding anything? No, no. Say, you're gonna miss your plane. Yeah. Tell her I said goodbye.I will, I will. Sorry I don't get out here more often. But there's Clark, and the kids, and my job. How are Clark's folks? We had to put them in a home. They hate it, it's horrible. There was no other way. Bye. Bye, dear. Skipper? Yes? Don't ever do that to us. To your mother and me. No matter what happens, don't ever warehouse us. No home. Ever! KLINKER: How long will you be gone, Ros? Just overnight. I have a monthly with a consulting job with Superior Electric in Bristol, Connecticut. It's just a conference. They have some naive notion that I know what I'm talking about. So do we. Say, you think you'd like to run for the condo board? Sounds attractive.You're going away? Oh, just overnight, Em. Like last month and the month before. You...You're leaving me. Oh, Em, I told you. It's like...No! You bastard! You're going away, you're leaving me alone. You bastard! Bastard! Em, Em... You're leaving me, you bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Em, listen, Em, stop it! Oh, Puss, I'm so sorry. Oh! Did I hurt you? Yes.Oh. Forgive me. Look, let's... Let's go up to the room, shall we? Just the two of us. It'll be all right, I promise you. Shall we, hmm? Let's go up to the room. That's a girl, that's a girl. Hello, Ros.Hello, Libby. You're gonna be late for your plane. No, no, no, I'll be all right. She's never reacted this way before. I've been making this trip for months. Do you think I should cancel? Oh, no. We'll look in and so will the others. You know, I'd drop the damn thing, but that extra income kind of helps with her medical bills. Oh, of course it does. Well, you have my phone number in Connecticut? Sure.Uh-huh. Go on, don't fret, Ros. It's gonna be okay.Yeah. Don't worry. See you tomorrow, huh?Okay. Thanks, Libby. All right, have a nice trip.Thank you, Libby. Okay. EMILY: Ros? Ros? Ros? Ros? Ros? Libby? Libby? Open the door! He's in there. I know he's in there! Oh, Libby, he left me. I know he did. He left me all alone. Oh... [CRYING] Oh. Thanks, Libby. She's asleep. Thanks. Who are you and what do you want? I'm Roswell, Em. Roswell, your husband. Roswell! Oh, oh... Em...I put on fresh make-up. I wanted to look nice for you when you got home. You look fine, dear. Just fine. Here, here, here... Here.Too much? No, no, no, no, no. A little smudge, that's all. There, that's better. There. Ros?Yes? I don't want to stay here any longer. We should leave Spain. We should go back to the States. That's where we are, Puss. Where? Fort Lauderdale, Florida. We are?Yes, we are. Oh. Well, then why did you move to Connecticut? Oh, I didn't move there, Puss. I just go once a month for a day, that's all. You left me. No. Would... Would you like to go with me from now on? No. Why not? I'm afraid! Why are you afraid, Em? What is there to be afraid of? I don't know. I'm afraid, that's all. But, Puss, there's nothing to be afraid of. Ros?Yes? You won't leave me again, will you?No. Promise? Promise. Ros?Mmm-hmm? I don't want to stay here anymore. I've had enough of Spain. Haven't you? Here, Em, let me do that. There. There... I'll take a quick shower and then we'll go to the dentist, okay? What about my eyes? Oh, yeah. I'll do those later when I get dressed. You won't forget, huh? Well, I never do, do I? I don't think so. Now, you stay right there. I won't be long. MAN: Lady, what's the matter with you, you crazy or something? You're gonna get killed walking in the street like that! [HORN HONKING] Watch it, lady! You're the kind that gets other people killed! [DRIVERS SHOUTING] Yes, ma'am? Hairnets. Em? [CAR HORNS HONKING] [TIRES SQUEALING] MAN: Look out! Look out! Look out! [WOMAN SCREAMING] Oh, my God! Emily! How many times have I told you not to cross that street by yourself? I needed some hairnets. Don't you realize how dangerous that is? But I needed some hairnets! That's why I've asked you not to do that unless I'm with you. EMILY: Had to have some hairnets! Emily, you can't risk your life for a bunch of stupid hairnets! I had to have some hairnets! But, Emily... Oh... Oh. Hairnets! You haven't been flossing, Mrs. Gilbert. I'll have to do that for her. Now I wanna show you how to do this. It's different when you're flossing somebody else's teeth. Wrap that around your fist. Yeah.Around your fist. Leave enough slack. That's it. Now put it between the teeth. That's it. Now push down gently, gently. That's it. Now slowly draw the floss out from between the teeth. That's it. Draw it all the way out. Good, good, good. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] They're late again. You want me to call them?No, I'll call them. Ros? ROSWELL: Hi, Jackie. Uh, I don't think we'll be able to make it. I was gonna call you, but... JACKIE: Ros? Well, look, why don't we... No. Uh... Emily's down and... I'm sorry. [DIAL TONE DRONING] No?No. But we'll bring them some goodies in the morning. [ALL CHATTERING] JOHN: Come on, Ros. We have all sorts of leftovers for you. Gourmet delights. [RINGING DOORBELL] Ros? JACKIE: Ros? Are you okay? Can we come in? Em? Em? I'm sick. I'm very sick. Oh, come on, Emily. Snap out of it, my love. Ask him.Who? That man over there. She doesn't even know my name. Let me refrigerate these things. You just can't cope with this anymore. You've got to do something. Look, Ros, be honest, for her good as well as your own. You ought to commit her...No! Get out, Jackie!What? Go on, get out. Please! No one's gonna tell me how to handle my wife. She's my problem. Go on, get out! JACKIE: John? [DOOR CLOSING] Puss? Do you think you can get up? No. Would you try, please? I can't, Ros. The pain... You just rest, Puss. Just stay there and rest. This is a hospital. I don't wanna stay here. We just got you here for some tests. I wanna go home. We'll take you home as soon as we get the tests, okay? Oh, Nurse, could we get a roll-away in here? I'd like to spend the night with her. NURSE: Yes, sir, I'll arrange that. Now would you mind waiting outside, Mr. Gilbert? No!I'd like to get her into bed. I'll be close by.I'm going with you, I'm going home. NURSE: Oh, why...Don't you dare touch me! No! Why don't we just get your clothes off, Mrs. Gilbert? No, don't you touch me, no!Em, look... Why don't you let me try? Maybe I can get her into bed. The doctor ordered a sedative, if necessary. I'll go get it. Hi. Emily! Emily, come back!No, no! Emily, look...No, I'm going home. No, Emily, listen to me. Emily! I'm going home. If you won't take me, I'll walk home. Emily, it's five miles from here. Well, I'll take a taxi!No, you... [SCREAMS] You get away from me! You're gonna have to restrain her, Mr. Gilbert. Tell her to get away! Roswell, make them get away from me! Emily, Emily, Emily.You have to restrain her. No. No, no, no, no, no...Get away, get away! Quiet. Quiet, honey. Just quiet, just quiet... Okay... Just... Now you, you rest, Em. You just rest. You sit right here in this chair. Home, Ros. Yes.I want to go home. We will, we will, we will. There we go, there we go. Let me fix the pillow. There we go. Home...Just lean back. That's it. Ros, I want to go home. Yeah, you will, you will.Home... This... You won't let them touch me. No, I won't, Puss. She's booked for a bone scan. Forget it. You're not running a psycho ward here. We can't control her. I'm gonna have to take her home, back to square one. EMILY: Home, Ros... I am sorry, sir. EMILY: Ros. Home, home... Yeah. KLINKER: Hi, Ros.HUDAK: Hello, Roswell. Hi, Gene, John.Hi. You all right, Ros?Huh? You look a little under the weather. Me? No. Ros. Ros? Please. Ros? Ros? Where are you? Please. Ros? Ros? Please. Darling, no.Where is he? Where's Ros?Please don't be upset. No. No, you sit down here now. I'll get him.Oh... It's okay. You wait here now. I'll get him. Mr. Gilbert, sir. Please excuse me. Come out. Your wife. Em! Ros.What are you doing here? Ros, thank you.You promised to wait upstairs. Why did you come down here? I'm sick, I'm so sick. I want to die. I'm so sick.Oh, Em... [SCREAMS] You're hurting me, please. You're hurting me!I'm so sorry... Don't touch me. Please, just don't touch me, please. I want to die. Let me die. Em, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, don't say that. I want to die. Let me die.Emily, please, don't say that. [BOTH CRYING] Emily, please don't... I want to die. Please, Ros. [SOBBING] I want to die. ROSWELL: Emily, I'm so sorry. Emily. Let's... Let's go upstairs, shall we? Just the two of us. Good. Shall we?Yes. Let's... Yeah.Thank you, Ros. Thank you. There. There. This is fine, Puss. Almost there. Almost there. See? Just a little way. That's it. That's... You're doing fine, just fine. There. Yeah. I know, I know, I know... There. Sit down. Now be very, very careful, Puss. Very, very careful... Easy, easy, easy, easy. That's it, that's it, that's it. [CRYING]Oh, oh, oh... I'm sorry, darling, I'm sorry. I know how that hurts. Please, help me. Help me. Please. I love you dearly, Roswell. Help me. I love you, too, Em. Help me. I just... I just want to die. [GUN FIRING] Oh, my God. I botched it. [GUN FIRING] [OFFICERS CHATTERING] Hey, old man, what you doing here? PRISONER: What you looking at, man? You see something? [PRISONERS CHATTERING] Check it out, man. This is an old age home. Hey, Grandpa, got a smoke? PRISONER 1: Hey, give him the royal suite. PRISONER 2: Hey, Billy, is that your daddy? PRISONER 3: Hey, you want me to carry your bags for you while you check in? [PRISONERS LAUGHING] Officer, you don't happen to have a pencil, do you? Lillian? This is Roswell Gilbert. Mr. Gilbert? Oh, dear God, how are you? I'm okay, yes. Uh, Lillian, I, uh... I wonder if you'd do something for me. Whatever I can do. I wrote something down. I was wondering if if you'd copy it and put it on the bulletin board where the others could see it. Would you do that? Yes, of course. Well, here it is. "I just could not allow "my lovely lady of fifty-one years "to descend "into a living hell "of suffering and degradation." Did you get that? Yes, sir.Good. And would you put that where the others will see it? Perhaps that will help them understand. And I'm sorry I caused everyone such an inconvenience. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Sorry, that's not allowed. No touching. Sit, please. They, uh, worry about people passing drugs while they're hugging each other. You serious? They searched every private part before they let us in. Well, it's the public parts they're worried about. You're so thin, Daddy. You're so thin. How much weight have you lost? Oh, I don't know. Twenty pounds, I guess, in the last couple of months. They took my belt, my pants keep falling down. [CHUCKLES] One consolation, they can't arrest me for indecent exposure. You should've said something. We didn't know how bad it was. You should've told us. Well, what for? It was my problem. You've had your hands full with Clark's parents. That's enough for anybody to handle. Maybe we could've helped, Ros. No. My main concern is that you understand why I did this. Why I felt I had to do it. I thought at the time that maybe I ought to shoot myself. Yes, I... Get it over with. Then I thought, "I can't do that. "I've got to stand up in front of my family and my friends and explain." You see, Skipper, if you could just... Daddy, not now. We'll talk about it when you get home. Home? They've contacted an attorney. He's applied for a community release. PRISONER: Good luck, old man. [PRISONERS CHATTERING] So who'd they get, Mr. Gilbert? ROSWELL: Get?Lawyer. Oh, a man named Joe Varon. Joe Varon? Hey, that's a good name, mister. He's kept Meyer Lansky out of jail for years. Frankly, Mr. Gilbert, I don't think the grand jury will indict. We've had so many of these historic precedents. They simply refuse to indict in these cases. But in the event that they do, we've got to be prepared. I understand. You will be in community release until the grand jury meets. When will that be? Oh, in a couple of days. Meanwhile, I can start negotiating on a manslaughter charge. Maybe get probation, something. No. No? I didn't do anything wrong. Oh, but...ROSWELL: I'll go for broke. You're gonna be subjected to vigorous cross-examination if this goes to trial. I know. You're gonna win or lose this case yourself. How you explain it to the jury. I understand it. You understand it. But you might have to explain it so that the jury understands it. I had to do it. My one fear was that I would die before she did. What about your alternatives? A nursing home? Both my daughter's in-laws are in nursing homes. They're miserable. Emily could never stay anywhere without me, not for a minute. Couldn't you get someone to care for her at the apartment? She'd never have it. Anyway, it's too small. There's not much room and there was only one way out for her. For me... I'm 75 years old. I'm too damned old to be hurt much. If I had been 35 years old, it would have been an ultimate disaster. But I'm old enough so that nobody can hurt me. You aren't afraid? Frightened? Frightened? No. Not frightened. I don't frighten easily. And I didn't commit a crime in the normal sense. It was something... What? I didn't see an alternative. It was desperation, pure and simple. She was on the couch. I remember she said, "Somebody please help me." And I knew she was never going to get better. I just said, "This is the time. "I've got to do it now. I can't wait. "Not another day. I can't let her suffer like this. "Not another night." So I was cold as ice, I have to admit. And I shot her. And after I shot her... Well, I shot her twice because I... I goofed it. She... She still had a pulse. I thought, "Oh, my God, she's still living." I... So I shot her a second time. I shot her a second time. Medical Examiner, please. Dr. Ongley? This is Kelly Hancock's secretary. Fine, thanks, how are you? Good. Kelly would like to meet with you. Yes, he's prosecuting. Lunch? The body was lying face up. There was blood on the couch. Thank you. After I photographed the body, Detective Scheff asked me to come out and speak to Mr. Gilbert. Can you describe his physical condition? He appeared relatively calm. And how long did you talk to him?Five to ten minutes. You think he was in a state of insanity at the time? Personally? Mmm-hmm. No. My personal feeling is if you look at who was most inconvenienced by Mrs. Gilbert's disease, it wasn't Mrs. Gilbert. It was Mr. Gilbert. Her disease was becoming disruptive to his organized way of life. Most domestic violence scenes that are spontaneous are messy. They're not organized and thought-out events. You're really going ahead with this case? I don't think the law can discriminate because of age or sex, or because he has gray hair. We can't excuse him simply because he's 75 years old. Daddy?Hmm? What's this? What's what? This. These clothes are all soiled. Some of them are still damp. I forgot. Forgot? I was supposed to take them to the cleaners. I got side-tracked. Skip, your mother lost control of everything. I had to clean her as well as her clothes. You know how meticulous she was. Did you tell Joe Varon about this? No, she wouldn't like that, Skipper. Emily wouldn't want anyone to know any of these things about her. The least we can do is protect her memory. WOMAN: I knew her very well. I saw Emily every single day since the day she moved in. Over at the beach house since 1978. Did you notice from the beginning that she was forgetful? So she was a forgetful lady. So what? She was so beautiful. Up until the day that he did her in. This beautiful lady, all dressed, made up, clothes perfectly matched. Shoes, bag, jewelry. If she wore brown, she'd where green to go with the brown. I'd like you to testify before the grand jury. I would not like to testify against him because there will be a vendetta. I am very much afraid of what he's capable of doing. You think he could hurt somebody else. Is that what you're saying? If you hurt him... There was one man who had sand put in his gas tank because he said something that went contrary to the board of directors. And you think this was done at the instigation of the board? They're terrible. The board of directors and the managers. They're all friends. They back one another all the way. You think they'd back a man for murder? They did! SKIPPER: The pie looks fabulous. Good. You bake it? Are you kidding? Jackie brought it. Store-bought, but good. Huh. John Klinker says some of the alarms are out of commission. You'll have to take a look at them. Huh. I didn't know you installed all the systems in all the buildings. That's great. Would you like to take this in the living room? Daddy? Hmm? Oh, yes, the living room. Mmm-hmm. How about some television? Okay. WOMAN ON TV: He was talking about me? MAN ON TV: He was worried about you. About me? All that stuff you have on. Oh, that's nice of him. NEWSCASTER: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This bulletin just came in. Roswell Gilbert, the man who shot his wife in Fort Lauderdale just a few days ago, has been indicted by the grand jury. In an unprecedented move, he is being charged with murder in the first degree. [GAVEL POUNDING] Detective Scheff, did there come a time when you investigated a homicide that occurred in March 1985 that brings you here today? Yes, there was. At that time I drove over to 5100 North Ocean Boulevard, the Sea Ranch Club, Building A. And what did you observe upon entering the apartment? The first thing I noticed was the body of the victim, which was laying on the floor in the living room. After taking a quick preliminary look at the scene, I exited the apartment. I went back out to Mr. Gilbert in the hallway. I asked him if he would talk to me about the incident. He said that he would. He suggested that we use the card room down in the lobby of the building, and we rode down in the elevator along with Mr. Klinker. ROSWELL: It was my responsibility. The entire situation rested on my shoulders, you understand? I'd been considering killing her for almost a month. I'm an engineer, you know. A friend of mine gave me a hell of a bit of advice one time. Best I'd ever heard. What's that, sir? He said that if you ever have an impossible problem, the way to solve it is to smash it. Oh, Detective, I may need a toothbrush if I have to stay in jail overnight. The sheriff's office will provide you with that. They will? Yes, sir. Well, I may have to stay on probation for the rest of my life for doing this. Damico. D-A-M-I-C-O. First name is Sandy. Where do you work, ma'am?Cunningham Drugs. And how long have you worked at Cunningham Drugs? About a year and a half. Almost. Did you know an individual that became known to you as Emily Gilbert? Yes. She'd come in. Yes. Was she by herself or was she with someone? By herself. Well, just one time a man was with her. Did you know where she lived? Across the street from where Cunningham's is. Is Cunningham Drugs across A1A then? Yes. That's all I have. Thank you very much, Sandy. JUDGE: You may step down. This is a personal vendetta. Some of that testimony, Joe. "She walked across the street by herself." "She went down to the pool by herself." She was wandering aimlessly. She had no control over where she was going or knew what she was doing. And the police. "He was normal, he was lucid." How do they know what normal is? They never knew him before. How could they tell what his standard of normalcy, is? I'm afraid for him, Joe. I'm afraid for my father. He's so damned stubborn and honest and unafraid. He's gonna end up being a witness for the prosecution. He won't listen to me. And he won't show any remorse. Now Mrs. Irvin, you indicated that she was quite forgetful. And you also said that your mother had suffered... My godmother. I'm sorry. Your godmother. How many years did she suffer from Alzheimer's disease? She's been ill for four years. And where is she now? In Montreal. Montreal. Where is she living? In her home. And what is her condition? How bad is she? The last time I spoke to her, on her birthday, she said to me, "Your voice sounds familiar." She didn't know who you were? No. No one has shot her, have they? She's still alive? Yes, she is. [PEOPLE MURMURING] I've been proud of every case you've tried, Kelly. But I think it's sad that this man had lived with this lady for fifty-one years and now he has to suffer through a trial and be persecuted for this. Well, I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry you feel that way. But my responsibility is to the people, not the defendant. And I didn't indict him, the grand jury did. I'm simply here to present the facts and let the jury decide if he's guilty. How do you feel about it personally? I feel he's guilty.Why? He confessed. I mean, he admitted he was guilty. He said, right when the police officer arrived, he said he had done it. He knew it was wrong. And I don't think his solution is the best answer to problems like this. She was very ill, Kelly. What is very ill, Mother? She cared about the way she looked. She was made up, well dressed. She went to restaurants. And besides, that's the reason we have hospitals. Mister Gilbert never tried any of these alternatives, and now he wants us to believe he's a hero? This is a lady who was concerned about living, not dying. Doesn't it bother you? Doesn't it give you pain because of what you have to inflict on somebody like Roswell Gilbert? I don't think I inflict the pain. He did the act, I didn't. His decision was to kill. I think our job is not to condemn the person, but to condemn the act that he did. You don't think it was an act of mercy? No. When you talk about mercy killing, you talk about allowing people to pull the plug when they're brain-dead. I don't think anyone should play God. I don't think we can allow humans to decide who should live and who should die. We should not have the discretion to take someone's life. If we do, we no longer become a caring society. Mother, I've listened to the testimony. Roswell Gilbert didn't kill his wife to solve her problems. He did it to solve his. Oh, I feel like such a fool. No. God, I feel so awful for him. I know. Why didn't he say something? Why didn't he tell us how bad it was? Oh! Or maybe I should've called him more often. I guess I'm just going through my own little guilt trip. Oh, why didn't I go more out of my way to find out what was going on? I was so involved with my own problems at home. Too involved to think about what poor Daddy was going through down there. Oh, Clark, I should've been more aware. I shut myself off. Oh, but he was covering up for her, honey. With everybody. The lawyers wouldn't even let me testify. They said it would have been hearsay. Hearsay from his own daughter. It's because I didn't see much of them over the years. Now, be honest, honey. You and Emily never had too much in common. Oh... I never could be part of her lifestyle. And the two of them were so close, I always felt left out. So I... I guess I just sort of gave up. And now she's gone. I'm gonna have to live with that for the rest of my life. [SOBBING] Oh, God. Would you state your name and spell your last name, sir? F-R-E-D-M-A-N. Marvin Fredman. And what is your occupation, sir? I'm a psychologist. Clinical psychologist. And when did you become interested in Alzheimer's disease? In 1980 I became very involved with the Mental Health Association of Broward County. Became president at one point. I worked very closely with the Alzheimer's Association, began a support group for the relatives. What is a support group? Well, tell the jury. A support group is a recognized way of trying to help the relatives of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The support group concept is that the relatives, caretakers, so to speak, meet once a week to discuss the problems, to develop ways of coping. You indicated a term, "caretaker." FREDMAN: Yes. Over the years that you've been having contact with caretakers, can you estimate for the court how many you yourself have counseled with? Is it hundreds?Oh, I would say so. Now, do you know Roswell Gilbert? Yes. I first met Mr. Gilbert on April 5th, 1985, and had a second meeting on April 11th, 1985. I suppose I could have continued looking after her 24 hours a day. FREDMAN: But you didn't. No.There are institutions. Oh, no... It would be very difficult for anyone to handle her. They'd have to immobilize her, use constraints. I couldn't allow that. I kept hearing her pain and her suffering. She was crying out for help. So I acted accordingly. The only responsible thing I could do out of love for my wife was to end her life. I was watching her die, little by little, before my eyes. And once I made up my mind, I couldn't reverse the decision. I had to be cold as ice to carry it out. And... And... Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it! Damn it! I didn't... I didn't... I didn't want to do that. That's what everybody's waiting for once l get on that stand. They want me to cry and grovel and tell them how sorry I am. Well, I'm not going to do that. I don't want anybody's sympathy. I'm not going to go in front of that jury and break down and show remorse so that they're lenient with me. And I'm not going to use emotion to get me off the hook. FREDMAN: Mr. Gilbert, I... There's an important story to tell about my wife and her suffering and other people. And it will be told factually and with dignity. [GAVEL POUNDING] JUDGE: Mister Varon, you may call your next witness. Thank you, Your Honor. Ros, take the stand. I hope I don't break down. I hope you do. JUDGE: Please stand by this chair, raise your right hand and face the clerk and be sworn to tell the truth. CLERK: Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give in this case shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Be seated. VARON: Please state your name, sir. Roswell Ward Gilbert. G-I-L-B-E-R-T. And you're the defendant in this case, Mr. Gilbert? I am. And you're the husband of the late Emily Gilbert? I am. Now what is your age, sir? Seventy-five. And how long were you married to Emily Gilbert? Fifty-one years. And there was a time when you went to Spain in semi-retirement. They were the Golden Years, supposedly, yes. Yes. Now, in Spain, did something unusual occur to Emily that altered her, or was the start of the deterioration of her physical condition? Oh, she was walking down the steps and I heard her yell. VARON: Uh-huh.I went to her, she was on the floor. She was in terrible pain. This was the first instance of osteoporosis. When was it you made the professional acquaintance of Dr. Hidalgo? Well, we moved to Fort Lauderdale and we'd been here a few months. He took care of her, as he's testified. It became apparent that this was a lot more serious than I'd been anticipating. Mmm-hmm. Tell us about the multiple fractures. Well, most of them were... Looking at the X-rays in my mind now, the vertebrae would crush each other on one side or the other. The magnitude of it... She had been a little over five feet two. When she died, she was five feet flat. She lost two inches. A lot of people when they get osteoporosis, their spine curves. Hers never really did. It was always straight. It just collapsed. Now, in her sleeping habits, where would she sleep? Under what conditions? Well, about three and a half years ago we had twin beds in the bedroom and... But she moved to a couch in the living room which had soft bound pillows, and she slept there. When you'd gone to lunch, for example, with her, or for dinner, would she require any aids of any kind? Well, I always took a pillow in the car for her back. And during the last two or three years would you have lunch with her? Oh, yes, every day. Did you recognize, within the past year, any type of dependency? Well, yes, I could elaborate on that in great length. This damned Alzheimer's thing. It developed into inner psychotic attachment for me. She got so dependent on me that I began to think this was a mistake that we had made in our lives. You know, she should've been more independent. She developed a fright complex, and I'd say, "Emily, what the hell are you frightened about?" And she'd say, "I don't know. I'm just frightened." What about your socializing? Did you continue with that? No, not really. She liked to have people in the apartment, but I guess our casual friends would prefer not coming because she was a bit embarrassing to them. Now, was there a time when you went to Dr. Hansen's office, you were given certain instructions? Oh, yes, definitely. I flossed her teeth. Yes, almost every day. And toward the end I'd have to put her stockings on. Pick her clothes. Then she was having trouble with her underwear. She put her panties on backwards, and she was losing so much weight it didn't make much difference. She didn't put her garters on right. I had to wash her underwear, you know. These sorts of things. Now, I know this is an indelicate subject, but are you acquainted with the expression incontinence? Oh, yes. I don't think she had that. Well, that's the loss of bladder control, bowel control. Oh, once in a while. But not too often. [VARON SIGHS] All right. During all of this time can you tell this court and the jury whether you were either angered or irritated with Emily because of the so-called burdens you'd been receiving? No. Never. I loved her very much and we were two rather different people. You know, I was a professional scientist and she was a fine lady. But kind of like two adjacent pieces in the jigsaw puzzle. They don't look alike, but they sure fit together. And this is a mutual thing. No, I never felt angry with her. We would argue about how to raise a daughter or how to play bridge, but, you know, superficial things, but never in anger. And now, Ros, we come to that Monday morning, March 4th, that fatal day. Now after you took Emily to lunch, what did you do? We came back and I took Emily upstairs. But I said, "Emily, now I have to go down to a short meeting downstairs. "I'll be back in ten or fifteen minutes." She said, "All right." She heard me. And so I went down. The next thing you heard the testimony about. I took her upstairs. Sure, I know I was breaking the law. But there seems to be things more important than the law. At least to me in my private tragedy. So it's murder. So what? [CROWD MURMURING] Thank you. You may inquire. Mr. Hancock. HANCOCK: Thank you, Your Honor. If it please the court. Now, Mr. Gilbert, you're an engineer. I've been told so, yes. And you've always made decisions, isn't that a fair statement? I've had to be decisive, yes. And, in fact, you're not really an emotional person, are you? I found out recently that's not exactly so, but go ahead. Let me ask you this. You told John Klinker that you knew it was wrong and it was against the law, didn't you? Wrong or against the law? Did you tell the detectives, anyone, that you knew what you had done was against the law? Oh, against the law. Yes, I agree to that. And in fact you agree with that today. If I said it, I said it, and I meant it. Yes. Now you told the detective that you had never discussed with Emily about shooting her. Isn't that a fair statement? No, never, never. In fact, that's why you basically kind of came up from behind her. Isn't that a correct statement? Naturally. I don't want her looking down the muzzle of the gun when I do it, no. I came up alongside her, yes. But there's no question that when you went and got that gun, which is your gun, you went and got that gun, you went back there to shoot her. Isn't that correct? No question about that? Yeah. I went and loaded it. I came back and shot her. That's a fact. Right. And it's a fact that you intended to shoot her. That's a fact, isn't that correct? For a fraction of a minute, yes. Then you went back and you had to put another bullet back in the gun and then you had to go back and then you shot her again. That's right.Isn't that correct? That's right. And at that time there is no question that you intended to shoot her at that time, is there? Certainly no question. No question whatever. I shot her, yes. [PEOPLE MURMURING] Thank you, Your Honor. JUDGE: The jury has arrived at a verdict? CLERK: They have, Your Honor. Please bring in the jury. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have arrived at a verdict? Yes, sir. Please pass the verdict to the clerk. The clerk will publish the verdict. CLERK: "The State of Florida, plaintiff, versus Roswell Ward Gilbert, defendant. "Verdict. We the jury, find as follows as to the defendant in this case. "The defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree as charged "in the indictment." Oh, my God, they're killing my father! CLERK: "So say we all, signed Sylvia D. Firestone, "Foreman, date May 9, 1985." [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Let's have a little order, please. JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise? Roswell Ward Gilbert, you having been found guilty by a jury of your peers of murder in the first degree, I do hereby adjudge you to be guilty. The bailiff will take the fingerprints. Ladies and gentlemen, under the law, when a person is convicted of a felony, it's required that that individual be fingerprinted in the presence of the court and the presence of the jury. Now that is the procedure that you're witnessing at this moment. This completes your jury service. Now I'd like you to go out this way with the court deputy. Roswell Ward Gilbert, would you please approach the bench? It is the judgment of the court and the sentence of the law, that you be committed into the custody of the Director of the Division of Corrections of the State of Florida. By him, confined in an institution designed by him, for the rest of your natural life. WOMAN: Oh, no! There will be a mandatory minimum of 25 years before you'll be considered eligible for parole. I will say this to you, sir, you do have a right to appeal from this judgment and sentence. Your Honor, may I renew my motion to have him at liberty on his own recognizance. I've sentenced him. I can't release him. I will not release him. Take it easy on that old man. He's not going anywhere. Mrs. Firestone, can you tell us what the discussions were like inside the jury room? Well, nobody felt that it was a mercy killing. There was no evidence to indicate that she was terminal. My mother suffered with Alzheimer's disease and I have osteoporosis. My function has not been affected. What was the effect of his testimony on the jury? The jury felt that he was very arrogant. Had he broken down on the stand, would that have affected your decision differently? There is a remote possibility. The second shot really was the decisive factor of premeditation. Another thing the jury talked about, there are a lot of elderly people, senior citizens in Florida. You just can't give them a license to remove a husband or a wife that's in their way. You just can't do that. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] Oh, hey... Hello, Joe.Hi. Good to see you.Yeah, yeah. You care for anything? Uh, no, no, thanks. Well, how you doing? Oh, not too bad. Everybody calls me Mr. Gilbert. Tell me that I shouldn't be in here with the likes of them. That so, yeah? No, I need that. I used to think I was independent as a hog on ice, but I'm not, no. No, they've been very nice, all of them. The staff and everybody. They... Very nice. I need that. Mmm-hmm. Uh, what about the clemency hearing? Yeah, that's what I came to talk to you about. What happened? [SIGHING] No go? No go.Well, why? The governor was all for it. He needed three signatures from his cabinet. He could only get two. Two out of six? Well, it's an election year, yeah. Why don't we sit down? Huh? I really blew it on that stand, didn't I, Joe? You sure did. I blew it. Yeah, you blew it. I wanted to get up there and tell it like it was. They thought I was cold, emotionless. Hell, I was tearing up inside. Yeah. Well, it's the saddest case in my life. And unless we have a new trial, it's my last case. How come? Well, this is the case that's making old Joe retire. [LAUGHS] You serious? Oh, I'm thoroughly disenchanted with the system here. And I don't have to tell you, the law, improperly applied, can be painful. I don't need the practice. I've got plenty of money. I'm independently wealthy. But cases like yours, they can make me sick. Well, I'm sorry, Joe. I'll tell you one thing. I'd love to go to trial again. But if we do... You're gonna listen to me, you old bastard! You're gonna do it the way I tell you. I don't care whether school keeps or not. You're gonna do it my way, and you are gonna let everything out! Well, if there is a next time, I'll listen to you. You'll listen to me. But that won't change things, Joe. I still have to be honest. It's not how I say it, it's what I say, I guess. Remorse? No, I don't feel any remorse. I have none. All I have to do is sit and think about my wife, and what I did to her. And sure, I start to get teary because... I miss her. I loved her, Joe. But she was getting to be a suffering animal, crying out my name all the time. I think the law is bad. I certainly hope they legalize euthanasia. It's a right to die just as strong to me as a right to live. All I... All I have to do is ask myself, "What else could I have done?" I don't have any other answer. Do you?
