My Lady! The Crown Prince has set out for the King's palace with his sword. I fear for King's safety. If we don't stop him now, he's going to bring down the Royal Grandson with him. Madam! Namo Amitabha THE THRONE THE FIRST DAY The only reason I'm informing you of last night's events, although I'm the birth mother of the Crown Prince is to protect you, Your Majesty. My Lady, you are a faithful retainer. Truly faithful. You're the only one I can trust. Even so his illness is to blame for this disaster. If you must punish him, please show him mercy and spare the Royal Grandson, the Grand Heir. Your Majesty! I beseech you to stop. This is by the request of the Crown Prince's own mother. Why do you intend to shake the stability of this country based on words of a mere concubine? Halt! Which gate does Your Majesty wish to take? Gyeonghwa Gate. To Gyeonghwa Gate. The King summons you, Your Highness. Which gate did His Majesty use? Gyeonghwa Gate, Your Highness. Shall I take the Royal Grandson with me? You choose your son over your husband. My Lady, you are a cold, heartless woman. Take off your hat and dragon robe. Son! No, my son... You... I see you really intend to kill me already dressed for a funeral. I've been wearing them since the passing of the Queen and the Queen Dowager. Even after the three-year mourning period has long ended? Bring them out. What are all these? Did you not dig a grave in the palace garden, made caskets and have been wearing mourning clothes, to curse me to death! You've been treating me like a dead man. So I made myself a tomb. And last night...? I won't speak further of it. Repent by taking your own life. If I die, this kingdom will fall but if you die, the 300-year Yi dynasty will be saved. Is 'suicide' a punishment in the laws of this country? If I am guilty of a crime, hand me over to the court. This is a family matter, not a national affair. I am here as the head of a family, passing judgment upon a son who conspired to kill his father. If you atone by death now, you will not lose your title as Crown Prince. When did you ever regard me as Crown Prince? Or as your son? What would become of us if the Crown Prince dies? All those who served him will go down with him. Not just us but our entire clan will be wiped out. This is no time to worry about your own safety when the fate of this kingdom is at stake. Your Highness! - We beg you to stop. - Withdraw the sword. - Your Highness! - No! Mother, aren't we going to help Father? - Leave me! - We beg Your Highness to withdraw your sword. Let go of me. We beg you, sir. No, Your Highness! Your Majesty! Kill us first. Please kill us first. Your Majesty, even a king cannot impose a punishment that is not in the Great Ming Code or in any books of law. Please, sir. Remove them from my sight. Your majesty! Your Highness! Your majesty! We beg you to take heed. Please, Your Majesty! Rice chest... Bring out the rice chest. Put him inside. Don't touch me. I command you to let go. Seal it with nails. Son, no! Father, come out of there. Take the Grand Heir away. Your Majesty, please spare my Father. I beg of you. Didn't I command to let no one in? Do you want the Grand Heir locked up, too? I'll do whatever he couldn't, Your Majesty. If you want him to study, I will instead. I'll do whatever you wish. Spare my father's life. Take him away. Father, come out of there. Father! Father, come out of there. Father. Luxury... What is a luxury and what is not? This silk is a luxury. And this cotton is not. Who will you give that writing to? I shall hold it dear until the clay I die. I shall preserve it as a family treasure. Your Highness, I give you all my remaining life. Long live, Your Highness. Alright. Even the way you eat pleases me. What are you reading these days? The Book of Filial Piety, Your Majesty the Queen. What does it say about filial duties? That it represents a man carrying his old parent on his back, Mother. Who will you carry on your back? My precious baby! It is time for your studies, Your Highness. Oh, my head hurts! Go on, my dear. “He who loves his parents does no evil unto others.” “He who loves his parents does no evil unto others...” “He who respects his parents dare not be arrogant.” Your Highness, how can you be dozing off? If you understood the true meaning of filial piety, you could not be falling asleep. You will be tested by the King in two days. Please take heed. Your filial duty as the prince is to study. Can I sleep with mama? A Crown Prince must sleep on his own. Can't he stay with me, just tonight? It's against court rules. His Highness is not your son, but the Queen's now. Your Majesty, it is past your bedtime. As a father transcribing a book for his son, how could I go to sleep? THE SECOND DAY As Your Majesty commanded, we've captured all those involved with the Crown Prince in his misconducts. Royal Secretary, issue a decree that demotes Crown Prince to a commoner. I'm a servant to this kingdom. Please give me a justification to honor your wishes. Is that right? Then, Chief Secretary, you write it. I can't do it either, Sire. How embarrassing for the King. Bring out the ink and paper. Can't he sentence the Prince to drink poison? If he bestows poison, it makes the Crown Prince a traitor. If the Prince be a traitor, his father is also a traitor. That is the law of this country which follows the laws of Ming China. The Crown Prince was born with many fine talents. He brought me great joy and I loved him deeply. But since the age often, he began to neglect his studies and after assuming the regency, developed a serious illness that turned him into an obscene and wicked character. When the illness deteriorated he lost his reason and even murdered a eunuch. He associated with shamans, Buddhist nuns and courtesans day and night, and abandoned his duties to the King. Moreover, he built a tomb in the palace garden, and conspired to carry out an unspeakable act. Hence, Consort Yi, the birth mother of the Crown Prince informed me that my life is at stake and requested to make a decision. Thereupon, I depose the Crown Prince and order that he be locked up as a commoner. I am blessed with such a beautiful daughter-in-law! Since I received your formal greetings today, I shall give a word of advice. Serve your husband with utmost devotion. Never let your voice or your face be frivolous. Whatever happens in court shall be deemed normal. So do not show any signs of acknowledgement. A wife shall not greet her husband in undergarments. Always maintain the proper attire in front of the Crown Prince. However pretty your make-up is, lipstick mark on your husband's attire is not pretty. Take care not to... Why do you laugh? How dare you! How can a princess born from a concubine sit alongside the future queen? Behave with due courtesy. There're things you must remember when serving the King. I'm the Queen only by title. Lady Yi should tell her as one who served the King closer. His Majesty takes care to avoid using certain words. He shuns ominous characters such as 'death' so, never uses them. After finishing his royal duties for the day... he always gets changed before entering his chamber. If he has heard ominous words, he rinses out his mouth and washes his ears before bed. Then, he summons someone he disfavors and says a word to him, Everything well? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Leave me now. As to get rid of bad luck. He uses different gates for pleasant and unpleasant matters. For pleasant, he takes Manan Gate, but for the unpleasant, he takes the Gyeonghwa Gate. Also, he never lets those he loves be in the same place as those he disfavors. As such, the King is unfathomably blatant in how he expresses his love and resentment. You, Crown Princess shall tread carefully to avoid falling out of favor. So whimsical... Your Highness, take heed not to upset the elders of the royal court. Always tread carefully then, even more carefully. Father, Mother... Your Highness, don't cry on such a joyous day. Let her cry. Grow, Magical Staff! People envy us for becoming the King's in-laws but we should be on guard to protect our clan. Your Highness. Qing Emperor has sent this puppy as your wedding gift. What is your name? Do you know how great Father is? He surpasses any courtiers even in studies. Do not fear him though. You have me to rely on. You have passed Father's test. I can guarantee. Yes, my Lord. Keep still, Mong. My Lady, can you hold him still? I am blessed with such a beautiful wife! Always serve your husband with a smile. It's time to study, Your Highness. “The path cannot be diverted at any time.“ “If it can be diverted, it is not the path.“ “Nothing is more visible than the hidden and nothing is more apparent than the subtle.“ “Therefore, a man of integrity is cautious even more when alone.“ Pass. Pass? Did you say pass? “A man of integrity is cautious even at a place where he is not seen, and is apprehensive even where he is not heard.“ He skipped a whole phrase, not a word. Yet, you say pass? He is the future King and the root of the kingdom. How can you act this way unless you wish to ruin this country? This is a book I stayed up all night to transcribe for your studies. If you can't even memorize this, what could you possibly learn? How many times in a year do you think about studying? Once or twice, Sire. What? Sir, how can you specifically say once or twice? Your Highness is too modest. Teacher, I know my own heart. Is that so? Good for being so honest! When I was your age, I was afraid that something may hinder my studies. But you, in this fortunate condition, neglect your studies. The Crown Prince is not very fond of strict books of codes, - but novels like 'Journey to the West'... - What? You're letting the Crown Prince read such rubbish? Your Majesty, I beg you to watch him with patience and affection for he has excellent disposition... How can you say that looking at his tanned face from playing outside all day! Playing is a pleasure of a moment, but learning offers a pleasure of a lifetime. You have nothing to say but to stare at me? THE THIRD DAY Open up! Open this gate at once! Open it. Open the gate. Open the gate. Open the gate. Open it. Open it. Open the gate. Open it. Open. Your Highness. You can't do this. I'd rather take the poison! Your Highness! - Sir! - Please! This could get the Royal Grandson killed. Let him murder his own son. His grandson, too! Let him kill everyone! Your Highness... Your Highness... Kill us all! Let him reign for thousands of years all by himself. Lock him up again. Let go of me. Why is it all my fault? Think about what you did to me. You have no right to say that. If you're so blameless... Then, kill me now! Shut the lid. This is not the conduct of a king. This is not the conduct of a king! Your Highness, you must think of the future. Bind the chest. Put moss over it. In regular homes, parents raise their children with love. But in the royal household, they regard their children as enemies. Why do you think that is? How can a father's love for his child be different? It is different. Every time I visit the Shrines, I hear the bloody cries of my forefathers. This here is the shrine of my father, Sukjong the Great who reigned for 46 years. This king bestowed poison upon his wife. And this is the shrine of my older brother, Gyeongjong the Great. People say that I killed him to steal the throne. What do you think? I'm sure it's nothing more than a malicious rumor created by your opposition. Pay no heed, Sire. There are kings who have killed their own brothers and nephews to preserve the dynasty. To regard children as enemies in a royal household... Can you understand now? You will when you become King. No, Your Majesty! How can you command us something we cannot accept? I have waited 25 years for this day. Now that Crown Prince has come of age, it's time for me to hand over the throne. Stop the King at once. He is not speaking from his heart again. The Crown Prince still has more to learn. Why do you interrupt his studies by giving him duties as king? I never cared for the throne. As you all know, I only held the position temporarily since my brother had no heir. Indeed, we know Your Majesty's genuine intentions. Let us assist you with even greater effort. Your Majesty, please revoke your royal decree. We beg of you, Your Majesty! If so, what if I make the Crown Prince regent? Is that also unacceptable? Creation of the Hangul alphabet and expansion of northern territories are known feats of Sejong the Great. But these were achieved during his son Munjong's regency. That is why they say that regency ruling has no real reward. My Teachers, the regency is for Father, not me. You need not worry. Do this right. People always judge the father with his son's work. If we reduce the military tax from two rolls of textile to one, as Your Highness commands, the defense budget will be short by 800,000 nyang. What is your solution, Defense Minister? If we have each province contribute 120,000 nyang from their reserve funds and impose penalty on those avoiding military duties for additional 50,000 nyang, 170,000 nyang in total can be collected. And for the remaining 630,000 nyang? From 800,000 tracts of land owned by the nobles, we can impose a land tax of 1 nyang for every 2 tracts... Your Highness! By law, the nobles are exempt from military duty. You always claim that this is a land of noblemen. Yet, you leave the duty of defense to starving commoners? The royal household shall set an example by paying 100,000 nyang as tax from its fisheries, salt ponds and ships. The remaining 130,000 nyang shall be saved by uniting five armies for efficiency. - What do you think? - Your Highness... You cannot interfere with the military control. Why is that? His Majesty the King gave us a pledge when he ascended the throne. So their faction took the advantage and had complete control of the military for past 25 years. - Corruption getting beyond control. - How dare you! Enough! Your Highness, the indictment of a faction monopolizing military control must be uprooted. How can segregation be tolerated even within the military? Your Highness, it is not segregation. He's talking about mere social groups. Is Joseon's army a place for your socializing? How can there be segregation in King's royal army? As of today, all factional segregation in all five armies shall be abolished and reformed. I order you to unify the command system into one between His Majesty and armies. A fair and square decision, Sire. A fair and square decision, Sire. Those who have relished control of the military as a reward for having helped the King seize the throne, finally met their match. You must be so proud of your husband. For appearance or character, our Crown Prince surpasses the King. We've been expecting, so we can accept military taxes. - However... - I hear you. Military control is a matter of loyalty between us, Sire. Enough! Mind your attire. Not quite like the way you handled state affairs. Tie your hem again. Did you have fun making your whimsical decisions? That is your problem. Why divide the court into your side and mine? As your son, I wanted to restore military control back into your hands... You think I left things as they are because I'm ignorant? My policy of 'Magnificent Harmony'... You rendered my life's work worthless in just one day. The throne is not a place for making decisions. It's a place to moderate decisions and ask who's responsible. This is a petition by the Governor of Hamgyeong. For relocation of the defense camp in Seogjin back to Gilju. Gilju can block all nine routes leading to six fortresses whereas Seongjin can block only three routes. If we move the defense camp back to Gilju, how can we defend Seongjin? We can leave a reserve of soldiers. Then, it would be advisable to move the camp back to Gilju. Ministry of Military, discuss details and execute. - As Your Highness commands. - Wait, wait. My decision to move the defense camp to Seongjin was made for a reason. If you overturn that decision, where does that leave me? You all trying to undermine me behind the Prince regent? Huh? What do you know about national defense? Ever been to the northern state? Leave the defense camp as it is and consult with me first on all major decisions from now. Next. Your Highness, Ministry of Defense borrowed silver from the central army, while central army is due to pay us 300 bags of rice as tax. But central army is refusing to pay in exchange of the silver we must repay. Your Highness, the Defense Minister's claim is one-sided. He's not returning the silver we had for emergencies yet, demands the rice as tax. That is totally absurd. How dare can they call it even with the temporary loan of silver we used for the Qing's envoy and the tax to our country? Your Highness, please settle this matter. What... should I do, Sire? You trouble me over such trivial matter? Making you regent was futile. Order the central army to send the rice, and the Defense Ministry to repay the silver. What else? As His Majesty commands. Next. A petition from the Governor of the southern state, Your Highness. They haven't had any rain in four months so their crops are all ruined. Your Highness, what should we do? The heavens didn't give rain due to my lack of virtue as King. Why ask the Prince? That is not true. It hasn't rained since I assumed regency. It's all due to my lack of virtue as the Crown Prince! Your Highness, let's go to the interrogation hall where His Majesty presides. You must attend the interrogation. My Lord, is this how regency ruling is? You must endure it, Your Highness. I don't want to. Your Highness... Is the policy of Magnificent Harmony all about being conscious of high officials? How can I serve a King who murdered his own brother? Still babbling about that? The rumor was judged groundless when I ascended the throne. If that is true, why did Yi In-jwa rise in revolt? Isn't it because he couldn't acknowledge you as King? Rip out his mouth! Killing one man will not change the way of this world. How can a son of a lowly court slave succeed Sukjong the Great? It's not just people from Naju who think this but everyone in the south does. Rip out his mouth, too. You may be the king of dogs in Qing China. But this is Joseon. If you keep barking, I will mate you with a mutt. Your Highness, the King seeks you. Such abominable bastards! I have heard more horrendous curses than I can bear. - Is everything well? - Yes, Your Majesty. Why didn't you come to the interrogation? Did you study? When your father works so hard day and night... And you call yourself my son. Get out. Yes, Sire. You... Did you write a poem to Yi Eui-gyeong for his journey that says that reading is your greatest pleasure? Yes, Your Majesty. How can reading be your greatest pleasure? Not only did you deceive him, but you deceived everyone in that region who will read your poem and praise you. It's because of your lies that this rain they need in their drought-ridden region is pouring down here on our sacred visit to the royal tomb! Don't you ever pretend to be honest. You're unworthy of paying respects to my father's tomb. Return to the palace! If only I had another son... Move it! THE FOURTH DAY Water... Bring water. Bring water. Water! Bring me water at once! The moss is dry. Water it! Your Highness! You must breathe out slowly. It's a boy! I saw a blue dragon in my dream last night. We're going to have a Royal Grandson! Thank you, my dear. I can finally face the ancestors at the Royal Shrine. Your Highness, let me have a fan made from this painting and offer it to the Grand Heir on the day he ascends the throne. Congratulations, madam! You're going to have an audience with your grandfather. You mustn't cry, my dear. The Grand Heir is here to pay his respects to the King. Not now. Take him away. The Queen's 60th birthday is in two days. But we haven't been able to prepare without your word, Your Majesty. Lady Yi, when the King doesn't issue a decree, there must be a reason, right? What should I do? His Majesty is swamped with duties. We, concubines, shouldn't trouble him further. How dare you...! I won't hear any more of it. Leave! All of you! You dare disrespect the Crown Prince's birth mother, only because the King favors you? Strike her harder. Give it here! You spiteful wench! I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget. What do you think you're doing? Leave us! However little your affection for the Queen is, you're yet to issue a decree for her 60th birthday. Is that your intention or that of your new consort? Isn't it thoughtful of the Crown Prince's birth mother in wishing to celebrate the Queen's birthday? And yet, the new consort was disrespectful to her, instead of learning from her. So, I am showing discipline among the royal consorts. If you act this way, I cannot be King anymore. What did you say? Are you siding with that lowly thing because she has conceived your seed? Lowly thing? You call her lowly? You're the one who made me, a low-born, king. Why don't you take away my throne, too? I shall abdicate my throne. Grant your royal permission! Fine. Suit yourself. I give you my royal permission. No, Your Majesty! We beg you to rescind the decree. Your Majesty! I beseech you to revoke. It cannot be accepted. Your Majesty! Please rescind the royal decree to turning over your throne. How many times did I tell you that I don't care for the throne? I already obtained permission from the Queen Dowager. Let's go. Your Highness, the King has left the palace. Let's get up now. Please go back, Mother. Your Majesty the Queen Dowager, will you allow the unthinkable to happen to the Crown Prince? Please revoke your royal permission. I shall teach the King a lesson so he won't distress the poor Crown Prince again with insincere threats of abdication. But till now, you are the one who's been protecting the Crown Prince. You're the only one in court, who can save him now. Though I may be a frail woman, I'm the Queen Dowager of this country. How can I revoke the words that I've already spoken? However, Your Majesty, if you delay the Crown Prince dies. Please save him, madam! If that is the case, it will all end when I die. From this day forward, do not bring me food. Your majesty! Tell the King that my aging ears misheard him and mistakenly issued the permission. Your Highness, the Queen Dowager revoked her royal permission. Please rise. Your Highness. Your Highness. Your...! If you had stayed put, you'd have become King in time. Why did you have to make her revoke her permission, and drove her to her death? I am to blame for her death. You despicable serpent! Do you think I don't know how you really feel? Yes! It is all is my fault. The soul that left us today If you may visit us enjoy this good food and drink from this cup May you pass unto your descendants the good fortune unspent in your life Following the words of this mantra please rid of grudges and all hard feelings but encourage kindness and unload all worries May only luck remain May you enter nirvana and reincarnate as a man Namo Amitabha By the Seven Stars and the Supreme God... That's enough. His Highness doesn't have the constitution for alcohol. Fill the cup. I fear for your health, Sire. Does this look like wine to you? These are the bloody tears of my grandmother whom I got killed. Your Highness, the King asks for you at the Palace Academy. You've been neglecting your duties as regent, using the passing of the Queen and Queen Dowager as excuses. So, I came here to greet you. I see you have abandoned your studies. Look at the state of your attire. Where is your hat? And your coat tie is all loose. You... Have you been drinking? I have, Sire. A Crown Prince, drunk during the period of mourning... Don't you know an army commander was beheaded last month for violating alcohol prohibition? Majesty, His Highness doesn't have the constitution for alcohol. You Majesty should smell his breath for wine. I just told the King that I drank. How dare you say otherwise? Leave us. One should not scold even a dog in front of an elder. How dare you scold a court matron in front of me? I did so as she dared to make an excuse. Bring water so I can cleanse my ears. I am at fault for appointing a useless wretch like you as the Crown Prince. A mere woman risks her life to defend me. Yet none of you spoke a word! THE FIFTH DAY Mong? Is that you? Does the Royal Grandson feed you well? And Crown Princess brushes you? Why didn't you bark last night? Are you frightened of the King, too? Shouldn't we seek a way to protect the Royal Grandson? My intention was to save both the King and the Crown Prince. Let me take care of my nephew the Grand Heir. I beg your pardon? Who in here other than myself can make him King? You must entrust me with your son. Father listens to me. Absurd. Surely, you cannot bet the life of this family on words of a low rank princess. Since the new Queen is installed, the King's health has improved. This is without a doubt... What are you doing here? I must seek ways to save myself and my family. Should the Grand Heir become King, it'll be the end for all who didn't stop his father's death. What do you suggest? We must do everything to prevent the Grand Heir from ascending the throne. Then what? If the new Queen bears a son, that will put an end to the matter. And even if that fails, we could put a dumb royalty on the throne and have the Queen rule as regent behind the veil. Indeed, it was our fathers who drank poison to save the King when he faced charges of treason. Father, Brother... I'm terrified of the King. What is greater than a mountain and deeper than an ocean? It's the love of a parent. What do you think? It's the King's benevolence. It's a man's heart. A man's heart? Why is that? I learned that a man's spirit is higher than a mountain and a woman's fidelity is deeper than an ocean. Sorry I... If there's anything I can do for you, tell me. I beg Your Majesty not to promote the men in my family. I am blessed with a wife of great wisdom. I'm not asking him to do daily greetings. It's been over a month since his new mother, the Queen is here. And the Crown Prince doesn't pay his respects? Due to his illness, he has not been out for some time now. Have him visit me when he gets better. Yes, Your Majesty. What nonsense! Is he in his death bed? Died in vain is this young soul Your Highness... Open it. White Guardian of the West Black Guardian of the North Yellow Guardian of the Center Where is the Crown Prince? My dear mother... How have you come to this, having to serve a young Queen? My Lord, you must stop this. And pay your respects to the new Queen. I don't even visit my own mother. Why would I bother visiting her? What would the Grand Heir learn from your behavior? Grand Heir! Grand Heir! Is he all you care about? I don't exist in your eyes, do I? My Prince, I beg you to reconsider for my sake. Oh my poor mother. Is the old fart mistreating you since he has a new young wife? Please! I know, I know... I'll stop by tomorrow morning to show my face. So, don't you worry. It doesn't fit! - Bring me another robe. - Yes, Your Highness. Here is a new one. It's a brand new robe completed this morning. Your Highness must hurry. The Queen hasn't had her breakfast to wait for your greeting. This is not right. It's all wrong! Your Highness. Sir... Bring out another. A new robe! Right now! Please calm down, Sir. Bring out a robe! There are no more, your Highness. Get me another! I beg you to take heed. There are no more robes. Your Highness! What's delaying him? I cannot tell whether she is thoughtful or just dumb. You mustn't speak of the Queen that way. I wonder how she bewitched the Father so completely. I heard they only hold hands in bed. Everyone that the old fart favors are here. I cannot spend another day in the same palace as him. Have the old man move to Gyeonghui Palace. Or we shall all die together! I hear you, brother. I'll do all I can to make that happen. I will... I guarantee you, brother. THE SIXTH DAY Stop shaking, you wretches. I'll die from dizziness. He's still alive. You cannot be here, Your Highness. Step aside! I'm afraid I can't, sir. It's the royal command. What is your name and rank? Head of the King's guards, Kim Do-su, Sir. I shall remember your name. Step aside. Father, your daughter-in-law brought you water. Father, your daughter-in-law brought you water. Father, your daughter-in-law brought you water. Come out of there, Father. Come out of there, Father. Father, your daughter-in-law brought you water. Father, come out of there. Please come out. Your daughter-in-law brought you water. Your daughter-in-law brought you water. Father! Didn't I order to let no one in? Can't a son offer water to his own father? The Grand Heir is to stay with his mother's family until further command. Does a king need many vassals to be a good ruler? Even with few vassals, one can be a good ruler if he is a loyal king. Will it be easy to bring in wise men? If the king sets good examples, it will be easy. A child barely 10 years old has such a deep insight! Then, can one match the heavenly high virtues of kings Yaw and Sun? Even though unattainably high, one can match that by endeavoring day and night.. Pass. He has passed. It's a pass! Lineage of our dynasty depends only on the Grand Heir. How can a son like this come from a father like him? 'Like father like son' doesn't apply to my family. Who is Sukjong the Great who rests here? He is my great-grandfather and a king who reigned for the longest period of 46 years in Joseon's history. You must reign for even longer, Grandfather. WW do you say that? Because that is the filial duty in royal household. What does it mean to be King? And to be a subject? I have sat on this throne for 37 years. I'm no longer sure what it means to be King. The king doesn't always get to hold the sword handle, and a servant doesn't always hold the blade. Study hard. If you're not a learned king, you can't hold the sword handle. I will take that to my heart. Son, I heard you visited Sukjong's tomb with your grandfather. Yes, Father. Do you really enjoy studying that much? Yes, Father. Why do you enjoy it? Because it makes Grandfather happy. Is that right? I hate myself for that. How dignified is that arrow that flies freely through the air! I could not attend your royal wedding because the King didn't allow it. I'm sorry for that. My dear daughter-in-law. Man and wife must always cover each other's mistakes. And not subject themselves to trivial rules of etiquette, but love each other dearly, and more dearly for eternity. I'll take that to my heart. I wish to turn over the throne to the Grand Heir. Who among you will submit a petition to depose the Crown Prince? I'm afraid I cannot obey that command, Sire. Even after witnessing all the misconducts of the Prince? I was even forced to move out to this palace. Huh? As his teachers, you are responsible for what he has become. Write the petition as I instructed. It is a royal command. Finally, what we feared has happened. This was why the King promoted us to ministers. Your Majesty, your joy and your wrath change so whimsically that it is difficult to discern your true intentions. I beseech you on my knees to suppress your anger and to show benevolence to the Crown Prince, so that harmony can be restored in this dynasty. Your Highness, please go to Gyeonghui Palace and reconcile with the King. If you don't, all your vassals will be put to death. When did I have any vassals? Power cannot be shared even between father and son. Just a few more years, and you'll sit on the throne. Is it that hard to visit the King now and then and pretending to study? I don't want to live like that. I can't live like that. I shall live by my own ways. Take a seat, mother. Make yourself comfortable. My dear mother, please forgive your son for delaying 6 years in celebrating your 60th birthday. Please forgive me. May you be blessed with long life and good health. Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise. The Grand Heir shall bow 4 times. But it is against the decorum. Wearing a queen's ceremonial robe alone can cause trouble. If the King hears that we bowed 4 times... Who is the head of this family? At least for today, let my mother be the Queen. Finish your bows. Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise. Everyone shall bow 4 times! Bow. Rise. Bow. Stand back! It's the Queen's royal progress! Stand back! It's the Queen's royal progress! Stand back! It's my mother, the Queen's progress! It's my mother, the Queen's progress! Stand back. Stand back. Stand back. Since vice-premier died to act against the Crown Prince's deposition, Ministers Min and Yi have also committed suicide. Those weak-hearted souls only speak of reforms and cause. They run away when they're scared to face the real world. The King's troubles are deep. We could help him. Why would he have any feelings left for the Crown Prince who doesn't even come to see him. If only the King's mind is set... This could end in your death. I am prepared, my Lord. Know that your family will be taken care of. The Crown Prince associated himself with Buddhist nuns and courtesans. He killed a eunuch and conspired to kill the King by storing weapons in a cave behind the palace garden. I can't read any more. Burn it. But Your Majesty, it's an important evidence. Your Majesty, I find it hard to believe that someone of his lowly status can dare to report on the Crown Prince. I beg you to investigate who is behind him. How can you know about affairs within the court walls? The eunuch who was murdered by the Crown Prince was my brother. We must find out who's behind. We beg of you, Your Majesty! Your Highness, you can't be here. Sire! Allow me to confront him. Accusation of treason is preposterous! How dare you try to frame me? Who put you up to this? My brother who you brutally killed! You are more than capable of high treason. Your majesty! I lied about treason to have an audience with you, Your Majesty, to plead injustice. But everything about the Prince's misconduct is true to the letter. Your Majesty, falsely accusing the Crown Prince of treason is a serious crime that shouldn't be taken lightly. You abominable wretches! Even a lowly man like him acts out of concern for this country and bravely reports the Crown Prince's faults. You who receive stipend didn't bother to report on him? How can this country not be ruined? Please allow the Crown Prince to confront the man and discover who is behind this. Please, Your Majesty. Your Majesty, even if you take our disloyalty and his unfortunate circumstances into account, his crime of deceiving the King must be punished by the most severe sentence. No, Your Majesty. You mustn't execute him yet. I appreciate your loyalty and I sympathize with your circumstances. Because of you, I have learned of the Prince's misconducts. However, falsely accusing treason is a great offense. I command you to behead him. Your majesty! Before you execute him, please find out who's behind him. Please reveal the truth, Sire! Do you really wish to make your son a traitor? Your existence in itself is treason. How dare you wield your sword at your wife and sister? What are you, a butcher? This is all because of my pent-up anger. Pent-up anger? Why don't you just go mad? I don't want to see your face. Go to Geumcheon Bridge and beg for punishment. The soul that left us today If you may visit us Enjoy this good food And drink from this cup May you pass unto the good fortune unspent in your life Following the words of this mantra please rid of grudges and all hard feelings but encourage kindness and unload all worries May only luck remain May you enter nirvana and reincarnate as a man What's the matter? The Crown Prince headed out to the King's palace with his sword. My Lord! Step aside. Please stop, my Lord. No, not this! He says my existence in itself is treason. I will show him. Get out of my way. - Please stop. - Out! My Lord! My Lord! My Lady! My Lady! The Crown Prince has set out for the King's palace with his sword. I fear for King's safety. If we don't stop him now, he's going to bring down the Royal Grandson with him. My Lady! That's my grandson. I hear that your father threw a banquet for your grandmother's 60th birthday? That's true, Grandfather. I heard you bowed 4 times, too. That is also true, Grandfather. Your real grandmother is but a mere concubine. Why did you bow 4 times like you would to king or queen? Isn't that against the decorum? Answer me. I can bow before you a hundred, a thousand times even if you weren't King. Why is that? Because men come before all laws and decorum. Not the other way round. Confucius also said not to see the trivia of decorum but to see the heart. That day, I saw my father's heart. When your older brother died and I begot you at the age of forty. THE SEVENTH DAY I was so overjoyed that I invested you the Crown Prince as a baby and started educating you as King from the age of 2. I could never forget the brightness and wisdom you showed in those days. But then... you started playing with swords, painting pictures of dogs, and neglected your studies. And I felt as though the heaven collapsed from top of me. Is that why you had me sit in front of your vassals and made an imbecile out of me? I did so out of desire to make you a good king. Do you know how anxious I got every time you made a mistake? How is that my fault? It was because you gave the sword handle to your vassals when you became King. Don't you know the fate of a prince who doesn't seize the throne? If I didn't become the King with their help, I would've long been killed. You wouldn't exist, if I died back then. Because I know that, I tried so hard to understand you. But... the way you treated me smothered me. I couldn't endure it. Is learning so important? Is one's attire so important? Your subjects will look down on you for your lack of learning or for a crooked trouser tie. In this country, learning is the country's prime value. The decorum is the prime value. Do you know why I didn't kill you that night? Because men come before all laws and decorum. How can learning or decorum be the prime value if it oppresses men? I don't want to be king, I don't want power. All I wanted was one loving gaze and... one warm word from my father. How is it that you and I could only have this conversation at the crossroads of life and death? I shall be... recorded as a father who killed his own son. You... won't be recorded as a traitor who conspired to kill King but as a lunatic who tried to kill his own father. That's the only way... that your son can be saved. If I weren't a King and if you weren't the King's son, how could this have happened? This is our fate. You... my silly boy. Why did you have to make your old father commit this atrocity? How could a mother who drove her son to death expect to live? Even the grass won't grow on my tomb. Oh my baby. My Lady... Madam! How can you be at fault? My son... It wasn't me that got him killed. It wasn't my fault, was it? It wasn't my fault. Tell me it wasn't my fault... My baby... my son... Head back to the palace. Play the song of triumph. How relentless... A triumphal music after putting his own son to death. THE EIGHTH DAY 1,000 bags of rice! 2,000 bags! 3,000 bags! In considering the Royal Grandson's heart, and remonstration of my vassals, I reinstate the Crown Prince's title and grant him the posthumous name 'Sa-Do'. Sa as in 'to think' and Do as in 'to mourn.' Come with me. Now! He is not Prince Sado's son any more. We must send him off to the King at once. Take off your mourning clothes. No, Mother. I don't want to. You must take it off and leave now. No. No. No, Mother. You must accede to the throne if you wish to avenge your father's death. 14 YEARS LATER The reason I abolish your father's record is for your kingship, and this country's future. Whoever tries to elevate your late father's title to a king will be deemed traitor to the dynasty. This is a matter of loyalty to the throne. I will take that to my heart. From this moment, never speak of the matters concerning your father. Agony is one thing, loyalty is another. Return my King! Return my King! Return my King! The spirit of Joseon's King, please come back to the palace. Long live our King! Long live our King! Long live our King! Father, your daughter-in-law brought you water. Father, your daughter-in-law brought you water. Come out, Father. Your daughter-in-law brought you water. Father, drink this water. Forgive your heartless wife. I came before you, my husband, now that I turned 60 and streaked with gray hair. Father, I am to blame for your death. If I wasn't born, it all wouldn't have happened. Look at the commanding stature of your son. Please stretch your legs and rest in peace. Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise. I wish to share with you this joy of celebrating the 60th birthday of my mother and late father. I witnessed so many horrible events as a child, I never had the chance to make my mother laugh. So, today, I will make up for it all.
