WILL OUR HEROES SUCCEED IN FINDING THEIR FRIEND WHO HAS MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED IN AFRICA? Tulio! What's going on? Are we stuck? It's 13:15. Wake up! Notes to Silvana. 08:30 - Set up meeting with Santucci, to discuss Deep Sea Fishing from A to Z. Soft, laminated cover. Perfect for beach reading. 09:30: Appointment with Bossi. Why must I meet him? - What's this? - For the STP Magazines contract. Why give it to me then?! I've already told you! 10:30 - Set up a meeting with Lombardozzi to discuss the project Literary Ace. Thus we'll prove our publications also have a cultural agenda! Clearance prices: 300 lira per Balzac. 11:00 - Titles team in my office. The titles for the Football Encyclopedia are juvenile and outdated. Let's be punchy. Let's think clearly! Let's go, let's do it! According to the Italian consul in Luanda, your brother-in-law, ORESTE Sabatini, arrived in Portuguese Africa in September 1965. As of May 1966, his wife has not heard from him. What's your opinion, Colonel? Is he dead or disappeared? Please don't interrupt. I'm getting to the facts. Sabatini is then spotted in the extreme South of Angola, at Nemakonde, in Bushmen territory. Those are the tiny ones? No, very tall. They're ancestors to the Watussis. The famous Bushmen, the men of the scrubland. The claim that he might have died near the Duque of Bragança Falls is completely unfounded. In fact, in March '67, an ivory trader sees him on a river boat heading towards Tombwe, the last supplying point on the Cunene River, a river full of hippopotamuses and rich in gold deposits. Paradise. Purgatory. Purgatory... Hell. Devil. Horns. Bull. Cow. Milk. Mozzarella. Mozzarella. Hippopotamus. Fausto! Hippopotamus? What's the connection? What analogy is there between mozzarella and hippopotamus? Why? Can't you make mozzarella with hippopotamus milk? - Quelle horreur! - Quelle horreur? This is my house. I can do and say what I want. Qui n'est pas d'accord se ne peut aller! Ça va bien? Forgive him. He works too hard. He really needs some rest. Shall we continue from mozzarella? One, two... Mozzarella. Cheese maker. Note: Transfer the Sex and Eroticism pamphlets from the Science section to the children's collection. 18:00: Frattina bookstore to introduce the Leisure and Pastime collection. Tell Galeazzi to write my improvised speech. Make an appointment with Mr. Guizzi. End. Accountant, go deliver the tape to Silvana. Book my flight to Milan and come back here with the thing. What thing, boss? The thing... What's it called? - The car? - Of course! What else? Why am I seeing Guizzi? Let's hope that he knows. Mario! Mozzarella and tomato juice. In 15 minutes. Yes, sir. - Hi, Di Salvio. - Hi, how are you? Great, like a lion! I only have 10 minutes. At 15:00, I have an appointment with Tanzinger. You hooked him? Fausto! I managed to lower my handicap from 9 to 7. Bravo! In Tombwe, the faint tracks of ORESTE Sabatini are apparently engulfed by the impressive Duque of Bragança Falls. In order to pick up his brother - in - law's fresh tracks, someone must be sent on site. Hi, dad. I'm going out. Makes sense. It's midnight. - Hi, John. - Good evening, sir. Your sister-in-law is here. Good evening. Look who's here. Marisa! It's about time you got home. Marisa, stop drinking, I beg you.. Since they lost track of my husband in Tombwe... Since they lost track of him, he's being written off? What do we do? Do I wear black? Marisa, it's an obsession. Do you want him to be dead? We'll send someone on site. We'll spend a bit more. Yes, yes. We should have never let him go there. Never. Who are you blaming? He's the one who wanted to go. - It's your fault. - Here we go. He was suffocating in this city. You made Rome unlivable. You made him run away. Bunch of cowards! He chose the real jungle. Here, he doubted himself. He felt frustrated, under-appreciated. - Enough. - He wasn't like Fausto. Why? How am I? You're different. You're in your house, with your wife, your son. You're rich, happy. You've made it. Whereas poor Titino... Your sister said: "Poor Titino"... Did I hear that right? "Poor Titino," she said. And I broke a bottle. Yes, yes! Goddamn bitch of a life! Those gone are not to be pitied. Those who remained here, in front of you are! With glass shards in my hand. - Have you hurt yourself? Show me. - Yes! No! Yes, I cut myself, but I'm not showing you. We're dying here! I am a lion. Even the lions are dying here! They feel sorry for Titino. He has known the silence of the great rivers. But I only know the grating of your irritating voices. Horns, milk, cow, mozzarella... I'm fed up with mozzarella! And fed up with you too, Alright? Calm down! John! Don't you see how we live? We play golf, spend a weekend on the yacht, I go to a party, you, another. John, get me a drink. I'm thirsty as hell! Here you are. Come here. Here's John. This is John? He's from Bari. Why is his name John?! J'avais assez de cette vie. You have a son? Yes, of course. Is that a son? That's a blonde passer-by! Where does he hang out? Come here, Rita. Take a good look at me. Do you see me? Do you see this face? This face launched the collection The Great Loves of Our Time. Alright? I'm thinking clearly. I'm the one who'll go on site. I'm the one who'll go find poor Titino! I'm the one who'll go to Africa! Drop us off at the airport and take the tape to Silvana. Excuse me, sir. I can take it to her myself. - No, you're going with me. - I am? - Yes. - To Africa? What's with the face?! Hadn't I told you?! - No. - No? And why? - Why? - Why, why. Memory lapse, amnesia... Well, sorry. We're stopping at his house to pick up a suitcase. Happy? We're going to Africa! Can you imagine? Finally... an ancient dream comes true. From now on, we're out of this dump. We're just two men leaving to go look for another man. Take something. Don't let me carry everything. - He's filming me. He's right. - Indeed. One, two, one, two, it's me. Testing mic. One, two, one, two, it's me. Testing mic. Travel Diary. Entry no. 1. It's now 06:30. Have left Luanda, on road to Tombwe, last place where Titino was seen. Bought Land Rover, used but in perfect condition, well equipped. Hired Portuguese Durabal, safari guide and great hunter with vast African experience. He speaks Italian well. I'm going to ask him some questions about himself. Do you want to talk a little about yourself? - No. - That's clear. Living in the desert and the long silences of the savannah make these men reserved, taciturn, inscrutable. And a bit obnoxious too. Before nightfall, we'll camp in Mingou. Tomorrow, we'll be in Tombwe. What? Ostriches! - Are these ostriches? - Obviously. Can't you see?! Leave them alone, boss. They're dangerous. Why? Do they attack men? But why? - Water pump obstructed? - No. It happens. What are you doing? Thanks, boss. Magnificent. Euphorbia angolensis, of the euphorbiaceae family, or is it cucurbitaceae, I forget. Superb. Specimen distinctively monandrous and pedunculated. Very similar to our pumpkins. Encyclopedia of the Little Naturalist. Oh God! Look! Our first aborigine! Me, editor Di Salvio. Não há problem. Them, my associates: Palmarini and Durabal. Muito prozero! Me, you, them, all brothers. Hermanos. How do you say that, Durabal? Skin color, no conta nada. Correct. All equal. Durabal, translate! The gentleman wants to communicate with me. Tell him we are all brothers. Durabal! I order you to translate! No! Where are you going? Sir, wait! Why did the gentlemen run away? Durabal! Why did he get scared? Afraid of whites. - But I told you to say we were brothers. - I'm no nigger's brother. Listen, meus caçador! As long as está comigo, you obey. - Understood? - Não. - What d'you mean, no?! - Você está comigo. - Really!? -Sim. Then, from now on, nosotros, no estamos contigo. Did you hear? Pay the gentleman what he's owed. - Right now? - Right now. We'll see who's in charge. I'll teach you to say no. I feel you've already overstayed your welcome. No. No receipt. Fired on the spot. Vamos! Anda, anda, anda! Off you go! Hurry up! Bugger off, go away, get lost! D'you think I'm joking? Take your rags and clear out. You'll see who I am. Are leaving him on foot in the middle of the desert?! Yes, that'll teach him. I'm trying to talk and he wants to boycott it?! No pygmy's brother? Then not mine either. To think you're a compatriot of Janez... - Sandokan's white brother. - Yes. Done yet? He had a motorcycle? It's true we're searching for my brother-in-law, but we're also searching for ourselves. "Truth is self-contradictory," says Mao. In his paperback I published. You made money even on Mao? What's your point? Behold the open spaces! Look at these colors! Look at this sky! Look at nature! Look where you're going! - Turn on the headlights. - I can't find the switch. I can't believe it! You can't drive?! Then say: "I don't know my way around a Land Rover"... I own a Fiat 600. - What are you pulling on? - The ignition. The ignition while we're in motion? What now? The battery has had it. That's why I couldn't find the headlights. You're crossing your arms? - Me too. We'll see what happens. - What do you suggest we do? Entry no 7: After failed attempts to restart the Land Rover, queen of the desert, we have set up camp at exactly 15, maybe 20... even 30 km from Mingou. We'll sleep under the stars, surrounded by darkness. The evening shadows fell suddenly. That happens in the tropics. In the mysterious air, we can hear a distant, insistent tom-tom. A message, a warning? We'll take quarter turns at watch. You take the first. Machete, terrifying weapon in his hands. Ah, if only I was with the faithful Kamamuri instead of you. A pure daydream! Reality is quite different. I'm thinking clearly now. Comfort destroys the individual even more than want. We should rebel: a backpack, some bread, then we hit the wide open road, looking for adventure, just like Titino. Let's stop this rat race. Have we all gone crazy? Villas, pools, fake English majordomo. To hell with our Maseratis. Let's get rid of those fetishes, destroy them. Finished, finished, finished. I don't have all those comforts. Don't destroy them right away. I won't even dignify that with a response. I always knew you were immature. It's possible. Yes, yes, yes, yes! - I brought along someone immature. - You shouldn't have. Take care of the fire and stay away from the wild animals. There are wild animals? - There are wild animals? What animals? - You're the one who said 'it. Let's hope there aren't. The rifle is loaded? Stay alert on your quarterwatch. Why even lie down? I know I won't be able to shut my eyes. "O sickle of moonlight declining "What harvest of visions is waving beneath thy mild lustre." It's your turn, boss. What a deep sleep! In Rome, I need two sleeping pills. Here, I slept straight through. How wonderful. 4 hours felt like 5 minutes. Everything alright? It's almost dawn, but at the tropics it's still dark. - Have a nice sleep. - Thanks, boss. I slept 1/4 hour? You told me to take the first quarterwatch. I must be dreaming! I was talking about a nautical watch: 4 hours each! We're not going to wake up every quarter of an hour. Can you picture that? Oh God... How will I manage to fall asleep again? Boss... What's going on? Where are we? Don't you see? In Mingou. La batteria deve ser substituída, o dinamo nao carrega e sa motore precisa de revisao. - He said: used, but in good condition. - Good. Meu senhor how long does it take para reparar todo? - Your Portuguese is good. - I manage. Desculpa how long does it take para reparar todo? - Eu não entendo senhor. - How long to repair the car? - Dois dias - Two days. - No need to translate. No es posible. Tenimos presa. Soy l'editor De Salvio. Vamos a Tombwe, buscar news about Mr. Sabatini, meu brother-in-law. - How do you say "brother-in-law"? - I don't know. - You never help me! - Com'é o nome que vos el decir? - Soy l'editor De Salvi. And he is Palmarin, my... - No. El nome do cunhado. - ORESTE Sabatini. - ORESTE Sabatini is aquí. Trabalha aquí! No es possibile! Trabalha aqui, no in Tumbue! No, he was seen in Tumbue, one year ago. What do you mean he's here? Na Companhia de transporti "Nocal" a dos kilometros da aqui! - Trabalha aqui?! - Da otra parte do rio. Há Muitos italianos - He works here. - We found him already. Apparently. What does Mr. Sabatini do here? He directs things? Yes, yes! He directs a truck! Here, madam. The map of Africa. Take it, I no longer need it. We're here. Not here, there. Where are you looking? Final entries. 11:00, local time. We have already found my brother-in-law. Soon, I will embrace him, and tomorrow we'll return to Rome. Goodbye, Africa. Dream too soon ended. Boss, there's a plane for Rome tomorrow. With a bit of luck, we'll be able to catch the match. In 24 years, I've never seen you laugh. But we found Mr. Titino. Aren't you happy? What? You want me to dance around with you? Alright, let's dance. Let's make a spectacle of ourselves. Of course I'm happy, but I'm in control of my emotions. Must one always explain everything to you? We're making everyone laugh. 23 sen carro deve partir immediatamente. So, por l'editor De Salvio? Stoy waiting. He said that he chamava, non chama. Attencao, ao 26, Sabatini ORESTE! Attençao, ao 26, Sabatini ORESTE! Sabatini ORESTE. Chama por si, Senhor De Salvo. Di Salvio! Di Salvio! Repitu: ao 26, senhor Di Salvio de Roma! Repitu: ao 26, senhor Di Salvio de Roma chama por si! - Here he is! Titino! It's me! - Is that him? Titino! Stop! - He ran off. - Yes, and at full speed. Now what? - This makes you laugh?! - Of course. The mystery thickens. The chase goes on. Eu preciso buscar in some maneira el senhor who fugiu agora. Italian? Huh? Yes. He's going to Bamanguo. They're all going there. We'll catch up along the way. Campi Benedetto always helps his compatriots. - Careful! - It's my sister. I know her. My love, kiss me Goodbye, my love, kiss me As soon as he heard my name, he fled. Why? Do you remember the night When I kissed you playfully? It seemed like an adventure Because he saw me as a threat to his freedom. Maybe. That I was little by little Falling in love with you My love, forgive me If I'm crying My love, forgive me My love, forgive me, is that him? It's him. - What? - It's a black man. You can bet your ass a white man wouldn't have made way. Shortcut! Do you often go this way? Whenever I'm in a hurry. I know every bump of this road. And you don't miss a single one. Be quiet! You're all we can hear. Quiet. - Another truck? - Rhino. An Italian? Rhino. Rhinoceros. There are lots around here. Rhinoceros? There are lots? You knew this? And you still decided to go this way? - You see it? - No. Here it is. It's true. I'll do a slalom to disorient it. If that doesn't work? Here he is. - A gun! - You'd need a cannon. - Do you see it now? - Yes, boss. Let's switch places. They're not very bright. Who cares about his IQ? He's all turned around. No, he's not. Stop with the slalom. Can't you give in? They can do 100 km/h. He's turning. - I never should have come here. - Take control. Be a man. Don't be scared. Accountant, help! Always the same side! - I'm worried about the body of the car. - Who gives a damn? - I do. - I don't. See how he beat it? Benedetto got the best of him. Benedetto. Your mom still around? - Yes. - You son of a... Hotel Bamanguo. Here's Sabatini's truck. We caught up with him. Thanks. - See you. - I doubt it. Hurry up. Anyone here? Porteiro! Non está ninguno in esto hotel? - Quien es? - Dos extranjeros. - Vamos a veher! Hola, senhor! Good! Friend! Soy l'editor Di Salvio e il senhor mio ragionier y collaborador. Está aquíel senhor ORESTE Sabatini? I knew it. Obrigado. Follow me. Angolan black piglet. - Extremely dangerous. - Does it bite? - No, it spreads cholera. We'll surprise him. - You bastard. - Who is it? It's me, Fausto. I come looking for you and you run away? I'll show you. You're resisting? Titino... Who's this guy? Who are you? Maybe we got the wrong room. He's an impostor. Don't you get it? So that's why he ran away. He wasn't your brother-in-law... Where're you going? Catch him. Come here. Where is my brother-in-law? - I was right. - I no speak Italian. But you play the Italian. I'll loosen your tongue. - Talk! - Let me do it. You're doing it the wrong way. - Talk! - That's what I said. - I'll show you. - Boss! - He said he'd talk and you hit him?! - He said that? He said it. I speak little Italian, learned from Sicilian buddy. Stop fooling around. Spill it. - Here. - I don't smoke, Excellency. - May I, boss? - You smoke now? No, I'm a little shaken. So, let's see. Who are you? Why are you passing yourself off as ORESTE? My real name is Pedro Tomeo. I have economic problems. I not find work for misunderstanding with law. How you say? - How do you say? - Thefts. An error. Judicial error. They refused me work permit. I found suitcase and took Sabatini passport. What suitcase? I found since 2 months in cave. South of Tumbue. In old auro mine. - What is auro? - Gold. - I got that. - Donde? - South of Tumbue. What's this? A bum's suitcase? Trinkets. - Everything is there? - Except passport. This is his. Billiards championship... It's him. What about this? - Boss. - What is it? - A letter to your brother-in-law. - Let's see. - Querido Titino... - Dear Titino. - I got that. "De cuando voce salia de San José, la noche subí em el meu coraçao. Volta aqui, volta aqui, meu pai, uniga luz de mi Alma solitaria. Eu espero para ti, siempre. Te bejo as manos, Tua Maria Carmen." - Who is Maria Carmen? - No sabe nada. She must be good. We finally find a trail, and you're fantasizing about the girl?! Da esta letera, espedida de San José... .. es claro que el senhor Sabatin e Maria Carmen... - Ola! Therefore la senhora sabe... Maybe he went back da esa, in San José. I don't know, aqui la digo, aqui la niego. Did you hear that? We had to hear it from a stranger. Bravo, Pedro! Finally a solid clue. We're going... - To San José? - Yes. To Maria Carmen. A doisiento chilometros da aqui! I come with you. Vossia lucky. Pedro is at your service. I know road like pocket. Vamos! We're ready. Have you come with the coche? - Coche? - The car. It is in reparacao. Vamos a buscarla! Dottor Di Salvio, I've already begun to like a vossia. As soon as we find your brother-in-law I resign... .. and come to Rome with you. - To Rome? - What do you say? - To do what? What did you do before trucking? Little of everything: security guard, procurating whores... - You got the face. - How is it called? - Pimp. Ah! Pimp... I talked with the contabilista and he agreed and now you say no... What a splendid sight! What do you say? What are you doing? The accounts. There's the loan, the furnishings, the bank drafts... We're in front of the Duque de Bragança Falls, one of the grandest sights in nature, where black Africa pours out her candid soul, and you're thinking of drafts? You have no verve, accountant, you only think of accounts. You've lost all fighting spirit. But I'm thinking clearly. Workers have become conservatives. The real conservative is the worker! A new way to insult workers. What have you said? Don't say that about me! - I'm a proletarian of publishing. - Sure. What do you mean, sure? I'm almost sorry I brought you. Do me a favor, and don't talk to me anymore. Very well. But you do the same. Let go of me. - Macaroni? - With tomato sauce, yes. - I'm going to find some piri-piri. - Go, go. Who picked this at the supermarket in Luanda? Macaroni no 3. with this calcium-free water. They'll never cook. When you don't know how to travel, you stay home. This is for stirring the pasta? A ladle? You stay home. You don't come to Africa. If you want something done, you have to do it yourself. - What was that? - A scream. Mr. Fausto! Contabilista! - What happened? - Pigmeo Bambutos. Take to Asuncion, the woman who repulsó me, my last testament. Pedro, pronunciando your name, and remembering his great love... Se ne muere de dolor! Funny, no? You liked joke? The blood is tomato sauce. Pedro is great comedian! Nothing to say! - Pedro little devil! - Imbecil. - Why vossia call me imbecil? - Because you are one. - You not liked? - No! And if you do it again I fire you. Pedro has varied repertory to amuse on trip. It blew up. - The pasta. - It was no 3. Spurred on by the same enthusiasm and carried along at great pace by our dear Land Rover, uncontested queen of the desert, the accountant Palmarini, Pedro the gypsy and I have all decided to stop in the shadow of ancient palm trees. Suddenly, in this oasis of peace and cool, the echo of a distant choir greeted our arrival. We had arrived in San José. Desculpa esto es San José? - Missão San José. - Oh, misión San José... Vosse cognosce Maria Carmen. Senhorita Maria Carmen? Soy l'editor Di Salvio. Mr. Di Salvio, why nos Vamos a la escuela for children to ask about Maria Carmen? Irma, encontrasi aqui senhorita Maria Carmen? Está a levares meninos. Dottor Di Salvio... Está aqui. The woman at the wash basin. Good, let's go see her. I'll take care of the coche. Take it. Excuse me. Senhorita Maria Carmen? - Sister. - Ah, nun? No, converted novice. Congratulations, senhorita. Easy. What are you doing?! Stop it, Epifanio! You let them play with water? - Excuse me, they're children. - Oh please, I adore children. You speak Italian? Yes, a little. I learned from an Italian. - ORESTE Sabatini? - You know him? - He's his relative. - Es verdad? Relative of Father Sabatini? Father who? - Pardon me, senhorita. - Father François! She said: Father ORESTE Sabatini. He became a priest... Le quatrième de gauche est Padre Titino. The photo was taken... when he left the mission, the day of the feast of St. Joseph, our patron saint. A delightful character, Father Titino! You're his beautiful brother? No, he's the beautiful brother. - Brother-in-law. - Yes. Forgive me for my poor Italian. Oh, quel dommage que Father Titino stayed such a short time with us. He was an enlightened cleric and a great entomologist. - Entomologist?! - Oui, voyez. He was the one who advised us to expand our butterfly collection and to undertake trades with Europe. Mais look at this beautiful specimen: eribeia angolana. Catocala ipsipila. Zerynthia eudamippo. But the queen of our collection is this one: caligo prometheus. Look at those magnificent colors: a veritable flying flower. - Know how much it's worth? - How much? - 300 dollars! - 8,000 lira. Wow! Excusez-moi, mon père, mais Father Titino, where is he now? In Vacumbos. Father Sabatini's latest project is this: to build a mission like this one. A mission?! Where? - What do you mean where? - In Vacumbos. I got that, I want to know. Oh, thank you. - What is it? - Hippopotamus. - Here. - No... It's very good. Thank you. - There's some cod. - No. I'll take some ham. No, thanks. No, Padre Cerioni. Por você ou leche. Excusez, mon père... Father Titino knew this girl well? Oui, bien sûr. The young girl, last year, had the horrible profession of... How do you say... along le chemin de fer? - It's an ugly word. - No, in Italian, the road of iron. - Railroad. - Exactly. Here's another word I've learned. Father Titino is the one who converted her. And now, this young girl... She is truly pure and happy with her new life. - And all this was made by Father Titino? - Ja! Exactement. What is Fellini working on? Who's that? Since you're thinking clearly, do you believe in Mr. Sabatini's conversion? Do I believe in it? Well... Listen, my dear. I'm wondering about Father Sabatini and I'd like to find an answer. I mean... To what extent can an individual, half way through his life, manage to change? Because Titino has changed. And I've changed too, a little. You, have you changed? May I? I believe in my brother-in-law's conversion. Dottor Di Salvio, el coche is fixed. Well done. Open up! Open up! Hurry! Who is it? Oh God! Wake up! It's us. Come on, open up. - What is it? - Where is the caligo prometheus? - What? - The butterfly, where did it go? - What butterfly? - Short jokes the best. Give us back the butterfly, it's worth 300 dollars. Mon père, how dare... Out with the butterfly, you... - He's gone. - Qu'est-ce que c'est?! Did you call assembly? He even stole the car. Are you happy now? He gets up, builds a dummy, and what are you doing? Moron. Sleeping?! And you, you weren't asleep? Sure... Always ready to contradict me, eh? - Me? - Yes, you. Let's drop it. Muito obrigado, senhora. Excuse us, but we suffered a great loss. The Land Rover, all the equipment we bought in Luanda, not to mention the prior's butterfly. He's a saint, Père François. Santo pessoa... He demanded 300 dollars, your saint... And abroad they say that Italians are thieves. In Italy, we call crooks Portuguese. Nós chamamos "italianos". Todo el mundo es paes. Muito obrigado. Our trip was able to continue thanks to Father François, who entrusted us to a nice Portuguese couple, who have kindly agreed to drive us to Vacumbos, the site of my brother-in-law's mission. How wonderful. Give me the camera. The lenses! Tenho pena! Não tenho mais! Wait! Kids! Meninos, meninos! - Beautiful, eh? - Very, but they're gone. Tra 12 chilometros jegaremos a Vacumbos. It's about time. Porcos diabus! La furia do rio rombao el punte! Craio! Meu senhor, no está outra road? No. Outra rua sta a 20 chilometros da aqui. Não vale a pena. Not worth it, you say? Espera. Espera aqui por mim. Florinda! Espera! Vão a buscar ayuda y volto aqui rapidamente. Easy. - What did he say? - That he'll be back soon. Let's get back on the bank, quickly. Vamos! Força! Todos juntos! Vamos trabalhar todos juntos! Fernando! Fernando! Mira quel loco! Malandro! Trabalha como os outras! Vamos! Vamos malandro! Vamos! Tudo bem! Está bem. Todo feito. Tudo em ordem. Podemos passar. Adeus, senhor, adeus! Senhor! Senhor! Pode vir! Here we are. Ah, não, muito obrigado, senhora. Thanks for the ride. We're getting off. Well continue on foot. Ah bem, porque? Because we'd like to stretch our legs. - Right? - Gladly. Let's go. Senhor, que se passa?! Que acontecer? Nothing strange. We want to walk. It's good to walk. - Thanks for the ride, and sorry for the inconvenience. - Goodbye. É por la nossa maneira de tratar os negros. Ei! Ei, senhor! Espera! - Don't turn around. - Um momento, quero parlar con tigo! Não passa embora! Está me ouvindo, senhor? Um momento! Se você pretende fazer qualquer afirmação sobre maneira de tratar os pretos: Primero! Isso não é com você! Segundo! Os pretos faço trabalhar como bem me parece, entendeo? E ninguém tem nada com isso. Tercero! Aqui tenho que se ganha ajudar os comunista como vocês. - É claro? - Very. Don't get mad. Say goodbye to him. Adios, senhor. Goodbye. Vá para o diabo tu y isto pedaço de cornudo! - What did he say? - What? I want to know what he said. - Pedaço de cornudo. - I don't know what it means. Pedaço no, but cornudo yo do. You've never understood Portuguese. Just drop it. As usual. Pedaço de cornudo yourself! - Has he stop? - Yes. - Is he coming? - Yes. You had to say it, And now? Fernando! Cuidado! Se matam! Fernando! Fernandinho! Assassinos! Desleales! Velhacos! Meterse im dois!... And if we had been 3, all 3 would have gotten down to it. Do I have a black eye? No, boss. - What? - Your nose. Like when I was a kid. Our trip was able to continue thanks to Father François, who entrusted us to a nice Portuguese couple... Let's go. Boss... - Thank you. - Not at all. Senhore, você és il motorista? Motorista é ele. Desculpa me senhore, soy l'editor Di Salvio... - He can't hear anything. - He doesn't... Que és? Mosca del suono? - No, he's drunk. - Alright... - What do we do? - What can we do? Oh God, dottò... Não travão. You don't want to work. I'll make you work... Boss, travão is the brake. - There's no brake. - No brake? Oh God, there's no brake! Why didn't you tell me sooner? - What were you thinking?! - What d'you mean?! Está preso. Estragam de animais. I'll pay. Two goats and a chicken: 300 escudo. Next one. - Que dice? - Trezentos escudos, quatro porcos. Four pigs: 300 escudo. Here. - What? - 700 escudos, uma vaca. 700 escudo for a cow. - We're ruined, boss. - Who breaks pays. - Next one. - Uma cabra. Cem escudos. One goat: 100 escudo. Dois sacos de sal. Quinze escudos. Two bags of salt: 15 escudo. To the negus. - Boss? - E? What? It was true. This is the mission my brother-in-law is building. And you who were skeptical... Father Titino! Father Titino! Who spoke? Who spoke? It sounds like a parrot. It sounds like a parrot. Are you the watchman? Are you the watchman? Do you know Father Titino? Do you know Father Titino? - Who is that? - Who is that? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I got it. we're leaving. Yes, that's better. - Are you looking for ORESTE Sabatini? - Yes. - Come with me. - Where? Come, let's follow him. Father Titino lives here? Nothing... Quiet like a tomb this one. Look how lovely this is. - Is he home...? - Wait here. Old beam, can fall down. That's all we need. Watch out. There, I knew it. Beam fall down. He had the wrong beam. Who is it? There's no one. Where are you going? Come back here. You're looking for Titino? Friends of the engineer? Well, he's an engineer now. Yes. Friends of the engineer. He's here? Mein Name ist Genevieve. Kommen Sie. With pleasure, miss. We've come a long way to find ORESTE... Where is she taking us? We don't know. No one speaks here. Titino, Titino, you have visitors. We've finally found our... So that' s why... "4 March 1968". How did it happen? He was playing the violin. I was accompanying him on the piano. He loved the violin, the birds, the rain. When it rained, he would rush outside. Pneumonia? He came here to build the hotel you see over there. A hotel?! It's not a church? The work was half way through, when a horrible snake bit one of the workers. Titino cut, pressed, sucked... He saved the man's life. But he died 5 minutes later. "Pulvis es... "et in pulverem reverteris." You call him an engineer, but actually he was... A Dominican Father? Yes, I know. He had a crisis. He wanted to become Shintoist. He used to say, Shinto Buddhists were the happiest of men. - Is it true? - I don't know. - Is it true? - Perhaps. Marisa, I'm sorry. I arrived too late. Titino was already... He was...? He was dead. Marisa! Marisa, don't! Marisa! Why? Why, Marisa?... Sad epilogue to a sad story. Let's get in here. Is there a dining car? - Não, senhor. - Thank you. Mr. Di Salvio! Contabilista! I ran after you in Vacumbos. Look who's here! I have great news. You son of a bitch! I can explain. Explain what? That you're a lousy thief? Come here, gypsy! He has the nerve to come back. And with my hat. Go away! Lousy thief! I'll turn you in for robbing strangers. Dear boss, don't be mad. I have great news. Get the hell out of here! Desculpa me, boss. It's fault of woman who me repulso. In Saba Bandeira I found her with annother man. Um aviação sergeant. You should be ashamed to take advantage of Italians. Dottor Di Salvio, on the ferry that took me I learned from a river captain where is your friend Titino. De verdade, eu sei onde está Titino. Enough with your yarns. Titino is dead. He died on March 4th. Não! Não é possível! - Is it far? - I don't know. - Take out the map. - You gave it to that black woman. Isto é o way you thank me de tudo... - What day is the feast of San José? - Who is San José? - Saint Giuseppe. - Well? On March 19th. If Titino's photo was taken at the mission on March 19, St. Joseph day, how did he die on the 4th? Simple. On March 19th, his photo was taken, on the 4th, he died... It's true. It's not possible. Pedro! - Pedro! - No! No! Come on, get in. - I can? You forgive? - Thank the accountant. - Thanks, contabilista. - Keep your hands to yourself! Something hard. Then? What? There's only a violin here. Just a violin?! Nothing else?! She said he played the violin. See tenho razão? Then, it's true: he's alive! - You were right. Bravo. - Thank you. - Ubaldo, let's be informal. - With pleasure. Why this grave? Pedro, where did you say Titino was? - You're taking me? - Alright, talk! 6 months ago, he was seen in Tampala Baniè. - Tampala Baniè? - Yes! Why does this macabre mise en scène? - Hey, you, stop! - My God! Who is it? - A black man. - The majordomo. Let go of him. Make him talk. Let go of him. Catch him. The grave was empty. ORESTE isn't dead. We won't hurt you. Why say he was dead? The grave, it was his idea. Then he left. Soldiers came to get him. And your mistress? The poor lady doesn't know anything. The lady is loca. He says the lady is crazy. I suspected it. I wanted to tell you. - Tell who? - You. You're being informal? Entry no 21. On the track of Titino once again. This shadowy figure, named ORESTE Sabatini, seems to slip away every time we get close. He takes refuge in the heart of the African darkness. Reread "Heart of Darkness" by Conrad. Enlightened by our Pedro and by a rare stroke of genius from accountant Palmarini, we are returning to Vacumbos... A lion? He has seen us... - He's afraid. - Oh yes? How is he afraid? Quiet or he'll flee. Let's make noise. What if he doesn't flee? Do you believe this guy? - Drive. - Reverse. Forward, reverse... just drive. What is he doing now?! He stops?! Wait, where are you going? Kill the lion. - Kill it? - Não gusta trophy? Moments worth a lifetime. I stared at the lion, and the lion stared back. I take aim with my Brown. The cat jumps on me and I shoot... I bring it down with two shots here. Check: one and two. - Let's go. - Quick or he'll leave. Easy. - Wait. Do you hunt? - Every Sunday. - Kneel down. - Thanks, boss. Not at all. - Dottor Faust... - Yes. Aim for chest. Aim straight, please. - Contabilista... - Yes. Você, aim o costado. Yeu will hit it in the middle of the forehead. 2 shots each: chest, costado, eyes. Ta bem? - Ready? - Fuego! He's leaving? We won't talk about this. - Better, well forget about it. - Yes, boss. Bravo. Hunter, eh? - They're stealing everything. - Por favor! Por favor! Meu senhor, what are you doing?! - Es private property! E roba mia! - Shut up! Not es contrabando, es personal effects. - Give me the rifle! - The rifle? Here. Soy l'editor Di Salvi... There's even a senhorita. - What maneira? - Give me your shoes. You want the shoes? Right away. - He slapped you! - Who, me?! Eu sou portugues. Give up your rifles. Let's avoid diplomatic incidents. Let's control our indignation. Give up your shoes. Above all, let's stay united. I just took a kick. What ' s this? - Who is coming? - I have no idea. Vous vous comportez comme des bandits! Mais c'est des Européens ça! Je vais vous dresser, vous allez voir. Vous n'êtes pas des soldats. Vous êtes des cabrons! You think these gasses make you a commander? Macaque! Excusez-moi, messieurs... Je suis l'éditeur Di Salvio. Mes collaborateurs: raggionier Palmarini et Pedro Ladron, notre guide. - Italians... - From Rome. Rapidement! Everything back in its place. We're always on the verge of loving Italy. But Italy always manages to make itself hated. Eu sou portugues! I think le contraire. We're always on the verge of hating Italy, but Italy always manages to make itself loved. Merci, monsieur le commandant. Thank the commander. He's from the South. Forgive my soldiers, mais trois journées since we've eaten... He's fainted! What do we do? - Spaghetti? - With garlic? The life of a mercenary is hard without a war... We're reduced to pillaging. Savez-vous how they used to call me? Kochembe. Le Leopard. And here's what's left of Le Leopard... My men were les affereux most feared in the Congo. But because of a damned Italian, a horrible, ugly man, who came to the Congo-Angola border to sell me arms... I give him all my money. 10,000 pounds. Have you seen those arms? - No. - Moi non plus. Gone with the money. Without arms, my battalion, under attack from the enemy... flees. We escaped to Angola. I knew that this traitor was in Angola. A month ago, I learned that he died in Vacumbos, bitten by a snake. Good for him. I went to Vacumbos and spit on his grave. Qu'est-ce que je pouvais faire d'autre? I gave up the hunt. But I know Italians aren't all the same. Rome est très belle... I Her homemade cuisine: bucatilli alla marchinaccia, fettunicce mantecalle, scattimbocca saltadito, popottette ciancicatte... Popottette ciancicatte! You know everything! Bravo! Monsieur le commandant. Cigarette? One for later. Je vous en prie. ...in Vacumbos, a shocking turn of events. The grave was empty. ORESTE Sabatini was alive. It was all a ploy. It was all a ploy. He had been seen in Tampala Baniè. We have crossed the Tropic of Capricorn. We're under the Southern Cross constellation. Light emotion. Clouds to the northeast. No, to the northwest. Anyway, clouds. Nice toy. Oui, très mignon. Notre homme est à Tampala Baniè. - What did he say? - I don't know. They're taking the car. What are you doing?! Commander! No, don't take the car! How will we manage? Enlevez vos chaussures! I want to find Titino with your shoes. Coronel! Eu sou portugues! Eu sou portugues! You come as our guide. We can't leave them here. It's very dangerous. Senhorita! That is meu hat! They took everything. - Are you happy? - It's my fault? - What a scoundrel. - Mercenaries are always mercenary. Not the mercenary. I mean my brother-in-law. Thank you. Where are we going? This will surprise you, but I'm still thinking clearly. While you, with your mediocre man's wisdom, do not. Which way is north? Ah, the contabilista doesn't know... Well go straight. Sooner or later, well find a thing... - A kind of... - Of what? Never mind. Of agglomeration! I hope the mercenary has found Titino and killed him. That hope is the only sentiment we have in common. Otherwise, know that I despise you. You ruined even further this lousy trip in this goddamn lousy country. We don't love Africa anymore? - Accountant! - What? You're fired. Thank you, publisher Di Salvio. I can finally tell you that you're a clown. Save your spit. And you, stop running. Nope. I'm running. You have no character. Else you would have stopped me from going on this adventure. Can I tell you something from the bottom of my heart? Don't bother. This cover is worthless. What cover? A plane! Help! They never stop. - We're in a jam. - I told you so. I forbid you to say: " I told you so." Accountant! Accountant! - Accountant! - What? Get up! To get out of this, we have to keep walking. As long as we're standing up, and even on all fours... To stop would mean to die. You see them? They're watching us. They start with the eyes. I'm warning you: if you stop, I won't wait for you! Have you read the Jack London story about 2 gold prospectors lost in the Klondike? No. Don't you ever read anything? You're a yahoo. I'd even say you're... Will you shut up? I'm sorry. What? I'm not answering you. My foot, my foot, boss. - I must to shut up. - Dottore! Dottore! Oh God, a trap. I fell into a trap. Quickly! The blood is going to my head! Yes, well done. Come give me some support. My ankle is killing me. - Have you read the story by Jack London? - Come back here! I said that earlier just to... How do you say...? Come back! I'm giving you a raise. Accountant! Ubaldo! I beg you, Ubaldo! Stop, come back! You can't abandon me! You'll feel bad for the rest of your life! Where will you go by yourself? We have to stay united. Ubaldo! My little Ubaldo! Thank you, Ubaldo. Thanks for coming back. My faithful friend. I knew you were a good man deep down. Accountant! - Who's that? - The trap's owners. - They're not fleeing? Don't they fear white men? - Apparently not. Oh no? Accountant! Accountant! Where did the accountant go? Accountant! He left me alone. Accountant! Accountant! Accountant! - Are you feeling better, boss? - Do I look like it? Where did they take us? There's no one here. What? Stay close to me. - It's the feiticeiro. - No, the sorcerer. - Feiticeiro, in Portuguese. It's a prayer. It's a white man. Ubaldo! But this man looks like... It's him! Your brother-in-law?! - Yes. - No way! It's him! Titino! Titi! Titi! It's me, Fausto! Italians? Are we Italians? But... it's Mr. Di Salvio, your brother-in-law. - He doesn't know who you are? - Oh, he knows. Isn't that right? You'd better tell us, if you're still Italian, what you're doing here. It's on you to tell me why you came here. Why are we here, accountant? And what if we told you we were here to talk? What do you want to talk about? About the fact that it's been 3 years since you left home. And a year since we lost track of you. - That you have a wife. - How is Marcella? Marcella? Marisa. - Yes, Marisa. - Good start. What is she up to? What is she up to? She cries and she drinks. Lots of people cry. You too make people cry. - I do? Since when? - Since always. You left tracks everywhere. We wouldn't be here otherwise. You burned down half of Africa. Accountant? Help me out. You wanted to come. Jump in. Me? What can I say? Oh, yes! There's someone looking for you. Gomez, the miner? Bratislav, the Yugoslavian? Gonzalvo, the planter? He burned down the other half too. The head of the mercenaries. The Leopard, without beliefs or morals. - And without a homeland. - Without a cent, too. - You ripped him off 10,000 pounds. - I did? That's irrelevant. Don't mix everything up with your European way of thinking. You know what he wanted? - What did he want? - Weapons. - Do I have weapons? - No, that's why he's coming here. The Leopard? How did he find out? Who told him? Boss, tell him how... Never mind, it's not important. He knows that you're in Tampala Baniè. - This isn't Tampala Baniè. - So much the better. - We're in the Dead Lands. - That's cheerful. But what are you doing here, amidst this lost tribe? Nothing. They're friends. It never rains here. It hasn't rained for 6 months. I'm trying to help them. You know how to make rain? I'm trying. Who's he? Him? No one. Palmarini. Don't you remember? Don't you remember me? Marisa. I know she must have suffered. It was hard for me too. You say I burned down Africa. But I had to struggle every single day. Until... Please. What did she tell you? May I go? And on the hill? Why did they all scream? What did you tell them? That tonight, it will rain. Why do you look at me? He's your brother-in-law, not mine. - What? - Monkey's milk. - Here. - Have you promised rain before? - Never. Then why promise them today? Ouamande. - What? - Ouamande? How do you say...? It's... something you feel. - Premonition? - No, that's not it. It's more, much more than that. It's... - It's like... - Telepathy? - Not at all. - Stay out of it. You sense an event without knowing if it will happen. In Italian, you say... There's no word for it. - No word? - No. Like, the other night, while I was doing the Rua-a-maka, the hymn propitiatory to the moon, I sensed that someone was coming. And you came. It's odd, but right now, I sense... I sense that someone is coming. It's like a noise getting closer. Yes, yes. It's getting closer. I feel it. Guess what, I hear it too. It's a car. - Who can it be? - The Leopard. Of course. - He found me. - Didn't sense that one, eh? - No. Il connait pas Sabatini. Hi, Leopard! Salut, hyena. I searched all of Tampala Baniè. And I find you here. Tell those animals to lower their ridiculous spears. It's true, they're not very scary. Your guys are better equipped. Yet I would be leery of those spears. They've been using them for thousands of years. They're all on you. If your guys shoot, I'll die, but you, you'll definitely look like a pin cushion. Kangama, we're talking. Careful, colonel. I know these guys, they willing to die, not afraid of death. In a treatise on strategy, Von Clausewitz wrote, "war is art, not arithmetic." "The chaplains will count the dead." Accountant, are you scared? No, I have a mild headache. My only goal is to see you dead. About the rest, je m'en fous. As you wish. But, first, let's my friends off. They have nothing to do with this. Wait. May I say something? Excuse me. How dare you? Don't you know who I am? I have connections all over. If people find out you left us shoeless in the desert, you'll pay for it. Just drop it. You'd better leave. This guy wants a fight. - Tell Mariolina... - Marcella. Marisa. Marisa, yes. Ask her to forgive me. - Of course. - You too, forgive me. Not at all. Which way to Rome from here? Let's see. No, wait. 15 km from here, there's a boat that goes to Port Alexander. Ask for Vasco. - The village women will go with you. - When are you coming home? I have no idea. You see the spot I'm in. Take this. Give it to Marcella, from me. No, III give it to Marisa, alright? Yes, to Marisa. Et ça, c'est quoi, Titino? Nothing. A few rocks. A little memento for my wife. It's all I have. Et pourquoi did you have these rocks on you? To perform exorcisms. To make it rain. Je suis mercenary. For money, I kill or I don't kill. Instead of envoyer these diamonds to your widow, you give them to me, and your wife is no longer a widow. Diamonds? These? I thought you were smarter. Rocks to make rain. Some pieces of glass, diamonds? Then it won't bother you if I take them? We forget Von Clausewitz, we avoid a massacre and I go back to Belgium. D'accord? - You! Take as pedras! - Yes, Colonel! You're very crafty, Monsieur Sabatini. Desculpa. Tu étais presque fooled me, parole de soldat. Avec cette histoire de caillou pour la pluie. Mais le Leopard est plus fourbe que toi. Hurry up, Pedro. But you're very capable, monsieur Sabatini. You'll make rain, even without rocks. Bye, Titino! Lovely little braids. You're very smart, congratulations. Are you Italians? The rain. Who's this guy? Tell Elena, Margherita, Mariolina, to forgive me. - Marisa. - So now it comes back to him. Buffoon! A diamond lode! That's why you're here! The rain. what rain? I finally know who you are. Ouamande! There does exist a word for it. It does! The word for Ouamande is... - Thief. - You are a thief! A crook, an exploiter. You're here to exploit these poor people. You take advantage of their naiveté. Look at these honest faces. Open, loyal, trusting faces... Who's the chief here? Madam, the witch doctor is here only for the diamonds. Miss, hell fleece you. He's robbing you. You've trusted... Leave it. Italians aren't all like him. Here he is, the high priest. - Put this on. - What? We can't leave dressed like this. "We" are leaving? I'm coming to Rome with you. To Rome? What about the diamond mine? Diamonds? What diamonds? These? Worthless rocks. Ferrous quartz. They're allover this place. Rocks? You deceived The Leopard? Me? You white people are strange. I told him 100 times they were just worthless rocks. They're worthless? So why are you really here? Eat something. There are no restaurants on the way. Good, eh? What is it? Meat of... How do you say? What do you call that animal who's all...? With three things there... The eye, a bit... Right. I'm not hungry. - Do you have a comb? - Here. Ouch! Darn, what's this? Thanks. I didn't understand how it worked. Titino! But it's raining... So? Come on, accountant. Let's go. Oh God! Who's there? - Mr. Di Salvio. - Of course... - I run away. When the colonel finds out that they're rocks, things will get ugly. See? He caught on. - A jeweler? - A student of yours. I bring your hat, Mr. Fausto. Pedro vem convosco. They've already discovered our escape. If they catch up with us, they'll make you pay for taking me. - Are they mean? - Not mean, just warriors. Let's go. - Watch out for the arrows. - Are they poisoned? - We go? - Yes. Is it ravines all the way? Is it far? No, just behind the hill. You see it? Then it's all flat for 15 to 20 km. Quickly, Dottor Di Salvio. Sou o capitão. Saudação para todos. Obrigado capitan Vasco! Para mim e para meus amigos! Bem vindo, José Maria! Levantar ferro! José Maria?! An old story. I used to be called that. Of course, what with the braids. O mar! Está minha vida! Sou marinheiro! What are they saying? It' s a greeting. Titi, don't go! Titi, don't go! Dog. Blindman. Cane. Umbrella. Water. Wine. Host. Barrel. Cork. Corkscrew. Bottle. Flask. Straw. Hay. Peace. Pacific. Atlantic. Titi, don't go! Where are you going? Stop! Wait! Boss! What are you doing? You want to jump too? You want to jump too? I don't know. I'm not thinking clearly. Documento Film thanks the people of Angola for their cooperation during the making of the film and the crew's stay in Africa, and Mr. Felipe de Solms, shooting coordinator in Angolan territory.
