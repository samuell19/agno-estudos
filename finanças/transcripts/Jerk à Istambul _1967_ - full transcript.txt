So, that's it, you're not racing with me on Sunday? I promised Monique. She's been on me for months. I can't go to your rally. That's too bad. It won't be the same with Alain. -Thanks. -No problem. I wasn't trying to be nice. Hey, give me a hand. Hey! It's been a while since we've gotten this one stuck in the mud… 90,000 miles! She'd be a dream for the right guy. If he shows up someday, she's all his! He'd better turn up soon before she ends up in a museum. NATIONAL USED CAR DEALERSHIP -Hello, Nicole. -Hello, Vincent. -Doing well? -Yes, sir. -As usual, nothing for you, Nicole? -No, thank you. Shall we get back to our bet? For 20 measly francs again? It's even better when it's pointless. -Who's turn is it? -Yours. 4… 5… 2… Sold. 4, 5, 2… -Hello. -Hi. -Miss. -Ma'am. You're here already? I'm warning you. Don't even try to get out of it. This time, I'm getting my weekend. -You sure I didn't change my mind? -If you're ready, let's go. -Shall we go? -See you Tuesday. Have a good weekend! Hey, if we end up winning, put a bottle of Champagne on ice. You can count on me. We've won a million francs, my love. Can you believe it? What are you going to do now? I'm going to the bank to exchange them for cash. -And then? -And then, we'll see. -Hello, Nicole. -Hello, Vincent. Here, catch. Go on, open it. -Is it for me? -Yes, if you like it. It's very beautiful, thank you. But why did you do this? Because you're pretty, and because you're a stylish girl. Have you seen Grégoire? Grégoire stopped by quickly this morning. He said he was on a big job. You'll never guess, I sold the Triumph. For how much? -1, 2… -Well done. I was afraid I wouldn't find you! You were wrong. Here I am. -Have you seen Grégoire? -Not yet. Don't waste your time waiting. He's not coming. -Why, is he sick? -No, he left. He left, you know what I mean? He said I wasn't ideal. That he hasn't loved me for a long time. -Go on, I'm listening. -All that money went to his head. He had us all fooled. Me and you. This has been in the works a long time. You got on his nerves. Hey, don't cry. You'll make your mascara run. -It was nice of you to tell me! -Only you can bring him back to me. You know where the jerk ran off to? Of course, he didn't tell me. But on the phone, I heard he was at Orly. Ah, I see where this is going. Nicole, I'm leaving you in charge. -Do the best you can. -Yes, Boss. Are you going to the police? These things are done man to man. Will you bring him back? Him, I'm not sure, but definitely my money. PARIS AIRPORT Hey jerk, didn't you see I was going to-- -Sorry, I'm in a hurry. -This isn't how it works. You'll be hearing from me! Attention: Passengers traveling to Rome, Athens, Istanbul, and Ankara. Flight 702 is ready for immediate departure from gate number 45. Departure to Rome, Athens, Istanbul… PARIS AIRPORT I'll be six hours behind him, but that's fine. I'll settle up with him in Istanbul. Yes, I'll send you a check before I leave. Uh-huh. OK, Nicole, I'll take your advice. Yes, but remember, I'm not going on a leisure trip. OK, see you soon. At least I hope so! HOTEL SULEYMANIYE 5:08 P.M. Thank you. -Are you going to Milan? -No, Istanbul. Oh, you're lucky. It's a wonderful city. That's great. -Are you on business? -Yes. Ah, that doesn't surprise me. No excitement… Ladies and gentlemen, Air France would like to inform you that flight 507 to Milan and Istanbul has been delayed. Please visit the restaurant where dinner will be served. Thank you. Oh, this is terrible! I was expected for dinner in Milan! Here! Be nice and help me out. That's not really my thing. Well, make an effort, and that will change. TURKISH BANK OF COMMERCE Every hour is the same In the hourglass of life When we are together… Waiter? -Whiskey, sir? -No, the wine list. Because with you, I forget I forget to stay on solid ground And how I've been hurt Because only you could fit the mold Of what I've been searching for It is a tall order, you know Come, no need to wait any longer Come, it's time to understand That every moment is the same In the hourglass of life But if we leave together One second will have its moment… -Here you are, sir. -Thank you. So, what's the point in waiting? True love is on the way Let's hurry, it will not wait True love has arrived True love has arrived Let's hurry, it will not wait True love has arrived True love has arrived True love has arrived A camellia, sir? The whole basket. Keep the change. A modest gift from an admirer of your beauty and talent. Thank you. Have you been in Istanbul a while? I just arrived. I'm looking for a guide to show me the city. I even need help choosing my champagne. Moët & Chandon '55? Good idea. That's my favorite champagne. I hate drinking alone. Then order a bottle and two glasses. I'll go change and be back to help a Frenchman in need. Great! How's your arm, Boss? It'll be fine in a week. You frightened me! What manners! Don't bother. Say, the funny guy who gave you the flowers, do you know him? No, but we're going to get to know one another. I saw that. Try to get his name, the hotel he's at, and why he's here. I want to know who this guy is. You'll be her guardian angels, understood? Got it, Boss. -You don't sing anywhere but here? -Oh, no. -Why not? -Aren't you curious! I like you. Isn't that enough? No, I had a problem. With a lover? No, with drugs. -You? -Yes, me. That's hard to believe. You're wrong. Haven't you ever done something stupid? No… Well, not like that. -You're lucky. Be careful. -And then what happened? During a stopover, I met Samos, the boss here. You had a pretty voice, so he blackmailed you. Is everything a joke to you? I didn't mean it. I'm sorry, keep going. He gave me fake documents and a work visa. And you became his favorite singer. You don't believe me? Maybe I shouldn't. What can they be talking about? The boss told her to ask questions, so that's what she's doing. Why did you share that with me? Because some days you just feel like talking to someone. I'm scared, and you… I have to play the hero with a big heart. -Oh, seriously. -Don't get upset. You promised to show me Istanbul. Is that still on the table? Yes. But you may be the one showing me the secrets of the Golden Horn. -So, can I meet this Samos guy? -Right now? I also have a favor to ask of him. -Is it pressing? -It's urgent! -What did he say? -Nothing. He wants to see the boss. Very well. Come in. This man wanted to speak with you. Let him in. Leave us. Have a seat. A Turkish cigarette, the sweetest… Thank you, but I don't like sweets. Something I can do for you? Perhaps… -Where are you from? -Paris. I'm on the run. I don't like my name anymore, and I intend to travel. If you have the means, it can be arranged. How much? 2,000 dollars. When will I have it? Here, tomorrow night, at the same time. At that price, along with my transcripts, what else am I getting? I don't like funny guys! Me neither. See you tomorrow. -Not decorated yet? -No. Get rid of it. As you wish, Boss. I really don't like that guy. -Taxi, please. -Very good. Right away, sir. What address, sir? -I'll tell him myself. -As you wish, sir. -Follow him, Ralph. -OK. HOTEL SULEYMANIYE You find the misfortune of others amusing, eh? Hey, it's comforting, Boss! Did you sleep well, Mr. Varèze? Extremely well, Mustafa. The city of wonders awaits. It's the most beautiful city in the world, sir, but you have to know where to look. I'll do my best. I have a guide who knows it very well. -Goodbye. -Good day, sir. He's French. He arrived yesterday. His guide must be a pretty lady. Taxi! The Blue Mosque. Hey! This isn't what we agreed to. Where are you going? You know, you're incorrigible. We told you to notify us when foreigners are staying. But, that's precisely what-- Shut up, fool. You talk too much. You know Samos. He likes to be obeyed, doesn't he? If you do it again, we'll close your hotel. It's the Frenchman you're after? That's right. Now, give me his key. If you can't see anything, you'll have nothing to tell. If Samos said he hid the money in his room, he must be right. It would be best for us to find it now. You're right, let's hurry up and find it. Start with the curtains. Go ahead, have fun! Varèze… Grégoire Varèze. I've been looking all over Istanbul. I have an urgent message for him. I know all of my customers' names by heart, sir. There's no Grégoire Varèze here. -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. That's too bad. -The Hilton, perhaps? -I just came from the Hilton. -Pera Palace? -Is it far? Mesrutiget Boulevard. On your way down Galata. To my right is Hagia Sophia, a church turned mosque. A Byzantine masterpiece. And now it's a museum. -A postcard? -No, thank you. How did you get so beautiful? Mohammed the Conqueror ended the Middle Ages on May 29, 1453. Stop… The tour is over. I'm hungry. -Do you know a place on the Bosporus? -I can find something. I feel great right now. I've been blessed. Everything is good. You're very lucky. And I'd like to share it. Samos is very jealous. And I'm very much in love. I've got money, I'm available, I plan to travel, and you're a perfect guide. -What about Samos? -I'm meeting him tonight. I'll arrange everything. I'm telling you, it's a lucky day! Oh, look! SHELL: LEADER IN MOTOR OIL -Hello! -Hello, sir. -Two Helyaci. -They're very fresh this morning. Mr. Varèze, please? -Mr. Varèze? -Varèze. Excuse me while I check. No, he's not here, sir. Perhaps at Park Hotel? Where is that? Go out and to the left. It's on the other side of Taksim Square. A few hundred meters away. Very good, I'll go see. Thank you. Thank you. Two glasses of sherbet. Here you go. Goodbye. May I drive? If you know how. I trust you. You should. Here we go. OK, that's good. You aren't going to mesmerize the tourists. But we've seen worse. Go on. I'll call you soon. And you're no better. -You're a clumsy bunch. -Believe me, Boss. We searched everywhere. It's true! We saw him leave with his camera. He must have hidden the treasure inside. You shine, when you speak for yourself. Check, you never know. Isn't this thing a bit of a stretch? The guy needs a brand new passport. He'll be back tonight. Did Mustafa tidy everything up in case he comes back? We had to push him around a bit, but I must say that Ralph is always a bit too meticulous. When he gets here tonight, bring him directly to my office, understood? -Understood. -Understood. Now get the hell out of here. Hello, Nikos? Hey, it's me. Say, are you still going to the sea tonight? Yes. I have a customer for you. Calm down. You'll find your account as you left it. Luigi and Ralph will deliver the package tonight, OK? Cheers. Jean Granay, engineer. I was nice. A petroleum engineer should be able to travel. Here's your 2,000 dollars. How about you give me your real passport? A few modifications and we could use it for another guy. Sorry, I left it in my room. You're a suspicious kid. You're wrong. That's not nice for friends who help you out. Listen, Samos. We had a deal. It's over. That's it. As you wish. If you want to get out of this country safely, you may still need Samos. Without me, you may run into big trouble. -But I'm not refusing your help. -You're right. Can I tell you a little secret? Go ahead. I have a feeling you hid your stash somewhere and are taking off with it tomorrow. -Aren't you overthinking this? -You're not thinking enough. Suppose some well-informed thugs steal your money. It would be too easy. You're a real mother hen. You worry about everything. Come on, split it 50/50 and you can be on your way. You're wasting your time, Samos. You underestimate me. Come on, be reasonable. 50/50. I don't like to repeat myself. Me neither. Tell your minions to move. Bye! OK, he's had enough. I'm happy to see you've found your strength again, Boss. I have to say, I'm pretty happy too. Tie him up. It's time to visit Mustafa again. You're going to tear every millimeter of that room apart, you hear me? If you tell me you didn't find anything, I'm going to take it very badly. I've thought about it. I think I know where he hid the money. Yeah? Where at? We'd rather surprise you. It won't take long. Come, Ralph. Where you go, I will follow. Wake up, lazybones. Here, clean yourself up. You know, had you been reasonable, half of this would still be yours. But Samos is a nice guy. For your room… for your cigarettes… and aspirin in case you have a headache. Your little cruise is on me. You wanted to travel? Well, Samos is paying for your trip. We will meet again, Samos. For your sake, I hope not. If some day you're unwise enough to come back, a word of advice: Leave my staff alone. The girls here are serious and never go out with tourists. Wrap it up. Listen to me carefully. If you ever put on your little act again, I'll hit you so hard you'll have a halo like Saint Peter, OK? What are we waiting for? A package from Samos. Ah, another one! You got a problem with that? No. You can start raising the anchor. -They're here. -OK. Hey, asshole! You can command the troops, the chicken has flown the coop. We won't be taking him to the islands tonight. Are the cars ready? I had the oil changed in the Chevrolet. -Luigi and Ralph took the DeSoto. -Very good. Shouldn't they be there already? Nikos had to get an old bottle of wine from Smyrna out of the ship's hold. That could be. What do you think of this one? You didn't do me any favors, did you? You really threw some punches! Colleauges make good friends. There you go. You knew I would find you. Why did you do that to me? -I'd had enough. -Of who? Monique? No. -Of me? -Are you crazy? Then what? Of everyday life. Of selling cars. -Everything cars. -You have to earn a living. Always giving the same spiel isn't fun. -Do you like our job? -Not really. But admit it's no reason for you to take off with my money. -I wasn't thinking. -You're telling me. I was fascinated by all that money. I thought I could take on the world with it. Buy everything. Even happiness? Poor fool. You wouldn't have been tempted? No, I would have thought of my friend! Am I a jerk? No, but you've had some serious lapses in judgement. And you've hit your max in the past 48 hours. Let's recap: There's Samos, the boss at "Pigalle,"… Apolline. Why Apolline? Why not? You've always been a sucker for a pretty lady. And this one was in on it, I'm sure. I'm sure that she wasn't. Leave her out of it! Easy, now. From here on out, I'm in charge. First, I think Apolline and I have some things to discuss. You stay put. I have a feeling nowhere in Istanbul is safe for you. I'm going to try to sleep. That's right, get some sleep. If you need aspirin, it's in the drawer. Thanks. Samos already has me covered. I'll be damned, that guy thinks of everything. OK, good night. Come, it's time to understand That every moment is the same In the hourglass of life But if we leave together One second will have its moment So, what's the point in hesitating? So, what's the point in waiting? True love is on the way Let's hurry, it will not wait True love has arrived… -A scotch! -Which one? -Have any Crow? -Yes, sir. Great! A double, no ice. Let's hurry, it will not wait True love has arrived True love has arrived True love has arrived I'm beat. There aren't many people tonight. I don't feel like singing again. -A little champagne? -No, thanks. No, I just don't feel well. Maybe you're overworked? You've been taking your job too seriously lately. Be careful, customers are often ungrateful. Well, I feel great! You have been going to bed late recently. And maybe you've been getting up too early? No, not especially. I know something that will make you happy. -You wanted to see my house in Greece. -Yes. Since you're tired, I'm going to take you. A change of scenery. Are you happy? -Delighted. -I did a very good deal. You can never have too much fun. -When are we leaving? -The day after tomorrow. I need to choose a few more girls for the show, then we'll go relax. I hope my dresses will be ready. I have an appointment with my seamstress tomorrow. That's right, make yourself beautiful for me. You won't regret it. Can I go? -You're not going to wait for me? -Listen, Yanni, I'm really exhausted. Then I won't insist. Thank you. You're a nice boy when you want to be. And you're a lovely girl when you want to be. Take Apolline home, then come right back. -I may need you. -Got it, Boss. -May I? -If it will make you happy. It makes me sad, seeing a man alone at 3:00 a.m. My big baby. Excuse me, it's time for my bottle. Why don't you pay attention, you stupid-- Oh, save your breath. You're going to need it. What do you want with me? Are you crazy? Hey, take it easy. If you bite, I'll bite too. Come on. Let me go or my friend will make you regret it. Who's your friend? Is it Samos? -I asked you a question. Is it Samos? -Yes. -Does Grégoire Varèze sound familiar? -Not at all. I'm going to introduce you. We have some things to discuss. Get in. Don't be afraid, you're definitely not my type. -Where are you taking me? -To confess! Oh, it's you! What are you doing here? Ask this man. Do you know him? Yes, he's my babysitter. Well done… You have great connections. Oh, that's enough you two. You can talk later. First, have a seat. Now, try to get your thoughts straight. I forbid you to speak to Apolline like that. You, listen to me carefully. Our conversation earlier was fun. A little friendly appetizer. Do you really want me to get angry? No, but she's a nice girl. Her situation with Samos is a misunderstanding. Then let me question her, without any misunderstandings, and we'll see. Go ahead, but do it tactfully, if you can. That will depend on her. I have nothing to say to you. You look like a gorilla. Not everyone can be attractive. As for you, thanks for your help! Just answer him, Apolline. Believe me, it's in our best interest. Very well, I'm listening. First, my sweet, innocent child, let's get one thing straight right away. If I roughed up your chauffeur and pushed you around to get you here, it's not to play hopscotch. It's because your friend Samos stole 1 million francs from us. -Were you involved? -Involved? No. -See. -You, shut it. -So you don't know anything? -No. And Samos didn't send you to sniff out the big bucks by chance? I didn't know Grégoire was so rich, and he's the one who asked to speak to Samos. I didn't ask him to. If you had asked your friend here, who is being strangely quiet, he would have told you I've had it with Samos. I was hoping he would get me out of this. But judging by his behavior today… Let us not judge recklessly, says the Gospel! -So, you weren't in on it? -I already told you. Be careful, if you betray us, we'll find you! If you only knew how much you remind me of Samos. You're from the same family of vultures! I told you, she'll give it to you straight. Samos and I don't see eye to eye, baby girl. You'll see soon enough. If you want us to get you out of this, you better tell us everything you know. It's our money, Apolline. I stole it from Vincent, and now it's gone. He wants it back, so I can't stop him from questioning you. I never doubted you. Well, there you go. You couldn't have said that earlier? Hey, can we stay on track here? We're listening. So, what do you know? Samos claims he closed a good deal. We leave for Greece the day after tomorrow. To hide our money? Well done. You've finally joined us! Where exactly is he going? -I don't know. -I thought you wanted to help. I'm telling you, I don't know. I'll give you the details tomorrow. Be at "Louise de Paris," my seamstress's, at 4:00 p.m. Boulevard Gümüssuyu. -Will you remember? -Yes. I have a fitting, and Samos never comes. We'll be there. Hey, and be careful! If you have any hesitations, you're right, I am like Samos. I get carried away. Ah, Samos, that's right! Rip my dress. -Are you crazy? -Yes, rip my dress. It'll look more realistic. I was attacked by this crazy man, I fought and I escaped. Go on. Hey, I thought she didn't know how to lie. -To others. -That's what all the suckers say. You're not going to start ranting again, are you? -See you tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. -OK. What do you think of her? I wouldn't like to be in her shoes. -We thought you were dead. -As you can see, I got away. A lucky break. What did this guy want? Youri said he had never seen him. Youri hadn't… but I had. He had hassled me other times before. He always wanted to dance with me. He even offered to take me away for the weekend, but I refused. -You should have told me. -You know, this isn't the first time. It's never been this bad. Did you see what he did to Youri? When he was finished with Youri, he tried to drag me into his car. You didn't have much chance of getting away. Oh, you know how it is in those situations. I screamed, I bit him. I got the attention of passers-by. He was forced to let go. I've always said you were a resourceful girl. I ran. And you got away? He's a foreigner. I know Istanbul better than he does. That's true, but you took a while to get back. I couldn't find a taxi. I had to walk back. Bad luck, because Istanbul is full of taxis. Well, what matters is that you're here. Are you expecting anyone? Boss, we looked for him for half the night. And? I'm listening. A stupid accident between a truck and motorcycle. With the oil on the ground, he had time to get out of the car. You're not in great shape, guys, but there's no time to waste. We've got two guys after us now. Do you think it was a customer who got me? The story about the fanatic, I'm not buying it. Maybe Apolline is telling the truth, maybe she's not. If she's betrayed us, she'll lead us to them. -So, we're not leaving anymore? -We are. Priority number one is the money. Two is to hide it in Monemvasia. Those guys are loaded. We'll be hearing from them soon. So, what do we do, Boss? I'll explain everything. The first thing we're going to do… I don't think we go to enough fashion shows. -I thought you were in love with Apolline. -I can still appreciate beauty. Anyhow, I don't like brunettes. They drive me crazy. Gin Fizz… Of course, you don't like blondes either, do you? Girls are the last thing on my mind right now. Jiggy… I can tell. I'm thinking about my money. Mit souko… Hey, there she is. -I'll meet you in the fitting room. -Very good. -I don't have long. Youri is downstairs. -OK, have a seat. Do you know where Samos hid the cash? In his safe, but there's no use in breaking in. His office has an armored door. -When does he head to Greece? -Tomorrow, but you never know with him. Is he really going to Greece? I won't know until we get there. Well, I'll give you our phone number. Call us as soon as you can. Tell us where you are and we'll be there. Timeless air… -I'll do everything I can. -Thanks. Good luck, Apolline. I'll be relieved once we get her out of there. She seems to like you. Unless she thinks we're jerks, we just wait for her call. Pretty lady… -Are you happy with your trip? -It's wonderful. See that over there? It's the old city of Argos. It has a citadel with cyclopean foundations. Later I'll show you Sparta, the temple of Lycurgus, and the portico of the Persians. You're really interested in old rocks? My sweet Apolline, I think you judged me a bit too narrowly. It has an impact our relationship. Yanni, I never mistook you for what you think I did. It doesn't matter. After this trip, things will be clear between us. Look around, idiot, it's beautiful! Mr. Samos, I've been expecting you. If you'll follow me. I thought this table would do. Perfect, thank you. Ouzo for everyone and oretiko as usual. Very good. Do you mind if I freshen up? Go ahead, darling. You know I like it when you look beautiful. Come on guys, let's sit down. She just asked Maroussia to get her 22-25-10 in Istanbul. Very good, thank you. Go get her. What will you do with her, Boss? Nothing… I'm just going to tell her to invite her friends to our little country house. -Understood, Boss. -No, you haven't understood anything. You never understand, which is precisely why I pay you. The lines are very busy at this time. You can try later. Oh, Yanni, let me explain. Have a seat. Let's drink first. It'd be a shame to not take advantage of the ouzo. You don't want me to explain? There's nothing to explain. The bastard! Yes, that's him, Boss. And she's smiling at him. Calm down, Youri. You'll have another chance to speak to the fellow, because Apolline is going to introduce us to her new friends, right? Listen, Yanni… Get up. Follow me! Gentlemen, if you're hungry, you're in for a treat. I escaped their watch. Samos has the money. Make it quick. It's the last house in the village. In Monemvasia. I'll try to help you. We're on our way. You're a champ. Don't be reckless. Wait for us to do anything. We'll make your boys dance the jerk. Funny. What they don't know is I'll be hosting the party. She's a great girl, like I told you. We'll see! When there's a woman on the job, I always bring extra supplies. Where did you get this? At a White Fathers of Istanbul charity auction. Give me your suitcase. Imagine that, while you were showing off for Apolline, I was taking care of business. It's nice gear. Does it remind you of anything? Yeah, an exposed trench and a bullet in the shoulder. That's why this time, I plan to have all my ducks in a row. Monemvasia, Greece. Have you heard of it? No, but we should be able to find it on the map. You ready? -Yeah. -Let's get going. Well, we're completely lost. Hey, the map isn't detailed enough. These roads aren't on it. Well done. You're not much of a navigator, are you? Driving is more my thing. I know, but I'd like the car to make it there. And preferably not a week from now. Say, are you concerned about Apolline or my money? Both. Let's go this way, then we'll see. Oh, there's nothing to worry about. Like you said earlier, driving is my specialty. The engine is yours. You think so? You see, it's the hose that's messed up. Well, good thing you're handy. You shouldn't make fun. It's a classic breakdown. Now we're stuck here. Moral of the story: It's better to sell cars than rent them. Aren't you funny? Look, we're about to have company. I've always been fascinated by gypsies. Then you're going to love this, because we're going to be stuck with them. Here comes the vanguard. No pushing! Yes, hello. -Some space! -There. Oh, my. -Are you done yet? -There are none left. There are none left. Go on, you dirty kids! I said go on. Hello. Hey, come see this. It's kaput! Engine not good. Car not good. Horse good. Good! Follow me. -Shall we? -What do we have to lose? We have everything here. It's Ali Baba's treasure. In our village we say, he who goes too fast stumbles. Ah! What do you say to that? I prefer to suffer in silence. We have what you need. Here you are! How many do you need? Just one. That one there. -That should work. -It should. How much? Two thousand. He wants 2,000 drachmas. -No, how about 500? -2,000. No, 500. Two thousand. You can have it for 2,000. Go on, give him a drachma. OK. Thanks again. Goodbye. Come to Paris. I'll hire you as a salesman. Goodbye. Have a nice trip! Bye, now. Bye! Good luck! Have a nice trip! Do you think the mirror is really necessary? Yes, it's to see if we're expected. Either they're hiding or still asleep. Let's go down and see. It looks quiet. A little too quiet. Stay 10 meters back and cover me. Well done, Apolline, eh? -As you can see, we weren't expected. -That bitch! I prefer it this way. Now we know where we stand. -What do we do now? -Now, we get them. -Again with the trench. -Oh, shut up! I'm not staying here. We'll be shot like sitting ducks. Follow me. -They chose the wrong place to hide. -I'm sure they will come out soon. As soon as they show their faces, we'll shoot them like rabbits. Come, we're about to have some fun. Hey! We need to get out of here. So do these brave animals. Open the door. This is how they do it in the westerns. You take care of him. He can't tell us where Samos is either! That will be another souvenir. -May I? -Go ahead! -Let's save it. It could come in handy. -Would you quit messing around? Now, there's just one more before we get to Samos. -You think so? -Let's go. We couldn't help it. It's Samos' typical parade of blood and death. Where is he? He protects himself with the lives of others. Tell us where he is. He had my husband Andréas killed. Samos left and drug the French girl with him. She yelled and fought. They threw her into the car like barbarians. -How many were there? -Three. The girl, Samos, and his driver Youri. -You know where they are? -They're at Nikos's cove. Take me and I'll show you. Shit, border control. Put the rubber out to sea. Samos can wait. I think we've won this time, Boss. Go on, get out, and I suggest you keep quiet. Once on board, we'll settle things between us for good. You don't scare me anymore, Samos. Come on, let's go. I don't see Nikos's boat. This is it. We have to walk from here. Over there. What can he be doing? Leave her to me. She's too easy, Samos. You deserve a better opponent. I'll let you have him. Enjoy! I've met the other one before. One arm will be enough. Go ahead. He's yours. Now, it's your turn to die, Samos. Do you mind? THE END Subtitle translation by: Emily Moorlach
