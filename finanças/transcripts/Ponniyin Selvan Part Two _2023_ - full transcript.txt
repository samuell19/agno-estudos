O Lord of Bountiful Rain Do not hold back Dive into the ocean Take Your fill and soar to the sky Let Your body turn dark like the king of the universe Held in Padmanabha’s embrace May you dazzle like lightning May your thunder echo like his sacred conch Charge! Fly like a hail of arrows from his sacred bow Moisten the world with abundant rainfall Let us celebrate The great Karikalan has been defeated. Are you the priest’s daughter? No. I am the Goddess’s daughter. Will you come with me to the palace, to be my friend? I need to offer flowers to the Goddess. Recite prayers. Prepare food. At night, I must lock the temple doors. It is the princess who invites you, Nandini. Go with her. Come, Princess. Princess, your new friend is very pretty. She will look a princess if she wore jewellery. Let us name her "Princess of the Temple Pond." Her beauty makes you jealous. Prince Aditha Karikalan is coming. Kundavai! Who is this princess? Forgive her. She is an orphan. Nandini ran, out of fear. I hope nothing is missing. She shall not enter the palace again. I shall see to it. Nandini! Stop! Competing with my horse? The horse may belong to you, but these woods belong to me. -Someone might see us. -Let them. -I'm not supposed to talk to you. -On whose orders? The princess. Kundavai? Why? I am an orphan. No one knows my family background. I leave for Thanjavur today. The emperor’s orders. I shall accompany him to war. To war? At your age? I may not return for a year or two. O beautiful flower Will you not garland him, O friend? O royal warrior, O brave and strong one Invincible Chola warrior May your world prosper. Hail to your victory Those who dare oppose you, you send to their graves O angel of undying love Lovely damsels yearn for you We sing your glory, O brave one A dagger at your waist Carrying the world on your shoulders Come, rule my heart Board your ship Enter the battlefield like a thousand charging elephants O lord, king of kings, come Hail to your victory! O royal warrior, O brave and strong one Royal maidens sing Women dance Singers sing in celebration. Horse chariots move in harmony Like the rising sun over dappled waters, you shine, O lord When singing praises of your army, poets struggle for want of words Like the blustery wind skimming the sea, your ships speed across choppy waters Blowy waves caress you. Charge south, O valiant warrior O royal warrior, O brave and strong one The people of Aruva Nadu obey his commands O defeater of the Northerners The countrymen of Kudaku Nadu bow to his might. Destroyer of the Pandyan might O young moon Why is there this distance between us? When harsh winds blow, my love How can the strongest flame hope to burn? The stars no longer shine for me Blood no longer runs in my veins I feel the kingdom crumble, my love What meaning is left in life? Where do I look for you, my love? What path shall I take? Misfortune holds me in its grip, my love Engulfing me in perilous darkness Where is your spirited dance? Where are your honeyed words? Where is your mischievous smile? Where is your beautiful form? Where are those hands, soothing as soft clouds? The future empress of Thanjavur. Where are those searching eyes, as warm as dawn’s rays? O young moon Why is there this distance between us? Harsh winds are blowing, my love How can the strongest flame hope to burn? Have mercy on us. We will leave this kingdom. Do not torment us. I feel the universe slip through my fingers The sky splits asunder, my love The world crumbles before me You left me in asmouldering fire How could you leave me? What wrong did I do? The curse of separation was your parting gift Nandini! "PONNIYIN SELVAN - PART 2" In the year 968 AD, the Chola Empire faced many conspiracies, political unrest and impending war. King Khottiga of the Rashtrakutas was gathering a huge army to attack Thanjavur. To avenge the death of King Veera Pandiyan, Pandyan assassins infiltrated the Chola kingdom. Sundara Chozhar's uncle, Gandarathidar's son, Madhuranthakan, against his father's wishes and his mother's orders, was determined to claim the Chola throne. The Chola treasurer, the brave warrior, Periya Pazhuvettarayar and the chieftains backed Madhuranthakan's claim to the crown. While Periya Pazhuvettarayar's wife, Nandini, conspired with the Pandyan rebels against the Chola kingdom. She also tricked Arunmozhi's father, the emperor, to pass an order to capture Prince Arunmozhi and bring him back from Lanka. But the Chola prison ship that was carrying Arunmozhi was caught in a perilous storm and sank. Learning of Arunmozhi's death, the Cholas were angered and shocked. Believing Nandini was behind the plot to have Arunmozhi killed, his elder brother Aditha Karikalan became enraged and so led his army to Thanjavur. Kodiyakkarai You Pandyans! Pay me for damaging my boat! How can you go without paying me? The young Chola tiger has drowned at sea. Pandyan fish have feasted on him. The Chola tiger has fallen into the sea. Stop talking, Devaralan! We got him. -Did you see the prince die? -I saw him drowning with my own eyes. -Did you see his lifeless body? -I saw a fire raging in all directions. There was a devastating storm. -You fool! -Ravidasan, what happened? We did not see his corpse. Until we do, our thirst for revenge will not end. The flames of our fire still burn strong. Where is the Pazhuvur Queen, Nandini? She is with her old man near the lighthouse. There are soldiers everywhere. They keep watch on the shore. Rakamma, there’s no need to search. The young tiger is no more. Rakamma, go to the Pazhuvur Queen Nandini. Tell her I wish to see her now. I see a Pallava flag. I hear Parthibendran was in Lanka. Could that be him? He must’ve saved Arunmozhi. Arunmozhi is coming! Parthibendran! Where is Arunmozhi? I hope no harm has come to him. Don’t pretend! It was you who wanted him dead. How dare you! Didn’t you send a ship to imprison Arunmozhi? He drowned at sea and the ship sank. Arunmozhi was the child I raised. I had hoped he managed to swim ashore. He’s not a man to die that easily. Who ordered you to sail to Lanka? You have killed Arunmozhi. Tie the traitor up! You are like a grandfather to Karikalan. Tie me up yourself. No one else would dare! Who is he? Salutations to the Pazhuvur Queen. I am the Pallava King, Parthibendran. Not just any Parthibendran! He’s the beheader of Veera Pandiyan. Only Aditha Karikalan can make that claim. I am his friend. Why talk about that now? Where is Arunmozhi? Is he not on your ship? I am a king. I do not lie. The lies that kings speak are called politics. We must inspect his ship. -I will inspect it. -Brother, let me accompany you. Make sure the Pallavan king does not escape. I shall watch over him. Your old man suspects me without reason. Did I start the storm at sea? How can I be blamed for Arunmozhi’s death? You will not be blamed, but I shall be. As usual they will all say: “After all, she enchanted an old man to grab the Chola throne.” No one will say such a thing. There is one person who will. Who? Princess Kundavai. See, you went silent when I mentioned her name. After all, she’s a Chola princess, and a great beauty. Her beauty cannot match the beauty of your little toe. You say that now, but wait till you see her. That is not my nature. I am… Can you do something for me? Anything. We must save the Chola kingdom from a murderous family strife. How? There is one way. And only you can do it. What must I do? Will you do as I say? If you asked me, I’d give my kingdom to you. Is that true? Salutations to Lord Shiva. The Blue Lord, the Immortal. O Lord of the Universe. In the name of Lord Shiva. Here, Lord Shiva has shown us Kalamugars a new path. The great Shiva devotee and peerless son of Gandarathidar, the Chola Prince Madhuranthakan is here to see us. Hara Hara Mahadeva! We have news from Kodiyakkarai. The sea has swallowed Arunmozhi. -Shivoham! -Praise to Lord Shiva. -Now the next in line is... -Madhuranthakan Devar. Madhuranthakan Devar! You have the support of 50,000 warmongering Kalamugars. Hara Hara Mahadeva! Shivoham! Shivoham! My prince, my name is Ugradevan. I am the Rashtrakuta King Khottiga’s Commander. His nephew, Karkan is here with a message. The Rashtrakutas are the Cholas’ enemies. Not anymore. Now our enemy is Karikalan. You cannot defeat Karikalan alone, but united we can. You want me to join you, the Cholas’ enemies, and betray my kingdom? The enemy of an enemy is a friend. Shivoham! You need not betray your kingdom, just become our ally. We shall make you the next Chola emperor. In King Khottiga's name, I give you my word. As proof, here is… King Khottiga’s daughter, Maathuli. If you became our king’s son-in-law, it would fill us with pride. United, we can conquer the Himalayas. If this alliance can be forged, it will be the king’s responsibility to make you the Chola emperor, without bloodshed. If Madhuranthakan Devar agrees, then let us know. Our forces will be ready to stand by you. Shivoham! Prince. You are fine, my prince. Open your eyes. Prince, we are nearing shore. Prince, it will not be long. Prince, stay with me. Poonguzhali, look! A boat is approaching. -Whose boat goes there? -I saw it from the lighthouse. I saw Poonguzhali's boat on the canal. That means Prince Ponniyin Selvan... Pull the boat towards us. Poonguzhali... Poonguzhali There’s no one in it. Nambi, is that you? -Where is the prince? -Poonguzhali, move the sails. -Scoundrel! Did you kill the prince? -Hush! The prince is here. He is unwell. He needs a physician. -He's alive! -What happened? -Ponniyin Selvan is alive. -Hush! Now the Chola kingdom will be saved. -How did you get here? -I came with Parthibendran. Then I followed Sendhan. I must inform the Prime Minister. Stay calm. The prince needs a physician first. -His fever is dangerous. -No one must know he's here. Let us take him to the monastery at Nagapattinam. The Buddhist monks will heal him. -The shoreline is swarming with soldiers. -Who goes there? Nambi, get into this boat. Hurry! You head to Nagapattinam. I shall handle them. Who goes there? Ah! Ravidasan! Is that you? How is the family? Were the rains plentiful in your village this year? How did you get here? I fell into the sea and swam all the way here. I was hungry. So I climbed a tree, looking for an owl's or a crow's egg. But the tree branch snapped. Sorcerer, can you find me a pigeon’s egg? Hey! Where is Arunmozhi? I am Arunmozhi. Here’s my Signet Ring. Oh no! It was lost at sea. You're the sorcerer, aren't you? No. We are the Lords of Death. Take us to Arunmozhi. Or else you cannot pass. Devaralan, a watery grave was predicted for me. So let us talk on land. Make way. Come closer. Let us settle it right here. Let me pass! Thambi! Do not row so fast. Don't you see my boat? No, I can't. -Slow down. Mind my boat. -Let me pass! You madman! Stop. Choodamani Viharam, Nagapattinam Kurakkuthurai Parthibendran, just tell me Arunmozhi is alive and well. I refuse to hear anything else. Wishing alone changes nothing. Did you see it with your own eyes? -Did you? -Yes. He drowned at sea. Vanthiyathevan drowned with him. I thought you’d bring me good news. I was foolish to think that. It was your news that I awaited. I was helpless. Arunmozhi refused to listen to me. He ignored your orders too. Tell me, Parthibendran, who is behind this? Is it her doing? Was it that Pazhuvur snake? Tell me. No. The Pandyan rebels are responsible. They have some connection. The Pandyan rebels are active in the Chola kingdom, thanks to her. Hate has blinded you. You have changed. Tell me the truth. Did you see her? Aditha, the Chola kingdom is endangered. Only you can save the emperor and the Chola people. Leave it to me. Tomorrow my army will march to Thanjavur. That’s unwise. People will think you’re challenging your father. Madhuranthakan has an army too. If he challenges you, civil war will follow. "The kingdom will be destroyed." That is what Nandini asked me to tell you. So, you did see her. What else did she say? Aditha, you are the future of the Cholas. To save the kingdom, Nandini Devi bids you to come to Kadambur. To Kadambur? The den of conspiracies? So, you are her messenger now? Has that snake seduced you too? Coiled around your heart? Aditha, I am your loyal friend. We've fought side by side, and will do so again. For your own sake and the future of your kingdom, come with me. Parthibendran, what were her exact words? She said you were bound to come if she invited you. You still have the Tiger Signet Ring Aditha Karikalan gave you years ago. He charmed you. Then he left you and went to war. You were driven out like a stray dog. Remember? What are you implying? You think I could waver if I saw him again? The Tiger Signet Ring was locked away till now. Today it is in your hand. Mind your tongue! You were an orphan, living on the streets. Many preyed on your beauty. But Veera Pandiyan protected you. He considered you like a daughter. Never forget that. -I will not survive. -Who dares to say that? I will not give up hope. I will save you somehow. Nandini. Will you promise me something? Command me. My son, Amarabujanga, raise him as your brother. Will you? You will be there to crown Amarabujanga the Pandyan king. My son. Ravidasan. The man who abandoned you did not spare Veera Pandiyan. Nandini. I beg you. Spare his life. No! Vasuki, I have forgotten nothing. Thirumaraikadu Have you forgotten me? My prince, how could I? Should we not avenge your father’s murder? Yes, we will. Their heads will roll. We will destroy the Chola clan, Amarabujanga. Hear me, Veera Pandiyan’s bodyguards! Our great enemy, Karikalan, must have heard that Arunmozhi has drowned. He must be charging towards us like a mad elephant. This poisonous sword will fell that mad elephant. To cremate his firstborn, Sundara Chozhar will rush out of his palace without bodyguards. That will be our chance to behead the emperor. If Arunmozhi still lives, when he hears his brother and father have been slain, he’ll come out of hiding. Only to be sacrificed by the Pandyans. Ravidasan! Your plan will fail. You did not manage to kill Arunmozhi in Lanka. Remember you failed many times. Karikalan is far stronger than Arunmozhi. It will be impossible to even near that mad elephant. If we manage to kill one of the three, the other two will be under close guard. The entire Thanjavur army will start looking for us on land and in forest. They will hunt us. Karikalan will die at my hands in Kadambur. That is certain. How can we be sure that Karikalan will come to Kadambur? It is I who has invited him. There is only one way to fulfil our oath. On the next full moon we must kill all three tigers around the same time. Each one, unaware of the death of the other, should be assassinated. We shall fulfil the oath we took over Veera Pandiyan’s lifeless body. Hail to the Emperor Veera Pandiyan! The Chola clan will be destroyed. Devi? Is that you? Answer me truthfully. Then you may return to Vallam with your head intact. Devi, when I left Vallam I did not promise my mother I’d return with my head. So what if I lost it? You know where Arunmozhi is hiding. If you do not tell me, you’ll die a dishonourable death. And if I tell you, I will not live an honourable life. Arunmozhi lives. I know where he is, but I cannot tell you. Though I know a secret concerning you. If you wish, I can tell you. What secret? This is no way to share secrets. Ask your men to go. Amarabujanga, the sword. That scoundrel Ravidasan hit me so hard. In Thanjavur, you are the Pazhuvur Queen. In these woods, you are the Pandyan Queen. Where else do you reign? What secret did you mean? I saw a lady who looked just like you. She could be your mother. Her hair was long and grey. She came like a guardian angel, astride an elephant. You lie! There's something else. She was mute. Where was this? Where did you see her? If I answered that, it would be inviting instant death. I’m no fool. You must guarantee my safe passage. Your men must not follow me. I promise you, I swear on this sword, we shall not kill you. Thank the Lord! My head is saved. A head is very important, Devi. Can you cut the rope ever so gently? No need for that, Devi. Vallavarayan from the Vanar clan lives up to his word. Tell me. Where did you see my mother? In Lanka. She lives like a queen of the forest. She looks just like you. The very image of you. On her face, there is no trace of anger, or feelings of revenge. Only the compassion of a mother. Even when you cry, beauty shows. You are the only man to have seen my tears, Vallavarayan. If you see my mother again, bring her to me. Ravidasan, let him go. Oh God! I feel a ghost around me. O Goddess Kali, if I take Your name, the ghost will disappear. -Hara Hara Mahadeva! -There, I see it! -I see the ghost. -Hara Hara Mahadeva! Who are you? I am Kalamugan. I have come to sacrifice you. -Hey, Nambi. -Ayyo! Untie me first, then sacrifice me. How did you recognise me? Before you appeared, your belly did. What brings you here? I came to save you. I’m surprised they did not sacrifice you to Goddess Kali. Ravidasan hit you so hard, I thought you'd be lying at the Lord of Death’s doorstep. He did hit me hard. But I’m a better actor than you. I overheard every word they were saying. Go to Aditha Karikalan, and I’ll warn Princess Kundavai. A beard? Your new disguise? Hurry! How did he know it was me? Shivoham! Shivoham! Pazhayarai We won't leave until you answer us. What happened to Ponniyin Selvan? -Where is our prince? -Did he die? Make way! Shivoham! Shivoham! Shivoham! Shivoham! Is that really my son, Madhuranthakan? Where is my mother, Queen Sembiyan Mahadevi? She sent me a warm invitation, so I came with my friends. Where is my mother? Did she leave anything for her beloved son? A crown? Or prayer beads? Ask her to present them to me in front of my friends. -Why did she call me here? -Uncle, is it true you’ve raised an army to oppose the emperor? They are Lord Shiva's devotees. They obey only the orders of their Lord. What are their Lord’s orders? To seek truth and claim rights. Are their orders to oppose the emperor, destroy the kingdom? Are those the rights you claim? Do you plan to marry Khottiga’s daughter? So you can seize the Chola throne? The throne is mine. It was on loan to the emperor. I claim it back now. -Tie the spy up. -I have a secret message. I’m no spy. Only spies carry secret messages. When your father was ailing, and your brothers left for war, who governed the kingdom? Unseen, I governed it. Now I’ll govern it in full sight. This throne is mine. Shivoham! Shivoham! Hail the Shiva devotee Madhuranthakan! I am Aditha Karikalan’s friend and Arunmozhi Devar’s messenger. The princess is waiting for me. Untie me. And yes! I know Pazhuvettarayar, too. I have the Signet Ring that Nandini Devi gave me. I've completed the mission the princess entrusted me with. I must see her at once. You fools! I bring good news. Take me to your princess. Who is that? Come. Thank God, there's at least one man here. Untie me. Even blindfolded, I can kill you. Who are you? Where is Arunmozhi? Did they send a woman? Why should I tell you? Don’t you value your head? No. You won’t behead me. Why not? Because I have an important message for your princess. What message? I will give it only to her. Who are you? The princess sent me here. Really? What did she say? She said: “Slay the spy”. Did she not see me? Or recognise me? No. She must have forgotten who you are. Probably. I’m just a humble soldier. And she’s the emperor’s daughter. -Besides… -Besides? I hear she is soon to marry Parthibendran. So? What is it to you? Nothing really. After all, who am I? I don’t even rule over a small patch of land. How could I desire…? What did you desire? Many things. Who told you the princess is marrying Parthibendran? So, is she not marrying him? Really? Why not? Someone else fills her mind. He promised the princess something but he has forgotten. The promise was kept. The prince I was supposed to bring back is safe and well. Those were the orders. Thank you for following them. But what about the promise? What promise? About his life belonging to her and not to him. When my heart breaks into a smile, my face smiles too When my face breaks into a smile, flowers smile too When flowers break into a smile, trees smile too When trees break into a smile, buds smile too Who can it be? Who weaves this garland of smiles? Who is in everything? Who has tied my heart to everything around me? O distant waterfalls, lovely as nature’s gait O tall trees, holding up those sky umbrellas Thirumalai. Prince, by the time my horse and I got here, the dawn had broken. We’re out of breath. I bring good news. For your ears only. That’s why I did not enter the camp. -Have you news of my brother? -Yes, my prince. You must come with me to the monastery in Nagapattinam. My prince. -Thirumalai. -My prince! Thirumalai… -Prince... -No, no. Choodamani Viharam, Nagapattinam I grew up with two warrior princes. I should not cry. So make me laugh. When I was away, did you find yourself a young man, my sister? Stop! Vanthiyathevan said… Is he the one? -Do not joke! Vanthiyathevan told me… -So, it must be him! Let it go. A mute woman saved you from drowning. Who was she, Arunmozhi? Nandini. What are you saying? This isn’t the first time that she has saved my life. She saved me when I fell into the River Kaveri. -Nandini? -Yes. She looked just like Nandini. But she had long grey hair. It was not Nandini. It was an old woman resembling her. Vanthiyathevan thought so too. But how? How is this possible? Why would she save your life, like a caring mother? -Hey, tuft of hair! Where to? -How did you recognise me? The smell of tamarind rice gave you away. Why are you here? I came to pray to Buddha. You too? How will you pray if I chopped off your limbs? Such violent talk in a Buddhist monastery! You said you’d bring Karikalan here, instead, you show up as a monk. Do you believe all Buddhist monks are Buddhist monks? I almost died. Now I feel reborn. I could not imagine this world without you. I nearly lost my mind. Did you think I would leave you so easily? I intend to cause more trouble for you. Get well first. I cannot stay long. If I was followed, they’ll know you’re here. I must leave now and return soon. Brother, I know you’re going to Kadambur, but you must not. All right. -We'll ask them to come to Thanjavur. -Very well, I won’t go. Satisfied? You’re going there to meet Nandini. Why must you see her? I must know what she wants from me. She can take everything I have. Brother, do not speak to her when you still feel bitter. Let me talk to them. There’s no need for you both to protect me. All this started because of me. I must end it alone. Wait. Vallavarayan! -Prince! -It’s been ages since I last saw you. Salutations, my prince. You’ve fulfilled your task, friend. Now I can admit the Vanar Clan has brave warriors. Thank you, prince. Tell my brother what you know. I overheard the Pandyan rebels talking in the forest. They swore to kill three Chola tigers around the same time. Two days from now, on the next full moon. Under Nandini’s guidance. That’s why you’ve been invited to Kadambur. The Pandyan rebels are everywhere. Kundavai, return to Thanjavur. Make sure you have full protection. Vallavarayan, when my brother’s health improves, it's your responsibility to bring him to Thanjavur. Tell him. Prince, allow me to accompany you to Kadambur. We’ll handle Nandini and our foes. Are you coming to protect me? Or to protect Nandini? Prince, protecting you is my duty. My friend, I will not permit you to accompany me. That's an order. Prince! If you ignore my orders, I cannot be responsible for what befalls you. Kadambur The crown prince. The defeater of the Pandyas. Behold the Prince Aditha Karikalan. He approaches! The presence of the prince makes Kadambur glorious again. Why close the gates in such haste? Do you plan to imprison me, too? My Prince! This Fort is not large enough to welcome all your soldiers. My dear friend, Parthibendran Pallavan. Have you switched loyalties? I am always on your side. I myself do not know whose side I am on. People switch sides so often. Then they start their plotting. Oh, great uncle! The Pazhuvur Queen! How are you? Are you well? Great uncle, how did you bring your Queen here? In a covered palanquin? She came astride my elephant. Everyone could see her. That is the proper way. Follow this practice. A spy told me all the Chieftains were conspiring against me. Prince, suspicion seems to cloud your thinking. Why would it? Here is the Pazhuvur Lord. Could I ever think he would act against the Cholas? Am I mad? What do you say, great uncle? Where are the other Chieftains? -They will arrive by sunset. -Good! Let them come. We shall plot together! I love conspiracies. No better place to hatch a plot than in the Kadambur Fort. What do you say, great uncle? Let us in. Let us enter! Who are you hiding? Let us in! Is that Prince Arunmozhi Varman? Hail Prince Arunmozhi! They've imprisoned the prince. These monks have imprisoned the prince. This monastery must not be disgraced because of me. Come! Prince, I saw the Pandyan rebels hidden amongst the crowd. They plan to attack you. Do not go outside. Prince, we can escape through the canal. It leads to Aanaimangalam and then onto Pazhayarai. Are you suggesting I hide and deceive my people? Rulers who do not trust their subjects cannot rule over them. Ponniyin Selvan is indeed here! I sought refuge in this monastery. The monks have healed me. These monks deserve the same respect that we show our sages. Hail Ponniyin Selvan! I must leave for Thanjavur, but I'll return soon. You must repair the damage you've caused this monastery. Return to your homes once you have taken the monks’ blessings. I order it! As you command, Prince. Hail Ponniyin Selvan! The prince must stay and accept the hospitality of the poor. We request you stay another day. Prince, we request you stay. Tomorrow is full moon. Take part in our prayers and seek the Buddha's blessings. It would give us great joy. Prince, do not accept their request... Thambi. Go! Kill him! Monks, move aside! Prince Arunmozhi is our enemy, not you. We do not wish to spill your blood. Move aside. Do you hear the death knell? Aren't you a Pandyan rebel? Look over there. Another Chola prince will die on the elephant. Beware of the mahout’s goad! Catch him! Prince, no! Beware of the mahout! The elephant! The mahout’s goad. Prince! Prince, do not mount the elephant. Look at me. Here! -Prince! -I beg you, look over there. Prince, look at me. Thanjavur Where is he? I dare not say, even to myself. Don’t. Even the walls have ears. It is good if he's well. Father, I came here to ask you a question. I believe Arunmozhi met a mute woman in Lanka. She rode an elephant, like a forest goddess. He said she looked so much like Nandini. Remember when you anointed Karikalan the crown prince? Periya Pazhuvettarayar came to the palace with his wife, an orphan. When you first saw Nandini you were taken aback. You turned pale and your body trembled. You seemed shocked. Later you asked whose daughter she was. I still remember your confused expression. There’s something you know about her. Tell me. What do you wish to know? Who is this mute queen who so resembles Nandini? She died many years ago. I don’t know who you mean. She cannot be dead. She saved Arunmozhi from drowning at sea. She saved him earlier too, when he fell into the River Kaveri. She no longer lives. She drowned at sea. Who is she? A sin I committed. It was the worst act of betrayal I have ever committed. I promised her I would return. Instead, I came here and became emperor. I lost my Mandakini. I lost my silent angel. Should she have been the empress? How could an emperor behave so immorally? If an emperor behaves thus, how can his people be moral? Kundavai, when I was young, I was just like your brother Aditha Karikalan. I was reckless. I was headstrong and impulsive. The Pandyan Navy had attacked my ship. So I sought refuge on an island near Lanka. -An island girl saved my life. -Mandakini? I spent only a few days with her, but she won my heart like none other. Learning my ship was wrecked, another Chola ship came searching for me. Sinner that I am, I held Mandakini’s hand, made her a promise, and boarded the ship. She was on my mind, even after I returned to Thanjavur. I sent my minister, Anirudha, to bring her to me. When he returned, he told me Mandakini had drowned at sea. So, Nandini, who I detested, is the mute queen’s daughter? -And my sister? -What do you mean? Is that the reason you threw Nandini out when Karikalan fell in love with her? No, my child! I always believed you were a true and honourable man. So you are Nandini’s father. -Where are you going? -You're lying. I'll ask someone who does not lie. Kundavai, stop. You know the truth about Nandini, don’t you? Everyone says you never lie. Is the mute queen her mother? And Sundara Chozhar her father? She's my sister, isn’t she? Mandakini should be empress instead of my mother. Kundavai, my sweet girl, you're wrong. Two years after your father became emperor, and married your mother, Mandakini came here. She was pregnant. So how could the emperor have fathered her child? Mandakini left, leaving her baby with the temple priest. Nandini is not your sister. Then who is she? Who is her father? I do not know, Kundavai. But she is not your sister. I promise you. Kadambur Three years ago, my father made me the crown prince. Everyone here approved that decision. Did you not? Now you want me to give the throne to Madhuranthakan? Is that fair, my lord? Am I wrong to refuse? We cannot say Madhuranthakan has no claim to the throne. The Chola kingdom starts at Kanya Kumari and goes north to the Krishna River. My prince, the land south of the River Kollidam will go to Madhuranthakan, and all the rest will belong to you. That will be a fair division. “That will be a fair division.” You want to divide the Chola kingdom? You’ll divide it? Is that what you propose? Dividing the kingdom is like dividing a mother’s heart. Or like sharing a wife? For you old men, it might seem a fair solution, but I will not agree to it. What now? What else are you planning? You’ve already imprisoned the emperor in his own palace. You’ve turned him into a puppet. Did the emperor really wish to imprison Arunmozhi? Or did you force his hand? Great uncle! Believe me. The Chola people are enraged. They hold you responsible for Arunmozhi’s drowning. Prince, who dares to accuse me? I’ll pull out their tongues. I’ll behead those who point fingers. Were you to kill everyone who accused you, the Chola kingdom would turn into a vast burial ground. You speak of justice and rights, while wishing to anoint a man unfit to rule, so you can rule through him. -Why not become emperor instead? -Aditha! Enough! We’re all gathered here today so that we can avoid a civil war. Do not divide this great Chola kingdom in my name. The kingdom belongs to me. It was given to me by my father. If you all desire it, I shall willingly give the throne to Madhuranthakan. Let him rule Thanjavur. But on one condition. My army will stay with me. I will not come to Thanjavur. The lands I capture, north of the River Krishna, will belong to me or my brother, Arunmozhi. -I agree to your proposal. -We all agree. We’ll go together to Thanjavur, inform the emperor then decide. That is not possible. If the emperor commands me otherwise, I am bound to obey him. This must end in Kadambur Palace. Go at once to Thanjavur and bring Madhuranthakan here. Very well. Wait. This time bring him in plain sight, instead of hiding him in Nandini’s palanquin! My God, what a grand fort! -And you live here? -No, I live near the temple. Maybe I should stay here. Come. Come to my house. To your house? Why? To be my wife. And string flower garlands with you? I want jewels, silks and palaces. Can you give me all that? Those things will give you no peace. But I can give you a peaceful life. That kind of peace is realised after death. Poonguzhali, come! Move aside! Isn’t that Ponniyin Selvan’s army? Periya Velaar leads it. -We must hurry. -Why? The Fort gates will close soon. I hear the drums. Come! Come. Don’t look back. Mandakini? What brings her here? Commander Kalanthaka Kandan. Poonguzhali! Is this the secret tunnel? Commander! You coward! Why did you close the Fort gates? We’re here to drive away you traitors. You and your brother. Traitors? You bring your army to attack Sundara Chozhar. You’re the traitor. Mind your tongue! You’re the one who’s holding the emperor prisoner. Madhuranthakan, I warn you. Anyone who opposes Crown Prince Aditha Karikalan is an enemy who we shall slay. Run, if you wish to live. Are you here to attack the emperor? The Chola people will not forgive you. The emperor will decide that. Bring him here. Bring him here or else I will declare war. -I dare you! -I'm warning you. You have till sunset tomorrow. We demand to see the emperor. Or we shall raze this Fort to dust. Your Pazhuvur clan will be destroyed. Be warned! Guards, if they step forward, show them no mercy. Madhuranthakan, where to? I must leave this Fort now. There's nothing for me here. Everything will be decided tonight. Tomorrow you will be crowned. Be patient! It's you who must be patient. Make sure the army does not hang you. I will return to Thanjavur to be crowned. Without bloodshed or warfare, I will rule over the Chola kingdom. This kingdom belongs to Shiva. Shivoham! Shivoham! Can you hear footsteps? The spirits of those who perished in this tunnel roam about here. Be not afraid. Do ghosts and spirits really exist? Yes. And they feed on those who tremble with fear like you. Is this it? Do not panic. Look behind it. Air enters the tunnel through here. The old tiger's room can be seen from this tunnel. Many guard the old tiger. Be patient. This evening they'll go to pray to Goddess Durga. The tiger will be alone. But he’s so well guarded. When hunting a tiger, one must wait patiently before the attack. Vanathi! Make way, move aside! We have a message for the emperor. Make way. The adopted daughter of Kodumbalur Periya Velaar, beloved Vanathi Devi is here. Make way! Vanathi, what brings you here? I have a message for the emperor. Is it about Arunmozhi Varman? What have you heard about him? That he is a great warrior. One cannot drown him in the River Kaveri, nor at sea. Enough! Where is the prince? Tell me. I can only tell the emperor. Move! The emperor’s command. Salutations to the princess! Only the elephant and those riding it may enter. Commander, a message for you. If any harm befalls my niece, your clan will be destroyed. Coward! You want to lay siege so you can crown your niece empress? How dare you! Are your actions an attempt to put me on the throne? Even if I marry Ponniyin Selvan, I will be a wife only. I will not sit on the throne beside him. Foolish girl! Many other women would happily be his queen. Step aside! We must see the emperor. Who are you? Prince, it's you! You frightened us. Hail Arunmozhi Varman! Hail Ponniyin Selvan! Hail Ponniyin Selvan! Tell the emperor the prince is here. Make the arrangements to welcome Ponniyin Selvan. Open the Fort gates and let only the prince enter. -I hope you're all right. -Sure, you are all right? Why this siege? How can you decide who will be the next emperor? Surrender to the Fort Commander. Prince. Commander, will you obey my orders? As you command. Put your weapons down. Poonguzhali, so you’ve abandoned water for land? -Prince! -Is that Sendhan? Thirumalai! Come. After you, prince. -Thirumalai, who is this girl? -Tell him... The emperor is in danger. The Pandyan rebels are inside the Fort. How did they enter? Poonguzhali, tell him. Nandini’s maid led them inside. I saw them as they were taken to her quarters. Guard! Summon the royal guards at once. Girl, come with me. The young tiger is still alive. Our men failed in Nagapattinam. This is our chance to kill them both. -Siriya Velaar’s daughter! -I see, it's Vanathi. -What is that sound? -Nothing. Keep going. Quick. Everyone, go eastward! Who is it? Who is that? Who goes there? Who is there? Who is there? Mandakini. Is that you? Is it really you? You're still alive! Forgive me. I am a sinner. Glory to King Veera Pandiyan! Mandakini! May the glorious Madurai king, Veera Pandiyan, live forever! Young men will no longer sing your praises Women will no longer pluck the strings of your musical instruments The strings lie broken The court singers shall no longer sing for you The symbol of manhood, the slayer of all enemies The wielder of the sharpest sword has fallen from grace So why do you bloom now, O Mullai flower? So why do you bloom now? Young men will no longer sing your praises Women will no longer pluck the strings of your musical instruments The strings lie broken The court singers shall no longer sing for you The symbol of manhood The slayer of all enemies The wielder of the sharpest sword has fallen from grace So why do you bloom now, O Mullai flower? Rashtrakuta Nadu Shivoham! Shivoham! Hail Madhuranthakan Devar! Hail the Shiva devotee Madhuranthakan Devar! At last, our time has come. The Cholas will not rise for another 100 years. Untie me. I know many important secrets. Your Prince Aditha’s life will be in danger tonight. Shut your mouth! Or I’ll pull your tongue out. There is a full moon tonight. Beware! Your prince’s life is in danger… Kollidam River, Kadambur Where is Periya Pazhuvettarayar going? Another conspiracy afoot? If we had our horses, we could follow him and find out what he's plotting. Look over there! What is that? The tunnel that leads to Kadambur palace. No, don’t go. Listen to me. O boat girl, row your boat towards me She spreads her mat, waiting for me Who is this? A boatman. We suspected he was a spy. Are you a Pandyan? I’m a bit Chola, a bit Pandyan, and the rest is Lankan. For gold, I work for anyone. My name is Karuthiruman. Get rid of him! No. I know many secrets. I know where the Pandyan treasures are hidden in Lanka. Let go. Let me go! Shall I tell you another secret? Tonight, death will hover over Karikalan, through Queen Nandini. What did you say? The Pandyan rebels and the Queen have plotted to kill the prince. Drop a rope down for me. Or the truth will drown with me. He's mad, he rants. -Lower the rope ladder. -Veerasena! My lord, I saw them myself and I heard them too. I took the Pandyan rebels to Kadambur in my boat. Tonight they are going to avenge their king's death. Turn the boat around. Hail Veera Pandiyan! The time has come! How many of you are here? Karikalan will most certainly come tonight... Once you kill him, we'll be here to protect you. Ravidasan, wait here. Be patient. Come to me only when I call you. If you hesitate, we'll have to kill him. Anyone who comes in the way will be slain, even you. Ravidasan, if there’s something I cannot do, then it'll certainly be beyond you. Wait here. You? Here? Go away. Give me the Fish Emblem sword, and I will go. You'll find many swords and spears in the hunting lodge. Tell me the truth. You intend to fulfil your oath tonight, don’t you? Devi, do not commit this terrible sin. Are you here to stop me? Very well then. Why don't you stop your friend from coming here instead? Devi, if he knew I was here, he would not spare me. I cannot stop him. That’s why I have come to you. Nandini! Leave it. The prince will have heard the sword falling. He’ll be suspicious if the sword is put away. You must hide. Do not lock the door. Nandini. Was the sword meant to welcome me? Is it not the proper way to welcome brave tigers? I thought you would've forgotten the past. And you? Have you forgotten it? Maybe you cannot forget, but can you not forgive? Who am I to forgive you? You lost all compassion, wilfully. Only you can forgive yourself. This sword was meant for me. A Pandyan sword? Good. Then it must covet my head. Tell me. Why did you... Why did you invite me here? Do not say it was to reach a compromise. I would not believe you. If I did, I would not be here. So why did you come? What did you hope to gain? Hope? I no longer hope. My heart is filled with despair and bitterness. Happiness and peace elude those who hate themselves. You asked me for only one thing. Veera Pandiyan’s life. And I ignored your plea. That act has poisoned my life. And that poison is consuming me. The dead cannot be revived. Nor can the past be changed. Neither you nor I can undo past deeds. Can’t I make amends by surrendering my life? You came here to kill me and be avenged. And that’s why I’m here. So you can cut through this heart of mine. Death at your hands is freedom for me. Kill me. Kill me! Kill me. You cannot kill me. You’re right. I cannot. Because I live in your heart. What are you saying? I am Pazhuvettarayar’s wife. To the world, you may be the Pazhuvur Queen. But to me you’ll always be my Nandini. Look at me and tell me that I don’t live in your heart. Tell me you still do not shed a tear over me. Tell me you hate me. Say it! Come with me. I’ll give up my kingdom. I’ll sever all ties with my parents and family. Let us cross the seas to faraway lands. You mean more to me than my own life. I wish to live in a palace. Enjoy the privileges of royalty. And to sit on a throne. That is why I married Pazhuvettarayar. And tried to save Veera Pandiyan’s life. You lie. All lies! Lies. It’s the truth. So...kill me then. Let me die at your hands. Kill me! Go on. Where’s the prince? -Where is he? -In the palace. Does looking at me make it harder? I am not the Aditha Karikalan you once loved. I’m a murderer. A soulless body stands before you. Slay me. Prince! Prince. Prince! Go and see what’s happening. My prince. My prince. Oh no! Oh no! You murderer! You killed the prince. Vanthiyathevan, did you kill him? On whose orders? Arunmozhi’s? This spy came through the dungeons to assassinate the prince. Sinner! Did Arunmozhi send you here? Arunmozhi, you traitor! You killed my friend. For this sin, you must face my sword. Aditha, my child. Oh God! My clan is now doomed. We’ll be blamed. O Gods! Enough! Be silent. You invited the prince here. You’re responsible for his death. You were the one behind this conspiracy. Tie him up. You’ll answer for your crimes. Take Vallavarayan too. Let me go! I must stay with the prince. He is my prince. Let me go. “It’s a full moon night. “A time when the gods descend to earth.” May Aditha Karikalan rest in peace. May this Chola tiger rest in peace. May the destroyer of the Pandyans rest in peace. Can you not see it? Can you not see the victorious Chola sword? O beautiful flower Will you not garland him, O friend? O sacred fig tree! The Pandyan once ruled The head was severed A river of blood flowed All the riches of the sea belonged to our ancestors What has happened to Karikalan? I told this old man to protect the prince from danger. Daughter of Mandakini, did you all have your revenge? If your mute mother learns of this, she’ll be grief-stricken. Karuthiruman, silence! -Mandakini is your mother. -Stop! -Your father’s name… -I said, stop! Don’t you want to know who he is? Veera Pandiyan. King Veera Pandiyan. -Karuthiruman, didn’t we warn you? -Didn't we? Stop talking! Wretched me! For a few gold coins, I led Veera Pandiyan to the island where Sundara Chozhar was hiding. But the Chola escaped. They destroyed the island instead. Veera Pandiyan took revenge on Sundara Chozhar by using Mandakini. Ravidasan, look at me. You owe me an answer. Did Veera Pandiyan abduct my mother? Did my father conceive me in sin? Why did he hide the truth from me? Why did he pass me off as an orphan? Am I really Veera Pandiyan’s daughter? Spies watched over you as you grew up. Who do you think sent them? When the Cholas threw you out, who sheltered you? It was Veera Pandiyan…why? Before he died, he whispered: “Nandini, forgive me”. Those words came from his soul. To whom did he entrust his young son? In whose arms did he die? Why do you think we obey your commands? Because you are Veera Pandiyan’s daughter. My salutations to the Rashtrakuta King Khottiga! Welcome! We’re pleased you have joined us. Together we’ll rule from south to north. I have only one aim. To avenge the death of my dear friend, Aditha Karikalan. Thailappar, the Chalukya King, and Marasimmar, the King of Ganga have joined us. The Lankan King too is here with his army. We will behead Arunmozhi. Will that satisfy you? The Pallava army is ready to wage war. Khottiga, you’re going back on your promise. You said I do not need to betray my kingdom if I joined you. You promised to make me the Chola emperor without bloodshed. You swore on your daughter’s life. You will be emperor. Do not worry about the means. Do you want me to get the crown from an enemy in a begging bowl? Chola blood runs through my veins. Did you think I’d accept leftovers? Instead of becoming emperor with your support, I prefer to live as Arunmozhi’s slave. My own mother abandoned me. Aditha Karikalan, who claimed to be in love with me, threw me out of his kingdom. Veera Pandiyan abducted my mother and fathered me. Hiding this cruel truth from me till his dying breath. I was a mere puppet in their hands. The only one who loved me, without expecting anything in return was you, my husband. I’m eternally in your debt. Perhaps in my next lifetime, I shall make amends to you. Stop. Stop! Commander, Periya Pazhuvettarayar is in the Kottravai temple. Your Highness, he’s the murderer. He must be impaled. Kandhamaran! How do you know he killed Karikalan? Did you witness it? We found him near the prince’s body in the queen’s chambers. Why was he there? Sambuvarayar, how do you answer the charge against Vanthiyathevan? Your Highness, this fool spoke of it earlier. I did not believe him then, nor do I believe him now. I was misled and so invited the prince to Kadambur. Now we’re disgraced. Your Highness, I killed Karikalan. I promised the princess I’d give my life to protect him. For a moment, I failed. I failed in my duty. I failed to protect the prince. I deserve to be punished. Your Highness. I have committed treason against the Chola dynasty. My lust for Nandini clouded my senses. Unaware, I let the Pandyan rebels into my palace. I am responsible for Karikalan’s death. This Vanar warrior entered through the hunting lodge. I did not want him to raise an alarm, so I kept him in a stranglehold. He passed out. He could not have known who killed Aditha Karikalan. -So who did? -Your Highness, I went to Kadambur because I knew the prince's life was in danger. But the Pandyan rebels stopped me. They must’ve killed the prince to avenge their king's death. I could not save Karikalan. I’m responsible for his death. The Rashtrakuta army has crossed our borders. Malayaman, take your battalion and Periya Velaar's army to the north gates. Armour the war elephants. Emperor! If I am to die, let me die on the battlefield. Shields in position! Khottiga has been joined by the Pallavas and the Lankan army. His strength is three-fold now. But Aditha Karikalan is here with us in spirit. Karkan. Wait! Parthibendran, the Rashtrakutas are our enemy. We fought against them together. Today you and Arunmozhi are my enemies. So now the Rashtrakutas are my allies. Ponniyin Selvan has no desire to fight his brother’s best friend. Is he afraid that his army is not strong enough? Where is Pazhuvettarayar? Is he hiding in the Fort? Has he abandoned the young tiger? I came here in peace. I must avenge my friend Karikalan’s death before he turns to ash. You killed my friend. I will soak this earth with your blood. It is Arunmozhi’s head I want, for having sent you. Go, tell him. Parthibendran, stop. Arunmozhi, let me be the first to go. Let the first arrow strike me. That’s how I can atone for my sins. My father said you’d return to us before the battle began. Stand beside me. The Kaikola army will be under your command. Sound the war drums! Charge! Victory is ours! Victory is ours! Glory to Sundara Chozhar! Paranthaka Chozhar, the first vanquisher of the Pandyas. Gandarathidar, blessed by Shiva’s grace. Arinjayar, defeater of the Rashtrakutas, and Aditha Karikalan, beheader of Veera Pandiyan. Born of their illustrious race, Ponniyin Selvan has won a glorious victory. Glory to the son, born of the Sembiyan clan. Enough! The glories you speak of are past triumphs of my ancestors. I have a long way to go to attain such honour. Your Highness, you’ve anointed me the crown prince. So, does this crown belong to me? The crown is not what I offer, you have won it. So does that entitle me to give it to whoever I wish? Madhuranthakan has a right to this crown. Under your rule, he has governed unseen for twenty-five years. The kingdom will flourish under his rule. I wish to give the crown to my uncle, Madhuranthakan. Arunmozhi, no! I am unworthy. I was greedy. Greed and ambition are the hallmarks of a great king. We should win the Bharata kingdom. Hoist the Tiger Flag in the Himalayas. May Goddess Kaveri make our land more fertile and our crops bountiful. May knowledge spread. May temples be built. With our swords, Vallavarayaran and I will stand by you. Guided by our great uncle, Pazhuvettarayar. Glory to Madhuranthakan Devar! Glory to Madhuranthakan Devar! Glory to Madhuranthakan Devar! Glory to Madhuranthakan Devar! Mahout! O behold the king of kings! Conqueror of the four corners He has come to proclaim the end of slavery Humanity will prosper the world over Under the reign of the sun-clad warrior O, the Omnipresent one, the Omnipotent one Come forward to rule the rivers, the deserts and the forest Let the battlefield tremble with the touch of your sword Come charging like a fierce hurricane The comet that appeared in the Chola sky disappeared with the passing of Aditha Karikalan. Ponniyin Selvan built a large naval fleet, establishing the Chola kingdom across the seas. Fourteen years later following Madhuranthakan’s death, Ponniyin Selvan ascended to the throne. He became known as Rajaraja Chola, the king of kings. Ravidasan and the Pandyan assassins were captured and punished. In 1010 AD, Rajaraja Chola built the grand Peruvudaiyaar Temple in Thanjavur. A golden era was born under the rule of the great Rajaraja Chola. Victory is ours!
