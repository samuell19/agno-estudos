- Good morning! Morning. You okay? Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte, honey! What happened? - I found this girl on the beach. Is she okay? - I don't know, she seems to be. Can you get me those towels, please? - Okay. - Let's get her on the bed. All right. You wanna put some towels down? - She seems to be breathing all right. - Call Dr. Singh. - Should I call the police? There may have been a boating accident or something. Fine. Did she wake up yet? - Not since I found her. - I called in search and rescue just in case there's someone else still out there. - Thanks for coming. - At least she has good color, pulse is normal. Is clear, heartbeat is passenger normal. Pupils equal and reactive to light, no apparent head trauma, no fluid in her lungs. That's unusual for someone found in the ocean. - Is this the dress you found her in? - Yeah. - No underwear? - No. - Not something you usually go swimming in. - Maybe she fell off a cruise ship. You know, it happens all the time. - Beautiful. - That's my son at state finals last year. That's my wife and daughter. - Lucky. - That's what I keep telling 'em. Do you know where you are? 'Cause I found you on the beach with a dolphin, do you remember that? - Do you have any water? - Lots of water. We were worried about you, I thought you had a concussion, how do you feel? - I feel wonderful. - Do you have a name? - No, why don't you give me one? - I can't do that, everybody's got a name. - I don't. You have to give me one, I need one, something from here, I like it here. - How about Morning? - Morning? It's when I found you. - What's your name? - Michael. - Michael and Morning. I like that. What is that sweet smell? Chocolate cake. Would you like some? - Yes. - I gotta warn you, it's addicting, voila. Here you go. So you don't remember anything? - No. Just this place, you, and this cake. - How does it make you feel? - Sweet. - It's the police, come on in, I'll be right back. - Good evening, Mr. Pace. - Good evening, Constable Crick, Officer Smith. - We stopped by to get a photograph and some fingerprints of the girl, hopefully it'll help us identify where she came from. - Sure, come on in, she actually just woke up. - Did she say who she is? - She seems to have some sort of memory loss, but she seems to be okay, Morning? Morning, I want you to meet Constable Crick and Officer Smith. Hi. - It's good to see you up and about. - Thank you. - Mr. Pace said you were having trouble remembering things, but you do remember your name, eh? - It's just a name I gave her. - You gave her? - Yeah. - I think it's pretty. - You have an American accent. - I do? - Yeah, you do. I'd like to get some fingerprints and photographs, if it's all right, maybe help us identify where you came from. - It's okay. - As an unidentified person in the Bahamas, I'm obligated to inform you that you must stay in contact with police here in Eleuthera, until we can figure out your status. - I like it here. - The government is also obligated to provide you with a modest hotel room if you need it. - You don't have to do that unless you want to. - I want to stay here. - Very good, then, if you remember anything else, please let us know, have a good evening. Thank you, Constable. - He doesn't like me. - No, he just doesn't want you to be here alone with me. I want to be here with you. - I gotta take this, go ahead and finish your cake if you like. How you doing? - Hey, I know you're probably going out for dinner, so I'm calling to say good night, how are you? - Good. - You working on the script? - I'm trying to. Well, if I can get there any sooner, I will. - All right, fine. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - Well, I'll see you soon, love you. - You too. - Night.

Hi, Mikey, I'm pulling in at Gurunner's tomorrow morning, come and have brunch with some friends, I've got news on Tom. - You're gonna get yourself in a whole lot of trouble, Mr. Pace, that girl is a witch, she put a spell on you. - What is she talking about? - Take the day off, Charlotte, we'll talk about it later. - Why is she so angry? - It doesn't matter, you should get ready, though, 'cause I'm taking you somewhere. - Where are we going? - I'm taking you to a friend's boat. - I love boats, I love the sea, I love you. - Wait, where did you come from? - From your dreams. ♪ Oh, girl, you're so fine ♪ - Hey, there you go, told you it was addicting. - Everything here is addicting. - Hi, I'm Harry Sugar, you're hungry, huh? - What are you doing here? I missed you, so I took the red eye. - That's his wife, she wasn't supposed to be here, just pretend you're with me, can you do that? - Who's the bimbo with Harry? I don't know. Can you get me a margarita? - This is nice. I like it. We like having you here. - Hey, wake up, are you all right? You've gotta stop taking those sleeping pills, you've been flailing around all night. - What time is it? 10:30. - You should have woken me up. - I just did, I'm gonna go pick her up, do you want to come? Okay, sleepyhead, I'll see you later. - Oh, good morning, Mr. Pace. - Good morning. - Do you want me to make you an omelet or something? - No, no, no, thanks. - Didn't you sleep well? - No, I had bad dreams. - Oh, that's because you ate red meat, the spirit of what you ate came back to haunt you. - In the Out Islands today, Coast Guard officials reported finding a large, luxury, one-man yacht-- - Oh, I want to hear this. My brother said he saw them bringing in the boat this morning. The yacht, seen here, with the words "crimes against the sea" written across the deck in what appears to be blood has been taken to Governor's Harbor where local police and officials are investigating the case. The yacht, Sheer Luck, registered in Fort Lauderdale, is owned by Harry Sugar, an investment banker well known for his involvement in-- Isn't Mr. Sugar a friend of yours? Constable Crick? - Good morning, Mr. Pace, why don't you come on board? - You got any news on Harry yet? - Nothing yet. - What does that mean? - If we knew that, we'd probably know who did it. - Is that real blood? - Yeah, we also found broken fingernails dug into the deck, where apparently someone was dragged overboard. - You think that might be Harry? - They left Fort Lauderdale with a crew of four, they're all missing, we'll have to wait for DNA results before we can answer those questions. Can I show you something? - Sure. - So how long have you known Mr. Sugar? - About 10 years or so. Take a seat. I prefer to be filming. You want to film me? Mm-hmm. You want to take the camera? - Yes. Very well, then. Okay, I'm all yours now. - You know who she is? - No. More, more. - It was made last night, see the date on the clock on the background? - I've never seen her before. - Pretty girl, every man's dream, every man's downfall. - You think she has something to do with Harry's death? - I don't think she'd be strong enough to drag him across the deck, but she could have had friends. - Friends, what do you mean by that? - When's the last time you talked to Mr. Sugar? - I talked to Harry about a week ago. - His phone records indicate he called your house last night at 10 o'clock PM. - My house? - 823-3338, is that your house? - Yeah, that's my house, but I didn't hear anything. But you were at the house? - Yes, I was. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure, what is this? - Maybe he left you a message, the call lasted 40 seconds. - I'll have to go check my machine. - If there is something, Mr. Pace, I'll appreciate you letting us know. - I'll do that. - You know, Mr. Sugar spent a lot of money in this island, and helped a lot of people. - Yeah, he was a good guy. - And you know no one who would want to hurt him, eh? Man or a woman? - No. Would you excuse me, please? I don't know you, man. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Mr. Jacob's office. - Hey, Maryanne, it's Mike, can I talk to him? Yes, Mr. Pace, can you hold the line a moment? - How you doing, Mike? - Hey, man, did you hear about Harry? - No, what happened? - Well, they found this blood all over his boat with nobody aboard, and they think he's dead. - Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not kidding. Listen, when was the last time you talked to him? - Yesterday morning. - Did he tell you where he was? - Hell no, we talked about the Tom deal, and that was it, do they know who did this? - Not yet, is there any reason why you didn't call me about the Tom thing? - I did, you didn't get the message? - No, I got no message. - No, you gotta start checking your messages every so often, Tom wants to do a couple of smaller films this year, so we're gonna have to push your project back a little. How much longer? - He loves your movie, Mike, it's just gonna take a little longer, Mike, that's it. - All right, I'll talk to you soon. ♪ Don't touch ♪ Hi, honey. - Hi, Dad, how are you doing? - I'm good, how are you? - I'm good. - Hey. - Guess what? - What? - I got the lead in the ballet school recital. - Wow, you really like this dancing, don't you? - I love it, I actually have a video, I can put it on for a second. - Well, you know what, I have to do something, okay, maybe in a little bit, okay, sweetie, all right? - Okay, yeah. Maybe later or something. Mike, it's Bert, look, we need to talk about the picture, I got a problem with the schedule. - I just heard about Harry, is it true? - Yeah, they haven't found him or anything yet, it doesn't sound good at all. Hey, Mikey, I'll be on the island tomorrow, let's get together, call me, hi, Sherry. - When did that come in? - About 10 o'clock last night. - God, it sounds so weird hearing his voice, knowing he's gone. - Mr. Pace, you should come look at this. What is it? - It's Stacey, she's swimming with a dolphin, it came right up to her on the beach. - Goddammit. - What's a matter? - I don't know. - Stacey, get away from that thing, Stacey get away, Stacey get away from that thing! - What's wrong? - Just get out of the water! - It's just a dolphin, Dad, it wanted to play. - I want you to get out of the water now. - Shit! - Michael, what is the problem? - Look, I don't want either one of you in the water, is that understood? Don't listen to that thing, it's not your friend, it's not what you think. - What is going on? - I have no idea. - Oh, Mrs. Pace is not gonna be happy seeing you smoking again, you know. - Well, she's already mad at me. - She's just trying to figure out why you don't like the dolphins. - I don't trust 'em. - Oh, they're good spirits, they save people all the time. - What do you think happened on the boat today? - Baca. - Baca, what is that? - He's the evil spirit in voodoo. - And you believe that? - Oh, I don't even let it into my mind. - And you think this Baca is out there? - Oh, yes, good and evil. - And this has something to do with what happened on the boat? - If things don't make sense in the real world, you have to look to the other side. - How do I find out about this thing? - The Haitians, you have to speak to the Haitians. They still believe in the old ways. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello, is anybody here? Hello. - You need to stay away from them bars. - Get him off of me, get him off of me! - Settle down. Settle down in there, boy. Settle down. All right, I'll bring you some water if you settle down. You're not supposed to be back here. - What's he talking about? - Calling you a killer. - A killer, I don't even know this guy, I don't even know you, you're crazy, he's crazy. - That's what most people would say. - And what do you think? - I don't know. - Look, I came here to see Constable Crick, where is he? - He in the library, that's his new office. - Constable, here's the message on the microchip. - I told you it wasn't necessary. - I was with my wife at my house yesterday, and that includes last night, too. - You're not a suspect, Mr. Pace, I'm just looking for information, which is hard to find in cases like these. - What cases? - Disappearances, unsolved murders, most of them involving beautiful women, who then vanish themselves. - This has happened before? - 30 cases, 30 cases spread over 40 years. It may not sound like a lot, but in an island that has virtually no local crime, it's unusual, to say the least. Miami Herald, 1946, fisherman disappear off the coast of Eleuthera. 1950, two US Marine kill each other over island beauty. 1964, millionaire disappear with beautiful woman off the coast of Eleuthera, 1998, 2001, 2003, and now today's news. - And these cases were never solved? - None. - This is like the Bermuda triangle. - Yeah, that's what some people say. - And what do you think? - I don't know. - But you think there's something out there, Baca? - What do you know about voodoo? - Only what people tell me. - Jiamja, more like it, female spirit of the water, defending her domain. - Vigilante of the sea? That would make a good story for a movie, you know, beautiful women, black magic. Sirens of the sea. - Or maybe just plain old criminals, they make myths for their common crimes. - Let me show you something. What's this? - The Haitian you have in your prison tried to jam it down my throat this morning. - It looked like he's trying to scare you, maybe he's trying to extort some money from you. The man is crazy, anybody can see that. - Well, your assistant doesn't seem to think so. - That's because her parents are Haitians, she sympathizes with him. - What are you gonna do with him? - He's an illegal alien, he'd be deported tomorrow. - No due process or nothing? - Mr. Pace, we're a nation of 360,000 citizens. If we keep letting people into our country like you do in America, we'd be minorities in our own country in less than a year. - I'm not gonna argue with you on that one, if you can't feed 'em, don't breed 'em, that's my theory. Take care, Constable. Hi, honey. - What are you doing, it's three o'clock in the morning. - We're gonna make a movie. - About what? - About what's happening right here on this island, about what happened to Harry, everything. - And who's going to finance it? - We are. - Have you spoken to Bert about it? - He thinks it's a great idea, and he also got Terry Bamba to write a screenplay. - Terry Bamba? - Terry Bamba, he wants to do it, he knows the islands, and he knew Harry personally. - And he gets a million dollars a script. - But he wants to direct again, so I'm gonna give him a shot, and he's already agreed to do it on deferral. - But is he any good? - We'll see, if he's not, I'm gonna fire his ass, and replace him with somebody else. But at least we'll have a great screenplay. Well, I'm glad to see you enthusiastic about something again. What about her? - Mm, old picture, she gained 20 pounds. Hey, is this it? I got lost, it's like a maze around here. Hey, man, how you doing? Good to see you, how you doing? - Well, a month of coffee, Red Bull, and whiskey, and I'm not sure. I've never written anything this fast, here you go. - This is it? - Just finished. - Feels good. 98 pages, the way I like it, all right, listen, let me bring you up on what's going on, have a seat. - We've got 22 coming in, three from LA, two from Atlanta, and the rest from Florida. - All right, give us a couple minutes, and we'll get started, okay? - Okay. - Thanks. Is she getting you what you want? - Oh, she's fine, yeah, no, it's not easy to find a 20-year-old who's good looking, with some acting chops, and. - She bring any names? - Yeah, a couple, but I don't think we need 'em with the band, though. - The band is pretty good, but I do want to know how this story ends. - Well, you're gonna have to read it. What, you want me to read it to you? Yeah, would you read it to me? Are you guys ready to do this? - Yeah. - Yeah, let's get started. ♪ I can't deny it ♪ ♪ 'Cause those were the best years of my life ♪ ♪ But the winds have changed direction ♪ ♪ And I've been shown a light ♪ ♪ I was inspired ♪ - Do you know where you are? - Do you have water? How do you feel? - I feel wonderful. Do you have a name? - I don't. - And I need one. - Why don't you give me one? - You have to give me one. - Something from here. - Chocolate cake, would you like some? - Yes, lots and lots and lots. Lots and lots and lots. - That was amazing work, we'll let you know what we decide, and, all right, thank you, thanks a lot. - Thank you. - Thank you. Bye-bye, thank you, great job. - Thank you, gentlemen. All right, thank you very much. - Thank you. - We'll call you, appreciate it. So that's it? - Just a couple of no-shows. - Terry, what do you think? - Well, I still like the English girl, I mean, I know she's not the best looking, but she can act, and she knows how to make you feel, and care. - Does she make you horny? - Oh, come on, pal, give me a break, will you? - Come on, what do you think, Karen? - Well, I like the English girl, but she's a bit cold, and I think you're gonna need a body double for the nude scenes. - Think about the sex scene, she's gonna be all repressed. - She's English, it's a cold climate, come on. - Come on, Terry, no. - Hey, I can still bring in some more people, we can try the colleges, they all have theater arts departments, we could get lucky. She must be one of the no-shows. Excuse me for a moment. - Wow, that's kind of special. - This is the girl. What, you don't care if she can act or anything? - She can act. - She drove down from Savannah, and hit a lot of traffic, do you want to read her now, or should she come back in the morning? - Now. Okay, she's read the sides, let me get Ed back in here. I'm right here. Simone, why don't you come in and meet everyone? This is Simone Delacroix, did I get that right? - Yes. This is our director, Terry Bamba. - Hi. And our producer, Michael Pace. - Hi. - It's so nice to meet y'all, it's like a pleasure and a dream come true, to meet someone who's really from Hollywood. - Have a seat. So, you're from Savannah, Georgia? - Born and bred, woke up every morning of my life to the smell of crabs, swamp creatures, and paper mills. So what's this all about, it's kind of hard to tell from reading the scene. - Well, we're looking for a girl who can play the part of a siren. - You mean like from Greek mythology? - Yeah, exactly. - I love all those stories, The Odyssey and all that. - Have you done much acting? - Oh, I've been acting all my life, pretending I was a happy soul in a place that I wasn't, but I've also acted in plays, and I've read everything there is to know in the thespian profession. - Uh-huh. Yeah, so, you ready to do this? - I'm ready. - Okay, here's what I want you to do. Go back to the back corner there, and then you'll walk toward the chair, where you'll sit down, and you'll read the offstage lines with Karen here next to camera. I just need a minute to get into character. - Oh, you take all the time you want. Will do. - Do you know where you are? - No. Do you have any water? Yes, lots of water. How do you feel? - I feel wonderful. Do you have a name? - No, why don't you give me one? - I can't do that, everybody already has a name. - I don't, you have to give me one, I need one. Okay. - Something from here, I like it here. How about Morning? - Morning? It's when I first met you. - What's your name? Michael. - Michael and Morning, I like that. What's that sweet smell? Chocolate cake, you want some? - I want more. And more. And more. - All right, cut the camera, that was great. What happened to the accent? - Oh, well, you know how it goes, when you have a southern accent, people instinctually think you're unintelligent, I just thought it was an intelligent character. - Well, thank you for coming in, and I, that was, it was terrific work, and we'll let you know what we decide. - Thank y'all so much for this opportunity, it was so nice to meet you, well, good luck with the film. - Thank you. Whoa, that was amazing. - I think I'm gay. - And what do you think? - Sign her, now, right now. - Yeah. - It's beautiful. It's so amazing here. - So you decided to drop your southern accent? - I'm getting into character. What'd you think of the script? - It's erotic. I like erotic things. Hey, Adeline, I want you to meet Simone, Simone, this is Adeline. - Hi, Simone. Hi. - She'll get you whatever you want, come on in. What do you think? - I love the sea, all the colors. - Mostly sea, and always summer, that's what they say about this place. - Thank you for bringing me back here. - You've been here before? - In my dreams. How is she? - Hey, honey, I didn't see you there, how is who? - Your new siren. She's good, you read the script? - It's disgusting, you should be ashamed of yourself, you've ridiculed this entire family. - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about, can't you keep anything to yourself, do you have to tell the whole world your stupid sexual fantasies? - It's just a dream, honey, people have them all the time. - It reflects everything you think and feel, Michael. - That's total bullshit, and you know it. I talked to Terry Bamba about writing a screenplay, about something that happened on an island, that's all. - You gave him every intimate detail of your feelings for another woman, your cravings for her, how you seduced her, you set it in our house, with our housekeeper, and you even use her real name. - It's just a stupid dream. - Then why didn't you tell me about it?

That's right, as we already know, we start shooting Sirens this Monday. And we're all here on this beautiful island of Eleuthera, with its gracious residents, thank you very much, yeah, we have some members of the press, I would like to take this moment for them to ask any questions they may have, okay? - What's the movie about, and what part do you play, Seamus? - Well, I basically play myself. And it's about this dream I have in which I'm seduced by this beautiful siren, who's in fact here with us right now, come on. I wake up from this dream, and find out that Bert has been murdered, what appears to be the same girl that I dreamt about. Ooh. - And what is this crime? - That's the big climax to the movie, and we all know how important a big climax is. - Thank you again, enjoy yourselves, have lots to drink, and I'll see you at the movies. - You bet your fucking ass.

I mean, it's not that easy to take your clothes off in front of a bunch of strangers. - So why don't you do it now? Okay, in this scene, we've been dancing, drinking, our inhibitions are gone, the only thing controlling us now are our feelings, our lust for each other. We end up on the bed. Now, slide down my body, touching me everywhere. - I knew you would be here, you son of a bitch. - What the hell are you doing? Cover that thing up before I cut it off. - Crazy bitch. We were just rehearsing the scene for tomorrow. - Yeah, right, you think I'm stupid? How long have you known me, how long? Well, I'll tell you, long enough for me to know every little dickhead trick in that screwed up brain of yours, so get your clothes, and get out of here, now. I warned you to stay away from him, next time, I'll stick this up your skinny ass. Find someone else to play with. Let's go. You're such a stupid ass. God. I'll cut your balls off. - How's it going, Terry? - Oh, we're just getting ready to do the love scene. Morning. - Morning. Okay, we gotta get going, guys, I'm gonna lock this setup, if you're not involved in this scene, I want you out of here, that includes you, Brittney. - I'm staying. - Come on, now, don't start all your bullshit, okay, you're gonna ruin my performance. - That's exactly the point, asshole. - Look, Britt, you don't want everybody watching you do your big scene, do you? - I'm not screwing someone, so I don't give a shit. - Well, now you're starting to make me nervous, so I want you off of this set, or you're off of this picture, okay? - Hey, hey, just do what he says, okay, before you ruin everything. - Fine, I'm out of here, but I'm waiting right out there, and I'm gonna check you out as soon as this scene is over. Okay, let's go, let's go-- - You're sick, you know that? - You're the one that's sick. - Sorry. - Yes, can we roll now, please? - Yes, sir, yes, sir, okay, let him down, quiet on the set, and ready, sir? Yes. - Rolling, and speed. Are we slated? Yeah, we're slated, yes. We are rolling. - All right, all right, kids, now, I want you slightly breathless, okay, and action. - That was incredible. - You're incredible. Shit. - It must be hard watching your dream girl making out with someone else. - I'm just trying to make a movie. Shit, shit, shit. - God, now, that was great, that was wonderful.

She wanted to hear the new song. - Well, we're not doing that til Saturday. - I told you. - You want something to eat? - Yeah, what do they got? - They got everything, come on. Thanks, honey. How's the food? - Good. - Yeah? - Are those Haitians? - Mm-hmm, some of them, but they deport most of them now. - That's terrible. - What's so terrible about it? They over-breed in their own country, and they want the rest of the world to feel sorry for them, come on. - They can't punish people for having children. - I'm not punishing them, they're punishing themselves. How many families do you know in the US, have eight to 10 kids, and raise them properly? I don't think I'm gonna eat anymore. - Oh, of course not, you want to be politically correct, you want to feel sorry for them, right? Why are you doing this? 'Cause I want her to grow up and face reality, that's why. - You're bullying her. - I'm not bullying anybody. - You okay, Stace? Stace? What are you doing, are you okay? Is she okay, man? Yeah, she's okay, she's all right, don't worry about it. - It's okay, baby, it's okay, nobody's-- You're running in front the street, what's a matter with you? - Stop it, come here. Oh, honey, what's going on? - See that little girl over there, she freaked her out, I don't know why. - Do you know that girl? - No. - Then why did you get so upset? I don't know. They've got animals in there. - Man, this place is freaky. This is crazy. - Just keep it cool, all right? - That guy's got a machete. - Don't be such a chicken. Shit, Savannah! - She grabbed my hair. You guys are real. - All right, good, that's a cut. Oh, that's good, everybody, that's great, how's the goat, huh? Open your mouth, say baa, you're gonna be fine, my little friend, huh, you're free to go. - You sure you don't want another one? - No, I think that's it. - All right, everybody, that's lunch, let's go, let's lunch. - Hey, Terry, any improvement? - Mm, it's getting better. What's she doing here? - I decided to put her in the night stuff, why? - Because she's not supposed to be involved in the scene. Oh, but she's inside Seamus, she's his obsession, he can't get her out of it, just a couple of surreal shots. - All right. - I mean, look at that smile, huh, man? Those baby green eyes, the more we use her, the better. - This ain't no safe place for you to be, miss. - Get away from her, leave her alone. I don't understand what you're saying, okay? Come on, breathe, breathe, look at me, come on. Come on, we've gotta get out of here, that's good, baby. Come on, Britt, Britt. - All right, good, that's a cut, we got it. That's a cut. That was great, everybody, just great, we'll put the camera back-- - Seamus, Seamus, baby, what's wrong? Seamus, he's bleeding, someone help! Seamus, Seamus, baby, talk to me, Seamus. - Get the medic. - What happened? Seamus. - Something went wrong with the knife. Let's get an ambulance in here. - It must have jammed or something, it looks like it went right into his chest. - Wait, hold on, I'm gonna have to take that from you. - Peter. What are you doing here? - I came to spend time with my sister. - Oh, yeah, and how is she? - You know, you shouldn't have written what you did. - It's just a story, nothing more. - How many cameras were shooting at the time when this happened? - They're the only two we have. And how long after this did you pick up the knife? - 10 seconds. - And then you gave it to Officer Smith. - As soon as she came out on the set. - I'm gonna need copies of both these tapes, name and addresses of all crew member that was present at the time when this happened, that including phone numbers where I can reach them. I can do that. Give me an ambulance right now. - What about Brittney? - I'm not gonna press charges right now, but she won't be able to leave the country until I'm finished with my investigation. - What's with all this Haitian talk about evil spirits? Do you believe in that? - Do you? I know Mr. Pace doesn't, although I do recall him saying it'll make an interesting element for a film. - I can assure you, we didn't summon any of it for the film. - I doubt even you would have control over that. Gentlemen, thanks for your time, lady. - Look, guys, we have to finish this movie. I'm telling you, if Seamus was here, I'd guarantee you, he'd want to finish this film. We've only got two more days to go. Here. - Thank you. - Were you looking at him when it happened? - What kind of question is that? Of course I was looking at him, I'm the director. - Did you see Simone's reaction? You know that she was smiling and enjoying it? - And what are you saying? - This is gonna sound absolutely crazy, but I believe she's some sort of evil spirit or something. - You're serious? - You remember why we're making this movie, the dream that I had, well, she is the girl in the dream. - No, she only looks like the girl in the dream. - No, she is the girl in the dream, man. When I saw her walk in in the casting office, I knew she was the one, and she knew that I knew it. When she makes that sound when she comes, it's the same sound she made in the dream, man. I mean, when she moves, when she walks, when she does every little fucking thing, it is, it is her. - But you only dreamt you slept with her, I mean, this is becoming some sort of an obsession with you, man. - I wish that was the case. Stay here, stay here. What are you doing? - I don't like the storm, it scares me. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have come. - No, it's fine, I was just preoccupied with some work stuff, you want a drink? - Yes. - Wine or scotch? - Scotch, please. - Oh, give me that. - Thanks. - And sit down. - I think my nerves are shot after what happened last night. Mine are shot, cheers. - So do you think they're gonna start filming again, or? - We start again tomorrow. - Really, that's good, I think you're a great director. - Well, thank you. - Does he say bad things about me? - Who are you talking about? - Michael. I see the way he looks at me, he looks so angry. No, he likes you, he was the first one to say hire you. - Well, he obviously doesn't like what I'm doing now. - No, no, he does, believe me, he's just a complex personality, I'm telling you the truth, and you know what else? - What? - Well, I mean, he's not the one you have to please, I'm the one you have to please, and I love everything you're doing, and if I didn't like everything you were doing, I'd be all over you. - Well, maybe I'll have to start messing things up from now on. - How about I make you dinner tonight? - You know how? - Well, yeah, just take my phone, and I call Tippy's, and I order you whatever in the world you want. - That's cheating. - You always leave the house without your shoes? - I do it all the time, my toes like to be free. Why don't you warm 'em up? - Ooh, they're cold, they are cold. Yeah, they're cold in between there, too, I'll bet, huh? Warm that up.

Oh, yeah, huh? - Oh, you are such a bad boy. Wait a minute. And action. Don't get any closer, they're gonna try and board. - You can't leave 'em here! - There's too many of 'em, they'll take over the ship. - You can't offload 'em, nobody wants 'em. We'll take 'em to Florida, then. - They won't let you in, no one will take Haitians. Get off that ship, they're not gonna take over the ship. All right, now, that's a cut. That was great, everybody okay on deck here? - Yeah, yeah, we're good. - All right, Gary, you gotta shut that noise down. What can I do, it's a political rally. - Grab a big bag of green cash, and go over there, and shut them down now, Michael, how was that? - Look, don't worry about the noise, and we'll cover it with some music, all right, it was beautiful. - This is bullshit. - Am I gonna have to go in the water later? - No, but they're gonna have to wet you down. It's freezing. - No, it's good, I want you to look cold. - Well, you'll have to warm me up later. - What the fuck are you doing? - They're coming on the back of the boat, I don't know what we're gonna do, I need your help, I can't do this alone, come on. - You're sick. - It's just a movie, Stacey. - You're exploiting all those people who died. - I'm telling their story, and we can't tell the truth, so I'm telling it through the film. - You're doing it to make money, you're doing it to glorify yourself. - I'm just bringing attention to something that's going on around here. - That is a pathetic excuse. - Well, let's assume you're right, that I'm motivated by all the things that you say, it's still better to tell the story. Even if you don't want to face it. - I don't believe this. You're disgusting. - Why don't you tell people what you did? Why don't you do the right thing? No. You won't. Start the waves turning, get that boat going around and around here, faster, now, wind. - Yes, sir. - Come on, more wind, more wind. More wind coming, sir. - Faster, come on, more waves. All right, honey, everybody ready, we have speed? Yes, sir. - Okay, sugar face, and action. - Fear not, I'm here to protect you, a ship is already on its way. Everything is going to be fine. All right, do the dialogue one more time, and I need more wind, please. - Fear not, I'm here to protect you, a ship is already on its way. - One more time, more wind, come on, more wind. - Fear not, a ship is on its way. - Simone? Simone! - What was that? Let's get some divers over here, come on. - What happened? A girl fell in. Come on, dive in. What the hell is he doing? Simone? - Get the divers, now, someone's holding him down there! Let's get the other divers in here. What the hell are they doing? Come on, guys, get in the water. - Simone, are you okay? - Yeah. Did you see Bamba? What the hell's the matter with you people? - What? - The director, did you see him down there? - No. Let's get some more divers in here, come on, guys. Come on, get in there, hurry up, let's go. We've looked everywhere out here, we're gonna look further out. All right, keep looking. Roger that. - Whoa, careful, you okay? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't you touch her, don't you sit next to her, okay? - What's wrong with you? Hey, what's going on? - He went in the water, Terry went in the water to save her, and she pulled him down, you killed him, you come with me. - You're crazy. I'm not crazy, come on, come on, let's go. - You all right? It's gonna be okay. - Just play it back, just the last two minutes, okay? - Yeah. - Watch this. Okay, look, look, look, did you see that, did you see that? - How many other people were down there? - It doesn't matter how many people were down there, you saw what I saw. - Play it again. Look at the hand, that's her. - That's just a couple of hands. - She's one of them, just like you said, she killed him. - And how are you gonna prove that? That's just a couple of hands. - I had to shut it down, what do you mean? I don't have a director, they're suspending my insurance, and as far as I'm concerned, our leading lady is a damn murderess, yeah, I'll call you later. - You've gotta stop calling her that, she's gonna sue you. - Why is that, nobody believes me, not even you. You know, the only one that believes me is Crick. - He didn't say he believed you, he didn't say anything. - You know why, because if he did, everybody else would think he's crazy, that's why. Did they find him yet? - No, but you've gotta see this. - What is it? - Bamba's computer, Gary picked it up on the boat this morning to see if there was a shot list for the rest of the shoot, this is what he found. Look, guys, this is really disturbing, but you gotta see it, Mike, I mean, it's just crazy. Something's going on. How did they get on board, what are we gonna do? - Is this from the movie? - No, this, no, this is the feel thing. These are the real refugees, jumping on Harry's boat, and Bamba filmed it, this is where he got the whole idea for the story, I mean, this really happened on Harry's boat. This is crazy. - I don't know what to do, come on, you gotta help me out here, we gotta fucking kill 'em all. - See, there he is, there's Bamba. - Yeah. - He used all the stuff as reference material, and then staged it in the film, Bamba's filming all of this, the story he wrote really happened, I mean, he put this in the film, that's where he get the idea from. It's insane. - Oh my god, there's that little girl. - And Stacey. - Are you all right? - And that's Peter, what's he doing? - Stay here! Don't do it, don't do it. No, no! - Take my baby, take my baby, here, take her! My god. No! - Oh my. Why did you do it? Why did you do it, why didn't you tell us? - They said we would go to jail if we told anybody. - How many people did you kill? - Everyone. All of them that came on the boat. Oh my. - What happened to the rest? - We left them there. - Even the little girl? - Where's Peter? - Oh, I saw him driving to town. - She's gonna kill him, she's killing everyone that was on that boat. - Where did he go? - I don't know. - Okay, listen, I want you to destroy everything that's on this computer, I want you to get her out of this island. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna go find Peter. You want me to go with you? - Stay with her. - Simone? Simone, are you there? Hey, Simone? Hey. - Come in, do you want something to drink? I can get you some juice or something. - Just some water. - On ice? No, no, thanks. I shouldn't have called, I just wanted to apologize for my father again. It's like his whole personality has changed. - I just don't know why he would say so many terrible things about me, it's like he hates me or something. - He doesn't hate you, he's just going crazy. Look, don't cry. - It's just that I had to go through all of these horrible things all alone, and no one, no one even bothered to come check on me. Except for you. Thank you, Peter. - I'm sorry. - No. I liked it. Come with me. Last one is who buys lunch. Hey, come here. I'm gonna get you. - Oh, you'd better look out. Follow me. - Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! Where's my son, hey! Where's my son, what'd you do with him? Hey, where's my son! - I don't know. Peter! He went under. Where's my son? - I don't know. - Where's my fucking son, where is he? He went under. - Listen, I'll fucking kill you, where's my son? Die. Tell me. - I don't know. - Where is he? - He went under-- - Where's my son? Tell me. - I didn't do anything. Tell me. I'm gonna fucking kill you, bitch, tell me! I'm gonna kill you. Please, no! - Hey, what are you doing? - Die, you fucking! Let her go! Where is she, what the hell did you do, man? You killed her, you crazy son of a bitch. - I saved my son, that's what I did. We got her, we're bringing her in. Condition? No vitals. - We'll come and get her. Excuse me. - Excuse us. Get George Simmons on the phone. - What are you gonna do? - I gotta do what I gotta do. - But he didn't do anything, he thought she was gonna hurt him. - This is a murder. - They're gonna take him to jail. - Don't worry, I got a good lawyer, don't worry about that. - Sorry, Mr. Pace, but I'm gonna have to arrest you for the murder of the young lady. - What, she's not, she's not, she's not real, she never existed, you know that, she used me, she used me to bring you all back her so she could kill you, you know that, son, she used every one of us to come here, you know, so she could kill us, you understand, you know that, right, honey? You know, just let me see her. Show him. Oh my god. No. - No, Stacey, no! Oh my god. - I thought I told you to stay with her, to watch her the whole time, I told you to get her off the island. - They told me you'd killed a siren, I'm sorry. - Look at her now, she's dead! I told you to stay with her, you killed her, man. - Sorry, Michael, it's not my fault-- - You killed my daughter, don't you understand what I'm saying? Look what happened, she's dead. Sherry. I'm sorry. - I've been looking for you for two hours. - You're a very persistent woman, Mrs. Pace. - I finally talked to the little girl. She said that the dolphins and a lady in a white dress saved her from the sea. - A lady in a white dress? - Your siren. - So you finally believe, eh? - I need to believe. - I'm very sorry for what happened to your family, but you'd be interested to know that I contacted the police in Savannah, Georgia. They told me that Simone Delacroix disappeared in a boating accident over six months ago - Is that true? - Yeah, they're sending me documents and photograph as evidence. - So will that be enough to get him off? - When I spoke with the judge, he said that he would review the case, however, we're still gonna have to prove that she wasn't a real person. - Well, how are we going to do that? - We're gonna have to prove that she's still here. Go!
