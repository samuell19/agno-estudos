[orchestral music playing] I just wanna know one thing, Frito. Who was the guy sitting next to Don Ding-dong? It was his brother, Don Twinkie-knee. [Don Frito] He is a food chief in another country. [Mary Kay] You always win, don't you Frito? [Mary Kay] You always win. It was between the brothers. I had nothing to do with it. [Mary Kay] I'm going to leave you, Frito. I'm going to take your children, born and unborn. [Don Frito] You're not taking my children. [Don Frito] You're not taking my children! [whoosh] [Don Frito coughs] [Don Frito] Don't you know I could never allow it? That I would use everything in my power to keep that from ever happening? [Don Frito] I don't think you blame me for your miscarriage. For having sent you to the fat farm to lose weight, since I don't allow you to eat anything other than junk food. But I can change! Mary Kay... If history has taught us anything, everything can change! You don't get it, do you? It wasn't a miscarriage, Frito! It was an abortion! An attempt at abortion. They were twin boys, Frito. Two sons! [Mary Kay] But I've taken them, and I've hidden them away from you someplace safe! Someplace you'll never find them! Where are my boys? [Don Frito] Where are my boys? -[Mary Kay] No! -[squish] [trumpets playing] -[fake plane noises] -[Marilyn laughing] [Kennedy laughs] One of these days, Marilyn this rocket will launch a man to the moon! [Marilyn] Really? [Marilyn] Jack, can I touch your rocket? -[Kennedy] Sure. -[Marilyn swoons] [Marilyn] Oh, Jack! Launch me into orbit! [door shuts] [Kennedy] Oh my god, it's Jackie! [Kennedy] If she finds you here, we're both through! -[Marilyn shrieks] -[Kennedy] You have to go! [Marilyn] Where? [Kennedy] Anywhere! No, this way! -[Marilyn] But, I thought-- -[Marilyn shouts] -[glass shatters] -[Marilyn screaming] Jack! [Kennedy] Oh, thank god! I thought you were Jackie! In the bedroom? I'm so glad to see you! Is everything okay? Well, yes, I had twins! Two boys! I think they're boys. Are they mine? [Mary Kay laughs] No, they're Don Frito's. -[choir singing] -[Kennedy] Thank god! [Kennedy] I mean... thank god they're his! [Kennedy] I-- Healthy! [Kennedy] They are healthy, aren't they? They have great hair! [Mary Kay crying] I just didn't know where to turn to! I just didn't know who to see! -[Kennedy] Now, now. -[Mary Kay] Sorry. I'm sorry. [blowing nose] [Mary Kay] Thank you. I'm sorry! [Kennedy] Now, now, now. [Kennedy] If I can't help the gorgeous women whom I'm intimately involved with with their problems, then what good am I? Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure! [Kennedy] Why, um... There was this Vietnamese girl I was seeing once. She had a problem with a fella back home. I sent in the troops! -[snap] -It'll be over like that! [Mary Kay giggles] I just didn't want little Angelo and little Michael to be raised his way. The Frito way. So, I hid them and... The next thing I know, he told me he was gonna murder me if I didn't tell her where those kids were! [Kennedy] Well, where are they? They're with my grandparents, [Mary Kay] They helped with the delivery. [Mary Kay breathing heavily] [Mary Kay groaning] Push! Come on, Mary Kay! Push, push! Come on, Mary Kay! Come on! -[Miserio] Try a little harder! -[Mary Kay screaming] [Miserio] Come on! Alright! [Miserio] One more time, now! And a one, and a two... -[Miserio] ...and a three! -[Hilda] Three! [fart noise] -[bang] -[baby grunts] [Mary Kay sighs] [Miserio] Hey, wait! [Miserio] It's a boy! [Miserio] It's a boy! What a peeshadel! It's a beautiful peeshadel! [Al Dente gasps] Whoa, wait! Wait a minucce! [Miserio] I see another head! Or maybe it's an ass? I no can tell! [Mary Kay screaming] -[whoosh] -[fart noise] -[bang] -[baby grunts] -[baby groaning] -[Mary Kay shouts] [lullaby playing] I didn't know your grandparents were still alive. Somewhat. My grandfather, he's great. His name's Miserio. He came from the old country. -[splashing] -[Miserio groaning] [Kennedy] A real immigrant. [Kennedy] That's the greatness of this country. [Mary Kay] He was a politician, too, you know? [Mary Kay] He was a great speaker. -[splash] -[Miserio gasps] Hey... The United States of Antarctica! The land of opportunity! Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what you can do for yourself! -[applause] -[Miserio] Capisce? Not bad! That's not bad at all! Listen. Here's what I want you to do. Michael and Angelo... They're safe with your grandparents, right? -[Mary Kay] Yes. -[Kennedy] Leave them there. I'm going to send you away for a little while. There's this lovely little island paradise off the coast of Florida. It's called Cuba. You'll love it there. I'll take care of Don Frito. [Mary Kay] Jack, I am scared! [Mary Kay] Frito's a dangerous man! [Mary Kay] What if he finds me? [Mary Kay] What if he hurts you? [Kennedy laughs] Mary Kay, what could possibly happen to me? I'm the president! [bang] [dramatic music playing] [music crescendo] [whistle] [whoosh] [poof] [dramatic music continues] [car horn] [splat] [Michael] Jeez, it's hot out here! [Michael] Oh, my pits smell like an orangutan! [Angelo] Yeah, they do. [Michael] Ang, somebody's coming! -[Michael] Assume the position! -[Angelo] Okay! [Redwood] Hello? [Redwood] My name's Redwood. Redwood Stump. [Redwood] What's your names? -[Michael] You look just like! -[Angelo] The resemblance! -[Michael] It's amazing! -[Angelo] Uncanny! [Michael and Angelo] The Riddler! [Michael and Angelo laughing] -[dramatic music playing] -[chicken snickering] [Redwood] The bus should be coming along soon. [Michael] Yeah, I'm sure it will, but, listen, until it gets here, you don't mind if we tell you a bit about ourselves, do ya? [Michael] We're twin brothers. [Angelo] Yeah, the Misery brothers! [Michael] To know about us, you gotta understand about our family. [Michael] It always starts with family. The heads of the other junk food families, Don Dorito, Don Cheeto, Don Pretzel, are very angry about our cutting prices! There will be slashing and bloodshed in the marketplace in retaliation! And there's even rumors of an all-out war between the families! Maybe federal intervention! You've got to make some small token concession! A billion-dollar donation to the FDA would buy us some valuable time! [chair creaking] You come to my home... ...on the day I am to be reunited with my forever lost sons. And you ask me to commit the ultimate sin. Voluntary giving money to the federal government! What's the matter with you? Are you...? Am I what? [Don Frito] I can't remember the last time you came to my house for a cup of coffee! [advisor] You don't drink coffee! [advisor] Can I be your special friend, Fairy Godfather? [Don Frito groans] Keep going. Up the arm! [Don Frito moaning] The bulging biceps! All the way! [Don Frito moans] [Don Frito] Finally, I can drop the manly mumble voice, this masquerade I've been leading! I can come out of the cupboard and say, "I want to be me!" -[Don Frito] I want to be me! -[advisor wailing] [Don Frito weeping] [coughing] It's nothing personal! Strictly business! [Don Frito clapping] [gears turning] I drink a little more than I used to. [playful music playing] [clang] [Don Frito gulping] [Don Frito sighs] [Don Frito] Ah! [Don Frito burps] [gulping continues] [Don Frito burps] [cuckoo clock cooing] [gulping continues] [Don Frito burps] [playful music continues] [click] [click] [burst] It seems that our associates have finally had some luck in finding your sons. You mean I'll finally have heirs to the Frito fortune? Someone to rely on? To manage my affairs? Someone that can carry on the Frito way? Family tradition? No... but you do have two sons. Tell me! What are they like? Handsome? Powerful? Masculine men? The type that can walk into a room and everyone notices them? The type of men that, when you meet them, you can never forget them? Are my boys like that? [cough] They... certainly make an impression. [Love mumbling] [Euretha] You can't really beat this. [Love sighs] Well, my work is done here! [door opens] [Luke] Man, that woman's crazy! [Luke] Ya'll just wait here. I'm going in first. I've gotta prepare him for the experience of meeting ya'll for the first time. [Luke] I'm sure it's gonna be a very emotionally trying experience for him. Not to mention, this man's got a bad heart! No problem! We won't mention his bad heart! Our lips are sealed! [click] [Luke] Don Frito... My name is Luke. Luke! Luke! I can't tell you how long I've waited for this moment! How much meeting you means to me! -[Luke] You what? -[Don Frito] No, no, no! Please don't speak! Don't ever speak! Where was I? What was I saying? You were saying, [Luke mimicking Don Frito] "How I can't wait to meet this moment! How--you. How much!" [Don Frito] "Meeting you means to me." I know where I am now. Thank you. Luke... Search your heart! Look deep inside! I'm your father, Luke! [Don Frito] You know it to be true! [Don Frito] You don't know the power of the dark side! [Don Frito] Channel your anger! [Don Frito] Let it consume you with rage against the federal government! [inspirational music playing] [Don Frito] And together, as father and son, we will rule the food universe! It's your destiny, my son! Say what? No, no, no! I'm not your son, man! What? I'm Luke Stairclimber! Who? I'm Luke Stairclimber! [Don Frito] Oh... I'm the detective hired by Haagendas to find your sons! Oh... [Luke] Don Frito... These are your sons! [dramatic music plays] [Michael] Daddy? [Don Frito groans] Daddy! [Don Frito groans loudly] [groaning intensifies] [Angelo and Michael groaning] [slam] [farting] [Michael] That was the first and last time we met our father. Just as we were getting to know him! He was gone with the wind! But even though we only knew him for a brief moment, there was a convulsion! Something was there between us! You could just feel it! -[Michael] A bondage thing! -[Angelo] Yeah! -[Redwood grumbling] -[Michael] Anyway... That one meeting... would change the course of our lives! -[Michael] Forever. -[Angelo] Forever. [Michael] And forever began at Daddy's funeral. -[upbeat music playing] -[clapping] [cheering] [choir singing] [singing intensifies] [loud applause] -[screaming] -[whistling] [Scheister] Yeah! [Scheister] Thank you, Precious Hearts! [choir cheers] Can I get an "amen"? [crowd] Amen! [Scheister] Praise the lord! [crowd] Praise the lord! I said, praise the lord! [crowd] Praise the lord! -[Scheister] Hallelujah! -[crowd] Hallelujah! Glory, glory! Hallelujah! [cheers] Walk a dog! [crowd] Walk a dog! [Scheister] Take out the trash! [crowd] Take out the trash! Yeah! And that's the reason we are here today! [crowd] Praise the lord! Quiet! [Scheister] I wanna hear a pin drop! [ding] [Scheister laughing] Now... As I was attempting to say, [crowd] Yeah? [Scheister] We are here today to show our disrespect! Our final disrespect! [woman] I'm over it! To a man, known to us all... ...as Jeffrey Dahmer. [Angelo] We're at the wrong funeral! [Scheister mumbling] [Scheister laughs] No, no, no. As, uh... Don Frito Layleone! [crowd jeers] [Michael] Yeah. [Scheister] Don Frito Layleone was a great and filthy rich man! [crowd cheering] Yes, he was! He gave freely of his colossal wealth to all those causes in which he truly believed he could buy! [Scheister] But... he died before his mission, our mission, was complete! And now, due to certain accounting errors... [Angelo] Who did he have working for him? [Scheister] ...our beloved Second Son of Mary needs seven million dollars... [Angelo] That's a lot of money! [Scheister] ...to keep it's divine doors open! The church needs this money! I need this money! [woman] Wait a minute! Just last night, the lord almighty, himself, in his infinite voice, spoke to me! [crowd cheers] Saying, "Scheister!" [crowd] Scheister! "Scheister!" [crowd] Scheister! "If you don't get that money by noon, next Sunday, I will strike you dead!" [zapping] [Scheister grumbling] [Scheister shouts] His hair looks like Don King! [Scheister] One, two, three, four! [choir singing] -[Michael sobbing] -[bam] -[Michael] Whoa! [audience clapping] [car brakes screech] [loud car horn] [crunch] The reason I called you all here today Is for the reading of Don Frito Layleone's last will and testament. [Scheister] Old Testament or New Testament? [lawyer] Latest Testament. Let's hear what he has to say. [click] [Don Frito] I hereby confess to the murders of-- [click] [tape player squeaking] [Don Frito] I, Don Frito Layleone, being of somewhat sound mind and out-of-shape body, do hereby bequeath my entire junk food empire to my only know living heirs. [Don Frito] My two sons, Michael and Angelo. -[Michael] No way! -[Angelo] Way! [Don Frito] However, there are two conditions. [Don Frito] One... [Don Frito] The two of you cannot be convicted of a felony for a period of one year. [Don Frito] Two... [Don Frito] You both must be married within one year in order to intend to bear children and carry on the family name. [Don Frito] In the event either of these conditions are not met, my entire estate will then be bequeathed to the Second Son of Mary Church. [Scheister] Hallelujah! [Scheister laughing] [Don Frito] Amen. [laughing continues] [rustling] [Angelo] Ain't life grand? [Angelo] Our whole lives, we've only had each other. [Angelo] Our morals, our pride, our dignity, our self-worthlessness. [Michael] Yeah, now we have 200 million dollars! [Michael and Angelo laugh] [Angelo] Hey, you don't think we'll change, do ya Mike? You can take a Misery out of the sewer, but you can never get rid of the stench. Yeah, I guess you're right. You don't think Daddy would be upset with us for knocking over his casket and getting run over by a truck, do you? No, these things happen from time to time. I know, but I still feel guilty, him having to be cremated and all. I'm sure he wanted to be buried here at Frito Lawn with the rest of his dead family. Ang, put yourself in his shoes. Okay. If your body was mangled, your head decapitated massive chunks of your face missing, because they were ground up by a truck axel. Would you want to be put in the ground looking like that? Next to people who know you? Yeah, I guess you're right. [Michael] Of course I'm right! It's better this way! Look, he'll be happier here, amongst his family! People who know him and love him for what he's done for us! Yeah... [Michael] Come on. Let's find somewhere nice to put him. [Michael] Somewhere comfy. Operation Date-Bait is ready to ramble. Here's the plan. The girls come over, and our two bozos will think they're doing good with them. The girls have been instructed to compliment them at every opportunity and laugh at all of their jokes. Soon, after a little dancing, a little dinner, a little hanky-panky, and then, they dial 911-RAPE. Hasta la vista, Misery brothers! Hola, dinero. [Scheister laughing] You sure this will work? [Haagendas] Listen, if you were on a jury, would you honestly believe that two beautiful women would actually willingly have sex with these two? [Scheister laughs] I get your point. [Angelo] I can't believe Tom Haagendas offered to help us find wives. [Angelo] I think we have a real friend! [jazz playing] Hey, Ang! You look good! You, too, Mike! If I was a girl, like your sister, instead of your brother, I would date you. Thanks, Ang. Sure, Mike. Just remember! These girls aren't like what we dated in the past! They've got, uh... ... declassee! Okay. Now, let's go over the "don'ts" one last time. Don't cop a feel, never spit without a spittoon, don't adjust the family jewels, -[Angelo] except now, -[squeaking] and, um... Oh... don't tell no tall tales! Exactly! Just don't be ourselves and everything should go smooth! Like butter on a melon! -[knocking] -[girls] Knock, knock! [Angelo] Who's there? [Bambie] It's Bambie! [Fauna] And Fauna! "Bambie and Fauna" who? [Bambie and Fauna] Your dates! -[wind blowing] -[slam] [trumpets playing] [moaning] Your high-beams are on. We took a cab. [Bambie gasps] [Angelo sighs] [Angelo] Hey! [slow music playing] [Barbie and Fauna] Ooh! [Barbie giggles] [Fauna] Thank you. [Barbie and Fauna laughing] [squeak] [pop] [Quazzie] Chateau Frito. [Quazzie] South Bronx. [Quazzie] Last week. [Michael] Ooh! [Barbie and Fauna laugh] [Barbie and Fauna] Wow! -[slam] -[Quazzie] I hope you enjoy it! -[Michael] Thanks, Quaz! -[Angelo] Thanks! Nothing like fine wine and cheese! [Angelo] Nothing like it! [plop] [Barbie and Fauna giggling] -[plop] -[clanging] I wanna propose a toast! [Michael] Just a few days ago, my brother and I were merely actors. Master thespians, performing on the cruel stage we call life. [Michael] But now, due to the timely death of our father-- [Angelo] Timely. [Michael] To who we are forever grateful-- [Angelo] Forever. -[Michael] A toast to Daddy. -[Barbie and Fauna giggling] L'chaim! Szechuan! Today, the chef has prepared some real good food! What is it? I got no freaking clue! I just serve it! -[Quazzie] Bon appetite! -[crash] [Barbie and Fauna chuckling] [Michael] So, how do you ladies know Tom Haagendas? I used to do his brother. And I used to do his sister. That's real nice! Keeping it in the family and all! How about you two? Oh, we're strictly heterosapiens. Strictly. [clap] Today, we have a real dessert treat! [bam] Torched Alaska! [creak] [fire blazing] [Michael] Maybe later, Quazzie. [Michael] We're still chowing down our luncheon. [Michael] It's been very, very good! [Michael] Very good! [Quazzie] I'm so glad you all liked it! Did you ever find out what it was? Oh, yeah! The chef said it was black stallion! [Barbie and Fauna] What? Horse meat! [Quazzie] But don't worry! [Quazzie] They haven't killed a horse recently or nothing! You see, there was this horse. [rip] [Quazzie] They cut his head off years ago for some gangster movie. [Quazzie] But they didn't want to waste the body! [Barbie and Fauna heaving] Him being a thoroughbred prize-horse, they just tossed it into the meat locker with the other stiffs! [gushing] [spitting] [Quazzie] You don't have to throw up on that! [Quazzie] It ain't fattening! [Barbie and Fauna crying] [Quazzie] They both have weak stomachs! [Fauna] B-B-B-Bing! [Fauna and Angelo laugh] [Fauna] B-B-B-Bing! [Fauna making plane noises] [bubbling] [bubbling] [Barbie] The jets aren't very strong. [Michael] They're not on... [Michael] I've got gas. [Barbie] Oh, god! [Michael] How about some bubbly? [Michael laughs] [Barbie and Fauna chuckle] I love bubble baths! It makes me feel so... bubbly! [Michael giggles] I love when the bubbles go up your rear end! [Barbie] Ooh! My little friend's getting very happy! [Fauna] Ooh! Can I say hello to your little friend? Can I say hello to your little friend? You want to say hello to Mr. Python? Oh, yes! You want to say hello to King Cobra? Yes! -[snakes hissing] -[Fauna shrieking] -[Michael yelling] -[Barbie shrieking] [Michael] Hey, come on! You're gonna scare the snakes! [Angelo] Yeah, and I think you made me go in my pants! [Barbie and Fauna screaming] [Michael] Hey, girls! Girls, listen! [Michael] Look, we're real sorry! [Michael] We didn't mean to spook you or nothing! [Angelo] Yeah, it's just a Jumbo Frito candy bar! -[Michael] See! -[Barbie and Fauna whining] [Barbie] Can you just get us a blanket, or a towel or something? [Fauna] Yeah, before we freeze to death! [Angelo] There ya go! [breathing heavily] [Angelo] Look, Mike! Hey, Mike! Look, it's electric! [zapping] [Barbie and Fauna shrieking] [zapping intensifies] I heard the girls almost died. [Haagendas] Well, they're still on life support, but the doctor said they should pull through. [Scheister chuckles] I'll say a prayer... for you. So, I may have underestimated the enemy! Big deal! Hitler underestimated the Russian winter, but he didn't freeze to death, did he? I'll give you one last chance! Well, that's all the chances that I'll need. [banging] [door creaks] [Quazzie] Who are you? -[click] -[Dolly] Strip-to-Kill. [whip cracking] [Quazzie] Strip to kill who? [Dolly] Let me in, or it's gonna be you! [squish] [Angelo] I wonder if it's a Michelangelo. [Michael and Angelo laugh] [clanging] [Angelo] Whoa... [Michael] Hello, dolly... [Angelo] Hello! [Dolly] Hey, how did you know my real name? [Michael] Call me psychic. Psychic, huh? [Dolly] I'm looking for Michael and Angelo Misery Layleone. [Dolly] You know them? [Michael and Angelo] Intimately! You're sexual preference is none of my business! Live and let die! You know what I mean? I don't think you understand. You calling me stupid? No! [Dolly] Oh, my whole gold-digging life! Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! That's all I ever heard! And I'm sick of it! Can I help it if I was blessed with the money to buy these? -[swishing] -[Dolly] Well, can I help it? My brother and I are thrilled that you had the money to buy your bazookas! [Angelo] Yeah, I'd love a pair! [Dolly laughs] Wait a minute! Did you say... brothers? As in the Misery brothers? Michael. And Angelo. [Michael and Angelo] At your service! [Dolly chuckles] [Dolly] Well, how do? [Michael] How do what? [Dolly laughing] You're so silly! [Dolly] I'm southern comfort. Your surprise welcome home present from Mr. Haagendas. [Angelo] That is so nice of him. [Angelo] You should send him a thank you card. [footsteps] [beeping] [fast-paced music playing] [stereo] [Yiddish song continues [tearing] [Angelo and Michael chanting] [Angelo] Mike, come on! Get up! [Michael] Whee! [Angelo] Come on, Mike! Get up! [Angelo and Michael chanting] [clap] [Michael laughing] -[Angelo laughing] -[Michael] Whoo! -[bang] -[glass shatters] [song continues] -[bang] -[glass shatters] [Angelo and Michael barking] -[Angelo] Hey! -[Michael] Hey! -[bang] -[crack] -[bang] -[crack] [Angelo and Michael] Whoo! [Angelo and Michael grunting] [Angelo and Michael laughing] [bang] [whistle] [click] [Angelo and Michael shout] [Michael groans] [Michael] Oh, my head hurts...

[slam] [clatter] [Angelo] Hey, you forgot your boombox. [Michael] Bye-bye! [jazz playing] [Dolly whining] [Dolly screaming] [boom] [phone ringing] [click] I know what you're gonna say, but I swear it wasn't my fault! Everything was going great! She danced... got down and naked! She just had no focus! Her tits were too big! It was like, "slam, bang, kaboom"! The whole thing lasted less than five minutes! Now that it's over, she'll never dance for a man again! [Mrs. Haagendas] Tom, it's your wife! [Mrs. Haagendas] I was calling to ask if you wanted macaroni or casserole for dinner, but it sounds like you've already had dessert! -[Mrs. Haagendas] I'm slaving-- -[click] [phone ringing] [click] [Scheister] It's me! Hey, I heard what happened. You already talked to my wife? [Scheister] Listen carefully! These brothers, they're real pros! Bad boys in a good hood! But bad ain't never messed with worse! And good ain't never tangled with supreme! You hear what I'm saying? Huh? [Scheister cackling] [Michael and Angelo snoring] [dramatic music playing] [Michael and Angelo gasp] [Michael and Angelo shriek] [playful music playing] [Quazzie] Good morning, guys! [Michael and Angelo] Morning, Quazzie. Did you guys sleep well? Just like two crying babies. Hey Quazzie, can I ask you a question? Sure, as long as it's not hard or nothing. What did Daddy do for fun? I mean, all of this is great and everything, but I'm starting to feel... constipated. [Michael] Yeah, Ang. Very congested! Ever since we've been bestowed with all this fame and fortune, I feel like a celebrity or something! I feel like Madonna! Hey, why don't you guys get away for a few hours? There's a limo! Take it! Go shopping or something! [Michael] I don't feel comfortable driving no limo. Yeah, and they're so hard to park. Ain't that the truth? Suit yourselves! [playful music continues] [buzzing] Hey, Mike! Look over there! That, my brother, is a slice of pure Americana! -[Angelo] Tijuana, anyway. -[Michael laughs] [Angelo] Come on! [buzzing continues] What a piece of hardware! You must be very proud! Si, señor! This is the best leaf-blower I've ever had! I bought it at Sears, where America shops! We're talking about the car! -[crash] -[man in hat] Oh... si, señor!

Where is he? -[Roddy] Right over there! [Angelo whispering] He ain't really there! [rattling] -[grinding] -[whack] -[girl grunts] -[slam] -[cheering] -[Roddy] Yeah! [dinging] [Michael chuckles] [girl] That referee is crooked! I have an idea! -[bagpipes playing] -[Roddy] So... [Roddy] Is there anything else I can do for you gentlemen, like your lawn, your girlfriends, your hair? Why don't you get a new barber, huh? [Roddy] You too, champ! [Roddy laughs] [girl] Excuse me, mister ref? [Roddy] Oh, absolutely! [girl] But can you help me with these bagpipes? [Roddy] That was you, huh? [Roddy] Sounded like dinner was late at the dog pound, but I'll teach ya how to blow my horn-- [ding] -[Roddy cackles] -[slam] [bagpipes playing] [Michael] Uh-oh... [ding] -[boing] -[Michael and Angelo groaning] -[bam] -[Michael and Angelo] Oh! [slam] [Angelo] I remember it like it was only last week! [respirator beeping] It was only last week, Ang. But from there, after what had been the best time of our lives... everything was about to turn to shit! [Michael mumbling] Don't worry, I'll get her! I'll take her out! [Al] Up and at 'em, fellas! -[Michael] Huh? -[Al] Up and at 'em! [Michael grumbling] [Michael and Angelo shout] [Al] Oh, I'm sorry! Wrong card! -[Al] Oh! I'm so embarrassed! -[Michael] Ooh! [Al] Mom would kill me if she knew I still carried this picture of her! [Al] She lost a lot of weight, you know? [Al] Yeah, her and Opera! [Al] Do you guys wanna see? [Michael] No, no, no! [Al] My name is Lieutenant Al Dente. [Michael] Uh... Hi, Al! [Michael] I'm Michael Misery. [Michael] That's my twin brother, Angelo. [Angelo] I'm Angelo Misery. Nice to meet ya! [coughing] [Al] Excuse me a moment! [Michael] Sure, Al. [Angelo] Take your time, Al. [sniff] You're absolutely positive? I took the samples, myself! There's no question whatsoever! It's a definite match! Alright, toss it into evidence, and be careful! [clatter] [Al] The D.A. may want it for a trial. That is, if these two pizza koombas survive long enough in prison to even make it to court! [Al] Hey, Frank! [Frank] I don't go down for nobody! -[smacking] -[Al] Take it easy, Frank! [Al] Take it easy! Take it easy! [Frank] Al, you know what I found? [Al] What? [Al] I found this pair of Neverlast boxing gloves over these two female corpus delicti! [Al] Alright, good work. Toss it into the evidence! [Frank] Yeah. -[Al] Gentlemen... -[crash] [Al] We've got a little problem. [crunching] -[Debbie] Says who? -[Jane] Says me. -[Debbie] Says you? -[Jane] Oh, yeah! -[Debbie] I didn't think so. -[Jane] I think so. -[Jane] Uh-huh. -[Debbie laughs] Hi! Welcome to Trash MTV! This is Debbie Saville. And I'm Jane Plymouth. Michael and Angelo Misery Layleone have been indicted on the brutal double murder of two gold-digging prostitutes who worked reputedly for the Midnight Madam. -They're current-- -[slam] Currently being held at Maximum Security Federal Butman Prison... [Debbie] ...where-- [Jane] If they can survive the torturous and inhumane treatment that has become synonymous with Butman-- [crack] They will be brought to trail first thing in the morning, in what promises to be the real media circus. [whips cracking] [Jane and Debbie grumbling] [Scheister laughs] It'll be a circus, alright! And they're the clowns! [Scheister laughing] -[Al] Come on, let's go! -[warden] Come here! -[warden] Get over there! -[Al] Get over there! -[warden] Stand back! -[Al] Get moving! [warden] Let's go! Come on! [prisoner yelling] [Al] Alright warden, what do you want to do with these guys? -[Al] The executive suite? -[warden] No. [warden] That's only for VIPs! [warden] These two? [warden] I don't think anybody really cares! [warden and Al chuckle] [warden] Come on! [Al] Hey, warden. [Al] You think she's had enough? [baby whines] [warden] Give her three weeks. [warden] She'll crack. They all crack. [warden] Then, they fry! [warden and Al laughing] [baby whining] [door rattling] -[yelling] -[spitting] [warden] Hey, knock it off, you two! [warden] You're almost home! [Al] Yeah! Home sweet home! [Michael] You don't mean in there? This guy looks hungrier than Jeffrey Dahmer! [warden] He had him for lunch! [Al] A cannibal looking for dessert! No... You two? I've got something really special for you! [Al] You don't mean? [warden and Al] The dryer! [warden and Al laughing] [Michael and Angelo] The dryer? [warden] Come on! This place isn't so bad. Yeah, the rent's free. [clanging] You two boys ready to confess? You a priest? Part-time. -[pop] -[creak] [Michael] Oh, I don't feel so good... [Angelo] Yeah, I'm feeling kind of blue... You got the blues? [jazz playing] [buzz] [rattle] [warden singing] [baby whining] [baby snorts] [intense guitar playing] [baby laughing] [warden] Thank you! Thank you very much! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! Welcome! This is the main event of the evening! [host] Twelve rounds of litigation for the undisputed life or death of the defendants, the Misery brothers! And, fighting out of the defense corner, representing the Public Defenders Office with a horrendous record of zero wins, thirty-seven defeats, and one hung jury, although several jurors did survive! [host] I give you the pride of Pig Bay, Cuba! The one and only Ima Barrister! [applause] [whistling] [host] And now, fighting out of the prosecution corner, this distinguished professional has amassed an amazing record of 74 victories! Sixty by gas chamber, ten by torture, and one be lethal elocution! I give you the one, the only, the incomparable, [host] F. Me Weakly! -[applause] -[trumpets playing] [host] Presiding over the action, this former restaurateur turned judge has presided over some of the most infamous and botched mistrials in history! [gong rings] [host] It is with great pleasure that I give you the ever popular, crowd-pleasing people's judge! [host] The one and only Judge Ben E. Hama! [crowd cheering] [Ben shouts] -[clanging] -[Ben] Yaruzo! [Ben shouts] -[banging] -[slicing] House lights! [applause] Alright. Bailiffs, bring in the defendants! [crunch] Ow, my dick! [suspenseful music playing] [Michael and Angelo mumbling] The Misery brothers. There's an argument for birth control! [mumbling continues] [Ben] Will the litigants please approach the bench? [romantic music playing] -[snap] -[Weakly] Ben? [Ben coughs] Yes, um... -[slice] -[Ben] Now... I want a good, clean trial. No hitting below the belt. No book deals. No posturing in the press. -[bang] -This trial will be conducted in this courtroom! -[wobble] -Not under the media! [Ben] Now, any violations of these very simple rules, and I will hold you in contempt. Sanction you. I'll have you maimed and disbarred! Now, am I very clear on this matter? Oh yes, your honor! Crystal. Very well. [romantic music continues] [Ben] Let's try this case! [Ben laughing] -[bonk] -[Weakly] Oh! [Ima] Your honor... [squeaking] Would you please rescind the gag order so brutally imposed on my clients? Uh... Mr. Weakly, do you have any objections? Nah! What do they got to say? Uh... sure. As long as they don't talk too much. Oh, I promise! Thank you. You are so sweet! [whoosh] [kiss] Where's our regular attorney? Yeah, where's Tom Haagendas? Oh, he's not coming. [Michael and Angelo] What? Maybe this will help. [click] -[whip cracking] -[Ima moaning] [Ima] Give it to me! [Ima] Oh, excuse me! My husband and I are trying to work something out. [click] [Ima] Here we go... [Don Frito] Under the post-human revisions of my latest will, your inheritance and everyone that comes with it are hereby frozen... [Michael and Angelo] Frozen? [Don Frito] ...pending the outcome of this trial. [click] [Ima] There ya go. [Michael] Could you give us a moment alone, please? [Angelo] Yeah. [Ima] Sure. What do you think, Mike? The things I'd like to do to her... [Angelo] About our situation! Oh! Well, we could call our cousin, Vinny, but I hear he's doing a sequel. [Angelo] Yeah... Ang. Miss Barrister? [footsteps] [Ima] Yes? [Michael] What do ya charge? [Angelo] And is it easy to get credit? [Ima] Oh, I'm very easy! [Ima] And real cheap! [Ima] I'm provided as a service by the state! [Ima] Absolutely no charge! [Michael] Oh, God bless America! [Angelo] I love this country! [Ben yells] [bang] Are we about ready for opening statements? Persecution ready, your honor! [Ima] Oh yes, your majesty! [Ben] Very well, then. [Ben] Now, in order to speed things up and execute people, I have taken the liberty to personally interview and... [Ben coughs] ...select the jury. Your honor, with all due circumspect, the process of voir dire, or jury erection, is semi-guaranteed under the munificently inadequate constituency of this great state! [Weakly] I feel it would be tragic... -[Ben shouts] -[slam] [Weakly] Oh! ...if I were to continue. I get your point. Great. Well... now it's time to bring in the jury! [Ben laughs] [American anthem plays] [Michael] Oh, that's some jury pool! [Angelo] Very patriotic! Court reporter, if you please! [court reporter chewing] [court reporter grunts] [Ben] Mr. Weakly, you may begin. [Weakly] Thank you, judge! Ladies and gentle-bosoms of the jury! Let's keep abreast of the facts! We put up a strong front! You can't be a hung jury! It's not a matter of tit for tat! You're here today to see that justice is served! That these two bloody-rare murderers are cooked! Well done. These two miserable excuses for human beings brutally killed two of the best pieces of ass that money can buy! I know! [clicking] [Weakly] I was there! In the trenches! Between the sheets! Mono to mono! -[Weakly] Call girl... -[stomp] ...to marine! Our evidence is irresponsible and concealing! We have matching gloves, fingerprints, perpetrators obscene at the scene of the crime! [Angelo] That's very mean! [Weakly] And most crucible to the state of our union, FNA evidence so complex... that I promise you, you will have no idea what the hell it is! So, I explore you! Make your goal line stand! Act like real men! Win one for the unkind! Win one... for the Gipa! Okay. [Angelo] Who's the "Gipa"? Miss Barrister? Present! No, no, sweetheart. [Ben chuckles] Your opening statement. [paper crinkling] [romantic music playing [squeaking] This case is really a lot easier than I look! You have two allegedly dead women... Two allegedly alive suspects... What does it all mean? Have aliens visited us? Is there life after death? [Ima] And if there is, isn't brutally murdering somebody, really just giving them a new life? -[slam] -[Weakly] Objection, your honor! [Weakly] Statement requires thought on the part of the jury! [Ben] Sustained. Miss Barrister... You will refrain from using any statements or questions that require thought. Yes, my lord. [Ima] In closing the cook book, Mr. Weakly states my clients should be deep fried! Hmm? Well... look at these two! [all jurors] Aww! [Ima] Come on! [Ima] Look at how pitiful they are! -[squeaking] -[Ima] How pathetic! Now, I ask you... Who are the real victims in this crime? Is Elvis alive? And do these guys deserve to die? Just because they're... worthless losers? I don't think so. [Ima] Uh-uh. [Ima] Not this time! Mr. Weakly, call your first witness, please. -[slam] -[click] [beeping] Hello, Al? It's F. Me. F. Me! No, "F" you, Al! It's F. Me! Right! Listen! I need you to come down and testify! Okay! I saw a bacteria cell on the chrome bumper of the car! Realizing the occupants of the estate were in a potentially life-threatening situation, my partner, Detective Frank, and I, decided to act! [Al] And we did! [Al] Frank, the occupants of this estate appear to be in a potentially life-threatening situation! [Frank] You know, you're absolutely, positively, 100 percent correct, Al! [Frank] Let me ask you something! [Frank] Should we get a warrant, or should I jump the fence and grab the ledge percolator? I don't think so, Frank! My sentiments, exactly! [tires grinding] [crash] [sirens blaring] And the rest is history! Michael and Angelo, after we roughed them up, basically confessed, and Lieutenant Frank found the gloves! That's it. -[slam] -[Ima] Lieutenant Dente! [Al] Yeah? Call me... [Al] Call me Big Al. [Ima] Big Al... Did you plant the gloves? [Al breathing heavily] [Al] No! No! No further questions. [Weakly] Now, Detective Frank, just like we rehearsed. [Frank] Yeah. [Frank coughs] I heard the "ding-ding". [Frank] The next thing I knew, the gloves... They were on my hands. [ding] They was a perfect... match? Match! -[Weakly] Great. -[Ima] Objection, your honor! Yes, Miss Barrister? The witness is reading from a teleprompter. -[slam] -[Ben] Sidebar! [Michael and Angelo] Sidebar? [gong rings] Banzai! -[Weakly] Banzai! -[Ima] Banzai! [sip] [burp] Your honor, what do you think about the teleprompter issue? The witness reads very badly. [Ima] Hmm... Please continue. As I was saying... Well, I heard the "ding-ding" in the "boom-bing"... Something like that! But the next thing I know, the gloves was in my hands! And they were a perfect match! [Ima] Objection! Ben? Yes, Ima? The witness is being coached. -[slam] -[Ben] Sidebar! I sure am thirsty! [gong rings] Mazel tov! [Weakly] Shalom! [Ima] Break a leg! [burping] [Ima sighs] My lord, what do you think about the coaching issue? [Ben slurring] Coach coaches very badly! I, Euretha San Diago, so solemnly swear the whole truth, and nothing but the whole damn truth, or may the big man upstairs smack my ass down! Okay! [Weakly] Miss San Diego-- -[Euretha] San Diago! -[Weakly] Of course! Eureka, what is your current preoccupation? [Euretha coughs] I am a domestic servient at the estate of the diseased Don Frijole Leone. [Michael] I didn't know we had a maid! [Angelo] No wonder we could eat off the floor! ...committed the gruesome double murders of our dearly beloved! I object! Yeah, me too! [Ben] On what grounds? Shallow. That's very deep, Mike. -[Ben groaning] -[knives clanging] -[Ben shouts] -[bang] [Ben] You may continue, Mr. Weakly. [Weakly] Thank you. As I was saying before I was so rudely interpreted... Tell us everything you saw, or didn't see, on the night in question. -[slam] -[Euretha] Look... Like I said before, I didn't see nothing! I don't know nothing! You don't know nothing? [joyous music playing] [Euretha singing] ♪ She don't know nothing ♪ ♪ There ain't nothing That she's seen ♪ ♪ She don't know nothing ♪ ♪ She's just a maid Doing her job ♪ ♪ These two guys Are really big slobs ♪ ♪ She don't know nothing ♪ ♪ Nothing, nothing at all ♪ ♪ She got her a job Working nine to five ♪ ♪ She's telling you the truth And that's no jive ♪ ♪ Clock strikes five And she don't get paid ♪ ♪ She don't lie around Hanging in the shade ♪ ♪ She don't know nothing ♪ ♪ Nothing, nothing at all ♪ [trumpet playing] [harmonica playing] ♪ Nothing, nothing ♪ ♪ Nothing, nothing ♪ ♪ Nothing, nothing ♪ [Ben laughs] -[slam] -[Ben] Dismissed! As I was saying... I eat breakfast every morning at a donut stand Two hundred yards from the enemy. Ain't that the guy that rear-ended us? The tailgater! [tailgater] ...virtual warzone. You applaud Santiago, yet you despise me for the very comforts I afford you. Did you order Detective Mancini and Lieutenant Al Dente to plant the black gloves? I specifically ordered the men to not touch Miss Santiago. [Ima sighs] Did you order Detective Mancini and Lieutenant Al Dente to plant the black gloves? -[slam] -[Ima] I want the truth! [tailgater] The truth? The truth? You can't handle the truth! Listen, bimbo... We live in a world with walls! Big walls! And sometimes, officers have to crash through them! It's their job! [Ima] Did you order a code glove? No... I did not. Okay. [Michael] Ang... We got problems. Big problems. [Weakly] The state calls FNA expert, wilderness scientist, Newton Gingrich Einstein! [suspenseful music playing] [Ben] Sit down! Mr. Einstein, in someone else's words, please tell us exactly what FNA is. Fart Naturally Anally. It's a 99.9 percent way of misidentifying someone through the genetic fingerprints that each of us leave. Everyone's farts have a unique appearance and personality! -[slam] -[Weakly] Exactly! Now, I'm gonna have our lovely exhibit model bring over that vile vial for your examination. -[Michael] Dirty rat! -[Angelo sighs] [door opens and shuts] [bubbling] [Weakly] Now... Can you scientifically identify the fart in question? I think I can do that. [pop] [sniffing] [lips smacking] -[coughing] -[heaving] [Einstein coughs] Okay! Now that you've had a chance to incompletely recover, can you identify the type of fart, as well as the perpetrators of the fart? The fart in question is of your classic sugar-coated "breakfastas cerealus" cereal. Or, specifically, Story Book Cereal. And it was caused by... ...them! [Michael sighs] -[booing] -[Weakly] Thank you. [Weakly] The persecution rests, your honor. Very good! Excellent case! Miss Barrister? Yes? [Ben] Is there anything else you would like to present to the court, sweetheart? -[romantic music playing] -[Ima] Yeah, um... [Ima] Yeah, um... [Ima] Uh... [Angelo breathing heavily] [Angelo] Oh, oh, oh! -[Michael] What? -[Angelo] Mike! [Angelo] Ooh! -[Angelo] Over there! -[fart] [Angelo] Look! [Michael] Miss Barrister! [Angelo] Miss Barrister, come here! [Michael whispering] Come on! [quiet grumbling] [Ima] Oh, yeah! [Ima, Michael and Angelo] Ooh... break! Your honor... The defense calls the court reporter to the stand as an excellent expert FNA witness. Rejection, your honor! What possible credentials could she have for such an odious and intellectually exhausting area of expertise? [farting] She's acceptable. [Ima] Miss Steno... [clicking] [Susie] Oh, no! You can call me Susie! -[Ima] Susie... -[Susie] Yeah? [Ima] What did you think about the prosecution's case? [Ima] You think it can hold water? [Susie] Like the Titanic! [Ima and Susie chuckle] [Ima] Hey, you think you could tell us what you were just eating? [Susie] Story Book Cereal! It's my favorite cereal! But it does give me just a little... [farting] ...gas. [Susie laughs] Excuse me. [Ima] Based on everything you've heard here today, can you tell the court what is the relevance of that? Well... Everybody knows that Story Book Cereal has a 92 percent sugar content! [Susie] But... the l'acidophilus factor of 3.75, when multiplied by the exponential root of the Pythagorean theory of relativity, can only mean one thing! What? That the FNA sample in question could not possibly have come from Story Book Cereal! [Susie] Now, you see, an odor of this magnitude from one fiber source, and one fiber source only! [Susie] "Burritus mexicanus." [Ima] Ah! [Susie] That is, of course, a burrito. [Susie chuckles] [Ima] Ha! [Ima] And in taking notes during the deposition of Michael and Angelo Misery Layleone, what did they state they had for breakfast? Could it have been the incriminating burrito? [music crescendo] [Susie] No, it was not! [Ima] No? [banging] What was it then? What could it have been? [triumphant music playing] Story Book Cereal! [jurors at once] Ahh! No further questions. The defense rests. -[lullaby playing] -[snoring] [cheering] And now, ladies and gentlemen... Here is your decision! [host] All nine jurors score the bout exactly the same! [host] In favor of the winner by unanimous decision! [host] The new litigating champion of the world, Ima Barrister! [loud applause] [Ben laughing] [knives clanging] [Ben grunts] [laughing continues] Justice is served! Yes! -[shouting] -[clapping] [Michael] That was some moment, Ang! When we heard the proclamation of our emancipation... [Michael giggling] -[Angelo] Oh, yeah! -[Michael] That was something! [Angelo] And then, when he said we were free to go! -[Michael laughing] -[Angelo] It touched me! [Angelo] Hey, it moved me! [car engine running] [door opens] [clatter] -[whoosh] -[crash] [door shuts] [Joyce] Let me introduce myself. [Joyce] I'm Doctor Joyce Brothers! -[Angelo] Hey. -[Joyce] Hi! [Michael] Too bad you didn't get here earlier, doc. [Angelo] Yeah! The guy they just took away? [Angelo] He really could have used you! [Joyce] Oh, I'm not that kind of a doctor! I'm a psychologist! [Joyce] I listen to people tell-- [Michael] Oh... Stories? I guess you could say that, yes. Doc, did you come to the right place! She sure did! [Joyce] Uh-oh... [chicken] Oh no! Not again! -[gulp] -[burp] [ending music playing]
