Since the dawn of time, the "Gods of the Dragon" and the "Gods of Darkness" have been fighting each other. The Gods of Darkness have the power to destroy humanity in an instant. However, that power was sealed by the descendants of the Dragon Gods. ~ NINJA RYUKENDEN ~ The Legend of the Dragon Sword Ryu! What are you still doing here? You don't need to stay late. Did something happen? But ... are you hurt ?! It's nothing. I felt ... ... are you thinking of coming to my birthday party? Look, I've booked the restaurant! I'm sorry but I can not. You already confirmed a while ago ... I will come next time. But you promised ... I just can't understand what Ryu's feelings are. It's just a birthday party ... You don't have to take it seriously Irene. But... Come on, don't make that face. Try to think of something else! You know I'm not capable ... You're having too much trouble, trust me. You're in love with Ryu, am I right? So what are you waiting for? Go to him and say it to his face! If it scares you, I can do it for you. I will ask Robert to find out what his feelings are for you. Now I salute you, I have to go. ~ Sturgeon & Hammond ~ INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY It is better not to get in the way. At this rate they will get old if one of them does not step forward first! You're nosy as usual. You have a habit of putting your nose into matters that don't concern you. Wasn't it you who told me you liked this curious nature of mine, Mister Detective? I also seem to remember something similar, Robert! Well said, Jeff! I just asked you to test the waters ... After all, you are friends, aren't you? Ah, I was here. Hello everyone! Sara, the boss is looking for you! He needs your support. Was he referring to this? What is it about? The genius of bio-technology and founder of the "Friedman Corporation" ... ... Ned Friedman announces a cure for cancer with no side effects. A joint press conference will be held. I have to beat the other reporters on time. I don't want to write a trivial article. So what should I tell the boss? I've got it! I'll try to ask him for a private interview. I already have a couple of questions in mind ... See you, Robert! Take care of Irene for me. Hey, do you think ...?! You never get on with a woman! Hurry and open the gates! Why are they taking so long? We are late... Here we go! It was about time, finally ... Professor Friedman! We want your comment ... Please tell us something! Is this "cure for cancer" real? Are there really no side effects? Professor ... Professor Friedman! Professor, tell us something ... Professor Friedman! Does this cure really work? Can you confirm the news? Help me! Someone ... Someone help me! I beg you! Get me out of here! Tails... Did you say tails? I have to buy you a drink again. Don't be mad ... Hey, bartender! Also tonight Robert will take care of paying the bill. Sorry for the wait! Hey! I'll have the usual. - I haven't talked to Ryu yet ... - It's not about that. I found something interesting ... ... about Ned Friedman. Were you able to interview him? They bounced me out. I heard he didn't say a single word at the conference . After all, we are talking about Ned Friedman! That man likes to brag to the media about his supposed scientific achievements. Don't you think there's something else underneath? There are a lot of rumors about him ... What do you mean? Would you do me a little favor? What are these "rumors"? Experiments on human guinea pigs. You must be joking ... Eerie screams come from his villa and there is always strange boxes coming and going. But they are only neighborhood rumors. And are we going to such a place? Yep, you could say that! Can we get in? No, unfortunately it is locked. Why did it open? Who knows if anyone lives here ... See, it's like I told you! We can go home. I'm sure "that little genius" ... ... will be resting comfortably in his company headquarters. What you heard were just rumors. Am I right, Robert? This place is a real mess ... Who could have done such a thing? What if the screams were from Ned? It seems to be long dead ... If so, who would have discovered the cure for cancer in Ned Friedman's place? After all, he didn't say a word at the press conference. What if it was a double? What an absurd speech ... Let's split up. Remember we're working, Jeff! Make sure you check every corner. Are we sure anyone heard those screams? What if it's Ned's ghost screams? We'd be in a lot of trouble ... So, you want to call the "Ghostbusters"? Not funny at all ... These corridors are connected. Sara, stay back! Robert?! Ryu, it's you. Ryu! Why are you wearing those clothes? Robert, why are you here? I'm helping Sara. There are some rumors about Ned Friedman. What rumors? He appears to be conducting bio-technological experiments ... ... on human guinea pigs. Bio-technology? Jeff! Jeff, where are you? Jeff! That way. Jeff, are you okay? Ryu... Robert... Jeff! Look... Is he dead? Probably. Sara, give me the camera! The rumors were well founded ... Human experiments. I once heard that the Friedman Corporation was researching biological weapons ... Was it this? Why do such a thing? Did he give him the brain time? You're making too much noise! Make sure you calm down, Jeff. I'm calm... This is a sensational scoop! Hey! What are you doing? I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to publish such an article. You are making a fool of me? Why should I listen to you? Stay out of this business. For what reason? - You better not know anything. - I know what risks my job entails! I repeat ... Do not publish any articles. For once I had a scoop in my hands ... What are you hiding from me? Come on, spit it out. Someone is trying to break the seal of the Gods of Darkness, aren't they? And that someone ... ... that's Ned Friedman, right? Your silence ... ... confirms my assumptions. We will defeat Jakyo, once and for all. Too many people want to seize the power of the Gods of Darkness. When I was in the "Special Forces" ... ... Jakyo tried to break the seal of the Gods of Darkness. I was ordered to stop him. At the time, I didn't believe in the Gods of Darkness. It was then ... ... that the "Dragon Ninja" made his appearance. So, I decided to leave the army ... ... to fight by your side against anyone who wants to awaken the Gods of Darkness! Ryu! Do you still insist on not telling me anything ?! Try to understand, Robert ... This is my destiny as a Dragon Ninja. Nobody will die because of me. Whether it's you, Sara, or Jeffrey ... ... or Irene! Ryu! Professor Bucky-Wise, let's get down to business ... I need some news on Ned Friedman. Ned Friedman, you say? Haven't seen him since college. 20 years have passed, but I confess we have never been on excellent terms. Already in those days, he considered himself a genius. He didn't stoop to talk to people like me. Anyway, would you like some more coffee? No, I'm fine. I see... I'm the one who should start drinking a little less. So what were we talking about? Oh, right... of Ned Friedman. To be honest, I never liked him. More than once, I thought he was out of his mind ... He exclaimed phrases like: "I will become the Messiah of the whole world, with my bio-technology!" But there is more ... He always kept saying that he needed "some kind of power". In the end, he succeeded. If he truly defeated cancer, he became something of a messiah. As is well known, the line between genius and madness is quite fine! Although, in his case I still believe it was more of a madness. And then... I thank you infinitely. It was a great help to me! Do you have to leave already? You can stay if you like. It's been a while since a woman came to visit me. We have enough material ... We apologise for the disturbance. Come back and see me ... Next time, no bodyguards. What's wrong with the old man? I guess he was the one out of his mind! "Some kind of power" ... Such as? It seems clear to me who our opponent is. Thanks a lot! Did you say something? - Today, we close earlier. - Good! - Irene ... - Tell me! You said you had a friend who lives far from here, right? That's right, he lives in Utah. Why do you ask me that? Oh look ... Where did you come from? Are you lost? Or are you a stray? What's wrong? Come on, don't be afraid. Irene, take cover! Ryu! Ryu! Irene! Irene! Irene! Irene... Irene! Let's break in! Stop! This one is already dead. Please stay far away from me. I can't make you happy. Irene... I don't want to involve you in this battle. I never thought it would end like this ... I was hoping the two of us could be together forever. I will continue to wait for you ... ... until the day you return to me. Believe me! - Come on! - Hurry up, Robert. He is waiting for us at his apartment. I know, well! What a temper ... There she is. Irene! Run away, Irene! Jump in! What will those damned people want? There is no time for explanations! Shit... If I had imagined such a situation, I would have bought a Porsche or something similar! You couldn't afford it. Any car would be faster than this ... Are you all okay? I'm alright. All in one piece, I think ... Save me, Jeff ... Idiots! Jeff! I know where they are headed! I believe everything you've told me. Ned Friedman kidnapped Irene, to set a trap for Ryu. Pick whichever one you prefer. You know how to use them, right? Jeff, you don't want to... This is the only solution. Irene has been kidnapped and we know where they keep her prisoner. I'll take this ... I'd rather play it safe. - Jeff, do you want to come too? - Of course! Irene is part of the family. I want to come, too! It's too dangerous, Sara. This is a war ... We don't know if we'll be back safe and sound. Don't try to stop me! I don't intend to abandon Irene. You men don't have a monopoly on friendship! Leave it to us! You're just gonna get in the way with that skirt. Say you love my nerve, huh ?! Make sure you don't get killed. Let's get busy, partner! I hope you get here as soon as possible. Who knows what he'll do when he sees you with me. I have waited a long time for this moment. Jeff! Robert! Oh, but look ... Your friends seem to be looking forward to dying. - Here we go! - Power! Damn bastard! - Jeff, where are you? - Everything is already set here! Blow it up! We have made a clean sweep. Well, let's get moving! What's wrong with you, Jeff? I tremble with desire ... Jeff... My blood burns with the desire to fight! It's the blood of a demon. Once, I was a mercenary ... After I quit, I returned home hoping to live like an ordinary man. So, I put on the coward's mask. I thought I succeeded. Look at me now ... I haven't been so happy for a long time! I feel so elated to be back on the battlefield that I am shaking. Those like us are like that. We like to fight, we like to get drunk ... ... and we like women! Some prefer men. We try to solve problems and survive this world. It's not you who is weird. Let's get rid of these idiots and go have a drink! You said it! Can you hear me? Who are you? Save me, please! Where are you? I have no idea... It's cold here and it's all dark. You're inside the building, aren't you? Hurry up, come and save me! Listen carefully ... Keep talking to me. This way, I will be able to find you. Save me! "Everyone dies sooner or later." Hey! Do these machines have anything to do with the production of biological weapons? The president said they were to create a superhuman race ... "Superhuman", did you say? These monstrous creatures? Don't talk nonsense! How do they work? Observe ... The genes of the 1st and 2nd experimental subject are encoded and added to the human DNA. Does it all depend on it? Well, you can go. Get out! Ryu! Damn you, Dragon Ninja! After all the efforts I've made to create the Gene Enhancement Device ... Why can't you understand the meaning of human evolution? It does not matter. I can replicate the device, to my liking ... ... as long as I have this power with me. Which side? Get down! Jeff, do you want the shotgun? That rifle of yours ... Watch out! Jeff! Damn bastard! Do you feel OK? Are you joking? Do not worry about me... You must continue! I'll take care of slowing them down. See you at the bar. You got it. Ryu! Irene ... Why are you here? Be careful, he's armed! You're finally here, Dragon Ninja. Cursed... But is that ...? You recognize it, don't you? It is the power of the Gods of Darkness that I was able to replicate ... Replicate? What nonsense! When you fought Jakyo ... ... I recorded the power source of the Gods of Darkness. This is the result of those experiments. Along with the superhuman power-up device, which you destroyed earlier. Don't you care if Miss Lu dies? Robert! Oh, you here too? Defeated by a simple human being ... I have to alter the upgrade program to make my creatures better soldiers. Damn bastard, you dare to conduct your crazy experiments? Calm down, there's a girl in ... You did a great job, Ned ... But you're no longer of any use to me. Professor Bucky-Wise?! Ryu! Are you OK? And now back to us, Dragon Ninja ... How about settling the score with an old acquaintance of yours? I have no idea who you are! Can you feel the darkness that dwells within me? What are you babbling about? It is I who have recorded the source of the power of the Gods of Darkness. I have granted Ned the privilege of using my research. He was never a fool. Having tasted this power, he was delighted to collaborate with me. Without a doubt, I think having kidnapped your daughter influenced the decision ... So was it your daughter who called me? She is "our" beautiful daughter. Katherine... Katherine, come here! Let her go. He was under the illusion that he had finished his research, replicating the power of the Gods of Darkness ... ... but this energy is only a surrogate. To permanently break the seal, there is one last thing that needs to be done. It can not be... The Gods of Darkness! That's right ... A fragment of the Gods of Darkness. When the Dark Monarch was sealed by the Dragon Ninja ... ... his body was cut into pieces, but we kept the fragments. Taken individually, they are useless. But by reuniting the body of the High Monarch to the original power of the Gods of Darkness ... ... you get the key to break the seal! We just have to quell the grudges and settle our differences. But I'm afraid I know how it will turn out ... I'm not afraid of the Dragon Ninja's duty. The only thing that matters ... is Irene! Ryu... Stop being melodramatic ... You're just making a fool of yourself! As long as you exist ... ... as long as this evil power exists ... ... for me and Irene there will be no future. For this I will defeat you! Your every effort is useless ... The seal will be broken anyway! Take cover! No, I want to come too! Stay here where it's safe. Damn it ... Stop moving! Stop! Ryu! What kind of ... Hey, Irene! Irene! Irene... Irene... Ryu! Ryu! Ryu?! Ryu! Irene... Ryu! Sara, there is no need to get angry ... Hey, Sara! Let's go have a nice drink! Sara... You had to take me with you! Sara... I'm alive! Why don't we get married? Marry me! Wait a minute, Robert ... Do you realize where we are? We are a stone's throw from a church. Give me a big smile, Sara! Don't you dare to shoot ... It will be a wonderful souvenir photo!
