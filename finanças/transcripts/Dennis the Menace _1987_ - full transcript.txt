Not so fast. The dinosaurs aren't going anywhere. Here, let me help you with that. Thank you, Alice. A nice, quiet day at the Museum. That's what I said. Wow. He should have crushed after every meal. Slow down. No. Look at all these phones. What's this one called? Dad. It's an alasaurus. Aliceaurus, did you hear that, mom? They named that one after you. No, sweetheart, not Allosaurus. It's Allosaurus A-L-L-O-S-A-U-R-U-S. Honey, look at this. It says unearthed by Dr. Barkley. Skyler III. Barkley, I don't believe it. Who is that? The man who discovered this dinosaur? I went to College with him. Do you know him? Sure do. Or did. He was a fraternity brother who ever thought that one day Barkley would become a famous paleontologist? He did. I'm sure. This thing doesn't have any skin. What's? Holding it together? Crazy glue, son. You mustn't climb onto the exhibit. Dennis, what am I going to do with you? I've told you, we don't touch the exhibits. I was just trying to figure out what holds it together. It's held together by specially designed pins like this one? Yes, just. Dennis, we're leaving. I don't have to get abusive. Dad. Always say someday. Look back and laugh. Can we do that now. Henry? I can't find your other Brown Argyle. Any idea where it might be? I was wearing them both yesterday. I guess the sock monster got it. So he can get your smell in case we ever have to track you down. That was thoughtful of you, son. Eat your breakfast, sweetheart. Did the contractor drop off the estimate for the sprinkler system? I'm afraid you'd ask that. It's right there in the bulletin board. $375. And that's just for digging the trenches. The pipes and connections are all extra. That's robbery. What was carbon, please. This is grown up talk, Dennis. Why? Every time I have an idea, it's grown up talk, Dennis. Okay. That settles it. I'll just have to forego a little weekend golf and dig the trenches myself. I'm not paying that kind of money for holes in the ground. Especially when we're still paying the Museum for the reconstruction of that dinosaur. Allosaurus. Whatever. Oh, don't forget, I've got the neighborhood Association meeting early this evening. You and Dennis are on your own for dinner. We're having elections tonight. I'm running for chair. Ladies, you can have my share. Mom. Hi, Mr. Wilson. We're here. Good. Stay there and keep that Fleabag Mongol on your side of the fence, too. What are you doing with the lawn motor, Mr. Wilson? Nothing yet. I'm just trying to get the dad blasted thing started. George. Good morning, Henry. George, when are you going to break down and buy a new mower? This one works just fine once it gets started. Hi, dad. Goodbye, Dennis. Good luck, George. Mr. Wilson. Let me try. Mr. Wilson. Aren't you bad? Rough is starting to live on it. Are you kidding? This way. My dad could play golf on Saturday. We'll be heroes if I help you, I'm in fact, first. Next time we play flies and rounders. No problem. Probably engineers. These trenches will have to be dug in such a way as to minimize the number of linear feet a PVC type required. I'll leave that to youthere's. There's only one thing. You have to be real careful not to serve. Mr. Wilson. I don't think he's in a very good mood today before he gets home. Hey, guys, there's something stuck in the ground here. What is it, Dennis? It's some kind of giant bone. Help me pull it out. Wow. Look at the size of this thing. It looks like a prehistoric baseball bat. I bet it's a dinosaur bone. Like I saw a Museum. You could be right. It resembles a tibia of a creature from the Drastic Pyramid. Most likely a campusaurus. Did you hear that, Joey camp thesaurus. Yeah. From the fans. I got to go tell Mr. Wilson you won't be mad anymore when he sees it. Dennis,look what? I just got it's. Bonnie the Bride. She's beautiful and smell French perfume. Yeah, I can't breathe if you were a girl, you'd love it. I'm a girl and I think it's gross. Margaret, nobody is interested.
