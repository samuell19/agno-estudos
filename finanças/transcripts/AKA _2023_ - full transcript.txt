LIBYA SABHA DISTRICT Sonia? Sonia Gautier? Stay still and you'll be home soon. Drop gun! Or she dead! Oh, my god. Thank you. - Yes? - Mr. Secretary, this is Kruger. You should turn on the television. I'll be there in ten minutes. What we know is the explosion took place around 11 p.m., in a room at the Star Hotel, in the heart of the 8th arrondissement. According to initial reports, the explosion seems to be linked to an intervention by RAID forces who are attempting to neutralize a terrorist cell on the verge - of committing an attack. - He's upstairs. Investigators have yet to confirm whether the explosion occurred before or during the assault, but there are reports of multiple casualties. Earlier, we saw first responders removing victims from the scene. Matthieu, we will come back to you at the scene in just a few moments, as we've just received the first statement from the Ministry of the Interior. He includes this picture of the presumed orchestrator of the attack, Moktar Al Tayeb. If you see this individual, you are encouraged to report the information. However, beware, he is armed and extremely dangerous. You need to run a different picture. Yes, exactly. Less focus, less friendly. Of course, we'll take care of this immediately. He has close ties to Islamist movement. I should have told you sooner. I apologize once again, Mr. President. What the hell happened? - Thank you, Hervé. - He wasn't alone. Three of Al Tayeb's accomplices died in the assault. His wife, Imane Al Tayeb, is one of them. Isn't information your job? Do you realize the situation you've put me in? No one knew he was in the country. I'll have every department on my ass. You need to find him and fast. He's in contact with Victor. - Pastore? - Mm-hm. They'll call or see each other. I can have someone in place when it happens. Hold on. I tell you act fast, and you propose we infiltrate Victor Pastore's mob? We're not talking about some small time player. Narcotics tried it three years ago. Took them months, and they lost a guy doing it. I have my resources. I'll have my guy in there in no time. You remember that kid Adam Franco? He's been working for us for 20 years. All right. I need my sleep. ATTACK AT THE STAR HOTEL It's me. Bring him in. TUNISIA SFAX All police forces from Île-de-France have been mobilized to track down the presumed mastermind of the attack. The head of the National Police Forces declared a state of emergency in the capital to facilitate search for the suspect. And finally, we turn towards Libya, we are still without word concerning our colleague, Sonia Gautier. International correspondent and whistleblower. She was taken hostage several weeks ago. by an armed militia in the upper Fezzan region. The terrorists demanded the liberation of 15 of their members detained by French government, and negotiations were about to be settled before coming to an abrupt halt several days ago. Ms. Gautier, as you may recall, is scheduled to speak to the UN a month from now, with regards to her investigation on the Western states' interference in that area of the world. SOLEIL1990 JUST LOGGED IN SOLEIL1990 CREATED A GAME CHAT WITH YOU JOIN Hey, buddy, what's up? Not much, you? So, you're online, but I can't talk, too busy. Tomorrow, after I get off work, you're free? Around four? Yeah, sure. You know what? Let's meet at my place. It's more relaxed. At your house? Yeah. Okay, I'll be there. SURNAME: HAMON Mochaccino with cream and chocolate shavings. Thought you gave up caffeine? I made herbal tea. You'll like it. You heard about the Star Hotel? A little. Who's the guy? Moktar Al Tayeb, a Sudanese warlord. He was a longtime French ally until he switched allegiance about ten years ago. He's become radicalized. Now, he's in contact with the Islamic State in Eastern Africa. We found out he was here. We busted up one of his operations, but he got away from us. We're betting he will strike again soon. Since when do you set up operations in France? Since when do you ask questions? Good. You understand who your next target is. All the details are in here. It's not going to be easy. Moktar knows how to lie low. We've been in Sudan five years looking for him, and he's a slippery one. He has a loyal network throughout Europe. He recently contacted one of his old friends, Victor Pastore. They were partners in a drug ring for 15 years. They became very close. Victor is his daughter's godfather. We know he's helping him hide. You'll infiltrate Pastore's clan. I want you to get close to Victor, get him to trust you. That's how you'll find Al Tayeb. Victor has a crew of about ten guys, not really soldiers. Except for an Albanian former ops guy, who ensures security. He's the one you have to take on if you want to get noticed. That's the last guy who tried to infiltrate his crew. Be careful. Everything else is in the file. I just want to point him out. One of Victor's right-hand men. He supplies the hired help. He's your way in. After that, it's your call. Do I get backup? A small surveillance team. Just Cisko and Mona to cover you. Same MO we used in Chad. What's my cover on this one? There's nothing here. This is where it gets interesting. You need a foolproof identity in order to infiltrate rapidly. Victor will be playing it safe. Can you think of a better cover? Dijon, then jail, the Legion, a few years in Africa, and now you've come home. No need to start it too much. You know it all by heart. When you say "infiltrate rapidly"? Tomorrow. Steep it longer next time. You're on time. Good. All right, come on. You stay quiet, do what we tell you. So, Karim, you missed us, huh? For sure. - You all right? - Yeah. You? I'm good. I'm good. Nobody mentioned a new guy. Who's this? Adam. Jacques told me to come by, just in case. In case what? In case I'm short one shit for brains to take a beating for me? If it pays well. If it pays well. Gentlemen. Weapons, phones, photo ID. You fill out this information sheet. Address, cell phone number, shoe size, clothes size, and your blood type. When it comes to that last one, don't write anything stupid. Karim, you good? Nothing's changed since winter? - No, all good. - Glad to hear it. Writing's not really your things. I'm gonna see Vic. Come on, this way. You'll meet the team. All good, Hélène? Don't you have school? No, I have a four-hour break, so I'll just study here. These are the new guys. Karim and... What's your name again? Adam. All right, guys, around here, the rules are simple. Do what we tell you when we tell you. You get your paycheck, and everybody's happy. Keep in mind, Victor hates suck-ups. And watch yourselves, people have short fuses around here. Hey, Uncle Youss! Uncle Youss! Look what I can do. - Joe, damn it! You did it again! - Did you see? I'm trying to rest here! Get out of the pool! Karim, you remember Manu? He takes care of making the neighborhood rounds now. You'll be with him. Adam, you'll stay here for the time being. Hey, dickheads, Adam. Adam, the dickheads. Hey, guys, it's 10 after 2:00. Time to get your asses in gear, isn't it? Yep. JB, you should be on the roof. Why aren't you? Oh, no, Youss, today, there's no way. I threw my back out again last night. I can't. What? I'm not kidding. I can barely move. Ask Pee Wee, I can't even tie my shoes. Manu, take the new guy, go to the job site. - Come on, I just washed my jeans. - I don't wanna hear it. JB, Karim, you two come with me, we gotta meet someone in the 13th. Meet me at the car in 15 minutes. You lazy little bitch. No, bro, legit. I can't. My back really hurts. Yeah? So do my balls. That's really the best he could do? Yes, sir. That's it. Forty thousand is a very good offer. You think so? Yeah, come in. Yeah, Victor, I was hoping to leave early today, because I have my son this weekend. I wanna take him somewhere for a few days. This is really bad timing, Jacq. I know, I know, but this year's been really tough with the divorce and all. It's important for his morale. I brought in two more guys for you while I'm gone. One is Karim, you know him. And Adam, you'll like him. Ten years in the Legion, just home from Africa, he's a beast. And Youssef, what does he think? You know Youssef, if you agree, he agrees. Okay. Appreciate it. So, the Milord... First, I gotta do the dirty work, and now this guy gets to take off in the middle of the day? I hope he had time to tell you why you're here. All he told me was Victor's worried about his security. Hey! What'd you mean by that? Why? Did I strike a nerve? Oh, here we go. Don't push it. Yeah. Because I'm the one in charge of his security. That must be why. Whoa! What the hell is wrong with you? Do you want to get killed on your first day, huh? Hey! Where do you think you are? - I apologize, Mr. Pastore. - This is my house. This isn't the jungle. Understood? Now, go shake it off. Come back when you've calmed down. Sorry, Vic, I was supposed to go with Bogdan, what do I do now? Just take him with you instead. You can get him up to speed on Amet. And get Bogdan into the house. You've gotta be shitting me. I did everything you asked me to. You okay? Dad! Fill me in on Amet. He's a pain in the ass from Aulnay. He thinks he's a big deal, because he's got Chechen blood and the big squad. He overstepped. He's been playing on our turf for six months, but Vic's had enough. Two weeks ago, there was an incident, and they lit up the neighborhood. Yeah, I saw a car earlier. They'll shoot people in the back and not give a shit. The bastards are equipped up the ass. Good to know. Where are we headed now? We're going to see the banker. Don't touch my cut, okay? Have him send his guys over. I don't give a shit. Right. It's always the same with you. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Whatever. Yeah, you too. Bye. Pee Wee. Good to see you. Have a seat. You want water? Coffee? Herbal tea? You seem a little tensed. Mm-mm. Give me the plans, and we're out of here. Uh, okay. There's just been a little delay with the plans, but no worries. What delay? Yesterday, you told me we're good to go. "Yesterday." But, uh, since then, something's come up, nothing major. In five days, I'll have you in on something even better. Golden. For the same price, too. Victor will love it, I'm telling you. No, no, no, you don't get it. I came over here to get the plans for tomorrow. And I'm leaving here with the plans for tomorrow. You're the one who doesn't get it. There's no more plans. Yeah? Okay. And now, still no plans? Seriously? You're pulling a gun on me? What's the problem? Okay, Pee Wee, I'll tell you what's the problem. I owe these guys one fucking huge debt. I had to give them the scoop. These things happen. Your fucking debt is not my problem. Size matters, wouldn't you say, asshole, huh? I'm not leaving without those plans, I told you. Then you won't be leaving at all. What are you going to do, huh? Huh? - Son of a bitch! You're breaking my arm! - Where are the plans? No, that's the wrist. Bastard! You broke my wrist! - Where are the plans? - In there, in the drawer. Let me go! They're right here. So there you go. Not so complicated, was it? All you need to do now is call your buddies, and tell them in five days, it's all good. Yeah, that's what I'll do. Fuck. FRANCE IN THE SHADOW OF TERRORISM - They're out of bacon. - Shit. Hm, we got the info on the guy they went to see this afternoon. Several stints in prison for fencing, accomplice to robbery, and organized theft. He's a small player. No ties with Moktar or the other cells. Okay, let's forget him. That's Victor's line. UNKNOWN NUMBER INCOMING CALL Hello? Hello, brother. Hold on. Fucking scramblers. Hello? Hello, brother. Hello, brother. Hello, brother. Hello, brother. RUNNING ANALYSIS ANALYSIS COMPLETE It's him. Franco has to bug Victor's office. We need to hear everything. REFERENCE VOCAL SIGNATURE AL TAYEB Yeah, I know it's tough. Look, I promised I'll be there. I told you I was gonna be there. I didn't get everything on time. - Here you go. - Thanks. Hello. Sit here. He's clear. Hello, my brother. Hello, Yacine. I'm sorry for your loss. We started the process as you told us. But there's a lot of stuff to transport. The Egyptian accepted to work with us. Now, he wants money. But I vouched for you. He said he can wait for the payment. Thank you. You're truly a brother. No joke, man, you ruptured my eardrum with that crazy move back there. So, this is Adam. - Really? - How are you doing, Michelle? - I thought you'd be bigger. - Oh, relax, he's cool. Bogdan kinda asked for it. Their stuff is really high quality. - I'll check it out. - Sorry, I'm late. - You good, Mimi? - Yeah, honey, you? - Same. - Great. You guys have a good night. - Thanks, you too. - Hey. Hi, Pee Wee. Hey, Stacy, how's it going? Camel, can I get two scotch? Come on, girls. Get moving. - Twenty minutes. - Could you help me with my costume? Bottom's up to your special skills. Come on. Let's go, please! Again. It's good vibe, huh? Tonight, we relax and have a good time. Hey, forget about Victor earlier. He's a little stressed out these days. He can't help it. Because of Amet or something else? Amet's not helping, but there's other stuff. Hey, Pee Wee! What's up? - Hey, man, it's good to see you. Yeah. - All good? ...for Stacy, who'll be back on the pole in half an hour. Sara, I need you to entertain some real customers. If you don't mind. - Everything okay, gentlemen? - Perfect. Sorry, darling, you need to get yourself ready. Your dick goes anywhere but there. Private property. Not one finger on her. I'll get us another one. - I'm telling you... - Hello, ladies. Yeah! Can't let you in tonight, guys. You serious? We're not here to stir shit up. We just wanna fuck the pretty girls. You're done. Victor doesn't want you here. What do you want? If it's a tip, say so. Huh? - Hey, hey, leave the girls alone. - Hey, I was talking to you. - Get lost, I said. - We're gonna kick your ass! - Get off! - Hey! Carlala! Hey, Amet's guys are beating the shit out of Sofiane. Come on, Pee Wee, move! MILORD Thanks for protecting us. It's my job. It's just a scratch. I'm fine. I really need you to take Jonathan to school. Normally, it's Sofiane who takes him when his shift is done. - Okay. - Do you have a car? Yeah, it's just out front. You're an angel. Take this. Keep the pressure on. There are white muscles, which are smooth, and there are red muscles, which are striated. Red muscles are types of muscles that depend on the, uh... - Central... - Central nervous system. And the white muscles depend on the autonomic nervous system. - The autonomic nervous system controls... - I got the files you wanted. Oh, for Christ's sake. Oh, and there was a shit show outside the Milord. Oh, yeah? Soso took a beating from some of Amet's guys. Janusz and his gang. He's at the hospital. He fell and cracked his skull pretty good, broke a few teeth and fractured his jaw. I suppose this is after he told them they're not welcome. We need to put them in their place. If you want. But the guys took care of it already. Don't worry. Took care of it, how? The new guy, Adam. He demolished them. I haven't seen the footage, but apparently, the guy can hit like Tyson Fury. Ooh! What do you want me to do about it? His guys were spending money on my girls long before you got into this pissing contest! Pissing contest? They shot at us last month. They weren't involved in that. It's the same guys, in the same gang. They work for Amet. I don't wanna see a single one of those assholes on my property. - Do you hear me? - But Janusz and his guys, they don't give a shit about your stupid games! But what I give a shit about is they spend five grand a night! Five thousand is what's gonna cost to fix Sofiane's teeth! You always say business comes first. And now you're telling your guys to refuse clients behind my back, too? Stop thinking with your goddamn balls and start using your brain! Do I need to tell you how much you need cash now? Hey, don't you start with that! What do you want, boy? You're almost eight, Jonathan. You're too old for kisses now. Go on. - Did you test the new guy? - Yes. Come here, sweetheart. Don't be sad. - And? - Sofiane doesn't feel good today. So you'll go to school with someone new. His name's Adam, he's very nice. - And? - He knows how to behave! I'm exhausted. I'm going to bed. - I'm not finished. - Well, I am! Watch your tone when you're talking to me! You can pretend you're Escobar all you want, but I'm not your bitch. Without my girls, you have zero cash flow. I think you need boxing lessons. Let's go. My sister said it's only losers who'd get in fights. But I don't totally agree. There's a few kids at school who would shut up if I knew how to fight. Sure. Anyway, are you coming to my birthday tomorrow? Everyone's coming over. It's gonna be super fun! You can even play Wii with us if you want, Wii is my favorite. I like PS4. Yeah, but you can't play Mario on PS4 or Zelda. Even if it's kinda hard, 'cause it's confusing. But the best is Mario Kart. You could have lots of players. Seriously? So where's Sofiane? At the hospital. Joe, I'll take you to school. Come on. But we were talking. - Natalya asked me... - Natalya's judgement is off these days. - Come on. Let's go. - I forgot your name! - Adam. - See you at my party, then, Adam. - Oh, you're getting so big. - Bye! I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? TIME FOR LEVEL 2. YOU'LL GET BUGS AND GPS TRACKERS. DO YOUR THING! Yeah. Hi. Adam Franco? VICTOR WANTS TO SEE YOU. YOUSS Yes. Please, have a seat. First, I want to say thank you for last night at the club. You really stood up for us, the guys told me. That's what you pay me for. I'm glad you brought that up. Yesterday, you worked for free. And today, you're gonna work for free also. Because I had to pay for all of Bogdan's expenses when you nearly busted his larynx. So let's get one thing clear. You don't ever lift a finger against your brothers if you want to stay here. Understood? INVESTIGATION FILE I've had your name running to my head since you got here. Adam Franco. At first, I told myself, "It can't be possibly that same kid." What are the odds you end up sitting right there, right now? How many bullets did you take? - Five. - Five. In close range. That has to leave a few scars, no? No? Is it true that when you pointed at the cops, your rifle was empty? At 15... It takes some brass balls. Welcome to the family. Do you miss being in Africa? - No, I've seen enough. - Where were you? Moved around a lot. DRC, Mali, Tunisia. - And a bit of Sudan. - Sudan? Huh, I know it well. It was beautiful before the war. Very. South America. Ten-year service, you must know. The locals weren't always as sweet as their rum. I can vouch for that. My daughter's mother is Brazilian. Pee Wee told me Amet tried to come after you. I can help you with that. Bogdan is in charge of my security. Mm. You've been here one day. So for now, you'll take over for Sofiane. At least tonight, because I'm sure he can barely stand up right now. Which also means you need to pick up Jonathan at school later. He's out at four. And he has Judo. His bag is in his room. His sister pulled him out of my car earlier. It would probably piss her off. Look, my daughter is a royal pain in the ass, like my wife. I'm not looking to get that kid a new chauffeur. I need a bodyguard. Okay. Good. Now get some rest. Thank you for the drink. STORAGE OF FLAMMABLE PRODUCTS NO SMOKING I can't thank you enough for agreeing. I kept my word. I hope you do the same. Are we clear about the risks? What would you do if you were me? Same as you. This is why I have accepted. Lay low and be ready while my team is taking care of the last preparations. May Allah guide your hand, my brother. INVESTIGATION FILE MISSING CHILD RAPHAËL FRANCO Now, Elliot is in trouble again. What for? - I think he cussed in front of... - Hey, Lila! Why are you talking to that loser? Anyway, what's the difference between a blowjob and a handjob? Wanna guess? Or do you wanna ask your mom? The whore. Hey, leave him alone! Come on, get up. You're such a baby, I swear. - Who is that? - Who is that? Do you know him? Aah! Aah! - I know where you live. - Aah! He broke my nose! Let's go. I think we can both do some boxing classes, huh? Yeah? - Do you really know where he lives? - No. What are you doing here? I told my dad I was his ride. I'm taking you home, Joe. - No! - He has Judo. His stuff is in the car. INVESTIGATION FILE That's not too tight, is it? A little, but you can leave it. Excuse me. Okay. See you tomorrow. Yeah, see you. Don't forget my birthday.

Sweetie, you know how much I hate animals, my mistake marrying one, I guess. - But you said today was my special day. - Listen, I'm really tired. And I need to relax. You have everything you could want here. Don't start acting like a spoiled baby, okay? Is that for me? Why would it be for you? Because today's my birthday? This party's for you? Oh, cool!

Tuck your thumbs in. - I'm going to the zoo later. You coming? - I'm your driver, aren't I? Happy birthday, buddy. Watch the thumbs. Look who I found to play hide-and-seek. Mr. Bogdan.

We're moving out, I'm not sure where... - Is someone here? - Victor. Who the hell is under my desk? Hey, get out here! What are you doing? Shh, Papa, you have to whisper. It's hide-and-seek. Don't call me that, Jonathan! How many times have I told you not to play in here? Did I not make myself clear? - Yeah, but I... - It's my fault. We got carried away. Get lost. Are you an idiot? It won't happen again, sir. Is it bad? Nobody knows about it. - There he is! - We found Joe! He's the seeker now! Go on, the others are waiting for you. We've only got one now. Can you check if it's useable? We're far from the phone, but it should be fine. I told you he'd be mad. Are you in trouble? Yeah, a little. For fuck's sake! I've been looking for you. We gotta roll. I'm really sorry, Joe. I won't be able to take you to the zoo. Yeah, it's me. They're on their way. They should be there in four or five hours. Is that okay? Yeah, start the operation. Tomorrow night, it will be ready. I'm sure. OPERATION? TOMORROW Okay. I will pray for you, my friend. I don't have trackers on the van. Is Franco inside? I'm not sure. Christ, I'll follow them. Manu, tell me again. We go in the main door, if that doesn't work, I flash my badge. Once we're in, I neutralize the guard. And customers... Towards the bathroom, on their knees. Scared of my gun. I cover the main entrance and check the time. I head straight to number five. Smack the cashier with my favorite weapon and bam! "Everybody, hands up! I want Olivier Lopez!" "He has ten seconds to unlock these gates if he wants little Annie to show up at Pierre and Marie Curie's daycare Monday." And, schlack! I take his badge, stuff the employees under the counter, and I stay in guard in front of the door of the safe, and wait. Not bad. But didn't you miss an important detail? No, come on, it's right here, Pee Wee. I didn't forget it. Get me all stressed out. Your turn. I move up front and wait for you. With the motor running. Hey, turn it up, JB. Moktar Al Tayeb, a known terrorist, could be here on French soil, preparing an attack in a suite? And isn't it unusual that no one saw any movement... Who cares? It's always the same story. ...15 minutes after the explosion? Where do you get your information? Last I heard... I give that sucker three more days, tops. He's got every cop in the country on his tail, which is great for us. No shit, he's going down in flames like all the others. What's with you? ...since Moktar Al Tayeb's still at large. Gentlemen, a lively debate... Find something more upbeat. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a robbery! Do what we say and no one gets hurt. THE BANK IS CLOSED FOR MAINTENANCE - I'm parked out front. - Okay. I was hoping Adam can come with us too. He didn't have a choice, I told you. - I don't like things this way. - What way? When everybody acts like I don't exist, like I'm not even here. Hey, Adam isn't your friend, okay? He brought you that punching bag to be nice, but he works for Dad. Yeah, but at least he doesn't pretend. Go, man. We're good. Fucking, eh. I told you, didn't I? Huh? I told you, didn't I? Genius, Pee Wee. That was too much. Motherfucking clockwork, bro. Good job, Adam. You were patient, very cool. I just want a whiff of that money. How much do you think we've got? - Three hundred at least. Come to Daddy. - Three hundred, four, it could even be five! With this, Pee Wee, you can finally get a decent car and get rid of that shit box you've got. Yeah, and you can finally get someone to fix your back. - You wanna whiff of this, taxi-man? - That's a kick-ass fare. I don't think taxi likes the smell of money, guys. Yeah, he only likes the smell of ass-kicking. Speed it up, though, won't ya? I want to get home already. Gimme a rifle Get Pee Wee out. Take care of Pee Wee, I'll cover you! Okay, okay. Come on, come on. Let's move! Take cover! - You all right, bro, huh? - Yeah, I'm good. Adam, behind you! Get us a car! Move now! Go. Manu, you have ammo? Get in! Get in! JB, hurry up! Let's go. Shit! Pee Wee! They got company! I'm going! Come on, Manu! Come on. Pee Wee? Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Adam, come on! Go, go, go! Get down! Fuck. Can I sit up straight now? Oh, I'm sure it's Amet's motherfuckers. Who else would try that shit? Several residents of the neighborhood were caught in a cross fire, two with life-threatening injuries. The police commissioner issued a statement just a few minutes ago. He did not refute a possible link between this altercation and the attack at the Star Hotel that shook up the capital, Saturday night. With Moktar Al Tayeb's still on the run, the commissioner stated that another terrorist attack in the Paris region is highly probable in the coming days... Wait. Who was it? The guy you brought in? Yes, sir. What's going on? Have you decided to ruin your entire career in three days? You're right on track, Kruger. My agents intercepted a call from Moktar. He's preparing another hit. From the sound of it, tomorrow. Does he want revenge or something? Is that why he's still here? - What else? - Nothing. Hm. Franco will find him. I give you my word, sir. I had a conversation with Khartoum this morning. They're losing patience. Because we promised he'd be dead, that's part of the deal. And it was your idea to get him here and assassinate him. Instead, we're looking at a possible attack on French soil, because you failed. If you blow this, they'll trace it back to you and to me. To Sudan. He'll be dead by tomorrow. He'd better be. - They followed you? - No, they were waiting. They cut us off. Someone told him the route. Youssef, hand out the shares. Bogdan. Go see the banker and get answer from the son of a bitch. Here. Give Manu his cut, too. Go on. I suggest you get far away from here. Leave with Jonathan tonight if you can. What the hell are you talking about? If I know, then Victor will figure it out, too. Fucking hell. Be very careful with what you're about to say to me. Did you try to screw me? What? No. Half wasn't enough for you? Of course, it is. What are you talking about? The new bouncer you'd brought in, you didn't tell us he'd be there. Who is he? You get your new guys from special forces now? Adam? I didn't know. He works for Victor. How could I know he would be there today? You promised me this thing's rock solid. All we had to do was ambush them and get the money. But your new guy, whatever the fuck his name is, he's lit my guys up, he's gonna pay. And you're gonna pay for it too. Please, I swear to God, I had no idea. I didn't know anything about it, you have to believe me. I don't have to believe a word you say, but now you need to listen. Normally, I'm a very reasonable guy. You know that. But when I don't get what I want, what I'm promised, I start acting like a spoiled little shit. Dad! - I can do really stupid things. - Victor! - I need help! - No, no, no. This afternoon, I was kinda bored, so I went out to get some fresh air. - I went to see the lions at the zoo. - Hélène! I ran into your kids. They're cute. Very polite. I kept the little one with me. He even told me it was his birthday today. - We're gonna have fun. - Mommy! - Mommy, come and get me, Mommy. - Sweetheart. Mommy's coming right away. Everything's fine. - I wanna come home. - Don't worry. You're going to give me my money, Natalya. I'll get in touch with Victor. Then you're going to convince him. Otherwise, I'll do something we'll all regret. Mommy! - Oh, sorry. Don't move. - Forget it, I'll do it myself. Okay? All right, I'll leave you alone then. Who does he think he is? Is he serious? He thinks he's gonna blackmail me? Bogdan, get all our contacts going on this. You find that fucker's mom and bring her in here! - He'll get the message! - You have to pay, Victor. - I'm begging you. - He'll get nothing. We will not pay a ransom. It's a matter of principle. If we show any weakness, we lose all respect. What respect? You really think he respects you? He tried to screw you over today! He kidnapped our son! Enough with that! Victor. Are you all right? Really, Victor? My son's worth nothing because his blood's not yours? You disgust me. You disgust me! Watch yourself, Natalya. Why should I? What are you gonna do? - Enough, Natalya. Calm... - Get your hands off me! Asshole! You're his fucking godfather! Where's Adam? Yeah, Manu? They took my brother. They kidnapped Joe. What do you mean? Amet wants the money, my dad won't pay him. I'm freaking out. Adam? Adam? Are you there? - I'm busy right now. - They'll kill him. Thanks for nothing. Open the trunk. What are you doing? LOCALIZING KARIM'S CAR I'm moving. You keep your eyes on that store. Pee Wee is the link. Potential contact. Franco! - Franco took off. I don't know why. - Shit. Hélène called him five minutes ago. - The boy Jonathan got kidnapped. - What? The guys who ambushed them at the bank are holding the kid for ransom. He's heading south. Should I follow him? Cisko? - Cisko? - Mona, I have contact. Call you back. Al Tayeb! Hands up. Turn around. Step forward. That's far enough. Assan. Assan! We got to go now, cousin. Come on, quickly, let's go! Shit. - Uh, I need some smack. - You have cash? Yeah. What the hell? You stink. Go ahead. That corner left. Then down. Fifty a smack. Is there somewhere to relax? It's rough out there. Where's the kid? Where is the kid? What floor? Fifth floor. He's with Amet. Hey, tell Janusz to get his ass up. Boss wants to see him. Janusz? Come here. Janusz? Where are you? - Amet's looking. - Yeah, okay. I'm coming. Janusz, where are you? Janusz? Janusz? Janusz? Fuck! Move your ass. I don't know, just get people up here. Yeah, it's the guy from the robbery. I don't know, some guy Victor brought in. Go fuck yourself! Stop whining, kid! I'm going to open the door. - Adam! - Shut up, you little shit! Where the hell's Victor? I wanna see Victor! He doesn't know I'm here. Who the fuck are you? Adam! I just wanna go home. It's okay, buddy. It's over. Wait, wait, hold on. We can work it out. Let-let us talk about this. I-I have money. Anything you want. Name your price. Joe! Joe! Thank you. It's okay, Jojo. - Everything's gonna be okay. - Baby, I'm so sorry. You're so brave. I love you so much. Adam? Adam? Can you hear me? Adam? I was told you were ready to die out there. I'm looking for people exactly like you. What would you say to getting a clean slate? To getting a brand-new start somewhere? A brand-new life. A brand-new identity. A brand-new family. Think about it. And bring me Al Tayeb. Adam? Are you okay? You can't go on your own. Adam, take it easy. You have to recover. You lost a lot of blood, remember? I'm not letting you go. This is crazy! This is bullshit. You can barely walk. You wanted your brother, you got him. Now, leave me the hell alone. JASMIN STREET No. He doesn't know anything. He didn't sell us out. Yeah. I'm sure. We have a problem. Whoever talked is one of us. Youssef, drive him home, would you? You look like hell. How'd you know where Joe was? Pee Wee told me about Amet. I went on his turf, I got lucky. You got lucky? How come you didn't call us? Hélène said Victor wouldn't pay the ransom. I'm good to get home on my own. Don't bother. CONTACTS - ALL CONTACTS AURELIE - BÉRÉ - CISKO Hello. You have reached the answering service... Damn it. CONTACT CONFIRMED. DELIVERY UNDER 24H. Come out now. - Keep your hands in the air. - Down, now. On your knees. Put down the weapon. Put it down gently. I'm undercover. Badge number 223-416. Okay, verify that. Just go home. Thank you. - Yeah. - What the fuck is going on? No one's answering at the house Vic lost his shit. He fired the whole crew. I hadn't seen him that bad in a long time. Why the hell he'd do that? I went to have a little chat with the girls at Milord. Now we know who told those assholes about our plans. It was Natalya. She was supposed to get half the take. She's been wanting to leave for a while. - She can't take it with Vic anymore. - Dumb bitch. I hope for her sake, he's in a forgiving mood. Forget that. He's had a few drinks already. It's not looking good. Wanna hear something else? - Adam is a fucking cop. - I knew it. We'll take him out. Call JB. We'll meet outside his place. - Okay. - Fuck. I want you to put an end to it. My guy spotted him. It's a matter of hours. He spotted him? He was right outside my window. Just last night. Watch yourself, Kruger. My patience has its limits. I'm starting to get a tad bit irritated. Take a look at what he left me. What does he want? To scare me, I suppose. Is he planning to leak all the files, is that it? HARDER TO WAIT THAN TO WITHSTAND FIRE You now have access to two commando units from Tactical Ops. You can't imagine how much that's costing me. So as soon as your special agent... MONA: ADAM'S COVER BLOWN, CISKO UNREACHABLE ...has him in sight, call the men to clean up. I want no trace of this. None. Am I perfectly clear? I want every bit of this fucking disaster buried for good! Understood. Hey, guys, I don't know about this. He saved our asses at the ambush. He's an infiltrator, sent in to fuck with us. Fuck with us, how? I'm serious, Youssef. Fuck with us, how? I saw what I saw, JB. Shut your hole. He's the one getting fucked. All I know is we better have one hell of a plan going in. You guys weren't with us. The guy is lethal. There's three of us, one of him. We go in, light him up, and we're out of here! What does she want? Hi, guys. Do you have a light? - Sure, we do, miss. - Thanks. - Wanna smoke? - Thanks, we're good. I'm trying to quit. Hey, Adam. I didn't have a chance to say bye to you yesterday, and... I won't get another one. I wanted to thank you for everything you've done. I won't forget it. You saved my life. And more than that, actually. Thanks to you... Well, you'll never know how... ...big of a thing you did. I would've loved to get to know you better, but it wasn't in the cards, bro. Sorry it doesn't make any sense right now. But I just wanted to say you're one hell of a beast, and bye, buddy. What happened, Mona? I took them out. Victor's guys came for you. I won't make it. I'm sorry. SEARCH COMPLETE Another great move by Bennacer. Oh, and then... Goal! Give me your weapon. What are you preparing? You work for those assholes? And how is my friend Kruger doing? He must be an Army General by now with everything he's stolen from my country. What was the money for? What is the operation? What is the operation? You two, out here! Out, now! To the wall. To the wall! I don't know what they told you, but it's all lies. We're not terrorists, we're not hurting anyone. On your knees, hands on your head. - What's the plan, Pee Wee? - There's no plan, the money was for her! We couldn't go to the hospital. Who is she? My daughter. There was never an attempted attack at the hotel, Adam. They wanted to kill Moktar... What are you doing in France? I was invited by your Minister to discuss a cease-fire in South of Sudan. Everybody thought it was a miracle when you came to South Sudan in the 1980s. The French, helping us gain our freedom. And it worked. We got our independence, thanks to you and the blood of our people. But look at where we are today. Allah warned us, when you make a pact with the devil, he always comes back to get his due. And this is the sad truth. Your masters were only interested in one thing. Not democracy, not peace. No. The only wealth that you could see in our country... was our black gold. I have fought for one thing, and one thing only, the freedom of my people, our right to decide for ourselves, our land, and our resources. And because of this, today, I am a terrorist, when yesterday, I was an ally? And you invite me under diplomatic cover to murder me? You want my life? You want my life? Take it! You've already taken all that I have. My land, my honor, the love of my life. You even took her from me. Her operation was a success. She's gonna live. I just want to say my prayer and say goodbye. You can do what you want with me after that. But she has nothing to do with it. Come here. Come on! Hey, sunshine. I came to say goodbye. I love you so much. You can't imagine. A government agent did this to her. A guy just like you. Was it you? Go, go, go! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm one of you! Here! Men down! Men down! Stay down. Down! Watch out! Pee Wee. Pee Wee! They're gonna send others. This isn't over. Get what she needs. How many are they? I'm not sure, four or five. Maybe more on the roof. There's at least one team surrounding us. We won't make it. You're gonna have to trust me, Pee Wee. Do exactly as I say, okay? In one minute, you crack the door open. You throw this grenade in front of the ambulance. You make a rain bullets, okay? They'll hone in on you. So take cover. - I'm not cut out for this, bro. - Hey, you can do this. Remember why you're here. One minute. Fuck. Pee Wee, go! Move! Move! Move! Get him. Behind the ambulance! In the ambulance! Pee Wee, let's roll! All right, Pee Wee, go! Adam, come on! They're everywhere! Hit it. TERRORIST? THE SHADY TIES BETWEEN MOKTAR AL TAYEB AND MINISTER MARCONNET I'm sorry. Good luck. ASC Social Services, how may I help you? My little brother was brought in two days ago. I'm trying to get a hold of him. His name is Jonathan Pastore. Can you give me your access code, please? - What? - Your access code. They would have given it to you when you were registered with visitation rights. If you're not registered, you'll have to call back in the morning. A counselor will transfer you to visitation. They're close for the day. Can you please tell me how to reach him? He's only eight years old. I understand it's hard. But there's nothing I can do tonight. I'm sorry. Call back tomorrow.
