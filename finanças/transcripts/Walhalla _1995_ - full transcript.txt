Black monkeys! Mr Vroegop. Mr Vroegop. Jesus, she's hot. I'm assuming you'll go straight to Gelsenkirchen. Can you take the Saab? I'll need my own car later today. That's alright, darling. That whole neighbourhood has to come down. The whole neighbourhood? -Yes. A friend of mine lives there. Raymond De Feyter. Nice for him. This is where the alderman wants to introduce urban renewal. In the entire area. -Then we'll give him some money. We'll make him happy. He's never in my brothel. That makes him harder to approach. Approach him via another socialist then. Walhalla, my furniture palace, comes here. And not somewhere else, just because some alderman wants that. Hey Marie, I'll do it in one hit. That worked because Marie caught the ball. Not because you're so good. Did you bring a note, Marie? Do you want it? It's for you. My dad won't mind. He'd give you the entire shop. Hey, Marie. What did you get? -Is that all for me? Mrs Offenberg wants that new diet yogurt. Maybe we should buy a box of it. For things we don't have, we always send Marie to the baboons across the road. They'd better keep their black claws off her. I need one too. Listen Michel. A football team with Negroes... before the match, in a row... National anthem. One shot and they're all gone. Michel, how often have I told you that the dog can't come into the shop? He was chewing the sofa. Marie, take Schweinhund outside. Schweinhund, go with Marie! Stop with the monkey sounds, Michel. How old are you for Christ's sake? It's my evening off and I do what I want. Go find a woman, loser. One like you, I bet. No way. What do you do anyway? -I open my legs for your dad. I think that's enough. Dad! Dad! Come look at Marie. Is it happening again? Mummy is dead. A bit of mummy's with us. You're a bit of mummy. When you look into the mirror, you'll see you have mummy's eyes. Her nose. Her hair. Didn't we see that in the mirror together? You saw it for yourself. We're all a bit of mummy. See that, Marie? That's the road to heaven. To mummy? -Yes. One day we'll go to heaven too. And then we'll see mummy. You have to write the date. What am I going to do with this? I was going to do that. I think Marie would be a better bookkeeper than you. How do I find it again? -I'll find those dockets. Hey, Fred. A beer? -Yes. And? Are you getting used to security work? It's quiet. We walk around a bit. We're patrolling. Like in the jungle. But in the jungle, they didn't have such good beer. I can't live off the business anymore. Michel keeps an eye on it and the little girl helps a bit too. How come the little girl can't talk well? Marie? -Yes. She was in the back of the car. Eight years ago. That's the accident that killed my wife. Marie was ten. She still is, really. We're all crazy about her. Especially Michel. Twins, you know. Honk, honk. You wouldn't want your plumber to sleep with your wife after the job, would you? I'm telling you: "Yes, the negro stinks!" Fellow countrymen... There is only one solution. They all have to go! Take all the negro fruit. The mango, the papaya, the coconut. What's wrong with our apple, our plum, our banana? Do we accept that we have to share our neighbourhood... with all those dirty Moroccans and all the other negro folk? No, no, no! We should have kicked them all out, twenty years ago. We should have kicked all those black apes out! Out with all of them! Michel, bring a crate of beer up when you're finished, ok? Thank you! -You're a fat parasite. Little Marie. Do you like this song? I played a really bad game. Did you earn that many points? No? Who then? Michel, yes? Your brother's very good. I think so too. Honk. Come, Marie. You'd better have a shower now. You have to be clean when you go to the camp. Marie, don't walk around like this. It can make men go wild. Stay low! Stay low! Ass low, dick in the fatherland! The enemy likes to see guys lag behind, Michel. You're the first to be ritually slaughtered by the enemy. And you're the last. Those guys don't eat pigs. Relax! Nice, hiding behind your sister! I prefer to stick my hands under his sister's skirt. Kurt told a good joke. -Guys, guys... Not about the war, please. My father died in Auschwitz. He fell out of a watchtower. Drunk! Come on! Oh excuse me, Mr. Vincke I wanted to talk about the alderman for Environmental Planning. Don't let me stop you. I have plenty of time. When you're finished, I'll be at the bar. You know what's in it for you. -Of course I do. He has plans for the neighbourhood. He wants to improve the social climate. Urban renewal as a weapon against ethnic tension. Can't you... work on him? Since you're in the same party? But he's really serious about it. So are we, Mr Vincke. It's not possible, Gunther. You know how much I'd like to help you. Me at Environmental Planning? -Yes. With all those retards of yours. Parlevliet, Kloosterboer... Hmm? I want a majority in the council. In the council with Kloosterboer? That's politics! Sounds good to me. Don't stand there like a dummy. Come here. Sit down. Do you want it or not? Yes. But the local elections are in 3 months. It's always been a red stronghold. How do you see this happen? Stir things up a bit, Gunther. Make a few things change. Provoke. -Voilà! That seems to be the only thing you guys are capable of. Use that. If it's for the good cause, why not? -No, it's for my cause, the Walhalla. How do you see this in concrete terms, Mr Vroegop? I just can't see it. -I can hardly say it but I will anyway. Make use of existing irritations. Damn it! We don't let the oil run on the street. Ever heard of a bucket? I guess you can let camels piss straight onto the sand. How long have you been living here? -Twelve years. Then you'll never learn. The difference between a kangaroo... and a polar bear. Or what kind of children would a polar bear and a kangaroo have? A coat with pockets. Don't tell her any jokes. She won't get them anyway. A fur coat with pockets, Marie. If you forget, think of Sanne. She's also a fur coat with pockets. Can't Marie go to some institution? Specialists could teach her to speak better. No? Go to your room before I break your legs. Hey, Marie! There are the beauty and the beast. Hey Marie, come swim! We don't allow men and women to swim together. Hey Marie, look at this. There are idiots among Moroccans too. Except they don't shave their head. Marie. I have to go to the toilet. Do you still love your brother a bit? Only that little bit? Rinus Vroegop. -Good day, sir. A beer, please. You're Raymond De Feyter. -Yes. And you have a son. Is he good with his hands? Yes, brown dan in karate. No, I need someone who's good at fretwork. I need a model for my furniture store, the Walhalla. Heard of it? -Yes. Do you think he can make that? -He made the entire canopy. Send him... Nice bar, by the way. Very good. Send him to me and I'll pay him an advance. Can the windows be made of plastic? As long as it looks realistic. You'd know better than me. Yes, it will look realistic. Don't do that, Marie. She always wants to come with me. Fucking whore... If I want to piss on her, she should let me. I can always give you another one. Mr Vincke! Mr Vincke! She's still young. She just came from her mother. Bloody commie. How's Marie? Is she happy with her piano? She plays it all day. Vroegop likes to give her presents. Children like her are always much happier when they're given something. Quiet, Schweinhund! -It's ok, Marie. I think that dog's the only one who's prepared to talk to us. Our pool's been closed. It's under new management. He's got different plans. Right, the Moroccans can't swim anymore. And the more they get bored, the more they cause problems. Now all we need is a leader of your party, Somers. But couldn't I be that, Mr Vroegop? Couldn’t I be the leader of the party? Too risky. First of all, you're a pimp. Secondly, you're a psychopath. A psychopath, Mr Vroegop? Migrant organisations on both sides of the border... have expressed their fears about the social consequences of the pool closure. Karim! ...negative consequences for relations between migrants and non-migrants. We'll discuss this with sociologist Nicholaas Holzappel. But first a bit of music. One... two... three... and then? Four. Four. -Four avocados. Four a-vo-ca-dos. Salama, Marie. That's what you say in Arab when you leave. Salama. No coffee, Raymond? I have to be there at 6:30. See you later. Salama. She wants salad. Do you know who we should get as party leader? Vincke. I'll give him some money. Stupid, fat, scared. Just what voters want. -But he's a socialist. He's not a socialist. Since 10 seconds, he's our party leader. He'll give a speech and say he wants to stay loyal to his traditional voters. And more bullshit like that. About that the movement is the most important thing in politics. And then he'll say something like... For your culture, your struggle, your neighbourhood. For your culture, your struggle, your neighbourhood, your community. For your identity. That's what we're doing it for, comra... friends. That's what I want to work at. Because you... are worth my loyalty a thousand times more... than that corrupt gang at City Hall. I'm right behind you. Charles Vincke, dear friends. Vincke! Vincke! Charge! Or do we have to show you how? I heard the Moroccans had quite a scare. They reacted quite strongly, yes. Mr. Marinus... Mr Marinus... Could I get an autograph? Do you think we'll be promoted this year? What do you think? Thank you. Wait a moment. I've got something for you too. Here. If you hang that over your desk, it will happen this year. It's from Lourdes. -It's beautiful. Mr Marinus... Mr. Vroegop... We're very grateful to you. You saved the club. About that Moroccan community... I'd like to offer them something to show my sympathy. But how about those building permits? Building permits? They're building a minaret. A what? Like a church tower for Moroccans. First, they smoke a water pipe and when they're out of it, they get on top. And then they start screaming. Then they sleep until they're sober, in that little building downstairs. And then it starts all over again. Yes, I'm playing too! Give me that ball! Here! Yes. Marie has the ball! The youngest guy... he's still cute. The other two are becoming real Moroccans. Between his legs! Damn it! Yellow card! No, a red card! He's off! It's my country. If anybody has to leave, it's you. Understood? Tonight at 12 o'clock... our Michel will turn 18. And we have a nice present for him. All arranged by Somers. What's wrong, Michel? Are you afraid? Don't underestimate him. At that age, they've all done it. Right, Michel? You're all strangely built downstairs. With boys, it's very simple. There's something hanging there. With you it's as if it's all folded up. I know enough, Marie. Marie De Feyter... is your name De Feyter too? What a coincidence. Mine is too Nice to meet you. Michel De Feyter. Is it your birthday tomorrow too? And will you get a present? Me too. But I'll already get it tonight. Are you sure Raymond's your father? With him, it came to life if you just looked at it. Go Michel! Go Michel! I think I'm in the wrong spot. Our Father in heaven hallowed be thy name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us to the time of trial, but rescue us from evil. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Enjoy. Our little Michel is a bit angry. I noticed that too. Little Michel. What are we going to do about it? Marie? -Pea war. Come on, laugh, Michel! It's also Marie's birthday. When I was your age, I was just as nervous. Don't worry. With your face, you could always become gay. But you'd have to grow a moustache and wear leather pants with a bum split. I'd castrate you! I'm really a necrophiliac. -What's a necrophiliac? That's with corpses. I thought it was something with blacks. Hey come on, there are children present. And dogs. The little retard... I'll face any storms Heat and bitter cold Nothing can hurt me now Because I love you I'm able to move mountains Can handle any bite or snarl Nobody will be able to stop it Because I love you Careful, it's hot. I used to seem lost in this place Didn't yet know what it would bring me Rich people may be rich Full of madness and of sorrow I'll never envy them Because I love you Fucking hell! What is it? -This! Who did that? -That baboon. Impossible, it wasn't my children. -No, it's never your children! Bastards! Who's gonna pay for that? From your social security, I bet. Fucking people! -Asshole! Baboon! Go have a beer! Ah, the saviour of the country. I can see him as the mayor. I think he'd be too drunk to cut any ribbons. Don't underestimate the man. I think he was with the Socialist Youth movement. They're tough little boy scouts. Stinking dogs! Give me another one. The pig. I can't stand that guy. No, but he does get the votes. -You're right about that. Tension is growing in the neighbourhood. According to the polls we're gaining 10%. Absolutely. If our fatty keeps this up, we'll get 60%, a majority. You'll have your furniture palace, Mr Vroegop. And you'll be the alderman for Environmental Planning. Definitely. You'll have to change how you dress. You can't wear those ties. Tomorrow evening's job... isn't that a job for... How well is it organised? Who are these people? It's well organised and it's a good connection. Where are they from? -From Marseilles. You tell him. Do I look like an amateur? -Yes. Marie plays the piano really well! She taught herself. -You should come play at my place. Do you remember my name, Marie? She thinks you have a funny name. Shit, that's not the correct currency. We can't change it all in one hit. Change it bit by bit. Kiss my ass, camel fucker. What did you say? Did you say something? Did you say something? -No, I'm not saying anything. The armed robbery yesterday, in broad daylight, by two Arab looking men... rouses the emotions in the small community. Mayor Kouwenberg points the finger at local, extreme right-wing politician... and former socialist Charles Vincke. Vincke is said to have suggested there is a connection... Marie, I have to go to the toilet. between the growing number of migrants and this type of serious crime. Polls show a substantial increase... -Have fun! in the number of people who say they'll vote extreme right wing in... next month's elections. GET LOST FUCKING MOROCCANS Your son's friends should get some Dutch lessons. They wouldn't have a problem finding work. Michel has nothing to do with it. He was with me all night. I almost have no cleaning products left. Can I get some from you? LIST 6 FELLOW BELGIANS FIRST Nice poster. Each people got its own part of the world. There's no place in Europe for primitive cultures. Primitive cultures... Arabs had already named the planets when you still thought the Earth was flat. And everybody who disagreed, was sent to the stake by your ayatollah in Rome. Those things cost money. I'll take it off the account. I thought you hated politics. Yes... I hate politics. That's exactly why I'm going into politics. That cesspool is full of profiteers... who give each other our tax money. And to all those black monkeys. -But you never pay any tax. Fred... Fred... Should I pay taxes? Should I pay taxes for... a school system that's pulling our daughters out of the kitchen. Against their nature! -And against their will. Exactly, against their will! They can't even fry an egg, according to the doctor. As if I'm going to pay taxes for all those blacks that are starving to death. Think I'm crazy? For all those unemployed who are too lazy to get off their asses. Unable to work... Underprivileged, that's another one of those words. And I'm also not paying any taxes for retards! Ah, Marie. I think it's your dinner time. -Are you hungry, Marie? Can't she have a roll? That would spoil her appetite. Is there no apple for her? An apple in a bar? -Have a banana! Banana? What banana? That's food for Moroccans. The baboons from across the street love it. Thank you, Marie. You spoil me too much. She plays well, doesn't she? That's often the case with children like her. Like in that movie with... -Dustin Hoffman. But he was autistic and this is more a case of incest, I think. She's got such a sweet face Except her brother looks like a neo-Nazi. He should wear a cap or something next time he picks her up. Those dots have to go in the right place... otherwise you might be saying the opposite. And now smash it. -Me? Come on, we did it yesterday too. But that was at the baboon cemetery. -Dead is dead, come on. See? It's easy. Oh... how did you make the letters like that? It's nothing. -It's not nothing. I couldn't do it. I really want to help... -Let's stick with the plan then. Fine, Mr Vroegop. Why don't you do it yourself? Raymond, Raymond... I can't afford to get blood on my tie. You know what people are like. And there's a lot at stake. For all of us. Yes, but I've never killed anyone. But you told us all these things about your past, in the jungle. People can say anything. Men talking among men... I've seen a lot of blood, but I've never killed anyone. Or maybe a black. I can't even kill a rabbit. I know what you mean. I'm the same. My father... oh! My father did it just like that. No problem at all. You need a certain mentality. But we're talking about Moroccans here. Dirty Moroccans. If there were no laws, I'd kill them all, slaughter them. I'd perform an ethnic cleansing myself. Exterminate them! All of them! Bastards! Everybody will think it was a conflict among Moroccans. Imagine... a killing in our neighbourhood, that would be... I'm counting on you, Raymond. Harder. -No, she'll hear it. A bit longer. -Next time, ok? Honk, honk. And? Did you do it? I didn't get the chance. -That's impossible, Raymond. That's really impossible. They may turn against us. Think of us, our future, your children's future. All three. All three? Jesus. The firing squad. Yes, Marie, the firing squad. See? You show them they can count on you and they pay up right away. Marrying costs money. It always ends up much more expensive than you think, like the last time. Sanne De Feyter. Sounds good. -Yes. Doesn't it? -Yes. De Feyter's derived from English "The Fighter". We're descendants from English mercenaries who... established themselves in Zeelandic Flanders after... some war or other. -You've told me a thousand times. Have I? Do you have a light? There's one problem. Daddy doesn't smoke. Mummy does. Could take a while. No light. Your money or your life. Do you also work for Vroegop? Your money or I'll stab you. Sorry, I thought we were colleagues for a moment. No, ok, wait. Here are the cigarettes. They belong to mummy. And a lighter, also mummy's. And a car key that belongs to daddy. And a gun that also belongs to daddy. And an ashtray that belongs to both of us. Is it real? -No. Hello? He's not responding. Not another child that doesn't talk, I hope. Marie talks better than most people think. I wonder if it's wise to discuss things with Somers or even Michel... in front of her. -But who does she talk to? To the baboons from across the street. At Mickey Mouse level. That's all she's capable of. Unfortunately. Maybe he doesn't respond because it's a little Moroccan. If it had been a little Moroccan... it would have taken a big bite from your banana just now. This time, I'm not going to read the note. I want you to tell me yourself. Trappist. -Trappist? How many bottles? One? More than one? Two? -Six bottles of Trappist. Very good. I'll get them for you. You can't deny that the crime wave in town is largely caused by the baboons... I mean the Moroccans. Don't drink it yourself or you'll walk like this. The pinnacle of integration: a drunk Arab. No, like this. Right, and the boss doesn't like that. Do you know who's the boss here? Exactly, he's the boss here. -I'm a very strict boss. Ok, your brother's waiting for the Trappist. Bye boss! -Bye, Marie! Salama! -Salama, boss. Special delivery. -One Marie and six bottles of Trappist. There's no stamp on her. Take her back. You heard the boss, Marie. Susan, where are you from? Do you feel like some fun? Will you come to the back with me? Raymond, Sanne can come to the back with me, can't she? Right, Raymond? A bit smaller at the top than our previous guest, but she's not a minor. François, the human bra. Raymond, funny! That's good! People need a laugh every now and then, Raymond! RETURN TO MOROCCO -Are you ok? Don't do that, Patriek, she'll fall. Stand straight. You look like the hunchback of the Notre Dame. I don't think it will hold. And Vincke's twice as heavy as Marie. Maybe I should get on too. We should try without anyone on it. Check whether Michel can see. Yes, ok. Come, Marie. Honk, honk. Just keep walking, Michel. Straight ahead. -Patriek! One foot after another. Come here, you. No, that's Marie's brother. The first baboon I'll get my hands on... I'll kick him so hard in his balls that he'll never fuck again. Patriek, I'm designing a new game. It's a safari game. You have to shoot pigmies out of the trees. Mr. Raymond, I don't do it for the money but for our people. Come out, baboons! You'll get a banana! Friends! Friends! Dear friends, we don't want a war. We only want our sons to become good, hard working fathers. We want our daughters to become good mothers. We only want that our elderly... can safely walk the streets at night. Psychopath! -Pardon? Psychopath! -Are you talking to me, sir? Hold this. Did you say that to me? Loser. Go protest against whales. Start a seal nursery, clueless macrobiotic. Now you. That was Arab. I'll teach you soon. You got that from my brothers, didn't you? Never say those words in front of my father. He'll kick you out. Special delivery. Not enough. -Not enough? You're not that heavy. Or you'll go by air mail after a kick you up your butt. When my father's gone, I'm the boss here. And what the boss says... -Goes. Exactly. Here, they're waiting for your groceries. That's starting to look good. Marie can decide where the cars go. Is that daddy? That's Vroegop. Daddy's in a car with Somers. And what does Vroegop do? -He gives daddy a gun. Daddy has to give it to the baboons. But daddy doesn't give any guns to baboons! There she goes again, mum! -Play nice, guys. This isn't working. We want to play hockey and she keeps kicking the ball. Be nice to Marie. She's very nice and she's our guest. She's crazy. She plays with children, but she has breasts already. Whose things are those? Mine. And whose mirror is this? Well, Marie? Mine. She cuts her drugs on it. Who are you making yourself beautiful for? Who? There's a big mirror there. This is the house where I was born. It's in Rabat, the capital of Morocco. This is my eldest brother, Mohammed. He lives in France now. We sometimes visit. Palm trees. And this is the girl I'm going to marry. She'll come here next year. We'll have a very big party. You're invited too, of course. What's wrong for God's sake? Is there something with your lover? Her lover? That baboon from across the road. You have to keep an eye on her. Who knows who puts their hands on her. CLOSED Hey, Marie! Karim has been beaten up. He's in the coma hospital or something. Marie, I have to go to the toilet. Marie. Marie, I have to go to the toilet. Are you looking for someone? Karim. Karim? Which ward is he in? Do you know his last name? Karim from Rabat. The capital of Morocco. Marie, I'm getting fed up with your puppy eyes. Did that baboon make such a big impression on you? I guess he has a much bigger dick than Michel. The riots were mainly directed towards the houses and properties of migrants. The fact that the anti migrant atmosphere escalates this badly... doesn't bode well for tomorrow's election results. It looks like the extreme right wing... is going to win an absolute majority. That road leads to heaven. One day, we'll also go to heaven that way. Then we'll see Karim. What are you singing? The world's on fire I've known that song for so long. You look timid You're troubled and worried You should drink more It helps In a doorway, the shy couple She loves him and he loves her Believe in life and in each other Machos and whores, genocide Someone makes a profit Someone has scored It keeps us busy It keeps us busy Opportunists, shrewd and retarded A gaping whole in my soul The poor poor, close to the end The rich rich, hurray There near that bench Victims of love The most solemn of vows 'Always' and 'never' Isn't that wonderful Love is beautiful Weapons and madness, genocide Someone makes a profit Someone has scored It keeps us busy It keeps us busy Sensible... wise... and busy!
