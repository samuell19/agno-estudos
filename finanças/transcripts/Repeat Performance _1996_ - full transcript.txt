[heavy-metal guitar playing] YOU KNOW THE TREMENDOUSLY POPULAR ROCK BAND NIRVANA-- KURT'S ALBUMS SOLD MILLIONS. HE'D MADE A CAREER OF SINGING ABOUT CONFUSION AND IN DESPERATION COMMITTED SUICIDE. KURT HAD WANTED TO CALL AN ALBUM, "I HATE MYSELF AND I WANT TO DIE." ONE 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL COMMENTED, "IT SEEMS TO ME THAT KURT'S RECENT SUICIDE EXEMPLIFIED THE EMPTINESS THAT MANY IN MY GENERATION FEEL." YOU CAN'T SEEM TO FIND HAPPINESS, YOU CAN'T SEEM TO FIND JOY AND PEACE AND SATISFACTION. THE BIBLE SAYS, "GOD IS LOVE." AND HE LOVES YOU. AND IF YOU FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE-- YOU REMEMBER ONE THING--THAT ALMIGHTY GOD LOVES YOU. AND HE WANTS TO HELP YOU. BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING, THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO BE, IS WILLING, THEN GOD WILL COME AND HELP YOU TO CHANGE YOUR WAY OF LIVING AND THINKING.

(Mr. Harris) SEAN, THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT JESUS FORGAVE THE VERY PEOPLE THAT NAILED HIM TO A CROSS. WHAT CRIME COULD BE WORSE THAN KILLING THE SON OF GOD? SEAN WHAT IS IT? HOW CAN I HELP YOU? WHAT'S REALLY TROUBLING YOU. I'M REALLY IN TROUBLE MR. HARRIS. DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT? I CAN'T. NOT NOW ANYWAY. SEAN, THE BIBLE SAYS THAT IF WE'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG, THE ONLY WAY OUT IS TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. "IF WE SAY WE HAVE NO SIN, WE ARE ONLY FOOLING OURSELVES, BUT IF WE CONFESS OUR SINS-- TO JESUS, HE CAN BE DEPENDED UPON TO FORGIVE US." YOU KNOW MUM LEFT DAD AND I WHEN I WAS 7. SHE TOOK OFF WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I KNOW IT'S STUPID, BUT I OFTEN FEEL LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT. WHY WOULD IT BE? SHE'S NEVER HAD ANY OTHER CHILDREN. YOU THINK THAT'S THE REASON SHE LEFT? I DUNNO. . .

IT'S UP TO YOU. THANKS. THANK YOU. ♪ [light orchestral-- strings & horns] ♪ ♪ ♪ YOU KNOW, SEAN THE CLIFFS WERE ALWAYS MY FAVORITE PLACE WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER. AND SOMETIMES I USED TO RUN OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT JUST TO SCREAM INTO THE WIND. POPPA USED TO TELL ME TO TALK TO GOD OUT THERE. YEAH, HE TOLD ME THAT TOO. OH, THAT'D BE RIGHT. AND DID YOU? YEAH, I DID. AND IT'S ALL CHANGED FOR ME NOW, SHONA. AFTER I PRAYED, EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT. I DON'T KNOW HOW-- IT JUST IS. WHAT ABOUT YOU? DID YOU USED TO PRAY OUT HERE TOO? SOMETIMES. BUT YOU KNOW SEAN, PAPA IS RIGHT. GOD IS LISTENING. YEAH--I'LL BE DOING A LOT MORE PRAYING FROM NOW ON. SO WILL I SEAN. SO WILL I.
