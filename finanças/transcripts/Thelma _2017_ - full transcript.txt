Come on. Hush. It can at the same time be both a particle and a wave, depending on the measuring apparatus we use. - Hi, Mum. - Hi. - Hey, is anything wrong? - No, I'm just at home, reading. I see. We've been trying to call you. Yes, I know, but I was at a lecture. Oh? What lecture? Biology started today. I meant to call you back, but I was too busy. Isn't that in the morning? - What do you mean? - I thought that was at eight. - It's Tuesday morning, right? - Yes. Daddy showed me how to keep track of everything online. - Well, it was moved to six just this week. - OK. But, hey, I'm cooking dinner, so... What are you making? - Just some pasta and stuff. - OK. Right. - But we can talk later. - How about tomorrow? - Sure. - Yes. - OK. We love you. - Love you too. - OK. Bye. - Bye. Hello? Hello? Hey! Can someone call an ambulance? Had it been a while since you ate? No, not really. Had you been drinking? Alcohol? - No, I don't really drink. - Don't really? - No, I don't drink. - You've never experienced it before? No. - Is it epilepsy? - It's too early to tell. - Do you have a family history of epilepsy? - No, not that I know of. I should look at your medical record. Can I call your family doctor back home? No, I'd rather you didn't. I don't want my parents to know about this. They don't have to know. I'll just talk to your doctor. It's up to you if you want to tell them. Well, OK. Could it be serious? The tests don't show anything abnormal. We'll take some more tests later on to exclude certain conditions. Meanwhile, try not to think about it. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, I just wanted to say hello. I was in the reading hall when you had some sort of... - Anyway, I'm Anja. - Thelma. - But... Are you feeling better? - Much better. Great. - Are you also studying chemistry? - No, biology. - Good. OK, maybe I'll see you in maths. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. - It's in here. - Here? Right. But whenever someone mentions it, you... I don't know what you mean. - I remember Sofia and Gunnar's father. - Aksel. Yes. Sofia and I were going to summer camp. He started talking about how fossils were the result of the great flood. You didn't say much, just put an end to the conversation. Marthe's parents too, they... We met Marthe at the mall. Was it last week? - She sends her regards. - That's nice. They're very nice. But they believe the Earth was created 6,000 years ago. At one time, there was this documentary... That's enough, Thelma. Don't make fun of people. I didn't mean to, I just... Don't you agree it's strange? I'm not sure I like this new attitude. What do you mean? A little knowledge doesn't make us better than others. How did life come to be where there was no life? Do you know? No. You talk as if you know everything. I know I don't. - Are you feeling sad? - Yes, a little. Want to sit here a while? What's the matter? I'm sorry, Daddy. I don't know what's wrong with me. Sometimes I think I'm better than others. And I know I'm not. But I can't help it. I'm glad you say so. Anything else? It's just when I see girls with friends and boyfriends, they seem uglier than me. And they say stupid things. I don't know why they... I see you're getting new friends on Facebook. - Yes. - Well? What's the matter? Well, I talk to some of them before lectures and so on, but it stops there. Seems everyone knows a lot of people already. I don't. But they have to get to know you. You're a great person. Thank you. It'll just take some time. We'll call you when we get home. Take care. - See you soon. - Have a nice trip. - Hi! - Hi! How nice to see you! Are you leaving, or... No, I was supposed to meet someone, but it looks like they've left. - Hi. - This is Julie. I'm Julie. Is that just a Coke? Yeah. That's it? Just a Coke? - Yeah. - May I ask why? My family's Christian. - That's how I was raised. - Really? Diehard Christian? I mean, ordinary Christian? - Yeah. - Well, that's cool. Exotic. I just... Because... Honestly, I think that religious faith is a bit odd. "Why?" "Well, because God or Allah..." - Or Santa Claus. - "Santa says that's how it is." "Santa says birth control is wrong. Let's just have 14 kids." "Santa says women must cover their faces." I don't get it. I think it's weird. - Don't you believe in anything? - No. Only stuff that you can explain, that has a scientific explanation. Can you explain how your mobile works? - Right... What do you mean? - Well, how does it work? - It's not just because someone says so. - Well, there are signals, like... What kind of signals? Well, it's not God. I know that for sure. But signals that are like... Help me if I'm completely... But it's in that area, like... radiation. - Radiation! - But it is! That's why it gives you cancer. Radiation, that's the explanation. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi. Sorry for calling so late. - My phone was in silent mode. - OK. - Is everything OK? - Yes. It's just your mother. She gets nervous when you don't answer. Yes, I know. Sorry. She's been feeling very down again. She's in a lot of pain, you know. Where are you? Are you outside? Yes. I've been out with some friends. I had a lot of fun. Right. I'm glad you're having fun. Just be careful. I am. OK. We'll talk tomorrow. I love you. I love you too. Say hello to Mum, and tell her I'm sorry. Yes, I will. OK. Good night. - Good night. Bye. - Bye. Hi. Hi. Thelma? Thelma? Thelma? Do you want to call someone? No, not now. I'm sorry. For what? Don't think about it. Are you tired? Yeah. - Hey. - Yeah? Why did you turn up here last night? Didn't you text me? No, I don't think so. No... Did you know where I live? I must have. I've probably told you. I got pretty drunk yesterday. I hardly remember anything. ...from the extreme value theorem, as this... A simple application of the theorem... I remember how Dad once held my hand over a lit candle. He pulled it away just before I got burned. But it was really painful. Then he said... "Remember, this is what it's like in Hell, all the time." Are you kidding? Are you... Aren't you angry with him? No. Or... It's a long time ago. He's actually very kind. OK! I mean it. He's really nice. I can talk about everything with him. You talk about everything with your dad? Yeah. Shouldn't I? Well, I think I've talked to my dad like... ten times. Shit. He lives abroad. Has loads of kids. Though I'm not sure he likes children. But are you angry with him? I think I was, for a while. But the older I get, the less I feel I need him in my life, so... it's no problem. "Jesus turd"? - No! - No, maybe that doesn't cut it. "Jesus cunt"? The worst what? What do you mean, the worst? The worst thing you can say if you're a Christian, like. If you combine what's holy with what's less holy. "Jesus Sa..." - What did you just say? - "Jesus Sat..." - A little louder. - "Jesus Satan". - Why are you whispering? - "Jesus Satan"! You've got one there as well. I've got them everywhere. - A man? - Yeah. The world's tiniest man. - It's nice. - Thanks. - You OK? - Guess I need practice. You don't have to smoke. We can go inside. - Thank you for inviting me along. - My pleasure. I'm glad you could make it. It's always nice to meet Anja's friends. - Have you been here before? - No, I haven't. It's really beautiful. Let's see... I think it's this way. - Here, have a snack. - What is it? It's one of those food bars. - I don't feel like chocolate. - You haven't eaten. I'm OK. I don't need anything. Hey, why couldn't Daniel come? I broke up with him. - Shit! What happened? - Don't tell Mum. She really liked him. - But are you OK? - I'm fine. Lord, save me from these thoughts. Please, I beg you. Take them away. Lord, save me from these thoughts. Please, I beg you. Take them away. Lord, save me from these thoughts. Please, I beg you. Take them away. - Has it been a long day? - Yes. Do you manage to get some rest when you come home? Yes. Do you make dinner regularly, or do you eat takeaway? I mostly make dinner here. What did you have today? I made vegetable soup today. Do you go shopping down there? Yes. What's the matter, Thelma? Nothing. I can always tell when there's something. I... I... You can always tell me, you know. It's important that you do. I've drunk alcohol. And I'm very sorry I did. How much? Just two beers with some friends. Was that the day you didn't call us until late in the evening? Yes. Right. Maybe it's all right. You're an adult now. Need to make your own experiences. Maybe one beer isn't that bad. Just make sure you don't lose touch with who you are. No. I know. - I won't. - Many people drink too much. It's very easy to lose control. Yes. - I'm so sorry. - It's OK. It's all right, Thelma. Don't worry about it. I'm glad you told me. - Try to get some sleep. - Yes. - OK, we'll talk later. - Yes. Take care. - Bye. - Bye. The power that conquered death Lives on in those who are His The grave is empty, Jesus lives now In honour and in glory Eternally, He has conquered death The grave is empty, Jesus lives now In honour and in glory Eternally, He has conquered death The grave is empty, Jesus lives now - Hello! Come in. - In honour and in glory... Hi. Well, here you go. Sorry, you want something else? - No, it's OK. - You sure? - Yeah. - OK, cool. - Hi. - Hi. - You're drinking? - Yeah. Where have you been? Haven't you seen my messages? Yeah, sorry. It's just been hectic. It slipped my mind. Hey, sorry I had to leave. It was nice. Tell your mum I appreciated it. I will. - Are you OK? - Yeah. Why do you ask? Did you arrive with Kristoffer? Yeah, we came together. OK. Hey! Hey, I'm not having any. - Many of us don't smoke. - She knows that. Sorry, count me out. Take a proper puff. Wow. Shit. - Can you feel anything? - Maybe a bit. Yeah? Like, what? One more time. - Now I feel something. - Yeah? Good. - Yeah. - Yeah? You're hammered. Is this normal? Yeah. Hey! Hello? Hey! They're making fun of you. There's no weed in that cigarette, just tobacco. You know? They're mean. - Yeah. They were kidding. - It got out of hand. Do you think it's funny? No, it's not, but... Oh, shit. - Are you OK? - I'm sorry. The scan we just took rules out the possibility of a tumour. What I'm going to do is refer you to a specialist ward for epilepsy. - OK... - To give you a diagnosis, they must measure your brain activity during a seizure. - What do you mean? - We just need to hospitalise you - to observe you for a few days. - Right. Now, I've got your journal here. It says you had some sort of seizure when you were six years old. It was diagnosed as a nervous breakdown. Are you sure? It says you received neuroleptic medication for about a year, for irregular sleep patterns. - I didn't know that. - You were given Nozinan. Nozinan is a very powerful drug to give a child. Right. Otherwise, there's very little information here. Almost nothing. Well, Dad's a doctor, so he's always taken care of that stuff. - Your father's a doctor? - Yes, a general practitioner. Oh. Well, then, you should ask him about it. - He can probably explain. - OK. Mummy? Yes. No, not now, Thelma. Can't you see he's feeding? Hey! Go downstairs and draw, OK? There. Yes. Mattias? Mattias! Where's Mattias? Have you taken him? You mustn't do that! Where is he? - I don't know. - Tell me where you've put him. Tell me where you've put him, Thelma! You... Thelma? Where have you put him? Hush. Trond! Trond! He's under here. Careful, careful! Yes. We'll try one more round. Open your eyes. Breathe quickly. In and out. Good. Could you close your eyes? Open your eyes again. Breathe more quickly. Breathe in. Feel your lungs expand. Hold your breath. And breathe out. Good. We're ready to do this. In order to provoke a seizure, we have to, as we discussed, try to reach some fairly unpleasant places. If it's too much, just let us know. OK. How do you feel about the upcoming exams? Are you nervous? Yes, quite. It's OK to reply, but you can just shake your head or nod. Think about my questions. Just let your thoughts flow freely. You mentioned that you had a nervous breakdown as a child. When you were six. Do you remember anything about that? Do you remember anything about your parents at the time? It must have been hard for all of you. Yes. No, I don't remember much. You recently moved to the city. Have you made any friends? And what about boys? If this is painful, try not to block it out. Is there someone special? Maybe it's not a boy at all? Close your eyes. Breathe faster now. Faster. Good. Breathe even faster. Hello? Hello? And... now open your eyes. Look into the light. Breathe more rapidly now. Good. I can see you're having difficult thoughts. Don't hold back. Dive in. Go deeper. Breathe faster. Keep breathing. In and out. Lord, save me from these thoughts. Please, I beg you. Take them away. Take them away. Hi, it's Anja. I can't pick up the phone right now, so please leave a message. I'll fast-forward a bit. Look at this. Nothing's happening. If it had been epilepsy, we'd have seen significant spikes. So it's not epilepsy? No, it's not. But what is it? What's happening to me? Well, it seems consistent with what we call psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. OK? These seizures may be a symptom of something else. A physical reaction to mental suppression. - I don't know what you mean. - It might just be due to stress. It could also be some sort of trauma. Many different things. But something caught my attention. I looked at genetic predisposition. Your grandmother has had a fairly extensive history of mental disorders. - Are you telling me I'm mentally ill? - No, it's... - That I'm mad, like Grandma? - No, no. Relax. I can't access her diagnosis. But she's been in hospital for a long time. You probably know more about it than I do. No, I don't know much about it. She died a long time ago. OK. That's strange. It says here that she... She was a patient at Hellersmo in 2016. The point is that you'll be referred to a psychiatrist for diagnosis. - No, that can't be right. - It's true. It says she was still at Hellersmo in the spring of 2016. That's the latest. The point is that you'll be referred to a psychiatrist. You'll have to take a good look at these issues together. Hello? Grandma? It's Thelma. Trond's daughter. Hi, it's Thelma. She's been like this for years. I don't think she even knows we're here. She wasn't always like that. She used to be lucid, but had serious delusions. I still think the drugs she's on are much too strong. What sort of delusions? Well, she was devastated when her husband disappeared like that. - How? - They never found his body. Just the boat. She became obsessed with the idea that it was her fault. Well, so she was very confused. So when she got cancer, she was convinced she'd caused it herself. - What do you mean? - She thought... That she caused things to happen. I told your father that the medication she's on is way too strong. He didn't seem worried. Hi, it's Anja. I can't pick up the phone right now, so please leave a message. ...quite evident. We have n-tuple algebra, true for all values of n. Then we have two- and three-dimensional interpretations... Hi, Thelma. Can't get hold of Anja... Have you heard from her? Vilde, Anja's mum. Something's happened. I've had these seizures. I don't get it. This girl... What? What's happened? A girl is missing. And I just know it's my fault. I can't stop thinking about it. I know it. That it's my fault. Can I come home? Of course you can come home, dear. OK. I know you've spent a lot of money so I wouldn't have to work while I study. I'm sorry it turned out like this. You can take the exam later. Don't worry. So what's the matter? I've had seizures, epileptic seizures. But it's something else. Psychogenic seizures? Yes. A patient of mine was diagnosed with it a few years ago. - OK? - It turned out fine. Drink your tea. Don't worry. It'll be OK. The doctors said it could be stress, but I don't know. I don't get it. Are you OK? Yes. I'm just a little tired. Don't be afraid. We've given you something to help you calm down. We know what's happening to you, Thelma. We'll help you. I have to tell you something. It will be very painful. "Quack!" Mum forgot the washcloth. You have to be good and sit here. I'll be right back. Can you look after this for me? Good boy! Are you up already? You can go back to sleep. Trond! Trond? Mattias! Trond! Where is he? Have you done something to him? Just say it. - Tell me if you have. - I haven't. I can't find him, Trond! Could you look downstairs? He's not up here either. Why aren't you answering me? No! No! No! There's something within you. If you truly desire something, with body and mind, there's something within you that can make it happen. - Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes. Are you awake? Can you sit upright? Open wide. Lift your tongue. I'm sorry. I should never have let you leave. I thought it was over. It hadn't happened since you found God as a child. I'm going to help you. Dear Lord, Heavenly Father, have mercy on me. I have sinned in mind and deed. My heart lusts for evil. Purify my heart and redeem me by the Holy Ghost. Purify my heart and redeem me by the Holy Ghost. Purify my heart and redeem me by the Holy Ghost. Purify my heart and redeem me by the Holy Ghost. Dear Lord, Heavenly Father, have mercy on me. I have sinned in mind and deed. My heart lusts for evil. Purify my heart... I feel angry. I'm angry with you, God. Why are you doing this to me? What do you want? And I feel angry with Dad as well. I'm not worth it. He has to stop. I can't take it any more. Why can't I just be what I am? Why isn't that possible? What about that poor girl? She disappeared. Were you angry with her as well? No. I was in love with her. And she loved me as well, and I... She didn't love you, Thelma. Think about it. Did she like you before you wanted her? Do you think she had a choice? With what's within you? You were probably just lonely. You needed someone. I didn't want her to disappear. No, but deep down, you did. That's how it happens. - Good night. - Good night. This is no use. We have to stop fooling ourselves. What if she does it again? You'll never be able to forgive yourself. Hey... You're such a good man. You're so kind. But this is about something much greater than us. We're being tested. And you said so yourself. If this doesn't work, then we have to take the consequences. No matter how painful it is. Or how much we love her. You've done everything you can. And we'll all meet again. - Hi, Trond. - Hi. - Isn't that Thelma? - Yes. - Has she come to visit you? - No, Thelma has moved back home. Well, that's good. It's OK. I've got it. I went to see Grandma at the nursing home. Is that what you're planning to do to me? Is it? Can you please let me go? Go to sleep. Trond? Trond? Trond! Trond? Where's Trond? What's going on? Thelma, don't leave. Thelma! Thelma! Thelma! Thelma... - Hi. - Hi. - You look like a real babe today. - Thank you. You too. My jacket suits you.
