Imagine an end to crime, an end to poverty. Imagine two million good jobs waiting to be filled. Sounds like a dream, doesn't it? Well, sometimes dreams come true. Delta City. For Our Children. This is Media Break. You give us three minutes and we'll give you the world. Good evening, I'm Casey Wong. Our top story tonight, Motor City goes Japanese as the Omni Consumer Products Corporation ended months of speculation today by announcing its takeover by the multinational Kanemitsu Corporation. Come on, honey. Hurry up with your calculus. It's almost time for bed. Mom, I'm watching Media Break. As the first private corporation... Come on, honey. ...to completely own and operate a major city. Company spokesmen expressed special interest in the delicate issues of urban resettlement and a crime wave in Detroit that many citizens are calling a war zone. But, as usual, OCP has an answer. Meet the Rehabs, urban rehabilitation officers. From the blazing fields of the Amazon War, comes state-of-the-art urban pacification. We're here to help the people, to augment the police force, and deal with the gang problem. What about reports you're actually rousting people from their homes to make way for construction of Delta City. Nikko, you heard your mom. Go on. Oh, man. What about the homeless? What a gyp. A lot of buildings have to come down before Delta can go up. So, I won't deny we're serving an eviction notice or two, but most of these people have already taken their urine tests and placement exams, they've got new jobs waiting for them, we're just helping them make the transition. That's all. We're cops, nothing more. Nothing more? Well, we're not robots, if that's what you mean. Hey, Dad? You're supposed to be asleep. Is it true what the TV said? That it's a war zone outside? Don't listen to what the TV says. This is your home. You hear me? And you're safe here. I'll buy that for a dollar. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! This neighborhood is the property of Omni Consumer Products. All residents are requested to vacate the area. For God's sake, help us! That's what we're here for, ma'am. Just get on the bus. Where are they taking us, Dad? What's happening? Don't believe 'em! They'll throw us in the streets to die like rats! Nazi sons of bitches! Shoot her if you have to, but get her out of here. Yes, sir. Let's go. Come on. I think it's going rather well, don't you, Seltz? Yes, sir. Come on! I said, move! Manhandle an old lady, would you? Shut up! Move it! Move it! Get up there! I said get up! What are you doing down there, you piece of slime? Didn't you hear me? I said get up, you drunken cow! Get back! The crane's gonna blow! Come on! Come on, move it! Move it! Listen to me, people! These buses are going nowhere! Stay here! Fight for your homes! There is no silver lining, only corporate scumbags, who wanna line their pockets! Stay here! Nikko! Nikko! Nikko! Mom! Mom! Dad! Nikko! No! Not my baby! Nikko! Nikko! Mom! Dad! Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom! Mom! Dad! Mom! You! Stay where you are! This neighborhood is the property of Omni Consumer Products. All residents are requested... ...here to assist you. Repeat. The rehabilitation officers are here to assist you. Personal possessions are limited to carry-on size. No furniture... Hush. It's okay. It's okay. You're with us now. Is he gone? Are we clear? Clear! Okay, let's do it! Okay, Moreno, cover your ears. Rock 'n' roll. All clear. Let's go. Whoa! Jesus! Ed 209! He wasn't in the recon photo! Freeze! You are trespassing on police property. Please surrender your weapons. What the hell? What is she... What is she crazy? You have 20 seconds to comply. Hey kid, come back here! You're gonna get us all killed! What the hell is she doing? You are in direct violation of Penal Code 114, Section 3. I am authorized to use physical force. You now have 10 seconds to comply. You won't believe this. He'll be loyal as a puppy. You have five seconds, four seconds, three seconds. You have one second to comply. I am now authorized to... Be loyal as a puppy. Will it work? Stole it off a dead cop. Holy shit! That's the police armory! Come on, come on. They must have deleted the access signature. Let's get out of here! No, they'll be a few more minutes. All we gotta do is figure out how to get that door open! Are you kiddin' me? Oh. Oh. - Yeah! - Wow! One-stop shopping. Let's go! Gotta get out of here! All right, all right, all right! What are you, pickin' out drapes? Come on! I'm comin'! Get that. Why? It looks expensive. Come on! Come on! Let's go! Drop your weapons! Now! Do it! Drop 'em! Freeze. You are trespassing on police property. Eat lead, suckers. Nikko, get in! Come on! Here comes Santa Claus Here comes Santa Claus Right down Santa Claus lane Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer What can I do for you, pal? Nobody move! Everything in the register! Now! Do it! Here comes Santa Claus Here comes Santa Claus Right down Santa Claus lane What's it like being a rocket scientist? All units, we have a confirmed B and E involving police property. Please respond. Repeat. All units, we have a confirmed... Hey, Donnelly, it's your turn. No way, man. No. We went last time. No, it's Lewis's turn. Okay, okay, okay! Lewis, you're up! Lewis, Lewis, Lewis. Lewis, Lewis, Lewis. Hey! Isn't anybody going to arrest me, or what? Hey, Lewis, where's your friend Murphy, anyway? He's not real big on donuts. "He's not big on donuts." I knew that. All units, repeat. That is a battered yellow van, no plates. Sig tracking shows southbound... Hey, that's a battered, yellow van. No shit, Sherlock. Hey, Moreno, company's comin'! Hold on. Here we go! Unit 477 in pursuit eastbound Esposito. Watch it, watch it, watch it. I'm watchin' it, I'm watchin' it. Jeez, ahhh! Hey, Moreno, they're still on our tail. Hey, don't sweat it. Here, watch this. Hold the champagne. You stopped in the middle of the damned street. What the hell is going on? That was my light! I had the light! You idiot! Is everybody okay? Okay? What are you, a comedian? I traded in a brand-new SUX for this Classic. Now, look at it. It's garbage. It's going to the junkyard. What the hell is this, fellas, huh? You give a broad a badge, and she gets delusions of gander, huh? It's grandeur, dumb shit. This new guy is making me nervous. I don't think this is exactly a guy, Moreno. You think it's him? Unit 477 to Dispatch. This is 477 to Dispatch. Come in, Dispatch. We could use some backup out here. Hello, Dispatch? Come in. This is 477, Dispatch. Lewis. Splatterpunks. Wait a second! Wait a second! What do you need the shotgun for? Ah, shit, we're all going to die! Sit tight, people. Backup's coming. Sit tight? Hey, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even be here, you dumb broad. I'll make you a deal, tough guy. You want to eat the tie, keep it up. Take it easy. My brother's a cop. 477 to Dispatch. We have a Code 3. We're low on ammo and need immediate backup. Right now. Sergeant Reed, I've got Murphy's cruiser on the grid, sir. He just turned around. He what? Murphy, this is Reed! I have three other vehicles en route to Lewis! Murphy, continue pursuit! That is a direct order! Do I make myself clear? Murphy, are you listening? Police officer. No loitering. You called for backup? Thanks for dropping by, Murphy. Are they gone? I'm still scanning three. Make that two. Clock it, Jack! Make us our own invention! Pop a tranq, hypo-head. Splatterville is ours. Shoot him in the mouth, splatter-brain! Cyborg eats bullets, Jack! Not tonight, he don't. Shoot him in the mouth! Do it! Do it! Shut up! Shut up! Do it! Do it! Shut up! Come on, shoot him in the mouth! - Do it! - Shut up! - Shut up! - Shoot him! Nice try, creeps. Give me it! You have the right to remain silent. Down there. Jesus, Murphy, are you okay? I'm fine, Ann. Thank you for asking. Come on, come on, get on. I want this area cleaned up. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go! Everything will be all right. I have to ask you to move with me. Come on! Get your damn hands off... Stupid kid. Hey, come here. Come on. Would you forget the stupid kid already! Come on, in here. Kanemitsu-san, please. Kanemitsu-san, I realize we've had certain setbacks, but you've got my word. We've done everything humanly possible to get Delta City back on schedule. Kanemitsu-san, please, that's not necessary. Gentlemen. You are now looking at a company in transition. Needless to say, this has resulted in the implementation of certain, uh, well... Oh, let's call them cutbacks. Ah, but who can put a price tag on a dream? Our esteemed former chairman had a dream. He called it Delta City. Knock it off, Johnson. The great city of Detroit represents an important precedent, gentlemen. There's only one small problem. It's turning into a war zone! Sir, it's just a small resistance group. And there's no reason to believe they pose a significant threat. Well, I'd consider a deficit of $350 million a significant threat, wouldn't you, Johnson? - Fleck! - Sir. You're in charge of Security Concepts. Where's that Robocop we spent so much money on? The police had a little problem with the unit, sir. I'm dealing with it personally. You do that. You get him to the Rehab team, and maybe we won't have to worry about a small resistance group. Get the hell out of here! All of you! Oh, you take your time. And for God's sakes, Fleck, try to get the police on our side. What if I don't want a robot on my team? You've got four days, McDaggett. If Cadillac Heights isn't cleared for demolition by Friday midnight, our loans will be called in. OCP will be ruined. We made a deal, didn't we, chum? Oh, by the way, if you're just now figuring out the line between big business and war is a little blurry, then you're further over the hill than they say you are. This is entrapment. My client was visiting close personal friends in that motel. Hey, buddy, your client's close personal friends were a non-union video crew and a German shepherd. That's prejudicial. Did the arresting officer ask to see their union cards? Yeah, yeah! Cecil, come get this crap. Will somebody please answer the damn phone? Metro West. No, ma'am, we're not on strike. You could've fooled me. I'll deal with them looters myself, get me a baseball bat with some nails in it. How're you feeling, Murphy? I've been better. Well, I'll be honest with you, it looks like you just made friends with a Mack truck. I don't have many friends. Captain gave me the same speech. Yeah, well, I heard it before. How many times does that make "before"? Dr. Lazarus? You want to tell me what happened. Well, Atlanta beat the Pistons last night. That's cute. I meant with, uh, glory boy. Oh, him. He got shot to hell and, uh, set on fire. You know what I'm talking about. He disobeyed a direct order. I want to know why. My real opinion? No, lie. Make up a story. Well, Mr. Fleck, offhand, I'd say the only reason he'd disobey an order is if he didn't agree with it. Excuse me? Well, he made a decision. His friend was in trouble and he made a judgment call. Cops do that, you know. It's in the manual. Human cops do that. What do you mean, his friend? This thing's a machine. Look, if OCP just wanted a robot, why the hell did they put Murphy in there in the first place? Murphy's dead, sweetheart. That's on record. Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy. What's left of his face, portions of the cerebrum, the cerebellum, it's human tissue that's still alive. How can you interface human components with a machine and then complain when the human part makes a decision? Okay. So, not only did we get Murphy's years of training and his law enforcement skills, we also inherited his... His memories, his feelings, his emotional baggage? Well, I'd call it his humanity, but I don't think you know that word. I see, well... Tell you what, Doctor, you talked me into it. His emotions, get rid of 'em. Find out where they're located and erase them. If that means wiping out his memory, that's too bad. Um, we could cut out the appropriate circuits by, uh, implanting a micro neuro-barrier. Do it. 'Cause I got news for you, babe, I don't give a shit how smart you are. OCP owns the cops. That means they own him. It means they own your cute little ass. Nobody owns me. Fine. We want him on the Rehab team. That means you make him predictable, or you look for a new job, sweet cheeks. I think I'm in love. What's going through your head, Murphy? That's his family. Do you want me to install that neuro-barrier, Doctor? No. I can do it. I think I'd like to be alone with him, if it's all right? Alex, I thought you'd never get home. Do not let the fact that these people are homeless sway you. They are terrorists, pure and simple. On the screens are suspected rebel locations. If any of these locations appear on your regular beat, check it out. Make sure you report any unusual findings... Hey, Lewis. Did you hear what they did to Murphy? ...and a brief description of the suspicious... Murphy. Hey, Lewis, you want your body armor? What? No. I'm off duty. What's up, anyway? Do you have family? Yeah. I have a brother in Pittsburgh. The one who doesn't call. You know that. Robo, are you okay? I'm fine. And call me Murphy. Murphy? Step out of the building. Stay right there. We're police officers. We don't want you. We have reason to believe there are squatters in that structure. Now, step away from the door. They're civilians inside. They're just trying to stay warm. Those people belong in the nearest rehabilitation center. Some of them are armed terrorists. Now step away from the door, or you'll be cited for obstructing justice. Look, I'm not going to ask politely next time. Now step away from the door. This is your final warning. You are making a mistake. Back off, or there will be trouble. Now you're talking, Murphy. We're not budging. If you want to get in there, you gonna have to shoot through us. I don't have a huge problem with that. Cease fire! Robocop. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come with us! Cover me. Let's go! Let's go! Some tough cop I am, huh, partner? Murphy. I'm scared. Don't be. It won't hurt long. Get them for me. Promise me. I promise. Murphy. Officer down. Just move it! Come on! Come on, people, we don't have much time. Nikko, let's go! Come on. Come with us. What, is she crazy? He's a cop! He's one of them. He's on our side now. She's right. Oh, you saw what he did. What are you gonna let some stupid kid make our decisions now? We're at war, Coontz. We could use his help. Are you kiddin' me? Look at him! He's totaled, man! People, come on! We don't have time for this shit! He's right. We should go. Five meter spread! Search the perimeter. Let's go! Move it! Over there! Damn. We're tracking him, sir. He's moving. That's impossible. The building's surrounded. He's gone underground. Find a manhole. We got a little held up. Rats? One or two. Go on through. Hey, are you okay? I'm fine. Hey! You guys! No, man! I told you it was a mistake to bring him. Bet he weighs a ton. This is Rebel 2 to Base Op. - Come in, Base Op. - Watch your step. All right. We've got wounded over here. Clear the way, people, come on. Get out of the way. Hold up your side. He don't look too good. Well, you wouldn't look so good either if you took a grenade in your chest. Tracking. - Beacon. - Tracking? Tracking beacon? What did I tell you? He's gonna lead them right to us. Oh, shut up, Coontz. Nikko, what's he talking about? Did he booby trap the 8th Street entrance? Maybe. Better get mobilized, folks. They got a little too close to home that time. It's not worth it, man. It is not worth this shit! You better take a real deep breath right now, Coontz. Because if you don't think it's worth it, then you're nothing but excess baggage. Do you hear me? You get it together, Coontz. Cadillac Heights may not be much, but it's our homes. It's all we got. Now if you don't think our homes is worth it, then you tell me what the hell is? This is Bertha to Base Op. We're comin' in. Set an extra place. We're bringing in a friend. Incoming caller. What do you want? Nice work, doll face. What're you talking about? You haven't heard? You might wanna turn on Media Break. TV on. Channel 378. Witness to the tragic shooting, was Rehab commander, Paul McDaggett. Well, uh, all I can say is, it's a terrible loss of a fine fine public servant. It's hard to believe she was gunned down by her own partner. An OCP spokesperson has confirmed that Robocop has joined the terrorist rebel forces. He is heavily armed and should be considered extremely dangerous. - On the... - TV off. Congratulations, sweet cheeks. Now listen up. I want your legendary ass and your corporate ID card in my office by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. And maybe you won't be brought up on charges. Meantime, you might want to decide who's side you're on. Sleep tight. Call complete. He what? He opened fire on the Rehabs. They're saying he's gone underground. Oh, there goes our P.R. budget. It's too big to put a lid on. Company line is he's gone renegade. How'd the CEO take it? How do you think the CEO took it? Between me and you, Johnson. I think the CEO is starting to lose it. I mean, take a look around, will you? It's the fall of Rome around here. It's Darwin time. You know what I'm saying? Survival of the least expendable. Remember the Old Man, Jeff. Everyone's expendable. It can't be that bad. Honey, can you hear me? Are you there? Every corporation goes through this sort of thing. Oh, my god. What happened? Oh, my god. What happened? Hey, Wilson, what's happening? Arnott just went out the window. That's the fourth one this month. Chicken shit! I'd eat a bullet myself. Less showy. I'll tell you, Johnson, the writing was on the wall the minute we hopped in the sack with that piece of shit Kanemitsu Corporation. As I was saying, Otomo-san, we have a warrant out for the arrest of Robocop. If we eliminate him, then we'll find that the squatters are more, well, let's say, easily persuaded. Fleck, a word with you, son. I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir. Is there anything Security Concepts can do? Security Concepts can kiss my freckled butt. You're fired. You heard me, Fleck! You're fired! Get out of here. Three days till disaster. What the hell will I tell my shareholders, Johnson? What about more Rehabs, sir? We could recruit them out of the existing police department. It will be cheaper than hiring mercenaries. And we could use the Metro West facilities as a staging area. Give them a nominal raise for an incentive. You're a good man, Johnson. I knew there was some reason I made you a vice president. Thank you, sir. I really... Yo, yo, heads up, heads up. Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late. Well? Can you fix him? This isn't a valve job on a Chevy. I never worked on a damn Robocop before. I can do the body work, but... Look, all we gotta do is hold onto the Heights for three more days. He can hold out till then, can't he? Bertha, are you listenin' to me? Huh? He is messed up. We don't have the equipment. Well, who the hell does? Lazarus. Find Doctor Lazarus. Hey! Who are you? I'm friends with Robocop. Oh. Well, he's not here. I'm sorry. You don't believe me. To tell you the truth, I don't know what to believe anymore. He... He had a message for you. He said to thank you for not taking his memories away. Well, well, well. Afraid you're a little late, pal. You must be one of Kanemitsu's boys. I'm impressed. Trouble is... Your boss. He kind of owns OCP. And OCP is kind of on our shit list with a bullet. Uh. So you wanna know where the rebels are? You can tell your bosses to kiss my ass. A vehicle is approaching. How're you doing, Murphy? I've been better. Give me a status scan. Organics intact. System's efficiency, 23%. It looks like a direct hit to the heart. I may have to recalibrate the pneumatic systems as well. Is he gonna die? Not if I can help it. Let's get everything hooked up to the generator. We've got work to do. Now, listen. I'm gonna unplug you for a little while, cowboy. Don't worry. Everything's going to be okay. Here you go. I got that heart you wanted. I said a Nissan. That's a Kanemitsu. Oh, Jesus! Jeez! Hey, Zack, we need that sealant pack. Zack! Marie! Marie, look! Oh, shit. Hey, bring that chest plate over here. Time for the chest plate. Huh? Hey! You wait, man. You are gonna be so cherry. Hey, Moreno, watch out for the, uh... What the hell are you doing, man? Well, I didn't know that thing was there. What are you trying to do? It's behind the... Don't yell at me. Well, don't do it. Murphy. It's you. Alex, I thought you'd never get home. Welcome home, Murphy. I couldn't sleep. How are you feeling? My efficiency rate is 93%. Anything above 90 is considered normal. Um, I heard Marie call you Murphy. Is that your real name? It was. Before... Before what? So, um... Now that you're better, will you stay? Will you help us? You know what Bertha says? She says if we hold back the Rehabs for just two more days, they won't be able to make us move. And they'll have to let my parents go. And we'll all be together like family again. Your parents? Murphy, you okay? Your parents, you miss them? Yeah. But you remember them. Because if you remember them, they're never really gone. Hey, Murphy, I'm glad your new heart works. I heard voices. She should be in bed. Could you leave her just a moment? Of course. Won't be the same, dear If you're not here with me Hey, you gotta pay for that. Hey! What are you, deaf? Son of a... That's not what we said we were going to do. That is, too, what we were gonna do. That's not what we said we were going to do. That's where the Heights is. Right there. Right there. Hey, Bertha, you told us to relocate the weapons, but where do you want this thing? Oh, my God. How did you get this? We stole it from the police depot. Why? You know this looks like the exhaust system from an F-27. No. It's the prototype for Robo's flight pack. The funding ran out before we got a chance to test it. How do you know so much about it? Oh, I designed it. Well, it looks like the odds on the home team just went up. Okay, now what I've done is programmed the command system to take its cues from your hard drive. I've also rigged it to work as an auxiliary power unit. So, if you ever have a power drain like you did yesterday, just interface with the flight pack and recharge whether you fly or not. And, Nikko, you see those resistors over there by the ratchet? Get them for me, will you? Get them for me, will you? Get them for me. Get them for me. Promise me. Get them for me. Promise me. What's goin' on? Excuse me. Hey, man, where you goin'? Unfinished business. It's okay. He'll be back. He needs us, too. Where's he going? To keep a promise. Sarge, you got a Robocop. You got an alien cop? Huh? You got ghost cop? Leon, I told you, I don't have time for this. You got a vampire cop? Murphy. Good evening, Sergeant Reed. Do you know there's a warrant out for your arrest? Yes. I was just checkin'. What can I do for you? Please direct me to the Rehab staging area. Oh, well, it's just down the hall. You can't miss it. Thank you. You may want to call the fire department. Quadrants fourth grade are clear. All central units are to remain on Class-4 alert until 2200 hours. - Hey, you got a light? - Sure, man. Allow me, scum. Look out! Ahhh! Oh, shit. Where's McDaggett? He's coming out tonight That does not look like a police station. You're damn right, I'm not at the police station. If my spy hadn't warned me, I'd be dead now. I thought your damn ninja was supposed to take care of Robocop for me. That's the deal. I clear the area, he keeps the robot off my back. You have the device I had sent you? It hasn't come to that yet, and it won't. Relax. It is difficult for me to continue our business relationship when I do not know your methods. You don't need to know my methods. I said I'll clear the area, and I'll clear it. Just get the robot cop off my back. I understand you're willing to pay good money to know where the rebel Base Op is. Yes, well, um... The money's good, if the tip's good. Yeah. Well, uh... The last tip saved your ass, didn't it? Hey, hey, hey, hey! What do we have here, huh? What's the matter? You don't like a man in uniform, huh? Look, my dad lost his job. I just need some money. That's all. Oh, we got lots of money, honey. Don't! No! She said, "no"! Huh? Maybe you have a hearing problem. Go home, young lady. You are in violation of curfew. Where's McDaggett? Room 212. Thank you. I hope you are insured. Elevator door sticks. Don't. I have a message from Officer Lewis. Stop! Drive! I said drive. Goddammit, drive! ...I want my time, my money. I told you once. And I'm not going to tell you again. You understand? I must commandeer your vehicle for police use. What is your problem, sucker? I mean, Officer. Cover me! Commander! Hey, what's the deal, Robo was shot? Where the hell is Robocop? We could drive around and listen for explosions. Hey, are you doing that? I got tired of splicing wires, so I put in a pulse tach decoder. A telemetric? - No. - Smart ass. I know you are, but what am I? Here, let me try it. Thanks for the heart attack, Coontz. Maybe I will go and send out a recon team. I got a better idea. Why don't we just all have a seat and relax? It'll all be over in a few minutes. You son of a bitch. Hey, watch the language. There's children present, remember? Drop it, Coontz. I'm not gonna ask twice. What did you mean about it all being over in a few minutes? Get the kids out of here! Now! - Where are we going? - Just follow me. Bertha! Oh! No. Go. Got to get her. Go. Come on, let's go. Come on! Now! Okay, come on. Come on! Get in! Come on! Come on. Keep going. Okay. Now go! Go on! No! It's happening again. Don't let them take you away. I said go! Get out of here! Where is he? Go to hell. Take her to headquarters. I promise my men won't leave a mark on you. Let's go. We got 'em all. Sir, what about our friend Coontz? Well, if we'd let him live, we'd have to have paid him. This building is now under OCP jurisdiction. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. So Murphy can be rough on properties. Good, well, every cent of it will be coming out of your salaries. Hey, you built him. Sergeant, we're taking Cadillac Heights. I'll need 50 of your men armed and in full-body armor in one hour. Mr. Johnson, you can tell the CEO the demolition crews will have total access at 0600 hours tomorrow morning. Hey, we don't do that kind of work. That was a direct order, Sergeant. Driving people out of their homes is no work for a cop! Now, Sergeant, 15 years on the force is quite an investment. Your job, your pension. Maybe instead of worrying about these squatter people, you might think about your own family. I am. I'm thinking I have to go home and face them. You can't do this! Look, you are employees of OCP. Now remember that! You're jeopardizing your retirement benefits. Stop that man. How would you and your friends like to make some money, chum? - It's... - Johnny... - Rehab! - Hooray. Johnny Rehab. Action figures, parts and accessories all sold separately. Three nuns and five clergy are dead today in what is believed to be the latest atrocity by the killer cyborg, Robocop. OCP officials claim the former police unit is responsible for a spree of terrorism in the Cadillac Heights section of old Detroit. I'm sorry. I can't even read this. Come on, this is bullshit. Are you buying this? I mean, are you kidding me, Robocop? Marie. You lousy sons of bitches! OCP bastards! Nobody is listening to you, sweetheart. This is Big Stick to all teams. You have a green. Arm up and proceed to strike zone. All teams, we have a green. All teams, we have a green. Hey, take it easy. Jimmy! Hey, wait up! Come on! Come on! So, what now? What now? Game's over, Moreno. Just shut up. What about Bertha's plan? Dammit, Bertha's dead! I'm sorry. I'm... There. Folks, in about 45 minutes, the Rehabs are coming to blow you out of your neighborhood. I want you to take your kids and anybody who shouldn't be fighting to the basement. The rest of you are hereby deputized by the Detroit Police Department. It's time to show how real cops kick ass. Detroit Police. Identify yourself. You are under arrest for assaulting an officer. And destruction of police property. Quiet! Quiet! Hold your fire until absolutely necessary! Commander, Detroit Police are out there, sir. They're fighting against us. So? We have a schedule to keep. We don't fire on police officers! You're out of line, McDaggett. I'm still in charge here. I'm pulling the plug! Sit down. What, you've gone war wacky? I said, sit down. Good idea. How are we getting out of here anyway? Nikko! How did you get... No, never mind. Did you see a transmission dish outside? Yeah, and I was just watching the Media Break guy pick his nose. Okay, do you have your computer with you? People of Detroit, this is an illegal broadcast. It may be cut off at any time, so listen to me. OCP is lying to you. They're destroying people's lives for big business. Those Rehabs you see on TV, they're mercenaries hired by OCP to throw people out of their homes and into the streets! You've got to believe me. I'm speaking for all the homeless and jobless citizens of this city and every city like it run by the heartless, capitalist scumbags who want you to think their way and do whatever will make them more money. See those commercials for Delta City where the future has a silver lining? Well, only silver is lining their pockets. OCP doesn't care about the people. OCP cares about rich people. Right now, as I speak, the people of Cadillac Heights are being forced out of their very own neighborhood. Your neighborhood's next unless you fight back now! Time is running out. OCP is the enemy... I repeat, time is running out. OCP is the enemy. Help us. Innocent people are dying. Need more ammo. Ammo! Ammo! Zack's hit! They're winning, aren't they, Sergeant? What in the name of... Yes! Sir? Splatter that, you sons of bitches. All right, Mr. Robocop, come and get me. Get away from the door! Think it over! Oh, my God, Johnson. Our stock has dropped to nothing. We're ruined. How may I help you, Officer? By resisting arrest. Don't count on it, chum. Anyway, what's the charge? The murder of Ann Lewis. Dead or alive, you're coming with me. McDaggett, you can have OCP. It's all yours. Sayonara. Where are you going? You're gonna miss all the fun! No flashy bravery, tin man, or the two cuties say "bye-bye". What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop them! Stop them! Stupid fools! Don't you know what you've done to us? Those androids are programmed with a thermal fail-safe device. They're made to self-destruct. In 15 seconds, everything within 20 yards of where we're standing will be atomized. We're dead, you stupid slag! Don't count on it, chum. Hang on. Come on. Let me give you a hand. Kanemitsu-san, I... I realize that it looks bad, but maybe our plans were over ambitious. Let's start a sukoshi bit smaller. Let's gentrify this neighborhood, build strip malls, fast food chains, lots of popular entertainment. What do you think? What did he say? He said you're fired. Well, I got to hand it to you. What do they call you? Murphy, is it? My friends call me Murphy. You call me Robocop.
