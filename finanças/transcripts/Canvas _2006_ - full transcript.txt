Ahoy, matey! What do we call this? The tiller. And what does the tiller do? It steers the boat. Excellent. Now, hold on to it tight, all right. I want you to steer it. Do you see the arrow up there? I want you steer it into the wind Where the arrow is pointing, Because I won't be able to pull up the sails. All right, I want you to take the tiller And hold on to it tight. All right, now, listen.
