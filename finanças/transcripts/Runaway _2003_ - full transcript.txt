I had a cumbersome past. To put it aside and think of the future, I had to use 5 large wooden boxes. In a meticulous job, I filed 96 kilos of court documents, thousands of letters, telegrams, hundreds of newspaper articles. Now the 5 crates are in the cellar, they keep the documentation of my last 18 years of life. Almost half of my existence. THE FUGITIVE Is it possible that you don't want to see that things are changing? What is changing? It's you who don't want to change. - Capitalism is not what you think. - No! - Yes, it is. - No, it's not true. Stop it. The same story every day. Yes, because you are young, you are just young. - You're wrong dad... - This is how it is. We do politics. Massimo, first finish the high school, and then we'll talk about it. - Bye. - I'm going to the office, - Your father loves you. - I know mum, but that sucks. - Will you come back for dinner? - No, I'll eat with Alessandra. What a pity. I wanted to make green pasta. Bring Alessandra! - And buy the bread. - All right. See you later. Excuse me. You have two options: go home and do nothing or go to the carabinieri as a witness. Lawyer, Massimo is an active militant. and these days, you know better than me that... You always want to politicize everything. Let's be serious, please. Our country is based on judgement, not on prejudice. And the carabinieri don't mind it when there is a murder involved. So? What do you want to do? Lawyer Vignoni, testimonies should not be made in the presence of the defender. Zorzi, please. - Can you wait for me outside? - Sure. So, why didn't you come to us immediately? I ran away. I was afraid. When you're all together, you're like lions. There was a gentleman with a dog, we clashed, he saw me. Look for it! I don't know anything else! - What was the dog like? - I don't remember, it was a dog... Speak Carlotto, speak. - It was a small dog, I don't remember. - Yes, but how small? I don't know! I don't know! - Come on Carlo, tell us! - Speak, Carlo. Come on, Carlotto, talk! We are here until tomorrow morning, we have no commitments. - Let's start again, what's your name? - Massimo Carlotto. - Do you do drugs? - No, I don't do drugs. Ok, Carlo, you do politics, don't you? Yes! I came here just to testify. - What should we do? - Let's start again! - Sorry, what do you want? - The truth Carlotto, only the truth! I have already told you the truth! I have nothing to do with this. Boy, you don't understand that you are in a bad position. Let's start again! What's your name? How old are you? Do you do drugs? You make politics? Are you a terrorist? And continuing terrorism struggle. You are red like the blood of that poor girl! Massimo! Massimo! I don't understand, how is it possible? The accusation is serious. I know. They are convinced he's the culprit. But they have nothing in their hands. He was at the scene of the crime and he had bloodstains on the clothes. The real problem is they don't want to investigate in other directions. Than Massimo continues to talk about the man with the dog... - Let's hire a private investigator. - We are not in America. There is the preliminary investigation which prevents the defense from acting, and thinking that for them your child is the culprit... I don't know. Empty your pockets. Your watch. Bend over. I told you to bend over. Sit down, Carlotto. Mr. Judge, you finally understood. I've been in isolation for 37 days, and I hadn't done anything! - Yes, take a seat. - Yes. Chancellor, write. February 27, 1976... Where are you going, Carlotto? I'm going home. Peluso! Let go of me! I had nothing to do with it! I had nothing to do with it, lawyer! Lawyer, help me! Help me, lawyer, I didn't do a damn thing! They continue to keep him in isolation, with no proofs. They want to construct the case on the contradictions of his testimony. They hope he'll confess. - Are you sure he's innocent? - This has nothing to do with it! They arrested him before they investigated. This country is changing. What's happening? Should we be scared of the law? - Do you know that a witness... - I know the law, - But I think that... - He's a scapegoat, Carla. - I've got a nasty feeling. - About what? Young, ingenuous, scared and a political activist. He was at the crime scene and we're in Padua. Maybe they want to frame him, to shield someone else. PRISON REGISTER ONE YEAR LATER The Court orders a new report and another inquiry. How did it go? - Well? How did it go? - It's all got to be done again. He'd bet that they'd send you down. Two cartons of Marlboro. - Who with? - With the Calabrians in 114. The new report's favourable, but the situation hasn't changed. The Court will decide. It's cold here. The cell's worse. - There's another problem. - What? - They're transferring you to Cuneo. - Cuneo? It's a high-security prison! I'm okay, mum. Don't worry. But get me out of here. TWO YEARS LATER Adjourned for the president's illness. TWO YEARS, FOUR MONTHS LATER To be released from prison on the grounds of insufficient proof. Mum, I'm home! I'm home. Hello, dad. Come in. Hello. Yes, I know, we've only won the first battle. Tomorrow I'll present an appeal against the sentence. But the Public Procurator will present his case too. As you know, in Italy there are three grades of judgement. We'll face the Court of Appeal, then the Supreme Court. - Excuse me! - My God! Unfortunately, we must confirm that the body found in the car is that of President Aldo Moro. THREE YEARS LATER Condemned to 18 years imprisonment. The Supreme Court will choose between two sentences. I hope they will listen to their consciences. Let's hope so, even if... it seems like they want to make an example of him. If I was him, I'd be worried. I think it's perfect for us! Look at the terrace! We'll be fine here. We'll furnish it bit by bit. There we can put on a couch with red cushions and... - Don't you like it? - Yes, it's nice. I like it. What's wrong? Nothing. - What if they condemn me? - Don't even joke about it! It'll all blow ever and everything will be fine. We'll live together in this little house. SIX YEARS LATER They've confirmed the 18-year prison sentence. Get away, Massimo! Don't let them get you! Are you aware that the crime scene wasn't safeguarded? Journalists went in before the forensic! Important evidence was erased forever! New reports! Is that what they call an inquiry? The first Court ordered new reports because they were contradictory. The new reports were favourable, but the Court of Appeal ignored them. The judgement cancelled out all the inquiry's mistakes. - Sir, wait! - Report these things! Don't just print what suits you. PARIS - LYON GAR Our only hope is for the case to be reviewed. The Court ignored too many elements. It'll be another legal battle. It'll last for years. We'll request that the reports be conserved, or they'll go into the incinerator. The procedures are over for them. Where did he go, Alessandra? Where's Massimo? You know that. - You've got to tell us. - You know, don't you? No, I... - You know, yes or no? - No, I don't know. I'm going to wash my hands. Excuse me. - Well? - In Paris. Massimo's escaped to Paris. But he doesn't even speak French! - Thanks, goodbye. - Goodbye - Good morning. May I help you? - Bread. - Sorry? - Bread. A baguette! Here. 2 francs 90. - How much? - 2 francs and 90 cents. Come on, give it to me. Look: 2 francs and 90 cents. Thanks, goodbye. Good morning, Marie. I understand what do the other comrades say? I can't wait any longer! I'm still using my passport, I change hotels every three days! They'll get me sooner or later! I don't want... I don't want to go back to jail. Do something, find someone to help me! Sir, a beer please. For me too, please. Italian? Italy's nice! - You speak Italian? - A little. - You're a student? - Yes. Tourist? Yes, tourist. Excuse me, I'm waiting for someone. Are you Massimo? There's a person waiting for you. So, you're Massimo. At last! - Yes, I'm Massimo Carlotto. - The surname's not necessary. - I'm Lolo. Hi. - Nice to meet you. I was wrongly accused, you know. We've all got problems here, it doesn't matter what. We've got to help each other. - Where are you from? - Chile. How are you? In the shit. How's your French? - So-so... - Better study. How old are you? Twenty-five. So, the rules are few, but essential. Someone's looking for you. First rule: don't let them find you. You need a safe house. Don't attract attention, but keep your eyes and ears about you. You've got to become master of the situation. Study everything that surrounds your house. It's the only place you'll be safe. It'll be your refuge, your lair. You've always got to have an escape route, and it's got to be quick. Help me! They've taken my son! No, stay away from Italians. They're closely watched. They're all accused of terrorism. They're monitored by the French and Italian police. This is an open prison. We're the new generation of fugitives, but they've got a lot of experience. Being on the run is just a state of mind. What do you mean? First, you've got to believe you can go unnoticed. Few people can know who you are. I can get you false papers, but you'd better get used to changing your appearance often. Change your name... Bernard. Hello? Who's speaking? Hold the line, please. It's for you, dear. - Who is it? Vicky? - Bernard. Hello? Bernard who? You've got the wrong number. I said only call me if you're in trouble. It's not a game. You'll never do it, Bernard. It's not impossible, just different. You've got to try harder. Your life's changed, now you've got to change too. Hurt yourself any way you want, but don't give up. What kind of life's that? Time's our enemy, but you needn't fear it. We've got nothing to lose. Beautiful, isn't it? - So, you're Chilean! - Yes. - This filling was done in Chile? - Yes, of course. How long have you been in France? About three years. - Visit any other countries first? - No. Why are you asking questions instead of treating me? Because you're not Chilean. Your National Health card is false. We know all your tricks. Excuse me, but how dare you? I come here for treatment and you say I'm not from Chile! It's crazy. The filling was done in Europe. Are you Spanish? - No. - Italian? No, how can I tell you? I'm from Chile! Don't play with me. So, tell me the Chilean word for tartar. You'll think it strange, but I can't remember. You'll think it strange, but I'm calling the police. Don't, doctor. Please. You're right. I'm not Chilean, I'm Italian. But I'm not an immigrant. I'm risking 15 years in jail. I was wrongly imprisoned for 3. They accused me of a crime I didn't commit. If you call the police, you'll send an innocent man to jail. Believe me. Believe me this time. Sit down. Which tooth hurts? Thanks. - Excuse me, doctor? - Now what? Would you tell me something? Would any dentist have realised? No, but I worked in Chile for a couple of years. - Thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye and good luck. - Piedra. - What? Piedra. The Chilean word for tartar. You never know. France Soir, please. Thanks. Hello, Corriere Della Sera and France Soir. - Thank you. - Corriere Della Sera. And France Soir. Thank you. Sir! Good morning, sir! - Your papers, please. - Sorry, I don't speak French. - Passport, identification. - I don't understand, sorry. Italian? - Thierry! - You're lucky, sir. - I missed you so much. - Me too. You're smoking too much. No, I'll give up soon. Everyone sends their regards. I've brought about 20 letters. Thanks. How's it going? What a question! I'm worried. - So come and live here. - I wish! You're the one that's got to come home. Know what the perfect crime is? It's when the innocent pay instead of the guilty. It's nice here. I rented the whole beach just for us! Ale, I'm Massimo Carlotto! I'm Massimo Carlotto! I'm Massimo Carlotto! Massimo Carlotto! - I'm Bolivian. - Juan Manuel is Bolivian too. No, he's from Honduras. Excuse me, and welcome. Thank you. Paloma's nice. Carlos told me about Paloma and Juan Manuel. What kind of a damn place where you born in? - Didn't he tell you his story? - No. Carlos is a teacher. He was at school when they raped and killed his wife and daughter. He was in prison for three years. Prison's different in Salvador! We're all here because we've lost something. You mustn't feel lonely. They told me you're in bad shape. There's something that's not going like it should. Should I worry? No. Let's have a drink. You brought grappa! Want some? Cheers! Lock up, Josè. I'm going. If you want, I'll take you. France is the best place for fishing. - Thanks. - Goodnight. Alessandra and my parents arrive the day after tomorrow. Good. They do a lot for me. I don't want them to see me as Bernard or Josè. You're right. We'll find a house where you can be together for a few days. You'll be Massimo and they'll think everything's okay. Don't worry, I'll cover you at work. SEVEN YEARS LATER - Mario? - He's asleep. - Lucky him. How is he? - Fine. National news. The parliamentary debate continues over the enforcement of the new Penal Code. Come on, Bruno. - No cinema, right? - I'm exhausted tonight! - I promise we'll go tomorrow. - Yes! Honey, why do you always buy these horrible ties? - What do I care about ties? - You're starting to lose your hair! What are you on about? Honey, If I can put up with these ties, I'll still love you when you're bald! Bruno! You worked for the defence, remember the hair under the victim's nails? Yes, but it wasn't analysed. It wasn't the accused's. Otherwise they'd have used it against him. I was present when a sample of Carlotto's hair was taken. Why didn't we use it? In those days we could only do the trichological test. Today we can test the DNA and be certain of whose it is. How would a police doctor interpret this kind of evidence today? The first things to be checked are the victim's nails. If the hair belonged to Carlotto, the prosecution would have used it against him. - What are you getting at? - It's the killer's hair. Hope you've got a reason for being here. I'm going home, Lolo! There was a hair under the victim's nails. The DNA test will exonerate me. Lolo, I'm going home! I'll turn myself in. My lawyer's asking for my case to be reviewed. I'm happy for you, Massimo. A hair will save my life! Will you come to see me? Why did you come here? We said we'd meet at the border. I shouldn't be here or even know where to find you. - But I wanted to tell you myself. - What? No DNA test. - What? - The hair's disappeared, Massimo. - Disappeared from where? - The Forensic Medicine Institute. - How's it possible? - I don't know. It was under lock and key with other evidence. They can't find it. I'm screwed! Screwed! No, the review of your case isn't compromised. - I'm screwed! - We've got other elements! The hair was indisputable proof! - We'd have nailed the killer. - Massimo, listen, we still can. Bullshit, lawyer! Lawyer, they took it from under your nose! Who the hell are they? Find out. Do something, lawyer! I've been overworking for years, I'm the laughing stock of the courts! And you tell me they took it from under my nose! It vanished, what have I got to do with it? Cut it out! Cut it out! Yes lawyer, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm screwed! I'm screwed! I want to go home. Carloto sentenced to eighteen years Illustrious president, judges of the Court, Destiny and God's will have given me the task of defending this young man. He's only guilty of having faith... In the law! I'll never forget January 20th '76. The young man told me he had witnessed a murder. He heard a woman screaming in a small villa. He found the door open and went in. I shouldn't have to defend him from a monstrous, unjust accusation. Gentlemen of the Court... What the hell am I going to do? In the last few years I've only cared about you. But what life have we got? We always meet in different houses, we make love, we swear eternal love, but what chance have we got for the future? Can't you see we're both serving the same sentence? There must have been a terrorist attack today. Calm down. - Where are you from? - Italy. - Ale, calm down. - What the hell are you saying? They're stopping all the cars! Ale, calm down! What the hell! This city's a mess! - We can't work in peace! - Who are you? You should collaborate! All right, you may go. Thank you. Italians, police, what a shitty life! Who was he, a saint? We made it, honey. Let's go home. Yes. And next time? What'll happen the next time? Alessandra, where are you going? Get out of my life, please. - Ale... - Please! Darling... Please. You've got a swollen liver and high blood pressure. You fainted because of stress, but you could die! I'll prescribe blood pressure pills, anxiety pills and anti-depressants. I can't do anything else. And chemo? Let's just keep it under control for now. - You eat, drink and smoke too much. - What do you want? Leave me alone. Massimo, you've got to take care of yourself. You've got to take more care of your health. I'm sorry. Mum, sorry. It's just stress. I'm fine. I'm sorry. Hello, Lolo. - You want to go just like that? - Yes. Why? - The hair vanished. I'm sunk. - What did you expect? That they'd let you discover the real culprit? It's not just that. If the police catch me, you all risk expulsion. I'll go to jail, but you'll pay a higher price. That's for us to decide! No. The further we go, the higher the risk. I just want to gain some time. I miss my mother. I miss my father. Alessandra, Padua... But you know what I miss most? How I miss most of all? Me, at age 18, with dreams and hopes. Everything's gone for good. I don't want another life. I want the one I had before. I'm playing a role I didn't want in a story that's not mine. It's time to leave Paris and it's illusions. I just wanted a fair trial, but it wasn't to be. I'm tired of hiding. And you're all too important to me. - You're my friends. - So stay here, with your friends. I can't. Don't you see? To turn things around, I've got to get as far away as possible. I'm choosing freedom. My rebellion against injustice. Thank you! The Esmeralda sails from the port of Toulon. It's an old tramp they use to transport phosphates. When you arrive, look for Thomas. He's Guatemalan, but he knows Mexico City well. I taped you some Chilean songs. Now you'll be forced to remember me. Swear you'll come straight back if you're in trouble. - Everything'll be fine. - Swear. I Swear. Now go, I'm tired of saying goodbye to friends. - You already learned the local ways! - Hi, Tomas. I enrolled at the university, just like you told me to. I met a professor who studied in Italy. He's a good person. What's his name? Xavier Casalas. I know him. I don't like him. I do. Thank you. - Massimo! - Happy birthday, Xavier. Welcome. This is my brother-in-law. - Massimo. Nice to meet you. - Luis Gimenez. It's a pleasure. Excuse me. - Nice party, isn't it? - Yes. Nice party. I know you've got a little problem. A problem with your papers... Don't worry! You can trust these people. I heard from mutual friends. I can help you. I'm a lawyer and I deal with immigration. My case is a bit complicated. Complicated cases are my specialty. Here in Mexico, the only thing that counts is knowing the right person. And having a bit of money. - Can we talk? - Not here. We're enjoying ourselves. But listen... Come to my office next week. - Have fun. - Thank you. Hello, judge. How are you? Fine. Yes, they're fine. Thank you. He'll be twelve next month. And we're getting old. Listen Ugo, I'm calling to ask a favour. I've never asked you before, despite our friendship. You're an experienced judge, I need your advice. Yes, it's about Carlotto. I need your help. Please read the trial records. Ugo, what do you mean, "Forget it"? - Hi, Kioko. - Hi, Massimo. How are you? - Fine and you? - Fine, thanks. - Have fun at the party? - Yes, a lot. Your husband wasn't enjoying himself. He was always by himself. He's older and he's got a stressful job. I'm young, I like having fun. - Good... - Well. - See you. - See you. Bye. Bye. Bye. - I was there. - Sorry? I was there. June 17th, 1970. Aztec Stadium. Italy vs. Germany. An unforgettable match! Yes, a great game. - The match of the century! - There's no doubt. Gigi Riva! - Do you smoke? - Yes, thanks. - Havana? - Thank you. So, you want to obtain Mexican citizenship quickly and without too much red tape. - Or am I mistaken? - No, you're not. I like Mexico very much. Even if... Let's say that I can't go through official channels. I'm the right person. I've studied your case and I've reached this conclusion: the best way to help you stay in this country is to provide you with a Mexican identity. If you have the money to cover the expenses, of course. And my fee too. How much? Bearing in mind that Xavier introduced us and that we have mutual friends, it'll be 2,000 dollars in advance. And another 2,000 on delivery of the documents. Cash, obviously. Good, Massimo. Tomorrow I'll start work on your case. Fine. I'll wait to hear from you, lawyer. - I'm leaving. Goodbye and thanks. - Don't even think of it. - I'll give you a lift in my car. - No, don't trouble yourself. - I live in another part of the city. - I insist. It's the least I can do. I've beaten them, Tomas. They wanted to put me in jail but I'm freer than ever! I don't exist anymore. With these papers I can do anything, even go back to Europe if I don't like Mexico. Europe? Wake up, Max. You've not got the documents yet. And then they'll only help you stay here. - Hidden amongst 20 million people. - You're wrong, friend. No one can doubt what's written on the passport. Yes, until they check your fingerprints. I could even go back to Italy and investigate the crime. Are you stupid? Why not? I don't exist anymore. You're mad. This city's infected you. I've never been more lucid. Finally I can see a future ahead. A future for me. What do you want? Let me go. What's your name, you bastard? Massimo Carlotto. Your full name, you son of a bitch! I told you, Massimo Carlotto. Carlotto is your father's name, or your mother's? - My father's. - What's your mother's? - Villani. - Well, son of a bitch, your full name is Massimo Carlotto Villani! So, what's your name? Again. Your name? Whatever you want. My name's whatever you want. I don't know. He's trying to be smart. He needs a special dose. No, no, no... - Is he alive? - We don't know. You're being deported. You're an undesirable in Mexico. We'll take you first home, and then to the airport. You can go where you want. But don't come back here, or next time we'll put you in prison. And there... - Can I go where I want? - It's none of our business. Let's go, kid. Luis Gimenez was in the police force before becoming a lawyer. Didn't you know? His brother-in-law Xavier knew that. Of course he knew, you bastard! MILAN 1985 Go through, thank you. Passport, please. I'm Massimo Carlotto, I've come to give myself up. There's no arrest warrant here. Nor here. What'll we do? Nothing. There's no warrant. Are you sure you're wanted? What should I do? Go? Le Monde will publish the request for the review of the case. - The first signature is Jorge Amado. - Will it do any good? Yes, but it'll take a lot of work. We'll need a dossier and support committees. Massimo's Italian friends must have more faith in the strength of public opinion. Incredible! No one looked for him. No one! The arrest warrant was in a drawer. They had trouble finding it. Thank you. Carlotto, mail! LAWYER GIMENEZ MURDERED IN CITY CENTRE PADUA 1988 - Hello, Massimo. How's it going? - Any new developments? I asked the magistrate to suspend your sentence because of your illness. It's worth a try. The medical report states you can't stay in jail. They'll never agree. Every day they publish articles on your case. We're not alone. You've got support groups in Paris, London, Padua, Milan, Rome and Cagliari! Have faith. We're not alone in asking for justice. You're back! I'm dropping the case. Enough. Yes, you're right. You gave him ten years of your life. They screwed him. He'll serve the sentence instead of someone else. You're just his lawyer. The law runs its course. And then, Bruno, you can turn a blind eye for once, it won't be the end of the world. I'm pleased. At last our life will change. Carlotto's a client like all the others. Good! - Are you making fun of me? - No. No, no. - Shouldn't I drop it? - Never, Bruno. Never. - It wouldn't be you. - You know I can't do it. I can't. But if I don't help him, who will? They framed him, it's not right. - His parents do what they can... - This is lawyer Vignoni I know! Want to marry me? No. Beniamino. What is it? I feel sick. Guards! Guards! Here's the report, Massimo's critical. It's as if he's got 2 ounces of butter to every litre of blood! His metabolism's changed. He's sick! He could die in prison, for Christ's sake! The lawyer called. The magistrate suspended the sentence for a year. If the defendant had presented the request for a review after the new law came into force, today he would be fully acquitted. This Court, doubting which law to apply, refers the records to the Constitution Court Mr President! The Court shouldn't have ignored temporary provisions of the law! Carlotto should have been fully acquitted! Ridiculous! Another trial because the judges don't know the new laws? A doubt that could be cleared up with a simple fax! - We'll go back the Criminal Court. - Of course! And what'll I do if they get it wrong again? Go back to jail like a good little boy? I'm not going back to jail. The groups cannot legitimise the umpteenth injustice in this case by supporting Massimo at the new trial. It would be a strategic error. Massimo must not attend the trial We must awaken public opinion to the reasons for this choice. But we'll deprive Massimo of the possibility to defend himself! The trial would continue with lawyers appointed by the Court! Massimo must be there to defend himself! As the law implies. And we'll be there with him! Bullshit! It's time to put our cards on the table! Let's try to win, at least once. In the name of the Italian, the Court rejects the request for a review and confirms the sentence issued on December 19th 1979 You should be ashamed! Judges! You call this justice? Sentence me too! Where are you going? Sentence me too! Come quickly, they're taking him away! Let's go. - No, it's illegal! - Out of the way, please. - We've got a warrant. - You can't do this! Lawyer, out of the way, please I got orders. No. - Let's go. - It's illegal! The warrant wasn't issued by the competent court. Wait, let me call the Public Procurator! - Let's go! - No, it's illegal. Let him go! Lawyer, if you don't calm down, we'll arrest you too! Please, stop it. Let's go. Do something. Not only was he denied acquittal as provided by the constitution, but he was arrested too. The arrest warrant issued by the Venice Public Procurator is illegal, because the decision lies with the presiding magistrate. We've requested a new hearing to ascertain whether his health can withstand incarceration. Our experts believe Carlotto's life is in danger. The Public Procurator has shouldered a serious responsibility. Hello, Beniamino. - I hoped not to see you again. - They've really screwed me! Want to go to isolation? Leave him, he's just a poor bastard. Yes? - They're here. - Show them in. This way. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. The tribunal called me. The judge has suspended the sentence for a year. It's good news! We'll take advantage of this year of freedom. There's the Supreme Court hearing, but let's not kid ourselves. At the 11th trial, the judges won't give the records to another Court. We'll take a different route so he won't go back to jail. - Like what? I don't understand. - Excuse me... Do you mean a presidential pardon? Bromazepam. Clortalidone, Phenobarbital. 100 milligram Paracetamol. Irreversible liver damage. Strong stuff! I'm all set with the pills. If I get really bad, swear you'll help me pass on. Are you stupid? I won't go back to jail. Let's do something. Let's find out who played this little joke on you. Then I'll handle things. No, Beniamino. I already told you. All right. What should I do? Come to the hospital and shoot you? No, I've thought of everything. You'll put two acid tabs under my tongue. I'm not into acid. That's druggy stuff. What about if I put a plastic bag on your head? You'll go straight back to jail! The acid is perfect. I read about it in a forensic medicine book. They'll think it's a heart attack. I'll go for the acid then. Thanks. Where can you eat well in Padua? Dressed like that? The Supreme Court confirms the sentence of the Venice Criminal Court. Here are the representatives of the Italian support groups. They want to discuss the official pardon with you. Massimo doesn't want to ask for it and he's right. According to the law, other parties can ask for it. In this case, you could sign the petition. Massimo has been through hell instead of someone else. We don't think that's right. It's like giving in to injustice. We know it's a very tough decision for you. But Massimo's life is at stake. Listen to them. From his story, it's clear we're all at risk. Who'll safeguard us? Only we can, by raising our voices. We've got to join forces! Let's break the silence and unite our voices! Those who can speak out must do it publicly. It's only 48 days till the pardon. Write letters to the papers. Let's do something. Let's do anything. Massimo is a special person. He doesn't cry, complain or shout. See how many people there are? - I didn't expect this. - You were wrong. - There's more than you think. - It won't do any good. But thanks, anyway. ...Like this, Massimo will be safeguarded by us. Even if he's pardoned, the State will still think him guilty. This is what makes us angry! Massimo Carloto got 17 years of rights in arrears. Let's at least try to give him back his life. Thanks. Thanks. I've not got much to say. I've got no hope left. The legal battle's been lost. Closed forever. I thank you with all my heart for what you've done and what you will do for me. Thanks to all of you. Unfortunately I've got nothing else to say. It's for you! - Hello? - Hello? Vicky... Lolo's dead. He'll be cremated and we'll scatter the ashes in a square in Santiago. That's what he wanted. I love you, Vicky. I love you. Bye. I'm pleased you came. I don't want you to go back to prison. It's my last vacation, Maria. I'll spend a few days in Padua with my parents and then... Aren't they lovely? Would you do it again? Would you testify again? Yes. I spoke to Vignoni. The Venice Public Procurator is against allowing the pardon. - I expected that. - We didn't. Let's not be discouraged. The minister and the President of the Republic know the law. - Maybe it'll take some time. - No. Time's run out. - I'm not going back to prison. - What do you mean? APRIL 7TH, 1993 AFTER 17 YEARS, 2 MONTHS AND 18 DAYS This Antonella and Maria's answering service. Please leave a message. It's Vignoni, the lawyer. This is a message for Massimo Carlotto. It's me, lawyer. Hello. It went well, Massimo! The President of the Republic has pardoned you! The pardon, Massimo! The pardon, Massimo! It's over! It's all over! - I'll call you back, thanks. - Yes, goodbye, Massimo. Maybe I should give up smoking.
