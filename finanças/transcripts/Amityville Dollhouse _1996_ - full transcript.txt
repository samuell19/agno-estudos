I thought this day would never come. Here we go, one, two, three, whoa, yeah. Well, what do you think Todd? - It's all right, I guess. - It took me 10 months to build this thing. All I get is it's all right? - Okay, it's great. - Dad, I think this house is amazing. - Yeah, honey, and we're gonna be real happy here. Give me a hug, mm, yeah. Come on, find some of your stuff there, okay. - If the moving trucks ever get here. Can you believe it? We're finally here. - Mom, are you sure it's up to code? - Hey, Jim, it's by the book. - What about earthquake-proofing, Mr. Martin? Honey, you can call him Bill. - I made sure that your bedroom has the best view of the backyard. Want me to show you? - Not in a million years, Bill. Jimmy! Oh, just give him a chance. He'll warm up. - Yeah, well a million years is a long time, honey. - Yeah, but we're worth the wait. Mm. - Oh, yeah. So? - Mm. - Huh, nice, huh? Here, let me show you something. What do you think, huh? - Uh, it's a little overwhelming, B. - Oh, come on, this baby's a classic, huh? User-friendly. Let me show you. Oh. Uh-huh. - Oh, I thank you. - Hey. - For all of this. Mm. - Ah, movers. - We're home. - Mm, yeah. Let's go. ♪ Gotta go home ♪ Gotta go home Whoa, nice room, man. I assume you're going for the total geek effect. - What do you want Todd? - Got one of your boxes by mistake. Now tell me this, man. How can a kid who likes to play with rats be afraid of spiders? - First of all, Max is a mouse. And if you must know, I have arachnophobia. - Oh. - Would you please leave. - Man, you are one uptight little dude. Subspecies. Uh, damn! - Nice going, Dad. Years of experience. - Claire wants you to stop messing with the lights. Okay. Guess I can give it a rest. You okay, huh? - Yeah. - What's the problem? - It's nothing. - You okay? - Yeah, it's nothing. It's Mom. She was supposed to call me, but she managed to forget again. - Nah, she didn't forget. No, it's just the difference between times in New York and here, that's, no, it's just hard to-- - Ah, to what, pick up a phone? - Hmm. - You should give it up. Truth is, she's ashamed of me. She can't stand being around and you know it. - Okay, you're right. Your mother has trouble with you, but it's her problem, Todd. It's not yours, all right, come on. - It still hurts, you know? Like Dad, you know, I miss it just being you and me. This whole new family thing sucks. - I'm just asking to give Claire and Jimmy a chance, Todd. That's all. - Oh, here we go. - Todd, this family's important to me. - Yeah, you've only told me that about a thousand times. - That's because you're the oldest. So I'm counting on your help, Todd. - Well, Claire's all right. - Oh, good. - But Jimmy, man. That kid is such a wimp. I used to eat kids like that for breakfast. - Yeah, and because you're such a pro at getting into trouble, I thought you'd be able to teach Jimmy how to stay out of it. - That's not gonna be too hard. Once a geek, always a geek. - Okay, Mr. Wise Guy. I'm taking that as a promise that you're gonna at least try. - All right. - Okay. Come here, I wanna show you something. - Where are we going? - You'll see. Come here, go long. - Oh, this thing looks nice. I thought you were gonna ditch this old thing. - Yeah, yeah, I was, but I don't know, there's something about it I like. Should we open it up? Dying to see what's inside. You know, you don't get out enough Dad. - Todd? Freedom. Hey, Mr. Martin. Your new house is amazing. - Thanks, thanks, Dana. - Look, Dad, um, you know, this is a real cool shed, but I haven't seen Dana in about a week and she got her license and-- - Yeah, okay, okay, okay, all right, all right. - All right. - But just remember what we talked about, all right? No more trouble. - I swear. I want you home at 11. - No problem. You're gonna burn. - Hmm. Huh. What the hell is this? Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Come here, what's going on? Hmm? - I've been thinking about this house. Wondering how long we're gonna be here for. I'm tired of moving, Dad. Ever since Mom moved away, we've lived in so many different places. Now we're in this brand new house and I don't wanna move anymore. - We're not going anywhere honey. We're gonna stay right here. - Promise? - I promise. Give me a hug. It's a proven fact. Bill is a loser. - Gotta get your facts straight, honey. Bill is not a loser. - I hate it here. I don't have any friends. If it weren't for Max, I'd be a total outcast. - What am I, mashed potatoes? - No, but you're with Bill. And he's not half as smart as Dad was. Sometimes I wish I could see him again. Just one more time. God, what a day. - You said you worked things out with Jimmy? - Yeah. If you call missing your father and hating it here working it out. What are you doing, research? - Yeah, I can use all the help I can get. - Honey, you just gotta relax. - Yeah. - And don't worry so much. Just gotta let things happen. - Mm-hmm. All I can tell ya is that for the first time in three years, I have hope. Claire, I don't wanna screw this up. - Hey, just remember, Mr. Sensitive, - Mm. - I didn't marry you because you had hope, I married you 'cause you had a cute ass. Mm. - Bill, Bill? - What? Oh, what's happening? - It's like a hundred degrees in here. Oh, man. Oh. Oh, damn. Todd, you. Aw. Oh. - Daddy. - Oh! - Please, Daddy, help! Daddy, help! Please, help me. Please, Daddy, help. - Jessica? - Daddy, I'm cold. - Jessie? - Bill? I thought you were fixing the air conditioner? - Uh, yeah. Yeah, I have to, I have to fix, ah. I gotta fix a broken circuit breaker switch. - That's okay, that's okay. We'll open some windows. We'll slow roast over night. - Okay. - It's on. - Yeah, this house has a mind of its own. - How's the weather in New York? Yeah, Mom, it's gonna be a great party. - Is that Mom? - Hey, Mom, Todd's here, do you wanna talk to him? Okay, I'll tell him, bye. - What'd you hang up for, spaz? She had to go. Sorry. - Hey, Todd? - What? - Got a pinata outside that needs filling. Whoa, apocalypse. - Bill! Bill, you'd never believe what just happened. - Ah, jeez. Ah. I must have left the parking brake off. - Aw, what are we gonna do? The party's in an hour. - I don't know, Claire. - Where did this thing come from? - It's an old dollhouse I found in the shed. What about this? - Faster, faster! - Backwards, terrific. - One more! - One more, go, go! - Okay, okay. - Go, go! Forward, forward, forward. - No, no. - No, no, no. Other way, other way. Uh, to the left. - Left, left, left. - She's gettin' close, no. Other way. - Right, right, left. Left, okay, right, left. - There, there. - Right, left. - There! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Max, you're smarter than anyone here. Except for me, of course. - Hey, Einstein. Why don't you put your stupid mouse away and come join the party? - I've got a better idea. Why don't you go find yourself an IQ and leave me and my mouse alone? - All right, man, I tried. Oh, you must be Jimmy. Let me get a look at ya. I'm Tobias, that's Marla. Hey, we're your new aunt and uncle. - Oh. - Welcome to the family. - Thanks. - Hey there, little brother. - Hey, Sis. Mm, you look great. - Oh. Aunt Marla! - Happy Birthday, mm. Hey, come over here. So how's it going Tobias? You've got wasps. - Uh, well, I'll look into that. Ooh, very nice, very nice. - Right? Yeah, yeah. It's a little small. - Dad, I wanna open yours now. - Remember honey, it's from all of us. This is a big one. - Oh! - Oh! - You guys, I love it! - Hey, runt, why don't you ask her if you can move in? - That's hysterical, Todd. You really are quite funny. - Oh! - Oh! - Wow. - Okay, who wants cake, hmm? - Yeah. - Todd, Todd, go cut some cake. Okay? - I thought you cleaned it? - I did. - Look at this neat box. - Tobias, that's-- - Not now. I hope you're not too old for this. - No way. Thank you so much. - Oh, you're so welcome. - Lucky. - How did that get in there? Hmm. That oughta do it. Oh, almost. Very close, whoa, easy kiddo, easy. Give me that. Who's next? - Me, me! - Jessica, do you wanna give it a try? - I'll do it. - I don't feel so good. Jimmy. Jim-boy, come on in here and show 'em how it's done, huh? Give him the blindfold there. - Okay. - That's good. - Hit it, hit it. - Would you like to play, sweetheart? - That's good. - Hit it hard, hit it hard. - Spin around, yes. - One, two, three, - Hit it hard. - You're not peaking, are ya? - Four, five. Good, dizzy? Good, okay, all right. - Okay, Jimmy, go ahead. - Are you ready? Take a good shot at it. Nice and straight. - Go, go, Jimmy. - Go, go! - Oh, good one, try again. Try again, one more. - Do it again! - Again, again! One more time. - Candy! - Candy! It's on me! - Oh, geez. - Get it off me! - I'll get it, I'll get it. - Get it off! - Get it, get it! Oh. - Ew. - Jeez, man. You tried to kill me. You knew I was afraid of spiders. - I was trying to help you, man. Todd, you're in big trouble now. - Dad, I put a fake spider in there as a joke, but it was rubber, not real. - This is no joke. Upstairs to your room, you're grounded for a month. But Bill, I don't, really. - Upstairs, now! - I can't believe you. - Aunt Marla, I'm, I'm really sick. - Hmm. Hey, how's she doing? - She's completely unbalanced. Tomorrow I'll bring by some special tea. Oh, relax. It's just some herbs and medicinal roots. Maybe a little arsenic thrown in for texture. - Very funny. In the meantime, I have just the thing to reduce your fever. - I hope it's not too weird. - No, weird is an understatement. This is a very powerful, ancient remedy. They call it children's aspirin. You take those and try to get some sleep, okay? - Okay. - All right. Bill, don't you think the dollhouse would be better off in a larger room? - No, I want it to stay in here. - Whoa, sis, whoa, easy, easy. - Oh, oh, is it warm in here? Am I'm having a hot flash. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, I, um, I guess it's been a rough day. Get some rest now. - Okay, little brother. Talk to me. Something's wrong. - No, it's just stress. Uh, okay. I'm having my dreams again. - Like when you were a kid? - Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. It's just the stress, though. You know, it's just, it's the move is a lot tougher than I thought it was gonna be. - You know, I have the most vivid memory of you when you were little. Yeah? - Always building something. - Oh. Here we go. - Remember that castle you built out of tree twigs once? - Yeah, Fort Birch, I called it. - Mm. You insisted on putting a large flag right through the top of it. - Mm-hmm. - And I told you if you did, it would crumble under the weight of it. - Which is exactly what I did. I put a large flag right on top of it. - Mm-hmm. - Crumbled under the weight. Just like you said. - Be careful, Bill. Your family's more delicate than you think. When I was in Jessica's room, I received some strange vibrations off that dollhouse. And it definitely was not a hot flash. You felt it at the party too, didn't you? - Like a nail through my forehead. I'll look into it. Todd? Hey, Todd? Todd, open the door, will ya? Todd, open the door, I'm coming in. - Don't you ever knock? - I knocked 10 times. I wanna talk to you about the spider incident. - Yeah, well I don't. - Todd, you're digging yourself a deeper hole here. - Well give me a shovel. - I want you to go apologize to Jimmy right now. - No, no way. I'm not helping you score brownie points with your new son. Forget it. - Please stop. - Don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Son of a bitch! - What's going on? Oh, this, dammit. - What? - How did you do that? Ah, that's one hell of a Santa Ana. - Dad, you're, you're nose, it's bleeding. - Oh, man, no kidding. - Hey, Dad? I'm sorry. Jimmy? - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. It wasn't one of my better parties. - Bill overreacted if you ask me. Dad never lost it like that. He was always in control. - You'd be surprised. - What do you mean? - Nevermind. Listen, it's getting late. Why don't you get some rest, okay? - Okay. - Okay, good night, sweetie. - Good night, Mom. Max? - Max, what are you doing here? You like the dollhouse too. That's my room. Help, help! What's wrong, Jess? - It's under my bed. - Hey, what's going on? What's going on here? Huh, huh? - I don't know, Dad, there's something under that bed, it's like a giant raccoon or something. - No, Dad, it was Max. - He's dead! Oh, shit. - Dude, I'm sorry, man. - No you're not! You've hated me ever since I got here. You killed him! - But it was an accident. - You're just lying to defend him. - Jimmy, Jessica doesn't lie. - Yeah, right, Bill. - Jimmy. - Honey, let me talk to him. - Dad, it was an accident, I swear. - I know. - Watch out, Todd. - So much for the giant rat. - But it was there. You saw it. - I don't know, Jess. - Todd? I'm scared. - Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Jim. Todd didn't mean to hurt Max. - He didn't hurt him, he killed him. There's a notable difference. - Look, I'm not trying to take Todd's side in this thing. - I'm just trying-- - Yes, you are. You're defending that Neanderthal. I hate it here so much. - Well then why don't you tell me what you'd like me to do to make it better for you, okay? - I want you to leave me alone. That's what I want. - All right. I'm sorry about Max. - Whatever. Dad, Dad! But, but, Dad, you, you're dead. - Shh. Not so loud, Jim. - You can't be real. - I'm here, aren't I? - Feels like a dream. - A dream that's come true. - I've missed you so much. - How have you been? - I've been bad. I mean, I hate my life. I hate this house. I hate everybody here. Except for Mom, of course. - Don't you like Bill? - Huh, are you kidding? He's the biggest loser of them all. - Maybe that's because he doesn't care about you, Jim. The truth is, he wants to take your mom away from you. - Yeah, that's just what I've been thinking. But who cares, Dad, now that you're here. Wait until Mom sees. - No, no, no, no. Don't say anything just yet. This will be our little secret. We have plans to make. Plans about what to do with Bill. Maybe what happened to Max should happen to Bill. - But Dad, wait, I. Unbelievable. - This is a nightmare, Claire. - Hey, I figure 10, 12 years, the kids are outta here. - Mm. - Hmm? - How do you do it, huh? - Mm. I think about how hard you're trying to make this work for all of us. - I love you. - Mm. Oh, yeah, you feel so good. Am I doing this right? - I don't know. - Hey, Claire. Look, um, about Jimmy's mouse. I didn't mean to hurt him. - I'm not mad at you Todd. Can't you wait until I'm finished? - What's your problem? - Nothing. Just go back to bed. - This family is so fucked up. Not funny, Dana. It was so funny. - My parents are asleep upstairs. - So what? - So how'd you get in here? - I found the key. - Aw, you. Come on, let's go. - Okay, let's go outside. God, it reeks. - Mm. - Oh, take it easy there. - Wow, this is cool. Hey, look at this. Eh, I love bugs. Well that's a whole lotta bug to love. - Yeah. Hey, that's your fireplace. Did your dad build a house on this burned down lot? - Yeah, he did. Saved us a ton of money using the original fireplace. But it's not that interesting. - No. - I never liked that shirt anyway. - What was that? How am I supposed to know? - Are you sure that thing was dead? - As dead as this town on a Saturday night. Get out! - Todd, come on! - Just go! Todd! - It's in his ear! - Hold his head. I'll douse it. It wasn't dead. That thing wasn't dead. - Okay. - Is it okay? Good, good. Easy. Todd? The guy in the emergency room said he's never seen one like it. Todd's asleep. - You know he spends too much time with Dana. She's trouble. She's not good for him. He can do a whole lot better. They're gonna burn. - Don't, don't. What's happening to me? Okay, guys. I have pancakes. - I'm going to my room. I don't feel so good. - I'm not hungry. - I'm gonna do the dishes. - I'm going outside. I need some fresh air. - Good morning, Jimmy. Morning. Huh, what's up with boy genius? - Hmm, don't ask. - I brought Jess over some of that tea I talked about. - Yeah, well, you might as well take it upstairs. She's not feeling any better today. - Hmm. This whole family needs their chakras realigned. Hey, are you okay? - Yeah. - Did you cut yourself? Uh-uh. Listen, I'm gonna go do some shopping. - Can I come along? Marla can watch the kids. - No, that's okay. I need to be alone. - Great. - What's the matter baby? You're troubled, aren't you? - I'm just a little scared. That's all. - Is it the dollhouse? - How did you know? - Just called it a hunch. - I think it's magical. Its windows open by themselves, and it turned Jimmy's baby mouse into a huge monster mouse. You believe me, don't you? - Oh, honey, I more than believe you. Look, I tell you what, why don't we just get this thing out of your room, huh? - See, I told you. What are we gonna do now? - Jess, I want you to make a list of all the strange things it does. You think you can do that for me, sweetheart? - Yeah. Write down everything unusual. Just like a real detective. - Yeah. I'll be back later, okay? Okay. - What could be in here? Ow. Rule number one, don't touch the attic door. Did you bring me what I need? - I took it from the dollhouse. - All right, I'll see what I can see. - Looking good. - Oh, hey Claire. - Hey. - Ah, listen, let's bury the hatchet. Come on, play some one on one with me. - I don't think so. - Come on, Dad says you're good. - Ah, dammit, let me go. - You know, Claire, I thought you were gonna be cool. I was wrong. - What's happening to me? - Claire? Claire? Claire? I finally fixed the gas line. Unbelievable how high the pressure was. So how are you doin'? What, what? Oh, oh, Claire. I've never seen you like this. Claire, are you okay? What's, what's wrong? - I guess I'm just not used to a house full of kids. - Then we need to be alone, huh? Todd, you got the number for restaurant, right? - Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it. - Good, listen, I've been doing some thinking, and I think you and Dana should call it quits for a while. - Hey, look, Dad, um-- - No, you should stop seeing Dana until you learn to be a little bit more responsible. - I totally understand. - You do? - Yeah, oh, she's history anyways. Too much trouble. If you know what I mean. - Yeah, good, good. - Ready. - Hey, you look great. - Thanks. - Thanks for watching the kids. - Yeah, no problem. - Bye, Todd. - Good night, Claire. Have a nice dinner. All right, midgets. Game over, go to bed. What, did I stutter? Let's go, come on, go to bed. Oh. - Upstairs, come on. Bedtime for you guys. It's getting late. Come on. - It's only eight o'clock. - I don't wanna go to my room. You can't make me. Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I don't like my room anymore. - That's too bad 'cause you're going. And I can make you. And if I catch either of you two down here, you're dead meat. - Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow then. - Good night, Jimmy. - Fascinating. Dad. - I'm digging the hole for us, Jim. For us. - You're starting to really scare me Dad. - Don't you see what's going on here? Your mom has forgotten all about me. Bill will get you to do the same. You'll forget I ever existed. - No, I won't. I'll never forget. - Bill has to be removed. - I won't do it. - Get with the program, boy. You must not miss me. - But I do. I miss you. - Then kill him, Jim. Kill him for me. You can't make me do it. - Do it for me, Jimmy. You'll feel a whole lot better if you do. You'll feel a whole lot better if you do. - What's going on with us, Claire? - I don't know, it's like we're falling apart before we've even begun. Oh, man. I have a feeling I'm totally out of control here. And my motto is if it's broken, I'll fix it. - I remember this. Us laughing. Enjoying each other. I actually feel kinda normal right now. - Honey, what I'm gonna tell you right now is gonna sound a little crazy. - Nothing's gonna sound crazy to me at this point. - Well, I had this bad dream. - That's it? - That's a lot. I haven't had a dream like this since I was 10 years old. Do you remember how I told you that my mom and dad died? - In the house fire. - Yeah, yeah. Well, I had this dream that the house was burning and I told my parents about it, and I told 'em that we should get out and they didn't believe me. And the next day, the house went up like a match when I was at school. Marla says I have these gifts, you know. Whatever they are, they're driving me out of my mind. - What's it telling you now? - It's telling me that, that I'm gonna lose you. - Oh. - That I'm gonna lose all of you. - Oh, oh, Bill. - Ah, what took you so long? I've been waiting out there forever. - Hey, dweeb removal takes time. - So, how long do we have? - Long enough. - Cool. - I'm not afraid of you. Go ahead, do something. I dare you. Rule number two, it listens. - Gosh, it's good to see you laugh. I thought I was boring you to death. - No, I was just thinking. For some reason, I feel right at home in this house. - This house gives me the creeps. You know, as a matter of fact, I've thinking about taking off. As in permanently. - You just don't know how good you've got it, do you? Okay, look at my life. I don't have a father, and my loving mother kicks me out of the house every time one of her boyfriends comes over. I would die to have a family like yours. You just don't get it. Here isn't so bad, Todd. I'm here. - You're the only reason I'm still around. - Hey. - Hmm? - Why don't you go get us a drink. - All right. - Hey, Todd? How do you turn this thing on? - Oh, the switch is on the wall. ♪ Here I go Hey, how strong do you want these? The stronger the better. Right. Right. Ooh. I'm not afraid. Go ahead, do something. I dare you. I'll be right there. Oh, yeah, party time. Oh. - Todd, are you okay? - Kids, go upstairs and stay there. Jimmy, call 911! Go, Jess. - It hurts. - I'm gonna go with her. - No, I'm going with her. - No, no, Todd you stay here. I'm gonna go with her. - No, I'm going with her. - Todd, you stay here. - You stay here. You stay here, Todd. - You know, this is all your fault. - Todd. - This is all your fault! You and your goddamn gas lines. - Todd, Todd! - I wish you never built this fucking house. - Todd, Todd. - Let him go. Let him go. - All right. - Get him strapped in. Let's go. - All right, let's go. Move it out. - You did this. Give me that. Whoa. My hand disappears in the fireplace. - Who is it? - Hey. - Hi, Mom. Todd told me you called 911. - Oh, it was no big deal. - Oh, it's pretty brave of you. - Mom, I. I'm tired. - Okay, honey. It's late. Get some sleep. I hope Dana's gonna be okay. Yeah, me too. It's pretty horrible, huh? - I can think of worse. Please don't come out. Please. - Ready? - As ready as I'll ever be. Open to me the secret way. Oh. It can't escape the pentagram. - I'm not sure it needs to. Marla? - Go to them, Tobias. Go. - Hey. - Hey. - So how's Dana doing? - She's in a coma. I'll tell Todd in the morning. I'll get ready for bed. No, no, please, please! - Mm. Mm. - No! No! No, please! We have to get outta here. - I'm doing this for us, Jim. It's payback time. - Dad, no! Dad! Bill! - Oh, honey, did you have a bad dream? - I'll go. - Is that how I raised you? To be a little girl? Jimmy? - That your new best friend, Jim? - No, Dad. - Well it sure sounds like it to me. Jimmy. Hey, Jim, open up, let's talk, buddy. Come on, buddy. Let's talk, all right? Jim. Jimmy. Jimmy, out! - Hey, Mr. Brady. Let's have a little pow wow. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. - Hey, I thought Bill came to see. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he hit you, that bastard. - Mom, Dad hit me. - You mean Bill hit you. - No, it was Dad. Dad hit me. - Don't you defend him. - They're coming for you Bill. And they are gonna eat your soul. - Oh, my God. - Hey, Claire-- - How dare you hit him? - What, I didn't hit him. - How dare! - I want you out. - I didn't, Claire! I didn't, dammit! - Get out, get out! - Claire, I didn't do it! - I said, get out! - Come on, dammit, I-- - You asshole! - I had a dream, dammit! - Fuck your dreams! - Claire! - Just get out! Dad, no. - Claire, Claire, Claire! Come on! - Glad to see I still excite you Claire. - Mom. - Please leave me alone. Please, leave me alone. Please, leave me alone. Oh. No! - Jess? And when she got home, she built a very big, big fire in the fireplace. All right, Jim. We're getting to the best part. This is where the evil witch throws Hansel into the fire. - Stop it. - Oh, Claire, I thought you used to love our quiet little evenings by the fire. - Don't do this! - But Claire, we're going to the other side. Don't worry, it only hurts forever. - Dana? What are you doing here? I thought you were in the hospital. I had to get out of there, Todd. There was so many sick people. - But I saw you, you, you were hurt. Shh, let's just pick up where we left off. - He got the wife. My family. They're gonna burn, just like-- - No, no, that's not gonna happen. I'll take that. We don't have much time. - All right. Let's find Jessica. - Let's try that again. - Let go! Hey! Let him go. - Wait your turn, Bill. Not so fast, big boy. - Oh, let me go! - Are you okay? - The doll, get the doll. - Maggot brain. You're history. - You can't do this, Jim. I'm your father. - No you're not. My father's dead. - So beautiful. I love you so much. - Thanks, Bill. - I'm proud of you buddy. Go, go. - The dollhouse. We have to get it. - Jessica's room. - I'll get Todd. - Okay, let's go. - They're coming for you. - Come on. Come on, we gotta get outta here. Come on, come on, Todd. I knew she wasn't good enough for you. - Ready? Where is she? Jessica? Tobias, she made notes on the dollhouse. Downstairs, she's in the fireplace! She's not upstairs. It's okay, we're gonna find her. You two, get out of the house, now. - No, I'm staying. - No. - Claire, we gotta get out of this house. That's what I'm saying. Come on, Claire. Let's go! - This was in my dream. - Daddy. Please help me. - She's in there. This is a portal. - If it's a portal, it's the welcome mat to hell. - No, I saw this in my dreams! Help me. Please, please, help me. Please Daddy, help me. Daddy, I'm over here, help. Help me, Daddy. - Jessie. - Daddy, I'm here. Oh, honey. - I think I like it better where they went. Ah, Tobias. - Damn, that was hot. - Daddy, where are we? - I don't know, honey, I don't know. I've seen this place in my dreams. - I've seen it too. This is a place of evil. - Tobias, what is this? - Husks. It's bad. - I saw them being born. - Ah, yeah. - What are these things? - You don't wanna know. Demons, a small one, the size of a rat just about killed Marla and me. - These, there are-- - Much bigger, Daddy. - We need to get outta here. - There's four. I saw it in the dollhouse. - It's locked. - Wait. They won't cross into the light. Look that way, Daddy. It opens the other way in my dollhouse. Go, you must burn the dollhouse. - Tobias, Tobias, I'm not leaving you here. - Bill, you have to save your family. You bastards! That way, run, go, go! Go on, Jessie, go. Get outta here! Jessica, go outside, now! Go honey. Run to Mommy! - Let's go, Bill. Where is he? - Come on, Bill. Let's go, Bill. Oh, Bill! Oh! - Daddy, are you okay? - Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Let's get outta here. - Is it over? - Yes, honey, it's over. - Inside, honey, inside. You and your damn farmhouse. - That's okay, as long as we're together. We can build another house. - Hey, next time, let's just rent. You know, Todd, I've been thinking. That house was definitely not up to code. You're father's a great guy, but the fact that he got a contractor's license is scary. You're sure right, little brother.
