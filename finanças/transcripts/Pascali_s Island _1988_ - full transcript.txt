Good evening, Mr. Mardosian. -Mr. Pascali. -I see we have a new arrival. I take it you are referring to the Englishman. English, is he? Tall. Fair-haired. Mr. Bowles. He's, staying long? An indefinite stay, he said. Indefinite? I trust you gave him a good room. Number 16, overlooking the sea. Did he say why he's here? The reason for his visit? I believe the gentleman is an archeologist. A scholar, no less. Perhaps I can be of service to him. Perhaps. Why don't you ask him yourself? You'll find him on the veranda. The veranda. Thank you. Excuse me sir, may I have a word with you? Yes, of course. My name is Pascali, Basil Pascali. You are newly arrived on the island, I believe. I thought, since I speak English, after a fashion, you might need some help. The services of an interpreter,or guide, perhaps? If I can be of any assistance to you. I live here in the town. I'm a well-known figure on the island. Everybody knows me. Everybody knows Basil Pascali. Well, that's very kind of you, Mr. Pascali. My name is Bowles, Anthony Bowles. Very pleased to meet you. I was just about to have a drink, -would you care to join me? -Thank you, yes. I see you are... familiar with our customs. I've traveled extensively -in this part of the world. -Indeed! - What will you have?- The Turks have strengthened their garrison. Only last week a platoon was ambushed in the mountains. The rebels are active. Very active. Who's the German? Herr Gesing. He represents the firm of Mandveld... Armaments.He's placed here on the island. Your English is extremely good. Passable, passable, yes. My mother was, half Irish. Half Irish, half French. She came out to Constantinople as a dancer and an acrobat -in a traveling show. -You don't say. That offer of yours, to act as interpreter, awfully decent of you. I may well take you up on it. At your service. I have a spot of business to conduct here. It's a question of making an approach -to the Turkish authorities. -The authorities? Yes. Lydia! Lydia Neuman, Viennese. She has a house with a studio in the Turkish Quarter. Basil. I see you've found someone new. Good evening, Lydia. This is... Anthony Bowles. Lydia Neuman. Lydia is an artist. A very fine painter. And Basil is my kindest critic. Would you care to join us for a drink? Thank you. Lydia is from an old Viennese family. One of the best. Basil, please. She was educated in England. Really? -So, what will you have? -White wine. Mr. Pascali was just telling meabout his mother. One of his favorite topics. Apparently she was an acrobat. An acrobat? You told me she was a piano teacher. My mother had many professions, in a long and varied career. She ended up in the oldest one of all, she became a prostitute. I really don't thinkMiss Neuman wants to hear that. I have no idea who my father was, what race, or background. My mother gave me different accounts at different times. She was a great one for stories. A talent you inherited at least. Eventually, to cut a long story short, she became the mistress of an official in the Ministry of Finance, a Maltese by the name of Pascali. Take no notice of him. He's only trying to shock you. On the contrary. Madame. And, will you be staying here for long, Mr. Bowles? Possibly for a week or two, this whole area's rich in historical antiquities. Are you an archeologist? How fascinating. Yes, I'm gathering material for a book about classical antiquities along the coast of Asia Minor -and here on the island. -Excuse me. -Curious fellow. -Basil? He's a fixture of the island. Our local character. What does he do? He teaches French, German, English. He manages to scrape a living somehow. I was thinking of asking him to interpret for me in some negotiations, I'd pay him, of course. Please do. It would be wonderful for him. Lord of the World, shadow of God on Earth, God bring you increase. You do not know me, Excellency. I am your secret observer on this island. One of them, at least, for there may be others. Forgive my temerity in addressing you. I am driven to it. I can no longer endure the neglect of your officials. In spite of repeated humble requests, no word has come to me from the Ministry, no single word of acknowledgement. Never. Not from the beginning. Twenty years, I have sat here at my table, in my room above the shore, on this island, far from Constantinople and the centers of power. This is my last report. The Greeks suspect me, Excellency, I am sure of it. The American's yacht is still there. Ten days now, fishing for sponges, or so he claims. He has a crew of three. Two Italians and a Pole, they say. And what of our fine upstanding Englishman? What is he doing here? An indefinite stay, that in itself is suspicious. And the gun? No. He has some other purpose in mind. Basil, what a surprise. -I'm not disturbing you? -No. No, I was working. Come. Come on in. Tell me, what do you think. Come on, be honest. You know how much I value your opinion. It's very fine. You don't think this red is too strong, -a little violent? -No, it's wonderful! Very sensual. I'm so glad you came by. I haven't much on today. You can tell me all the latest gossip. I've been wondering about the yacht in the bay. It's owned by an American. Have you met him, this Mr. Smith? Yes. I mean, no. Not exactly. I spoke to one of his crew, an Italian. He came ashore for provisions two or three days ago. Do you think the sponge fishingis genuine? Yes of course, why not? I've heard rumors. They say he's running guns to the rebels. Basil, your imagination is running wild. I mean, if they thought that, they would've boarded him and searched him. -Apparently they have done that.-And did they find anything? -No. -Exactly. Tell me, what do you think of our new arrival? The Englishman? A typical product of his race, I would say, somewhat naive, a trifle self-righteous. Yes, he's... unsophisticated in some ways. A moral primitive. Why do you think he's here? He told us last night. He's interested in the ruins, he's writing a book. Of course. Why don't you ask him yourself? I'm expecting him here any minute. I'm sorry. I have a suspicious mind. For centuries the Turks have ruled. Now the empire is in decay, and the Europeans are gathering like vultures, squabbling over the pickings. You're part European yourself, Basil. Or are you forgetting? I no longer know what I am. Hello. You found it. The door was open, I... Come up, we're up here. Mr. Pascali. Mr. Bowles Basil, would you be an angel and get Mr. Bowles -a glass of wine? -Of course. I'm sorry, I didn't realize. No, it's all right, Basil's an old friend. -May I? -Please. I'm impressed. Basil says this red is very sensual. See this beautiful fabric, I bought it in Tangier. Have you ever been there? It's one of my favorite cities. It's mine too. It's so beautiful, the way they sing in the morning, all over the city, from those, towers. What are they called? Minuets? Minarets. Yes, minarets. Yes. I've been up on the headlandsto see the ruins. They're quite extensive. I don't believe anyone has really studied them. And you would like to. Yes, I would. What I want is to obtain some kind of lease, for a month so that I can come and go as I please. The land belongs to Mahut Pasha,the island's governor. He owns a great deal of land, all along the coast. Well, Pasha can be approached, I suppose? I-I-I would advise you to stay clear of him. -He's all-powerful here. -Nevertheless. They won't allow you to remove anything from the site, for that you would have to getpermission from Constantinople. Hey! Well, I realize that. I've nointention of doing any digging. In that case, excuse me, I see no point. You already have free access to the area. No, I must have a lease. I must have the legal right. Well, if you really think it's necessary. I think it's the best policy in the end. And what I'm going to need is an interpreter. And I was wondering if your offer still stands. - For a suitable fee, of course.-No, no, no! Yes. I must insist on that. Well, that's very kind of you, naturally, if I can help. I will arrange a meeting. Ha! I am explaining about the lease. Tell them I should feel myself to be trespassing on the Pasha's property if I had not paid a proper sum for the right of access. I was thinking of something in the region of 500 lira. Five hundred Liras! But that's more than the land is worth. Listen, you are offering far too much. Leave things to me. Offer them 500 lira. It seems to me a fair price. But that's more than the land could be sold for. Such an offer would make them suspicious. I think not. Please do as I asked. Very well. I could perhaps improve on that. No. No, they will accept. He accepts, as a gesture of friendship. Would you thank the Pasha for meand tell him I'm most grateful. - Contract? - Yes. He asks if the contract is necessary. Absolutely, I must have a legal document. He asks when you can pay the money. I can pay a deposit, say five percent when the contract is signed. The balance may take a few days longer. I shall have to arrangea transfer of funds from London. But I have no intention of arranging for that transfer until the contract is signed, otherwise the deal is off. The contract will be ready at five o'clock at his office in the town. Thank you. What does it say here? Does it cover everything? I think so. The area is precisely defined, the sums and dates correctly stated. It specifically excludes any building operations, or mining or excavation. And where is the Pasha's signature? Here, here. That is his official seal. -So it's all in order? -It would appear so. Be careful, Mr. Bowles. I do not know what you are intending, but the Pasha is not a man to be crossed. Mr. Pascali, I am an archeologist. Keeping you busy this week. First the Englishman, and now me. -Englishman? -Mr. Bowles. Hasn't he been in? He was having money sent from London, 500 liras. Not this bank. But there is no other bank. Excellency Most High, why have you abandoned me? I was 25 when I was established here on the island, at a rate of remuneration sufficient for my needs at the time. Ever since that day, I have performed my duties faithfully, watching over the loyalty of your subjects, documenting the activities of foreign visitors, priding myself on the reliability of my observations. Yet, there has always been silence, the money every month through the Banque Ottomane not increasing in spite of my appeals. No word of acknowledgement. Not one of my reports acted upon. Only... silence. Where did you and your charming wife meet? It was over the holidays, five years ago. Basil! Come and join us! Yeah. - I was on my way to-- - No, no, no. - We're over here. - Do join us, Basil. Hello, Pascali. Mr. Bowles. Monsieur. - Sir. - Herr Gesing. I found you a rich American widow. Mrs. Marchant, let me introduceyou to Basil Pascali, one of the fixtures of the island! Slightly more mobile than that I hope. You're so lucky to be living here. Basil is a gentleman of leisure. It's such a spiritual landscape, sort of fused with... spirit. I think it's so important to keep in touch with the spiritual side of life, don't you? I'm a practical man myself, you know, both feet on the ground. Well, I'm not sure that you're quite as uncomplicated as you want everyone to think. I'm afraid I am what you see. You've just been in Constantinople, Monsieur Chaudan. What's happening there? There are... elements in the Army who wish to impose a constitution. I think it is only a matter of time before the Sultan is deposed. For 30 years they are saying this. Still he is there. The Turks think he's next to God. And those in his empire who are not Turks? I don't think his passing will be greatly mourned, -Herr Gesing. -You think I care? Things will go on just as before, with the Sultan or without him. Feelings are running high among the Greeks here on the island. It would end in a bloodbath. A bloodbath? I fear so. We Irish understand the frustrations of an occupied people. Well, I hope nothing happens while I'm here. What's that singing? Tomorrow is Good Friday. They have the custom of bearing an icon of Christ around the town the night before. How wonderful! Will we see anything? They should be passing this way. Really! The researches? They are going well here? Yes, very well. Do you go there often? Everyday? It is interesting for you? Very interesting. Look! How beautiful! I'm so fascinated by these age-old religious practices. There's a service tomorrow at the church. Mrs. Marchant, why don't you ask Basil to take you? If you'd like to go, I'd... accompany you with pleasure. Thank you, I'd love to! Shouldn't we be making a move? - Yes. - Are we going? Yes. - Good night, Pascali.-Bye, Dr. Hogan. Thank you so much, it was delightful. Lovely to see you again, Lydia. -Bye, Basil. -Dr. Hogan, really sometime... -Good night, monsieur. -Good night, Mrs. Herr Gesing. -Mr. Pascali, good night. -Good night, my dear. - Good night, everyone. - Good night. I, too, should be on my way. The great interpreter. Yes, as you say. -Sit down. -I really should be-- Sit down! For a minute. There's something I have to say to you. What is it? This lease, this famous lease... it's not legal, Pascali. -Not valid. -Not valid? -They had no right. -But I was only the... intermediary. There are other interests involved. Powerful interests. He must be persuaded quietly from the land. Removed. It is dangerous for him. You do this for me... and I will pay you. Pay me? Yeah. Pay you. You rise up out of that water like Venus! My goodness, it's quite a climb. It's not far, now. Look at all those knives. Extraordinary variety. They are sacrificial knives. Sacrificial? For the cutting of sheep's throats. - No. - It's tradition to buy a new weapon every Bayram. The knife makers do a roaring trade. That has nothing to do with what we're about to see. No, no, it's a Muslim practice. I see. What did he say? Nothing, it's not important. Thank you. Mr. Pascali? Mr. Pascali?! "Dear Pascali, something has come up. I'd be grateful if you'd arrange a further meeting with the Pasha at the earliest opportunity. Sincerely, Anthony Bowles." Well, the fact is you better tell them I found some objects on the site. Objects? On the site they leased to me, they're of considerable archeological importance. - What kind of objects? - They may be of great significance. The point is, I want them to change the leaseso I have the right to excavate. Of course, I'm willing to pay more, whatever they think fit. He asks, "Are the objects valuable?" I suppose so, it depends upon the material. Some are priceless. I shan't know what the answer isuntil I start digging. -Are the objects large? -I have them here in my bag. I would be willing to double the sum. Perhaps I might lay the objectson the desk? Do you mind? Thank you. - He remarks that it's gold. - It's gold, all right. The stones, of course, are turquoise. Now this... this is probably the most valuable find of all, from an archeological point of view. He asks if there is more gold. Almost certainly. If I am allowed to dig. They are accusing you, saying that the objects belong to the government. Well, I am aware of that. And I intend to see that they are handed over to the proper authorities in Constantinople. I shall apply to them for permission to excavate, if need be. He asks if you have told anyone yet. No. Not yet. They want to know if you have the documents with you. For God's sake, say no! You can tell them the contract and the receipt are deposited under seal with instructions to forward to the British Consul at Smyrna in the event of my not returning. They say you will never get the permits before the lease expires. Well, in that case, I shall simply have to report the matter to the Ministry, and they will do the excavating. Pity, because I would have likedto be associated with these finds, especially if they turn out, as I think they will, to be the first importance. The lease has three weeks to run! He says the land is his property. Not for the next three weeks it isn't. Good day, gentlemen. They say they will buy the lease back. Buy it? So they want the creditfor the discoveries themselves. Well, this does put a new slant on things. In view of the inconvenience, the disruption of my research, not to mention my disappointment, I shall have to ask rather more than I gave. I think 2,000 Lira would be a fair price. Tell them they have until noon tomorrow. I shall wait at my hotel. They're offering 800. Eight hundred? That isn't enough. They really can't expect me to-- Look, my research, the whole progress of my book will have been held up and then there's the disappointment. I'm... Don't they understand? I'm being deprived of material that could affectour knowledge of a whole period. I'm sorry, 800 simply isn't good enough. No, my dear chap, I must have 2,000, at least. Well, that is my figure. And by the way,I've been out there this morning and I see you've stationed two soldiers on the site. He says he knows nothing about any soldiers. He can say what he likes, the fact is they're there. And there is nothing in our agreement about a military presence. He says he's authorized to offer 1,500 lira. He says it's their final offer.I think it probably is. Fifteen hundred. Very well, I accept. It's not enough, but I really don't want to haggle. We are to collect the money at 7:00 at his office here in the town. Seven o'clock it is. Good. He asks that you bring the documents with you. Of course. This calls for a drink. One would almost say that you have been through this kindof thing before. Good heavens, no. What makes you say that? I don't know. The way you handled it. What about the soldiers? They're bivouacked up there on the site. Terrified I'm going to cart the stuff off. You wouldn't do that. No, of course not, but you knowwhat those people are like. Beer. I'm very grateful for your help. When things are finally settled, I'll see that you don't go unrewarded. These Turks, they're so absolutely, totally mercenary. There's no spark of... Well, I know it's an old-fashioned word, but there doesn't seem to be any concept of honor amongst them. No wonder the Ottoman Empire is breaking up if what I've just seen is an example. That head. You brought it with you. I beg your pardon? You brought it with you. You didn't find it here. You needn't keep up this pretense with me. What pretense? What are you talking about? That marble head. That head you produced from your bag with the air of a conjurer, if I may say so. That selfsame head was in your possession when you set foot on the island. And so, by inference, were all the other objects which you laid on the Pasha's desk. You must have a reason for saying this. I found the head in your room,the first night you arrived. Did you? What were you looking for? Are you a police agent? I have nothing to do with the police. Some kind of informer, anyway. No, not some kind. The best kind. I am the best kind. An informer. And you are a swindler. The lawsagainst that kind of thing are severe in the domains of the Sultan, not to say savage. A word from me would be enough to spoil your game here and lose you all the money. Seven hundred. I want 700 liras. That is fair, I think. Have you told anyone else? About finding the head, I mean. No. But I've lefta written account of everything in a sealed envelope with forwarding instructions in the event of my disappearance or death. I very much doubt it. Still, I'll give you 400. You're entitled to something, anyway. Five hundred and fifty. I won't take a piaster less. Five hundred. Contingent on the deal with the Pasha going through. Done. Five hundred liras. More money than I have seen in my entire life. Money enough to leave this island, come to Constantinople, discover even the fate of my reports. We are accomplices now, he and I. That linking of destiny of which I spoke has come to pass. Mr. Pascali.You are waiting for Mr. Bowles. -Yes. -He's not coming. -He sends this message. -Not coming? He has to come. "Unavoidably detained. The troops are still on the site. Tell them I refuse to negotiate until these troops are removed. Tell them it's a matter of principle." So, you were saying about your father? I was 14 when he died. There was no money, so I workedin an insurance office in the city of London. God, I hated it. Totaling up figures all day long. - And I was there for ten years.-Ten years! Then my mother died. Ten wasted years. -What happened then? -I gave it up. And soon you will be off on your travels again. I never stay long in one place. And I never visit the same place twice. Tell me, the American, Smith? Can he be trusted? Whose side is he on? The Greeks, of course, he's supplying their guns. Certainly not the Turks. Well, that's business.Does he believe in their cause? I should think so. He combines idealism with commerce. It's the American way. Well, I have a proposition for him. Do you think you could affect an introduction? Yes, if you want it. How do you know he supplies their guns? Because I paid for them. -Mr. Bowles? -Pascali! What happened to you? Last night. - I was hung up. You got my note.-Yes but, -I have to talk to you. -All right, if we're quick. I have to be somewhere in half an hour. They've been all over the town looking for you. They are furious about last night. You must get this thing finished today, this morning. They are dangerous people. I know them. We'll lose the money and get ourthroats cut into the bargain. You must give them the documents. I'd like to leave it for a day or two, old chap. Leave it? But why? Well, I haven't finished my research yet. Your researches? Please, listen to me. Time is everything. They are certain to suspect something -if you delay. -Suspect what? Didn't I make it clear? I'm writing a book. What if you did? What's your book to them? You thought the whole thing was a fabrication, I suppose. I don't know. I don't know what's happening. Why did you not make this clear before? Look, if it'll set your mind at rest, you can give them -my word. -What? Give them my word of honor I won't remove any of the treasures from the site. But there are no treasures on the site. True, that's quite true, of course. But they don't know that, do they? Couple of days, that's all I need. A couple of days? A couple more days won't kill them. It's not them I'm worried about. Have a little faith, Pascali. - Someone has to show them. - Show them? -Show them what? -The Turks. You know, show them. Trust me, will you? There's really nothing to worry about. Basil, wait! I'm coming down. Thank you. Lydia, do you ever think of leaving the island? That's an extraordinary question. -Why do you ask? -I sense it. I've often thought of you and I on this island, each in our separate lives. We're both misfits in a way. Maybe we are. That's why we like each other. Why did you come here, if I may ask? What were you escaping from? Why should I be escaping? Maybe I came here to find something. And did you? Find it? Almost. Almost. I'm so tired, Basil. This island was my sanctuary. Here, I'm free to be whatever I choose to be. Free. You need something to be free for. I need... something. My life has been a disappointment. I'm sure you understand. I'm sorry. Maybe it will change. I don't think so. Somehow, I don't think so. - Ja?Who is this? - Basil Pascali. -Am I disturbing you? -What do you want? If I may come in? It is about the proposition you made, concerning the Englishman. He's still there. They cannot get rid of him. He has the lease. What lease? It's not worth the paper it's written on. In that case, why is the Pasha so anxious to get it back? Because he had no right. No right? It is his land. No, Pascali. It isn't his land. He has already sold it. It belongs to the government. To the Sultan. -I don't understand. -No, my friend. It is well you do not. Such knowledge could be dangerous. For whom? For you, for a lot of people. Listen, Pascali. You know this Mr. Bowles. Find out what it is he wants. What he's after. He's in the way of everybody. I'll see what I can do. I warn you. Speak of this to nobody. Herr Gesing, what is Terra Rossa? Careful, Pascali. You are skating on hot water. -Thin ice. -What? I am skating on thin ice. Who's there? Come out or I'll shoot. It is I, Pascali. What the devil are you doing here? I wanted know what would induce a man to risk losing so much money. I have an interest, after all. Well, you better come down. Marvelous, isn't it? Too early to identify the period yet, of course. Yes. It's very fine. Bronze. It is bronze, you know, not stone. Beautiful. Yes, isn't he? Terra Rossa. That's right. It contains Bauxite. -Bauxite? -Yes, used in the manufacture of aluminum. I think I must leave now. It is very hot down here. Regular sun-trap. Just a minute. Pascali... I owe you an explanation. I'd like to talk to you. I'd like to explain all this. Will you come to my hotel this evening for a drink? -About 9:00, if that suits. -Very well. In the meantime, keep this to yourself. Of course. You'll be the loser if you don't. You'll lose everything. Who is it? It is I, Basil Pascali. Come in. It's open. Yes. Someone's been having a damn good look through my things. Is there anything missing? Not as far as I can see. There's nothing much here except for a few clothes. I always travel light. Except for marble heads. They must take me for an awful fool to think I'll leave anything valuable lying about in my room. Probably Izzet or one of his minions trying to find out if you've taken anything from the site. No doubt. It's more serious than you think. They won't wait much longer. Your life is in danger. Mine too! -I'm a British subject. -You're as liable as the next man to die of a knife between the ribs. Take my advice before it's too late. Let them have their papers backon the terms they've offered. And the statue? You don't understand. I have a responsibility now. But our deal. The agreement. What about that? -Is it all over, then? -Not at all. I just need a day or two longer. That's where you come in, actually. I do? - How did you find it? - Pure chance. I fell on it. Quite literally fell on it. It was fate. You know, it was the strangest feeling seeing it like that, struggling to get out. So you knew that same evening that you sent the note? Yes. That's why I mentioned the soldiers. You didn't really think they'd remove them, did you? No, but I needed to play for time. What for? So you could remove the statue from the island? make some sketches. How much more time do you need? Until the day after tomorrow. So that's what you propose? I am to ask them to wait until the day after tomorrow, then presumably you will have the contract? Exactly. Then we shall get our money. What makes you think they'll wait? They'll wait. What choice do they have? Then once we've got our money, I shall report my discovery to the authorities in Constantinople, and the statue will be recoveredand placed on exhibition in the museum there. I shall request a small plaque to be placed beside it giving my name and the circumstances of the finding. And what about me? Mahmoud Pasha will be furious. He will have no time to explore the site, officials from the mainland will be here as soon as you report the matter. True, quite true. But you will have the money, won't you, old chap? And I mean to say if Pasha had paid up and then found nothing on the site, your position would be just as difficult. You should've thought of that before you asked me to act as your interpreter. You used me. Well, never mind that now. What do you say? Shall we be allies? We two, against the whole damn lot of them? Allies. -You will go and see them, then?-Yes, I will. If you really want to help, you can come up to the site tomorrow and lend a hand. There's a lot to do,and it's slow work for just one. Really? You would like that? -I'd very much appreciate it. -What time? Any time. I'll be there all day. All right. -Good night, Pascali. -Good night, Mr. Bowles. Over the past six months, he has been performing all over Asia Minor. He has kept a faithful record. Imagine it, Excellency, the same air of righteousness, the same object, the same Gladstone bag. Now, life has ousted his art. Reality has transcended the dream. A genuine discovery. Can you wonder why he has become so passionate? So possessive? I know also why the Pasha delays. The land is no longer his. He has been buying it up as fast as he can, and now he has sold it to your government. To you, Excellency, at a handsome profit, no doubt, in view of those precious bauxite deposits. No wonder he is so afraid of the contract falling into the wrong hands. Even as a boy, I was fascinatedby the ancient world. When people asked me what I wanted to be, - I always said an archaeologist.- All my life, I've dreamt of discovering something. And now I have. It's as though everything I've ever done has led me to this. Look at him. Isn't he wonderful? He is, yes. This is not a copy. He was already old when the Romans were here. He's been here in this hillsidefor about 2,000 years. Two thousand years. He's certainly very beautiful. I think I'll go and find a bit of shade, rest for a while, if you don't mind. Time is short, you know. I was hoping you'd help me clean him up later on. Of course. If I were you, I'd get clear of the island as soon as I possibly could. As soon as you get the money, I mean. Yes. I was intending to go to Constantinople. What on earth for. That's the last place I would want to go just now. It's all over, Pascali, it's finished. -Rumors. -It's absolute fact. There's nothing for you here, either. Unless you change your profession. Or arrange a new paymaster. Why do you want to go to Constantinople anyway? I say! Stand over here. Look at him now. Yes. Yes. And you mean to say nothing has ever happened? Not once. No word of acknowledgement, not in 20 years. I get the money every month without fail. Some clod made an order on the bank and the money keeps coming. Nobody knows why, so nobody stops it. Chap who arranged it's probably dead. But that's why I want to go there, I want to find out what's happened to all my reports. It's my one chance to find some... meaning to my life. My dear fellow, have you any idea how many informants there must be in the Ottoman possessions? You really suppose those people in the ministry have a filing system? Nobody reads anything, Pascali. Your own trade is at an end, too, if what you say is true. Have you considered that? I mean, you depended on the system, didn't you? The swamp has been your habitat. - Swamp? - Yes. The Empire is a swamp, and we both belong in it, together with the orchids and the snakes. I don't know about that. In any case, I should be moving on. This is a turning point in my life. Do you realize how few original Greek bronzes there are in existence? I thought you were intending to hand him over to the authorities? Yes, I am, of course. But the mere association of my name to the discovery will be enough. Just look at his face. He's at the very end of a great,classical period. The point of decline... the brink of decadence. That's why he's so marvelous. I think I'll be getting back now, if you don't mind. Well, all right. I'll stay on a bit longer. By tomorrow, I should have all the information I need, then we can go ahead. Yes. Goodbye then, for the moment. Thank you for your help. I won't forget it. Listen. Take my advice. Don't go to Constantinople. With your languages, you could get work in Europe as an interpreter or something. -It all depends on money. -You'll get your money. You have my word on it. Five hundred lira. Tell me. What did you mean that day about the Turks? When you said you had to show them? That. Well, someone has to teach them a lesson. You know, show them the error of their ways. I see. Yes, I see. I left them together, Mr. Bowles and his bronze love. Was it possible he would give him up, leave him to the infidels? I could not believe it. I know nothing about this Mr. Bowles. Surely. He's expecting a large sum from London. Five hundred liras. He asked meto come by to inquire for him. I have received nothing. No money? -You're certain? -Nothing! How many times do I have to say it? Basil! You gave me such a fright! Please, I must talk with you. -What is it? -I have to know. I have to know what's happening. -What? -The statue. He's planning to steal it, isn't he? -What statue? -Do not pretend! What were you doing on the American's boat? He's in it, too! You're all in it together! -Have you been spying on me? -Why don't you trust me? Do I count for so little? All these years I've watched you, observed you, loved you. Lydia. Basil, don't. You love him, don't you? Your fine, upstanding Englishman? Yes, if you want to know. And you're going away with him? Answer me. It's all changing. The island, you know, it's all coming to an end. You must go, too! I have nowhere to go. I knew then, with cold certainty, what I must do. It did not take long to explain things. They knew about the statue, but it had not occurred to them that he would be mad enough to try and remove it. He begged me to return to my house and remain there. And now, the moment is at hand. The moment I have been dreading. They have come. I am to be their guide. For God's sake, be careful, Smith! Hold him steady! Don't make any sudden move, please. Off course, I can hear you. Come on, boys. No! No! No! Anthony. Lydia. Lydia, forgive me. The error... of their ways. "Here is the sum we agreed on. You must get clear of the island without delay. Be at the headland at dawn. The boat will be waiting... ...Anthony Bowles." Eight days have passed. I was right about the American. The rebels have their guns. It's over. Our empire is finished. Mr. Bowles was right about that. I knew it then as I know it now. My reports have not been read. Worse, they have not been kept. There's nothing for me now but to wait. One day soon, the Greeks will come for me. I never thought it would end this way. I never intended their death. I loved them. I loved them both. Lord of the World, Shadow of God on Earth. God bring you increase.
