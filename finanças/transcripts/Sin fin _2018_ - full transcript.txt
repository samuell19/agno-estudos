Present time / Time simulator Present time / Time simulator I didn't want to wake you up. See you later. I didn't know she was so bad. There's nothing else I can do. Hey! You can't just leave. There's nothing I can do. You have no idea what the rest of your life will be like without Maria... I brought some "churros". Sit down. Leave that. - I don't mind. - It's broken. I've told you a thousand times. It's broken. I've taken the day off today. Let's do something. What are you looking at, Javier? Why are you staring at me so much today? What are you doing here? Don't you have a lot to do? Amada, Cecilia, Elvira... you look like a Elvira. That must be your name... - If you say so... - Elvira, there's a nightclub nearby... Good music. Quality liquor. - Did he say they serve quality liquor? - That's what he said. "Estefania", they serve the lowest quality liquor. A headache all weekend. Pay no attention to my friend,"Carolina". You're coming, aren't you? - Come with us. - Come on, green eyes. Green and very beautiful eyes, Sofia. Come and have a drink. Just one. So I'm getting off the bus for just one drink? - Come on, as many as you want. - Come on. - As many as I want? Are you sure? - Of course, it's on my friend. - As many as I want? - Yes. Come on. - Do you want some? - No, thanks. Damn! Shit! - Hey, dude! What is that? - Fuck, disgusting! - Step on it! Kick it! - Look, with your toe, like Romario. Let me do it. You look like fucking Prosinecki. - He comes up to the line, he shoots and... - No, no! Goal! - Hey! What is wrong with you? - What's going on? - What are you doing? - Don't touch it, dammit! Come here, honey. Come here. Don't be afraid of these animals. - It's mine! - What? It's mine. What a nutcase, huh? Oh god, come on. Let's get off at the next stop. - Come on. - You go, I'm staying here. Hey, don't mess me around. Come on. - Leave her, she's a nutcase too. - Let's go. Won't it suffocate? The rat, in there? - It has no way to breathe. - Of course it can breathe. Look, the animal can't breathe. The backpack is completely closed. It can breathe. Wasn't that your stop? Yes. And, how do you know? Because you get off here, don't you? Well, not everyday, only on Fridays and Saturdays when you finish work at the nightclub. - What are you, a stalker? - No, we just take the same night bus. I've never seen you. Because you can't see that far. You are clearly shortsighted. A shortsighted girl is clearly the perfect victim for a rubberneck like you. I'm not a rubberneck. - Does it show? - What? - That I'm shortsighted. - Yes. Fuck. I have glasses but they make my eyes look smaller. And that's the one beautiful thing I have, my green eyes. - They're not green. - Oh, really? - They're not green. - How's that? They're not green. They're actually yellow in the center and blue toward the outside. The color changes, like a kiwi when you cut it in half. You also have tiny little dots, like in a kiwi. Five in your right eye and three in your left one. But, I mean, don't worry. Get a check-up, but it's probably just excess melanin, nothing more. - You are a rubberneck. - I am not a rubberneck. Yes, you are. Last stop, guys! You need to get off! May I...? Hello, hello! Wait, wait! What are you using there? - Creams. - Yes, but what creams? I don't know, my mom buys them for me. Tell your mom that creams won't do anything. Only seawater will heal that. The iodine has healing powers. Seriously, have you ever seen a sick fish? - You're kidding, right? - I'm serious. Everyone knows that. They either get caught or eaten by a bigger fish. Try to remember if you have a single memory of scratching a wound in the sea. I've never been in the sea. - Yeah, right. - No, I haven't. You look very much like Trigorin. Trigo... from "The Seagull" by Chekhov. I have an audition in a few days. I'm playing Nina who is madly in love with Trigo. Trigo is a writer who pays no attention to Nina. He's completely focused... on his work. He spends his days making notes in his little notebook, like you. - I'm not a writer. - What are you then? I think this is a bit unbalanced, you know? Of course it is, since you spy on me on the bus, because you are a rubberneck. I'm not a rubberneck. We just take the same bus. And since when do we take the same night bus? Come on then. What do you know about me? You are an actress: you move your lips when you read to learn your lines. And you always step onto the bus with your left foot. You've flat feet... with supination, which wears out the inner side of the soles of your shoes. Your lips are always dry, so you carry a cocoa butter lip balm in your backpack. And eucalyptus breath mints and a toothbrush. And you crack your knuckles. That's it. What happens if you don't step on the white? You fall into the void or what? You must be a Virgo. Aren't you? I'm a Pisces, I'm a dreamer, sentimental. I think you're a Virgo. Because you're an introvert, analytical. You are, right? Right? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes. - I knew it. You should know that Pisces and Virgo are opposite signs in the zodiac wheel. - Which makes us complementary. - Who says so? - The stars. - The stars don't say that. Anyway, most of the stars you can see are dead. When I was a kid I loved looking at the stars at night. Plus, where I come from, there isn't much else to do. There it's just four tiny lights. And here there are so many. It's as if every little point of light is an opportunity to live. And sometimes I worry, you know? Because it makes me feel like... I won't make the most of them all. - Just focus on one. - No, I have to live them all. I can't believe it. Such a rush for this? - But you can see this every day. - Every day? I watch the sunrise and the sunset every day. Why? Knowing that in exactly 10 seconds the first ray of light will appear, makes me feel relaxed. It will happen like that today, tomorrow... always. Five,... ... four, three,... ... two, one... ... one... ... one... It's cold, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. What is this? Your bachelor pad? But, all this? They let you have it here? Nobody comes up. My mom is the president of the residents' association. So they won't let you have it at home. - And all this junk? - It's not junk. They're cathode tubes. If I collect enough of them, I'll be able to build a particle accelerator. And what do you want one of these accelerators for? You wouldn't understand. Can you give it to me? You know what? Your eyes don't look like kiwis. But they're pretty good. - You don't miss a thing, rubberneck. - Can you give it to me? Let's see, - how many beauty spots do I have? - One on your neck. Well, that's the one you can see. Can you give it to me? - I need to... put on... - Ok, Ok. - Well, I'll see you around. - Yes, on the night bus. No, not on the night bus. I quit my job tonight. I was tired so... some other time. Are you really not going to ask me for my phone number? Yes, of course. What is it? I don't have one. I just wanted to know that you wanted it. Bye, Trigo. Give me a day. - Give me just one day. - I can't. My thesis. Your thesis tomorrow. Come on, give me one day. - Until sunset, what time is that? - At 9:09. So... until 9:09. Not a minute more, not a minute less. No. I don't know. Come on, Trigo. You only have a few more hours with her. Make the most of them. Maria... Look. "The Seagull" What if we remember that day? Let's go from one bus to another, like we did then. - So your name is Maria? - Nina. But on your travel pass it says your name is Maria. Yes. But what's in a name? Tell me, what's in a name? "That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet. Doff thy name, and for that name, which is no part of thee, take all myself." Before Nina, I played Juliet. Hey, it smells like "churros", doesn't it? Step number one. Step number two. Number three: batter. Number four. And step number five. We're not kids anymore, Javier. Really, don't insist. What is there to lose? Let's go. You kept it. "Run, Trigo!" Give me a day. Give me one day, Maria, just one day. What are you doing, Javier? Take this. Put it on. I won't leave the house. Well... then, let's stay here. Run, Trigo! Run! Where are we going? You wanted to see the sunset, didn't you? So, wherever I say. If we don't come back until tomorrow, that'll be two days. I can't afford that. - Give me your wallet! - Eh? - Your wallet. - Why? Oops! Sorry. They are always covered in fingerprints. I don't know how you can see. Thanks. What are you doing, Javier? What are you doing? This is all very strange. Very strange. You don't do this sort of thing. What's going on? What's happening? What are we doing here? I only want us to spend the day together, that's all. What for? You'll go back to the lab tomorrow. Everything will stay the same, won't it? No, no, it can't be. Has it broken? - It's the EGR valve. - The what? The valve that recirculates the exhaust gas, it's got clogged, it forms a... Good morning. I am sorry to inform you that we have broken down. - How long are we going to be stuck here? I don't know. If I were you, I would make yourselves comfortable. We can't stay here. We won't make it. Come on, let's go. Bring your notebook, Trigo. Nina! Nina, where are you going? There's nothing here. I know. I know there's nothing here. But we're not going to make it on time. Shit! It doesn't matter, the sunset is the same anywhere. Look. Shut up! Ok? What are you doing? They won't stop! - Then you do it. - No! - Why not? - Because! Give me your toothbrush. - My toothbrush? What for? - Give it to me. I am taking this. Where are you going, Trigo? Trigo! You kept that too. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Hey, you... What are you doing over there? You go on, Trigo. - Get out of there, right now! - Ok, he'll be finished soon, sir. Finished doing what? You can't touch the engine! I'm not even authorized myself! Just a moment, sir. There is no other way. Really. I can't believe this. Just a second, he's just sorting it out. - What is going on? Are you crazy? - Start it. - You can't touch the engine. - Start it, man! Start it! - What do you mean start it? - Start it. Really? Really? - Thanks so much. - What a star. How did you do it, kid? Just as well. I didn't know what I was going to do. Thanks, sweetie. Thank you! It was so hot in there! My Antonio sweats a lot. And at least we'll arrive presentable. Thank you! Sorry, man. - What? - What do you mean "what?" Can't you see what you've done? Where did you learn that? I don't know. At home. In your bachelor pad? Hey, listen, what about that accelerator you have in your bachelor pad? - What do you want it for? - It's one of the components of the quantum simulator that I'm working on. - And what is that for? - To open a temporal portal. Yes, but what for? - To travel in time. - Yeah, right. Are you serious? - Yes. - Can you travel in time? First I need to build a quantum simulator, but yes. - And what do we need to build that? - Many things. In three days I'm applying for a research grant. Are you? I'm sure you'll get it. I have a sense for these things. I mean, I'm a witch. But it's an interview and for me... I don't know... So practice, with me. Yes! Of course! Come on, I'm listening. Let's see... Morris y Thorne think... that... wormholes... More slowly. Vocalize. Calm, breathe. Let me hear it, come on. Morris y Thorne think that wormholes can stay open due to the existence of... You might kill me for what I am going to do, but wait a second. - What are you doing?! - Shut up. Hello? One, two... Can you hear me? Hi, this guy besides repairing the bus, is a total genius. He has created a theory that will revolutionize the world. Trigo! In few days' he has a presentation and he is a bit shy. - Trigo, don't let me alone. Come on. - No. Right, look at me. You tell it to me, come on. What's it about? - As you all know, Morris and Thorne... - Continue. How could you do that to me in front of all those people? ...that the universe is not only one temporal and three spatial dimensions, but rather 7 compactified dimensions, unobservable in practice. Sure. How come you didn't think I was crazy? Because maybe I was the crazy one. Two crazy people. ... I can demonstrate that exotic matter exists and that it can be used to travel faster than light and to open temporal portals. The quantum simulator that I intend to build will enable us to violate Einstein's theory of relativity. I will be able to study those particles, the effect before the cause, to score a goal before shooting. Thanks to these particles that can travel to the past, I will master space-time. I will be able to open temporal portals and use them to travel in time. You believed me about time travel from the very first moment. You seemed so harmless. I would have believed anything you said. Would you like some? - Don't eat all the "little worms", Ok? - There are other ones. Yes, that's what I mean. You can eat the little sticks, the round ones... I only like the "worms". "And we got into the car my friend, your friend you and me..." - What, you don't know it? - No. Really? What world do you live in? "You answered no..." Really? - Isn't it a bit silly? - No, it's romantic. - I don't understand it. - Yes, I know you don't understand it. Look. - I've told you I don't know them. - I know. Look. "I didn't hook up with anyone". Three, two, one, look! "These are just a couple of prudes." So? What do you think? I was supposed to play the main role but... they gave me "the friend." But it's better. I'm sure she will end up being typecast. Do you know what I've been thinking? Since you get travel sick, I'll try your machine first. I can't wait. I'm imagining, people cheering in theaters,... ... the whole city filled with posters with my face on them,... ... meeting my children... Can you imagine? "Oh oh oh oh." "I want to be with you." A "worm" and I'll give you whatever you eat. Would you like some? Suit yourself. Now I'll eat all the "worms". Come on, I want to show you something. Come with me. I can't believe it. - It's still there. - Come on. These machines are badly made on purpose. The machine is fine, but you can't just let it drop like that without thinking. Give me another coin, please. We should leave now. Hey! Shit! Do you have another coin? How was it, Maria? Let's see. It needs to be in the middle, right? - Didn't you have to get it from the center? - Yes. - Sorry, I know it bothers you. - Not anymore. Give me another coin, quick! - It's the last one. - All right. - Wait! W - Wait! - What, what, what? The hinges are very loose, avoid the sides so they don't brush against the glass. - Take the ball from the lower side. - But which one? - That one, the red one! - Ok. - This red one? - That one! - Sure? - Yes! - Wait! Let it stabilize. - Ok. Now! Now! Yes! There you are! Run! Run, Trigo! Hi! I love it! But it doesn't work. It has a mechanical movement driven by a spring. - And? - You need to remember to wind it up. Oh. I won't forget. Don't you wind it up? "I forgot my cane." "I think I left it there. Oh, it's you." "I knew we would see each other again, Trigo." "the decision is made, I am going to devote myself to the stage!" - "I will be a great actress." - No. - What do you mean "no?" - It doesn't have the "great actress" part Yes, yes. But that's my own contribution. That's always appreciated, you know? It means that I am a true actress. - Can we continue? - Yes. "I'm leaving tomorrow!" "I'll start a new life! In Moscow, like you. There, we will see each other again!" "Stay at the Slaviansky Bazaar. And let me know. I must hurry." "Just one minute." Here. You. Ok? "Oh! You are so beautiful! It makes me so happy to know that we will" "soon see each other again! That I will see those wonderful..." "green eyes again..." "That tender smile..." "... those sweet features and that expression of angelic purity. My love." - Here it says "kiss." - Yes, yes. It wouldn't be that easy for you. You had to earn it. Hey, why did you let me sleep so long? What's going on? Is anything wrong? Oh, wow, what a way to make the most of a bit of paper. This pen and the little cord, did you invent it? Where? On a bench or what? Can you please stop doing that? Oh, sorry, that's my only odd habit. Better not analyze yours... Are you going to read it all or what? You should know that Trigo doesn't end up with Nina. He leaves her for his work and Nina fails as an actress. She also loses a child. Don't you think that love... can last forever? No, 18 months at most. That's how long the secretion of dopamine and phenethylamine lasts in the brain. After that it's no longer love, it's attachment. - So says the expert on the subject. - You shouldn't have asked. - Love is hormonal self-suggestion. - Wait until you're in love. Nothing more. Don't you want to fall in love? I don't want to waste my time. You know what? I feel sorry for you. You're an actress? Really? Where might I have seen you? In a soap-opera? Or in a series? I watch them all. I am totally hooked on one called "Captives of Love." She's an orphaned peasant who falls in love with the pirate who kidnaps her. And in the end, it turns out that they are half-siblings. It's Ok, I like it, but it's not like they used to be. "Topaz", "The Lady in Pink"... those were truly romantic stories. You imagined other people's lives... What is your boyfriend having? And do they straighten your hair when you do things? No. And what about learning your lines? You must have to study a lot. That's why your eyesight is worn out, right? Yes. - Would you excuse me a moment? I need to look for my... - We'll talk later. - All right. - She is an actress. - Is she? - Have you seen her in anything? - Actually, no. - Her face does seems familiar. - Maybe she's an extra. - I thought you'd gone. - I cannot figure out how. I don't know. Putting together a couple pieces of junk and making yourself a bike. Like MacGyver. You could do it. I didn't try to commit suicide or anything like that. But I was very young when my parents died. And I was left on my own. I found myself alone so... so suddenly that... Fuck, a little girl as I was, all she wants is to feel secure in the world. I always knew that my father was going to die. He had a degenerative disease. It was a matter of time. One day he asked me to go up to the roof to fix an antenna. I was busy with my own things. He always understood me. He was the only one. In the end he went up himself. It's stopped. You should wind it up. And go up to fix the antenna. W They're covered in fingerprints. They're crooked. - If you give me a minute, I can fix them. - Don't worry. Today I just need to look at things close up. What did you see in me? I don't know. I probably thought that you were one of those good guys... that would make life easier... for a girl like me. Just like you fixed the bus you could fix me too. But, I mean, in the end... you didn't turn out to be that good, nor did I have green eyes. Nor anything, for that matter. "A rose sprout like a love..." Look. "... spontaneously and sincerely, lovely and flamenca..." Eyes green like the sea. That's what I thought but they aren't, are they? "My love's eyes are green as the sea, eyes like a flower kissing as they look" Come on. Don't fall into the void. ".... Your hair, Amparo,..." "... is black as coal..." "... Your lips red as poppies, lovely lips they are..." "Orange trees sprouting from the ground to the blue sky full of grace and primrose" There it is, Trigo. "My love's eyes green as the sea, eyes like a flower kissing as they look" You are at least writing on a blank page, right? Yes. "Your lips red as poppies, lovely lips they are". "In my arms, beautiful girl from Valencia, together we shall enjoy a happy life" "My love's eyes green as the sea, eyes like a flower kissing as they look" "Your hair, Amparo, is black as coal. Your lips red as poppies, lovely lips they are." What are you doing? We only have enough for one ticket! - Leave it to me. Hi. - Your ticket? - Er... I don't have one, sir. - It's 400 pesetas. For the sake of 400 pesetas you won't let me travel? - I am sorry, girl. No money, no ticket. - It's for a good purpose. I don't get it. Hadn't we already got to the sea? Yes. But it's not here. Last call for line 5 to Conil. Bay number 3. Excuse me, madam, may I borrow 400 pesetas? Excuse me, could you lend me 400 pesetas? Otherwise I'm stuck here. OK, no big deal. The sea is the same anywhere. Look, don't start, again, Ok? - What do we do now? - Where did you want to take me? To a beach right next to Conil. I used to go when I was young. From there you can see the best sunsets in the world. You would have loved it, honestly. Come, come with me. Excuse me! Are you going to Conil by any chance? - No, sorry. - No, but it is on our way. Mari Carmen, in grandpa's car there isn't enough room for us all... - Sorry, guys. - There is room, Dad. Right, Grandpa? It's it your car. Say they can come. - Come on then, let's go. - Great! - Thanks, Grandpa! - Come on! Ok, come on! Fun times! We're all going! Are you Ok? I can't get in the car, sorry. It's making me panic. But we've spent all day going from one bus to another! Yes, but I have a fear of... of cars, not of buses. That doesn't make sense. I haven't got into a car since I was 7 years old. Sorry, but I can't. No. - Yes, you can. - No. I can't. Of course you can. Hey! You two! We're leaving! Trust me. Everything will be fine. - I'll come back soon. Just a minute. - I'll come with you. No, it's just a second. Don't worry. "Come back soon. It's nearly 9:09". "What do you want?" "Seriously, Maria, what do you want? I am very busy right now." Who are you talking to? "Who are you talking to?" "Who are you talking to?" "What was that noise? Maria!" "Is anything wrong? Maria, are you there?" Are you Ok? Maria! Maria! When will I do it? At sunset, right? Drop it. Do I slit my wrists? Throw myself off a balcony? I don't know, I've imagined it in so many ways. Why did you come back, Javier? To save me? You won't remember, because you don't remember these things. But one day I turned up unexpectedly at the lab. A surprise. I wanted to show you my support, because I have always believed in you. But your face, Javier... You were so annoyed. It was just a second, enough to realize that you don't need anyone at your side. This is me two days ago. He loves you, but you are not the most important thing in his life. You probably never have been. Maria, I want to apologize... for not following you in your dreams, for not hugging you, for not looking at you... for not being there. I was never there for you, for anyone. Forgive me. I don't know. But that's two days ago. now I only want you to be happy. For us to enjoy the time we have together. For us to see our sunset. Let's go. Come. So it works. You finally did it. I didn't achieve anything. No. It's you. I imagined you differently. I don't know. But I do recognize you. I recognize you. What did you do all these years? Did you meet someone? - I left you alone, didn't I? - Just as I did to you. Are you all right? You two look so in love. You remind me of my Antonio and me when we were young. Believe it or not, he played the saxophone in an orchestra. When I saw him up there in those tight jeans, that sequined shirt, that hair gel... playing saxophone with such energy. I told myself, "those lungs need to be mine." And they have been up to this day. Are you still in love? Yes, right? Yes, right? You left only the "little worms". And now that your machine is working, where will you go? You can't just go wherever you want. It doesn't work that way. Then, how does it work? He gave it to me last night. Well, tomorrow night. He brought it from the future. - But it's still stopped. - You never wound it up. So it only takes you to the time when it stopped. I don't even get it myself. I never dealt with the emotional dimension of things. - I know. - Yeah. Listen. It smells like the sea. I'm sure that when we get to the shore, you'll be healed. I told you: water has healing power. Come on let's go. Let's go. Come on, run! Come on! Trigo, we've arrived! Run! Come on! Go in. It won't hurt you! Take off your shoes, won't you? Take off your shoes! You can't be on a beach with your shoes on. Trigo! Wake up, Trigo. What's up? - Are you sleeping? - I'm not. It feels so good to know that after one wave breaks, another one will follow, - and then another. - and then another. And so on, forever. All I see is a green mass. It's not green. The sea too? It's an illusion. It's an illusion. And now... what? Now you just need to wind it up and your life will be the way you always wanted it. That is all I want. Why don't we stay here? Now, forever. I can already see you as an old lady, walking barefoot along the shore. - With you. - Or without me. With you. Well, here we are. Here is your sunset. I'm leaving. I'm leaving? I'm leaving. Hey! I forgot. "Run, Trigo!" Run. "Run, Trigo!" Run! Wind it up. Where have you been? - With you. - I've been calling you. - I know. - I was worried. I'd better leave. I've got so much to do and now my schedule is in disarray. See you later, eh? I'm very happy to see you like this. What's up? Nothing. - I'm going to work. - I know. What are you doing? I'm leaving. I can give you a ride, if you want. No. I'm really leaving, Javier. Come back for me. THE END NOT THE END
