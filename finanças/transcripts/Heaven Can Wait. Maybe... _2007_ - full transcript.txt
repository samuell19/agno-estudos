We grew up in this neighborhood, Tsukiji. Me, Kaoru and Takeshi, we were together all the time. They mean more to me than I do to myself. I believed everything would stay as it was. Without a doubt, no matter what. "Tsukiji Fish Market" "The Asahi Newspaper" Nishioka, make some room for this exclusive. Thank you. "News Department" I see... your friend is in the hospital. Hope he's back on his feet soon. It's sweet pea season... already. Hello there. This is the third year, isn't it? I'll take these. Sure. Hi there. Back again. Doctor! Hello, you two. How is Takeshi doing? Good you came. Come in. We're back. Welcome back. Back again. Dad, you came too? She twisted my arm. Hey! I asked you because you're always waiting to be invited. That's right. Your father was always shy, that hasn't changed. What's that? So how is Takeshi doing? Oh... Well... The cherry buds will blossom pretty soon. Cherry blossom party season... This will be the third year. Why don't we all have a cherry blossom party again? Here. Let's have a good time again. The nurses would LOVE that. It will be so embarrassing. So embarrassing. Don't be like that. Takeshi loves a good party. That's right. What does the doctor say? Nothing. Nothing... Takeshi will pull through. He will. Hiroki, how is work? Everything's ok. My new job is actually pretty important. You may not know much about the layout department. We decide where to place everything in the paper. I see. Kind of a battle in a way. Wow... You are in a battle, huh? What do you mean by that? Kaoru... You tired? I'm going to get us some coffee. Okay. Thanks. We're a sacred triangle. We three will always be together. "North Tsukiji Elementary School" "Hiroki" Introduce yourself to the class. "Hiroki Nishioka" Mr. Nishioka? Mr. Nishioka? Something wrong? Well... Go on. "Takeshi Ueno" Nice to meet you. "Kaoru Nakano" Nice to meet you. Hey, you guys... He's not going to remember after one time. Come this way! Hey Takeshi! - Hi, Kaoru! - I'm back. "FUCHO" - Back again. - Welcome back. - Takeshi, take Minako too. - Okay. Hi, Kaoru. I got a bit drunk last night. Do you think Haru was angry? - Mom was angry at you. - Oh, my. Yo! Well, how do you do? What are you doing? Hiroki, let's go. Take care of Minako. "Cafe HARU" Thank you. Well, then you don't have a mom? Just Dad. Mom died. I have neither. So I stay at my uncle's. I've only got my Dad. I have both. Hey, is there a problem that you have both? My dad grew up in this neighborhood. Really? What's his name? Tadao Nishioka. Mom, do you know him? Do I know him? Your father had a big crush on me. Have dinner here. Your dad's working, right? You can come everyday, ok? What? Why don't you? One digit here and also one digit there, then you can calculate it as usual. You'll get 235. She's Haru's daughter and he's Kosuke's nephew. So did you get it? I got it. I didn't but I tried. That's good enough. What is that? Same as your uncle. "Hiroki Nishioka, 97" ' "Hiroki Nishioka, 97" Miss Kaoru Nakano. "Hiroki Nishioka, 97" ' Here. Great job. "Kaoru Nakano, 85" Mr. Takeshi Ueno. Wow, I've got 17! My first with double digits! Say something. Hey! Can't you talk? What are you doing to Hiroki? You, wait! Are you okay? Stop that! What did you say? Leave Kaoru alone! Who do you think you are? - Leave Kaoru alone! - Let me go! Get off. Get off. Go away. The three of us will always stay together like a triangle. More than a perfect triangle, a sacred triangle. A sacred triangle? You mean we're gonna stay like this even when we're grown-ups? You got it. I like that idea. What kind of job do you wanna get? How about you? I think I'm gonna work here. I like this market. I see. What about you? I'm gonna work over there. Really? That's cool. Really? That's cool. My Dad dreamed of becoming a journalist. I want to realize my father's dream. Wow. You're cool, Hiroki. We'll be working close. That's nice. How about you? Takeshi at this market and Hiroki at that building. then to make it a triangle... That's Ginza! I'll work in Ginza. A Ginza evening lady? What? "FUCHO" Quickly, the tuna will melt! Hey, Takeshi. Yeah. - Let's cut this tuna. - Sure! Don't hold it like that. You'll lose a good part. A real fishmonger, eh? - Your lunch. - Thanks, Minako. Minako, sometimes you should help out here. Absolutely no way! I'm going. Have a good day. What are you smiling at? "News Department" ' ' "News Department" Nishioka, where's the data? "News Department" ' ' "News Department" Coming. ' Nishioka, let's go! "Ginza, Tokyo" Excuse me. Ms. Nakano. The president liked your idea for the new merchandise. - Did he really? - Good job. Keep it up. Yes, ma'am. Take it easy. See you tomorrow. "The Asahi Newspaper" Well then, let's do that first. So, we should get there first. - We can come back later to finish it. - That'll be okay. Thank you. - Minako, welcome back. - Hi, Dad. Hi, I'm back. Hi. Have some omelette rice? Yes, I'd love to. Takeshi, what's wrong? Sighing is not your thing. Exactly. Well, l... What? Is it about your job? The pay is too low or your boss too nearsighted? - How can you say such...? - I like my job. See? I knew you liked it. You hush up, now. But my working hours are so different from Hiroki and Kaoru's. I start work at 2 AM, you know? So I have to turn in really early. They both have regular daytime jobs so it's hard to meet. Wanna be with the other two, right? I'd like to get off here. Kaoru! - Hiroki! Going home? - Yeah, you too? What? First time to run into you after work in Ginza. Yeah. That's right. As promised, I joined the Ginza ladies. Yeah, you did. Aren't you hungry? Do you wanna grab a bite? Yeah... I want Haru's omelette rice. Too much eating out these days. I think our cafe would be "eating out." What? I guess so... but Cafe HARU is like home cooking for me. Then let's go over there. Mom would love to see you. Let's. Oh, do you think Takeshi would...? Must be sleeping. Thought so. Hello. I'm home. Why are you two together? He wanted to see you so he didn't go to sleep. He was like a kid at New Year's Eve. Auntie. Long time no see! I came for your omelette rice. I'm so happy. - No way. - What? - Let's go somewhere. - Now? Now! I wanna enjoy the Tokyo nightlife too. Wait, I wanna have omelette rice. Shut up and come. Auntie, I'll be back. Okay. You're going with them. See you later. Welcome. Do I smell like fish? I think you're okay. Let's get a table. Enjoy your meal. Looks delicious. Let me try some mussels. Ms. Nakano. May I? - Thoughts about the layout? - I've got several designs... Sorry to be late. Well... I wanted all of us for this. Hiroki... I'm going to propose Kaoru now. What? Is that okay? Is that okay with you? Well, l... Okay or what? Well... What are you talking about? Kaoru! Yes? Will you marry me? I want you to be my wife. Stay with me forever. I'm not a clever man but I'll love and cherish you until the day I die. I'll work hard and never look at another woman, I swear. I promise that I will make you happy. If you'll let me... That's great. That's the best. You two make a nice couple. Do you mean it? Do you really think so? Yeah. Isn't it, Kaoru? What? I suppose so... Wow! You finally showed up. Yo! You're late. Sorry. I didn't expect this. What is it about? Never mind. Where's Takeshi? Working. Working today? Why today of all days did he have to work? Yeah, I wonder too. It's not my fault! One of our clients needed a delivery today. I told him he didn't have to. But he insisted. He said he had some other errands to run. So, you and I are going to be family soon. So what? I haven't received the dowry yet. You have to do it. Make it a big one. Congratulations. Thank you. Looks great. Sho, good job. What is he doing? Not answering at all. Hello. What? What's that? - As I told... - What? What do you mean? He might never wake up? What does that really mean? How can I believe such a crazy thing? Dad. Forgive us. I promise we'll do our best, but it is possible that he will remain in a coma. There's nothing else, I can say at this point. But he is alive. Please don't forget that. He's alive. Takeshi... He's going to stay like this. Like this... He may not be able to wake up again. No way. I can't believe it. That's not true Why don't you wake up? Please wake up. Takeshi... Takeshi... Takeshi... This is strange. Seeing you two everyday, seems like old times. You're right. Kaoru. Are you alright? He'll wake up. Definitely. I'm sure he will. I know that for sure. What do you mean you want to transfer? Sorry but I need to have a regular schedule right now. I'm begging you. I understand about your friend but do you really want desk work? Are you really sure? I'm sure. I'd appreciate it, sir. "Layout Department" Hey, Yamamura. What's up? A big news? We've got an exclusive! Here, your lunch. Come in and join us. Dad! You're drinking too much. Who wouldn't drink at a cherry blossom party? I had that dream again Felt the breeze The melody repeating over and over Who is it being played for? Over the tables, the shadows dance The sun shines softly through the leaves The room is completely bathed in the light And again I close my eyes I wait for you I'll always be here for you I wait for you In modest light I wait for you I'll always be here for you I wait for you In modest light... The melody repeating over and over Who is it being played for? Merry Christmas. "Inari Shrine" It's been three years. Hey, Haru... What? It's about Kaoru. Is it okay for her like this? What do you think, Haru? There's nothing we can do for our children... except to support them in their decisions. That's all. But doesn't Kaoru... Takeshi's not the one she loves. - She loves Hiroki, right? - What? Haru! Things are not that easy. I'm sure you guys haven't a single clue about women. Welcome. What's the matter? Yo! Why don't you do something for Kaoru? What? Do something. You are the one to make her happy. I believe so. And Takeshi... He thinks so too. I'm sure he does. Do you like it? This is nice. You have to get this. But isn't this too bright? Not at all. You should wear something cheerful. Yes! This is the one. What a good eye I've got. Kaoru, you have to make yourself happy. Make myself happy... What? I don't know what happiness is. No one else but you can know what your happiness is. But no matter what I'll always be there for you. Always... No matter what you choose... You got it? Got it. Didn't I just say something good? I'm home. Welcome home. Minako, you were here. Welcome back. Thank you. Well... What? I... since we were kids, I thought... that you were... you were in love with Hiroki. Am I wrong? What are you saying? I think it's enough. About Takeshi, it's enough, I think. You've done enough. How could it be enough? You know... How could it be enough? I'm going to the hospital. Kaoru? You have to... You have to be happy. Will you... Will you let me make you happy? I want to make you happy. Will you marry me? Until Takeshi wakes up... Be my wife, 'til then. Welcome home. Hi, Mom. Get some rest. Good night. So, Haru and I will be family. Hiroki confessed his feelings not like his father. Don't take that the wrong way. A strange relationship. Something wrong? If you can't celebrate then you'll lose your jobs. That's ridiculous. Hey, hey, let's celebrate! Okay? It's too quiet like being at a hospital. We are at the hospital. Yeah, but that's okay. Thank you. Shall we toast? Bro...? Bro? Takeshi? Takeshi! Doctor... Doctor! Go get the doctor now! Takeshi? Excuse me. Mr. Ueno. Mr. Takeshi Ueno. Can you hear my voice? If you can hear me, blink once. One more time. If you can hear me, blink slowly. It is a miracle, what else could it be? Sorry, this might not be proper for a doctor to say. I am very surprised. Never underestimate Tsukiji men! Takeshi was born and raised in Tsukiji. Takeshi's a lot stronger than average guys. But there are still some hurdles for him. What? What do you mean? He doesn't remember the accident. And his memory of events around that time is very hazy. What's that? It may take time but he might recover the missing memories. For now he needs to work on getting his strength back. Do it slowly and not too much at once. So you don't remember? No... I'm not sure. Three years... Hope I can get up soon. I can't move my own body at all. So he doesn't remember... at all... Here is fine. Oh... Okay. Are we... What? Never mind. See you then. What's going to happen to us? Push. Use your knees. He's doing a great job. In a month, he's regained most of his strength. Usually it takes at least three months just to get up. Because Takeshi is a Tsukiji man. He's got plenty of guts! Okay then... Put a green one over here. Yo! What's this? What? Well... Haru... What? Tell me. What's going on? Well... Haru, please... There you are. That's okay. Why don't you tell him? Don't stare at me like that. Well then, I'm leaving. Wow, Haru, what? This is your job, isn't it? Takeshi, see you at the cafe soon. Bye. Yo. Hey, you lush. You can't hold your liquor. The apple doesn't fall far. Naught to do but drink? Grab a drink with me? What? Then let's get drunk. What the hell is this? Then next... over here. Then here. There. Takeshi? I can't do this today. I'm done. Something wrong? No... I just don't feel doing this. I see... I'm going to bed. I'm a little tired. Are you? Yeah. Takeshi... No... He's got less than a month? I'm so sorry. He might... I think Takeshi... he might have come back because he wanted that so badly. What? Sorry. It didn't sound like a doctor talking. Uncle. What did he say? Well... he just got tired. It was too sudden and too much for him. This is the way you get well you go through this cycle. So this is a good sign. I see. That's good then. I'll stay here so you two can go to work. I've got the morning off today. I see. Kaoru, don't worry. Okay. But I'll be back soon. See you later. Hiroki, can we...? His condition suddenly got worse. There's nothing they can do. Okay, listen... Why don't we... act normally in front of him. That's about all we can do. Okay? That's best. Did I wake you? Well, Hiroki... How long have I got? What did you say? You just came back. Remember? I'm serious. Hiroki... I'm serious. Somehow, I already know. Takeshi... Please tell me. Please. A month. About that. Let this be our secret. Don't let on that I know. That's everybody, including Kaoru. I see... A month... Takeshi! Takeshi, you're better! Wow, Takeshi! Welcome back. Takeshi, welcome back! Ms. Nakano, this is for you. Thank you. Hello. Nakano speaking. "Pay Phone" Hello. Takeshi. Hiroki... You must make Kaoru happy. Kaoru... You've been in love with Hiroki for a long time... since we were little. I know that 'cause I love you. Good! That's all I wanted to say! I'm sorry, Kaoru. I'm so sorry. Why...? You don't have to apologize. Nobody has to apologize. Here's a page proof. Will you check it? Sure I will. I'm back. Welcome. Welcome back. Back again. You're early. You beat me today. Well, Kaoru... Hiroki... Do me a favor. Will you, please? No. Just do it! What? I want to see the wedding. Your wedding. Welcome. Yo. I've been wanting this. Tastes great. Is it time? Yeah, I guess. Will you? Well then... here they are. You look beautiful. You are so beautiful. This is what made me fall for you. How can you talk like that to the bride? I can, of course. I'm special. We're special. Hiroki... Kaoru... We are going to... take our vows in front of the people we love. take our vows in front of the people we love. In this big world, In this big world, as my partner for life, as my partner for life, we've chosen each other. we've chosen each other. We feel so fortunate. We feel so fortunate.

Haru, shouldn't we start looking for a kindergarten? Way too early. Quickly, the tuna will melt! Okay! I hope this one thing will never change How great it could be to have it I know one day we will meet again Even if we are parted and far away Spring breezes bring the season of cherry blossoms Smiling, crying, and thinking of you So tender, so sad, so fragile Falling stars from the blue sky So many sweet memories still live inside of me
