- Do you mind if I steal one? - No go ahead, have one. - Thanks. - Hey! - Oh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Sure you are. - Hey, I wasn't the one who-- - Who was watching where he was going? - Oh well, that's me. A regular one-man roadblock. - Oh, you think you're going to charm your way out of this? - This? What? Misdemeanour sidewalk blocking? Felony produce endangerment? Are you making a citizen's arrest here? - You're no farmer, are you? - I could be. - I don't think so. Silk shirt, Italian jeans, Rolex. - Well, there's good money in peaches you know. - How'd you like to get out of those clothes, mister peach farmer? - My wife might have something to say about that. - So might my husband. Whoo! [ Laughter ] - So, what does my wife have to say? - About your way with words? - No, about my boyish charm. - Charming defenseless women in the street? - Ha-ha. Hey! It's just... It's just a phase, it'll pass. - Not if I've got anything to do with it, it won't. [ Cell phone rings ] - Oh! - Don't you answer that. - I've got to! - No, no! - I have got to. - You are not indispensable. - Come on. - You're not indispensable. Not to them. - Luckily they have not figured that out yet. Hey Nabil. Oh, not much. Just meeting with a very important client. - [Whispering]: Very important. - No, I won't be back in the office today. I will tell you about it tonight at the party. Nabil, just relax, okay? We've been through this. I... yeah, well just trust me. I've got us covered. I will, tonight. Yeah, I'll see you then. Hmmph! It looks like I am indispensable. - You've been so stressed lately. - That's why I get paid the big bucks, don't you know. - Could we just go away somewhere, just the two of us, away from all the office politics and pressure, and never come back? Please! Please, please, please, please! - How would I support you in the manner to which you have become accustomed? - We could support each other. - Uh-huh. - We could open our own little B & B. - Uh-huh. - Roll up our sleeves, get our hands all dirty and spend a little time together. - That's what we're doing. - You know what I mean. - Nope. I want to give you everything. - I've got everything. - Uh-uh. I want to make you proud. - Oh ho! I am proud. - Really proud. - I am really proud. [Whispering]: I love you. Oh, we're going to be late. - We can't be late. It's our own party. - You tell that to the caterers. - Perfect. - Chandra! Nabil! Glad you could make it. - Hi! - Hey. - Diane. - Nabil. - So, what do you think. Diane did an amazing job or what? - Very nice. - Thank you. - So, our major distributor goes belly up and my CFO decides to have a party. - Charity fundraiser. Besides, I already told you, I got us covered. Our reserve fund is parked in a-- - High yield, low risk, short term-- - Investment. - Yeah. - It's totally liquid. - Thanks. So, how come the half million dollars didn't show up in the corporate account this morning, or yesterday, or the day before? - It'll be there tonight. - Tonight? - Uh-huh. - Who does business at 8pm on a Friday? - I swear it. - That's Rand's boss. Chandra's his wife. All these big financial types. I cannot believe they all came. - Vulture capitalists. Anything for charity and an open bar. - Oh my, God. Hey, how are you? - Relax, kiddo. You did good. - Really? For the new kid on the block. - For any kid on any block. Great food, great music, cute waiters. - Shh! - You've got a great eye, Diane. Finding the good ones early is a real gift. - Uh-hmm. - Excuse me ladies. - I can see why you and Rand haven't gotten around to having kids. - [Diane]: Oh, we're working on it. - And who can blame you. - [Speaking softly]: If I thought for a second this deal would jeopardize our friendship. I never would have-- - Come on. So, can you get me out? - It's a short term investment, Rand, but it's not that short. - I thought you said you could get it. - I said I'd try. - Oh! I've got to get this money back on the company books. When you didn't call me back, I had to tell my boss. You know, my ass is really on the line here, Mitchell. Come on. - You got the running instructions? - Yeah. Do you got someone to buy me out? - No, but I can't leave you hanging out like this. I'm going to cover you out of my operating account until I find another investor. - I so owe you. - Hey, a guaranteed 100% return. How hard could it be? The funds will go through now, they'll be waiting there when the bank opens on Monday. - Thank you. Bye, Glen. - Feeling better? - Yeah, I am better. - Hmm. - I am better than better. - Hmm. Who was that man you were talking to before? - So. - Mission accomplished. - Really? Show me. - Well, everything's under control, so, trust me. - Show me. - Hey, you're the boss. - We'll be right back. - No people skills. Even in college. Back in a flash. - Thank you. - I don't see it buddy. - It's got to be here, okay. - It's kind of hard to miss a half million dollar electronic deposit. - Well, I watched him make it myself. He said when the bank opens on Monday it would be there. - Monday? Two days from now? - Yeah. - You're kidding, right? - Rand? Honey? - Mitchell Thompson, he's about my age, dark hair. He was driving a Silver Lexus convertible. Do you know where he is? - Oh yeah, yeah. He was parked over there, but he's long gone. - Where, where?! There?! - Yeah, right there. - Honey, talk to me. - He's gone. He's gone. - Who? - Mitchell. The transfer was not a mistake. It was... He was giving himself a head start. The weekend. - What are you talking about? - Oh, God. - Rand? - He called for months with no charge stock... no charge stock tips. Never once tried to push anything on me. Infallible. Checked him out with his other clients. His rate of return on investment was... it was amazing. I trusted him. You know, he was... he was my friend. - I don't understand, Rand. - He had a once in a lifetime deal. I invested a million dollars. - Do we even have that kind of money? Rand? [ Slam ] - No, I leveraged everything I... took a second on the house, our savings and my 401K, it was only $500,000. So I just borrowed the rest from the company reserve fund. - You borrowed? - Oh, it was just sitting there in short terms CD's, earning next to nothing. A couple of months I could have put it all back with interest. No harm, no felony. We would have been set, so freaking set! - But why? - Diane, we're drowning. - Rand, this house, the cars, your job. We're not drowning, Rand. - You play in the bigs, you know, you gotta look the part. Oh yeah, sure, Nabil, he pays himself huge. The rest of us? This was my chance. This was our chance. - Why didn't you tell me? Huh? Rand? - I wanted you planning parties, raising our kids, buying art. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [ Quiet sobbing ] - Nabil is your friend. He's your friend. You were college buddies. - No. - Rand, you borrowed the money. It's going to be okay. You borrowed it. - The state opposes bail in this case your honour. Given the hundreds of thousands of dollars involved, the defendant is a serious flight risk. - Your honour, my client is a victim here, like dozens of others who were taken in by Mitchell Thompson's fraudulent investment schemes. As the court is aware, Mr. Thompson has disappeared along with millions of dollars, but Randall Ackers is here before you today, taking full responsibility for his actions. He's lost five-hundred thousand dollars of his own money. He's cooperating fully with the district attorney and has already signed over the deed to his home as partial restitution. Your honour, I can assure you my client isn't going anywhere. He can't afford to. - Bail is set for $150,000. [ Gavel ] - The rug goes in the rental, and the big screen TV and all the other furniture goes to the consignment house. Be very careful. [ Sigh ] We're going to get through this. It's only furniture. - Yeah. I'm going to go do a quick walk through. - Rand. We will get through this. Hmm? - Yeah. - Oh! - Oh, I'll take that. Thanks. [ Gunshot ] Rand?! - I know you, Diane. You're not a quitter. - Laura, the Art gallery was pretty much my last hope. I guess it's time my folks found out that their only daughter's an instant widow. Broke, and apparently with no marketable skills. - You haven't told them about Rand? - I didn't have the heart to tell them on the phone. I thought it was better to tell them in person. - Are you sure this thing will make it California? - It's got to. - Please, take it. - Oh, Laura. You're a true friend. Thank you. I will call you if I need anything. - You're a survivor, you know that? - Well, I hope so. - Your card, they declined the charge. Parts and labour $872.46. Did you want to call them? - No. Do you take cheques? - No. - Okay, just give me a sec. Mom? Hey. It's good to hear your voice too. How's dad? Oh God, really? Will you tell him my fingers are crossed for him? Yeah. No, oh no, nothing. I just... well, nothing that can't wait. I... I just called to say I'll see you soon. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Love you. Bye. Bye. Are you sure you can't take a cheque. - Would you? - Whatever happened to that friendly West Texas attitude? - The interstate, Enron, Jerry Springer. - We can't work something out? - Pay what you owe and you're on your way. It's as simple as that. - And if I can't? - The car just sits there. - Unless you can find it in your heart to trust somebody other than God for a week or so until I get the money to pay for you parts and labour. I swear, I won't leave town until you've got every cent. Please. I swear. - Don't you make me sorry. - Thank you. Thanks. - Hard to find good help these days, especially when you need it. Cerise, this here is Dee Dee Martin. Show her the ropes, okay? Break her in easy please. - Hi. [ Cerise giggles ] What? What's the matter? - First thing, get yourself out of that fancy footwear and into some real shoes. - Ah! These are real shoes. - All right. Second thing, just because I'm wearing a name tag, don't make me stupid. Eight hours hustling tables in those toe jammers and you'll be crippled for life, and no way I'm working this whole room my own self because you fast talked old "mush-for-brains" into thinking that you'd ever seen the back side of a restaurant in your whole please-and-thank-you life. - Cerise. I really need this job, just for a while. So, if you could just please... that'd be great. - Carry your own weight, I got no cause. - I'm a quick study, you'll see. - All right, all right. Just save the sorority girl stuff for the customers. First break, hustle your butt on down to the store, get yourself some sneakers with the thickest soles you can find. - Sorry. Oh! Pasta, pizza. Pizza, pasta, sorry. Tea. That's right. Okay. [ Humming ] [ Sigh ] - Good morning, Dee Dee. - Deputy. - Fernando. Everybody around here calls me Nando. - Are you one of Cerise's regulars? - Yeah, you know, I was feeling a little bit adventurous today. - Oh, looking for something new and different. Well, I guess you'll need one of these. *** [ Whistling ] Thanks. I always thought Cerise was the name of a colour. - Is there a reason a colour can't be somebody's name? - No, of course not. - What kind of cutesy, college girl name is Dee Dee anyhow? - Well, they didn't have a Diane in that drawer. - He wouldn't shell out for a new nametag? - I guess he wasn't sure I'd be worth the investment. - Cheap bastard. Right, left and up from the bottom. Anyways, it's cherry red with a little burnt orange to kick it up a notch. - Excuse me, what? - Cerise. The colour of the sun just before it sets. My momma's favourite time of day. We'd just... ...just stop whatever we was doing and just watch. "That's you, Cerise." "A blaze of summer glory." Anyway, my summer glory just turned 10 last month, it's all I can do to keep her in clean socks and out of trouble. - Whoa, this can't be right. - FICA, withholding, group medical. Where you been girl? - And we're supposed to live on what's left? - Unless you got an offshore tax shelter somewhere. See, used to be you could live of your hourly bank of tips, but now Uncle Sam takes a piece of that too. - But I've got car repairs. - And I got a daughter who needs a laptop for school. - How do you do it? - Creativity. Double coops. - There you go darling. Enjoy. Yesterday's special. Just because the Board of Health won't let us serve leftovers don't mean they got to go to waste. - Deputy. - Nando. When are you going to start calling me Nando like everybody else does? - Kind of late to be giving out parking tickets, Nando. - I just want to make sure everybody gets home safe, if that's okay with you. - Since this is such a high crime area. - Listen, new in town does not mean that a person is not entitled to full protection under the law. - New in town's just passing through. - You know, you stand back far enough, we're all just passing through, Dee Dee. Look, let me get that for you. You know we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot the other day, and I was just hoping if... maybe we could have a fresh start? - You should know that I'm newly single and I plan to stay that way. - Okay, fair enough. But if you change your mind, I mean about me seeing you home sometime. - I'll keep that in mind. Can I go? [ She starts up the car ] - Oh hey there. I was about to think that maybe you'd gone and left town on us. - We made a deal. - Oh, it wouldn't be the first time. - It's not much, but I'll be back next week. - It all adds up. Thank you. - Your beef, sir, and your barbeque Miss Seagle, with extra sauce, the way you like it. - Ha-ha. You know the leading cause of death my friend? Getting out of bed in the morning. Sign right over there. Thank you very much. Oh, that's my pen. Thanks. - Hello? You need to send a cop to "The Cash Cow" immediately. Yes, it's an emergency. No, no, no. It's immediate... No, no, the man who killed my husband is sitting in the restaurant... No, he didn't exactly... Could you just... just send someone. - Are you sure it was even him? You said that you never even met the men, just saw him once at a party. How long ago was that? - Sir, my husband is dead because of him. I know what he looks like. - I'm sorry for your loss, m'am, but Midland County's got enough on its plate without trying to clean up after some jurisdiction halfway across country. Now, if there was an outstanding warrant... - He disappeared before we could file charges against him. As I said before, his name may not even be Mitchell Thompson, but he's here. There must be something you can do. - Our hands are pretty much tied. Without a name, there's really nothing we can do. If we were talking Enron here, sure. But we're not. [ Sigh ] [ Clunk ] - Your iced tea. - Perfect, thank you darling. - Had a chance to look at your-- - Menu? What's good today. - Well, we're famous for our ribs. It brings in the City Hall crowd. - Well, ribs it is. - Top it off with a slice of our homemade apple pie. A scoop of French vanilla? - You working on commission, Dee Dee... - Martin. Dee Dee Martin. - Dee Dee Martin from Casey, Mo. Your customers must all be the size of Volkswagens. - Wholesome food and friendly service. We leave the calorie counting to Richard Simmons. - Well, if you ever need bean counting, I'm your guy. Mark Taylor, estate planning, asset management. I make money for people. Usually a lot of money. - Mark Taylor. Well you need to, just to afford these. - I'm a certified investment counsellor. Do you know anybody in the market? - And I'll be passing this along out of the goodness of my heart? - Referral fee. The goodness of my heart. - Ah, the profit motive. - What made this country great. - And here I thought it was honesty, hard work, fair play. - That too. You don't sound like you're from around here. - Neither do you. - New in town. I'll tell you my story if you tell me yours. - Some other time. - How about tonight? - I really don't think so. - Hey, what happened to that friendly service? Come on, we could trade life stories over some real food. - This is real food. If that'll be all. - Why not have somebody wait on you for a change? - Really? - Really. I won't bite, if that's what you're afraid of. - A gentleman never bites. We'll go for drinks anyway. - Fair enough, drinks it is. Carmen's? 9-ish? - 8-ish. - 8-ish. - Big tipper. - He can afford it. - Hey, what's up? We pretty much got the place to ourselves. - And I'm on break. - Oh, what? No pie and coffee? - How'd you like that coffee to go? - This guy really put you through the ringer, huh? - Not exactly the best 6 months of my life. - Well, look. The good news is he doesn't remember you. - Well, I never really met him and he certainly doesn't know Dee Dee Martin. Martin's my maiden name. It's what I gave him. - You know, a guy like that, it's just business. He's working your husband and you're just background. Wallpaper. Anyways, look, 6 months, 1,500 miles later he lands in your lap. - You know, when I saw him just sitting there, I didn't know what to do. I just wanted to... - You've got his name, his number, his address. I mean, you've got a dinner date. - I just wanted to keep him talking. I thought maybe drinks, I could get him to tell me some more, or... - You did good, Dee Dee... Diane. How about I go pay Mr. Taylor a little visit. You know, put the fear of God in him? - He'll just run. - Yeah, he would just run. Print up some more business cards, start someplace else in a week. - I feel like I'm at the bottom of a pit, you know, and up above there is fresh air and sunlight, people living their lives, and him. - And you want out of that pit. - No... I want him in it. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Wow. Have you been waiting long? - No, that's the thing about owning a company. If I don't do it... - It doesn't get done. Wow, amazing view. - Tell me. You clean up nice. - I could say the same thing about you. - No, really. You belong in West Texas about as much as I do. - So, what are we both doing here then? - Making money, lots of it. - I'm glad one of us is. - Me too. What a waste. - What's a nice girl like me doing working in "The Cash Cow"? - Yeah. College? Husband? - Let's just say sometimes things just don't work out the way you planned. - Did thing work out the way he planned? - He's no longer in the picture. - That's it? That's all I get? No sad tale of marital meltdown, no who's been sleeping in my bed? - Sorry. Just me, starting over. - All right then. To starting over. - My turn. Why Midland, Texas? - Why not? Ranchers and oil barons, they need investment counselling too. But developing a client base: Cold calls, seminars, get-acquainted cocktail parties. - It sounds very social. - All I ever meet are middle aged business prospects and myself coming and going. - You must have help, you know, in your office. People doing things to... - What? A little secretary with a bible belt diploma and a dress size to pick out for her? No, I need somebody who can carry on an actual conversation, make an impression. - It's mostly evenings? - Yeah, it's odd hours. Too much to be part-time, not enough to be full-time. - I'm usually finished by the afternoons. I have been known to carry on an actual conversation, now and then. - You'd be interested? Really? - It depends. - On what? - The pay. - Ah-ha, the profit motive. - Of course, it's what made this country great, or so I'm told. - Well, I'll think about it. Maybe once we get to know each other better. - Isn't that what we're doing right now? - The good news is the market always come back. Long term, they offer the highest return. Better than bonds, gold, commodities and even better than real estate. Now, the really good news is that these historic lows offer us a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy into a highly discounted market, positioning the smart investor to make amazing gains when it takes off again. If you know what to buy. LBOs, IPOs, small caps, large caps, foreign or emerging markets. It's enough to make your head spin. Which of course is where I come in. [ Laughter ] Everybody, this is Dee, my research associate. Dee helps me track market trends, separate the winners from the world coms. Smile for the people, Dee. Thank you sir, thank you for coming. Do you guys have one of my cards? If you have any questions, any at all, please feel free to call. I also have a website. - Wow. Research associate. - Moonlighting waitress might not set quite the right tone. - And I help separate the winners from the world coms, how exactly? - Not yet, but you will. I'll show you how to download this stuff off a dozen websites. There's nothing to it. - [Tape recording]: But you will, I'll show you how to download this stuff off a dozen websites. There's nothing to it. - It's not exactly a confession, is it? - Did you think you were going to hit the bulls eye first time out? Look, just keep him talking, let Memorex do the rest. - Am I close enough? - To what, get a signal? - Yeah. - Let me worry about those things. Just keep doing what you're doing, give it a little more time. - Time. He could be gone tomorrow. - Nah, not when the money's coming in. - I appreciate this. - It's our little secret, okay? Besides, the department doesn't know we're using their gear. - You don't take credit for this? - For what? Going behind Wallace's back? Uh, warrentless surveillance, misuse of government property. This isn't about due process, Diane. - What have you got? Corporate tax cuts? And you, sir. The equity in your home, if you sell it where are you going to live? The Social Security benefit that seems to get smaller and farther away every year. But it's not too late. There's still time to make the system work for you. [ Applause ] Now, what's the one thing you should always ask your investment counsellor? What have you done for me lately? Well tonight, we have your quarterly distribution cheques, and for those of you rolling over your profits, quarterly earning statements detailing the returns you're earning on your returns. And for you first timers-- - Mr. Klein Schmidt. - ...and opportunity, a chance to profit from your neighbour's experience. - That seemed to go well. - Practically a feeding frenzy. Even in this economy you make is seem so easy, so right. - Well, that is the idea. - But retirement money, their kids' college funds. - And your point? - Have you thought about what would happen if they don't turn a profit, if they can't get their money back? - Have they? - Do you always answer a question with a question? - Do you? Look even in the best of times, if they can't afford to take a hit, well, they shouldn't be sitting at the table. What's really on your mind, Dee? - Can we go to jail for this, Mark? - For what? - What we're doing. I mean, the returns these people are getting are... - What? Incredible? Impossible? You've seen the cheques. - I know, it's just how could you be the only person offering these amazing returns. It just... It all seems a little bit too good to be true. - Well, if it's too good to be true, you're dealing with an amateur. But if it's too good to pass up, well then maybe he's a pro. - That's you. A pro. - Buy you a drink? Out of the army all I could find were low pay, dead end jobs, and now I average 500K, tax free, new car every year, I travel where I want, when I want. Nobody tells me joe. - How so? - I'm good at what I do? - Investment counselling. - You know why people don't look a gift horse in the mouth? - They might not like what they see. - And are they looking? Is anybody looking? - I don't get it. - What's great about this country: It's all about marketing. You don't really have to produce anything. If the package looks good enough, nobody even bothers to read the label. - So, what are you saying? - It's all just sales. Churn. Money changing hands. Let the buyer beware. The sizzle, not the steak. - So, that's what we're selling. Sizzle. - Is that a problem? - Is that an offer? - Would you like it to be? - No one wants to be a research associate forever. - All right then. Now here's the deal. - Well, well, well! If it isn't Mark Taylor! Long time, no see. Hmmph! I might have known you'd be sitting with the pretties girl in the room. - Chason. - Well, where are your manners boy? Come on. What? Cat got that silver tongue of yours? - Dee, this is Chason Boggs. - His favourite investor. Not that he's been acting like it lately, but I'm surely pleased to make your acquaintance darling. - Dee Martin, my partner. - Mr. Boggs. - Call me Chase. Well this here's one closed mouthed son of a bitch. Never even let on he had a partner, let alone such a good looking one. - I'm a silent partner. - Ah, well. Darling, don't you ever be silent on my account. - Thank you, Mr. Boggs. Chase. - There you go. That's more like it. Waiter! Waiter, my friends are running dry over here, and keep 'em coming! I do kind of lay it on kind of thick, huh? Well, when in Rome. Just a lonely exile, Dee. Stranger in a strange land. but, we're about to change all of that aren't we son? - Huh? - As soon as I get you up there to meet the family. - The family? - Chicago. - The windy city. - How would you know? The closest you ever got was buying a ticket and never even got on the plane. Stood me up. - Chason, I couldn't help it. - Twice! Nobody does that to me. Do you know how that made me look? Huh? Like I belong out here in this pissant prairie. - All right then. Look, if it's that big a deal. - Hey, you'll go? Huh? When? - Whenever. Just set it up. - All right. I will, again. But it's really got to happen this time, for both our sakes. - All right then. - All right. All right. Yee haw! I'll drink to that! Ha-ha-ha! Waiter! Come on now! We're celebrating here! Huh? Ha-ha! - Ha-ha! Ha-ha! [ Slurring now ] What's a guy got to do to get a drink around here? - All right, all right. We're going to get you home there cowboy. - Whoa-ho-ho. - All right, steady. It looks like I'm his designated driver. Here, take my car, partner. We'll catch up with you tomorrow. - Okay, okay. - Say goodnight Chason. - Good night, Chason. - Oh, excuse me. - Hey. - Hey, what're you doing here? - Hi. You got last night's tape? - Yeah, they're in my locker with all the rest, but... - Do you think Wallace is here yet? - Whoa, Diane. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We are not ready-- - You heard him, he admitted... his payouts are too good to be true. Sizzle, not steak? Come on. - But we need proof. That's not proof. - There is enough on that tape to at least get Wallace interested. - Okay, he's not going anywhere. - We don't know that. - He just made you his partner. - That's what he does. He makes promises and then he's gone. - Look, Diane, I don't think it's a good idea to see Wallace. You need to have hard evidence. - Hey, I am telling you. Detective Wallace, the man that I told you-- - How did you get in here? - The man I told you about-- - You're supposed to check in at the front desk, get a visitor's I.D. - He calls himself Mark Taylor. - I thought I explained to you about jurisdiction. - He is running a phoney investment scheme right here in your town. Detective please, I have proof. Just listen to this tape. That's all I'm asking. - Make it quick. [ Tape is blank ] - Okay. [ Tape is blank ] I don't understand why it's not working. - What happened? - Uh, it's blank. - What? Murdoch, what is this doing here?! This is the Sheriff's department. They should have been safe. - But how could they all be blank? - That thing on the counter, it's a degausser, a powerful electromagnet. We use it to bulk erase surveillance tapes. - Erase? - It belongs in the evidence room, not sitting next to my locker. - Erased?! - Diane, listen, I'm sorry. I... Somebody... Diane, I will go to Wallace myself, okay? I will go to him, I'll explain everything. I'll tell him what was on the tapes. Listen to me. He's going to listen to me. I will tell him. Diane. [ Phone ringing ] - "Cash Cow". Table for 6... uh... yeah, I think we can make that happen Miss. Seagle. Can I get a number? Great. See you then. - A guy picks up an envelope off the street. It's practically right under your nose. A thousand bucks inside. It's just luck. You could have picked it up as easy. So, he'll split it with you if can prove you're a solid citizen yourself. You put up 500 of your own money, so you seal the envelop just to be sure, go down to your ATM, withdraw the cash and trade him your five hundred for the envelope with a thousand. Congratulations, you've just made $500 for being in the right place at the right time. But, when you go back to deposit the envelope. There's nothing inside but blank pieces of paper. - Wow. How did you do that? - The mother of all cons. Just a pigeon drop. All you need is the pigeon himself, a good line of patter, preferable a partner to distract him while you make the switch and of course, the all important seed money. - So, that's what a partner's for. Distraction. - Why don't you ask old Boggs once he sobers up. - Sounds like a game. - Real life Survivor. Out think, out manoeuvre the other guy. But, if you lose, you better have a dream team of lawyers standing by. - And if you win? - You can afford to double down the next time. More seed money, bigger pot, higher stakes, bigger winnings. - So, what's the game we're playing now? - Musical chairs. The money goes round and round. You pay the early investor a fat return out of the new investors' contributions, you bank the rest, replenish your seed money. - And when the music stops? - We get Texas in our rear view mirror. - So, when do I quit my day job? After you get back your seed money? - It's not about the money. - Oh, it's about the money. - Okay, it's about the money. - Yeah. - But it's also a way to keep score. It's all about being faster, smarter, better. So, are you in? - And my seed money, partner? - 20% of the take. - 40. - Hey, it's my con. You're coming late. - Yeah, but will you still respect me in the morning. - Well, it looks like I've created a monster. You still got my keys? - So, tonight profit cheques came out of last week's investments. - Did I say that? - Didn't you? And next week's profit cheques will come out of tonight's take. - Take. That's such an ugly word. - And what's left over, where does that go? - Operating expenses. Seed money. - Mark, if I'm going to be your partner I really need to understand how this works. - Give me the briefcase. - Aaah!! - Hand it over. - All right, all right. You really don't want to do this. - Come on. Don't make me ask you again! - All right, all right, take it easy. There's a lady here. There you go. You okay? - Yeah, you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Robert Tawn, does it ring a bell? - No, no. Shouldn't we call 9-1-1? - You're smarter than that, all right? This only works if we stay under the radar. No police reports, no photos in the paper, and when we leave... - No loose ends. - Just Texas in our rear view mirror. A $500 case, ruined! $1,500 suit. - Oh my God. 92nd... - Airborne. Desert storm. - So that's where you learned to fight like that? - That's where I learned a lot of things. - Whoa, guys with knives? Fist fights? If you ask me, you're getting mighty deep here. - He ruined my life. - Okay, I respect that, I do, but sometimes... sometimes we've just got to tell ourselves little lies, you know? Just to get through the day. Like mine used to be that Dennel's daddy's coming back someday. Maybe yours... maybe yours is Rand and the gun thing. - Cerise. - No, no. I know what humped and dumped feels like, all right? I've been there. And if this was all about just this Mark guy then you'd be out a nice house and all that money, but you'd still have a husband. - He killed my husband. - No! Ain't nobody pulled that trigger but Rand. What he did, he did for him, not for you. [ Locker slams shut ] - You have no right. You don't know anything about my life. - Well, I know... I know he made this mess all by himself and left you to clean it up. I know that you don't owe him. He left you. Are you listening to me? - [Mark]: Thank you. Excellent. I'm ready. - Hey. - Hey there. Did somebody rob a bank? - Not me. - Looks like you're going to be paying off that head gasket for the rest of your life. - Yeah, it feels like it. - For whatever it's worth, your credit's real good around here, sweetheart. - Thank you. - Dee, isn't it? Dee Martin. Chason Boggs, we met the other night. - Yes, of course. - Yeah. Not one of my finer moments if I recall. Perhaps I can make amends with a little libation. - Oh well, thanks, but I've really got to get to the laundry. - I just need a minute of your time, Dee. - Oh, Mr. Boggs, maybe-- - Ah, Chase, please. Dee, I don't mind telling you that I am more than just a little concerned. Chicago. Mark. That boy's already stood me up, twice. I like you, Dee. I truly do. But I can't afford another last minute snafu. Not this time, and you being his partner and all, I want to impress upon you just how important it is that if there's anything I should know about that boy's elusive behaviour, this'd be a mighty good time to share it. - Mr. Boggs. Is that your car parked over there in a handicapped zone? - If I can afford that car, Deputy, I can surely afford a parking citation. - I'm sure you can, but I don't think that impound driver knows the right way to hook up a Caddy. - Nice visiting with you, darling. You give some thought to what I said. Hmm? - See ya' cowboy. - Deputy. Hey! Hell, what are you doing?! - [Whispering]: He had a gun. - This is Texas, everybody has a gun. - [Whispering]: He threatened me with that gun. - Relax, it's okay, calm down. - [Whispering]: He threatened me! - Relax, relax. It's okay. Look, I'm really sorry about the tapes. - Yeah, I am too. It wasn't your fault, I just really wanted to get him. - We will, okay? I'm not going to let you down this time, I swear. - Thanks. - Come here, I want to show you something. A place where I like to go when I'm off duty. *** Carl's ice house #2. Back in the days before air conditioning, people used to come to places like this, get ice for their ice boxes and well, just cool off. Hey. - How do they stay in business? - Well, mostly they don't. AM/PMs, Win Dixies sprouting up all over. The last of a dying breed. This one kind of fell through the cracks. - [Speaking spanish]: Hola. Qué tal? - [Speaking spanish]: Muy bien, gracias. Vamos a tomar dos cervezas, tacos, enchiladas y un plato de guacamole. - Feels good, huh? Being home with your own. - These are my roots, chica. - Wish you'd recorded what he told me the other day. - What was that? - How the scam works, what a partner does. Pretty much everything. - Well, then it's not too late. I will not let you down, Diane. Not this time. [ Speaking Spanish ] - Gracias. Salute. [ Clink ] [ Salsa music ] [ Speaking Spanish ] You're doing very well. - Well, gracias seniora... senior. - [Speaking spanish]: Senior. Yo soy senior! - My Spanish is... Out, out. - And... good, good. [ Romantic music ] Would you like to dance? - Okay. [ Laughter ] - You're okay? [ Sigh ] - It's just... It's been awhile. [ Lovemaking ] - Oh! Thank you. - You look nice. - All the comforts of home. - Its freshly squeezed. I have a tree out back. - Thank you. - So breakfast. I have eggs, bacon or sausage... - How long have you known Nando, Cerise? - I've been serving him breakfast for 5 years now. - Did you know he's got a tattoo? A howling eagle. Just like Mark's. - Really? - I mean, it's identical. I mean, why would you have a 92nd Airborne tattoo if you weren't part of the 92nd Airborne? - No, the question is why would you be jumping out of perfectly good airplanes. Okay, sorry. Same tattoo, same unit? So, you're thinking Mark knows Nando. - Well, I'm thinking there's a lot more to this than them just knowing each other. Nando? Hello? [ Sigh ] [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? Ah, I'm at home. I forgot my damn cell. I guess I was a little distracted last night. Come on, remember, I'm her knight in shining armour. Mr. Policeman, protecting her against Boggs and hey, I'm helping her nail you. Yeah, no, no, no. I don't kiss and tell. Okay, I do. Yeah, listen buddy, by tomorrow we are going to have Texas in our rear view mirror. Yeah, yours truly is going to be behind... far behind. Back to the station. [ Car starting and driving away ] - Partners, they're in this together. - Oh my God. But why? - 500K, tax free, a new car every year. - I still don't... - Mark talks a great game. Nando helps his old army buddy out to get established. The money starts rolling in and he just loves that pay hike, until I show up. - No, because you said that he never even met you. - Well, they work it out. And now they need to keep me quite or discredit me while Mark finishes his scam. So, Nando volunteers to help me play detective. - All right, so you call the sheriff with this. - And accuse one of their own? After my little blank tape fiasco? - Right. - I'm going to need a lot more than this. - Just getting off that plane with just a cheque in my hand won't cut in son. - Well, then I'll wire the funds. They'll be there waiting in the morning. - Money talks, Michael. It's psychological and we've got ourselves an impression to make. - Chason, $750,000 is a lot of cash to be carrying around. - In Chicago, I want to see the look on their faces when we open that case and show them all of that green. - It's your money. - You bet. - [Softly]: Password. Howling eagle. Yes. Yes. Yes. - You'll need to sign an authorization so I can withdraw the cash out of your client trust account. What are you doing here? - I thought maybe you could use some help, partner. - Everything's under control, but a buyer sees you in that outfit. - That's why I came in the back. Your briefcase. - I picked up a new one at Niemans. - Oh. Looks just like the other one. - That's why they call it mass production. - What's that? - It's paperwork. Everything's got to look good for Boggs. For some reason he doesn't trust me. - Imagine that. - He seems to like you well enough though. Come out to the airport this afternoon. See us off. Remind him we're all on the same team. - Mark! Mark, I haven't got all day! - Shouldn't you get going? - Pan Western, 5:30 flight. - Okay. Well, I may as well address some envelopes, take out the trash while I'm here. - Be there by 5. - Okay. - What was I thinking? That I was going to beat him at his own game? He's so far ahead of me that I don't even know what the game is. - Whatever it is, him and Nando sure went to a whole lot of trouble to suck you into it. [ Sigh ] What are you going to do? - What can I do? What can I do? The only proof I've got is locked up in that office. - And you know who's going to end up holding the bag on this? - Yeah, his partner. - He figures you're onto him. You know what I'd do if I was in your shoes? I'd put Texas in my rear view mirror p-d-q. - Cerise, I'm not a quitter. - But you ain't no Texas ranger neither. - But he wins. He always wins. He always wins. Hmmph! - Come on. [ Knock at door ] - Mark. - They'll never let you in the first class lounge dressed like that. Get changed and we'll drive up to the airport together. - Oh, you don't really need me to do you? - Well, you wouldn't want to disappoint old Boggs, plus if you keep my car overnight, think of what we'll save on parking. - Mark, I've had a headache all afternoon. I think I'm coming down with something. - Really? - Ooh, careful. - You feel fine. - It's viral. I think it could be catching. - Let's go, we don't have time for this. [ Snapping fingers ] [Mark]: I don't want to miss that flight, partner. Dee Martin, my partner. - So, that's what a partner's for? Distraction. Mark, your briefcase. - I picked up a new one at Neimans. [ Phone ringing ] - Hello? - Cerise, I figured out the game. - What game? - His game. He's not letting go of 750 grand. I need your help. We don't have a lot of time. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it. - Hey. - Hey. - What's this? Bomb threat? - Nah, it's just routine. - Yeah, I thought that was homeland security. - Me too. I'm going to need you to clear out the lounge while I check things out, okay? - Looks like this is it for me. Tell Boggs I'm sorry I missed him. Car keys? - I got you covered, e-ticket. You'll cash in when you pick me up tomorrow. - Hmm, you think of everything. - I try. - Everything okay? - [Spanish]: Si todo bien. You can start letting people back in. - Thank you. - Okay. - I am still keeping your car overnight? - Right. - Parking. - [Annoncer]: Your attention please, the flight number 214 for Washington is now boarding... - Looks like we're early. - Control the room. Control the table. Control the game. - That's it. That's what it's all about. - Always. - No thanks. - We drink, he drinks. Scotch, rocks. And for the lady... - Scotch please. Water back. Have you ever lost control? - It hasn't happened yet. - You're good. - Heh-heh. Mark. - Chason. - Dee. - Chase. - Looks like I had nothing to worry about after all. Glad you could see us off, darling. Well, looks like you got a head start on me. - Plenty of time to catch up. - Your finest Kentucky bourbon, darling. Straight up, keep 'em coming, hmm? Okay, now what are we taking to Chicago besides a change of underwear? Whoo! [ Laughter ] Wooeee! Oh! I can't wait till I see their faces. [ Cell phone ] - Excuse me a minute. This is Mark. Uh-huh. Well, I have a meeting in Chicago, Frank, and I'm already at the airport. Yes, I understand but... okay, all right. Look, let me see what I can do. All right, I'm going to have to let you know. Frank Garfield. - Frank. How's Frank doing? - He's talking about investing, a million and a half. - When you're hot, you're hot, huh? - Well, it's a big first time number, even for somebody like him. He needs a little hand holding. Chason, I don't even know how to ask-- - Been there son, done that. - I can't afford to lose an investor this big, and neither can the fund. - You owe me. I promised the guys they were going to meet Mr. Wizard, twice. - I understand, but he wants to talk now. Now, if I can meet with him I can close him, but this guy gets cold feet overnight. Look I don't... What if... What if Dee went with you? - What? Instead? - Well, I know it's a lot to ask but she is my partner and you already have a ticket. - That I do. - Besides, the important thing is what's in here: 750K of pure profit. - Well, it beats cancelling, again and she is your partner. - Silent partner. Mark, I am really-- - I'm sorry, Dee, but stuff happens and we're a team right. Just show the flag, I'll do the heavy lifting the next trip. Here, get whatever you need in Chicago, I'll take care of anything else when you get back. - Thanks, partner. - [Announcer]: This is a 1st boarding call for Pan Western flight 308 to Chicago. - Here's to our flight. - [Cerise]: You call this a drink?! I ordered a Bloody Mary, not some cheap ass Shirley Temple! Where's the manager?! Now! - All in good time, Dee. All in good time. [ Laughter ] - They let anybody fly today. - You know, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to use the ladies room. - Don't be long. - I guess I don't need to tell you what would have happened if we had had a problem with that money? Huh? After two false starts. Well, these Chicago guys, they have this reputation for shooting the messenger. Literally. - Clockwork, Chason. Trust me, it's all going like clockwork. - Tick-tock. Vanity thy name is woman. [ Phone ringing ] Here, darling. Go on. Go on and tell moneybags Garfield you're going to come hold his hand. Uh-uh. Not that I don't trust you. - I'll call you back. What? - [Nando]: Hey, we've got a big problem. - You're telling me. I'll get back to you when I find her. - [Nando]: Okay, there's no time. We're just outside. Women. - Did you round her up? We've got to make tracks. - Dee's not feeling well, Chason. On second thought, I'm going to join you in Chicago. - Well, there you go. - Detective Dwight Wallace, Midland County Sherrif's Department. We got a call about a suspicious package. - Well, we're just having a drink waiting for our flight. - Then you won't mind showing what's in the briefcase. Under the table. - Detective, I think you need a warrant don't you? - You want to dot the Is and cross the Ts, we gotta go downtown, find a judge. You'll miss your flight. It's up to you. - It's all right, Chase. Satisfied? - Now the other one. - Other one? What other one? - Nothing suspicious here detective, just good old American... paperwork. - See, that's the problem with anonymous phonecalls, sir. - Are we done here? - Sorry for the inconvenience. You gentlemen have a good flight. - After we've had a closer look at the goods. Paige Seagle, Midland County, DA. - A closer look? What exactly are you looking for? - Financial records. An unlicensed investment fund. Possible ponzi scheme. - Ponzi scheme. You slimey son of a bitch. I'll break your skull! - Get him off me! - We'll be taking those into custody. - Wait, wait, you can't just come in here and start seizing private papers. - Exigent circumstances. You can debate the fine points at your arraingment. - You're a dead man, Taylor! You hear me?! Dead! - Nando. Nando. - I don't know you pal. - Wait a minute. Nice phone. You mind? - Would it matter if I did? - No. - Listent... listen to me. It's probably some kind of cell phone glitch. You know, I've had trouble with that phone. It goes off, wrong number. Who put that there? That's not my case. - Then you won't mind if we open it. - Come on. - Okay, Dwight, this is a set up. - How did she know this? You set me up! You set me up you son of a-- Where is she?! Where the hell is she?! - Your personal identification number, up to 10 letters and numbers. - Yes. The pin is "seed money", not that you'll need it with a court order. Safe deposit box #1056. - How do you know so much about this? - He told me. Little by little, everything. - And all those identical briefcases? - [Dee on speakerphone]: He loved the audience. Someone to appreciate how smart he was. I just listened. I had some help. Here's to our flight. - You call this a drink?! I ordered a Bloody Mary, not some cheap ass Shirley Temple! Where's the manager. I want to see the manager now! - All in good time, Dee. All in good time. - They'll let anybody fly today. - Excuse me, I'd like to use the ladies room. - Don't be long. - Those financial records, all the people he's been defrauding here. Where did they come from? - One man's trash is another man's treasure. - I could offer you immunity from prosecution for your testimony. - You've got all the evidence you need. - A dozen aliases, hundreds of victims. Millions in fraud, maybe so, but still. - All I want is restitution. - Sometimes I wonder if there really is such a thing. - You never get your life back. But there are compensations. - Wow. - If you hadn't of called here that night. How did you get my private number anyway? - You gave it to me. - I did? I know you? - I wouldn't expect you to remember. - What are you, some kind of ponzi scheme vigilante? - Miss Seagle, I did what I had to do. - You were one of his victims. - Not anymore. - What did he do to you? What did he take? - More than you could possibly imagine. But that's the past. - I could be having this call traced you know. - And I could be on a cell phone right down the street. Or I could have Texas in my rear view mirror. Closed captioning: Technicolor, Creative Services - Montreal
