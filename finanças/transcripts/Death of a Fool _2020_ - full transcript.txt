Oye, you missed the flamingos. - Are we close? - Almost there, partner. Look alive, will you? - Hmm, here. - He looks like a nice kid. - Few weeks ago his ex-girl took off. That's when he started acting strange. - How? - He got a pet bunny. - Well, after all, the boy did just get his heart broken. - I told him, "Clarence, don't let the girl move in here. "Two women under the same roof means trouble." But the youth don't listen. Anyhow, that night, I was knitting in this chair. Next thing I know Clarence's hands are around my neck and his eyes are dark and distant. The room got really hot. Smelled like burnt flesh. I felt an evil presence behind him watching me till I passed out. When I woke, I found myself on the floor covered in ashes. - And Clarence? - I told you, he was taken by Satan. - Um, Gertrude, on the phone you said that you had physical proof that Clarence had been taken, you know, to Hell, I mean. - He's been communicating with me. At night I hear his voice whispering in pain like his throat's been cut. I wake up, I have these scratches. He uses my blood to send me messages. And a few days ago he told me where he is. Where? - Your ad says you work free of charge. Did I read that right? - I think we're gonna have to decline. - But I need your help. - Your son is alive, living in Vegas with his ex-girl. And you, you just want a free ride. But what about the scratches, Abuelo? - Are you calling me a liar? - No, no, no, no, no. But you see, nightmares and the afterlife are two different things. - You're afraid of what you'll find. - I'll tell you what I'll find. I'll find a son who fled the nest trying to get away from his mother's ghost. - Out, imposters, out with you! Out! Get outta here! - Next time be meticulous about your fact-checking so we don't have to drive over here all the time. - She couldn't show me the evidence on the phone, Abuelo. Oh, she ran out of ketchup writing on her wall. - So the girlfriend is Satan? - Ah, she and Clarence probably wanted to get rid of the old girl. - Oh, at least he left her alive. - Well, of course. Otherwise it would have been murder. They probably didn't wanna end up in jail. - Or Hell. Abuelo, are-- - It's so cold. Are you okay? You're sweating. Should I call 9-1-1? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay, it's okay. It's just a stomach pain. Then why are you holding your chest? - What? If it's stomach pains, why are you holding your chest. - It's all connected. Listen, why don't you take the wheel, huh? Come on. Did you bring your permit? - Yeah but-- Go, go. Ah. - I'm going, you have to put this it in. Look. There we go. Okay, thank you, Abuelo. - Baby, I had to borrow your bathing suit. But I'll be back pronto. Okay, call if you need anything, - You guys are back early. - What was that tune you were playing? I like it. - Oh, I never learn the titles, just the melodies. - Oh, keep on playing it. Maybe will lighten the mood. You got it, Herman. - Hey. - Hey, you, how was it? - You know, slow progress. - Oh, buck up, buddy. Maybe you weren't meant to be an afterlife investigator. Maybe you were meant to be a musician. - What? - Come with me tomorrow to my music group. You could pick something up like a piano or a guitar or flute. - I gotta file this. - You can find other hobbies and Herman, too. You should see your faces every time you get back from a case. - We always have fun. You just never see it. - All I see here is a bunch of fake stories. - Okay, well, what if one day we actually get a small clue that the afterlife exists, hmm? I mean, don't you ever wanna know if people aren't really gone? - Maybe you should focus a little bit more on this life and come with me tomorrow. Be normal for once. - I have to take Abuelo to the hospital tomorrow. - Oh, sorry. I can take you. - No, no, no, it's cool. You do your thing and we'll just take a cab. - You sure? - Yeah, yes. - All righty. - Which pill is that? - Relax, Pablito, it's only aspirin. - Yeah, and you're gonna OD on it if you don't slow down. - I already told you, I had too much breakfast. - We need to change your diet. There's too much red meat. It's all connected like you always say. - There you go again with the red meat. You need to stop listening to the internet. Look, you know that one day we're gonna be apart, huh? Ah, that will only be temporary. - If you truly believe that then what's the point of even looking for proof? - Well, even if you knew the answer, don't you still want to ask the question? There's nothing wrong with me. The only thing is that my thumb keeps falling off. Look. See? - Abuelo, I think I'm a little too old for that trick. It's not a trick. You do it. - It looks bad. You can keep coming here every week. It's up to you, Hermano. The Lord knows we're doing our best. - Eh, I think this is working. Hmm? - Yeah, yesterday's incident coulda been just stress. - Well, it could also be the sickle cells causing lung damage, hence, the acute pain in your chest. - Are you trying to get rid of me, Perdomo? We both know you always like the truth. Pablito's gonna need a new legal guardian. Have you thought about that? What? - Pablito, please step out. Doctor needs to check my prostate. - Why don't you do things his parents used to do with him? - Hey, we're doing something important here. My daughter would've approved. - You'll see the Heavens, Herman. Sooner or later we all do. - Oh, there are other places than Heaven. Hmm. - So? What did Dr. Perdomo say? - Everything is stable. Although I must say that I was a little bit concerned there for a second. Pablito, I did wanna talk to you. - Why? - Well, I think maybe, just maybe, we should take a little break from the investigations, eh? - Oh. - Just for now, just for now. It's your summer vacation. And we can pick up the slack later. - Sure, and you need your rest, too. It's, it's a good idea. - Great. - Gertrude is dead. - Pardon? - Gertrude, she had a stroke or heart attack. Can't remember. - Really? I am so sorry. Are you related? That woman was a waste of life and one of your worst clients probably. It's nice to meet you, Herman. Looking to enlist your services. - Sorry, sir, I don't know which ad you saw, but we don't provide any services. - Hmm. We only provide assistance. - Just need your help to find something, something you've already found once before for someone else. - What? - The fruit. It's still in the same place you last saw it, its potential being wasted. - And who may I ask wants it? - Can only reveal my identity if you choose to assist. - Abuelo. Let's go. - Maybe trying to convince the wrong person. How would you like your grandfather to have eternal life? - What kind of fruit are you talking about? - The fruit, from the tree of life. Immortality is possible with your help. - Right. Let's go, Abuelo, come on. Come on! - Good day, sir. We should at least consider it. - What happened to taking a break? - I don't know but this is unexpected. It's almost like fate. - Right, Abuelo, fate. And how does that guy even know your name? - No idea. But think about it. Today, we were giving up, and now this suddenly falls in our laps? - This has nothing to do with the afterlife. All he did was babble about some tree, fruit thing. - Just a fruit, no tree. I've seen it on a past investigation. But I wonder how he knows about it. - Well, we're not gonna find out. We're not gonna drive around with your stomach pains. - I know. And you're right. Let's go home, come on. - Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - Didn't exactly make a stellar first impression back there. The name's Dee. - Get out of our house. - Dee, listen closely. - Careful there, Herman. You don't wanna step in that now. You two like to think of yourselves as believers. Yet, you go around doubting everything and everyone. Thus, brought you living proof. Look familiar? - Is that Gertrude's? I'm gonna call the cops and animal control. - Wait, wait, Pablito, wait. - What? - He forgot to put the carrot in. - Better watch or you'll miss it. Go. Shoo, shoo. No! - Oh. That's a good little boy. Yes. - That was a pretty cool trick. - No, no, no, no, no, not a trick. - Where did you get the rabbit? - It came to me. After Fabio died. - Fabio's dead? - For a long time. He left behind this recipe for an elixir which he tested on this rabbit. But recovering the key ingredient has become an obstacle. - And you, you want me to get it for you? - For us. I mean, once you locate the fruit, the elixir can be made again and shared with the both of you. Quid pro quo. - Okay, I don't know how you put together this optical illusion, but we're-- - Wanna test it yourself, hmm? There's a way out of your predicament. Contribute, you won't have to worry about the afterlife. You can stay together. Here, in this life. This is the complete recipe. Now, Fabio's widow tried making the elixir herself unsuccessfully. - What, did that come with the rabbit, too? - The boy still hasn't learned to ask the right questions, hmm? - Does she still has the fruit? - Yes. You know the layout of her place, but most importantly, you know what the fruit looks like. Hence, my proposal. - I think you know a little bit too much. - An investigator's only as good as his sources. I'll be back in a couple of hours. - Hold on, we didn't agree to help you just because you came in-- - Start packing. Real blood. But, but how? - No trick. - I just don't understand. I mean, this whole thing with the woman and then the fruit. - Irene, she's the one that hired me to find the fruit. - Well, why doesn't she know how to make the elixir? - That's a good question. - I don't know, Abuelo. This guy shows up and he says that he's an investigator but at the same time he chops up bunnies? Even if it's all true and we could become immortal, he's probably just gonna use us to get the elixir for himself. - Maybe we should let this one slide. Hmm? - Although, if it does work, this could be our chance to find something real. - That's pretty strong evidence. - We could be like vampires. - Well, well. Hmm, maybe we should try it this time. But if it gets risky, we are out. - Okay, Abuelo, but this time, I'm in charge. - Hey, how'd it go with the doc? Did you guys kill a bear? - It's gonna be a long drive so we're gonna need a driver and a regular car. - Okay, you guys are clearly busy. I'll come back later. - No, wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Listen, I know it's weird. I just need your help one day. Just the rabbit thing. Listen, we're talking immortality. I need this-- - Okay, Herman, I'll be your pilot. Let me grab the keys to my mom's car. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, slow down. I meant your mom should drive us. - No, I got it. - Unn unn, we still need her permission. - Me, gone a few days? She'll be relieved. - Must say, it adds some nice flavor bringing along a lovely young lady with us, especially one so keen on flirting with danger. - Yep. Who doesn't like a little fear with their death? I mean, unless you can't die, of course, like Fluffy back there. - Hey, so I was thinking when we get there we should just tell the lady that we were close by-- - Oh no, no, no, no. Irene might recognize me. I would have a lot of catching up to do. - Relax, Abuelo, you look nothing like those old pictures you're always showing me. - Let's see the location first then we choose our approach. - Any information you wanna share? - You'll find out soon enough. - Dude, why are you always so mysterious. It's not helping. - Shh. - You shush. - So what's the deal with this fruit? Is it a papaya, an apple, a raspberry? It's sacred. - What do you mean? - Supposedly it grew from a tree whose fruits were fed by the Fountain of Youth. As a detective, I thought it was a silly request, but eventually I tracked it down in the Everglades. After that, my job was complete so I let them be. I can show you what the fruit looks like if you let us read the recipe. - And how does one know that's the real fruit? - How do we know you have the real recipe? - How do we know God's real? I mean, no one's ever seen the man or woman. - Hey! We will be extremely vulnerable if we cannot trust each other. - It's hideous. - Well, I never said I was an artist. - Enough. - Okay, okay. - There's a motel near Irene's place. Let's get some rest. We'll get a fresh start tomorrow morning. Sure. - Welcome to the Omega Motel. Need a room? Our rooms have plenty of room. Four people, one room. - Hey, we, we really need a plan. - We still need to see Irene's house. You can sleep now. - I thought you wanted to rest. - Where do you suggest one lie? Can you both quit it? I can't sleep with all this negative energy. Pardon me. - Bea. Psst. - What? - Abuelo, hurry. Come on. - Pack your bags and go home. - Well, someone needs some manners. - Uh, sir, can I go now? I really don't like confrontation. - Good job. Stay sharp. - I think you have the wrong idea, sir. We mean no harm. - You mentioned the lady Irene when you came in? Who sent you? - No one. - We've come to join you. The House of Nothing welcomes the churchless, does it not? - You, you smell of faith, blind faith that found its way to our doorstep before, only wishing to destroy what we've built. - Inform the lady of the house that we will pay her a visit tomorrow morning. Only she can determine our worth. - The House of Nothing? - Irene's recruited a group of outcasts to help her remake the elixir. We just met two of them. - Well, they were peeping inside my room and where I come from, they're called perverts. - Mmm, having eyes everywhere is the best way to spot your enemies. - What enemies? - Every religious person. - And you didn't consider mentioning this to us? - It was difficult enough to get you out here. You're the one that said Irene's name. They were just trying to scare us off thinking we were after her. Now there's only one way in. May I help you? - Good morning, sir. We're here. - And? - We're here to join you guys, remember? I think I hit his good eye. - What makes you think we would accept you? - Thought this interview would be conducted by the lady of the house not a mere servant. - She respects my opinion very much. - Listen, buddy, we know you don't like new faces and I'm sure she appreciates your loyalty, but why don't you do your job and let us in to speak with her? - Don't look back. It's very rare that someone knocks on my door eager to submit themselves to the House of Nothing. There must be a great explanation of why there are four of you here right now. I'm listening. - We come from further south. Our church and God expelled us and we've been searching for guidance ever since. - I'm not a guide. I don't pretend to explain the ways of the universe. - Perhaps, but-- - You've said enough. Why are you here? - We've been religious people our whole lives, so-- - I'm asking you why did your church cast you out? - My grandfather brought me here and so I-- And what do your parents have to say? - They have nothing to say. - Nice outfit, ma'am. - Madam. With what lies did you raise your grandchildren? - We were raised Catholics. Stories about this house made us curious. Maybe here we can find a new purpose. - Curiosity is only the first step. To earn your place in this house, you must remove Jesus from your heart completely. Admit he's a lie, a phony. - Yes. Yes, what? - Yes, Jesus is a damn lie. Please, make us feel whole again. - Mmm nnn. That's still not enough. But let's see, let's see if your two hands at work can do more than a hundred clasped in prayer. - You will now begin the trial period. Let me show you where the new contenders stay. We are always on the alert here for invaders. Some of our religious neighbors like to harass us every chance they get. To warn the other members, you'll be given one of these. Just ring it if you need help. Invaders! - It's just a drill! Stay sharp. Hoo. For today you may observe. Tomorrow you will be expected to contribute. A special plant needs to be harvested frequently. If you have any questions, ask each other. Don't bother anyone. - What the heck are these? - No questions. Take whichever rooms you like. Tonight the lady will announce your presence. Dinner will be served in the grand banquet hall. I shall see you all there. I'm fine, I'm fine. - Abuelo, do you remember anything else about this house? How to get around-- - Sort of, yes. - We already know they don't like visitors so we should keep blending in. - Good point. Some people break very easily. - I didn't break. I just knew that Abuelo would be able to convince Irene to let us stay. He's more credible. Sorry that you had to call Jesus that, but you know, they're just words. They don't actually mean-- - So when we pray, are those just words, too? - No, but, but this is different. It's different, right? - Don't look at me. - It got us this far, Pablito, and that's what we needed. Okay? - Supposed to be observing. Let's partner up and look for some clues. - Right. Let's go, Bea. - Yep. - Clock's ticking. Invaders, invaders, invaders. Invaders, invaders. Get 'em! Get 'em! - Should we help them? - I don't think they need us. Invaders. Invaders! Invaders! Invaders! Invaders! Invaders, invaders! Nothing before life. - Nothing after death. - What? - Their slogan. - Oh. The fruit's not down there. - I know. - Oh, of course. You need to see where Fabio was murdered. - Murdered? - Someone pushed him. The water took care of the rest. - Did they catch him? - Many people wanted his experiments to end. Whoever did this is still running free. Dinnertime. - Go home, Herman. - Have you ever seen a dead body before? - No. - Well, they're not supposed to look this nice. At least my parents didn't. - Come on. - Abuelo, we found Fabio's dead body, frozen in a shed. - Are you sure it was him? - Oh yeah. He looked just like the paintings but dead. - Why would she keep his corpse? - Maybe she still need it for clues, to find his murderer. - Fabio was killed? - So I heard. - There once was a time when all people believe in God. And the church ruled. No wonder we call it the Dark Ages. Today, many still believe in paradise. But one has to be worthy of it. One must live by the rules or be punished for eternity. Oh, oh, my esteemed house, we're closer than ever to showing everyone that God is not needed if we learn to fool death. Nothing before life. Nothing after death. Nothing after death. - As you detected, we have new guests among us. They've asked me to let them join the house. Unfortunately we have no room for wolves in sheep's clothing. - What is this, another test? - Oh no, you already failed. - Pablo, I can't do spicy. - We told the truth. - You mean the truth about you shouldn't spying? Or the truth about what you're doing here? - But you said we could look around. - Let the old man have the first taste. I never saw a purple cow. I never hope to see one. But I can tell you anyhow, I'd rather see than be one. Do you wish to confess? Or maybe it's not hot enough. - Abuelo. - More juice. - Okay, okay. Okay, please stop. We're really here because we're here to find Fabio's killer. Sorry for misleading you, but we care deeply about this case. - Lies. Lies. I only see a weasel trying to squeak his way free. - He was a friend. - Really? And how old are you again? - Well, not my friend. - I didn't know what had happened to Fabio. You never called. You never called. I could help. - How would I call you after the way you left? Herman. Did you really think I wouldn't recognize you? You look just like Father in his last days. - Father? Like a priest? Pablito,. You have a sister? - Half sister. - Can we talk? - Um, can you let us go please? - Unless you wanna feed him broken glass barbecue next. - Answer these questions. If I catch you lying again, I'll... - Blood type? What is this? Are they trying to get our organs? - The younger the better. - Why didn't Abuelo tell me about her? It woulda been nice to know that I had more family. - Nice? Dude, she's off her meds. And good save with that slick lie about Fabio. - Yeah. Let's just hope Abuelo can keep up the story. - I didn't take you for a trickster. - You have developed some torture skills, too, you know. - Best way to learn is through punishment. At least I didn't crucify you. - That's so out of character for you. - There is enough hurt to go around. Oh yes. It was one thing to consider Fabio's research a sin. But, but not hearing from you in decades, that's heartless. - As if you have made a name for it. - You were the one who walked away. - I was too rigid back then. You know things change with age. - So when you renounced your faith this morning-- - I was being flexible. Look, I want to solve this case really. That's the least I could do. But I needed more information before involving you. - What happened to the boy's parents? - They died. My daughter Debbie left me in charge. God's big plan. - I see. And who's the peculiar gentleman that came with you? - He's the reason I'm here. Look, I've been doing afterlife investigations for a while. A fool's errand, I know. The evidence is always scant at best. But then I met this fellow who said he owned an immortal rabbit. So I went to check the story and there he was. - Choncho? Is he still alive? - Well, he's more like the hopping dead. But he's the reason why I learn about Fabio. So the elixir worked. - I still need to see it work on a human. - Looks like Herman's taking matters into his own hands. - Maybe they're just patching things up. - Or sharing valuable information without us. - I'm sure this is all part of his strategy. He'll probably call us in soon. Where are you going? - Need rest. - My theory is that night, one of the religious invaders saw the elixir work on Choncho. So he attacked Fabio and took the ingredients list. But he missed the fruit. It's the last missing piece. - So you think a man did it? - A woman would have succeeded already. - Oh, I'm sure. - I created the house expecting he'd come back to get the fruit. - But do you still have it? - It's the only thing keeping the murderer here. - He's disguised as one of your members? - I've yet to catch him. - Hmm, you may be in danger, Irene. He needs me alive. The fruit will rot away without my care. - Oh, he must be getting desperate. I mean, with you getting older. - I seem to be aging better than you. Only on the outside. I think we need to catch the killer now. - But I have one more question. How did your friend find Choncho? - Sorry to interrupt, madam. We're just worried about Herman. He needs some rest. - Where is the other gentleman? - Oh, he went back to his room. - He found it in a pet store. Make sure nobody leaves the property. Yes, madam. - I think it's best if you all get some sleep. - We'll rest better if we find Dee. - I can give you something from the garden to help you relax. - No, no. No, no, thank you, thank you. - Fine. I'll take you all back to your rooms. Come on. - These pervs have eyes everywhere. - Dee's really complicating things. We need to find the fruit and get out. - Right, yeah, about that. - What? Well, if we succeed, you're not thinking about taking the elixir, too, right? - Well, of course I'm thinking about it. - I mean, I get that you wanna save Herman, but did you consider possibly leaving things the way they are? - But this could be my chance to change everything, Bea, so why wouldn't I? - Okay, well, what about your parents? What if there is an afterlife? Then you'd never see them again. - So now you suddenly believe in Heaven. No. I just, it's just something to consider. - I'm gonna stick with the sure bet, an elixir that can save Abuelo's life. - Okay, fair enough. We'll have better luck tomorrow. - Yeah, for sure. - Good night. - Good night, Bea. - I thought we were here to make the elixir not solve a cold case. - Well, that would be easier to do if you didn't keep disappearing in the middle of the night. - Nah, needed a distraction. With everyone looking around, less eyes on you. Keep watch on Herman. He has a soft spot for his sister. - Half sister. - Soon, could be three hands holding you down. - So you do have more magic tricks up your sleeve. - Magic tricks didn't bring you this far. Door's open, get moving. And remind Herman of the mission before he slips up and things get outta hand. - Can you get the door please? I got it. - How did you get out? - Oh, was I supposed to stay locked in my room? - Pablito, she's just trying to protect you. - Listen, Aunt Irene, I'm on your side here. I spoke to Dee and he's just scared and he's hiding because, you know. - Your house methods. - Exactly. Yeah, I mean, after last night, I wanted to run away, too, but we're family. - We searched for him all night. Does an invisibility cloak? - The man's really good at deception. - Then how do you know Choncho was not a trick? - Choncho? - The rabbit. - Oh. - I want to see if the elixir works on Choncho with my own eyes. - Oh, you will get Choncho back. And he can help us catch Fabio's killer. - How so? - Think about it. The killer saw the elixir work on the rabbit that night. Besides us, only he would be able to recognize him. If he sees Choncho again, he may think the elixir is inside him and may want to extract it. - So he'll try to steal Choncho. - And that's how we catch him. Don't need to endanger the fruit. - The fruit? You mean, the one you helped her get? - Yes. - I hired him. It was not a favor. - He always speaks about that fruit. How magical it is and blah, blah, blah, but Aunt Irene, I'm just like you. I need to see things with my own eyes. - Oh, I'm starting to like the boy. Maybe it's not that bad that he stays. - Stay? - Big brother here thinks it's wise if I take care of you after he's gone. After all, we're family. Don't stress. I'm only considering it, uh? - I'll be 18 soon. I can watch over myself thank you. - Sure you can, champ. - Irene, tell the others to lay back, will you, huh? Dee will come out of his hole soon and we'll talk to him. - The search will be over when I get my hands on Choncho. - If you scare Dee away, you'll never get your hands-- - He won't get away, I can assure you. So that's why you brought me here. - Pablito, I'm working on plan B. Stop trying to make decisions for me without asking me first. - My chest pains are not going away. - Exactly! That's why we need to focus on finding the fruit. - I can get Irene to tell me where it is. - Oh yeah? How? - I'm working on it. - I'm no fool, Abuelo. All you've been talking about since we got here is how to solve Fabio's case. - Hey, you were the one that told her we were here for this. I'm just playing along. - No, you're trying to get on Irene's good side so that she can babysit me. - No. - I mean, look at what she did to you. - You don't really know her that well. Better Irene than a stranger. - She believes that, she believes that Jesus is a phony. - That was my fault. I pushed her down this road. - Listen, if you don't care about finding the fruit and you wanna let yourself die, fine, whatever. - Who knows a route I'll take once you're gone. Bea? - Thanks for knocking. - What's going on? - The rabbit's back. - Where? - I don't know. I left it on the bed two seconds ago. Where's Herman? - He's busy trying to make Irene my legal guardian. - No way. Has he lost his mind? - Yeah, well, I'm not staying here that's for sure. Sneaky. - I think he's waiting for us. - There's something here. Where did she go? - I don't know. All I'm worried about are these damn peppers. - Shh. Listen. - Fabio? - Go home. Yes, I will. - Why aren't you supposed to be here? So this is where you've been hiding. - Haven't been hiding. That's why they're still looking. - Oh, wise guy. Well, listen, Irene knows that you have been spying on her for quite a while. Seeing your skills of deception, it surprises me that you haven't found the fruit yet. - That's why you're here. Then I need the rabbit. - We both know what you need to do. Irene'll give up the fruit if she hears the truth. - What truth? - That no god will free you from your guilt because Irene is the only one who will forgive you. Chose you for a reason. Now, stop creating distractions and play your part. - That's one fricking ugly fruit. - Can we talk? What's wrong? - He was here when I came in. - Listen-- - It doesn't matter now. Let's try your plan with Choncho so we can finally catch the killer. Herman, we're losing time. There's still something bothering me, Irene. Why have you kept Fabio all these years with you? Are you trying to bring him back? - I tried, but keeping his body intact is the best I can do. He deserves more than nothing. - Oh yes, nothing before life, nothing after death, right? You never, never understood contradictions. Always taking the easy way out of things. - You're wrong. Coming here was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. Even harder than the night Fabio died. - But you weren't here that night. - Oh, yes I was. I came looking for you. - What? - Irene! Irene! - Go. Go. What are doing back here? - My sister, where is she? - Not here. - You're lying. Go get her or I'll do it myself. She's coming with me. - I already told you she's not here. - Look, I don't care what kinda wicked things you're doing out here, Fabio, but Irene is not gonna be a part of it. - Wicked? My science will put an end to your blind faith. - Gimme the keys. - Go home, Herman. Choncho! - Fabio turned you against our faith. I was just trying to open your eyes again. I'm sorry. - You've been lying since you walked through my door. - I wanted to tell you the truth in person. But I couldn't find the courage. - I hated this godly town for so long. Time after time searching for someone to punish. - It wasn't my fault. - An innocent man doesn't run! - I didn't know what I was. Ever since my daughter died, it seemed that God was unfairly confirming my guilt. - So you thought that you'd feel better chasing ghosts. No, better than them chasing me. Irene, you have to believe me. I am innocent. You've confessed but some things cannot be washed away! We must be careful. This could be old lady booby trapped. - So neurotic. Here, let me. - Easy. This is really stuck. Ow. What, what happened? - I can't get off. - What? What do you mean you can't get off? - Oh, my arms feel weak, Pablo. - What is this? Oh, I can't feel my arms. - It's gonna be okay. I feel weak. - Let me think. We can, we can probably pull harder. - Go get Irene before this kills me. - Are you crazy? We can't get-- - Pablo, will you go? - Damn it, okay, okay. Just hold on. Oh, I can't believe he just said hold on. - What the hell happened here? - She just panicked. - Beatrice is in danger. We found the fruit but it's hurting her. - We've gone too far. - Stop your whining, Abuelo. Look, Aunt Irene, I apologize about all this. I know we weren't supposed to be in there, it's just, please, can you help me get my friend out? - Are you asking for help? While you're trying to steal from me? - I came here to try and save Abuelo. The fruit was the only way to do that. - So that's why you came back. After condemning Fabio's research for years. You damn hypocrite. - The girl has nothing to do with any of this. I didn't want to drink the elixir. But I'm willing to see if immortality is possible. We all need closure. - Yet you keep Fabio frozen in your basement for years. That's closure? - Let's see how you respond when your friend's body starts to rot! - Irene, this isn't you. Larter! - Stop it! - Larter! Stop it! - Abuelo, you said that you saw the roots bleeding when you found the fruit, right? - Yes. - The fruit was nearly dead? But Fabio kept it alive. - Let's go. Bea, shh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing? Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Pablo. - You're okay, okay. Come on. You got it. - You have to be more careful, muchacha. Your mother woulda killed me. - We need to get outta here. The question is how are we gonna get the fruit to the lab? - Cut the roots. - What are you gonna do now, pull a gun out on us? - I'm not gonna harm you. Only wanna ask you please bury the fruit somewhere where it cannot find blood. - You want to kill it? - What you want is against the rules. Been playing this game since the beginning of time. Never been beaten. - You knew the fruit was here all along. Yet, you still came to us. Why? Cannot kill anything that is alive, only collect what is dead. Could've chosen someone else for this, but humans are quite unreliable. Better to take a chance with Irene's long-lost brother who once knew that this fruit would only bring pain to others. - Well, maybe you choose us wrong. Haven't made my offer yet. You still have a one-way ticket to Heaven. Waited for you to admit your guilt. Now your sins can be forgiven. - What sins? - This can wait, Pablito. The reason he came all the way here, his dirty conscience. - Tell me, Abuelo-- - This can wait, Pablito. - For what? So you can come up with another lie? He's responsible for Fabio's death. Yet he ran away after it happened. But thanks to Herman, I found out about the elixir and have plotted to get rid of it ever since. - You killed Fabio? Of course not, Pablito. It was an accident. Let's call it fate. The truth is, the old man is afraid of meeting the gates of Hell. The elixir sounds like a good way out, but Heaven is more appealing. Mmm, you want proof of the other side? Here it is. You can see your parents again and Herman one day, rest assured. But if you make this elixir and drink it, then... - Show me my parents. Mmm, no can do. Even I have rules to follow. - So the rules only work in your favor. Let's go. Ah, but you need this. - And for once, you're wrong. - I don't need to see it twice to recall a simple formula. You know I would've understood if it was an accident. Sorry, Pablito. I had to tell Irene first. - You could've told Irene the second we got here. - I know, I know, but we also needed the fruit. And now you have it. We have it. Okay, we have it, we. - Stop talking, guys. - Nothing before life. Keep walking. Come on. Act natural. - Well, he was right about something. We found evidence of the afterlife here. - One small clue, yes. - Well, he was wrong about something else though. If there really is a Heaven, then be sure to welcome the best man I know. Uh, bamboo extract. - Uh, uh, shoot, I don't see any. - That's the one thing we're missing. We were so close. I think my flute, I think it has some. - Perfect. Pablo! - What? No one heard me. - Well, how much did you need? - This much. - Is that it? - Yep, should be ready to go. You first, Abuelo. Invader. Invaders. Invaders. Invaders. - Invaders. - Time to go. - Wait! - Invaders! We have to leave. - Trust me, hold on. All right, let's go. Invaders, invaders! Invaders, invaders! Invaders, invaders. - Invaders! - Invaders, invaders! Whew, look. Get away, keep away. Find it? Come on. Great. Good work. - Invaders! Invaders! Invaders! - You okay? - What did you whisper to Irene? - The recipe. Oh great. We're outta gas. I'll be back in a second. - Where's he going? Go with him, - Right. Hey. - Hey. - We should keep watching the road in case someone comes by. I mean, I know you have all the time in the world, but... - What? - Nothing. - Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, do you have a napkin or a bandaid I can borrow? - Oh shoot, you're still bleeding. - Like we all do. - You changed the recipe. But wait, then you didn't need the bamboo. - It had to look real for Abuelo. Now he doesn't have to worry about the afterlife and he'll be at peace. - So no more investigations, huh? - And no more flute. I'll get you a guitar. They sound a little nice. - All righty, I'm gonna go see if someone can stop and help us out. I want a home meal. He always comes back. - I think Dee left him for us. - Should we keep him? He'll be fine on his own. - Anyway, I feel great. - Really? - Yes. I think the elixir is working already. - I think you're right. Look.
