She eats like a sparrow and she swells right up. Sandra's mum? Yeah, yeah she lives in them renovated council blocks, opposite the sewage works. Where all the Pakistan's live. Council flogged them mostly to Pakistani's. Mind you, they've got the dosh. Anyway, Sandra's mum has got thick ankles from glands because she retains water. Don't be so unfair Derek, it not her fault. Heat gets to her. She's got fluid retention. Well, I mean, when she had Tony, she didn't half swell up. I mean, she really swelled. I thought she was gonna have fucking quins. Yeah, blew right up she did. It's like Sandra's mum. She retains water. Yeah, blimey she got big. I tell ya. Fluid. So after pregnancy the works gets all mucked up. It's like they, they don't restore themselves. Oh shit. What do you think? I like it. Yeah, it's much better than the youth clubs near us.

You in't half come out with, fuck me, she just made that up Del. Don't be an ignorant bastard at all your life, Dave. I know it's based on the Taj Mahal cuz I read it. Some prince went over to India and he fancied it so much he built one 'ere. I've always wanted to go India. Oh, no fucking way. Too many fucking Paki's. I know it's historic. I know that. Your misses, she knows a fucking thing or two, don't she? Ain't no flies on her. Yeah. But if his nibs ain't clocked it, he thinks it don't exist. Don't you doll. And anyway Del, I think you'll find there are no Pakistani's in India. Oh, so Derek's stupid in all, is he? I never said you were stupid Dave. Could've fooled me. I mean, how long does it take to get a packet of fags? Why don't you go and get us another couple of cream cakes? Yeah I wouldn't mind another cuppa actually. Hark at you, miss bossy boots, now what'd your last slave die of? I'm just saying. Go on Dave, you go get it. I'll have a tea. What'd you want? Oh, just a cream cake. Maybe a couple of sandwiches. Oh, and a chocolate roll. Well you heard her Dave, go on. So what's the plan then? Dunno, we're going dancing? Well hopefully if old, bloody, what's her name? Doreen? Doreen If Doreen gets back. Oh she won't be long. She's only getting some fags. I hate you. You left me. For nothing. It was all for nothing. I hate you. I dunno what this bleeding country's coming to. Poofs everywhere. Dog and duck this morning, there was hundreds of them. And I don't remember it used to be like that years ago. There's a lot of it about now Del. You know what they say? Keep your back against the wall. I mean, you know, you see 'em now and again, sitting in a corner, quiet, like you know, maybe a bit of mascara. It weren't bothering no one. Oh live and let live. That's what I say. Anyway they can't help it, it's their hormones. They've got female hormones. They think they're birds. They can't help it. It's nature's way. If you've got female hormones, you fancy fellas. No way Dor. They ain't all got hormones, you know some of 'em become poofs, it's like they're corrupted. No, no, no. I'm telling ya it's hormones. Some scientist did a test and he says, it's too many female hormones. Here, Sandra's mum she works for a couple of gays, who've got a sandwich shop in Dalston. You know, bit of cleaning and washing like, and she reckons they're the nicest couple you could hope to meet. Clean and keep a beautiful flat, wonderful cooks. She says they're every so funny. Well, you know, I don't say they're all bad. Do I? See? He didn't say nothing bad Doreen. He ain't prejudice, they can't help it. Fuck all that prejudice, right? I got nothing against them. Leaves more crumpet for us, ay Dave? Can't be bad, hey? Fucking nice one Del. As long as they keep away from me. Hey, you better not bend over hey Del? Yeah well, they'll find there's gold between them there hills I tell ya. Oh, that's gross Del. That's put me right off my beer that has. Well, trust me, mate. They won't get close enough to find out. You're right out of order, you are. Talking like that. You've got no respect you haven't. Not for no one. Look what I'm saying is they better not get near me. All right? That's all I'm saying. What? You think there's such sex maniacs that they wanna get near to you. They've got standards like everyone else. They're not that desperate. Here, they'd stick it in anything right? They can't help it, they'd stick it in a fucking tree. Bit much Del. Mind you, he's got a point there Doreen. I mean look the dog and duck this morning right? Me and Di we been going in there for years and they used to have wine by the bottle. They take 'em out and they dust 'em down. You know? And not just your red or your white Sweet or your dry. I mean, that was a really great wine bar, like with a wine list as long as your arm. And there'd be a pianist there tinkling on the old Joanna. Right? Not some numpty going down on a mic, right? No, like a real instrumentalist. Oh, grow up Derek. Well, you know what I'm saying? Nah, things have changed, times have changed. Yeah well you know what? Maybe they've changed too much. What about us, hey? You know where we supposed to go? Hey, I mean, we used love going in that gaff. You sit there with your brew, you know, sit outside. There'd be a couple of old biddies there having a tipple of sherry. You could have a laugh with, it was a proper old sherry house. I used to like going into them places in all it had a proper atmos. Yeah, right. You know, big old barrels up on the wall. Great big fat old barrels. Like your Di. Hey, hey, watch your mouth mate. That was right out of order. No, that was out of order, Dave. Sorry I took the right fucking diabolical liberty there. Yeah, you did. Thanks Dor. No, that was definitely out of order. I was joking. Del knows I wouldn't pull a stroke. Your Dor knows my Di can't help it, right? And it ain't right. Extracting urine out of them that can't help it. Excuse me. Where is the nearest? Shush, shush, shush. Where's the nearest takeaway? I need four burgers I don't want that. What's the matter with ya? Fuck off, go on now. 'Ere leave me alone. Ignorant bastards. I'll go and get some more cans, shall I? No need, you got the last six. No, no, no. I was out of order there I was. It's down to me. Yeah. Well, whatever you do, don't go to the dog and duck. Right? It's full of gingers in there. You two are such prats. I'm just glad they've got somewhere to go. Look I'm just warning him, that's all. Alright? You know, I ain't prejudice, I ain't. Right? We got some Paki's down our street. Sweet as a nut. Little corner shop, they bought off the saucepan lids Right? You run out of fags, you run in there. Milk, bread, butter, tea, news of the world, bacon. We got a Paki shop down our way. Get anything in there. Tomatoes, eggs, frozen TV dinners, chicken chop suey. Frozen of course. Beans. Oh, they do that Heinz vegetable salad, what you like. Dave really likes that. I do, I must confess I don't half go a bundle on that Heinz vegetable salad. Oh, he loves it. He can't get enough. We have to get 'em to order more tins in. He can't half get through it. You won't have the news of the world in the house, will you love? You're joking? No I swear. News of the world? Hey, you're having me on. That's a good read that is that's all right. That's exactly what I keep telling her. It's very suggestive Derek, its a bit candid. Yeah that's what Di says, right? You know what I say? Tells you what happens in the world, alright? It's only the truth, it's what people get up to. But Di she says it's sexist. Ah, what's solid sexist. Everything's sexist nowadays, in't it? Yeah, you know what's going on, don't ya? Your daughter, she's gone and gotten involved with some bint at work that's turning her on to being a feminist. Di told me. That bint happens to be a friend of mine. Alright. I'm a sexist, you're a feminist. She won't have anything sexist in the house neither. And she's always shouting at men on the television. Drives me up the fucking wall. Don't worry Dor it's just a phase you're going through darling. You two are such twats. Dn't half feel for Di, she in't half struggling at the moment with her knees and everything. And I know it's her glands, but she's so hot all the time, it must be awful for her. I mean, even if she took her cardi off, it might help a bit. Oh you're joking in't ya? You know her, hey? I mean show flesh? With all her hangups? I mean, she hates looking at them fucking girls in page three. She can't stand it, they got their tits out. You know me? I don't mind, right? I mean, you know, God made women, didn't he? Aye. So why should they be upset about showing a bit of what they've got? He must have been working overtime when he made Di. No, no, he was pissed as a newt, he said, let's have a giggle. You men can be very cruel. I was joking. No that woman has given birth three times. What are you bloody men good for? Dor do me a favor will ya? I slaved my bollocks off for 30 years on that assembly line in Ford, all she'd done was sit around on her fat arse watching reality television or video she forgot to tape back, right? The firring finds it was the last time, and actually all she ever done was whip her titty out now and again so the nipper could have a nosh. So don't go getting your nickers in a twist over her terrible life. I'd swap in a fucking heartbeat. He works like a dog Del. My dad used to take me down the library. That was our telly then we'd sit and read. Oh and if he was late back with your books, you got fined tuppence a day. It's all changed now, in't it? Nah, sod reality TV and videos. DVDs, terrific. I mean, the advances are unbelievable. I mean like years ago it was only the movie stars that could watch home movies, weren't it? I mean, you'd hear about some, sodding poncy movie star watching a movie in his front room. While I'd be out queuing in the rain for the one-a-nights. I remember when I was a kid queuing with my mum for yonks. We missed the first show, had to stay in the queue for the next session. I think Di has gone to kill him cows, right? I'm gonna go and see if I can find her. Remember when we used to go to the Roxy picture house? We used to drink that pissy orange muck. It was always warm and we'd be suckin' the last drops out. The whole cinema sounded like sodding croakin' frogs. We used to snuggle a lot in them days. Things we used to get up to in the dark back then. Don't be a dirty bastard. I mean with you, you daft mare. Didn't half pull some stunts in the dark. Don't embarrass me Dave. Oh, for fuck's sake Dor. You got no humour anymore.

Yeah, whatever. All right don't do us any fucking favors. Remember we used to go there after we'd had our swim. Oh yeah. Yeah, I love a curry after a swim. Yeah, mind you don't half make you run in the morning. They say, if you're constipated, it's best thing you can eat. Better than all them pills. Just an hot curry. Or you can order extra hot, dn't half make your eyes water, but I like really hot. Yeah, yeah We'll go and see the dolphins, d'you remember hey? Cor blimey they're smarter than most humans, I know right. Fucking amazing the capers they get up to. I think it's cruel. Ah, they're happy as larks swimming around, smiling their heads off, doing tricks. They couldn't do 'em if they was pissed off would they? They'd be sulking. Don't you think they missed their ocean home? We could go to that Indian after for old time's sake. Yeah, after. Not now. Lets go down the pier, like, you know we'll play the slot machines and then we'll have a little walk along to Rottingdean, right? That's too far. Well, all right. Look, you know, it's only a couple of miles. We'll have a slow canter. I can't, it's too far for my ankles. Well, alright darling. Look, we're walk slow alright? And you can work up an appetite for your old biriyani. It's my ankles. Leave her Derek, she can't walk so leave her. We'll take a short walk along the pier. But it's only a short pier. Well that's all right, fresh air, short walk, bit of a natter, you can go in that arcade and kill a few of your Nazi mates. You like that? Oh, ta. Eh, look I used to love our walk along to Rotters under the cliff and hear the old seagulls screaming their heads off, hey? Watch the sunset. Fucking handsome it was watch the boats. I can't, my fucking ankles hurt. I know, I know, I know, I'm just saying it's nice, alright? I know your fucking ankles hurt. Oh shit. Bet you didn't expect to run into us, you grease monkey. Not from round 'ere, are ya? Got a name then? Piss off. You what? You heard me, piss off. Get off me. I said get off me. Shit. Come on boys. Is that all you got, huh? Shit. Oh hey. Wait, wait here. What happened? Take, take. Thanks. Shall I call an ambulance? Nah, nah. Would you like a beverage? A fag please. Ta. How's my nose look, alright? Yeah, you are fine. Ah. You scrub up well. Do I? Let me just, put your head back. What are ya? Huh? Please, relax. What you playing at? Huh? Please. Piss off. No please do not leave. See all the darkies down on the beach. Brighton, the Caribbean of England. Well, yeah, it's funny. They're all lying there like that. They can't be trying to get a tan. Di you are dozy. Hey, they like to eat, they like the sun, right? Originally they come from a sunny place. So like they're drawn to the old current bun. Oh, they're a lovely family. Look at 'em all together. It's cheaper, in't it get 'em all in one motor. Oh Dave, do you have to be like that? No look that dad's being really sweet with his little girl. Oh Dave, in't it half lovely. Here, what did you do with them fags you got me? Oh, bugger. Oh, do you know what? You can be such a useless flaming git sometimes. I asked you to do one thing. Give me a break, I had all the cans to get. It ain't the crime of the century. I'll nip down and get 'em now. One lousy thing. Alright, you keep on, you can get 'em yourself. If you are going now, would you get us a packet of fags? You need the money now or you alright till we get back? No I'm alright. Oh, could just murder a nice little bit of chocolate. Just got a fancy for it right now. Suddenly got a yen. Chocolate, fags, fags. Do you want anything else? Oh if you can manage it, I'll have packet of crisps. Cheese and onion or salt and vinegar? Prawn cocktail, ta. Prawn cocktail, right. Fuck me, they've only got a nude beach here where they go with their dicks hanging out. Really? Yeah straight up, I kid you fucking not. A nude beach for men. I like nudity. I mean, I don't think there's nothing wrong with it. It's gotta be men and women though. Yeah, well, you know if you're normal, it's all right. In't it, hey? I mean, it's the most natural thing in the world. We was born without nickers weren't we, hey? I mean, yeah, I'll go for that. As long as the birds have got a nice pair of Bristols. Oh shut up, gutter mouth. See. See what? You don't like exposure, do ya? You think it's rude. Not rude, not rude. Jerk head. It's embarrassing. Just an excuse for you to look at us and laugh. I don't think anyone should be ashamed of showin' their body. And Di I keep telling ya, no one's laughing at ya. But Derek, I think you'll find it's 2005. So when men are using nudity to sell shit newspapers to wankers like you, it's no better than whorein'. I mean, I know they can say that they're broad minded and all that bollocks, but at the end of the day, they're no better than pimps putting birds on the game. Oh, sorry. Sorry, yeah. I didn't mean to bring that up. As the actress said to the bishop. I must say Doreen. I've never thought about it like that before. That makes sense, I must say. It's soft porn. We should get Del on page three. Yeah. I should fucking coco, in your fucking dreams. He'll know what it's like to have people ogling and laughing at ya. Oh, you're not still going on about this morning are ya? What this morning? Di in that pub this morning, with all them gays laughing at her. I just can't get outta my mind. They fucking hated me. Ah, no, not necessarily. You know, they might be poofters but don't mean to say they hate women, you know, just don't wanna get near 'em. I have to say looking around here, don't entirely blame them. Oh, well maybe you've got a touch of the iron yourself, hey? Oh, iron hoof, me? You gotta be joking, my old fucking sweetheart. Amazing, in't it hey? Whenever you don't wanna swing a leg over, you get accused of being a poof. I can't help my fat, I hate it. Oh, it's fluid retention, darling. Don't matter what you call it. I'm a fat, wobbling, lump. It's medical, it'll go. It will darling, it will. Mind you, you know, you don't half put it away. You do, you know? I fucking eat less than you do. It's just cause you're always watching me. You and your snide remarks. Yeah, well I'm just trying to fucking encourage you to diet. You was gonna have a whole fucking cheeseburger. I had the plain burger and gawd knows how many largers. You and Dave have put away. Can hear you fucking lot right under the pier. Right? Chocolates. Fags. Cheers mate. Fags. Cheese and onion crisps. They never had no prawn cocktail. Oh. So do you wanna have a go and look at the pavilion? Nah, I've fucking seen it already. It's poxy and it costs a fucking bomb. What do you wanna do? Fuck all. Let's go on the fucking bumper cars. Oh yeah, that's about right. You two are a pair of overgrown kids. All right, here. Di do you wanna squeeze on a fucking bumper car with me, hey? Hey? Hey, look, darling. Come on. I'll take you as you are doll for better or for worse, hey? Come on you old boot, you know, I love you ya. Do ya? Of course I do. Fuck all them others on page three. You're the one I love, hey? You're the fucking one for me babe. Hey, so don't go getting those silly fucking ideas. Cause you're my mate. You know that don't ya? Give us a chocolate. You're pissed. No I'm not, fucking not at all. I'm fucking certainly not bronze. I've only had four or maybe five. I'm fucking sober as a judge. Probably soberer. And anyway, you know what? I don't give a fucking monkeys what size you are darling. Cuz there's more of you to cuddle, right? You're pissed. I'm not, I promise ya. I swear, I'm not. Do you mean it, really? I mean it really, I could have killed them two in the fucking boozer this morning. Glad you didn't. I'm dreaming dreams. Oh no. Not that. Oh, here we go. I'm scheming schemes. I'm building castles high. Come on, I'm in the mood. They're born anew, their days are few. Just like a sweet butterfly. Oh I don't have any choice. And as the daylight is dawning, they come again in the morning. Here you are love. Come on you two, let's have a dance. Come on, everyone join in. Come on. I forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air. They fly so high, nearly reach the sky. Then like my dreams they fade and die. Fortune's always hiding, I've looked everywhere. I'm forever blowing bubbles, pretty bubbles in the air. What's wrong? I tread on your foot or something? No, I just can't. Thank you very much. Fuck me, that's enough exercise for one day. Oh shit, I'm hot. Woo. You alright? I dunno. Hey, I dunno. Oh yeah, bit of a giggle. Bit of a dance. Come on lets go on them fucking bumpers. Yeah. Hey ain't you gonna clear that lot up?

Oh I'd rather go and see the dolphins. Can't we do that? Here you are. You go with Di to see the dolphins, we'll go on the bumper cars and meet you back here in an hour. Yeah one hour, alright? Same place, an hour. Alright, we heard ya. One hour. Ish. Yeah. Don't wanna hear there's any temptation going on. Ah well, depends if anything tempting comes along. Yeah. All right sweetheart? Look at that Dave. The benefits of Brighton, aye? All right girls? Perverts. Oh, I'm not gonna do this again in a hurry. You'll be alright. I don't remember it being this steep. Well, we've got a bit older ain't we? Yeah. Look round the corner. Yeah was this corner. Oh yeah used to be. No it was definitely here. Oh God my feet. The whole things gone. Fucking hell. Oh fuck. Even the fucking dolphins aren't safe. Oh, sod it we might as well go back to the pool. We could have a nice little bit of candy floss and a cup tea or something. Do you know what Di, I've got bit of an headache. I think I'm gonna find a chemist. Get an aspirin, you go. You alright? I thought you like dancing. Yeah, yeah, no, I'm alright. Yeah I'm okay. I'd come with your Dor but it's all this walking. No, it's alright. I'll see you later Di. Alright, ta-ra. Sorry Dor. It's the only place I can find any kind of peace. Sorry to intrude. It's a free country. Is it very recent? The loss. Was 50 years ago today. Feels like yesterday. Was it here? What happened? Sorry, do you mind me? It was me and my dad. We was here, we was feeding the birds. It was our favorite place after me mum had died. Suddenly he said, don't move. Stay there. Promised me he'd never leave me. He, he left me. He was gone. And the little girl, she was gone. Little girl? Oh yeah, her kite got stuck, they said that she was trying to find it or something and, she drowned. And your dad, your dad saved the little girl? If only. Oh, are you alright? Can I do anything? Can I get someone, or? Darling stay here. Don't move. Okay. Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? Ted, for goodness sake. You do have to move you know? You are not hitting it right. Oh. This isn't what I had in mind, when you said we could spend the day together. Ted No Tom you must speak English, if you want me to get a job. Do you think we'll ever be able to be that happy and carefree? It must be so beautiful to be so at ease. I hate Brighton on a weekend. Every yob and his sister comes down. Ay, miserable bastards. All they want to do is get pissed and have a fight. It's horrible. Look at it. It's disgusting with all these empty beer cans, the dirty bastards wouldn't even put them in bins. What the bleedin' hells going on down there? What do they think they're doing? Oi, oi. Down where? You gotta be fucking kidding me. What? That's the pair of fucking nonces who was laughing at fucking Di in the boozer this morning. Did nobody tell you I was alright? Well, I asked and asked, but no one at the home gave a toss or, I don't know, maybe they didn't know. If I had just stayed with my mum and dad, not gone chasing that stupid kite. Your dad. He didn't die in vain, Doreen. He saved my life. And now here we are. Who'd have thought it? Do you remember what happened? I remember feeling weightless, floating, drifting away. Like a mermaid to live at the bottom of the sea. And then I couldn't breathe. And then someone was dragging me back to the surface, telling me what a brave little girl I was. That was your dad. He lifted me up onto a girder under the pier. So I was safe. Then there was a big wave. Big wave. And when it was gone, your dad was gone too. A life for a life. I thought my dad had deserted me. But he was a hero. Excuse me, you're blocking my sun. You're sitting on our chairs. Your chairs? So you are the slobs who left that disgusting mess behind? Here that Del? We're a couple of slobs. Yeah. Yeah. Pair of fucking poofs like you, calling us slobs, hey? You spent all fucking morning laughing and taking the piss out of my old lady. And then to cap it off you call us slobs. We were doing what? We don't even know your wife. Course you don't. And I suppose you weren't in the dog and dick this morning, were ya? Laughing your fucking asses off at her. We wouldn't do that. Oh, well you weren't in the dog and dick this morning? The dog and duck. Yes we were. But we weren't laughing. You hate women, don't ya? You think they're funny? You think my woman's a right gas, don't ya? You think his wife's a joke? Look, we haven't done anything, okay? What are we supposed to have done? Laugh. You was having a right laugh, weren't you hey? Because she suffers from what you might call, a generous form. Go on have some fucking guts in a minute, and we won't fucking hurt ya. Say you're sorry, you was out of order and you won't do it again. I swear I've never seen you or your wife before. I don't know what you're talking about.

Will be a bit painful down there. Might muck his love life up for a couple of days. Come on. Del when you kicked him, half the fucking beach looked up. And then you kicked him again. Everybody saw it. I lost me fucking rag mate. You must've kicked him vicious though Del. He looked white. Look he's alright. You know? And I fucking done it for you, didn't I? Hey? I mean, you know, it's nothing. Someone else could have put him in a fucking hospital. There was no need to put the boot in, he could do you for assault. Yes look, where's the age of fucking chivalry, hey? You know, he insulted me cuz he insulted my fucking woman. So I booted the twat, alright? That's it. Game over, finished. Oh, come here.
