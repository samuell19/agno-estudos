I think it really bears repeating... The secret of great food is never questioning just how great youcan make it. Isn't that right, Anna? Yes, Chef. So... come... sit with me, and enjoy the taste of Sayulita. I love that you're two seasons in... A season and a half, Hope. And you're still taking pictures. I'm like... the extra who finally got a line and is really grateful, and a little bit incredulous. Please, you earned your spot, and clearly, Dean likes you enough to keep you on. Okay, don't jinx me. Millie was here for three seasons and he fired her for... adding more salt. Well, just keep doing what you're doing. You'll be fine. Speaking of which, I pulled some of Dean's favorite recipes from Portugal, and... little somethin' extra. Ooh! Lavender rack of lamb? Mm-hmm. It's their most appreciated meat. Sounds delicious, but you know how he likes his own creations. Don't be a Millie. Oh, I wouldn't dare. Good. Okay, so I just finished this beauty. Let me guess... Two weeks, broken down by the hour? Half-hour. Oh, well, let's cross our fingers that... Don't even say it. Desculpe-me... Onde estao os banheiros? I'm pretty sure you know where the bathrooms are now, Russ. Okay, well, that confirms it. My pronunciation is amazing. Mais ou menos. That's Portuguese for "I agree," right? Sure. Where's Dean? Shouldn't we be heading to the airport soon? Uh, the vans will be here in an hour. Um... he's gonna meet us there. Where? The airport? Portugal. - Why? - Okay. His contract negotiations are just taking a little longer than expected. Stop. You know how these things go with him. Ahem. - So I've heard. - Not from me. We're about to start shooting our seventh season. Dean's just... throwing his weight around, playing hardball, seeing how much he can squeeze out of the network before he signs on the dotted line. Are they squeezable? Not for you and me. The deal will be sewn up by the time we land. We will get there. We always do. Right? I'll load up the camera. Did you connect with the farmer's market guy I found? Lucas is expecting your call. Uh, yes, we're playing phone tag. Then you're "it". Try again. We need vegetables, not variables. Ola. Ola. Hi, Lucas. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!! Oh. May I speak to Lucas, please? Sim. Hi. Are you talking to me? - Sim. - Oh. Is this Dean's assistant? Prep cook, but, yes, I'm Anna. Oh, hi, Anna. We are excited to welcome you to Lisbon. Oh, thank you. I just had a few recipes I wanted to go over and make sure you had all the ingredients. I'm sorry, is this a bad time? Apologize. Friday mornings are always... um, what's the word? Manic! Rest assured, you will be well taken care of. Just email me the list of ingredients, and I'll meet you here, whenever is best. All right... Hello? I'm assuming you know her? Hi, Mom. Give me a smile. Oh! Oh... You know, I love seeing you, Mom, but you don't have to come all the way down here every time I leave. Are you kidding me? I love it. It only took me, like, two hours. Besides, all our friends love all the behind-the-scene pics. So... where's Russ? Working. Why? Oh, just always nice to see him. Besides, your dad still thinks that maybe you two might... I already tried that door, Mom. It's closed. We're just friends. Okay. Okay. But we're glad that you'll be together 'cause Lisbon's a bit far for our liking... but exciting! Yes, very. I wish you guys could come. It's gonna be a smidge more glamorous than this. Mm, don't worry about us. I just wanted to see your face. Your dad did, too, but the city's paying him double-time to get Main Street's power back up. He sends you love. What'd you do? Mm, nothing. It's just a little travel kit. Type-E adapters... converters. I also put a little melatonin in there, and a jar of peanut butter, in case you need it for a recipe or feel a bit homesick. I hear it's hard to find over there. That's very considerate. Thank you. Of course, sweetheart. We just want you to be prepared for any situation. It's not like the diner. It's Hollywood. It's not exactly Hollywood, but I know what you mean, and I'm going to keep my head down and stay clear of the drama. Especially since that boss of yours sounds like a bit of a... Mom! Well, what I mean is... good luck, honey, mm? And call us if you need anything, all right? - Okay. - Have the best time! - I will. - Oh! I will, I promise. I can't believe we're working here. This is stunning! It's Dean. What did you expect? - Hope! - Yeah? Can you share the WiFi password with me? Oh, man, I'm starving. You reckon they're serving lunch yet? How come you didn't eat on the plane? The chicken wasn't that bad. Oh, I couldn't. The olives were touching it. You're joking, right? Olives are evil. Oh, come on! Uh, let me guess... Dean's already here and the villa's complimentary gift basket is too small? No. Yeah. What? No. It's... It's fine. Nothing to worry about. That doesn't sound good. No, it doesn't. Oh! I told Lucas I'd meet him by noon. Yeah, no worries. Go for it. I'll, um, I'll make sure you get a good room. Eh, no, no, no. What...? Um... Oh, uh, sorry, I... My-My Portuguese is only... Ah, okay. This is not an entrance. Says "delivery only." Are you delivering something? Oh, no, I'm... I'm meeting someone. The manager? Whatever you call the person that runs the market in Portuguese... Lucas. Yes! Yes, Lucas. So you must be Anna? - Yes! - Very nice to meet you. Hi. Oh, hi! Where's all of your crew? Oh, they're back at the villa, settling in. I thought you'd be filming this. No, no. Our show's about fine dining, so we don't leave the kitchen unless the chef makes an exception. Our guests come to us. Okay, but the market is the heart of Portuguese cooking. Yes, I agree. I agree, which is why I'm here, to get the freshest produce possible. Well, the market is the best in Portugal, but it's only a sample of our exquisite cuisine. All right. I would love to see inside. Sure. Let your tour begin. You need help? ♪ Eu já tenho o que fazer ♪ ♪ Quarta-feira ♪ ♪ Recomeço a correr ♪ ♪ Quinta-feira ♪ ♪ Desta vez é que vai ser ♪ ♪ Sexta-feira ♪ ♪ É pena, sexta não dá ♪ ♪ Sábado à noite há cachupa ♪ ♪ E domingo, pois, lá está ♪ ♪ A família toda junta ♪ ♪ Feijoada ♪ ♪ Deus me acuda ♪ ♪ Vou correr, vou... ♪ ♪ Na segunda... ♪ Say "cheese"! Cheese! ♪ ...Vão ver ♪ They are super-fresh. Mm-hmm. Obrigada, senhor. So? Exceptional! Exceptional and very reasonable. I told you... We are a paradise for oyster lovers. Too bad Dean isn't here. I find the market can... inspire chefs, you know? Yes. Yes. Chef prefers that the cooking be more scripted and the conversation more spontaneous... not the other way around. But he does use the best locally-sourced ingredients... The freshest. And so he sends his prep cook? Yeah! I love this part... Seeing all the colors and smelling the aromas. Well, we work closely with our top farmers to secure the best of everything. Do you want to taste some bread, maybe? Do I? This one is our typical... Carcaça. - Carcaça. - Yeah. I love it here already. Nice. - Mm! - Very good. But phone cameras are just as... Oh. Hi. Hey, you're back. Yes, after a very fruitful tour from SenhorLucas, who seems to know where to find the best of everything. Everything? That's a... that's a bold statement. Yeah. Portuguese is a romance language, so "bold" translates to "beautiful". Oh, you're back. Great. Here you go. Change of plans. Uh... Dean is back? Not yet. Do we know when? Couple of days, at least, so, for now, we're going to stay on schedule. How? Wait for it. We've got you. Me? Mm-hmm. Well, I'm... Well, I'm not a host, so... Oh, I know that. This is just a-a temporary workaround. You'll still do all your prep work, make sure you got everything ready to go for the episode. And then? Then we're just going to shoot all the B-roll... All the extra side packages and interviews with you instead of Dean. Don't worry, when he gets back, we'll just splice him in and it won't all be you. How does that part work? I don't know yet, but it has to. Okay. Okay, so basically, I'll do both jobs, but really, I'm... I'm covering for Dean? Temporarily. I-If I can't? Uh, they shut us down, we fly back home, and no one gets paid. No pressure. Oh, sorry, I got to, uh, take this. Will you come with me? Uh, wait. How can his voicemail be full? I need a large glass to fill. Super Bock or Sagres? What's your choice? Uh... Super Bock... The unofficial beer of Portugal. You realize this is a terrible idea, right? What, drinking beer? No. Me covering for Dean, even if it is just temporary. Why? You do most of the work anyway. Yeah, the prep work, not the filming and interviewing. People want Dean. That's a generous statement. On TV. You know what I mean. He's the... personality. You got a great personality. What? You do. And it's not like it's the first time you put yourself out there. Okay. If you're referring to me trying to kiss you after the wrap party... "A," that was a long time ago... Well, a year-ish. And "B," I thought you were being very flirty. Oh, I was. I'm Australian. Right. I got that now. "C"... you turned me down. Uh, no... Cherished our friendship. And now look at us... best mates. Best mates, but I think you could have found a better example. Actually, I was talking about the day Millie got fired. Oh, right. That. Yeah, "that". You said you started as a waitress in high school, but by the time we got to the restaurant, you were head chef. "Chef" is a stretch for a family-owned diner. Okay, but it caught the attention of a two-star Michelin chef, who thought it would be fun to shoot there. You could've just filled in for the episode, but when Dean asked if you wanted the job, you took it. This is different. No, it's not. The show needs you, just like it did then. Won't he be mad? He fired Millie for adjusting one of his recipes, and she went to the Culinary Institute of America. What's he gonna do to a short-order cook who comes in and takes over his entire show? Don't sell yourself short. Besides, the network is asking you, so it's not like you got a choice. Remember, this is temporary. Someone will cave soon, so right now, we just need to stay afloat until Dean gets here. It's the best shot we got. Just don't screw it up. Thanks, mate. I feel so much more relaxed now. I'm kidding. Yeah, well, don't worry. I will, uh, I'll let you know how it goes. Good news! Our guest is still coming. He just confirmed, so we should all turn in and get some rest because, tomorrow... you're Dean. Temporarily. You ready for that... - Anna "Dean" Wells? - Yeah, no... That sounds like sausage. Yeah, maybe just "Anna". Okay, "Just Anna". You ready? Here we go. Come... sit with me and enjoy... the taste of Portugal. Come... Come, sit with me... Come, sit with me... What? Why are you looking at me like that? I don't think you need any more caffeine. Oh... it's only my third espresso. Your tapping is stressing me out! Sorry. I'm just a little nervous. Really? Yeah! You would be, too, if you were me. Or maybe not... but how? 'Cause. "'Cause." Not helpful, Brooklyn. 'Cause I know you guys need me. So... yeah, that. Yeah. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Maybe two was enough. Okay, "Just Anna", we're ready for you! That better not stick. I don't know... it's catchy! Okay. This is all just usual prep and setup. Only difference... You'll be interviewing our guest too, now, not Dean, because this is plan "C" or "F" or whatever plan it is we're on now. - You good? Okay. - So... So Duarte's restaurant here is one of Dean's favorites? - Mm-hmm. - But he's not a chef. No, he's just someone he's known for years and he'd be a great guest, so just follow the bullet points we gave you. Dean's guests are like him... Love to talk about themselves, so that should give you plenty of time to prep, and remember, it's just all about the banter. Okay? - All right. - Have fun. - Totally. - Just don't go out of frame. You can't exit to retrieve ingredients now. Remember to always smile. The camera is never not on you. Maintain control of the conversations. You are the one leading the discussion. Okay? Anything else? Yeah, could we get a little touch-up in here? Oh, again? - Just for those close-ups. - Uh, how close are we talking? Don't worry, I got you. Let's talk about those angles that we want. Uh, my angles or the kitchen's? They were talking about mine, weren't they? Okay. For me, it starts at the market. Yes, there are recipes, ahem, but once you get there and you see and taste everything... What's in season... It changes things. Don't you think? No, not for me. I leave it up to my chefs. Of, uh... Ray-Tasco? Re'Tasco. "Re'Tasco." - Yes. - Right. It might be my fourth restaurant, but it has something my others don't. Youth! My executive chef received his first Michelin star at 25. Dean introduced us. Have you met him? Dean? No. My chef. Um... Oh, um... no. Dean, um, Dean doesn't usually, um... You know, I think that, um... that is a perfect tomato. Has a lot of meat... not a lot of seeds, and it's, uh... Mm... Mm. Definitely not sweet enough. Would you like to put on an apron and help me plate the microgreens? Or not. Ahem, that's fine. Whatever you're... comfortable with. So you just opened your fourth restaurant? Wow! That must be really nice. The last review calls it "ambitious". Nice. Yes, and... "deliberately playful". Wow. Wow, that's really, um... "Nice"? Okay! Okay, yeah, w-we got it. Um... you're good. Uh, let's, um, let's... Let's take a break. Let me know when Dean's here. I will. Thank you. I don't know what that was, but that was not good. It's... Don't worry, it's fine. We'll get it. Okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Stop that. It's day one. You did... well. Just... ahem, tomorrow, try to own it a little more and, um, maybe less tomato talk. Really? Russ, let's go! Got to go get those exteriors before we lose the light. You okay? Totally, yeah. Go. Go! You sure? Yes, please. Please go. Wow. You know what this reminds me of? High school. I'm having a hard time finding that connection. You were so afraid to try out for dance team, worried that you'd fail every time, and you never did. I got lucky. No! You worked hard. This is a whole different ball game. You have to know your stuff, entertain people. I feel like I was putting people to sleep. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself, and you can always come home. Mm. Dad was saying that the county's hiring, not till the end of the month, but it's always an option, and a lot more reliable. Thanks, Mom, but... I'm sure you're right. Probably went better than I thought. I just... just needed to vent, that's all. Of course, sweetheart, but just know that we're always here, if you need us. Thanks, Mom. Love you. Love you, too. Got a message? Leave it. Sorry. The voicemail box you're trying to reach is currently unable to accept messages. Okay, take that one. I don't need the lenses in that case. You can take that and this one. Thank you. This can go, too. Thank you. I'll be in touch. Please tell me that's not the last we'll see of them? Well... for a little while, maybe. Some of the other guests we had lined up won't commit unless Dean's here. So it's just gonna be a skeleton crew for a couple of days... Running around in Portugal, filming all the sights, getting B-roll, and no Dean, so he can't stop the shenanigans. Um, yeah. So, oh! And speaking of that... I'm taking everyone out tonight. First round's on Russ. I'm gonna skip it, if you don't mind. I'm feeling a little tired. Of course not. Well, rest up. Come... sit with me and enjoy... Is never questioning just how great you can make it. Isn't that right, Anna? Yes, Chef. So... come... Sit with me... Splice it or replace it? Splice, replace, it doesn't matter, it's not gonna work. The network saw the footage and they're nervous. - Like, pull-the-trigger nervous? - Mm-hmm. Hope, I think I have an idea. I'm not Dean. He can just sit in a room, sip wine, cook a little, chat a lot, and everyone loves it, but it's not me, and I'm not gonna pretend that it is, so we need to get out of the kitchen. Lucas. Hi. Ola! Bom dia. Uh, yes, bom dia. Hi. Welcome. Hey, mate. Thanks for letting us come on such short notice. Spontaneity is a necessary ingredient for creativity. Yes, exactly. Which is why, instead of shooting the sights, we thought we would come show where the food comes from. Yeah, sure! Let your tour begin. My market is the best in Portugal. It is! - Oh? - Yeah. It is? I want to see it. You will see. I'm excited for today. So this is a traditional Portuguese market, where we're going to be gathering all the ingredients that we need for our meals. We have the fruits, the vegetables, and most importantly, we're going to get the Portuguese spices that we need to make the traditional dishes, so come with me while we find them. I'm in tomato heaven right now. We have about seven or eight different varieties of tomatoes, and I'm a big fan, but these are very interesting to me because I don't see these a lot. What's... What's the name of these? Tomate azul. "Tomato azul." Aren't these beautiful? I'm wondering if the flesh is the same color inside, but only one way to find out... We're gonna have to cut her open. I'm taking lots of these with me today! We have the freshest, most stunning eggs from this beautiful couple's farm. Eggs are the foundation for so many dishes that we'll be making this week, so you always want to make sure you are fully stocked up on eggs. And something else that I heard this morning is his shirt says, "I sell boneless chicken," which I think is hysterical, but anyway, let's... let's keep moving! What you're gonna eat is actually the bottom portion of the leaves... The whiteness is the ripeness. And this is the famous Pastel de Nata... The culinary trademark of Portugal. Mm. Food and tradition all in one. We're gonna have to try to make these while we're here. Portugal is an endless wonder... If you know where to look. Okay! Uh, I think we got it. Oh, we... oh. You guys are very, very natural together. Great. Oh, it's so much easier out in the world, isn't it? And you make it easy. And you, with that "endless wonder" to bring it home. That was perfect, right? Okay, well, either way, I-it's working, so keep it up. - Yeah. - Thank you. Just let me know if you want to taste anything else or interview anyone else. Oh, thank you. I think we're good for today, but for tomorrow? Where are we getting the freshest fish? Not here. I thought they had the best of everything here. For cooking at home, yes, but if it were my restaurant or show, there's only one place I'd get the freshest of fish from. Pineapple is my favorite. The taste of Portugal is in every sip. Who'd like to try it? You? Yes, please. You? Okay? - In my opinion, the best. - Thanks. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Mm! It's good. - Obrigada. - You're welcome. If you don't want yours, - I'll have it. - Okay. Thank you. And, uh, just let me know when you're ready to discuss the important fishes, and I will introduce you to the fishmonger. Sounds like a plan. Okay. "Important fishes"? Ahem. Oh, don't worry. It's lost on me, too. Uh, yeah, I think it means he's trying to impress you. Really? Come on. I saw that look he gave you. There was a look? Well, how would you feel if there was? Honestly... I'm too freaked out right now to think about it. How many more two-day delays do you think they'll give us? Well, it depends on how long Dean wants to faff and how good today turns out. Mm. So, uh, it's kind of on you. You got this, right? Mm-hmm. What? Super-fresh is always best... right? Right. Right! Where are you going? - Lucas? - Yes? Quickly... Do you happen to know anyone with a boat with a kitchen on it that we could use, maybe tomorrow? Tomorrow? You want to... You want to cook on a boat? Just until Dean gets back. Doesn't get much fresher than that. Have you... Have you run it past Hope? Ah, not yet. I just, I wanted to see if it was even possible first. Yeah, it is tight. But creatively spontaneous? For you... I'll find one. Great. Thank you. Thanks. Awesome! Can I ask you something? Always. What'd you think of today's footage? Well, for someone who loves cooking, you're really trying to avoid that kitchen, aren't you? I'm trying to avoid all of us being out of a job, honestly. Touche. Better? Do you really need to ask? Sure do. Just did. You're captivating. Stop it. No, I'm serious. I feel like you are more "you" than you've ever been. That's high praise coming from you. I just hope the network approves of the changes. I think they'll approve anything that buys us time and looks good. Even the boat? Do we even know if we have one yet? Lucas seems confident. You can say that again. - And he's very helpful. - Mm-hmm. Oh... we are so doing this. Doing what, dancing? Yes! It would be rude not to. It's part of the experience. Yeah, I'm... I'm really not a great dancer. Oh, you're Australian. They love everything Australians do here. Oh, yeah? Including this beauty? Maybe not that one. Wow. Where'd you learn that move? YouTube. I, um, I almost did this documentary on Latin dancing. You did? When? How come I didn't know about that? Well, it was right before I did this much-needed paying gig. Would've been fun. Might have learned a move or two, but, um, I wouldn't have met you, or be here... doing this. So... Sorry. Lucas. Could be about the boat. Okay. Well, uh, tell your boyfriend I said hi. What are you, five? Ola. We were just talking about you. Hey! Não, não. Três. - Um... - Três. No more. Surely, we can get maybe, like, two or three more? No? Hope, I can just shoot it documentary style. There's plenty of natural light. And I could stay behind. You're welcome. Thank you, Brooklyn. Your sacrifice is noted. Okay, well, then I guess it's just me, Anna, and Russ and Tiago, of course. The rest of you can watch from here. I'm guessing we're going to want to come in and reset, so just keep watching and be ready. We go now. Oh. Okay. We-We go now. Great. - Good luck. - Um, okay, um... okay, let's get these supplies on the boat. Thank you! Anna... you ready for this? Yes. Let's cook some fish. Have fun out there. So once you get the garlic and onions all into a nice saute, those flavors sizzling in the pan... Ooh, it's not every day you get to cook on a boat! Fun fact, it's actually my first time on a boat, so... Let's add some more olive oil and then the fillet. Thank you. As fresh as can be! You okay? Uh... I just need a minute. She doesn't look good, but they're not coming in. Sea bass... is a bit of a chef's secret. It's dainty and delicious, and if you don't want to deal with all the skin and the bones, your butcher can do that for you. But I am here to show you that it's nothing to be scared of. Whoo! At least in the kitchen on land! Whoo... Uh-oh. Hey. You okay? Do we have any, uh... Have any ginger ale on board? Here. Okay? - It's okay. - Okay. You're doing so good. The trick... is to lift the bones out of the fish in one smooth and easy motion so that you don't disturb the presentation. Not bad. Not bad. A little more sauce and... this turned out perfectly! A very Portuguese lunch. Bon appetit. Let's cut! Cut. Whoo! Well done. Hey. I couldn't find any more ginger ale, but they should help. Oh. Thank you. I'm already feeling a bit better. Oh, good. So that was mortifying. No, no, I... kind of liked it. Oh. You liked watching me get motion sickness? I liked watching you handle it like a boss. Just, you know, getting out of your head and-and doing it. It was real cooking. It was fun. I don't know if "fun" is the word that I would use. Okay, not fun, but entertaining. It was certainly that, and very beautifully shot, I'm sure. Maybe, maybe. Thank you. Yeah, there was nowhere to hide. It was... it was intimidating. That is why it was so good. It was just you being you, and... you are pretty awesome. Same. Thanks. I was kind of worried about you for a second, though. Oh? Me too. Hey. Oh. What are you doing here? I... I thought you were stuck at the market all day. And I was, but I had to check in and see how it went. - Oh... - With the boats. Oh, yeah! Yeah, smooth sailing. It was that! It was very good, which is why we need to get back and put together the dailies so the execs have something to wake up to. Well, I'm ready. Are you? Uh, yeah. Oh, too bad. I was hoping we could go to dinner to toast your success and talk about... other locations. "Success" is a little premature, but that's very sweet. It never hurts to have some backup locations lined up. Hmm? Uh, I... I'd feel bad bailing. No, you should go. Enjoy. No, there's nothing left for you to do here, so... Okay, well, if you guys are sure? Go. Have fun. - Great. - Yeah, we'll see you back there. Okay. Are you ready for the best food in Portugal? I would expect nothing less at this point. Except maybe no more fish. Okay. Is it me, or do I detect a little love in Lisbon? Okay, I know you want it to be a surprise, but I am starving. Can you at least tell me if we're close? Almost there. Promise. - Okay. - Okay. First thing that comes to mind when you think of Portugal. Port. Specifically? Tawny, aged 20 years. My favorite. Yeah. And fish. Lots of fish. True, but not Ronaldo? - Who? - The football player. Not for the Bears. I'm clearly more into food than sports. Okay, then you're in for a treat. After you. I thought you would enjoy a truffle tasting. Who told you the way straight to my heart? Oh, my goodness, that's good. That's incredible. What an intoxicating whiff. One that I'm guessing will stay with you. Ever been to Alba, Italy, for the white truffle? No, I actually haven't traveled much outside of the show. Okay, so Portugal is a first? Yes. But you seem to know some Portuguese. My dad is Brazilian, but he didn't teach me. I can understand a little. Okay, makes sense. So where did you study the culinary arts? Wait, let me guess. Uh... Auguste Escoffier? No? Kendall? CIA? Lou's in Chicago. "Lou's in Chicago". Is that a small school? Yeah, tiny little hole in the wall. It's what some might call a "greasy spoon", and I call it a killer free education. "Dean in Chicago"... They ended up filming in my diner, and I ended up filling in when he fired his prep cook. That's certainly lucky for you. Yeah. Yeah, it's a bit like Cinderella with a crazy, erratic prince. The classic fairy tale. I think I would've gone to culinary school, but my mom got sick and I had to stay at the diner and work and help out until she got better. And I tried to get a job at some high-end restaurants, but nothing really panned out. Until Dean. I remember being so nervous making that decision to quit, go work for Dean. I ate like three bites of toast in the days after that, and I'm an eater. Well, food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so you should enjoy every mouthful. And I get it, it can be frightening, leaving the familiar. I'm considering starting my own venture. Venture? Really? Yeah. Restaurant. Different. - Oh, wow! - Yes. But just to say, I get how it felt. But how do you feel now? I felt overqualified there and under-qualified here. I know it was the right decision, I'm just not sure where I fit any longer. Maybe that's because you are on the edge of something great. I like that. Cheers. To something great. So he just walked away from negotiations, just like that? So what, you're just gonna try and find a... A new chef? Yeah, I mean, that makes sense, but just what about... what about everyone else? So we'll just finish out the last three and then we'll see? Okay. All right, well, you just keep me posted on who you find. Okay. I know you know I'm right behind you. New chef? That's not gonna be great for anyone. Well, at least we all still have jobs... today. Look, the network is still asking for the dailies. They really like the footage and the creative direction they're seeing. They're just trying to slide the new person in. So... how's that coming? Uploading now. Great. Thank you. How was your date? Oh! Don't scare me like that. Sorry. What are you doing out here? Are you... you waiting up for me? Maybe. Why? What's wrong? Come sit with me. He just bailed? Like, "no, thanks"? Wow. This is it. We don't know that for sure, but... all the signs point to yes. I shouldn't be surprised, but... I'm surprised. Ditto. We were just finding our groove. I know! I know. That footage today was a beaut. I knew it would be. You were great. Would you ever want to host? Like, be the chef? You're seriously asking me that? Well, they haven't hired a new chef yet, but they will soon. Why can't it be you? They'd never go for that. Why not? I'm not a celebrity. They've given you the chance of more airtime. They clearly think you're capable of more. Out of desperation. I have been performing well under pressure... and on rough waters. It's kind of now and ever. But, uh, they're not gonna ask you to host. That's it? That's your pep talk? You need to show them that you can be the main, the lead... because I already know you can make it great. Wecan make it great. If you figure out what you want to show 'em... I'll film it and edit it, for you, Chef. They bring their queijos to the market every Thursday and Sunday, and they are my absolute favorite, as is this town. Oh, wow. Thank you. Oh, this is exactly what I hoped for! I just want everyone to have fun... That's what these tastings are all about. Just experiencing the easy, natural magic that good food brings. Let's get set up. - Terceira. - Terceira. There's nowhere in Portugal you're gonna go that you won't find a block of this sitting around. We have two of the same cheese here... One is cured and one is not. As you can tell by the texture, this is the cured one. Thank you. - It's fantastic, right? - Wow! That's beautiful. Wow! Yes. This one. This one is my favorite. Yes. This is a phenomenal milk-blend cheese. It's goat and cows' milk. Amazing. Good food is for everyone! You have to try it. Okay. Okay. To Anna. Cheers. I don't know about you guys, but that felt so fresh to me. Entertaining and still informative, which we love. Yeah, very impressive. You told the story of this place so beautifully... almost as beautiful as you are. Stop it. Uh, thank you. That's very sweet. It was fun. Yeah, everyone had fun. So, uh, next up, olives. Um, an entire episode on a side dish? It's gonna be great. You'll see. Everything's lined up. Well, thank you. Okay. Uh, guys, no, we need to make sure those lights go in the van first, please. Uh... well, I think we can all be proud of our work today. Absolutely. And we're done. Right? Good. Then you should come with me. Where? To see more of the area. It's really growing. I have just a quick meeting with an investor. Oh, for your restaurant? Yeah. But it shouldn't take long, and I would love to show you around more. Oh. Um, maybe we... rain check for tomorrow? It's my day off. - It is? - Yeah. Oh, mine too. I'll take you to lunch. Okay. Perfect. Good. See you. Bye. Don't. I wasn't gonna say a thing. You lie. Come on. I need to go walk off that last cheese you made me eat. Me? I did not tell Brooklyn to bring you the plate of leftover Azeitão... You only have yourself to blame. No, 'cause I was behind the camera... You know, doing my job. It was you who insisted I joined the cheese party. Eh, fair. Thank you for this. Walking with nowhere to go, nowhere to be... it just feels magical, doesn't it? It's kind of my favorite thing. What, walking? Wandering. Winging it. Just, uh, you know, seeing where things go. Maybe that's why you're drawn to documentaries. Well, yeah, exactly. Um, there's a... There's a real opportunity for discovery in that genre that I find really exciting. I guess that's a dream. Well, I can't imagine there wouldn't be a lot of opportunities. Well, there were at first, but after you turn down a few, the offers stop coming. Anyway, according to my mates back home, I've already made it. So I am just trying not to screw up a good thing, I guess. I completely get it, but you've got to ignore your mates back home. How do you do that? What? Uh, what am I doing? I don't know. That! That thing you do when you... you look me in the eyes and... And then I'm like... Ginja? The best of Portugal. Best, best! The best? Oh, well, I guess we'd better try it then. If it's the best, we must. Cheers. Well, cheers. Do you just put it all in? I think it's sip and bite. Okay. Okay, that works. Yeah. Mm! Sick ride. This is incredible. Thank you. Look at this space! Wow. This is perfect. It is. Is... this is for our date? I hope you don't mind. I took the liberty of ordering. Uh, usually, yes, but this looks delicious. Thank you. You're welcome. Is this your first day off in Portugal? It is. Then I'm honored you're spending it with me. Oh. And I'm flattered that you wanted to show me where you're opening your restaurant. Yeah. Yeah! But it's not a fully day off. No way! You beat me here? How's that possible when I live two minutes down the road? You know me. Thanks for coming. Hugo, this is Anna. - Anna. - Hi. Very nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. You must be Dean's assistant? Prep cook. Oh, yes, sorry. Sorry. Hugo is a huge fan of Dean's. Help yourself. Which is why we are excited to have you do a segment here. Here? - Yeah. - Yeah. I just thought I help your show, so Dean can feature my restaurant when it opens. It's the least he can do, right? Is that what this is all about? There's potential for everyone. Absolutely. To promote your restaurant? - Mm-hmm. - We just need Dean. Well, I don't think he's coming anymore. What? I thought you said you were just filling in until he got here. He's not coming anymore. You said you had a day off. Things change. Well, this is all very, uh, disappointing. Wait, wait, wait. Anna, we can still get the crew here, right? Lucas, this show's not your golden ticket. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a day off to enjoy. This feels intense. Sorry. I didn't see you there. You know, you should really use your words. Violence isn't the answer. Take a seat. Lucas? How'd you guess? I'm... very empathetic. Yeah. I'm more annoyed than upset. I think I was more upset when Russ rejected me. At the wrap party? Right. I'm so glad you were there to witness that. Maybe that means something. Yeah, it means that I should stop looking at a good friend as anything more, even if in certain foreign environments, it feels like it could be something more, but it's only going to result in future humiliation. And Lucas... Everything feels transactional now. I hate that! Like, how do you know if someone likes you or what you can do for them? You don't. You just have to trust your gut. Oh, yeah, that led me right to an empty building. Well, maybe, but as soon as you knew, you knew, and you were out of there. I really thought he was interested in the food. Like we were connecting over it, and now everything just seems less real. No, the food is real. The viewers you connect with are real. Our friendship is real. Don't let one pompous idiot put you off. Most of us are still diner folks at heart. Oh. Brooklyn, I love this gooey side of you. Don't get used to it. Hey, you're back. I am. I was, uh, I was gonna head out and do some sightseeing. You guys want to join? No. Looks like it's just the two of us. Sure. Cheers. And so you think one person is one thing, and another person is another thing, and it turns out Brooklyn is just awesome. Right? I mean, Short Film Award in New York, completely made and edited on her phone, I mean... She's full of underrated surprises. Oh, for me, this whole trip is. I forgot to ask, how was your lunch date with Lucas? It wasn't a date. Mm-hmm. It wasn't. And I'm not giving it, or him, any more of my time. Good. You deserve way better. Well, you know, when the time is right, but right now, I just want to keep my head in the game, show the network what I can do. So the goal for tomorrow? Basic drama-free fun. That's what I want, so if we get canned tomorrow, we can go out happy. Ish. Ish... yeah. Okay, well, um... - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Bom dia, Portugal. Bom dia. Let's get it. I think the olive mill you found is way better than the one Lucas suggested. Oh, that was all Brooklyn. Yeah, she got on that as soon as Lucas sent my call to voicemail. Turns out he doesn't always pick the best of the best. Hmm. Right. So you're going to do an olive oil tasting? Yes. It's gonna be a whole olive experience, and I'm gonna finish with a green olive dip recipe I found. I'm down for some liquid gold. Aw, thanks, Brooklyn. Okay, it's time to roll. We have two days left to prove to whoever this new chef is that we are a team worth keeping. Right? Absolutely. Tch! And prove who the real chef is. No pressure. You got this. Thanks. Who's that? I have no idea. You don't think... ♪ Surprise! ♪ Did you miss me? I knew they'd cave eventually. I mean, it's not like they could just replace me, is it? I'm just surprised no one gave me a heads up. Ah, yes. Now, that was my idea. Hmm. Was it? Yeah. Well, you know me. I love a grand entrance. And, uh, I was, uh... sort of over the Algarve. You were in Portugal this whole time? Well, at least you're finally here. And with more creative control, starting now. Excuse me? Does that mean we won't be going to the olive mill? I should... I should let them know. Sorry, why would we be going to an olive mill? What am I gonna cook there? We do everything in the kitchen. We did. We had to change up the format a little, get out of the kitchen, get into the city, and outside of it, where everything was just a bit more relaxed... because you weren't here. Are you trying to say I'm not relaxed? No. Didn't say that. I needed to keep things interesting until we could splice you in, when you got back. So it was your idea? Yes. The network wanted us to stay on schedule. And she slid right on in! Again, keeping us on schedule in your absence. What'd you expect? Respect! Can I put your bags down? They're really heavy. Of course, you can put my bags down... In my room. You're welcome. So... where did you go on these little outings? We started at the market, then the coast. On a boat. Very picturesque. - Mm-hmm. - Also, a queijeiro. And it was all you? No. No, everyone pitched in. Oh. Well... since everyone seems to be embracing change around here, I'll introduce the next one, which is... getting rid of you. What? Wait, what? Dean... We have two more days left of shooting. You really want to do that? Oh, yes, I do. I'm the chef on this show. I know you prefer rose, but all they had was verde. When in Portugal... Why am I not more okay? That was brutal. Yeah, but... also inevitable. Was it? He swapped out sweet Millie mid-episode. True, but sweet Millie didn't even really want to be doing this. She didn't? No. She went back home to Columbus and opened her own restaurant, and is really happy. Oh... I'm so glad! Oh, that makes me so happy. Because you care. You care about your co-workers, you care about the audience, the work you do... and you love what you do. I love sharing food. Showing people technique... that it can be experimental and fun. Gourmet cooking is not just for students of the culinary arts. Food is so much more than that! It's... culture. It is caring. And connection. Which is exactly why you should be the one hosting. It was never about that for me. I didn't even know that was an option. Yeah, I know, but... that's what this gig is. Every job is a weird sign or a hard sign. As long as the other outweighs it, why wouldn't you go for it? Mm... because I was just fired? From Dean? He's one person. Everyone knows it's a volatile industry. There's way more out there. I don't think I'm cut out for this. You know what I think? That olives are evil? Yes! Olives are evil. And... you're a bloody ripper. A "ripper"? Ripper? I can't handle the Aussie slang on top of the Portuguese. It just means you're great. Really great. That's all. Stop it. You'll make me cry. Sorry. That's, uh, not my intention. And for the record, um... I messed up. I think we all did our best... considering the circumstances. I'm not talking about work. Your flight's all booked. A 3:45 p.m. departure tomorrow... one stop. That was fast. Sorry, I... I should probably go pack. Yeah. Yeah, of course. No worries. I'm just saying you didn't have to do that in front of everyone. She was out of line. She was saving your show! Are we gonna eat? You know, I've stood by you through a lot, but you put us in a really bad spot this time. Some things can't be helped, can they? Not true. You held the show hostage. And you know, this whole "bad-boy sheriff" act has gone way too far, if it's even an act anymore. I thought we were having dinner. I lost my appetite. Oh, but you should watch the footage... because Anna was good for the show. It's fine. It's fine, Mom, really. I mean... I got to go to Portugal and Mexico and... half of the major cities in America, so it's all good, and now, it's just... it's time to come home. You could call Lou, see if he needs help in the diner? No. I-I'm not sure I'm gonna do that. Have you filled in the employment form for the county yet? No, but I-I will. Yeah? Yeah. I mean, it's steady, right? What is it that Dad always says? That if you... If you do the work, then... "You get the result." But only if that's what you really want to do. I just am tired of filling in. I just want to feel like I have some type of control over my destiny. Mm, well, Hollywood is never gonna give you that. It's a cooking show! It's not some big action film. Yeah, I... I might need you to resend that link. You got it, sweetheart. We love you. Love you more. Okay, so this is today's schedule. Uh, Brooklyn... here. Okay, um, I'll be right back. Just got to make a phone call. Dean, the vans are ready to take us to Pena Palace. You sure are pretty, Portugal. Hold it... right there. For your poster. Poster? Your TV career doesn't end here. What? You're a cooking nerd, right? I mean, I don't know if I'd call myself a nerd, but... Ahem. Okay, fine. Yes. Why? You're approachable. More than some. Which is why I was willing to be on camera for you, and not just for the free food. You are a generally tough customer. I know you think Dean is the personality, but the people want to watch you. The crew wants to work for you. That's very sweet of you to say, but... as you just saw, I was fired, so it's kind of impossible. Except Hope and I just had a little chat, and, uh, while she can't override Dean, she thinks there might be enough footage for a pilot. Your pilot. Mm-hmm! All that's missing is an ending. You're serious? Hope says the network is intrigued. If we show 'em a little bit more, they just might bite. Well, when? Aren't you guys supposed to be setting up at the palace? Hope's covering for us. Well, you know if Dean finds out, you're next... both of you. Yeah, I don't care. It's time I started doing what I want anyway. So what do you say? Should we get cooking? Okay... camera there. Cooper, this is where I'll be plating, then we go outside... I want the audience at home to see all of this. We end up at the table. Food is going to look great here. We have some options for you. Okay. Yes. No. No. Yes. No. - And Cooper? - Yeah? I'd like a round table. Okay. You obviously have something to say... just say it. You realize I know nothing about being a prep cook. I think we both know more than we realize, and we just need to own it. Plus... I need you. I know that. And our chef only has an hour until she has to catch a plane! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Lighting isn't quite right. Everything you shoot looks amazing. I'll take that. Okay. Okay... You ready? Ready as I'll ever be. We had to push an hour because we've had some production delays, one of which... We no longer have a prep cook. I realize you're not thrilled by the way things have played out. I watched the footage... of Anna. And? And she's good. She's always been good. Yes! It's the reason why I hired her. You have always been able to spot talent. Maybe I was a bit hasty. You? Hasty? Well... Hey, but there is something you can do. Uh... why do I feel like I just stepped out into a Jane Austen novel? Are you a fan? Maybe. Good! Because that's how I wanted this to feel... Like a relaxed-but-elevated picnic. With lavender rack of lamb? Yeah, and lots of other goodies. Okay, your lighting's perfect. Oh, come... sit! You have to eat with me. Best table's a crowded one. It, uh, sounds like you just found your tagline. Oh, my gosh, I think you're right. Ahem. "The best table is a crowded one." I love it! May I join? Hope? What are you doing here? Does Dean know? He called the network and he vouched for you and your new pilot. He did? Yeah, I mean, for all Dean's many, many flaws, he has an appreciation for natural talent. So, of course, now he wants you to hit it out of the park. So here we are! So what can we do? Where are we at? Please, come, sit... eat and enjoy. Guys, come eat! - I made that. - Let's crowd this table! You made this? Well, with help. I made them with help. - It looks great, guys. - Wow. Oh, great! Mm. So good. So good. Okay. What's next? This is fantastic. So... where do I sit? Could you give this a pass? Thanks. So, uh... it's time to try the lamb. Oh, yes. Here's to the chef... and... to more room around the table. Thank you. And that's a cut. Who's up for a shot of ginja? - Oh, yes! - Yes. Well, the wheels are already turning. "A Sous in Sevilla"? Think about it. Fingers crossed. That'd be incredible. That'd be so cool. Hey, uh, I was hoping you might want to join me for a port... Just the two of us? Yeah. Finally. To the new show. I cannot believe this is happening. Well, I'm 100% in. Yeah. Well, to best mates. No. I mean... I mean, yes, but... But no. We are best mates, but... I messed up that night. Oh? Watching you lately, I don't know... the light's just shifted and... brought everything into focus. You are not only my best friend, but... the most amazing woman I have ever met. Well... that's... probably a good thing. 'Cause I never stopped having feelings for you. Does that mean you're gonna give me another chance? You know I'm not going in first. Yes, Chef.
