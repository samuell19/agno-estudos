No! No! Help me, please. Help. My wife, she's hurt bad. Please call somebody. Oh, hey, hey, oh, okay. There he is. Where have you been? I'm sorry guys, I got caught up. This place is amazing. Don't tell me you went to go see "Hall of Faces" without me. Oh my God, Calvin! Are you serious? You're supposed to be out promoting the comic like the rest of us, not off sightseeing. You stop at one booth, get sucked into another, and then another, and then it's down the rabbit hole. We're supposed to be a team. Come on, Kadabara. It's his turn to promote this shit. Ammo, come on. No! You can't expect her to do all the work. It's her moment too. Well, did we sell anything? And we gave a few away to give the word out. Damn. Only one? It's aspirin, I have a headache from all of this. Look, I'm sorry I left you guys hanging. This here is garbage. I'm your father, son! Monster Force Zero, issue numero uno. Could be a collectable one day. For you? 50% off, today only. Already got mine, for free. Damn. Not too mint. Who took a dump on that? Why don't you call your first issue numero zero? Yeah, of course. Mhm. Well, I could still do that, like a prequel. Mhm. Or a limited edition. I'll trade you. If you dig it, tell your friends. Thanks A.I.. Like us on Facebook. Fuck Facebook! You're really wicked, homeboy. Can I help? You? MF Zero, what's that stand for? Monster Force Zero. We're a ragtag team of... Motherfucking losers? That's really clever. Are you a writer? Getting a little ahead of yourself, Space Boy. You could barely sell those comic books, let alone the action figures. Where's the rest of your "Force"? They probably ditched his ass. Aw, come on, dude! Look, I get it. The glory days are over. Your character's abilities haven't evolved since high school. Glory days? Shit, son. We are Destroyers of Destruction! Glory continues to this day, son. Oh my God. I have heard of you guys, actually. I know. Well, since I have the honor of standing in front of the Upstate Cosplay champs, I've been dying to ask you guys a question. It's $25 for a selfie. No. Destroyers of Destruction, what does that even mean? We destroy destruction. And we're like completely badass. Glory will leave you speechless, says the mighty Final Boss. Did you just quote yourself? You're a bit of a smart ass, hot shot. And just who are you supposed to be? I'm A.I. I possess technology granted to me by ancient aliens. I'd go into it more, but it takes some brainpower. I'm guessing you are Hateful Boozer, Pretentious Creed, and... I am not a hater. Mr. Banana Hammock. Easy. This one's got a pair on him. But does he have what it takes to enter into Scrimmage Sanctum? The Scrimmage Sanctum? Main event was yesterday, and we won. There's a private exhibition tonight. The team that was supposed to face us, well, they bitched out. And we need a team to replace them. Hey, what's going on here, guys? Yeah. Who's this? Chick van Dyke and New Found Girly? Okay. What the fuck did you just say to me? Monster Force Zero, meet the Destroyers of Destruction. I'll show you destruction. Say something to me again, Hoodie Boy. Hey, Calvin. Maybe we should start packing up. Offer's on the table, Calvin. Check in's 11 sharp, Suite 1300. Think of it this way. Just showing up might help you sell some of those shitty comic books. I was about to uppercut him in the face for real. Suite 1300? That's where the Galaxy Fest after party is. What's going on? Guys, this could be huge. DoD challenged us to a private exhibition cosplaying... Oh, fuck them. A match with DoD is good for the brand. It could boost sales, maybe even get a couple hundred likes on Facebook. Calvin, I'm tired, we're tired. Three months on the road. Can't we just have a quiet night before we head back out in the morning? Look, I'm so grateful for everything you guys have done for me. I would've quit so long ago without you. It's just this one last thing. Ammo, this is what we wanted. Think I'll get a chance to punch Hoodie Boy in the dick? No. Honestly, you have to stop punching people in the dick. Well... We made it this far. All right, let's do it. Let's do it, let's do it, let's go. - Yeah, woo! - Woo! Let's go. MF Zero. Cool script. Cuneiform. Yeah, Sumerians. Ancient Aliens. Good show. So, what's your story? Excuse me? You, what are you supposed to be? We're Monster Force Zero. We're a ragtag team of outcasts, tech nerds, and sci-fi geeks scouring the globe hunting down depraved terrorist groups and malevolent cabals that are secretly backed by diabolical alien forces. Monster Force Zero is our comic. I wrote it, Ammo's the artist, and Kadabra here made the costumes. Wow, you guys are makers. That's great, man. We need more creators. One foot in front of the other foot. Put in the work, but enjoy the ride. I've heard that. Guess this is it. Open up! Invitation, please. Invitation? No invitation gets you as close as this door. Excuse me. Hello, sir! Welcome back! They're with me. Oh, of course! Right this way. Is it luck? No, you make your own serendipity. What's that smell? I think it's a furry! Astro Boy's here. Glad you decided to come. Prepare to be crushed! Ugh. Muah. Ugh. Welcome, welcome. For those who don't know, I am Ann Unaki. Ann Unaki? What is it? Welcome to tonight's exhibition match. I know, I'm late. You wouldn't believe the traffic out there, I don't know how you humans... Do it. Could you please take your seat? What are they doing here? I thought we had this settled with the Destroyers. We found a team to compete against us, so game on! These humans look even more stupid than the Destroyers! Adding Monster Force Zero to the equation increases our chances. We have no time to spare. How is this good? Quiet! Take your seat, now. Okay. Listen, lady. We came here to kick some ass. Right, guys? - Yeah! - Yeah! Let's get a move on. Aw. All right, what's going on? We put together this contest to figure out which team can help us. Help you with what? Gunns? What... I want his power. I've waited my whole life. Gunns Lazer, power ray blast! What? You all right, bro? What the hell was that? That was incredible. I never felt anything like it before, it was better than sex. Hey! More! More! Please, do that to me again. I'm losing patience. They just need time to understand. They unlocked Gunns' brain. We, us humans, only use 10%. Humans? This exhibition is a contest to see who has what it takes to reveal your true potential. So, welcome to the Scrimmage Sanctum. Two teams will enter, one team will leave victorious. DoD, you're red team. Yeah! Monster Force Zero, you're blue. Rad. Excuse me? Yes, what is it? Monster Force Zero is missing a team member. Monster Force Zero, where's your fourth team member? We don't have a fourth member. The comic has an actual yeti in it, and I couldn't afford a costume. What about that jackhole? You want to join our team? A yeti with moon boots? Now I've seen everything. What's your superpower besides drooling everywhere? That's so badass. Ugh, please. So, the yeti with the boots, he's a member of your team? We have four. I'm gonna call you Boots. All right already. Start the damn game. Furrious, if you would please. I'll give you the intel. Track Furrious and he will lead you to the Scrimmage Sanctum. He won't make it easy for you. The first team to collect their intel wins. Any questions? I think we understand. DoD is a go. We're in. The story gives meaning to your life, and your life gives meaning to the story. In rare moments of decision, destiny is shaped. Future favors the bold. The game has already begun. Come on, these guys are pansies. The furry. Hey, where'd that furry fucker go? Where'd he go? Taking a step into the dark is braver than leaping into the light. In other words, guys, you'll find what you're looking for out there. Come on, guys. We should split up. What? Split up. Yeah! I'm going that way. I got this way. Ugh. Shh. Hands off, dickless! Get your ass off the floor! Get the fuck up! I found Furrious. Over there. Let's go. Where do you fuckers think you're going? Come on, asshole. Try touching me one more time! Lights out! Now who's your father, son? I don't see no furry, Calvin. Well, he never came out. Or this was the wrong door. No. I would've seen him. There's gotta be like a hidden door or something. Wait, guys. The music. What the hell? Was this a setup? Seems like a lot of trouble to just lock us in a janitor's closet. That janitor, he could be on DoD's side. No, I don't think so. I guess it's possible. We don't know any of these people, you guys. I'm about to kick the fucking door down. Help! What did you just do? Whoa, that costume is so rad. Oh my God, you guys. Glow in the dark? Boots, hit that switch again. No way that works. Do or do not. There is no try. Fuck yeah! This is the main floor. The 13th floor is down? No way. But how? This is incredible. More like impossible. I think at this point, we need to be willing to accept anything as a possibility. Hey, guys! Is it a beacon? Too easy. Well, maybe it's a prize for solving the puzzle in the janitor's closet. Okay. Let's say this is one of the beacons. That means one of us has the chance to unlock our abilities. Who wants to go first? You don't say much, do you? You don't have to do it, Calvin. If anyone's gonna fall into a trap, I want it to be me, not you. Not you guys. Collectively. We're here for you, man. You got this. Well, future favors the bold. Calvin? Calvin! Gunns was right. This feels incredible. Whoa! Calvin! I've never felt anything like that. That is so cool though. Yeah! Get back. Hi ho, humans, heroes. Welcome to Scrimmage Sanctum. We'll answer the call, who will take the mantle of the real superheroes of planet Earth? We will! Welcome, the Destroyers of Destruction versus Monster Force Zero! I was wondering when they were gonna show up. I'm gonna finish what I started, bitch. Bring it, asshole! A member of each team has destroyed a beacon. Remaining beacons are here in Scrimmage Sanctum. Be the first team to destroy all the beacons to reunite with Furrious. Oh yeah, we got this, team. DoD! Which one do you think it is? I'm gonna say Gunns. Remember, the first team to gain the intel wins! If the team annihilates the opposition before destroying all the beacons... Invalidated. That team will automatically unlock their abilities and meet Furrious. If the contestant is on the brink of death, action will stop. The loser will be eliminated from the competition and moved to a holding area. You ready, gang? Let's invalidate these assholes! I've heard all I need to hear. Let's destroy these punks! Yeah, get him, Gunns! Woo! Easy, bro. Well, that escalated quickly! Good luck, humans. Ammo, find the other beacons. I'll cover you. Be careful, Calvin. Get your hands off me! Fuck you, Gunns! I'm just trying to help. I don't need your help. One more thing. Kadabra unlocks her powers next. Wait, why me? Trust me. You know what your character is capable of. I don't necessarily agree with this decision. I got the next one, got it? Shut up, you guys! Look! Homeboy thinks he can take us on. He probably can. Let me at him! No, he's mine. Go after the others. Finding our beacons first would be the better move. I'm not gonna repeat myself! Easy, man! Chill. I'm just trying to come up with some fucking tactics. Star Boy's blocking the path. Then I'll just have to clear it away! Wait. Do you know where we're going? Yes. Maybe. Hey, you know you could talk to us? Are you done yet? Come at me, bro! Gunns Lazer, power ray blast! Pathetic. A.I. invalidated! Destroyed. Oh no. Don't hurt yourself in there. Did you guys hear that? The beacons. I don't believe it! The power! It's incredible. Hey, watch it, son! Hey! That beacon was mine. We've gotta get you to that beacon, Kadabra. Right. Hey, what's wrong? Wake up. Sorry, just overloaded here, I... Don't go getting a panic attack on me now, girl. You're one bad bitch, you got that? Good. Boots, you up for drawing Hoodie Boy out of the area? Beautiful. Kadab. The moment you unlock your powers, you hit his ass with your telekinesis, you got that? Okay, I'll try. Hopefully that'll keep Boots from getting knifed. I'm kidding. I'm just trying to lighten the mood. I hate to ruin your plans. Wait, no I'd love to. Where's A.I.? Rocket Boy got his ass invalidated. And you're next! Go. I got this douchebag. But Ammo! Stick to the plan. Plans end here and now. DoD! Hey! I just climbed all the way up here! Come get me down. That was a bad idea! Get up! Nice prop. Nice hit. Gunns Lazer invalidated! Ammorama invalidated! Ammo. Fuck! Where the fuck am I? You're in what I think is the penalty box. Deep breaths. Oh, I'm gonna vomit. Monster Force Zero, you have invalidated a member from the Destroyers of Destruction. One of you is now free to return to the arena. I feel like shit, man. You go get those motherfuckers. I got this. Feel the wrath of the mighty Final Boss! Yetiboot invalidated! Whoa. Looks like I joined the wrong team. Sorry. We're not taking new members. Quiplash invalidated! I feel dizzy. I would say that's normal, but what would I know? I can't tell what's real anymore. This is. Time for a reality check! Final Boss invalidated! That was awesome. I went for the other beacon while you two were busy all over each other. Get a room. Oh my God. You guys are like, so badass. Drone Bot. How may I help you? Invalidate this bitch before I do. Hey! Hot Babe invalidated. Bye, Felicia. Boots! Welcome back, Boots! Destroyers of Destruction invalidated! Your winners, Monster Force Zero! I told you. Idiots! How did they lose? Negative. They might still prove helpful to the cause. Damn stupid humans! Anger is a savage boomerang. What? When you lose your temper, you lose. Best remedy for a short temper is a long walk. Say another trite piece of human philosophy... When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be. Do you forget all we've done for you? Do you forget who's keeping her alive? I will pull the plug myself. Not now, not yet. At least let me kill the human's spouse. He won't know anyway. You heard me. How's the pacer, Mr. Janitor? In the garage, ready to go. Thank you. Please go and retrieve Monster Force Zero. Apologies, Ann. The human annoys me. It will never happen again. It had better not, or the price you will pay will be dear. Remember your rank and your place. Congratulations, Monster Force Zero! You have invalidated the competition, and in doing so, Yetiboot's abilities have been unlocked. Whoa! All right! That was so awesome! Boots, that was awesome! You as a team have reached your true potential. Now I introduce to you, Furrious! There's that smell again. On behalf of Furrious and the Force that has cleared the sanctum, I present to you, the intel! Yeah! Yes! Well, ain't that just grand? We always enjoy when Furrious stops by. Okay, folks. I want to personally thank you for playing. I'm your host, Drone Bot 64. Thank you and good night, everybody! I mean getting this, like, we're being recorded. Hey! You know, I could get you a better copy of that. You know, I wrote the comic, so I could get you a new one that doesn't look awful, if you want. Hop in. Ann Unaki's expecting you. Now that is insane! Right? That was insane! You blasted a dude in space! Guys. Look who's here. MF Zero. Yay. How are you? Seriously? Better than the Destroyers. Open the case. Impressive. Congratulations, Monster Force Zero. You are now ready to proceed to the next level of the game. They call themselves "The Unidentified". Dr. Iolanda Eeche, PhDs in biochemistry from Stanford. Nano science, and astrophysics, genetics from Cal Tech. She's one of the most gifted humans in your history, or future. She has developed anti-viruses for Ebola and HIV. She has figured the composition of dark matter and dark energy. Of course, we already knew this. Still, it is impressive. Why do you keep referring to us as humans? Yeah. Before we go any further, who are you guys? I am Anunnak. Ann Unaki? Correction, human. Anunnak. What is an Anunnak? It's a being from the planet Nebaru. Better known as Planet X. Ancient aliens. Hold up. Aliens? All of you are aliens? Oh, I'm human. But I've assisted Anunnak and Igigi for a while now. Igigi? Gray aliens. So, there are others? I'm an Igigi, satyr reptilian. You know, Roswell, Devil's Tower. Devil's Tower is from "Close Encounters". Is it? We traveled light years to stop the Unidentified from accessing the multiverse. We arrived too late. They were waiting for us. The Unidentified have pulled some sort of organism through. We believe he might be an Alpha Draconian. A Gamma Reptilian being from the multiverse. It could be the ender itself. We aren't sure. We thought we'd wiped this wicked race from the galaxy eons ago. They are an aftermath to life, more to us than any. To smell them, look at them, hear them, it's toxic to us in the highest degree. Just see one and you die? Paralyzed and death. The Unidentified have no idea what they might unleash. Not just for the Reptilians, but for the rest of the multiverse. Our ground assault failed. We can no longer run the risk of being detected. This is why you are here, now. Dr. H knows the truth about human history, and the truth about us. She doesn't like it. She's seeking to eradicate us. She must be stopped now. She's near completion of the quantum computer. Is that really so bad? What side are you on, human? Bigfoot's real? So as the relative to Yeti, humans would exploit them. We had helped them stay hidden. But this Squatch betrayed us and his kind. Beware. He isn't stupid. He's evolved highly as a survivor and hunter. I thought you guys might like this. Whoa! Cha-ching! Right out of Ultraman. Speaking of. That is your body camera and your compass. Keep it with you at all times, or we will not be able to help you. Got it. They're here, and there's no more time to waste. You will use the pacer to automatize, as close as it's safe. Let's buckle up. Uh, guys. Can we go back for my wand? I think I left it at the hotel. Dab, come on. We don't have time. Oh. Hello there, I'm Garrett Wang. You may remember me from that one sci-fi series? You know, the one with the aliens. Welcome. You will be arriving at your destination in 90 seconds. Actually, you're already there. But let's foster the illusion. Human evolution was accelerated by the Anunnaki aliens. They came as peaceful friends to our broken, yet life-giving chunk of Tiamat. All of the great mysteries of Earth are thanks to them, in one way or another. While we hominids were boosted, we were not fully unlocked, so our progress could be monitored and we could be kept safe. These mysteries were revealed over 6,000 years ago to the ancient Sumerians. The Anunnaki aligned with the Igigi, more commonly known as the "Grays", in the only known war of this galaxy. The Sumerians helped their friends for the greater good against the chaotic Alpha Draconian Reptilians. They were banished to the multiverse. We, you and I, all humans, are of the Sumerians. Though there are those who want to bring the Reptilians back. It is time for us to fight together once more. Well, that's it. Good luck on your mission, 'cause you're gonna need it. That was all right, yeah? I mean, I felt about 80% on that, but I think it's passable. Is it the sound... Monster Force Zero. Your performance in the Scrimmage Sanctum was commendable. If you continue to work as a team, you will succeed in your mission. You're not coming with us? I have to get back and assist Ann Unaki in the garage. I'm in their debt. Sounds serious. A.I. You have the element of surprise. Follow the yellow brick road. Let's go, guys. I think... We got a possible threat. I can't make it out completely. Some sort of energy field that's highly unstable. A weapon? What are you doing? So much for the element of surprise! I had to test this thing out! I've never fired one of these things before. Put that thing away. Anunnaki are making their move. I'm pulling the rip cord! No. We don't know if we can control it. We can't wait to find out. Yes, that was always plan B. Send in the Squatch. Do you hear that? Let's take it slow. Ammo, what the hell? I can't help it. I have an itchy trigger finger. You need to put that thing away. Fuck you, popper. Hey! Come on! Both of you guys? You're so uptight. With our powers combined, we can take the Unidentified. And this baby seals the deal. She'll be okay. She's probably just going through withdrawals. You're a real piece of work. The bitchy one's going to ruin the plan. Give them time. The Destroyers are still in the shed. How's our team? Struggling. Well, there will be moments of dysfunction, but it'll only make them stronger. Or get them killed. Hey. Chloe. Is everything all right? I feel sick to my stomach. You don't have to hide it from me. The past few months just have been really hard for me. I didn't realize the circuit was taking such a toll on you. I'm not an extrovert. Okay, like you, or Ammo. I need time to recharge, and I haven't really had that at all. Sorry, if I had known... It's okay. It's okay. It's my thing. Not anybody else's. I didn't know, I'm sorry. I was a part of something. I was part of a team. I just wanted to be near you. I'm sorry it took three months. Don't be sorry. No, silly. We're not alone. Ammo! Oh, fuck! Why do you want to fight us? We're your friends. We're your friends. Who are they? Do something! What are you doing? Low orbit V.R. cannon. Call Anunnaki psi-ops and rays. You feelin' all right? Shouldn't we be asking you? I'm really sorry, guys. From here on out, we remain a team no matter what. All right? Right. Enough. This is the Unidentified? Why do you fight for the Anunnaki? You're fighting on the wrong side of history. Sloppy born human, your stupid apes are still killing each other over who has a real God. Better than being Frankenstein monsters for your freaks. Look what came out. Janitor! I'm not doing this anymore. Is that so? Then there's no reason to keep her alive anymore. That's what I thought. You will do as you are told. I think it may be time for plan D. These stories of destruction are only our last resort. Monster Force Zero can still infiltrate on the base of operations. That blast will be more than enough to eliminate the Gamma Reptilian. What just happened? Where's Squatch? Let's get him. This is it. I've never seen you so confident. Get used to it. You! You are an insult to our kind. You're a fraud. I want a rematch, ape! You humans are all the same. That Sasquatch knows that Boots is just some dude in a suit, right? He is just a guy in a suit, right? Shh. Enough of this crazy shit. Take us to Dr. Eeche. Now. We need to talk. No. I don't know where the nearest comic book store is. She is a bit antisocial. We're here for that. You obviously have no idea what you've gotten yourself into. We're not gonna let you destroy our planet. Is that what the Anunnaki told you? You really are a tool. The space rex, Gamma Reptilian, was brought here to protect Earth from them. All targets acquired! Detonate! What the hell is that thing doing? What have you done? Something's coming through! Monster Force Zero... What is saying? Increase to 5000 hertz. Guys! Better. The Anunnaki... 10,000. The Anunnaki, bomb, get rid of it. Bomb? That thing's a bomb, get rid of it! He did it? Send the Destroyers to confirm. Mr. Janitor, prepare the pacer. Mr. Janitor? Congratulations Destroyers of Destruction! You have been selected for a mission. Thanks, big guy. ) Easy. Yeah. What's that? Oh no! It's been released. What do we do? Ah, it's too late to turn back now. Get in the car, and we'll go right at 'em. We don't have the coordinates! My car! Not so fast. Great. The Fantastic Fucks are here. Seeing is believing, says the mighty Final Boss. Listen. I know you guys are looking for a rematch, but now is not the time. I disagree! Now's the perfect time! You guys... That's a fucking monster. We need to put our differences aside right now, or this thing is gonna kill all of us. All right, Space Boy. Let's blast him. No! We need a plan. My name's A.I. Fine, A.I. What the fuck do we do? Let the Final Boss destroy this thing! I wouldn't do that. Quiet, woman! This lizard is no match for a mighty Final Boss! Get them to the car. Kadabra, blast thing thing with your cognitive powers. I don't think it works on astrosaurs. Enough of this wimpy shit. Gunns Lazer, power ray blast! - To the car! - To the car! Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. The lizard has a laser? Lasers. The Anunnaki amassed an army at our doorstep. We had to let the Gamma Reptilian through. Have you ever heard of mutually assured destruction? Everybody in the forest! They're all yours, Star Boy! Is the pacer ready? Ready. Go, get out of here. I got this. Go! What are you guys doing? We're MF Zero. A ragtag team of outcasts, tech nerds, and sci-fi geeks. Scouring the globe, searching for... I always forget that line! It's too long anyways. It's coming! What do we do? I've been winging it since the Sanctum. It's hot! Get to the front of the pacer. Kadabra, keep the shield on us as long as you can. Get ready to knock its ass in. Now, push it in! You go around and help her. I'll drive it right into him, we can't afford any mistakes. Enough! Hey, lizard! This bitch wants pancakes! Get him, now! I'm coming, honey. MF Zero! Where'd the Destroyers go? You told them to run, and they ran. They're probably still running. So, what now? Monster Force Zero, thank you for your help. The Anunnaki will regroup, we have to find the Gamma Reptilian and return it to stasis. I'm sorry for your loss. The Janitor was a brave man. He'd probably say the needs of the many outweigh the needs of a few. Protecting Earth has been our mission for centuries now. We'll take it from here. Centuries? There may come a time when the Earth is in need of you, and when that day comes... We'll be ready. You fought well. Not bad for a bunch of humans. I've never fought a Sasquatch before, but you weren't half bad yourself. Anyone else hungry? Oh my God, dude! I'm starving. IHOP? Now you're talking. Hey, Boots! When you gonna take that mask off?
