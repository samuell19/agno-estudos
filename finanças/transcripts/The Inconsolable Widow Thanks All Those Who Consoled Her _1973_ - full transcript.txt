Take your time, Think of your wife. If I think of you, I can't wait ... Yes. If I think of you, I can't wait to... Since the late Santonnocito Salvatore did not leave a will Article 544 of the Civil Code is enforced automatically... ... which says the following: If there are no legitimate children ... the legitimate heirs of the deceased will take possession of all assets ... while the wife receives only 5 / 12 of the estate. - Nonsense - That is the law, ma'am. - Now you're talking, lawyer. - Calm down. We cannot object on article 544. Hard or large, is an unjust law. Why is it unjust, madam? In my opinion it is right. Don't you think it was nice that my late brother though of his relatives? After all, we're the same blood. - To leave everything to a stranger? - That's what you call her? A young, beautiful, wife who gave her body to an old... - Mother, please. - You shut up. It's not fair to leave the widow with the husk... ...after the fruit has been eaten. - A peach ... - Shut up, Nico. Fruit has no connection, Mr. Notary. The fruit has already been paid. - What? With pennies? - Enough with the fruit and pennies. Do you think you're in the marketplace? I'm not for sale. Your presence is indispensable. Where are you going? - To show Katerina out. - You want to go now? Are you mad? What kind of lawyer are you? Yes, of course. I must make an announcement. Let's follow the legal rules governing succession. Exactly. Article 544 specified by me explains it quite clearly. Yes. Dear notary, but one instance was not considered... What instance, lawyer? Come, lawyer, speak... Why wait? If the consort is expecting a child... A child? Finally, he said it. - Mother, but I ... - Keep quiet. Let the lawyer talk. - It's absurd. Impossible. - Our brother couldn't do it... - I think there is a solution. - Suggest it to me! Let me explain. My late brother, Salvatore, was... - Was sterile. Because of a sin of youth, My brother could not have children. - Can you prove it? - My brother was ashamed of it. For us, this is a disgrace. - There remains only to wait. - Wait and see... What do you expect? - DO you hear her? Poor thing didn't know what to expect. She knows. My daughter is just fatalistic. The baby will come when it comes. Then, let's wait for the child. More than nine months is too much. - In reality it is ten. - Ten months? - What is this novelty? - The notary can tell you. Article 232 of the Civil Code makes it clear. It takes 300 days to assume that the child was conceived during the marriage. That's right. I think those two are trying to fool us, but they will fail. The living will be destroyed by the dead... What you looking at, idiot? Did you hear what I said? Look what you got me into. Don't worry, we have article 232 on our side. Yes, madam. But please be calm. That's most important. The child will born, in spite of you. - I want to see how. - He will be born. A stork will bring it. The miracle bird... From now on I'll watch you. Such birds will not enter your home. - What are you doing? Say something. Don't answer. A fine help you are. - It is a matter of education. - Get away, I drive. Descend from the clouds ... Wait a moment. Bravo, lawyer. The child issue saved the day. - Their arrogance deserves a lesson. - But there's no baby ... - There is, lawyer How? I mean there will be. It's the same thing. Get in, lawyer, we can't talk in the street. - I have a meeting. - Are you our lawyer or not? You won't leave us right now. Hop in. We'll talk at home. I have my dignity. I will not sleep with the first man I meet. Who told you that you must sleep with the first one? - It may the the first, it may be the second. - Stop it. What do you think, lawyer? Do I seem an easy woman? - Honestly... - Katerina, the lawyer is defending our interests. What are our interests? For you to have a baby. - Am I right, lawyer? If there had been an heir everything would be solved. - But since there isn't... You said it. Holy words. You hear, Katerina? You need an heir. And what are you doing? Will you do it? We can not think of that. Good or bad, Salvatore was my husband. I respect his memory. I have no intention of selling myself. I'm not a prostitute. Prostitute? No. Just stupid. My Katerina, billions are not found on the street. You can make a sacrifice to have them... I admit it's a sacrifice. By the way, lawyer. Can you not participate at this sacrifice? - You understand, right? - Give a hand... - Me? - I forbid you. - Stop. In fact, the lawyer is not bad. He's graceful... manly ... He's a handsome man. We must take emergency measures. Emergency countermeasures. - What do you suggest, a chastity belt? Let's do it. Why not? Perhaps I will Put her in a chastity belt. What's my concern? - 10 billion are at stake here. - 15. - That's plenty. - A lot... And we are full of debts. We must not let them fool us. And how do we do it? We'll isolate hem. They stay in the villa, you and I will encircle it with a ring of guards. Stay calm, they won't even smell men. Not one over ten years old will approach the house. - But what about Baldo, the lawyer? - Yes, you forgot the lawyer. - Why worry about him? - He's a man. - What's the problem? - How? - Couldn't you tell? The lawyer... He's a sissy. Baldo's not... - So the lawyer is a queer. - I didn't want to offend you, madam. - If I knew, I would've taken another lawyer. What does sex have to do with lawyering? This is not professional. But related to my situation. Go away. Excuse me, madam, I appreciate your offer I am very pleased, but please understand me ... We understand. Your tool doesn't work. - How do you know what? - Let's put an end to it, counsellor. - I thought I found a bull, but ... - But it was a cow. - Let us not think about it. - Not think about it? We need to think quickly. We have little time. twenty days. Tell me if you want me to pick up men on the street. Don't talk nonsense, mother. I found it. This time I have an ace up my sleeve. They should continue at least a month of mourning in the house. Usually a month of abstinence is enough. - We must be vigilant, Nico. - We are cautious. The servant of the house. You must neutralise him. What are you talking about? Katerina with a servant? You think so? - How do I know. - Would she do it? You think a lady would do it with a servant? Even the most honourable woman in the world would sell herself for money. - It's a question of price. - What? I have no price. - I would not do it even for one billion. - What about for ten billion? If you do it, I'll break you in two. You can break me in four. - Calm down. - I'll kill her. - No, he won't. Be thankful that my brother and his children are here. - We are shopping. - Yes, we are in the store... - we discuss everything home ... - Tonight ... - Why? - What did we do? Because your mother is an honest woman. If you had been the children of a prostitute, you'd be more fortunate. Coming. My dear Giovanni, you have to understand, we are two single women, defenceless ... We're afraid at night... Who will protect us? - There are guards. - What will they do if thieves come? Uncle Cola is seventy-six years old and has a hernia, Uncle Turi and is seventy years old and has a stomach-ache, poor man. We need a young, strong man to defend us. - One like you. - If you want, I can sleep here. I'd like that. We have to increase your salary. Are you happy? Do not look at me like that, Salvatore. You know I will never agree. But if you made a will, I wouldn't be in this situation. - I'll go home to let my folks know. - Go ahead and put your clean underwear. Listen, Giovanni, if you go home, take a good bath. - Why, is it a holiday? - No, but it relaxes the nerves. You'll need that for your new job. Are you mad? In your opinion I should sleep with a servant? - I'll never do that. - I know, my daughter. If you give up now, it will get worse. In darkness, all men are created equal. Princes and servants. The world is going to hell, my daughter. - Listen to my advice, it's for your own good. - My marriage to Salvatore was the same. The same day, you made me give up three fianc?s. - And what has Salvatore left me? Nothing. - If you leave things like this... ... and listen to my advice, you'll have several billion. The idea to be in the arms of that animal makes me sick. Just close your eyes and let him do it. After nine months, you will thank me. - You stay here. - What are they doing? You come with me. Nico, do as I say, not one word more. Wait. Do you see that handsome man? - That is the most dangerous of all. - I kiss your hand, Don Tano. - Come here. Where are you going? - Home. Madam Francesca is afraid of thieves. - What do you do, bite? - I'm going to take my clean underwear. - Take a bath and go back to sleep in the villa. You understand? Clean linen, bath... What do you need all this? To scare the thieves? - Madam Francesca commanded me. If he mingles, we're done. Understand? - So do I need to come in? - No need to go anywhere. - How much do you earn per month? - 60 000. Hold out your hand. Look: 60.000 and a gift of 10.000. - You get a month vacation. - Don Tano, I ... You dropped your clothes. - You understand. - I understood everything. A month? Two months. We welcome you, Don Tano. Return at the end of the month to receive more money... Now I'll deal with the cook. You deal with the gardeners. - Get him too. - Let's go. Be Blessed, Don Tano. - Where are you going? - I'm getting madam's shopping. Right, right, food is needed. Put them down and rest up a bit. Bravo. - Now you cannot enter the house ... - Why, what happened? Nothing. We don't want any movement around here for a month. - What movement? - Just fooling. It's better to go home. - Uncle Turi, Uncle Cola ... - We are glad to see you, Don Nico. - How are you? - Can't complain. We're like the sequoia tree... Like the sequoias... Let's say: If you were to get a little action... What did you do? Now ... - If I had the opportunity, I would give it all out... - I would sleep with her ... - You've got to be joking. When the flower is ripe, it blooms and needs to be picked... And we're not withered, are we? - Not much. - Which means that our trunk is upwards... Get out of here. Why are you worried, my daughter? Don't be upset. Make it a nice experience ... - Look who's coming. - Move, Nicola. To which unpleasantness do we owe your visit? - I came to get your shopping. - And Lucia? - Lucia's sick. Her doctor recommended a few months' treatment. - And Carmela? - Her, as well. - And the gardeners ... - Yes, madam. The gardeners too. He's not coming. He is afraid to catch it as well. You've removed them all. You have isolated us. It's for your own health, madam. If you want, you can take as many servants as you find... around here. There are no servants, only mobsters like you. No mobsters here. People are just generous. We put others before ourselves to save what's in the back. Leave immediately if you to save your back ... I can't stand your insinuations. Why talk so, Katerina, we trust you. Trust? What would you have done otherwise? Put me in a safe? I am a free woman. I will leave immediately. Bravo, my darling. We leave tonight. You can leave when you want, but not Katerina. - She can't. - Who says so? Me. I must take care of the foetus. Look. My lawyer empowered me to take care of the foetus. - The foetus? - For your tummy. You can't travel. Instead of checking in and out, I have many doubts about the matter ... we want that Salvatore's successor to be born healthy, robust and vivid as his father. - Come on, Nico. Why are you bowing? No, my stomach hurts ... - Let's go. - I think I've caught a cold... I changed my mind. I'll have that baby. You're convinced that billions are billions. That's not it. I can't stand the idea of a guardian of my womb. They want war. They'll get it. What happened? Who brought you in this state? Who did you quarrel with? Coward... - What was it, politics or football? It's Santonnocito's widow. I should've shut up and not say she wants to become pregnant. Pregnant? Yes, because of the inheritance. I found out, a miracle ... - This stuff is secret. - Why, you wanted to get her pregnant yourself? And I, the fool, I told him, the miserable bastard. He told me: I can give you a hand. I told him: I know what to do. He told me: In two is safer. I was angry and I was beaten. Where am I? Where did they go? What you looking at, what do you see? I decided to have a baby and I will. Why? Are you the moralist now? A dirty bore like you... Things that I was afraid would disturb me in the sleep ... Maniac fetishist... It made me have cramps ... Forgot about that? After many beautiful nights, you couldn't even make me a baby. Try to understand, Salvatore. Does it seem fair that your brothers should get all the money? They always hated you and took advantage of you. Think how nice it would be to have a baby. Salvatore Santonnocito's child. In effect, as your child. In the eyes of the law and all others. Don't you agree? When reading the speech your secretary wrote for you... it was alright. Admit it, it's the same thing. Just imagine I'm a page o and someone is writing a speech on me. That's your problem. I'll do it anyway. It's better on this side, it''s more cautious. If you keep looking at me like that, I'll lock you up in a box. Or worse, I'll take you in mother's room. You see, Tano? Katerina went to bed. Everything we go seems pointless. Can't we go to bed as well? Are you serious? You can never take enough precautions. I have one guard every 20m. We're safe that way. We can trust them. - These are men with several arguments. - That's it. We need no people without arguments ... - Do you understand, Tano? Yes, but they do not use these arguments ... They have them as an honorary ... They have them as an addition ... But ... Look at this fellow... You came at last, Tano. What happened? Calm down. You're disturbing God. - Come and see. Thieves. - Thieves? How is this possible? Call the police. Hurry. Wait! First, let's see what they've stolen, and then talk. Calm down. Let's see what is missing. Check everything. It seems that nothing is missing. Look. No more money. It was about the money? You could've told me in advance. You frightened me for nothing. - What? It was everything we had. - I know ... I took it myself to save the heritage. - It was you? - Yes, madam, it was I. To pay the fellows. How do we get rid of servants? What about the cheques? They must be paid. Do not worry about cheques. Who cares? I'll buy the whole bank. - It's just a matter of days. What? - Read. - Let me see. Calm down. - Let me see. Where? - Here. - Obituaries. - That bitch ... She would compromise us at any price. Look. You know what she's doing? She calls everybody at the house... All men ... Listen. Widow Katerina in her great pain will receive today between 4 and 5pm ...friends and acquaintances who want to to honour the memory of the late Salvatore. Let's discuss his great virtues as man, citizen and captain of industry. - When did they make him captain? - After he died. Sincere condolences. To you, too, madam. - How is it? - Everything is fine. Onion tears. - Poor girl... Young and a widow. - And my husband is eighty-five years old... - A great loss. He was an example of civic virtue. He didn't manage as a young man, imagine how he is now... - The dress seems a little dark ... - It's nice, I'll make you one when you die. Condolences ... We must weep for a wealthy and respected man... - ...and also a true friend. He doesn't look too bad... - He must be sweet ... - Looks like a box of marmalade. - Can't you see he's a dwarf? - Yes, but dwarves... ... if you knew what they say about them... I didn't say anything. Put your handkerchief in. Why? It's the pain. It should be washed. I'm with you in your grief. Salvatore was an exceptional man. I'm Carlo Niscemi. I was a good friend of your husband's. My condolences, madam. It is a great loss. At this point, I'm very close to you. A lot. You like him? Relax, I've got it. - Wait. - There you were... - Excuse me, madam, where are you going? - None of your business. Where I am going none need follow me.. - Come, Nicolino. - I don't need to. Tano, why are we here? Haven't you seen? I saw a strange motion. That nice young man who Katerina welcomed... - That stranger. - Next to Katerina? - He's from Palermo. Salvatore was his friend. - Are you sure? - Katerina did not even know him. - Better. What are you doing? Why eat all the time? Hungry? You always take food from my mouth. - You came here too? We want to make sure that you do not need anything. - I do not need anything. - It's better this way. You see, Tano? She doesn't need anything. Goodbye, Katerina. I'm with you in your grief. - What do you keep saying hello? - She looks stunning in mourning. Yes. Salvatore's doing. Because of those two bastards we lost the last cock in the pen. I know whose fault it is, but don't be sorry. What do they say? A Pope died, We'll get another. If it goes for the Pope is true for the "papa", too. - Password. - We're done. What do you mean? You must ask, if the heir is born. The other responds: We're done for. - If the other does not respond ... - I strike him... - Is the heir born? - That's right. - Where are you going? - We're done for. - Now is good. We're finished. Never do that, or I'll beat you up. These are the orders. What should I do? What an idiot ... Apparently you're of good faith. What fools ... Tell me who hired you? Don Nico, your brother I see. Keep guard... I am a vigilant security guard ... Who is it? Damn. It's me. - But why ... ? Because... it''s difficult to say ... Yes, but to enter my room like a thief ... - You'll tell me why. I want to steal everything I can. All I want... - Steal everything you want... Do not scream. Patience; five minutes and I'm done. Don't move. Be quiet. You are beautiful, but I can't stop now. No yelling. Not yelling, it's a safe. Where is it? Where did he put them? Bastard ... Maybe under the front door. Where are they? Don't scream. Look at them. I'm happy. Finally ... What a pity. But I can't, I must go. Hands up. Put your foot down. Don't fire. It's me. Excuse me. I saw you creeping about ... and mistook you for a thief. You know what they say, lady. Opportunity makes man a thief. - Did you steal anything? - Everything, lady. So quickly? Katerina was understanding, she did not resist me... - Where are you going? - To sleep. - Spend the night with Katerina. - Night is made for love ... - Night is for sleeping. Maybe tomorrow ... - Wait ... - I can't stay. - Why not? - I did what needed to be done. - Not sure what I could do anymore. - What kind of man are you? - Won't you take advantage of a young woman? - Sorry, but I must go. - Mother is sick at home waiting for me. - Katerina loves you. I do not think so, she didn't say a word. Wait. You'll see Katerina ... What fresh air ... - Who is that? - We are blocked, tracked .... - ... buried alive. Have you seen? - Is it war? What happened? Now I can not explain. For this you must to return to Katerina. - It's safer. You must have confidence. - Not sure if Katerina trusts me. - She will. You can be assured. - Is that a partisan? Is war on? No, not a partisan. Be calm, have confidence. Bastard! You wanted to laugh at me? He who laughs last laughs longest. Katerina must be very tired. After all that was between us ... When I start, I'm like a storm, I ravaged her... Perhaps you are right. You must promise to return tomorrow. Certainly, tomorrow Katerina will be satisfied, I'll be back. You're still here? Cowardly bastard. And you, stop talking to him. After what he did. Calm down. Did you not want him to do it? He had to do it. He tied me and gagged me. Why did you use violence? Katerina is very honest but it was not necessary. She wouldn't... - And you my darling, how did you survive? - She struggled... You don't understand, mother. He didn't violate me, but the safe. I thought he was serious, but ... he is a thief ... Wait. Now I understand. I do not understand anything. Before you call the police, let me explain. - Is there little to explain? - No, it's a lot... I am here, defenceless, half-naked ... and you tie and gag me... and then start to steal. I had no choice. I had to take these damned cheques back. - What kind of cheques? - I'm not a thief, madam. I could've stolen money, jewellery, everything. As you saw, I only stole the cheques. - Nothing else. - It's true. - He just stole the cheques. - Only cheques. And you, between me and these vulgar cheques, you chose them. - I was desperate. - Five years ago ... to pay some debts, I turned to your husband Santonnocito He choked me with loans interest, interest on interest ... He took from me two orange groves, the citrus factory, four blocks and ten racehorses ... - ... And this villa. He grabbed the neck ... - So the villa was yours .. - That's how you new where the safe was. - Naturally. I had to take those cheques to restore my life. Call the police, I don't care about anything. If this is so ... I don't think it's appropriate. - Your name, Carlo ... - Niscemi. - He's a nobleman. - A baron. How romantic ... We have a gentleman thief. - Please don't condemn me... - Don't condemn him, Katerina ... I want you to forgive me. - Baron, my foot. Get out. - Calm down, dear. - I'll go. She's such a... - I'll take care of it... Let's show him we're well educated and friendly. Perhaps it's better to go to your room. - But if he stays... - I will call the police. Excuse her, Baron. When Katerina's angry, one can't speak to her. Let's talk... Can I call you by you first name? It would be my pleasure... - Can I offer you a drink, Carlo? - You are kind. I don't drink shots... Weapons makes me afraid. Here's something to pucker you up. - My head spins ... - Stretch. And now I can't feel my palm... You should know from the beginning ... Katerina must have a child. I am amazed, she's not fat ... Of course, she doesn't have it yet... She must make it... Immediately. Understand? Tonight? I don't understand. My head spins. I'll explain it to you. As my late son-in-law Salvatore, may he be healthy and live in peace among angels... but he died without leaving a will ... - If the heir is born... ? - We're done for. Go and check the others. Let's think a little, Francesca. Even if I wanted, after what happened, she surely won't. I'll take care of Katerina. This is business... Katerina will have her inheritance, and you, your cheques. You know how much are my cheques worth? - A hundred million ... - For this you must pay. - Why? I am not a horse. - It's the same thing. - Here's my son-in-law's pyjamas. - The dead one's? Gives me the shivers. - They're clean. - Smells like a dead man... Slippers and a robe ... you'll find the rest in the bathroom. Take them back, I can't. I prefer to go to jail. - Maybe I'll kill myself. I'm off. - How are you leaving? By helicopter? - Are you going fly? - Why? We're circled. You saw what's outside. Those are mobsters. You won't even have a funeral. - They will shoot you on the spot. - What should I do? - If you lose them, I'll call the police. - Just look how everybody treats me... Why are you crying? You get food and a place to sleep... in return for thirty days and the most wanted widow in the country. - I don't know ... - How can you not know? Just help me become a grandmother and you have my blessing. - Well, grandmother. What should I do? - You called me grandmother? Go in the bathroom and get ready, handsome. Meanwhile, I'll work on Katerina. - Work her well. Once a mother, always a mother. - If the heir is born? - We're done for. Katerina, be quiet, it's me. I'm ready. I told him that to have what he had, he must give what he promised. - Let's forget the past, as the song says. - Katerina's now waiting. - ... More in love than the first time. - What, more in love that first time? When she first saw you at the wake. It struck her like lightning. I understand. But how can she love me? Did you tell her you'll give me cheques if I... No. If she finds out, it's over. Please don't tell her. She thinks you're lovesick. - You've got her hot and ready... - Don't let her cool off. - Faster. - Do not push me. - Sorry, I was excited to ... - To enter the conversation? Can I call you Katerina? You can do whatever you want ... Come here... One moment. First I want to explain. No need. I was married. - I know everything. If we continue like this, we won't meet the deadline. - Listen, Katerina. - Why talk? Our love needs two things. Thoughts and action ... - Slow? - Hot... You're right, Katerina. It needs action. I'll Serve you immediately. Wait a moment. I won't even undress. I'm yours ... Now you're mine ... You're so hot... You're on fire... Finally, justice triumphs. Keep guard... at each hole ... The child will be born anyway. - What's happening? What is it, Carlo? - Nothing. Excuse me, my dear. Must be a nervous contraction. - Where? Tell me. - How can I? - You're all sweaty. You're hot ... - Yes, the head is hot, but the rest ... - Where? The chest? - No, below. - Stomach? - Below. I swear it never happened before. - Imagine that... - Do not be disappointed, sweetheart. - I love you, I care about you. - That's just it. I love you and care for you. You are beautiful, delicious, wonderful ... - I don't know what to do. - Do what you want. With what? I have to go. - Where you going? - Far. Wherever. - I must forget this disgrace. - You can not, the house is surrounded. The guards are outside. What can I do? O Lord, how? I can't stay here. You cannot understand that I'm destroyed, I can't stay. - Calm down, dear. - How to calm down? - How can I? - Relax. You must forgive me, Katerina. I want to love you ... but will is not enough. It's like your brain is not sending impulses. You understand? - And what now? - You must unlock it. - I must have it washed. - What? My brain. For example, thinking about something else. Let me calm down. For example, thinking of childhood. No. When I was a child, it was worse. I'm not sure, I need to think about something. I need to unlock. Even the ball. Hopefully it will be released. You rest up, I'll come back soon. Wait. What are you looking at? Are you happy? All this is because of your brothers. You don't look so big now. There were emotions. I'm sure he will recover. Don't laugh. As I decided, so it will be. Even if I should put it in plaster. Maybe champagne and beaten eggs... Strength and more protein ... It's better this way, it's more powerful... So fast? - It was better if I didn't do it. - Why, what happened? - Did she refuse you? - No, he refused ... - He? Who? - The brain. - It wasn't the brain you has to use. - I know. Instead of helping me, it started hitting me in the head. I heard a voice saying: You are a mercenary, you have sold yourself... How? A young woman offers her beautiful body and you want to be paid for it? 'What kind of man are you?' said the brain. - I had a complex. - What complex? The man-whore complex. I feel like a prostitute. I can't get paid for it. What can we...? I'll make you an omelette, some refreshing pasta, perhaps... I even put the champagne on ice to celebrate... and you get all sophisticated before my daughter? What are you talking about? I'd eat her up, I love Katerina. - I'd do everything to make her happy... - Then try. - I Can't - Why not? I can't be a man-whore, I can't let women pay me. Well, with this man-whore complex ... Listen carefully. If your cheques give you scruples, I'll give them back, and you won't have a complex. It seems like a good idea. Yes, no cheques ... - perhaps I'll send them to the bank. - All of them? - All of them. - Will you ruin me? And leave me penniless? - Are you satisfied? - You cured my complex. Don't give me cheques, send them all away... I got rid of the complex, I return to Katerina ... My blood is in motion. I'm normal again ... - My brain has been unlocked. . - Think how ... - Baby ... - Katerina, have patience, let me force you... - Yes, kill me ... You'll feel like you never felt before in your entire life... They'll write about it in the newspapers... Katerina, my life ... I'm so excited... That's it... Kill me ... I'm not ready yet, but I feel new impulses... - What are you doing at the door? - Are you asking me? - What are you doing here? - I have done nothing... - Worse than the first time. - It's not the complex, you have a defective... It's in perfect working condition... - I doubt it. The complex was replaced with a concern. I feel my brain hitting me. A voice tells me: Now what? You're finished, you cannot pay the cheques. In love one doesn't think, that's why I fail with Katerina. - How acute you have it, my son ... - Yes, it's acute. In any case, I'm not up to it, let me go. - Please, I just can't. You are the only card up my sleeve and I intend to play it. - It's just a small card. - I'll make it an ace. - If you are a man ... - I hope you do not have any doubt about it. I want it to be so... Let's say that is enough for tonight. Let's go to bed. - Where are we going? - It does not matter. - In my room, can't you see? - I have to sleep in your room? - Yes, in my bed. - No, not in your bed. I don't want either, but I have to keep my eye on you. - You might try to escape. I can't do it, I'm a gentleman. I'm going to sleep in the wardrobe. - You've got a gun? It seems extreme. - Get in and shut up. - Is it loaded? - Of course it is. I'm suddenly sleepy... That's better. I care about you, Katerina ... I'm not interested in the inheritance I want you ... Only you. I'll make you a baby ... - Wake up, stupid. I should strangle you... You were dreaming of leaving Katerina pregnant. Confess. I was just sleeping.Are dreams not allowed? It's not the first time dreams may become reality. Where are you? Come here. I'll kill you... I'll be damned... - No. What's wrong? - I can't help it... - So you are normal? - Of course I am. - I told you, but you did not believe me. - Go to Katerina at once. I can't, if I'll fail a third time, she won't forgive me. - First I want to be sure. - More sure than this... Now I'm sure. Once I go there, I'll lose it... You're right, maybe you will not mind ... Try to sleep. You always put me to bed, I had an erotic dream ... What a dream ... No. I forbid you to tempt me. It's hard to resist the temptation of meat after a long breakfast ... I need to gain strength... I'm a bad mother... I would steal my child's sweets... What does it matter? It stays in the family ... Come ... - At least a little ... - Let me go. - You got money? - Of course, I found it. - Why are you angry? - Because it is easy to understand. If they find out I have no money, they cross sides to the enemy. - Tomorrow I go to the bank to make a withdrawal. - No more money in the house ... What can I do? Surrender? Help Katerina have a child? - Try and I'll take your life. - Then let me act. We need to talk quietly. Take the example of your sister. Come, my happiness, have something to eat. I'm not hungry. - If you don't, it'll be worst. - An empty stomach is not good ... - Anyway ... - A bit of marmalade? - Makes me sick. I do not like it. A little butter? Why do I need butter? Don't you understand I am in love with you? No butter, with jam and eggs, these issues are resolved. - How do you solve them? - I don't know. If you had a moral support ... Think you're a billionaire. I'm not materialistic. You'd rather my inheritance went to my brothers-in-law? - No. I can not afford it. - You want me to find another father? No, that neither. God forbid. Then make an effort, focus. - I'll kill myself... - We need a birth, not a death. - I want to cut all ... - Do not cut anything, I'll help you. - Relax. You'll see. - Everything is dead. - I told you I will help you. - How will you help me? Nothing can be done... I'll cut it off ... Figure that... Look what I found among my husband's books. Love in the pot. Erotic kitchen art. I looked through it. It seems certain foods are miracles. - I will cook for you. - If you insist, my love? Don't you understand? It's not about food. The problem is different. I know. We must try. I can not wait here like a guinea pig. What to do? - Take a hot bath. - It says it relaxes muscles. - It relaxes them? - Perhaps I'll have a boiling bath. - Do not exaggerate. - Pay attention to those outside. - Yes. They are alarming. Imagine that. It's soft and food makes it well ... These are the mysteries of human soul. Here they advise to cover the bed with sage, mint and basil. They exaggerate. You must make a child, not seasoned meat. Indians eat ram-testicles... ...fried in sweet milk. You think he's like that? How disgusting ... Carlo needs a little... help. - I felt him myself last night. - You felt what? Nothing. Only ... ...unable to speak to you ... he expressed himself to me... What do you mean? I have no doubt. He's all there. Do you understand? How could you? The bastard ... What are you thinking of? I restrained myself for your benefit. The poor man... He was very discouraged ... I brought you some food. No servants anymore, so I thought you'd enjoy... Thank you. You can leave. - Everything fell off, Katerina ... Nico is so kind... For Katerina it's something else... You mean this is for Katerina and nothing for me... If he stays, I leave. Stay here, I'll see Nico out. Be careful not to burn the thing. Nico, eat a carrot. Improves sight. Come out ... Tell me something, Nico. Much I wanted to ask you something. Are you in love with Katerina? What are you talking about, Ms Francesca? What questions are these? - Is it true or not? - I can not talk here ... - You must help me. - After you have offended her and humiliated her ... I didn't, it was my brother. I renounce the inheritance. I swear I'll betray Tano. If you help me marry Katerina, I'm willing to make her a child today. You're generous but we don't need it. - Katerina already has a child. - Whose? Want to know whose it is? Your late brother Salvatore's. It is impossible. My brother was impotent. - What are you talking about? - That you can't find a father. So what now? - I'm willing to make a big sacrifice. - To insult the honour of your brother. - Insult? I'll defend it... If you should have an heir it is better I do it. Everything stays in the family ... ... and the child will have the same blood. Bravo. You've shown your cards, Now I'll show mine. Show them, Ms Francesca. Katerina is disgusted by you, and I'll kick you out, but keep you as a backup. As the saying goes: Time solves all problems. Go and swim. I don't understand why there are so many problems providing several million. - My brother has made billions in the bank. - We inherit them. Unless a legitimate heir is born. My brother couldn't have heirs. Don't you trust my word of honour? The word of honour is true for the past, but for the present... ... it's enough for it to be conceived in the right time. You're ignoring my word of honour and only that. You validate my brother's future disgrace. You cannot let someone put the horns on my brother. I don't. But what do I write in the transcript? The late one was impotent and the widow is cheating on him now? I understood everything. No need for other explanations. You won't give me the money. I cannot. Trust me. Once we inherit, I'll fire him. I promise. Something happened. Your brother, Don Nico brought Mrs Francesca a box full of food. What's wrong with that? He's shopping so that they stay inside. Shut up. He could artificially inseminated her. I heard that they are syringes that are easy to use... - Who would use them? Nico? - This no, but he could ... There are syringes, but the seed has to be scientifically designed. If so, that means my brother could do it ... Who the hell gets all this? - Now, where is Nico? - He went home. He said he goes home to be rest for tonight. Here comes your beautiful Nico to love you in the castle... and we will make a beautiful child together ... In my brother's memory ... I'll always be with you... That would help me to digest ... I ate a lot ... I feel heavy... - So hot ... - It is very hot ... - It's hard ... - How hard ... How are you? - I have no strength ... - Weak ... - I think the time has come ... - What now? A shot of whiskey, it expands the stomach... - I'll drink everything... - I will keep you company, I'll drink too... - Mrs. Katerina does not drink? Is she anti-alcohol? - She's dry ... I'll toast with your mother ... Careful, the glass will break... A real pick-me-up. Yes, it's hard, I feel hot... Restless ... I feel distraught ... - You know Danuzio? - I met him in Africa. The wind begins to warm everything ... Listen ... Rain ... The sun is rising... ... I do not see anything if there's sun ... A glass ... - I love this whiskey ... - Another glass, to make you feel good ... You can unbutton... - Not like that, Carlutto ... - I'm unbuttoning... - Talking of Danuzio ... - I'll open them all ... I don't feel too well, I'll go wash up, then sleep. - Go to bed ... - ...In the room, of course ... - Naturally ... She opened my trousers with her foot... Feisty... I saw that. You, my mother, in front of me ... - You seduced him, you stole him from me... - What are you thinking of? - You should thank me. - The hell I should... I don't need your advances. What do you think, you'll give him to me after instruction? Of course. He will be a chief of the torpedo boat ... On the contrary, he'll be all yours. You're such a baby. You're jealous on your own mother ... - Then what? - It's simple. So drunk, stimulated, excited ... he'll believe that I will be in my room, but ... - But I'll. That's it. - Plants, peas, onions ... I even put Gerovital in his whiskey... Shortly after I stop the current ... in the dark, he'll go in the bed and find you. Believing that it's me... He'll start the work ... Leave him at it... You need to be mute. Be careful, he who sleeps doesn't catch the fish ... If he realises that it's me? If the fish is caught and it feels good, then he'll have got rid of the complex. You're right. Forgive me for distrusting you. I understand. I've been in love with a man once. Fortunately for your father ... else he got the horns... Hurry to bed you must not be late. Happiness of youth ... What grabbed me? I feel electrified ... fire ... tonight. Stop. - If the heir is born? - You're done for. - Don't you recognise me? - Where is Don Tano? My brother has other things to do, I'll deal with my sister-in-law tonight. - ... and I don't want to be bothered. - How so? You must stay on guard, I got the rest. - What are you doing, Anuzzo? - Freeze. - If the heir is born? - We're done for, I understand. - I have carrots. Want some? - Carrots? They are good for the sight. Eat. How do I look? Stylish? - Have you removed mourning? - You're right, I did not put it on. Carrots are great. It's good not to eat. They improve sight. I heard a suspicious noise. Go and check. I'll patrol here. - Do a round. Are you still here? - I did a round. - A round of inspection. - I understand. The lights are out... But I'll find you, don't worry... Where are you? I can't see. Where am I? I'll be damned. I banged my knee. How many seats are in the house? They have more seats than beds. Are you already here? You pretend to be asleep? What? First you start me up in front of you daughter... ... then pretend you are asleep? Tonight I will have no mercy. Tonight we must steal your daughter's sweets... I'm decided. Why don't you speak? No answer? Scared? You don't want Katerina to know ... I'll tell Katerina you're stealing her sweets... I'll tell her, I don't care what happens... I hope she understands, if she doesn't, let her have patience... I'll do it all my life ... Don't scream, or I'll scream to. I'll call Katerina, the guards, firemen, police... Don't scream. Shut up. You must be quiet. No love-making here. This is work for the happiness of Katerina. Be good, Katerina ... For me, you are Katerina. Like that, Katerina ... I love you, Katerina ... I did it. Blessed be the drink which strengthened the stick ... Now I can sleep peacefully. You made me so happy, baby. Sorry, Salvatore. Are you an idiot. It's me, Nico ... I'm here, Katerina. It was the mirror ... The bed is on the other side. I'm coming, Katerina ... Katerina, don't make a sound, they'll kill us both. If you knew how much I love you... Wait Katerina, I'm coming... How much I love ... It's going to be sweet. Don't move ... So soft... Why do you reject me, Katerina? Didn't mother tell you anything? I came for you, Katerina, to work together... I came here to help you ... You will be mine .... After that, I could kill myself... What do I care... ? Who dies for love has lived through all... - If the child pisses? - The cot is wet. - I never remember my password. - Did I win this idiot in a lottery? What are you doing? Your brother heard a suspicious noise and I was checking for an intruder. My brother is always confused. Where is he? There's someone Mrs Katerina's window. He's coming down. What luck. The plan succeeded. Nobody figured it out. Wait. Let's see who it is. Let's see who ... You? Where were you? - Up there. - Where? At the window? - At Katerina? Coward. - I was in control. - The best defence is attack. - What attack? I suspected someone was there and instead of doing nothing... - ...I went up to check, to probe ... - Only for that? To probe? - Well, since the ... - What have you found out? I understand that Ms Katerina's an extraordinary woman. It's wonderful. If you'd have probed her like I did... You wouldn't just keep guard here. I assure you. - So don't have to worry. - Of course not. All that remains is to wait for nine months. The heir is born... This is the advance. Sorry for the delay, but we must abide the law. - I understand. - Wait a moment. - Sign up for my receipt. - Finally I have found you Don Tano. - What? - We're done for. Why are you telling password? Excuse him, Mr. Director. He's stupid. It was you who told me. If the heir is born... - There need not, he won't be born. - Yes he was. - Who was born? - The heir. - In that case, you don't get anything. - It's a mistake. There may have been born ... Only if ... Nico ... I got Katerina pregnant... Tano ... You're killing me ... - Traitor! - Wait, Tano. - I'll kill you. Open up. - Wait. - What? I don't hear anything. - I want to explain. If you kill him, you go to prison ... Life in prison for a traitor of a brother. - Get out! - Wait, Tano. - I want to talk to you seriously. - They talk quietly. Don't hit me, Vincenza. - Are you kissing me? - I want to explain. This time, I will catch fire. Wait. - Whose is this son of a... - Mrs Katerina's. Have you seen how beautiful he is? Looks exactly like his father. Who's the father? I am the father. It's my son. He's all mine. - Yours? Can you confirm? What interest is it of yours, If my son's not Salvatore, the inheritance is not of Katerina's. It's ours. - Believe me. - Yes, it's true. We have clear evidence that he is a bastard son. What do you want? Why, Katerina? Are you not glad we came to congratulate you for our nephew? I had to tell him it's my child. - Yours? - That was born of our love. Are you insane? How dare you say such nonsense? Get out immediately. I understand. Needless to tell stories. We're in love. We'll be married, and my side of the inheritance will be yours too. You make me sick as always. That night, you spoke differently when you were holding me. - What ... ? - Why do you insist to deny everything? I have proof. No, I insist. If not, I'll sue you for slander. What evidence do you speak of? - If you have evidence, show it. - What you waiting for? - Show it. - I cannot show it. It's her. I did not want to reveal intimate things, but I saw moles... - There are three. - What moles? I do not have moles. - Yes you do. - No I don't. Do not tell lies. - Let's calm down. Show them to me. - I must look. - Me or you, it's the same thing. - I know where they are. What are you going to look for? Let me do it, I'm a woman. Look for yourself, Vincenza. Turn around, you pigs. Turn around and don't look. I can barely wait to look at her... - Do not look. - Are you sure she had moles? - I'm sure. Very much so. - I understand. You are sure ... - Anything? - There is no mole. - Where did you see them? - They must be there, look better. They're there, for sure. It was dark, but I touched them ... I kissed 'em... What have you kissed? What did you see? She sees nothing, you're wrong. How...? - Is he crying? - No, it's always the other one. Other? What other? - I swear, Tanuzzo ... - Speak. Only one ... Go, else I kill him ... I can't. Stop. - Whose is this son of ... - Mrs Francesca. Only one possible father... Look at him. He's got Don Nico's face. - Yes, there they are. - Now are you happy? - We're done for. Go and prepare documents, Nico. You have to marry me immediately. To marry you? My son must have a father even a rag of a father ... Of course ... Why the long face? Now it's Katerina's inheritance. You see, she'll be very generous. Hopefully ... Look at them, the miserable bastards... They left. Now Salvatore, are you convinced that I was right? You wanted a rich son. Those fools got their comeuppance. Look at the poor bastards... They left together... How nice to be reconciled... It's nice to see people living in harmony. No more worries for them. How do you say? It makes me laugh. It's so funny. - What? - What? Destiny. I came to rob you, you give me a son that's not mine, but your husband's. While your brother-in-law thinks he has a son with you, but it's with your mother. So, your brother-in-law becomes you son and you son's grandpa. And I become the widow of a paternal uncle who is father to your child. What a disaster ... - And what do you become? - The happiest man in the world. Does that have to stay here all the time? It's due to him, after all.
