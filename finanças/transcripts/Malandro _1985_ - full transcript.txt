Rio, December 7, 1941. The Brazilian government... backs Nazi Germany despite strong popular opposition. Right, Max? The girl's the killer? That was last week's film. This gangster... The detective is Humphrey Bogart? Tough, but a punk. He says he loves the blonde... but I think he's putting her on. Is it in focus? Shit! Spotted my jacket, dammit! The detective's Humphrey Bogart? The next one's an M-G-M musical. Peace, freedom and bread! It's this war! If we load their ships, it's collaboration. If we refuse, we're fired. It's tough. Last week there was no milk or bread. Jap! Japi! Japo! Nip! Hey Jap! Look what you did to me! - Chinese! I told you: Chinese! - Look at that! Don't make fun of me, Mr. Max! This piece of crap of yours spews grease! Do dry cleaners use grease? Calling me a mechanic? Look out! Some surprise, huh? You owed me for 5 months. We'll see tomorrow. Gimme $200 for this. 200? OK. 150. Make it snappy! I've an important meeting. I'm no Japanese, and I'm not crazy! Here's 100. Your a real pain! Penny-pincher! Hiro-hito! Nip! Now... the Hood is back on the street. Prancing on tiptoe, that's his way... trampling the hearts that he meets. Rolling out the cabarets. Between the dance steps and the body blows. Between the crapshot and the honchos. Between the con man and the main man. He finds his action where he can. A shack sometimes then easy street... the dust just settles at his feet. The street's a dance hall where they all come... cause the Hood's the king of the Slums. Good stuff! Money, guys. See that? No ink, but it writes. No kidding? Those gringos don't miss a trick. We interrupt our musical program for an urgent flash. Japanese planes have attacked... the American base at Pearl Harbor, in the Pacific. First reports say Pearl Harbor is in flames... and much of the U.S. fleet was destroyed in the harbor. We resume our musical program. Long live Brazil! Italian type, finished, fat... with a lecherous mouth... but a charmer, Margot! If the clients want a rumba... Ours is pure Bahiana. We are the muchachas of Copacabana. Our Cuban girls are all Brazilian. In a sombrero mexicana. We are the muchachas of Copacabana. Dear Mom, please excuse my handwriting and spelling mistakes. Warm regards from your girl life's a whirl... here in the capitol! I'm a star now international! Your girl in the capital, a star... international! If the gringo wants a fruit from the Amazon. We peel a cute Hawaiian banana. We are the muchachas of Copacabana. If he wants a sinner to join him for dinner... We've blonde Muslin mama. We are the muchachas of Copacabana. Dear Mom, nest month without fail there's a check in the mail... from your loving girl... life's a whirl in the capital... I'm a star international! Your girl in the capital, a star, international! Come on girls, curtain's going up! You're on next, Jenny so don't be late, please! Don't bug me, Maria! Don't tell me your faithful to Max! Do as I do Margot. I'm crazy about him too... but I'm always two-timing him. Soon I'll look like a Balzac character: all limp... and hungry. No Max, no horny Italian. Gentlemen and... gentlemen. Before presenting our next international attraction... I want to tell you... the dream I had last night. I dreamed Brazil entered the war... on the German side, of curse. The owner of this cabaret is named Otto Strüdell... and I'm no shrew! Well, then... the war was announced. They called up all Brazilians of the masculine sex. I decided at once. For a week I let my heard grow, used no rouge or lipstick. I put codfish in my armpits... and said to the sergeant in a loud voice: Heil Hitler! "Recruit Geni reporting for duty." He looked me over from head to foot and said: "Rejected!" "Why sweetie?" "Because you have flat feet, miss." I would now like... to drink to our beloved North American brothers... victims of a sneak Nazi-Fascist, attack. Shut-up, you crumb! And we, Brazilian democrats and patriots... support the Allies... and the crumb is that son-of-a-bitch! Your mother's the whore! Fascist bastard... you asked for it, you'll get it! If your always speaking... in big subtleties. In passwords and whispers. Outlaw strategies. The law will denounce you... there are ears everywhere... Even here in your own little lair. If your pockets are full of... black market junk... You're bumming your smokes, cause you're broke. What a pink! The law is observing... it sees through your lies... With it's x-ray eyes. In shadows and cellars... You make your retreat. Revolutions and robberies... you plan for the streets. By tomorrow morning... we'll sniff you out... with our bloodhound snout. If society in its piety wants you voided... recalled! Looks at you with scorn... You stand out in the crowd. You're vermin!... A tumor! You should never have been born. The law will throw the book at you. They'll nail you to the cross. The vulture's gain will be your loss. Brook 'em. Tramps and leftists. They're all going to jail. Let me go, man! I was just passing by! Hustling, eh? You could be a communist. No, not them. You're free, gents. Sorry to bother you. Lemme go, dammit! Life's funny, huh? 2 guys grow up together... same street... same school, soccer, religious, civic and moral education. One gets a degree. A lawman, respected. And the other? A nobody, an outcast. Come out of there! Take it easy, Tiger. Easy, big man! Don't use our old friendship to break the law. If I let you alone, they'll say I shut my eyes... - on a friend's guilt. - Me, guilty? Smuggling. That's big stuff! That's crazy! Hey, that's an antique, Sheriff! A museum piece. Don't tell me it still works! Know this one? Wow! Where's the papers? Receipt, customs slip, permit. Got you read-handed! Red-handed? No. It's a gift, Sheriff. You're the law, no? So find the papers. Listen, Tiger. About Margot. Don't be sore at me for double-crossing you. It wasn't until she got tired of you... that I stepped in. To hell with that woman! But how can she be happy with a mug like you? Why did she go? You want to know... And why did she decide to stay with me? I'd say that I don't know... And if she still has your address... and she ever thinks of you... I confess, I wonder too. Our nights of love all seem... a lover's shrine, a prayer, a dream... and the world goes away. With each other we stay. Hallucinations fill my nights... a paradise right inside of her. With other men she would pretend to feel... a passion she could fake, with me it didn't take that game. And before me she didn't know... just how far her love could go. Weren't you the one who had know... I've got my eye on you! That doesn't concern me, Dr. Tiger! I pay well to protect my house... and your men's help break up my cabaret? Hold the phone! Listen, girls, Otto's going to be your buddy. We'll split the damages. I'll take 60% of your pay. In 10 months I'll be paid off. But Mr. Strüdell... that'll be terrible... even for me, and I'm better paid. It'll ruin the others. I owe money everywhere. What can I do? I ain't been laid for 3 months! That's a good one! Is it Otto's fault it you lack sex appeal? Is he supposed to hustle for you? He sits there and slaves for you night and day. It's brain work... He's in misery from hemorrhoids. Isn't that enough? Dear, look what Tiger sent us! Come here, kid. Look! Can you imagine! What a wreck! Dr. Tiger, is this a joke? Is this your gift? Wait! - What's your name? - What? You have a name? Raimunda Dias, but they call me "Bag o' Bones"... Bag o' Bones! Born where? I was in jail, but I didn't do anything. Diseases? Syphilis, gonorrhea? I've already had all the diseases of this life... but I've forgotten their first names. Turn around slowly. If you would live off love... You must not give your love... You have to love... without love... without joy... always watching the clock. You'll feel the pain of love... if you would gain from love. A pain you don't need. You will bleed... and you'll sweat... like some guy on the docks... Aahh, love... It is no... happy ending. It goes... for the heart... Ripped apart... leaving nothing for mending... That is why you must realize... love is no recreation... Open your eyes. Love never was a vice. Love is a sacrifice. Love is a holy order... Light the little red lights. That is why... you must realize... Love is no recreation... Open your eyes... Love was never a vice. - Love is a good business deal... - A miracle! She's perfect! Go on, put her to work! Picking up these wretches... giving them new teeth... teaching them hygiene, art... giving them work... What do you get in return? Ingratitude! So if you think I exploit you... that the boss is always a louse... that the class struggle will save the proletariat... Very well! The doors are open! Mr. Strüdell, we're fine here. You're a good man, Mr. Strüdell. They're crying on a full belly. Max makes trouble, and we pay for it! When Max fucks you, you didn't bitch. Wait! Max? That gigolo! Did he bust up my club? He hangs out with gringos and talks politics. In my cabaret? Made an anti-German speech. His woman, Margot, asks for advances, scrounges... Isn't Margot your wife's names, Dr. Tiger? It says here: protected by the Inspector. You let your ex-wife soil your name with that bandit? Sorry, but that hooker won't work here anymore. Or anywhere else in this town! Lu! Your bags! Who's sentimental, I'm sentimental... Wearing my heart on my sleeve. It's beating, beating much more than a feeling... My head is reeling but it's natural... natural... It's August and I'm feeling lender. Waiting for someone of the opposite gender... opposite gender, someone! Just yesterday, life was nothing... My sky stripped of stars. Alone... Afraid... Could love improve me? Now I'm counting the stars... and my life seems to be a movie... Gemini, Gemini, Gemini season... It's my season, my year... And if it's not, I'll just die! Or would destiny lie? I'll just have to be... Please let me be... I will be happy... I will be happy... Let there be happy days... If the world disappears and I've never been happy once... Stop the marching troops... send them home until I have my chance... to be happy once! Take the warships apart. Stop the work on the docks... until I have been happy once! Bring them down, paralyze all the planes in the sky... It's important I'm happy once! I am sixteen years old now... I'm brunette and I'm pretty... and sentimental, sentimental, sentimental... Daddy! My dearest Daddy! You're so handsome, Daddy. We're in! That horse was a sure thing! He paid 40. - 40, chief? - Sure. - You leave the riffraff to me. - Easy money! Well, well! I don't believe it! Who do I see? Hi, Satyr of the poolroom. Look, It's big Max! How about a little game? A buck? I drop that on a pinball machine. We can do better than that. - Make it 10. - 10 bucks? OK. Good man! That's how I like 'em! You first. Look out Max! Here I go! So you really think you're the type... to be in high society... You let us know you'll stage a show... of souvenirs of "gringo"... You'll even lose some dough at bingo for charity. I just don't know... So now you say in English "5 o' clock very well, my friend".. The gang's confused... It's quite a shock, And they don't comprehend... We gossip, we slander, you're misunderstood... Oh! What a big hood you are! Are you making a Jake... Or should I be crying? I've seen your face before on a stamp... in the Royal Museum... the cemetery, the mausoleum, the country fair... Whenever you show up, you bring a meal. It's a big deal! A number... You make us laugh! You bring a band who plays the old time samba... We gossip... We slander... You're misunderstood. Oh! What a great big hood you are! You used to be a cool happy guy! You went and changed your name! And now you're talking big but you are still a fool. And you'll go hungry just the same. You'll see... no matter what... You'll be a worker yet! You wanna bet? I work at loving till I'm beat, and I die of the heat! A family man, a married hood, that's what we'll get! Oh you, you're such a crook who says... it's real love that you feel... Your big affair's a dime a dozen on the street... So what's the big deal?! Respect her... She's a working woman and she feeds me... Give her a break... she's done her time. - She nurses me, she really needs me - Her purse is empty, not a dime... - Your mother's walking the streets! - Since you never had a mother... I won't discuss her, I'm discreet! I won't even bloody my knife or start a battle here... Why not leave town! Just disappear! I won't throw in the towel... We're going to fight! Where will it end? - In the end pocket... - I just don't know... The gang is hanging 'round to place a bet... They want to see me fool you... You loose you cool, you start to sweat... when I pick up the pool cue... We gossip... We slander... You're misunderstood... Oh! What a big hood you are! In the pocket! - That's life! - Right, Max. I'll pay off with this lighter. It's worth more than 10 bucks. Do I look like a patsy? Let's see it. It's no good for a samba. My dough is tied up in a deal. I can't pay you a few days. I'm gonna do you a favor. I'll give you a week. One week! - Are you my shadow? - Take it easy, Max! Easy? The German played me a dirty trick. Firing the woman who keeps me! I'm demoralized. Don't make a big thing of it, Max. You're a drag! Lots of hookers dream of keeping you. But Margot's Margot, dammit! And that Nazi German son-of-a-bitch messes up my life! I'll wreck his house! Destroy it! Don't do anything dumb. He'll send you to jail! I'll kill the bastard! I have a better idea. Seen his daughter? - His daughter? - The apple of his eye. She's just come home from boarding school. If won't cost you anything to send her flowers... data her... take her for a boat ride... - I get it. - And toss her into the can! Not a bad idea. Or push her off Sugar-Loaf Mountain... No, I'll take her to deserted beach... fuck her and leave her there, naked. You're smart, Geni. How'd you know about the daughter? My 6th sense, Max. You're fabulous, kid! I may wind up marrying you. Don't say that, Max. Drives me crazy! Which of the two, Geni? What a chore! Excuse me. He's an ace! Terrific! Best striker in the world! Heleno, of course. Go, Heleno! What, Heleno! That's not Heleno, man! - Where's Heleno? - Plays with Botafogo. So who's playing here? Fluminense vs America. Heleno! Go, Heleno! It's not Heleno, miss. Go, America! America! Hurray for America! We're all Fluminense fans here. That's fascism! Where's free speech? Long live America! God save America! Shut up asshole! - Asshole? - Yeah, asshole! Don't you see there are young girls here? Sorry. They're idiots. You're very brave! We have an international call... for Captain Max Overseas. Captain Overseas. It's urgent, please. Captain! You forgot your cigarette case. Thanks a lot. Where's your friend? So plump, appealing. She stayed behind. She loves Soccer. Alone with those cannibals! It's dangerous! Don't worry. She's fine. But I don't feel to well. I need someone who can drive my car take me home. Your car? A dodge 'em car? Nasty man! I'm 18, OK? Here's my driver's license. Ludmila... Strüdell! Sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding. You think I'm a kid. I thought you were fat! No, that is... I was distracted... A business call from New York. It never ends... And you're no time to waste on babes. My name's Max. I need some fun. And your business? Business. New York. I've forgotten all about that. This your car? It's a beauty! Give me the keys. The sea's my element. When I have troubles, I come here. That's how my life has always been, high tide, low tide... high tide, low tide. What are these papers? Stocks, bonds. Listen, baby, last night these papers... were worth half a million dollars. Today, after that call from my partner on Wall Street... - Where'd he call from? - Wall Street. New York! He called me and said: "Max, our stocks aren't worth a dime now!" He was almost crying. Did I bat an eye? No way, baby! Industrial overproduction, see? No, I don't see. When factories overproduce, merchandise loses value... and you have to burn or scrap it to bring the price up. It's the law of supply and demand. I know that law. - You do? - Yes, I do. For example, suppose you interested me. I could make, eyes at you, and you'd think: "This girl's easy to get. She's worth nothing." Or I could go off and sit down alone... looking like a school teacher, and wait. Look at this woman you wish to seduce... after tonight... a memory you're rejecting... She's an actress, don't confuse... her kiss so full of passion... she's just projecting. Look at this woman you wish to seduce... she's all effect invented... by a playwright star of... "You'd never suspect". So when you kiss her on the lips... Thinking you've broken her defense... no mater where you put your hands... taking advantage of her sense... she is delirious... Like you are waltzing to a band... she even acts like your in love... Don't take her serious. What if this girl decides to see Japan... she leaves you behind... Her memory incessant... She's there when you turn out the lights... in the corner of your room... In the radio's glow she's phosphorescent. They play the last blues of the night... listen to the band forget, if you can... this woman you wish to seduce. Go for a swim? Not coming in? Oh, I see... No trunks. Just wear your shorts, dummy. So far the, war has gone Hitler's way... but this change radically. The United States is among the strongest of the nations... and they are ready to enter the war. Where have you been? - At the soccer match. - Did you hear? America declared war on the Axis! When Germany responds, it's called an aggressor! Germany is peace-loving it wouldn't hurt a fly... but it can't ignore a challenge. That Roosevelt is an idiot! Now the Third Reich will have to rule all of America! Gosh! Ludmila! I was at the soccer game with Fiorella, Mom. You say you're quitting school? The school doesn't want you! - I'll explain... - This explains everything. Your teacher's been kicked out of the corps of instructors. I don't know what that corps is, but this is bad. - I was going to tell you. - Tell me? Where did you learn such dirty things? It wasn't my fault, Mom. He deceived me. What are you two whispering about? The car, Daddy. It's so beautiful! I adore it, Daddy. You're a love! Nana lent it to me. - I see. - Remember Nana? I screwed her. She worked in the vaudeville theater She lives well. In the suburbs. She has a garden, with fruit trees. I wanted to bring you mangoes. Sure. But you don't like mangoes. Her husband earns steady pay at the City Hall. I see! I think Nana's happy. Wait for me at home! I've paid what I owed you. Hey boy, hold it! I haven't finished counting. Take it easy, Max! I was just kidding! Who's the "boy" now, asshole? - Me. - And the asshole, too! And the asshole, too. Take it easy! I'll give you some advice: Times have changed. Now there are only two ways. You want to be a big man, buy a gun and go into the slums. But if you want to stay here, follow my example... and get organized. Be careful with that dough. It's good money, woman's money. I'll return... No matter what, I will return. And when I left, I swore... no backward look that's what it look... A woman's empty words... I will return. It could be... I'll go from to bar to bar to bar... All nonsense to deceive myself... I'll steep with anyone the whole night through... I'll still love you. I'll arrive... at any hour, to my space... If any woman tries to make you... take you... take my place... you'd better send that tramp away. I'll return. I'll run back... and climb our stairs, our stairs, our stairs, our stairs... But then, my love I'll leave again... And addict who cannot go anywhere. I will return. If might be... our romance is... just a fairytale... And all the while... our roof, our street and all the town... of Rio... all fall down. It might be... It's gone! Our time together... Gone so soon... Springtime weather... Wait for me... Wait and see... I will return. Max, you still there? The film got a happy ending or not? Hello, handsome. I've looked all over town for you. So you hang around these dumps! I own property around here. Trifles, inherited from my grand-dad. I may demolish this, and build a skyscraper. You're not sore at me? The bit at the beach? I could tell from your face you'd do that. Why? To give you a reason to look for me. None of that! I came as a business woman. On a serious matter. Business woman? I see. Stop it. You know, Max? All I've thought of is what you said on the beach. Yesterday I dreamt of you again. About importing things... It'd be fascinating to bring here by ship... the most modern things in the world... the most sophisticated goods... Stop that, Max! Tell me the truth. Your business is bankrupt, right? Bankrupt? What nonsense, girl! Just temporary problems. I'm used to starting over from scratch. Nothing scares me. Nothing, huh? Nothing. Let me ask you something: would you like a partner? You? Instantly! I'm serious, Max. You and I will start an import business. Is it a deal? To get started... you think this is enough? - Otto Strüdell? - My Dad. I told him I was making a safe investment. You agree? It's not much, but to get started... I don't know, baby. Taking money from a woman... - bothers me. - Forget it... You'd given your word, but... I gave my world? You're sure? That's different. Sign the receipt. I'll till it in later. And us? I must go. You stay here with your grand-dad's inheritance. See you later! 'Bye, handsome! It's OK... It needs to be cleaned up, but it'll do. I hope it'll all fit in. Get ready, guys. From now on, We're in with the pros. It'll be fabulous! We're out of the small time. Wait, Max, I don't have a cent! Things are tough! - Who'll bankroll it? - I will, Max Overseas! It'll be a cinch for you. You'll hawk the merchandise and take your cut. OK? But if any of you want to be on the payroll... just tell the boss, and I'll think it over. No way, Max. That'd make it like work. - A bunch of junk... - What about the cops? I'll deal with the cops you, guys! Max is in tight with the law. Here, OK? It's a blackout! Smile, Margot, smile. You were always so cheerful! I dunno, Max. You're put me in a spot. Business is business! You said you'd do anything for me! You know I would. - Evening, Margot. - Evening. - You're lovely. - Thank you. Sheriff, I'm glad you accepted my invitation. I thought you were mad at me. Margot invited me. I was in a meeting, and Margot called... Excuse me. She's happy. You shouldn't put Margot in a spot. I wanted her to see we're still friends. What do you want? Ever see a prettier check? From Otto Strüdell! He doesn't know I'm daughter's partner. Lu's a clever girl. She'll go far! Not like her Dad, who pays you to let him exploit his whores. Don't say that! The check's just a start. Lu and I will bring the world to Rio. Even the Statue of Liberty! It'll all come here. With or without your help. You decide. Shut your eyes, like for her Dad, and you'll get 10%. Don't say that. This isn't the place... 10% of the world, Sheriff! - OK? - I'll think it over. May I have this dance? Losing your job's no fun. Mr. Strüdell doesn't like your husband, eh? Think so? I don't know why. But his daughter gets along fine with him. His daughter? What daughter? He never spoke of her? With me, that's all he talks of... That she's fabulous, they're talking business, of a company... That so? Is the German daughter pretty? Very pretty. And very young. Tell me the truth: you think no one hires me... because of Max? Of course! What if I wasn't with him anymore? Try it. You'll be besieged with offers. Think so? Think so? I swear it! You're the greatest! Where are you going, tramp? Me, a tramp? What am I doing with this two-timer? What about the German's daughter? She gives me money! I'm the one who gives you money. You used to! I'm going to be rich: you'll get it all back! No need, I know how to earn money! You're of work! You're old! I'll ball this whole city! Don't hit me! You'll ball who? - Pimp! - Whore! Careful, you'll ruin her! Get lost, assholes! It's your turn, Lu. Play for me, Fiorella. I'll put some hotels in your way. You taught me they all have to be the same color. The third is mine. But I'll give it to you. What? "Give" it? Nothing's free! Then swap it for my "Gas Company". - Thanks. - Give me 20.000. Alright. Look, Dad: three hotels! You can play, Dad. "Go to hospital". - He's cheating. - Hospital? That's my hotel. Pay up... 250.000. But I've got nothing left! I lost! I quit! Sure. Sell that junk. Mortgage your properties. While you're at it, sign this. That's how you play, Dad. That?... I need your guarantee to register my company. Mom, it's your turn, play! - What company? - An import company. That was in the game! What game, Dad? You even signed a check! Why are you so stubborn today. Sign! Please, Lu, don't confuse me. Overstrüdell import-export. Ltd. What's that? The company's name. Half my name, half my partner's. I need a partner. He has the foreign contacts. Wake up, Dona Victoria! Your partners name? My partner is Max Overseas. He's delightful. Right, Fiorella? - Is it my turn? - Know who her partner is? That outlaw, that smuggler... - You're a fossil, Dad! - Ludmila! You never got out of the last century! Your deals are going sour, your fortune is sinking... And when you die... what will I get? Cabarets and slums... that are falling apart. No, Dad. My life's ahead of me. Max is up-to-date, geared to the future. And there's already a lot of money invested. We're going to grow, grow and grow. Go up to your room at once! Tomorrow you return to boarding-school! - She won't go back there. - You too. A half breed! An illiterate trying to give orders. Did I take you of the bordello for that? But she can't stand that school! Then I'll send her to Austria. So she's in the right atmosphere. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? A touch up. Max something awful's happened... Dad wont's guarantee the registration of Overstrüdell. Not so loud! Guarantee what? Our company, Max. Without his guarantee, no license, no office... no working capitol. This is very complicated. Listen Lu... We can't talk here. Let's settle it tomorrow. It's a matter of life and death. It's not the end of the world. Everything's OK, the goods are here, our staff's at work... the cops are turning a blind eye... Don't fret about the company. That can wait. Max, you don't understand. Everything was done in the company's name. The money I borrowed, the receipts you signed. If there's no company, you can be arrested as a crook. Who me? A crook? What about you? I'm a minor. OK, so you are. I'll talk to my lawyers. Is that alright? Now, since you're a minor. Go on home. Go! I can't. - You can't? - I ran away from home. Don't talk nonsense, Lu. Go home! Daddy hit me. I'll never go back. That's stupid. - So what's next? - Next we get married. - We get what? - And today. Listen... For my Dad it must be a fait accompli. He won't have his son-in-law arrested! He'll have to accept it. He'll get used to it. Then he'll back us and our company will take off. On top of it. I love you and you love me. Right, Max? We could order a baby right away. That's enough, kid! Go play, and leave my man alone! Who's this woman? Your mother? I share his bed every night. Who are you? I'm the future Mrs. Overseas. You're a baby, a little slut! Get lost! Max, that woman insulted me. Dirty brat who's never bad an orgasm! - You're in menopause! - In what? Love, take me away from here. Don't touch my man! That man is mine. That man is mine. Oh... my love... has a touch that's gentle... all his own. A touch that drives me crazy... with kisses, that amaze me... and where his fingers trace... he always gives me shivers... So calmly... deeply... with control... His kisses touch my very soul the kisses he delivers. Oh... my love... has a touch that's gentle... all his own. He robs me of my senses... He violates defenses... naughty secret I must hear... he whispers in my ears. He bites me and he teases... with teeth my belly seizes... His marks don't disappear. I am his woman... understand? And he's my guy. My body is a testament to all he satisfies. Oh... my love... has a touch that's gentle... all his own... He leaves me in a frenzy... He strokes me and he sends me... when he forgets to shave... he leaves me chaffed and red... Each and every night we lie our bodies thigh to thigh... each time we go to bed... Oh... my love... has a touch so gentle... all his own. With foreplay that entrances... as he makes his advances my breasts... my belly... and every inch of me he roams I'm on fire! The reason is desire my body's his... and in me he is at home... I am his woman... understand? And he's my guy. My body is a testament to all he satisfies. - Well? - I want to talk to you. What do you want? Is it a message from Max? No, I came for reasons of my own. I called because I'm alone... I've been thinking... I want to come back, Tiger. Live with you again. Wonderful! "You want!" I don't get it. I made a mistake. I never should've left you. It was good with you. Why look for better. He was better? Don't put me on! Where's Max, eh? Where is he? The Max your jealous of no longer exists. The bastard I loved, that Max is dead. Now there's another Max... who's too big for his boots, an ambitious prick! He wants to screw everyone. You, anyone who's in his way. He wants to be Mr. Big. But I don't love him anymore. I see... Look at me, Tiger... See if I'm lying. I swear to you on everything sacred. That Max revolts me! What about me? - You? - Look at me! You love me? Tiger... For as long as I'm your woman, I'll respect you. - Inspector Tiger! - What a nice surprise. You have two hours to find my daughter! Ludmila has disappeared... apparently kidnapped by that criminal, Max Overseas! Who knows what horrors may happen! Excuse me, but there's no cause for alarm. I'm told Max has become an honest businessman. And I'm told that this smuggler... is paying you to cover for him. Whit all respect... you can't accuse me without proof! Listen to me, shitface! What proof did you need to arrest and massacre... so many wretches all these years? Electric shock, nails torn out, confessions extorted... How legal were they? You killed bandits and hid the corpses! You were well covered, huh! But sooner or later a guy like you... - becomes a handicap. - Please, sir... Don't forget I have powerful friends in high places... and that the government is anxious... to give the police a better public image! You've got me wrong... I know that crooked psycho cops like you... belong behind bars! You've been warned! I want my daughter, intact. Understand? As for your friend Max Overseas... well... you know better than I what to do with him. She's a lady! Know where we'll go for our honeymoon? To Hollywood, in style! You hoods are lucky! Damned lucky to be friends of Capt. Max Overseas! What a doll! Look at the fiancee! Lu, you're a honey! I always dreamed of marrying in a dress like this. This is my fiancee. Lu Strüdell... soon to be Mrs. Max Overseas... chief stockholder in our company. This is our staff. To me, we're one big family. - General! - Yes, Captain. General Electric, one of my rightest right hands. He'll handle radios, refrigerators, mixers... - Philip! - Sir. Philip Morris: American cigarettes, Cuban cigars. Johnny Walker, baby. He'll supply the nightclubs, casinos, smart bars... and the presidential palace. And now baby, the big surprise. They have prepared a tango in you honor. What fun! I want to see. Oh, if only I could sing... My tenor's voice would ring... A nightingale in song... And like a troubadour of sunsets on the shore... I'd sing in voice so strong... I'd gently say to you... Welcome... For I am singing of your beauty... You're a real princess such a cutie... a treasure in our den. Oh, if I were a PhD... So proud of my degree... Diploma in hand... Well in my cultured voice about you I'd rejoice... I'd talk in terms so grand. I'd gently say... Welcome... You are so lovely... Why be hasty... You're the first visitor who's tasty... to visit in our den. Oh, a waiter would be fine... With shoes that had a shine... A waiter trained in France... Who's never at a loss when asked about a sauce... and knows wine at a glance... I'd gently say to you... Welcome... You're so graceful. So petite too... You're so sexy... it's a treat to... have you in our den. Oh, if I could be Gardel... A tenor with degrees... A nightingale from France... A doctor of cuisine... A waiter Ivy-League... A football fancy pants... In fevered tones I'd say... Welcome... Your beauty almost is a crime... You have an ass that's too sublime... to be here in our den. - Big Ben, what time is it? - 3 P.M., Captain. Where's the best man? He's late! Mr. Justice of the peace, is all in order? - Yes. - Where's that best man? Tiger's here! Shut up, idiot! Stop shouting! The Sheriff is my best man. He's our guest. Welcome, best man! Best man my ass! This is the end of the line for you, lover! That any way to come to my wedding? Clowns! Is this a gag, Sheriff? My gun could hurt someone. The tigress is fierce today! I'm very scared! Faggot! Anyone else want to kid around? This town's grown too small... for the two of us Sebastian Pinto. Margot's free now. No she's not. - She's living with me. - That so? Another reason to get rid of you. You blind, Sheriff? Can't you see I'm marrying? I asked you as best man. My fiancee... the judge... Too late! I've been ordered to end this farce. The girl's going home and you to hell! OK, Sheriff, OK. You win. No use crying over my life. It's worthless. But what about all this merchandise? Tell you what we'll do. I'll go to Argentina. The guys will go on working normally. Lu... She'll go back to school. And you'll have 100% instead of 10%. 50% My part doesn't figure in this. 50%. 50 - 50. It's a good other, inspector. There, Sheriff. You keep it all, including Margot. And I disappear. You didn't have to do that! Ciao, kid! Congrats, Sheriff. You're the top man. What'll become of me now, Mom? Go to sleep dear. You're still a child. Someday you'll find a decent husband. I'll never find one like Max, Mom. I didn't have to explain things to him. He was always ahead of me. Poor guy... Who'll want to marry me with a huge belly? Why did you grow up, little Indian girl? So fast, so clumsy? You put on my make-up... used my dress... If I could I would turn back time... To relive the time I saw... Your shaking legs, little Indian girl... Banging your head... Getting all dirty... Not letting you sit on my lap... Make up for all those sleepless nigh, little Indian girl... To ignore your cries... and only take care of myself... Let the fever burn you up, little Indian girl... A high fever, chattering teeth... Dress you carelessly... To handle a dry nurse... Break your doll, little Indian girl... Shave your head... And show you off in the pubs... Turn the milk to olive oil... in the breast you dried up... Sprinkling shards of glass... one the floor where you crawled... for the lost umbilical cord... To keep you forever... in the darkness of my womb, little Indian girl... a place you... should never have left... FEBRUARY 15, 1942 Thanks. Mrs. Margot, the pianist will be a bit late. He went to the drugstore for sale cocaine. It's crazy! 5 grams of coke for the price of a beer! I don't snort anymore. Not even as a remedy. If by change you want me... I'm one of those women... who always say yes. Is it you? You're so pale! I'm no ghost. Well, yes. I'm dead. I'm in heaven. I cam down to see my friends. The widow doesn't seem inconsolable. Go away! Someone might come! - I'm waiting for someone. - You're crazy, Max! - Disappear! - I tried to disappear, Margot. I went to great lengths, I got a ticket to Buenos Aires. But I couldn't face it... I'd become a wreck... Life without you made no sense. I wish I heard that before... When you where going to marry the German's daughter. I was wrong Margot. I wanted to get out of this dump, become rich. I was a jerk. I hurt you. I ruined my life... I'd give anything to get you back. I was happy with you, doll. Terribly happy! I know I shouldn't talk about it. You've a good life. Don't right I come and cause trouble of you. Max, I love you. I'll always love you, no one but you! But it can't be. It's a rotten shame Go away! We must not ruin our lives! We can start over, far from here! You're crazy. Tiger will... - Hurry up, doll. - One minute. Don't move! I'll start with you, Sebastian Pinto! Wait, Tiger, I can explain... You wait you turn, bitch! You and your "I'll respect you..." - This time, too. - What do you mean? You'll lose this time, too! You're a born loser. Even if you kill me, you won't win. - Traitor! - Admit you always hated me. And I always won: soccer, biking jerking-off contests... Fifi, with the tiny cock... Watch that hand! Don't be afraid, Sheriff. I'm not armed. Then Fifi went off to Police Academy. He grew strong, killed thousands of people. Fifi became Tiger. And then what, Tiger? What good was it, since you're a born loser? Go on! For you... Catch Fifi! Asshole! Cuckold! That's for Geni! Now beat it, Fifi! Go on, you spineless bastard! Scram! You lost this time, too. Beat it, Sheriff! Sheriff of Shitville! Scram! Smash everything! Smash all this shit! We'll fix those Nazis! Nazis go home! Germans go home! Brazil is going to war! Smash everything! If war's declared to start right in the middle... of Carnival... It's our son's right! Who'd refuse the fight? Brazil's recruiting folks... It's a general call... If the world is threatened and we're in trouble... We'll explode and everything will fall Step up! Enlist on the double... Come on! Because the folks must save the carnival! Otto Strüdell! Don't just stand there, friend! Are you Brazilian or not? Death to the Nazis. Down with the Krauts! What a calamity, Margot. They sank out ships. I know... They killed lots of civilians, kids and all. Those Nazis are sons-of-a-bitches! We'll find a nice little farm, a quiet place... far from this whole mess. You go, Margot. I can't. I've brought everything, bags, money, clothes... No, it was a dream, baby, a dream. Brazil goes to war and Max flees to the countryside? Never! How could I look at myself in the mirror? And who'd you be sleeping with? A coward, a deserter? You talk nonsense! No, baby, I've decided. I have to go. I've volunteered. I want to be one of the first to parachute into Berlin. Don't look at me like that. I don't want you to suffer. I know it's dangerous. I may not come back. You who are a part of me... the half that's far from me... Don't stare at me in vain. Cause longing for you is a bloodletting... A longing far worse than the forgetting... Worse than self-inflicted pain. You who are a part of me... the exited heart of me... Leave without a trace. Longing's like... watching a ship... as it slowly begins its trip... leaving behind its mooring place. You who are a part of me... the part that's torn from me... The face I wear inside. It's no birth that this longing brings... It's like sorting the useless things... of a child who's died. You who are a part of me... the severed part of me... The part that cannot stay. This longing's a stabbing pain... that I feel but I can't explain... in a limb that's been torn away. You who are a part of me... I adore this part of me... Wash your image away. It's a punishment, longing so... I'll leave behind... when I go... the shroud of love... Farewell... Don't say a thing, sweet honey. Don't wait for me... Don't cry. Remember me as I always was... full of life, and madly in love with you! August 22. 1942 Brazil declares war on Hitler and threatens... to confiscate the property of all German residents. Rio society attended... the holy service that joined forever... Mr. Max Overseas and Miss Ludmila Esturgeon... Politicians, artists, in short the Rio in crowd... came to take a close look at the young marrieds... The groom heads an important firm... The bride is heiress to a Rio hotel empire. I saved your wealth by marrying your daughter. Dirty pimp! Smile, you German son-of-a-bitch! The young couple left for a honeymoon in the USA... Shall we go? Let's go, baby. *END*
