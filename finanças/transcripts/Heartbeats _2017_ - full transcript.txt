I could dance before I could walk Mom used to say. She'd especially remind me... ...when we were stuck in traffic driving to dance class. But my big brother Henry could always lighten the mood. He was going to be a lawyer, like Mom. He loved studying as much as I loved to dance. But late one night,... ...the phone rang at home... There had been an accident. And just like that... Henry was gone. Our family was never the same. All right. Five, six, seven, eight, and one, two, three, four. And then the roll off, roll off, roll off. Down. Kreation Krew? Are we ready? Yeah. We've just been waiting on you. Let's kill this. OK ladies, we all know why we're here. Dance Network's putting together a new show. And we're trying to spin people's heads around... ...with stories of dance. So now, why don't you spin our heads around?

We really liked your routine. We wanna have you back in two weeks... ...to try out with our live audience. - What? - What? For real? We made it? Hold up, hold up. I didn't promise you a trophy. I just said I like you. OK! All the network big wigs are gonna be there,... ...including Bobby himself. You wow'd me. You gotta wow them. Got it. So? Where's tonight's destination? - Skybar! - Skybar! All right, girls! All right, rehearsal tomorrow at eleven. We got a lot of work to do. I'm so excited! Look. We killed it. I've just got so much riding on this. I know. But it was really, really good! - OK? - OK. OK. - Who is it? - Kelli, it's us. Kelli? Hi. Hi. Are you going to invite us in? Sure. We were in the neighborhood...? From four hundred miles away? How was your study group? Kelli, we know. We know you haven't been going to school. Yeah, we also know that you took the tuition we gave you... ...to pay for this place. Mom, do you think I'm proud of this? Sneaking around? I don't know. But I thought you gave up dance. Dancing is the only thing that makes me feel alive. Can you make a living at it after thirty? I can choreograph. I can teach. Kelli! Teach? All right. You're coming with us to Harinder's wedding. I'm what? We're leaving tomorrow. His son's getting married. He's your business partner, not mine. Plus I can't go. I have a callback. It's a real shot at something. It's gonna wait. OK? We're going. This is very important for your father. Yeah, Kelli. Look, this could be fun. It would be a family trip. It's long overdue, don't you think? I'm tired of trying to hold this family together. So this is what a college tuition gets you? Nice. Don't know how you did it, though. I can't even keep a diary without Mom getting suspicious. That's because you buy those big pink diaries... ...with a lock and key on it. Right. This is discreet. He would have been a great lawyer. He could even out debate Mom. And you know what he'd say if he was here? That you're not him. And then he'd say,... ..."Stop pouting and pack your shit." "You just got a free trip to India, Bitch." I added that last part. Who are you calling a bitch? Bi-atch, I said! You're not allowed to cuss! Welcome to The Renaissance Hotel. - That's for you. - Harinder! So good to see you! Michelle. Thank you so much for coming. - Congratulations. - Thank you! Oh. Congratulate me when it's done. I am a wreck! These Indian weddings, an entire week they take. Well, we have drive-thru chapels in Vegas. Why didn't I think of that? It's so nice to see you, Kelli. - Hi, Kelli! - Hi. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Kelli?! - Oh, there she is! - Deepika! Hi. Papa didn't think you'd make it. Hey, Richard! Deepika is thrilled that you're here. Did you know her last two summers she visited Bombay? I think she likes it here. Only if she falls in love and gets married, too. We can be done with this wedding nonsense. - Mama! - Oh, come on. - Um, excuse me, Swati. - Yes, Doctor. Could you please have my friends checked in? And I'm gonna steal your daughter. One quick coffee for girl talk! That's good. Go on! Your mom looks so happy. Yeah. She is so thrilled... ...that my big brother is finally getting married. Now if she'll just stop nagging me. It's nice to have another American here. The bride's family all stay here in Bombay. Our parents conspired to bring them together. Conspired how? Well? They were on vacation together in Germany,... ...an introduction was made. Then they fell in love. I wonder what kinda guy my parents would pick for me... Wait, actually, no I don't! Indian weddings are a week of pageantry and celebration,... ...but don't worry, the real fun starts tomorrow... ...because the sangeet rehearsals begin. - Sangeet? - Mm hm! And bring your dancing shoes. I've choreographed a special piece just for you. Basu! - Aseem! - Finally! Let's go, we should go! Let's go! Basu! - What did you do? - I had to get my laptop! Basu! You just broke into the shop and took it? What could I do? We need it for tonight. We'll just pay him with whatever we make, yeah? Let's go! We rehearse for the week. This party is just the start. So are you really making a buck at choreography? Are you like a real choreographer? Do you work with Bieber? I have some pointers. That boy is out of control. Uh, well. I am not in that league. Not yet, anyways. And yeah, I mean, money comes in sometimes. Although I think I might have stuck my neck out,... ...bringing in my crew for this. Deepika? Excuse me. I'm really sorry. I don't know why he's not here yet. The crew's here! You guys aren't dressed yet? Naina! Nice to see you. I said 3:45, not 4:30. Oh. Uh, they're just... ...on Indian time. The only reason you guys are not fired yet is... ...because your father is paying me. Our tardiness would be my fault, ma'am. See, I was passing out food in the slums... ...when came up to me and he's like,... ..."Basu, we should go." "We can't be late. We mustn't be late!" But I sort of just kept ignoring him... ...and kept feeding those kids in the slums. I'm sorry. - Isn't he a charmer? - No. No, he is our motivational speaker. We all work twice as hard when he is around. That's true. Well? You guys know the drill. Show everyone a good time,... ...and remember this isn't a singles club. Now go get changed. - Aseem, seriously? - Don't. You've cost us enough time. On it! I'm just going to cue you when to play what. Ladies and Gentlemen! Let's give a big shout out to our honored bride and groom,... ...Kishore and Manjula! Come on, everybody! Yeah! Now... Let the party begin! Give it up one more time for the groom... ...and his gorgeous bride,... ...Kishore and Manjula! Come on! Congratulations, Kishore. Thank you. So... ...when is it your turn to get married? Everyone! Join in, please! Oh, you laugh, do you?! Now we're going to teach you some moves. Now we know there's Gangnam Style,... ...but we are gonna teach you... ...Bollywood Style! So come along! What? No! Ho ho ho! Papa!? Use your two left feet! Hey. You having fun? Look at Mom. What a dork. Your sister doesn't seem to mind. I'm sorry, Dad. I don't mean to let you down. It's not your job to hold this family together. I never wanted that for you. OK? OK. So what d'you say? Wanna take your old man out there for a couple spins? And have you dislocate a hip? Are you kidding me? Where do you think you got your dance skills from, huh? Not your mom! Right here. Come on. Let's hit this. Thank you very much. OK. - Honey, come on. Let's dance. - Oh, Come on. - I saw your moves out there. - Those are his moves. Well, show me some of yours. Just don't step on my feet. I believe it's your turn now. I'm just gonna watch for a little bit. One doesn't watch at the sangeet. One learns and then helps tell... ...the story of the bride and groom through dance. That's what the sangeet is about. Now we have one week to put this together,... ...so I suggest you join in unless... ...unless you are afraid. - Afraid? - Um-hm. Truth is, I saw you dance a few minutes ago and, uh,... ...it looked painful. If I promise to miss you, will you please go away? Did I hit a nerve? So what do I have to do? In this sangria "thing?" Um, sangeet. Exactly. Your side will represent the bride,... ...but you may lose the groom. You're probably right. I'm terrible. I'll cost us girls everything. Maybe you're not as bad as you think you are. Maybe this music is throwing off my mojo. Maybe the DJ is my friend. I can have him put on something else. Thanks,... ...but I said no. Look, if you don't want to do it, I get it. But there's gonna be an extra class... ...for the senior ladies tomorrow? You know, the ones with the bad knees,... ...tone deaf, absolutely no rhythm. You can join in. Or maybe,... ...maybe you really do just want to dance. ♪ Girl I don't know you but I think that I'm in love ♪ ♪ Looking your eyes I see your future for us ♪ ♪ It's like I feel you, girl, but we ain't ever touched, ♪ ♪ but I like what you doing to me ♪ ♪ Wanna get to know ya ♪ ♪ I've never seen no one like you before, yeah, ♪ ♪ Beautiful stranger ♪ ♪ I wanna dance with you, babe, ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Can I get to know ya ♪ ♪ I've never seen no one like you before, yeah ♪ ♪ Beautiful stranger ♪ ♪ I wanna move with you, babe ♪ ♪ Come bring your body close to me, baby, I'm yours ♪ ♪ Like we're alone out here running this dance floor ♪ ♪ I'll take my time with you cuz I ain't in a rush ♪ ♪ but if you want it fast I'll keep up ♪ ♪ Beautiful stranger ♪ - Change the music, now. - Yes, ma'am. ♪ Beautiful stranger ♪ I'm Aseem. - I'm Kelli. - I'm Richard,... ...Kelli's father. Ah. Nice to meet you, sir. Well, you managed to intimidate nearly everyone in the room. Don't worry, ma'am. My job is to un-intimidate them. Well, it looks like you've gotten everyone excited. You should go teach them some of those moves. Yeah. It was good to meet you all. Well, I see you got over your jet lag. Well, should we get a drink? Yes. That was awesome. Thanks. I took a Bollywood class once but it was nothing like that. And you guys killed it. Aw, thank you. Uh, Naina wants to see us now. OK. - Good night again. - Good night. Aseem and I met a couple of years ago. Our crew performs at a club on Thursday nights. It doesn't really pay much so he does weddings on the side. And I kind of help out while I'm here. Well, you glowed tonight. Dancing suits you, lady. Aw, you too. Thank you. - Anyways, I better go. - OK. - Good night. - Good night. Bye. Um, wait. This isn't what we agreed on. That's because you were late 10 percent less. That's bullshit! No. I'm sure Baba will under... Your father gave me a budget I cannot exceed. Now, you guys will be back tomorrow to teach lessons. Got it? We'll be there. Good. She probably keeps that 10 percent. Man... What? If I didn't get my laptop back, we would have no music, nothing. This is the only thing we have. Aseem, are you joking? These stupid weddings? Soon we'll be headlining at Big Crazy, man. Come on. We cannot mess this up. It's time we take a chance, and now. So we haven't taken a chance? Are you really saying that? It's all about you and it's all about your plans... ...because you always have one! But I'm tired of doing these stupid weddings, man,... ...and living hand-to-mouth. I want more,... ...and I know you do as well. Welcome to the Gateway of India. This monument was built as a welcome sign... ...to visitors when they first arrived,... ...and it was the last thing that they saw when they departed. So tell me, how did Columbus EVER get this mixed up with America? It's cool. Let's steal some of his moves. Fresh. Are you coming to rehearsal today for the sangeet? Mom can't groan too loudly... ...if it's part of the wedding, right? So, how are you really? I'm stressed. I have this callback, and I'm missing rehearsals,... ...and I'm trying to learn off a video. Is there anything I can do to help? I got it. Just take a big, happy selfie and say,... ...screw you, world, I'm having a good time. - That works. - OK. Come on, let's do this. Wait! Are those real Ray Bans? Only 4,000 rupees. That's like 70 bucks. That's not bad. Please... Always negotiate. - Walk away. - No! - Fifty bucks. - In U.S. dollars? Are you crazy? YES! YES! Dollars good, very good! Dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar. Very good, madam. Very good. Yes. Yes. Dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar. Maybe we should have walked away. - No. - No, no. Not good. Not good. No, no, no, no, no. Forty bucks. No mas. No mas! Deal. Look at her. She's a natural. I like this negotiating. I should do it back home at the mall. Guys, everyone,... ...usually at a sangeet, men and women,... ...they do this separately, right. But then again, where's the fun in that? Ya? So let's get together. Let's do this together, OK? Yeah! Our bride and groom... ...met when they were on vacation in Germany. The mother of the groom conspired with the mother of the bride. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six... - Beautiful. - ...seven, eight. Two, two, three, four, five, six... Papa Harinder pretended like... ...he knew nothing of what was going on,... ...though they had been friends for 20 years. Nice. Do it again. Boys? The mothers didn't want their children to know... ...this was an arrangement. It was just two families... ...with two children of marrying age,... ...who happened to be single... ...in the same romantic hotel in Berlin. Luckily for the conspiring parties,... ...the duo fell madly and deeply in love. Boys, make a circle. OK? Clockwise. Ladies, counter-clockwise,... ...opposite the flow of men. - The yin... - And the yang. Five, six, seven, eight. Very nice. You are in love,... ...confident, but shy. Women, you are a lady. You will not submit. You will be wooed! OK. Did you get married last year? Five, six, seven, eight. All the boys, behind me. Girls on that side. Come on. Time for your teachers to step away. Our groom seems to really like her. Why, jealous? You know, I think you should keep in the center. It really works. It sets them. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. - OK? Definitely. That was fun. I'll see you guys later. Kelli? You were fantastic. You learn choreography really quickly. Thanks. Look, come out with us tomorrow night? We're hitting Big Crazy. What's Big Crazy? Only the hottest club in Bombay. I'll put you on my guest list. - I don't know. - Look,... ...we could use your help. Come on. What do you say? Thanks, but... I don't think I can. 'Night guys. Good night, Deepika. Good night. Aseem, what are you doing? You could get fired. He just asked her to go to Big Crazy... ...and she said no. It's... One second. What just happened now at rehearsal? There was something different... ...and I know we both felt it. It's just, uh... You never look at me that way. I'm so sorry, Deepika. Oh, it's fine. I just don't want you to lose your job so... Be careful. Good night, guys. But not the red? Ma'am, traditionally it's the bride who wears red. And white is for mourning. And do I look happy to you? We have many colors to make you shine,... ...but you cannot overshadow the bride. Ladies, how go the saris? Dad, what are you wearing? Traditional Indian attire. - Pretty sexy, huh? - Yeah. - Excuse me, ma'am. - My turn. Oh, OK. That's yellow. Uh, do you have navy? It's a blue,... ...a wonderful deep blue. Save me. Your father has courage. Some call it that. So what color would you pick for me? I don't know. With your complexion,... ...maybe something purple. The fair-skinned white girl. In L.A., throw a rock in the air. You're the exotic one here. Are we OK? Aseem and I were just dancing. It didn't mean anything. Well, I think he likes you. That means something, right? Deepika, I'm sorry. Uh, you're leaving in a week. Please don't hurt him. He means too much to a lot of people. And, uh, yeah,... ...I think purple would look really pretty on you. And the van is picking us up at 7 AM sharp. And that's where they're also doing the Menhdi. Cool, the henna tattoos! You know, honey,... ...one of those would look really cute. Dad, Mom does not need a tramp stamp. - Excuse me? - A what? Ma'am? Oh, thank you so much. I had the concierge print it up. It is your next quarter's classes. Michelle, now? Yes, now. Mom. Look, it was not easy to convince the dean, trust me. But he's agreed to let you back in. There's no dance,... ...not one class. We're talking about your future, honey. You have a great mind and even the dean said... ...you have wonderful potential for law if you apply yourself. - Apply myself? - Um-hm. I've been trying to apply myself to something that I love. - Listen... - Hey, hey. Is everything OK here? Oh, yeah, no. We're good. We're perfect. We're perfect. We might have some dessert. Yeah. Here it is on Google! "The Big Crazy, there's nowhere in Mumbai..." "...where the dancing is more insane." I don't know. We have this early road trip thing. Look, girl,... ...put something sexy on... ...and go and show Mumbai what you were born to do. Plus,... ...our callback is after you get home. You need the practice. Basu! - Kelli. - Hey. You made it. I get the name now. Big Crazy indeed. - Isn't it quite crazy? Yeah. - Yeah. It's cool. Anyway, the crew's backstage. They're about to go on now so... Basu? Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend here? Uh, no. I'm Pallav,... ...the headliner here at Big Crazy. Welcome. He means they're headliners for now. He and Aseem have been saying that for the past six months... ...that they've worked here. Right? Correct. You see, when villagers move to Mumbai,... ...they get these delusions of grandeur. I guess that's the cue for the villager to play some music. Enjoy the show. Their routine's really very good. But if you stick around,... ...you'll learn how the real pros in Bombay do it. I'll take your word for it. - Hey, good luck. - Thanks. Are you ready? Big Crazy, are you ready to get crazy? Put your hands together. Scream your lungs out. Because something exciting that in the house! ♪ Whatever's done in the dark It will come to light ♪ ♪ It's written in the stars If you look to the sky ♪ ♪ Don't miss the, don't miss the, Don't miss the signs ♪ ♪ Open your, open your, Open your eyes ♪ ♪ Whatever your desire Bring it into life ♪ ♪ What's your intentions? ♪ ♪ What's your intentions? ♪ - What happened? - He jacked it somehow,... ...but it's working now so it's good.

Thank you. Aseem, that was fantastic! That's the best you've ever been, my boy. - Thank you. - And you know what? I can't recall the last time I saw that prick Pallav... ...with his jaw on the floor! Sweet. Hello. Hello! The name's Klaneh, like Kanye! Pleasure. When can you be back? Back? I need all of you, all of you, you, you, you, you,... ...and you, my ladies,... ...back here Saturday night, cause... ...you guys have got the weekend gig. - What? - Come on! Yes! Woo! Guys? Guys? Show me what you got. Show me what you got! Can you make Saturday night? Of course she can. What else is she doing? Guys, hello. The wedding's on Sunday. That's fine. We'll work around it. You know how big this is, guys? Work around it? Don't you think... ...we should at least talk about this? Talk, schmaulk, Deepika. I mean, every performer in Bombay wants... ...a weekend over here,... ...and we've got one! Yeah? No, but... I mean, we were great and all, but shit, I gotta go now. - What? - Why? - Now. - What's going on? See the guys over there? They want to kick my ass. I wanna kick his ass. You paid them back, right? Maybe. I mean, you may be mistaken. I'm sorry. I've gotta go. Bye. Basu? That's it. Basu! Basu, wait! I can't believe you! Are you getting in or not? Just go. I'll deal with you later. Go! I'm sorry you got caught up in all of that. Are you some kind of thug? I have mace. Basu owes that big guy some money. Basu's like my little brother. We both grew up in a village called Jalihal. Sure, we studied that in geography. You hungry? The best street food of Mumbai right here. I heard you're not supposed to eat the street meat. Ah, that's advisable. But my advice now overrules. How is your dance, my friend? - Already made the Mumbai movement? - Immediately, Mani! We ordered one vegetarian kebab and one paneer tikka. Your lady friend is quite interesting. What did he say? Uh, do not eat the street food. Deepika really likes you. I know. She and I have danced together since we were ten. Yeah. She's a wonderful woman. She's beautiful. She's funny. She'll make someone really happy someday. So why do some people call the city "Bombay"... ...and others "Mumbai?" The name changed in 1996,... ...for political reasons mainly. But some of the locals,... ...they can take quite a bit of time to catch up. I'm not offending anyone by saying Mumbai, am I? No. Old traditions die hard in India,... ...like the caste system. But young India... We know our traditions are out of date. But things are changing. We're changing. But yet we do things on Indian time. A little behind. So how'd you get into all this? My grandfather used to sing in the fields... ...when I was growing up. In Jalihal, just east of Texas. Exactly. We'd go watch Bollywood movies together... ...and I got hooked. I'd rehearse the steps, I'd learn them,... ...and then I'd make up my own. And then Basu,... ...he became my ear for music. And then one day we just... ...decided to pursue our dreams. What did your parents think? My mother never really recovered from... ...the complications of my birth. I'm sorry. I don't remember her that well,... ...at all in fact. My father though, I remember him. He was a good man. He worked hard,... ...but his heart never really... ...recovered from the loss of my mother. He never opened up to me either. But I had my grandparents. You don't let anything stop you. We can only control how we handle the things life throws at us. Right? - Good night. - Good night. Are you trying to get us evicted? To my lady love,... ...or the lack of. Almost got to my favorite part. Come on! Sleep it off. I need 50,000 rupees, Aseem. Where do I find that kind of money? It's the rickshaw. Give it back and be done with it. One does not return Rohit... ...his merchandise. No! Then sell it and give him the money. Look, Basu, this has gone on long enough, all right. You borrowed money for a business venture. It didn't work out. It's OK. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I will sell the rickshaw! And then when you and I,... ...when we book full time at Big Crazy... Rohit and I are done! Basu,... ...we have the sangeet in a few hours. Thank you. Ah, how could I forget about the sangeet? Isn't she beautiful? Do you think maybe we're wrong? Maybe she should be dancing. They're all so good, aren't they? Guys! Over here, quickly. First of all, great job today. Seriously amazing. Fantastic work, guys. Fantastic work, man! But we have to rehearse for Big Crazy. I know it's a tight schedule. I know it's a tight window. But we'll work around it, all right? And come prepared, everyone. We're doing this. We're doing this. - Yeah. - You guys, um,... ...I'm not going to Big Crazy. What? It's my brother's wedding. I'm his sister. I have like a million things to do. And you know my mom's gonna kill me... ...if I'm not here to help. I'm sorry. I can't make it. But you guys are gonna be great. Good luck. Deepika! Kelli? Let her go. But she's my friend. And mine, too. Look,... ...there's no easy segue to this. I'm just gonna go for it. I'm going to Jalihal to see my grandparents. It's just 45 kilometers east of here and... ...I'd really like for you to come. I'll get you back right after if you want. You can say no. I don't wanna say no. India's a big country,... ...but it's still mostly rural and farmland. A lot of people are leaving villages for the cities, for... ...better education, and better jobs,... ...mostly from the I.T. boom. But then wonderful places like this do exist... ...where change happens slowly. And that's a good thing. - Hi. - Hi. One selfie, please? OK. - Good? - Thanks. We don't get many international visitors here. Aseem! Wait a minute. Have you ever seen that little girl, Vidra? She is this small. You have a new motorcycle and a girlfriend! But nothing is more special than you. This is Kelli, from Los Angeles. And this is Vidra, my first girlfriend. - Ah, Hi, Vidra. - Hi. It's nice to meet you. Los Angeles? California. Hollywood? Come, come. Guys, this is Kelli! Kelli. My grandson is back! - Did he bring his wife? - Not his wife. He brought white people. This used to be Aseem's home. Mm. I slept in there for many years. How is Basu? I wish I could say he's grown up. Oh, they're being polite. That's why they're speaking in English. For ten years, I don't think my mom has even tried to... ...speak Spanish to our gardener. I'm not sure he understands a word she says either. Now you know why your azaleas die! And how is your dancing? We actually have a big performance... ...coming up on Saturday. And Kelli's helping out with it. So if all goes well,... ...we may be able to quit doing weddings altogether. I love weddings. I'm sure you do. I prefer sleep. When are you leaving? Monday. It's been a wonderful visit. Your country is beautiful. And you have a beautiful family. I like the spirit. She evokes memories of your mother. My brother Henry died five years ago. I'm sorry. I don't remember ever seeing him angry or upset. Except for maybe when I'd kick his ass. How did he die? Car accident. It took everything out of us. My parents, they've tried to hold it together ever since. My mom, she just wears this mask... ...that she's worn every day since the funeral. It hurts my dad too. I see it. It's like he lost her, too. Ever since he died, I... I've done everything that I can to take his place in my family,... ...including giving up dance to go to law school. But they must see how good you are. I was supposed to be enrolled at UCLA. I took the money that they gave me... ...for books and food and took dance classes. I was supposed to be in the dorm. I got an apartment. They found out last week and that's why I'm here. And when I go back, I go back to school. And where does dance fit in in all of this? Kelli? I don't mean to be disrespectful to your parents, but... ...it's your life. I just want them to be proud. How could they not be? - Hi. - Oh! Well, there she is, finally. - We need to talk. - Yeah, we do. Do you want to tell us where you've been? I went to see a village. It was amazing. It makes you realize all the things that... ...we take for granted back at home. Are you OK? I don't wanna go to law school. I knew it. I told you. I'm tired of lying. Well, there's a relief. All right. Maybe this isn't the right time. - We're all tired. - Then when is? Each day I don't tell you what I'm feeling is a lie... ...and I can't pretend anymore. Dad wants me happy. Of course he does. We both do. And he wants you happy. What does that mean? Look, it's not your choice on whether I dance or not. But it is your choice on how you're gonna... ...handle it if I do. - This is that boy, isn't it? - What? No. Need I remind you that everything you think you're feeling... ...right now is going to end when we leave? You don't hear a word I say! None of this is real. Real? It's as real as anything we do! Who are we kidding? Dad says this trip is for a family break? It's for you and him. He's tried Hawaii, the Caribbean, New York. Ever since Henry died, we're all hanging on by a thread! And you, Mom,... ...you walk around numb to the world with a fake smile on your face. But we know you, Mom. We know what you're really like,... ...and we just want you back. I miss you. And I miss Henry too. He'd never wanna see us like this. Please tell me you got that. Big Crazy's will have no option... ...but to give us the headliner spot. Come on! Let's go, guys. Good job, guys. That was intense. I told my parents I'm not gonna go to school unless I can dance. And how did they take it? My mom freaked out. My dad said nothing. And I feel guilty. Deepika hates me. My crew back at home are working without me. I come all this way... ...and I meet you. And I have to go back home on Monday. ♪ I don't wanna talk about it ♪ ♪ Nothing's making sense anymore ♪ ♪ I don't even wanna think about it ♪ ♪ All I really want to know is ♪ ♪ Can you make it go away? ♪ ♪ Can you hold me in your arms, baby ♪ ♪ I'm hoping you feel me when I say ♪ ♪ Turn the world off, I'm so lost ♪ ♪ I just wanna dance ♪ ♪ I just wanna dance with you ♪ ♪ I just wanna dance ♪ ♪ I just wanna dance ♪ ♪ Baby can we dance ♪ ♪ Baby turn the world off ♪ ♪ Show me how to get lost ♪ ♪ I just need to dance ♪ ♪ Don't let nothing come between us ♪ ♪ I don't care who sees us I just wanna dance ♪ ♪ I just wanna dance ♪ Richard?

Tell me, please, because I don't know. I really don't know anymore. You've been drinking. Yeah. Not enough to stop feeling. Kelli's right. And she was brave enough to say what we couldn't. Michelle,... ...we have two daughters... ...who love us... ...and need us. And I need you. I need you to be here. I am here, Richard. I am here. I came to India,... ...the other side of the world... ...for you. I'm doing my best. I'm here for my daughters too. I can't keep mourning our son. We can't. Look at us. We need to live our lives. Michelle? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Kelli? - Mo? What are you doing here? Something's happened with Mom and Dad. I've never seen them like this before. Baby, I'm sorry. We gotta get you back to the hotel. No! I don't wanna! I wanna be here with you! - We'll talk when I'm done, OK? - No. I'm not going. I must be crazy. Come on. Something happened with my parents. She's really upset. I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. Guys, you're supposed to be on stage in like ten minutes, yeah? E? E, can you watch her, please? No. I can't do that. No. I'll give you dance lessons, E. OK. But if boss man asks, I don't know who she is. It's OK. I trust him. Stay right with him, OK? Where'd she go? No idea, right? We'll see you guys in a bit, OK? Listen, she's gonna be OK. - OK. - We're gonna do this. - Yeah. - OK? - Yeah. - Let's do this. Morgen, stay right there. This has gone on long enough. Let's just finish it at last. Here I am. Do what you must. You wanna punch me? You wanna kick me? You wanna beat the crap out of me? Go for it. Do it. - I want DJ lessons. - You can't have DJ lessons. Wait, you want DJ lessons? Yes. I want you to teach me. So that's what this has been about? You think I'm happy dealing rickshaws? No! I look at what you do and I want to do it, too. If you teach me,... ...then I'll forgive your debt. How about that? Looks like you have a job on your hands, my friend. - Tuesday? - Tuesday it is! See you then. That's crazy. That's big crazy, man. So this is what the big time looks like, huh? Pathetic. You didn't think this was over, did you? So what now, a dance off? It's kind of cheesy, don't you think? I don't dance with slumdogs. Only you seem to enjoy it? You're an asshole. Morgen? Morgen? Kelli! - Morgen! - Kelli! Kelli, are you OK? Where'd she go? She was right here. Maybe she went out. This way. Morgen? Morgen! - Morgen? - Morgen! Morgen? Hey, hey, hey! Back off! Back off! Who started it? Who the hell threw the first punch? He did. You, calm the people down. Dance naked on the bar if you have to. Go! And you, I'm very disappointed in you, my boy. Please. - You blew... - My sister, she's lost! Look for the girl. Morgen! She's almost five feet tall. Your sister, how old was she? - She's twelve. - Kelli! Dad. Where's Morgen? She hasn't called. She hasn't texted? Where was she seen last? She was in the club, in the far back. She was underage in a club? That's a crime in my city. Officer,... ...could you just let them find the child first? We'll deal with that later. - Hi Mom! - Oh, my God. She was hiding in Klaneh's office. Are you OK? Are you hurt? No, I'm fine. But don't be mad at Kelli. It wasn't her fault. You! You brought them to this club. You should be ashamed of yourself. What, do you think you're gonna get a quick score... ...with a girl on vacation? - Dad! - Stay away from my daughter! - Dad, no! - Kelli, get in the car! I said get in the car. Now. You're right, sir. This was my fault, not Kelli's. Let's go. Thank you, Officer. Sorry for all the trouble. I'm gonna take a taxi back. Be careful, OK? You got fired from Big Crazy and I should fire you too! You do not take guests out and have them nearly arrested. Last night was my fault, ma'am. If you wanna fire someone, fire me. - Just don't fire or... - Look,... ...it was my fault. I took Kelli there and I knew her sister was gonna be there. But there's no reason for your family to suffer, sir. Let me make amends. Let's make this day as beautiful as we can for your son, sir. And you won't even have to pay us. Right. Wait. What? To honor the obligation, we will work for free. Harinder, may I call security? Yes, for this emergency? Aseem, have you lost your mind? Papa? If there is a problem,... ...any problem,... ...my brother knows someone who will hurt you. Yes, starting with me. And you are to stay away from that girl. Your reputation is shot as it is. Don't make things worse. Why get paid when you can work for free, right?

Congratulations. Your brother looked really happy. Thank you. I didn't see Aseem. Uh, yeah. He, um,... ...he left as soon as it was over. Good luck with everything. You too. It was really good to see you again. I know where he's gonna be tomorrow. In case you wanna say good-bye. Five, six, seven, eight! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Good job, guys. Very good. Good job. Good job. OK. Bye. See you guys. Bye. Have fun, guys. Neighborhood kids,... ...they come once a week. For a class I bet you don't even charge for. I should pay them. What time's your flight? In a few hours. I'm really sorry about everything. No, there's no need to be. I guess it's time for me to go home as well. What? I had a good run, Kelli. I got paid to dance in Bombay... ...for the three years that I was here. I mean, how many people can actually say that... ...they got paid to do what they love? What are you gonna do back in L.A.? Re-enroll in school. Finish law. And dance? I had a nice run, too. Rohit is driving me insane! He has no rhythm,... ...no beat, no sense of timing, nothing whatsoever. I should have like just kept running away from him. That would have been easier. What are you doing? What does it look like? I know advice from me isn't always the best. OK, perhaps it's never the best. OK, I know I suck at advice,... ...but I'm gonna offer you now some anyway. Aseem, you are crazy to give up. I have nothing to keep me in Bombay. Just forget Bombay for a moment. You need to be somewhere else, man. You can't let her get away. Are you insane? I have no money. I have no visa to travel. What's this? All my rickshaw driving wasn't for nothing, man. And we have friends with connections. Come on. This is a surprise. What, I can't visit my little girl? You want a coffee or a water... ...or one of my famous sweet grass shots? Uh, no. Thank you, though. This. What's wrong? Your mom and I are separating. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's, uh,... ...it's been a long time coming. I think we all know that. But yesterday we had a really great talk. And we both agreed... ...that if dancing's something you wanna do,... ...then you can do it, or not. Dad, we don't need to talk about it. You can't change who you are. And we don't want that, sweetheart. If dancing's something that you love,... ...it's the only thing you can do and be happy,... I mean truly happy,... ...then you need to dance. Our plane leaves tomorrow. My dad helped push the visa through. Our plane? You know, she's my friend, too. Oh, and pack lightly. I mean, the plane is gonna be full so... - What? - Hey, guys. What are we gonna say when we land over there? ♪ "Oh say can you see...!" ♪ Indian weddings, right? Why do they all have to end so dramatically? Got room for one more? - Kelli? - Kelli!

I'd have to echo the same thing. Individually you guys are amazing,... ...and Kelli, you're special. But... I mean I'm on the fence,... ...because what's the story? That is what we're looking for here... ...at Dance Network, stories of dance. If we give you another shot on the stage... What would you do? What story would you tell? Well, we could revamp our old routine. They've already seen it. Oh, what if we did that... What's going on...? I'd say a little chaos, panic,... ...and disorder are about to ensue. My kind of night. And Dad, I need a five spot. Make that a 5-0. - What? - Cash, Dad,... - ...cash. - Right. Right. Yes. See ya. Good luck. Hi, excuse me. Could you please play track number five urgently? And who are you again? Ah, that's a good question but... This is how we do it in America. Don't you know the guy from Daft Punk when you meet him? Do you guys have something for us? Otherwise, we need to move on. They have something. I know they do. Just one minute. How did he get in? What? What's going on? Hang on a sec. This is interesting. Thank you. All right, Morgen.
