(Running water) (Dog barking) (Agitated bird call) (Muffled yell) (Screaming) (Screams) (Screaming) (Shouts in Sioux) (Shouts in Sioux) (Yelling in Sioux) (Screaming and gunshots continue in distance) (Whistles) (Sioux) Take their horses and young squaws. Yellow Hands must leave here or we kill them all. (Talks in Sioux) (Shouting, hammering) Zenas! Zenas Morro! Viens ici. Les sauvages... They are coming. - Gryce. - Zenas. It's all over. Them Yellow Hands won't be bustin' up your traps no more. That Owl. Will he work for us? I don't know. He did a good job this time. Them that ain't dead's runnin'. Chemin, tell the chief that he'll be well rewarded for helping us out today. Tell him that we claim all these beaver creeks and Yellow Hand country by right of discovery. Tell him we'll buy the Yellow Hand squaws and use them around here for slaves. But put a mark on them so we can tell them from the Ricks. And tell Owl him and his Ricks can live outside the fort. We'll take care of them. I know that Hudson Bay Company - they'll be wantin' to move in on the territory, so you tell this savage son of a bitch we'll pay him to protect our trappers from all hostiles, red or white. You tell him we'll pay his Ricks with gold. (Chemin) They don't care about no gold. Then give them some whiskey. (Weeping and wailing) (Prays in Sioux) (Baby crying) (Sioux) We leave our blood on the sacred land. (Hunting horn) (Hounds barking) Here we are! Here we are!

Get me Denham. I see you've made your decision. Yes, Denham, I have. I'm going back. - How soon will you be leaving? - Soon. Right away. - How long will you be gone? - How long? - One year, and no more. - I understand. And, Denham, look after the place for me while I'm gone. I hope you find what you're looking for. Thank you. (Sioux) Shunkawakan greets the Yellow Hand people. (Voice echoes) (Sioux) A son of the Yellow Hands has returned. (Distant hammering) (Lord John) Hello there! Could you tell me who the proprietor of this residence is? What the hell is that? Could I come in, please? Thank you. Thank you. That's most civil of you. - Mon dieu! - Bonjour, monsieur. Comment ça va? I say, could you look at the foreleg of my horse? (Laughter) Blazing hot, the sun. I brought this for the rain, you know. My horse? Come on. Get up here. Hurry! See? The woman is ours. Absolutely not done, old boy. Not done. Get off of me! Gryce! Quiet! Are you going to waste your time with that? What an extraordinary beast. I'm so glad you stopped him. - Now, who in God's name are you? - I am doing a survey of the West. It appears your president - Jackson, I believe his name is - regards everything west of the Missouri as worthless. Two dollars, I believe, is all it's worth. - So William sent me for a look-see. - William? William who? The fourth, old boy. His Majesty. Our King. I do beg your pardon. My name is McClory, Seventh Duke of Kildare. And you? Morro. Zenas Morro. I run this place. Ah. And a jolly little fort it is, too. You're wrong, friend. This is a peaceful trading post. We're friendly to all trappers and Indians. How could you be so naive? There is no such thing as friendly natives. - I must move on. My horse? - (Blacksmith) Nothing wrong with it. Thank you, old boy. Maybe you ought to stay here for the night. Another time, old boy, another time. - Do you know the Hudson Bay Company? - No. - Are you sure? - Quite sure, old boy. Quite sure. Oh! By the by... As a matter of historical reference, what happened to that band of savages, the ones that were camped nearby? Something "Hands," they were called. - Yellow Hands. - Precisely. I knew it was some vulgar colour like that. They moved on. I was told that Indians never leave their sacred burial grounds. - Well, you were told wrong. - Oh, good. I did think it rather unhygienic to reside amidst one's decaying ancestors. You knew them, these Yellow Hands? - Come back here! - (Screaming and crying) Now, there's one of your Yellow Hands. Nothing but trouble. Open the gates! You know, fraternising sexually with a native is not done, old boy. In the best of circles, that is. Well, good luck with your little fort. Gryce, get your mind off that squaw. I want you to track that dandified son of a bitch. He's a spy for the Hudson's Bay Company. I swear it. He's not alone. Find out who's with him and how many. Then we'll send out a scalping party. Son of a bitch. He's alone. Hey. (Sioux) Go back, tell Zenas the Englishman is travelling alone. I will bring his scalp... Go! (Lord John whistles merrily) Get out of here... (Mumbles indistinctly) It's you. (Continues whistling) What the hell are you doing? Well, I'm not making a spot of tea, old boy. The Yellow Hands. Where are they? The Ricks massacred them. - And the survivors? - There wasn't any. Where are the survivors? There was a few women and kids. The Ricks slaved them and sold some to us. Where are they? What the hell difference does it make? They're gone! They're finished! Where are they? South... southeast! Into the Badlands! Now cut me loose! Come on! Cut it! (Yelping and gasping) (Lord John) Her name was Wi-Wacapi, by the way. The young girl you shot... in the back. You been here before. It means "Moonstar". I knew her when she was twelve. You'll never see any of your Yellow Hand friends alive. My Ricks will track you down wherever you go. Shunkawakan. (Sioux) Shunkawakan has returned. Come and greet Shunkawakan, he is one of us. Don't be afraid. Shunkawakan is a Yellow Hand. (Sioux) Chief Lame Wolf... Remember my son, Standing Bear? (Continues in Sioux) (Sioux) No horses... no buffalo... we eat our dogs. (Speaks Sioux) (Shouts in Sioux) (Sioux) I bring gifts for everyone. Great covering for head of great chief. (Shouts in Sioux) (Clamour of voices) Here. Here. (Lord John continues in Sioux) (lnaudible) (Sioux) For fighting. (Sioux) For hunting. For fighting. (Rattles) Raven. Morgan. Go, friend. There is nothing here for you. Go. (Speaks Sioux) (Old woman calls out in Sioux) (Sioux) Is it not a good omen that he returns? No! The evil spirit watches us... We offer the gifts to him! (Chants in Sioux) (Raven continues chanting) (Raven chanting and wailing) Sign say Yellow Hand spirit fly away. Lose sacred rock and old burial ground. Cannot go back. Have no place. Elk Woman, I have brought horses, guns. We'll hunt the buffalo again. We'll have meat, teepees, and a new life. Buffalo spirit gone. No hunt. Heart full of pain. Elk Woman... to give up hope is to die. We must wait for sign from evil spirit. There is no evil spirit, only evil men. Tomorrow, when the gifts I have brought for the people are returned, then the Yellow Hands will be strong again and destroy the enemy. You talk like white man, Shunkawakan. Guns no good against evil spirit. (Chanting and drumming) (Shouts in Sioux) (Boys shout) (Chanting and drumming stops) Everything is gone. Gone. Well, if everything is gone, then the evil spirit is satisfied and the Yellow Hands are free. (Speaks Sioux) He wants more? You've hidden everything, haven't you, Raven? You've hidden everything. Now, where are they? Where are they? Where are they? (Echoes) (Chants) - Everybody! - (Chanting and drumming resumes) Come up here and help me find the guns! Help me find the guns! (Shouts in Sioux) Elk Woman, help me! Talk to the people! Tell them! (Sioux) I have brought horses... we can hunt the buffalo again. (Sioux) You need the Buffalo Spirit to fight the men at the fort. Tell them, Elk Woman! They must fight back! They must! Or they will die! The people will die! Shunkawakan, why you come back? - You look for something? - Oh, yes. Look for something that I found when I was here before... the power of the great spirit. I tried to take it back with me to England, but when I got there, it left me. And now I'm lost. I'm lost. So I came back. I came back, only to find the people as broken... and as lost as I am. All waiting to die. - We wait for sign. - For what sign? For lightning to strike the fort? If evil spirit go away, Yellow Hand kill enemy. Go back to sacred land. Your enemies are not afraid of the evil spirit, Elk Woman. They've got guns, cannon, power. If Yellow Hands all die... that is way it will be. You're not afraid of death? Are you afraid to die? You have forgot much. Elk Woman... Help me. - Help me. - You must forget yourself. Fast four days and four nights. Purify your body. Seek your vision. You must suffer for the people. Then you will be reborn. (Chanting and drumming) I send my voice to the four corners of the universe, to the earth and sky and all that breathes and grows on the land and flies above it. In these things, your spirit lives. Send me the vision so I may earn the right to hold the sacred pipe... and through it, find the way. (lmagines piano recital) (Silent) (Panting and whimpering) This is the centre of the universe. It is a circle without beginning and without end. And in it you will find your own centre... where there is no future and no past. (Sioux chanting and drumming outside) The smoke from the sacred pipe, mixed with my breath, will rise and spread throughout the universe, and become one with the breath of the great spirit, who has now shown me the way. (Chanting and drumming resumes) (Drummer speaks Sioux) (Lord John) Oh, Wakhán Thánka, you see here a sacred place. You see here a sacred centre which we have fixed, and in which I shall suffer. O great spirit, on behalf of the people, I offer all my suffering. (Chanting) (Blows whistle) (Raven chants) (Blows whistle) (Sioux) Great Evil Spirit... free us! (Blows whistle) (Chanting, drumming and whistling continues) (Chanting and drumming) (Thunder) (Screaming) (Raven chanting) (Speaks Sioux) (Raven chanting) (Sioux) O Thunder God... Do not destroy the Yellow Hands. I give my life so the people may live! Stop! - My God. - Morgan. Morgan. (Mumbles in Sioux) Shh, Raven, Raven... (Whispering) Raven... the Yellow Hands have suffered enough. I understand now. (Sioux) My people are free. (Sioux) What you have done is sacred. You have suffered for your people. Now the Great Spirit is within us. We are reborn! (Distant animal groaning) (Yelling) (Shouts in Sioux) (Screams) (Rickaree whoops) (Children shouting) (Man yelling and grunting, children laughing) Buffalo give his spirit to our people. So the children can play at revenge? No. For fighting. We're too few, Elk Woman. We're too few. (Sioux) Like brothers we share the smoke of the sacred pipe. All the Lakota people are happy that our Yellow Hand brothers... again hunt the buffalo. Red Cloud, the Rickarees who now live near the fort... are strong and keep us from our land. You should fight to the death to keep your sacred land. Red Cloud... That is precisely why they're here. They want help to fight the white trapper. - White men of river? - Yes. Our brothers. Give us knives. Arrowhead. Take few furs. They give us gun. The white man has come to strip the land and to own it. Own land? How can land be owned? Can man own rock? Tree? Bird? Mountain? Own man's heart? Where the sun rises and the great rivers flow, I have seen land and all that grows there and lives on it owned by the white man. - You lie! - No! No, white man lies! You white man! You lie! White man of river our brothers. Red Cloud... He... He has come to ask for a few of your warriors because the Yellow Hands have not got enough men. Then let your women fight! - (Speaks Sioux) - (Laughter) (Sioux) We will do our own fighting. (Shouting and cheering) (Sioux) How many braves come to help us? (Sioux) None! (Sioux) We give you your life. Tell your people the Yellow Hands want to live in peace. (Speaks Sioux) (Children yelling) (Sioux) Now the Yellow Hands all die. (Whooping and yelling) (Sioux) Yellow Hands are gone! (Lord John yells) (Yelling) (Gunfire continues) (Calls out in Sioux) (Yells) (Gunshot) (Gunshot) (Lord John yells) (Shouts in Sioux) (Shouting and laughter) (They talk in Sioux) Well, it's better than nothing. (lnaudible) (Cheering and laughing) (lnaudible) (Cheering) (Woman makes bird call) (They talk in Sioux) (Rickaree guard shouts) (Chemin) Bonjour, Zenas. (Zenas) Chemin. Very good. I have a present for you, my little savage. Look, eh? Iron. Very valuable. I'll make you a bracelet. All right? Come here. All right. Good, huh? All right. (Hammering continues outside) Another one. Like it? (Children laughing outside) (Hammering continues) Ahhh... beautiful! You know, those Indians. Happy slaves. (Lord John, in Sioux) Take no chances... wait until the attack begins. (Woman, in Sioux) I understand. Well done. (Woman giggling) Come back here. You behave yourself. You know I love you. Come here. (Gunfire) (Gunfire continues, whooping) Everyone to their post! Be on the alert for attack! (Confused shouting) (Speaks Sioux) You dirty squaw. (Speaks Sioux) (She gasps) What in hell are you men doing there? Get away from there! Get to your posts! You, get! Load that cannon! Chemin! Why didn't you sound the alarm? Damn Yellow Hands! Where the hell did they come from? (Yells in Sioux) They're getting away! Fire! (Explosion) (Sioux) Stay out of the woods. It is a trap. (Zenas) What's going on down there? Those are Yellow Hand squaws. They're sneaking up on our Ricks. Come on, boy. Barricade that gate! Reload the cannon! Get up there! All right, get that cannon ready to fire. Attention! Over here! Another rider! Oh, no. Keep this loaded and firing. Give me a hand. You don't fool me! You want it all for yourself! Damn savages. Pagan filth! (Zenas screaming) - (Whooping) - Aya wakhan! - Aya wakhan! - Aya wakhan! (Laughs) (Chanting in Sioux) (Children laughing and yelling) (Chanting and singing) Subtitles by ECI ENHOH
