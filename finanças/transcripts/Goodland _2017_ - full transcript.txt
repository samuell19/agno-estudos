I hear there has been a wolf seen around here. Probably just a coyote George. Game warden says it's a wolf. Said he's seen the tracks himself. New game warden's a little green behind the ears if you ask me. He came by my place the other night, asked me if I'd seen a wolf. Tell him it was probably just a coyote. Twenty on pump one. - Is that all for ya? - Yes, sir. - Need a receipt? - No. Alright man. Have a good day. I told the game warden I hadn't seen any wolf. If I did, he wouldn't know about it. And he wouldn't have to worry about it either. Nobody's gonna worry about it anyway. on second thought, is there a place around here to stay? To stay? You mean like a motel? Yeah. Someplace fairly inexpensive. Quiet. Well, every place around here is pretty quiet, but the Empire is down the way. They're the cheapest in town. But you're gonna get what you pay for. The new outfit up there off the interstate's got a pool. The Empire, you say it's down that way? Yeah, you go out and take a right, go straight about half a mile, then you'll start seeing the signs. Thank you. I still think it's just a big coyote. Probably. Well, Dean... looks like you overcorrected this time. Now you're high. Alright, don't get your panties in a bunch. Oh shit. You boys having fun? Oh, just sighting in the new rifle Sheriff. I can see that. And that stop sign down at the corner, it wouldn't be newly perforated as a result now would it... Deputy? Well... uh... We just figured if it was already shot to shit, then maybe the kids in town wouldn't think they needed to do it. That makes about as much sense as anything that comes about as a result of your thought process. Hey, why don't you take that rifle of your and show this sorry excuse for a Deputy how it's really done. Not today. Deputy Francis, why don't you take the car back to town. Deputy Carr, you're with me. Is everything alright Sheriff? Game Warden's out at Chuck Barrett's place. Called in about an hour ago. Asked if we could keep it off the scanners for the time being. Doesn't want the whole town to know. So what exactly is it that... he doesn't want the whole town to know? Sounds like we got a body. See ya back at the shop. Somebody will be right with you. Ida, someone's at the desk. Can you take care of it? I'm in the middle of something. Get your ass out there, that's what I pay you for. ...number three is backed up. - Here. - She'll be with you momentarily. I'm sorry... I uh... Sorry I was just... Doing your makeup? What can I help you with? I need a room. Well, we've got plenty of those. Um... what brings you to the Empire? It came... highly recommended. Really? Cause the hotel off the interstate has a pool, you know. You know... I'm not much for swimming. Um... we have a single. Actually all we have are singles is that okay? I'm only one person. And your name? Ergo Reins. E-R-G-O. That's an unusual name. about as unusual as Ida. How did you know... I heard your boss. Right. It's my grandmother's name. my last name's Flowers. That one's my daddy's... Well, I bet it suits you better than it ever did him. So, how long will you be staying with us Mr. Reins? Five nights. It's just enough time to get comfortable. I hope not. Thanks Warden. So anyway, like I was saying, we finally went out the other night and we ended up at the dinner. You been there? They got new menus now. Anyway, so they got these new menus so I ask Sophie, I said, "How come you got new menus?" She said, "Well the prices went up so we had to get new menus". So then I thought, "Well, how come the prices went up"? And you know what she said when I asked her? - Hard saying. - She said prices went up because they had to pay for the new menus. Now, I'm not a smart man but... I didn't know there accusations. You know it. It doesn't make any sense at all, does it? Afternoon Chuck. Sheriff. Ugh, God. That's knock a buzzard off a shit wagon. Looking pretty stopped up here, Chuck. I don't have any idea what he was doing in my field, but if he didn't hear that combine coming down the row, he was probably in pretty bad shape to start with. He's dead. Sure about that Deputy? Oh, I'm pretty sure about that. Can't get much better than pretty sure. Got any idea who he might be? Well, that won't be too tough. That's that old boy we dropped off outside of town yesterday. Terence Valor. He drifted into town a couple days ago got drunk as a skunk and picked a fight with the Richter kid. So we... kept him in the drunk tank until was sobered up and we tried to help him on his way. Thanks to Chuck here, doesn't look like he made it too far. Am I gonna be in any trouble over this? I don't think you have anything to worry about. We'll just need a statement. And my machine... we got corn to cut. Not all of us are striking oil around here you know. I'll get Dale down here and see what he can do for ya. Oh, and... don't worry Chuck. Next time we'll make sure to deposit the riffraff on the other side of town. Apologize for the inconvenience. Oh, like it's my fault Chuck's combining up all the tourists. This is Sheriff Gaines calling in a 419, eight miles north of town. Oh, thank you. You're welcome dear. Looks like you got a classic. - Come again? - Your camera? Haven't seen one of those in a long time. Yeah. It's from a different time. A lot of things like that around here are. So, you'll fit right in. you heard the news this morning? No, I'd rather read the paper than hear it from you. Thank you. Wife seen Helen Barrett at church last night. Oh shit. Last time Helen Barrett was in church was down in the basement of an AA meeting. He's just trying to get a rise out of you, Don. She said Chuck hit something with the combine out north of town. Hit something? A body. There's not a whole lot left of your boy to examine. And the cause of death? Is that even a question? Well, it's not an answer. There's a very good chance that... he drank himself to death before the header even got to him. Have you sent away for the toxicology report? No, no one ordered one yet. There's no doubt he was drunk. Alcohol outweighs the stench of death on him. Is there something you're not telling me? Like how to do your job? Look, if you want me to dig deeper, I'll do what I can. A toxicology report's gonna take at least four to six weeks. Right. What are you thinking? I don't know yet. I ran him through the system and he had a hefty list of priors near Detroit. Charged but never convicted. From what I can gather he was let go on technicalities over a handful of times. Oh, I bet he'd take a being locked up over this. Any personal items recovered from the body? Not much. Just half a cell phone that's worse for wear. Alright. Send off for that report and keep me posted. Well, I thought that went well. Did you get Terrence Valor blackout drunk on your way out of town Mike? No, I did not. And after an alcohol related incident, we didn't send him out into the world with liquor on his person, did we? No, we certainly did not. So... short of coming five miles into town to get booze, which isn't even sold on Sundays in this town, and then back out eight miles to Barrett's place, this story of him getting piss drunk in a field by himself, doesn't add up. No, I guess it doesn't. What other options do we have? Good question. Guess I'll start in with Dan Richter first thing tomorrow morning. You see what you can find out about that cell phone. Okey-doke. Pull over there. Well, that's an interesting looking fella. Good afternoon. Afternoon officer. What you've got going on there? Just taking some photographs. I can see that. You're not from around here, are you? Stopped over for a few days as I pass through. Uh, Goodland's an odd choice for a stopover. What kind of work you into, if you don't mind me asking? I'm shooting for a book. Is that a picture book or a book-book? It's a book of photographs. Small town people and places mainly. Real Americana. Guess you came to the right place. My ex-husband used to always use those old disposable cameras. Still got a shoebox full of them somewhere undeveloped. Hard to find a place that'll do that kind of thing anymore. Probably wouldn't want to see what's on them even if I did. Mind if I take a look at some of your pictures? You know, just out of curiosity. Oh, like your husband I shoot on film. Black and white mainly. Ex-husband. I didn't even know they made those anymore. It's a dying art. Got this one from a secondhand store long time ago. Sheriff Gains by the way. - Georgette Gaines. - Ergo Reins. Ergo is it? Can't say I've ever heard that one before. Most people haven't. you staying out by the interstate? No, the Empire Motel. Can't stand the smell of chlorine. Well, Ergo Reins, I'll be looking forward to seeing you around town next couple of days. You take care now. Good idea, keeping the chain on. There's a lot of bad people in this town, I might be one of them. Something I can help you with? I was just wondering how you were enjoying your stay? You knock on all your patron's doors and ask them about their stay? I do. All two of you. Sometimes is hard to get around to everyone so I'm sorry for calling so late. Everything seems to be in order. Thanks for stopping by. What you got going on in there? Nothing, just some photo equipment. I've seen you around with your camera. You're not filming a dirty movie in here, are you? No. nothing like that. Oh. That's too bad. I was hoping for a little excitement. It's for developing photos. So basically shuts out all the light. Going to a party? No, just meeting some people. So, it turns the bathroom into a darkroom? Essentially. Now... If you'll excuse me. I've never seen one like that before. Been around a lot of photo equipment, have you? I took a class once. College elective? Yeah, something like that. If you don't mind I really do have to get back to work. Well, it seems like you could use a little help. No thanks. I'll be fine. Don't be silly. I'll help you and then I'll be out of your hair in no time. Come on. Don't be so stubborn. I'll tell you all of Goodland's dirty little secrets while we work. Keeping the night watch? Well, somebody's got to. If you're in here with me, you're not out there doing it. Deputy Francis is on duty tonight. That boy couldn't poor piss out of a boot if there were instructions printed on the heel. He means well. Hell, I mean well. Doesn't change the fact that I might shit the bed from time to time. Here. Got you something. When are you going to cut this shit out? You always said you wanted to read the classics. Yeah well... that was back when I thought there might actually be some meaning to all this. I know why you're here. I just handed it to ya. The real reason. I heard the call the other day. Just a drifter who... wondered into town and... showed up dead in a field. But... You don't believe that or you wouldn't be here bothering me. You act as if I don't come to see you three times a week as is. So, you keeping this all under wraps? Nothing to keep under wraps. Everybody knows what I know. So far it's... just a feeling. No point in getting everyone riled up over a feeling. Maybe yes. Maybe no. I'm just trying to do the right thing. The right thing. You can spend your whole life trying to do the right thing. Trying to stay in the light. But eventually... the sun sets, then it's all you can do just to... ride out the night. I've heard how flat it was out here, but... I had no idea. A man could watch his dog run away from home for three days. is that yours? What? That little anecdote. You come up with that yourself? No. I guess not. It's just something I heard my dad say once... We don't have to talk about it. Oh, no, I don't mind. It's just that he left... Really, let's not talk about it. How much longer you think this place will stay open? - What, the motel? - Aha. Well my manager Benny, he lives here so... I don't know. New hotel can't be too good for business. There was a time when all these rooms were full. Back before I worked here. When they found oil outside the town. All the drillers were coming in. and then harvest time came and the custom cutters got here, and there just wasn't enough room for everybody. So it kind of had to happen. Now everybody just... stays out there. I don't blame them. I would too. - Well, I better... - Wait. This is my favorite song. You have to dance with me. - No, I... - Oh, come on. Really I'm... no good. Fine. Then I'll dance. Come. Dance. With me. I'm sorry. Really I am. Oh shit. Leroy. Nine-sixteenths. Leroy! Goddammit! I said nine-sixteenths not five-eighths... Been twenty years or more since I worked in my dad's garage. Must be a little rusty. Nice story. What are you doing here? Maybe I'm here to get my truck fixed. - But you're not. - You're right. I'm not. Been hunting lately Dan? I don't hunt. Really? Hmm. Not even... wayward drifters who may or may not have had a problem with the way your face is arranged? Come on. That's not mine. That's good news. Seeing as how possession of a firearm would be a violation of your parole. Seriously, what do you want from me? Man, you gonna arrest me on that shit, you need a warrant just to be here, right? I wanna know if you had anything to do with that man's death. What I heard is your man went head to head with the combine. Now I ain't been driving no combines, if that's what you're asking. I'm just exploring all the possibilities. He got what he deserved if you ask me. But I didn't touch him. Look, we had words at the bar, yes. Then he was the one that hauled off and started punching me right in the fucking face. I went down and that was it. He's lucky that your boy Francis was there because that whole bar would have kicked his ass if I just said so. And that's all that happened? You wouldn't have happened to follow up with him once he was let out? I'm fucking positive. Left early the next morning for a salvage run you can ask Leroy, wherever the hell he is. Did he talk to anyone else while he was there? How should I know that? When I got there he was down at the end of the bar just drinking by himself. He wasn't talking to nobody. Was just him and that big fucking camping bag of his. Alright. Well thank you for your... superb cooperation Mr. Richter. I'll be taking this with me. I would hate for a law enforcement officer to saunter in and happen to see it just lying around. It not being your and all. You can see how that would be confusing. Oh, and... It's in your best interest to stick around for a couple of weeks. Wouldn't look too good if you were to skip town right now you know? Whatever. Mike. Valor had a bag when you dropped him off, right? But it wasn't recovered in the field. We need to find that bag. No camera today. Oh no. Not today. Just have to run a few errands. Delivery. 1926 Main Street. Half-a-dozen roses. No vase. Reins... Ergo. Shit. Don't move. I said don't move asshole. Put your hands up. This girl... this girl in these photos is sixteen. Now, I don't know who you are, but I'm about ready... what the hell do you think you're doing? I was... I was just trying to scare you away from her. Whatever you've been told, whatever you think you've seen in these photographs, I'm not interested in your little girlfriend. Okay? Don't come around here again kid. You're only gonna get yourself hurt. Ergo. Is every... You sixteen? You don't think that would be nice to know. I thought you knew. I thought you could tell. You thought I could tell? No never mind. It doesn't matter anyway because nothing happened between us, but how do you explain these? You know what? Save it. Alright. Your boyfriend just pulled a gun on me in the parking lot. - I... I... - Don't. Stay away from me. I don't want to see you anywhere near my room or my things again. Alright? I mean it Ida. And you're sure he didn't have this bottle? I'm positive. Look, we've been over this before. Maybe... Maybe he had it stashed someplace out there. I suppose it's possible. Well everything else is here. We're not missing anything. Well I don't think anyone except the coyote was chomping at the bit to get to Terrence Valor's claim to his world. Nice car. Someone helped to get him drunk though. Alright, so let's say someone did get him drunk. Who? I've never been one for conspiracy theories, Mike. Well, today might be a good day to get one started. All I can think of is that he knew someone around here. Someone he trusted. hey, I know you. No, I don't think so. I do. You're that a... you're that stranger that's been going round taking pictures and shit. News travels fast. So why are you taking all these pictures, huh? Is it like... Like look at these small-town country idiots. See how they live. Is that it? It's a... it's for a book. No shit. What kind of book? Don't worry, it's a picture book even you can read it. What did you say to me? Look... Can I just drink alone like the rest of the alcoholics in this bar? What's your name, man? Ergo. Air what? Er-go. It's Latin for therefore. I got it, so... so 'cause your name's in some other form of speech, therefore you think you're better than me. No. more like I'm not in the mood therefore you should back the fuck off. Don't move another step. That's a hell of a greeting. Why don't ya put that gun down quit fucking around. Grab everything you have for the job, we're going to meet Guy. What the fuck was that back at the bar? - It was nothing. - Nothing? Not doing a very good job of keeping a low profile. I can take care of myself. Just like your buddy Valor? Why did it take you two days to contact me after one of our men turns up dead in a field? What did you want me to do about it? We adapt. We're moving forward. Moving forward? What if someone is on to us? For all we know our cover is blown. Nobody is going to make a connection between a photographer and custom cutters. Look, it doesn't matter alright? The whole job needs to be put on hold. Does El Charro know? Look... you're new. Maybe you're not clear on how things work on these operations. El Charro contacts me, not you, and never the other way around. So he doesn't know that we're one man down? We're doing this without Valor. It's as simple as that. Valor brought me in, alright? I don't even know if I can trust you. This was a four person job for a reason. And I'm also in charge for a reason. And if you have a problem with that, or the way I run things, this is your one and only chance to walk away. Yeah. That's what I thought. You continue to do your job and let me worry about the rest. You got it? - Got it? - Yeah. I got it. Here. There's three numbers on that phone. I'm listed as number one, Kilmer's two, Valor was three. You keep doing your thing and wait for a call. Careful, it's hot. you know somewhere along the line I got it in my head that that real men drink their whiskey straight and their coffee black. Don't know where I came to that conclusion. Well, I guess that makes you more of a man than me then. Now... What's that mean when you were pouring whiskey in your coffee every morning then? I'm just honest enough to admit that without sugar this shit tastes like burnt asshole. Hmm. So, what you got for me? Not a thing that would make anyone think this is something more than it appears to be. Nothing makes a whole lot of sense at the moment. If life made any sense, I'd be dead and you'd have to find somebody else to harass. You're the one who's asking all the questions. Might as well be talking to the fence post for all the answers you got for me. But you won't let me alone and I can't stand talking about the weather with you anymore so I talk about this. Got the Feds involved yet? No. I don't know what I'd tell them at this point. Just as well. They'd only come riding in here with dicks out looking for a measuring contest. Got any leads? Talked to the Richter kid. He and Valor got in a scuffle down at the bar before he turned up dead. Henry Richter's boy? Hmm. Valor's got more guts than a slaughterhouse picking a fight with the local kid in that bar. It doesn't matter, Richter's alibi checks out. Ah hell, let me guess... church. he was out of town on a salvage. Any hard evidence? Working on the cell phone. It was all but destroyed in the accident. He had a pack on him, coyotes strung out all the contents, but we were able to recover everything, including a bottle of whiskey that he had somehow acquired from the time we dropped him off to the time he turned up dead. Well, this will come as no surprise to you, but... Whiskey is not all that difficult to get in these parts. Anyone new on the scene? Harvest crews are in town. And then there's the oil boys of course, and... And? Hal, why would someone stay at the old Empire Motel these days? Empire? I didn't even know that place was still a business. Well, you'd have to have an affinity for peeled wallpaper and the smell of piss I guess. Or you want privacy. Yeah. Be right there. Vern told me that four of these phones were purchased on the same day, all prepaid and in cash. And there's no way of tracing them. They're burners. If there's anything to learn, it will be on Valor's SIM card. Did I tell you our photographer friend is from Michigan. Can't say that you did, but... So why is that important now? Valor's priors were all acquired in Detroit. So, you think they're linked? And then there's this. I told you, that's a really nice car. We got that Francis. It's not what's in the photo. It's the photo itself. Black and white. Film stock. Real Americana. There are three numbers saved on here, but there are no names. They're saved as one, two and three. So, let's call them. And say what if they answer? Good evening, you or someone you know wouldn't happen to be involved in the death of Terrence Valor would you? Look, I don't know what to say but if you have a better idea we need to hear it and we need to hear it now. If one of these numbers is Reins, we need to see the phone, see it ring. We need to be there for it. Better be on time tomorrow morning. And drop the attitude or you won't have a job to bitch about. - Ida. - Don't. feel sorry for me. I don't need your pity. - Ida, I know that... - Don't, okay? You've made it very clear how you feel about me. Ida, you're just a kid. Don't patronize me. You don't know what I've been through and besides age is just a... what? A number? No. Age is... deliberate accumulation of experience. Great. Well, then I've been deliberately fucking up my life for a while now. Look. Who you are now, and who you become, they don't have to be the same. You don't know anything about me. You're right. I don't. and you don't know anything about me either. But you still... threw yourself at me like I was what, gonna save you from this place? Is that what you thought? I really liked you. You realize how immature that sounds? I felt it from you too. The way you talked to me. The way you watched me. The way you kissed me. My father left me when I was young too. I only have a single memory of him, and even that, I wonder if I'm not just... piecing together old stories I've heard filling the rest with what I've seen in old photographs. I remember him taking a picture of me and my mother. Even though he's not in the picture, it's what I have to remember him by. My camera, his camera, and that photo, all that's left. Everything else is gone. Don't allow yourself to be defined by those who leave. Including me. Evening Kathy. Sure is getting cold out there. Hey Georgette. Can I get you something? Coffee maybe? That'd be fine. Better make it strong. Mind if I join ya? Guess not. Late night? About to ask you the same thing, Sheriff. You enjoying your stay in Goodland? It's not bad. Thank you, Kathy. You know it's truly fascinating work you do. This town's not used to having an artist like yourself in its midst. I wouldn't call myself an artist. Something on your mind Sheriff? You know, I just got to thinking and I can't help but wonder if what you're doing is really all that positive for this community. Why would you think that? I'm just not sure an outsider, like yourself, can really give a place like this an honest shake. All I can do is try. I guess you're right. Fifteen minutes. That's how long a break I get from my patrol. That's it. Can you believe that? Crime doesn't sleep, not even in Goodland? Well... it's no Detroit. You wouldn't happen to have the time, would ya? Sorry. Dead. You know, the rest of the town hasn't caught on quite yet, but I'm afraid it'll be too late before they do. Caught onto what? Just the fact that you plan to portray our little town as... backwards. That hasn't been my experience at all Sheriff. You sure you're not projecting? What do you know about Terrence Valor? The uh... drifter who turned up dead? Yeah. Him. Nothing, except for what I hear around here. Why? You implying something? Look at it from my perspective. It's a pretty big coincidence that Valor winds up dead around the same time you happen to roll into town, don't you think? No, not at all. Everyone around here's convinced that he was just a drunk that happened to have an unfortunate run-in with some heavy machinery. Probably cause that's what you've been telling them. I'm beginning to think there's more to it than that. Like what? I was hoping you might be the one to enlighten me. You accusing me of something, Sheriff? Not yet. Good. In that case I'll be on my way. Get some sleep Sheriff. Looks like you need it. So, you do know it's the middle of the night, right? I mean, what could possibly... It's okay Georgette. You've been through a hell of a lot the past couple days. I didn't drink it Mike. Not that I... didn't want to. I told myself I'd just have one drink. I thought... it'll help me sleep. It'll help me let go of this whole thing. You know what stopped me? No. Smell it. What? Go on. Smell it. Smells like syrup. And when has twelve dollar whiskey ever smelled like syrup? Dammit, Georgette. I don't know. I don't drink this stuff. It doesn't. That's a very unique smell and I'd know it anywhere. It's antifreeze. What? I think Valor was poisoned. Goddamn son of a bitch! Um. Just give me a minute. Empire. How can I help you? Politicians. Should be shot. All of them. Sorry about that. Good help's hard to come by apparently. What can I do ya for? Just want to let you know I'll be checking out tomorrow. Early. Alright. Is that all? I guess so. Yeah. Get to the location. Guy and I'll be waiting. I'll be there. We need to get a sample to a lab as soon as possible. It may not show up on the tox report. - Sheriff? - And we need to make sure Reins doesn't leave town. If he does, we may have to get the state police involved early. Linking him to these phones is still our best bet. - Sheriff, phone. - Dammit, Francis, can you not see we're in the middle of something? It's the principal of the school. You're gonna want to take this one. Trust me. Sheriff Gaines. So, it's just like I said. There are four cameras and the vault is here. The cameras are here... here... here... and there. So favor your right and keep your head down. There's no security really to speak of, most of the employees are women, but there is a male bank manager, so be on the lookout for a hero type. He might think he's a shepherd protecting his flock. Other than that, it's just like we discussed, but adjusted for Valor's absence. I prioritized the top two banks with the most oil money going through. We're still hitting all three. What? You're going to take one. That wasn't part of the plan. You know the layouts better than any of us. Look, I'm just here to recover intel and distract cops long enough for you to do your thing. I'm no stickup man. The plan was to hit all three banks at once, and that's exactly what we're gonna do. And what if I say no? You had your chance to walk, and I warned you it would be your last. You're threatening me? Are you kidding? The entire town knows who I am. That's why we wear masks. Delivery. Half a dozen roses. No vase. Ida... what's going on? What are you doing here? I can't go back. I don't know what you're talking about, but you need to leave right now. I have to tell you something. I don't have time for this Ida, alright? Whatever you think is important, it's not. Trust me. I have to get out of here. Open up Reins. We have a warrant. Shit. Ida, what's going on? I've been trying to tell you. Oh my god! What is happening? I need you to look at me and tell me what's going on right now. Either open up or we'll open it for you. I didn't do anything. I didn't. I promise I didn't. You have until the count of three, Reins. Ida! One... one of the photos of me, - One, - I don't know how it happened. It got into the school and... - Two. - They say they know you took it. I said you didn't. I swear, but they won't listen. Get back. We're coming in! Hands up! You're under arrest. Distribution of pornographic material of a minor. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say or do will be used against you in a court of law. We know Valor was poisoned. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. You understand these rights? Sheriff Gains. Yes. When? I understand. I'll be there as soon as I can. Take him down to the station start processing him. I have to go. I'll be there when I can. Hey, don't you think you ought to be here for this? It's Hal. so is this how it works for you, Mr. Picture Man? All those photographs of the town, just a front, so you can manipulate and take advantage of little girls. Is that what you do? Is that how you get your thrills? Now that's all gonna change for you real soon. You know what they do to boys like you in prison, don't ya? Don't cha? You little chicken shit. You can't even look me in the eye, can ya? I need you to listen to me very carefully... What the hell was... change of plans. We have to move. Now. Vaults close in fifteen minutes. Get changed. Here.

Undetermined. Last confirmed contact was two hours ago from an unapproved line. Is there any reason to believe he's been compromised? I believe so. What were the terms? Deep cover. Any means necessary. Last known location? Goodland, Kansas. Cut ties. Sir? Burn him. Hurry the fuck up. Where's the money? Jesus Christ. There's more here than we thought. What the fuck is your problem? A gun was pulled in the bank. That's how it goes. You want to play cowboy you might get shot. Gains killed Kilmer. - I know. - How? The victor's gun speaks last. You know, when I was arrested Gaines... said Valor was poisoned. Don't. Hands up. Slow. It was you, wasn't it? You killed Valor. Turn around. Why? He became a loose end. Had to be tied up. Simple as that. A lose end? You can't bring heat before a job even starts. And I'm sure a larger cut had nothing to do with it. I got a call... from Valor's phone. Sure it had nothing to do with you though. You can take care of yourself, right? I have a new plan. You're taking me to El Charro. are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to get in this car, and we're gonna deliver this money to him personally. I couldn't get to El Charro even if I wanted to. But you know someone who could. What's your end goal here? How do I get to El Charro? I will kill you! You have no idea who I am...
