Earn Rs. 5 lakhs and my daughter Gita.. ..will be yours forever. I will be back. Think about it, Pritam. Those who live in huts.. ..shouldn't dream of living in palaces.

When will you give it? - Right now. Here. Not the pop-sickle. I mean my money. Vasooli, forget about your money. Why? - Your jet-ski business was ruined. That's why we bailed you out.. ..so that we can start a new business. Do I look like a.. Fool to you. - Vasooli, the truth is bitter This bitter? Come this way, everyone knows.. .. that you don't hold any respect amongst others! What? - Yes. And only because you are not a well known name. Nor do you enjoy the fame of an established business. With respect, you will also attract fame. And gorgeous girls will fall for you. That felt nice. But the jet-ski business.. was ruined. On that note, I just remember.. Diwali (Festival of lights) is approaching. Why don't we open up a fireworks shop? Vasooli fireworks. Vasooli 'Chakri' (Fireworks). Vasooli 'Sursuri' (Fireworks). Vasooli 'Lavangi' (Fireworks).

I am talking about you. What have I done? Aren't you ashamed.. ..of following me around.. at this age? I didn't follow you, Guddi. Well, coincidentally, 6-7 times in a day.. Coincidences don't occur 6-7 times in a day. All the neighbours have noticed you.. If you were so concerned about me.. ..you should've come back then! I had left for coming back. But I was exhausted trying to fill the bag.. ..your father gave me. I danced in the discos all night! Sold coconut water during the day! On weekends, I went about selling sweets from door to door. Children would shout at me "Here comes the sweet seller". When I returned, I saw that your house was locked. I asked everyone around. In turn, they asked me as to why did I not ask about it 3 years back. I waited for you, Guddi. But you.. you got married! Didn't you? Did you buy those 3 children from the Big bazaar sale? Buy one, get two free. Did your sons pop out from a toaster? They are not.. They are not my children. They are uncle Shambhu's children. What? You.. you married uncle Shambhu? What is he saying, Guddi? What are you.. No. Have you gone crazy? They are uncle Shambhu's grandsons. Yes. Oh, my God. - Their family passed away in an accident.. ..and Gopal and Laxman started living with us. Then.. My father suffered a big loss in his business. He couldn't endure the shock. He.. he died. I moved to Goa from Dehra doon with whatever little I had. I settled here with Gopal and Laxman. I didn't marry, Pappu. I just waited. But why am I telling you this? Guddi. My days would begin with 'Roshni' (Sunlight).. ..and end with 'Chandni' (Moonlight). Two girls at once! No, no. The sunlight and the moonlight, It's a phrase! Since I couldn't find you.. ..I devoted my life to orphans. I took up a job at the Jamnadas orphanage. And one fateful day, the owner of the orphanage, Jamnadas.. ..died while drinking milk. While drinking milk? Yes, the buffalo fell on him. The orphanage was orphaned. Jamnadas transferred everything in my name.. ..which was already under debt. I lost everything. All the children were adopted. All I was left with was the orphanage's bus.. ..and three helpless children. I didn't get married all my life, just like you. I just waited. Wow, that's great! Shinde, hold this. I knew it. I just knew it. 1942. A Love Story (Indian movie). It's true that love doesn't come with an expiry date. By the way, I am Daboo. Look, Daboo. - I saw everything. Listen, Daboo.. - I heard everything. Daboo, the children should never find out.. ..that we are not their real parents. For my sake. Look, dear, if they find out they're orphans.. ..they will be hurt. - Yes. Fine, Uncle. Okay, Aunty. That chapter will stay closed. Thanks. - But what about this chapter? What do you mean? Fate has brought you two back together? Why? So that now you can fulfil your unfulfilled dreams? - No. This isn't possible. Thanks. - This isn't possible. So sweet. They both still think alike. Guddi weds Pappu. Wow! Go for it, Daboo. "My heart." "I am still the same, so are you and so is this world." "But wonder where she is." "Everyone's here, but wonder why I am still alone." "Who should I call out to here?" "Your love.. is coming back to me." But what's the problem, Aunty? It's full of problems, Daboo. This isn't possible. Come on, Aunty, why isn't it possible? If wife is the heart, husband is the heartbeat. If wife is the lamp, husband is 'Diwali'. If Wife is the speech, husband is the abuse! - Quiet! Get married at this age? People will mock me! What will the children say? I don't mind, Pritam, get married. Gopal. What do you think about marriage? - Whose? Mother.. Wishes that you and me should get married. - Yes. Nonsense. How many excuses will you cook up, Pritam? That's enough. Next week if I don't get my money.. And if I don't get my rent.. ..you can forget about staying in this house. Its a warning! "Your love.. is coming back to me." Chillax, Pappu! Don't worry about this house.. ..you have Guddi's house! It's quite spacious! Daboo, what will the world say.. What about the world? Come on, Aunty, you love him, you want to marry him. And you're concerned about the world? Oh, my God! I don't believe this. Aunty, you're getting married! You're actually thinking of getting married! At this age? What will the world say? Daboo, talk to aunty! Facebook, did you hear this? Aunty is going to get married! I don't believe this! That's enough, Daboo. I don't know how much longer I am going to live. And you.. - Uncle. I read somewhere. "Add life to days, not days to life." "Life." "Life for me is living each moment for you." "Without you.. nothing is right." But.. it's not that easy, Daboo. You know that our children don't get along. I see, so that's your problem. Then there's no problem. What "No problem", Daboo? What will the children say? Don't worry. None of your five children will say anything. By the way, we need to handle only two. One is crazy, the other can't speak. And by the time the third one finishes speaking.. ..you two will be married. Daboo. Daboo, don't be crazy.. Guddi, I think Daboo will rest only after getting us married. Shut up, Pappu. What are you saying, Daboo? Mother's.. mother's.. - Yes, mother's marriage, Laxman. Gopal, mother's happiness lies in it. Oh, no, this is suicide! Isn't it, Brother? Don't be hard like the coconut skin. Think like the soft inside. It's their incomplete love story.. ..and it's happy ending depends on your permission. But how can we say yes? For our mother's.. mother's.. - Your mother's.. Happiness, Laxman. Think about the one she loves. Think about his three children. They too shall get a mother's love. And who can know better than you two.. ..about what mother's love is all about? That's fine, Daboo, but.. - But what? This is an opportunity.. ..to do something for mother. Fine, suppose we agree. But what about the world? What will the world say, Brother? People will laugh at us. They'll say, "Look, they're going to their mother's.. mother's". People talk! That's their job. You're concerned about the world? Your mother went through so many troubles to raise you two. Was the world concerned about your mother then? She raised you two. Made sacrifices.. ..did the world think about your mother then? What is important? Your mother's dreams.. ..or the world's opinions? What is important? Your mother's love or the world's hatred? Enough, Daboo. Those three little children will receive mother's love. Little? Well, yes, one of them.. ..cannot even speak yet! But, Brother, the world.. - Forget the world. This wedding will happen! Okay. Okay. Mother's.. mother's.. Will happen.. will happen.. will happen. Yes, she's the one whom he used to follow. I've caught him red-handed. Pa. At this age? you should be ashamed! Even the lord is just a few days older to you! You're growing old.. ..and such cheap behavior. I mean. There are just two reasons due to which a person falls on his face in life. Either his shoe-lace is untied. Or he's characterless. For the first time, don't shut up. Continue. You're absolutely right. That is why I am warning you guys. My aunty will lodge a complaint against you. She has high contacts. Anything is possible. You all will be in a fix. Isn't there a way out? - There's just one way. Getting Uncle and aunty married! Getting Uncle and aunty married? That sounds so strange. Dude, marriages only happen amongst relatives! Mom marries dad. Sister marries brother-in-law. Brother marries sister-in-law. Similarly, uncle marries aunty. And yes, let me tell you one thing. Your to-be mother has two children. Children? - Little ones. Little? - Quiet! I am not done yet! Madhav. - Yes. And anyway, they loved each other in the past. Really? - Laxman, it's a noble deed to bring two lovers together And, Lucky, you always wanted a mother, didn't you? Those who have a mother have.. kiss. Emraan Hashmi (Indian actor). - Fool. He means heaven. Madhav, so what do you say? Think about it. Tell me. Fine. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Hey, we want to meet our soon to-be mother and her children. Meet them? - Yes. You can. Meet them at the wedding. - No, no. We want to meet them before the wedding. You want to meet them. - Yes. You want to meet them. - Yes. You rascals. Take it. Don't feel shy. Want anything, Son? Mother, he's calling you "mother". He wants a mother. Mother, your blessings. Mother, your blessings. Where are your children? They didn't listen to me. They wanted to buy gifts for their brothers. They left. They'll be late. Here, have some biscuits! How much will you stuff us, Daboo? Can I ask you something? Yes, Son. Go ahead. Do you consume liquor? No, if this is an inquiry. But yes if it's an offer! I told you, not to point your finger at him. Where are your.. - Drop it. Where are your children? They just called. They're in the school bus. But they'll be late as they are stuck in a traffic jam. You can meet them at the wedding. One big happy family. You seem to be the groom and you seem like the bride Who are the witnesses? These two. Somehow, you look like the groom! I feel the same. Okay. So you are representing the groom? - Yes. And you are representing the bride? - Yes. And you? - What difference does it make? Take the signatures.. ..and complete the formalities quickly. Dear, calm down, calm down, calm down. Marriage is a once in a life time thing. It's the unification of two souls. Hey, boring old soul, just do your job. Yes, yes, yes. Sign here. Sign it, sign it. Come on, quickly. But the children aren't here yet. - They will be. According to the priest, 11:32 is an auspicious time. Sign it. Brother. Let's send father to Bangkok for his honeymoon. What is he doing here, Laxman? What is he doing here, Laxman? Dude, whose wedding are you off to? Your father's. - Will it do? Madhav, how does he know? Relax, He's mocking us. - Yes. Come on. Uncle, are you going to take up the entire day? Hurry! Congratulations. It's done. They're married. That is all. He drives the bus. - Yes, myself. Here, have sweets. Hey oldie, pass me the water. Pappu, My left eye seems to be twitching for some reason. That's because soon trouble is going to pop its ugly head! Mother. Look, they are coming now. Pa. They're married. Why didn't you wait? Greetings. Greetings. What are you looking for? Where are your children? "My father's wedding." "My father's wedding." "People are fooled once in a while." "In a blink you are.." What are you staring at? Meet your brothers? The two of us and the five of you. Give each other a hug! You are now brothers. Brothers. No, no. - No. This can't be. - No. It's a lie. - This can't be. - It's a lie. He is not my brother. - Did you just call me insane? You stammer prince! - You are a mouse! Our brother? Divorce him. You stupid! - You idiot! Gopal. Oh, no. I got hit. Take this cake. Save me. Save me! My brother won't spare you. - Hey, your brother is.. Mummy. Mummy. Leave it. Leave it! Oh, no. No, Gopu. - No, no, no. My fingers. Check the time. What are you doing? Hey, leave me! Gopu. Gopu. - What are you doing, pal? Gopal, he'll freeze. Leave it. Gopal. - Gopu. - Laxman. Police. - Were you guys here? Leave him. Bye good night. Take these guys away. Golmaal! Golmaal! Golmaal! Golmaal is back again! Golmaal! Golmaal! Golmaal! Golmaal is back again! Golmaal is back again! "Go. Go. Golmaal! is back again." "Go. Go. Golmaal! is back again." Hey, Daboo. Wait. Wait. Wait. - Catch her. Wait. - Daboo, wait. How much are you running? - She will be a thief one day. Daboo. Daboo. This isn't right, Daboo. I couldn't do better than this. Pal, I've just made two lovers meet each other. But you lied. What lie? - What lie? You said the children were little! But they are huge.. Hooligans. - Hey! You're a big liar. I didn't lie. I only concealed the truth. Can't you make a small sacrifice for your parents? I thought all you brothers will live together in harmony. Harmony. They're bad luck. - Yes. We won't live together, not at all. We weren't bitten by a mad.. Dog? - No, Lucky. Who did you call dog? - Him. - You are mad. Hey. - Hey come here. She has left! Pritam's cheaters are here. Pritam's cheaters are here. You are here? Give us some time. No, no. - What no! We have been staying here since so long. Why are you laughing? He means to say there's no need. Your father has surrendered the keys to this house. Now you all are homeless just like us. Rascal. Get lost. - What are you doing, pal? Pa, the luggage? I am a coolie. I am going to load the luggage in the train.. ..which shortly arrives on platform No. 2. We have to go to mother's house. I've gathered your luggage. Let's go. Pa. I will not pick this luggage up and lose my self-respect. My self-respect is equal to that of the president of India. How? She never visits my house.. ..and I don't visit hers. Wow. Wow. Very proud of you, very proud of you. Thank you, Pa. The president won't visit our house anytime soon. - No. But HE would surely be on his way to recover his money? Who? - Raghu. Raghu. I don't want to stay here, I am coming along. What? What are you doing, Lucky? You're going? Lucky.. - You go on, but we are not coming along. - No, Madhav. Let him go. Madhav, I.. - I am there for you! Laxman, we will not go to their house. We could live on the streets if needed. We can't live with those who don't respect us, Laxman. My brother.. Why you.. Pa. Pa, we're here. - Why? Why? Because we get it.. ..when death is near, one often runs in the wrong direction. Shut up. Pa, let's go. Mother must be waiting, Pa. We'll go to mummy's place. Uncle, come in. Come in. Gopal, Laxman. Pa is here. Aunty. - What happened? - Look who is here. Laxman. Uncle, where is your luggage? - Here it is. Hi. You. You're here to drop Pa off isn't it? He isn't a semester to drop out of! We're here to live with Pa.. and our mom. Mom. Mom. Bless you. - Our mother. Your Warsi is here. Sorry, I mean 'Waaris' (Heir). Mom. We have seen a mother before, but only in Nirupa Roy (Indian actor). We have heard the word "mother", but only in songs. We have used the word mother. But only in abuses. Hey, what are you saying? We've found a home, Mother. - Home? No, no, he means to say.. ..that the home is now complete. All under one roof. - Yes. And if you go to see.. even beggars.. ..keep all their coins in a single bowl. Beggars? - Beggars. Shut up, Laxman. - He means to say.. ..children are bound to stay with their parents. - Yes. Gopal. Son, listen to me. Oh, Mummy, save me. Pappa save me. Mother. Excuse me. Mother, where will these three.. - Stay? - Where? Aunty, they will stay in Gopal and Laxman's room, isn't it? And brother and I? - In the storeroom. Isn't it? Gopal and Laxman will live in the store room.. - Did you hear that? Gopal and Laxman will live in the store room. Mother has made her decision. Let's go, let's go. Just a minute. He will smash you now. - Hey. You said.. you can never live with us. So what happened now? It's our wish, we changed our mind. Good that you changed it. The one you had before was of no use. Look who is talking. He's talking about the mind. Finger. Finger. Brother, Finger. - Leave it. Run. - Run. Brother, we'll have to do.. something about them. "In this heart you reside." "My partner of many births, we are together." "My partner of many births, we are together." "In my eyes there's light." "We are together." I am don! Parag, another important detail. The person at whose house I hid the queen's necklace.. ..had a funky look and his face looked a little insane. Puppy boss, you're mind-blowing. I am not a bomb to blow your mind! Sorry, boss. But if my mother was alive.. ..she would've died out of joy. Because the person you are getting sketched.. SKTDS. Sketch. Has the queen's necklace in his house. So we will find him. That man and the necklace, isn't it, Parag? Sir.. Another important thing that I forgot to mention. Please welcome the guests with Pan Parag. He isn't Pan Parag.. ..he's sketch artist Parag. Have you finished the sketch? I've finished the sketch, but.. - Let me see. I salute you, Parag Hussain. What a sketch! It's him. That's him. That's the one. By God. You aren't human. You aren't human, you're an angel. You're caf Barista. Mr. Puppy. Let us see. - I won't show it. PUC , please. - I won't show it. Puppy boss, show. You scoundrels.. He's Aamir Khan (Indian actor) As in Ghajini (Indian movie). I never said he's Salman Khan (Indian actor) ..as in Chak de (Indian movie). Boss, Shah Rukh (Indian actor) starred in Chak De.. ..but why did you get this sketch made? I was watching Ghajini on a DVD yesterday. That image got sealed in my mind. It was a wonderful movie. "I went adrift.." What else does he expect? He keeps forgetting after every short-interval. Does that happen for real? Have you seen anyone losing his memory so frequently? Forgot it. Forgot it. 10 men try to hold on to one man. This. This way. He exhibits his sculpted body. Six packs and two partitions on the head. And there's something written here, here, here. There's something written all over. Is he a man or a notice board? And he carries a camera. Click here, click there, click, click, click. Are they trying to fool me? The other day, I said in a fit of rage.. ..that you've grown old. Actually you're still the same for me. If you dye your hair, Pappu. Then you've looks to die for. And.. Your personality is still the same. For so many years, you've been.. You hid your feelings in this photograph? Just a minute. - What? Pappu, you, too. Whenever I look at your photograph.. ..time stands still. For me, time is still standing where it was. Maybe time never moved on for us. You should've changed the batteries, Uncle. Daboo you are here? - Where else? I am going to have a sleep here tonight. But, Daboo, here.. - It'll be fun.. ..when the three of us chill together. Daboo, Guddi, Pappu. Don't trouble him anymore. Go, go out. Go out. - Of course. I am just an obstacle now. Now you're only going to listen to him. Your beloved husband. Mr. Pritam alias Pappu. - Enough. Go. Yes, yes, I am leaving. Aunty, Uncle, it feels really nice to see you two together. You're a stunning couple. Daboo. Thank you. - For what? You won't understand. Pappu, if I hadn't understood.. ..this would've never happened. She's a lovely child. Fate is so strange. She's an orphan. How can anyone be an orphan as long as you're there? Doesn't she and Gopal.. look like a stunning pair? Is there anything between them? I don't know. Sometimes I feel. But sometimes I feel.. Guddi. I wish that our children unite, just like we did. Laxman, it's really good.. ..these three fools came into this house. The fun will begin when the clock strikes.. - 12:00. When the clock strikes, they'll be dumbstruck. They don't know that it's a full moon night. As always, that ghost will come tonight. Yes. And as soon as their door.. And when they.. They'll be.. scared to death. And they don't have Bhairon Baba's amulet. Where did you get the amulet? - It's a teabag. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Madhav, ghost. There's no such thing as ghost, don't be insane. These rascals are going to scare us as ghosts. It's them. You mean a traitor within. Fashion designer bathes nude. Jayasurya (Sri Lankan Cricketer) goes to Sri Lanka. Shut up, Laxman. Let them come. Ghost, why you.. - What are you saying, Madhav? Why? - Now she's our mother as well. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello, Pa. Two minutes, Mother - Ya sure. Pa. You've completed our family. That's why we've.. brought a special gift for you. On a special.. - Day. For a special.. - Pa. A special.. - Gift. There's was no need.. - Wear it, wear it. Go, go, go. You're looking nice, Pa. Absolutely out of this world. You're looking.. - Rafiq. Terrific. No, I mean.. doesn't it look a little odd? Is it odd? - Yes. You think we're lying. Laxman is lying. Then go and ask your Laxman. Go. - I'm going. I'm going. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Take position. Okay. Okay. It's Pa. It's Pa. It's Pa. What is he saying? We aren't scared of him, get it? Hit him. Come on, come on. It's no ghost. He's stunned. He's stunned. He couldn't even say my name. Gopu. Who is under the blanket, Gopu? Pa is under the blanket.. - Pa! Sorry. - Is this.. is this the way you treat your father? - Sorry, dad. We thought it's a ghost. Ghost ? at this age. Pa, didn't you teach them? Pa, we just.. - I drive the bus. And you thought I was a ghost. - No.. You beat me up so severely. Washer men don't beat their clothes this way. - Sorry. Are they my children or the punishment for my sins? Pa. - Carefully. They beat me up so severely. Let's go, pa. - Pa. How will I go to the bathroom now? Pa, why are you walking like this? Now I won't be able to sit on the chair. Sorry, Pa. We couldn't even recognize our own Pa's behind? Yes. Got attracted to the glittering behind.. .. and started beating it up - Yes. Not everything that glitters is gold. Every footballer is not Maradona. And every soap is not Rexona. Shut up, Laxman. Now it's our turn. Just watch. An eye for an eye. And a bum for a bum "Bum chiki chiki Bum. Gopal's bum." Golmaal. "Bum chiki chiki Bum." "Bum chiki chiki Bum. Madhav's bum chiki chiki bum." "Bum chiki chiki Bum." My clothes are still wet. Anyway, my children are useless. But their shorts will come in handy. Facebook. Shut up, Facebook. I don't know, Lucky. He's been barking since I brought him out for a stroll. He's getting irritated because he's tied up. Let him loose. Let him loose. Let him loose. Yes, let him loose. Yes.. loose. Yes.. loose. Daboo, let him loose. Golmaal. Golmaal! Golmaal. Golmaal! Golmaal. Golmaal! Golmaal. Golmaal! Golmaal. Golmaal. Golmaal! Catch him. Leave him. - Leave him. Leave him. Leave him. Leave him. Facebook. Leave him. Leave me. Uncle. - What a dog! Hey, idiots! Pa. - Pa. - There is nothing left behind now. Knife. Matches. And Pa? Vasooli will take care of Pa. Let's go. We were waiting for this day so eagerly. - Yes. Let's go quickly and cut it. Cut it? - Knife? - Matches? What do they want to do to Pa? Pa. - What? That's why they called Vasooli. Shall we call Puppy? Have you gone crazy? We can't trust him. That absent-minded professor will kill Pa instead. - Yes. And anyway, Pa is going through a bad phase. Laxman, Lucky. We will have to save Pa's life now. Yes. - Yes. Exactly like we've to take off our pants ourselves in order to pee. Shut up, Laxman. But why have you called me here? Uncle, once Gopal and Laxman are here.. ..there's going to be a blast. Here they are. We will have to save him. Come on. - Yes. Yes. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to Daboo. Happy birthday to you. Come on, cut the cake. Raise your hands up in the air, like the ragamuffin don't you care.. Dabbo dabbo dabbo that's my girl, happy returns of the day.

May you live for a 1000 years.. golmaal golmaal May god bless you.. golmaal golmaal.. golmaal golmaal Are you done? Do you want a grand salute now? What a surprise? You all remembered? - Of course. Do you know who organized all this? Gopal. How nice, Gopu! Sir.. - Come on, cut the cake. - Yes, please.. Where is Facebook? Daboo, don't call Facebook. He has ruined the features of my back. Come on, cut the cake. Come on. Blow the candles. - Come on. Yeah. It is good, right? Can I? Tell me the truth. Were you here to celebrate or to start a fight? Talk to him. You really are like God's justice. You're soundless. What a shot! Brother. Brother, that fatso.. hit me. Hi, guys. I've an announcement to make. Today, on my birthday, there's a movie treat for everyone. Yes, yes. Hurry up. What are you all waiting for? Come on. What do you mean by everyone? Mother, Pa. Everyone. I won't go with them. - Me.. Say it quickly or else the movie will get over. Won't go. We will go. It's Daboo's birthday. There can't be anything more important than that. - Yes. Gopal, if you could come.. - I said no. In case you change your mind.. Mind. Only if he had a mind. Ok. - Let's go. Never mind, never mind, never mind. Mind. You go along with them. And listen.. look after Daboo. Tell me. What gift do you want? Ah, there you are. - Popcorn for everyone. And cheese popcorn for the birthday girl. Scoundrel. The scoundrel's here. His name should've been Facebook and not Laxman. Come on, hurry up. Or we'll miss the movie. - Yes. Just a minute, sir, I am preparing the bill. Why? Are you a mouse? Are you a mouse that you're preparing a 'Bill' (Burrow)? You're going to pay everyone, but not me. Rascals, you're entertaining yourself here.. ..after swindling my money. You're here to watch a movie. Get lost. - Why do you speak? Don't say anything.. - What was he blabbering? What was he saying? You coward. What's going on here? What's this? Talk to me. Fine. Let's talk. Come on. Look, what they are doing. Don't tell me. Hey, hey, hey. Laxman. Mom. Aunt! - It is okay. Don't go. Daboo. No. No. Gopal. Gopal. I'm fine. Please stop him. It's okay, Gopal, it's just.. It's okay. Gopu, let me.. - I am doing it. Let me.. - How many more people do you owe money? Gopal. - How much more will my mother suffer because of you? Gopal, don't blame Pa. We owe them money. - I see. You came here because you couldn't return the money. Oh, my God. What are you saying, Gopal? Brother is absolutely right, Mother. What is he right about? You aren't honest either. Hey.. - Hey, don't think we don't know about your business. Not just you, entire Goa knows about it. But our mother never faced a problem because of that. Your entire family is a problem. Gopal, that's enough. Shut up or else.. - Or else.. Stop it. You're brothers. We don't have any father or brothers. Enough, Gopal, you're going too far. You shut up, Daboo. You were very eager to get them married, isn't it? Now watch. - See the consequences of your decision! You wanted to get married. You made a mistake, Mother. You made a mistake! Guddi. It happens in a fit of rage. After all, they're children. They aren't juvenile children. "Mother took a wrong decision. Pa took a wrong decision." If you two hadn't decided to raise them.. ..they would've been rotting on the streets. You did so much for them though you aren't their parents. So many sacrifices. If I go and tell them that they're orphans.. ..they'll be stunned. Daboo. Didn't I tell you that they shouldn't find out? They shouldn't find out. Daboo. They're our children and they always will be. Don't tell them anything. Lucky. Gopal. Get lost from here. Didn't you hear what he said? Let's end this chapter once and for all. Move. Hey, get some sense in your brother. "She isn't their, mother." What are you saying? Is this a joke? Lucky, what is this.. Lucky. Pa isn't our Pa. Quiet. Stop it. You've gone crazy? You're talking nonsense. What, Madhav? - Are you out of your mind? Madhav? - Yes. What is he saying? He's speaking the truth. Aunty and uncle made me promise them. But this fool heard everything. You're simply great. You didn't utter anything all your life. And today when you did, you stunned everyone. You hid it from me as well, Daboo. What would you've done if I had told you? Why didn't Pa tell us? How can he do this? I am going to talk to him. - Stop, Madhav. What will you ask him? "Why did you raise us if we were orphans?" When he doesn't want you to find out and be hurt.. ..then you shouldn't hurt them by telling them. They will die. No one will say anything. Lucky, you didn't hear anything. We don't know anything. And you, too. Gopal, if you don't say it.. If you say anything.. If you say anything.. I will break your finger. Guys, I am an orphan as well. Take me in your gang too. Don't we look like the Indian Cricket team? Why? Are they orphans as well? "Life.. has gained speed." "The passing lanes.. just said to us." "This moment.. belongs to us." "Once it's lost, it can't be gained again." "Understand the gestures of the passing winds." "Live each day like it's your last." "Live each moment like it's your last."
