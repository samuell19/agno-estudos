What? Tommy, Mom and I... have something to tell you. Something important. Now's good? I don't know... There'll never be a perfect time. - Wanna do it? - No, go ahead. Right, so... How do I say this? First of all, Mom and I love you, ok? You know that, but it's always good to hear. I'm going to tell you a story. Mom and I once shared an apartment with a couple of friends. Marthe and Aurélien. We played music together. One day, Marthe and Aurélien had a baby. But it wasn't a good time. They were broke, they were young. Right? Like us. They were a bit too young. And, after a while, Marthe left. Overnight, Aurélien was all alone with the baby. He was lost. That's normal. Then one day, Mom and I wake up... and we hear crying. We go to the living room and we find the baby crying in the living room in its... - Car seat. - Car seat. No sign of Aurélien anywhere. He'd vanished. So we wait and wait and wait. He never came back. We never heard from him again. And well... that little baby... is you. Now you know. We wanted to tell you later, when you were old enough. But we saw Aurélien. Not in real life, though. We saw him on TV. He's Orelsan, the rapper. Aurélien is Orelsan. It's wild. Unbelievable. I mean, it's totally wild. Can you imagine? We thought you needed to know, so you could choose. We'd understand. He has money... He has a dog... maybe. He may even have ponies. But we're... You get what you see. If you want, we can contact him. I'm sure he'd be willing to take you back. But it's your choice. Funny. LOL. Hilarious. Maybe, but this time it's true, Tommy. Aw, dammit! You used to believe everything! Where's the fun if I can't torture you? It's just that Orelsan is way too big. I know! When I said it, I knew it. But once you get started, there's no turning back. - Your sense of humor is freaky. - I'm kidding. Don't tell the shrink. On the contrary, tell her! Go ahead, tell her. What about the house? No, don't tell her that. Listen. - To hear what? - Exactly. Noise reduction earmuffs: What word don't you understand? - Give 'em back. - No. Where you going? I'm done. No. Stay, it's a family breakfast. So? The weather's nice, there's home-made jam, we're a family. We love each other. Awesome, right? You didn't feel the mood? Like a cereal commercial. Know what I mean? - Let's do it again. - What? Take two. Go and come back without earmuffs but with a smile. - Where from? - You choose. With a smile! She's coming. Good Biscotte. Right, Biscotte? Good doggy. Go fetch! Go fetch! Today doesn't matter. It's tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. Not today. Dad? We won't be late this year, right? Late where? No, don't worry. Tomorrow morning, 0800 hours. It's up here. Can we check the list? - Again? - Pretty please. Let's do it. Fountain pen, 1. Blue ink cartridges, 10. Erasers, 3. 3? No... How many? 2! 2! 2. I'm making the pizza at the same time. Ruler? OMG, you like grew so much during vacation! No, it's the skates. Right, the skates! I hadn't noticed. Sweet! It's the thing in New York. So, you're actually not weird at all. We said that because we were like so jealous. Same for all the other stuff. And when Van... Why can't I go in the attic? You're wearing makeup. Yes. Why can't I go in the attic? There's a lock. Why's there a lock? So you can't go in the attic. I heard a noise up there. It's house noises. We've been over this 100 times. Old houses make noise. It's nothing. Then why can't I go in the attic? Don't start. That's the way it is. Get used to it. Not fair. No, it's not fair. Hello, ma'am. How are you? Yes. When? Tim! They're on their way! Shit, Tim, they're on their way! Shit! They're coming home a day early in the end! Holy shit... Tommy, haul butt. What the hell are you doing? Gimme a break, Mom. The pizza buffet. Thank you, but the timing's bad. Next time, ok? I'll do this. Do the bathroom, it's dirty. - It was already dirty. - But now it's our dirt. Too clean is sketchy. No, cleanliness goes unnoticed! What is this? Do we have to discuss this again? Move your ass. Tommy, c'mere. Since we're in a rush, you're in charge, ok? Remember how it works? Go everywhere, match the pics. If they don't match, fix it. Ok? - Everywhere, everywhere? - Yes. - Even the attic? - 'Course not. What's in the attic? I don't know, it's locked. You said you'd unlocked it and what you saw was "out of this world." Just to screw with you. Come on. Do I have a choice? Actually, you do, Tommy. Always, you know that. Every minute, you have a choice. But beware, it's life-changing. One thing leads to one life, another to a different life... So choose fast 'cause they're coming and if they find us... they'll call the cops. Approved? Approved. Signature detail. Let's move. Got a smoke? You have them. - No. - You do. - I don't have the smokes. - You do. You know, I can find the same kind of monkey. Forget the monkey. I'm not a baby. Tim! Problem is, your dad's a deadbeat. Take your bag! You'll never believe... Quiet! They're here. I'm trying! I'll fix some leftovers. And there's always mackerel in the freezer. Anything else from the back? Ok, let's go. Get down. You ok? That's memory worthy. One hell of a memory! I need the song. I have to find the perfect track. The pressure's on. Ready? Thank you. Is that tasty? Want some? - You sure? - No, thanks. You don't mind eating that crap? Considering what I was cooking. You know, if you start eating according to what you could have eaten, it's gonna get complicated. Same as with guys. Same as with guys. You have to make do. That's your philosophy of life? What you'll bequest to your daughter? - Make do? - Yeah. She can't hear anyway. No harm done. What? Change of plan. I have something to settle. Drop me off. What's going on? Drive. Turn, it's here. Here? Stop here. I spotted it. But the two guys and the truck... What truck? You dick. Not funny. You can touch the bottom! What's the risk? It's fine! Obviously when you know how. Come on, Mom! Your thing is weird. 5-year-olds know how to swim! I know how to swim! I can do the butterfly. - Then do it. - Gimme a sec, will ya? It's fishy! - Fishy? - Well, yeah. You dick. - Where you going? - You piss me off! Watch! You ready? I did it! - Mom, did you see? - Did you see? Did you watch? What? You didn't see? Again. - Bye, Mom! - See ya, sweetie. What's with her? Wee-wee. Do you have to go work? Yeah. I said I'd come this afternoon. Think I'm thrilled about redoing the same drive to reclean the same house? Then quit. Great idea. Then what? We improvise. That's your proposal? No. But how about an indecent proposal? Ok, get lost. I have to work. Speaking of... What're your plans today? I dunno. Seeing Marco? - Maybe. Why? - Because... Never mind. See ya. No, tell me. I've mentioned Albin, right? I think so. I bumped into him 2 days ago. And? And we had a drink together. And I didn't mention it because you imagine stuff. So why tell me now? Because he hit on me. I blew him off, of course. Of course. Anyway, we argued and... And then he threatened me. Threatened you how? A kind of blackmail. About what? Nothing, just... Old stories, unimportant stuff. Spit it out! He said he was putting stuff online. What stuff? Movies. Well... I never told you, but I was in few movies a while back. You know me, I could never say no. And it was for the money, too. What movies? A bit of everything. Nothing bad. Amateur stuff with his friends. And one or two more professional gigs. We met a guy in the industry. Porn? Yeah. What else? Anyway, he did it. He posted it. Sure, he's an asshole... but I wanted you to know because it's already circulating. Laetitia told me Marco saw it... And I think everyone knows by now. So if you see Marco, don't be surprised. Fuck. Holy fuck. Holy fuck! You're kidding? - What? No, I'm... - You're kidding. - I'm not kidding. - Holy fuck. I thought I was gonna croak. You're a frickin' nutcase. Come on, relax. Relax? Relax how? Don't do that. - Relax! - Don't, I mean it. "Where's the fun if I can't torture you?" "You used to believe everything!" That is not comparable. That's dangerous. I could've had a heart attack. My poor love. C'mon, it was a joke. Calm down. Wait. If I see Marco, I don't need to worry? He won't have news for me? I don't know. I gotta run. Scram. Not bad. - Not bad! - You know it. Ok, solfège. No, c'mon! Solfège. But Dad! Or a movie, then solfège. - Then solfège. - Sure? But I get to choose the movie. And I happen to have a few nuggets... stowed away for big occasions like... the last day of vacation. What's that? Trust me. Those pizzas were gross, right? Mega gross. 'Course they were. Answering machine. - So normal people are the monsters? - What? In the movie. The idea is: Beware of normality. Normal people have something to hide. The only way of resisting them... is offing them. You'll get it as you grow up. I've already grown. Wanna check? Yeah? Alright. In position. Don't move. There. I grew 2 inches! I'd say 1, but that's already a lot. They won't believe their eyes. - Who? - The girls at school. There, I was 7. And there, 5. And there, 4? That's the first one. Your uncle did it. And before that? Before what? Why aren't there any before 4? 'Cause I wasn't around. Where were you? You know where I was. We've talked about it with Mom. - Don't you remember? - I do. Dad? - You're not going back to jail? - No. Don't you worry. They won't find me. Know why? They aren't looking. They've forgotten about me. They have other fish to fry. I only owe them 6 months. Why'd you go to jail? Can we save that for later? Let's just say it was the perfect time to make a different choice. I was working for a guy, the Alsatian. He asked me to do something, I said yes and I fucked up. I shoulda said no, but I said yes. I've changed a lot since. Thanks to you. Frickin' loud seagull. Get lost! Get me the earmuffs. - They're mine. - No. Technically, no. D'you buy them? Then they're Mom's. She bought them. This habit of always having the last word is exhausting. - Even when I'm right? - See? You're doing it again. - No, you just spoke. - No, you did. You. You're doing it again! - You are! - And now? - You. - Me. - Yeah. - There you go. Stop it. Get the earmuffs. No. Don't push it, Tommy. They're in Mom's car with my school bag. Solfège. Solfège. Chloé's voicemail. Beep. Message. I'm going to find Mommy. You go to sleep, ok? - You're leaving? - Not long. - I'm coming. - No, it's late. Tomorrow's the big day. Rest. We said we wouldn't be late, this year. 0800 hours, right? I'm not staying here alone. Tommy, please. I'm coming. Hi. Hey there, girlfriend. Hey, Marco. You ok? Why aren't you in bed? You're hungry! Tartlet? Help yourself in the fridge. - Does Daddy want one too? - I'm good. Did you hear that? Lithuanians. They're... What's wrong? Can you lend me your car? - Sure. When? - Now. - Now? - Yeah. - For how long? - 2 hours. 2 hours! Tim, it's complicated tonight. How do I get home? I can wait, but... it's just that... I have a date. Well, not a real date. A girl who works in a bar in Paimpol. I'd really like to make it before her shift's over. Without going into too much detail. You get the picture... - Forget it. - Don't take it badly. Tommy, let's go. Forget it. What's the problem? No problem. We all have our own shit. - Ask Steph! - I'll manage, ok? Whatever. Got something to tell me? Such as? About Chloé, for instance. Something you saw on the Internet. Or not. No. I don't understand what you mean. You're being weird. I'm telling you, weird. Fuck me... Coming or not? Where we going? Back to the house. - Stay here. - No, I'm coming! If Mom comes back, what'll we do? Wait here. It's your mission. Dad! Yeah? The attic. Check the attic. Is this gonna take long? I can see we're in an angle, but this is gonna be boring as hell. An angle? Yeah. When things can go one way or the other. An angle. This morning, when your dad asked you to check the house with the phone, had you said no, he'd have done it himself, lost loads of time. The people woulda found you, your mom woulda lost her job, at best, she never woulda come back here, we wouldn't be stranded in this car. An angle. A plus B. - Another example... - No, I got it. That day, if Dad hadn't said yes, if he hadn't seen the Alsatian, he wouldn't have done what he did, and he wouldn't have gone to jail. Great example. Things woulda been different. He woulda been there for your birth and the days after. He coulda tattooed your first years on his arm. No, not that. Normal people don't get tattoos. That's true. Everything woulda been normal. Super normal like... chocolate croissant after school, treasure hunt in the yard. - We'd have a house with a yard? - Inevitably. Maybe even this one. - We'd be the people in the house? - Yeah. Which means some other family woulda squatted your home during vacation. Some other girl woulda slept in your bed. - I hate her. - No you don't. You never woulda known. You missed her by a whisker. Meaning you woulda done something like... empty your bags, zen-like, eat the frozen mackerel and maybe play a board game in the afternoon. Monopoly? Sure, Monopoly. After that, normal day. Light dinner. Evening prayer, brush your teeth and beddy-bye. Except that evening... someone woulda rang at the door. And then what? You can't know. That's how angles work. If you don't choose, you don't know what happens afterward. Right now, you have two choices. Sit tight and play by the book. Or go check things out over there. Play by the book. Don't play by the book. The only real fucking choice. Let me check, then I'll leave! I'll go, just let me check! I asked you politely! You hear me? Open up! Open up! Open this door! I used my manners, didn't I? I was polite! You're pissing the fuck out of me! Open the door! Her car's here. Open this fucking door. Call them. I don't give a shit! I don't give a shit! Is opening up so complicated? Is it? Is opening the door so complicated? No! Goddammit! Chloé? We told you she left! Give me the combination to the attic. My daughter is sleeping upstairs! I'll kick the door down. Sir, I called the police. You need to leave. Serge! The gun. Hurry! Leave! What are you doing with that? Put it away. I'm not leaving. Émilie, stay in your room! Careful! Don't! She saw me. Right now, you have two choices. Sit tight and play by the book. Or go check things out over there. He told me to wait here. Where's Mom? Coming. Let's go! That asshole already called the cops. Follow me! Who are you riding with? Mom? Mom. What? What happened? Something incredible. Shall I tell you? Yeah. I left you guys at the port and went straight back to houseclean. I rang at the door, but no one answered. So I... Oh shit. Where? Yeah, ok. The road to Lancry. Yeah, got it. What's the code? To the alarm. See you there. Want me to tell you a big secret? There. It's a baby. You left us at the port and went straight back to houseclean? What? You left us at the port and went straight back to houseclean. So I went straight back to houseclean. I rang at the door, but no one answered. I pulled out my keys, just as the owner opened the door. I have the keys because I'm... The housekeeping agency asked me to come today. Nathalie. - Serge. - Chloé. Hello, you're Chloé? I'll show you around quickly and let you... So I cleaned the house and at one point... Do you mind music? Not at all. On the contrary. I'll help you. It's ok, I'll manage. Really. Thank you. You played with the amp again? The volume was on full blast. - It's not me. - Who then? Didn't we say no more monkey? Having a cuddle toy at 11 seems weird to me. Now, if you're ok with weird... I'm done! I'm leaving. Bye. I'm heading out. Sir? Sir? Serge? - You didn't go in? - What? You didn't go in the attic? No. - Why? - It's just an attic. Want the rest of the story? Shit... You loser. You'll never believe me, Tim... What? No, wait. Guess what I did? What? Where are you now? Where are you? What did you do? - What did you do? - Everything's fine! At worst, his nose is broken. He wouldn't let me in the attic! You weren't answering. The car was parked here! Let's get outta here. Come on. I swear it's true, I swam. I took 'em for a spin. You ok? What now? We hit your brother's? I dunno, Tim. Why? There's Tommy's first day of school... We can't mess up like last year, it means so much to her. Are you serious? You keep saying they forgot you and can't make the connection. She doesn't have your name. - No one knows and at worst... - At worst? At worst? I'm not going back. You gotta be kidding. At worst? It's easy for you. We don't have a choice! Call your brother to tell him. Period. We cross the border, we'll be there by tonight. There are schools there too! At worst! Seriously. Damn earmuffs. Take those damn things off! What is with you? You really are nuts! Yes. If that was why I swear I'd tell you. Just don't tell the folks. No, please, it's just for a few days. Yes, I promise. I'm sorry. I'll buy you new ones. Better ones. With better silence. A much more silent silence. Ok? Please come back now! I'm counting to 10. One. Two. Three. What did you say to her? She took her school bag. We'll find her on the road. Gimme the keys. - Tim, the keys! - They're in the ignition. They're not. The keys! Did you chuck them? That was naughty! Where you going? To school? It's 7:25 and it's 40 miles away. Give it a shot, but I'd don't think you'll make it. Long story short, I was selling drugs. Know what that is? I met the Alsatian. He wanted me to work for him. I had to pick up cars in different countries, and bring them back fast. Cars a bit like this one. Race cars. Except not as flashy. One day, I had an accident. A lady was injured. Seriously injured. That's why I went to jail. Now you know. Did the lady die? No. You've never killed anyone? No. Why tell me now? Take a guess. I don't know. To let you know I can drive super fast if necessary. Hop in. You choose the perfect track. It's just for today. Understand? We'll pick you up and go straight to your uncle's in Belgium. Just one day, ok? Can't be late after all that. Time to brave the hyenas. It's your day to shine. Look, they're looking at you. You'll show them, easy-peasy. Now go! Not having the last word? No, that's your thing. Clearly not. You're the one who just spoke. This one's yours. Go for it. I won't resist, but let's do this out of view. It's my daughter's school. You'll arrest me, I promise. You will, but not in front of my daughter, ok? It's my daughter's school! My daughter's right there! Get off me! RENNES PENITENTIARY No, but the gull crashed into the fender. It splattered! There was blood everywhere. The guy with the mullet cut? Hey. Yeah, I see. Absolutely. Man, that is harsh. Totally. I'll call you back. Gimme 2 minutes. Bye. Ok, talk in a minute. You ok? I'm ok, yeah. We have to go shopping. I started a cake but we need eggs. What? Is there a problem? No. Yeah there is. Look at your face. No. Should we do it again? Say what? Yeah, we didn't capture the mood. Take two. Like a commercial. Turn around and come back out. And take a big breath of fresh air when you step out. A breath of freedom. Where from? The door. The world won't give you anything for free, believe me. If you want to have a life, steal it!
