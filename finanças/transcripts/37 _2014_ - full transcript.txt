Have you ever been haunted by something you did and no matter what, it's always there? I have. In a few months I'll be 37 and I'll finally pay for what I did. I'm gonna get the band back on top and then I'm gone. What the fuck? Adam... I've been calling you for an hour, man! Be nice if you could make it to your own show without needing a personal fuckin' escort. Right, sorry. Nerves, mate? Yeah, that must be it. Come on, you wanna lock up? Guess who's getting back together after a five year hiatus? One of my personal favorite bands, wendigo! They're playing the Roxy believe it or not tonight before they kick off their world tour. You know I'll be there. Good luck getting in. Capacity? You gotta be fuckin' kidding me. Private party tonight so keep walking. We're on the freaking guest list, you gotta let us in. This bitch wouldn't know wendigo from Skrillex. ♪ The mirror's calling ♪ ♪ broken words they mock you ♪ ♪ you call out ♪ there's no answer ♪ You slayed that shit tonight. If the rest of the songs are this good I'm gonna sell this tour out. You know something else? Starting next week I'm gonna have wendigo on K-Roq-Roq on power rotation. You're shitting me! Nice! Get a shot of my guys real quick. You guys sound great, let me get one. One more, one more. Love the new work. I just need to use the bathroom. Sorry, you can't be in here. There's bathrooms outside. Yeah, it's just a really long line and it's kind of an emergency. Please, I'll just be a second. She's with me. Unless you want to check the list for my name. Alright, cool. That's it, guys. Everybody get out. It's over. Oh! Uh, thank you. Don't mention it. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just a little confused by the security. I mean, those bathrooms aren't that impressive. I think the security's for me. Oh. Are you some kind of third world despot or something? I'm in a rock band. Oh. Nice meeting you. Alright, I'm a despot. Have a drink with me. Are you sure you're not in a rock band? I am a bloody, murderous, treacherous despot. Hm... okay. One drink, but you're gonna have to execute somebody for me. Deal. Come on. Why are you smiling? 'Cause you're easy to talk to. That's 'cause I haven't said one true thing yet. Alright, so tell me something that's true. I'm Jemma. I'm Adam. I know who you are. If my sister knew I was talking to you she would die of jealousy. She loved you guys. And you? Something for you, Mr. Webb? I really shouldn't be drinking. An apple Martini for Jemma and I'll have the usual. There you are, I've been looki- oh, my god. I've been listening to wendigo ever since- don't say it. You're about to make me feel old. Adam, this is my sister, Christina. How did you get back here in that outfit? What's wrong with her outfit? She looks amazing. Well, of course she does, but this girl works at sen boutique, for godsakes. Marine biologist. Oh. What's up with your face? What do you mean? Your lips are pulled upwards, your teeth are showing. Elliot, this is Christina. Christina... Elliot Kotts, I know. Christina's a huge fan of the band. Maybe you can take her backstage and introduce her to the rest of the gang. Come on, babe. I'm gonna steal this one. Thanks. I apologize. Not good enough. No? Nope. Now if you were to give me your number I might let it slide. Yeah, I really don't think that's a good idea. No? I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. It's a pretty convincing argument for thrift store clothing. As good as new, right? Love the new work. Where's Jemma? Who? The girl I was with upstairs. You took her sister down here. Dude, they took off.

Yo, it's Dan O'Banion in Los Angeles spending some time with Adam Webb and the guys from wendigo. Hi, so what's up? Good to see you after two years, and I know I speak for a lot of fans, thousands and thousands of fans, when I say we are all so excited that you guys are finally working on your next album! Any idea when we can expect it to drop? Yes, sir. We have a release date of October 25th. Yeah, October 25th, that's Adam's birthday. He's gonna be 37. So you've got two things to celebrate. We never need any reasons to celebrate. So you got any specific plans for the birthday beyond the drop of the sixth album? Yup, but that's a secret. Haha, come on, tell us. What do you got? Oh, mysterious. Party? Am I invited? No. Alright, I'll crash. I'll use my press pass, how about that, guys? Alright, what's the date? October 25th. October 25th, people. Wendigo! James? Surprise. You scared the shit out of me. I was just on my way back from a gig and thought I'd drop by. I've been hearing a lot of buzz about you guys. Everyone keeps talking about wendigo, wendigo, wendigo. You better leave room for me on that album of yours for some creepy background vocals. You don't look so hot. I think I’m losing my mind. Adam, what is it? What's wrong, babe? Hm? Talk to me. Everything. Why is everything so wrong? Come on, you're just working too hard. Come here. Let's go to bed. Beautiful. I'll take it. Adam... That's right. Cinderella. Do the fluorescent lights in here burn your retinas? Mr. Webb... Welcome to sen. Is there anything in particular that you're looking for? Yup. Wanna grab a coffee? I'm working. When does she get a break? Uh... you can take a break now. Okay. I'll be right outside. Thanks. I'll be back for that, okay? Great. There you go. Holy shit! Keep the change, thanks a lot. Thanks. So are you gonna run out or are you gonna stay with me for a while? I'm not sure. Oh, please, look... Oh, god! That's hotter than I thought. Should have thought that one through. I'm gonna keep my eye on you this time. So what do you say? Sure. Yeah! Now that fate has brought us together again how about... That number. What are the odds? Just over caffeinated. Sorry, look, about the other day... I'm really sorry I- it's fine. How's your job? Sucks. I'm actually thinking of quitting. Awesome. Based on all the details you know about my life? If you quit your job you'll have plenty of free time to go out with me. Selfish is kind of my thing. I do selfish like no one else. Selfishness if reasonably tempered with wisdom is not such an evil trait. Am I supposed to know what you're quoting? Fuck, no. We're in Los Angeles. When are you quitting? As soon as I get the courage. You just got it. I don't know if this is such a good idea. Hey! Wendigo! Where'd you go, wendigo? Where'd you go? Ahhhh. Would you like this wrapped as a gift, Mr. Webb? Yes, I would. Um, Jemma... Is there something that you'd like to say? Don't be shy. I don't think you should... I don't think you should buy the necklace. What? Jemma... I think she might be right. I love this piece. Jemma, I'd like a word with you. I bet you would. Jemma, let's roll. Time's up. Bye bye. ♪ have you ever walked around with me? ♪ ♪ Wrapped up in your misery? ♪ ♪ You're making me so confused ♪ ♪ blaming me for everything that I do ♪ Oh, good, you're home. And you're not wearing a turban. Uh, excuse me. I guess he knew we were coming. Yeah. Having second thoughts? No, no. Actually now that we're here I am a little freaked out. Let's go. We'll go somewhere for lunch. No. No, we're here now. Whatever. You know this psychic stuff is all crap, right? Maybe, but the future still scares me a little. Sorry about that. Who wants to go first? Actually we'd like to go together. Well, I really don't do my readings that way. Sure, I understand. Look, I’m not a psychic but I'm predicting that this can be done. Please, come in. Is that a joke, or...? Nope. If during the course of the reading I come across something disturbing or negative do you want me to divulge that? Yes. No. Please. Alright. Do either of you know someone who's passed on? No, neither one of us knows anyone who's died. Ever. We're actually from a clan of immortal human beings. There's a lot of happiness on the other side. Getting a lot of fatherly energy. Either of you have a father that is deceased? Yes. Yes. They just met! It was a good meeting. Yes, he, uh... I'm sorry, he's going now. Someone else is coming. Someone very, very shy. Come on. Gift... He says "a gift". You understand? A necklace? I'm sorry, there's some very dark energy around you now. Here we go. You want me to continue? Yes. Our guest is talking about an illness. A terrible illness. Why so shy? Oh, he's a child. He's a little boy. Okay, thanks. He won't let me see him. He's behind a door, he's hiding behind a door. He's talking to me from behind a door. Limited time. He's acknowledging that, yes. Your time is running out. That's it, that's enough. Thank you. That's very good. Thank you, let's go. Wow. Not too shabby. Not what I expected from you. Aren't you supposed to be some kind of a witch or wizard or something? No, that guy was a witch. I'm a madman. A lunatic. A warper of children's minds. Oh, yeah. And I’m told a few times a day that I totally fuckin' rock. Are you tee totaling or do you want a drink? After that reading I think I'll take a drink. Be right back. Make yourself at home. Ow! Are you alright? Yeah, yeah, I just fell. Oh, man. My poor knee, I got it pretty good. You're bleeding. What's a first date without a little blood, right? This is so embarrassing. It's alright. Stay right there. Be right back. Sorry. It's just gonna be a big bruise. Just hold the ice there, it'll keep the swelling down. If I lived here I would never leave this chair. Because of the view or because you'd be in traction? Because I love the ocean. I'm a marine biologist, remember? Oh, right. I guess the whole selling women's accessories kind of threw me off. When I was a kid I told everybody I was going to be a marine biologist. Really? You don't seem that enthusiastic about my childhood dream. Well, it's that fish are kind of, you know... They're kind of gross. I can't believe you just said that. Take that back. What's cool about a fish? They glow. Well, they've been holding out on me then. No, not the pedestrian fish. The ones down at the bottom of the ocean, way down deep where the sun can't penetrate, down in this whole other world of darkness, they glow. Like jewels. Like stars. Like you. Of course maybe you're just an angler fish. Sorry? The angler fish has this antenna that glows in the dark and when the other fish come near, lured by the light... Snap. He devours them. Yeah. Maybe an angler fish. You kind of have a weird mouth. Look at it. So beautiful. So eternal. The sunless sea. Sunless sea? "In Xanadu did Khubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree where Alph, the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea." It's a poem. "Khubla Khan" by Coleridge. B.a. In English. You didn't think I got all the way to sales girl without a degree, did you? Wait a second. English? I thought you said you were into marine biology. Was that a story or was that a truth? What did you want to be when you grew up? Me? A rockstar. Smart kid. If I could afford a mansion in Malibu I would be here in a second. Nothing to do then but date a super rich and talented rockstar and have him foot the bills for you. Yeah, true. But where am I gonna find one of those? I mean, one with talent. Ouch. You're a beautiful man, Adam. Why do I feel like I have to tell you that? You glow. You do. That was my gift to you. What's this? And why did it freak out that psychic guy? A Sygil. What's that? Comes from a magical system called Goetia. I use this symbol to summon a spirit. Why would anybody want to do that? Well, to make him do my bidding of course. What kind of spirit would it summon? A demon actually. Amduscius, the destroyer. When called he can be commanded to play music. His voice is so beautiful the very trees bend toward the sound of his singing. Did he write your music? Why do I get the feeling that I'm the first girl you've ever told this to who wasn't wearing black fingernail Polish? Just a symbol, Jemma. It focuses will and attention towards a goal. This is will... This is mercy... And this is severity. When you put it together like this it spells "god". But it looks like Adam. Not quite. First man. My great, great, great, great grandfather. How'd you get into all this stuff? I've been fascinated by this kind of stuff since I was a kid. Just trying to figure it all out, you know? I'm starting to see what drives your music. You see this little section here? This is the Sephiroth that represents blogging about hating your parents. Dare I even ask? Don't tell me. I'll figure it out by myself. You know, you're not the only person in the room with an awesome tattoo. You're inked? Tell me. It's a secret. Thirteen missed calls from Christina. I gotta go. No, Jemma... Stay. I haven't been outside to look at the ocean in years. Please stay. My sister's waiting. I've gotta go. Alright. I'm sneaking out. Yeah? Okay. Are you in trouble or something? Jemma! I'm not into the whole "pretty woman" thing, just so you know. No, no way. Can't pull it off. My legs. Your legs are beautiful. Oh, that would look absolutely fantastic on you. Thank you, but we're shopping for her. Well, you can't go wrong with the pants either. Would you like to try those on? Sure. Why not? Great. Alright, are you ready to lose all interest in me? Oh, come on. I can't wait to see those legs. I look like I’m walking around on two dropped bananas. Ouch. That was from the fall last week? Yeah. Jesus. Sooo... pants? Okay? Out! Oh, how did I- out. Of course. Did I mention how much I love bruised bananas? Out! Why, of course. Thank you. Anything else, Mr. Webb? Yeah, call me Adam. And another glass of wine each. I really shouldn't... Okay, what the hell. Yeah? Alright. That's what I'm talkin' about. I want to show you something. Just got it in this morning. It's the artwork for the new album. Sunless sea. That poem spoke to me I guess. Oh, my gosh. Here we are. Thank you. That poem gave me nightmares sophomore year. Last line especially. Last line? You do know it, don't you? When does the album come out? In 12 weeks. Adam, we need to go. Jemma? I don't know, she just suddenly got ill. What the hell are you doing? Okay, I don't follow you. Well, follow this. Okay? I don't know what kind of trip you're on but we have enough to deal with here. I want you to leave my sister alone. Okay, Christina, I don't know what you've read about me... Oh, I have a pretty good idea what your intentions are. And then you make her quit her job? What are you trying to do, take away whatever she has left? You think this is fun? Okay, Christina. I think we should start all over again. I know we're "little" people and I know our "little" lives don't matter for shit in your big world, but I want you to understand one thing. I don't care how famous you are, I don't care how rich you are, I'm not gonna let you fuck with my little sister. What is she supposed to do when you lose interest? She doesn't need her heart broken when she's already dying. Dying? She never told you. Jemma... No, she's not dying. It was the wine. She... she didn't drink much of it. She just felt a little sick. Jemma has a wonderful condition the doctors call ALS. You probably know it as Lou Gehrig's disease. No. No... How long? Adam... How long? We don't know. Not long. Please go. Come on! Where are you? James? You were just here! What do you want? Huh?! It can't wait any longer? Fine. I'll do it now. Just leave her alone. God! Come on, you goddamn gun! I need to talk to you. It's two in the morning. Please. Come in. It's very calming. Why don't you tell me what's going on, hm? Ghosts. You know, you might not believe this but I do take my work very seriously, Mr. Webb. I'm being very serious. I think I’m being followed. You make your money off of talking to dead people, right? Well, I read energy. I mean, if ghosts do exist then they possibly are energy. It's energy. I sense and I pick up on sensations and associations and maybe that is the dead. A lot of spiritualists believe that that is true. I'm not so sure. You're telling me that they're not dead? They're dead. When I pick up on someone's father I think I’m picking up on their projection of him, their vision, a construct that they carry, a part of them that has something to say, a voice. But I'll tell you this, it has great clarity. When I was a kid I did something terrible. Let's say that the dead can come back. Would they ever try to... I don't know, get revenge? Revenge? He's come back. He's punishing me. He's trying to take away everything I took away from him. The things that I love. I don't think the dead come back rattling chains or pushing people out windows or taking love away out of revenge. I think if there's anything left after life it's simpler than that. If somebody's punishing you perhaps you should look for the perpetrator in the mirror. So I'm crazy? No, I think you're scared. People have been scaring each other with the dead returning for a long time. But I think it's more terrifying to consider the alternative: The possibility that the dead may never return. Yeah, okay, thanks. Alright, bye. Jemma? Yeah. Jesus Christ, what the hell happened? I don't know, I fell. I hit my head. How long have you been laying here? I don't know. Couple of hours. Jesus. I'll get the first aid kit. No, Christina, wait... What the hell? There's... Jemma... These aren't even opened. Jemma, these aren't even opened. I know. You haven't been doing your injections? No. Why? I don't know. That's not a reason. Why? I don't know. Needles! The needles. You're scared of the needles? Yeah, I am. Jesus Christ. Why did you have to tell him? Oh, for god's sake, Jemma. I didn't do that to hurt you. You haven't been in this town very long. You don't know what this town is like. You don't know what guys like him are like. I'm just trying to protect you. I don't need your protection. Like hell you don't! Look at you! Look at you, you're falling apart. You need to fight this. You heard the doctor! You need this. It doesn't matter. Do not say that to me. Now give me your arm... Give me your arm. Give me your fucking arm... Just give me your fucking arm! I'm gonna die! Oh, my god... Oh, my god! I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. It's okay. There's no fighting this. Christina... You can't stop it. I can't stop it. Please, just let me be. Jemma... I don't want to lose you. But I’m losing... I'm losing everything. No... Jemma... Christina... I'm scared. I know, I know, baby. Okay, that's track #10. Adam? You missed a cue there, man. Turn the fucking mic off. Stop fuckin' hiding, man.

You didn't have to do that. Yes, I did. I'm good at shooting people up. When I was ten years old my, uh... My brother, James, was dying. He had bone cancer. A tumor started pressing on his lungs. He used to breathe, it was a horrible sound. I used to cover my ears at night. Sounded like there was a monster in the house. My dad was always a drinker. My mom, after James got sick she stopped trying to drag him home at night and started joining him at the bar. It fell to me to give him his pain meds. I hated going in there. Never knew what I'd find. He was my brother. I loved him more than anything in the whole wide world and now he was just this horrible thing wasting away in the back bedroom. The only time he was quiet was after I gave him his pain meds. One night he just, uh... He kept grabbing my hand. I didn't know what he wanted or if he knew what I was thinking. Or... I gave it to him. I gave him too much. I watched him take his last breath. His eyes like a sunless sea. I wanted to make him better but I killed him. Oh, Adam... When I found out how sick you were I got scared all over again. Scared what might happen to you. You're my angel, Jemma. Come with me. Where are we going? I want to see you every morning when I wake up. I want you to be with me and the ocean. I'm pretty high maintenance. This is crazy. Yes! Would you consider seeing another doctor? Get a second opinion? Adam, my insurance... Yeah, yeah, money. Come on. Would you go? I'm very glad Adam called me. A second opinion is very important in cases like this. Any issues with the medication you're taking so far? I actually only started taking them this week. Any improvements? I do feel better in fact. So what do you think about my prognosis? How long do I have? Hold on a bit here. ALS is a very tricky disease to diagnose and although symptoms are there I have to say it's very uncommon for ALS to come on so rapidly in someone your age. Especially female. So it might not be ALS at all? Could be a herniated disk, for example. Or a tumor pressed against the spinal cord. I mean, even Lyme disease is misdiagnosed as ALS. Let's just say that it is. About three years. It becomes fatal. But mine is aggressive. That's providing it's ALS. I'd like to schedule some blood and urine samples. Mri... An emg... I see that they haven't done a biopsy yet. No. Okay, let's get started there. I recommend when you leave this office, don't dwell on the maybes. Go out there and enjoy your life. We'll figure this out. "The shadow of the dome of pleasure floated midway on the waves where was heard the mingled measure from the fountains and the caves it was a miracle of rare device a sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice." Let's be dolphins in our next life. Okay. Dolphin girl. Hey, don't make fun of me, Mr. 37. I've been trying to figure out your secret. Yeah? Come up with anything? Three times seven is 21. 21 stands for the Hebrew word ehieh. You know what it means? "I am" or "I exist". I like that one. ♪ When the world flies by outside your window ♪ ♪ do you feel tongue-tied? ♪ ♪ Reach out, feel the wind blow ♪ Can I tell you something, angel? Anything. Angel, I’m a rockstar. I don't know how much longer I'll be around. We're the perfect match. Would you... Would you marry me? Are you serious? Dead. Yes. I think it's stupid. You're both behaving like children. Christina... We want you to be at our ceremony. We want you to be our witness. I love you and I’d love you to be there so hopefully you'll be there. Fine... Well, if you guys are really going to do this then yes, of course I'll be there. Oh, my god. Are you alright? Yeah, it's just, um, my right side. Has it been bad today? Yeah. It's getting hard to read, to turn the pages. Why didn't you say something? I don't know. The cortisone was working for a while and I just didn't want to say anything. It's gonna get better, okay? Promise. Don't promise me that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just going to go clean up. Any word on the MRI? Not yet. The long and short of it is the MRI came back quite normal, Jemma. That's good. That's great news. Well, actually an MRI in these cases are used to eliminate other possibilities. I'm just not seeing any. Your muscle biopsy came back consistent with initial diagnosis. Wait, what? What are you saying? I'm afraid to say that the initial diagnosis of ALS is accurate. Just like that? That's it? You're gonna die, go settle the bill with the receptionist? What the fuck? I've actually been having quite a bit of muscle pain lately. I'm going to give you something to deal with that. How's your nausea? It's getting worse. At least this entitles you to the good stuff. Why do I see even more needles in my future? So, closing in on the big release. Only eight weeks left. Everything still copacetic with the contracts? All good. Great. So what brings you in today? Well, um, I’m getting married. Hey! Congratulations! I didn't read about it in the press. No, private, private wedding. Hush hush. Sure, of course. So what are we talking about here, pre-nup? No? No pre-nup? No pre-nup. I want to amend my will. She's, uh... Well, there's some health concerns and if anything were to happen to me... You know? I just want to make sure she's taken care of. Of course. Alright, let's get started. What's she get? Everything. She gets it all. You okay? Yeah, I'm good. Alright. Do you, Adam, take this stunning woman, beautiful through and through, to be your lawfully wedded wife, through sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live? I do. Woo! Do you, Jemma, take this soulful singing poet to be your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, as long as you both shall live? I do. Whoo! Yeah! I need the rings. I didn't want to lose it. By the power vested in me by Yahweh and wendigo, Jesus, Buddha, Allah, John Lennon, and system of a down... I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss your fuckin' bride. Look at the gulls. It's beautiful. Thank you for coming down and finding, you know, time for us. I thought we were family. Congratulations. Oh, you smell great. You did it. Are you hiding? Maybe a little. It's been a big day. How are you feeling? Exhausted. But it's my wedding day. Is there something else? What's wrong? I just wish mom could have been here. I know. She would have loved to have been here. Would have made her really happy. Me, married to a rockstar? Well... Adam would have won her over. He's a good guy. Sure you don't want a rockstar yourself? Uh, jury's still out on the rest of them. The fangirl kind of scares me a little. It means a lot to me that you came. Are you kidding me? Adam Webb happy, married, free from his demons, even for a moment. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. She looks good on you. But if you ever change your mind you know where to find me. It's never gonna happen, Dani. But I'm putting your song on the album. Really? Yeah. That's amazing. Well, cheers to that. And to you guys. Thank you. Brother! I told you to avoid marriage like the plague and what'd you go and do? I'm ashamed of you. Hey, hey, it actually gave me a little hope. Really? Yes! What? I'm not losing you both on the same night. Drink up. Cheers to that. We should fill that up and do it again. Yeah, let's do it again. One to go? Now wait a minute... You gotta go. That's it? That's it, man. That's the best I can do, brother. Take care of my girl. She's my girl now. Oh, wow. Dr. Koehl was right. This is good shit. I don't know why I didn't ask for this in the first place. Jemma... Pretty soon I'm not even gonna be able to speak. And while I still can I want to stay stoned and make love. Rage... Rage against the dying of the light. You ever think about killing yourself? It's crossed my mind. Why do you ask? I don't know, I just... You really think you rot in hell if you do? Maybe that's why you do it, so that you rot in hell. Luckily I don't believe in hell. ♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah ♪ She sounds like an angel. Dani's great. ♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah ♪ Dani, that's it. We're wrapped. Ow! Amazing.

I'm biased but, yeah, it's gonna be pretty sensational. Wow. He's a genius. Adam? He's pretty good. But you're a Saint for putting up with his ass. Can I ask you a favor? You really sounded incredible. Aw, thank you. I'm so psyched you were able to come out tonight. Yeah, me too. Wanna dance? You're joking, right? Nope. The album is amazing. It's all you, angel. Oh! I'm sorry. Hold me. Let's go. Do me a favor, birthday boy? Of course. Read me a few pages from my book. Sure. "He was the nearest thing to a dead man on earth. He was a dead man with a mind that could still think. He knew the answers that the dead knew and couldn't think about. He could speak for the dead because he was one of them". Keep reading. Jemma... Keep reading. Go to the next marked page. "In any event, there you are, breathing and thinking and dead like a frog under chloroform. So quiet, so helpless, yet still alive". It's about a soldier. He's lost everything in an attack. His arms, his legs, his eyes, his ears. His voice. And he's all alone and isolated inside of himself and he's trying to find a way to communicate with the people who are keeping him alive. He's trying to tell them that he wants more than anything to die. I've been thinking a lot about your brother lately. Jemma... Adam, I can't... I can't do this. My body is falling apart. It's getting worse all the time. Pretty soon I'm gonna be rolling around in a wheelchair and... then what? Then I'll be in a bed not even able to move, not able to speak. Just my eyes moving around in my head. In a prison. Jemma... stop. I'm ready to go. Adam... I want to die. Now. While I’m still me. Will you help me? Will you help me free myself? I can't do that. Yes, you can. You did it for James. For James? He didn't ask me to do that. I murdered him. No, you saved him. You freed him from his suffering. Please. Help me. Help do the same for me. No, Jemma. No. Are you okay? Was it the guys from Lee street again? Terry said he was gonna beat me up if I caught the ball. Don't worry about him. I'll protect you. Promise? Always. You're my brother. I trust you. Now come on. Let's get back to the team. I lied to you. I lied. October 25th, tomorrow... Tonight at midnight... I made a vow to kill myself when I turned 37 to exonerate me for what I did. I exist. Well, I no longer exist. Let's go together, Jemma. There's no life without you. No, no... Adam, no! Live! Live... First man... Make music. Live for me. For us. Happy birthday, Adam. I love you. I love you. No! I'm going to do this with or without you. Okay. I'll help you. Oh... Adam... It's so beautiful. The ocean... It's.. So.. Beautiful. I love you. I love you, angel. Oh, Adam... My gift... No more pain. I'm sorry for your loss, Ms. Johnstone. She left a note for you. It says that there's something in here that only you would know. I'd appreciate if you could verify that for me? Of course. This is from her, I'm positive. She was suffering. Happy birthday, man. Where the hell are you? I left you like 18 messages. Are you still alive? Anyway, we did it. Rolling stone wants to do a cover story. How's that for a present? Call me. The sunless sea. You know, Coleridge wrote it after he smoked opium. It all came to him in a vision - the pleasure dome, the sunless sea. He was in the middle of writing it all down when someone stopped by for a visit and when he went to finish the poem he realized he'd already forgotten the dream it was based on. Don't forget, Adam. Let me tell you the end of the poem because it's beautiful and terrifying and lately because it's made me think of you. "A damsel with a dulcimer in a vision once I saw it was an Abyssinian maid and on her dulcimer she played singing of mount Abora could I revive within me her symphony and song to such a deep delight 'twould win me that with music loud and long I would build that dome in air that sunny dome! Those caves of ice! And all who heard should see them there and all should cry beware! Beware! His flashing eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle 'round him thrice and close your eyes with holy dread. For he on honeydew hath fed and drunk the milk of paradise". ♪ I'm on my way ♪ heaven caught my eye ♪ ♪ one last wish in the last place that I lie ♪ ♪ time has come to leave just for now ♪ ♪ you'll find peace somehow ♪ ♪ don't be afraid ♪ ♪ I hear it's better where I go ♪ ♪ we have to trust in all that we don't know ♪ ♪ time has come to leave you just for now ♪ ♪ you'll find peace somehow ♪ ♪ sleep, as the lights go out on the world outside ♪ ♪ and walk on a golden beach to a morning tide ♪ ♪ see all the little things ♪ ♪ the dreams that set you free ♪ ♪ be all you can be for me ♪ ♪ you'll be so sad, I know, for a time ♪ ♪ but soon you'll smile ♪ ♪ when your heart remembers mine ♪ ♪ the times we had, they will always be ♪ ♪ a gift in your life from me ♪ ♪ sleep, as the lights go out on the world outside ♪ ♪ and walk on a golden beach to a morning tide ♪ ♪ see all the little things ♪ ♪ the dreams that set you free ♪ ♪ be all you can be for me ♪ ♪ be all you can be for me ♪
