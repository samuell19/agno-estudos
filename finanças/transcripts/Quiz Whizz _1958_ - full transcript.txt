[♪♪♪] ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ ♪ Hello ♪ STOOGES: Hello. [♪♪♪] The headlines are out. He won the money last night. Why didn't he come home? I can't figure out how he ever answered five questions correctly. It was all about food, wasn't it? If it's one thing he knows, it's food. He's always eating. But where is he? He's gotta split that money with us three ways. We financed him. Yeah. Hey. Maybe he ran out on us. Oh, yeah. Maybe. Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh! Oh, Larry. Pour me some water. I'm too nervous. Wait a minute. Here. [GARGLES] [SPUTTERS] I was just thinking. Maybe he was held up. He may even be laying in an alley somewhere bleeding to death. Oh, poor Joe. I better call the police department. I'll get some coffee to quiet our nerves. Hello, police department? I want to report a holdup. And a murder. The victim's name? Joe Besser. Good morning, Moe. Good morning. Uh, description? Well, he's about 220 pounds. Height? About 5'5" by 5'5". Color of hair? Skin. He was wearing a-- Never mind! He's here! Why didn't you tell us you were here? Ooh, I'm no snitch. Larry, Joe is here. Hey, Joe, let's see the check. What check? I haven't gotten the check. Don't tell me you cashed it. Oh, what do you think, I'm an idiot or something? Of course I didn't cash it. [BOTH CHUCKLE] He didn't cash it. Of course not. I invested it. Joe, don't tell me. You bought the Brooklyn Bridge. Certainly not. [SIGHS] That was sold last week. [FRAGMENT CLINKS] I invested all our money in consolidated Fujiyama California smog bags. Filled with smog. Oh, consolidated Fujiyama California sm-- Smog bags! Why, you idiot, you let them gyp you! Not so loud! I ought to blow the brains out of your empty skull. No, Moe, are you crazy? You can't shoot him here. We could never dispose of that body. You're right. Never mind, I want to get him anyhow! Wait-- Oh, look what you did. You, uh-- Ought to give you the hot face, that's what I'll do. [BANGING ON DOOR] MAN: Hey, hey, hey. Hey, who's that? Call your shots, will you? Who are you? J.J. Bigby's the name. Bureau of Internal Revenue. Income tax to you. Which one of you won that $15,000? STOOGES: He did. The government would like a check from you for $5900. Uh, well, how about 50 cents on the count? Yeah, on account of that's all we've got. No levity, please. If payment is not immediately forthcoming, we will be forced to-- Oh, wait, wait. We'll bring it to you in person. Plus $10 for a new hat. Here, never mind. Have mine. It doesn't fit. Oh, it looks perfect. Sure. I can't see. Well, rent yourself a seeing eye dog. Now, we gotta get our money back from that stock swindler. Tell us about him. Well, his name is John Smith. Don't tell me he introduced you to Pocahontas. Somebody told you. Quiet. Now, where is this John Smith? In his office next door to a barbecue pit. Hey, does barbecues have pits? No. What are you hitting me for? I didn't say it, he said it. Quiet-- Oh, you said it. No. No, I didn't-- [MOUTHING WORDS] Yes? Incidentally, do barbecue have pits? Quiet. We gotta find that Smith guy. Come on. Wait there. Come on. Come on. There it is. "G.Y. Prince. R.O. Broad." "G-Y-P." "Gyp. Rob." What'd you expect? Ooh. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] JOE: Open up. It's Joe Besser. It's the fat guy I sold the stocks to. We've got to let him in. Put on your disguise so they won't recognize you. [DOORKNOB RATTLING] MOE: Come on, open up! Okay, let them in. That crook won't let us in. Let's break the door down. Good idea. Ready, set, go! STOOGES: Whoa! [GLASS SHATTERS] Where is John Smith? We threw that crook out. Yes, he gypped some poor man of his TV winnings last night. So we fired him. Yeah, we're the guys he gypped. Let's go to the police. We'll have them catch that crook. Wait a minute, boys. You look like nice fellows. So we're going to take care of you. Oh, boy. They're going to take care of us. Yes. There's an eccentric old millionaire who's very lonely. He would like to adopt some nice boys. His name is Montgomery M. Montgomery. Oh, boy. We'll be Montgomery's wards. Correct. Now, here's all you have to do. Now, we'll make all the arrangements... Yes, G.Y. I've canceled our opera tickets and I understand. I'm supposed to adopt them. Correct. And then, of course, give them the usual treatment. Oh, have no trepidations. You can rely on me. Dead men tell no tales, eh? [LAUGHS] Goodbye. New customers, eh? [DOORBELL RINGS] I'm Mr. Montgomery's secretary. STOOGES: Hello. What nice boys. You're not so bad yourself. Catch. Remember, you're supposed to be a kid. So I'm a juvenile delinquent. Yeah. Get out of here, you. [CRIES] What's the matter? He hit me on my little cheek. Oh, Lisa will kiss it. And here too.

[COUGHS] Come on, get out of here. They're trying to kill us. Kill us? Oh! You should never have hit them with that bat. That would never kill them. But the rat poison will. Be sure to pour plenty in. Right. They must be stiff as planks when Prince and Broad arrive to claim the bodies. They're murderers. Let's get out of here. Keep an eye on the door.
