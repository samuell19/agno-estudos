(VOICEOVER): I know revenge for his murder will give me some shred of my life back. Make me feel decent again. Like walking into a room, finding my old self tucked away in a drawer, waiting for the light. -Before when I was scared, I used to remind myself that I was a reporter and they don't kill us easily. We know people right? But it wasn't enough. The government crumbled. I couldn't control my fear. So I cooperated. The way that scared people do. I wrote what they wanted. Sent innocent men to prison. I played ball. Now the monster I helped create has sentenced me to die. [MUSIC PLAYING] -But first I'm going to kill a man. He killed the one decent thing I still looked up to. -I know you. -It's all right. [GASPS] -You won't be here for long. -No one ever is. -Good. You made it. Now remember your promise. -A boy. A simple boy who wouldn't cooperate. [COUGHING] -(WHISPERING) Who's this? -I've made a promise to avenge his murder and it's the one promise I'm going to keep. For revenge is all I have left. [BIRDS CHIRPING] -Is there any water? -One's supposed to be yours? -What am I supposed to do with it? [MUSIC PLAYING] -He likes you. -Who? -Elias. -Elias is going to like a lot less of me. He's gonna wish he never heard my name. -Good. Then you won't mind. My guess is they don't feed you. -Give me that rabbit! -This is probably easier. That how they punish people who are already in solitary? Huh? No food? I suppose I ask for another potato from now on. -No! -Because they don't know you're here. If it's one potato a day, both of us won't last. -I've survived a year. Elias he brought you that. Why? I mean he's cunning. Brilliant actually. If he wasn't a psychopath. He wants to control you. You've gotta show him that it doesn't mean anything. Give me the rabbit and I'll tell you how to survive in here. -What's this? --[INAUDIBLE] It's in the ceiling. See, they're all held up by the weight of each one pressing against the other. There. Now we need seven of them. -And the ceiling collapses and then we're killed. Good plan. -No. A controlled collapse. One at a time. You can help me. Yeah. -I'm busy. -You're busy huh? Do you know why no one escapes from here? Huh? Last year when the rains came this entire prison flooded. Every cell, every man, waist deep in water. No sleep. No food. And snakes. And [INAUDIBLE]. See they're smart. Somehow they know, they know to wait until the men are week. -You're lying. -Yeah. I stay up here on this beam and I watch the water get higher and higher. See it comes in under that wall first. It starts a couple inches, then a foot. Then three feet and four feet. It keeps getting higher. And higher. And the rain keeps coming day after day. Almost like God is still rehearsing that ark thing. Then they stop feeding us. And you can hear the cries of the men asking for food. Then there's the quiet. And the snakes, they gorge. I saw it. I saw the constrictors-- -Stop it! -In the future why don't you try to draw the least amount of attention to this cell, do you understand me? See I was lucky to find food. I was lucky to have this cell to hide in. I was lucky enough to find this. Seven stones. And the whole ceiling comes down. -So your escape is to tear this place down? -I want this place to die! -All the men that have been killed year after year. -Destroying the one cell isn't going to tear this prison down. -OK. So maybe it's a little symbolic OK? My wife. She always said I was a little grandiose. But I'm getting out. -You're not the only one with a plan. -[INAUDIBLE] -I'd be a fool to trust you. -I could kill you. -Nice try. But I'm already dead. So did you ever hate someone? So completely. So fully. That killing him would trigger as much remorse as accidentally stepping on an ant? -Well you said accidentally. Maybe I would have thought that you were hopeless. -And you realized? You're no longer capable of remorse. So you're just like him. You act so tough. -What did you do to get thrown in here? -I've become dangerous. -And you said that you were here to kill someone? Who? -I'm here to kill Elias. -[LAUGHS] Right. -No! I'll get food for you. Please don't kill him. I'm tired of everything dying. -Well then I suggest that you don't listen. Or you could forget about Elias and help me. -I didn't come here to help you! -I didn't come here to eat this rabbit. What happened to I'm tired of everything dying? -What [INAUDIBLE] do you have to get back to, huh? By the time you get thrown in here you got nothing left. -That's not true. See, I was a writer. You can't take that away from me. -Yes they can. -See. I wrote children's stories. But the government, they thought it was subversive. I refused to write their version of what a children's story should be. When politics go bad eventually we all become prisoners. -Even authors of children's books. Anyway you would have eventually gotten into trouble. Everybody did. -So what did you do out there? You don't look like a subversive. You don't have the look. -Anything but. Opposition to the political party. -No. -You're going to have to help me out here. -School teacher. I was a school teacher. -So you saw these boys disappearing first hand. Boys being turned into soldiers. Being taught how to kill, and you just had to do something. -You must have been watching me the whole time. -You don't know Elias. He's smart. That's how he survived in the shark tank. The only thing these boys understand is power. It's about who has it. Who doesn't. -Elias doesn't understand justice either. He will. -I need to find my son. -I lived in this aided community. [INAUDIBLE] community. Anyway, the whole time there was this boy. This homeless kid. Always [INAUDIBLE]. He never bothered me. -When was this? -Things were bad. Boys started showing up with guns. I saw them kill. My boy wouldn't kill. Then I saw him. I saw him. I knew they were being used. I knew I [INAUDIBLE]. -How did you help? -I knew he disappeared. Then I saw him. He wouldn't cooperate. Wouldn't kill. So they killed him. I saw his head on the end of a pole. Warning the other boys. And then I found out Elias killed him. -Elias? He killed my son? And they dragged me here a year ago? I didn't get to say goodbye. My son was at school. -It wasn't your son. -How do you know that? How do you know anything? -Listen to me. I'm Laura Brummels. -You're not a school teacher. You're the reporter. -There has to be a God. Because who else would turn things like this on me? I lied awake night after night. Why didn't I do something? Why did I cooperate? I'm like everyone else hoping things would get better. Hoping just a bit more. -You're the one who sent me here! Why should I believe anything you say? -Because I'm here now too! -Ah! -It was your choice to leave the way you did. I didn't chase you down. I didn't go after you until I was directly ordered to. I knew all along you were leading the opposition. I kept my mouth shut. And then you wrote that stupid book! Children don't pick up books to learn politics. -They wanted to know why people were disappearing! I thought that it would be brave. -How's that working for you? Your book is no where, and you're here. -Better life for my son. -What do you think his life is like now? You've been here over year! Everything. Your house. Your wife. All of it's gone! -[INAUDIBLE] -She resisted you! Yeah. -I'm getting out of here. I don't need your help. The rains are going to come. You think you're tough. The strongest swimmers drown. [THUNDER] -Clear out. Where's your little friend? -Who? -The one I gave you. You see. I gave you a pet in contemplation of friendship. -Why be friends with me? [GASPS] -It was a gift! Why don't you want to be friends with me? [STRUGGLING] [THUNDER] -[INAUDIBLE] -Hell of a consolation. -You would have killed him. -You would have under the opposition. Seven stones. You're a fool. The only rocks in this place are in your head! And I wonder who's going to go to hell. Hey! Hey! I want someone in here with me! -Bitch! -They're going to kill you. -What am I the one that you came to kill? Is that it? [THUNDER] -Bring me a [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE] -There's going to be a prison break. All of you are going to die. Including Elias. -I doubt anything could kill Elias. -Perhaps? But if they try and he survives. You knew about it. -Damn right there's going to be a prison break. He's crazy you know that? He probably played with scissors as a kid. If you think that you're going to lure him in here and then yell to me to help, you can forget about it. -Yeah, I got that idea about you last night. -I gotta get out of here. That's right. You're late for a revolution. You don't want to ruin your plan. So you sacrificed me. -I would do anything to see my son. -Everything you're doing you're doing because you hate me. -I did something to you? My son is God knows where and lonely. And you put me here! You got something on your mind but it's not hate. -You want me to die? OK. I'm going to die. But on my way out, I'm going to fix this. Make one thing right! -[INAUDIBLE] Help me. You don't want to die here. -What are you doing? Making friends? You didn't come here for that. You have to do this. You have to kill him. He deserves it. He killed me! -Shh. You made a promise. -Calm down. --[INAUDIBLE] If that's what you want. -OK. -You're so strong. I used to admire you. You gave the boys a sense of home. Belonging. Nobody ever thanked you for that. And sometimes, they didn't obey. So you had to discipline them, right? Otherwise. -Otherwise -You'd have nothing. Like what you have now. -Nothing. -You feel it. -They're afraid of me. -No. They just hate you. I hate you. For what you did. And who you are. -The other boys tell me stories of how their dad beat them. How their mothers would put their hands in boiling water as punishment. And they're filled with rage and anger. And I can't stop feeling. I don't feel sorry for them. It feels good. When their stories are bad it's good that whatever happened to them makes them perfect for me. I'm just as bad as they are now. Worse. -And you're feeling lonely. -My parents were loving. I got everything. They never hit me. What the hell happened? But I am going to enjoy every second of this. I know this won't last. Power this great can never last. This is my time. -You're evil. -You don't think I know what you did? I know who you were. -I did this to survive. You did this to keep your home. Your lifestyle. That's what you wanted. You put men in here to keep that. -You killed a boy! -There will probably be more. This ain't over. But you're evil just like me, which makes you perfect. Don't you think? Ah! -Ah! [THUNDER] [CRYING] -You did it. He deserved it. Nobody's ever defended me. Ever. -No. (CRYING) He's killed my friend. -You killed him for me. -No. I killed him for you. [CRYING] -[INAUDIBLE] Which one? Help me. (VOICEOVER): Seven. Seven. -Ugh! [RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (VOICEOVER): I spent so much time in the dark. So what changed? I suppose I had to learn how powerful courage could be. I suppose I had to learn how to tell myself the truth. I got to thinking about all the people whose lives I ruined. And it's not killing that's going to take that away. Finally, I defended someone for the first time. Courage isn't about winning. It's about doing. And what I'm going to do, Joseph, is find your son. I want him to know how you saved me from the dark. [MUSIC PLAYING]
