Woman: Kenny, Lisa, please come to the amtrak information window. Your car is waiting. I'm Agatha weiss. I asked for a limousine. A stretch? Mmm. Yeah, there weren't any available. Hmm. Can you find this place? Yeah. Uh, cash call. I'm going to have to collect up front. It's 45 an hour. Two hour minimum. Here's 200, okay? Can we get the star home map? Kind of a waste. Unless you want to see where Ryan seacrest used to live. Where'd you come in from? Jupiter. Florida. What's happening in la? Visiting family. Do you drive a lot of celebrities? That was probably the heaviest for me. Um, I drove Tatum O'Neal when she had a reality show. Um, Chuck lorre, uh, created two and a half men. Get a lot of producers, directors. Uh, Juliette Lewis. She's a scientologist. I was thinking about converting, just as a career move. You're an actor? Uh... actor, writer. I know Carrie Fisher. Oh, really? How's that? I met her on Twitter. Yeah, we became, like, really good friends. I'm helping her with a new novel she's writing. But it might be something she winds up doing as an hbo show. What's this place? I thought it might be on the star map. There used to be a big house here. Childhood home of benjie weiss. How do you know that? I used to babysit for him. I was the original bad babysitter. That's weird. My agent's trying to get me an audition for babysitter 2. I mean, it's a long shot but, uh... Jakob leitner got it to me. He's a personal manager. He's a real heavyweight. We went to Beverly together. Got my fingers crossed. Hi, there. I didn't think you'd come. Why is that? You're so busy. Not for you. Hmm. L, um... I... i'liked bad babysitter. You were so funny. Yeah. Uh, we did 780 million worldwide. People don't realize that. Don't you have an iPad? No. Arnold, can we get her an iPad? A mini? We'll load it up. Watch shit in 3D. We got great satin crew jackets, "I was a bad babysitter" written in gold on the back. Get your swag on. So... How'd you get aids, cammy? Um, I don't have aids. It's non-hodgkin's lymphoma. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna make a movie of your life. All right? Ryan gosling will play me, and I'll play you. Be my date at the oscars? Non-hodgkins? Sorry about that. What the fuck's non-hodgkin's? I think it's a blood thing. I mean "non," it eitheris oritisn't. Were you serious in there? Because we can definitely get this to Ryan. It's just the kind of stuff he likes to do... "We can get it to Ryan"? Yeah. You can barely get toilet paper to your ass. It would make for an uplifting drama, wouldn't it? I mean, I've even got a title, it's a horrible life. If you're not serious, benjie, it's better not to promise. Ha! Arnold "kubler-Ross" has spoken. Great rabbi of death and dying. Man of wisdom. Zen fucking Archer. I've got a new nickname for you, museum of tolerance. Drop it, benjie. Drop it? I have a better idea. Why don't you show me your cunt? Huh? I know you have one. Jew faggot. What are they offering? Five million. Ten points from cash break. What's genie asking? Eight. Twenty from dollar one. What do you think? I think we have their balls. Cool. So, um, when's the audition? It's not an audition, benjie. I told you that. Right. Sorry. When's the urine test? The meeting is on Friday at 10:00. The studio just wants to see that you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. But the deal is contingent on the meet? They just wanna protect the franchise. I am the franchise. Go0-goo ga-joob. Go00-goo ga-joob. Cristina: Stafford, are you going to eat? I was listening to a very interesting tape of the Dalai Lama on the way home. Say what you like about politics, the man is a pro. Free Tibet! Tibet is not free. Tibet is very expensive. I have the receipt from Amazon to prove it. Anyhow, Buddhists say a prayer at mealtime... Is genie going to be there? Cristina: She thinks it's better not. Benjie: I want her there. "Pray that those that eat, "the things that are eaten and the actual eating "be universally devoid of self." Don't you love it? I'm going to my room. Go0-goo ga-joob. Stafford: Don't, mama. Don't, mama. Don't hurt me like that... Don't hurt me like that. Don't come into my room at night... Don't... Don't come into my room... When I'm sleeping... Don't come into my room when I'm sleeping. I won't let you anymore... I won't let you anymore. You mother-fucker... You mother-fucker! You, you hurt me. How? How did I hurt you? I... I was your little girl. I was your little girl and, and you hurt me. Why did you do it, mama? Because your parents hurt you? That's not good enough! Come on, Havana, stop forgiving. I don't... I don't care what they did to you. L, I wish they'd killed you. I'd... I'd kill you myself, mama. How, how could you do that to a child? How could you do what you did to me? I wanna be free, Clarice. I wanna be free. Clarice, mama, set me free. Mama, mama, set me free. I will be free. I will take back the years you stole. Please. Please. Please. Please... I'm gonna press on a personal history point. Everything's stored in the thighs. Okay. Okay... Take back the years, Havana. Take back the years she stole from that little girl. Young intern: Rebecca, we need to stop. You're a patient here. I want to help you, not make things... Rebecca: You don't think I set those fires, do you? Young intern: / think that you didn't mean to. You need help, that's all. Don't you want to help me? Not like this... I think that we need to think about what we're doing. "On all the flesh that says yes, "on the forehead of all my friends, "on every hand held out, "I write your name." Ms. Havana... it's Ms. genie. An! How are you doing, baby? Oh, I'm okay. I had a really heavy session with Stafford. Oh... That is so brave, what you do. It doesn't feel brave. I need a new chore-whore. What do you mean? What happened to adagio? Uh, I had to fire her. You're kidding. What happened? She was stealing. Adagio? Oh, god. I don't believe it. Yeah, yeah. She took some money and a ring I got last year in Paris and some Vicodin. Oh, my god. What? And you caught her? Mmm-hmm. So, what, did you call the police? Yeah, I told her I would if she didn't go to rehab. Oh, I see, so she's there now, huh? Yeah, with all the other dope-fiend personal assistants. They have their own wing. Okay, well, I'll call Carrie again. No. Love her, love Carrie, but don't bother her with this shit. Oh, she'll think it's hilarious. I'm meeting her later at the jj thing. She'll give me some names. So, um... What's going on with stolen waters? Well, I called vita. But, you know, they're all at Sundance. Yeah! Everyone but me. I gave the best reading of my life, genie. I went in there and I blew everyone away. I know. I know. I mean, you know, the only thing I can think of is that, uh, maybe they have some concerns about the perception of stunt casting. Everything is stunt casting. Havana, this is a movie, and not a great one, that your mother made 30 years ago. No. No, but it could be. It could be great. It's a... it's a re-imagining. It's a fucking art film. I mean, who do you think came up with the idea of my mother looking back on the making of stolen waters if she had lived? I did. I did. I mentioned it to Damien four years ago on mustique. I know, I know... They should give me the part, and, and a producer's credit, too. I mean, this role was made for best supporting. It's, it's, it's a fucking second chance. And it's, it's Damien javitz. He totally resurrects actors. And I went in there and I killed it. Is sterl still doing it? I introduced him to Harvey. And, you know, Harvey's producing. And I mean, I already talked to Harvey and he's gonna talk to Damien. But, you know, Harvey's Harvey, but sterl can talk to Damien. You know, we are doing everything we can. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's an art film. I mean, it would be great if you got the job. But, in case you're not aware, your mother is a dead cult figure. And Damien javitz ain't pt Anderson. I mean, there's so many movies out there! Yeah? Where? Yeah, big deal movies! Where? Where? Where, genie? Do you know what Jakob said to me the other day? He said that because I know so many celebrities I should consider becoming a manager. Do you know... Do you know how it felt for me to hear that? Look, everything I am doing, everything in my life and in my therapy is to get this part. Oh! Ow! What's wrong? What's wrong? Ow, cramps. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. Mother-daughter incest is so '80s overkill. Anne sexton, I am not. Oh, my god, oh, my god. The shock will wear off. What's the matter, Havana? Did you think it would be like the sixth sense, with the dead clamoring to be heard? Do you know what the dead clamor for? You know what hell is? A world without narcotics. What's happening, what's happening? The worst pornographic cliché, vana, this childhood rape fantasy. Get a life. Or maybe you should get a death. Isn't it pathetic enough that you want to play me? You hate me. But yet you're desperate to be me? You want that role but you're not gonna get it. You don't even have the chops. I did. And I was young and gorgeous. You? With your shitty tits and that used up old hole? It stinks worse than me! Who is it? It's non-hodgkin's. What are you doing here? "On my school notebooks, "on my desk and the trees, "on the sand and the snow, "I write your name." I, I'll make the movie, if that's why you're here. I don't know what Arnold told you. "On all the flesh that says yes, "on the forehead of my friends, "on every hand held out, "I write your name." "On my school notebook, "on my desk and on the trees, "on the sand and the snow, "I write your name. "On all the flesh that says yes, "on the forehead of my friends, "on every hand held out, I write your name. "Liberty." So we're back-to-school with bad babysitters. Is this detention? No way. You're top of the class. We understand you had a rocky summer vacation. A productive one. It wasn't easy for any of us. But he's learned a lot. Absolutely. Yeah, listen. I went through that whole drug thing myself. I mean, not at your age, mind you, but, uh, hey, shit happens. Right? It just, uh, happens a lot earlier than it used to. Benjie's done a lot of growing up. Yes, he has. Uh, on the last season of praise the lourds I was making $300,000 a week. I was nine years old. How psychotic is that? Crazy money. For anyone. But worth every penny. You've got a tremendous fan base out there. I just didn't have the skills. That kind of income would fuck up Mother Teresa. She's already fucked up. She's dead. That's how fucked up she is. We have a mandate, Cristina knows this. And I, I know you do, too. We have to protect the franchise. Go0-goo ga-joob. Hank: We kept things quiet last year. Arnold, your people were terrific. Nothing from the tabloids. Yeah, still, you know, an adult in recovery can be a career-booster. A child is something else. I think we understand that, Jeb. Though it didn't hurt drew, hmm? Guys, we're on your side. Please understand that. I don't think we'd all be in this room if we didn't feel a certain level of trust. Do we have a budget yet? Fifty-eight. But that's strictly in-house. Now, we lost Elle, but um, she's not someone we were counting on. We're closing with Emma Watson for the young mom, so, uh, that should be fun. We need to know the circumstances of benjie's rehab. Uh, benjie detoxed at a private home. The ranch of my husband's partner. Kick-ass mom you got there. Mmm. She knows how to hit without leaving marks on the body. Shh... oh... Fuck! Oh! I will never be humiliated like, like that again. Oh... never. It's over, baby. We have them. Did Damien say I was too old? Mmm-mmm. The casting people? Sarah horowitz? Havana, come on. The part's just written younger. Sarah horowitz cast me in my very first movie. Hmm. Probably saw that thing I did on tnt for money. Yeah, well, don't do anything for money. Yeah, well, we all haven't been as smart as you. You gonna support me on this, sterl? You gonna support me with Damien? Look, you know I will. I think he's taking a hard look at azita wachtel. Azita wachtel? Well, she's nominated for an Oscar and she's Canadian. Canada's co-funding. Do you know what azita wachtel's story is? You know what she's known for? She used to let producers stick their cocks in her ass and pee. Good to know. Look, you have a relationship with Damien. Yeah. I have three calls into him but he won't return. You gave a great reading. He tell you that? He said you were very strong. He did? He said that? Yes. Oh, my god! Oh, sterl, I have to get this part. We'd be so great together. Well, I thought we already were. Diandra? Oh, my god, she's old. Hey, did you know she's, like, 237 imdb says she's 16. How do you know she's 237 her labia's pierced. You got to be 23 to have your labia pierced? No, she's got a tramp stamp, okay? She's menopausal. Hey, nice girls, huh? Oh my god, Rhett, did you tell him? Oh, benjie, you won't believe this. No, no, no. It's too fucking weird. I'm not going to. Now I'm getting interested. Okay, so there's this crazy girl, right? She posted, like, 6,000 messages on my Facebook fan page in, like, two months. Sounds like marriage material. You should just fuck her, Rhett. Or eat her on her period. Come on. Don't be vulgar. Yeah, Rhett won't even do that to me. Well, he can't because your menopausal. Oh! Shut up! Would you guys chill? Come on. All right, so production company looks into it, finds out a teamster's been selling this chick my shit for, like, $3,000. Excuse me. Your shit? Yeah, you heard it right, girl. My shit. He's got some expensive doodie. It's got rice in it from, uh, nob... Ew! But like out of a honey wagon? No. I mean, when the guy comes in with the hose to empty, you know... What is she doing with it? Stockpiling. For that rainy day. Like, where does she get the money? Sludge fund. Oh, benjie, you are so sick! There are some days, actually I ran specials when I had diarrhea, so it just... Summer clearance. Everything must go! Ew! Oh, my god! Come... Who is that? Starla gent. Country singer. She won the voice? Oh, she's a runner-up. God, she is a wild woman. Uh, hell of an actress, as well. Didn't I tell you? Javitz cast her in the part you wanted. Shut up! Uh, I wonder if Blake Shelton peed in that butt. Hey, you like Sam? Hmm. You could totally fuck her. She wants to be in your movie. I hear she gives great oxy, too. I've almost got 90 days. Till what? Sobriety, dick-wad. Oh, my god, the human stench! That fat anchor-whore from tmz was in the bathroom. We saw her ankles. What was her name, again? Kayla: Oh, it was like something dead farted. Hey, isn't that sterl carruth? Oh, yeah, with Havana segrand. We have the same agent. Really? How old is she? Totally menopausal. Oh, beyond! She's near death. She's, like, older than my grandmother. No, she is a gmilf, a grandmother I'd like to fuck. Are they fucking? Uh, she'd be like a mercy fuck. Like when orderlies rape old people in nursing homes? Hey, didn't her mom die in a fire? Yeah. Like Jack Cassidy. Who's that? The prototypical swinger. David Cassidy's father. Who's David Cassidy? Shaun Cassidy's brother. You know, her mom was a really cool actress, as well. Um, Clarice Taggart? Yeah, a&e did a thing on her. She was really cool. She was young. Oh... What is that? Hey, Damien, what's happening? Yeah, yeah. I could totally wear two earrings. Love that. Um, maestro, I'm just, uh... I'm just here with the kids doing the whole bedtime story thing. Um, yeah, no, I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll call you right back first thing. Hey! Mention me when you talk. Sterl: You are so fucking crazed. Suck my dick and I'll put in a word. I loved you so much. You were such a beautiful little girl but you lied. How could you grow up to be a monster who lies? What the fuck? Sterl: Hey! What's happening? I'm sorry, it's... I just got uncomfortable. I guess I'm a lousy dyke. Why don't you take a klonopin? I know a man who lives under the sword of damocles we call aids. "When my time comes,” he told me, "I'll be ready. "My bags are packed and at the door." Up. I like that. I like that very much. There is a time in our lives and in our therapies when our eyes stray to the bags at the door. After we've wept. After we have suffered. After we have exhausted the fountain of memory and bloodied our hands on the walls of our parents' house. I thought that garry Marshall was going to be there, that it was a meet. I didn't know that I was going to have to read. And then they gave me the wrong drive-on and I had to walk, like, a mile. And I stank by the time I got there. And then the casting director, who I know, doesn't even acknowledge me. She just walks right by without saying a word. And, and then she tells me that she doesn't even know if garry knows that I'm coming in. Now, this is garry Marshall, not bertolucci. His movies don't make money anymore. And I know garry. And then she says they want to put me on tape. And I'm, like, "excuse me. "But you need special make-up for that "or you'll look green." Like it's all some pointless exercise. And I just can't take it anymore, Jakob. I'm so tired and it's so pathetic. Is that Carrie? Later, Jakob. Later. Hi, Carrie! Oh... Both: How are you? Oh, when I get in touch with myself, I'll let you know. It's been insane. Did you wrap? Well, we go back to Prague tomorrow to do re-shoots. Are you doing the javitz film? Oh, I hope so. Did you hear something? Well, genie told me you were up for it. That would be so amazing for you to play your own mother. I mean, every daughter should have that opportunity, right? Do you know Damien? Well, we just had dinner once in tangiers. Well, if you see him, tell him to hire me. Oh, genie told me about adagio. Uh! How long did she work for you? Three years. Are you still looking for a new assistant? Absolutely. You've become my employment agency. Would you do me a big favor? This is gonna sound bizarre, but would you interview this girl that I met on the Internet? I'm so nervous. Aw, it's okay. Would you like some tea? Oh, thank you. Yes. Your house is so beautiful. The walls are so thick, and those chimes. Oh, they're from a monastery in dharamsala. I met the Dalai Lama. He's a very cool man. He laughs a lot. He's actually just like someone you'd want to hang with, you know, but you can't 'cause he's the Dalai Lama. Thank you for the tea. Maria's at the hospital, my housekeeper. One of her girls is sick. She's got, like, you know, 40 kids. So, I guess you know why you're here. Because of Carrie? How did you guys start e-mailing? Well, she wrote on Twitter that she was researching for a new novel she was writing, about a burned girl. So, I wrote to her and then I met her at a star wars convention in Florida. Was that weird for you? I mean... She's so amazing. You know, she's such a funny, amazing person. Plus we're both dual disorder so we finish each other's sentences. So, you came out here to see her? I just wanted to see Hollywood. But she did take me to breakfast at the four seasons. Zooey deschanel was there. And Sally draper, the little girl from mad men. It was pretty amazing. Do you have family? In Florida. That's where I'm from. Agatha, um, can I ask about the burn? Uh, I was working at a planetarium after school. I was 12. There was an electrical fire and I ran into a storeroom, like a jerk. Hmm. Um, well, this isn't a very glamorous job. I'm not used to glamor. Mmm. You'd be like mostly running errands, going shopping and getting things fixed and... Ms. segrand, I would be the most loyal, most competent, most grateful personal assistant you've ever had. You don't have a car? But you drive? I have a valid Florida license. We can rent you a car. I think, maybe, a mustang or something? Carrie's funny. She knew I should meet you. Do you know how my mother died? No. In a fire. Oh... Agatha... I think you're beautiful. And do you know who looks just like you, inside? Havana segrand. You've got a request. What is it? Hollywood tour. Cash call. Holly crest hotel. "On my school notebook, "on my desk and on the trees, "on the sand and in the snow, I write your name. "On all the flesh that says yes, "on the forehead of my friends, "on every hand held out, I write your name. "Liberty." So, you were in a fire, right? You know, I never really figured out what happened. I think one night I got drunk and slept really hard on my face. So, now you hit tinseltown, what are you gonna do? Can't, uh, keep riding around in limos if you want to keep your money. Actually, I got a job. Oh, yeah? Where? Do you know Havana segrand? Sure. Know of. I'm her new personal assistant. That's the Carrie Fisher connection? Actually, it was. Havana's getting me a car. Hey, do you wanna have dinner on the weekend? Uh... um, yeah, this weekend's not good for me. L, I have to... I have to work on my script. I have a great idea for a movie. Maybe we could write it together. It's got an incest theme. I guess those are kind of overdone, huh? Sex abuse, the new religion! The truth is, my parents were brother and sister. I never tell anyone that. But I think it'd be cool. I mean, it's kind of "been there, done that." I know that sounds jaded but I think it would make a cool indie. You know, I wanna act in it. And you could, too. Mmm. I think it would be good if it wasn't pretentious. You know, if we got the whole mythological thing going on. Look, Agatha... I think you're a little crazy. Well? So? I mean, what I'm saying is, um, I'm kind of, kind of involved with someone. And, uh, I mean, uh, I hope everything works out for you. Look, I don't want to take the money. Fuck you. It was like a dream, but it seemed so fucking real. Go on. A girl, I, uh, met her at the hospital. We sent her an iPad but they said she died. And she came into my room at the house. Scared the shit out of me. Maybe it was a dream. Am I going crazy? No. But, I think it's probably time for you to start talking about certain things. My sister? Yes. She always, uh, wanted to "marry me." That's how we played. We did the ceremony. Isn't that strange? Do you think I'm crazy like her? No. But if we don't look at things they can make us crazy. Mom and dad were at some party. I was six or seven then. That night, the night it happened, we, uh, had the ceremony, the marriage thing. And, uh, she gave me pills. Vitamins, she said. And, uh, I woke up in the hospital. They pumped my stomach and the firemen carried me out of there and I never saw her again. Have you asked your parents about... They, they don't talk about her. They won't. That girl at the hospital... Harriet, what do I do? What do I do if she comes back? You call me. I'm afraid. Whenever I see her, it's so real. I don't want to be hospitalized. My career is so fucked as it is. Textbook tss, Havana. You saw heavy combat as a child. Could I be a "multiple"? I don't see that. But if you are, we'll deal with it. Damn her! What does she want? When you came out of hiding and externalized your shame, mother didn't like that. But what we can name, we can tame. She wants me to fail. But I won't. "I won't." That's little vana. Celebrate her. The imago-deity, that's what jung called it. We call it the "magical child." And that child will not fail. Lie down. I hired a girl. It's amazing. Why is it amazing? She's disfigured. She was burned in a fire... On her face. Where is she from? Florida. It's amazing. She just showed up on my doorstep. I get the sense that I'm working through something by hiring her. People don't just enter our lives randomly, we call them. Two women linked by fire. I'll bet those visions go away. Oh, god, do you think so? You're welcoming mom into the house. You're saying, "hey, ma, come on in. "You don't scare me. I'm empowered. "Soup's on! This is my house, ma. "I built it with my pain and my hope. "And you can't hurt me anymore. "Mi casa es su casa.” Mmm-hmm. Deep breath now, Havana. Breathe... What if she comes to the house? She won't. Then what is she doing here? Maybe she's sightseeing. Why are you so cavalier about this? We've always handled things differently, you and I. You've got to get her fired. And then what? If she's working for Havana we know where she is. And that buys us time. What if she tries to get to benjie? I'm more concerned about the tabloids. I'm about to go on a book tour, for Christ's sakes. Benjie: "On the marbles of nights, "on the white bread of days, "on the married seasons, I write your name. "On my school books, on my desk, "on the trees, on the sand and snow, "I write your name. "On all the flesh that says yes, "on the forehead of my friends..." Son? One second. Come in. I saw your light. I couldn't sleep. Me neither. Were you reading? Just boning up on the script. That's hard to do without a partner. Mum usually reads with me but, uh, I like to know the lines pretty well before we go over them. That's what makes you a pro. Listen, there's something I wanted to talk to you about. I'm not taking anything. Not even Seroquel. I've got a really good sponsor. He's been clean and sober for 20 years. He's worked with Robert downey Jr. Demi lovato. No. It's about your sister. We think she may be back. Here in Los Angeles. Did... did she call? She hasn't yet. I thought she was in prison somewhere. Hospital. Far away. But now she's free, white, and 18. The courts couldn't hold her. We're in the process of acquiring a restraining order against her. And I'd like you to tell me if she... A restraining order? Too bad you couldn't have gotten one when she was born. You could've had a judge standing by in the delivery room. Maybe you tried that. We tried a lot of things, benijie. Mostly we tried our best. That's in your book. That's a big thing in your book. Trying your best. It's supposed to give people major points. I don't know that girl anymore, son. Not that I ever did. I don't know if she's dangerous. I knew this day was coming. I thought somehow she'd just stay put. That was stupid of me. But I want you to tell me if she tries to see you. I'll tell you if she pops up. You know how me and you like to share. Get some sleep, son. "By the power of the word "I renew my life. "I was born to know you. "And to name you Liberty." Genie: Havana, sweetheart, I... I don't know if you've read the trades, but, um... They announced that Damien went with azita. I mean, I can't say it's a complete surprise, but, uh... I'm very angry at the way it was handled. I mean, it... it just makes me look foolish. But that's my problem, not yours. I'm so sorry, honey. Uh, I have calls into Damien. And I hate to be leaving this on your phone, I... [... I just didn't want you to hear it from someone else. As you know, I mean, I strongly think there's no love lost on this project. Those were always my feelings. I know and I respect the reasons but I think it's of equal importance we put this behind us. So, onward. I'm messengering six scripts to the house now! Lots of great stuff on the horizon. Call me as soon as you get this. I love you. And it's gonna be a great year! Made a hole in the wall so we'll be able to see everything. Everything? Or your money back. Oh, boy! I want to see her vuh-by-nuh. Director: And cut! Mr. vuh-by-nuh's getting all the laughs. He's only in four scenes. Yeah, and he's stealing every one of them. Piece of shit. Would you call genie? Call genie and tell her I want the little piece of shit flushed. And what are you doing here? Uh, I wanted to talk to you about something, not the studio's drug paranoia again? No, not the studio and their drug paranoia. Assistant director: Ready for you, benjie! Fuck off! I need something to eat. My blood sugar drops every time I do a scene with Mr. piece of shit vuh-by-nuh. Oh, ma, can you put one of those breakfast burritos in the microwave? Two minutes is perfect. Hey. How you doing? I'm cool. Thought you'd be working on your script. I wish I was. Got to pay the bills. How's show business? It's all right. Got a call-back for blue matrix. You watch it? Not into space soaps. Well, it's got a kind of Battlestar Galactica thing going on. Post 9/11. Can't believe I just spent $18,000. Let's go. Havana, this is Jerome. Hi. Agatha: He's a chauffeur. Wonderful. Jerome just got an audition for Battlestar Galactica. It's actually, uh, blue matrix. I'm a big fan. Aw, thank you. Well, um, good luck. Havana! Oh, my god! Azita! Thanks. On. Mmm, uh, Sydney just told me you were here. Uh, I was in the dressing room. Havana: I was gonna call you. Congratulations. Azita: Thank you, thank you. I'm so excited. Havana: You are gonna be so great. Azita: You think? And you're gonna love working with Damien. Yeah, he's so great. Um... Mmm. Havana! That makes me feel so good. Your mother was so special. It's gonna be a challenge for me. Do you know who's gonna play my mother when she was young? Anne. Hathaway. How's that gonna work? Oh, oh, you'd love Anne. Do you know her? She... she's amazing. Aw, just... just make it your own. You know, for a heartbeat... I really wanted to do it. Isn't that insane? Well, you should have! Yeah, but then I was like, "work it out in therapy, bitch!" Aw! He's so adorable! Aw. What's your name? Uh, this is Micah. Say hi to Havana. Hi, Micah. You are so sweet! My shy guy. Aw. What a heart breaker. Yeah. Yeah. Well, great to see you. Yeah, you, too. Ciao. Ciao. Um, back in 10. Okay. Come on, sweetie. Thank you, uma. Can you let yourself out? I like your new chore-whore. Awful phrase, isn't it? You two have alotin common. Like terrible men for one. "Hey, ma, I'm empowered. "Soup's on. "I'm a magical child, ma, so come on in. "Mi casa es su casa.” What do you want? This bravado of mine. It's asinine, and I'm sorry. It's just I'm nervous around you. It sounds comical, but I'm not used to being around people. I'm not gonna listen to this! Those incidents you keep sharing on the talk shows, they're false memories. Liar! From day one, liar! Your stepfather must have done those things to you. Why couldn't I see it? His first wife warned me that he was like that. You must have been so angry at me for not protecting you. Stay away from me. Stay... stay away. You blame yourself for the night I burned, don't you? "This is my house, ma. "I built it. "My pain, and my hope. "And you can't hurt me anymore." I'm sorry. I just got uncomfortable. I guess I'm a lousy dyke. Hi. Are you okay? I have the flu. I need cigarettes. American spirit, and, uh, I need you to pick up some prescriptions. Ambien... Vicodin, Xanax, Zoloft and astragalus, and goldenseal, and, um, yogi tea. Agatha, do you know Stafford weiss, the therapist? No. No. Of course, you don't. Why should you? I'm getting information from a fucking dead person. Tampax, I need Tampax, and, um, and... Kozy shack. You know what kozy shack is? It comes in these big tubs, like, tapioca, rice pudding. And truffles from Maison du chocolat. You can... you can get those at, um, at neiman's. And, um, come out to the yard. Um, I... I need... I need to move some plants. They've been like this since the fucking earthquake, and I just... I wanna move them over there. Don't worry about the tiles 'cause they're gonna be redone. So you can just drag 'em. They look so heavy. Don't make me into mommie dearest, okay? You're strong, you can do it. You're already wearing gloves. Just... just put your weight into it. No, swivel it, like this. Look, here, swivel. Genie: Hello? The door was open. What's happening? This hasn't hit the news yet. What? Azita wachtel's little boy died. No! I just saw them. He was with his dad in Ojai, and he drowned. My god! Micah! How? In the pool, I think. She wasn't there? I don't know. I mean, nobody knows yet, anything. But here's what's going on, and I know it's ghoulish, but I think we can get you to replace. But how? Well, azita's in the hospital. You know, she totally lost it. They had to sedate her. Won't they just shoot around her for a few weeks? There's no way she's going back to work. Well, how much have they shot? Uh, just a few days. The casting people called me three times. Sarah horowitz? Did you call back? Yeah. They wanna make an offer. Did Damien call? No, but, you know, he's probably consumed. What... Havana, they're not gonna make an offer without Damien's complete approval. No, azita should just do it. She should... she should work. She should go to the funeral, and then go right back to work. Yeah, I know, it's beyond, but do you still wanna do it? I need to talk to Damien. You will. But this just happened. I haven't been able to reach anyone. Don't come down from my quote. If they're really in trouble, we're in the catbird seat. Unless they're out to somebody else. I'll call you soon as I hear. Should I send flowers? You're not supposed to know. And save the flowers for Damien when we close. Ciao! Na na na na, na na na na hey, hey, hey, goodbye! Come on, sing it! Na na na na both: Na na na na hey, hey, hey, goodbye! This is for little Micah! Little miracles! Who's Micah? Fire and water. We're fire and he's water. Say goodbye. Bye! Na na na na goodbye, Micah. Na na na na goodbye, Micah! Fire and water. Say it. Both: Fire and water! - Hey, hey, hey, goodbye! - Hey, hey, hey, goodbye! Excuse me? I'm looking for Jerome Fontana. He had a call-back. He's a vorbalid? Try make-up. Jerome: Hey! What are you doing here? Havana's having lunch at the commissary. Thought I'd see if I could find you. Is it supposed to be a burn? No, I don't think so. I think it's a birthmark or something. We're half an hour away. Back to make-up and get some color on that thing. Damien: They did have a cover for the pool, but the motor was in the shop for repair. He didn't swim. Like, the father heard the phone and he thought it was azita, so he went inside for like two seconds... That's always how it happens. I mean, uh, that's always how you hear it happens. Mmm. Have you talked to azita? Uh, yeah. I went to see her. She's home now. I told her you were playing the part. She was relieved. Mmm. At least she seemed to be. I felt weird... Going there to tell her that. But we had become close. Anyway, listen, I... l was... I was gonna call you to tell you about my decision to go with azita, but things went crazy. You know, it's cool, Damien. I'm... I'm totally fine. Yeah, I'm not. I don't like the way that that was handled. I loved your read. You know that. I had some initial misgivings about the connection to your mother. But the film that I'm making is very different from the original. And, in fact, in some ways, it does not resemble it at all, which I will probably be taken to task for. The script is amazing. Thank you. You know, I just want you to feel strong, coming in like this. Things happen for a reason. I'm a big believer in that. So glad to have you on the show. Benjie? Hey! Victoria lapin, star! Channel. Are you ready for us now? No. Uh, we had 4:00 interview with you. No. Didn't genie tell you? No. Uh, well, could we just have 15 minutes? No. Okay, we've been waiting here for you. Why don't you talk to my co-star, Jim carrey junior? There he is. Hey! Mr. piece of shit vuh-by-nuh, wanna be on TV? Sure. Get your jail-bait ass over here. Hi, I'm Roy. No! No! No! No! Agatha: Hey, benjie. Fuck! You! Get out! Hey, it's okay. I'm here to make amends. How'd you get on the lot? I work for somebody who's doing a film here. Havana segrand? Are you gonna hurt me, Agatha? No. I'm not gonna hurt you. You're my little brother. You try and hurt me, I'll fucking kill you! Understood? Mmm-hmm. You hungry? Want a breakfast burrito? No, I can't stay long. Havana segrand, huh? Was that bullshit or were you serious? Mmm-hmm. Hmm. She's really good. We have the same agent. How'd that happen, you working for Havana segrand? Oh, it's through a friend. Carrie Fisher. You know, for a disfigured schizophrenic, you got the town pretty wired. They know you're here, Agatha. How? Dad, he's all fucking seeing and knowing, if you don't remember? Watch your step 'cause the old man's getting a restraining order against you or some such shit. I'd prefer if you didn't tell them I stopped by. I'm not a big fan of closure, so if you're looking for an epiphany that's gonna help you go on with your life then... I wrote to you, for years. To explain. Jeb: Benjie, it's Jeb berg! Takin' a nap, Jeb. There he is. Hey, that's all right. Listen, I got my nieces here from Connecticut and they... Universal studios. Put their asses on the tram, jebbo. You're so mean. I fuck 'em when I can. Want a cobalt? No. Sugar makes me crazy. Very funny. So, uh, mum and dad sent you to the snake pit? The courts did. You're lookin' pretty good. I was in sherman oaks on the burn ward. After my grafts, they sent me to Florida. Land of scarface. Tony Montana, I love it. Did you put that in? Mmm-hmm. That's Havana's mom. Did you start the fire? This is hard. No shit. Did you? But I didn't want anything to happen to you. Do you know about them, about who we are? Did they tell you? Pills? Vitamins. Probably something for sleep. So you gave me pills and then you set the house on fire. Why am I having trouble with the "I didn't want anything to happen to you" part? I was seeing things. Like what? Children. What did you do when you, uh, when you saw them? I would say, "by this ring, you are consecrated to me." I remember that's... That was the game we played. It always worked. As soon as I said it, they always went away. Okay. Uh, I think you have to go now. Benjie, there's this script. I can't explain, but you're part of this beautiful mythological script. Oh, my god. My long-lost psychotron sister is pitching me a movie. Agatha, leave. And take the DVD with you. You don't have to worry about me starting any more fires. They put my pilot light out. Work your program, Milton. Don't argue in the bedroom. Bedroom's for sleeping, making love, not for fighting. You need to talk, go to a coffee shop. Thank you. Thanks. See you Tuesday. Okay. Thanks. Yeah? Well, is she there now? Hello, Agatha. My books, you read any of them? Yes. Secrets kill. A classic. How did you find me? Please, no film noir questions. Did benjie... did benjie tell me you were here? How would he know that? Did you go see benjie? No. Bad idea, going to see benjie. Reckless. The question remains, why are you in la? I'm in recovery. I wanted to make amends. No one escapes the long arm of 12-step. Why didn't you ever come see me”? That's a victim question. That's an "I never promised you a Rose garden" question. You know why. I don't believe in rewarding homicidal behavior. I've changed. I wanted to tell you how... How sorry I am for what I did. I wanted to tell you and mother. I sent letters. Apologies accepted. You need money? No, I have a job. I'm working for Havana segrand. She asked if I knew you. Here. Here's $10,000. I want you to get on a plane. That would be a true amends. Our lives are rich and full. We made them from the ashes of what you left. Give Ms. segrand notice. Agatha: Father... Please. Don't ever think about seeing benjie again or Cristina, do you understand? You can't have actually believed I would let you come back and fuck up my world again. Take your skin cream, and your meds, and your hefty bag luggage, and set them at the door. And work your program. All right. We're done, benjie. I'll see you Friday. All right. Thanks, rusty. Hey! What are you doing in there? What the fuck are you doing in my pool? Who are you? Micah. He's a drowned boy. I don't wanna see you. I didn't do anything to you. His father thinks he could have done something to save him. That's what fathers always think. I'm not doing this. Go play with somebody else. I'm alive, asshole. I'm alive and I'm not crazy! I know a man who lives under the sword of damocles we call aids. "When my time comes,” he told me, "I'll be ready. "My bags are packed and at the door." I like that. I like that very much. There is a time, in our lives and in our therapies when our eyes stray to the bags at the door. Liberty. Say, "we have to stop.” We have to stop. "You're a patient here. I wanna help you." You're a patient here. I wanna help you. You don't think I set those fires, do you? Say, "I think that you didn't mean to. You just need help, that's all." I think you didn't mean to. You just need help, that's all. Don't you wanna help me? Leave my stockings. I have burns, my legs, my stomach and my back. Wow. Okay. "On my school notebook, on my desk and on the trees, "on the sand and in the snow, I write your name. "On all the flesh that says yes, on the forehead of my friends, "on every hand held out, I write your name." Host: Your mother, of course, was Clarice Taggart, the wonderful actress who died tragically in a fire in the mid-'70s. Havana: Christmas, '76. Host: You've spoken of your mother's addictions, and recently revealed, and very bravely, I must say, that you, yourself, were physically abused. Havana: And sexually, yes. Which is far more uncommon. Usually it's a male, the father, stepdad, what have you. Hmm. And I wanna talk about that, Havana. But, first, there is a question that I've been dying to ask. What is it like starring in a remake of a movie, stolen waters, as you are now, and essentially playing your mother? Scary. I mean, we all hear that we become our mothers, but this is a bit extreme. And she was even nominated. Havana: For an academy award, yes. Which I believe she should have won. But she did get the golden globe. I suppose I feel about as comfortable as l.. As I could. We're very lucky to have Damien javitz directing. Havana: Agatha! Host: Now, there is a man who's made... Havana: Agatha, can you come up here? Some strange films. Honored, yes, but strange, nonetheless. Don't be shy. I'm so backed up from the Vicodin. I need you to go back to whole foods and get me a laxative. I think it's called quiet moment. Oh. They should call it "unquiet moment". Um, and I'm gonna need you tonight. Maria can't work. One of her thousand kids has cholera, or whatever. Oh, um, but what... What do I do? Um, kitchen stuff, mostly. You know, easy. Refill drinks, maybe a little serving. You'll have fun. Lots of interesting people. It'll be good for you. Oh, fuck! I think I'm gonna need an enema. Oh, wait. Wait. I wanted to ask you something. Do you see men? Sometimes. Are you seeing someone now? You are! Just dating a little. What does he do? He's an actor. Oh, god. They're the worst. You have to fight 'em for the mirror in the mornings. Well, in my case, that doesn't apply. He writes, too. Oh, you know, you're very attractive. Don't run yourself down. Do you do it with him? Havana! You can tell me! How much do you do? Almost everything. Do you come? There you go. Is he a waiter? No, he... you, uh, he drives a limousine. You met him outside of Valentino's. Oh, yeah. He's cute. Man, limo drivers are wolves. Um, okay. Um, I need yogurt and cigarettes, and call the hot tub man because the water's cold. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, it stinks in here. Hey, suckerfish. Hey. You're out late for a school night. Two days off. Oh. Well, have a Shirley temple. Surely, you jest. Don't call me "Shirley." Oh, uh, benjie weiss, Gretchen voss. Hey, uh, I feel like getting into some shit tonight. You got any? What, the suits workin' you? Bustin' my expensive little hump one day at a time. Where's, uh, Kayla? Oh, fuck her. I did, after the teamsters sold her my poop. She got it for a song. Oh, you mean for a schiong. Oh, it's a long story. Long and coiled. What up with Sam? Well, let's find out, shall we? She dug you, man. She dug you, and you dissed her. I didn't diss her. Rhett, I know you're holding, man. I'm not gonna be the one to fuck up your sobriety, okay, benjie? Are you doing the new babysitter sequel? Yeah. They made me an offer my mother couldn't refuse. It made so much money. Yeah. I saw you in thrill kill. Cool. Well, we tried to have fun with horror. The critics got it, anyways. L, uh, got a little ghb, if you wanna get high. I think I love you. All right, Sam's on her way, Jose. Done deal. The Terminator. Cheers. Cheers. So I got this off of ebay. And, supposedly, it was used at columbine. Check it out. Hey! Hey! That's loaded, man, that's loaded. Then I'll empty it. Okay, don't fuck around. Benjie. Oh, my god, that is so sick. Oh, god, if America only knew. Gretchen: Finish the joke, Rhett. About the hillbilly. Oh, my god. You've only been telling it for an hour. Okay, so... okay. The hillbilly says to the yuppie... And, what exactly is a yuppie? Are you serious? Well, like, I know what it is. I just don't know what it stands for. Okay. The hillbilly says to the yuppie, right, he says, "I know a place where we can go," right, "where they got dancin', they got fightin', "they got drinkin' and they got fuckin'. Whoo!" Rhett, does this joke end in safe sex? Fuck safe sex! Let's bareback. Come on. All right, come on, give me that. Hey, I said, does this joke end in safe sex? Oh, well, I hope not. Then I'm gonna have to kill you. All right, come on. Benjie, this is getting old, all right? The yuppie says, "great. Who else is gonna be there?" Then the hillbilly says, "who else? Just me and you." You motherfucker! You idiot! Oh, god! Benjie: Holy shit! Rhett: This is so fucked! Fuck! Get out of here, benjie! Rhett, man, I'm sorry! You saw, I... I had all the bullets out. Rhett: You're fuckin' crazy. You killed my dog, asshole! You sick motherfucker, you killed my dog! Get out of here! May I come in? I'm not sure that's a good idea. I won't stay long, mom. I just wanted to make amends. I've seen this house in the magazines. In, uh, architectural digest and the profiles of father. Makes me feel exposed, but... Stafford likes things personalized to show the world how and where we live. Can I get you anything? Um, no, thank you. I supposedly quit. Actually, I thought you'd come here sooner. It... It's been seven years. It takes me that long to put on my make-up. Agatha, I... I didn't go to see you. I wouldn't have come to see me if I were you either. I was afraid because of what you did. You don't have to explain. I've dreamt so much of that old house. It was the first place I visited when I got back here. It's so strange that nobody's built on it. Well, we still own the property. Since before I can remember I've had the same dream. Benjie and me getting married there, in a big white tent. It didn't make any sense, and then I found out about you and dad. You were in Europe. I found the key to the lock box. All the pictures. We didn't know we were brother and sister. We'd been separated since we were kids. It was a freak thing. We met on campus in the desert. Agatha, we didn't know. We didn't know. What are you doing here? Stafford, it's all right. I told you to stay away from us. You didn't know. It was a freak thing. I found the diaries. Love is stronger than death. You crazy cunt! Stop it! Oh, daddy, don't! Cristina: Get off her! Okay. Okay. Gotta go! Gotta go! Don't take her! Gotta go! Daddy! Don't take her! Don't take her! Don't take her! Oh! Let me go! Agatha: Let me go! Agatha: Owl My ring. She took my wedding ring. My ring. Piss patrol, caught in the act. You know, you're chewing some major scenery out there. Roy: What do you mean? You know what I mean, vuh-by-nuh-head. Who's the star of the show? Huh? Can you tell me that, Roy? Uh, you are? Cammy: He's not your enemy. You... Love is stronger than death. You're a bad babysitter, Benjamin. Just diel just die! You're a very bad babysitter. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. He may be groggy from the medication. On. Oh, my baby. My baby, my baby, my baby. I'm so sorry, mom. Why? Benjie, why did you do it? He was just a little boy. I saw her again. Who, baby, Agatha? Did Agatha come to see you? The little girl, she tricked me. What little girl? From the hospital, the one that died that I keep seeing. Oh. Oh, my baby, my baby, my baby. Oh, my baby, my baby, my baby, my baby. We've got to get him home. I'd like to place him outside of California. We need Jonas to speak with the district attorney. He's only 13. We have to factor in the violence of the assault, Cristina. He didn't take a gun to a kid at school, Harriet. He hurt one boy. One boy! The state's become very tough on minors. They won't send him to jail? They won't send him to jail. The boy's gonna be all right. Oh, thank god. They've shut down production. I don't know if they're gonna recast. What? But it's such a small little part. What... Benjie! They're talking about recasting benjie! Oh, my god. It's over! Done! Now the whole world will know. The world will know we have done crimes. I hope you don't mind that I requested you. No, I'm glad. Oh, god. I feel shitty. I think I've got bronchitis. Kind of makes your voice sound sexy. Thank you. So how's the romance going? It's all right. It's pretty good. What's that all about for you? What do you mean? Um, you know, the burn thing. Is it creepy? To fuck her? No, not really. Does she take her gloves off? Do your friends think it's weird? Have your friends even met her? I'm kind of trying to... Trying to write a script about it. Ah! Research! Everything's research on some level. Mmm. Would you fuck me if I asked you to, for research? I don't know. How would we do it? Can you see me? Look at what I'm doing. How would we fuck? From behind? Uh... We could, if you want. I want. For a long time? Yeah. Am I better looking than her? Yeah. And my skin, do I have better skin? Yeah. And my holes? Are my holes better? You wanna fuck my holes? Yeah. I gotta go. Do me a favor, don't get out, just climb over. What happened to you? I took the bus. What's wrong with the car? It broke. What happened to you yesterday? I was sick. Yeah. I've been sick all week. I still manage to get up at 5:00 in the morning and work for 14 hours. What's wrong with you? I think I have the flu. You're acting really weird. And you're dirty. I'm sorry. It was too much trouble to just, like, text? I'm sorry. Stop saying that. Uh, you know, maybe this isn't working out. Maybe you need to just go back to Florida. You know, go back to Kansas, Dorothy. That's fine. But I wish you wouldn't just sit there like that because it's creeping me out. You smell. You smell. You hear me? Go home and take a bath. I'm sorry. Oh, my god! You bled! Don't you... Don't you use fucking Tampax? Are you psychotic? I'm sorry. I don't... I don't believe this. My... my crazy assistant just bled on my $12,000 couch! I don't want you in my life, you sick, fucking pig! I'm sorry. I'll pay for it. Go to the kitchen and get Perrier and bleach, and Google the best way to get rid of a stain! L... I pick you up off the street. I give you money so you can be late for work, and have your period on my furniture! Do... do you think that Carrie Fisher... Do... do you think Nicole Kidman and Halle Berry have scary little animals working for them? Scary, deformed... Hi, Agatha. Benjie. I went awol and told an orderly that if he let me slip out then I'd give him $10,000. Douchebag star fucker. How did you find me? You said you worked for her. And I've been up here before so... Where's Havana? She went to the canyon ranch. Damien gave her a couple of days off. I'm lost, Agatha. I couldn't go to Rhett's, and I can't go home. Benjie, you'll have to listen to me because there's nothing else. It's all ending now. Do you understand? This is Cristina's. You've got to get daddy's. Can you do that? Can you go to the house and get daddy's ring? We're gonna keep it quiet as long as we can. I don't want anything interfering with the book tour. Worst case, I go on Oprah again, fess up, do the whole Lance Armstrong thing. That'll build us a fresh money stream. So we kick it off Monday morning with gma and play it as it lays. Ciao. Cristina? Cristina? Cristina? Cristina! Cristina! Dad? Dad? I haven't taken this many before. That was so brave of you, to go back there. I just slipped it off his finger. It was like he wanted me to have it. We should start. I had 13 summers. Not so bad. Hey, not so bad. Agatha: By this ring... Benjie: By this ring... Agatha: You are consecrated to me... I am consecrated to you... As my husband... As your husband. Benjie: By this ring... Agatha: By this ring... Benjie: You are consecrated to me as my wife. I am consecrated to you as your wife. Make me as a seal upon your heart. You may kiss the bride. "On absence without desire. "On naked solitude. "On the stairs of death, I write your name. "On health that has returned. "On danger that has left.
