However, with the permission of this house. I would like to postpone consideration of all these measures. Instead. I would like to take up at this time, The Brubaker case. ( reporter ) Uh General. Can we get some kind of statement on the Brubaker case? No! At this stage it would be prejudicial to law and justice for me to comment in any way. Except to say it's an outrage! An outrage! Certainly it is one of the dark chapters in the history of human conduct. We must ask ourselves certain questions about this man, Gus Brubaker. For the answers, we'll have to go back to last year, to August of 1953. Who was Gus? What was Gus? And for that mayyer. Why was Gus? Gus! Gus! Yeah. Yeah? That fella you let sign a tab last thursday. He got the booze. You got the hangover. Let me see that. Um hum Seemed like such a nice man. Sam: Hi Mrs. Bribaker. Mrs Brubaker: Hi Sam. Oh, hi honey. You look so pretty Well, thank you. I'll be with you in a minute as soon as I balance these receipts. Alright. I guess we'll have to write this one off. Write what off? The tab. I let somebaody beat me out of forty dollars. Oh, why? Wife was gonna have a baby. This is for whisky. Whats that got to do with having a baby? He said he needed strength. OH, Gus. Alright. So I am a schnook. Just let it go at that. Eh? Whats that? A mommy thing? No, a schnook is what I am. A fella who does a favor only it backfires. Not once or twice. Every single time. A schnook, is when you answer the door, and some kid wants to mow the lawn for fifty cents. The lawn doesn't need mowin. But you let him do it anyway. That night they arrest you for breaking the child labor law. That's me. Registered schnook. I agrees You're a schnook. Thanks. I mean about the insurance. The GI insurance. The deadline is monday. Marge, we have been through this ten times. I don't any more insurance. This is different. You were in the Air Force. You're entitled to GI insurance. Marge, I don't ever want to hear the word GI again. I never want to see another uniform again. Any uniform. I look at a boyscout and I feel like ducking into a sewer like it was a foxhole and pulling the cover over me. Suit yourself, but you have responsibilities. You have this place and you've got a lot of money tied up in that broken down farm house. Please, Marge. Hotel. Hotel. And those hot srings, it means money in the bank. Just the same, you have a wife and children. Insurance is a good thing. It provides for the future. No it doesn't. It provides for the lack of it. Look, Marge. Seven years ago, the Air force and I got what's called a friendly divorce. Nothing sentimental. We just shook hands and promised not to write. I'd like to leave it that way. Please. No more talk about GI insurance Mmmm? We'll drop it. If that's the way you feel about it. Good. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure who brough the subject up. Come on. Lets go home. But ah-- Aba -- Eee mon ee Yee yee Rrroooowwwrrr Where did you get that? Discoes. They were all out of gingham so.. I guess I will have to make this do. { laughs } Well, I -- I guess we better get some shuteye. Oh, Your hair looks just fine honey. Really. I-- I-- I think you better Better get some sleep. I wonder how I'd look in a pony tail. Oh, Marge. This is ridiculous. Now, everybody knows the best time to try a pony tail is in the morning. Now, come on. Let's get a little sleep huh. You just don't understand gus. A woman has got to look her best. It's her only insurance. oh, no. Oh no, no no, not that GI insurance again. Oh, I didn't mean it that way, Gus, but, but it is good insurance. It's almost free. They practically give it to you. Marge, everything I ever got from the Air Force, they practically gave. In basic training when I got the measels up at Camp Devon. And the time the lieutenant ran over my foot with a tractor. It was free. Absolutely no charge. And overseas riding back and forth on that B17. Didn't cost me one penny. Neither did that German flack. And the two years I spent in the prison camp. didn't cost me One -- Thin -- Dime. Everything. Absolutely everything I ever got from the Air Force they practically gave. It's getting late. let's catch up on some shut eye. You're reading a book! At this hour? Marge, it's eleven o'clock. Five after. Well, it must be a very interesting book. What is it? Elemetary shorthand. Shorthand? In the middle of the night? Well, it's very interesting. Besides, it's a good thing to know. In case. All right. I give up. You win. I'll go down first thing in the morning. Go where? The GI insurance. Hey look. Would you throw away that book and come to bed if I promise to get the GI insurance. Well, if you feel you want more insurance but -- I don't know where you got the idea I'm the least bit interested. Of Course. Schnook. { snapping fingers } You. You fill out the D1 health report? Name? Gus Brubaker. When'd you enter the service? Dec, 1941. When'd you get out? April, 1945. Final rank? Private. I was about to make colonel but the war ended. Serial number? Which one? I got two. Everybodies got one serial number.. Eisenhower's got one. McArthur's got one. I got two. You got two. Look, there were over 13 million men in the service. I know what you are going to say, but I still got two serial numbers It's a long story You see, in 1941, they gave me a serial number. and put me on a B17 And then the Germans shot me down, and I spent the rest of the war in a prison camp. In 1945 they sent me back to Westover Field for release. But they got mad at me for ruining their paperwork. How? Well, they said I was supposed to be dead. So, you got two serial numbers. Let's have the last one. A F dash A F dash Length of service? 3 years and 4 months. No, no, no. You've got to be consistant. Now, according to this number, how long where you in? But I told you. They gave it to me and the next day I was released. Length of service. One day. Decorations... None. Specialist in? I was a tail gunner. Aww. Will ya try to get it straight? Everything on this form has to be consistant. Now, how can you be a tail gunner if you're in the army only one day? You, you sure about this? I don't wanna make any mistake. Believe me. They will toss this right out if things don't match. You can't be a specialist in the Army with only one day's training. Unless you're a General or somebody like that. Well. Whatever you say. Look. There's no point is wasting anymore of your time. You sign these. I got all the dope. I'll put it all down, and keep it consistant. Eisenhower has one. McArthor has one. You got two. Two. { Announcer on TV givng commentary on the baseball game.} { Bar crowd has several indistinct conversations. } ( Phone rings } Hello. Oh, Sure. Just a minute Mrs Brubaker. Gus! Gus. Your wife's on the phone. Hi ya hun. Gus. I'm watchin the ballgame. There's a letter here from wasington. Oh, that would be the insurance. Just leave it on the desk.

Subject. Immediate call up. { Trumpet plays } Gus? Gus, is anything wrong? No. Just routine. I've been drafted. Marge, I've been drafted! It's a mistake. Just call up and tell them you're busy at the resurant. I already told them enough on that insurance form. Oh dear. Oh I'm sorry darling. I know it's mostly my fault. Please, don't feel that way, Marge. Because it's not true. { Shouting } It's all your fault! Coffee, Gus? No. Spam. { Bugle plays } We're gonna miss you, Gus. We're gonna miss you terribly. Bye Daddy. Bye Daddy. It'll only be for a week. I'll see the Colonel. He can get out a teletype and clear it up by Saturday. I'll check at the resturant during the week.

Depends on your orders. She'll drive to the Waco gate. Waco? Where's that? Is that where the highway turned over there? It's in Waco, Texas. You're in radar group 5. They shove off in 2 hours. Where's the Colonel? Whoever's got charge of me. In Texas. Where else? You see, theres been a mistake I don't even belong in uniform. You too? Which gate? You can't miss it honey.

I heard the name before. It's uhh Mike! Where's Shima? Up in Oregon I think It's gotta be overseas. He's got a voucher for 7 thousand miles. I don't think there is any such place. You sure it's not a misprint? Just sit tight pal. We'll try and find it. { Phone rings } Hey, Brubaker. Phone. Hello Yeah Put her on. High Darling {Faint voice } Gus. How are you? Fine. How are you? Well, I finally got my orders. Oh, Gus, you're coming home. They're letting you out. The only thing they're letting me out of is the country. { Faint voice } Where to? It's a place called Shima. Where's that? Nobody's sure. but their gonna get in touch with the Pentagon to see if they know. Don't worry darling. As soon as I get a permanent staion I'll be able to get a release. About the payment on the hotel. I'll stall the bank for a while. I'll tell them you are on some secret government mission. That's no lie. Take care of yourself, darling. { faint voice } I love you very much. And I love you too. hey, Hey. Brubaker. Come 'ere. We got some dope on Shima.

Yeah, you try to find it. Thanks, fellas. { Boat horn blowing } You wouldn't happen to know where the radar station is? Up toward the top. Hey, Don, here give him these. Thanks. Toward the top? How do ya get up there? I don't know. I guess the best way is you have to be born up there. What are we doing with an island way out here? I think we lost a treaty and had to take it. At least the people in town act that way. They don't like anybody in uniform. Well. it doesn't make any difference to me anyway. I'm not gonna be here long. I'm due for a discharge. That why they sent you all the way from New Jersey? On the starboard beam! We got a another one, Chief. We got a another one. Grab the line and the rescue gear! Belay that. Belay that, Chief. It's only a porpoise. Belay it. We picked up a soldier out here last month. 10 miles off shore. What was he doing way out here. Said he was swimming to San Francisco. He might have made it too. He had a nice stroke Well, I guess there's a screwball in every outfit. Yeah Only this case didn't leave too good an impression. The guy we picked up was the moral officer. { Boat horn blows } { Background kiyoto music playing } { Indistinct murmuring in background. } So long Brubaker. Good luck. Thanks, Chief.

Did he get it in Plymouth? I'm not sure. I think so. In a little pub. Did he have a fight with 5 Canadian marines? He said 7. Oh, it couldn't be. It just couldn't be.

People in town didn't move it. Maybe they never would have. But we cinched it. We showed up on the island. Two weeks later they turned it into a shrine. Planted some flowers. put a canopy over it. Just to show how they felt about us. I don't understand. Honestly I don't Hasn't anyone ever told you aboult soldiers, Gus?

Sayonara Sayonara. { Beer cans exploding } It's in the.. book. Just find the book and I'll prove it. Captain. There ought to be at least one copy of Air force regulations on this island. Certainly think so. { Arrow thunks into can } { Arrow thunks into can } Wait a minute. I think this is it. Yeah. Here. Crazy huh? There. { Arrow thunks into can } Hey, he's right Captain It says Air Force personel are permitted to do outside work during off duty hours. That's just for parkin cars and makin book. Not for a crazy scheme like this. { Arrow thunks into can } He's got a point, Gus. You can't just spot an open field and decide to build a hotel. It's alright for a guy like Hilton. He's got nothin else to do. Believe me, you're wrong. That hot springs out there it's the perfect place for a hotel. Doc, get the white jacket. Boy-san's had it. We can build it from the ground up. We got the tools. We got the material. We got the men. The Shima Springs hotel Garden spot of the Orient. I suppose it could be done. Yeah. We form a coperation. Every man on the island is a stock holder. With a few hunderd bucks. What is it gonna be? One room and a lobby? We can get most of the stuff at 10 cents on the dollar. Just take a look around. Now that the Korean thing is over with, We got stacks of lumber lieing on the beach. We got cement and steel fittings stockpiled all over the island. Supply will be glad to get rid of it. It's cheaper than shipping it home. There's only one thing to do. Let's test it out on a good reliable man. { yelling } Weiscoff! Yeah Cap? Hey, Sam. Check me out on this. How would you like to build a hotel, right in the middle of shima. A hotel. Well, Cap. It's one of those ideas that sounds crazy when you first hear about it. Then the more you think about it, the crazier it gets. There' nothing crazy about making money. Cap, you got people over here shooting off arrows. Weaving baskets. Anythings to keeping them frpm going off their rockers. Well, there is only one way to cure about it. And that's making money. I agree. Money is very therapeutic. Yeah, but to make money you gotta have customers. We got thousands of them. Flying overhead every day. Military personel going on leave. Headed for rest and recreation. I tell ya, Captain, it's bound to work. I'll tell ya why. When a man has been stuck in the mud and the rain for months. and he gets a few days off. What's the very first thing he wants? Well I -- In sams case you better ask what the second thing is. Please. It's a decent room. With clean sheets and pillow cases. We'll give it to em. and it's not just R and R. It's all the government people on the mainland. soldiers, Marines Military government. And don't forget the women's units. The WACs. The WAFs. Hey. That's a great idea Captain We start off on a small scale. A hotel for only WAFs and WACs. Until we get the hang of things. Huh? Gus, I think this idea will work because it doesn't make a bit of sense. You really mean it, Doc. Take my word for it. This idea is not logical enough to be a failure. It's just what I was gonna say. Okay. We build it. Bombs away. { everone cheering } Hey, Gus. Hey, Guuussss! Yeah? What is it? We're ready. What would you like leveled? The airstrip first. We'll need more runway. Okay you gophers. Let's dig. { men cheering } The airstrip, James. Johnathon! Johnathon. Coming. Your card index says you've done some building. That's right. 5 years general contracting. You think you can handle this? I've done 3 mental hospitals. Most resort hotels have the same basic design. Well the first thing, better hop out and look at that meadow. And then the hot springs. Right. I filled the cooperation papers, Gus. You better sign these. Why me? Somebody's got to have the power of attorney. We better open up a bank account. Tokyo maybe. I'd bank it right down here in the village. A binky little joint like that? You don't have to be big to be honest. That's not the point, Doc. They don't like us. Well, you better see that they do. You're building a big hotel here. Where ya gonna put it? On hydrolic jacks in thin air? Except for the airport stuff, every foot of this island belongs to those people in the village. You mean we're gonna have to pay rent to them? No. I mean we're gonna have to try and pay rent to them. Lawyer: And that won't be easy. Imagine a bank turning down money? A little pip squeak joint like that. A lesson to every working girl. You don't have to be rich to say no. Would you tell the mayor, we would like to see him. We're from the base here. Master says, wishing to be truthful, he is not home. Could we make a date to see him? No. No. No. He says in future he is not desiring to be home also. Well. That's that. Please.

Well then maybe you'd be good enough to take me to your commanding officer. You got em. Right here. Captain Charlie Stark. Oh, I'm sorry Captain. I didn't recognize you in battle dress.

They're a great bunch of boys. You'll love em. Oh, I'm sure Captain. But not at first sight. Tell me, Captain Has Washington seen a photograph of this command? I don't think so. Too bad.

They're kinda choosey about passing out water. That's right. Doc, there must be something we can do. This is an awful way to treat science. I.. I.. I think you can ace your way in.

And I think I feel the same way,Chuck. Except marriage is out. What's the out about? You're a sky tramp. No, but that's all over. I'm gonna stick in this Air Force. Well, stick is the right word. Why do you think you're still a Captain? I guess I just can't get any generals to die. Or it's because you're irresponsable and they know it. Like that time in Washington. They want Officers, not jockies. Once in my life I buzz a little building, How was I to know it was the Supreme Court? Well, if you had any sense, you'd stop buzzing around in airplanes. Take a desk job. I don't think I could learn to fly a desk. Oh, yes you could Chuck. That's the funny part. If you tried. I know you could. Will you? Yeah. Yeah. He wants to show his granchilderen around the place. Well, fine. Let him. Guys. I'll take these bags for you, sir. Thank you. Now, now, now Dodge, keep it simple. It's important they look sweet.

Gus, The fells think you;re crazy. You didn't have to say you own the joint. All he could do. You're up on two charges. Stealing government property and running a hotel. Running a hotel. There's nothing wrong with that. That's not exactley what it says. As near as I can make out, they say your a brothel keeper. Marge is gonna love that. Well, that stinkin' Colonel kept his word. I've been ordered to Kyushu. That's a bad break. Gus needs you. What makes you think I'm going? Figure a way out to beat it. I'm gonna be too sick to travel I have a terrible illness comin' on. Oh? What illness? That's where you come in, Doc.You gotta dig me up a disease. Like a plague or uh, Maybe some snake bit me when I wasn't lookin'. I'm afraid Doc is gonna be a little busy. This says I can choose my own lawer. I can get anyone I won't to defend me. Well, there is one thing we can do. We'll get you the best. Well. I'm glad you think that way, Doc. Cause I picked you. Court will come to order. Trial counsel will read preliminaries. This general court martial is convened by special orders number A 2 1 5 headquartes 5th Air force. The prosecution is ready to proceed in the case of the United States against accused Bribaker, Gustave, serial number A F 1 4 1 0 9 6 6 0 Grade, Airman 3rd Class United staes Air force It's a mistake, Doc. It shoild be.. Shhh Trial counselor will call to the stand, Lt Malcom Dressler. You swear that the evidence you shall give in the case now in hearing shall be the thrith, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God. I do. Alright. Please be seated. You are a 1st Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and how assigned? I'm procurement officer for the 10th Area Suplly Depot. Will you be kind enough to give the listed value of the following items? First, parachutes. Well, they are purchased by the Air force at the unit price of $400. I object. That's the price of new parachutes. The accused used only old and damaged parachutes. Sir, if the defense counsel will look at page 3 6 1 of the manual for courts martial he will find out, and I quote .. Misappropriated items of goverment issue are deemed to have values the eqivalent of the prices listed in goverment publications. or by it's replacement cost whichever is lesser. Objection overruled. Now, the price on sacks of cement? Lt, I wonder if you could summarize. Yes, sir. 640 items in 19 catagories That comes to 485 thousand 327 dollars and 19 cents. Sir, this whole case is based on the fact that the accused acted without proper authority. I'd like to intruduce contrary evidence. A signed affidavit from Capt Charles Stark. Objectionn. This evidence is inadmissible. A proper deposition must give opposing counsel a chance to cross examine. I was given no such opportunity. This is a staement by a commanding officer. It bears on the conduct of a subordinate. Isn't taht important in a Court martial? I'm afraid I'll have to rule the objection sustained. So, what's the whole point of legal testimony? Does it exist to reveal truth or obscure it. Which is more important? Rules of evidence says.. I don't know anything about rules of evidence. But I know what's important. I know that if a man has a headache and a compound fracture, you put on a tourniquet before you give him an asprin. I'll repeat the objection is sustained. However, I'd like to agree Doctor. If the medical profession were operated by trained legal minds, The human race would have died out shortly after Adam appeared. Prosecution, proceed. I request the witness be excused. You're excused Lt. Courts adjurned for the day. Tomorrow 10 o'clock. The first day of the trial was all prosecution. Make no mistake about that. 10 witnesses and a damaging bill of particulars. The defense made very little headway. They seemed frustrated, bewildered by court room tactics. The truth of the matter is, The desfense attorney is just not enough of a street fighter. And so, the first day of this trial has come to an end. A trial that is being held in the hotel Shima. { faint news reporter } On a barren patch of land ... Doc! It was terrible, the way they through out Chucks satement. They could have thrown him out. If he had been here. You're thrying to be subtle, Doc. You're trying to say it's all my fault. That I talked him into leaving. Then I won't be subtle. I'll say it right out. It was a terrible thing to do to a man. Oh please, Doc. You know I wouldn't hurt Gus. I wouldn't hurt him for anything in the world. You didn't hurt Gus. But, you ruined Charlie Stark. Hello, Doc. How many women are there in the world, Doc? Oh, half a billion. Give or take a few. Listen to the one I picked. It's from Marge. My darling Gus. The Daily News this morning called you the Vice King of the Orient. The whole thing is silly. I told the reporters that you are too shy to start such a personal organization. We all miss you. And I know you will do well in the trial. All my love. Marge. P.S. I hope you can get me some curtains like you gave the Colonel. Love. Love. Love. What curtains? Oh, Colonel Hollinsworth. His wife wanted some of that drapery material. You sent it? Yeah. We put in that second shipment of pink crab. Oh? Tell me more. What's the matter with you? Just keep talking. I might turn into a street fighter yet? Waa? The accused, Airman Brubaker. What does he pay you? Do not pay. Giving father 50 dollar. This making right to ownership. So. Airman Brubaker owns you? You are subject to his orders. Objection! This makes five witnesses and the same set of questions. I submit the issue it is not how these girls were hired but why. Sir, this testomoney is designed to establish that these girls have been completly under the control of the accused. That they are obligated to do his bidding. But, sir Obejection over ruled. proceed. No further questions of this witness. You're excused, miss. Call to the stand Miss Ume Tonaka. Papa-San Pity you don't have some rude friends. Oh. Please, that way. Uh. Miss Tonaka. Miss Tonaka. Do you swear what you are going to tell this court, Will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Hai Please, be seated. Tell me. You are one of the girls owned by Mr Brubaker? Hai Do you enjoy this arrangement? Hai Why? Because ... Having Heart felt love for Papa-San. You mean you are in love with the accused? Meaning to say .. having very deep like for Papa-San. That's not what she means. I submit to the court, this is a simple girl speaking a strang language. She doesn't mean love the way we do. She's using the word in the biblical sense. Miss Tonaka. Have you ever read the bible? Not really love. Having love. Is .. woderous outpour. Like .. Spring rain. Loving him. Is it fair to say you would do anything for him? Hai Just where is this leading? To the next witness, Miss Kieko Shakata. Please. Gotta admit she's loyal. She's gonna bow you right into Leavenworth. Miss Shakata Do you swear what you are going to tell this court, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Hai Please be seated. Kieko, you belong to Pap-San and you work at the hotel? Hai At anytime, during your employment did any of the guest try to get intimate with you> Uh, Did any of the guests try to uh, .. kiss you? Hai Did they try to embrace you? Hai And did they offer you tips? Hai Your honor, this is misleading. You know soldiers. There' always a few if they get to drinking. They'd make a pass at Whistler's mother. { laughter } That doesn't mean this girl responded. Kieko, when they tried to kiss them. What did you do? Kiss them back. And Kieko, when they tried to embrace you, what happened? I'm being Johnny on the spot. { laughter } Fine thing, Keiko. Maybe you kiss somebody once. A person was nice to you, so you kissed him once. Not being once. The how many times? Being maimum various times. { laughter and banging gavel } Hai I am allowed to gets excused? You're excused, yes. Papa-San Out of 54 girls, he's gotta find the only one with a case of hot kimono. Papa-San? People say .. I doing you a granded disadvantage. I being schnook. We both are Ume. You've got the eastern franchise. I will make up. I will doing good turn to make up for this offend. Don't woory Ume, you were fine. But that Kieko girl. Kissing and necking. We having great shame for Keiko. Why did she do all those things? Just tell me why. She said, it giving more fun than baseball. Syonara Baseball. Baseball? The prosecution has repeatedly charged that the accused action has damaged moral. There whole case hangs on it. I say the contrary. The moral on this airbase has been raised. The moral of this village has been raised. Capt Starke's statement supports the view. Capt Stark's statement is not admisible in this court. { jet noise drowns out courtroom } Colonel, this is your command. Is there anyway you can keep those T33's quiet? I'm sorry, sir, but we don;t have any jets based here. { Jet noise } Well, what's that? A cricket? Go out and see what's the matter. Go ahead, Doctor. Alright, Capt Stark's statement is out. Let's consider the moral of this village. Our State Department is pouring millions of dollars into every neutral country in the world. To gain friendship of as many people as possible. In many cases, it's been a failure. Why? Because it's been said we can't buy friendship. I disagree. We Can buy the friendship of people. Not by giving them money but, by giving the dignity. By giving them a chance to prosper with some measure of pride. Look around you. Study this village. That miracle has happened. It didn't happen in China. It didn't happen in Middle Europe. But here in one little corner of the world, we've made some friends. I must object to this. This is straight electioneering and covers up the facts. If the people are so friendly, what's that shrine doing out there? And why do the flaunt it in our faces? That's something I can't explain. But I do know the people have worked hard. The've worked hard to help the accused steal 400 thousand dollars from the government. That's a false figure. Take the parachutes alone. I object. And I object to you, Major. Have you ever been a flyer? Why, uh, no sir. Well, I have. Those parachutes were damaged. And if a parachute can't save a man's life, it's not worth 40 cents. It's completely worthless. Thank you, sir. It's that way with every single item on that list. This waste basket. It's listed as 40 dollars stolen. from the government. This is what was stolen from the government. A 5 gallon can. It's the same as the ashtrays. Would you like a fancy ashtray? That's how the ashtray looked at first. Ordinary clay. Untill the people down in the village went to work. These chairs you're sitting in, gentleman. There listed at 70 dollars. Do you know what they're from? From old B25's and worth about 30 cents a pound. Providing you like scrap metal. { jet engine roaring overhead } Hey! Sam! Tell Doc I'm here. Right Cap. Somebody get me a match. This cigar's out. Hey, Doc! Boogies at 12 o'clock high. Colonel, is that man up there in the same Air Force we are? He is supposed to be on Kyushu. Arrest him! You can't arrest him Colonel. Your authority covers the island of Shima. He's not on the island yet. { gavel bangs } Sir? May I consult with the Colonel for a moment? Yes, sir. There's nothing to talk about. That's right Colonel. There's very little to talk about. Except thos King crabs. Eeeh. Uhh. Crabs? Yes, sir. Nearly 200 of them. Shipped to you on official bills of lading. Plus the drapes. They must look very nice in the breakfast room. What are you trying to do? Blackmail me? Blackmail? No, sir. As a doctor of medicine. I'm advising you on a matter of health All right. Sir. The Colonel says he's anxious to have Capt Stark testify. { loud cheering } Well, good morning, gentlemen. Now, if somebody will just hand me a Bible, Ill swear in. Did you know about this? Of course we knew about it. It wasn't just Brubaker. It was everyone. I object. Over ruled. You've made your point. { faint chanting } There's only one thing I don't understand. What's a meatball? { chanting continues } { gavel bangs | Colonel. There's some kind of noise or singing. Has someone in this hotel got a record player going? No, sir. I think the is somebody mumbling. Out there. { group chanting } { gavel bangs } Alright, let's get on. Now as to the moral factor. Look, I can talk better if you keep quiet. In here I have a list of 100 men. For the last 3 months, not a single reqest for transfer No diabilities, no hardship. Now check this against the whole Far East command. The highest moral rating is right here on Shima. { chanting continues, gavel bangs } Colonel. That isn't mumbling. It's singing. Captain. Go tell them to stop singing. { man singing } { singing continues, court mummers } { loud group singing } { gavel bangs } Colonel, let's get some order in here. Go tell them to stop that singing! And tell them to stop burning that airplane! It's their plane. Can't make em stop now sir. That's moral. Well. I object. I object to this outragious show! Sir. The defense rests. Singing continues Great Scott. Another witness! { gavel bangs } Courts adjourned! Courts adjourned! How bout a ride Baby. I don't ride with people who hang from flag poles. Ah, come on. Don't be a meatball. And I don't ride with people who say, meatball. If you don't mind. I'd like to ask a question. Wait a minute. I do mind. I'm gonna ask all the questions around here and I'm gonna give all the answers. We're gonna have some equality from now on. You're hopeless, Chuck. Yeah, and let's keep it that way. I'm not gonna switch and be somebodty else just to please you. I didn't ask for that. You asked for plenty. Boy, I must have been crazy to walk out on Gus. I was crazy to do all of those things. Savin money, given up my planes, readin books. That's not the point. There were a few things wrong with you. Theres a lot of things wrong with me. And one of thm is that I'm in love with ya. Was even crazy enough to want to marry ya. I can see it now. It would be a beautiful ceremony in a vine covered church with you parachuting through the roof. Look, don't worry how I get there. You just run your end of the store. All you have do is sit around lookin pretty, rack up a few babies and keep some cold cans of beers in the ice box. Am I allowed to breath? Yeah, but check it out with me first, huh? Those are the new rules baby. Wanna play house? Get in the jeep. If ya don't. Keep walkin. { romantic music plays } Well, Captin. Looks like we're all present. Mmm hmm { gavel bangs } As you can see, some changes have been made. There'll be no pandemonium here today. This final session will be sane, sober and orderly. The president will now read the findings of the court. Airman Brubaker. Of the 2nd charge, alleging a morals violation. This court martial finds you not guilty. For the first charge. Dealing with misappropriation of government property. This court matial finds you Guilty The court will now here the personnel data concerning the accused. Accused, Brubaker, Gustave.. Seriel number A F 1 4 1 9 6 6 0 Grade, Airman, 3rd class, United States Air Force. What? You sure? [ gavel bangs } Sir. would you .. please read that again? About the serial number. Serial number. A F 1 4 1 0 9 6 6 0 Thank you, sir. At this time I'd formaly would like to petition the court to declare a mistrial. Uh, on what grounds? The simple grounds, you've tried the wrong man. Heaven help us. You mean this .. this isn't Gus Brubaker? Yes and no, sir. You see, I'm Brubaker .. 3 5 9 8 3 7 4 9 Instead of Brubaker A F 1 4 1 0 9 6 6 0 It's a long story. sir. Well, shorten it and shorten it fast. Where's this other Brubaker? He's daed. It's official and marked in the records. Well, this dead one, Is that our Brubaker? Major, explain this and explain it fast. Well, I.. I tele-typed Wasington, uh they sent back a serial number for a man named Gus Brubaker. I'm afraid that's it. sir. You got the tail gunner. Now, let me get this straight. You mean there are two Gus Brubakers? And you're both of em? That's right, sir. only you tried the dead one. { murmmering about 2 Brubakers } { gavel taps } { gavel slams } Sit down! Now. We are going to take exactly 5 minutes. And we are going to throughly straighten this thing out. Uh, yes sir? Yes, sir. Yeah. Yeah. I understand, sir. Well, I'll try to summarize our progress. %th Air Force passed the matter onto FEFF. FEFF passed it on to the Judge Advocates general's Office. The Judge Advocates General's Office passed it back to FEFF. FEFF passed it back to 5th Air Force and 5th Air Force passed it back to us. They uh. They uh, said to take the bull by the horns. Sir, I'd like to make a suggestion. Instead of a mistrial, wouldn't it be easier to return a finding of not guilty. Well, only one things stands in the way. Government property was taken/ It's a case of how you look at it. I say it wasn't taken. It was put to use. I don't mean just lumber. After a war, there are a lot of things left laying on the beach. Men, for instance. They're ledt on little islands in the backwash in some forgotten latitude. They're told to do a job. Some vague but, necessary chore. They do it and sometimes waste in the process. But not on Shima, gentlemen. For a few crazy, goofey, minutes, the men were alive again. Gus Brubaker picked up more than lumber off the beach. He picked up men. Can't we let him go? Before he turns into a national hero? Except for the hotel. We can't let him keep it. May it please the court. Would it be possible to turn the hotel to the people of this village? { mumbling } Please bring in the accused. { gavel bangs | Airman Brubaker. After further deliberation in closed session this court martial finds you not guilty of all charges and specifacations. The court is adjourned. { gavel bangs } Doctor Farrinton. I'd like to thank you for your curtesy and good sense. Brubaker! Yes. sir. I'd like to commend you for what you have done for our Air Force. I can think of only one other man who has matched your record. I refer of course, to Baron von Richthofen. The keys. { trumpts blaring } { trumpets blaring and crowd clapping } { jet noise overhead } Hello, Ume. Please to give doll. Now you having luck. Two time best, always. { boat horn } Syonara, Ume. { horn blaring } { inaudible } So long... Papa-San. Hold it. New man going ashore. Moral Off
