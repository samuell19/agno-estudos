So what's the deal with you and Terry? With me? It's strictly business. Well that's good, 'cause I ain't gonna be around long. Yeah, I could've guessed that. Terry's going down, Charlotte, and you don't have to fucking go down with him. I've seen the way he fucking looks at you, talks to you, touches you, and I'm telling you now, the first fucking chance he gets, he's gonna put a bit blade in your fucking back. What you laughing at?

You're gonna go to graft and you're gonna get that fucking key no matter what you do, and I'll take care of Terry. What do you mean "Take care of Terry"? What do you fucking think? Come in Pat. Close the door. Take a seat. So, how's Marbella treating you? No, I ain't fucking come here for small talk. What do you want? Okay, straight to business. None of your fucking business knows wants. 'Cause I'm hoping you're gonna jump on the first flight back to Essex. And why would I do what you fucking want? 'Cause you're gonna have no choice. Now, I'm gonna need you to pay very very close attention to what I'm about to show you. I'm very excited about this. This is fucking gold. It's incredible isn't it. You know, the clarity that you can get on people's faces now it's just, its amazing. Now this is my favourite part. Watch this, wait for it, wait for it. Oh ho ho, my god, you really are a vicious bastard, aren't you, Pat. Here, catch. You see, I've got this coza, he works for me. And he managed to snag that before anyone's had a chance to see it. How many copies have you got of this? Just the one. So where's the original? Locked up, in there. Well let me tell you something, you flash cunt. I ain't fucking going nowhere until you get that fucking tape out the safe. So get your fucking... - No no, no Pat. We both know that's not how this plays out. Now I'm guessing you didn't tell anyone you were coming here today, am I right? Yeah, I thought so. So, it would be very easy just to make you disappear and I bet no one would give a fuck that you're gone. So this is the last warning you're gonna get from me mate. Go home, pack your shit, and get the fuck out of Marbella tonight. Now, let's just fucking take a breath here. I got a little bit more business to take care of in the next couple of days.

Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel, Nigel - It's showtime. What a magnificent reception for the champion. Like Tyson of haggler, Ben says he's never dumped anybody. Pat, here Pat, come here, come here, have a look. Have a look, there's Tony. I've never seen him look so fucking happy. - Go on Tone! - Go on Tone! At 31 he knows there aren't many nights like this ahead of him if he loses. He's met the best and come through. He's promised to drop everybody tonight. A terrific reception for Nigel Benn. Come on Nige. Once again, here the ref in charge Darrow, now to give instructions. And off they go, unbelievable atmosphere here in Docklands. - Come on Nigel. - Remember the G-Man McClellan has promised to finish this in the first round. A lot of money on the fight going short as well. Benn for champion. And they're going at it, toe to toe from the start. No scouting measures here at all. A lot of leather being thrown very early on in this fight. Benn coming along the ropes here. He's trapped on the ropes and McClellan and he's a late, he's gone through the ropes! There a play for the wait here in the very first seconds. Right through the ropes, crazy at the ringside. Can Nigel Benn get back in time? He's been pushed back in by a couple of commentators. He's in, he's okay. - Come on, Nigel. He's going to be allowed to continue but for how long? Can he survive this opening round? Keep your arms up Nigel! McClellan, ready to finish this, right here and now. Go on Nigel! Hello? I can't hear ya, hold on a minute, hold on. Pat, it's Ken. Listen, mate, we've got a big fucking problem. Yeah well spit it out, I've got a fucking fight to watch. Some kid's been taken to the hospital. So what? He took one of them pills, one of them new ones from Spain. - And what happened? - I don't know mate. He's been rushed to hospital. It's not looking good. I've bill all over the gaff, asking questions, asking for you by name. Now you listen to me carefully, you flush everything you've got. You go through everyone else's pockets and you do the fucking same. If anyone breathes a fucking word to the old bill they're dead. Yeah, no worries, Pat. That's it, will power and they're fighting hard. The left arch is swerved Nigel there. He's got McClellan in trouble as well. We've got to go now. - What, what? - Now! He's surely gonna have to go down here. He has gone down, McClellan, in the corner. The referee urges him to get up. He should be counting him. McClellan in a dark place now. Fucking hell Pat, I can't believe we've got to get rid of all those pills. Listen, if we're connected to those pills and that kid dies, we're going down for fucking murder. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? - No, well of course not. It's just, just look how many there is mate. It's sacrilegious look, think of all the fucking waste. Them pills are fucking poison. Sooner we get rid of them the better. - Yes, yes yes! - Things are going his way. Good punches coming in from Nigel Benn. The G-Man is in big big trouble. Big upper cut, he's wobbled, he's down. Last one, lovely boy. Eight, he's reached nine. It is all over. Benn is the winner. Benn is still the champion. - What? - Good news mate. False alarm. What you fucking talking about? That kid that got taken to hospital. Turns out he's an epileptic or something. Forgot to take his insulin. Them pills are sweet mate. Caw Pat, coming right on me. They're the best fucking pills I've ever taken in my life. No no no no no.
