But we are merely flesh and bone and what motivates us is our expression. That is the common thread that links us all to one another, That and mortality. [Dana] After all was said and done, we had each other. That's what we started it with and that's what we came out of this with. I don't think that anyone has loved me that way and I don't know if I will ever be loved that way again. We were going around the world playing music as we heard it the way we wanted to and we knew how lucky we were. In the beginning it was just a casual project just for experimentation's sake. Different? Yes. We're very happy to be back in your town tonight. Unique? Definitely. For here's a shot of Morphine By the time we reached the end of the tour, every show was sold out before we got there. I grabbed him by the chest and I go, "Hey! You're that guy from Morphine "and I'm Joe Strummer from the Clash. "Now come on!" But I thought the world won't like it, it's too crazy, I just thought it was the most amazing music I had ever heard. Morphine is one of those bands you keep in your arsenal, 'cause young people should really hear that. A two string bass, a baritone saxophone and drums. All righty, Morphine, live. From Boston, Massachusetts! Morphine! [music playing] [woman] It was cool. It was noir. It was sexy. It was late night. It was smokey. It was dangerous. ♪ Honey white Honey white ♪ ♪ Honey white...

I probably least of all would have thought, you know, I would have been in a band that would be successful. That I would actually be able to spend, you know, a good better part of a decade being a professional musician, would never have occurred to me. I always thought that was sort of pie in the sky. If you thought that that's what you wanted to get out of music then, you were going to be sorely disappointed. So, there had better be something more to it. You know, I'd paint houses during the day, and play at bars at night and pour everything you had into it when you could. And that was, uh... That's really what mattered the most to me. [Dave] Boston was a crazy place. The thing is, any night of the week, there would be a great show going on with local bands. You know, where you could go and just, they'd rock your socks off, you know? It was kind of an incestuous kinda scene, because you know, you'd have one guy that played in four different bands. You know, the bands or whatever, like revolving memberships all the time, a lot of the good bands. Please help me welcome Sandman from Boston. I remember meeting Mark at the Rat Skellar in Kenmore Square. He was playing in this band called Sandman. ♪ I'm gonna stop Getting high ♪ ♪ Then I'm gonna exercise [Dana] Here's this guy just delivering in a very raw, original way. He had a lot of that roots thing going, new wave punk attitude. And he had a baritone saxophone in that band. I ended up talking to him and... Not too long after that we started hanging out. We're doing a home movie tonight there, all right. [Dana] And then Mark and I started jamming. I was in law school at the time, and I would always be at my boyfriend's house hanging out. We had bands play every weekend. We called them rent parties. And I'd be sitting in the corner with my big old law books, and Mark Sandman would drop by and he would come up to me and he was like, "What are you reading?" And I would be like, "Oh, I'm reading contracts "or I'm reading property, or I'm reading criminal law." He would just be in amazement that I would be studying some pretty heavy stuff, while all this chaos was going on around me. And I think it impressed him a little bit to see how driven I was to my goal of becoming a lawyer and ultimately helping out bands. And I think in his mind, he saw me, you know, as maybe a resource for the future, to help him with his own endeavors. He was always trying out different combinations of bands.

The first time I met Mark was at Boston College, I was a disc jockey at WZBC, which is their college radio station. 90.3 in Newton, Massachusetts for those of you that are in the neighborhood, they're still around. Mark used to come by the station a lot with reel to reels of songs he had recorded at his house. And he came by with a track that he had done under the name The Pale Brothers. They both became hits on the college radio station. College radio in Boston has always been great. It still is great. You make a record, there's a radio station that will play it. There were bands like Bosstones, Face to Face, Treat Her right, all these bands, It was a scene like you can't believe. None of us had record deals, but we could fill a 1200 seat club. ♪ I'm going out now With this girl ♪ Treat Her Right was straight guitar blues you know, with a really wailing harmonica. Treat Her Right began as Sunday afternoon jam of some people that thought we should know each other. Mark Sandman played what he called a low guitar through an octave divider pedal, which dropped it an octave or two octaves where you could select it. And so it was kind of a bass guitar. ♪ What's your name? Bill Conway, first person I ever saw that played a cocktail drum. Which is one tall drum with a kick pedal on the bottom. It was a primitive beast of an instrument. But it was all low end. [Billy] We were into trying to make peoples hips move, you know like Muddy Waters music, where it hits you here, you know not here, but here. That was the last band in Boston that I remember being really big fan of. I went to see all the shows. Jerome was possibly Treat Her Right's biggest fan. I mean he loved the band. Bonnie Raitt was influential in their getting signed. They got signed to RCA. [Phil] I was a huge Treat Her Right fan. I was kind of the house guy at this little bar called the Brendan Behan in Jamacia Plain. Treat Her Right was one of the bands. And it just so happened we were leaving in about three days to go on a US tour, and our sound man was unable to go. So we're backstage and it's like, "What are we going to do?" And we're like, "The guy doing the gig here is really good." He gets what we're doing. You know, he's not trying to fix us, he understands these are the sounds we want, you know. So we said, "Phil, wanna go on tour?" "Yeah!" "Thursday?" [laughing] And the next thing I know, Sandman is asking me what my schedule is like next week. And Dana Colley, he and I were the road crew. We needed somebody to help with the road work, you know the gear and stuff and so we just asked Dana. And I went on the road with Treat Her Right as their guitar tech. They were opening up for Los Lobos, who happened to be like my favorite band in the world, because of Steve Berlin. [saxophone music playing] [Dana] Steve was one of the few saxophone players that was actually working and making rock music. I was a big fan of Treat Her Right. I knew when I saw they were going to be touring with us I was pretty excited. Morphine was starting to come together during this time as side project. Mark always had side projects. Morphine and Treat Her Right overlapped. And after a couple of days on the road with Treat Her Right, Mark was talking to Steve, and said, "Here, you know, check this out, "this is my new side project, have a listen." So he went back and had a listen and the next day he said, "Hey, who is the baritone saxophone player on the tape?" And Mark said "Well, see that kid over there "rolling up cords, "that's Dana, he's the sax player." "That guy?" I said, "The guitar guy?" They said "Yeah, he's a sax player too though." I said, "Well, he should be playing. "We should do some stuff together." [Dana] He said "Wow, jeez, does he have his horns? "You got to get him up here and play." He says, "Nah, he doesn't have a horn." Steve says, "Well, he can borrow mine." So I went backstage and knocked on the door. I said "Hey, Steve. I am a big fan, you know. "Mark said you would loan me your horn, I can't believe it." [Steve] It was pretty funny, because Dana was so shy and he was just kind of uneasy, until we kind of brought him into the fold. He said, "Yeah sure, sit down here, "I've got a couple of "different mouth pieces you can try out." And I said, "Jeez, well, "I hope you don't think I am too presumptuous here, "but I packed my mouth pieces just in case "this was gonna happen," you know. So we ended up doing a couple of songs, with Steve joining us on tenor. [Steve] He opened up. He just kind of had a bunch of questions about how I did what I did, which is, God knows no secret, I mean it's, uh... There's no mystery to it. He just opened up the book for me, he showed me everything there was. I can kind of hear the difference between how I was playing before I met Steve Berlin and after. He was horrible as a tech, but he was a great sax player. So by the end of the tour, Dana was on stage with us all the time. Yes, thank you very much. Dana Colley on baritone saxophone. Yes. And I'm out here touring with this awesome band that I'm a fan of. We had a band with three writers and three singers and there were three people that wanted the light on them at all times. [chuckles] We just weren't making any headway and we were tired of trying to make headway. Kind of said, "Okay, that's enough." [Phil] It culminated with South by SouthWest. And as were working our way down to Austin, I'm starting to pick up on the fact that this is it for Treat Her Right. They got dropped and the band is disbanding. [rock music playing] [audience cheering] [announcer] Give it up for Treat Her Right now... [audience cheering] They broke up, and so Mark made Morphine more of a focus. And Dana, we were already friends and he was over at the house. He had his baritone sax and we started playing together a little and... And it had a interesting sound and then I added my voice and we realized that everything's in the same range. And even though it was kind of sparse sounding, it seemed full to us, you know. So we decided to get a drummer and we figured, "Well, we'll do one show." Mark called me one day and he had what people referred to as the long pause. He sort of said "Hello" and... I was uncomfortable with the silence. Mark was a very cool customer and I was excited. {end-italic} [chuckles] I guess we just jammed on some things. I remember Mark saying Morphine. He already had the name for the band. I was sort of like okay, I didn't think much of it. It was a side project. [low rock music playing] [Jerome] In 1989, I think, we started doing gigs at the Middle East upstairs. It felt like something pretty cool was there right off the bat. The Middle East was just, you know, it's like the hub. It was where everybody hung out. On any given night, you would hear five or six different bands. I was bartending at the Middle East actually then. They got the whole community aspect of it and it was a very nurturing environment, I think for a lot of bands. It was younger, it was indie, it was punk, it had attitude. It wasn't like an established club at that point. 'Cause that's what Mark was really interested in establishing the band, but really coming from the underground. So it was always, always a hang, always a place to end up and Mark would always inevitably end up there. Especially because it was kind of down the street from where he lived. [rock music playing] It was a different sound. I mean it was a crazy, crazy sound. It opened up a kind of sonic territory. It was something that nobody else was doing. [rock music playing] There was something exciting about it, and for me being a sound man, how can you have a band without a guitar? I mean, there's no set way to mix that. You took it for granted with Mark, you know, that he was playing this two string slide bass, you know. And it's weird enough, you know, obviously to play a two string bass that doesn't give you, you know, necessarily all the options you'd want and even weirder to play it with a slide, but, of course, that was what gave it a unique sound. With no guitar in the band he would say, "The audience just kind of fills in the blanks "when it comes to the guitar sound." [Mark] Let me tell you about this song. This is a song called The Cherokee Dance, by Bob Froggy Landers. I just asked around and somebody told me they thought it was a bass string on a guitar. You know, this is what started it all off, it doesn't sound at all like Morphine. [rock music playing] And then I just started putting different kinds of bass strings on different guitars, and changing the action and pickups and... Started jamming with Dana and got a drummer and recorded some things and just sort of grew like that. So I'm developing as a music business professional. Morphine was getting more traction. They started to record the first album {end-italic} Good. Pretty much doing it on a budget, on a shoestring, on a dime. Everybody was producing their own record. And there were a lot of private recording studios being built. Fort Apache being one of them. Well, Paul Kolderie was, he was a mover and shaker. [Paul] Mark knew that I seemed to be able to get sounds that he liked, and we had some success in the past. Sometimes the best records come out of this sort of state of innocence where you don't really know what you're doing. You don't know why you're doing it. Nobody's looking over your shoulder, you're just doing it because you want to do it. The group wants to record and you just want to play. So I was like, "Oh, my God. "I'm graduating from law school. What am I going to do?" And I ended up getting a job at a record label called Taang Records. Mark somehow managed to record the first album Good, and he would come by every single week to Taang to take me out for coffee to pick my brain. And he'd be like, "What do you think of art? "What do you think of this song? "What do you think of this track order?" For a long time, he had been wooing me, and I didn't realize it. Mark basically just stole her. I said, "I can't quit my job. I need to get paid. "I need to make money." "You keep your day job "and we'll just see how this goes." And I was like, "I'm not a manager. I run a record label. "I've never been a manager before." And he's like, "Don't worry. "We'll co-manage. "I'll teach you how to be a manager." And, you know, I just loved the music so much. And I was like, "You know what? "I really want to do this." [rock music playing] [Billy] Jerome and I, having known each other for so long, we're fans of each other's playing. So when I saw him with Morphine for the first time, what he was doing didn't seem unusual to me. It seemed like a further extension of things we'd already been developing. [Jerome] In 1990, I started to get sort of an arthritis pain in my hands. It was just no fun. [Billy] As Jerome started to physically just not be able to play. And that was sort of the beginning of any problem between me and Mark. He just wanted me to keep playing, He was like, "Take a bunch of aspirin. "It's all in your head. " 'Cause I didn't know what the problem was. I played on the recording sessions for Good, then I stopped playing. Either Jerome would call or Mark would call and say, "Hey, look you want to play some gigs? "Jerome is just not up to it." The agreement was very clear. It's like, this is your gig, Jerome. I'll play them, you know, while you're recuperating, or whatever is going on with you. And when you're up and ready, you know, it's obviously your gig. Jerome Deupree is back in the drummer's seat. How about a hand for Jerome. [audience applause] Gone for a whole year. We want to dedicate this song to Billy Conway. [Billy] And then health sort of came back some, but not fully. So sometimes I'd go to gigs and just wait in the wings in case he couldn't finish the gig. [rock music playing] [Deb] I think he must have sent out 100 cassettes of Good to different Indie labels to try to get signed. The early days of having cassettes and passing them out, handing them out with Xerox-ed cover copies, very grassroots from the street up. And there just wasn't a lot of response. People didn't really get it. Which explains why they are the first act on the Accurate Distortion label. The record came out on a local record label Rush Gershon's Accurate label. Let's have a big hand for three men with a lot of low sounds, Morphine. I wound up to be the first disc jockey ever to play Morphine on the radio. [Jerome] So we put that out. That got a certain amount of radio play, college stations, CMJ liked it. One of the last things I did was a short tour in California. Thank you very much. We're called Morphine, we're out here, traveling around from Boston, Massachusetts. [audience cheering] That's where we come from. That's where we live. [rock music playing] ♪ I feel lucky ♪ {end-italic} I just feel that way ♪ ♪ I'm on the bus To Atlantic City ♪ ♪ Later on today ♪ Players win, winners play ♪ Have a lucky day Somehow, it was just never the same. You know, we had this very easy going, mellow character on the outside but, for the first time, I realized that he really didn't want to be challenged. I went to Bunratty's to go see them and halfway through the show Mark announces that, "This is the last show ever with Jerome Deupree." And I'm thinking, what? When Jerome left the band, he was dealing with a lot of physical ailments, and it was hard for Mark to accept. And I think it was hard for Jerome that Mark wasn't willing to accept. Mark didn't want to be held back by anything or anybody. You know, I remember the night when I finally quit. Dana, being the only who sort of said, "Wait a minute, can't we talk this out?" And Mark and I were... I mean, almost simultaneously like, "No." I wasn't thinking. I should have known that something was going to happen. You know, we're going to watch this band possibly or probably go on to relative fame and fortune. And I'm not going to be a part of it anymore. So I got offered the gig and, you know, I said, "Yeah, sure. Count me in." You know? I wasn't mad at Billy in any way, but it was tough to see. Thank you very much. We've got Billy Conway on the drums back here, ladies and gentlemen. The minimalist approach that Billy Conway brought to the band, playing a very small jazz type of kit. [Mark] Billy Conway, our drummer, is a fantastic drummer, probably has more dynamics than almost any drummer I can think of. [Sabine] Mark, he was always out playing. And Boston is a small town, so we knew each other. I think the one night, the way he tells it, he was playing and he'd seen me before a lot of times, but one night he just saw me. He looked at me, and he cocked head and he thought, "Hmm." He pursued me pretty relentlessly, right at a time when he was just like, "This is it, "I'm giving up on this one." I just looked at him and thought, "I think I'm in love with this man." They were made for each other, Mark and Sabine. [Deb] Sabine, who was this incredible, exotic, intelligent, well read, fiery woman that just brought out the best in Mark. As they fell in love, you saw a change in Mark. I saw him become softer. [Sabine] I was bartending at the Middle East, and he'd always come by and hang out. And I'd make special concoctions and drinks. Temptation. I think people misunderstood him, his personality, his music, as sort of noirish or dark. Or that he was this kind of morose sort of depressed figure, or something like that. But he was actually one of the most positive, forward thinking people I've ever met. The thing about Mark was Mark was always writing. And not only was he always writing, he was always recording. He had a home studio, he called it Hi-n-Dry. [Mark] It's a revolution. It's unbelievable. It's just in the last three or four years it's just gotten cheaper and cheaper to buy professional recording equipment, And which is what this is, you know. I mean, we put one of these recordings on our albums. There's nothing wrong with them. It strikes me that Mark and the Morphine guys were extraordinarily creative. They had such a limited set of resources musically that they gave to themselves. So they really had to think carefully about how to rearrange it, or how to reimagine it. And that's where the real musicianship comes in. Mark would have sheets of lyrics, all kinds of them. And we'd just be jamming, and he'd just pull the sheet out and start these lyrics. If it didn't fit over that groove, he might try it over another groove, or pull out a different sheet of lyrics. [Henry] The lyrics really get to some real essential life stuff. Like he was writing from a very remote place in his thinking. [Steve] Part of what made Morphine so unique was that they understood, innately, how to leave enough space for the songs to breathe and not just sound like a big rumbly mess which is what would be in almost anybody else's hands. The second album we spent as much as the first album. It was about $6000-7000 or something. Here we made this Guerilla Record in a hole in the wall place. We cut mostly {end-italic} Cure for Pain in that weird sort of dead time between Christmas and New Year's. Four or five more days of screwing around with the stuff and fixing it up and by the end we realized we were kind of screwing it up by mixing it too much. [Dana] I remember when we finished mixing {end-italic} Cure for Pain, going to the job site the next day, and I put it in the BoomBox and I let it rip and I think for the first time in my life I felt like what I was hearing I wasn't cringing when I was listening to it. You know, I felt that it had a life of its own. ♪ Let's take a trip together ♪ Headlong into The irresistible orbit ♪ I just remember listening to that cassette coming out of the Boombox and thinking, "Wow, "I wonder how long it's going to be "before I'm listening to this coming off the airwaves." Paul Kolderie's girlfriend Carrie Svingen heard it and she's the publicist at Rykodisc. And she fell in love with this music. She is basically the person responsible for getting Morphine signed to Rykodisc. We were the first live band that Rykodisc ever signed. Because they were a catalog company re-issuing everything on CD, because CD's had just become the new technology. [Deb] Yes, he signed the contract with Ryko, and then he paid me with an electric guitar. I am only going to tell you this once but, we sold our record and have taken it off the market. So there's only a few left for a while. So if that doesn't get you to buy it then, it's the end of the commercial. [rock music playing] ♪ She had black hair Like ravens ♪ ♪ Crawling down her shoulder ♪ All the way down [Deb] The thing about it was this song just got you in your solar plexus and made you want to dance, or have sex, or eat, or drink, or you know, just have this really visceral, amazing impact on you. [rock music playing] The fact that you had Dana, Mark and Billy, like guys who really understood how to make it work. They seemed to find the secret sauce, or that combination with that sort of austerity and sparseness of sound. It really, really, really takes incredibly understanding and gifted players to make it sound full. I was looking for various jobs and I ran into a friend of mine. She said, "Oh, you know, "you should follow my friend Deb Klein. "She managers Morphine." I said, "Really? "They have a manager? They're that busy?" And I called her up and she said, "Come in. You can be my one day a week intern. "I'll pay you $30." I just started showing up every day. I had gotten accepted to this grad school up in New Hampshire. And so pretty much at the beginning of our relationship, we... He went on tour and I moved. [Deb] We played small clubs. 300 to 500 capacity clubs. We were headlining. I think I had the guys in the van first time around. Mark was tour managing. We had one crew person, our sound guy, and that was pretty much it. [Billy] It was a whole U.S. tour. It was a lot of shows. And send in our records ahead to college radios, see if we could get a little buzz going before we got there and sometimes there'd be 30 people and sometimes 10. [Dana] I think when we were first hitting the road, Kate gave me this Polaroid, which is one of them sitting up there. And, you know, a cloth covered parchment filled book and said, "You're going to want to keep notes." And I immediately just fell into it. I started taking pictures and taking out my little glue gun and sticking the pictures on the page and then, you know, writing whatever inscription I could think of. "Just returned from our gig at the Somewhere Else Tavern "in Greensboro, North Carolina. "It's a small, privately owned bar, "runned by a burly guy by the name of well, Burly. "There we played a very small but attentive show "for some 30 people, most of which were very enthusiastic. "We pocketed a whole 75 bucks for a show in a state, "that despite all of the good intentions of many individuals "lacked for any real turnout. "The first time through "we can expect much of the same. "But I hope that the hot spots, "Athens, Atlanta, New Orleans, "Austin, Chicago will be promising." We were loading out and the guy who owned the place says, "You know, I hope you guys enjoyed the ride. "You're on your way." And I just looked at him. I said, "What do you know that I don't know?" The next night we're in Atlanta and it was sold out. All of a sudden, all of these amazing things started to happen and a lot of it had to do with how well marketed and how well conceived the pitch was that Carrie Svingen our publicist had. Mr. Sandman, bring me your dreams and the sultry sexiness of the sound. Journalists just fell in love with it. Different? Yes. Unique? Definitely. Exciting? Well, here's a shot of Morphine. People were discovering it in a cool way. On college radio, alternative radio. You know, we had an NPR feature. It was bringing accolades from really disparate sources. In the early 90's, here comes Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Jane's Addiction, The Pixies and other bands that broke through. All of a sudden, FM radio is making room. Which made alternative music possible for wider acceptance. It was a good time for Morphine to be doing what they were doing, as far as what American youthful ears were ready to hear. And that's the first time I heard them. We'd play a show one night, and the next day somebody would check in with Deb and she'd go, "Oh, Cleveland sold out." And then call back and like, "Chicago has just sold out." I mean, granted these are not the enormadomes but, doesn't matter where you're playing, if the house is full of people that want to see it, that makes for a big night. Cure for Pain was starting to get played, on commercial radio as well. Something had happened that the wheel was really turning and people were coming out in droves to see us. Which was amazing. Like here's this band, their first tour, no one had really ever heard of them. But by the time we reached the end of the tour, every show was sold out before we got there. Things were happening so quickly. I didn't really even realize it at the time. But things were moving so fast.

"Cure for Pain is on the radio station "107.9 WENZ The End "in Cleveland now three times a day. "The DJ and program director "has created an incredible interest "in his listeners for the effects of Morphine. "The station has a strong frequency east, "and at this point, we're still getting in it in strong. "And we just crossed the border." [Deb] Mark really wanted to break overseas. And one of the great things about Rykodisc actually was that it was an international company with offices in London, and we really believed and felt that this Morphine sound would do very well in Europe. When they were looking at going to Europe, they said, "You know, we can't afford "to fly your sound guy." And Mark said, "Well, "our sound guy doesn't go, we don't go." Phil Davidson back on the sound, ladies and gentlemen. How's he doing? That, at the time blew me away. I mean, I was a young guy, you know, I had my insecurities, and I hadn't done any international touring before. Phil did every single Morphine show. Not only did he get what we're doing, but he was able to make any sound system sound better. We called Phil our credit card, we never left home without him. [Deb] I was getting my band over to Europe for the first time. It was a big international festival for new artists. We were greeted by the French press as if we were the Beatles. The entire town were like waiting for us. It was bizarre. It was so bizarre. But the very first show was at this festival and we went on at about 3 o'clock in the morning. It was almost like an arena. It was huge. We played our full set, 90 minute set, at which point the house manager said, "The house is yours. "You're feel to play for as long as you want." Just full house just cheering and we played until the sun came up.

It kind of like set up our career. And there were some really cool bands that were coming out of Boston at that time like The Pixies, you know, Morphine was another one. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Lemonheads. I mean, there were like some really cool acts. But Morphine was the one that kind of like... they shined on their own. And a lot of it, I think, had to do with some of that international appeal and just the incredible press we got. And we went down, and we did our big showcase at South by Southwest. And we opened up for Alejandro Escovedo, and that was really what broke it wide open after that. [rock music playing] People wanted to put Morphine's music into film and television. And so we had some early licensing opportunities that really kicked sales. Cure for Pain was used extensively in the independent film Spanking the Monkey. It totally came out of left field, but it propelled the band and the record at the same time. And they were in the record stores. And people were buying the record. "Some time at home and then the Austin "for a couple of days. Then Chicago and so forth. "The increased interest in Morphine "has been somewhat staggering, "with MTV running us in this Week in Rock, "which guarantees us enormous exposure, "the Rolling Stone articles and the Conan O'Brien bit. "It all seems kind of funny, "because here we are just four guys in a van. "We've sold out every show with no exception. "And now, shows are sold out "even before we get into town, like tonight." The next record that came out on Rykodisc was called Yes. The Yes {end-italic} record was being finished up. I remember that was very exciting. That was where I really started to feel like I was part of the process. The demos of the new songs would come in and Deb would listen to them, and I'd get to be there and listen to them. [Dana] We all got these 8 tracks. It was pretty much the work horse for Morphine, because we would just get together and play and then roll tape. [music playing] And then Mark would make a mix down of that session. I could take it home and add tracks. The concept was, tape is cheap. Tape was always rolling. Jam for a few hours, listen back through the tapes, surf through them. "Hey, that was cool." [rock music playing] After that record came out, and it wasn't performing as well, maybe, as {end-italic} Cure for Pain had, you know, we started to say, well what are our options? But we were touring and our touring business was going great and our merchandise business was going great. But it was the record sales that were just like, okay, well, we got the music out there, we made this amazing record, but it's not getting to a bigger audience. Well, we'll just do it the old fashioned way via touring. Worldwide, Japan, Australia, Monterey Jazz Festival. Festivals in Belgium were out of control. Just thousands of people as far as the eye can see. We've probably played like eight or nine festivals this weekend, I mean, this summer. Three this weekend. We did one in Holland called Pinkpop, it's really big. Like almost, I think, as big as this. 60.000, 70.000 people. And some in France. Some big ones in France and Belgium. Yeah, it was fucking cool, you know, just to watch what was happening to them. [rock music playing] ♪ I got a head with wings ♪ I got a head with wings ♪ And I can see so far away I can see far away ♪ ♪ I can see the shadows Fall across your face ♪ ♪ I got a head with a head With wings ♪ You see you find yourselves sorting of hanging out when you're doing these festivals. Michael Stipe in R.E.M. was headlining one of the Belgium festivals. Mike Mills invited us all backstage and, you know, and you just, it was just like, wow! "Yesterday, a star studded backstage. "PJ Harvey, Michael Stipe and Belly "watched from the wings. "From my very strained peripheral vision "I could see PJ sitting regally upon "the highest row case perch, "dressed in black leather pants, black boots, black top, "black hair, and minimal post-show makeup. "Michael, standing behind the stack of row cases, "making it nearly impossible to keep from looking "side stage let alone forget that they were there. "After the show I was able to meet both Michael and Polly. "Both were so genuine "that it was almost easy to forget the waves of nervous, "star struck sensations that may have accounted "for my overflow of uncontrollable gushing." You know, you're out there playing music and it comes back to you that one of your heroes liked your music. You can't beat it. I'm walking through the crowd at Glastonbury and we're talking about a big festival here, you know, 100.000 people out on a summer set kind of valley. I'm just walking through the crowd, and I see coming towards me Morphine like in an arrowhead formation. [Dana] So a guy with like this sort of sheik's, you know, headdress, sunglasses walks up to Mark. And I grab him by the chest and I go, "Hey! You're that guy from Morphine." And he goes, "Who are you?" And I go, "I'm Joe Strummer from The Clash, come on." It's like, what? Joe Strummer? I just happened to have my Polaroid with me. I guess we're not that far off the track if Joe Strummer stopped to say hello. The European festivals with Morphine were, you know, those were good times. And Henry Rollins is like... He's intense. And we get to watch his set side stage, black shorts, that's it. And he's just like arrrgg! And just muscles popping out and everything. Really nice guy by the way. We would do the European festivals and Morphine would be on the bill. And I went up to him and said, "Hey Henry, "I really, really enjoyed your set, "you know, I'm with Morphine." And the steam is just rising up from his body. And he was like, "Oh, hey. "Thanks, man. I really appreciate it." And shook my hand. I'll never forget, I think we were playing Lowlands, and we were playing pretty much at the same time. And so between our songs which were like this, you know, wall of immense DB. You could hear them. And so it was like this weird mix of between songs. I kind of listen as my guys are tuning up, I'm listening to what they're doing over there. I'm like, "Oh, I like that song. "Oh, we have to do our song." And so it's like this interesting moment of like getting like, going to a gig while you're doing a show yourself. Mark said, "We need a tour manager for this. "I'm tired of doing it myself." And Deb said, "Well, I'll look around and I'll find one." Mark said, "No, we all like Hamilton." He used to call me "Hamiltone". My job was to make sure that everything was in check. That the hotels were paid for, we got to the shows on time, the driver got paid, the bus got taken care of, we got paid at the end of the night and on to the next city. Do it over and over and over again. And I was like, "You're going to pay me money to do this?" I'm Baghead. Good morning from Baghead! Let's go all the time. [audience cheering] "It is time to take the stage. The house is packed. "We ascend the stairs to the stage alone in thought. "One by one we follow the beam of guiding Maglite. "Some adjustments, some introductions, "and we're off for 90 minutes. 90 minutes. "Months of phone calls, arrangements, "contract riders, tech specifications, "days of travel, hours of preparation "and miles of pacing and bottles of Tequila. "All come down to just 90 minutes of actual playing time. "And then you're done. "You descend the stairs to the dressing room, "open a beer, have a smoke, but silence is mandatory. "An attempt to grasp what it was that just happened." [Hamilton] Mark liked to play multiple nights in a smaller room. Which meant they usually had a sellout. When you have a sellout, you get to write the rules. [Deb] You know and he learned a lot from Treat Her Right. He was going to take those experiences, and he was going to do everything right the second time around. But he made a lot of weird rules around that. It was all about creative control. Creative control over the art. Creative control and approvals over the music. Creative control over how the songs were licensed. It was about the music for him, and that's why he was often so ridged about how something had to be. Never opening for anybody else. You know, you get no respect. You don't get a sound check. I mean, they always did a shot of Tequila before they played. Flowers on stage, fresh flowers, sunflowers. Always comes out with me on tour. It's the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Soundtrack to Once upon a Time in the West. [Deb] So every band in the world, to this day, you get off stage, you get on your bus, you leave at 2:00 in the morning and you wake up the next day in the city that you're going to play. Not Mark Sandman. He only wanted to play major cities. He wanted to hang with the denizens of the nightlife. [Phil] He was all about not following the rules. But in a sense, he had his own rules. It's like, "Look, I've worked hard my whole life, "and now I want to tour the way I want to tour. "And if people don't like it, too bad." People say, "It must be really awesome "flying all over the world, "getting to see all these places," and it's like, "Yeah, lots of airports, "hotels "and venues. "Occasional restaurant." One thing that I learned on the road with Morphine, every radio disc jockey asks the same question. In every city, every day, over and over and over again. There was one time the radio host started with, "So, how's the tour going?" Mark said, "Well, why don't you ask our tour manager?" As Mark would get up and walk away. We were on tour in Scotland, traveling in what we like to call a bread truck. Basically, it was the size of a bread truck and inside there was a table and two bench seats facing each other. Which after a while can get kind of old. I was pissed about something, and I just unloaded on Mark, "Fuck you!" And I'll never forget, he was able to say, "Okay, "all right, yeah, I get it. You're pissed at me, "but let's separate the issues. "Let's take them one at a time." In my mind it was like it's so glamorous. He's traveling here and there and adoring public, and he's doing all this cool stuff. And he kept telling me like, "Man, most of it just sheer boredom and you're waiting." Well, we miss our girlfriends, you know. That's hard. And not just our girlfriends, but our whole life at home, but, when we're out on the road, we're so busy and traveling in a different place every day that you, kind of, you get home sick sometimes. "Somewhere over the Atlantic en route to Boston "flight 215 British Airlines. "The anticipation of seeing Kate's face "upon arrival seems to hold time still. "People moving about the cabin, "hovering in a bucket of bolts en route to Boston. "Six hours or so before touchdown, "Top Cat, a 50's, 60's cartoon "is playing is in the in-flight TV. "Cool, jazzy bebop background music the redeeming factor. "Billy, Phil and myself occupy three of the four seats "in the middle of the plane. "With Mark fast asleep "occupying the unused seats to the left. "Two glasses of red wine, one James Ellroy book, "shoes off, time and nothing but. "Many places, many people." We had these old Facsimile fax machines. We all bought our girlfriends fax machines. We send long faxes or short ones, or whatever we feel like, I guess. He would send postcards and we would write a lot through the fax. So it was tough, definitely. But he was definitely determined to make it work. And we were in love. Morphine live.

Including one of the first bands to join Steven Spielberg's new record label. You're going to sample some Morphine next. [Deb] You know, we started to say, "Well, what are our options here?" We still had two more records left with Rykodisc. So we worked out a deal with Rykodisc where there was a joint venture between Ryko and DreamWorks, essentially where DreamWorks would end up releasing the subsequent records. And we just really liked the name, you know. It just felt DreamWorks, Morphine, Sandman. It just made sense, you know? There's just something in the universe that was like this is the place for us. So DreamWorks steps in, now we're making a record and we've got this giant new label. And that's when the business stuff with Morphine really started to change. There was more money, you know, more money to spend on things, more marketing. [Billy] Like Swimming might have been a record we had a little more trouble with. The record did not feel as seamless as maybe some of the others. And maybe not as realized. The one significant change going from Rykodisc to DreamWorks would be in the delay of the release of Like Swimming. It was a bit of a momentum killer. When we came out on this major label and trying to compete with all of these other acts, it was a much more crowded playing field. So we struggled, you know? It wasn't as easy as we might have thought it would have been having this big machine behind us. People were saying, "Oh, it sounds like, "sounds like Morphine." or, "It sounds like "what you have done before." If you have how many countless guitar bands that all sound alike and here you have a band that is being kind of criticized for sounding like themselves. [Deb] It wasn't getting on the radio. Number one in college radio, number one Triple AAA, but we never got that big breakthrough mainstream moment where we were like top ten on the radio. It just eluded us. So the idea or the answer to that was that we were going to do a remix of the song, and of Early to Bed. And we got the Dust Brothers who produced the Beastie Boys record to remix {end-italic} Early to Bed, and they did this super cool mix that we thought would be very contemporary. It would like play right up against the Beck's of the world or the Beastie Boys and give it that real alternative sound that we needed and Mark hated it. And he said no. He said no. And his record company begged him and I begged him and he was like, "It doesn't sound like Morphine, "and I'm not going to let somebody put something up "that isn't representative of Morphine's sound." But at the same time, I think, we were veterans enough that you make a record and you move on. In those days, the 90's. You would do an album and your A&R guy would start talking to you about, "Okay, here is what we think is the single "and here's what we want to do for a video." And you would have to take all of this very seriously, like, okay. That record we had Early to Bed, it was like the first music video that we made with a real budget. That video got nominated for a Grammy. [Phil] They're this monster, this three headed monster. It was the Morphine entity. But that's how those days were. It was a bit of gold rush, in that, you know, get your band on MTV, get them on the radio, go, go, go. And it sounds corny, but when they would show a minute of your video on {end-italic} Beavis and Butt head, you could literally watch your sound scan rise. People would see that, and they would go right to the strip mall, and they would consume. Mark was settling down and kind of reestablishing his relationship with his family and showing his parents that he had made it. [Dana] He didn't talk much about his family. In fact, {end-italic} Like Swimming we went to his parents' house because we wanted to get some underwater shots and his folks had a pool, so we went, they opened up the house to us. That was the first time I'd actually realized that Mark came from a home. Didn't crawl out of the pack of wolves. [Phil] But that was Mark. Not to say that he wouldn't open up, but he wouldn't offer a lot of details about himself. Well, Mark was nine years older than me, so he had had a pretty full life before I'd even met him. So I'd catch wind of stories of his life in Colorado and Breckinridge and living in the miners shacks and kind of being a Jack Kerouac character, you know? He went to Alaska to work on a fishing boat. And by the time I'd met him, I could just barely believe any of this stuff. But he was kind of following a trail that these kind of wanderers were at the time. He drove a taxi. I mean, he had every odd job you can imagine. Always in support of his art. Mark came to L.A. we were, you know, I was just in a mood that I felt like being a tour guide. So we were riding around L.A., and he told us the story about when he was a cab driver. He had these tremendous scars on his body. And Mark was a thin guy. They were really heavy scars. And I asked him about them, and he didn't go into great detail. But apparently, he was mugged when he was a cab driver. I guess somebody tried to rip him off and had stabbed him in his heart. And the guy like reached over the seat and ripped him with a knife. I just remember thinking, "Wow, that's kind of a heavy thing "to walk around with knowing "that there's a hole in your heart." But it didn't seem to slow him down very much. He was just so nonplussed about it. Just kind of, "Oh, yeah, well, you know, this happened." Well, Mark had lost two brothers and he had suffered a lot of loss in his life. [Dana] I'm sure there was a lot of pain and struggling with the guilt of being a survivor with having two brothers who passed away and being an older brother. There was a couple of years in my life where I had a lot of... There was some deaths in the family and some friends of mine died and... Really makes you concentrate on the present and not waste any time doing anything you don't want to do, because you just never know. You never know what's going to happen to you. So I think that probably influenced me to just keep playing music and not, you know, just live from month to month and come up with the rent somewhere. "Back on the road, "start of two months of work. "Which will take us through Colorado for a week, "home, then to Japan, France, and then home, "and then Australia, New Zealand, "and around the world twice in under three months. "Little is expected of us except to play "and to sign autographed copies "of CD's, posters, tickets, dollar bills. "We have a driver who drives us up to the spot "where a crew loads us in, sets us up "and points us to the direction of the stage, "the dressing room, the food, "the hotel, the bus, repeat. "However, this is the nuts and bolts of touring, "the long haul. "The smoother the system or the formula, "the better we get as a band." What are your plans for future directions? More recordings? Yeah, we're going to be recording some more when we get home. Any new sounds we might be looking forward to in Morphine? Yeah, there'll be some new sounds, but they're indescribable. [low rock music playing] ♪ Early to bed And early to rise ♪ ♪ Makes a man or woman Miss out on the nightlife ♪ ♪ Early to bed And early to rise ♪ ♪ Makes a man or woman Miss out on the nightlife ♪ He started working on songs for The Night pretty much as soon as Like Swimming {end-italic} was out. Mark loved ethnic music. He was really getting into that very Middle Eastern type of sound. So we were looking at expanding the sound of Morphine. It would always be the three piece live, but on record looking for other sounds. [Mark] This is the newest instrument here. This is the tritar. One bass string and two guitar strings, and I'm looking for satisfying warmth in the low end. But still a balance for the high notes. Because I'm asking a lot from this guitar, I'm asking it to be two things. Well, The Night {end-italic} was probably the most harrowing of all. Mark was under enormous pressure to meet the expectations of a major record company and for the first time that was hovering over the entire process. The label wanted to have insurance that they were going to have success. That there was going to be a defined hit on the record. So it was like keep writing, keep writing, that's not it, that's not it. We made the record with Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade. They were going to produce with Mark. People who stand to make a lot of money are watching every move you do. That was a big problem. And I think he was struggling with methods to get back to that sort of unconsciousness. That sort of lack of inhibition. That sort of lack of self-consciousness. Something wasn't quite right and that Mark and Paul were at odds. And Mark was feeling like either the reins were being pulled away from him or, for some reason, he didn't feel like it was going in the direction he wanted it to go. Billy was in the hot seat because Mark was looking at the idea of working with other drummers. There was a period where they're bringing every drummer in town looking for the right drummer to make it happen. Which I'd literally come home some days from the studio and go, "I don't know whether I quit or I got fired today, "but I'm not going back tomorrow." [Deb] It wasn't an easy time. I mean, I think there was a lot of struggle going into making The Night. There was a lot more input from the label on an A&R side than we had ever had before. DreamWorks and L.A. were trying to get Mark working with Beck's horn section, and we were all fighting for our jobs, it felt like. Mark and Paul stopped working together. Mark's confidence was shook. And I think it had to do with a lot of pressures and, you know, having a falling out with Paul. You know, that was hard on him. Those two guys had been friends for a long time, too. It was the first I recalled saying, "You know, look, dude, we can do this. You can do this." You know, filling somebody up with some confidence that they lost somewhere along the way. He definitely was feeling a lot of pressure from DreamWorks to, you know, finish the record and, you know deliver radio hits. Whatever radio hits are, and he was looking for a house to buy with Sabine, his girlfriend. So there was a lot of going on. So, for various reasons, that was a very difficult process and time period for the band. It was definitely weighing on all of us. And Mark decided we were going to start over, and go back to his place Hi-n-Dry, and start from scratch. [Sabine] Also, because we lived in this space where he was recording and making all this music, I think part of me just shut a certain part of that process off because it was our home and once everybody left it was like where we made dinner and hung out and watched movies. He had a lot of money at that point. And we had put a down payment on a house. We had been looking and looking and finally found a place. And I think I was thinking about kids in the back of my mind. So there was a whole slew of recordings that got made with a whole slew of drummers, and eventually that really didn't work out. And then we brought Jerome in. [Jerome] He asked me to come back and record. They were just still trying to get anything. [Dana] I think he had to kind of, you know, reconcile with Jerome. I think there was one day he asked me to come in by myself and just him and me. And that just didn't feel right. And I think I had already said that I wanted Billy there, but at that point I was adamant. I said, "I'm not going to do this "if Billy Conway isn't playing with me." And Mark was like, "You know, I love Billy. "I love his playing. I love his personality. "But I love Jerome. "But I can't get them both." I said, "Mark, well there's your answer." Billy and Jerome don't have a problem with each other. Jerome and I, we like loved to play together. [drums music playing] [Jerome] Billy and I ended up recording {end-italic} The Night, virtually everything side by side. [Billy] Then that kind of became the rhythm section for that record I remember we recorded the song {end-italic} The Night. We sort of said, "It's coming in focus now." We did a little short tour with the two of them, and there were times when you could just stop playing because the two of them would just, you know, be enough. We figured the record was pretty much done. 99% done. [Dana] Got to place where we were satisfied. One of the first times in recent memory that I had seen Mark sort of relax because we had finished it. And we were happy with it. And Mark was happy with it. And it was like this cloud had lifted. We decided to go to Europe without Jerome. It was just the trio, and, you know, put some wind in our sails and come back back and finish the details, you know. That was the plan, basically, was for them to go do the summer festivals, put out the record in the fall. And we were asked to play this festival in Italy and our agent was, you know, he was like, "Well, I'm not so sure about this one." Actually looking forward to going to Europe. Said, "Okay, we'll do ten days in Europe." But that tour came together at the last minute and it didn't make sense, financially, for me to go on that tour. We were working so hard and {end-italic} The Night had been such an arduous process of soul searching and wondering if we could succeed or if we could continue, or if we would even be in a band together. And realizing that after all was said and done we had each other. That's what we started with, and that's what we came out of this with. We played at the World's Fair in Central Square to an enormous turnout. You know, Mass Ave. and all you could see was people. It was like a send off. I remember everybody getting together at Mark's house the morning that they went to the airport. We all met over at Mark's loft to load up the van to go to the airport. I don't really even know why, but I went to say goodbye. I went into the loft, and Mark had this thing where he always packed. I'd seen it on the other little tour. He never packed until the morning they were leaving. So you'd get there and he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. He was really looking forward to this tour. He was going to some of his favorite places, Portugal and Spain first. [Phil] We did this festival in Lisbon, and it was particularly hot. [rock music playing] And so, when we sound checked, it was the afternoon. And the sun was right on the stage. Mark told me he got dizzy on stage. Bordered on heat stroke. [crowd cheering] ♪ She wrapped me up Well, saved me for later ♪ ♪ Left me no way To penetrate her ♪ ♪ Guess that was what I needed at the time ♪ ♪ Guess that was what I needed at the time ♪ ♪ I guess that was what I needed at the time ♪ ♪ A good woman Is hard to find ♪ [audience cheering] "July 2, 1999, 4:05 p.m. "Flying to Rome from Lisbon. "Played yesterday "at the same venue we played last time "we were here in 98, the Expo Center. "The scorching midday heat saturated the stage "during sound check making it difficult to combat. "My reeds and horns were burning up. "Mark red faced and glassy eyed "fought off fainting. "Each breath I took "was met with a blast furnace of hot air. "Like a shotgun into my mouth and lungs." So we, you know, played Portugal and had a nice time and headed over to Italy. We flew to Rome and then drove to Palestrina. Palestrina is one of the most gorgeous little towns outside of Rome. It's a Pre-Roman town, so it's very, very ancient. And it's built on a hill. So you can see it. It has this amazing structure that goes all the way up... ...until the Temple of the Fortune. [Dana] And Palestrina is built on this hill and the concert was staged at the base of the hill. And you walk up these ancient stairs to like a piazza, and we were staying in a hotel next to the piazza, and then you would continue up these stairs where all the different houses and apartments were, and all the way to the top where there was this Temple of Fortuna. And there was a real passion that you could feel in this festival. [Massimo speaking in Italian] One of the strongest memories I have is coming back down, at the venue the morning after the arrival, and Mark was already having coffee with some of the people there, sitting on one of the benches. [Massimo speaking in Italian] It was just an amazing place. I'd never seen anything like it. And there was just such a calm, and we were sitting in taking in the sounds and just saying, "Wow, this is great." We were here a day early, we can relax in this beautiful place. And Mark was really eager to get down to sound check. And when we did our sound check... I think some of us were going to go take a walk up the hill to see the temple, I remember Mark sort of being concerned. He was like, "Oh, no. Are you guys sure you want to do that?" "It's a long walk, it's hot. "Why don't you just hang out?" We walked up the stairs after sound check, and it was a steep set of stairs, and it was hotter than blazes, you know? And Mark was moving slow. Walking up a steep set of stairs on a hot day and somebody is tired. It didn't seem unusual. At 7 o'clock, I went up to the hotel to get Morphine and Mark, and take them to the festival venue. And Mark said, "Yes, I'm so excited. "I like this venue. I like this park. "I like the Palestrina people." He was preparing what he wanted to say on stage in Italian. Because he wanted to make sure that they would understand him and he could get straight to their heart. So we went to festival venue, the backstage. I remember Morphine getting on stage and just having this amazing show. It was packed. So we go about, we play our show, and in the middle of show... I kind of felt like there was a moment in {end-italic} Sharks Patrol These Waters in where he performed it really differently. But my sense was that he wasn't feeling right. And then you're playing along and... It was the seventh song in, Super Sex. Mark's playing was suddenly off, and he went way out of tune. And I just saw from the corner of my eye, just kind of saw his knees buckle, and sort of heard this sound of the bass kind of droning in a low open string. And I looked over and I just saw him fall back into his bass amp. And I looked up and he just dropped. I ran over to him, and I remember shouting at him to hang in there and... [Phil] There happened to be some paramedics right down in the front row. They jumped up on stage and tried to work on him. You know, and all hell breaks loose and the chaos of something tragic like that happening in a public forum like that, and everybody trying to make it better and... [speaking in Italian] We went to the hospital with Mark. And it was kind of bizarre in that... For whatever reasons we could see the emergency room from the parking lot area where we were standing. Whatever reasons the curtains were open. We could see it. And we saw them put the sheet over his head after they'd done everything they could in the hospital. And I remember the doctor coming over the window and just closing the curtain. In the moment of terror and disbelief, we saw him die in front of our faces. And then the night stretching into, you know, this sort of Fellini like Dreamscape, where you're trying to make sense of an event that nobody could have ever planned for. It was just one of those moments, you know, where you just... Your idea of what you know is slowly dwindling and being eroded. And replaced with a whole new world of unknown. I was the first person to get through to someone back in the States and it was my wife at the time. And she managed to get a hold of Deb Kline. [Deb] I love to fly kites, and there's this great hill in Boston where it's always windy. I was flying my kite and thinking of the guys off on their tour. I was having a really nice day. And I'm driving home, and my phone rings and Martha's on the phone. That's Phil Davidson's wife. And she said, "Are you driving?" And I said, I said, "Yeah, I'm driving. "I'm just coming home from the park." She said, "You need to pull over." And I'm like, "What? Why do I need to pull over?" And I pull over. I said, "What's wrong?" And she said, "Mark's... Mark, Mark, Mark died." And I just screamed. I just screamed. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "You got to be kidding me! You got to be kidding me! "They're on stage right now. "They're supposed to be playing right now. "What are you talking about? This can't be true! "This isn't happening!" And like I just remember screaming. And I was like, "I don't understand. What's going on? What's going on?" I had to tell people immediately, because it was going to be all over the radio. [sighs deeply] And I just didn't want to do it, you know? And I had to. [Sabine] It was July 4th weekend. So we were going to Vinalhaven, which is a small island off the coast of Rockland, Maine. My biggest concern was telling Sabine, because I didn't want Sabine to hear about it any other way. She was on island with no way to be reached. They figured if they could get a message to people on a ferry that they could let me know that way. And we just got in the car and drove up to Maine to find her. [Sabine] There was a parade in town that morning. And that afternoon somebody rides up in a truck and gives my friend a telephone number. And they're telling me to call this number. And it's Deb Kline on the line, and I'm completely shocked because that's not what I expected. Just said, you know, "Sabine, it's Deb. "I have some really awful news. Mark's dead. "He died of a heart attack while he was playing in Italy." I remember just dropping the phone and walking away and going, "No, no, no." That's how I found out. The last... The last time I remember seeing him was he was hanging out the window, waving out the van. My wife wakes me up. I was napping in the middle of the day, and Lisa woke me up with the news that Mark has died. And our having a computer was still pretty new. So watching the news break on the Internet. Everything feels like sort of a fever dream. So we spent a couple of days in Palestrina before we could get a flight home. A couple of days in my room, pretty much. But there were a few times when I went out and sat with Billy and Dana. [speaking in Italian] The police were searching his room. They were looking for drugs. They were looking for clues. They were looking for anything. They were very invasive. Because they, of course, they were convinced a band with the name Morphine, this was drug related. Yeah, it was a massive heart attack. [Dana] And, unfortunately, a lot of people have come away with the belief that Mark was a junkie, or he died due to an overdose of heroin or something like that It couldn't be further from the truth. He wasn't a junkie. He was very interested in literature, Morpheus, dream worlds and God of sleep if, you know, that connotation was what we were about. As I'm packing up his stuff and it occurs to me that, what is this worth now? It's worth nothing without Mark, because he was what made those things important. It just became stuff. [Phil] I remember flying home sitting next to Billy and Billy saying, "You know, this is probably the last time "that we'll fly together in this setting." [speaking in Italian] His body had to be flown back via plane. And Deb and Billy and Dana and I went to the airport. And I just remember looking out the window and the cargo door was open. And we saw the coffin coming out. Yeah, my knees buckled and Billy was there. Oof! I also got back, of course, all of the stuff that he had. His suitcase, and I found rolls of film in there. And I saw pictures that he took. Is the view off the temple, and this is him. The first memorial concert we had was in Cambridge. All kinds of people came from all over the place to play at this memorial concert. Mark was now gone, and it forced everybody a little closer together. "Now some months passed, "Billy, Deb and myself are here "in lost angels land to do what? "Mark's passing has left many questions. "The Night plays in my hotel Bel Age CD player. "The bass is giving it a work out. Go Mark. "Looking back, moving forward, "an ongoing conversation "with my lost friend in the spiritual world. "The last time I was on plane "it was coming home from Italy after Mark died. "The last time I was in L.A. was with Mark. "The last time I was in this hotel was with Mark. "The life we lived out of suitcases. "Right about now we would gather in Mark's room "amidst the many hues of smoke. "And in between the marathon pacing "we would discuss, Billy, Mark and myself, "the direction we were heading, one offer at a time." [Dana] Both Billy and I were determined to carry the torch. And to keep the legacy alive and to keep the music alive. And to do what we could not to forget our fallen friend. And to celebrate his life and his music. It was just a big, empty, gaping hole that we tried to fill the best as we could. And I think we filled it with other people, you know? I think we brought together all of the musicians that knew and loved Mark, and we called it Orchestra Morphine. A nine piece band to perform the music from The Night, which was kind of a very highly orchestrated record comparatively to what we had done in the past. This music needed to be played live. It was a catharsis, you know, for us too. I remember looking out at shows and people would be crying. And I'd be like, yes, it's not easy for us either. The year we spent touring as Orchestra Morphine in support of The Night, heading over to Palestrina and doing that very same festival. The exact same stage, the same festival, the same drums. I remember when we got there we sort of walked passed it and looking down into the park. [Sabine] When I went back to Palestrina, they gave me the same room he had been in. So I got to, you know, be in that room, and I got to look out the window and see what he had seen and meet the people he was with and retrace his steps. Make some kind of sense out of it. And I saw pictures that he took. I had printed them out and put them in an album, and I just followed through where he had been. And then I took my own pictures, framing things he had seen. I definitely understood how that of all places where somebody could pass away and in all the ways that they could, that he was in this stunning town, full of people with so much heart. The mayor dedicated the steps leading up to the park where he died. And it was just this beautiful gesture. The ten year anniversary of Mark's death, the people from the festival asked Dana and Billy to put something together. [Dana] I really wanted to do a trio. I wanted to bring the music back to where it began, and the idea of having our good friend Jeremy Lyons join us. He took up the task and learned the songs. Billy couldn't make it to Italy, so we went as a trio. And Jerome Deupree on drums. I thought that show was empowering for a lot of people, especially for Dana. [Dana] We pulled it off, you know? We went back. We played Morphine songs, and we brought our families there. And it was an amazing celebration. I think that Morphine would still be doing like cool soundtrack stuff, making valid music, touring, and they would be appreciated. And who knows where the music would be now. You know that they're not done, yet. Life ends for them before they get to, you know, turn the corner and explore new possibilities. And I suppose people have said this, "I'd quite like to go on stage if I had to go." Yeah... In a way what could be sweeter if your time is up? Morphine was one of the first groups to come out and say, "What is this? Is this a rule book?" "No, it ain't no rule book. There are no rules." So they ripped that book up, that's why, for me, they were like deadly important. [Hamilton] I didn't listen to their music for maybe five years after Mark died. I didn't even try. Maybe once or twice it would come on, we'd be in a bar and I'd leave. For ten years I've had dreams about Sandman and Morphine. It's mostly the same thing. Mark is dead, but he doesn't know it. Billy and Dana and I are arguing over who's going to tell him he's dead. I'm doing the same thing I was doing when I was 21, painting houses and playing at bars at night. My heart is still in the same place. And what matters to me is my family and having a place to express myself. Everything I do in music has been influenced by Mark. I felt like for me to grow as a person and as a manager I needed to leave Boston and go where the business was situated, which is L.A., so... Then you move to Montana and you start an organic farm, and you start raising up vegetables... And, I mean, I'm literally living a lifestyle that is the antithesis. I get up at 5:00 in the morning, and I'm outside till it's dark at night, and, you know, music's finding a different place in my life. And I'm just kind of letting that naturally happen. This is a house in Woodstock, New York. And I first came to this town with Mark. When I was here with him, I never thought in a million years I'd end up living here in this house. We had planned a motorcycle riding trip through Africa, that was going to end in us climbing Mount Kilimanjaro on New Year's Eve, the winter of 2000. Mark was definitely onboard to go, which totally shocked me, and he didn't make it. But I just decided that I wanted to stay with the plan, so I went by myself. It's like a six day climb. It's very long. I'm not sure it was the altitude or not, but I got incredibly emotional. A part of what was driving and motivating me to make it to the top, was that Dana had given me a reed from his saxophone in which he had written something. And I had a stone that I had taken from his grave that I wanted to go up and leave these things there. To actually be on the roof of Africa when the sun dawned on a new millennium. And I closed my eyes and I just thought of him, and then I wished that he had been there with me to see it.
