Saint Seiya Heaven's Chapter Die, Seiya! You will die for defying the Gods! You managed to avoid our attacks? This is... Did you do this... Athena? Athena, stop! We have orders to kill him! No! He is just a human. He is not worthy of your protection. Who ordered you here? Your sister. She is worried about you. She ordered you to kill? He must be punished for defying the Gods. I will not forgive anyone who hurts Seiya. Only one person can make the world plunge into darkness in an instant The Goddess of Darkness. The moon is even brighter than the sun. This light only exists for Artemis. My little sister, Athena. Artemis. Sister... Athena, you have fallen from grace. Is this how a Goddess whose job is to guide the humans should act? You are unfit to rule the Earth realm anymore. You will hand over the Earth to me! Don't tell me now that you can bear to let it go. I feel that Athena has changed. She looks so holy, pure and dignified. Is this the real Athena? I just need to give you this staff, right? No hesitation at all. Does the Earth mean so little to Athena? But I have a request. Request? Please forgive the Saints for fighting against the Gods. I will atone for their sins, so please do not hurt the Saints and Seiya. I hope that they can fully live out their human lives. You want me to let them go? Athena do you know which is more important, this staff or their lives? Human lives are but an instant compared to the Gods. They can live but if they go against the Gods again, I will not forgive them. The Saints won't fight again. There is no need for that in this peaceful time. In the name of Athena. Come back with me to the Heavens. As a Goddess, you must do that. I understand. No... Saori... Gold Saints, you have lost your bodies. You only have your souls. But the Gods don't intend to forgive your sins. We are Athena's Saints. Even if we anger the Gods and have to die we will not hesitate. We live for Athena. As Athena's Gold Saints the highest of the Saints, you are only ordinary humans. We shall seal your souls. The price for defying the Gods will be that your souls for all eternity will not rest in peace. Your souls will remain trapped here forever! We live for Athena. Even if you trap us here forever we will not give up. If you seal our souls here, humans who inherit our will shall appear! Even so even if such people appear they cannot defeat the Gods. Humans can never surpass the Gods. Please do not destroy the humans. It is too late. Humans will disappear from this world very soon. If this is the Gods' will, I shall exchange my life for the humans. Little sister, we cannot expect much from humans. We are Gods after all. Saori. I cannot sense Athena. Are you okay, Seiya? Marin! Seiya, have you have come to? What happened to me? Marin, where is Athena? Seiya, I heard you lost consciousness after your fight with Hades and Athena tended to you herself. So you are now here. Marin, something must have happened to Saori. Isn't this like you, Seiya? Worrying about Athena, even if you are in such a weak state. Marin, it is not what you think. The world seems to be different... I have a bad feeling about this. Bad feeling? Marin. Bad. Maybe it is true. Marin, do you know what has happened? No. I am here to find out. Seiya go back to the Holy Realm. Shaina and the rest are there. Don't look like you are at a loss, got it? This is the Holy Realm? What has happened? This is the Holy Realm of Lord Artemis. Who? Seiya, you cannot come and go as you please here. Shaina, what are you talking about? Isn't this Athena's Holy Realm? It used to be I think but everything has changed now Seiya. What has changed? This is Athena's Holy Realm. Shaina, Athena. Saori where is she? Athena has handed the Earth to Lord Artemis. Seiya, you should know about that. Nonsense! Nikoshima Takeshi? Shaina, why? Seiya, you are not a Saint anymore. Please leave right now. What did you say? I never thought Seiya would be my first task after agreeing to serve Artemis. What a shock! Shoichi? Since we know each other if you swear to stay away from the realm I will save you this time. What are you talking about? We are Athena's Saints. No one here is Athena's Saint. I am! You sure don't look like one. What did you say? You are very annoying. Go back now! I can't exert any strength? My Cosmo. Where is my Cosmo? My Cosmo! Seiya, the Cosmo must come from the flames in your heart. Have you given up? You want me to lend you a mirror? Look at how pathetic you are. That is why Athena gave up on the Saints and the Earth. I am a Saint! Does the name, Saint mean so much to you? I thought so highly of you. It is not that! Seiya, the Earth doesn't need you anymore. No! This is too funny for words! This is so scary! Is he dead? You're so pathetic, so pitiful! You'd better run home now. And you better forget about Athena! How can I forget Athena! You can't? Then let me help you! Will this do? The order is to expel Seiya. You are right, Shaina. Let's go. Really. Seiya isn't the only fool. Has he come down yet? Shaina, Shoichi and Nikoshima Takeshi. This can't be true. Saori can't have abandoned the Earth. I can't see her anymore! This can't be true! This can't be true! This isn't real! How can I believe that! This is my Saint Cloth? My Saint Cloth is rejecting me? No, my body is rejecting the Saint Cloth. I cannot see Athena again. It is my fault. It is all because of me. I may not be able to stop it, but if I can delay it for this world. Take my blood. Why did it turn out like this? What? An enemy? A SkyWarrior? Who are you? Theseus, a SkyWarrior! The Gods' messenger? Where is Athena? What has happened to the world in Athena's charge? Do you know what is going on? How did it become like this? Lord Artemis has taken over the Earth. And I have orders to kill Athena's Saints. Where is Athena? Athena and her Saints have repeatedly defeated the Gods. The Gods are very angry, that's why they are to be killed. Even Athena has to die? Athena is dying! What did you do to Athena? She is offering her blood to save the humans. Once she is bled dry, she will... No! Brother, you're here? Brother, Athena and the souls of the Gold Saints... Shun, say no more! Athena deserted the Earth and is paying for her sins with her life. I don't know why Athena's Saints still have the nerve to defy the Gods. Athena didn't force us. We are Athena's Saints. The proof of that is not Athena or the Saint Cloth but the scars on our bodies. They have been carved on our bodies and they will never disappear. As Athena's Saint, I have to defeat you. Brother! A very strong fighting spirit. This is Athena's Saint? I understand why the Gods want Athena's Saints dead. I have to kill Athena's Saints now. I cannot let the Gods worry over this. Shun! I will protect you, Brother. No matter what you say, Ikki, I will never give up! Shun, don't be mistaken. I just want to fight alongside you as a Saint. Brother. Shun, did you sense that? The water is warm. Athena's water is warming us. Not only that. The Gold Saints are giving us their support too. Shun, can you feel it? This warmth is from everyone. Do you know why for each battle, our Cosmo can defeat our enemies every time? That is... we are not afraid to die but it doesn't mean we will give up. Brother! You are not afraid of the powers of the Gods? Nebula Chain! Nebula Stream! Houyoku Tenshou! We were right in putting Athena under your protection. You, who have inherited our will our fates have been decided. We will vanish from this world. But before that we hope that in this era you can try to leave behind some evidence of our existence in this world. Even the Gods cannot forbid it. We are proud of what we have done. Hyoga? Hyoga! Seiya don't come over! Shiyu? Why did you attack them? Because they're Athena's Saints. I am Athena's Saint too. Then we will attack you too! You are too slow! Athena will bleed to death soon and her Saints will disappear! What did you say? Athena will soon run out of blood. What did you do to Athena? Saori will die from loss of blood? I will not forgive you for this. So what? Once her blood has run out Athena will die. This can't be true! This can't be true! Athena is bleeding now to protect you. Saori's bleeding for us? No! I will make her stop! I will make her stop! You must learn to let things go. Pegasus Ryuseiken! Seiya, run! I won't stop here. If we do not do this who is going to protect Athena? Athena has given the Earth to Lord Artemis to manage. There is no Goddess for you to protect. Why are you still fighting? It does not matter! I will not give up! Is this what it means to be human? They are human Saints. They may have something the Gods have forgotten. How is it? Is it over? My Cosmo, burn! Seiya, I have remembered regardless the enemies we face to protect Athena, we will stand up and fight! Diamond Dust! Rozan Shoyuha! Hyoga! Shiyu! This how we have always fought. If we lose all our Saints we will move forward one step at a time and continue to move on. With such will we have created many miracles. Our bodies remember we fight along with Athena and the Saints. We fight to protect Athena! If you stand in my way then I will have to kill you. My Cosmo, burn! Humans need to be destroyed before a new start. So does Athena! In the past battles to protect Athena, my Cosmo learnt to burn. My Cosmo, who burns to protect Athena even if it will die. You and the Gods will never know. No, even if the Gods know they will never understand. Shiyu! I have almost forgotten this. You helped me remember, Seiya. As Athena's Saints we have defeated much stronger enemies. Athena. Hyoga! Shiyu, Hyoga, I will make the first move. You must catch up! Humans, you think you can beat me, Odysseus, a SkyWarrior? I must keep moving, I must not stop. I must keep on moving to Athena. My Cosmo is fading away! Shiyu and Hyoga risked their lives entrusting this task to me. But in my current state, I cannot protect Athena! Why did you defy the Gods? I am Icarus, Lord Artemis's SkyWarrior. You were with that guy just now? What did Artemis do to Athena? Athena is not a God now. She has deserted you, so you need not fight anymore. I do not care. I am Athena's Saint. Why do you believe in Athena so much? Athena isn't expecting you to come. I came not because she's waiting or she's a God. Whether she is a God or not, I believe in Saori. Believe in Athena. That belief alone helps you defeat all your enemies? Yes, to protect Athena, I will go on fighting. I chose to stay with a God who has absolute power. No, I hope to be that. That is why I became stronger. Seiya of Pegasus, how are you able to beat such a God? How can you do that? How do I know? I just fight to protect Athena. The SkyWarriors have been defeated by the Saints. Your Cosmo is gone. I cannot feel you have any power to defeat a God. Seiya of Pegasus, you intend to fight a God with that body? I will not allow that. This is your Cosmo after burning? I was looking forward to fighting you. I looked forward to you, who stood with Athena and defeated Gods. I was looking forward to doing battle with you, Seiya of Pegasus! Now I only want to kill you! Seiya of Pegasus, die! Who are you? I am looking for the owner of this bell. Do you know? Is the bell yours? Woman, your Cosmo is annoying me. I am not a human! Even so, I still want to know about the bell. I have always wanted to see him. I have never stopped missing him. After I saw this bell I came here. Humans are weak because they have feelings. I do not have those things now. Is that so? Humans can become stronger because of the sadness of separation, the grief of not seeing the other person. He may suffer but if he believes in something he will grow stronger. Seiya has gone through his life that way. This is definitely not weakness! Forget about finding the owner of this bell. My parents and my sister only live in my memories. There is no way I can find them. I can only live alone. So I became someone who is unaffected by emotions and everything around me. I do not need any human emotions or blood ties. Like Lord Artemis said. Don't you dare hurt Marin. You want to protect this woman? Seiya, don't worry about me! I want to protect Marin. Seiya will catch up with Athena. Then you may not be able to beat him. I am not who I once was. Sister, let me protect you! If I become a God. I am not wrong. Feelings will fade with time and thinking will change. Lord Artemis. Icarus, do you miss the Earth? The SkyWarriors have been defeated by humans. I know. Why are they defeated by such weak humans? Do those Saints have some power that we do not have? Even so, you are different. I am different? You raised my interest. I don't mean that in a bad way. You must know, you are the only human I have chosen. Icarus, I hope to hear about your future victory. If I can beat Seiya of Pegasus, everything will be over. If I can beat Seiya of Pegasus, who has the power to defeat Gods. That's right. We will put an end to everything right before Athena's eyes. Before Athena's eyes. My body is refusing to move forward. How can I give up like this! Even if it is only half a step I must move on! Saori is waiting for me. I am Athena's Saint. Lord Artemis is looking forward to the miracles brought about by humans. Athena's Saints will only move under the orders of their Goddess. Me too! What am I thinking? I agreed to serve Lord Artemis. I just need to focus on defeating that boy who can defeat Gods. Then I will become a God! Even if I have to make enemies with all the Gods in the universe. As long as it is for Athena, I will sacrifice my life! Prove it to me that this feeling is real. Show me the side that is not afraid of the Gods. I just want to go to Athena. That is all I want. Have you upgraded your Cosmo? Before I reach Saori, I can upgrade my Cosmo unlimited times. If you try to stop me, I will defeat you. If you want to get to Athena, then show me your power and fight me! You are too slow! Is that all you can do? This is your Cosmo whom burns to protect Athena? Why don't you try ignoring that and burn the Cosmo? Then I will do it without you telling me. If I don't defeat you, I won't be able to see Saori. Icarus, I will defeat you. Pegasus, you can't defeat me in your current state. Let me send you to Athena. I want you to helplessly watch while Athena bleeds to death! Saori! Saori, please stop that. I can't stand to see you hurt. And... Saori, you don't need to do that. We are here. Seiya? Yes, it is me. It is okay now. All those injuries... You are really... What are you saying? Now that I see you, Saori, these injuries are nothing. I am not the Goddess of the Earth anymore. You should be freed from your terrible fate as a Saint. No matter what happens, I live for you, Saori even if I have to stand against the whole world. Even if my opponent is a God, I won't lose myself. Seiya thank you. You really made it here. Seiya, I want to kill you! Saori what are you talking about? I said, I want to kill you! This can't be true. Saori what's wrong with you? Sister please lend me your staff again. I want to kill Seiya! You have finally regained your senses as a God. Athena kill Seiya and come back with me! Can this be true? Saori, you really want to kill me? Yes! Really? Seiya are you ready? Didn't I say so before? I live only for you, Saori. So I can die for you too! Seiya... Brother, Seiya's Cosmo... Forget about Seiya. We have to get to Athena fast. Hyoga, what are you doing? Hurry! Don't you know what's happening? Seiya's Cosmo is fading. I know. That is why we have to go to Athena quickly. We are Athena's Saints. We must hurry! Seiya... What is wrong with you, Shaina? Seiya should have given up on coming here by now? Yes, he should have. Making him give up was the right thing. Let's go. No one will come here again. Shaina, wait! Shaina! Are humans only guards of the Gods? Humans may have made many mistakes. Maybe they truly deserve to be wiped out. In troubled times or in grief they still love each other. Sometimes they may achieve a higher existence. I have always believed that. Even for an moment I would rather believe in these great sentiments now. I am so sorry. Seiya... I have dragged you into another battle. Please forgive me. Saori, what are you talking about? I don't fight because of your words. I just want to fight for you. Seiya... Athena's staff only destroyed the powers left behind by Hades. Athena, is this your answer? I just hope that Seiya can live on as an ordinary human. But that is only my heart talking. Seiya, you fight not because you are the guard of a God. It is only a human doing what he wants to do while he is still alive. That is why I fight for Saori. Athena, why aren't you coming back to us? I am Athena. My heart is with the humans. Then you shall perish with the humans. The Cosmo in my body is burning. Humans cannot beat Gods. Athena, do you know what I am feeling now? You are my sister and yet I have to kill you! I have already defied the Gods. Since that is the case I may have to fight you! Fight me? I am the Goddess of the Earth. For the living if it is necessary. Athena! I have found something more important than the powers of a God. Such a thing does not exist! Is it over? Have you ever wondered? Why do the Gods have eternal life and powers beyond imagination? These powers may not be for ourselves but for exterminating those who are not Gods? The Gods may be the guardians of the living. Gods will only be Gods! Humans are an accidental creation of the Gods! Watch! In an instant you will understand everything. Aren't you afraid of getting hurt or dying? Why should I be? The best thing about humans are memories and the links between lives. Pegasus Ryuseiken! You cannot kill me! I really hate the sound of the bell my sister gave me. It means nothing but I want to shed my human heart and become a God. But that bell makes me recall things about my sister. I want to throw away my memories but why... When I saw the bell I was already sure that I would find you. I have always thought, I can go back to you one day and protect you! Hakaruma... That is why I want to be stronger, why I chose to forget about you and started on my journey to be a God. I took too long to find you, it is my fault. It is my fault, you are so lonely and unable to understand human love. Humans can become stronger when they think of someone. Then the Cosmo will be able to burn without limits. This is what I thought after I saw Athena and Pegasus. I have forgotten how to remember the others. I can never win. Forgotten how to remember the others. Athena. Are you serious? The main difference between us, Sister is I believe in the human heart. Believing in the human heart has made me stronger. Saori. Perish now! You are no longer a God. Hakaruma! Hakaruma, why did you do this? I don't know. My body just moved by itself. Icarus! Maybe this is human instinct? Lord Artemis, you can't kill Athena! It doesn't become you to have blood on your hands. It doesn't. Hakaruma! I don't know what the Gods think of this world I really don't know. The Gods... the Gods they are... Seiya... What are they? What are the Gods? This voice? Brother! What are the Gods? No human can know the answer. That is a forbidden question. Artemis. I thought you were wiser than that. Athena, let me take a look at you. Come on. Saori. Very pretty. It is almost a pity to make you disappear! My little Sister, humans who get close to Gods are not tolerated. What a strange species. You actually dare to hit a God! Whether we are fighting Poseidon or Hades, Saori always believes in us. She is willing to risk her life to believe in me. Seiya, no! Against Apollo our powers are lacking. I learned something from Marin. That is to never run away when facing my enemies. The Gods are eternal. Even so you still want to defy us? Things that last are the most beautiful in this world. Human, you are going to be destroyed soon! I also have something that lasts. The Cosmo explosion gave us powers. At that time we Saints can become one with the Cosmo and become the closest being to all eternity. Seiya! Are the Gods really that great? To the Gods are the humans really so insignificant? But humans have been trying very hard to survive. What kind of Gods are you, if you don't protect these people? Aren't the Gods supposed to forgive humans and bring them warmth? Saori lives together with us. She believes in us. What kind of God do you call yourself, if you don't love the people? I don't need this kind of God. You are tying to deny the Gods? That is impossible! Stop it, please! Athena. If this goes on I am afraid you will get hurt Brother! What did you say? If you want to fight then let me be your opponent. What did you say? Saori, you cannot do it. Even if humans are foolish, even if we will be destroyed in the end, just one punch I am going to punch Him in the face to prove that humans exist in this world! My Cosmo burn to the limits! Perish now, human! When a human's spirit surpasses a God, will the Gods allow that? What punishment will they give? I am sorry. It is really beautiful here. I don't know why but it gives me a sense of deja vu. But this is the first time I have been here. It is okay. I am the only one here. I hope you find the person you are looking for!
