UNTIL NOW. SHIT! HI, MOM. I KNOW. I'M SORRY. I JUST GOT IN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. IT'S ENTIRELY DIFFERENT HERE NOW. THERE'S A McDONALD'S NEXT TO THE HOTEL. THAT WAS 35 YEARS AGO. DADDY WAS A SOLDIER. IT WAS A WAR. I'M WORKING. IT'S NOT CALLED SAIGON ANYMORE. INVESTIGATING SIGHTINGS OF P.O.W.s AND M.I.A.s. STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME. I'M A BIG GIRL. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. MAN... I LIKE THIS ROOM. YEAH YEAH. IT'S VERY "APOCALYPSE NOW." WHO ARE YOU? HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE? OH, IT'S COOL. RELAX, MAN, IT'S COOL. WHOA, WE'RE NOT GETTING OFF TO A VERY GOOD START HERE, HUH? LOOK, I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. JESUS, I DON'T WANT YOUR GODDAMN MONEY. WHAT DO YOU WANT? PEACE ON EARTH, COMFORTABLE SHOES. COME ON, COME ON. SIT DOWN. COME ON. YOU'RE AMERICAN, AREN'T YOU? WHY DON'T YOU JUST POUR US A COUPLE OF DRINKS? IT'S NOT EVEN NOON. IT'S COCKTAIL HOUR STATESIDE. POUR THE DRINKS. YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED ME. What are you doing here? That a pretty broad question, you know, one of those... COSMIC QUESTIONS, LIKE "WHAT ARE ANY OF US DOING HERE?" I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT MY ROOM. DID YOU GET MY LETTER? I GOT A LETTER. IT WAS ANONYMOUS. HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE THE MAN I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET? THAT'S GOOD THINKING. THAT'S GOOD THINKING. I MEAN, LIKE, HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WHO YOU ARE? I MEAN, LET'S SEE SOME I.D. COME ON. THAT'S MY YOUNGEST. RUBY. HOW OLD? 19. 19, AH... AIN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE, HUH? LOOK, MAN, I-- I HAD A LONG TRIP AND I'M TIRED. YOU WANNA STATE YOUR BUSINESS AND GET ON WITH IT? YOU'RE ONE CURIOUS CAT, PARSON. I MEAN, YOU GET THIS ANONYMOUS LETTER FROM SOMEBODY IN VIETNAM AND YOU JUST HOP ON A PLANE AND-- WHOOSH-- HERE YOU ARE. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE-- IT'S KIND OF AN EXPENSIVE TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE FOR A MAN OF THE CLOTH. I MEAN, HAVE YOU BEEN DIPPING INTO THE COLLECTION BOX? YOU BEEN SKIMMING THE BINGO? THE WRITER SAID HE WAS A P.O.W. LEFT BEHIND. I KNOW THIS ORGANIZATION IN WASHINGTON THAT DEALS WITH THINGS LIKE THAT-- M.I.A.s, SURVIVORS AND SUCH. THEY TOLD ME IF I WENT BACK TO 'NAM AND CHECKED IT OUT THEY WOULD COVER MY EXPENSES. SO I FIGURED I COULD SEE SOME PEOPLE, TIE UP SOME LOOSE ENDS. "LOOSE ENDS." MAI LING, IS SHE A LOOSE END? HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? YOUR DAUGHTER, DOES SHE KNOW SHE'S GOT HERSELF A 30-YEAR-OLD BROTHER? THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. MAYBE. MAYBE NOT. I MEAN, MAYBE-- MAYBE THEM GOOD PARISHIONERS THAT VOTED YOUR ASS INTO CITY COUNCIL, MAYBE THEY'D TAKE EXCEPTION TO YOU ABANDONING YOUR HALF-GOOK SON. YOU DON'T KNOW MY CONSTITUENCY. LOOK, MAN, YOU THINK YOU CAN SHAKE ME DOWN FOR SOME CHICK I'D KNOCKED UP 30 YEARS AGO? WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY? HMM. YEAH, MAYBE. MAYBE. But am I any crazier than you? - SHE'S HERE. - I still can't believe you just jumped on an airplane. DENIS? HI, I'M SARA REID, VIETNAM-- VIETNAM VETERANS ACTION COMMITTEE. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY HIM? NO, WE HAVEN'T MADE A VISUAL YET. IT'S FINALLY NICE TO MEET YOU IN PERSON. OH, UH... MacDONALD, COOPER. THEY'RE IN FROM WASHINGTON. - THEY'RE HERE TO GIVE A HELPING HAND. - HI. IT'S JUST ANOTHER CRANK. WASTE OF TIME, IF YOU ASK ME. SO WHAT DO WE DO? WE WAIT, SEE WHAT HAPPENS, TRY TO IDENTIFY HIM. WE SHOULD JUST GRAB HIM NOW, SORT IT OUT LATER. WE GO NOW, WE GOT NOTHING. BETTER LET IT PLAY OUT. So are we just going to sit here? Why, you got somewhere better to be? THERE HE IS. MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK? DOES YOUR ORGANIZATION GET MANY LEADS OF ALLEGED SURVIVORS? UM, NO, NOT SINCE NORMALIZATION. NO, MOST ARE FAKES... SCAMMERS SEARCHING FOR BENEFITS OR OFFERING TO FIND M.I.A.s FOR A FEE. I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME CHECKING UP ON THE FAMILIES, VERIFYING RECORDS, THAT KIND OF THING. IT'S BEEN 30 YEARS. THERE ARE NO SURVIVORS. I GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN WASTE MY TIME LOOKING FOR GHOSTS. JUST KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE WINDOW, OKAY? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS IS ANY DIFFERENT? WELL, IT'S THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE LETTER-- THE THREATS OF RETALIATION-- BUT NO ONE AT STATE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THAT'S WHY I CONTACTED JPAC IN HONOLULU AFTER MEETING RAY. THEY PUT ME ONTO YOU AT DET TWO. LOOK, AND I AM HAPPY TO HELP, BUT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP. ALL WE DO IS INVESTIGATE CLAIMS LIKE THIS, AND NOTHING'S EVER PANNED OUT. SO WHAT NOW? RAY, IT'S YOUR EYES-- SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT. THEY'RE JUST NOT INTENSE LIKE THEY USED TO BE, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW ME? OH, YEAH-- WELL, I KNEW YOU. NOT IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE. WE WERE IN SOME SHIT TOGETHER. OKAY, WE-- WE SERVED TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S YOUR NAME? I-- I KNOW I AIN'T NO SPRING CHICKEN, BUT SOME THINGS SHOULDN'T BE FORGOTTEN. SOME PEOPLE SHOULDN'T BE FORGOTTEN. LIKE RAMSEY, CAPTAIN RAMSEY, HUH? HE WAS ALWAYS A GOOD SOLDIER. GO ALL THE WAY! COME ON, COME ON, LET'S GO! COME ON! COME ON, LET'S MOVE! YEAH! EAT THAT! HEY, CAPTAIN, YOU WANT TO COME BACK OUT? WE NEED ANOTHER GUY. NO, I GOTTA-- I GOTTA FINISH THIS. WHO ARE YOU WRITING TO? YOUR WIFE? UM, NO. I'M WRITING A CONDOLENCE LETTER TO LIEUTENANT FOX'S, UH-- ARE HIS PARENTS STILL ALIVE? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. - HAS HE GOT A WIFE? - I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU KNOW HIS FIRST NAME OR WHERE HE'S FROM? NO, YOU KNOW, HE JUST GOT HERE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. WE KNOW SHIT ABOUT HIM. HE'S JUST ANOTHER F.N.G. - F.N.G.? - FUCKING NEW GUY. LOOK, WE'LL BE-- WE'RE GONNA BE OUT THERE IF YOU NEED ANYBODY. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I REMEMBER HE MENTIONED HIS DOG, REX. REX. "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, I WAS LIEUTENANT FOX'S COMMANDING OFFICER. I REGRET HAVING TO WRITE THIS LETTER MORE THAN ANYTHING I CAN POSSIBLY EVER IMAGINE..." A RAMSEY LETTER HOME. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO GET ONE? HEY, DID ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY EVER GET ONE OF THOSE LETTERS? I MEAN, ANYBODY? ALL RIGHT, WE WERE IN THE SAME UNIT. I DON'T REMEMBER YOU. I'M SORRY. MY MOTHER DID. MY MOTHER GOT TO READ ONE OF THEM LETTERS. HUH. YOU KNOW... I USED TO WONDER HOW SHE TOOK IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN THEY TOLD HER I WAS DEAD OR MISSING, OR WHATEVER GODDAMN LIE THEY TELL. MY FATHER NEVER HAD ANY USE FOR ME, BUT MY MOTHER... ARE YOUR FOLKS STILL ALIVE? NO. THEY PASSED A WHILE AGO. YOU KNOW, WHAT DID THEY PUT IN THAT BOX THAT MY MOTHER BURIED ME IN? IS YOUR MOTHER STILL ALIVE? DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? I'M OKAY. EXACTLY HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL HER THAT, RAY? RAY, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL HER, UH-- "EXCUSE ME, MOTHER, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO WRITE"? IT'S 30 YEARS. IT'S 30 FUCKING YEARS! NO NO NO. I'M DEAD. I'M THINKING WE'RE ALL BETTER OFF FOR IT, - YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST-- - SHE'D WANNA KNOW. SHE'D WANNA KNOW THAT YOU'RE ALIVE. THAT WAS HER SONG. IT WAS HER LULLABY TO ME WHEN I WAS A BABY. UH... YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE MY ONLY SUNSHINE YOU MAKE ME HAPPY WHEN SKIES ARE GRAY... - THE SKY-- THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE YOU'LL BE GOING. - YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE - IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SKY, JAMES. - MY ONLY SUNSHINE... FATHER... JAMES, LOOK UP. LOOK UP, LOOK UP. ...YOU MAKE ME HAPPY - HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL. - WHEN SKIES ARE GRAY YOU GIVE ME HOPE... ...THE OTHER NIGHT, DEAR AS I LAY SLEEPING I DREAMT I HELD YOU IN MY ARMS... DOC? OKAY... MARK JORDAN, NAVY CORPSMAN, 1st RECON BATTALION, KILLED IN ACTION JANUARY 10, 1971. OR NOT. HIS BODY WAS NEVER RECOVERED. RAY, WHO WAS HIS SQUAD LEADER, REPORTED HIM DEAD. DO YOU HAVE THAT PHOTO? COMIN' AT YOU. WHAT DO YOU THINK? MIGHT BE. PROBABLY NOT. I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S SOMETHING... I HAVE A FEELING. GUESS THAT SETTLES IT, HUH? YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME, AGENT MacDONALD? RELAX. JUST FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT THIS GUY, OKAY? IT'S HIM. IT'S HIM. DOC, THEY SAID YOU WERE DEAD. FOR 30 YEARS-- OH, FOR 30 YEARS-- OH MY GOD, DOC! DON'T! DON'T YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME!

FUCK, THEY'RE ALL WOMEN, MAN! OH, MAN, OH. FUCK! - THEY'RE ALL WOMEN, MAN. - GOD DAMN IT! THEY WERE LITTLE GIRLS, RAY, JUST LITTLE GIRLS. THEY WERE KILLING US, DOC! YEAH, AND WE DID WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO, RIGHT? WE JUST DID WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. DOC, IS THERE A REASON... why you're pointing that gun in my face? HE HAS A WEAPON? - IT'S UNDER CONTROL. - IT IS? LET ME DO MY JOB. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON... HEY, SARGE, TRUST ME NOW? DO YOU TRUST ME NOW, SARGE, HUH? I ONLY TRUST IN THE LORD, DOC. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS WAS GONNA TAKE, SO I ORDERED US LUNCH. IT'S OPEN. COME ON IN. OH, HERE, PUT IT HERE. DO I KNOW YOU? YOU EVER WORK AT THE HANOI HILTON? NO, SIR. I HEARD IT WAS QUITE THE PLACE. THERE IS A PACKAGE FOR YOU AT THE FRONT DESK, SIR. IT REQUIRES YOUR SIGNATURE. BRING IT UP. NO, SIR. YOU MUST COME DOWN TO SIGN FOR IT. IT'S OKAY. I'LL GET IT LATER. ARE YOU CERTAIN, SIR? YEAH, IT'LL BE FINE. TIP'S INCLUDED. THANK YOU. THEY TRY THEIR BEST. I KNOW IT'S NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS YOU'RE PROBABLY USED TO BACK IN THE STATES, BUT THEY'VE COME A LONG WAY. YOU OKAY WITH CHOPSTICKS? I'LL MANAGE. THAT'S A NICE TOUCH, RAY. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON OVER THERE? IT SEEMS TO BE UNDER CONTROL. I GAVE THE REVEREND A WAY OUT, BUT HE PASSED. THE TARGET'S GOT A PISTOL. THE FRONT DOOR IS THE ONLY WAY IN. "TARGET"? HOW DID YOU GET IN THERE? SARA-- WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE? WHITE MALE, 50s. THAT HIM? COULD BE. YOU ALL LOOK ALIKE TO ME. THAT'S FUNNY. YEAH, THAT'S HIM. NO DOUBT. DENIS, WHO ARE THESE GUYS? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW, SARA? THEY'RE C.I.A., AREN'T THEY? - AND YOU? - I'M WITH JPAC, DET TWO IN HANOI. YOU KNOW THAT. ARE YOU C.I.A. OR NOT? THEY GOT A FRIED CHICKEN PLACE DOWN THE BLOCK, IF YOU-- WE COULD SEND THAT PORTER OR-- THE FOOD'S FINE. YOU KNOW, IT TOOK ME ALMOST A YEAR TO GET USED TO MY FOOD NOT TASTING LIKE SOMEBODY PISSED IN IT. HOW LONG? SIX YEARS... FOUR MONTHS, 17 DAYS. BUT NOW I'M OFFICIALLY MISSING IN ACTION. HOW DID YOU ESCAPE? I DIDN'T. I WOKE UP ONE MORNING AND THE GUARDS, THE N.V.A., THEY JUST PACKED UP AND LEFT. GUESS WE'D LOST OUR VALUE. Were there others with you? - Mmm-hmm, a few. - I KNEW IT. - What happened to them? TRIED TO GET BACK, I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW. DIDN'T YOU EVEN TRY? THERE'S NO GOING BACK FOR ME, SARGE. I MEAN... I GOT THIS LIVING-IN-THE-NOW THING HAPPENING FOR ME, YOU KNOW? IT'S DONE ME PRETTY GOOD. IT'S GOTTEN ME THIS FAR. HOW DO YOU LIKE EATING RAT? NO, I'M JUST KIDDING. IT'S DOG. NO, IT'S PROBABLY GOAT. I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY, DOC. NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE JUST LIKE ALL THE REST. YOU JUST CARE ABOUT COVERING YOUR OWN ASS. YOU GONNA ANSWER THAT? HELLO. HI, HONEY. HOW ARE YOU AND THE GIRLS? - Ray... I'M WITH SOME PEOPLE. WE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON, YOU UNDERSTAND? OH, I KNOW. Do you need help? We could be there in a heartbeat. OH IT'S-- IT'S FINE. UM... THE PLACE HAS CHANGED A LOT. THEY EVEN HAVE A FRIED CHICKEN JOINT. Can you get him to talk more about the others? I'LL TRY. LISTEN, SWEETHEART, I-- I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING. I'LL CALL YOU BACK LATER, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. BYE. THAT'S MY WIFE. SHE WORRIES. ABOUT WHAT? AIN'T YOU A MAN OF THE CLOTH, SARGE? DON'T SHE TRUST YOU? THIS IS A STATE DEPARTMENT MATTER. YOU'RE NOT TO GET DIRECTLY INVOLVED. THERE MAY BE MORE M.I.A.s OUT THERE-- ALIVE, WAITING STILL. YOU'RE NOT BELIEVING ANY OF THIS, ARE YOU? I DON'T KNOW YET. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND OUT, ISN'T IT? THESE CLAIMS ARE UNSUBSTANTIATED, SARA. FORMER P.O.W.s ROAMING AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE-- IT'S BEEN RUMORED ALL THE TIME. NOT ONE HAS BEEN TRUE, EVER. RI-- UNTIL NOW. WHERE HAS DOC BEEN FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS? WHAT HAS HE BEEN DOING? DID HE TRY TO CONTACT US AND NEITHER GOVERNMENT KNEW? OR DID THEY? WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS DOC IS FOR REAL. LOOK, THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE IN VIETNAM, AND BOTH GOVERNMENTS WANT IT TO HAPPEN, BUT NEITHER SIDE IS GOING TO LET SOME LONE CRACKPOT TURN THE WHOLE THING UPSIDE DOWN WITHOUT ANY PROOF. RIGHT. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, RIGHT-- EXPENSIVE RUNNING SHOES AND CHEAP CELL PHONES? NO, IT'S ABOUT THE TRUTH, SARA. YOU'RE JUST BLINDED BY HOPE. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER P.O.W. SCAM. MAYBE. BUT WHO'S SCAMMING WHO? WHAT KIND OF HOLY MAN ARE YOU? I'M A MINISTER. I HAVE A SMALL CONGREGATION IN LOS ANGELES-- "LIGHT OF LOVE MISSION." AND YOU SIT ON THE CITY COUNCIL, AND IF THAT NEWSPAPER CLIPPING CAN BE TRUSTED THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO PUT YOUR ASS IN CONGRESS. WELL, AT LEAST GOD DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE. HIS ARMS ARE WIDE, DOC. WHERE DOES HE FIT IN YOUR LIFE? HE DOESN'T. GOD IS LOVE, DOC. AND HIS LOVE HAS SUSTAINED YOU.

SKIPPER, HOW MUCH AMMO WE GOT? - HANG ON. - COME ON, BUDDY. - HE'S LOSING BLOOD! - IT'S ALL RIGHT... - HANG ON, BUDDY! - SQUEEZE THE BLOOD! HOLD THAT THERE. HOLD THE BLOOD, ALL RIGHT? KEEP IT COMING. COME ON. - COME ON! - ALMOST THERE! HANG ON! PULL IT DOWN! PRESS IT, PRESS IT! I GOT HIM. JUST KEEP THE BLOOD FLOWING! I DON'T WANT TO DIE! I DON'T WANT TO DIE! - IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. HANG ON! - HE'S FINE, HE'S FINE. HE'S STABLE. HE'S GONNA MAKE IT. HE'S GONNA MAKE IT. "HE'S GONNA MAKE IT." THAT'S WHAT YOU KEPT SAYING. AND HE DID... YOU GOT ANY PLANS FOR WHEN WE GET BACK IN THE REAL WORLD? YEAH! I AIN'T GOING TO A FUCKING BEACH! ...WE ALL DID. BRAZINSKI MUST HAVE CALLED IN SOME FAVORS THAT DAY. - LET'S GO! - THAT CHOPPER ARRIVED LIKE AN ANGEL STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN. BUT I KNEW EVEN A MAN OF THE CLOTH HAS ONLY SO MANY FAVORS. YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE? TO PROVE TO MYSELF THAT DESPITE MAN'S INHUMANITY TO MAN ON THE BATTLEFIELD... THAT GOD STILL LIVES. CAN YOU FEEL HIS PRESENCE? CAN'T SAY THAT I DO. WE COMMEND OUR BROTHER TO THE LORD. LET US PRAY FOR OUR BROTHER. LET US PRAY FOR OUR BROTHER TO THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, WHO SAID, "I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. THE MAN WHO BELIEVES IN ME WILL LIVE EVEN IF HE DIES." LORD, HEAR OUR PRAYER. LET OUR FAITH BE OUR CONSOLATION, AND ETERNAL LIFE OUR HOPE. AMEN. AMEN. AMAZING GRACE HOW SWEET THE SOUND... I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE MARINE WE BURIED THAT DAY. - ...THAT SAVED A WRETCH... - MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO REMEMBER. ...LIKE ME I ONCE WAS LOST BUT NOW I'M FOUND WAS BLIND BUT NOW I SEE... WATER. DRINKS FOR THE POOR? - KOOL-AID! - HEY, THANKS, PADRE. - THANKS. - THANKS, FATHER. CHERRY? AHH! THEM HALAZONE TABLETS MAKE THIS WATER LIKE TIGER PISS. THIS IS GREAT! - HEY, FATHER, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? - OF COURSE. WHY ARE YOU HERE? FOR THE LORD IS EVERYWHERE, AND I'M JUST ONE OF HIS HUMBLE SERVANTS. EH. ACTUALLY I FEEL MORE SAFE HERE THAN I DO ON THE STREETS IN THE BRONX. I DON'T KNOW. HEY, I PUT YOU UP FOR A BRONZE STAR FOR SAVING DOC'S LIFE. IT CAME THROUGH YESTERDAY. CONGRATULATIONS. HARDCORE, FATHER, HARDCORE! - PADRE! - YOU DESERVE IT, FATHER. CONGRATULATIONS! CONGRATULATIONS, FATHER. THANKS AGAIN, KOOL-AID MAN. I'M NOT SURE I KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THAT... ...CAPTAIN. HEY... IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SILVER STAR. I COULDN'T WRITE UP THAT GRENADE TOSS, PADRE. IT WOULDN'T LOOK TOO COOL, MAN OF THE CLOTH AND ALL. I TOOK LIVES TO SAVE LIVES, CAPTAIN. I'M NOT SURE I KNOW HOW TO REJOICE TO THAT. I MUST BE OF GOOD COURAGE... AND THE LORD WILL STRENGTHEN MY HEART. HE WAS A PIECE OF WORK. HE SAVED YOUR LIFE. PROLONGED MY LIFE. NO, DON'T SAY THAT. WHERE THERE'S LIFE, DOC... THERE'S HOPE. OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW. DOC, I-- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH. YOU HAVEN'T A FUCKING CLUE WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'VE FUCKING BEEN THROUGH. YOU STILL THINK DOC'S A FRAUD, DENIS? NO ONE WAS LEFT BEHIND. IF THEY WERE ALIVE IN '72, THEY CAME HOME. END OF STORY. 591 OF THEM. BUT THERE WERE OVER 1000 PRISONERS JUST BEFORE HOMECOMING, SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE REST? SO WHAT CONSPIRACY THEORY DO YOU BUY, SARA-- THE ONE WHERE THE M.I.A.s WERE WHISKED AWAY TO SOME SECRET ISLAND OR THE ONE WHERE WE GAVE THEM NEW IDENTITIES JUST LIKE THEY DO IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM? FINE. THOSE STORIES ARE LUDICROUS, BUT THIS ONE LOOKS TRUE, AND THAT MEANS THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS. LIKE YOUR FATHER? MY FATHER? POOR LITTLE RICH GIRL LOSES HER DADDY IN THE WAR AND SPENDS HER ENTIRE ADULT LIFE TRYING TO PROVE THAT HE'S ALIVE. IT'S A FAIRY TALE, SARA, BUT WITHOUT THE HAPPY ENDING. THIS DOC IS A FRAUD. THERE'S NO TOOTH FAIRY, THERE'S NO SANTA CLAUS, AND YOUR DADDY DIED IN COMBAT WHEN YOU WERE 18 MONTHS OLD. MAI LING, DID SHE GET OLD LIKE US? DOC, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM? WHY DID YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK TO 'NAM? NOW THAT'S AVOIDANCE. SEE, I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT AVOIDANCE. I ASKED A QUESTION, YOU ANSWERED ME WITH A QUESTION. SO I'M-- I'M TAKING IT THAT THE REUNION WASN'T VERY HAPPY. SHE HAS HER REASONS. HOW LONG YOU AND MRS. RAY BEEN MARRIED? 35 YEARS. RIGHT BEFORE I SHIPPED OUT. SO THAT MEANS THAT MAI LING WAS WHAT, A LITTLE TRIM ON THE SIDE, HUH? THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, DOC. I'VE SEEN YOUR SON, SARGE. HE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU. OF COURSE, EXCEPT FOR THAT VIETNAMESE THING HE'S GOT GOING ON. YOU AND HIM, DID YOU MAKE PLANS TO GO TO A BALL-GAME, DISNEYLAND TOGETHER? I FEEL BAD ABOUT RYAN. I FEEL BAD ABOUT MAI LING... BUT THEY SEEM TO BE OKAY, THOUGH. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO THE HALF-BREEDS AFTER THE WAR, HUH? TREATED THEM LIKE SLAVES.. ESPECIALLY THE HALF-BLACK ONES. THEY'D SPIT ON THEM, BEAT THEM. LOCK THEIR MOTHERS UP IN PRISON FOR BEING COLLABORATORS AND WHORES. DID YOU LOVE MAI LING? I DON'T REMEMBER. YOU DON'T REMEMBER. I DON'T REMEMBER. SARGE, DO YOU REMEMBER WHO YOU WERE? PISS-WARM BEER, HUMIDITY... ...BUFFALO SHIT, AND SOME GOOD OLD MARY JANE. CAN YOU LIKE IT BETTER THAN THAT? MMM. SARGE, YOU ROLL IT TOO TIGHT. GIVE ME THAT DAMN THING. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, GIVE IT TO A MAN. HERE YOU GO. YOU GOT THAT? YEAH, I LIGHT IT, I'M GONNA GET IT. YEAH, I GOT IT. SOMEDAY THESE-- THESE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD-- HEY, EASY, SARGE. WARM PISS. - YEP. - PASS THE SHIT OVER HERE NOW. GOOD? WANNA KNOW THE BEST THING ABOUT REEFER, ABOUT JOINTS IN PARTICULAR? THEY GOT TWIN SISTERS. SMOKE THE MOTHERFUCKER, BITCH! BUFFALO PISS IN THE MORNING. SO I GOT HIGH. SO I GOT DRUNK. I SCREWED AROUND. I WAS WRONG, DOC. BUT THINGS CHANGE. PEOPLE CHANGE. TELL THAT TO RYAN'S MOTHER. I DID. AT LEAST I TRIED. SO WE ALL GET TO GO HOME AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. WELL, THAT'S ALL ANY ONE OF US EVER REALLY WANTED. LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT! YEAH, GET SOME! GET SOME! - GET SOME, MAN! WHOO! - WHOO! - IT'S TIME! - WHEW! DOC! - DOC, IT IS TIME TO BUST YOUR CHERRY! GET YOUR CHERRY POPPED, CHERRY! OKAY, YEAH! YEAH! COME ON, MAN. COME ON! - WHOO! WHOO! - HOW MUCH? I GOT 100,000 HE JUST AIR BURSTS! - HOW MUCH ON YOU GUYS? - WHO'S GOT A WATCH? - WHO'S GOT A WATCH ON? - WHO'S GOT THE GODDAMN WATCH? - I'VE GOT THE WATCH! - OKAY, TIME HIM. - TIME HIM. - 15,000. PUT YOUR MONEY DOWN! - 30 SECONDS! - 100 SECONDS! I GOT 45 SECONDS! JUST WENT... MAN, THAT WAS SO FAST. SARA, HOW MUCH RESEARCH DID YOU DO ON RAY BEFORE SETTING UP THIS TRIP? THE USUAL PROFILE: ORDAINED MINISTER... WIFE, THREE DAUGHTERS, GRANDDAUGHTER, DOWNTOWN CHURCH, WORKS WITH THE HOMELESS, THE FOOD KITCHEN-- YOU KNOW, THE WORKS. ELECTED TO CITY COUNCIL, BUT NOW THERE'S TALK OF HIM RUNNING FOR CONGRESS. - THE MAN'S GONNA BE PRESIDENT. - THAT'S CROSSED A FEW MINDS. WHAT ABOUT HIS MILITARY RECORD? BRONZE STAR, HONORABLE DISCHARGE, NO RECORD OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION. WHY? BECAUSE I'M THINKING THERE'S MORE TO OLD RAY THAN MEETS THE EYE. GET DIDEROT ON THE PHONE. I WANT TO SEE RAY'S SERVICE RECORD. WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE? WELL... I GOT BACK HOME... FOUND MY FAITH AGAIN. AND FAMILY. NO, NOT THAT. I MEAN, WHEN WE FIRST GOT HERE, YOU WERE A GOOD MAN. YOU WERE AN HONEST MAN. I GAVE MY LAST ONE TO-- - WHOA, WHOA, DON'T EAT THAT SHIT. V.C. MIGHT HAVE PUT SOME GROUND GLASS IN THERE OR SOMETHING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, COME ON. THEY'RE NOT GONNA POISON THEIR OWN KIDS. SO ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULDN'T CHECK FOR TRIPWIRES? SHUT UP, CHICAGO. I GAVE MY LAST ONE TO RAY. YEAH! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO THEM? I'M SAYING "HAPPY NEW YEAR! HAPPY NEW YEAR." HAPPY NEW YEAR!
