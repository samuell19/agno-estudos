Cassandra, what is the Pope doing? He drinks, he sleeps, he eats, takes a coffee, he goes to the window, he has fun and behaves as if Rome was empty. Think it as you want, but God gave the kingdom to the Pope! I believe the words of Don Frank. If you believe that you're a jerk. Calm down. If the governor gets upset it will be a pain for us! I don't care! You Romans are only good for having fun! Eight! What are you doing? Don't you know that this game is forbidden? Tell me what isn't forbidden! All you do is complain! Only filthy things are forbidden. Like drinking wine, eating, making love, having children. And you know how to make children, you dirty scoundrels! What's worse is that you want to talk! I loved someone who doesn't love me. Goodbye, go with God. Wherever you go, the Pope will screw you. What are you singing? You want to end up in jail? How dare you say that? No one goes to jail in Rome. Inside Castel Sant'Angelo, there's a step. He who hasn't climbed it can't claim to be Roman. Liar, no one goes to jail in Rome. You're under arrest. And you too. - And you too. - But... What do I have to do with this? They do nothing but talk! I didn't say anything! Walk. Walk! They say that with Pope Pius it was better. Pope Pius and Pope Leo are neat as long as I get to eat. Look at her. - Calm down. - He looks like a lion in a cage. Come on, let's play. See what a nice girl? She's the most beautiful in Rome. - Leave her alone. - Are you hermaphrodites? - What are you looking at? - Me? Do I know you? - Puffy cheeks. - No way! Puffy cheeks. Now shut up and go home. If you say something, I'll kill you. - Who are they? - They are Gnecco and Rosetta. You wanted to meet them and now you did. The husband is a spy for the government. - She's really beautiful. - She's the model of a sculptor. All of Rome is in love with her, but no one got anything from her. Well, I got a good slap. Nicehair, be more delicate with the torch! That is the flame of life fading away. It looks like you're killing bugs! Who is this nuisance? Good morning, Thorwaldsen, I'm Rugantino. - What do you want? Hurry, I'm busy. - We came to do something. Marquis Sacconi arrived, he's the husband of my sister. - Where? - Where? He had a stroke. Oh, I'm very sorry. No, you should be happy. We have a job for you. - I'm not a grave digger! - Let me do the talking. My brother was trying to say that due to what happened, the marquis... - should have a little statue. - So when he dies we'll be ready. Come in. How do you want this statue? Naked or dressed? Naked! Naked is better! What are you saying? Michele is 90 years old, you want him naked? Alberto. - It's late. - She's coming. - Come in. - Thank you. - Rosetta, your husband is here. - Don't let him in, I'm naked. - Be patient. - All right I'll wait outside. I don't understand, we can see her naked but her husband can't? - Everyone minds their own business. - And you everybody else's! - Tomorrow I'll take his measurements. - Very well. For the payment, come to me. I'm his heir. They don't ever laugh! - Hey! - Who's there? Who are you leaving the money to? You're dying. - Me? - And who else? Rugantino! - For God's sake, shut up! - You shut up! Did you make a will? Who are you leaving your money to? Half of it to my dear widow and the other half to Santa Rita's orphanage. This is what I have decided. - And to me? - I have left you this... Be good, Michele! You just took communion! For two years you have been eating, drinking and sleeping at my expense. What else do you want? - I want my part. - Are you my wife? No. Are you a Santa Rita's orphan? No. So, what do you want? What a heart you have! Your conscience doesn't burn? No, no, no! - I'll tell you something. - What? Calm down, Rugantino! Michele, don't believe him, don't listen to him. - Let him talk. - I'll say it anyway. - Do you want to hear something new? - What's new? Your wife Eusebia isn't my sister. What do you mean? What are you saying? Eusebia was my girlfriend. You liked her and I punished you. You wanted to marry her... and we made you believe that we were brother and sister. So we ate, drank and slept at your expense. And we kept making love. - Do you understand? - Eusebia! Is it true? What do you say now? What do I say? I say... Son of a bitch! - You're orphans from where? - From Santa Rita Orphanage. You ugly scavengers! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Who's that? Hey, you. Come here! Beating up an innocent soul... Rugantino! Please don't talk bad about me, I'm already the main topic here. My lips are sealed! - Swear you won't tell anyone! - You have my word! And so? And so I throw the truth on his face and say, "Your wife Eusebia isn't my sister!" And then? He said, "Son of a bitch!" And then died! Rugantino. That isn't funny at all. Of course! How can you laugh with such a face? You look embalmed. Can it be that when you have a woman, all Rome must know about it? Are you worried? Do you have a daughter to introduce me to? - A sister, an aunt. - What did you say? Rugantino, count your teeth, it's better. Say it again, if you dare. - I was just trying to be funny. - I don't find it funny. You don't have to laugh if you don't want to. Don't worry, we'll stay friends. I don't have any friends. I carry my best friend in my pocket. Don't use a knife in here. I never carry a knife, you know why. If I'd carry a knife, with my temper... Let's punch each other. Good job, fight! Did you ever drink in these glasses? Why do we have to fight? Move from there or you'll bang your head. I'll start. It's your turn now. Come on, big mouth. You missed. It's my turn now. Now you make me laugh. - How can you laugh with such a face? - And you carry on! Wait, it's not your turn. It's my turn. Now we laugh because first I insult you and then I'll beat you up. You stupid! Piece of sh... No, you know it's my turn. Laughing stock! Cuckold! Son of a bitch! Calm down! It's my turn, stay back. - You can't punch too. - Careful, the police are coming! - Now that is was my turn... - They better find us cheerful. Take the cards away. Come on, guys! Here you drink and you eat! With a good wine! Wine from the outskirts of Rome! Here you drink and eat! - Are you Rugantino? - Yes, why? - You're under arrest. - I'm innocent, I swear! - But I didn't tell you the crime. - But I'm innocent anyway. You defamed Marquis Sacconi, therefore you have been condemned. Let's go. What do I do? What have I done? - Leave me alone! - Walk! - So you learn to talk! - I never speak! So he'll learn not to talk, three days on the wheel! - Where are you taking me? - Rugantino. You defamed me. Don't you know that it's against the law? I defamed you? I said the truth. If Michele didn't die... I didn't die, I got better! Take that, Rugantino! Take that! He will never die! Rugantino, you ended up on the wheel! Why are you laughing? You can't never stop talking, can you? It's never enough? The procession is coming. You look good from far away! Rugantino, how are you? - Does this wheel spin? - Of course! When I'm free, I'll show you. You'll have lots to do! Spin, spin! Don't ever stop the wheel! Wow, we sing really well! Son of a bitch! Is your head spinning? - How are you? - I'm having fun. It's really brave of you to take it out on someone who is helpless. Rugantino, women take your part now? Can I do something for you? Wait until they free me and I'll do something for you. - Are you thirsty? Want water? - Yes, I'd like some. - I can't swallow it. - What can I do? Put me up again. Why are you doing this for me? - I'm a nice hearted woman. - Nice of heart and everything else. What are you doing tomorrow? They'll release me. You're running! - Where are you going? - Home. - Do you live nearby? - Just here, behind you. Now that I know it, I'll let them torture me every day! Good luck. She just feels pity for you. She has her eyes on me. After all, I'm very good looking. Even the noble men were rejected by her. How much do you bet that I'll get busy with Rosetta? You bet that you won't? - I'll get busy with her! - Have you seen her husband? - Want to bet? - Of course! Hurry with this bet! Stop, my head is spinning! Hurry, we need to hang this other one. - Your punishment is over. - Now it's my turn. Don't get upset when it's your turn! Stop the square! Everything is spinning! Don't take it out on me but on them! Careful! Oh, God! What are you doing? They should kill you! It was all your fault! You have a traitor tongue! I didn't do anything! Where are you going? They talk good about everyone, thieves, murderers and scoundrels. Here, if they don't beat you up, justice will. I'm used to it, I don't care. I was raised being slapped. I want to see who's stronger, those who beat me up or me sending them to hell! Hey, do nothing! Don't you hug your wives, they cheat on you! Old goats! Are you having fun? Life is good for you! After all, what do you care? You don't have to wake up! Are you dead? You want to wake up? Hey! Catch this cat! Who was it? Don't worry, I saw his face. We must get that son of a bitch. We'll whoop his ass, don't worry. I'll put them back. I'll take those of Saint Nicola, he's from Apulia, no one knows him. - To you. - What's this? I want to thank you for being nice to me. Do you know what happens if my husband sees you? - He would scratch his horns. - You have a good opinion of me. I'd be surprised if you didn't cheat on him, he doesn't deserve respect. - Actually... can I? - Tell me. Would you like to disrespect your husband with me? - How? - As you like and where you prefer. To Campo Vaccino, on Monte Testaccio, even in a building hall. How about a one night stand? Why not at my place? - In your house? - We'd get more comfortable. - Can we? - Of course. Let's go, then! Do you mind if I give it them to the Virgin? She doesn't have any. - Are you sure that we can? - Of course, let's go. Rosetta, since we are disrespecting your husband, - can I be less formal with you? - Do what you please. You're so beautiful! Get in. - Can I be less formal? - Of course. Wait a second, I'll be back. You can sit down. Meet my husband. This guy here likes me and I think he's serious about it. Go, I'll talk to him. You have a good relationship. You're a very good couple. Is this bed from the 18th century? What do you think about Rosetta? - Is she beautiful? - I didn't understand. No? Let's try to understand each other good. Let's speak man to man, you must be sincere. Would you sleep with Rosetta? Me? No! I respect your wife. I know this. I can tell you're an educated man. But a fling... You'd do. - Come on, from man to man! - I wouldn't. Do you think that a woman who has a big man like you, would like someone like me? Have a good look at me. Tell me if I am a man as well. No, say the truth. I won't get offended! Am I a man? And after all... They say not to get between husband and wife. - Don't you think? - But you did it. - What? - Your finger! And now I'll break it. - This one? - No, not the thumb! Don't scream. If my wife hears you, I'll break all ten of them. I'll break the index because it's the one that hurts the most. No, I need it! - Don't scream! - Who's screaming? - You're screaming! - But it hurts! - I didn't touch you. - It hurt before. - Shut up. - Do it softly, I beg you! - Silence! - Silence. Don't make a scene, it's just a broken finger. Now go. If I see you around my wife, I'll kill you. If you only heard what I told him! Go to console him. You were right, a woman like me can't go with someone like you. Did you hear everything? Do you know what he did to me? - Why did you do this? - To punish you. You saw me and you wanted to sleep with me right away. - In a building entrance! - And you call your husband? I wanted to see if you were a coward. Now go. If I see you again, I may kill you. You too? A family of assassins! Go to hell, all of you! Look at her! Who are you? Who do you think you are? Who knows you? Who thinks about you? I have all the women that I want! You aren't even beautiful! My finger hurts! This voice has bored me. - Shall we go? - And where? Wherever you go, you always get bored. Let's go to Pazzarelli, and make fun of the crazy people. - Why don't we go to the jail? - What for? We go under the window and scream, "The Pope died, you'll get amnesty tomorrow!" They'll be so happy for nothing. We will laugh so much! What's funny about this? Let's go to Ripetta, where those women walk. - What for? - Just to compete with them. That's too much. This game isn't funny. I'm serious, we'll have fun making them lose their clients. And if they believe you? We bring them here and you'll beat them up. Could do. Enrico, do you like your sister's idea? You decide, I'm grieving. - Let's go. - You keep singing. Don't worry, he isn't done yet. You see the French? He should seriously go to Ripetta. He wouldn't fall in love with the paintings. - Is she beautiful? - You like her, huh? She's not a painting, but a real woman. Her name is Rosetta. One of these nights I'll go under her windows and I'll sing for her, just like you Romans do. Really? After two months that you're dying over that painting, you're finally ready to serenade her? Do you think it's too soon? - Come on! - Who's coming with me tonight? When will you decide to make love? Are you made of butter? It's the third time you pass this way. Away, you're ugly! I don't want it anymore! No one is coming tonight. Do you want to leave? Good walk! You want to steal their clients but you're good for nothing! No one is even looking at my wife! I was having more fun with the singer. We are too skinny for these peasants. Let's split up or we'll draw attention. Did you come to take our place? - How much do you want? - For you I'll be cheap. No one wants to come with me? - Yes, we were just waiting for you! - Should I leave? - Don't run, I'll get you! - Stop! - Who are you? - We'll show you now! Turn... Get this! Hey, brown hair. What do you decide? Hey, do you whistle to the sheep? Hold it too. I feel like I'm the only one who is holding it! And you are. I do not want to dirty my hands. - What's in this sack? - Nothing, a peasant! Swiss, do you want to make love? Come on! Don't get them too big or we can't make them fall down. Or this game will get difficult! You don't look like one of them. I have a prince who takes care of me. - I just come here to have fun. - Do you want to have fun with me? All right, there's a place that's perfect for us. - How much will you give me? - What? Fun comes for a price. Who are you? Apollo? - How much do you want? One coin? - No. Why are you doing this with your finger? I do this to remember something. You're funny. Listen, I want to get paid and you want the same. Let's do it for free and we're fine! - Are you in? - For free? That's what I like! Where's this place? Wait. Wait a second. You changed your mind? Let's go some place different. Come with me. We had lots of fun. All right, it's better than nothing. My sister's good ideas! We are grieving, where could we go? Here she is. Where were you? I've been looking for you for an hour. We didn't move from here. Where did you go? You won't believe it, no one stopped me, so I sat on a bench and fell asleep. - Let's go, it's daylight. - Yes, let's go. Tomorrow I have to go to Tivoli, for charity for the deaf. Why do you help them? They can't even thank you. Outside of Rome, you'd make good money. - You know what? - What? If the singer was home waiting for us... - So he could cook for us! - You've always got food in mind. At least he could do something good. Do you want to come with me? I'm cheap. And you're worth even less! Niccolò. Look who's here. - Who? - The guy of the cat. - Do you want to make love? - I didn't pay tonight! - Are you sure? - Yes, son of a... Stop, don't rush. I have an idea. I'm flattered. Why did you invite me to eat? All princes are peculiar, sometimes we like to mingle with the filthy. Don't get offended, he likes to kid around. They set the table just for you because we have already eaten. We'll sit in front of you and look at you. - Excellency... - Sit down, don't worry. Don't be embarrassed. Are you comfortable? Yes, I am. What are you waiting for? Serve dinner! We are here to keep you company. - Can I? - Of course you can. - It's a cat! - It's not just a cat, it's the cat. The one that you threw in our house on the coffin of poor grandpa. It's good, it even has rosemary. You don't like it? - He doesn't like it! - You can't do this to me. You should have thought this before. Before disrespecting Prince Capitelli. Do you know who my ancestors are? Yes, of course I know. - Who are they? - If your father is still alive, he would be a son of a bitch! Niccolò, let him talk. Because it's good to have a little conversation while eating. You better eat. How is it? Very good! You don't have some mice as a side dish? I went to lunch at Prince Capitelli's, I ate so much! I still have it here. - Where did you go? - The Capitelli Palace? - And who invited you? - Prince Capitelli. - I don't believe you! - Did he ask you to come back? If you keep asking him, he'll say that at Capitelli Palace, he slept with a princess. I'd say it if I was a liar. I behaved properly, I just ate and then left. - You're such a gentleman. - But there were some lookers! You should have seen what beauty! Much better than Rosetta! Do you want to change your bet? That is? Since Rosetta refused you and now you hang out with the aristocracy, let's bet that you'll sleep with a princess. - Are you crazy? - We want to help you. - It's to make you win the bet. - Aren't you a prince's friend? Let's bet that you'll sleep with his sister Mirta. I don't know her and I won't bet. We said Rosetta and that's my bet. - A little more. - Of course. Good morning, Mastro Titta. You woke up today as well? Good morning, everyone. Cheers. - Can I sit down? - You're always welcome. Mastro Titta, you are the only one in Rome who can't get offended when they call you an assassin! That's not a laughing matter. I'm the executioner for the Pope. Being an executioner was my calling. At least do you earn good money? - For each one. - That is? I get something for each head. I'm at 299 heads. With the next one it will be 300, I'll get an award and get to retire. - When did you cut that one? - This morning, a guy from Frascati. I will have to go nail his head to his door - as the verdict says. - What guy from Frascati? Wasn't he that peasant friend of yours? - It can't be! - Did you know him? - Who knows him? - Was it him? - That's right. - Poor man! That's how they get! - He has the same complexion. - That's it. So, the bet with Rosetta is on? What? Who is this Rosetta? - The model. - He bet he'd sleep with her. What are you talking about? Rosetta is married. Be good guys or you will get in trouble. I'm sorry, Rugantino always keeps his word. I promised to sleep with her and I will. I just have to find her alone. I have an idea. - I'd eat your heart. - I'd eat you with kisses. - What are you doing? - I'm a model. - My physique helps me. - Yes... Rosetta, don't move! What is happening today? Nicehair didn't come, and this dead body came. Stop moving! And the arm fell off! Wait, I'll get a tool. Don't move. Rosetta, we are naked, huh? - And so? - It's a beginning. It doesn't take much. You are better naked than dressed. I know, it's the opposite for you. When you are dressed, you are less ugly. Do you think so? - Don't move! - Are you crazy? - I'll hurt you! - You would never! - Scram! - Come on, try to understand. Just a little bit. Rosetta, see and don't touch... You're something to die for. Come on, let's have a one night stand. I can, right? Back to your places. Thorwaldsen, this statue is stupid. Let's change the subject. Let's do "Cupid and Psyche". Naked and without the sheet, I grab Rosetta, like this. Do you know what I will grab? Careful, your voice will change. Go to your position. "Cupid and Psyche" is a beautiful subject. Today is not a good day. Put your clothes on. - Why so early? - Come on, let's go! So? - Move! - Go ahead, I'm coming. Stop. - Give me your hand. - So you can break another finger. Your hand! Only if you let me pick the finger to break. - Why do you want to choose? - You broke my index. If you break my pinky it will show your horns! Son of a bitch! Stop, coward! Beautiful girl, beautiful girl of Trastevere. What a miracle your made! To make such a great harmony. Beautiful girl, beautiful girl of Rome. If a painter would like to paint you, he wouldn't know where to start. - There's someone. - Stop, guys! - What's going on? - Gnecco is coming, run away! - Her husband is here, run away. - I'll take care of it. I was hoping to see a beautiful woman. I will be happy to have met a lucky man. Get your weapon. Why, what happened? Get your weapon. I am sorry that you feel offended. All right then, whatever you want. Christ, Jesus and Mary! He made a big hole. What did you expect? There is the guillotine for the murderer. It's for assassins, thieves, forgers and also for liberals. Do you remember Corsetti, the pharmacist? - Who told you about him? - You, I remember. I can leave then. You can leave, away from Rome forever. I don't want to see you around anymore. You should be thankful that the Pope closes an eye for his loyal citizens. I have to leave Rome? Is this how you thank me? You either get banned or you end up on the guillotine. You decide. I'll get lost outside the walls. Where should I go? It is what it is. Another thing. Remember that you ran away from here alone, no one let you out. Gnecco, listen to me, death is ugly. Listen, I'll leave the door open, wait two minutes and go. Prisoners! Does Gnecco live here? - The next number! - Thank you. Gnecco, come out. Where are you? - He isn't here. - And where? At the window by the corner. - Careful, he bites! - Really? Cuckold! - Who's there? - That's me. No, I'm Rugantino and you are the cuckold. Tomorrow morning, the executioner will give you a good shave. Rugantino, because of your tongue you'll end up dead. And you will end up in a different way? Tomorrow will be fun! Mastro Titta told me to wake him up early... so I can hold his basket. I don't want to do things behind your back. After they shave you, I'll go to visit your wife. I really want to fulfil this dream! Gnecco! You don't answer anymore? Wait, I'm talking to someone. - You have a fixation with fingers! - Shut up, don't scream. I won't. If the guards hear you, I'll break all ten of them. No, my thumb, no! My thumb, no! Fuck you! You told him that I have a two? You're a cheat! I was getting tired. Is this the time to show up? - Who are talking to? - Come, I'll take you home. - Why? - You've been alone for two months. I don't need help. Leave, it's better. You understand? All right, I'll walk behind you then. I'll guard you anyways. Yes, just like a dog. Stop, he looked at you. Look what happens now. Why did you look at her? I don't understand you. - Puffy cheeks. - What do you mean? - Puffy cheeks. - What are you talking about? Puff out your cheeks! - How can I? - Like this! Son of a bitch. He slapped me. - Can I, beautiful bride? - You're stubborn! What do you want? Why do you treat me bad? I came here to cheer you up. Do you go to the houses to cheer people up? Are you a buffoon? I came here to cheer you up and make you smile. Your face would gain from that. I don't want to. Read this letter. Ah, you read good. You tell me to read! But I'm not good at that. I'll read it then, listen. It's from my husband. The scribe told me what it says. "Dear wife, careful what you do." "If someone courts you, I'll come to Rome and kill you both." - Understand? - He will kill us? No, not you. Me and the guy who courts me. - And I'm not courting you? - You're making me nervous. Rosetta, don't get upset. I was just joking to cheer you up. - Laugh! - Take those hands away! It's for a poor blind man. Thank you, miss. Thank you, you're generous. It's for a poor blind man. Thank you. Are you burning money? Lucky you, you have a lot. Look what happens! Play, we'll eat today! - Thank you. - Come down. I'm ready. Thank you, may God repay you. Son of a bitch! The skin of the finger is still attached to it! You have fun with stupid things? - Me? No. - Why you do them then? I just wanted to make you laugh. Rosetta, we could hang out sometimes. Even just for a stroll. - I don't want anything else. - That would be fun. Let's make a pact. If I make you laugh once... you will sleep with me. How beautiful, I like him. - Who? - The angel. That? Doesn't he look like me? - You're the same person! - But he looks like me. - How are you? - What do you think? - Smile! - Stop it. You're so grumpy. It's more important for a man to sleep with someone without no one knowing about it, or not doing it but making everyone believe that he did. - This is crazy. - Men are just crazy. Why sleep with a beautiful woman if no one knows about it? Do you know what I'd do to you? If you just decided to sleep with me, I'd offer you something incredible. - What? - Silence. What do you mean? I'd be silent about it and won't tell anyone. I started to court you just because... all my friends were saying that I had no chance. So I committed to do it... and tell them about it. Why do you offer me silence now? Because I just realized that I fell in love. You are in love? Now you make me laugh for real! Don't say nonsense! Rosetta! Rome, don't play with me tonight. Help me make her fall in love. Pick up all the stars, all the shiniest stars you have and a slice of moon, that's all for us two. Make her feel it's almost spring. Send out your best crickets to sing "cri cri". Lend me the breeze, the naughtiest breeze you got. Rome, help me out tonight. Rome, don't play with me tonight. Help me make her fall in love with me. Pick up all the stars, the shiniest starts you got. And a slice of moon that's all for us two. Make her feel it's almost spring. Send out your best crickets to sing "cri cri". Lend me the breeze, the naughtiest breeze you got. Rome, don't play with me tonight. Do you hear the crickets? - It's you. - Me? It's not me, it's actual crickets. Yes, whatever! I feel like I'm in paradise. But, Rosetta, I realized that... Alone we are not happy, not even in paradise. Why are you laughing? I was thinking about the player who got the burning coin, he must be crying, still! What a day! It never ends. Are you getting tired? Should I take you home? I didn't laugh so much since I was a child. Since my grandma fell down the stairs! Do I make you laugh? This never happened to me before. It's funny, I feel like my heart is fully open, like a door. It's fun to laugh and be merry. Leave those rocks alone and come here. There's nettle there. You talk too much, come here. We had a deal. If I'd make you laugh... Shut up. Rosetta, so you care for me a little bit. Don't start with these things. Excuse me. Don't apologize, we are happy. Don't ruin everything. - You think about him? - Who? - Gnecco, your husband. - I don't even remember his face. I cared for him once when I was silly and I'd fall in love. If those who fall in love are silly, then I'm the biggest fool! Remember Corsetti the pharmacist, of Sant'Andrea della Valle? Are you talking about the Jacobin... I loved him with all my life. And he didn't even notice it. He organized a revolt. Now I remember. That's why he was sent to his death. - No one knows who reported him. - Gnecco had him killed. Since that day, my heart is made of stone, I don't feel anything. - What are you doing? - Nothing, I'm getting dressed. Did you get offended? Come on! What do you want? Don't be upset. You're cute when you laugh, when you say silly things. Come on, laugh! This would have been a shame. And what's good about it? It's better to say it in person. I'm telling you because you are my best friend. I must tell someone! Listen to me. Today I slept... with Rosetta. No! You're incredible! Please, don't tell anyone. - It's not important! - Shut up! Why are you crying? - I have one thing left to do. - Are you committing suicide? I'll tell you something then. But then you have to do it, you can't think it back. To make a long story short, I slept with Rosetta. Rosetta, the model! Gnecco's wife! What do I care? Couldn't you wait until I was done telling you? To not make us realize that he failed, he'd kill himself. I understand and I like you anyway. What's wrong about a woman who says no to you? We made a bet, will you talk or not? What can I say? Here, he's drunk. What should I say? You must say that you are a liar, a scoundrel, someone who is good just at talking. - Another one? - Drink. Let them talk. Who told you that she refused me? If I do something with Rosetta, should I tell you? Leave them alone, talk to me. We can keep a secret. I don't talk because I respect the lady. But to be honest... I slept with Rosetta. It's a shame that I can't tell you. I must be correct. - I'll go there again tonight. - Who are you telling this story to? Think of another one! Liar! Buffoon! If you do what I say, I'll prove it to you tonight. - I'll go. - No, I'll go, or tomorrow everybody will know that I have men over. Don't move. - Who could it be? - I don't know! Remember that I love you. Do you have some bread for the orphans of Sant'Antonio? Wait a second. His pants! Yes, they are his. To you, I have nothing else. Thank you, Saint Antonio will see this. - It was you. - What? Out! Get out! Out! You're too beautiful, Miss! Out! Go away! I said out! Put the pants down! Give me back my pants, this game isn't funny anymore. Now you have to leave, all of you. Rosetta, let me talk. Don't you talk to me, I don't know you. Put your pants on, you're losing your dignity. Out! Go away! Out! Be good. I can't let you in, they are getting undressed. They are all women. The sculptor promised to go to the float with them. This year the Pope is letting us celebrate Carnival. Sculptures, painters and models are going to have fun together. - Talk to Rosetta at home. - She doesn't want me around. She doesn't want to see me. Miss, I'm going crazy. I love her, I can't sleep anymore. All right, hurry. Let's get undressed, we must be ready in an hour. Come on, have no fear. I'm ashamed of having people seeing me. I'm a good person. And I'm not? There's nothing bad about it. We are models, we are part of the sculptor's group. Rosetta. - I must talk to you, listen. - Come closer, I'm listening. Make him leave! We must get naked! Hurry, talk. You don't mind if we get naked. I never got naked in front of a man. Don't worry, he isn't a man. Rugantino, don't be ashamed. You're a child to me. What do you want to say? Help me. I've been a jerk and a buffoon. I have no secrets. You can talk to me. I need a witness when talking to you and you like when things are well known. - Rosetta, we'll get undressed then! - Go on! Rugantino, did you see her? See how beautiful she is when naked? - She isn't beautiful when dressed. - What about me? Get undressed as well, he is harmless. He is a good friend but you can't do anything else with him. See what an abundance? What did you want to tell me? Long live the Pope! Long love Pope Pius who gave us Carnival back! Long live freedom to mask if we want to! This year there is Carnival? Yes, the Pope permitted it and we are happy about it! So the people will be happy and screwed, because masks are beautiful but in Rome we could get killed. This is offensive to the authorities and incitement to public discontent. You're under arrest. May you die! Please shut up. You always get me in trouble. - Where are you taking me? - To the tavern to drink! We got dressed as policemen! So you'll learn to dress up like a policeman! But I'm a real policeman! Son of a bitch! You ruined my uniform! Stop! Rosetta, you're gorgeous! Rosetta, you're so beautiful! - You're the best in Rome! - I know! Fir flower, go to paradise without a ladder. Spend some time with the angels and come back. Winter flower, I'll go to paradise and come back. What are you waiting for to see what you lack? Come on! Stop it. Why that face? Are you already at lent? Who are you? I don't know you. Here! Now you know me? - Did you read the edict of whores? - No. If they find you masked, they'll torture you. I'm having so much fun! Here, play some music. Do you want to come with me? Come on, like the other time. No, not to be rude, but I don't want to. Rugantino, look at me. - What? - You're in love. - Even if, what do you care? - Nothing. Let me give you some advice. Just let go, we women are... They are all like me, just have fun. I'm having fun, don't worry. See how I'm having fun? Vinegar flower, Gnecco came back to Rome. Someone must make him feel welcome. Did you hear? Gnecco is back. I knew it. He took advantage of the fact that everybody is masked. Let's see who will have to stab him. Who gets the short one will do. Liberal Romans aren't good just at talking. Who killed Carnival? Who killed Filippo with the beautiful wife? Who killed Prince Capitelli? Who killed all the princes? Who killed those who raise the price of bread? - It wasn't me! - Who killed my father? When we get home you'll see, son of a bitch! Who killed who I know? He's coming, come on! Who killed who doesn't want to make love? Who killed who doesn't want to kiss me? Who killed who doesn't have a candle? It's you again! What do you want from me? At least get a candle. I told you, I want to do it again. I liked you. You liked me? Then scream. - I like you! - Louder! Scream louder. - Why? - Just like that. Scream! I like you, Rugantino! I like you! I'm coming with you. I'll spend Carnival night with the best looking woman in Rome. I'll spend Carnival night with the best looking woman in Rome! - Gnecco. - Who's there? A friend of Corsetti, the pharmacist you had killed. What did you do? Did I have to ask your permission? What happened? Rugantino killed Gnecco. He drove a knife into his chest. Gnecco? But wasn't he gone? - Stop! - Run away, the police are coming! Rugantino, hurry up, they are coming! Don't move! You're under arrest! - What's going on? - Someone ran away. It's Rugantino, he killed Rosetta's husband. Rugantino? I don't believe it! Don't you see it? I told you it was him. Who told you so? Damned be my tongue! Come get me if you can. In the church I have sanctuary! - The permission from the vicar? - I'll go get it. - Give me the knife. - The knife? Here, it isn't mine. Careful, he is quick. Careful what you do, give me the knife. - So you are scared! - Stop it, give me the knife. Here! Throw it on the ground. Stay here, we'll run to the vicar. Careful, he is a tough man! Back off. Go to sleep. Come on! Where did he go? I don't know. - General, Rugantino tricked you! - Shut up. They will get him, Rome is small. He can't hide. Are you crazy? Get down! Do you want them to get you? I must pee. I have been here for ten hours. My wife is coming, go back in. There's the Cardinal for the usual wine. - We don't have it anymore! - What? The barrel is full. Move! - Did you drink it all? - I told you it's over. I'll bring the cardinal some Lacryma Christi, maybe it's better. Sure. - I must get out! - You can't! - The cardinal is here. - I don't care, I want to go out. - Get inside. - I can't, I am exploding! Go back in, my wife is coming back! - And so? - He wants that other wine. Yesterday it was full, there must be something left. There is so much! I'm glad! We must please the cardinal. - I don't need to go out anymore! - I hope that you die! Until Scariotto will take you farther than China, no one can find you. Even Rosetta told me so. Does Scariotto know that I am in one of those barrels? He didn't know it before. Now he knows. And who told him? You. You told him just now. Don't worry, you can trust me. Is everything ready? Can I call the men to load him? Yes, call them. Scariotto will come back soon. What's inside that barrel? What else could it be? It's wine. The cardinal drank it and said that he want to verify it to know what I put in it! He called the guards. - Good evening. - Scariotto, come. - Which one do we have to load? - This one. Everybody stop! Don't move anything. I am sorry but I have to. Rome is full of food frauds. I'm making a law against food scams and you give me that wine that had a taste... Where did you get it? From that barrel. Do you want to check it? Right now. Here it is, Cardinal. This is the best wine in the area. Cheers! It's better if you taste it. - It's good. - It was a mistake. Maybe it was the cat, but the wine is good. - Yes, it is good. - How could we do something to you... An Holy Mary. Let's pray. Are we alone? Answer me, did they leave? Whose is this voice? - Who talked? - No one! Good evening, can I kiss your hand? What a beautiful ring! We always say it, don't we? Cardinal Severini is always so elegant! Much better than the Pope! We hope to get a promotion soon! A Pope like you, we wish! - So I drank... - The water of a creature! - The dew of an innocent! - An innocent? You killed a man! Get him! Rugantino, I want to cry. - I couldn't do anything. - What do you want to say? - It's for tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Damn! Don't say it. Tomorrow you will be dead too. There is no hope? - If the Pope died, you'd be paroled. - How is he feeling? Rugantino, he is as healthy as a cricket! Everybody is fine. I'll send you the barber. He will cut your hair very short, this is the rule. I'm not a murderer. I would brag about it, but I didn't hurt anyone. I'm a coward! I'll speak, I want to save myself! All right! I am feeling bad and instead of making it easier for me, - you do this! - Do you know what we could do? If you prefer, tomorrow I will come with the head in my hand, so I will save your pain and sorrow. Mastro Titta, listen to me. That night I was with a girl from Ripetta, she can testify to it. When we arrived to Rosetta's house, Gnecco was already dead. - What are you saying? - It's the truth, I swear. Yes, sure! No, this time you will not get my head! - Go to Ripetta, find her. - Who is she? What is her name? I don't know, but you can't go wrong. She is a cute brunette. She doesn't look like one of them. You can ask the others, they know each other. You must be quick! I swear, it's true! If it's true, why you didn't say anything? Because... I have been stupid. People said that I wasn't a puppet anymore and I felt confident. They said that I was finally a man. I don't want to be a man, I want to live! I want to live! - Run! - I won't run, I won't run! I will go because I care for you, but you seem crazy to me. I will save myself, of course I will. Fuck me, I will save myself! - So? - She isn't there, Rugantino. - Did you look well for her? - Yes, she is nowhere to be found. Or maybe she doesn't exist. What should I do now? I don't want to die. I don't want to die. - Now Rosetta loves you. - I don't care about her. I care only about myself. Prisoners, cheer up! There is a good news, open your heart! The Pope died, they will give you amnesty! - The Pope died, poor man! - Poor man? I got spared, you will not take off my head! The Pope died! The Pope died, Mastro Titta! I'll be saved! Imbeciles! It's not true! We were laughing at you! May you have a stroke! Look how upset he got! You believed us, didn't you? What is your name? Come here! Come here, what is your name? It's her, the girl from Ripetta! That is Mirta Capitelli. She is the sister of the prince. - It's her! - I'm going! I can't say no to you, with what is facing you. I will save myself! - Long live freedom! - Rugantino! Rugantino. - Rosetta. - They didn't let me see you, but now I am here and I will stay all night long. What happened to you? Who did this to you? I cut my hair and they don't have to grow back again! I made a vow, I said, "Virgin Mary, save him and I will cut my hair." Your hair was so beautiful. Rugantino, no one will look at me. See? Am I ridiculous? Now I will make you laugh. I don't care. People in the street will say, "Look at her, she was Rugantino's woman!” So you know and you will know forever. I have changed, I wanted to apologize. - For what? - Everything. When I disrespected you in front of the girls and I said you were not a man. Everybody must take their hat off when you pass by. All of Rome must know that we made love, that I slept with you because I love you. I love you too. You are like the angel of the castle for me. - Come. - What do you want? Leave me alone! - I want to stay here! - Let go of her! Rosetta. Don't go! - Don't go, I will die tomorrow! - They take me away but I am here. When you want me, call me. I love you. - I love you. - Rosetta, don't go! Let her go! - Rugantino, I love you! - I love you too! I'll be on top of the Janiculum Hill, I will keep you company! Call me! Mastro Titta told me that you are looking for help. No. I don't need you anymore. I am glad to see that you are fine. Do you know what they say? "Death is good because it doesn't spare the rich or the poor". Yes, but in the end... Always the poor die. It's not my fault, you guys are more. You kindly give me a cat to eat. And with the same kindness I want to tell you something. I slept with your sister. I did her. And now we are even. I know, I know. Poor soul, she had this fantasy. It's very boring here, but there's nothing to be ashamed about. If she slept with a prince it would have been a scandal. But with you... It's like if she did some charity. Ask her to come before tomorrow to make another act of charity. I won't dirty my hands. You are about to die. Actually, I had to go on a fox hunt, but I will come to see you instead. Take your sister with you, so you will learn what is dignity. You are a horned prince! What happened? He didn't want to help you? Did you really think that I was innocent? I don't understand you. I am happy to die, I am happy. If, for all of his life, one has been a buffoon, capable only of bragging, and then he has the chance to finally be a real man in front of those who love him. He must do it, even if it costs him his life. He becomes all he wanted to be. May you be damned! I can't kill you, I'd rather resign! Are you crazy? You can't resign. My head will be number 300 for you. You will get the award and a good pension. You can't do this to me. You have a light hand. I am sure that you will not hurt me. You must cut my head. To thank you, I will come visit you in your dreams. That's the last thing I want! I will give you lotto numbers. Mastro Titta, please, everybody must come to take their hat off for me. Otherwise, why die? Hear this. - Rosetta, are you still there? - I'm here, Rugantino. - Who am I for you? - You are the angel of the castle! Of course I am dying, it's more convenient for me! It's like that. It has been like that since that day. My man in front of God. It is like that, and it will always be. My man I made it. Like a mother, more than a mother. He is mine. Only mine. He was a buffoon and now he is a man. He is more of a man than you. Then all of you. Yes, he is my man. Rugantino, raise your head. If they are cutting it, it means that you have one! - Dad, who are they killing today? - Shut up, or I will take you away! It is much better to go to the chariot. Those who walk fall. - Pumpkin seeds! Pumpkin seeds! - Give me a bag. Dying for a woman, is there anything more stupid? If you meet my grandfather, greet him for me! - Rugantino! - Mom! I have been looking for you for three months, where were you? I just heard that they will cut off your head. - What a shame! - Is a shame to steal. Don't go around with that child like that. Wash his face. I feel pity for him. Think about yourself! You do nothing but criticize! Don't hurt him, he's a friend. I'm not a butcher! Show them who you are, show them how to die. You will see that it's nothing, it's like making love. - She is the wife! - How beautiful! Go away! Why did you come here? I don't want you to see me like this, we said goodbye yesterday. No, that was a lie, I am glad that you came. I am dying of fear. If you don't look me in the eyes, I will scream that it wasn't me. Look at me, Rosetta. Don't worry, I will see you on the other side. Sooner or later, I will come too. I am glad that you came. Those who meet often care for each other. Don't ever doubt it. What are you talking about? If I told you the truth, would you love me anyways? I better hurry and die or I will change my mind. What are you laughing about? Nothing. I was thinking about something. Don't think about it. Think about your soul. Rosetta, I don't know why, but I would like to sing a song for you. Do you remember that time that I sang for you? What should I sing now? I'm Rugantino, I'm good only at singing silly songs. Flower of rain. Look at me, look at me again. I die, to be a man I'll endure this pain. Flower of death, the angel of the castle has left. And his sword he threw in my breast. I thought I heard your voice singing a song to me. Are you ready? Yes. Good night, everyone. Have a nice trip. Rome, don't play with me tonight. Help me make her fall in love. Pick up all the stars, all the shiniest stars you have. And a slice of moon that is all for us two. Make her feel it is almost spring. Send over your best crickets to sing "cri cri". Lend me the breeze, the naughtiest breeze you got. Rome, help me out tonight. Rome, don't play with me tonight. Help me make her fall in love with me.
