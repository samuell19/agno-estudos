Allow me to tell you a tale, A tale resembling a game of chess. This story, unlike any in books or history, unfolds. Because.. Apart from myself, No one knows this story as well as I do. This story revolves around Eswar and Basava, portraying their unique journey. The story took its origin in a village called Ranasthali. DURING THAT ERA, SR.

I heard that educated people become great people. Even I want to study. That’s why I killed him. So put me in jail and get me educated. RANASTHALI Exactly after 20 years. In the deep forest of a place named Enugula Vaagu.. The big wolf is waiting to recover and fight again. Bear it bro. Wound should be healed and should kill those bastards. Bear it bro. What happened Ambareshu? Sent against whom? Do you know against whom you send them? What is that rage! What is the way of killing? Fire is playing near his eyes. He is as angry as Load Shiva. Bro. We should've guessed, why you sent us on your behalf! That whom he is. He killed every one in a fraction of second. Hey Ambaresh, relax and tell us what happened. Bro. We killed many people but.. This guy hanged them by killing them brutally. He should be somewhere here. Where is he? Where ever he may be. This is what we need. Hey. 'Hail Kaala Bhairava' Hey. Hey.. Don't panic, I won't kill you. Go and inform him. that it's very easy for me to kill him. But he has to come here and I should feel his death. Till then I won’t stop this killing spree. I won’t stop. I can’t Bhadra. I can’t Bhadra. Just leave me.. Just leave me. How can you talk like that bro? Bhadra has helped you a lot. He helped you to get raised. Show some faith on him. Hey Musali. One should be alive to show faith. It is not as easy as you think. That guy.. He is guarding the corpse as a guardian. Hey Bhadra. You won't get your brother's corpses until he's alive. You won’t get. Don’t drag me into this I am leaving. Brother, Ambresh.. Wait brother, Ambresh. The people we sent against him are either dead or frightened! Can’t we do anything? Bro. Shall I send a message to Ramayya, who is in jail? What? Have you gone mad? Even Ambaresh is scared. What will that old man do? -Ramayya alone may not do anything. But you both together can do. The air should combine with fire to scorch things. My name is Muniyya, a cobbler. He loves his son a lot but... Uncle, Come fast uncle. Venkatesh, hold on, I'm coming Come fast uncle. He can't wait for a while. Come fast. I have to give his food and go to my farm -Coming. Take it. Hey, I've prepared his favourite food tell him to eat properly. Okay, I will tell him. Hey, one more thing. Should ask him to come home? He won’t listen uncle He is not in situation to think about us. The forest is everything to him now. You and your belief. Okay. I will ask for you. Hmm. Did they come again? How many? Did you kill everyone? Speak something. By looking at you, we are scared more than your enemies. Will you just kill people like this? How many days you will hold this anger? Speak something. Venkatesh we can control pain or happiness. We can't stop our anger. We won't think once before showing it on the people. That’s why I respect my anger. You learnt philosophy while staying in jungle? Think whatever you want to. But, my wrath is more sacred to me. Okay, but what are you doing with those dead bodies. You won’t say. Asking you is my fault. Lord Shiva, forgive me. Even we feel bad for what happened to you. But don’t forget that an old man is waiting for you. Be careful. You created a burial ground in this forest. Bhadra. Tell him not to worry I will leave this forest with his head. Don’t underestimate him Bhadra. Leave, as your work is done. Bro. Tell me. It has been 4 months since our brothers were killed. Till now we didn't do their last rights. It’s good to complete the rituals. Please think once. Okay. Call the priest. All of you. Please listen to me. I will talk to Bujji. Sudarshan is the owner of this Quarry. But Bujji handles this. Bujji is also a human.. Everything will be fine, until his skull goes up! The work has been stopped since 2 hours. What's happening here? Sir. Well, sir. They are paying 500 bucks in the other quarry. But here we are paid only 300. Our people are asking to increase 100 bucks. Look, you should not ask to increase the pay I should feel it. Whenever I feel to.. then I'll increase. Go and start the work. Go. Are you senseless? Why are you asking him? It’s our hard earned money. Will ask our Sudarshan sir. Will see why they won’t increase? What you will ask? How am I looking to you? How dare you question us? Hey.. If you leave from here and try to work in other quarry. I'll make sure that you won't get any work. Forgive us, sir. Shut up, Go and continue the work. Go. Dad. It’s bleeding a lot. what happened my son? Get up . Get up getup my son. Please don’t cry, Sit there? Sit there? Hold your pain, I'll be back in a minute Coming.. It's a glass piece Let me take it out. Don’t worry, it'll be recovered if I apply this turmeric. Please don’t cry my son. Dear. Basava Wear these slippers. Are they good? Yes dad. What's this Muniya? You don’t have slippers but you got one for your son! Leave about me He should be good Hello. What are you thinking? Stitch the slippers soon He should go to school. Sir. By seeing these I remembered my son’s childhood slippers. Okay, stitch fast. I'll do it now. -Okay. [chanting] [chanting continues] [chanting] Wash your hands, son Now take three spoons of water. [chanting] [chanting] Sir, where are the ashes? Sir, can't we do without ashes? We can't perform without ashes. Everyone takes lite about rituals. You come and perform this. No sir, we didn't even find their bodies. What? you didn't find their bodies! So they had the worst death. Priest. I am respecting your profession Priest should talk properly. Be careful. We shouldn't perform without ashes. If we do so! They'll not rest in peace. They'll not rest in peace. Did you observe this? He made a weapon like me to be out of the war. Let this wound heal. I will definitely kill them. Who are you? Kaali.. Kaali.. Vara. What happened bro ? They killed our Kaali and Vara infront of me. I was helpless. I don’t know how they are feeling. But me and my brothers are rotting in hell. I want my brother’s corpse. Brother.. Brother.. Who are you? Nobody comes here right why are you here? Bro, I'm from a nearby village I make livelihood by selling branches. The other side of the jungle was burnt, so I came here. I swear that, I came for branches. If you want branches go that way. If you come here again. Are you going to meet Basava again? Why do you ask the same question even after knowing the answer? Aren't you tired? Why won't I be tired? I'll be tired enough as, I gave birth to an idiot like you. You and your flattering things. I told you many times to not befriend a beast like him. But you won't. I'm tensed about you, as they might hurt you instead of him. She started. Mom, remember one thing. Neither I wished to be your child. Nor you wished to give birth to me. But befriending him is my decision. I do trust my decision. You keep quite. Don’t argue. Yes, you'll always feel this as an argument. You moron. You are a replica of your father even in color and behavior too. Both are same. It’s too hot. Irritating. Uncle, why did you come here? I would have come right. Dear, I'll come along with you today. Uncle. No uncle. He told you not to come right. I am too eager to see him. Please take me. -Uncle. He is guarding those corpse. You can’t see him in that condition. I am his father Please take me to him as I want to see my son. I can’t say know to you Okay, let him scold me, will go. Come let’s go. Careful uncle. Slow. God. We almost reached. Careful. You don’t have slippers But you got one for your son! Leave about me He should be good. Wait uncle. Uncle. Uncle, you came to see him. But you're leaving without talking to him. I came to see him. I saw him. If he sees me his anger will reduce. His anger shouldn’t be reduced. His anger should be the same and kill them all. Kill them all. Hello. Hello, Can you heare? Brother. Hello. Ramayya is going to be released from jail tomorrow. -Is it? Yes Bro. Shall i call him.. ok Bro. Bro. Ramayya is going to be released from jail tomorrow. My brother's dead bodies should be with us by tomorrow. Basava should be hanged. Ask Ramayya to meet Bhadra after getting released from jail. All the owners of quarry.. Decided to form an association and selected you as the president. Why me, sir? There are so many people who are elder than me. Select anyone from them. Even we are older, we feel that you are capable as you are intelligent and well known. Sudarshan.. Greetings ma'am How are you? Fine. Are you all fine? Apart from death none should defeat you. You contest as president. Sudarshan. Are you aware of the issue in quarry. Issue! What issue? Nobody informed me No one will let the mistake to be known to the higher authority. But, it's our responsibility to know about that Do you understand? -Hmm. Inform Bujji to meet me. Okay, sir Seshu, stop the car. Okay, sir. What about the issue in the quarry? Nothing Sudharshan A small fight with the labour. Everything is fine. Did you sort it out? Is all ok? -Yes. Stupid, Do you think I don’t know anything? Do you think I am an idiot, to believe your words, wastrel? Labour should fear about us. If they lose the fear.. They will start revolt. If they stop working, Will you work on their behalf? Seshu stop the car. Get my slippers stitched with the cobbler and come to the office. Why to stitch these now? There is a shop nearby let us buy new one. Hey Bujji, you won’t change. Slippers should be given to a cobbler and Rocks should be given to labour. If they start thinking as they don't have work. One day we should work under them. Shut up and do as I say. Brother. I'm respecting you as you are elder than me or else it would be different. Now go. Seshu let's go. Hey. Slippers were torn. Stich these soon. -Okay, sir. He didn't even respect my age before beating me, punk. Can you please stitch these slippers? Ok dear, I will stitch. How much? -No need of money dear. You are pregnant why did you come out in this hot sun dear. I came out for work. Stupid labour. You kept my slippers aside. Even you look down on me! Sir why are you beating me? Sir stop this. Sir she is pregnant so I was stitching her slippers first. You didn't have enough food but your pride is out of blue. Why are you beating me? Sir what is this? Suri, Do the hair cut properly. Okay. Hey Venkatesh, somebody is beating your uncle. Where? I'm stitching her slipers first as she is pregnant. What's wrong in that sir? And you are beating me. Should I wait in the sun until you stitch her slippers? Stupid. Hey. Even you look down on me. What do you think about me? His name is Ramayya and was a good friend of Bhadra's father They used to do many robberries together. After Bhadra's father passed away. He was in jail for 5 years and got released today. Uncle drink some water. Uncle what happened, why are you bleeding? What happened bro? Sudharshan's relative Bujji beat me for not stitching his slippers first. We have to tell this to your son. Don't burden him more, Venkatesh. -No uncle He has to know. Venkatesh, please stop. How you used to be and how are you now, Bhadra! How is the one who raised his hand on you alive? What happened? Bhadra Your father is like a brother to me. Your enemy is my enemy too. Where does he stay, Musali? Hey bro. We should het those corpses somehow and make Bhadra happy. No dear, please stop Listen to me. Listen to me dear. Sir, You beat someone in the morning it seems. You beat someone in the morning it seems. So what. His son came to talk to you, sir. Oh, is it -Yes sir. Where is he? Right there sir. This stupid dealing with the labour in the morning. Isn't what your father had in the morning sufficient? You came now. Why are you so envious about me? Look.. How dare you hit me? You. Hey, What are you doing? You called us as low caste In my view there are only two castes. One is rich and the other is poor On festivals you will use 20 feet idol. But we will use only 1 feet idol. Only we see the difference among people. But everyone are same in the eyes of god You moron. Well-done bro. What happened to this? I think it's chain is not appropriate bro. Wait let me see. There are two ways, which way should we use? Even I'm confused uncle, after the scorch the forest directions got changed I'm confused uncle You moron. It's my mistake to believe you for directions. How to return and face Bhadra now Bujji is your wife's relative too. He is from our caste If you don’t react to this Those people will take advantage of this incident. There were no witness for the crimes he committed. But today everyone saw him stitching Bujji's mouth. Just give one complaint we will arrest him and close this matter. Why did you call me? What do you want to do in this matter? Beating Bujji is not correct. How can we leave that Basava. They should also know our strength. Everyone will have their own strength Sudarshan. But it should be used wisely. I believe that you are wise and intelligent. The people working for us belongs to the same community of Basava. If you give complaint on Basava They'll get united. We will loose lot of money, if they won't work for a single day. You are getting good will as a politician. We have to mingle with everyone. Think about your future, not about Bujji. I thought about this incident. I already knew that we have to face such an incident because of Bujji's attitude. Consider this as a fight between two individuals. Don’t create a conflict between two communities. Sir. I'll tell what to do at the right time. Now you can leave. Musali. Forgive us Bhadra Work is not done. But don’t worry. By tomorrow we will get your brother's dead bodies. You told they are capable! They didn’t even touch enemies’ shadow. Uncle.. Do you know the audacity of Duryodhana to start Kurukshetra? Neither because of the kingdom nor that he is a king.. It's because of the belief on Karna. Did you think I started this war as you're with me you? Dead bodies will come. Bhadra. Who is he uncle? Bhadra's youngest brother Karna. He is the Brahmastra to Bhadra. He uses him whenever the situation becomes tough. Kali. The sea will be worse because of cyclone, not the fish. Even Bhadra is like a sea. We knew Bhadra's anger. But we don’t know his depth.. Dad. What dear.. Today aunt and her daughter are coming right. Should I go to school.? Don’t try to bunk school. They will stay here itself You go to school and come. Ok. What Muniyya? Yes. You said your sister and her daughter are coming today. Bus reached it's stop. Go then. -Is it? I'll go and get them. Ammulu, How are you? I brought guavas for you from Chakravarthi's farm. Take them. Ammulu I am talking to you. Dad. What happened? Where is aunt? Aunty. Aunty. Dad, Did aunty come or not? What happened? I'm talking to you. Why are you sitting idle? What is it? Read this. What is this? The mistake I've done can't be excused with my apologies. But. And I can't even do some good to her. I'm struggling to feed her. It's a sin to not being able to feed our kids. The only property I can give her is the gold chain you gifted me. You are the only one for me in this world brother. I'm leaving her with you. Please feed her atleast out of pity. Those memories haunt us, so we should be busy always.. you should mingle with others. Today onwards go to school dear. Hey, why are you throwing the books into fire? What happened to you? From tomorrow I won't go to school. Thats why am throwing the books into fire. What. Why won't you go? I'm fed up with studies. I don’t want to study. Don’t act too smart your teacher told me that you are smart at studies. Why don't you study? Why don't you understand me? I don’t want to study that’s it. Hey what is your argument? am able to here till the end of our street? She don’t want to study it seems See she is throwing the books into fire. What is all this Ammulu? What happenend? Did anyone say anything at school? No Basava. I don’t want to study. Why? Did I ask you to join me in school? You joined me in school. Now I don’t want to study. Dad. Dad she won’t listen to us now. Leave her. Let her do whatever she likes.. It's a lie that you don't want to study. Tell me the reason. Nothing uncle. I won't force you to school. I won't speak a word on it. But please tell me the truth. What happened dear? Even though you don't disclose, I'm aware of your situation uncle. You joined a girl in our school. Ammulu. Yes sir. Who is she? She is my sister's daughter. What happened sir? Nothing muniyya. Amulu is very clever, and intelligent than her classmates. she will reach heights, if you continue her studies. I called to inform this to you so that you'll make financial arrangements for studies. Be careful. Ok sir. G-A-N-G. Dear son. Come here. What dad? I do not understand how to say. About what dad? Hope you will understand me. Your fees is also increasing along with your age. But, my income didn't increase. That's why I decided. I can afford to educate only one between you both. She is cleverer than you so. I decided to make her study further. You need to go to work, my son. As you wish dad. In this situation Basava should study further uncle. Ammulu. Basava. I prepare your favourite food in the evening. Come fast. Okay. I have a doubt, why do you keep money in his pocket daily. Ladies should have bindis. Gents pockets should be full of money. Then only they'll get respect from others. Is he a daily labour like us? He is educated, and he will have lot of expenses. This interview is just for name sake Basava. You cleared the exam. You almost got the job. But there's a small problem. What is that? The interviewer expects bribe, Even though you answer all questions correct, he'll reject you. If you bribe him, he'll select you. Think about it. 24-25-26-27. This is 4000/- And 3000/- In total? Total 10000/- Still how much is required? 15000/- uncle. 15000! Then how now? I can adjust 5000/- uncle. Still we need 10000/- Shall we take hand loan from anyone? Who will give hand loan to a cobbler? Don’t feel bad Basava. No I got habituated to all these Ammulu. Everytime I dream of something it's collapsed. Ours eyes are only meant for crying. Not for dreaming. Ok leave about that job..... Let it go Hey basava. Are you still sleeping. Get up now. What.. Will you be with this beard and all even after getting the job? Don’t irritate me with your jokes. Speak now. From where did you get this money? Leave about that and pay for your job. I won't pay until you tell me. You won’t listen to me. I took hand loan. We need to pay monthly interest. And you'll clear after getting the job. Take this dear. You are lucky Basava, You will get the govt job. You'll get your joining letter in 6 months. Meanwhile complete the pending works at your place. Eat dear. You are habituated to home food. How will you manage with hotel food after going to city? Hence I saw a good alliance for you. She is our relative and.. They'll give dowry too. I like that girl. But I don't like. What? How can you say that even before seeing her? I will say the same even after seeing her. Why so? What? Why won't you like the girl I set for you? Answer me. Are you nuts Dad? Don't you have conscience? Why so many big words now? Then.. Ammulu sacrificed so many things since childhood for my welfare. She changed her likes and got habituated to hardships. She even left her studies. Even my mother won't do these many things for me. Even now, she is sacrificing her love for my welfare I'm staying put as I don't know how to express my love to her. Now, I revealed as I may not get a chance to express again. You didn't adjust the money, She gave you. Do you know how she got the money? She mortgaged her mother's memory Please take this chain and give me 15000/- bucks. What dear, do I look like a pawn broker? To mortgage this chain for money. I will give it to you, Raju.. No sir, You are a great person to give me money, but I don't like to take it. Please mortgage this and give me money. My Basava will get the job. You're a stubborn one, Ok give it to me. It's a sin to marry another girl for dowry, by leaving our Ammulu like that. Why did you bring another alliance, instead of our Ammulu? You just need a companion for me. I will only marry Ammulu. Hell with the allaince. -Son Dear. Have this food dear Stop crying and have dinner Ammulu its already late dear. Why didn’t you didn't tell me that you love Ammulu? I didn't find the right situation. Hey uncle is coming. You guys are here! Why did you come here in this heat dad? I couldn't sleep after our discussion son. Ammulu is the right companion for you. Shall I fix marriage date dear? As you wish dad. My wife likes you a lot dear. if she's alive, She might have conducted your marriage in a grand way Take this as your maiden gift. You have another gift too. Finally you got the govt job, when are you joining? Six months more sir, I want to work in your farm in the mean time. Ammulu, mortgaged her chain with you, take the wage you will pay for me and clear the debt. Why about all those now? I'll give you the chain She will feel bad, if I take the chain without paying money. You both are the same. Basava From when will you join your duty? From day after tomorrow. No need Complete all the rituals and join. Ok sir -Take care of Ammulu. Very happy sir. The sound of bangles. Fragrance of the tuberose And the quarrel of lily, Everything is for you Fragrance of jasmine, And the hibiscus' sandal These are the witness of our love The melting moon light is also a witness And our desires are the reason My nupital chain raises for your looks And my desire raises with your touch My nupital chain raises for your looks And my desire raises with your touch Shall I build a fort with all my dreams and wishes?

Shall we see the farm. Amulu did you have your dinner. Yeah. What are you thinking? They are looking weird to me. Are they really workers? How will the people who roam different villages be?

You are the legal heir for this quary and farm from today. You are asking for a raise in your salary right. Chakravarthi sir is not only my father in law. But also he's like a god to me. As he wish's. From today I'm increasing you daily wage to 600 bucks. [sloganeering] I will take care of you all. I'll look after his absence. Seshu, Let's move. Madam. Who are you? What do you want? I'm Sudharshan from the nearby village Vellanki. We lost everything in the recent floods ma'am. People are facing problems with out houses. We even raised our concern to the MLA. But, there's no response. Your family is has a lot of influence. If your father talks to them, it'll be done. Why to involve my father in this? Give me a minute. Madam, we all got houses because of you. -What is this, Sudharshan? It's a small help. It may be a small thing to you, but I'll use you to reach my goal. Only because of you. You did all this when I asked you to do. You are my godess ma'am. Dad. I know you are angry dad. But please understand me. Sudharshan is very good person. He is educated and intelligent too. Father. Please look at me. I'm talking to you, Dad. Please dad. Father. Please dad talk to.. Eswari, He's angry. Let's come and talk to him later. No, it's like. Come. My daughter married this idiot I accepted you as my daughter loved you. But, you are growing weed in my family's heritage land. Uncle. That land is only giving mangoes but not money. Just do what am doing you will get good returns. Shut up. Don’t talk again. If you come again with such stupid plans. I will send you to jail and. I will get my daughter remarried. You called us after a long time. You should do a murder. Bro. We reached home. It's been many days since I saw you this happy. Is every property on your name? Are papers clear? Yes, everything is clear. You acted like an innocent and killed my father, for these documents! What are you talking Eshwari? Why will I kill your father? Don’t act smart sudharshan. Don’t act. How did you know? When my father didn't answer my calls, I came to Basava's house. Ammulu. Sister... Why are you here? I came to know that dad is here It's my birthday today. Is it? He used to be with me every year. But this year he is not talking to me. So I came to see him once. He forgot his phone. I'm going to give him, You arrived at same time, let’s go together. I would not believed about your deeds if someone else have told me so. Father. Hey. You'll get me arrested. And send me to jail Even the jail walls can't stop me. Father. Father. Ammulu, father. Ammulu.. Sudharshan killed my father. Sister,listen to me. Sister. If they see us, they'll kill us At least one of us must stay alive to tell the truth. You go away. Go. Oh, you have seen everything! But you acted well as if you don't know anything. Yes I have killed your father. Will kill you now as you know the truth. Who will stop me? Basava! I know how eager you are to kill him. Even am so. But our enemy is very powerful than us. We have to be wise If we do any mistake our enemy will get saved. They should know why they are dying. And know why we are killing them. You are my weapon Basava. Our enemy should get scared with the steps we take. I went against my father to marry you. But you gave me my father’s death as a gift on my birthday. I was not able to bear that Sudharshan. I fixed the time for your death then onwards. Basava. How are you able to know our plans Basava? I have diverted you from Basava. Can you expect the loss, if they don't work for us for a single day? Consider this like a fight between two individuals, not two communities. Sir. Ammulu is like my sister, Sudharshan. We have done here marriage. Did you forget? You've ruined the life of two happy couple. What punishment should you get? Punishment... To me? Do you know with whom you are speaking to? Sudharshan. Sudh... Do you think that, I'll hide the poison in my throat, as I'm named as Eswari? I have mixed some of that in your coffee. Sai bro. Do you remember him? He's the father of Nani, whom you killed in your childhood. You? Sins are like boomerang. All the sins you committed returned to you. Eshwari. The snake will vomit poison, even though you pamper it It's nature's law. Lion always eats meat, even though you pet it. You loved me. And you got fooled, That's not my fault. Cruelty is my religion. I'm bounded to it since childhood. Is it wrong? You're right. I came to know that even some people behave like wild animals. People like you may get acquitted by law, but in nature's eyes you will be punished. The war which was done by Eshwari, with help of Basava.. all was being numb and witnessed by the five elements and Lord Shiva word
