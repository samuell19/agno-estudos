The express train to Kagoshima is entering the station... No luck. The train is full. Maybe they got on the train in Tokyo. They must have found a seat. Kawamoto and...? Leave them alone, they must have had a hard time finding a seat. Is Ogaki the next station? No, it's Gifu. Today, it will be hot again. Are you getting off? Yes, in Kyoto. Shimooka, go and take a seat. Wonderful! Are you coming from Yokohama? You must be tired. Have you found a place? A couple of wagons back. Hiroshima. Hiroshima station. Hey, a bottle. Hey, some wine! Mitajiri, Daido, Yotsuji... then you get off. The two of you still have a long way to go. - Be careful. - Goodbye. STRAITS BETWEEN SHIMONOSEKI AND MOJI Next stop, Tosa... CITY OF SAGA METROPOLITAN POLICE - DETECTIVES SHIMOOKA AND YUKI Pleased to meet you. Please, have a seat. It must have been a hell of a trip. The captain called us and gave us all the information. We're ready to give you all the assistance you need. Thank you. Maybe we'll need your help later on... but we'll manage alone for the time being. YOKOGAWA'S - This is what we need. - Yes, it's perfect. HOTEL BIZENYA It's too expensive. But I'm giving you our best room and three meals a day. But we'll only stay for 4 or 5 days, maybe a week. Well... I'll give you a rebate of 50 yen, so it's 650 yen. Do you want to eat something? We already ate. We won't go out today. Just make yourselves at home. The bath will be ready at 6. This place is perfect. That's a good spot; nobody can see you. It will be hot! Well, the stakeout has begun. HARIKOMI Shimooka... She looks old for her age. Mom, I'm hungry. He must be the younger son... Tei, come and play. I think her stepchildren love her. It seems a peaceful house. Ishii's not arrived yet. We're back! More kids... Welcome back. Kids back from school. Lunch. I'm going to take a look around. Don't come back late. The older kid must love her too. She's going out to buy something for dinner. Cigarettes. She spent 80 yen on some fish and vegetables. The husband likes to drink. Yes, she bought some wine. Welcome back. Welcome back! He must be her husband. Right... Hey, a new face! The bath is ready. Are you taking it together? I'll take it later. Would you like some wine with your dinner? If it's possible. No, I think we'd better not drink tonight. When did you fill the tub? At noon. I told you to fill it in the morning, to use less coal. Yes. Nice bath... I left the soap there for you. It doesn't make sense. I mean... that woman seems reserved, more mature than her age. An ordinary woman. You could say that of many people. Who knows... What if she were involved with a murdering thief? There's no helping it. A wrong move and you're done for. You're right. But it's hard to arrest someone in front of his own son. I'm so relieved. Son, I'm taking you to Kamakura. You always say that. I promise you. And Yuki will come with us. Thanks, but... Swimming is nice, but what have you decided regarding...? Actually, I don't know. These have been two embarrassing months. Aren't you interested in the public bath business? Your profession won't be affected by it. You have to make a final decision. Stop beating around the bush. Come in. What happened? The Fukagawa police called. What happened? He's at the Mikawaya pawn shop... I'll be going with Shimooka. Get in touch with the police in Takecho for me. - You said Yuki? - That's right. I told you that dad's promises are unreliable. MIKAWAYA PAWN SHOP We've come from the police station. Everybody's working. How was he killed? A shot to the heart, entering from behind. It's a calibre 32. One shot was enough to kill him. Take a close-up of the bullet mark. PAWN SHOP KILLER ARRESTED YAMADA CONFESSES TO THE MURDER Did you throw it away? Where? So, where's the gun? Confess! Did your partner take it? Don't lie. This is too big a job to have carried out alone. Wait one more week. Give him ten days. I might as well confess. After all, it was my idea. My partner didn't do much, I had to cover him. But I'll feel better if I confess. Is he holding the gun now? I gave it to him. We used to work together. His name is Kyuichi Ishii. Business is pretty slow around here. What's your business? Engines... for machinery. What company do you work for? Yamasawa, in Tokyo. I've never heard of it. We're known mostly in the North. Now we're starting to expand around here. Do you have a cheap one that you could sell to me? I need it for the cob cutter. I'm sorry. Our engines are too small for that kind of work. Dinner was good. It's so hot... It's our second day. Sadako! Did you water the flowers? When will you learn to do as I tell you? I'm sorry. This is for today. Bye. Goodbye. The husband is going to work at the bank. She's done with her house cleaning now. It took her two hours. She's very scrupulous in her work. The old man gets easily excited. He always shows a fishlike mug. He'll get in touch with her by mail or telegram... Or by phone. But they don't have a phone. He might call her at a neighbour's house. But our best guess is by mail. I'm going. I'm going out. I changed my mind. It's too hot. I'll go out after my afternoon nap. It's not even noon? Then it's a morning nap. Why is it so hot this year? Shimooka... Do you think Ishii will show up? Ishii is a cool kind of guy, he hates Tokyo. - And he has TBC. - Tuberculosis? He was feeling down and he missed home. He had a hard time putting the money together for the ticket to Yamaguchi. It should have been easy. Wasn't he working? Not exactly. He had no fixed job. Just enough to support himself. He must have earned enough for a ticket by now. He was always thinking about a certain woman. One he'd left in his hometown 3 years before. I asked him what had happened to her. She got married and now she lives in Kyushu. He told me he knew her address. The children are back. You must be hungry. There are some noodles ready. Hurry up and eat. And do your homework afterwards. What about your promise? About the baseball. Didn't you ask dad? I lost it, I need another one. I'll ask him today. That's what you always say. On the surface she seems calm, but she's troubled. They're registered as salesmen. The registry is no evidence. You're suspicious of everyone. Salesmen don't sleep all day long, unless they're fakes. Excuse me... Come in. How hot it is! Please, sit down. I'm sorry to bother you... but the person in charge of postal savings has come by. And I forgot to ask my husband... I'll pay for the sewing work you're performing for us. Can you give me 300 yen? Thank you very much. Holy cow, it's hot! Why, she's cute... She's a neighbour. She's pretty and kind. I mean, she's too refined for Yokogawa. Why too refined? Her husband is real stingy. He gives her only 100 yen per day. He doesn't even want her to touch his wallet. As soon as she arrived, he locked the cupboard. And he weighed the rice every day. Enough with the gossip. Go back to work. Are you going out? No, I'd like a glass of water. It's so hot! Kiwako, bring some fresh water. Bring some ice too. Please, help yourself. Doing nothing must be pretty boring. Our sample engine hasn't arrived yet. We can't leave, even though our business is poor without our samples. Oh, you have guests. She came here to borrow 300 yen. I've heard that it's for some postal savings. That miser is giving her only 100 yen a day. Nobody showed up today. It's true. Take some ice. There are some guests in the next room. A couple. How can they resist opening their windows, with this heat? Yours is big. Yours is bigger. No, yours is bigger. Is it already 2:30 PM? It's all quiet. The children got back 20 minutes ago, nobody else. There's nobody around. Everybody's taking a nap. Time to go shopping. It's 4 PM, same time as yesterday. Thank you. She's a stepmother, her husband is 20 years older than her, she has 3 stepchildren... Only 100 yen to buy things every day. She's too pale. She has no sparkle inside. How can she get by? The usual stuff. One litre, right? Whatever the scenario might be... I just can't believe that woman has another relationship on the side. And even if she did have one... I don't think it could be a desperate killer running after her. We can't say yet. We have to wait and see. You know... I'm starting to think that we should have searched more thoroughly in Tokyo. Yes, he worked here. But he was a bum. He worked here 3 years ago. Have you seen him around lately? He owes me some money; it's hard to get in touch with him. I haven't seen him since he left. How did he find this job? He was sent by the employment agency. When did Ishii leave this job? It was cold; I think it was February. Have you seen him again since then? Never. Has he done anything wrong? We hired him to test him out, but he seemed too weak. I'd like to take a look at one of his pictures. Haven't you got any in your archive? As you can see, this is a small business... He had no girlfriend, he was very precise in his work. But he was a little too old to be employed as an apprentice. He couldn't donate his blood. I'd rather say he needed some. How was his health according to the medical examinations? Terrible. He didn't stop in Tokyo. I have the feeling he went to Kyushu to visit that woman. CENTRAL INVESTIGATION STATION Here's a report from his hometown. And a picture. His history with that woman is told in detail... There's his address too. We present to you "Music from Tokyo"... Come and sit with us... The concert hall is very crowded... Koichi Aoki will sing "Come soon to me"... I'll call your friend. He'd rather read than listen to the radio. But you're not reading - come downstairs and listen to the music. I can hear it from here too. I'd rather stay here; it's cooler. You're strange. You can't hear the music from here. I guess you're thinking about someone. Thinking about someone... Why don't you want to get married? If it doesn't work between us, I'll give you your freedom back. Listen... If there's another one, I won't give you any trouble. I'm just a poor cop. Don't lie. I know about the girl at the public baths. It's hot. It gets cooler after 9. It's only our second day. We can still wait. Third day, nothing to report: Today is our fourth day. Every day the same story. At 7:30, the children go to school. At 8:20... The postman. No need to worry, they paid five days in advance. But today's their fourth day here. They're just bums. Do you remember what the news report said? 1 million yen was stolen from that loan company. Three people were responsible for it. Maybe they had an argument about the money and one of them was killed. We'd better report them, they look suspicious. This curry is very hot. Shimooka... We're going out. I'll buy you a present. Thank you. Anyone else without a ticket? 40-50 yen change for a 100 yen bill... Tickets, please. We're making our minds up, come back later. What will we do if he shows up? - I don't know yet. - Remember, he's got a gun. Next stop: Omachi Bridge. Shimooka, there we go. Cigarettes. Where's the phone? When is the next bus coming? At 2:11 PM. - And then at 3:25 PM. - Thank you very much. Unusual place for a date. Of all things, a funeral! I think she cheated us. He left her 3 years ago and she got married... I don't think he'll go back to her. She's the only woman he knows. It's a possibility. I think he'd rather return to his hometown. I don't think he's interested in her. Anyway, we'll send some men to his hometown. Yamada said that Ishii has something like 30-40,000 yen. He'll use the money, and he's got a gun. He might commit suicide. Suicide? He arrived in Tokyo 3 years ago. Things didn't turn out well for him. He's sick, nervous and depressed. He could commit other crimes, but chances are high for him to commit suicide. I think he'll get in touch with the woman while he's got the money. Wait a minute... She could meet someone at the funeral. We can't let her out of sight. She's taking them to the old man. The rain will make the temperature drop tonight. The rain stopped right when she arrived at the bank. She turned around and went back. Poor married women. It's not that bad. Women have more patience than men, they can endure any sort of deprivation. They can endure huge loads of work without getting tired. Sure, it depends, but a woman can really endure any sort of deprivation. It depends. What's your weight? 70 kg. You lost one kg. The razor blade, please. For you. A ticket for the movie theatre? If you don't show up I'll get mad. He's engaged, don't force him. Look who's there: Yuki... Come with me. Try to understand. You can work hard and still not have enough money to buy a house. At least, that's what happens to poor detectives. Remember, Yuki... I'm not trying to force you to marry her. I know. If you don't like her, just say so. I have to give an answer. I'm getting a little embarrassed by this whole story. Should I say that you refuse? I'm turning the light off. Wake me up at 2. What a noisy bunch. What a mob. They'll keep on going all night long. How noisy! Can't complain. It's not that bad. There are times when you can't even take a nap. It's true. Like that time at the graveyard, or that cold night under the bridge, or when you're in the rain. Next year will be your 20th year of service in the police, right? Think about it, 20 years... You must have seen all kinds of situations. That's for sure. Today is our 6th day. 7. 30: The children go to school. 8. 20: Her dear husband goes to work. Then she starts cleaning, washing, sewing. I beg your pardon. I'm Sasaki from the Saga police. Are you detectives Shimooka and Yuki? That's right. The hotel owner kept on calling us. She thinks you are suspects. I had to come here to investigate. We're sorry about the trouble. Have a seat. We're undercover. For security reasons. Anyway, they seem favourably disposed. We thought they'd let some information slip through. But they're not easily deceived. Wait... They'd better go on making guesses. - You could make up something for them. - Sure. It must be really hard to stay here. - This heat is unbearable. - It's your 6th day here, isn't it? Call the central station for us. Tell them there's no sign of the suspect. Just a moment... Don't let anything leak to the newspapers. The woman is innocent. The newspaper would ruin her and her family. The chief warned me about it too. Thank you very much. You surprised him. You took that woman's side. I see her every day and I feel sorry for her. I didn't care at first. But little by little... I started sympathizing with her. They're here to sell a new engine. They're waiting for a shipment. Is that right? There's nothing suspicious. Some water, please. I'm sorry I suspected innocent people. Don't worry, they don't know anything about it. Kiwako, bring 2 ice-creams! Not for you... A celebration... It doesn't concern us. Will we take the night train to go back? Tomorrow we'll call the central station and we'll make a decision. I hope we'll find a seat this time. Please, come in. There are no maids, that's why I came myself. Is it 'on the house' or should we pay? Sure, it's on the house. I just wanted to be sure. The service has improved this afternoon. The laundry, the ironing and this is the cherry on top. When someone's travelling, he needs to be treated kindly. And I do my part. There's no hotel like this. We appreciate your hospitality. Yuki, take it. I'm sorry for your wives. You must always be on the road. Maybe they're used to it, but they must still worry. Your wife must be very young. He's not married yet. Really? He isn't yet? He must look forward to it. It's hard. I know. But they will give us 50,000 yen to leave. That's not the point. We're paying the rent. - Arguing is useless. - I'm not arguing. We haven't enough money to buy this house. Besides, we'll get paid for leaving it. Get paid for leaving it? Did you accept? No, not yet. What will become of us? An apartment will be enough for us. I went to see one today. There are only six mats, but it's clean and comfortable. You mean we'll be crammed together in one room? With the furniture? It'll be tight, but anyway you... You mean I'll get married? So there'll be one less. Will you manage without my income? I've had some serious marriage proposals. But I've postponed it for too long. What else can I do? I accept not getting a dowry. And having to work after getting married. But asking me to send you my income as well... that's too much. I won't be a parasite. Is your father back? Is he always this late? Is it normal? Yes, but this time he promised. - Promised what? - To take me swimming. I think we were wrong. No news from the Yamaguchi team either. Don't worry. If they ask us to continue... the Saga police will give us some money in advance. The time's up. They'll ask us to go back. I'll get a report about Yamaguchi. It's still hot. Come and play with us. What game? There's nothing to do, my friend. She has only 100 yen a day. Isn't it too early for her to go shopping? And she has no bag. That umbrella seller... I'm sure he was Ishii's contact. The train for the countryside leaves at 10:09. Let's see... the train that comes back leaves at 10:25. Good, no train has left since she went out. Calm down... Yes, they took a bus. They took the bus to Higashi Taku. The person who was with her made her take the apron off. - Was she with a man? - Yes. He had no jacket... and was carrying a brown suitcase. Is this the man? I think so. Which destination did they choose? When will they get to Higashi Taku? At 12:50. We'll reach them in half an hour. - What's going on? - Dynamite. You have to wait. Tell them we're in a hurry. Too late. They're about to start. Ready! It's dangerous. Let's find a shelter. Come on, let's give them a hand. Did you see another bus pass by? - 20 minutes ago. - Thanks. Let's go. I'm sorry, we lost them. We wasted too much time with the explosion. I'm a detective. Have you seen this man on the bus, with a woman? Did they get off here? - No, at Kusakari. - Kusakari? - Yes. 5 stops before this one. - Where? - At the spa. The spa at Hozenji is close to Kusakari. A passenger teased them when they got off the bus. Everybody started laughing. They're at the Hozenji spa. Call Shimooka at the hotel. Directly from Saga? Okay, thanks. She didn't come here of her own free will. Ishii must be desperate. They could kill themselves together. That shot... He must have killed the woman. And Ishii? Come here, come here! I'm sorry. Have you seen a young couple around? The man wearing no jacket, the woman with no sandals. My badge. We met them down there. They were on the river bank. Take the road on the right and you'll get there. I must stop him quickly. 23,000 yen is a good salary. And the children seem to love me. It looks like we're doing good. I'm happy to hear it. When are you leaving? After I go to Yamaguchi and Tokyo. Okinawa... it seems so long ago. I can't do anything about it; it's my job. After 3 years, I can come back as a technician. You'll stay in Tokyo then? There's more work there. Then you'll get married to a nice girl... Well, I don't know. They seem so happy. It doesn't look like they want to kill themselves. If she's not in danger, there's no need to arrest him now. Easy... Remember: He's got a gun. I'll wait for the police squad. She seems as happy as a child. Did you meet a couple going that way? Didn't you see them? I saw nobody. They must have turned off here. Are you really going to Okinawa? Are you serious? Sure. It's not true, you're lying. And I thought she was calm and cold... You have a family now. Let's forget everything. I don't want to. Remember 3 years ago... I've been keeping an eye on her for a week. She seems someone else now. That memory is driving me crazy... And it's making me sad. I wasn't able to stop you. Things don't always go as you expect them to. If only I hadn't left for Tokyo. It's easy to say that now. Now it's too late. Now it's too late for anything. Everything's over. But, Sadako... If you wanted to... when I left to go to Tokyo, you could have come with me. It's true. Maybe you wouldn't have left if I had been more determined. It should have been an easy decision to make. In both cases, if you had stayed... or if I had come with you. It should have been. Forgive me. I'll tell you how I really feel. Even if we had separated... I thought I could get by on my own. I felt sad. But I'm older than you, so I thought I could find someone to marry. But I was wrong. I shouldn't have thought so. Now I'm paying the consequences. I'm finished. I lied to you. I'm not happily married. It may seem so. And I try to commit myself to it. But... nothing goes right. I feel tired and useless. I have no purpose in life. That's the way I feel. Let's talk about Tokyo. Tokyo is a big city. With rows of huge buildings. At night, you can see the neon lights twinkle. It's crammed with trains and cars and there's a subway. Are full of anything you might wish for. I worked there for 3 years. I liked it there. It was the right place for me. I'm not going back home. This time I won't leave you. I'll endure any sort of deprivation or suffering... take me with you. Please... Things have changed. What has changed? Now you're married. I'll leave Yokogawa. I want to start a new life. - It's a gamble. - A gamble? What do you mean? It's impossible. I'll tell you why. I'll tell you everything. Let's go to a hotel; we'll talk there. Nothing could make me change my mind. Good work! They went to that hotel. High class, isn't it? The woman is not involved. I'll take care of her. Follow me. They're taking a bath. This is the room. Let's check their stuff. No gun. Maybe he took it with him. Shall we wait for him here? There. He's waiting. Hey, Ishii! You're under arrest. Here's the warrant. Where's the gun? I sold it in Osaka. Madam... Ishii will be held by the police. You'd better go home. Hurry, you don't have much time. What did Ishii do? There... thanks. You'll be home before your husband. The bus leaves in fifteen minutes. I'll pay for the hotel. Here's the bus ticket. She had her adventure for a couple of hours. Tonight, she'll be back with her husband and step-children. She'll be the same woman again. Dull, ordinary and devoted to sewing. Three tickets to Tokyo. What's he doing? A telegram, please. YUMIKO TAKAKURA c/o LOCAL OFFICE OF TAITO Yumiko, I need you. Don't let your family get in your way. Now I understand. LET'S GET MARRIED WHEN I RETURN We had to leave many reporters behind on our way here. So we took the train at the Yokohama station. We had to stand up all night long. Your ticket. What's done is done. You need a new beginning now. Passengers leaving at 10:40 on the express train to Tokyo, please go to the platform. - Well, goodbye. - I'll come with you. You can always start over. The train will stop at the following stations: Tosu, Nogata... You're still young: Don't lose hope. ...Okuyama... Hiroshima... Onoguchi... Kobe... Osaka... Kyoto...
