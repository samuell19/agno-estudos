(mechanical music) (cheerful orchestral music) (impactful orchestral music) (soft orchestral music) (whimsical music) [Narrator] Distances are great down under the Equator. The vast beaches of the Pacific hide countless islands off the old shipping lane away from the world. Nights are warm there. Native songs are soft magic. A man's life could run so slowly, so easily in this strange paradise. That's the way it was. (soft operatic music) (men clapping) Oh that was wonderful, Mrs Bowman. Kiddo, you got any gals around the island? - Gals? - Yeah, you know, skirts. # Da da da da No, no more dancing girls. My mama died; dead long time. Aah, you poor kid. Maui no poor, Maui pretty quick rich. Maui own seven coconut trees. Also Maui adopt big boss fellow David. Gots lots of money. (chuckles) A capitalist, eh? Well, pardon me. (door knocking) Come in. Yes? - Ship reports at 10:30, sir. - Carry on. I suppose that means you must go. Please, won't you stay just a little while longer? You see, we so rarely have guests on this little island. Sorry Mrs Bowman, but I'm afraid we really must be going. Can't I bribe you? Before you go, would you at least have another cup of coffee or a beer, perhaps a bourbon? Oh, I'm bribed. I sure could go for another piece of that apple pie. (both laughing) And I would like another cup of that delicious coffee. Oh wonderful, it won't take a minute. By the way Mrs Bowman, tell me how down in the South Sea you ever learned the art of making an old-fashioned New England apple pie. Why in New England, from my mother. You see, although I am 1/4th Japanese and 1/4th Hispanic, I'm also 1/2 American. Well in my book, you're 5/4th swell. (everyone laughing) Mr Bailey has managed to blush, I hope. Yes sir. I think that was a very nice blush, Ensign Bailey and a very nice compliment. Now if this crisis has passed, let (mumbles) go to the kitchen and make some coffee, shall we? David, why don't you show Captain Morgan your telescope? Captain Morgan, David has the most wonderful telescope. What is it, 12 inch refractor (mumbles)? Well anyway, it's a wonderful instrument. Come on while they're stargazing, let's go make some coffee. Oh wonderful. 12 inch refractor, that's no plaything. - [Man On Radio] (mumbles) DCD calling the Claw. Come in the Claw. (mumbles) X-10 DCD, calling the Claw. Come in the Claw. Will you pardon me a minute? It's the trading post calling. I won't keep you a moment. [Morgan] That's perfectly alright. (mumbles), go ahead. [Man On Radio] The plate's for camera. The rice, potatoes and coffee. You will get after great delay. Three sing song house girl bribes (mumbles) Captain, take them Tahiti. Very sorry David, goodbye. I suppose that sort of thing is always happening. Yes, quite often. Down here in the islands, you have to have patience. I've learned that. I've got it. Now I know who you are. I've seen your name in print a number of times. I remember an astronomical volume, Island Universes. Yes, that was the title! Why you are the famous David Bowman, aren't you? No Captain, I'm the ne'er-do-well David Bowman Jr, very junior. My father was a great name in astronomy, great man. I tried to follow in his footsteps, but his stride was too long for me. Come now, aren't you being a little unfair to yourself? I had a theory once, a big theory. I meant to track it down and prove it as true. Truth. Now I have six bourbons and look at the moon. Well, lets look at it. You first, Captain. At this time of the year, the moon's at its best. The atmospheric conditions in the islands now are most favorable for astronomical study. Why this is amazing. - Have a drink? - No, thank you. Why it's a complete laboratory. Yes, it's quite complete. My father installed it here years ago. Well Captain, there's your moon. Tonight you can almost reach out and touch it. This is remarkably clear. I've seen dead things, but never anything as dead as that. Unless perhaps... The moon and I have much in common. Of course I always have my six bourbons to provide that essential inner fire. You're sweet. Now Ensign, won't you tell me about your work? It sounds fascinating to me. Oh it wouldn't be of any interest to you, honest it wouldn't. Oh, but it would. What about this directional thing you're looking for? What is it? Well, I guess you'd call it one of the most dangerous weapons of modern warfare. It's a directional shortwave transmitter. You see, they're the babies that have been guiding their Jap subs and bombers straight to our convoys. That's why our men searched this island and your house. You see, we feel sure that at least four of these transmitters are scattered in this Pacific, and believe me, we're gonna find them. But it's a tough job. You see, anybody can locate a little set like yours, but not this directional baby. It's got special antenna that shoots a radio beam right where you want it. Not just broadcast it to the whole cockeyed world. Look Mrs Bowman, lemme show you how it works. Alright, use this. (Ensign clearing throat) Here. Now suppose this is the horizon of the earth. It's getting smaller every day. Now this is the transmitter A. It shoots a beam like a searchlight or artillery gun up at an angle and strikes what we call the heavy-side layer of gases in the stratosphere. Because of electrical laws, the beam is reflected back down to Earth at a given, but distant point B. All in between is blank, no waves come down. So it's all around, hidden close in silence? Not a peep. It's a tough nut to crack. The Japs'll sit out there on one of these little islands and put the finger on us. No matter how careful we are to stay beyond the range of their observation planes, we still get hit. Tell me Ensign, do you have many more of these islands to search? It all sounds horrible and terrifying to me. It's not that bad, Mrs Bowman. Tonight we go to Manihiki. Where we go from there is unpredictable. I shouldn't have told you that. I must be crazy. Please Mrs Bowman, you won't repeat that to anyone? Repeat what? About us going to Manihiki. I shouldn't have told you that. I must be crazy. That's a Navy secret. You don't tell those things even to your own mother! Oh please Mrs Bowman, it's not that I don't trust you. But I don't understand my saying a thing like that. I know better than to say a thing like... What's that? [Mrs Bowman] Oh, that's nothing. I installed a regenerating system. Every once in a while, it seems to get tired, but it will be alright in a moment. David, David. [David] Yes I know love, it's the generator again. I'm looking for the flashlight. Do you know where it is? [Mrs Bowman] Yes, I saw it on the table there by the window. Oh I'll get it. Oh, there they are now. (door knocking) Come in. - Yes? - Captain Morgan, you're wanted on board, sir. Radio standing by from Commander Wilson. Carry on. Good day, sir. (mumbles) we're leaving. Aye aye, sir. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs Bowman. Thanks for a wonderful evening and the apple pie. Goodnight, Ensign. If I had the faintest idea of your destination, I'd take one and send it to you. But as I possess one of your Navy secrets... (sighs) Mrs Bowman, you're... - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Ensign. Goodnight Mr Bowman, thanks for everything. Goodnight. Thanks again both of you for a lovely evening. Again, accept my apology for having to search your house. (Mrs Bowman mumbling) - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Captain. Goodbye. (muffled speech) You've been acting kinda funny all evening or is that just my imagination? (mumbles) unhappy. Life's gone wrong with him. Marrying (mumbles) that way's no good. He's on the beach same as any other veteran tango tango. Only he's on the beach in a clean shirt. (engine rumbling) They're gone. Yes, in one hour (mumbles). You are both very (mumbles). I would suggest however, David, that in future occasion of this kind, you would show a little more affection for my wife. You may go to bed, Loti. Goodnight, Matsuru San. Goodnight. I'm sorry for you, David. You show no sign of relaxing in this unfortunate position. I'm unhappy for you. And I show even less any sign of the courage to kill you. That makes me unhappy. (Matsuru speaking Japanese) (speaking Japanese) Ensign Bailey spoke the truth. The destroyer is bound for Manihiki. (item banging) You think I'm a weakling, a fool and a drunkard! You think you got me licked! Well you're wrong, Matsuru! Wrong, wrong wrong! I say you're wrong! What is it? (Matsuru speaking Japanese) (speaking Japanese) (mumbles) Manihiki. (speaking Japanese) (signal beeping loudly) (dramatic music) (speaking Japanese) (plane engines roaring) (speaking Japanese) (plane engines roaring) David, David. Hmm? (airplane engine roaring) Oh, I've been asleep. It's late. A little after 12. What's that? (voices drowned out by engine roaring) That research included your father's esteemed books. David, no supernova has ever been charted in the Trevino region, if you having last flight. - No? - No. You've found a new star David, just bursting into life. I'll help you (mumbles) case later and you can mail a report to the societies. That will be good. That'll be great. I shall protect the (mumbles) lab for you, David. But I know, I understand. I should have forseen when we took over this island of yours and your house, that the duration of war with America would breed patriotism. But you are not really patriotic, David. You'd have (mumbles), you should be patriotic. Like your father, you are intrinsically against war and because you can't be against war and be patriotic at the same time, a great battle rages in your conscience. It is a completely unnecessary battle. You must only use your intentions to put your conscience at ease. Trying to hate me, trying to be patriotic. Under these circumstances, it's like the useless beating of wings for a bird in a cage. You're a helpless prisoner here, David. Once you were my best student. No one would (mumbles) more than you did. You used to believe in the things I told you. Believe me now that you'll be much happier. I say to you as your teacher, David, be logical. Say to your conscience, yes, I am patriotic but I can do nothing about it. So why should I not enjoy this island? Come David, be logical. Let you and I find our constellations and wisdom in the skies. (mumbles), David. Your new star is (mumbles). I'll find it for you. No, you'll find it yourself. Come on, David. I'll (mumbles). Come. (soft soothing music) So, are you all ready David? Are the setting circles correct? Yes, David. [David] Got the readings (mumbles) from right ascension. A sky full of stars and bombers. I guess all over the world now if anybody looks up at the stars, they think bombers. Looks like we're gettin' out of this (mumbles) just in time. Sure hope those babies don't get it in their heads to bomb us. They won't bomb us, we ain't worth it. Anyway, I don't care. Gimme a drink. You got it. Thanks. Hey, what's that little greaseball of a skipper doin'? We're headin' into shore. What's he stoppin' here for? For me, because the way I'm leaving you (mumbles). Hey skipper, (mumbles)? [Skipper] Be ready in five minutes. What's the idea? Ain't you goin' to Tahiti with us? Yeah, what's so much on Niccolo? A guy lives there. Sort of a gentleman I guess you'd call him. Here, hold this for me will you Edie? No foolin' kids, he is a good one. Anyway, I don't wanna go to Tahiti. I wanna go home. Back to the United States. There's only one way I know how to get there. This guy. He's got money and he's got a boat. Every day you become more vain. More American in your character. (mumbles) tough there's a duration of yourself. You displease me very much. Yes, Matsuru San. - [Woman] (mumbles) I'm a little tired. - Shut up! - Take your hands off me! (door knocking) (Marine speaking Japanese) (muffled shouting) Will you shut up? (feet shuffling) (door knocking) Matsuru Sama! Matsuru Sama! David Bowman does live here, all I wanna do is see him, understand? Will you shut up? Okay, I won't talk for a week. (Japanese crosstalk) David. David. Huh? David, there's a young lady to see you. Ooh go. The guards just caught the girl. She just came ashore from the (mumbles). [David] Hello. Hello. You don't remember me, do you? Toni Chase? Well, I'm half asleep. You don't. No, I'm afraid you'll have to help me out. You had a flop of a toothache, remember? I got you some more of those cloves for it. Tortilla, sure. In the saloon at Tortilla, you helped me find a dentist. Sure, I remember that much. Here, have a drink. (Chuckles) I haven't had a toothache since. It was quite a while ago, wasn't it? Well, here's to Tortilla. You don't remember anything you said to me that night, do you? Well, as I said, it was... Do you? No Toni, I don't remember a thing. I was, well, awful drunk. You said... You said that... You said that if I ever needed a friend, to call on you. Did I? I guess men say that. I mean, it's one of those things you say to girls you meet on the wing. No, even if I was drunk when I said it, I meant it. - Oh mister... - What is it, money? Oh a little of that maybe, but mostly... You've got what money can't buy in this part of the world since Pearl Harbor. What's that? A boat. A boat that's free and able to get to the United States. I haven't got the Albatross any longer, Toni. They took it away from me. I owed them some money. Oh. Then you're sort of stuck here and can't get out like me. Yes, that's it. I am sort of stuck here. But you don't have to be stuck here, I've got some money. I'll radio for you to be picked up. Help yourself to another bourbon. No thanks, that first pour you poured me was just the thing. Say, any reason I can't ask you a question or two? No, go ahead. You've got a Jap servant, a slim guy? Oh yes, he's sort of a servant. Well you'd better get on that radio of yours and call the Marines 'cause something's very fishy. Two little Rising Suns just yanked me around out there, then did a quick jabber-jabber with the slim one. The two little ones were carrying regulation Jap army rifles. I know because a sailor friend of mine had captured them. Well Toni, the fact is... The fact is what? Let the Marines hunt their own Japs. You're kiddin'. No I'm not. I came here to get as far away as I could from the kind of messes men get themselves into. Let them fight. Let them kill each other off, only leave me out of it! I don't want any part of it! Maybe I should have been a judge in a dog show. I don't do so good judging men. Well what of it? I hate war and everything it does to people! I hate fighting! Listen mister, you talk like crazy. You gotta fight, everybody's gotta fight. I got a rule I learned young. Keep your fists ready, keep it cocked. So when some mug is ready to sock you, you can sock him first. That, by the way, puts civilization back about 2,000 years. That, by the way, is my religion. So suppose I take a big load off that gentle heart of yours and borrow your phone. No, please. The radio is out of order. Maybe I can fix it. [Matsuru] Miss Chase. Careful, I bruise easy. Mister, you got a servant problem. Make him be good. (gun blasting) Miss Chase, you are slow to understand. Unfortunately you have blundered into a situation that is most serious. Also you are sharp-eyed. You noticed the rifles. So you are prisoner here, indefinitely. (Matsuru speaking Japanese) Very great harm will come to you if you make any attempt to escape or to signal boats offshore. I'll advise, if you behave, I think we can enjoy having you here. How cozy and you're in on it. You know those big, fat, slimy sea snails that Japs eat? They haven't even a shell, the slimy guck. Well you're a little one. Where do I sleep? You can have my room upstairs, I'll sleep down here. No thanks, mister. I'll sleep down here. Get me a blanket. You'll need a pillow. Don't try to get away. You'll be shot. (soft, serene music) (seagulls squawking) Good morning, David. Wild Emporium. Beautiful, don't you think? Yes, very beautiful. Beauty of flowers, stars. These comfort me a little when I am pained by ugliness and cruelty. Blessed for you, David. I slept only once, briefly last night and dreamed of a ship on fire. I did not dream at all. - Matsuru, Matsuru! (speaks Japanese) (speaking Japanese) - The sailing (mumbles) picked him up at dawn. The only survivor, they say. Bowman, get on your radio. Call Navy station. I get it. We were dumb and I did it. I did it! They're all dead! They're gone! Captain Morgan! Captain Morgan! Captain Morgan! (wincing and collapsing) Do something, don't just stand there, do something! (speaking Japanese) Please, Matsuru. David it is hopeless, he's dying. Haven't you anything at least to stop his pain? (gun blasting) Now, there is no pain. Matsuru. Perhaps you had a better suggestion to stop his suffering? Loti, Loti! Got a cigarette? I said, have you got a cigarette? Oh don't get up, all I want's a cigarette. What do I do about a light? Oh I'm sorry, here. You look kinda sick, buddy. What happened about the wounded officer? He's dead, who told you? Nobody told me nothing. I woke up hearing somebody jabbering about a yakka kuriki. Just in case you're not half-Jap, that means wounded officer. I suppose that shot was him dying. Nice people. There was nothing we could do for him. Sure, a mercy killing. Look, the less I have to do with all of you, the better. Just a couple of questions. Who's the Eurasian woman? [David] She's Matsuru's wife, Loti. And Matsurs's the slim jim. I got it. Oh, by the way, do I have to eat with the family or can I go catch myself a raw fish? You can eat with us, of course. I thought maybe it would be easier if you and your gentle Jap friend just decided that I was just too badly wounded too. (intriguing music) You sad bosszilla? You want go away from Niccolo? Yes Maui, I'd give my life to get away from Niccolo and probably will. Hmm? Nothing Maui. If you go, you take Maui beside you? Yes Maui, but no go. There's no boat Maui. But if you have boat, you take Maui huh? Of course Maui, I'd take you. When and if I leave this island, you go with me. Wherever I go. I promised your father, I'd always take care of you and I will. Maui find boat, Japanese boat, well-hid. I know they have the sailing boat, but we can't get it. Too many guards. Not sailing boat Maui find. Maui find another boat. All hidden cove on other side the island. Little boat but good. Tonight after we eat, I'll be up in the observatory. You be sure there are no guards then you whistle and I'll come and meet you right here, understand? We'll take a look at this boat. (soft guitar strumming) (machine roaring) Say, what's going on around here? What's in that passageway under the house? (Maui whistling) Look, if you ever expect to get away from here, you'd better stop seeing things and hearing things. And forget you talked to me, I'll explain when I get back. (soft guitar strumming) (soft vocal humming) Maui, Maui? (David whistling) Maui. (soft operatic vocal music) I'm sorry. I will be able to repair only the receiving set but its better than no radio at all. Your just having a picnic, aren't you? (soft guitar strumming) Maui? Maui! (David whistling) (soft opera humming) You little beggar. Maui. Maui! (groovy retro music) [Radio Announcer] - And now from the Pacific, Tokyo claims the sinking of the United States destroyer of the Carney class, in the vicinity of the Samoas. Washington news officials admitted the destroyer overdue at Manihiki. This is the area that has been proving increasingly dangerous to Allied shipping. Lightening-like stabs by bomber forces have taken a heavy toll. A late dispatch on this (mumbles). A US patrol plane reports sighting an oil slick and scattered wreckage near Manihiki, but no survivors. I'm just beginning to get what's going on around here. (Toni muffled speech) Miss Chase, turn that radio on immediately. Sure, that's it. Somewhere on this island Mr Matsuru, you and your little brown men have got one of those new radio gadgets. The kind our Navy boys are huntin' for. Haven't you? Turn that radio on. - You hear me? - Okay, hold tight. (speaking Japanese) (Matsuru speaking Japanese) I was right. I understood everything he said. You're going to bomb a convoy. You just think you're gonna bomb a convoy but this time you won't get away with it! This time I'll... Shut up you! (soft dramatic music) Blame no one but yourself, David. I'm sorry, of course. You devil you! (muffled speech) You're not a soldier fighting soldiers. You're a murderer. [Toni] David, don't kill him! You and your kind have driven the whole world mad! The same kind of madness that's going to kill you! (generator buzzing) (morse code beeping) (plane engines roaring) (suspenseful music) (morse code beeping) Get up, get up! Open that panel Matsuru. We're going down into that radio room. There are two other doors to open. They are all steel and they open only by signal. David, Matsuru lies about the panel and the doors. They do not open by signal, they open by key. You'll find it in his pocket. David! David, put away that gun. It's not in your nature to kill, so put away that gun. I promise you, I shall forget this whole incident. (gun blasting) (suspenseful music) (plane engines roaring) (morse code beeping) (speaking Japanese) (gun blasting) Hello, get in! (speaking Japanese) (Matsuru speaking Japanese) (speaking Japanese) (Matsuru speaking Japanese) (Matsuru speaking Japanese) (gun blasting) CQ, CQ, CQ, calling a convoy. Longitude 155 degrees, latitude 10 south, come in please. 25 meters, come in please. (radio static) I may not be getting to them at all. What can you do? Take a chance that they do hear me. CQ, the convoy. I realize you may be under radio blackout, but you must do as I say. You're in great danger. I am certain the Japanese bombers have been called to attack you. The size and position of your convoy are known. You must scatter the convoy and get away as fast as possible. Please, believe me. I have forced my way in to operate this directional transmitter. It was this station that sank the destroyer off Manihiki last night. Please answer so that I know you're getting this. I don't like it. Somebody's overheard our orders instructing the convoy. It could be they're trying to get our exact position. Could be a trap. Don't answer. (radio static) What's the matter, why don't they answer? (radio static) (radio speaking Japanese) Toni, Toni, wake up. What is it? Listen. (radio speaking Japanese) What are they sayin'? I didn't get it all but it's a bomber base, wait. (radio speaking Japanese. David! They're still holding the bomber squadron waiting for their exact position. They're asking Matsuru to give the position. The convoy's safe. David! (drill buzzing) (Matsuru speaking Japanese) Come on Toni, come on. What are you going to do? The only thing I can do. Try to reach the convoy again. It won't take 'em 10 minutes to break through the door to that generator. (drill buzzing) CQ the convoy. CQ the convoy, come in please. CQ the convoy, calling the convoy, CQ. (drill buzzing) Why don't we smash the radio? It wouldn't do any good, Toni, to smash the radio. They can repair it if it took them six hours, even 10 hours. The convoy would still be another 80 miles away. That's 15 minutes for a bomber. (drill buzzing) (Matsuru speaking Japanese) (radio static) [Radio] Manihiki to Commander McDonald. Manaheki to Commander McDonald. Do not answer. Official dispatch Navy Intelligence to Commander McDonald as follows: regarding unidentified shortwave (mumbles) in operation beginning 12:42 a.m. this date. Please advise Commander McDonald leave convoy, maintain radio silence unless imperative. Investigate island charted as Niccolo. Longitude 154 degrees west, nine degrees south. Only white resident known to Navy Intelligence, David Bowman: American citizen, astronomer, age 36. Proceed at once, repeat. (drill buzzing) (speaking Japanese) (hammer bashing) Investigate island charted as Niccolo. Longitude 154 degrees west, nine degrees south. Only white resident known to Navy Intelligence, David Bowman: American citizen, astronomer, age 36. Proceed at once. [David] Toni, are you afraid to die? I don't think so. It's either the troop ships and that convoy or us. If one of their battleships or cruisers will talk and they've got to, and they're in range, there's only one thing we can do. Ask 'em to blow this power plant off the map. Well, what are we waitin' for? Well, this is it. David Bowman to Commander McDonald. David Bowman on Niccolo to Commander McDonald. I have just heard Manihiki's message. You can't possibly get here in time to save your convoy or troop ships. This island is a Japanese base. I am a prisoner here and I am barricaded in the control room with the radio; sank the destroyer off Manihiki. (water whooshing) (ship roaring) You have five minutes or less to stop the Japanese on this island from breaking through the last bulkhead door of this control room. This control room is located under the knoll 100 yards east of the small white house in the palm grove. You must understand. If you're in range and can see us, you must open fire at once but hurry. You must hurry. Please answer. - Man your battle stations. - Man your battle stations. (alarm blaring) Forward battery, ready to fire. Forward battery, ready to fire. After battery, ready to commence firing. After battery, ready to commence firing. - Range 26,400 yards. - Range 26,400 yards. [Captain] Mr Bowman, we are ready to fire. You are now in command of my ship. (hammer bashing) I think it'll take at least four salvos Sir. We are deep underground. [Captain] Well done, Mr Bowman. You are in the best tradition of the United States Navy. You are a brave man. - Forward battery. - Forward battery. - Fire! - Fire! (gun blasting) (bombs whirring and exploding) (Japs shouting) (bombs whirring and exploding) (Matsuru shouting Japanese) Forward battery. Forward battery. Fire! Fire! (guns blasting) (bombs whirring and exploding) (Matsuru shouting Japanese) (guns blasting) (bombs whirring and exploding) (guns blasting) (bombs whirring and exploding) David, I'm afraid. Don't be afraid. I try not to be. (bombs whirring and exploding) Now I remember that night in Tortilla, Toni, and everything I said. What did you say David? I said that you were beautiful. That you were lovely. More lovely than anyone I had ever known. More noble than anyone I had ever known. Who had I ever known? Who could take in hearts as friends. Bitterness, disappointment and sorrow and make of them a song. A song of defiance, of hope. Of tenderness and love. And then, remember? I said, "Toni, I love you" You never said anything like that. Well if I didn't, I should have. David? (soft romantic music) (bombs whirring and exploding) (soft romantic music) (planes roaring) (soft orchestral music) (whimsical music)
