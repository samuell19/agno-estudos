This is a 2017 video game. - This is bad. You've gotta get here. You've gotta ahh. ♫ I slay, okay , I slay, ♫ okay, okay, okay, okay This is a video from 2016 by one of the world's biggest stars. ♫ Now let's get in formation Ooh, find your light, there, perfect. Can you please introduce yourself-- And this is a 2017 commercial for an ultra trendy fashion brand. How should I call you? - You can call me Anthony. In a world dominated by super slick aesthetics the tracking lines, dull colors, and grainy image of the video cassette have made a comeback. The last remaining VCR manufacturer ceased production in 2016, but new apps allow you to shoot VHS style videos. It seems for an entire generation the poor image quality makes the memory richer. After all, for '80s kids this little black box was a revolution. In the 1980s one item had pride of place in households around the world, the VCR. Young and old alike spent their evenings in front of a television set which radiated a magic aura once more. Almost unawares the welded experienced a social, economic, and artistic revolution. But the most profound social changes are rarely the showiest. They occur on the fringes first hidden from the general public's view. As often happens with consumer goods it was in the United States that the pioneers dived head first into the video pool instinctively, enthusiastically. - Three, two, one, I'm Ray Glasser, Cleveland, Ohio. I've been collecting videos since 1976 one of the first true Betamax collectors I guess you could say. And as of right now in 2016 I still have 2,000 Betamax tapes and I have lots of blank Betamax tapes. So if Sony stopped making earlier this year, doesn't matter, I'll never run out of blank tapes. The Sony Betamax. Its only purpose is to serve you. When the Japanese brand Sony launched its new video format the Betamax in 1976 it sent shockwaves around the world. In cinema or in television the moving image had always been the stuff of professionals. The first videotape recorders were the size of a room and cost as much as the average house. But after a fierce technological and commercial race spanning several decades, Sony suddenly abolished this privilege. Betamax made video accessible to everyone. Yet only a handful of enthusiasts understood what a radical change this represented and were willing to dig deep. - Wow, what is that? - This is the Sony Betamax. - The SL 7200 at the time cost somewhere around $1,200 and for somebody like me I was lucky to make $100 a week. So imagine how much it took for me to save enough money, and get into debt, and buy a VCR like that. - Back in 1976 I was working in a restaurant. I took a second job to make some extra money so I could afford one of these. And in June of '76 I got my first Sony Betamax. - If it boiled down to am I going to eat today, or am I going to spend some money on two or three blank tapes? I'd choose the blank tapes. - You're obviously a man who's having troubles at home. You're constantly fighting with your family over what TV shows to watch. Well fortunately you're looking at a simple solution to your problems, Sony Betamax. At the time Sony marketed its machine as a simple recording device. For TV viewers in the '70s it was nothing short of a miracle. - So you can watch it whenever you want. - I can record the eight o'clock movie when I'm at work, or the TV show, whatever I wanted. Come home at 1:30 in the morning, rewind the tape, and watch it back. And that was perfect for me. - The Betamax completely relieved me from the tyranny of the TV schedule. And remember at this time, 1976, 1977 this was a revolution. No one could imagine this kind of thing. Not surprisingly the early days were exhilarating. - How ya doing? This is the first annual VCR Plus Michigan Convention in Fremont, Ohio, February, 5th 1979. Enthusiasts organized conventions, a group of 50 video fans would bring along their VCRs to record as much as their tapes would allow. From the outset the little black box had its own distinctive community. The pioneers exchanged tapes too with their peers all over the country. Thanks to ads placed in a specialist magazine that was just a few xeroxed pages at the time. - My friend Gary and I began running ads in the Video Files newsletter for things we were looking for as you can see right here. In return for your favors, this is so funny 'cause it's so dated. I currently have 76 Betamax tapes. In part my library includes 16 Star Treks, 15 movies including The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Silent Earth, The Exorcist-- - One of the first collectors that I got in touch with in 1976 was Ray Glasser. - Live and Let Die, Diamonds are Forever, Dracula Prince of Darkness-- - Who was this crazy, passionate, film fan in Ohio. - Man with the Golden Gun, The Forbin Project, Westworld-- - And because we lived in completely different parts of the country, I was in Central Florida and he was in Ohio, we had access to completely different kinds of programming. - Time Tunnel, Voyage at the Bottom of the Sea, and Mission Impossible. - But we would regularly start sending each other video tapes back and forth. - And we made so many connections, people would call us long distance on the phone and this went on for years. And this is how we got our collections to be so big. Remember this is before video stores, before movies were available for rent, this is how you hooked up and contacted other people and began trading tapes and building your video tape library. - Take three, this is Ray Glasser speaking from Cleveland. I am real as you can see and now here is your Betamax dubbing request. But Ray Glasser and his gang were too busy having fun to notice the darkness on the horizon. It's a simple process just turn the power on, set the time, put in a tape cassette, push a couple of buttons, and you are taping a movie off television in the privacy of your own home. There's only one thing wrong here, it's illegal. The video fan's uncharted interlude had come to an end. Seeing the revolution on its way the studios took fright. They realized the industry's future was at stake. TV content giant Universal took Sony to court. For Hollywood, copying was akin to shoplifting. - It's always been our position that the copying in home, or outside the home, is the same. Copying is copying and it's illegal. Typically the entertainment establishment was scared of changes to an arrangement it had put in place decades ago. Legend has it Universal's wrath stemmed from a row mainly about fans of TV series. - One of Sony's big ads said you know now you don't have to miss Columbo when you're watching Kojak. The television networks relied on being able to program against each other. The idea was people had to choose and it was all about winning their attention. And now all of the sudden there's a technology let people watch both. And that shifted the balance of power between viewers and the studios. And it was not something that the studios and the networks were happy about. The fact of the matter is royalties and the possibility of cutting out commercials were the real problem. The studios and networks feared one of their main sources of revenue would dry up. Watch it disappear. And to be honest they were not entirely wrong. - Back in the earliest days of home video all of us religiously cut out the commercials. - The problem with eliminating the commercials from TV shows and movies is I'd have to set an alarm clock and wake up at two, or three, or four o'clock in the morning and be very bleary, and sit by the machine, and start the recording at the right moment. And then the moment they went to commercial I'd have to rewind the tape, and make an edit point, and put the machine in pause, and then be absolutely ready to go the moment they came out of commercial. So it was like having your finger on the trigger, you had to be absolutely ready. Oh there's the show, boom. And you'd have to hit the button. - And all of my tapes on the wall still have no commercials, and I'm very proud of that. Video disc system-- The case lasted almost 10 years. The stakes were huge. A potential market of several billion dollars, and more importantly citizens' freedoms. In 1984 the case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. This is NBC Nightly News reported by Tom Brokaw. - Good evening, if the video tape recorder is running in your home tonight, relax. You don't have to draw the drapes or bolt the doors. You're not breaking the law. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that it is okay to videotape television programs in your home. Russ Ward NBC News. The ruling was very close with just five out of nine judges finally coming down in favor of Sony. A narrow but an anachronistic victory too. In 1984 some 20 million Americans owned a VCR, not just a handful of geeks. - Millions of Americans already had VCRs and suddenly to make them all criminal how would you do a recall, right? - I think even a few of the Supreme Court justices had to admit, yes, I own a VCR. Good afternoon Lieutenant Lucerne-- And even Lieutenant Columbo, the man at the heart of the scandal got in on the act. - I'm just silly, sir, but that machine is weirdly fantastic. Stop, pause, let's not fast forward the tape of history, rewind. As early as 1977 Betamax faced a formidable competitor in the VHS. This newcomer could record for twice as long. Winning the price war VHS quickly became the market standard. By the mid '80s many Westerners had already succumbed to the VCR's charms. And as in all true romances the first encounter was key. - My first memories of a VCR was me coming home from school as a 13 year old and I come into the house and there is my dad counting money paying a man and there's this huge box, I had no idea. - Oh man, first of all they weigh a ton. I mean they have steel chassis. They're this wide, this deep-- - And there was this huge chunky machine sitting on our sideboard at home. And my mum said it's to record and play films. - When you hit the eject button there was a top loader so it came, the cassette came up from the top. The flap opened, you had to shove the cassette in, then push down hard, and press play. - And you were recording your program. - And it just opened up a whole world. - It's an exciting world we live in. Now capture it and relive it again and again with the new Sanyo Betacord. The video recording system that saves all of your favorite shows on video cassette. Turn on to Sanyo and turn on life. ♫ I said that's life, Sanyo But this amazing new world opening up before viewers was in reality very poor. The few video cassettes available for sale cost the Earth. So in the United States and Europe some people got the idea of renting them. The first video stores belonged to perfectly ordinary people. They were just family run businesses. You even had co-merchants in grocery stores with videos for rental. - You might be going to a delicatessen, you'd get a ham and Swiss, and you'd walk out with a movie as well. Then the rental stores started to pop up. - Let me tell you when we first started we had one cabinet and it was about from here down and that held every video tape we had. Yeah that held every one we had. And it took us probably almost a year to get all those because there's no companies selling videotapes. I mean this a brand new thing. There's no distributors. No, all that had to be built. The first video rental stores opened while the studios continued to look down on the little black box a niche sector stepped in to the breach. A genre that preferred darkness to light, but which helped the market take off. - 100 % porn played a role in the VHS boom. There's no doubt. I was there in retail when people were getting VCRs and every new customer would come in and they were interested in the regular movies but everyone was interested in those adult movies. The recent opening of the adult video center on Prospect Avenue is testimony to the growth of the VCR business and the heavy business done by blue movies. Porn producers are often a step ahead of the game. They understood before everyone else the true nature of the VHS revolution. For the first time in the history of cinema a movie could be watched in the privacy of the home and by an infinite number, a revolution. This revolution wasn't a high culture revolution, but a revolution of ordinary folk who were thrilled they no longer had to go to porn theaters but could rent tapes to watch in the privacy of their own homes instead. - I have never been in that type of theater, never. But now in the privacy of your own home, people don't know. I mean I don't know anybody here, I don't even know you. The bravest may have dared talk about it openly on camera, but the majority still preferred to keep quiet. The video store became the very symbol of society's ambiguous relationship to sex. - And that was in a back room all the time with a curtain or like a bar. What is that called where it's the short doors and they swivel? - What do you call them? Like the, what do you call them? Like the Western doors right? - It was like an old Western like those swinging doors. There would be a sign on the door saying 18 and over and you'd go through the swinging doors and they'd be like oh my god. - And then it's just bodies, naked bodies, on every case. They looked just like slaughterhouses with all this pink flesh on the covers. To be honest it wasn't very arousing. - After putting a number of the things back on the shelf, the cases, I would have to wash my hands. It might have been psychological. It might have been because they were dirty. But after you put a number of adult movies back on the shelf, I was like, I'm just gonna wash my hands. Sex remained a forbidden fruit. The video cassette was still in its infancy, but it had already titillated the West's moral values. Society suddenly stiffened. Mississippi is considered a pornography free zone. At local video stores X-rated movies have been banned. Even Playboy and Penthouse have been run out of Tupelo by anti-porn crusaders who have made smut a four letter word. - Don't aim your pornography at me, if you don't want me to aim my .45 at you. - It did become very political for me, because I was watching my customers and my friends get indicted, and go to trial, and in some cases go to jail for selling an adult movie. And almost through the entire history of owning that business it was really driven more, at that point, about First Amendment than anything else. And you know the First Amendment, freedom of speech. But the sheer force of people wanting the product, the sheer force of consumer interest kept people going, because even during those eras where the government was going after it sales were big and people were making a lot of money. The video cassette had spoken. Market forces are irresistible. In the wake of porn producers saw the full potential of this new medium. They began to make programs specifically for VHS release. The first huge hit was a tape made to be watched again-- - Stomach flat, butt tight, roll up out of your torso-- - And again-- - Roll up out of your torso. - And again-- - Roll up out of your torso. And again-- - Roll up out of your torso. Head to the right, back, left, really stretch it out, front-- - You couldn't go to a theater and have Jane Fonda on the screen doing an aerobics exercise where that you could practice along with you. You couldn't do that in the theater. You can do that in your living room. You can do that at 10 in the morning, nine in the morning, you could do it at midnight. That's the great thing. And she says you've only got to do it 20 minutes a day. Do this 20 minutes a day, five days a week, and you'll look like me at 60. Not like me like Jane Fonda. And she looked pretty good at 60 let's be honest. - But I think Jane Fonda's workout was the first one and she sold like 10 million copies. So then everybody jumped on the bandwagon. ♫ Let's go jazzercising, exercising. - Okay that's good, looks good, feel the beat. - There's one called the Baby and Mom Aerobics where the mom holds the baby. - One and heel, two and heel, three. - And what else? - There's also a prayer aerobics where you can pray to God and Jesus while working out-- - Blessercise. - Let's warm up with a bible verse, 2 Samuel 22:40. And it goes like this, thou hast girded me with strength. - Another favorite category obviously-- - Christian tapes, those are just something special. - How to videos is another big one. Like instructional videos so you can watch somebody do something. - Anything that is for kids is incredible because the universe that adults create for kids is pure psychedelia, pure insanity. - I think the best example is a video that we found called Rent-A-Friend. Where it's like this guy is gonna be your video friend. And so he records himself just sitting on a chair, like this, and he talks to the camera and then he leaves a pause so that the person watching can answer. It's 45 minutes long. Hi. What's your name? Yeah, you know I see that. I really that is you isn't it? Yeah. VHS shattered the norms and paved the way for all kinds of wacky stuff. Aspiring producers stepped in to this nascent market. No more need for sophisticated cameras, or film, just a camcorder. This was the heyday of videos that explored innovative seduction techniques. - Welcome to seduction through hypnosis the revolutionary new way of seducing the woman of your dreams. Videos made to be watched by dogs complete with spoof game shows. Others even turned the TV set into a fireplace. All trod a fine line between commercialism and poetics of the absurd. - I think it's that moment that we're pretty into is like what are we? We're not animals, I guess we're better than animals, but we're still operating on the same instinctive junk that we're standing around a fire but it's on a VHS tape. It's like crazy what we've become. - We know it's all garbage, media is garbage, everything is garbage, let's enjoy it. Let's like rub our faces in it. - Or a movie like Citizen Kane, great movie, but like I'd rather watch any one of these stupid videos before that. And I think that, yeah, I think that these videos say more about American culture than Citizen Kane does. - This is who we are. This is what American culture-- - It made us-- - It made us. - This moment was made by all of this stuff behind me. Boosted by this new content, VCR sales exploded at last. In the early 1980s VHS took the West by storm. In this age of electronics for the masses the VCR became the number one must have gadget. - And I hear that it's the biggest craze since the hula hoop. - I think it's gonna move into the necessity stage. It may be the fastest growing business in America. This was the golden age of video stores, too. Which sprung up on every street corner. For the first time in the history of cinema you could mix all types of films. It was the heyday of unabashed and joyful cinephilia. - I'll give you the nickel tour for nothing. The outer perimeter of the wall is the normal films, and then we have our live entertainment. These are our foreign films. We've got silent films. We've got a religious section. We've got an astronomy section. We've got a UFO section. - My dad took me to the video store which was a few miles away from our house, and it was, it was like heaven. And that was my idea of heaven. I can still remember how it smelled. It was some kind of weird plastic smell in there, but there was no separation of genres. It was just a complete mix of films. - Being able to go to a video store and to be able to have this like wide array of just choice was just so incredible. - It's amazing. - No a video store was democracy that's really what it was. The video store became a community facility. Everyone frequented these new temples of entertainment regardless of age or gender. People would meet there and improve their movie culture. A utopian world for an entire generation. - There you go, thank you. It's getting on towards closing time now, but the scene at Eddie's still looks like rush hour on the Hollywood Freeway. - What you did have in the early days of video stores was this was a social space. You wouldn't just go in, grab a movie, and leave. People would have conversations in the aisles. They would talk about different movies. There was always a very social experience in the same ways you would talk to a bartender. So you've been looking for this for what nearly 20 years now? Since '77 yes. And I found it because of Donovan. - Just got lucky I guess. - And man I want an action movie. I want a science fiction movie. I want a romance movie. It was nice to talk to people. I mean I know Netflix, if you like this movie other viewers said you might like this movie. Computers only do that 'cause some knucklehead in a cubicle told the computer to do that. It's much nicer when you talk to people and that was a great thing about video stores. Generating curiosity and excitement video store openings were often festive occasions. But in all the excitement people quickly forgot these stores were first of all markets, which turned movies into commodities, and as in any market packaging was key. - The cover art if that would pop out at you, and you'd just be like oh what is this? - If you're browsing a shelf and you're sort of moving along first it's got to get your attention enough to make you want to take it out. So first there's that immediate sort of like, huh? - My grandmother used to say a great expression, you buy the picture. - Well this kind of packaging where it's like a pizza box kind of. It's the Gospel Bill Show where it's, he's like a singing cowboy or something. He's got like puppets. I mean that's just weird. And I just can't leave this stuff behind. I can't walk away from this. I mean this is just too cool. I love the strange stuff. Another good example-- - It's a good movie? - I haven't watched this yet, but do I really need to? I mean it kind of you know what I mean? But I will, now I will. In video stores all over the world one section had the most eye-catching covers. A movie genre that had always made the sensational the very essence of its existence. And with VHS it found a whole new audience. Kids get the movies from the horror section of the video store. Most of the violent movies are rated R and aren't supposed to be seen unless you're 17 years old. - I had rented Bloody Moon with my dad and it was a phenomenal day because Bloody Moon was just so, had some great gory killings in it. Bloody Moon, summer nights filled with horror. A killer whose lust for blood will stop at nothing. - I also remember renting Cannibal Holocaust. - Return of the Living Dead really scared the crap out of me, man. That thing shook my whole world. - And then there were the Fulci films the zombie flesh eaters. - Basket Case or the puppet master movies. I mean really low budget horror movies. While the movies may be the rage with kids, it's a different story when they're parents learn about what they believed were simply horror movies. - I had no idea that it was at the depth of this absolute mutilation. I won't watch it, I'm sorry. - It's all these little experiences that just shape you. I don't know for the better or the worst, I think I turned out okay. But you know I just never knew that kind of fantasy, that type of programming existed before I saw it on tape. In fact the market for these videos has become so popular-- Ghoul was the perfect genre for VHS. The video rental market knew no bounds. To attract consumers the producers tried to outdo each other in the outrageous stakes. The most excessive hit the jackpot. Do you know a director called John Alan Schwartz? - How's his last name? - Schwartz-- - No. - Who I'm sorry? John Alan Schwartz. - John, what did he make sorry? - I don't know if I know him. - John Alan Schwartz? Who is it? - No I don't believe I do, who's that? Who is John Alan Schwartz? - John Alan Schwartz is my brother. He was responsible for coming up with the idea for Faces of Death. - Oh yes, okay, all right. - Oh, well I absolutely know Faces of Death. - Faces of Death changed my life. - I mean that is the movie. - Oh Faces of Death you know I still have not been able to stomach Faces of Death. - Yeah I can't do it. - We would rent it and we would get together and we would just be like. As the monkey as brought down the hall and of course this asperity was made. The waiter presented the men with a tool for this monkey. Faces of Death portrayed itself as a compilation of footage of death in all its forms. One scene stands out for its gruesomeness. - I came up with the idea to intersperse real film footage with reenacted footage. And to make the reenacted footage so realistic that there was no way for the viewer to separate reality from what they were producing as nonfiction from fiction. Secured in a special trap the animal is now ready to become the main dish. With this movie VHS redefined the limits of what was showable. Selling hundreds of thousands of copies, Faces of Death posed the question of ethics and capitalism. - When I was doing Faces of Death IV I wanted to make it as grim, and disgusting, and as horrifying as possible. Now is there an element of morality involved and so forth? None, zero, it wouldn't be great if I was the kind of guy that said I can't go forth with this project because it's just defiling me as a human being. I wasn't that guy. I was the perfect guy for the job. While Faces of Death and other similar horrors barely caused a stir in the United States they shocked all of Europe. Video was a test for the systems in place a revealer of established norms. But only in one country did videos cause a national outcry. - The problem was the videos had no classification, films did, and there are all sorts of horrors sort of getting on to these videos. It mixed sex with violence, real violence, beatings, killings. It brought in some awful situations of using animals, you think of it, it just went on and on. For his anti-ghoul crusade, Graham Bright found a prime supporter. In the space of months the tabloid press made horror films the hottest topic in the land. In its sights were 40 films it labeled video nasties. Bright saw this as a perfect opportunity to shine. To convince other MPs incense of these shameful videos the wily politician made the enemy's arms his own. - So I thought well the only thing to do is to show them what we're talking about. So I got Scotland Yard to make up a 20 minute program with these horrendous things. They were taking it fairly lighthearted. Like say when who's doing the eye screams and then we brought it on. - I title like Driller Killer, Cannibal Holocaust, and I Spit on your Grave were among videos watched by MPs this afternoon. They contain scenes that were so offensive and so appalling that some members had to leave the room. - To be honest with you I'm absolutely delighted. I mean the Prime Minister made it quite clear yesterday that she was behind the bill, and the government was behind the bill, and that she wanted the bill to pass through the House as rapidly as possible. - Of course it's a perfect thing for politicians to get behind, because it's kind of easy compared to all the other things like unemployment and the Falklands War and stuff like that, where it's like oh shit, this is really hard to deal with. What we can do is direct everyone's attention to these dangerous videos, and how we're gonna save the family, and save the children, and the good of English society. We're banning a few of these films. And that's exactly what they did. - We are there to protect decent society. And anyone who wants to take the other path has got to admit, they've got to account for themselves. What better way to annoy young people. VHS made a liar of George Orwell. In 1984 the British government sought to control freedom of expression, but it was to learn and its expense that banning or cutting films was no longer the best way to stop people watching them. History repeated itself like the video pioneers in their day, The British Pirates proved the video cassette was a punkette. ♫ Catch catch the horror taxi ♫ I fell in love with a video nasty - If you're a horror fan you picked up fanzines like Samhain, or Shock Express, or the Darkside, and you found other horror fans through writing letters. And people would swap their lists of the films that they had, and you'd copy them, and there'd be an underground of people either selling bootleg copies of uncut versions of Zombie Flesh Eaters of whatever it was, or selling the actual video nasties which had been taken off the shelves. And it was driven underground, and once you drive something underground, it makes you all the more passionate about it. ♫ All I want is to make a killing ♫ To drill a killer might be really thrilling ♫ Why are my victims so unwilling A new era dawned. VHS laid down the law. Videos could not be censored anymore. - First off I don't feel comfortable children, at all, watching movies intended by adults. But that is the price we pay for freedom. The price we pay is that kids can go into their parent's liquor cabinet and get drunk on a bottle of vodka. It's unstoppable. It's the beautiful freedom that we have that kids could be exposed to stuff that in an ideal world wouldn't want them exposed to. But that's the reality of the world. Imagine the perfect video store. It would have a great selection, right? Right over 10,000 videos. The United Kingdom was tearing itself apart over horror movies, but VHS had already changed the stakes. The rules of cinema itself would be overhauled. 1987 was the turning point with the launch of the video store chain Blockbuster. The name said it all. ♫ Blockbuster Video wow what a difference - Only had to go into a Blockbuster once or twice in my life, but I always found it very bright in there when I would go in there. I didn't get it why it is, it's like are you guys doing surgery in here? Why is it so bright in here? What do I know? Blockbuster imposed new rules on the sector. It spruced up its aisles and its act. This new generation video store sold good, clean, family entertainment. The chain's launch also marked the end of the pioneers era. Financial wheelers and dealers moved in to the home video market. A sign of the times, Blockbuster's main investor had made its fortune in rubbish. Video was now just another business. - When that shift happened and that you would notice it was the moment when you walked into your video store and in the back there was a wall of the new release, much like in a grocery store you'd put the milk in the back and a couple of the other things you know people are looking for. - You know you'd go to your local store for a new Hollywood release, and you'd have to get on a list. It's like, no I'm sorry that's out, because they only had two copies. - Now all of the sudden they were guaranteed that that first week whatever movie was the big exciting one was in. And that's the moment when it shifted from the video store owners being these kind of early pioneers who were just building their own collections, to them starting to go into partnership with the studio. The alliance between VHS and the studios were sealed. Hollywood took over and invested massively in the home video market. Symbolic of this historic U-turn was a movie Universal had produced back in 1982. With its ongoing lawsuit against Sony the studio had always refused to release it on VHS. When director Steven Spielberg made the movie he swore he would never release it on home video. He finally caved in to the all the pressure. Profit had a lot to do with it. The E.T. video cassette is expected to make $150 million dollars. - After 1987 home video was making more money than theaters. And so eventually theaters would become the kind of advertising window for home video. - In fact the theatrical was a lost leader to promote the video. It was simply a marketing tool for the VHS. VHS had laid down the law in the West. In the United States and Japan some 70 % of households owned a VCR, 12 million West Germans, too. And there were already around 30 million tapes in France. Home video now dominated entertainment in the capitalist world. It had one last battle to fight, maybe the biggest, the hardest, this time the upstart was to take on an ideology, communism. The more oppressive the regime, the more violent the shock. In the Eastern Bloc the first cracks appeared in Poland. In this state under General Jaruzelski's iron-fisted control, one movie came to symbolize the revolt. The story of a young woman arrested and tortured by the regime. It was set in the '50s but no one was fooled. When the film was shown to the authorities it met with hostility. The officials were livid. There was a sort of committee of military personnel under Jaruzelski's command. They decided Interrogation definitely could not be released because it was anti-communist. The film was put aside. An attempt was even made to destroy it. That's when we decided to copy it onto VHS. The VCR was the new arm in this fight for freedom. Copying tapes became an act of defiance. Ever so patiently the Polish rebels transferred films from one tape to another. Their means were limited but these political activists understood just how high the stakes were. There was a huge reaction to video cassettes. More and more people were buying or getting a hold of VCRs. A whole social life developed around this. If you own this kind of equipment you'd invite your friends and acquaintances over. We had our own unique form of home cinema. I have yet to meet someone who didn't see the movie on VHS at the time. The government's efforts to prevent it being seen failed miserably. Soviets, Hungarians, and Poles fell in love with video immediately. At the time a VCR cost as much as the average car. No problem, the stores were empty and there wasn't much else to consume. For the young especially it was a means of escaping the gloomy reality of life and the ideology of Eastern European cinema. There was a huge black market for tapes. The VCR was a chink in the curtain. First I saw all the movies everyone had to see. Movies staring Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Sylvester Stallone. It was normal, everyone watched those movies. Regardless of your social status or education, whether you were unemployed or a lecturer. Everyone watched Rambo and Commando. It was a generational thing and we all remember the films from those days. The copies were barely watchable and sometimes recorded in movie theaters. A monotone Polish voice interpreted the movie simultaneously. Chuck Norris is John T. Booker. But no one cared, young Poles devoured tapes of action movies, comedies and sci-fi anything that came from the West. The authorities realized just how dangerous the situation was for them. This video revolution was perilous. Not because everyone saw Interrogation, or other similar movies, but because it was a revolution of the imagination. Soft power from the West. People were fascinated by the depiction of the West in these movies. And it reinforced their longing for the West. The regimes were teetering. No need to wait for the Berlin Wall to fall you just had to look at the top 10. In 1988 when a Polish Daily asked its readers to list their favorite movies, there wasn't a single Polish film, or any from the Soviet Bloc. Just good old American blockbusters. Stop, let's rewind one last time. The VHS revolution may not have been the one that we thought. As well as the comrades imagination it attacked the communist regime's very essence. All over Eastern Europe as in Warsaw in the Socialist Bloc's biggest market, video piracy was a kind of fast track training in the laws of capitalism. The distributors and producers of these video cassettes could be seen as pioneers of capitalism in Poland. They put into practice all the principles of the capitalist market, supply and demand, pricing, and a free market economy. It's no coincidence that some went on to found the first private companies. The VHS and its freedom had got the better of the communist regime's rigidity. The sky was now the limit. Revenge at last for the political activists. In 1990 almost 10 years after its release on video Interrogation triumphed at Cannes. Krystyna Janda became the symbol of a newly liberated people. But after the initial euphoria Eastern Europe was to quickly discover what lay behind the scenes in the West, and it wasn't always a pretty picture. I still recall what a shock my first New York trip was. I realized I'd already seen all of these places, but they had been framed in such a way as to conceal the trash and the homeless on the sidewalks. There was something that the system I believe in free markets, freedom of choice, economic liberalism didn't realize. Many people, the majority in fact, lost out. And my generation which was fascinated by all these changes was unaware of it. A symbol of the euphoric capitalism of the '80s, the VHS was not surprisingly adversely affected by market forces too. It was replaced in the mid '90s by the DVD, then downloading in the early noughties. These days you're more likely to find tapes in the rubbish bin than your living room. The video stores have closed down. But it will remain the embodiment of an economic, social, and artistic revolution. A major shift that liberated the image and the eye, made censorship obsolete, and allowed everyone, everywhere to produce and watch everything. The VHS tape will live on in the memories the world of the '80s shares. Some will never forget the role this old agitator played in history. - This is a reminder, just never forget. Never forget, a lot of people who see it, young people do go, is that a VHS tape? And then truly a lot of older people go, I love it, still the best, I still have all my old tapes. I'm like hell yeah, and we'd give each other a high five and we'd go on our merry way. - There would be no YouTube if this wasn't here first. This is what gave people the idea of I need to see it, I need to see it now, and I want to see it. - Those who experienced it look back on it with great affection. Because it was a community. - Personally I can't think about movie culture without thinking about it being, including home video and video stores. That is me I'm as old as home video, right? This little bit of plastic has been granted the ultimate accolade. Alongside Plato, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy the video cassette and its nasties now line the shelves of the prestigious Yale University Library. - This is in the middle of all the oh my god Zombie Child right next to a 19th century book. Skinned Alive. - It's so incongruent to have all these tapes next to 19th century manuscripts and all that. But I guess that's the way of the future, right? Mixing high and low. The ultimate consumer product, the VHS, has won it's spurs at last. - So I just made this up now. Give me a second. ♫ I got them VHS blues ♫ I watch 'em all the time ♫ The VHS blues ♫ I wasn't kind, I didn't rewind ♫ Don't give me no DVDs ♫ Or HDTV, I just want my VHS blues If you can use that use it.
