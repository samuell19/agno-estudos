Are you okay? I can't believe you got bit by a clown. This is disgusting. I hope he's not sick. Sick like how? Emmett, a clown bit you. That doesn't happen every day. Who knows what germs he's carrying, diseases he's got. It's just plain wrong. It's okay, em. I'll take care of you. Oh, shit. You don't look so good. I'm fine. I'm just kinda hungry. Animal cracker?

He was raiding through our fridge, so I kicked him out. You got bit by a clown? Yeah, I know, right? It's crazy. Right on my leg. Funny, I never heard of a clown biting before. Yeah, there was that one back in '88 at the marina. Oh, no, no, no, that wasn't a clown, that was a mime. No, it was a clown. Oh, no, no, ray, that was a mime. That was a mime as sure as I'm sitting here. I know a clown when I see one, sam. Yeah, well, you didn't see one at the marina because it was a god damn mime. It was a god damn clown, okay? Look, let's just agree to disagree. How about that? Okay, sure, fine, 'cause you're wrong. I am not wrong! You're wrong! No, you're wrong! I know the difference between a god damn clown and a mime, okay? Okay, okay, okay! Anyway, it was a clown. He bit me. He ran off. He was very suspicious. You find the clown, you find the kid. I'm sure of it. What's the clown's name? I don't know. He didn't speak. Oh, well, then possibly it was just a mime then. Okay, the clown's name was fucko, okay? Fuck, fucko the clown, and he bit emmett. A clown... not a mime, a clown. Write that down. Fucko. Strange name. Hmm. I've never heard of a clown named fucko. Can you tell us anything else about this clown? What was his act? What the hell? You would never hurt me, would you, emmett? Never, andy. I love you. You're my little brother. I'll always protect you. Then why am I so afraid of you? Jeez. Emme my face. My skin was changing. Oh. Fuck! The urge to feed was strong. I wanted him... Andy. I had to get away. You've gotta get some sleep. That was a long shift. I just wanted to stop by and see how everyone was doing before I crashed. I'm sorry I blew up last night. Oh, that's okay. I'm worried about emmett. He'll be fine. What? What is going on? Come on! Mom's gotta have a long sleeve. You've been working too hard. And you know emmett can be a handful. I don't know, frances. He's been acting really strange lately... ever since that clown bit him. If I didn't leave fast... I'm afraid of what I would've done. What did the doctor say? Good luck with that. Emmett is not gonna see a doctor. It's from emmett. "Trouble. Gotta find that clown. Call you later." What does that mean? He's gone. He went to go look for the clown. Maybe he didn't know you were here. No, you don't understand. Something is wrong with him. I had to hide my face... hide what I was becoming. I couldn't let anyone see me like this. I would live my life in the shadows... silently walking... prowling for the innocence... to consume. I never felt a hunger like this before. Something deep inside me... fighting the inevitable. My mouth... sealed shut as if my own body hates what it's becoming. What the hell am I? Emme kelly. Oh, my god. Emmett, where are you? Let me come and get you. Please don't. Whatever trouble you're in, I'll help you. It's my fault. I have to find the clown. Forget the clown, emmett. Just come home. I have to tell you something. Tell andy... I'll never hurt him. Emmett, please come home. Pull his shoes off! Come on, get his shoes off! I can't! They're stuck! His feet are too big! Feed me. Feed my urge. Once I tasted it, I wanted more. I needed more. Who sent this? "He's mine now." Where's andy? Sleeping! Andy! My baby! Where are you taking me, emmett? I'm scared, emmett. franks.

Thank you, sir. May I have another? Andy... uh... I'm sorry, andy. I didn't mean for you to see that. You'd never hurt me like that, would you, emmett? Oh, no. No, andy. I would never let that happen. Not to you. I would die first, andy... before I'd... before I'd... let myself hurt you. Then why am I so afraid of you? Run andy! Run home, andy! I'll never let myself hurt you! I'd die first, andy. I'd die first, andy. My brother andy... hands up, clowny! Nothing I wouldn't do for him. What the hell you do that for? Bang. There she is. Hey, lady, can we see your baby? Look at the size of his feet! I.a. is a long way from the parish. And I sure as hell never expected to find true love in a city like this. But I did. And it was beautiful. He was beautiful. We were made for each other. We fit. He told me that. We had some days. We did. And I loved that man with every ounce of my being. The first few months after we were married were the happiest days of my life. We couldn't get enough of each other. I felt the power of his love. And my heart was full to bursting. I dreamed of someone like him. But never thought he existed. Just a little girl's dream. Back in new orleans, my gran pere was known around the parish as a protector. He watched over folks, watched over me. Some may call him a conjurer, as he knew the ways of the old ones. Some say my gran pere could cast some spells. He blew what they called the goofer dust on me back then... and gave me some in a little vial that I wear today. He said it was the dirt my dead kin were buried in, said that his mojo would protect me when he weren't on this side of the grass no more, when the dirt reclaimed him. I never told anyone what it was. My gift from gran pere. I can't cry now or shed no more tears. But after a while, that man started treating me differently. Badly. A man's not supposed to lay hands on his woman unless they lovin' hands. I'd wish it was like it was before. But I knew there were others. A woman knows. Our gran pere always said his granddaughter deserved to be loved. And if I ever had that love in my heart... it would never die. I knew he was a player. I just thought he was done playin'. I told him that I couldn't stand for no more cheatin'. I told him I deserved better. He didn't like that. He was my man. And I loved him... even if he did that bad thing to me. And I have that love in my heart. And just like my gran pere promised... that love... would never... die. Like it or not... we would spend eternity... together. ♪♪
