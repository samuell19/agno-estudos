I don't get it. ﻿How does she know we have green sheets? ﻿So you're interrogating me, too? ﻿You had a good relationship, ﻿she was a devoted researcher, you highly praised her. ﻿She had a lot of issues. ﻿At the last office party you said she had a brilliant future. ﻿She had potential but I knew she was a little nuts. ﻿What's that? ﻿There's a cameraman and a reporter. ﻿It's about us. How did they find out? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Someone here must've leaked it. ﻿They can't broadcast this, can they? ﻿Which of you is trying to get famous at our expense? We can't control them.you know... ﻿You sold us out! ﻿I don't know how they got here ﻿but a lawyer can get you a gag order. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿To get those bastards out of here. ﻿If you don't mind, we have a few more questions. ﻿Excuse me, what are you doing here? ﻿Who are you? -What does it matter? ﻿Are you connected with Prof. Golden? ﻿I'm his wife and I want you out of here. ﻿Put the camera down! ﻿I said no comment. ﻿I have to go calm her down. ﻿You can't go there. ﻿Leave him alone.

Another crappy case? ﻿I had to do it. ﻿Come on in. ﻿I'm sorry Merav bothered you. ﻿The woman lost her mind. ﻿That's not what the cops think. ﻿She chased me, tried to seduce me, ﻿I said no and this is her revenge. ﻿Oded, I'll be straight with you, ﻿you have to set your ego aside. ﻿The police have information that could ruin you. ﻿Let's just say you had sex with her. ﻿If you admit to having sex with her full consent, ﻿the question will be whether you exploited your position ﻿and you'll get off easy. ﻿But if you go for broke and say nothing happened ﻿and they prove even the slightest thing, ﻿you could be charged with rape and that's another story. ﻿Mom. ﻿Is everything okay? ﻿Yes. I was feeling dizzy before. ﻿I'm hungry. ﻿I thought we'd eat together. ﻿I'm going away. ﻿Where to? ﻿The Far East. Thailand. ﻿Your'e leaving everything? ﻿What will be with you? ﻿Don't give me that pitying look, Mom. ﻿He was so nice to you. ﻿You knew he was married. ﻿Don't you dare! ﻿No one should have found out. ﻿People will talk. ﻿You should've kept it to yourself, in your heart,in my heart. ﻿You would've done fine if no one found out. ﻿I don't care what people say. ﻿Today, for the first time, I felt clean, ﻿like nobody can push me around. ﻿That bothers you. ﻿Are you crazy? -Why? ﻿Because I refuse to be humiliated? ﻿I remember watching you when I was six, ﻿begging for mercy, begging him to stay ﻿while he abused you. ﻿You had to wait for him to die to start living. ﻿I only want the best for you. ﻿Okay, so you had an agreement, mutual admiration, a friendship. ﻿Did you meet away from work? ﻿Not that I recall. ﻿You said she visited your house. ﻿Yes, for work. -I didn't ask why. ﻿What happened in Eilat? ﻿What happened? -I'm asking you. ﻿She said you stayed in Room 636 ﻿There was a conference, we were all at the same hotel. -The same room? ﻿No. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Positive. ﻿Then how do your explain the evidence of you sharing a room? ﻿Photos, text messages. ﻿You know what I mean. ﻿It's insignificant. ﻿And that means it's not a crime? ﻿I did not commit any crime. ﻿We'll decide that. ﻿So were you together or weren't you? ﻿Even if something happened ﻿it was with consent. ﻿Consent to do what? ﻿You said nothing happened. ﻿So now something did happen. ﻿Slow down. Tell us exactly what happened. ﻿There was an intimate situation. -Consensual? ﻿Of course. ﻿She hounded me. ﻿Can you prove it? ﻿Couldn't you say no? Did she threaten you? ﻿Look, I'm married. ﻿I have to protect my family. ﻿You had an affair. Why did she complain? ﻿Revenge. -For what? Did you promise her anything? ﻿She knew I wouldn't break up my family. ﻿You told her you couldn't be a couple? ﻿It was understood. -By whom? ﻿We were two adults with feelings for each other, ﻿not characters in some cheap novel. ﻿Okay, I get it. ﻿You had an affair, you both got carried away, ﻿maybe she wanted to break it off but couldn't? ﻿I wanted to break it off. She was getting jealous. ﻿How did you feel about the relationship ending? ﻿I wanted to protect her, I didn't want her "to miss the train" ﻿to be dependent on me. ﻿She claims she got carried away ﻿but when she wanted to break it off you forced her to continue. ﻿After a brief period of intimacy I realized it couldn't go on. ﻿One night she phoned, crying, ﻿saying she felt terrible. ﻿I went over, she sat down on the couch, ﻿poured some wine and said she felt awful. ﻿I wanted to go but she started to cry so I hugged her, ﻿she lay back on the couch ﻿and wrapped her thighs around me. ﻿After a few minutes I realized I should go. ﻿Did you have an orgasm? ﻿What does that matter? -Answer the question. ﻿Does it excite you? ﻿You don't want me excited. ﻿It was too much for me emotionally. ﻿It was a mistake, I admit it, but it was no crime. ﻿Who knew about it? -Nobody. ﻿Naturally. You knew you were commuting a crime. ﻿Researcher from the Academy of Science accused of sexual harassment. ﻿Maybe you misunderstood her. ﻿No way. ﻿Let's get this straight. ﻿Your employee admires you. ﻿You compliment her, desire her. -We were close. ﻿And only you make the rules. ﻿You know it's no ordinary affair. ﻿After a short time I wanted to break it off. ﻿Did she threaten you? ﻿No. -Did you threaten her? ﻿Of course not. -If you put a gun to my head, is that a threat? ﻿I suppose so. -Why? ﻿Maybe you think I like it. ﻿You were her boss. She was dependent on you. ﻿She was afraid. ﻿If she were afraid she wouldn't have come to the lab at night with a bottle of wine. ﻿This item has 67 comments ﻿51.

Should I be jealous? ﻿Feel whatever you feel. ﻿Why did you stay with me for 20 years? ﻿Why didn't you walk away? ﻿Hey, Yotam. -Mom, where are you? ﻿We might be late, ﻿I'll ask Ido's mom to take you, okay? ﻿When is dad coming? ﻿We may not make it to the game. -Not make it? ﻿Dad never misses a game. ﻿I promise we'll make an effort, honey. ﻿Why doesn't he answer? ﻿Hold on. ﻿Yotamie? Hi, buddy. ﻿Hit the court like a tiger. Don't worry. ﻿I'll be a little late. ﻿You mean the world to me. ﻿Bye, love. ﻿I feel bad for him. ﻿But I feel even worse for his kid. ﻿He should've thought of that before. ﻿Poor kid, it's not his fault. ﻿Idit? ﻿Hi, it's Merav, Yotam's mom. ﻿Can you take him to the game today? ﻿Thank you. Bye. ﻿Why don't we release him for his son's game? ﻿Her testimony is full of contradictions as it is. ﻿You want all the women's groups coming after me? ﻿He won't get off clean in any case. ﻿Who's fucking you? ﻿I see it excites you. -It makes me sick. ﻿Who is it? -How will it help you? ﻿Are you making this up? ﻿Why should I? ﻿Unlike you, I didn't break the law. ﻿How long did it last? ﻿Is it even over? -Does it matter? ﻿Don't I deserve a little attention? ﻿Wonderful. At least you're happy. ﻿Who made the first move? ﻿Who touched who first? ﻿Answer. That was the easy question. ﻿I started it ﻿but he was into it. ﻿This conversation is getting more and more pathetic. ﻿Stop it. Leave me alone. ﻿They're totally nuts. ﻿Do you realize what you've done? ﻿I didn't do anything to her. ﻿Now it all makes sense. ﻿What makes sense? I don't get it. ﻿I see right through him. -Actually, I believe him. ﻿You heard what she said, it was all consensual. ﻿She's confused. ﻿He's her boss. She's dependent on him. ﻿She probably made eyes at him. ﻿They had sex, she thought he'd leave his wife for her, ﻿but it didn't happen so now she's obsessed. ﻿I'm telling you, he fell for her and it turned his head. ﻿Probably made her promises. -That doesn't mean she wasn't into it. ﻿Not only wasn't she into it, ﻿it took her a long time to protest. ﻿That's why he had her fired. -I don't buy it. ﻿He cared about her. ﻿What are you trying to say? ﻿That the professor saved his family. ﻿He already got his punishment. ﻿He expects everyone to bow and scrape. ﻿I want an arraignment. -No, I'm releasing him. ﻿He's suffered enough. -No way, ﻿you're ruining my investigation. ﻿No, I'm ruining your PR. ﻿I'm releasing him for bail, ﻿and if there's trouble ﻿I'll mention who leaks to the media and who makes up evidence. ﻿Can you tell me what really happened? ﻿It's not the truth that matters, ﻿it's what you do about it. ﻿If you don't support him it'll all fall apart. ﻿It's up to you. ﻿He made his choice, ﻿it was hard but he chose you. That's how it all started. ﻿Look, I... ﻿I had a fling a few years ago, too. ﻿I was mad about her. ﻿I couldn't see straight. ﻿I dropped everything for her. ﻿My kids won't speak to me. ﻿They hate me. ﻿But you... ﻿If you stick together you'll make it through. ﻿You belong together. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Hello? -Noa. ﻿It's Merav Golden. ﻿Merav, I asked you not to call me. ﻿Wait, I have something important to say. ﻿What do you want? ﻿Why destroy us all? ﻿You were hurt? Let's talk it over. ﻿What are you trying to do? ﻿Help you. I understand you. ﻿I know exactly what you're going through. ﻿You do? How? ﻿Everything has repercussions. ﻿Think of your parents. ﻿Leave my parents out of this, okay? ﻿I'm trying to work this out, for your sake, too. ﻿You're trying to manipulate me ﻿but you don't really care what he did to me. ﻿Stop. How much money do you want? ﻿A million. -What? ﻿Dollars. ﻿You're mocking me. ﻿No, you're mocking me! -No, I'm not. ﻿I only want the best for all of us. ﻿What are you trying to say, Merav? ﻿You aren't stupid, Noa. ﻿If you managed to bring my husband down, you're smart. ﻿If nobody finds out we can work it out, okay? ﻿It'll be as if it never happened. ﻿Noa... ﻿Prof. Moti Samet ﻿Hello, Moti. ﻿Dedi, I just heard. How did it happen? ﻿I don't have a good answer. ﻿Your relationship with her was a mistake. ﻿You're right. ﻿I woke up too late. ﻿I'm sure it was blown out of all proportion. ﻿The press called, I refused to comment. ﻿Thanks, Moti. ﻿I'm sure Merav will understand. ﻿Noa? ﻿Noa, open up. I know you're there. ﻿Open up, I want to talk to you. -Go away, Merav. ﻿I'm not going anywhere. -You're looking fortrouble. ﻿Fine. Call the police. ﻿Don't be afraid. ﻿I want to talk to you. ﻿You aren't the only one who got hurt. ﻿Can I come in? ﻿Noa, let's stop this here. -I can't. ﻿You can. ﻿You're talented, you're smart, ﻿you're sexy, you have it all. ﻿Your life will go on. Ours is over. ﻿He didn't even apologize. I'm still just a plaything to him. ﻿You wanted it. ﻿You were in love. -Not true. ﻿What isn't true? ﻿Did he force you? Tie you up? ﻿Worse. He crushed me. ﻿Reality crushed you. ﻿You're creating a monster, ﻿you're hurting people who never did you wrong. ﻿Merav... ﻿don't blame me. ﻿I'm not looking for someone to blame. ﻿I've lived my twisted life with Oded for years, ﻿but you? ﻿Look, you created a world together. ﻿So much love and romance, he comes over, you drink wine, ﻿you fuck, more wine, you fuck again. ﻿He isn't even gone yet and you text him ﻿that you miss him, but he goes back ﻿to his boring, empty life. ﻿Tell me, ﻿if he left me for you, ﻿would you still have complained? ﻿He didn't lay off even when I asked him to. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Did he hold you like this? ﻿Did he stop you from leaving? -Stop it, Merav. ﻿No, Tell me. -Merav, that hurts. ﻿Did he force you to stay? -Merav... ﻿Let go. -Tell me! ﻿How? Did he hold you like this and force you? ﻿Did he rape you? -Merav, you're hurting me. ﻿I'm hurting you? Tell me what he did. ﻿He didn't stop when I told him to stop! ﻿He undressed me, I lay there like a doll. ﻿Like I wasn't there. -But you were in love. ﻿You wanted him to touch you, you waited for him. ﻿You're hurting now, I understand. I'm hurting too. ﻿He wouldn't let me go. I quit the study because of him. ﻿My whole life was ruined. ﻿Wow. ﻿Did I ever cross your mind? ﻿I didn't think so. ﻿Merav, please go. ﻿We're all in hell. ﻿It's up to you whether we stay there ﻿or you'll find a way out. ﻿Chairperson of the Women's Lobby: "Kudos to N. for not being afraid. ﻿"This is the only way to stop the exploitation of women." ﻿Don't worry, Dedi, we'll get out of this. ﻿How's Merav? -Great. ﻿Here's her chance to get even. ﻿Don't take it that way. She's in shock. Show some understanding. ﻿Sure. I understand everyone. ﻿We'll have to plea-bargain. ﻿If we don't, they'll go for the jackpot ﻿and accuse you of rape. ﻿What happened doesn't matter. ﻿Your truth, Oded, and the truth in this case, doesn't mean a thing. ﻿Sassy's dealing with everything, they'll release us soon/ ﻿Here, eat. -Thanks. ﻿You have to eat something, you haven't eaten since yesterday. ﻿Hey, Yotam. ﻿Why didn't you come? ﻿Dad was busy at work. -Where is he? ﻿Here, talk to him. ﻿Dad, it was an amazing game, ﻿I scored four points and two steals ﻿and I was the best on defense. Too bad you missed it. ﻿That's great, Yotamie. ﻿Are you okay, Dad? ﻿I'm fine. Well be there soon. ﻿What's the matter? -Nothing. Everything's fine. ﻿Okay, bye. ﻿I'm Merav Golden, Oded's wife. ﻿Oded would never hurt anyone, he loves people, ﻿certainly his research partners. ﻿He never bossed them around, he didn't feel like their boss, ﻿he didn't exploit his authority and certainly didn't exploit his student. ﻿People have weaknesses, ﻿but that doesn't make them sex offenders, ﻿criminals and rapists. ﻿Oded didn't rape or harass anyone. ﻿We're a family. We have children. ﻿Please, ﻿don't be so quick to condemn him. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I need you to sign a guarantee. ﻿He can sleep at home but he can't go out alone. ﻿We'll call you in for further questioning. ﻿Just hope there are no more complainants, Prof. Golden. ﻿Moti, I owe you an apology. ﻿It's been a year of hell. Torture. And to top It off, he kicked me out. ﻿I hope you understand. ﻿You have a meeting with the lawyer tomorrow at 11. ﻿Be strong. ﻿We'll get through this. ﻿It's not worth it. ﻿Go back to your lover. ﻿Will you stop that? ﻿Why not? ﻿Silly. ﻿If you don't get help we won't stand a chance. ﻿I had a stupid urge but it never took your place. ﻿Let's not talk about it. ﻿What do you need me for? ﻿Our lives are rotten. ﻿just don't start acting like a loser. ﻿Hey, Yotam. ﻿Mom.. ﻿Yes, honey? ﻿Everyone's talking about Dad. Why didn't you tell me? We planned to talk to you. ﻿All the kids know. What did he do? ﻿It's not what you think. -Then why did it happen? ﻿Everyone says Dad is a rapist. ﻿It's not true. Some nutcase decided to ruin Dad's life, Yotam, ﻿really. ﻿Dad, it must be a mistake. ﻿I know it can't be. ﻿Ignore them, Dad. Hapoel is playing Kiryat Gat tonight. ﻿Well order pizza and watch the game together. ﻿I'm waiting for you.
