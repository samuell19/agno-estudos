Is there a mosquito in here? Do you wanna drink more? I could go buy some. It's okay, Min-chul. I've drunk enough. Do you mind if I lie down for awhile? I'm tired. Yeah, go ahead. It's alright. Are you crazy? Stop it. It's alright. I said, stop! Let me... Wait a minute. Can you put something on before we do this? What? A condom. Huh? I don't have any. Over there... in my bag. Inside the zipper pocket. It's not in here. Give it to me. It should be there. That's weird. Do you want me to turn on the light? I'd better get going. Okay. Why are you sitting here when there's so many empty seats? Get away. I can't believe you had the balls to come. Why do you think I came? This isn't easy for anyone. Why are there so many things to fill out? You're so eager to marry me off. But I'm not paying for the registration fee. You pay it, Mom. Don't worry. I'll subtract it from your wedding fund. Educational background, college graduate. Age, thirty. You should note my actual age because my birthday hasn't passed yet. Twenty-eight. Occupation, physical therapist. Appearance, average. Wait a minute. Why am I only average? I look pretty good compared to others my age. Give it to me. Mom, you underestimate your daughter. Special skills... Can't you go any faster? I'm so hungry, I'm gonna go crazy. Can't you just walk? Can't you do anything right? Why are you starting again? Didn't you like my chicken stew yesterday? Just forget it. Do we have ramen at home? If not, go buy some. Let's just eat rice. I can quickly make it. I wanna eat ramen today. Just go buy some while I'm asking nicely. Okay. Did you fly back? Fly where? Wook. Why do you look so surprised? Did you see a ghost or something? What are you doing here? What do you mean? Is that something you say to somebody you haven't seen in four months? No, you should've at least called me and let me know that you're coming. How could you just show up like this? Do I need to announce myself before coming home to my own house? A year has passed, but this girl hasn't changed one bit. What are you doing? Nothing! You must be hungry. I'll go buy some ramen. Hey. Huh? I came out on vacation and I have to eat ramen? What the... nevermind, just go. Okay, I'll be right back. What's wrong with you? Shh! Be quiet. My grandma just arrived. She's gonna break my legs when she finds out that I'm living with a man. Really? What should I do then? You should go somewhere else and sleep tonight. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay? Okay, take good care of your grandma. I'll go now. But wait a minute. Shouldn't I go inside and say hello to your grandma? Go, go, just go. Okay, I'll go. Bi-ang! Here you go. I slept with my boyfriend's friend. We were drunk. But it's been weird ever since. It's not like I'm tired of my boyfriend or anything, but I'm starting to like this other guy. What should I do? It's driving me crazy these days. It must be very hard for you. But you need to figure out what you want. Otherwise, both men could get hurt. Do you know this feeling? I had a delivery van that I used to drive, and when somebody drove it without letting me know, I could always sense it and knew right away. Something just wasn't right. Whether it was the steering wheel or seat, I just felt something was different. Why are you talking about your van? Did something happen while you were gone? No, it's nothing. - Wow, she's not bad. - Give it back. Who's she? Is she yours? No, it's not like that. Then what is it? What is it then? Why don't you hook me up? You already have a girlfriend, you shithead. Dude, she's not mine anymore. Hey, let me call this girl. Why would you call her? You know that I have a way with words. Ah, fuck. What the hell! Asshole. I'm gonna dive in. Okay, we'll call you. Whenever you're going anywhere... I'm going your way. Rock and roll! We're looking for a vocalist. I've started, but can't see the end. Do you know what it means. My name is... Hiya... a virus that has lost its smile. Hiya... Hiya... Try it with your chin down. Hiya... a virus that has lost its smile. No, I don't mean push your chin down into your neck. Hiya... A virus that has lost its smile. Hiya... I need a strong vaccine. Do you wanna try it one more time? Yeah, I just arrived at the coffee shop. Of course I had my hair done. Hold on, Mom. Excuse me, are you Seung-hwan Oh? Yes, that's me. Hello. Mom, he just got here. Yes, I'll talk to you when I get home. Corporal Won-jae Park left on Wednesday for vacation. Didn't you call before you came? Hello? Hello, is Won-jae home? Oh, is this Hyo-jung? As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to you. Don't you think you went a little too far? You should've let him rest while he's on vacation. How come you're calling him out early in the morning and sending him home late at night? What are you doing? He's utterly exhausted. You're old enough to know better. Don't you think so? Isn't that your phone? What are you doing? Why are you so hard to get a hold of? I was in class. I see. Your class is more important than me. I guess you can expect to receive a scholarship. I'm bored. The others went out for the night and I'm by myself. Eun-suk, I'm seeing somebody else. What? Don't joke around with me. So I can't wait for you any longer. Let's break up. What the hell? You said you'd wait. Didn't you promise me you'd wait? I'm sorry that I couldn't keep my promise. Fuck! What are you talking about? Then keep your promise. Take care. I'm hanging up now. Hey, Jin-ah! So, I see that you came out on vacation without even telling me. Where the hell have you been? Do you know what your mom said to me today? She wants me to act my age. Why do I need to hear this from her? That's enough. Is there someone else? Why can't you say anything? So that's the way it is, huh? Didn't you say that I'm a burden to you when I come out on vacation? That's why I didn't call you. Now, you won't have to waste money on me either. What? Let's stop here. I'm tired, really tired. Tired? Do you think you're the only one who's tired right now? I'm tired too. I don't even know what I'm doing right now. Let's just end it. It's over. Can I help you? Bo-ram! Over here! Have a seat. You're really tanned. All soldiers are like this. You got prettier. This is my fellow soldier and we had the same vaca... That's right. Wow, you look so much prettier in person! Nice to meet you. My name is Wook. I hope we get along well. Min-chul and I became close friends ever since we trained together. And he talked about you so much and suggested that I should meet you. And I kept saying no, no... But since he insisted that I should meet you at least once... I thought it would be rude to refuse his request every time. Even though I was so busy today, I still came out to see you even though I didn't have time to change my clothes. Was this what you wanted to talk to me about? No, it's not that. He kept asking me about you ever since he saw your picture. Min-chul, I think I have to go now. Bo-ram, where are you going? Bo-ram! Bo-ram! - Bo-ram! - Let go of me! Let's talk. Let's talk. Are you really that stupid? You really don't get it, do you? Don't you know why I visited you last time and why I'm here right now? Don't pretend that you don't know what I'm talking about. I thought you would act differently once you found out. That maybe you would look at me just once. I thought about giving up more than a hundred times. If you don't like me, just say it! Yeah! Where you going? Come here! Don't you think you spent too much money today? Then you can pay for the second round of drinks. Second round? It's too early to go home. Do you have things to do at home? We're both lonely, so let's have another drink together. Alright, where should we go? Really? Hmm... what sounds good? How about wine? Shall we get married? What? Marry me! I'll think about it. What kinda reaction is that? I'm serious. Marrying me would be like winning the lottery. The lottery? Will you marry me or not? Will you marry me or not? Poor soldier. I bet he's got girl problems. Hyo-jung, wine? Rather than wine, let's have some soju. Really? I love soju! Who the hell is this guy you're seeing? What's he got that I don't have? Think whatever you want to. It's none of your business. Don't do this to me, Jin-ah. It's all my fault. Let's just forget about breaking up. No. I don't like this either! Let's forget it. I really don't know. If you don't know, then let's forget it. Do you remember this? They're the pills that I took when I missed you. Well, the medicine stopped working. I missed you so much, I couldn't stand it. Stop it, it's over. It's not over for me. I'll call you more often. I'll write more often. I have no feelings for you anymore. Please don't call me or write me anymore. Go! I beg of you! This is too hard for me. I know you're mad at me. But you can't end it like this. It's my fault. Can we just talk for a little bit? Look at me. I won't play music anymore. And it's uncomfortable seeing you. Bo-ram, this isn't what you want, is it? Please go. I was a little scared when I first slept with Eun-suk. But it got better and better. You're talking crazy. Remember, you couldn't make it to my birthday party last year because of your work? I forget. I was very lonely that night... and I realized why people have sex. I realized it for the first time that night. But it seems so long ago... I've heard enough. Let's go to my house, alright? This is something we should talk about at home. But I don't wanna go home. Kyung-sook. What? Let's go to the mountain spring. It's really nice there this time of night. It's really nice. C'mon, it's my birthday today. Eat well and live well. Fuck. Happy Birthday. Somebody must be very happy to celebrate her birthday with her new boyfriend. Hey, don't say those things about Jin-ah. She doesn't have a boyfriend. What are you talking about? The guy got exempted from military service. Hey Ki-sung, you saw him, right? Kyun-sook, let's just go. What? On your birthday last year, I got beaten like a dog by corporals because I was singing happy birthday to you by myself. But I was still happy because it was your birthday. Because I couldn't be next to you. But how the fuck could you do this to me?! Why? I need to get this off my chest. Stop it. Try to understand. He drank a lot today. - On your birthday last year... - I'm not drunk! - Did you... - I'm totally fine! I'm gonna go. Hey Jin-ah! Did you sleep with Ki-sung that day? What did she say? Hey, say something. Ki-sung! Spit it out! Why you son of a bitch! Hey... hey. Say it, bitch! Say it! Ki-sung! - Get up, get up! - Stop them! You call yourself a friend? How could you do this to me? Just because I wasn't around, did you feel free to take what was mine? Tell me! Tell me! Why am I yours? Yeah, I slept with Ki-sung that night! Because I wanted to. I know, it's my fault. But you weren't there for me. I did what I felt like. Do I belong to you? If I was something you could control, why couldn't you stop me then? Of course, I don't belong to you. I belong to myself. I don't even know what I want, so how can you say that?! When are you getting the deposit from your parents? They won't give it to me. Then what are you gonna do? I told you. You can't stay here that long. Bi-ang, I have something to tell you. What is it? Promise me that you won't be shocked. Why? Are you going to the army? How did you know that? You'll wait for me, right? You're driving me nuts! What's wrong? It's not working properly? What's wrong with this? Please, let me give it to you. No, it's alright. I'll give it to you. One, two, three. The bride's makeup looked good today. Hyo-jung, you should do your makeup there, too. I'll give you the money tomorrow. It's alright. It's not necessary between us. Between us? I should go introduce myself to your parents. I have time next week, would that work for you? What are you talking about? When did I say that I would marry you? Why do you keep saying such things? Hey, what's wrong with me? Where the hell am I? Shit. Let's see... If you're gonna leave like that. What do you expect me to do? If you're gonna leave like that I'm really think I'm going to cry. Say one word to me before you leave Bo-ram, let's do this together! If you really loved me up until now. You're the only one for us. - Don't forget this one word. - What the heck are you doing in front of my store?! You are the only one that I love. Oh, my love, just say one word before you leave. That you loved me up until now. Hey, have you seen me before? Private Ho-Shin Song! I don't know, sir. No, I feel like I've seen you somewhere. But I'm not sure. Have I seen your face on the Internet? Hey, Joon-myung, what's for lunch? Shit soup, sir. Shit soup, shit soup, every day, shit soup. Fucking shit soup. Delivery! Room number four! Second platoon, your last visitation of the year. Attention! Visitors, visitors, every day, there's visitors. Corporal Wook Huh, you have a visitor. What? Who me? You finally get a visitor with one week left to go. Hey, what are you doing here? What do you mean? I came here because I missed you. Bullshit, did your new boyfriend dump you and run away? What are you talking about? I was busy because it was my senior year in high school. So I couldn't pay much attention to you. Okay, but didn't you bring anything with you? I only had money for transportation. Why am I not surprised. Do you wanna eat some dumplings? Yes. You know how I'll eat anything. Uh my legs hurt. Why is this place so far? - Ho-shin! - Mom. Armies are normally far away. A distant place is the army. What's the matter? Attention! Hey, have a seat. Yes, sir! Mom and Dad, this is Corporal Wook Huh. Oh my gosh, it's so nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Please take good care of my son, Ho-shin, even though he's somewhat lacking. No, he's doing really well. Is that right? And because my hometown is also Pusan, I'm taking good care of him. Pusan? What part of Pusan? I'm from South Boomin town. South Boomin town? Oh my gosh! South Boomin town. Doesn't your niece live there? Who? Heng-ja? She's in Koo-po. It's Man-duk town. Below Man-duk Terminal. Then who lives in South Boomin town? Just be quiet. And this must be your girlfriend. Yes. Bi-ang, why don't you say hello? Hello. Bi-ang! Do you guys know each other? Ah, that's right... um, who are you? Nice to meet you. He looks Japanese. Then, did he shave his eye brows too? No, his style is not like that. If he's good looking then hook me up. I'll buy you something delicious. Let's all get together. Okay, I'd better get going. Did you get discharged? No, it's my last vacation. I see. Have you registered for your classes yet? Yeah. Try to avoid Professor Shin. He's pretty stingy. Alright. See you later. Okay. Bo-ram, long time no see. Han-na. I heard that you're now the vocalist for our band. If there was no one to sing, you should have told me sooner. How could you make Bo-ram sing? Have you ever heard her sing? What? I didn't think so. Things are looking brighter for us. Let's go in and get ready. Are you nervous? A little. Just do it as usual. Don't worry. Do you mind if I relieve some tension? Huh? I don't think that was enough. I'm sorry for not contacting you sooner. I also waited patiently to see you and took a part-time job while on vacation. You spent a lot of money whenever I came out. Even though I didn't look it, I felt really bad. This is the money from the army that I didn't use and saved until now. This is all I can do for you right now. I don't even know what I'm doing. Let's end it. Let's end it. Should I not come out then? Is that what you want? A lot of things have changed in the past two years. But I still believe that this is not the end for us. When I go back, I hope that there's still a place for me beside you. I love you. Bastard... Hey, let's go in. Hurry up, hurry! Hello. We're Peacock Green. I'm happy to be back after two years. Are you guys ready? Yes! Let's do it! Take care. Take care. Bye. Freedom, freedom! Hyo-jung! What is this, without even a word. Babe. Why? Do you think you can wait for me another four years until I finish college and get a job? What? Four years? No, maybe three years, three years. I'll definitely get a job within three years. But how old will you be then? Stop driving me crazy! Seriously! Hey, be careful! I almost fell. Hold on tight!
