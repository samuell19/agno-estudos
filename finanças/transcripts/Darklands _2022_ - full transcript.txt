(unnerving music) - Right. Oy! - [Son] Don't forget your ammo. (mysterious string music) - What's going on? - They canceled my interview. Mm. - At the last minute? - Yeah, well, this is what happens when no one knows who you are anymore. - That's bullshit! - Yeah, they read my writing, so. - Why'd they even call you in if they're not serious? - Something's gotta happen, Greg. - Don't worry. The right thing will come up. Shit heads. - Dad! No swearing! - Aw! - "That's such bullshit!" - Aye! - [Son] What's happening? - Oh, they canceled my interview, honey. - Screw them. - Oh, God! (Jamie laughs) - You're gonna miss the bus. - [Son] Actually, Mom, I think I'm coming down with something. - Uh huh. - I'm serious. Look, Mom, I'm being serious. Okay, this guy sneezed on me last night when I made him his coffees. - Oh. Asshole. Any danger of picking these up? - He doesn't tip anyone in the cafe. Just gets into his black convertible, he's a fuckin' asshole. - Mm. Luckily I never meet any of them in my job. Look, I can probably drop you off at school because I've gotta go there anyway. - Why? What happened? - Well, the principal said a couple of the buildings have been broken into. - What? Well, just tell him I've got barista's ear. - Barista's ear? - Yeah. From slaving at the cafe. The steam wand has really messed up my hearing. What? No school? I'm sorry, Mom. I really can't hear- - You are going to school. No school, no footy. - What? But I'm a public health risk. The guy sneezed on me. - [Samantha] Alright. Text your coach and tell me you can't come on Saturday. - Look at this, I can't. - Ugh, seriously? - What? Perfect. It's time for an upgrade? - $2,000, sure. - What, really? You're the best. Thanks. - No, I mean sure. I'll fix your old phone. You can order a new screen. And I'm still the best. - You got five minutes, Tim. - [Tim] Oh, can't, coffee. - Drink it in the shower. - I love ya. (calming music) Are you working all day or? - Yeah, I've gotta go... Well, I've gotta stop in at school with you first. - Hey, Sam. - Hi, Jeff. - What do you think? - Oh, they definitely used bolt cutters and a screwdriver in the change rooms. - Yeah. That's a step up from the graffiti, right? - Well, I can come back if you like and install some of those WiFi pinhead cameras that you connect through your phone or your laptop. - I don't think you understand school budgets. - Oh. - Yeah. Look, thanks. I've gotta go. - Okay. - Cheers. - See you later. - Bye. (eerie music) (gun fires) - Diane. Diane, are you there? (gun fires) - Shorts fired at Moondah Hills Secondary College. At least one shooter. Moondah Hills Secondary College. Active shooter. (gun fires) (woman shrieks) Tim. Tim, pick up! Shit! (gun fires) (dramatic music) (water splashes) - Actually... - Oh... Wrong. - No, he just can't do it. - You can't? - We're that age now. Ex-boyfriends or girlfriends have died. - Yeah, and that's the point. If they're dead, they're outta the wank bank. - Mm, I don't know. There's one or two guys from high school I'd keep in the bank dead or alive. - Oh! - Hey, hey, hey! You watch out, missy. (laughing) And you know what? Greg here, he's sidelined right now. - Kolt. - Jamie burnt his dick with the hair dryer. (laughing) - Oh, what? Jamie! - When I got outta the shower. - It was a cold morning. I thought I was helping. - Yeah, not helping, not helping. - [John] How far away were you standing? - We measured, about 12 and a half feet. - Oh my god. - [John] Mate. - [Jamie] Sheesh. - [Greg] What? - Look at this. - That's your hometown. - Does it say how many? - Yeah, over 20 kids. - Oh! - [John] Jesus Christ. - I know her. That cop. It appears the officer did not approach the gunman. Yeah, Samantha Romans. That's who it is. - She would've known all those kids. - She didn't even get her gun out. - Yeah, well that happens more often than you think. - Why? - Well, they don't wanna go in alone. They wanna wait for backup. Or there's not enough intel. Or, you know, they've had too much, but they just freeze. - I mean maybe in the army, but this woman's a country cop. Worst she's seen is a cracker up a cow's bum. (John chuckles) - You know this story's gonna totally fuckin' explode. - Don't recruit her. - No, but hang on. She's got a box seat. Like, this could totally grow the site. We can revamp the MarTech. I can like totally optimize the shit out of it. - These are kids, Jamie. - Yeah, I know. I know. Kolt's right though. You know? I know what it's like in that town, I'm in a pretty unique position. - Would they even let you get to her? - What, the cops? Yeah, I'd get to her. (unnerving music) (knocking) - Come in. What's happening with Tim's body? - He's still at the school. He'll be moved to the morgue in the morning. - I should probably get back down there. Maintain some kind of presence. - No, no. The place is crawling with tech guys. We're here to talk about what happens from here. - Well, Tim will be buried with his dad and his sister. - No, with you, Sam. After you sit down with professional standards, you're taking four weeks off. - No, I'm fine. - To start with. - My son's been murdered. What am I supposed to do? - Have you eaten yet? - No, I'm fine. - Oh, come on. Let me buy. You need a hot drink, get some sugar into you. You brought your gun home. Sam. - Um... - Where's your service weapon? You said you didn't fire it. - I don't think so. - You don't need to worry, Sam. We're gonna take care of this. You know I've got your back. (unnerving music) (car honks) (dog faintly barks) (tires screeching) (car honks) (dog barks) - [Man] You stupid bitch! You let him die! (tires screeching) (computer beeps) (unnerving music) (dog faintly barks) (car honks) (dog barks) - Have you slept? - No. Just need to get through Tim's funeral. - Sam, remember you once told me you thought about driving fast down a long, straight road, and steering off into a tree? Is that what's happening now? - No. - Okay. I'd like to try a technique to help you get through this. When did you feel safest in your life? Sam? - I don't know what to do without Tim. - [Therapist] When did you feel really safe? Maybe as a kid? - I don't know. Bringing in the washing. - [Therapist] With your mom? - Yeah, being helpful. Doing what I was told. I couldn't get blamed or hit for doing that. - Okay. I want you to imagine that there's a smallish circle on the floor in front of you, okay? Stand up. Now... I want you to step into the circle. Now, dive deep into that memory. Feel that safety. - I sold it. $135,000. - What? My God. - They will syndicated it everywhere. - With your name all over it? That's crazy. - Totes crazy! - What's happening? - $135,000! - That's so good. - That's great! - [Greg] How'd you get her to say yes? - They are so excited about this article. We can go to Paris with this. ♪ We've got lots of money ♪ ♪ We can go to Paris ♪ - Yeah, but you are going to be very sensitive about how you handle it, right? - I am back, baby. (ominous music) (Samantha breathes heavily) (door slams) (message beeps) (Samantha breathes heavily) (eerie music) (nails scratching) (Samantha gasps) (cell phone buzzes) - Bitch. - Hm? - She won't talk. - I thought she already agreed. - Oh, she was close. - Jesus, Jamie. - Well, she's got to talk. This is my career. - She does not have to talk. Not if it's not in her interest. - Oh, fuck her interest, Greg. It's her interest that got those kids killed. I mean, who's looking after the kids anyway? Not the court. Do you know, just yesterday, some guy gets three years for killing his girlfriend's baby? - Okay, calm down. - Do you know why I didn't get that job, Greg? Because I stopped to do what my body is supposed to do, have kids, and I am still getting punished for it. I am literally banging my head against a brick wall, throwing all of my energy at a website that hasn't paid off, just so I can pretend to still be a journalist. - We have everything we need. We- - I know, I know. I know others do it tougher than us, I know that. But I'm not a journalist anymore, Greg, am I? I mean, I'm letting myself down, and I'm letting you down. - You are not. - Oh! I can write this story, Greg. I can do this. I am speaking to this woman. I'm gonna push this thing to its limit. - [Reporter] In Canberra, speculation continues that there may be a leadership challenge. Despite the opposition's claims that party unity is at an all time high, factional leaders are said to be taking head counts and considering their next moves as the... More locally, the Moondah Hills community continues to mourn after a shooting that took the lives of 24 people, with dozen more being injured. Growing anger has focused on the actions of policewoman Samantha Romans. She was on school grounds at the time of the shooting, and allegedly failed to act. The motive of this tragic shooting is still unknown. Reporter Zoe Grange has more from Moondah Hills. (dramatic music) - [Zoe] Excuse me, Sergeant Truglio. Why didn't the police intervene and stop these people before they could harm anyone? - Oh, look, I feel for everyone here, I do understand the anger. - [Zoe] At the police for being bystanders? - All right, you've door stopped me. The Commissioner's gonna answer all these questions at the press conference. - I'm asking you. You're the boss there. People are going through hell. - Uh huh. And officer Samantha Romans is on leave. - On paid leave? While there's no inquiry? - No, there is an inquiry. And she won't be paid when she's charged. She's failed, and she will be charged. It's not the department that's at fault, it's not me, it's one individual. She's let everyone down, the whole community. She's broken our trust. She's not gonna be with us much longer. (unnerving music) (text message dings) - You've all seen the news about the shooting by now. What actually happened in my hometown at my old school. So, my first question is about this woman. Police officer Samantha Romans who was right there, she was on the spot, and she did not act. I've researched her, I got her number, and she won't talk to me. Why not? All the years women have been fighting to get into these jobs, having to be twice as good as a man, and it pisses everyone off that she puts her hand up for a gun and a badge and she doesn't use them. So now every second Tweet is that women can't be effective. And she let her own son die. I'm a mother. I would do anything for my children. So, what happened, Samantha Romans? Why did you stand by and let your own son die? So what happened, Samantha Romans? Why did you stand by and let your own son die? So what happened, Samantha Romans? Why did you stand by and let your own son die? (unnerving music) C-O-double N-A-R-D. Jamie Connard. Thanks, mate. - Hey, why didn't you head off the Newstone? Take your leave up there? - No, this is where my family lived. - Yeah, but, you know... Sometimes I reckon you feel things in a house where people have died. - Yeah, I like that. The feeling that David and Caitlin are here. Like David's been watching over Tim, like a dad should. - All right. Look, I'll do a drive by when I can. Apply some lights and sirens. Keep those fuckers away. - Yeah, just drop in and say hi. I've still got that bottle of scotch. - Yeah. Once it's died down. - You could come by tonight. - Yeah, maybe. (eerie music) - Does everyone at the station feel the same? - I don't know, mate. I'm just keeping my head down. I saw the Sergeant hanging you out to dry on TV. - He told me he had my back. - Sorry. I know you guys were close once. - Yeah. Her name's Jamie Connard. - Yeah. Okay, sorry. Jamie Connard. (pen clicks) (melancholic music) (phone rings) (unnerving music) (phone rings) (baby cries) (window shatters) (Samantha yelps) (man shouts) (tires screeching) (Samantha bangs) - Please, stop. (phone rings) Please, stop. (ominous music) (objects clanging) (phone rings) Please, stop! (Samantha sobs) (phone rings) - Hello? Hello, Samantha Romans? (baby faintly cries) - Please, leave me alone. I'm begging you. - Sam. This is the platform you need. (baby faintly cries) (unnerving music) (phone rings) - Jamie Connard. - Samantha. - Thank you. - Hello, again. You there, Sam? - Talking to you won't change anything. - Look, I really think it will. If we open up the other side of the story, help people to understand. - You don't know who I am. - I'd like to. I know that cops are people of action, you know, less talking more doing, but I think that you're probably different. We're both women. I'm a mother, like you. - You're a blogger. That's dangerous. - Journalist. - You bet your safety against your sanity every day, right? - What? - You're a good mother, huh? - I try. My kids know that I'm there for them. And we do lots of community things. You know, we had an exchange student from Japan and- - Sorry, I'm being unfair. You've probably had some Barry at work put his name on one of your articles, right? - Are you taking the piss outta me? - You think a princess like you can understand me? Sitting in your comfortable little home office, all pretty and passive. Afternoon naps when it all gets a bit too much, blaming men. You wouldn't even fucking eat if it wasn't for your husband. - You have no idea about my life. - Every single moment a cop sees something. A kid gets shanked for their mobile phone. Someone puts their name on your article? For fuck's sake. - All I'm saying, Sam, is that if you answer my questions, that will stop people asking them. - You've got a family. A son and a daughter. - How the fuck does she know that? - Was that a question or a statement? - I saw that thing you sent from your shitty blog calling me gutless. - What did you expect? This is what one side of the story looks like. - Don't call me again. - Sam. - It isn't safe. - What's not safe? I don't understand what you're trying to say, Sam. You're not very articulate, are you? - Hurt people hurt others. - What the fuck, Jamie? - What? - Why'd you have to go in so hard? - I didn't. - She... She threatened you. - Oh! I've been monstered by much bigger assholes. She'd joke, anyway. How about, "Wow, you actually got the woman talking." How about a little bit of support? I'm trying to bring some very serious money into this house, Greg. - That woman is not right. What's that thing you sent her? - [Samantha] It isn't safe. - Well, you're not gonna use that. - Well, of course I am. I mean, I'm a journalist. Can we agree to that? That she puts her hand up for a gun and a badge and she doesn't use them. So now every second tweet is that women can't be effective. and she let her own son die. Did you see the number of views? 1,970. - This is fucked up. You are harassing a woman whose world is falling down around her. - And I am your partner, not your passenger. I'm not riding on your coattails. I don't need you to be able to eat. - Have I ever complained? We are very comfortable. Just write your novel, get it published. You're so much better than this. - Really? Where? Where's the proof? You're the one with all the awards. You're the world's best kids book illustrator. This is my turn, Greg. I can write something of quality here, or are you somehow sorry for this woman? - Jamie! - You heard the way that she spoke to me. - It's a tragic situation. But people fail all the time. People who are just trying to be better than what they were. I'm not even sure I wouldn't be one of them. But Samantha Romans is not gonna move on from this. She's lost her son. She's probably gonna end up in prison. - Oh... Well. You do the right thing, because you're a much better person than me. - Is that your shitty way of saying you're not gonna stop? - She thinks I'm a princess. Oh. She has no idea what's about to hit her. - I'm asking you to stop. Jamie. Leave this woman alone. (unnerving music) (text message dings) (dramatic music) - And closing the sale. Okay, okay. Because I understand guilt. (unnerving music) (text message dings) Late is good. (unnerving music) (text message dings) Gotcha. (Jamie exhales) (eerie music) (Samantha exhales) (cell phone rings) Samantha? - [Samantha] I just wanted to give you some background before we talk. Would that help? - Yes. Sure. Thank you. - My brain's been a bit fried. I apologize for some of the things I've said. It's been a difficult time. I wanted to show you a photo of Tim. One where he's got his face. His beautiful face. - Yes. Look, I am sorry about that. But we just, you know, we just needed to start talking. - I think Tim kind of kept things real for me. He was my anchor. - Mm, yes. My daughter does that. My son drives us a bit mad. I mean, they're both pretty cheeky, to be honest. - Did you get the photo? - Yes. Yeah, I did. Nice looking kid. - You like him straight off the bat, right? - [Jamie] Yes, you do. - He was an incredible footballer. Got sick. Pneumonia last year. Missed the whole season. I thought he was gonna die. - I'm sorry. - We don't care as people, do we? We don't try to imagine what others have gone through. - No, no, you're right. We don't. - You used to work for some good newspapers. - Yes. Yes, I did. - [Samantha] And Greg has kept his nose clean? - Ah... (Jamie chuckles) Oh, you looked us up on the police database. - Well, we have to get to know each other. - I'm interviewing you. - Well, I need to know who I'm letting into my house. - [Jamie] Ah. You sound worried about me, Sam. Nervous. - Oh, a little. - I'm not gonna screw you over. I promise, this will just be you and me talking, just heart to heart. - When Tim was born, it was like the start of a bright new day. - Mm. I know what you mean. - Yeah, with your two at your stage... You're only halfway through. It's like midday, your stage. The sun is still high in the sky. For me, it's gone. It's like 10 o'clock at night. There's nothing but darkness ahead for someone like me. Sorry, I keep ending up in my own head instead of focusing on what we have. - What do we have? (ominous music) (door opens) (bottle sprays) - Cooper, Kerri! - I didn't wanna do this. But Jamie kept calling, and now I'm 100% in. I've got your kids.

(cell phone buzzes) (eerie music) What's going on? - Jamie. It's late to be calling. - Where are they? - Who? - Where are my husband and children? - Are they dead? - What? (eerie music) Okay. All right. What are you saying? Are you saying you don't wanna talk to me? That's fine. I promise, we're done. I will leave it alone. I'll leave you alone. - I don't want your 15 grand. - Oh, fuck. - You've hurt them, Jamie, with what you've done. - What is this? - Call the police if you're worried. I'll know if you do or if you don't. (unnerving music) (text message dings) (Jamie pukes) (Jamie breathes heavily) (Jamie dry heaves) (cell phone rings) You collapsed. The body does that sometimes. Come on, you're wasting time. (Samantha claps) Get up. - I can't... - It's terrifying what's out there. There's literally thousands of them who believe that it's their right, to break in and steal your stuff, rape you. They really think that your personal private things are theirs. My son was murdered, and you thought it was your right to break into our lives. - No! - I begged you. - And I'm sorry. - And you lied about the scar. It's surgical. From what? - I... I used to smoke dope, and I stole from a girl at a party. She pushed me through a table. - No, you're a thief. - [Jamie] No! - You're wasting time lying to me, Jamie. Don't make me drag every fucking detail out of you. We don't know how long your family have got in those boxes. (Jamie sobs) - Please. Please just tell me where my family is. - It's gonna be a long night. In a few hours, we'll start to wonder what's really real. - For fuck's sake. You've made me understand. I am just a normal person. Please. Please do the right thing, Officer Romans. - Officer? Stop looking out the window, Jamie. Look at your phone. (text message dings) (Jamie sobs) - Is he... Is he alive? - I used to watch Tim in his cot. To check that he was okay. I think I saw Cooper moving, which is good. I don't wanna see anyone hurt. - God. I am calling the cops! - Tonight on Jamie Lives Large. Three family members found dead in their graves. (Jamie sobs) - They're just children. - I was heading down a long, straight road, and you made me steer my whole life at you. You make this happen. You're the brave hero, come on! You get out there and save them. - Well, do you want me to do something? - Oh, you stupid, ignorant bitch, yes! You have to try to save them, while I try to kill you. This is your chance. - I'm just a normal person. - Oh, I hope you're not. And I hope you're not a coward like I am. - I'll never find them. - You're gonna let your whole family just die? Okay, you can talk to them. Greg. This is your wife. Greg. The kids are buried too. (Greg yells) Greg. Jamie and I talked a lot behind your back, and I told her what would happen if she didn't leave me alone. And she didn't stop. So look what she's doing to you now. - You fucking monster! - Oh, oh! Policewoman, monster, child killer, coward. Who the fuck did you want when you called me? Greg! Jamie is still standing in your living room calling me names. Me, I'd be out there trying to save you. But she's still standing around, with one thumb up her ass, and the other one in her mouth. (unnerving music) (Jamie breathes heavily) Kerri, Kerri, Kerri. Where is it? (unnerving music) Oh, Jesus. (Jamie breathes heavily) Pick up, Carl, please. Try a house, call, I don't know. (unnerving music) Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus. Oh my god. I'm coming! (Jamie yelps) Fuck you! Fuck you. (gun fires) (Jamie sobs) (tense music) (text message dings) - [Samantha] Greg. Jamie can see you now. She's got a gun like mine. She'll be brave now, should be able to tackle anything. - Please, let me talk to him. Let me talk to him! - Are you ready to hear my side of the story, Jamie? Get ready to write all this down, you don't wanna miss any of the juicy details. I saw my son in the morgue. Shot in the throat, and in the face, and you made a joke about it. And that's when I knew, Jamie. I knew that you had to live this. - How many times do you want me to say to you that I'm sorry? - That's all right. You're just scared. - No, no, no. No, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - Don't worry, I'm gonna show you what's on the other side of your fear. I'm gonna hook a finger in your eye to drag you through it and make you fucking stare at it. - Please. Just tell me where my family is! (Jamie breaches heavily) (tense music) (text message dings) I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming, I'm coming! (Jamie screams) No! No! Wake up, baby, wake up! No! (Jamie breathes heavily) (Jamie speaks incoherently) (somber music) No! No! Come on, come on. (Jamie sobs) (somber music) No, no! (text message dings) (Jamie breathes heavily) (Jamie sobs) - [Samantha] Kerri, wake up! Come on, Kerri, wake up- - No, Kerri! - Oh, sorry, Jamie. I've been trying to wake her up for an hour. There was a lot of chloroform. So, the interview. Come on, Jamie. The interview. There's no time for crying. Let's do the interview. Come on. Kerri! - Where is she? Where is she? - "Where is she?" Or maybe she fainted. Did she faint? Probably the chloroform. Get in the car. (Jamie sobs) Go. Go on, baby. (Jamie sobs) Aw. (Jamie sobs) (cell phone rings) - Jamie. I'm imagining how you're feeling. The despair, the terror. The sickness. It'll come and go. Hey, did you do any research about my time in the army? Afghanistan. We occupied a house once. There was a target in there that we thought we killed, but then I heard his breathing. You know that wet sound? Went on all night, pretty much. The sergeant wouldn't let us kill him, put him out of his misery. I felt sick about it, but then that passed. Most of the guys even managed to get some sleep. (Jamie sobs) (text message dings) (unnerving music) - Fuck! Fuck. (ominous music) (siren blares) (dog barks) (unnerving music) - Sam, are you in there? (knocking) Sam? Who's there? - Wait, just wait. Who are you? - Senior Constable Diane Mahood. Identify yourself. - Okay. I'm coming out, but you gotta see this. There's dead bodies. - [Samantha] What? Name. - John Kolt. I'm just here for an interview with Samantha Romans. That's all. - What bodies? - Skeletons. I don't know how many. - Right, out here. Hands up, on the porch. (tense music) Over here. What interview? - [John] With a friend of mine, about the school shooting. - [Samantha] Right, ID. - Samantha made threats against my friend, and now her husband and kids are missing. And there are fucking dead people in the wall, so why don't you go in and take a look? (both grunting) (Samantha groans) (gun fires) Fuck. (tense music) (cell phone buzzes) - [Samantha] You're dead. - What the fuck. (cell phone rings) - What the fuck have you gotten me into? - [Jamie] She wants to kill me! - Yeah, she's a fucking psycho. There's fucking dead bodies in the wall. - Kolt. (Jamie sobs) Cooper... Cooper's dead. - What? - She fucking killed him! And now I'm trying to save Kerri and Greg. - Jesus Christ, Jamie. Call the cots. - Kolt, you really have to help me. I mean, you've been in the army, fuck! - All right, all right. Where are you? - I'm driving to Moondah Hill Cemetery. I mean, she said that they're there. I've got a fuckin' gun, Kolt. - [John] What? From where? - From her. She's screwing with my head. - She's gonna try and fucking kill you. She's going to kill you. - Oh, Jesus. - All right, meet me at the cemetery. All right, you give me the gun you've got. Mine's out of bullets. - Okay. - [John] Okay? - Okay. - What the fuck? I'll call you back.

You okay? - Ah, no, not really. How's the station tonight? - Quiet as. - Hey, you know that journo, Jamie Connard, I asked you to do a background check on? Well, I dunno why, but she's she's offered me 15 grand to kill her husband and kids. - What? - Yeah, I know, it's... Look, I told Truglio, and he said that he'd follow it up, so- - Why's she calling you? - Oh, I dunno, mate. She had something about she knows where I'm from or something. Look, she's off her head. He hasn't done anything about it, 'cause she called me again. So I told her to meet me at the northern entrance of the cemetery. - Here? Our cemetery? - Yeah, yeah. Look, if I was on the job, I'd make the arrest, but do you want it? - Sure, yeah. - Okay, okay. Well, just be careful, 'cause I don't know how dangerous she is. (Julie sobs) (unnerving music) - Oh, come on, fuck. (Julie breathes heavily) (unnerving music) Come on. (Julie slams) (phone rings) I'm here. - [Samantha] Where? - I'm entering the cemetery like you told me. Where are they? - I think maybe you mean "where am I?" I told you I would kill you. - [Jamie] I want my family back. - [Samantha] I feel different now, Jamie. I feel lighter. - Where! - [Samantha] Among the tombstones in freshly dug graves. My husband and daughter are buried here too. - Where are you? - I can see your headlights. You just keep driving, slowly. Oh, you're texting someone. Your friend won't answer. He's dead. - Bullshit. Bullshit! - [Samantha] John Kolt won't answer. Greg and Kerri are in the far corner. You've still got time to save them, you'll be a hero. - My child is dead! - And so are mine. I'm not your entertainment. My life is not your entertainment. (Jamie sobs) - Fuck. Fuck. (Jamie grunts) Is that you? The lights? - You just get out of your vehicle. Hold out your gun so I can see it. - You come and get it! - Oh, coward. - I'm gonna fucking kill you! - [Bianco] Police! - Oh, yeah? Well, do it. Don't talk about it. - [Bianco] Put down your weapon! (gun fires) (Jamie screams) (Samantha laughs) (Jamie sobs) - Oh, fuck. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my god, fuck. Shit. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. (Samantha chuckles) (Jamie breathes heavily) (Jamie screams) - Oh, you ran away, Jamie. Well, at least you're safe. Listen, I've got something to show you. Just when you think it couldn't get any worse... It gets worse. Look, Jamie, it's you. - What? - You're on the National Crime Database, and a few other places. You're famous! - What have you done? - You're the story now. Well, not long to go, Jamie, and it'll all be over. (Jamie sobs) You're crying. Yeah, I agree with you. You're not gonna make it. So, is this interview over? Are we done? Are you gonna send me the $15,000? Or maybe I should just drive my van to your lovely house and fill it up to the value of 15 grand. You can come and help if you'd like. It's your house, after all. Not talking? You feeling the loss? (Jamie sobs) - You're just gonna let them die. - It's almost that time of night now. Sometimes I've had waking dreams at this time of night. I love it like this. Driving alone at night, watching the white lines appear in the headlights. So even. So regular. Another one. Another one. Do you know what my dad did, Jamie? When I was a kid? I stole a few things. I was about 14. Some perfume, makeup, things that we couldn't afford. My dad sort of roughed me around a bit. Then he parked his truck on my dog's tail, and I had to listen to it crying for me all night long. My mother was terrified of him. And she took that out on me. With my kids and my family, I wanted it to be different. You try to break these things, these patterns, but the stuff that they've put in you, it just sticks. (unnerving music) It's just you and me now, Jamie. On the road, in the dark. Watching the white lines. Jamie, talk to me. - Yes. - I want you to imagine me. I want you to feel what I'm feeling as you're driving back. This is important. I wanna tell you something I've never told anyone. - What is it? - My husband, David. David was on his motorcycle. Caitlin was on the back, it was raining. They hit a tram track and slid. David slammed into a pole and broke his hip. Caitlin was thrown off the bike and hit by a car. (Jamie sobs) You're lying in bed, can't sleep. It's so late. Your husband's got his back turned to you. You can't sleep because he's crying. It's beyond grief. When Caitlin died, something unlocked in him. He fell into a hole that he couldn't... He couldn't climb out of. I thought having Tim would fix things, but it just made it worse for everyone. He used to tell his parents all the time that he wanted to die. And then one day you realize... You realize that he's relying on you. Your love for him. So you get up. You go to the cabinet. You return with a gun. It's so late. You're so exhausted. You don't know what's happening. You're handing the gun. He pushes it back towards you. He wants you to do it. He puts his two hands around yours... (tense music) And he stares at you. And keeps staring at you. And the last line between us... Has gone. (tense music) (gun fires) You don't know whether you're falling apart, or something deep within you is coming together. And I thought it would be quieter. But the sounds just got louder. His grief, her crying, and I couldn't stand it any longer. And so I went to rescue them. And I brought them home so that they could watch over my son. (baby cries) And every day... That's how I want it for you, Jamie. To live inside this little circle with me. (Jamie sobs) To live everything I've lived. With a husband, his grief. He's just stuck in your mind forever. The choices you made can't be undone And nothing can help. (dramatic music) (tense music) (seatbelt unbuckles) (Jamie breathes heavily) (ominous music) (Samantha grunts) (Jamie sobs) Turn over. You're just as I thought. A face that's gotten away with far too much. Stand up. (Jamie sobs) Garage. Jamie, what's this? Greg's over there. - Greg! Greg. - He might have passed out. Why don't you knock? - Greg. Greg! - He can't hear us, Jamie. - Greg! Greg, I'm here, I'm here! (Greg yells) - [Samantha] Jamie, Jamie! It's almost over, it's almost over. - Where's Kerri? - [Samantha] Oh, oh, she's over there. - Kerri, we're home. Time! (Jamie sobs) - But you will need these. - You horrible fucking bitch! Kerri, Kerri! Mommy's here. (Kerri squeals) - [Samantha] Jamie over there. - Kerri, wake up, Mommy's here. - You see that phone? If I call that phone, then the whole place blows up. (Jamie sobs) - I just need to get it over with. There's nothing I can do. There's nothing I can say. You let those kids die at the school, you don't give a shit who dies! - Do you need to know what it feels like to be forced to choose? (Jamie sobs) Greg. Jamie's only got time to open up one of the boxes. She's got maybe, what, 45 seconds? One of you, only one of you can live. Greg, Greg! If you can hear me, you just nod. Greg. (Greg yells) - Greg! - Kerri, Mommy's trying to work out who she loves the most. (Kerri squeals) Mommy, Mommy. You have 45 seconds to decide. So, Greg, I think this whole place is gonna have to go up. Think fast, Jamie. 20 seconds. 20, 19... 18, 17... (Greg sobs) Fuck it, we'll all go. (Jamie screams) (Greg groans) She ran, Greg. She's out there, at the end of the street. - How could she let her own son die? How could she let the little Cooper die? - Where is he? - Well, you'll have to ask Jamie. - Ah! (Greg groans) (tense music) Kerri! Kerri, Kerri. - I want you to know what it's like to shoot someone. - Let her out! - Greg, put it on. Or you'll just be one more dead man for me to forget. Jamie's already shot Officer Bianco, so she's got residue on her hands. Greg! Put the glove on! If you wanna make her pay... You take that off, and you get rid of it. Greg, see? You see? Oh, look. Here she comes, here's Jamie. Jamie! Oh, there you are. You never really know the deepest part of yourself until you're face to face with it, do you, Jamie? How could I let my own son die? It was such a beautiful day, Jamie. You know that school. You know that school on a beautiful day. And I heard shots fired. (gun fires) And then when the fear comes, it's like you're watching yourself. It's like you're not really in your body. The kids running everywhere. (dramatic music) (gun fires) And then I saw Tim. And my body just shut down. I couldn't stand, I couldn't think, I couldn't... And then he saw me. (dramatic music) And then a girl appeared, with a shotgun. And she was looking at me. And she saw me see Tim. And he just stared at me, hoping that I would save him. (dramatic music) (gun fires) It's bad enough knowing who you really are. But when the people who you love find out... (dramatic music) (gun fires) (Greg groans) - Greg, Greg! Kerri! Greg, Greg, Greg, Greg! (both sobbing) Oh, get her out. Get her out, get her out. (Jamie sobs) Oh, Kerri. - I'll kill you! (Jamie screams) - Greg, Greg. No, Greg! - Get away!
