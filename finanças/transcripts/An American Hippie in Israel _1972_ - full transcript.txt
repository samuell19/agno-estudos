(easy going music) (continuous gunshots) (bombs) (continuous gunshots) (bombs) (continuous gunshots) Female flight attendant: May I have your attention please? In a few moments we will be landing. Kindly fasten your seat belts and refrain from smoking. Thank you. (Mike yawns) (Mike yawns) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (plane landing) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Mike: It was a nice flight, thank you. Man in suit: Thank you. (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Mike: May I help you? Woman in leather coat: Thank you. (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Mike: Ok, thank you. (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (cars keep driving past) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (cars keep driving past) Mike: Heading to town? Elizabeth: Yes. Mike: Thanks. (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song fades out) Mike: The name is Mike. Elizabeth: My name is Elizabeth. Mike: Thanks, thanks for stopping. Elizabeth: Where are you from? Mike: I'm from New York, United States of America. Elizabeth: I hear it's quite a place. Mike: It sure is. Elizabeth: Are you a hippie? Mike: Well, you might say so, right on! Elizabeth: Why are you a hippie if I may ask? Mike: Well, I just feel better this way. Elizabeth: Do you know anyone in this country? Mike: No, naturally I know you. Elizabeth: Are you going to stay here for a long time? Mike: Well, that depends if I find what I'm looking for. Elizabeth: What are you looking for? Mike: Pretty girls. (Mike and Elizabeth laugh) (screeching brake) Mike: Watch out! Elizabeth: Look! Mike: I know those two characters. What the hell do you want from me? Didn't you guys have enough chasing me around the world? What did I do to you? Why do you turn up at every place I go? Who sent you? Scum of the earth. Shitheads. Next time I see you, I'll bust your ugly faces open. (car door opens) (car door closes) (engine revving) Sorry. Elizabeth: About what? Mike: About that ugly scene. They're after me and they could've hurt you. Elizabeth: Who are they? Mike: Don't know, everywhere I go I run into them. And I don't know why they are bothering me of all people. Elizabeth: What do they want from you? Mike: I think they want my life. Elizabeth: But why? Mike: That's exactly what I don't understand. Elizabeth: This is where I live. Mike: Thanks a lot. Elizabeth: Where are you going to go now? Mike: Don't know. Elizabeth: Why don't you come up to my place. Have a cup of coffee, rest a bit. Then we go out into town. Mike: Yeah, that's far out! (car doors open) (car doors close) Elizabeth: Make yourself at home. Mike: Thanks. Elizabeth: I'll fix a cup of coffee. Coffee is ready! Mike: Thanks. That's really nice of you. Thank you. Elizabeth: You're my guest. Mike: Hmm, the coffee is swell. Elizabeth: Thank you, would you like something to eat. Mike: No thanks, I just had some chow on the plane. Mike: Nice pad you got here. Elizabeth: Thank you, it belongs to my folks. They're abroad at present. Mike: What do you do with your time? Elizabeth: I'm an actress. Mike: An actress? Pretty cool. I used to go to plays quite a bit in my day. Well last one I saw must have been at least five years ago. Elizabeth: I've just been offered a part in a play I didn't like. I haven't answered yet. That's why I'm not working. Mike: Theater any good in these parts? Elizabeth: There are some good actors. But the general standard of theater isn't so high. Mike: And that's how you make your grub? Elizabeth: Oh no, I don't have to work for a living. I just love acting. Mike: Hope I get a chance to see you in action. Elizabeth: If you stick around long enough. Mike: Might be a good chance of that. Elizabeth: What brought you to this country of all places. Mike: Well, I've been bumming around Europe for the past two years. In and out of almost every place. In Rome I met this fellow who has been in these parts. And he said it was an interesting country. So, once I had my fill of Rome, I hopped a plane and here I am. Elizabeth: So that's how you wander around every place. Actually, why do you bum around the world without any purpose? Mike: Who said I got no purpose? Ok, let me tell you something baby. You must have heard of the Vietnam war. (gunfire) Man, I fought hard for two years. Two years of living hell. All I saw was death, killing and acts of terror. And things that the sickest mind couldn't imagine. And the worst of it all, the orders. Can you imagine, taking young people and telling them, you have to kill the enemy, and if you don't do it the enemy will kill you. What I couldn't understand was why, why did I have to come all the way from the States to shoot people who I never knew? And why should I come all the way from the States, to fight and die in a country that's not mine? I killed my first one at 19. I stopped counting after that. I killed with my bare hands, I was like an animal. That's the way I was taught to behave. You understand, I was ordered, I was forced to do things that I didn't want to do. They turned me into a murdering machine! You understand, me at 19 a murdering machine! (gunfire) You might not believe this, but at 19 I was still a virgin. Yeah, virgin. Hadn't slept yet with a woman but I killed, I killed God knows how many. Buddies of mine died right next to me, gasping their last breath with: "Why, "why do we have to die here?" Now you know why I bum around. I'm trying to run away, run away from this stinking world. From the society that turns us into messengers of doom, into robots! A push on the button and we're forced to run to our deaths, a push on the button and we shoot people, a push on the button and we're turned into wild animals. You fools, stop pushing buttons. You fools. Fools. Fools. Stop pushing- I'm looking for a place. Far away from everything. A place where I can live with a bunch of people who think like me. Without anyone telling us what to do. A place where we can do our own thing. Elizabeth: Can I come with you? Mike: Are you sure you really dig what I mean? Elizabeth: Yes I am. Mike: Alright. You'll help me to find the others? Elizabeth: I'll help you. Let's get dressed, come on. Mike: Let's wait. Elizabeth: Come on, oh! (Elizabeth laughs) Mike: Come on, stop it! (Mike and Elizabeth laugh) Mike: Heeeeereeeeee we go! (Mike and Elizabeth laugh) (gentle guitar and woodblock music) Elizabeth: Let me go, let me go! Noooo! (Mike and Elizabeth laugh) (Elizabeth laughs) (Elizabeth laughs) (fountain spewing) Mike and Elizabeth: Hi, hi! (Elizabeth laughs) (Mike makes various sounds while jumping) (Elizabeth laughs) (gentle guitar and woodblock music) [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] (gentle guitar and woodblock music) (everyone is shouting and laughing) (everyone is shouting and laughing) (everyone is shouting and laughing) (everyone is shouting over each other) Mike: Come on! Hurry up, come on! (everyone is shouting and laughing) (whistling) Come on! (the duo starts playing the 1970's folk song) (applause) Beautiful. You're beautiful. You're just beautiful people. Thank you, thank you all for coming. Man, I assume that our outlook in life is the same? And that's why we lead the same kind of life. Because, that's how we want to live. All this is good for us. But we're still living in an environment that strangles us. That's why we're not living the way we really want to live. And the way we really could live. And I mean, an absolute free life. In an absolutely isolated place, far away from this civilization and culture of violence. Therefore, man, let's get organized. And find a place in which we can live as we see fit. Without clothes, without governments and without orders. Got it? Everyone: Yeah!!! Mike: Do any of you people know a place where we can go? Long blond curly man: Two days ago, I was in the south. About 20 kilometers south of this town. There was this isolated little island, it's not that far from the shore and completely desolate. It's the ideal place for us. Woman with black hat: What are we waiting for? Let's get on down there where we can live and be free! Free, free! Everyone: Free! (lots of cheering) (piano based hippie music) (car pulls up) (car doors open) (car doors close) (piano based hippie music) Mike: I know these creeps, they're after me. Let's get them! (gunfire) (footsteps) (footsteps) (car in motion) Murderers! Murderers! (sad guitar music) (car doors open one after another) (car doors close one after another) (sad guitar music) (brakes) Listen, from now on we're one family. And everything that we planned in a group we're going to do. We're going to do it exactly the way we intended to do. We'll be free. We'll laugh. We'll love. We'll do it in the name of all those that wanted to live with us. But can't. Francoise: But don't forget that Komo doesn't speak English. Mike: Could you translate it for me please. Francoise: Ok. (Francoise translates Mike's words into Hebrew for Komo) Komo: Ok. Mike: We're going to start doing our own thing. Right now. To appreciate. To love. And take advantage of every minute of freedom. You're beautiful. You're really beautiful people. (slight moaning) Everyone: Yahoo! (car engine revving) (gentle woodblock music) (Mike laughs) (trumpet and woodblock based happy music) (smooch) (everyone laughs) (smooch) (trumpet and woodblock based happy music) Komo: [Hebrew - unintelligible]. Mike: You're beautiful. (Elizabeth laughs) Elizabeth: I love you. (Mike laughs) (everyone laughs) Mike: You're beautiful. (everyone laughs) (trumpet and woodblock based happy music) (car in motion) (Francoise laughs) (everyone laughs) (car in motion) (trumpet and woodblock based happy music) (brakes) (both car doors slam shut) Come on! (whistling) (general crowd muttering) Elizabeth: It's beautiful. (Elizabeth laughs) (general crowd muttering) (goat bleats twice) (cars driving past) (car doors close one after another) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (car slips in sand) (Komo laughs) [inaudible] (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (Komo laughs) (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Mike laughs) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Mike: (yawning) I think I'm going to flake out for a moment. (Mike yawns) (water dripping) (Komo, Francoise and Elizabeth laugh) Elizabeth: Morning! (Komo, Francoise and Elizabeth laugh) You're missing the wonderful view. Look! (Komo, Francoise and Elizabeth laugh) (everyone laughs) Mike: Komo! Beautiful. Truly beautiful. Far out. (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Beautiful, beautiful. (Mike laughs) Francoise: [Hey man]. This heat is killing me. Mike: So take off your clothes darling. Francoise: Yeah, that's not a bad idea. I think I will. Mike: Go on! (goat bleats) (everyone laughs and the gloat bleats) Mike: Wow wow wow wow wow wow, what a body. Komo: Yahoooooo! (Mike laughs) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (goat bleats) (Mike laughs) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (goat bleats) (Mike emulates the sound of a goat bleating) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (car door closes) (car door closes) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (car in motion) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (brakes) (car door closes) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Mike: Beautiful. (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Komo: Mike, Mike, Mike, habib! Francoise: Look! Mike: Here we are! (everyone cheers) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (car doors close) Mike: Man, this is really fantastic, really out of sight! Francoise: It's great. Elizabeth: Beautiful, isn't it. Francoise: I'm already in love with this place. (Komo and Francoise inaudibly whisper to eachother) Komo: We're coming, we're coming, we're coming! Mike: Well, let's not screw around. Let's cross over the ridge. Go down to the shore and sail to the island right away. Come on. Everyone: Yeah, come on!! (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (waves crashing into the shore) (oars paddling through water) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) (oars paddling through water) (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Mike: Freedom! Free! Everyone: Free! Elizabeth: Freedom! Francoise: Free! Komo: Free! Mike: Freedom! Everyone: Free, free! (1970's guitar and woodblock based folk song) Mike: Man. Finally we are free! Everyone: Free! Mike: Man, let's go take a dip in this beautiful water! (everyone cheers) (cheering, laughing and water splashing) Komo: Mike! (cheering, laughing and water splashing) (loud cheering by everyone) (laid back party song playing) (fire crackles) (tin can clang) Mike: Man, how does it feel to be completely free at last? Man, I feel really turned on. I feel like I'm flying in the air and laughing at the whole world. (Francoise translates Mike's words into Hebrew for Komo) Komo: Yeah. (Komo says something in Hebrew to Francoise) Francoise: Wonderful feeling. Komo: Yeah, wonderful feeling! Wonderful feeling! (everyone laughs) Elizabeth: I want to tell you, that I love you all. I've never felt so good in my whole life. (Elizabeth laughs) Francoise: I love you too, all of you. And this is the happiest day of my whole life. It's beautiful to be free here in such a spectacular place. Everyone: Yeah! Komo: Wonderful feeling, wonderful feeling! (everyone laughs) Mike: Man, I think we made it. I want this place to serve, as a living symbol for the whole world! Everyone: Yeah! Mike: We'll show the world, that it's possible to live without wars. Without violence. Without machines and buttons. The only sounds that are coming out of this place will be those of song, joy and laughter! Everyone: Yeah! (applause) Komo: Wonderful feeling! (everyone cheers) Komo and Mike: Wonderful feeling! (everyone laughs) Mike: Cheers. (Mike sighs) Let's say something to the whole world. World, you're so full of shit. You're so badly contaminated, that it's impossible to find a corner free of smell. Especially the stench of dead bodies. That's why I hate you. There are millions that hate you. Millions that want to escape to another place. A place in which they can breathe air, pure and clean. But you bind them. Kill them. Torture them. The day of reckoning will come. You will be doomed. You will destroy yourself with your own hands. You stinking world. (applause) Elizabeth: World. I don't have much to say to you. But I'll tell you only this. I love Mike and believe in him. And if he says you're doomed, you better watch out. (applause and Komo cheers) Francoise: World. You're a world of contempt. You're a meek world. You're a bad world, bad, bad. Good riddance to bad rubbish. (applause and Mike cheers) Komo: World. Wonderful feeling! (everyone laughs) Wonderful feeling! (applause and laughter) (mumbling amongst the couples) (pebbles being displaced by feet) (frisky laughter and sexual intercourse) (sad guitar music) (distant sounds of flowing water) (sad guitar music) (Komo yawns) (sad guitar music) (distant sounds of flowing water) (sad guitar music) (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) Francoise: He says the boat is gone. Mike: The boat disappeared. Tell us, what happened? (Komo says something in Hebrew) Francoise: He got up, did some exercises, then suddenly noticed that the boat is missing. Mike: That's bad man. The tide at night probably washed the boat away. But there's still a possibility that the boat is on the island. I know, let's split in groups. Each group will go to a different direction and will meet back here right away. Ok? Francoise: Ok. Elizabeth: What are we going to do now? Mike: Don't worry baby, everything is going to be all right. Let's move it! (sad guitar music) (water flowing) (sad guitar music) (waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) (waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) Mike: See anything? Francoise: We didn't see anything. And you? Elizabeth: No luck. Just sea and sky. I'm getting hungry. Francoise: I'm hungry too. Mike: Ok, ok, don't sweat it. Let's get back and see what we can do. (sad guitar music) (feet displacing small rocks) I have an idea. Listen, I'll swim to the other side. Take the car into town, buy all supplies we need. And speed back as fast as possible, ok? Elizabeth: Ingenious! (Elizabeth audibly smooches Mike) Francoise: Very good, can you swim well? Mike: No sweat darling. (Francoise translates Mike's words into Hebrew for Komo) Komo: Very good. Very good! (treading water) Elizabeth: What happened? Francoise: I don't know. He's swimming really fast. (Komo screams in Hebrew) Francoise: Sharks, sharks! (water being displaced) Mike: Bastards. (feet displacing small rocks) That was a bummer. Elizabeth: I'm so hungry. What's going to happen now? Mike: We got to get to the car. Francoise: But how? Elizabeth: Maybe a boat will pass by here. Mike: No chance. In a desolate place like this. Francoise: Maybe we can build a raft. Mike: That's cool. Trouble is, there ain't no trees going around baby. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Francoise: Yeah, we're in pretty bad shape. Mike: Yup, pretty bad. If it wasn't for those damn sharks, everything would be ok. Maybe they'll go by tomorrow. Then I can swim to the other side. Elizabeth: I certainly hope so, otherwise we might end up dying of hunger and thirst. (water faintly gushing in the bottle) Francoise: If we sit here like a bunch of lame ducks, we don't stand a chance of getting out of here. We'll have to do something. Mike: You're right. Come on Komo, let's go and hunt for some food, ok? Komo: Ok. Mike: You stay here. (Francoise says something to Komo in Hebrew) (sad guitar music) (waves crashing into the shore) Well, that's better than nothing. Komo: Ok, ok. (waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) Mike: Blasted creeps. Get out of here you bastards! Go to hell! (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: What? (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Sorry, I can't get you. Listen Komo, we're in a very serious situation. All of these bloody creeps around, isolated island, no food, nothing, no water, the girls will go mad. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I can't get you man. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Listen, I tried to swim, SWIM, to the other side. But there are sharks, you know, SHARKS. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: The sharks are there! (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I can't swim to the other side and get the car. (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I don't get you. I really don't get you man. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Listen, the girls, Francoise and Elizabeth, yes? Komo: Yes. Mike: You don't have to say anything, any word to them, you know? (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: About our bad situation. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I can't understand you. Listen, Elizabeth, yes, you understand me, Elizabeth. (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: What are you shouting at me? (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: For God's sakes. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: What are you shouting at me for God's sakes. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Shut your mouth, yeah. Cool it baby, cool it. Listen, we have to solve our problems, together man. (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Komo, I don't speak Hebrew, I'm sorry. I can't speak it. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Listen, what you're talking for me is like Chinese. I can't understand a word you are saying man. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I can't get you man. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I'm sorry I can't get you. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: To do a thing? I'm trying to do the whole... You make me mad. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: What? Listen, let's cool it ok? And we'll think about trying to cross to the other side, to the car. Listen, to the car. Komo, Komo to the car. We'll think it over, yes? (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) Mike: Don't shout at me for God's sake. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Shut up! (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I told you once Komo- (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Cool it! (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: We'll have to do with it you know, we'll have to eat it. (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) Mike: We have nothing else to eat man. (Komo says something in Hebrew) (limpets crack on rocks) Mike: Ok From now on, I'm going to do it in my own way yeah? (Komo says something in Hebrew but gets cut off by Mike) Mike: And you will do anything I'm telling you ok? (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I don't understand you sorry. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: I don't speak your language man. I don't speak it, I'm sorry. (Komo says something in Hebrew) (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: You and me? (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Yes but the sharks are there man. How can we swim? (Komo says something in Hebrew) (footsteps) Elizabeth: What did you bring? Mike: Fresh limpets. Francoise: I can't stand the smell. Mike: You got no choice baby. Elizabeth: You'll never get me to eat one of those. (Komo says something in Hebrew) Mike: Don't bugger around. We've got to eat, what we got to eat. (Komo spits and says something in Hebrew) Elizabeth: Under no circumstances will I eat one of those. Mike: You'll have to, it's better than nothing. You saw that I ate one and nothing happened to me. Elizabeth: It simply disgusts me. Mike: There's always a first time baby. Elizabeth: I just can't. The very thought of it makes me sick. Francoise: A while back I ate some snails, but nothing as bad as this. Mike: Ok, ok. If nobody digs them I'll eat them all. (distant waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) (faint waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) (faint waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) (waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) (waves crashing into the shore) (sad guitar music) Sharks are still around. As long as they are down there, I can't swim to the other side. Elizabeth: Boy, am I thirsty, I'm so thirsty. Francoise: What's going to happen to us now? Elizabeth: Yeah, what's going to happen to us now? Mike: Shit. This is a really bad scene. (waves crashing into the shore) Francoise: I'll tell you what's going to happen to us now. We're going to dry up in the sun. We're going to rot away. You sucked us right in with your smooth talk. You lied to us. You got us into this mess, now get us out of it. You hear?! Mike: Cool it. Francoise: I want to eat and drink. I don't want to die here in this stinking place. And since when were you appointed leader anyway? Mike: You're going too far baby. Francoise: Don't give me any more of your bullshit. I'll talk as much as I like. Big shit. Mike: Shut your ass. Francoise: Shove it man. We've had about as much as we can take from your lip. Mike: Shut up! Francoise: You've got us into this rot. I hate you, I hate you! I hate you!! (soft thump) (struggle and shouting) Francoise: You bitch. (struggle and shouting) Francoise: Bitch, you bitch! (struggle and shouting) Mike: Come on, let's get out. Elizabeth: Let me go, leave me alone, let go of me! Let me go! (Mike grunts and Elizabeth shouts) Mike: From now on, this part of the island is mine! And if you drag as much as one foot, in this part, I'll kill you! (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) Francoise: He will murder you! (Elizabeth screams) (various grunting noises and shouts from everyone) Elizabeth: Let me go, let me go, let me go. Francoise: Let go of me! (Elizabeth and Francoise scream) (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) Mike: I'll kill you! (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) (struggle and shouting) (Francoise shouts at the top of her lungs while Komo grunts) (Elizabeth shouts at the top of her lungs while Mike grunts) (heavy breathing) (Elizabeth gasps for air and cries) (heavy breathing) (Komo grunts) (hard thump) Mike: OOF! (Elizabeth gasps for air) (footsteps) (Komo shouts something in Hebrew) (struggle and Francoise cries) Komo: Wait, wait, wait. (struggle and Francoise cries) (Mike breathes heavily) (Mike grunts and Elizabeth lets out screams of fear) (soft thumps and Komo grunts) (Mike grunts and Elizabeth lets out screams of fear) (Komo grunts and Francoise lets out screams of fear) (Mike grunts and Elizabeth lets out screams of fear) (Komo grunts and Francoise lets out screams of fear) (Komo grunts intensely) (soft rock thumps) (Elizabeth moans) (soft rock thump) (soft rock thumps) (Elizabeth moans) (soft rock thumps) (rocks slamming into each other) (Komo grunts) (soft rock thumps) (Komo grunts) (soft rock thumps) (soft rock thumps) (rocks chafing) (rocks filing) (rocks filing and Komo grunts) (rocks clanging) (rocks filing) (Komo grunts) (Mike grunts) (rocks filing and Komo grunts) (rocks filing and Mike grunts) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats faintly while rocks filing) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats faintly) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats) (goat bleats and heavy breathing) (Mike grunts) (goat bleats and everyone grunts) (goat bleats and everyone grunts) (goat bleats and everyone grunts) (goat bleats and everyone grunts) (shouting, struggle, grunting, screaming and gloat bleating) (footsteps) (Mike breathes heavily) Mike: AAAAAAAAH, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
