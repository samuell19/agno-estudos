All aboard! All aboard! - Morning. - Special one today. Blimey. What have you got there? Wouldn't you like to know. Just arrived, milord. There's one from Buckingham Palace. Heavens. But we really need to cut back until the farms repay the investment. And we must make a plan for the roof. Well, this won't help us to economize. What is it? The king and queen are coming to stay. What? During their Yorkshire tour? That's it. Just for a night. They'll spend one night at Downton and then go on to Harewood for a ball. While they're here, there's to be a parade of the Yorkshire Hussars in the village. Is there any chance Henry might be back? Well, I doubt it. I'll send a telegram. But there's a motor show in Chicago that I know he cannot chuck. Tom, you're keeping your enthusiasm under control. Is this the Irish patriot making a reappearance? I know you find my opinions highly entertaining. I suppose they'll send people to check that Mrs. Patmore - isn't a Russian spy. - Mm. Will you tell them downstairs, Barrow? - I'll see to Her Ladyship. - Yes, milord. A royal luncheon, a parade and a dinner? I'm going to have to sit down. - Oh, what about Mr. Branson? - What about him? Well, he's a republican, isn't he? Should Mr. Carson look in, no one is to say that word in front of him. I agree with Mr. Branson. I don't like kings, either. I suppose that makes me a republican, too. Are the English allowed to be? Two weeks to get ready? Golly. It's quite an honor. It is. But if I know anything about royal visits, we will never stop changing our clothes. I've just been on a buying spree, which is good. Madame Handley-Seymour is making me a ball dress. - I'll get her to hurry it up. - Have her send it here. - How are things otherwise? - Oh, you know. I've got a luncheon for 30 today in aid of the lifeboats. Or is that tomorrow? Anyway, it's in aid of something. Sounds like business as usual. I'll see you soon, darling. You know I can bring back as many vegetables as we could eat. - Yeah, I like to keep busy. - Yeah. How have they taken the news up at the house? Daisy's singing "The Marseillaise." So no surprises there. Oh, what's the matter? I thought you'd be pleased. I am pleased. The visit is a great honor. But members of the royal and imperial household are coming to Downton who will have visited the greatest houses in the land. Blenheim, Chatsworth, Arundel. Does Mr. Barrow know what he's taking on? Why should it affect you? You're not in charge anymore. Now, come in for your lunch and let me get back. All right, sir, here we are. This will do very well. Thank you. The Lady Bagshaw, Your Majesty. Good. We'll go to the 1844 Room as soon as they're here. Do sit down. I've just received the plan for the tour of Yorkshire, ma'am. Yes. It's just been finalized. I think we'll enjoy it. I didn't realize we would be staying at Downton Abbey. Only for a night. There's to be a parade and a dinner, and then we go on to Princess Mary at Harewood. I just wondered if I might, perhaps, go straight to Harewood. Lord Grantham is my cousin, and the two families have... fallen out. Or at least we might if I were there in person. And what would cause this quarrel? Lord Grantham's mother believes her son should be my heir. Old Lady Grantham can be very hard to resist, as I am well aware. Exactly, ma'am. But, surely, they need to know if their hopes are to be disappointed. I wish I knew if they like simple food or fancy. I can't think they'll want simple food. With that sort, don't they like sauces and everything velouté and frappé and smothered in cream? "That sort"? He's the King of England. There's only one of them in the world. "That sort," indeed. Don't plan too much. Not until we know what's expected. Well, I know what's expected of me... food. You, too, Daisy. So less philosophy, more elbow grease. - Is the pudding ready? - It is. Oh, Daisy, take the soufflés out of the oven while I find me specs. This country needs a shake-up. Ah, you should run for parliament. Why not? Lady Astor's done it. And so an under-cook from Yorkshire is bound to follow her. Well, you've got to have big dreams. But do you have big dreams, Andy? I've not offended you, have I? - Why do you say that? - Well, for a start, you never talk about the wedding anymore. We'll get wed when we're good and ready and not before. But, you see, I am ready. Take those up before they collapse. Maud Bagshaw is coming to Downton? Yes, as the queen's lady-in-waiting. Oh, my goodness. Why so surprised? Who is she? Well, she's a cousin of your father's. We'll-we'll discuss it later. You're not to make things awkward. How's it all going? Well, Mary's got it under control. Hardly. There's so much to do. Who were those men measuring on the green as we came past? They're building the dais for the queen at the parade. - Oh, how exciting. - Seems rather a waste of money. Oh, here we go. Isn't that what the monarchy's for? To brighten the lives of the nation with stateliness and glamour? To quote Tennyson, "Kind hearts are more than coronets, And simple faith than Norman blood." Will you have enough clichés to get you through the visit? If not, I'll come to you. Thank you, Barrow. And, now, you were gonna tell us about Lady Bagshaw. Is she a very distant cousin? No. Her father was my great uncle. Then why have I never heard of her? Because she chose to cut herself off from the family. - Do you know the reason? - Maybe. See, I believe she means to cheat your father of his rightful inheritance. She has no children. Your father is her nearest relation. I won't have her put on the spot. You're plotting something. I see a Machiavellian look in your eye. Machiavelli is frequently underrated. He had many qualities. So did Caligula, not all of them charming. What are you up to, Granny? Well, ideally, I would like Maud to see your father as the son she never had. Will she be the mother I never had? Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit. - Oh. Hello. - Mr. Molesley. It's very late for you to be out. Is it true? Is what true, Mr. Molesley? Mr. Bakewell said that you'd warned him that there was to be a royal visit. Well, now I know who not to trust with a secret. That we should deserve such honor. Not you, too. I am disappointed. - Ignore her. - I wonder, do you think I might be allowed to slip on my livery again? Would the school let you? Oh, they'll give me time for this, I promise. Let's wait till we know our orders. What about it, Mr. Barrow? Will you let me wait upon my king and queen? Uh, well... That's us. Good night, Mr. Molesley. When we're done, shall I fetch Johnny - or will you? - I can fetch him. How exciting. - Thank you. - They're all mental. All this fuss for a man and woman we don't even know. No, never mind that. I wanted to tell you. I've had some ideas about what to serve at your wedding. Stop going on about my wedding. We've only a few days left, so I spoke to Her Ladyship, and she's agreed our normal rules should be suspended. We won't clean a room if a family member is using it, but, otherwise, all restrictions are lifted. No detail should be left undone, however small. I want every surface in this house to gleam and sparkle by Thursday. Blimey. Can I have your attention, please? Uh, for this afternoon, Their Majesties' butler, Mr. Wilson, will be coming over from Raby Castle with a lady's maid and a valet. To give us our instructions? With the royal servants, are we to wait on them? That is what will be made clear. I won't be waiting on any valets and lady's maids, thank you very much. Before we get hot under the collar, let's just wait and see - what they have to say. - Amen. Mr. Branson. Can I help you, sir? It's really you I came to see. - Oh. Well, how can I help you, Mister...? - Chetwode. Major Chetwode. Am I right you're Mr. Branson, Lord Grantham's son-in-law? - I am. - Oh. The, uh... the papers tell me the king and queen will be staying at Downton Abbey during their tour of Yorkshire. Well, if it's in the papers, it must be true. Yes. Great honor. Although, as an Irishman, you may feel differently. I know when my parents-in-law have been paid a compliment. Well, there's to be a military parade, I gather. How do you... how do you feel about that? What do you mean, how do I feel? Only you didn't say whether you support them, the... king and queen. I support Lord Grantham. Very neat. Until we meet again, Mr. Branson. Ah, Barrow. They said you'd be in here. Heavens. We can still put on quite a show when we need to, I'm glad to see. Has it all been cleaned? More or less everything's been done to a basic level, milady. But we haven't done the final buffing-up. Why not? I was waiting for Their Majesties' butler. I thought I'd ask his advice on what to use on the table. Really? Can't we decide what we lay on our own dining table? Front doorbell, Mr. Barrow. Please, go. Milady. Greetings, Mr. Wilson. Welcome to Downton Abbey. Uh, this way, Mr. Wilson. The royal butler's terribly scary. Barrow looked like a rabbit in front of a cobra. Oh, dear. Should I go down? They know what they're doing. Do they? They're hideously behind. There's a mark on the Blue Room carpet we can't shift. I have no chairs for the parade. And we haven't even decided on the footmen. I'm going to have another cup, if no one's coming up to serve. This is nice. Princess Mary wants us for tea tomorrow at Harewood. Ugh, I've got so much to do. I wonder if that means the young couple have taken over the big house. They're hardly "the young couple." Well, he isn't, anyway. She always seems quite shy to me. A shy royal? Is that an oxymoron? Anyway, we're going. Right. I will return to Raby Castle and come back to Downton in advance of Their Majesties on Thursday. But His Majesty's valet, Mr. Ellis, and Her Majesty's dresser, Miss Lawton, will stay on, if that is convenient. Or they can put up in the village. No, we'll find them rooms. Then Monsieur Courbet, the chef... E-Excuse me. - Mr. Courbet, the chef? - That's right. We'd be very grateful if you could make the kitchens ready. So, what should I order? Nothing. He will bring it all. And we don't cook any of the food? Um, cook for the servants. Monsieur Courbet won't have time for that. Oh, I see. That is something to look forward to. Calm yourself, Mrs. Patmore. If it's the way these things are done... Mrs. Webb and four footmen will arrive with Monsieur Courbet the day before. Who is this... Mrs. Webb, is it? She is the housekeeper. She will also bring two maids with her. The housekeeper? While Their Majesties are here. And the maids? They will make the beds, clean the bathrooms... that sort of thing. I see. So, my maids and I will not be involved in the preparations? You mean, during the stay, you'll be the butler, and... Excuse me. I am not a butler. I am the king's Page of the Backstairs. So, our staff has nothing to do? I'm sure they can be useful. But how can they eat and get dressed at Raby Castle if the chef and the valet and the maid are all here? We have two of each. The principal valet and the principal dresser will arrive in advance of Their Majesties, who bring an equerry, a lady-in-waiting, two detectives and two chauffeurs. The other chef goes from Raby to Harewood. Four footmen go with him, and the other four come here. Do you all understand me? You can hardly heckle Lady Bagshaw in front of the queen. Well, I'm just trying to prevent a crime. - Who says it's a crime? - I do. Oh, and you're an expert in the matter? I am an expert in every matter. You must have some idea why she doesn't want Robert as her heir. I have none. He is her closest relative. The family have held Brompton for three centuries. But she wants to give it to who? Charity? The dogs' home? Well, I would have thought the family had enough to worry about. That's not the point. Well, very well. We must try and discover her reasons. Well, what possible reasons can there be? Well, that's what I intend to find out. - Carson. - Oh, milady. Please come in. This is an honor. I don't want to be a nuisance, but I need your help, Carson. Barrow just isn't up to the task. - Milady? - He won't clean the silver. - Or he won't let Andrew clean it. - What? He says the page of the... thingummy - will choose which pieces to use. - I see. The truth is, he's in a sort of trance. Won't you help me? I feel I'm pushing a rock uphill. I'll be there in the morning, milady. Don't you worry. You're a treasure, Carson. That's all there is to say. I'll see myself out. - You could never refuse her anything. - Mm. And what about Mr. Barrow? Mr. Barrow can like it or lump it. Then I'm afraid he'll lump it. We have supper after the upstairs dinner, so you've plenty of time. Thanks. How does it work with two valets? Well, I prepare His Majesty's clothes and uniforms for Downton. Then, when Mr. Miller arrives, I get the stuff for Harewood ready. Then I head back to London and prepare for their return. - It all overlaps. - So, Mr. Miller's the one who actually dresses the king? Unless he's ill. Then it's me. Is he often ill? No. I think it's rubbish. They impose, they demand, and now we're to be made nothing in our own house. It's very disappointing, I won't deny it. This water's not too hot. Have they all been having baths? How should I know? Mr. Barrow, don't you think you should speak to His Lordship? - About what? - Well, it's not right, surely, for us to be humiliated in this way. Well, what could he do about it? Is the staff always ridden over roughshod whenever royalty come to stay? Why do they bring so many servants with them? Maybe it's because they go from house to house around the county and they need to know things are done the way they like. - As if we couldn't manage that. - We're not footballs, Mr. Bates, and we don't deserve a kicking. But what are we to say to Barrow? After all, he's done nothing wrong. He's done nothing at all. That's the problem. But it feels very unfair. Oh, I see. - So it's now. - I've sent down for Mr. Barrow to join us, milord. You wanted to see me, milord? Mr. Carson! What brings you here? Well, this is the thing. Carson is going to move back into the house for the royal visit. What? You are coming back here as butler when I am the butler here? Yes, uh, that is... Can I ask how long this has been planned, milord? Well, I wouldn't say it's been exactly planned. Because I don't quite understand where it leaves me. - Well, you can be a sort of... - With your permission, I'd prefer not to be a "sort of" anything, milord. I will surrender my position for the duration of the visit, if I must, and serve you again when Their Majesties have gone, if you so wish. - Please don't think that... - By the way, the boiler's playing up, and there's no hot water. God, that's all we need. Now, Barrow... Not to worry. The plumber will soon have it mended, milady, and we'll bring water jugs up to the bedrooms tonight and in the morning. It can't be that hard. We did it for 300 years. Thank you, Carson. Well, that went well. Will you sack him? No. As a matter of fact, I was quite interested. I never thought of him as a man of principle before. I'll have to tell him I'm only ordering for the servants' hall. I'm afraid I've got his hopes up. Aha! Oh, speak of the devil. Come in, come in. I was just saying you'll be wanting - to finalize the order. - Were you, indeed? Honestly, no one in the village - can talk about anything else. - Of course. Oh, now, I know it's a bit of a liberty, but I've made a list of all the ingredients of your favorite dishes. I know them well enough after all these years. But some things will have to be brought in, so we should really get on with it. Oh, well, I appreciate everything you've done, Mr. Bakewell... My heart is fit to burst, I don't mind telling you. I shall have fed the king-emperor from my own shop. If only my father were alive. He'd be so proud of me. He would. Well, I-I'm sure he'd be proud of you anyway, Mr. Bakewell. Oh, no, no, not like this, no. This is the peak of my career. Well, the peak of my life, really. Everyone's so jealous. Oh, now, I've put ticks next to the ones I think you'll go for. - Now, the thing is... - I'm guessing the luncheon will be for around a dozen. Of course, the dinner will be larger. Let's say 30 or thereabouts? You'll correct me if I'm wrong. - Well, you see... - You're not wrong, Mr. Bakewell. But we'll say if the numbers change. The pavlova's not realistic. We'd be safer with a charlotte russe. We can do most of the work before. And I shall be serving! Think of that! ♪ I've danced with a man who's danced with a girl ♪ ♪ Who's danced with the Prince of Wales ♪ - ♪ I'm crazy with excitement ♪ - No. Stop it, Mr. Molesley. ♪ Completely off the rails. ♪ All of my suppliers are so excited. Oh, Mrs. Patmore, I shall never be able to thank you enough, not if I live to be 100. I feel like a liar. I should go back. And lower yourself to a kitchen skivvy in the eyes of the village? Never mind ruining Mr. Bakewell's year. You'll do no such thing. No maid. No valet. No nanny, even. It's 1927. We're modern folk. Nanny will take care of Marigold. And Anna can look after you. Really? Can she? Of course. Just like the old days. Granny's here, and Isobel, and we're paying a call this afternoon on Princess Mary. Oh. Has my new ball dress arrived? Not yet, but it will. Hello, Mary. How are you? How long have you worked for Her Majesty, Miss Lawton? - Six years. - How interesting. I expect you're a skilled needlewoman for that job. Well, I've had no complaints. I trained under Madame Lucile. Her Majesty wanted a professional dressmaker. And they found you? My reputation found me. Oh. Come on, you two. It's nearly 3:00. We ought to get ready. - Will the princess be at the parade? - Thank you. - They both will. - What time are they expecting us? I always find her rather sad, Princess Mary. Well, she is royal. Royal women are not meant to grin like Cheshire cats. Well, they don't have to look miserable. Well, to you, she looks miserable. To me, she looks dignified. Doesn't that say it all? How comforting to see you here, Carson. What prompted you to take up the flaming sword again? I felt I should go where I could do the most good, milady. Wise words for all of us. Her Royal Highness is here. The Marchioness of Hexham, the Countess of Grantham, the Lady Mary Talbot. Your Royal Highness. Please, sit down, Lady Grantham. I suppose you're in turmoil because of my parents' visit. I do sympathize. We don't need to explain it to you. Just don't paint anything. They're sick of the smell of new paint. I hope it's not too late. Are you living here now, ma'am? No. No, we're still at Goldsborough. But Lord Harewood's not well, so... we've come to run the visit and the ball. Oh, hello. Hello, my darlings. How have you been? Have you been having a lovely day? Hmm? Yes? This is your lucky day. I'm the new plumber, Tony Sellick. Oh, yes. Right. Well, I'd better show you where the boiler is. Where are you off to? This is Mr. Sellick, the plumber. I'm taking him to the boiler house. - I'll do it. - No, you're all right. Just tell Mrs. Patmore where I am. Please bring the boys on Thursday. Oh, how lovely. Why are the children in here? We just got back, and they wanted to... They're not allowed in the drawing room before 6:00. - I know, milord. But they... - Take them upstairs. And don't bring them down again tonight. - Yes, milord. - But they were only... Thank you, Nanny. - Please, Nanny? - No, we're going. You remember Lady Grantham and her daughters? Lady Grantham. They want us to bring the boys to the parade. No. They'd only cause a ruckus. We were hoping you would both stay for dinner that night, Lord Lascelles. No, I'm afraid not. Well... I'll leave you to it. Well, I suppose I better let you get started, - so I'll be on me way. - Aren't you gonna wish me luck? You don't look as if you need me to wish you luck, Mr. Sellick. Or anyone else, for that matter. You don't know what I need. And I don't intend to find out. Do we need to cut the grass again? They're doing it tomorrow morning. Hello, Mr. Branson. Ah. Getting ready for Their Majesties, I see. - That's right. This is Lord Hexham. - Ah. May I present Major Chetwode. - Are you here for the parade? - I am. I'm staying at the pub. - Milord? - Excuse me. Or are you here to keep an eye on me? I was rather hoping you'd be my guide for the ceremony. Would you like a drink? I'll join you in a minute. Well, well done. - Who's he? - I don't really know. Army, perhaps. Or maybe a civil servant. But I'll drink with him and try and put his mind at rest. What does he want? Maybe to make sure I'm a leopard who has changed his spots. What about you, milady? - Is everything ready? - No. And my heart is pounding. By the way, have you seen the silver box from the table by the fire in the drawing room? My grandmother used to keep playing cards in it. I know the one. - Is it missing? - Yes. And so is the little cupid from the mantelshelf. Oh, they must have been taken downstairs for cleaning. I was just coming to you, milady. Oh, don't worry. I'm fine. - If that's all, milady? - I suppose. Can you manage the jug and basin? Or are they too heavy? No, no, I can do it. Oh, how's the boiler? I'm sure they'll fix it soon. Bertie was with Tom earlier. You don't think Tom would ever try to make trouble? Why do you say that? Well, Bertie says there's some army type who has him under surveillance. Tom likes to shock, that's all. He'd never be disloyal to this family. Never. Shall we go down? Yes, let's. So, I said to her, "Listen, lady, there's a little one here - who still needs turning." - Oh! Careful. Mr. Sellick, you'll make Daisy blush. Takes more than that to make me blush. - Now, get that down you. - You deserve that. - It's very late. - Well, I've got to get it done. And I don't mind long hours. I, uh, mean to build me own business, and you can't do that working 9:00 to 5:00. These water jugs nearly killed me. How did we manage in the old days? Well, maybe people were tougher then. Maybe they expected less from life. Well, I expect a lot from life. So do I. And I mean to have it, too. Are you still here? Mr. Sellick's been working hard for hours for our benefit, Andy. Then it's time he went home. Is the savory ready? Take this. Mmm. He's right. The new pump should arrive around 9:00. - I'll be here. - So will we. Ta-ra. That was Mama. She's in London. - She's staying with Rosamund. - She can't be. She was here for lunch. She didn't say anything. She went up this afternoon. She'll be back tomorrow, so I've asked her to come for tea. You must persuade her to leave Maud Bagshaw alone. I don't believe even Mama will pick a quarrel in front of the king. I wonder if he can come early. Are you excited? I am a bit. Are you? Would it be common to admit it? Not to an American. Here we go, Mr. Carson. Leave this to me. I am Monsieur Courbet. And this is Mrs. Webb, the housekeeper. Ah. Follow that path, and it'll take you into the kitchen courtyard. I said, I am Monsieur Courbet, chef to Their Majesties. Well done, Charlie. Always start as you mean to go on. This way, gentlemen. - Miss Lawton? - I was just looking round. It's a beautiful house. You've seen many that are finer. That's what I came for. But we shouldn't be in here, really. Prepare for your battle with the barbarians. Oh! You. Uh, where can I put this? Don't tempt me. We've cleared some space in the scullery. And that cupboard. What a lot of fuss over nothing. Well, where's our order from Mr. Bakewell? Follow me. Well, how did you manage it? A gardener helped me carry everything in, so no one saw. I suppose you could sell the lot and use the money to pay Mr. Bakewell. Don't worry. They can eat it gradual when the visit's over. Ah! It's done, Mrs. Patmore. The new pump's installed. Hail the conquering hero. It's Mrs. Hughes you should be telling. Or Mr. Carson. Not them. It's all right, Mr. Sellick. We'll see the news gets through. Thanks. I would not feed it to my dog! But I don't need your help, Mrs. Hughes. I just want to know where Their Majesties are sleeping so Miss Stinson can prepare the rooms. Then I will show you, Mrs. Webb, because, without my help, you will not find them. Is it always like this? A royal visit is like a swan on a lake. Grace and serenity above, demented kicking down below. I wish I could get away. I've got tomorrow night off when Mr. Miller arrives. Told my mum I'd look in. Why don't you come to York with me? - We could have a drink. - You should go. - You're not on duty. - That settles it, then. I'll come find you when I'm released. We can borrow a car. Mrs. Webb, I am the housekeeper here. You are not housekeeper so long as His Majesty is under this roof. Yes, but he's not here yet, is he? It's like living in a factory. It reminds me of our days as a convalescent home during the war. I enjoyed that, although I always feel guilty saying so. Where's Tom? - Daddy's in the village. - Again? - What's he playing at? - Oh, I saw Tom looking very stern as I came up the drive. I hope he's not building a bomb. Many a true word is spoken in jest. We think he's being tailed by Special Branch. Nonsense. - Mama, how was London? - Oh, fine. Fine. What were you there for? - Oh, various things. - But you hate London. Whoever told you that? Now, when do you want me tomorrow? 12:00 at the latest. They arrive at half past. But, Mama, you must promise not to attack Maud Bagshaw. Well, I can't ignore her. - She is my cousin. - Exactly. Greet her as a cousin, and leave it at that. - I'll think about it. - But even if she has left everything to an outsider, what could we do? Challenge the will. On what basis? Undue influence. But how could you know that? And how would you prove it? We'd find a friendly judge. Friendly or corrupt? Whichever does the trick. Are you here for dinner, Mama? It's a buffet. - Well, I'm not changed. - We won't change, either, so you just need to take off your hat. You talk as if that were easy. Where's the paper knife, the silver one with my regimental crest? They won't help tonight, apparently. They won't lift a finger. But then, my food is only fit for servants. Well, at least your young hero seems to have sorted out the water. He's not my hero. Yes. Why did you call him that? Oh, it was just a joke. - But why's it funny? - Oh, Andy, leave it. - But this is a rabbit hutch. - Don't look at me, Mr. Courbet. You couldn't swing a cat in my room. Gentlemen, please. I'm sure you'll find... Out of my way. I will have a bath, and then I will decide. Perhaps I will find a hotel. Where can we eat? Somewhere apart? Uh, why not in the servants' hall? We never eat with the resident staff. - Excuse me. - The water's cold. What's happening? Th-This is impossible. We can't stay here with no hot water. - Are you crazy? - But the boiler was fixed today. It was hot an hour ago. Well, it's cold now. Why are you here again, Mr. Carson? So you could keep control when I would fail? Was that it? I-I forget. You... Mr. Barrow, would you mind? I'm not on duty, Mr. Carson. You are. Sorry, sir. What do you want? Since you are in my room, sitting at my desk, it is for me to ask what you want. Nothing from you. I would remind you that I have been in charge of Downton for many years. Mr. Carson, you are a retired servant in a minor provincial house, serving an undistinguished family. Your history is of no interest to me. Now, if you will excuse me. So, what would you like me to do? I would like you to find a good book and read it until we leave. Mr. Carson, you'd better come and see this. It's well and truly damaged. - Can you mend it in time? - Oh, yeah. But somebody should tell them someone wanted to wreck the royal visit. They ought to know. - Has the dress arrived? - Not yet. - What am I going to wear? - Carson, what is it? Uh, some folding chairs... well, a great many chairs have been delivered, milady. They're at the back door. Anna thought you should be told at once. She's right. They're for the parade, and we'll have to set them out tonight. There'll be no time tomorrow. The villagers will start arriving from 9:00 onwards. I'm not sure fate is on our side. Poor little Mary. Have we let her take on too much? Yes, you're right. Come on. We should lend her a hand. Well, you can't go out in this. Of course we can. Good night, Mama. Remember to pray for us, mainly for better weather. I'll put in a word. Of course, little Mary could hammer in a tent peg with her teeth. I wonder who she got that from. You know, I'm always surprised when you praise me. I'm surprised to hear that I have. As if things aren't bad enough without a thunderstorm. We'll manage. I've roped in Mr. Molesley, and Andy's gone for the truck. But, well, Mr. Bates can't help. And Mr. Barrow has vanished. Ditto. Lord Hexham's out looking for Mr. Branson. We'll have to do our best without them. You're not going yourself? Well, how else will they know what to do? Then I'll fetch our coats. Well, you don't have to come. Of course I do. I'll just tell Mr. Bates where I've gone. You're a good friend to me, Anna. I hope we're good friends to each other, milady. - This should be the last of them. - Great. Okay, give me that, Mr. Molesley. - Can you chuck us the rope? - Here you go. - Tie it down, make sure it's tight. - Here we are. - All set and ready. - Oh, Papa, Dickie, you're so kind. But are you sure? You'll be soaked to the skin and filthy. Well, what's that to us? We're hunting men. - Come on. - You don't need to come, my dear. We can manage it between us. Of course I'm coming. Come along. Cheer up, Molesley. The villagers and guests will watch from both sides of the dais. And there'll be seats at the front kept for the family. - I'll join you there. - I suppose so. We'll meet in the high street where we planned. Don't bring anyone. Come on your own. It's all ridiculous, of course. It's a lot of fuss over nothing. What? I thought you were here to check I didn't do anything foolish and spoil things. - In what way? - I don't know. Throw eggs or wave a banner or shout. Will you? No. But I'm starting to wonder about you. I don't throw eggs. - Have another? - Yes. - Same again, please. - Right you are, sir. We'll bring a special chair up for the queen after breakfast when, hopefully, it will have stopped raining. I shall carry it myself, milord. - Well, what about the king? - Well, he'll be on his horse. But suppose it's still raining? God will make it stop. Is that Tom? Has he been in the pub the whole evening? Well, the day has dawned, and the weather proves conclusively that God is a monarchist. Who could doubt it, milady? Here they come now. Mr. Molesley? I'm all right. Just need a minute to catch my breath. Your Majesties, welcome to Downton Abbey. We're glad to be here, Lady Grantham. Grantham. You remember Lord Grantham's mother. - Hello, Lady Grantham. - Oh. Oh, can I help you? Someone must, sir, or I... I may never rise again. Thank you. - My daughter, Lady Mary Talbot. - Hmm. The Marquess and Marchioness of Hexham. Mr. Tom Branson. Lord and Lady Merton. This is kind of you, - Lord Grantham. - Oh, not at all. It is a great honor. I'm sure you know, but Princess Mary and Lord Lascelles will be joining us for luncheon and the parade. They're both coming? As far as I'm aware. What a relief. Please forget I said that. Said what, ma'am? - Cousin Maud. - Violet. Are we going to kiss? I'm glad you want to kiss me. It wasn't quite what you said when I last heard from you. Wasn't quite how I felt when I wrote. Can I help you at all? Thanks. The others all shot off, and I'm not sure if this is the right way. Just come with me. What's your part in this circus? I'm Lady Bagshaw's maid. Oh, well, then it's this door. You just ask for Mrs. Hughes. - She'll look after you. - Thank you. Oh, have you tasted the water? Only for body. Never for drinking. Ah, this has just arrived for Lady Edith. Lady Hexham these days, Mr. Bates, but... Thank you, Albert. It's a relief. I want the milk now. I want the egg yolks now. I want the olive oil now. And I want the vanilla pod now. He wants a clip around the ear... now. Careful, Mrs. Patmore. Uh, right. Who's taking this up? Mr. Molesley? Uh, there's no need for you to meddle, Mrs. Hughes. - We will see to it. - Meddle? I don't believe I'm meddling in my own house, thank you. Andrew, yes. - You take that one. - But it's not your house, is it? So, would you like to go and sit down? - Now, just a minute. - Uh, you leave those. Put them down. For heaven's sake, go after them. I really must protest. My staff are... Keep them down here, Mr. Carson. That goes for you, too. Stay out of our way. You've seen Their Majesties. Let it be enough. - Excuse me. - Wait a minute. What-what are you playing at? Hang on. What...? Things seem calmer in the north. You mean after the strike, sir? Yes, if calmer means more resigned. I'm not sure what the future holds. Hmm. And you, Lady Grantham. Were you affected by the general strike? Well, my maid was rather curt with me while it was on, sir. But, you know, she is a communist at heart. So I suppose it was only to be expected. Wasn't the princess joining us? Uh, they telephoned. Lord Lacelles has been held up by something. Uh, but they are planning to come for the parade. I imagine the servants' bedrooms are quite pleasant here. Why? Are you worried for your maid? How clever of you. Lucy is more of a companion than a maid. I'd hate for her to be uncomfortable. Of course. I really have to go. You can't embarrass Mama. I'm sorry, but you must wait until we stand. Lord Hexham, how is Northumberland? As beautiful as ever, sir. Can it spare you, do you think? Well, that was humiliating. Go on. Oh! Well, we might as well all go for a walk. We cannot challenge the way a royal visit is conducted, Mrs. Patmore. - I'm not so sure. - Why don't we all meet - back here after the parade? - Anna, Mr. Bates, there must be no trouble or disloyal tomfoolery of any kind. Do you hear me? We'll meet in the wine cellar. Tell the others. Now, I'm walking to Mr. Bakewell's, - if you've any errands. - No. Well, then, - we should get moving. - Ah. - Of course, sir. - Yes. - Here we go. Ma'am. I'm so looking forward to this. - Okay. - Good lunch, I thought. What was the king saying earlier? I couldn't hear. He's planning a tour for the Prince of Wales next March. It'll take in most of the African colonies - and finish in Cape Town. - And he wants you to go? He thinks I'm a steadying influence. How long would you be away? About three months. I can't believe my luck. Can you? I think we're parked around the back. Tom. What on earth are you doing here? I might ask you the same question. Go back, or you'll ruin things. Isn't that what you're doing? You don't know what I'm doing. - Who's this? - This is my sister-in-law, Lady Mary Talbot. I told you to come alone. Leave this to me. - Tom! - Get the gun! There he is. - Hold still. - Got him? Calm down. You're not going anywhere. - Hold still. - Are you all right, sir? - High treason, that is. - Your Ladyship? Why are you even here? I didn't suspect him myself until last night. How was I to know you'd given up on a free Ireland? Isn't it free now? Not with the bloody Crown around its neck! Get in. - Take him away. - All right, sir. I'm not impressed you all decided I was a royal assassin. I didn't. It was really the others. If you'll follow us to the station. Why didn't you tell us? I thought he'd come to check up on me and didn't want to drag you into it. I assumed he'd back off if I answered his questions and met him for a drink. But last night at the pub, I realized he wanted to use me to get close to the king. Royal salute! Carry... swords! Sorry. Excuse me. We thought you'd miss it. I was just in time. I don't know why I bothered. - Shh! - Oh, quiet. Your Majesty, the Yorkshire Hussars are formed up, ready and awaiting your inspection. Where is he? He's not feeling well. Wasn't he out shooting yesterday? - What do you want me to say? - Nothing. You have to let me leave him. We will not talk about it now. Is that your maid? That's right. Lucy. Don't you call her by her surname? She's been with me so long. It's so strange. - He seemed so English. - And so he was. A pillar of the establishment, until the notion of Irish independence took him over to the other side. That's where I came in. He'd heard my sympathies lay with Ireland and the republic. Don't they? Not at any cost. I'm a law-and-order man these days. That's what you lot have done to me. So, will there be a great splash all over the newspapers? Poor Papa. Oh, no. You'll find there isn't a whisper about this anywhere. An establishment cover-up. I don't believe in conspiracy theories. Yes. - Do you... do you write? - I try. Ah, Miss Smith. Did Mrs. Hughes sort you out? She did. And have you enjoyed the parade? Do you work at the house? Not exactly. I sell cars, and I help with the estate. Lord Grantham is my father-in-law. Oh, I do beg your pardon, sir. Oh, no, please, let me explain. I started here as a chauffeur. You must be Lady Sybil's husband. I am. Lady Bagshaw and I followed the story. We were so sad when she died. How long ago was it? Seven years, or nearly. - My God. - I'm sorry. - It's still painful. - Not in that way. It doesn't hurt anymore, but it's still there. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. Was it hard, coming up like that? Joining the family. Very hard. Between my old world and the new one, sometimes I didn't know who I was. But you do now? I think so, yes. I came to terms with it. Why? I'm just curious. Quickly, everyone. Quick. Come on. Quickly, Mr. Barrow. Can somebody tell me what's going on? Anna? - Shh! - What's going on? What are we all doing down here? Shh. Go inside. They can't hear us in there. This is most improper. Yes, why-why have you got us all here? - Yeah. - I will tell you. Mr. Bates and I... we want to defend Downton's honor. In what way? Would you like a repeat of how you were all treated at luncheon? No, I bloody well would not. Andrew, there are ladies present. We think we should fight back. I don't like the sound of this. I do not like this at all. Anna, tell them. We are going to clear the way so you cook and serve dinner for the king and queen at Downton Abbey. As you should. Well, oh, my God, is this a revolution? Shall I fetch the pitchforks? No, we're serious, Mr. Moseley. But do you know what Mr. Courbet's brought in for tonight? Mm, never mind that. We've got our own supplies. And you can leave Mr. Courbet to me. What do you want us to do? Don't bother with the maids and valets. We've no quarrel with them. But we need to get rid of the royal butler - for the night. - The Page of the Backstairs, if you don't mind, Mr. Bates. And the footmen need to be out of commission from 7:00 until you finish serving them. This is treason. Well, what can we do about 'em? Well, we could lock them in the attic. Any more talk like that, and we'll all end up in Botany Bay. And did you enjoy being pushed around and passed over and told to stay down here by Mr. Wilson? I will play no active part in this. Well, suppose His Majesty sees what's going on and is displeased. Why? Do you think I'm not capable of cooking a decent dinner? Oh, no, of course not. But-but I... I'll see to the footmen. What are you going to do? You'll find out. So, does this mean we're back on duty after all? - Me and Mr. Moseley? - And Albert as well. You know where to find the state liveries. Right. - Well, come on, Daisy. - Will I pour wine for the queen's sweet lips? Any more of that, and we'll lock you in the attic. I don't know why you're bothering. What about that Mrs. Webb who keeps telling us she's the housekeeper? Don't you worry about Mrs. Webb. I am more than a match for Mrs. Webb. I still don't know how you're going to manage Mr. Courbet. Well, there's, um... I'm just going upstairs to lie down. Can you get things ready for when I come back? When will that be, O Mighty One? Wake me in half an hour if I'm not already in the kitchen. Trust us. Tell us about your maid. Lucy is the daughter of... David's army servant, Jack Smith. And, like my husband, he died in the Boer Wars. So you looked after his child? Lucy had no mother, you see. So I gave her a home. That's very generous. Generosity that has been amply returned, I can assure you. I'm glad. You don't sound very glad. Oh, goodness. I thought everyone was in the drawing room. I've been dodging it, I'm afraid. I suppose I ought to get back. Can I get someone for you? No, thank you. You're the widower of the youngest daughter, aren't you? I've heard of you, Mister... Branson. Tom Branson. And who are you? Ah, I should know, but I'm no good at that sort of thing. Well, I suppose you can't be expected to know everyone. Mm. Did you enjoy the parade? I'm afraid I missed it completely. I got distracted. - What a shame. - Well, to be honest, I'm not much of a royalist. Although I probably shouldn't say that out loud. Certainly not to a stranger. That seems odd, as the Crawleys would die for the Crown if they had to. You can love people you disagree with. And you love them? They're decent at the core. People can be decent at the core but very difficult to live with. True enough. And they're silly, too, and snobbish at times. And I wouldn't give tuppence for their politics. But I've learned to be happy with all of that. And besides... they're my daughter's family. And she lives here? I nearly took her away once. But she belongs here now. I spent so much of my life not belonging anywhere. That's important to me. I suppose, in the end, it's deciding what's important, isn't it? You've given me a great deal to think about, Mr. Branson. Good things, I hope. That may be so, but... now we must go in. We must change. And you leave in the morning. I wonder if we might have a talk later. We'll find a cozy spot. And Robert can join us. I won't be interrogated, Violet. Please, don't miss the chance to settle things between you. Very well. But now I must go. That was helpful. Thank you. Well, I told you I wanted to help. Well, thanks to you, we have her cornered. Mr. Wilson. There's a telephone call for you. For me? But, Sir Harry, they wouldn't get to London until 9:00. It doesn't matter. The ball at Clarence House won't start till 10:00. What ball at Clarence House? The Duke of Connaught's. What are you playing at, Wilson? I'm not questioning you, sir, not if it's what the Duke of Connaught wishes. But how do I manage here? Don't they have footmen at Downton? Yes, there are footmen. But won't His Majesty... His Majesty won't give a tinker's cuss! - Now, do as I say. - Of course, Sir Harry. At once. Everything all right, Mr. Wilson? I need to see my footmen and the house footmen and the hall boy. Uh, when is the next train to London? I hope it's not bad news. Not bad, exactly. But irregular. Very irregular, indeed. I'll get drummed out of the regiment if they ever find out. Well, you sounded convincing to me. Oh, I'm very good at doing Sir Harry Barnston, - I can assure you. - What if Mr. Wilson rings back? No one queries Sir Harry's orders. But if he did? Well, then they'd uncover the trick. But they couldn't trace it back to me. Right. Shall we go into York? Sorry to miss out on the fun, in a way. Where shall I wait for you when you're with your parents? We'll find a pub. Did you manage to speak to someone? I got hold of Madame Seymour's assistant. They've sent you the wrong one. It's similar in style but not, as you can see, - in size. - Well, where's my dress now? On its way to New York. Well, that's that, then. Wonderful. Everything's going wrong for me today. - Milady? - Oh. Never mind. How are things downstairs? Any better? A bit better, yes, milady. In fact, I ought to be getting back. Of course. Oh, one thing. The painted glass that used to sit by my bed, was it broken while I was away? Leave it with me, milady. And the dress. You wouldn't mind a fitting later tonight, would you? I don't understand. Who with? I just had an idea. I shouldn't think so, not if she knows what's good for her. Oh, I... I'm sorry to interrupt. How clever of you to find me. Well, not really. I lived here 40 years. I assume this is your maid? - Yes, this is Lucy Smith. - Oh. Good evening, Smith. Good evening, milady. - Shall I go? - No, not for me. Not for me. I'm delighted to meet you. I've heard so much about you. Is there something you want? Hmm? Oh, just-just to see you're comfortable and to confirm our little chat for later. I live my own life now, Violet. I'm not what I was. My father is gone. My husband is gone. I see no reason not to do what I want. Well, that doesn't mean there is no reason, merely that you cannot see it. I think Lady Merton is right. We'll have it out, once and for all. But now I must go to Her Majesty. Hmm. You're not to speak. You're not to think. Just follow my lead. Their Majesties must not know they're being served by anyone different. Do you hear me? I don't want them to even notice. We will do our best, Mr. Wilson. I don't want your best. I want far better than your best. Is everything under control here, Mr. Wilson? I gather the others caught the train. And this is what we're left with. Mind you don't disgrace the state livery, Albert. Of course, Mr. Carson. Where is Monsieur Courbet? - I came in here to see him. - Uh, he went out. So I thought I'd better get on with dinner. Wasn't I right? - No, you were not right. You were entirely wrong! - Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know h-how that happened. Well, I shall have to go and change. We'll sort this out when I return. Andy. If you don't want me to, I won't. But you've already said that you will. Because it's a fantastic chance. It didn't occur to me you'd mind. I don't, exactly. Not in that way. Then in what way? I wasn't going to tell you. I wasn't going to tell anyone, but... I might be pregnant. Oh, darling. How marvelous. How fabulous. My heart is bursting. Oh, well, that's exactly what I don't want. - It could easily go wrong. - Oh, but-but if it doesn't... Then I'll give birth just as you set off on your three-month colonial tour. Why didn't you say this when I first mentioned it? You'd agreed before I had the chance. Secrets always muddle things. Oh, yes, that's right, let's make it my fault. Well, I'll tell the king I can't go. And he'll accept that, will he? Hello. It's Miss Smith, isn't it? We were talking about you earlier. Weren't we? Oh, Tom. What luck. You know Miss Smith, don't you? Come along, Mary. Are you all right? Has something happened? Old Lady Grantham came in while we were dressing. I think the stage is set for a fight later, about me. She thinks Lady Bagshaw means to favor me, - and she doesn't approve. - What business is it of hers? Lady Bagshaw must have her reasons, and that's good enough for me. Going down, Tom? Good night. Ah, there you are, Miss Lawton. I hope you're having a well-earned rest. Well, there's always less for me to do when Miss Aplin arrives. But we must be ready for the ball tomorrow. That's what I want to talk about. Later this evening, when I go up to help Lady Hexham, I want you to come with me, fit a new ball dress and sew it overnight so it's done before you leave in the morning. Why on earth would I do that? The box and cupid from the drawing room. The library paper knife. Lady Hexham's painted glass. Never took the glass. Then it must have been broken, like she said. But you took something from that room. What was it? A patch box from the dressing table. I'd like them all back, please. I can't sew a dress in a night. When would I sleep? When you get to Harewood tomorrow. And don't think I won't tell. "Queen's dresser a thief." That'll make headlines from here to Peru. The Marquess and Marchioness of Granby. Sir William and Lady Ingleby. Where are the royal footmen? They've had to go back to London. All of them? Wasn't that rather unlucky? Unlucky for some, milady. The Earl and Countess of Scarborough. Ah. For goodness' sake! Help me! Will someone help me? I'm going on to Turton's in a minute. Do you know it? Uh... I'm Chris Webster, by the way. I'm waiting for someone. For a very long time. Perhaps he's found better things to do. And? Why don't you come with me? You know you want to. Excuse me, sir. My name's Barrow. If someone comes looking for me, could you tell him I've gone? - Shall I say where to? - Never mind that. - Turton's. I just cannot understand where Mr. Wilson has got to. Never mind him. What about you? Surely, you can't really mean to leave His Majesty unattended. But is it for me to attend him? Well, you've got your breeches on. - Well, I have, but... - Mr. Carson, this is your destiny. You know as much, and so do I. Now, accept it proudly. And walk into that room with your head held high. You can do it, Mr. Carson. Please tell me what is going on. Mr. Courbet is missing, ditto Mr. Wilson, and your footmen are on their way up to London. I am still in charge here. No, Mrs. Webb. These are my people now. So please, uh, go back to the servants' hall and sit down. Or would you rather ruin the evening? That's telling her. Mrs. Patmore forgot to send up the sauce. - And I've got the chopped egg. - Oh, that's kind - when it's not your job. - Nonsense. We must all pull our weight tonight for Downton's glory. Now, are you ready, boys? Ready as we'll ever be. We'll be fine, Mrs. Hughes. What about you, Mr. Molesley? I know I'm gonna forget my lines. You haven't got any lines. - You're on. - Oh. Right. And, Mr. Molesley? Remember to breathe. Breathe, yeah. Gentlemen. I'm glad you're here, Mr. Carson. I must go where my king needs me. - Hello. - All right. Oh, hello. Looks like we've got some new blood here. Hello. You're a very charming young man. Hey! Stay with me! Stay with me, Michael! I can't believe this. I've never seen anything like it. There's a first time for everything. I know, but... Here. Come dance with me. - What'd you say? - I said, "There's your friend." No, my friend's over there. I wish I could tell them how grateful they should be to you. You were every bit as brave as I was. Mary, you're talking in the wrong direction. Don't worry about Granny. She's getting ready to give Cousin Maud a grilling. Mainly, I suspect, about her maid. I think Lady Bagshaw sees her as more than just her maid. Oh, I'm sure she does. And that's what Granny's afraid of. I might as well admit... I like her. Good. Don't let them put you off. Tom, you're looking pleased with yourself. He was just praising Lady Bagshaw's maid. Well, uh, how did she contrive to make your acquaintance? She didn't contrive anything. We met by chance. What simpletons men are. This is good. And I thought something else was planned. But it is excellent. So, a well-done to old Courbet. - Oh, yes. - Yes, very delicious. This wasn't Monsieur Courbet, Your Majesty. Mrs. Patmore cooked it. In fact, it is the Downton Abbey staff who are serving you this evening. Oh. Oh. I do beg your pardon, Your Majesty. That's quite enough, Molesley. You must give our compliments to Mrs. Patmore and all the staff. - Molesley. - Huh? Her Majesty is speaking to you. With pleasure, Your Majesty. That was kind of you, ma'am. I suppose he's excited that they've had to take over from our people. I wonder what's happened. Whatever may have happened does not excuse his behavior. I can assure you, Lady Grantham, we are quite used to people behaving strangely when we are near. - Whoa! - That's it. I've got you. The peelers are here! It's the police! Make sure no one scarpers. Block all the exits. - What's going on? - All right, gentlemen, that's the end of your evening. Shut that music up now! Right! You are all coming to the station with us. We're just having a bit of fun, Officer. No one's making any trouble. That's for the judge to decide. - Judge? - What did you think? We're gonna slap your wrists and send you home? I've never been here before. You're here now. Right! Gather your things! You're coming with us, you dirty perverts. Out. - Get out! Move it! - Come on, you filthy sods. - Come on, you lot. - Pack it in. Get in the van. Sort it out. - There we are, my dear. - Oh, thank you. Yes, darling. Thank you. There might be a moment. I met the maid. She has Maud wound around her little finger. - Then we need to know why. - Mm. Well, I'll look forward to it, gentlemen. - Thank you, Your Majesty. - Milord. What is it, Hexham? Well, Your Majesty, it's this. I've just learned that Lady Hexham is expecting our first child. But that's wonderful news. We're not telling anyone quite yet, but I thought you'd be interested. And so I am. Congratulations. The-the thing is, sir, it's due to be born around the time the prince and I will be setting off on tour. Excellent. Please make it register with him. Help the prince to understand what it means to have a real family life. You can be such an example to him. I know it. Very well. Let's get to the point. Robert is my nearest relation on my father's side. He is. But he will not be my heir. And there we have it. Who will be? Can you tell us? Lucy Smith, my maid. What? Are you out of your mind? No. And I know what I'm doing. On the contrary, you're-you're clearly insane. You should be in an asylum. How like you. A word of resistance, and you slash with your saber. It is lucky for Miss Smith that I do not own a saber. So, this is truly your choice? Lucy has taken care of me for many years. I wish to show my gratitude. With the family house? With the family estate? You belong in a straitjacket. To treat your maid as a blood relation is to unpick every fiber of the English way of life. What piffle you talk. - Oh! - Please, there is no need to argue. I never argue. I explain. Face it, Violet, I'll outlive you anyway, so it need trouble you no further. And now... I must attend Her Majesty. Game, set and match to Lady Bagshaw. Not while I'm the umpire. We had a few drinks, and Mr. Barrow thought it'd be fun to play a trick on the queers, that's all. He was only in there for five minutes. Dancing the tango with another man. Come on, Sergeant, it was a joke. Turns your stomach, though. - Relieved to hear it. - Yeah, I'd rather be dead if I thought I was one of them. But what can I say to the earl? What earl? The Earl of Grantham. Mr. Barrow is his butler. Of course, you'll want to see proof of my identity. - Was it you who got me out? - No. The good fairy came down on a moonbeam. How did you know where I'd gone? The landlord told me. Waited outside, followed you here. Then I showed the sergeant my card, and that seemed to settle things. "The royal household." He must have loved that. I'm a... I'm afraid I've been a silly boy. You just need to be a bit more circumspect in future, Mr. Barrow. Could you please remove it, milady, leaving the pins in place? Can you really get it done before you go? - I don't see how. - She'll finish it. - Won't you? - I'll do my best. I'm sure you'll manage. By the way, I think I know what happened to the cupid from the drawing room, milady. Really? Was it missing? Your dress will be ready in the morning, milady. Thank you. I don't know how you persuaded her. She's nice, really. When you get to know her. Is there anything else? Only to say that you're a genius. - Good night. - Good night. I'm afraid I didn't get anywhere. Well, that's that. Just because the king doesn't see that a man has any part to play in childbearing. Well, he doesn't. But you'd think he'd know that one likes to be around. You can't just tell him no? Darling, I'm one of the senior peers in the land. What do you think that means? What do you think I'm sworn to? Lady Bagshaw, could I have a word before you ring for your maid? Does Lucy know that you're her mother? She does. For years, I said I was her godmother, but I told her the truth on her 18th birthday. How old was she when Jack died? Six. She'd lived with Jack and his mother until then. But I took her into the house, and she went to the village school until, eventually, she became my maid. I suppose if she'd been your ward, people would have guessed. Exactly. Who takes notice of a servant? I hid her in plain sight. Did you love Jack Smith? Everyone should know a total love at least once. Jack was mine. My husband was very dull, you know? He wasn't a bad man, but... but he wasn't a clever one, either. Then he died, and Jack came to see me, and it began from there. How daring. I know it sounds reckless, but I was 39 when I got pregnant. I thought I was barren. Of course, I knew I couldn't tell my father, so... I went to America. They must have thought that wild. Well, little did they know how wild it really was. But you were happy with Jack? Oh, very. We had ten years together before he died. I'd have married him if I'd had the courage. I was weak. But you never knew my father. I suppose royal service kept you silent on the subject. Yes. In a way. But it was cowardice, really. Now, by making Lucy my heir, I will have taken the first step. You must tell Violet at once. - I couldn't. - You're wrong. As soon as she knows the truth, she'll fathom your plans and cease to fight you. The servants seem to be enjoying themselves tonight. Especially Molesley. What happened to the royal team? It's a long story, milady. But you're right. We did have fun. Well, I'm glad it's gone well for everyone. But I don't think I could face doing it again. You're not finished yet. You've still got the ball at Harewood. Yes, but it won't be our fault if anything goes wrong. That's not very cheerful. The last few days have made me think. Should we really go on with it? We're running the house with too few people as it is, and half of those here now will leave soon. What are you saying, milady? Isn't it time to chuck in the towel? Lots of people have. You mean... leave Downton? We could sell it for a school or an old people's home or something. And buy a manor house with a modest estate and live a normal life. Is that what you want? I want everything to stop being such a struggle. Will the staff stay? Will the farms pay? What are we going to do about the roof? When I was putting up the chairs in the rain, I kept thinking, "What am I doing?" I'll tell you what you're doing, milady. You're making a center for the people who work here. For this village. For the county. Downton Abbey is the heart of this community, and you're keeping it beating. So you think we should battle on? - While there's blood in your veins. - Hmm. Ah, Miss Smith. Is she settled for the night? She's more rattled than settled. And I was right. There was an argument. It was about me. I hear from Lord Grantham she's planning to alter your life for the better. He says Old Lady Grantham was up in arms. I can imagine. Are you entitled to your good luck? Do you know why she's doing it? I do. And I think it's fair. Go forward in health, and use your luck wisely. I have such a feeling that you can understand what's going on inside my head when no one else does or ever could. I'll miss our talks. Would you like to write to me? I could always provide a shoulder. May I? Really? I should be pleased and flattered if you would. And now I think it's time to say good night, Mr. Branson. Good night, Miss Smith. Here's to the triumph of Downton and my beautiful wife. Oh, here's to all of you who brought it off. Here's to Mr. Carson for swallowing his principles. Well, I shan't sleep a wink tonight. And here's to Her Majesty for taking pity on Mr. Molesley. For a moment there, I thought I was headed for the Tower. You're not coming round to 'em, are you? Uh, it was decent of her, Daisy, when she could have let it spoil things. Not everyone's like Robespierre. Let's hear it for the king and queen. The king and queen. I've got to tell you something, Daisy. It was me that broke the pump. I don't know what I was doing. I was just in a jealous rage. - Why? - It was that plumber you made eyes at. I just saw red. And then when I realized I'd brought him back to the house, I went nearly mad. I did not make eyes. I liked him, but there was nothing more to it. Well, I feel a fool now. You tried to wreck the visit of the King of England. You risked being sacked, you risked ruin... ...just for the love of me? I just... my feelings took over. That's all I can say. Can you forgive me? Forgive you? Oh, Andy, I'd have done it myself if I'd had the nerve. Don't you see what it means? We're alike, you and I. Full of passion for what matters. I thought you were easily satisfied, but I see now you're not. So we can fight our way to a better world together. I'm not sure I've shown enough gratitude for what you did. We have to stick together, men like us. That's the point. I don't know any men like I am. I've never just talked to someone like me. Well, we're talking now. And it feels good. Just to be two blokes, having a chat, not trying to fit in for once. Well, we all have to do what we must to get by. But yeah. Feels good to be two ordinary blokes. Will they ever see it our way? I don't know. 50 years ago, who'd have thought man could fly? Mrs. Bates? Well, here's the dress. We can try it before you leave. No need. It'll fit. Those are the things you wanted. Why do you do it, Miss Lawton? Doesn't it ever worry you that on each table in this house, there's an ornament that you couldn't buy with a year's wages? And what's your answer? Because everyone can't have them, - no one should have them? - No. My answer is, "Why can't I have them? Or some of them." Don't worry, they won't miss what I take. I doubt there's more than one in 100 would even notice they're gone. But they're not yours, Miss Lawton. And they never will be. I'd give it up if I were you. What if people were to think Her Majesty was light-fingered if things go missing from every house she stays in? Keep your advice for someone who's interested, Mrs. Bates. Those doors play up something dreadful. They jam and stick for no reason. It's happened to everyone. Why didn't any of you look for me? I thought I'd seen you go out, Mr. Wilson. I'm afraid I was mistaken. Just as you were mistaken in not waking Monsieur Courbet. - We thought he'd gone out and all. - Oh. Thank you, Mrs. Hughes. Uh, a little more marmalade, if you please. The footmen have telephoned this morning. It seems it was a hoax that took them up to London. - But who would do that? - Who, indeed? We can investigate when we get to Harewood. I should be careful, Monsieur Courbet, unless you enjoy ridicule. - What? - I'd say the dinner was a success. They sent down their compliments, so I think it must have been. Well, then, why call attention to it? Would you show to advantage in this story, do you think? But what do we say if we're asked? There was a confusion in London. Monsieur Courbet was ill. If I were you, I wouldn't mention it. Not unless they bring it up. Quite right. There you are. I've been looking everywhere. What's the matter, darling? Is it something I can help with? Judging by last night, I doubt it. I just want to own my own life. I want to say things that I think and do what I like. - Don't you now? - No. I spend my time entertaining people who bore me to death because they're entitled to sit at our table. I attend committees that I haven't chosen because they've chosen me. I used to have a job that I loved, but not anymore. And now my husband won't be there when I have a baby. The woman in the lodge is entitled to that, but I'm not. Early warning. Their Majesties are getting ready to leave. Very good, milord. Darling, what's the matter? Nothing you can help with. Can't I try? Oh, uh, we should go up. Their Majesties are on their way. Oh, right. Come on. Up we go. So, you're off to London? They'll drop me at the station. Well, I hope we can keep in touch. I feel I've finally found a friend. Is that what you found, Mr. Barrow? A friend? - Their Majesties are going. - Thanks. I want you to have this. It's not much, but I've had it for years. It'll remind you of me. That's the point, isn't it? So you can think of me till we meet again? Thank you. Mr. Ellis, you must come! I hope you enjoy your time at Harewood, sir. Yes. I hope so, too. It isn't really goodbye when we'll see you all this evening. We're looking forward to the ball. Harewood is such a wonderful house. Well, let's mount up, shall we? - We'll see you later, Grantham. - Your Majesty. Well done, everyone. Shall we head back in? Mary, what are you wearing to the ball? Oh, I don't know. Carson, what happened to the royal servants last night? Hard to say, milord. They sort of gave up the ghost. Well, you managed splendidly. Although I could have done without Molesley's aria. But please thank the staff for saving the day. Oh, uh, Mrs. Bates? - Excuse me. - Can I ask you something? What did you give Monsieur Courbet? A double dose of a sleeping draught from Mr. Bakewell's... in his tea. I'm afraid I made rather a fool of myself last night. You could never be a fool to me. Do you mean that, really? I do. And I think you know how much. You're right, Mrs. Patmore. It's time I started to plan my wedding. Well, I don't know what took you so long. I wasn't sure before, but I am now. Well, that's good to hear. I'm happy, Mrs. Patmore. I don't often say that, but I am. Are you very shocked by it all? I should be. Interfering with the palace staff on a royal visit... and me part of it, to boot. I don't know what came over me. But? They had it coming to them, Elsie. Let's face it, they had it coming in spades. Hello. What's this? Welcome back, Mr. Talbot. Hello, Carson. Mrs. Hughes. Do you know where I'll find Lady Mary? After everything that's gone on, I should think she'll be lying down, sir. They all will be. Sounds ominous. That's nice that he's back in time for the ball. And thank the Lord we don't have to organize it. Oh, darling, you don't know what we've lived though. I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner. It was the first ship after the last meeting, I promise. Oh, never mind. You're here now. And I don't have to go to the ball alone like a sad little wallflower. Well, I'll only come if you promise - to dance with me nonstop. - Oh, it's a deal. - Good evening. - Your Majesty. I suppose Maud has brought that scheming little minx with her. If you continue in this vein, you will only make yourself look stupid. - What-what do you mean? - What I say. Are you keeping something from me? Come with me. What? Why aren't you happy? I thought you'd be delirious. Well, we are happy, if you mean it. Very. But how will you manage Henry? By altering the way we manage each other. And it may not be easy, but I've decided that I'm staying with him. I just don't understand what changed your mind. It was something Mr. Branson said about deciding what matters. For me, the Crown matters more than any of us. I can make it work. Branson? The Irish republican? Oh, you're well-informed. I'm better informed than you know. So, he persuaded you to do this? Oh, we were talking after the parade. Oh, there he is. Ah. Say something nice. Please. I have to say, it's been very quiet without you. Mr. Branson. I wish we had spoken more while we were at Downton Abbey. - Do you, sir? - Certainly. I believe I have more than one reason to be grateful to you. More than one. What was that all about? I'll tell you when we're alone. Why more than one? Who is she? That's Princess Mary. She was at Downton for the parade yesterday. Didn't you see her? Not at the parade. But I saw her afterwards at the tea. So, you see, she has Brompton blood, albeit from an unusual angle. Why did you not say this long ago? It seemed too great a leap for you. Well, who do you think I am? Some maiden aunt who's never left the village? Obviously not. Well, don't think I approve, because I don't. But at least I understand. Does Miss Smith know the truth? Yes, she does. When I get home, I will hire another maid, and Lucy can be my companion. Well, that's much more suitable. And I'm afraid you'll dislike it, but she says that she and Tom Branson have agreed to correspond. Dislike it? I will lick the stamps myself. You are amazing, Violet. You haven't won, you know. I don't believe in defeat. But we can hammer this out when you come back to stay, you and Lucy, when you've finished your tour of duty. You mean I am once more a member of this family? She's right, you know. Brompton is gone. And you must all learn to live with it. I think we can get it back. For Tom, at least. That's why we need the girl back here. Oh, Violet. After all these years, you still astonish me. Oh, good. I'm glad I'm a revelation and not a disappointment. - It's very important. - Quite right. - Oh, there they are now. Do ask. - Ah, yes. There you are, Hexham. I'm sad you can't be part of the prince's tour, but we'll find something else for you to do. - What? - Sir, I-I didn't, um... I understood why not, uh, as soon as Her Majesty had explained it to me. Congratulations to you both. You're looking very sunny tonight. I'm happy. Why? Does it bother you? No. But tell me, what are you playing at - with Tom and Cousin Maud's famous maid? - What do you mean? I heard you at dinner last night. What are you up to? You know she'll inherit the Brompton estate. - Well, so Mama told me. - Well, then, wouldn't you like Tom to have a proper establishment? Oh, you devious cat. Will they be happy? Do you think they will? Oh, I just want a word with Granny. How long were you planning to wait before you told us why you really went up to London on Wednesday? Since you ask, I haven't decided. So, if I tell you now, will you promise to keep it to yourself? I promise. Very well. I... I had some medical tests a few weeks ago, and I went up to London to hear the results. - Yes? - And, uh, I may not have long to live. It won't be too quick. But, of course, you can never get a London doctor to be precise. - Oh, Granny. - No. No, no. My dear, save your tears for something sad. Th-There's nothing sad here. I have lived a privileged and an interesting life, and now it's... it's time to go. I'm leaving the family and the place that I treasure in talented hands. - Well, I know Papa will be... - Oh, no, no. No, I don't mean your father. I... No, I-I love him dearly. No, I... I mean you. You are the future of Downton. But I have such doubts, Granny. Are we right to keep it all going when the world it was built for is fading with every day that passes? Will George and Caroline still be living that life? - Are we living it now? - No, no. Our ancestors lived different lives from us, and our descendants will live differently again, but Downton Abbey will be part of them. Won't be the same without you. Of course it will. You'll take over from where I left off. You'll be the frightening old lady keeping everyone up to the mark. Thank you very much. You will, my darling. And you'll do it wonderfully. You're the best of me that will live on. Hurrah. Oh, Granny, I love you so much. No, shh. But should you be here tonight? Won't you be worn out? Oh, Mary, I can't spend the rest of my life in a shower of "How are you feeling?" and "Are you quite well?" Oh, no. The point is... I'll be fine until I'm not. That's all there is to it. Ah, there you are. - The dancing's starting. - Ah. You mustn't miss it. No. Thank you. Thank you. You know, you'll always be with us, Granny. Staring from every picture, talking from every book, as long as the house stands. Sounds very exhausting. Do you know, I think... I should prefer to rest in peace. Come on. Darling. What is it you want? We have things in common. The boys, horses, racing. And there must be more if we look for it. I want us to be friends. Well, we'll have to see. No, dear. We'll have to change. Both of us. How did that happen? Was it you, Mama? How did you do it? Simple. Bertie asked the king. I asked the queen. I do love our adventures. But isn't it fun when they're over? What are you doing here? I wanted to see the dancing, so I thought I'd pretend I was bringing Lady Bagshaw a handkerchief. I can give it to her, if you'd like. I wish you could dance with me. I've got a question for you. Hmm? You'd never want to leave Downton and start up somewhere else, would you? And tell me truthfully. What brought this on? Just tell me. Leave Downton? I think we're stuck with it, aren't we? Yes. Yes, I believe we are. We shouldn't come out this way. Oh, they won't mind. Not this once. Well, they've gone, and Downton is still standing. Elsie, a hundred years from now, Downton will still be standing. And the Crawleys will still be here. And that is a promise. We'll see, Charlie. We'll see.
