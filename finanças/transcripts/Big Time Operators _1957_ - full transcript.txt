I shall never forget that day. Matt was only halfway through the novel, and our funds were running low. Then, the letter arrived, which was to change everything. Jean. Darling? When did this come? What? Oh, just now. I didn't want to distract you. Why, what is it? Matt. Great-uncle Simon. I didn't know you had a great-uncle Simon. Well, I didn't have a great-uncle Simon. Sole heir... The whole estate, Sloughborough, Worts... Oh, some mistake. I never had any great-uncle Simon. But you must've had a great-uncle Simon... I tell you, I didn't. Surely, if I had a great-uncle Simon, I'd least of heard of a great-uncle Simon. Simpson, Carter, and Son. They must be out of their minds. It says will you get in touch with them. Sloughborough. What's that, Trunks? It must be. Neither have I. Great-uncle Simon. Great-uncle Simon. Oh, Operator. This is Northway 0267, I want Sloughborough, Worts 29. Oh. Oh, is it? It's Sluff-borough. Matt? You couldn't be... Couldn't be what? You couldn't be inheriting a fortune, could you? Because if you are, let me say right now, I love you more than ever. Darling, don't be so silly. No, no, no, not you operator. You know, I had a great-uncle Hugh, and a great-uncle Edward I think, but, hello? Oh, Simpson, Carter, and Son? Oh, my name's Spenser, Matthew Spenser. Yes, I think the point is that there's been some idiotic mistake because I can tell you quite definitely, I never had a... What? I beg your pardon? Oh. What? I did have a great-uncle Simon. Oh! Yes, just hold the line one moment, will you? The secretary wants to know when we can come down. Well, I think we can come right away. Yes, today. Yes. Paddington? 11:10? Matt, we'll never do it! Yes, yes, I think we can manage that. Uh, oh. Do you by any chance happen to know anything about the estate? We'll never get that train, what is it? A cinema? He owned a cinema! What? Oh, just one other thing. Did you by any chance happen to know my great-uncle? Was he a huge fat man with a reddish beard who wore a sort of cape? Oh, oh, well that must've been my great-uncle Edward. Look, darling if we don't... Oh, well it doesn't matter. Yes, tell Mr. Carter we'll be there, will you? Yes, goodbye. Matt, we've only got 40 minutes. What am I going to wear? Imagine not even knowing. And what's more, great-uncle Simon seems to have been rich. Did she say how... Well, she said she couldn't talk on the phone. But if apart from anything else, he owned a cinema. He must've been wealthy. And you really inherit everything? The solicitor said so. It's incredible, it's absolutely incredible. Thank you. Oh dear, honestly, I'll pass out before we get to Sloughborough. Just think what it'll be like to have no more money worries, no more stupid, petty problems. To be able to do all the things one wants to do, to travel, for example. Oh yes, you know that's just the one thing that would be heavenly. Think of all the fabulous places that are just names to us now. But we can see. Samarkand, Samarkand. Doesn't that do something to you? Doesn't the very name... Oh, it's a beautiful name. Samarkand. San Francisco, Seville, Samoa, Samarra... Tell me some more about Samarra. Oh, darling. Oh, I'm sorry, it's the brandy. Well, here's to Samarkand. Oh darling, I can't drink any more. To Samarkand. Train now standing at platform three, is the train for Dorne, Bradfield, Rewesley, Wickhamford, Evercreech, Woodbury, and Rickersworth. What is that ghastly smell? There's something dead around here. Well, you mean besides great-uncle Simon? Oh, sorry, darling. Tell me, what's that curious smell? Eh? That smell, what is it? I don't smell anything. Oh, you mean the glue factory. That's it, the glue factory over there. Pungent, isn't it? Pungent is hardly the word. Taxi, sir? Yes, please. Will you take us Simpson, Carter, and Son, the solicitors? Right, sir. Now listen, darling. While you're with the solicitors, a little dignity, eh? I mean to say, if a man dies, and leaves you his entire inheritance, the least you can do is to observe the propi, proprietree, propiturie... Proprieties. Darling, you can talk, you can't even say proprieties! Proprieties! Now darling, really. Try and be sensible. Matt. Look! Driver, stop a minute! Driver, how many cinemas are there in Sloughborough? Just this one, sir. Matt, it's simply magnificent. It must be worth a fortune! Driver, just wait here a minute, will you? I say, how's business? What? I said how's business, how's business these days? I wouldn't know, I mind me own. What a rude man. Do you know something? I think that chap's got a little surprise in store for him. What do you mean? There's no excuse whatsoever for incivility. The very first thing I'm going to do is to boot him right out of the place. Oh darling, I'm sure he didn't mean to be... Nonsense, it's his job to be polite, not to... Wait 'til he finds out who he was being rude to. Come on, let's get to the solicitors. My father asked me to handle this matter for you, Mr. Spenser. I told him you were calling, but he said he had an urgent appointment. I don't think he'll be gone long though. But, you know something about it, don't you? Oh, yes. I know all about it. As a matter of fact, I've had the job of establishing your existence. You've no idea the fun and games I had. Thought I'd never catch up with you. Glad you did. As my secretary said, that she told you on the telephone that the estate includes a cinema. Yes, yes she did. Yes, well apart from a few personal effects, and furniture, and such like, I'm afraid that the cinema itself is all there is to your great-uncle's estate. Oh. Still, that's quite enough, isn't it? He had everything he owned tied up in it, had he? Incidentally, we've seen the cinema, Mr. Carter. Oh, you have? The question is really, how much is the place worth as it stands? Lock, stock, and barrel? Well, it's rather difficult to say. But even approximately, in round figures. Is it worth a hundred thousand pounds? A hundred thousand? You see, I haven't a clue about these values. But as cinema's go, this one surely is quite magnificent. Well, we are almost overwhelmed. I mean, it's quite as splendid as all those in Leicester Square. Mrs. Spenser... What is it? What's... My dear chap... Mr. Carter, what is it? I'm afraid, I'm very much afraid, I wonder if my father's back. Dad? He's not back. Mr. Carter. I'm most terribly sorry, Mr. Spenser, Mrs. Spenser. Sorry? Mr. Carter, what's the matter? You see, I hardly know how to tell you. Well, if you could find a way, Mr. Carter. Well, may I ask which cinema have you been looking at? Which cinema? You mean, there's more than one? Yes. And it's not the Grand? But why did that taxi driver say that there was... Well, he must've meant it was the only one open. You see, we had to close the Fleapit the day after... The Fleapit? I'm most terribly sorry. Fleapit? Please forgive me, you see, it's always referred to locally as the Fleapit. I should've said the... Well, I'm sure there is a business like show business, but somehow I don't think this is it. Look at it. You mean to tell me my uncle actually charged people to go in there? That people actually paid? Yes, some. Seems impossible. Did he run it himself? With a staff of sorts. Three of them, actually. They're all under notice, of course. Well, shall we take a look inside? Couldn't we just go away and forget it ever happened? Mm, pungent, isn't it? The cashier? Mrs. Fazackaleee. I'll lead the way, shall I? Oh, the old place has been everything in its day. It was a theatre way back before they built the rail way, then it was a musical. I wonder how my great-uncle got mixed up in all this. Well, it was before the First War, apparently. The young Simon must've had quite a way with him. He even managed to get some of the local people to put their money into it. My dad did, as a matter of fact. Spenser's Electric Theatre, it was called in those days. The first in this part of the country. Oh, pussy, here. Does anyone look after her? Yes, Old Tom. Oh. Aw. Come on. Come on, darling. Matt! What's that? Oh, that'll be the 4:15 to Stoke. Do these things work? Well, yes. I think so. The projectionist? Mr. Quill. Your great-uncle's private apartments. I say, is one of these... Oh, that's your great-uncle on the left, taken some years ago in the Railway Arms. Wait a minute. It's all coming back to me now, I do remember him. We were all staying at my grandmother's, I think. Of course, I was only a kid at the time, but I remember there was some trouble about a chambermaid. That would be Simon. Is this where, did he? No. As a matter of fact, it was in the Railway Arms that your great-uncle... He died in a pub? Rather sad, really. You see, for many years, Simon was champion beer drinker of this county. Used to down a whole gallon of brown ale in a single draught. Eight pints? On the evening of the 19th in the Railway Arms, somebody bet him. He shouldn't of tried it, you know? Not at 77. Would it be irreverent to ask if he... Oh, yes. He did it, alright. The 10 shillings was paid to me as executor, right after the funeral. Sad. Somehow, not unfitting, you know? Well, what in heaven's name are we going to do with it? Could we sell it? Well, astonishing as it may seem, Mr. Spenser, your great-uncle had an offer for it only a few weeks ago. From Mr. Hardcastle, the man who owns the Grand Cinema. But what on earth would he want with this place? I'll show you. You see the Grand there? Hardcastle's idea is to use that land as a carpark. Now, the only way he can do that, is to buy the Bijou and pull it down to make an entrance. Old Simon would never sell. Any idea what Hardcastle was offering? Oh, the last offer was 5,000 pounds. 5,000 pounds? And the old man turned it down? Well, it was his home, you know. As well as his living. That's not bad. Not bad at all, is it darling? When can we see Mr. Hardcastle? - Well... - Now? Today? I'll see if I can arrange a meeting this afternoon. Well, you'll have to excuse me, Mr. Spenser, but I'm rather a sentimental man, and old Simon's death came as a great shock to me. Very great shock indeed. Mind you, I never got to know him awfully well, but he were business rivals in a manner of speaking, and I liked him. He was a very likeable man, you had to like him. I did anyway. But still as I say, Mr. Spenser, I'm a very sentimental man. Yes, Mr. Hardcastle. We quite understand how you feel. The point is, now that Mr. Spenser here has come into his great-uncle's estate, we have to consider the whole question of the Bijou. The Bijou? Oh yes, the Bijou. Now, I've explained to Mr. Spenser that you made an offer to the late Mr. Spenser. That's right, lad. I made him a very fair offer. But the old rascal, if you'll pardon the use of the expression, ma'am. Please. The old rascal turned it down flat. Well, I daresay he had his reasons, Mr. Hardcastle. But I'm prepared to consider your offer very seriously. Here, hold fast a minute, lad. What offer are you talking about? Well, your offer of 5,000 pounds. 5,000 pounds? 5,000 pounds? Oh, he's a great one. Your husband, just like his great-uncle. 5,000 pounds! Oh, that's a good one. Oh, that's a great one! 500 will be more like it. But I don't understand. You offered my great-uncle... Oh, I know, lad. But that was a long time ago, before television hit us. And the Bijou was a going concern then. Have you seen it now, lad? No, I'm only offering you 500 pounds, and that's a good deal more than the old Fleapit's worth. If I may interrupt, Mr. Hardcastle, an offer of 500 pounds is quite out of the question for my client. Why, there are debts of at least 750. 750? Well, alright. Everyone knows I'm a sentimental man, and I liked old Simon. 750 then, but not a penny more. I'm sorry, Mr. Hardcastle. I didn't mean that figure to be taken as one which my client will be prepared to accept. No, well, that's the figure I'm prepared to offer. 750, and no more. Well, I'd like to have a word with Mr. Carter before I... Now take your time, lad. Take all the time you want. I'm not gonna be down out of my inheritance by Mr. Albert Sentimental Hardcastle. What about your father? My father? Well, couldn't we drag him in? Ask his advice? Confidentially, my dad's always managed to steer a bit clear of old Simon's affairs. He said he wouldn't touch this with a bargepole. You know, I think my dad's right. Unless... Unless what? Unless you made Hardcastle believe that you didn't want to sell the old Fleapit. Hm? Well, you could tell him you were going to reopen it, and manage it yourself. You're not actually suggesting that we start up the... No, no, no, no, of course not. But you gotta make him think you're going to. As soon as he sees you cleaning your place up... Yes, you've hit on something. As soon as he sees where we're... Exactly. If he thinks the old Fleapit's going to open up again... He's bound to pay us what he was going to pay my great-uncle. Quite, quite, that's precisely my point. Yes! It's a wonderful idea. I'll do it! That's it, it's a wonderful idea. Taking on the staff, and doing the place up. Oh, we'll get it all back. We'll have to be convincing, don't you see that? If Hardcastle thinks we're bluffing, he'll just laugh. You know. But if on the other hand, the bluff works... It could mean 5,000 pounds. Oh, do let me do that for you. Darling, I can do it. Oh. Well. What's so funny? Samoa, Samarra, Samarkand, Sloughborough. Before we go in, there's something I think I should tell you about Mrs. Fazackalee. You see, Mrs. Fazackalee and your great-uncle were, that is to say, their relationship wasn't entirely, well, how shall I put it, um... You've already put it very eloquently. Your family. Oh, and, and one other thing. If I were you, I shouldn't say anything to these three about wanting to sell the place. They must think you mean to open. Small town like this, you know. Things get about. Quite. Good morning, Mrs. Fazackalee, Mr. Quill, Tom. May I introduce Mr. and Mrs. Spenser, the new owners of the Bijou. Mrs. Fazackalee, the cashier. How do you do? How do you do, Mrs. Fazackalee? Mr. Quill, the projectionist. - How do you do? - How do you do? - And how do you do? - How do you do? And Old, where's he gone? Oh, it's alright, Tom. Mr. and Mrs. Spenser just want to meet you, there's nothing to be nervous about. Old Tom, the janitor. How are you, sir? Yes. Well, I've asked you all here because Mr. Spenser would like to say a few words to you. Mr. Spenser. It's alright, Tom. Mr. Spenser just wants to talk to you. What's he going to say? Well, I'd like to say that... I know who you are. You're Mr. Carter. That's right, Tom. He thought I didn't know him. Mr. Carter, I've known him since he were a lad. Well, first I'd like to say that although I hadn't seen my great-uncle for many years, I was very sorry to hear of his... I understand... You're not Mr. Carter. He's Mr. Carter. Yes. Yeah. Well, what I wanted to say this morning was, that we, that is wife and I, we intend to reopen the Bijou, to reopen it as quickly as possible. Any questions? Mrs. Fazackalee. The late Mr. Spenser was going to make a number of improvements before he... Yes, Mrs. Fazackalee? For one thing, he was going to do something about the rats. Rats? Yes, you see... Tell him about my equipment. I'm explaining to him about the rats. My equipment's more important than your rats. Did you tell him about my uniform? If you'd kindly permit me to speak. Well, I can see that we all have a lot to talk about, we must discuss it all later. Well, I'll be off and leave you to it. You must all have a lot to do. I'll see you out. I'll come with you. You and your equipment, hm? If you'd spent your time looking after it, instead of boozing away out there. Boozing? Yes. You stand there and accuse me of boozing? Yes, I do. Well, I'll let old Hardcastle know you're proposing to put him out of business, right? Right. And don't let those three in there upset you. It's just that they've been in the old Fleapit a bit too long. Bye. Bye. Fleapit? More like the Snakepit. You kept it running? I kept... I did. Why, if it wasn't for me, poor Mr. Spenser would've gone out of business years ago. You and Mr. Spenser? Oh, yes! We know all about you and Mr. Spenser. How dare you! You unspeakable, drunken blackguard! Mr. Spenser promised me a uniform like the man at the Grand has. I've got my troubles too, haven't I? Is anything wrong? Mr. Spenser promised me a uniform, like the man at the, who are you? He's Mr. Spenser. Is he? Yes, I'm Mr. Spenser, Tom. Mr. Carter just introduced us. Well, he promised me a uniform. Just like the man at the Grand has. He promised me. Well, I'm sure we'll get around to all of your problems in time. Right? But first, well, I've gotta see if I can learn how my great-uncle ran his business. Is that alright with you, Mrs. Fazackalee? If those are your wishes, certainly. See you two later. He's going to see us later. Yeah, yeah. This is fantastic. What? Who are you? Well, Mrs. Fazackalee, I don't know very much about bookkeeping, but it seems to me these figures don't make any sense at all! I beg your pardon! Didn't my great-uncle keep any proper accounts? Your great-uncle never kept anything, Mr. Spenser, that wasn't perfectly proper. Oh, of course. Of course. But, well, what are these, for instance? Groceries, farm produce, miscellaneous donations? You see, the late Mr. Spenser always found that the only way to run the kinema successfully was by having a great many private understandings. What sort of understandings? Complimentary seats were always granted to anyone who made any contribution. If a farmer gave my great-uncle a chicken, his family got in for nothing? That's it exactly. But what about the entertainments tax? Surely by not selling tickets, he was defrauding the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It only seems like that, Mr. Spenser. But as the late Mr. Spenser always pointed out, you could hardly send, well, a third of a chicken to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Now could you? Oh, just before you go, I think I ought to tell you, Mr. Spenser, that unless something is done about Mr. Quill, I am not prepared to continue in my present position. Oh? I can no longer tolerate his insulting, and unseemly behaviour. Well, what are you suggesting, Mrs. Fazackalee? That I should give him the sack? Sack Mr. Quill? Sack Mr. Quill? Oh, I'm afraid that would be quite out of the question, on account of the projection equipment, you know. Nobody else could possibly understand it. In fact, in 1937, when Mr. Quill had to go and have his appendix out, and the late Mr. Spenser called in another projectionist to take over, it was only three days before he had to have his appendix out. Oh. No, no. No, I merely wondered whether you would say something rude or unpleasant to him. Very well, Mrs. Fazackalee. I'll try and think of something to say. Excuse me. Ah, well, well. Well, I wonder whether I could have a word with you, Mr. Spenser. Well, if it's about your equipment, Mr. Quill, I... No, what equipment? Well, the equip... No, no, no. It's about... It's about that woman, sir. That Mrs. Fazackalee. She's a troublemaker, sir. She does nothing else but make trouble. Make trouble here, make trouble there. Oh. Yes, well... Well, now that the old scoundrel's dead... Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. No offence intended, I assure you. But now that the old gentleman's gone to his dear rest, do we have to have that awful old hag hanging around this place? What do you suggest I do? Sack her? Sack Mrs. Fazackalee? I don't think you properly appreciate the position, Mr. Spenser. Mrs. Fazackalee's been here since the silent days. She used to play the piano. She's the only one what knows how this place runs! Sack Mrs. Fazackalee? You'll be wanting to sack Old Tom next. I see. What you really mean is, you just want me to say something rude and unpleasant to her. Yes. Yes. Well, I'll try to think of something to say. Yes. Good morning. Bijou Kinema at your service. Who? What, haven't you heard? Oh, yes. Yes, this Mr. Spenser. Of course. Just hold on a moment please, while I hand him the telephone. Thank you, Mrs. Fazackalee. Hello? Well, Hardcastle seems to be falling for it, alright. Yes, fine. The old wotsit may not move until he's absolutely convinced you're not bluffing. What? Well, you must be convincing. Spend a few pounds as ostentatiously as possible, of course. In my judgement, you'll get it all back. Mr. Quill! They're going ahead, alright. No doubt about that, Albert. Aye. 11 o'clock you said he said. It's 10 past now. Perhaps you're fast, darling. Perhaps he's changed his mind. Look here, if you two carry on like this when he shows up, he'll offer you a fiver for the place. For goodness sake, remember. You're the reluctant sellers, he's the anxious... That's our boy. Good morning to ya. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Mr. Hardcastle. Good morning, Mrs. Spenser. Ah, I see you've cleaned the whole place up a bit. Ah well, it needed it. And I give you a capital E for effort, lad. Both of ya. Well, we haven't really started yet, have we darling? We'll need a good deal of time before... Hold on a minute, that's what I wanted to see you about. Oh, thank you. It won't do, you know, it won't do. A nice young couple like yourselves. You've no business in this business. If you'd seen your great-uncle, what it did for him in the end, and that old Battle Axe Fazackalee. I remember when she was a wee slip of a thing. Pretty as a picture. A B picture mark, you. No, I'd have been round here sooner only it took me some time to convince my partners that we should raise our offer. Oh, darling, you're not going to sell now after... Oh, it's alright, darling. There's no harm in hearing what Mr. Hardcastle has to say. And what I have to say lad, is this. I'm prepared to offer you 1,500 pounds. 1,500 pounds. I'm afraid we're all wasting time, Mr. Hardcastle. Oh, a few weeks ago, my clients were more than willing to negotiate a sale. But then of course, they had no intention of opening up the Bijou. And making it our home. Yes, they've already invested a lot of capital in this place, you know. Oh, I know, I know. But you didn't expect me to make my best offer straight outright, did you? What is your best offer? Well, I'm authorised to go to the sum of 2,000 pounds. In cash. Mr. Hardcastle. What you and your partners are overlooking is the wonderful challenge the Bijou presents to my clients. Why, in six months time, we'll say a year. In a year's time, we hope to have... Well, goodbye lad. Are you going? Goodbye, Mrs. Spenser. Goodbye, Mr. Hardcastle. Thank you for coming. Goodbye, Mr. Carter. Goodbye. Now what were we saying? Yes, I think you should install CinemaScope. Full stereophonic sound, the lot. No expense spared. I agree. Well, we've got to make the Bijou the best little cinema in this part of the country. By the time we're finished with it, people will be coming from miles around. And... It's alright, it's alright, he's gone. I say, you don't think we overdid things, do you? Not a bit. Mark my words, within 24 hours, he'll be back with a bigger offer. All you've got to do now is sit down and wait. And give me a ring when he turns up, eh? What do we do if he doesn't? Oh, he will, don't worry. Hardcastle needs that carpark badly, and he's got to buy the Bijou to get it. Well, one thing seems pretty certain, he thinks we intend running the place. The moment we've cashed his check, I tell him. Nothing on earth would've induced us to open this dump. Cup of tea please, Miss. Alright, alright. Not worth talking to, I know that. Got no proper uniform, I haven't even got a proper hat. He promised me, and then he had to go and die. Why don't you get your new bosses to buy you a uniform? They won't buy me nothing. Why not? They seem to be a couple of mugs. Must be if they're opening up the new Fleapit, eh Dolly? They're not opening it. What? Didn't tell us nothing about it. Us who've been there 30 year. Except me, I've been there 40 year. What haven't they told you, Tom? They're only doing it so Mr. Hardcastle will buy it. They don't want to run the old Bijou. Never meant to run it, never meant to get me no uniform neither. If they really mean business, there's only one thing to do, Albert, and that's stump up. Ah, but it's giving best to a couple of youngsters that I don't like, Fred. You mustn't let your personal feelings interfere with business, Albert! That carpark's worth more to us than the 5,000. Oh, I know. Oh well. If we must, we must, I suppose. Get me the Bijou. Come in! Can I have a word with you, sir? We shouldn't waste too much time on this place, darling. I thought we ought to give him something clean for his 5,000. You know, I've been thinking. There's one thing about this situation that worries me. What? I'll bet if the old man had made a proper will, he would've left this place to those three old goons. I mean, why shouldn't he? He didn't even know I existed. Well? Well, so I haven't really come into my inheritance, have I? I've come into theirs. When we get that 5,000 pounds out of old Hardcastle, we ought to give them a fair share. Oh, Matt. You've no idea how pleased I am to hear you say that. You know, I've really begun to quite like them. Matt, you're sweet. Matt, Hardcastle's found out! But how could he have found out? I just don't know. But he knows you're bluffing. Look, I better come round. He says he's still willing to give you the 750 when you decide you've had enough. Well, that tears it. It certainly does. I must say, I feel very largely to blame for this situation. If I hadn't urged you to hold out... Of course you're not to blame. Oh, Robin, you mustn't even think of it. The point is, what do we do now? You know, when you think about it, the situation hasn't really changed. The fact that Hardcastle's found out and reduced his offer doesn't alter the basic fact that he still wants to buy the Bijou. He thinks you'll panic and accept the 750. Well, I'm in a panic. Have we any alternative? You have one. What's that? Well, I hesitate to mention it. Oh, don't. Please, Robin. Well, open the cinema. Run the place. Run the place? Why not? You mean, actually show pictures? Yes, sooner or later he'll have to raise his offer again. Stay here? You mean, stay here and really try to... No, no, no, no, no. Now, wait a minute. You want us to live here? To be stuck in this place? Do you mind telling me what single aspect of this situation strikes you as being even remotely amusing? Oh, I'm sorry, darling. It's just that there's something so terribly logical about being stuck in a place that makes glue. And that was our plan. It's true, we didn't intend to open the Bijou again. But just to sell it for as much as we could get. But because we feel that this place is as much yours as it is ours, we were going to see that you were all well looked after. Somehow or other, we don't know how, Mr. Hardcastle found out. Now all he'll give us 750 pounds, which will hardly cover the debts. Wait a minute, Tom. I haven't finished yet. Robin, go and explain to him, will you? Right. Well, we decided, my wife and I, to really open the Bijou, and once more, to make a success of it. We've got to. If ever Hardcastle changes his mind and we make a sale, we'll see you all get a fair share. Well, I hardly know what to say, I'm sure. It's very good of you to think of us all. We'll do the very best we can, I'm sure, Mr. Spenser. Just as we did in Mr. Spenser's day. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Fazackalee. Yeah. Well, Mr. Spenser. It's like this here. I would like you to know, well I appreciate what you said, and what you're trying to do. And believe me, I don't say this lightly, I am absolutely determined that I won't touch another drop, not another drop, I won't touch, I won't. Mr. Quill! I don't think you may realise, Mr. Spenser, what a big sacrifice this may mean for Mr. Quill. Well, thank you, Mr. Quill. Thank you, Mrs. Fazackalee. We shall really have to do something about your equipment now, Mr. Quill. Well, that's very nice of you to think of my problems, Mrs. Fazackalee. I'll get you some poison. What? For your rats, you know. Oh yes, I see. It was Old Tom who gave the game away. Oh no! Apparently he overheard something, and Hardcastle's commissionaire got hold of him. The old chap's in terrible shape. Oh darling, you must go and say something to him. Well, alright. Everything's perfectly clear to me now. We're going to be here for the rest of our lives. Matt will end up like great-uncle Simon, I'll be Mrs. Fazackalee, and you'll be Old Tom. Isn't that what's gonna happen? Tom. No. It were all my fault, sir. I'll go away, there's no place for me here. Now look here, Tom. I tell you what we'll better do. I think it's time we bought you that uniform. Grand reopening, grand reopening, seats at all prices, sir. Seats at all prices. Seats at all prices, seats at all prices. Any customers yet, Tom? Not yet, sir. But it's a happy day, sir. A very happy day, sir. The old Bijou reopened. Yes. We're happy too, Tom. Especially now I've got me uniform, sir. Very smart, Tom. Seats at all prices! Seats at all prices, sir. Grand reopening! Mr. Spenser. Aren't you going to press the button? Button? Yes, the one inside, for Mr. Quill to start you. Oh, yes. Hold your hat, here goes. Is there any point in starting if there's no one here? Well, I suppose we should show the pictures at the advertised times. Otherwise... Well, of course we should. Oh, oh. Oh, ooh. Ow! Shall we watch for a bit? It's free. I wouldn't miss it for anything. How. How. Any customers upstairs, Mrs. Fazackalee? Well, it's only 25 past five as yet, you know. Get down, we're in for a fight. Keep down. There you are, my boy. Well, don't be all day about it, I want to see the flick. The train's now standing at number three platform. Is the train for Flagport, Riverford, and North Hampshire. It's the Sheriff and his posse! Mr. Quill! Nothing to worry about, Mr. Spenser. The film broke, I'll have it fixed in a minute. They'll tear the place apart! Well, can't you say something to them? Certainly the old man always did. What do I say? Tell them to shut up and wait for it! We're doing our best! Blimey. Well? Quill says I should speak to them. Well, somebody better do something. Ladies and gentlemen. If you will be... You down there! I'll come amongst you! You were wonderful, you handled the whole thing beautifully. Filthy little brutes. I'd like to take them by the scruff of their necks! What on earth? Oh, Matt, you can't allow that sort of thing. Spread the word around, Mrs. Fazackalee. We're under new management, but no change in policy. But Matt... Here, cook it. Take care of 'em, boys! Come on! You see the idea? He's bluffing. He hasn't got a gun at all. Oh. Well, I guess that pays you off. You cannot arrest him, Sheriff. He has saved our lives! Mind, they'll be coming out any minute now. Say, Miss Julia. Let me introduce you to Driftin' Slim Stanley, Deputy U.S. Marshal. What is this? What's happening? Oh, Mr. Spenser. Here are the takings for the day. Oh. Three pounds, eight, and ninepence. Well, that's not very good, is it? It's always three pounds and something on a Monday, you know. Well, goodnight, Mrs. Spenser. Goodnight, Mrs. Fazackalee. - Goodnight, Mr. Spenser. - Goodnight. Oh, and there's a half of lard, and two pork chops in the drawer there. Complementarities. Goodnight once more. Complementarities. Do you think if we issued a few season tickets, we might acquire a radiogram or a refrigerator? By the look of half the takings, we shall need a refrigerator. Oh, goodnight, Mrs. Spenser. Oh, goodnight, Mr. Quill. - Goodnight, Mr. Spenser. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mrs. Spenser. Well, only one breakdown tonight. Only one. Yes. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. At the end of the first week, we simply couldn't believe it. We were making a profit. But we were! One pound, 17 and six. One chicken, two pork chops, half a lard, and tin of cocoa. What are we going to do? Well, perhaps we could find out how a real cinema is run. How? How. Oh, darling, for heaven's sake! Two singles at three and six. Two single seats. Two at three and six. Two singles, two single seats. Why, lad. Oh, and Mrs. Spenser. You don't have to queue, you know. You're always welcome as my guests. Thank you very much, Mr. Hardcastle. We just thought we'd take a sort of busman's holiday. That's right, lad. Come on in! Thank you very much. How's business? Oh, looking up, you know, looking up. Flat on it's back, looking up! Quite something, isn't it? Mm. Chocolates, sweets, ices, sweets, ices. Well, thank you. I think I've just had an idea. You're going to install a Wurlitzer for Mrs. Fazackaleee to play? Ices? Oh! Who did that? Oh, what? Orange, that'll be six... Oh, stop it! Well, look, please, would you mind not taking things off the tray? I can't! How dare you want that! Matt, please help! One and two please, Miss. Thank you. I saw what you did! She ain't your property, you see! Oh, I'm sorry now, Joe! I'd like to see you try! I don't know who you are, but I'm not having rowdyism in here! Get out. Get your hands off of me. You heard what I said. Do you want me to throw you out? Come on, Molly. You won't see us here again in a hurry. No hurry, son. We'll have the boys on you! Yeah! Yeah! Were you the cause of that disturbance? Nothing to do with me if they fight. Is it? That's a matter of opinion. I say, wait a minute. You wouldn't be looking for a good job by any chance, would you? What as? An ice cream girl, for instance. What, here? I'd pay well for someone who could attract the customers. Really? And stand up to the pressure of the work. You interested? Well, I don't know. I'm doing a bit of modelling for a photographer at the moment. He's got no heating, of course. What's the money? Well, let's discuss that in the office, shall we? What's your name? Hogg. Marlene Hogg. You know, I think you may be just the girl we need, Miss Hogg. Miss Hogg. Two orange! Thank you very much. Nothing to drink? Let me see, let me see! Hank! Where are you going, Hank? Water. Water. I can't carry on without water! Oh! I love Mike. Water... Oh, oh. Now! Ice cream, ice cream! Thanks for dinner, Robin. It's been a pleasure. And we had a lovely evening. I don't know if it's just the wine, but I certainly feel a good deal more optimistic. Oh, you have jolly good reason to be. Don't you worry. Hardcastle knows what business you're doing. Any day now, he'll be around with that check. Goodnight. Goodbye. Bye. Well, I hope he's right. Mr. Quill. Mr. Quill. What's going on? Old films, Mr. Spenser. Classics, you might say. I've saved them for years, bits of 'em. We used to run them like this in the old days, but not for years, we haven't done it. Now it seems like old times once more. They must be taking as much into refreshments as they are at the box office. Nearly a full house again tonight. Oh, they're bluffing, I tell you. They can bluff a long time while they're making money, Albert. Next week I heard they've booked a film about a drought in Arizona. Huh, they can't keep that up. They can keep it up long enough. In my opinion, we'd do ourselves a bit of good if we showed a few desert pictures, instead of all this kick in the belly, dump them over the waterfront stuff we keep showing. Bah! What's more, they've got the staff behind them. That drunken idiot of a projectionist has even signed the pledge. And have you seen their ice cream girl? Now look here, Fred, Sam. I'm not gonna lose my head over this. That setup at the Bijou is like a house of cards. If we huff and we blow... But what with, Albert? Leave it with me for a couple of days, will you? I think I may have a way of dealing with this. Here you are, Tom. Newsreel. The Relief of Mafeking. Oh, that's an old one. I don't know who believed that, I'm sure. There's a newsreel for ya. By the weight they are, I think I wouldn't like to have to carry too many of them. You could lose your arms out here. Right. Ta, Tom. Oh. Oh. Hnk? No. You're insane. Let me see! Hank! Where you going, Hank? I haven't had water! I can't leave without a drink. There must be water somewhere. I can't leave without a drink. I must have water. Now. There must be something, there must be something just to drink. Jesus, give me a drink. Anything, just a drop. Just a little drop. I can see it. I see it! It must be water there. Must get there, must get there. Water. Mr. Quinn! Percy! What's the matter? Come here, baby! My baby! Oh, Matt, Matt, Matt! Right! 10 to five. Where has Quill gone to? What are we going to do? We can't not open, can we? Do you know enough about his equipment to run it by yourself? I? Well, he doesn't know about it to... Very well, I'll have a go. Oh, that stupid, idiotic situation. I'll send Mrs. Fazackaleee to find out what's happened to him. I'm ready to start now. Anybody there yet? About 20. Well, here goes. Thank you. Is it alright? Aye, it's going like one o'clock. I'm telling you, Culpepper. This territory ain't big enough for you and me both. You better be out by sundown! Well, Sheriff. If that's the way you want it. Darling, are you alright? Yeah. Mrs. Fazackaleee says Quill's locked himself in his room and refuses to come out! How many people are there down there? Just about a hundred now. I thought you might like something to eat. I hadn't even thought about it. We've run out! 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, hoorah! As I was saying, honey. I reckon that you're just about the prettiest girl this side of Rainbow Gulch. I guess I'd better ride on back... One thing's crystal clear. We can't go on like this. Well, what else can we do? I don't know. All I know is we can't go on like this. Do you want to accept Hardcastle's 750? Of course I don't want to accept it. I can't stick at this job all my life. I'm a novelist. Yes I know, darling. But it seems such a shame after all the trouble we've taken. And there won't be anything at all in it for them. We're not responsible. It's Quill! Drunk all the time, always complaining about his equipment. If I could run the blasted thing without any trouble, why can't he run... Oh, no! Darling, what's happened? Film's broken. No! Alright, don't panic, don't panic! Don't worry. I've seen how Quill deals with this. Matt, what about all this film? Quill can sort all that out tomorrow. Can you fix it? I think so! All you do is that. Oh, shut up! I think that's right. Darling, do something! Well, there's a knob here somewhere, blasted! Ah. Oh! There's a focus control gadget. Who killed Art Link? I've never killed a man in cold blood before. Go away, I told you I didn't want to see you anymore. Oh, but honey. With my brains and your looks... That's it! That's it! Help, ma! I want you, ma! I'd work for you, honey. I'd even work out there on the railroad, stripped to the waste. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. It's not right! It's alright. Don't panic! What are you going to do? Well, we can scrap the rest of this, and switch on to the next reel. You think they'd notice? I don't know. If we go out, it'll be in a blaze of glory. I have to rewind! Just enough time to pick up a bottle of ttout at the Crown, Mavis. If we catch the 9:25. I think that's right now. I hope. That's it. Okay, come and get it. One and two. Ninepence. Oh, we got our money back tonight. After that evening, it seemed that there was nothing else that could happen. But there was. Yes, quite definitely. Second week in February, I should say. Where on earth have you been? Oh, I had an appointment, just... Well, nevermind about that now. Something terrible has happened, this is Mr. Hogg. Oh, how do you do. What do you mean something terrible... It's Marlene. What about Marlene? She's gonna have a baby. Oh, is that all? All? All? I don't know whether you appreciate it, madam, but my little girl's not wed! Oh. Oh, of course. I should've thought. I'm sorry. Oh, I should think so too. No father to put a name to it. It's an outrage! Well, it may have been. But haven't you any idea who the father is? I may have, and I may not have. What do you mean? - I say no more. - Why not? Never you mind. When she gets over her shock, and makes her allegations, I shall act. I'm warning you, Mr. Spenser. I shall act! Warning me? What's he getting at? Look here, I'm not having a... Matt, Matt, don't be silly. Let him go. Darling, I've got something to tell you. Mr. Spenser, Mr. Spenser, the cats had kittens in the circle. What? Six of them. What shall I do with them? Oh, not now, Tom. I'm busy! They're lovely little furry ones! Not now, Tom. There's four little girls, and one little boy. I've looked. Quill's just crept in. I'm going to have a baby. The second week in February. I'll go and speak to him, I have to sort out all that mess. One thing after another! What! Oh, oh! You're gonna have what the second week in February? A rabbit. I've gone through all the bills, Robin. 750 will just about cover it. You'll see Hardcastle in the morning, then. Oh, first thing. By the way, have you told the three of them? Not yet. It's not gonna be easy, you know. Poor Mrs. Fazackaleee. Poor Mr. Quill, poor Old Tom. We've done everything we could for them. From now on, you're all I care about. Pity, you almost made a go of it. Well, we never could've really. Not with a cinema like the Grand standing at our backdoor. Mind you, there have been times that I felt like burning that blasted place to the ground. Well, here's to the Bijou's last programme. So that evening, Robin, Matt, and I, watched the very last redskin bite the very last bit of dust. Jean, Jean! Jean! Hello, Robin? The Grand isn't there anymore. What? Well I'll be... No, we didn't hear a thing. Wait a minute. I thought the alarm went off, it must've been the fire bell. An oil leak? Yes, I see. What? He said what? I don't believe it! Well, it's obvious. Hardcastle has to stay in business until he can rebuild. And the Bijou's the only other theatre in town. And for the whole establishment, lock, stock, barrel, and debts, my clients are prepared to accept the sum of 10,000 pounds. Impossible! With two conditions. First, for Mr. Percy Quill, Mrs. Fazackaleee, and Old Tom, that's the only name we know for him, are to be allowed to carry on in their present positions as long as they way wish. But this is unheard of! It's outrageous! And secondly, that the name of the Fleapit, I beg your pardon, the Bijou, is not to be changed. Oh! In honour of my client's late, lamented great-uncle. I won't have it! If you don't settle this morning, Mr. Hardcastle, the price goes up this afternoon. But even the name of the place! At least let me call it the New Bijou. Yes, that seems to be alright. Good. Jolly good. The train now standing... Hi, Robin. See you in London. Next week. And by the way, dad's very pleased. Oh. Goodbye, my dear. Goodbye, Mrs. Fazackaleee. And I can't thank you enough, Mr. and Mrs. Spenser. I shall invest my emolument in some small pension. Before I spend it in other ways. I think that's very wise, Percy. Goodbye everyone! Bye! Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, God bless you. Have a nice time. Bye, bye, Tom. Take care of yourself. I like you, Mr. Spenser. And I like your missus. It was the only way, weren't it? Yes. Cheerio, bye bye. Goodbye. Bye, bye, Robin! Oh, what a scramble. Did you hear what he said? Who? Old Tom. Did you hear what he said? No, what did he say? But darling, what's the matter? Why you looking like that? What did he say? He said, I like you, Mr. Spenser, and I like your missus. It were the only way, weren't it? What were the only way? I don't know, that's what he said. - Matt. - No, now don't get excited. Matt. Don't get excited. There's probably nothing in it. He was always saying things that didn't mean anything. But, if he did do it... We'll have to go back and tell him, I mean, we can't just go off with Hardcastle's money and not even... What should we do? Well, I have to ring him. As soon as we get to... Hardcastle? No, Tom. I'll ring him and ask him in plain language... No, wait. I can't do that. It's not the sort of thing one can talk about on the phone. I better write him. That's it. I'll write him. Yes. Yes, you must. - Yes, I will. - Yes. I'll write to him. That's what I'll do, I'll write to him. And we did. We did write to him. We sent him a postcard, from Samarkand.
