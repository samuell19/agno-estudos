"Money is God" "Even the God is aware of it" "God knows it very well" "O Giver of Wealth! O Giver of Wisdom!" "O Giver of Undaunted Spirit!" 'THE MAGNANIMOUS ONE' "Only one man is the reason to all your lists of troubles" Hello, sir. Good evening. Hello, madam. Good evening! Hello, sir. This is Dr. Kannadasan. Didn't you come to my place some days back to enquire? Weren't you looking for an auspicious fertility centre? A child for yourself. A child of yours. Isn't your wife's happiness everything? The lengths we would go, to hear that tender voice... I'm not talking about chickens and ducklings here. Everyone needs their own little birdie! Sir, what is it that you truly need? A healthy child. - And what do we need the most for.. - Doctor? What we need the most for that, is... quality sperm. Sperm! That is both the secret sauce andspeciality of Murugappa Clinic. Keep that in mind! A hundred percent healthy heir. That's our guarantee. Guarantee, guarantee! O Lord Murugappa! Vanathi, don't even get me started on that! I'm so scared for him. I don't know what he is going to do with his future. He didn't come home for 15 days last month. He gets drunk with his friends every day. When I question him... he swears at me with no regard that I'm his mother. That sounds tough. Thank God. My son, Prabhu, is not like that. Parlour. Or sports. He is very responsible. Can you finish this soon now? Hello. Parambariyam Ayurvedic Centre. Wait, let me check. Who is it? Someone from Kamadhenu Supermarket. Who was sent to deliver the goods yesterday? They haven't received the stock yet. They just yelled at me for the poor service. Who went for delivery? Prabhu... This is such a wrong idea, Doctor. Just the mere thought of it is disgusting. Just because I can't do it... my wife will bear someone else's child? Prasanna, don't take this the wrong way... With growing wealth, our stress level also grows. That's the root cause of this problem. We are capable of doing some things... but there are things we can't do anymore. For example, if your wife doesn't cook one day, you aren't going to starve. You'd go to the hotel. Or you would use an app. And someone would deliver the food at your door step. The relationship between him and you ends at the door step. Correct, doctor. To him, it's a job. To you, it's a need. What ultimately matters is that you are happy! Come on. Stop! Go back. Make way. Look for a healthy sperm donor... who doesn't have family history of baldness. It will be better if he has curly hair! Curly hair, huh? - Really chubby... - With blue eyes. A poet! - A boy. - A girl! A dancer, like Tamannah. - But with the looks of... - ParavaiMuniyamma? No, like DeepikaPadukone. Pretty eyes is a must. With dimples. In this shade... mixed with this shade! Needn't possess my good looks, atleast my wife's complexion would do. Hello, Asian Paints? - Needs to win a medal at the Olympics. - How will she do modelling then? - I don't know! What modelling? - Excuse me? Please continue talking. I'll take a tea break? He is hardly 5 feet but wants a son as tall as Amitabh Bachchan! What am I going to do? You collected money from all patients, promising them a healthy sperm donor. If they find out we don't have a donor... prison food it is. I meant you'd be locked up, eating prison food. We sealed the deal with rope that doesn't even exist. Now all we need to do is make some rope. Cheers! All these days, we struggled with no patients at all. But now our clients are queueing up outside. We need to keep up our word and repay their faith. Doctor... I honestly thought you would take all this money and make a dash to America. Kamu, even though you already had three children... when you knew you were going to have another child... your face lit up like an LED, didn't it? Do you think I would betray couples who are longing for atleast one child? Even if I face a problem... I'll pass you off as a rare animal from the Amazon forests... use you as the donor of the clinic and make money... but I won't run away. So, who is that donor? - You... - What? I didn't mean that. I meant you and I have to find him together. He must be here somewhere. O Magnanimous One! Where Art Thou? That seemed like a foul, didn't it? Back, back. Go back. Prem, pass! Shot, dude Come on, come on! Move in. Yes! Awesome. Good going, guys. - What's his name? - I think that is Ashiq. He played Forward last year. Prabhu, pass! Pass the ball, Prabhu. Prabhu! What's wrong with you, man? Play on... Foul! Is he stupid? Show off! “The future is all mine” “The kingdom of music lovers...” “...will be mine” When a friend performs on stage... you should cheer him up from the first row. You shouldn't go to some corner and enjoy a private session! I clapped so hard for that terrible performance... after you got drunk on a single pint! Shut up and walk! I'm so insulted. If I ever come by your house anymore... hit me with your dirtiest slipper. Sure, I will. Sir. That's my house. Oh, you think you're some Lord who owns the entire street? I'm going to see my Kalpana. Just watch how powerful my music is. Okay, Sid Sriram. Let's hear you sing. Sir, I get that you are an S.A. Rajkumar fan. But the poor girl doesn't get it. An artist is neither respected by his friend... nor his chick. Buzz off, dude. You drunk fool! What a wicked world. Get home safe. I know your true colours now! "Oh my dear!" Good night. Good night. Have you eaten? Mom! Great! You stay out all day claiming to play football. Why? You pretend to help us out at the parlour. I don't know what's on your mind. You are half-hearted at everything. Chill, Mom. Chill? I'm looking for a job. I've been shortlisted in 4-5 companies through sports quota. All thanks to football. Just wait and watch, I'm going to care for you like a Queen. No thanks. What happened to theKamadhenu delivery? Kamadhenu? Grandma! What happened? - Grandma? - I don't buy it. She ratted out on him earlier, and now she turns into his saviour! All okay? You killed it! Your sense of timing and performance is Oscar worthy! - What is this? - Peanut candy... - I was just craving something sweet. - Go ahead... Enjoy yourself. - You want some? - I don't want this... I heard there are noise cancelling headphones these days. What about it? You don't need to perform for me. I'll buy one when I get a job. Good night. Good morning, doctor. - Yes? - Just like you wanted... I've got all the star sperm donors lined up outside. They are ready. Are you? I'm ready! Ask them to come in. Kamu, what's this? This is in conversation with Dr. Kannadasan. Is speech your only problem, or...? All praise to the lord. My voice is my greatest asset. You seem like the active types. One needs to stay active. That's the way to a healthy body. I'm a filmmaker, sir. A Hindi film about sperm donation. I'm going to remake it. No less than eight children, for thirty generations. We're a legendary family. I can go the wham-bam way... give my stuff, and collect my money! - Such is our bloodline. - Careful! Kama, dispose this corpse. Sir, pay me the money! When will you pay me? I don't want any money! But I'll put this up on a big billboard in my town. A billboard? I come from a warrior family. I always carry my blade with me. The child will be born with a blade too? Doctor! Kama... Doctor, how many of them got selected? All okay? You beakface! I studied MBBS and FRCS in London. And these men look like bootleggers. You told me they were star donors? Is this even fair? Doctor, I can look for another round of... No! No thank you. Good morning, coach. Prabhu! Welcome, sir. - Hello, coach. - What was that game? Your pass had no precision. Your kick had no power. You need floodlights to get in the mood to play properly? Don't forget that your job prospects depend on this game. If I had scored that goal the other day, I would have definitely been selected. I don't know how long I have to wait now. You think you didn't get selected because you didn't score that goal? You could have been selected for that assist your made. But you went on that unnecessary solo run just to show off... those moves backfired. Look... the game isn't only about scoring goals. I'm telling you this because I'm a selector too. Faster! Here... Application forms. I already applied at the Employment Exchange. - This is a renewal form. - All the best. With your age and your points, you stand a really good chance. Make sure you submit it. - You took so long! - Calm down. Come, let's go The inauspicious hour is over. Hello, sir. The hour of death has begun! For Panneerselvam! What are they doing here? - Panner! - Selvam! Not to worry. Your wife conceived a child through our clinic, right? Are mother and child doing well? Doctor! Please don't think this is blackmail! It's simple. If you can hand over all the sports quota applications... he will make copies of it and return it in half an hour. If he doesn't, feel free to thrash him! I trusted you, like I'd trust an elder brother. I deserve to get thrashed! Wait, I'll get it. He considers you a brother? "No room for sentiments in this rushing world" This guy looks even more mediocre. Disgusting! How do I make dads out of these duds? Boy, come here a moment. - Will you be frying some fritters now? - Yes, sir. Use these papers for wrapping them. Prabhu! Wow... Woah! - Superb! - Special tea. Forget the special tea... We have a speciality here! Look at this. His name is Prabhu. No 4, Pillayar Temple Street, Triplicane. Let's go get him! - Get the vehicle started. - But he will fall down, doctor. - What do you mean? - Look, he is sitting on our vehicle. "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Is he the God of Romance? Is he the Son of a Tribal Princess?" "Is he a lone warrior? Is he an unrelenting embryo?" "The moment that I saw him, Lamps lit up, bells chimed." "As the wind swept his hair; Ilayaraja's music filled the air." "Isn't this a kind of love?" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped!" "Isn't his consent the key to my life?" "The ro-ro-royal prince!" "Isn't his consent the key to my life?" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped!" "Isn't his consent the key to my life?" "The ro-ro-royal prince!" "Is he the God of Romance? Is he the Son of a Tribal Princess?" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" Doctor, Prabhu wakes up at 4am sharp and does Surya Namaskar. Wow, that's the Creator's Hour! Then he goes to sleep. He wakes up again at 10:30 and may or may not take a shower... but he goes to his mother's beauty parlour. He performs all the services to the clients, from waxing to threading etc. Good! Does he have any other habits? Not much. If he has money, he drinks a little beer. His family have turned vegetarian for three generations now. Vegetarian? Anything else? Love? Relationship? Hookup? Breakup? This girl called Kalpana works at his mother's parlour. She has a one-sided love for him. Kalpana... forget her. Go on. After his father passed away, he fears only one person in his life. His football coach. His world begins with his mother and ends with his grandmother. A life with no stress. No stress! An important point. This is all good, what about the main matter? The matter is his main plus. How? His great grandfather was the 15th child in his family. He had 8 children. But his mother stopped with just him, keeping with the 90s trend. This is more than enough! - There is more! - More? Based on what his mother said, they are descendants of a royal family from Tanjore. Royal family? Pasupathi, start the vehicle. Mom... My coach told me to start eating eggs. What? For protein. He said sports people definitely need protein. Or the body will become slack. You don't need any protein other than spinach, legumes and milk! Did you know Swami Vivekananda was a top football player? Protein is just a superstition. You don't want to earn your father's wrath. Doesn't seem like it's your father's wrath. I know, right? Prabhu... If you do something for me, I will buy something for you. Get to the point. What will you buy me? Look at this. Whey protein. Pure vegetarian. What should I do? It's all packed and ready. You just need to drop it off at Grand Mall. It's for a regular customer. Make sure you deliver it promptly. The things I do for protein powder! Nidhi Mandana. It's just a delivery. Yes? Hi! Nidhi Mandana? Yeah? You are? Parcel from Parambariyam. Give it to me. Are you the delivery person, or do you...? Excuse me, I'm the owner! How could you say that? I mean, it's our own brand! A 100 year old tradition! We even have regular customers like you! Why didn't I know until now! I mean, I didn't know you were a regular. Morning, ma'am. Morning. The pride you take in your tradition doesn't come across in product presentation. Looks like ketchup packed with a takeaway meal. First, we need to respect ourselves. Everything else will follow. Let me deliver just this one thing tomorrow? Please? One more chance? What happened? Seemed like someone was watching you. Let it be... So, same time tomorrow? Okay. We need to start a new clinic. A big one. Doctor, alert! A mall is a mall is a mall, where we give them all. - Oh, what a mall! - Excuse me? - Yes? - What do you want? Nothing. - Actually... - Hello? Both of you have been following me for a while. Shall I call the police or the security? Son, please don't do any such thing! I'm a decent tax paying citizen. What is it, tell me? I need to have a private chat with you. Can you spare a few minutes, please? Yes, yes, yes... I said, a private chat. Son, why don't you buy me some food at that restaurant? We can have a free open chat? No need for that. Let's talk here. You are so friendly! Son... What do you... How do you feel about sex? What? Don't feel shy. Tell me. How do you feel about sex? Mr, who are you? Why are you randomly asking me such a question? I am Dr. Kannadasan, MD. Fertility expert. Wow, your palm lines look good. Don't hold my hand! Just leave... I feel a little uncomfortable. I know your embarrassment. Give me a minute, I'll explain it to you. I run a small fertility clinic atParrys Corner. I have a lot of patients. All of them have only one yearning. They want a child. Fine, but why are you telling me all this? To relieve their yearning... to fill that void... I am looking for a healthy donor. - Donor? - Yes. A Good Samaritan. Just like the generous Karna in the epic Mahabharatha... to compensate for the drought of my clients... I've come to ask you to make a donation. You want a donation? Why didn't you just say so? You were dressed in formals, so I couldn't have guessed. Would 500 rupees do? I didn't mean a financial donation. This is something else! Something else? Sperm. Sperm donation. Sperm? Something doesn't add up. Camera, huh? I knew it! This is one of those prank shows where you film with hidden cameras, right? I know! Technology has improved a lot. The camera is in the pen, isn't it? Tell me now... what should I do? Wait, I know it. If you enjoyed this video, Like, Share and Sub... Surprise, right? Stop pulling my leg. I'm off! He said everything except 'Hit the little Bell down below'! What is up with him? How does this look? It looks great! Right? It's terrible. It needs to be... It needs to be like her. Classy. What would you people know? Grandma, show me that? Hello? - One moment. - This looks good! But it's missing something. Prabhu, call for you. - Yes, Prabhu? - Hello? I am Dr. Kannadasan speaking. Tell me... We met at the mall the other day. The fertility clinic. Looking for a donor. Man! Why would you call me on my home landline? Actually, I think you aren't mature enough to understand what I'm saying. You can't hide from Dr. Kannadasan! [radio playing Tamil movie song] This looks really good. My dear angels! You have cracked it. This is really good! Hi, excuse me? - Hi. - Is Nidhi around? She has gone for a movie. With whom? I mean... how irresponsible, to go for a movie during work hours! Excuse me! She is a zonal head. What does that mean? That means she can go for a movie whenever she fancies. That makes me a Zonal Head too. Which movie has she gone to? - That row? - Yes, that's her. - Thank you. - Okay, sir. Hi! I need to talk to you for a minute. Yeah, sure. You could have atleastbought pop-corn or cold coffee? Is that all? I'll get it now. What do you want to talk about? You said something about our packaging... Here. Does this meet your standards? This is good. Thank you. Is that all? I like it. I meant I thought you were a really classy person... I didn't expect to see you watching a 'masala' film like this! So... do you even understand what's going on in the film? I am a Kannadiga. [speaking Kannada] So I understand Kannada. Your hair is beautiful... Why do you need Hibiscus Oil? They use this specifically for severe hair breakage. Is that so? So, you know everything about hair oils? Of course! If you have dull hair, you use chamomile oil. For dry hair, almond oil. For long lustrous black hair like yours, you use... Okay, I get it! The oil is not for me. It's for my aunt. Oh! Why don't you bring your aunt to the parlour? I mean... my mother and my grandmother... they will fix all her hair problems in a single sitting. Oh, really? Yeah! But call me before you come. 98842 98842. Because Prabhu isn't available all the time! By the way... I am Prabhu. Bye! See you. Sorry, I almost forgot. Bye. Ma'am, cold coffee and pop corn. I was told to convey that Mr. Prabhu sends his regards. Sir, what job have you applied for, at this age? I'm here to apply for the job vacancy atVandalur Zoo for brushing snakes' teeth. Buzz off, boy. Dude, don't look right away... but that uncle over there has been ogling at you. Not him again! Sorry, do you know him? No, I don't. Dude, looks like that line has fewer people. I'm going there. Dude... Aren't you ashamed to call yourself a doctor? Why should I be ashamed? You've come to a public place to find people for your disgusting job! It is not disgusting. It's a service. My clients come to me with tear-filled eyes... and beg me with folded arms. - Step aside, it's my turn. Here, madam. Sorry, sir. It's lunch break. Madam! Madam! Madam! Can you please just take one more file? Take my file, madam. It's your fault! Now the counter is closed. I'll have to come back tomorrow now. Don't stress. Panneerselvam? Is your child doing well? Doctor! This young man is very dear to me. Take his file. Go on! Let's continue talking over tea? First of all, I don't like babies. Why? They poop and pee all over the place. We can't even watch a movie at the theatre in peace. Plus, the unnecessary expenses on powder, diapers, school, college etc. What if your father had thought the same way? Just saying. I am not asking you to birth and raise a child! All I ever need from you... is your sperm! Don't shout! My friends are here, and this is embarrassing. This is nothing to be embarrassed about! Human life on earth started from it. If you don't like that word, I'll refer to it as 'life'. You don't need to do this for free. It's a paid project. You could do with some pocket money till you get a job. How does it...? Do they have a tank to collect it? You don't keep it in a tank. You keep it in a bank. I have a bank! Sperm ban... Life bank. All I'm asking you to do is feed some life into it. "You reached the destination, Though you didn't even know the direction." "You found a petrol bunk, Just when the bike ran out of juice." "Will the Superman fall? Oh, will he fall? Will he fall?" "Will the Hunter fail? Oh, will he fail? Will he fail?" "You've got the rope to seal the deal; Cast your pole, and you will conquer sea." "Is he the God of Love?" The more you drink, the more it dies! What do you get from trapping me in this mess? I'm not trapping anyone. People fall into the trap on their own. Childlessness is the new cancer in today's society. Don't bring up the society for every little thing. Everyone is happy. Fine, let's talk about individuals. Everyone wants to make more money. They are greedy! Alcohol. Suspicion. Road Traffic. Working through the night. He works with the laptop on his lap top! You could make an omelette with all that heat. After he gets done at work, he comes to his flat and falls flat. His wife is next to him, fast and furious. But for him, family life is collateral damage. What can I do about it? Son, in the age of Instagram, you are still living a lazy country life. You don't have any work, so you are never under stress. You eat three healthy meals a day, so you sleep three times a day! After you wake up in the evening, rather than toying with a video game joystick... you go to the ground and play actual football! You are a medical miracle. You are 25 years old. You still have your own hair, and not a single one has turned Gray! Let's say I agree to do it... Agree to do it! Agree! - Hypothetically speaking... - Hypothetically? What is the certainty that this will work out? No certainty at all. Sometimes even you have a big tower, you don't get any signal down below. We will know if it works only if we make an attempt. Are you calling me impotent? I never said that. You need to cooperate to... Looks like you've started following me. This is a good idea! Before I could say something, you beat me to it. Hello! I've been playing here since I was a kid. I've been coming here for two years now. Come on. The other day, you said you were a regular customer. Today, you say you've been coming here for two years! We've been so close to each other. Wonder how I missed you. You were alone the other day when I saw you at your work place... at the theatre, as well... and now, here. Do you enjoy being alone? You are alone now, right? Yes, I love it. But at my work place, and the theatre... and even now at this cafe... you don't seem to leave me alone! Coffee? So, what do you do? I play football. I meant, what is your job? Yes, it is football! I used to be a good football player from my childhood... I got into high school and college through sports quota. I've even applied for a job through sports quota. - Nice! - I'll surely get it. It isn't a fancy job like yours... but getting a job through sports quota is awesome! I agree. Sports people always got special treatment in my school. I used to be so jealous. Which school? St. Joseph's Convent. I was born and raised in Coorg. I came to Chennai for college. Then I didn't have the heart to go back. Obviously. It's our Chennai! Little one... Come here. What are you doing here, all by yourself? Where are your parents? Sir, I've come to the beach. I'll get it done when I go home. - Sir, I understand it's urgent. - Excuse me? You left your son to play alone, so you could talk over the phone? I had to take an urgent call. He could have been swept away! What if he had been washed away? There are people out there who yearn for a child. Thank you, brother. Look after him. Take care. Boy, why do you make me listen to an earful from strangers? Not bad! What? Nothing. Let's go? You said you'd bring your aunt to the parlour. When are you bringing her? Doctor, take this pill. Is your headache gone? You just gave it to me! But it works immediately in the advertisements! Let's take an MRI scan, just to be safe? Private hospitals have corrupted you! Go on. Doctor, you never listen to me. I don't know what you see in him... but if this continues for long, you are going to go crazy! Doctor, he doesn't pay any heed to you... why don't we try other options? Latha, there is something special about him. The little birdie told me. He didn't budge a little even when I constantly pestered him. That resolve is surely a sign of quality life within him. I have one final weapon! I thought doctors were serious people, but you are such a jovial person! Hello, Prabhu! Prabhu, you didn't even tell me you were doing business with the Doctor. Yeah, there is nothing wrong in doing this! If you are able to give happiness to so many families, it's a good thing. Vanathi, I've hired him to work as a personal trainer to a few VIP customers. Not everyone can be naturally fit like the two of you. They are uncomfortable letting people know they exercise to stay fit. Maybe he didn't tell you to protect the client's confidentiality. Oh? So the doctor blurted it out? Doctor, can you step aside a moment? Let's talk it out together. Let's take it upstairs. - Upstairs? - Let's go. - He wants to discuss business... - Go ahead. - Have a good talk! - You are unbelievable, madam! You are so fit for your age. Vanathi, he doesn't look like a doctor. He is a really simple man! Prabhu... Now that I have entered into your home, when will I enter into your heart? Stop it! You resorted to entering my home? You spoke with my mother and grandmother! Who are you anyway? Aren't you ashamed to do this? Are you really a doctor, or do you run some other business? Watch your tongue! You are going overboard. I am an FRCS doctor. What I asked you is legal too. This isn't something new, it's existed since the time of myths. Haven't you read them? No, I haven't. There's an unhappy childless family. Suddenly, a sage appears. He showers them with his blessings, "So be it!" A baby drops on their hands out of nowhere. This has been a part of our ancestral myths. The white people who colonized us convinced us not to believe in these myths... but made a business out of it and sold it back to us! I'm asking you to make use of that business opportunity! Are you okay with it or not? Just say it to my face! You don't know your own worth. Since she had a multiple organ failure, we have no choice but to remove the support system. Medicine alone won't cure her. She needs to have the will to fight, from within. Sorry to say this. Your wife has given up. Excuse me? - Sorry, Manoj. - The coach is here. I know it's difficult... but the decision is yours. Thanks. Sit down. No, sit! Sir, how is your wife doing now? I'll just be back in a minute. Why is he walking away? He doesn't look good. Coach? What happened? They said we have to take her off life support. They said they can't do anything. Sheela is falling apart right before my eyes. I can't bear to see it. I am not that strong. Coach? - I'm unable to look at her... - Coach. It's my fault, Prabhu. My selfishness. My short sightedness. I failed to see the pain behind her smile. She only wished for one thing. Our own child. She wanted to be a mother. I couldn't fulfil her wish. We went to all the temples and hospitals we could... The problem wasn't with her. It was me. Coach? I knew, but did nothing about it. Darned pride. Male pride. Even now, in her last thoughts, I'm sure she's worried for leaving me alone. Prabhu... Science has really grown. But I never did grow up, did I? Sophistication! That was the word I was looking for! Oh? We are going to settle down in Seattle. A child needs to adapt to that place. Yes! - It's highly competitive over there... - Yes, it is. I want a girl. LikeVidyaVox. Absolutely! You are specific about Petromax? I'll be right there! Don't worry. You got a star donor! Forget about VidyaVox. You can have Lady Gaga! Sounds good? Come back in a week's time. I will have everything ready. Should I pay an advance? I'll take the entire amount later. Thank you, Doctor. That Petromaxjoke was a little cheap! Do you think he will be able to pull it off? Don't be so negative. Maybe he will. Don't assume I'm here for your money. Okay... Also don't assume I will do this as a permanent job. Not required at all! If I feel uncomfortable, I won't do it. Very fair. This will stay a secret, right? A hundred percent. I promise! I swear on Lord Murugan. You can read through our company contract. I'm doing this for a personal reason. Not for the money. Come here. Come with me, Prabhu. Did you notice? Not a single CCTV camera. But we have a 50 inch TV and an entire library in there. Come on! What you're about to do, is not just a favour. It's a service. Maybe you won't derive happiness out of it. But you will bring happiness to several families. What you need to do is... - Sir! I'll take care of it. And you... - I'm leaving! Go on! Doctor! I don't want any money. Prabhu, the clients are anyway paying me for it. How could I keep it all? Just take the advance. What? This is just the advance? Of course. You get juice and biscuits for merely donating your blood. You've donated your life here! This is just for the test sample. Once the reports are here, I'll show you a life you've never seen. Take it. Yes, Chinna? - Kanna... You had sent a test sample recently... who is this boy? Why, are there any problems? A problem, indeed. - Oh no! Not a problem for you, but for the country. If we have a few more people like him, no one can control our population! Praise the Lord! Through hook or crook, you somehow landed a royal gene! Good Lord! Tell me more. Looks like his sperm count will touch a 100 million. Wow! His motility rate is great too! Yay! How did you get hold of someone even big clinics struggle to find? "Hit the bull's eye!" "Hit the jackpot!" "It's a sweet deal!" "It's a done deal!" "Is it a fair game?" "Is it a foul game?" "How it's going to rain over me!" "Here's a kindly king - Who showers a cherished treasure." "Tirelessly he doles it out; With no hint of vanity." "Yeah, that's him!" "The Magnanimous One!" "The Magnanimous One!" "The Magnanimous One!" "The Magnanimous One!" "This rotating earth... It seems to revolve around you." "Even when you shoot in the dark, It seems to find it's mark." "The grace of the God of Riches, It seems to tread in your footsteps." "All that you thought was spent, It seems to have been an investment." "What's new will become old, It seems you're ageing backward." "At your beck and call, The world's population shall rise and fall." "It's no magic; It's not tragic." "No magic, no wizardry, no love, no lust; No wife either, to claim her part." "You go, man!" "Here's a kindly king - Who showers a cherished treasure." "Tirelessly he doles it out; With no hint of vanity." "Yeah, that's him!" "The Magnanimous One!" "The Magnanimous One!" "The Magnanimous One!" "The Magnanimous One!" "Hit the bull's eye!" "Hit the jackpot!" "It's a sweet deal!" "It's a done deal!" I don't know why, but I really enjoy closing you out! I've known that for 25 years now. It's not like you would stop if you found your reason. Vanathi... you deserve credit for one thing though! As a single parent, you raised a son and ran a business. Just wow! Okay, okay, okay! I'll drop a good card for you. But... who selected you? Me! I knew that was coming. Ma'am, the girl who gets married into your family... Can you get the phone? Parambariyam. Good evening. Hello? This is Nidhi. A delivery is due tomorrow. Send it through Prabhu. Just a reminder. - Fine! Anything else? Who does everyone think I am? Where are you going? Are you mad? Who does she think she is? "Send it through Prabhu!" Who? The one who came the other day... Eyebrows. Nidhi had called? What did she say? The eyebrows girl is way out of your league. Choose someone who loves you instead of someone you love. That's best for you. I agree. Let me call up Sathish. You say "okay" to him. He loves you. He is the right man for you. He will serenade you with a song. You'll talk to him? Talk to him! Did Nidhi say when she'd be coming? 1 o clock? Okay. I heard you had called? Did you miss me? Yes, Prabhu. So much. Even now, I'm looking at your photo on my computer. Let me see. Okay, follow me. I have something for you. I've got you something. Go in and try it on. What's this for? Just try it on. I'll tell you. Prabhu, any plans for the evening? I have a doctor's appointment. Doctor? Are you okay? Why do you ask? Well, I thought if you are free... Nidhi? You don't have to hesitate. Just ask me! Tell me where you want to go. Let's go. I need to go to a wedding. Okay... It will be nice if you accompany me. Sure. Let's go. Please. So, who is getting married? A family friend's daughter. No one from your family is attending this wedding? My dad is in Coorg. And my aunt doesn't like attending these social gatherings. Hi, Nidhi! Okay, can you wait for 5 minutes? I just have to go show face. - Sure, no problem. I'd have been surprised if you wanted me to come. But we've made progress... So, Nidhi... What plans after this? Nothing! Just home. Okay... It's just 8pm... Can we go somewhere? Prabhu... Thank you so much for coming with me. But... this is not a date. I had to attend this wedding. But if I had come alone, they would've asked me why I'm still single. Don't even get me started on the unsolicited approaches... you know how it is. But if I have a man by my side, they will make assumptions and let me be. I get it. Sorry, please don't think I used you. Not at all! It's okay. Why are you smiling? You said two great things. One - you feel safe with me. Two - you are single. Prabhu... I'm alright. No, I meant... Seriously, it's okay! Let's get going. What do you expect from me, Prabhu? The way you look at me... you give me so much attention. What do you want from me? I didn't expect you to ask me this, so I don't know what to say. There is so much. No matter how hard I fall in life... I know some people will always hold my hand... like my mother, grandma, friends, coach... But after I met you, I feel like... there is a sky up there. Just surviving isn't enough. I wish to fly high. Oh, wow. You brought out the poet in me! But what I mean is... I am a divorcee. It's been 2 years now. He was a family friend. We fell in love and we got married. We had planned out our entire lives. But life doesn't happen the way we want it to. Yeah... I wanted to have a baby. But he felt his career was more important to him. I understood that... You know, hoping that one day, we will start a family. But that day never came. Later, I realized... he was having an affair with a woman. That crushed me, Prabhu. I know how marriages are. So many challenges. Good stuff, bad stuff... I can deal with that. But, this... I thought you should know all this. If this is a problem for you... I totally understand. Prabhu... She told you everything about her life. This is your best chance! Just fall at her feet... and tell her the truth. I'm a sperm donor. I'm a sperm donor. I'm a sperm donor! Just tell her. Come on. "Will you spend your life with me? Will you become one with me?" "When I'm in your arms, I come alive, I transform." "Will you spend your life with me? Will you become one with me?" "When I'm in your arms, I come alive, I transform." "My Isle of Love... Don't you ever leave." "I've come here for you... Just to love you." "When you look into my eyes... I die a little bit inside." "You make me forget... How to walk in the ground." "This is a kind of war; I've had a change of heart." "Every cell in my body utters your name; What's this trick, my dame?" "My days are filled with misty dreams; As I endure lonely nights." "My soul has waged a war against me; Is this fair, my dear?" "Don't go living your life... All by yourself." "Seeking asylum... Here I come." "Sometimes I stutter and fumble for words; Sometimes I stumble hearing your voice." "Truth, or lies... I can speak it all with ease." "When you smile, It's only warmth, there's no guile." "In a blade of grass; We lived apart as two dew drops." "Now, we flow seamlessly; Together, in an endless stream." "There is no love in the world; Without a shred of falsehood." "There is no perpetuity; In a love without adversity." "This is a kind of war; I've had a change of heart." "Every cell in my body utters your name; What's this trick, my dame?" "My days are filled with misty dreams; As I endure lonely nights." "My soul has waged a war against me; Is this fair, my dear?" He never answers calls... but his phone is busy all night. Something seems wrong, Kamu. Correct, Doctor. I too think he works at a call centre. What idiotic person told you that's what I was thinking? Do you think he is in love with someone? No, I fear that someone will fall in love with him. Dad, what's that? "My Isle of Love... Don't you ever leave." "I've come here for you... Just to love you." "When you look into my eyes... I die a little bit inside." "You make me forget... How to walk in the ground." "Will you spend your life with me? Will you become one with me?" "When I'm in your arms, I come alive, I transform." "Will you spend your life with me? Will you become one with me?" "When I'm in your arms, I come alive, I transform." "My Isle of Love!" "My Isle of Love!" "My Isle of Love!" "My Isle of Love!" What do you want? I have a lot of work. Get going. Why are you avoiding me? Everyone's wondering if we have broken up. Broken up? When were we ever in a relationship? Kalpana, we have been friends since childhood. Just friends. Don't do something stupid and ruin what we have. Get going. Oh! Is that so? I get it. It's the 'eyebrows girl', right? This won't last when she knows the truth about you. I'll tell her about the doctor. What doctor? You have a problem down there. Isn't that what the treatment is for? Treatment? I know everything. Laugh! Laugh all you want. Let's see what happens when I tell everyone. Go and announce it on a loudspeaker! Get out of my car now. Leave! Prabhu, where did you disappear? You never answer my calls! Do you know how many patients' appointments had to be cancelled? You need to supply regularly for me to apply! What can I do if you don't reply? Look, Prabhu... have I ever treated you unfairly? I'm in love with a woman. I knew it! I am going to marry her. I never saw this coming! When you are in love, only the quantity drops a little. But when you get married, the quality drops completely! Married life is so stressful. Married men are poor souls! The value of a bachelor's... - Sperm, sperm, sperm! Don't you know anything other than that? There are more important things in life. It's not that... - You only look at me as a machine? You understand your patients' feelings. All I'm asking is, show me some understanding too. I am crazy in love with her. To fall in love is a crazy thing in itself. Was that retort really necessary? I wish to live a beautiful life with her. I want to settle down. I need to concentrate on getting that job through sports quota. I can get married only after I get a job. Oh? How long can I continue doing this behind Nidhi's back? So...? Please look for another donor. That's best for both of us. Doctor... I'll see you. Mr. Panneerselvam? The application of the sports quota boy is being handled by you, right? Is the shredding machine in your office in working condition? Then get it done. Please don't consider this to be blackmail. Thank you. "Make a list of all your problems; You'll find a human is the root cause." "Think of the possible solutions; That human also holds the answers." "It's a human, yeah, it's the human; That human gave you this life." "It's a human, yeah, it's the human; It's that human who's giving you hell." Doctor, you studied FRCS in London and you're carrying around vegetables now! Aren't you ashamed? The client is a big shot. No one can know I'm a fertility doctor. So we have to be discreet! - Hello, you are...? - Vanangamudi, the minister's PA. - I am Dr. Kannadasan. - Shh! Doctor, do you have kids? My clinic is my baby, sir. Just answer my question! My astrologer told me my Jupiter won't align if I bend over. What does that mean? - I won't have marital bliss. He said it's better for me to stay unmarried. So I did just that. - I've been married for 8 years now. - Oh dear! But his wife has been married for 9 years now! Didn't you acquire her from the Counsellor...? By that logic, it's been 9 years, yes! Good for you. I've made a lot of money in this business. All I need now is an heir. - Politics is a business for you? - Come again? Your wish will come true. Trust in Kannadasan, and you shall never be let down! - You talk very well. - You're better. I'm going to take up a new posting in the assembly in three months' time. Before which, our madam must be two months late. When I take up that post, I want pride in my face. The pride of becoming a father. Definitely, sir. It will be all over your face. - Bharathidasan... - It's Kannadasan, sir. Kannadasan, who is the father of the baby? Sir, you don't have to worry about it! No one will know who the donor is. It's a secret. Shut up! He is just joking, sir. You are the father of the baby. Let it remain that way till the end! Till the end, sir. Or your baby will be gone. I meant your clinic! - What else will be gone? - His breath. Oh, right! Your breath. Get to work soon. Going for an interview? The employment exchange is giving me a hard time. It's too much. Faster! Coach, you said you knew someone... can you please find out my application status? Umar... - Hi, dude. - There is another way... Come, let's go right away. Hi Varsha. - Hi! - Is Shankar here? - He is inside. Hi, Manoj! Give me that... Stay right here. - Shankar? - Morning. Come in. Oh wow! What a view. The application is not here. Who is the candidate? Really? He's out there. - Hi! - Hi... - I'm going to be joining work here. - Oh, okay. - Thank you, sir. - Okay. Prabhu... - Mount Road is something else! - Prabhu. Day dreaming, huh? I was just looking out the window. The application isn't here yet. What? It must be stuck somewhere at the employment exchange... Coach, I've already applied thrice. Why hasn't it reached yet? How can I face him without a job? Face who? What! He is a Tamilian? Yes Dad, his family is from Tanjore. What business does he do? He doesn't do business. Are you telling me you are going to settle down with a boy... who goes for a job? Yes, he is looking for one. We will get married after he gets a job. He is jobless too? Not jobless. He is a freelancer. You never told me he is unemployed. Can he atleast afford a chicken leg, which you love to eat? Dad, first of all, for the both of us put together, I can afford a full Tandoori chicken everyday, life long. But even if I offer to buy, he won't agree to it. Prabhu is a vegetarian. What? He is a vegetarian? What, his whole family is vegetarian? I don't like this at all! Oh my God. You could polish off a full plate of pork chops... When you were just 3! Take it from me, my dear. He won't allow you to eat even eggs after marriage. With that, your identity would be lost too. First of all, Prabhu is not a psycho. He wishes for me to be myself. Moreover, even if I have to change... he will be worth it. Most importantly, he would never lie to me. He'd never ever put me through pain. I've seen it in his eyes. Does his family know you are a divorcee? A divorcee? You are my only son! What is wrong with you that you have to settle for a divorced woman? - It's love! What else? - Grandma! If she were from some other place, or from some other religion... I would have agreed immediately! I would have arranged the wedding myself! Is that all? She is from Karnataka! Are you doing this just to irritate me? Answer me! She won't give me any water even if I were dying from hiccups. When I want to have spicy sambar, she'd make it as sweet as dessert! She isn't the type of girl who makes sambar. She would think you're talking about the sambar deer. She is a meat eater. Look... just forget about marrying her. Or forget about me. This is just drama. All mothers throw a fuss initially. They will eventually come around. Talk to Nidhi'sparents and ask them to come here. Let's talk it out. Boy... I'm on it. That's better! What is he saying? He says, "Why are you here? How are the wedding preparations coming along?" Yeah, right. Her family refuses to come home to meet my family. Same problem with my family. If I could talk like you, I'd be married by now. Fine, what do you want now? It's about the job. You said... Phew! Continue. Doctor, you know Mr. Paneerselvam at the employment exchange office. My file hasn't moved at all. Can you talk to him and find out the status of my application? Why would your file still be there? Didn't we order it to be shredded to pieces and trashed? And now he's asking us about it? Just make up something and send him away. That's what the doctor said. Oh dear, such a fail tik-tok performance. You'd do anything for your selfish gains? How could you screw me over my job? I knew you had no morals... but I didn't expect you'd stoop this low. Why do you even bother praying? At one point in time, I used to look up to you as a father. You have screwed me over. I didn't want this job just to get married... A job at big company. A corner office at the top floor... with a view of Mount Road. Men like you will never get it! Like a madman, I came down here asking for your help. I'm to be blamed. Don't ever try to see me again. Doctor... Why did you spill the beans? Why shouldn't I beat your face into pulp, and disfigure that bulbous nose of yours? Doctor, it's already disfigured! Go and do something useful. Go on! Prabhu, get out! Yes, Nidhi? Why didn't you tell me your family friend is coming? What are you saying? A family friend? Who? People may beg to differ, but my favourite side dish is... pickle! Same pinch! - That's my favourite, too. - Seriously? Hey, Prabhu! Come and join us. I was just telling them about your job. What are you doing here? Take a seat, son. Thank you. He found the perfect job. Top floor, a corner office. With a view of the Mount Road. He got the job solely based on the merit of his footballing achievements. He is pure gold. How many carats, Prabhu? What was that, sir! You have a great sense of humour! Your hometown, Coorg, is famous for coffee, right? Absolutely! How about a cup of coffee? Nidhi, why don't you get him some coffee? Yeah! - Without sugar for me. - Without sugar for me. Perfect sync! Same taste. Both of you seem to have a lot in common! You can't build such a big house by making a honest living! Okay. Bye, Nidhi. Wait a moment. Don't rip me apart already. No stress, no stress! I've really secured that job for you. - Top floor? - Yes! - A corner office? - Yes! - View of the Mount Road? - Yes! Yes! Man, how did you? I meant, Doctor. I just blackmailed some important clients to secure that job for you. You are a natural at that... but why now? You yelled at me so badly. I'm not such a bad person. But then again... I'm not going to get you a job and fix your marriage for nothing. I'm not such a good person, either! I know that. Why am I doing you such a big favour? I'll tell you when the time is right. Meanwhile, you should book a marriage hall right away. Because it's easy to find brides and grooms these days. The hard part is finding marriage halls. Get to work! I trust that Prabhu told you Nidhi is a divorcee. As long as Prabhu doesn't have a problem, his decision is our decision. Why don't you come this side, dear? Oh, yeah... These days, we have become... really progressive. Sit down, dear. Even twenty five years back, I asked her to get remarried. But you don't have to worry about that now! Hereon, Nidhi is a Tamil girl, part of our family. And your husband...? I never got married. It won't work out for me. Oh, no. You shouldn't be so negative about yourself. There are matrimony websites catering to all age groups. You've never tried them? For the wedding... we will bring the best vegetarian caterers from here. It will be different! Prabhu loves the food too. What? Vegetarian food? Pure vegetarian, for both days. Great! Then how will the guests enjoy their liquor? Liquor? What is he saying? He means drinks. Booze. Actually, we have rituals in our weddings. So liquor is not allowed. Madam, we can't agree to that. - It doesn't work that way. - It is our wedding... We must serve pork! How is that even possible? You don't seem to get it. It might be happening in your town... but we need to follow our traditions. "Here comes the groom, to tie the knot; Here comes the bride, dressed all in light." "Don't waste any more time on negotiation; This boy is gold, he's your best option." "Who, oh, who is this gentleman? He's the magnanimous one!" "He is, he is, the ultimate giver; He's the magnanimous one." "Who, oh, who is this gentleman? He's the magnanimous one!" "He is, he is, the ultimate giver; He's the magnanimous one." "Here comes the groom, to tie the knot; Here comes the bride, dressed all in light." "Hey there, beautiful! Want to be wooed? Get over here, together we'll be good." "I'm up for the challenge, you vs me; Take my hand and we'll find out." "You're one, I'm two, you're three, I'm four; That's the deal, and we're cool forever." "Our wedding day is filled with happiness; Carry this feeling for the rest of our lives." "This is our time to groove; She's the one I'll love." "Who, oh, who is this gentleman? He's the magnanimous one!" "He is, he is, the ultimate giver; He's the magnanimous one." "Who, oh, who is this gentleman? He's the magnanimous one!" "He is, he is, the ultimate giver; He's the magnanimous one." "Here comes the groom, to tie the knot; Here comes the bride, dressed all in light." "Who, oh, who is this gentleman? He's the magnanimous one!" "He is, he is, the ultimate giver; He's the magnanimous one." "Who, oh, who is this gentleman? He's the magnanimous one!" "He is, he is, the ultimate giver; He's the magnanimous one." - It's vegetarian, right? - Don't worry, madam. I've instructed them to serve only pure vegetarian to Grandma and you. - Thank you. - Cheers! Prabhu, I hope this house is okay for you. I've got some of my stuff packed in the guest bedroom. - I'll clear it out by this weekend. - No problem at all, Uncle. This is comfortable enough. All good! Okay. Let me get the door, Uncle. Help yourself. Doctor? How come you're here? Prabhu, who is it? Dr. Kannadasan, Prasad! Invite him in. Let's all eat. Please come in. Please come with me for a moment. I need to discuss something with you. You do know of this thing called phone, right? You do know you can't send that thing over phone, right? Why are you doing this? Hello! - Hi, sir. How are you? - I'm doing really well! Nidhi! You have become so beautiful after marriage. [singing old Tamil song] I'll leave you two. - Join us for lunch. - Go ahead, I'll join you. What do you want? A job you could have never got by yourself... Top floor. Corner office. A view of the Mount Road! Plus a marriage with the girl you loved. I think I'm truly selfless. You've come for payback? Not at all! You said I was like a father to you! Please don't think I'm blackmailing you. Think of it as repaying a favour to someone who helped you. - I'm going on my honeymoon tomorrow. - That's only tomorrow! Today, you make some lonely moon! One last time. Please! Hi, Prasad. Hi, Vanathi! - Welcome, everything is ready. - Serve me some pudding! Tell him that all scores have been settled. Don't ever think about coming back again. Leave now! Happy married life, Prabhu. Enjoy! "Shall we look at the rainbow?" Someone wanted directions. Let's get going. "The moon smiles at us kindly; Let's trap us some honey?" "My days of being alone, Thanks to you, are all done." "You're here by my side; You're all mine." "I couldn't ask for more!" "There's a shift in the winds; There's a gentle drizzle in parched lands." "All of my dreams have come true..." I can hardly believe it. Believe what? Everything. It feels like I got everything I wished for in life. Feels like? I have actually got it all. I got you. Really? And you? Answer me! Ask me anything. I want to have a baby. "There's a shift in the winds; There's a gentle drizzle in parched lands." "All of my dreams have come true; It's all come together." "Woman, because of you, Everything looks beautiful.' "It's all crystal clear." "Woman, when our bodies touch; I know there will be fireworks." "Yeah, everything's on fire!" Doctor, I clearly told him the other day. One moment. Look inside. Doctor, that's a lot of money! The last donation you made before your honeymoon... it was for a political bigshot... Thanks to you, he is a father today. He gave a lot of money to celebrate his happiness. Take it. It will help you in the future. I clearly told you the other day, I don't want anything to do with this. Things have finally fallen in place in my life. I want to lead an honest life. Goodbye. "All of my dreams gave come true; It's all come together." "Woman, because of you, Everything looks beautiful." "It's all crystal clear.' "Woman, when our bodies touch; I know there will be fireworks.' "Yeah, everything's on fire!' "Come on, dear! Lean on me; Shall we look at the rainbow?' "The moon smiles at us kindly; Let's trap us some honey?' Your wife has a problem with her uterus. She also has tubal blockage. What happened, Nidhi? She cannot conceive a baby naturally. Any other methods or treatment? I understand your situation, Mr. Prabhu. But some people don't have bodies that are capable of bearing children. I don't want to give you any false hopes. This is a really tough time for Nidhi. Not just physically, but also mentally. What she really needs right now is your love and support. [Speaking Kannada] Oh God, why should such things happen only to us? We never wronged anybody. Why is this happening to us? What if Prabhu'sfamily abandons her now? Prasad, that's not the problem now. We should only be worrying about howNidhi is going to cope with this problem. I am worried! But you know what I mean. How is Nidhi doing? Must I repeat what the other doctors said? I feel bad. The possibility of Nidhi bearing a child... I'm sorry, Prabhu. Really sorry. This is so unfair, sir. This is the one thing Nidhi wished for. She has never asked me for anything else. When I watch her suffer... I feel so guilty. She doesn't deserve this. I understand, Prabhu. I've been dealing with so many patients who have the same problem. But when it happens to someone close to us, it feels so different. Okay, Prabhu! All this while, I've only been your business partner. From now, I'll be your Doctor. Listen carefully. Similar to how men have methods such as artificial insemination... women have some options too. Surrogacy. Surrogacy isn't too complicated. A surrogate mother will bear your child in her womb. After the child is delivered, they will part ways. They will have nothing to do with you or the child. No, Doctor. This won't work out. I want to adopt a child. Adoption? When did you decide this? Just now. This isn't something you decide on an impulse! Doctor, we had decided long back that we want to have a child. No one expected things to turn out this way. By adopting a child... it will be a new start for both of us. It's been days since I saw Nidhi smile. I feel like this is the right decision. Prabhu... This is a good decision. You are mature enough to have thought it through. But Vanathi isn't mature enough to accept the decision. You go ahead. I'll handle things here. I can't keep changing, unlike your Grandma. If I had done that, we wouldn't have had this comfortable life. How much more should I change? Mom, I'm not asking you to change. Nidhi is broken too. I just want you to trust us on this decision. Time will show you it was the right decision. Till that happens, just let me be. Hello, welcome. Dr. Kannadasan has told me a lot about you. Kavya has been here for 8 months now. She was living a comfortable life. In a flash of a second, her life was wrecked. A gory accident. Her parents died on the spot. She got away with minor injuries. No one in her family wanted to take the responsibility of raising her... So they put her in this orphanage. The fact that you came here for her... is God's boon to her. Are you ready to meet her? Nidhi! Sorry, ma'am. One second. Nidhi... Are you mad? Why would you walk out on her? That poor little girl. Sorry, Prabhu. Nidhi... What happened? For a moment, I didn't know what was happening. I'm scared. To get over this fear, every mother gets 10 whole months. But I only had 10 minutes... I understand. Look. Look at me. Trust me. Everything you wished for is within arm's reach. This is a road less travelled. But this path, too, leads to the same destination. We are sending Kavya with you on pre-adoptive foster care. This is like a trial period. This is a crucial period which will decide whether you and Kavya are getting along. We will start the adoption formalities only after that. All the best. I believe in you. You will take good care of her. Kavya, please forgive me. In some matters, I, too, am a child like you. That's why I ran and hid today, instead of facing you. I can see it. My life is going to change. For good. I look forward to it. To get to know more about you. What you like. What you dislike. I don't know who your parents were. Nor do I know how they wished to raise you. Nor do I know if we can do the same for you. But I will keep you safe. Promise. "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" Good night. Kannadasan! "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" "Trap-trap-trap... He's trapped! The ro-ro-royal prince is trapped!" Hello? Hello, Doctor? Can you hear me? Doctor, can you hear me? Look who is here! - No! - Eat a little atleast. I said some wrong things in a fit of rage. I didn't stop to think how you must have felt. I'm really sorry. It's okay, Mom. Here it Peanut candy. We were all confused. I understand. I've made pudding. Let me know how it is? Look there! Peanut candy. I'm coming, baby. Here, hold this. I'm coming! Who is this? Grandma! Where did you disappear? She loves peanut candy, too. When I saw here today, I showered her with affection! Wholeheartedly! Mom... Tell me you've forgiven me. Say it. Somehow... when I see her, it feels like she is actually family. She is really your daughter! My grand-daughter! Did you notice something? Her eyes look identical to yours. Grandma! My grand-daughter is calling for me. I need to go. Bye! - Grandma! - I'm coming, little one. Where have you disappeared! Kannadasan, you fraud! They've asked me to report to work from tomorrow. There is a lot of work to be done. Why, what happened? Pressure from the Head Office. There is an important commitment. Only I can do it. So please take care of her when I'm not around. Kavya... You will, right? Yeah, I will. One... Two... Three... Kavya, I'm going to open my eyes. Where are you? - Hello? - Hello! Hello? - Prabhu... Dr. Kannadasan speaking. Can you hear me? Hello? This is Doctor Kannadasan here. I came to Kedarnath on a pilgrimage... The signal is very poor here. Where did you disappear? I've been trying to reach you for 2 days. I just told you the signal is poor! What's the tearing hurry? Is Kayva my child? Well... Tell me the truth! It is... She isn't your child... But she was born through your donation. How did you get to know? Oh no! Why didn't you tell me? How can you be so callous about something so huge? You thought I'd never find out? Oh no, Prabhu... Please listen to me patiently. First of all, you should have never known anything about this. It's not too late. Only the two of us know about it. No one else will ever get to know. So...? You want me to live my entire life hiding the truth? No one even knows I'm a donor. A child born through my donation has ended up at my home! Why do you do this? Prabhu, let me say it one last time... You weren't Kavya'sfather till yesterday. You were just a donor. But now, Kavya is a new addition to your and Nidhi's family. Do you remember, the MLA had given you a lot of money? You refused it. But I went ahead and invested it in real estate and stocks. All for your future. You have been blessed with a good family now. Your own daughter has come back to you. Don't lose her. Kavya? Kavya! I visited a lot of orphanages to help you out. Kavya! That's when I found out the truth about Kavya. I am a spiritual person. I believe there exists a supreme power above all of us. Just think about it... Why should Nidhi have such a condition? Why should you come to me and talk about adopting a child? Why should I run into Kavya when I went to the orphanage? Kavya, your own daughter. You have a nice family now. You got back your own daughter. Don't let go of her. He is alive! Let's go. He's a lucky guy. He could have easily been swept into the ocean. "Is this a new chapter unfolding in my life?" "Is this the monsoon to my drought?" "Stealing my heart, healing my hurt; You came as the ray of hope." "Speaking words, working your magic; You gave my life logic." "With every wave of your hands; You paint a masterpiece in thin air." "With every doodle on the wall; You write the most beautiful poetry." "The moment I bear you; My burdens are no more." "The desire to live tomorrow; With each passing day, seems to grow." "No matter who you are; You're the one I love, you are!" "To be your mother; My wife is here forever." "Breathing life into my house; You have given a home." "Peer into my eyes, and you will see; The unbridled joy, you have given me." "May these days last forever, and forever!" "Oh, this is everything... it's enough!" "May these days last forever, and forever!" "Oh, this is everything... it's enough!" "Is this a new chapter unfolding in my life?" Little one, I've got a surprise for you! Come! You must wear this all the time! Never take it off, okay? A kiss for me? Thank you! I believe the precious little girl has a good life ahead of her. If you are ready to adopt Kavyawe can get the formalities started. You are ready, right? Yes, absolutely. Mr. PrabhuGovind? Yeah? Land shares in Injambakkam. Stock shares in big companies. And other investments. I could go on! But I have nothing to say about his income sources. A normal job with a monthly salary. Moreover, if you look into his account details before he got a job... that's another long list. No, sir. He actually worked as a personal trainer for a lot of high profile clients. Stop joking, madam! There is no evidence of him having worked as a personal trainer. You look like an educated person. You should know better. Anything and everything is dealt with papers these days. Show me if you have any relevant papers. If you don't, please stop wasting our time. Just as you requested... Dr. Kannadasan is on his way here. Nidhi, this isn't as bad as you think it is. Once the doctor gets here, I'll explain everything. You should leave now. Be with Kavya. She must be scared. Answer me, Prabhu... Why am I here? Why don't I have the answers to any of the questions the police asked me? Don't hide anything from me. I told you several times! Why are we here? Like this? I don't know how to say it. Once you decide to speak up the truth... everything else will fall in place. Some time back... I was a... I was a sperm donor. What? They were looking for a healthy donor for artificial insemination. The doctor approached me. You are a sperm donor? Nidhi, initially I felt it was wrong too. But when I saw the reality around me... when I saw the pain people went through because of childlessness... So, this was your "personal training"? God! I've been such a fool. - Nidhi... - So, all this money you earned... Nidhi, I refused the money. But the doctor forced me to take it... Disgusting, Prabhu. Did you do it after our wedding? No... The moment we decided to get married, I gave it all up. But, one time... The doctor said it was an emergency, so I helped him. - I swear I didn't do it again. - Don't touch me, Prabhu. Why, Prabhu? Why didn't you tell me earlier? You had so many opportunities. You could have told me when I told you I was a divorcee. You could have told me when we decided to get married in Coorg. Most importantly, It didn't even occur to you to tell me when we found out I can't bear a child. Because you already have children. Nidhi, those aren't my children. I only donated to Dr. Kannadasan. You keep bringing up his name - Dr. Kannadasan... Who is he to you? You would do anything he tells you? - It may seem wrong at first glance... - Just stop it, Prabhu. Hearing all this, my mind is wandering... Prabhu... Kavya came into our life through Dr. Kannadasan. We didn't go around and stumble into Kavya. From what you say... Kavya...? I was going to... about to... tell you. Nidhi... Nidhi, please. Nidhi? Nidhi... I'm sorry. You could be the reason Kavya was born into this world. I understand what you are going through. I am not upset with you. But in the current situation... I don't think it's right for Kavya to come home with you. Please understand. What happened to Kavya? They've taken my child away from me. You are the reason for that too. Nidhi, what... What happened to Kavya ? You want to know why? Shall I tell you? Why don't you find out from Dr. Kannadasan! Nidhi... This is nothing. I'll handle this. Think about it, sir... None of the families even know him, or what he looks like. But they just wish to repay their gratitude in the form of money or gifts. You don't need to tell me how that works! But sir, this is completely legal. The big shots don't want their names to come out. So, we are doing this discreetly. But the thing is... sperm donation is a certified legal treatment in our country. Does such a business exist? It hardly sounds believable! Sir, you can look it up on Google. It's all out there. Look it up on Google? But I need an Apple laptop for that. 15 inches. 15 inches? Sir, I'll sort this out for you with a 6 inch Apple. One moment. Why did I bother putting my son in an engineering college? - Kannadasan? - Sir, is that you? - Are you well? - Somewhat, sir. Sir, an Inspector insists on knowing the identity of your child's father. I refused to answer. Now he is threatening me to buy a laptop for him. Pass the phone to him. Sir, you said it was a secret. Forget the secret. Pass the phone to him! Yes, sir. Sir, he is here. Here, sir. You'll be getting an Apple TV delivered from Amazon. Hello? Sir! Yes, sir? Yes, sir! As you say, sir. I will release him. Prabhu... Prabhu, stop! What happened was unfortunate. I'm sorry. Let me go. It's all over. Can I have a minute? Please! "The scattering of clouds.." "..won’t disturb the sky" "Even if the thoughts.." It will distress Kavya if you were to meet her at this stage. Moreover, I cannot send Kavya if your wife isn't living with you. First, get your life sorted, Mr. Prabhu. Should I be happy that a lot of couples were blessed with children because of you? Or should I feel sad that you have betrayed all of us? I don't know. "Wounds tend to heal" Hello, Nidhi? How are you? What do you want? Please, Nidhi! Everything has come to a standstill without you. Come back. If not for me, atleast for Kavya's sake. Hey... Nidhi? What is it, dear? "Tell me... Why do you hesitate, dear?" "I've seen the wrong in my ways; O Breath of my Life!" "Can I take another heartbreak?" Answer the phone, Nidhi. "Could I take it?" "And while we are looking for the path..." "Could our choices change?" "And while we are looking for answers..." Mom... Prabhu... What sort of a human are you? Aren't you ashamed? Madam? Don't say anything! A man your age... you have exploited my son so badly! You are shameless enough to call him again? Madam, it is... Don't say anything! I run my own business too. But, I'm Prabhu's mother first. Even though you are a doctor, Prabhu was just business to you. - Madam, well... - Don't say anything. We invited you into our family because we trusted you. And now... my family is broken. - I can explain, madam. - Don't say anything! If you ever come near Prabhu or my family again... that would be it! You've caused so much damage! So much! I've toyed around with Prabhu'slife to suit my needs, and screwed up big time. Yes, Doctor. Every single word his mother told me over the phone is etched into my heart. That poor lady had to suffer a lot of pain. She must be great. Yes, Doctor. I used him and settled down with a nice car and house... but his family is broken now. I am a terrible person. Yes, Doctor. Doctor, it's closing time. Let's leave? You get going. I've got some thinking to do. Good night, Doctor. "Noble men seldom sleep" "It’s the order of the day Says Poet Kannadasan" - Hello, Prabhu. - You wanted to see me, Coach? I just wanted to talk. - I'll see you later. - Prabhu... Don't let your anger and frustration blind you. He says it's important. Why don't you atleast hear him out? - But... - Hear him out atleast for my sake! Come. Make it quick. What do you want? Prabhu... I promise you. What I'm going to say now is not for my selfish gains. Believe me. Though I have been a cunning businessman, I made my money by making families happy. But when I see your family is broken because of me... I can't even sleep peacefully. I want to fix the damage I've caused. I'm only asking you for an opportunity. That's all! Please. You two aren't the only ones going to be affected by your separation. It's two families. More importantly... that poor innocent child. And it's your child, Prabhu. Anger serves no purpose. [speaking Kannada] Stay calm. Please. Welcome, Prabhu. Have a seat. Go in and talk. We will be around if you need something. You shouldn't have come here. I'm not ready to talk to you. Please don't force me. I understand, Nidhi. But I didn't know another way. I didn't come here to justify myself, or force you into anything. What I did was wrong. I should have told you I was a donor before our wedding. But I couldn't muster the courage, Nidhi. When I got to know we can't have a child... I got really scared. I worried that you'd feel bad if you found out the truth. But... after I learned the truth about Kavya... my world was turned upside down. Kavya and you mean the world to me, Nidhi. I need the both of you. I know I really hurt you. All I'm asking for is one chance. That's all. Just come with me to this place for a day. Then I'll accept any decision you make. Don't watch too much TV. - Correct? - Yes, sir. Park it at the back. Please be there, I'll meet you in sometime. Hi, Prabhu! Hi... Nidhi... Your anger, pain, frustration... I get everything. Just listen to me once! I didn't come here for this. Please hear me out patiently. Just five minutes. Just five minutes. Be with me. Please. This way, please. This way. Please! Come on. Listen, Nidhi... Prabhu's life had some unexpected twists. I'm the reason for that. Whether it's right or wrong... it depends on your perspective. As a doctor... and as a businessman... it felt right to me. But I can't say how you would feel about it, as his wife. But when you look at all these families and their children... what do you think? All of them look so content and happy. So complete. But look at me. All these parents came to me sometimeback feeling exactly this way. This same yearning. This same void. But that was only till Prabhu entered their lives. After he entered their lives, they only saw happiness. Just look at them for yourself. Take a look. Thanks to his donation... all these people here became parents. Doctor, all these children... are my...? All the children you see... were born because of you. Forty nine. - Forty nine? - Yes! "Here come the winds of change; Your eyes will see a brand new world." Can I meet them? Of course! "Even in battlegrounds, flowers will bloom." "Oodles of happiness... Will that do?" "No tricks, or traps... Will this last?" "How I long for an embrace... Will I ever tire of it?" "Love is endless... Will we ever need it to end?" "May the dark clouds; Rain on these parched grounds." "May your forgotten sorrow; Make way for tomorrow." "Whose handiwork is this; The sweet babble of kids?" "Who's to say; Happiness can be found this way?" "Sweet and sour, We'll share it all." "You and I, We'll birth smiles." "Come, soak in this beauty; Drench in this purity." "Come, master this simplicity; And grow into a child." "Come, soak in this beauty; Drench in this purity." "Come, master this simplicity; And grow into a child." "Come to me, dear..." "You tender child!" "It's monsoon in my heart..." "And I'm drenched!" "Sweet and sour, We'll share it all." "You and I, We'll birth smiles." "Even when words cause sorrow; We'll heal it with the balm of love." "Even when we err; We'll erase it with our care." "I'll give you everything..." "My tender child!" "A better world for you..." "I'll give it my everything!" "Sweet and sour, We'll share it all." "You and I, We'll birth smiles." "Here come the winds of change; Your eyes will see a brand new world." - Can I go to play? - Okay, go. Careful. So... school, tuitions, football coaching, music class, dance class, drawing class... and whatever she wishes... do you believe we can give her all of that? Why do you ask? Are you coming home with me? "Oodles of happiness... Will that do?" "No tricks, or traps... Will this last?" "How I long for an embrace... Will I ever tire of it?" "Love is endless... Will we ever need it to end?" 'Mind opens for Science,heart to adopt, eyes for the change - Krishna Marimuthu' "May the dark clouds; Rain on these parched grounds." "May your forgotten sorrow; Make way for tomorrow." Hello, sir. Hello, madam. Has your son started attending school? School? He is in politics! - Politics? - Yes, sir. - What does he do? - He works as Children's Secretary. "Come, soak in this beauty; Drench in this purity." "Come, master this simplicity; And grow into a child." "Come, soak in this beauty; Drench in this purity." "Come, master this simplicity; And grow into a child."
