So, it's true, they coming? Yes, they're here! So, no one to stop them? - Go on you! I did my duty. Where are they? - At 3 gunshots. - What will happen? - What always happens! After the Hulans, the battalion to take your provisions, then the army.. to empty your basement, your pantries, your safes. There! You saw? They arrived! - Thanks for the good news. Oh it's you, Henri? Well, come in. But you're injured? - No, but, I had a narrow escape. Dubreuil was shot. Simon was shot. Barbet was shot. We fell into an ambush. Can you lend me an old garment? If you had anything. An old garment, sure. Provided it fits. Where was this ambush? - At Ste Catherine. I thought I'd never make it up to here! - A little alcohol will revive you. So, at a time like this, you come here? Where else? - Well, to Jeanne. - She's good for love not for the trust. I'll get your clothes. - Oh, take this! Hide it well, huh? If the Prussians find it here,.. you won't be spared 12 shots! The price for hiding a sniper. Prussians here! Where you think you are? - They won't ask your opinion! Find me something good, huh? - Yes. Want a suit? Fernand left it here once when he was drunk. If not him, it was Edmond. By the way, what's become of him? You don't know? He's in the Loire Army with Chanzy.- No! Here, try it. Here they are. The swines! There! Rouen is taken! Oh, that makes me an odd effect. We are betrayed, there! Betrayed everywhere. But it's not over, huh? It's not over! If they come here and find you? - I don't care, but you. What can we do? Open! Searching! Little lady. No one? I won't stay a minute longer with those. - And where..? - Anywhere far from them. Well, now, to leave town... - Oh, I'll manage. Hear this all day long! Oh, no! You know me. I'd make a scandal or I'd fall ill. Well, I think I compromised you enough. - Won't you stay here? No, I'm tired. - Well, nothing fancy. Besides, today I don't feel like. Now I want to go see Cornudet, to know about the others. - Who is Cornudet? That big guy, who acts as Republican? - You know him? By sight, like anyone else. Lives far from here? - Well, 500 meters. At the Hotel Normandie. I'll see if you can get out. Although I don't deem it prudent. Henri, hurry up. There is no one. Good luck! - Goodbye. Come in! Hello! Who is it? Henri, old man, what's the matter? Such a worried face! My exhibition of Badinguet surprises you? Well, consider... Fr?d?ric Champ just cut in two the Loire Army. Chanzy is in trouble at Tours. Bourtaqui in trouble at Nevers. Faidherbe in trouble at La Fers. Garibaldi defeated at Dijon. Gambetta is at Bordeaux. In Paris besieged, Truche loses his head to pretend he has brains. Finally, since an hour, Prussians and Bavarians camp here, in Rouen. But it's the apotheosis of Badinguet! Long live Badinguet! Hello! So what's new? You had a hard blow at Ste Catherine? - We lost men. Three were shot. You know about the others? They crossed the Seine to reach Pont-Audemer with General Brigand. What do you advise? - Join them, and continue the fight. No major attacks, small raids. Harass, harass, harass! The watchword and the best tactic. - You'll stay here? - Not me. I do my trunks. - Where you going? To Le Havre. They need me there. - When you going? I don't know, I've just decided. In fact, I'll talk to Poidevin, must be in his office. Wait here. - Yes. Come in! Do you mind? - Not at all. - Oh, my compliments! Are they trophies? Hey, you got prisoners? - Don't say! We're no longer at our own home. Fortunately my wife is dead. She wouldn't lack worries! Historic days like this, I'd willingly do without! Give him... Oh, I don't know! - You seem overwhelmed! Oh, I will remember your war! Well, the 17, give him the 17. But he requires two rooms. - And where should I get them? If he's not happy, should return where he came from! Go! They think they're in a conquered country! Well, I leave tomorrow morning at 7:30. You can hold my seat? - Where? In your diligence! - There is no more! We're occupied, my friend! Yes, but I must absolutely leave. - Well, all travel is prohibited. Talk to the general. He just commandeered my first floor. Yes, well, I'm sorry, but I have no authority to solicit a tenant. Yes, that, my friend... Come in! Hello my friend! Sir. - Good morning Count! Well, my friend, what do you say of all this? Oh, if it was to get to this debacle.. that we so shamefully expelled King Louis-Philippe,.. February '48 costs us dearly! - Pardon? Nothing, sir. Nothing. From an hour, these gentlemen are lodged at my home. Very kindly, anyway. So I decided to temporarily abandon my dwelling to my guests,.. and go away for some time. Until the restoration of Duke d'Aumale, for example. Pardon? Nothing, citizen! I beg you to hold me two seats for tomorrow morning at 7:30. Count, it's impossible! It takes an authorization. I'm general councilor, just one word to the prefect. It doesn't depend on him, but on the Prussians! I'll see them gladly. We'll get along better, not speaking the same language! And if they refuse? -Why should they, since I want to leave! Come on in. Sir,... Well, hello Count! Well, sir, you remember our last conversation at the General Council? I told you so! Sooner or later we will pay the bill for '89. After Valmy, there is Waterloo. After Waterloo, Sedan. What a beautiful disaster! We asked for it, anyway! 40 years of romanticism, an unhealthy literature, a theater of decadence,.. no more was needed to cause this splendid catastrophe. It's obvious! Without Lamartine and Victor Hugo, we would have won the war! But, exactly. - Oh, come on! At this very moment, I had to lay off my staff. No! Your 3 spinning mills? - Closed! Fortunately, I saved for rainy days. From July 13, when I saw that the annuity dropped to 67 francs,.. I deposited some money through a stockbroker in London. I think it's wise to join it as soon as possible. Poidevin, hold me two seats for tomorrow morning. 1,000 regrets, dear M. Carr?-Lamadon. Can not leave town! But I must leave, I need to go! I will. Alas, sir! These are the orders of the occupant. They relate only to the populace, not us! My friend, you must get us out of here. We're councilors, the Count and me. We have responsibilities. To assume them, we must first put us out of reach of the enemy. Right! When they'll learn your political situation, you won't escape. Hostage! And, when you say hostage, you say bang-bang! No! You think so? Poidevin! You'll respond for our life before God, who will judge you! But dear sir, I've already said. Cannot leave town! You afraid? - Afraid! Not for me, but for my wife! Me, I've seen worse! I had two strikes! And your workers didn't massacre you? They weren't real strikes! Come in! Ah! Poidevin! Poidevin! Poidevin, my savior! Gentlemen, Count... What a day, huh? And they came anyway! Oh! I said to myself, they won't dare, huh! Not Rouen! The harbor, the cathedral! Joan of Arc! Well, they did dare. It's all fault of Charlemagne! If they had dismembered the empire of Charles V. Well, say, any doubt on what brings me? We need to leave Rouen, my wife and me, tomorrow at the latest. Watch out! Not there! Thank you. I...I'm so nervous that I no longer know what I do with my behind! Say, you still have two seats for me, yes? - No! - What? But, let me finish... - No, not you, not you, me! Put yourself in my place. The state owes me a lot, it commandeered all the wines I had in the cellar. Only at Havre I can recover my money. You may not go! The Prussians oppose it. But why? I did nothing. - But it's a general measure, my dear! More reason to do an exception for me! - Poidevin, frankly, for our passes.. how much? - It depends on the General! And they're expensive this year! At the exchange rate... I can give you money right away, in gold! - Me, too. At any rate, you cannot leave before 8 days. But the essential is to leave, so don't hesitate! Say a number. Yes, of course... I'm doing you a big service! Sure, sure, but make them a price. Service included! Thanks. - Goodbye, Loiseau. Bon voyage. - Thank you. You want my opinion? Well, they aren't there yet! If they ever get there at all... Snipers on one side, Prussians on the other... Well! They wanted to go, huh? Huh? You know her? - Who? - Her! Where? - Over there. So what? So, it's the Rousset girl, Boule de Suif. No! There's nothing to smile about. A prostitute! Oh, this war! What a war! Did you see? - What? - Over there. Well? - You don't recognize her? - Who? - But, her! Her! No! What cheek! Travelling with us, as an ordinary person! Did you see? - Who? - Did you see at my left? So? - You don't recall? - Who? - Her, Boule de Suif.- Is Boule de Suif? Why is she called Boule de Suif? She's not so big. She kept her nickname,.. but she lost her fat! A loose girl! Well, definitely we are losers. - Yes. Isn't it, Countess? - Pardon? - Have you seen? Where? - Over there, opposite. - Opposite? - Yes, you know her. Isn't the prostitute? - Yes, Countess. Unheard of! Quite the brazen face of women of ill repute. Dear? - On your left, you see? No, what? - Well, look, you'll realize! Is not that person who is called... - Exactly! Charming stay! Like being in a Republic! This type to my left. - Well? That's him. - Who? Oh good God. Gambetta, Rochefort, the mob rule! Ah, I pity you with all my heart! Between the girl and the Count... Yes, well? You know who is that individual? - No. - Cornudet. The democrat? - Yes. The advocate of mob rule. Edmond! - Huh? Next to the Rousset girl. Admirable! Revolution at shoulder to prostitution! What a great program! We are in a hellish diligence. - What? On our same rank! I know, I told you, the Rousset girl! - But there's worse! Impossible. - Well, see for yourself. - Oh, Cornudet! I don't care, I don't do politics, I trade. No good trade without good politics. Oh, you know, I sell wine. It's drunk to toast anyone. Be it king, emperor, republic, Bismarck, pope and mother in law! Have you noticed? At the end... Of course, I noticed! This is not a coach! It is a catch-all! When I think it took 8 days to get our passes. Well, I don't regret those 8 days. They allowed me to objectively observe our winners.. and revise the inconsiderate judgment that I bore on them. Part of my house was requisitioned by Colonel Baron Von Plattenburg,.. a delightful man, and of very nice relation. Well, after all,.. aristocracy is a small homeland itself, above the ordinary homelands. What separates me from the baron? Nothing! Finally, the language! But people of same wealth always understand each other very well. Interest is a feeling. Well, to be clear, I don't like Prussians, but I must admit,.. that there is more affinity between me and the Baron, for example,.. than between me and some individuals,.. whose behavior and opinions are a real attack.. on decorum. Very true! So I, when I listen to the arguments of some of my compatriots,.. I feel like abroad! Stop! You can not pass! What is it? - There is someone... Stop! So, we can not pass? No! Not by there. Make a detour. - Why? We're going to Cl?res. Well, take to the left, you will regain the road at 3 leagues. Is forbidden to go by there? We're going to attack a Prussian convoy! Come on, get away! Oh, that's great! Go on, giddy up! Oh, if this goes on, I unhitch. Well, good luck, guys! Oh, what a road! We are at the mercy of the whims of snipers and other idlers, my dear! Everyone does his own little war. The French lost the battle, but they won't admit it. The French, the French! So, you're Eskimo, you? Finally, if all goes well, with the detour,.. we will be at Cl?res around 2:00, and at Dieppe by 7:00 and 7:30. You yes, but not us. We're not going to Dieppe. - Come on! No, we get off on route. We'll forget this ridiculous and tragic time.. at Uville, in the castle of our cousin. And, if the castle is occupied? It is a work of art. They do not occupy a work of art! The Prussians, thank God, are cultured people. When they see this castle,.. that withstood the assault of seasons and centuries,.. they will bow, as only could do,.. the descendants of Frederick the Great, the literate Prince. Bravo, Von Eyrik! Well targeted! This deserves a drink. Have another glass of cognac with me. - Thank you much. They wrote you? - Yeah, yeah. My wife. It was her birthday. Ha ha! Send her this, on my part, with my respects. Donnerwetter! Are you bored? And you? No, me, I have the music. Me, I have the war! I'd like to be home, in Potsdam. I, I would like to be at our home. In Paris. What's up? The prisoners refuse to answer. - So? What time is it? Five minutes from 2:00. Five to two? Right? - Right. Perfect! Take these prisoners and shoot them at exactly 2 o'clock,.. and then report to me. Got it? Understood? - Yessir, Lieutenant! - At 2:00 exactly. Precisely! Enough! Excellent! - By God! Congratulations, Von Eyrik! Well done! With a damned precision! Thank you. Lieutenant? What? Karl, come. Bravo! Champagne, Karl? You've earned it. Gentlemen! To victory! Everything went well? - Yes, Lieutenant. There's no more prisoners? - One, Lieutenant. Sniper? - No, hostage. He holds an official function? - Nein. But he is father to five children. Just as well. We make five orphans with a single dead. A nice shot. Why are you laughing? I'm not kidding. Him again! Always him! Unpleasant. And treacherous! What is it now? - Nothing. My pet peeve, as the French say. We've requisitioned even the clock? - Requisitioned...sure! And tomorrow will be the other castles turn. - Yes, I guess so. You've done a great job. Colonel Folsborg! - Ober Folsborg, pastor. Not too upset? You won't leave me? - No, I won't leave you. Moreover, it is I who will speak. Trust me, huh? You trust me? No, no! No time! Sorry, I have no time for you. 5 minutes, sir. It's about a poor hostage. No, these things do not concern me. See Lt. d'Eyrik. He's the specialist of the matter. Lt. Von Eyrik is to receive the priest! - Yessir! - They'll announce you. By the way. And your bell tower? Still in the same state of resistance? But,.. I don't understand. - Sure! You are very intelligent. Before our arrival, you were doing Ding Dong Dong, every day. And ever since we're here, nothing. The silence. Your church has lost its voice. It is not nice, Mr. Cure. Not nice. Well, goodbye. And good luck! Lieutenant Von Eyrik will receive you. Go! Come on. Quickly! Oh, Mr. Cure! Madame. What can I do for you sir? The colonel assured me that I would find a good reception from you. Have no doubt, Mr. Cure, no doubt. I am, you know it, a man of good will. I am listening. I, sir, am a very unhappy old man. Not a day goes by that one of my parishioners.. isn't subjected to repressive measures. The French are not wise, sir. We must get tough, it's war! No doubt. But your justice has lost conscience. It strikes its victims recklessly. The Lord will repair my wrongs. He's here for this. One day you'll have to appear before Him,.. and maybe then you'll thank the Cure of Uville,.. who has enabled you to do good, and save your soul. Oh, Mr. Cure, you are a tempter angel! My soul is in danger and you want to aid it! A soul of Prussian! God only singles out the good from the bad. - Fine psychologist! Well then, sir, what penance are you going to impose me? Is it a penance to prevent a crime? A crime? And you didn't tell? You know the culprit? No, but I know the victim. I brought this poor woman.. whose husband was arrested by you, and thrown into prison. I'm not aware. I thank you for your information. When was your husband arrested, madame? Yesterday morning. But, he wasn't arrested to kill time, I guess! There's, likely,.. something to reproach him, that he has to explain. You took him as hostage. - Oh, that's different! And it was rumored today that you intend to shoot him. Oh, madame, I'm sorry. Sorry! He did nothing, Sir, I swear. Give him back to me! Give him back? Ah! You arrive too late, madame. He's been shot. You did that? You did that? That's not true. Say it isn't true! Calm yourself, madame, calm. He's been shot, he's been shot.. in my mind! Morally. A hostage,.. always ends up being shot, alas. With different languages, there's always misunderstandings. So he lives. We can see him, talk to him! What was your husband's job, madame? Baker. - At Uville? - Yes, Mr. Officer. Well then, they needed him, at Uville, to make bread. It's a good job, baker. A noble trade! You're going to return him to me, say! You can not keep him! There is nothing to blame him for. The snipers, Mr. Cure,.. Yes sir? they live in the woods, in the countryside, in the barns. I don't know! - Yeah ... But how do they live, finally, what of? Who's refueling them? I have no idea! - Well, they eat what? Bread! Who provides them with the bread? The baker! Oh madame,.. I pity you! - You can't be serious! - Pardon? But the baker can not... - All the same! All the same! The snipers cowardly murder our soldiers! They loot our equipment! Without the complacency of the populace, they would be wiped out long since! But everywhere they find scoundrels who supply them. Yourself, you encourage.. the insubordination of civilians. The silence of your bell.. is an intolerable measure of provocation! It is you, the French, who provoked the sanctions. Blood calls for blood! I apologize for this incident. Of course, you love your husband, madame. Imagine! I've been his wife for 25 years. I have five children. - Well, then,.. anyway, you won't remain all alone in the world. Five children... it is a consolation! I beg you, sir, I beg you, return him to me. Say, return him to me. He's a good man, you know. A true one! If you knew him! Everybody likes him. Isn't it, mister Cure? You can ask anyone. They'll tell you what sort of man is, my old man. A good man! Wouldn't harm a fly! If you take him away... if you take him away from me,.. what will become of me? I just have to let me die. Think, we've never parted, us two! Oh, he must be worrying at this moment,.. and fretting, knowing me in this state, so lost. It's the first time that I'd make him unhappy. He didn't deserve it. You can not kill a grandfather! Tell me, Mr. Officer! He's a grandfather, my old man. Finally, he hasn't worked his whole existence to get to this! He has nothing to reproach himself! This, I swear! I swear! He's done nothing wrong! He is French, madame. It's a heavy responsibility! Five children, think of it! I will try to arrange that. Would you tell me what's the name of the gentleman? - Bonin, Marcel. - Thanks. Karl. Shoot, right away, a man named Bonin. You know, the hostage. And carry the body immediately to his home. Your husband, will be home tonight, madame. Oh, I knew it! I knew you were not wicked! I told you, didn't I, curate? Oh, thank you, Mr. Officer, thank you. You have done a good deed. The good Lord will know. I had told you so. I am a man of good will. Curate, you owe me an Angelus. I salute you. What is it now? I'm hungry. - Well, you're not alone. You should have brought supplies. I told you there was no inn on the road. We should have arrived long ago, it's almost 4 hours. Could I assume we'd change route at least 4 times? Ah, I have a headache! Appetite is like all desires, must be fulfilled, or else... Is not it? - Oh, be quiet, I hold my desire. Oh, I have a hollow! Sleep! A meal of less is as much gain. - Yes but when I'm hungry I can't sleep. Of course one shouldn't travel without biscuits, it's ridiculous! I never, thank God, obeyed the orders of a stomach,.. which I always considered as a servant organ. But right now, I admit, I'm hungry. As for that, I'm very hungry! - It's very curious. I always thought hunger didn't exist, that it was a sentiment.. demagogic. Not at all! It is a reality. Ah, Chateaubriand! Truffles, roast pheasant, camembert...! - You ramble, my dear, huh? No, we should do as on the boats in distress: put a passenger on the spit. If we choose the girl Rousset, I retain the thigh. No, no, not the thigh. It is too light! You are priceless! He's priceless. What? Very good! Madame has taken some tasty precautions. I know nothing as comforting as to see someone.. eating with such a good appetite! If you would like some, sir, it'd be a pleasure to... - Oh, madam! But yes, yes... Well, so much worse! Frankly I don't refuse. I've had enough! All is fair in war! Right ma'am? Here! - Oh no, too much. I'm ashamed! No, no, I beg you. Please. Please. Please. Bon appetit, my dear. The thigh that I dreamed! That's cooking! Sister, if you wish to eat. Yes, yes. - Don't be shy, when hungry one must eat. You're right. With joy. I have the courage of my opinions. I'm hungry. No, that little wing is better. Here. Here, sister. I beg your pardon. We'll arrange. - Sure. Selfish! Do like me, ask her to lend you a small thigh. - I have dignity, I ! It won't do you any good! But wait, you'll see. Our charming companion would agree to offer a small piece of... of whatever, to Madame Loiseau? But, certainly! May I? May I? May I? Bon appetit, my dear. That's wonderful! Help yourself all, ladies, please. And offer to these gentlemen as well. This is talking! In these cases, we're all brothers and sisters. No ceremony! Accept, heck! Who knows where we'll spend the night! At this rate, we won't be at Clerc before noon tomorrow. Serve yourself, Count! Madam, we gratefully accept. Sisters... - Bravo! But you know, huh? The belly's gratitude is else than the heart's gratitude. But it's true that I have heart in the belly! Madam, your chicken is wonderful. Really, the pleasure of the palate is worth the pleasures we take otherwise. Miss, your bowl is a godsend! It is I who made it. Oh! So, you do cooking too! A masterpiece, this pie. I don't regret my trip. Do you think it's silly? Since two hours I wanted to share my food, and I dared not. - Thanks. But you shouldn't be embarrassed. We are open to all feelings. I saw you there, all hungry. It pained me. And I don't like seeing people unhappy. But... just don't look at them! No, decidedly, say whatever, life is really nice! No, no, don't panic! I'll see if there is no danger in sight. Great! Maybe we can picnic. So what? - If this goes on, I unhitch. Oh, that's it, we're in a hole! Oh, damned carrion of filthy crap! Hey, get out, give us a hand! Hurry, it'll soon be dark. The days are like whores now: barely risen, already lying! Careful, there are ladies! - But I'm not speaking of them! Oh! Oh, what mud! What a slime! What muck! Oh pardon! What is that? Oh, nothing! It is the cannon! It's the cannon? Well, and this? Rest assured! Rifle shots. - Rifle shots? Oh, my friend, but...but there is mud! Of course! If it wasn't mud, we wouldn't be bogged! Come on, you have to push now! - Carrion of filth of junk of crap! Oh, by God... oh, pardon, sister. Say what you will, but leave God alone. Well, shall we go? Oh, no, sister, not you! - Why? I've freed others from the mud! Carts, ambulances, and even cannons! Come on, are you ready? - Huh, let's go. You'll get bogged down... - Look at that! Oh la la! Come on, all together! Ho, hoist! Oh, what a life! I'm in democracy up to the ankles! But no! It is slime of the old regime! Come on, push! Stop! Don't move! Pass control! Will you get off, gentlemen, and get out your passes. Have you told them they shall get off and show the passes? Go, go, by here. Go on, go on. Show your passes, and quickly. They'll be returned tomorrow morning upon departure. Go! Hello gentlemen, good morning. Count and Countess de Br?ville. - Go, quick! Gentlemen. - Go, go! Go on! Gentlemen I have the honor to greet you. - Go! Well, why are you looking at me like that? - Oh, nervous? You're afraid of me? Afraid of you?! You have delusions of grandeur! Carrion of filth of junk of crap! Cider, wine, beer! Take what you want. Make yourself at home. The bottles are on the table. We must enjoy it. - Here, it's without ceremony ! There's wine, good. - Thanks, Mr Folanville. The wine, I charge it more, of course. It makes more drunk, right? You, you have a face for wine. Your glass! - A face for wine, really! What if I drank but water? You'd be caught! - No. I would say, that woman is a liar. She betrays her world. Here, look at my wife. She also has a face for wine, and I'm not complaining! Don't listen to him, he'll get you mad. - And I, do I have a face for wine? Oh you! You mustn't love water. One has only to look at you! Did you hear? - But that's nothing! If you were there when we fought. There has been battle at Cl?res? - Right at my door! And it's not over! They fight at three leagues from here. - No! So close! 3 leagues! You sure of the number? - Yes, at Longueville. We hear them from here. - But something should be done. They should be pushed back. - They're just waiting for you, for it! Oh, me, what to say. I'm not made for war, I was born with an umbrella. It must have been a pretty sight. You know that I'm very glad I came so far? - Oh yes? Why? This trip allowed me to get to know you. Oh, you could meet me otherwise. - To know you and to esteem you. I'll tell you only one word, miss: "you're a gentleman". Which sets you apart from Mr Loiseau, for example. Well, "gentleman". First time I've been called so. - Don't be silly. Just now, by replying to the Prussian at the diligence, you made me happy. But surely I wouldn't have hugged him! Miss Elizabeth Rousset! It's me. The Captain requests you. Quick! Me? - Ja. He told you why he wanted to see me? - Nein. Yeah... Well, I'm very sorry, but I won't go Well, well ... I have no advice to give you but, in your place, I'd go see that gentleman. I left Rouen just to not see them. - How is that officer? Young? Old? It's a Prussian. - And he's nice? - Be it as it is, for what I care! Oh, madam! Madam, you are wrong. Your refusal may cause considerable difficulties,.. not only to you but to your companions. They're the strongest, thus the masters. We don't know yet if they're the strongest. It's not over. Besides, if Prussia wins the war, she'll never recover. At first glance, of course, this approach poses no danger. This is probably a formality forgotten. But of course. By whom did you get your pass? Not by the Prussians, anyway! If it's a whim, do it, but remember that we share the risk of your imprudence. Take responsibility. I wish to point out that I'm not part in this debate. Whatever your decision, don't worry about me. You, you! It's not just you. We have women here,.. weak women whose existence is precious. So, madam? Yes. So? So? I do it for you. Wait for me, wait for me. I'll show you the way. It wasn't easy! I'd never guessed someone of her status would be so hostile to the uniform. Why? It's only natural! What does she do, that lady? - Well, I think it shows. She's a... - A what, Mr. Carr?-Lamadon? She's... from Rouen. Oh, so what, Mr Folanville? It's over. - Already! Well, it wasn't worth all the fuss! Moreover... Moreover, here she is. A little wine, please! Well, miss? - A great scoundrel, your officer! Oh! Our officer! He was brutal? - He hasn't respected you? What did he want, then? - That only concerns me. Well, well, let's not insist. Miss has her secret. Let us respect her silence. She's quite right not to answer you. This story has no interest. The officer wanted to see her, he saw her, he's happy. We don't wish more. All this shouldn't prevent us from eating and drinking. To live, finally! Drink, eat, digest! Proud motto! The motto of Louis-Philippe. Oh, sir, do me the grace not to mix Louis-Philippe with your philippics! I just say the gentleman has royal ambitions. Nothing derogatory. Gentlemen, gentlemen! No unnecessary bad mood! We arrived, we're having a good and honest meal,.. with charming women,.. in the inn of Mr. Follenvie. What more?! - Yes! The meat is delicious, the wine is rich and speeches are vain, ah ah! Long live us, and down with the others! Shut up you! It's 9 o'clock! You make too much noise! Captain orders you! Climb straight into your rooms. Go, go! Immediately! There! If you had behaved properly, instead of screaming like a skinned man! But I wasn't shouting. I call on our friends. I advise you not to linger here. In short, we're under yoke! - You shouldn't make you beat, my dear. But I don't consider myself beaten, my dear! They might well give us trouble. Miss! Sir! Quickly. In your rooms! You'll finish your dinner up there. - Go, go. - Finally! Sisters! Sisters! Since you don't sleep here, the girl will escort you to the hospital. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Goodbye, folks. Tomorrow morning, you'll be awoken at six. The coach leaves at eight. I will not be there. I stay in bed until ten o'clock,.. because of my asthma. Good night! - Thanks. Good night. Nein, nein, nein! What? Nein, no leaving. - Huh? And why wouldn't we leave? You get horses home. Order of the captain. Couldn't you say so last night, sort of vulture? - Ja, captain's order. Not worth repeating, I know French as well as you! Come on, I'll snore a little. Hello ladies! Hello kids! So then, the others are not there yet? They haven't come down yet? They will make us be late. And to say that we must go back in that hearse! But my word, the horses are not yet hitched! Where's the coachman? He should be there with his horses! He's not in the yard? - But no! He needs to be shaken up! Gosh, that's not normal. - We can't leave at noon! Hey! So? Wake up, it's almost 8 o'clock! We don't leave! - Oh yes! You leave in 15 minutes. Hurry up!. - We don't leave! Will you let me sleep? So what? - You can go back to your lady, you don't leave. How, we don't leave? - It's like that. - Hello sir. Here you are! - You had a good night? - It seems we won't leave. That's nice. Want to extend your stay? Not at all! It's what the coachman just said to your maid. He hasn't hitched? - No. - Oh, that! - No, since we don't leave. I'll go see. - My wife did tell me, this trip will never end! Oh, my dear Loiseau, I have the honor to greet you. So, we set out again? Good! - No, we're not leaving! What's that, we don't leave? - And just why? I'm asking you! Citizens, hello the Brotherhood! I'm not too late? You're early. We don't leave. Really? And why we don't leave? - We were given no explanation. Well, let's ask. Mr. Loiseau? You forgot a bag. I should've left them all. We're not going. We don't go? - We don't leave? - You hear? He says we don't leave. Who said we don't leave? - Mr. Loiseau. - Oh! Then we leave. But you see we're not leaving! Oh! Then? So! What you want me to say? No departure! Captain's order. Why, what's with him? He didn't say. May be a man with crotchets. Whim of conqueror? - Strategist tactic? - A general measure of the occupier? Oh, sisters, you know the news? No departure. Order of the captain. Good. When they'll decide departure time, you will call us. Did you hear? But what is it still? - It's not a rifle shot. Rifle or no rifle, we can't sit here at 3 leagues from a battlefield! I don't want to catch a bad shot. A shell is quick to arrive, huh? This is quite my opinion. The battle may extend! - Of course. Ah! Here's the other. Good morning. I'm not too late? You had a good night, yes? Well, you can go back to bed. We don't leave. Is that true? - But look at Mr. Loiseau. It's written on his face. Oh, you! You have no responsibilities. But I have money to recover. I can not afford to die now! Well, we can not stay so in the expectation. Mrs. Follenvie! What, now? - The room of this officer? - Why? - We will ask for an explanation. He won't see you. Only Mr. Follenvie can go to his room. Well, tell your husband to come down. Impossible. He sleeps until ten, because of his asthma. And can be awoken only in case of fire. This, I was well recommended. Fire! - But what's the matter with you? - Nothing. Fire! I'm calling Mr Follenvie. Fire! But my life is as precious as his sleep! Fire! "Not before 10 o'clock!" Well, that's what we'll see. Fire! The officer! Here I am! Here I am! Where is it burning? Above all don't say it was you to cry "fire". He'd smash it all! You do not know him. He's a brute! I'm here! So? - A brute! So what? - Did you hear? No, what? - They cried fire. - Where? - Here. Here? No. - I know what I say. I was sleeping. They cried: "fire!" I heard nothing. I know what it is. It is my.. asthma, which goes to my head. I'm going back to bed. 8:45, it's not worth it. - 8:45 ! But... but why didn't you leave? Because at the last moment, the captain objected. - No! - Yes. Why? - This, he didn't say. This is worrisome. - If you were kind,.. you could ask the captain to kindly grant us a hearing. But, he'll send me for a walk! No. You only have to give him our visit cards. - Yes, with our titles. Do this for us, Mr. Follenvie. A good move! Well... I'll go. Well, I'm hungry. - That's the sign of a clear conscience! - Mrs. Follenvie. But you can stay ladies, don't be shy. Here! Oh, well! There is no longer much left to eat. Madam, it is not like before. But if you wish, I can cook a cutlet. No, I prefer chitterlings. As for you, you dare eating in such a moment. What has of extraordinary this moment? At morning, I always eat a little. Did you hear? It's the door. Already. The captain didn't want to tell me. He will see you tonight at 9 o'clock. 9 o'clock! We won the first round! Well, count me out for the tie, I won't go see this guy. I have no curiosity. At 9 o'clock, I'll smoke my pipe. It's nine o'clock. - No, not quite. Go ahead. Herein! Come on in! Mr. Loiseau, wine merchant. Count Hubert de Br?ville. Carr?-Lamadon, general advisor. So what? I must confess, we have been this morning, painfully affected by... Go on! So what? Upon learning that our departure was deferred by you,.. we naturally thought... What you think, I do not care! So then? May I ask the reason of the prohibition that strikes us? No! - But, is this measure aimed at us personally? It's my business! Can we leave soon? It's my business! So then? Let me draw your attention to the fact that our important pursuits... Enough! Important pursuits? There are no other important pursuits in time of war,.. but war! Get out! Could I beg you... - No. Get out! Good evening! I have, sir, the honor to greet you. - Me as well. - Excuse us please, cap... Out! Raus, raus, go! Not too early! - What did he tell you? - You were not too violent, at least. But, everything went on wonderfully,.. in an atmosphere of dignity and mutual goodwill. When do we leave? We have maintained our respective positions. No decision has been taken on either side. Yes, finally, for now we remain. It's the only attitude that suits. In short, we are no better off than before. But,.. do you know just why we can't leave? He was very... very evasive. He didn't say he held you as hostage, no? What? - Oh, but I'm asking just in case. But...he didn't say anything like it. Hostage...no! He wouldn't have received us that way if he had such intentions. Really, you had the impression, you, that he spoke to hostages? Certainly not. Miss Elisabeth Rousset. Miss! They're calling you. What do you want? Captain asks, you not changed your mind? No! Tell him that I'll never change my mind. Is that clear? Well, well. Dear madam, you seem upset. - Do not be so impressionable. Give her something. She's so pale! - A little alcohol? No thanks. If only I could tell what I think to that rabble! What did he want exactly? - Oh, it only concerns me. What did he say last night? Nothing of interest, I swear. - Give me your hand. There! You don't trust us? Come on. Tell us this big secret. Yes, we might believe that you don't trust us. Come on. She has a fever, you know. - We are listening. What wants from you this officer? - What he wants? What? He wants to bed with me, that's what! I like that better! We're no longer hostages. This officer has no restraint. It's an outrage! If he counts on me, he can keep waiting. I'd rather kill me, you hear, kill me! But don't even think of it! Yes, come on, think no more! Mr Follenvie, calvados for everyone! Forget! You must forget, and not make a face like that. What do you risk? We're here! So! So... Finally. Now we know why we stay here, huh? Here, Mr. Loiseau, taste that. - Thanks, it's old? Of the other war. - Oh, anyway. To your health, gentlemen. To your beauty, ladies. To your courage, miss. Time will tell, tomorrow is another day. It's a former hostage who tells you. Let's sleep on it. Hello, my dear. - Hello my dear Loiseau. You had a good night? - Yes. You think we'll go tonight? - I doubt it. Not me. After careful consideration, I feel that the girl went to the victor. You're optimistic. Clearly, you don't know women. When they decide not to do something! Hello, Count. - Already up? - You know the news? We leave, maybe? - Oh, no way! - Going good! Miss Elizabeth Rousset has left. She did not! - But she has no right! - This morning at 7:30, she was out. Yes, but, she'll be back? - But, the cards say neither yes nor no. And... and the other up there? - No. He knows nothing yet. You realize the consequences of this escape? But we serve as a kind of guarantee deposit. As hostage, my dear, hostage! They're going to shoot us! What a bitch! Oh! Here you are! I'm very glad, you know, very glad. You look good, very good. - We were talking about you, precisely. We didn't see you, so we worried. - Well, not need to. I was in the country for a ride with Mr Cornudet. In town we get up so late. And you had a good night? - Very good, thank you. You heard the cannon? - No, why? Because it's all I heard. When I hear it, I fall asleep to no longer hear it. - You're lucky! So, miss... - What? You haven't received new demands, right? He won't itch anymore. - Oh yes, but if he persisted? He doesn't know me! I'm very stubborn. I'll never yield. Then, as a friend said: you're no smart, so if you get an idea, keep it. Whereby, this situation can last very long. Yes, very long. You have no obligation, you are expected nowhere? - Nowhere. You don't feel that you'll get bored in the long run? With you I'll never get bored! And then, I can't get bored, I think of nothing! - Charming! She's charming. And, if tomorrow that idiot gave us back our passes, I?d be inconsolable. Let us hope anyway that the night will bring him advice. You lost, gentlemen. We do another? - No, that's enough. Thank you. Oh, good, good, as you like. I like dominoes, it makes you reflect. Me too! But 15 games of dominoes, 4 hours of play! I can't take anymore! I am completely besotted. - And this is only the third day. Do you know... do you know how many steps is this room? - No. 25 in the lengthwise,.. 12 in the widthwise,.. and the staircase has 25 steps. Here is where I am, me. Well, gentlemen, have you found an idea? Well, we're not going to die of old age here,.. because this girl wants to choose her lovers! Since it is her trade to do... this, with all men. After all, this officer behaves well. He may be "deprived" since a long time. He's the master after all. He needs only say "I want", and can take us by force. When I think.. that she let us go meet this gentleman to ask for explanations,.. while she knew very well what to expect. What a creature! There's only to tie and deliver her. Since he wants her, we'll give her! Come, come, anger leads you astray. What's it all about? To leave as soon as possible. Good. Why can't we leave? Because of Miss Rousset. Well, it comes to help her decide, to persuade her, and above all,.. to not upset her. Diplomacy is the strategy of civil men, well, gentlemen,.. let's be civil. Mr Follenvie offers us nuts. Who wants any? Some nuts, madam? - No thanks. Jam, dear lady? - Yes, thank you. - Another drop of Burgundy. The king of wines can be given only to queens. I don't want to lose my balance. - On you, drunkenness is one more charm. Oh, madam already has a lot of... - What? Well, she doesn't need that. Madame! Why deprive us of the madrigal of Mr Loiseau? You know what we would do if we really were great politicians? We'd open wide our cellars to the enemy. - What for? And we would cynically abandon to him.. our most ravishing compatriots. Perfectly! He would lose thus, in intoxication and lust, all his warlike ardor. Good food, good wine, beautiful women, that's the arsenal of France,.. its ammunition. - Yes, yes. Perfectly. So you believe that we won at Austerlitz with partridges on toast? Comical. Very comical! Have you forgotten the history lessons? Do you believe that Cleopatra was to pass to posterity.. if she were merely a virtuous queen? No, gentlemen, no. Cleopatra bewitched the enemy generals. No? - Yes! And the proud victors fell asleep in her arms, and awoke as slaves. Because Cleopatra was a patriot, her. Not possible! She did that, this woman? - Yes, ma'am. Champagne, Follenvie. But, generals were dumb at the time! - And Judith with Holofernes! The Jews would have been massacred without the admirable conduct of Judith. What did she? - To save her countrymen, she spent the night with him,.. and in the aberrations of pleasure, she slew Holofernes. For Judith was a patriot, she too. - Well, you think of me what you like,.. but if Bismarck or Moltke came to Rouen, well, I wouldn't hesitate. I would do like Cleopatra with her... her...well, her own Bismarck. And you would be plaited with wreaths! There are heroic caresses... National kisses... It is when they seem to be succumbing that women resist best. That's sure. Men believe to be loved because we like them. What a joke! Often we love them to get rid of them. The end justifies the means. And God forgives the fact when the motive is pure. Is not it, sister? Perfectly. Beings are always better than is thought. Of course! Oh yes, one should not rely on reputations. Yeah! I was on all the battlefields, in Crimea with Canrobert, not an easy one! In Mexico with Bazaine, in Algeria with Mac Mahon. I treated all wounded, men and women, on whom I could lay hands. And I didn't ask their opinion. I was called sister Rantanplan at the time. All this to tell you that in Mexico,.. women lured the French so to slaughter them. I spoke with one of them before her execution,.. she was a patriot! Of course, in normal times you feel part of your country, unknowingly. People we love, that we hate, and those you don't care for. And then when the Prussians arrive, burning, looting, shooting,.. then, we like the same people we hated. And you think of your country as someone, I don't know,.. as someone who saw you born,.. a childhood friend,.. and you'd do anything for this friend. That's funny. Miss. The captain asks... No! I didn't change my mind. He understands French, or not? Haven't I done well? - Alas Miss, long since the race of heroines is extinct. There are no more patriots! - You're right, I shouldn't say no. Judith wouldn't say no and so no more captain. Well, I'll tell him I agree. Let me do, it won't be long. But if you kill an officer in this inn, the Prussians shoot us tomorrow. They'll set fire at my house! - Stay here,.. I beg you. - Calm down, calm down. My child, my child, but you seem a little nervous. You have to go to bed, very wisely. Sleep on it. So, my child, you prefer to leave us here,.. exposed to all the violence that would follow a failure of the Prussian army,.. rather than consent to one of those complacencies.. of which women generally show themselves so prodigal. That's it, isn't it? You don't want to answer? Yes, well, I feel that this time the Count will eventually convince her. Basically, she's a good girl. Girl, that we see. Good,.. is to see! - Shut up now. - Why? I hinder you from listening? I fear she lacks finesse, and she may not grasp the Count's language. She is stupid! Those girls, they're animals. Or, as they say, beasts for pleasure! For me, my life is over, but there are the others,.. and their fate depends only on your whim. There are two sisters, who will care for the wounded of Le Havre. Remember, the unfortunate casualties of Le Havre. And forgive me if I spoke to you a little brutally,.. but I had to. I did my duty. So what did you tell her? - Everything. - And what did she say? - Nothing. Shall we wait long the pleasure of this girl? - It's her job to be desired. But believe me, doesn't do be desired who wants. Oh, I'm hungry, but so hungry... And the sisters, where are they? - Tonight they dine at the rectory. Oh, that girl, what a girl! But what is she up to? It's unbelievable! No! No! But then... The comedy is over. Tomorrow we'll be en route. Let's kiss our ladies, long live freedom! Have all my compliments! Your eloquence has paid off. I made understand the voice of the heart and of the reason. - Yes, yes. That little bitch! It was well worth doing so many grimaces to get this far! Little one? Little one! Remove this seat, Miss Rousset won't dine with us tonight,.. Miss Rousset dines with her fianc?. Long live the bride! Miss! Champagne, at once! With glasses, for captain. There, there! Right away! Right away! I drink to Elisabeth Rousset! - Too loud. - I drink to her,.. and for merit of the Country I propose to entitle her.. a square, as public as she is, a square where everyone will pass over. I said. - Bravo! Mr. Loiseau! Mr. Loiseau, you dishonor the nitwits. You are, all in all, a coward and a crass character. You aren't worth the slaps I want to grant you. Slaps or kick in the butt, I'm undecided. More so since I can't distinguish your behind from your face! I drink to Elizabeth Rousset,.. who, giving herself to save you, will only dishonor you. But, how should I take it? I don't understand you. Calm, Auguste. Be quiet. - But he goes beyond measure. But it's a provocation. Don't reply to this madman. What, Mr. Carr?-Lamadon!? - No, no, sir, no. He apologizes. We've heard nothing. Gentlemen, I beg you. Come, come, words have certainly exceeded your thinking. I can conceive, sir, your disillusionment. But say that she couldn't do otherwise since they're the strongest. If the French had a little perspicacity and wisdom,.. they would realize that the game is lost,.. and they would follow the example of Miss Rousset. No sir! They would follow the path shown by Victor Hugo,.. in his final appeal to the French, that you are. Here's what he says, Victor Hugo. "France owes to all peoples and all men to save the world. That all municipalities stand up! That all countrysides catch fire! That each house gets out a soldier, that each town gets out an army. The Prussians are 800.000, you are 48 million men. Draw up yourself and blow on them. On the march! Lyon, take your rifle, Bordeaux, take your carbine,.. Rouen, draw your sword, and you Marseille, sing your song! There's no powder, no ammunition? Wrong, there is. That everyone, rich or poor,.. worker, laborer, picks up anything resembling a weapon! Roll boulders, pile up cobblestones, take the rocks of our sacred land,.. lapidate the invader with the bones of Mother France. Citizens, in the stones of the way,.. what you'll throw in their face, it's the Fatherland." Here is what he says, Victor Hugo. Ladies and gents. There! You have lost! Another one? - No, thanks. So Fifi? 30 steps in the lengthwise,.. and 15 in the widthwise. Here is where I am. War is not a distraction. No, but the days are long. - Yes. It can't go on like this. Should invent something. - Yes. But what? We could perhaps arrange a small party. With your permission. - No, no. But I take care of everything. I will send Karl, with a carriage. He will bring us back some...some women. - Oh! - He's used. And we will spend a nice evening. - No, no! Need not set a bad example to men. And if it came to the ears of General... - Karl is very discreet. Nobody will know anything. Finally, do as you like, but proceed with tact. - Perfekt, Herr Ober! And voila! Finally a night that will be remembered. What do you say, Fifi? Me, nothing. I have but wait for the ladies. What is it? We're attacked! - Lie down. Chief, the stagecoach! - Come with me! On, come along! - The coachman should clear the road. - Yes, yes. Get out, on! So, on the left. - Yes, yes... The men, remove tree. - Remove the tree? - Ja, ja, clear the road. On! You hear, you? But what's the matter? Oh yes, you're having troubles... Raus, raus! Quicker than that! - Evidently, the snipers are not reasonable. Get out! Hurry! Sergeant, they come on time! Since there are women sitting here. Pretty women! Beautiful women, yes? Sch?n! Pretty, pretty. Eins, zwei, drei, vier. Go ladies, get in the coach. Come on, haven't you heard? Get in. - Fast. Hurry up! Go, go! - Come on, come on. No, no, not you, not you. Go up, you! - Don't you dare familiarize with me! We didn't guard the Bismarcks together. - What? Get moving! Wash your mouth out! Clear out, clear out! Quick, quick! Go! Drive! - Push back! - Yes! It's terrible! - What's going on exactly? The snipers attacked the Prussians, and of course we pay the consequences. Can't they leave us alone, those fools? There they are. - Where? - There. To the horses! Vive la France! But what's with that guy? - He's crazy! You're a bit mad? One shouts Vive la France when he holds a rifle. You have a casualty? - Yes, but us, what will become of us? Hum, yes. Well, casualty! Is it bad? - I've a bullet in the calf. You'll come to our place, 200 meters. You'll rest a little. It doesn't bother you too? - But no, no. Besides, I won't bore you long. I must go to Uville as soon as possible. Uville? - Yes. Didn't you hear the Prussian give orders to the driver? That's where he leads your wives. - The Staff holds the castle. You do as you wish. Me, I know what I'll do. You may walk up to the castle. - The castle? - To the castle? Yes, maybe. We would question the sentry. Sentries won't tell us anything. We'd better stop at the village. In those burgs, people know a lot more than anyone. Say, at Uville, you know someone reliable? - The Mayor. Yes, see the mayor or the priest. You will escort them. Already? - But it's late! - We won't get there before curfew! Don't count on it. And then, if you meet a patrol, you only die once, right? Come on, Louis, escort them, and take by the grove. Sisters,.. but you don't come with us? You don't need us. With the boy, you have nothing to fear. - Goodbye. And you, no imprudence! Because he's afraid of nothing. And by dint of not paying attention...Well. So, goodbye, gentlemen. Farewell, Mr.. Cornudet. Oh, we'll meet again soon, over there. Thank you sister. That's fine. You, sister, what will you do? - Us? We continue. There's nothing within 4 leagues! Only 4? Not the sea to drink. I've done more in Crimea. Ask General St-Arnaud, he called me sister Rantanplan. Goodbye, my friends. Good luck, huh? Sister Nic?phore, forward, march! Enter! Captain! The ladies. At last! Bring them in. - Yessir. Let's see, huh? Go, enter. Come on, quickly. Women! Beautiful women! Elegant luxury whores. But Karl has done this wonderfully! Good evening my ladies. Enter here. Don't be afraid. You won't be done no harm. Quite the contrary! I introduce you the big leader, Colonel Count Von Folsborg. It will take to obey him. His orders, as you say here, are desires. Lieutenant Baron Otto Grossling, our virtuoso. You will serve as his instrument. He will know how to make you vibrate! Lieutenant Marquis Wilhelm Von Eyrik, or Fifi. The ladykiller, romantic and sentimental. And finally the most handsome,.. the most zympathetic, the most charming,.. Captain Baron Kerfenstein. Bavarian,.. and king of the babblers! We don't understand. I'm the Countess Hubert de Br?ville, and I'd like... Very funny! Good morning, Countess! I beg of you! - Come on! The coat, ready you... Gentlemen, help thus the princesses. - But, finally, I'm not kidding. I am here at my cousin, Count of Uville. - And I am your cousin! The little one there, is for me. Unruly, what? Miss, your coat. Your coat, Miss. I don't need you. I can take it off by myself. - Bad character! I love bad characters. I know how to train wild animals. Very well... Don't touch me. I forbid you to get closer. I advise more docility, miss, or I complain to your headmistress. What headmistress? - And I'll refer you to your home, on foot, with two guards! Your coat, miss. Come on, hurry up, your hat. Your coat, quickly. Make yourself at ease. Take off your gloves! You're right. I beg your pardon, I hadn't understood. Reasonable. That's good. - Ladies. Take seat. You must be hungry. Sit down. And be wise. We'll drink to your beauty. Gentlemen, to champagne! At your orders! Come, little one, at table! Schnell! At table. - Quick, quick! Scary what happens to us. - No, they're very nice, very correct. If they come near, I slap them. - So they retaliate against us, thanks. Indeed, so far we can't complain. - Well, soon they'll see who we are! Oh, they saw it right away! You mustn't tremble. It's just a shot of honor to welcome you. You're afraid? You, French women? Afraid before enemies. Oh, that's not good! I wasn't scared. I thought that the castle blew up, and you with it! Oh, very funny! Come here, you. - I'm not a dog. - Come here! - And then? - Come sit beside me. You here with me. Come, quickly! Me, I come near you. Because you're the kindest and most... Here I am, my Baroness, here I am. First, you are mistaken. I'm not Baroness. No! Not possible! Well, me, I make you Baroness,.. until tomorrow morning! Sir, I repeat. I'm the Countess de Br?ville and my cousin... - Enough! Enough! Silence! These girls start to exasperate me! You are our guests for pleasure, not for boredom! So I advise you: be cheerful, very cheerful! And nice, very nice! And docile. Do your job honestly! And I want you to be witty and funny, very funny! Ladies, I'll render you cheerful! You must drink to be cheerful, and cheerful to please me. You have some very pretty eyes. - To your glasses, ladies! Salute! Gentlemen. One, two, three. One, two, three. Don't you tell me stories! You know, it is strictly forbidden! Forbidden walking on road after curfew! You spies! You ... you kaput. You be shot! You be shot! - But me.. have authorization of...of your greatness..general...Offizier Rouen. Me friend, yes, ja ja ... uh, ja ja. Where were you going? Where? - But it is a horrible mistake. General Baron Von Plattenburg .. Rouen is my host and my friend. Ich bin general counsel. Von... Carr? Lamadon. Me! Lamadon, you say? - La... La... Lamadon Carr?. Lamadon... - Ich, ja, ja. That I don't care! You knew exactly what you are doing! You have violated the rules. You will be shot! Shot! Do you understand? Be shot! Feuer! Enough! Silence! I don't understand. - Yet it's easy to understand. You'll be shot. That enough for you? What more do you want? Empty your pockets. - But, sir... - Empty your pockets! U...us attacked road by Prussians, in coach. Our dear wives taken here, Joint Staff, Castle Uville. Oh, General Staff! Here! Ladies? Your ladies? - Yes,.. ladies and us, in coach. Authorization travel by general Rouen. These are our passes. General, friend. Ja, ja. You...friends...General? - Yes, friends. So, we speak immediately to officer. - Yes, yes? Tomorrow morning. Impossible now. Offiziere...uh, uh... You, strong head, come here. We're going to blaze the punch. Come, thou. Yeah. Again, that one. Ein zwei drei vier...time. F?nf, sechs, sieben, acht... Time. The time, that counts one by one the seconds. I do not like pendulums! That one, I'll kill it! Just now. The time I spend with you,.. does not count, it's time lost, time off the pendulums. Gentlemen! I condemn this pendulum to death! It saw its last quarter hour. Pray for it. I will pray later. Now, I am thirsty. These ladies are thirsty. To the punch! To you the honor, lieutenant! It's always the devil that ignites hell. Great! For us two, rum! Want some fun, you? Here! We took Toul. You can take Rum. Here. You are the nicest. - Wake up my doll, enough sleeping like that! I see you're accustomed to officers. - Kiss me better than that! It's they who made you love music? - No,.. no, I learned the piano at home. - At home? It's a good home, your home? You have the sad booze! It's good! I love it to be romantic. In France,.. all girls are romantic. Ladies! Gentlemen! A solemn moment. Silence, France! I drink.. to our victories over hearts. I drink to your defeat, ladies. I drink, finally and above all, to our victories over France,.. to our conquests, to our flags. I drink to Wissembourg, to Reichshoffen,.. to Forbach, to Gravelotte. To Toul and to Metz! Finally, I drink to Sedan. Damned woman! I pray you, gentlemen. This only concerns me. Look after the ladies. My compliments. Decidedly I like you a lot. If you do it again... I like to be resisted. It's a habit I had lost since I was in your country. You wouldn't say this, if I were a man. - Indeed, I cannot chat.. with men in your country. When we approach them, they flee. You're lying, you bastard. What do you say? Bastard? You're wonderful. Enjoy it, go on. Enjoy your leftovers. One day you'll be driven back home with rifle butts in the ass. You're funny. Continue, continue. I love being insulted. Especially when I know that a few minutes later,.. the insulter will do her submission. You don't know me. You, you will know me,.. my love. I know you well. You're all alike. When you've seen one, you've seen them all. And don't look at me like that, you don't scare me! Patience. I have all the time. First you're going to ask my forgiveness.. before my comrades. Very amusing. You'll see. I shall know afterwards how to punish you. Punish me? Punish me? I'm not under your orders! Then first remove this cigar from your mouth. That is a rash gesture. It's over, Miss. I've laughed enough now! Now is time to pay. To pay! Little French filth! Bravo! Fifi, he killed the pendulum! For God's sake! Von Eyrik! What's the matter? Dead. - Are you sure? Where is the woman? Oh! She fled. That slut has killed d?Eyrik. And you are her accomplices! We're going to shoot you! Twelve bullets in the skin! So, you're sad, at least?! Stop you there! What came over you! Captain, bring these women in my office. Get out, quick. Quick, quick. Out. Imagine the scandal, if the general was aware of this affair. Nobody must know what happened. No one! And now.. must be found an explanation.. to justify the death of this poor d'Eyrik. But what explanation? Come in! Karl,.. one of the women escaped. Bring me back the whore! Dead or alive! Got it? - At your orders, Colonel. The death of d'Eyrik.. will be avenged! You! In this direction! Where are you? Let us divide! Down there! There! Soon you will be brought a pallet,.. and something for you to change. Don't worry,.. I think all will be fine. Father, I.. - No, no. No. It's God that must be thanked. Well then, what happened? - Nothing, my dear, nothing. We found the ladies at the castle, where they had been very well received. We continue our journey. You coming? - And miss Rousset? Well, I'd rather not answer. The Major, a true gentleman, made us swear to secrecy. All I can tell you, is that she has not very well behaved, huh? Oh, no! Not very well! - But where is she? God only knows. - Climb in, I don't advise you to go further. - Why? It's a matter between the Staff and us. - You saw the mayor, the priest? - No. Luckily we could do without their help. So come, since we go the same side. No, sir, no. I'll never go the same side as you. There's a place for you, enjoy. No, my place is not with you. I loathe bad company. What? Come on, ride! Come in. Commander, the parson. - Good, introduce him. Oh, you're finally here, reverend. No harm. Still, you've been found. - But, Colonel... You know why I sent for you? - But ... - No? You don't know? You don't know.. what happened last night! Dare thus say you're not aware of? Aware.. of what? - Everyone here is complicit. You know that Lt. d'Eyrik was murdered last night,.. and under what conditions. You know who killed him? Colonel, you ask such a question! A terrorist! As usual. It was found at dawn on the road, Lt. d'Eyrik. Assassinated. By a stab. Well, these killings must stop! From today the village of Uville will be subject to war discipline! Martial law was proclaimed. No more weakness! I've only shown too much indulgence. As for you, Cure,.. I advise you to show yourself more disciplined. The funeral of Lieutenant d'Eyrik will take place tomorrow. Make sure.. that the death knell resounds.. in this painful circumstance. I will not tolerate any excuse, any pretext! I said. Some time later, a patriot loved her for her noble action,.. married her, and made of her a lady worth as much as many others.
