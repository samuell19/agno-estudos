Do you even know what it is? There's party every Friday, party every Saturday. But on Thursday? Thursday? I want you to have lots of children. And to never sleep because of them. SALAMANDRA FILM PRESENTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH SPARKS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL FILM INSTITUTE A FILM BY BENŐ BARANYI ZANOX RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS Good morning, everyone. It's a great honor. Our guest today: Dani Márton, frontman of Ricsárdgír. - Am I right? - Yes, yes. I mean... yeah. Your new album is coming out. - Friday the 13th. That's the title, right? - Yes. - Where does it come from? - Our drummer is superstitious. And Friday the 13th was... when his father died. But I don't want bad vibes on a morning show. But... the point is that his father died. And then we... came up with this title as a joke. We can say that it had a profound impact on you. Well, yes. Are you feeling sick? Just in case. I don't like you being a lab animal. All those pills are going to ruin your liver. Eat some grapes instead. It's good for your nerves. But last time you said it's bad. Full of sugar. - I read about it later. - Thanks for the breakfast. - What's the hurry? Eat some more. - No, thanks. You want to take the rest? - Let me wrap it up for you. - There's no need to. Just take all of it. Come on, just take it. Here you go. I love you. - Will you always love me? - Forever. I will still love you even if you put on a 100 pounds and cut your hair short. ROZILOX PHARMACEUTICALS - Good morning. - I'm here to see Dr Gyula Karotúr. You're in which study? Zanox anxiety and panic attacks. - Excuse me? - Zanox. Do you want to go on with the experiment? Can we increase the dose? I was going to decrease it. After all, you are not so anxious, are you? Misi! If you have a panic attack, roll back your shoulders. Come on. Start breathing evenly, slowly and deeply. Focus on the air entering your body. Concentrate on the air entering your lungs and leaving through your mouth. Nose. Lungs. Mouth. Good. I'll give you 30 more pills. Any side effects? Dizziness, headache, insomnia, nightmares, hallucinations? - Nothing. - All right. I'll see you in a month. - How are you, aunt Margit? - Hi, Misi. Hi. - Hi. - Hello... hello. - Good morning, Misi. - Good morning. Choose one of each subject that you need for your graduation. This is grammar, literature, history, and that one is English. - I don't know. - I'd pick number 1 of each. That's my lucky number. Mine is 8. It's up to you. MATTHIAS, THE RAVEN KING'S POLITICS Ildi! What does distribution mean? - Where do you need that? - Nowhere, it just came to my mind. You don't need it. - In the spring of... - In the spring of 1241. - Great! - Through the Verecke Pass. Through the ver... verec... Verecke Pass, the country was attacked. - The main battle... - The main battle, - was on the 11th of April in 1241. - Was in 1241, on the 11th of April. - Near Muhi. - Near Cookie. - Where? - Near Cookie. Thank you. It was great. Memorable. I'm proud of you. - It was, indeed. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Janka? - Misi! Come on, let's get this over with. What's your topic in history? Matthias, the Raven King. King Matthias was... Matthias the righteous. Right. Or not? There's a... Honeymaid, at least try to pretend you speak English next time. Put one word after the other and make it sound English. Just try to say something, OK? - Cheers. - Goodbye. Are you coming to party with us? Well, er... I've got to go home... to clean. Why? Are you throwing a party? No... It's just, there's a mess and I promised to fix it. - Sure? - Maybe next time. OK. Then... - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Misi. Take care of yourself. - Bye. - Bye. TIME TO SAY FAREWELL The rosy starling can curry favor with the female only after the mating. Good. It's good. Then it completely changes its posture. It stands straight, bristles its feathers, and sings a mating song to his lover. - Satisfactory means B? - No, it's D. Oops. - That's OK, too. Congratulations. - Thanks. Aren't you supposed to have a party? - I am. - Aren't you going? What for? You're right. Why would you want to have a great time, right? There will be a bunch of morons. I don't feel like small talk. - Is that girl going to be there? - What girl? The one with the funny hair. The one that likes you. Why would she like me? She's looking at you with those eyes. She's like that with everyone. Nice. And finally the female stops dancing. She calms down, and the male is granted approval to coitus. - Could we watch something else? - All right. ♪ There's no singing for you ♪ ♪ The night is silent and blue ♪ ♪ It's our last time together ♪ ♪ But we don't speak to each other ♪ ♪ The night is getting calmer ♪ LAST TIME TOGETHER ♪ We have come to the end ♪ ♪ Time to say farewell, my friend ♪ ♪ 20 years may go by ♪ ♪ Before you will take a rest ♪ ♪ But it's a long way ahead ♪ ♪ And you've got to do your best ♪ ♪ Time to say goodbye to one another ♪ CALL JANKA ♪ 20 years may go by Before we run into each other ♪ ♪ ...and the morning finds us together ♪ The next song goes out to Attila Klabacsek, the best dealer.

Do you know anything about life insurance? CALL MISI You got your social security card on you? Very important... That's right, great music. I like it. There's a hunting knife on your throat. Do what I tell you and you'll be fine. We're just going to walk into the forest. Make a noise and I'll cut your throat. Good evening. Can I help you? Good evening. - No, thanks. - Have you seen anything strange? - No, I just got here. - All right. Have a safe trip home. Goodbye. Stop! Stop now! - Where am I? - It's the ER of Géza Hetényi Hospital. - Where are you going? - I've got to go. No, no. You're not going anywhere. I have to find Janka Szurdok. There's no one with that name here. - But where is she? - You've got a concussion, go back to bed. I need to know now. Couldn't you ask someone? Not if you don't go back to your bed. Come on. Go back to your bed. Here. Tranquilizer. Just don't tell the nurse. What was that? Pálinka. I don't like you being a lab animal. All those pills are going to ruin your liver. Eat some grapes instead. It's good for your nerves. What's wrong? We were looking for a catchy name. Ricsárdgír sounds cool. What's wrong? Bud Spencer would be catchy too. Has the cat got your tongue? Eat some french toast. - What day is it? - It's Saturday. What am I saying? It's Friday. FRIDAY THE 13TH MAY-2022 - Is it graduation day? - It is. I've got to go. - Have some more. - No, thanks. Let me wrap it up for you. - There's no need to. - Just take all of it. - I'll be late. - Take it. Here you go. God bless you. MATTHIAS, THE RAVEN KING I love you. - Will you always love me? - Forever. I will still love you even if you put on a 100 pounds and cut your hair short. I will still love you, when you're 220 pounds and loose all your hair. I will still love you after your teeth fall out. I'll give you 30 more pills. Any side effects? Dizziness, headache, insomnia, - Nothing. - Nightmares, hallucinations? Oops. I've actually... - had some kind of dream. - What dream? Like a nightmare or... - or a vision. - About what? About today. As if... everything that happens... I've been through already. But with a bad ending. Anyway. Andrea, please, write. This experiment is over. Meaning? I'll prescribe you something you can get in the pharmacy. One of our students had problems with Zanox. With symptoms like you. It's not cheap, €10, but it works. I've used it before myself. You've had panic attacks? I have. I'll get you a referral to Ms Szlovicsák. And did Zanox... make you have visions? I was allergic to one of the components, that's all. And did your student have strange dreams? He became disturbed. He ended up in a mental hospital. Béla Barna. You must've heard of him. He thought he could... see the future when he drank alcohol after taking Zanox. - Hi, Misi. - How are you, aunt Margit? Hi. - Hi. - Hello... hello. I'd pick number 1 of each. That's my lucky number. - Mine is 8. - It's up to you. MATTHIAS, THE RAVEN KING'S POLITICS - Good morning. - Good morning. Yes? Good morning, Mr Director. Do you have a minute? You're asking a lot. Sit down. Another one with the same symptoms Béla Barna had. Let's stop. - Just one? - Yes, another one. Thanks for letting me know. I'm serious. We should stop. Just stop then. You're allowed to. What do you mean? Stop testing? No. I mean, you can quit. Honeymaid, at least try to pretend you speak English next time. Put one word after the other and make it sound English. Just try to say something, OK? - Cheers. - Goodbye. Are you coming to party with us? - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi. - Hey y'all. - Hi. - What's up, Janka? Want some? - What is this? - Habitus. Totally delish. - Misi? - No, thanks. Just lap it up, you know, like a cat. LARD - Hello. - Oh my God, a chicken! - Do you like animals? - Only brown ones. - She winked at me. - Got a brown dog. I'll bring him with me. - How are you, aunt Kati? - Hi, sweetie pie. - Two tequilas. - Orange or lemon? - Lemon. - Let me cover it. But it's not for the group; it's for you and me. No, thanks. Alcohol has a strange affect on me. - It'll be €5. Lemon's expensive. - Thanks. You lick your hand first, and then the lemon. No. The salt. You lick the salt, drink it and then bite the lemon. Lemon. Do you like it? I do. All right, that's enough. Well. That's our house. Good night, then. Where are you going? What's satisfactory? It's B. That's not bad. That's good. I'm going to bed, mum. - All right. Good night. - Good night. - There was a spider in your hair. - A big one, too. Don't you like being touched? I don't know. Your mother never touched you? What do you think? It was nice. I'm happy you came. I would've been a loser, if I hadn't come. - That's right. - Janka! The police want to talk to you. Can we come in? Give me a minute. Misi! Help me. - Leave it. - All right. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry to disturb you. I'm sergeant Géza Schweiz. - We'd like to ask you a few questions. - Come in. - Are you sure? - Of course. We need to see a photo ID. - Were you at the Pub Kovácsék in Kóty last night? - Yes, I was. - In the company of Ildikó Tóth? - Yes. She was there too. - How long did you stay there? - Until about 9:45PM. - Why? - We can't answer that, sorry. Did you find the friend of the girl, whose throat was slit? We did. I'm sorry, but... your classmate, Ildikó Tóth... was found dead this morning... in the forest next to the pub. Our condolences. Please, tell us what happened last night. Anything related to Ildikó. Do you think you can do it now? All right. My condolences. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hello. - Hi. - Hi. Do you have pálinka? We do. What kind? What do you have? Apricot, pear, plum, apple, cherry, mixed. Then... I'd like a glass of pear. - You mean a shot? - Yes. Are you sure it was pálinka? - I am. - And... do you have the stuff... they keep in one of those... lemon juice bottles? - We don't sell homemade stuff. - Then I'd like a... mixed one. I'd like to try all of the rest. Can I pay by card? No. But I can give you 2 cent shots if you want. I can pay with cents? No. 2 centiliters. Smaller shots. All right... Then... give me that. Is the light out? Your father's ass is out! HOSPITAL Good evening. Excuse me... I just wanted to ask if you know... - a red-nosed man? - No. I don't. Yesterday... he was... He was supposed to be here in a room, where the sky is painted on the ceiling. Every room has sky on its ceiling. You must leave, there's no visiting hours now. I see, no problem then. Good night and... - Goodbye. - Good night. Excuse me. Do you know a man with a red-nose... - a red nose? - Józsi Carnival? At the other end of the corridor. - He's right there. - Thanks. Hey, you! - Where's the red-nosed man? - Józsi Carnival? Group therapy in room 112. You must leave now! This dude is hiding some pálinka. It is also in your interest to find it. Under the pillow. I don't understand. Norbi, you and Tamás come to the ER, right now. I'm József, - I'm an alcoholic. - Hi, József. - Hello everybody. I've been clean for 4 weeks. I'm taking the pills, but... it's still very hard. I have these tremors all day. And on top... I've had another car accident. That's also hard to stomach. So... - It was really hard to abstain. - That's really great, József. Well done. That's the way to go. - You should all be like him. - Thanks. I've got you! Where do you keep your pálinka? - Me? I don't drink. - You do. - I don't have any pálinka. - Are you holding it? Excuse me, but... What have we got here? It's him. - It was in his inside pocket. - What is it, József? Lemon juice. Bloody hell! He's even worse than I am. - The name of the band perhaps. - I don't like you being a lab animal... - Jesus! - I'm out of here. - Don't you want some french toast? - No, no. - I'll give you 30 more pills. Any side effects? - None. Dizziness, headache, insomnia, nightmares, hallucinations? Nothing at all. All right. I'll see you in a month. Great. And good luck on your final exams. Hi. - Hi. - Hi, Misi. Sorry. - No problem. - Come, Janka. Good luck. Janka! Just pretend you speak English. Just keep talking and make it sound like English. - OK. Thanks. - Go for it. Matthias was released by George of Podiebrad, king of Bohemia, on condition of marrying his daughter, Katharina. I mean, Matthias marries George's daughter, Katharina. Can I go? Uncle, Józsi! Long time no see. - You haven't changed a bit. How are you? - Me? Could be better. - But I'm all right. - Do you still have that great pálinka? Pálinka is off limits to me at the moment. You used to have that amazing one. If you had some of it in a lemon juice bottle, - I'd buy it right away. - And what about me then? Well... I'd make it up to you. Just hide it in my night stand real quick. Do it before they see it. And take that lemon juice bottle with you. Well... Your stuff is like no other. - Is it... apricot? - No. It's apple. Some kind of special apple? No, simple Red Delicious. I just spiced it up a bit. - With what? - Well... vegetable peelings. Potato, carrot. And some weed. It ferments too. And a few smaller animals. Whatever I can get my hands on. I've got to go now, but I'll be back soon. Just wait for me here. - Promise me that you won't leave the pub. - I promise. Ildi. Ildi! Who the hell are you? Misi's got into a fight. He smacked a guy with a mug. Come quick! Can you tell me your name? - Shit. - Do you know your name? Can you say your name? Are you OK? What's wrong? Nothing. TAMÁS MAN Jesus Christ! - Look at you. - Relax, no problem. - No problem. - What did they do to you? - What did they do? - I'll tell you later, no big deal. - It's just... I'll tell you tomorrow. - Tell me now. - Want some camomile tea? - No, thanks. Just a little. Good for poultice, too. Go ahead and drink it. So what happened? - I got beat up. - I can see that. - But who did it and why? - A guy. He wanted to jump Janka, and... - I defended her. - Jesus! - Did you call the police? - The police? - I'll call them right away, then. - There's no need... of course. - It was the first thing we did. - Take this. - Put it on your wound. - I really want to go to bed now. But your wounds must be cleaned. Good night. Good evening. I'm sergeant József Farkas. - Open the door, please. - That was fast. - I'm coming. - Don't open it! - Open the door. - Please! Do you know how much a door costs? - We'll use force, if you don't cooperate. - I'm right there. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Can we talk to Mihály Balogh? - Of course. - He's in his room. - Come out! Stop it or I'll cover your face with pepper spray! Stop it right now! Stop it right now! Put it on your wound. What is it? What pill did you just give me? It's your pill from the experiment. - This one? - Yes. Shit! I can't talk you out of it, and I can't help you take it either. I can only go back to the time, when I last took this shitty pill. What are you talking about? - Good evening, sergeant József Farkas... - Please, do not open! - I need 10 seconds. - Do you know how much a door costs? - Give me 10 seconds. - Open the door, please. Put it on your wound. Where are you going? - If the cops are looking for me, you haven't seen me. - What? Good evening! Can we have a word? Stop right away! Put it on your wound. Where are you going? If the cops are looking for me, you haven't seen me. What? - Good evening. - Good evening. - Can we talk to Mihály Balogh? - No. - He's not home yet. - I see. - We need to talk to him at the police headquarters. - All right. - Goodbye. What's going on, Misi? You can tell me. I won't be angry. Just relax. I'm here for you. We'll figure it out. Have you ever taken this medicine? - Of course not. - Are you sure? I've got my own pills. Why would I want to take yours? Let's give it a try. Take a sip from this. - What is it? - Pálinka. Will you do it for me? - I've brushed my teeth. - Please. Just a tiny little sip. Are you feeling something? It's crap. You guys drink this? - Dizziness, nothing? - Your grandma is tougher than that. What do you need that knife for? The only sharp knife I have. Make sure you bring it back. VICTIM OF ATTACK IS IN INTENSIVE CARE WITH A SKULL FRACTURE OFFENDER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED MISSED CALL JANKA Hi, Janka. Hi, Misi. Are you OK? I am. There are very... strange things happening to me... lately. And even I find it hard - to believe them. - Misi. Where are you? Walking around in the city. But where exactly? - Is he taking any drugs? - No. He isn't. He's only taking some experimental pills for his anxiety. He wouldn't take any drugs and he never drinks either. Except for today. Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Mrs Gersteinmajer. Mrs Magdolna Fukszreiter Trafikant. Sorry, it won't be a minute, I don't need to be examined. Good morning. Sorry. I'm not here for an examination. I won't stay long. Misi. I'm here because of Zanox. You've tried it before, too. Am I right? Who told you that? I think you did, but I might be wrong. The point is... yesterday I forgot to thank you and give you this little gift for treating me. It's my job, Misi, you don't need to give me anything. You'd make me very happy, I've made it myself. - I can't take it. - At least try it then... to see if it's any good. - I'm on duty. - Just smell how fruity it is. Please. All right. Let me see. - Misi! What's wrong with you? - Just take a sip from this. All right. Give it to me. - Stop it! What are you doing? - What do you think? Stop it! Stop it right now! Stop it, or I'll cut myself to pieces. - No! - Misi! Put the bottle down. - Tie up the doctor. - Let's just bandage you instead, Misi. - Put down the knife, please. - Stay right there. 2 liters of blood, and you'll pass out. I will only put down the knife, if you drink from it. - I'll drink it then. - I don't think so. Tie him up. And nobody will get hurt. Tie him up, or I swear I'll... - cut my throat. - All right. Andrea, tie me up. Are you hallucinating? Zanox must have disturbed your brain chemistry. Especially if you drink on it. Too bad, but you're not the first. Béla Barna might have been telling the truth. It's a special pálinka. Made by an old man with a red nose, out of Red Delicious apples. Józsi Carnival? Nothing else works, but if you drink this, you jump back to the time, to when you took the last pill of Zanox. Listen to me carefully, because you're going back to the past. Yesterday, on the 13th of May, a young girl, Janka Szurdok will be attacked in the little forest. Even though I've loved her for years, I won't have the courage to accompany her to the graduation party. I'll leave her alone, and a guy named Tamás Man will kill her. - Thomas Mann will help you remember. - I'm done. - Go back to your desk. - Let Andrea go. Go back to your desk. Repeat after me. On the evening of the 13th of May, Evening, 13th of May, in the Little Forest, Tamás Man murders Janka Szurdok. Little Forest, Janka Szurdok, murdered by Tamás Man. The cops must catch him, or he strikes again. POLICE CIVIL GUARD Open your mouth. Drink it! Drink! One day you'll be grateful to me. I'm police sergeant Ernő Radafuck. Open the door, Misi, or we'll break in. Are you feeling something strange? It's just plain pálinka. - With the pills it makes you hallucinate. - It's not true. I knew in advance that my lucky number was going to be King Matthias. You can't foresee the future. Your brain generates the feeling, that you've been through that before. Like an unusually strong deja vu. - No. - Right. Tell me what's going to happen. I don't know. See? Oh my God. - He jumped out. - Dear God. Stop right there! Stop! - Of course it's empty. - Stop, in the name of law! Put your hands up! On your knees! I'm going to handcuff you. Put your hands behind your head. Cross your legs. I'll treat your wound. OK? - Are you OK? - Sure. Béla Barna? Yes, professor. No, no. Nothing. Forget about it. Jesus! 2 DECEMBER 2019 I do have a question, Béla. I haven't given you any Zanox, have I? No, not yet. - Great. Thanks, enjoy your meal. - Thanks. Good morning, Fanni. Have you noticed any side effects, while taking Zanox? - No, I haven't. - OK. SEVERE HALLUCINATIONS - Any side effects? - Nothing. - Nothing. - Nothing. HAS IMAGINARY FRIENDS No, nothing. HEARS VOICES TELLING HIM TO KILL - Side effects? - Nothing. - Nothing. - Nothing. PSYCHOSIS ANXIETY AGGRESSION Zanox generated unexpected effects. In 68 out of 70 cases. Aggression, nightmares, hallucination. More severe symptoms if combined with alcohol consumption. It's hard for me to admit. But Zanox made people potential threats to public safety. What do you think, Mr Director? Should we go on with the experiment? Here you go. DRUG DISPOSAL Thank you. LOTTERY The winning numbers for the five-number lottery are as follows: 4, 27, 53, 67, 68. 4, 27... 4, 27, 53, 67, 68. 27 and 68.

I need to talk to you in private. Come. You don't know me, but I know you very well. I'm from the Orion constellation. Listen to me. I'm here to observe human behavior, and don't get me wrong, but we're totally fed up with the way you are fuckin' around with Janka. You've loved her for years. And still nothing? She digs you too. So tonight she's going to invite you to a party. Your last party together. And your very last chance to make a move. If you don't grab the opportunity I swear I'll break out in tears. And get rid of your shitty pills. That's all. - That's all I wanted to tell you. - Thank you. Wait. One more thing. Pick your lucky number in the history exam. It'll be Matthias, the Raven King.

I was so good, when I was talking about King Matthias, - they stopped me right away. - Wow. You're so clever. And you? - I failed in English. - But why? Because I don't speak English. - Are you coming to party with us? - To Kovácsék? ♪ If I don't work out my body, what will my son tell me? ♪ This film is a work of fiction.
