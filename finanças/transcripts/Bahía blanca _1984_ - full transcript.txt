Sometimes, I come to this old wooden jetty, as if curious about the world around me. The truth is, I am not. I expect nothing. The passage of ships near the islet means nothing to me. This window to the dawn is just the reflection of my life. And the old wooden boards that creak under my feet are like my old painful bones. For some years now, the light of the lantern in my house has been dim. It doesn't lure the mariners like it did in the old days. Those fishermen, on their way back to the port, who'd stop for a drink. And why not? To spend part of their money on some love. I was always willing to give. Now I am alone, truly alone, like the old legends from this islet incarnate in my body. Perhaps the beginning of the end was one morning in the nearest town on the islet. - Give me the bag, Ramiro. - Take it. - How are you? - A little dizzy. - See you soon! - See you soon! We're going for a walk. - It'll make you feel better. - It's useless. I'm from a dry place. - Why did you call me so urgently? - The mariners caught the body - of a local guy, Martin El Pocho. - But El Pocho was a good swimmer, right? Of course! I'm no expert, but I believe he didn't drown. What makes you say that? He has some weird scratches. And fishes don't scratch, right? I guess not, except maybe sirens. Thanks. - I'll wait for you at Casa Fuentes. - I'll be right there. Carlos! What's up? - The rent. - C'mon, Carlos, tell me. They found El Pocho's body, and Ramiro is here to do the autopsy. Autopsy? What is that? He's opening his guts to see if he was murdered. Father! Father! El Pocho has been killed! Father! El Pocho Martin has been killed! Father! Father! - Father! - What now? War, earthquake or revolution? - Hello, Father! - What's up with you, Silvia, my child? Ramiro is here, the doctor from Madero. It seems he's cutting up El Pocho. - But El Pocho is dead. Didn't he drown? - It seems he didn't. The sheriff thinks he was killed. What times, my child! Cutting up one of us! - You have a visitor. - Who? Where? There you see him, pretending to be well-mannered, that thug Andy. I didn't let him wait for you inside, because he's capable of hitting me with a bottle. Dad, don't be like that. Andy is a good guy. Good? A guy working for Raul Sebastian, a good guy? Why do you hate Raul Sebastian? I've seen him. He's an elegant man, and looks like a nice gentleman. A nice scoundrel. That's what he is, a scoundrel! Good morning! Good morning! Since the government put him in charge of the administration of the island, he's been stealing! Taking, and even killing, I believe. I wouldn't be amazed if he was involved in the death of poor Pocho Martin. - No way! - Can I get some service! But Father! But nothing! I don't like you hanging out with that guy, Andy. Oh, he's outside! - Oh, these kids! - Dad, I'm not just friends with Andy, I'm going to marry him. Get used to it! See you! If your mother were still alive, she would fix you! See you later! Andy, sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. Leon, do you have Trujillo's Pisco? Yes, ma'am, I'll get you a bottle. - Hey, you silly! Why the rush? - Didn't you read the sign? - "Beware of the aggressive father." - Don't be stupid! You know how dads are. I don't. Mine died when I was very young. He got mad because I said we're getting married. He better get used to it. You need to ask him for my hand formally. Instead he's going to give me a foot, a really hard kick! Don't overreact. He's grumpy like all old people, but he's a nice man. I'm sure you'll get along. - Let's walk to the lighthouse. - Good idea. I love lighthouses. Especially when they're empty, and couples can sit there and look out at the sea and kiss passionately. You're shameless! Take it. You took longer than usual. So disgusting! Your office doesn't have running water. Why did you take so long? - Because he was killed. - He was killed? I told you he had a lot of scratches. Besides the scratches, he had a bullet in his brain. - Shotgun? - Revolver,.38. - Who could have done this? - No fucking idea, but he was really drunk when he was killed. - It's possible to know that? - Of course it's possible! When the medical examiner performs the autopsy, he can look into the corpse like an open book. But you don't know that, my poor sheriff. Of course, Mr. Oscar, I'm a stupid idiot, but I'm lucky you're here. Please, enlighten me with your wisdom. You don't take me seriously, but I can tell you a lot about that crime. Huh? Ramiro! This is Mr. Oscar. Let me introduce you. Dr. Ramiro Sarmiento. - Nice to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. - Are you a doctor? - Yes, a medical examiner. How can a doctor be friends with this ignoramus? Well, you see... - You look foreign. - My grandma was English. How degrading! The grandson of an English lady, fraternizing with these nobodies. If your grandma was here, she'd perceive the strange magnetism of these lands, the strange call of the islets that surround us. Cursed islands, with a scary telluric force, especially Deer's Island. The most ancient legends about these lands are about Deer's Island. It looks uninhabited, but strange women live there at night. They come out from the sleeping crater and lure the fishermen with a strange light. With magical chants, they seduce the men who dare to go near, and they kill them. Laugh, you imbecile! But that's how Pocho Martin was killed. Andy! Andy! Have a nice trip! Carlos! Carlos, wait! - Where are you going? - To Deer's Island. Can I go with you? But your work is done. Can I go with you, yes or no? Okay, let's go. I don't understand why you want to go. I don't even want to. Because of all those things the guy at the tavern said. - Don't pay attention to that idiot. - Oh, really? - Then why are you going to the island? - Well, you see, just because. How long are you staying? I don't know. Go back to work and pick us up later, when you can. Let's go, Ramiro. - It's just water. Are you dizzy again? - A little bit. Let's go to the old tavern. I was told it's open sometimes. Creepy place. I've seen worse. Hey! Anybody here? Open up. Anybody here? Come on! Can I come in, yes or no? Listen, some music. Nice chick! Good morning, outsiders! Good morning. Who are you, and what are you doing on this island? - You don't know how to say good morning? - No. Who are you, and what are you doing on this island? I do whatever I please. This island is mine. And who are you to come and disturb a lady at this time of day? I'm Sheriff Fernandez, Commander in Chief of Cochinos Bay. Aren't you... - And aren't you... - Carlitos, the hairy one! - And you're Mandanga. - Carlitos. Mandanga. You're heavy! Who's this friend of yours? That's Ramiro, the medical examiner. Of course, that's why he has that sad face. No way! You should see him when he's working. He's like a cyclone. I'm sure I'll see him. Oh, sorry. Like a cyclone, huh? The truth is, he looks like a fool. Not at all! He's a doctor. So, what about you? You're a sheriff now? Life is full of surprises. Last time I saw you, you were in your underwear, escaping through a window, being chased by the police. And what about you? Do you remember when the community of women of grace expelled you from Valparaiso? I said to the lady with glasses, "You can kick me out of Valparaiso, but I'll kick you out of the continent." She punched her, then she fell in the sea. She looked so funny when they took her out of the water. - Funny, right? - And how did you become a sheriff? Do you remember when Governor Madero fell from grace, and they replaced him with Meliton? - And Meliton made you a police officer? - Meliton fucked me. He incarcerated me. A personal vendetta. Of course! You slept with his wife. How did you know that? Everybody knew, except Meliton. - And the day he found out! - He put you in jail! - But Meliton fell from grace too? - There you go. Madero returned and made me a police officer, but he sent me to the fifth hell! Of course! So you don't fuck his wife. - Hey! How about a beer? - Beer? Is this thing for beer? Oh, you didn't know? A client brought it as a gift, and he put it there. He probably stole it from some tavern. I have some wine, guajolote, or rum. - Wonderful. - I have everything in this pigsty. You haven't told me how you ended up on this island? Long story. Do you remember Maria? Of course, your sister. Did something happen to her? No, she's fine. But she was caught in a raid. She was with me, but those pigs took her in for prostitution. I tried to explain to them that she had nothing to do with it, and she was too young, but they wouldn't listen to reason. They took us both! I can imagine the reasons you gave them. Well, I did hit a cop's head with my heel. So did they let you go right away? No way! We escaped, and we ended up here. Your friend doesn't talk at all. Yes, but I'm cautious. Well, I'm here because in the town... - What town? - Conejera. So you're the sheriff of that shitty little village? Little village? Show some respect! Population: 700. 701, including the son of that tart who gave birth yesterday. Oscar el miserias, he insists this islet is cursed, and there are some sirens. - Oh, thank you! Bring him here. Jokes aside, Pocho Martin, he was a good guy, my friend, and he was killed. Oscar says it happened here. You're speaking a foreign language. Only Maria and I live here. Wasn't it an accident? Yes, he met with a .38 caliber bullet. And who the fuck said the bullet was from here? Don't freak out, Mandanga. I have to ask questions. It's my duty. Do you have a lot of customers around here? Fridays and Saturdays, some fishermen come. Besides, I have someone to protect me. You're amazing! You've found a protector in this deserted place. But around here, the only one who has more than a dollar is Raul Sebastian. You're right! Raul! Don't fuck with me! Have you been able to hook up with that bastard? Yes! Raul, so proper and respectable. He goes to church every day. He pisses holy water! Hey, Mandanga! I can assure you, he knows how to do other things, but he doesn't demand a lot. He only comes once a week, and he gives me money to keep my mouth shut. - It seems it doesn't work. - Hey, you! No insults. This one here, he's like my brother. And me? Friends of my brother are like brothers to me too, or little sisters. And if your tongue loosens, you can meet a.38 caliber by accident. - You don't mean that, right? - Of course I mean it. But it doesn't matter, you're the special friend of the government administrator. - Right? - Of course, it doesn't matter. Are you going to write 'accidental death' on the death certificate? No! They put a bullet in the guy's skull. It was a crime. A bullet! A bullet! Why do you care, one bullet less or one bullet more? Especially if one bullet less means your peace. Of course, because if I say to Raul Sebastian, while he's about to come on me, that you tried to rape me, what then? Would you dare to do that? Yes, she's capable of it. Then I'll sign that certificate. To the happiest medical examiner in the whole country! If Raulito were to leave with another man, I'd follow him by land and sea. If by sea, in a military train. Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria, have you been listening? Have you? What's up with you? Have you heard that I killed that son of a bitch? So what? He deserved it. Or maybe you liked what he did to you? Quiet! Quiet! I can't joke with you? - Take my hand, Mr. Raul. - Thank you. What a damn life! Ramiro, you're drunk. Did you notice that you're drunk? Ramiro! - Get in! - Miss Alida must be in bed already. Is that you, Raul? Wait for me in the bar. I'll be upstairs with her. I'll be done in an hour and a half. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes. How are you, my darling? I thought you'd never come. - I'm tired of babysitting! - But you get good pay for it! - Don't you? It's always like that. - You get better money for jobs you dislike. Ramiro! Ramiro! - I'm Raul Sebastian. - Shut up! There's someone there. It's probably him. Raul Sebastian. Oh my god, what do we do now? C'mon, let's go. We're leaving through the back door. Oh, my head! - Let's go! - My head! It reeks of alcohol in here. Yes, somebody was here earlier. Some drunk fisherman. How gross is the boss! Fucking a woman that fucks until the last filthy stevedore is done. She's hot. She has nice tits, but her ass... She's hot. You should come by yourself and fuck her. Good idea, I'll come and fuck her. She'll teach you some tricks for your wedding night. I don't need any tricks. I know everything I need to know. Don't forget, I'm the official handsome lover of Paca the bunny. Paca the bunny! What an ordinary bitch! You left me alone for so long this time. I have tons of work. A lot of work, and a lot of responsibilities. You drive me crazy. - I can't live without your touch. - My love. - I brought you a present. - What a joy! Give it to me. No, no, first undress. Don't be like that. No, undress. Please. Undress now! You're a fucking whore! Oh, this damn thing. Done! What's wrong? Why are you laughing? See for yourself. Look at you! My present... Help me put it on. It's gorgeous. Take it! Take it, you whore! Take it! Go on, go on. - And Silvia, she's a virgin, isn't she? - If you doubt it, I'll kill you! She's a saint! - Haven't you fucked her yet? - Asshole, who do you think I am? I have a lot of respect for her! - Do you want advice from an experienced guy? - No! If I were you, I'd sample her before taking her to the altar. You're crazy! What if she doesn't taste good after you try her? She's the most beautiful of all the girls on all the islands. That don't matter at the time of the deed. - I think she's ordinary. - Ordinary? You wish you could have fun with her! Admit it! I admit it! But I still find her ordinary. Sometimes fruit looks good, but that doesn't mean it tastes good. Leave Silvia alone, or I'll break your neck. Okay, okay, forget what I said. Chill out, that's just the first one. Normally he gets three. This drink isn't strong. I said this drink isn't strong! It's good alcohol. I almost finished it. It is really good. You drunk bastards! Aren't you ashamed? - Yes, sir. We're sorry. - Wait outside! Hey, girl! Hey, girl! Wait! Little one, wait! Come here! Wait, don't run! Don't be stupid. Now you're gonna know what it's like to have a big man. Don't move! Don't move! Leave this island immediately. And if you come back, I'll kill you! Do you understand? Leave! - Were you at Deer's Island? - Of course! Did you see the women who live there? They're old friends. - Listen to me, you idiot. - Go on. You're in danger, don't you realize? Death is waiting for you. Certain death. If you don't get rid of them soon, you'll die like El Pocho. I had a revelation. Listen to me, you'll die otherwise. You've been warned. Thank you, Andy. Wow! Look who's here, our dearest sheriff. How strange! You aren't into someone else's affairs. The one and only Raul Sebastian! What are you doing in this part of town? Occasionally, I like to remember the old times. I used to be scum, just like you. That's how I like to hear you talk. You know Alida, from the islet, right? Of course. A little bird told me you're courting her. Stay away from her, if you wish to keep breathing. And what are you gonna do? What a braggart! I'll do nothing. That's what friends are for. - No. - But dad! - No, my child! - Father! You know I only want the best for you. I've dreamed that you'd marry a hard-working, serious guy. - But I want Andy! - Well, I don't. - You're not going to marry him. - And neither are you. Father, why are you so stubborn? You never take my side. You're like your mother. She always did as she pleased, until one day she exploded like fireworks. But she was happy until she did it! Didn't she run away to marry you? Yes. - Then I'll run away to marry Andy. - Not a chance. - I'd accept that jerk before losing you. - Thank you, Dad! Hey, that's not what I meant! Damn it! - My love, it was good, right? - Yes, even though it was painful. - Was it painful for you too? - Yes, in the flesh! But the most important thing was to make sure I was the first one. Could you think anything else? You're the only one. I can't say the same for you. It's normal, men having previous adventures. I suppose you had great ladies, important women. Of course, like Paca, The Countess of Coneja, and Alida, a millionaire who owns her own island. - I've heard of her. - Who talks about her? - Crazy Oscar, the healer. - He knows nothing! He cured my warts. He says Alida is a witch, who seduces and bewitches men, and when she gets tired of them, she kills them. You're the only one who has bewitched me. That's why I'll marry you. You mean it? You aren't going with that witch? Of course not! She's just one of many! I already have the wedding dress. If you dump me for another woman, I'll kill you! C'mon, don't waste time. What do you want? Again, please. You have to take me home before 8:00. You know people talk. It's better if you leave now. My boss will be here sometime soon. Andy, why don't you leave this place? Why don't you leave Raul Sebastian? - I can't. - Why not? You can find another job. Everybody knows he's a murderer. I'm sorry. I couldn't say anything before, and please don't say a word to anyone. I'm Raul Sebastian's son. Do you understand now? I don't want to leave. Silvia! Silvia! - You were here! - Don't worry about the Jew's daughter. Any girl would be proud to be your wife. You have plenty to choose from. But I love her. Okay, okay, you'll have her. Even if you don't like it? I only want you to be happy. I told her that you're my father. That's why she left. You made a mistake. You shouldn't say anything to anyone, not even her. Nobody should know that Raul Sebastian has a son like you. Why? Are you ashamed of me? Do you want everybody to know who your mother is? Or my age? We're alike. Possessive, ambitious. Don't let words, or that girl, defeat you. Do what I always do, when one woman rejects you, look for another one to help you forget about her. If she closes her door of pleasure to you, there are many other doors. Never forget that! Are you still mad at me because I killed that man? I've always looked after you. I've always taken care of you. We're alone, and I'll never let anyone hurt or abuse you. Are you crying? You have no reason to! I couldn't let him abuse you, I couldn't. I don't want what happened 6 months ago, shortly after we arrived on this island, to happen again. I'll kill anyone who disrespects you! You don't understand, I can't allow everything to fail. Don't worry. Everything I do is for you. I can't allow anyone to lay a hand on you. I swear it will never happen again. You haven't noticed, Maria. You're pregnant. You didn't realize you're having a baby. Yes, and I'm protecting him. Do you understand now? - Do you love me? - I don't love you. What did you say? Don't you love me, you bastard? I've never loved you. I've never missed you. - I don't desire you. - Oh, really, you bastard? I don't like fucking you. I've never liked it. Very well, excuse me. What are you doing? C'mon! Keep doing it! - But you don't like it! What for? - I don't dislike it either. Damn it! Why I do have big emotions and a big cock? You know, I've been watching you for a while. Oh, really. I eat a lot! I'm leaving you all out of cookies. I'm not surprised, knowing you. I don't mind. I don't mind, you can eat the cookies, the eggs, and the beans. Thank you, this is enough. You don't understand, or maybe I didn't explain myself. It's hard for a man to understand certain things. I felt euphoric today, and I didn't know why. But now I understand, - seeing you there, eating. - What do you understand? I felt euphoric and happy because you're here. Because there's a man in the house. A reason to wake up and keep living. - By the way... - Hello! It gives us women stability and security. It doesn't matter if the man is uncouth or elegant. Nice, or a mess like you. It starts feeling like a serious thing. - I think you're overreacting. - No. Do you understand me, Maria? You women all dream too much. - Why don't you stay, Carlos? - Nah. Stay with us. If you were here with us, everything would be different, even this business. If I were here, it would be your ruin. Neither Raul Sebastian, nor other customers, would set foot on this island again. Maria, have you had breakfast already? You're getting too pretty. It seems the wildlife suits you. Let's go for a walk. The worst part about a sedentary life is becoming static. I'll turn slow and fat as a pig. And you, Maria, don't you get bored here all the time? Wouldn't you like to leave this place? One of these days, I'll take you to the city, and I'll buy you a thong, and then we'll go to the beach to show off. Well, I'll show you off, for sure. You're too hot. How are you, big man? Too proud to hook up with an imbecile? Were you spying on us? Yes, revolver in hand. Why didn't you shoot? I was about to, then Maria started moaning in pleasure, and I realized I have no right to deprive her of your services. - That's why you didn't shoot? - That's right. Perhaps you're in love with me. Me, in love? I don't know what that is. Don't lie! You're like other women, like everybody else. You love, hate, and all the rest. Did you have a good time with her? Poor thing, she's like a frightened animal. She needed it! How altruistic! Absolutely! More than you, anyway. You wanted to save your sister from being like you, so you kept her in the shadows. Yeah, so what? You should've asked her if she wanted to be a martyr and a virgin. - She can't tell. She's retarded! - She's mute! She's mute, but she's also a woman, like you! Better than you! - She's a little girl. - You're crazy, she's a woman! A pregnant woman. Carlos... I love you. - You shouldn't have come here. - I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. I was jealous of you two together. Why, Carlos? Why her? I don't know, poor thing. It happened so fast. She threw herself into my arms. Say you love me. I don't say those things! Say it! I don't want to. Leave me alone. You have no shame! I can't leave you alone. And you, with that big belly, but having a good time. I'm not mad at you. No, no. I'm not mad at him either. Such is life. Better you get off with him, than with any other man. At least Carlos is clean, and he smells good. He's a stallion, and handsome. I've always had a good time with him. But you already know that, you whore. You've heard us, admit it! Well, it's normal. You know what it's like. I have such an amazing time with him. It's been a while since I had a man like him. I must confess, I thought no man could make me come again. I've had many pigs in my bed, but you'll never know. I admit it, this one turns me on a lot. I wish we could keep him. It would be useful too. It's nice to have a good man by our side, and strong. Both of us could be pleased. And he's cute, right? Oh, a ship! Customers! Better get ready soon! Don't say she isn't elegant. She's like a countess. Have you ever seen a countess? No, but they have to be like her. Fantastic. - She's singing to me! - Really? - Yes. - I like it. - Let's go, Mr. Sebastian. - Thank you. Good evening! This place is closed. All of you out. - C'mon, everybody out! - C'mon, it's closed. Go. Get out. Was that for us too? Especially for you. - Communication is important. - C'mon, get out of here! I'll be back. Let's go. Goodbye. The boss is upstairs, he's waiting for you. Plenty of undocumented around here. What do you want? - I want to see Andy. - I'm sorry, he's not here. Wait! He hasn't called me in days. If he doesn't want to see me, at least tell me! I told you, he's not here. We never see him after work. Wait. Rufo, let her in. Come in. You haven't seen Andy in days? Four days to be exact. You mean since the last time you were here. So you knew we were in his room? It doesn't matter, he's madly in love with you. We had an argument because of you. - Is that so? - Yes. For real? My son is too important for me to joke about with you. - Don't you want us to get married? - No. And it makes me happy that he can be with another woman. I see. I'm sorry to disturb you. - Wait! Where are you going? - Why do you care? - What's wrong? - Nothing. - It's because of Andy. - It's nothing. I told you he's no good. Good afternoon, Leon. El Miserias! What are you doing here? I know you don't like me, but I'm here to warn you. A tragedy surrounds your home. I read about it in the coffee grounds. Be very careful. I don't believe in superstitions. That's not my problem. It's my duty to come here and warn you. Be careful with your daughter, she's in great danger. Hey Miserias, where are you? Is anybody here? Anyone? Is anybody here? Who are you? What do you want? You know very well who I am. Where's Andy? Andy? I don't know who you're talking about. And sorry to disappoint you, but you're not that famous. I don't have any fucking idea who you are, either. It's okay, my name is Silvia. I'm Leon Madero's daughter. I'm engaged to Andy, Raul Sebastian's secretary. You know who Raul Sebastian is, don't you? The name rings a bell. So your Andy is Mr. Sebastian's bodyguard, not his secretary. Don't be a jerk. Call him whatever you want, but where is he? He's come with Mr. Sebastian a few times, that's all I know about him. And if you lost him, search somewhere else. He could've run away with anyone. What do you mean? Are you saying that he's a playboy? A womanizer? He's a serious and respectful man! Serious because he rarely smiles, but he's like the rest of them. I don't believe you! I'm going to your room! - And if I find him... - You're not going anywhere! Get out of here now! Oh, really? Try to get me out! Get out! Out! And if you dare to come back to my island, you'll get a bullet in your head. Did you hear me? Out! Okay. But if I find out Andy's been here, or that he's been sleeping with you, I'll be back. It isn't that difficult to use a revolver. Oh, it's you! What are you doing here? C'mon, let's go, let's go. Don't worry. Andy. Andy! C'mon. C'mon, my child. I'm deeply sorry. Thanks. Let's go. Are you fixing the bassinet? Do you need some scissors? Are you okay? Do you hate me? Even if I sleep with him? Would you like us to leave this place? Me neither. And soon we'll have a baby. I know you don't like my work as a whore, but we have to survive. There is something I have to tell you. Everything I do, the bad and the good, I do it for you. You're the only person I truly love. And the baby in your womb too. You understand, right? I know you feel the same way. We need to stick together, no matter what. What are you thinking? If only you knew how to write! Sometimes I see fire in your eyes. I don't like it, I don't understand it. Alida! Where are you? Alida! Where are you, Mandanguita? Do you think we'll be able to leave this place someday? Escape from here? Don't be childish, I stopped dreaming long ago. We should hold onto what we already have. We have too little. I'm a whore, I escaped an arrest, and I take care of an idiot. You managed to avoid prison, and you're too beautiful. You make your living with your body, and you're lucky to have me, and to have a lovely sister. Soon she'll give birth to a baby that'll bring joy to our lives. Maria is an angel. I know you like her more than you should. Don't be stupid. Stop fantasizing. For better or worse, I feel sorry for her. So what? I'll sleep with her if I have to, like I did before, without any pleasure. She's dumb, scruffy, lousy. I have to think about you to come. But I don't care, as long as she's happy afterwards. I'm not jealous of your men. I don't think they matter to you. But Maria is different. She's younger than me, more attractive. All the men who come to me feel attracted to her. That's why you protect her. That's why you're capable of killing. It's not about love and mercy, just jealousy. Your excuse is being protective, while you're destroying her life. You're jealous of them liking her. No! It's not that! I don't know. It's not easy. I hate her sometimes! I punish her harshly, but then I regret it. I don't know... I don't know what's wrong with me. Please understand me. I'm wasting my best years caring for her, and she's useless. I don't understand her, and I don't think she understands me. It's like sacrificing my life for a selfish wild animal. Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! - No, Maria! - No! No! No! Alida! I have plenty of time to talk to myself. I play it over and over in my mind. I don't understand the facts or the motive, but perhaps that's just the way it is. They said I was lucky to survive. The truth is, I don't know. We searched for Maria's body for weeks, without any luck. She has to be somewhere nearby, perhaps sleeping in a bed of seaweed under the waters of these seascapes. Things have changed a lot since then. There are other lights, and new ships. And our boat looks like a corpse now, rusty and mutilated. Rusty and mutilated, like my heart. The evenings are too cold. I'm going back to my room, like I do every day, to wait patiently for the date that fate has set as the last and final in my schedule. And who knows, perhaps that day I'll see Maria again, wherever she is, deep in this sea, seemingly quiet around me.
