Oh, look at this little thing. (CACKLING) Oh no! (TENSE MUSIC) (SOFT MUSIC) It's rigged. The whole damn system is rigged against us. A month in prison for beating a racist? Come on, America. Sharia does better justice. Pulling a Muslim's beard. He should be flogged in public. Abid was right. When we occupy the White House it'll be by a true follower of Sharia. Insha Allah that day will come. Shalom. Kesselman, my co-worker, he doesn't work on Saturdays. I am fine but shouldn't I be treated the same? At work all I asked is five brief... Five brief breaks to pray and keep my faith. What's wrong with that? Hey! What the hell are you looking at? Look at her. She's not like that because she likes it. It's because someone screwed her chance in life. What the hell! Watch where you're going! Wear hijab! What happened Babu? Nothing. Listen. This country is melting pot. You have to adjust and adapt. Whatever the reason, I don't want to melt in it. Look Faisal, you choose your father's religion. No problem. Don't forget this is our country now, all freedom for us. My country is where my father is. So I'm right. (EMOTIONAL MUSIC) You are watching stupid videos. I don't want to lie to you. Son, please. I've tried to forget all these hatred. I can't.

But still I can't see my family now. He's following Allah's will. Look at young people around you. They are happy, they are working, making money and enjoying life. I'm not them. I don't like them. I don't want to be like them, period. Stop drinking. You look stupid. Hey! Don't talk like that! I'm your mother damn it! (CELLPHONE RINGING) Hello Renu. Hello papa. What is the time like there?

I re-took the Shahada. ABID'S VOICE: You're a true Muslim. How is he? ABID'S VOICE: Your father? He said to be careful in your country. It's a detour only so that the Americans don't become suspicious or anything. There's nothing in Kathmandu that I cherish. ABID'S VOICE: Keep listening to the song and keep fit.

Who are those thugs? I heard they've been harassing her for a quite sometime now. They do Abu's dirty work. It's a big mess in this city. And your grandpa has filed a law suit against Abu who's trying to grab this camp land. Children are always cause of worry for parents. Not you of course. Why has he come back now? Don't think of Bunty. Mr. Bhandari, What are you not telling me? Bunty is a dead man if he's not stopped. Get that.

When I said the masked murderer could be anyone, even a relative, I was wondering. Then I made the connection, and I thought Suresh Ji was a Hindu, an innocent Hindu, and he's a Muslim. A radical Muslim. That's a lie. The killer is here and he's hiding him. Americans are calling him person of interest. You know what does that mean? They think he's a terrorist. So, we should consider him as a terrorist too. Let's go! PUNDIT: Why don't you ask him what is he doing in Kathmandu. Is he here on a mission with Abu Mia!? That's a lie. This is you and police have to find out what is he doing in my country. I'm just making the connections. Bum bum bole! Bum bum bole! - Bunty! - Just be safe. Be safe, I'll be fine. What's happening? It's too late. He's going back to America. No, you listen to me inspector. No one can take him away. Bunty! Sher told me you like her. Good day, Pundit Ji. Good day. Bum bum bole!

I promised Suresh... You just be there. They're gonna deport him. What are we doing to do? LEILA: I'll explain to you. After you marry Faisal, no one can do anything, not even the Americans. So don't worry everything will be fine. Okay, I'll be there. (TENSE MUSIC) We are here to take your blessings Pundit Ji. Bum bum bole! Do you know why people like to hunt? Well, it's fun to kill an animal where it lives. And after killing it, if you eat the meat, oh, it tastes so much better. What are you talking about Abu? I'm just making the connection. Correct? I know, I know. This is your place, and I'm here. I am here! What can you do about it? When I said I listen to my wife, I wasn't lying. And you know what she said this morning? Don't trust a spineless person. Don't do anything stupid Abu. It will lead to a war this land have never seen before. (SMACK) I trusted you! I had faith in you! Ismail. Don't worry Abu. I take care. I take care. I like clear blue sky. No cloud. Not even puffy ones. (FRANTIC MUSIC) Leila wait! Go to the bureau and make sure the registrar is there. Where's the marriage bureau?
