BAYAN KO (My motherland - On a razor edge) Willy! Willy! - How are you, my friend? - Okay, you? Are you with the marchers? Yes. - Up to the converging point? - Maybe up to the Paco Bridge. So, how are you? Not good, still no regular job. I only work as extra in this jeepney, like two times a week. Three times. - It's a pittance. - How is Luz? - She's still in the hospital. - That's a long time. Almost two weeks. The baby is still in incubator. Is it bad? Yes. They said babies born prematurely after eight months are more in danger than babies born after seven months. Is that so. I didn't know it too. Let me say sorry for berating you before. It's nothing. I left those things behind and you were right then. Even so. But I was too much. It's alright. Forget about it. Okay. Got to go. - Okay. Take care. - Give my regards to Luz. - Don't forget. - I'll tell her. - You forgive me, yes? - Yes. Forget it. - Go on, you'll be left by the marchers. - We may not see each other again. - Is your application in Saudi approved? - No. Forget it. I will return to the province, in Samar. - Okay. You take care. - You too. Say hi to Luz for me. I Will. Amazing. He asked for my forgiveness though it's me who did wrong to him. - We'll all go out after work. - Are you coming? - You, are you coming? - You'll be in trouble with your wife again. Manny! Manny! Manny, come here. - Why? Did it stop? - I don't know. You're pushing the wrong toggle. Here, this is the right one. Hey, you've got to pay what you loaned from me. You're in trouble. Your girlfriend is looking for you last night. Let's watch Charles Bronson's movie later. Who's coming with us? Adyet and Rey will come. What about Luz? Will she let you? - Then I'll bring her with me. - That's goodbye good time for all of us. Just reason out nicely to her so she won't come. So we can have some good time. Load them up. Come now, hurry. This day is significant to all of us. In spite of the problems being faced by printing industry, in spite of the rise in printing cost and the shortage in the supply of paper and ink. We survive them all and made it to another year. We have many things to thanked for. God, first and foremost, for giving us this grace. Because He let us make this through to reach our 27th anniversary. Praise the Lord! And to all of who work here, many thanks. It is also important to thank all our satisfied customers. Many thanks! Thank you Mr. Lim for those inspiring word. And now, the next part of our program is the conferment of awards to the employees who have the longest years of service in our company. We would like to call again Mr. Lim and his loving wife, the beautiful Sally Lim to present the awards. Daddy, move here. First, our favourite lino-typist whom everybody calls Ka Ador. We call on Mr. Dominador Panganiban. Ka Ador come here! In recognition of his 20 years of honest service... - Ka Ador, congratulations. - ...to Jefferson Printing Press. This is a little salty. Who prepared this? Was it you? It should be sweeter. Where is the noodle? - What's wrong Luz? - This is nothing. Just a little dizzy. - Are you sure? - No, that's fine. - Maybe you're pregnant. - No Aling Fely. I'm okay. - Should I call for Turing? - No, no. - Wow. I think Turing got her this time. - About time! It's very obvious they wanted a child. Stop it. This is nothing. Are you okay now? Shall we eat? I've done everything. You must try Helen's diet. You know what? She lost 30 pounds. To a better tomorrow! Excuse me. - Daddy, how's everything here? - We're okay. Good. Enjoy. Excuse me. Turing, come. I have something to tell you. Turing, why are you here? You have food downstairs. Isn't it that you have your own party downstairs? Sure. But my friends are having conversations downstairs. They're grumbling. They say, why we have only beers and barbecue while here stateside drinks are served and... and... here you have cocktail hot dogs and cheese. I ask them: "Instead of complaining, go upstairs "taste hot dogs and cheese, "and imported drinks. "Anyway, "Mr. et Mrs. Lim are nice people. "And it's the anniversary of the printing press." Right? Yes, Turing. Mr. Lim himself told us that this party is for everybody. Right? Yes, thank you. But Turing, you have plenty of foods downstairs, right? - Yes, there's plenty. - Hugo, just a minute. Hey, Hugo, come here. Why is he here? - I have no idea. - He's drunk. Turing, that's empty. Let's go down. Wait. Let's bring this. - Turing, not that. You can only have beer. - Let's taste this. Bring him down. - We're sorry, Mrs. Lim. - What is there to be sorry for? - We're not doing anything wrong. - Let's go. We did nothing wrong, why are you apologizing? I did not do anything wrong. Mr. Lim, isn't it that you announced that this party is for everybody because it's our anniversary? Then why this? Sorry, Mr. Lim. - Don't take me for a fool. - Stop it, it's embarrassing. I did nothing! When I stand for myself, it's still embarrassing. Where will I stand? Turing, stop. Let's talk when we get home. Leave me alone! You want me subdued to your will. You want me to be submissive! Motherfucker! Bugoy, get some ice. Oh well, Turing is a piece of work, gets crazy when drunk. I thought he's a nice guy. Loving husband, responsible worker... Now I know, when boozed he gets crazed. Watch out, Aling Fely. He is piqued. You don't talk to each other until now? That's bad for couple. You'd better start talking to one another again. It's going to be hard for you to make mend. Turing! Turing! Hey, my friend! Lando, remember? I almost didn't recognize you. You've grown your hair. Kojak is out of style and I don't sport earrings anymore. - So, how are you? - How are you? Well, crazy as before. By the way, this is Boy. Shitboy, my partner in business. Boy this is Turing, the one I'm telling you about. My childhood friend until our teenage. - This is my wife, Luz. - Hi! - This is Boy... - Shitboy, buddy. What are you doing right now? I'm working in printing press. And you? I'm in buy and sell. - You look good. - Just getting lucky. Business is good. By the way, where are you headed to? We're going home. - Let's get some drink. - What? Come on. Indulge me, I have not seen you for a long time. Let's get some drink. - Come on, don't be ludicrous. - Okay, where shall we meet? Where can we fetch you? - Let's meet at Stop & Shop in Santa Mesa. - Good. My friend, I'm telling you, believe me, I have a chick here. Buddy, that's my chick. Who? That girl? She's heavy, man. Where? I'll go. I'm sorry, I have to attend to something. Just order what you like. Boy, take care of Turing. Don't worry about me. I'm good. I'll be quick. My friend, if you don't mind me asking, why do they call you Shitboy? It's a secret, my friend. - Luz, what you doing there? - Nothing. - Where is Turing? - He went out with friends. Ah, okay. Come here. Have a seat. Your show is great. By the way, Turing, this is Dhalee, my girlfriend. It's better that we're clear. You can look but you're off limit to her. Isn't she lovely? Show your tits a little bit so my friend can have a look. Love, I will leave Turing with you for a while. - I'll jerk myself a little bit. - What? I'll urinate. Wait here. I'll be quick. This is the first I see you. This is the first time I went out with Lando and Boy. Hmmm. You look decent. How did you end up with these thugs from City Jail? Dhalee, don't joke like that, Turing might think you for real. Are you also in Buy and Sell business? No. I'm Minervist in the Print shop. Minervist? What's that? It's like the machine I handle in the shop is called Minerva. And my name is Dhalee. Not Dolly, D-O-L-L-Y. Dhalee. Hey, wake up! Finish your food! Finish your chess, wake them up! Mr. Lim might see them. Finish playing cards. Hurry. You're too slow. Come on, hurry up, clean this. So I was with chick's house... - She's the new one? - Yes. - What's her name? - Forget the name, Ka Ador. Go on, Willy. So, tell us. Please pass the salt. So when I left the house. I was stopped by some thugs in the corner. They threatened me and told me not to come back. But do you want to see the girl again? - Now, that's the problem. - So, that's it. Wait. Isn't that you are going to Saudi? What's the connection between the chick and Saudi? Bah! If he's going to Saudi, what the use of seeing a chick here? Love is like that, Ka Ador. As if you've never been there. Wait, wait. Willy you have to settle the score with those thugs. So you can see your chick again. Are you thinking something bad, Turing? No. - Go home ahead of me later, Luz. - Don't do anything stupid. No. It's only for fun. I'll just work on something with Willy. We're police officers. Dude, who among these threatened you? Wait. I smell something. That's weed! I think it's better that I arrest you all. Don't move! - Get in the car. - I didn't do anything! You. You want to come too? Wait a second. I think this guy is tough. Maybe it's better to finish him off. No please. Have mercy. Have mercy on me! I confess. You see, he confessed. It's better to finish him off. - Please don't! - Sir, what forgive? - Please set him free. - This kind of people do not need pardon. He'll do it again and again. Go on, finish him! Sir. Sir, let him go! Be grateful that my friend is being nice, otherwise... - Sergeant, take the handcuff off. - Give me your hands! Go on! You're lucky, Willy is nice or else... Oi! Tell your fellow thugs not to touch my friend. Yes, sir. Or all of you will be in trouble. Understood? Yes, yes. Go ahead! Come on! Ask for forgiveness first. Do some obeisance. Sir... Forgive me, sir. That's enough. Go. Quick! Quick! He thought you're for real. Why? Isn't he for real? Oh. This one too? Come on. Let's go home. We just scare him for you so he won't bother you anymore. Get inside. Dude, we're so convincing that we tricked even Willy. You're crazy as ever! Turing! The guy was shit scared. - And even Willy fell for it! - I really thought he's a policeman. Turing, Luz fainted. What happened? Luz? Give her some space. I don't know how it happened. Oh well. You are pregnant again, Luz. - For how many times? - Third time. Twice, you already had miscarriage. I know. - How's my wife, Doc? - Your wife is pregnant again. - Really? For real Doc? - Yes. Happy? I know that you're desiring to have a baby. Sure, we've been waiting for four years already. You are ecstatic since it is not you who gets pregnant! Luz, here's your prescription. And make sure that you buy them all. You know how to take them, right? - Come back when you finish them. - Yes, Doc. - Hey, Turing, how you'd been? - Are you working today? Yes, I'm already late. - Go on. Get upstairs. - Mother. - Hey, Turing. - How are you? Why the surprised visit? Ana, Turing is here. Wash your hands, we're going to eat. Make sure you wash your hands before you eat. Go ahead and get yourself washed. Ana! Ana, Turing is here. Bah! This is unexpected. Why? Did you have a fight with Luz? Why, sister? Do I come here only when I have quarrel with Luz? By the way, where is she? She stays at home. She's complaining that she feels like in house arrest. Mercedes, get the dish. You? How are you, huh? Your wife is cumbersome when she gets pregnant. I have 5 kids already. Even when it's my due month, I can still work in the market. Because you're strong as a horse, sister. You fell for a college girl who is cultured and opulent. Even she's like that, she works very. Unlike your husband. You have 5 kids already, and he still not regular. There is no regularization in carpentry work. Not like you. Even if it's hard, we have foods to eat. And we are still able to support mother. Will you two stop that? You're unbelievable, Ana, it is rare that your brother is here and you start an argument. Seat down and let's eat. - Okay, let's go eat. - Give me the child. Sister is right, mother. Turing eat your food. Sorry mother, if I am not able to support you. I'm also in dire need. The medicines are too expensive. Don't worry about it, we get by. So why did you come here? Nothing. If you come here for money, we don't have any. Ana, please. Will you stop nagging your brother? Sorry, dude. You know me. You need not say a word if I can give it, but what you're asking is a big amount. No, it's okay, Tony. I'm just taking chances. I am really distraught on how to find money. Just for the medicines. Okay, bye. - Sorry. - It's okay. - Turing, give my regards to Luz. - Sure. If you need that kind of money, you are welcome to join us. What kind of sideline? Make us a map of the printing press and the house of your boss. If you can get the key, so much the better. You won't be involved. Your boss' looks can be deceiving, but I bet he's a millionaire. So if we can get our hands on the vault, we'll be rich. You stunned me... - I thought you're in buy and sell business. - It's the same shit. You know me even then. The break-ins and shoplifting, it's only for fun, right? In the beginning, yes. Then it becomes a way of life. When martial law was declared, I heard you were detained in Munti. Upon your release, I never heard of you. I thought you changed. Dude, in Munti, you will learn a lot of things, except conversion. Sorry, dude. I'm not cut to it. Okay. We misread you. Sorry. But if you ever change your mind, just let me know. - Can I talk to the boss? - He is busy. - Please. It's important. - Let me see. Hold on. Boss, Turing would like to have a word with you. Turing. Come. Come in. This is rush. Send it immediately. Sit down. Thank you. So, what's the problem? Er... It's about Luz. The doctor said Luz needs to stop from working so she will not have a miscarriage, because her womb is weak. She needs complete rest. It's not allowed for her to do heavy chores and to wobble in commute. She needs leave. If it's possible. Okay. Er... The prescriptions from the doctor... There are many and a bit expensive. But she assured us that if we really want to have a baby, we need... You know, Luz is only a casual here. - You know that. - Yes, sir. Meaning, I am not in obligation to give her sick leave or maternity leave or any other benefits. But I know that you're in need of money, so I will give Luz her full salary for this month. And I can promise you this: After she gives birth I will accept her again. I can only give as much, Turing. What now, Turing? Do you want overtime? Right? No, not at all. Here, take another one. Dude, do not think about your problems. That's nothing, right? Go on. Eat. Just eat. Did you notice Hugo... I'll take one. Did you see Hugo earlier? He's been with Mr. Lim nonstop. Fuck this life. You work like a horse the whole day and when evening comes... I may end up just like my father. He worked very hard all his life for the family. And he died prematurely. Let's not be loud, they might hear us. - Turing? Are you really okay? - Yes. - Just tired. - Dudes, are you done eating? - Watch out! It's slippery. - I know. I'm in a rush! The prices of these medicines are too much. Because they are all imported. I know. The thing is, it's only me who is working. Luz, what if you write a letter to your father? No way. Maybe these meds are cheaper in the States. Maybe they can bring us some. Or maybe a little dollar. Maybe they can send us a little dollar. The baby is coming out next month. We need a great deal of money. I said no way. - Get a loan from the office. - Give me coffee. Your disregard for one another is unbelievable. I think, he's just waiting for you. Maybe he wanted you to give in first. What he wanted is for me to fall on my knees and beg for mercy. You know father, he's an ex-army. He's tough and will not surrender. Just like his daughter. He is angry with me for two reasons. Firstly, I became an activist in college. Secondly, I choose a good for nothing person like you. Maybe if you did not run off with me, you'll be in the States by now. I'm sure you will be petitioned by your father. Maybe by now you're already an American citizen. Or maybe a teacher or old maid. Or a snob! Silly. Here. Thank you. My head. We can't do that. The doctor told us... It's not forbidden. Even so. I'm just afraid. The doctor said it's permissible. I just have to be careful. I don't want to, Turing, no. Who is it? Who's there? Wait a second! Wait! - Who's there? - Buddy, it's Lando. What's wrong? We're in trouble, buddy. Can you let us stay here for some nights? Until we can find a new hideout. It won't be long because we don't want you to be implicated. Well, only if it's okay to you. If not, I won't take it personally. Dhalee... Dhalee, hold on. Who are you? It's me, Turing. Remember, I was here with Lando and Shitboy. So what? Lando wanted to see you. I'm here to get you to him. This is the only cash I have. You didn't warn me. I will go to the bank tomorrow. - Oh, tomorrow is Saturday. - Friday. Oh, is it Friday? Then I'll go to the bank and will come back here. Buddy. I know you need it. - No. You need that more than I do. - Come on, don't be shy. No. I'm okay. Boy... - Lando, why did you choose this place? - Who's that? - Why don't you come to my apartment? - It's nothing. Let them be. Because you always have visitors. I don't have time to socialize with people. - Hey... - Go ahead. Next time, if you'll have to see me, send somebody who I know. I met Turing only once, my memory is not good. It's better to be sure. You may know somebody, but also to the cops. Nobody goes there to see me. I suppose the cops will not come to me because I don't know the guy who got caught. He's not going to rat us. Even if Paco is edgy, - he won't squeal. - I hope so. I hope so too. That's we can't take chances. Tomorrow, find us a new hideout. Why me? Who else? It can't be us. Lando, will you stop your racket? I will find you a new job. Bouncer in club. - Do I look like a bouncer? - Floor manager. Just find us a new place. Let's talk about that some other time. You're asking for an advance again? Isn't it that you just had one? I'm afraid you'll have nothing left on pay day. How can you pay for your balance? I know, sir, but I am really in a dire situation. Even with my overtimes, it's still not enough to buy the medicines. The medicines are really that expensive. Are you aware that there is an effort to organize a union in the printing press? Union, sir? Union. I heard that somebody is organizing a labor union. Are you not being approached by anybody? None, sir. You're not a member of the union? No, sir. Good. I will give you an advance, but you'll have to sign this. - What is that? - This is a waiver. Proof that you are not a member of any union. Come on buddy, let's eat. It's good that your shirts fit me and Boy. Coz we're just the same size. Your belly is a bit bigger though. - You're really funny, Turing. - Come. - Eat with us. - You go on. I'm indisposed. Sorry for that. It's her pregnancy. That's Dhalee. Let me open the door. - Where's Lando? - Inside. Did you find one? The place is nice. Quiet, but a bit expensive. You're really okay. I am pleased that you get it done so fast. They're a little upset at the club. I didn't go at noon. But it's infrequent. Buddy, at last your wife will have breathing space. Please excuse my wife's behavior, buddy. It's us who should ask for your pardon. Because of the trouble we caused you. No, it's nothing. Now that the food is ready... I think you've been followed. Who's there? Turing, Luz... It's Ka Ador and the others. - Wait a minute. - Turing... Just a moment, Ka Ador. Get inside. Hold on. Good evening, Ka Ador. Buddy, how are you? Come in. Hold on, I'll get more chairs. - You look beautiful. - You're teasing, Aling Fely. Aling Belen... Get inside, sit down. You're wet. - Willy, how are you? - Is the baby coming out? Next month. Dindo, Tony... - Here comes the chair. - Thank you. I'm okay. I'll just sit here. - So. What's going on? - Did you eat already? Don't bother, Luz. We won't be long. Besides, you can't feed us all. These people are ravenous. - How's everything in the printing press? - Well, it's the purpose why we are here. It's been a while that I did not see it... like six months? That's right. We haven't seen for some time. Your tummy speaks the obvious! What's the news, Ka Ador? Why, Turing? Didn't you hear anything? Why? Is there anything we should know about? Turing, it's not unknown to you about our situation in the printing press, right? Yes. In gatherings, the workers talk about their angst as they drink. We think that something is needed to be done. Not just discussion about misgivings. It is time to take action. Change will only be possible if we, the workers, will unite, will bond together. That way, we can fight for our rights. I never thought to deliver a speech could be this hard. He's holding it. I'll be straightforward, Turing. You know, we are organizing a union. And we would like you to join us. Here's the membership form. We can't recruit you, Luz, because your on leave. It's a pity. I'd like to join if it's possible. Don't worry, Turing. Mr. Lim doesn't know about it. Ah... We will recruit more. We will go house to house. We will single out each one, so we can get their support to the union. We will make sure that those who signed to be members will form the majority of the workers. You know, if Mr. Lim and Hugo hear about the union, they'll try to stop it. That is why we cannot be in the open yet. This is still a secret. Ka Ador, it's no longer a secret. Mr. Lim knows about this. He knows? Mr. Lim? Yes. He's the one who told me about it. It's me who is not even aware. What I am not sure of is if he knows who the leaders are. But he knew for certain that it is being organized. That bastard has a strong antenna. Maybe there is a rat in your group, Ka Ador. Or maybe someone who talks too much. It is now necessary that we speed up our recruitment. Oh well, Turing, are you in? Er... Ka Ador, you know me. I feel the same like you do. If there is one who should join first, it will be me. And my wife even more. But... I hope you'll understand me. Luz is pregnant. - If I lose my job... - Turing, does that mean... Don't worry, Ka Ador, I won't rat you. But I cannot join you. Turing, if it's me that you're worrying about... You don't understand, Luz. I already signed... How do you call it? Waiver? I already signed a waiver. Proof that I do not... that I am not a member of the union. Tony. - Tony. - What? Come here. Ka Ador, have you read this? "The following rules is now In force: "It is prohibited to have conversations "while at work, unless it is work related. "Three lates incurred within one month "will be punished with one week suspension. "Those caught urinating on walls will be fined twenty pesos." I received that too. Here. So this is it, Ka Ador? Don't we have a lawyer whom we can consult? Don't worry. I'll meet him tonight. That cannot be a policy. I have a feeling that they're just harassing us. That cannot be, Ka Ador. Will you let them do that? That's an abuse. Willy, do you know how to read? And you, Tony, get back to work! We're here to set the record straight. Aling Viring, Pepsi please. Here. I'll go ahead. Are you finished, Fely? Yes. Bye, Ka Ador. We'll go ahead. Let's go Chichi. Turing... Sorry about that. We're talking about union matters before you came by. Try to understand us. Send this quickly. Make sure of it. Okay. Are you serious? You outrivaled the boss. You come here any time you choose. Then make a deduction to my salary. Look at this smart-ass. Bastard. Here comes another one. It's the first day of the week and already late for work. It's already nine! Your application in Saudi is approved, that's why you're so bold to come late. Why do you always pick on me? So you're now insolent to answer! Don't go boorish on me. - I will fire you! - Go ahead. Try it! Bastard. Are you challenging me? - You dare me? - Try it. You just wait! Bastard! I will not fight you! Hugo, no! Hugo! Hugo, stop it! - You're an asshole, Turing! - Hugo, will you stop! Next time, you'll be fired! - Fuck you! - Stop it, Turing. - Looks like we're having fun! - Turing. Where are you going? - I'll just buy something. - Have a shot first. Okay, but just one bottle. Go on, buddy, continue. - Did you guy's play basketball? - That's why we're drinking! - Stop right there, buddy. - Why? You can't come in. Hugo's order. Why? He said you're no longer an employee here. You're fired. - Shit! - Sorry. I'm just following orders. Hugo! Hugo! Get out of there. Bastard! Lim! You're a bastard too! You can't do this to me! I have rights! You can't do this to me! I have rights! Hugo! You animal! Get out of there! Animal! Hugo! Lim! I can sue you for this! I'll file legal charges! Bastards! Get out of there! I'll file legal charges! Why are you all stunned? Get back to work! We need to plan what to do, right? - Let's prioritize with food. - And the supplies as well. Correct. - Make sure you... - Ka Ador, don't forget the notice of strike. I'll handle it. I will talk to the lawyer so we'll know what to do. List them all. Who will bring it? - What about sleeping bags? - Who is going to bring it? I will bring it. - Do you have any permit? - Yes we do, boss. Right here. Stay at the side. Tell the others do not block the way. Move. Move. Don't obstruct the way. Everybody stay at the side. Go on. At the side. Stay at the side. Everybody stay at the side. Friends, we are calling the attention of the military and the police. Their loyalty should be with the Filipino people. They should serve the Filipino people with honor and dedication. We are calling them to defend democracy. In the end, we are all Filipinos! Luz would have been here. But what can I do? Will I get money if I join the march? Can demonstration solve my problem? This is what Mr. Lim promised: All who will work will receive a bonus. Especially you: You're not a union member. No trade unionist, no striker. Look at me, buddy, I am a union member but I know that it's not right to wage a strike. Under the new law, you have to file first a notice of strike and you cannot go on strike immediately after. We need to wait for 30 days as cooling off period. That is the requirement of the Ministry of Labor. When no solution is reached within 30 days, that's the only time the strike can be legal. He's hard-headed, Ka Ador, and does not believe me. Maybe they got infiltrated by subversives and agitators. You're not alone on this, Turing. It's not just us. There are others who will also work. What you will do is not illegal. You can't be branded as scabs. Under the new law, any worker who does not want to participate in the strike has a right to work. He can pass through the picket line and should not be stopped. Turing, the strike has gone for 3 days. For 3 days you're not earning money. It's all up to you. Luz will deliver the baby next month. Turing, I need to talk to you. - Give me a second. - Wait, Turing. Talk it over with your wife. But remember, Mr. Lim's offer is for your own good. - What? - Don't tell me you'll be a scab. Those who will work are not scabs, it's the strikers who are illegal. You believe him? Did you talk to Ka Ador? Did you consider their side? What happened to you, Turing? First, you signed the waiver without informing me, then, you did not want to join the union. You did not participate in the strike and now this? - I did not make any decision yet. - And you have to make a decision now. Tell Hugo and Binggo, that traitor! You're due next month, Luz. If it's me who is troubling you, then okay, I will yield to my father. I will make a long distance call. I will ask for help. Go ahead! I will not stop you. Do what you want! Why do you sound irritated? Do you want me not to stop you in your plan as well? It is very hard to lose job nowadays, Luz. So you are afraid to lose your job, but not to let criminals stay in your house? Luz... Luz, I don't mean it. I don't mean it, Luz. Luz... Luz? Luz... Luz... Are there no alternate route? We'll take a short cut. Hold on. There are too many vehicles. Come on, Luz. Hang in there. - Hang on! - Turing... Hang on, Luz! Hang on! - He's forcing me to have a date with him... - Miss. - Miss. - What? Emergency! Emergency? What happened to her? Motherfucker. Can't you see that she's bleeding? - Don't get mad. I'm just asking. - Where's the emergency room? Unbelievable. Bring her all the way down. Where's your deposit? Later! - Where's the emergency room? Quick! - End of the hallway, to the right. - What just happened? - I have no idea. He comes shouting. He said it's emergency. Turing! How is Luz? She's safe. Thank God! Your sister would like visit but I brought your nephew instead. This way. I'm sorry but no visitor is allowed here. Turing, how's the baby? He's weak. He's only eight months so he has to be incubated. For how long? They said maybe two months. Jesus... Where will you get the money? Let's wait for Turing. This one's late... - Sorry. I came from the hospital. - Sit in front. Hey, the delivery van is coming. Maybe that's Hugo and he's late. Comrades, you know the law. Ka Ador, they have scabs with them. Comrades, comrades! They are scabs! Don't let them through! Lock arms! - Don't let them pass! - Hold one another! Lock arms! You cannot enter, motherfuckers! Hold on. Hold on! Let them through, please. What you're doing is a violation against Labor Code. I could have already arrest you. You don't have a permit to stage a strike. - But we do have a permit. - I know. I know. But that's not yet in effect. According to the Ministry, it is still cooling off period. So, please, don't make angry. Otherwise I'll arrest you all and have you detained! This is bullshit! So this strike is good for nothing. - Go ahead, detain us if you want! - Willy, stop it! Major, I apologize. He's just a junior. Come on, please, listen to me. Don't make me mad. Give way. Step aside. Go on let them through. Go on! Don't make me mad! Turing! You motherfucker! Scab! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! When the paper flips over, push this. Then make another round. Understood? You press here, you turn here. - There. Now it runs smoothly. - Yes, sir. What's that? It's mangled. Fix that. Yes, sir. Turing! Turing! Give this to Hugo. Tell him it's urgent. It's good that you did not think of joining the strikers outside. It's good that you used your brain this time. Go ahead, eat! Did you know that Mr. Lim is planning to give you all a bonus. Look at those outside. Oh well, Turing, those outside will starve and will not get any bonus! Oh, with everything that is happening, my blood pressure is taking toll. Turing, maybe tomorrow, Hugo will be the one to supervise you. I have a plan to go on vacation with Mr. Lim together with the kids. The kids are getting neglected and fail to go to school. Hey, Binggo, come. Senyang, Constancia, you two will prepare their foods while I'm gone. My country is the Philippines, land of gold and flowers. Love in the palm of her hands, giving beautiful virtue. In it's modesty and beauty foreigners became interested. My country, you're subjugated plunged into despair. Birds that are free to fly, cage them and they will cry. What more of a country so pure that it would not desire to be free. My treasured Philippines, home of my tears and torment. My dream is to see you free. Are you okay? How sweet it is to live in your own country, where no one is a slave and where there is freedom. My country in chain will rise tomorrow. The East will shine red in the sweetness of freedom. Binggo! Binggo, wait! Where are you going? - I quit. I'm going home. - Why? I can't stand it anymore! Binggo! What are you doing? Stop! They will kill you! Stay here! You are just a girl! Leave him alone, Hugo! Hugo! Tony, Rey, look: Jeeps are coming. The headlights are off. Willy, wake up! Wake up! All of you, wake up! Go on! Now, set them on fire! - Turing! Turing! - Motherfucker! Turing, there is a commotion outside. Ka Ador... Make way! Animal! Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers, fuck you all! Back off! Back off! Cowards! Come back here! Cowards! Ka Ador! Ka Ador! Ka Ador! The Filipinos are in line to fight injustice and repression. - Give my regards to Luz. - Will do. It's okay. Are you sure, buddy? Am I forgiven? Forget it, my friend. I told you I forgot all about it. We may not see each other again. Is your application in Saudi approved? No. Forget it. I will return to the province, in Samar. You take care. Bye. Do you have this? Hold on. We don't have it. - Try the other store. - Okay. How much? 156,40 pesos, sir. Is it possible... to get half of each? Yes, sir. Is he okay? That's it? - He's not coming back to the incubator? - Not anymore. Baby... - He takes after his father. - He's already sleepy. Maybe later. I want to cuddle him. - Oh, I saw Willy just now. - How is he? He's okay but he will go back to their province. I thought they will file charges against Lim. I did not ask. That Mr. Lim is clever. Anyway, that's the tactic of the capitalists: They will close the company when in strike. When the situation cools off and the strikers get disheartened, they will open again, but with a different name. It's not your problem anymore, Luz. What about Aling Fely and the others? They should push the case. It may take a long time but in the end they may win it. Don't concern yourself about it. We have our own problems to deal with. Here. Your medicines. I bought only half of each coz we don't have money. Here's another problem. - What is this, mother? - The hospital bill. Everything is there: Anesthesia, doctor, dextrose. Turing, don't worry. I will write to father. Don't worry, he will forgive us... maybe. I hope for the sake of his grandchild. - Turing... Turing! - Where are you going? - Where is the chart of Mrs. Reyes? - Let me see. Here, doctor. - Er... miss... - Yes? Can I take my wife and my baby home? Name? It's Manalastas. - Manalas... - Luz Manalastas. The one whose baby got incubated. Manalastas, yes. Wait a second. She's ready for discharge. Did you pay your bill already? Er... The problem is... not yet. You have to pay first. The cashier is on the ground floor. Go there and pay your bill. They will give you discharge slip. Then come back here so I can sign it. Because you need the discharge to show the guards before you leave the hospital. Miss... Er... The problem is... I have no money to pay. Er... Is it possible that I get them out of here then I will pay later? It's not possible. That's not the policy here. No hospital has that kind of policy. But, miss, the thing is, the longer they stays here, the higher the bill will be. What's the problem? He wanted to bring home his wife but has no money to pay for the bill. There's nothing I can do. Sir, we really cannot do anything. That is the policy here: You have to pay first. - We're just following the policy. - And if I don't have the money to pay? We are just nurse here, mister. There is nothing we can do. Maybe it's better that you go to the director, the director of the hospital, Dr. Santos. Talk to him. Where can I find him? You go straight down, then you turn left. Thank you. Miss, where can I find Dr. Santos? His office is right there but he is on leave. Why, sir? I'd like to talk about this. Oh... Manalastas? Yes, I will ask him if I can bring my wife and baby home. Because I cannot pay that in full. We do not have that kind of policy here. It is better if you talk to the officer-in-charge, Dr. Fernandez. Where can I find him? Go straight then turn left to the Administrator's office. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Miss... - Where is Dr. Fernandez? - He's not here. - Where is he? - He's doing his round but he will be here. Please sit down first. - Dr. Fernandez? - Yes? Good afternoon, Doc. Can I talk to you for a while? Come in. So what? It's about Luz Manalastas, my wife. The one whose baby got incubated. Oh, yes. They are staying almost two weeks here already. The longer they stay here, the higher the bill gets. Of course. What do you want? I would like to ask for permission to take them home. Then I will pay the bill later gradually. Mr. Manalastas, please understand us. This is a private hospital. We do not receive any subsidy from the government. The hospital needs to make some money so we can continue servicing the patients. Now if there are patients like you who will not pay... I will pay, Dr. Fernandez, I am not a charlatan. You can make me a promissory note and I will sign it now. All I want is to take my wife and the baby for reason that my bill gets higher as they here longer. Mr. Manalastas, I cannot change the policy of the hospital just to accommodate you. So please, understand us. I will pay the bill little by little. If you want, I can work here even without salary until I paid everything. Dr. Fernandez, please listen to me. Mr. Manalastas, we are not employment agency. We cannot do that. Dr. Fernandez, you are wanted at the emergency room right away. I'll be right there. Excuse me. Dr. Fernandez, wait. Listen to me. Doc, I'm begging you. Listen to me. I am not a swindler. Dr. Fernandez, listen to me... Guard, hurry up! I'm begging you. Please, approve. I will pay. - Hey, let's go. - I'm talking to the doctor. Stop it, mister! I cannot change the hospital policy just to accommodate you. Doc, please wait. Wait! Doctor! Doctor! Stop! Stop will you! I am only asking... Because... Where's the baby? Back to the nursery. Where you've been? I went to the administrator. I asked them if I can take both of you home. Then? Nothing. They did not approve it. They said I have to pay. Dress up. Mother, help Luz to dress up. - Why? Where are we going? - We'll escape. - What about the baby? - We will take him too. The jeep is outside. Mother, help her. Turing. No. Not this way. There is no other way, Luz. Come with me. We will escape. Baby check, Mrs. Manalastas. Good afternoon. Are they following up to here? Why are you following me? Mr. Manalastas, we're just doing our jobs. We're just following orders. Turing, where are you going? Perform a miracle. - Turing! - Turing! Here we go again. Why did I take this road? Go on. Make some noise! Get noticed! Miracle... How does one perform a miracle? Boss... Good evening. - Is Dhalee here? - She's no longer here. Do you have an idea where she transferred? Try to ask the other dancers. They might know where. Thanks. Hurry up, Carla. Carla... - Who are you? Leave me alone! - Wait, Carla. They say you are Lando's new girlfriend? Lando Bonoan? I do not know any Lando. Let me go! Don't deny it, Carla. Lando's old pals told me everything and friends of his ex-girlfriend too. Believe me, Carla, I'm Lando's friend. We grew up together. I'm not a cop. I won't put you in trouble. - I really need his help. - I told you I don't know him! Let me go. How did you get here? You bitch. You will bring me to Lando. Move! Wait! - Are you here to make trouble? Huh? - Stop it! Stop it! Carla, I am not looking for any trouble. I just really need Lando's help. Who are you with? He said he's a friend of Lando. Is he alone? Yes. Let's go. Hello, Carla. - Buddy, how are you? - Hello, Boy. Where's Lando? Hey, sweetheart. Turing! How are you? I'm okay. We're you properly introduced to my new sweetheart? - Yeah. A while ago. - This is Carla. Her body parts are awesome, buddy. You're looking for me, why? What is it? Nothing, mother. What about Turing? Has he returned yet? Not yet. Turing... Boss... What else? That one. Turing... - There are cops outside. - Move back. Boss, there are cops outside. Go. Hurry! Boy, there are cops. Let's go! What are you waiting for? Downstairs. Jimmy! There's a way out backdoor. Let's go! Take this. Open it. Hurry! Close the door! Lock it up! Let's go! Slow down... Turing... Upstairs! But... - What about Boy? - There's nothing we can do. He'll just slow us down! Boss... - Don't leave me here. - Or it's the three of us! - Boss... - Here's some bullets. You're on your own. - Boss Lando... - Turing, come here! Turing, don't leave me here. Turing, what are you doing? Let's go! Turing, don't leave me here. Let's go! - Turing... - Sorry, Boy. Stay where you are. I'm the owner here. I am Mr. Lim, the owner here. Sir, what happened? - There was a shootout inside. - Shootout? Take cover! Take cover! - What about my wife and my kids? - I don't know. Get out! Get to the living room. Move! Hurry! Stay at the sofa! Hurry! Sit down! Sit down! Turing... Why Turing? I did not do anything wrong to you. Go on! To the living room! - What did we do? - Go on! Sit down! Turing, to the window. Have mercy... Be quiet! Silence! Stop! Don't move closer! Or I will kill her! We have hostages inside! Including children! So don't... ...force your way in. Tell the others too not force themselves to get inside or we'll kill everybody here! Stay where you are! Close the gate! Close the gate or I will kill her! Go away! And remember: I am not bluffing! Move away. Listen everybody. Be careful with this operation. Do it as planned. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. Your troop will go here. And yours, here. Adjutant, if you want I can lead them backdoor. - I know this place. - Alright. Go ahead. As we continue our live report about the hostage drama which started two in the morning, here, at the Jefferson Printing Press. The authorities granted the demand of the suspects that we be allowed to get inside the house of Mr. Lim. Here on, we can report about the conditions of the hostages that include the wife, two children and two house helpers. Arturo Manalastas, a former worker of the printing press... It's Turing... ...will give us an account about... Turing, are there anything else? They should let my wife and my baby go! They did nothing wrong. Also... Also... The workers who went on strike here, why is the case still pending? When will it end? They have to decide on the case. They should... give justice to the strikers here! They should... The government should give them jobs... all of us! All I ask for is a decent job, so that I can get my wife and my baby out... so I can pay the hospital. Also... So that... he should be... incarcerated! Mr. Lim should be incarcerated without eating, then he will know what a worker is going through. They should give us... amnesty, - me and my colleagues. - Enough! - Enough, stop it! - And... What are you talking about? What we need is a vehicle. So we can escape. Give us a safe pass! That's all our safety, in exchange of the safety of the hostages. Not with all this bullshit! We are again here outside in front of the Jefferson Printing Press where the hostage drama is taking place. A while ago, we were inside the house of Jefferson Lim and got an exclusive interview with the suspects, Arturo Manalastas, a former employee of the printing press, and his two companions... Do you know Turing Manalastas? Not quite. I saw him once. You're not around when it happened? No, no. So where were you then? We were at... Where were we? We had a late dinner. Miss, how long have you known Lando Bonoan? Barely two months. To continue our report, we will interview the former workers of the printing press. Your name please? Mrs. Felicia Ramos, sir. Aling Fely, according to what we have learned, you are a former official of the union... I was the vice-president. And one of the hostage taker is a member of your union? No. Not Turing. He did not even join in our strike. But Turing is a nice guy. If Arturo Manalastas is a nice guy, what do you think made him steal and take hostages? I think what he is asking for... is the same thing that we want here. A little justice. What? Louder please. A little justice, sir. You, where are you going? - My husband is inside. - He's my son. Who among them? One of the hostage taker. - Reyes, accompany them. - Come with me. - Eat. - I don't want that. I want rice! That's Luz. - Who is she? - Turing's wife. We have learned that the wife of Turing Manalastas is here. Sir, this is the wife of Arturo Manalastas. I am his wife. I would like to talk to him. Missis, stay here for a while. We'll call his attention. Give that to me. Arturo Manalastas, listen carefully. Your wife and your mother are here. They'd like to talk to you. I repeat: Arturo Manalastas, your wife and your mother are here. They'd like to talk to you. Here, Missis, you can talk to him now. Turing... Turing, this is Luz, Turing. I beg you, Turing, listen to me. What you're doing is not right, Turing. You don't have to do this. You have to surrender, Turing. Just do this for me. And for the sake of our baby. Turing, please, answer back. Answer back, Turing. Turing. Turing, my son, this is your mother. Surrender yourself, my son. For my sake and your family, surrender yourself. What you are doing is a grave sin against God. Turing, you don't have to do this. I already wrote to my father. I already wrote him. I'm just waiting for their answer. But I'm sure, they will help, Turing. I'm sure of it. I will go inside. I will come to you, Turing. Buddy, no! Don't let her get in. Tell her it's not possible. - You have to think, Turing. - But we let T.V. people In. It was you who let them in. It was you who wanted to be a star. Motherfucker... Okay. Okay. I agreed to it. We took chances. I'd like to talk to you. Let me in. I'd like to talk to you. It's only a bait, buddy. So that you'll go soft. Nothing can stop me. This could be the last time that I'll see her. Buddy, she wants you to surrender. You heard it? It's only a bait! I beg you. Whether you like it or not, I will come to you. Everybody. Stand by. Be careful, missis. Please, don't follow her. Right now, Mrs. Luz Manalastas is about to enter the printing press. She's headed for the place where are her husband, Turing Manalastas, the other suspects... ...and the hostages. Luz Manalastas, also a former worker of the printing press, will try to talk his husband to surrender... Turing, Open the door. I beg you. Hold this. Let me in, Turing. Come here! Stand up! I said stand up! Turing, open the door! Move out! Come on, outside! Listen! Listen carefully! I'm armed! I have a hostage! If this is a trick, I will blow Mrs. Lim's brains out! - You hear me? - Please... Turing, for the sake of our child... I did this for your sake. And for the sake of our child. Have you gone mad? Let's give ourselves in, buddy. The officer said there's nothing we can do. To you, maybe. How about me? If you don't want to, that's fine with me. But as for me... You motherfucker... We came in here together. We'll get out together. Listen Lando... - Stay out of this! - For the sake of our child! That's my wife! Don't touch her! Help! No, don't... Don't... Turing, please, don't... The two children of Mr. Lim are now safe outside the printing press embraced by their father. And the two house helper as well. Also at this moment, Luz Manalastas, the wife of Turing, is being escorted out and is received by her mother-in-law. They are crying while tightly embracing one another. Later, we'll try to make an interview to get information on what happened inside the printing press and the house of Mr. Lim. Meanwhile, we'll try to... Turing Manalastas is also being escorted out of the printing press... Give way! Step aside! He is in handcuff and is being guarded by the SWAT team. It is possible that the suspect will be boarded on a patrol car. Bastard! Go to hell! Turing! Turing! There had been a commotion and a shooting here, outside of the printing press. We can see the body of Turing Manalastas full of blood lying down on the side of the building. Meanwhile, the people outside are in chaos due to the recent happenings. The police are trying to stop the crowd and the media people from getting near the area. We can see right now the body of Turing Manalastas being cradled by her wife who continuously cries the death of her husband. Meanwhile, relevant to what happened here, according to the information we get. The wife of Mr. Lim is one of the casualties, together with one of the suspects inside the printing press. We have also learned that a team from the law enforcers are studying some details of this tragic incident. We have also just learned that apart from the first two victims, another person was killed in the shooting in the printing press. A fourth victim...
