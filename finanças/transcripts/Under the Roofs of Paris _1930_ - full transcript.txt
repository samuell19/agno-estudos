Words and music, one franc. This charming lady will sell you the song with a smile. Give 'em a big smile. I'll sing it first, then we'll do it all together. Music! When a man's alone Living on his own Life is monotone When it's time for lunch The guy's in a crunch He doesn't care to munch The local restaurant Is no place for detente He will barely stay For a cafe au lait He's throwing his health away It's not like that when you're in love That's when you become a gourmet Bring on the cake, my love The pastries and the sundae Sometimes she invents Desserts with weird contents Your stomach can make a faux pas Oolala! But she says to you so sweetly "I can't take another bite!" But stuffs you so completely That you begin to turn white But if you get sick She says: "You eat like a horse. You have no remorse" Love's a charming course! Now let's hear it. All together now. Give me a song. Thank you. Let's take it from the top. The fat guy got it. You were scared. Who, me? I'll show you.

What do you want? -Let me by. -No. Albert! Albert! "Albert" He's gone. Lucky him! I want to talk to your friend... the singer. Albert? Know where he lives? Sure. Come over here. Emile, I'm getting married. I advise you to stay away from the kid. Quit hanging around the women I like. Fred. Who is it? Open up. Who is it? In the name of the law I'm not falling for that one again. Police: Open this door! Lay off me. You can wait. I'll break the door in. -That's enough! Get lost. -This is too much. You're in for it! Go get the locksmith. Go! Is all this yours? No, it's not mine. Hey, kid. Come here. -Can you deliver this note? -Yes. Where'd it come from? Someone left it here. Who? You won't talk? -Understand? -Yes. Go on. How nice. An early morning visit. Your friend Albert just got arrested. What? I hid the case at his place. They found it. How do you know? I was walking by his house, and I saw some detectives taking him away. We should get out of town. Yes. For a while, anyway. Your friend Albert... Have you had any news? No, they wouldn't let me see him. How long has he been in prison? Fifteen days Your friend didn't know the contents of the suitcase? Of course not. He knew nothing. You carried out this robbery with an accomplice. Where ya been for the past month? I took a little trip. Leave me alone! You haven't changed. Not glad to see me? - Where have you been? - On a trip. I'd better go find her. Don't bother. She'll come back on her own. Come to the dance? -Not tonight. -Why not tonight? Got a date? No. In that case... Come on. Hello, Albert. Hello, Pola. Won't you dance with me? Hey, you... I hope you'll behave now. I forbid you to look at her. Or else... And now... Step outside, if you're a man. As you like. Louis! -He's fighting Fred? -Don't go, Louis! Louis... If you go, take this. I don't want any. Say... Admit it, you're scared. Okay, let's drop it. But keep out of my sight. Got it? You guys coming? Fred! I didn't say good-bye. Good-bye. Did you see two guys run by? We didn't see anyone. Albert. I didn't know you loved her. - I don't. - Neither do I. You dope! Stay here. - You win. - Are you kidding me? You fell for it? Couldn't tell it was a joke? I never gave Pola a thought. Go ahead and kiss her. Pola, meet your fiance. Not bad. Let's take it again. And you, miss? It's free today. But you'll sing with us. All together now. THE END
