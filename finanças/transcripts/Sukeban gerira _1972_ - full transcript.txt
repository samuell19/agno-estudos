Where ya headed? Let's hang out. - Move. - What's your problem, bitch? Say something! You chicks are hot! Come hang out with us. Damn it. You're good on those bikes. Where you headed? Kyoto or Osaka? What's it to you? Don't act so tough. You're good-looking, babe. Wanna see what we're all about? I'm an " Easy Rider.'' Come on. Ow, crap! Get lost. Don't mess with us just 'cause we're chicks. I'll mess with you, all right! You bastard! Boss! You sure are carefree. From Shinjuku to Kyoto and we're broke. - That was rough. - Yuki. It's your fault for saying we should go to Kyoto. Don't be such a drag. Kyoto's where I was born. It's a big tourist spot. The Gion festival is coming up. Lots of rich tourists around. We need to drum up some money. Let's split up. What are you doing? You're making me dizzy. Don't do that. You think I'm a top or something? Please stop it. I'm begging you! You're weird, girl! Please don't do this, please! I'll show you some good places in Kyoto. Get on. I know all the good places. I've lived in Kyoto for 30 years. Get on, I said. How can I? I can't sit on a girl's bike without knowing her. - Get on! - Okay. What are you going to do? My ancestors' grave is here. Come on, I'll let you do me. How can you offer yourself like that? It's startling. I won't be able to get it up! You'll be fine once I turn you on. Hurry up. This is nuts! My wife died only a month ago. I can't have sex near her grave. - Having sex near her grave - - That's exciting. Too bad you don't want to screw me. Give me your money, old man. - I don't have any. - I gave you a peek. What are you doing? That's my money for a trip to Taiwan. You'll spend it on chicks anyway. That hurts! Balls! No more nukes! Sign our petition. Make a donation. Please help out. Here's 1 0 yen. No more nuclear arms or testing. Sign and donate. Aid the fight. I got a handful. You're honeymooners, right? Snuggle up closer. Okay, big smiles. Great. You make a nice couple. Let's go. - Thanks very much. - Give me 1 00 yen. You asked a favor. - But you offered. - Give me 1 00 yen. Congratulations. Ukko, you making any money? Nope, no locals around. How about you, Yuki? Not bad. Now you got me worried. Guess I'll have to use my last resort to bring in some dough. Anybody good around here? I'll do the old man. Ukko, I'll tell you again. Take him to a hotel and just before he sticks it to you, grab his nuts and squeeze them to bits. You gotta take his money without actually having sex. I can do that. Grab his nuts and squeeze, right? Gramps. It's still light out, so it's kinda hard to ask. Wanna get it on? I'm so horny, it's not funny. I'll give you a deal. How about a fiver? You wanna charge money? Come on,just 5,000 yen. I only sleep with girls I love. There's gotta be love and understanding. - How about 1 ,000 then? - 1 ,000? Deal! You're quite a number, Gramps. Grab his nuts and squeeze them to bits! And squeeze them hard! Squeeze them to bits! More, Gramps! I'm gonna come! Gramps! Ukko, how long you gonna be like that? Snap out of it. I'm such a loser at this. I always forget about the money. Yuki, is there a girl boss in Kyoto, too? Yup. Hey, they're shaking down some high school students over there. Stop it. Hand over the money you made. - What hole did you crawl out of? -Just hand it over. How dare you, bitch! I'll take you on, one-on-one! Come on! - All right. - Boss. This is my turf, I'll take her on. I was born and raised in the west. They called me Speedy Yuki. I'll take you on, one-on-one! You bitch! We're the Shinjuku Red Helmet Gang. Remember that. Yasu. You all right? So, you're the punks throwing your weight around Kyoto. Our boss wants to see you. Come meet her. I'm from the imperial capital, Kyoto. I'm the head boss of the girl gangs here. And I'm boss of the Kyogoku group. I'm Rika. I'm Tatsumi, the boss of Kujo. - I'm Nobuko. - Kazuko, the boss of Ginkakuji. Thank you for the introductions. I was born in Chigasaki. As fate would have it, in the sea of neon lights, the Shinjuku area ofTokyo, I became the head of the Red Helmet Gang. I'm the gang leader, Sachiko. You're messing with my turf, and I won't let it go. You knew it would come to this, didn't you? Kyoto's reputation is on the line. The girl gangs will take you on. You talk the talk, but that's about it. I'll gladly take you on. But if I win, Kyoto will be my turf. Don't mouth off until you win. One-on-one. Shit! Bitch! Crap! You little - This turf is mine, and I'm the new boss. Any complaints? Speak up now! That's not fair! No Tokyo bitches are taking us over. Right, girls? That's against the gang code. The fight was supposed to settle this. Quit whining. That's just the way I do things. All right. Then let's get it on! Knock it off! It's Nami. Nami came back. Nami's back. When did you get back? just now, on the bullet train. That music from the Gion festival sure brings back memories. Rika, stop this stupid fight. - Yeah, but - - Save your excuses. I've been watching you from up there. The reason I let you take over as boss is 'cause I had high expectations for you. You win. Do whatever you want. How do you do? You have a good code of ethics. I overheard you just now. I was born and raised in Kyoto. I went astray at age 1 5. I'm a lone wolf. They call me " Gion Bayashi'' Nami. Nami? Nami, did you come back to shame me again? You took off on me. You shamed me. I was about to give you to the boss. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I'm your little sister. A sister who disgraces her brother is no sister of mine. Get out of Kyoto. I'm not taking orders from you. I'm telling you, get outta here! No chance. You're still as stubborn as ever. just go, Nami. Nothing good will come of you being here. Doesn't matter. This is my hometown. Stupid bitch. I'll let everyone keep their turf. Meet here once a week, and report back to me. If anyone betrays me, even a little, they'll pay for it. Don't worry. Once we make a deal, we don't betray our people. Got that, Rika? Loud and clear. I've never seen you gals before. I'm Sachiko, the new boss around here. You taking Rika's place? Fine by me. I'm Nakahara, with the Tsutsui gang. We oversee the girl gangs. just don't forget to pay your dues. Don't mind if I do. Upsy-daisy. Damn! That's my bike! Come back here, you nun! Linda, ride with me. - Stop, punk. - All right. Stop right there, baldy. Pull over, punk. - Ouch! - My bike's busted! That hurts! Somebody take me to a doctor. Any doctor, it doesn't matter which. Please, it hurts! OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST Am I really okay? Of course,just shut up. You're overreacting, whiner. How can I help you? - Doctor. - Thanks for seeing us. No problem. Leave it to Dr. Hachiro Takemi, future chairman of the Medical Association. Well, well, a nun. I've never had a nun for a patient. Shaved head and everything. Hideous. Stop whining. Let's get started. Yuck! You're bald up top, but super hairy down below. You should get it cut once in a while. Guys don't wanna look at this. Now. Doctor! Not there! The leg! Leg? I don't need a leg up, I'm fine. Now excuse me. - No, doctor, it's her leg. - Leg! I'm not into legs! I prefer what's between the legs! Takemi, you're no doctor! You're a fake! A fake? Who says? - Who cares? - How dare you trick me! I'm afraid my wife will give birth to some baby with a huge mouth. She came here for an abortion three times. What are you going on about, pervert? A kid with a huge mouth? - Now you're gonna get it. - Hang on a minute! I'd be thrilled to have a baby that looks like me. That's why we aborted it. All right then! Unbelievable! You quack! You stuck it to my wife three times! You looked at my privates three times. Now it's my turn to operate. You want to see a quack? I can play doctor too. - Sorry. - What are you apologizing for? Calm down. I'll close my practice today. -Just don't tell the police about this. - What? - In exchange, I'll give you 200,000. - 200,000? - Thanks. - Don't be so happy! - You don't want it? - Sure I do! I heard, I heard! I heard the whole thing! - Give me 200,000 yen. - You, too? - Damn right. - That's a real doctor's fee. Sister Okei, you're fortunate to be able to join our gang today. When you join the Red Helmet Gang, everyone works as a team. - All right? - Yeah. Yuki, tell Okei the rules of our gang. Rule number one: Anyone who betrays their gang sisters will be dragged around behind a bike. Next, anyone who doesn't act with the dignity of a member of this gang will get 1 ,000 lashes. And last, if one of us is killed, then we take action and strike back. That's it. The Red Helmet girls are tough because we stick to these rules. Let's get her tattooed. Boss. I'm not a boss anymore. Now I've got no place to call home. How's your new boss? We don't have much in common with people from Tokyo. I guess you're right. Any way to make money, Nami? Things are slow these days. You're pathetic. You've gotta be clever to make money. Use your brain. Yeah, but we can't think of anything. Never mind. Come on, I'll make some dough. This is the Tsutsui gang's turf. We seriously gonna set up here? Do it fast and they'll never know. Watch and learn. Today is the climax of the long-awaited Gion festival. Once a year, on the climactic night of this festival, Kyoto women are eager for love. They're all hot to trot. Today we'll teach you the secret of getting a Kyoto girl to sleep with you. Hurry and tell us! The secrets you'll learn are inside this box. - Come on over. - Hurry it up. The charge is only 500 yen. Exact change only, please. 500 yen. 500 yen. You can get your rocks off. Thanks, now line up. Here's 500 yen. 500 yen. Thanks. WOO A WOMAN WITH FLAI R What is this, some kind of con? This is especially yummy, coming from Tatsumi and Yasu. I can bring more watermelon tomorrow, too. Let's eat up, then. You guys. - What are you busting in for? - You! You got any right to complain? Those are the bitches messing with my turf. You better watch those accusations! Don't play stupid, Sachiko. I've got proof your chicks were messing around on our territory. Who? Somebody really do that? One more chick should be here. Never mind. Take their money. Get outta here, punks. I'm the one who was making the dough. If Miss Nami did it, that's no good. Boss, set her straight. How could you do this? I wanted to, that's all. I don't owe you an explanation. Our gang's honor is at stake! Then lynch me, or kill me, or whatever you have to do. Next time, you won't be so lucky. Let's blow. Nami, why did you ignore me, your boss, and go do a job on your own? just 'cause you used to be boss doesn't mean I'll let you make your own rules. - I'm the boss around here. - What about it? You don't practice what you preach. It's hypocritical. You talk about our gang rules, but you don't follow them. Of course not. When it comes to money, there are no rules. We can do whatever we want to make a profit. We follow the rules of our gang, but break all the rules of society. - Don't you even understand that? - What? Fighting isn't the only thing gangs are capable of. You better clear your head. Fine by me. Don't follow us. You twerp! Lousy punk! Shit. Damn! Running wild Drifting Three years pass Deep red skin A rose blossoms No matter how senseless the fight I'll aCCept the Challenge Even a woman must follow the Code A girl boss, a drifter This is where I was born. Yeah? I didn't know your brother was leader of the Tsutsui gang. I was so bitter toward him, I couldn't get over it. Even today, Sachiko, when I got to pull that little con, I was doing it to get back at my brother. Your brother's your only family, right? It's been just the two of us, ever since we were kids. My big brother joined the yakuza. I can't really blame him for liking it. Our house was empty and run-down. I had my share of loneliness, too. Then I was drawn to the warmth of the city's neon lights. And I joined the world of delinquents. I know how you feel. But now I'm trying not to think about my brother. It would be nothing but grudges. Sachiko, don't let your friends feel lonely or left out. It's because we're all so weak that we stand together. Nami, why don't you come into our home? Thanks. But I'm more of a loner. I've always been alone. I'm used to it. You'd better go back. They'll be worried about you. Master Ryotan. My body's so hot. Show mercy! Show mercy! I'm dying. I'm dying! Come with me. Come with me. Master Ryotan, my beloved Master Ryotan. Such a lady-killer. Can't she hurry and drop the goods? What a pain in the butt. I got the proof all right. That really pisses me off! One million yen? That's cruel! You paying up or not? If we take it to the tabloids looking for scandals, the whole country will know by next week. There's nothing to think about. Think you can mess with us 'cause we're girls? Listen, Gramps! Want these photos up in front of the temple? You're being ridiculous! There's an explanation for everything. just because you have photos. That isn't proof! I thought it'd come to that. So I brought this along. Irrefutable proof. A scientific test can determine the exact blood type. I dunno if you're Rh negative or ultra H. But I'd be happy to find out. No, please. - You're worse than the yakuza. - Shut up, you hypocritical monk! Giving in to the pleasures of the flesh. Giving your simple sermons on TV. What a joke! Master, it's only a million yen. You're better off paying up. - Hurry and pay up. - Pay up! I'll pay, I'll pay. This is it, though. This is ridiculous. Cheers! - He coughed it up easily. - Our plan worked perfectly. - So, your gang's here. - What is it? We could use your money. Come with us! What are you doing? TSUTSUI BUSI NESS OFFICE You girls and your gang pulled off a big con. Why didn't you come to my gang first? This time you're getting off easy. I'll take the money you made as a payoff. You handing it over or not? I don't have any money. You're not kidding anyone. I know you blackmailed the head monk of Dogen Temple. He says he paid a million. You wanna push, better know who you're pushing, or you'll get hurt. You still gonna play dumb? This is what happens when outsiders butt in. Crap, I'll remember this, Rika! I never said you could use my first name. I'm in the Tsutsui gang now. I brought Yasu and Kazuko with me. Tatsumi, Nobuko. Stop hanging around with that drifter. People from Kyoto should be leaders here. Come here. There's nothing to think over. Cross the Tsutsui gang, and it's all over. just betray that bitch! That settles that. Now pay up and let's finish this. - You can't be serious. - About what? I'll go round up the other girls who ran away from home. You can earn money for the gang selling them to the bars and bath houses, This will reflect well on you with the boss. - Die! - What the hell! The Red Helmet Gang pays its respects! Crap, beat it! Hey, hotshot. You'll pay for this someday. What are you looking at? Not hurt, are you? That was like a scene right out of a yakuza movie. Sorry, I'm no fair maiden. Hey, I'm not exactly a looker myself. Let's just say we're even. Thanks. So you're training to be a boxer? No wonder you're so strong. - I'm just in the sixth tier. -Just getting started. When do you hope to be champion? This fall, at least I was hoping. But it's not working out too good. - How about a song, folks? - No, thanks. Come on, how about a little mood music? Say, a Shinichi Mori song. Get lost. We've got all the mood we need. Hey, Ichiro. Agata. You jerk! You knew it was me all along. You're the jerk. Ignoring your friend after junior high. Sorry about that. My classmate from RumoiJunior High in Hokkaido. Morio Agata. I wanted to be a boxing champ, and he wanted to be a pop singer. We used to wonder who would get filthy rich first. We were trying to outdo each other! Sachiko Kiyama. It's a pleasure. Pleasure. I'm Agata. Ichiro, are you okay? Lots of boxers fail 'cause of chicks. Idiot! You gotta be determined to be a boxer. Poor guys like us only go into sports or entertainment. We can get girls after we're famous. I'm only joking. Don't be so hotheaded all the time. Sachiko, isn't it? Sachiko, take good care of Ichiro. Agata, have a drink with us. Nah, I never liked being the third wheel. Good luck. That kid's such a weirdo. - So are you. - Not really. You seriously wanna be champ? Sure do. I was born to be a champ. You got balls. Oh, crap. I was gonna get on the first bullet train tomorrow morning. - Making your exit? - Nope. I'm going with Mr. Hamaguchi, a mid-tier champion. I'm supposed to be in his camp for the next title match. I'll be at the Katsuragawa Seaside Hotel at Nishiizu Toi Hot Springs. - See ya. - I won't let you go. I want you. You don't beat around the bush. Never heard of a woman committing rape, though. I will! I want to attack you! How does it feel, being attacked by a woman? - What are you doing? - Shut up. I'm gonna do the attacking here! What are you doing? Sachiko, huh? How's it written? Sachi is written as " happiness.'' Sachi is " happiness,'' huh? But happiness has always been far away. - How's Ichiro written? - Ichi is " one,'' like " one, two, three.'' - Ichiro and Sachiko, huh? - Two ordinary names. What's with the tattoo? - Sorry I asked. - No problem. Every guy I've slept with has asked about it. It's to forget. I got it to forget what happened in the past. You don't regret it? I feel good about it. You're stubborn. I always say the opposite of what I feel. You're not the sentimental type. - You got a crush on me. - Get real. I've never told anybody I loved them. Let's leave, now that we're not so horny. Sachiko, you weren't bad. You're not going anywhere till you say I was great. - Boss! - You're walking funny. Naughty, staying out all night. You're the only one having fun. I'm jealous. See the yellow sunrise? Never mind that. We're leaving Kyoto. - Hurry and get ready. - Where we going? Nishiizu Toi Hot Springs. The Katsuragawa Seaside Hotel. NISHIIZU TOI HOT SPRI NGS What a nice hotel! We staying here tonight, Boss? I thought so. But we'll go to a different hotel. - A different hotel? - A tent, obviously. - That's not what you said, Boss. - Don't be so spoiled. - Ichiro. - What are you doing here? - I told you not to fall for me. - Idiot. I just came to make some money. Kyoto's a hassle. Go away! just because I slept with you doesn't mean we're lovers. You made me miss the train and my trainer cussed me out! - 'Cause you were screwing me all night. - Don't talk like that now. - Want me to rape you now? - Idiot. Miyazaki, is this the cute chick you met? Give me a break. This kind of juvenile isn't my type. - You're not my type, either! - What's your problem? Ukko, what are you doing? Hurry up and help! Makeup's not gonna help you any. Hey, you can't pitch a tent here. Don't be so cruel. We're broke. I don't have any dough, but look. I can pay you with something else. Turn the other cheek. - The Lord is come - - It's a priest! A priest? Now that's my type. - As if you had a certain type. - Nah, not really. - Doesn't look like he's got money. - He'd be fun to con, though. - This time, squeeze them hard! - Yeah, yeah. Father? I want to confess my sins. I've sinned so much, I'm afraid for my future. Father, won't you hear my confession? You're so pure of heart. Confess your sins and become a child of God. I'll help you, my child. That tent can act as our church. SPERMATOZOA WOMAN'S COLLEGE I NTERNAL MEDICI NE RESEARCH Lord Jesus Christ. One of your lost sheep will now confess her sins. Please give her courage and strength. Father. Please forgive my sins. My mother's lewdness gave me congenital syphilis and made me sex-starved. I lost my virginity when I was in fourth grade. I've lost count of how many men I've slept with. Now I'm addicted to sex. I always have sex at least three times a day. I'm so horny! I'm suffering in pain! Father. My body is on fire. Hold me close. First, I need to tell you something important. Forget it. One important thing. Tell me later. - The confession's off. - Okay. I can't bust this guy's balls. Father. I'm better than Jesus, right? The only thing I need right now is tissue paper. Don't cry, now. But - Oh, what was it you wanted to tell me? This might not be a confession per se, but I - I have the clap. The clap? Honestly? What am I gonna do? Sachiko. What's wrong, you horny? None of your business. I won't let you boss me around. - You can't go falling for me. - Don't be so harsh. You must really want it. - I'm not free. - How much? - 1 0 million. - Get serious! I'm not desperate enough to pay for sex. With that face? My trainer says it's off limits. I can't have a girl till I'm the champ. The stray dog of the gym is talking about being a champ? Stray dog? You think I'm a stray dog? You bitch! Boss. Listen, Boss. That priest had the clap. The clap? I need to go to the hospital. Take me there. I can't go alone. You like doing it, don't ya, sweetie? Wanna get together sometime? Come on, Hippo. Hurry up. Coming. - Idiot. - I've got a good idea. Let's pass the clap on to them. Sex with a yakuza? Who cares, it won't go away. Hurry up and finish. - Hey, hey, hang on. - All done. Next? - I feel so much better! - Nice, huh? We'll be able to do the chick every day! Yeah, but, bro, how about letting me go first tomorrow? You got it. What, you done already? - I came way too fast. - What? Nobody else there? I'll close up shop. Okay, bro. I'm going for a double header. - Go for it. - You show her. This time, no looking in. Greedy guy. Once should be enough. Sis. My love's clouding your heart, right? I'm taking you to heaven! Bust his balls. Looks like we got the clap. Sure does. Four guys killed in action. My balls are on fire! She sure busted our balls. Keep it up. Upper, upper, from below, below. Keep going. Upper, upper Tuck in more. Your right's not tucked in. You don't have to look so serious. I came to have a nice chat today. Coming from you, it's gotta be that you want into my gym. I haven't changed my mind. My answer is still, " No.'' Please don't jump to conclusions. One of your young men went and broke up a fight on my turf. What exactly are you talking about? The kid was an outsider, but he butted in on one of our fights and beat up my boys. Is that true, Ichiro? He may only be in the sixth tier, but you must understand what happens when a pro punches an amateur. I'll tell you my terms. Bring me 50% of the take from tonight's title match as a " get-well'' gift for my boys. Moreover, you'll be my business partner. If you disagree to my terms, I'll go to any length to make you accept. I won't just kill your young boxer, but I'll crush your champion's arm. Subduing others by threats is just your style. But I'm not giving in. If Ichiro caused a ruckus, that's a job for the police. You're thick-headed. In my gang, I've got lots of men who aren't afraid to die. Don't you know that the cops can't help you? I could even kill him right now. You're just using this incident with Ichiro to get a piece of the action in the boxing ring. I can't agree to that. Get out of here. We're not going anywhere. Think about who you're dealing with, then give me your answer. All right? Let's go. Boss. Sorry. All this is because you couldn't tell the difference between boxing and fighting. I'm taking you out of the ring. Daddy. Over here. When did you come here, Chizuko? You surprised me. That's why I came, to surprise you. Always a child. How's school? University closed ages ago for summer vacation. And hanging out at home is a drag. I really wanted to see you. Are you sure you didn't come here for some pocket money? Daddy, you're clever. - What's that? - It's nothing. - Show me. - I said, it's nothing. Stubborn. Never mind. Here, drink up. Don't let it get you down. My fight got my trainer in trouble with some gangsters. Sorry. You did it for me. Don't worry about it. As soon as he lifts the ban, I'll fight all I want. Things might be rough, but come tomorrow, I'll be able to put it behind me. That's my motto in life. " Things might be rough, but come tomorrow, I'll be able to put it behind me,'' huh? Ichiro, look! There's a hot-looking chick here. Cheer up! Go and chat her up. Idiot! That's my trainer's daughter. You're coming with us, babe. How about an explanation? - You'll know why soon. - Let me go! - Damn. - Don't. Fighting's forbidden for you. - It's my trainer's daughter. - Wanna give up your dreams? I'll go help her. You hurry and tell your trainer. Nami, when did you get here? Sachiko, why so upset? I'll tell you later,just come with me. Trainer. Taking Chizuko is a dirty trick. You're not in a position to judge. It's your fault for not agreeing to do business with me. Are you gonna cooperate or not? Don't care what happens to your daughter? - Where are you taking me? - Silence! Let go! Bro, those girls are following us! I can't shake them. Hurry. Too bad your plan didn't work. - Chizuko. - Daddy. You bitch. Next time you pull something like this, I'm calling the cops. Get out of here. Damn you! You fools! Fool! Messing up at the crucial moment. You let those juveniles put one over on you? Nakahara, I'm holding you responsible for this. Your little sister was part of this! - Take care of the rest. - All right. I'll return as soon as all the equipment is packed. - See you, Ichiro. - Good-bye. Thanks. - Good luck. Bye. - Bye. Agata. Ichiro. What are you doing here? I'm on my way to Tokyo for a job. My song's really popular on a midnight program. I'm gonna be on TV tomorrow. Way to go, Agata. I dunno whether to be happy or nervous. I've come a long way, and I'm not giving up yet. I wanna hear the song. It's called " Red Elegy.'' " Red Elegy''? Ichiro, I wrote it about you. It's Sachiko and Ichiro's song. A song for us, huh? How touching. Play it for her, too. She's probably at the beach. Hang on. How do you like being punished by the Tsutsui gang, girls? You won't mess with us again. Stubborn slut. You're going too easy on them. They won't learn their lesson. Nakahara, you do it. Don't go easy on her just 'cause she's your sister. Damn! Stop, you'll kill her! Shut up. This is what happens when you get in our way. Don't ever betray our boss. Get lost! We'll always betray him! Don't hold back. Cut off an arm with the band saw. Let go! Let go! Get back! You meddling bastard! You little - Punk! How dare you! Damn it! You punk! Run for it. Stop. Idiot. Get someone to take the rap. Let's blow. That'll teach the prick. Hang in there, Ichiro. I don't wanna die. I wanna - be a champion. That's the spirit. You'll be a champion. Here. For you. First time I ever... gave a present... to a girl. Ichiro? Ichiro! Ichiro, you goddamn idiot. You died without hearing my song. Sing it, Mr. Agata. Even if I do, Ichiro won't hear it. I'll hear it for him. Sing it for Ichiro. Love is love, and yet What's the point? The man, IChiro So sinCere and yet SaChiko's happiness Where Could it be? The man, IChiro Will be what he will be The year will end And spring will fade If the Cherry blossoms fall Spirits will also soar You were so lonely What was wrong? You had a dream Of your mother Only one bed That's what you want A home, a home If only you Could stay Hey. They betrayed us! That means punishment. You little - Noisy bitches! Shut up! Come on, you'll be punished for betraying us! Ready, Boss. Teaches you for crossing us. This is what you get for selling out and turning against us. Sachiko, it's all over now, right? You sure about that? That'd be a good gig. 20 pistols and 1 0 automatic rifles from the US base at Yokota. If this deal goes well, they say they'll get us 30 pieces. Can you trust the broker? Cell mate in the joint. All right, let's take them all. Contact him at once. That slut! Get her outta there! That way! Don't let her escape! Let Sachiko go! Nami, don't do anything stupid. Shut up, brother. Nakahara, let her down. Sachiko, hurry and get outta here. I'll shoot. I'm gonna shoot, brother. I'm seriously gonna shoot. Shoot then, if you can. You messed with my gang. I'm nothing now. The gang is my whole life. Let go! You bitch. You won't get away this time, slut! It's Nakahara. The goods will be here at 1 0:00 a.m. tomorrow. The drop is at 1 1 :00 a.m. at the Lake Biwa Hotel. Fine. Then we'll leave here at 1 0:00 a.m. Is that all? Don't go near my gang again. Kyoto isn't your home anymore. Get outta town. If you stay, I won't have the heart to go on as a yakuza. Nami, got that? No. I don't have a brother. On the night of the Gion festival, with the music playing, my big brother used to hold my hand and walk with me. That brother died a long time ago. Don't touch me. Only my brother can be close to me. The back door's open. I'll use this dynamite and blow them to smithereens. How many years has it been since we saw a sunset like this? If you want to take them down, it has to be tomorrow. The boss's car is going to Lake Biwa tomorrow at 1 0:00 a.m. Lake Biwa? That's your only chance to do it. Thanks. Don't tell the others, okay? I want this to be my personal revenge. Personal revenge. You must have really been in love with Ichiro. I want to forget that. Come tomorrow, I'll be able to put it behind me. I'm not going. There's the car. Damn it. I'll blow them to bits at exactly 1 0:30 a.m. Move it! That punk. Sugata. Get away from her car. Punk. You punk! Shithead! Get out, punk! Stupid bitch. What's that sound? The blinker probably got damaged when we smashed cars. That's what it is. Oh, yeah. This might work out well, Boss. Good-bye, my hometown. Where to now, Boss? Any way the wind blows. We'll follow our hearts. Ready to go? THE END
