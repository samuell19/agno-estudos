I entered this world through a door no one wanted to open. To survive, I had to advance and overcome each obstacle. The stars became my refuge. The place of stars in my life? It's hard to explain, but... they're like a symbol of hope where everything can be reborn. SUGAR AND STARS Where's the chicken? Table 8's order! Plate and send. - Start the salt-crust fish! - Yes, Chef. For table 14! Table 15, big shot. Let's make it good. Rectangular dessert and plate. Match the forms. That creates harmony. - What do you notice? - It's simple. Not simple, pure. Remember, the plating must be elegant. This image gives the first impression of your creation. It wakes the eye's taste buds, before discovering your dessert. An almond crisp with a hint of sea salt. A dark chocolate cake... Young man, please? - Young man! - Sorry. I think you don't understand. Come here. Come here. Closer. What do you hear? - Nothing, it's quiet. - Exactly. That quiet is called respect. They all know that. To learn, you have to be able to listen. You must be new. Who hired you? I did, Chef. He told me Ballé, your ex-partner, sent him. You signed his internship. I didn't sign anything. It's two years since I spoke to Ballé. You know Ballé? Yes. Well, in passing. What do you mean, in passing? Did you lie to me? Never mind. Deal with it. I'll replace him, Chef. Get back to it! At least try me out first. Try you out at what? A dessert creation. If it's good, keep me. You've got nerve. But we don't work that way here. Get back to it! To your places! "Responsibilities must be seized." As you say. You've learned your lines. "To earn recognition, you recognize others." A Black Forest for table 5. A Black Forest for table 5! Yes, Chef! Let me make it. So show me. You're taking a big risk. You did it my style. A tribute. I'm not dead, don't overdo it. Ok, visually, you're not there yet. Now let's see what it's worth. Antoine... Yes, Chef? We'll keep the kid. He has something. Too much, in fact, but... it's not bad. It needs to be refined. On trial from Monday 8 am. Be on time and presentable. Yes, Chef. Table 5's Black Forest! What is this? Use the service door. Off you go. Become France's best dessert chef Young chocolate makers "His big eyes and fangs didn't scare the fox cub who struck up a conversation." What does FBW mean? France's Best Worker. Do you think I can be the best? - For me, you already are. - No. The very best, so my mum will care about me. How d'you become a champion, Auntie? I've no idea. You need to ask Mathieu that. Or try asking Papi. He dreamt of being France's Best Craftsman. I know it's a lot of hard work. A huge amount. More than Mathieu? More than anyone. Shall we finish the story? Who are you? - That's my bed. - I don't sleep next to the can. You did this? Screw your crap cooks. Fucking loser. Guys, a fight! They're fighting! Calm down! Don't touch my stuff again! Get to your rooms! You leave without permission and come back to stir up shit. You turn 18 in two years but you're my responsibility for now. The others steal my canteen earnings. I leave to avoid trouble. Isn't it you, terrorizing others? Not true. Who said that? I'm the victim here. A victim? Samy... Can you leave us? Give me the names of those stealing, or I'll get you transferred to the Carpentier home. But, ma'am... Only you know me. Only you can help me. Your canteen pay. Come back when your memory returns. You can't do that! I can do what I want. It's for your good, Yazid. Give me your trainers. Hurry! What for? - The other one too. - Why? Hurry. Stop asking questions. Auntie bought me them for school. Quick! They were already worn out and old. Come on. I don't know what to do. They won't let me see Yazid. I can't sleep because of my medication. Don't worry. We'll work something out, ok? They won't let me be a good mother for my son. I don't want to lose him, Mirna, understand? That's why I'm here. I'll help you. Are you making money now? I'm afraid not. Since my pregnancy, I haven't worked. If I had money, Mirna, would I let my son wear such shoes? Look. He was wearing those? Bad things have happened before. I should dress him, not them. I'm his mother. The foster family gets an allowance for that. I can push your case again... No, please, Mirna. I need money right now. If I wait that long, I'm dead. It's not possible. Please... Mirna, only you know me. Only you can help me. A special handout. Sign this. It'll keep you going for two months. Thank you so much. But that's my last card. I understand. Thank Auntie. Come on, let's go. It was a turning point in history. Note that. Can you develop it? School is no use. I'm gonna succeed. A kid in the home I wanna blow it up My bag's packed I'm ready to split All these years I kept a low profile But life sucked When I woke at night Mum, not Dad Put me on my feet I grew up in life Without any dreams Of anything Never mind, I have life Hello? - Are you ok, Samia? - Yes... It's Simone. - Is something wrong? - No, I... I was getting worried. Have you seen the time? Yes, I know it's late. Ok, but... I want the best for my son too. - He has school tomorrow. - He'll be there in half an hour. If you have a problem next time, give us a call to tell us and we'll work something out. All right. See you later. Bring me his bottle, please. Don't use tap water. Use bottled water. Fill it to the third line. Where is it? I don't know. Open your eyes! Hurry! Who put this shit here? Wake up. What the hell? Drop the kid off. Where's his mother? She prefer look after baby. Hello, kiddo. How are you? - Have you eaten? - Dad! Come and see, please. Who's it for? The soccer club's 50th. School tomorrow, get ready for bed. It's not finished. I'll do a velvet frosting, but should I finish with spun sugar or meringue? Why not do a soccer boot? Yes, with chocolate studs and liquorice laces. Dad, when you retired, your cake wasn't shaped like a plumber's spanner. He's right. It was just an idea. Flowers. I'll let you artists work it out. Good night. Coloured flowers. No, not flowers. Not for a men's team. Why can't men have flowers? Flowers are the most basic decoration. Who said to use all that? Use the powder and mix with water! - It's gross, Chef. - Don't do that! Just put the powder in the pots. Why can't you ever obey? What's up with you? Work! How's it going? Well? I didn't get a word, but I'll produce you, man. - I'll leave you to it. - See you, bro. What's up? Massena took me, on trial. - The chef? - I start Monday in Paris. The canteen's over. It did my head in. I'll be with the best. I'll learn nothing here. You're the one teaching Ohtak stuff! Hey, you jerks. Got my weed? - You owe me 20. - Just 20. Hey, Ohtak. What's in the cream? It's delicious. That's not normal. Yazid made it. Jerks like him never pay up! She won't give me my money. Victoria? Why not? What the hell? You're my lookout! I am looking out. When you were in the box, the office, maybe no one... Let's split. It's like Schrödinger's cat. - Yazid, wait for me. - Move it! - Schrödinger's cat is a theory. - Gimme a break. I'm talking to you. A cat's dying and you walk off. There's this box, like, with a cat in it. If you don't open the box, you don't know if the cat is dead or if it's alive. Wait for me! That's real quantum mechanics, not some joke. In the projects, raise your hands Immigrants' kids, raise your hands In the hoods, raise your hands In the ghetto, raise your hands What's up, guys? How's it going? I told you to come alone. - Who's he? - Yazid, my bro. - A kg again? - I can't hide it at the home. - I'm in a home. - You did it last time. I leave early for Paris tomorrow. You're off to Paris? Carry stuff for me? No, I'm not into that. You're not interested? - Not for money? - No. The cops! Come here, you! Stop right there! Head down the stairs! Go, guys! The shit's climbing! I did nothing! You're not fast. I'm injured! Stop whingeing! This is where our tax goes? Like you pay tax. Calm down. Fuck. Don't move. - I didn't do anything! - Your hands. What's this? What've you got? - What? - What is this? - My money. - Your money? What's it for? - Get up! - I didn't do anything. Guard! Ryad, look how good I am. I'm beating the record! Come with me. - Breakfast! I'm hungry! - Later! When do I get out? Officer! Sign this paper. Take your stuff. Leave that. Let's go. I'll teach you. We're going to have an explanation. Oh, God, why is this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this? Why me? God, why me? You have to thank me. I got you out of that shit. I want to know what you did to end up there. I want to know. Or what did I do? Answer me when I talk to you! Answer me, child of sin. Why don't you say anything? Answer me when I speak to you! Answer me, you idiot, Yazid! Don't run off, you idiot! Don't run off, Yazid! Yazid! Hey, Yazid! Where were you? What's that? Where were you? - I'm always guilty with you. - You ask for it. I'll be frank. You were taken into care. You know what that means. Look at me. You don't have many options. Either you toe the line here, or you have a talent for something. And I think you have a talent. Feed that talent. Don't waste it. Your dessert yesterday, it did something to me. Whatever you put in it, it brought stuff back. - What is it? - You smile now? You always push it too far! Go to your room! Stay off my radar today! You're taking my threads? I have an appointment. With a woman? In Paris. The mannequin with the tits is to hook babes? Yeah, exactly. That's wicked. You're gonna get laid, you devil! I'm so happy for you. Go ahead. Next time, ask. If my threads get you laid, tell me about it. If you want. Send it out. Sorry I was late, Chef. Chef, sorry I was late. Chef... I travel 180 km every day to get here. I do that to learn with you. Think I enjoy being late? I spent the night in custody. We all deal with shit. I don't give a damn about your life! It's not my problem! You must be irreproachable here! Get it? Get to your station. Thank you, Chef! How's it going? I'll show you something. How a real pastry chef breaks eggs. You take two eggs and break them in the middle, see? Get it? - A strawberry gateau? - Yeah. Go on, keep at it. That's good. I got out the ingredients for the cream. Yeah? That's good. What'll you use? Vanilla pods, flour... You threaten guys with knives? What is this? I never threatened him. It's always my fault! Did you see Zidane's corner shot? A lightning bolt! Look at this good-looker. Did you get laid, you sly devil? Tell me about it. Yeah, I got laid. She loved the polo. That polo shirt's a killer! You bet it is! Is she a blonde? A brunette? Does she live with her parents? She has her own place. That's wild! Her own place! Guys, I'm beat. Can I tell you about it later? Yeah, no worries, bro. Sorry. Hold on a second. You'll score big in this. Yes? You sent for me? Yes, thank you, Samy. It's about Yazid. We can't keep him here. I want him transferred to Carpentier. You can't do that. He'll get eaten alive at Carpentier. Too late. My mind's made up. I told him. And did you tell me? It's an abuse of power! Yazid has a talent, you can't destroy that. We've given him his chance, more than once! After thefts, fights, lies, custody... What's next? That's our job. We keep trying, even when they screw up! I know my job, ok! There are rules here. Seriously? This place isn't right for him. So that's your approach? Don't you look at their past? You get rid of them when you want! I won't let you ruin his future. I'm your superior here, ok! I'm simply telling you that he's leaving. - Period! - Then I'll leave too. - Cut it out. - You heard me? Yazid goes, I go. How'll you manage then? The door's right there! Are you serious? I say he stays. I'll fight, for Yazid or another! A dessert is a selection of exceptional raw materials. Never more than three flavours. Keep that mind. The texture is the flavour. A molten heart of cherry, a hint of cream as an opener. Then you have the biscuit with a lingering flavour of Valencia almonds, say. We're like perfumers. Head, heart, base. Desserts require instinct. And the idea... is to find childhood flavours that marked you. Like Proust's madeleine. But... there's no secret. It takes practice. So practice. Head, heart, base. Head, heart, base. Service over for the day Next train: 6:36 Change the coffee grounds. What's going on here? He'll propose next week. Which hand? This one or the other? What? What's wrong now? We'll sing this at your wedding. Elisha, my love! We'll see. You'll get jealous. We want to be jealous. Make us envious. Happy birthday to you That cake's beautiful! I blow them out? Are you ready? One... Two... Three! See how good Papi is? A present? For me? You're sweet. It's a professional secret. We'll give you confidence. We're professionals who accompany young people to help them find a trade and build a future. We work... Ok for tonight? Kevin! It's a sound and helpful framework with rules, like a uniform such as mine. You know Samy's getting fired. Because of you, man. ...do company internships, catch up on schooling and get your driving licence. Why didn't you begin with that? What was the big speech for? Thanks for defending me, Samy. You shouldn't have. You look worried. I'll lose you your job. Don't worry, it's my path in life. We all have one. But, Yazid, don't lose sight of your goal. Failures aren't defeats. See them as helping you grow. Have a good life, my friend Believe me, you too have to know how to bounce back. Off you go. - What's this? - My stuff. Let's go. Tell us what's going on first. In the car. You said it was urgent. We were worried. You're running away. No way! We don't want the cops coming. Some run away for weeks. No one cares here. Know what we risk? They'll destroy me if I stay. I beg you, let me believe in it. The chocolate maker contest will change my life. A dessert order: a financier, a Valentino, a St Honoré, a raspberry finger and a Royal. Got it. All right. A financier, a Valentino, a St Honoré, a raspberry finger and a Royal. Yes, Chef! Which one can I do? - Already finished? - Yes, Chef. Do the raspberry finger. Ok, thank you, Chef. Don't be pastry chefs. Be artists. Explorers. The texture helps assimilate the taste. Don't denature the products, respect them. Be simple. Chef, how do you become the best? It depends. Want to be the best, or a genius pastry chef? You become the best by following the rules. If you don't, they'll do all they can to exclude you. Or... Or they'll say, "He's a genius." How can you tell? You'll know. Hey, genius... Do the job I gave you. Get to it! Yes, Chef! Let's get to work. You can send this. That's not what I wanted. Jess has done a Valentino too. Listen to your superiors or we won't get anywhere. Sorry, Chef. - Any baker could do a finger. - He's right. Chef... Try mine and Yazid's to see which one we keep. All right, let's see. You need to ask him for advice. - Yazid, do another. - Yes, Chef. The same one, ok? Ok, back to work. Yes, Chef! That's good. We haven't finished. Yazid! Simone, let me in. Let me see my son. Open up! Are you ok? Hold on. Let's talk in the kitchen. Samia! I know what's good for my son, ok? Yazid, open up. Samia! Open up, don't get me mad! Open the fucking door! Auntie! Open up, stupid! Open up! Open the door! Why wouldn't you open it? Answer me. Why? Why are you scared? Why? I'm your mum, you know? You shouldn't be scared of me. You shouldn't. I'm your mum. Shit... You know I love you? I swear I love you. I swear I never wanted to hurt you or your brother. It was an accident. Sweetheart, I swear. Believe me, please. I know it's hard for you. Come here. Come here, sweetheart. Come on. I can't even take care of myself. How can I take care of you? I can't even live with myself. How can I help you live? I know it's hard, but that's how it is. I can't help myself. - Auntie, can you open the car? - Yes. Both doors. - Are the boxes in the back? - Yes, don't worry. Yazid... Oh, my God! Oh, shit. This is your fault! - Your fault! - Calm down. What do you want? You ruin everything! What do you want? Leave me alone! You're not my mother! Stop! You're useless! You're not my mother! Leave me be! Yazid... Just leave me alone! Leave me alone! FRENCH RIVIERA We have 57 covers today. A group of 17 people will have the tasting menu. Start work on a fig tart and a lemon sorbet. One person doesn't like figs, so we give them a tarte tatin. Got it, Chef. Get to work. Yes, Chef! Let's get to it. Don't waste any time. You'll sort fruit all week. Don't give me orders. A sous-chef arrives on time. Caramel financier for 4! Look lively, gentlemen! Give it rhythm. Campos, this isn't a bakery. The flour goes on the rolling pin, not the worktop. - Straighten up! - Yes, Chef. Move... Disgusting. Redo it. Yes, Chef. Sorry, I didn't hear. Yes, Chef. I like that. And pick up everything on the floor. - What? - "What?" It's dirty. Thank you, Chef. That asshole... See how he spoke to me? I nearly floored him, that shrimp. I'd have dealt him an uppercut. Like in Rocky. - You know Rocky? - Yeah. My favourite bit is in Rocky. When Adrian gives birth. Rocky tells her, "It's ok, if you don't want me to fight Creed." And Adrian says... "There's one thing I want you to do for me. Win... Win!" Then the music kicks in... That scene's wild! Even so, Julien has talent. But he sucks. A daddy's boy. I bet half the hotel belongs to his granddad. His work is good. You defend him? I don't. Talent is talent. Talent is the mojo. The richer you are, the less you have. Right... Talent or not, you work to succeed. Know what they call you? No. FBA. France's Best A-rab! And that's funny? Know what? I'm gonna qualify for the French team, go to the world championships and win. I have to. Ace it in the heats, man, and shut the bastards up. Try this. From your finger? It's just cream. Wanna fight? Just try it! You don't play with food! Not food, cream. Ok, I'm stopping! Not so smart now! Know what? When I make it, I'll go to the States, open my luxury cake shop and rake in the money. The States... It's the same as here. What d'you mean? You can never get ahead here. You just make rich guys richer. Find yourself a rich guy. Yeah... A nasty white guy rolling in money. I'll avoid the poor. They're contagious. Why work with me? You? You're undercover. An Arab working in a luxury hotel. You can do it! More strength, more energy! You're flagging! That's it, champ. Keep the rhythm! What's up? - A breather. - Go, champ. What a bastard! Man, I don't get it. We had the same ingredients. I told you. Simplicity is the key. - It's not possible. - Chill... What did you use? We're ready. We're gonna be big. I have to go. I can't let my woman throw me out. It's heavy with her right now. Not going home? Go on, I'll finish here. Sure? Yeah. - Chef. - How's it going? Chef Satomi! Table 5 sent this back. I'll see to it. It's Bouchard... Ok, who made this? Me, Chef. What do you call this? A Paris-Brest, Chef. A Paris-Brest? We have a comedian. A real clown. Your Paris-Brest is a Paris-Shit! Clear up this shit, take off your apron and get lost. Enjoying the show? Want to follow her? Get back to it! Don't help, let her do it. She screwed up. No mistakes allowed. We're not just anywhere. What can I do? Is that why I'm cutting fruit? I know you train here every evening. Do me this favour and I won't tell management. I'll need help. Thank you. Mr Chemra, it's the hospital in Epernay. We've been trying to reach you. Samia Chemra was hospitalized last night in infectious diseases. I'm calling as you're one of her emergency contacts. Call us on... Perfect. Bouchard wants to meet you. What for? He's dying and wants you to take over. I've no idea. He wants to thank you. He likes what you do. Ok, lead the way. - Sir? - Yes? Here he is. Bravo, and thank you. I see why you don't go home. Why're you here? I sensed something weird. Why didn't you say? Yazid... You have a salary. It's cos of the banks. The banks? My account's frozen. I staked it all on the contest. Before I knew it, I was deep in debt. They take every cent I make. One misstep and the system gets you. I'm the same. You just fought with your woman. My woman's the system. Your woman or your ex? I don't get it myself. One day we're fine, the next it's war. We don't speak the same language. I don't understand women. It's all good at first. - It's all kisses... - Manu? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. You're stupid. You're my buddy. Your problems are my problems. I've always got by alone. My family's in Epernay. But I'm good. I see the stars every night. You're a lucky guy. You sleep in a billion-star hotel. See the brightest one? The Pole Star. Below it, there's a square. That's the Great Bear. It's shaped like a pan. Are you serious? Even looking at the stars, you talk shop. It's true. That's the Little Bear. - And it's a small pan. - No kidding? Seriously, you can check. The guy sees pans everywhere. Return to your plating station. But keep an eye on the fruit. Thank you, Chef. How do you do it? I'm totally wasted. It's practice. Do I have to fetch them myself? What a jerk. Cool it. Cool it. Take it slow, man. Is the piccaninny tired? He didn't have his banana? - What? - Defending your bitch? Yazid, come with me. Why are we here? This is your new room. - Here? - Management okayed it. Thank the managers and Manu. See you later. How's it going, kid? Aren't you at work? It's quiet. I'm on my way to the hotel. I know you're busy, but it's Auntie's birthday. I was going to call her. I don't want to bother you, but... Your mum's in the hospital. It's worrying. It's the championship soon, but... maybe you could call her. I have to go now. Take care. Can I take an hour for a private order? Thank you, Chef. - Hello, everyone. - Hello, Chef. It's a great team. Thank you. You sense their desire. And that matters. I'm glad it's still on the menu. It's still very popular here. The latest creation: the chocolate sphere. How's Mr Paris-Brest? Very well, thank you, Chef. Very good. What's this? The fruit's mouldy. Who supervises fruit here? I do, Chef. You disappoint me. Earning stars isn't hard, but keeping them is. Excellent desserts don't make a great chef. Let's go. Is this sabotage? Yazid! I have no choice, Yazid. You have to go. Happy now? - Got what you wanted? - Are you nuts? Think it's funny? Got what you wanted? Shit, Yazid, not like this! Think. Deep breaths, please. I've brought you something. Yazid made it for you. Everything ok, Yazid? Yeah, everything's great. - That's not a Winter. - It is. - It's the wrong colour. - What? It's the wrong colour. Damn, I made a Green Velvet. I'll see to it. Can you serve table 4? Your three mojitos. Here you go. - Another drink? - The same again, please. I'd make you a Paris-Brest, but it won't be easy. Of course... What happened at the Grand? They fired me. I was leaving anyway. I began here yesterday. - I'm still learning. - So I see. In sweatpants too... Stretch pants. More comfortable. My waiters are rarely so sloppy. I'm not up on fashion. You have to advise me. I got hired here hoping to meet you. You were more timid last time. One ingredient can change everything. I'm the same. I'd hire you as chief pastry chef, but you'd be bored in my bakeries. Precisely. I read you want to get into luxury cakes. A tough world. I try. But every attempt meets with a smear campaign. They're an elite, imposing their taste as the norm. I fight that. Yazid... Just a second. So? What are you after? You. I'm doing the world pastry team championship. I have neither a place, nor the money to train for it. I need a sponsor. Apart from your amazing Paris-Brest, why would I agree? A world champion working for you to get into luxury cakes. It's a fair deal. 6 MONTHS LATER - Julien will be there. - Seriously? In the same group. How many do they pick? One per heat. Just one? To form a team of three. Slow down, it's on the right. It's crazy how Bouchard helped. You found your rich white guy! He's a self-made man. Self-made, my ass. I bet his granddad owns all of western France. No one's self-made. He's a worker's son. There are workers and workers. He let you train in his kitchens for months? Admit it, man. You gave him your ass. He had dozens of kitchens with no one to use them. Or no one to use. You just make him richer. He's not like other rich guys. You'll see when you meet him. Know what I'll tell your pal Bouchard? Turn right! - Here? - Yes, turn! There. That was easy. See an entrance anywhere? I don't know this place. This isn't possible. No sign for the French team qualifications? Hold on. What's that? - Is that it? - I think so. Pull over. - Got it, bottom and top. - Let's go. Ok, got it. Careful. Hold on. Sorry, ma'am, excuse me! - It's not here. - What? Listen... Straight on, on the right, the blue door is the entrance. There are blue doors everywhere! Room number 3. Here. Where do we go? Yazid Chemra? Booth number 5. You're the last. From here on, it's solo. Yazid... Win. Get going, sir. It's about to start. Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the qualifying heat. What's happening? No... Excuse me. There's no power in my booth. - What? - No power in my booth. So? Call somebody. - A problem? - No power in his booth. Bernard to Thierry. With three microwaves, it's normal. I need all three. Use one or it'll blow again. There you go. It's back on. Get to work. 100. Passionfruit and salted caramel. With sea salt. Bravo. You'll represent France at the world championships. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Ok, great. Move in a little closer. Three quarters on, a big smile and let's go. Ok, a big smile... I know what you went through to earn this. Discover the profession. It's a team profession and team work will win the cup. This year, the theme is Leonardo Da Vinci. Each creation is sublimated by an ice carving. Bruno and Yazid on confection. Fred, do the decoration. As for the ice carving, Yazid will take care of it. Your painstaking work impressed us. If you feel alone, remember I have your backs. Gentlemen, get to work. - Ok, guys. - Let's do it. We're going for the surprise with the safe. Fine. A safe. The surprise of raspberry to heighten the acidity. A double phial. Liquid chocolate, emulsified and sublimated like this. Pick a movement to confer a sort of dynamic with open wings... I don't know. This isn't bad. Not bad, but I prefer this lighter effect. We'd love to come to see you. You know, we've always been there to encourage you. That said, it's your decision, of course. You know, you deserve it, Yazid. We're proud of you. We don't want to pressure you. After all, you must be under enough pressure. Add a hint of bitterness. Welcome to the French team! You've always been a fighter. You're incredibly strong. A real example. Are you still there? I'm here, Auntie. And I really want you to come. Let's share that moment. I'm so glad, Yazid. We train a lot. I'm proud of what we're doing. I've never worked so hard. And I feel a bit lonely here. You're not alone, Yazid. We all think of you. That's kind, Auntie. You know... I'm not your mother, but you're my son. Auntie? Yes, Yazid? I love you all. We love you too, Yazid. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP This year, six countries are competing for the top prize. Gentlemen, this is it. I've nothing to add. I know you're all ready. Remember, you can only compete once in a lifetime. - So go for it. - Yes, Chef. Let's go, guys. Let's win this. Ladies and gentlemen, we're pleased to welcome our guest of honour. We're about to experience an exceptional event. The world's best pastry chefs are here.
