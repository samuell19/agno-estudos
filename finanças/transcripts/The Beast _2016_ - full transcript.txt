[no audio] [forest animals chirping] [opera music] [music continues] [strange noise] [music continues] [music stops] [door opens] [footsteps] [leaking gas sound] [door opens] [door closes] [silence] [sighs] [opera music resumes] [music stops] [door opens] [door closes] [silence] [opera music] [high pitched noise] [male] I wake up... and there's screaming. It won't stop. [30's music playing] It's watching me. It knows... then it runs, in to the house... and... takes it. [thunder] Steal's it. [crickets chirping] My prize... my sweet, sweet prize. Takes it deep into the woods. [music continues] It hides it from me. Soooo... [thunder] I must find it. [fire burning] [sirens wailing] [car engine] [Auguste] What am I asking you? No. No. [indistinct chatter on the phone] Okay. It will all be ready. Yes. [doorbell rings] Midnight. [thud] [jazz music] [Auguste] Andrew! [Andrew] Hello. [Auguste] Come in. - [Andrew] I'm coming late. - [Auguste] No, no, you are fine. I tried to call, I'm sorry. No service up here, my boy. Although, I do have a land line, if you think you'll need to make any calls. Oh... okay. You plan on making any calls? I don't think so. Good. You know, you are actually much earlier then you need to be. I thought you said to come right after the show. I did. I did. Come in and meet Jim Perkins. [screams] No, no, no. [jazz music in the background] Leave the hat on. You got to leave the hat on. - Really? - Yes. Yes. If you say so. [in weird voice] I say so. [chuckles] You are an adventurer. Pow! [Auguste] This is Mr. Jim Perkins, who was a big fan of the show, and a bigger fan of your performance. Oh... [Andrew] Thank you. Thank you. That's really, very, very kind. [jazz music in the background] [Jim] It was really something. [Andrew] I am glad you liked it. It was very ambitious. We had a lot rehearsals. Oh... Just like the Russians. I was explaining to Mr. Perkins, how we created our terrible shrieks in that scene where you come up on the pygmy seance. Oh, yeah? It's sort of a game that's played in the conservatory, theater classes, where you pass the energy from person to person until it makes its way back around to you. We went in to the woods, to do a series of audio recordings like that. It turned out quite intrinsic. [jazz music] Go on! You've earned it. Okay. Who else did you invite? I'm sure they are coming along. So, what do you do? Beside your theater work, I mean? I am an assistant manager at Albertsons. The grocery store? Yes. [chuckles] I've never been. It's a wonderful store. I do all my shopping at Albertsons. Would anyone like a carrot? No, thank you. [music continues] All right. What do you do? [Auguste] Mr. Perkins is an architect. [Jim sighs] He designed the Clock Tower. - Clock... - The Clock Tower. It's right there by the bank. [chuckles] It's tall, it's red. You've seen it. [chuckles] Oh, right. Okay. Some of his sketches are also being consider by the board for the new library. Wow! That's great. I hope that works out for you. Well... well, we'll see. Quite the opportunity. The new library. The board... [doorbell rings] Here we go. Come in! Mr. Moore. Glad you could make it. [William] Yeah, this place wasn't easy to find, at all. Did you follow the directions I gave you? [William] Yes. But your directions, you have roads on here, that don't exist. Oh, they exist. I know the roads. - Well... - [Auguste] You're early, anyway. This is the architect, Jim Perkins. This is Andrew Booth, the star of my play, which you didn't see. Gentleman, this is Mr. William Moore. A former... colleague of mine. So, is this everyone? We are all playing darts, I mean are we waiting for somebody? Or what's... What's going on? What are we doing? I'd like for us to all have a drink first. And talk a bit. - Get to know one another... - So we are not playing darts, - is that what you just said? - And, please, have a carrot. Gentleman... [jazz music in the background] [indistinct chatter] [opera playing] [waitress] Afternoon, sir. I can start you off on something to drink? No. I don't want anything. I don't want anything. [music continues] [grunts] [chatter continues] [Auguste] Perkins? Perkins? - Yes? - [Auguste] Jim Perkins? [chuckles] Yes... [Auguste] How's your food? Oh, it's fine. Auguste Porter. [Auguste] Do you mind if I sit down? Actually, I am having a really... [Auguste] No, it's all right. I'll only take a moment of your time. - I've been following you. - Excuse me? Your work. - My work? - [Auguste] I think... it's innovative. Captivating. Profound, actually. Your Clock Tower is beautiful. - Is there anything I can... - [Auguste] I've written and directed a play that's opening on Friday at the Skyfire. Have you been to the Skyfire? - That's a theater? - [Auguste] It is a theater. Very simple... intimate theater. I've set aside a ticket for you. It would really mean a great deal to me if you would come to my show. Oh, you want me to see your show? - Yes. - [Jim] Well, I don't know what I'll be doing... [Auguste] It's only playing for one night. So... it would really mean a great deal to me if you would come. - Well... - [Auguste] And I'd also like you to attend the after party at my house. [Jim] I am sorry, what did you say your name was? Auguste Porter. [male] I saw a poster for that outside the American legion building. It's just that, Mr. Porter, my schedule this week is... [Auguste] I would, also, like to discuss a business proposition with you. I've invited... some other people who I consider to be paranoids of the community also. Do you know Victor Morales? - I know Vic. - [loud thud] Well, yes, I know Victor Morales. I mean not personally... Oh, Victor Morales is gonna be there. [Auguste] Now, the play doesn’t get out till 10 o'clock. I think... right away we should... come to my house for the after party. Here is the direction to my house. Actually, it's a lodge. About 30 minutes outside the town. Should be no problem finding it at all. [waitress] Can I get you anything else? Just the checks, please, separate. And would you like anything, sir? What did I tell you over there? Right over there? Oh, he's gone. He's gone to lunch. He'll be right back. Just, wait a minute. [blues music on the radio] [music continues] [door opens] [door closes] [thud] - What are you doing in here? - Mr. Moore! [smiles] The receptionist let me in. - Did she? - Yes. [phone ringing in the background] [coughs] Would you like to sit down? [mumbles] Yes. Okay. - How's the sandwich? - [William sighs] - Did you need something? - I hear you are a bit of a darts man. - What? - [Auguste] I am bit of darts man myself. In fact, I am inviting a few people over Friday night, - for a match. - Where is this happening? [Auguste] My house. - My lodge. - [William] How much can one stand to win at your game of darts? You can stand to win 300 dollars. Here's a map. [William chuckles] It's just outside the city. Thirty minutes in the woods. Should have no problem finding the place, I don't think. All right. Are you enjoying your new office? [William sighs] Yeah, I do like this office. - Where is the tree? - What? [Auguste] There used to be a tree, right outside there. [phone ringing in the distance] I have no idea. [Auguste] It would really mean a great deal to me if you came. I'll see what I can do. [footsteps] [horror music] [loud banging] [imitating dog barking] - [thud] - Andrew! - Hello there. - [Auguste groans] [Auguste] How do you feel? I feel good. Good. So... are you nervous? No, am not nervous. - Are you nervous? - [Andrew sighs] I don't know. I am just a little worried... I might fall or something. What do you mean fall? This is your stage, this is your night. You are not gonna fall. [Auguste sighs] I was sitting in my car at the parking lot... and I was thinking... was just sitting there thinking. The closing monolog... what if we move it to the beginning? - Of the play? - [Auguste] Yes. Right away. Open with it. - Really? - Just open with it. So... So, I open with the speech, - and then... - Go on from there. All right. - I... - [Auguste] Then after the show when you come to my house, wear the costume. For the party? Yes. Okay. Okay. [sighs] [Auguste] I actually... designed the entire... lodge. I built it. - [Jim] You built it? - Mh-hm. Myself. You shoot that big boy yourself? [Auguste] I did. I hunt deer, elk, rabbit and moose. Moose is my favorite meat. [Jim sighs] We are having moose, tonight? [Auguste] No, no moose tonight. Just carrots. - [Auguste] Just carrots. - Okay. If you would come to my play, you would know the significance of the carrots. [William] Well, like I said, I had a lot of... [Auguste] Lot of work to catch up on, yes. Mr. Perkins came to my play. [Jim mumbles confirmation] Tell Mr. Moore what he missed. [Jim sighs] It was quite a show. I bet. [Auguste] Andrew here, played the explorer. We journey, we, the audience who was there... follow him through the jungle as he makes his way, to the source of the river. In fact there is a scene in the play, it might be my favorite scene, where Andrew the explorer... is up late one night... fishing with a spear... and suddenly, from behind him... What is it? How does that part go? When you see it. What's that part? - Well, I am in the tent... - Can you do it for us? - The scene? - Yes. Do it. Just that part. Jump up over there and do that part. Mr. Moore hasn't seen it. I want him to know exactly what this is all about. [Andrew gasps] I don't know about that. [Auguste] Mr. Moore. Would you like to see the scene? Yeah, sure. Mr. Perkins, you'd like to see the scene again, would you? Oh, I don't mind. [Auguste sighs] You are already wearing the costume... [Andrew sighs] [violin music] [Auguste] Please... We'll all like to see you do it. [violin music in the background] [Andrew takes deep breath] I see it. There. It's... watching me. It's watching me... [yelling] It's watching me, it's watching me, it's watching me, it's watching me, it's watching me, it's watching me... Okay. All right. - That's the scene. - [Jim sighs] My favorite scene. [Jim clapping] Now... who took it? Who took it? [Jim] Who took what? Which one of you sons of bitches took my jet ski? [William chuckles] - Your jet ski? - My jet ski. [William giggles] I didn't take your fucking jet ski. We'll see about that. [Jim] Are you accusing us of a-- [Auguste] What am I asking you? - Me personally? - You! Are you fucking with me? - You are snake. - [Jim] I don't mean to be... You told me that Victor Morales is going to be here-- He's standing outside the house. My lodge. And it's burning. The house... the woods and you three... come crawling out of the mud. [fire burning] [alarm noise] Only you're not you, you are animals. And one of you... not sure which one, one of you runs into the house. A blaze... and comes running back out... with my jet ski. [violin music in the background] [whispers] Right. [glass clicking] [footsteps] [glass clicking] [pouring drink] Why don't you pour yourself a glass? I don't drink. What? - Drink! - [Jim] I'll be leaving now. - Leaving? - [Jim] Leaving. You brought me here under false pretenses. You said that Victor is going to be here and, uh... he's probably not even coming. And I have better things to be doing with my time. [Auguste] Like the things that you were doing in that motel room last Wednesday? What? [Auguste] Perhaps when you leave the three of us can continue this evening discussing just how... exactly you spend you're Wednesday’s in motel rooms. I don't know to what you... [mumbling in low voice] I don't know to what you are referring to. - Yes you do. - Are you trying to blackmail me? I think... Yes, I am. You know nothing. You know nothing about me. Perkins, why don't you have a seat and pour yourself a drink. It's getting late. [yelling] Perkins, don't test me. I am not going to ask you again. Have a seat, pour yourself a drink. [glass clicking] [pouring drink] It's common knowledge, I assume, that I've recently resigned from my work at the university. - [William sighs] - [Auguste] So, I mounted a play. Despite its pitiful and incomplete form, I've invited you two gentleman to come and see my play for a particular reason. - Pitiful? - [Auguste] Yes. Pitiful and incomplete. [William] You were fired. I beg your pardon. [William] You didn't resign, you were fired. [Auguste] Is that what you heard? - [William] Yeah. - [Auguste] From whom? - I don't know. - Thomson? I don't know. - Mr. Porter? - For what reason did he say - I was fired? - What do you want me to tell you what he told me or what everybody else thinks? - What do you think? - [William] I think probably that you are mentally unstable. Mr. Perkins, are you enjoying your drink? - I don't know. - [William] So, you tell me you never hit a student? Because what I heard-- [loud thud] [door opening] [slamming the door] [sighs] I'll go talk to... [William sighs] [door opening] Part of that was funny. [Auguste] Have you gotten your ticket? [Jim] Oh, now, I just got here. - Oh! - [Jim chuckles] I'm so glad you made it. Come. Look. You see my poster? - Look at that. - Yes. [Auguste laughs] So, you'll join us after the show? Oh, you know actually, I am not sure if am gonna be able to make it, tonight. Why is that? Oh, no I just had very... very busy day. I am very tired. I'm not entirely sure if am gonna be up much. Oh, goodness. And, um... you know, we should have lunch sometime next week. Perkins? This business proposition, it can't just wait until next week. You see, I am building a structure. Yet, you... Starting tomorrow, am building a structure outside of my house. It's going to be a very... complicated... detailed structure. I can't do it by myself. Your... input... is incredibly important to me. Oh... And I would give you Three hundred dollars... [piano music in the background] for your... help. Tonight. - Three hundred dollars? - Yes. I'm sorry. You are going to pay me 300 dollars? To come to my house. And provide your professional opinion. And you've invited other people? I have. A few, yeah. Like I said, Victor Morales is going to be there... [sighs] [high pitched noise] [forest animal sound] The sun is rising. [barely talking] There... is no... food... [yelling] There is no sleep. [evil laugh] [forest animal sounds] There are no rules. [evil laugh] There are... no days... [yelling] I must, follow the river. To the source of the river. [Auguste] There's a lair of fungus. [crickets chirping] This house is built on it. Did you know that? [Andrew] Really? [Auguste] Yes. Makes me sick. [Auguste sighs] [Auguste] Were you gonna ask me something? You said that you thought that the play was pitiful. And incomplete. [crickets chirping] Yes. Is that because of me? I am sorry, it was too late to go back. What? [Auguste] What I skipped. [breathing heavily] I skipped the burning elephant scene. I didn't mean to. I couldn't remember the line about the lake, so I just went to the next line that I could remember. By that point it was too late to go back to the elephant, it wouldn't make any sense. So... I just kept going. [crickets chirping] My wife died in a fire. [crickets chirping] [Andrew] You don't really think that I stole your jet ski, do you? No. [Andrew sighs] Okay. Good. Because, I... I didn't even know you owned a jet ski. I would be happy to help you find it, though. If there is anything I can do... Andrew, I think you are going to be a great help tonight. [William] Oh, I know he was fired. His wife recently left him, so... The man, clearly, has psychiatric problems. He might even be dangerous. I doubt he's dangerous. - He's been lying to us... - [William] Yes, but I got to say I am kind of enjoying myself. It's like a big weird show but with... really good free alcohol. I'm just gonna, he's not gonna... nothing but a good time. I am not enjoying any part of this. Then leave. [door opens] [Auguste] Gentleman, I've made a decision. - You are gonna kill yourself? - [Auguste] No. No, Mr. Moore, I am not gonna kill myself. I am gonna make you a deal. No. No. [footsteps] [Auguste sighs] - Where are you going? - To the basement. Follow me. [Jim] I am not going into any fucking basement. - There is no time. - Why? What are we doing? [heavy breathing] There is a beast. A creature. A horrible thing from the woods. I captured it one day, while I was hunting. Now it's down in the basement, I have to make sure it's there, shackled to the wall. No. No. - Yes. - No. - You think I am lying to you? - Mr. Porter. [Jim] Please, I just wanna, I just wanna have a word with-- Wait, wait. You... you have a monster in your basement? You can stay up here if you like. I am going to the basement. I have to make sure. [William] I think we should all go to the basement. Yes. It might be better if we all stick together. [Auguste] Perkins, you can't stay up here alone. - [Jim] I just wanna leave. - Jesus! Come on. I just wanna go home. [Auguste] And you can, once we know it's safe. - Andrew... - Mr. Porter, I don't... [Auguste] Andrew, what's the matter with you? [Andrew] This isn't something... Andrew... I thought you were an adventurer. [door opens] [footsteps] [dramatic music] [Auguste yelling] No. No. No. [everyone panting] [Auguste yelling] No! [Auguste panting] - It's escaped. - What? [Auguste] The creature. Fucking thing. It's not here. It's gone. [William] You know, maybe, maybe, um... maybe we should go find him. Maybe we should go upstairs, have a drink and then just go outside. You think this is funny? [William chuckles] Yeah. No, I am being serious. We should go upstairs, drink a hell of a lot more and then find the monster. You fucking idiot. [yelling] The beast has escaped. [yelling] Get your fucking hands off me. [Auguste grunts] [Auguste] We are all gonna die here tonight. [Jim] Jesus Christ! Why would you say that? Because the beast has escaped. And now it's out there, it's out there and it's waiting. Fuck it! Fuck it! - I am getting out of here. - You can't leave. Don't put your hands on me or I'll break your fucking face, I swear to Christ! - [Auguste panting] - [William] I'm out of here. Bunch of bullshit. [Auguste] No! I cannot allow you to leave here - for your own safety. - [William sighs] [Auguste] You have no idea of the scope. The scale of what we are dealing with here. - With-- - Shut up! - This beast-- - Shut up! You are full of shit. I don't know if you realize it or not, you are fucking drunk, you are fucked up, whatever the fuck you are, but am done. I am fucking done! It was nice coming here, drinking your expensive booze, has been fun and cute running around doing the crazy shit we've been doing, but am fucking sick of it. And you took it too far by touching me and smacking my face. You are lucky I don't come over there and fucking kill you. So do yourself a favor, fuck off, don't talk to me. I am done. It's bullshit. Fuck you! [yelling] Mr. Moore! [intense music] [crickets chirping] [door opens] [door closes] [door opens] [footsteps] [thunder] [door closes] [suspenseful music] [thunder] Get inside. [thunder] [dialing phone] To whom am I speaking? Sergeant Clark, a dead animal has been hung up outside of my home. Yes, we are quite concerned about it. [intense music] All right. [sighs] Thank you. [phone hangs up] [Jim] What did he say? The police? They are sending someone over. Hey, what the fuck is going on? - A warning from the beast. - [William] No. Somebody put that out there. [Auguste] The beast has escaped, Mr. Moore. We held it captive and now it's angered, and hungers for flesh. [William] We didn't do a god damn thing. - You did this. - Did what? - What did I do? - [William] I don't know. - [Auguste] What did I do? - I don't know. You tell me. What did you do? I think we should calm down and have some drinks. Perhaps we should all, calm down, have some drinks, wait for the police to arrive. - Please. - [William] No. Fuck that. A person, a human being put that thing out there. Are you saying there is someone else in this house? [William] I don't know. I don't know what the fuck are you doing out there. What were you two doing on the porch? [Auguste yelling] We were on the back porch! And we weren't there for more than a few minutes. - And you called the police? - You watched me call the police! And you actually called the police? Look, call them back yourself. I suggest we start thinking about how to deal with this situation. With the beast! Stop fucking saying that. Stop fucking saying beasts! Tell me what the hell is actually going on here! I don't know! [yelling] I have no idea! We are dealing with a very dangerous force here, that none of us understands. None of us! This creature, it's, it's... [Auguste panting] Unless, you've... any real ideas as to what we should do, I suggest... [raises voice] we sit down! Have some drinks. Wait for the police. [glass clicking] [pouring drinks] Did they say when they would be here? When they get here. [Auguste] Mr. Perkins? - Yes. - Here. No! I don't want it. I don't want it. You take this glass. Andrew. [Andrew] I don't think I want any carrots. Andrew. No, I-I am serious. I don't want that. You want this. I am not comfortable right now. [Auguste] Listen, inside we are safe. The doors are locked. Unless we go back out there... we are fine. Please. Andrew. Eat a carrot. Now... Mr. Moore. Mr. Moore. - [lights click] - [Jim] What happened? - [Auguste] I don't know. - [Jim] What happened? - What happened to the lights? - [Auguste] Calm down. [William] Did you turn off the lights? [Auguste] Now why would I do that? How could I do that? [William] So, they just turned off? [Auguste] Apparently... [match lights] Or something shut them off. [Jim] Can you get them back on? [Auguste] Yes. Andrew, you are right. There is a circuit box outside. We need to go out... and see if we can get those lights back on. You want to go outside? [Auguste] The policeman won't be here for another 40 minutes or so. It would be just silly to wait around in the dark, - don't you think? - What about the thing? The thing? - The-the animal. - Yes, of course. You are going out there alone? - [Auguste] Absolutely not. You are coming with me. - [Andrew] Me? - Yes. Take this lantern. Are you sure? - About what? - [William] That we should... that we should be going outside at all. - If that thing-- - Andrew? - What? - [Auguste] Without light, we are vulnerable. This is something that needs to be dealt with immediately. - But why do I have to go? - Because I asked you to. And because you ruined my play. Now take the lantern. Stay in this room. We'll be right back. [footsteps] [match lights] [footsteps] [thud] [dragging noise] [heavy breathing] [crickets chirping] [footsteps] [silence] [sighs] [dialing] - [phone drops] - There is no dial tone. Well, the power is out. - That has nothing to do with it. - No? [William] No. You are an architect. - You don't know that? - It's the new power lines, maybe he got patched into the same circuit as the other ones. It doesn’t make any fucking sense. I just feel sick. Fucking thing. [lights switch on] [jazz music] All right, look. What ever he had fucking planned here, I don't know what the fuck it is but now he's got a gun. You understand? I don't know how safari man is going to react but we have to restrain them, both of them. And I need to know that you are going to help me. [snaps fingers] Hey! You listening? Look... are you gonna help me? Hey! You gonna help me? [Auguste] He's gone. [jazz music in the background] What? Andrew's gone. He must have seen something. Heard, I don't know. We were just standing there, and suddenly he took off. [loud thud] Ran into the woods. [music continues] [Auguste] I don't understand it. [Auguste sighs] [Auguste sighs] [loud thud] What are you doing? Where you gonna hit me with that? Perkins... Were you two conspiring against me? [Jim in weeping voice] No... [Auguste] You think I did something to Andrew? - You didn't call the police. - What? [William] I checked the phone. There was no dial tone, you didn't call anybody. I called the police. You were all standing there. [William] There was no dial tone. I put the phone to my ear. - Perkins? Was there a dial tone? - [whispering] I don't know. - [Auguste] You don't know. You didn't listen? - Put the gun down. - There it is. [Jim whimpering] - Where? - Right there! [Auguste] It's in the window. It's watching us. - Where? - It's right there. [Jim panting] Just stop it. There's nothing there. You snake... - [Auguste] What are you doing? - You need to let us leave. [Auguste] You trying to turn Perkins against me. [William] You need to let us leave right now. [Auguste] It's outside. The beast is outside. It was in the window. We saw it, didn't we Perkins? - You saw it! - [Jim] I don't know what I saw. You saw something. - [Jim] Yes, something. - [William] No. No. No. This is a dangerous man, Perkins. [Auguste] There is no telling what he's-- Don't fucking listen. He's trying to confuse you. [Auguste] He's already tried to use violence on me. - You'd rather the beast have-- - There is no fucking beast. [Jim vomiting] [Jim panting] [Jim coughing] See what you've done? [Auguste] There, there. - [Jim whimpering] - It's all right. Here, get up. You wanna just step back a bit? [jazz music in the background] [sighs] Here, eat this. - I'm leaving. - No, you are not! Mr. Moore. [door opens] [crickets chirping] [William panting] [Auguste] Mr. Moore. Woah! Mr. Moore look at this. [William] What the fuck did you do? [Auguste] This is Andrew's hat. What the fuck did you do? What? [thunder] The fucking cars? Where is my fucking car? Cars? [William] What the fuck did you do? Get back. Get! You need to restrain yourself. What the fuck did you do? I don't know, I swear. I don't know about any cars. - [William] Where-- - We have to be quiet. [William shouting] Where's my car? - Quiet! - [gunshot] We need to go inside, Mr. Moore. [crickets chirping] I'm going inside. - Does-- - [Auguste yelling] Get inside! [door slams shut] [William sighs] [breathing heavy] [thunder] [William] There is no dial tone. [Auguste dialing] [William] There is no dial tone. - [Jim] Why aren't they here? - [Auguste] What? [Jim] How aren't the police here? What did I just say? [William] You have any other phone in the house? - No. - [Jim] Yes, the one you used earlier in your office. No. [Jim chuckles] Yes. You used it. No, that's a no. - No. - [Jim] You told me, you had to leave the room to make a phone call. Lower your voice. [Jim] No. - You said... - Perkins, lower your voice. [yelling] I was not crazy. [Auguste] Right. What are we going to do? - Well... - I'm not crazy. Perkins. - What? - Do you hunt? [Jim] What? No. Have you hunted? Have you ever killed? - No. - Then you should be quiet. What are we going to do? [Jim] Why would you ask him? [Auguste yelling] Shut up! Shut the fuck up! [sighs] Must have been the beast. He was the animal that took my jet ski from the burning house. Because if... my lodge is burning... the creature is... there. Waiting... So, I follow it. I walk into the woods. Through the woods... to the lake... [suspenseful music] - and drown myself. - [William] What is this? - What are you doing? - What the fuck is this? Did you unplug my telephone? You didn't call anyone. You didn't call the police. I called the police, Mr. Moore. I don't know what game you are playing by unplugging telephones... why would you unplug my phone? I am gonna beat you to death tonight. - Are you threatening me? - [William] Yes. You don't threaten me. - Where is my car? - I'll fucking shoot you. [William talking firmly] Where is my car? [William chuckles] All right. Just... - just let me go. - [Auguste] This is not my home. What? This isn't my home. Belongs to the little old lady upstairs. [yelling] Where is my car? [Auguste] This is not my home. [William whimpering furiously] [thud] [Auguste] Her and her husband are up there right now. In the attic. [picks up the phone] [drops phone] Why is there no dial tone? [Auguste] Did you break that woman's phone? [William] Can we... can we just call the police? [Auguste] The police can't save you from the beast. [yelling] Fuck you! Call the police right now! I am the beast. Fuck you! Let's call the police. Let's stop this. - Come on. - Perkins, get up. Get up. Go over to that piano and lift up those antlers.

Don't give him the gun. - Perkins... - [glass shattering] [man grunts] [footsteps] Why is there a hat on the offering outside? I didn't put that there. Well, there shouldn't be a hat on the offering. [Auguste] Yes. Yes. I didn't do that. Why aren't you upstairs? - We were waiting for you? - Where? What are we doing? [footsteps] Mr. Crabbins is going to take care of this now. You can stay down here, if you like but... I don't think it's safe. I'm going upstairs. [Auguste muttering] You got to understand, I have a responsibility to take care of this woman. I've done everything I can up to this point. I'm not gonna stop you from leaving, but I need that gun. You can both go home. Please, Perkins. [sighs] We are going upstairs. Mr. Moore? We are going upstairs.
