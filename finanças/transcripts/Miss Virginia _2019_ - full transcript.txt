Don't make me call security. Oh. Look at you, Mr. tough guy. Well, I guess you got a lot to prove, what with those pants and all. You said the people of D.C. don't want change, and they do. Now, I took a petition with hundreds of names to the Council last night. Shouldn't we at least have a conversation? That last shot doesn't count. You have no idea how difficult this would be. If we lived anywhere else, you could go to your local government and set up a scholarship program. That's what we did in Milwaukee and Cleveland. But in D.C., you need an act of Congress. That means you need to get the attention of a bunch of politicians who don't care about you, because you didn't elect them. And then you've got to get them all to agree, which happens... never. And then you need the President to sign it into law. You have a better chance of winning the lottery than getting all of that done. Well, no wonder why nothing changes around here. Exactly. Until now. [ Silverware clanks ] I've been in this game for a long time. There's a way things are done -- or not done. And that doesn't change because you want it to. Disagree. Disagree all you want.

Prevents bad choices... like those pants. These pants are tactical. They blind the opposition. Ha! What, so folks don't see how bad your game is? I like golf. But what I'm really good at? Legislation. You better be. You have no idea. Congressman Williams: Education is the civil rights issue of our time. We, the people, have failed in our moral and legal obligation to provide quality education to every American child. Right now, thousands of children right here in our nation's capital are bearing the burden of our failure. These children are caught up in a cycle of poverty, dependency, and crime. We have abandoned the most vulnerable members of our society. And we must do better. I'm thrilled to introduce the D.C. Education Incentive Act. This bill will create a scholarship fund so that low-income parents like Virginia can send their kids to schools where they will break free from the shackles of poverty. It's my pleasure to introduce you to Virginia Walden, a single mother from one of D.C.'s toughest neighborhoods. Please put your hands together and welcome Ms. Virginia Walden. [ Applause ] Man: First you let her run over you at the town hall meeting, now this. Honestly, Lorraine, it's like you want us to pull our funding. No, no, no. I-It's nothing to worry about.
