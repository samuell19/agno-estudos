[ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Laughing, Chattering ] [ Man Narrating ] What's happening? [ Doctor ] Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox? Mr. Fox. Good to have you back. I'm gonna get you something for the pain. [ Soft Groan ] How you doin'? Yeah. Hey, um, I went by your house, checked your messages. There's one on there from Hank... I think you should take a look at, you know? When you get to feeling better. And, uh, your mom's doin' fine. I'm just gonna keep checking on her. [ Groans ] What's goin' on? - You don't-- You don't remember? - Remember wh-- What? Bud, they found you the other night-- at the old warehouse district-- in John Kaskill's office. You were unconscious. He was on the ground next to you-- dead. You had a gun. Huh? God! No. [ Sighs ] I think you've been set up, Bud. Looking better, Mr. Fox. You feeling better? [ Handcuff Clatters ] Doctor, I'd like to have a couple of minutes with your patient-- alone. Nurse. We'll check with you later. Mr. Fox. - Detective Morales, L.A.P.D. - How you doin'? - Do you know why you're here? - I was hoping you could fill me in on that. We found you at the Key Point warehouse a couple of nights ago. So what? So you're under arrest for the murder of John Kaskill. Oh, don't you think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here? No, I'm right with you, Bud. - That's right. Pull that out. - "You have the right to remain silent. "If you give up your right to remain silent, anything you say"-- Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Of course, you know that you can stop answering my questions anytime you want. That's very considerate of you. So why where you there? I was called there. Oh. By whom? Kaskill's daughter. Yeah? [ Woman ] She must have found out. He went completely nuts. Leigh? Slow down. What is it? We have to take care of this, Bud. Who's back? What time is it? Time? The time is now. Don't you get it? I'm out again. I just know it. I'm screwed. Where is he? At the warehouse. Just meet me, okay? This is bad. It's really bad, Bud. Why did she call you? I'm an old friend. And, uh, friends often go over to their fathers' offices in the wee hours of the night? All right. I was working for her. Ah. Okay. What'd she want that particular evening? That's between me and my client. [ Leigh's Voice ] Hurry, please. I'm scared. [ Gunshots ] - You oughta know that. - So? So I ain't telling you. It ain't pertinent. Well, I happen to think it is. Well, you happen to think wrong. Well, listen up, dick. I happen to think, wrong or right, that this is now an issue between me, you and a dead man. Now, what time did she call you over? 1:00, 1:30. She woke me up. Uh-huh. And what'd you do? I went over there. I got in my truck, went over there. So how did Kaskill get two slugs in his chest then? I don't know. What was the old man's gun doing next to you on the ground? I don't know. I went over there to help the girl. All right. Did you meet her there? You know-- She wasn't there when I got there. Does the name Kate Winters mean anything to you? - Does that ring a bell? - Sure. So you knew that she was seeing Kaskill? [ No Audible Dialogue ] That's right. I've been tailin' him for the past three weeks. Of course I knew that. Tailing him. What-What for? That's between me and my client. But you know that too. You knew they were sleeping together, right? Sure. And you also had an intimate relationship... with Ms. Winters in the past, correct? Yeah. So-- Let me get this right. - So now she's bangin' John. - I want my lawyer. You just flip out over that. Isn't that right? - Is that what happened? - I want my lawyer. - Okay, all right. That's what happened. - The right to remain silent. I'm not gonna-- Go to hell. - That's what came down, isn't it? - Why don't you go to hell? Yeah, all right. I'll see you there. Nurse! I'll make sure you have a phone in here, Mr. Fox, so you can call your attorney. Nurse! Get outta here! Yeah. There's a uniformed police officer here too. You need to ask me any more questions-- Have a nice day. - Enjoy those bracelets you got on. - [ Handcuffs Clatter ] [ Man ] Yeah. No, I got 'em. I got 'em right here. They're right here. 3:30. [ Sighs ] Yeah. - Thanks for bail. - Yeah, no problem. That'll be 50 grand. Seriously, Bud. We gotta get together and hammer this out. Your ass is pretty well slung over the barrel here. They got prints, powder burns, a weapon, an unconscious, intoxicated subject at the scene of the crime with motive. - Shall I continue? - I didn't do it. - You think? - Yeah. Maybe I-- Uh, I don't think so. Um-- [ Sniffles ] Just give me a couple days. I'll figure something out. - When? - End of next week. - You got a smoke? - No. I quit last year. Oh. Yeah. - I'll be in touch, okay? - All right. Don't screw around. Okay? Yeah. This is serious. This is 25 to death. I'll be in touch. Send me over the Kaskill file. Get me up to speed. Ask Claire.

Yeah? - You needed some information. - Right. Well, he was about 6'-- Oh, 6'2". Built. Brown hair and eyes. He looked like Tom Cruise, but taller. Tom Cruise. Anything else? Well, there wasn't any accent or drawl to speak of, and-- - I'm not even sure that he was exactly gay. - What do you mean? Well, he performed, but I think it was for the money. The setup. Well, that's a pretty rough way to get by. - Well, thank you, Mr. Fox. - I didn't mean it like that. You got anything else for me, like, uh, number plates, tattoos, anything? No, nothing, but he did speak of Springfield. - But I already checked that out. - Okay. Got a name? [ Chuckles ] Oh, dear. Yes. I'm so-- Um, Pat Dorfman. Pat Dorfman. Okay. All right.

Why do you think that? Well, I've been auditing the books, and it looks to me like he has been-- [ Sighs ] It looks like he's been cooking the figures for a while. Uh-huh. Not to mention, I overheard him talking to that bitch... about buying land outside of San Saba. San Saba. Where's that? It has to be a retirement ranch. I mean, nothing happens in San Saba. No?

The very one. - Okay. The plot thickens. Right? - [ Chuckles ] What the hell's goin' on here? I don't know, but Godfrey's definitely made a name for himself... snatching up companies on the cheap, chopping them up... and selling them off piece by piece. That's what he does. Maybe the guy's interested in buying up Key Point. I don't know, but he will definitely be sitting in the catbird seat... no matter how my dad steps down. [ Chuckling ] Right. Right. Right. Right.

Well, uh, I don't think I can continue with this investigation. - Why the hell not? - [ Sighs ] I was engaged to Katherine Winters two years ago. I can't believe that. Yeah. [ Leigh ] Small world. It's getting smaller. [ Laughing ] So you were engaged to the bitch? It's a little more complicated than that. How so? Didn't end well. She started threatening me, my mom. She started sleepin' with my best friend. So one night I got into it with her. Cops were called. I had a piece on me. - Oh, Christ. I knew it. - It wasn't loaded, but, uh-- But-- But it looked like it was gonna go to trial. So with the stress and everything, my mother had a stroke. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. So I plea-bargained. I got a suspended sentence. I got a restraining order against me. I lost my gun license. Oh, well, that's a relief, isn't it? [ Leigh ] So where does this leave us? I just wanted you to know it's something that, uh, you might wanna consider. - I-I don't see a problem with it, for me. - No? Okay. Then if it's okay with you, I'd like to take a sniff around... inside your old man's office. Sure. Also, uh, hopin' to take a look at that piece of land out in San Saba. - What for? - I just wanna see it. Just, uh, you know-- See what he got himself. He bought himself a ranch. You can take a look at the pictures. I know. I'd just like to see it for myself. What for? Hasn't this guy got better things to do with our money... than take a joyride up north? Shut up, Jack. I-I gotta make sure that your story holds water. That's all. What? You're a lowlife, Bud. Shut up. You probably always have been. What are you doin' with this guy? Shut up. Shut up. I should have taken care of the bastard when I had the chance. We wouldn't be in this mess with that animal Dorman friend of yours... or this son of a bitch here. This isn't a good idea. I gotta go. I was just gonna do you a favor, but-- - Yeah, well, good riddance. - What is wrong with you? What has gotten into you? We need him, you idiot. Bud. Wait. Uh-- I'm really sorry about that. You know, Jack just-- He's had a tough time. My dad blames him for... my mom's death. Five years after they got divorced, my mom committed suicide, and Jack was with her. He was 12 years old. It's just had a huge impact on his life. I hope you'll reconsider. Please. [ Exhales ] Okay.

Do you have an appointment? I'm kind of an old friend. Just came in from out of town. You know how it is. You're not really an old friend of his, are you? What do you mean? Any old friend of Mr. Kaskill's knows... he takes every Memorial Day week off to go deep sea fishing with friends. Right. Memorial Day. Where'd the old bastard go this time, huh? Is he still giving you girls a hard time? If I knew, you still wouldn't. There's the door. Okay. Yeah, so anyway-- Thanks. No, just some guy. Yeah. No, I think you should wear that red dress for sure. [ No Audible Dialogue ] I was trailing your dad today. I came across something pretty interesting. I thought that we were gonna leave that behind tonight. Oh, I think you might wanna hear about this. You ever hear of St. Alfred's Hospital? Hmm? Well? He's going there again? Oh. He was a patient before? Yeah, a couple of years ago, but he just needed someone to talk to. [ Laughing ] Someone to talk-- Yeah, well, I also trailed him to the airport, and he went on a fishing trip. What do you know about that? He takes that trip every year. He lands more deals than fish. I'm sure he's lining up a sucker as we speak. [ Whispering ] Let's get out of here. Do you want to come in? [ Bud ] Yeah-- What did Jack mean about, uh, "the doorman," back there? We wouldn't be in this mess with that animal Dorman or this son of a bitch here. What was that? Oh. Oh. The doorman. That was nothing. That was-- He was gonna help us get some info-- My dad's doorman. You're gonna have to take the back door. Go up the stairs. Second floor, fourth office on the right. Got it. "St. Alfred's Hospital." "St. Alfred's." "Timmins Detective Agency." [ Exhales ] Did you find anything? No, nothing. Nothing? Listen, I'm gonna drop you off... and head out to that piece of land-- San Saba. I wanna take a look at it, if that's okay with you. Sure. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah? They're-- You know, Jack is just weird about it. There's some things that he-- he can't get over. Yeah. You mean, like his attitude? [ Laughs ] Like your attitude. Huh? [ Laughs ] Where am I taking you? Get on the freeway. Okay. You're just gonna have to trust me, okay? Okay. [ Bud Narrating ] Trusting her. That's what's got me into all this trouble in the first place. [ Shutter Clicking ] Always knew you'd end up living out of garbage cans, Bud. Just never thought they'd be mine. What the hell are you doing here? Who put you up to this? Leigh? You've been tailing me this whole time? That's all right. She'll get hers. And one way or another, I'll be sure as hell to get mine. That's right. Ours now. It's amazing what a real man can do. Now get the hell off my property before I call the cops. What am I missing here? What am I missing? [ Chattering ] Well, looks like he bought it about a year ago-- June 1. Oh, yeah. Wait. Can I get a copy of this, please? Oh, I'm sorry. No. All right. Hey, what's this number right here? That is the payment identifier. Believe it or not, that number right there-- That means it was paid for in cash. Ooh. [ Laughs ] Cash, huh? - How much? - I can't give out that kind of info. So, uh-- Hey, maybe you could help me out here. Just kind of like, uh-- Oh. Sorry. Uh, give me a little, kind of rough estimate... of where the land lies? Sure. Hey, uh, in your humble opinion, how much do you think that that land would be worth? Just this side of a hundred G's. Oh. [ Laughs ] Wow. That's a lot of cash, huh? Sure it is. Sure is. Okay. Well, thank you very much, sir. You are very welcome. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. [ Claire ] Where are we? It's the middle of nowhere. [ Claire ] So this is it? [ Bud ] Yeah. Hundred thousand bucks buys you all of this. Who was the woman with Kaskill the other night? It was a snake I was gonna marry. I take it it didn't turn out so well. Nope. [ Beeping ] [ Ringing ] Yeah, this is Jon. Who's this? This is Bud Fox, from Fox Investigations. Fox Investigations? What can I do for you? You remember working for a John Kaskill a while back? Yeah, sure. How could I forget? I'm working for his daughter, and I'm hoping maybe you could help me out here. Uh, yeah. Let me see what I can dig up, and I'll get back to you. Is there a number that I can call you back at? Uh, yeah. 323-- Uh, wait, wait. Hold on. - You got it? - Okay, shoot. 323-555-0198. I got it. Listen-- I'll call you when I got somethin'. Thanks, Jon. Say, you get a chance to look into that Godfrey thing today? Yeah. Actually, this is a little intriguing. Um, I followed him to a gun shop... where he, uh, bought something small. Maybe a revolver. And then I lost him in traffic. He made a few calls, too, but the great commonwealth of Australia is a little stingy... with the sordid past of its citizens. What did he do, kill somebody? Maybe. Jon Timmins? Yeah. Hey. Bud. Sorry I'm late. Not a problem. Anything to get me out of the office. You ready for another? Yeah. Why not? Two. So you find out anything on this guy? Well-- Finally. I had to dig through all my old files. Could I get a scotch with that? Yeah, make that, uh, two. It was a bitch, but I got the information you wanted. That's great. I really appreciate it. [ Chuckles ] Not a problem. But you are gonna owe me one. Oh-- [ Chuckles ] I'm sure I will. I'm sure you'll collect. So tell me what you got. Well, it's a pretty straightforward scavenger hunt. A fella named Godfrey. Kaskill just wanted the lowdown on him. Why? He didn't say, but I figure this Godfrey guy's a real fistful. I mean, he covered himself well, but I wouldn't trust him as far as I could screw him. Got one of his lackeys here too. Right. Arthur "Chip" Brennan. There's a bunch of doozies in the file. They might come in handy. I don't know. But this guy-- He liked to work troubled young boys, if you catch my drift. Aw, Jesus. That's about all I remember. The rest is in the file. Okay. Great. You're doin' this for the daughter, right? She's, uh-- She's a client. A tail job, you know? Yeah, I remember. She was a puff piece of ass. Yeah, she's something-- a little too much. You know what I'm saying? [ Chuckling ] Yeah. How do you mean? You know, the kids. You know, she's got two of 'em. If I wanted someone else's kids, I'd go buy some. [ Chuckling ] Are you sure that we're talking about the same girl? Yeah. Why? You didn't find anything on them? No. No, just divorce. Some wild-ass deadbeat's what I found. You sure? Yeah. Old man Kaskill, he hated the bastard. And from what I understand, he split them up. But now that I remember, there were never any kids. No. In fact, the old man-- He still had the wedding photo up, but he cut the son of a bitch's head out. You don't say. Yeah. You know, women-- they're a strange breed. And I tend to take everything that they say with a grain of salt. "Larry Manning. Divorced." [ Cell Phone Rings ] Yeah. Hey, Bud. It's Hank. I got some info on-- Hank, I can't talk right now. Bud, it's important. No. No. I gotta go. What the hell? Hey! Get out of-- Get out of my car, you-- Shh, shh, shh. What do you want? Okay, you want some cash? All right, damn it. All right, no. Here, take-- Listen to me. What? Tell me what happened... to Kaskill and Godfrey, last week at the restaurant. Kaskill-- You were there. What the hell are you talking about? All right. You see this photo? Is this you? And who's the young boy? Think your wife might give me a couple of tips? Fine. Fine. I love photography. What do you want? I asked you a question. What happened between you and Kaskill and Godfrey... the other day at the restaurant? Godfrey wants to buy the son of a bitch out, okay? What do you want to know for? How much? I do-- A lot. Okay? You know, high eight or nine. What, 800,000? 900,000? Million. Okay. Thanks for the info. I'll be in touch. And, uh, don't mention our little talk, or... this might just show up in the mail. Have a nice day. [ Engine Starts ] [ Engine Starts ] Hey. [ Leigh ] Hi. How you doin'? [ Laughs ] What are you doing here? Just came by. Ah. It's quiet. Just-- Why didn't you call? Hey. It's kind of quiet. Where are the kids? What are their names? How old are they? What? What's that? You lied. [ Gasps ] I just-- I didn't-- I lied to you because you would have passed me up like everybody else has. I didn't-- I'm not trying to hurt you, or whatever it is you think I'm trying to do to you. Don't you touch me. Stop it. You snake. Stop. [ Whispering ] Stop. Where's Larry Manning? Huh? Come on. Where's Larry Manning? I was married for a short time. I didn't think that that would matter to you. I mean, what-- Look, I just-- He's a small-time grifter. I haven't seen him in-- in a year. Okay. I need you. I don't have anybody in my life. I need you. Yeah. I'm sorry. [ Gasps ] Do you think that we fall for people that remind us of ourselves? 'Cause you're a lot like me. Yeah. You know, I forgot to tell you... that Kate Winters is pregnant with your dad's kid, so-- Guess you won't be gettin' any of his money too soon, huh? We deserve each other. You need more in your life, Bud. That's why I'm leavin'. I don't wanna be complete. [ Beeps ] [ Morales ] This is Detective Morales. We need some more questions answered, Buddy. Time is running out. [ Machine Beeps ] [ Man On TV, Indistinct ] You know, he's been drinkin' an awful lot lately. And that's sayin' something. I better drive his drunk ass, or he's gonna kill himself. That's a good idea. Hey, don't you think you've had enough for today? Why don't you just drive? I'm just concerned. I'm a grown man. Don't worry about me. So what did you get on that guy from the hotel? Nothin'. What about Godfrey? I don't know. The man can't be found anywhere. Oh, I also checked up on Kaskill's phone records from that night. Yeah? There were two phone calls made that night... before he got back to his office. Who? I don't know. I'm still workin' on that part. Hey, Chip. [ Coughs ] It's me. You know who. You better call me, or you know what's gonna happen. Says we got about an hour before he gets back from lunch. They go to lunch this time every day. Be a while. You guys here on business? No. Vacation? No. The police? Actually, we're just out here looking into a land deal. - Oh, yeah? Whereabout? - Route 2732-- by Wallis Creek. That's some nice land up there. You know, you ought to ask the feds about that area. - They got control of it. - How so? They put a 25-year hands-off order on it. Thousands of acres. It's cheap as hell though. So you can buy a piece of land, but you can't develop it. Well, not for 22 years or so, so you need patience for that. But it's so damn cheap, it's almost like murder. Hey, Bud, what do you say we just come back later? Hey, 74-Down-- "Rose of Guns N' Roses." You-- [ Claire ] Uh, no idea. All right. No biggie. Well, have a nice day. So what was that about? I don't know. What does that fat bastard want with all that land anyway? Especially if he can't develop it. None of this adds up. None of it. Why don't you just ask Leigh? All I get is the machine. You can't find her either, can you? ♪♪ [ Harmonica ] You're late. I'm sorry. I don't know this neighborhood as well as you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So-- Where was Godfrey the night of the murder? Beats me. I'm just an accountant. So Godfrey's out of the company, right? Depends. Considering what happened last week-- We'll know when the will's probated. - So he's pissed off, right? - What do you think? Yeah, he's pissed off. - Where were you? - Come on. - I was with my wife. - [ Bud Chuckles ] Happily married man, huh? Yeah. So, where the hell is Godfrey now? Went on safari a few days back. Been plannin' that for weeks. Safari. Anything else? ♪♪ [ Harmonica ] Hey, it's Bud. [ Leigh ] I was just thinkin' of you. What do you say about heading up to Santa Barbara tonight? Does that sound good to you? Yeah, you get straight to the point. Listen. I just wanna say that I was wrong the other night, so just give me another chance, Leigh. I'll make it up to you.

He sent some info to tell you that he quit. Okay. I'll listen to it later. [ Groans ] See ya. Good night. Nobody ever listens to me. So what happened that night at the warehouse? It's still a little hazy. I went there, and I was just about to go in, but then I heard a couple of shots. [ Gunshots ] It was Jack. - I thought he was in Vail. - Nah.

Motorcycle accident, a year ago. ...brother had an accident? That was completely blown out of proportion. He was just remanded to his mother up in Philadelphia... by his guardian, Leigh Kaskill.

Yeah, that's her. I'm doing it under an assumed name. Draws less attention. Plus, check out today's business section. She sold out the shares she just got. Made a mint. Look, Bud, I don't know what you're hopin' to find, but if you've been had, they knew you and Kaskill inside and out. It's pretty tight. [ No Audible Dialogue ] Surprise. Yeah. It was a lie all along. The job... The old man... The whole thing was a setup. Kate and Leigh set me up from the beginning.
