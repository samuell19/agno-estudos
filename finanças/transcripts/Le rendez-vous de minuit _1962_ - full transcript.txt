Hello Mrs Leuven. She's still only wearing suits by Pierre Balmain? Yes. A new one each time. Have you seen her picture in Vogue's last issue? But who is she? - Kalinga's mines, doesn't ring a bell? Her husband died and she inherited one of Europe's largest fortunes. Is it pronounced Mrs Leuven or Leven? Leuven. Nothing to do with Stendhal for sure. Madam is with the doctor in the living room. You smoke a lot? One or two packs a day. Well... Can you now tell me again precisely what you feel when you have what you call your fits? I told you doctor It happens suddenly. With no cause. Kind of a weight on my chest. An unbearable anguish. Something that tells me that... That I'm gonna die. That I have to die. That I must die. Following a violent strenuous effort? - No, not at all! I do a lot of sports. You live permanently at the hotel. Why? Well, doctor, it's been 10 years Since my husband's death afflicted me with a fortune... Somewhat noticeable. I developed, how could I say, A disgust for property. It's true that nothing here belongs to me. Except one mirror. And at least here, apart from Maria, my personal maid, I only see unknown faces. One last question. You are known to only ever wear white. Is there an explanation to this? It's a habit I took in the South of Tunisia. I was wearing black too, by the way. The only two colors without shades. The colors of the absolute. And of grief. Madam Neither the results of your tests Nor today's examination, allow me to diagnose any kind of trouble With your body Which seems to me as normal as can be And one of the healthiest one could find. I can't see what I could do for you. Maybe, still, some of my colleagues... Perhaps someone like Professor Alcan. A psychiatrist? Doctor, it's my body I'm worried about. If I wanted to take care of my soul, It's a priest I'd go to. Madam Maria To think that I bothered I man like you. It's ridiculous. I don't know what I was thinking. Thank you. Maria, would you please see the doctor to the door. Mr Bob is waiting for you in your room. So, how did the consultation go? Well, my dear... My heart is rock solid. If I was to believe him, it's my brain I should be worried about. But let's discuss more serious matters. Guess what I just bought? The Mercedes. Not the 300? No, the convertible cabriolet. Such lines, such curves! But what are you looking at? My dear, that line, these curves! Don't be vulgar, Bob. No, not now! Bob, you're crazy. Not now. Bob Lovers have meetings that go round with the hands of the clock No, just the last verse. In front of the black and icy waters She is waiting, but it's not him It is Death that comes for her At the midnight rendezvous. Excuse me Madam, I was sitting next you and I had the impression you weren't feeling well. Do you need something? Can I do something to help you? You didn't understand? It's me. But you aren't Lilli Palmer. It is true, however, that you look like her. No. It's a lot more than mere resemblance. If I say this, it's because Tonight She and I It's the same. Yes, it's the same. Because me too Just like in the movie I will kill myself tonight. At midnight. I will kill myself. She's a good customer, you know. She's a very good customer. She's seen every screening since yesterday. You can put aside Mrs Leuven's file. But in the end She doesn't have anything. - Apparently. Still, while with her I was thinking That when our analytical means will get even more advanced Some kind of future electronic machine could analyze The stability of the features, the rhythm of the speech, And could diagnose in her case what I'd call The violent death syndrome. No really, Madam. I can't leave you alone in that condition. I need to be alone. You can't understand. I didn't believe you. I went back to my seat. I couldn't keep watching the movie. I suddenly got scared for you. Anyway, I am of no interest. What do you want from me? Nothing. Just be helpful. You can approach a woman without expecting anything. Only because she's a human being. Listen. Let me talk to you. Believe me When we have ideas like you have in mind You need to talk to someone. Let's not stay in the streets. Let's go in there for a while. We'll be comfortable. At least accept that I offer you a drink. You can see I have no bad intentions. What can I serve you? A beer. No, make it a cognac. I'll have a quart Perrier. My name is Jacques Moreau. I'm not asking for your name, I'm not curious. But... I need to understand people. It's kind of my job. So I would like to know if I understood you correctly. Tell me, this movie... You already knew the ending? You'd already seen it? So when you tell me that she is you What you mean is that You have the same problems as this woman? That you've lived through the same tragedy? And that's why you have this absurd idea of killing yourself? Not at all! It's not at all like that woman. Even the complete opposite. She has millions. I don't have much money. Besides, I don't care. Her, she has many lovers And me I never make love anymore. Excuse me one second. Hello? - Hello. Is that you my love? - Yes, it's me. Nobody called for me? -No. We got some mail. Where are you calling me from? I thought you went to the movies. Yes, but I met friends coming out of the theater. We went out for a drink. What about your article? Oh well, they'll tell me about the movie. It doesn't look too good. Everything's fine? - The kids are asleep. Christian is a sweetheart, Sophie has a fever. You want me to come home? Oh no, no reason to come home. Have fun with your friends. Listen. I'll still try to get rid of them. That's so nice of you. But don't worry my love. If you're not back by 11, I'll just go to sleep. I only have Gitane, but if you prefer something else, it's not far. No, thanks. I don't smoke. I like this little bar. I often come here to work. I find the place perfectly quiet. Even surrounded by noise, you feel... Protected. Isolated. Those placing horse racing bets. The card players. The one who writes letters in the corner. All that's missing is a couple of lovers. A beautiful rose for only 100 francs. To make your lady happy. Take it, it's my last one. Only 100 francs. No, I'll pay for the rose. One cannot offer alcohol and roses at the same time. I already had a second drink. Röslein, Röslein Roth Goethe? You prefer Ronsard: The rose which this morning had opened its purple dress in the sun. Or maybe Shakespeare. The rose looks fair, but fairer it we deem / For that sweet odor which doth in it live. You speak French, English and German? But all three with a bad accent. So I'm not an interpreter. You often go to the movies? Almost never. But then, this movie... Why go back and see every screening? So you know? Yes, the cashier told me. It's true. I went yesterday evening I stayed for the second screening. I went back today and I stayed the whole day. It makes no sense. You haven't done anything else? Yes, this morning, I was looking for a suit. I found one, completely white. Exactly what I was looking for. I too often have to go see a movie multiple times. In general, it doesn't change anything. - On the contrary. It's extraordinary, magic. Precisely because we always see the same thing. Theater is like a game. One night, the actor can say or do something differently than usual. In movies, things never change. A film looks like it is... Like it is fatal. No. No, you have a better word for that in French. It looks like it is... In... Inevitable. - Inevitable, that's it. Nothing can stop it from running its course. That I understood. It needs To go To its end. You don't know what it is to see a movie four times. You know it by heart. You wait every second for what's going to happen. And even if you get out of the screening It goes on. It doesn't leave you. For example At this very moment She's at the car rally. In her big white car. Be careful, slow down. Slow down! Madam, are you ok? Carry on! Just carry on, you fool! If I get behind, that's good for you. Ok, fine. This Jacqueline, because she has a law degree... Gently, gently... Oh, leave me alone! Jackie's little Italian is a charming man. He's her fiancé. Her "Jules" like the young girls say. He's a young Venetian student who teaches her Italian. Dear Jacqueline, she drives miraculously. With such grace. Her grace is to be 18 years old. We can't say the same about Anne. That one thinks she can drive because she sleeps with a car racer! Yes, you see It's one kilometer after the junction of the national road. Oh yes, where it says Cassis. Jacqueline! I was a little nervous earlier, I'm sorry. It's no problem, Madam. On the contrary I must have made a very bad impression on your friend. Would you mind introducing us? Gianino Ferzati, Mrs Henry Leuven. You are Italian Sir, and from Venice. Yes, Madam. What a wonderful city. I discovered it a little foolishly, on my honeymoon. A long time ago. But I've always kept a mirror that I found there. Near the San Giorgio bridge. You must come for lunch someday. With Jacqueline. So you can tell me more about your city. I'm afraid, Madam, that we aren't talking about the same city. Sure, tourists love our Venetian glassware But they don't know that fifty percent Of our glassblowers are suffering from tuberculosis at 40 years old. You don't like frivolous women, Mr Gianino. Oh, Madam That's not what I meant. Your friend is very charming, Jacqueline. Especially when he's mad. Getting married, Maria? You? But it's not possible! What does that mean? Come sit here and confess to me. Who is it? The little brown haired boy you were with at Christmas? No, Madam. This one, it's serious. You don't know him. I thought you were my friend and you keep this from me? What does he do? He works in mechanics But that's perfect, I need a driver! The thing is, he doesn't want me to work anymore. So I wanted to inform Madam that I could no longer be at her service. Maria, you know too well that I can't do without you. It's Bob, I'm not here. Nor tonight. Hello. It's the maid speaking. Yes, this is Maria Sir. No, Mrs Leuven isn't here. This afternoon? I don't know, I think she went to the countryside. I think this would be a good time to disappear to the Balearic Islands. Oh, I look terrible this morning. Would you like to go to the Balearic Islands, Maria? It's not far away from your country. Balearic... In the meantime, I will have to write my article. Be nice and help me. Since you know this movie by heart, tell me about it. It's not something you can describe. It must be seen. Oh, if one had to see every movies to be able talk about them... Luckily, producers think of everything. See... Right here. You'll see how we do when we haven't seen a movie. It's the screenplay? Just wait. Can you open the lights? Toison D'or productions secured exclusive film rights For the adaptation of the music record bestseller "Midnight rendezvous". Making a movie based on a song, now that's something. In a loose adaptation, the famous song becomes a tragic and eventful movie Showcasing the talent and beauty of Lilli Palmer. For the sake of realism, several scenes were filmed in real Parisian settings. Most notably at the picturesque small bistro L'ami Isidore. L'ami Isidore, 11 Ste-Foy Square. The place is real? With a red frontage, in front of plane trees? It's right in the neighborhood. Not the fanciest place. Let's go there. I want to see it. To get to Mirabeau bridge, it's a detour. It's no problem, we'll leave the taxi there. I'll walk back home. You seriously want to go there? You don't want to. True. Maybe someone is waiting for you home. You know, in my profession, we get home at any hour. If it makes you happy... Well, Driver To L'ami Isidore! There's nobody here. Closed on Fridays. It's a lovely little spot. It feels like countryside. You wouldn't think you're 50 meters away from the boulevards. It's not the same at all. There were lights, people having dinner, there was noise. Oh yeah, I can imagine. Anne Leuven in a low-cut dress, curing her melancholia with Beaujolais. Not at all, she was serving in the kitchen. I don't understand. Unless the mines of Kalinga were emptied. Still... The ruined billionaire, that's a bit much. Don't make fun of it. I told you, I cannot describe this movie. But had you seen her performance... Here. Well, my dear... You really don't mind! But it's not possible, Maria... Why didn't you tell me anything? And then, at the end... Like this. No! No, let me be! There's nothing left. And now, everywhere and forever, people will hear her laugh and cry. When you say "her" You're thinking of Anne Leuven or... of that actress who looks like you? Why are you asking me that? Do you have a light? I hate whores. It shows we're near Les Halles. Well, Sir. I think you can leave me now. You think so? I'd prefer to go back home alone. Have a good evening. Help! Help! He's going to kill him! Stop! Agreed, Commissioner. See you right away. So, you shall put the body in the small room. Okay, I'm on it. What does this all mean? What it means is you'll have to sit on that bench and wait. I'm telling you again, we just happened to be there. Anyway, you're the only two witnesses to the crime. The assistant commissioner is coming back and will question you. You see what death is? Real death. You who were talking about killing yourself. What a strange evening. To think we could be quietly sitting in our seats. Watching that movie. [In Italian]: I like you a lot. Anne, I love you. I love you. Tell me "I love you*". [tu] Yes, little Gianino, I love you*. [vous] Tell me "I love you" [tu], not "I love you" [vous]. I love you [tu]. It's silly, Gianino! But seriously, I assure you I can't say that to anybody. That's the way I am, I can't help it. But why? - I don't know. My father was a notary in Brittany. My parents addressed each other formally And I'd do the same. Even to my spaniel. If I were English, I could at least be familiar to God. But I was taught to say "Our Heavenly Father". Try, at least. Just this once. But that's childish! I'm sure you were quite familiar to Jacqueline! It has nothing to do with childishness! Workers are familiar to one another. My little proletarian... - Oh, laugh all you want. I had lots of jobs. I unloaded crates. I even was a dishwasher in a restaurant near Les Halles. I may have had more real friends then than today in college. I somewhat pity you. If you can't be familiar to anybody It's that you never got your hands dirty. And you don't think I could? I'd bet the opposite, you don't know me well. You'd really want my hands to be dirty? [In Italian]: Leave me alone! [In Italian]: Don't be angry, Gianino. [In Italian]: You want me to tell you, [In Italian]: I can't do it in French. [In Italian]: But you see, [In Italian]: I can do it very well in Italian. [In Italian]: The beautiful language of Dante. Come here my little Gianino. [In Italian]: I like you a lot. [In Italian]: I like you a lot. Can I make a phone call? - A phone call? Why? To whom? I must warn my newspaper, I can't stay here. Journalist or not, you'll do like everyone else! We're fed up with the press! You better change your tone with me! Oh no, Dear Lord, no. Calm down now! What's all this fuss? What is it, Chargot? It's starting to pour down. It's the storm that makes you nervous? You haven't been here for 30 minutes. When the commissioner gets here, we'll let you know. Under the Mirabeau bridge, [she quotes Apollinaire] Flows the Seine, and our loves! A 1.6 million banco, gentlemen. Who makes the banco? Banco! - The banco is made. No cards. - No, no cards. The bank wins. And Six. You've lost. A 3.2 million banco, gentlemen. With one burned card. Who makes the banco? With the table. Banco. - Banco! Followed. But she has no seven. Who is she playing against? Nobody knows him. He arrived 3 days ago and he's only been winning since. He looks like he's dead. Eight. All square. One card. Let's continue, Sir. Card. Card. The bank stays. You've lost, Madam. A 6.4 million banco, gentlemen. Who makes the banco? The hand is at one card. Banco. - The banco is made, gentlemen. Banco, Sir. The hand passes. Staff. Thank you, Madam. The hand passes to the table. The hand passes to the table. (x2) - Taken. The hand is free. A 6.4 million banco, gentlemen. Who's in? Banco. - The banco is made. Sir? Nine for the player. Jacques Moreau? The commissioner wants to see you This way. Is that exactly it? Yes, Commissioner. Come. Sit down. Jacques Moreau, journalist. Born in Paris on July 23rd, 1925. Residing at 16, Tournon Street. And rhetoric student at Henry IV college. Don't you recognize me? Blouquier. Of course! I recognized you at first glance. I'm good at remembering faces. Part of the job. I was first in class in literature, and you failed all writing assignment. And now you're the writer. And I'm a policeman. PhD in law, nevertheless. Yes. Yes. Very good. Nothing else was reported? Ok. Well, I think your case will be settled. I've read a few of your articles. Not bad. And you were with Madam? When it happened? Yes, we were completely surprised. It's not what she says. She just left you. Oh, barely 30 seconds before. Ok. And... You know Madam well? No. We just met tonight. We met at the movie theater. Perfect place to start... a friendship. Moreover, Madam's identity card is perfectly in order. And your testimony backs up her statement. I sent an agent to check on her address, And I was just told it's valid. Now, it only concerns the judicial police. You might both be called in for the investigation. I will be released? Well, yes Madam. Administrative practices are not always exactly like those in the series novels. But can you... I mean, can you tell me what the crime is? Was the murderer arrested? Was it a crime of passion? Or some kind of score-settling. Ah, it's obvious you got in journalism through literature. That you didn't have to cover roadkills and petty crimes. Paris is actually the safest capital in Europe. Stories like that happen every night. Ah, of course, it's not as romantic as a crime of passion or an assassination. Know that you friend Jacques is a romantic. He already was when I met him at 16 years old. Chamoix? You want to come? Here's your two identity cards. Now I have to make you go through a painful formality You must sign a declaration certifying that you do not know the victim. Would you please take Mrs. and Mr. to identify the corpse. Take a look when outside to our Renaissance style staircase. My police station is listed as historical monument. I'll admire his Renaissance staircase some other time. Where can I get a taxi cab? It's no use. I live just nearby. Yet, you told me you lived near the Mirabeau bridge. Why did you lie? I don't know. It's... how can I say? A whim. Hey there! To say we've been saying for 20 years we should take Les Halles out of Paris. Better take me out of Les Halles, right away. After that, we just need to cross Rivoli street. Thank you. Thank you also for earlier. You were very classy towards me. Oh, hold on, about this... I forgot to give you back your ID card. Eva... That's German for Eve. Yes. My first name is German. But my surname, Crowley, Is of Hungarian origin. The people of my village have had three nationalities in thirty years Austrian. Czech. And then German. Well, now you are Parisian. I am now in Paris, like I was in Rome, like I was in Buenos Aires. It's the police! No, it's nothing at all. Look, it's the Republican guard. Why were you so afraid? You were not afraid seeing the corpse earlier. The police always reminds me of the Gestapo. In Hitler's time, before I got away. France Soir! Paris Press! Ask for France Soir! Thank You. France Soir! Paris Press! I saw right away that you were a journalist. Why? Because you made a phone call. A phone call. When? At the cafe. When you called your newspaper. My newspaper? Stand there, there's less rain. I'm afraid it is soaked. Well, for once the press will have been useful at something. That's sure sign for a lousy Summer. Summer? - Yes, we're 21st of June now. You wanted to kill yourself on the first day of Summer. You know, I know everything about suicide. I did research for an article. And I assure you that it is comforting and almost comical. 75% of attempts fail. I don't know what you were considering, But I would have advised against the gas stove. Hard to find anyway. Hanging is no better, and worst of all, the Eiffel tower. Only one in 3000 cases. We mostly kill ourselves in Spring or in Fall. 40% are old people. And 25% are less than 20 years old. That is to say that in this season, and at your age... Mathematically, you only had a tiny chance of succeeding. It's nice to see you smile, at last. Listen... Tell me the truth. You really wanted to die? Yes. When did you make the decision? Maybe when I told you so. You can't be serious. You think? It looks like it stops. It's here. But you're soaked... You have to come in and get dry. Come. You live in a very beautiful house. Oh you can talk louder. There's only offices on the first floor. Offices in a Louis XV hotel? There's still a few more stairs. Watch out, there's two stairs. Oh please don't look. This mess is shameful. There's a nice view when it's not raining. Give me your coat. And your shirt too. Yes, yes. I'll turn on the heater. Bring me a chair. To dry it. Meanwhile, I'm going to change. And even take a burning hot shower. Close the door please. I'm already in the shower. She's here. I usually recognize her steps. She's always alone. So alone. You're a friend of hers? No, we met by chance. And then, we got caught by the storm. You don't know her more than that. She already got home after midnight yesterday. And today, impossible to talk to her. What's with her? Police asked for her earlier, the concierge told me. I'm sure she didn't do anything wrong. She's as pure as daylight. Stop her from drinking. Ah, this light is terrible. Turn it off. No, no. It's not dry yet. Don't be afraid. You look great shirtless. You remind me of the students from my country. When they go fight in duel. You're not in a hurry. Sit down. It's my turn to offer you a drink. It's true that you like Perrier, I like pure whiskey. Me too, sometimes. You were lucky to find this studio. It's not a studio. It's two former maid's rooms, I knocked down the wall. Thank you. - I'm glad you like it. I'll put on some music. Maybe... You won't like it much. Lovers have meetings, that go round with the hands of the clock. On the watch, full noon or daybreak. No matter what hour strikes, here is love in person. To meet together, Any time is wonderful. You can dance to it. It's a valse. But my favorite moment, Is when the moon shines in the sky The passing minute Of the midnight rendezvous. Quite often in the light shades Our two intertwined steps towards the old bridge went away. Have now been gone for so long. After the joy comes the sadness, Is it my fault or his? Yesterday a suspicion broke The last of our kisses. Between evening and dawn, When tomorrow chases today away. Will I find him again? At our midnight rendezvous. Your shirt is on fire! Here, bring me the sofa cushions. We will sit here. Get comfortable. I'll go get something to drink. Aren't we a lot better? You want to get me drunk? You know, I have a strong head. You won't teach me to drink. You think so? You know about brüderschaft? No. I don't like Germans. But they have this wonderful thing. It's their way of toasting. Pass your arm. Like this. There. And we drink together, in one straight shot. And once we've done brüderschaft, we are in good terms for life. You can smoke a cigarette. I never smoke. But I like to see the smoke. I like fire too. I remember when I was young. The big fires that the peasants lit in the mountains. It was night. It was almost cold. I pressed myself against my father. And the peasants were signing. It was the summer solstice. And today, On the 21st of June, without knowing, you lit our St-John's day fire. What about you? You don't want to tell me stories from your youth? Me, when I was a kid Before I went to sleep, my mother Would take my head And she'd say Golden forehead. Heavenly eyes. Iron nose. Silver mouth. Flowery chin. That is so nice. Do it again. Golden forehead. Heavenly eyes. Iron nose. Silver mouth. Flowery chin. Golden shoulders. Shut up, you're crazy. - Eva, listen to me. No, no. - Yes, listen. No. Golden shoulders. Velvet back. Shut up, shut up! No! Jacques, no, no, Jacques, stop it. - Eva... Jacques, no, leave me be. Perfectly round knee. No, no, no, no... Nein! I'm sorry... I thought someone called. You could have locked the door, you know. I'm going to get dressed. Last week I saw an amazing western. - I don't like it. Doesn't look too bad, unless it's completely stupid. It's too late, it already started. Oh, but a movie can start at any point. Hey, go get me a dish towel. You're afraid of getting your legs tired? Hey, oh, fatty! Don't mind me! The little dove doesn't like to coo? Only after my shift. How can you be so friendly with the chef? Where did you work before? Only in expensive hotels. Maria! What are you doing here? I'm here to tell them who you are. Yes, who really took my place tonight. Come on, Maria... She's a billionaire. She got hired for the fun of it. On my wedding day, you sent me for 20 000 francs of flowers. And then, nothing. For 5 years, I chose your dresses with you. You told me every one of your secrets. I've know all of your lovers. Now, I'll tell you what all your friends think since they dare not tell you. To you, others just don't exist. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, all of you! Marie-Louise! Marie-Louise! It's awful! Madame Leuven... I notified the concierge. Oh, come with me. I can't see her like this. Don't leave me alone. Sleeping pills. I took the liberty of warning you right away, Professor. You can come. Oh, you'll send someone? Do nothing until he's here? Thank you, Professor. What's happening? Come on, don't be secretive, I love dramas. I'm a writer myself. Oh, I know who you are, Mr. Nérisse. Well, it's Mrs. Leuven. Veronal. Anne Leuven... What a character this woman is... This tobacco is terrible. What is this masquerade? What are you trying to do? Don't you think that's enough? In the nervous state you're in, It might be better not to drink. You like lecturing people? Are you certain you're a journalist and not a priest or pastor? Don't you think you can approach a woman without expecting anything from her? Just because she's a human being? People say that, right? And then, little by little, you try to sleep with her. Oh please... I wouldn't have had to rape you! You're a swine. I think I'm an idiot. I've been ridiculous all night long. First, to take you seriously. Then, to behave like a kid. Good night. You can continue to ramble. You can even throw yourself out the window. I'm not going to stop you. I don't believe a word you said. It's all been an act from the start. An act? An act... But haven't you guessed yet? Ariane, my sister, [she quotes Racine] wounded by what love? You died on the shores where you were abandoned. No, I wasn't Phaedra. I played the servant. But it already was too good for me. There's blood on it still. [sic] [she quotes Shakespeare] All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. I wasn't Lady Macbeth. I was the third witch. After that, I did plays where I only had to say: "Madame is served". And at the end... My name wasn't even on the posters anymore. Yet... At our little theater in college when I was a young girl... They said I could be a great actress. But it is difficult to succeed when you are a refugee abroad. Always with the accent! Yes, I did tours. Seedy tours. In every countries. It's hard to make a living when you're a bad actress. When you're getting older. And you don't want to be a whore. I've been 6 years without a single role. Even as an extra. It's over. It's over. Isn't it true that I look like her? She's wonderful. Why her and not me? So... All of a sudden, I told myself... That I wanted to see myself in her costume. Playing her part. But better. Like... No actress ever did. To play it 'til the end, for real. But that's absurd. That's no reason for killing yourself. You think I don't have other reasons? To end it all? That Anne Leuven... She ended up old and alone. And me... In college, I studied medicine. Oh, ok. That's why I thought you were a doctor. And when I had to change craft, I became a nurse. Oh, it's not a bad job. I'm not starving. But if you knew what it is. Giving injections all day long. And going home alone at night in a maid's room. With for neighbors, a plumber and a crazy old woman. The one that got in? Oh dear Lord, what she must have thought... She adores me as if I were the holy virgin. To think that she sent me to see this film! It's just like you as a blonde, she told me. The only love That I found A nut Who drinks only water And who stands on her head to say her prayers. Otherwise, only men who sometimes want to love me too much. Eva... - No, don't touch me! I almost believed you and you ruined everything! It's worst than it was! Leave, I beg you. Leave, I want to be alone. Ok, I'll go now. It's true that I couldn't do anything for you. I was so clumsy that I only succeeded in driving you to despair a little more. Why did you call me a slime? Because of what happened earlier? But it's only proof that you're still beautiful. I'm not of those who look for affairs and flings. And after all... There's nothing wrong in wanting to make love. Earlier, at the cafe It's my wife that I called, not the newspaper. And I told her I was coming home. And yet, it was not out of pity that I followed you. Nor even out of curiosity, no. It's that... There's something about you that I liked right away. In your eyes. In the way you talk. Please understand, I love my wife deeply. And I look forward to going to Venice with her, In two months for the biennial. But something that matters happened between us. You know very well, Eva. Something amazing. Something beautiful. Listen... Two people who don't know anything about each other meet Without knowing why, they're attracted to one another. They even hurt each other, as we did. And then, In less than an hour. They reach a kind of absolute knowledge. Much deeper than what you get with a friend after talking for years. Goodbye, Eva. In 10 years, we won't have forgotten a thing about this evening. You're going back To your home? No. I think I'll go watch the end of that film. It would be more reasonable. Eva, come with me. I saw you overwhelmed by this movie. I wouldn't want to leave you without seeing you smile at the screen. Without making sure you have no more of these stupid ideas. Will you come with me? See, you're already smiling. But we'll get there too late. The movie is also playing at the Champs-Élysées. It's closer to my newspaper and the Subway is right there. It's not the sin of the flesh. It's a sin against the soul. Of which the Gospel say that it will not be forgiven. The crime of pride. And it's a terrible one, Madam. To try to destroy, with your hands, your own person. God's creature. Before anything else, swear not to think about taking your own life again. Swear. Please forgive me, father. Please, is this the road to Paris? You go down and make a right turn. I lost my virginity, While tending my sheep. He opened my bodice, To look at my titties. I don't know when nor where. To a tune, a bagpipe tune. Dreary. Don't you think, Mark? Should we go? And it wasn't the wind, That lifted my skirt. I must admit it, It was the rascal's hand. She's funny. I love these amateur contests. You've seen that couple? Pierre Nérisse? He's as pretentious as his plays. Make brothel girls talk in verse? I thought you were avant-gardiste? You weren't invited to the premiere? See? Beautiful people. Oh, snobs who must have been bored at Florence. Oh, but that's her. In a still soft fluff, He found the bird in its nest. Hook. I don't know when nor where. Hook! Hook! Ah, what do you want, the public decides. Too bad, let's applaud her all the same. Lights! Let's go on with the amateur bawdy song contest. Who is our next competitor? But you're crazy, my dear! But you know, Madame Leuven, it's faked. They're all artists disguised as amateurs to satisfy our clientele. Am I allowed to take part? Yes or no? Yes! Yes! But she didn't drink anything. - Her? She gets drunk on water [Vittel]. She's so aggressive since her suicide attempt. Oh really, she's going too far. I'm also Breton, but a real one. I don't know if my song qualifies as bawdy. Probably more obscene. But I find it... Quite beautiful. Girls from Camaret, All pretend to be virgins. Girls from Camaret, All pretend to be virgins. But once they're in my bed, They prefer my cock, To a church candle. To a church candle! To a church candle. Our bed curtains, Are made of red serge. Our bed curtains, Are made of red serge. And when we get in, The rage... [coughing] It's intolerable! Please stop this scandal! Admirable, Madam. You were admirable. In your opinion, what's the most important quality? For a man or a woman? For either one. For me, I would say it's lucidity. I mean, never lie to yourself. And for you? I think it's faithfulness. I don't mean not cheating on your husband. But to be faithful to who you are. True. It's kind of the same. No. Anne Leuven, for example. She lies to herself. Yet, deep down, she's faithful to herself. Why are you smiling? You are strange. You claim it's the actress that fascinates you in that movie. You can't stop thinking about the character she plays. As if it was a real character. - Exactly. It's when you don't know anymore. It's when there's no difference between the actress and her character That it's beautiful. You make me want to see the end of that movie. You'll be disappointed. - Sorry, getting out. How many stops to go? Two, I think. Sometimes in the train, even in the Subway, I wish it would never stop. Ah! These St-Germain nights! Do you know who is St-Germain? I must admit I don't. Well, he's a bishop of Paris, a 4th century bishop. He excommunicated, for incest, Caribert, the lazy King. The play That we had the honor to play for you For the first time Is from Pierre Nérisse. I don't quite see why you take it so badly. Pierre, my darling, don't use that tone with me, I beg you. Supplications at 11 in the morning. Clearly, I came at the wrong time. But you don't know what this trip with you to Venice meant to me. You know, I don't particularly like honeymoons. Honestly, I can't see us in a gondola. Oh so you think I can only appreciate Venice for its touristic scenery? Oh, no, no, no, I know, I know... Your working-class Venice. Your blood spitting glassblowers. Unfortunately, social realities bore me as much as serenades. Pierre, you're going with Mark? I don't really see what this young man has to do with it? I think I forgot my gloves in the living room. Pierre! Pierre? Please, excuse me. Of course, you are free. Free to go where you want. But it's absurd to part like that. Sit down for a moment. You know, I've seen Villedieu. And I think our ballet can be staged in July. Pierre? Listen, I think it is now time for us to come clean. Oh no, no. Yes, Yes. I'm going to Venice. Alone. I'm going to Venice to be alone. Well, what do you think a writer is? I need to work, yes. My little table. With my glasses. I can't find inspiration drinking Whiskey every night until dawn. No, no. How can you say that? Don't spoil everything. We were happy, often. Wonderfully happy. - Certainly. I really liked you, Anne. I love your fantasy. The quality of your extravagance. Your extraordinary youth. But what can I do? I'm tired. And there's a time for everything. I know what I owe you. Without you, that stingy old Valard wouldn't have put on my play. Why talk about that? Because it feels like there was An eternal companionship clause in the contract. Well no. There wasn't. We're not married for life, as you say. Discourteously, by the way. Anyway, I'm sure that when I get back from Venice, we'll laugh about it all. Please don't go, Pierre! Pierre. Come back. Hello? Can I speak to Mr. Pierre Nérisse? How old is your child? Ah... Thank you. Barman, have you seen Mr. Nérisse tonight? It's you who got in without a ticket. She ran off, but I've got you. Where did she go? I need to find her. You'll see what it will cost you. But that's stupid. I'm a journalist. Let go of me, I have a green card. You should have said so, Sir. Where are you running to, Jacques Moreau? The wise walk with an even step and without haste Sorry, Alberich. Have you seen a woman in a white suit? I just lost her. A poet doesn't chase women. Women should follow him. Isn't it so, little girl? Let me introduce you. The famous Jacques Moreau. Miss Fifine. Who will be famous. A future actress. A stupid kid. Come on, let's have a drink. No, I really need to find her. No woman... Nor any metaphysical concern, can break the union of friendship and poetry. And the possibility of a lemon rum. Let's go. It's absurd. I had this stupid run-in with the ticket inspector. I got out of the theater. Looked for her on the sidewalk. And that's when I saw you. Thank you. And now... I must admit that drinking with you on the Champs-Élysées, I wonder if any of it really happened. If it was all a dream. How can we distinguish reality from imagination? Ah, I said without ice! Your story is only normal. Oscar Wilde said that nature imitates art. Today it's life that imitates cinema. Here. Look at this newsstand. Who says there isn't a documentary filmmaker pointing his invisible camera at us, right now? If we're not, unknowingly, part of a movie? We're being filmed? My mirror. My bag. Ah... There it is, under your raincoat. My raincoat? Oh yes, I forgot... But it's hers... She's the one who forgot it and ran away. La belle jardinière. [The beautiful gardener] In any case, this one doesn't dress at Balmain. There's a letter. We might be able to solve the mystery. The envelope is empty. Eva Crowley. It comes from the experimental laboratory on Cherche-Midi street. She really is a nurse. Here. A nurse! Don't try to tell us you didn't do her in the maid's room. I assure you. The craziest thing is that it might be true. You have a lovely wife who adores you. You're handsome. Women like you. Yes, look at the way Fifine looks at you. But you are the last of the puritans Jacques, the Huguenot. You hear me? What are you looking at? Oh, it's Lilli Palmer. Right, you weren't at the cocktail party for the film's release. I will introduce you. You can tell her your story, she'll have a laugh. Shut up. She looked better in the movie. And you, what do you think? Eva is completely different. - Eva, again. Don't tell us that you're in love with this boozy and mythomaniac nurse who thinks she's a movie heroine? I thought this film was stupid. We don't even know why she kills herself. Ah, I would on the contrary defend that ambiguity. Anne Leuven kills herself for a thousand reasons. Her age, ethics, her golden solitude. Regrets due to an impossible motherhood. And in the end, be it with her friends or lovers, Her inability to communicate with others. Here am I, writing your review. But he's not listening to me. What are you thinking about? I wonder where can Eva be now. Maybe at the midnight rendezvous. And it's you she's waiting for. What do you mean? Maybe he hasn't seen the scene with the letter. The last love letter from Anne Leuven. Wait, wait... Pierre... I'm alone, but I'm not asking for love anymore Just a little tenderness. If you don't come tonight, where we had our first date, I'll kill myself at midnight, like in the song. Where is that rendezvous? - Oh that, I don't know. You haven't seen the end? No! This imbecile pushed me out to avoid the rush. The poet must precede the crowd. I'm sure it's just to piss me off, to keep me from seeing the end of the film. Where are you going? Miss, I beg you, tell me how this ends. Where does she kill herself? I need to know right away, this is very serious. She throws herself in the Seine, at the Mirabeau bridge. Look, here comes your friend. Give me your car keys, I'll be right back. I need it to go to St-Germain-des-prés. I swear I'll bring it back in an hour. Hey! Watch out for third gear, she's hard to shift. Where is he going? In search for adventure. Night is beautiful. He will eventually go back to his marital nest. To his sweet loving wife. Tell me, have you seen a woman? A woman dressed in white? The white lady's looking at you. A brown haired woman! She is brown haired, she is blonde, she is auburn too. Eva! Eva! So, you saw the lady in white? No. She didn't come. Under the Mirabeau bridge Flows the Seine,and our loves. Subs by MemorialBBQ Our evening ends with this film from Roger Leenhardt.
