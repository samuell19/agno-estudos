What the fuck are you doing? Fuck you! Oh, my God! Stop! Stop! Good morning to you all. Good morning out there. Good morning to all of you. On this Monday... Yeah, it's Monday. A case of the Mondays. I am on my third cup of coffee. Anybody else having a hard time this morning? Drivers are expected to experience record congestion today. Around 100 workers are losing their jobs. Are you feeling stressed out these days? Hey, guess what? Join the club. Violent altercations can happen from even the most minor lapses by drivers. I've posted every day, ten times a day, for three years now. Too many people out there think they can multitask while operating a vehicle. Incivility is a major issue in America. Rudeness can breed more rudeness. We were born angry. And with anger comes a lack of self-control. When you're very angry, you lose a lot of self-control. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Oh, my... - Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Aggressive driving's been on the rise for several years, and that's due to societies moving faster... Road-rage fatalities have skyrocketed 500%. A simple ride-share trip yesterday took a horrific turn. Local law enforcement is understaffed with no new applicants in sight. It's getting real bad out there. People are taking matters into their own hands. Seeing this live right now. The police have him cornered. We're in the middle of a standoff here. I knew it wasn't going to end well. You gotta protect yourself these days. No one else is gonna help you. We've been married 15 years, we have three kids, and my husband's been cheating on me for years. A man who is thought to be the main suspect... Issues surrounding mental health are increasing by the day. Inequality is pushing us farther and farther apart. We are going backwards. Thousands of police officers have been laid off since... It's a nationwide epidemic right now. It could be years before they can afford to hire more officers. ...searching for a suspect... Gas prices were up 82 cents today. Ambulance response rates are slowing down. Stress levels are at an all-time high. ...all the warning signs of impending collapse. When we reach our boiling point and we explode... In the streets with counter-protestors. - We blame the media, Twitter, Facebook. - We feel all that strain... It's definitely a problem that we're facing... Takes a toll on your relationships. ...your health and well-being. Why is everything filled with such garbage? People have so much coming at them, their brains just can't handle it. Andy? Hello. You up? I am now. Well, that's good, 'cause your soon-to-be ex filed another motion. What's he want now? Just say it. He wants the house. Of course he does. Listen, I'm already drawing up our objection. Shit. I didn't set my alarm. Hey, I just need you to tell me to file it, okay? - Rach? - I need to think about it. What? Come on. I just want this to be over. Rachel, you need to fight this, and you know that. Come on. Richard didn't work for the house. You did. Hey, I gotta go. Okay, but we're continuing this conversation at lunch. Yeah. You're the best. - I know it. - Bye. Shouldn't you be dressed? What, this is not appropriate attire for your personal chauffeur? - You have a client. - No, I don't. I mean, yes, I do. But, you know, we're still good. - It just means we've got... - Another tardy. No, we're good. Okay? Yeah. No, I know. I... I get it. I know you don't like living there, but it's an assisted-living community, Mom, it's not an old folks' home. Can you hear me? Can you... Okay, Mom, you need... I can't hear you. You need to press the little microphone button. It's... ...firefighters battle a raging house fire... Mom, you need to... You need to press the little microphone button with the... I don't know if you can hear me. I'm gonna come see you later, okay? Um... Bye. Police are actively searching now for the homeowner's ex-husband, who was last seen fleeing the scene in a gray pickup truck early this morning. Our own Pat Davereaux spoke with a neighbor about the suspect's history of substance abuse and violence after a workplace injury. She had a restraining order on him. And now she's gone. He just couldn't face it. - I was watching that. - It's way too early for real life, dude. Anybody seen my candy-cane scissors? Now, why would you want to cut candy canes? You know. My scissors with the... Never mind. Is she okay? I think so. Gonna be late again. Found 'em. Under one of your piles of trash. Hey, science has proven that piles are the most efficient filing system. I read that somewhere. Those are actually my coupons. - Were you cutting us coupons? - Mm-hmm. - I love you. - Mm. Rachel, maybe you could learn a thing or two from Mary about fiscal responsibility. - Rachel, I... I'm sorry. - It's okay. I really love having you and my brother here. But if you're so fiscally responsible, maybe it's time to kick in some rent here. Rachel, you're the one that said that we couldn't stay at Mom's. We need to sell it. And you know that. Okay? I can't afford to pay for her care, and you really can't either. No, no, I told you, I'm working on the business and it's gonna start soon. Come on, Freddy, we gotta be real. Real about what? What does that even mean? She was getting lost in her own neighborhood. But to be fair, I still get lost in our old neighborhood. - Even with a phone? - Yeah. Yeah, the streets in Linwood Springs are like a freakin' maze of spaghetti. Kyle, grab a granola bar. We gotta go. I already ate. Bye, guys. See you after school. See you, dude. Blow it up in there. Bye, buddy. Morning, Rachel. Hey, Kyle. Morning, Rosie. New ride? Yeah. We've gone minivan. It suits you. Bye. Are we ever gonna get a new ride? Sure. You wanna buy me one? "Prospective." Mom, I'm good. Remember, it's not "per-spective." "Prospective." P-R-O-S-P-E-C-T-I-V-E. - "Prospective." - Nice job. Hey, so what do you say? Should we risk the freeway today? No. No freeway. Okay, well, just check the traffic for me, please. You don't have a pass code anymore? Not since I almost crashed trying to unlock it. Wow. That's not safe. - "Precarious." - What? Next word. "Precarious." "Precarious." P-R-E-C-A-R-I-O-U-S. - Use it in a sentence. - Uh... The way the glass is placed on the edge of the table is precarious. Nice. Good job. Says it's clear. And that's a problem why? Because we still can't trust it. - Sorry, kiddo, but today we must. - Mom, no! - I don't have a choice. - No! Please? - We're gonna be late. - Trust me, Kyle. This is gonna be quicker, okay? That's what you said the last two times. Hey, see? All clear. It's Dad. Can I please talk to him? - Hey, Dad. - Hey, man. Uncle Freddy and I invented a new Fortnite strategy. - You wanna hear it? - Not a good time. - Maybe later, okay? - Okay. You got the tickets for the game tomorrow? Yeah, look, about the game... My schedule kind of got messed up, and my boss needs me to go out of town tomorrow. - Next time, okay? - Yeah, okay. That's really understanding of you, Kyle. You know, new jobs, like your Dad's, can be... really unpredictable at first. See. That's right. But I promise we'll make a plan to go to a game soon... Well, it probably shouldn't be planned. It should be more a... a spur-of-the-moment thing, right? I mean, 'cause plans... can be hard to stick to. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I just need to keep my new boss happy so I can get my own place... Yeah, and maybe stop relying on other sources of income. Look, I just want everything to be fair and square, okay? That's why I called, actually. I needed to talk to you about moving... Richard, we gotta go, okay? We're just getting to school. Okay, fine. But, you know, this isn't gonna solve itself. Look, I'm sorry again, bud. I'll talk to you soon, okay? - Okay. - Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. I am... I'm sorry, Kyle. Three tardies is an automatic detention. I'm doing the best I can here. Okay? Seriously? I can't believe this. Deborah's calling you. Deborah. Hey, I was just gonna call you. I just wanted to make sure I was gonna see you at 9:00. - Absolutely. - Oh, great. I have a big day today. Uh... but I've just hit hellish traffic, so I'm gonna be 15, maybe 20 minutes late, tops. Are you serious? Actually, you know what? It looks like it might be clearing, so... We're good. I can't do this again, Rachel. You know what? I'm gonna call Linda's guy and get in there. I love you, Rachel, but ever since you lost your salon... I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but you're fired. Get your shit together. Deborah, no, wait. I'm sorry, okay? Oh, my God. Are you okay, Mom? Yeah. Just... Oh, my God. Just my... My best client, that's all. I'm sorry. Eight miles, you know. That's it. What takes ten minutes on a Sunday, takes an hour every other day... and wrecks your career. You know why? Too many cars. Too many cars and too many people. Didn't you also oversleep? Yes. Yes. And I overslept. You're absolutely right. It's okay. So... any suggestions? You could take the next exit and do surface streets. You got it. Hold on. I'm gonna get us out of this. From now on, no more freeways, okay? I only trust you, okay? Deal? Deal. It's not getting any greener. Come on, man. Come on! Go! No, no. Go. Oh, come on. Of course. Yeah. - Kyle, don't. - Morning. I don't even get a courtesy tap first? Roll up your window. It's not working. You know what a courtesy tap is, young man? Just ignore him. Sounds like this. It's light. It's friendly. Just like you're trying to get somebody's attention. I'm sure that's what your mom meant. Is that right, ma'am? - Is a courtesy tap what you meant? - No, it's not. Why is that? The light was green, and you weren't moving. Mom. Stop it, please. Some of us have places to be. Yeah, I admit to being a little zoned out back there. I've been kind of having a hard time lately. Yeah, well, join the club. Stop it. Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you are, and I'm sorry that... I might've made it worse. You accept my apology? Sure, whatever. Perfect. If you could just do the same, we could press reset. Ma'am, I was saying, if you could just apologize... Yeah, I heard you. And? I don't have anything to apologize for, sir. - Mom. Just apologize. - It's okay. Well, I don't think that's really true of any of us now, is it? But that's where we are in this world today. We seem to have developed a fundamental inability to apologize to anyone, for anything. I don't even think you really know what a bad day is. But you're gonna find out. You hear me, miss? You're gonna fucking learn. Hey, can you go, please? Just go. Shit. Mom. Oh, my gosh! Stop! Are you okay? Yeah. What's this guy's problem? What's he doing? Just gonna let this person go on his way - and take the back way, okay? - Okay. - Come on, come on, come on. - Is he stopping? Come on. Come on. So that was terrifying. You know, some people are just jerks, and that's all there is to it. Everything's gonna be okay. I got the window up. Hey. So, what was that Fortnite strategy you and Uncle Freddy came up with? You don't care about that. Of course I do. I wanna learn. I wanna learn. You play duos and glide down to a place you're really familiar with, like Retail Row. And then, one of you distracts an enemy while the other speeds a golf cart out from a hiding place and crashes into them. You don't even know what I'm talking about. You're right, I don't, but it sounds awesome. Seriously. So... how long's detention? Thirty minutes. Okay, so, I'll bail you out 3:30 on the nose, and I'll even have a big "make it up to you" Butterfinger Blizzard ready and waiting. I promise. You don't have to promise. Kyle. Can you please try to be on time? Yeah, of course. - Rach? - My nine o'clock fired... ...fired me. Hey, you... you still there? Uh, yeah. What happened? Oh, God. Freeway was a parking lot, and my biggest client couldn't wait, so she told me to go to hell. - That sucks. - Yeah. And then some psycho flipped out on me and Kyle driving to school. - And all this before noon. Shit. - Yeah. At least the day can't get any worse, huh? I could really use some therapy on top of the legal advice. Can you do breakfast instead? Um... at Darrow's? Yes. Pancake therapy, even better. Twenty minutes? Mm. "Human" 20 minutes, or "Rachel" 20 minutes? Ha, ha. See you in 20. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Cash or credit? That'll be, uh, $5.33. Okay. Thank you. Hi. Can I have five Powerball Quick Picks? Thanks. And those. That'll be $13.31. A 20... your tickets... - Here's your change. - Thanks. Okay. Thank you. What can I get you, sir? - Just a pack of Ventti gold. - That'll be all? - That's it. - All right. Cash or credit? Okay. Hi. Uh, ma'am, are you okay? Yeah. Uh... Actually, no. I... I'm pretty sure the guy in that truck's following me. He somebody you know? No, we... we kind of exchanged words at an intersection. I honked my horn at him, and now he's... He's road-raging you. You could say that. - You want me to call the cops? - Nah, that'll take all day. Besides, that'll just piss him off even more. Might. Might not. Look, I can call 'em. I don't know. I'm probably just being paranoid. How 'bout I walk out with you? - You don't have to do that. - I'm heading out there anyway. - So, you think he's... - He's just trying to scare you. If he sees both of us together, and he doesn't drive off, you still get in your car. I make sure I get his plates. If he follows you out, we'll all call the cops. Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it. Why don't you just get in the car? I'm gonna grab his plates. 711 TPX. 711 TPX. Thanks. Hey. Why don't you just chill, man? Go your own way. It's a smart move staying put, bro. I got your plate right here. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Oh... Oh, God. Where's my phone? Shit. Hey. Hey! Come on. Fuck. Oh, God. Oh, shit. Shit, shit. What? That's my fucking phone. Oh, God. What's wrong with you? What are you doing, bitch? I'm sorry. What's wrong with you? "Sorry, sorry." - I'm sorry, okay? - It's a fucking one-way street. Move! - Fuck you, bitch! - Move! - "Sorry." You coming in here... - Sorry, okay? Learn how to drive! - This is not how you drive. - Sorry. Fuck you! Dumb bitch! Oh, God. Hi, it's Rachel. Just leave a message. Hey, Rach. Just calling to see what's up. Please call or text with an ETA. Thanks. Are you Andy? Uh, yeah. I'm Tom Cooper. - I'm an old friend of Rachel's. - Oh, hey. Huh. That makes two of us. Uh, have we met? No, I, uh... I just moved to town a couple weeks ago. Rachel told me she was meeting you here. Yeah. Well, you know what? She's very, very late. Well, she asked me to apologize. But it's hard to tell the level of sincerity in that, isn't it? - Uh, when did you talk to her? - Ten minutes ago. Okay. So, she's okay? Everything's okay? Well, Andy, to tell you the truth... she sounded a little stressed. She's got plenty of reasons to be. Yeah, yeah. The divorce... the salon, her mother. Plus, she said some guy road-raged on her pretty hard this morning. - Really? - Yeah. About a year ago, a guy followed me for about ten miles on my bumper. Scary. They follow me all the time. Yeah? You should be careful. You never know who you could be driving next to, right? Or who you might end up married to. How do you mean? You said she was stressed because of her divorce. No, actually you said that. - Yeah? Oh. - Yeah. She let me listen to his voice mails. You know? I mean... That guy sounds like he's doing his best. Well, the man's quit every job he's ever had. - Is that his biggest crime? - No. Did he fuck around on her? Anything like that? He's just miserable. Kind of like my 11:00 appointment's gonna be if I show up late. Listen, since you're having better luck with Rachel, can you just tell her to call me, please? Now, Counselor... if I could get Rachel on the phone... would you buy me a cup of coffee? And if she doesn't pick up? Well, then I guess I owe you a cup of coffee. Uh... Okay. Oh, God. What? Where is... Oh, God. What? Andy? Are you serious? Rach? Andy? I'm sitting here, and I'm waiting for you. What's... I-I don't... Whose phone is this? I don't understand. How did you... Rach, are you there? Are you at Darrow's right now? Yeah, yeah. I'm sitting here right across from your friend Tom. - Cooper. - Tom Cooper... who apparently has an easier time getting hold of you than your best friend/free lawyer. I don't know a Tom Cooper. Tom Cooper, who just moved to town, who you told to apologize to me for being late. Nice guy. Sweet beard. Hey, listen to me. He's not a friend, okay. He's the psycho who came after me today. Oh, God. I just watched him run over someone at a gas station. Andy, do you hear me? Are you there? No, you're gonna have to say that again, Rachel. You're breaking up. What the hell are you doing? I'm just here with Andy. Hey, if she's almost here, I can wait. Who says if you're almost here, he can wait. What do you want? No, it's not what I want. It's what I need. And I need you to learn what a bad day really is, and I need you to learn how to say you're sorry. Okay, fine. I'm sorry. Okay? There, I said it. No, how to say you're sorry and actually fucking mean it. - Whoa, Tom. - And this is the beginning of that first lesson. - Can I have my phone back? - No. - Leave him alone. - Just give me my phone. Andy? What's happening? What's happening? - You're on speaker now, Rachel. - Call the police! - Andy. - Someone stop him! Andy. - Are you okay? - He is not okay. You hear me? - You hear me? - Yes. I hear you. Who is Andy? Is he really your best friend/scumbag divorce lawyer? - What? - Yeah? The kind of person who fucks over men like me and Richard for a living? Come on. Please. He doesn't do that, okay? He's a decent guy. Is that right? There's a divorce lawyer... who doesn't fuck over decent men for a living? I find that very hard to believe, Rachel! Very hard! What is this? Is this some kind of sick joke? - Are you having sex with him? - What are you talking about? 'Cause these guys, they don't get in trouble for that. They'll fuck you all kinds of ways. Fuck you physically, fuck you emotionally, fuck you financially. And they don't get in trouble for it. Has he been fucking you, Rachel? Has he been fucking you? He's married, okay? That don't mean shit these days. Just leave him alone. Hey, Rachel, if you knew this was gonna be the very last time you could ever talk to your lifelong friend Andy, what would you say? Wait. No, wait. What? What would you say, Rachel? Andy? Hey, what's happening? What's happening? - That was a wasted opportunity. - Wait! Andy? Andy? Andy, are you there? He can't hear you no more. What do you mean? Well, I think you know. No, I don't. I don't, I don't. What did you do? What did you do? Well, why don't you get yourself to a TV. Gonna be a lot of video soon. You put him on the phone. You put him back on this goddamn phone. You put him back on this goddamn phone! No, I can't do that. Why not? Well, number one... he's already dead. No, he's not. No, he's... Hey, listen, listen. I'm really sorry, okay? - I'm really sorry. - You know... I can still hear that faint tinge of "fuck you" in your voice. Never know it, but nothing's ever your good goddamn fault, right? Hello? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Your life is over when they find you. Suicide by cop's okay with me. What do you want? You got some messages. Got one from Dr. Miller. She wants to change your Friday therapy appointment. She better bring her A-game, 'cause you're gonna fucking need it. Got one here from the principal of the Wesley Oaks Elementary School. "Rachel, thank you for your hair and makeup for The Music Man production. Kyle was great in the quartet." Is that your son's name? Is that where he goes to school? No way. Kyle's my friend's son. My son doesn't go to Wesley... Rachel, I'm scrolling through the pictures on your phone. Don't be a fucking idiot. Don't you touch my son! Then tell me, who's gonna die next, Rachel? Who's gonna die? Give me a name, or I'll just play Russian roulette with your contact list. No. I can't. What about Richard? No! No. You telling me there's still some feelings there? He's my son's father. Okay? - You can't ask me to do that. - You know what I can do? I can send the $2300 and change you've got in your checking account straight to Richard. And... every goddamn cent you've got in your savings account. You got me a name yet? Look, here's an idea. How about I swing by your mom's room at the Shady Falls nursing home? Right after I burn your house to the fucking ground. Me. Me, okay? I choose me. I choose me. Well, that's very noble, but you can't choose yourself. Why not? Because that would defeat the fucking purpose, Rachel. Give me a name. Make a choice. Who are you gonna kill next? Your mom? Richard? Kyle? Deb... Deborah. Last name? Haskell. 8277 Walnut Avenue? Now, what was her sin, Rachel? She fired me. Through no fault of yours, I'm sure. I gave you a name. Yeah, you did. So, you won't hurt my son... or my mom, or go to my house? Not right now. I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be sick. Don't lose that phone, Rachel. Yeah. Fuck. Fuck. Okay. 911. What's your emergency? My name is Rachel Flynn. I have multiple emergencies. I need you to listen to me very carefully. Police say the suspect didn't even bat an eye as security cameras and graphic video from terrified customers' cell phones captured him brutally assaulting and then killing the victim in a booth. He can then be seen calmly walking out of Darrow's Diner while talking on a cell phone. Witnesses say he sped away in a gray pickup... Hey, babe. Isn't Darrow's that place with the killer brisket? ...wanted in connection not only with that fatal house fire in Arbor Hills, but a hit-and-run just a short while ago. Babe, you gotta see this. Neighbors say he was badly injured at the auto plant where he worked in middle management - and was fired just shy of his pension. - You okay? He was unable to find steady work over the last year. Please tell me we own whatever that was. He was let go just yesterday from a maintenance company - after being employed there less than a month. - Babe! Once again, the suspect is driving a dark-gray, late-model 4x4 pickup. If you have information, please call the police tip line. That number is 1-800-555... Deborah Haskell? Yes. Is there a problem? Once again, authorities stress that the suspect should be considered dangerous. If you have any information about his whereabouts... ...please call the police tip line. Baby, are you okay? You must be Rachel's brother. Who's this? Mary. - Mary. - Wife? Girl... Girlfriend. Uh, fiancée, fiancée. Uh-huh. Feisty. Please don't hurt her anymore, man. Now, that's gonna be up to you, Fred. That's gonna be up to you and your sister. I-I-I don't understand. Rachel has dismissed me as the unworthiest fuck to ever walk this planet. And you know what, Fred? I don't disagree. Every effort, every sacrifice I've ever made in my invisible life has been dismissed and judged... ignored. I've been chewed up, used up and spat out. So I think "fuck it," Fred. I'll make my contribution this way, through violence and retribution. 'Cause that's all I got left. Look, I have some weed out in the kitchen and ten bucks. I'm not here for your money, Fred. I'm here to make your sister realize that her words and actions have consequences. - Please let my girlfriend go. - Okay, I will. - Please. - I will. See what she did, that sister of yours? Look what she's done now, Fred! All right, guys. Can you get these gates locked up? What the heck? Oh, God. It's a parent. It's all right. Ms. Flynn? This wasn't what we talked about. Yeah, well, fucking surprise. I called the police. Of course you did. Please, just... Just let them go, okay? Are you inside or outside? - Please, just let them go. - Rachel. Stop talking. Are you inside or outside of that school? I'm outside. Go in, get your boy, call me back when you get to the car. And you better be driving as fast and as far away from that school as you can. Don't stop for anybody. You got three minutes, or Fred's dead. Now, Freddy... Freddy, wake up. Come on. You gonna write your sister a letter, okay? Psychologists and other experts say that incidents of road rage are becoming increasingly more deadly. We must be rich, powerful, pretty and celebrated to exist in our culture. Those left behind are doomed to rage like a volcano. Please, just wait right here! Could you stay calm for me, please? Get on the intercom and call him now! - The dispatchers have already been called. - I know. We have procedures, all right? We're on something we call the soft lockdown right now. I'm the reason for that. Okay? Look. Look. That's my little brother, okay? And this maniac's gonna hurt him even worse if you don't go get my son in the next... two minutes. Look, that's him texting me right now. See, look. Look. Same guy. Mrs. Ayers... I need you to go get my son. Goddamn it, I need you to go get my son! Dear Rachel, you are now responsible for Mary's death. Okay? Come on. Write the fucking letter. Careful. Come on. Did you remember my Butterfinger Blizzard? Get in! Seat belt. You're freaking me out. - It's gonna be okay. - Tell me what's happening. - I'm not letting you out of my sight. - What's going on? Mom. Mom, why aren't you talking to me? Have you got Kyle? Yes. Have him say hello. Kyle, say hello. - Is it Dad? - No. Just say hello. Hello? Now put my brother on the phone. Talk. Rachel? Are you okay? Fred? Mary's gone. Mary's dead. Mary... - He made me... - No, no. You didn't. You didn't. - You didn't. - You're right, I didn't. You did. - What? - Mom? Who are you talking to? Please, just... just let him go. Put me on speaker. You have kids? Family? Rachel, your little brother is sitting in a puddle of lighter fluid and his own piss. Put me on fucking speaker. Okay. - Kyle, can you hear me? - Yes. I'm the man your mom honked her horn at this morning. You remember? Yes. Your uncle Freddy, he's written your mom a letter, and he wants to read it out loud. It's very important that she remains quiet and respectful and she listens to every word, okay? Okay. Come on, Fred. Read. Come on. Read. "Dear Rachel, you are now... res... responsible... - for Mary's death." - Responsible for Mary's death! Read the fucking letter, Fred! "I now realize our loving... relationship has been a lie. You are the most entitled, self-centered person that I have ever known. Everything has... has always been about you. I am deeply ashamed of you. You are the reason... this is happening to me and why I will never see another sunrise in my life." Good job. Stop it! Just stop it! Are you talking to me or to Freddy? - You made your point. - Police! Show me your hands and step back. I said put your hands in the fucking air and step back now! - Six-Adam-Three, 10-33... - Don't let him kill me. - ...at 1204 North Jackson. - He has a... He has a... - Get on your knees! - Fuck you. No! Do something! Help him! Help him! Mom? Kyle... I'm sorry. No, don't answer it. Don't answer it. It might be the cop. Hello? Officer? It's still me. Where is my brother? Sorry, Rachel. Freddy's gone. If it's any consolation, a fucking cop shot my shoulder up. I hope you bleed to death. Well, that was sincere. It's just not an apology. There are a lot of people in my life who deserve apologies. You are not one of them. Let's talk about Kyle and how he's gonna die. You so much as breathe in his direction, no force on this earth will stop me from killing you. Do you hear me? Sounds like you're waking up. I am wide awake. Wide awake. That's good, 'cause we ain't near done yet. Yes, this is over. This is so fucking over, you sick fuck! Where should we go? Police station. We should go to the police station. Mom? Yeah? Can I call Dad? Sweetie, I don't have my phone, remember? That man took it. You have your tablet? I think he stole it too. Well, that's probably a good thing. Well, he has your phone, so if we had your tablet, he could know where we are. What? He did know where we were, but... he was using that flip phone. Don't you think? Yeah, maybe. Hey, um... I looked for my tablet before, but... do you just wanna take another look around - just in case? - Yeah. - Check the seat pockets. - Okay. Have a really good look, okay? Look under the seats. - You see it? - I don't think it's in here. Wait, I think I feel something. - I think I see it. - Where? - Under your seat, it's... - What? It's stuck. It... It's what? It was taped. Oh, my God. - Should I throw it out the window? - Yeah. - No. - What? Wait, wait, wait. - "Find Your Phone" app. - Yeah? You put it on the tablet too? Yeah. So, if he still has my phone, we should be able to track him, right? Right. Is it working? I see it. Where is it? Right next to us. Oh, my God. Do you see him? Oh, my God. He's in front of us. - He is? - He has Rosie's van. Mom, look! There's a cop. - Do you see him? - It's okay. It's gonna be okay. He can help us. Put your seat belt back on. - Do not look at him, okay? - Okay. Mom, that... that was... The exit. I know. I know. Kyle, just trust me and get his attention. Officer! Hey! - Officer! Help! - Hello! - Officer! Hey! - Hey! Help! Roll your window down! - Please help us! Hello! Hey! - We need help! The guy you're looking for, he's behind you! Right behind you! Please help us! Pull over! Dispatch, request assist... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Can you see him? He... He's catching up. Go! Go! Kyle, call 911 on the tablet. 911. What's your emergency? The man on the news, he's chasing me in a silver minivan. - Your current location? - Driving on 95 south. Just after the State exit. Ma'am, all units in that vicinity are currently responding to a multi-vehicle crash. He caused that accident! My son and I are in danger! Ma'am, we cannot get to you at the moment. Stay on the line, get someplace safe... Mom, it died! Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Tell me you have the charger. I don't. Oh, my God. We're on our own. Okay. Okay. We should just go to the station. There's no way we can outrun him. We have to lose him. - We need to go to Grandma's. - Why? It's your strategy, remember? - From the video game? - What? It's somewhere we're familiar with, okay? It's the safest place to hide you. And we can call for help with the silent alarm. And it'll confuse the heck out of someone who's never been there before. Right, like Uncle Freddy was saying. He still gets lost there, like a maze of spaghetti. Yeah, exactly. So you think he'll get lost? For long enough. Drive! Go faster! Speed up! He's right behind us. He's catching up. Can you go any faster? Hold on! Fuck! - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Can you see him? - No. I think he's still back towards the entrance. Kyle. Starting now, we stick to our plan. Our backup plan. Yeah, if we do that, I promise you... we're gonna get through this together, okay, you and me. - Yeah. - Okay? Go. Go. Look at me! Look at me! Look at me. You see me? You're always gonna see me. I'm always gonna be inside your head. Every time you think of your little boy... and what you could've done to save him. Kyle? Kyle Flynn? It's the police. You're safe, son. Come on out. Come on, son. Your mom's hurt, but she's okay. She asked us to come and get you. Come on, son. It's okay. Come on out, boy. - I made a lot of noise. - It's okay. No! No! No! No! No! Get off me! Let go! Mom! No! Mom! No! No! Mom! Hey! Here's your fucking courtesy tap! You're okay. You're okay. Mom. We understand that it may have started as a result of a two-car crash... Ms. Flynn? May I have a moment? It's okay. We'll be right back. Okay? I'm so sorry... Uncle Fred's alive. He is? He's gonna be okay. Can we go see him? Yeah. Yeah. We got your statement, so you are free to go. What's your problem? Good choice.
