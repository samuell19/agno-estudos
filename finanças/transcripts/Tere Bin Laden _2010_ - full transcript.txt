Nearly there Hey! Stop! We are here for the press conference We are journalists What channel? Sting TV? Never heard the name. Get lost! We are late! Let us in. You are messing with the press? Get lost! Or should I make you! I'll show you! Check tomorrow's papers. 'Guard's wife elopes with janitor' Let it go Ali. The conference must have started. It's no use now. We'll go and say sorry to Majeed bhai. I'm not giving up this easy. During these turbulent times... we need a perfect democracy where we don't have someone dancing on our head As I was saying, until now Pakistan Hurry, we've to go on air Good morning, you're watching StingTVwith me Maqsood and we've just received news that... that That the Chief Minister has called a press conference in Karachi. We're taking you there now. Switch that off! You deep fried fool! Turn it off! What rubbish! What are you trying to do? Get into his head??! You deep fried fool! From what angle does he look like the Chief Minister? Er... top angle Majeed bhai Why'd you go that far then? You could have shot this instead! Does it look any different? I didn't shoot that! I was holding the ladder. What? Sir it's their fault! Why punish me? I'd like to take this opportunity to clarify... We were off air for two whole minutes! Do you have any idea how much that cost me? Fork out 10,000 if you want to keep your job. Or hitch a camel back to Saudi Arabia! Quick Majeed bhai! Cut it from my pay. Where's he going to get 10,000 from? 20,000 then. 10 for him. 10 for you. Thanking you, yours faithfully... Thank your lucky stars, you nincompoop! I'm giving you one last chance now. There's a cock-crowing competition at Umar Goth tomorrow. Go catch the birds yodeling on camera. And Gul, if you shoot anything other than beaks and feathers I'll make sure you're chasing cocks for the rest of your life. Got it? Now run like your ass is on fire! Impossible! You've been rejected six times in seven years and also been deported once! You might as well make paper planes of your passport. - But Jamaal bhai I've heard that the embassy eats out of your hands. You have to help me. You'll have to start from scratch. A new ID, new passport, a new face. -Anew face? What's wrong with myface? Relax, we won't do plastic surgery on you. Zoya bring me the file of the"late" "Late"? Better late than never! Anyone died who looks like him? Here! The late Mohammad Ismail There! Your job's done! Zoya will make you up to look like him. And I'll get you a passport in his name. Cool. How much do I owe you? 272 grand Holy smokes! What are you saying Jamaal bhai? Can't afford it, can you? Sit down There is a cheaper way. But it might take you 6 months to get to America. No problem! I've waited 7 years. What's another 6 months? Can you fire an AK47? Er, no, why? Look, you're here now in Karachi. We'll first send you to Iran with the Mujahideen. Then to Iraq. The minute you spot an American camp, go surrender, and you're their guest! They'll take you to America for free! So should I put you down as a Mujahideen? Jamaal bhai! That's crazy! It's foolproof, you'll be a traveler so they'll only aim below the knees. Just keep hopping about and you'll be fine. At least you'll get to America even if you do get hit by a bullet or two! Bullet?? Man, you worry too much! The new passport sounds better! Any chance you could do it in 150 grand? Not a chance! I need to grease a dozen palms! Take my advice. This is your best bet. Even if you lose a limb you can get a brand new one in America. They come cheap there. And on easy installments too No! I want a new passport Your call.

Watch this closely Gul Watch what? His cave man nostrils? You blind fool, you're looking at our lottery ticket. You've gone crazy again? Why do I have to spell it out for you every time?

LIVE India presents an exclusive clipping of Osama Bin Laden's latest video message to America from a tape which this channel received from a person who calls himself the KHABRI. This tape proves that Osama is alive and in good health. He says he will make America pay for their atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq. America pay for their atrocities in Afghanistan and Iraq. Welcome sir, I am Usman... Ted jee it is an honour to work with you on the Osama hunt. It also seems that he's had Botox therapy done. He looks ten years younger than before. He's looking us in the eyes and challenging us. And to help us fight this challenge we have with us Officer in Command of American Intelligence- Mr. Ted Wood. If you go to America what will I do here alone, man? Should we try for you, too? We have the money. Well, yeah. Ask and see. We'll stay together right across the White House! That's my boy! What's up, Jamaal bhai? Are you heading to America too? No one's heading anywhere anymore. I'm shutting down. Here's your advance. But I've brought the rest of the money. Fly to America yourself. Lashkar-e-Amreeka is history. Why are you shutting down? Go ask Osama. His video ruined my career. Osama's video? The damn thing's playing on every channel 24 hours a day. He's made my life a living hell. The gates of America have shut forever. They've become very strict. Mohammad, tear the posters down. Give me room. Where you running off to, my champ? What's going on here? See that, kid? Your uncle's on TV! Uncle that's not you... that's Uncle Sam's uncle-Osama Heavy bombing in Afghanistan has caused... ...severe casualties to livestock. America says that this onslaught will continue... ...until Osama is found. You started a war, man. Now how will you get to America? We have to stop this, Gul. As you say, Your Highness. Should I call Bush for you? I'm not joking. What can you do now? Things are out of our hands. The Americans won't stop hammering now. How'd they get here this fast? Get out of myway! What's the matter, Qureishi sir? Son of a bitch! Anything else you need? Any other impersonations? Son of a bitch! You've turned me into a criminal! I won't spare you. I'll expose you on the radio! I'm going to tell everyone what you've done! As if that will stop the war! Oh my God, that's brilliant! If one tape could start a war then another tape can end it! Think about it! Dear George Bush, how long can you use me as an excuse... ...to go oil hunting. Stop your atrocities or else... ...this world will explode like a grenade! It's never too late to put aside... ...our differences and serve humanity! I promise an end to violence! Talk to me Man to Man! And we'll give back to... ...the world what we took from it! Yours truly, Osama Bin Laden. Most sublime! Can we please go back? I'm not even married yet! Shut up. Who wants to marry you anyway! Let's get out of here. Shut up. What are you doing here all alone in the dark? What do you want now? Want? Nothing. It's been so long we thought we'd drop by and say hello. What's this? Wow Noora, you made it to the cover of a magazine! No, people say that's Osama. You'll rot in hell. What have you turned me into? Ljump in fright at the sight of my own face. I'll go straight to the cops tomorrow. I'll go complain to General Musharraf. You put me in a jehadi video? You misunderstood us. -Get out of the way. I know you're the brain behind all this. You destroyed me but you'll have to answer to God. Back off, Noora. Fool. You're sitting on a gold mine and all you do is lay eggs! You can make millions with this face of yours. You'lljust have to do one last thing for us. Now what do you need me to do? The same as last time. No way, don't mess with fate anymore. Suit yourself. Anyone willjump at this chance... ...to make a couple of hundred grand. Zoya can make anyone look like that. See you then. Oh! I dropped my money. Wait a minute, is it dangerous? Not at all. What's he saying? He asked if it's dangerous. No danger at all. There isn't a safer job in the whole world. Promise? -Of course! We'll shoot in the studio tomorrow. Now come on, drop us outside. There's no telling what your roosters might do. Sir, there's nothing in these images. The Americans are bombing the wrong place. We've martyred only donkeys and wild asses so far. You won't get it. That'sTed sir's master plan. What's the plan? Sir, we found the man who sold the tape to LIVE India. How? That night he got three calls from Pakistan from StingTV's Majeed Khan. I still have half the vegetables left to buy. Shabbo, I've important things to do. I know your important things. Some cheap breaking news on your filthy channel. Now where did you go? Is this America? I did fall in a sewer. And that's where you'll stay until we get answers. Answers? Who's the KHABRI? You? Or someone else? No... sir no, I'm not the KHABRI. I'm just a middle man. When did you last speak to Osama? I swear by Allah, I've never spoken to him. I've only seen him on TV. I'm not the KHABRI. I only bought the tape from him and sold it forward. So, if you are not KHABRI... ...then why did he choose to give you the tape? My bad luck. What did he look like? I'm so scared I forget. I think a screw's going loose in my head. Stop! All I remember is that he was... ...in a burqa and he had a pink umbrella. You didn't see his face? I don't stare at women in burqas, sir. Why not? They don't let me! But, yes... ...on his umbrella was the word PAPPU. Write P.A.P.P. U... Pappu! It could also be a double O sir! P.A.P.P.O. O! Watch it, sir. You'll ruin all my umbrellas. Look, Pappu. My name'sTaufeeq. Where's Pappu then? Who's Pappu? The one who owns this shop. I own this shop. Then why call it PAPPU Umbrellas? It sounds good. Sir, perhaps Pappu is a code word. Have you ever seen this man? Of course, he runs that filthy channel 'Sting TV'. What do you know of him? Not much. Two of his reporters came to shoot this shop... ...they stole an umbrella too. Was it a pink one? How do you know? Describe those two. Hello, could I speak to Majeed Khan? What? What? Get inside quickly! Dear George Bush. How long can you use me as an excuse... Dear George Bush. How long can you use me as an excuse to go oil hunting? Stop before the world explodes like a grenade! Did you call Majeed bhai? Sir, I think we found the KHABRI. Sir, your laces. I know! We'll get to Osama soon. I have a feeling... ...there will be some key clues at Sting TV. But who in their right mind would want to kidnap Majeed bhai? No clue. His wife just said he suddenly disappeared two days ago. Who will we sell the tape to, now? We'll figure that later. First let's get this job done... ...and get the hell out of here. What's all the hush-hush about? Is something wrong? Not at all, Noora. Finish your make-up quick. We shoot in five minutes. Where are you going? To pee. Hurry back! Open up the locks. I'lljust go relieve myself. Shoo...! Don't worry, sir. He's a smart and sensitive rooster! He won't hurt you. Smart roosters don't go dancing on stranger's heads. Such dodgy creatures should be left at home. He's not a creature, sir. He's my brother. We run a poultry farm. The best quality eggs in Pakistan. If you ever need any, just call me. I'll let you know. Should I give you my card? No, my hands are busy. I'll take it later. On the right is Majeed's cabin. Left is the edit room. Straight down the hall is the shooting studio. Hm, let's start from the edit room. You missed a spot, Zoya. And here. Gently, now. Gentle enough for you, sweetie pie? Want a sip? This will cool your fire. That map's come loose behind. Could you stick it up please? I think I need a sip. God, I'm burning up inside. No, first, make-up. What are you doing, Noora? My hands feel sticky. What the hell is going on? Final touches. Enough make-up. Let's rehearse now! Noora, pick up the grenade! The other hand! That's good. When I say the word pick up the grenade and look into the camera. Put the grenade down now. Quick. Wait a minute. What the hell is wrong with you? This isn'tfunny! That's not one of your eggs, you know! If that falls we're all dead! Put it down! Can we get a move on? For God's sake, be still! Zoya his forehead's shiny. Please be serious! Stop playing with that! It's real! RUN! Noora, throw it away! No! Sikandar! Nooooo! He was one tasty, er, feisty cock. Noora, go bury him. We'll shoot later. I'm through. I can't shoot anymore. My champ's dead! He's not dead. He's a martyr. How can you let his sacrifice go in vain? Sir, the blast occurred inside the studio. Who could it be? Could it be the police? Could this be a raid? Which key could it be? We don't have time! Break it open! Quick! Get out of here. Zoya, your make-up kit. Latif, take that map down. Gul, get the camera. Qureishi, grab the rest of the stuff! Hurry. Noora? Noora! Stop! You're in the Osama get-up! He'll get us all killed! RUN! Noora, please stop! For God's sake, stop! Please leave me alone! I don't want to do this anymore. You guys stay on Noora's tail. We'll take a shortcut and cut him off. Hello, sir. We're from a TV channel. Can we interview you? You're on duty this late at night? - Yes The nation should be proud of you. How many kids do you have? - Three. Three kids despite night duty? Wow. Which song would you like to dedicate to them? Move. - Er, what song is that? Excuse me? What a horror! Sir? Why have you stopped us? Who're you? I'm his# she #and he's my #he# Why doesn't he speak? The words refuse to step out his mouth. He's mute. They'll come out if those Holy Gates let them. What a buffet of teeth! You can go. Sir, we've tracked Ali's mobile phone. Whats the location? South west of Malir... Guddu, duty calls! Noora, why are you removing your jacket? Let me go. It'll only take a few minutes. Latif, check the light on his face. Gul, hurry, we don't have time. Noora, you remember the speech? I don't even remember my own name. Zoya ma'am, please tell them I can't do this. Zoya, check his make-up. Gul, hurry. Dear George Bush. How long can you use me as an excuse to go oil hunting? Stop before the world explodes... Man, why are you crying? Get in character. Punch it! Come on! Action! Dear George Bush, how long can you use me as an excuse to... ...damn your mother... damn your dad damn your plans. Go to hell! Noora, wait! Two minutes is all I need! The future of the world is on the line! It's my neck on the line! This is going to blow up in my face! I promise you. Nothing is going to blow up! Where did you find him? He was lying unconscious near the blast. Looks like the impact got him. Should we interrogate him? No. Sir, could we take a picture each with Osama? You nuts? This case is America's... ...letTed sir handle it. Where are Ali and his gang? Ali Hassan a.k. A the KHABRI. Sign this. It's your confession that you... ...and your team gave Osama shelter... ...and were helping him escape. Helping him escape? Yes, but you failed. Osama is in our custody now. Alive. Osama...? What the hell are you saying, you son of a bitch? What did you get by ruining me? Blew all my roosters to pieces! BURN IN HELL! My pet Bushie, you've liked your meat deep-fried and oily... ...ever since you were little. You used to dream of having oil fountains in... ...your backyard. Then you came, shook hands with me. What a... ...magic move, buddy. Your sly ways took you straight to the oil wells... ...and now you bathe in Iraqi petrol and Afghani diesel every day.
