[dreamy piano and strings music playing] [Ólafur] I wanted to start by talking a bit about this project. We have now travelled the country this past seven weeks and gone to seven places, recorded seven songs with seven artists I have worked with very closely to create these songs. And this is, in reality, a way to create an album in a modern setting, but in actuality we are making a film. Cooperation is unbelievably important in music, and I work very much with that in mind If it’s film makers, or designers or light crew, or sound men or other musical people, you learn from them and get new ideas and challenges from them, and I think that is exactly what has happened here. [unintelligible chatter] Hi, hi. [in English] This is Einar Georg. He's going to be doing poetry today. [laughs] I am trying to answer some questions here. So, most of the locations are insides... because we are actually travelling with a professional recording studio... And... uhm... we didn't want to record outside because of wind and stuff like that... because this is, in the end... The music that we're recording here is going on an album, which will be released on vinyl and everything. So... we wanted audio quality first and not just recording beautiful locations. So, don't... You shouldn't be expecting us to be playing on... glaciers or in volcanoes or some crap like that. [laughs] And we'll be playing in nice living rooms and, uhm... A big part of the project will be just visiting people's houses and seeing the real... kind of... I think what I like to call the real culture of Iceland, not the tourist boy culture of Iceland. [soft pizzicato music playing and stream flowing] ...to go to the bathroom Morning Good morning, are we being photographed? Oh my. My name is Einar Georg Einarsson and I’m born in Húsavík and the day before yesterday was my 75th birthday. Happy birthday and I think it’s an absolutely terrible thought, but this happens to everybody that become this old. And I’m born and raised in Húsavík, and the poem in the book is about... the boy who sits south of a tar painted wall in a bed of buttercups. This is because I was very often alone. A bullied boy, I was very often alone and I thought it was so nice to lay like that and daydream, there just south of this barn wall. [Ólafur] In Húsavík then? -In Húsavík. And there was tar paper there and I can still smell it. When the sun shines on the tar paper there’s a special smell. It smelled good and it was a good place to be. There I started kneading together rhymes there all by myself and all that. [Ólafur] How old are you then? Young? Yes, I would have been like... 12 years old or something [stream sounds over the music] [birds chirping] [Ólafur] Do you have three kids then? [Einar] No, I have six kids all told, four with the first wife and two with the second. [Ólafur] I know Steini and Ásgeir of course. Yes, they’re half-brothers. [Ólafur] I played in a band with Steini once, just for a bit. Good childhood friend of mine is Þórir Georg from Húsavík. [Einar] Þórir Georg is my daughter’s son. No! He is my grandson, Þórir’s mother is my daughter, my oldest daughter. [Ólafur] Okay, I didn’t know that. No, and Þórir is also called Georg from me. [Ólafur] Yes, it’s all connected now. [Einar] Ásgeir went into all of this so quickly, he was never going into this, but started letting someone hear some songs he had written as a kid, and then it was just okay immediately publishing and suddenly there’s this CD. This CD there that is a double platinum record on the wall? Yes, a double platinum record [Ólafur] And why is it hanging on your wall? It is me that owns this. That is because of the lyrics, I’m told. [Ólafur laughs] You’re told? And did you write all the lyrics on this record? Yes, but he has the rest I think? I know Júlli who is with him in the band has one or two. [doorbell chimes] [Ólafur] Are there guests? Huh? [Ólafur] Are guests coming? Yes, it’s this one. [laughs] I thought it was a doorbell. And it’s just an electrical sound from this? Yes, this is a fake gimmick, the kids gave it to me at some point in... How often does it chime? Six times? It starts playing this intro and then it chimes. [Ólafur] Does it also do this at night? [Einar] Yes, I think so. I think so. [Ólafur laughs] [chattering] [accordion plays single note] Look, see. This will be so that Einar will start reading and you have presumably sat down, haven’t you Baldvin? They don’t need to... And when he has just started reading I will walk into frame and start playing this intro. The strings are just on B, aren’t they? The poem you chose, I had never thought about it like this before. I thought about it when you had chosen it, then I thought it was damn good. [Ólafur] Yes, it is damn good. When I had finished, yes, you see, it is very dear to me. This river was especially very dear to me. This river is especially dear to me, this is Laxá in Aðaldalur, which is just above the power plant of Laxárvirkjun. But it runs on a lava field all the way from Mývatn and to the sea. Like it says in the poem that the sound is from an ancient flame. "The river in the lava. In a blue dream, she enjoys alone cheerfully plays on currents and falls" [soft arpeggiated piano playing] "and jokingly splashes on a gray shore in a pit with ease slowly moves with careful grace the river thunders constantly reborn and wondrous She performs the most beautiful art, From an ancient flame a rumble made I hear the distant sound, in my heart I hear the distant sound, in my heart". [strings join gracefully] [first violin leads passionately] [music gradually intensifies] [music gradually becomes softer] [strings fade] [music fades] [Einar] Yes, I was just going to say that, see. Even though my memory is getting a bit spotty this is one of the things I always remember [Ólafur] You always remember the poems Yes. I am very much like that, remember phone numbers and such badly. [Ólafur] It's the same with the music, see, people that are in music. Although the memory would fade and other things as well... people always remember the songs and melodies [melancholic piano playing] [gentle rain] [unintelligible] [car door closes] [Dagný] I think that maybe when you move to Flateyri -and to the West in general, [music fades, flies buzz] You just do what you‘re good at. Naturally, I‘m a piano teacher so I immediately started working in the music school of Ísafjörður, and also at Flateyri. Then I was asked to handle the church choir and the organist job here at Flateyri. [rain resumes] [Dagný] That is probably the best decision I ever made because you get to know the people so well. And here we rehearse, in this building, we rehearse downstairs and sing together, and then Helga Dóra brews my coffee here in the living room and it’s just... These are such good times and I’m so glad to have gotten the chance to get to know the people here this way. Music is just such a big part of this area and has in a way always been. There is a really big choir culture and such care put to musical learning and teaching. I think that almost everybody has tried being in the music school of Ísafjörður at some point so you feel that there is a really strong tradition for performing music and music in general. So I couldn’t be in a better place. The kids feel good here, they sort of just raise themselves like we say here. This is such a good community. And as I get to know the people better and the place, the roots just grow stronger. [Dagný] Yes, we went to Ísafjörður the other day and there were kids there on the playground. Einar started talking about how many kids there were on the playground and I think there might have been three or so kids there. So I thought, “Yes, this is the boy from Flateyri”. There’s just a crowd on the playground! But they have lots of fun going into town and it’s very special for me to go to Reykjavík for example now and experience Reykjavík through them. Because they think everything is so amazing for example going on an escalator. Somehow that was a huge moment for María. [Ólafur laughs] -And all of these things that I think are very fun to experience through them. [string instrument tunes] -Should we try? -Yes. -One before D? -One before D. [organ playing] [violin joins] [Ólafur] I was remembering earlier that you played for my first album. -[Ólafur laughs] [Dagný] Yes, yes, I remember that well. [Ólafur] Because I couldn’t play that song myself, you were the best piano player. [Ólafur] Yes, was it like that? [organ rehearses alone] [Dagný] Because he ends like this. [Ólafur] Yes. [Dagný] But there’s a still a big difference between the winter and the summer here, there’s a huge difference. Yes, I think I came here in the summer exactly, I came here I was in Bolungavík sometimes when I was a child. Yes, exactly. [Ólafur] Two winters, because Mom and Dad were somewhere abroad. Visiting? Exactly. I was here the winters of ’95 and ’96 I think at Bolungavík. Then the snow was here, I remember that we had to dig ourselves out of the house -and up in order to get out. -Yes, exactly. My first winter here wasn’t like that and I thought, “Yes, these are some exaggerations with the people”. But then there have been winters like that, we’re just like here by a hillock and then... sometimes you’re just locked in. [rain pouring, birds chirping] A MEMORIAL FOR THOSE WHO WERE LOST IN THE AVALANCHE OF FLATEYRI. OCTOBER 26TH, 1995. [Dagný] See when Kristján Torfi was a kid, my husband. Then there were 70-something kids in the school -Yes, wow. -And now there are... -it hasn’t been that long I think [Ólafur] Yes there are fewer. Yes and the Avalanche changed things and many who moved away because of it. And many things changed because of that shock. I think that those who are left have decided that they want to stay. I don’t think they feel forced to stay. They can value what this place has to offer. And I know that these people who moved away also come here very regularly and they care about this place. There is a very strong root. I feel it with Diddi and his friends, these kids who grew up together that there’s a special friendship there. Completely amazing to watch that, somehow such strong roots. Just to get to grow up together and maybe also to experience this shock they’ve had to endure. [arpeggiated organ playing] [strings alternate with gentle determination] [keyboard reverberates in the background] [music fades gradually] [organ plays alone] [music ends and fades into nature sounds] [Ólafur] The race to the quality of life seems to be much less important than you see in the bigger cities Yes. Yes I think maybe there is more contentment with what you have here. Someone said at some point, I think it was in Súðavík, I can’t remember who said it, someone from Súðavík. “If you can’t get it in the store here, you don’t need it” [both laugh] You can’t get everything in the store, but I learned you don’t need anything else. [melancholic piano playing] [birds chirping] [Hilmar] Strandakirkja, this is the holy place in south Iceland. And It’s the Chamber choir of south Iceland that Is working with you here, this amazing choir piece. I came here, in ’83, at that time I’m recently graduated from the musical school, and then this is my first job where I am the organist from Þorlákshöfn, and Strandakirkja was a part of that package. So I thought somehow ideal that we’d be in Strandakirkja. [Hilmar] And of course Georg, he is recently born then and knows the acoustics and such. [choir sings faintly] [Hilmar] Spent time with his dad. And then I’ve just quit Þeysarar, see. [Ólafur] So you’re from the punk rock, like I am [Hilmar] Yes, we’re just old punk rockers. Then it was just fun to come here to a completely different atmosphere. Always good to meet good punkers by chance. Yeah. This is always happening, you work with some people in the classics, there’s always someone who used to... Yes and then you just comb the hair to the side. You had a mohawk? Really? Yes of course Not completely like the older dudes. This of course meant other clothes, I’m more colorful today. There was only one color that was right, and that was black. [choir sings] [Hilmar, stomping to the beat] One, and two and... The wind calms... Two, three, one two, three and sixteen. We moved to Germany when I was three, but I was then put into a boys' choir, was put into auditions. I remember I sang “Foli, foli fótalitur” Yes. One of the lively Icelandic rhymes And Dad played under. And I was accepted into the boys' choir of Hamburg. I sang with them until I was ten, and enjoyed it very much. [choir sings] There, Beautiful! [Ólafur hums] This is awesome! This was perfect, there Yes the strings are just... But this holy place, we are with Mary here, she is supposed to have appeared to sailors in dangerous weather. And the story says this was maybe 11th or 12th century. And they have the ship full of good timber, but they fall into quite the storm and they all fall down on their knees to pray, thinking their life is over unless they get a light from the shore. And then an angel appears some say, some say it was the Holy Mary, I like it more with the Holy Mary. And that’s exactly when she looks down into the angel bay. And that’s the only place where you can safely go to shore, they just slid easily to shore. And of course they kept their promise here and built a church. [birds chirping] [Hilmar] We feel it of course, we feel the peace, how good it is to stay here. That’s why I think the song is so beautiful, it’s just written into this atmosphere. And I have to praise you also for the lyrics. Best to not be saying too much No, I’ve always thought that’s best That has always been misunderstood Words are unnecessary Yes completely, in this you just have to, oooh and aaah is enough. [choir joins gradually, with force] [organ counterpoints] [strings replace the choir] [music fades] [calm nature sounds playing softly] [nature fades] [ambient keyboard echoes] [indistinct chattering] [Atli] I went abroad to the US when I was 22-23 something like that, and I somehow wanted to, I just got the same instinct as when I came back. I just had to leave. And it’s so funny, growing up here in Akureyri, the only thing I thought about the last five years here was how to get away. And then you end up coming back home So I went to the Berkeley college of music in Boston, And by coincidence I happened upon a movie music course. I tried it, and fell in love Feel the power of Jesus, this is kind of a connection in this. Are there any people standing? We can make that happen. Yes. It would be very cool to have some standing and some sitting. Yeah, great. [Atli] See, what I was thinking, when the violin first comes in, that it should be... [turning of pages] [plays notes on piano] Is it supposed to be “bah, bah” [hums] [piano and humming] [Atli] Tell me something, what did you first think when I told you I was moving to Akureyri? [Ólafur] You know, “Is he getting sick? some kind of crazy?” [Atli] You know, it’s become a year since I moved here but I counted it together recently and I spend more time -in LA than I do here. [Ólafur, laughing] Yeah okay! Even though I’ve moved here, but I think it’s, you know I could explain it logically, but I think it’s some sort of intuition, or need. Of course the kids want me to be here, there’s freedom with the family and such. [Atli] The thing is, I think it’s some kind of misunderstanding with people that I’ve retired here. Actually, like I said it’s just my way of redefine myself and the future anew Kind of a new chapter. Some people would call it "a mid-life crisis". I like to say that I’m going through some sort of "a quarter-life crisis". -Yes does that exist? -Quarter-life crisis. If we say I’m going to get 120 years old then it could make sense. [laughs] [faint violin rehearsing] [Atli] You know, I’ve made movies myself like Vantage Point, was a big movie in the US. Hansel and Gretel... ...Witchhunters. Yes, and this kind of movies that do good things and you meet fun people. But now I think it’s very fun to be stuck with Icelandic movies and European ones. To try something completely new. It’s almost like it’s complete opposites, there’s almost too little direction, you’re just told to do this and we’ll see you later. That sounds familiar with these guys. I just say “score” and he says “nice” [Ólafur] You can hear the North Iceland Symphony Orchestra in some of these Hollywood movies, recorded here in Hof in little Akureyri. [Atli] Totally, there was a film I made last year, The Perfect Guy, was the most popular film in the US in September of last year. And that was just the music from the North Iceland Symphony Orchestra, recorded here in Hof, and I think the people here somehow don’t realize it. They’re just: “Yes, I read the words on the page” but I think people don’t really understand it’s really happening. Millions of people go to the cinema listening to music that was recorded here in Hof. Which do you want to record first? -The strings? -Play first. Play first, stretch later. [laughs] The feeling I get is that as an artist I need to be here, just to write. At least in between. Shut off all the noise and the random stimulus that follow living in a big city Yes. You know, I, at least, work that way. I need to get silence. Yes, me too Just walk into the hills above the town and I get some sort of inspiration. [ambient keyboard echoes] [violins join] [woodwinds and stings tie in] [woodwinds counterpoint] [music intensifies] [music's strength diminishes] [keyboard only] [wind swishes] [horn blows in the distance] [horn is cut sharply, replaced by whistling] I heard you got a horse and everything I can get a horse, goat, rooster, calf, left-wing politician... [forceful laughter] [brief whistling] No, I wasn’t going to do that.. [Ólafur] So, how is it to be retired? [Þorkell] A lot to look forward to, I still have my summer holiday [Ólafur] You have a summer holiday from your retirement? [Þorkell] Until my retirement. I still have some holidays so I finish that just before retiring this fall. [Ólafur] How is it, are you growing Basil? Yes, I enjoy that Making a jam, or pesto? Pesto, yes. I make some pesto and cook with it. Then I sell the pesto in the market. We sold, on Saturday we sold 40 jars and made 9,000 ISK. [both laugh] Profit, big profit. You don’t take this to the tax man [Ólafur laughs] [Ólafur] How is it being the only man in this home? [Þorkell] You get terribly... can’t you see how gray I’m getting? And prone to drinking? Naah this is okay, see, there are two gone but one left. -Yes. -No, we have always had so much fun. [Þorkell] The only thing is that a week ago we got a rooster. He’s been keeping me up a lot. He starts crowing at 2 AM. So he could be interrupting the recording. That’s all fine, that’s just fun. [both laugh] Nice to get a rooster with us, just feels like home. And whose rooster is this? I don’t... I have advertised in a Facebook group for the area. It’s probably... [rooster crows in the distance] Look, there he goes! Yes, it’s out there. Maybe we should open a window And nobody wants to recognize it? No, there’s a husband and wife that are abroad somewhere that probably own him [rooster crows] Yes, there he goes. [both laugh] There he is. [piano and horns playing softly] [Þorkell] Of course it’s been a whole lot of trouble but I enjoyed it very much. [Ólafur] Yes, didn’t you? [Þorkell] I got a bit nervous for this, especially the interview, I’m impossible for this [Ólafur] You’re not the worst one [Þorkell] No there are probably worse ones. It’s very interesting to me, lots of gear and moving things around. Have you been an actor before? I have acted in films before, what’s it called...? -Bróðir minn ljónshjarta. In Þingvellir. -No! I played... This is my favorite film in the whole world! We were gotten to play some jerks and we were killed. Over in Almannagjá Yes, yes! It was a band I was in, called Gaddavír, and we went ahead to Hótel Valhöll, so we went to the bar to warm up a bit. Then we were killed there and there’s always so much wait for these things. So we lay there dead and afterwards, when we were supposed to stand up, there was one of us who just kept laying there. Turns out he fell asleep there. You’re ruining my childhood. [arpeggiated piano plays over the rain] [horns join] [music fades] [birds crow] [tractor motor running] [soft piano playing] [sea and pelican sounds] [Ólafur] You published an album, what? Last year? [Nanna] Yes, uhm yes. [Ólafur] How many gigs were in that tour? You just finished a tour right? [Nanna] We just finished a tour, wait, this was put together. Fuck I can’t remember. This was 100 ... it was around 150 shows I think. [Ólafur] In all continents [Nanna] Yes, all continents, we did that. [Ólafur] You actually did all continents, right? You went to Africa? [Nanna] Yes, we went to Africa. [Ólafur] Islandia, France. Awesome. [Nanna] Yeah. [Ólafur] 6 - 0. wasn’t it something like that? [Nanna] 6 - 0? [Ólafur] Soccer, you know, EM? ..or something [Nanna] Yeah, right .. Hooh! [Ólafur] Hooh! [Ólafur] I hate it. We were playing in London the other day, at a festival... [voices fade into string music] [Nanna] They can’t be too big though, can they? [Ólafur] See this one? If I mess this up, then... [Ólafur grunts and laughs] [Nanna] Awesome. [Ólafur] Whoa, this was five or something! [Nanna] I realize it always when I come back to Mom, how nice this actually is. As a teenager is was very much like.. “Noo..” I would have loved going somewhere else, but then I realize why people come here later and just want to be here easy going. It was really nice growing up here, amazing. [Ólafur] I’ll believe that. [Nanna] Very calm. Just to be playing outside and you know, in nature. One of my first concert with them, was to warm up for Hjaltalín. We have a member of Hjaltalín with us today, -in the strings section. Viktor, -Oh, right! -I think so. -I don’t think he knows about this. [Ólafur] That you warmed up for him? No, I don’t think he does. I think I’ll have to... I wonder if he remembers this concert. It was the first time they performed “Þú komst við hjartað í mér”. -They premiered it then. [Ólafur] Is that right? [Ólafur] So one of your first gigs was warming up for the violin player -of our song today. [Nanna] Yeah. [Ólafur] Should we have a little look inside? [Nanna] Yeah, I’m very curious [Ólafur] Check it out, hear the reverb [Nanna] Yeah. [loud clap echoes lastingly] -Yes. -And you should turn this way -the whole time. -Okay. -We’re constantly moving past here. -Yes. We’ll just have this comfortable for you, this is a little cramped here, but we’ll make it more comfortable for you. -Can I sit here? -You can sit here, totally. -Will that be weird? -No, that’s just amazing. The lighthouse guard was just telling me how many people run ashore here. -Yes. -It’s just a reef way out there. So it’s nice. -So uplifting. -Yes, it’s a very uplifting place. Crashed ships, mannequins, dead flies. [loud buzzing] Dead flies... -[Ólafur] It’s caught fire! -[Nanna] Whoa! Did you see that? It literally caught fire! It was just ablaze! This is such a hardcore place. [both laugh] I’ve never been to this lighthouse though, never inside you see. Often been inside that one. Why, or you know, what were you doing in there? It’s just, one of the few things to do in Garður. But are you allowed to go in there normally? Is it just open and you can have a look inside? Yes, or at least it used to be like that. So as a teenager you would be like, popping by the lighthouse? Popping by the lighthouse... And Dúddi’s store.. Dúddi’s store...

I think the most interesting point for us in all of this is that in the end, the film isn’t about what we originally were going to make a film about. [Ólafur] and in the beginning, we really didn’t know at all what It was going to be about. I think it’s like this more often than people like to admit, nobody really knows what he’s doing until afterwards. [Ólafur] The surroundings create an atmosphere for ideas to grow and develop. [Ólafur] My biggest influence is the people I work with. Whether it’s film makers, music people, poets... They teach me new things and they challenge me. During this journey, I met a lot of these people, who all shaped the project their own way. [inaudible clapping] [Ólafur] The tone of the violin player, the voice of the poet, the movements of the conductor, the lights, the shadows, the rain that pounds the church window... All of this affects our thoughts and therefore out ideas. The most interesting cooperation of all is, what I call, the fact that no work of art is ready until it has reached the ears of its listener or affected someone. [music fades] So the most important coworker is in fact, the listener. It’s only there that the work of art is created, how we interpret what we hear. How we decide that there’s music there. That’s why I wanted to involve all of you tonight, this is the only video where we have an audience. and I wanted to do more than just have you here, I was thinking if you would be up for singing a bit with me. [Ólafur laughs] Okay..? [Ólafur] Just these two notes. [Player] Both at once? [Ólafur] No just: "daaaaahhh". [player] Okay, nice. Okay? Did you get that? We’ll just do this once and then together [people follows Ólafur singing] And then immediately again. [people singing, which fades into a distant choir] [Ólafur laughs] [clapperboard clicks upbeat dreamy piano plays] [violins join] [piano playing forceful chords] [strings come together energetically] [strings recede] [piano fades] [distant nature sounds] [nature sounds fade]
