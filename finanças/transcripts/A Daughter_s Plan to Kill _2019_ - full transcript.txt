- Hi, handsome. - Good morning, gorgeous. Morning. - There they are. - Morning, Dad. - Hi. - Morning. - Good morning, Dad. - Morning, sweetie. - Thank you. - Good morning, Dad. - Good morning, son. - Bye, guys, love ya. - Bye. - Bye, have a good day. - Oh, don't forget to come home right after school today. We know, you told us, like, a million times. - Did I? - Yeah. - Okay, come home right after school. - Later. - You nervous? - I just can't believe this is actually happening. It's all so sudden. - I know, but it was the right thing to do. - I haven't seen Samantha in years. Jeez, it's been decades. She was only a year old when I left. - Hey, none of this is your fault. - I know, I just feel like I could've tried harder. - Samantha's mother cut you out of her life. You did the best you could under the circumstances, and now you're making it right. - Yeah. - You still nervous? - Of course. What if she doesn't like me? - Who wouldn't love you? - Cats, cats do not love me. Maybe small birds, and that guy that works at the liquor store, he-- - Greg, you're gonna be fine. Look, this is your second chance, you deserve to know Samantha. You can do this. We can totally do this. - How'd I get so lucky? - Oh. - Oh, hey, what do you think Samantha might want for dinner? - Well, she told me she's a vegetarian, so, lettuce? I can work with that. - You have any clients today? - No, I took the whole day off to prepare. - Well, I only have two consults, so... - No surgeries? I don't believe it. - Believe it, baby. I might actually be home early for once. - That'll be the day. - Love you. - Love you too. - Samantha, it's so good to see you. Hey, Dad. - Uh, hi, I'm Katie. Uh, these are your half-siblings, this is Lauren and Tommy. - Hey. - It's so nice to meet you, Samantha. Oh, come in, come in, please. - Uh, I-- Tommy, will you help her with her bags? - Yeah, of course. Ah, so are you hungry? Greg said you're a vegetarian? - Yeah, I'm definitely hungry. All right, how was your trip? - Uh, it was okay, it was uneventful. Oh. - So how did you guys meet? - Um... - Uh, well, I was working-- - That's going way back. - Yeah, I was working at this coffee shop, near campus, and Greg would come in every Wednesday morning, that was my shift. One day, he finally asked me out, and he was so excited that I had said yes on the first ask, that he's walking away from me all cool and maintaining eye contact, and he fell and tripped and got stuck in the bush and I had to help him out. I've never laughed so hard in my life, his arms and legs flailing all over the place, it was so good. - Okay, they weren't flailing, that's a bit of an exaggeration. - Well, how long have you guys been married? - Uh, it'll be 19 years next month. - Wow, 19 years. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I guess it didn't take you long to start a new family after Mom kicked you out? - Listen, Sam, I wanted to be a part of your life, I always wanted that, but your Mother, she just refused. - Don't worry, Dad, I get how she was. Um, I'm kinda tired. - You must be. Uh, Lauren, Tommy, do you guys wanna help Sam get settled and show her to her room? - Uh, we can give you a quick tour if you'd like, show you around in case you need anything. - Okay, sure. - Right this way. - Oh, I'll help you with these. - And this is your room. Bathroom's right there, I'm next door, and Tommy's just upstairs if you need us. - Cool, thanks so much for helping me with my bags, and it's so nice to meet you guys. - You too. I'm really sorry about your mom, but I'm really glad that you're here. - Thanks. - So, uh, do you go by Sam or Samantha? Yeah, Sam's fine. - Cool. Well, goodnight, Sam. - Goodnight. - Night, sweet dreams. - You too. - Oh, come in. - You need anything? - Uh, no, I'm good, I think I'm just gonna unpack a bit before bed. - Um... I'm, I'm really happy that this all worked out. - Yeah, me too. - Oh, also, only if you're feeling up to it, tomorrow night, my boss is throwing this little get-together for my work anniversary. He lives right next door, it's just nothing fancy, some family friends and colleagues. - Yeah, um, it sounds great. - Great. Great, all right, well, goodnight, Samantha. Hey, Dad, um, thanks so much for having me, I really missed you. - Sweet dreams. Night. - You know, I think that went really well. - Yeah. She seems sweet. God, what happened to her mom was so tragic. You know, I could try to talk to her, get her to open up. - Oh, don't do that. Not yet, I really want her to feel comfortable here. - Yeah, I want that too, I just know that healing requires letting it out, and she also seemed pretty uncomfortable when we were talking about our relationship. - She didn't mean it. I mean, it's a lot for anybody to take in. - You're right, no, you're right, I'm sure it's just my therapist brain working overtime. - Let's not psychoanalyze her before getting to know her, deal? - Deal. How are you feeling with all of this? - I see, psychoanalyzing me now, Doctor. - Shut up. - Uh, I'm excited, I'm scared, and I don't know what I'm doing. - You don't have to, we're gonna do it together. - Get in here. - Thank you for coming today, it's an honor. Excuse me for a moment. - That's, that does help. It does help. Hi, oh, hello. - Plastic surgery? - Not easy, I know. - Greg, hi. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Good, tough to follow in my footsteps, Dad, I'd love to be a plastic surgeon. - I'd, uh, like to propose a toast. Dr. Greg Carlisle is the epitome of everything that Saint Joseph's Hospital strives to be. Kind, family-oriented, and committed to providing our community with the best possible care. He is the definition of grounded, has raised two beautiful children, Tommy and Lauren, and, uh, married a woman who I must say is, um, way out of his league. Am I right? Yes, sure. - Ladies and gentlemen, Greg Carlisle and his beautiful family. Yeah, come on, don't be shy. - Well, thank you, Richard. - You're welcome. - It's an honor to be a part of the Saint Joseph's team, and I'm very grateful for the incredible support staff, and I'm so happy that so many of you were able to be here tonight. My work is as important to me as being a father and a husband, and as my beautiful wife says, being Superman only takes the will to try, so... So thank you for allowing me the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of this community. Woo! Here-here! - Samantha? Samantha? Samantha? Samantha, wait. He didn't mean it. - He didn't even mention me. - He didn't know. Now, look, this is a new situation for all of us, okay? We just need a chance to acclimate. - It is all about your perfect-family image, I just don't fit in. - Of course you do, this is your family now. - No, it's not. - Samantha-- - Don't. - Hey. - Hey. So, does everyone hate me now? - What? No, no one hates you. Yeah, right. - You know, I was just thinking about my favorite memory of you. I came to visit, and we all went out for Italian food, and I bought you this big, pink, stuffed bear. It was bigger than you. I remember that bear. - Yeah, and you were wearing these overalls with these little balloons on the front. We tried to keep them clean, but you kept getting spaghetti all over them. And I sat next to you, and you fed me pasta with your grubby little hands. - You mean I wasn't even using a napkin and a fork yet? - Nope, you took after your dad right from the start. - I wish it had just been you and me. - Well, now it can be. Just give it a little time, okay? Katie's great, and the kids. You'll see once you get to know them. And if you feel up to it, you can go with them to Tommy's soccer game tomorrow, it'll be fun. - All right, I'll go. - Great, I'll tell Katie. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah? - I'll always be your favorite, right? - You're my girl. - Uh, oh. Uh, you scared me. I thought you were still sleeping. - No, I, I was just looking for something. - Anything in particular? - Yeah, do you have tape? - Yeah, uh, it's right here actually. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. - Much better. - All right, come on, Tommy! - Let's go, let's go. - Let's go! Come on, Tommy! - I'm gonna apply to 12 schools, three Ivy League. I'd love to go to Brown, that's where you go, right? - Yeah, I'm taking the semester off. - Oh, what's your major? - Psyche. Mom wanted me to major in business, but... - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! - Nice one! - Woo! - Woo! - Hey, Lauren. - Hey, Milo. - Oh, Milo. So, what's the story? - What story? - Listen, Miss Innocent, I can tell you like him. - It's nothing. He's a senior anyway, so-- - So? I mean, I've never really, like, been with a guy or anything, so-- - Like, not even kissed? I mean, come on. - Nope, not even kissed. - Well, we will fix that. - So, uh, she cool? - She seems nice, I haven't really hung out with her yet. - Hey, it sucks what happened to her, man. Hey, she talk about it yet? - Nah, man, I think she wants to forget all that. - Oh. - She's hot. - Samantha looks like she's getting along well with everyone. How's that transition going? - Yeah, yeah, you know, I mean, it's only been a couple of days, but the way she's getting along with the kids, I mean, so far, so good. - Good. - Seems promising. - Good. - I'm gonna be right back, guys. - This guy. - So, can I sit down with you guys? - Yeah. - So you gonna introduce me to your friend? - Oh, uh, this is-- - I'm Samantha. I'm Lauren's sister. Well, technically, I'm only her half-sister, but we are working on being one big, happy family, right, sis? Yeah, totally. - Cool. So what are you, like, a junior? - Yeah, in college. You look like you could be a college boy yourself. - Oh, yeah? Thanks. I was thinking Notre Dame, Coach Academy. Oh, you mean Notre Dame. - Notre Dame. - My dad said not to ask any questions, all right? Her mom was in the house when it burned down. More like exploded. Like, I looked it up, man. Look, there was nothing left by the time the fire department got there. - All right, well, I'm sure the last thing she wants is everyone feeling bad for her, so just be cool with her, don't ask any questions. - I'm gonna get something to drink, can I get you something? - Sure. - Cool. I'll be right back. - What is up with you? - Nothing. - Come on, tell me. - You were flirting with him. - With who? Milo. - What, that? No, oh, my gosh, don't be jealous, I was doing that for you. It's all a part of my Lauren and Milo plan, I promise, trust me. Yes. Who's that? - Ryan? He's Tommy's soccer coach. Him and my mom have known each other since, like, forever. - And Dad's cool with it? - I mean, yeah. I guess, I don't know, why? - No reason, I'm just gonna go over and introduce myself. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Where's she going? - Oh, she's just gonna introduce herself to Ryan. Hey, Katie. - Oh, hey, Samantha. You having a good time? - Yeah, totally. Um, wait, I'm Samantha. - Oh, this is, um... Sorry. - Ryan, it's nice to finally meet you. - So how do you guys know each other? - Oh, well, I met Katie when we were kids, we grew up together. - Did you date? - No. - No, uh, just friends. Since, what, eighth grade? - No, no, it was seventh, remember? Because it was Mrs. Parker's class. Yeah, friends. - My son, Trevor, and Tommy, they're on the team together. They've been best friends since, what, elementary school? - Yeah. - Oh, where's your wife? - Samantha. - Uh, it's okay, uh, my wife died two years ago. Um, it was tough being alone with Trevor, but Katie was really my rock during that time, and I'm as grateful to her and to your dad as I can be. - So what else do you do besides coach soccer? - I'm a mechanic, I have my own shop over on Brewer Street. - That is so cool, I actually love cars. - You should stop by sometime. - Well, maybe Katie will take me. - Sure, yeah, we can figure it out. - Oh, Sam, pizza. - Well, pizza calls. Um, it was so nice to meet you, Ryan. - Nice to meet you too. - No way, no way, are you kidding? You guys got me a car? What? - Passed your driver's test, right? - Yeah, with flying colors, but I mean, I didn't expect, like, a car. Did you know about this? - Well, I couldn't have you keep asking 'em to drive mine, now could I? - We didn't know about the color, but-- - No, Mom, please, I love it, I love it. Can I go see Trevor? - Uh, yeah, that's fine, but please be home by 10, it is a school night. - Well, I wanna go too. - Come on, let's break this bad boy in. Aww, look at that. - So sweet. - So cute. - Bye. Don't crash it. - Where's my car? - What do you mean where's my car? - Tommy has a car, Lauren has a car, where's mine? - Well, Tommy worked really hard for his car, and Lauren got straight A's for three years, and-- - I wasn't talking to you. I thought that you said I was special? - You are special. - Then why am I being left out again? - Look, I know I wasn't there when you got your license, and I'm really sorry about that, but, today's about Tommy, maybe we could just cool it a little bit and talk about it... - So, everybody gets a fancy car and I get, what, a pink bear? I really see where I fit into this family. Sorry, maybe Ryan can fix that, I heard he's good with his hands. - That was something. I hate to say it, babe, but I'm a little concerned about Sam. Jealousy's normal in these types of new family situations, but her reactions have been a little extreme. - We should get her a car too. - No, no, no, no, this has nothing to do with a car, her jealousy stems from insecurity and desperation for your attention. Maybe this wasn't the best time to get Tommy a new car, but it's done, now we need to focus on giving her a greater sense of security and stability. - Yeah, I didn't even think about how it would make her feel. I mean, I did miss her entire childhood. - I understand that, but she can't go around breaking things every time she gets angry. And we certainly cannot reinforce that behavior with a car. - You're right. You're right, I'm sorry. It's just a lot to take on, - I know, honey. - But I have to face it head on. I'm sorry about your car. It's fine. - You want me to make it up to you? - You're incorrigible. - You mean insatiable. - Oh. - I'll go talk to her. - Thank you. - Maybe I should take one more day off? - No, we talked about this last night. This will give me and Sam a better chance to get to know one another. Plus, I know you're dying to get back to the hospital. - You sure? - I'm sure. - All right. Good morning. - Hey. - Morning. - Morning. - All right, I gotta go to work, I'll see you guys. - Love you. - Bye. - I love you. - Love you. What's got you so bouncy this morning? - Nothing, just happy. That's good. - Ah, morning, Sam. - Morning. - Morning. Morning, Sam. - Hey, uh, Sam, couple of the guys from the team are getting together later, if you wanna join? - Yeah, that sounds great. Lauren, you should come and put in some time with you know who. Oh, yeah, sure. - Who's you know who? - Mom, it's nothing. - Milo Venetta. Sam. - Uh, gross. You like Milo? - Tommy. Stop. - Whatever floats your boat. - Bye, Sam. Later. - Bye. - Bye, have a good day. How'd you sleep last night? Like a rock. - Good. Um, Samantha, Lauren is a little shy when it comes to boys, so I'd appreciate it if you didn't pressure her. - Sorry, I was just trying to help. - It's okay. - So, what's the plan? - Uh, well, I have a client coming in a couple of minutes. - What do you do anyway? - I'm a psychologist. - Oh, wow, that's intense. - Um, it can be, it's very rewarding. - Yeah. Do you wanna psychoanalyze me? - No, no, but I would like to get to know you a little better. - Yeah, I'd like to get to know me better too. - Well, if you ever wanna talk, I'm here. Oh, that's my client. Are you okay for a little while? - Yeah, I'm just gonna study. - Great. Uh, maybe we can grab lunch later? - Yeah, that sounds good. Heather, how you been? - Really well. Good, come on in. - It's been a good week. - Good. Buttons feeling any better? - Yes, Buttons is feeling so much better. - Come on over here, I'm all set up. So, Tuesday, same time? - Yes, I'm putting it in my calendar. - Heather? Is that you? - Samantha, I-- - It's been so long. Do you two know each other? Well, we used to be friends, until she disappeared on me. - I gotta go. - Well, it was nice to see you again. Heather, wait. Heather, Heather, talk to me. Heather, Heather, what do you need? Talk to me, what do you need? - What is she doing here? Why would you have her here? - Who, Samantha? - I can't, I can't be here anymore, I have to go! - Wait, that's the Sam? Hey. Hey. - You still wanna grab some lunch? - Yeah, sure. - So how do you know Heather? - Uh, I spent a lot of time around here a while back. Did you know she's a lifeguard at the beach? - Small world, isn't it? - I can't wait until I see Heather again, we have so much to talk about. - So I was thinking Lighthouse Cafe for lunch? Yeah, I'm easy. - Great. So when does the next semester start? - Um, in a couple of weeks. You excited to go back? - Yeah, I'm excited. It's always good to get back into your old routine, it makes you feel normal again. - What, are you saying I'm not normal? - No, no, no, I wasn't saying that, I just-- I'm just messing with you, Katie. You know, I can help you with your studies if you want. - You, you have a PhD, right? - Yeah, I got it after I had Tommy. What the heck? Oh my. Oh, god, that cannot be good. Oh. - You have to, yeah. This can't be good. Let me call Ryan, hold on, um... Hey, Ry, yeah, it's me, do you have a minute? I think my car is overheating, I'm with Samantha. Uh, yeah, we're on Elkmont Road. Great. Thank you so much. Okay, yeah, we'll be here, bye. Okay. Um, Ryan's gonna come help. I am so sorry, I hope you're not too hungry? - Oh, no, it's totally fine. That's so nice of Ryan to just come running when you call. - Yeah, well, I'm useless when it comes to cars. I leave that to Ryan and your dad. Mm-hmm. - Look, Samantha, Ryan and I have been friends since junior high, I love your father. - Okay, did I say any different? - No, I just want you to be able to trust me and know that I'm here for you, okay? Whatever you need. - I had a mom, I don't need another one. God. - All right, radiator hose is busted. It's not a big fix, but definitely important. - Okay. - Ryan, is that a, is that a '68? - You do like cars. - Yeah, my ex was way into cars, so, he taught me a lot. - Thank you so much, Ryan, this is honestly above and beyond. - Oh, anything for you, Katie. - Hey, are you gonna go to that thing on Saturday? - Yeah, I think we're probably gonna show up maybe around 5:30, and, um, maybe I'll see you the next day at practice, right? Yes. Okay, yeah. Trevor and I will meet you over there, we'll go out for ice cream after. Oh, that'd be so great-- Are you guys done yet? - Uh, I'm gonna need some time with this. Uh, maybe I can lend you my car for the day while I fix this? - No, you do not have to do that. - No, it's all right, I'll drive your car back home when it's done, and I'll pick up my car there. - That would actually be awesome, thank you so much, I really appreciate it. - Yeah, have fun at lunch. We will. - Thanks. - Oh, rats, I have a patient coming in 10, do you mind if we rain-check, Sam? - No worries. - Okay. - Oh! - Oh! - What'd I say, Tommy? - Okay, you won. - All right, Sam versus Lauren now. - It's a done deal. - Woo! - You wanna go? - Get in here. - All right. Go for it. - All right, let's go. - Woo. - All right, all right. - Okay, ready? - Okay, ready? - Count in, please, boys. Ready? On three. - One, - One, - two, - two, - three. - Three. - I think Lauren's got it. - They're down there for a long time, dude. - Yeah. - Damn. - What was that? - What was what? - You were holding my legs and I couldn't breathe. - What are you talking about? - Did you see that? - Uh, no, you were under water, so... - Okay, who's gonna, who's gonna go against me? This guy. - All right. - Woo! Hey. Everything all right? - It's fine, Mom. - Uh, it doesn't seem fine, what's up? - It's... Really, I'm okay, I'm gonna go wash up. - Are you sure I can't convince you to stay for dinner? - Oh, not tonight, Kitty Kat. - Oh my, Kitty Kat? You haven't called me that in... - It still works. - No. - Hey, I got something for you. - What? - Check that out. - What? Oh, my gosh. Is this from the River Run Festival? Yeah, yeah. Wow. - Hey, you remember when that drunk guy spilled his beer all over me? That was crazy, - Yes. - But not as crazy as when you bought one and spilled it all over yourself so I wouldn't be alone. - Can I be honest with you? I did not do that on purpose. - You didn't? No. No, I fell and spilled it all over, and I was playing it off like I did it on purpose to be a good friend, but in reality, I, uh, was a total klutz. - Sorry, am I interrupting? - Oh, hey, Sam. Nah, um, I was just dropping your mom's car off. See you later. - Bye, Ry, I owe you, thank you. - See ya. That swimming really killed me today. - I told you I'd kick your butt. - Yeah, okay, you may be good in the water, but just wait til we get on, like, a run. That sounds like a challenge. Well, what if it is? Then, challenge accepted. - Yes. Lauren, you down? - Uh, I don't know, Student Council's starting to plan Homecoming, so, I'm really busy. - Tommy, you should invite Milo again, I'm sure Lauren would love that. - Lauren likes Milo, Lauren likes Milo, - No, I don't! - Lauren likes Milo. Hello? - Dad. - Ooh, dinner, sorry I'm late. - Uh, Mom, can I be excused? I've got a lot of work to do. Yeah, sweetie. - What's going on? - Oh, nothing, Lauren just has a crush on a boy at school, and she won't admit it. No, I don't! - Samantha, I would really appreciate it if you didn't tease Lauren like that. - Wait, seriously? - Yeah, seriously. I think you owe her an apology. - Uh, fine. Oh, Ryan, you are so boring. - What were you doing in there? - Nothing. Oh, Lauren, um... - Yeah? - Goodnight. Hey, thanks for backing me up down there. You're really upset about that? - You rolled your eyes, it's not cool. - I just think you're making it out to be more than it is. - You haven't been around the last few days, but that's not the first time I've had to say something to her about how she's speaking to my daughter. - Your daughter? You don't mean our daughter? - That's not what I meant, okay? Don't twist my words, I'm just saying that Samantha has a lot of influence. Okay, she's older, she's getting attention from boys that Lauren's interested in, even Tommy seems to be on her side, I just don't want everybody ganging up on Lauren. - I just think you need to relax a little and stop worrying about preventing problems before they start. - Look, I know you're off saving lives, but I'm trying to keep the peace around here, and, I, I, we just, we need to have a united front, okay? So if I say something, I need you to back me up. - Okay. - Say it. - I'll back you up. - Damn right you will. - Ooh, yeah, I will back you up, Mrs. Carlisle. - It's Dr. Carlisle. Oh, excuse me, Doctor. - But, I'm serious. Oh, I am so serious, so serious. - Happy anniversary. - Happy anniversary. Happy anniversary. - Oh, you guys. Aww, oh, my gosh. - Pancakes. - This looks beautiful. - Tommy helped this time. - Beautiful, oh. Oh, come on. Oh, look. Yes. - You guys. - I love it. That's great. - Thank you. - All right, well, while we're handing out surprises... - No, we said we weren't gonna give each other anything. No, you said that. It's our anniversary, of course I'm gonna get you something. - Oh my, how did you do this? Third row center, and I got us a suite at the London. - Oh, thanks, honey. - And we got you reservations at Asterio Romana. Oh, my goodness. - I just wanted to say the past month has been so special to me. You guys, you brought me into your family, you made me feel so welcome, so, thank you, and happy anniversary. Oh, come here, you guys. Oh, cuddles. - All right, get in here, get in here. - Where are my pictures? Hey, Greg? Katie, are you ready? - Uh... Yeah, yeah, coming. - In case you need anything. - Thank you. - We can trust you guys for one night, right? - Yes. - We'll be back tomorrow afternoon, be good. Eat, do your homework. Love you. - Love you. - Bye, have fun. - Bye, we love you. - Love you, you deserve this, enjoy it. So, I think I'm gonna tell a few friends to swing by. You should invite Milo. - What? No, that'd be weird, he'll think I like him. - But you do like him. - You don't have to invite just Milo, you can invite other people. - Uh, we can't have a party. - Who said it was a party? Tommy, did you call it a party? - I never called it a party. - So, should we do it? - Okay, fine, sure, let's do it. - Okay, um, Tommy, invite Milo. - I already texted him. - Great, sounds good. Why are you all by yourself? It's a party. - I'm tired. - Well, just so you know, Milo was just looking for you. Now you're not so tired. - What did he say? - Okay, he told me that he wants to have some alone time with you, you know, to get to know you better. Really? Well, I mean, if he wants to talk to me... - I mean, you should go to your bedroom. - Okay. Hey, we're having fun, man, we're having fun. Ooh, give me that bone. - Hey, uh, Milo, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure. - Okay, I'm gonna help you out. - Oh, yeah? Do I need help? - Well, you know Lauren, she kind of has a thing for you. She actually wants you to go meet her in her bedroom right now. - For real? - Yeah, so you should probably go take care of her. - Oh, um, I don't know, I'm not into her, I'm into you. - Oh, okay, well, um, maybe if you go take care of her, I'll take care of you. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Okay. Oh, Milo, um, between you and me, Lauren confessed to me that she's kind of into some weirder stuff. - Weird stuff like? - I don't know, I don't wanna judge her, but, um, I think she likes it pretty rough. - Okay. Sam. What's up? - Hey, not much. - You having fun? - Yeah. - Love it, cheers. - Cheers. - Hey. - Hey. Uh, you're a really good soccer player, like, really good. - I mean, for Saint Francis, maybe, but, Notre Dame? - You got in to Notre Dame? - Yeah. - Oh, wow. That's insane. You'd do great at Notre Dame, it's a really good school, and you'd get an amazing education, and being there... Wait. - What's wrong? - It's just a little too fast for me. Don't worry. - Milo, stop. Come on, we're just having a good time. - No, please. Milo, stop. It's okay, relax. Please, it's too fast for me, please. - Hi, um, I'd like to file a noise complaint. Yeah, yeah, it's at 21 Briar Lane. - Guys, the cops are here, the cops are here, come on! Come on, we gotta go! - Hey, Greg. - Hey, Jordan. - Sorry to give this to you. See you in church Sunday? I'll see you, thanks for coming out. No problem. Samantha, we trusted you. We left you in charge, how could you let this happen? - Wait, me? It wasn't my idea, Lauren's the one that wanted to have a party. - I know Lauren, she would never do something like this. - Katie, they're teenagers, this is what teenagers do, we can't blame it all on Sam. - Lauren wanted to invite Milo over, but didn't have the guts to invite just him, so she wanted a party. - I wanted him to come over, but I didn't think it was gonna get this out of hand. I'm sorry. - Are you okay, sweetie? - I have to go to bed. Okay, it's been a long night, we're all tired, let's, we'll talk about it in the morning? Let's go. - Come on. - But like a day's training. - Okay. You know? You know what I mean. - She's coming right now. Yo, I told you she had nice legs, bro. - Hey, you can't let him talk to your sister like that. Hey, Lauren, where you going? Lauren? - Yo, what the hell, Milo? - Hey, what's up, Tommy? - Why are you talking to my sister like that? - It's not my fault your sister's so easy. - Why don't you just leave her alone, all right? - Security, hey, there's a fight happening over there, those two kids. - Yo, none of us buy that innocent act anymore. She's a freak. She likes it rough. - Yeah, ha. - Yo, what the-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, relax, relax. I saw that, I saw that, I saw that, - Yeah, he saw it. - Let's go, Tommy. - Relax, relax. - I'm sorry. Yeah, not so pretty anymore, are you? - You guys are home late. What's up? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Are they always this moody? - No, they're not. Lauren, honey, can I come in? Hey, what's going on? - Nothing. - It's okay, is it something at school? We can talk about it, I promise we can fix this. - No, we can't. Nothing is okay, it is all my fault. - Sweetheart, you gotta tell me what's going on, okay? That's the only way I can help you. - Samantha said that Milo liked me, that he wanted to get to know me better, and that I should have him up in my room, and we started kissing, and I wasn't ready, and then things got aggressive. - Sweetheart, this is not your fault. - Yes, it is. And he's got a picture of me. I don't know how he took it, but he sent it to all of his friends, and now everyone thinks I had sex with him. And the thing is, is I really liked him. Oh, honey. Milo was trying to take advantage of you, okay? You didn't do anything wrong. Come here, sweetheart. Oh. It's gonna be okay, all right? - Thanks, Mom. So, what happened with you? - Mom, I'm sorry, but, I got suspended for punching Milo Venetta in the face. - Wow. Well, punching someone is never a good idea, but I think I understand why you did it. - Yeah? - Lauren told me what happened. - He had a picture of her. He showed it around like, like it was some trophy or something. Lauren's not like that. Greg Hello, I'm home. - Well, I am very proud of you for standing up for your sister. - Thanks, Mom. - But you're grounded. Hey. - Hey. What's going on? Samantha just told me that Tommy got suspended. - Let's go upstairs. I think there's something wrong with Samantha. - What are you talking about? - You know that party wasn't Lauren's idea. Lauren said it was her idea, why are you trying to make it Sam's fault? - I'm not trying to make it Sam's fault, it's the truth. - It's not like they threw some rager. - They did throw a rager, she bought them alcohol. - Katie, I think you're overreacting. - I'm overreacting? Did you know that Lauren almost got raped? - What? - Yeah, and guess who set that up to happen, Samantha. Okay, I mean, can you even hear yourself right now? - Greg, I think you're so wrapped up in trying to get Samantha to like you that you're not actually parenting her. - Please don't tell me how to talk to my daughter. - What about your other daughter? I mean, have you even spoken to Lauren? I have to go. - Of course you do. - Katie, can we please talk about this some other time? I have so much going on at the hospital right now. - What choice do I have? Go, just go. Okay. Good morning, North Valley residents, it's the Morning News with Elaine Paige. - Lauren hasn't spoken to me in days, like, what's her problem? - I don't know, I think she's still pretty upset from the Milo thing. - I told her inviting him up to her bedroom would give him the wrong idea. - Wait, she invited him up? Lauren said you did. - Really? I don't know why she would lie to you. I guess she's embarrassed. - Yeah, I don't know. - We gotta keep sticking together, I have your back and you have mine, right? - Yeah, for sure. - I mean, we all had fun at the party, you had fun, right? - Yeah, a great time. - Well, we just won't invite her next time, it'll be just the two of us, deal? - Deal. - Tommy, don't you have some chores to do? - I don't think so. - Thomas, now. - Fine. - Samantha, I think you should start thinking about getting a job. - What? - If you're not gonna go back to school, you need to work, you're an adult. - But I'm grieving, Katie, don't you see that? Start looking. Coming up next on our morning segment, Today. What you need to do to your house this summer. But for now, we transfer over to our local news broadcast. - The search for 22-year-old Heather Hewitt continues today. Hewitt was reported missing by her parents after she failed to attend a court hearing for a parking violation. Authorities have begun a search-and-rescue effort in Sactacose Woods, a local wildlife-- You have reached the voice mailbox of... Heather Hewitt. - Hey, Heather, it's Katie again. Um, I'm sorry to leave you another message, I, I'm just checking in, wanna make sure everything's okay. Uh, give me a call anytime. Okay, bye. Hey. - Oh, hey, Kitty, I wasn't expecting you. I know, do you have a minute? - Yeah, is everything all right? - I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I think there's something wrong with Samantha. - Is that the scientific term for it now, Doc? - I know, I know, but just listen, she's, it's, I'm just getting a really weird vibe off of her. - Hello, I'm home. - Hey, Daddy. - Oh, hey, where is everybody? - Um, Tommy's upstairs, Lauren is at school, and I think that Katie went to go see Ryan. They're pretty close, aren't they? - Well, yeah, I mean, they have a long history. - Yeah, they hang out a lot. He just comes over all the time when you're not around. - What do you mean? - He just comes over, not to drop off Trevor or anything. They hang out, they hug a lot, like, when they're laughing and stuff, and she actually goes over to his place a lot too. I can tell they're super close. - Yeah. When did Katie say she'd be back? - Uh, she didn't, but I think she left, like, an hour ago. I'm gonna go for a run. - All right. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye, sweetie. - I just feel like she's manipulating Greg and the kids. I mean, Tommy's suspended, Lauren is a mess, and Greg and I are fighting. Oh, and this patient of mine, who apparently knows Samantha, she saw her at the house the other day and she was terrified, like, ran to her car to get away terrified. And now, after three years of never missing an appointment, she's a no-show. - Hey, it's me. Are you gonna pick up your phone or just keep ignoring my calls? I've called you, like, four times. All right, well, I guess just give me a call when you get this. Is she kidding me right now? - I know there's something off, but Greg doesn't wanna hear it, and, I don't know, I'm just feeling really alone. - Katie, you are not alone. I mean, I am there for you if you need anything. Thanks, Ry, I appreciate it. What's going on? - Nothing. - Doesn't look like nothing. - Yeah, I was just talking to Katie and-- - He was just supporting me, Greg, that's all he was doing. - Oh, that's what you call it? 'Cause at least I don't sneak around behind your back with a friend. Don't be ridiculous. - I'm gonna give you two some privacy, I... - Oh, privacy? That's rich, coming from some guy who clearly doesn't understand boundaries. - You know, Greg, there's a lot I wanna say to you, but I'm not going to. Katie, if you need me, I'm here. - Okay. Uh, thanks. Greg, you're acting like a jealous teenager. - How much time do you spend with him when I'm not around? - Don't talk to me like you're Mr. Perfect. You're never around, and when you are, now, it's all about Samantha. What about Tommy and Lauren? I mean, can't you see this family's falling apart? - This conversation is not over. - Looks like it is. - Extra bacon, please. A little fog to start off our day, we may get some hints of clouds yet, but more clouds and sunny skies. And now, over to our local news broadcast. - Tragedy has struck our small community today, as the search for Heather Hewitt concluded. Authorities recovered her body from the northeast quadrant of Sactacose Woods, and have opened a criminal investigation of the case. Hewitt was found with multiple stab wounds in her chest and abdomen, and the county medical examiner puts her time of death at approximately one week ago, which is just a day before she was reported missing by her parents. There will be a memorial service for Hewitt at the Community Church of Hempstead later this week. She is survived by her parents, Mark and Barbara, and her younger brother. - Oh, my god, Katie, why are you yelling at me? It was just an accident! - What's going on? Are you okay? - Katie is yelling at me because I broke the plate, and now she's saying I have to leave! - Seriously? - No, that is, that is not what she did, she held it up in front of my face and just... - Sam, are you okay? I don't wanna talk about it. Do you just wanna go for a run or something? - Yeah, let's go. - No, no, uh, Tommy, I need you to stay here and help me with something. - I'll help you when I get back. We're gonna be gone for, like, an hour? - No, you can't leave the house, you're grounded. - First you take my car, I can't go out at night, now I can't even train? I thought you understood why I punched Milo? - For Pete's sakes, Katie, let him go for a run. - Unless there's a reason you don't want him to? - You guys can go. Let's go. If you ask me, it sounds like you need to handle your own jealousy issues. - Yeah, wait, hold on, Sam, I gotta tie my shoe, one second. I bet you can't catch me. - We'll see about that. Sam? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy? - Sam? I'm over here. - Yo, Sam? Sam, where'd you go? Nope, you're getting warmer. - Sam? Sam, where are you? Sam? - Hey, Tommy? Sam? Sam, why'd you do that? - I didn't do anything, you tripped. - You pushed me down the hill! - No, I didn't. - I need you to call someone, my leg, I think it's broken. - I don't have service. Um, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go get Katie. - No, don't leave me here. Sam, please don't, Sam. Sam! - Katie? - Yeah? - Katie, are you here? - Yeah. - It's Tommy, he fell, and I think he's hurt pretty bad. - Oh, my god, uh, show me. I got my keys. - How's he doing? - He's okay now, but it's not good. - So what happened? - Tommy went running with Samantha and she pushed him down a hill. - What? - That's what Tommy said, and I believe him. Greg, she did it on purpose. - No, she didn't. - Greg, Tommy fell down the hill and she didn't even call me. She walked all the way home first. - Maybe her cell wasn't working, or people get scared, maybe she wasn't thinking clearly. - She wasn't scared, okay? She just left him there, alone, what kinda person does that? - People panic, Katie. We don't know what was going through her head. - You're right, I don't know what's going through her head, I just know that from the minute she got here, everything's gone wild, and that's not a coincidence. - I think that you're trying to make her out to be the bad guy 'cause you never wanted her here in the first place. - Wow, I never realized what little you thought of me. - It's not that I think little of you, Katie, it's just that you don't know what her mother was like. She's led a rough life, and this is the first time she's ever had any real family. - Greg, she's dangerous, to herself and to others, and until you're willing to let me get her a psyche eval, I can't have my children in the same house as her. - And what if you're wrong? I've already lost Sam once, I can't lose her again based on paranoia. I need proof. - What happened? Are you okay? - Here, come on in, you got it? Lauren, where's Samantha? - I don't know, I haven't seen her since she got home. - Okay, why don't you go grab a seat on the couch, okay? Will you help him? I'll be right back. - What's going on? - Tommy? Lauren? - Mom? - We're leaving. Help Tommy pack a bag, just one, and I'm gonna bring the car around, okay? Hey, I was right, and I have proof. Don't come home, it's not safe. I'm gonna take the kids and go to the Sheffield Hotel, just meet us there, bye. You looking for these? - Yeah. Uh, I'm just gonna take the kids outta town for a couple days and, uh, just let Tommy recuperate, and you can have some one-on-one time with your Dad. - How stupid do you think that I am? Ryan, hey. - Oh, hey there, Sam. I heard Tommy broke his leg, is he all right? - Oh, yeah, yeah, he's fine, I think he just needs some rest. - And, uh, how's Katie holding up? Is she inside? - Um, no, actually, she just went to the store to get a few things for Tommy. - At this hour? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure she knows where she's going. - Kids alone inside? - Alone? I mean, I'm here. - Right. Well, if you need me... - Yeah, I'll have Katie, um, give you a call. - Sam, what are you doing? What are you doing? - Oh, my god. Tommy! Tommy! - I forgot about Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Tommy? - What? Tommy, are you up here? - Yeah. She killed him. - Who? - Samantha killed Ryan. - What? - I don't know where Mom is, but we gotta get outta here. - All right, let's get out-- - Shh. Bathroom, we can lock ourselves in. - Go. Okay. - What do we do? - Did you call the police? - Yeah, I called the cops, they're on their way. - Will they get there in time? - I hope so, I mean, it was... Okay, just stay quiet. - Come out, come out wherever you are. - Shh. Don't say a word. Shh. - Huh, a door that locks itself. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. I guess the hard way. - Samantha, put down the knife. We can work this out. - There's nothing to work out. My mother kept me from the only person who ever cared about me, so you have to be eliminated just like her. - I'm sorry she did that to you. You deserve better than that. We're not trying to keep you from Greg, we want you to be a part of this family. - You don't care about me. I know that I'm messing up your perfect little world. And you know, I used to come here every summer, and I would watch you. That should've been my life, you stole it from me. - Samantha, listen, we can fix this. Greg loves you very much. - I don't think you understand, there's no going forward from here. How can you, how can anyone help me? - I know this seems hard, but you have options, and we'll be with you the whole way. - Why would you help me after everything that I've done? - We're family, you belong here. Just put the knife down. You're family, Samantha. Okay? Just give me the knife. - Samantha, what are you doing? - Oh, I'm doing this for you. - Samantha, no, you have to stop this. - You're taking her side? I'm your daughter. You called the cops on me? - Honey... - Don't honey me. You betrayed me. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - Are you okay? Are you okay? - What? - I'm just thinking about how lucky I am to have a wife that's so wonderful, and forgiving, and beautiful. - Go on. - And smart. - Mm-hmm. - And kind. And the bravest person I know. And way out of my league. - Well, that's for sure.
