Get lively. The fleet is coming around the bight. They are ringing the bell. Here you are, father. Go along with you now. Take the catch to the ice station. Then be going home and get supper ready. Sure, father. Sure. And what will you be having for supper? One of them fishes? What else? Well. I was thinking of a chicken. With dumplings and vegetables. You'll cook fish and be liking it. Sure, it does no harm to be thinking. Come on, Michael. Hello Sheila. - Hello Peg. Hello Mrs Fogarty. Did you see anything of my daddy, Peg? He's not with the fleet. Your man took the inside channel. For some nets he lost against the reefs. The reefs? Sure, the tide will be rushing high there this minute. And the dark coming on. Wish me what? What talk have you? I'm sure Danny could find his way through the reefs blindfolded. Heard the news, Peg? - No. Rafferty the left-hand fiddler and some pipers are here from Galloway. There will be dancing tonight. Glory be. It's weeks since I've danced. Come on. My fine young boy. Can you tell me where I can find Patrick Shamus O'Connell? I can that. My fine lady. What do you mean, 'lady'? What do you mean by 'boy'? I am Patrick O'Connell's daughter, Peg. That is my father over there. Yes, of course. I should have seen the resemblance in the .. It's in the pants I'm thinking. It's very convenient. We both wear the same size. Whoever gets up sooner has first choice. Peg. - Yes, father? Over there with the fish. Alright. I'll be going. Goodbye, sir. Bye, Miss O'Connell. Are you Mr O'Connell? - The same. I'd like to speak to you for a moment. Come aboard. - Thank you. Well, what have you to say? You married Heather Kingsnorth, didn't you? Aye. But she's been gone these long years. Rest her soul. My name is Gerald Markham. I am the executor of the Kingsnorth estate. You are aware that Squire Kingsnorth is dead? I was not. When did they hang him? You will be please do learn that his granddaughter .. Your daughter, Margaret. Inherits his entire estate. What's that you're saying? Wyatt Kingsnorth left your daughter. Two million pounds. Holy saints. He wouldn't lend me a penny when my wife, his daughter, was dying. And now he's leaving my daughter, Peg, all that money. Miss O'Connell must spend 3 years in the family of a Mrs Chichester. It's a way of making a lady of her, I suppose? I'll admit there are some things I can't teach her. But I'll not be living with Mrs Chichester or whatever you call her. No. You couldn't. One of the conditions is that you are not to be with your daughter. Not to be with Peg for 3 years? Old Kingsnorth sends his ghost to come between me and my daughter for 3 years? Two million pounds. Three years will not be forever. That will soon pass. In the meantime I can .. Be seeing Peg occasionally. That's just it. According to the will. The separation between you and your daughter must be complete. And permanent. Permanent? - Yes. That is .. Forever, ain't it? And them are .. Old Kingsnorth's conditions? Yes. There's a paper for you to sign. - You can take your paper. And your conditions. And burn them. Under the miserable soul of old Kingsnorth. And may the devil make it hot for him. There's the music of the dance, father. 'Wish to the song', they're playing. Your mother's favourite. There's a light in your eyes, sweetheart darling. And it makes all the world fair and bright. Like the light in the sky, sweetheart darling. When the morning steals out of the night. You are just like her. You are. The spitting image. Come. You'll be late with your supper. Come on. Sure. I will, dad. Not that I'm blaming you for wanting to be singing and dancing more than this. Boiled potatoes and mackerel. Day in and day out. Don't you get tired of it sometimes, Peg? Well, I might like a bit of a change sometimes. A change? What kind of a change? I believe I'd like herring. Once in a while. Herring is good too. But then I was .. Thinking of another kind of a change. It is little pleasure you have. Living this kind of a life with an old man. Won't you be getting tired of me, Peg? Tired of you? What talk have you? I would not change you for a million pounds. No. But would you change me for .. Two million pounds? I would not. Not for all the money in the world. It is well. And all, Peg. You'll be forgetting that someday and marrying like your friend Sheila. Sure. And when I fall in love. It will be with a fine, handsome upstanding man like .. Like the one that ran away with my mother. It's as well you know there are no more men living like me. It must be sweet to be made love to by a grand, modest man like yourself. I don't see how my mother resisted you as long as she did. How do you know how long she resisted me? Well, I don't. But however long it was. I must doubt if I could have done as well. Oh, you have a way with you. Patrick O'Connell. You lie like like an angel. Peg o' my heart. My father was Irish, my mother was English. And speaking of Irish people and things. I will sing an Irish melody. There's a light in your eyes, sweetheart darling. And it makes all the world fair and bright. Like the light in the sky, sweetheart darling. When the morning steals out .. Of the night. It is love light that's shining for someone. Sure, I'm wondering just who it could be. I thought you'd gone away. There's no train until tomorrow. It's your chance to see what kind of a person cannot be bought with money. There's a light in your eyes, sweetheart darling. Tell my darling. It is shining. For me. Hurray! There is a light in your eyes. [ Bell ringing ] What does the bell mean? - It means something has happened. Ahoy, the lifeboat. Ahoy the beach. What's that you're towing after you? It's the wreck of The Sheila. The Sheila? It was on the reefs. And the crew? All hands lost. Peg. Peg. She's sure to be in. I'll call her. - Right. Peg. Be right there. Come on, Michael. Come on. What is it, father? Saints preserve us. I never thought to be seeing you this morning. And me in my old clothes. Peg. This is Sir Gerald Markham. Your Honour. Your Highness I mean. I was pleased to meet Miss O'Connell before. I'm very happy to see you again. Sure. Sure, it's a great honour to meet a Sir. Sir Gerald, sir. That's the same thing as being a king, ain't it, Your highness? No. Not king. That means he is only a knight or a baronet or something. There are baronets all over England. Thicker than plums in a pudding. We've never had plum pudding. Your Highness. You can have a lot of plum puddings from now on. That's why I came to see your father. - Did you now? Travelling all the way from London to see us about plum puddings. Think of that, father. Well. If you excuse me I'll take a stroll. You can tell your daughter all about it. - I'll be thanking you, sir. What is it, father? I've seen you look like that in my mother's picture. Tell me. Peg. You are an heiress. Huh? An heiress, I said. Sure. I'm an heiress. And you are the Prince of Wales. And Michael will be like the President of Ireland. It is true. It is. Old Kingsnorth died and left you two million pounds. You're rich. So rich it's almost entirely unbelievable. You can have anything you want. I'll take it then. How much did you say? - Two million pounds. Two million pounds. Let me see. I'll be getting you the red flannels you will need for your cough next winter. And I'll be buying Michael a brass collar. With his name written on it. And a crib for Sheila's baby that's coming fatherless. And a dress for myself. Maybe two dresses. And I'll be buying some new boots to go fishing in. You'll not be going fishing. Not fitting for a great lady like yourself that you'll be. To go fishing for mackerel. It is in England you will be living. In England? Do you think we'll be liking it in England? Your mother came from England. Sure. And so did His Honour. Maybe there's one or two nice people there. When do we go? It's on the noon train you leave. So better turn to your packing. Holy saints. Why didn't you tell me? I need to wash my hand-me-downs. How about yourself? Never mind about me. I'm not going with you. Not going? - No. Then I'm not going either. I mean I'm not going with you just now. - And why not? Well. There is this and that to attend to. - For instance? You can't leave the Peg o' My Heart. To rot out by the quay all by herself, could you? Well, I can wait for you. - No, Peg. You have to go. You're expected. You are an heiress. And an heiress always has to be on the dot, so she do. When will you be coming after me? - It will not be long. You'll be coming soon or I'll be back. Mind you that now. Michael, get away. Michael, you can't get in the bag with the other things. What's that you're doing, trampling down my garden? We've come to be seeing you off to London, Peg. Sure. It's a darling, you are. But I'm blinded the thoughts of leaving you. Sure. You won't be forgetting us, Peg. No matter where I wander, on land or on the foam. When I see shamrocks growing. I know I'm safe at home. A train I thought be going. A ship may be on the foam. But when I see shamrocks growing. I'll know I'm safe at home. We'll remember. Only you. As each happy .. Day comes smiling through. And when you. Are far away. We'll dream of you both night and day. Sure. It is ready I am. Let me help you. - Thank you, Your Highness. Your Honour, I mean. It's too much of a load for me to carry. Sure you haven't forgotten anything? - What is there to forget? Oh yes. I forgot to be asking you. How do I be getting to England? Sir Gerald will take you. Do you think we need a chaperone? No, Your Honour. I would have no room in my bag. I mean a third person. Well, there will be you and me and Michael. If that's what you mean. - The dog's going with us? And why shouldn't he be? - Yes. Come on, Michael. Come on. No. I think I'll be leaving Michael here with you. He would be missing the both of us. I'll not be missing Michael. This is the first time. You and me have ever been apart. I know it. I know it. It will not be for long. Come along now. You'll be having the time of your life. With the dancing, theatres and fine clothes and all. Sure I will, father. It will be grand riding on a train. I will be riding on a train, won't I? On a big steamboat and a train again. It steams forever away. Not very far. Just the Irish Sea between us. That's all. I'll be saving all the best times until you get there. Wait a minute. I'll be saying goodbye to Michael. Goodbye, Michael. See that you take good care of my father. Be reminding him to change his socks when his feet are wet. I was just thinking. Who will darn your socks while we are away from each other? With all the money we'll be getting I can be buying a new pair every week. That's right. I never thought of that. Well. I can't say goodbye, father. We'll not be mentioning it. We won't be crying either, my girl. We'll be laughing. All ready, Mr O'Connell. I'm coming. Tell me that name again. So I will feel warm until you come after me. Call me your name for me. Peg o' My Heart. Alright. Get up in your fine carriage now, my girl. Goodbye, Peg. Father. Drive hard. Quick. Goodbye, father. Michael, it will break your heart, won't it? She'll be needing you more than I do. Go along with her. Go on. Here we are, Peg. Let's start now for someplace else, Your Honour. Timbuktu for instance. Sir Gerald. You are expected, sir. Right. Come on, Peg. - Your Honour. Is that .. herself? No. That is one of the servants. She seems unfriendly-like. I'm hoping better from Mrs Chiches .. Mrs Chichester. - Mrs Chichester. Chichester. You sort-of have to sneeze and jump at it, don't you? Smith. - Yes, sir? Is Miss Chichester here? - She's in the sitting room. I'll tell her you're here, Sir Gerald. - Never mind, Smith. We'll go in. I had better tell her myself. Very good, sir. No. In here, Peg. Sure, it is bigger by the inside than it is by the outside, Your Honour. Let's hope it will soon seem like home to you. Like home? Sure. It is more the size of the Dublin fish market. Yes. I grant you that. But it hasn't the same satisfying smell. There isn't a gaboon in the place, Your Honour. Gaboon? That's just the stylish way of saying 'spitoon'. A man who chews tobacco like my father wouldn't be comfortable here. What with running to the fireplace every few minutes. You wait here, Peg. While I go and tell Mrs Chichester we've arrived. You wouldn't leave me here alone, Your Honour? Only for a moment or so. She'll be down immediately I'm sure to welcome you. That's what I'm most afraid of. - Afraid? Afraid of what? Meeting herself. I'm afraid I'll be shaming you. I'm not really a lady you know. Does your father think that? No. But. Neither do I. I'll be remembering that, Your Honour. Sure. He is a great comfort to us, Michael. This place seems twice as big with him gone. I beg your pardon. Are you Mr Chichester? - I am not. Mr Chichester is dead. - I'm that sorry now. What did he die of? Pneumonia, I believe. There were complications. Oh, that's terrible. Pneumonia. It's like he went fishing. Like my father without his flannels. Mustard is good for it. Use the flour with .. Say. If you're not Mr Chichester then who are you? I am Jarvis. I am pleased to meet you, Mr Jarvis. My own name now is 'Peg'. My father calls me that. His name is Michael. Michael has no manners neither. May I ask what you're doing here, young woman? Waiting. And what are you doing? I am the butler. It's a funny job you've got, ain't it. Walking around looking mad all the time. What is it that you want here? - We want nothing. His Honour said to wait. And we're waiting. His Honour? - Sure. His Honour, Sir Gerald. Oh, Sir Gerald. Then perhaps if Sir Gerald asked you to wait .. you'd best do so. We was going to. He's not liking dogs very much. I could tell it by the look in his eyes. Keep away from the toe of his boot, my lad. [ Piano music ] Music, Michael. Do you hear it? [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] Darling. Chris. Pay no attention to me at all. Go right ahead with your kissing. I'll be picking up the pieces so you won't be cutting your feet. I'm thinking maybe a bit of glue will mend it. The only trouble is, trying to get the pieces to fit together. What are you doing here? I heard your music and stopped in. It was beautiful. Can you play .. 'The Minstrel Boat Has Gone'? It's a great favourite of my father's. How do you happen to be in here? We was waiting, ma'am, to see Mrs Chichester. Then you should wait in the kitchen. Does she do her own cooking? Will you please go? To the kitchen. Yes, ma'am. Michael. Michael. Michael. Michael. Come along with you. Don't mind me seeing you kissing. Sure. Kissing is nothing at all. My father says. That loving without kissing .. Is like fishing without bait. A jolly little apparition, isn't she. - You think so? Chris. That might just as easily have been mother. You were away a long time. - Happy to be back. Ethel. Ethel dear. There's mother. Better go now. You haven't said whether .. - I'll let you know. You'd better go. - No kiss, no go. Alright. Back for tea? - Rather. Ethel. Coming. Ethel, dear. Gerry is here. Gerry. Ethel. When did you get here? - Just a moment ago. How lovely you are. You're rather nice yourself. Did you miss me? - Hmm. As much as I missed you? Perhaps. Perhaps what? Perhaps more. Gerry. - Yes? Where is our little guest? That's funny. I left her right here. Who are you talking about? - Miss O'Connell. The little Irish girl. Good heavens. I've sent her to the kitchen. - To the kitchen? Ethel, dear. You ought to know better than that. What on earth were you thinking of? Well. From the way she talked I thought she was applying for service. She is rather .. You'll like her when you know her. I think she's impossible. We can't have her in the house. You have nothing to say about it. She is going to stay here. We need the money. You seem to forget we are penniless. Jarvis. There's a strange young woman in the kitchen. Yes, madam. Very strange. Show her in here at once, Jarvis. Really, Ethel dear. You mustn't be so careless another time. Hello, mater. - Hello, my boy. Ah, Gerry. Hello Ethel. You're back I see. Did you bring our Irish boarder with you? Alaric. Don't be vulgar. Might as well laugh about it, mater. I say, how much cold cash do we get for board and lodging? At this jolly old Chichester Tavern. About five thousand pounds a year. Isn't that right, Gerry? Quite right. Though she doesn't know you're being paid for doing this. I thought it would be pleasanter for everyone if you treated her as a guest. She is really very sweet and charming. Give me back my bag. - I was just taking it. If anybody is going to do the taking, I am going to do the taking. Touch my bags again there will be a wake in your family beginning tomorrow. Peg. Peg, what's the trouble? He keeps trying to snatch my bag. Jarvis may have a tactless manner but all he's trying to do is to help you. I'm thinking he needs training in manners. Yes. Probably. That will do, Jarvis. Here. Let me take your bags. - No, no. I'm not letting go of my bags. You trust me, don't you? Sure. He won't be coming back, will he? - Of course not. Come on. You must meet your new friends. - Meet my new friends? Come here, Michael. We're going to meet your new friends. Mrs Chichester. This is Margaret O'Connell. How do you do, my dear? I am pleased to meet you, ma'am. Mr Alaric Chichester. Cheerio. Pip-pip. A cheer and two peeps to you too. Miss Ethel Chichester. Miss Ethel and me have met before. After a manner of speaking. We have a little secret together. - Yes. I hope you'll forgive me for sending you to the kitchen. Don't you be worrying about that now, Miss. And. Here is my hand on it. My dear. I am sure we shall all get along very nicely together. Let me see. You're called Margaret, aren't you? No. My name is Peg. My father calls me that, ma'am. Well, we shall call you Margaret. Don't blame me if I don't answer, ma'am. And don't call me ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I mean .. No, ma'am. I presume you had better call me 'Aunt'. Yes, Ant. Aunt. Not 'Ant'. An ant is an insect. Sure I know. I have had them. The little red ones are the worst. They jump on your legs and crawl up into your pants until you're fair crazy. Peg. But they do jump and bite, Your Honour. Yes. But it's best to ignore them. Have you ever had ants in your pants, Your Honour? In conversation, I mean. Yes, Your Honour. I am that covered with shame, ma'am. At what I have said, ma'am. Aunt. I'm sure you meant well, my dear. Gerry, we're expecting a few friends for tea. You will stay of course? - Thank you. But I must leave for London within the hour. A few final details about Peg's .. Margaret's estate. You aren't going and leaving me here? I'll go with you. I say. I'll be here, you know. Show you about a bit. Hunting on the jolly old river. Motoring. The races. A bit of shooting perhaps. And some fishing. I have been fishing. There will be frocks to buy. Lots of shopping to do. You'll be a rare pippin, what. A downy bird. It will do no good. My father says: You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. And that's what I am. A sow's ear. Margaret. Michael. Michael. Come here. Michael. Poor Michael. Did she sit on you, Michael? Poor Michael. Oh dear. Oh dear. Michael. Are you hurting bad? She is sorry she is. Ain't you, Ant? I mean, 'Aunt'. Something will have to be done about that dog. I think he'll get over it. We must find a place for it in the stable. Jarvis. Take this dog away. No. Not Michael. You can't take Michael away from me. He was given to me by my father. Take it away, Jarvis. And never let it inside the house again. No you don't. If you don't want Michael inside your house you don't want me inside either. Peg. No. I'm not letting go of my dog. You don't understand about Michael. He is a house dog, not a watchdog. A pet dog, Michael is. Peg, let's not have an argument. - I'm not having an argument. I don't know these people ten minutes and they want to take my dog off me. She has a dog right in the house. And well he may look. I thought it was her knitting until it moved. If a dog is going to be a dog it should be made to look like one. You'd know Michael was a dog. But they don't like Michael. I can see that. And they don't like me neither. It's no use, Your Honour. I'll not be happy here. Let me go home to my father. - Your father wants you to stay here. Do you think so, Your Honour? - I know he does. You promised you would trust me. Yes, Your Honour. You get around me, you do. There is something in the way you look when you say the simplest things. Your eyes now. They talk more than your tongue. Then you will do as I ask? - Yes. But what are you asking? Let them fix up a nice bed for Michael in the stable. Won't that be alright? Well. I suppose my father wouldn't want me to be starting a fight the first day. Alright. I'll do it. But if Michael catches the pneumoni. Which I am told is very common around here. It will be your fault. And I'm not saying I won't sleep in the stables myself. It's alright. Peg understands. That's alright, my dear. Jarvis, take the dog. Be careful with Michael. He's a fine pet dog, he is. Hello everybody. A bit early, what? I hope you don't mind. - Of course not, Captain Brent. Ethel. It seems ages since I've seen you. Hello Brent. - Hello Gerry. Chris, you haven't met our little guest. Miss O'Connell. Captain Brent. I am pleased to meet you, Captain Brent. I trust our paths continue to cross. Hi, Alaric. How is the wife? She is well I think. She is at Biarritz. Oh. Good. - Are you married? Yes. Do you mind? Margaret, perhaps you had better let Ethel take you to your room. She might lend you one of her dresses to put on before the other guests arrive. But? Yes, ma'am. Your Honour. Excuse me. Couldn't I be going home to my father? Not rightly and fairly, Peg. Alright then. I'll stay. I'll be going to my room, Aunt. Of course. We'll excuse you. Jarvis. You won't be staying long away, will you? No longer than is positively necessary. I'll be that glad to see you again. Goodbye, Your Honour. Goodbye, Peg. This way, Miss. Come in. Well, Margaret. I was passing, and thought I heard you talking to someone. I was like saying my prayers. Margaret. What have you got there? - Nothing. But something moved. My feet are chattering. I am cold. Margaret. How dare you bring that dog in here. And why shouldn't I? He is my dog. My father gave him to me. I think the least said about your father the better. You'll not say a thing against my father. Or I'll wipe out the whole of the .. Chichester family. And that is my last word. Well. I've never been spoken to before like that in my life. Well. Maybe I was a bit hasty. I apologise, Aunt. Very well. We'll say no more about it. But that dog. We'll say no more about him neither. Or I'll take back my apology. Margaret. Please, Aunt. He's my only old friend in this strange place. Very well. We'll discuss this further in the morning. And I thought maybe she was coming to kiss me goodnight. She's not like my father, Michael. Look where Miss Margaret has hung her hat this time. I can't reach it. She's upset the entire household. Chichester Hall is not what it was. At least we have our wages paid since she came. Yes. Makes a blasted monkey out of me she does. Smith. - Beg pardon. I was thinking of the hippopotamus I saw at the zoo. Sure. It is so long since I've seen it on her. I am wondering. Do you think he'll be recognising me in all my fine clothes? Yes. Margaret. That isn't the dress I picked for you in the shop. No, Aunt. I picked this one out for myself. Ethel and me was wondering .. - Ethel and I. Yes. Both of us. We was wondering. With all my fine clothes. If His Honour Sir Gerald would be recognizing me when he came home. Yes. I am sure he will. There is a certain something about you that hasn't changed. I think I'll take that as a compliment. Why not? It will save hard feelings. And maybe a black eye. - Margaret. I am sorry, Aunt. There is a devil in me someplace. Every now and again he pops out. A black eye? I will not have such language used in my house. And that is something you got from your father? You'll be leaving my father out of this. - Be quiet. Ethel. I can't understand what makes you so impudent, Margaret. After all, I treat you like one of my own children. I've been like a mother to you. A lot you know about being a mother to anybody. My own father knows more about being a mother than you do. Mother, that girl will drive me mad. - Shush, Ethel. I want you to do something for me. What is it, mother? - Gerry is downstairs. He has come to see you. I want you to be nice to him. If you keep on putting him off you'll lose him. Mother. If he proposes I want you to accept him. Do you hear? Very well, mother. I say, Gerry is waiting for you. Yes. I know. What is the matter? What's happened? - Alaric. I want you to ask Margaret to marry you. Peg? Good heavens. She's an heiress. - I know. But .. But what? - Perhaps .. Perhaps she's not in love with me. - Nonsense. How can she be near you all this time and not be in love with you? I dare say you are right. Jarvis. Jarvis. I have some grand news for you. I am now a member of the firm. Gerry. How splendid. A junior partner in Forbes, Hemingway, Chapman .. And Markham. - Oh. Oh. What's the matter? How mean of them to put you way at the bottom. I have to work my way up. It seems years since I've seen you. How have things been going? Rather dull. - Dull with Peg here? No. She is never dull. I hope not. She is a darling. What is it? It's been too terrible. - What? It's awful to think we're dependent on her for the very food we eat. I am getting pretty sick of it. Are you as desperate as all that? I want to get away from here. I know a good way. - Tell me. I will do anything. Marry me. Gerry. I don't say it's so sudden. I've been planning it for years and years. What do you say? Yes. [ Whistling ] Gerry. Let's not tell anyone yet, shall we? I'd like to yell it from the housetops. - But please don't. Just as you say. I want to talk to mother now. Do you mind? - You're not leaving me? Just until tomorrow. Goodnight darling. Goodnight. It is .. It isn't. Would you know it was me? Know it was I? It's terribly hard to remember it's I when it's me all the time, Your Honour. Peg. I'm as proud of you as your father would be if he could see you now. That is good hearing. You and my father and Michael are all I've got in this world. Ethel told me how well you were doing but I never dreamed you'd be like this. I've never studied so many books in all my life. You can't raise the Irish on a lot of books. It's never been done. They'd die in your hands, they will. You've learned something that's not in any book, Peg. Well, herself. Mrs Chichester. Is learning me how to talk. I'm improving rapid, I am. And Ethel. Is giving me lessons in .. She calls it 'walking'. And Alaric. There's a rare lad. Go on. What about Alaric? I wish I could take him home and show him to my father. Alaric is teaching me how to ride a horse without being injured in .. But one place. So you're learning to ride. Then I'll see you at the hunt tomorrow. You don't home now, Your Honour? We meet rather early in the morning you know. It is always going someplace else you are. You're like a pendulum. - A what? First you're here and then you're there. Never stopping anywhere. Not always. Peg. I am going to tell you a secret. Something quite important has happened to me. I'll walk out with you. Your Honour. What is it that's lifting your heart to the stars night? Peg. I am going to .. Going to what? You act like you was struck by thunder and lightning. I am going. To be a member of a prominent firm of solicitors. Forbes, Hemingway, Chapman & Markham. That is fine. It's a lot of luck for them having you go in with them. And why your name ain't first I don't know. Ain't it a lovely car? Will you look at the gadgets on it. I never saw so many gadgets in my life. - And they're all quite necessary. I suppose you push that and pull this. And maybe Jarvis will come out from somewhere. It can sing and play the fiddle. That is the radio. - Music while you're riding? Fancy that now. Do you think I could drive a car, Your Honour? I don't know. - I've a rare knack with a donkey. Where do you touch off the sky rocket that makes it go? Step on that. - On that? Like that? Well. I am glad that is over. Anyway, I learned how to stop it. How do I make it go again, Your Honour? Maybe you have to walk. In my new dress? No. I mean. I will walk. It's sorry, I am. - That's alright. I thought you'd leave me here to catch my death in the morning. I never leave young ladies in the middle of duck ponds. Mothers have learned that and invariably trust their daughters to me. Come on. I was afraid you could be trusted, Your Honour. Where to, my lady? I'd like to go to the moon. And maybe back again after a while. I'm afraid your feet are wet. - No, no. Just damp. Wait a minute while I catch my breath. Am I holding you too tightly? - No. But you might try it. You seem to have a grand way of holding a person. You must have had lots of practice. No. It just comes natural. Here we are. Thankee. - You're quite welcome. Your Honour. Here's Michael. Hello Michael. Your Honour. Were you ever in love? I am in love right now. You are? - Uhuh. I'm told that in England. A man is very slow about telling a girl he loves her. I think this girl has known about it for a long time. Now, in Ireland. A lad would be telling her the minute he found it out. Wouldn't he, Michael? He'd be telling everybody. And why not? In my case I promised I wouldn't. - You promised? Whose affair is it I am asking? Except yours and .. And hers. I wouldn't make my own father a silly promise like that. Anyway, I did promise. I'll not be telling a soul, Your Honour. - I know. I have said too much already. You won't mention it to anyone? Sure. I will guard it deep in my heart, Your Honour. And tell Mrs Chichester .. I'll have my car hauled out of her pond in the morning. Are you saying goodnight here? Yes. Otherwise I'd be messing up the house. Goodnight. Peg dear. 'Goodnight, Peg dear'. It's the same I'm hoping he'll be telling me. When everybody else is saying: She is dead. Margaret, I want you to be my .. Margaret. Margaret, will you be my .. - Yes, what? I say, Margaret. Dash it all. I mean to say. Dash it. That will do, Jarvis. Oh Jarvis. The hunt tomorrow. Don't forget to rap me up at six. - Yes, sir. Rap you up at six. Me too, Jarvis. Rap me up and .. Send me home. I say, Margaret. You're feeling a bit of alright? Positively ripping, old thing. Right. It makes it easier for me. Easier, you are saying? - Yes, Margaret. There's something I jolly well had to talk to you about for some time. Yes? What did you want to talk about? Well, the general subject was love. Jolly old passion and that sort of rot. It makes the world go round. - So does whiskey. My father says. But. Seriously, Margaret. Do you know something of love? Yes. Perhaps I know more about it than anybody else in this house this night. It's a feeling that makes you miserable one minute and wildly happy the next. It brings sorrow to you sometimes. But it's also the only thing that puts wings on the heart of you. I can't say I ever felt those symptoms exactly. I presume it attacks different people in different ways. In my case, it makes me a little silly, I think. Makes you? Any other symptoms? Yes. I feel I'm going to do something I've never done before in my life. Something useful? No. No. I'm going to ask a very charming young lady to marry me. Are you sure you have the courage to do it? If I haven't, I've jolly well wasted a bottle of brandy. Then I'll not be keeping you. If you aim to pop the question to some Colleen tonight you'd best get at it. Right you are. I will. Who do you think it is? I don't know. - Guess. I couldn't possibly guess who'd marry you, Alaric. Who would it be? - That's the question. Who? Who? - Who? Who? I am asking you. Not playing 'hoot owl'. Who is it? You. I say, Margaret. I had no intention of making you cry. I'm not crying, Alaric. I'm laughing. I suppose that's a good sign. I heard that girls always cry when they're proposed to. I shouldn't have laughed, Alaric. You are very sweet. And laughter isn't dead in you as it is in everybody else in this house. Of course, I've not much to offer you except my career. Your what? My career. I haven't started on it yet. But all I need is an incentive. You'd be my jolly incentive, Margaret. - Alaric dear. I'm flattered tremendous but .. Of course, Margaret. There's just one thing. When we're married, you must give up Michael. Give up my dog? What would I have to take his place? - You would have me. I'll keep my dog. - What? You mean to say you refuse me? Yes. I refuse you. - You mean that? I mean that. - Positively? Positively. - Margaret. You're a brick. A what? - An A1, first-shot brick. But I refused you. - I know. Some girls in your position would have jumped at me you refused me. Margaret, I'll never forget you have done for me. Never, never. Mater, mater. Peg refused me. Do you hear, mater? Peg actually refused me. Why? A silly question. I wanted to see you. That's all. Don't you want to see me? That depends on what you have to tell me. I pleaded with her but she refused to give me a divorce. That is that. - It needn't be. What then? We've managed rather well before. That's what you think. I'm afraid I've loved you awfully, Chris. I've given you plenty of chances to prove you love me more than her money. It is sordid. Darling, we must be practical. I intend to be. If you let go of my reins. Thank you. Goodbye, Chris. I say, Margaret. How about singing us a little Irish ditty? You've rung up the wrong number. My father says I have a fine voice .. for dancing. Give us a little dance then. Why not? You have feathers in your feet. It's a grand combination we'd make then. What with you having them in your head. Come along. Give us a hand. I know a jolly little place for dancing. We'll be back by candlelight. A hunting we will go. A hunting we will go. A hunting we will go. Oh. Charlie is my darling. My darling, my darling. Charlie is my darling. My father was Irish. My mother was English. And speaking of Irish people and things. Sweetheart, darling. Silence friends. A toast. Gentlemen riders, and all ladies fair. Today has been more than a hunt across the fields of our beloved county. For me, there has been a greater glory than the capture of every fox in Sussex. I'd like to propose a toast. To the young lady who's soon to become my wife. Miss Ethel Chichester. Congratulations. That is splendid. There's a light in your eyes. Sweetheart darling. And it makes all the world fair and bright. Like the light in the sky. Sweetheart darling. When the morning steals out of the night. Father darling. Mrs Chichester is giving an engagement party tonight for Ethel and .. And Sir Gerald. After the wedding. I am coming home. And you and I. If you want me. Will. [ Door knocks ] Come in. Cheerio. Oh, it's you. - Hello shipmate. Top of the evening to you, Alaric. - Admiral says, all hands on deck. Tell her I'll be right down. My orders are to bring you. Dead or alive. Dead or alive, is it? Look me over and take your choice. As you are. - As I am. What talk you have, Alaric. I beg your pardon, Sir Gerald. There's an unkempt individual outside who wants to see you. What is his name? - He wouldn't say, sir. I asked him to call at your place in the morning. He said he's taking a train tonight. Send him away, Jarvis. No, dear. I had better see him. You say he's outside? - In the garden, sir. I'll be right out. - Very well, sir. I'll be right back, dear. Mr O'Connell. - Sir Gerald. How are you? I am well, sir. I thought it might be you, although I hardly expected to see you in England. After a manner of speaking. I am only passing through and .. I thought I would be greeting you. And maybe. Getting a sight of my Peg. Can I do that, sir, without breaking the condition of old .. Kingsnorth's will? What do you think? I think some way can be arranged. Mind you now. I didn't want her to see me, you understand. Alright. Come on. She is happy here. That's all I wanted to know before going away. Away? I'm thinking of going to America to settle down there. What for? It's not exactly easy to tell you what for, sir. The fact is. I can't fool Peg any longer about me coming to England. I was afraid that wouldn't work. The only way to keep her from coming home to find me. Is for me not to be there. She'll go to America after you. She'll not know I am there. She shall think I'm gone. Like. Danny Fogarty. That is too cruel. According to the will she's not to see me again anyway. But if I go out of her life entirely. She'll find her happiness again, and sooner. You can't tell Peg a thing like that. - You could, Sir Gerald. You're not serious, O'Connell. - I'm asking you to do it. I'll take the responsibility. I'll let you think it over for yourself. Where are you going now? There be a train to Liverpool this night. And a ship from there to America. On Thursday. This is much nicer than dancing. I always feel I'm wasting my time in a crowd on a ballroom floor. You'd be wasting your time with me, no matter what you were doing. I don't know. Here we are and there is a nice place to kiss. And there is a nice place for my fist if you try it. I like a girl with spirit. Chris. May I have a cigarette? Of course. I hope I'm not intruding. - Not at all. I know you saw us coming out. And I was expecting you any minute. Besides. My next dance is with Sir Gerald. Shall we dance? If you don't mind, Peg, I'd rather talk. So would I. It will not be long now until you'll be leaving on your honeymoon. Yes. Our plans are practically all settled. What with Ethel gone and yourself, Your Honour. This place will seem a bit dull. I'm thinking maybe I'll travel a bit myself. That's not a bad idea. Your income is ample for that sort of thing. You might take Mrs Chichester along with you. She can show you all the famous resorts. I will not be taking Mrs Chichester. But. When my father comes over from Ireland. I'll fix him up fine with that grand suit he's always been wanting. Him and me together. We'll set off for .. Timbuktu. You remember? That's the place we talked about going to the day you brought me here instead. You mean where the heathens wear the cast-off pantaloons of the Christians? The same. We'll take them my father's old suit. We'll have a grand time travelling, we will. I am afraid you couldn't go with your father, Peg. And why not? For one thing. By the terms of the will. You must stay with Mrs Chichester for three years to complete your education. I will not be taking Mrs Chichester to Timbuktu. I might send her. But I'm longing to see my father, I am. And if I can't travel with him. I'm going back to him in Ireland. That would break the will, Peg. - You think I care, Your Honour? I am going. - You mustn't. 'Mustn't', you're saying, Your Honour? I couldn't let you go, Peggy. And why? Because your father isn't there. He is here? Saints preserve us. And me wasting time talking. Where is my father? - No. He's not here, Peg. You are fooling me. He is not here. And he's not there? Where is my father? Out at sea. Out at sea? What day is this, Your Honour? - Tuesday. Then of course he's at sea. But he'll be coming back Friday morning or Thursday night with the catch. And I'll be waiting for him at the wharf. In my old dress. With the donkey cart. Peggy. Dear. What is it, Your Honour? Your father is at sea. But he's not coming back. You're meaning .. He has gone? That's what you've been trying to tell me? Ethel. What do you mean, walking into my room like this? You'll not do it, Ethel. - Not do what? Go with that no-good man like you're planning. What affair is it of yours? - I don't know. I've wondered about that myself. I ain't got time to think. I'm too busy stopping you. You can't stop me. I'd be no friend if I didn't try. - Get out of my way. Ethel, you'll be waking your mother. And then where would we be? I'm not accountable to her for my actions. Nor to you. But you are accountable to Sir Gerald. You passed your word to him, you have. Don't you love him? - Yes. In a way. But .. You'd never understand. - I do understand. Let me go. - No. I'll not let you do a thing that breaks His Honour's heart and your own too. You think he'll treat you better than the wife he promised to be true to? Out of my way. You'll be sorry. - Let me go. I'll not let you go. You'll be staying here. You little Irish .. Let me out. Get away from the door, Peg. Let me out! Come back here, Peg. Where is Captain Brent? - He's waiting at the inn, Miss. Go to him and tell him that .. I've changed my mind. I'll tell him myself. Peg. [ Door knocks ] Peg. Miss O'Connell to you. - Why are you here? I've come to talk to you. - Sorry. I can't. You must listen to me. I've been talking to Ethel but she won't pay attention to me. Don't let her do this. It will ruin her whole life. - I must ask you to go. There must be a glimmer of manhood in you. What right have you to come here? I was trying to appeal to his decency if he has any. Don't interfere. You contemptible .. - Ethel. You're out of your mind. You don't know what he's really like. He has eyes for every girl he sees. You're lying. - I'm not lying. He tried to make love to me a dozen times behind your back. That's not true. - It is true. He is nothing but .. A parlour snake. - Look here. Ethel, you're doing the wrong thing. What about his wife and child? - Ethel knows about it. That my wife won't give me a divorce. - Won't give you a divorce? You believe that, Ethel? - Of course I do. Do you believe that any woman would stay married to him? If she could get out of it. That's a lie on the face of it. I won't discuss it. - You must. You get out. - Let go of me. Ethel, there is somebody there. They can't see here. Get in there. Hurry up. [ Door knocks ] Hello Chris. - Hello Grace. Is this your husband, madam? - Yes. What do you want? - To see the young lady. What do you mean? - Don't be silly, Chris. There's a woman here. We saw her come in. She's probably in the bedroom. I'll look. Would you be meaning me? 'Young lady in bedroom'. 'In night attire'. We have sufficient evidence, madam. I've not seen you before. Who are you? - Don't answer. My name is Peg O'Connell. I'm not ashamed of it. Thank you. Goodnight, Chris. - What does all this mean? It means I have caught you. At last I can get a divorce. But Grace. You can't divorce me. Watch me. But Grace. Wait. Grace. Saints be praised. There are no parlour snakes in Ireland. Saint Patrick drove them out too. Thank goodness it's not in the paper. But it's all over the county. You mean the influenza? I say. I know a jolly good wheeze. We .. we opened the door and 'in-flew- Enza'. Don't be flippant, Alaric. No. I mean this scandal about Margaret. I can't say I believe everything I hear. But then, every cloud has a silver lining. What is the silver lining to this one? Five thousand pounds a year, mater. Alaric. You've started drinking already this morning. No, mater. No. But I say. It's a ripping idea. Thanks. Mother, don't be too hard on Peg. There might be an explanation. Explanation? Rubbish. And after all this disgrace, she leaves us here to starve. After the way we've treated her. We've treated her abominably. Morning everybody. - Hello Gerry. Morning, Gerry. What's the matter? The Chichester family has fallen flat on its .. Alaric. I was about to say proboscis. The Americans call it 'schnozzle'. Don't be vulgar. No, Gerry. It's Margaret again. Oh. I felt the news of her father's death .. - It's not that. You mean you haven't heard? Heard what? Margaret was found last night at the Black Boar Inn with a man. Christopher Brent. Come now. That's rather a tall story. You can't expect me to believe that. - I assure you that it is. Peg. Good morning. - Morning, Your Honour. Some breakfast? Yes. Good morning, Alaric. - Morning. Mrs Chichester. Coffee, Peg? Thank you, Your Honour. Peg. I want you to deny this .. Ugly rumour. If it would be comforting to Your Honour .. I wish I could. Margaret. - Don't. What's this I hear about you packing your bags? I am leaving. My dear girl, you can't do that. And why not? Everyone would suspect the worst. I don't care what people might say. They're not my people anyway. Mother. I must tell you something. Ethel. You can't tell her anything. Gerry, did you ever hear such impertinence? Mother, please. Now you see what I have to bear. For five thousand pounds a year. What is that? What's that you are saying? That mother gets five thousand pounds a year for your education. So, you got paid for abusing me. Sir Gerald. Will you be getting me a ticket back home? I say, Margaret. Do you think you'll be happy in Ireland? - Sure, I'll be happy. I'll be doing a little fishing if I like. I'll be planting potatoes in the garden. There's all sorts of work to be done that I'm knowing how to do. And there is people that I'm liking. Michael will be with me. Only one thing will be missing. But sure, the memory of him will be cheering. Peg. Yes, Your Honour? I lied to you, Peg. What are you meaning? There won't be anything missing. You can have your father. I don't understand you. I am that upset. What's that you're saying about my father? Your father is alive. He is going to America. Alive? Bur. You. You yourself told me that he was dead. I lied to you, Peg. Father is alive? In America? - Not yet. He sails from Liverpool today. He is sailing .. today. And me here. Oh, father. My father. I'm going to him. Michael. Michael. We're leaving. You lied to me. You tortured me for what? Because I wanted you to have your inheritance. Peg. Your money. Money. Money. All you care about. The lot of you, is money. Money can't buy happiness. At least, I never saw any of it around here. No-one was ever as happy as my father and myself in Ireland. And we had nothing but the mortgage over our heads. Aren't you glad, Margaret? Of course I am glad. But death ain't the greatest tragedy. It's finding out that someone that you've depended on .. Has failed you. That's what leaves your life empty. Peg, listen to me. - I'll not listen to you. The cruel thing you did. Telling me that the only one that loved me was gone. And you were the one that I trusted. And I believed you. You did that for money? I call you 'Your Honour'. But you have no honour. Peg, wait. Keep away from me. Let me go. You wished? There's your song, Peg. Be singing it for us. Wait. Peg is going to sing. It's a love light that is shining for someone. Sure, I am wondering just who it could be. What's the matter, Peg darling? Sweetheart darling. Sorry, father. I've forgotten the words. - Sure, it's no matter. You forgot the cake too. And that's more important. They baked it special for you. Come on, fiddler. Give us a tune. Blow out the candles first. Did you make a wish? It would be no use. The wish I'd make could never be. - And why not? There's a lot of power among the wee people of Ireland. If you wish your wish hard enough, you'll get it. Sure you will. Cut the cake, Peg. It's sad you are, Peg. Be coming outside with me a while? - For why, father? There's a bit of a new moon this night. You look at it over your left shoulder. - It would be no good. You'll be trying it. You always did as your father asked, didn't you? Yes, father. - See if you can do it now. Be sitting there at the bench. Keep your eyes closed. When I tell you, you can open them. And look over your left shoulder and make a wish. Now. I wish. I wish. Oh, Your Honour. - Peg. Are you real? Or just one of the shadows? No shadow. It is you. But. Ethel? It was all a mistake. I was hoping you'd be happy always. I wouldn't have been. Peg. I've been a fool. Have you, Your Honour? Well, it is never too late to mend. It's you I really love. Say that you love me. I've said it in my dreams. Over and over again. Peg. Say it now. Let me whisper it to you. There is a light in your eyes, sweetheart darling. Tell me, darling. It is shining for me. ..w-g..
