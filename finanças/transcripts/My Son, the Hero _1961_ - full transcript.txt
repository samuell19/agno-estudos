Martín! Martín! Martín! Martín! Martín. Martín. Martín. Either kill or die, you never got it. You couldn't. I knew it since I first saw you. What's your deal? Nothing, I'm just dancing. You're not dancing. I'm trying to get a girl, she's not yours. Go look somewhere else. Who invited you anyways? You are not the host. Go fuck your... Don't be stupid. Keep her if you want. We heard you're looking for a girl. Yes, yes, I am! Your little brother? Your son? Sorry ma'am, I'm not from here... I never dance. Yes, ma'am. There's no dad. No? No. I didn't see this coming, not even a hunch. You looked happy... the last time you would look that way. Always the same game. I brighten the lantern. I knew you were awake Still, I waked you and.... you know... At first, I was shy, so much light... You said our love... wasn't meant to be in the dark. You giggled when I closed my eyes... Then you giggled when I didn't close them anymore. What! Nothing. Keep branding them! You're shooting a man not a pig, you fool! Don't hunch, it's useless! This is the pose. Again. Stand straight, close your legs! Play dumb, look anywhere, then... that's right. Hey, Martin! Come here so you can watch. What a stubborn kid. Don't fool around. Where did you learn that? Don't you know you're wasting time playing? Killing is a serious thing. Let's go. Again. See it's easy, don't play me. - Hold it. - No. - Hold it! - No! Do as you're told! Like this! Damn it, just what I needed... Where are the kids? Who knows. Aren't they supposed to be with you? Aren't they supposed to play once in a while? Specially the toddler. You treat him badly. It's all about this gun. Why do I keep you here then? You don’t "keep" me, ma'am I need to hide for somewhere and I'm here because you pay me. Be patient with the kids, they're not... Unless the rumors are true. You need them trained fast so you can get even. Is that true? And what about God? What do you know about God! What does anyone around here know about God? Bring something to dry with, mother! Bring it but don't peek! - My socks and my jacket, mom. - Going. We're going to shine with this much cleaning. It's not like we're looking to get a girl. What do you mean? Why are we going then? Try it, I'll get you both dirty and they'll dump you. Shoot! The dust! I'm coming! Don't be rude Reynaldo! Open up, I'm getting dirty. Open up! What's up kid don't you know this is a mixer. Do you want me or her, sir. I'm Martin del Hierro. What a pretty name why don't you shove it up there? He doesn't look like a straight one but more like a bent one. Stay here. Be careful, don't leave. Follow me. I'm Reynaldo del Hierro. - Oh my! - Oh my! You're still a bud. Where are you from? Near by... but before Asunción. That's where we're from. What's your name again? You heard me. You're Reynaldo... I'm Jacinta. Jacinta... - Jacinta, what? - Jacinta Cardenas. You're so pretty, Jacinta Cardenas. We're leaving. No time for anything. Shame. There's a party here and Asuncion is far away. - What a shame. - Shame... Hey Reynaldo, you better watch out. Martín's in trouble. Pretty girl, one day I'll go to Asunción. One day when I have the time. Don't say that again, kid. I'll end you. Let's leave it here. Sorry for hitting you. What's with you? Don't be stupid. Come friend I'll get you a drink. - He's got a big mouth. - He's still young, don't bother. I was playing. You already hit him. Come friend. Come. Hey doll, where did you come from? Come! Let’s dance! Don Manuel, you're leaving? Yes, I just came to check out the cows. I have to go! What a pretty girl I don't know where she's from I forgot to ask... She was under my spell. Let’s leave. What did I say? You're still up? Pascual Velazco is at Realito. - Let’s go! - Shut up. How do you know? I just do. He hasn't been here in a while. - What are we waiting? - I'm not going. What? I was never okay with this. You made this up and he believed it. I was never okay with what you thought us. I knew this was the reason. Not at all! Not with you! He wasn't your father. That's not my fault! And if we think about it he was more of a father to me than him. He gave me his name. And you know me well. No, I don't. I just know I've waited years. Reynaldo, Mom, don't fight. I don't know what happened nor do I care. Stay if you want. I'm going to Realito for Velazco. Wait! That's all you know. I'll tell you something. I went back at the plains to look at my father. I told you, remember? He was sweating dead, but the sun made him sweat. I don't know how. Velazco was hiding. I was disgusted fearful even! If you had seen that useless sweat you wouldn't wish death upon anyone. You too son? Are you also afraid of going to Realito? Give me provisions I'm going. Reynaldo. Stay warm. Who's right? You know I do things how I feel like. But I need to know who's right. Who knows who's right. I mean, you're very just but you know me. I pity my mother. Me too. I hate Pascual against my will. Aren't we here for that? To kill him? I don't like disagreements between us, Reynaldo. Is Don Pascual Velazco at Realito? Jimenez told us he was here but a horse of ours got sick. He arrived yesterday. He hangs at the pub in the afternoon. You'll find him there. Friend, could you give us a beer please? Hold on. What if he leaves Realito? Then it wasn't meant to be. You know what he looks like... or did you forget? Or you don't want to remember? Calm down. Calm down... Maybe he left I'll check the dinner. Don Pascual Velazco, what a surprise! We're blessed to have you here. We're here to serve you just ask. You're a real man. How you doing, boy? What do you want? Do you own cattle? Have a drink. I'm Reynaldo del Hierro Son of Reynaldo del Hierro. You don't remember do you? Whatever happens, happens then. Don't get heated. What do you want? My father was a good man and you knew that. Bastard... That's it! I've paid my time living with a dirty conscience. I've lived like a dog for 15 years. Do you know what your father owed me? Damned life... Is this cowboy bothering you, Don Pascual? What's your deal? Want to kill me? It's not worth it. Leave before someone else does it. No one threatens Don Pascual Velazquez in front me! ♪ Two flying doves left ♪ ♪ their nest far behind. ♪ What took you so long? We had to take another route to hide our tracks. - It's done. - How was it? Martin will tell you. I was unarmed. Be glad that you've been avenged. I'm your mother! You may be repulsed but I'm your mother. Get it! You're so good at forgetting. The misery, life as a widow years working for both of you. Teaching you how a man deals unfinished business, by myself! Don't you think I'd like to run away? That man was the only thing I had and you pity his killer! Stop that, Pascual Velazco is dead. - Go away! - Don't be like that... He also risked himself. When we arrived that man wasn't anywhere... Don't be scared ma'am we don't work for the dead man. This way General, please come in. I look a bit unkempt I'll be in the office if you need anything. - Bring me a chair. - Yes, General. Who's Martin? I've been told it's you but that he's worse. Do you know who was alongside Pascual Velazco? The frontier's fastest gunman. From both sides of the river. Influential people hired him. Here's the thing. I don't want Fidencio Cruz alive. - Who's he? - That's none of your business. I don't want him around. If you become a politician you'll know why. We're not hit-men, General. Besides Fidencio Cruz hasn't bothered us. I've been told you're stubborn. But three days from now they'll take you to Reynosa's jury and it's five years each. I can make that ten, that's if you get there. I can convince the villagers and have you hanged here and that's as true as me being alive. - We're not gun men. - I don't care if you're good at something, do it. If not, you're worthless. - Give us a chance to think. - No, son. I need Fidencio Cruz dead. You are strangers to him and since I call the shots he'll be down soon. Let’s have a drink at my place. He arrives until three. He'll cross the river at Jacales he'll bring contraband. We got time. Come. I changed my mind, you stay here. You're stubborn and you'll make your brother doubtful. You stay. When Martin is done, he'll pick you up. Come son, you better try the mezcal I got at San Luis; you'll see double. Fidencio Cruz! Fidencio Cruz, I've come to kill you! I know who you are! Who's that, Don Fidencio? I don't know that voice. Perez Trujano sent me. Where are you going, wait! Wait, I said! We'll figure this out! - Those are Perez Trujano's hit-men. - Let's get them! They want you dead, not me. See you! You son of a... I'm Fidencio Cruz come out you son of a... You're my mom, that's why you don't judge me. It's nor good or bad, stop worrying. Don't think about that, it's not my fault. Leave that to the General. You have Fidel's people and the General's soldiers after you, oh my! What was Martin thinking when he got into this mess? Ask him, have I said anything? What about you? Just asking, don't get mad. Why do you leave? Because I'm stupid, that's why. I'll get going so he hurries. You're strong. Look after him. Yeah, but who'll look after those that cross him? Who's next? For the other drink. Reynaldo! - Yes, sir! - How is it looking, kid? Good, tomorrow we'll gather the rest. Very good. I'll be staying at the ranch you take care of everything. Get the cowboys, herd the cows, sell them, take the cash and come back. Don Refugio, why do you trust me? Am I making a mistake, kid? No, sir. Alright, let's go for a taco I'm getting hungry. Don't cheat! I'm tired now, kid. Hold on! Bring more ember. Now the left one. Come on. ♪ Two flying doves left their nest... ♪ What's going on? His brother killed him Don Refugio, just because he lost. Let's hang him! I vouch for him, I know him well, so do you. He's got nothing to do with this. Bring your brother, Reynaldo. I don't know how but find him. Bring him to me, if not, I'll kill you myself. Hurry! Go away kid, go. What do you mean just because? Well like that. Just because, I told you. I think it was because he got burned, but who knows. I think that Martin... it's not that he just doesn't know how to lose... I think... Well, I don't know. You'll know. And the other one? Who knows. But it's bad, I tell you. What were you doing there? Me? Nothing. Here and there as always. Why do I owe you $200? I'm not charging you but I did lose them. I would have lost them anyway. Some men... offered them to me if I took care Reynaldo and Martin. How? Kill them, what else. But how... my boys. You with your resentment. Me with this damned job. We raised them this way, remember? Not even toy guns should be given to kids. What a sad ranch. Take your money and leave. There are some rainless plains.... dry and hard like stones. When I look at them they remind me of you. He arrived yesterday, he's sleeping. It was that damned song again he doesn't remember a thing. It seems like it's trying to ruin him. He was worried about you. Come in. God is going to have to kill him. He is like a dog with rabies. I mean it even though I love him. He is haunted with guilt. Where are you going? I won't tell anyone. Done, I'll get you something. Work never ceases. This are the brothers Del Hierro, Don Goyo. - And? - Feel free to hire them but if they stay, I'll quit. You don't know they're trouble but I have seen them. Forget about it, Don Goyo. Is the north getting smaller or are people crueler. It's all "There's no job" Is it true what they say? Are you my bad luck charm? Don't try me, Martin! Don't try me. Good morning, is this Asunción? Yes, it is. Good morning, Jacinta. You arrived at the party on a tumbrel. Yeah, you called me a "bud". It's been a long time. Yes. You said you'll visit. Is there work here? Yes, there is! Talk to Manuel my brother. He's the boss. Come on, girl. - I told you he'll visit. - Wait until Manuel finds out! Try telling him! What a pretty girl. - Hey... - Let's find Manuel Is the ghost back, Don Manuel? Yes, next to the big tree. Tacho told me. Don't say! The plains are filled with them! He told me, he was on the frontier... Same old story you liar. - It's all done, Don Manuel. - All of them? Yes, all the cows are at the stable. What's going on? We saw some coyotes. Those damned coyotes. We got them, but they killed the pig. Want to see? The hell. Hierro, follow me.

What do you mean, ma'am? Look at this pig. You're a clown, and not a funny one! Don't get mad. Why don't you play deaf so I can talk with Jacinta. - Don't you see she likes me? - You wish. Am I right Jacinta? Don't bother, I already know the answer. - I can read your mind. - What am I thinking? You're thinking "I'm so glad Martin is here. I missed him he's so handsome." Do you know what I'm thinking? "Finally I saw Jacinta, doesn't matter if it’s just a moment at night. I've made excuses to see her." I looked for you at the trough. I wasn't there today. It gets dry when you aren't there. Liar. - I mean it. - Wait until her brother hears you! Take your hands off me! Who you think you are? Wait until Manuel sees you! Let him hear and watch. You're envious! Pure envy! Come here! Get off me! See you, Don Manuel. Stop talking to them, get it. Don't be so easy you'll get me in trouble! I can't work if I've got to keep an eye on you. These are tough people, thugs. Just trouble. It's for you safety, get it? Everything has its time. The right time. You too, so flirty with Martin! - I wasn't flirting, just laughing! - Same thing! Wait for Reynaldo. Isn't that what you want? Wait until he approaches. When will Manuel let anyone approach me. Sometimes I want to... I don't know. Good night. There's none. There's no job. I don't want a job. Alright. I want a cup of coffee I'm cold. If it's not much of a hassle. We're out. - Look Chinto... - Good night, Don Manuel. - Hey man, how's it been? - Just passing by. Same job? No coffee... no job. What did you expect? Wait. Don't take this as an insult. Leave. He used to be a menace am I right Manuel? Yeah, he was. Don't be scared. I was just watching you. I'll leave. I told you the trough gets dry without you. I mean it, Jacinta. I mean it. Why are you here? Leave. Can we talk tomorrow? - Don't be uptight... - Leave! What's going on, Jacinta? Are you dreaming? Please let’s talk. Don't be uptight, Jacinta. I'm waiting for another man, leave. Liar. Who? Go away, Martín. Mosquito. Until tomorrow. No, another man will approach me. He said so. Hold on, it's Reynaldo! You devil! Great job! Where you going? The market, we need things for tonight. You did such a good job with the steer. I've been waiting for you, waiting for you to tell me whatever that is that you haven't said. Remember? It's been almost three months. Yes. Please tell me, Reynaldo. Stop it, do not be like that, del Hierro, Her brother told me to look out for her. Go away! I'll tell you tonight. Stop it! What a fool. Tonight, Jacinta. What's going on? Give me some of this. Take it. Don Manuel. Yes... Pour me some. I don't want to make a scene. I was told he was the problem that's why he's at the bar. Go get your little brother and leave tonight. Now. Square their accounts and pay what's due. Leave. That's because I don't want a scene. Get it? - Don't threaten me... - What? nor scream at me. Calm down. It's not how it seems. Stay calm, we're leaving. I'll come back later deal with you, with honesty. You won't set foot on this ranch ever again - I'll come back later. - I'll make it clear... that's my little sister... Whoever messes with her, I'll kill him myself. You want some lemonade? Come here, don't go back. What's going on, man? What's going on, man? - Let's go, nothing good comes from here. - What? Nothing good comes from staying, let's go! We're mid dance, man. We're having fun. - Did you have a fight? - We're leaving just because. This is a nice ranch, besides where are we going? I think I'm falling for her. I've liked her for some time. You're just a player, we better leave. - I told you I like her, I can't leave. - What about me? It's been a long time, we can go back to mother now. - Besides I'm tired of this. - Reynaldo? What's going on? Why is he leaving? Stay here, don't move! I'll catch up. Don't take the road, go through the scrubland. I'll catch up. Don't get in trouble because I won't forgive you. I'm leaving behind important business. I want to stay more than you do. I'll see you there. Say "yes" Jacinta because I won't take "no" for an answer. Let's get your brother. We're leaving. - Reynaldo? - He left, he doesn't want to be here and I need to follow him. - He doesn't want- - Answer, Jacinta. Don't be so defiant, kid! Defiant? You're insulting me. Let's not talk, get your money and leave. Not only that these thugs are used to getting away with it. - that won’t happen here. - Shut up. I haven't talked, you've been insulting me. Why bother? If you ever need a hand, remember I'm hard working. Besides if to invite me to the party don't be uptight. Or hide your sister because I know how to party. I'm leaving, but first I'll take care of some business. Unless you object. Since when are you... Don't you dare! Jacinta! I'm taking her, you better stay here. Take her to the ranch, I'll see you there. - What happened? - I had no option. Look after her. What did you do? Did you do it again? I had no choice; it was just the foreman. Nothing bad happened. Hold on Reynaldo! Stop! Stop! Reynaldo! Are you here at your own will? I was going to have chat with you tonight. - Jacinta. - Yes, mother. I'm going to the trough, bring the jugs. Yes, mother. Stop overthinking, that's why you're in pain. We haven't talked yet. You may ask what type of woman am I why I'm here. I haven't said a thing. I'm not a bad mother. Am I? You can't imagine how I lived. My brother controlled me. Do you think I'm in the wrong for running away? Something good had to come from all this, even if my kids hate each other because of you. - You're clueless. - You're wrong. I'm with Martin because he approached first. I had no choice. I'm going to love him, even though I love Reynaldo. I'm going back, mother. How's it going? You want some? Only Zenón, remember. Promise it. He's at home. I don't want a mess, I don't want more deaths. Only Zenón. No worries, only Zenón. I want nothing from you, I just do this because because he's bad. He's all over me. You do it to live peacefully. I do it because... I don't even know why. Maybe that's why they hire me. I don't care about Zenón. I'm a good man, but I can't live like this. I want you to understand. I do. Go inside, play it cool. Hey. Pray for Zenón. Do you hear the storm? The gray clouds are all over the plain. Looks pretty. I hope it rains. Need help? Jacinta. Jacinta... Hey Reynaldo, Jacinta, mother! I'm home! I'm home. I brought a judge to get married. Will you consider your wife the most delicate part of you? Will you protect her with your own life? Martin del Hierro, do you take her as your wife? I do. Jacinta Cardenas, do you take him as your husband? I do. - You seem distracted, can't you see? - Get a bigger rock. This one is good, shoot it. What a silly girl, look at that! She's got real bad aim. - She can't guard the ranch. - The bullets take the wrong turn. Let's see who wins between you two. I've never seen him shoot. Get down, let's make a show. Deep down he's a clown. I haven't used one in a while. I'll lend you mine. Let's see who wins. Are you afraid of Martin? Take it, man. - Get your horse. - Sure. Go! You devil! What's with you? You look sad, angry... Who knows Tell me what going on. You never notice anything. I fell for Jacinta first. What? I fell for her first. Then more and more. She turned into a woman with you. And more and more. I'm mad that she's with you, that's what is going on. Reynaldo, you should have told me. You've got nothing. I wouldn't have gotten between you two. She would be better off with you. I can't wait for the baby to be born I'll have to take her somewhere else. I don't know where. They're after me again, they saw him at Jimenez. What a pain in the ass! Just like us remember. He is waiting for revenge. Feels like a curse fell on me, now that I'm happy. You think so? I did a lot of harm. A guy named Zenón. I didn't even get to look at his face. His wife and kids were there. I have caused a lot of pain. But don't be mad at me, I had no clue about Jacinta. Where are you going? I don't know yet. Jacinta needs to know why we're leaving. I mean "you" in singular, she stays here. I've looked after her before. Yeah. Go with Manuel Cardenas, it's the best option. Stay still Manuel Cardenas I come in peace. Still! You killer! That's why you asked me to show up alone? I just aim, I'm not killing you. Let’s talk... Don't talk to me! Shut up, I'm sparing your life! Let me finish! I'm here to tell you Jacinta is fine I'm not a player. The judge and the minister married us. We're having a kid soon. Everything is fine, I mean it. I don't want any trouble take this as a plea if you want. What's with the sudden decency you shameless thug? All right... Jacinta was still a kid. Hurry up and kill me, because I'll come get you. Go back where you came from. Hurry. Leave. Leave! ♪ Two flying doves left ♪ ♪ their nest far behind. ♪ ♪ They couldn't go back ♪ ♪ after their long flight ♪ Is someone there? Reynaldo del Hierro, is that you? Yes, sir. A man named Martin del Hierro hired me to tell you... - Can I get a cup of coffee? - What's the message? What did he say? You'll get some coffee later. Not much. Just that... he took the road to Fierro, towards Sandoval. He was tired. Worried. I didn't really catch what he said. He said he couldn't get out he was near by and if you could wait a few days. Sandoval was about... Let me think. He was about three or four leagues away. He was nervous. Was he heading there? Who knows. The road to Fierro... also goes to Bueyes... Mier... Camargo... who know where he's heading. Hold on. He was injured. It was his leg. He had it tied up with a bloody cloth. Go get your coffee. Did you talk to the man, mother? I wish I could stay. Martin is going to die. I'll never see him again. Where are you going son? Stay! You don't know yourself bad times will fall over us. All bad things will happen. It will crush you. Martin is a lost cause, my son, stay here. Who will forgive me if you die? You'll impress the local headquarters, Captain. He's a murderer that nobody can stand. Easy to say. - He'll die alone, he's got no one. - But he killed two of your men. But he's injured, he's weak. Shame we can't take care of that. It's an easy task. It will be fast, Captain. I know him. I'm risking a lot, and I'm not here to please people. I thought laid down the law. Don't fool yourself. You're looking for revenge. Am I wrong? Yes, Captain, and it's urgent. I misinterpreted you. First sergeant! Let’s free this land from these thugs that haunt it. - Am I right? - You are. Good morning, sir. Do you want match? No, I'm out of tobacco. It's empty. Have you seen a blond man pass by, injured leg. Ma! Have you seen someone pass by? Take this, I'm not hungry. Yes, I saw a droopy-eyed blond. He was injured. Tell the whole thing, Ma. Not long ago, some soldiers passed by. Thank you, have a nice day. Is it this way? It's that way. There's his mare. You, tell the others to surround him. You and I will go right to him. - You sure? - Yes Whatever you say, it's not my business. You, go there! And you go around the rocks! Manuel Cardenas, leave! Take those people away! - Who's that? - His brother. Manuel Cardenas, take those people away! Mind your business, he is a killer! He's my brother! Take everyone away or we all die here! We all die here! Let's go up, to his back! We need backup! We'll get him no matter what. Let's go! What does my baby look like? My kid. Tell me. Same as any other baby what do you expect? How is she? Jacinta. When I left, she was singing. I can't picture the baby. I want to return. You want to return so you can teach him how to kill. What else could you to teach him? What else are you good for besides hearing that damned song everywhere? Not even your name is good for him. Killing people... what else are we good for? Why do we go against our inescapable fate? The plain looks so empty. Here they come! They're back! Reynaldo, you fool, hurry! They're after us! You know... What the judge said about protecting my wife, Jacinta, even if I die. To protect her I had to die or something like that. Do you remember? Now, my baby, my son. You really think I'll teach my son how to kill? I didn't catch that earlier. I didn't catch that. When you left, was she singing? The judge was right. Who would have thought it? What a strange feeling. That damned empty road. So dark, so cold.
