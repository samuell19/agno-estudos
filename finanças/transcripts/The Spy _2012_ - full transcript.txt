1st CHANNEL RUSSIA T Studio THREE Nikita Michaіków THEATER FUND With financial support Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation shows: In April 1941, Nazi Germany took over Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, and Denmark were getting ready to attack the Soviet Union. According to reports from the Soviet grid espionage on the border are already grouped 72 divisions of the Wehrmacht. Unplanned war in Yugoslavia caused the dislocation of part of the German army. The attack on the USSR was postponed for the next few weeks. Fьhrer's plans were very sensitive to changes. Residence of Admiral Canaris 1941 year. The future of the German people is in danger. The main question is will we be able to finish fighting until the beginning of winter, to fulfill the tasks set. Destroy the main forces of the Red Army. Exit on the Arkhangelsk - Volga route. We must be like an avalanche which you can't stop. Whoever tries to stop us must wait for death. If we win, we will go further. From now on "Barbarossa" is becoming an even more risky operation. But I know what for we will allocate the time lost now. The attack must not only be strong, but also unexpected. Unexpected? But this is impossible, mein Fьhrer. Along the border with Russia, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, we deployed 5.5 million soldiers, thousands of planes and tanks. How can we surprise them? I do not know. You answer that question, Admiral. Abwehr was created to solve impossible tasks. Њwinia. Bloody narcissistic pig. I will give you a key "Asian" operation. There is nothing you can do about it.

And then that he falls into a euphoria. And he is completely incapable of lying. And don't forget to make it through three, maximum five minutes, open the patient. Of course, ask questions. When Germany will they attack the Soviet Union? The attack was designated as ... This is a state secret. I can't tell you. But I'll tell you. The war will start soon. You will not be prepared. Because I'm perfect I will perform the operation "Asian". Fьhrer brilliantly said: "The Asian believes that without him everything will break down, he knows what's going on. " Such people, great people they feel each other. The angler sees the fish from a distance. The apple falls ... a pair of shoes, Gog and Magog. Sodom and Gomorrah. When will the war start? Asian tells me: Tell me your idea about this. I've always been curious. What will my death look like? I'm not a killer. I am a living letter. From Fьhrer and the German people. Personally addressed to you. Can i start reading We're trying divide the earth between you. Germany and the Soviet Union, they signed a non-aggression pact. But we both don't give the meaning of this sheet. And I suggest that something is safer: personal agreement of two main leaders. No war until January 1, 1943. Guarantee it will be my and your word of honor. The word of honor is of course good but I would like specific evidence. If Germany wants to attack, he would be shot in the head. Fьhrer fully understands that the USSR is sticking to it only thanks to your will and your successes. In Germany, the will of Fьhrer is the most important. Okay. You have the answer. Your proposal will be accepted. Until January 1, 1943 No war. Everything! Asian to me: you will be sent to Berlin. My personal plane. I told him: There is no need. Go, captain. You've done your job amazingly. If the hair falls from his head, it will be your end. What? What ... There will be no war. Germany will not attack us. Let me ask you where does this information come from? Out of here. Truth? Of course I understand now. From here, go to the airport. Go to poviats, Przybaltian, West, Kiev, and Odessa. Scare them as you can. First ... the slightest provocation on our part, even if they are going to throw grenades towards the border, because I will dust. Secondly ... the commanders who are accused, give peace. And thirdly ... Comrade People's Commissar, two emergency lines from Moscow. From your secretariat and from st. Major Oktjabrski. Ј№cz! With who? With the secretariat. Przybałtysk Military District. June 20, 1941. Oktjabrski tell him that he failed. He doesn't value our command. I don't know how you but me, after winning fills the joy of life. Now you have to choose. Do you understand what I'm saying? By the way, I go to a person you know. Oh to this actress. Yes, she is a wonderful woman. What Asian he was talking about Comrade St. Majora. I do not understand. We'll get to this tomorrow. Comrade St. Majora, where book with codes?
