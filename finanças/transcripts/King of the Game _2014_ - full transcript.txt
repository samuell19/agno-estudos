Man, you broke some ribs. - (laughs) I only used half a charge. - You knew they'd try to kill me? - What are you, a stupid motherfucker? I told you at the fucking truck stop that those bitches would try to kill you. Either you were working for them in which case they'd kill you later, or you were just a patsy in which case they'd kill you sooner. Anything for a thrill. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm just some guy. Some guy whose life was fucking ruined by those whores! Destroyed for their amusement, for the fun of it! Who am I? I'm nobody. I need your help. - (laughing) I don't have enough bread to help you, man. - Bread? You can't buy your way out of this. - What do you want? - I watch them bitches. They took your woman, you know? - My wife? - The new meat. - Took her where? - Nasty little place. Local yokels only. "The Cumme Buquet."

She wanted it. - You didn't give it to her. - I'm here on business. - You ain't some dumbass. You're the real deal. Those bitches got you down? Then only God will let you up. If God is on your side, you can't let him down. Now you want to do the right thing thinking other people want to do the right thing. The right thing for killer bitches is to kill. They are whores and they are thieves. They are contract killers. That kid who wants it and makes it in a regular city joint with a fine pimp like yourself, ain't cut out to work at The Cumme Buquet. Your rules don't apply here in the real world. I can't save your ass every time. - I got away. - Because I called the cop on them.

Blowing, sucking, anal, bondage. - Oh really? - Japanese basket, fox in the hen house, M80, black cat-- - Move on, man. - You get in, we will search out our objectives, you get the girl and get out. - What about your sister? - I'll take care of that. - Okay. I get the girl and we meet outside. - If we make it. - I think that we -- - Shh! What was that? - I didn't-- - Quiet. (whisper) They are everywhere. What do you know about slavery? White slavery. They sell girls into sexual bondage. They turned my sister into a whore! Chained her to a fucking bed, man. I tried to forgive them ... I did. I want them to think about God and Jesus for once in their lives. (rap music) - Hey everybody! Welcome to the fucking Cumme Buquet! Mississippi's only full service auction/sex club.

(laughing) (vomiting) - They didn't want me. - You better off. - You know why they tried to kill you? - What the fuck you know about it? - You don't give people what they want. - Bullshit. - It's so simple. We have a real basic system; so basic. Drugs, money, sex 24/7. - What do you want? - I want sex. We're talking right now and we should be fucking. - Really? - I want to be the girl that all the guys wanted. - That's no life. - It's my life, it's what I want. Anyone I set my sights on gives it to me, or gets out of the way. - You got it all figured out. - Just my part. Sex, sex, sex, makes the world go round. Makes babies, keeps the population up. Seems like a natural thing. But you don't want to be part of it. You got to rub people's faces in it, but you rocking the boat. Making people look at themselves. Think about it. - I just want my wife. - So you rescued me? You a badass, you don't give a shit about anyone. Okay, but you quit playing. Quit taking care of business. But you don't go away. These stupid fuckers got feelings. You can't just go trashing everything they work for because you think you better now. You're in the life, but you're holding out, and it's fucking rude! I heard you got a kid killed. - Something like that. - He got what he wanted, don't you get that? - That kid got his brains blowed out. Still talking to me in the time it took for him to fall down. Then I thought, "Why not me?" - Yeah, why not? I'm going to ask you one more time to help a girl out. (dramatic music) I was going to be big in Mississippi. - Finally. (phone rings) Come on baby, pick up. (phone rings) - Drugs, money, sex 24/7. Drugs, money, sex 24/7! - Who the fuck is that? - We got a problem. - You've got to be fucking kidding me! (dramatic music) (splash) - So I guess we walking then, huh. ("Spin Doctor" by Dominique Guiot) - Hey! Fuck! Shit! Son of a bitch! - It's going to get messy. (suspenseful music) - Motherfucker should have done the job him-fucking-self. - The boss doesn't like to get his hands dirty. - Yeah, well he's giving us another chance to do it right this time, alright? We don't have to mess it up. Fucking douchebag. - We should do his ass for selling us fake dope. - Listen, we do the job right, double the cash, double the dope. Check over there. Check over there! I'm going to go upstairs. When he comes to check on his darling fucking wife ... - I know. Anything that moves, shoot it. I can fuck it later. - They ain't hurt you, baby. Baby, we're going to make it. The fuck! - You thinking about this pussy? Huh, bitch? I got this motherfucker! I got this motherfucker! I got this motherfucker! I got you! I'll blow your dick off, motherfucker. (clicking) - Come upstairs! We got your fucking wife up here! (glass shatters) (laughing) - Oh sweetie, this is so much better than sex. This is the business end of things! - You ain't nothing but talk. - Oh? (gunshots) (screaming) (groaning) Please kill me.

Please kill me. - Did you find your wife? - I'll find her. - What if she doesn't want to be found? - It's not up to her anymore. We got a reason to stay together. - You put a lot of faith in people. - I got faith in family. - My only family's my Uncle. - How do we get there? - This is my Uncle's house. He just bought it. You're going to need this for the baby and you. Thanks for everything. You're the best. - I never told you I had a baby on the way. - All that stuff I said, it's nothing personal. It's just, I work for the king of the strippers. You know that, right? - King of the strippers? - You don't know? It's just money. Money's the king. Hey Uncle, I brought you a package! (gunshots) (suspenseful music) (gunshots) - Next time you won't be so lucky, fuckface! - I trusted you like a brother! - You ain't family! Ain't nothing but family in my fucking organization! (gunshots) I trust you with my nephew and look what happened! (gunshots) - The fuck you mean your nephew? - The fucking kid! That was my fucking nephew, and you got his brains blowed off, and i'm going to blow your fucking brains off! (gunshots) - Just a "casualty of war," right? - That's right, motherfucker! We're at war now! I'm about to shoot you my motherfucking self! (clicking) - Baby, watch out! - Baby, you hurt? - I'm okay now, baby. - Here baby, shoot that motherfucker. - Thank God for you, baby. - (AK-47 fire) - Did you bring the key? - In the duffel bag. - Didn't I tell you? All money ain't good money. (clicking) You want your fucking money? Huh? You want your fucking money?! (gunshot) Your business is your business. I quit, motherfucker. - What did you do? I should put one in your ass! - I'm done with that pimp. Put one in his ass. - Pimp? Your pimp!? (gunshots) You better get to stepping, bitch! That's my husband! - You set me up. - You set you up. I'm out of here. - You should have just fucked that little bitch! - I'm taking penitentiary chances. Risking my life for our baby, and you out here giving it up? - What happened to the thug in you? You changed! You know the type of men I like! I had a good thing going! There's nothing you can't fuck up! At least tell me you got the money. You isn't so stupid. What the fuck am I supposed to do with this? - Suck it, bitch. - You don't have the money. I don't have the money. I don't have a fucking whip. I don't have a life! I had a good thing going. See this? Look at it! You will pay attention to me now, motherfucker! You will look at it, or I will shoot your sorry ass. You may not care about yours one damn bit, but I paid for this motherfucker right here. And i'll be goddamned if i'm going to let that expensive ass education go to waste! Nothing is going to hold me back. I ain't never had no chains on me, baby. I sure as hell ain't going to let you or nothing else stand in my way. Well? - You're not even pregnant. - Don't you walk away from me. Get your sorry fucking ass back here! Get back here! (dramatic music) (inaudible) ("King of the Strippers" by E Master C) - Strong and black. Way you like it. - Thank you, Dimitri. You know, you were right about everything. - I told you smart girl would get cash. - You win the bet. (phone rings) Excuse me for a moment. Sex, sex, sex, 24/7.
