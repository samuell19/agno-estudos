Good morning. Stop it. You have nothing to be grumpy about. Well... Thank you. I do have reasons to be worried. I haven't said a word about us to anyone from work. How about anyone not from work? You really have to chill about this. You work for me. Who cares about what people think? You not seeing this as a problem... ...makes it an even bigger problem. Sweet Jesus! Those are the ones you like. You have a rosary on the night table. Is it new? It belonged to my grandmother. Sure, whatever. It's a family Relic. Eat your muffin. Do you think Aaron seems a little off lately? I don't think he ever looked on. I understand why he's feeling so uncomfortable. Especially now that we are so close. He knew what this whole thing was about. Don't feel sorry for him. His feelings are little hurt. Who cares. This is bigger than him, bigger than any of us. If we succeed today I don't think it's gonna be okay with the results. When we succeed today. Making history is troubling. Talk to Elijah. He'll know what to do about his condition. Faith is not a condition. It's an it's an antivirus! All right, okay. I've already heard that speech. Look... Talk to Elijah. I already did. Right after we moved into the lab. He didn't seem to have... ...any problems with Aaron then. Talk to him again. He might seem to have a problem with him now. Anyway... Finish that and go. You kicking me out already? We're not gonna walk in the lab holding hands. One can only dream. You want to run it again? No need. We can do it. I know we can but... ...it wouldn't make any difference. You don't know that. We've run it five times already. So run it a sixth and a seventh and an eighth. I believe it's time to accept the results. Fuck your results! That's out of line, Aaron! Fuck your results and fuck you all! I heard you the first time, Aaron! - I know how you feel. - The fuck you do. What makes you think I'm not feeling the same way? Cause you don't have any fucking faith... You just want to destroy everything... That's all you've been after since all this started. You're right. I don't have any faith. I don't believe in a higher power that supervises everything. How could you possibly know how I feel? I didn't destroy anything. I wanted answers. Like you, like everybody here. Some answer you found. The truth hurts. I know. Aaron... Get te fuck away from me. Our names will be next to Copernicus... ...and Galileo in the history books. Get the fuck away from me! No, no! Nobody move! Stop! He's bleeding. Everybody stay back. He needs an ambulance. Now. Call a fucking ambulance. Now! Are you sure you're not cold? What makes you think I would lie about that? Beats me... ...kind of like every other thing that you do. Closer to death every minute. No time for bullshit. Well... Thank you, Phil. You're welcome, Angelina. Hey Phil. Is she giving you a hard time? When is she not? Morning, mom. He keeps insisting I wear a sweater. I'm not cold. How many ways do I have to tell him? He's just trying to do his job. That's all. Annoying. Whatever... Thank you, Phil. You're welcome. What did you bring me? Don't blow it, all right? It was hard enough finding this place. This zoo you mean. Chocolate. I love chocolate. I know. So... How is your video thing going? Still like it? Yeah. Why wouldn't I? You are a news reporter... Should have an office job like I did. Better yet... Be a pretty face anchor. Less exposed. No, thank you. You certainly have the face for it. Look... There are two kinds of people in this world... The ones who like themselves and the ones that don't. You have to decide which one you're going to be... ...and I strongly recommend the former. What did you bring me today? Chocolates. Great... I love chocolate. I know, mom. This is it. Utilities are not included. I'll take. You haven't even seen the whole place yet. I'll take it. Okay... I'll... uh... need to check your credit score... I'll get back to you as soon as I do so. This will cover six months. Church collection box. I'll take the jacket too. Six months... That's it. How is he? Still in surgery. I sent a team to go and try to find him he shouldn't be too far. I want to go too. They're already out there. Who do you send? Katherine y Robert. Those pencil pushers? I can't send the cops now, can I? I know him. I can find him first. I'm sure you can. I told you he was going to be trouble... You could have done something about it. So this is my fault? That's what you're saying? That's not what I meant. Look, this isn't easy for any of us. That's why you have to let me go after him... I'm not saying I can predict his moves... ...but I've been working with you for five years... ...Got to know him pretty well. Use whatever means necessary. Whatever means necessary, do you understand? He cannot talk. He won't Stop! Please. Stop! Tell me, priest... Why did God make us? What's the meaning of life? What? The meaning of life. What is it? To love and serve God. To love and serve others. God put us on this earth to care for each other. Then why did he put us here in the first place? Aaron! Yes... Aaron. But... why? You don't have a clue, do you? Excuse me. Get back here! Get back in the house! Leave me alone! You're acting crazy! Fuck you! It's gonna bee alright, my sweet baby girl... - Get back in there! - Fuck you! Leah, my sweet baby girl. Don't touch her. Don't you touch her! Hey, this is Lance Abad... ...You know the 'beep' routine. Hey Lance. It's Daneen... I know you can't answer your phone right now... I just wanted to let you know that I... ...I didn't see this coming... ...I didn't see it. I should have but... I'm gonna find Aaron and make him pay for this. Next time I'd see you... I'd love to walk in the lab holding hands with you. Leah, you did a great job today. What's wrong? Did you see a ghost? Sorry... ...I thought that I saw somebody. You alright? Yeah. Anyway, I wanted to tell you that you did a great job today. Murder scene footage. Oh... yeah... Thank you. You've already told me that up there though. Actually I wanted to tell you that I'm having a dinner party at my place this Saturday. ...I mean just a few friends and some other work-related people. - Great... Have fun. A - MATT: I wanted you to come. If you want to, of course. No obligation. I have to go to Village Park. What's Village Park? It's a retirement home that mom's in. On Saturday night? Yeah... She's not doing well so I... ...have to go and take care of her. Okay then. Your loss. Thank you anyway. - See you tomorrow? - Yeah. Yes, of course. Hi. You've reached Aaron Swafford. Can't come to the phone right now... Please leave a message. Hey Aaron. It's Daneen again... There's only one way to make things right. Call me. Get back in the fucking house... No. No! - Get back in there! - Leave me alone! You're acting like a crazy woman! - Fuck you! - Leah... Leah, my sweet baby girl. Don't touch her! I didn't touch her! I didn't touch her! No chocolate today? Mom, your sugar level is through the roof. Fuck my sugar level. How is it possible that a number has power over me? The number doesn't have power over you... But your doctor should though. Fuck my doctor too. Beautiful, Mom! What's life without its pleasures? Coming from a presbyterian, apparently a nightmare. Exactly! And leave the church out of this. I've been trying for years but you won't let me. Where's all this bitterness coming from? What's wrong with Jesus all of a sudden? Nothing Mom. It was a joke. I go to church. When I have time. And apparently you don't want to. I did my best, you know? I gave you an education. I gave you Faith... Where would you be without your ethics? Okay, mom. I get it. I saw Dad. Where? In front of my building... Just for a split second. - Did you talk to him? - No... He disappeared. Does he still live in Roslyn? Don't you go and do anything stupid. Like what? Kill him? At least I would have the guts to do it. His wife is not yours to take. Are you kidding me? If anybody had the right to take his life it would be me. Not you. Not God. Me. I love you, Mom. I won't forget the chocolates tomorrow. Good. Good morning, Mike. Yes, the investigation continues... After this morning's NYPD press conference... ...the motives behind this vicious murder are still unclear... Father Charles was a pillar in his community... ...and a beloved leader in his congregation. A mass in his honor will take place this Sunday at Saint John's. Do you believe in coincidence? What do you mean? I saw my father yesterday... Right outside of our building. I haven't seen him in years... And then I guess I... I met this man on the subway... Met? He made me... feel something. What are you talking about? Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? I think that everything happens Period. Then we give it a reason that's relevant for us. Everything's a coincidence. Everything that happens before what you think is a coincidence... ...has led you to that particular moment. If nothing had happened before that had... ...the coincident would've never happened either. Therefore, everything's a coincidence. Holly shit. It's just random events that we all make especial for ourselves. Well, look at little Aristotle right next to me. We're self-center know-it-all primates... What can I say? What? I miss this... us. Matt. I wish we could do this more often. Let's go back to work. Yeah. Fuck, fuck, fuck... Come on. - DANEEN How is Lance? - Still in the ICU... I don't want to lie to you but it's not looking good. Aaron's gonna pay for this. I promise. I know. I want him to pay too. Any updates on the pencil pushers? No. How about you? I think I got something but it's too soon to tell yet. You got a lead? I'll let you know what it takes me... Call me if there's any change with Lance. - Daneen. - What? We ran it again. And? Same result. You did it, my friend. We all did it. No. We followed you. You did this. Get used to be known as the woman who killed god. God killer. It's got a nice ring to it, doesn't it? I guess it does. The Nobel Prize isn't going to be big enough for you, Doctor Belman. I'm afraid of the world that's coming... People are not... "We" are not ready to go on supervised... Anyway... None of this will matter if I can't stop Aaron. One thing at a time, Daneen... We don't have to do all at once. I have to go. I'll call you later. Don't turn... I said, don't turn. I have a gun. See that alley? Let's go. How about you, Father James? Do you know what the meaning of life is? How about you, Father James? Do you know what the meaning of life is? Do you even have a gun? On your knees. Now. Are you gonna kill me? Leah Thompson. Where is she? I don't know where she is. What time does she come to work? She doesn't come in to work every day. Where does she live? I don't know where she lives. Somewhere in Brooklyn, I think. Brooklyn is big. I just told you. I don't know! Shoosh! All right... Her mother. What about her? She's in a home. Where? Let me think... It's... Town Park. Brooklyn too? Village Park! Where is it? I don't know. I'm not sure. Think. I just told you. I don't know where it is. Just fucking Google it! Don't turn. Hey. You said that there's no... ...such thing as coincidence, right? That nothing happens for a reason? Well, guess what? What? Remember that guy from the subway? Yeah. I followed him. How did you find him? Check your phone. How about you, Father James? You know what the meaning of life is? Christ. How the name of God did you get this... I know how to find him. How? Do you know him? I don't know his name but... I know where he lives. You gotta call the cops. Not yet. Why not? What do you want to do? I want some air time tomorrow. And then we can call the cops. You out of your fucking mind? Is that a yes? Sure. You got it. Okay, great. I'll see you tomorrow. Leah. What? There's somebody looking for you. What do you mean somebody's looking for me? A woman. She stopped me in the middle of the street and... ...took me to an alley at gunpoint. Are you okay? She was asking me questions... ...about where you lived... She definitely knows where you work. Who is she? I don't know. I couldn't see her face. What did you tell her? Nothing. I don't even know where you live. Just be careful, okay? Yeah... I will. First it was Father Charles, last night Father James. The importance of this footage is not merely journalistic or informative... It goes beyond that... It's an attack on faith itself. Viewer discretion is advised. I need to talk to her. Who are you? Alone. She's all yours. It's nice out, right? Better out that in those torture chambers they have me in. You don't seem tortured. I met a lawyer once who said that the national sport of America... ...isn't baseball. It's litigation. That's bullshit... It's complaining. Do you live around here? I actually came to talk to you. To me? What business can you possibly have with me? I work with your daughter. Leah. At... at the firm? At the network but nice try. Just making sure. Leah actually brings me these chocolates every week. I keep telling her to bring more... ...cause they'll never last a week... ...but she says that's too much chocolate. There's no such a thing as too much chocolate. Exactly! Now she wants to bring me some sugar-free crap. This is so good. Yeah... Fuck yeah. I need to get me some of these. They make them in Brooklyn... Red Hook Treats... It's uh... It's a block from my daughter's apartment... You said you needed to talk to me. What about? Those chocolates. Leah always refuses to tell me where she gets them. Well... now you know. Thank you... for sharing that information with me. Sure. Gotta enjoy life while you can, darling. I sure will. Come and visit. You know where to find me. Hello? USPS. I believe it's time we accept the results. Fuck your results! What makes you think I'm not feeling the same way? Cause you don't have any fucking faith... ...you just want to destroy everything. Higher power that supervises everything... How could you possibly know how I feel? I want answers... - Some answer you found. - The truth hurts. I want to talk to you. About what? That. I'm not for hire. I wasn't gonna pay you anyway. I know what you're doing. You do? Sit down. Red Hook Treats. Hey. This is Leah Thompson. I buy chocolates from you pretty much every week. My mom loves them. Hey. Yes, of course. Leah. How can I help you today? I won't be able to just stop by. Could you send the over to my place? Sure. The usual? Yes, that'll be great. Awesome. When do you think it'll be ready? Give us like 25 minutes? Maybe 30. Tops. Cool. Thank you so much. Tell Angelina I say 'hi'. I sure will. Thank you. Have a good one. You too. Are you some sort of crazy atheist? Or is this some sort of heathen revenge or something? I'd say everybody is an atheist when it comes to other religions. So you are an atheist. I was a believer. But it turns out God is irrelevant. And hope is irrelevant. And anybody who tells you anything different... ...is utterly and irredeemably full of shit. But why kill them? Because nothing makes! But you're too stupid to understand that. Excuse me? You're even smart enough... ...to know how stupid you really are. Fuck you! You want me to bash your daddy's brains in... ...but you can't take a little shit? You're not ready for this. My father fits the profile. He's a pastor. He could be added to your list. What list? Your kill list. Cut the shit out. If you want him dead so bad why don't you kill him yourself? I don't have the balls. You should definitely not be saying that... ...to someone you're threatening with a knife. I was seven when he... My mother got us out of that house. But he followed us out. I thought he was gonna kill us... But my mother stabbed him. He fell on the ground. He was bleeding But he didn't die. That son of a bitch didn't die. Touching. All right| You either help me or I turn you to the cops. You know what happen to rats, right? Stop! I said stop! Killing that motherfucker will make no difference for you. It's not gonna change the world or anything. Wrong. The world is always changing. The ones who can't change it think it's always the same. Are you changing it? It's gonna change in ways you cannot possibly imagine. I think you give too much credit to those priests. Don't believe me. I don't care. I'll believe it when I see it. By then it'll be too late. You'll just know. Okay. I get it. You're crazy. I'll do it. What? I'll add him to my list. If we do this there's no going back. No hesitation. No cold feet. No bullshit. Tell me why I shouldn't just kill you right now instead of him. I just need to know that he's dead. Kill him first and then you can do whatever you want with me. If you want him dead so bad why don't you kill him yourself? I don't have the balls. You're not ready for this. Thank you, Phil. - Morning. - Morning. You look like shit! The bags under your eyes! Phil said he saw you on the news. Really? He told me you were talking about a murderer. Some guy who's killing priests or something. Yep... That's right. Killing priests. What is this? The Spanish Civil War all over again? This world has really lost its course. I've seen Dad. Yeah, you already told me this. - Did you...? - What? How could you? What? Who the fuck do you think you are? You've ruined everything! Angelina you have to calm down. - You disgust me! - Angelina... I told you not to do it. Not to do it! What kind of stupid cunt are you? Mom! Angelina... ...calm down. Hey, Frank. - Hey, Danny. - How are you doing? You want to go in? Don't worry. I'm not in a rush. You're not from New York, are you? No. Why? You said you're not in a rush. - You got me there. - And you accent? Where's that from? I'm a time traveler from the future. Israel? Sure. All right. All right. Load and clear, ma'am. You have a nice day. No knife today? Can I come in? No. Please. Thank you. Are you drunk? Not as much as I should be. You can't stay. What would make you think that I want to? You should go home. And you should show a little fucking empathy for a change. Did you know that the chemicals that make up... ...the human body are worth $3,000 in the market? That's it. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen... All that crap. Three thousand bucks. We're only what we have up here. And she's lost her mind. She is fucking senile. Do you know what that means? No, I don't know what that means. That means that my dear mother is worth only $3,000. Fucking Midtown rent at best. You know memories are what make us? They're priceless. What are you doing? It's rude to let me drink alone, dickhead. To me. What the hell. When was the last time that you had a good fuck? Your phone is off. It is? Sorry... I have a lot on my mind. I'm sorry, Leah. Your mother passed away early this morning. We came in to wake her up for her gym class... ...that's when we found her. It was... it was very peaceful. Thank you, Phil. You're always really great to her. She really deserved it. Yeah. Yeah, she did. You want these? They're her favorite. I know. Thanks. Any update, doc? All right... Thanks. Shit. He's killing his old teachers... Some sort of revenge against those who gave him Faith. First was father Charles and the Father James... We need to figure out who's going to be next. - Daneen, listen... - I have a lead... There is this reporter who filmed his second murder. I'm pretty sure sh'e going to try to make contact with him... ...or follow him or something. She's key to finding him. I'm at her apartment right now. Daneen, listen. I got bad news about Lance. He didn't make it. I'm sorry. We tried everything we could... I'm really, really sorry. Thank you for the update. I'll keep you posted if anything comes up. Just be careful out there, okay? I will. I'm ready. Why did you say that hope is irrelevant? Just trying to make conversation. I'm nervous. That's all. So keep it to yourself. They're charlatans. Con men. And they deserve to die because of it? It's not about them. It's about the damage they're causing. How is giving hope to people causing damage? Lies cause damage. When you spend your whole life believing something that's then proven to be false... ...you either ignore the evidence or you can do something about it. So you decided to do something about it. Look. I can prove with no margin of error... ...that there's no god, no eternity, no logic to our suffering. Nothing makes sense. It's that why you asked him what the meaning of life was? Some sort of sadistic final touch or something? I'm not enjoying this. Just has to be done. For the greater good. What are you doing? Just keep a lookout, okay? I thought you had a car. I have them all. There. Any security systems? An alarm. Maybe. Maybe? I think that's what we had... I was seven... I don't really remember. Well, it isn't much. Could've put a little more thought into this plan. I don't have a plan. Wonderful. Remember, no cold feet. Don't push it. If he's in the alarm's gonna be off. Does he live alone? New wife? Children? - No. - Guns? Probably. I think a handgun. Probably upstairs. Probably, probably. Okay. Go ring the doorbell. Me? Who's there? What do you want? It's me. Yeah... Me who? Your daughter. Leah. It's really you. My God, what are you doing here? Jesus Christ, you're a woman now. How long has it been? Wait! Wait! Not yet. Not a good idea. Please, don't. I just wanna know that you know why this is happening to you. Please, Leah, don't do this. Yo do know why this is happening, don't you? Everything I did was for you. - I did all for you. - Oh, you did? Your mother's got it all wrong. She's got it all wrong. What did she get wrong? She... She thought she saw us. Me. But it wasn't true. Just fucking admit it! Just fucking have the decency to admit it! I swear to God it wasn't true, Leah. I never touched you! I never laid a hand on you. If you never did anything... ...then why do I still feel you every single night? I loved you so much. I loved you so much. I still do, my sweet baby girl. Where to? What? Where do you want me to drop you off? At my place. Address? You ever hear from that woman? The one with the gun? No... Besides, I haven't been home in a couple of days. Where have you stayed? With a friend. A girlfriend. You should call the police. Yeah, I will. All of this has to mean something, right? Life has to mean something. I mean, we can't just be born and the work and then die. That's what most people do anyways. No. My mother saved me. That has to mean something. All my life I've been driven by this anger... ...and this desire for revenge. Now that I had it, I... ...I feel completely empty inside. You've lost your purpose. Your sense of direction. Yeah. I guess I have. I'm a fucking nomad now. The meaning of life is the one we give it ourselves. I'm sorry, Matt. It's all good. We don't choose to be loved. Otherwise we'd always choose better. Call the police about that woman. I said I will. Just let me worry about you, okay? Okay, but I'm fine. Sure. When you really are... ...you're not gonna miss any more of my Saturday night dinner parties. Please, stay. I have something that someone like you might find... ...interesting. I'm Dr. Daneen Bellman. Leah Thompson. But I feel that you already knew that. Are you a woman of faith? No. I don't think so. Good. That's gonna make things much easier. What if I tell you I can prove that God doesn't exist? Sure, but you can't. That's where you are wrong. I already have. - Scientifically? - Yes. - Mathematically? - Yes. Bullshit. You don't have to believe me. Good, cause I don't. Daneen Bellman. You're kind of a big deal. I am. And you served in the military. So there's no God or anything. Again, yes. Yeah, this is stupid. Stupind is not changing your mind when... ...you haven evidence that challenges your believes. I'm gonna need hard evidence if you want me to bring this to the network. I don't want you to go to the network. Then what do you want? I mean... Sorry. I really don't have time for this. Aaron was a member of my lab team. He's a man of the cloth. A man of faith. He's a priest? And a very dangerous one. Faith is an anti-virus. It's a firewall that protects us and makes us feel good. It tells you exactly what you want to hear. But it can also make you lose your mind. The brain intakes the truth as if it was a virus. Some people are immune, others get sick. People are not ready for the truth. The same way Aaron wasn't. So you want to find Aaron to make him stop spreading the truth. I just don't want anybody else to die. The truth will inevitably come to light. But first we need to prepare Humanity for it. But you know the truth. And if you say that the truth makes everyone insane, then... ...why aren't you crazy? What makes you think I'm not? Stay away from me. I don't have time for stalkers. I wanted to see you. What for? Can I use your bathroom? You know where it is. Okay. Now you need to leave. - Why? - Look... You wanted your father out of the picture. You got it. You wanted a good fuck. You got it. What more do you want from me? My father is dead. And I literally feel no relief at all. You're the only person that I can talk to about this. How is this my problem? Because you're a priest! I was at the park today and a woman came up to me... ...and said that you worked with her on some... sort of experiment or something? Okay, you need to leave now. Why? Because she could've followed you. She didn't. How the fuck do you know? Because she was still in the park bench when I left. And people on park benches can't get up and walk? - I don't know! - Look, you don't know... ...what's a stake here. I can't take any risks. You need to leave now. My life is literally falling apart... ...and I can't make much sense out of anything anymore. Well having a senseless life is ultimately... ...everybody's fate. Why should it be any different for you? My god you can be an asshole sometimes. I think that our paths have crossed for a reason. That's why you're just as ignorant as everybody else. No. You've made me feel things that nobody has before. Us meeting wasn't random. I know that you feel it too... ...because if you didn't feel it then... You would've left by now. I think that I'm stuck in your head as much as you're stuck in mine. And that's fucking you up. Love is pointless. It might be... but it's real. On the ground. I'm not armed. I said on the ground now. You gonna shoot me? I'm trying not to. I'm not gonna stop. I know. Don't follow me. Oh, my God! Come on. The world is always changing... It's gonna change in ways you cannot possibly imagen. Are you changing it? I can prove with no margin or error... It turns out that God is irrelevant... - Nothing makes sense! - I was a believer Where did he go? I don't know. Why didn't you go with him? You seem to need more help than he did. - What are you doing? - I'm calling 911. No. You need to go to a hospital! He's gonna vanish again. I need to fix this mess. What are you looking for? My gun. Are you gonna kill him? He took it. I want to report a man with a gun. I can't get you out of my fucking head. I can't get you out of my fucking head either. Don't you try to sell me that like it's a good thing. - But it is. - It's not! It is. It gives you a purpose. It gives you a reason to wake up in the morning. Go and live your life Leah. You still might find something to be grateful for. I'd trade all my tomorrows... for a single yesterday. Next one's on you. Thank you. You know, that's it. Everything happens for a reason. - Don't get me started. - No, no, no. That's what I choose to believe. Even if it's total bullshit. That's what I choose to believe. Fair enough. Now all you got to do is find that reason. Worth giving it a chance, don't you think? I'm sorry I ratted you out. I honestly don't know what I would do if I had a gun pointing at my head. You know you're going to be changing ghosts, don't you? Maybe. But I would trade all of my yesterdays... For the dream of a better tomorrow. So... Are you ready for a dinner party this Saturday? I might be.
