I don't even know where that is... - ... is a good thing... - And this manager, Gusyev... You know how it's like in our personnel department... No, I don't have a hotel room. And I came here as early as Friday. Then, on Monday I went to work... ... Well, what can one do? ... By the way... Knock it off! We're even. - I said, we're even! - So what? - We're off. - Where are you going? We're coming too. Grandpa! SCARECROW - Marina! - Hi, guys! - We'll be late for the birthday party! - No, we won't. - Here, meet... - Marina, they are waiting for us! Go then, I'll catch up with you. - This is my friend Sasha. - Sasha. We'll be on the square. I'm hungry. Don't worry, we'll eat enough at Somov's place. Too long to wait. We'll drop in at Valka's place, he'll fetch something for us. So, troublemaker, eager to stuff your face? So am I. The very thought of Somov's pies makes my mouth water. My grandma gave me nothing. She said it was no use in wasting food since I was going to a party. - Your grandma is sly. - She is indeed. But she still unravelled her life - neither house nor home. She's raised five children, and not a single one has given her a penny. Somov's got it good. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. His parents are rolling in it, he's a good-looking and he's got a good head. You're so envious, Valka. Aren't you? All people are envious, it's just that some people talk frankly about it, and others pretend not to be envious. Why should I envy? I can make anyone knuckle under. Strength is not the same as money. You can't buy bread and butter with it. - Ginger, what is the most important thing? - Strength. - See, we decided on strength. - Let me go! - You'll have to recognize strength. - Knock it off! Let me go! Knock it off already! - Come on, let me go! - No way. - Let me go! - No way. - Let me go! - Look, it's Shmakova! Shmakova! I can't believe it! In such trousers you should be carried. - Somov will be bowled over. - I don't give a toss about Somov. It doesn't look like it. What can I do if Somov likes only millionaires' granddaughters & ignores me. What millionaires? - The Bessoltsevs of course! - Them? You must be kidding! Why? What if those paintings he collects are valuable? Grandad, catch us! - Granda, ca... - I will! Grandad, catch us! Kids love Bessoltsev. He's grown poor. - He still buys paintings though. - He's a collector, after all. I read about it. Millionaires are always badly dressed. He's such a penny-pincher. He has no right! Paintings are people's property. Art belongs to the people. Million, you say. I'd like to have a million myself. - What do you need a million for? - What would you do with it? I don't know what to do without a million. But I'd definitely be better off with it, right Shmakova? Oh, knock it off! Life cannot be turned around... - Let's wait for Mironova. - Who does she think she is? I don't give a toss about Mironova. She's Button. She's nobody. So, Ginger... Guys, it's Mironova! Hi there! - The turncoat is coming. - Where? - Vasilyev, come here! Don't be afraid! - I'm not. Leave me alone! Turncoat! Will you go to Somov's place? - I won't. - Why? - I'm doing governmental work. - Cut the crap. - I'm sick of this your Somov. - Are you? Do you know what one gets for betrayal? Danger! It's Margarita! Hello! - We scared you? - What are you doing sneaking like that? Naturally, I was scared. Good gracious! Why are you all looking so smart? God! Shmakova, you look like a grown-up lady! - Do you like my suit? - I do. - Who made it for you? - My mother, of course. You just had to say that, didn't you? Maybe, it was sent to me from Moscow. It suits you. - Mironova, keep up! - I don't wear rags. Excuse us, Margarita Ivanovna, we're going to be late. - You're going to be late where? - To Somov's place. It's his fading. - His what? - His fading. Do you mean, his birthday? - Give my regards to him then. - We will. And one more thing, guys. Tell him that I wish him to always remain the way he is now. Are you leaving? I am. I want to show everything to my husband, he hasn't seen anything yet. - See you later, guys. - Goodbye, Margarita Ivanova. She still hasn't been to Polenovo with us. - Do you like her figure? - No. And jeans don't help her. You yokel. Jeans help everyone, it's just that hers are not brand ones. Where would she get money for them? She neither steals nor takes bribes. - Then she should start taking them. - Do you think teachers don't take bribes? - From who? From you maybe? - Why from me? From others. - Guys, it's Bessoltseva! - Where? Bessoltseva! - Hey, Scarecrow! - She doesn't hear. Guys! She's leaving. She's come for a ticket. Let's advice her to remember our lesson for her whole life. Bessoltseva, have you remembered our lesson for your whole life? She doesn't hear. Maybe she's deaf? Alright, she's leaving, isn't she? - That's enough for us. - Shut up! Ask us for forgiveness. - What a nice place! - In this city... Comrades, follow me, please. We will get to know the masterpieces of Russian architecture. This is the city's central square. Comrades, go to the buses, please. We will pause here for several minutes, after which we will go to the hotel where a dinner is waiting for us. Environs preserve many monuments which allow to trace primary paths of develoment of Russian architecture of XV-XVI centuries. Stop! Where are you going, Scarecrow? Under governmental protection, these monuments are a priceless treasury... You should be ashamed! Children, what are you doing? Children, how could you? Shame on you! She's a nice girl. What the hell? Quick, comrades, we're going to be late! Quick! Does it hurt? Wipe your face. Why did they do this to you? I'm a scarecrow. I'm ugly. I'm a traitor. - It's not true! - It is! It can't be true! Lena! Lena! I'm leaving, grandpa. Nonsense! Where are you going then? To mum. I'm not letting you go. Who said you're ugly? You're a pretty girl. Why are you lying, grandpa? You're very pretty. What do you know about it anyway? And when you grow up, you'll be a beauty. I can die ten times before growing up! I need it now! What's the matter? Grandpa, buy yourself a new coat. And don't shout at me. Firstly, I'm not shouting. And secondly, I might as well do so. I'm your grandfather. No one will ever shout at me again. - Let me go, I'm leaving! - No, you're not. You're not going anywhere. Get out of my way! Just wait, I'll take my belt... Patchman! Forgive me, grandpa. I always do the wrong thing. - Will you forgive me? - Don't even think about it. Well, have you forgiven me? I certainly haven't. I can see in your eyes that you have. Oh great! You almost broke your own grandfather's head. It's not true. I didn't throw it at you on purpose. Who told you you're a traitor? I just know it. Who did you betray? - You won't believe me anyway. - I certainly will. I betrayed you. Me? It must be a joke. You're inventing things. When did you betray me exaclty? Right away. Right away, grandpa. As soon as I moved here and came to the school. On the very first day. - Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello. - Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello. Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello. Guys, we've got a newbie! Come in, don't be afraid! Come in! We won't bite! - Hello. - Hello. Guys, she grins from ear to ear. I can also grin like that! I can do even better than that! - Who are your parents? - Guys, she's Patchman's granddaughter. Patchman? Why do you call him that way? What's wrong with that? They call me Skinny, he is Ginger and your grandfather is Patchman. - It sounds good. - It sure does. You know my grandfather well then? We sure do! He's a local celebrity! He's a big celebrity. Once, during a private conversation, I asked your grandfather why he didn't keep dogs. And he replied, "I don't keep dogs in order not to scare people." Great! You bet it is! We always remember his words when picking apples in his garden. He is kind. Yeah, right. My mother put patches on his coat. She told him, "You're an ex-officer, it doesn't befit you to wear patches." And he replied, "I don't have any extra money." Do you think he's stingy? He's not stingy, he payed my grandmother three hundred for a painting! She nearly died! And in the painting, there is an old bag with a piece of bread! It's Woman With a Round Loaf. Tell your grandfather that we all congratulate him, and that his granddaughter is exactly like him. Yes, me and my grandpa, we're birds of a feather. So what? I used to be called Noodle, I was very thin. I didn't understand then! I thought they were glad to meet me, but they mocked me! - Alright, what's next? - Next... Next I saw Dima... What Dima? Somov. - Hello. - Hello. I will be studying with you. You're a scarecrow! No, you're a scarecrow. Just a usual ginger scarecrow. Got it? Repeat! I got it! I got it! I'm a usual redheaded scarecrow! I give up! It's Margarita Ivanovna! Hello, Margarita Ivanovna! Hello, everyone! Look how big and bronzed you've become! I can hardly recognize you. - It seems we've got a newbie. - Yes. Wait a second, I'll find you a seat. Margarita Ivanovna, is it true that you are getting married? Yes, it is. I am getting married. Margarita Ivanovna, who's your husband? - A man. - Do you have his photo? - He lives in Moscow, doesn't he? - He does. Is he tall and handsome? He doesn't smoke or drink? Help yourselves, girls. - You needn't, Margarita Ivanovna. - Come on, help yourselves. Don't be shy. Take some. What about us? - What is all this noise after the bell? - We're helping ourselves to sweets. - During the lesson? - Help yourself, Mironova. - Hello, Margarita Ivanovna. - Hello. Thank you. Children, Mironova is right. Take your seats. Get off my seat. - What's your problem? - She's going to seat with Somov. Is that seat free? - It depends. - Can I sit with you? Shmakova! The newbie wants to take your seat, do you mind? Personally I don't mind. I like changing seats. So ciao cacao, Dima! What a scarecrow! Shmakova, come sit with me! From now on, Popik, you're my slave. Children, I have an annoucement to make. - Excuse me, can I talk to Somov? - Somov, it's for you! - Somov? What do you need him for? - We've got editorial board after classes. Editorial board? Come after classes then. Children! For autumn holidays we're all going to Moscow! Hurrah! Quiet. The board will provide buses. We will be living in a boarding school. And money for theatre and other entertainment you will take from your parents. Parents' money again? What do you suggest? He doesn't suggest anything. He's just showing off in front of the newbie. I do have a suggestion. Let's earn this money ourselves. - Exactly! - Margarita Ivanovna, let me speak! Go ahead. Grandpa told me a lot about your city. You're all such nice people. I support Somov's suggestion. Children, I like Somov's suggestion. But will you cope? Yes! Margarita Ivanovna! Margarita Ivanovna! Can we work in a labour unit? - You can. - Hurrah! First unit come here! Second unit come here! - Have you got wet? - Yeah. You're funny! Why are you wearing those shoes? - Why are you loafing about? - Bessoltseva's got wet. She should have put on high boots. - Just go. She'll be ready in a minute. - Why has she put on those shoes? What a scarecrow. Sit on it. Thank you. Put your shoes off. - You'll catch a cold. - Me? I'm hard as a rock. Take them. You really are a scarecrow. Just look at him! He's a knight! Girls, look - a knight! Oh my! Stop smooching! You've come here to work! How about popping the question then? Not a single sound in the garden Everything is paralysed till the morning Damn, I've torn my coat! Don't worry, I'll give you a rag and Somov will make a patch for you. Then you'll be exactly like your grandfather. They are birds of a feather. We're having a good time. Not working would be even better. - Scarecrow! - What? Look, she responds! Why don't you steal one of his paintings? We'll sell it. Then we won't have to work. Paintings? He will never get over it. He survived only because he started collecting them. Then we'll sell them back to him! That's no joke. He's a kind man, he's ready to give anything to people. He will even feel better without money. Right, Scarecrow? - That's true. He really is kind. - All poor people are kind. I read about it. Do you think I started beating them? On the contrary. I became ashamed of you. I even started hiding in the gateway when I saw you coming. Tell me, grandpa, maybe you noticed me hiding from you? No, I didn't. So you didn't. That means if you were a genuine beggar, hungry and in ragged clothes, I would abandon you. I'm a traitor. I told you I was traitor. Maybe, he did that because of me... because he was so... grandpa, he was... like in books. He was afraid of no one. He was always the first. He had such eyes. I always marvelled at what a hero he was. I always marvelled. Look, it's Valka. Bobik, Bobik! - Hi, guys. - Hello. Sharik! Come on! You heard? Hello, Valka! What a nice dog you have! But why is it shivering like that? - Is it ill? - It's just cold. Let it go! I said let it go! - Again? - Let it go! I warned you! Stop! The leash! I've lost my leash! I chickened out again. That's ok. Bravery will come. It's the third dog I'm taking away from him. He takes it to the knacker's yard for 1 rouble each. What do you mean to the knacker's yard? Just like that. To make soap out of them. - What do you mean to make soap? - How can I explain... I don't know very much myself. Dog's fat it used to make soap. This Valka is a jerk. He's a knacker. You're a hero, aren't you? - Why am I a hero? - You're afraid of no one. Well, it depends. Do you know why you are so smart? Why? Because you are very modest. That's why you are so wonderful. And that's true. - Are you in love with me? - I don't know. - And why are you asking? - Am I not allowed to ask? You are. Would you agree to be my friend? - Ok. - For the whole life? Ok. You must think I'm stupid. You're doing it again, aren't you? Petya! Petya! What now? Petya! Alright, I'm coming! Who do you love more, your father or your mother? He doesn't respect parents. He needs to be taught a lesson. And don't tell anyone about the dog. - Got it? - Let me go! Dima! Knackers! First salary for the labour unit! Hurrah! Margariters, well done! We're going to Moscow to buy presents! Somov, we can buy a tape recorder with this money, can't we? - We can. It's ours and hard-earned. - I wanted to go to Moscow anyway. We've earned it by ourselves, haven't we? ... with the force of 330 and 380 newtons. And two in the opposite direction with the force of 314... Hey you! There will be no Physics lesson! ... in the same direction... Quiet! - I said quiet! - Somov is about to speak! Quiet! We have a litterature lesson now. After the classes we're working at the kindergarden. - What work? - Those who don't want it, can bug off. - We'll do without them. - Work again! I'm not a cart horse to work for free. - Our country is rich enough. - Quiet! Guys, I'm going to surprise you now. - Do you know what our Valka does? - What? Valka, I've brought you your schoolbag. - Hello, my dear children. - Hello. And hello to you too. Excuse me, I'm smoking. - Of course, eavesdropping is bad. - Of course. But I heard your conversation, and I can understand your dilemma. It turns out, some of you are willing to work, while the majority of the class wants, so to say, mass entertainment. I think the minority should step aside. Such is the law of the group. As for this - don't pay attention to it. This is, as French say, no problem. That's it. You may be free. Free as birds. I'd love to chat with you, but I have no time. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And good luck. Dima Somov! Dima, maybe we should really go to the cinema? - We can't. - Why not? We will let Margarita down. Why are you bossing us around? Why are you bossing us around? You think you're the boss and we're your servants? - Guys, do you want to go to the cinema? - Of course, we do. Let's go then. What's the problem? - Let's go. - I have no money. - Me too. - I'll lend you some. I'll lend some to everyone who has none. Here's our legend. We are going to see a Physics teacher who's ill. Leave in pairs through the back door. - Take each other by the hand. - We're young volunteers! Mironova! - Why aren't you leaving? - I'm not going to the cinema. We can always use force. Shaggy, get down to work! Take the schoolbag. Keep away! Let go of me! Careful, or I'll drop her! Let go of me, dumb ass! Let go of me! I'll walk by myself. Quiet! Look. Dima's left his treasure box. It's heavy. What would you buy if this was your money? A motorbike and two helmets. Why two? Why haven't we gone to the cinema? Well, I haven't because I don't want to. And I did what you did. And why don't you want? Well, I like you. Why? Because. You'll understand when you grow up. Danger! It's Margarita. Stop! Stop! I left the piggy bank there. - You what? - Idiot, someone will nick it! I'll go fetch it! You're such a clumsy oaf! Alright, I'll go fetch it myself. Wait for me around the corner. It doesn't hurt. Go to the first-aid post. It doesn't hurt. Why aren't you answering me? Where's everyone? But Klavdia Vasilyevna is ill. So what? I wrote on the blackboard that there would be a literature lesson. Then someone wiped it off. Not someone, but you! - I don't like it when people lie! - Neither do I. Really? Then tell me. Where has everyone skipped off? Is that how you call it? You're saying nothing then. Coward! - So I am a coward? - Yes, you are. - You're a pathetic abject coward. - It's not fair, Margarita Ivanovna. I'm sorry, but it's not fair. Yes, guys knew that there would be a literature lesson. But they wiped off the text and went to the cinema. And I came up with the idea to say that we've gone to see the Physics teacher. - Thank you very much. - Margarita Ivanovna! Margarita Ivanovna! - Well done, Somov. - There will be trouble. Don't be afraid! We have nothing to do with it, we're here. Let's leave separately. At first, I thought Dima would tell them everything right away, but he didn't. Everyone was waiting for us near the cinema. And in the cinema, all I could think was Dima and Margarita. I thought he'd tell them everything after the cinema. But he didn't say anything later too. Then I thought, maybe he wanted to speak to me first? After all, I was his closest friend. I was so stupid! If only I'd told him at once that I knew everything, he'd have confessed! Because he wants to be loved, to be admired. He thought he was a hero. He didn't know then he was a coward. He didn't know then. I, too, didn't know then that I would become a traitor! How does that make you a traitor? It was him who did all this. Shut up! If you were in our class, you'd be even more scared! You're even afraid of dogs! I won't tell you anything any more! Then don't. Don't tell me. I don't want to hear all these silly things. What happened next? Did everything come to light? - Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello. - Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello. - Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. For deliberate disruption of a lesson, pupils of form 6-B are to have lower marks for behavior in the first term. The form mistress M.I.Kuzmina is to receive a warning. The incident is to be brought to the notice of the pupils' parents. The buses are about to leave! Quick! Take your seats! Why are you shouting at us like that? We're people and not working dogs. I told you to return to your seats. Quick! Take your seats! - Sod the seats, the buses are about to leave! - Take your seats! Bessoltseva, stop playing the fool! It won't help you. I wasn't playing the fool, I was just scared. - Take your seat. - Margarita Ivanovna, won't we be late? You won't, because you're not going anywhere. What do you mean we aren't? You have already had fun. For which you'll recieve a low mark for behaviour. Shmakova and me, we didn't go to the cinema. Sit and put your bag down. I know! You're just trying to scare us. Really? What makes you think so? - Why are you wearing a new dress then? - Because I am going to Moscow. It's you who are not. It's not fair, Margarita Ivanovna. The headmaster gave a warning to us and to you, and now you're going and we're not. - Vasilyev, do you really think so? - Yes. - Or maybe you're just pretending? - I'm not pretending. I had the right to go to Moscow much earlier. I put off my departure so that I could have an opportunity to give you several extra excellent marks in order to prove what an extraordinary class I have! And, by the way, someone in Moscow took offence at this. We don't need your extra excellent marks. So you should have left. - You should be ashamed of yourselves! - Why should we? - We didn't steal anything. - So are we going to Moscow or not? So maybe you let me down on purpose to... You disrupted the lesson on purpose just to let me down, didn't you? Yes. We did it on purpose. We don't want to go to Moscow. I have nothing to discuss with you. Margarita Ivanovna! What have we done? It's not fair, Margarita Ivanovna! And unfairness only makes children more cruel! This is what Sukhomlinsky and Makarenko would have told you. Just watch Test For Parents on TV, and you'll understand what you're doing! Sit down, Sukhomlinsky! You should have thought better! Who ratted about the cinema, morons? Who did it? Who was it? Marina, don't. - What? - I know what. I didn't say anything. Well, what? - What are you looking at? - I know what. Bug off. I know who is a traitor. Who? Tell us who it is. I'll give them 3 minutes to think. 1 minute is over. If they don't own up, they'll only make it harder on themselves. Own up, traitor! Well? Shaggy, stand by the door lest they run away. - Guys. - Well? Speak up, Dima. Wait a second. - You came back. - Bug off. You're idiots. I can't go to Moscow because of you. And you're the biggest one of all with your cinema. - Everyone wanted to go. - Stop it. Come to me by turn. I'll check your pulses. We'll see how the traitor's heart thumps. So you don't know who it is? I will. Maybe, someone else knows? Someone else doesn't know too. It's none of your business, Popik. Come to me by turns. Check. Stand in line. In line. I don't care if I'll grow up to be ugly or remain Scarecrow for all my life or die. The pulse is normal. Next. It's normal. Next. It's normal. Next. It's normal. Next. It's normal. Next. The pulse is at 100 bpm. - What should it be? - 70 bpm. It's him! He and Shmakova didn't go to the cinema! Alright, knock it off. Leave Popov in alone. Whether it's him or not, what's the difference? Margarita would've learnt about it anyway. It's no use looking for a scapegoat. It does make a difference. - Do you know what one gets for betrayal? - I'm very very scared. - Popov, own up. - I bet he has a lot to tell us. Only someone might not like it. Listen! I did it! I know, you're just kidding. How could you do it, you miserable Scarecrow? How? Just like that. I went to the first-aid post, remember? - Indeed. - Here you are then. I met Margarita and told her everything. That's how it all happened. Bessoltseva is to be boycotted. What does it mean? You'll learn soon. No one, I repeat, no one must talk to her. Let her feel our collective despise. We will declare the most severe boycott to anyone who will break the vow. Our watchword is "boycott traitors!" Guys, the buses are about to leave! I feel sorry for my class, they wanted to go so much. Just look at that, here comes Margarita with flowers! Bride. She's looking at us. Smile. Don't let her think that we're in despair. Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Why don't I spit on her head. Look, she's waving to us. Maybe, she wants us to congratulate her. She's waving like a mill. Guys, I know. She changed her mind. We are going. To Moscow! Reserve a seat for me! He wanted to tell me something important. If I hadn't laughed, he'd have undoubtedly told me. But I laughed, grandpa! I laughed, don't you understand? We had fun the last time too. Grandpa, won't I have fun ever again? Has my life ended? Hurrah! Stop the bus! Well? Now you understand? You understand what you've done? Don't worry about us, Margarita Ivanovna. - We declared a boycott to her. - What boycott? To who? What boycott? Margarita Ivanovna, there's a stain. From coffee? I know. The dress is ruined, nothing can be done here. I have more important business now. Bessoltseva, tell me, why have they declared a boycott to you? - We're just playing. - It's a kind of game. You have only yourselves to blame. It's only your fault. I warned you. It's you who spoilt your holidays. I'll deal with you when I come back. - Brown-nose. - Scarecrow. - Snitch. - Traitor! Wait! - We haven't sorted it out yet. - Yes, we have. And we firmly decided - no mercy. Wait! Bessoltseva! It was not you who did this! Stop lying! - Tell them you were joking. - Shut up. It's no joke, right Dima? You, Bessoltseva, should be burnt at stake. They used to burn people for things like that. What kind of boycott it is? It's not a boycott any more. - They are at one. - Quiet. Somov! Are you against boycotting Bessoltseva? He doesn't say anything, which means he is. - Then we'll boycott him too. - Me? From now on, Somov, you don't exist for us. - Great, Somov is out too. - You're against me as well. Of course, I am. I don't keep company with traitors. Boycott Somov! Boycott Somov! Boycott Somov! Boycott Somov! Boycott Somov! Boycott Somov! Boycott Somov! Damn, they got away! - Hello. - What is it? Hang on. They won't even let me drink tea in peace. When did you manage to tell Margarita everything? Me? Tell Margarita? Why are you laughing? Did you notice how she was torn today? She felt sorry for us and she also had to go to the wedding. She's nice, isn't she? Don't try to change the subject. When did you tell her everything? I didn't tell her anything. Am I not beautiful? - Who did you tell then? - No one. I've decided to become a beauty queen. Why did you tell everyone that you did? I just felt like doing it. I was standing by the door and heard everything when Margarita caught you. You did it for me? What are we going to do now? Do what you want. Why are you so scared? So you think I'm a coward? I don't think so. I don't think so, honestly. Let's go find everyone. I'll tell them. - There they are. - Where? Aunt Klava, don't give us away, we're playing a kind of game. Motya! It's certain. They are somewhere around here, I can smell them. - Marina, your mum's calling you. - Sod her. Isn't it them? Alright, I'm coming. What do you want? Why didn't you leave? - She didn't take us with her. - Why? Why do you care? I've already called your father in Moscow. What did he say? - He said he would be glad to see you. - Did you tell him I want to stay with him? What don't you like about living with your mother? Did you or did you not tell him? Just don't lie to me. What then, you want to leave your mother all alone? The sooner I leave, the sooner you'll find someone for yourself. You won't be alone. And stop smoking this shit. He sent me here temporarily. I can't live here! Maybe he'll take you himself, when he comes here. He won't come, he's got symposiums everyday. And stop whining! I won't go anywhere from you. And stop smoking, how many times do I have to tell you! It doesn't suit you! Nevermind. Motya! Motya! I'll show her! Motya! Motya! Guys, you're in the same class as Motya. Why didn't you go to Moscow? Well, you see, it just happened that we shirked a lesson. - You naughty shameless children. - Sorry. Goodbye. Grandpa, if I ask you a question, will you take it seriously? Go ahead. Promise? I promise. When you were 12, did you hug girls? Me? At 12? I must confess, I didn't. You see? And he hugged me. How? Like this. In front of everyone. We walked the street like that. And Sveta, his sister, she is so nasty. She started shouting, "Bride and groom!" And I asked, "Who?" And she replied, "Dima is the groom, and you're the bride." I liked it. It felt good that she should say so. Is it wrong? In some sense, it's even... - ... wonderful. - Really? Bride and groom! Bride and groom! What are you doing here? Go home now! Dima is the groom, and Lena is the bride! It's Sveta, my sister. She's cute. Listen. I decided to bring home the bag and go back to the hairdresser's. What for? I want a new hair-style. I'm tired of plaits. I'll accompany you. You know, it occurred to me that no one will believe me if I confess right away. They'll think I just want to help you out. It'll be better if I do it later, without you. What do you think? I think like you do. And what did he say? He was glad. He liked what I said. And you were glad that you helped him once again? Yes, I was! I was! I was! You told yourself that one must be merciful! - You said so! - Calm down. You did the right thing. I understand. No, you don't. Why not? You can't. Just don't tell anyone yet. Otherwise, it'll look as if I'm a coward. Ok? Alright. I'll tell them myself when I see them. I'll wait for you here then. - They're not here. - We'll find them, you'll see. It's a shame that there are only sissies in our class. They say they feel sorry for her. And tomorrow they'll kiss with the traitor. They don't care. What kind of class is this? They've all copped out! There's no friendship here. My poor feet. I got up at 5 today. I had everyone on their toes at home. Mum gave me a list of things to buy. I sponged some money from my father. He's very kind. When he's drunk, mum and me ask him for money. Just don't tell anyone. I told you privately, as a friend. - What were you going to buy in Moscow? - Nothing. - Listen, Mironova, why are you like that? - Like what? I saw your mum yesterday. She was in blue jacket to match the colour of her eyes. I was bowled over. You're miserable. Look how touchy you are. And what about you? We are normal, with no hang-ups. There's no war - it's already good. Is that what your mother says? Listen, Button... Iron Button. If you're so upright, then say what Scarecrow did to you. She honestly told the teacher everything. Honesty is a loose concept. One can say honestly but act basely. You know I didn't want to go to the cinema, buy I cannot betray either. If you betray a friend today, tomorrow you'll betray... Have you read the book "One becomes a traitor only once"? Read it. I don't like books about war. And what if it's not Bessoltseva? Then who? It doesn't matter. I treat everyone equally. If you don't live truthfully - there's payback. Otherwise... How about I beat you up now? What do you mean? I mean what I say. Like this. What are you staring at? Mum! We can't find them anywhere. Even at home. - And Shaggy caught Vasilyev. - What for? He stands up for Scarecrow. Let go of me! - I'm talking to you! - Oh come on. Stop pushing with your muscles! You'll break my neck! Are you stupid? So, turncoat, have nothing to say? Have you read the book "One becomes a traitor only once"? I'm against betrayal too! But you mustn't hit her! She's a girl! So what? A girl. Morons. Do you know that someone was waiting for me in Moscow? - For who? - For me. You're all used to living here, you don't care. And I had to be there. Just listen, someone was waiting for her! Stinking Moscovite. An orchestra and a 3-course meal were prepared for her. Who was waiting for you? - Someone. - Who? - My father. - Bullshitter. Why do you have your mother's surname then? - Shut up. - Knock it off you two. She's bullshitting. Everyone knows she doesn't have a father. Shut it already. Look who's talking. Don't stick your nose. I'll call you when I need you. - Hey, carefully! - Stop it, girls! Girls! Stop it already! Don't! Stop it! Stop it! Look! What is that? Ayvazovsky's painting Pioneers Collecting Scrap Metal. What a hair-style that is! Surround her. She pretends she doesn't care about us. Who is that beauty over there? She doesn't notice us. Lena, it's us, your classmates. Valka, fire! Taking aim. Outflank her. Surround her! What are you doing, hooligans? I'll take you to the police! Motya! Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you. Stop calling me like that! I'm not Motya. She's a jerk and you do her hair, stupid. What? You should be ashamed to talk to your mother like that in front of others. - Stop calling me stupid! - Bug off! Don't stick your nose in my business! What does it mean not to stick my nose in your business? Am I a stranger for you? I'm your mother, after all. It's just a kind of game. What are you doing? You'll spoil her hair-style! She grins from ear to ear. - What are you doing? - Let go of me! What are you doing? Hey! Dima! Dima! Don't hit girls! I'll call the police! Police! Parasites! You miserable scum! Your school should deal with you better! What is your Komsomol organization doing! We're on holidays. Life is impossible to turn around And time cannot be stopped not for a single moment And though the night is pitch-dark and my home is lonesome The old clock still goes Scarecrow is a traitor! Scarecrow is a traitor! Scarecrow is a traitor! Scarecrow is a traitor! Scarecrow is a traitor! Scarecrow is a traitor! Scarecrow... You have to behave as if it has nothing to do with you. If you run, it means you're guilty, doesn't it? I understood that you mustn't run. You mustn't run when you're chased. You mustn't run even if there are a lot of them! Even if they hit you, you must never run! Never! In any case, you must never run! Vasilyev! Vasilyev! - And where's everyone else? - You know where. They're chasing Bessoltseva. - It means I'm late. - What do you need them for? I have to talk to them. Dima, will you help her? They hit her. What kind of boycott that is? - And what else? - It's not a boycott any more. Stop whining! I'm sick as it is. Crybaby. Sissy. Coward. - I'm a coward? - You are! - Coward, coward! - Sod you all! She's not a traitor! - You like her, don't you? - What? Why? - But you do believe her? - I do. And you? - Maybe she'd better leave? - How? For good. Talk to her. Or else, they'll make her life miserable. While we're standing here talking, they are beating her. Let's go! Grandpa! Scarecrow! Scarecrow, come out! Scarecrow! Scarecrow! Patchgirl! Dima! Did he tell them? Did he? Did he tell them that it wasn't you? Stop weeping. Or else, I might think that he chickened out again. It's impossible. It's impossible. It's too much. This your Dima... - Stop it! - I'm saying that... Stop it! I'll make tea for you. I'll make tea for you. Don't cry. You know, tea will help you a lot. Why, grandpa? Why? I don't want to live. I don't want to live! Don't say that. Tell me what happened next. Well? Tell me. 2-23-19... Hello. Sveta, is Dima at home? What? What was that again? I've had my hair styled. Yes. Aunt Klava said I look stunning. Yes. Mum! Guess what I've brought you. Quiet. Why have you turned off the light? There's a wild boar. What boar? Where? I'm telling you, there's some man who put on a boar's head and tried to climb through the window. Hey! There's no one here. One starts seeing all kinds of things in the dark. And you got scared. Silly you. By the way, you're a daughter of a major who's been through the war. You're afraid of other people's dogs yourself. Who is not afraid of other people's dogs? Just look here. Fortune smiled on us. Kolkin's grandmother presented us with this painting. Here it is. I wanted to give her money, but she won't take it. So nice and kind and wonderful Kolkin's grandmother is. Just look at that! Wonderful Kolkin's grandmother. What unique people surround us. Lena! Lena, wake up! Look! Do you like it? It's just a girl who looks a bit like me. What happened to your plaits? I've had my hair styled. It's just for holidays. But... You haven't cut them off, have you? No. Aunt Klava just made it curly. How lucky it is that you've done your hair! Otherwise, I'd never notice how alike you look! The same eyes. The same lips. And if you were bald, you'd be an exact double. Do you know who this is? Do you know... where is it... Do you know who this is? Who? Here's a medallion. It's grandma Masha. Masha, my grandfather's sister. She died when I was 4. They were serfs of Razumovsky's. Your school is his former estate. In order to build it, he sold entire village of the Bessoltsevs: my grandfather, my grandmother and even the famous Petr, the artist, whose paintings we collect. They were later bought out. Grandma Masha got education and became a teacher. She was a nurse during the siege of Sevastopol. Have you read Sevastopol Stories by Tolstoy? She was there. And my grandfather became a doctor. He built the first hospital in the city. He also built a children's home. In 1941 Fascists killed him. It happened right here, in the yard, by this very window. He was hiding the wounded. He was 81. Everything is so close. Come to think of it, serfdom was not that long ago. Grandpa, there's a boar! - Here's your boar. - Dima! Grandpa, they are holding him by force. They make him scare me. Grandpa, they tied his hands. Grandpa, shout at them! Dima! Why doesn't he answer you? You don't know them. They could have put a rag in this mouth. Grandpa, shout! Save him! Hey! Let Dima go! He might choke there. He's got a rag in his mouth. Lena! I already know what happened next. - What do you know? - I know everything. He chickened out again. No one was holding him. No one gagged him. You invented all this. You did! - What did I do? - Let's drink tea. - What happened next? - I won't say anything. - Lena! - I won't say a word. So you approached the house and stood by the window. No, I looked through the window. And? They sat there drinking tea. They were talking, laughing, watching TV. I wouldn't have taken it. I wouldn't have taken it. - What would have you done? - What would have I done? I would have taken a stone and thrown it in the window. I wouldn't have taken it. Neither did I. I took a stone and threw it in the window. - It's hooliganism. - Yes. - And the window shattered? - Into small pieces. We have to pay for it. Don't pay them. Let them prove it was me. Grandpa. I don't love anyone. Anyone. I decided to forget him. That's the right thing to do. I have pride too. That's right. The next day, I decided to start a new life. I hate him. I hate him. I'll show him. He'll write letters to me, but I won't answer them. Even if there are 10 letters. Even if there are 100 of them, I won't answer. No way. Do you know who I am? I do recognize you, you're Dima Somov, aren't you? If only you knew who I really am, you wouldn't be joking. Who are you then? I am the most abject coward. You? A coward? You're not a coward at all. You took dogs from Valka. You weren't even afraid of Petya. You told the truth to Margarita. No. I confessed to Margarita to prove to myself that I wasn't a coward. And I'm not afraid to get into a fight. But I can't tell everything to everyone. But I will tell them everything today, right now. - Do you believe me? - I do. - You do believe me? - Of course, I do. Give the dress back! It's so funny. I told you to give back the dress! You'll get the dress back when you bring the boar's head. We'll meet again. Sod you. Now I got you. Don't worry, I'll get the dress back and tell everyone. Dima, wait! Dima! Take it. Wait for me. Dima! Dima! I'm Scarecrow. You really are a scarecrow. I'm Lena Bessoltseva. I'm Scarecrow. Take off the dress. Somov, where were you just now? Why aren't you saying anything? Guys, Somov was at Scarecrow's place. And guess what they were doing there. They were kissing. Kissing? With Bessoltseva? Bullcrap. Traitor! I am a traitor? You miserable knacker. Guys, do you know what our Valka does? I said shut it! Take that! Want more? - Try this! - Put away that stick! - Stop it! - Put away the stick! You really are heroes hiding behind a girl's back. - Somov, were you with Bessoltseva? - I was. You felt sorry for her? Supposing I did. Sissy. - And what if... - What? - What if it wasn't her? - Then who? What if it was me? You? It's getting interesting. Why not? It's quite possible. And this oaf Bessoltseva covered him up. Is that what happened? Look into my eyes. Into my eyes. I can't even joke now? You don't understand jokes. It was a joke. A joke then? What kind of joke that is? What are you doing? I just wanted to help Bessoltseva! I felt sorry for her! Look, it's Scarecrow. Scarecrow's come by herself. - I have. - Are you scared? I'm not. I couldn't wait for you any longer. That's why I've come. It seems to me, it means they are friends. Let's arrange a confrontation for them. It's so gripping. Bessoltseva, so who's the traitor? Is it you or Somov? Of course, it's me. She's repented. She has to ask for forgiveness. I thought so. So then, Bessoltseva, get down on your knees, maybe you'll move us too. Give me my dress back. Come on, take it! Come on! Here's your confrontation. Finally we'll get to know the truth. - Give it to me. - Come on, Somov! Give it to me. Hurrah! Seize her! Brazen girl! Quick. Here. Take it. Careful. - This is good. - Come on. Look. Scarecrow is a traitor. Somov, light it up! - I have no matches. - Bullshitter! Coward! Dima, don't! Somov, go ahead! Dima! Don't do it! Come on, step aside! Hurrah! Burn! Burn! It's her own fault. It's her own fault. It's only her fault. Mum! Don't get in there! She's nuts. What are you doing? You'll get burnt! Are you out of your mind? It's just a joke! Can't you take a joke? It was just a game! Everyone, go home! That's all, grandpa. By the way, it's Somov's birthday. Grandpa. What will you do here alone? Come with me. Mum and dad will be glad. I won't stay here, not a single day longer. Take your paintings and let's go. It's impossible. Don't you understand? They were born here. And they have to remain here. I will die without them. - Look, we've got a visitor. - Hello. Grandpa, it's Vasilyev. Hello. It wasn't locked. Have a seat, Vasilyev. Thank you. We're glad to see you. - Would you like some tea? - No, thank you. How do you like our paintings? I like your paintings. Which one do you like best? This one. This one? This is a hero of the Civil War of 1812. - General Rayevsky. - I see. Believe it or not, I am... Are you leaving? None of your business. Then don't leave. Stay, if you're not afraid. Grandpa, did you hear? He said I'm afraid. I'm afraid of no one. I'm afraid of no one! Lena! Believe me, Lena is neither a coward nor a traitor. She's a personality. It's against my principles to betray other people's secrets. - I have to remain silent... - Grandpa, don't abase yourself! Wait. I wanted to stop her. She might need help. Aunt Klava. What do you want? Do you want a hair-style again? No way. Some other time. My working day is over. We're closing. You don't want to do it because I'm a traitor. My daughter's father lives in Moscow, and you... Because of you... It wasn't me who betrayed them. Stop lying! Stop screaming. I'm not lying. I haven't told it to anyone else yet. I took other person's guilt. What for? I wanted to help someone. And? And?! He said he would confess by himself. But he didn't. And you? And I said nothing. Have a seat. Come on, have a seat. Have a seat. I will make such a beauty out of you. This your someone... Promise you won't forgive him. Or have you done it already? There's no need to loosen the plait. Why, do you want a short haircut? I want to be bald. Hang on, I... I'll make Olympia. What are you doing? Are you out of your mind? Give me back the scissors! They call me Scarecrow. And I am a scarecrow. I'm a traitor. I want to be even more ugly. The old clock still goes The old clock a witness and a judge When you came home it greeted you with a strike It rang all the bells for you When you couldn't understand me I thought all sounds in the Universe would freeze But my clock was going solemnly and mournfully I could hear its funeral ringing Life is impossible to turn around And time cannot be stopped not for a single moment Guys. Guys. Look, it's Scarecrow. Come on, jump! Why aren't you dancing? It's a pity, you should have danced. You're all pretty as a picture. And I'm a scarecrow. Scarecrow! Scare-crow! Do you like my haircut? Oh, sorry, dear Dima, I forgot to wish you a happy birthday. I'm so silly. I came specifically for this, and yet I still forgot. Somov, why are you turning your eyes away? You must be suffering because I turned out to be a traitor. I understand, it must be hard for you. You're so brave and honest, and you were friends with a bad girl. Hi, Iron Button. - Hi. So what? - I don't understand you. You're so upright, but you are friends with Valka, who's a knacker. Tut-tut! He takes dogs to the knacker's yard for 1 rouble each. What? Have you already stopped skinning dogs? Valka, what is she talking about? Well? Hit me so that I shut up. Prove that strength is the most important thing. I will. I don't care if you're a millionaire's daughter. I'll hit you anyway. I'm so scared. Goodbye then. I'm bored here with you. By the way, rejoice! I'm leaving tomorrow. So, come on, all together now - 1, 2, 3 - Scarecrow is not in our class any more! What? Has cat got your tongues? Valka, do you want me to offer you a million? Frankly speaking, I feel sorry for you. You're poor, poor people. Ciao! Should I serve the cake? I wasn't expecting this from Scarecrow. It's a pity she turned out to be a traitor. Otherwise, we could be friends. - Alright, I'm going home. - Wait. Valka, what was Scarecrow saying about you? - She's lying. She's nuts. - Really? What is this then? - This is... - Give it to me. Allow me. Quiet, don't wake Sveta up. What is this? I'll tell Petya, he's got friends. Got it? Oh come on you, I won't do it again. I said, let's go outside. Don't you know Petya? He'll be angry. - Let's go. - Guys, Shaggy will strangle me! Button, here's a human being on a leash! Shaggy, let him go. - And you, stop crawling. Stand up. - You heard? Let me go. Do you take me for a dog? I can bark. - Alright, sod off. - Oh come on, it's not against the law. I take only stray dogs. Kids, it's time for you to go to bed. Good night, sissies. And Bessoltseva is a real human being. But anyway, there's no forgiveness to traitors. Where are you going? There's a cake. It's time. I'm off. Ciao! Right, we'll be going too, Dima. - Bye! - Goodbye. Where are you going, kids? Here comes the cake. Grandma! I'm leaving, I'm leaving. I won't bother you. I'll be in the kitchen. It's so nice! I adore sweets! Bags, the rose is for me! Happy birthday to you, Somov. I didn't want to disappoint you, Dima. - But Popik and me, we heard everything. - Heard what? We heard you talk to Margarita. We were sitting under the desk. Why didn't you say anything? We will continue to say nothing. Right, Popik? - We should tell everything. - Really? Open your mouth. Good riddance to you then. Dima, is it true that you can kiss? Don't be afraid. No, you can't. Look, you put this hand here... Come on, stand up. You put this hand here. You can't. You're an idiot! And now to the weather. No significant precipitations are expected today. Temperature will remain the same. Grandpa! What are you doing? Give me a nail. Are you coming with me? Put something on, you can catch a cold. What about the paintings? Let's take Masha with us. Let's take Masha with us. The boat is about to leave. Don't be afraid! I'm not. So he confessed, after all. Well then. Rejoice. Celebrate your victory. I'll go there. Lena, don't! Lena! But I rejoice! I celebrate my victory! Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. - Hello. Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. Hello. Hello, Aleksandra Vasilyevna. Let go of me! Leave me alone, or I'll jump! You won't! You'll break your legs. Step away from the window. Our millionare beauty has showed up. Hello, Scarecrow. Hello. It turns out, you're a good girl. - I guess it makes us... - You may hit us if you wish. It's good that you haven't left. Look at him. Guys! I declare the most severe boycott to Somov! Who is in favour? What about you? I am not. Have you forgiven him? Have you really forgiven him? I was at stake. Get down. What does this suspicious silence mean? What is this this gathering about? Why weren't you on the line-up? Everyone, we've got marvellous news. And where's Lena Bessoltseva? - Here she is. - Bessoltseva! She is right there. Oh God, I'm looking at you and still don't recognize you. Why do you have your coat on? You can't wear a hat at school. Why have you cut your hair? She burnt her hair on a bonfire. Alright then, we'll talk about bonfires later. Everyone! Come here. Lena Bessoltseva will now tell us marvellous news. Margarita Ivanovna, tell us about your wedding instead! - Vasilyev, you're not very modest. - Yes. This is what everyone in my family tells me. Everyone else is modest, except me. - Sit down. - Take my father... I've recently learnt... Alright, sit down, I'll tell them everything by myself. ... that Lena Bessoltseva's grandfather, Nikolai Nikolayevich Bessoltsev, presented the city with his house and his collection of paintings. This priceless collection of paintings is very valuable. And now we will have in the city our own city museum. - Hurrah! - How much was he paid? I just said, it was a gift. For free? Excuse me. I've come for my granddaughter. Take your seats. Everyone! This is Nikolai Nikolayevich Bessoltsev whom I was just telling you about. Do come in, please. Shmakova. It's me. Mironova. Valka. Somov. - It must be you. - Yes. Comrade Bessoltsev. Nikolai Nikolayevich, allow me to express... Thank you. I... It's the first time I've met such a person. Grandpa. I'm afraid I might burst into tears in front of the children, which I shouldn't. All of them? What an idiot. What about Masha? You see, I wanted to keep Masha for ourselves. You see, this painting depicts our fellow citizen and your colleagure, a language teacher. She used to live here hundred years ago, which is not so long ago. She's just my grandmother. This painting - I offer to your school. - You needn't! But this is national heritage! Keep it. - Keep it. - Thank you very much. What an idiot. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Take your seats. Bon voyage! Margarita Ivanovna, was it Somov who told you that we'd gone to the cinema? Yes. Why? So Popov told the truth. And we thought it was Bessoltseva. What does Bessoltseva have to do with it? Margarita Ivanovna, we're so sorry. We let you down. We disrupted your lesson, but we thought it was Bessoltseva. She took the blame! Somov, how did it happen? I wasn't the only one who said nothing! Shmakova and Popov knew about it too! - Shmakova too then. - It's not her fault. We were sitting under the desk. - She's kind. - I don't need your protection, Popik. And I don't want to sit near you. Besides, I like changing seats, so I'd rather sit near Dima, everyone's abandoned him. Right, Dima? She sat near Somov. And he's a traitor. Who is in favour of a boycott to traitors Somov, Shmakova and Popov? I'm out of here. I despise Somov, but I won't declare a boycott to him. Since Scarecrow is against it, so am I. She's not Scarecrow! I won't have you calling her like that! And you can beat me from all day long! I'm against a boycott! Then I will be the only one! I declare a boycott to all traitors! To all of them: to Somov, Shmakova, Popov, Shaggy and you Vasilyev - to everyone. Iron Button is crying. There must be an earthquake somewhere. You're all like my mother. You want everything to be hush-hush. You won't ask anyone about anything. You're all like that! All of you! All of you! What about the Bessoltsevs? But they are freaks, and we are normal, ordinary people. So you are ordinary? Or maybe Somov is? We're children from the cage, that's who we are. We should be demonstrated for money in the menagerie. It's her. Who? Bessoltseva. Scarecrow, forgive us!
