Subtitles by explosiveskull I want you to look around at the new faces today. These are your brothers and sisters. You will serve together, and you will fight together. You will laugh and you will cry together. This is your home and I am proud to be serving alongside each and every one of you. Now as we set sail, I want each one of you to think about what you are fighting to protect because that is the thing that will keep you going. That is the thing that will make sure that you never give up. I want you to remember our core principles: honor, courage and commitment. That is what sets the Navy apart. Why are we here? So others may live! Hooyah! Hooyah! And now it is my privilege to present to you a very special guest: Admiral King. You should all feel honored today as the Admiral takes great pride in welcoming new cadets. Admiral on deck! At ease, sailors! Thank you, Captain. You've all come a very long way, and now you'll be tested out in the open sea. So be careful. A mistake can cost a life. An even bigger mistake can cost a lot more than that. All I ask is you keep your eyes open, and watch your backs. I'm proud to be here. I'm proud to have you as my crew. This could be my last voyage. Let's make it count. Sir...? Now's not a good time, Vallier. Yes, sir. It's just... we've got something. What do you mean? Well, we've picked up something on the sonar. I think you need to see it. So what do we know? Not much, sir. How far down? We talking about a sub here? Not sure, sir, but I did catch a sound. A sound? What do you mean, sound? The timing on it, Munos? It's been about three minutes, ma'am. - You got a bearing on it yet? - I'm trying. What in God's name is going on? Captain on deck! As you were. What's going on? Strange signal. No bearing yet, but it's deep. - What is it? - We're working on that, sir. Okay. Can we work on it without hearing it? We're thinking it's either a sub or a drone. But since it's so deep, I'm willing to say it's not a drone. We're picking something up, sir. How far out? Closing in on it. Just... Is this it? Admiral on the bridge! As you were. Captain, what have we got? Looks like a sub. What are you gonna do about that? Well, we're working on it. Vallier, what can you give me? Well, it's hard to say, sir. But I'm guessing we're right above it. What do you think? I think we should check it out. - Lynch? - Yes, sir? Wait until the Admiral has a chance to speak. The Russians have been operating around this region for a really long time. But we never really had any hard proof of it yet. We need to find out if it's them. Well, if we're gonna step in it, then we're gonna have to clean it up. And I'd rather we get this over with before NATO sticks its big snout right in my face. - Or the president. - Yeah, him too, yeah. Well, we'll get to the bottom of it. I could take the bell down, sir. Admiral, if you'll excuse us? I need to speak with my Commander in private. All right then. You guys let me know. You do not speak to a CO like that! Especially in the presence of an Admiral. - Do you understand? - Sorry, sir. You really want to get that thing in the water, don't you? I do, sir. I helped develop that thing. Which you never tire of reminding us. All right. I'll consider it. Thank you, sir. Deploy the drones first. If there's anything worth looking at, I'll consider sending you. Yes, sir. Already on it. Excuse me, Commander? I may have already ordered the drones prepped, sir. Commander! Sir, I figured it would be something you would want me to do. Do you know what an order is? I do, sir. You don't do anything unless I tell you to. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. You can't take an order unless it's given. - Does that make sense, Commander? - Yes, sir. I went you to get out there with Munos, and I want you to observe the drones. But you do not do anything unless I tell you. - Is that clear? - Yes, sir. This is still my ship. Dismissed. How far down is the drone? Approaching 4000 meters. Switch to live feed. What's that, Munos? Where, ma'am? Third quadrant? Did you see that light? Or was that just a reflection? Boom. Right there. Zoom in. That looks like a Borei-II class submarine. It's been hit. All right. Let's get that over to the Captain. Sorry to keep you waiting, Admiral. You know, there's a lot of tension between our countries right now. And I don't wanna have to make a phone call to Congress over something to do with Russians, all right? I understand, sir. But if it is the Russians... - And the SPCC. - Yes, sir. Yeah, I got a meeting with the D.O.D. As soon as I'm done, I'll check back with you, all right? Yeah. So this is your last hurrah? Yes, sir. My ass is getting old and I can't wait for retirement. Well, that makes two of us. Hopefully, we'll be on the same beach together. Hey, listen, don't worry about Lynch. She's gonna be all right. Yes, she will, sir. I mean, it kind of looks like... Yeah. I've never seen anything like it. What could do that to a sub? Torpedo maybe? Okay. Then what fired it? It looks like the sub may be sealed off at the bulkhead. So there could be survivors? In theory. All right. I'll take that to the Captain. - You don't have to. - Captain on deck! At ease. Lynch, come with me. Vallier, call my Tactical Actions Officer - on deck immediately. - Yes, sir. - Nice work, everyone. - Thank you, sir. Now the only reason they'd be down there would be espionage. The Admiral thinks they're trying to tap into the Southern Pacific Communications Cable. I agree. Why does that not surprise me, sir? Jameson, come join us. Sir? Ma'am? Did you get eyes on that sub? - We did. - Russian? Looks that way. Should I prep my team? If we find Russian survivors, there could be a situation. Not yet. Although, have 'em at the ready. Things could change quick. Sorry, sir, but if we have the capabilities to do it, then we should... With all due respect, Commander, there's no guarantee that anyone's even alive on that sub. Right, but there's no guarantee that no one's not. Yeah, but they sure as hell will die if we don't intervene. Yes, they could. That's a risk they took. - Jameson... - Sorry, sir. None of that means that we can't go down there. I hear you, Commander. But who knows what the Russians might bring up with them? Or what they might do to protect whatever the hell they're intercepting from the SPCC. But it doesn't mean that we don't try to rescue them. Understood. I'd be willing to take that risk, sir. You would. You'd be willing to risk your life as well as that of fellow seamen just to get in that water? Yes, sir. I'd take responsibility. Well, that's very brave of you. But I'm sure you know it doesn't work that way. Sir, send me by myself. Go prep the bell. You take two with you. - Yes, sir. - But you listen to me. And you listen to me carefully. We're gonna send you down there, and that's your time. You own it. But whatever you bring up with you, they're to stay in the brig until we dock. - Do you understand me? - Yes, sir. I am still the Captain of this ship. So whatever I say, goes. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Jameson, prep Mansfield. Yes, sir. I want him to be one of your two. Thank you, sir. Dismissed. Heading down. Over. Okay. What's ESDS? It's Electro-shock Defense System. Cheng and I basically built the inside of the bell into a Faraday cage so we could electroshock blasts as a defense. That's amazing. So that's what the lines running outside are. The problem is, I wasn't able to hook it to the battery reserve. All right, let's keep it tight, Lynch. I always do, Captain. And don't get too cocky down there if we can help it. Yes, sir. Captain, are you seeing this? What am I looking at? I mean, it looks like... Like a bite mark? Just what I was thinking. What has a bite that big? No idea. Closing in and engaging with sub. Affirmative. Take it easy. We are aligned. Contact. Munos, confirm airlock to the sub. Confirmed. We are locked. - We're on. - Copy that. Bell's hatch is open, moving on to the sub hatch. Do you see anything? No, sir, nothing. Oh, my God. Does anybody speak English? I do. - Is anyone hurt? - All others dead. Come up, come up. Get in! Get in now! Lynch! Are you okay? Munos, get ready to detach on my command! Lynch! Commander! Come in! Set! Now! Lynch! Okay, sir! We detached just before the sub collapsed! How many did you get? Three. They all look pretty rough, but no one seems to be injured. What happened to you all down there? We were attacked. Attacked? By what? I think a shark. - A what? - Did she say shark? Yes, shark. Big one. Okay. Wanna tell me what you were doing down there in the first place? Well, we were... We do whaling, shark survey. We need to get up... quickly. Is not good down here. So that's your story? Shark surveying? Of course. We must get out of water before the shark find us again. You're lucky we picked you up on sonar. I'll take you back up, but you're gonna have to do better than that for the Captain. Mansfield? Keep an eye on our... whalers. Yes, ma'am. All right, Daniels. Bring us up. Captain, the Russians are saying it was a shark. Wait! A shark? You said it was a shark? Yeah. Are you sure? Did you check your systems, your sonar? Yes. It's obviously B.S. There's not a shark big enough to do that type of damage. Well, my guess is we're not the first ones to spot these guys. Somebody probably shot at 'em and left 'em for dead. Captain! What is it? Right there! What am I looking at? What is it? Sub? Not sure, sir. I need you to be sure! Yes, sir, Captain. Hey, Lynch, are you seeing anything down there? No, sir, nothing. Checking monitoring again. There! Wait, Captain. I think I see something. Could it be whatever fired on the Russians? Maybe, sir, but I don't know. It's blocking all my monitors. Oh, my God. What is it, Lynch? Lynch, come in! Are you there? Let me try to fix this now. - Try it again. - What happened, Lynch? Do you copy? It's a shark, sir! It's a massive shark! Lynch, are you okay? Damn it! I don't care what you have to do. I want you to find 'em. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. Stay away from that thing, damn it! Captain on the deck! What happened? Something has the bell, sir! What do we do, Commander? Hold on. Everybody, hold on! Status? Cable won't come up, sir! That's not acceptable, Cheng! I gotta get this thing up here! We tried to retract it, but the counterpressure is too much! What if we gun the ship in the opposite direction? If we had more power, maybe. But we've lost secondary power! We have to blow the cable! Communications are dead! Propulsion's offline too! Munos, take over! What did you do to get the shark to let go of you? Nothing. Nothing? Do I look like an idiot to you? Tell me now! We're gonna blow the cable! They'll all die down there, Captain! If we don't blow the cable, so will we! We don't have any other option! - Blow it! - Sir...? We have no other option! Blow it! Hey, what just happened? - I think they cut us loose. - What? Vallier? Do you read me? Vallier! Mansfield, get to the back. Watch them! Yes, ma'am. What was that? That was the shark swallowing us. No, no, this can't be happening! If we... - Enough! - We're dead! Munos, I need a report! Okay. We're losing power. Oxygen 90%, but it's not gonna last. Kill all nonessential power. We need to conserve. What do we have then? Maybe... I don't know. Half an hour? Munos, I'll be back. Times' up, sweetheart. I need to know everything now. Sir, there's only one blip now. I think the shark swallowed the bell. You're kidding me! Can you reach them? We have to make contact. Give me something. I'm trying sir. I really am. But nothing seems to be coming through. Can we get a signal at least? Negative, sir. That's dead too. Look. I don't care what you have to do. But I need you to get those comms working. Do you understand me? Sir! We need you over here! It's urgent, sir. Find a way 'cause your seamen are counting on you. Let's go. Yes, sir. I asked you a question. It was the sound of our drill... - Yana...? - Your drill? You ever hear of whale watchers who use a drill, Mansfield? No, ma'am. Yeah, me either. Cut the crap. I'm telling the truth. We were using our high-speed drill. And it seemed to draw the shark upon us... Hey! Drop it now! No, I don't think so. There is no more talking to be done. You understand? We're going up! - We can't... - Now! We can't go up! We're stuck inside whatever attacked your sub, And if you don't help us, then this is where we end right now! Then it is where it should end. And I start with this traitor. Grab the gun. - Mansfield? - Mm-hmm? Tie him up! Yes, ma'am. Get your hands up. Get your hands up. And you need to sit back down, huh? Just put your hands behind your back, broski. So how do we get out of a shark's stomach? If we can get the ESDS back online, I think we can shock the inner lining of its belly and get it to regurgitate us. Do you think that'll work? I don't know, but I'm gonna try. That should allow the electricity to pass through to the shock rods on the outside. Let's test it out. I'm gonna ram us into the side of the shark. Be ready to hit that button. Yes, ma'am. Here we go. Now! What was that? There goes the rest of our battery reserves. Did it work? No, it didn't. All right, what's the status on that bell? Just prepping sonar one. Can be ready... it's sinking, sir. The shark is heading down to deep water. It won't be able to survive the pressure. But if we cut... Look, we gotta get the ship up and running. And then what, sir? And then we save her. Then we save her. Commander, I don't like this pressure change. - If we go any deeper... - I know. I feel it too. How long do we have? That doesn't change anything. You will not save us. We will all die down here. Not if the United States Navy has anything to say about it. I'm sorry, but I'm not sharing your optimism about abilities of the United States... You better watch your mouth when you're talking about the Navy. Engines? Still dead, but if we can get the lines clear, maybe we'll get something. Pumps are running on battery power. But we'll tear through that soon enough. Save it. It's not gonna help us. Comms? That's dead too, sir. The power surge fried a lot of the equipment. But sonar is still operational. It's just running on batteries. Okay. That we'll need. Keep that thing up and running. I wanna know where it is at all times. Okay. - What about Morse Code? - Not sure, sir. I mean, it's routinely maintained, so it should work. How do we even know if Lynch equipped the bell with a telegraph? Well, knowing Lynch, she probably did. All right, let's give it a shot. It's all we got. You work on that Morse Code for me. - Copy that. - Dismissed. Why don't you just tell me the truth, hmm? What were you doing down there? We're all gonna die down here. Then what does it matter? Something funny about that, Natasha? You Americans are all the same. No respect for anyone but selves. And you Russians are all dirty, stinking... Hey! Hey, why don't you just tell me? What did you do there for the shark to leave you alone? I told you. Nothing. We use drill. Shark come, destroy sub. And what happened to the drill? Drill destroyed too. It slipped off cable. So you were drilling into the SPCC? What are you after, hmm? What is your mission? Told you. We are whalers. We were performing a shark survey. Hey, Munos? Do I like liars? - No, ma'am, you do not. - No, I do not. So I'm gonna ask you one more time. What is your mission? We are whalers. We're performing a shark survey. Okay, will this thing work? Well, I'm sending a signal. But I'm not receiving. Okay, please. Lynch is counting on all of us. Do your best. - Sir? - Yeah? Sir, the Admiral asks to see you on the signal deck. Okay. Bring Jameson up with you. I don't want to keep him waiting. - Copy. - Look. Get it done. Copy that. Admiral on deck! As you were, gentlemen. Captain, I heard about the loss of Lynch. Never easy losing a soldier, and she was a good one. There's no answer for it. I think you did the right thing. With all due respect, sir, we haven't lost them yet. With all due respect to you, Captain, they were swallowed by a shark. I mean... Well, you're not trying to tell me that you're contemplating a rescue, are you? That's exactly what I'm saying. If you want to put the men and women on this ship in harm's way, I'd have to find that to be gross incompetence. Sir, this is still my ship. If there's men and women are still alive down there, I'm gonna do everything I can to save them with or without your permission, sir. Well, that's true. This is your ship. And you are in command. And you don't need my permission. That's correct, sir. Except in the event of... what would that be, Ensign Burkhead, in the event of what? Sir? He's in command unless in the event of... In the event of gross negligence towards the ship, the lives of the sailors onboard or the protection of state secrets. You leave me no choice if you're gonna continue on this course but to relieve you of command and put you in the brig. So, Jameson, take this man to the brig. Sir, there's men and women still alive down there! It's a casualty of war, Captain, and we're at war. I mean, I would think you of all people would understand that. All right, Jameson, take him away. Is there a problem, Jameson? Yes, sir, there is. What would that be? Respectfully, sir, I don't take orders from you. You might be an Admiral. But while you're aboard this ship, you don't have the authority to take over command. Well, I most certainly do. Not if you're the only one who thinks so, sir. Burkhead, you take both of them to the brig right now. Is this really how you guys wanna play this? You're willing to risk your futures on a whim? Your military careers are gonna be over even before they started. All for what? For the lives of three sailors that might already be dead? They'd do the same for us, sir. Jameson, make sure the Admiral is comfortable in his quarters. Take your hands off me. Let go. You're all defying a direct order. Every single one of you on this bridge could be court-martialed for what you're doing. Do you realize that? You do what you think is necessary, sir. Sir, please? I'm sorry, sir. That's enough standing around. Let's go save our officers! Treadwell. Guard his door. Yes, sir! Getting something. Sir, they received the message. Okay, so they're alive now. Thank God. Okay, I need ideas now. - Well... - Sir? - Yeah? - I think I have one. Okay, Cheng, so explain this to me again. Well, sir, it's commonly thought that certain species of sharks can smell a drop of blood - from up to 500 meters away. - Okay. So it's safe to say that whatever we're dealing with is anything but typical. Okay, so what's your point? My point is this creature is capable of sensing blood from distances astronomically larger than that. Cheng, what do you think this thing might be? A Megalodon, sir. A prehistoric creature that hasn't been seen in a couple of million years. Then you're talking about the Megalodon? Yes, sir. I thought that thing only existed in myth. No, sir. Just extinct is all, or so we thought. - Sir? - Yeah, what is it? Right this way. Hey, Cheng, why are we in the galley? - Commander? - What is it? - I'm getting another message. - What are they saying? "Hang tight. We got a plan to bring you up. There will be blood." Rep? Send this back. "Oxygen at 60%. "Power close to critical. "Pressure increasing, but bearable for now. Thank you, Captain." The battery reserve? What do we have? Not much. Then I sure hope they hurry. I left checks on aisle one. Okay, where are they, Vallier? It's very hard to say, sir. The shark is heading down to deep water laterally, but... - But what? - It's just not right, sir. Explain that. Well, it just has an odd pattern to it. A odd moving pattern to it. Where's the nearest land mass? That would be Hawaii, sir. It's a thousand miles on the northeast. - Okay. Jameson? - Sir? Time to prep your team. Have them at the ready. We're gonna lure the shark back up to the ship. It's not gonna like what's waiting for it. Yes, sir. Should I prep the artillery guns? It wouldn't do any good unless we get a good distance between us and it. Most likely, sir. But it couldn't hurt to have 'em ready. True. Okay, let's prep the artillery. Make sure the sideboard guns are working. We'll see if we get a good line of sight from there. Yes, sir. - Burkhead? - Sir! Have your men on standby. Be ready to deploy the lifeboats. Once that thing comes up, we're only gonna have a few minutes to get it off the diving bell. You got it, sir. I'll get 'em out. Choose three men to go with you. Yes, sir. Sir? May I ask how you plan on luring the shark? Here it is. That's all the steak we got on the ship. - Such a waste. - Yep. Then it's beans and rice for the next six months, fellas. Thank you, Morris. You sure this is gonna work? Not at all, but in theory, it should... So, what? We just throw this bag of chow in the water and wait for the shark to take the bait? Pretty much. Cheng, what are we doing about the electricity? Well, sir, we're about to hook it up right now. It's semi-based on what we did with the bell. Didn't Lynch say that wasn't gonna work? This will, sir. Well, I don't wanna fry the last bit of what this ship currently has. That's really where CS Morris comes in, sir. He retrofitted his galley to run entirely off of DC power instead of gas. So we have an entirely self-contained system? Yep. And the ship remains unaffected. Morris, when we dock, remind me to get you a promotion. Yes, sir! All right. But the galley doesn't have the same amount of energy that the entire ship has. That's correct, sir, but it should give us at least 30 seconds of killer juice before it fries everything. Then we're cooking our meals over an open fire. Okay, all right, let's see what we got. Hit it! It works! Nice work, everyone. Cheng, no matter what, do not flip that switch unless I tell you. - Do you understand me? - Yes, sir. Make sure our sailors are safe. All right, let's get that thing in the water. Dismissed. Status! It's closing in on it, sir! It seems to have taken the bait! - Cheng, are you ready? - All ready on deck, sir! Waiting for your command! Jameson? Ready here, sir! Let's light this son of a bitch up! Vallier, did you get the message to Lynch? Sure did, sir. Good! Everybody be ready! Let's go! I'm getting something else here. - What's it say? - "Be ready to move. You'll know your window when you see it." All right. Thank you, Munos. Mansfield! Hold it down back there! This could get rough! What are we going to do? Drive out? That's exactly what we're gonna do. It's right below us, sir. - There! - This is it! Get me everything she's got, Munos! Get me everything she's got! Come on! Everything she's got! Do I have two separate pings yet? Not yet, sir, but we should have impact in three, two... Oh! That is how you drive! Sir, I have them on sonar. - Confirm again, soldier. - Yes, sir. I have two separate pings right there. There! Welcome back, Commander. Looks like you've been through it. Nice to see you too, Burkhead. That ride for us? Yes, ma'am. We got 'em. Sir, we got 'em! All right, good job, soldiers. But we're not out of this yet! Chang, as soon as everybody's onboard, I want you to fry that thing! You understand me? Yes, sir. Burkhead! Okay, everyone, this is it! No matter what happens, let's bring our sailors home! Hooyah! - Man overboard! - Man overboard! Two in the water! Grab the rope! Grab the rope! She's on! Jameson, are they clear? Not yet, sir! - Cheng, are you ready? - Ready! Wait for my command. All clear! All clear! Light it up! Shut it down! Mansfield! Cut the cable! Cut the cable! Thanks. And a private suite for Ivanov. It's pronounced ee-van-ov. - And for you, Captain Ivanov. - Okay, Captain. Well, we're gonna get to know each other real well. All right, comrades, party's over. Sir, I think we should question Popov. Let me question Ivanov first. But, sir, she has information on the mission about what they were actually doing down there. And she's frightened. I think I can get her to talk. I can hear you, you know. I speak American, or did you forget? Am I wrong? Okay, we'll question Popov. Let me get Ivanov first, all right? Yes, sir. Jameson, bring them inside. Bring him down below. I'll be there in one minute. Lynch, you come with me. So where do we stand? Well, sir, the bell's being brought onboard, sir. I can see that. What else? The trap drained most of the power from the galley. I was able to get comms back online, though. Okay, good. Were you able to send the transmission? Yes, sir, but it doesn't look like we're gonna get help any time soon. Of course not. How we looking on this shark? Well, sir, it seems to have taken the bait. The sonar's pretty clear. Cheng, I need you to find a way if this thing comes back - to come up with a plan, okay? - Yes, sir. Lynch, I want you to guard the bridge. Jameson and I are going to question Ivanov. Sir, I can... Commander, you almost died today. I want you to take a deep breath and be grateful you're still alive, okay? Get yourself cleaned up and guard the bridge for me. Yes, sir. I'll be back shortly. Dismissed. Clear the room. Yes, sir. Step out, gents. So, Commander Lynch tells me that your mission down there was some top secret research. Top secret? No, Captain. I am a scientist. We don't get to do secrets. So I've heard. But let me ask you this. Why would one of Russia's top submarine officers decide to throw it all away and become a scientist? Come on, Viktor, you had to know that we know. You got me, Captain. You speak Russian? Now are you surprised? Now I'm gonna ask you one last time because my patience is running thin. What were you doing down there? Were you trying to tap into the SPCC? We were to study whales. If we find out that you were trying to interfere with allied forces, there are going to be some very serious consequences. Is that what you think? You think your president is going to lift a finger? You overestimate the intelligence of your current Commander-in-Chief. Why are you Russians always so arrogant? Why are you Americans always are so piggish? You know, Captain Streeper, in my country... We are not in your country! We are on my ship! And that means, if I give Jameson an order right now to shoot you, he will not hesitate. So here's what I'm thinking. I'm thinking you were trying to tap into the Southern Pacific Communications Cable. And I'm thinking that, while you were down there drilling, you have awakened a monster from the bowels of hell. The problem is that you got caught. This not only makes you a, enemy of the United States. But an enemy against humanity. I don't think the Kremlin's gonna be very happy with that. Some pretty bad publicity. So I'm gonna ask you one last time. What were you doing down there? I love whales. Stand up. Move. Viktor? Make sure the Captain is comfortable. Yes, sir. Miss Popov, have a seat. Now I can't stress this enough, and I need you to be honest with me. Commander Lynch has informed me that you're willing to share information that your commander was not willing to give up. I understand. What were you doing down there? I can't tell you that, Captain. Miss Popov, I have risked the lives of my sailors to save your life. Not to mention facing a horrific beast. The least you can do is to be honest with me. If you are asking why we were down there, you already know. The pipeline? Do you realize the amount of international outcry this could cause toward your country? That is not my call, Captain! I am soldier in Russian military first even if my specialty is science. - That does not excuse... - No, it doesn't! But what choice do I have? Can I say no? Do you tell your president no? No, I guess not. What do you want to know, Captain? I do not wish to die out here. What were you searching for in the pipeline? The most dangerous thing your enemy has, Captain, is their secrets. We're after secrets. Sir? Can I have a moment? Sure thing. Excuse me. That shark is still out there. I do not wish to die here, Captain. That shark is as dead as your freedom. It's a long ride home. Get comfortable. Right here's good! - Oh, yeah. - Ah, man. That's the life right there, man. - Cheers? - Cheers. Cheng, this better be important. We got a million things going on right now. Sir, I think I have a solution for if the Megalodon returns. What is that? Some kind of detonator? Yes, sir. We already know that the shark is attracted to the bell. So, theoretically, if we fill it full of explosives, we can use it to lure the shark and blow it up. Are you telling me that you've taken a $2 billion dollar submersible prototype and you've turned it into a cherry bomb? I used every spare part I could find. I think I could probably get a couple hundred feet of range on this thing. - Well, at least it's not 10. - 10 would be bad. - Okay. - Okay? If that's the best we got, that's the best we got. A bad plan is still a plan, Cheng! Yes, sir. I'll start rigging it up with fuel now. Thanks. Anything? Damn it! Come on. Really? Captain on the bridge! At ease. Learn anything? Well, Ivanov didn't want to talk. But Popov admitted to the SPCC. Said she was down there for their enemy's secrets. Did they mention anything about the sharks? Only that she didn't wanna die down there. So they were drilling the SPCC? - Yeah. - Pentagon's gonna love that. Well, that's their problem. How we looking on the ship? We're still dead in the water, but... Yeah, but Munos is working on it right now. - Sir? - What is it? It's back! What do you mean, it's back? The shark is circling the ship. Yeah, but it's moving away there. Well, where is it going? Okay, Vallier, where were we when we first picked up the signal? We picked up the sub right about here. All right, so based on our drift as well as start position, sea current, that would put us right about here. - That's right about, sir. - Okay. So the shark's going at a 45-degree angle northeast. No. I need you to get with Cheng and work on that diving bell. Okay. I know you're upset about this. But it seems to be the only thing that's gonna work. You know that diving bell inside and out and I really need your help. Yes, sir. Let's get down to the engine room and make sure that engine's running. Yes, sir. Good? Ready to try it? Right here. Ready? Damn it! What is that? What is that sound? The sound from earlier. Yeah, but where's it coming from? Just give me a second. I think it's coming from the ship, sir. - Sir? - What's up? - It's back. - What's... what's back? - The shark's back. - The shark is back? What are you talking about, the shark is back? That means it hasn't left. I thought it left the sonar there! You were just saying that a few minutes ago! I know! Okay, get every branch of the military on the phone right now immediately. - We are under attack! - Copy that! Command, this is the USS Shaw. We need immediate assistance! Here we go, gents! Post up! Move, move! Right there, right there, right there. Head on a swivel! Post up! Post up! Move! Post up. Down! Go! Head on a swivel! Port side, 200 yards out! There! Fire! Fire! Coming in! Coming in! Burkhead! Big gun! Get on the big gun! Copy! Move! Move! Take that, you son of a bitch! Movement forward! Fire! - That's it? - Yeah. All right. Cease fire! Cease fire! Sir! This isn't working! Munos, shut it off! It's making the shark crazy. Yes, sir! Shut it down! Sir, the Russians have escaped! Okay, go! Jameson, get to the brig! - Where is it? - What? Hello, Commander. Nice to see you again. What did you do? Take a look. You idiot. So quick you judge. You say idiot, I say smart. There is no way I'm letting you take us back to your country to make example of. Yeah. Well, you just made sure we're all gonna die. So thanks for that. You. Toss it overboard... now! No. Do it now or we will kill you both. Do it. Good girl. It is a shame we couldn't get to know each other better, Commander. I have enjoyed this time we spend down there together but now we must take the boat. And leave you all to fight giant fish on your own. You're not going anywhere, Red October. - Lieutenant? - Yes, sir? If the Captain doesn't put that weapon down by a count of one, please shoot him. Yes, sir. Cover me, cover me! Secure the deck! Burkhead, secure the bridge! Yes, sir! Damn it! No, I understand, sir. Thank you, sir. Well, that was the Pentagon. They wanna stay hands-free. What? Do they know what we're dealing with? They do. They're trying to come up with solutions, none of which we're gonna like. Sir, I have some news you're not gonna like either. What is it? Ivanov is armed. He released the bell and made Cheng throw the detonator overboard. Jameson and his men are pursuing him now. Anything else? About 90 seconds ago, the shark swallowed the bell, sir. Is there any way we can make it on the detonator? It is possible, theoretically. If I can find more parts, I think... - You think? - I'm sorry, sir. I mean, I will. - Good. - I'm on it. Everyone's counting on you. Sir! With your permission, I need to lock down the bridge! Permission granted. Where is he? - Who? - Don't get smart... Jameson, give me a report. Jameson. Sir, Jameson's been shot! We think it's the Russians, and they jumped ship. Burkhead, I need you to get down there and figure out what happened. Yes, sir. What do we do, sir? Well, we're gonna figure out from Cheng. - Sir? - Will that thing work? I think... yes, sir, definitely. - Only one problem. - What is it? It's only gonna have a short range on it. How short? 20 feet, sir. 20 feet? - Did you say 20 feet? - Yeah. Well, at least it's not 10. No! I'm sorry. That's not good enough! Hey, Commander... I'm not gonna let anybody else go down... Commander! Excuse me! Everybody leave us for one minute, please. Thank you! - Commander... - I'm sorry, sir. I just don't wanna lose anyone else. This was supposed to be a simple mission! Look at me. Look at me! One day you're gonna make a fantastic Captain. Thank you, sir, but... Unfortunately for you, that day is today. No. No! I am ordering an immediate evacuation, And I'm putting everybody under your command. No! This is a suicide mission! This shark is gonna take down this ship! I need you get everyone in the lifeboat. I'll deal with the shark. But I need somebody to find the Admiral. - You don't have to do this. - Yes, I do! The Captain goes down with the ship! And one day, you'll understand that! Now I'm giving you an order and I expect you to execute it. Lynch, watching you grow has been one of the greatest achievements of my military career. Thank you, sir. Dismissed. All right, listen up because I'm only gonna say this once. We've seen better days. We lost some brothers and sisters today. But we also saved a few as well. We have found ourselves amid a potential international crisis, not to mention facing a beast thought to be millions of years extinct. Well, that thing wants to take us out. But we will not let it, because we are the United States Navy! We never quit! And we will never surrender! Not today, not tomorrow, not ever! We survive. Look, we've never seen anything like this, not in these waters. I have ordered an immediate evacuation and I have placed you under the command of Commander Lynch who will make sure that she sees each and every one of you safely home. This thing wants to take us down? Fine. Let it. Because we are going to blow this thing apart because we are part of the greatest military in the history of the world: The United States military! Hooyah! Hooyah! It's been an honor serving with each and every one of you. And each and every one of you represents the Stars and Stripes, the flag of freedom. And when times get tough, I want each and every one of you to think about our core principles, our core values: Honor, courage and commitment! Because that is the United States Navy way! Happy sailing, ladies and gentlemen. Dismissed. Treadwell, get yourself onto that lifeboat. Get off of this ship. Let me have that. Watch yourself, okay? - Yes, sir. - Relieved. Everyone is ready, sir. Good. We've prepped the engine room, sir. And I think it's safe to say... I know. Go. You get to that lifeboat, sailor. That's an order. Yes, sir. Commander! Where are you going, Captain? Come on, Captain. Let's not draw this out. Ivanov, you know I have to turn that engine on! Don't forget about my mission, Captain. You have no mission, Ivanov! Hello, Commander. What did you do? Nothing. Come on out, you son of a bitch! I gotta be honest, sir. That was some movie hero type shit. You bet your ass it was! Streeper, you gotta get off this boat. No, Admiral. The Captain goes down with the ship. You know that. You taught me that. Yeah, I did. Now it's time to forget it. Actually, gentlemen, this is my ship. Goddamn it, Lynch! What are you doing down here? No time for that. Let's get you two topside. No, no, no! No chance of it! I'm done. I'm finished. I ain't gonna make it. Lynch, get the Admiral to the lifeboat right now! Get on a boat and get out. Save yourselves, both of you. You gonna martyr yourselves over me? There's sailors in the water out there. They need you both. I'll take away my last chance to have any glory in this lifetime. You're relieved of duty. That's it. Actually, sir, he gave command to me. Well then, God speed to you both. - Get off the ship. - Yes, sir. Leave me. Go. Sir, you're gonna need to be within at least 20 feet in order to make this thing work. You gotta free the switch in order to activate the sounds so that the shark is still interested in the ship. He's definitely interested. From the sound of it, 20 feet won't be a problem. Sir, if I may, everything in my career, I owe to you. It has been an honor serving under you, sir. You've been a good officer. Get the hell outta here. Thank you for everything. You're welcome. Well, hello, big fella. You know, my wife keeps telling me to quit smoking. I guess now's a good of time as any. What do you say? Adios. Thank you, Admiral. Subtitles by explosiveskull
