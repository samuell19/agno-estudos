There's someone here I want you to meet. Britney! Britney! My God. I'm so sorry. It's just the age that she's at. Hey! Britney! This is Brody. Brody, this is Monica. -Hey, Brody. -Hi. - What's their name? -They don't have names yet. They're just babies. -How old are you? -7. -We're, um-- we're trying to find some homes for these little guys. Buddy? You remember what I said about waking them up? -I know. I know. -Okay. -I'm really -- I'm just so happy that you're here. I've -- I've been wondering what you'd be like for such a long time. So, um, how would you like to handle this when we get to the house? -I... I'm not sure. It's been a long time since I've seen them. -You ready? -Yeah. -Okay, here we are. -Hmm. -She's resting. -This is Monica. Monica, this is Leticia. -Hello. -Hi. -Well, let's go. -Genie? -Here. -Let's go see Grandma. -Oh, hi. Hi, dear. Oh, give me a kiss. -Hey. -Hey, give me a kiss. Oh. I'm just so happy to see you. -Genie. We've brought somebody with us. This is Monica. -Mm. Hi. -Hey. -Monica's come to help us. -What? What are you doing? I told you I don't want anybody from hospice. -No, no. No. Sh-- She's not from hospice. It's okay. -And -- And she -- -I'm not dying, Laura. -I know. I know. It's okay. It's okay. -I don't need any help. -I know. -You know I can do things by myself. On my own. -Mm-hmm. -By myself, you know? -Mm-hmm. -And I have Lettie. -Yeah, yeah. -Are you leaving? -No, no. Of course, not. -You wouldn't leave me. -No, no, no, no. I'm leaving for the night. But I'll be back tomorrow, you know? -But I don't need any help. -Hey. -I don't need her. -Genie. -I don't want her help. -Genie? Genie? I promise you everything's gonna be okay. Okay? Monica's just come to help us. I promise. Hey, Jimmy. Um, oh, fuck. I'm s-- I'm sorry. I just thought -- I know you -- I know you told me not to call. But, um... I'm going through a lot right now. And um... I just need to talk. I just need to talk. I just need to hear your voice. That's all. I'm sorry. Okay? Fuck. If you could just call me... Just call me when you can, please. Um... Okay. I love you. -Hey. -I love looking at these pictures, too. -I was just admiring your wedding dress. It's so pretty. -Oh, that was actually your mom's. Um, obviously, I was -- I was very honored to wear it. But my makeup was all wrong. And that hair, it's so bad. -It's not so bad. -Guys, stop running, please. Your grandma is sick upstairs. God, they do this every single time we're here. The light switch for the kitchen is -- is over here. It's not the most obvious place for it. -Oh. I remember. -Oh. Yeah, of course, you do. I'm sorry. Um, here is all of the medication. I know it's -- it's a lot to take in. But there are instructions on each of these bottles. Um, I have to warn you, though, she does not like to take them. So, that can be a little tricky. Every phone number you might need is up here. Paul's cellphone, our home phone. That is your mom's handwriting. She writes everything down. -Sorry. Laura. -Hey. Yeah? -She's fine now. Mm? -Okay. -She just needs some time. You know her. -Yeah. -I'm off. Um, it was nice meeting you. -Oh, you, too. -Thank you so much, Leticia. You get home safe, okay? -You, too. -Have a great night. Bye. -You, too. Bye. -That woman is an angel. I honestly don't know what we would do without her. Oh, my God. I am so tired. Let's sit down. Would you like to sit? -Um, sure. -So... the -- the three of us usually just trade off time with your mom. Um, I come around when I can. Paul usually comes in the morning before work. If there's any kind of an emergency, I would prefer you to call one of us before you call Leticia, because she's alternating nights between here and with her family. So, you know, we don't wanna impose on her too much. We actually found this amazing nursing home for your mom. It was like -- like a five-star hotel or something. But she didn't wanna hear about it, did she, buddy? She didn't wanna hear about it. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I mean, I don't think Paul wanted her to go there either, to be honest, which I get it, you know? This is her home, so... -Yeah. -As you saw, she was, um -- she was pretty confused. -She was. -Um, I hope it's okay with you that I didn't try to explain to her who you are. -No. Um, it's fine. -I just thought, you know, that's probably an important moment for you guys. I didn't -- I didn't wanna take that away from you. I don't know what I would do if I couldn't be with my own mom at a moment like this. So, that's -- that's why I wanted to call you. Actually, found you myself. -Oh. -Yeah. Um, but Paul's gonna be here tomorrow. And I think it's -- it's gonna be really important for you guys to spend some time together. The two of us have actually been having like a little -- a little rough patch lately. -Oh. Well, I'm sorry. -No, no. That's okay. It's gonna be fine. Would you like to hold him? -Oh. Um, I could. -Yeah. He won't bite. This is your Aunt Monica. -Hi, sweetie. -Hey, bud. This guy's always been very affectionate with me. He's my little brave heart. But this one, he was the end of me. No more babies now. It's gonna be the end of the line for this family for a long time I think. Have you ever thought of, like, adopting maybe? -Um, sometimes. -Yeah. -What's that? -That is something I've had for a very long time. You wanna check it out? Actually, if you wind that thing... ...and pull this out. -Oh. Don't touch those, buddy. -You're my good girl. -Hmm. You're my baby. My sweet, sweet baby. Sweet. -Hi. -Hi. -Did she poop? -No, she didn't. -Hmm. Uh, I was told to bring you these pills. -Well, you don't have to do that. I don't want them. -But these are the ones that Laura said to give you. -I don't take those pills. Can you close the door, please? Thank you. -Mm. Hi, baby. Oh, you did miss me. I know you did. You're so sweet. Can you give me a tip? You know I got what you want here. I know what you wrote. I know it's unique. Good boy. You feed that meter, honey. Make me feel nice. Yeah? Okay, I can do that. -Mama! Mama! -Um... -Mama! Mama! Mama! Where's my mama? Where's my mama? Hey. -Where's my mama? -Hey. It's okay. Shh... -I want my -- my mother. Please. I want my mama. I want my mama. -I know. -I want my mama. -I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Don't cry. It's okay. It's okay. -Hello? -Hi. -Hi. -I made some coffee. Do you want some? -Uh, no. Thank you. Gotta say, I never would've recognized you. How long you gonna stay? -However long. I met your family. They're lovely. I like Laura. And Brody. He looks just like you. -Yeah. He actually reminds me more of you. - I'm gonna go check on Mom. -Paul. Um... What do the doctors say? -Uh, I'm takin' her later today. I'll know more. -And how are you doing? -Things have been very tough around here. -So, how long will she be here? -I don't know how long. -I only want Lettie. -Stay like this. This light looks so lovely on you. -Are you filming me again? -I am. -Oh. No, I'm tired. I look awful. -You look beautiful. -Mm. -You're the beautiful one. Not me. Not now. -Enough of that nonsense. I love you. -I love you more. I made you. You've come out of my body. I was the one to make you. Listen, Paulie. Those kids need a mother and a father. -You're right. -Whatever's happening, it's not worth it. -Mom. Come on. -Family comes first. -Please don't worry. -I never wanna come here again. Understood? I-I don't care what they say. Promise me. -Everything alright? -This usually doesn't take too long. -She didn't recognize me. -Well, did you expect her to? When are you gonna tell her? Or are you gonna tell her? -I don't know. -I wanna show you something. I've been taking these videos for us, uh, or for Benny. Uh, this one. -Ever since you were a little boy, you always got what you wanted. But you never wanted to ask for permission. You were too -- too shy. Too polite. So you'd always send your brother to do your bidding. And he'd come over to me and say... "Paul wants to go camping with his pals. Can he go?" And I'd say, "No, he can't go." "Okay, I'll tell him you said, 'Yes.'" And he'd walk away thinking it was funny. And I'd find you packed and ready. And I'd say, "Who told you you could go?" And you boys would go to bed all quiet. You'd give me the silent treatment. I couldn't stand it. And he'd come back again in the morning. And again, "Mama, Mama, can Paul go? Please let him go, Mama. Please, please let him go." And he wouldn't stop until I'd finally tire out and say, "Fine. Let him go. Go on." And I'd start making a packed lunch for you. And together, we'd watch you go. I never could resist him... ...and his relentless little pleas. You always got what you wanted that way. That little devil. The house was never quiet. -The doctor is ready for you. -I'll show you the rest later. -Should I come? -Her condition is worsening. Um, the tumor is growing, putting additional pressure on the brain, which causes confusion and limited mobility. There is a new experimental treatment we could try. -Well, the last surgery almost killed her, so she doesn't wanna go through those excruciating procedures again. And who could blame her? And she doesn't wanna take the Donze-- uh, Donzepil -- -Donepezil. -Whatever it's called. -Mm-hmm. -She doesn't wanna take that. It gives her headaches and makes her nauseous. So... - Well... Look, there really is no sugar-coating this. It -- -I'm sorry. Oh. Paul, I'll just be a minute. I have to take this. -Okay. -You need to stop calling me once and for all. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Stop calling, stop thinking about me. -Okay, Jimmy. Okay. That's all you had to say. Yeah. -They just want the best for you. -Mm-hmm. -I don't like being there. Hmm. -Is this sore? I know, I know. -Mm. -We are done. -Okay. -Okay? You ready? -Mm-hmm. -Monica? Are you still there? -Yeah. -Do you mind helping us with this part? I think it's good for you to know what we do. Put your arms around my neck. -Yeah. -Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Robe, please. -Oh. Ah. -Hi. Yeah, that's what I thought, too. Um, so, wait. What are your initials? What -- I mean, what's your name? What do your initials stand for? Oh, that's cute. Yeah. Right. Um... No, actually, I-I don't live here. I'm just here for a while. I'm not sure how long. Mm-hmm. Well, thank you. Likewise. So, you remember what I told you, right? Okay. Yeah, that's how I feel. Um... So, I guess, I'll link up with you in a bit. How long have you been standing there? -Oh. I -- -Please knock or just announce yourself. It's the proper thing to do when you're a guest in someone else's house. -Sorry. I just came to see if you needed anything before -- -You're all dressed up. -Yeah. I figured I would just step out for a little bit. -Well, that's good. You know, you don't need to stay around all the time. I can take care of myself. I'm sorry you've been put in this position. What's your name again? Please remind me. -Monica. -Monica. That's a nice name. Is it a family name? -No. It's the name I chose for myself. -Oh. I wish I could change my name, too. Eugenia means... "born into good genes." That's not me, clearly. Look at me. Mm. I hate my name. -Hi. -Hi. How beautiful you look. -Thanks. -Hey, love. -Mm-hmm? -One more thing. Do you have somewhere I could plug in my phone? It's dying. -Oh, no, honey. I'm so sorry. -I have nowhere to plug it in here. -It's okay. Um, where's the bathroom? Hey, hey. Um, I'm here, at the place. Um, it's right off the highway, so you can't miss it. I just wanted to check on you, and see, uh, how far away you are or whatever. Um... I will be at the bar, drinkin' my bourbon. And I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye. -Hey, love. Do you have somewhere I can plug my phone in? It's dying. -Good one. -I can charge your phone. I have a charger in my truck. -I'm sure. Um... I'm good, though, alright? I'm waiting on somebody. Thanks. Probably him. -Hello? Hi, Laura. Um, hold on. It's loud. Let me go outside. Okay? Hey, uh... I guess you're not coming. Um... I drove from really far away. So, I don't know what -- what the point of even making plans with me was if you weren't gonna show up. The least you could do is fucking call me and tell me that you're a coward. I don't know why you asked me all those questions about my body if you were not interested. I'm not your fuckin' experiment. Fuck. What? Hi. Uh, I'm sorry about that. Look... I'm just -- it's been a rough week, and, um... that wasn't really directed -- that wasn't -- that wasn't for you. Uh, I'm still here. Just chillin'. I'll be here for a little bit. If you decide to come, cool, you know, shoot me a text. Um... I'll be here for a little... Okay. Hey, Jimmy. I just wanted to call you and tell you that you're a fucking coward, and I'm stupid. I am stupid for giving you so much of myself for so long. You're a taker. That's what you are. You're a taker. And I actually feel sorry for you, because you'll never meet anyone who will love you the way that I loved you. Know that. Have a good fuckin' life! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, choke me. -I have to -- I have to go home. Okay? -Alright. -Could you zip me? -Yeah. -Thank you. Fucking hell. Shit. Ugh. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Hi, Mom. It's me. It's me, your party girl. Your party girl. Hold me. -I'm sorry. Hey. -Are you coming with us? -I don't really know how to say this, but, uh, something's come up, and I have to, actually, leave. -Is everything okay? -Yeah. Everything will be fine. -Where are you going? Are you coming back? -Um... no. No. So... But thank you. Thank you. Um, I'm sorry. I have to, um -- I have to go. But I wanted to say thank you for everything that you're doing. Thank you so much. - Good luck. -Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. -Hey. -I don't understand. What -- What is this? What are you doing? -Paul, I can't be here right now. I just... I'm sorry. Okay? I gotta go. -So, what, that's it? That's all you can take? That's all I can take. -Being here, yes. -Oh. Uh, your family's lovely. Please hug Laura and the kids for me, okay? Take care of yourself. -Come on. You... -What? -Whatever. Just go. -Ah. There it is. All fixed up. - Fuck. -You ready? Go slow. Okay. You'll be in your own bed soon. -Here, I got you. Yeah. -Hold on. Hold on. -Hold on. All good? -Is everything okay? -Yeah. Everything's okay. -Thank you. -You guys really let this place go, huh? -Yeah, well, we kinda stopped taking care of it after Dad died. -You know, earlier today when you ran after me... ...it reminded me of that time on the way to school when I had two different kinds of shoes on. And you ran back a whole mile just to get my other one and bring it to me. You ran so fast. -I do remember that. I still have this image of you in the distance, standing there on one leg, like a flamingo or somethin'. -I was scared that Dad was gonna find out and it would be all my fault. I used to dream about this pool all the time, you know? This feels like another life. One day... the dreams just stopped. -Is it -- Is it true that you slept on the streets? -"I can no longer be your mother." That's what she said to me... ...when she dropped me off at the bus station with five minutes to spare, so we couldn't talk about anything. And that moment is burned into my brain. After that, I was just on my own. -There were so many times I wanted to run away. I used to... fantasize about coming to find you and living with you. -I thought about you, too. All the time. Mm-hmm. It's pretty. You look beautiful. -She's the beautiful one. -Mm-hmm. -Let's try it on her. -You want? -Lettie. -No. -Yes, some. Yes. -Come. Open. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You look the best. -It looks gorgeous. -Look. Bonita. -Bonita, too. -How are your grandkids? -Mm. -I heard your grandson is singing at the graduation. -He's so happy. He's singing the, uh... He's singing the, um -- He's singing the, um... What's it called? The... -What is what called? -Oh. This is terrible. It's just, I'm stupid, stupid. Um, what is it -- What -- What -- -The -- The national anthem. -Yes. -Don't worry, Genie. -That's what he's singing. -I always forget my words, too. -Mm. This has grown back in. Do you see, in here? -Yes! Look how full this looks. I'm never losing it again. Never. -Thank you for bringing her. Genie was my very first client. My number-one client. Right, Genie? -Mm-hmm. -What do you think? -You look beautiful. What? What? - Look at him. How sweet. Look at you two. -I am so sorry about what is happening to your mother. -It's okay. -You know, I have a son. -Oh, yeah? -He was just released. I used to take the bus to see him once a month. But... he's out now. They just released him. -Oh, that's good. -Mm-hmm. Your mother, she helped me so much. -Aww! -See? This is him. -Oh, he has a beautiful smile. -Mm. -Mm-hmm. -He is a good guy. -Yeah, I can tell. -Yeah. Maybe he look tough, but... ...when I look at him, I see my baby. -Mm-hmm. -Mm. -He's lucky to have you. -Your mother, she's lucky, too. -She doesn't know who I am. -You don't know that. You know who she is. Hmm? -It's kinda quiet. I should probably go check on them. Make sure everything's okay. Do you mind holding him? -Thank you. Push! Push, push! Come on! Push! Come on, you're almost there. Push! Yes, yes! One last push. -It's a girl. -Hm. She's beautiful. -What are you naming her? -Monica. -Aah! -Hey! What's going on in here? Huh? What are you doing? Huh?
