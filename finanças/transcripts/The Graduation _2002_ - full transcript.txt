Did it take the picture yet? No, not yet. What do you need it for? Uh... "3, 2, 1..." "Is this photo acceptable?" "Thank you." You don't mind if I have this? OK? There you go! Fish for dinner after the Aquarium? Oh yeah... I'm sorry. What? You apologize a lot. Then you look away. Let's eat. This is sardine, and this is alfonsino. There are three types of alfonsino. "Beryx decadactylus", "splendens" and "mollis". This is "splendens". And the sardine is a "pilchard". Did you work at a fishmonger's, too? My mother taught me. Only about food fish, though. Two more months till March. So? Graduation. Oh, yeah... Two years, gone in a flash. "Mutsuki", January... "Kisaragi", February... Spring ends in March in the lunar calendar. "Yayoi"...'increasing life'. In primary school... ...I had a friend named Yayoi. Her birthday was in March. There's lots of different surnames it sounds good with. Sato Yayoi, Takenaka Yayoi, Ayanokoji Yayoi... See? Yeah. Mayama Yayoi... And so on. We should've brought that umbrella. The two of us need it. "Sensei"...let's hold hands. Huh? Hey! I'm going to hold onto this hand permanently. Teachers and students don't do this. Why not? Just kidding! See you at school. I'll make some coffee. My dad's pestering me to get things settled. Sorry. I don't mean what happened the other day. I need... ...someone to think of a good reason to say no to a man. Not you. My family's arranged for me to marry someone they know. I see... When we first met, it seemed like you weren't definite about anything. But then you said... ...that when we met, it was love at first sight. But there was a reason for that, wasn't there. I look like someone. You weren't seeing me. You were seeing her. "Sugita Asami" Ms Sugita? Yes? You're Sugita Asami? Yes. Thanks. Your report... ...I'll wait till the last lecture. A lucky charm. My mother gave it to me. Nice smell, huh? Page 20... Coming-of-Age Day. I was only 18. There wasn't time to wait till I was 20. Come on! Tell me how nice I look in a kimono! Oh... You look really nice. It's yours. Keep it. But... I have to go to work. "Hello? It's me." "Can I see you tomorrow? At Nanako's restaurant?" "Um..." "...anyway, I'll be there."

Like a drink? Why not? That creep! He'll get his. Three years... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Another. I don't have any reason to say no to him. 18 years... 19 years... Good night. You'll lose the most important thing you have, you know. Stop going to that Aquarium. She's not coming. Stop torturing yourself. You don't have to any more. The more you do that, the less yourself you become. It's time to forget all of it. If you don't, you'll lose the most important thing you have. That's what the woman who used to come to the Aquarium thinks. "That's enough," she says. "Thanks for everything." "Sensei"... ...you won't let yourself look bad in front of me, will you. But you need someone you can look bad in front of. I wanted to see you... I wanted to tell you... But I guess it's better if I don't. Thank you for thinking of us all these years. I'm glad... ...I finally... ...met you. "Hello? It's me." "Can I see you tomorrow? At Nanako's restaurant?" "Um..." "...anyway, I'll be there." "Miyamoto Izumi" "Mayama Satoru" "This is the Message Center. You have dialed 090..." Yes? One moment, please. Izumi, telephone. Phone. Who is it? A Mr Takita. "Takita"? Miyamoto speaking. "It's Mayama." This is the last lesson. Not for a resume... Looking for a gift? Do you know what violets represent in old poetry? "Think of me." There's tons of them across the way from a friend of mine's room. But he doesn't notice. Some people can't put things into words even if they notice. Putting some things into words ends them. People who know that... ...take a long time to decide about anything. But once their minds are made up, they carry it through to the end. That's why my mother fell in love with my father. "Mr Mayama Satoru" "Yoshida Yayoi" Izumi... I'll be right with you. Don't be too long. Izumi! It's not true. You don't "look like someone". It doesn't matter. I love you. I know that now. No more. Not because you look like someone. Mayama Satoru... Year of Birth: 1960. Age: 41. Blood Type: O. Aquarius. Unemployed. What? The school let me go. I'm looking for a new job. Hobbies... ...none in particular. Reading and walking, if I have to say something. Dislikes: Quarreling... ...photographs... ...uh... Appointments. Yeah. The introduction usually comes before the break-up. I don't want to 'start over'. I want to start. There's so much... ...I have to say to you. You take a long, long time, don't you. Mayama Satoru...
