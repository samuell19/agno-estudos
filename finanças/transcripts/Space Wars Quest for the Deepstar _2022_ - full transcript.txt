(bright music) (liquid splashing) (bubbles fizzing) (glasses clinking) (thunder cracking) (electricity zapping) (booming) (clanking) (droning music) (bright music) (liquid splashing) (orb shattering) (brooding, mysterious music) - [Narrator] The year is 2980, and we now know that death is not the end. A soul can be extracted from the recently deceased and be used to create a blue liquid called essence. It can bring a person back to life in the form of a cyborg-human hybrid. It's an expensive process used by the rich and powerful. The rest, they do what they can to survive. (dramatic music) - [Judge] Malachi Monroe, you have been charged with the crime of interstellar civil disobedience. How do you plead? - I didn't do anything wrong. - I'm afraid your lack of honesty and remorse leaves me no choice but to find you guilty as charged. - But you have the wrong- (box clanks) (dramatic music continues) - Malachi Monroe, may the gods have mercy on your soul. (laughs) (controller beeps) (box clanks) (Malachi screaming) (lava exploding) (Nolgath roaring) (dramatic music continues) Kip Corman, you have been charged with the crime of interstellar theft. How do you plead? - The only thing I'm guilty of is being a better scavenger than you. - Yet here you are about to be dropped in the mouth of a Nolgath. I find you guilty as charged. - Why don't you drop the judge act? You're a murderous leech that couldn't even find the Dolstar Crystal, even though it was practically sitting in your own backyard. - It's a shame your daughter couldn't be here to see this moment. When I find her, and I will find her, she'll suffer the same fate as you. (controller beeps) (box clanks) (dramatic music continues) Any last words? - I'll see you soon. - I will tell everyone that your final words were incoherent groveling and begging for your life. Goodbye, Kip Corman. (controller beeps) (box clanks) (Nolgath roaring) (tractor beam zapping) (gun rattling) (explosion booms) (door whirring) No! (buttons beeping) - Give me the helm, sweetie. You cut that pretty close, don't you think? - I barely got this running. I'll need to finish repairs when we get to the trading post. - I got one more thing I gotta do. (dramatic music continues) (guns rattling) (gun zapping) (explosion booming) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (ships whooshing) (device humming) (computer beeping) - [Computer] Alert. Quantum circuit unstable. - [Kip] Taylor. What are you doing? - How'd it go? - Is this salvageable? - No. - Dammit. - Elnora? - I swear that woman, she gets a kick outta screwing with me. - She owns the only trading post this side of Wantanian Skytrail. - So? - She screws everyone over. - How's the ship looking? Can we go? - The light system is at quarter capacity, and the hyperdrive is in rough shape. - How rough? - We'll be able to make one jump, but that's it. We'll need at least five million credits to fix it. - Dammit. - What did we get for the crystal? - 500,000. (Taylor scoffs) - Yeah, she totally screwed you. - Yeah, yeah, she screwed me... (siren wailing) - Dad? What did you do now? - I didn't do anything. There was this coin. It was like a... It's, it's- - Not again. - She left it out. I didn't know what it was. - Dad! (engine whirring) Is this a "we should probably get going" situation, or a "we should get the hell outta here" situation? - You know I don't like that language coming out of your mouth. However, in this situation, hell is appropriate. (computer beeps) Speak of the devil. - You must be the dumbest man in all the galaxy. - (scoffs) I'm not the one who left an artifact from the Dandolian period sitting out. - Return the coin at once or suffer the consequences. - And what would the consequences be? - I will tear you limb from limb and bathe in your blood and your tears. - Wow. - That must really mean something to you, huh? - It belonged to my sister before she died. It was her most prized possession. - I'm sorry, I didn't know that. My condolences. How did she die? - I killed her. - Okay. (dramatic music) (computer beeping) Blast off. - [Officer] Warning. Unauthorized ignition. 750 Penalty points - have been applied to your navigator's license. - [Computer] Warning. Unauthorized liftoff. (gun zapping) (tracker clanks) (dramatic music continues) - [Officer] Your navigator's license is revoked by the Department of Space Vehicles under Code 750 point- (computer beeps) - [Computer] Gravity activated. Astrogator engaged. - What are we gonna do now? - We gotta find a big score. Get back on our feet. - You shouldn't have spent everything on- - Hey, hey, hey. Taylor, there's a lot of things I regret in my life, but that's not one of 'em. (pensive music) Remember back in the day, we'd head out into deep space. No chart, no plans. - We never had to worry about credits. It was just about having fun. - You said we can make one more jump. - Yeah. - Let's make it and see where we end up. - A good old-fashioned adventure. - Exactly. (Taylor laughs) (computer beeping) - [Computer] Neutrino drive activated. - Hit it. - [Computer] Hyperjump in three, two, one. (ship whooshes) (dramatic music) (engine roaring) Hypernavigator calculating. - [Ezekiel] Come on, let me handle this. - I am not going to risk having to waste credits to bring you back again. - I won't let you down, Mother. - (scoffs) That'll be a first. - [Officer] Cleanup in Zone 7. - [Computer] Prisoner secured. - [Operator] Zone 7 is secured. - Fine. Assemble a small team and retrieve that artifact. - What about Kip? - Bring him back to me if you can. - And if I can't. - Do what needs to be done. - He's as good as dead. (dramatic music) (engines blasting) (ships whooshing) - [Computer] Scanning hyperchannels for tracker. - I hit them with a tracker. They did a jump to Sector 63A. Follow me. - [Gentry] Copy that. (ships whooshing) - Oh, I'm so glad I found you. It's been so lonely all by myself. Now will you dance with me? Just you and me. (cheerful music) Wow. (alarm blaring) (dramatic music) Oh no. (engines rumbling) (dramatic music continues) - And there she is. - I don't know how she thought she could escape us. - [Computer] Docking coordinates locked. Scanning comms channels. - Can we link to her comms? - Negative. She's blocking us. - All right. Let's knock on the door. - Okay. - Hey, a friendly knock. She's no used to us dead. - As you wish. (computer beeping) - [Computer] Weapon systems armed. (beam zaps) Station shields disabled. - Manx, prepare to board the station. (dramatic music continues) (ship whooshes) - [Computer] Target detected. Sector 5. - Can you track that pod? - Give me a minute. Honing in on it. - [Computer] Tracking target. - Got it. - (chuckles) You can run but you cannot hide. (ship whooshes) (ship whooshes) - [Computer] Neutrino core streaming. Life support steady. Charging EM batteries. - We'll get her back. - We never should've been in that sector. - Well, I forgave you. Mom will, too. - I hope so. (Taylor groans) Why don't you get some rest? - I'm totally awake. (yawns) Maybe a nap will be okay. - Go on. I got this. (pensive music) - Love you, Dad. - I love you, baby. And I love you. And I'll get you back. (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) - [Taylor] Goodnight, Mom. (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) (melancholy music continues) (dramatic music) - [Computer] Geoscanning. Planet profile: Class 1. - [Nina] And we have arrived. - Good. I need you to stay with the ship. - Oh, let Manx stay. - I need someone I can trust. - [Computer] Autopilot engaged. - Manx is too dumb to even think about betraying you. Come on, just let me go. - Fine, but you cannot harm this woman in any way. You understand? - Aw! You're no fun. - [Computer] Approaching target. - And soon I will have all I desire. - And what is it that you desire? - The universe. (dramatic music continues) (ship whooshing) - [Computer] Warning. Stellastar Station ahead. (computer beeps) (ship whooshing) - Stellastar, this is Captain Kip Corman. Are you there? - [Computer] Scanning for life signs. - [Kip] Stellastar, are you in need of assistance? (computer beeping) - [Computer] Weapons scan clear. (melancholy music) - Screw it. (ship whooshing) (ship clanking) (monitors beeping) (Taylor groans) (melancholy music) (Taylor groans) - Dad? - Good morning, princess. - Where am I? - You're in a Class Six recovery unit. - Where's Mom? (melancholy music continues) - Um... I spent everything we had, but I didn't have enough to complete the process. I'm sorry. (monitors beeping) (melancholy music continues) (Taylor gasps) (Taylor exhales) (Taylor sighs) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - Are we docked? - Space station floating dark. - Do they need help? - I offered. No reply. - So it's abandoned? - Apparently so. - You know what that means. - Back in the game, baby. - Yeah! (ship screeching) Oh! (groans) The zero gravity stabilization unit's malfunctioning. - Can you fix it? - Not without parts. - I'm gonna have to manually rebalance the thermothrusters. Would you mind doing the recon yourself, then? - Of course. (ship screeching) (Taylor groans) I'll check for parts first in order to get this old lady back up and running. - Hey, she might be old, but this ain't no lady. Keep me updated on what you find, huh? - Will do. - Maybe you'll find something cool. (dramatic music) - We're almost there. (dramatic music continues) (aliens chattering in foreign language) (alien speaking in foreign language) - What did he say? - Something about wanting to die. - Well, we can be hospitable. Let's honor their request. Tell them we accept. (Wade in foreign language) (alien speaking in foreign language) - [Dykstra] There we go! (Nina grunts) (kick thuds) (punches thudding) (Dykstra grunting) (punches thwacking) (kick thuds) (punches thudding) (alien growls) (Dykstra grunting) (punches thwacking) (knife whooshing) (Wade grunts) (body thuds) (Nina grunts) (kick thwacks) (flesh squelches) (Wade grunts) (alien groaning) (alien growls) (guns zapping) (alien groaning) (dramatic music continues) - That was fun. - [Dykstra] Let's go. (ship screeching) (Kip groans) - [Computer] Mag Locks released. - Hey, Taylor, any luck over there? - [Taylor] I found some of the parts we need. - Can you tell what kind of station it is? - [Taylor] It appears to be a research station of some sort. - Galactic or privately owned? - [Taylor] Definitely private. There is some contraband. - Anything interesting? - [Taylor] A whole bunch of liquid stuff. - Ooh. I'll get a bottle of that. (ship screeching) (Kip groans) Make it two. (foreboding music) (gun zaps) (door whooshes) - Do you think those things took her? - No. But you gotta admit, she's pretty crafty. - She's still on the station. (foreboding music continues) (mysterious music) (mysterious music continues) (Jackie sneezes) - Bless you. - Thank you. (mysterious music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (lock clanks) Hello. - [Taylor] I'm back on board. Meet me in the back. (computer beeping) - Stay right there. - Put the gun away. You're gonna wanna hear what she has to say. - First, we need to get outta here as soon as possible. We don't have much time. - I'm the captain of this ship. I'll decide what needs to be done. - Look, I've got 16 million credits on here. (dramatic music) - Dad. - You're lucky. The captain just decided it's time to go. - Okay. (ship clanks) (engine whirring) - [Computer] Sublight engines online. (ship whooshing) (dramatic music continues) - All right, tell me again, where did you find her? - She was hiding in a space suit. - And you trust her? - She seems harmless. - Taylor, that's what you said about that three-headed baby dragon that grew into the destroyer of worlds. - I don't think we have to worry about that. - Hmm. (dramatic music) - [Computer] Scanning for targets. - Were they worthy opponents? - No. They weren't much of a challenge. - Nothing's a challenge for the mighty Manx. - I strike fear in the hearts of those who cross me. I demand my turn. I will go on that ship and kill that woman dead. - And you were worried about me. - Sit down! We can in no way, shape, or form hurt the woman. You win by bringing her back to me alive. - Then I will deliver her to you alive and unharmed. - Okay, talk. - My name's Jackie. It's nice to meet you. Aren't you gonna tell me your name? I know your daughter's name's Taylor. She's very pretty. - Kip. - Oh, that's a nice name. Captain Kip. - Just Kip. - Yes, sir. I'm a scientist. I specialize in celestial cartography. - Celestial cartography? - Mm-hmm, it's a branch of cartography that deals with mapping stars, galaxies, other astronomical objects on the celestial sphere. - Wait, you told me you were hiding from some dangerous people. - Yes, Dykstra, the leader of the group after me. He read some of my theories regarding some ships getting lost in the Triangulum Rift, including the legendary Deepstar. - People have been looking for the Deepstar for years. It can't be found. - That's 'cause they can't find the distress beacon. You find the beacon, you can find the Deepstar. I know where it is. It's what brought Dykstra to me. He said he was part of a private firm seeking a salvage claim, and he wanted me to plot them the course. Their goal was to find the Deepstar and claim the vast riches on board. I started to notice that some things were off about Dykstra, and his team. - What do you mean by off? - They pretty much kill everyone they encounter. And they enjoy it. I realized that once I found the Deepstar, I'd be next. So when we stopped on Dover, I borrowed a ship and escaped. - Borrowed? - Without permission. I feel bad about it. I do. The ship was damaged in the escape, and dead as a Carnelian cowerpuss. - Well, you're lucky you stumbled upon the station. - Oh, that wasn't luck. I worked there 10 years ago. The lucky part was my credentials were still valid. My goal was to get to the station, borrow another ship, but the station was empty. The log said that they were on a research mission to the outer rim. My ship was too damaged to fix, so I waited, hoping that someone would show up. - If we find the Deepstar, we could get enough credits to bring Mom back. - Why do you trust us? - You haven't tried to kill me. - Well, what about these guys you said are after you? - Oh. - Don't worry. I left something for 'em. - That's my girl. (dramatic music) - Jackie! It's the mighty Manx! I am here to return you to Dykstra. (whimsical music) (device beeping) Where are you hiding? Oh! (device beeping) - I can't believe you let him go alone. - Even Manx could not screw this up. (explosion booming) (dramatic music) - [Computer] Debris collision. - What the hell happened? - (sighs) Well, it couldn't have been a power surge. The station was dead. - Dead is what Manx is, though I will not share a tear for him. Jackie, though, we needed her. - I know. - Check the ship and try to find out what kind of damage we incurred. - [Computer] Warning. Structural impacts. (Dykstra sighs) Systems alert. Life systems compromised. - The Deepstar was so close. I could almost feel it. - There still may be hope. I found something- - She was the only person who had any chance of finding it. - Well if you would let me finish. I found a signal for a ship that recently left the station. She may have escaped on it. - Can you find it? - Already on it. (suspenseful music) (ship whooshing) - [Computer] Astrocharts calculating. (whimsical music) - Don't touch that. - Ooh! - Stop touching things! - Ah. - Stop! Please. - Excuse me. I fixed the turbo thrusters, but the hyperspeed is still shot. - Good work. - [Computer] Sublight incursion. Proximity alert. - I think we got company. (ominous music) - Did you really think you could run across the galaxy with my property and I wouldn't find you? Tell me that you're not that stupid. - I'm not that stupid. - You're in no position to be a smartass. - Am I a smartass or am I stupid? You know, you're starting to sound confused, Elnora. - I will make you wish that you were never born! I will rip out your fleshy parts and proudly display them on my desk in a glass jar. That way, if anyone thinks of ever crossing me again, they'll see what lies ahead in their future. - This is my old boss. - Oh. Hi, I'm Jackie. - Shut up! - She's rude. - Uh, guys, I would save this conversation for another time. (dramatic music) - Warning. Proximity Alert. Multiple sectors. - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Probably not. - What are we thinking? - Sit down. (ships whooshing) (dramatic music continues) - You will never get away from me, ever. (computer beeps) - (laughs) We can thank the asteroid field for that bit of luck. (engines whirring) - What are you waiting for? - They're entering an asteroid field. - So what? - It's too dangerous. They'll never survive. - I wouldn't be too sure about that. - I'm not scared. I'll go in there and make you proud. - I would expect nothing less of my flesh and blood. - For the family, I will- - All right, just get on with it! (engine whirring) (ship whooshes) - [Computer] Warning. Warning. (ship whooshing) (dramatic music continues) Collision imminent. (ship whooshing) Hostiles approaching. - Guys, we have company. (lasers zapping) (explosion booming) - I order you to support him. - Are you serious? - Help him or don't bother coming back. (engines whirring) (thrusters blasting) (lasers zapping) - [Kip] This was a bad idea. - Too late now. (lasers zapping) (ships whooshing) (dramatic music continues) (lasers zapping) He's right on us. (lasers zapping) - I can't shake him. But... - [Computer] Warning. Collision alert. - I can bake them. You ready? - Yeah. - What now? - Go! (impact thuds) (Jackie gasps) - [Computer] Warning. Warning. Collision imminent. (engine whirring) (lasers zapping) (dramatic music continues) - Not again. (explosion booming) (engines whirring) - Way to go, Ezekiel! - Time to get out of here. (ships whooshing) - Oh, you did. (Kip laughs) - Y'all are nuts! - Status report. - The ship has been destroyed. - Are you sure? - Yes. There's been a massive explosion. - Ezekiel should be in communication range on the other side of the asteroid field momentarily. (ship whooshing) (dramatic music) - You're alive? - And well. The other ship, I'm afraid not so much. - My son, Ezekiel, was piloting that ship. - I didn't know that. From one parent to another, I'm truly sorry, Elnora. - Sorry doesn't replace the credits I'm going to have to spend to bring him back again. - The credits, that's what you're upset about? The credits? - Mark my words. You will pay! (engines droning) (computer beeping) - [Computer] Rebooting. - How much damage have we sustained? - She'll fly, but just barely. - Well, that's all we need. Nina is tracking a ship. - You think she escaped? - I hope so. Otherwise all this is for nothing. (dramatic music) - You sure it's this one? - If the coordinates were input correctly, then yes. - I know why no one's found the beacon. - Why? - This is planet Zeno. It's also known as a death planet, rumored to be inhabited by giants. They'd see us coming from miles away. - [Jackie] Okay. - What about the pod? It's small. It might be able to slip through undetected. - It's a delivery system, Taylor. It's designed to be flown remotely. - But there are controls. I've used it before. I can fly it. - No, no, we're not doing this, okay? All right. I'll do it. - No! The controls require minute adjustments. You're too heavy handed. - I'll go. - It's our best chance of getting Mom back. - We're not even sure it's down there. - May I? - Go ahead. - Okay. We're close enough now that I think that we can hear the distress beacon. (beacon chiming) You hear that? It's there! (bright, hopeful music) - Dad. We have to do it. - I can't go through it again, Taylor. - I won't let that happen. I promise. - Take a rifle. - Okay. (dramatic music) (Kip sighs) (keypad beeping) (door whooshes) (dramatic music continues) (pod whirring) - [Computer] Engines to speed. Trajectory calculating. (dramatic music continues) (engine whirring) (pod clanks) - I shouldn't have let her go. - Do you really think you could've stopped her? - No. - I just can't stand not knowing what's going on down there. - She'll be fine. I can tell, she's special. (dramatic music) (footsteps approaching) (dramatic music continues) - Whoa! (creature growls) You are a big guy. (creature growling) Okay, move along, big guy. (gun zapping) (explosion booming) (creature growls) Okay, I get it now. (dramatic music) (tracker hissing) (tracker beeping) (triumphant music) (triumphant music continues) (beacon clanking) (triumphant music continues) (melancholy music) - Who's the picture of? - That is my wife. - She's pretty. I always wanted to be part of a family. Where is she? - She's... The beacon's moving. (suspenseful music) - Ha! That means she has it. She has it! (wind howling) (dramatic music) (ground rumbling) (creature growling) (footsteps thudding) (creature growling) (creature growling) (gun zapping) (creature growling) (ground rumbling) (mysterious music) (gun zaps) (dramatic music) (ground erupts) (creature growling) (creatures growling) (dramatic music continues) - [Computer] Launch sequence activated. (engines whooshing) Engines to speed. (creature growling) Trajectory calculating. (ominous music) (beam zapping) (dramatic music) - What's going on? - [Computer] Tractor alert. Tractor alert. - Oh no! (dramatic music continues) - She should be back now. - The beacon stopped moving. (computer beeping) - Who am I speaking to? - Captain Kip Corman. Who are you? - My name is Dykstra. I'm sure you've heard about me. - I have. - Then you know the position you're in. I have your woman. - What I do know is that if you hurt her, I will kill you. - I'm not gonna hurt her, but my friend here, that's a different story. All I have to do is snap my finger and things can get very messy. I'll make you a trade. I will dock your ship, I give you your woman, you give me mine, and that's the only offer on the table. I know I can count on you to make the right decision. (computer beeps) - I knew I shouldn't have let it go. - It's okay. I'll go. - If he's who you say he is, he'll kill us all regardless. - So what do we do? - Kill him first. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (docking mechanism clanks) (alarm blaring) Eyes open, Jackie. (ominous music) Jackie? (suspenseful music) (gun zaps) (both grunting) (gun zaps) - That's enough! Nina, come and join the party. - Gladly. - I'm sorry. - What did you do to her? - I gave her a sedative. - Do whatever you want to me. Just let her go. - I was gonna. I'm not the monster I'm made out to be. But you know, I changed my mind. You can keep Jackie. I don't need her. I have what I need. - Why did you offer a trade? Because you have something really important that I want. (foreboding music) - Don't, don't touch her. - I don't need her. I need your ship. See, this one has seen better days and it looks like you made it worse, and for that, I'm gonna keep this little pretty thing as payment. - I'll kill you. I swear to God. (gun whirs) - Famous last words. (suspenseful music) Goodbye, Captain. (ship thudding) - [Computer] Hull integrity collapsed. - What should we do with her? - Leave her. They can die together. (blow thuds) (ears ringing) A captain is supposed to go down with his ship. Lucky for me, this is your ship now. (thudding) (explosion booming) (alarm blaring) (Taylor moaning) - Taylor! (mom coughing) Mom Taylor! Taylor! (alarm blaring continues) - Try not to move too much. Don't worry. Effects of the medication will soon subside. (Taylor sighs) - Can I get a swig of that? (lips smacking) You the enforcer of your team? - I'm not part of any team. - But you're the tough guy, right? - Yeah. You could say that. - Where are you from? - Jeriba. - Moon of criminal scum. - You've been there? - No. But I've heard stories. - Yeah. The stories are pretty bad, but it's way worse. Definitely not a place for women. Maybe Nina. She'd probably do all right. (mysterious music) My mom tried, but... - What happened? - She got sick. She used to scream all night long. The screams still echo in my head. And then she died. - What are you doing with these criminals? - I am scum, just like them. - No. You seem different. (mysterious music continues) (electricity zapping) - Captain, can you hear me? (Kip grunts) Hey. - How long have I been out? - An hour or so. - We got to get the ship up and running and get after them. Whoa! We, uh, we must have tools and spare parts somewhere around here, right? - Yes. I gathered everything I could find. - All right, let's get to it. (ship whooshing) (mysterious music) (Taylor laughing) - This stuff is strong. - Lightweight. - You better not try anything. - I'd like to try a lot of things. - Well, what are you waiting for? (mysterious music continues) (mysterious music continues) (mysterious music continues) (gun whirring) (mysterious music) (Wade sniggers) Tease. - I will shoot you. - Yeah, you don't have the balls. (gun clicks) - Oh, I... I think you need this for it to work. It's a shame. I was hoping to get a little bit of action first. - Let's go. - I'm over it, honey. Maybe later. - Captain, can I get the slazon, please? - Got it. Here. - Thank you. (slazon whirring) Whoa, I'm feeling lightheaded. - We're probably running low on oxygen. - How much time do we have? - A ship this size, well, three hours. - Why do I feel a but coming? - Well, the last hour, the body will be fighting to stay alive. Physical activity will be pretty much nonexistent. - You coulda just said two hours. (ship whooshing) - Your gun wasn't the only thing I found. Tell me, does it really bring people back from the dead? - A body dies. Their soul and being can be kept alive through extraction. The body, created through robotics and donor tissue, is an exact replica. - A cyborg-human hybrid's hardly a human being. - A body isn't what defines a person. It's their soul, their essence that matters. - Tell you what, If I ever run into one of those freaks, I'll kill it on principle alone. - How would you even know? - Oh, I'd know. (Taylor gasps) - Be careful with that. - Who is it? - My mom. - Well, don't worry. I'll take good care of her. (electricity zaps) - Ow! Dammit! God! (tool clatters) (tool whirring) - You never did finish telling me about your wife. Please? I'd really like to know. - We were rich and we loved adventures. We went places we never should've went. And I took chances I shouldn't have taken. We crashed. We lost an awful lot. But I could buy it back. So I thought. I didn't realize how expensive essence was. I spent everything we had. Now we do these salvage missions, hoping to get enough credits to finish the process of bringing her back. - You will. If everything they say about the Deepstar is true, you will have so many credits, you'll have nothing to worry about ever again. You'll be set for life. (brooding music) - All I want is my family back. - Then let's finish the repairs and go get them. (dramatic music) (computer beeping) - (chuckles) I told you I would find the Deepstar. - And I never doubted you. - That's why you are the only one I will share it with. - What about Wade? - Wade, he's too unstable. - Hmm. And when the time comes, I want you to take care of him. - Anything for you. (dramatic music continues) - My son is dead again because of you. - He was a better pilot than me. - Me too. - So are you both saying that my son is dead because you're both inadequate with your jobs? - Yeah, uh, no. I mean, no. (gun zaps) (dramatic music) - Ezekiel was the best. I had no doubt in my mind that he would complete the mission. - Are you saying that he failed? - No. Yes. (gun zaps) (dramatic music continues) - Prepare my ship. I'll kill Kip myself. - Well, only one thing left to do. - Well, stick it in. - No, it's not that simple. It could go in two places. You put it one place and it fixes the ship and it brings the main power online. You put it in the other, it manually starts the hyperdrive, but if you start the hyperdrive without being fully powered up, the ship will be crushed like an empty can. - Well, which one does it go in? - I don't know. Taylor usually does this stuff. - Come on. We're running outta time. Now we're gonna run into that hour-long death struggle thing and I would really like to avoid that, please. - All right. Let's flip a coin. - That is a Dandolian Reclam. Where did you get it? - I borrowed it. Tails. Left. (system whirring) - Hey! We did it! We did it! It's working! (system zapping) (ship clanking) Oh! (electricity zapping) (Kip coughs) (electricity zapping) - How did you know what would do that? - The main metal in the coin's absomium. It disrupts magnetic fields. It's why they stopped making 'em. Two outta three? - No, I'm just gonna switch it to the other one. - [Computer] Rebooting. (both laughing) Restart protocols. - I knew that. - I hope Wade has been taking good care of you. Did you treat her right? - A gentleman never tells. - I bet. I just wanna let you know that we're getting close to our destination. Once we get the treasures we seek, we'll let you free. - That's a load of shit, and you know it. - I like your honesty. So tell me, who's this lovely lady? - I think that's her mom. I just so happen to have her essence. - There was a point in my life this is all I wanted. I had a wife once. - You never told me that. - Well, we all have our secrets. My family was not born into wealth. We were not lucky like you. When I lost her, I really lost her. You see, rich people don't really know what life is. You desire something, it's right at your fingertips, and you can fix any mistake you make. - That's not true. - Oh, really? This says different. I assume the captain was your dad. And "was" is a key word here, because he died an excruciating death. - I wouldn't be so sure of that. - (scoffs) Unfortunately the Sadar doesn't have a pod, and the pod that we captured you in is in this ship. (dramatic music) Maybe I'll bring your mom back, and I'll make her my new wife. (dramatic music continues) Or maybe I'll take you. - I will die before I let a creep like you touch me. - Hey! You will show him the respect that he deserves. He's one of the best men in the galaxy. Rescued me from Slaver's Bay. I owe him everything. - So you traded one slave life for another? - (scoffs) I am no one's slave. - Sure you are. You're just too stupid to realize it. - Oh, you think you're tough, huh? I will slap that grin right off of your face. - Oh, I'm sorry. I don't fight girls. (Dykstra grunts) - I think I'm in love. - Aw! Does someone have a little crush? - Shut up! (slap thwacks) - You know, I take back the creep thing. You are pretty sexy. Maybe I'll be your new slave. (dramatic music) (both grunting) (punches thudding) - That's enough, Nina. - No, it's not! (Nina grunts) - [Wade] Jesus! (punches thudding) - You're all talk. Maybe I'll keep you alive and make you my slave. - Now you're dreaming. - Goodnight, sweetheart. (Nina grunts) (dramatic music continues) (bones crunching) (Taylor grunts) (headbutt thuds) (punches thudding) Playtime's over. (electricity zapping) - [Computer] Systems alert, systems alert, systems alert. (alarm blaring) (dramatic music continues) - Hey! Wade, get her! Nina, come and help me. (keypad beeping) (door whirring) (pod whirring)- [Computer] Launch sequence activated. (Taylor yells) (dramatic music continues) - The pod ejected with two people inside. I think Wade double-crossed us. - Just stay focused. (Taylor yelling) - [Computer] Engines to speed. (pod whooshing) (Taylor grunting) Trajectory calculating. Warning, warning, collision alert. (pod whooshing) Impact in 30,000 feet. 25,000 feet. 15,000 feet. 10,000 feet. (Taylor yells) (pod whooshing) 5,000 feet. 400 meters. 90 meters. 80 meters. 70 meters. 60 meters. 50 meters. Collision alert. 40 meters. (pod whooshing) 20 meters. Brace for impact. (impact thudding) (ship whooshing) - Prepare for impact. (alarm blaring) (impact thudding) (Nina yells) (Nina panting) (dramatic music) (ship whooshing) (engines whirring) (hyperdrive booms) - [Computer] Sublight drives engaged. Weapons systems armed. Coordinates locked. - Everything look good? - Good enough. - How are we gonna find them? - They're on my ship. It's my home. I have a tracking device on it. - Okay. - And we also have something they don't have. - What? - Working hyperdrive. (Jackie chuckles) (engines whirring) (hyperdrive booms) - Want me to track the pod? - No, we have the beacon. Check if we can fly. - All systems seem to be intact. - I'm coming for you. Dykstra? - Elnora, darling. How are you doing? - Where's Kip? - Ah, right to business as always. Well we had a little situation. I took his ship. - Is he dead? - That's hard to say. I left him on board my ship, though. His situation was dire. - I want him dead or alive. - Fine. I'll send you the transponder code of my ship. You can track him down. But I only ask you one thing. - What's that? - If he's still among the living, just let him know his daughter suffered greatly. - Is she still alive? - Not for long. (foreboding music) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (rocks clatter) (Taylor gasps) (foreboding music continues) (foreboding music continues) (gun whirring) (foreboding music continues) (dramatic music) - Hyperdrive disengaged. - [Computer] Proton-based life form detected. - Oh, come on! - [Narrator] Warning. Nav systems down. - A Zonarapolis space cloud? I've heard of 'em. I never saw one. - We're not going anywhere. Unless it decides to move, we're stuck. - Screw that. I'm gonna blast our way out. (cannons zapping) - Hmm. Nope. - Dammit! - Kip, you bastard. I'm coming for you. - I'd like to see you try. - How dare you speak to me that way? - Aw. What are you gonna do about it? You'll see soon enough. - Get ready for takeoff. - And now you die. (cannons zapping) - [Computer] Nav systems up. (Jackie laughs) - You see, you can't shoot it from inside, but outside it's a different story. (cannons zapping) - Huh. Jackie, you are the greatest. - Yay. Let's go. (engines roaring) - No! (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) - Whoa! (metal clanking) - [Guardian] Warning. The Deepstar is protected property. You have 30 seconds to vacate the area. - No problem. (lasers zapping) (Taylor yells) So much for 30 seconds! - [Guardian] You now have 20 seconds to vacate the area. (gun zapping) (lasers zapping) You now have 10 seconds to vacate the area. Your non-compliance is unfortunate. (lasers zapping) (Taylor yells) (Taylor groans) I am now authorized to take action. - Hey, rust bucket! - [Guardian] Warning. The Deepstar is protected property. (explosion booming) (Taylor groans) (tense, brooding music) - Can I sit? (tense, brooding music) Why didn't you kill me when you had the chance? - It's not my style. - Yeah? Would you have left Nina and Dykstra behind, too? - Yeah. In pieces. (Wade chuckles) - Then why me? - Because we both suffered the same loss, and I think, deep down, you're a decent guy. Deep, (groans) deep down. - Hey, I wanna offer you a deal. We find that treasure, we split it. (dramatic music) Hey, hey, hey, hey! - [Daniel] Greetings, my friends. - Are you injured? - Who are you? - We mean you no harm. - We apologize for the guardian. It is a defense system for the Deepstar. Unfortunately, we are unable to shut it down. - You were on the Deepstar? - Yes. We crashed 20 years ago. - You don't look like you've been roughing it. - Let us take you to our camp. We'll explain everything there. - Lead the way. (brooding music) We have a deal. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) So you've lived here the whole time? - Yes. - But it doesn't look like- - Don't move! - I'd listen to her if I was you. She'd like nothing more than to blow your brains out. - Drop your weapon. Or don't. I'm good either way. (brooding music) - I knew I could count on you. So, tell me, who are your new friends? - Survivors of the Deepstar. - Is that so? Anyone else survive the crash? - Just us. Good, then you can tell me where the treasure is, because I looked all over this dump. I haven't seen anything. - We moved the treasure. - Where to? - In a cave. - [Dykstra] Where is the cave? - It's a mile west of here. - That's about where we landed the ship. - Good. - Let's go for a little walk. (dramatic music) - Jackie, I want you to stay with the ship. Keep the engines warm. - I wanna help you. - This is my fight, and I need you to keep the ship ready to blast off. - Dykstra's not the type of guy just to let you go. He will come after you. - I won't give him that opportunity. (dramatic music continues) - We're the first people you've seen since you've crashed? - That is correct. - Why are you so calm? - What do you mean? - Well, if I hadn't seen another human in a very long time, I'd be overflowing with excitement. I would assume I was being rescued. - What do we need to be rescued from? - [Taylor] Well, for starters, the three people forcing us by gunpoint to a cave. - There's nothing to worry about. - Everything will be beautiful. You will see. (dramatic music) (thunder cracking) (computer beeping) (engines whirring) (thrusters blasting) (feet shuffling) (stones clattering) - Why did you stop? - We have arrived. - Where is the treasure? - Right here. - I don't see anything. Why don't you go and check? - You go and check. - No, you go and check. - (scoffs) Fine. You're such a baby. There's nothing there. Let me see your flashlight. (gasps) - Behold. - (screams) Help! Help me! - Bask in its beauty. (Nina screaming) - [Nina] Help! Help me! - Screw this. (screams) (Nina screaming) (flesh squelching) - Oh god! - I am the true treasure of the universe. - What I eat I can become. - You should not be afraid. The pain is fleeting. It is truly wonderful. Come to us. Come to us. Come to us! - [Taylor] Run! - Jackie, no matter how this turns out, thanks. - I'm just sorry I got you in this mess. - Don't apologize. We made a good team. Taylor and I haven't let anybody in our lives in a long time. I guess you're kind of family. - (chuckles) How touching. - Where's my daughter? - Well, I'm afraid she didn't make it. - No! (gun blasts) - Kip! You monster! - Hey! Get us out of here now. - Let go of me. - Do it or I kill him. - Do it. - [Dykstra] Go! (Taylor gasping) (Taylor screams) - You think you can run from a god? I was asleep, but now I'm awake, and I'm hungry. If it's any solace, you'll live forever. - Is this where I'm supposed to realize immortality is within my reach? Succumb to its embrace? - Yeah. I'm with her. You gotta be out your fricking mind if you have me go back there. - It's not about making you go back. It's about giving me time to come forward. (ominous music) (creature growling) - (screams) Oh god! (pensive music) - I spent the last year searching for the Deepstar. A bounty so big that the entire galaxy could be yours. It was all a lie. There was no treasure. I lost everything. - What do you know about loss? My daughter was all I had left. - You're so melodramatic. At least you'll see her soon. (dramatic music) (creature growling) (creature growling) (both groaning) (creature squeals) (creature growling) (both laughing) - It can't get out. - Yeah, that's kinda too bad. I was kinda hoping to kick its ass. - You wouldn't have been able to. Let's get outta here. - You, uh, forgot something. You dropped this. - What? No! Why? - You didn't let me finish my story. I couldn't stand my mother's screaming anymore, so I, I strangled her. I was just a kid, but it was my first kill. I learned it's what I do best. I killed my mom. Now I killed yours. Come on! (Taylor screams) (Wade grunts) (kick thuds) (Taylor groans) (punches thudding) (kick thuds) (punches thwacking) (creature growls) (dramatic music) (ship whooshing) - You. - How did you escape? - Nothing can quench my thirst for vengeance. Where's Kip? - He's busy right now. I had hoped to look into his eyes as the light left. Pity. I guess she'll have to do. (cannons zapping) - [Computer] Brace for impact. - Ow! (gun whirs) - That must be Elnora joining the party. - Figures you and Elnora would know each other. - I gave her the code to my ship, knowing she will find your body, owe me a favor. (cannons zapping) (explosion booming) Don't worry. The back of the ship is impenetrable. She'd have to attack from the side. (explosion booming) (cannons zapping) (punch thuds) (Wade groans) (creature growls) (dramatic music continues) (both grunt) (punch thuds) (creature growls) (punch thuds) (punch thwacks) (punches thudding) (cannons zapping) - - [Computer] Warning. Structurally impacts Shields at 72%. - Can we talk about this? - The time for talking is over. I will destroy you. I will rip your hair out- - Okay. - One by- (dramatic music continues) (punch thuds) (metal clanks) (steam hisses) (punches thwacking) (kick thuds) (creature growls) (both grunting) (Taylor grunts) (dramatic music continues) (ships whooshing) (dramatic music continues) - Okay. Let's go. (dramatic music continues) (punch thuds) (Dykstra groaning) (punches thwacking) (creature growls) (punches thwacking) (Taylor grunting) (creature growls) (Taylor yells) (Wade grunts) (ship whooshing) (cannons zapping) - [Computer] Evasive maneuvers. - Seriously? - [Computer] Shields at 61%. (cannons zapping) (computer beeping) - Oh yeah? (computer beeping) Try this. (cannons zapping) (Taylor grunting) (punches thwacking) (creature growls) (punches thwacking) (punches thudding) (punches thwacking) (cannons zapping) - [Computer] Shields at 54%. (Kip groans) (punches thwacking) (Kip groans) Shield unstable. (gun whirring) - I give. - And I'll take. (gun zapping) (cannons zapping) (dramatic music continues) - [Computer] Shields at 33% - Stupid! (dramatic music continues) - Okay. That's it. (both grunting) (flesh squelches) (Taylor groans) (electricity zapping) - Oh. I thought you'd be able to tell. (gun whirring) - Time to die, freak. (gun clicks) - It's not gonna work without this. (punch thuds) (creature growls) - Son of a... (creature growls) (Wade yells) How's that for some action? (creature growls) (Wade yelling) (Wade screams) (bones crunching) (flesh squelching) (cannons zapping) - (Computer) Shields unstable. - Jackie. - Oh, it's about time. (explosion booming) - Shields at 29%. - Elnora? - Yeah. I can't shake her. - [Computer] Shields at 11%. - Kip. So good to see you. - Elnora, can we just stop this? - You stole something from me. I won't stop, ever. - Okay. We'll stop. Full stop. - Aye aye, captain. (engines powering down) (Elnora screaming) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) - [Computer] Shields at 0%. - I'm probably gonna feel really weird about this later, but that felt pretty good. (Kip chuckles) (triumphant music) (dramatic music) (mom whimpering) - Mom? - Taylor! - Mom? - Ah, Taylor! (melancholy music) - I'm sorry, Mom. (triumphant music) (ship booms) - (laughs) Dad! - Kip, I'm so sorry about- - Taylor! - What? - Taylor! (Kip laughs) - Whoa! (Taylor laughs) Will you look at that. Hey! (triumphant music continues) - Dad. - Taylor. I thought I lost you. - I told you, I would never let that happen again. - What happened? Are you all right? - Mom. - Yes, honey. (Taylor gasps) (somber music) - Lacey! - No, that's not her. - How is this possible? (somber music continues) - I failed. - Oh, honey, you didn't fail. You fought hard, and you won, and you didn't give up. There isn't much time. The monster has never consumed pure essence before. I can feel it fighting. It can't control me, so it will destroy what's left. - Can you forgive me Lacey? - There's nothing to forgive. The most important thing you've ever done lives and breathes. You made the right decision to bring Taylor back. It wasn't her time yet. - I miss you so much. - Someday we'll be together again. I've been watching over you from a beautiful place, a place of love, and that's all I feel for you. There's no sadness. No regret. I'll return there and wait for you. - I love you. - I love you, Mom. - I love you both. (essence whirring) (Lacey whooshes) (bright music) - What happened? - Something. Taylor, you remember when we used to just jump in the ship and head out into deep space? - No maps, no plans. - Go wherever we want. - Back in the game, baby. (both laughing) - Is there room for one more? Yes. Come on. (bright music continues) Well, at least we got the parts we needed from their ship. - [Kip] It's gonna be great having a working hyperdrive again. - [Jackie] Ooh, can I drive? - [Kip] Don't touch that. - [Computer] Hyperjump in three, two, one. Jackie laughs (hyperdrive booms) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (dramatic music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues)
