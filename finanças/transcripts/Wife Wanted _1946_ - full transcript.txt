I've turned down two parts in the last week. Why? Because they weren't right for you. That's happened several times lately. Is it going to become a habit? Of course not. The right part will come along. Meanwhile, take it easy. You can coast for a while can't you? - I've saved some money. Look. It isn't easy just sitting around waiting for you to call me. That reminds me. Did you ever hear of Jeff Caldwell? I've seen his Ads. But frankly. At the moment, I'm not in the market nor in the mood to buy any real-estate. Listen. He phoned me this morning. He's looking for a partner to put some money in the business. He prefers a woman. Someone who knows everyone in Hollywood. Is that a new way of saying that I'm ..? - No, no. Now wait a minute. Now, a lot of picture people have made a lot of money in real-estate. Now Jeff is a live-wire. And I've got a hunch you two will mop up. Well, if I don't have to give up pictures entirely .. You leave pictures to me. I'll phone him right away. Thanks, Phil. Tell Miss Raymond I'll be happy to talk to her. Say tomorrow at four? Carole Raymond. Sincerely yours, Jeffrey Caldwell. The guy who put the sin in sincerely. And you had this chop book for five grand. He won't know that until he wakes up. Then it will be too late to yelp. By the way. This Miss Raymond who is barging in here. It couldn't be the Carole Raymond of the pictures, could it? Nobody else. She'll bring in a lot of money. And a lot of headaches. - Don't be silly. One other thing. I'm giving you more responsibility for running the friendship club next door. Do I rate congratulations or condolences? I can be identified with it in certain cases but .. As a general rule it is not too good for these real-estate deals. You wouldn't be fixing it for little Nola Reed to take the rap .. If that phony club ever backfires would you, Jeff? I can't understand it. Always suspicious. I've seen enough of matrimonial and friendship clubs .. To be suspicious of everything, darling. Oh, by the way. Start checking on Agnes. See how she's doing. As a matter of fact you might as well bring her whole list up to date. Alright. And you first met her at a friendship club? I never would have believed it. She was so sweet. Anyway, they robbed me of every cent I had in the world. Young lady, this should be a lesson to you. Do you realize that the man you met at that social club .. and married .. Is a murderer? You might have been his next victim. Hello. Hello. Is this Agnes? But you don't know me. But they gave me your phone number down at the Harbor Social Club. I know you are just gorgeous and your voice is so sweet. "How's about getting acquainted?" Why sure, honey. Come right on over. Just knock three times and then twice. Gee, I love you hear you talk. What a fascinating voice. Say, what's your name? My name is Hector. Hector? That's cute. I used to have a dog named Hector. Say, don't waste any time getting over. You hear, Heck? I told you. I don't even want to talk to you. Take it easy, Miss Sheldon. Just dropped in to say that we missed you over at the friendship club lately. You've got your nerve. After introducing me to that .. that creature. Now get out of here before I call the police. Maybe you'd like me to show them this picture when they get here? Oh. Oh no. Where did that picture come from? It's a filthy horrible trick. If it makes the front pages everybody will agree it's quite a trick, honey. Anyone who knows me will take my work that never happened. But it did. We got hold of a picture of him and one of you. And then turned them over to our very talented photographer. What an imagination he's got. Alright. How much? Apiece of art like this is worth say .. Five hundred. Naturally, we'll keep the negative. Just in case you decide to make a fuss. Isn't it wonderful. And to think. This came from meeting at the friendship club just one week ago. Oh well. I'm always breaking my own track record, sweetheart. But when I see anything I want. I get it. There is nothing slow about Arthur J Mayfield. Oh, I love you so. Say that again, darling. I said there is nothing slow about Arthur J Mayfield. That's what you think you big half-witted jerk. Get it all? Every word of it, baby. You are a genius making that sap repeat his name. Make a duplicate record for our files. We'll take this one down to his office tomorrow and serenade him with it. How big a tap will he go for? - Oh, a couple of thousand at least. I've seen his wife. It probably never occurred to him that a telephone conversation can be recorded. Nothing occurs to those guys. That's why they haunt the friendship clubs. And that makes us partners, Miss Raymond. Fifty-fifty. Frankly, $15,000 is peanuts. But your name and your contacts will be extremely valuable for the new firm. So now I start selling real-estate? And start making a real fortune. Your office will be next door. By the way, I'm anxious to have you meet Lee Kirby. Who's he? A prospect? No. One of my associates. He is in New York now. Won't he be startled to see you've taken on a completely inexperienced partner? Oh no. Lee trusts my judgement absolutely. He's a grand guy. Well partner, let's shake hands on the deal. Good afternoon Miss Nola, dearie. Nice to see you. Likewise I'm sure. Nice going, Agnes. Here is your share. Fifty percent. You must be good for a few hundred more. You are not kidding. Va-va-voom. You know our rules. Never take a check. Take it back and make the chump cash it. But I thought .. - No buts. You heard me. Listen you. If you can't make him come across with more than that .. I won't give you another sucker. Listen, Jeff. Women are poison. They're alright in their place but their place isn't inside a business like ours. I don't even like Nola handling the friendship club for us. You never knew how to handle women, Lee. - Nobody knows how to handle women. Look. I come back and find you've made a movie actress a full partner. Isn't that being a little stupid? - No. You are being a little stupid if you can't see how we can use Carole Raymond. She's already dug up two of her playmates and they've invested $30,000. If that's being stupid I'll take some more of the same. Sure. In real-estate. Wait until she tumbles to the friendship club racket of ours next door. She'll squawk louder than the suckers we take. You just let me lead the parade the way I've always done. All you've got to do is fall in line and keep in step. I've already paved the way. She admires me tremendously for being a philanthropist. Jeffrey Caldwell the big real-estate man who simply loves to make people happy. Good morning. Did you lose something? I'm just straightening things up. Thank you but I don't really need a secretary. I don't happen to be a secretary to you. But I am associated with Mr Caldwell. Then we are all together. How nice. It has been. Up to now. I think I see what you mean. Well Lee, I'm very happy that everything went off so well in New York. I beg your pardon. - Come right in, Carole. Thank you. May I present Mr Lee Kirby. Carole Raymond - Lee. - How do you do. - Mr Kirby. I've been telling Lee he ought to meet a real real-estate salesman. She's got everything. - I can see that. Jeff has told me about the new business you brought in, Miss Raymond. Pure luck. I just happened to know some people who wanted to invest and .. Jeff had the properties. - It's grand to have you with us now. Sooner or later I hope you and I can concentrate on something together. I have to run along so I'll see you both later. Goodbye. Thank you, Mr Kirby. - So long. Well, I .. Seem to have made a hit with everybody except the young lady next door. Just who is she, Jeff? Your secretary? Oh, you've met Nola? She is all wrapped up in the friendship club. She resents the time I put in on other things. What connection has she with the real-estate end of it? None. Outside of her natural interest in my success. My interest is in real-estate. I'm going to stick to it. And I suggest that you tell Miss Reed to stick to her friendship club. Why, what's wrong with the club? - Nothing. Nothing at all, I'm sure. But I'll have no part of it. Particularly if Walter Desmond is a sample of its membership. Oh, Desmond. He just happened to blunder in there first. Not a bad fellow at all. Just got off on the wrong foot. He certainly did with me. You know, I think that you'd better put Mr Kirby on him. Maybe he can make him concentrate on real-estate. Listen, Carole. It's a cinch you'll run into lots of that. Fellows reaching for you before they are reaching for their fountain pens. But you can handle them alright. Look .. Desmond has got a bankroll. He is interested in my place out at the Palisades. It's a $40,000 deal. Don't fade out on me now. If I only thought that he was just in love with me I could handle him. But do you know, I have a feeling he is trying to pump me. You see. He is trying to find out something that puzzles him. Well, you can't tell him something you know nothing about. Anyway, he wants to look at the property tonight. Take him out there. Close the deal. Then you can say goodbye. - Well, alright. But I'd better watch myself going around the curves. You know, it's quite a setting, there. Mountains. Moonlight. The ocean. Wish me luck. - I do, Carole. Loads of luck. Well, here is the house, Mr Desmond. Jeff said there was an outside switch somewhere on the right side of the door. There it is. Here is the key. Would you open it please. Thank you. I've not been here before so I guess we have to just sort-of stumble around. Here are the lights. Fine. Well. This is the hall. There is the staircase leading to the upper part of the house. And. This is the living room. Shall we go in? A good size room you see. Right there is the fireplace. And. That door there leads out to the patio. This house was rather famous for the view of the Palisades. It is lovely. Hey, what's this? "Let me be host as you two drink a toast to the closing of the deal." "Jeffrey Caldwell." It is almost a poem. What a thoughtful touch. Yes, isn't it. A laugh to Jeffrey is just one .. Touch after another, isn't it. That sounds like a puzzle. Well. What do you think of the place? I like the place, Carole. I like it very much. But only as a setting for you. What? Carole, I believe in shortcuts. I've been crazy about you from the moment Jeff introduced us. Let's stick to business please, Mr Desmond. I work for a living. A woman as lovely as you are shouldn't work at anything. Except perhaps, making herself happy. I'm in love with you. - Mr Desmond. Please. Oh, it's like that. Carole, how much do you think you and your crooked partner have taken me for? What do you mean? We're just trying to sell you a house. Surely nothing crooked in that? Oh stop acting. You're a come-on for Jeff Caldwell. I know it and you know it. Here is what you want from me. A certified cashier's check for $40,000. I had it all prepared for you. Given the circumstances .. - I don't know what you talk about. Oh no. Cute of you to plant that bottle of champagne. Hardly worthy of you. I haven't the faintest idea of what you are trying to tell me. You haven't? I suppose there was nothing crooked about that Arizona oil deal? That swindle cost me just $50,000. How about that girl from the friendship club who tried to blackmail me? I suppose that wasn't a part of your frame-up? I don't know what you're talking about, if you believe me or not, Mr Desmond. Carole, why pretend? I wanted you. And I didn't care what it cost me. Can't you understand that? I'm going to call Jeff Caldwell and tell him to come down here. To explain a few things. Why? It doesn't really matter very much now, does it? Mr Desmond, I wasn't able to .. Please. Will you try Mr Caldwell again? I've got to see him. - Sorry Miss. I've been telling you .. He hasn't been in his room all evening. Is there any message? No. No. Never mind. Nice going. "Club man in suicide leap." Has anybody called? - No. But Carole Raymond is waiting to see you. Good morning, Carole. How did it go last night? - Jeff. Jeff, where have you been? I have been .. Tell me exactly what happened. - I have told you. All I know is that when I couldn't get you I came back and Desmond was gone. Looked over the rail. Saw his body on the rocks. Just an accident? You say he only had two glasses of wine? - Well, he certainly wasn't drunk. I just can't understand it, Jeff. I can't understand it. Well he must have been drinking earlier. The police will discover it. Anyway, you let me handle this. There is nothing to it. Oh yes there is. Something I haven't mentioned. Oh? What's that? Jeff. Just what was going on between you and Desmond? He claims he was robbed by this office and accused me of being in on the deal. I'm going to mention that fact during the investigation. Oh no you're not. You're going to say exactly what I tell you to say. Or I might suggest to the D. A. that you pushed him over the cliff. What? Who do you suppose will believe that? Maybe nobody. But movie producers won't fight to sign you up after such a scandal, will they? You know, I think you would put me on the spot. [ Telephone ] Hello? Oh yes, Mr Toland. I'll tell him right away. The District Attorney wants to see you immediately. "Okay. I'll take care of it." As I say, you just sit tight and let me handle it. The whole thing will blow over and we'll be right back where we started. Oh no. I'm getting out. - I'm sorry? But you are my partner. I couldn't bear to take your name off the door just now. Listen, Jeff. I don't care what you did before, but I won't be mixed up in your crooked deals. Let's be realistic. Since you joined us I've put over quite a few crooked deals. As my partner, you are already mixed up in them. Now I can handle them and keep you out of it providing you play ball. If you don't, you're ruined. No matter what happens. Jeff, all I want is my $15,000. I'll step out. After all, the money I brought into this office was honest. And I'm going to promote you for doing it. From now on my dear, you are also a partner in the friendship club. You have some talents I can use in that line very, very profitably. I wouldn't be in the same county as that dirty racket. Then you'll be in the county jail trying to explain .. Why you were with Walter Desmond a few minutes before he died. The D.A. just called. I'm going down there now. Yes. I am going with you. I'll tell him the truth. Tell him just how rotten the Caldwell enterprise is. Yes? What is it? That's what I'm wondering. There's a newspaper man on the phone who insists on talking to you. Tell him I'll call back. Try to remember, Jeff. She drives men to suicide. Do what I tell you. Get in touch with me tomorrow. Don't force me to get in touch with you. And then the police found the body on the rocks. All broken. Terrible, isn't it. When you called me I couldn't believe it. What was he doing at your place at that time of the night? That's just the thing I can't understand. As I told you, he called at the office yesterday afternoon. He said he wanted to look the place over. I gave him the keys. Why he waited until last night to go out is beyond me. He was a pretty heavy drinker, Mr Toland. Yes, yes. I know. We found an empty champagne bottle and several glasses. But only one of them had been used. We tried to find out if he had been expecting a visitor. Or if someone had been with him and left after the .. Suicide or accident. Or whatever happened. Well I guess it's just one of those things. He was to come in today and close the deal. I wish I could help you more, sir. Well, thanks for coming in. We'll call you at the office if we need you. Alright. Turn down that jukebox. Yes, Miss Raymond. How did I get here? Well, you've been here about three hours. I have? Okay. Fill her up. Why don't you eat this sandwich? - I don't want to eat. Maybe a good night's sleep would help. I couldn't sleep. You think I am .. - Not exactly. I'm going to hold up some fingers. Tell me, how many are there? Two. That's fine. But I'm still glad you're not driving your car. Well, that's settled. Go on. Be a good guy. Miss Raymond, you're in trouble. Why don't you tell me? Because I can't tell anybody. Like a pilot way up high there. The engine conks out. He forgot his parachute. If you tell me, I think I could help you more than this. You are a real friend, Toby. Thank you. That's what I always say, what this world needs is more friendship. Friendship. Yeah. That's my whole trouble. I've got too much friendship. I'm mixed up with a friendship club that is just crawling with friendship. At least, they're crawling anyway. Come on, make it a double. Well thank you, Mr Caldwell. We're just doing a little checking. A matter of routine. No. That's all. Thanks. Yes, Mr Cornell? Tell the city desk I'm putting Bill Tyler on a special assignment. He won't be available for a couple of days. Yes, sir. Did the guy spill anything? I got more from what he didn't say than from what he did. Listen Bill, he admitted Desmond was in his friendship club. Just once, as he put it. And then only very briefly. Well, he'd hardly admit that the dead man was a regular sucker. Bill, the minute I got Desmond's brother on long-distance. I got a hunch there is a whale of a yarn buried in this somewhere. So if you want to catch a whale you send for a bloodhound. Meaning me. - Precisely. What did the brother say? He said suicide was out. Desmond told him he was falling in love. In love one day. Dead the next. Well boss, that's life in sunny Southern California for you. Did the brother have any idea who the woman was? No. Desmond told him he met a lot of swell numbers at some friendship club. That's when I got busy. When I found out that Caldwell, in whose house he died, runs a friendship club. This all adds up. What's the D.A.s office doing? I don't want any interference when I get going. No. You're okay there. They're writing it off as suicide. They've wanted to give these social clubs a going-over for a long time. So I promised them if we came up with any connection, I'd tip them off. Now get going. Boss. I'm gone. Oh, boss. Tell the cashier to stand by for an SOS. Spending on saps is tough on the expense account. Is this your first trip west? West of Hollywood and Vine, yes. Any Indians lurking around? Well, I can dig you up a few if you're interested. Maybe later. Right now you can bring me some giggle water and scram out of here. I got to send me up a smoke signal. - Thank you. Give me Ardmore 5-5-5-8-4 please. Hello, Chief? You're right about phoning your home instead of the office. Where are you staying? "Well, I'm at the Hotel Bristol, room 701." Yeah. Right now you're talking to a big-time sheep rancher from Utah. I'm going to drop in at the Hollywood branch of the friendship club. Where a guy can find his future wife. "Or a horse." "Don't forget to tell the cashier to stand by for an SOS." What's it for this time? Sheep herder on salary, naturally. I'll need a lot of lettuce for the lambs I'm going to run around with. From now on. Mildred Hayes. What are you doing here? Why, don't you remember? I hope you're not angry. Of course I'm not angry. But. I don't remember very much about anything last night. Did I run into you somewhere? It's been almost 3 years since I've seen you, isn't it? It is. And you were wonderful to me then. Insisting that I get that bit part in your picture. That wasn't anything. How did you happen to come here? I wandered into Toby's. He's a swell sympathetic guy to tell your troubles to. He pointed you out at the bar and asked me to take you home. Yeah. Pretty ashamed of myself. I hadn't eaten anything all day. But you're right about Toby. I must have bored him stiff. You were very kind to me last night, Miss Raymond. I'm in an awful lot of trouble and .. Well, you told me I could come here and stay until things straightened out. If you don't remember, I'll run along. No, of course you won't. Whatever I said last night still goes. Haven't you any place to live? I'm not going to inflict myself on you another minute. Besides, you have troubles enough of your own I imagine. At least I'm not broke and I've got a roof over my head. No. You're going to stay here. Now I know what that old saying means. "Misery loves company." What's wrong, honey? Oh, Miss Raymond. I haven't a cent in the world. I've been put out of the room I had. I don't even know a friend I can turn to. Ah now. Never cry before breakfast. Come on now. We're going to scramble up some food and we'll both feel a whole lot better. Come along. We'll have a long heart-to-heart talk. You think you've got troubles? Wait until you get an earful of mine. May I ..? - Why, certainly. Of course, he might come back. They sometimes do. Well, did things get rather serious between you two, Mrs Rutheridge? Oh yes. Desperately so, Miss Reed. He had such a beautiful voice. You remember his voice? How it sounded? A singing voice? - Oh no. Speaking. His tones. So vibrant. He said things that just .. Just shattered me, Miss Reed. You do look a little shattered. Of course I prefer a man with hair. But somehow you forgot that Otis was so terribly bald. When he talked. Didn't you? Mr Caldwell will be upset to see things turned out as they did with you and .. Otis, Mrs Rutheridge. Considering you became acquainted through our club. But, better luck next time. Oh yes. I'm still young. Oh. Do you think I ought to prosecute him for stealing my automobile? Well, if you're sure he did it and you know where he went with it. Oh well, it was an old car anyway. Well, I'll drop in from time to time. Goodbye now. Goodbye Mrs Rutheridge. Oh. Excuse me, ma'am. I didn't mean to bump into you. - Don't mention it. May I help you? - I reckon you can, Miss. I phoned you yesterday. My name is Bill Tyler. Oh yes, of course. Won't you sit down? Thank you, ma'am. You are the man from .. Utah, ma'am. What part? - A few miles out of Kanab. And you are in the sheep business? Do you have a large ranch? Well, it's large enough for my sheep. I don't want to seem inquisitive, Mr Tyler. But to protect our club members we must investigate all applicants closely. Do you operate on a large scale? Well ma'am, you might say I'm quite an operator. Anything else? No. Mr Caldwell gets all the details. I told him you were coming in. "Yes?" Mr Bill Tyler from Utah is here for his appointment. Oh. Alright. I will see him in just a minute. Listen, Lee. Were any records kept that might connect Mr Desmond with our real-estate scheme? Sure. The best records in the world. - Where are they? Right where I keep all our records. Any deals with Desmond before you began needling him into buying your place. Were entirely verbal. Now let me ask you one. - Well? Desmond was supposed to get a $40,000 certified check the day of the suicide. What happened to it? - I haven't any idea. Why? Just wondering. Just the old partner asking, you know. Oh, wait a minute. The big sheep-rancher from Utah. Sounds like money. Sounds like a lamb being led to the slaughter. I'm going to have you meet him. Send Mr Tyler in please. It's a pretty sordid story isn't it. Want to tell me the rest? It should be easy to guess. Alright. Let's say I do guess. Darling. Let's not talk about it anymore. And don't you worry. I'm glad I found you last night. Because then I .. I didn't think there was any way out. Except one. And that's the wrong way. It doesn't end troubles. It just makes greater ones for other people. I didn't tell you that I met him at a friendship club. That's when they got my money too. What little I had. I went back and asked them for it but they threw me out. How could you ever happen to go to a club like that? I was lonesome. But why did you give them your money? - Because that's the way they operate. You will be very happy you came here to see us, Mr Tyler. But Mr Caldwell, don't you think I ought to .. Phone this Miss Raymond before I meet her tonight? That isn't necessary. Let us arrange it for you. You can count on her being there. She's a very charming person, Mr Tyler. Well I sure hope that I can act at least intelligent. I know she's going to like you. Well, I'll get in touch with you at your hotel tomorrow. Well, I'll run along, Mr Caldwell. Thanks a lot. - Don't mention it. Goodbye. Oh, how to pull the wool over a sheep-rancher's eyes. I'm not so sure. He's not so dumb as he looks. Are you kidding? If ever anybody was ripe for shearing .. That's it. Did you see the bills in his wallet when he took out his card? Yes. But there is something phony about him. I have a hunch. Let me handle the hunches round here, Nola. They have kept us out of trouble so far. Now get me Carole Raymond. You have such interesting hunches lately. Connected with her. [ Telephone ] Hello? Hello Jeff. What? Alright. I'll meet him. Of course I don't like it but I know when I'm licked. Certainly you were. You can count on me. You know, I never thought I'd never speak to that man again. I'm sorry, Miss Raymond. You seem a little bored. Really? What makes you think I am? Oh, I'm pretty much a flat tire as a conversationalist. There's a heap of difference between this crowded nightclub .. And a lonely sheep ranch in Utah. I'm much more accustomed to talking to a fat old ewe than a .. Beautiful young ewe. Ouch. That was pretty bad, Mr Tyler. As a matter of fact I'm not a bit bored. But I am rather surprised. In what way, ma'am? Frankly, I .. Can't understand how a man like you .. Attractive, fun. Came all the way from Utah to California to .. Find a wife. I really came here on business, ma'am. Then I became lonesome and .. Happened to hear about your friendship club. Not my friendship club. I just work for it. Well, as I was saying, I heard about it anyway. Since I met you through it. From now on, it's aces with me. Thank you. You know. I was almost sorry for you. You expected to meet the girl of your dreams tonight. Hmm. And all you met was me. Say, seeing as I'm a club member in good standing, you're not very encouraging. I must be boring you. Let's see how good I am at dancing. Alright. I'm sorry I wasn't too encouraging at the table. That's alright, ma'am. Say, I'm going to call you Carole. I've a hunch that even though you work for one .. You feel as I do about these friendship clubs. And just how do we feel? I very nearly didn't contact Caldwell after something I read in the papers. What do you mean? About a guy named Walter Desmond. Didn't you read it? He committed suicide. There was a rumor it was over some woman he met in one of those friendship clubs. What's the matter, ma'am? Did I step on your toes? No. But I would rather not dance anymore. Then let's go to the bar. Tell me more, Bill. I like to hear more about your ranch. Listen, Carole. If I didn't know you .. I'd think you worked for the Income Tax people the way you pump me. But don't think I'm not grateful, because I am. And I understand. Understand what? The reason you're so tactful. I'm just a Utah yokel and I don't know how to talk to beautiful women. So you get me yapping on the only subject I know anything about. You are a very beautiful woman, Carole. And somehow I'm beginning to regret you doing what you are. Yes. So am I. But I like you, Bill. You're a nice guy. Why won't you go back to Utah before you get hurt? When I am just beginning to live? Listen, I'm going to take you home now. Tomorrow, we will start getting really acquainted. No, Bill. I'm not going to see you tomorrow. Or any other time. You go on home and .. Forget all about me. Sorry, but I can't get train reservations except for two. I'm going to see you again, and like it. And I hope you do too. Edgar, what was the name of that piece you were playing? "There wasn't a moon until I looked into your eyes." And that's the set-up as of now, chief. I'm a sheep-ranch Casanova and the girl is already beginning to fall for me. And who do you suppose she is? None other than Carole Raymond the movie star. Maybe that won't look good in the headlines when I crack this story. "Yeah. I'm positive she knows something about Desmond's death." "I'll get it out of her if I have to marry her." Oh, boss. I want you to run a little item in tomorrow's paper. Reading something like this. Alright. Go ahead. What was that? Great. This is all we needed. Where could they get such a tip? Straight from the mouth of a bottle. What are you talking about? - Are you kidding? Your new playmate, Carole Raymond. Toby said she was on that bender the other night. She was. I wonder if she's talked to anybody else besides Toby. When are you going to learn there is only one woman you can trust? Your wife. And if you try any more smart stuff .. I'll tell the whole world that I am Mrs Jeffrey Caldwell. Will you act your age. I am, and it's not the age of innocence. Do you think you're putting something over on me? You're not falling for this dime-store edition of a woman are you? Don't be stupid. Carole Raymond is simply useful to my plans. Well she is beginning to interfere with some of mine. Nola, will you quit it. This could be a bad jam. Now listen. Are you sure there's nothing in our club files connecting us with Walter Desmond? Well, only this. Oh. I forgot about her. Get rid of that picture. Do you know where she is now? I thought the idea was to keep her away from here. After the scene she made trying to get her money back and asked to see Desmond. The idea now is to find her, and quick. The way things stand she can be more damaging than Carole Raymond. That's what you think. How do you feel? Things always seem a little better in daylight than at night. How about driving down to the beach? - That would be fun. We can stop off for luncheon at the hot-dog stand. What's the matter? Mildred, tell me. That was the man. Walter Desmond? - Yes. Now they are looking for me. They'll make me tell the whole terrible story. I'll be in all the newspapers. Carole, what can I do? Who introduced you to Desmond? A man named Jeffrey Caldwell. Caldwell? Does Caldwell know what happened? I don't know. I went to his office. I was hysterical. I wanted my money back. I wanted to force him to make Walter Desmond help me. Caldwell wouldn't even see me. His secretary told me that if I ever came back they'd have me arrested. I saw Desmond on the street one day and I told him that .. He called me a blackmailer. Now wait. Does Caldwell know where you are or how to find you? How could he? No-one knows I'm here. Mildred, I can't explain now but .. It's not very clear to me. Would you be willing to help me if I could find a way out for both of us? I don't understand. Now listen carefully. If it meant breaking up a racket .. That gets helpless girls out of the same sort of awful spot that you're in. If it means helping me out of trouble. Would you be willing to tell your story to the police? If it will help you? - Yes. What do you want me to do? - Nothing now. I don't want you to answer the phone. I don't want you to leave this apartment or answer the doorbell. Promise? - Of course. [ Doorbell ] You wait here. Miss Carole Raymond? Thank you. It's nice to have someone send you flowers like that. Someone nice sent them. I'm glad he did too. He'll be very important in my little scheme of .. [ Telephone ] You see. Hello? Yes .. I was wondering when you were going to call, Jeff. Listen, Carole. I want to see you immediately. Never mind what. I'll tell you when you get here. Just how much did she spill to Tyler last night? She really didn't spill anything but I had a hunch she was on the verge of it. Anyway, as a cupid bringing lovers together, you're a flop. She told Tyler to forget about her and go on back to his sheep ranch. He can go back alright but not until he's sunk some dough in Arizona Oil. And you know who's going to set up that little deal? - Me? No. Carole Raymond. Whether she likes it or not. I'll call you in when it's all set. In the meantime, keep your eye on her. Who is kidding who? When did you get the tip about the woman that Desmond met at a friendship club? Well frankly, that's only a plant. Tyler told me to run. I don't know what it will lead to, if anything. Oh. Oh, you've put Bill on the story? Well, he's a good reporter alright. He's helped us out many times before. Yes, and the minute he digs up anything where your office fits into the picture. I'll notify you immediately. - Swell. If I know anything about the way these friendship club rats operate. He'll need help. And need it quick. Those are the details. Plus your part in selling the idea to Tyler. Any objections, Carole? He's not a bad guy, Jeff. Are you sure this Arizona deal is a good oil prospect? I wouldn't want him to lose his money. - I've got a lot of my own dough in it. Is that good enough? Yes. I .. I guess it is. You see, Jeff. As long as you don't insist that I play your friendship club game. I don't mind working with you on deals that are legitimate. Now you're using your head. You know, Carole. You and I could do a lot of things together. Yes Jeff. We .. We could. But. What about her? Nola. Don't worry about her. Naturally, I have to use certain .. Friendly tactics, but that has got nothing to do with you and me. Bill, you dance beautifully. Thank you, Carole. You remind me of this song. "There wasn't a moon until I looked into your eyes." My hat please. - Yes, sir. May I help you? That's quite a compliment. Coming from a sheep-rancher who says he doesn't know how to talk to women. You make the words come easy. Now, if you'd only go back to Utah with me I'd try to repay you. I'd like to show you the most marvellous moon that ever climbed into the sky. We have rather a gorgeous moon out here. Let's go and compare it with yours. Well, what do you think of our moon? Better than ours alright. But it depends on who is looking at it. Bill. When are you going back to Utah? That depends on you too. The way you described it, you .. Must have a very big ranch. - Hundreds of acres. I like land too. Oddly enough, I'm just about to invest in some. Ranch land or business property? Neither. It's oil land. Well you can get rich quick or go broke quick in oil. Are you sure it's okay? I think so. The man who is handling the deal is quite reputable. An oil promoter? No, he's a real-estate agent. His name is Lee Kirby. I've met him. He was with Caldwell at the friendship club the first time I went there. That's a coincidence, isn't it. If it isn't a secret, ma'am, where is this oil land located? Well it's .. It's a tract that he stumbled on in Arizona. The man who owns it won't sell in small units. I hope that I can raise enough money to take care of my share. I'm only a baby when it comes to oil but .. If there is anything I can do to help you. Bill. Maybe you'd go with me tomorrow when I see Kirby. Why, sure. As a matter of fact, I haven't mentioned it before but .. One of the reasons I came to Los Angeles was .. To look around for something good to invest in. What disillusionment. And I thought you came here to scout around for a wife. And wouldn't it be marvellous if I found both wrapped in the same package. I think we had better drive back. Sure. But I sure hate to leave. You and the moon are rather irresistible. Thank you, Bill. Hello darling. Still awake? What's the matter? You look troubled. I've been puzzled ever since this morning. Trying to figure out some of the things you've said. You will understand. One day. You know, it's strange, Mildred. Sometimes you set out to act a part and then .. All of a sudden you're not acting. Which all adds up to exactly zero, so far. But the characters are shaping up and very soon the plot will begin to unfold. And you think it leads to the death of Walter Desmond? It can't lead anywhere else. We know that Caldwell operates both the real-estate office and the club racket. We know Desmond got interested in real-estate .. After he had first got interested in the girl in the racket. Somewhere along the line something went wrong. And Desmond ends up on a slab in the morgue. Now the same mob are giving me the business. Caldwell, Kirby and Carole Raymond. Who is Kirby? A guy who will fit a number 9 pair of handcuffs when I get through with him. Got a little job for you, Squint. Take this one-column, four-inch item. Our of the oil news section. And insert this copy. That's easy. When do you want it? No later than 4 o'clock this afternoon. And don't touch anything else on this page. Okay, I'll have it ready for you, Kirby. - Right. But she would certainly leave some form of forwarding address. Yes. Very well. Thank you. Was that about Mildred Hayes? - Yes. I've checked every possible place in town. She's just disappeared. I don't like any part of it. That newspaper item is proof there is a leak somewhere. The more I think of it. The more I believe it's this Hayes girl. Of course it couldn't be Carole Raymond? Will you leave here out of this? Whenever you will. Nola, you are beginning to get in my hair. Carole Raymond is playing ball. This is no time for jealousy. We must find this other girl. I'll tell you what I have done. I'm suspicious of your sheep-herder, Bill Tyler. So I wired our Salt Lake City branch to check in to him. Will you stop trying to think for me. I tell you the man is alright. Your job is to find Mildred Hayes so we can shut her up. She might start talking about Walter Desmond. Now get busy. I'll be home before dinner. - That means you go out again tonight? I may. Why? Are you afraid to be alone? I do get frightened when I'm here alone. I guess my nerves are getting .. - I know. Now look. I'll telephone you at 4:30 sharp. Don't answer any other calls, will you. - Alright, Carole. I'll be waiting. - That's a good girl. Bye. But Mr Kirby. It's funny with the proven oil lands all around it that .. This area would be undeveloped. Mr Kirby explained to me to hat .. This acreage is owned by an eccentric old man. And to be brutally frank, he doesn't know what he's got. What proof is there that there is oil there? Oh, there is no doubt that there is oil there. My own geologist says so. And now I own an option on the land the Amalgamated wants. Then why do you want to let Miss Raymond here in on the deal, Mr Kirby? Because I need additional cash. You see, I've already raised $50,000. My option requires a payment of $60,000 by the end of this week. That's where I come in. If I can put up $10,000. But on what basis? Well. I'd be willing to let Miss Raymond have, say .. Twenty percent of the sale price. Once I negotiate the deal with Amalgamated. The sale price could be as high as a million dollars. I'm afraid that lets me out. You see, I can only raise $3,500 Mr Kirby. Now wait a minute, Mr Kirby. Suppose I come in on it with Miss Raymond? Make up the additional $6,500. That would be very generous of you. But we've got to move fast. My option expires the end of this week. I'd like to close the deal say, tomorrow. Okay. I'll wire my Utah bank to transfer that amount the first thing tomorrow. Oh Bill, that is very kind of you. Well. Maybe. But Mr Tyler stands to make a big profit on his investment. Once I hook Amalgamated. Can we call it a deal then? It will be if you'll have the cash in my office by noon tomorrow. Well Carole, I reckon this calls for some sort of a celebration. Shall we make it for dinner again tonight? I guess that's the least I can do after the way you've helped me. See you tomorrow, Mr Kirby. - You won't regret this, Mr Tyler. Goodbye, Mr Kirby. - Goodbye. Forget the letter for a minute. See if you can get Kirby on the phone. He and Carole should have Tyler wrapped up by now. He doesn't answer. Funny. He knew I'd be calling. Try Carole. She ought to be home by this time. [ Telephone ] Hello? Oh Carole, I knew you wouldn't forget me. Hello. Who is this? Why, it's Mildred. "Mildred? Mildred who?" Carole? Carole, isn't this you? Hello? Hello? How quaint and original. Who was that? So, our beautiful Carole Raymond is playing ball, is she? Then what is our little chum Mildred Hayes doing at her apartment? That girl? Why, it couldn't be. I recognised her voice. She even mentioned her name. Now that I think of it. Carole did change her tune rather abruptly yesterday. Seemed strange. If Mildred Hayes is at her apartment it is no accident. But it might cause one to you, eh Jeff darling? Are you going over there? - What do you think? Listen. If Carole Raymond phones tell her to come here to the office. Say anything to stop her going back to her apartment. That has to be easy. I'll just tell her that Walter Desmond came back to life. This is no time to be smart. Carole Raymond. Carole. What have I done? I thought it was you. What have I done? Why so subdued, Carole? Didn't thing go the way you wanted them in Kirby's office? It was a big responsibility. After all, I got you into this. I think I know what I'm doing, ma'am. Perfectly. Bill. Why is life not arranged so that so that we can always be sure of things and .. Others. And especially of ourselves? Because then ma'am, all the fun out of second-guessing would be gone. I'm hoping my second guess on a lot of things will still be fun. Well, I'll put an old bromide. I say "live for today". I say live for tonight. So, what time are we going to meet? It's almost 5 o'clock now. Good heavens. I've got to get to a telephone. I'll stop at the next drug store. Plenty to read. Paper! I won't be long. Papers! Hey, boy! Yes, sir? Paper, mister? - Yep. Here you are. - Thank you. What do you read? Latest results. Paper! What do you read? Paper! Hey, son. Yes, sir? Here you are. A chance to make a double profit. You can sell it over again. What's wrong? Not find what you wanted? And how. The answer to the $6,500 question. Is that good? - It's not bad. Operator. I've been calling Crestview 5-1-7-3-6 But there's no answer. I know someone is there. Will you try it for me please? Thank you. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Please stop. I won't answer it. Stop. Stop ringing! [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Alright. Thank you. Paper! Hey, what do you read? Paper! What's the matter, Carole? Something gone wrong? Bill, do you mind dropping me over at my place? Right away. - Sure. Is it urgent? I don't know. Please hurry. If it's not going to interfere with our date tonight Carole, how about 7:30? I'll meet you in front of the apartment. Sign there please. Well honey-child, we sure collected a sucker today. That sheep herder drives up to my office tomorrow morning with 6,500 bucks. Cash. Won't that be just ducky if he drives up in a patrol wagon? Read this? Somebody is sure playing ball but I wonder who is on whose team? Say, this guy could be a plant. What wonderful perception. Don't drop your crystal ball. I've been suspicious of Tyler since he first came here. Has Caldwell seen this wire? No. It just arrived. Nola, this could be the blow-off. Can you get hold of Caldwell? Where is he? I have a rough idea. And I do mean rough. Oh, please. Please leave me alone. I don't know anything anymore. You are lying. Carole Raymond asked you .. If you'd tell the police of your experience with Walter Desmond. You admitted that. She did, but .. She must have told you why. I want to know why. If you don't tell me now, I'll .. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Hello? Oh, Nola? Just a minute. I have a nice little piece of news for you. "Our investigation proves positively .." "No prominent sheep rancher named William Tyler in Utah." "Stop." "Suggest extreme caution." "Ralph Lewis." What? Well. That is interesting. It begins to tie up a lot of loose ends. Now listen. Come back here! What happened? Is she dead? Somebody send for a doctor. - Who is she? Who is she? - She doesn't live here. I've never seen her before. Have any of you folks ever seen her in this building before? She must have tripped and fallen down the stairs. Sorry I couldn't get here quicker. It's your Hollywood traffic. Thanks, Bill. I'll see you at 7:30. On the dot. Mildred. Jeff Caldwell. Mildred! Well chief, the pay-off is about due. From what I told you and what I'll get tonight .. I can start writing the story tomorrow morning. "Inform the D.A. to plant the cops where I told you." "So long." She'll be alright. [ Door knocks ] Why, hello Carole. Bill, I'm glad I found you. I need help. Can't it wait, ma'am? I was just leaving to get you. No it can't. I've got to find Caldwell. 0h. So our date goes out the window while you have to see Caldwell. I'm trying to tell you it's a girl. She's in trouble. If she isn't, she will be when your friends spring their oil racket on her. Who is she, a lady sheep-rancher? Bill, I .. I don't blame you for talking like that. But honestly you are going to regret it. I came here tonight because I need your help. You see Bill, I .. I happen to love you. Now you've got to trust me. You've got to think of me as I really am. I am thinking of you as you really are. One of Jeff Caldwell's con artists. A very beautiful bait for .. Suckers with bankrolls. You believe that, don't you? - Why shouldn't I? You tried to hook me in on a phony oil deal with Kirby. Don't think I wasn't wise to it all the time. On your way sister, and good luck! Alright, Bill. I'm going. I just want you to know that .. Whatever I did to you. I did for just one reason. To get enough on Jeff Caldwell to put him behind bars. I'm sorry but I don't believe you. Well. That's that. A girl in trouble and .. I think Caldwell knows where she is. We've got to find him. Either at his apartment or .. Or even the beach-house. The beach-house? Well, it's no novelty for you to seek him there. You probably met him there lots of times. I've been there just once before in my life, Bill. The night Walter Desmond died. I want to see Mr Caldwell. I'm sorry Miss, but he isn't in. I've had several calls for him but he doesn't answer. Would you like to leave a message? - No thank you. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Hello? What? Well. Carole. I'd just about given you up. Who? Oh. Oh yes, the young lady. Jeff, tell me the truth. Where is she? "She is safe, my dear. The child was hysterical and distracted." Saying some rather damaging things about both of us. I thought it best to bring her out here. Why don't you hurry out, Carole? She's been calling for you. I'll be out as soon as I can. Hello, Chief? Bill. I'm phoning at the office because I've got it. An all tied-up exclusive. Get ready for a quick page one re-plate. And tell the Rewrite Desk I'll be phoning in the story in a little while. "Get the D.A. Have his men lock up Kirby and Nola Reed, Caldwell's secretary." "I'll take care of Caldwell." "And I want a couple of cameramen because .." Okay, Bill .. I'll have the D.A.'s office pick up Nola Reed and Kirby. And listen, Bill. Just one thing more. Does this all mean that Desmond was murdered? "Well if it wasn't a murder I'll pay my expense account out of my own pocket." So long. Where is she, Jeff? Where is Mildred? Take it easy, Carole. Don't rush things. Sit down. Relax. I'll pour a couple of drinks. We've never had one together you know. I don't want a drink. You lied to me, Jeff. Mildred isn't here, is she? No .. as a matter of fact I've no idea where she is now. Now I know you are lying. I found your hat in my apartment. So what? Listen, my dear. I've known for days now that you were double-crossing me. And that is bad medicine, Carole. But. If Mildred isn't here .. Why did you want me down here? So you could do me one small favor, darling. This check for $40,000 is made out to both of us. I want you to endorse it. - What check? Walter Desmond's. But. That check was .. Was on the table the night that Desmond died. If. If you've got it, that means you must have been here that night. That's right, Carole. You threw him over that balcony. How very clever of you. You can't get away with it, Jeff. There's lots of things you can't explain. I'll cross those bridges when I come to them. But the first thing is to close your mouth. You know too much. You .. You mean ..? No. That's a little too noisy, darling. It'll be the same way I killed Desmond. Drop that gun. He's your man. Alright. Let's go. We'll be along in a few minutes. Bill. I'm sorry Carole for the things I said to you. You see .. I'm a reporter. I round up news, not ewes. You know, I always thought that sheep-herder's act was a bit too good. Well, we are .. Both a couple of phonies, aren't we. No, Carole. There is one thing about me that wasn't phoney. Me too. It is going to be fun getting acquainted with the real "us". And not through a friendship club. .. rode ..
