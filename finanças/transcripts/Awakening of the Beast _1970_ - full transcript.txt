''You only know what you've got once it's gone'' Pain is the price of the need to work Caused by the action of drugs Mr. Mojica So far you only listened and took notes Do you agree with Dr. Sergio? My position is neutral. l don't even know why l'm here l'll explain soon, Mr. Mojica But first, yet another episode Ridiculous! You're mistaking sexual frustration for stimulation through drugs! lt took me years of research to reach my conclusions Evil spreads evil Now strip! Everything? Slowly Very slowly You're so hot, you're on fire! l'm burning for action! Please don't be too rough Don't worry l swear l'll be the gentlest guy in the world What's up? l'm an adulteress Forgive me, honey You don't deserve this l know Don't hate me for this l swear you're the only one l love l don't want to do this!

She carried the evil in herself and didn't know it And resorted to drugs The evil that ended her life! But what of your own crime against society? - What crime? - None of your concern, Coffin Joe! This is a bit too intellectual for you! Excuse me, but Coffin Joe stayed behind in the graveyard You're talking to Jose Mojica Marins The point is... You committed a crime against medical science You used human beings in your experiments! That's what you're saying l don't see any crime in my statement Cut the hypocrisy, doctor! You said you used four addicts in an experiment with LSD l don't deny that. lt's all explained here And this is where you come in, Mr. Mojica l don't see what our discussion has to do with this man l was writing the final chapters of my book l was looking for a motif to help me round off my theory Jose Mojica Marins - or ''Coffin Joe'' Writer, director, actor and producer of films and TV shows Glauber Rocha, known all over the world... ...as a leading figure of New Brazilian Cinema... ...considers Coffin Joe a genuine primitive, a pure filmmaker Anselmo Duarte, Cannes prize winner... ...considers Coffin Joe a filmmaker of real talent Though most film critics don't take him seriously Coffin Joe - filmmaker or fraud? Guilty or not guilty? The People's Court of Truth will now hear the evidence and decide What do you think of life? It's absolutely empty Why not kill yourself? Suicide is a crime To argue with him is a waste of time I have no intention of arguing I ask a simple question and expect a straight answer If you think life is rotten you must explain why To explain such a thing is beyond my power How do your movies contribute to Brazilian Cinema? I create jobs and give audiences what they want His writing is just trashl Only good for the garbage can Then it's good for something Mojica, that long fingernail of yours... That wild boar's claw... - Do you hang your coat on it? - My reply has been censored What's the title of your next film? Ritual of the Sadists I know it's hard to make films in Brazil But couldn't you at least make one happy one? Making films here is like trying to send a rocket to the moon We have no resources to make movies The filmmaker has to do everything for himself He has to buy imported film stock Film stockl He has to reinvent the wheel To give audiences what they want to see Otherwise the cinemas will close Reviewers will sell bananas and filmmakers will eat the peell We saw a man alone I believe this man has the right to a defender And now, I summon his attorney I knew anything could happen in this trial But I never imagined that one of us would be so rude as to insult our guest Refuse to greet him Call him a moron, a cretin, and throw onto the floor a comic book he publishes, which sells 7 0,000 copies To correct the grammar of our self-described uneducated guest I now call a witness of impeccable credentials who will defend the accused A man who understands film better than any of us This man commands respect He believes in something And he acts on what he believes in The praise of intellectuals doesn't matter There are many overrated frauds out therel Members of the jury, please state your decision I acquit Jose Mojica Marins - Very well. Next? - Not guilty - Next? - Set him free Very well. Next? I acquit Ze Do Caixao I want to remind you that we are all individuals Acquit Ze do Caixao Next? Guiltyl Very well. Six votes to one Ze do Caixao is acquitted That concludes the first part Our guest now has one minute to answer I thank all the jurors What matters is how we think of ourselves Whatever you do, however insignificant Try to make your work of benefit to mankind That's all you can do Thank you and good night Your book's sure to be a best-seller, doctor With your credentials lt should be a document of great social importance - Don't you agree? - l don't know l can only promise it'll be sincere and honest Based only on proven facts lf l could be of any help, doctor l'd be proud to take part in your project l could certainly use some help l'm looking for four drug addicts Each from a different social class That should be easy l'll ask Mourao, our crime reporter l'm planning an experiment using LSD Test the reaction of each of the four in a given situation Did you find that motif? l'm still looking But l think l'm close ''We have the complete Coffin Joe series'' - A Ze do Caixao poster, please - Just a minute ACCOUNTANT Hello? Speaking. What? All right. OK Six-thirty. OK? Bye - All right? - l'm fine - What's this? - A present So what's up now? Don't tell me the price's going up again! Nothing like that l'm looking for 4 people to take part in an experiment lt's a doctor He's looking for some people to try out LSD lnterested? That stuff costs a packet The doc's paying for everything He's writing a book and wants to study your reactions OK, Waldomiro. l have to be off now - We'll fix the details later, OK? - Fine l have great news for you There's a doctor wants volunteers for an LSD experiment You were suggested Me? That's fascinating, Anita l have to let my dealer know A reporter asked him to find some volunteers Great. lt'll be a new buzz for me l'm dead tired l'm tired too. See you guys tomorrow - Sorry, l was talking to a client - lt sounded urgent Good news this time A reporter l know asked me to find four people For an experiment a doctor wants to do with LSD l hope you'll do it l know what you're thinking, but it's quite safe What's it all for? For a book he's writing about addicts A reporter l know told me about it Don't worry, there'll be no trouble lt's all being kept very quiet An offer l can't refuse. Just tell me when Cool, honey. Wait for my call. Bye But you know l work for TV So what? - Sure l won't get arrested? - Come on, man! You know l only make safe deals You in, or not? ln l'll study your reactions in certain situations This will help me in my research The whole thing depends on you Now, let's begin our experiment Why do you touch me? You are a man l'll sleep with you if you want. Why can't l say that? Sometimes l don't grab everything within reach You know how to judge me. l'll be on my knees lt's easy l'll let my body down, and drop my head and shoulders Look! l'm not wearing the clothes you gave me l think to be ashamed is to be brave Yes, l'm brave. l'm in love with you A woman who gives what she doesn't have... ...doesn't give much My body is untouched lt's easy to go through the Black Hole Your virginity is no barrier l feel ashamed next to you This is the Black Hole. Forty years will pass l don't say no The bottom of the pit cracks and the sewage rises up But the desires it brings are weak Do you want to buy her? She is my property Help! l'm being sold! This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse Which of the shows The movie l hate Ze do Caixao. l couldn't stand his TV shows Those fingernails are disgusting! But l had to admit, he had the strongest effect on me For me, he's just a great artist l think he's a genius. l worked with him on TV He made a strong impression on me Then it's decided The focus of our experiment will be Ze do Caixao Power! lt's a dimension beyond the mind of man Where woman is justly assigned to her proper place From the beginning to the end of the centuries Man is the ruler of all! He is the ruler of life And woman is his instrument His acts know no reproach! She is the willing slave before the power of man! So has it been throughout the ages So shall it be... until the end of everything! He is right. Man's acts can't be condemned Man rules and woman submits lt's the world humankind has always been seeking Our reward for the suffering for the lack of understanding Woman is, and shall always be across the barriers of time and the dimensions of the universe the unattainable goal of the foul tarnish that emanates from man's bestial desires! He is the Prince of Darkness The protector of the wretched Good and evil merge as one A neutral entity adjusts itself to ordinary reason That unreachable layer Unknown Unexplored And fantastic! Forms the fabric of reality ln relentless pursuit of perpetuity Whoever dedicates himself to that quest Will find the doors of the abyss open to him Neither good nor evil can halt the mortal branded with my mark! His world is a work of art lt is poetry of the macabre He is hell incarnate Disciple of the King of Darkness Pain itself made matter! Flesh becomes blood! And blood becomes water! To bathe throughout eternity and glorify the pleasures of pain in the body of the damned! So it shall be, from one galaxy to another From one existence to another! The little, forever midgets The great, eternal giants! He's a sadist, a degenerate. The Devil incarnate! That's all gentlemen. You all know the results And now the book is published You used people like guinea pigs! Even if they were all addicts! And you made their addictions worse Sorry to disappoint you But l didn't use LSD or any drugs in my experiment l simply used distilled water And l have proof of that What sort of proof? My subjects underwent a rigorous blood test Before and after the experiment Men and women. lt was all done very precisely Here's the report With the results lt does say distilled water But what was the point of your experiment? The aim of your book? Yes, what were you trying to prove? Narcotics only serve to release what is inside all of us lf someone commits a crime while on drugs... ...his mind was already sick, and his instinct exacerbated ln brief, such a person is a menace to society My message is not to destroy drugs But to moderate their use lncrease our vigilance on those who deal in them lt was this power of auto suggestion that l set out to demonstrate So all those nightmares were caused by suggestion? Precisely. They thought they were on drugs Their minds did the rest Why did you pick Ze do Caixao? l used the character of Ze do Caixao because he is controversial and generates heated arguments The way he visualises horror touches the subconscious of his fans and detractors alike So he is a powerful figure for many people Exactly what l was looking for Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention As we conclude another program in the series A Light in the Darkness Okay That's it! Get that camera out of the way! l'd really like to know Where do you get your stories? That's easy Where your work ends, mine begins. OK? Want a ride? No, thanks, l'd rather walk. Bye Cut! THE END
