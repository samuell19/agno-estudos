I like the wind. And the rain too. But... What I like most is you. Everyone has a dream. My dream is not to be James Bond. My dream is not to be a professional dancer. My dream is not to be a flight attendant, traveling around the world. My dream is not to be a rock star. My dream is not to be Captain Marvel, saving the world. My dream is quite simple. It's to be a chef and cook for the person I love. You are cheating the netizens again. You can't even fry an egg, not to mention cooking for the person you love. Your things are in a mess. Cut! Take off your clothes. They need to be returned to the sponsors before three. It's hot. My name is Wu Zhen Zhen. I'm a princess on social media. In reality, I'm a worker. This is my single dad. His name is Wu Liang Guang. That's why he always lives in the dark. Others are the rich second generation. But he is the poor third generation. The fourth generation will probably be poor too. The person on the right is my uncle, Jin Shui. On the left is my best friend, Zito. They are both my agents, servants, make-up artists, stylists, photographers, and hairdressers. They do all sorts of work. And eventually, they become zombies. However, I think they are just like magicians. Because they can turn a crazy girl like me into a goddess. Sorry. That's someone else's photography team. This is my team. That girl whose makeup looks like a Chinese opera singer is Amy. She's my senior. Currently, she is the most popular online celebrity. Someday, I will replace her. Darn. It's too dark. I can't see anything. Can you be more professional? When can we be professionals like them? Raise your hand a bit. Hand... Like this? Your leg too. Shove the bag behind. Just show it a little. People will notice it's a fake if the shots are clear. Not seductive enough. More. Seductive? No! Too seductive. You need to be seductive yet innocent. That's called a split personality. Zhen Zhen? Amy. You're done with work? Amy, can I have a photo with you? Sure. Okay, I will take my leave. You can continue with your work. Bye. Laugh all you want. Someday, I will become a princess just like Cinderella. Faster. Can you please be faster? Faster. A little faster. Faster... Slow down a little! Look. The beauty and the car post have more than a thousand likes in less than ten minutes. It's worthwhile that you hurt your head. I dedicate my life to photo shooting. I'm exhausted too. I have to edit all the photos and add filters. Are you referring to your own photos? We should strike while the iron is hot. Tomorrow, we'll go to Bangkok for a photo shoot. Do we have to? I'm exhausted. Yes, let's rest for one day. Rest? Look around you. In this age with the rising use of social media, you could easily run into a few online celebrities on the street. You could also easily crash into several YouTubers. Everyone is working hard. If you don't work hard, you will be washed out. What theme are we shooting tomorrow? The theme is the young and budding Xiaolongnu. Xiaolongnu? More like Xiaolongbao. It's Angkor Wat. It's beautiful. This is the most distinctive Cambodian travel package of our JCY Travel Agency. I promise it will satisfy your needs. If you travel to Cambodia next time, remember to call me. Okay. Want to enjoy Angkor Wat? Choose JCY. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. So where are we staying tonight? I have booked a unique homestay online. Look. This is a homestay? It's more like a refugee camp. Is there anything to eat nearby? There's a caf√© on the left. What would you like to order? Let's have some drinks. What would you like to drink? How many jobs does he have? He is so versatile. - Cheers. - Cheers. The song I want to sing today is "I Thought". Often, we think that our partners are like that. And our partners think that we are like this. A lot of relationships end quickly just like that. Enough said. I present to you, "I Thought". I thought, you thought I thought, you thought I thought, you thought I thought I thought, you thought I thought, you thought I thought, you thought I thought I thought, you thought I thought, you thought I thought I thought, you thought I thought, you thought I thought What are you doing? What's the matter? Listen. I'd rather die than give in. Even if you have my body, you can't have my heart. Just take it! Let's start our meeting. You think too much. Get up. I have checked online. The sunlight on the mountain is the most beautiful between 7 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. We will leave at 5 a.m., get ready at the peak at 6 a.m., and start working at 7 a.m. Leave at 5 a.m.? That means... That means you need to put on makeup at 3 a.m. - What time is it now? - It's 2:30 a.m. I've checked the weather forecast online. Tomorrow, the mountains will be sunny. Clear blue skies! Sunny? Clear blue skies? The weather is unpredictable. But it's okay. It will be ethereal when the wind is strong. This is Xiaolongnu? It's more like Sadako. Enough. Let's go to the Thai temple down the hill for shelter. - We'll wait until the weather is fine. - Okay. Let's go. Lower your head a little. Move a little to the left. Move a little to the right. To the right. Okay, perfect. Crazy. Xiaolongnu. You're a fairy. You need to look elegant. What if someone sees you? There's no one here. Isn't that someone? There's a handsome man. There's a camera in his hands as well. But why can their aura be so different? I wish I could meet him again. I wish I could have 100 pursuers. 100 pursuers? You should be grateful even if you have one pursuer. A little more smoke. I need a sense of happiness. Okay? What is a sense of happiness? The sense of happiness is not enough. Give me more. I can't believe my wish came true so quickly. Guo'er. I'm here. That's too much. What I want to imply is happiness, not sexuality. The sense of happiness is gone. Yang Guo became a condor. There's no sense of happiness at all. "Preventing forest fires is everyone's responsibility." - What? - What? "Preventing forest fires is everyone's responsibility." Sorry. It's just a small fire. Small? One small spark can turn into a flame. Can I take a selfie with you? Thank you. You're just like an angel. Okay? Everybody, don't move. Trust me. The visual range of bees is only 50 cm. If they see us run, they will attack us. People go separate ways in the event of a disaster. Some choose to dance. Some choose to jump into the river and commit suicide. Some choose to transform into a tree. Some choose to play Jesus. But I was chosen. It's him. Frankly, at that moment, I really appreciate the bees as our matchmaker. At that moment, I felt like the bees had turned into butterflies, and we're like the Condor Heroes. I thought, you thought I thought, you thought I thought I thought, you thought Pain? A little. You can speak Mandarin? Just a little. Then I will be gentle. Sorry. Hello? Okay. I'm coming. All right. I have to go now. Goodbye. Goodbye. Who is that handsome Thai man? He is my savior. My goodness. Is that his sports car? Romance dramas are not true. How are there so many rich and handsome guys? Romance dramas are real. He really is handsome and rich. More handsome than me? You finally noticed me. It's okay. I forgot to ask for his number. Why do you get back from shooting with your injuries getting more serious? Did you go to war or a photo shoot? I dedicate my life to photo shooting. This one is more serious. Turned into a vegetable upon returning home. Are you cold? No, not that. She's got the heat. No, she doesn't. She is not having a fever. She got the hots for someone. You're a virus All-pervasive Lurking in my heart My heart beats fast I'm in a trance God said that I'm hopeless You're a virus All-pervasive Eating into my heart My mind loses consciousness I'm in a coma God said that I'm hopeless -Missing someone is a torture -Missing someone is a torture -A sweet torture -A sweet torture -Two stray cats in heat -Two stray cats in heat -Not sleeping in the dead of night -Not sleeping in the dead of night -Time seems to have stopped -Time seems to have stopped -I don't need anything -I don't need anything -Except missing you -Except missing you -You are my only -You are my -Remedy -Remedy Go to your room to rest. I'll cook dinner. Coquette, your remedy. What remedy? That handsome Thai guy's Instagram profile. You have his account? How did you find it? A Thai netizen helped me find it. I have checked out his account. Congratulations. He is still single. Look. He's still single despite his good qualifications. There's only one possibility. He's gay. My heartfelt sympathy goes to you. You're just jealous, poor ugly shorty. He replied to me. Hurt? My face hurts like hell. - You don't even bat an eyelid. - Just accept your fate, shorty. He's in Kuala Lumpur. He asked me to meet him. Meet him? Don't say yes too soon. Listen. I know these bad men. You need to pique his interest. You need to slow down. I'm putting on my makeup now. What kind of girl do you like? I like girls who are caring. Be careful. You're sweating. I like girls who can dance. I also like girls who can cook. Girls I like most are those who can play the piano well. How about you? What kind of guy do you like? I like... guys... like you. My goodness. Don't tease me. Do you have to show off your relationship like this? I'm going to be blinded. I've come up with the next theme. Infatuated love. Look. Your infatuated love with Nat has succeeded in making thousands of female netizens jealous. And break the hearts of countless male netizens. You're now a veritable online celebrity. See? When you become popular, a boss wants you for an endorsement right away. Hi, we have an appointment with Mr. Lai. I feel uneasy about this. I will walk with you until here then. Coward. I think I forgot to put in a parking ticket. - Really? - Let's go. Let's go and put in the parking ticket. My boss hates people who are late. Last week, two people were late so... So what? So, one is in a wheelchair for life and the other is still in the hospital. Boss, Zhen Zhen is here. Have a drink. Everyone has a price. Just state your price. So what price do you think Zhen Zhen is worth? 300,000 ringgit. Here's the contract. 300,000 ringgit just for an endorsement? Besides that, you need to accompany me overseas to promote. Food, accommodation, and travel are all included. If you sign that contract, it will really include everything. I'm sorry. I'm not an escort. I'm an online celebrity. Online celebrity? You think you are so popular? Work for me and you will be popular. Lewd. Just find someone else. Let's go. Take me, I'm okay with 300,000 ringgit. - We can talk about the price. - Let's go. Can you man up? You probably don't know this. My friends call me the Malaysian Donnie Yen. If you don't open the door... It's too dangerous for you to be a photographer. Just find another job. Zhen Zhen. The bag you purchased online has arrived. My Infinence bag. It's gorgeous. You're getting a lot of offers for endorsements recently. Nat really is your lucky star. Tonight, we will go out to celebrate our one-week anniversary. So you had better hold him tight this time. How? I can't breathe. If Nat sees you, he won't be able to breathe either. Who is Nat? Are you kidding? We've been talking and you still don't know who he is? Nat is a rich Thai man Zhen Zhen met recently. Rich man? Then it needs to be tighter. Let him have a nosebleed. I've reached my limit. She's so lucky to have a boyfriend. Tomorrow is my birthday. Happy birthday in advance. We should go out and have fun tonight. No. You said you wanted to drink. Why are we here? You haven't bought me a birthday present. I'll buy you a cake. I don't want a cake. I want this. Let's go to a few more shops to make comparisons. Don't worry. I already have. There is one more year of warranty if we buy it here. And they will send it directly to your home for free. Excuse me. That night I shot myself I looked at my wound With a polite smile I apologize for dirtying you And another shot Until my makeup was ruined Until my thirst was gone And sprinkled them slowly, gently, gloriously I think I'm broken Thank you For your silent support Thank you for your sparse applause. It's not easy to be a singer these days. It's better to be an online celebrity. Cheers. I'm happy even if I don't have a boyfriend. At worst, I'll stay with you in the old folks' home. Isn't that Amy? Amy. Amy, are you crazy? You are with someone who is shorter and uglier than me. I'm heartbroken. Get out! What? Do you think this club is yours? That's right. This club is mine. What? This is nothing. Since young, all the girls I ever wanted, I never had them. Says who? You can always have me. Have you thought long enough? I've been pouting for ten minutes. Is it so hard for you to kiss me? Nobody wants me even when I offer myself to them. Am I not attractive? Have breakfast. No appetite. Do you think I'm any different today? No. You were very bad last night. We're all adults. We're just having fun. Don't be too serious. What kind of fun? Having fun? Look. My lips are in pain because of your kiss. I don't care. You had my first kiss. One kiss and I'm married to you. We will have a small family. Two boys and two girls. I'm happy just thinking about it. Hello. Hello. I'm Zhen Zhen's dad. Hello, sir. Hello. Sir, when are you free? I would like to treat you to dinner. He isn't free. He is very busy. I'm free. Okay. Okay, then see you next Sunday. Okay, bye. "Kam lam tai luk. Kam lun ki long guai. Tiao na ma. Tomyam kung. Po kai." Did you accidentally curse in Thai? Basic Thai. It's for Zhen Zhen's sake. It's for your own sake. You're unbelievable. What? I'm just preparing myself to meet my future son-in-law. Why are you so mad? The problem is he thinks we're rich. Enough. I'm going to confess everything to Nat. Don't. If Nat breaks up with you, your popularity will plunge. You'll lose your endorsements and have to pay compensation. For your happiness, just keep it from him. Happiness? You mean money, right? Happiness comes with money. We will just pretend to be rich. Rich? Look at yourself. You don't look like a rich man at all. Clothes make the man. Makeup makes the woman. To look rich, you just need to dress up. Firstly, I need a limited-edition Rolex watch worth 30,000 ringgit. An identical watch at a roadside stall will only cost... Thirty ringgit. The hands look fashionable, and now the feet. A pair of crocodile leather shoes at a roadside stall costs only... 29.90 ringgit. And then I'll transform my old white hair into shiny black hair. More stylish than Chow Yun Fat. Then I'll wear the wedding suit that I've worn only once in my life. Lastly, I'll make my appearance in a Mercedes. Don't you need to pay for the ride? It's 32.50 ringgit. Dad, have you arrived yet? I'm at the entrance of the restaurant. My family has been poor for three generations. Today, I can finally walk with pride. Rookie, take these to the kitchen. I... Where's the kitchen? Don't put things here. Take them away. Look carefully. I'm not a waiter. I don't care who you are. Take them away. You started this. Don't blame me. Today, I will use my fist to tell you what is... Dad! What happened? Zhen Zhen? My dad... Why don't you turn on the lights? What happened to you? It's hard to say. It's so humiliating. How could you say I'm humiliating? I don't want to talk to you anymore. You... You're a popular online celebrity now. You're ashamed of me. Fine. I'm running away from home. I'll run away, so you don't have to worry about me anymore. I won't humiliate you anymore. I'm leaving. Don't stop me. No one's stopping you. Hey. Where are you staying tonight? Tonight, I'll sleep at Shangri-La. The park opposite it. Who do you think I am? A beggar? Sir? Sir. Nat. What a coincidence. - You're here too. - Yes. Do you like to exercise too? Yes. I like the morning sun and fresh air. It was a dream. I'm still dreaming. Here. have some tea. Thank you. What's going on? Nat? Hey. Zhen Zhen. Nat has seen your true colors. You don't have to pretend anymore. Come out, Zhen Zhen. Those pictures on the internet are all made up. My dad is not a rich second generation. - He's the poor third generation. - I know. I can't dance. I only know how to jump from a building. I know. I can't cook, I only know how to eat. I know. How do you know? Look. I looked so graceless. This isn't graceless. It's cute. I thought you were cute that day, so I secretly took some photos. Why didn't you say so earlier? I wouldn't have to pretend so hard. So the more graceless I am, the more you like it? I like everything about you. My mom asked me to return to Thailand. When? The day after tomorrow. What am I going to do? I'm starting to miss you right now. Zhen Zhen. Are you religious? Yes. What do you believe in? Your eyes. Okay. Are you Zhen Zhen? My mom. Ma'am. Hello. My mom is Thai-Chinese, so she can speak Mandarin. So it's because of you Nat doesn't like to stay at home and keeps thinking of going to Malaysia. So I have decided. Nat's sister and I will go to your bungalow for the reunion dinner on Chinese New Year's eve. We'll stay for one night to experience the festive atmosphere in Malaysia. Why? Are we not welcome? Of course you're welcome. We're screwed. My mom thinks you are rich and live in a big house. Just be honest with her. She will definitely oppose us being together. It's just a reunion dinner. Do you have to be so worried? His mom said they are staying at our bungalow for one night. Let them stay in my room then. Even their bathroom is bigger than your room. His mom will surely be disgusted with me. Ladies and gentlemen. Her future mother-in-law wants to have a reunion dinner with us. We must find a solution to that. Whoever destroys Zhen Zhen's happiness destroys my happiness as well. Do you have any plans? First, we will look for a bungalow to pretend to be our home. Then we'll find some people to play a few roles. Then we'll ask a chef to cook a big reunion dinner. Then the countdown starts. Three, two, one. There will be fireworks. Then under the fireworks, the prince will propose to our princess. Then, of course, our princess will nod shyly and say, "Yes." Then it will just be like the "happily ever after" in the fairy tales. And then, I'll be rich. Then I want to ask. Do you have the money for the plan? Don't worry. I have my ways. With your dad's intelligence, I will figure it out immediately. It's okay, Dad. You've been thinking about it the whole night. There's no need for that now. We've come up with a solution. First, the reunion dinner is settled. My aunt is a chef. She promised to cook for us. Great. The bungalow is settled. - My ex is... - Ex? What ex? Why didn't you mention her before? Just put this matter aside first. Focus on the overall situation. My ex is a property agent. She said she can lend us a bungalow. Great. The cast is settled too. My senior manages a drama class. He can get us some cast for free. Great. Look. Isn't this bungalow grand? The owner happens to be selling the house and is traveling overseas. That's why I can lend it to you secretly for three days. Thank you so much. We've known each other for a long time. There's no need to thank me. I don't know what to say except thank you. Just don't say anything then. How are you doing after we broke up? How am I doing? I don't know what to say. Just don't say anything then. Talk about the time when you were dating. Did you have bad eyesight? I was blind. But my eyes recovered after we broke up. No wonder. What do you mean by that? Who is he? He's the owner of this house. Remember, things in this house are expensive. Don't break anything. Here's the house key. Remember. He will be back on the third day of the Chinese New Year. I'll take my leave. We'll keep in touch. Don't worry. When we get married, I'll contact you. Hi, everyone. I'm Gaston. I'm Zhen Zhen's senior. President of the 2008 Chao Yang High School Drama Society. I specialize in performing arts and program planning. I've prepared five characters for you. First, the maid. Gaston. What we need is a maid, not a beauty. Does she not look like a maid? More like uniform temptation. Yes, tempting husbands to cheat and break up families. So, what should a maid look like? Well, someone who looks ordinary and from the lower class at first glance. A bit fat, much like an older woman. It's Chinese New Year, not Halloween. This look is more like a maid. Do I look like an old woman? Ma'am. I came to audition for the security role. He's the security? Are you trying to attract robbers? Please give me a chance. I'm just trying to get some acting experience to pave the way for my future acting career. Go for it. You're still young. You still have a long way to go. That's right. I plan to venture into acting next year. Venture into acting? You're close to venturing into death. We have the maid and the security. Next, let's welcome the choreman. Hello. I'm here for the choreman character. Choreman? Are you trying to seduce wives into being unfaithful to their husbands? A choreman isn't supposed to be like that. A choreman should be someone who looks stupid, illiterate, and silly. Next, the chauffeur. This one is the most normal. The last character is crucial. I will take on the butler character. Now, it'll be foolproof. Everybody, it's showtime. Where's the chef, your relative? She's getting ready in the kitchen. Great. I need to thank her personally. Regarding that day's incident, please accept my sincere apology. I hope you can put aside our dispute and focus on the overall situation. Are there any specialties for the reunion dinner? What's your signature dish? I don't have any. No signature dish? Because I know how to cook in every way. All of them are my signature dishes. Lucky us. Your future family-in-law is Thai. Why don't we prepare a few Michelin-star Thai dishes? Great. Coconut milk crab soup. Spicy lobster. Lemongrass leopard coral grouper. Thai... We don't have much budget. Then what's your budget? 2,000 ringgit? 200 ringgit. 200 ringgit? That's easy. I'll just cook one dish of Hokkien Mee. Please help us. I need two assistants. A second cook and a third cook. Here, a second and third cook. Do you know how to cook? - No, but we can learn. - Learn? You think you're cooking instant noodles? We're cooking a reunion dinner. Don't look down on us. I've worked in the kitchen before becoming an actor. I would like to see your skills. HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR Mom, this is Zhen Zhen. Hello, ma'am. Her face is dark and so are her clothes. It's as if she's attending a funeral. Please come in. My goodness. That Thai dinosaur is Nat's sister? Their genetics are so different. I think it's a genetic mutation. In-law. She's not my mom. She's my sister, Angela. Zilla. It's "Angela." Angela. Hello, my in-law. Hello. Some say people age as time goes by. That's not true at all. You don't seem to age. You should speak Mandarin. Great, you can speak Mandarin. My mom is Thai-Chinese. She can speak Mandarin. This is a Chinese New Year gift from us. Hai-O healthcare hamper. All right, thank you. Where's my room? This way, please. Who's that? My grandpa. That's awesome. Come on. I'm afraid of water. It's okay, I'm here. My goodness. What happened to you? There was a Thai shark. Aren't you preparing the reunion dinner? You're still going out? To buy groceries. Mr. Wu. Zilla. No. I mean, Angela. Yes? Excuse me. The water heater has no water. Can you help me to examine it? No water? Yes. Can you help me fix it? There's the water supply. I'm all wet. Here, wear this. No need. It's okay. You can put up with that Thai dinosaur. Are you that hungry? - What? - What about my late sister? It's not what you think. She is Nat's sister. If you're with her, she would be Zhen Zhen's mom. Angela's mom becomes your mom. Your mom would be Zhen Zhen's mom. Angela would be Nat's mom. Gosh, it's so confusing. Hey, she needed water supply. I was just helping her. I can't control the water splashing on me. You're so bad. Hello, you called for some gas? Just a second. Let me check. Don't move! I'll kill her if you move! Actually, who's the one that wants to kill? How could you betray us? You're colluding with an outsider. Because this woman is dripping with gold and silver. Dude, give me some face. The people all knew me in the past. If you leave now, I can pretend nothing happened and let you off. You're coveting her beauty? That's right. It's a waste if I don't do it. Take her to the room. No! She's not the one I want! I want the one behind her. You want me? Are you sure? No! Don't mess around! It's okay, Mom. I've been waiting for this. No, what I meant is, I can't let you suffer. No! I'm still young. - Mom, let it be me. - Me. - Me. - I still can. - Me! - Enough! Can you consider how I feel? Take off your ring. No way. This is a token of love my late husband left for me. I won't take it off! - Take it off! - No! Mom! Take it off, it's just a ring. No! Then I'll have to cut off your finger. Okay, fine. Shoot me if you dare. Give it to me! - Ma'am! - No! Give it to me! Ma'am! Help... Help! Mom! Mom! You can't swim, but you still want to save people. Boss, here you go. Get out! It depends on whose knife is faster. Give me your hand. Let's go. Get up and start working. Where's the second cook? I'm coming. Pass the fish to me. Is there anything I can help with? Standing there is the biggest help you can give. Is everything okay? What happened to your hands? Can you still cook? I'm fine. I got everything under control. Okay, how long will it take to have the dishes served? About 30 minutes. Okay, keep it up. How much longer? Thirty minutes more. Everyone, the dinner will be served shortly. Let's have a drink at the dining hall to whet our appetite. Red chili. Red chili. It needs to be chopped finely. Hurry up. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Red chili. - It hurts! - Excuse me. - What did you do? - I'll go and have a look. What happened? Just say it, don't cry. Don't worry. I got everything under control. Who are you calling at this late hour? Food delivery! Hello, food delivery? Come, let's have another one. I can't. I have had two bottles. I am drunk. Enough. Excuse me. So? Ask them to hurry. It's useless. The food delivery hasn't arrived. What now? Just keep waiting? Right. Why don't we do a Thai dance performance? Where do we find dancers at this late hour? You noticed it even though I kept a low profile about it. Actually, besides acting, dancing is my other strength. I used to be the main dancer in the dance class. The hottest female dancer! No, male dancer. Everyone, before we start our reunion dinner, why don't we enjoy a Thai dance performance? Music. The hands will break if the music doesn't stop. So? We drank and danced. The food delivery hasn't arrived yet? Not yet. Call him again. I've called many times. Call him again. Hello? Where are you now? Almost there. You said that an hour ago. Now you said it an hour later. Where are you actually? Almost there. That's him. Hurry up and serve the food. I'll go in first. I'm so sorry, Happy Chinese New Year. You're so late. Still wishing us "Happy Chinese New Year"? You said you'll "arrive instantly after ordering". Why don't you arrive at one in the morning? I'm so sorry. There were too many orders. What we ordered was a reunion dinner, not supper. I need to apologize first. As we lacked ingredients, we changed the dishes. Good things come to those who wait. Let's welcome our chef tonight. Enjoy a reunion meal on Chinese New Year. Return to a hometown that is full of love. Do you know? The Chinese are very particular about the auspicious symbols behind the reunion dinner dishes. Every dish has its own meaning. Do you know? I don't know anything. All I know is that I'm very hungry that I could eat a horse. Serve the dishes. The first dish. Winter melon tofu. After eating this dish, we would encounter accidents, right? No. Listen carefully. Winter melon tofu. "Winter is here, so spring is not that far." Right. Fried salted fish with bean sprouts. That means "things get better." Steamed red grouper. "Abundance year after year." Stir-fried green beans. "Peace throughout the four seasons," right? Fried pork with ginger and onion. It means "to earn a lot of money." The last dish, headless chicken in a paper bag. I know that. It means "not in peace"! Nonsense. Let's eat. Let's eat. Ten seconds until Chinese New Year. Come on. Let's count down together. - Ten, nine... - Ten, nine... - Eight... - What? - Seven, six... - Emergency, the house owner called me! - Five... - What? - Four, three, two... - He told me he's on his way home. - One! - One! Who are you guys? What are you doing here? Leave now or I'll call the police! The beauty can stay. Leave now! Or I'll call the police! In-law. Yes. We were acting. But... Acting? That sounds good. Actually, all of you are liars. My grandpa. In-law. Shut up. I hate being lied to. Actually, it's all me. I asked them to lie to you. I'm the liar. It's not Zhen Zhen's fault. No. I wanted Zhen Zhen to lie to you. - I'm the liar. - No. It's me. I'm the liar. It's not you, it's me. - I'm the liar. - It's me. - It's not your fault. - Enough! Ma'am. I'm so sorry. This is my fault. I'm a liar. I don't deserve to be with your son. Great, you have self-awareness. Smiling means everything is all right, isn't it? Let's go to my house and dance. You guys go. - I'm going to jump from a building. - What? Stop right there. - Mom. - Not you. I'm referring to Zhen Zhen. I haven't finished scolding yet. Are you crazy? You can't swim.
