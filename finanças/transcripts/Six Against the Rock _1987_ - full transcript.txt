[FOREBODING MUSIC] [METAL CLAMOR] Hey, how was the vacation? Great, took in Yosemite. I think this hill got steeper while I was gone. Well, have you thought about living on the island? No, Kathy won't consider it. It's too close to the cons, she says. And she doesn't have to take the boat over from Frisco ever day. Did you tell her about all the great restaurants we got here? Yeah, and those great little shops? Yeah, but you know women once they make up their minds. [BUZZER] [LOCK OPENING] Welcome home. Yeah, I can hardly wait to get back. [CHUCKLING] Good morning. Morning. All yours, Burch. -Thanks for nothing. -See you later. OK. Armory-- uh, this is Burch in the west gun gallery, on watch. Right. DUTCH: I awaken to grey, and grey is my morning sun. I live grey, and all of my days are like one. There is no color, only shadows along my way. Sometimes I think the blood in my body must also be prison grey. Hey kid, I see they still got you in lock-up, huh? Oh, I ain't got nothing for you. Nah, I'm lying. There was a letter. I read it, see? And it'd just make you feel bad. It's from your old man. It says your sister's been sleeping all around, and your mama's got VD. At least that's what they'd write if they knew how. Meanwhile, just behave yourself, or I'll see you in solitary. OFFICER: Breakfast-- move it out! You with us? I got 'til noon. Servin' up grits today. That ought to please you, Marv. No sir, we ain't much for grits in Tennessee. That's farther down south. My little girl, though, she took a liking to them, with honey on them. That little girl of yours may not be so little any more. Yeah, Atola sent me a picture two weeks you. Hard times, Mr. Bristow-- just trying to feed them. You got the time? Time? What do you care? You're not going anywhere. Right. You sure are right there, Mr. Bristow. All accounted here except the lock-ups. Burch, send down 107. BURCH: Right. All right, let's go! Let's go! Mr. Corwin? CORWIN: Morning, Bernie. Morning, Mr. Corwin. [INAUDIBLE]. Breaking even. The way I figure, it's better than breaking out. Thought you might have changed your mind. That ain't going to work, Bernie. It'll work. It's got to. "Got to" won't get you out of here. BERNIE: It's all planned out. Yeah, sure it is. Now if you can only walk on water. We're taking over the boat. I wish you luck. Wait for the signal. Mr. Lageson-- how are your bunions, Mr. Miller? A lot better, thanks. That moleskin stuff you told me about really works. Much obliged to you. You still losing weight? Oh, I'm afraid so, Mr. Miller. My gums hurt so bad, most the time I just can't eat anything. You need to take something for the pain. Oh, doc won't allow no pain killers, Mr. Miller-- strict regulations. Maybe I can speak to the warden about your condition. He's a reasonable man. BERNIE: I don't think so, Mr. Miller. It wouldn't look good to the other cons. But I should do thank you for the offer. Mr. Lageson. It's moving up towards noon, kid. Bernie, I think I'm going to pass on this. I'm only 19. I can get out someday. Don't kid yourself. You going to end up just like the Birdman. We need you, id. We need you. I just don't want anymore blood-- no more killing. Bernie, that guy I shot-- I swear to God it was an accident. But he's dead just the same. Look, you got my promise. We go out clean. And a guy built like you can keep the screws in line without a gun. But the trouble is you got Cretz and Crazy Sam. BERNIE: Dutch knows the ropes. He's made a couple of breaks before. And he ain't leaving without Sam. And what about Thompson. I never know what he's thinking or what he's going to do. BERNIE: Who does? But he wants out bad, just like us. He ain't going to give us any trouble. Think about it, kid. Just keep thinking about getting out of here. Is the car all set? It's waiting for us right now in Frisco. There are clothes there. There's a hideout. It's the way I operate-- connections. That's the trouble with you, Hubbard-- depression bums, you never made connections. How much time have we got? The prison boat docks here at 2:00. We got 40 minutes to make it. Well we better make it. You know what I'm saying to you Bernie? We just better make it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BOAT WHISTLE] OFFICER: Coming in! Burch, send down key 107. BURCH: Right. [PULLEY SQUEAKING] After they wash up, get the count, send them on in to lunch. Mr. Simpson, I don't feel much like eating today. I got a sick slip from the doc, said I might have an ulcer. Ulcer? That comes from worrying. You haven't got anything to worry about for the next 99 years. Ain't that right, Thompson? Yes, sir. Lock him in his cell, and apprise Corwin that he won't be going back this afternoon. OFFICER: They're all accounted for. OK, lock it up. OK, take it up. OFFICER: Lunch is over, back to work! OK, move it out! Let's go, hurry it up! OK, I'm going to lunch. Burch, Miller's on. I'm taking off. BURCH: Lunch for me, too. I'll see you later. Kid, last chance. Boat comes at 2:00, are you in or out? Come here. Well, what is it? I don't know, Bernie. What about your folks? What about them? You ever hear from them? They don't know how to write. They don't visit either, huh? There's no money. Don't you ever want to see them again? Bernie, it's all I ever dream about. Look, kid. You know how many bars there are on the front of my cell? Twelve. You know how many steps it is from my cage to the yard door? 41. Know many cells there are in the corridor? Fourteen. I used to tell myself, when I run out of things to count, that's the day I start dying. Well I'm run out, kid. I'm run out a long time ago. And I am dying. So will you, you just don't know it yet. Is that what you want, to die an old man in this stink hole without ever seeing your folks again-- without ever seeing nothing? Is that what you want? Tell me you're in. Tell me. There's no killing. BERNIE: No killing. All right. I'll have you out of this cell in fifteen minutes. [KNOCKING] Let met out! Let me out! Let me out! Hey, calm down up there. I got to get out! Let me out! I don't want you to get into trouble. Will be quiet up there? [INAUDIBLE] trying to kill me! I want to get out! I want to get out! I want to get out of-- They're going to kill me. Let me out, please! Let me out! I want-- -What are you doing? Sam, put that thing out! Let me go! Burch, I'm having trouble with Shockley. Come over and cover me. Hey Bill, I'm going into D Block-- trouble with Shockley. I'll be right right. BILL: Have fun. The guy's a loony. SAM: I want out of here. Let me go! I'll burn it down! I'll burn it down! [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] I got permission to go for my yard time now. [HEAVY SIGH] OK, turn around. I said turn around, Hubbard. [GRUNTING] OK, that's enough. Get him into 403. Take it easy. You know, he's one of the few good screws around here. -I got it. -Yeah, it better work. It'll work. Keep an eye on Miller, kid. Hey, what's the chances they're going to have some hacks in that other gun galley down there? Not 'til after 4 o'clock. You and Crutch are going down, and keep an eye on a Sally port door for any screws coming through. I'll take care of any screws. You just get Burch. We got enough time, Bernie? If Crazy Sam can keep it up long enough, I'll make it. SAM: I'll kill you! I'll kill you! No, get away! [INAUDIBLE] -Move! -No! I'll kill you! I'll kill you, cowards! I'll kill you! OK. That a boy, Bernie. [SHOUTING] Let me out! The only thing you're going to get now is a dark cell with bread and water. Now, I tried to warn you! Just keep him locked up. We're out of backups. Oh, he'll get the hole for sure. Won't be the first time. Hey look, I gotta get back. Miller's all alone. I'll kill you! I'll kill you, cowards! Stay with us for a couple more minutes 'til he calms down. Get him. -What the hell-- -Hold it! I wouldn't do anything dumb, chief. I don't want to see you hurt. So why don't you walk real nice and easy over to 403, and I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Miller was waiting there for you, OK? What? I didn't hear you, Mr. Bristow. OK. OFFICER: OK Burch, coming down! Lageson! Lageson! [FOOTSTEPS] Hold it right there. Right this way, Mr. Lageson. We saved a spot for you. Got another one for you, kid. Go down and cover the Sally Port door. I'm going into D Block. Corwin? That's right, Mr. Corwin. I know you don't want to make me use this. So just open up that door there, and no one gets hurt. Slow and easy. Come on out of there. Easy, Dutch! Hey, mind your own business, grease-ball. You made it, Bernie! Bernie, let me out! I want Corwin! I'm going to kill Corwin! He got me wet, and I'm going to get him! Shut up! You're not killing anyone. Bernie! Dutch, you keep that halfwit in line, or he's not going anywhere. Look, just tell me how to get him out. Control panel, right behind you. Hold down the lever from Group to Individual, and then hit number 22. That's his cell. I'm out. I'm out! I'm out! I'm out! Here, grab this stuff. What about Burch? He's out colder than a mackerel. By the time he comes through, we'll be long gone. OK, I'm coming down. Is that you, Bernie? Thank you, Bernie! Thank you! [LOUD BANGING] It's running perfect, Bernie-- perfect. If the boat gets here on time. The boat's always on time. Just take it easy, Bill. Don't worry, Mr. Lageson. It's going to be OK. I never would have expected you to be in a fool thing like this, kid. We're doing all right so far. -You got Corwin in there? -Yeah. Yeah, well you get him out of there, because I'm going to-- --[INAUDIBLE] no one's to get hurt. Shut up! What are you talking to me lit that for, you brown skinned nigger? Dutch, you'd better get this crazy out of here before he gets hurt. Hey, enough! I don't like you, man. DUTCH: Hey! [INAUDIBLE]! What the hell's going on in here? He wanted me to give him one of the hacks. Dutch, I told you we need these guys. You've got to keep Sam in line. It was Corwin, he got me wet. Here, take this. Thanks. [PHONE RINGING] Mr. Lageson, I'm going to ask you for your watch. Sorry sir, but I'm on a time schedule-- 2 o'clock straight out. We're late. I built in an extra 10 minutes just in case. Sam, go get Thompson. Tell him we're getting ready to go. Marv, get 107 on that bunch of keys. They're going out the yard door. They can't, not without the key. Yeah, well they've got it. Well haven't they? BERNIE: Stroud? We got it. We're going straight through the yard down to the boat. Now how the hell would you do that? Hostages-- four guards-- you could still come, you know? What do you say? I was dumb enough to get into this joint, Bernie. I ain't crazy enough to try and break out. -Well we're going-- now. -Where, Bernie? That's the problem. Where? You think it's worth it? I tell you the God's truth. If I have to wake up one more morning in this seaman cage, nine by six, not even knowing if it's daylight outside, you better believe it's worth it. Just like I told you, Bernie. Good luck. That's 107? Look for yourself. Bill, how the devil did you end up with it? I know, I know-- I should have sent it back up to Burch, but he'd just left for lunch-- [DOOR OPENING] Give me the key. Sam, come on! Come on, come on-- get the key! All right, get on out there. Come on, get moving. Move it! Come on, move! Coy! It ain't there. Huh? 107-- the key to the door-- Hubbard says he can't find it. Marv? It's gotta be there. Bernie, I looked 10 times. It ain't here. Get up to the window. See if the boats here yet. You and Sam get over to Broadway by the cutoffs in case another screw comes through. You and Durando stay on them hacks. Boat just got in, Bernie. You find the key? Get Miller over here. [PHONE RINGING] Mr. Miller, I'm sorry if we hurt you. You've always been square with me. Now all you've got to do is tell us where it is. What? The yard key, number 107. In the key wrack up there. BERNIE: No, we brought them all down. There ain't no 107 here, now where is it? I don't know. Turn your pockets out. Pat him down, Marv. MARV: Right. No key, Bernie. BERNIE: Shoes-- take off your shoes. MILLER: I told you, Bernie. I don't have it. I want that key, Mr. Miller, else I'm going to have to use this. No you won't, Bernie. Cretzer might, or Buddy Thompson, or Crazy Sam for sure, but you're not a killer, Bernie. You never killed anyone. You don't have the stomach. OFFICER BURDETTE: Hey Bill, you go nuts or something? That-- That's right, Burdette. Don't move. Don't try anything. Good. Get him over there with the rest of them and search those other guards. Come on, move it! Keep an eye on that boat. Leave him alone! Coy! He hit me, Dutch! He hit me, Dutch! You get this straight. We need those screws! Nobody touches them. I ought to blow your head off. You're not the only one can blow heads off around here, Coy. They're starting to unload the boat! Get them back inside. Move it! Thompson, come with me. I want you to take each and every one of these keys, and try them in the yard door. They might have a duplicate with a dummy number on it. [PHONE RINGING] Anything wrong, Cliff? I'm trying to reach the phone in Cell Block C, but there's no answer. Well those chowhounds Miller and Lageson are probably down in the kitchen stealing donuts. Ring the dining hall. If there's no answer, I'll check it out. This is pretty, huh? Stuck here, all of us, with your stupid plan. MARV: What are you talking about? There was nothing wrong with the plan. Seven years Bernie was thinking this out. He's the only guy ever figured out how to get to those guns in that damn cage. Took him eight months to get them metal pieces out of the machine shop-- eight months hiding them in the toilet-- eight months starving himself so he could make it through them bars. Worked perfect, huh? Then why aren't we out of here right now? Why aren't we on a boat to Frisco? BERNIE: Rack it open. OK, let's go. Everybody out of the cell. Come on, move it. Wow, look who's here. It's the head screw himself. Where are my men? DURANDO: Don't worry, Captain.We'll take you to them right now. DUTCH: Move! Come on, let's go. We got another guest. Hey, you! I know you. You're the one who put me in isolation Hey Dutch, give me that gun. Hey, go ahead bean, I want you to. [GRUNTING] OK Sam that's enough. Get them out of the cell and over to the door. You too. Move! Get out! Come on, move! You walk fast-- you walk! What's the matter? It's jammed! One of the keys I cracked got stuck. I couldn't get it out. Even if we could, we got nothing. The boat just left. BUDDY: It's still stuck. DUTCH: Great, Coy-- just great. We finally get 107, now we can't get the other damn key out. We might as well forget it, Buddy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, got it out! What the hell difference does it make? The boat's gone. -Now wait a minute. Wait just a second. Suppose we got that boat back again. You think they're going to bring the boat back for us? DUTCH: If they had to-- if we got some of those wives and kids for hostages. Wives and kids? We don't go straight to the dock. We go the other way, where the screws live. BERNIE: Hey Dutch, now hold on a minute. IF we had them as hostages, they'd give us anything we wanted. You know, what he's saying makes sense. Yeah. We've come this far, by God. Do we get some women now, Dutch? Shut up! Let's take a walk. Hubbard, you and Durando get back to the cutoff. DUTCH: So? It can't be done without taking out the tower screws. We got hostages! Yeah, if we're headed for the boat, the screws wouldn't touch us. But once we start going for their families right here on the rock, they'll start shooting, hostages or not. OK, we take them out. Yeah, sure. All we got to do is ice one screw, and we're all dead, every one of us. They'll never stop hounding us down. They never will, anyway. There's another way. Put them out of commission-- wound them. Sure, I didn't know we had a Buffalo Bill in this little outfit. Who the hell can shoot that good? I can. I grew up hunting squirrels. I can pick a man's finger off at 100 feet. It's too risky. Look, no one's dead yet. As long as we've got the threat of killing someone, we just might get out of here. This one better work Bernie. I can't see anyone. Nobody's come back. I'd feel a lot better if we had guns. No guns in the cell house. [INAUDIBLE]. Open it up. Coy! Get back at the desk! Bill, what the hell's the matter with you? Gentlemen, we'll take those clubs. Bernie, behind you! Sorry, Mr. Sondstrum, but you're going to have to join the party. I don't see a thing. Warden Johnston, this is Officer Fish at the Armory. Sir, I think we've got some real trouble at the Cell House. Get it there. We going now? Look, kid. I told you there wasn't going to be any shooting. Well I can't keep that promise. Some guards are going to get hurt. So, well, you can still pull out. Why don't we both pull out? Nah, it's too late for me. After this, I'd be in solitary 'til the day I die. Well? No one's treated me square like you, Bernie. I feel like I'm letting you down. Hey, kid. Don't worry about anything. We just had a couple of slip ups. But I'm getting out, see. I'm going home. -Good luck, man. -Yeah? I guess we could use a little of that. So long, man. So long, kid. I'll send you a post card. The hell was that, good luck? Is he pulling out? You going to let that yellow bellied spic-- Look, he's out, Dutch. He can do what he wants, and he wants out. Five minutes, that's all I need. Five minutes, and we'll be outta here. [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] All right, let's move. Get those guards out. Buddy, you got 107 now. I Get that door open. Warden, we got three guards down at the watchtowers wounded. Kick on the siren. [SIREN] DUTCH: Get on out of there. Out, out, come on! Come on! Come on, move! Let's go! Come on! Are we open yet, Buddy? It ain't turning! Is that key 107? Yeah. Then it's got to turn. It's got to turn. Come on! Damn! We just got a report, sir. They've spotted Dutch Cretzer with a gun. Cretzer? My God, he'd kill his own mother to get out of here. They must have sprung him out of lock up, God knows how many others. How many guards do we have on the Cell House floor right now? Nine, plus Burch in the gun gallery. We haven't heard from any of them. [BUZZER] MAN ON PHONE: General Stilwell on the line, sir. Joe Stilwell? MAN ON PHONE: Yes sir, he heard the siren over at San Francisco. He wants to know if you want him to send over the Marines. General Stilwell, this is Warden Johnston. I gratefully accept your offer. DUTCH: Nothing-- not one damn thing has gone right since the beginning. Face it, Coy. This is a bust. The whole damn thing's a bust! You know, they're going to be here any time, now. No, not while we've still got those nine screws. Maybe I could call the warden, see what he wants to swap for them. Hey, that's great. Maybe we can get a airplane. Oh shut up, Sam. You tell him we got to get that boat. OK, you tell him that, Coy. Yeah, that's it-- the boat. Dutch-- this ain't right, Dutch. You're getting like everybody else. You don't listen to anything I say. All right, Sam. I'm sorry. Still, it ain't right. BERNIE: Give me the warden. Bernie Coy-- he's calling from the Cell House, line 3. Coy? Yeah. Warden, I'm sorry to trouble you, sir. But I think we're ready to talk some business here. WARDEN JOHNSTON: Now you listen to me, Coy. Any arrangements I might make will have to be based on the proven fact that my officers are still alive. We got them. You'll see them. Believe me, we don't want any killing. Just bring the boat back. WARDEN JOHNSTON: What? We want the boat at the dock now. Well I can't put out an order like that without permission from Washington. Well they still haven't gone through the yard door. Suppose they have the key? If they got into the gun cage, they have it. But they haven't used it. I wonder. The lock is designed to jam if the key isn't used properly. Do you suppose that-- No, I don't think we can count on that. I'm sending an assault team into the gun cage. They can draw whatever weapons they want, but absolutely no guns on the Cell House floor. Yes, sir. Damn it, are we getting the boat? We'll get it! I say we kill one of these hacks, so them we mean business. Look Dutch, get this straight. We're not killing anyone-- anyone! Now I'm going over and make sure they're not sending somebody in on the other side. You stay here and keep our buddies company, OK? Here you go, Bernie. One in the chamber. Be right back. Hey, where are you going? Bernie said to stay right here. No kidding. You know, I don't take orders from anybody. Do you understand? I said, do you understand? OFFICER: Quick, get Burch out of there. What the hell? Did you see that? They just started firing away, no warning at all. Thank God I gave them a taste of their own medicine. Cretzer, so help me, if you've killed one of them guards-- You really love those screws, don't you? BERNIE: We been waiting, warden. No boat, no deal. I told you, you don't go killing one of my officers and try to bargain your way out of it. What are you talking about? Nobody's been killed. I made certain of that. Officer Stykes-- he's dead. They carried him down from the gun gallery. Now right now-- you give yourself up right now, or we're coming in, Coy. We'll kill you, and Cretzer, and every other damn con that's had a hand in this. That's the deal! Leave the lights out in the Cell House. As soon as it gets dark, we'll try to pull our men out. You just had to show them, didn't you? You just had to show them what a big shot you are? What's eating you? A clean break wasn't good enough for you. No, you had to shoot yourself a screw. So? Look, if I killed a screw, he had it coming. Sure, and you lost us our last chance to get out of here. No, your last chance, you-- [SHOUT] BERNIE: Get back! Back up, Sam. OK, how you want it to be, Dutch? You us to start killing each other, or you want to bust out? -I-- I want out of here. -OK. Give him back the gun, Marv. I'll kill him. Not Coy-- the guards. Hm? If one of those screws gets out here alive, we're all going to the chair. They know exactly who we are. I got to spell it out for you? Dutch, he's right. They got to die, all of them. We got to kill them all. BUDDY: Kill them now, Dutch, before it's too late. SAM: And kill Corwin first. Get in front of me, quick. SAM: Because he's the one how got my shirt wet! DUTCH: Ah, shut up, Sam! I got to think! BUDDY: You don't got the guts to do it, I will. DUTCH: Guts? Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Who do you think crashed out of McNeal and killed a Federal Marshal-- a Federal Marshal! SAM: Then kill them, Dutch! Then kill all of them! Just kill every one of them! Do it, Dutch! Now! Who's first, Dutch! Huh, you creep? You're a [INAUDIBLE]! You're a-- [GUN SHOTS] Stay out of it, Bernie. Stay out of it. What can you do? It's over now. [GUN SHOTS] Hey Dutch, I ought to go to D Block and tell the guys these screws are dead, huh? You hear me, Dutch? Leave me alone. Hey, Dutch, it's me. It's Sam. Dutch, it's Sam. Leave me alone, you stupid halfwit! Just get out of here. Well, what are you looking at? They're dead. They're all dead. Beat it. Beat it. Bernie, you all right? You feeling all right? So close-- we came so close. Look, it ain't over yet. Hell, we'll think of something. Honest, you look terrible, Bernie. You ought to-- you ought to eat something. [INAUDIBLE]. [LOUD CLAMORING] Bernie, easy. I had it all planned out. I had all-- I don't know. I just don't know. Well you got to rest. You haven't slept in days, have you? Here, come on. It's OK, come on. Get up here. It's going to be OK. You know what I've been wondering, Bernie? I been wondering how a couple of hillbillies like us wound up here. Darn hillbillies. [INAUDIBLE] No, I know what you mean. You got the whole thing all figured out. How to get through them bars and everything. I mean, that was really smart. Yeah, I'm a genius, all right. So damn smart, I picked Cretzer to help us out. Yeah, well it should have been just you, and me, and the kid. Shoulda been. That's what we are now. Just a couple of shoulda beens. Come on, old buddy. You just rest a while. You just rest easy. We've already put men in the east gun gallery. I want both of you in the west gallery. Let's go. I want you other men to cover the whole Cell House until you find those captured officers. Do we go in unarmed, sir? Our security has always depended on keeping guns off the Cell House floor. I am not going to change that principle now. However, you will be covered from both gun cages above. When you find those captured officers, do nothing else but bring them out as quickly as possible. [GUN SHOTS] It's all right, Joe. We're getting you out right now. [GUN SHOTS CONTINUE] [DOOR CLOSES] Kid? Kid, me and you got to talk. Listen to me. We got to come up with some kind of a story, OK? You and me, we got to alibi each other. Because they're talking about-- we killed these guards. Oh, get out. No, listen to me. Get out of here! OK. I tell you what. When they ask me who killed those guards, I'm going to tell them that the whole plan was yours. The whole plan was yours. Bill Miller passed away this morning. They think Corwin's going to make it, but Weinhold and Simpson are both still critical. The others should be OK. What's this? Lageson wrote these names in the cell where they were held. Coy, Cretzer, Thompson, Shockley, Hubbard-- Durando? Yeah-- yeah, that surprised me. Well, now we know who they are. And we know how many. But how do we get to them? General Stilwell, thank you for coming, sir. Warden Johnston, General Merrill. -Warden. -An honor, sir. Sit down, gentlemen. Radio reports in San Francisco say the convicts have sub-machine guns shooting up everything they can see. No, I'm happy to say that's an exaggeration. They're all still in the Cell House? -Mm-hm. -How many? Six, and there's no way they can get out. Both entries are covered. A search and destroy operation could wrap this up in an hour. I'm afraid that's not possible, General. No firearms are allowed on the floor of the Cell House. But surely in this kind of situation-- WARDEN JOHNSTON: I'm sorry, General. But I can't take a chance of any more weapons falling into the hands of those killers. Are you telling me you want to take them from the outside? Yes. That means grenades, launchers, maybe mortar fire, the works. MERRILL: Seems the hard way to me, Warden. Are you sure you're prepared? I'm sorry, but that's the way it'll have to be. You're going to sustain structural damage. Mm-hm, I'm prepared for that. Do you have any plan of the Cell House? Yes, right over here, gentlemen. The cell-blocks, dining area, kitchen, recreation yard-- What's this? Utilities corridor-- they run down the center of each block. Do you know where the convicts are now? Our best guess is that they've all gone over to D Block here. It's walled in, and they might think it's safer. All right, we'll start there against these windows. Frank, what's the name of that officer on the base who cleaned out those Japanese caves on Bougenville? Buckner-- Charlie Buckner. Get him. Gentlemen, I can't thank you enough. I've had at least two of my men dead and eleven wounded. And I don't give a damn if we kill every last one of those animals. I can't believe it. He's turning a minor mop up job into a major battle. Yes, but it's his island, Frank. You sure had yourself a good sleep, Bernie. Well, I don't feel like it. What do you think, Bernie? Think they'll try sending in a bunch of screws this morning? They'll try something, that's for sure. Want me to role you one? Yeah, thanks. Bernie, you know that picture you painted? The-- the old shack by the side of the road? Yeah. MARV: Where was that place? LaRue County, Kentucky. I grew up in that shack. Got it off an old photo daddy gave me. You wouldn't believe how beautiful that place was-- the Indian Summer, all red and gold, and leaves falling everywhere, like walking on a carpet, you know? Sometimes the leaves would get so thick over the creek, you couldn't even see the water. It was really something. You sure got a talent. You think so? Honest to God. Here you go. Thanks. [VOICES OUTSIDE] SOLDIER: Attention! Prepare to load weapons! Load weapons! Aim! Any further contact, Bergen? All quiet here, sir. All right, pass the word. We're going to open fire. SOLDIER: Load weapons! Aim! Ready, pull! [EXPLOSIONS] [SHOUTING] Let us out of here, you dirty, wet, stinking screws! Let us out of here! Get us out of here! [EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE] They're firing grenades. Honest to God, Bernie. [SHOUTING] SOLDIER: Cease fore! [GRUNTS] Damn, it's no use. We can't break through here without some heavy mortars. Looks like they stopped. [GUN SHOT] Bernie? Damn, I'm hit! Oh geez, well get your hand away from there. Let me see. Oh boy! I know, it hurts like hell. I been shot up plenty myself. Bullet went clean through, but it still is going to hurt for a spell. Thanks for the news. You know what helps? Aspirin. Honest, and we got plenty of-- Marv, do me a favor. Sure, Bernie. Get that rifle over there, and get me out here. -Ready? -Uh-huh. Let's go. [GUN SHOT] Sir, Mr. Bennett just called again from Washington. He's concerned about the plan to use mortar fire. We have to. The grenades won't penetrate. I told him that, sir. But he's worried about the public reaction if some innocent prisoners are killed. You tell Bennett there are no innocent prisoners in Alcatraz. We will start the mortar attack as soon as General Merrill here tells me his men are ready. Should be 45 minutes to an hour. OFFICER: Excuse me, sir. But one of the men in the west gun gallery spotted Cretzer on top the cell-block. Must have crawled up there through the utilities corridor. That's a great spot for a sniper. If you don't mind, Warden, my man Buckner knows how to handle snipers. No, he'd never get a clean shot at him up there. There's a roof over the Cell Block, isn't there? Go to it, General. One other thing, sir. The press is getting pretty sore about being kept in the dark. Tell them-- tell them six mad dogs are on the loose, and we're going to stop them. Use those words-- mad dogs. [GUN SHOTS] SOLDIER: Commence firing! [EXPLOSIONS] Bernie, I'll be right back. Listen to me! We have no guns! There are no guns in D Block! You're going to kill all of us! Are you dumb, or what? You hear me? Tell them! Stroud gave his word, Warden. He swears there aren't any guns in D Block. And frankly, his word has always been good. You mean, he's too smart to lie. All right, tell General Merrill to cease fire. At least maybe his men on the roof can get a shot at Cretzer. What about the others? All we know is that Coy and Hubbard are pinned down in the utility corridor. Let's make sure they stay that way. Oh noble, kindly president of this great country, please pardon us. We'd love to fight for love and liberty. [LAUGHING] We marked the place over here, Mr. Buckner. We're directly above the west section of C Block. -Right here? -Right here. [DRILLING] I found a tunnel going down to the cutoff to the corridor on the east side of C. [DRILLING] What the hell is that? [GUN SHOT] Stay back! Sir, just got word that Corwin, Weinhold, and Lageson are all going to pull through. Thank God. General Merrill says his man broke through the roof. He's ready to blast Cretzer out of there. It's getting dark again. Tell him we'll wait 'til daylight when we can see what we're doing. Then we'll take the whole bunch of them. You ever wonder, Bernie-- I mean, what it would be like if you was born rich? My daddy always told me I was born bad, so I guess I still would have wound up here. Yeah. [COUGHING] No offense to your daddy, but ain't nobody born bad. Not even Cretzer and Shockley? No, not born. Did you ever think you were going to end up in a cell? Is that what you wanted? No. No, but I was willing to chance it to get what I did want. What was it you wanted so bad? Well, at the very first it was glasses. Glasses? WARDEN JOHNSTON: I couldn't see good in school. Couldn't afford to buy me any, so I stole me some money to buy me some. And that's what started it. Honest, my only regret-- I wish I could have done better for my wife and little ones. What about you, Bernie? You got a family? Somewheres, I guess. [COUGHING] Hill folk-- all I ever got from my daddy was a whipping. All I ever got from my mamma was her bad teeth. I tell you, Marv. If we'd known each other when we were kids, we would have mad a sorry pair. Huh? Your eyes, and my teeth. [LAUGHING] Yeah. SOLDIER: [INAUDIBLE]. [EXPLOSION] No, I can't seem him at all. He must have ducked into the utility corridor. OK, thanks. OK, don't worry about it. We'll get him. [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] MARV: Hey, Bernie? BERNIE: Huh? MARV: Let's get to the tunnel. [GRUNTING] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] We'll be OK here. Sure, we'll die here like gophers. [EXPLOSION] [GUN SHOTS] Who they shootin' at now? I'll give you ten to one it's Cretzer, if he's still alive. Sir, we're getting gun fire at the east end of the Cell House on the cell-block roof. Do the men in the gun gallery have grenades? Use 'em. I want a team to stand by with riot guns. You're sending guns into the Cell House? Have them ready at the Sally port door. Grenades first, and then we'll be going in. I want no warnings. Hit hard, and hit fast. If we have to, we'll blast them all to hell. [GUN SHOTS] One things for sure. They know we're down here. What's up ahead? MARV: It's just the other corridor. East door-- it's the east door. It's near the Sally port. We get ourselves a couple of screws-- -Bernie. -We can still get out of here. Bernie, I think we're all washed up. -No! -Bernie, listen to me. -No, I'm tellin' ya! -Bernie-- Come on, we gotta keep going. We still got a chance. I'm gettin' outta here. [FAINT EXPLOSIONS] MARV: Bernie, listen to me. BERNIE: I'm going home. MARV: Bernie-- BERNIE: I'm going home! Home. [MUSIC PLAYING] DUTCH: You damn hillbilly, it's your fault! It's your fault! [GUN SHOTS] [DOOR OPENING] [GUN SHOTS] [GRUNTING] I wasn't there! I wasn't there! [SHOUTING] -Hey, what happened to Coy? -Dead. NARRATOR: Buddy Thompson and Sam Shockley were executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin. The body of Dutch Cretzer was claimed by his ex-wife and cremated. Durando's life was spared because of his youth. He was paroled in 1973. Marvin Hubbard's body was sent home to Alabama for burial. No one claimed Bernie Coy's body, and, at government expense, he was interred in a San Francisco cemetery in an unmarked grave.
