Turn out the lights. What are you try to intimidate me? Is that it? I thought we were going around with each other. Shit, Ricardo, after six months you'd think you trust me by now. This is bullshit.

Why the hell did you have them on, asshole? I was staking you out, bitch. Shit, Ricardo, you were just dicking me around to try to scare me. I said, don't screw me. Baby, I'd rather screw a broken window, OK? RICARDO: Who's the muscle? It's my insurance policy. You got the cash? You think I'm here for the company? Then, let's have a look.

GILS: Good work, guys. All right. I just off the horn with Gils. He busted this guy, Casanova, a few years ago. He says the guy is a real womanizer, a sex fiend. He has six different counts of rape against him. The guy's an easy hook. And I guess I'm the bait, right? [music playing] You think he's our rapist? If he rapes her he's our rapist. [laughter] I guess so. [music playing] Oh, you like it rough. You know something? She too said, I love you when you like it rough, darling. [spanish] CASANOVA: Did you know that? Tell me about her. She used to love me. Now, you just get on your knees. (YELLING) Get on your knees. What else you gonna do with that scarf? CASANOVA: I'm gonna to show you about a real man, darling. I love a man in control. Can you believe this shit? You know, she said she loved me. She always said she love me. Can believe this douche bag slut? Look at her. Would you believe I asked her out two times and both times she turned me down? She brushed me right off. Yeah, me too. Made me feel like shit, the bitch. [moan] [music playing] Come up for air. Come up for air. Woah. Now, this is romance. I think she's enjoying herself. I'll say. Don't you-- [laughs] Aw, shit. You make any noise, you scream, I'm gonna make you bleed. I'm gonna cut you.

Stupid fucking bitch. [laughs] [music playing] I love you. [laughs] [screaming] [music playing] [gun shots] Get on the radio. Get us some backup. Did you hear me? (YELLING) Did you hear me? Shit.

I love this woman. She got time, baby. [mwah] Blue, where you at? I want you now. I know where you go, blue. Your move. [laughs] [ugh] [music playing] Hey, hold on. Malcolm. Malcolm. [coughs] [music playing] MALCOLM: Damn it, those three have gone too far this time. And why aren't they dead yet? DANTE: Listen, Malcolm. I don't care how much you want these people dead. I can't just go out there and kill three police officers. It has to be done right and that takes time. Let me tell you something, my friend, I don't pay you and others like you to take your time. DANTE: You know, you have a bigger problem down in Mexico with Cesar. He wants his million dollars, and he's had it with your sniper attacks. My business with Cesar can wait. What's most important to me is the revenge of my brother's death. DANTE: I know that, but I don't think you understand that Cesar has tipped off the DEA, and they are now planning a raid on the nightclub. I think we should deal with that first. Maybe the three police officers could be caught in the crossfire of the raid. MALCOLM: Fine. But you listen to me, detective Dante. You make it happen any way you want, because if it doesn't happen, I promise you, my friend, I will personally see that something happens to you. [music playing] [phone ringing] [music playing] [phone ringing] Thank you. [typewriter clicks] Dante, DEA [phone ringing] STARK: I believe these three will make the best unit for your operation. [phone ringing] DANTE: These are my choices. What do you want a suicide mission? Sloan, Cuff and Weston have recently been transferred to this department with active suspension papers. I mean, there-- there's a reason why the LAPD took their guns out of their hands. Why those three? The DEA has gone over your files. My office feels that these three individuals are the best people for the job. The DEA would appreciate your cooperation. Cooperation? What the hell do you want to know? What do you know about these people personally? How all three graduated from the top of their class at the Academy. They all went to school together. They all grew up in the same neighborhood. And Billy Sloan, he is the most recent addition to the precinct. Sloan is a weapons and explosives expert, served a tour in the Marines, saw a battle, decorated. He flew helicopter missions to recover POWs, not married, no family, expert marksman. Cuff is an expert in all areas of martial arts, karate, judo, state kickboxing champion. Most of his early years work centered around gang activity. The only family he had was a younger brother who was killed in a drive-by shooting two years ago. Ali Weston graduated law school before entering the Academy, father was a cop. She wanted to be a cop. Father died in the line of duty when she was 15. The mother is in some hospital on life support. Other than her two visits a week to the hospital, she buries herself in work. [typewriter clicking] These three have had the most active files since they left the Academy. These three I feel the worse for your operation. Since joining the force, I mean, they've had a following of dead bodies everywhere they've gone. Collectively, they've lost two partners in the line of duty and seven injured. Thanks for your recommendation, Captain Stark. [typewriter clicking] [music playing] [telephone ringing] Sit down, Mr. Cuff. You have been chosen as a surveillance unit regarding a major drug operation in this city. The purpose of your unit has been based on your past records, your friendship, and the fact that this department has found it virtually impossible to assign any of you a partner. So we've decided to let you renegades work together. Sit down Mr. Sloan. I don't need this shit. What shit is that? SLOAN: This renegade shit, this finding me a partner shit. If you got an assignment assign it, but don't give me this shit. Nobody else created this shit, Mr. Sloan. Sit down. Nobody else in the squad has more partner casualties than you with the exception of miss Weston. Miss. The department issued you a gun. You pulled the trigger. Now, whether you like it or not, this is the last stop. Either you play by my rules or you don't play at all. It's up to you. [phone ringing] What's the matter with you, huh? You never tell these assholes what you're thinking. You know better than that. You're right, Tommy. You're always right. Well, when you're right, you're right. And when you're wrong, you're wrong. Right? What's it been, two years? Two years. Feels like two days. Some things never change. And some things do. How's your wife, Tommy? Great. The only thing that's missing is a couple of dogs and a white picket fence. How's your husband? I'm not married. Oh, that's too bad. I'm sorry. I'm not. I missed you guys. [chuckles] Oh, boy. What are we going to do, huh? They got me stuck behind a desk. I'm going to go crazy if I don't see some action. I say we take it. Can you take it, councilor? I think we found our leader. All right, let's get started. OK, there'll be no backup unit on this team. That would only put you in jeopardy. Our sources inform us that the shipment is leaving the country in the next 24 hours. Starting now that you're on your own. How you do this is your business. Dismissed. [ominous music playing] So you think they're going to make it? [music playing] Good evening, ladies. [music playing] WOMAN: Wait 'til you guys see this place. It's a real trip. Hello, ladies. How are you? I'm doing great. Step right in. Have a beautiful time. - Hey, what's up? - Nothing's up. Just relax. [music playing] CUFF: Don't let it get away from you, huh? VALET: I'll try not to you. CUFF: Busy night, huh? VALET: Yeah, sure is. CUFF: Here's a little donation for the Bouncer's Club of America. LOUDMOUTH: Hey, there's a line back here. Hey man, I've been waiting two hours to get in this place. I'm going to give you a three count to get your hand off me. 1, 2. [fighting] [inaudible] WOMAN: Who was that guy? [music playing] Thanks for the compliment, but, uh, I prefer blondes. [music playing] So do I. Your loss. [music playing] You still have a thing for Billy, huh? You had me, but you want him. Go forward, Tommy. Life moves forward. OK, how many ducks? Two at the bar. Woman on the rafter, one on the left. [ominous music playing] All right. Let's rock and roll. [ominous music playing] All right. That's enough. We're moving. Come on, move. Come on, let's go. Go. [music playing] [gun shots] [music playing] Come on, move. [music playing] [gun shots] RADIO: Everyone stay sharp. We've got badges in the house. [gun shots] [screaming] [gun shots] Greencall, you copy? Yeah, what's up? RADIO: Undercover LAPD coming out the front, captain. [screaming] [gun shots] [music playing] [screaming] MAN: There goes the dealer with the shit. Hey, woah, woah, take it. It's yours, man. It's yours. [gun shots] [music playing] [police sirens] RADIO DISPATCH: [inaudible] for a 128. I don't appreciate being woken up in the middle of the night. My wife doesn't appreciate it. She's a suspicious woman as it is. And I don't need shit from her. I don't need shit from you three. Internal Affairs 7:00 AM tomorrow morning. Stone and Dante want to ask you three a few questions. And don't be late, please. Just a quiet place, just the place to be. What are you working at? Get out of-- get out of my face. [phone ringing] Aw, fuck. Internal Affairs, huh? SLOAN: Yeah, that's the least of it, pal. So how many times you call her in one night? What? You have baller, right? What-- what-- what-- what is this, huh? Hey, man, the chips are down. I'm gonna a leak. You OK? (YELLING) Hey. You OK? SLOAN: I'm good tom, tom. Yeah, I don't blame him. What am I getting with this shit? What am I getting from you? What-- what-- Nothing, man. Nothing. Hey. [music playing] RADIO: What police officials have described as a tragic event has claimed the lives of a dozen people at club X in the trendy warehouse district of the city tonight. Again, raising questions over the use of excessive force by members of the LAPD. Tommy Cuff, Billy Sloan, and Ali Weston were officers involved in what is rapidly being described as the massacre of the innocents. Nine innocent patrons of the club X nightclub were gunned down during the crossfire. Top level officials are claiming that the officers were not on duty and were acting on their own accord. The three officers have been suspended pending an investigation. Internal Affairs refuses to comment on who will be leading the inquiry. What is this shit, huh? Is this legal? Anything's legal when you're dealing with the people who make the rules. So what are we going to do? Issue a statement before this looks any God damn worse? I don't know. I really don't know what to advise. All that law school and you're crapping out on us? Hey, it's a chess game. And we shouldn't make a move until we know who we're playing with. So what, we wait? Yeah. [music playing] WESTON: Don't Look at him. Don't even look at him. I'm not doing anything. Anybody catch the news tonight? BAR CROWD: Yeah. Yeah. LARRY: Is today February 14th? Hey, Tommy, is today February 14th? Come on. You're not going to answer me? I'm asking you a question. Is today February 14th? Don't answer him. LARRY: Tommy Cuff, is today February 14th? Don't answer him. What'd you like in the 3rd one? LARRY: Hey, Tommy, I'm asking you a question. Shove you're gold bat up your ass, Larry. SLOAN: There we go. WESTON: That's great. Batter up. That will aid in avoiding conflict. Tough guy. Tough guy. Cobody A cocktail for my enemies. We're celebrating tonight. Keep the change. [music playing] Let it go. Come on, let's get out of here. OK, look, I just want to thank your brother, Eric. OK, really. LARRY: Cheers, Tommy. Larry, I really don't want a drink from you. Thanks anyway. What's the matter? Not celebrating Valentine's Day with us after that massacre you pulled? I feel like Al Capone still lives. How many kids you make orphans, huh folks? Once an asshole, always an asshole, Larry. Tommy Cuff and the guy that could shoot straight. [gun noises] Hey, pal. Next time you start your car, think twice. You're another one, Sloan. You fucking kook lover. Tommy. Huh. My old man always said, there's no room for slacks in blue. [music playing] [bar chatter] LARRY: Fuck off you mother fucking-- WESTON: Come on Larry. CUFF: Fuck this asshole. LARRY: Fuck you though. SLOAN: What are you gonna do, huh? Oh. Yeah, come on Larry, get him. Yes, Larry. BAR CROWD: Come on. Don't let him get away with it, man. Larry, come on, man. What's going on? Stand up. Stand up, man. [fighting] Fucking jerk. Fuck off. Hey, dickhead, we're all cops here. You really think you're doing some work here, huh? Shut up. If you want to keep your job, you'll a release officer Cuff, go outside, get in your car, and drive away. OK? Yes sir. And I don't want to see one scratch on him. Yes, sir. [music playing] What was that, our guardian angel? Or the devil in disguise. [music playing] I just can't do this anymore. [music playing] Mr. Mitchell, we'll be talking to each one of you individually. If I were you, I'd clear your schedules for the rest of the day. Sloan, you're up. [typewriter clicking] William Sloan, James D. Mitchell, FBI. Your full name is Will Marcelow, is that correct? William Robert Sloan. Can I call you Bill? Can I call you Jim? Tell us what happened, Bill? Do you know how many people got killed last night? I've seen a lot of people get killed. So you mean you don't know. Is that it, Sloan? I've seen a lot of people killed. You've served in the military, correct? Navy seals. Would you consider yourself a trained assassin? I did what my country asked me to do. You do consider this your country? Lately? What do you mean, what are you referring to? The press being told that we acted on our own last night. No statement was released from this office. Well, sometimes branches of government have been known to do their own thing to ensure the peace. - We did get the bad guys. - And some good ones. CUFF: I guarantee you that the bullets that killed all those people all came from called bags and security. What happened to the money? What money $100 thousand. I stuffed it down my bra. Bullets were flying every which fucking way. I didn't see any money. [music playing] STONE: Officer Cuff, it says in your report you fought with a club patron before entering. CUFF: Yeah. Well, this guy was mouthing off in line, and since I was undercover, I thought it would be appropriate to bust his ass. Now, what does this got to do with what happened inside club X? SLOAN: No, for the third time, I'll telling you. I heard small arms fire, which sounded like 9 millimeter semi-autos going off. I turned and fired. STONE: I'm running a check on his military records right now. I need a psych profile. Right. Sloan, William Robert. Did you shoot the two officers? I've seen a lot of people killed. What did you see last night? There was a car crash. CUFF: I was driving the car. SLOAN: Chemicals that were transporting exploded in the car. WESTON: The cars were on fire. I remember people screaming. Then, I heard shots. Then, I heard shots Then, I heard shots You're all officially suspended until this investigation is concluded. You have to undergo psychological testing and be available at all times for questioning. 12 innocent people have been killed. An undercover DEA agent is dead. $100,000 in government funds are missing. And two uniformed patrol officers answering a disturbance are also dead. Until we get this story straight, one version, none of you is to talk to the press or any other outside agency. To do so would incur a suspicion of guilt. And guilt in this case, in this state, could get you the gas chamber. You're dismissed. Any idea who could have leaked to the press about being their being on their own. How the hell do I know? You know how the press is. Hm. [music playing] [screaming] [music playing] What did you tell them? Nothing. I didn't remember anything. Dead is dead. Half the time I don't even realize when I pulled the trigger and when I don't. I only remember the fire burning, that's it. What are you two gonna do? I don't think we've got much of a choice, Billy. Just sit tight and wait out the storm. Ali, suspension is one thing, but without pay. Well, at least you got the security gig. You know, that's something. Yeah, right. Something. Shit, what day is today? Thursday. I gotta go see my mother. If you need anything call me. Listen, I really think that the best thing is not to talk to anyone. See you. What a waste. So what happened to you? Who knows. Take it easy with that drink, Billy. Listen, I'm going to go and do some working out. You want to come along? [chuckle] No, man. I got to go wherever the hell it is I work, because, Tommy, I need something. Need A? Few bucks? Fuck no. If you need some money, I got some extra cash. No. Get out of here. Look, Billy, come on. Billy. You all right? Fine. CUFF: You sure? Life is fine. CUFF: Call you later. Hey, come by, huh? Bring a little take out. I got to talk. [music playing] Hey, Maddie. This is for you. Put the rest on the house, huh. Please? [music playing] [baby crying] And in the massacre of innocence case, police officials are refusing to comment on the actions of officers Thomas Cuff, William Sloan, and Allison Weston. But on the other hand, the victims' families and friends are speaking out loud and clear. She was just 17, I mean, she was here celebrating her birthday, and her friends brought her down. She didn't have to die like this. These cops have got to pay. They can't just go around shooting every damn time they get a chance. She was just 17. All my husband ever wanted to be was a cop. Precinct 65 was his home away from home. He was a very good provider, and he would have made a good father. He didn't deserve to die. He didn't. [music playing] [crying] He didn't deserve to die. He didn't. I'm not coming back, mom. I can't stand to see you like this anymore. It's killing me. I love you too much. [music playing] Tommy, it's Mary. You'll be hearing from my lawyer next week. Look, I'm sorry. I had to hit you all at once, but it's got to be done. Please don't call me. If you have anything to say, please just say it through the lawyer all right. [door bell rings] Tommy, I've got a message from precinct 65. [music playing] [fighting] Hold him down. If they don't find you guilty, next time it will be loaded. OK, fellas, let's go. [music playing] This is really arousing me. Oh, God. Obviously, you kept your key. Stupid son of a bitch, what the hell is wrong with you? Look, I had no place to go, OK. Three men try to end my thriving career to tine my home. Yeah, by the looks of my door, we're all building a little fan club. Drink? No, thanks. How about some ice, huh? Florence Nightingaleing it in that. Never wanted to be. ANSWERING MACHINE: An eye for an eye. We know where you live. It's only a matter of time. You date really strange men. WESTON: Funny. ANSWERING MACHINE: Murders should be murdered. I'm gonna be watching and waiting for you, bitch. WESTON: Obviously, I need to get an unlisted number. Well, maybe I would have been safer at my own place. SLOAN: Ali, you there? Pick up. It's all over. It really hurts. I'm sorry, Ali. I don't mean to leave you guys for this, but I have no choice. I can't sit tight. Tell Tommy I'm sorry. [music playing] Billy. Hey, Billy. What's up Billy boy? Tommy? CUFF: Yeah, it's me, Billy. I'm glad it's Tommy. Hey, I'm glad it's you. Come on in. Can't do that. I'm not going to help you blow your brains out. What? Hey, come on in. Hey, it's not loaded all right. I don't buy that. SLOAN: Look, I've just made some fresh coffee. It's nice and hot. Did you bring that take out, man? Come on. Get your ass in here buddy. You can't do this to us. What the hell did you bring her for? Hey, we were going to discuss this together, right buddy? We're in this together. So Ali, come on, huh? Come on in. It's not loaded. Come on. Don't be a stranger. Get your ass in his solider. Come on. Hey, it's not loaded. It's not loaded. - I'm going in. - No, you're not going in. You believe him? He said, it's not loaded. I know what he said, but he's sick. I know him. - (YELLING) No, I know him. (YELLING) No. Hey, Billy, you OK? Hey, I know you. Did you come buy me some coffee? No I don't want any. Empty. Hey, Tom Tom, I told you it was, huh. If you can't believe your friends, who can you believe? What am I gonna do with this guy, huh? (YELLING) What am I doing with this guy? Knock it off, Tommy. Just leave them alone. You stay out of this, OK. Just stay out of it. You want to die, Billy, huh? I'll kill you myself, you fuck. You want to leave us alone in this mess, huh? (YELLING) Well, Fuck you, man. We're in this together, all three of us. Open your eyes, all right, Tommy. The ship is sinking. We are going down. That's what the public want and just because things are so fucked up, that's what the public are going to get. One way or the other, legal or illegal. Now, asshole on the street is responsible for my life. This believe it or not it's my own responsibility. And if I so choose to blow my fucking brains out, this, I believe, is my right also. Shit, we're all going to go down if we don't make a move now. STARK: I don't want to hear it. How could you have let those three handle this assignment. STARK: Don't give me crap about this shit, huh. I told that pompous ass Dante that these were the worst three for the assignment, and he wouldn't listen. You mean you didn't recommend Cuff, Sloan, or Weston. What are you crazy? Look, this is your problem, you handle it. Oh, uh, by the way, tell Dante he made a great call on this one. MALCOLM: What the hell is wrong with you? 10 men armed with assault rifles, and you can't take out these three. There's a backup plan in effect. - Backup plan? What are you, an idiot? Back up plan? Your last play cost me 10 good men, half. $0.5 million in damage to my club, and $1 million in chemicals. Carried out the same operation before and nobody has survived. Well, they did, all of them. This will be carried out legally. Between the pressure of the media and the department, they're buried. - I've taken care of it. Oh, they'll be found guilty. Where were you doing the riot? What, am I supposed to believe that a jury will convict three LA police officers? Charges will be brought against them, and they'll be convicted. What about Caesar? Damn it. We hit Caesar's operation tomorrow. [gun shots] [music playing] [gun shots] [speaking spanish] CAESAR: Sooner or later they have to run out of bullets. [speaking spanish] MITCHELL: Where are they? No shows, all three of them this morning? All of them? All three missed their meetings? Every one of them, yes. What happened to the tales we had on them? Not enough men. They weren't scheduled until this morning. Where's Dante? I don't know, sir. I've been trying to reach him at home all morning. Soon as you hear from him, tell him I want to see him. You got it. Get me everything you have of those three. I want to eat, sleep, and breathe them till they're back here in this office, you understand? Yes, sir. I swear to God, I will track them down wherever they are. CAESAR: I apologize for bringing you down here like this, but let's face it, if I would have sent you an invitation, would you have come? I didn't think so. This is my village and my business. What business are you in? I import and export. Marijuana and cocaine. I am a man of my word. I am not a liar. And I consider a lying man a dog. I am in the drug trade, but my drug operation is also responsible for all the people in my village having jobs and being able to support their families. If taking out last the bombing rates. Excuse me, but how many people is it worth losing to keep your zero unemployment rate? We don't force people to take drugs. They create their own hell. You three have a serious problem in and so do I. What the hell do we have to do with you? We have a common enemy. I used to have a partner in the trade. Greed has a way of interfering with people's working relationships. This, um, guy, what does he got to do with us? CAESAR: Have either of you been associated with a name, Marshall Gumstock? Never heard of him. Sounds like a stockbroker. Or the name, um, Malcolm? Malcolm? Aw, yeah, Mr. Sloan. Never heard of him. This man, Malcolm owes me $1 million. You bring me the million dollar and him, you keep half, I keep half, Malcolm. I have never seen so much shit before. MITCHELL: Well, everything can tell you something. And the more information we have, the better chance we have of saving their lives. Saving their lives? You think it's their fault? When was the last time we were in the field? Well, I've never been in the field. I've just always been in the office. You know, when I was a kid, a police officer in the community got respect, believe it or not. We used to wave to the cop on the B. Today, we get laughter instead of the mornings, smart-assed replies and slurs, instead of sir. If I were on the street today with the street having more fire power than the department in many cases, I'm not so sure I wouldn't shoot first and ask questions later too. I don't think it's their fault. I think we let him down, the system. DANTE: With due respect, I think we're talking about three individuals here who don't value life, other people's or their own. These aren't police officers, they're cowboys. Where the hell have you been? Why don't you run a credit check on bill Sloan? Three eviction notices, an apartment full of drug paraphernalia, it's not a stretch to think that he'd be seduced by $100,000. I've been running a cross-check. Good. MITCHELL: Trying to get something new, but you didn't answer my question. DANTE: What's that? Where have you been? I had a dentist appointment. You know, by the look of their records, these guys have taken out some really strong people. Why did you pick Sloan, Cuff, and Weston for the job? Because at the time, I felt they were the best people for the job. That's not what Stark thought. DANTE: What the hell does Stark know? He knows his men. So why did you pick them? Solidarity. They were best friends. Why didn't you just look at the records? They're born shooters. That's what they are. I mean, it's obvious. You knew there was DEA on the inside. Are you suggesting that I'd sacrifice one of own? Did you? I'm not answering that question. - (YELLING) Did you? - Fuck you, no. [phone ringing] No. I'm telling you, it's not a good idea. He's offering us weapons, transportation, and $0.5 million. I don't like it. Oh, you don't like it? What do you know about this guy, Malcolm? He doesn't know anything. Don't fuck around. Who is he? I don't know anything. He said he doesn't know anything. Leave him alone. - OK, he knows, OK. I saw the look in your eye. (YELLING) I don't know anything. Call me fucking stupid, OK. Don't start this shit now Tommy. (YELLING) Billy, talk to me. You shouldn't be involved in this. But you're hiding something from me? Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm. (YELLING) Who the fuck is Malcolm. I had the drop. He moved. A man died in my arms. So he's dead, but he was connected the way you guys are connected with me. Malcolm wants one of us. We all go in, we all die. All right. We're all in this together. WESTON: So if we don't take Caesar's offer, what do you want to do? I don't know, escape. Way south to the beaches. Return to Mitchell and, uh, surrender. What you think counselor? No escape, no return. Grab the cash, grab Malcolm. New lives, huh, son. What is your decision? MITCHELL: Anything? Why the hell wasn't this on his record? Look at date. It happened two weeks ago and it wasn't filed until last night. Mr. Mitchell, What you find out, Johnson? Three suspects were taken down to Ceaser Sanchez's compound late last night. You know Marshall Gumstock. A.k.a. Malcolm, who doesn't? DEA has been after him for years, but we haven't been able to make anything stick. He's been feuding with Cesar Sanchez. I didn't know that. What the hell does that have to do with this investigation? Sloan killed Malcolm's brother. He probably doesn't even know that. JOHNSON: The word is Cesar has imported Cuff, Sloan, and Weston. He's seeking their employment. You know, if my feeling is right our shooters are headed on a direct course with Malcolm. Johnson, Stone, come on. I'll put out a warrant. MALCOLM: I assure you that Caesar Sanchez will soon pose no threat to your careers, so you have nothing to worry about. Thank you, Malcolm. And how are you this morning? Very good, thank you. There's a phone call for you in the study. It's great. When did he do all this renovation? Oh, I don't know. It's gorgeous. Beautiful. Yes? DANTE: Sloan, Cuff, and Weston are loose. MALCOLM: That doesn't make me very happy. I've also learned that they were contacted by Cesar. You, my friend, are on my death wish. You have made promises you have not kept, and you have put me in a very bad position. I'm sick and tired of your threats, Malcolm. I can't cover it anymore. I'm out. You'll be getting a visit from the FBI soon. The man's name is Mitchell, James Mitchell. Dante. Why did you do it? Money? Yes. Yes. For $1 million. Malcolm wanted the three kids and the DEA agent dead. I was there. There was no way they could come out of that place alive. I know with three against 12, I-- they pull off a miracle. Malcolm bet a million on a sure thing and lost. I gambled my career. [gun shots] MITCHELL: Detective Edward Dante, you're under arrest for the murders of officers Kevin Donaldson and Jack Silver. Kindly surrender your weapon. [music playing] [gun shot] [birds chirping] [music playing] [fighting] [music playing] [whistle] [fighting] [music playing] MALCOLM: Sloan, Cuff and Weston. [sigh] [music playing] [fighting] Matthew, Alex, come on talk to me. He can't talk right now, Malcolm. Aw, so the three little piggies decided to hunt down the big, bad wolf. Well, let the hunt begin. You know, I heard somewhere the more people a man kills, the more of himself he kills too. Well, Malcolm, you and I have killed a hell of a lot of people. And it all starts to add up to one day some low-life scum shoves a gun into an innocent girl's mouth and threatens to blow her brains out. Well, Malcolm, let me tell you, your brother was a pitiless, soulless piece of dog shit. Damn, he wasn't worth the piece of lead I spent on him. For some God damn reason, second I pulled that trigger, it suddenly hit me. I pulled it on myself too. Problem is my heart's still beating. MALCOLM: Well, don't worry Sloan, because I can fix that problem. I'll take care of your two partners too. Lord knows, they've been a pain in my ass for a long time. SLOAN: You know what your brother said to me with his dying breath? Hey, blue, tell Malcolm he's an asshole. (YELLING) You're a dead man, Sloan. [music playing] [gun shots] [fighting] What the hell's going on? You want me? You want some of this? Come on then, come on. Come and get me. Come on, Billy Sloan, come and get me. Come on. Go for it. [gun shots] [music playing] [police sirens] [music playing] [gun shots] [music playing] (YELLING) Hold your fire. Take cover and hold your fire. [music playing] There's something I thought they should know, sir. We found burned fragments of some material in the mountains yesterday, three separate bundles. Bundles? Has the lab checked the materials? Our preliminary is parachute. Thank you. So can I buy you a drink? Thanks, but I think I've got some things to take care of before I fly back to Washington. I'd like a rain check though. WESTON: Everything happened so fast, so fast as if it never happened. Fire burning, the smell of gasoline, the hot fire on our faces, the sound of attack. [music playing] All I want is to be free, but how free can I be when I'm in prison in my own freedom. [waves crashing] [music playing]
