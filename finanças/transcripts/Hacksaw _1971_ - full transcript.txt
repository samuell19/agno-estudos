If they hadn't, this whole story might not have happened. Now, this is my spread just outside of Calgary, Canada. I'm a chuck wagon man. Racing these wagons has been my whole life. My hands and arms are getting too old for this game but my heart and spirit'll be in chuck wagon racing just as long as I'll live. The only thing is that Tim Andrews will be holding the lines. Whoa. Tim, this is getting a little rough for me. How about you takin' over? You bet. You got 'em. (HORSES SNORTING) (CHUCKLES) Okay, take 'em away. Hyah! Now, that's a four-up racing team. I had the wagon and three good horses but I needed a leader. And that's where Hacksaw will come in. He's a near-side lead horse. The one that spells success or failure for the whole darn team. Hacksaw would still be running free if it hadn't been for this young flying cowboy named Tim Andrews. And even with all of Tim's horse-savvy, he needed help of a dude gal who just happened to be on a fishing vacation with her father. About how much longer before we get to your pack station? Oh, another half hour should put us in the camp, Mr. Curtis. That's great. You see those specks down there? Hang on. I'll give you the 50 cent tour. You better get your camera ready. (NEIGHS) I got it, I got it. What a shot. That's the most beautiful horse I've ever seen. You mean old Hacksaw? (CHUCKLES) I'll tell you about him, later. RANCHER: Tim's pack station is nestled by a remote lake deep in the back country. Fishing parties and supplies are flown in here and then with the help of Tim's Sarcee Indian partner, Cascade Joe, the guests are taken by pack outfit to hidden fishing streams in the wilderness country. Tim Andrews' roots were deeply planted in this land. He knew it both from the ground and from the air. Heya, Tim. Hello! Here you are. Oh, Cascade, this is Mr. Curtis and his daughter, Sue. (HORSES WHINNYING) SUE: Hey, before you get too comfortable, you said when we get into camp, you'd tell us about that beautiful wild stallion we saw this afternoon. That's right I did. Well, we call him old Hacksaw. He's a wild horse with the looks of a thoroughbred and the savvy of a mustang. Wouldn't it be great to catch him? Whoa up now, kitten. This is a fishing trip not a wild horse hunt. You better be thinking about tying some of this flies not lariats. (SIGHS) RANCHER: In the high country, breakfast is a meal that's gotta stick to your rib. And Leona, the camp cook figured out just how many miles you had to go that day and then come up with the right combinations. TIM: All set? CASCADE: All set. Let's go get some trout. (NEIGHS) This country was Tim's backyard. But a certain brown stallion called Hacksaw considered it his country too. And he kept a distant watch on all intruders. Now, hold up here and check the pack on this brown horse. How you doin', Mr. Curtis? Fine. Should be surprised how much exercise you get just sitting in the saddle. You sure don't look like what I expected of a north woods guide. Oh. What did you expect? I had you pictured as this grizzled old man with whiskers and patched up old clothes that smell like wet campfire. But you're not like that. Disappointed? No. But you don't fit the picture I already had in my mind. How did you get in this business? I just grew up in it, I guess. Huntin', fishin', punchin' cows. Breakin' horses in rodeos my whole life. I did a hitch in the RCAF and I learned to fly and I liked it. So I just figured I'd put all those things together and try to make a living at it. You're all set? Anytime, Tim. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Aha! Now I got you, baby. Come on. MR. CURTIS: Oh. Ah. Now I got you, baby. RANCHER: Now maybe there's no such thing as love at first sight with horses but, whatever it was Hacksaw sure was interested when he scented the presence of the beautiful golden Twinkletoes. (WHINNIES) (SNORTING) Ahh! Looks like our Susie's been fishing a little too deep today. I believe I'd switch to a dry fly tomorrow. I'll tell ya one thing about her, she really tries. You know, most people try to reel the trout into them, not her. She goes right in after 'em. (NEIGHS) (SNORTING) (WHINNIES) (HORSE WHINNYING) Just about anybody can outsmart a dumb old fish. And today was your day, dad. But never underestimate the power of a woman. Tim, I got this great idea, but I need your help. Tim? Hm? Here you go. Dad, you wouldn't mind fishing alone tomorrow would ya? Great with me, kitten. All you do is scare the fish, anyway. Salt and pepper, please, Tim. Hey, Tim. Sure, here you go. Tim, would you listen? I got this great idea. Sure what? Come over here. I'll tell you about it. This is the place. All right, now, I'll hobble Twinkletoes while you go and hide your horse, somewhere out of sight. Right, chief. RANCHER: It took a little doing but Sue halfway convinced him to try her plan and it was, uh, sort of a female logic idea. Now, you stay here. Now what? Oh, Tim could you help me take the saddle off? This looks like the perfect spot. It sure does. TIM: Let's get started. Well, for an outdoorsman and a guide that's sure not much of a trap. Tim, that wouldn't fool anything. You know, most of our Canadian wild horses haven't spent four years at Vassar. Now, look I've shown a little faith in your idea. Have a little faith in mine. You wait here while I stash your saddle with my stuff. (SUE SCREAMING) (GROANING) (CHUCKLES) (GROANING) (CHUCKLING) And now that you, uh, now that you know how it works, what do you think? Well it feels like a good trap. (CHUCKLING) Let me down. Hang on. (GASPS) (SNORTS) This is it. Up here he can't hear us or see us or catch our scent. We've got a grandstand view. You know, a watched pot never boils so let's just relax and get comfortable, hm? (EXHALES) (DEEP BREATHING) (TWIG SNAPPING) Tim... What? I think I hear something. (TREES RUSTLING) It's Hacksaw. It's going to work. Shhh. (WHISPERING) Take it easy. Don't spook him off. (ROARS) Let's get closer. (BEAR GROWLING) Are you crazy? (ROARS) (GROWLING) (WHINNIES) (GROWLING) (WHINNIES) (TWINKLETOES WHINNIES) Oh, no. There goes Twinkletoes. (SNORTING) Tim. Tim, I'm sorry. Really sorry. It all seemed so easy. Now, I've lost Twinkletoes for you. Don't worry about that old Palomino mare. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Hey, cheer up. (TIM CHUCKLES MILDLY) Hey, how am I gonna get out of here? Don't worry about it. A good guide is obligated to furnish suitable transportation. (GRUNTING) Dad. I'd like to stay over and help Tim find Hacksaw and Twinkletoes. Well, kitten, we sure had a lot of fun and it's been exciting but I've got to get back to New York on business. I just can't wait over. However that doesn't necessarily mean that you have to come with me. You're a big girl now. Kinda think you can take care of yourself. Would maybe, uh, another week do it? (CHUCKLES) RANCHER: A week might seem like a long time but not when you spread it out over a country as big as this is. Tim covered all the open spots by air but now maybe these horses had sought out a more secluded area. We aren't having much luck, you can't see anything through those trees. The only way you cover this area is on horseback. RANCHER: The search was continued on the ground. The three fanned out to look for tracks. The next day they separated to cover even more territory. Cascade was an experienced tracker. If there are any signs, he'd find them. He looked for meadows with good feed. But only the elk were here. The search went on for the better part of a week. Up, down and across. And when the wearied three finally converged, Tim called it quits. Let's get back before it gets dark. Twinkletoes and her abductor seemed to have been swallowed up by the Rockies. ♪ I ride an old Paint and I lead an old Dan ♪ I'm off to Montana for to throw the hoolihan ♪ Gonna feed in the coulees and water in the draw ♪ Their tails are all ma... ♪ TIM: Don't move.

It was evident, he'd been caught before. Once that rope was on him, he acted like a broke horse. Plum gentle. (WHINNIES) Well, we got us a horse. Cascade, what do you say, we tie up those mules, huh? Yes. He's already shown us he doesn't think much of our corrals and fences. Maybe we ought to put him in the barn for the night. Might be lonely. It's his first night in captivity. Can't we leave Twinkletoes in the corral near him? I'll toss him a flake of hay. His problems will seem a lot smaller on a full stomach. (SNORTING) (WHINNIES) Hey, we got company. Howdy, Tim. Dusty. (SNORTING) (SNORTING) Mighty neighborly of you to round up my stock for me. I've been looking for him off and on for months now. TIM: Well, I'm glad to help. I know those mules of yours but I don't figure this stud belongs to anybody. He's not carrying any brand. He's been running loose in this country for years. Why Tim, I've rode that old horse a lot of times. I've hunted off of him and moved cattle with him. Well anybody can tell he belongs in my string. TIM: I'll tell you what we'll do, Dusty. You just saddle him and get on him right here in this corral. You can ride him out that gate, he's yours. Why thank you, Tim. You know, I think I'll just do that. (CHUCKLES) Over here, Cascade. (SNORTING) Whoa, whoa, whoa. RANCHER: There's a breed of man in this country called cowboy. To him there ain't a horse that can't be rode. There's also a breed of horse called bronc and to him there ain't a man that can't be throwed. Every once in a while these two come together and that time was now. (WHINNIES) (BRAYING) (HACKSAW SNORTING) (GROANING) (SNORTING) Well, looks like the ownership of Hacksaw is pretty well established. That's my horse. Our horse. Can't let him get away with that. Gotta show him who's boss. Hello, buddy. You're not gonna ride him after that are you? Well, I hope so. You're crazy. RANCHER: So you gotta show 'em who's boss. That was okay with Hacksaw just as long as you kept off his back while showin' him. Tim figured he was a better bronc rider than Dusty was. Might even be a little tougher too. This was gonna be a good time to prove it. Right in front of Sue. CASCADE: You got 'em. Whoa! C'mon, Tim! CASCADE: Stay with him, Tim. That's it! (GRUNTING) Oh. RANCHER: He was a better bronc rider than Dusty all right. About eight seconds better. You shouldn't have let him get away with that. Are you going to show him who's boss again? Well, we got ourselves a horse. Even if I can't ride him. Are you okay? Yeah. RANCHER: Cascade allowed a day for Tim's hide and feelings to heal. Then he thought he might as well show him how to get the job done. Well, he can sure fool ya. He acts plum gentle. Oh. Dusty and Tim just weren't clever enough to figure out Hacksaw. Joe had time to study their mistakes. So, now he felt he had the right combinations necessary to stay on top of this tough stud. Easy boy. The Sarcee Indians were noted for their skill aboard this kind of dynamite. Easy boy. Joe hated to show Tim up but certain pride inside him said it was no time to stop now. Okay, Tim. Let me have him. When you got on Hacksaw's back he felt the same way too. (HORSE NEIGHING) Stay in the buggy! Atta boy! Hang on! Hacksaw now scored a lead. Three down and so far none to go. Well, he's had his chance to be a saddle horse. If he won't ride, he'll pack. Oh, no. Well, everyone's gotta work for a living in this outfit. Not that. Not to a beautiful horse like him. It would break his heart. But his breaking is a long way from his heart. C'mon Tim, I'll give you a hand. This Hacksaw, he was really a fooler. He accepted the pack saddle with its cinches, breast collar and breeching. Even the rattle of the portable kitchen didn't bother him. He actually never resented man. Just as long as he stayed off his back. But pack trips aren't taken in corrals, so Tim gave him the final test, out in the open. Tim didn't have to teach Hacksaw anything about handling his footing in rough country. But he did need a few lessons in basic packhorse manners. Oop. You don't put the trees between us, Hack. You follow me. What's wrong? What happened to Hacksaw's shoulder? Oh, nothing much. He decided to take a shortcut between two trees that weren't quite far enough apart. Well, you always have to scratch off a little bark to make a good packhorse. You dumb cowboys are all alike. You have to bend and break and boss with brute strength. You never consider doing anything a woman's way. Kindness, and gentleness, and patience, and understanding. Would you be nice if I got on your back? RANCHER: So, now it was ladies' day in Tim's corral. Maybe Sue had something that cowboys don't know about. It ain't gonna take long to find out. Tim? See, he doesn't mind my being on his back at all. You're not going to believe this but Hacksaw said it'd be all right. Kindness is a universal language understood by all animals, and most people. Oh! (NEIGHING) Ah. Tim, that horse lied to me. He lied! I agree with you fellas. He'll make a beautiful packhorse. RANCHER: Sue had left Tim's world of mountains and forests and returned to her home in the east. Winter crept in early this year. The snows blanketed the higher mountains. The fall air suddenly became crisp. Nature was putting her range land into cold storage. This was the signal for the elk herds to migrate to the lower valleys. It was time to haul firewood. Everybody had to work. Even Hacksaw. That oughta be enough for the first load. I'll take this back to camp. Okay, see you later. (MOTOR STARTING) That didn't take very long. Here we are back for another load. CASCADE: Well, you sure don't need that kind of speed for wood haulin'. (BOTH LAUGHING) RANCHER: And winter did arrive. In full force. Hi, Leona. Hi, Joe. Hi, Tim. How 'bout some hot soup for a couple of frozen cowboys? There's some on the other stove. It'll be ready in a minute. T-R-Nine, T-R-Nine. This is Seven-Five-X-ray. Come in T-R-Nine. Seven-Five-X-ray to T-R-Nine. I read you now T-R-Nine. Charlie? Tim, I just got in. What's up? Tim, we have a plane down at coordinates 0-5-1-8-5-7. Impossible to get into by air. Can't contact the pilot. Can you effect a ground rescue? Yeah, I know that area. You know, it's pretty rough area to get into this time of the year. We'll give it a try. I'll be on my way in about, oh, 15 minutes. Thanks Tim. Seven-Five-X-ray out. Want me to go in with you, Tim? No, I think it's better you stay here with the radio. I'll pack my stuff. You saddle my horse. Oh, uh... Put that rescue gear on... On Hacksaw. Okay. RANCHER: A horse that has run loose in this kind of country and survived a few of its winters has a lot of savvy. And Tim was counting on this as well as his stamina and heart. Hacksaw was now a gambler's choice. Tim's horse helped to break trail for Hacksaw but the grueling pull was tiring him. Every step seemed like 50. As the snow became deeper, Tim's horse weakened. He could no longer break trail. Without Tim's weight he could make it back down a trail by himself. Now it was just Tim and Hacksaw. T-R-9. This is Snowbird. T-R-9. This is Snowbird. Do you read me? T-X-9 here. Go ahead, Snowbird. We found him. He's alive but in bad shape. I think you better get a doctor and a rescue vehicle. We'll meet you at Goose Creek. 10-4 Snowbird. We'll be heading back in a few minutes. Snowbird clear. RANCHER: Tim knew a shortcut to Goose Creek and it would save valuable hours. If they could get to the crest and Hacksaw had enough strength left then maybe his plan would work and the wounded man would have a chance. Well, this is where he said he'd meet us, Jim, but there's no sign of him yet. Just lots and lots of snow. Why don't we wait inside and keep warm? (PANTING) RANCHER: Hacksaw's short wait at the top of the crest gave him a breather. He was gonna need it. Hold on a little longer, fella. It won't be long now. Whoa. You all right, Tim? Yeah, and I'll tell you something, This is a pretty good horse. RANCHER: In the Canadian northwest, winter had many faces. One day she could bring tragedy and suspense, the next a tranquil beauty. During these months, Tim Andrews worked for the provincial government's fish and game department. His duties were many but most important, he checked the migration of game herds. Made rough counts on 'em. Even checked the predators who followed. With winter's changing mood there came a time for fun. Nothing in this country stopped as long as you could do it on skis. (MARCHING BAND PLAYING) (DOGS BARKING) There was all kinds of competition but the kids with the toughest hides liked skijoring best. But Tim came here for one special reason. The cutter races. He figured Hacksaw was up to a new test and they might as well have some sport trying. There was another feller here for the same reason. Tim's old friend, Dusty Trent. Who hadn't been beaten in sled racing for years. (SCREAMING) Tim had invited Sue out for the festivities and a chance to see Hacksaw in action. It didn't take too much coaxing to get her on a plane either. I guess she kind of felt like she had a stake in Hacksaw's career too. Gee, it was great to get your wire, Tim. Well, I'm glad you could make it. So, have you had breakfast? Uh-uh. Well, come on then, let's go. Thanks for the breakfast, Tim. For a little girl, you sure eat a lot. I'm dying to see Hacksaw. Why don't you go on over to your motel and change? Meet me in the field by the rodeo grounds. Watch us warm up. How's he working, Tim? You'll see. Hey, Tim, wait for me. (SNOWMOBILE BACKFIRING) Whoa! Steady, steady! Hi. What the heck's the matter with you? What? Can't ya turn that darn thing off? I can't hear... What? I said, can't you turn... Never mind, never mind. Check your speedometer to see how fast we're going. Oh, no! (SCREAMING) Whoa! Whoa. TIM: Are you all right? Next time you want me to clock your racehorse, get me a stopwatch! (TIM LAUGHING) You brat. ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Big Winter Carnival. Relax, keep warm and have a good time. Cutter racing is a big winter sport and in many parts of the west. Kinda helps to shorten up the long winters. There's a lot of jackpot racing, where the boys run for their own money and a few towns like ours who put up some big purses to get the good ones in. These events get pretty hot and heavy so please stand back, relax and have a good time. (STARTING BELL RINGING) (JOCKEYS YELLING) RANCHER: Cutter races are mostly run in pairs. But the big championship race this year would be for singles. I'm always on the lookout for good horses so I never miss these cutter races. It's a good thing because this is when I first spotted Tim Andrews and Hacksaw. Now, don't worry about me. Just get Hacksaw ready. See you after the races. Good luck. (STARTING BELL RINGING) (JOCKEYS YELLING) (CROWD CLAPPING AND CHEERING) You boys all set? Whoa. Why, look who's here. TIM: Hello, Dusty. And he's got ol' Hacksaw with him. I thought we'd give you a little run for your money. I reckon a little competition might do me some good. That's just what you're gonna get. (LAUGHING) Yeah, you do that. (PROMPTING HORSE) (JOCKEYS YELLING) (CROWD CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: And now for our big special event. The one we've all been waiting for. The single horse cutter race. Our top local boy, Chuck Daniels driving Antelope Annie. Chuck will be driving against two boys from up north. Dusty Trent, a top driver driving Alberta Lad. Dusty always shows up with a fast horse and you can bet he won't be afoot today either. Our third driver is Tim Andrews. A newcomer to our cutter races. Driving a horse called Hacksaw. RANCHER: I couldn't keep my eyes off that big stallion. He had a breedy look about him that you just don't see too often around these parts. And I wondered if he could run. Go! (CROWD CHEERING) C'mon, Hacksaw! Move over, get outta my way! TIM: Move over! C'mon, Hacksaw! (CROWD CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: The winner is Dusty Trent and Alberta Lad. RANCHER: That judge must have been blind not to see why Hacksaw got beat. And I'd seen enough to know I was interested in that horse. SUE: Tim. Can't win 'em all. Hey, Pete, toss a blanket over him, will ya? Hacksaw, you sure tried. No apologies. We'll just have to learn to outsmart that kind of competition. CASCADE: Say, Tim. Feller here wants to talk to ya. Excuse me, Sue. I'll be right back. Don't worry Hacksaw. Tim, you remember Mr. Farrell. Oh, sure. How're you doing? Good to see you again, Tim. Excuse me. Surely. That was a great race out there. And I saw what really happened. Huh, you run into all kinds of people in the horse business. Yeah, but I was watching you and that stallion and I think you're just what I've been looking for. Now, I'm talking about chuck wagon racing. Me and ol' Hacksaw? Yeah. Well, he wouldn't know what it's all about and neither would I. Besides, I've never driven a four-up. But we can fix all that. I've been in lots of chuck wagon races for lots of years. Part of my trouble, too many years. But I still got a good rig and three good horses. And all I need to win is a good lead horse that's fast and fearless and tough. And you got a horse like that. Yeah. The other thing I need is youth and you got that too. But chuck wagon racing is big time and there's lots of money in it. So, if you and Hacksaw wanna throw in with me, I think we can come up with a pretty big bundle of that money. Now, you think it over and when the weather clears you and Hacksaw come down to my place and we'll give it a try. Sounds interesting, Mr. Farrell. I'll um... I'll think about it. Fair enough. Okay. Well, thanks for coming, Sue. When you say hello to your dad, tell him the fishing will be great this spring. Goodbye, Tim. And take good care of Hacksaw. RANCHER: The warm Chinook winds finally arrived and winter lost her hold. The icicles made a last attempt to hang on but the spring air put 'em outta business. Seems like about this time everything in the woods came alive. (ROARING MILDLY) When the grass came up and the ground was good for gallopin' Tim and Cascade hauled Hacksaw down to my place for trainin'. Tim, there's one other thing you're gonna need and that's an outrider. Now, he don't have to be too smart but he's got to be able to ride like a wild Indian and toss that cookin' stove in that tailgate basket. Sort of like basketball, huh? Only with a... With a moving basket and a square iron ball. Yeah, you got it. Well, let's give it a try. I believe you boys are ready for lesson number two. Get up here. Come on now, Hacksaw. RANCHER: Hacksaw's training had taught him to lean into collar but there's a lot more to being a lead horse than just running and pulling. He's got to maneuver. Speed without control never won a chuck wagon race. Standing quiet for a fast start was most important. This gives the outrider time to fire that stove into raft. He's also got to cross that finish line behind his team. This year's special race at the Calgary Stampede would start on the track and then go cross-country. This called for some special trainin' for both Tim and Hacksaw. Fast turns on grass. This was the secret. Now a good driver talks to his horses right through these lines. You got to have the hands for it. You need strength with sensitivity. Everything a driver asks for is telegraphed right through these lines. This year, there would be different obstacles. Water would be one of them. The race starts with cutting a figure-eight around the barrels. Hacksaw had to lead his team around these barrels. Knocked-over barrels mean penalties. And too many penalties can cost you the race. Starting, pulling, running, turning and speed are all important. But the most important thing was for your horses to be fit. This trainin' was for the big race and they had to go a grueling distance. It was going to be the toughest race in stampede history. Tim. Joe. You boys have learned everything that I can teach you. I think we're ready for it. So Tim, why don't you take the whole shebang up to your place and practice just every chance you get? 'Cause that big, special stakes race is comin' up in July, and I fully expect to meet you there in the winners' circle. You heard that, didn't you? RANCHER: Tim's pack station was now headquarters for his racing team. Okay, Cascade, turn him loose. Okay. RANCHER: The training of Hacksaw and company never let down. Tim took my advice and got in his road work. Slow miles, but important miles. Now the team was handling as one unit. The wheelers kept the slack out of the traces, and the leaders were given enough head so they'd move out free and easy. In any form of competition, there's always a scout for an opposing team. Dusty Trent was that guy. As a top racing driver himself, he kept a close watch on his competitors. TIM: Whoa! Howdy? Albert, you got my stuff ready? You bet! That looks like a pretty fair outfit. I wonder what kind of a driver he really is. What do you say, we try him, Earl? Good idea. Just hand me that rifle.

(BIRDS CHIRPING) DUSTY: Hello there! Anybody home? Hey, Tim! Go. (GRUNTING) Is anybody home? Hey, Tim! STRANGER: Hey, Dusty. Are you sure this all right with your friend? Well, sure, it's all right.

RANCHER: It didn't take Tim and Cascade long to figure out what happened. Telltale marks of an intruder are always a lot more obvious in the back country. Hoof prints pounded into the dirt. Sorrel horse hairs on a broken rail. These all told a story. You don't have to be an expert to know what went on here. RANCHER: It was easy for Tim to follow the trail at first but it got tougher with time and distance. And time was running out. The big chuck wagon race of Calgary was coming up and we didn't have a lead horse. Cascade and Tim checked all the shaded areas. Even better at findin' animals in distress are the ravens. Tim and Cascade studied their flight patterns. (RAVENS CAWING) When animals are wounded or sick their natural instinct is to hole up somewhere. Now, Hacksaw was badly hurt. He might be down. If he'd lost blood and was weak, he'd stay hidden. As the search wore on, the race seemed less important. Tim admitted to himself that he'd just settle for getting Hacksaw back. (CLANGING) Over here. What's the matter? Aren't you feeling good? You haven't finished off your grain. Huh. RANCHER: Hacksaw had survived in the wilds before and understood the human ways of nature. To him, survival meant good grass, clean air and cold water. When Hacksaw's bruised body stopped achin' he came out in the open. This big country was his home. He knew all its streams and grasslands. All the havens where a horse could live in peace. But the better he felt, the more restless he became. He had a new home now and new ties. He had an urgency to return. (NEIGHING) (NEIGHING) (GRUNTING) (NEIGHING) Hacksaw, you old lop-eared rascal. (SNORTING) He showed up in the nick of time. Calgary, here we come. (WHOOPING) RANCHER: Calgary is billed as the greatest outdoor show on Earth. And I really believe it is. The preliminary chuck wagon races touch off a spark that blasts the whole show off to an exciting pitch. Practically everybody in the Dominion of Canada gets stampede fever. People come from all over the world to join in the excitement. Sue and her father felt they had a stake in the big race too. And it didn't take long for them to catch the fever. Chuck wagon racin' was the big event here. But the stampede has a championship rodeo, parades, livestock shows, carnival on the midway and a week of Indian pow-wow with tribes from all over Western Canada. Wayne, take the horses on the other side. I'll be right there. SUE: Hey, Tim! Hey, Sue! Mr. Curtis, welcome to Calgary. Nice to be back, Tim. Had a nice trip? Wonderful. Sure did. Good. Hi, Cascade. Hi! It's good to see you again. You're lookin' good. Are you sure Hacksaw's ready for this race? Is he all right? Well, he's tough. He's plenty tough. We just won't know how tough until he gets in that race. That's right. You know, we all have a personal interest in this horse. We wouldn't miss this for the world. Excuse me, folks. I'm gonna harness up. RANCHER: Chuck wagon racing has its own rules and regulations. All competing wagons have to weigh in at not less than 1,325 pounds. All rigs have to have standard running gear. There are even regulations for width and height. The association has official judges to pass on all entries. Here, Bill. Hold this while I grease it up. When I pick up the wagon, you put the wheel on. You really think you can lift that? Lift it? I just might turn it over. RANCHER: With all the preliminary races over, time was drawing near for the big race and this is what we came for. ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, The Westernaires. (HOOVES GALLOPING) (APPLAUDING) (NEIGHING) (CROWD APPLAUDING) And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the event you've been waiting for. The finals of the chuck wagon races. This year it's different. It's the big, special race of the stampede with the wagons using only one outrider. And for the first time, the wagons will leave the arena, race pell-mell over cross-country and then return to the arena track, for the wild and exciting finish. Okay, here they come on the track for the start. Moving up into their barrel positions, Norm Dutton has drawn barrel number one. At barrel number two, it's Don Weldon. There's Dusty Trent moving into number three barrel position. And Tim Andrews is at the number four barrel spot. (CROWD CHATTERING) ANNOUNCER: And there they go! (ANNOUNCER CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) Whoa, steady! (CROWD GASPS) Oh, Dad. Cascade's hurt! He'll be all right. ANNOUNCER: He's been hurt and he's making his mount back up again. (RIDERS YELLING) (ALL CHEERING) Norm Dutton is going behind for number three and Tim Andrews is ridin' behind at number four, as they head into that first turn. Ha! (CROWD CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: Cascade Joe is comin' up and has now regained his outrider's position as Tim Andrews takes a slight lead. Ha! (ALL CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: The pace is terrific. They are heading out the back gate for the outside course. Phil Crystal will call it from the judges' stand in the field. Take it away, Phil. Thank you, Joe. And that field well bunched is really pounding. Those four teams and four top drivers are pouring it on, as they head over the crest and on to the course. (RIDER YELLING) (CROWD CHEERING) (HORSES NEIGHING) (LAUGHING) (DUSTY YELLING) (RIDERS URGING) Yah! Yah! Yah! Hyah! (URGING) And now we'll separate the men from the boys out there as they sweep across Desperation Flat, heading for Cudney Swamp. (CRASHING) (HORSES NEIGHING) (CROWD SCREAMING) (CROWD GASPS) (MOCKING LAUGHTER) PHIL: Dutton's around in front, okay. Andrews makes a run! And Trent with plenty of ground to make up. (CROWD CHEERING) (DUSTY URGING) PHIL: They're flying! Around that final bound, folks! And now, back to you, Joe Carbury. JOE: And here they come back, into the entrance skate of the arena track for the final push. It's Dutton and Trent, neck and neck, Tim Andrews third by two lengths with Weldon disqualified. Dusty Trent is leading and Norm Dutton is running second, and Tim Andrews can't get through. He's blocked out. He's having trouble in that back stretch. (RIDERS URGING) Hyah! Yah! (URGING) (BANGING) (SCREECHING) JOE: Now, Tim Andrews tries to pull through that opening. Come on, Hacksaw! JOE: His lead horse is fighting to get in there. (URGING) Sure you win that one! JOE: Andrews is going to make it. He's going to get there! (RIDERS URGING) JOE: It looks as though Tim Andrews is starting to move on in front. Is Tim Andrews gonna get there? He is! He gets there in time! (CROWD CHEERING) Oh, he did it! JOE: Ladies and gentlemen, it's official. Tim Andrews is the winner. And now, Mr. Ed O'Connor, President of the Stampede, will present the championship trophy. Congratulations, Tim! Good race. Really good race! Thank you, sir. Thank you. Real good race. How are you? Good. It was a great race, Tim! I told you I'd get you in the winners' circle. Got a little tight there for a minute. Yeah. (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING) Cascade, that doc's waitin' for you. You better get on over to see him. I'll catch up with you in a minute. Oh, okay. Congratulations, Tim! Well, thanks, Jimmy! You know, you walk almost as reckless as you drive. First of all, you try to run me off that racetrack. And now you're tryin' to crowd me plum out of this rodeo ground. Dusty, I never tried to crowd you. I tried to stay out of your way, but you just don't understand, do you? Oh, yeah, I understand. (GRUNTS IN PAIN) (HORSE NEIGHING) (NEIGHING) SUE: Tim! Joe! Quick! TIM: Oh, no. Not another blonde around here. (GRUNTING) (NEIGHING) Joe. What happened? It's my trophy from the big race. (FOAL NEIGHING) Sue, why don't you hop on my horse? We'll take a little ride to the other side of the lake, okay? Okay. Figured ol' Hacksaw's gotta be dog-tired after that chuck wagon race. (CHUCKLES) RANCHER: Yes, Tim was that rare breed of cowboy to never accept defeat. He had the edge on Hacksaw now. He'd show him he could get on his back and stay there. Look, he's gentle as a kitten! (NEIGHS WILDLY) (NEIGHING WILDLY) (GRUNTS) (NEIGHING) Oh, no. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Well, you showed him who's boss again. You shouldn't let him do that, Tim. Can't we just do it his way from now on? Uh, I give up. He's still the best horse I've ever owned. You mean, he's the best horse we've ever owned. ♪ And if I stay a while ♪ We can run and play a while ♪ Don't you think you and I should have a happy ending ♪
