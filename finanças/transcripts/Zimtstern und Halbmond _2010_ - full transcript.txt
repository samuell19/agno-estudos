Cinnamon Star and Crescent Moon The worst day in your life is when they hand you a certificate. It says 'Exemplary performance, well-deserved retirement'. Bullshit! You're old news. All of a sudden. My first day on board. That was almost 30 years ago. Best day of my life. What do you do in the years you have left? The water was my home, and now? Those freshwater sailors still had it all ahead of them. And me? A life sentence of solid ground under my fins. I didn't always want to go to Bavaria. No. But Lisbeth would have died in Hamburg. Like a fish in dry dock. Someone had to compromise back then. We had a good marriage. Lisbeth was always my harbor, my anchor, my evening star. On land, my wife was always the captain. But a little below land, I had built my bunker. Lisbeth and I were very different. Maybe that's why our marriage worked. I let her have the church choir, she let me have the Frisian bar. And we had the best daughter in the world. Gottfried? Barbara will be here soon. Please get the Christmas tree. And bring vanilla sugar. The cinnamon stars must be ready before my choir rehearsal. - What's that? - A retirement present. From my successor. Bathtub captain. - Not in front of the nativity! - Why not? Change is good. - Three kings in a steamer? - The Roman fleet was modern. But the Three Kings were Negroes. Blacks, Lisbeth! Blacks! Oh? But at home you are not in charge! - Hold this. - No, I'll get it! - I'll do it. - No, I'll get it! - Hello, Barbara! - Barbara! Come in, sweetheart. - Watch out! You're not so young anymore. - I almost forgot today. I'm glad you're here. Let's see your captain's license. License to fly in Europe. But now you're here. To bake cinnamon stars. Here. 17 for the Menzingers. Every year. Tell me. My Barbara. She flies farther in one week than I have sailed in my whole life. And the best was: after all that, she was stationed in Munich. I wasn't the only woman... Barbara, drop that! - I'll show you the attic. - The attic? The bathroom works perfectly. But the kitchen isn't quite ready yet. And if you want... ...I can build you an outside staircase. I've got time. That's... You're crazy. That's... That must cost... Nonsense! We help each other. It'll be all right. I, uh... I can take an apartment in Munich. What? At those rental prices! You can live here, as agreed. You pay back your education loan! Did you meet someone? Yes. Something serious? Yes! He's wonderful, Mom. The best man in the world! Oh? Nice. Does he have a good job? - He's a "service professional". - A ticket stamper! - Ground steward. He is very good. - Aren't there any pilots there? - He wants to be a pilot. - Why isn't he? - It's a long story. - How long has this story been writing? - And? Do you want to get married? - Why not. Nice that we got to meet him! - I've only known him for 3 months. - Oh, that long! It was funny how we met... Barbara! You are too young to understand what marriage means. You are too old to understand what love means! She's your daughter, not a sailor. The world is open to her. An international career. Her education was expensive. Maybe she wants a family. With a ticket stamper? How will he support her? Go to her and apologize! Because... It's Christmas. Barbara! Dad? Oh, there you are! We just want you to be happy. I am happy. Girl, you've achieved so much. Marriage means to give up a lot. You were always bitching about my friends. Not one was good enough. And I was right, you dumped them! This time it's different. You'll see. You have to meet him. Cookie? You must meet him! - Do I have to? - I've already invited him. For Christmas. I work here. Unaccompanied minor! Come on, Linus! Put your bag on here! And this! Turn around, please! - Is that your girlfriend? - Yes. She's flying you to Bremen. - Do you make out? - Do you have a girlfriend? Come here! - Is this your bag? - His. The child travels alone. - Who packed the bag? - Mom, why? Plastic. Maybe a replica. Security check. This is forbidden on the plane. - Your badge! - Who? Me? Linus, wait! - Give it to me! - The man's got a gun! - No. It's just a kid. - The Arab's in disguise! - Drop the gun! - What gun? Are you crazy? He's an employee. - Islamists, fascistoids! - Fascistoid yourself! Evacuation, delay charges. - She called me "fascistoid"! - Insulting passengers! He called him "fascistoid"! - She's lying! - You're lying! Mrs. Hinrichs! What you did in your probationary period... I did it! I called him a fascist-thing. - He can't even pronounce it. - That's OK. - I said it... - She thought it, I said it. Let the woman speak! We are not in your home, women have rights here! - That's racist. - Don't insult me! - You are his accomplice. - That's what I said. A "sleeper"! - Sleeper! - Fascist! There! He can say it. Mr. Abu Khalil, even your kind don't insult the boss... I know. I quit! Ground staff was shit anyway! - And your official residence? - Gone. - How long can you stay? - Without work? 3 months. You want to try for pilot in Dubai again? - I don't want to hold you back. - Too bad! - What if I come with you? - You have the best job in the world. Then apply again here in Germany! You passed all the tests! They'd rather allow blind drunks into the cockpit than Arabs. - But with a German passport. - I'm not getting married for a passport. Don't worry. I'll find work. And I'll pass a private flying school. Listen! About the apartment... - You can stay with me. - I'll sleep at Yusuf's. There's a separate flat. Do your parents know where I'm from? It's not an issue. They're very tolerant. Don't worry about it. ♪ "Who is knocking?" ♪ ♪ "Only two very poor people." ♪ ♪ "What do you want?" ♪ ♪ "Give us shelter today!" ♪ "Oh, for the love of God we pray:" ♪ "Open your shelters to us!" ♪ ♪ "Oh, no, no, no!" ♪ ♪ "Oh let us in!" ♪ ♪ "It cannot be." ♪ ♪ "We would be thankful." ♪ ♪ "No. It really cannot be." ♪ ♪ "Go away now! ♪ ♪ You can't get in." ♪ Jesus, Lisbeth!

Kamal -- My father. Merry Christmas! Oh! Wait! Uh... Yes. Merry Christmas! - Yeah, Merry Christmas! - Mom! - Mom! This is Kamal... - Kamal -- My mother. Yes... - Yes, Mr... - Kamal. Yes. Welcome, Mr. Camel! - Yes... - Come in, come in! - Why didn't you tell us? - Tell you what? - Where is he from? - From Bethlehem. - Don't talk nonsense! - He is Palestinian. Ah! Palestinian! Aha! - Merry Christmas. - Yes. Merry Christmas! All this is not quite ready yet. But make yourself at home! Uh... Do you drink wine? Uh... Yes, please. Thank you. Red? White? White. So you come from Bethlehem. Yes. On my camel. I always wanted to go to Israel. Right, Gottfried? But... Well! Bethlehem is an Arab town. - "Bait Lahm." - Ah! - Do you celebrate Christmas? - Of course! Arabs love festivals. You must fly there sometime! Yes, but... that means... you're not... Palestinian. I am! But I thought... Palestinians, they are Muslims. And... they are... against the Jews and against the Christians. We Palestinians are Christians and Muslims. It's the Holy Land! We celebrate all festivals. We bring gifts at Christmas and during Ramadan. - No kidding! - Yes... and... And you are now... what? I'm a Muslim. He's a Muslim. We also believe in Jesus. His name is Aisa. Mary is called Maryam. Joseph is Yusuf. In Bethlehem there are signs: "Here was the manger" "Here an angel appeared" We also have a lot of donkeys. Especially the politicians! Well... My daughter tells me you want to be a pilot. Yes. Ever since I was little. I always wanted to fly. In the Palestinian Air Force? - There is no such thing. - I meant the airline. - There isn't one either. - That's why he's in Germany. And where are you flying now? Right now I am... "between jobs". The job market situation in Germany is tight. These days. And the Middle East policy... uh... Excuse me! Lisbeth! In the kitchen ... - The ... You know. - Yes. Say it already! He's a Muslim. A Palestinian who wants to fly a plane. What do you mean? Think about it! He can have at least four wives? Yes, that too. - Can I help you? - No. Uh... I just have to put the carp in the oven. And I have to get changed. Since when are you against foreigners? I'm a liberal! We already have one fundamentalist. I don't need another one! One more thing! Kamal is moving in with me. No, no. That's just an idea of Barbara's. So you can get to know each other! Yes... Yes. That's ... Uh ... Right, Gottfried? No, no. I really don't want... No, no, no. It's okay. Barbara! Come here, will you? Dad? You're acting a little strange. No, no, there's plenty of room under my roof. He can learn our customs and traditions. And we don't need to go on vacation to see foreign culture: Mosques, veiled women: right here at our doorstep! - Maybe even an honor killing... - Dad! Kamal! Wait! Please! - He's usually different. - Yes. I'm different too. A monster! - Stay here! Stay! - No! Don't leave! Please! Kamal...! Shit! - Be reasonable! - Please, not on Christmas Eve! Super holy... your night! Barbara! Please! I'll be back soon to pick up my things. Where are you going to live? Mary and Joseph. What? Stay here! My house is your house. I told you: racists, all of them! Let's go to the airport hotel, I get a discount... No way! Go to Dubai! Weather better. Business better. People better. Women also... better? You used to throw out her friends. Now you've thrown out Barbara. Merry Christmas! Flight Simulator 3D! Thank you! I have nothing against foreigners. Right? Barbara. Answer it! - No. - They love you. But if you love someone, you have to let go. What if we tried in Dubai? Not against your parents' will. Bad luck. - Is that so with your people? - That is so everywhere. Healthy branch. Family is root. You and me... we do business. Lots of money! Watch out! - I have other problems! - But this is the solution! There is a way. No! You're the first man I propose to. With us, it's the man who does it. Okay... Barbara! I won't marry for a residency permit. Never! - Coward! - Wha...? Dude! What are you doing? She loves you! You didn't even have a present. Oh! - They're all Arabs. - No way! But if they love each other, there's nothing we can do. He's a bit... tanned, but... That's just the outside. Look. When we got married, you were a bit... different. But we integrated you well in the end. Didn't we? Are you comparing me to this... Taliban? Stop it! Get Barbara back! Are there any other airline hotels? - Am I info hotline? - You're not from here, eh. Is always the same: Two days ago have passenger. East German. He say: "You can't find the address? You foreigner!" "Friend!", I say, "I live here since 1980". "You, ten years later!" - Are you East German? - Hey! Stop! Stop! Hey friend! I don't mean that. I don't mind East Germans! It's OK. Forget it. Fucking shit. Yes, yes. Merry Christmas! Yeah, okay! I understand. But we can't stay here. - Why not? - Because it's absurd. I don't know the man! And I am supposed to sleep here? What are you doing here? Will you please come home? For the gift exchange. If you apologize. I apologize. - I'm only coming with Kamal. - No... You could invite him. Very nice! You tell your old man what to do. - Hey, Barbara! That's your father. - Yes. That's my father. My God, Barbara! This place is a pigsty. Salām alaikum! He's right. This is not an place for a woman like you. It's your attic. You can invite who you want. This is your home. All right! He can... Well... You can... uhm... For the holidays. As a guest, so to speak... right? And after that, we'll see. What's going on? - Gottfried? - The Arab is coming. Does your father always do that? What? Should she run away with him? We have him under control here. Good to have you back, Barbara! Come in, Mr. Camel! Yes! We have a sofa in our hobby cellar. - I often sleep there when... - Good night! Good night. I'll take him under fire. Until he gives up and leaves. I made a big mistake. Once the pirates are aboard, the ship is lost. Oh, let not thy blood and thine anguish be lost on me! In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Oh man! It doesn't stop. If they can do it, so can we. No, leave it! Don't, Lisbeth! They'll hear everything. Just when you retire... My house is not a harem! Whoever lives with us must follow our rules! Kamal! The heating... Are you warm enough? Enjoy your meal! White sausages at Christmas? Why? Where's the salmon? Dad wanted something Bavarian. Is it veal or pork? - Veal. - Pork. Kamal doesn't eat pork. It's made from both. A white sausage is always mixed. All right! "Mixed" also describes us. Right? No, no, no, no....! You do it quite differently. Like this! Look! You do it like this. Like a zipper. Is it good? At home, we always "zuzeln". Suseln. Weißwurst zuzeln! Weißwurst zuzeln. Good! Right, watch me. You take it in your hand and... zuzeln! Don't! We eat in this house... with fork and knife. Gottfried, he's used to eating with his hands. Right? - Do you also zuzeln? - No. Well... - We would thank that barbaric. - Oh, barbaric? Look who's talking. By the way, "barbarian" is an Arabic word. "Barbari". For people without culture. Barbarians don't speak properly. They only say: Welcome to Bavaria! Eat your sausage with gloves if you like! Greetings! Imagine: Last night... - The Hinrichs? - That's right! - Greetings! - Hello! Such a pretty girl, and such a boyfriend! - Who is he? - You'll soon see! By the way, coffee is also an Arabic word. "Qahua". "Quaqua"? Did you know that, Barbara? There are more Arabic words. carafe, cinnamon, sugar... Even alcohol: "Al-kuhl." Alcohol?! We shall see. The Crusaders brought sugar from Palestine. Arabs had surgeons and mathematicians.... Teutons were still sitting on trees! I didn't know that! The word "alcohol" stems from the Arabic al-kuḥl (Arabic: الكحل‎)... So? "Alcohol" is not in it. The Arabs even invented the zero. And stopped counting. ♪ In Bethlehem was born... ♪ ♪ to us a little child... ♪ ♪ This one I have chosen... ♪ ♪ I want to be his own. ♪ ♪ Ay, ay. ♪ ♪ I want to be his own. ♪ I know, I know, that stuff comes from Arabia, too! ♪ Into his blessed love ♪ ♪ I will submerge completely ♪ ♪ My heart I want to give him... ♪ He's handsome! ♪ My heart I want to give him... ♪ Is he an oil sheikh? ♪ My heart I want to give him... ♪ No, a Muslim! ♪ And everything... ♪ I see! ♪ I have. ♪ ♪ Ay, ay. ♪ ♪ And everything I have ♪ They were strangers: Mary and Joseph. People's hearts were closed shut, like their doors. But today... There's a church above the manger in Bethlehem. And the door is open to all people. But... The door is tiny. So tiny that every visitor must bow. - Is that true? - Yes. But we made the door so small because the Turks would ride through the church. Silence! As one hears, our parish also has a visitor from Bethlehem. He has come a long way, our Mr.... - Camel. - Camel. Ever since I married Lisbeth, there has been another man. She does not share her bed with him, but the confessional. He wouldn't marry us because I was a Protestant. If you ask me... - The next pope will even be a Negro. - Yes. But he's a Muslim. That's why I became a Catholic. And a church-allergic. And if you need anything at all: anytime, anytime! All of a sudden we got a lot of Christian sympathy. As if we didn't have a guest, but a virus. What is that? Oh yes, a book. The choir sisters had planted a landmine. Its explosive power was precisely calibrated. ...and then my daughter Martha... They rape you, they steal your money, they kill you. And hand you over to the... pasdars. Were these horror stories spread by the government...? He tried to kidnap his daughter. Who? She married a Muslim. She went with him to Iran. He locked her up and tried to kidnap her daughter. Then she escaped on horseback. With the daughter. Don't worry so much and sleep! I can't sleep anymore! What's the use of believing in God, if you still worry as much as I do? What's that? Betty Mahmoody Not Without My Daughter Oh no, dad! Right here! I don't have any children to kidnap. Yes. But read this! "Statutory rape"! Good morning! Again! The man is Persian. I'm Palestinian. We don't kidnap children. We skyjack airplanes! Besides, the American kidnapped the child. - Because he locked her up! - Mom! This is a horror story! In Germany, this man met someone on the Internet. And the guy cut him up and ate him! Should I be afraid? Are you going to eat me just because you're German? Why can't he become a pilot? He must have a residency permit and a European passport. He is doesn't seem like a terrorist, or a fanatic. - Not a suicide bomber. - Dad! He gave me this book. When love beckons you, follow it! And when its wings envelop you, give yourself to it! That's his Arab soul. Yes, he doesn't seem bad. But it's always the nice, harmless, inconspicuous ones.... But I'm only doing what you taught me. Like the book says: Tolerance, charity. All people are equal. - We have nothing against strangers. - Ah! But marriage is a daily minefield of misunderstandings. I don't know any man who understands me like that. And who loves me as I am. And? With you and mom it happened quickly too. Yes. But Lisbeth was pregnant. You know her mother: Immediate marriage, Catholic, no arguing! Our relationship is not the issue. But with Palestinians? A rocket flies through auntie's roof in the Gaza Strip. Who pays? The rich uncle in Germany. But he's unemployed, so the wife must pay! - Dad? - Yes? I love him! I could not argue with this statement. Barbara? I didn't know why I did it. But I said: I promise you... I'll be nice to him. From now on. German technology. My father always says... "The West has clocks... but we... have... ...time!" Checkmate! Is an Arabic word. "Shah mat"... The days passed. Everything was peaceful. And then came New Year's Eve. Barbara was cooking fondue with Lisbeth. And I took the Palestinian to buy... explosives! And these two rockets. That's it! How much? - I'll pay. - No way! 117,30! I live here, I'll pay. Is something wrong? Go ahead. Make room in the galley! - I have to tell you something. - What? These missiles are heading into their bedroom. Where are they going? I think you were right. No! Mom! Dad! Gottfried? You'll be a grandfather! This was not a virgin conception. But a failure of Western pharmacy. Normally ... the father has to do it. But my father is not here. So I ask you on his behalf, if you will grant his son... that is, me... in the name of Allah, the hand... - ... of your daughter. - Kamal! I love her! I love her! Maybe my father needs a little time. Yes. Of course! We're going to fix dinner. Yes? For five people! Can you come here? Please, Gottfried. The downfall of the West was a done deal. I couldn't say "no" any longer. The only thing left to do was: not to say "yes!" Your children are not your children. They are the children of the longing of life for itself. Why did you ask my father, not me? 'Cause he's your father? - Here, you ask the woman first! - You already said yes. Me? - I asked you! - You asked me? I did. You said no. Because of the permit. Because I love you! You wouldn't marry me because you love me? But I will marry you! You me? Then ask me first! I don't decide that, and neither do you. He does! Him? How do you know it's a boy? Male intuition? It will be a girl. Boy. Girl. Boy. Girl. Will you marry me? Kamal! I'll find work, don't worry! - Who will cook? - I can cook. - Change the diapers? - You want a husband or mommy? Do I even want a child? Mr. Camel! Stand up! You're freezing. That won't work. Barbara! Can I have an answer now? This ground is cold! You're not the first woman this has happened to. And not the first to refuse a life behind the stove! Was I wrong to give up my singing studies because of you? Yes! No! But you could have had a career. At the State Opera, maybe? But then you wouldn't be here. Listen to me! You're pregnant. That is a gift from God. So be glad about it! What about daddy? Marry who you want to marry! With or without Gottfried. Kamal! I... Now I know why Arabs go straight to the father. - Be reasonable! - We don't even know his parents. How will we even talk to them? Abracadabra? They are in the oil business. There's no oil in Palestine. He's lying! They must be camel breeders or bomb makers in Gaza. You stop that! It doesn't matter, the child stays here. How do you know he won't take it? And Barbara too. To the barbarians! Stop it! Or I'm going with them to Bethlehem! Happy new year, papa. Come back. Forget the airplanes. You're an Abu Khalil! We have enough lands. I will make it. Don't worry. Pray for me. Don't be a stubborn mule like your old father. Marry Jalal's daughter. Live in our house. We are growing old. May Allah protect you, I love you. Give a kiss to mom. My Lisbeth! She had a cure for every adversity of life: The higher authority. Glasses lost: a prayer to St. Anthony. Barbara is away: Holy water. Daughter pregnant: Catholic wedding. As if the divine blessing would clean up any blemish. And yet: it held our marriage together. But at what cost? Are you serious? A mixed religious wedding ceremony? There's no such thing. A Catholic marriage... Yes, you already said that 30 years ago! Be quiet! God says "yes" to you when you say "yes". And as faithful as His love, so shall your marriage be. Christmas brew from the monastery. 6.5% specific gravity. It's a stunner! No, thank you. You get 40 virgins in heaven instead. The difference: In Islam, marriage is a civil contract. The man can easily dissolve it. He just has to say three times: "I disown you!" - Cheers! - Cheers! The woman can also separate. If the man does not fulfill his marital duties. In our country, you marry for life. One does not assume there will be a separation. After all, it held with you two as well. Say something, Gottfried! We can make two weddings. First here and then in Palestine. You don't say! Half Catholic, half Islamic is not possible. One or the other. - But we are half-half, that's fair! - And the children? The father gets custody there! I think we should have shared custody. Right? Yes. And if you cannot reconcile that with Islam... There's still another option: Convert. It didn't hurt Mr. Hinrichs to become a Catholic. You should know. No thanks! But shared custody is okay. Well, we can't force you. But the children must become Catholic. You don't have to convert yourself. But you have to take note, that your wife must undertake to raise your children in the Catholic faith. Here is the form. Take it, read it and bring it back signed! Never! You can have anything from me. But my children are free people. Allah could have made all people Muslims. But there are people of all colors. And you want to make everyone the same? - Who are you? Greater than Allah? - Kamal! We threw the Crusaders out of Palestine. Now you want the soul of my children? Barbara! Let's go! The Muslim had dropped his mask. I suddenly found him likeable. They are my children! Barbara! Kamal! That's enough! Come out! Turn that shit off! - That's Yusuf Islam! - It's Cat Stevens on Valium. Show some respect. This man gets it. He's freed himself. Get a job! No application, no humiliation. Racists, all of them! Kamal! It's not a conspiracy. Okay? Lisbeth! What if we had just gotten a civil marriage? I think we would not be together. Not without God's blessing. The silence was eerie. For three days. Then he reappeared. Here is the solution! Millions of Muslims have been waiting for this. And...? This will bring world peace and feed my family. - Good day! - Shh! For Muslims in Europe, where no muezzin calls! I'm going into business with Yusuf! We will sell over the Internet. We already have customers in Chicago. Business premises? Here? He says this is his personal Intifada. ♪ ...In Jerusalem. ♪ ♪ Behold, thy King cometh to thee ♪ ♪ Yea, He cometh, Prince of Peace ♪ ♪ Rejoice, daughter of Zion ♪ Islam is the last... anti-capitalist... movement. Your fucking business! You're the biggest capitalist of all! ♪ ...from this vale of tears. ♪ Capitalism? That's the revolution. El Intifada! El Intifada? El Intifada? This is my Intifada! Barbara! No! - Are you crazy? - You're driving me crazy! It's either that thing or me! - This is our future. - This is your past! That business will make us rich. "Us"? You! And what about me? In Islam, the man takes care of his family. I will never wear a hijab! Islamic countries were ruled by women when Merkel was still behind the wall! Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia! The Prophet said: "Paradise lies at the feet of mothers." I could have hoped they wouldn't marry. But I wished Barbara only, that the quarrel should finally stop. - You are oppressing me. - Oppressing you? You oppress me! "Mattress" comes also from Arabic. - Kamal, we're having a baby! - I know! I work day and night. No German will give me a job! You never ask how I feel! I don't know anything anymore. My body is going crazy! I am not allow to fly anymore! I'm pregnant and I'm all alone! Habibti! [Darling!] I'm sorry! Good morning, son! Good morning, papa. Are you growing a beard? Who's that? My papa. Sleep! Who's that? My cat... Ask if they're coming to visit! How's mom? She asks when you're coming back. They can't come. Mom has a cold. Who are you talking to? To my cat. So what? A cold? Doesn't matter! Your cat can talk? Her voice is strained. She has a cold. Germany is very cold. I want to talk to him. Your cat speaks German? Give me that. Hey! It's a German cat. Is mom ok? What are you doing? Is mom content? Hello! Very pretty, German cats are! Son! Who is that? My German teacher. Your German teacher. - Did you tell him I'm pregnant? - Pregnant? - Who is pregnant? - You speak German? Why didn't you tell me? Papa, I really must go to work. I'll call you back later. You ass! Why didn't you tell us about the woman? What?! But Papa, calm down! Please, it just happened... It's not really all that bad... I would have told them everything. After the wedding. After the wedding it's OK?! That's illogical. Since when is life logical? When I see you, I'll beat you up, son! Of course, life is illogical. So we had less than 2 weeks to prepare for what might be called... a family reunion. Barbara - My father. My mother. Salām alaikum! We welcome you, Barbara! My sister Amina, my brother-in-law Bashar. Welcome to our family! My name is Muhammad Abu Kamal Abu Khalil. My wife, Latifa Um Kamal. - Greetings! - Nice to meet you! Yeah... Hinrichs. Joe! Hinritch!! Hinritch? It was shortly after 3 pm. The friendly takeover washed our guests straight into our warm house. My God! Madness! Do they all have a hotel? I don't know, Mama. Right! Shoes... Please put your shoes there. Show them the living room! - Hinritch! Come with me! - Yes. Amina? The gifts. They really are in the oil business. On a grand scale. Olive from the Holy Land. My trees. Made with my own hands. Eat, Hinritch! He doesn't like olives! You don't like olives? Good, Hinritch? Yep! - Here, Barbara! - Thanks! So, Mr. Camel! German... very good! Very strong! Goethe! - A cookie? - Mercedes! Schweinesteiger. Goal! - Goal! Goal! - Yes. But Bethlehem... Bethlehem also very good. Jesus, Mary, Joseph. We love Jesus, Mary and Joseph! My country... - Old trees. - I say... - Great! - 2000 years. - Awesome. Beautiful. - Jesus comes to this tree. He sits in the shade... - And eats olive. - Jesus? Really? - You must come to Bethlehem! - Yes. Hinritch! So much work... About 12 hours later, we knew... why the word 'sofa' also comes from Arabic. They didn't sit on it, they became one with it. - The one with the crooked leg. - The one who was in prison. - No. The one who fell from the tree. - He was operated on in the hospital. Well... Yes... We've had a long day. It was wonderful with you. - But it was... - Hinritch! You... - What? - You're coming with me. Come! Come! Hinritch! I know. I know. Woman German, man Muslim. - Today it is no longer so. - Hinritch! I'm a father, you're a father. Always worry about the kids. I give you that piece of land. You're generous. But I can't accept that! What is more precious to a father than a daughter! No gold can outweigh that. But I'll give you a piece of my heart: the land! We'll talk about it. But what about Barbara's religion? Allah gave her religion. Let her keep it. In my country: Muslim, Jew, Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox. They all cause trouble. Big trouble! Kamal, my son, can work here in Germany. Better! - So you can marry here. - Normal. - Catholic? - Islamic. - No priest? - Imam. Normal. - I have to ask my wife. - Trouble? Nope. No problem. You cannot do that. You can't! God damn it! One time in your life, you are going to wear a veil. At your wedding! In church! And then never again. Translate, Mr. Camel! - Mom! Wait a minute! - We get married in church. - IN THE CHURCH !! - Mom! - In the church? - Kamal! What did he say? I told you. Disaster! Mom! We could simply marry in a registry office. In a registry office? No! They're all divorced themselves. No. This requires a moral authority. He's right, his father. Yes. But... Where are we? Where are we? Here! We are here! And no Imam is going to do it. This is for our priest Joseph! My son does not submit to anyone! Over him comes only Allah! Don't let them oppress you, Barbara! Gottfried! Say something! Barbara! Say yes! Your father traipses in here, makes a takeover bid ... - and everyone says yes?! - It's a fair offer. We'll live here, but at least we'll have an Islamic wedding! He could speak to me! But I'm just the wife. You are the wife and he's my father! We're not barbarians! Not camel drivers! We are the Abu Khalil! We are respected in our country! Then go home and LET THEM ALL RESPECT YOU !!! We are leaving. Go, go! You ask woman: you get trouble. Big trouble! Yes. Oh, Barbara! I'll get you a cab. I wanted... ...to get my things. Barbara! Habibti! Barbara! Barbara? It's me. Well, girl? No what? I don't know. I'm sorry for making such a fuss! Hush! What about him, out there? I don't know. I don't know! Do you love him? No! I don't love him. My Barbara! It was time to steer the ship back on course. If Allah is like our own God: He always turns a blind eye down here. I don't need 40 virgins. All I need is Barbara. I want her to be happy. I told Father, "Enough! We'll marry in church!" - What did he say? - "Wife! Pack our bags!" Before, after. The difference is: Before, I was a Protestant. After: a Catholic. Did it cause problems? My father got pimples! Bavaria was bad enough. My father was a ship captain. A real one, not like me. An ocean-going freighter. I should have been on it. There! My captain's license. Badge for Long Voyage. But I only made short trips. Across the pond. Do you regret it? You cannot choose who you love. That's how it is. You make a choice. And you stand for it. Did your father... How do you say? Disown me? No. But he never came to visit and we hardly ever saw him. He told me on his deathbed: "Gottfried! You are getting oppressed!" He wasn't entirely wrong. - So you do regret it. - No! Lisbeth and Barbara are my life. But... With every marital quarrel I had to think of what my father said on his deathbed. Another little one? Yes. Thank you! Yeah, well. So this was one of those... moments of clarity. That is, I saw what was over the horizon... Kamal's parents were made of the same stuff as Lisbeth: Hard as nails. But not tempered steel, like my father. Hardwood is alive. It has a soul. An unbeliever like me will never understand that. Then again, one can't understand everything. It is enough to respect it. Stop! Wait! Kamal told us that Arabs invented almost everything. The zero, alcohol. You got Jesus, too! - I'm sure you've heard of King Solomon. - Suleiman! Two mothers are fighting over a child. Solomon says: "Pull at the child! Take one arm each!" But one mother can't do it and lets go. And Solomon knows: This is the real mother! - The prophet says so in the Qur’an. - But the Bible came earlier! And therefore I believe: They should not be married by a priest. Gottfried! What are you doing? And also not by an Imam! Then who? By someone... who wishes for both of them to love and respect and be faithful to each other. Not because of a religion! But because he understands what these kids want to do. Which will not be easy! And because he loves them both. Here, my captain's Badge for Long Voyage. It gives me the legal authority to marry a couple on a ship. Please forgive me! Hinritch! This marriage... All eyes are on you. And Allah... ...sees all! Between you and me, I gambled for high stakes. In 38 years of service, I had never performed a wedding. But I had backup: Mrs. Gschwendtner from the registry office. Divorced, of course! She took care of the formalities, while I took care of the form. You look beautiful. I'm very proud of you. Okay? Kamal Hussein ibn Muhammad ibn Kamal Abu Khalil! Opinions differ on whether God or Allah are watching. But one thing is certain: I will keep my eye on you. Do you take my daughter Barbara Hinrichs to be your wife? And promise to be true to her, in good times and in bad? To love, respect, and honor her? I do. Barbara Hinrichs! Do you take Kamal Hussein ibn Muhammad... ...ibn Kamal Abu Khalil for your-- Papa! I willingly promise to be a faithful wife to you on good days and bad. In love and devotion I will stand beside you In the name of Allah, the most merciful, the most gracious. You may kiss the bride. Islamic priest can have wife. - Four wives! - You don't say! Never too late, my friend! May I have this dance, Captain? You are the most beautiful woman on the ship. You look great too. Yusuf! Say Papa! Papa! My daughter and son-in-law had a normal marriage. - He means his sister Maryam. - Mary. Her name is Mary. Maryam! Say Yusuf! Yusuf! - Why don't you call him Joe? - I'm not calling my son Joe! Sometimes I thought about helping them solve marital conflicts. But then I thought about Lisbeth and me. And I knew: They have an entire lifetime to figure that out, as well. They'll sleep eventually. - Call me when you arrive! - We do. After New Year's Eve, we set off. Already after a short distance we knew: Once you stop worrying about the kids, you have all the time in the world. Lisbeth gave me a trip to the North Sea for Christmas. And I gave her a trip to Bethlehem. A long voyage. In Bethlehem, we realized that we don't need to see the rest of the world. Because in the end, the same story is happening everywhere.
