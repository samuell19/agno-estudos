Oh! Oh, oh, ah! What a place. It's worse than home. I... I don't like it here. Not one bit. All I ever wanted was a little patch of green. There. There's my patch. I'm safe in here, and I'm never going out of this cave... Ever again. Hillary, have you seen my briefcase? In your hand, dear. Ah... HILLARY: My... This trial certainly seems to have you rattled. Nobody's cooperating. I'll have to work a miracle to win it. Hmm... Plaid or striped? Just a regular miracle would do. And then, dad and me are gonna sail in my boat and then we're gonna have ice cream, and I'm gonna have double chocolate. Hey, Rosie, don't touch that! Only me and dad get to go. This is just for me and dad. Ready to go, dad? Finally.Great! You're not coming. Your father's off to a meeting, honey. But you promised to take me to the park! Oh... you know I have an important case to prepare for. The park will have to come later. Later, later. It always has to be later! Why can't we ever do what I wanna do? I wanna do what I wanna do! I'll see you all tonight. Your father works very, very hard to make our life nice, children. Now, you have to learn to appreciate that. Hey, Mom, will you take us to float my boat? Oh, Gus, honey, I have an open house on Park Avenue today. But Maria's here.Yeah, cooking and cleaning. Ah, good gracious. I'm late. Now... Be a good boy, please. And keep an eye on Rosie.

I can grow things. Do you wanna watch me? Um... Get a load of this. Flower. Huh! Bug! Ew! Uh-oh. Yippee! Troll. I knew it! I knew you'd like that! I knew it! Oh, we're a lot alike, you and me. My mummy used to read me stories about humans, you know, before she put me to bed, but you are the first one that I have ever met in person. Howcha do? Troll. Yes, yes, oh, but I'm not like other trolls. I'm... I'm different. You know, I mean, I like beautiful things, like flowers. Flower. Yes, flowers, yeah. Oh, please, tell me your name. Rosie.Oh! Rosie? Did you hear... Rosie. Oh, yes! I like that a lot. I like you a lot too. Oh, and I'm so sorry about the place being such a mess. It doesn't have to be, you know. Oh, no. It could be so beautiful.

Hush up! Hush up! Hush up! Hush... Hush... hush... Hush up! What's that? What's what, love lumps? It sounds like... someone in pain. I don't hear anything. Shh! Shh! Why, it's a baby crying. Ooh! She sounds so... miserable! You see, Llort, lovey. Life does have its unexpected joys. How I love to watch a helpless creature suffer. Stop attacking me! Why do you always have to attack me? Down! Sit! Stay! Sit! Down! Time for beddy-bye. Okay, now drink your stupid bottle! But then, we go home! Oh, "bottle." Of course. Come on, dolly. Show us the old smile. Hey, this is serious. Ah, step aside, chumps. I'll show yous how to make the kid smile. Hey, what are you doing? You'll see. Hey, I get it! The old soft petal. Come on! Follow me! Oh, boy! "Worse than death"? "Slow and painful"? Does that look like misery to you? Tell me. Does that look terrible to you? It looks nice, very nice. Don't you think so, snooksie-poo? Yes, I think so. That's precisely what's wrong... You moron! Punishment isn't supposed to be nice. It's supposed to be punishing. I should have turned him to stone like I wanted to in the first place! Perhaps... perhaps, you're overreacting, love lumps. It can't be as bad as... As good as all that. I know that place. It's... It's very-- Oh, look! What's happening to it? Oh, well, you have to wait. Wait? Wait for you to wreck it even more? It looks stupid! Oh! He's more troll-like than Stanley! He's rude! He's smart-mouthed! I adore him! And I'm going to send him a little something that will finish our Stanley for now and forever! The boy will cry a sea of tears. The wind will blow them well. A thunderbolt to shake their hearts... And drown them in the spell! Oh, come on, it's not so bad. I think it looks quite... Flor-adorable. Gnorga. What's happening? STANLEY: It's Gnorga! She's put a curse on you! That's right, you happy sap! We are finally going to be rid of you once and for all! No, don't! Do you think maybe you could stop now, huh? Rosie! Rosie! Rosie, hold on! Stanley! Do something! Hey... I'm not crying any more. I've stopped. How'd that happen? Why, I believe you believed in saving your sister so much, that for just a moment there, your... Your power was stronger than Gnorga's. It was? Yeah. Oh, sure! That was a good deed. I believe there's no end to what you can do if you set your mind to it. I keep thinking when I find my patch of green, I'll invite every good troll to come there and live with me. And they'll do good deeds, and they'll have green thumbs. Green thumb. Just like me. Boy, you sure like to dream a lot. Oh, sure. You have to. Anything that's real starts with a dream. Look, Gus. See this boat? This is no ordinary boat. This is a dream boat. And I'm gonna show you how it works. Look. Look out there. I... I don't see anything. Look again. Where? Oh... Whoa, Stanley, watch out! We're going to crash! No way!

Well, first, relax. Now think of something fun to do. Okay, okay, I'm thinking.Good. Now hold on to that thought. Yeah! Hold on, Stanley! Hey, hey, hey... Hey, slow down! Don't you know dreams are fragile things? There we go. Full speed ahead! Wow! Ooh, wow! Ooh, wow! I hope you get some better thoughts in your head than that. That... That was more like a nightmare. Don't you think we'd better get home, Rosie? Home. Stanley.Yeah? Would you teach me how to have a green thumb? Okay. We could make flowers. Right. And blow them all to smithereens. Wouldn't that be cool? "Gnorga and Llort... Laughing stock? No authority"? "Bad trolls turning good at record pace"? Have you seen this? Seen what, sugar shins? These blasted editorials! They say our power's slipping. We have no hold on our people. Oh. Oh. Don't they know bad press clears up my exquisite warts? Maybe it's time we told them we drowned that pitiful little freak! That is, once you make sure we really did drown him. Good night. See you first thing in the morning. I told you to make sure he's gone! Ooh... ooh! I don't see him, llama legs. I mean, look. Not a hint. Not a trace. Not a clue. What is it? Uh, nothing. Nothing. Nothing to worry your pleasingly plump little head. I need you to tell me, Llort. Did I or didn't I put that wretched little creature out of my misery? Well... Not... not strictly speaking, bunny bum. What? I said--I heard what you said. What I want to know is why! Why didn't we do things my way to begin with? Be careful with that! Do you know what they're saying about us? Finished! Washed up! They're calling for us to resign! They're afraid any troll anywhere can start being good without warning. Think of it. I can't think of it. It's too dreadful. Too mortifying. It can't happen. I'll go there myself and finish that happy little mutant... tonight! No! No, my dear! No! That place is too dangerous! Besides, it's green. Wind, wind, howl in the dark. And trash the place called Central Park. Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Rosie. Rosie, wake up. We have to go. Come on. It's late. We've got to go home. Go. Troll. He'll be okay. Come on. Shh! Before he wakes up. Mm! Troll, troll. Troll, troll, troll. Troll, troll, troll. We have to get home before mom and dad. Uh.GUS: Come on. Wow. What happened? I don't like this. It's okay, Rosie. It's okay. Come on. We better go home now. Yes. You said it was big. Yes. You told me it was wide. But you didn't say it was bigger than troll-world and gremlin-land and goblin-ville put together! How in the name of "shartarb" are we ever going to find him? Oh, I don't know, cow ears. It was your idea to come here... If you don't mind me saying so. Well, I do mind your saying so. My feet hurt, my warts are getting blisters and my corns are getting bunions. Oh, but wait. Shh. What's this? Troll boy with the nasty temper? And look. That sweet, adorable little baby. Ugh! Ugh! Horrible creature, isn't she? After them! Hang on, Rosie! Hang on! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait for me, tootsy toes! Gotcha! I think we lost them, Rosie. Rosie? Rosie! What am I going to do? Um... Uh, I'll get Stanley. He'll know what to do. Stanley! Wait. What time is it? Oh. It's nighttime. All right, tell you what. Come back tomorrow when the sun comes up, and I'll... discuss it with you. Good night. Oh, Stanley! Wakey, wakey! I've got the little baby! I've got the baby! But, oh! What? Who? Stanley! Stanley! Stanley. Gnorga! Gnorga! Oh! She's here! She's got Rosie! You've got to help me get her back! No, no, no, I can't--You're the only one who can help! You've got the green thumb! Stanley! I've got the baby! Uh! Easy! Come on! Stop being such a scaredy-cat! Yeah, but what can I do? What about all your powers, Mr. You've-got-to-believe green thumb? Oh, no, no, no. My prestidigitation is no match for Gnorga's magic. Oh, sure! You're just saying that because you're scared to fight her! I can't! Gnorga... Oh, you don't know gnorga. She'll destroy me. She'll marbleize me. Well, I'm not scared! I'd help you if I could, but I can't. She'll turn me into stone. And I don't want to be rockenized. Gus! Don't you understand? In the troll world, darkness always triumphs over light. You know what, Stanley? You'll never have a dream come true. And you know why? Because you're too scared to fight for what you believe in! You're a coward! Why did I listen to you and send him here? I should've sent him to goblin-ville. They know how to deal with a smiling, happy troll. Come on. Shh. Hush up! Hush up! Hush up! Hush up! You're a booger. I'll turn you into stone. Let me at her! Wait! She's our bait! I want her hurt! Um, no! We need her to attract Stanley. Stop attacking me! Why do you always have to attack me? Down! Sit. No! That mutant little troll has proven himself to be monstrously more trouble than he's worth. I know. I quite agree. That's why we truly need the little baby. To bring him here, so we can finish him. Remember? Come on, now, take a deep breath. Inhale. Exhale. Good.What's that? Inhale. Exhale. Will you hush up, Rosie? Gus! After them! Let's get outta here! Let me go, you ugly, disgusting troll! Gus! You want to act like a troll? Be a troll! I'm not fooling anybody. Oh. And they're in trouble. Trouble! I have to go to them. I'm going. I'm going! What kind of a good troll am I? I'm going! So what if Gnorga finishes me. I'm going! I have to go. I'm going! I'm going. I can't! I'm not going. Oh, go away. I'm a coward. Stop it! Rosie! No! No! Ow! Be careful! No! What's happening to me? Rosie! Rosie! Gus. Rosie? Rosie! Stanley! Stanley! Yes! Gotcha! Gus! Well! What do we have here? We... We beat Gnorga. You better believe it. You did it, Stanley, you did it! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Oh, not yet he didn't. Touch him. Touch him. You little troll, touch him! Touch him! Touch him! It is done! I felt terrible about having to run out. He was so upset. Well, apparently, he recovered pretty quickly. Maria said they were both so quiet all afternoon, she hardly knew they were here. That's a little strange. I haven't seen him suck his thumb in years. Hmm. Well, we both have been terribly busy lately. Maybe he's feeling a little insecure. Night-night, my babies. Morning. Hi, Dad. Ah. Who's your friend? Oh, your mom said to tell you breakfast is ready. Still mad at me for yesterday. Well... what about today, huh? You know, your mother and I, we've... We've thought of a few real fun things we could do today. Dad, do you think today, maybe, we could do what I want to do? And today, park officials are counting the cost of clearing up after a freak tornado ripped through Central Park, devastating the entire area. Stanley. Gussie. Let's go. Bye, Stanley. Bye, Stanley.
