In the wilds of Kenya... water is life. The elixir without which nothing can survive. During one of the worst droughts for two decades, a film crew sets out to discover how the animals survive. Working closely with local experts and conservationists, they follow the lives of three remarkable animal matriarchs as they struggle to keep their families alive by Chasing the Rains! Filming a major wildlife series is never easy... ...especially in Northern Kenya, where long periods of drought are increasing because of climate change. But here, there are many local experts who know every inch of this land. And they are on hand to help the film crew document the long dry season. We are going up this one. That's just great. The first job, is to choose the three animal matriarchs who will become the stars of Chasing the Rains. And there's no species better suited to tell the story of drought, than elephants. It's May in the Samburu National Reserve. The April rains have recently fallen. The land is lush... ...and the great Ewaso N'yiro river is full and flowing. Samburu is famous for elephants and in this time of plenty, they arrive in their hundreds to drink, bathe and eat by the riverside. It's no coincidence that Save the Elephants, one of the world's leading wildlife charities, has its headquarters here. They've been monitoring and conserving elephants for nearly thirty years. And it's to Samburu, the Chasing the Rains film crew head. The team consists of Producer, Faith Musembi, Director Cameraman, Justin Purefoy, and local driver, Sammy Msafiri. They will work closely with Save The Elephants to find the right family to film. Go ahead, Sumaro. They recruit Samburu elder and specialist elephant guide, Sumaro Lecharkole. I've been working with Save The Elephants for about 20 years now and they taught us how to identify through ears and shape of the tusks. It's really something that makes me very proud because Samburu is a unique place, especially filming elephants. All the elephant families here, have been named by Save the Elephants and with Sumaro's help, the crew select the family they hope to follow for the next few months. We decided to follow the Royals, led by Anastasia, the matriarch, because they're one of the best studied families in Samburu. It was a decision that we were happy about because they're a really big group. The Royals are closely monitored by the charity, But keeping tabs on them isn't always easy. Elephants are nomadic, travelling over hundreds of miles, so one of the females in the group wears a radio collar, meaning Save the Elephants can track their movements - a crucial tool in their conservation and handy for the film crew too. Hey! But every now and then, a radio collar breaks. And this has happened in the case of female elephant, Basil. Save the Elephants plan to fix it, and will need the help of wildlife veterinarian, Sharon Mulindi. SHARON: I wanted to be a wildlife vet because my dad, he'd bring home like just any random animal he'd find. So at some point we had like two dogs and like six cats and like a tortoise and like chickens and geese. And it was like a farmhouse. Sharon works for the Kenyan Wildlife Service. Working hand in hand with Save the Elephants, they take on all the wildlife veterinary procedures in Samburu. SHARON: So when you go for veterinary interventions, we usually firstly plan ahead. this is the drugs we need, this is the equipment we need, and we get that organised. We can now go into the field and proceed from there. Basil will need to be sedated in order to fix her faulty collar. That means, darting her with a tranquiliser. The team closes in on the herd. They need to isolate Basil in order to get a clean shot. They've got her. As the sedative takes effect, her family desperately tries to revive her. But their efforts cause her to fall awkwardly. The Save the Elephants team must act quickly to protect her. And temporarily drive the herd away. The clock is ticking. The team mustn't keep Basil sedated for any longer than is necessary. David Daballen, head of field operations for Save the Elephants, is tasked with fixing the collar. Should I just cut it? -I think we have to cut it. -Let's cut. Hacksaw. Sharon too must work fast to take blood samples, which are collected for disease surveillance and species health research. Okay, yeah. David successfully fixes the collar. Putting collars on elephants plays such a critical role because it's almost looking into their brains, what they do, how they're thinking, how they take decisions. So, really there's so much data that comes in just because of GPS tracking data. Basil's movements through Samburu and beyond will help contribute to the long-term conservation of her species. Her family is waiting patiently nearby. And as Basil recovers, they are at last reunited after the ordeal. It's a job well done for David, Sharon and the team. And it's all part of a bigger scheme to help protect the elephants here. Around this area, we have about between 35 collars to maybe even 40 collars. But right across Africa, we have something like 300 collars. Collaring allows conservationists to track elephants in real time, enabling them to study their behaviour. So, there are collars that are actually put for a pure conservation point of view, where do these elephants go. This is just what the film crew needs too, as they embark on following Anastasia and the Royals throughout the dry season. The film crew heads 180 miles south to Naboisho, a conservancy on the edge of Kenya's famous Masai Mara National Reserve. It was established, when Maasai landowners agreed to a radical change in land management that enabled grazing lands to be used for wildlife conservation. It now has amongst the highest concentrations of predators in Africa. And it's cheetahs, that the film crew want to follow. But with so much space for them to roam around in, they're hard to find. So the crew calls in the expertise of professional guide and spotter, Wilson Mpooya. He grew up on these plains and knows more about the animals here than anyone else. To be a guide is to be an ambassador for wildlife. And educate people and show them the beauty of nature. I'm very excited to see animal behaviour, especially cheetahs, the way they run, the way they take care of their cubs. Okay. Wilson has the perfect family in mind for the film crew. We're looking for Kuleta. She likes this rocky area. Difficult to drive through. Oh, my God! It's tough going, but he knows just where to look. That big tree. His instinct is spot on. The crew get their first glimpse of their next major character for Chasing the Rains... the cheetah mum and her four tiny cubs. Kuleta is this young, powerful female cheetah who I think really got under our skin. You know, she's absolutely beautiful. I think she was quite a new mum and we were there when she had this new litter of four cubs. So we were really rooting for her when we met her. But the odds are against Kuleta and her litter. On average, only one in twenty cheetah cubs survive. Cheetah scientist, Brian Schuh, works for the Mara Predator Conservation Project. Cheetahs are always raised with just their mums, so they always have a very tough time. Everything out here is bigger than them. They're the smallest of the big cats - so, whether it be hyenas, leopards, lions, that's all something that could pose a threat to cheetahs and especially their cubs. Kuleta's cubs are thriving now, but challenges lie ahead. As the dry season bites, she's certain to face threats and competition from other predators in the conservancy. Having found their charismatic cheetah mother, the film crew set out to track down their next major character for Chasing the Rains. The third and final location is Laikipia - the rugged highland plateau near Mount Kenya. This, is where a formidable matriarch lives with her family. Phoenix, an African wild dog, with a remarkable story. Phoenix lost her entire pack to canine distemper in 2017 during another bad drought, but amazingly, she survived. Since then, she's raised six litters, and now heads a pack of seventeen. Overseeing the conservation of the wild dogs and the ecosystem they live in is executive director of the Mpala Research Centre, Dr Dino Martins. The African wild dog is a species that ranges over hundreds, if not thousands of square miles. It needs a huge amount of habitat to thrive. So the most critical thing for a species like the wild dog is that we have enough prey, enough food for them to hunt and feed naturally on. And what does that prey need? Well, it needs good habitat, it needs healthy grass, healthy trees and a good ecosystem. A lot of the work done here in Laikipia is around figuring out how animals, wildlife and people and their animals, domestic animals can share that space. Because the dogs need so much space to thrive in, trying to capture them on film during the dry season is going to be a huge challenge. Phoenix wears a radio collar, enabling the conservationists to track the pack's movement. Once again, it will be a critical tool for the film crew. A second cameraman, Jamie Unwin, joins the team. And together research assistant Simon Lima, they set off to find the family. But almost immediately, they hit their first major problem. Phoenix is in her hillside den but as she's recently had a litter of puppies, she's not coming out. On most mornings, we would track the alpha female at the den because she was currently denning. But then the challenge was we didn't know where the rest of the pack was. It was hunting in Laikipia, and to track them would have been like trying to find a needle in a haystack. And that was really challenging for the crew. We were basically a captive audience at the base of that den for weeks on end. At last, the crew's patience pays off and the puppies descend from the den for the very first time. It's a huge relief. JUSTIN: So when the puppies came out, we'd spent a couple of months trying to get some good material of them. And that moment when the puppies came out, you know, it was like we had finally achieved something. But the crew's joy is short-lived. Once the puppies are out, the pack is on the move. And it's almost impossible to keep up! JUSTIN: The crew really were up against it, to be honest, because you do a lot of off road when you're chasing the dogs, it's all guns blazing. It's high adrenaline when they're hunting. You get these small glimpses of them. it was anyone's guess as to where they might go next. And so it was really challenging to get any kind of good shots. The crew will need to rethink their approach to have any hope of keeping up with the dogs. It's June and three months into filming. In Samburu, there has been very little rain, and as the heat intensifies, the Ewaso N'yiro River is shrinking by the day. But thankfully for the crew, there's still just enough food and water for the animals, and Anastasia and the Royals stay close by, enabling the crew to capture the family as they eat, bathe and play. But it's another elephant who grabs their attention when they've finished filming for the day. The crew are based at Elephant Watch Camp - a location also favoured by Samburu's most famous bull elephant - Sarara. Sarara is a bull elephant who regularly visits the camp. And it's his home. So we all have to step aside as he enters the camp and forages for food, and scratches his bum. It's lovely to see an elephant in camp. I lost count of how many times I'd be in my tent working when Sarara would come crashing through the bushes to eat around my tent. We have to be careful because he's still a wild elephant, but he obviously feels safe at Elephant Watch to wander around like he does. It's a good sign, that there is still enough food around in Samburu. But as the drought tightens its grip, that is about to change. Just a few weeks later, there is a dramatic shift in the landscape. It hasn't rained now, for three months. And the great Ewaso N'yiro River, has completely dried up. I think for me the moment the Ewaso dried up was quite shocking. Because Samburu went from having a water source and no food to having no food and no water. But elephants are well adapted to cope with short periods of drought, and the crew are witness to an extraordinary survival technique. Suddenly we watched the elephants wander down to this dry river bed. And they just started digging with their feet and they dug these wells. And I thought that just really said everything you need to know about elephants. They're making really conscious decisions about how to survive. It's an ingenious strategy, but as the drought bites, the elephants will be pushed to their limit. As the rivers turn to snakes of dust, people too, are driven to desperate measures. Thirty-five miles further north, herdsmen are driving their cattle towards water. These, are known as the Singing Wells. These wells have been dug by people for themselves and their livestock. And as they collect the water, they sing for their cattle. It's a tradition that's been part of Samburu culture for hundreds of years. At dusk, the herdsmen leave, and the wildlife moves in. Five thirsty bulls, have been waiting nearby for their chance to drink. These canny males will spend the entire dry season close to these singing wells, drinking their fill every evening. It's working well for people and wildlife to share the dwindling resources... for now. In Samburu, matriarch, Anastasia, decides to leave the dry Ewaso river bed. She leads the Royals out of the Samburu National Park towards remote springs in the north, taking one of the many animal pathways and corridors that weave through Northern Kenya. On one of these corridors, the crew comes across a very special conservation project. A group of local women, called the Mama Tembos - a Swahili phrase meaning "Elephant Mums". They've been employed by Save the Elephants to monitor these corridors because it's here, that elephants often come into conflict with humans. In a drought, humans and elephants can clash over resources - and this especially happens when nomadic people set up camps on animal corridors. Using tracking skills and GPS data, the Mama Tembos monitor the elephants' movements and send an alert if they discover any camps. Since the scheme began, there have been far less incidents of human-elephant conflict. Kennedy Lemaiyan coordinates the project. There's a huge connection between the Mama Tembos and elephants themselves. As you know, elephants, they do live in matriarchal society. And so these women as well, the Mama Tembos, they are the matriarchs of their family. And so they both comprehend each other. Educating and involving local communities in wildlife conservation is a growing movement and it's a highly successful strategy. Well, I think education is really important. It is the key in resolving some of these issues. When communities are educated, when they are informed, then they can make better decisions for themselves and for their wildlife. Fifty-five miles further south in Laikipia, the crew are on the trail of the wild dogs. So far, they've been struggling to get many meaningful shots of Phoenix and her family. And they're covering a lot of rough terrain trying to keep up with them. As the land withers, it's taking its toll on the vehicles. Oh! And, on driver Nelson Kariuki. Ah, so, we just fell in one of the little streams that was completely covered in some grass and some bushes. It's going to take some wily ideas and a little brute strength to get the car out. Woo! [laughing] Driving around trying to catch a glimpse of the dogs is just taking too much time and effort. If the team are going to ever successfully film the pack, they need to change plan. This is our secret weapon. It may look small but it's actually pretty mighty. FAITH: Filming the wild dogs from the air was a game changer. Being able to just get above them and to see how they were travelling because this is something we couldn't possibly see from the ground because the vegetation was so thick. But it was incredible seeing how much ground they covered. So our plan was Simon would track them on the on the ground and then radio in a position, and then we would go in and film the dogs. And for the first time, we were able to start stitching together meaningful sequences. At last, the crew are able to capture this elusive and charismatic family as they negotiate the landscape through the dry season. But no sooner are they up and running, than a second challenge arises. There has been some recent light rainfall in the highlands of Mount Kenya, filling the local river here, and the dogs have been showing signs that they might cross to more bountiful land on the other side. To maximise filming the crossing, they'll need cameras both in the air and on the ground. Justin and the Samburu team arrive to help. And right away there's exciting news. We just met a car and they saw them. FAITH: Great. Yeah, the car drove past us and said wild dogs, wild dogs. The two teams set off fast. Ah! We've run into a roadblock by camels. At last, they reach the river and they're not too late. The dogs are close. While Jamie operates the drone, Faith has a monitor and can relay where the dogs are to Justin, who's on the ground trying to find the perfect position. JUSIN: Does it look like there's other crossings near you from the drone angle? FAITH: Yeah, it looks like once you go round the bend, there's another crossing that they're running towards. The dogs are literally running parallel to you guys as you're driving around. Justin sets up, just as Phoenix brings the pack to the water's edge. Up above, the batteries in the drone are dying. No!!! Come on! Ah, I can't take it! Just go across! Oh cross, it's not deep! And then, the dogs get the push they need. Hyenas are on their trail. They are in the water, it looks like they're finally going to cross. On the far side, the adults do a head count to ensure every last puppy has made it safely across. It's a great result for the crew too. They've captured the dramatic crossing from all the angles they hoped for. Although there's been a little light rainfall in the highlands, down below, on the plains of Samburu, the land is in severe drought. There is hardly anything to eat. And standing water, is non-existent. As the land dissolves into dust, animals and people alike are suffering. The community has had to dig deeper and deeper wells to access the dropping water table. And this has led to a terrible consequence. A young elephant has fallen into one of the wells. Despite a desperate rescue attempt, tragically, he has drowned. For the locals and the film crew alike, it's a devastating blow. JUSTIN: It was heart-breaking to see elephants dying because they're trying to access water, and the community had stepped in and pulled the elephant out. The calf is a young male, just six years old. He's the tragic victim of the worsening drought. As it got a bit later, the elephant family arrived and they kind of came to pay their last respects. Elephant families have deep bonds and when one dies they experience profound grief just as we do. JUSTIN: It's hard watching elephants grieving as it is any animal. and elephants looking at their dead family, it's hard to digest that. Conservationists are working hard with local people to try and prevent these accidents such as building slopes into the wells so elephants don't get trapped. The Samburu community and elephants actually have a really good relationship, and a story goes that they once lived together and now when any Samburu man or woman passes by an elephant carcass, they will pay tribute to the animal's spirit by leaving a green branch in its skull. It's a really beautiful ritual and it's a really touching thing to see. Further south in Naboisho, the drought is also intensifying. Grazing animals are spreading out, and competition for food is fierce. Kuleta is struggling to feed her fast-growing cubs, and every day the pressure is building on her to hunt down a substantial meal. She becomes desperate. And that leads to a very difficult moment for the film crew. We weren't expecting to film what would be a really, really sad and difficult moment. We'd gone ahead of Kuleta and we saw this Thomson's gazelle, who'd just had her fawn. And as soon as we saw the pair, we knew what was coming. The mother runs away and the fawn disappears into the grass. JUSTIN: Kuleta had focused on the baby from the moment she got there. And for about ten minutes she hunted through the grass like this big bad wolf. And it was really hard to watch. In one way, we wanted the cubs to feed. but in the other sense, we wanted the fawn to make it. Inevitably, Kuleta finds the fawn. It's not easy watching a newborn fawn get killed. But at the same time, it's a really important lesson for the cubs. They need to learn how to kill an animal, and this was a lesson for them that their mum was teaching them. FAITH: I think it's one of those tensions we always feel as wildlife filmmakers. We have to let it play out. You can't intervene. So we had to sit there and watch this horrible scene play out, understanding that it's all part of the beauty of what we love about nature. It starts to get increasingly difficult for the film crew to witness the extent of animal suffering in the drought. FAITH: It was actually horrific seeing how the animals were struggling. I mean, it was completely dry. We would be driving on the road and be completely caked in dust because all the grass was gone. We were just watching these animals somehow surviving. I'll probably never forget what it was like watching all that play out and the animals still figuring out a way, day in and day out. The crew are heading back to camp, when they get word of an unusual incident. An elephant they've become very familiar with is in trouble. JUSTIN: We got this radio call that came in saying that Sarara, the friendly elephant that visits us at the camp had been speared. We saw this spear lodged into his stomach and he was curling his trunk in pain when we got there. Because of the drought, Sarara has wandered out of his normal feeding areas to find food and has come into conflict with people. Sharon and the veterinary team plan to remove the spear as quickly as possible and administer lifesaving treatment. SHARON: Sarara is one of the elephants that probably everyone knows because he's our resident elephant so he's probably one of the big celebrities in the park. But they must be careful when anaesthetising him. If he falls on the spear, it could prove fatal. SHARON: There's so many factors that you have to consider when you're darting an animal. I think everyone holds their breath because you don't know how the elephant's going to react. It's a clean shot. And luckily, Sarara falls on the side without the spear. Aye, aye, aye, aye. The spear is quickly removed. Now it's a race against time before he wakes up. The spear has penetrated 12 inches into Sarara's stomach. Sharon takes blood samples, and administers lifesaving antibiotics. With the wound cleaned, it's finally time for Sarara to be woken up. It wasn't as deep as we thought it initially was. It seemed to be a superficial wound that probably penetrated the muscles but elephants are resilient animals so it should be fine. Sarara will be carefully monitored in the Reserve to ensure he makes a full recovery. It's really good news for this special bull elephant. But his attack is just another symptom of how desperate things have become for both animals and people. There's been no rain now for five months. It's one of the worst and most prolonged droughts here for two decades. In Samburu, communities are getting desperate. I think this is one of the droughts that really hit the Samburu community and up till now, there's still no rain. The animals are dying buffaloes, impalas, cattle, sheep. They're all dying. So we are hoping that it will rain soon. [women singing] A group of Samburu women, including Sumaro's wife, gather to pray, singing and calling for rain. [singing continues] This is an exceptionally rare event, only performed in times of severe drought. FAITH: Getting to film such a special and sacred moment was amazing, and the only reason we could do it is because we'd been working with Sumaro. And his wife was one of the women who was part of the group praying. And that was a really special moment for us as a team and at that point, family. It's an enormous privilege for the film crew, as cameras would never normally be allowed at such a private event. Painted in ochre and dressed in ceremonial robes, the women walk and dance down the dry river beds, singing traditional prayers to encourage rain. It's their very last desperate attempt to bring life back to their parched land. FAITH: We'd been in the throes of this drought for so long and towards the end we started seeing the clouds building up and building up. And every day I think we'd be like, "Oh, today is the day!" And it wasn't. Till it was the day that the clouds broke and the rain came. JUSTIN: It just felt like a huge relief when it started to rain. It was like all that pressure, and all that conflict could start to be eased. We were with the elephants at the time and they had this amazing dust bath almost in celebration. FAITH: One of the images that will forever be burnt in my mind is seeing this family just rejoicing in just being able to have this water mixed with the soil. It was really beautiful. As the climate changes, rain patterns in Kenya are fundamentally shifting, putting intense pressure on both people and wildlife. But by local communities and conservationists working together, there is hope for harmony in the future. Here in Kenya, we have the most brilliant, passionate and capable Kenyan conservationists and scientists. And they are engaged in making discoveries that allow us as Kenyans to conserve our wildlife. They are out in the field. They are following these animals. They love these animals. The passion they bring is priceless. The crew has been inspired too, not only by the incredible people they've worked with, but by the whole experience. JUSTIN: Directing and filming Chasing the Rains has been one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So big! Spending eight months with three animal characters, we were able to see them change and we were able to see their challenges and that was a unique opportunity. FAITH: Chasing the Rains will truly be an unforgettable experience for me because we had this unique opportunity to immerse ourselves truly in this type of storytelling which is rare. We spent day in, day out with these characters. We got to know them, we bonded deeply. We grieved with them, rejoiced with them and that for me will always be memorable.
