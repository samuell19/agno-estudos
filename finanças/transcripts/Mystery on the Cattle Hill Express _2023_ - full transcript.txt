- Klara? What's your position? Over. - Meet me at the barn. Over. - Roger. Over and out. The Farmstead Detective's new case. - The missing rake! - It's like we're Agatha Christensen, the world famous top detective! - I'll need that and that. Someone's lost a button! - What if we get to meet her one day? - Hm? Suspicious looking footprints, hm. - Huh? - Come on, Gavin. Let's go check it out! Someone's here. - Like who? - Yeah. - Wool! - Gavin, sh! Gavin, the lights! Mm-hm. Hey, what are you doing? - I've been caught red handed! Oh. Oh. - Bart? - Yeah. - Uncle Bart? - Oh! My poor butt! Ow! Ow-ow-wee-wee! Have you totally lost your marbles? Scaring me like that? What are you two up to? - We're detectives! - Farmstead Detectives. - Farmstead detectives? - Yes! - Farmstead Detectives? Gavin won't even go to the bathroom at night! - Well, we did catch you red-handed, didn't we? Did you steal dad's rake then? - Hm, huh? Ha! I don't steal, I borrow! That's what good neighbors do. And now, finally, I can get sheared. - Another case solved. The red sheep butt. - Yes! Dad! We solved the case! It was just Uncle Bart who borrowed your rake! Dad? - Yeah ? - Is there still something wrong with the soil? - Yeah. Nothing grows here anymore. - Why not? - If I only knew. I've tried everything. Both crop rotation and intercropping, but nothing works. I just don't know how long I can keep running the farm now. Tried everything. - No longer run the farm? - Huh? - Biff, Biff! I have learned a brand new dance! Maybe it'll help with the soil. Here you go, Biff! - Thanks, Bart. - I only borrowed it. That's what good neighbors do, don't you think? Huh? What is Chickolina up to? - It's a rain d-d-dance. A rain dance! A very old and very rare fertility dance! - Hey, come on, Give it a break! You're stomping all over my seeds! - Biff, I only want what's best for Cattle Hill. You must let me finish. You must have faith in my cluck cluck cluck cluck work! No more bongo drums for you. So this is where the party is at? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We were just- - Biff, I have found the solution! Cattle Hill must be saved! Now, as good luck would have it, I'm both inventive and dynamic! We'll do it with the latest technological innovation, namely, a nano seed! - No, no, no, no, no. You are not planting that in my soil. - Oh, yes, I am! My firm, Greedy Pig Export, Inc. has already invested a lot in your farm, Biff! So, I expect you to do the right thing! This affects us all! - I've tried everything. - What? This is just one huge sand pit! - Bart. - Well, that was pretty funny. - Oh! - We can't let Cattle Hill end up like Rabbit Woods Farm! - What's that? - Rabbit Woods? - No idea. - Who who's th-th-that? - Um, have you found a boyfriend? - Yeah, I met him at Swindon! Albert Einswine! A famous inventor! - Oh! - Don't you think? - I've just eaten my breakfast again? - Listen to me. If you want to be a farmer tomorrow, I recommend you show up at Capitol Hill Train Station at nine o'clock sharp. - What's happening there? - Be there, or be square. Don't miss it. - Yeah, I just don't know. - Maybe it might be exciting to try something completely new. Aren't you at all curious about what'll happen at the station? - Yeah. Maybe you're right after all, perhaps of change of scenery would do is good. Whatever happens down there. Agreed? - Yes, yes. And that seed could save Cattle Hill. - Well, one can always hope, but when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is, Klara. It's called Horse Sense. - Horse sense. - But I'll try to keep a positive attitude. - Oh, where are we going? - We'll find out soon. - She's probably forgotten. That's fine by me. I've got more important things to do. Bless you, Gavin. - Excuse me, I'm a bit sniffly. - Ernie, what are you doing here? - Oh, good morning. I was invited by Paul Lee to take some photos for my newspaper. There's a really exciting business deal happening apparently. - Uh-oh, one minute past 9:00. Well, that looks like this celebrity pig is- Ow, ow, ow! A little delayed. Typical trains, ooh. - Let me introduce myself. I am Albert Einswein. - Huh? - And this gorgeous sow has told me that there is trouble at Cattle Hill. But do not despair, there isn't a problem in this world that I cannot solve. - Biff, I see you came to your senses. - Well, Klara and I haven't been out together in ages. - Smile. - Ah, my newfound friends. Welcome to Metana X, a truly unique laboratory train. Welcome aboard. - Wow. We're going on a trip. - Wow, it was too late though. Woo, that's some bad taste. - Get in, get in. Isn't it great? Isn't it wonderful? - Wow. - Where are we going? - Ah, wow. - Whoa. - In you go. Hm. Ah. Let's get rolling. As you can see, everything's in mint condition, to put it mildly, yeah. Oh. - Doors closing. - Oh. Now do kick back and enjoy the view because now we're heading off like greased lightning. - Oh, wow. If I may ask you, please take a small step to one side because here's a taste of the delicious food we shall enjoy later. Metana X is a train like none the world has ever seen. All facilities are, of course, first class. So just relax and enjoy. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What exactly are we doing on this train? - Where shall I start? Let me show you around the lab train. First car, the sleeper. - Oh, incredible. It works. - Join me in the parlor car. - How am I? - Come, come follow me. Onboard we have food and drink rivaling that of any luxury restaurant. - Oh. Oh! Really? - And should any of the children misbehave, they will end up here. Oh, I am only kidding. You shall now become the very first to observe my beloved laboratory. Yes, go in. - Wow. - Here I have worked long and hard on many different experiments. The tanks hanging up there contain the train's fuel. Metana is a train running on cow burps and cow farts. - Cow burps? - That's cow farts? - Gas, or methane to be exact, hence the name, Metana. - Good morning, Albert. You called? - Oh no, I did not. - You sound smart today. - Toot toot, thank you. Metana is our artificial intelligence. She also runs the train. - Is no one driving this train then? - No, no, don't be afraid. She is much more reliable than any dozy train driver. - Albert, show your audience the main attraction. - Okay. Metana, dim the lights to 15%. - Yes Albert, dimming the lights to 40%. - Thank you, Metana. And now, my dear friends, we've reached the highlight of this journey. Let me present to you my masterpiece Super Seed X. A seed to change the world forever. With Super Seed X, I combine two of my favorite things, gene technology and nanotechnology. - Wow. - Super Seed X is not merely a seed, it's a genetically modified mini robot. Or rather, millions of them. Super Seed X can become whatever you want it to be. You see, it is programmable. Apple tree, onions, strawberries, whatever your heart desires. Let's see, wouldn't you just love a juicy tomato? - How is that possible? One has to try. It's a tad more sour than my stomach is used to. - Super Seed X doesn't need a single ray of sun or even a drop of water to grow . Merely a hoof full of dirt. - Albert, get to the point. - Certainly, Cattle Hill shall become the first farm to make use of this fabulous technology. Cattle Hill and Super Seed X shall become world famous brand names. This train is on its way to my mega factory. The prototype of the Super Seed will be mass produced. - Dad, isn't this fantastic? - Yeah. - The Metana, what just happened? - You forgot to recharge my ridgid. - Well, my dear ladies and gentleman, Super Seed X. - Quite close to the homestead, bBut still, wow. All the same. - That must be an extremely powerful crystal. It'll shower its energy upon Cattle Hill. What do you think, Biff? - I mean, sure. - I now invite you all to a sumptuous celebration dinner in the restaurant car. Follow me. - Oh. - Wow, how cool. - This is awesome. - Oh, oh, oh. What's that? - I don't know. Food, I think. - Oh, thank you for a wonderful day, Albert. - Cheers, Pauline. To the future. - To the future. Cheers. - Excuse me, Pauline, I must go back to work. Please eat like a pig. - Oh,. Waiter! How do you address these things? - I can't sit here and celebrate. - Dad? - Yes. - Waiter! - Super Seed X will make everything grow again. Hm? - Hm. Will it now? - You're so old fashioned. Look around, see where we are. - Well, the main thing is securing a future for Cattle Hill. But you cannot make me eat this food here. I'm going to bed. - No, stop spinning. Waiter, come here now. - Hello? Pig thingies, where's my food? Ooh, I'm starving. Hungry. I'm famished. Yoo-hoo. I'm dizzy, so dizzy. Oh, yum. I'm ravenous now. Tomato soup, huh, well, it will do. I suppose. I need a spoon! I need a spoon. Stop the train! - Why are we stopping? - I need a napkin. - Spoon, spoon. - My seed. My seed is gone! Oh, someone has stolen it. - What is going on? - Someone stolen Super Seed X, my masterpiece. - Oh no. Poor, poor you. And poor me! - That seed could save the world. - That seed could save Cattle Hill. But, can't you make a new seed? You've invented it before. - No, I can't just make a new seed. That was a prototype. The only one of its kind. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hm. The train. Hm. No one leaves this train. The thief is still among us. - It wasn't me, I didn't take it. - One of you must have stolen it. Get me a phone, now! Am I speaking to Agatha Christensen? - Agatha Christensen, the world famous detective. She's my hero. - I need your help catching a thief. Huh? I'll pay you whatever it takes and I will see you at Rabbit Woods Station right away. - Gavin, you finally get to meet your hero. - So, there is a thief on this train? - Oh, Agatha Christensen. - Super Seed X, you must find it. It's my masterpiece. Don't you get it? - Excuse me, please put me down. - Yes, certainly. - Ah. Thanks. So where was this infamous seed last seen? - In the lab car and now it has disappeared without a trace. - Thank you, dear. Excellent. I will take it from here. - Certainly. - Hi, I'm your biggest fan. I have your poster on my wall. I've studied all your cases in detail. The Black Sheep Mystery. Oh, ah, yes. And The Bunny Boiler. Oh, sorry. - I've just realized that I failed to bring any assistance on this trip. - Really? - Are you saying, did we? - That we? I Agatha Christensen's assistants. - Okay, let's get to work. Let me tell you, in no uncertain terms, the life of a private eye is as exciting as can be. - Come on! - Yeah. Pow. - Look, look, Agatha, I found something. - Great, Klara. It could be the suspect's print. Now let's interview all the guests about where they were when the seed was stolen. Come on! - Keep up now. - Bart. - Yes. - Oh, you're nervous. - Eh? - Did you perhaps steal the seed? - No, yes, no, yes, no, no. Yes, no, no, yes. Let me outta here! - Oh, is it true- - I only borrow things. I've never stolen a thing in my life. There's no air. Fresh out of air. Someone stole the air. - Pauline, did you steal the Super Seed? - Huh? Oh, I'm his girlfriend. Better from this angle. - Chickolina, where were you when the seed disappeared? - Oh, just let me check my memory. Oh! What, what are you riding? Oh! - Was it perhaps you? Hm. Biff, where were you when the dinner was served? - No comment. - You're not a big fan of technology, are you? - No comment. - Are you planning on saying no comment to all of my questions? - Yes. I mean, no comment. Huh? What? - Welcome everyone. Please find a place to sit. - Is the investigation complete? - It is. I, excuse me, we have spent the day talking to you to find out who could have a motive for stealing Albert's seed. And the conclusion we have come to is. Biff! - Me? - You want to keep running the farm like you always have. - Biff? - Dad? - You don't exactly approve of Albert and Pauline's plans for your farm, do you? - Biff? - Biff! - No, I've never. - And unlike the passengers in the restaurant car at the time, you don't have an alibi. - Oh! - You, Biff, left the restaurant car early yesterday. - I'm going to bed. - Was it perhaps to steal a certain seed? Klara, show me the print you found on the glass case. Oh, it's a match! It was you Biff, who stole the seed. - But Dad? - I just knew it. I had a hunch that it was Biff. - Klara, it wasn't me! - Fine, you can admit to everything later. Klara. I didn't do it, Klara. I didn't steal that seed. - Yes, I know that, Dad. Of course it wasn't you. - And should I go to prison then I won't be able to stay with you at Cattle Hill anymore. - Biff, where's the seed? Why are you ruining everything for everybody? - It wasn't me who stole the seed. Go ahead, you can frisk me if you want. - Ew, rather not. - No matter why you took it or where you hid it, give it back, and the sooner the better. When I steal stuff, borrow stuff, I find that giving it back to the owner as soon as possible is always helpful. - Dad didn't steal the seed. - Sure, I hear you, but I don't believe you. Well, I'm off to enjoy whatever's left of the free food and excellent service onboard before heading back to Cattle Hill. I'll fatten myself up like a- - Oh, I sense a lot of negative energy in this room. So if anyone else needs to unwind, you're welcome to join right in. - Biff, think of Cattle Hill. Think of Klara. What will become of her if you go to jail, huh? Chickolina! Chickolina! - Pauline's right. I can't go to jail. I'd miss out on everything. Like watching you grow up on Cattle Hill and... You must help me, Klara. - But how? - The seed has to be somewhere on the train, aren't you and Gavin detectives? - That's exactly what we are and we shall prove that you didn't steal the seed, Dad. - But Klara, just be careful. - Hm. - Metana, let me off the train right now. - Agatha! - I beg your pardon? - You can't just leave. - Why the devil not? I've solved the case, haven't I? It was Biff. - And I am forever in your debt, but we are heading back to Cattle Hill where the police are waiting to arrest Biff. I need you here. - Of course, Albert. Of course. - Metana, turn the train around and head for Cattle Hill. Turn it around. - Yes, Albert. - We must find the Super Seed and prove that Dad is innocent and time is running out. Come on, we must search the entire train. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Ow, ow. - Come here you cake waiter. Gavin, now! - I found something. Ready. - Come on. Look! Is the seed back? - A, it must be, hm? - Welcome, Albert. - What are you doing here? - We, we, we would- - We were just- - Get out now! Out, out, out, out, out! - Sorry. Sorry. Oh! Look, this was odd. - Hm - Oh, whoa. Ah, stuffed. Ah. Ah. - A mask? - Yes. - Hm. It's on fire! - Sh. I'm crystal cleaning the energy with alliance. Breathe it out. Free your belly. - Oh! - What is that? - I don't know. - Now the sun is greeting the day. Thank you. - Gum, pebbles, chocolate, wrapping paper. Bits of tomato. We have the shiny button, A twisted spoon and bits from a jacket. We found quite a few things. - Yes, or absolutely nothing at all. It's all garbage. - Huh? - None of this stuff will help my dad, Gavin. We'll be at the station soon and the police are waiting to arrest him. - Oh! Oh, it's the very same coat! Hm, let's see. Huh? Oh. Oh. Huh, Klara! - Look. A hand drawn map of the train. This has to mean something, right? - Hm. - I found it in the coat pocket, huh? - Hm, okay then. Then we must find the owner of the coat. Don't you think? - Oh, I just have to stretch my legs a little. - Ernie? - Oh. You two literally scared the living daylights out of me. - You wouldn't happen to know who owns this coat, do you? - Oh, no, sorry. But say cheese. - Can we borrow your photos from this trip? - Which of them? - All of them. It's incredible how many photos Ernie has taken. - Mm. - Check out Bart. - Typical Uncle Bart. Let's hope he found something. Hm? - There's no sign of the coat. Wait, Gavin, hand me the magnifying glass. Look, right there behind Bart. - Huh? All I see is Uncle Bart picking his nose. No, wait! Ah. I can see two eyes. Ah, someone's hiding in there! That must be the thief, Klara. - The ventilation shaft, come on Gavin. So. Okay, Bart must have picked his nose here. Hm? - There it is. - Oh. - Oh, watch the glasses. - Okay, so this is how the thief got in. - My nose, ouch. - Grab a hold of this, Gavin. - Klara, Albert's laboratory. - I haven't suddenly started caring about Rabbit Woods or any of the other places. - Hm, Rabbit Woods? - I am exempt from all liability for anything that took place there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My point is that whether Super Seed X stays missing or not, there is no need to bother the insurance companies with this information. Now, you must ask them to transfer the 50 million insurance payout to my account in the Cowman Islands. - Uh, uh, uh- - Uh? Hm. Hello? Hm? Hm? - Oh, okay, insurance. - I can't believe it's Albert. Albert's the thief. He's hidden the seed to get the insurance money payout. - So do you get the money if you just lose something? - Or if it gets stolen, it's Albert himself. Albert's the thief! - And the police are coming to arrest your dad! - Come on, we must find the seed. Oh my glasses. - Hm. Okay. Rabbit woods! This is what Pauline was talking about. - But I don't get why all the other farms have been crossed out. - This isn't the first. Super Seed X isn't the first seed. - X, doesn't X mean 10 in Latin or something? - The tenth seed. One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. And Cattle Hill is next! - Your dad didn't do it! We've gotta run quickly and tell Agatha. - Hm. - Alfred is behind everything! We heard him on the phone. He stole his own seed to collect the insurance money and he's framed my dad to get away with all of it. - Mm-hm. - So, Albert? - Yes! - Intriguing by all means. But can you prove it? - We need your help. Albert had left the restaurant car when the seed was stolen. So he had the opportunity. - Excuse me, Pauline, I must go back to work. Please eat like a pig. - Motive and no alibi. Definitely a good start. But we need something to connect him directly to the seed case. Remember that Biff's print was the only evidence found at the seed. - Look Agatha, I found something. - It's a match. It's a match. - Hm, so the thief must have worn gloves to avoid leaving their prints on the glass. - The button. It was inside the glass case. - A? A, A for Albert. - Or A, for Agatha? - What? A C, Agatha Christensen! So it was you? - So it was you. Oh dear, no, no, that's not the case. You are well aware that I came aboard after the seed had been stolen. - It is correct that you got on the train at Rabbit Woods Station. But by then I believe you had already left. You were there. You were there right from the start. - Hm. - Your coat got stuck when you snuck in at Cattle Hill Station. - Let's get rolling. Everything's perfect. - Your coat got ripped and before you knew it, two of the robots ran off with your coat and mask. Isn't that right, Agatha? - Hm. - Have a taste of the delicious food we shall enjoy later. - You hid when Bart's food was being delivered and you stole his spoon. - I need a spoon! - You used the spoon to get into the ventilation shaft. - And then, of course, you know. - You stole the seed without leaving prints. - Huh? Metana, stop the train! - When the train stopped in its tracks, your button snapped. One half fell into the glass case. You immediately realized that you had to escape by the roof. Maybe you could've made it, but things didn't go according to your planning. You assumed you'd left evidence. You nearly got away with it. - Hello, Agatha Christensen. How can I help? - Am I speaking to Agatha Christensen? - That's what I said, what can I do for you? - I need your help catching a thief. - Yes, I can be there right away. Meet me at Rabbit Woods Station. - You then had to get back inside the train. So Albert offering you this case was a stroke of luck. And now you could control the investigation. You could make it seem like someone else had stolen the seed. - So there is a thief onboard. - Agatha Christensen, you are not just a detective, you're also a detect thief. You stole Albert's seed. And my dad is getting punished for your actions. - Not bad, not bad at all my dear assistant. You make me really proud. But even if your claim is true, which it isn't, you cannot prove a thing. And more importantly, who do you think people will actually believe? Two kids? Or the world's most famous master detective? - The seed, it must be in her purse! Ooh. - Hm, hm. - Gavin! - Ah! - Gavin, she's getting away. - Go back, Klara. Please let me finish this. - Oh! - Oh. Klara. Here, take this. I'll go back inside and I'll stop here from there. - Great, Gavin. Wait! Agatha, Agatha, stop! Agatha, stop, it isn't worth it! Go back. Klara. Didn't you hear? You must let me finish this! - Agatha, we can work this out. - Go back. - Agatha, stop! Agatha, stop! - Leave me alone, you pest! - She's escaping, Gavin. - I think you should come back down, over. - Wait! Gavin, tunnel! - Klara, Klara, Klara! - I'm here, Gevin. - Thank goodness, Klara, thank goodness. - I can't see her. - Ooh. Ugh. Ugh, ugh. Could use some fresh air. - Ugh. - Talk about having an out-of-body experience. - It was Agatha. - Agatha? - What are you talking about? - Agatha's a thief. The seed is in her purse. - Are your, are you certain? - Yes, we must prove it's her. The police are waiting to arrest dad at the station for a crime he did not commit. - But where can? - Oh! - Excuse me. - Do you have a cold? I think I have a herbal remedy in my co, co, compartment. - Gavin, have you forgotten to take your pill again? - I try not to bother anyone with my sneezing. - Ah, he's so allergic to small, furry mammals. I mean, it's like... - Like rabbits. - Sure, them too. - Of course, he's very allergic to Agatha. - Huh? - Gavin, you sneeze away and let your allergy lead us to Agatha. - Oh. - Gavin, let those sneezes out. - When do I receive the money? What more information does the insurance company need? - Good job, Gavin. Hang in there. - What more do they need to know? They've stole my seed! - No. Agatha stole your seed. - Agatha? - Yes, but we're on her trail. Gavin is sneezing her out. - That little rat. - Oh, that was lovely. - Hang in there Gavin. Well done. - That felt nice. That was a good one. - Gavin, stop snotting on the floor now. - Good job, Gavin. - Oh, can someone take over? - Metana, please open the safety door. - No. - No? Do as I tell you. - Metana? It must be Agatha. She's done something to Metana. Please, you must stop her before she destroys everything. - Whoa. - Help me up there. - In the meantime, can someone release Dad? That prison cell is reserved for a certain rabbit. - That tickles, that tickles. - Agatha, stop! - Ow, ow. - Take that! No. - that tickles. - I can't stop. - Ow, ow. - No, I have to ruin everything for Albert, the way he ruined everything for us. He robbed us off everything. - Ow. Ouch! A biff! A Biff. A hello. Time to let you out. Sorry. It was just a misunderstanding. - I'd expect nothing less from you, Bart. - Ah, thanks, Biff. Apparently Agatha stole the seed. Would you believe it? - Klara, she solved the case. That's my girl. I sure hope that's the key. - I don't know where I put the key. - Huh, what? - What do we do? What happened? - Bye bye, Albert. - Metana! Metana. - Wait for me, Biff! - Klara! - This is about Rabbit Woods, isn't it? What terrible thing did Albert do at Rabbit Woods to make you want to steal the seed? Agatha? I know this is not who you are. You are no thief. - No. The seed destroyed the soil at Rabbit Woods. We loved our soil. We nurtured it as best we could. The problem was that there wasn't enough of it. You see, we rabbits have quite a few children. To put it mildly. At our farm in Rabbit Woods, we eventually had too many mouths to feed. We were growing desperate when he suddenly showed up. Albert, the swine with all the answers. For a short while it looked promising. Wonderful in fact. Then everything died. Albert, the man responsible for everything had long since run off with his pigtail between his legs. To make matters even worse, he kept doing it. Rabbit Woods was just the first farm he destroyed. Not even a carrot would grow in Rabbit Woods since he was there. And ever since I've been plotting my revenge. You must never let Albert plant that seed on Cattle Hill. Look me in the eye and promise me that, Klara! Cattle Hill must not suffer the same fate as Rabbit Woods. - We've got to stop this train! - But how? We've tried all the buttons. - The tanks. - What, the tanks? - Exactly, the methane tanks. - The methane tanks. - Oh! - Come on. - Well, well, I'm , I'm looking forward to arresting someone again. - It's not working, the train isn't stopping. Agatha! - Up here, Klara. Listen, we have to get off before we run out tracks. - What should we do? - We have to jump. We have no other choice. Klara, trust me. - Oh, hold on to your hats! - Agatha? Agatha? - Klara. Here's the seed, Klara, you take it. I hope and think you'll do the right thing. It has been our real pleasure meeting you. And remember, the world will always have a need for our good detective. Okay. Until we meet again, my friend. Good luck and goodbye. - Agatha? Agatha? - Klara. - Dad? - Klara. - Oh, I was so scared. So very scared. Oh, thank goodness. - Did you get the seed? Where's Agatha? - She simply disappeared. - Months of hard work gone to waste. Years as a matter of fact. I must return to the laboratory and start all over. - Matana? - Walk to towards the light. Don't be afraid. My work here is done. - No! No, my masterpiece. - Back to Twinder. This time I go for muscles. Oh! - Did you get the seed? - Hm. - Huh, well, then just who am I supposed to arrest here? - Don't blame the inventor. It was, my assistants. - I've never arrested robots before, but there's a first time for everything. Crap. Come back here. - Well, well, Klara, to think your father would end up like this. Working with computers. I've never really understood these things. What if this is my last year here at Cattle Hill? - Are we there yet? Klara! Klara! Klara, quickly, Klara, you have to see this! - While we were away, wonderful things had happened at Cattle Hill all on their own. - Let me see. Yes. - Are you trying to tell me that this horrible journey was just a waste of time? - No, no, no. Because guess what, Bart? This rather unpleasant, unfortunate train ride might actually have saved our beloved Cattle Hill. Because sometimes the best the farmer can do is give the soil a moment's rest. - Dad was right, for once. The Cattle Hill soil never needed Super Seeds, robots, nor nanotechnology. It just needed a rest, which it finally had been given. And in no time, plants were again sprouting and growing all over Cattle Hill. - Big smile. - Who knows if Chickolina's rain dance made a difference to the soil? But what it did do was teach Pauline to finally kick back a little. And Albert taught dad that things could be done a little differently to how they always have. A little manure is needed. Fortunately, Gavin and Bart are the world's best muck spreaders. Well, Bart definitely is. And it never hurts to put a lot of love into what you do, which isn't a problem when you love what you do and you have the world's best crew to work with. An adventurous detective's life is all well and good at times. But I, I don't think I will ever be being a farmer. - I'm only joking.
