In the early sixties, a group of Germans arrived in Chile with the intention of founding a place that many baptized as the German miracle of southern Chile. 1989. In the last months of the dictatorship. A PLACE CALLED DIGNITY Where's my mom? I've already sent her a message, to the mountain. she must be on her way. How are you feeling? I got four stitches. Let me see! How brave! And crazy... what were you thinking climbing up that huge tree? It doesn't even hurt. Listen... They sing so weird. I wanted to talk to you about that. The german uncles are gonna set up a special school for Chilean kids. With P.E., music, they're gonna teach to play instruments... Gym class... but like Olympic gymnastics. And you sing so pretty, Can you imagine? you'd get selected for the choir immediately There's a river, you can swim... Watch TV... I'll tell you a little secret... Not a hair of our heads moves... unless it's God's will. Ma'am, how'd the x-ray go? Good. Dignity charitable institution. To work is to serve God. To work is to serve God. Stop, we need to correct something. There, perfect. Pastor, please come in. Excuse me. How are you, Mr Paul? Pablito. Hello. How's your head? Doesn't even hurt. Strong bones. Rudolf, switch places. There, perfect. Four...three... Thank you Uncle Paul, we will be here early tomorrow with Pablo's mother. So you like to sing. Pablito? They call him "Parral's sparrow". The church gets crowded when he sings. What kind of car is this? Mercedes Benz. Brought straight from Germany! I got up at six in the morning, after the first crow of the rooster. I started by cleaning the children's rooms. One of them was dustier than usual. When I looked closer, I realized one of the windows wasn't completely closed. That was my fault. Is that all? I had a dream last night... Good or bad? I don't know, Pius. The nursery... It was shining with sunlight. I was cleaning up, like every morning. Suddenly, I heard a noise... Inside the nursery... As if someone was crying... Very softly... I walked to one of the cribs... But when I looked... There was nothing ... Suddenly... I felt... A strong piercing pain in the stomach... The dream means you haven't been chosen to be a mother yet. Keep yourselves strong and immovible, always moving forward in God's labor, knowing that your work for him isn't in vain. Subdue to God and resist the devil, so he will run away from you. To work is to serve God. To work is to serve God. Where are they? Pablo! How did you get up there? What were you thinking? And where did you get that one from? Uncle Paul gave it to me... Look, it says "made in the U.S.A". I'm going to sing in the choir. -Really? -Yes. Let's see... because you haven't behaved very well. But the pastor told me I could. But the pastor is not your mother. But he takes care of me. Well then, I'll ask my dad when he comes. Your dad... If you don't kick him out again. Why do you look at me like that? It was your fault. You're going to regret all this you're saying. You're going to feel bad later. Do you know why? For badly grateful. What do you want me to be thankful for? I didn't choose to have a poor mother. -Welcome. -Thank you. How young are you... So... You spend much time in the mountains. Yes, I'm a temporary field worker. And there's not always work to do, it's hard, so I have to stay there many times. As you know... We're opening a children's institute. Here he could study music, Gym and the word of God. Yeah, sister Cecilia, remember that... idleness is the mother of all sin. We know it's hard... Working and... being away from your son. Yes. Everything's harder when one's alone. But the pastor is a saint. He cares for Pablo, takes him to church, makes him share with other kids. But the pastor cannot care for so many kids. We want Pablo to be out first scholarship recipient. A scholarship? Yes, sister Cecilia, free studies. I don't know what to say. I'm getting goosebumps even. Trust us. You and your son deserve this chance. Say yes, remember, you don't look at a gift horse in the mouth. A scholarship? Come on, say something. You wanna stay? I'm sorry. I forgive you even before you do things, Pablo. You wanna stay? You sure? Promise me you'll behave. "I promise, mom". I promise, mom. "I promise, mommy dear" I promise, mommy dear. Alright, thank you. Now I know why you like the cap. Because it matches your pretty eyes. And that TV? Some TV you got. And I'm gonna learn to play that piano. Yeah? Hey, when you come back you gotta bring me my fast sneakers. Pablo, they're so old! Bring them anyway. Alright, I will. Are you gonna be okay? A pianist? I'm sorry. Careful, the milk's hot. Thanks. This is like one of those museums they show on TV. Why so? Everything's old. Things well donne, don't need to be replaced. So, the church fills up when you sing. Sometimes. Do you like singing church songs? Not so much, they're kinda boring, always the same ones. Which ones do you like? I don't think you've heard them. Show me, let's hear. Or are you shy? A friend in church has a cassette radio, he recorded it. Though I still don't know it very well. It's just another night... of walking by... another end of month... with nothing new. My friends stayed behind... just like you... This year they ran out... of games, the twelve games. Join the dance, of the leftovers. No one will miss us no more, No one really wanted to help us before. Hey, I know some stories, about the future. Hey, back when I heard them first, times were safer. Here. If you get cold you can grab another one. How old are you? Twelve. You have pretty eyes. Hi. Hey, I said "hi". -What's your name? -I'm Pablo We can't talk here. Why are you talking like that? God doesn't like secrets, and neither does Pius. Who's Pius? Permanent uncle. If he's not here, how will he know we're talking? Who's there? What are you doing here? Releasing the dogs. What? I like to see the dogs run, they go nuts. You're the Chilean kid from the choir? I play the piano. You know Rudolph? You know where he is? He's a "Sprinter", he can sleep at the Freihaus. Sprinter? What's that? Pius's helper. Are you a Sprinter? Only men can be. Come, come. If you're a Sprinter, you can watch TV. Rudolph is the best. If you see the dogs, bite your tongue. The dream means I haven't yet been chosen to be a mother. Not yet? God and Pius know... That we talk in secret... They see us. This is my fault. No. It's my fault. The devil... has entered me. Pius told me. Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Leave me, Satan... Who did you see leaving the woodshop? Go and sit down. Gisela, come here. What were you doing with Johannes in the woodshop? Something we're not worthy of hearing? It's my fault. Gisela, we're waiting. There are no secrets here! How can I trust you? You know what you have to do. Pius... Please. Do it, now! Take him away! All the boys are working at the cornfield. All the boys are working at the cornfield. To work is to serve God Hey, Rudolph. Hey, Rudolph! Come on! Rudolph! You're so lucky, you can watch TV every day. We can only watch on the weekends, and only if the pastor's in a good mood. I don't like to watch TV. Come on, how can you not like it? Hey, what's it like outside? -Outside where? -The other side of the gate. You've never been to town? No. The town's different from here, there are many streets, shops, traffic lights, many things. Tra... traffic light? What's that? Don't tell me you don't know what a traffic light is. Look... come, come. Look... Each circle is a light bulb, a colored light. One's red, the middle one's yellow, the bottom one's green. So the traffic lights go in every corner. When a car is driving on the street, and the light goes red, it has to stop. So on the other street the light goes green and they can go. That way they can cross and not crash, get it? "get it?" You talk weird... It means if you understand or not. You gotta go someday when Los Prisioneros go sing. Who? Los Prisioneros! Hey, don't do that! God's watching! Come on, don't overreact. I bet you're also about to pee yourself. Did you release the dogs? No. She's lying. She's lying. I'm not lying, Pius. Tell me what you did today. I got up at 5:00 a.m. At 6:30 I was at the bakery. As always. Then I worked all morning with aunt Eva. She asked me to make the dough for the morning bread. Then I cleaned up everything. The furniture and the floor. We ate at the dining room, then we went back to work at the bakery. At sundown... Aunt Eva came to me and told me I smelled. She turned me around and saidmy skirt was stained. I told her I hadn't had time to do my laundry. She got mad... She told me that as punishment I'd have to work late. I went back to the girls' house. And I waited for everyone to go to bed. I took my clothes and took them to the laundry room. I can smell the devil. Play. Play. Yes... that's it. I can hear the Devil... Don't stop playing! Please! Please let me go! What happened to her? Don't talk, if the uncles hear you they'll come. But what happened to her? She wears a white sweater, she's sick. She does things without thinking. Everyone begin your working day. Everyone begin your working day. Everyone begin your working day. Everyone begin your working day. To work is to serve God and to keep the devil away. To work is to serve God and to keep the devil away. What does "Sprinter" mean? Where did you hear that word? I heard it from someone. "Sprinter" is an English word, It means racer, someone fast and intrepid. Ah, so I can be a Sprinter. You have to watch and remember what you see. Looks like we have one here. Here. He doesn't know we're watching him. Steady against the shoulder! Where's the best place to shoot him? The head. The offspring or babies are gestated through the sexual act or intercourse. Intercourse: Sexual union between male and female adult animals. Normally through sperm transfer... from the first to the latter... through the copulatory organ. Johannes, come. You have to do the same. Young kids. Tomorrow is a very special day. We're receiving very important guests. That's why I need help from the best. Today I will pick the Sprinters, that will accompany me tomorrow. Did you understand? On your marks... Get set... Go! He can't be a sprinter! Look at him! He is Chilean. But, he won the race! What's he saying? That you can't be a Sprinter because you're black, like Johannes. Who are you calling black, asshole? I beat you anyway! You, go to the children's house. Pablo. Pablo! Tomorrow will be your first day as Sprinter. Right there. Something's missing... "Chilean Authorities" "German Embassy" Does it hurt? -Wait here. -Ok. Can you tell me your name, please? María Eugenia Corral. And yours? Marta Chacón Silva. Alright, wait here and we'll treat you. Miss, excuse me... Do you know Gloria Chacón Silva? Gloria Chacón Silva? Excuse me... You know?... I've lived in this town since I was born. And... I've seen things that people in Santiago don't know about. Things that the police and politicians say don't exist. You asked my name kindly. I was wondering if my sister was asked about her name in the same way. The pastor in town says they help us here, that without the germans we wouldn't even have aspirin. But I cannot look the other way anymore. My sister was brought here and they put her in a stretcher just like that one. But they didn't put her there to help her... In this place people are tortured. People go missing! Gloria Chacón Silva, countrywoman, union leader! Detained on March 14th, 1974! Miss! Tortured and disappeared here, in Colonia Dignidad! -Calm down. -Let me go! Gloria Chacón Silva, countrywoman, union leader! Detained on March 14th, 1974! Detained, tortured and disappeared! Here in Colonia Dignidad! You trust these people, but I think it's shameful! Let go of me! Miss, look at me. Look at me, look, my sister was thirty-five years old. Thirty-five years old... Help me find out where she is, please. Thank you all for your presence. I'm sorry. I'm a bit nervous. We're very happy, More so when we're so close to celebrating our Lord's birth, to receive this visit. As you know, Your support has been of great importance, To face the events that have recently been affecting us. Hard times are coming. There are people that attack those who for years have been helping, and working without asking anything in return. However... God has placed good people along the road. And as a sign of gratitude, we have prepared a gift. This is a movie where you'll see what you've helped us protect. I'd like to invite one of the most important people of this country, someone who has been a huge and constant support to our cause. Please, Chile's First Lady. I'm very excited, and how could I not be proud of this significant cause which has benefited so many compatriots in these distant lands. Sometimes we forget that many people work in the shadows, anonymously, without asking for anything in return. And that is the true spirit of this place. The country is going through hard yet natural times. And I know that there are many people, like those of us here, who can see and understand what this country has become. The eyes, the eyes of this boy... Pablo. Pablo... ...His eyes, his smile, his talent... are the clearest proof that if we do things right, we can expect much more from all of us. And that's what we hope for this country. I want to ask for a round of applause, not just for this new and renovated Villa Baviera, but also for Pablo, The first of many kids to fill us with joy, and pride like these good colonists, who have made a true German miracle in the south of Chile. Wonderful apple. Delicious. Mr. Paul, let me tell you... I see your work... Order, cleanliness, labor. Chile should be like that. Take him by the legs. "Where are they?" We had never seen this kind of things around here. Don't worry Mr. Paul. Nothing is going to happen. Never. We'll win! Can you stay till tomorrow? New stags came in, one loses his good aim without practice. I'd love to, thank you, but things are complicated in Santiago. Here too. If the Shepherd leaves... The herd gets lost. Yes, but my General isn't going anywhere, Mr.Paul. He'll be watching, observing, from... another hill, that's all. Rudolph! Pablo ! Where are you? Come here! Look at you, such a gallant! Ready to sing on TV. You sang beautifully yesterday at the presentation. But... I'm sad. Is there something you want to tell me? Something bad... that you've done? A little bird told me you like to take walks outside at night. Did you follow Rudolph? Does it bother you... that he watches TV and you don't? You think I love him more than I love you? Aren't you going to say anything? I'll have to call the pastor. If you don't follow the rules, you'll have to leave. Why? I haven't done anything. Secrets and envy are severe symptoms. Or do you want to be like your dad? A bum? delinquent? Where will you live? You'll be taken to a orphanage with kids who've robbed and killed. Don't tell the pastor. I do all this because I love you. This is our child. Our child. -What happened? -You'll have to help me. Bring her! Bring her! Come, come! Bring her here! She crashed into the rocks! We must take her to the hospital! What happened?! She tried to cross the river! Raise her head! Beware her back. Pablo, help us! Hold her steady. Let's get her up, carefully. How is she? Disobedience is a severe illness. It makes us do things we don't want to do. So you want to be like animals. And you steal a child from the hospital. Then you'll sin like animals. Take off your clothes. Please, Pius... Please, Pius. Take off your clothes. Turn around and face each other. I had the same dream last night. A bright light shone in the nursery. I heard a noise from one of the rooms. I walked to one of the cribs... I looked in... There was our child. You'll never have a child. Nobody who's sinned that way, is worthy of a child. God has decided so. Boys and girls go to the main hall. Boys and girls go to the main hall. What's going on? Where're we going? For the presents, tonight is the night of presents. It's Christmas. We're all waiting for the same thing. Right? There he is... Santa Claus! Let's see what surprises he's brought. It's the Krampus! The Christmas demon! Nothing to fear! Nothing to fear... You have a clean conscience... Maybe someone who likes to sneak out at night. Santa Claus is dead. Apparently, there are no children here. Although they still wet their pants! What will I do with you? Distance... Go! Next! Hey! Apologize. Why? He got in the way! A Sprinter must be obedient. I don't wanna be a Sprinter. Ah... is that so. Come closer, come! Rudolph, you too. Pablo is very sad lately. So we'll make him laugh a bit. You too, come on. Get off me! Tickles! Make him laugh! Make him laugh! Get off me! Enough, leave. Your attitude disappoints me. But your mom will be more disappointed. I'll give you a chance to make it right. Do you think you deserve it? Then think about it. Pablo, It's for you. Thank you. It comes from the United States. From now on, you can come every night and watch T.V. Why did you put that on? You mustn't be ashamed. Take it off. Embarrassment doesn't exist in this room. Take it off! Do you know why they call me Dauer Onkel? It means permanent uncle. Because I will be there with you forever, even after dying. Did you sleep at the Freihaus? Did you watch TV? A little. You're an adult too now. I don't like it. But... Dauer Onkel says... that when you're an adult you can go to heaven. I didn't want to tickle you the other day. Doesn't matter. I'm getting out of here. You'll get caught. I can cross the river. You'll die. You should go too. God tells Pius everything. I don't care. I don't believe in God. I know you're up. I can't sleep either. I won't be a Sprinter anymore. I'm leaving. Rest. Let me go, fucking Germans! His symptoms advanced quickly. It all started with a decayed mood, then nightmares, recurrent dreams that led to delirium and deep confusion. We tried all possible treatments, but this disease was too strong. Miss, I wanna see my son. The illness gave him strong hallucinations... Your son had an accident in the river. Miss, I wanna see my son, now. -Where is he? -Stay calm... Come with me, please. Mom... Mom. Mom. Mom! Mom... Mom! I'm here mom! I'm here mom... Mom! Listen to me. Mom! Mom! Listen to me please! Mom! Let him! Mom! Mom! Mom! Pius! They are running away! Where are they? We can't see them, they escaped to the river. Rudolph! Rudolph! Dignity Colony continued its operation under Paul Schäfer's control even after the return to democracy in 1990. His command was perpetuated until his death in 2010.
