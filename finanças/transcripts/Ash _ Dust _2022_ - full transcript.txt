You can't outrun fate. Breakfast. Good morning. I'll give you three, 325. I could go as high as 350. Yes. Just had a man through here. Had himself a coin to appraise. So? An ancient coin. Hey, you want some? Hey, what's up, Uncle Nick? - What's up little, man. - I need some work, - You know what we do, right? - Yeah, I know what you do. You just don't get it do you? This could all be over. All you have to do is tell us who ratted on us. You know what, you might not know anything, but I can't tell you how good it makes me feel taken out some of this frustration on you. I don't know anything. I can't say it any more plain than that. We can do this all night. I'm not sure you can, but we can. All right, stop. Stop. Okay, it wasn't me. I would never cross you or your dad. I think it was Nick. It had to be. Me? You're saying it was me. I suppose you'd say just about anything right now. Well, lying or unaware, you are definitely useless. Okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah? I've got something for you and your boys to take care of. Well, Dr. Carr, it's been quite an afternoon. I can truly say I've never enjoyed myself so much. I'll recommend you to all my friends. Thank you, goodbye. Goodbye now. Feed me. Take it easy, Dracula. What do you think I'm carrying here? Hello? All right, little man, I got something for tomorrow. You're gonna need this. Put your goddamn mask on. All right, out of the trunk, big man. Move! Move. That's it. All right, turn around. Turn the fuck around. Start walking. Go. Just tell us where it is and nothing bad happens. Last chance. Last chance! Shit. Hello? Where is it? I'll be there in 20 minutes. Stop. Last chance. Joel, shoot this fucking idiot. Shoot him. Hey, hey. In for a penny, in for a pound, Joel. Shoot him. He's a dead man anyway, so just shoot it. This is how this works, okay. Shoot him, shoot him! I'm going to count to three. If you don't shoot him, I'm going to shoot you, then I'm going to shoot him. One, two, three. I don't get why we have to do this. Because we offered him a choice and this is what you chose. Joel. Just a second. Come here! Get off me. Yeah? The cops are at the stash house. Why? I don't know yet. Come see me when you do. What did you do with the man who had my box? What difference does it make? What did you do? What I always do. Took him out in the woods, popped him in the head. He's a dead man. Oh, is he? You are one tough bitch. I'll give it to ya. It's pretty impressive. Ultimately it's very, very necessary. All you have to do is tell us where the fuck it is and then we'll go. And that's an offer I made to your man too. You know what he did? He refused, which is rude. I suggest that knowing what we did to him, you don't do the same. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know. No. No, no. It's gotta be around here somewhere. Jackpot. Lindsey! Lindsey! Lindsey! Best guess is that the bullet is lodged along the side here. Pretty much between your frontal and temporal lobes. There's a very slim chance it won't kill you, but it's beyond my abilities. Then sew it up. And give me painkillers. The new only ones I've got here are for horses. Sounds about right. Joel, who is that? Don't worry about it. What's up? Your uncle's dead. I'm coming to get you. Bit cold out today. Where we going? My dad knows how to find Wade. You're gonna do it this time. Hey, hey. In for a penny in for a pound. Joel. Shoot him. He's a dead man anyway, so just shoot him. This is how this works, okay. Shoot him, shoot him. I'm going to count to three. If you don't shoot him, I'm going to shoot you then I'm going to shoot him. One, two, three. Dad! I'm sorry. I didn't kill your wife. I stayed out of it. But I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I'm sorry. Hello? You wanna see your husband again, write this down. No, no, no, no. There's one bullet in that. Pick it up, point it at his head and pull the trigger. He's already dead. Whether or not you and your baby die too is up to you. If you don't shoot, I'll shoot him and then I'll shoot you. I'm gonna count to three. One, two, three! Joel.
