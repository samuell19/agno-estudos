Wait right here. She's getting away. She's getting away. Vamonos. Seat belts. Huh, right. Baby, we did it. I told you. OK. You snore, dude. And you don't? Don't let him kid you, Brian. He could set off a car alarm. Oh. I got chilly during the night. That's what I'm here for... wife, remember? OK. I finally got you out of the office. Good morning. Good morning. I forget. Where are the restrooms? Mm. Ours is over there. And ours are over here. What the hell is this? It's a tracking device, in case we need a plan b. We don't need your stupid plan b. My plan a worked fine. I said, in case. And I heard you. Hey kids, zip it. You better not have messed anything up with your stupid tracker. These things are worth more than your life. I put the trackers on the cases, not the devices. I'm not that stupid. I'm not too sure. You know, why the hell did you have to track this? This wasn't your job to do this. Where are we... Don't move. Hands up. What are you doing? Put this helicopter down. I said, put it down. No place to land. What the frick are you doing? Thor, get rid of him. We are screwed! No. If he put chips on those cases, we can find them. You heard the lady. Put her down. Ugh! What? There are bugs everywhere out here. OK, miss I'm going camping. It was Brian's idea. Whose idea was it for you to drag your big sister along? It's just that I don't know him very well, and an entire weekend of camping. Now I get it. It has the potential to be a nuclear disaster. Hey, thanks again for being here. Of course, happy to. So how is it so far? So far, OK. I think he's a little gun shy. He'll come around. And when he does, if he makes you feel at all uncomfortable, I want you to be safe. You got me a rape whistle? It's a trouble whistle. Whatever. What's wrong with a whistle? What's this thing he's making us do? Geo camping. I don't know. I don't know either, but I think it will be good for Mike. He's been getting a little soft, working too much. Not... Not the same? Just wish he'd put a little more oomph into life. You know there are two people in a relationship. What's that supposed to mean? How many years have you been married? Seven. And how many nights do you wear sweatpants to bed? Seven. And how many nights do they stay on? Do not say seven. 6.7. Here, you need them more than me. Where the hell are we? Why did you let him do that? Because he had a freaking gun at my head. Take that, figure it out as we go. Go? I am not dressed to go anywhere in the woods. And I am not dressed to listen to your bitching. The sooner we find those cases, the sooner we're out of here. About how far back did they fall out? A mile and half, two miles. One mile... that's about... that's about 20 minutes. Two miles round trip... no, less than an hour and a half. OK. We should be out of here in three hours, tops. Three hours? Just shut up. OK. Let's find these things. Geocache. C-A-C-H-E, like a data cache or a proxy cache. Just try it. You'll see, it's really fun. We're clean. Good morning. Good morning. Here, I'll take that. Thank you. Thank you. OK. So the plan is geo... Caching. Geocaching. This is a GPS unit and a tracking device. So we start by plugging in... Thank you. You're welcome. We start by plugging in the coordinates of where my fellow geocachers have cached their cash. And then we find the coordinates and dig up a treasure. Ooh, treasure. All right. Well, let's do it. Let's go. How far? Two miles. Let's go. Can't catch me. Yes, I can. Watch out for the Toxicodendron radicans. What's that? Poison ivy. So you're an engineer? Yeah. Yeah, I uh... I wonder which way they went? Hello? Mike? Tori? Well, I guess somebody wanted to be alone. Over here. I think they went that way. I bet I can do this. Do what? Mike, no. Tori? Over here. I used to handle this easily. Old Mike, yeah, piece of cake. New, high cholesterol Mike... come on. I'm out of cell range and I don't how to send 911 smoke signals. Ah! Oh, god. Oh. Happy? Oh, oh, oh. Ah, it's the shoes. I should have taken them off. It's not broken. How's it feel? - Uh... it's good. I'm fine. You should probably ice it. Thank you, Brian. When we were in Baghdad, it was a great gun. You could really saturate a target. But like when we were sent to Kandahar, we were kind of short because the... the range is only about 600 yards. What are you doing? I just killed a dandelion. Like I said, anyway, now if you're out in the mountains with an M4, your f'd because it only... it only has like a range of... This is it. We're here. This is what? We're where? At the coordinates. The cache is around here somewhere. We just have to find it. OK. This should be fun. - Right. We can do this. Think. Where would you bury something around here. Upside down v. Teepee of branches. Oh, y in the ground. Balance beam. No, no, no. Let me show you how it's done. It's got to be here. Yeah, here. Hey, guys? Looking for this? Where did you find that? Well, I had my own coordinates. Well, I guess that's it then. Who's a geo digger? We are. Yeah. Let's open it. Oh, yeah. All right. What did we win? Awesome? Is there an instruction manual? I don't know. Huh. Well, that's weird. What? It's proper geocaching etiquette to leave your name and where you're from, but there's nothing. Well, maybe it's the bubble wrap we're supposed to find. Well, I like it and we didn't even have to dig. Now what? Now we replace the cache with something of our own. Where'd you get that? Last time I went caching. Oh. We should all buy dolphin-safe tuna. Look, you got little... Oh, look what I found. These are so cool. I just got them. They're transmitters that periodically upload their coordinates to my NAS server, back at home. It works kind of like the tracking technology in cell phones now. Everybody needs a hobby. Best part... I can give custom news to my devices and tell it how often to upload data, or I can just track it, if I'm close by. So you can track your tuna button's trip around the world. Oh, My nerd is showing, isn't it? Well, I think it's amazing. Me, too. Thanks. All right, could you hook that on the back? Yes. What are you doing? Proper etiquette. All right. Thank you. Mm-hmm. All right. I will take this back where I found it and we're all done. It's weird that it was in a duffel bag. Oh, well, maybe we'll have better luck with the next one. Next one? Oh, we've got a long day ahead of us. These caches are not going to find themselves. Nope. Here, let me help. Oh, thank you. Hey, whoa, wait. Slow poke can't catch me. But when were sent to Kandahar, I don't know, it was like sometime in June or, uh... I don't know, maybe... maybe July, the just didn't have the range we needed. Blah, blah, blah. How much further? We're about... hmm? Uh... it could be another... I don't know. It's, uh... Another 12 minutes. Yeah. How much farther? About a mile. You two don't need us. We're heading back to camp to ice Mike's ankle. I'm OK with that. Do you know where you're going? Oh. We'll see you there. Take your time. No hurry. Well, it's right here. Where? That's my boy. Yes, yes, yes. Is this some kind of sick joke? What the hell is this? Gosh damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I did not come all the way to... to heart dolphin-safe tuna. Brian and Jenny, Mike and Victoria. Well, where's the other one? They must have separated during the fall. Yeah. Let me see that. You never noticed that there's, um... two separate dots. Well, I don't have my glasses with me. Un-frickin-believable. Now we have to go look for the Brady Bunch. They went that way. This way? Let's go. I just don't know what you were thinking, I don't know. You, um... you got me excited. What did you roll in? What? Why don't you change your clothes. I'll get some ice. You don't like it dirty? Oh. Burn this. I'm going to kill somebody. Can we rest yet? Thank you. What's up? Let's go say hello. Oh, come on. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? What's going on, guys? Is somebody lost? We're just passing by. You guys here by yourselves? Yeah. Camping. - I'm going to go get a bandage. - A bandage? Did you... did you hurt yourself? No biggie, just twisted my ankle. How long you here for? Actually, we were just getting ready to pack up. Our ride will be here in an hour or two. Seen anyone else in the woods? No. What do you think you're doing? Anything? No. Score. Ugh. Water. Hey. Sweetie, no. You know anyone named Brian or Mike? Everybody knows somebody named Mike or Brian. They're pretty common names. So why do you have two tents? We're not married. Then what are the rings for? Are you in the circus? Enough with the games. What do you people want? I think you know exactly what we want. Don't you? Let's just take it easy. OK? Small device in a case in a bag. Where is it? OK. We didn't know it was yours. We thought it was part of a game. Freaking game. I buried it. Well, that wasn't so hard, was it? Wait. You buried it, like a dog? Thor, shut up. Who cares why he buried it. Boy Scouts do stupid crap like that. Find the other one. Fido, here, is going to take us to his hiding place. Tina, take that girl and meet us back at the helicopter. No. Wait. No. Oh, Mike... Mike? Hey, look at that, she knows somebody named Mike. Now that we're all acquainted, let's go find something really expensive, huh? Hey. Hey, easy. You get your toy back when I get my toy back. Hey. Hey. Knock this stuff off right now. I want to see her alive back at the helicopter. Got it? Mike? I'll get them what they want. We'll be fine. We're not worth their trouble. Let's hope not. Move it. Faster. Now that's more like it. We find the cache. There's proper documentation. And we put something back. Go ahead, open it. OK. May I? Yeah. It was upside down. Oh. Me and pretty Jenny, we're a geocaching. Sitting by the elderberry, ain't she smashing? You may think you're a pretty good at geocaching, but you can't cache me. At 600, 700, 800 yards, can't hit with a 223 round. You need something of a heavy caliber, something that can hit a major artery in the thigh or even the bicep, and sever that, and bleed out... How much farther? M1-10. Wait. I want to hear the rest of this. Thor? Don't get cute with me. You're not my freaking type. Now go find the frickin' thing. Anyway, the M1-10 rifle, they're going to send it to Afghanistan. Faster. Bear left. Shut up, bitch. Found me. What do I get? Hey, Fido, where is this place? It's right up there, real close. You know what, Mikey? I don't believe you. I think you're leading us in circles. No. Why would I do that? Ah, I don't know. Maybe because you care more about your fluffy friend than you do you little wifey. I told you, it's right up there. I think he's bluffing. And I call. Make sure you double tap. It's nine mil. I always frickin' double tap. Did you hear that? Son of a bitch. Ah. Are there hunters out here? I don't know. I don't think so. You have an interesting life. Can't argue that. Where did you meet? That's your boyfriend, right? Thirsty? Too bad. Let's go. Move it. Rifles don't sound like that. Maybe we should go back to camp. OK. Come on. Did you hear that? Yeah... more gunshots. It's all right. We'll be OK. Come on. Brian? We'll be OK. Come on. What's that? Oh, OK. Let's go. Frick. Damn it. Hey. You know, you're not that pretty. Your husband is no prize either. You hear me? Don't point a gun at me. Who brings a gun camping, really? Jeez. What's going on? - They took Tori. - What? Who? Three guys and a woman dressed in suits. They want that thing we found. They took Tori so I'd help them find it. Well, what's with the shooting? I killed one. Mike? One's still around somewhere. The third is looking for a second box. The woman has Victoria. Mike, you don't look so good. There's another dead body over there. It was a guy in a suit. It looked like he fell out of a plane. A chopper. That's where they're taking her. What's going to happen to her? Nothing. We're going to find that thing and get her back. Do you still have it? We cached it, under a log. What? I know where it is. I can go get it. I'm sorry. OK. OK. You find the thing. You get to the road and go for help. OK. - I'll go find Tori... - No, no, no. Hold on. Let's analyze this. You said there was another guy looking for the second box. Yeah? We should stay together, work as a team. No, no. I need... I need you to find that thing. OK? We're wasting time. Well, how many more guns are out there? I don't know. Look... look, we're wasting time. Just do what I say. I need to find Tori. Just wait. Hold on. Just a second. The chopper... it's moved to the camp site. That's where I'll be. Brian? Hey, it's going to be OK. All right? She's going to be fine. - Which way for help? - Oh, no, no, no. You're not leaving my sight. Brian, you heard Mike. She needs me. I go five or 10 miles, I will come to road. I will find help. Five or ten miles? That's a long way. I can do this. I ran that 10K, remember? Which way? Which way? - That way. - OK. OK. Hold on. Let me make sure... I'll be keeping tabs on you. OK. Find that stupid thing. Be careful. Go. Frick. Where you going, huh? Huh? You think everything is a frickin' game, don't you? Where's my? No. Oh. Buffy and Bunny. What the hell is this? I don't know. It... it's computerriffic. I think it's a hard drive. How would you know what a hard drive looks like? I don't know. That's what a hard drive looks like. What are these laser things? - I hope nobody wanted this. - Uh... Oh, well. Hey. You keep half and I keep half. Ooh. Yeah. Commemorate our wood trek. The bugs are really getting to me. Watch out for the wildlife. It'll get you. That's creepy. Hey. Oh, hey, do you think there's deer out here? Sit. Is this the first time you've ever been geocaching? Yeah, actually. That's what we must have heard earlier, the hunters shooting the deer. It's not open season. It must've been like firecrackers or something. Firecrackers in the woods. Well, maybe. Hi... hi. Have you heard gunshots? Sounds like they're dropping like flies out there. Well, well, well, what do we have here? Are you a cop? Are you going to kill me? I know where that thing is. You mean, Brian has it. Who's Brian? You ever see those movies about killing sprees? I always wanted to do that. You know, see America, have some fun. Help me. Here. It's OK. You're going to be OK. You're going to be OK. Come on, Jenny. The road's nowhere near here. Jenny? Jenny? Jenny? Jenny. Jenny? Who did this? I don't where he is, but he's coming back. - Stay still. - No, run, Brian. Brian! Don't move. I mean it. Brian, run. Stop. Leave him alone. Stop it. Stop. Brian! Brian? Brian? You need to run. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Ah. No. Stop. No. No. Stop it. No. No. Where is it? Where is the device? Stop it. Let's see if Jenny knows something, huh? No. Jenny, run! - Leave him alone. - Jenny, run. Jenny? Jenny? Listen. Over there, underneath the tree is my backpack. The thing they're looking for is inside. Go get it, find Mike, and go bring it to him. What about you? Well, I think he's out, thanks to you. His gun's around here somewhere. I'll be free in a minute. Hurry. Go get it. No, I'll stay. No, no, no, we can't wait. Just go get it, OK, please? Hurry. Hurry. So you can find me. Oh. Listen. No matter what you hear, I'll be OK. It's that way. Go. Hurry up. F... five years... five freaking years I've been in this relationship. I thought I could get married, even to that prick. But that's never going to happen. You can do better than him. I mean, you're smart, obviously. What the frick do you know? Look at you. Marriage makes you soft. You and your loser husband. I'm just saying that... Get up. Time to go, bitch. Jenny. Mike. Mike. Hey. Did you find help? Got lost. Look here, it's... it's that thing. This. Mike, I think... I think Brian killed somebody. We need to find Tori. What are you doing? Just in case we need one later. Come on. I don't like guns. Me either. Do you need a rest? No. Want some water? Yeah. Here. Thank you. Jenny, it's her. That's her. That's who took Tori. I don't see Victoria. Who the hell are you? I'm Jenny. What are you doing here, Jenny? Oh, you know, "Man versus Wild's" like my favorite show, so I figured I'd get out here and really just dig in. Have a seat, Jenny. I don't have germs. That's not a water. Are you alone? Yes, I am. I am alone. Aren't we all alone, Jenny? I mean, really? You remind me of someone, someone I don't like. Where you off to, Jenny? Who the hell are you, people? We're geocachers. You, get out here or I'll shoot her. Where is my wife? She's as good as dead, and worse if she runs into Luther. You, you're just dead. Go. Go. That sucks. Go. Go. Go. Are you hit? Go. Honey. Oh, Mike. It's not bleeding that badly. Some. It's bad enough. Where's Victoria? Baby... Did you let her get away? Huh? Answer me. Did you let her get away? I didn't sign up for this. Are you drunk? This isn't exactly happy hour, Tina. Where's Jenny? Where's Brian? I don't know where Brian's at. Jenny is right behind me. Oh. Where's Thor? Thor's dead. What the hell happened to you? What do we do now? Just go. Is that one of them? Please tell me this is one of them. Where does that get us? Not enough money. If we go now, we still have three weeks paid instead of five. I'll take us to Brian. I said, it's not enough money. Oh, Jenny. I know they have know the other one. Plus, I want to kill that bastard. You go find Brian. No. I'm not leaving you. You wouldn't leave me. Stay here. This won't take long. I want to come too. Tina, I think we can mess this up without your help. You two, just go. We're all going together. Jenny, help me. Hey, Mikey, where did you go, buddy? We were just getting to know each other. What do we do? How about I just tell you what I want and we'll call this whole thing off, huh? , girls. You stabbed me. I think we're even. This is it? Isn't there anything else? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I got it. This is my rainy day bullet. Like I said, you two go. Take this. I've got an idea. Come out, come out, wherever you are. This frickin' bitches. Hey, hey. Do you like playing games, Jenny? You won't be having any fun once I find you. Jenny, it's not nice to play with other people's property. I got to admit, I like it when they run. You want to come out, Jenny? I'll tell you what. I promise, if you come on now, I'll only hurt you a little bit. Jenny. Bitch. Don't. Stop it. Ah. Tori! Mikey, where you been my whole life? Hey, Mikey, who's getting messed up now? Huh, buddy? Huh? I'll make your little wife scream, and will frickin' bury the both of you. Jenny? Jenny? Tori? Oh, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, are you OK? Are you OK? Oh. No, I'm OK. Are you OK? Oh, god. Oh, Mike. Mike. Mike. Oh, Mike, are you OK? Are you all right? It's OK. Are you OK? Is he dead? Mm-hmm. Let's go. No. Jenny. What do you want? Hey. Oh. Hey, you guys. Ah. Oh. You should put some ice on that. They're transmitters that periodically upload their coordinates to my NAS server back at home. It's kind of like the tracking technology in cell phones now. Now who's the bitch?
