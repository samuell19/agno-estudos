Hi, I'm Dr. Simmons. Ella Patel. Well, I'm grateful you're here, Ella. This is my study we're conducting, and anyone who volunteers their time is much appreciated. Thank you. Well, let me break down the next 10 days for you so that you know what to expect. First off, my background is in obstetrics and gynecology with an emphasis on the cognitive side of fertility issues. I have seen too many women like you over the years just pulling their hair out, miserable, because they don't want to have children. But after hearing their stories and knowing their medical history, I have become 100 percent convinced that this is a fixable physiological issue. The idea is simple. It is the singular evolutionary goal of a species to procreate. That is our purpose, right? - Right. - Which says to me that because you are otherwise physically healthy, your system is just a little off, chemically, mentally. No different than someone with depression. You follow? - Sure. - So the whole goal of this trial is to get you back realigned with your natural state. And what does that involve? A multi-pronged approach. We administer medication, a newly engineered synthetic hormone... - Synthetic? - A regimen of pills. The same naturally occurring hormones that already exist in your body, just formulated to up your desire for kids. And we pair that course of treatment with CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy. Sorry, how much can you really accomplish with 10 days of therapy? So we use a very targeted approach. Intense, but effective. And look, this trial is just a jumping-off point. Don't expect to leave here in 10 days with baby fever. I'm not a magician. But we can refer you to someone good after, and you can continue the work if you choose. - Hmm. - Hey. You showed up today. Hardest part is already over. Tonight, just relax and let modern medicine do the rest. Uh, did, uh, Cara show you the dining room? The food here is actually really good. Fresh. Okay then, I will see you tomorrow. Dr. Simmons. I might be a tough case. You're not a case to me, Ella. You're a human being, and the best kind, too. What kind is that? A woman. [chuckles] [door closes] ♪ Foreboding music ♪ ♪ foreboding music continues ♪ [exhales] I just don't want the responsibility. And... being constantly covered in throw-up, cleaning up shit. Like, that's your reward? That's if you even make it through the birth. DR. SIMMONS: What do you mean by that? "Make it through the birth." Like, if you make it through your pelvis separating, or the vaginal cysts. Clogged ducts, the blood, shit, pain. DR. SIMMONS: Well, there are meds for that. [scoffs] Yeah. Hard pass on a giant needle in my spine. DR. SIMMONS: You know, it's highly unlikely for a woman to die or suffer lasting side effects in childbirth these days. But why take the risk? DR. SIMMONS: Have you ever considered that you might have tokophobia? Tokophobia? A pathological fear of pregnancy. I didn't know there was a technical term for it, but... yeah, I'm terrified. And yet you chose to come here to conquer your fears. That must mean a lot to your husband. [chuckles] He doesn't know that I'm here. Oh. Interesting. Why not? Because what if it doesn't work? Now, a diagnosis is good, but it's meaningless unless we uncover why your phobia exists. What drives it. Okay. DR. SIMMONS: Don't be nervous. You're just gonna look at some cards and tell me what you see. ELLA: Like a Rorschach test? DR. SIMMONS: Similar. Some women see more than others, but the amount doesn't mean anything. Sit with them. [exhales softly] ♪ Ominous music ♪ [exhales sharply] Are you seeing this? DR. SIMMONS: Tell me what you're seeing. A very tall woman. DR. SIMMONS: Anything else? Oh. DR. SIMMONS: Yes? A pile of... A-a family of... of dead bugs. Spiders. A grandfather clock. Yeah. Anything else? Hmm. No, nothing else. What do they all mean? We will get to the bottom of that tomorrow. [pills rattling] [clock ticking] [thud] Well, I guess we should start with the easy one. Okay. Let's start with the easy one. My dad has a massive grandfather coffin in his living room. It's a very important family heirloom, our one and only. DR. SIMMONS: And why is it so important? 'Cause it's the one thing that they... Finish that sentence? Recovered from their home after the war. And who is they? My grandparents. Survivors. Birkenau. That explains why you called it a coffin a moment ago. I didn't call it a coffin. You called it a grandfather coffin. Why do you think it symbolizes death to you? Is it possible that what that clock symbolizes to everyone else, survival, is meaningless if you as an only child make no heirs to pass it on to? Perhaps it feels like a physical representation of the final resting place of your family's storyline. A coffin. Okay. And the spiders. Uh, you said you saw a, a pile of... A, a family of, uh, dead bugs. Well, that one seems pretty easy too now. - Tell me. - Well, that's how they did it. They called us bugs until people believed them. You exterminate bugs. Insects. And when they were done, they just piled us. One on top of the other. It's uncomfortable to talk about, isn't it? Horrifying. The ultimate evil. Why do you say that? "The ultimate evil." [chuckles] Well, I hardly need to tell you. Uh, six million... Yeah, but there have been far greater numbers, genocides, than that. So why do people consider this one the worst? Because things were good. This happened amongst wealthy, educated, cultured people. Modern people, between neighbors and friends, husbands and wives, doctors... and patients. So deep down, people understand that if it happened there and then, it could happen here and now. That scares the living shit out of them. What one might be willing to do to another human being if society simply gave them permission. And you... struggle with the concept of bringing a child into a world like that. Anyone who doesn't isn't paying attention. And the very tall woman? No clue. Okay. Very good work today. Now, before we end, I want to talk to you about the results of your blood work. The numbers are what would be considered low. It won't be impossible for you to get pregnant, but in order to accelerate the process, I would like to offer you the option of an implant. Implant? We are finding it highly effective. When? On your last day, we would do a simple procedure, painless, Valium, and implant a small device that would dispense additional hormones in conjunction with the pills. ELLA: And how long does that have to stay in? DR. SIMMONS: Well, the good news, actually, is that, uh, it's not meant to come out. Permanent.

SHAUNA: No, no, stop with that shit. - I don't wanna hear it anymore. - Hear what? How it doesn't come naturally to you when all you have to do is spread your legs to make it happen. That's how easy it could be for you. That is something that I will never have with the person that I love. I don't get to have that. And it hurts. Oh. It hurts. Ohh! Fi! Oh. Fi. Fi, my water! It's so beautiful. What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? [muffled] Stop it. Stop! What is wrong with you? Ella, what the fuck is wrong with you? - I wanna see it. - Don't, don't touch me. - Just let me see it! - No! No! Fi, get her out of here! - ELLA: Give me the baby. - No, get off of her! Get off of her! ELLA: No, I just wanna see it! [indiscernible shouting] Let go of me! [Shauna crying] I just wanna see... I just wanna see the baby. FIONA: No! No! ELLA: Just let me see...

ELLA: Do you have chest pains? JOSEPH: No, I don't. ELLA: Where's the ambulance? JOSEPH: No ambulance. I didn't call an ambulance, I called you. ELLA: What? Are you kidding me?
