Ben, were there any packages for me? No. Sir... the woman over there claims she's your... Jake! Mom, what the hell are you doing here? I need to talk to you. You're not taking any of my calls. I didn't get any. Why don't you come up? I told you to never come here! Please... Don't be mad. I had to! Your father is very sick. He's been in pain for weeks, and unless we can come up with the money for his treatment... "Pain"? Good. I guess my prayers have finally been answered. Jake! I hope it's unbearable. Please! You don't mean that. I know that in the past, you and your father haven't been able to see eye-to-eye... You're really something, aren't you? You're right. We didn't see eye-to-eye. How could we when I was getting the shit kicked out of me at 5 years old?! He admits that he's made mistakes. Making a 10-year-old sit in scalding hot water FOR SPILLING JUICE ON THE FLOOR IS NOT A MISTAKE! That is evil. And you sat right there and you watched him do it. You do not sit on my furniture. You sit on the floor. Sit on the floor! What's he have? He's got cancer. Oh, I can see him rolling around in agony. I... I promise you that if you could just loan us the money, then... then... then we'll pay it back! Oh, so it would be a loan? Yeah, we'll pay... we'll pay it back. You know, you didn't try very hard to give me a loan when I wanted to go to college. Come on! That was different! You didn't try at all. It was different! You didn't need college. Look at you. Look at this place! You designed an app and you sold it and you're this... this millionaire at 18. You're right. I made $1 million off of that app, and I've made about 6 million since. And I would rather throw $100000 into that fireplace and watch it burn before I gave you and Dad a penny of it. I hope that Dad dies a long... slow... painful death. Now, get the hell out of my apartment.

Maddie, I'm talking to you! Don't touch me! I don't wanna hear anything you have to say. Stop accusing me of something that I didn't even do! Don't walk away from me, you stupid bitch! I'm talking to you! You're a psycho! You're the psycho! You're the one that's jumping to idiotic conclusions that aren't even true, and why are you looking at my phone anyway? Take a pill, Brooke. I've had enough of this. I'm leaving. What going on over there? I got it. It's okay. I got it. Hey, are you okay? No. Just take a deep breath. You're fine. How about I get you a drink? I'm not 21 yet. Well, neither am I. All right. So, Brooke, tell me about yourself. Um... Not much to tell. Come on. Um... I'm a senior at Bellamy High. I'm a cheerleader. I live with my mom. She has a boyfriend named Alex. Hmm. Okay. Hey! Hey! This is Jake. I literally just met him. This is Keisha, my friend from school. Pleasure. Jake. Um... Everybody's calling it a night. Are you gonna stay? Yeah, I think I'm gonna hang around for a bit longer. Are you sure? Yes. I'll see you at school. Okay. Text me. I think she's worried about you. Should she be? I don't think so. I'm a pretty decent guy. I consider myself a gentleman. You know, most guys from Kansas probably do. Kansas? That is so random. Yeah. What brought you out to Pennsylvania? Ah, it's a long story. I've got time. Okay. Well... I bailed out of my parents' house when I was 17 and moved up here, I don't know, a couple of years ago. And then I created an app. Sold it. Made enough money to live on the rest of my life. Wow! Why did you leave your parents' house? Uh... Go. Got a bottle of our best champagne and two glasses. My man. Do you know what? Just throw it on my tab. You know what? Cheers. ♪ He turns away ♪ He turns around ♪ ♪ Baby, can you read my mind? ♪ Okay, so you gotta tell me what happened between you and your friend, because honestly, I thought you were about to break out the boxing gloves. I mean, what could she have done, sleep with your boyfriend? No. Wrecked your car? Her ex texted me and now, she thinks that I'm trying to get with him, but I would never do that. Oh, okay. So, you just really don't like being accused of things that you didn't do? No. I have this... condition... that I have to take pills for, and the doctors haven't quite got the dosage right yet. Well, does this... condition have a name? It's called... intermittent explosive disorder, IED. I go into these... rages, and it can get pretty crazy. Is this your car? Yeah. All right. Hop in. Let's go. And on the way, you can tell me the rest of that story. Wow. That's crazy. So it happened during cheerleading? Yeah. I hit my head pretty hard. Brooke! Brooke? Call 911! They said that when I hit my head, it started slowing down the production of serotonin. It's a... I know what it does. It regulates your impulse control. How did you know that? I'm smarter than I look. So, do you take any medication for it? Yup... which I am not supposed to be drinking on. Which neither one of us should be drinking, since, you know, we're not 21. True. Look, I'm pretty much the same way. I fly off the handle sometimes, and I say some pretty nasty things. Mm-hmm... You do realize we sound like a couple of jerks right now? Yeah, to the people that don't know us, but... I get the sense you can be really sweet too. Maybe. I think this is the part where I'm supposed to ask you on a real date. Really?! After what I just told you? Come on, that doesn't scare me. Okay. Give me your phone. But wait! Wait. A gentleman! Always. So... I'll call you tomorrow. Goodnight. Brooke Emerson. Wow. Who was that guy? Were you spying on me? No, I heard his car. And besides, it's half an hour past your curfew. Why didn't Maddie bring you home? Maddie decided to leave early. Did you meet that guy tonight? He's Keisha's friend. What's the big deal? Well, how old is he? I don't know! Like 18. 18?! What kind of 18-year-old drives around in a $100000 sports car? Rich ones! Oh, my God! Enough! Like, stop! Look, I'm telling you, man, it's like this girl, she is something special. Yeah. She is so... just... different from anybody that I've ever met. Oh, yeah? How so? It's just... It's like, I get her. She gets me. It's like I've filled in that piece that's... that's always been missing. It's like... I feel like I belong, and it's just, I've got the right person at the right time. It's just... Wow. "Sufferers experience hostility, aggressive outbursts and sudden episodes of anger." They don't understand you, Brooke. No one does. But I do. I know exactly how you feel. Hey, girl. Hey. You know that black dress you wore to the club that one night? Could I borrow it? Where is he taking you? Wally's on Main. Holy crap! I know, right?! Okay, yes. I will bring you that dress tomorrow night. Thank you. Bye. What's up, Alex? What are you guys doing? Oh, desperately trying to make sense of these instructions. It's a new chair for your room. Oh! Well, that's nice. Good luck with your project. What time will you be back tonight? Uh... We'll probably hang out after, so... like midnight? Not a minute after.

I think we should fly to Paris this weekend and buy it. Wow. You look... incredible. You were right. It's bigger than the one she broke. Hmm. I don't think it's helping. It takes time to figure out. Didn't her therapist say different things work for different people? Yeah, but it's not fair. Why'd this have to happen to her? There are days that she doesn't even seem like the same daughter that I used to have. Hey... it's not just the IED. She's a teenager. If you could've seen how difficult Joey was at times... Hey. She's a good kid, and you're a great mom. Hmm. She'll get past this. Thank you. So... What type of girls do you usually see? The kind that I only date once. It's been really tough to find people that I connect with. Hmm. I can feel that. I think I get you, though. Oh, you definitely do. I knew that the second I started talking to you. Well, on that note, I'm gonna excuse myself to the bathroom. Yeah, but... you and Brooke have been best friends since like, junior high. So what? I'm sick of her craziness. It's not like Brooke asked for that head injury. He's always liked her, you know? Who? Tryg? I used to catch him checking her out all the time. We fought about it a few times. Look, that sounds like it's on Tryg, not Brooke. She'd never stab you in the back like that. Maybe she wouldn't, maybe she would. Maddie, come on! What? Thanks for helping me with this homework, by the way. Yeah. No problem. Hey, Brooke. Hey... Tryg. I hit you up the other night. Did you get my text? Yeah, I did. Did you need something? I just wanted to see what you were up to and I thought maybe we could, I don't know, hang out? Is everything all right here? Yeah. It's cool, man. We go to school together. Hmm. Well... we're on this thing called a date, so maybe save the chitchat for between classes. Seriously, dude. We're trying to have dinner. Yeah. My bad. I'll just talk to you tomorrow, Brooke. Yeah. Who was that guy? That was Tryg, Maddie's ex. I didn't know he worked here. The girl that you fought with? Yeah, it was over him! He texted me saying, "Hey, gorgeous." And she saw it. I don't even know why he did that. We don't even talk. Let's forget about him, and let's get some dessert. All right? Thanks for accepting my invitation tonight. This is probably the best date I've ever been on. Jake... Jake... Jake. Wow. Will access the vehicle's computer "and bypass the door locks. Will cost 58.99." One, two, three! Let's go Sharks! Nice job today, guys. Woo! Same time tomorrow. What the hell?! Please, don't tell me to go away. I'm sorry for blowing up at you at karaoke, but there's nothing going on with me and Tryg. I promise, I would never do that to you. I guess you didn't hear. Tryg was assaulted and robbed last night as he was leaving his job. What?! That's horrible. If there's anything I can do... Maybe you need to up your medication. Seriously. Brooke. Jake... What are you doing here? You didn't respond to any of my calls. Yeah, I've been at practice since 7:30. How did you get on campus? I must look like a student 'cause I just walked right in. Look, I'm not trying to bug you or anything, I just... when I didn't hear back from you, I wanted to make sure everything was okay. Yeah, everything's fine. I just can't answer you back when I'm at school. Yeah, but I mean, come on. A quick text? How long does that take? I would've answered you eventually. When? When I have time. So this is a game to you? You wanna keep me by the phone waiting, wondering if you're pissed off or not, trying to be the one in control? No! Not at all. This is me having a life. I should've seen this coming. You are like every other girl! You want me there to pay for a nice night out, but then you wanna just respond when you have time? What are you talking about?! You're the one who called me four times in an hour! That's obsessive. That's a relationship, Brooke! And if you don't know how those work, then stay out of them until you grow up! Brooke? Is everything okay here? It's whatever you want. "I'm sorry for upsetting you. "I really did come by because I was worried about you. Please call me. Love, Jake." Hey. Hi. You got my card? Yup. I did. I'm really sorry. I was just worried is all. Jake, you said some really mean things to me today: That I was playing games with you, and that I'm only with you for your money. I know. I know, and I'm... I'm really sorry about that too. I really didn't mean any of it. I was just... I was just upset is all. Look, if that's what you think of me... I don't. Brooke, please. I say things that I don't mean when I'm angry. I mean, you of all people should understand. Just please give me a second chance. I really don't think that anything's happened that we can't work through. Okay. I need to think about it. I'll call you later. Okay. Can I help you? You're Brooke's mom? I am, and you are... I'm Jake. Oh. Jake. Hi. Nice to meet you. Come on in. Thank you. You're Keisha's friend, right? Jake? What are you doing here? I just wanted to bring these by for you. Thanks. Well, I think my dinner's going to burn, so I better get back to the kitchen. Of course. Whatever you're having smells really good. Oh, it's just pasta. It was nice to meet you, Ms. Emerson. You too. Are you pissed that I brought you flowers? No, I'm pissed that you showed up here without calling me first. I just can't seem to do anything right today. I figured it would be a really nice surprise since I screwed up so royally this morning. Should I just take the flowers, and let's pretend this never happened? No. No, I like the flowers. I'm gonna keep them. All right. Well... I'll go so you guys can eat. Goodnight. Wait. Have you eaten yet? It's been so long since I've had a home-cooked meal. Did your mother work a lot? She did when I was growing up, but when I sold the app, I gave most of my money to my parents, so they could retire early. Well, that's sweet. Well, they worked hard to raise me, so it was the least that I could do. Hmm. Well, I think your mom really likes me. Why'd you say that stuff about your parents? It's not true. Well, I figured it'd be a lot better than stories about how they locked me in the closet, don't you think? It'd kind of put a damper on dinner. The reason why I brought you the flowers is I just, I wanted to see you. I wanted to talk you out of dumping me. I'm not dumping you. Phew! Good, because I was working on an app to keep you from doing that. Go home. Could I see you on Saturday? I'm going to a party that night. Oh. I like parties. Is it with people from your school? No. It'll be like, a bunch of different people. It's at that guy Riley's house, the one who intervened at school. Well, I kind of owe him an apology anyways. So if I promise to behave, can I come? Yeah, I guess. All right. Goodnight, gorgeous. I promise I'm not gonna let you down. So... He's nice. I like him. You do? Yeah, he's... Well, he's smart. He's polite, successful, cute. Gosh, what is there not to like? Unless there's something more about him I should know... No. I think he's a good guy. All right, it's ready. Are we ready to eat? You hungry? We're starving! Good morning. Oh. Thank you, Brooke. Can I spend the night at Keisha's tonight? Hmm. You're not really spending the night with Jake, are you? No! I swear on my life! I think he's more into me than I'm into him. Really? He seems so nice. Did something happen between the two of you? No, nothing specific. So? About that sleepover? Okay. Fine. Hey man, look. Honestly, I just, I know it must have looked weird the other day when I showed up at the school, so I just wanted to apologize. You don't have to apologize to me, man. As long as Brooke's okay, so am I. She is. Maddie's here with Tryg. She seems okay, but I can't believe she went back to him. Do you think it's a pity thing? No. Good for them. Okay... Shot? Thanks. Goodbye. Okay... does anyone want any more drinks? Um, no. I think I've had enough. I think maybe you should slow down too. I thought... I thought you weren't even supposed to drink while you're on those pills. No! I am so fine. I just want water, and I didn't take the pills. Let me just go get it for you. No! You stay. Stay. I'm going. Goodbye. I'm out. Hey. Hey. That's really messed up, what happened to you. Are you okay? Yeah, I'll be fine in a month or two. Can I talk to you about Maddie? Honestly, whatever's going on between the two of you, just keep it your business. Like, she's not even talking to me right now. All I'm saying is if... you told me today that you wanted to give it a shot with me, I would dump her in a second. What? That is so weird and shitty! Why are you even with her? Because you're with that douche. I'd never do that! I knew it! You're such a liar. What? I can't believe I was gonna give you another chance. And you! All that crap about how you wanted me back and how sorry you were? What was that about? You should be mad at him! It takes two, Brooke! Can you not do this? Remember what happened last time? You know what? If you want him, you can have him. He's a loser anyways! Stop accusing me of shit! You've always wanted to sleep with him! Fine! You two deserve each other! You know what? Screw you! No! I hate her! I hate this bitch! I need another drink. Ugh! Brooke! Brooke. Brooke, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Look. Let's ditch all of these losers and let's get out of here. They're not losers. They're my friends. Yeah, great friends. All she's done is fight with you, and everyone is just crowding around her like she's some little damsel in distress. Let's just go back to my place. No. You go. I'm staying. Brooke. Listen to me. You are wasted right now. You have no clue what you're saying. I know how to take care of my drunk girlfriend. Jake, I am not your girlfriend. Yes, you are. No, I'm not! Stop trying to run my life! Brooke, I am trying to do what's best for you right now. Oh! You, my mom, everyone knows what's best for me. Well, you know what? I know what's best for me! I know! And I don't need you. Okay? I'm done! Brooke, please just stop being an idiot for two seconds. Just listen to me! Now you're calling me names? No! Seriously Jake, get the hell out of here! Okay? I don't need you! Just leave me alone! Everything okay? Yeah. I think she just needs to sleep it off. That's fine. She can stay here. Okay. Cool. DAMN IT! Okay. I've gotta keep her. I've gotta keep her. ♪ Who's it gonna be, love? ♪ ♪ Who's it gonna be, love? Who's gonna be ♪ ♪ The last one standing?

Maddie? No! I couldn't have done this! Mom... What are you doing up? I thought I heard something. What are you doing home already? I think I'm getting sick. I think I have the flu or something. Oh. Well, you don't have a fever. Whose hoodie is that? It's... it's Riley's. I was cold, so I... I put it on. I'm just gonna go take a shower and get some rest. Sweetheart, are you okay? I'm fine! I have cheer camp in the morning, and I'm exhausted, and I wish you wouldn't interrogate me when I walk through the door! Brooke... Mom! Just leave me alone! Damn it. Keisha? Yeah. No, I'm coming. I'm on my way. Hello? Riley? Mr. Pratt? Who are you? Oh, shoot. Sorry. I must've passed out here last night. I had way too much to drink. Call the police. CALL THE POLICE! Brooke? What's going on in here? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. I just need a minute. Where's Maddie today? I don't know. See you out there. I'm telling you I didn't kill her! Look, after the big fight with Brooke, I did a few shots. I went looking for Maddie and I found her in a bathroom. What was the fight with Brooke about? Maddie thought I was trying to get with Brooke behind Maddie's back. Were you? No! Look, of... of course not! I... I loved Maddie. All right? She and Brooke just had this weird jealousy thing between them. Have they fought before? A lot. Brooke told me they got into a fight recently at a karaoke bar. I wasn't there, but I heard it got bad. What happened after Maddie told you to leave her alone? I went outside. I had a beer with Riley. I don't know where Maddie went. I was too drunk to drive home, so I went upstairs. I found an empty bed, and I went to sleep. You never saw her at all after that? No. You know this doesn't look good for you, right? Your ex-girlfriend gets murdered after you and she have a big public fight. Unless there's someone else we need to look at, I'm looking directly at you. Who do you think murdered Maddie? I don't know. The only person I can think of... but they were best friends. Who? Brooke Emerson. You're mine forever, Brooke. Wow. You look like death. What does that mean? Brooke, you were so wasted last night, you could barely walk by yourself. What time did you leave? I don't know. After 2. I don't remember. Do you remember fighting with Maddie? A little. Why? What did we fight about? Tryg. And then you passed out upstairs. All right, guys. Let's show 'em in the high V again, huh? Great. Nice and high. Awesome. Detective Myers. We found one of your students dead this morning: Maddie Finley. I have a few questions to ask you. We're investigating a situation that happened earlier this morning. What kind of situation? How do you know Maddie Finley? Um... We're friends. I understand you were at a party where she was last night, at the home of... Riley Pratt. Did you get into a fight with Maddie there? Um... I don't remember. You don't? Why not? I take this medication and... sometimes I don't remember things. Does that happen to you a lot? No, not really. Did Maddie ever talk to you about Tryg Bailey, her ex? Yeah, of course. Were they on good terms? Yeah, for the most part, but... Maddie always thought that I was going after Tryg or something, but I would never do that to her. What time did you leave the party to go home? 2? I woke up in a guest bedroom and um... I left right after that. Did you see Maddie as you were leaving? Yeah. I saw her in the kitchen. I didn't talk to her, though. So you remember that part of the evening? Well, yeah. It was before that. That's when it gets a bit fuzzy. Brooke... Maddie was found dead this morning at the Pratt residence. How? I can't give details at the moment... ...but it appears to have been a homicide. This is crazy... She was fine... Oh, my God! Hey. How was cheer camp? What's wrong? Did something happen? Maddie was... murdered last night. What?! The police, they ca... they came to my camp, and they were asking all these... questions, and... it happened at this party we were all at yesterday, and I was there, and we were all there. Oh, my God. I guess their housekeeper found her this morning. And all this happened at a... at a party last night? I'm sorry I lied to you. What went on there? I don't remember. I got so drunk, and we got into this huge fight. About what? Tryg, I guess. I went upstairs, and I passed out. Brooke... Mom... I think the police might suspect me because me and Maddie got into that fight. They were asking me all these questions. Did you tell them the truth? Yeah. Well then, there's... there's nothing to worry about. I... I bet the police were asking everybody at the party a lot of questions. This is so horrible! I... Who are you calling? I'm calling Maddie's mom! We need to give her our condolences. I... No. You know what? We just, um... We need to go over there in person. What do you think of the girl, Brooke? They had a fight. It doesn't mean she killed her. True, but... when I interviewed her, it seemed like she was holding back. You got that same feeling about Tryg. Riley... the kid who lives in the house? He said that Tryg had just got back together with the dead girl, but was carrying a torch for Brooke. According to Tryg, he was head-over-heels for Maddie. Interesting little love triangle. With all that going on, it's kind of hard to believe it was someone completely unrelated. Yeah, look. I hear you, but there were 50 people there last night, going in and out of that house. The doors were unlocked. I mean, people who didn't even attend knew about the party. Look, let's just keep an open mind. Okay? And who else was there that we need to talk to? We haven't reached out to any of the neighbours. Let's do it. I couldn't have done this. Jake? Hey. What are you doing here? I just wanted to talk to you. I'm really sorry about your friend. How do you even know?! It's on the news. They gave out her address? No, I just... I followed you and your mom from your house. What?! I have to go. Jake, I appreciate your concern... but I just really need to be left alone right now. This is a really hard time for me and my mom and... I can't deal with this! What do you mean, "you can't deal with this"? I just wanted to support you. I get it, but your presence makes things complicated. I don't want to be in a relationship with you. Don't go, Brooke. I love you! But you don't even know me! Yes, I do! We get each other on a whole other level! Jake, leave me alone. I don't like you that way. Hello, Jake. Hey. Brooke, honey, why did you leave like that? I needed to talk to him. He heard what happened on the news. Yeah, I think that we're all... still in shock. I am. It's... It's unbelievable. Yeah. I really hope that they catch that monster and put him behind bars for a very, very long time. Yeah, so do I. Mom? Are you ready to go? Sure, but don't you wanna go inside and say goodbye to Maddie's mom? Okay. No! I hate her! I hate this bitch! You've reached the office of Dr. Fenson. Please leave a message, and someone will return your call during office hours. Hi, Dr. Fenson. It's Brooke Emerson calling. I really need to speak to you. I was hoping if you could find time tomorrow for me, that'd be great. Let me know. Thanks. Bye. Just answer me, Brooke. Just answer me, Brooke! It's a simple question! JUST ANSWER ME! GOD! Why are you doing this to me? Just stop ignoring me! Tell me what's going on with you. Did you hear about that Maddie Finley girl... in the news? The one that got murdered at that party? Yes. Well, that was my friend, Maddie, and I was there when it happened. Oh, Brooke. That's terrible. We got into this... huge fight, and I can't remember anything that I said. Were you drinking? Yeah. But I didn't take a pill that day intentionally, and I don't know why I can't remember anything! Well, skipping one pill isn't gonna make a difference. It can take up to a week for medication to leave your body. What do you really wanna tell me, Brooke? I wanna help the police. I do, but I can't remember anything. And I'm trying so hard, but I can't. I need to know what happened. I need to know who did this! Let's, uh... talk about what you remember when you woke up. I can't. I can't. I have to go. I can't. Hey. Are you okay? How did you get in here? I'm everywhere. Why are you making this so hard? What do you want from me? I just wanna see you. I wanna spend time with you. I wanna love you, just like we were before. Are you not listening to me?! You're acting completely crazy! I am not crazy. Don't you ever say that to me again. Breaking into someone's house is not normal. All I want is to have somebody that I connect with. Someone that I can do anything for and that will do anything for me, and that person is you, Brooke! You don't know what true love is, and that's why you don't understand any of this. I don't love you, Jake. Brooke... I can make things very complicated for you... or I can make them easy. What does that mean? We both know that you killed Maddie, don't we? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. That's why you hid the knife and your shirt in the pillowcase and put it in the dumpster. Guess what? They're not in the dumpster anymore! Where are they? They're safe. And as long as you're with me, they'll stay safe. So you're blackmailing me to be with you? No! No, I just want you to realize that I'm important in your life. You and I are connected for the rest of our lives. And I will keep your secret forever. I did not kill her. Brooke. Come on. You wouldn't have ditched the murder weapon if you were innocent. You even sent me pictures of her body. No, I didn't! I would never do that! It's okay. I have an app that encrypts all the texts that are sent and received, so... you're fine. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey. That was the homeowner that lives down the street from the Pratt house. He said when he pulled into his driveway at 3 AM, there was a high-end sports car parked across from his house. He said he'd never seen it before. Make? Model? Colour? He's not sure about the colour. It was dark, but he thinks it might have been a Mercedes or a BMW. Expensive. Uh-huh. This is insane. I wish I could just wake up and have this all be a nightmare. Brooke... this is real. I'm the only one that knows what you did, and as long as we're together, no one's ever gonna know. I got you something. You don't have to say yes right now, but... I couldn't help it when I saw it. I had to get it. And I didn't have the ring sizes either, so I just had to guess, but we can... we can get it resized. No, Jake! Please, stop! STOP PLAYING GAMES WITH ME, BROOKE! JUST BE HAPPY! Do you not see that I will do anything to make you happy? DO YOU NOT GET THAT?! Mom... Brooke. What are you doing here? Instead of going to school, I went to go see Dr. Fenson. Oh, honey. I know this is a difficult time for you. What'd she say? I wanted to tell her, I just... couldn't bring myself to do it. Tell her what? Oh, God. Where do I even start? Hey, Brooke. Am I interrupting? Could you just give us a couple minutes? No, it's okay. Alex can stay. I don't even know how to say this. Oh, honey, just... just tell us. Whatever it is, we're here for you. I think I killed Maddie. Wha... What?! Why would you think such a thing? I drank a lot that night. I got so drunk. Maddie and I got into this fight and... according to Riley, I... I passed out in the guest room, and... then the next thing I remember was waking up... What? I... I woke up to her dead body laying there beside me. There was all this blood, and... there was the knife, and... there's even pictures of her body on my phone. Oh, my God. I freaked out. I took all the evidence, and I put in a trash bag, and then I went to the dumpster, and I dumped it out. Where? It's not there anymore. You looked? No. Jake followed me there after, and... he took it. He said... if I don't stay with him, he's gonna bring it to the police. Okay. Hold on. What does Jake have to do with any of this? He came to the party with me, but Riley said he saw him leave after I passed out. He's been stalking me ever since our first date. What... what do you mean? He shows up at school randomly, and he came to Maddie's house that one time we were there. He gave me this, and... and said I had to stay with him, so that he would... he would keep the secret about what I did. You've got to be kidding me! I don't know what to do, but I can't live like this! I... I can't sleep. All I keep thinking about is what I did to Maddie. Brooke. You didn't do anything to Maddie. You are not a killer. How do you know that? How do you know? I could've gotten so mad that I could've done it! I just wish I could remember what happened. It sounds to me like maybe Jake is involved. He was in the house. No. Riley saw him leave. He could've come back. But... if... he's so in love with me, then why would he do that? To have something to lord over you. Mom, I don't know what to do. Okay. We need to go to the police, and we're going to tell them all of this. No. I can't. They're gonna think I did it. I... I lied to them about where I was. I lied to them about what time I left. I lied to them about seeing Maddie. It doesn't matter. Okay? We have to get a lawyer. They want to solve this case, and if somehow he is the killer, they'll wanna know this. He's right. So he has evidence, including the murder weapon, in his possession right now? I guess he still has it, or... he got rid of it somehow. I don't know. Why did you lie to us when we questioned you the first time? She's 17, Detective, and very traumatized. Now, what's important is that she's coming to you now with the truth. And we do appreciate that. That doesn't mean we've cleared her as a suspect. Are you going to question Jake? Tell us everything you know about him. How'd it go? Uh... Good. They seemed open to the possibility that Jake was involved. I saw the new alarm system. Yeah. Your new key is on the kitchen counter. Code is set. He's driven by twice. Jake? Yeah. Unreal. Brooke? I'm sorry. Are you okay? I thought I heard something. Well, the alarm system's on. Everything is secure. Don't worry. He's not gonna get in. Are you sure? Positive. Come on. Try and get some sleep. Why can't you love me? Hey. Hey, girl. Come in. It's like Fort Knox here now. Yeah, we just got that installed yesterday. Are you worried that whoever killed Maddie's gonna come after you? You can never be too careful, right? Shouldn't you be in chem? I was worried when I didn't see you at school today. Yeah. I'm fine. I just, I'm not ready to go back yet. Maybe next week. Brooke... I think you should come back sooner than later. Why? People are talking. Tryg said that he saw you at the police station with your lawyer, and that you're about to get arrested for Maddie's murder. Is that true? No. I mean... Yeah, I was at the police station, but I was just giving information. About what? I can't say... but I can tell you that they're looking at new suspects. Well, you need to defend yourself. People are doing crazy stuff. Like what? Someone wrote "murderer" on your locker. Yeah? Mr. Campali? There's a Detective Lynn Grinly here to see you. Sure. Send her up. And when you left the party, was Brooke still there? That's right. Where did you go after you left? Home. And when was the next time you spoke to Brooke? Uh... The next day. I just texted her to make sure she was all right. Did Brooke say anything to you about what happened after she woke up the next morning? No. Did she ever talk to you about bloody clothing or... give you a trash bag and ask you to hide it for her? Uh... No. Never. So you know nothing about what happened to the clothes she was wearing at the party? No. I don't. Brooke. Hey. I can't do this anymore. Do what? Calm down. Talk to me. What I did to Maddie. It's all I think about. I can't sleep, and when I do sleep, it's all I dream about. Don't do that to yourself. It was your IED that caused it. Not you. No! I'm responsible for her death. I'm the reason she's gone. Even people at school think I did it too. Who cares what those idiots think? Look, I know that you're a good person, Brooke, and that's what matters. No, I'm not. I'm horrible. And the police think I did it too. Well, the police don't have any evidence to convict you, so don't let them put the pressure on you. Jake... I'm done. What does that mean? I just wanted to say goodbye. There's a note in my room explaining everything. No! No! No, no, no, no! Brooke, listen to me. Where are you? There's things that you don't know. I'm responsible for her death! Let's please meet! Just let's talk in person. Goodbye, Jake. I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you find the love you're looking for. You didn't kill Maddie! What? You didn't kill her. Where are you? I will tell you everything. There's nothing left to talk about. Yes, there is! There really is, Brooke. Where are you? I'm at a truck stop... on Lawson and 145th Street. Okay. Stay there. I'll be there in 10 minutes. Don't move. Brooke! Brooke... are you okay? Brooke, you scared the shit out of me! You're lying to me. You're trying to tell me I didn't kill Maddie so I won't kill myself. No. No, no, no. You... You are completely innocent, okay? I killed Maddie. What? Why? Just listen, okay? Maddie was not your friend. All she did was keep accusing you and causing you all of this emotional turmoil that you're feeling. So you killed her because of that? No! But I... That night at the party, I saw you talking to that moron, Tryg, and I got so jealous, 'cause before we even got to the party, I could feel you pulling away from me. And the first few times, God, it was... it was so perfect. Then it started to change. I don't even get what you're saying right now. I needed to find a way to prove to you that you could trust me, Brooke. We are perfect for each other. So you were trying to blackmail me? No! I needed you to know that you can trust me! And that I can keep your secret. Okay? So, what? You left and came back, or... No. I sat in my car, and I was thinking. And then when I came back inside to check on you, to make sure that you were all right... ...I saw Maddie passed out next to you, and then... I realized what I needed to do. So you knew you were gonna kill her that night. You took the knife, and you knew you were gonna do it. No! I got the knife from the kitchen. It wasn't pre-planned at all. I can't believe you killed my best friend! Brooke, I am your best friend! I am! What do you not get about that? You tried to frame me for murder! No! I would have never let you go to prison for that! Yeah, as long as I stayed with you! Yes! Exactly! I knew I was gonna have to tell you about this night at some point, and I had to tell you tonight so that you won't hurt yourself. Jake... You have to tell the police. You have to tell them the truth. They're going to arrest me! They're not! No. They don't have any evidence to convict you. You're fine. I'm fine. Maddie's murder is gonna go unsolved, and then you... you and I are gonna live happily ever after, anywhere that you want. Look at me. Jake Campali! Come out of the car with your hands over your head! You set me up? Put the weapon down! Get out of that car! Exit the vehicle with your hands up! You really didn't think we'd give a killer a loaded gun, did you? Drop the gun, Jake. It's over. Drop the gun and get out of the car slowly! Come on, Jake. Just give it up. You okay? Yeah. Brooke! You remember that I did this for you. Yeah, and I did this for Maddie! Brooke! Mom! Oh, honey... you did it. I was so scared. I miss you. We can get a lot for this. Serves the ungrateful punk right for not helping me when I had cancer. What kind did you say I had? Stomach... I think. Maybe colon. I can't remember. Sorry, I can't take your call at the moment. Please leave me a message. Mom, please. I really... I really need you. I'm scared.
