MAN: Women don't understand, you know? I mean, I don't know what they expect. Er, well, I guess I do know what they expect. WOMAN: So last night, we were trying and I just felt so ill, I...I threw up. WOMAN 2: I gave masturbation another go. WOMAN 3: How'd it go? No orgasm, not even arousal, darn it. Can you tell me how you first find out that you might be asexual? Oh. I never, I never felt the attraction. It was about fifth grade, so. I've-- I will say I feel much better not studying the porn all the time. Um, that was a great suggestion from you guys. WOMAN 3: Well that's great! Congratulations. MAN: Thank you. So we have a new face. Welcome. It's your first time? Yes. Hi, I'm Olivia. Hi, Olivia. Hey. WOMAN 3: Hi, Olivia. And I'm here because I think I might be... Um, I'm 27. And I don't have any clue as to what my orientation is. Well many of us tried on different orientations Gay. Bi. Straight. MAN: Cross dresser. But it wasn't until we found other Aces that we could really find a label that fit. But I haven't tried anything, though. Olivia, Asexual Support welcomes you. Thank you. Um, hi. Wow! This is so awkward, um... I guess I'm... searching? I think I have a-- an issue with intimacy. So I don't really know what it's like to... to have a relationship. You know we are in a society where people are, like, force-fed sex constantly. Why do we need that much... sex? And I just, it, I... Heh. I can't function. I can't function normally in society, and it... I need-- I need to work on that. Thanks. Olivia. I think you might wanna try out some different support groups. What do you mean? Sometimes people use asexuality to hide. There's no right or wrong, but... it's just all about finding the right fit for you. Ok. Ok? Uh-huh. [POP MUSIC PLAYS] [INHALES] For the record, I don't think you're an asexual. Who told you? In the bathroom. Ok, so it's something that I've been looking into as an option. One that fits quite well, actually. You might also wanna try sex as an option too. Ah, ok. Too much pressure. OLIVIA: So in reality it wasn't the Simone de Beauvoirs but the Shulamith Firestones that paved the way for the Riot Grrrls-- Olivia! Congratulations on the Provosts' grant. I'm very happy for you. Thank you. Bye. OLIVIA: "Once conform, "once do what other people do because they do it, "and a lethargy steals over all the finer nerves and faculties of the soul." "She becomes all outer show and inward emptiness; "dull, callous, and indifferent." Excuse me. Excuse me. Karl is it? Uh, please tell me, why are you here? You have no concept of a brilliant mind's deepest thoughts. This is an upper level course, and you guys are sitting here pretending like you're fulfilling some breadth requirement with no care in the world except your next date or screw! Well you know what, I've had it with you cocksuckers! [GASPS] Class is dismissed! [MURMURING] Olivia. Olivia, are you ok? I'm a horrible person! You're just stressed. It happens. [CRYING] I just blew up at them. Olivia, do you think this has anything to do with that asexuality group? Does everybody know about that?! Your friends have just been a little concerned, I mean you've been a little freaked out lately-- Yeah. Well, I'm frustrated by the porn-centric culture! I think maybe you should just get it over with, you know. I mean, just go to a bar-- I'm not gonna take my life in my hands with some stranger. I think you're putting a lot of importance on this act. That's easy enough for you to say. You've been doing it for years with a variety of partners. I have been lucky. Sorry. Well, I haven't. So for me, there's asexual support. Asexual Support System. ASS. Heh-heh. MAN: That performance can't be repeated if you're to continue teaching your own seminars, Olivia. I know. It won't. You see, aside from your free-floating rage, there is a concern in this department that you lack the life experience to take on Modernism and Realism as you've chosen to do. But all I've ever wanted to do is be a professor, and all I've ever loved my entire life is language. And yet you seem unconcerned with the very stuff language expresses-- our shared struggles, our deepest humanity. You seem averse to self-exploration. Nothing personal has emerged in your work. Well... what do you suggest that I do then? Live a little. So he just told you that you need to live more? Yes! I don't even know what that means. Hey, stranger.Hey! Hi. Sorry, I know that's annoying. Sorry. No, it's ok. No, um...I respect both of you a lot. So it's ok. Doesn't she look terrific today? Yeah. Yeah, you look good. Yeah, thanks. A skirt can help with the transition into the superficial object of male desire, but my entire being is basically untouchable. I am aware of that. Ok, I'm just going to go back to work. No, no wait! What if you had sex with Julian? I mean, you guys get along. I...I... Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Um...Look, I mean it's-- it's not a big deal, you know. I mean, just try him out. Um, because intercourse right now would completely derail my emerging asexuality. Heh. I kinda think maybe it would help clear some of that stuff up for you, actually. Yeah. It's fun. No, I-- you guys are in love. I couldn't possibly get in the way of that. You wouldn't. We have a huge amount of trust in our relationship. Well...I, um... Look, Olivia, it's like, if I didn't know about it then it would definitely be wrong. But I know about it, so it's fine. JULIAN: Yeah. It makes sense to me. Mm-hmm. He's really great too. Uh, great. I'm sure, um... I mean it would be cheaper than psychotherapy. Heh. Maybe this weekend? I'll go to my parents... I, uh... you go over there and shabam! Uh... Do it! Yeah, ok. Ok. Ok! Um, right. Uh, just text me about it, ok? I will sext you about it. Yeah. Um... All right, well, wanna go with me? Guess I'm having sex. [CHUCKLING] MAN: Sleep with Julian? Felisha's Julian? That's great! Why did I ever agree to this? It's perfectly logical. Julian's hot. I just don't think I can go through with it. That's ok, too. My advisor did encourage some self-exploration on behalf of my work.Your work? Asexuality is not generally considered in the discourse. I--I could be a pioneer-- Whoa. Do it, but don't pawn it off as work. An exploration, an experiment! [GASPS] I'll film it! What, like a porno? No--a legitimate look into my own sexuality and gendering. Sounds...wrong... in so many ways. Are we rolling? We good? Ok. [EXHALES] [CLEARS THROAT] Hmm. The subject of the experiment is me, Olivia Howell. I'm 27. Not only am I a virgin, I have never even made out with anyone... other than on stage in an all-women's production of Bye Bye Birdie, but I digress. Uh, the filming began because I am a scholar who believes in the close reading of texts as a means of approaching understanding. Yet I have repeatedly failed at my own self-analysis and hope that this effort will enable me to interpret my own situation. Dating and courtship rituals have fascinated me in my studies, yet confounded me in my life. I have yet to experience a scintilla of love, let alone mutual lust. But I am embracing this potentially degrading experiment in hopes that it will shed a light on my somewhat peculiar nature. And having sex should make me a somewhat more typical human being. That's it. [POP MUSIC PLAYS] [TEA KETTLE WHISTLING] Is that fence picking on you? Hey, Ray. Um... Um, good morning. I just... I get stuck on things a lot, too, so, um... This is-- your roommate's expecting it. Uh, well, like most of Berkeley, he's still asleep so... I can wait.Um, no, don't, I-- It's just, I don't-- I can't go into what's on this, but it's password protected, uh, actually, Defense Departmentally password protected. Oh, ok. He'll get it. Actually, could you just give it back? Can you just give it back? Um, I just don't want you to see what's on it. I thought you said it was password protected. Yup. Yes. It's password protected, so don't even try. Ok. Ok. Um, goodbye. Watch out, for the-- because of earlier. The fence. Have a good day. So this is my abode. James is my best friend, gay roommate who, uh, he wasn't openly gay when he moved in. Um, and now, now he is out. I never got to openly admire my fellow students in high school. Now I can. Wow! To think, for you, the road to gay was paved by an unrequited crush on Ray Dingman. No fashion sense, but the man is endowed with the face of an angel. Uh, let's talk about your latest accomplishment. I have a new boyfriend, Arturo-- Not that. Uh, before that, please. I recently lost my virginity. Can you elaborate a little bit? I'm a rock climber. And I met this hot instructor mid-cliff-- Can we have the truth, please? I posted an ad on Craigslist, I went for the fellow with the biggest unit, a couple of mai tais, barely remembered it the next morning. Wow, thank you for sharing. So, um, I am doing this video strictly for research purposes, uh, for my thesis. But the film is, is about sex so I thought I would ask you what you think. I'm in your history class. You know me real well. And you're my TA. And I'm here to help you have some hot sex. OLIVIA: Is it really going to be hot? I can't believe you're even asking me this, yes! Physically what is sex to me, is that what you're asking me? OLIVIA: Yes. How can I describe it to you? A man has a penis, and a woman has a vagina. You wear tampons, right? Ok. There's a hole and a rod and these things go together, um... You're kinda like-- [BREATHING HEAVILY] and like, you wanna, like, and you-- What kind of film is this you're, uh, you're documenting here? So here I am walking to Julian's place. Uh, down an alley. Uh, I don't even know if this is his front door or his back door. But he's not here. He's still in class. So, um... we're going to go in here. Felisha is leaving for the weekend, and she is going to donate Julian to me for two nights. Lish, why don't you say something to the camera? Oh, no. This is your thing. I don't want to be on camera. Felisha is five years my junior, bet lifetimes more emotionally evolved. I can't even imagine what it must be like to just donate somebody that you love. Well, what Julian and I have is just, just so special that I just, I trust him completely. [DOOR OPENS] Oh! Here's Julian. Hi, Julian! I didn't know we were starting already. Oh, no, we're not. Can I talk to you a minute? He's not due back yet. Objectively, I'm about to have this experience with a highly desirable specimen. [EXHALES] I think I'm gonna pass out. Um, I think I'm gonna go home. Um, bye, guys. Bye. Oh! Um, uh. Oh, you're leaving? Yes, I'm going. Uh, I'll see you later. Ok, um...bye. OLIVIA: They were making out or something, with me in the next room. He needs to prove his loyalty. She needs to mark him with her scent. I guess this is how they reaffirm their love. I mean, perhaps Felisha is seeking to validate their relationship through the ease with which she can just give Julian away. It's natural. Natural. Strip. Ok. Ok. Um... Uh... Um... Uh... James! James, can you come in here for a second, please? Um... Oh! Oh! I'm not familiar with that region. Yeah, duh, but I seem to have the muslin stuck or something. I can't-- I think you're supposed to apply baby oil first. Will you just help me, please?! This is like hardening into a relief sculpture as we speak. I don't know what to do-- Aah! I'm sorry. It was the best way. Oh! You asshole! You want some tea? Ow! [PLASTIC RUSTLING] This was a mistake. [SCOFFS] You'll be fine. You have no idea what it's like. The standards are every bit as high if not higher for gay guys. It's basically impossible for anyone sleeping with men. Well then, why am I doing this? It was inevitable, after you found out about me. You seemed approachable. You were a non-threat. I'll always be here for you-- as a last resort-- Thanks. But the blind leading the disgusted? Pass. You can just shave the pubes on the other side. Uh, God! I'm just not cut out for sex. This will help. [IMITATES HORN] James, you shouldn't have. Oh. If you're set on filming yourself, you might as well wear something pretty. It goes like that. It goes like that. Oh, stop it. Thank you. OLIVIA: So far the experiment seems to be going as planned. I'm learning a lot. More than I even wanted to know perhaps. But I should reveal to you a little bit about my methodology So, CJ? Come out, reveal yourself. Come. Come on. What? What do you want? Introduce yourself, please. I'm CJ. Am I done? No. CJ is our camerawoman. And just to be completely honest, she's also the person that I made out with in Bye Bye Birdie. But, CJ is gay, in practice, and I am asexual... Heh. in theory. Right. OLIVIA: How do you know, like, how do you know for sure? How did I know I was a lesbian? I just, you just know. I don't know. Do you really think it's worth it? You know, all this sex stuff? You never know until you try it. And until you try it you can't write it off. Ok, so you've had sex. Do you think that I should have sex? Oh, it's a thrill. It's like riding a rollercoaster. It is the greatest experience you can have in your life, over and over and over again. It's a moment of peace, a moment of natural peace in your day, which should happen every day. What about you? What do you think the big thing about sex is? Well, I'm trying to find out. That's what this experiment is helping me figure out. Cool. It's the closest that two people can be, physically, emotionally, spiritually. That's when two people become one. What if part of me goes into them and I never get it back? You'll come back. It's like any other experience in life. Until it actually happens, you don't know. You don't know how it's going to affect you. But you've gotta give it a try. [CJ WHISTLES CATCALL] Shh! This is serious, ok. Oh! You should film this. Here. That's great. Ok. OK! I'm wearing heels and a dress. I have reclaimed the "victimize me" attire and it feels slightly sensual, and slightly annoying. But I'm waiting here at the bus stop for my bus to come which will take me on the final leg of my journey for me to lose my virginity. So... God, these shoes are killing-- Can I-- can I sit down with you guys? [POP MUSIC PLAYS] ♪ Say yes to life, Say yes to love... ♪ These shoes are killing me. Who wears these things? I don't know. I never--never mind. ♪ Say yes to sex, Say yes to laughs ♪ ♪ Say yes to love, Life to the max ♪ ♪ Say yes, baby ♪ Say yes... CJ: Can you wait a moment? I want to be ready to film him. CJ, I want to let you know how much I appreciate everything it is that you're doing for me. Of course. Ok. Do you think I should text him? No, no. Try, try the door. It's unlocked. Go, go, go. Julian? Oh, for God's sakes. Should we leave and come back later? No! Julian? Huh... Oh, shit. Aw, shit. Sorry! Yeah. We'll just be out here. What's up, Olivia? I'm Julian. We haven't meet before. CJ. CJ. What's that stand for? Charlotte Juliana. Whoa! My middle name is Charles. So I'm Julian Charles. CJ: Wow!Charlotte Juliana? That's like the same name but in reverse. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, wow, uh. So, right. You are obviously not ready for us, at all. Yeah. You see before I racked out I was actually gonna jump in the shower, but then I got to thinking, I was like, well maybe I should wait till you get here, see if you wanted to jump in with me-- No. No. I'm clean. Oh, yeah? All right, sure. CJ, why don't we wait here while you do whatever it is that you need to do. [EXHALES] I don't know if I can do this. Olivia, you're making a huge deal out of this. It's just a sexual act, you know. It's just two bodies intertwined doing the deed and afterwards, you know, have a smoke, have a snack. Ok. Definitely take a shower with him beforehand. He has this--this weird thing about the shower. Ow! FELISHA: Video games, he really likes those. Damn it! FELISHA: And, uh, I have some weed in my drawer. Do you wanna comment on what's happening? I--I wanna to clean this place up right now. I hope you don't mind. His cock is really big. [OLIVIA SCREAMS] It's more thick than big so-- Gross! I've heard olive oil helps, you know, to stretch it out, so just maybe, like, moisturize. Um, I think I'm gonna head into the living room. I--I think the shower stopped-- No. You need to stay here. You need to film this. Well. I am beyond letting worldly matters like a dirty apartment and a small pest problem derail my plan. I'm not planning to have sex in the kitchen. I have lived through far worse than this. What are we but bodies, our flesh, dirt-- [GASPS] You're dressed. Should I be dressed? Um, I--um-- Julian, come here. Come here. All right, you might want to, like, ease into things. [GASPS] Some women like that. Yeah. Eh... I'll be back in a few. [GASPS] He was naked! Maybe we should just go. No. No. We are not looking for perfection here. Hey. Would you like to have a seat? Whatever you want me to do. I'm just here to help. So I brought a few things with me that I think might help us to get into a more contemplative yet perhaps erotic mood... I'll just get my bag. It's stuck on something. Aah! Unh. Felisha's been looking for that. Sorry. Sorry. It was just a gag gift. Yeah, I've just never seen one up close... and personal. Don't worry about it. Uh, I, uh... like I said, I brought some things Yeah, sure. Ok, my bag... Here we go. [CLEARS THROAT] "His body was urgent against her, "and she didn't have the heart anymore to fight. "She saw his eyes, tense and brilliant, "fierce, not loving. But her will had left her." Julian, I--I-- I think you should take over from here. I am right here. [CLEARS THROAT] "A strange weight was on her lambs." Uh, limbs. Limbs. Right. "A strange weight was on her limbs. "She was giving way. "She was giving up. "She had to lay-- "lie down there under the bows--boughs "of the tree, like an animal, while he waited, standing there in his shirt and birches." Britches! Heh. That was cool though. The whole trees, animal kingdom thing-- Could you please not do that? Please. Ok. Thank you. Uh, yes. I think I have to take a break. Yeah, sure. CJ: Olivia? [GASPING] Olivia? Maybe we should just go-- No! It's making you too upset-- No! I've been waiting too long. I've come too close. I cannot screw this up. Just start filming. I've read enough to know that it is just a physical act, one that is quite brief, generally speaking. It can be satisfactory amongst complete strangers, or even pleasurable among people who are long past love. Yet something is continually standing in my way of me just getting it over with. Sandwich? [MOUTHS WORDS] Minor horrors like finding a used dildo under a potential partner's chair. [SQUIRTING] I'm gonna get through this night. That's why I brought vino. Just to let you know, I have never relied on the bottle before, and I barely even like the stuff so. Well, cheers. [COUGHS] You know, I'm thinking, maybe we should go lay down on the bed? Sure. I would love to lie on the bed with you! Uh, as far as undressing goes, I think I'm just gonna hold off for now-- Whatever you're comfortable with. And as far as sitting on the comforter versus lying on the top sheet, I think I might need a little more-- I don't think I even have a top sheet. Right. Uh, I... I like you enough that I am comfortable sitting on your unwashed comforter covered in your effluvium. I've got hand sanitizer-- Background, CJ. Heads up! Ahh! What are you doing?! You were about to fall off! It's eight inches to the ground. You were about to hit your head. I'm staying where I feel comfortable. Well, you might want to cross over to my side. When you're ready. All right. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh... Can we turn the light off, please? I won't be able to film anything. Fine. Fine. Just keep it on then. Ok. Could you maybe, could you-- could you put the camera down, please? Thank you, CJ, and now you can go. What if the camera stops? That's just a chance we're gonna have to take, ok? I think I might actually-- take my dress off now. You want some help? No, no, no. I am--no! I am fine. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Sorry, sorry. We're finally alone. Yes. I think you're pretty. And so it begins. So what begins? The superficial talk. Never previously a part of our friendship but necessary now, considering the dire circumstance that I find myself in right now- This might be better if you didn't explain every little thing that we do-- Yes, yes. You're right. Right. It's a problem. I like you-- Um, ah! Aah! There's a cockroach on my leg! Let's see it. He's gone. He's gone. Aah! There it is again! It's my foot. See? Ohh. Um, God, I'm so sorry! Look, we don't have to do this tonight-- You know, you are so right. You are so right. We have the whole weekend, right? Ok. Sure. You could come by tomorrow-- Yeah. Or we could just pick a different location. Whatever you want. You know, the-- the daylight would only help with the filming, right? Look, you seem really stressed about this and this is really just a physical act, it's not even a big deal. Yeah. Yeah, I know. And you are so right to postpone it. I mean, why force it? Though our minds may be willing, our bodies do seem weak, and thus we are ill-suited for this tonight. Goodbye, Julian. Bye. CJ, we're going home! CJ, I know what you're thinking, but this is not a failure. Yeah. Whatever. No, I have made huge gains. I practically stripped naked in front of a man and laid in bed with him. I mean, while I didn't experience any sexual arousal, some hetero tendencies were documented. I just can't believe you didn't do it. [BELL CHIMES] [POP MUSIC PLAYS] ♪ Ain't got no ambition ♪ Ain't got no resolve ♪ But you're on a mission ♪ My problems are solved [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Julian. Hey. Wow, what a surprise. Close your eyes. Um... Mmm. [GASPS] Oh, hiya. Mother! Um...um... I didn't mean to interrupt-- You didn't mention an impending visit. Oh, complete spur of the moment. I think I'll be going-- Pardon me. I'm so rude. Sherri Finch. Julian. Mother, you're tattooed. Also spur of the moment. Wanna head in for a little drinkiepoo? Oh, stay! Let's get to know each other. We are not dating, so there is no point. Hehe. Well, you never know! It was nice to meet you, Mrs.-- Sherri. Sherri Bye, Olivia. Hmm. Hot as hell! Maybe this will go somewhere. OLIVIA: What do you care? You've had no interest in my life so far. I boast about you to everyone! A genius! My little Geni-ums- help me with my bags. OLIVIA: Mother, this is quite possibly the worst weekend for a visit. Ooh, hello. Sherri, so good to see you again. I'll set another place. I met him? When you and Howard were here for Christmas. Ahh. I'm so glad that Olivia's got a nice boyfriend! Ah, yes. James is not my boyfriend. Sherri, I don't know if you remember this, but I'm gay. Oh, I had no idea! You'll meet your man.Mother... Just have faith. Yeah, shocking as it may be, my self-esteem does not hinge on me having a man in my life! Oh, sure, I know. Ooh, peaches. I can make bellinis! Olivia. Hi... Ray. Hey. Um, I saw you. I'm parked right there. I can give you a ride. You don't know where I'm going. True. But this is a bus stop, so it's local. Um, where are you going? To Julian's, um, a friend's. Boyfriend. No. I need to get that drive back. Ok. Did you look at it? I did not look at your password protected Defense Department Math Department drive. No. Ok. So I'll pick it up tomorrow. Ok. Ok. OLIVIA: Um, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions. Good. So what are your opinions on sex? Um, it's a natural progression. Profession? Progression. Thank God. You scared me for a second there. Yes. So when did you personally decide to have sex? I'm sorry, it's... I--are we talking about like. I thought I was coming in as like my scientific approach-- Um, no, I was I was thinking more about, like, what you--what you thought. Well, the big deal is, you could potentially die from it. Like HPV-- You could? is one of the leading causes of cervical cancer so-- That's kinda terrifying. Handjobs are ok. I think I've just I'm screwing this--this-- should you cut? OLIVIA: What was it like your first time? I mean were you, like, super nervous? Or were you, like, yeah, I'm totally going to do this? Or were you, like, were you afraid? Did you have any, like, physical issues like heavy breathing or panic attacks? God, does this even make sense for me to have sex? You know everyone marches to the beat of their own drum. You know, everyone kind of moves at their own pace. Oh, God. Come here. All right? I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ok. All right. Just don't blow it this time. Right. Yeah Careful with that. [COUGHING] Ladies. Enter. Ah, she's hot. It's the other one. I was just leaving. Does everybody you know know about this? Uh, you were the one filming it. Yeah, but not for public consumption. Please. I feel ya. You have Death Squad March? Yes. Are you serious? You freakin' play? Yes, every chance I get! Olivia, could we maybe play a game? Me and you could team up. You guys go ahead. Nah. Well, I mean, I was thinking if you ladies maybe wanna smoke a bowl... You know, it always helps to loosen me up-- You're the last person who needs loosening. I would be up for it. Not me! Wait. After all these years in Berkeley you still haven't tried it? No! Well, I mean, it's your call, but... All right, suck. All right, now move it away. Move it away. Hold your breath. Pretend to swallow-- That was interesting. See what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should go film now in the bedroom. You got it. [GIGGLING] Uh... [INDISTINCT] [LATIN MUSIC PLAYS] May I? Oh, that's embarrassing! Oh, you were doing fine. The guy I'm dating is a great dancer. I have white man's rhythm-- Oh, come on. I love the salsa. Heh. Yeah. It's all in the hips. Oh, how'd you get so good at this? I dated a salsa dancer myself. You know, I don't think I'm cut out for the gay lifestyle. Oh, you'll get there. It's not so hard. Here, it's all about the hair. That's right. Oh, thank you. You're a big help. Fabulous! Fabulous! So Olivia has been getting her degree for five years, she can't take two days off for her mama? Well, she, uh, has her reasons. That thing we did earlier was so mind-opening. God, a cataclysmic event-- I didn't expect you'd have such a strong reaction to it your first time. We are not talking about sex! It's that other thing. That thing that makes you really hungry. That's what we did. CJ: I am hungry, actually. Yeah! Let's eat! Absolutely! Let's go. Let's eat. Oh, no! Oh, no. You're not getting out of it that easy this time, Missy. VIDEO GAME: Prepare to die, Pissant. Playing with a guy's balls is the most important thing. And then focus on his lips. Role play. Put on hats. Slowly let him move downward. And maybe stroke it at the same time a little bit to get him hard. Doggie style, I like that. I like that. Hang on. Let's just do it right now. Let's get it done. You wanna just swallow it all in there. You want him to be like, "Oh, my God!" And then you ease it on down and jump on it! I guarantee you he's gonna nut in two seconds. If you wanna turn around and let him shower you, do it! Wrong drive. SHERRI: What was that? How to explain--ok. As you may know Olivia has some issues with her sexuality-- Well, yeah.She's still a virgin. Well, she's decided to try it with this guy Julian, his girlfriend's fine with it. And she's going to make a movie out of it? No wonder she didn't want to talk to me. This might help her. Are we rolling? Um, Olivia, look, you know, I don't understand why you're a virgin at 27 years of age. What are you thinking? What were you doing on Prom night? Everybody looses their virginity on Prom night. Are you insane? Why are you in gender studies? Do you think you're ever gonna get a job in gender studies? What is gender studies? What is it? What is it? I don't understand bi-sexual, homosexual, asexual, sexual anorexics, sexual, sexual this, sexual that, sexual-- identity shit. Olivia, everybody blames their mother, all right. All right, you hate me. I understand. Oh, wow. I look really good. That's great. This is the Arturo touch. You look at him. You look at him. And you wanna look at him from an angle like this. You get in there. You stick your vagina right in there, and you say eat that shit out motherfucker. Do you need anything else? Look, I feel like I'm rambling a little bit. Oh, that-- that is not appropriate. That is not--that is not even appropriate right now. Listen, Olivia. Right now I'm sure you're doing something and I hope you're not thinking about us. No. Don't think about us. And especially me. Especially not your mom. That's just weird. No! God, don't think about me. That's weird. Yeah, yeah. Don't be thinking about-- What do you think she's doing right now? [MOANING] Oh! Oh, that was amazing. [SIGHS] [GIGGLES] Oh, I was, uh-- I was just gonna use the restroom. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Have you ever noticed that when you're high your hands turn into these elfin, puppet-like creatures? Yeah, so did you do it? You mean technically, am I still a virgin? Yeah. Well, how do you define this thing virginity? CJ: What happened?! JULIAN: We didn't do it. [LAUGHING, CHATTER] Oh, my gosh. What an amazing weekend. Julian, I-- I am just amazed by you. You were so patient with me. Even with all of my craziness. Wow. I'm just amazed that you are actually still here. I didn't really have any other plans. And, CJ, you have gone above and beyond what any friend could have possibly been expected to do with this project. Thank you. Well, it was actually kind of interesting. Well, I'm obviously not gay so I hope you're not disappointed about that. Ahh...no! And, Julian, um, though I'm not sexually attracted to you right now, I will admit to a certain je ne sais quoi when it comes to, uh, the kiss we had on my porch. And, uh, though it doesn't make me want to have sex with you-- oh, my advisor's here! I have to go tell him about my newest accomplishment! Hey, I hope you don't take this personally. Naw. I think she has issues. Yeah, 'cause if she can't do it with you, there isn't a guy out there who's hot enough. Cool. I so wish I was a lesbian right now. Yeah, well, maybe in your next life. Yeah. Wow, that was weird. That was not my advisor. Oh, oh, my. We had fun dancing so-- Ah! You guys are the best friends ever. Thank you. Thank you, CJ. Julian. Um, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's going on here? It's kind of been building all weekend. But, CJ, you're gay! I--I think I might be bi. You should seriously look into that-- Wait, you--you're a betrayer is what you are! Well, you're the one who's been talking about exploring your sexuality all weekend. I can't believe that this is happening! Julian-- We're just talking. This is just friends talking. No hating. Maybe we should all just smoke another bowl-- You know, no. No. You know, I have been duped by you people! Ok? I have been completely open with you guys, and you both know everything about my pathetic little life, and you--this is how you repay me?! Uh, just keep the blanket. Can't we just talk about this? No. You know what, as a friend and as a camerawoman, you're fired! Olivia. CJ: Olivia! MAN: I mean, people think, like, oh, you know, my first time there's gonna be fireworks. It's gonna be amazing. No. It's not. You do it. You finish, and you move on. WOMAN: There was nothing magical about it. MAN 2: It was definitely awkward, but, you know, things have gotten smoother. I've worked out the kinks. MAN 3: I was 16. I was 15 years old. I was 17. I was 16 years old. I was 20. And... I was so nervous, I wore my favorite hat. It was Halloween. I was 16. And I was dressed as a girl. And I wasn't just dressed as a girl. I was dressed as a hooker. I actually was at this bar in New York, and, uh, I was sitting there, and I was really drunk. And I'd never kissed a girl ever. I lost my virginity to a 38-year-old woman, uh, at a truck stop in New Mexico. And she pulled me into the room, and I said, "What's going on?" And she came over and she, like, took off all her clothes and I was really really nervous. And she's, like, "I don't wanna make you uncomfortable." And I was like thinking in my head, "This is the best thing ever." It was actually--it happened when I was in high school. And it was more of a peer-pressure thing. MAN: I met somebody who sort of, I guess, tricked me into the ways of the world. WOMAN: After that, I knew that it wasn't right and I had the courage to be myself. And I think that, you know, it saved my life. [SIGHS] Grr! [PHONE RINGING] CJ: Hey. It's CJ. I haven't heard from you. Well, I'm turnin' in, so call me tomorrow. [PHONE RINGING] God damn it, CJ, leave me alone! Hey, it's Felisha-- Oh! Hi. I'm sorry. Sorry-- Uh. Is Julian around? I've been texting him for a while. Julian, uh, no. I think--I think he went out. Oh. So, uh, how's everything going? OLIVIA: Ok. You know things are going about as expected at the moment. I'll see you both tomorrow then. Yeah, uh, I may or may not be there. Oh? Yeah, I've just got a lot of things that I need to do. How's San Jose? It's fine. Um, Olivia? Yeah? Um, nothing. Never mind. Bye.OLIVIA: Bye. [CJ GIGGLING] JULIAN: Come see this. Touch it. CJ: What? No? You won't do that? [CJ LAUGHING] [CJ MOANING] JULIAN: Is that good? CJ: Yeah, definitely. I've only seen this in pornos. JULIAN: You're doing fine. You're doing really fine. CJ: Oh. Oh. Yea. Whoo. JULIAN: You wanna try being on top? CJ: I'm so glad I did this with you. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] Felisha. Hi. Hi. Wow. What a surprise. Is--is he asleep? Possibly, yes. Yes. Ok. Yes. He's asleep. I just felt like maybe I should come back early-- Yeah, I think maybe we should go outside because I'm having a really hard time hearing you. [CJ MOANS] I heard something.Oh, I didn't. What is going on? Nothing, nothing.Olivia. What is-- It's really tough to understand. Please. You really don't want to see this. No! [FELISHA GASPS] I'm so sorry, Felisha. The camerawoman?! Why is the camerawoman in the video?! JULIAN: Uhh... Please, put some clothes back on. This was not part of the deal! I'm so sorry, Felisha. They did this on their own-- JULIAN: Felisha? Felisha, let's all calm down-- I thought she was gay. I did too! You bitch. No, no, no, no. This is no one's fault. Ok, it might actually be yours. You seem bent on reaffirming the male philandering stereotype. How could you expect anything-- No. Do not blame him, ok. He was doing you a favor. You're all beautiful women. Things happen the way that they're supposed to. CJ, wait! I can't believe that I trusted you, and now Julian's in love? Yeah, clearly I'm a non-threat. No, that's not what I meant-- Of course it is! You think that you can reaffirm your relationship with your boyfriend by serving him up to a lesser partner-- No. Not true!Absolutely true. Just serve him up as a sexual sacrifice! No, I told you why, Olivia. It's because I-- it's because I cared about you as a friend. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] So the experiment has taken several unexpected turns, including the end of some relationships and the beginning of others none of which involve me. [SNIFFLES] [DOOR OPENS, LAUGHING] Get in there, sexy man. Get in there. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYS] I am danced out. I am done dancing. Oh. She's taking off her shoes. JAMES: Hey! Hey, no shoes in the house. No shoes. No shirts! No shirts in the house. SHERRI: No pants in the house. JAMES: No pants in the house. Hey hey! Ack. I'm being attacked. You have to be careful with-- [LAUGHING] Wait, is this uncomfortable for you? Oh, no. You know how many gals my age get to watch hot guy-on-guy sex? Statistically, none. So which one of you is the bottom? BOTH: He is. What is going on in here? Aah! Mother! What are you doing? We didn't know that you were up, Honey. We didn't know you'd be home. Yeah, well, I am. JAMES: Sorry, Olivia. Sorry. You don't look any different-- You told her?! What, so my life is an open book, an open joke? We all care about you. If you ever wanted to share-- Yeah, I would have told you myself. I wish. Ok, here it is. I'm still a fucking virgin, Mother! Oh, well, maybe it just wasn't meant to be-- You know, you can just save your feeble clichés for the morning. Oleo, I'm not going to be here in the morning. Oh? [TOILET FLUSHES] Well, here it is. I'm in love! Sher, still the free spirit. Oh, and just so darn open-minded! Um, Olivia, this is Dan. Dan, this is Olivia, my eldest. Ah, so nice to finally meet you. [GAGS] Whoa, how are you feeling? [SIGHS] Much better. Let me get you something to wear. Why is he not fully clothed? Because he barfed all over his shirt. Should I even bother asking who he is? Dan and I were college sweethearts. DAN: I remember it like it was yesterday. SHERRI: Oh, he always had a way with words! Please tell me that you didn't come up here to take up with this man. No! No. It was something where we wanted to see where it would go. It's just like old times. You have a husband! James, you can't just bring in random strangers and let them walk around half naked! And you wonder why she's still a virgin. You, out!Settle down! Now!Wait, wait wait wait. Let's all talk about this-- Just you and me, I will not share, ok? It's not worth the trouble. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] SHERRI: Oleo-- Mother, just go. Just go! Olivia?! For women like my mother, sex is simple. Sex is meant for people like them. As for me... I'm just going to take myself out of the game. This concludes the experiment. Um, Olivia... I just... I wanna tell you that I love you, and I... I don't know. I wanna say so many things to you. I just have so much in my heart that I want to say. And I just-- I just want you to be happy, sweetie, and, um... I'm sorry. [SIGHS] [DOOR SLAMS] Hi. Um...you... I was just outside. Me too. I tried to say something, but I didn't. Were you watching me? No, I just didn't want to startle you, like the other day. Great. Um... Well, next time maybe you can come by when I'm not in my pajamas. Ok. Um, but I just... you didn't say a time. At the bus stop. Oh, right! Uh, the drive, right. Let me go get James. And you, um... you can, um, wait in here, ok? Well, Ray Dingman is here, and I would also like to, um... apologize for being such a lunatic last night. I hope Arturo isn't too upset with everything that went down. We'll go to his place next time. Well, there won't be any need because, um... the experiment's over. There's no point. I, uh... I can't do it. That's why I was home last night. I'm just not made for... that. I feel like I let everybody down. No, you didn't. It's ok. It is. It's ok. It was an experiment. I know. Come here. Wait. You did say that Ray? He's here now? In the flesh. What does he want? Um, his top secret drive. I didn't see it yet. Maybe it's in the computer. Yes! Ok, here's the drive, um, excellent! Hi, Ray. James. Hey. Yes! Oh, no. That's not it. Yes, it is! Olivia, that's from your experiment. Where's mine? Um... CJ must have taken it! Who's CJ? Um, she's the camerawoman. I'll get it back to you. I will! Is this CJ, is she trustworthy? Yes, uh, yes! Um, I thought you said that it was password protected? It's not! It's not!! Oh, God. Ok, we need to get it back! I will get it back to you. I promise. I promise! So you wanna know the name of my car? Sure. It's Olivia. I was just kidding. It was a joke. [POP MUSIC PLAYS] ♪ Look at yourself ♪ Look at me, dear Oh! Thank you. ♪ How did we ♪ Become this, dear ♪ Why can't we learn ♪ To solve our trap ♪ You are left ♪ But behind I see black ♪ It's time against your back Hey. Hey. Hey. Julian. I need the memory card. I think I left it here. You're Julian? Yeah. Ray. Uh, about what happened last night you know we can work it out-- Maybe I should just wait out at the car No, I am sure that your memory card is here somewhere. Ok. Olivia, you know I, like, think you're attractive, right? Um, this is a little awkward. [GAME PLAYS IN BACKGROUND] Prepare to die, Pissant! I know that game. It's Death Squad March. Oh, yeah, well, so I was gonna say, maybe if you wanna try it again sometime, we could, but, it kinda looks like Ray here could probably just get it done. Could get it-- I don't follow. Um... The experiment? Well, I thought you two might be, like, going out. You two aren't going out anymore? Nah, we never went out. You know, chemistry is chemistry. You either have it or you don't. CJ: Julian? Ready to go again? Oh, yeah, I'll be right there! CJ's still here? Uh, yeah, I'm gonna go wait in the car. No, please! Please. Um... Hey! Yeah. I need the memory card from your camera. Oh! Yay! Here. Give me that. Oh! Oh! Sweet cherry! Did you look at this? Uh, no. Look, I wasn't this lesbian chick planning to mess around with the guy you were gonna do, ok? Gonna do? So you never did do? Uh, other things got in the way. I really did think I was gay, all right? Ok, it's fine, CJ. It's fine. I'm really not a bad person. Yeah, I believe you. Yeah, great. So now that we have our mission accomplished, we're gonna go. So... Yeah. Um, CJ, have fun with the brain dead zombie. Come again? Level 8, Death Squad March? Maybe you haven't gotten that far. Are you starting something? No, he's not. Come on. Let's go. JULIAN: I didn't even know there was a Level 8. Ray, I'm really sorry about your drive. I hope I didn't compromise any valuable information. To be honest, there wasn't anything work-related on the drive. I thought you said something about the Defense Department, and-- Yeah, I did say that. Um... Why would you lie about something like that? I had a good reason. Well, usually I'm quite reliable about these kinds of things, but... Would your experiment have something to do with that? Yes. I just can't talk about it. Shall we?

OLIVIA: Oh, actually, my apartment's back the other way. RAY: I know. I just need to make a quick detour, if that's ok. OLIVIA: Sure. So what are we doing? Oh. This is Tilden Park. I come here every morning. I like the sundial and the view. You ever been up here? No. I didn't even ask you if this was ok. No, it's fine. It's beautiful. Cool. So come here, you gotta see this. See? Oh, wow. Yeah. So what was on that drive? There was this bet. What kind of bet? This could be a date. Is this a date? Um... You didn't answer my question. A dating bet. Now I'm a little lost. Now you didn't answer my question. Ok, fine, yes, this is a date. Good. Ok, so James and I, um, we weren't getting out very much. So we made a bet, a dating bet. And, um, if I lost I had to provide him with some pictures. Because there was this discussion about the men in our department and who had, based on quality and size, and rumor was I had. So the big-- this is embarrassing. I feel like I'm freaking you out. No, I, um. I would never allow such information to color my opinion of you. I didn't think you would. So what's the experiment? Yeah. Um... It was just this crazy decision that was born out of desperation. Desperation? You? Yeah. Is that so hard to believe? Yes, actually it is. Why? I don't know if you've noticed, but, I mean... Olivia, I turn into a nervous wreck when I'm around you. I mean, look, you have so much going on for yourself, obviously. [CHUCKLES] Well, your definition of obvious escapes most everyone else. Well, maybe if you went out with people who appreciated you, that wouldn't be a problem. Plus, I wasn't really interested in sex or any of that stuff. Every legitimate experiment has a conclusion, and so it follows logically, this experiment may not be entirely legitimate. However, a gray zone isn't always a terrible place in which to be. [POP MUSIC PLAYS]
