Tanguy! Do you know the story of Tanguy? Tanguy and the wild boys? Captain... Captain. Tanguy had not always been like this. I mean a boy with one breast on a lost island. Before being a boy-almost-girl, I was a boy. A wild and violent boy. I was part of a club, together for better, but mostly for worst. Toad, that under cold stone... They were rich, defiant, uninhibited, and in love with their literature teacher, believing naively it was reciprocal. We all wanted to be actors. One fateful Sunday, we put on a show. They drank to fortify their courage, far too much. Fillet of a fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake... I conjure you, by that which you profess, answer me. Speak. Demand. Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths, or from our masters? Call'em. Let me see'em. Cool it with a baboon's blood, Then the charm is firm and good. Cool it with a baboon's blood, Then the charm is firm and good... Not like this! You've ruined everything! You're out of control. We're stopping. Next act... Let go of me! This is when it all went bad. We wanted to go to the end of the act, without considering the consequences, we wanted to impress her. This state of trance was familiar to us, as if we had become one with our masks. One violent, unpredictable being. It was impossible for us to resist this impulse, we called... TREVOR The chasm, the chasm! We killed her? TREVOR did it. Not us. She asked us to tie her up. Understand? One thing is clear. They were sincerely sad and ashamed. It was an accident. There was a simulacrum of a trial where we lied wonderfully. And with remorse, of course. By chance, Romuald spoke first. He was the least convincing of the club. She invited us to play a scene from Macbeth. Initially, she made us drink a lot of rum. She said... it would improve our acting, we would be more relaxed. So... we did what she said. Then it was Hubert's turn, the most secretive of us. She called us into a room one after the other. I was the first. I was drunk, my head was spinning. She asked me if I was alright. And put her hand between my legs. She said, how you've grown. She made me drink more. Sloan was young and the sweetest amongst us. She asked me to follow her and undressed me in the room. She wanted to see my naked body. I was too drunk to resist. It's hard to say, She masturbated me for a long while. After, she opened her mouth... She said, give me drink, my darling. I thirst for youth. Jean-Louis was profoundly cruel. A curious mixture of acid and milk. Then she slapped me. For nothing, because... I didn't want to tie her to the horse. She humiliated us. She said we were good for nothing. Finally... we tied her down. I remember her laughing loudly while pissing. It ran down her legs and onto the horse. It was horrible. The horse took fright and fled. It disappeared. There you have it. As for Tanguy, he got off the hook like always by fleeing. I don't remember a thing. I was too drunk. She forced us to drink, that I remember. The others told me the rest after. That's all I can say, truly. You must believe me. Believe! Believe? Their story is indeed very convincing, and damning for Ms Lorna Debougainville who took these boys under her wing. Unfortunately, there are no other witnesses. We must content ourselves with this scabrous version of the facts. Five boys led astray by a perverse woman of little decency and moral value. With your permission, let me enumerate the past exploits of these innocent actors before you deliberate. Public drunkenness, blasphemous graffiti, insult to Faculty, brawls, repeated attendance of brothels, numerous expulsions from various schools for verbal abuse, and so on. I will pass on the abuse of domestic help and inappropriate gestures. But of course none of this matters. I believe that this is why we must dissolve this band of individuals. Or discipline them in the most firm of manners, for they are all but innocent. They were separated the time to find an efficient and exemplary solution. They were reunited the day their rich families called upon a Dutchman named The Captain. It's serious this time boys. Who is this guy? The Captain was accompanied by a boy on a leash, a tantalizing girl, a grouchy dog and a load of hairy fruit. At any rate, if the girl's included... They will never forget the first time they laid eyes on him. The boys were forced to eat the fruit without any explanation. Who could have thought that this boy, who savagely raped three young women and set fire to a school, had become a docile, singing lamb. The Captain has his eye on you. Soon you'll be singing like a little nightingale. Bring on The Captain. What is he, a pervert? The Captain is hard but fair. You can tell us, is it an act? Not at all. He taught me to be gentle, non violent. A slave with a leash like a dog. I was a dog before. You want some? I don't drink. That's a mistake, mister. No vices then? Yes. The arts. Like us. Devoted to pleasure and the arts. Who's the girl with you? The Captain's daughter. Will she come with us? Yes. I'm leaving right now. Me too. I imagine you can fight back? No. You're a coward then? No. Stop, Jean-Louis. What do you have to prove? Lick. Show us you're a nice boy. I can't do that. Stop. He didn't do anything. Lick. I'll show you it's a lie. You don't understand. I'm a civilized being. Civilized? You're a dishrag. He's become mad. Stop laughing cretin! I can transform any violent boy into a civilized and docile being. Why imprison? They are erudite at will, but they are barbarians. How do you proceed? It's a bit vague. Two months at sea without a crew. Only the dog, my daughter and me. A special diet, no animal flesh. I have my ways. I can guarantee you it works every time. Yet he could not guarantee that each boy would survive the trip. The parents accepted this risk. They had no shame. Except for Tanguy's mother who preferred to keep him near. You won't believe me, but we five shared the same dream that same night. You think I'd leave you, dick flapping in the wind? Mother let you fly away? I took the initiative. The Captain's still not here. We can't get in. This is bullshit. But his daughter will get wet with us. We could take care of her sea urchin. The Captain can take his sweet time because I... Evening Captain, how are you? You, smart ass, cast off. There's one too many. You, disembark. My mother changed her mind. Should have paid. Divide your four rations by five. We left the Isle of Bourbon in the rain, without tears nor regrets. I felt strangely relieved. The dirty pervert will have us die a slow death. I want to go. I'm too cold. Keep a low profile. TREVOR will awaken and We'll kill him. And drink rum from his daughter's ass. Shakespeare! That was not part of the deal! We're tied up like dogs. It's for safety reasons. I don't want you to fall into the sea. We can swim. We're not dogs. You're pedantic little bourgeois. From now on, you will become one with the ship. You will work for her. Move, breathe, live for her. Captain, is your daughter tied up also? I've less of a daughter than you've hair on your chin. But the girl with you? Were we dreaming? Bait for virgins. A problem young man? You have no right to strangle us, or deprive us of our books. The one who needs to read can come see me. You, Turtleface get a bucket and wash the deck. You, Foetus, put the bags in the hold. You, Precious, align the rope on the bow. And you, Idiot-of-the-gang, stay with me and learn to take the helm. And me? You, Girly... sing us a song. A soft one. Make the most of life, the sun, and sing! I need relief, let me piss. Let me piss! Never let go of the helm. Whatever happens, never let go. Understand? The knife stays here. If you touch it I'll plant it in your foot. The first days were the most strenuous. The Captain was without mercy. Pulling their ropes with ardor. They focused on the tasks at hand, tried to put on a good show. Their only worry was that The Captain would unexpectedly strangle them. We must rebel. We must rebel, do you hear me? Tanguy's right. Let's start by doing what The Captain asks us. You're a coward. You're all cowards. Come on! Put your back into it! The sail is covered with your predecessors' hair to remind you you're not the first nor the last on this boat. That's how The Captain put us down, my friends. What are you looking at degenerate? Nothing. Nothing. Liar. You have your eye on my prick. You want to see it? No thank you. Don't be prude, take a look. It's been around. Here, a girl I met in Sumatra. The bite mark of a crazy woman. Here, the latitude and longitude of a cherished island. So you see, Turtleface, if you want something to read, come and see me. You're the least twisted of the gang, I feel it. If ever something's scheming behind my back, I'm counting on you. Yes Sir. Die! Loupia... my beauty. Jean-Louis avenged us in his way. Curiously, at that precise moment we shared the same desire... TREVOR helped me. To be The Captain's dog. You're the most courageous, Jean-Louis, truly. He... attacked me in the middle of the night. He had your face and I was frightened. He got caught in the rope. I jumped, he followed. It was neither the time nor the place, but they were fascinated by his anatomy. From that day on, The Captain barely spoke. The boys spent many days in the dark hold, eating acrid, hairy fruit, drinking little water, shitting in a pail. Feverish and prone to the worst visions. At the Captain's mercy. I can barely manage to eat this nasty, hairy fruit. My ideals have gone. How can one live without ideals? Getting hard, drinking, creating, blaspheming. It's all over. TREVORS dead. TREVOR left us. Why don't you speak Hubert? Why don't you speak anymore? My thoughts are with The Captain. I hear him walking on deck. I feel him breathing. I imagine him close. He opens the hold. The deliverance was even more sudden than the punishment. They hoisted themselves on deck. The salty sun embraced their eyes. We've returned? Captain? No idiot, port of call. Their ordeal was far from over. A new rope tied them to The Captain, invisible, solid and tight. They happily regained the comfort of dry land, but not without alarm. The island resembled nothing they knew. An ungracious mountain covered with luxurious and malodorous vegetation. A black turd covered with moss. It reeks of oyster. Where are we Captain? Nowhere. Cover your eyes with this. Quickly. Not you, you'll close the line. Hold the rope to follow me. Something licked me! Me too. Forward, in silence. We're going to cross a field of groping grass. Move quickly. This island was most strange. The vegetation seemed alive, the fields striking, sucking, biting and this pungent smell of oysters. They were like dwarves on a giant dirty girl. Describe what you see. There are big ferns. Enormous mushrooms that look like asses. Cool. Hubert, traitor. Advance, no stopping. It's disgusting. Hurry. Take off the blindfolds. If you're thirsty... If you're hungry... If you're tense... Take advantage of the pleasures. Stay here until I return. Do you hear me? Stay here. The island is very dangerous. I don't know what to think of all of this. So, Huben? You're not going to taste? The Captain's your friend, isn't he? It's divine. Pleasures were unlimited on the island. They tried not understand why The Captain brought them to such a place. Was it their feverish delirium or reality? Where are you off to Hubert? To take a piss. Hubert was following his member, but not to take a piss. He longed for The Captain. Later, Hubert would tell them his adventure. The Captain's breast poking through his shirt, and more importantly, meeting S?verine. Doctor S?verin's method will be emulated. I brought enough to drink, eat and smoke. Books, wigs, dresses, S?verine. S?verin, I already told you. Put the dress over your black breast, and the wig up your ass. Open the bottles. Let's drink a little. While Hubert drank in The Captain with his eyes, the boys, deeply satisfied, languished in the heart of the island. Yes, we were drunk, incapable of moving, embalmed in our shit dreams, at the mercy of our most heinous visions. Fill all the bags with hairy fruit. You have five minutes. Hubert's not here. He must have gotten lost pissing. Too bad for him. Fill the bags, we're leaving. Why? It's paradise here. You've made the most of it. Hurry! We could stay here. This place is amazing. We can refuse to board. He doesn't make the rules here. What do you say? Hubert! Hey Friday. You're stuck like a fly. I can't breathe. Help me. I should kill you Friday. Hubert! Hubert! I'm Hubert. Indeed. Need to urinate Friday? No. Answer honestly. Do you need to piss? Yes. Well piss on yourself. What are you waiting for? Stop barking and move. Hubert! I don't believe I'll kill you Friday. If only to anger William. The Captain! He's no more of a captain than I'm a woman. Are you looking at my breasts? They've made me exceptional. What do you see? A woman. You are taken in by appearances. Hubert told them that S?verine became like a father for him. Yet, The Captain had nothing of a mother. No rebellion will be tolerated. Upon our return, I will report you. Tell how you abandoned Hubert. You will be locked up. The return is far. Hubert died falling from a cliff, his own fault and stupidity. Now, we will depart rapidly. If one of you refuses, cross this line. Come on. Sloane. Clearly. Romuald. You too? You're just going to obey like that? No. You're going too? Tanguy?? Leave me here, go! Come on! Cowards. Welcome aboard Girly. Thank you Captain. We thought of Hubert, alone on the island. We felt ashamed. They left you, you see. You can count on no one. Be weary of the black peaches. The Captain makes us eat them constantly. That does not surprise me. He is missing stature and natural authority. Tell me. Do you and your club believe in God? No. You all seem very charming. It smells like a storm. It smells like oysters. We are on an oyster. Enormous. And I am its pearl. Dinner! The fruits! The fruits! You'll eat later. I'm starving! Stop whining. You, Girly, take down the sail, the wind is rising. The others, hunker down and pray! On the boat, The Captain did not tie them up. It was his only mistake. Captain! Captain! Captain! I love you, Captain! Shut up dimwit! Don't move or I'll kill you. You think you scare me? Fucking Captain! You think you scare me? Did you see how we got him? How I got him? Say I'm TREVOR! Say it! We're going to pierce your heart! We have him, Tanguy! Stay still! I said stay still. But what's this? What's this? It's Black Titty! The Terrible Captain. We will rid you of this foul thing, unless you bring us back to the island. You've hid it well, Captain, this wonderful tit. Let go of me, bunch of idiots! The boat's going to tip... These were the last words of our dear Captain. How can we reach the island now? Don't let go of the helm. We're free! Free! It was before the seeds of our destiny sprouted. We thought ourselves immortal. We had one idea in mind... To return to the island of pleasure. It's nothing. A drop of rain. We'll be able to pay back our dear parents. The island! The island! Look what I found. We have to find Hubert. Tomorrow. I'm beat. Did you find the munitions? Yes, but no weapons. To our survival! We can get drunk as lords. They celebrated their regained freedom until dawn. It was like a premonitory hallucination. Salty and sweet, hard and yielding. The most beautiful of hallucinations. The most beautiful of hallucinations. Salty and sweet, hard and yielding. Hubert'? Hubert! Not so clever now, Captain? He's dead and rotten. I heard a woman's cry. It's me... He has a girl's voice. I saw Hubert. You must have hallucinated Girly. Like last night. We have to find Hubert. If he was here, he'll return. The Captain was back, wanting to speak to us, to warn us of the island. Now that The Captain is dead, I can take on my new role. Listen, Girly, go find Hubert if you want, but we're staying here for the moment. Right, Romuald? We're all going to find him. Unless you're scared of the island. Not at all. Let's divide up! Courage on one side. Pleasure on the other. Goodbye! Bye! Look at the cliff. The cliff! So what? It looks like The Captain. Not at all. Tanguy?? Yes. I've grown breasts. What are you doing? Looking to see if it's true. What's happening to us Tanguy? I don't know. It's not true... What were you looking for? They haven't returned? They must have died gobbled up by the island. We can't leave the beach. We should've listened to The Captain. He gave it to you hard, is that what you regret cretin? I regret everything I've done since I met you. Never repeat that. Never. What is that? What have you got there? Leave me alone! What are you hiding from me? Nothing! Leave me alone. He's become a girl! A girl with tits and a little pussy. So what, I don't see what's funny? Come on, give us a better look. Stop! Not bad. See how beautiful she is boys? Come on, don't be shy. You know what, I'm hard. We should celebrate this. Stop! Just a visit. Between friends, it's fine. You want me. Say it, Romuald. Say it. Shit. What? You gobbled my dick. My dick. A new perspective opens to you. What will you do with your dick? What should I do with it, bury it with dignity, at The Captain's feet. It's no use. I don't want to die. Not like this. Who said we're going to die? Piss on yourselves. For now, Tanguy only had one. Everything led to believe a second one was coming. So you only have one breast? You ate fruit like the others? Yes. Curious, something resists in you. Leave me alone. Things will get better for us. Why, were they bad before? You can't stay like this. He reminds me of William, clinging on to the islet of his virility like a crab. You were the first to cry when you changed, Sloane. I know. But now I like it. There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. You don't want to become a woman? Do I have a choice? Just answer. I'm a boy, not a girl. Look how they are beautiful. With their round little asses and their buoyant breasts. They were superb. Tanguy was suddenly taken by a feeling of injustice. Even though he strongly wished for it his body refused to become a woman. The island is an oyster. Enormous. Covered with amphibious vegetation. The ancient mariners called it Dress Island for its ability to transform men into women. It is uncharted. Doctor S?verin told of how he discovered the island following his research on hormonal plants. Told of how he became a woman, understood too late the dosage of the fruit, and convinced The Captain to perfect a method to tame wild boys. He told them all of this, in the most simple manner. He believed a feminized world would stop war and conflict. The Captain's metamorphosis stopped miraculously. Her words soothed them. Hubert drank in every word. I stayed on the island. I did not want to confront the world like this. I perfected a scientific dosage in order to modify behaviour. I became one with the island, which revealed to me its ancient secrets. In the night, it sings: Future is woman Future is sorceress Their reunion was distant and cold. Jean-Louis was even more troubling like this. So Tanguy always as timid? The Captain was at his service. He was his pawn. So it's thanks to you we were beaten and so on? The doctor didn't know that The Captain... Hubert told me all about you. I was... overcome. The Doctor is incredible. How so? What is so incredible? What is that fire for, girls? We saw a ship's lights. We'll leave this rotten island. Have you thought about what you're doing? Tanguy was not ready. I was not ready. Are you sure you want to confront the world like this? He was not ready to leave the island... to confront the world. And once more, my friends, he fled. Tanguy! Tanguy! Tanguy! Tanguy! Leave him. He wants to become a woman. He doesn't trust the in-between. What do we do then? If leaving is your choice, leave. But all together. Like a conquering army. We are hallucinating once again. You want it? Take it. You like power? Take it. If I kill you now, what do you say, Doctor? Men must endure their going hence even as their coming hither. Ripeness is all. Do you want me to come with you Jean-Louis? Welcome to the club. The bullets are still in my belly. Do you want them? The rest, you remember. The dog. The sailors that come ashore. The sailors that explore. Tanguy! We will come back. We will come back to find you when you become a woman, if ever one day you become one. And hope to joy)' is little less in joy. And if he cannot become a woman... I will become Captain. THE WILD BOYS Toad, that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty-one Swelter'd venom sleeping got, Boil thou first I' the charmed pot Silver'd in the moon's eclipse, Nose of Turc and Tartar's lips Fillet of a fenny snake, In the caldron boil and bake If I have a piece of advice to give you, ladies, never be vulgar.
