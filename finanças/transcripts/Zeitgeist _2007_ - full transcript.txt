Spirituality is a particular term which actually means: a dealing with intuition. In the theistic tradition there is a notion of clinging into a word. A certain act is regarded as displeasing to a divine principle... A certain act is regarded as pleasing for the divine... whatever. In the tradition of non-theism, however, it is very direct... that the case histories are not particularly important. What is actually important is Here and Now. Now is definitely now. We try to experience what is available there... on the spot. There is no point in thinking that a past did exist that we could have now. This is now. This very moment. Nothing mystical, just 'Now', very simple, straightforward. And from that Now-ness, however, arises a sense of intelligence always that you are constantly interacting with reality one by one. Spot by spot. Constantly. We actually experience fantastic precision, always. But we are threatened by the Now so we jump to the past or the future. Paying attention to the materials that exist in our life... all these choices take place all the time... but none of them are regarded as bad or good per se. Everything we experience are unconditional experiences. They don't come along with a label saying 'this is regarded as bad' or 'this is good'. But we experience them but we don't actually pay heed to them properly. We don't actually regard that we are going somewhere. We regard that as a hassle. Waiting to be dead. Waiting to be dead. That is a problem. That is not trusting the Now-ness properly; that what is actually experienced Now possesses a lot of powerful things. It is so powerful that we can't face it. Therefore, we have to borrow from the past and invite the future all the time. And maybe that's why we seek religion. Maybe that's why we march in the street. Maybe that's why we complain to society. Maybe that's why we vote for the presidents. It is quite ironical... Very funny indeed. The more you begin to investigate... What we think we understand, where we came from, what we think we're doing, the more you begin to see we've been lied to. We've been lied to by every institution. What makes you think for one minute that the religious institution is the only one that's never been touched? The religious institutions of this world are at the bottom of the dirt. The religious institutions in this world are put there by the same people who gave you your government, your corrupt education, who set up your international banking cartels. We have been misled away from the true and divine presence in the universe that men have called God. I don't know what God is but I know what he isn't, and unless and until you are prepared to look at the whole truth, and wherever it may go, whoever it may lead to, The more you educate yourself, the more you understand where things come from the more obvious things become and you begin to see lies everywhere. You have to know the truth and seek the truth and the truth will set you free. Because I gotta tell you the truth, folks, I gotta tell you the truth. When it comes to bullshit, big-time, major league bullshit, you have to stand in awe, of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims-- Religion. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and he needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, you talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit! This is the sun. As far back as 10 thousand B.C., history is abundant with carvings and writings reflecting peoples respect and adoration for this object. And it is simple to understand why as every morning the sun would rise, bringing vision, warmth, and security, saving man from the cold, blind, predator-filled darkness of night. Without it, the cultures understood the crops would not grow, and life on the planet would not survive. These realities made the sun the most adored object of all time. Likewise, they were also very aware of the stars. The tracking of the stars allowed them to recognize and anticipate events which occurred over long periods of time, such as eclipses and full moons. They in turn catalogued celestial groups into what we know today as constellations. This is the cross of the Zodiac, one of the oldest conceptual images in human history. It reflects the sun as it figuratively passes through the 12 major constellations over the course of a year. It also reflects the 12 months of the year, the 4 seasons, and the solstices and equinoxes. The term Zodiac relates to the fact that constellations were anthropomorphized, or personified, as figures, or animals. In other words, the early civilizations did not just follow the sun and stars, they personified them with elaborate myths involving their movements and relationships. The sun, with its life-giving and life-saving qualities was personified as a representative of the unseen creator, or God. "God's Sun," the light of the world, the savior of human kind. Likewise, the 12 constellations represented places of travel for God's Sun and were identified by names, usually representing elements of nature that happened during that period of time. For example, Aquarius, the water bearer, who brings the Spring rains. This is Horus. He is the Sun God of Egypt of around 3000 BC. He is the sun, anthropomorphized, and his life is a series of allegorical myths involving the sun's movement in the sky. From the ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt, we know much about this solar messiah. For instance, Horus, being the sun, or the light, had an enemy known as Set, and Set was the personification of the darkness or night. And metaphorically speaking, every morning Horus would win the battle against Set; while in the evening, Set would conquer Horus and send him into the underworld. It is important to note that "dark vs. light" or "good vs. evil" is one of the most ubiquitous mythological dualities ever known and is still expressed on many levels to this day. Broadly speaking, the story of Horus is as follows: Horus was born on December 25th of the virgin Isis-Meri. His birth was accompanied by a star in the east, and upon his birth, he was adored by three kings. At the age of 12, he was a prodigal child teacher, and at the age of 30 he was baptized by a figure known as Anup and thus began his ministry. Horus had 12 disciples he traveled about with, performing miracles such as healing the sick and walking on water. Horus was known by many gestural names such as The Truth, The Light, God's Anointed Son, The Good Shepherd, The Lamb of God, and many others. After being betrayed by Typhon, Horus was crucified, buried for 3 days, and thus, resurrected. These attributes of Horus, whether original or not, seem to permeate in many cultures of the world, for many other Gods are found to have the same general mythological structure. Attis, of Phrygia, born of the virgin Nana on December 25th, crucified, placed in a tomb and after 3 days, was resurrected. Krishna, of India, born of the virgin Devaki with a star in the east signaling his coming, he performed miracles with his disciples, and upon his death was resurrected. Dionysus of Greece, born of a virgin on December 25th, was a traveling teacher who performed miracles such as turning water into wine, he was referred to as the "King of Kings," "God's Only Begotten Son," "The Alpha and Omega," and many others, and upon his death, he was resurrected. Mithra, of Persia, born of a virgin on December 25th, he had 12 disciples and performed miracles, and upon his death was buried for 3 days and thus resurrected, he was also referred to as "The Truth," "The Light," and many others. Interestingly, the sacred day of worship of Mithra was Sunday. The fact of the matter is there are numerous saviors, from different periods, from all over the world, which subscribe to these general characteristics. The question remains: Why these attributes, why the virgin birth on December 25th, why dead for three days and the inevitable resurrection, why 12 disciples or followers? To find out, let's examine the most recent of the solar messiahs. Jesus Christ was born of the virgin Mary on December 25th in Bethlehem, his birth was announced by a star in the east, which three kings or magi followed to locate and adore the new savior. He was a child teacher at 12, at the age of 30 he was baptized by John the Baptist, and thus began his ministry. Jesus had 12 disciples which he traveled about with performing miracles such as healing the sick, walking on water, raising the dead, he was also known as the "King of Kings," the "Son of God," the "Light of the World," the "Alpha and Omega," the "Lamb of God," and many others. After being betrayed by his disciple Judas and sold for 30 pieces of silver, he was crucified, placed in a tomb and after 3 days was resurrected and ascended into Heaven. First of all, the birth sequence is completely astrological. The star in the east is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, which, on December 24, aligns with the 3 brightest stars in Orion's Belt. These 3 bright stars are called today what they were called in ancient times: The Three Kings. And the Three Kings and the brightest star, Sirius, all point to the place of the sunrise on December 25th. This is why the Three Kings "follow" the star in the east, in order to locate the sunrise... the birth of the sun. The Virgin Mary is the constellation Virgo, also known as Virgo the Virgin. Virgo in Latin means virgin. Virgo is also referred to as the House of Bread, and the representation of Virgo is a virgin holding a sheaf of wheat. This House of Bread and its symbol of wheat represents August and September, the time of harvest. In turn, Bethlehem, in fact, literally translates to "house of bread". Bethlehem is thus a reference to the constellation Virgo, a place in the sky, not on Earth. There is another very interesting phenomenon that occurs around December 25th, or the winter solstice. From the summer solstice to the winter solstice, the days become shorter and colder. And from the perspective of the northern hemisphere, the sun appears to move south and get smaller and more scarce. The shortening of the days and the expiration of the crops when approaching the winter solstice symbolized the process of death to the ancients. It was the death of the Sun. And by December 22nd, the Sun's demise was fully realized, for the Sun, having moved south continually for 6 months, makes it to it's lowest point in the sky. Here a curious thing occurs: The Sun stops moving south, at least perceivably, for 3 days. And during this 3 day pause, the Sun resides in the vicinity of the Southern Cross, or Crux, constellation. And after this time on December 25th, the Sun moves 1 degree, this time north, foreshadowing longer days, warmth, and Spring. And thus it was said: the Sun died on the cross, was dead for 3 days, only to be resurrected or born again. This is why Jesus and numerous other Sun Gods share the crucifixion, 3-day death, and resurrection concept. It is the Sun's transition period before it shifts its direction back into the Northern Hemisphere, bringing Spring, and thus salvation. However, they did not celebrate the resurrection of the Sun until the spring equinox, or Easter. This is because at the spring equinox, the Sun officially overpowers the evil darkness, as daytime thereafter becomes longer in duration than the night, and the revitalizing conditions of spring emerge. Now, probably the most obvious of all the astrological symbolism around Jesus regards the 12 disciples. They are simply the 12 constellations of the Zodiac, which Jesus, being the Sun, travels about with. In fact, the number 12 is replete throughout the Bible. Coming back to the cross of the Zodiac, the figurative life of the Sun, this was not just an artistic expression or tool to track the Sun's movements. It was also a Pagan spiritual symbol, the shorthand of which looked like this. This is not a symbol of Christianity. It is a Pagan adaptation of the cross of the Zodiac. This is why Jesus in early occult art is always shown with his head on the cross, for Jesus is the Sun, the "Sun of God", the "Light of the World", the "Risen Savior", who will "come again," as it does every morning, the "Glory of God" who defends against the "works of darkness", as he is "born again" every morning, and can be seen "coming in the clouds," "up in Heaven," with his "Crown of Thorns," or sun rays. Now, of the many astrological-astronomical metaphors in the Bible, one of the most important has to do with the ages. Throughout the scripture there are numerous references to the "Age." In order to understand this, we need to be familiar with the phenomenon known as the Precession of the Equinoxes. The ancient Egyptians along with cultures long before them recognized that approximately every 2150 years, the sunrise on the morning of the spring equinox would occur at a different sign of the Zodiac. This has to do with a slow angular wobble that the Earth maintains as it rotates on it's axis. It is called a precession because the constellations go backwards, rather than through the normal yearly cycle. The amount of time that it takes for the precession to go through all 12 signs is roughly 25,765 years. This is also called the "Great Year," and ancient societies were very aware of this. And they referred to each 2150 year period as an "age." From 4300 B.C. to 2150 B.C., it was the Age of Taurus, the Bull. From 2150 BC to 1 AD., it was the Age of Aries, the Ram and from 1 AD. to 2150 AD. it is the Age of Pisces, the age we are still in to this day. And in and around 2150, we will enter the new age. The Age of Aquarius. Now, the Bible reflects, broadly speaking, a symbolic movement through 3 ages, while foreshadowing a 4th. In the Old Testament, when Moses comes down Mount Sinai with the 10 Commandments, he is very upset to see his people worshiping a golden bull calf. In fact, he shattered the stone tablets and instructed his people to kill each other in order to purify themselves. Most Biblical scholars would attribute this anger to the fact that the Israelites were worshiping a false idol, or something to that effect. The reality is that the golden bull is Taurus the Bull, and Moses represents the new Age of Aries the Ram. This is why Jews even today still blow the Ram's horn. Moses represents the new Age of Aries, and upon the new age, everyone must shed the old age. Other deities mark these transitions as well, such as Mithra a pre-Christian God who kills the bull, in the same symbology. Now Jesus is the figure who ushers in the age following Aries, the Age of Pisces, or the Two Fish. Fish symbolism is very abundant in the New Testament, as Jesus feeds 5000 people with bread and "2 fish." When he begins his ministry walking along Galilee, he befriends 2 fishermen, who follow him. And I think we've all seen the Jesus-fish on the backs of people's cars. Little do they know what it actually means. It is a Pagan astrological symbolism for the Sun's Kingdom during the Age of Pisces. Also, Jesus' assumed birth date is essentially the start of this age. At Luke 22:10 when Jesus is asked by his disciples where the last passover would be, Jesus replies: "Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water... follow him into the house where he entereth in." This scripture is by far one of the most revealing of all the astrological references. The man bearing a pitcher of water is Aquarius, the water-bearer, who is always pictured as a man pouring out a pitcher of water. He represents the age after Pisces, and when the Sun (God's Sun) leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus), it will go into the House of Aquarius, as Aquarius follows Pisces in the precession of the equinoxes. All Jesus is saying is that after the Age of Pisces will come the Age of Aquarius. Now, we have all heard about the end times and the end of the world. The cartoonish depictions in the Book of Revelation, the main source of this idea comes from Matthew 28:20, where Jesus says: "I will be with you even to the end of the world." However, in King James Version, "world" is a mistranslation, among many mistranslations. The actual word being used is "aeon", which means "age." "I will be with you even to the end of the age." Which is true, as Jesus' Solar Piscean personification will end when the Sun enters the Age of Aquarius. The entire concept of end times and the end of the world is a misinterpreted astrological allegory. Let's tell that to the approximately 100 million people in America who believe the end of the world is coming. Furthermore, the character of Jesus, being a literary and astrological hybrid, is most explicitly a plagiarization of the Egyptian Sun-God Horus. For example, inscribed about 3500 years ago, on the walls of the Temple of Luxor in Egypt are images of the enunciation, the miracle conception, the birth, and the adoration of Horus. The images begin with Thaw announcing to the virgin Isis that she will conceive Horus, then Nef the holy ghost impregnating the virgin, and then the virgin birth and the adoration. This is exactly the story of Jesus' miracle conception. In fact, the literary similarities between the Egyptian religion and the Christian religion are staggering. And the plagiarism is continuous. The story of Noah and Noah's Ark is taken directly from tradition. The concept of a Great Flood is ubiquitous throughout the ancient world, with over 200 different cited claims in different periods and times. However, one need look no further for a pre-Christian source than the Epic of Gilgamesh written in 2600 B.C. This story talks of a Great Flood commanded by God, an Ark with saved animals upon it, and even the release and return of a dove, all held in common with the biblical story, among many other similarities. And then there is the plagiarized story of Moses. Upon Moses' birth, it is said that he was placed in a reed basket and set adrift in a river in order to avoid infanticide. He was later rescued by a daughter of royalty and raised by her as a Prince. This baby in a basket story was lifted directly from the myth of Sargon of Akkad, of around 2250 B.C. Sargon was born, placed in a reed basket, in order to avoid infanticide, and set adrift in a river. He was in turn rescued and raised by Akki, a royal mid-wife. Furthermore, Moses is known as the Law Giver, the giver of the Ten Commandments, the Mosaic Law. However, the idea of a Law being passed from God to a prophet, up on a mountain, is also a very old motif. Moses is just a law giver in a long line of law givers in mythological history. In India, Manou was the great law giver. In Crete, Minos ascended Mount Dicta, where Zeus gave him the sacred laws. While in Egypt there was Mises, who carried stone tablets and upon them, the laws of God were written. Manou, Minos, Mises, Moses. And as far as the Ten Commandments, they are taken outright from Spell 125 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. What the Book of the Dead phrased "I have not stolen" became "Thou shall not steal," "I have not killed" became "Thou shall not kill," "I have not told lies" became "Thou shall not bare false witness", and so forth. In fact, the Egyptian religion is likely the primary foundational basis for the Judeo-Christian theology. Baptism, afterlife, final judgement, virgin birth, death and resurrection, crucifixion, the ark of the covenant, circumcision, saviors, holy communion, the great flood, Easter, Christmas, Passover, and many many more, are all attributes of Egyptian ideas, long pre-dating Christianity and Judaism. Justin Martyr, one of the first Christian historians and defenders, wrote: "When we say that he, Jesus Christ, our teacher, was produced without sexual union, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into Heaven, we propound nothing different from what you believe regarding those who you esteem Sons of Jupiter." In a different writing, Justin Martyr said: "He was born of a virgin, accept this in common, with what you believe of Perseus." It's obvious that Justin and other early Christians knew how similar Christianity was to the Pagan religions. However, Justin had a solution. As far as he was concerned, the Devil did it. The Devil had the foresight to come before Christ, and create these characteristics in the Pagan world. Fundamentalist Christianity, fascinating. These people actually believe the World is 12,000 years old. I actually asked one of these guys: "OK, dinosaur fossils?" He says: "Dinosaur fossils? God put those here to test our faith!" "I think God put you here to test my faith, dude!" The Bible is nothing more than an astro-theological literary hybrid, just like nearly all religious myths before it. In fact, the aspect of transference, of one character's attributes to a new character, can be found within the book itself. In the Old Testament, there's the story of Joseph. Joseph was a prototype for Jesus. Joseph was born of a miracle birth, Jesus was born of a miracle birth. Joseph was of 12 brothers, Jesus had 12 disciples. Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver, Jesus was sold for 30 pieces of silver. Brother "Judah" suggests the sale of Joseph, disciple "Judas" suggests the sale of Jesus. Joseph began his work at the age of 30, Jesus began his work at the age of 30. The parallels go on and on. Furthermore, is there any non-Biblical historical evidence of any person, living with the name Jesus, the Son of Mary, who traveled about with 12 followers, healing people and the like? There are numerous historians who lived in and around the Mediterranean either during or soon after the assumed life of Jesus. How many of these historians document this figure? Not one. However, to be fair, that doesn't mean defenders of the Historical Jesus haven't claimed the contrary. Four historians are typically referenced to justify Jesus's existence. Pliny the younger, Suetonius, Tacitus are the first three. Each one of their entries consists of only a few sentences at best and only refer to the Christus or the Christ, which in fact is not name but a title. It means the Anointed One. The fourth source is Josephus and this source has been proven to be a forgery for hundreds of years. Sadly, it is still cited as truth. You would think that a guy who rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven for all eyes to see and performed the wealth of miracles acclaimed to him would have made it into the historical record. It didn't because once the evidence is weighed, there are very high odds that the figure known as Jesus, did not even exist. We don't want to be unkind, but we want to be factual. We don't want to cause hurt feelings, but we want to be academically correct, in what we understand and know to be true. Christianity just is not based on truth. We find that Christianity was in fact nothing more than a Roman story, developed politically. The reality is, Jesus was the Solar Deity of the Gnostic Christian sect, and like all other Pagan Gods, he was a mythical figure. It was the political establishment that sought to historize the Jesus figure for social control. By 325 AD. in Rome, Emperor Constantine conviened the Council of Nicea, It was during this meeting that the politically motivated Christian Doctrines were established and thus began a long history of Christian bloodshed and spiritual fraud. And for the next 1600 years, the Vatican maintained a political stranglehold on all of Europe, leading to such joyous periods as the Dark Ages, along with enlightening events such as the Crusades, and the Inquisition. Christianity, along with all other related theologies is a hystorical fraud. These religions now serves to detach the species from the natural world, and likewise, each other. They support blind submission to authority. They reduce human responsibility to the effect that "God" controls everything, and in turn awful crimes can be justified in the name of Divine Pursuit. And most criticlly, it empowers the political estamblishment who has been using the mith to manipulate and control societies. The religious myth is the most powerful device ever created, and serves as the psychological soil upon which other myths can flourish. A myth is an idea that, while widely believed, is false. In a deeper sense, in the religious sense, a myth serves as an orienting and mobilizing story for people. The focus is not on the story's relation to reality but on its function. A story cannot function, unless it is believed to be true in the community or the nation. It is not a matter of debate if some people have the bad taste to raise the question of the truth of the sacred story. The keepers of the faith do not enter into the debate with them. They ignore them, or denounce them as blasphemers. It is wrong, blasphemous and sinful for you to suggest, imply or help other people to come to conclusion that the U.S. Government killed 3,000 of its own citizens. As if a demolition team set off, when you do the demolition of an old building. It looks like one of those scenes of an old building being purposely dynamited and blown up. Anybody who ever watched a building being demolished, on purpose, knows that if you're going to do this you have to get the under-infrastructure of the building and bring it down. The way the structure is collapsing... This was the result of something that was planned. It's not accidental that the first tower just happened to collapse and then the second tower just happened to collapse in exactly the same way. How they accomplished this, we don't know. The building collapsed to dust. You don't find a desk, you don't find a chair, you don't find a telephone or computer. The biggest piece of a telephone I found was half of the keypad, and it was about this big. What happened to the concrete? The concrete was pulverized. From river to river, this dust powder, two or three inches thick, The concrete was just uh... pulverized! Reminiscence of pictures we've all seen too much in TV before, a building is deliberately destroyed by well placed dynamite to knock it down. It's as if they had detonators, yes, detonators, planted to take down the building, boom, boom, boom! I heard a second explosion. There was a heavy-duty explosion. There was a secondary explosion and then a subsequent collapse. ...explosion blow and then it knocked everybody over. To me it sounded like an explosion. It sounded like gun-fire, bang-bang-bang. And then all of a sudden, three big explosions. ...and we heard big explosion coming down. ...and then the entire top of the building just blew up. We saw some kind of explosion. ...by the force of the explosions... - ...big explosion... - It blew us back into the 8th floor... ...then we got to lobby, there was a big explosion. The lobby looked as though, a bomb had exploded there. ...huge explosion, now raining debris... ...there's been a huge explosion... ...huge explosion that we all heard and felt. We just witnessed some kind of explosion... ...it was very loud... it blasted... explosion... ...smoke and secondary explosion in Tower 1... ...that is another bomb going off... He thinks that there were actually devices that were planted in the building... ...planted in the building... I don't think anybody could have predicted that they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile. ...nobody in our government at least, and I don't think the prior government could have envisioned flying airplanes into the buildings. No specific threats involving, really domestic operations involving what happened obviously, the cities, airlines and so on. There were no warning signs that I am aware of. USAToday reports that in the two years before the attacks on September 11th NORAD conducted exercises using hijacked airliners as weapons. And one target was the World Trade Center. In confidential documents from the Philippines obtained by CNN, the plan was clear: He would board any American commercial aircraft, control its cockpit, and dive it at the CIA headquarters. Other buildings targeted the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. The FAA, received 52 warnings about Al'Queida in 6 months before 9/11 and did not apparentlly heave them ... Pentagon reportedlly, does not want to public to hear the next week Senat's testimony about former, secret inteligence unit, known as Able Danger. And indentified Mohammed Atta and three other 9/11 terorists members of Al'queida cell in Brooklyn NY, more than a year before the attacks. We found two of three cells which conducted 9/11 attacks. Lt. Col. Anthony Sharffer who is the first member of Able Danger to go public, has now been told, in writting by Defence and Inteligence Agency that he can't speek to members of Congres or their staff without their prior approval. This is an attempt to prevent the American people from knowing the facts of how we could prevented 9/11, and people are covering it today. Security and counter-terrorism was blinking red, in the words of George Tenet, that the warnings of an imminent attack were so severe, that something dramatic should have been done. It was unparalleled. Instead, our president went on a month long vacation? The head of Pakistani Intelligence of the ISI, Mahmood Ahmed requested Omar Sheikh to wire $100,000 to Mohammed Atta, who was the lead hijacker. ...hijacker Mohammed Atta received wire transfers via Pakistan. The man sending the money to Atta is believed to be Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh. Omar Sheikh admitted he was supported by the Pakistani Government's Intelligence service; the ISI. As hard as this is to believe 2 of the elleged terorists involved in what happend on Tuesday may attendet schools run by U.S. military Evidence was also apparently planted. The passport of one of the hijackers on Flight 11 was allegedly found in the rubble. The hijackers passport was found blocks from WTC crash site can you believe that. The 9/11 hijackers are alive and well that is according to Chief of Japan Democratic Party who says: 'The 9/11 is a hoax'. Several of these 19 men are still alive. Of course we're after Saddam Hussein, I mean bin Laden, he's, he's, he's... In the early 1980s, Bin Laden worked with operatives from U.S. inteligence, the Pakistani military and Arab states. January 2001. The Bush Administration orders the FBI and intelligence agencies to back off investigations involving the bin Laden family, including two of Osama bin Laden's relatives who were living, guess where? In Falls Church, Virginia, right next to CIA headquarters. When he was already America's "most wanted criminal" he reportedly spent two weeks in the American hospital in Dubai, was treated by an American doctor and visited by the local CIA agent, We have not seen one piece of evidence that links Osama bin Laden directly to the planning stages of September 11th. This failure to provide proof was later said to be unnecessary because bin Laden in the video allegedly found in Afghanistan, admitted responsibility for the attacks. In 1976, Osama's older brother, Saleem bin Laden, hired a man in Texas by the name of Jim Bath to handle all the investments in the United States for the bin Laden family. Jim Bath also happens to be a personal, almost life-long friend and former international guard pilot, with George W. Bush. The connections between the Bushes and the bin Ladens become much more clearer when George Herbert Walker Bush made trips to Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 2000 to meet with the bin Laden family on behalf of the company called the Carlyle Group. How could anyone fly a 60 ton, 125 ft wide, 44 ft tall plane through this obstacle course. The aircraft, before striking the Pentagon, reportedly executed a 270 degree downward spiral and yet Hani Hanjour was known as a terrible pilot who could not safely fly, even a small plane. No seats, no luggage, no bodies. Nothing but bricks and limestone. The official explanation is that the intense heat from the jet fuel vaporized the entire plane. Flight 77 had two Rolls Royce engines made of steel and titanium alloy and weighed 6 tons each. It is scientifically impossible that 12 tons of steel and titanium was vaporized by jet fuel. We're also told that the bodies were able to be identified either by the fingerprints or by the DNA. So what kind of fire can vaporize aluminum and tempered steel and yet leave human bodies intact? From my close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon and as I say the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you can pick up in your hand. Shortly after the strike, government agents picked up debris and carried it off. The entire lawn was covered with dirt and gravel so that any remaining forensic evidence was literally covered up. The videos from security cameras which would show what really hit the Pentagon were immediately confiscated by agents of the FBI. And the Department of Justice has to this day, refused to release them. If these videos would prove that the Pentagon was really hit by a 757, most of us would assume the Government would release them. It looks like there's nothing there except for a hole in the ground. Basically, that's right. The only thing you could see from where we were, uh, was a big gouge in the earth and some broken trees. You could see some people working, walking around in the area, but from where we can see there wasn't much left. Any large pieces of debris at all? No, there was nothing. Nothing, that you can distinguish that a plane had crashed there. The FBI and State police confirm that thaey have cornered off a second area, about 6-8 miles away from the creater here This is apparently another debris site. Why would a debris be located 6 miles away? Could it be blown that far away? Seams highly unlikely. Pancake theory, according to which the fires, although not melting the steel, heated up sufficiently to cause the floors weakened by the airplane strikes to break loose from the steel columns, and this started a chain reaction. So, you would expect then from that theory, which is the official theory, to see a whole stack of floors piled up on top of each other and then a spindle of core columns standing too. The core of each of the Twin Towers consisted of 47 massive steel columns. If the floors had broken loose from them, these columns would have still been sticking up in the air a thousand feet. The plane did not cut all those core columns. We designed the buildings to take the impact of the Boeing 707, hitting the building at any location. The building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners. ...that the plane flew straight into the building. Straight through, right. So you're saying that the building was actually designed to cope with a hole like that - and would still survive? - Yes, it was. If you would drop, say a billiard ball from the top of the World Trade Center, 110 floors up there it would have taken 8 to 10 seconds to hit the ground, encountering no resistance whatsoever. The Twin Towers came down in nearly free fall speed. 200,000 tons of steel shatters and explodes outwards over 500 ft. This means that floors shattered at an average rate of about ten floors per second. There is no scenario for a pancake effect of buildings falling that allows them to fall at a rate of free fall. And what can do that? What can move mass out of the way? Explosives. 47 huge steel columns going up the core that are interconnected, how do you get them to fail simultaneously so the core disappeared. It looks like those core columns were cut. The way we do this is by cutting the beam at an angle. I started looking at the molten metal. All three buildings, both towers in the rubble, in the basement areas, and Building 7 there were these pools of molten metal. You get down below and you see molten steel. Molten steel running down the channel rails. Like you were in a foundry. Like lava of a volcano. The molten steel was found 'three, four and five weeks later when the rubble was being removed.' He said that molten steel was also found underneath World Trade Center 7. So I'm looking through the official reports, what do they say about the molten metal? They say nothing. Wait a minute. This is important evidence. Where did that come from? Thermite is so hot that it'll just cut through steel, through the structural steel, for example, like a knife through butter. The products are molten iron and aluminum oxide which goes off primarily as a dust. You know, those enormous dust clouds you can imagine, when you assemble these chemicals on a large scale. Molten metal pools under both towers after they collapsed, and Building 7. Now, Building 7 wasn't even hit by a jet. Part of the problem is that most people simply don't know much about Building 7. due to the extraordinary secrecy surrounding its collapse. This was a 47 story skyscraper. This building fell at 17:25. It was not hit by a plane. This building had fires on only 2 or 3 floors. ...and it was brought down by what we know was a controlled demolition. Demolitions look just like that, kink in the middle, and then that building just comes straight down almost at free fall speed. Our office was on the B-1 level. As I was talking to a supervisor at 8.46 and all of a sudden, we hear, boom! An explosion so hard that pushed us upwards. And it came from the basement, between the B-2 level and the B-3 level. And when I went to verbalize, we heard boom! That impact of the plane on the top. As it apear to be more smoke comming from the ground. I was down at the basement. I came down ... and all the sudden the elevator blew up. As we were comming out, we pass the lobby, there was no lobby. So, I believe that the bomb hit the lobby first. And couple seconds ? when the first plane hits. As I'm walking by the main freight car of the building in the corridor, that's when I got blown. I mean, the impact of the explosion threw me to the floor and that's when everything started happening. All of a sudden, a big impact happened again and all the ceiling tiles were falling down, the light fixtures were falling... You know, you gotta go clear across the whole from 1 to 2 World Trade Center and then all of a sudden, it happened all over again. Something else hit us to the floor... right in the basement you felt it, the walls were caving in on, everything that was going on. I mean, I know people that got killed in the basement, I know people that got broken legs in the basement, people got reconstructive surgery because the walls hit them in the face. According to standard operating procedure, if an FAA flight control notices anything that suggests a possible hijacking, controllers are to contact the superior. If the problem cannot be fixed within about a minute the superior should ask NORAD (North American Aerospace Command) to send up or scramble jet fighters to find out what is going on. NORAD then issues a scramble order to the nearest air force base, with fighters on alert. And although interceptions usually occur within 10 or so minutes, in this case, 80 or so minutes had elapsed before the fighters were even airborne. It's a mind-bending anomaly. Not a single US Air Force interceptor turns a wheel until it's too late. There are no jets at all. What if they were so confused, and had been so deliberately confused that they couldn't respond? The reason that they didn't know where to go was because a number of conflicting and overlapping war game exercises were taking place that involved the insertion of false radar blips on the radar screens in the north-east air defense sector. There was another exercise; "Vigilant Warrior", which was in fact, according to a NORAD source, a live-fly hijack drill being conducted at the same time. With only 8 available fighter aircrafts, and that have to be dispatched in pairs, they were dealing with as many as 22 possible hijacks on the day of 9/11 and they couldn't separate the war game exercises from the actual hijacks. Page 172: "The US Government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9/11 attacks. Ultimately, the question is of little practical significance." The American authorities have not managed to trace the source of the funding. And then the most amazingly disingenuous statement, "Ultimately is it of little consequence". It is of massive consequence! Doesn't it matter who paid for 9/11? The collapse of Building 7 has been recognized as especially difficult to explain. The 9/11 Commission Report implicitly admitted that it could not explain the collapse of this building by not even mentioning it. Mr. President, why are you and the Vice President insisting on appearing together before the 9/11 Commission? Because the 9/11 Commission wants to ask us questions, that's why we are meeting, and I look forward to meeting with them and answering their questions. The question was: Why are you appearing together, rather than separately, which was their request? Because it's a good chance for both of us to answer questions that the 9/11 Commission is looking forward to asking us, and I am looking forward to answering them. Do you think they should be able to stand up and speak their own words? They should go under oath. - They should be-- - Yeah. In public. Don't you think that the families deserve to have a transcript or to be able to see-- Adam, you asked me this question yesterday, I got the same answer. Yeah. The final report was a unanimous report. That means that if there was a single commissioner who had any objection about anything, that fact would be dropped from the report. We have found out that he not only served on the transition team of the Bush Administration, that he was a person who wrote a draft memo for the setup of the Bush Administration's National Security Council, that he was an individual who wrote the preemptive war strategy that was eventually used for the war on Iraq, that he's a close friend of Condoleezza Rice's... We want him to resign. There is literally nothing in the 9/11 report that the Bush Administration did not approve of. We can understand therefore why that commission under Zelikow leadership would have ignored all the evidence that would point to the truth that 9/11 was a false flag operation intended to authorize the doctrines and funds needed for a new level of imperial mobilization.

And of course, believe-to-be-linked-to-al-Qaeda. But, it's the so-called "War on Terrorism" that's in our faces, practically 24/7 as the inescapable focus of our existence. One day, our grandchildren will look back on this time and ask: "How was the war on terror won?" The entire US ruling class, ruling elite comes to see terrorism as the preferred means, indeed the only means, to provide social cohesion, to provide an enemy image for the society, to keep it together. According to NeoCon Theory from Carl Schmitt, you have to have an enemy image, in order to have a society. A very dangerous thing because now it means that the entire social order, the political parties, intellectual life, politics in general, are all based on a monstrous myth. Look, what the CIA has done in this country. What they have done to us is unbelievable. Look at the terrorist acts that have occurred. The CIA behind most, if not, all of them. We had the Marine Barracks, then embassy in Kenya, We had Pan Am 103, we had the USS Cole, we had Oklahoma City, we had the World Trade Center in 1993. ...that helped the terrorists to blow up the WTC the first time. They built the bomb, they got the driver's license. The informer Emad A. Salem, a 43-year-old former Egyptian Army officer, he was given the assignment to put the bomb together and he went to the supervisor, that's the FBI supervisor, and he said, "We're gonna put a dummy bomb" right? and the FBI supervisor says "No, we're gonna put a real bomb." The FBI actually carried out the attack on the World Trade Center in 1993. They actually hired Emad Salem and paid him 1 million dollars and gave him real explosives, a detonator and told him to build a bomb and to give it to the foolish people that he was controlling to allow them to attack the World Trade Center complex. Unfortunately for them, there were only six people killed, not enough to pass the legislation. So, what happened is two years later, April 19, 1995 down comes Oklahoma City, the Murrah Building, 168 people killed... one year later, the anti-terror legislation, which takes away many of our constitutional rights and civil liberties, is passed. It was at half past 9 this morning. We were actually running an exercise for a company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning, so I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing up right! To get this quite straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope with this and it happened while you were running the exercise? Precisely. We're supposed to believe it was some kind of coincidence. There was also an anti-terrorist drill going on on 7/7. And again, just like on 9/11, they were talking about attacks on the same targets, the same tube stations at the exactly the same time as the actual attack happened providing some kind of cover for what must be operations orchestrated in some way by the State. I am absolutely appalled at how much people in this country do not think. We are given to understand that an Arabic guy out there up in the mountains financed the most elaborate attack on this country. Do you think some people in a cave were able to have NORAD stand down? Do you think that people in the cave were able to have all of this happen? And when I think about how many Americans were killed in New York City and believing as I do that this thing was a set up job, this is a textbook operation that Nazis used and they've used it over and over again. America has been suckered in one more time. I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the streets. There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be! We know things are bad. Worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller. And all we say is, "Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV, my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone." Well I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street, All I know is that first you've got to get mad! You've got to say, "I'm a human being, goddamn it! My life has value! Oh God! "When hostilities commenced in Europe in 1939 it was realized that the American people had no intention of entering the war but they believed that this country could be enticed into the war, in very much the same way, that it was enticed into the last one They planned, first, to prepare the United States for foreign war, under the guise of American defense Second, to involve us in the war, step by step without our realization. Third, to create a series of incidences, which would force us into the actual conflict. These plans were, of course, to be covered and assisted by the full power of their propaganda, Our theaters soon became filled with plays, portraying the glory of war. News reels lost all semblance of objectivity. and they have used the war to justify the restriction of congressional power and the assumption of dictatorial procedures, on the part of the President and his appointees. A fear campaign was inaugurated. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices, of other peoples, to lead our country to destruction" 1775, the American Revolutionary War began, as the American colonies sought to detach from England, and it's oppressive monarchy. Although many reasons are cited for the revolution, one in particular sticks out as the prime cause: that King George III of England outlawed the interest free independent currency the colonies were producing and using for themselves, in turn forcing them to borrow money from the Central Bank of England, at interest, immediately putting the colonies into debt. In words of Peter Cooper Former Vice president of New York Board of Currency "After Franklin had explained ... to the British Goverment as the real cause of prosperity, they immediately passed laws, forbidding the payment of taxes in that money. This produced such great incovenience and misery to the people, that it was the principalcause of revolution." In 1783, America won its independence from England. However, its battle against the central bank concept and the corrupt, power hungry mentality associated with had just begun. So what is a Central Bank? A Central Bank is an institution that issues and regulates the currency of an entire nation. Based on historical precedent, the typical powers are inherent in central banking practice. Includes the control of interest rates, and the expansion and contraction of the money supply itself. Now, the central bank does not simply issue money to the government, it loans it to them with interest. Then, through the mechanizms of increasing and decreasing the supply of money, the central bank esentially regulates the value of the currency issued. It is critical to understand that the entire structure of this system can only produce one thing in the long run: Debt. It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity to figure this scam out. For nearlly every single dollar produced by both the central bank and it regulated commercial banks. Is loan at interest. That means every single dollar produced is actually the dollar, plus a certain percent of debt based on that dollar. And since abanking system has a monopoly over the production of the currency and they loan each dollar out with immediate debt attached to it, where does the money to pay for the debt come from? It can only come from the central bank again. Which means the central bank has to perpetually increase its money supply to temporarily cover the outstanding debt created, which in turn, since that new money is loaned out at interest as well, creates even more debt! The end result of this system is esentually slavery. For it is techniclly impossible for the government and thus the public, to ever come out of the self-generating debt. By the early 20th century, the US had already implemented, and removed a few central banking systems, which were swindled into place by ruthless banking interests. At this time, the dominant families in the banking and business world were: the Rockefellers, the Morgans, the Warburgs, the Rothschilds. And in the early 1900's, they sought to push once again, legislation to create another central bank, However, they knew the government and public were weary of such an institution. So they needed to create an incident to affect public opinion. So, J.P. Morgan, publicly considered a financial luminary at the time, exploited his mass influence by repeatly creating rumors that a prominent bank in New York was insolvent, or bankrupt. Morgan knew this would trigger mass hysteria and systemic crisis. And it did. The public, in fear of losing their deposits, immediately began mass withdrawals. Consequently, the banks were forced to call in their loans, causing the recipients to sell their property, and thus a spiral of bankruptcies, repossessions, and turmoil emerged. Putting the pieces together years later, Congresman Charles Lindbergh wrote: "The King bankers put in motion. In 1907, a great scheme. Thay had gamled and speculated on Wall Street until so many watered stocks and bonds had been manufactuated. The King bankers knew the condition and informed the favored of their friends what was to come. There was to be a panic in the fall of 1907 that would be advertised as the result of our bad banking and currency laws" The Panic of 1907 led to a Congressional investigation, headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich, who had intimate ties to the financial powers, and later became part of the Rockefeller family through marriage. The Commission led by Aldrich recommended a Central Bank should be implemented, so a panic like 1907 "could never happen again". This was the spark the international bankers needed to initiate their plan. In 1910, a secret meeting was held at a J.P. Morgan estate on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia. It was there that the central banking bill called the Federal Reserve Act was written. This legislation was written by bankers, not law-makers. This meeting was so secretive, so concealed from government and public knowledge, that the most of so figures who attended, disguised their names when in route to the island. After this bill was constructed, it was then handed over to their political front-man, Senator Nelson Aldrich, to push through Congress. And in 1913, with heavy political sponsorship by the bankers, Woodrow Wilson became President, having already agreed to sign the Federal Reserve Act in exchange for campaign support. And a few days before Christmas, when much of Congress was at home with their families, the Federal Reserve Act was voted in, and Wilson in turn made it law. The night before it passage Congressman Charles Lindbergh, ?? This act establishes the most gigantic trust on Earth ... "When the President signs this act, the invisible goverment by the money power ... will be legalized." Now, the public was told that the Federal Reserve System was an economic stabilizer. And inflation and economic crisis were a thing of the past. Well, as history has shown, nothing is further from the truth. The fact is the bankers now had a streamlined machine to economical manipulation. For example, from 1914 to 1919, the Fed ?? increased the money supply. Resulting in extensive loans to small banks and the public. Then in 1920, the Fed deliberatly contracted credit in extreme way. thus resulting in the supporting banks having to call in huge numbers of loans, and just like in 1907: bank runs, bankruptcy, and systamic colapse ocured. Numorous competitive banks outside of the Federal Reserve System collapsed. Further consolidating the monopoly to amoney trust cartel. Privy to this scheme, Congressman Lindberg pronaunced: "Under the Federal Reserve Act, panics are scientifically created. The present panic is the first scientifically created one, worked out as we figure a mathematical equation." However, the panic of 1920 was just a warm-up. From 1921 to 1929, the Fed again increased the money supply, resulting once again in extensive loans to the public and banks. There was also a fairly new type of loan in the stock market. The broker call loan. Very simply, a loan allowed an investor to put down only a fraction of a stocks value, with the rest being loaned from the broker. This method was very popular in the roaring 1920's, as everyone seemed to be making money in the market. However, there was a catch to this loan. It could be called in at any time, and had to be paid within 24 hours. And the typical result was the selling of the stock purchased with that loan. So, a few months before October of 1929, J.D. Rockefeller, Bernard Baruck, and other insiders quietly exited the market, knowing that bubble created was about to burst. And on October 24.-th 1929 The financiers who furnished the call loans started to calling them in. In mass. This sparked an instantaneous massive sell-off in the already inflated market, as sell orders and margin calls were systemaclly trigerred. Than that lead to mass bankrupcy, eventually collapsing thousands of banks. Enabeling the large banks to buy out now the failed ones. At the discount. But that didn't stop there. Rather than expand the money supply to recover from this economic collapse, the Fed actually contracted it, fueling one of the largest depressions in history. Outraged, Congressman Louis McFadden, ? Chairman of House of Banking Comitte Filed a petition for ? against the Federal Reserve Board, Stating: "Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the World has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks. This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of United States ... And has practiclly bankrupted our Goverment. It has done this trough the defects of the law under which it operates. Trough the maladministration of that law by the Federal Reserve Board and trough the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it." Now, having reduced the society to squalor, it is than decided that the Gold Standard should be removed. In order to do this, they needed to acquire the remaining gold in the system. So, under the pretense of helping to end the Depression came the 1933 Gold Seizure. Under threat of imprisonment for 10 years, everyone in America was required to turn in all gold bullion to the Treasury, essentially robbing the public of what little wealth they had left. At the end of 1933, the gold standard was abolished. If you look at a dollar bill from before 1933, it says it is redeemable in gold. If you look at a dollar bill today, it says it is legal tender, which means it is backed by absolutely nothing. The only thing that gives our money value is the public fate and how much of it is in the circulation. Therefore the power to regulate the money supply is also the power to regulate its value, which is also the power to manipulate and control entire economies. It's important to clearly understand: The Federal Reserve is a private corporation. It is about as "Federal" as "Federal Express." It makes its own policies, and is under little regulation by the US government. It is a private bank that loans all the currency at interest to the government, completely consistent with central banking model that the country sought to escape from when it declared independence in the American Revolutionary War. Now, going back to 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was not the only bill pushed through Congress that vast the financial intrests. They also pushed it's partner the federal income tax. First of all, the federal income tax is completely unconstitutional, as it is a direct, unapportioned tax. And the required number of states nedded in order to ratify the amendment to allow the income tax was never legally met, and this has even been cited in modern court cases. Second, at the present day, roughly 25% of the average worker's income is taken via this tax. That means you work tree months out of the year to fullfill this tax obligation. And where does this money go?? Well, according to Grace Commission from the 1980-ties "... 100% what is collencted is apsorbed solely by interest on the Federal debt and by the Federal goverment contributions to transfer payments. In other words, all individual income tax revenue are already gone before one nickle is spent on the services which taxpayers expect from their Goverment." Today, the money Americans make 3 months out of the year Goes almost entirelly to the interest fees charged by the debth based fee out of currency The fact is The Federal income Tax exists to feed Federal Reserve Federal Goverment money macshine. Making sure that the intrest payments are always there. And third, even with the government claim as to the legality of the income tax, there is evidentlly no statute, no law in existence, that requires you to pay this tax. I really expected that of course there's a law, that you can point to in the law book that requires you to file a tax return. Of course there is. I was at that point where I couldn't find the statute that clearly made a person liable, at least not me, and most people I know, and I had no choice in my mind except to resign. Based on the research that I did throughout the year 2000 and that I'm still doing, I have not found that law. I've asked Congress, a lot of people, in the IRS, Commissioner's helpers, they can't answer, because if they answer, the American people are gonna know that this whole thing is a fraud. I haven't filed a federal income tax return since I left. I have not filed a tax return since 1999. Now, the control of the economy and the manipulation of society for the vast financial powers is only a part of the game being played. Another level is bussines of War. Since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a number of large and small wars have commenced. The 3 most pronounced were World War I, World War II, and Vietnam. World War I. In 1914, European wars broke out centered around England and Germany. The American public wanted nothing to do with the war, in turn President Wilson publicly declared neutrality. However, under the surface, evidence now shows that the financial powers behind the administration ware looking for any excuse they could find to enter it. It's important to understand that the most lucrative thing that can happen for international bankers, is war. For it forces the county to borrow even more money at interest. Not to mention the profit generated thru financing of the military productions. In the words of the 2 times Congresial Medal of Honour winner Smedley D. Butler "War is a racket. It is always has been. It is possibly the oldest, esily the most profitable, surlely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profit are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives." Woodrow Wilson's top adviser and mentor was Colonel Edward House, a man with intimate connections with the financial intrests at the time. In a conversation between Colonel House, Wilson's Advisor, and Sir Edward Grey, The Foreign Secretary of England, regarding how to get America into the war. Grey inquired: "What will Americans do if Germans sink an Ocean Liner with American passengers on board?" House responded: "I believe that a flame of indignation would sweep the United States and that by itself would be sufficient to carry us into war." So, on May 7th 1915 a ship called the Lusitania was deliberately sent where German military vessels were know to be. And, as expected, German U-boats torpedoed the ship, exploding stored ammunition, killing 1200 people. To further understand the obvious anticipation of this setup, the German Embassy actually put advertisements in the New York Times, telling people that if they boarded the Lusitania, they did so at their own risk, as such a ship sailing from America to England through the war zone, would be liable to destruction. In turn and as anticipated, the sinking of the Lusitania created a wave of anger among the American population and America entered the war a short time after. World War 2. On December 7th 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor, triggering US into that war. President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that the attack was a "day that will live in infamy". A day of infamy indeed, but not because of the alleged surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. After 60 years of surfacing information, it is clear that not only was the attack on Pearl Harbor known weeks in advance, it was outright wanted and provoked. In a journal entry, by Roosevelt's Secretary of War Henry Stimson, dated November 25th, 1941, he documented a conversation he had with Roosevelt: "The question was how should we maneuver them into firing the first shot. And in a Congresial testimony later he added It was desirable to make sure the Japanese be the ones to do this so that there should remain no doubt as to who were the aggressors." In the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt did everything in his power to anger the Japanese, showing a posture of aggression. He halted all of Japans' imports of American Petroleum. He froze all the Japanese assets in the United States. He made public loans to Nationalist China and supplied military aid to the British, both enemies to Japan in the war... Which, by the way, was completely in violation of international war rules. And with numorous Japanese codes broken in advance revealing the plan to attack. On December 7th 1941, Japan was allowed to attacked Pearl Harbor, killing 2400 soldiers. Before Pearl Harbor, 83% of the American public wanted nothing to do with the war. After Pearl Harbor, 1 million men volunteered for that war. It is important to note, Nazi Germany's war effort was largely supported by two organizations, one of which was called I.G. Farben. I.G. Farben produced 84% of Germany's explosives One of the unspoken partners of I.G. Farben was J.D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company in America, In fact, the German Air Force could not operate without a special additive patterned by Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The drastic bombing of London by Nazi Germany, for example, was made possible by a 20 million dollar sale of fuel to I.G. Farben by the Rockefeller Standard Oil Company. This is just one small point on topic how American business funded both sides of World War 2. One other treasonous organization worth mentioning is the Union Banking Corporation of New York City. Not only did it finance numerous aspects of Hitler's rise to power, along with actual materials during the war, it was also a Nazi money laundering bank, which was eventually exposed for having millions of dollars of Nazi Money in its vaults. The Union Banking Corporation of New York was eventually seized for violation of the Trading with the Enemy Act. Guess who the director and vice-president of the Union Bank was? Prescott Bush, the father and grandfather, of former US presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush Vietnam. The United States official escalation and entry to the Vietnam war, came after an alleged incident involving two US destroyers being attacked by North Vietnamese PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin. This was known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. This situation was the catalystic pretext for massive troop deployment and full fledged warfare. One problem however. The attack on the US destroyers by Vietnamese PT boats... never happened. Former Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, stated years later that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a "mistake", while declasified documents released years later show that it was a farse. Manipulated for purposes of war. Once in the war, it was business as usual. In October 1966, President Lyndon Johnson lifted trading restrictions on the Soviet Block, knowing full well that the Soviets were providing upwards of 80% of North Vietnam's war supplies. Consequently, Rockefeller interests financed factories in the Soviet Union, which the Soviets used to manufacture military equipment and send to North Vietnam. However, the funding of both sides of this conflict was only one side of the coin. In 1985, Vietnam's Rules of Engagement were declassified. This detailed what American troops were and were not allow to do in the war. It included absurdities like: North Vietnamese anti-aircraft missile systems could not be bombed until they were known to be fully operational. No enemy could be pursued once they crossed the border of Laos or Cambodia. And most revealing of all, the most critical, strategic targets were not allowed to be attacked, unless initiated by high military officials. Apart from these ilogical limitations, North Vietnam was informed of these restrictions and therefore could base entire strategies around the limitations of the American Forces. This is why the war went on so long and the bottom line is this: The Vietnam War was never meant to be won... Just sustained. This war for profit and resources resulted in 58,000 American deaths and 3 million dead Vietnamese. So, where are we now. September 11th was the jumpstart for a hergemonic agenda enabelin possibility of constant global warfare. It was a staged war pretext, no different than the sinking of the Lusitania, the provoking of Pearl Harbor and the Gulf of Tonkin lie. In fact if 9/11 wasn't a planned war pretext, it would be an exception to the rule. It has been used to launch two unprovoked illegal wars. One against Iraq and one against Afghanistan. However, 9/11 was the pretext for another war as well. The war against you. The Patriot Act, Homeland Security, the Military Tribunals Act and other legislations, are all completely designed to destroy your civil liberties and protect those in power. Currently in the United States, unannounced to most Americans, your home can be searched without a warrant, without you being home, you can, in turn, be detained indefinetly with no charges revealed to you, no access to a lawyer and legally tortured. All under the suspicion that you might be a "terrorist". If you need a painted picture of what is happening, let's recognize how history repeats itself. In February 1933, Hitler staged a false flag attack, burning down his own German parliament building, the Reichstag, and blamed it on communist terrorists. Within the next few weeks, he passed the Enabling Act, which completely eradicated the German Constitution destroying people's liberties. He then let a series of preemptive wars all justified as necessary to maintaining "homeland security". Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them. It's time to wake up. The people in power go out of their way to make sure you are perpetually mislead and manipulated. The majorities perception of reality, especially in the political arena is not their own. It is shrewdly imposed upon them, without them even knowing it. For example, the public at large now believes the invasion of Iraq and the Middle East along with the resolting instability are consequences of the political and military mistakes. What the public fails to se, ofcourse, is that these destabilizizations of the Middle East are exactly what Western interest wants. This war is to be sustained, so the region can be divided up, domination of the oil maintained, continual profits reaped for the defense contractors and most obviously, permanent military bases established to be used as a launching pad against other oil bearing, non-conforming countries, such as Iran, For further implication, that the Middle East destabilization is purely intentional In 2005, 2 elite British SAS officers were arrested by Iraq police after being caught driving around in their car shooting at civilians, while dressed up as Arabs. After being arrested and taken to a jail in Basra, the British army immediately requested the release of these men. When the Basra government refused, British tanks came in and physically broke out the men from the Basra prison. If you wish to destroy an area, how do you do it? Well there are two ways: You can go in there and bomb it, and so forth, but that is not very efficient. What you do is try to get the people in that area to kill each other and to destroy there own territory, their own farms. And that's what has been done in that area. The way in which you destroy an opponent is get him to destroy himself, by dividing his ranks against one another. Then you feed both sides, you have agents feeding both sides, inflaming both sides. And they kill each other off. And it's time that some of us woke up to this reality. To understand that people who try to maintain empires and create empires, do it by manipulating the people they are trying to conquer. You might to ask yourself why the entire culture is utterly saturated with mass media entertainment from all sides, while the educational system in America continues it stupefying downward slide since the US government decided to take over and subsidize the public school system. What your government pays for, it gets. When we understand that, then we look at government financed institutions of education and see the kind of students and the kind of education that is being turned out by these government financed schools, logic will tell you that if what is being turned out in those schools was not in accord with what the state and the federal government wanted, then it would change it. The bottom line is that the government is getting what they have ordered. They do not want your children to be educated. They do not want you to think too much. That is why our country and our world has become so proliferated with entertainments, mass media, television shows, amusement parks, drugs, alcohol and every kind of entertainment, to keep the human mind entertained. So that you don't get in the way of important people by doing too much thinking. You had better wake up and understand that there are people who are guiding your life and you don't even know it." We are in a lot of trouble! Because you people and 62 million other Americans are listening to me right now. Because less than 3 percent of you people read books. Because less 15 percent of you read newspapers. Because the only truth you know is what you get over this tube. Right now there is a whole, an entire generation that never knew anything that didn't come out of this tube. This tube is the gospel, the ultimate revelation. This tube can make or break presidents, popes, prime ministers... This tube is the most awesome goddamn force in the whole godless world and woe is us, if it ever falls in the hands of the wrong people. And when the largest company in the world controls the most awesome goddamn propaganda force in the whole godless world, who knows what shit will be peddled for truth on this network! So you listen to me... Listen to me: Television is not the truth. Television is a goddamned amusement park, television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troop of acrobats, story tellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, sideshow freaks, lion tamers and football players. We are in the boredom killing business! But you people sit there, day after day, night after night, all ages, colors, creeds... We are all you know. You're beginning to believe the illusions we are spinning here, you are beginning to think the tube is reality and that your own lives are unreal. You do whatever the tube tells you. You dress like the tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube, you even think like the tube... This is mass madness, you maniacs. In God's name, you people are the real thing. We are the illusion! The last thing the power establishment wants is a conscious informed public, capable of critical thinking. This is why a continually fraudulent zeitgeist is output via religion, the mass media, and the educational system. It is in their interest to keep you in a distracted, naive bubble. And they are doing a damn good job of it. This is Aaron Russo, a filmmaker and former politician. To his left is Nicholas Rockefeller of the Council of the foregein relations. After maintaining a close friendship with Nicholas Rockefeller, Aaron eventually ended the relationship, appalled by what he had learn I got a call one day from an attorney I knew and she said: "Would you like to meet one of the Rockefellers?" And I said: "Sure I would love to." And we became friends and he began to divulge a lot of things to me, so he said to me, one night, he said: "There's going to be an event, Aaron, and out of that event, we are going to go into Afghanistan, so we can run pipelines from the Caspian Sea, we are going to go into Iraq to take the oil and establish a base in the Middle East and we are gong to go into Venezuela and get rid of Chavez." The first 2 they have accomplished, Chavez they didn't accomplish. And he said: "You are going to see guys going into caves looking for... looking for people they are never going to find." He was laughing about the fact that you have this war on Terror, and there is no real enemy. He was talking about how by having this war on terror you can never win it, because it is an eternal war, and so you can always keep taking peoples liberties away. And I said: "How are you going to convince people that this war is real?" And he said: "By the media, the media can convince everybody that it's real." You just keep talking about things and saying them over and over and over again and eventually, people believe it. You know, they create the Federal Reserve in 1913 through lies. They create 9/11, which was another lie. Through 9/11, then you are fighting a war on terror and all the sudden you go into Iraq, which was another lie, and now, they are going to do Iran. It's all one thing leading to another, leading to another, leading to another... I would say to him: "What are you doing this for? What's the point of this thing? You have all the money in the world you would ever want, you have all the power, you're hurting people. It's not a good thing." And he would say: "What do you care about the people for? Take care of yourself and take care of your family". And then I said: "So what are the ultimate goals here?" He said: "The ultimate goal is to get everyone in this world chipped with an RFID chip. And have all money be on those chips and have everything on those chips, and if anyone wants to protest what we do or violate what we want, we can just turn off their chip." How far would this sickness of power go?? To what lenghts will those in control go to maintene and preserve their positions We have a Florida family who are really pioneers in a brave new world. They have volunteered to be the first ever, to have microchip identification devices implanted into their bodies. After 9/11, I was really concerned with the security of my family. I wouldn't mind having something planted permanently in my arm, that would identify me. George Orwel. in his famed and posiblly propethic work 1984. stated:" Power is not a needs it is an end. The object of persecusion is the persecusion. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power." Today, simptom of suveillance society continue to grow. As the irational fear of the invisionable enemies coupled, with raising economical instability spread across the globe. It is under discaise?? of securety that we foreshadow a world where everybody is tracked, where everybody is on camera. And everyone is subordinate. The most incredible aspect of all: Such totalitarian will likely not to be forced to the people, rather the people will demand them. For the social manipulation of society, through the generation of fear and division has completely inhibited the culture. Religion. Patriotism. Race. Wealth. Class. And every other form of arbitrary, separatist identification and thus conceit, has served to create a controlled population, utterly malleable in the hands of the few. Divide and Conquer is the motto, and as long as people continue to see themselves as separate from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved. However if people ever realize the truth of their relationship to nature, and the truth of their personal power to affect change. The entire manufactured Zeitgeist they prey upon, will collapse like a house of cards. The whole system that we live in, drills into us that we are powerless, that we are weak, that society is evil, that it's crime ridden and so forth. It is all a big fat lie! We are powerful, beautiful, extraordinary. There is no reason why we cannot understand who we truly are; where we are going. There is no reason why the average individual cannot be fully empowered. We are incredibly powerful beings. I think I spent 30 years of my life, the first 30, trying to become something. I wanted to become good at things, I wanted to become good at tennis and school and grades. And everything I kinda viewed in that perspective, I'm not okay the way I am, but if I got good at things... I realized that I had the game wrong. The game was to find out what I already was. Now, in our culture we have been trained for individual differences to stand out. So you look at each person and the immediate hit is. Brighter, dumber, older, younger, richer, poorer... And we make all these dimensional distinctions, put them in categories and treat them that way. And get so we only see others as separate from ourselves in the ways in which they are separate. And one of the dramatic characteristics of experience is being with another person and suddenly seeing the ways in which they are like you, not different from you. And experiencing the fact that which is essence in you, which is essence in me, is indeed, One. The understanding that there is no other. It is all One. I wasn't born Richard Albert, I was just born as a human being and then I learned this whole business of who I am, and whether I'm good or bad, or achieving or not... All that's learned along the way. The old appeals to racial, sexual and religious shovanism, to rabid nationalistic fervor, are beginning not to work. A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism, and recognizes, that an organism at war with itself is doomed. Bill Hicks used to finish his shows with this: Life's like a ride in an amusement park, and when you go on it, you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down and round and round, it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored. And it's very loud and it's fun for a while. Some have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: Is this real? Or is this just a ride? And other people have remembered and they come back to us and they say: 'Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid ever. Cause this is just a ride.' And we kill those people. Shut him up, I have got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my frowns of worry... Look at my big bank account and my family... This has to be real... It's just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And we let the demons run a muck... But it doesn't matter, because it is just a ride and we can change it anytime we want. It is only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a choice right now. Between fear, and love.
