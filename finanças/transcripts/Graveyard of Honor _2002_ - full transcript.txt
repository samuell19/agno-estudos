The Godfather went to the dentist with a toothache. In the two hours he was gone. . . One yakuza was sent to hell. Hey, guard. . . Think I could go dry out my blanket? I was sweating all night. Wait till laundry day. What if I end up in hospital with pneumonia? I'll complain to the warden. Come on! I'll tell you something you might like to know. Okay, Ishimatsu. . . out. So what would I like to know. Well? I look so young. . . That's you. Boss. . . We're short of dishes. . . Keep it down. Hey, you! Not even 20 and he drinks the Godfather's sake. . . Just shut up about it. He saved Mr. Sawada's life. So that kid's our 'uncle' now?! That's how it is. What do you want? You got business here? Well? I'm Ishimatsu Rikuo. Where's the guy in charge? I'm sorry, 'Uncle!' Excuse me. Capo, it's 'Uncle' Ishimatsu. I'm Tamita, Yoshino Group Capo. Oh. How do you do. I'm Ishimatsu. I'm posted here, starting today. Thanks. 'Night, beautiful. Uh, excuse me. . . Mr. Ishimatsu says. . . . . . he'd like you to come sing karaoke with him at this club. Just a couple of songs. Thanks. Excuse me. . . You must be hungry. Eat. Sit down. Sit down! Eat. You're hungry. Go on, eat. That's right. . . Eat. . . Eat eat eat eat. . . This asshole. Yamone, of the Joto Group. The story is he's going around stirring up trouble. . . . . .because he owes the boss for some gambling debts. You got it! Take two. Who the fuck are you? You're Yamone of the Joto Group? Son of a bitch! Yeah. Hey! Open up, damn it! Come on, open up! I'm going to jail for a while. Come here. Go away. Come here, I said. No. What do you want? Say something. I'm giving this back. Your money. That's for you to live on. Buy some clothes. What. . . . . .am I to you? My wife. Look, you've got to insist you weren't trying to kill him. Intent makes it attempted murder. Otherwise it's just wounding. There's a big difference! You understand that, Mr. Ishimatsu, don't you? I can't say a piss-ass thing like that. I'm a yakuza, Counselor. I asked the boss to look after you. He'll keep you on ice for me. You and Masato don't have to worry about a thing. What's wrong, Hashida? I'll wait it out by myself, thanks. Sitting around on ice like that is too damn boring. I'll wait for you. Piece of cake. Ishimatsu Rikuo served five years for attempted murder. My boss made this garden, 20 years ago. The real 'prison dirt' , huh? Huh? Brother. . . . . .my time's up. I'm getting out. Then we'll drink together on the outside, Brother. It's been fun in here this time. You're a real Brother, Ishimatsu. The pleasure's mine. I got lucky. Well done, ' Elder Brother' . You're working directly for the Godfather now, Masato? I owe you for that. Hell, no. You earned that 'cause you're smart. Well done! Yo, Brother. You're looking good. Thanks, Brother. Masato. . . . . .this is Imamura. He was inside with me. Imamura, Giyu Group. How do you do. Kikawa, Sawada Family. Thank you for coming. No problem. I was waiting for him to get out, too. You know, Rikuo, you remind me of the boss when he was young. Don't be stupid! I never raised hell like he does. Listen to this! You've gone into places with a knife before. Who did? Damn right! Time for a piss. 'Duty calls' . No! Stop it! Help! Somebody! I'm sorry! Welcome home. Oh, ice. . . Eight years went by. The 'post-bubble' era brought tough times to the straight world. . . . . .and to the yakuza. Like lone wolves forced out of the pack. . . . . .there were yakuza driven out of their families. Mari's up to his neck. Yeah, he won't last long. Politicians have family troubles, too. Just like us, huh? What, Ishimatsu? What do you want? Where's Mr. Sawada, Chief? Where's the old man? Damned if I know. Away at a hot spring, maybe? I don't think so. I don't care what you think. He's not here. I don't think so. I don't care what you think. He's not here. What are you doing?! Hey! Yeah? Cut it out! Sakai. . . what happened? I don't know, Boss. So why did Ishimatsu lose it? Tell us! The Chief told him the Boss had gone to a hot spring. . . . . .and Ishimatsu suddenly went nuts. To a hot spring?! The Godfather had a toothache. He went to the dentist! You guys were told that. And to ask 'Uncle' Ishimatsu to wait. Ishimatsu and Mr. Yukawa never got along, you know. Move this shit! Son of a bitch! So what about this money, then? What, Ishimatsu won't get so you want to keep it? I didn't say that. Your coat. . . The Godfather went to the dentist with a toothache. In the two hours he was gone, one yakuza was sent to hell. Excuse me. . . Boss. . . . . .the office has got soldiers out looking for 'Uncle' Ishimatsu. Oh, shit. . . He's probably holed up in a bar. He'll come out, sooner or later. Mr. Yukawa's in critical condition. . . . . .with a fractured skull. Takatsuki and Jo are hurt bad, but they'll live. A fractured skull. . . They're a bunch of bastards. The old man, too. A measly 10 million yen and he doesn't know me any more? Bullshit, Rikuo. Mr. Sawada's not like that. Someone fucked up. No. He didn't want to give me that money. So he fucked off to a hot spring. Hey. . . . . .watch your mouth. You're talking about the head of the Sawada Family. That asshole. . . The first time I ever asked him for anything. . . . . .and he turns his back on me. Stuff that, Rikuo. First you've got to put a lid on this thing right away. Get your ass over to old man Sawada and apologize. Excuse me. . . Boss. . . What? There's some Sawada men out front. Ishimatsu! Wait a minute! Who's in charge? 'Uncle' Narimura? Nishizaki, Yukawa Group. Head Office sent me to find Ishimatsu and Hashida. I thought you might know something. Ishimatsu's here. What?! How about you just hand him over, then? No. 'No'? Then we'll just have to go in and get him, 'Uncle' . They're both here. But you don't touch them in my house. Once they're even a step outside, you can do what you like. But as long as they are in my house, they're my guests. These are orders from the top, from Mr. Sawada himself! Don't pull rank on me! I'm head of the Narimura Group. If you want to get down with me. . . . . .go ahead. I'm ready. We're going! Call Head Office! Man, it's cold! Do you want to eat? Just rice and tea. Where'd he go? He went out the back with Mr. Fujii. You're in a real mess, 'Uncle' . Busting into Head Office and breaking one of the top guys' skull. . . That fucking Yukawa's always pissed me off. Please! We're part of the Sawada Family. You'll screw up the relationship. Then I'll end our relationship as of now. 'Uncle' . Hashida. . . Go find me some cash. Uh. . . okay. Ow! Rikuo? Just a minute. . . Rikuo! Take the damn money! Take it! Finish me off! Finish me off! Rikuo! He knew he'd put the wrong button in the wrong hole. But undoing a button once it's done up. . . . . . is something the yakuza world doesn't allow. So, Chieko. . . . . . how about you let me talk you into coming with me? It'll be something to remember. I'll make it worth your while. Oh, Mr. Kamatsu. . . . . .a girl like me? There you go again! You know I get all worked up when you talk like that! ' He wishes you were younger' . . . Excuse me. . . telephone. Called away? No! I'll just be a minute. Is that all? I'll talk to the Mama-san. Hey. . . . . .what happened? Ogura. . . . . .put your dick into it. Last month. . . . . .your sales were shit. I know. I'll do my best. Hey! Brother! Perfect timing! Come and sit down! Whiskey! This is my Bro. Get him a drink! Brother. . . I just did my old man. The couple living here pissed off on us. You'll be out of sight here. Hello? Yeah? Ok, thanks. Let's have a drink. Thanks. ' Bye. Mr. Sawada's okay. You missed the vital organs. A hair's breath between the old man being alive or dead. . . That's the distance between heaven and hell. Damn right. Huh, Brother? Get some beer and some food. Got money? So now what? Try to kill your boss and it's game over. The Sawadas are going to be coming for him. Ishimatsu's my brother. I won't just stand there. You don't often look like a saint. It looks good on you. So what do we do about the Sawadas? When push comes to shove, we fight. I'm Imamura, Giyu Group. Blood? 80 over 50 at 95. Thanks for coming. So Ishimatsu was at your place last night? Yeah. If you'd given him up then, this wouldn't have happened. That's what our guys are saying. So it's my fault? I'm not saying that. However. . . . . .this is going to give some people big ideas. ' Big ideas'? Like what? Mr. Narimura. . . the Boss has always left you a lot of space. Yeah. So what? Some people might think. . . . . .that you helped Ishimatsu get away. . . . . .because maybe you owed the Godfather some money. Fuck you! There's only so much I'll take. Okay. You want Ishimatsu's head? You just wait! I'll fucking bring it to you, then! Move! Narimura and Ishimatsu have always been tight. A wedge in there might be a good thing. I started out working for 'Uncle' Ishimatsu. Which means it's time to prove yourself, Kikawa. To show if you can tell heads from tails. Meaning what, Capo? We're getting up a posse to go after him. Perhaps you could lead it. You're saying it's my fault the Godfather got shot? Well. . . . . . if the shoe fits, wear it. You're a Narimura man. What are you doing here? Huh? Go ' huh' yourself! You know where Ishimatsu is, don't you. You know, don't you. How about I mess up that pretty face for you? What the fuck are you doing?! ' Elder Sister' . . . I don't know. I don't know anything! I told you, we haven't seen him. Crap. Someone saw your boss. . . . . .drinking with him at a foreign-hostess bar. If we don't know, we don't know. Maybe the Sawada Family might like to. . . . . .bring that 'someone' who saw him here in person. Ishimatsu's been kicked out of the Sawada Family. If you were to hide him. . . . . .that would light a fire between us. . . . . .and the Giyu Group. Are you looking for trouble? All right. Mr. Imamura, could you contact our head office. . . . . .when you see ' Big Brother' Ishimatsu? Sure. I'll do that. Welcome. Naomi. . . did you get the money? You'll want a beer, won't you. We'll get a new ashtray, too. You'll want to smoke. Look, did you get the money? What about the money? Hashida! On your fucking feet! Spill it, Hashida. Where's that bastard Ishimatsu? Where's he hiding out?! I'll fucking kill you! Come on, sing! You want to die? Come on, Hashida, talk! We'll kill you, you know. I don't know where he is. That's the truth. Where'd you see him last? At a bar near Mr. Narimura's place. . . What did he want that 10 million yen for? The Mama-san at the bar Miss Chieko works at. . . . . .wants to retire and sell her business. So what do we do with him, 'Uncle'? Take his thumb. No, both of them. Hold him down. The right one. . . This damn thing won't cut. Hold him! It's nice and sunny. The food's not very hot. Let's forget about the bar. I can't raise the money. I don't mind. Buying it was your idea. What's wrong? Can I throw this out? Who did it? I fell. Tell me. What the fuck!? Get him! Siddown! Sit the fuck down! Okay, you're on watch here. You don't set foot outside. Until when? Until you die. Hey! The phone's ringing. Pick up the damn phone! Are you stupid or what? Hello? No. This is a noodle shop. Born of women, even yakuza are human beings. And as human beings, they belong to a social structure. . . . . .whose rules they must follow. All there is for those who break those rules is the demon's path. . . . . .of impulse, of continuing to breathe, of wandering towards. . . . . .a demon's death. 'Uncle' . . . But those are my chips! More chips. You're already into us for Y4 million. If you don't clear that off the books. . . Just bring me some chips. I can't let you do that. Even this money here leaves you a million short. 'Uncle'! Tezuka! What's with these accounts? I'm sorry. Ishimatsu took 3 million yen. What?! Yeah? We've got trouble. Mr. Ishimatsu was here and. . . If you don't like it, go home, you bitch! He's locked himself in a hotel room with some girls. . . Hey, Brother. Wanna have some fun. . . Brother? You know damn well. . . . . .that we run Baccarat House and that white girls club. What did you bastards ever do. . . . . .for me? That's bullshit. Me and the Boss have busted ass for you. So what have you done for me? Stuck me in a room in the middle of nowhere. . . . . .and left me there. That's not very friendly. Is that any way to treat a brother? If you want me the hell out of here. . . . . .just say so. Hey. . . . . .drive him home. Sure, Boss. He's fucked. He's onto needles now. And looking like that, it's not speed, either. It's H. You know, Hayashi. . . . . .I think I'll go and talk to our Godfather. Talk to him? About what? Ishimatsu's right. We haven't done anything for him. What can we do for him? He was kicked out for shooting his old man! If we get involved, it could blow up in our faces. And if this Joe Schmoe was to shoot me. . . . . .what would you do about it, Imamura? If that happened, I wouldn't leave him alive. You'd whack him for me, then? Of course. I'd do whatever it takes. It doesn't add up. You think he's a great guy and the Sawadas want him dead. If the Godfather puts his nose into this fight. . . . . .there's a good chance that we could get caught. . . . . . in the crossfire. How would you take responsibility for that, Mr. Imamura? A yakuza who loses the plot isn't worth shit. Imamura, there's no help for a guy like this Ishimatsu. I'm bored! And I'm hungry! You are? Let's go get something to eat, then. What would you like? Croquettes. Croquettes? Ok, babe. Croquettes it is. I've stuck my foot in it. How could I be so stupid? Because you know what honor is. You're the only one who'd say that. Well, don't get down over it. All we can do now is send him to the Philippines or somewhere. Check it out, will you? Hey. . . Sir? I'll handle it. Something to eat! Your table's ready. Look after them. Your table's ready, sir. Look, will you move your car from out front? It's in the way. Excuse him. . . Shut up, you old bitch. What did you say? 'You old bitch. ' Who do you think you are, talking to me like. . . Bam! You bastard! I hear you want to talk to me, Oshita. Cold, ain't it. Sure is. Detective Aoyama. . .about Ishimatsu Rikuo. . . You want him, don't you. And what do you want for him? Nothing. We're going in. Pull back! Go get him. Out of bullets! I'm out! No bullets! No bullets. Chieko, I'm out of bullets. Hey, Chieko! I'm out of bullets, Chieko. I'm out of. . . Chieko? Police today arrested former gang member Ishimatsu Rikuo, 36. . . . . .wanted on charges of attempted murder. . . . . .at the apartment in which he was hiding. Ishimatsu, barricaded in a room with his common-law wife. . . . . .was captured after a dramatic gunfight. Shit! How did they find him? He wasn't trying very hard to stay hidden. The cops aren't stupid. Brother. . . . . .I can't help you now. The police got Ishimatsu this morning. I'm sorry, Boss. We didn't finish him off. Excuse me. Hey. . . You don't have to go, Kikawa. As of today you stay here. Sure, Boss. How long are you going to hang tough? You're the guy who shot old man Sawada, aren't you. Is that what he says? He wouldn't say that. He's a yakuza boss. So who did shoot him, then? You don't have a witness. . . We've got something called 'circumstantial evidence' . Enough of it to burn. Then file the damn charge without a confession, then. Don't be like that. Just give me a report I can write up. I'll make it look good for you, Mr. Ishimatsu. Okay, then. . . . . .tell me. . . . . .the name of the dickhead who sold me out. Was it Imamura? He's the only one who knew. Well, you're in the ballpark, anyway. And I'm the one who hit up the woman. I want you to believe that. Yeah, sure. I'll do what I can. 'Prosecution delayed' . . . good deal, huh? Good luck. Help! Help me! What's going on here? All's well? All's well. Hey! What are you doing?! Boss! Boss! Boss! It's Mr. Ishimatsu! Brother! Okay, okay. . . The shape he's in, he's lucky he made it here. Can you save him? I've done what I can. The rest depends on how strong he is. Or how lucky. Do whatever you have to, but bring him back. Ishimatsu Rikuo is still at large. He is thought to be armed with a stolen pistol. The police have issued an all points bulletin. . . . . .but have found no sign of him. Turning to other news. . . Brother! What's the matter? That was a dirty trick. Turning me in. What are you talking about? Shut up. Boss. . . Boss! The bastard. . . . . .turned on me. After everything you did for him! Tezuka's dead. Gimme. Mr. Ishimatsu! Quick! And works. A needle! Hold it! Boss! No! Stop it! Kozo! Son of a bitch! Excuse me. Thanks. This isn't good for me. Mr. Kikawa. . . could I see you? What's going on? He's got the whole committee in there! What's going on? He's got the whole committee in there! He wants 100 million yen! We just heard shots from in there! Okay. . . none of you guys move. In the end, he didn't die. . . . . .though in spirit he had long been gone. His body simply refused to admit it. He did? Okay. Godfather. . . Ishimatsu killed himself. A bad kid. . . Hey, Watanabe! Slow down! No one'll see me in my limousine! Break! Hot tea! I only found out Ishimatsu Rikuo was dead. . . . . .two years later.
