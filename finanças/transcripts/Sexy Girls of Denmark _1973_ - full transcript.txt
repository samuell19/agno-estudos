- This way, please. - Okay. This way... Master. Well, what would you both like to drink? No, thanks... We've had a bit too much on the flight. - This thing we were going to see, is it ready? - Yes, it's ready. - Let's watch it right away. - Okay. Ah San, if you could please guard the door. No one should come in this room. We have a very important meeting here. Secretary Huang. Secretary Huang, we would like to watch the Book of Rites. - It's the original version. - Master, it's ready. Good, let's move to the next room. Madam, Miss. Where is master? - Having a meeting. - With whom? With some three aged gentlemen. One of them is Mr. Qian. Mr. Qian from India. - About what? - Abalones. They are huge. Like a pair of huge Abalones. They look delicious. These are nothing. I like fresh Abalones. They taste much better. Right. Mr. Qian is well-experienced. He knows what tastes better. He is gluttonous. Ah San, if they stay for dinner, - tell the cook to have some Abalones. - Okay. - Mum, i like Abalones. - Okay. Oh boy, some position that is! It really is... ...very enjoyable. When i was young, I knew of a position too I used it on so many girls. What is it? It is awesome. Mr. Qian knows a lot he knows of an unfathomable posture. I know a position too. What is it? It is called rear-entry. I didn't know papa is versed in martial arts. He's talking nonsense. Don't listen to him. We are old men now. We can't sleep alone with our cold feet. Don't worry, Mr. Qian I've already told Secretary Huang to find three pretty... ...young girls for you to warm your feet at night. So very thoughtful of you! You are lucky to arrive today, because... I'm going to leave for Denmark the day after. For what? The agent contract is going to expire. It has got to be renewed. How could you? Our wives won't let us come to HK often. Mr. Qian comes from afar I certainly ought to entertain you well I can ask my son Kwok-chuen... to go to Denmark on behalf of me. Father, this is too important. I... I am afraid... Don't be afraid. I'm sending you there... because i trust you can do it. You are twenty something now. You should have more confidence in yourself. I began working when i was 14. Men are meant to experience more, to see more, or how else would you mature? You are right. Say... wasn't it hard to work when you were 14? Yes, it was miserable. Sometimes, i had not enough to eat. See... ...how great your father is. He worked hard to build up his business, so you can live comfortably. But he is sort ofjealous. He is a sick man. He can't stand that you live comfortably. He wants you to work hard like him. Begin working when you're in your teens. He wants you to live miserably like him. Listen to me, honey. You were born in a poor family. Kwok-chuen was not. Your father was poor. But Kwok-chuen's is rich. Your mother didn't give you a damn. She is howling again. Kwok-chuen's mother loves him dearly. How can i... Why are you laughing? It's nothing. What you say does make sense. Please continue... I won't let Kwok-chuen go to Denmark, which is far away. - You... - What? Father, mother, stop this. Father sends me there only because... he wants me to broaden my horizon. Going to Denmark is not miserable at all I am just afraid, i can't finish the job and might let father down. Don't worry. The three agencies we are going to meet all have their own strong points. You just choose the one which has most to offer. And sign with them. Father, i want to go with brother. You? Look at yourself. What? I look quite grown-up with the moustache. Nonsense. Your father doesn't keep a moustache... How dare you keep one? Let me tell you. If you don't shave off your moustache... One day, i will pull them out one by one. Yeah... one fine day your mom will pull it out. Kwok-chuen. Mum. When you are in Denmark, Eat every meal on time and don't catch a cold in your sleep. Don't worry Mum, i understand. - I am not a little boy now. I will take care of myself. - And... Enough of it. He is not a little boy now. He is my son. He is an outstanding young man. Outstanding? Just like you, short, fat and clumsy. What? Am i wrong? No, you are right. What are you doing? You, in this house... ...are like her. And i am like her. The whole family listens to you. Sweetie, don't be cross. Or you'll have a stomachache. Kwok-chuen, would you go to Denmark? Yes, father. Then i'll telegraph and let them know. Sit down. Thank you. Right. The management of Hong Kong Universal... is sending a representative here to look us over. According to our contacts... we know their product is in big demand. And now that our agency contract is up for renewal... we should expect severe competition for sure. Now this is a golden opportunity. We'll have to obtain this valuable agency. Although we are not sure... ...if we can acquire the agency. But we have to try our best. Right. - Do you have... - First, we have to draft a proposal. Now i understand that... Mr. Fung, the boss of Universal, likes girls. So, we'll play on his weakness to get that contract. Wait. I think it's his son Fung Kwok-chuen who is coming. That's the problem. As they say, "Like father like son". And with a really sexy girl to help us out. That contract is in the bag. And here she is now. Great, huh? Perfect. So all we need is an attractive blonde. And the agency is ours. I got it. Ann Charlotte. Mr Fung Kwok-chuen. Please go to the information desk. Mr Fung Kwok-chuen, please go to the information desk. Mr Fung Kwok-chuen, please go to the information desk. - Excuse me. Are you Mr Fung? - Yes. My Card. - How do you do? - How do you do? And this is my private secretary, Ms. Kjoller. - How do you do? - How do you do? I am very happy to meet you. Well, if there is anything at all you need... you just ask me, anything at all. Thank you, thank you very much. I think Mr Fung is very tired, so i suggest... you talk to him at the Royal Hotel, alright? Mr Fung, this is your room here. It is beautiful. - So do you like it? - Yes - I hope you find it comfortable. - Yes. - And this is your bedroom. - Thank you. I hope you like it here. Don't you think Copenhagen is beautiful? Let me see. - It is beautiful. - And am i beautiful too? Yeah, you are very beautiful. Am i? Oh, it is cold! I know how to warm you up. Baby, has some heat. Are you all right? Yes, thank you. I want to take a bath. Jeez, why're the girls here so hot? Shall i wash your back? Mr Fung. Mr Fung. Am i so ugly, that i scare you off? No, you are beautiful. Thank you. - Is there anything i can help you with? - I bring you a proposal. If you have time, i... Darling, where are you going to? Hello. Hello. Mr Fung. Hello. Mr Fung, why the big hurry? Nothing. Would you like a cup of coffee with me? - Yes, all right. - Come on. Mr Fung, what's wrong with you? I am scared of that dame. She is a lot too hot to me. Really? In fact, i'd like to change rooms, just to get away from her. That's easy. All you have to do is to phone her company... ...to ask them to take her away. That's all I can't. That would be impolite. Oh, no, it wouldn't be. All right, i will go and phone. Right. All fixed up? Everything is okay. Good, by the way, would you like to come to a party? Oh, sure. Yes, yes... Hey, look at him. This is my friend, George. This is Peter. He is cute. Let's go over there. Come on. This is Anna. How do you do? Hi, good looking, care to dance? Why is she holding me so tight? I can't control myself! Oh, i'm sorry. Thank you. Have you got a torch in your pocket? No. Thank you. Where is the toilet? Toilet? It is right there. Thank you. H, her... must be Ladies. Then D must mean man's. Sorry... No one would come. I can't hold it. I don't care. Hey, you. Make love not war. It's real cute. Be careful. It is a gun. Hands up! Mother, don't worry about me I have breakfast here everyday. Your brother has breakfast everyday even in Denmark. You're so unfair, mom just because he has breakfast everyday. We too have breakfast everyday, but you never praise us for that. It's different. You eat because i am here watching you. Your brother listens to me even in Denmark. He is a good kid. You must learn from him. Good morning. By the way, what's your name? My name is Kwok-chuen. Kwok-chuen? Yes, and what's your name? Ann Charlotte. Ensaw... No, Ann Charlotte. Ensaw... Oh, no, Ann Charlotte. Enswa... oh, forget it I will call you Wawa instead. Wawa? Yeah. What does Wawa mean? It means a beautiful doll. That is sweet. Would you teach me a bit of Chinese? Yes, of course i will. - What is this? - Yanjing. - Yanjing. - Yes. - And this? - Bizi. - Bizi? - Yes. - And this? - Zuiba. - Zuiba? - Yeah. - And this? - Nainai. - Nainai? - Yes. - And this? - Duqi. - Duqi? - Yes.

Yeah. Yanjing, yanjing. Bizi, Zuiba. Nainai, nainai. Duqi, Chipan. You are so clever. I am going to teach you a song Chinese song? I am not going home tonight. Those lonely hearts. And those hesitant men. Don't you forget... ...the sweetness of family ...of family I am not going home tonight. La... Don't you forget the sweetness of family. I am not going home tonight. I must go. George, it's too late. I have to go to the studio. - Studio? - Yes. Catch him... Quick, don't let him run away... - What are you doing? - Don't let him run away. - What are you doing? - Come sit down. - Hold him. - Okay. Mum, please don't shave off my moustache. You're lucky I don't pull it out by its roots. Mum, it doesn't feel cool without one I don't care. You look awful with it. What are you doing? The shaver. Mum. Mum, please don't... No, Mum. Mum, please don't... Hurry, Mum. Mum, please don't. Madam... Letter. Master Kwok-chuen's letter. Master Kwok-chuen's letter. Mum, read it to us. Mother I have a good news for you. When you come to know, you could react in two ways. You will either be happy or angry. I hope you will feel happy for me. If you feel angry, please be understanding and don't stop me I've met a beautiful girl here in Denmark. She is a movie star. Her name is Wawa. Wawa? We'll come back to Hong Kong to get married. Enclosed please find her photograph. Mother, i do hope you'll like her. I will have a daughter-in-law. Great! Angry. Old man. Yes. You want to frighten me. Your son is marrying a Danish girl. It's good. - Beg your pardon? - I said it's good. No, i won't allow Kwok-chuen to marry a Denmark girl. What difference does it make, marrying a Denmark girl and a Chinese girl? She is his wife, not yours or mine. We have different cultures and lifestyles and besides, i don't speak English. What are you afraid of? You can learn it from your grandchildren. They will call me grandpa... and you... grandma. Grandpa, grandma I don't like it. Come on, don't be stubborn. It's the 20th century. The important thing is they love each other. They will spend their lives together. We cannot take care of them all the time. Yeah, right... Don't be mad. Let them be. Look. She's almost wearing nothing! Kwok-chuen wants us to take a closer look. Let me see. She has a great body. They are huge. Yeah. You moron. Kwok-chuen knows how to pick his wife. What? She has a pointed nose... ...and a big mouth. You don't understand. It's sexy I don't give it a damn. She looks familiar. It's really her. I won't let Kwok-chuen marry this girl. No, not that girl. Hey, why the sudden change? Father, you're going back on your words. A while back you said yes and now 'No'? Yeah. Papa, you can't contradict yourself. You don't understand. Do you all know what she does? - She's a Movie star. - Movie star, my foot. She is a porno actress. Father, you can stop brother marrying her. - But you can't insult her. - I am not insulting her. It's true. - You have proof? - Proof? I saw her porno movie before. You saw it before? I not only saw it, but also own a copy. Since when did you have such a dirty mind? My dear. We are not talking about me. The most important thing now is to stop Kwok-chuen from marrying her. That's simple. You go there and bring him home right now. We can't do this. If we take him home by force, it will reflect badly on our relationship. Let me think. Jingyi, you go there. Tell him the truth and dissuade him. What if brother won't listen to me? Then you phone me immediately. I will bring him home myself. Put me down. Jingyi, it's you? You thought i was that Denmark girl. Why didn't you tell me you are coming? You see, i've been given a task. Take a seat. Where are you staying? Next door to you. Did you receive my letter? What did father say? - He told me to come here to take you home. - Why? Because your fiancee... ...is a porno actress. What? I said, your fiancee... ...is a porno actress. - Nonsense. - It is true. - Father has a copy of her movie. - What? - I don't believe it. - Go ask her. Hello? Hold the line, please. Hello. Ann Charlotte, please. Yes. Yeah. Yes, thank you. What? She has gone to the studio. - Where are you going? - To find her. No. No. No... Cut. Camera here. All right, we will take it again. Ready. Action. Easy. Ah, cool it, baby. Camera roll. No, let me go. Help... Help. No. See? Cut that out. Stop it. I insist you must stop this. Come home with me right away. You must be out of your mind. Now get off the set. Now listen, you get out of this. This is between Wawa and me. You get out or i'll have you thrown out. Brother. Okay. Listen, i will give you anything... if only you agree to release Wawa from this film. But why? Have you gone crazy? I don't want to be released. I love this job. I do. - Now you listen to me... - Out. Before i knock you out. Let's go. Are you coming with me? No, of course not. I am sorry. Let's get back to work, huh. Brother. She isn't worth it. Let me tell you. Don't insult her in front of me. Where are you going? I'm going to meet her. Darling. Who's that? George. Pleased to see you. Hi. This is my sister, Jane. Sit down, have a drink? Thank you. Thank you very much. - A drink? - No, thank you. All right. Listen, i am sorry about this afternoon. - It's just... - Oh, forget it. But you don't understand. I behaved badly. You must be angry with me. Angry? What about? How can i expect you to come away with me... ...when i upset you? Tell me that? Away with you? Darling, i'm serious. Please give up this life of movie-making I have so much to offer. Money, beautiful house, all you can wish for. Yeah, all i can wish for, except what i want. How can you want more than i can offer? You can't offer anything better than i have I like it here. Why should i go to Hong Kong? Why? So that we can marry. Marry? I told my parents. They object because of yourjob. But still we must get married. We must get married? You pregnant? Anyway, i don't love you. But you must. Otherwise, why did you go to bed with me? Do you think you are the only man in my life? Do you think you are the big romance i dream about. Listen, i won't be tied down now. I want to come and go exactly as it pleases me ...including going to bed if i want to. It's as simple as that. No... it isn't true. You can't go to bed unless you are in love! Darling, what the hell is keeping you so long? Oh, you? You, get out before i smash you. Brother, let's go. Darling. George, you are always welcome. Good Luck. Where to go i don't know I just want to forget myself I find you nowhere. Why? Why would i fall in love with you. Why? Why can't i forget you I won't take you back, i swear. You are lovable. You are damnable. No, i don't want to think of you. The romance we had. The sweetness we shared. All turned into heart-breaking memories. It becomes a landscape in the dream. Why? Why would i fall in love with you. Why? Why can't i forget you I won't take you back, i swear. You are lovable. You are damnable. No, i don't want to think of you. The wanderer always moves around. Stands alone at the crossroads. Once again you seem to be in my arms I remember only your charm. Why? Why would i fall in love with you. Why? Why can't i forget you I won't take you back, i swear. You are lovable. You are damnable. No, i don't want to think of you. Get out... Miss. Can you leave me alone? Can you? I am talking to you. Do you hear me? You don't have to yell at me. Dad told me to keep an eye on you. Dad? Are you trying to intimidate me? Don't you dare say it again. Say it again. Say it again. I won't say it, Okay? Why are you so angry? Jingyi, go back to your room. I beg of you. Go back to your room, please. I won't annoy you here. Get out. Please, don't cry... Listen, don't cry. You go there and have a sauna. I will wait for you here. Go on. I promise i will wait for you. Go now. It's at the corner. You can't go in. Take a shower first. I am sorry? Come with me. This is the shower. Let me have your towel. I'll keep it for you. There's nothing to worry about. We are all girls. No... Hey, guy, are you Chinese? What do you think? I am sorry. I'm really sorry I don't like drinking with a Chinese who doesn't care to speak Chinese. I am glad to hear that. I am sorry. My name is Daniu. What's your name? Fung. Brother Fung, let's have a drink. - Where are you from? - Hong Kong. - How long have you been here? - More than 20 days. Got any girlfriends? Let's drink. Women and wine are inseparable. Do you like any of those girls? My treat. Say, which one do you fancy? This one. And that one. Okay, i will ask them out. Brother Fung, let's go. Where to? Come on. Let's go. Thank you. Oh, yes. More. Come on. Which one do you prefer? Tell me. I am not picky. Come on. Why did they take off their pants but not their shirts? Your shirts? More money. All right... Why did you give them money? They won't take off their shirts if not. Some chicks charge you for that. Come on. We do it in the same room? Yeah. They are roommates. Don't be shy. Come on... Come on. Where are you going? I am not used to... Don't be shy. No, i can't... Then wait for me outside. Okay... You will have to wait for quite a while. Okay. Brother Fung. Don't worry. I promise you i will wait. I am here. Are you done? Yeah. I haven't finished my cigar. I took care of them both, you know. Let me tell you. Girls here are easy. Some will throw themselves at you. Throw themselves at you? Come in. Mr Fung. Hello. Throw themselves at you! You are... My name is Yang. Thank you. Ms Yang, how do you do? Mr Fung, how do you do? Please take a seat. Please sit.

Put on the coat. I have been here for some days, but haven't had any chance to do sightseeing. If you have time, would you show me around? All right. This is my sister Jingyi. This is Ms Yang. Ms Yang. Are you going out? Yes. Would you like to come? Yes. So you are the God of Fertility? If i was the God of Fertility, you would be very busy. How come? You will bear many children. You have many brothers and sisters. It must be fun. It must not be easy for you and your brother ...to get a firm foothold in a foreign country. Let's not talk about this issue. The day after tomorrow is Christmas. Do you have any plans? Will i have any plans? I am asking you. I am asking you too. Why? I've given everything to you. - Really? - Yes. Then i will sell you to someone. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I got some wine here. Let's light up some candles and turn off the lights. What is it? Nothing. You can't see it. Let me see it. Let me see it. No, you can't. I must see it. Let me see it. You can't see it. You really can't. Let me see it. Let me... Let me see it... Let me. The candles are so cute. They are like two feet. Why didn't you want me to see them? Why? - What are you hiding? - Oh, i was just kidding I won't listen. You have so many good things. It's cute. I got dizzy. Go to the bed and lie down. Don't touch me. He must have planned it. No wonder he kept telling me to drink. Why am i so stupid. I can tell with his look. It's like he wants to swallow me. Be careful. Don't let him come close. You think all girls are loose. They will go to bed with you when you ask them. I tell you i won't. Women... women are all the same. Don... Don't touch me. I won't touch you. Morning. Brother Fung. Sorry, can you wait for me at the restaurant - I'll get dressed and meet you there. - I have had my breakfast. Then... I got a friend in there. - Is she your girlfriend? - Yes. She threw herself at you? You are such a Casanova. - Let me take you to lunch then. - Thanks. Drink? - Anything will do. - Ok. Brother, you... How about you? Nothing... Your brother? So it is... What's wrong? It's all your fault. What have i done? How dare you? - Why was my brother here? - He... Sorry, lady. Sorry. Where are you going in such a hurry? - Just taking a stroll. - Where are you from? I'm from Hong Kong. - Let me be your guide? - Why not? - Brother. - Brother. Jingyi, why are you with my brother?

You wait for us in the restaurant. - Okay. - I need to talk to your brother. You go first. Okay. - We will wait for you there. - Okay. Let's go. You are good. We can't fight in a public area. Come with me if you want to fight. If you don't mind. Go ahead. You are such a disgraceful jerk. God, how could you be so spiteful? Let me tell you, my sister is not a loose girl. What? My sister isn't a cheapy either. I told you to play with foreign girls... How dare you frolic with my sister and accuse me of being disgraceful. I am not playing. I want to marry her. I... What?

There is no problem on my side I look forward to working with you. Same here. Mr Yang, i have to ask for your permission - I would like... - To marry Jiaojiao? Thank you. Brother, would you... It is okay with me if it is okay with Jiaojiao. Of course she's okay with it. If Jiaojiao didn't want to marry him, she wouldn't bring him here. You... Go after her... Excuse me. Why are you laughing? You learn from your travels. It's so true. I have seen a lot here... ...and have learnt a lot. And i will marry a beautiful girl. You've had your wild days - I didn't. - You didn't? You forgot. I saw a beautiful and sexy girl when i went to see you the first time. She was in your room. Why was that? It was a business meeting. You paid her or was it the other way around? Oh, c'mon now, don't try to be funny! Hey wait... Tell me the truth. No, i did nothing like that. I swear. - No? Really? - No. - Made no Danish girlfriends here? - There was one though. - Tell me, who was she? - I won't tell you. You will be cross I won't. Let bygones be bygones, i won't be mad at you. Good. That's good. Then let's put our past behind us. Did you hurt yourself? Got you. It hurts. You're not my wife yet and you're acting like one. Because you are not honest. Tell me. Who was she? You promise you won't be pissed. Her name is Ann Charlotte I give her a Chinese name. Wawa. The beautiful women of Copenhagen. The handsome Chinese men. Yanjing, bizi and zuiba. Nainai, duqi, and the B. Do you think you are the only man in my life? Do you think you are the big romance i dream about. Listen, i won't be tied down now. I want to come and go exactly as it pleases me... ...including going to bed if i want to. It's as simple as that. We had some happy moments. From her i learned that we think and see things differently. I liked her a lot. I want to meet her. Let's have a party and invite her. This is Jiaojiao... meet Wawa. How do you do? Nice to see you. - This is Peter. - Hello. Oh, of course you've met. But you haven't met Jiaojiao yet, now have you? Shall we dance? Brother. Here they come. C'mon, let's go over there.
