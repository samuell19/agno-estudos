The Count of Marsay! Who will die in five years, victim of a too passionate life. -Hello! -Are you all right, Marsay? I'm perfectly well. I'm ardently fine! Are you watching the door? Yes. My sister asked me a favor. She's showing an Egyptian mummy to General de Montriveau. Montriveau, at Madame de Sérizy's? The enemy of the world? What could he want more than a beautiful woman? I tell you, a mummy. The Duke of Grandlieu! Who’ll die within the year of a fall off a horse in the forest of Compiègne. Today's a “vision day”! Yes. There is nothing better than a gala to see the fate that's been written on their foreheads. How’s your health, Duke? Extraordinary, as I eat woodcock salami all the time. It's a terrible gift you have. Your sister shouldn't keep you here to stick death tags on the foreheads of her stoutest guests. I am the second footman. First they’re announced to me. Then I announce them to God. Miss Paquita Valdès. The girl with the golden eyes. Who will be murdered before the fall. Good morning, Mr. de Ronquerolles. Good morning, Mr. de Marsay. Life is beautiful, right? In your light, yes. Madame de Blamont-Chauvry. Who will never die, that one! Who’ll be found frozen in her bed on a winter's morning. Hello, little ones. -Where’s your sister, Ronquerolles? -Where’s Pérotine? The greenhouse, with a General and a mummy. In the greenhouse. She's smart. It's not warm here. Is my niece here? No. The Duchess de Langeais likes making her entrance when her court is complete. Good! If you must greet our Duchess with one of your dire predictions, it's best for her to wait until you are relieved of your duties. I don't know in advance what I'll see, believe me. The Duchess has all the virtues and faults that avert a fatal destiny. Of course! She is frivolous but charming, light but witty. She is a coquette, but wise. -You know that as well as I do! -And everyone else! Yes, all of us. Not one of us has not courted her. And not one that she has not discouraged. Mrs. Caroline de Vanderesse. Count de la Chanterie. At last, let's declare love! Alas! In three months, Caroline will have left the world. -Is she going to die? -No. Her fiancé will leave her for the little Rochefide. General de Montriveau is here, Mr. de Ronquerolles. I am curious to get to know him. Come on, Caroline! Marsay, I'd like you to arrange for the Duchess de Langeais to never meet Montriveau. Why not? He is the only one who risks nothing. The French campaign, the Russian. Five years in Africa and Arabia have made him a loner who is difficult to defeat. Besides, I think Paris needs one real love story. There are only liaisons and intrigues. These two can give it to us. Mr. de Cinq-Cygne! The King has let you come? Yes. He will be pleased with my report. He likes his favorite Duchess to be the queen of our evenings. The Duchess of Langeais. -Who before six months… -Shut up! Good evening, Ronquerolles. Your arm, Marsay. The Vicomtesse de Fontaine. The Comtesse de Manerville. Madame d'Espard. No! There are too many! I give up. Let them go to the devil unannounced. Caroline, why are you here among all these ugly women with houses and husbands? In three months I’ll be like them. The house is not yet found, but here is the future husband. He is very good. You found him with the heart, and with the eyes. Good evening. How I admire you! Because of my hair? You're right, you are. It's the triumph of Hippolyte. Because of your hair, yes! And because of your power over men. Nobody has power over men, not even them. Yes, you do. They are all yours. And you belong to no one. I belong to a husband. But you don't have one. You haven't seen him for three years. You hate him and rightly so. He's your scarecrow against the naive ones. But you are not his! I belong in the world. Montriveau is here! My dears, what an adventurer! -The Arab? -Yes. The one from the deserts and Arabian nights. Our friend Léontine lured him tonight as you’d lure a wild beast, with corpses. What are you talking about? With this Egyptian mummy installed in the small salon. -He is with her, examining her. -No, he's not! -Will see him, Marsay? -Dear Madam. Let's go and look for Marquis de Montriveau. Tell him I’ll be glad to know him. Yes, yes. Bring him back to us, bound hand and foot. No. As he is, on the loose. He looks terrible. They say no one’s more boring, no one darker. But he is fashionable. Oh, Marsay signals that Montriveau doesn’t want to come. How rude! We want to introduce him to the prettiest girls in Paris and he refused. His mane! Cry, my eyes. Dry your tears, lovelies. I am bringing him to you. Naturally, there's Antoinette. -General? -One moment, if you please? General, if you press this button, a secret door opens. You can disappear down a staircase that leads to the garden. Very good. The intruders are coming. Please, hurry. I am. She is very beautiful, isn't she? Extraordinarily beautiful. It is about three thousand years old. She has what beauty has: eternity. Who are you? And now, Mr. de Montriveau, use the secrets of our hostess. Here are the intruders. Take the back stairs. You’re Madame de Langeais. Go. I know that you hate the world. You're not someone who gets trapped. I don't like the world. But they say you rule it. So it is worthy of homage. I don't know if I rule it, but I love that. I love it because I owe it to the best of my friends. We women, we don’t find friends in a profession, in a war. We have to wait for the world to bring them to us. A happy ball for us, is the one where, among the known faces, a new sign appears, a new face. This must be very rare. Antoinette has never made such a charge for anyone. What does he look like in front of her? As a lieutenant, if I can judge from the fire in his eyes! The dead recall their dead queen, the living their living queen. I don't know if these few moments were enjoyable enough to allow me to invite you to my home, but I’d be happy to see you there. You will always find me there in the evenings, until ten o'clock. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. She's a lot less interesting, right? Yes. It's taken ages! The Duchess is not a bad woman, but look how well she kills the dead. Everyone is talking about you, after your triumph over Antoinette. Thank you. Farewell. Suzette! Mr. Marquis, follow me, please. Madame. Excuse me, I have a bad headache. I would have asked a friend not to go up. A friend? Or an indifferent one. Thank you for the favor, but I've greeted you. I'm leaving. Leaving? Have you come for a formal visit? Certainly not. Isn't this a step towards friendship? Intimacy? Madam, if I have come… Would you put the wick on that lamp? Here it is, Madame. You said… You said, “If I have come”. If I came, madam. It was to see if there was any sincerity in my sympathy. No. I believed it, madam. You’re preparing a compliment. Say it without fear. From you I shall be pleased. I have lived in the East. A woman's worth is measured by her feet. Of a slave. You value mine in pearls? In ducats? No. I'm thinking of an Arabic poem. -Can we hear it? -Oh, yes, we can. It's short. “Earth, be it light It weighs so little on you.” It's beautiful, a journey that leaves you with a poem. I have indeed had harder ones. You have suffered, you have admired, you have loved. I have suffered, I have admired, I have never loved. That's curious. Why is that? Love is not included in the travel plan. It is curious that a man always thinks he has to tell us out of courtesy that he has never loved. But I have never loved! Too bad! We, women, would like to think that a man, whom we suspect to be strong, sensitive and loyal, has not scorned us to this extent. Are you really sincere in saying this? When men have loved out of mere politeness, they forget. Don't you believe me? Yes, I believe you. I'll believe anything you tell me. I will believe that you are now someone who will never love. That's not precisely what I said. The reason I came, madam, is… It's to make a habit of coming every night, I hope. Until tomorrow. Come in, Cinq-Cygne. Come in. Sire! Montriveau is on a rampage today. In just ten minutes he has proposed a rifle that shoots ten bullets at once, an expedition to Spain to consolidate the Bourbons and a system of ships that run on boiling water. It's too much for one day. Are you like this every morning, Montriveau? I have faith this morning, sire. Faith in me or in you? In you, sire, and in life! For Algiers and the Barbary pirates. Tell me about the Barbary Coast on Wednesday, after the council. A man in love, very nice. It will be less pretty in a few weeks. In any case, Paris is preparing a beautiful show. I’ve kept you waiting. We only wait for those who are absent. You were already here, with me, but I am much less bright. Your accuracy has earned you a reward. Let me kiss your scarf. My hand, please. What is it? Is there a poem about hands in your memory too? What kind of a life would I have if this hand were to reach out to me like this every night? Come for me every night around 9:00 p.m. And let you go to the ball? Take me to the ball tonight. In boots, in this dress? Those who are with me are above etiquette. All right, then. Let's go. No. We have time. Talk to me. Tell me about your life. Tell me what everyone else knows that I don't. Nobody knows anything. Tell me of the days when you came closest to the mission of men, to discovery, to victory, to death… And the ball? The ball will come next. Dancing with your secrets… What a treat for your friend. Bravo for the parade, but it lacks announcements. You'll get it. Ladies and gentlemen, the battle between the lovely Duchess de Langeais and the famous General de Montriveau continues unabated. Where are they? Where are they, ladies and gentlemen? The General believes he is close to success but… But he is very far from it. She allowed him to give her a glass sphinx that belonged to Cleopatra. Xavier, what are you doing? He’s full of joy today, because she has allowed him to call her Antoinette. And she calls him Armand. Xavier! Are you being naughty? Come closer, ladies and gentlemen. Who wants to have their heart torn apart? Those who doesn't sleep all night, blow out the day? We'll give you the address. Who wants to be torn to pieces? Who wants to have his heart broken? Who wants to die in torments? How much is it? Adèle? Some hyacinth milk. Thank you. A few drops are enough. Thank you. Why don't you trust me? But I only trust you, my dear. Everyone knows your secret, and you won't tell me. It's probably because I don't know it either. What is this secret the whole world knows? That you love Mr. de Montriveau. I love Montriveau? Well, I was right. I didn't know that secret. Don't joke. You love him. My little Caroline, at the time of my marriage my heart learned a lesson. It was wounded and Incapable of loving any more. But he loves you, no doubt about that. That’s his problem. But if you don’t tell him that you won’t love him, how will it all end? Very well, my dear. Shall I tell you how it will all end? I shall have the whole Montriveau for some time, at the ball, hunt, theater. He will tell me he loves me. I will tell him I like him and he will be appointed ambassador to Turkey, yes. Unless he goes to Oceania and sends me wonderful letters from there. And we will forget each other. And we'll meet again later with his wife who will be the daughter of a Rajah or a Peruvian billionaire. When will you be my wife? Your wife? Today, if I could. Alas, I am already married. When will you be mine? Is it my happiness you want, or your pleasure? I’ll happily wait for you every evening, to be seen on your arm, to hear your words. Is it really necessary for our agreement to become a liaison and a source of compromise, and humiliation? Wait. Tell me your condition for waiting, I will accept it. My condition? That you repeat what you just said using “you” instead of “us”. I am happy in the happiness you give me. Would I be happy in your pleasure? You adorn my life, you are one of its treasures. Do you want to bring me that, what we find repugnant, in all these relationships of the couples that surround us, the compromises, the humiliations? No! Wait again. Tell me your condition for waiting again, I will accept it. That you kiss me. A very masculine condition: to buy virtue with a kiss. What, on the forehead? Is it my fault that what I like best about you is written on your forehead? Her lips? No, ladies and gentlemen. Her body? No, ladies and gentlemen. Nor the promise of his surrender. That is not precisely what the General Marquis de Montriveau got. He got a kiss on the forehead. Which he could not save until the end. And that's it for three weeks. She is pretty, right? -Who is? -Jacquette de Rochefide. Don't her shoulders droop a little? You must know that. You can’t take your eyes off her. I am looking ahead, dear Caroline. Yes, and I am at your side. -Come, come. -Yes. Antoinette de Langeais or coquetry. Or coldness. You are mistaken. She's much more than that. A coquette that gets tired. A cold woman, that gets warm. No. She is, without knowing it, a woman who likes to avenge women. -The Proud one. -You say? Montriveau or the proud one. Is it pride to wait four months for the good pleasure of the Duchess? No! But you, you don't like men. Where did that come from? I adore them all. That's what I said. You see them all together, you don't see anyone. But I see you very well, Marsay, and I adore you. -Do you see me all alone? -Yes, I do. When you're with me, it's not as if you’re with the others? But not at all. I am with the spirit of Marsay, with the pretty chin of Marsay. The Duchess de Langeais sees me, sees me and my chin. My friends, what a pity to learn this too late. But why too late? I beg your pardon. Do you love me, yes or no? No! Don't move. Don't answer me. I only want to tell you what I tell you every night when I'm alone. The suspicions I dare not imagine in front of you. Do you love me or not? Perhaps you’ve never asked yourself this question. Perhaps the only question for you is to exercise your power over men. The Grisettes of the Palais-Royal have more heart and innocence than you. Antoinette, what torment for a lover, whose life is yours, to wonder every minute if you’re the most divine woman or the most hypocritical. Do you know it yourself? In any case, I'm dying. I'm sorry. What divine music, my friend. Hello, Caroline. You have a minute, don't you? All the time. It's nice to be your age and have all the time in the world. I'll have it all my life. It's beautiful, that scarf. Don't you think so? It's beautiful. You're beautiful too. It suits you perfectly. I'll give it to you. No, thank you. Why not? Don't you like it? Yes, but I'll never wear a scarf again. I've come to say goodbye. “Goodbye”? I'm entering a convent. Adèle! And your fiancé? He is getting married in a month to another woman. My poor girl, you who loved him so much. I still love him. I love him much more. I will love him above love. -But where are you going? -To Majorca, to the Carmelites. One of our ancestors founded the order. The women of our family are received there on their names. My dear, but you're not going to bury yourself for a man? We don't bury ourselves in the sky. Be happy, Antoinette. I will be happy. I will never love. Pamiers, my dear Pamiers. My dear niece! What joy after six months. Come with me! Yes, yes, come with me to the Neuilly gate. I’ll have time to tell you all the news from Paris. But I already know them. A boat with a boiling pot has been seen on the Seine and there is intrigue between the Duchess of Langeais and General de Montriveau. Is that who you're joining? That's him. Are you riding alone with him? In the past, there was a swarm of gentlemen around you. My gunner scares them, I think. Doesn't he scare you? Yes, he scares me. And he reassures me against everything that is not him. Everything he is, is contradictory, and all that inspires me. Of all the men, he’s the one who knows the most about life, the universe. And he is the only one who makes me feel like a child. That's because he loves you more than we usually do. Pamiers, what shall I do with him? I’m not asking him not to love me, I’m asking for the benefits of love, without the burden. You won't get off so easily with Montriveau. So far, I am getting away with it. Not for long. If you love him, he will simply destroy your life, your peace and your reputation in the world. Who says I love him? And if you don't love him, he'll destroy you in revenge, because you were reckless, my dear. Believe me, if there is still time, dismiss him. I think you’re right. I don’t sleep well. Women are jealous of me, they spy on me, my friends go away. Yes, nothing grows in the shadow of love. Is that him over there? That's him! Look at him, Pamiers. There's nothing scary about him. He is… He looks tame, it seems. He looks like someone who was never seen in Paris. And rarely on this earth. He looks happy. If that’s what frightens you, I assure you that in a quarter of an hour he won't. Our horses are not satisfied. What's wrong with them? They are used to listening. And you haven't said a word. I don’t feel like talking today. Thank you. Did last night make you tired? No. I found it pleasant. These people are driven by vice, vanity and habit. These people are very nice. That wind that blew all night? I love the wind. I can't think of anyone but myself as the cause of such a nuisance. Me neither. What an honor to have this place in your heart! In my feelings, yes. In short, I displease you. But you have neither to please, nor to displease me. You have to be a friend. “A friend”? My friend. Your friend? One of your hundred, one of your thousand friends! No, no, there will be someone in this world who will not be content to be your friend! Very well, very well, let him not be. Antoinette! Am I dreaming? Have I misheard you every night of this month? What have I told you? There is not one of your words, one of your gestures, that seemed to say to me, “You offer me everything, I accept everything.” I knew that you could only be had as a whole. I didn't ask for the details. So you aren’t a woman who loves? -The Grisettes of the Palais-Royal… -You are repeating yourself, dear. Oh, don't go on. You are forgetting my husband. If that's what's stopping you, I'll take care of your husband. What do you mean? If you love me, I'll take care of your husband. I know fate and its ways. They obey me. And if I don't love you? Then I'll take care of myself. Answer me, openly, for once. Do you love me or not? When I know, I'll tell you. Farewell. I'll be at your house tonight at five o'clock. Oh, I won't be there. Farewell. I am no longer there for General de Montriveau, Suzette. Alright, Duchess. The duke is in the lounge, Madam. -My father? -No. Mr. Duke de Langeais. He's been waiting for nearly an hour. Hello, Antoinette. Hello. I'm glad you recognize me after three years. I thought I had forgotten you. But at first sight, I found you in your entirety. It seems to me that you left me yesterday. I can see it on your face. It is the same as the day I left. It is the face you made for me. So there is at least one man in Paris for whom the Duchess de Langeais is not smiling. There is one. There is one who turned a young girl into an old woman in a month. I'm not here to be criticized. Then don't stay. My whole being is a living criticism against you. What do you want? To sit down first, if I may. And stay. Stay where? In this house that is mine, near this woman that is mine. You're joking, right? You should know that this woman belongs to no one. Precisely, I have come to help her against a possible conqueror, whose existence I was the last to know, but whose name all Paris repeats. Paris has the right to be wrong. Not you, who knows the reality. What reality? Paris thinks I am frivolous, easy. You know that your hardness has dried up forever the heart that was offered to you. Nothing can be watered and irrigated like the heart. The smallest confession or the smallest tear of autumn is enough. Loving the duke de Langeais, after three years of games, parties and orgies, returns to Paris to prevent his wife from loving. No, it is not this concern that brings you here. You are jealous of the only good thing I have left in the world. It's him you've come to take away. -You won't have it. -What property? My freedom. When has a woman ever claimed her freedom, if only to make herself a slave? Your freedom, but you'll have it all. We will live as we lived during the years of exile. Each of us had our own life. I endured everything for our cause. I don't have to anymore. Believe me, your absence will do more for the honor of the Langeais than your presence. I'm moving in tonight. Very well, then. Then I'm leaving. -Are you leaving this house? -If you enter it, yes. -It will be a scandal. -I don't care. After so much suffering and tears, I've managed to make a life for myself with no future, no passion, no tenderness, but a quiet life. I don't have the strength to love, but above all, I don't feel the strength to hate. If you stay, my decision is to leave. -What are you doing? -I'm ringing Suzette. -She will prepare my trunks. -Where will you go? Wherever I feel invited. My father's, a friend's, the convent. Did Madame call me? No, Suzette. No, it's me. My carriage is back. Let her out again. Goodbye, Antoinette. It is really curious how the voices of freedom and love are confused in a woman. Perhaps you have to know them, otherwise you couldn't distinguish them. Of the two of us and against our habit, it is you who have lied today. General de Montriveau is here. He asked if Madame could see him this evening. But let him come at once, Suzette, at once! And now, Armand, leave me for a minute. Leaving you alone at this hour, in the middle of the Palais-Royal? Just a minute, you'll do me a favor. To leave you among those grisettes and calicos? It's horror. It's them I want to see. Only the grisettes know how to love. They are simple, only they are generous. I want to take a lesson in love from them. But who inspired this madness? You did. Forgive me, but I was a fool. Antoinette de Langeais asking advice from the grisettes? But that's like Jesus asking the Samaritan woman for directions. That's what he did. Just a minute! It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Very nice, it's true, Madam. But what have you done? Why so late? -But I… -You're five minutes late. Do you want me to die? You are five minutes late, Armand. Do you want me to die? Is the General at home? Are you in a hurry? Are you going to your courtesan? I'm going to the Duchess. That's what I meant, to your courtesan with a crown. Poor Ronquerolles! Oh, I don't attack her virtue. She knows how to defend herself. She's a courtesan in spirit. What session are you at now? What do you mean? How is she stopping you at this moment? The first month, generally speaking, it was her situation in the world. The second month, her husband. The third, God and Father Gondran. I'm in the fourth. You are at the interlude, the naivety, the romance. Each of us had our musical bonus in the fourth month. Hasn't she sung anything to you yet? -No, she hasn't. -What's the most fashionable romance? “The Tagus River.” I'd be very surprised if she didn't offer you one of these nights. “The Tagus River.” It would bring you back to feelings if you wanted them. You are a cynic. And you, a fool. You want her, your Duchess, I think. -And I shall have her. -You shall not have her. You've had kisses, the evening wash, the towels. -I've had oaths. -“Oaths”? Well, go up to her house, ask oaths of her, ask for what you want, ask for it like a man, and you'll see what you get. You'll get “The Tagus River”. Farewell! Antoinette, let's go. To the ball? It's a bit late. No, away from the ball. Let's go where the sun is waiting for us, Italy, Spain. Portugal? Portugal, if you like, but far from the gossip, the defamation, the prejudice. But it was in Paris that our love was born. I love Paris. Because it protects you against me. But why always wait? You yourself repeat it. There is nothing more that separates us. What is this secret? But it is very simple. What is it? It's the secret of all women: Will I always be loved? Do you doubt it? Women grow old, I will too. That is our baggage. But a woman who has known the most marvelous happiness and who wakes up to nothingness, that is what I never want to be. Do you want me to swear I'll kill myself if I leave you? Days of tenderness Like a beautiful dream have fled Heavy sadness Of sorrow and boredom Now from my life Far from my sweet friend Will forever Alas, wither the course What are you singing there? A Portuguese tune. The tune that all simple hearts are singing in Paris at this moment. Haven't you heard it? Not yet. Perhaps it's because I don't know any simple hearts. What is it called? River Tagus I follow your banks But you hurt me! I don't want you to sing that tune. No one has ever had the chance to say “I don't want” to me. Tagus River I follow your banks I forbid you to sing this tune! -Are you mad? -No, I'm not. I am a husband who has come to claim what he was promised. That's in poor taste, even from the dearest of husbands, and that you are not. In any case, I will be your lover. Let me. Who are you? If I were a woman, I’d love you. You would enter my home, I would melt with joy. So many times, in the middle of a ball, I have wished to press you against me to kill you, in front of everyone! At last I am doing it! You will have wanted it. Have the goodness to come back when I am visible. I have no time to wait! Napoleon's soldiers, it seems, confuse women and cities. When I seriously want what I asked you just now, I will have it. -Will you have it? -I shall have it! I’ll be pleased once you want it. For the sake of curiosity, I shall be delighted to see how you'll do it. I am delighted that the both of us will have that opportunity. Will you allow me to pick you up for the ball tomorrow? No. I've already made a promise. Have you finished playing that silly tune? Everybody likes that silly tune. I don't like it! I have to finish the roll to get another one. So, stop your organ and get out. Sorry! The municipal and civil regulations allow me to play all the pieces in my box and in all places, sir! Here you are. Here's ten francs, disappear! River Tagus I follow your happy banks To your shore I bid you farewell River Tagus Will you let her sing? What's wrong with that one? He hates “The Tagus River” and all the women who sing it! What do you care? What if I like Mathilde to sing “The Tagus River” to me? If you like to be fooled and lied to that's your business! Arthur, I'm going to have a nervous breakdown! He's a bourgeois who wants to gag his wife. What about freedom, Mr. Ultra? His wife makes him a cuckold by singing it. I know him! He's a maniac. He can't stand “The Tagus River”! Tagus River I follow your happy banks Armand, you spoke to me of freedom of the countryside. Will you take me there? My carriage will be waiting for you tomorrow morning. Antoinette. He is dead, Mr. Marquis. Did you hear the news? -Napoleon is dead. -Yes, they say so. Born on an island, died on an island. But he touched Europe in the meantime. Once he spoke to me. I had just shot a Cossack. “What is your name?” he said. “Bompied,” I said. “Bompied, Jules.” “You really don't make the proverbs lie,” he said. “Good foot, good eye.” -Here are some memories! -Are you taking your letter back? I am. I lost my mind. It's for the General on behalf of the Duchess of Langeais. It was he who gave you the cross, right, general? Yes, Bompied, it was him. -Once he spoke to me, General. -You've already told me that, Bompied. Here! Mr. de Ronquerolles didn't come? He waited for you for an hour, General. A courier also came from the Duchess of Langeais. Armand, you've convinced me and I love you. Tonight, at 8:00 p.m. a carriage will be waiting at the Trône gate. Antoinette. Hush! Yes, you are right. Before we are reunited forever, let's each of us gather all our weight of tenderness, devotion, love. I knew you were like that. That courage in the face of passion. I knew you weren't the flirt they all think you are. But speak. But speak, I beg you. -But who are you? -Let go of me, I'm Paméla. -Paméla? -Paméla Blanchot. -You're hurting me! -Who are you? Were you paid for this show? -Yes, they paid me. -Who did? Someone very good. I had to obey. You're scaring me! You, you have nothing to fear. Looking for someone, Antoinette? Yes. I was just looking if Montriveau was here. He was supposed to come, but you know, Montriveau is moody. He's punctual. He may be in a bad mood, as he often is. In any case, my dear, the General is reported absent. I am taking you away. And your golden-eyed daughter, Marsay? Dear madam, I'm going to tell you the most extraordinary story that ever happened to a man. How fortunate for me, who would never have any. One night in Havana, the most handsome man in Europe met the prettiest woman in America. What's the matter with you? Am I waltzing too fast? Marsay, please excuse me. I've been waiting for you, Armand. The king has detained you? If it wasn't him, I blame you. Or perhaps you don't like carriage rides? I do. Why would you want to deprive me of it? Would you allow me to invite Madame de Langeais, General? You can't dance in boots. Armand, has something happened to you? What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that? Because I'm seeing you for the first time. Armand, you are ill! “Ill”? Thank God, I am cured, and of the worst leprosy. But, come on, it's me, it's Antoinette who's talking to you. There never was an Antoinette! There has never been a Duchess of Langeais, nor of beauty, nor of nobility. There has only ever been one girl. There has only ever been one Paméla! But you are suffering, Armand. Tell me why you are suffering. I may be a poor remedy, but I'm here. Beware. I'm ready for anything. Oh, Armand, if your love… My love? That's the word you shouldn't have used. Your lips are made for blasphemy, as well as for lies. My love, I can speak of it. It was not my love. It was love itself. I loved as a child loves with rapture or tears, as a man loves with exaltation and despair. My pride was the one I loved, my career, my work, the one I loved, she was every hour of my day and I believed that it was the supreme happiness that penetrated my most secret veins. It was the poison, the infection! Enough! Finally, what have I done? -What am I to blame for? -What have you done? -Sorry, excuse me. -No, stay, stay. That's not too much for me. This woman’s asking what she did. Perhaps you'd have the opportunity to talk face to face. I intend to tell her in front of a witness! If she doesn't know remorse, she will know shame! She will leave branded forever! It is your fever that has taken hold of you. Come on. What has she done? What she has done every day and without respite since she became a woman! -Antoinette. -No! Let him speak. Montriveau! This woman is a monster among women! She has a taste for crime. Her joy is to kill the joy of living in her victims! As soon as she sees a man worthy of his name, she can’t let him be happy and free! She lures him by the vilest trick, in a game that is not even new to everyone until he’s disgusted with life and with himself. I beg you to be quiet. You are mad! You have no rights over Madame de Langeais. Yes, Marsay, he has. Let him speak. My rights over her? But you have them all. I pledged my life to her one night. And I had the right to light the wick of her lamp. I dedicated my ambitions, my works to her and I had the right to see her bare foot. Like you, no doubt. She understood that I was ready to kill myself for her. And I had the right to hear “The Tagus River”! And as I threatened to leave her forever, I was allowed to hold a vile doll in my arms! -You are possessed. -You are delirious. -Think of where you are. -Where I am! Yes. Yes, you are right. I'll be silent, I am in the world. I'm in this field where everyone is just like her. It is in the street and in front of the market women that I should have torn off her mask! Here, you are all on her side! Come, all of you. No, no, let them stay. I want my witnesses too. Armand, at one point, at least, you are like other men. You only hear what is shouted. When you say that I played with you, you may be right. But I have sung for others and I have enjoyed the homages, but where was the harm? It is also true that my heart was empty. Tonight is my chance to prove what a real woman is in the face of real love. Refusing it, I would be unworthy. Listen to her. She will tell you that she loves me, that a veil has just fallen from her eyes and that she loves me. Armand, why do you take away the joy of telling it to me personally? You know now, my friends, how this proud Duchess of Langeais responds to insults. It is up to you to take advantage of it. For me, it's too late! Armand! One last word. You see, these people do not laugh, they do not mock. No. They understand better than you. They understand that, when I walk out of here later, if not on your arm, I'll break out of this world. I don't blame you. We are both above scandal. I see your pain, not your anger. But think that from this moment on, it is I who’ll wait and suffer. If you want more proof of my sincerity, you will have it all. And in front of all of them let’s arrange to meet. I’ll wait for you always, Armand, every hour. You will find me whenever you want. I will not go out again. Except to meet you where you have told me to come. I'll run there. So, to the Neuilly gate! Paméla! Marsay? Your arm. The comedy is over, Léontine. Yes. The drama begins. Antoinette, in love, I would have seen that before I died. You would have preferred to see Antoinette happy. You are angry with me. Underneath your most frivolous life, you always seemed destined for duty. Love is still the most beautiful mission that God has entrusted to men. It is hard. -You haven't seen him for ten days? -No. He's invisible. Invisible everywhere I had been seeing his image every day, every hour, at the ball, at the theater, at my door. Even at the gates of his barracks, I went there. He was erased for me from the world. Did you write to him? Every day. Never got an answer. My letters don't even come back to me. There is a corner of nothingness in Paris where they fall to the waste. Your poor letters, you speak of the purest gold. How humble you are. Not enough. Not enough to convince him yet, but I will be more than that. What do you have in mind? The way to bring him back here, to prove to him that my love is above all vanity, all prejudices. I have found him, Pamiers. Tomorrow he will be here. You will help me, Pamiers. You will not leave me. As you wish, Antoinette. One doesn't have that many opportunities at 80 to be the page of love. Tell me, isn't that the carriage of the Duchess of Langeais? It is, sir. Hey, Manerville! -What's that? -That's the Duchess's carriage. This time it is. She's at Montriveau's. Hey! Maturaire! Strange story, Princess. Mere gossip. We saw the carriage ourselves and it's still there. All you had to do was not see it. -I hate scandals. -And I don't like it. But for a young woman to proclaim her love so courageously, that's a scandal that moves my heart and I want to do everything to save it. The whole Paris is on the lookout. What are we going to do? Go up to Montriveau's by a hidden staircase and come back down by the main door with Antoinette? Is that your opinion, Pamiers? No. Then we are in an impossible situation and Paris will celebrate. -You can't think of any remedy? -No. Why not? Why is the answer always no? Because I know the Duchess better than you. Because I guessed that she didn't go out this morning. -My dear girl! -My dear niece! My dearest! But what's the matter with you? You didn't go out, my dear? All Paris thinks you spend your days at Montriveau's. -Of course not, auntie. -I know you. But I wanted all of Paris to believe that I was at Mr. de Montriveau's. My child! And the result, as you know, my dear child, is the honor of the family. Good God! Leave the family honor alone for a minute! Speak seriously. You have compromised your husband and your reputation, but everything can still be mended. I don't want to repair anything. My girl, you will lose us and your family! My family has sacrificed me to their interests. They may blame me for seeking amends. You will lose not only your position, but your fortune too. I am at a point where interests can no longer stand against feelings. My carriage will go to Mr. de Montriveau tomorrow until he is touched by my persistence and brings it back here himself. You are crazy, girl. You disgrace us. You're bothering us with your disgrace and your madness! Go away, all three of you. Leave us alone. My jewel, believe me when I tell you that I love you and admire you for knowing how to love. This scandal will do you no good. Who will do me good? Only you. I come from a century when people knew how to love. It is your person that will seduce the General, he knows it. -That's why he's avoiding you. -I want to see him. I want to reach him, even at the end of the world. Then this will not take you so far, but it will be enough. It is the key to Montriveau's flat. My good man unfortunately got it for me this morning from the General's servant. Make it the key to your happiness. Be happy, dear. Armand? Armand, are you there? Don't hurry, Armand. I'm waiting for you. I have a whole life to wait for you. I'm waiting for you in your chair. I'm waiting for you at your desk. I won't move from here. If winter passes and if winter comes again, here is the fireplace. I will wait for you there. Madame should rest, she is not well. No. No. I'm not very well. Don't let her worry too much. This is the General's 15th duel. He's always done it very well. Is the General fighting? But yes, at this very moment, at the Champ-de-Mars, with Mr. de Maulincour, about the carriage that was parked in front of the door. About my carriage? I feel better. I feel much better. Much, much better. It's over, beautiful. You're too late. They're taking him away. -They're taking who away? -The little one with the gun. You'd think the taller one would always have to take the bullet. No, it was the smaller one. Here they are. It's getting richer, your Duchess' picture. The Duchess? There was a Duchess? It's strange, I don’t remember her. Well, here it is. It's a rather short will, but I don't think I've forgotten anything. We'll complete it every ten years, Duchess. Of course. Thank you, Father. You have given me another opportunity to express my gratitude. Shall I come by tomorrow, Wednesday, as usual? We'll let you know, Father. Tomorrow may not be a usual Wednesday. Dear Pamiers, you may be the last friend I will have spoken to. I can therefore ask you for a favor. It’s about going to Mr. de Montriveau with this letter, and making him read it, telling him that my life or death are at stake. If he deigns… If he deigns… If he deigns to read it, you will add this. You'll find him at five o'clock. He's having dinner at home then. I know he is. He must come to me for the answer. If three hours later… Why three hours? Why three, why a thousand, why eternity? Sorry, darling. If three hours later, if at eight o'clock, he has not left his house, all will be clear. The Duchess of Langeais will have disappeared from this world. Antoinette, if I may speak… Silence. Thank you. Come and dine with me, after you have delivered the letter. You'll see, the last dinner of the Duchess de Langeais will be worthy of you and me. Has Madame la Duchesse called? Mr. le Vidame will come to dinner with me, Suzette. In the small dining room? No. In the big one, with all the chandeliers. Well, Duchess. I am obeying the wishes of my niece Antoinette by coming to see you. Do you know this name? Do you remember it? I have heard it. My niece has asked me to give you this letter. It is the last she will write to you. I cannot consider my mission complete until I can tell her that you have read it. I owe you this appeasement. My friend, I have taken back my letters. I'm burning them. They did not deserve it. For the last time, I have come to beg you to stop this cruel game. If, three hours after this letter is delivered to you, you are not my husband forever, I will have disappeared from this earth. Antoinette. It is read. No, no, thank you. And the theater, dear friend, how is the theater in Paris? Antoinette! I have been distracted for two months from theater, from music and painting. I feel almost guilty about it. It is a woman's duty to know all the talents, the geniuses that emerge. Perhaps one has arisen since the winter and is unknown to me. -This is very bad. -You have time. Who knows? Come on, Pamiers, let the names of all these young people, who will later be our glory, come to me for their first and, perhaps, their last visit. Who are they talking about, in Paris? They are talking about a young poet. Mr. Alphonse de Lamartine. What a beautiful name! It's beautiful, the name of an unknown poet. What's he talking about, Mr. de Lamartine? Well, he's an elegiac of the willows, of the lakes… Dear Pamiers, you don't dare tell me he's talking about love. It's as if he were talking about me, isn't it? Pamiers, your precautions are futile. The word “lake” or the word “willow” goes through my heart as hard as the word “love”. Do you know any verses by Mr. de Lamartine? Can you quote me a single one? Alas! My memory has become a sieve and this Mr. de Lamartine is pure water. What a pity. In painting, we talk a lot about… Hush! Can't you hear footsteps in the street? I am eighty years old, dear friend. You need real noise to reach my ear. Or a real stroller. This one isn't. And in painting? My dear girl, but you're not eating. And in painting? A young fool named Delacroix. Delacroix? They have beautiful names this year. Would you have me disappear without hearing those beautiful new names? Listen. No. What about music? What's the last name of a musician I'll ever hear? It's a young pianist. A prodigy doing variations of “The Tagus River”. It is a little boy named Chopin. Life and success to the little boy named Chopin! It's 7:00 p.m. already. I'll have to get dressed. Please ask the concierge if he's home. Yes. What time is it? It's 7.40 p.m. Goodbye, Pamiers. What about the passers-by? I don't see who could disrespect me. Today is Mardi Gras, the day of masks! Tonight, I’m indifferent about the masks and the faces. Come on, Pamiers! My umbrella is large, beautiful lady. Thank you, sir. Rain is wet, my beautiful child. And if you don't know it, I'll teach you. Thank you! Do you have the time, sir? It's nearly 8:00 p.m. He has no heart, the one who makes such a nice person wait in the rain. He will come. He's coming. It is 8:00 p.m. He won't come. Yes, he will. From the bey of Algiers, we'll go to the legitimist of Spain. It is complicated in a different way. The solution… I don't have it yet. But you have to give it to the King tomorrow. But I will have it tomorrow! You will have nothing at all, if you are as distracted at night as you are this afternoon and as devoid of inspiration as you have been for the past fortnight. There is a leak in your genius, my friend. Anyway, for tonight, let's stop working. It's almost 8:00 p.m. What time, you say? It's 7:50 p.m. What's the matter? Are you late? No, I'm not late, of course. Sick, then? Am I in your way? I'm leaving. I'll have dinner with Ferragus. On the contrary, Ronquerolles, stay with me. Stay with me, at least until 8:00 p.m. After that, the danger will be over. You could leave then. You're running a risk before 8:00 p.m.? A great peril. Which this letter threatens me with. I'll stay, then. Why don't you go into the dressing room, Miss? No. No. It's hardly raining, thank you. I know you well. I saw you with the General. Yes, I was seen with the General. He's a hard man, the General, Miss. -Beware. -No. No. I think he's very gentle. He changes. When Napoleon died, he didn't cry. He's a changing man. No. I think he's very faithful. What does your clock say? It's 8:00 p.m. Is it behind? No. It's slow. Oh, dear! Miss! Your coat! Saved! Why saved? Your threatening letter is no longer valid after 8:00 p.m.? You can read it. Come on, hurry up, run. Run where? Run to Antoinette and hurry. To my crowned courtesan, as you yourself call her! I said some stupid things, and I did them too. Let's hope the last one can be fixed. -Go, you idiot. -No, I won't. I'd despise myself too much if I gave in. Unfortunately, I know her, Ronquerolles. Not as well as I have known her for the past two weeks. Make up your mind. It will be too late. There's one thing you don't know, Ronquerolles. She's committed a crime. I won't go! You're so stubborn. You're forcing me to do it, that's much the worse for me. It's the story of the Neuilly gate, that crime, isn't it? Did she tell you? It's definitely hers! The real criminal will confess in two sentences, because the time is short. I thought your passion would ruin your career and our plans. I was wrong. I thought the Duchess was a fool and a flirt. I couldn't be more wrong. I am a specialist in the smallness of the soul, but I can also distinguish noble souls. The Duchess is worthy of you. And since that day, I had remorse. Since which day? The day when I have confused you. It was I who sent you to the Neuilly gate. Here is the real letter. I did it out of friendship for you. Please, forgive me. Where is Madame de Langeais? Isn't she at your place? But why at my place? I left her at your door. She waited for you until 8:00 p.m., as her letter said. -But what time did you get off? -Just now. Then the greatest misfortune is to be feared. Hurry up. Antoinette? Didn't you see a lady waiting here? A poor lady, yes, General. She refused to enter my room. She was all wet. And how long ago did she leave? At 8:00 p.m., by my clock. “Is your clock behind?” she said. “No,” I said. “It's slow.” Then she said, “Oh, my God!” Oh, my God! She left her coat here. Here, take it. The police are pointing to two drowned young women. -She didn't kill herself! -But what do you know? I'll find her by her voice one day. I will hear her voice and she will be there. The dead do not speak. But you can't hear them. She lives! It is, however, as if she had crossed a border. One would have thought that there would be memories, traces of the Queen of Paris. Nothing. Everything about her has disappeared. Just a coat. A coat that was already cold. -Ronquerolles, any news? -Tracks. Nine tracks. There is hardly a town from which the arrival of a solitary and mysterious young woman is not reported. That so many beautiful women should evaporate from the world in this way, I would never have believed. The ugly ones, in any case, all remain. “In Provins, in a boarding house, a young teacher.” “Near Montargis, on a farm, disguised as a peasant girl.” “At Moulinet, in the forest of Compiègne, alone, in a hunting lodge.” For five months, how many countries have I traveled through, how many vain searches. In Italy, in Holland, a melancholic girl quickly consoled. In Switzerland, a young girl, who discovered she was a poet. In Hungary, a ravishing madwoman, among the ruins. In Spain, this convent, it already has its victim of love. Caroline, Antoinette's cousin. Antoinette. They think you are her relative. The Superior only knows Spanish. Don't give yourself away. Antoinette? My name is Sister Thérèse. Antoinette, finally! Five months I've been looking for you, day and night. God hides his own well. But you are not this, you belong to me! Do I look like it? I can't see your face, but your voice told me yesterday. Antoinette, you still love me. You told me so by the sacred hymns themselves! Antoinette, you have not yet taken your vows. The Duke is dead. I am coming to take you. Nothing can be taken from God. But you love me! I love you. I love you as I have never loved you, more and more every day. Then you will follow me. No. No. I will never again go away from the world where love gives only serenity and happiness. But that is not true. You are longing, burning! I am happy. -Show me your face and I will believe you! -Armand! “Armand”? You called him Armand? You know this man? Yes, Mother. Let's go. This is my brother. Good. I'll leave you. You're lying for me. You just told her I'm your brother. But you won't convince God with that lie. He knows you love me. He doesn't want to keep you in that prison. On which side of this gate is the prison? On the side where you are shaking, where your day of sorrow follows your night of illusions, or on mine, which gives onto eternal life? But the life of men must first be human. Antoinette, be human for a minute, and you will understand. For fifteen days I have been this human being of whom you speak. Fifteen days I have lived to see a human being, to hear a human being, to touch a human being. It's a terrible ordeal. I'm sorry. He was in the same city, two steps away from me, and I couldn't reach him. That's why I gave up on his human presence. But when you know the truth, you will forgive me. It was neither you nor me who did it. The one I love can now live a thousand miles away from me. He will no longer leave me. I no longer have to reach out to touch him. He is inside me. I no longer have to open my eyes to see him. I only have to close them. He embellishes each hour of my solitude. He lives in each of my prayers. You have turned our love into a litany, that's horrible. But don't stay like that, motionless. You have never been so far from me. Come closer. Come closer to the gate, if only by a millimeter. Thank you. You made the first move. Everything will be easy now. No. No, go away. I'm not the one you're looking for anymore. You wouldn't even recognize me if you saw my face. But I can see it under your veil, Antoinette. It is that of my love. Are you sure of that? Look what it has become in the eternal calm. Eternity is eating you up, Antoinette. You are dying! But your face says only one thing: the one you love is me. Shut up. Do not shorten these minutes. These are our last minutes. You love me, you will follow me, I swear to your God. Blasphemy! I will take you, my dearest love, I will heal you. I beg you, choose life. But I don't have the strength, you see. Then it is you who will have wanted it. I will kill myself! Mother! This man is my lover. Everything is ready: the car, the boat, the ship, the sea. All we need now is the heroine. Is this your first kidnapping? It's the twelfth. But the first one that gives me anguish and yet it is not for my own sake. I fear it is not on behalf of any person here below, even Montriveau. Is she getting worse? She has not left her cell for three days. Yet this evening she asked to get up, said the woman who informs me. I doubt it was to come to us. She comes back. It's 8:00 p.m. He has read my letter. He will come at 8:00 p.m. She is delirious. Antoinette. Don't talk. The pulse is barely there. The slightest emotion could kill her. He will come, won't he, Pamiers? -He will surely come. -He will. I'll stay here. He might not see me. It's raining. It's the first time it's rained on me. It's sweet, the rain, on my tears. I cried, Pamiers. I cried. He loves me, doesn't he? Surely, dear girl. He loves me more than anything in the world. More than anything else in the world. Yes. Yes. If he didn't love me, he wouldn't have found a way to fly over the seas and skies to bring me my coat. He saw me without a coat in the rain. He came by two minutes early to throw it over my shoulders. How well I look in my coat. He can't be far now, can he, Pamiers? Certainly. He can't be far away since his hands are already there, since they touch me, since they press me. It is you. -It's you! -Yes, it's me, my love. Tell me you love me. Aren't you afraid? Telling you that was my whole mission in this world. Aren't you afraid that when I say it, I won't know what to do with it? No. You will have to love me. You will be loved. From where I'm going to, you'll be loved more than we love here. No. No, don't put that sorrow on your face. I want to say to someone strong that I love him. To someone happy. You are happy, aren't you? Are you happy? Yes, my darling. I love you. I love you. Excuse me, but I have to take this novice back to the convent. Her novitiate on earth is coming to an end, Father. One more reason. One leaves the earth better on the hallowed ground. There's no hope? Look at this. Is that a lighthouse? It's the lantern of the dead. It's the lighthouse of souls that appear. Poor sweet Duchess. This is what love has brought to this charming little soul: a marriage with death. Be silent. Let's not complain for once that the bride is too beautiful.
