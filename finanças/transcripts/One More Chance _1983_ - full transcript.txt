Bet you he's more than five feet tall by now. Well, you'll see him today. Yeah. Hey, George. I want you to have this. You can use it. No, come on, man. I mean, it's yours. Come on, please. Don't start in. Take it, will you? Come on. Take it, huh? Come on. Huh? (CHUCKLES) Hey, it'll remind you of me, huh? No kidding. (LAUGHING) Well, I gotta take off. I guess this is so long, huh? Take care, man. You're a good man, Bales, you know that? I'll always remember the time we spent here together. Yeah, so will I. Hey, I'll come and visit you. Don't come back. (GATE OPENS) Take care.

What did you do before you got busted? I was a roofer. Installations, things like that. Roofing's good, it's a good job, but right now it's the rainy season. Yeah, sure. I know. What about the rehab program? What did they have you doing? They said you were a good worker in the jacket here. I was doing carpentry. Those assholes. Don't they know what's going on outside? Bales, there's a real world out here with ridiculous mortgages. Builders aren't even building. Half the union's outta work. And they are teaching cons carpentry. I don't mind the job. Maybe you could get something where you worked before. After 14 years? Hey, come on, huh? What, are you kidding me? (SIGHS) Your record's clean, Bales. It's still tough. You are an ex-con. You are pushing 50. Just give it some time. In the meantime, is there anything I can do for you? No. It's all right. I gotta couple of bucks for running money. But... But this suit here... I gotta meet up with my kid, you know. Well... He's gotta see me with the right eyes. How about a new suit? I'd be very grateful. It's not exactly charity. You gotta sign for the loan and you gotta pay it off. If you don't, back to the slammer. It's a $100, you sign right there. And there's something I want you to know. We're here to help. Anytime, day or night, I don't care when it is. All you gotta do is call. Excuse me, miss. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I just wanted to know if a Mrs. Loretta Bales lives in that house over there. Yeah, but I haven't seen her for a couple of days. Well, you see, I'm her husband. And I thought maybe you'd know where she is. No, I really don't know. (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) Don't you think we could have at least asked the guy to stay the night? After all, it is your girlfriend's husband. Maybe the poor guy has nowhere to go. Are you crazy? You want a convicted murderer under our roof? The guy is insane, David. You happen to remember that he killed his brother-in-law? Hey, that was a long, long time ago. So what? He's still a killer. It was during a fight. Those things happen. I don't believe this. He's defending him I'm not defending him. But you're overreacting. Overreacting? You knew she was scared, that's why she had to get out of here. No, I didn't know. And apparently, he doesn't know either. Why didn't you tell him the truth? She kept it a secret. She's afraid of him, David. Well, that's it, man. That's all there is. I simply thought you should know the truth. Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks, anyway. Thanks. Hey, listen. Why don't you stay the night with us? I mean, if you got nowhere else to go, we got plenty of room. No, but thanks. I really gotta go now. All right, take care, huh? Hey, by the way, do you see my kid Robert around. I mean, you see him a lot? Oh, yeah, I see him all over the neighborhood. I bet you he's more than five feet tall by now, huh? Yeah, I suppose. Looks pretty strong too, you know. Is he behaving himself? Oh, yeah. Helps his mother a lot. That's a good kid you got there. I thought so. That's the way I always wanted him to be. GROBER: Initiative. BALES: Yeah. GROBER: You know, I like initiative. You called first thing this morning. It shows initiative. I... Most important thing in life. That's what initiative is. You see all this? Yeah. Started from nothing. Started from scratch. Boy, that's initiative. You know anything about this business at all? No, not really. Never mind. You got initiative. I'll teach you the profession. Thanks, Mr. Grober. You got it? What? Initiative. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. I wanna work and I'm willing to learn. How much you get on your last job? You see, Mr. Grober, I'm an ex-con. I spent the last few years in the stir. Prison. Ooh, you're kidding. I got out just yesterday. But I wanna start work right away. Okay. Never mind. Matter of fact, doesn't make any difference. Soon as I'm finished interviewing the other fellas, we'll call you. Yeah. Sure. Look, you leave your name with the secretary, we'll call you. Hey. Do you see that? What? The guy just came in for the job. I was gonna hire the guy on the spot. So? He's a criminal! Just got out of prison. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Who is it? It's me. Bales. Pete Bales. My husband isn't home. What do you want? I don't need your husband. I gotta talk to you about something. Look, my husband already told you everything we know. Could you open the door, please? I'm very busy. I really don't have the time. Look, it'll only take a minute. I just gotta ask you something. Please. Look, I got something in the oven, so let's make this quick. Listen, I gotta see my kid. I gotta meet up with him. I don't know where to go. I don't know where to start. You're the only one that knows where they are. Look, I told you before, I don't know. Now, I can't talk anymore, I've gotta go. Would you please move your foot? I wanna close the door. Listen, lady, you're not gonna stop me from seeing my kid. I waited too many goddamn years for this. Too many goddamn years of good behavior to get out fast. If you don't leave, I'm gonna call the police. (SIGHS) Listen, lady. Don't scare me by saying you're gonna call the cops. I didn't come here lookin' for trouble. You gotta believe me. Just tell me where they are, and you'll never see me again, all right? All I know is that she said she was going to go see her sister in Phoenix. Phoenix? Where in Phoenix? That's all I know about it. Please. Business slow tonight, huh? Yeah. Well, see you around. Hey. Got a light? You look like you could use some company. How much it gonna cost? Forty bucks. I'm kinda short. We'll work it out. Come on. He attacked me. He could have killed me. I don't understand why they let people like that run around loose. The guy just wants to be with his family. Forget about him being... Forget about the prison thing. He just wants to see the kid. I don't care. I hate that bastard. I'm glad I didn't give him her address. I'm glad I didn't give him her phone number and I never will. Sheila, once you make up your mind, you don't listen to anybody else. David, there are such things as rapes and murders. I mean, they do exist. They happen here every day. You just don't wanna understand. I don't wanna understand? What about you? When was the last time you tried to see my point of view? I don't wanna fight with you. I don't feel like it. You never want to talk about anything. All you wanna do is sit in front of the TV and get drunk. I'm gonna go play a couple games of pool. So then what happened? I didn't get the job, that's what happened. He heard I was an ex-con and then he didn't even wanna talk to me. I was out of a job. And it was your own damn fault then, wasn't it? What are you talking about? Nobody said you had to tell 'em you're an ex-con. He asked me what I did before. What should I tell him? What are you, stupid? Don't you know how to lie? You tell him you just got off the bus from Idaho and you're divorcing your wife and you're looking for a new job. You tell him anything. I did what I did. Why should I lie? You guys think somebody's gonna pin a medal on you for telling the truth. Yeah, well, they ain't. Sure. Sure, there's places maybe it'd do you some good. Only you don't wanna be in those places. Why don't you just forget you ever saw the inside, huh? Fourteen years in the can ain't something you forget that easy. You can save your life story. I've heard it. And why don't you cut the self-pity crap while you're at it? Nobody's interested. Listen, you can't run around saying, "Hi, I just got out of the slammer! "I been there for 14 years. See, I killed this guy." Look, I can't hide what I did forever. I know guys, did lots worse than you. Every place they go, they get treated real nice. You wanna know why? 'Cause they ain't ex-cons anymore. They're lawyers or they're businessmen. They're smart. Put this in the Bennett file. Bales. Good thing you stopped by today. I got something for you. Hold on. Yeah. This just came in today. You're so eager to work. Good job. Pays well. Only thing, I put you on the night shift. I didn't think you'd mind that. Thank you. I don't mind. Thanks a lot. I'll take it. Another thing, Bales. When you get the job and start to work, don't forget... Excuse me. ...don't forget you're still on parole restriction. You gotta report to me here in my office every week. I know. I know. Don't associate with any ex-cons under any circumstances. If you do, back to jail. Believe me, Mr. Carter, I'm not gonna go near them, all right? Better not. If you do, it's back to prison. Now, you gotta inform me of any change of address you have, and you do not leave the state without my permission. And if you go by the rules, I can help you. Yeah. Got a deal? Yeah, sure, Mr. Carter. COOK 1: Hey, you got the order for this? COOK 2: This has been sitting here for a while. COOK 1: We need a hamburger set-up. You see that new hostess we got up front? COOK 3: Where? Where? COOK 1: Whoo! She's got a great ass. COOK 2: Yeah! All right. COOK 4: Kinda old though, huh? COOK 1: Hey, don't forget the tickets. COOK 2: Hey, come on. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hello, Gonzales. Hi, Mike, how are you? Did, uh, you see the new guy I sent you to replace Lopez? Yeah, I saw him. Not too young, I'd say. MIKE: Yeah, well, keep an eye on him. He's an ex-con. He just got out of the can. GONZALES: What you hire that kind of junk for? MIKE: When they come to check the books, it looks good for me. Christ knows I need it right now. Yeah, you need it, but I don't need it and I really don't want it, you know. Hey, listen, Gonzales, I told 'em if he makes any trouble, I'd get rid of the guy, all right? Yeah, okay. Manuel, paprika on this, huh? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Everything okay? Yeah. Good. When you finish here, clean behind the machine over there, right? Yeah, okay. What's your name? Bales. Pete Bales. Right, Bales. Listen, for the next couple of days, if you can, huh, try not to get mixed up with the other guys. They're kinda crazy. They like to pick on new workers like you. What's going on? GONZALES: So, keep your distance, okay? It's the new guy. MANUEL: What new guy? BOB: They hired a guy today. Yeah, okay. COOK: Hey, what's the holdup on that hamburger, huh? MANUEL: Take it easy, man. How you doing, man? Hey, how you doing? You new here? Yeah. My name is Manuel. This is Bob. How you doing? Pete Bales. Nice to meet you. Hey, is it true what I been hearing up there, that you just got out of prison a couple of days ago? Yeah, it's true. Which one was it? San Quentin? No. Tell me something. I hear people say that in prison they like to fuck everyone that comes in. Hey, why don't you guys lay off and get back to work, huh? BOB: Come on, don't hassle the guy. It's his first day. Come on, Gonzales is gonna get pissed off. Well, wait a second. Goddamn! I bet you they laid him when he was a young kid. BOB: Come on, let's go. I understand the young guys, they gotta be queens in order to survive. Hey, what the hell is going on here? (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) MANUEL: Son of a bitch. Who knows how many young kids he raped himself? What'd you say? Hey, come on. Leave him alone, please. I said that if you weren't the queen, you were probably fucking the young kids yourself. (GRUNTS) Lay off! You hit me, you faggot! (GRUNTS) Hey, what the hell is going on? (GRUNTS) (BOTH GRUNTING) BOB: Son of a bitch! MAN 1: Lay off! MAN 2: Come on. BOB: All right. All right. Come on, man. Calm down now. Hold it down. (GROANS) I want you to get out before I call the police, you hear. Get out! MAN: Come on, make the shot, will you please? I'm really horny. Come on. WOMAN: Oh! (CROWD GROANING) BRUNO: Great, he stole the eight ball. (CROWD GROANING) Boo! (CROWD CHEERING) Pay the money. Pay the man! Don't give it to him! Give me that! Twenty bucks. Oh, how quickly I forget. BRUNO: He's broke. What you come here for broke? David, I got a deal for you. I'm gonna put up 25 bucks as a bet with you. Now if I win, you gotta do your famous striptease for my baby. But if I lose, I give you 25 big ones! Hit me again with a J&B, please. (GROANS) What happened to you? Accident. WOMAN: Okay, come on, hit it. (CROWD CHEERING) Fandango! CROWD: (CHANTING) Take it off. Take it off. On the table. Come on. Do it. Take his pants off! His pants off! CROWD: Take 'em off. Off! Come man, off. Hey! Hey! (WHISTLES) WOMAN: Off! Off! What is this, a massage parlor? Take 'em off! Off with the linen and you can quit your grinnin'! (HOOTING AND CHEERING) (LAUGHS) We wanna see what you've got hiding in there. WOMAN: Come on, David, you can do it! Come on, chicken! Come on, take it off. Why don't you go and have a ball? (EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE) Oh! Come on, come on. That's not fair. Come on now, take it off. CROWD: Come on! Take it off. (SHOUTING) All right! Knock it off. That's enough. Hey, what's your problem? Look, just leave him alone, all right? Now get your clothes on, I'm takin' you home. Come on. Who do you think you are, anyway? What's your scene, pizza-face? There is no scene. Then why don't you get the hell outta here? I don't want any problems. You don't want any problems? You don't want any problems? (GRUNTS) (CROWD CLAMORING) MAN: Stop him! (WOMAN SCREAMS) BARTENDER: Somebody call the cops! (GRUNTS) Nah, nah, nah. Cool it. WOMAN: You creep! You, get outta here! (SCREAMS) All right! Don't anybody try it, or I'll jam this right down your throats! Come on, David. Let's get outta here. Don't try it. Don't try it. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Move! Let's get outta here! Here we are. All right. Easy, easy, easy, easy. Okay, all right. Here we go. Just sit right there. I'll be right with you. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Take it easy. He'll be okay. He'll sleep it off and be all right in the morning. I don't know why he does this. We all get crazy once in a while. I don't know what to do about it. Well, I better take off. You want a cup of coffee, Mr. Bales? Sometimes, he'll leave in the night and then he comes back and he's like that. He's drunk as a dog. I don't understand it. (SNIFFLING) Sometimes I sit here the whole night and I don't know if he's... Shit! (SOBBING) Hey. Your husband will be all right. He's the only honest guy I've met since I got out. (CHUCKLING) Yeah, I know. You know, maybe he's got a problem. We all do. You know, his job, pressure. (SNIFFLING) Look what happened to me tonight. I got into a fight on my first day on the job. I get into a fight and I get busted out. What are you gonna do now? Well, I learned one thing in prison. How to think. That's what I'm gonna do. Think about my problems and how to solve 'em. That's what you should do. We fight constantly, and it's just not working. And, uh, I just don't know what to do about it. I'm sure there's something you can do. Hey, you know, I... I come from an Italian family, my mother's side. And with Italian families, family's very important. My mother always used to say. You keep a family together, nothing's gonna hurt 'em. She was right. Well, I think things were a little bit different then. BALES: Nah, that's not true. There's always a lot of problems with our family. My mother had a lot of problems with my father. When I was a kid, I was six years old. My father, he got up one day and took off. Disappeared. I never saw him again. I was six years old. Bastard! I come from a neighborhood in New York, in Brooklyn. There was a lot of refugees. There was this one family next door, very good friend of mine, Myron Goodman, Jewish family. They used to invite me over to their house once in a while on Friday nights, and I'll never forget that. You know why? They were always together. Mother, father, kids, always together. Will never forget that. It's funny how things always repeat themselves. I left my boy without a father. In all those years in prison when I was thinking of him, I always thought of that Jewish family. Always came to my mind. Those Friday night dinners, the candles, the wine. (CHUCKLES) And that chicken soup. Jesus! Chicken soup. Mrs. Goodman. Wow. I missed it a hell of a lot. Everything will be all right. Thanks for the coffee. Mr. Bales? Yeah. Um, I wondered if you could come to dinner Friday night. My mom's from Brooklyn too, and I thought you might enjoy meeting each other. Yeah, I'd like that very much. Thanks a lot. Bye. Of course you admit it was your fault. It was your fault! What did you expect, Bales? Don't you know where you stand? Did you expect them to roll out the red carpet because you're an ex-con? Doesn't work. Okay? All right! I was wrong. Why didn't you think about that before, Bales? How times did I tell you, how many times did I say, that the street's not like prison? Cut the preaching, huh, Mr. Carter. Okay? It'll never happen again. Bales, you don't seem to understand. You may never have the chance to let it happen again! What do you mean, I won't have another chance? What I mean, Bales, is that when you came here, you had a clean record. You don't anymore! This goes on your record as your first bad mark. Now it was hard enough getting you a job in the first place. Now, I really don't know. Oh, I see. So that means you're not gonna try to get me another job. I didn't say I'm not gonna try! I will try! I will try my ass off to get you another job! All I am saying is it's going to be a lot harder. MAN: You know, bad back. (OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS) Bad back. (SNORING) Hi! (LAUGHS) How you doin'? All right. Hey, didn't I meet you, like, two weeks ago? You know, in the mission down on Main Street. No. No. I didn't think so, man, but I thought maybe, you know, because I saw someone that looked like you. I mean, exactly. I mean, all dressed, you know. And it's something you don't see down here every day. Right. (MAN COUGHS) Say, man, why you gotta go cough on my clothes, man? Man, oh, geez! See, you gotta be real careful around here. See, some of these guys, they don't know nothing about hygiene, you see. And whenever they cough, you see, the germs travel in waves. You know what I'm talkin' about? Some of these guys are sick. See, when they cough, the worms just... Germs just travel. Man, look at this. Oh, man. So, you gotta make sure that the germs don't get you. You know what I'm talking about? Say, maybe if you wanna clean your hands, I do have some extra disposable paper towels. Stay away from the bathrooms. Don't be shaking no hands with nobody too much. Thank you. The praying's so long that a body can die of hunger. See what I'm saying? Yeah, sure. Tuesday and Wednesday the food's on Main Street. Thursday it's on Fourth Street. Sunday's you get real sick. Hey, Martin. Hi. Martin's the name. How are you doin'? Bales. Pete Bales. Hi, Pete. Sit down. Jefferson's the name. Jefferson, how are you, Jeff? (WHISTLING) (COUGHS) Hey, man, don't pay no attention to him. He's a hygiene freak. Go ahead, eat. It won't poison you. It's your first time here? Uh, it's just temporarily. I ran out of money, so it's only until I get a job. Things are slow right now. Jeff, sounds like we got ourselves an associate here. Doesn't sound like he likes the smell of sweat any better than we do. Hey, wait a minute. I wanna work. It's just that things are slow. It's kinda tough to get a job. Well, listen, if the man says he wants to work, we got no room for him in our association. I guess we'll have to show you the way to the slave market. Slave market? What's a slave market? The man doesn't know what a slave market is? Well, Martin, I guess he doesn't know the better establishments of this town. You see, I'm new here. I just got here. I don't know my way around yet. We'll have to escort him personally to our vocational center. BALES: You come here for work every day, huh? Well, once or twice a month, tops. That's enough. You make enough money to live on. (LAUGHS) I mean, we got unemployment, and we got free meals and we got... We got food stamps. Food stamps and Medi-Cal. Hell, all we need is a little pocket money. So, what do I do? How do I start? It's easy. Hey, look! Martin. Hey, watch this. Watch this. Do you need an extra hand? Yeah, sure. Do you know anything about carpentry? Yeah, I know about carpentry. How much do you pay? If you're good, four bucks an hour. It's a deal. All right, get in. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Back in the truck, huh? My man, Martin. (LAUGHS) Take it easy, Martin. Okay, buddy. Your turn. You got it. By the way, it's 5% commission. What commission? What do you think? I'm out here for the fun of it? Get outta here. Hey, I've gotta make a living, too. Hold it, hold it. Hold it. All I need is just a few guys now. Uh, how about you? Okay, you. I can use the job. How about you? Let's get into the car. Say, uh, what's the job? Scraping walls for painting. Say, uh, I don't wanna take this job. It's too dirty. You want it? Yeah. Sure, I'll go. Okay. Say, mister, I don't wanna go. This man here will go with you. Uh, no, no. I'll take this man. What's wrong with my buddy? He's too old! I need young, strong guys. JEFFERSON: (MIMICKING) "Oh, I need young guys." Come on. Come on. Let's go. So, why didn't you tell me you're an ex-con in the first place? You ashamed or something? I don't go around telling everybody I'm an ex-con. Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed of. I mean, half the streets here are ex-cons. I got into trouble. Every place I went, I told them the truth and I blew the whole thing. I believe you, man. It ain't gonna help you. I mean, you can hide as much as you please, but the cops are gonna be after you every place you go. No matter what you do, you'll always end up in jail. Ain't just no way around it. I know. The only way to survive is if you got something going for you. A goal. And I do. Yeah. I've heard that story before. They must feed you that line for breakfast every morning, huh? Every ex-con I ever knew ended up back in jail. And believe me, man, that is statistics. Well, I knew I'd find you guys out here. You send me off to work so you guys just loaf around and wait for me to come back for the money. We didn't have any luck, Martin. Yeah, I'll bet. Least you can do is get me a cup of coffee. (SIGHS) So what happened to the job? Oh, I don't know. That guy asked me if I knew anything about carpentry, right? Yeah. And he took me to this job. Building's as tall as the Empire State Building. Wants me to climb all the way to the top and do roofing work? The guy must think I'm a nut or something. Well, I'm glad I found you guys. At least now we can have a good time. Yeah, wait a minute now. Uh, you said this was a roofing job? (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (BREATHES DEEPLY) (PRAYING IN HEBREW) Amen. ALL: Amen. ALL: L'chaim. L'chaim. Children, I have such a surprise for our guest. Wait until you see it! WOMAN: Here it is! (GUESTS EXCLAIMING HAPPILY) LILLIAN: Do you know what it is? Do I know what it is? It's homemade chicken soup. I can smell it a mile away. (ALL LAUGHING) MAN: This Italian from New York, he knows! Yeah, I know! How did you know I like chicken soup? LILLIAN: Sheila told me. How long ago did you have it? BALES: About 20 years ago, in Brooklyn. LILLIAN: Ah, you're kiddin'! In Brooklyn? Where did you live in Brooklyn? Borough Park. No! We lived in Borough Park, too. What part of Borough Park? BALES: 38th Street and 12th Avenue. LILLIAN: You're joking! We come from 39th Street and 13th Avenue! BALES: You're kidding, right? Right under the El there. Right past it, anyway. LILLIAN: You used to go maybe to Ebbets Field? Yes, watched a lot of ball there. We'd sit in the bleachers for 60 cents. (LAUGHS) Henry, did you hear that? He used to go by Ebbets Field. He lived in Borough Park. What did she say? He's from New York, Brooklyn. Oh, you're from Brooklyn? Yeah, Borough Park. (LAUGHING) Eat. I will. I will. This looks great. Thank you very much. Yeah. You know, 46th Street and 16th Avenue. There used to be a Jewish delicatessen there, Eli's. Remember that? They used to have the greatest chopped liver, and kasha and kishka and knishes. Their chopped liver, their knishes... Their knishes were good. LILLIAN: Not as good as mine. Probably not. Hey, did you ever have one of those knishes, David... What the hell am I askin' him for? He's not one of us. He's a goy, huh? (ALL LAUGHING) What's so funny? (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) (TRADITIONAL JEWISH MUSIC PLAYING) (VOCALIZING) (ALL CLAPPING) Everybody! (ALL VOCALIZING) Everybody! (WHISTLING IN TUNE) (ALL VOCALIZING) BALES: Mommellah. (LAUGHTER) Mommellah. Oh, I had so much fun! Such a wonderful time! Oh! Oy, I'm telling you... What a good time! (LAUGHING) Oh... You know, I had a family just like yours when I was a little kid back in Brooklyn. Last time I had a time like this was back in Borough Park. I was no bigger than that little kid over there. Tateleh, huh? LILLIAN: Tateleh. BALES: Is that how you say it, tateleh? Come here, tateleh. Yeah. Yeah. LILLIAN: Tateleh, huh. Oh. Yeah. SHEILA: He's a good man, Loretta, really. Well, he's helped me a lot with David. I just think you ought to talk to him. I do understand the problem. You've got a man and you've got a son by that man and then you've got Robert. I didn't say anything about leaving him and going back with him. I just said he should know. That's the point I was trying to get across. That's fine. Robert likes Bill and that's great, but Robert has his own father and he has a right to know him. Loretta, you don't understand. He's dying to see that kid. I just don't know how much longer I can keep this a secret. BALES: How's Big Carl? GEORGE: It's all the same. Three days in solitary. Nothing's changed. BALES: Whatever happened to Uncle Tom? You know, the old guy. He got out a week before I did. GEORGE: He's back. The poor bastard didn't survive. He couldn't make it. You know, George, it ain't easy out there. It's tough. Hard. Come on, Bales. Now I know that part. Now, skip it. Now, tell me the good news. Tell me about the boy. The boy? I mean, how... Well, he's a good kid. He's a fine boy. Fine boy. You'd like him. Didn't try to reject you or avoid you, did he? No, not at all. (CHUCKLES) He's a smart kid. Hey, you know what he did Sunday? Huh? He took me to the ball game. How about that, huh? (CHUCKLES) My own kid, he's taking his old man to the ball game. So, you're pretty proud of him, eh? Yeah. Yeah. He's quite a young man. He goes out on dates now. (BOTH LAUGH) Hey, you should see the girls he has. Gorgeous girls he takes out. Geez. How's it with Loretta? She's all right. Yeah. She's still working in the same place, remember? Did you find a job? Uh, well... GUARD: How are you doing, Pete? Hey, how are you doing, Murray? Okay. Good. Job. Yeah, well... Yeah, sure. GEORGE: Where? In a restaurant. The pay's not too good, but it's okay, you know, for the time being until I get something better. Yeah. Everybody thought you wouldn't make it, that you'd back because you wouldn't be able to hack it. But do you know what I told them? I said, "You don't know Bales. "He's different. "He's going to make it." Well, you see, I still got some problems to take care of. It's not easy. A lot of problems. What are you talking about? I mean, two and a half weeks, and you're all organized. See your family. You got a job. You're back with your wife. Look at this. I mean, most of these ex-cons don't even make it half that even after a year, you know. So I got lucky. Hey, that ain't luck. I knew all along that you could do it. ...we split between us. The two over 15 years were given to Judge Vincent for review and he told us we'd have an answer back in about two weeks or so, but I wouldn't count on it. (ALL CHUCKLE) And that's about all I've got for right now. Does anybody else want to elaborate on anything? Bales, what the hell are you doing here? I'm waiting for you to help me find a job. That's what the hell I'm doing here! I'll take care of this. Bales, you are not supposed to be in here. Now, you going to find me a job or not? Bales, just go back to my office and do what I said. I've been doing that for two weeks. Two weeks for one lousy job. Let me ask you something, Mr. Carter. Are you doing your job? Bales, what do you know about my job? I know whatever your job is, you're not doin' it. That's what I know. And how come you know so much? Because I've been there, remember? And I've seen all these guys come back. Every one of them come back. CARTER: They do, huh? Yeah, they do. And if you think you can help them by sending them to those missions, you're wrong. Don't you understand that? Bales, you don't know a damn thing about our job. All you think about is yourself. You think you're the only ex-con that needs help? We've got over 1,500 cases under our supervision. Every officer you see here has over 200 cases like you. And every one of you guys is so fucked up even two experts couldn't figure you out! And our budget, zip, zero, nothing! Well, I don't give a damn about all your other cases. I'm going to start thinking about myself from now on, all right? We don't give a damn about you either! Okay? We gave you a chance. Half of these guys don't even get that! It's not easy, Bales. And the bottom line is, employers don't want to hire you guys! That's it. Hello, Jefferson. How are you doing? Long time no see. Where you been? Where's your friend? I'm looking for your friend. Which one? Which one? The guy with the cowboy hat, don't you remember? You know, we went for the job together. Oh, you mean Martin. Yeah! Yeah, fine. Okay. Well, I'll tell you what. If you go three blocks to the south... Yeah. Right? And then when you get to the alley, you make a left. You might find him over there. Can you take me there? No, no, no, man. Those places stink, full of germs. Filthy. Come on. Come on. Martin, remember Bales? He's been looking for you. Come on, man. Take that damn rag off your face. I can't understand a word you're saying. I want to ask you a question. Just a minute, let me finish this throw. I'm hot. Hey, man, what are you doing? Don't you remember the guy who took you to that construction site about that roofing job? Oh, yeah. That damn nut, wanted me to climb three stories high. Show me where the place is. MARTIN: What? Take me to the construction site! What's the matter, man? Are you out of your mind? Come on, man. It's on the third story. You don't want to climb so high anyway. I know, just show me where the place is. I'm in the middle of a game. Can't you see that? It's important to me! Now just take me to the place, all right? I don't remember where it is. Honest, I don't. Look, Martin, roofing is the only thing I know how to do, and I need the job. (SIGHS) All right. It's right over here now. Come on. Oh, man, look at this. Messed up my whole shoes. CONTRACTOR: What do you want from me? Give him a break. Come on. Listen, fellas. Give me a chance. I don't need him. I got enough workers! Well, then why do you come down every day to pick up those guys down there who don't even know what the hell they're doing? Yeah! I'm experienced in the trade. Believe me. If you're such a hotshot, how come you're not working? What are you so desperate for? That's private, okay? Look, I just got a divorce. I'm in town for some work. All I need is a break. Listen, I'm not a social worker. Spare me your life history. Hey, what about the job? Are you gonna give him the job or not? He's no young stud, man, and I don't want him climbing up on that roof. I'm responsible here, man, and I'm not sure you can handle it. Let me show you what I can do. Hey! I don't know what you're gonna do, man, but I'm not gonna pay you one red cent! If you don't want to pay me, don't pay me. Just watch me. Carefully. Hey, Bales. Come here. What are you doing? Now what are you up to? I'm gonna show him what an old man can do. Bales, yeah, but this is dangerous. Now, you haven't climbed up the roof in a long time, okay? Why don't we call it off? Wait here. Hey, Bales. Bales, come on now. Hey, just be careful up there, okay? Hey, pal! The work here stinks. The lines are not straight. They don't overlap. It's gonna leak. Not strong enough. I told you he was a pro, didn't I? (LAUGHING) Come here, fellas. What's the matter with you guys? Come on. You're pros. You know how to work this out here. Look at this, they don't overlap. It's gonna... Everything's gonna come right through here. Give me your tape measure, I'll show you something. Now, you see that pipe? First of all, measure 20 inches down from the pipe, and start lining them up. Okay? All right, I'll tell you what. You start over there at that end. And I'll start realigning this side here. He's doing it. He's going to do it. I always believe in Bales. I told you, this man can do anything. All you've got to do is just give him a break. That's it, fellas. You see the way that sits over there? Those should be the other way around, those tiles over there. On the edge. On the lip of the roof. We're gonna do it! Okay, line them up over here. Line them up 20 inches from the pipe. We got a real professional job here, okay? Just line them up 20 inches from the pipe. ♪ Chasing my dreams again ♪ Now, I might be getting closer ♪ Or I might be nowhere near Watch your seams! ♪ All I know is my life needs meaning ♪ I'm going searching everywhere ♪ Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh That's it. Let's go. Louie. Take care. Thank you. You're welcome. Frank. How are you doing? See you tomorrow. I tell you, I had a great time up there. That was all right. You know, I didn't... -Did you see how he was up there? -Yeah. -Did you see those guys move their ass? -Yeah. You know, I'm proud of you. See you tomorrow. Hey, yo! Hey, come here. What the hell does he want? I don't know. Yeah, what is it? Wanna give you something for what you did today. Uh, thanks a lot. You're welcome. Can I come back tomorrow? Look, you're good, okay? You know the job. If I had anything else for you, I would have hired you. But you can see for yourself. We finished this roof. Maybe you know somebody that needs a roofer. Maybe you could recommend me to somebody. Hang around with the labor people down at that donut shop. I'll get in touch with you there. Look, I don't like to get dirty. I don't like... I'm not gonna recommend it to you, man. All this dirt. Look at all this stuff. You think I like... I don't like this kinda... Hey! Ohh! (LAUGHING) Oh! (TV PLAYING) What did you wanna see me for? Oh, I talked to Loretta on the phone and she said that she's gonna come and see you. She will? Yeah, she will. Will she bring my boy? I think so. When? Monday. A week from today. A week from today? Yeah. I'll see my kid a week from today! What am I gonna get... What the hell should I get a kid 14 years old? You don't need to worry about getting him anything. What do you mean? A father should get his son something. I haven't seen him in nine years. Come on. What... Look, wait till you get a job, and then you can get him something. I know where to get a job. In a week. Hey, congratulations, man. I don't know. I'm nervous as hell. I gotta get him a present. His old man, eh? (ALL LAUGHING) See you again next week. Thank you very much. Next week. Mark. Joe. WOMAN ON PA: Flight 101. Super Jet Service. No, I'm afraid not. There are no messages for Mr. Bales. I'm looking for somebody that's coming on Flight 552 from Phoenix. Are you sure all the passengers are here? Flight 552 arrived over 45 minutes ago. And the gate is already closed. Well? I think we better go home now. Yeah. Look, uh, I'm gonna take the bus back to town. I can drop you anywhere you wanna go. That's okay. I'd rather be alone for a while, all right? I'm really sorry about what happened. What are you sorry about? It's not your fault. You did all you could. I really appreciate that. It's just that... Thanks a lot. Here you go. LILLIAN: Hey, boychick. (LAUGHS) What are you doing here? Sheila told me I could find you here. Huh. So this is the dump that David hangs around in and gets drunk in, huh? She said you had some tsuris with your wife. Want something to drink? Nah. Well... Oy! Maybe a glass seltzer. A glass... Soda. Soda, you got it. (LAUGHS) Listen, I was thinking, you don't have to wait for your ex-wife. Tomorrow morning, you get on the bus and go down there to Arizona to see your boy. It's not that easy. I know, it's the money problem. Don't worry, we'll help you. It ain't that. I'm still on parole. I can't cross the state line. It's the law. So what? This is a special case. You'll go down, you'll talk to the police. They'll give you special permission to go to see your son. You don't know my parole officer. Listen to me, young man. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) You know what it means? Now where did you learn that? (LAUGHS) In Europe. I had some Italian friends in the concentration camp. Yeah. (SIGHS) Yeah. Listen, there was an old Italian gentleman, and he always used to say to me, "Don't give up." (SPEAKING ITALIAN) "Under the white ash, "the glowing ember lies." And it will fan into flames! And that's what I mean. Don't you give up either. Lillian... I don't know what to do anymore. Even the toughest man has a soft spot. You just have to find it. He is a father too, this officer, and when he hears your story, he'll let you go and see the boy. I know human nature. I know what I'm talking about, and I know he'll help you. And if you want, I'll come down with you and explain it all! Mommellah, I love you. (LAUGHS) Ah. (BREATHING HEAVILY) What'd she say on the phone? She changed her mind. She's not coming. Why? She's afraid. You told her everything about him, didn't you? I did. But maybe she knows more than we know. I mean, she knows him better. Maybe she knows something we don't. Come on, I can't believe that. In any case, I decided to pull out of the situation. I don't want to be involved in case anything happens. What could possibly happen? I don't know. He could hurt her, or her boyfriend, or Robert, for that matter I just don't want to be involved. Yo! Yo! Yeah, you. Come here. Your friend, the Italian guy, where is he? Why? You got a job for him? I got a big project coming up. I got 30 units that need to be roofed and I want to put him in charge, as my foreman. JEFFERSON: And how much will you pay? What do you gotta know? Well, listen, if he asks me what the job pays, I want to know what to tell him, all right. Tell him $4.50 an hour. $4.50? Yeah. Did you hear that, Martin, $4.50? This guy doesn't know what the market is. $4.50's a lot of money. JEFFERSON: Well, our friend is an expert. He doesn't work for $4.50 an hour. How do you know? How do I know? Tell him, Martin. I mean, he's at a damn good job right now. And unless we come with a superior offer, he ain't gonna be interested in working for you. Right. Tell him $5. $6? Last week, the guy came to me begging for a job! Why don't you go to the union then and get one of the union guys and pay them the union wages? Tell you what. Why don't we split the difference, 50-50? What do you say, Martin? I ain't going to make a fool out of myself. I know he won't work for less than six bucks. Right. All right, tell him $6. But I want a minimum guarantee out of the guy that he's gonna stay with me for three months. What about his minimum guarantee? I'll give him a two-month guarantee. Sounds good. Yeah. Tell him to call me at this number today 'cause we start work first thing in the morning. (WHISTLES) Don't forget, you have to pick him up in the morning and give him something in advance. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, man! I bet I know where he is! Where? Probably went down to his parole officer. Martin, do you know where it is? Yeah. Downtown. Downtown? Yeah. Well, Martin, how are we gonna get there? (TIRES SCREECH) We got us one. JEFFERSON: Yeah. Very nice. Englewood Carwash, can I help you? Mr. Hutton. Yeah, he's getting his car washed there. He's one of your customers, I think. WOMAN ON PA: Mr. Hutton. Phone call for Mr. Hutton. Yeah, hello, Mr. Hutton. Well, I am sorry, but I think you've got the wrong Mr. Hutton. (LAUGHING) Oh. Say, Martin, what did you say to Mr. Hutton on the phone? I asked him if he was that Hutton that rents cars real cheap. I gotta see my boy. And she don't wanna send him out here to me. What can I do? Fill out an application, and I'll take it directly to the parole board. How long will that take? A month, five weeks. A month, five weeks? That's the system, Bales. You know the system. Five weeks. And then will I, uh... You think maybe after that I'll be able to go and see him? Bales, I can't promise you anything. Hey, Bales! (WHISTLES) Hey! What the hell are you guys doing here? Phew! Say, wait. Good news. Yeah. Yeah. Bales, we found you a job! Roofing. Only thing is now you gonna be supervisor in charge of a big project. Okay? Now, two months minimum, steady work, $6 an hour, and he wants you to start tomorrow! Okay, so, hey, man, I'll tell you what, why don't we find a phone 'cause this guy wants you to call right now. Yeah. And we go celebrate! Come on. Hey, man, aren't you gonna say anything? Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hey, man, now you don't seem too happy. Yeah, I'm, uh... I am. It's... It's what? I'm gonna have to disappoint you guys. I can't take the job. I gotta see my kid. He's in Phoenix. See, Martin, now that's what happens to your head when you work too many hours in the carwash. Hey, man, it's $6 an hour, steady work. Do you hear me? I don't know how to explain it to you, Jeff. Maybe if you were a father, you'd understand where I'm coming from. Well, I would do the most important things first. But I can't. I gotta see him. Especially now. Hey, man, what can I do to make you see how stupid you're being? Nothing. Now that's damn too bad, okay? This is a chance for you to straighten things out. Wasn't it you the one that told me that I'd never get another chance? That an ex-con always comes back to the house, huh? Well, statistics, Bales, statistics! Now wasn't it you who told me about havin' a goal and all that stuff? Now, this is a chance for you not to be a number in those damn statistics. Hey, man. How do you plan on gettin' there? Take the bus. Oh, that's no way to travel. Martin, tell him about the car. What car? Martin, the car! Oh, yeah! Hey, Bales, we got this car, and we'll give it to you so you can go to Phoenix in style. BALES: Where the hell did you guys get a car? Well, you know, your rich aunt in Texas... See, he's got a rich aunt in Texas who gave him a nice car. Yeah, see, I got this real rich aunt in Texas, and she gave us this car! Right. Hey, man, now do you have enough money for gas? Let me get that $20. What? Gimme that $20. That's my last 20 bucks! Here, man, take this. Now I hope this will get you there. All right? Here you go. Thanks a lot, fellas. All right. My man, Bales. Looky here, say hello to the kid from Jeff and Martin, all right? I will. Okay. You drive carefully. I will. All right. See you later, Pete. Take it easy. (LAUGHS) How you doing, Sheila? Hi. Hey, listen, you need any help with that? No. I see you got yourself a new car. It's not mine. It's a friend of mine's. See, he let me borrow it. I'm gonna go down to Phoenix and see my son. I came here to get the address. You're gonna do what? Look, she don't wanna come up here with him, so I'm gonna go down to Phoenix to see him. But it's in Arizona. Are you gonna cross the state line? Now I know what I'm doing. All I need is the address. Now, can I have it, please? I can't give you her address. Why not? Well, she called last night. I'm sorry, she doesn't want to see you. You don't understand. I made up my mind. I'm going to Phoenix and seeing him whether you wanna help me or not. I thought you believed that I was right. I thought that you wanted to help me. You are right. But she has a point, too. Now what do you wanna do, wreck her life? I don't give a damn, a damn about what she thinks! All I wanna do is see my kid, that's all. You see, the problem is that I don't wanna judge who's right. I don't wanna be involved. I told you about my father, didn't I? I don't wanna see my son feel about me the way I felt about my father. I want him to know that he has a father who cares about him even if he doesn't see me that much. Now, are you gonna help me or not? Look, I'll give you the address if you make me a promise. I don't want you to ever come back here again. (SIGHS) (CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO) (SIRENS WAILING) POLICEMAN ON MEGAPHONE: Exit the car with your hands in the air. All right, relax, fellas, huh? I haven't got any weapons on me. Just take it easy, all right? Take it easy, I'm unarmed. Look, I got no weapons, I got... (GUN COCKING) Mr. Bales. Yes, sir. You know, you're lucky Mr. Carter's your parole officer. These documents he brought show that you did not steal the car, that the two thieves were apprehended and they confessed that they lied to you concerning the ownership. Under the circumstances, and under these conditions, the prosecution has agreed to drop the felony auto theft charges. Thank you, Your Honor. A couple of other things remain, you know. You violated your parole by crossing the state line. Your were speeding. You were driving without a license. If it please the court. Ah, yes, Mr. Carter. Mr. Bales has an exceptionally clean record. As his parole officer, I believe that he's the type of person who can make the adjustment and benefit from the parole system. And we were just about to grant him permission to leave the State of California. As a matter of fact, I will personally guarantee that he will return to face the traffic violation charges. JUDGE: Very well. However, I cannot set aside that $2,000 bail. As soon as it's posted, you can leave this jurisdiction. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Very well. Hearing adjourned. BAILIFF: All rise. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sign the papers and send them over to my office next week. Certainly. It'll be a long time before he's bailed out. Okay. Lucky again, Bales. Thanks, Mr. Carter. Thanks for everything. You know, you're a fool, Bales. What the hell was the rush? Don't you have any patience? Don't you have any brains? Look, Mr. Carter, I was... No, you look, Bales. You let me down. I could have made arrangements for you to get permission to go out of the state. But no, you couldn't wait. You couldn't give me the time. Now what do you expect to happen? You think I'm gonna pay your bail? You still owe me $100. Don't do anything that's not your job, huh? No more personal favors, all right? Don't get smart, man. 'Cause I'm the only person you got left to trust. And I got a job to do. You know, Mr. Carter, you're in the wrong business. (PHONE RINGS) The way you treat people... BAILIFF: Hey, Bales. Somebody posted bond for you. What? Who? I don't know. I'll take you down to the clerk's office and sign you out. Yeah. (CHUCKLES) You'd be better off in a used car business, kid. I appreciate what you did, you know. But you gotta tell me, answer me one thing, I thought you said you never wanted to see me again. You're the one that told the police I was your nearest relative. Remember? I'm sorry about that. I... It was the only name I could think of when they asked me. I didn't know they were gonna bother you. I didn't want you to come here. I wouldn't have come if I didn't want to. I started thinking about it a little bit. You know, what it'd be like to have a kid and not be able to see him. Then after I understood it... Well, anyway, here I am. Look, I got you into enough of my problems. I got you in between Loretta, and you and... I got you involved in a mess which you shouldn't have been involved with in the first place. And then the bail money and everything. Don't worry about that. We're even. You've given me a lot too, you know. Listen, you still want to see him? I don't think so. I blew it this time. I was... I pushed too hard, that's all. I did something that I didn't tell you about. What's that? Come here and I'll show you. Come on. I'm not gonna take the boy away from you. Well, what do you want then? I wanted to talk to him, that's all. What is it you wanted to say? Nothing. It's not important. Yes, it is important. Go ahead and tell him. Some other time, huh? Now. Tell him what you told me. Look, Robert. I... I didn't come here to take you away. You belong with your mother right here. I know I've been away for a long while. But now I'm back. I know it's been hard for you all these years. But I do want you to know one thing. All those years, I've been thinking about you all the time. And now I'm back, and you have a father. And I love you and care for you very, very much. So, I'm back. And if you ever need me, I'll be there. Oh, God, I'll be there. All right? That's if it's okay with your ma. So long, Son.
