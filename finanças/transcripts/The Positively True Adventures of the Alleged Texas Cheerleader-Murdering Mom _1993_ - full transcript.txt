The Positively True Adventures... ...of The Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom. Next on HBO. That's terrific, that's great. That's really the title? -The kid with the camera, do we need him? -He'll just take a few pictures. I have first-refusal or whatever rights.. Don't worry about it, we won't be shooting.... I understand. You can do what you want, and my butt's left out to dry. -We want only the truth. -I wonder about that. I'm sorry, okay? I understand you're cynical. I start talking and I get accused of being a media hog. It's perfectly understandable. -What the hell is that behind her head? -What? -It's prison bars or something. -It's nothing. What's like prison bars? This is supposed to be a documentary, not 'Geraldo'. Ain't there supposed to be a makeup person? Shanna. I've got it, okay. You know, this whole thing is stupid. This whole thing. I can't believe, I mean.... Look at that guy in Milwaukee, or Minnesota, or wherever... ...cutting those people up. That guy actually killed, people were actually killed. No one was even hurt in this case. Give me a break. They had me in the Swimsuit Edition of 'Sports Illustrated', but not in a swimsuit. Anyway, I mean, I can't do anything right. It is not even funny, okay? Look, there's Shane. Oh, yeah. Be nice. C.D., get us a Coke. Coke. -That's pretty good. -Yeah, it was. -You know her? -I could never do that. You see you're.... Thank you, Dad. -That was a nice back flip! -It was okay. I need some money for tonight. I don't have any. Go ask your father. Go like this. R.J., wait! Dad, can I borrow some cash for tonight? I pay your mom a lot of money monthly. How come you never have any? Hi. Did you see Bobby? -Yeah! Didn't he look fine? -Oh, yeah. How are you doing? -Hi, Wanda. -It was wonderful. -Good to see you. -We win, as usual. Goodbye, Shanna. You know your friend Amber? She's a cute girl. And I am not saying this as a putdown, but her family is not quality, okay? I mean, most she has to look forward to... ...is marry an ex-football player with bad knees who manages a Dairy Queen. Right, or works at a checkout counter and drinks beer. You are good. When you were a cheerleader, did you enjoy that at all? I never was a cheerleader, I never did that. My father was a Baptist... ...and we didn't consider cheerleading outfits appropriate. Did you resent your father for that? I had very good parents. My parents raised us well, my brother and I. I'm family-oriented. My family was always family-oriented, and so am I. You're still a Baptist. You still play the piano at church. Not any more. After the shit hit the fan, a photographer... ...from 'Life' magazine tried to take pictures of me playing piano, so I stopped. This whole trial was nothing but a kangaroo court with the media. I was found guilty with the media from day one. ''Jesus stands beside us ''Always through the rains and storms of time ''He will bring us up to Heaven ''His way is never hard to find ''Love's the key to our salvation ''Blessed are the ears that hear the word ''His power can purify a nation....'' Hello? Iwant to know something: I give you 4550 a month... ...where's that money going? Why'd you never make your payments on Shane's braces? 'Cause we ain't getting him a truck till you pay. Answer my question. I've heard you've been using my child support... ...to pay off your credit card bills. That was a clothing bill for Shanna. Want your child running around naked? Tell her her little girl doesn't need no Louis Patrone purse. Put the receiver back on your ear and tell your dumb-ass wife... ...it's Vaton, not Patrone. You on? Listen. We got to talk about something else. Shane, not now. Shanna's running for cheerleader. We need to figure out some clever little thing for her to hand out at school. -Is Dad getting me a truck? -What did I say? Verna Heath's girl won last year... ...'cause she ran around handing out Heath Bars. It's not just skill anymore. We got to play the game. This something you want me to pay for? This is your child we're talking about. It's something she's been working her entire life for. She's right here. What should I tell her? Should I tell her you don't care? I'll put her on. Tell her how much you don't care. Shit, Wanda. I'll split the cost with you, okay? You'll think of a gimmick for her? Something cute with her name on it. -Bitch. -Bitch from hell. Don't. Wanda, can we talk a bit about your relationship... ...with your ex-husband's brother, Terry Harper? I don't have a relationship with him, never did. But you had a relationship with him during the solicitation. The only reason I spoke to him was to get him out of my life. He was considered family at one point, and your kids had a relationship with him. -He's a pervert. -What does that mean? My dad gave a stupid definition... ...but he's done drugs and he's been in jail. What for? Drunken driving, stuff like that. It's all in the transcripts. He's had numerous run-ins with the law. Don't do that. He's been shady. Anyway, he's a very different sort of person. He's not one of us. You're now aboard KIKK Country Hits. I need to show you something. Got a minute? Sure! I've devised what I call my personal five-year plan. As my Christian advisor, I want you to have a copy of this list... ...so that I can have someone to keep an eye on me if I happen to stray. Okay. The first two items... ...one: give up drugs, two: show up to work... ...I've managed to accomplish. Done! The rest, I hope to do in the next five years. Three: give up drink. I'm starting that as of today. Four: give up smoking. I'm going to cut myself a little slack. Five: improve myself financially. Six: get more stability in my personal life. All you men got your permits? They're all right. Marla is putting Drano on herself again. What? Marla is putting Drano on herself again. Oh, boy! The thing is, Marla is a good woman! I mean, you can't find a better wife, a better lover... ...a better housekeeper, you name it. You put it all out on the table, she rates a 10 on each of those items. And then there's that other side to her, Part 2. You flip the record over, you have to rate her all ones and zeros. Don't touch that valve! All clear. Didn't you men read the tank? You want to blow the whole plant up? Pay attention or your wives will be identifying you... ...by your dental records. -We were told that was a safe area. -It wasn't. You were in the wrong fucking quadrant! Goddamn plant keeps hiring goddamn contract workers! Don't know what the fuck they're doing! -Don't let him do that, all right? -What? It's just fine. You just keep doing a good job. Wanda, Shanna's back flips are starting to look really good! They've always been good, they're just getting better. Oh, God! She sure has that down, doesn't she? Yeah, but she'll never make cheerleader. Her boobs are too big! Hey, you! You are so good out there. l love watching you on that floor. You are good. I want to know if my little girl is giving you any trouble? No, she's a very good student, Mrs. Holloway. She sure has been working hard. Yes, she does. I will see you all next week. -Bye. -Okay. Bye, Shanna. I'm so tired. She just didn't want to go on and on about you in front of Amber. -Honey, how much did these cost? -Tony's paying for half. -How much? -You know.... Each of us is paying 4160 or so. God Almighty, 4320 for a junior-high campaign? But you throw away money on stocks and fishing boats... ...and all kinds of businesses that bite the big one. Listen, these rulers are a guaranteed investment, okay? Say these rulers help Shanna win cheerleader, which they will... ...her stock goes up right there. Then next year, she's a shoo-in for high-school cheerleader. Great! We're building up her portfolio. She's learning how to be in front of people. She's gaining in poise and personality, and then next... ...she gets a scholarship to college. How much will you be saving right there? You tell me how much it costs to send a kid to college. She gets a modeling career, does movies, makes lots of money... ...and buys you a bungalow to set your cheap old butt down in your old age. She'll bring a whole lot more in return than one of your dried-up old oil wells. Yeah, okay. If there can only be four girls from the seventh grade... ...and four girls from the eighth grade, but say there are more qualified girls... ...from one particular grade, then couldn't we just.. No, we couldn't. All right, let us all turn to Page 3 of the Cheerleader Constitution. Campaign material will be limited to printed handouts only. No candy, gum... ...pins, or other materials that will cause distraction... ...among the students is allowed. That's different from last year when they could hand out anything. How come you're changing the rules without telling us? I am telling you. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Bye-bye. We had 500 of these things made up already now. -I'm not going to just throw them away. -I'm really sorry, Mrs. Holloway. I already had to say no to a lady who wanted to pass out book covers... ...with her daughter's face printed on it. -It's just getting out of hand. -I don't understand something here. Last year, Verna Heath's daughter came over here and handed out candy. -See, that's exactly.. -No, let me finish. Thank you. Her daughter, who was going to a private school... ...and, by those rules, was not qualified to run... ...she took up a space my daughter should've had... ...because y'all bent the rules to accommodate her. But now, you're saying that you can't bend the rules anymore. ls that right? -Mrs. Holloway.. -No, it's fine. I just wanted you all to be aware of that. That's all. Have you passed on a particular philosophy to your children? I've always stressed to my kids to do the best they could... ...in school and life and whatever. That's basically how I brought them up. Right now, Shanna's taking modeling. -Do you want to be a model? -Yeah, I like to model and I like acting, too. She may do modeling eventually... ...but it's also to make her a more polished, rounded-out person. Does Amber take modeling? -I don't know. -No, she doesn't. What do you learn in modeling? We learn how to walk, like runway... ...and how to dress, trendy clothes, classic clothes. Manners, how to get in and out of a car. -Manners? -Etiquette. Etiquette. lt's real interesting. What would you say is the one thing your mother taught you? Was it to go to school, you know, that type of thing? Go to school, go to church. Do unto others as they do unto you. -To be a good person. That's basically it. -Great. Hussein in return, demands $2.5 billion from Kuwait... ...which Iraq claims is the value of oil stolen from the Rumaylah oil fields. John North, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Come out of their momma's bellies full of appearance, promise... ...and then it begins. Poor souls. Girls come into the world out of their momma's bellies... ...full of appearance, promise and then it begins. The twisting of their souls, it's not the father. It's not the mother that imparts the poison. It's the father through the mother. It's his poison. Always the poor baby child. Then onto the baby child, vicious, venomous semen... ...pumped and injected into the mother, and the baby child gets it, can't help it. Marla. It's not the mother that imparts the poison, it's the father. Shut up, will you? Violence. Baby girls. Shut up. ...a proposal to castrate violent criminals.... Get my book. Why are you so mean to me? I'm mean because you're crazy. You stop being crazy, I stop being mean. But I'm crazy because you're mean. We got a problem then, don't we? ...investors paid $57,000 for a 260-pound pig named Ziggy. Don't do that. Explode! Ignite! The Hornet team is dynamite! Gymnastics: Amber Heath. Pompons: Amber Heath. Ready! Okay! Hit it! Explode! Ignite! The Hornet team is dynamite! Explode! Ignite! The Hornet team is dynamite! Gymnastics: Shanna Harper. Pompons: Shanna Harper. Ready! Okay! Hit it! Explode! Ignite! The Hornet team is dynamite! Explode! Ignite! The Hornet team is dynamite! All right, congratulations. You girls who have made the final cut... ...are qualified to run for the four positions... ...on the eighth-grade cheerleading squad. Four posters only... ...no larger than 3 feet by 4 feet. Handouts are limited to paper fliers only... ...of any color or shape. Handheld signs are acceptable. Okay, everybody should have done five posters. I got the solution. Stop with that fat thing. We've got to use these. And forget about the red and the pink. Am I going to get a truck for college? God, that looks so sharp. I love the purple! We ran out of paint sticks for the handles. I didn't get enough? If nobody wants to get me one, I'll go get one myself. Just a minute. Can you pick up more paint sticks at the store tomorrow? Why don't you use the rulers we spent all that money on? All I want to know is if you or Dad are serious about getting me a truck. Can we talk about this later? We can't use the rulers. They have a rule against the rulers. They won't be handing them out... ...they'll just stick them on some cardboard. Hey. That's enough, mister. I'm trying to arrange my personal transportation as an adult! You keep sloughing me off for this dumb campaign. How dare you put down Shanna! Who do you think you are? I didn't mean. That's not what I meant. Get out. I don't want to look at you right now. Out! I think the rulers would be all right. Go get them, will you, sister? -Here, vote for Shanna. -All right. You aren't supposed to be giving handouts. They ain't handouts, we're taking them back later. Vote for Shanna. Amber, I don't think this is legal. She's passing handouts. -The rules say-- -I don't think it's any of your business. You could get disqualified for this. I really need to.. I can't believe you're disqualifying Shanna on such a little thing. We specifically discussed the rules. I'm not saying that we didn't. I'm saying we did not violate... ...any rule that was specified to me, either verbally or in writing. I can no longer be a sponsor... ...if I have to work with people who refuse to listen to what I say! Mrs. Holloway, we understand! -Don't yell at me. -I'm not yelling at you. We understand Shanna is a fine girl, but in fairness to the other girls.. Did Verna Heath have anything to do with this? -Mrs. Heath? -She's against me... ...because I raised a stink about her girl. Let me ask you something else. Why did you bend the rules for Verna Heath... ...and you aren't bending the rules for my girl? Why is that? I've never experienced such unfairness in my life. No, I will not! We have a winner. Nice victory, Shanna. Not! Shanna got disqualified. -Are you serious? Why? -She used rulers on her posters. Her mom threw a fit in the principal's office, but I didn't know why. Amber laughed at me. She and her friends, they went right up and laughed at me. What did she say to you? I didn't hear exactly, but it was about me losing cheerleader. She's a little bitch. Shanna got disqualified. Lordy. I feel bad for her, I really do. The hard thing in life is that you have to follow the rules... ...and Shanna's mother did not follow the rules. Wanda Holloway puts all her energy into promotion... ...instead of putting it into skill. With you, I emphasize skill. That's why you're so successful. That's why you'll always be successful. She and her mother are bad news. You want to know something? They act that way 'cause they have nothing else. You want to know something else? People like that, you gotta pity them. Shanna is the symptom. Her mother is the disease. You hang in there, sister. Because next year is going to be a whole new game. I don't want to try out for cheerleader again. I'm sick of it. Okay, fine. You go ahead and quit. Never mind the eight years of hard work you put in previous to this day. Never mind the money... ...me and your father and C.D. have spent on lessons so you could be the best. She's tired of doing it, just let her be. Excuse me! I wasn't talking to you, mister. Listen, I'm not going to see a bunch of low-rate nobodies break her spirit. This has to begin here and now with this family. You all understand? Good steak. Can you tell us about your relationship with Verna Heath? Can we cut please or whatever you do? I know. As far as Verna Heath ever being killed... ...I'm telling you, that woman was never, ever going to be killed. Verna felt competitive towards me... ...which I never understood because she taught baton. She had an advantage that I didn't have. She knew people I didn't know. -Have you talked to her yet? -No, not yet. She'll tell you when Amber made seventh-grade squad... ...I tried to get her disqualified and that isn't so. But there was competition between you two. This is my philosophy, and I told Shanna this: If someone is pushing from their end... ...you've got to push from your end a little harder. The athletes in the Olympics... ...getting to be President of the United States, it's all the same thing. There's nothing wrong with competition, as long as you keep it where it belongs. But I don't think that was the case with Verna Heath. Anyway, because of what was coming at Shanna... ...i had to keep pushing from my side, just to get her over the line. -Has your daughter been in 100 pageants? -Your daughter is obsessive. I mean, this is my mother here, and she loves me... ...but, you know, she loves me enough to make my own mistakes... ...and make my own choices.... -You know who I'd like to see dead? -Who? Francine Rich. She's a slut. She's no slut. She's a tight ass. Excuse me, Mrs. Holloway. Don't worry. Mom don't care about bad language. -You think so, do you? -Yeah, you're real progressive. -How would you do it if you could? -Francine? Tight-ass slut. Let's see, I guess I'd sneak into her car at school... -...and loosen the bolt on her drive shaft. -That'll work. You know who I'd like to see dead? Verna Heath. Oh, yeah? How would you do it, Pete? I'd take explosives and put them in her baton... ...so if she dropped it, bam! That's not practical. How would you do it, Pete? I don't know, I guess I'd have to think about it. You know, everyone at some point in their lives has said: ''I am so mad at so-and-so, I could just kill him.'' I say something like that... ...and everybody starts coming out of the woodwork. ''You know what Wanda said to me? ''You wouldn't believe what she said to me once.'' Give me a break. Look, honey. Hell has come to earth. This is like it did 10 years ago. What if they catch and they all blow up? What if the whole town goes? It won't happen, they got cut-off points. What if they don't work? Mommy, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. Go to bed. Everything is fine. Just go back to bed. There have been a lot of violent deaths down here: Refinery deaths, gun deaths... ...family-to-family death... ...husbands killing wives, that sort of thing, you know? Last year, over by the munitions dump, they found four dismembered bodies. I'm not sure what that was about. You know, then, over at the Fiesta market, a woman got bit by a snake. It was hiding in the produce. She was picking up some fruit... ...and it come right out and bit her on the hand and she died. I used to shop there. -But I don't anymore. -I don't blame you. But the attitude here is, ''Glad it wasn't me, you know.'' There's a general lack of sensitivity to what goes on around here. I don't have that. Things that happen, I'm affected very deeply. Like when people lie about me. Like what Terry said about me in the trial. Hello, Terry. What you doing here? How'd you find my place? I need to talk to you about something. -What about? -A few things. If you want, come on in. I said, ''If you want, come on in.'' We can't talk here. Meet me somewhere. All right. I'll meet you over at Bo's. I don't know why you didn't come in the house. I got shafted on the ruler thing. There was no way that Shanna should have been disqualified. No way, José. But you know Verna Heath has somebody on the inside... ...and she has those people under her thumb. You going to light that thing? -I'm trying to give it up. -Now's not the time. I want her and her daughter gone. -What are you talking about? -You know what I'm saying. -I don't. -Figure it out. Why you coming to me? I thought you might know someone with your vast experience. I don't associate with those kinds of people no more, I never did. Why don't you get yourself a Colombian drug lord? -He can sell them into white slavery. -You know any? Fine with me. If I did, I'd be a very wealthy man. God. How much would it cost to have somebody put down? -I don't know. 410, 415, 420,000. -Shit! That's a lot of money, ain't it? You aren't knocking down a five-and-dime store, it's capital murder. I know. -You love your niece, don't you? -Yeah, more than life itself. You know how much this debilitated her? If she don't win this one, she never will. She's never going to do it, big deal! Let the girl be her own self. I want you to find me someone. -All right. Let me think about it. -See what you can do. -I'll make some calls. -Sure, let me know. Fine. Come on. And what if Wanda finds someone else to do this thing for her? Then she'll say: ''I was talking to Terry one time and he loves his niece more than life itself. ''And it made him so mad when she was losing to that other little girl.'' You know? And then her and this person are going to escape... ...and leave me holding the bag. And with my history, you add one and one, you're going to get two. If I was you, I'd cover my butt. You've got to tell someone. I'm telling you. Excuse me, boys. I'm taking up a little collection for families from the Arco plant. I'm tapped, honey. Here. Thank you, boys. So I guess for now, all I can do is... ...wait it out... ...see what's up ahead. Sounds to me like she's just shooting off her mouth. Yeah? I wish she'd aim it at someone else. What, babe? I've just lost the meaning. -Of what? -Christmas. You're lucky you had it for as long as you did. Oh, Jack! I love this. This is just the thing I wanted. Oh, my God! Not in my head. Aim lower. -Cheese! -Thank you. -Is that the one you wanted? -It's great. Oh, God! What a great first shot. Check out those earrings C.D. gave you. Oh, honey, that's nice. They're really unique. Thank you, C.D. -Honey, you're welcome. -Sweet man. This church service in Houston.... Hell, yeah! Best year ever. No skimping this Christmas. Look what I got Mickey. She wanted to wait till Christmas to open it, but I made her open it early. Look at those. Check those out. Are those big ones or what? -Terry, I need to speak to you privately. -Okay. Don't you look pretty? -You look like a Christmas package. -She sure does. My mom wondered if you'd call her at this number. What for? I don't know, she just told me to give you that. Any time you or Shane need me, just give me a call. Twenty-four hours a day, I'll be there for you. I got a sick feeling in my gut about this. -Do you think she's setting you up? -Hell, yeah. She's done it before. When Wanda and my brother were still together... ...she went and told him that I tried to get her to go to bed with me. She said I propositioned her right there by Shanna's crib. Man! It's her word against mine. How do you defend yourself against something like that? -You can't. -That's right. I think it's time you go to the police about this. I'm serious. It's New Year's Eve. We're on our way out. You might think it's funny... ...but I'll take the heat if that crazy bitch decides to go through with this. -A bitch is a dog not a woman! -Cool it. I tell you, I think this thing is serious. Then you better go down to the DA's today. You just told me this information. If anything happens, I don't want to be implicated, understand? -Where're you going to be? -We'll spend the night at the Hyatt. I need to know where you are, in case you need to come and get me. Come get you? Why? l got a bunch of unpaid traffic citations. They might decide to arrest me for that. Can you believe that? I'll call a lawyer I know who handles traffic tickets. Call and leave a message on my machine, okay? Dad, which coat should I wear? You didn't tell him? I'm sorry, honey, I thought you were going to tell him. I called the hotel. They won't allow minors to the party. So you'll have to be on your own tonight, buddy. Sure. I could find something to do. Did you pack my blow dryer? I'll tell you... ...being New Year's Eve, we're not handling that sort of thing today. Just hold it a minute here. Just run that past me one more time. You're telling me that you aren't interested in a possible murder, right? Yep! Happy New Year. Mr. Harper, do you really think this woman is serious? You know, I'm getting real tired of answering that question. Mr. Harper, would you have any problem calling her on the phone? No, sir, I wouldn't. Hi, this is the Holloway house. We're not in right now, but.... Aren't you going to label that or anything? No, I'll give it to the Organized Crime Unit. -What are we supposed to do now? -We'll wait and see. Yeah, but what if she calls me? Well, Mr. Harper, try not to answer your phone. You have to answer the phone. Marla, come on out. I said you had to answer the phone, come on. ...members of the House and Senate prepare to vote... ...on whether President Bush desists in making war.... Crazy woman in here, crazy woman out there. -Fucking surrounded by crazy women. -Crazy women are made by crazy men! Bring that back! The Organized Crime squad is pretty busy. If you keep pestering us.. I don't care if you believe me or not. I know what I heard. I've done my duty. If anything should happen to that woman and her little girl... ...it will be on your conscience, not mine. I lined someone up for you. He's just the person to do the job. I don't know what you're talking about. You said you wanted to have these people killed. -Are you interested or not? -I never said that in my life. Yes, you did. Wait! You can't put words in her mouth. That's entrapment. You do know what that means. Yes, I know what that means. Just remember, you can't put any words in her mouth. I know. Does this mean I get to carry a gun? Damn, Blackwell, just spit on it. -There you go. -Okay, Mr. Harper she's all wired. Five minutes to 4:00, January 10. This is Sgt. F.E. Blackwell... ...making a call in reference to a solicitation to capital murder. The call is being made to a Wanda Holloway by Terry Harper. Remember, you can't put words in her mouth. I know. Come on. -Hello? -Wanda? -Yeah? -This is Terry. How are you? Fine, I've been thinking about you. You were? Sorry it's taken me so long to get back. That's okay. I was going to call you, but I don't know how.. -Wouldn't have been a good idea. -That's why I didn't do anything. So are you still interested in taking care of that problem? All right. How can I get with you? Can I get with you Sunday? -Terry, we got church. -Right. How about Monday? I can do Monday or Tuesday. Hold on, let me think here. How about Friday? Sorry, Wanda. You got it working? January 14, 1991. This is Sgt. F.E. Blackwell. This tape is being worn by Terry Harper... ...in reference to a solicitation of capital murder. This meeting is going to take place... ...at Grand East parking lot at Wallaceville in New Valley. Here you go. -Oh, man! -Oh, God! I'll even look around, make sure nobody is following you. -There ain't nobody following me. -Ain't nobody following me either. I got a hold of this guy. -What's the deal? -That's what I need to know from you... ...exactly what you want done. That'll determine how much it's going to cost. That's right, I know. I just need to get something done. They're already working on this cheerleading thing. I think Shanna has already sunk again. -Now, this is a critical year. -Shit, man. If she don't get in this year, she ain't never going to make it. You said last time that she might not even want to go out for it. -She does. -She's gung ho? She said, ''If I won't do it this time, I'm not gonna go anymore.'' -Her little ego can't take it no more. -I understand. -It just kills you. -I thought about this. It pisses me off so bad that Verna, the one I've been talking about... ...she had been going down there.. She had no reason to go to that high school unless she's kissing butt. How obvious can you get? -You think this is what we need to do? -I don't know what to do. I don't know anything to do, because we're.. -What does this guy do? -He does everything. He can break her legs, he can burn her house. I ain't going to help him. Kidnap her, ship her off to Bum-fuck, Egypt. Send her over there to Hussein. If I ever get tied into this, Shanna is.... The kid'll have to move. She cannot ever live in Channelview ever again. You know what the kids will do to her? You know what they'll say to her? That's another part of this deal we need to talk about, because-- How do you know someone's not going to get caught? What happens? I started getting scared. I think about this shit, I think, ''Oh, God!'' I thought you made up your mind, that you were 100 percent. -I know I want to do it. -I don't associate with these people.. But how do you know you're not going to get caught? Do they squeal if they get caught? No, these people, they're professionals, they don't get caught. It's getting muggy in here. What kind of money are you talking about? Give me an idea. 47,500. -I told you it's going to be expensive. -I know. You just can't go around killing people for nickels and dimes. I know that, but I don't have that kind of money I can come up with. -How soon is that going to take place? -We got two months. How long is that gonna take? Because this guy.. I know, I understand that. I understand, as soon as he gets the money, he's going to do it. What if we give him his money and he don't do it? That's where I made a little deal with him. Half down and half when it is over. -You're talking about 43,500 right now. -That's what I'm saying. Do you want to do the mother or do you want the daughter... -...or you want both of them? -What will be the best? You get rid of the daughter, she ain't gonna be doing nothing. That's what I'm saying. -This is your choice. -I just don't know what I want. I got to figure out what I can afford first. My husband would shit bricks if he knew I'd been talking about this. Are you wanting them dead, or just injured, or disabled, maimed, to disappear? If all of a sudden her legs just happen to come up screwed up.... That wouldn't look very good for you. A lot of people are mad at this woman, too. Maybe you can take up a collection. Now, this guy, he said he would do anything that you wanted. -What would you do? -You gotta leave one of them. Would you do it to the girl or to the mother? The girl's the hard one. Her mother's easy once you get rid of the girl. If something should happen to this girl, even, maybe, just a leg broke or.. If it was a car wreck, where both of them.... Her car blew up or something, where they both died, then it might be different. -Kill them both. -Like a car wreck or an impact explosion.... -I wonder if he could do that. -It wouldn't look so obvious. When they have this wreck, they'd be dead before the wreck happens. So the wreck would be the second stage. They could shoot them and no one would know. Something like that? Okay, I see. -Does she ride the bus? -No. Are you kidding? Her mother brings her, her mother picks her up... ...her mother does everything for her. Does her momma wipe her ass? Fixes her hair, you name it. The little girl's a twin. All right, now. I wanna give you something else to think about here. -You need to get serious with me. -Okay. -But he said he don't like doing children. -I don't either. I understand. 47,500 is the most for both of them to be dead. That's 45,000 for the girl, 42,500 for the mother. The mother, she ain't worth a crap, is she? Hey, girl. Maybe I should go with the mother. And the kid, you know... ...might be screwed without the mother. -Maybe it'll mess with her mind. -Maybe so. -Who are you looking at? -I'm looking at the cars pulling in. You don't know this little girl. If you knew her, you'd know. She's such a little bitch. You know, it makes me sick to my stomach. I don't know, I have to make up my mind. You just not gonna expect an answer tomorrow? I kind of expect an answer tonight. I mean, this man's not.... He don't sit waiting for someone to call and say: ''You wanna kill somebody for me?'' He's got other people he works for. -I just got to get the money. -He wants to be sure he gets his money. -I said, ''You know me, I give my word.'' -No, I wouldn't do that. He said, ''I want you to know... ''...if I don't get my money, I'll come after you.'' I said, ''That ain't no problem because I'll show you who she is.'' -I swear to God, that's what I said. -Don't say ''she,'' say ''they are,'' you goof. -Whatever. -It's ''they,'' there's no gender here. ''How'd the child get killed?'' ''This lady said she wanted the child taken care of.'' Boy, there's this light flashing on Wanda saying, ''Wanda!'' Okay. God, this is so bad. I can't believe I'm sitting around talking about taking somebody's life. God, I believe I'm going downhill. The things you do for your kids, God! Because today, in the Persian Gulf... ...what we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong. These words from President Bush. There are less than 24 hours remaining on his deadline for war. More after this message. I can't believe I'm sitting around talking about taking somebody's life. God, I believe I'm going downhill. The things you do for your kids, GodI -This bitch is crazy. -Thank you. That's pretty good. A little straighter. Mom, what are you doing? Let's go. There are people in front of us. You are asking me to run them over? Is Wanda there? -Yeah, who's this? -This is Terry. Okay. Just a moment. Momma, phone. -Hello? -Did you get my pictures yet? If she wants to know why her Uncle Terry's calling... ...maybe Uncle Terry wants some family pictures. Yeah, we got them today, as a matter of fact. Good. -She's still bitching about the price. -Picky, picky! What if I told her that this guy had given me a discount... ...since she's such a nice lady. Her husband ever give her expensive jewelry? That's a requirement for marrying Wanda. I had a couple of wives like that. I had four like that. That's why I ended up living in a trailer. What did I do this time? I have tapes on you and your brother. The two of you were plotting against an innocent woman. That woman could get me in jail for that dumb-ass game... ...she's trying to involve me in. Your pills. Look at this shit. Shit, quit taking my stuff. -Conspirator! Liar! -Quit it! -Rapist! -God Almighty! Need your head checked, woman. -The wig fur is coming after me! -Where is it? It's on the floor! There! No! -It's over there! Kill it! -Okay, do you see anymore? No, it's moving! It's still moving! See, it's all gone. All right? Okay. Now you.... Here, give me that. You wanna start putting everything back now? Will you stop saying crazy things? Your niece will hate you for the rest of your life... ...for what you're doing to her mother. I hope you're aware of that. -The truth is like iodine. -Goodbye. It only helps when it hurts. Momma, isn't it true that only a certain amount of people are allowed in Heaven? -And we're saved? -Because we're Missionary Baptists... ...not like other Baptists who, if they make a mistake... ...they have to start all over again. But Missionary Baptists, once saved, always saved. Your grandma and grandpa were real smart. They chose a sect that has guarantees. Okay, baby, I'll see you in a little while. You look real pretty. -Don't leave your Bible at Sunday school. -I won't. .75 each, running between .75 and .80, which is a carat and a half. Okay. I was on my way over here thinking, I'm not gonna screw you around no more. -This is what's gonna happen. -All right. This is what you call D-day. This is it! This ain't gonna come back on me. I'm getting scared. Nobody knows, right? Nobody gonna know? Nobody can point a finger at me. I don't give a shit. It'll only come back on you if you don't have his money. He'll have his money. -February 28. -He will have his money. I don't want her ass showing back up in Channelview. I don't want her, two weeks later, showing up... ...pointing a finger and accusing me, even though.... How can she do that if she's gonna be dead? -I don't know about that anyway. -I mean, that's what you want. I just want her out of here. I don't care if they ship her to Cuba and keep her there 15 years. I don't want her showing back up here in five years. I want her gone. You said you want the bitch dead. I want her gone. He didn't say he was gonna kill her. He said he was gonna send her to Cuba. I don't wanna know.. He didn't tell me what he'll do, just she won't be breathing any longer. Okay. -All right, gal! -Go for it. Thanks. -I'll see you later, babe. -Bye-bye. I hate that door. Mrs. Holloway? I'm Detective Helton, this is Detective Blackwell. You're under arrest for solicitation of murder. -You're gonna let me call my husband? -Yes, ma'am. You're allowed a phone call. There's a couple of cops here. They're going to take me to jail for solicitation of murder. Can you come and get me? Hold on. Where is my husband supposed to come and get me? Can you tone it down so your daughter doesn't hear this? Where should he come and get me? -I'll talk to him now. -No, you're not. Shanna, go back to your room. Ma'am, you can tell your daughter... ...we're taking you downtown for hot checks. All right. Now, what should I wear for jail? -Should I change into some jeans? -What you're wearing is fine. All right. And what about my jewelry? -I don't suggest you wear any, ma'am. -All right. God, I miss drug busts. I am so sorry. I didn't have time to clean this up. -Really, ma'am, it's all right. -My husband's coming home anyway. I don't think she understood what you just told her. Mrs. Heath, do you understand that Wanda Holloway... ...wanted to have you and your daughter murdered? -Mom, can I go over to.. -Don't come in here! I think she got it. Yes, I think I understand. Yes, I do. What kind of car does she drive? God, she drives a 1995 Grand Marquis. What color is your car? Yeah, a metallic, dark kind of gray. She got a busted windshield. License plate No. 475DEV. Her address: 1289 Tulane.... Why don't you just call the Health Department? They said what? Agents from the Harris County Organized Crime Narcotics Task Force... ...arrested 36-year-old Wanda Holloway at her home about 4:30 p.m. Shanna'll be spending four days a week here, instead of two. What if her momma goes to prison? Shanna gonna be here full time? Well, look at it this way. If Wanda gets put away... ...she won't be ripping me off for child support, will she? That's a comfort. I found a necklace that I liked. In one pocket, out the other. It doesn't look like she's home. I'll just park across the street, you never know. Mrs. Holloway, thank you for allowing me to come in. My name is Ron Reagan. I'm a reporter with Channel 2. I've left my cameraman outside. He will not come in unless you give me the go ahead. It is your call. -Hello, Harry. -Just a few questions please. Mr. Reagan, you need to talk to our lawyer. Yeah, Harry? She's right across from me. I just wanna ask her two or three questions, that's all. Tomorrow? Harry, tomorrow we're never gonna get at her. Fine. And the check's in the mail, Harry. How are you? My name is Harley Tat. I'm with the television show A Current Affair. Do you mind if I come in and ask a you a few questions... ...about what's happening with you? Hi. Wanda Holloway? 'Life' magazine. Just want to take a few pictures of your house. Anyway, I mean, you do not know... ...you just cannot believe what I've been through. You know... ...well, hell. Is there any way that maybe we could go inside and talk about this? I don't want to say anything negative, because I'm a forgiving person. We wouldn't want to hear the negative. I wouldn't ask you any questions on that. I will just say that time and again... ...Wanda has done these things... ...that you just would not believe. I mean, you just wouldn't. Is there any way we can go inside and maybe talk about this... ...sit down, maybe do an interview? You could talk to me about some of those things. No, I'll have to talk to my husband, because, you know... ...I don't have any help and I have all these kids. This has taken us all so by surprise. -Is there anything I can do? -Having our lives interrupted like this. It's Harley? You know, I have all these hungry kids back there. Maybe you could get us some tacos... ...or burritos, some Pepsis. There's a Taco Bell right down the way. ABC News. This has to be a trying day. How are you holding up? I have to get through. Mr. McKinney, as Wanda's lawyer, how will she plead? No comment at this time. I'm happy to answer any questions you have after.... You know the possible sentence here is 15 years. Are your children and you prepared for that? Wanda Holloway arrived in court this morning... ...appearing upbeat and confident, but saying nothing. She's a woman described as obsessed with her daughter's efforts... ...to become a cheerleader. Before you went in the courtroom, you said you'd have a statement. Can you tell us what went on during the preliminary? My client is pleading not guilty... ...and we firmly believe we can prove her innocence. We've no further comment until the trial, which is scheduled for the late summer. Verna Heath says she and her family had been deeply affected by the case. Wanda Holloway is out on bond. She and Verna Heath still live in the same neighborhood. She didn't care anything about my life. She wanted to ship me off to Cuba. She wanted to sell me into white slavery, you know? I mean, I thought, ''What about my kids?'' I have four.. Yes, I knew it'd be hard on the children... ...but imagine if this had been allowed to play out to its inevitable conclusion. It would've been far worse on everybody. I think, in situations like this, you've got to use your head. Someone once said, ''Your mind is like a parachute. ''It only works when it's open.'' I know for a fact your wife has been wrongfully set up. I will help you in any way that I can. I heard my husband Terry say to his brother on the phone: ''I hope the bitch burns.'' My husband is a very violent man. Once he grabbed me so hard that.. Ma'am, would you stick to this particular day? I heard him say.... He said to me before he made the call: ''This should get me back in good with my family.'' Meaning Tony could get his children back. God Almighty. You know how hard I've been working to get my life together? Quit spreading lies about me. You're messing me up! I didn't mean to. It's a time like this that a man needs to have his wife behind him... ...not making all kinds of crazy shit about me! No one asked me to be on the TV. I saw you on the TV. You were on, but no one asked me. Where do I start? I'm a lawyer here in Houston. -I'm looking at it right now. -Most people think I'm either a sleazeball... -You believe this guy? What do you think? -...or a slimebag. I do some civil work. I need a lawyer, for my own protection, for my kid's protection... ...partly to have someone get me a deal on the movie rights. I'm 6' 8'', and, no, I never played basketball. I got camera crews crawling all over the school. I got the Heath girl and her mother standing right outside my office. You've got to get some people. Let me talk to the chief now. The argument to kill a child to help a child... ...does that make sense? I've got a bunch of pictures, but they're valuable family heirlooms. I couldn't possibly let you have them for less than 41,000 apiece. Okay, 4500. Plus, I can give you insight as to the nature of my ex-wife. I can get you access... ...to my daughter, Shanna, my son, Shane, and my brother, Terry. ...think trying Wanda Holloway... ...is ever gonna be a waste of the taxpayer's money. Often, giving forgiveness is easier than receiving it. The Lord is always willing to forgive us, but it's up to us to ask. Too often, we're so ashamed of whatever we've done... ...that we'll cut ourselves off from the Lord's love. Let us all take a moment now for a silent meditation... ...for any of our parishioners who are sick, troubled or indicted. 11:00, I turn the security on. You each have a free-zone path to the bathroom... ...but if you divert to my or Mickey's bedroom or downstairs... ...the alarm goes off. So if you want water, want a little snack in middle of the night... ...you got to bring your supplies up beforehand. Understand? -Did you sell my rights to movie people? -No, I sold my rights. Mom says you're stealing my story. I haven't lived with Mom for two months. She's still taking child support. Maybe she'd pay half for Shane's truck or contribute to his college. Mom says they're my rights. You can't sell them until they prove she's guilty or not. lt's her story, not yours! Man. Them two are getting to be more alike everyday. It's part of their symbiotic relationship. Afraid so. Shanna, I'm turning the alarm on. This is the most bizarre item of the week. True story. A woman in Texas who wanted to ensure her daughter... ...would make the cheerleading squad... ...I guess it was in high school, tried to kill a rival girl's mother. Is that strange? She was arrested while was she hunting for a hit man. It wasn't apparently hard to find her. She was on Main Street with some pompons yelling: Give me a ''G''! Give me a ''U''! Give me an ''N''! Give me a gun! How about that Wanda Holloway? Did you hear about this crazy lady? She tried to have her daughter's cheerleading rival killed. This woman is a housewife. How was she gonna finance a hit? I mean, how was she gonna do this? Does she have extra lunch money to spend on it? She's using the down payment with double coupons? How does this work? Maybe she's got some murder money in the cookie jar.. ...''Pompon Killers.'' Wanda Webb Holloway.. How was it on TV last night? It was so fun, I got to meet Donahue. And I might get on 'Current Affair'. Hey, Bobby, Marceen. See you all later. What if we liquidate some of my T-bills? Have we got any of those left? Wanda is going to be making some money on that TV show. You got any other ideas? All right. Thank you. Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't I just buy the goddamn paint sticks? It's a tragedy on the scale of a classic Greek drama. A comedy so perverse that the punch lines defy belief. Yet it's all painfully true. And the fiery fallout has caused a Texas-sized heartache... ...in a small town just outside Houston. -Do you hate Verna Heath? -No, I don't hate Verna. Those tapes are horrible. They are. Like I said before, I'm totally embarrassed and humiliated by it. I think you know right from wrong. You could've said, ''Terry, get the hell out of here. ''I'm not in the business of committing murder,'' and you never did that. I did once. I did talk to Terry, but it's not on the tape. You say you're not guilty of the crimes you're charged. But do you think you owe anybody an apology? Yes. The Heaths, my family.... Let's say she's watching right now. Talk to Verna Heath. I know that Verna... ...you were never going to be killed. I'm sorry for the emotional stress and strain on your family, on Amber. Neither of you deserves this, and I can only hope... ...that you all can forgive me. Are you sorry now and asking for the forgiveness... ...of all the people because you got caught? I did not get caught. I was set up. And I'm sorry. I just hope that the Heaths and the people of Channelview... ...can look back one day and forgive me... ...not forget it, but forgive me. And that's all I can ask. Right now, before our cameras, and before the God that you worship... ...did you ever try to solicit the death of Verna Heath? No, I did not ever. Before God. As God is my witness, no, I did not. More than 80 producers, agents and movie companies... ...contacted the Heaths. To weed some out, their attorney, Robert Schultz, said... ...he rejected outright ''anybody who called me 'baby.''' It'll help our script if you tell us anything personal. When I married Wanda, she was a very young, sweet, innocent girl. Very immature, I was very mature. Her family, they were nice people. But her mother made all her own clothes, they lived like homesteaders. I ordered B and B with rocks. You put water in this. -Sorry, sir. -Do the same for me, too. Okay. Will you all excuse Terry and me for a minute? I brought you so you could tell your story. Why ain't you talking? What kind of a deal is this supposed to be? These people sold my rights to this big producer, Pierce... ...who sold it to Showtime, HBO, one of those guys. It's like a snowball. It just keeps getting bigger. -I got a TV person talking to me. -Who? -I can't say at this point. -That's fine. Have you signed anything? Because what I got here's a definite deal. You want to talk about definite deals? ABC has given Grandma Heath more than you're throwing out to me. She doesn't know jack shit. Did Shanna get the birthday card I sent her? You know this snowball of yours? What if it starts to melt? So who's going to play Wanda? I haven't written the script yet and we haven't cast it... ...but I usually like to write with an actor in mind. -So who do you have in mind? -Holly Hunter. No, she's not right. I think it should be Susan Lucci. She is Wanda. She even has Wanda's laugh. That's who you should cast. Terry's a loose cannon. He sold his rights to ABC. They're set to make a movie, too. Can they do that? When there's money to be made, people think they can do anything. I didn't know about this. Is theirs going to be better than ours? Because their writer was talking to Patrick Gilbert down at the Y. What he told him was that ABC's was going to be real. Wasn't gonna be exploitative. Nothing like that. -And they said it'd be character-driven. -Never believe what a writer tells you. Can you give us a statement? Are you nervous? Can you give us a break here? What about the jury? Are you satisfied with the jury? Mr. McKinney, please.... Can you take care of that for me? All right, thank you. All right, I gotta go. Thanks. I've got a business to run. They've got me stuck in a witness holding room. I don't know when I'll have to testify, so I don't know when.... Hello? Hello, G.W.? Terry Harper? I'm Verna Heath. Hello, Mrs. Heath. Thank you, that's all. I just wanted to say thank you. Her car blew up or something where they both died, then it might be different. -Kill them both. -Like a car wreck or an impact explosion.... -I wonder if he could do that. -It wouldn't look so obvious. If they have a wreck, how can I be assured.... When they have this wreck, they'd be dead before the wreck happens. So the wreck would be the second stage. Wanda Holloway arrived in court this morning... ...appearing upbeat and confident, but saying nothing. She's a woman described as obsessed with her daughter's efforts... ...to become a cheerleader. But for now, her days of talking into microphones are over. You said your husband bragged about being a hero... ...in relation to this case. Yes, he did. He asked me if I was prepared to be the wife of a famous man and a hero. And he talked about the money he's going to make from the movie. Did he ever tie that in to threats towards you? Yes, he did. He told me I was trying to ruin his life... ...that he had worked so hard for over the last two and half years. Since he's been straight. And that if I got in the way, he's going to mess me up so bad... ...even my own momma wouldn't recognize me. -Did you take those threats seriously? -Yes, I did. Has he threatened you recently? Last Thursday. He held me against my will in his motel room... ...and when I tried to escape to my truck... ...he came right on top of me and was choking me... ...and started beating me on the back of the head with his fist. I then bit him on the arm and ran away. I have many bruises, but they're kind of faint. Here. And here. And one right back here. Right there. Did you tell the doctors that you had feelings of unreality? -Yes, I did. -Excuse me? Yes, I did. And did you tell them that you had flights of ideas? I told them I was seeing furry things on the wall... ...and hearing voices and things like that. What type of medication did they give you, ma'am? I do not recall the names of them, but if you have them there... ...I could confirm it. Imipramine? Yes, that's right. Why did they give you that? -Because I told them I was seeing things. -The furry things? Wig fur. Wig fur. I see. ''It was all a lie,'' Marla Harper said... ...of the prosecution's contentions that Holloway approached Terry Harper... ...to find someone to kill Verna Heath. Marla Harper's testimony was planned as a cornerstone in the Holloway defense. When she crumbled, so did that cornerstone. In Moscow, President Gorbachev sacked his entire cabinet... ...and ordered a shake up of the KGB. Why is it you don't sound afraid on these tapes, ma'am? Because I thought the whole thing was a joke. I did not take him for real. If it was a joke, how could you have been afraid? Because he had threatened me, and I didn't really know. I know how Terry is. I didn't know what he'd do. No surprises today, as Wanda Holloway stuck to her claim of innocence. A claim which prosecutor Mike Anderson said... ...was inconsistent with the taped evidence. Both sides will present their summations tomorrow. Terry talks about kidnapping, and Wanda laughs. She doesn't say, ''Let's go do that.'' She laughs back at him. It's a joke. They're meeting 'cause she's curious, and for no other reason. Later on in that same meeting, when she is trying to delay him... ...she says, ''Why don't you just tell him to hold up?'' Wind it up, Mr. McKinney. Terry and Tony Harper set her up. They framed her. Their motives? Terry wants back in good with his family. He's the black sheep... ...has been for a long time. Tony wants his kids back. Tell the world, by your verdict... ...tell Tony and Terry Harper... ...what's happened here is not right. And tell Verna Heath that your old friend was mad at you... ...but not so mad that she wanted to kill or harm... ...or kidnap you. That's what the truth is here. -Are the parties ready to proceed? -State's ready. Defense is ready. Very well, let's bring them on in. Mr. Foreman, would you pass your verdict to the bailiff, please? Mrs. Holloway, would you please sit down? We, the jury, find the defendant, Wanda Holloway, guilty of.... ...jury convicted Wanda Webb Holloway of plotting a murder... ...to help her daughter make a high-school cheerleading squad. After the verdict, Holloway was comforted by family trying to hold back tears. Verna Heath was fighting back her own tears, but refused to comment. Holloway left the courthouse with nothing to say.... -Holloway's going to jail! -Sit down! ...the killing of Verna Heath. The jury apparently didn't buy the defense... ...that Holloway was framed by her ex-husband and his brother. Holloway was sentenced to 15 years in prison.... Bet she's got her panties in a bunch, now that she's a felon and can't sell her story. If she'd been nicer to me, she could have had a cut of mine. Crazy bitch burned all her bridges. Holloway is currently out on bail. An appeal is being filed. Before the Holloway trial began, few folks outside the Houston area... ...had ever even heard of Channelview. Now that the small town has been in the national spotlight... ...many Channelview residents are wishing it had stayed that way. I couldn't believe they were giving me 15 years in prison... ...for this nothing little thing. And then, just when I had lost all my faith in the system... ...they declared a mistrial... ...'cause one of the jurors was a convicted felon. It's like, okay. There is justice after all. C.D., Shane, Shanna, they've been my support. People come up to me and say, ''How could you do that to your little girl?'' Do what? I'm not guilty. Shanna knew that. Shanna's always believed in my innocence, with or without a felon on the jury. Hey, Terry. Marla and I are getting married again. -You got divorced? -A month back. But now we thought we'd get married again. You're invited. I'll be there. Unless that means I've got to buy you another wedding present. -Can I ask you something? -Shoot! It's about my five-year plan. I've done some backsliding, which I won't deny. Which means I gotta make up for things double-time. Part of my plan was to better myself financially. Here's a question. Is it moral for me to sell my rights for a thing that was immoral to begin with? -I don't know. -It's a tough one. Pretty color. First, C.D. tried to sell his rights. I couldn't sell my rights because of the Son of Sam thing, but he could sell his. Then that law got overturned... ...and my lawyer went with my story to ABC, CBS, NBC. They all turned it down. They said the reason was that nobody got killed... ...and the story was considered too soft. But what I think is, maybe they were waiting for a good deal... ...because Terry finally sold his story to ABC for nothing, I'm sure. That'll end up being just another cheap movie of the week. Probably put in Barbara Eden, someone like that. How are you going to end this? I don't know. We haven't finished the script yet. It's not fair. I hope you know that. I've been shafted before, I could get shafted again over and over. Whether I rot in jail or not, people will look at me like I'm a freak. ''Look, there's the cheerleader-murdering mom,'' for the rest of my life. There was a point when I tried to use the press to clear my name. I went on the 'Donahue' show, 10 million viewers. Here I am. This is me. This is Wanda. We heard earlier that you have an agent and then you made a comment... ...that your daughter wants to be an actress and model. There's nothing dishonorable about wanting to be a model or an actress. I think she wonders whether the manipulation continues... ...and I think you want to deny that it ever existed. No, if, through this negative situation... ...something positive can come from this. Shanna has always talked about being a singer, being an actress, a model. If that comes from this, I think it's great. I'm wondering how their relationship is doing, the mother and daughter? How are you doing, Wanda and Shanna? You pals, you two? We're great friends. Me and Mom love each other very much and we do a lot of things together. What is the timetable here? Mrs. Holloway faces 15 years in prison. Momma, when they make the movie, can I play myself? That's what I'm planning, sister. Next on 2, Jeffrey Dahmer's ex-boyfriend... ...talks about his love affair with the serial killer.
