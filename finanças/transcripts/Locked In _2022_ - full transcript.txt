Locked in - May I? - Please, come on in. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, thank you. Give me the guitar. I can take it. Put your things down. I'm sorry for the mess. I have an exam in two days and I know nothing. Don't worry. - Put the wine in the fridge. - You didn't have to bother. We meet, at last. Oh, yeah. I'm Loris. Flavia, nice to meet you. You're tired. Do you want something to drink? - A glass of water, please. - Sure. How was your trip? I'd say good. I paid attention. Was the train full? Yeah, quite full. A lot of people wore masks. Strange situation. I know. If they cancel my exam, I'll kill someone. This is for you. Listen, I prepared my sister's room for you upstairs. Make yourself comfortable. The towels are on the bed, if you want to have a shower. Okay. What about a pizza? I had no time to cook. Sounds great, but it's on me. - No way. - I'm not asking. Really. I'm sorry to bother you. Not at all. I'm glad to help my sister's boyfriend. - It's just one night. - I know, but I'm sorry. There was no connecting train at this time. Aurora told me I could stay. That's why you don't need to be sorry. Shall we order a big one? Yes, please. I'm so hungry. I'll order half margherita, half...? You choose. Ham and mushrooms? Nice. Okay. Now relax, I'll take care of that. Thank you. Hey! Best wishes! For what? It's March 8th, it's Women's Day. Oh. I forgot that. Sunday night, the news on the virus, and I'm studying... - What's your exam about? - Semiotics. - What? - Semiotics. Oh my God, what's that? The study of signs. Like deaf language? Yes, but not only that. All kind of signs. You mean letters, music notes? Yes, exactly. A sign is everything we give a conventional meaning to. Red traffic light? That's a sign. You need an exam for that? Are you kidding me? It's tough. Semiotics is the basis of every form of communication. If I show you this, what do you think? The F word? Exactly. And you think that because we conventionally give it that meaning. Oh, so you study communication. Yes. No, I mean... Communication is a mandatory exam. I study showbusiness. Showbusiness? Like... theatre? Mostly. Are you an actress? I have an acting diploma. But I'm studying to get a regular BA. What for? If acting goes bad. Plan B? Exactly. You are an actress... cool. And you? What do you do? I'm a musician. I got that from the guitar. Yes. Do you play live? Yes. I sing and play guitar. I have some friends that help me with other instruments when I record... that's it. - Do you sing in English? - Yes. What's your genre? It's my own thing. And it's similar to...? There's nothing similar. But you have a source of inspiration. No. I take the guitar, I play and write stuff. I just write what I feel inside. Wow. And you make a living out of that? I could do better. Maybe some day things will change. Maybe. Aurora and you are so different. I know. She's a brunette, I'm not. She's tall, I'm not so tall. She has big eyes, I... I'm not talking about that. Then what? Forget it. Say hello to her for me, tomorrow. You don't talk to her? Our relationship is not typical. We love each other. We won't hurt each other or something like that, but we have different lives. I see. Maybe you know her better. Hey, I've only been with her a year. Okay, but how many times did you see her in one year? Not so much. We live so far away. Maybe 20 times. Look, I saw her at my birthday, at Christmas, and maybe I will see her on Easter Day. So why does she have a room here? Because she lived here before. She studied here, then she moved. She never asked me to come here. You arrived one year later. Okay, but she could come here, too. Every time is a journey for me, up and down. Maybe she didn't want us to meet. She thinks I'm the annoying sister. She's ashamed of me. You don't seem annoying. You've been here an hour and a half. Wait until tomorrow morning before making statements. Come on, go to sleep. Tomorrow you need to wake up early. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. Tomorrow you've a long trip. Go and rest. I'll clean here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Goodnight. Goodnight. DAY 2 Loris, wake up. What's up? There's a problem. What problem? No, Aurora. It's a mess. The whole country is in lockdown. Do you understand this? All of Italy is a red zone. We can't go anywhere! Jesus, may I speak? Can I speak? Let me talk! Thank you. I called the train company's customer service. My train is cancelled, and so are all trains that can take me home. They told me I can travel only for important work or health reasons, or to go back home. You are not my home. They mean I can go to my tax domicile only, got it? I can't come at your place. I don't have money for a cab. I simply don't. Shit, I don't know, I don't know! I don't have a solution! Please, come on. Please, let me think about it. Let me think about it. Aurora! Stop yelling at me, I'm trying to... She hanged up. Shit. Listen, I carefully read the online press. There's a form, a sort of self-declaration. If you fill it, you can go. How's that? You say who you are, you sign and you can go. That's all? It seems so. But it's open to criminal charges. If you lie, you get charged and pay a fine. Holy shit. Did you call your parents? Yes, I did, they're fine. Maybe they'll pick you up. How the hell can they? I don't even have enough money to rent a car. I'll lend you the money. Shall we look at car rentals? I already did that. They want 500 euros for a drop off in a different city. Forget about it. Plus, I don't want to go back to my parents. I thought you lived on your own. Yes, I live with two room-mates, but my tax domicile is at my parents' house. So I'll have to go there, and if this is the case, getting charged is better. And are your room-mates so far from them? At least 40 kilometres. Well, if you move now, you can do it. There won't be so many controls. What if there are, and they get me? The fine is poor stuff. The charge isn't. You should be super unlucky! I can't afford to be charged. Then I don't know what you want. Nothing suits you! Let me look at the hotels here. I'll go there, I won't disturb you. Then when they open the country, I'll reach Aurora, I don't know. There must be some cheap hotel here in Milan, I think. Are you kidding me? You want to stick yourself in a third-rate whores' place? If the country's in lockdown, whores won't be there. Loris, shut up and think. You're talking bullshit. I'm sorry to say that. You can't stay in a one-star hotel because they said the lockdown will last until March 25th. What will you do alone in a hotel for two weeks? Even if it's cheap, you will spend a lot of money because you'll have to order food three times a day, 'cause you can't go out. You'll kill yourself. So tell me what to do. You have two choices. You can fill out the form, take my money to rent a car, go and take a risk... Or...? Or you'll stay here. What do you mean, here? You would allow me to stay here for the whole time? Yes. If you promise me you won't disturb me while I'm studying, yes. No, Flavia, I can't accept. Then go home and take a risk. But I have clothes with me for four days only. I have a washing machine. And the minimarket on the road sells stuff. You and me here for two weeks? If you don't want to risk it, I don't see many alternatives. Aurora won't like this. Listen. I'll tell her. The whole of Italy is facing trouble. I don't think she can be choosy. So I can stay? Really? Yes. Thank you. Maybe the lockdown will end earlier. And if it doesn't, we'll wait. I'm calling my sister. Good luck. DAY 3 - Listen... - Thank God. What? I got an e-mail from the University. My exam will be online a week from now. Luckily they didn't cancel it. And you have one more week to study. Indeed. I'm sorry, did you ask me something? I would like to return the favour. - What do you mean? - Your hospitality. I mean... buying food, sharing bills. Thank you, but don't worry about the money. Flavia, this is awkward. I didn't tell you to stay in order to pay half of my bills. Can we decide who does what, at least? Okay, fine. What are you good at? I can clean. Can you use the vacuum cleaner? Of course. What about I clean the kitchen and the bathroom, you clean the rest? Deal. Okay. Are you a good cook? Can you cook pasta? Everyone can do that. Meat? Fish? I heat up frozen food. Okay, so we take turns cooking, 'cause we both suck at it. Deal. Let's to that also for dish-washing. If I cook you wash and vice versa. Okay. Will you take out garbage? Yes, of course. Anything else? No, no. I think we are fine. Oh. What about the computer? I just have my smartphone. I saw you have a smart TV. Yes. If you need the laptop, just ask. I have many books. Novels, easy stuff. Make yourself at home. Listen, what about establishing some house sharing rules? Yes, sure. I don't know your habits. I don't know your schedule. What do you mean? At what time do you wake up? At what time do you eat? I wake up at 9 or 9.30, lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 8, like everybody. At what time do you go to bed? 1 or 2 a.m. I'm asking you because I'm a morning person. I wake up at 6.30 a.m. to study, so I'll try not to wake you up. Maybe you can do the same when you go to bed. Yes, of course. Oh. How often do you play your guitar? I play only if I feel like writing a new song. If you need to use it, just tell me, so that we can go in our rooms and not disturb each other. I bet you hate me already. I don't hate you. I told you I am the annoying sister. This is your house. You can do that. Thank you. DAY 8 Hey! Is everything okay? I heard you shouting. I had a phone call with your sister. Shit, she really can be unbearable when she wants to. I'm sorry. You know what she told me? - What? - That I did it on purpose. - What? - To stay here. I know she doesn't trust me, but this is... Forget about that. I'm sorry I disturbed you. How is your study going? Badly. I know nothing. How's that possible? You study eight hours a day! Yeah, but it's like I can't remember anything I read. May I sit? Of course. - Can I? - What? I'll quiz you, so we'll see if it's true that you know nothing. - No, no, please. - Why not? - You'll get bored to death. - No, that'll be something new. Which book is it? Let's see. What's that? Don't! This looks interesting. What's that? Game theory. No way! Why? It's the math of semiotics. Explain. We use conventional signs even in games. We use them to win the game and cause our opponents difficulties. - Nice. - Tough. But fun, as all games are. Now. Maximum principle. What's that? It's the rational criteria used by players in competitive games. Yeah. Go on. Whenever a player plays, he makes a choice, and it's always... What does he apply? The maximum principle, which is the thing he believes will give him the best advantage. - And to do that, he...? - He uses signs... - Signs that indicate com... - Competition! That's right. Okay. And John Nash mathematically demonstrated that's possible. And what's ours? Ours? You and me locked in here. Ours is... a cooperative game. The signs we use show that we have a common goal: survive the lockdown. I think you're prepared. I don't understand why you say you're not. Because I know nothing. By the way, this is the first time someone is interested in my studies. Shut up. I swear! Not even your boyfriend? DAY 12 My father says hello. What? I called him because today it's Father's Day, and he told me to say hello to you and that he'll give you a present to thank you for what you're doing for me. You remember all anniversaries, don't you? Yes, all of them. It's a gift. A woman would like a thing like this. Tell that to your sister. I had to remind her of our anniversary. You often call your parents. May I ask you why you didn't want to spend the lockdown with them? Because five minutes a day on the phone is one thing, living with them is another. I see. Listen, we didn't talk about it since then... I want to apologise for that thing about your boyfriend. No, look, I'm sorry. I really overreacted. It won't happen again. How is it going with your new song? What? I hear you, you've been writing a new one for a few days. It's going fine. Every day I play what I wrote the day before and it sucks, so I start all over again. It must be hard finding inspiration. You don't find it. It falls on you. Boom. You just have to be ready to react when it comes. And when was this passion of yours born? It was a long time ago. It helped me go through hard times. The power of music. Yes. Come on, play what you've written so far. No. It sucks, and you'll get bored to death. No, that'll be something new. It's beautiful. I agree. DAY 14 - I'm sorry! - Don't worry. - I didn't want to! - Nothing happened. I'm sorry, I had to knock. And I had to lock the door. Let's not make this a thing. How is the "thing" going, by the way? Pretty bad. Yesterday almost 800 people died. They say the numbers will rise until Sunday, and then maybe we'll have some good news. I think the lockdown won't end in four days. I'm afraid it won't. Conte should talk on TV tonight. What about the food? Do we need something? No, no. I'm rationing it. Why? Precaution. Supermarkets are open. Yes, but it's better if you go out as little as possible. Nice tattoo. Really? Don't you like it? - I wish I didn't do it. - Why? Long story. Okay. - My shirt. - Oh, yeah. Right. You bought it at the supermarket? Yes. At least I have some more clothes. Right. You don't have tattoos? No. Is it a choice? I'm not comfortable with things that last forever. - You're a rare creature. - What do you mean? A girl without tattoos today? They'll put your face on the WWF logo: endangered species. - Really? - Really. Aurora has lots of them. Precisely. Do you like hers? Yes. You don't sound 100% on that. I don't see her since so much. I almost forgot what they look like. Listen, what about a movie tonight? Something trash. Sure. Don't you have to wake up early tomorrow to study? Yes, but they said Conte will talk late night. I want to listen to him to hear how long we must stay in lockdown. So why not doing something fun to pass the time? Great idea! I'll try to cook the steaks tonight. And we'll also open the red wine. Sounds like a great plan. It is. Your exam is in two days, right? Yes, but I'll never pass it. Yes, you will. Why so scared? I know nothing. Why so afraid? I don't know. I know it. What? You are afraid of other people's judgement. You're afraid they'll think you're not worthy enough. No, it's worse than that. You are afraid of your own judgement. I really beat myself up. You have no reason to. You say that. Facts say that. You are intelligent, precise, reliable. You can joke, you're funny, You're generous, look what you did for me. What have you got to prove? I don't think I'm an interesting person. - Is this a joke? - No, I'm serious. Where does this come from? It's the "second child syndrome." You envy Aurora? She has many qualities I don't have. Like what? She's determined, self-confident, and she knows what she wants in life. Yeah. And I'm here, I want to be an actress but I can't make it. I want to graduate, but I'm not a good student. And there's no comparison, Aurora's way more beautiful than me. But you are you. How can you live comparing yourself with someone else? It's not easy when you have a sister like her. Listen, you say Aurora is self-confident. I say she's too self-confident. She doesn't even think that sometimes she may be wrong. She doesn't, believe me. - Really? - We fight a lot over this. Why do you stay with her? First of all, she never cheated on me. She could do that whenever she wanted, with anyone. I believe she got many chances. Now, forget all the negative stuff I told you about her. She's great. I like that kind of madness she has. She's unpredictable, she... she lets emotion carry her, she's instinctive. She's a lunatic, in good and bad sense. Whatever I think, I feel I have to share it with her. And she has such a body! Yes, but for how long? Yes, but that helps. Attracting someone without that is hard. I disagree. How did you meet her? Didn't she tell you? No. She says nothing about you. Shit, I'm really flattered. We met in a pub in my town. I was playing live. She was spending the weekend with some friends. I'm on stage, and I see two eyes staring at me. So I start to stare at them, too. We spent the whole live show like this. After the show we started talking, she gave me her number, and the rest is history. Yeah, but... It must be hard having a long-distance relationship. It's not easy, indeed. Finding someone special is pure luck. True. I've been lucky. She's been luckier. I know I promised I'd never talk about it anymore... No, you're right. I asked you lots of questions. It's fair you want to know something more. What's your story? It ended two years ago. We had a good time together, but... he wanted something I didn't. I went rogue, but in the end he was right. Did you suffer a lot? Yes. I did. Did he ever come back? No. I didn't expect that. Do you miss him? I miss some things. His hair... his genius. His way of taking life. You're similar to him, you know? He was pretty handsome, then. Stupid! What do you like the most about Aurora? Oh, please... I don't know right now. Well, you said... she loves you, she won't cheat on you. She's a lunatic and emotional. And then you said... you like her body, but it won't last forever. Her tattoos leave you indifferent. You fight a lot because she's too jealous, and she can't remember anniversaries. We have a balance, here. So what's the thing you like the most? The reason you stay with her for. What is...? Right now? Right now. Her sister. You are an asshole. And I have to endure you for a long time. - Why? - Read there. Lockdown extended until April 3. Fm DAY 16 D♪ Emaj7 Em B7 - Hey! How was the exam? - I don't want to talk about it. - Tough questions? - I said I don't want to talk about it. - Are you hungry? - No. I say you are. However, if I may speak, being prepared is not the only thing that matters to pass an exam. What do you know about it? You didn't attend university. I didn't, but my cousin Walter did. He told me things you can't even imagine. Like what? What do you call the ones that follow the professor? Bookworms? No, the ones that help him or her during the exams. Teaching assistants. Exactly. So there was this teaching assistant, a woman. She was young, she was in her 30s. Teaching assistants are all young. Okay, fine. She administered four different exams of his. It sounds strange. No, it happens. Sometimes professors share their teaching assistants. I didn't know that. The point is that this one had a crush on Walter. - That's what he says. - No, trust me. Four exams with her, he's ignorant as a goat and still got high scores. He was missing just one exam. He decided to take it in September. Now, consider he's the kind of guy who spends his summer flirting with girls on the beach. Do you think he studied that summer? - I doubt it. - You're right, he didn't. The day comes, he goes there to take the exam, guess who's going to administer them? That teaching assistant! Now, before him it's another girl's turn. She was massacred, tough questions, she panics, she can't speak, and she gets a low score, like 15. You mean 18, with 15 you fail it. Yeah, 18, 19, something like that. The girl doesn't know what to do, she asks if she can think about it, the teaching assistant says: "Okay, I'll go on, next one." And now is Walter's turn. She sees him coming, she blushes, she's confused, she asks him three or four questions, easy stuff, probably she just asked him for his number. No way! He fails a couple of answers. Do you know what he got? 27. No way! - Piece of shit! - Think of the other girl. This is a terrible story. I know. But it means that if you failed today, maybe it's not your fault. You're still acting, aren't you? No, I'm just studying. Wasn't acting your A plan? Yes, but with this damn lockdown... But you're missing rehearsal. What should I do? Act for me. What? Act something. A monologue. No, no, too shy. You want to act on stage and you're too shy to act for me? An audience is made up of strangers. I am a stranger, too. No. Not anymore. I'll play a soundtrack. No, please! Don't make me beg you. What will you do? I'll try with Nora. A Doll's House by Ibsen. "I have waited so patiently for eight years. For, goodness knows, I knew very well that wonderful things don't happen every day. Then this horrible misfortune came upon me, and then I felt quite certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad's letter was lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would consent to accept this man's conditions. I was so absolutely certain that you would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And when that was done, I was so absolutely certain you would come forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: 'I am the guilty one.' That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and feared, and it was to prevent that that I wanted to kill myself. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind myself to. When the whole thing was past, it was exactly as if nothing at all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care because it was so brittle and fragile. Torvald... it was then it dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a strange man and had borne him three children. Oh, I can't bear to think of it! I could tear myself into little bits. As I am now, I am no wife for you." Hey. Thank you for today. For what? You know. Goodnight. Goodnight. - You're nervous. - Why'd you say that? You work out a lot whenever you're nervous. You noticed. I'm a good observer. What happened? You guess. - You had a fight with my sister. - It was easy. Why? I can't tell you. Okay. Don't tell me "okay" like that, please. - Like what? - Like you always do. You always make me tell everything. I don't make you, you're doing everything by yourself. Maybe. But today I can't tell you. Okay. She was worried about her period. Yeah. So I asked, "What do you mean?" And she said, "Don't worry, forget it." We started yelling, she got mad, she hung up as always. You think you slipped up? No! No. But she could just say, "Don't worry, it's fine, honey." Take it easy. If she was pregnant she'd tell you, believe me. Maybe I'm just tired. Of what? What do you think? I'm tired of this lockdown. Don't take it wrong, I'm having a good time with you, but this is going on and on... I know. It's like a prison. It's totally not like a prison, Flavia, please! Calm down! It was just a comparison. I'm sorry. Yes. I'm stressed. Come here. What? Why? Sit down. No, I don't do yoga. Just try. I don't believe this New Age shit. - You don't have to, it just works. - Not with me. No! Okay. Here I am. What should I do? First of all, breathe. Breathing is the basis. I'm breathing. Not deeply. Sit like me. Cross your legs, your back straight. Close your eyes. Let the air enter your nose, then push it down to your belly, then let it out from your mouth. Is this yoga? A part of it. This is preparation. You have to be in the right state of mind. Come on. Down. Push the air down. It's not going down. Lie on the floor. Face up. Close your eyes. This is the diaphragm. You have to push the air down to your belly. Keep shoulders down. Okay. I'll give you a little pressure on your chest. Breathe in... and breathe out. Again. Slow down. Gently... You'll hyperventilate. Again. How are you? Better. Thank you. See? Flavia... I know. Me too. But... Yes, but. - What if we can't resist? - We will. It won't be easy. - Only five more days. - No. They said we're in lockdown until April 13th. Even if they say April 30th, we can't. DAY 29 Hey. Hey. Heard the news? No. We reached 130,000 positives and we have 600 deaths a day. Shit. I called my parents. They're fine. That's good. I'm going there tomorrow. What? It's the right thing to do. What about the money? My flat mates sent me some. I rented a car. Are you kidding me? It's best for both of us. - You don't believe it. - No? What shall I believe? - I don't know. - Tell me. - It's just... - What? I'm sad... because you're leaving. How can I stay if things are like this? - Like what? - We haven't talked in days. - Or haven't you noticed? - Yes, I have! - Are you okay with that? - No, shit! No. So what? Shit, Aurora is my sister! - So what? - You love her, you're her boyfriend! But I want you! And you want me! This isn't love, I know, but please stop denying you feel something. I denied nothing! So what can't we do? Don't be naive! - We can't sleep together? - Of course not! Of course not! Shit, of course not! But you want it! I haven't been able to think of anything else for days! So what's the problem? Aurora is my sister. How dare you think something like that? Aurora is my sister! You can tell her you fell in love with someone else, but she will always be my sister. I can't do this to her! Then don't be sad if I say I'm leaving tomorrow. But I don't want you to go! Flavia, hey! If I stay, you know how this is going to end. - And what happens after? - After what? What happens after we do that, what happens after we fuck? What's your plan? What plan? Do you really think we can stay together with my sister in the family? What's your plan? Or maybe you... You... You want to indulge yourself fucking me and then say it out loud, so you can say you fucked two sisters! You know this is not true. And then you'll leave me! Is this what you want? Then what? Huh? Then what? Leave me alone. You don't have an answer. You don't have it. It's great you're leaving tomorrow. It's so great! Okay. I'm sorry. Fuck off! DAY 30 So... I'm going. Safe travels. Thank you. And thank you for having me over. It was a pleasure. Let me know when you're taking your exam again. And you let me know how it goes with your new song. Keep acting. You're great, that is your path. Remember yoga. Try and calm down and breathe. See you. See you. DAY 34 Do you know what I read? Lockdown extended to May 4th. Twenty more days. How long were you in jail? You did your tattoo there. How do you know that? You said it was a long story, and that it would have been better not to do it. And you got very pissed off when I compared the lockdown to prison. You also said you couldn't afford to be charged. You're good. How long? Two and a half years. Was it bad? I don't know. I had a completely different idea about it. Maybe I was lucky. My cellmates were all good people. They were there 'cause they committed crimes, but they were nice to me. Sometimes someone took in some drugs, but I always minded my own business. Guards were fine, too. They were hard, but good people. How many in one cell? When I got there, there were three of us. Some weeks later one was released. People went in and out, all minor crimes. And you learned to play guitar there. No, I played it already. But I improved a lot. You know, the others liked it. I eased the situation, and they loved me. How did you make this link? You said playing guitar helped you through tough moments. It did. So you had tough moments. When you are alone in your cell, waiting for the new cellmates, Thoughts kill you, drive you crazy. Your parents? You guess. It was hard at the beginning. But time helps. I think they love me again, now. But I won't ever live again with them, I'm too ashamed. I think they never stopped loving you. Yeah, you're right. You didn't ask me why I was in. No. You didn't say, and I don't want to push you. How can you like me? You have many qualities. Really? Yes, you're a great housemate. You're not a bad cook. You're a little more clean than the average man... You're not trivial. You're a good listener. You write wonderful songs, and you're sensitive. The day of my exam you were awesome. It was the right thing to do. Not everybody would do that. And you're also pretty handsome. I totally agree on that. You idiot! You see things in me that don't exist. No. You see things in yourself that don't exist. Whatever you did in the past, you're not that person anymore. But I have a doubt. What doubt? I don't remember if you're good in bed. Oh, really? I'm really drawing a blank. Let me fix that, come here. DAY 36 Today is Easter Day, and we don't even have an egg. We can live without it. Do you know that the Easter egg is one of the most ancient signs ever? By "sign," you mean...? - Yes, in semiotics. - Ouch! It has symbolised life since the origins of mankind. Catholics use it as symbol of resurrection. I thought it was something commercial, like Santa Claus. No. Actually it embodies the Sepulchre of Christ, therefore a new life. You mean in the 16th century they gave each other chocolate eggs? They weren't chocolate eggs, they were real eggs. Chicken eggs? They were painted, and they didn't eat them. I thought Colomba cake was the Christian symbol of Easter. No. Colomba cake was invented in the 40s, after WWII, to use the same machines used for Panettone. That's commercial. How could you fail your exam? I didn't fail it. What do you mean? I didn't take it at all. That's a pity. You'd have been great. They'd have given you a 35. - 30 with honours, maybe. - Okay, 30 with honours. Yes, but I wouldn't have had the day you gave me. It's Aurora. - What do I do? - Answer. Hello. Happy Easter to you, too. How are you? No, there's nothing strange. No, no nicknames. I can't, now. Yes, she's here, of course. Okay. She wants you. Hey. You could call me at my number. What? What? But... What are you talking about? Listen, I'm not having this conversation with you on the phone, okay? - What did she say? - This isn't working. What? I had to lie, do you understand? - About what? - She asked me if I like you. I had to lie to her about something so big. This is not the end of the world. We'll fix it. I feel like shit. You don't have to. Loris, we fooled around, but we can't run away from our problems, and this is a problem. I'll solve it, then. What are you doing? - I'm telling her. - No, no, no! You can't do that! You can't tell it to her on the phone, and not now, anyway. You said she understood it. You can't pit my sister against me. - But you care more about her or us? - What kind of fucking question is this? You're right. I ask stupid questions. - So what do we do? - I don't know. - Come here. - Leave me alone. Come here. DAY 42 Did they bring yeast? Forget it. - Really? But I ordered it online. - No. It's not there. The tomato sauce is here. Tuna? Only yeast and bleach are missing. The rest is there. What news... I'm going to the drugstore to see if they've something. - Tell me what you need. I'm going. - No, I'm going. - Are you sure? - Yes. I have to buy something. - Then tell me, I'm going. - No! I said I'm going! - What the hell is that thing? - Something. Are you sick? Shall I worry? Loris... I'm late. What do you mean, late? I didn't have it. - What do you mean, you didn't have it? - Stop asking stupid questions! I missed my period. It happens, sometimes. No. Two or three days, maybe. A week is too much, and I'm always on time. What? You're pregnant? I want to buy the test. Don't panic. It will end well. I'm going. - Look for the yeast. - Asshole! - I wanted to make you laugh. - Not now. Flavia! Hey, are you still alive? Flavia, I'm going crazy! Here. Read it. I don't understand this shit. It's negative, Loris. I'm not pregnant. - God! It's fine, isn't it? - Yes, sure, it's fine. So what? It may be a false negative. I have to do it again if my period doesn't come. Well, you will. - Do you realise? - What? What we are risking. We always use condoms. Not in the shower. - I'm careful. - You're careful... We will be even more careful. Loris, no. We must stop. We don't have money, we don't have a job, we have nothing! How can we stop? You're my sister's boyfriend. Do you realise what kind of mess it would be? If you're not sure with condoms, take the pill. It's not about what I need to feel sure. What just happened doesn't make you think we are doing something wrong? I don't... I... I don't want to risk it. Flavia, there's a million solutions. Loris, no. If I get pregnant, I won't abort. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it again, Loris! I don't... What do you mean "again?" Leave me alone now. - What do you mean "again?" - Please, leave me alone! What do you mean "again?" When did it happen? Was it with your ex-boyfriend? Yes, it was that time. He wanted to keep it, but I didn't at all. I didn't think twice. He told me I ruined his life, that he wanted to leave me. But I didn't want a child with him. So I had the abortion and ended our relationship. And when I did it, I swore to myself I would never do it again, because I never felt so awful in my entire life. And after I did it, I didn't know who I was anymore. And even if it was right then, there's not a single day when I don't wish I had made a different choice. So how dare you talk to me of abortion? How dare you? I'm sorry, I couldn't know that. I don't want to risk it. Not with my sister's boyfriend. You said it again. I am, Loris! You still think of me as your sister's boyfriend... Loris... Loris, if you feel just a shred of love for me, now you have to leave me alone. - Leave me alone, it's better. - All right. I got it. Loris, wait a second. DAY 51 Why were you in jail? Do you remember my cousin Walter? The one from the story of the teaching assistant. The one who spent his summers flirting. He didn't succeed every time. He believed he was failing because he wasn't rich enough. Because he didn't wear rich clothes, or have the right car. So he decided to take it to the next level. You know how? Holding up a jewellery store. But he didn't have a car at all. So he asked me. "I have to meet a girl." "Good, here's the key." The next morning I was awoken by the cops. They had a picture of my car in front of the jewellery store. They knew I wasn't part of it. They had already caught Walter. But he, and I don't know why, maybe for a reduced sentence, he told them where I really was that night. Where were you? At a party with some friends. All minors but me. I brought 300 grams of cocaine. That's a lot. However, the police had nothing on me. I could tell them whatever I wanted. But I couldn't allow Giacomo to be punished. Who's Giacomo? He was a boy, bullied by everyone, poor guy. I couldn't stand what they did to him, so I took him under my wing. But with this cocaine shit I put him in danger. He was 17 and I was 19, so I took the fall. They gave me three years for drug dealing. No home arrest, because I had a record for weed dealing. That's it. I gave them the pusher's name, and they caught him. For good behaviour, after two and half years I was free. You must be furious with your cousin for framing you. No. I'm grateful to him. I needed to go to jail. It saved my life. I've always toed the line since then, and I want to keep on doing it. I can't do it, Loris. I believe you. I don't want to end our story. But you once said you're uncomfortable with things that last forever. I know. I don't want to start something knowing it will end. I know. - I don't want us to suffer. - But... But if we don't stay together, I will suffer a lot more. This is the real problem. The problem is I fell in love with my sister's boyfriend, a stranger I decided to host in my house for two weeks that became two months. I fell in love because... after an entire life envying my sister, and two years of personal hell, he was the only one who could make me forget my problems. I fell in love because... every day from dawn to dusk in this house with him, I've been happy. Even when I wasn't. Because he was there. And I don't give a damn about his past, because his present time is my present time. To me he's no longer my sister's boyfriend. He's a wonderful person for me, today. And even if I tremendously fear Aurora and what she'll say, I'm less scared if I know he'll be beside me. DAY 55 It's wonderful. I just have to find the right words. Come on, let me play. It's huge. You'll get used to it. Let's recap. These are the frets. We count the strings from the thin one. Okay. Index finger, second fret, third string. No, wait, let's start all over. - Index finger. - Okay. Second fret, third string. Ring finger here. Middle finger down. No, here. Push. Push. That's it. Again. Again. D major. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Won't you give me the pick? - No. The first time with a guitar is like the first time with a woman. You need to feel her under your hands. Okay, I'll remember it when I have my first time with a woman. I hope to be there that day. Stupid. But I give up. I suck. Hey! You have to be patient. It takes years of practice. Listen, do we have some drinks left? Yes, why? We have to party. Why? This is the last weekend in lockdown. I'll reach Aurora on Monday and I'll fix everything. I'll come, too. - You don't have to. - It's my choice, I want to come. We will be fine. DAY 57 Aurora, hi. Yes, I'll come there tomorrow. Sure. Listen, I have to tell you something. You talk first. You talk first, please. Hey, are you okay? You're pale. Did you tell Aurora I'm coming too? We have a problem. What problem? Something came up. Aurora got sick? She got the virus? No. Then what happened? Hey, Loris. Talk to me. Loris! She's pregnant. What? She says it's my son. Do you believe her? Yes. It can't be your son, it's been three months since you saw her. Do you remember when we fought because she was worried about her period? She already knew she was pregnant, but she was waiting for the third month to tell me, because until then there's the risk of a miscarriage and she didn't want to scare me. And you believe this story? Yes. I was never too careful with her. Do you realise? She kept this to herself for three months. She did it for me. Loris, she cheated on you! Shit, you cheated on her, too! Don't say that, she loves me. She wouldn't ever do it to me! Loris, it can't be your son! Flavia! This is not what you think, this is what you want. Of course it is! Of course! But reality is different. Unless you know something I don't. It's Valerio's son. - Who the fuck is Valerio? - No, I'm sorry... - Sorry what? Who's Valerio? - Forget it. - Flavia, who's Valerio? - A guy she met at university! - Aurora has a lover? - I don't know. Maybe. - Did she tell you? - No. - So? - Forget it. Flavia! Who is Valerio? I don't know! - So? - I saw a picture on Facebook. She was at a party with some friends, and she was tagged with this Valerio, they were hugging, I don't know... - Show me this picture. - Please, Loris... Show me this picture! Apparently your Valerio has different tastes. - Wait... - Nice try, though. Even if you have such doubts, you're telling me nothing. It's just you and me, 24/7 for two months. You think about this and say nothing? You say bullshit like, "I don't know if I can. "I can't do this to my sister." And you hide this kind of doubt? I don't want to lose you. I just made up some shit because I can't bear the fact you'll have a son with another girl. You are crazy! Do you understand my situation? You play with me! - Yours were just bullshit, then. - What are you talking about? The envy for your sister, your previous relationship, the abortion! Shut up, you bastard! It was all true! Is this your game theory? Your maximum principle? The balance for you and the group? Bitch! God! I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you, too, but I don't know what to do! I'm sorry! For the second time in my life I... I was wrong, you were right all along. We had to stop early. We shouldn't be here right now. I'm sorry, I was wrong, I put the blame on me. And you're not comfortable with things that last forever. Don't say it, please. Flavia... we have to end this. Do you love me? I love the special person you are, but we must keep a cool head. And in this moment I clearly see something different for my future self. Do you understand it? I just tried to protect you. And you did it, every second, these two months. I don't know what I'd be if it wasn't for you. So this is the end. We have to look at the bright side. And what is the bright side? That this lockdown was a nightmare for everybody, but for us it was... a fucking wonderful daydream. DAY 58 This is not a goodbye. We will be together forever. How? When this virus thing is over, we will see each other every weekend because we will be part of the same family. We will go to the movies, on holiday together, we will take unforgettable trips. You will introduce me your boyfriend, and he'll be special, 'cause you don't deserve any less. I will come and see you on stage because you'll be an actress, and you'll come to my shows in some dirty pub. No, fuck it. At the arena! Dreaming is for free. And we'll forget everything. There will be nothing left of these two months. Something will. Look in your laptop, later. Quality is not high, but that was the best I could do with my phone. Your new song? Ours. You found the right words. Always knew them. Thank you for having me over. This will always be your home, and you know it. It was nice to meet you, Loris. For me, too. This film is dedicated to all of us that have been fighting this pandemic locked at home.
