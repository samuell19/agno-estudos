It all began many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many years ago. As if felled by some malevolent force, the very stars rained down... And the land of our ancestors once warm and bright with beauties rich and rare, was plunged into perpetual cold and darkness. No sun meant no food. Famine gripped the land. Animalkind was at the mercy of a terrifying new threat... extinction! Many didn't survive... But others... they found a way! The young possum found refuge inside the fallen star. Little did he know, he was not the only one. Had those younglings given in to their instincts, they'd have eaten each other right there and then. Luckily for them, the fallen star had created a sanctuary from extinction's wrath... A place where to survive, animals needed to trust one another. With a furious extinction approaching, the younglings had no escape. In the face of doom and desperation, the younglings used the seed to make a selfless wish. A momentous, stupendous, tremendous wish for the survival of all animals. And as quick as it came, woosh! Extinction retreated from the land... and the Wishmas tradition was born! On this very spot where that star had fallen, in this very chamber where those Founding Children made their wish, our ancestors protected that small seedling. And now, many, many, many years later, it has flourished into the Wishmas Tree. Ah. Ahem! And around it, so too did our home, Sanctuary City! We learnt to embrace nature to build our perfect paradise, to create different neighborhoods, building homes for all species. Sanctuary City is a safe space for all within it. Where animals of all shapes and sizes can live peacefully with one another. A city where we live by one simple rule. Do not eat one another! No matter how yummy they look! This city is the only truly safe place for animalkind. Our gigantic crater walls stand tall, guarding us from the ghastly dangers of... the wild. Boo! A place only fools dare to go. A graveyard where extinction rules over all transforming any creature into bloodthirsty beasts who will eat you up. Few have left to the WILD. None have ever returned. Therefore, we must remember to always live according to the founding principles we honor with the Wishmas Ceremony every year... we are stronger when we are together! And once here, well, who would ever want to leave a paradise such as this? Hmm? Hello, fellow adventurers! My name's Kerry Ringtail, wildlife expert, and today we're in the WILD, outside Sanctuary City. Now, do I have something special for you! Come! Shh, shh, shh. We've stumbled across a silverback gorilla. We have to be extra still. Gorillas have amazing vision and are super agile! Look out! Behind this rock is the most venomous creature in all the WILD. One drop of venom from those sharp fangs and... Ow, the poison! This is my favorite predator in all the WILD! It's a polar bear! Ahh, it's attacking! Look out! Roar! It's too late for me! Roar! No! Roar! Get off! Ahh! What a boring city! - Kerry! - Ahh! Petra! There you are! I've been looking everywhere for you. - What are you doing? - I've been adventuring! Exploring the WILD! Meeting the wild creatures. "How do you do? Ohh, what a lovely coat." Yeah... Okay, Kerry. Let's go. Just because you're the only possum who's terrified of heights. Take a risk once in a while, Petra. Whoa! There's more to this world than Sanctuary City, Petra, and I want to see it! Well, I want you to stop mucking around because we're late for the ceremony and dad's waiting for us. The ceremony! I need a wish! Well, it's not me who's gonna make us late, slow... poke! Because I'm taking a shortcut... - Kerry! - You're right. Dad's gonna freak out if we're late. Don't you dare. You should really stop slowing us down, Petra. Kerry! Petra! Buh-bye! Kerry! Argh! Weeeeeee! To the Wishmas Tree! Now! Punch it! Vroom, vroom, vroom. How's it hanging? Faster! No, no, no! Woo-hoo! Hey-hey! - Winner, winner! - Yeah! That was awesome! From the deep and dark monsters from the north and south. Enter if you dare into terrors of the wild. Terms and conditions to apply.. Ooh. Mm-mm. Whoa. Wow. Hey! What are you doing here? I have it! I have my wish! I have it. I have my wish! Kerry! Where are you girls? We're gonna be late for the ceremony... Dad! Dad! I have my wish. - I have my wish! - Hey! Woo! That was a good one! I know what I'm going to wish! I want to see the snow! We could have a white Wishmas. We could throw snowballs and, and do snow angels. Oh, Kerry, you know it's too hot to snow in Sanctuary City. No! Not in Sanctuary City. I wanna go to the WILD! Where's there's real snow and drop bears and terrors! Well, I have a feeling this year you're gonna get something much better. Now, possums, it's wishing time! - Ready to make your wish? - Yes! Dad, I'm 14. You're never too old to believe in magic. Quick, quick, quick, inside! I have a feeling some wishes might be coming true this Wishmas! Woo-hoo! I gotta get to the front! And so the main event. The Wishing! Excuse me? Sorry! Whoops. Ooh. Excuse me? Sorry! Whoops! Now, every child plucks one seed head from the Wishmas Tree. Not two. Not twenty-two. Just one. When I say make your wish, the more generous, the better then blow those seeds for all you're worth. Are you ready? Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! But remember, we must always leave one seed head on the tree so it can blossom next year. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever pluck the last seed from the tree. Got it? Ooh. Yes. Then I, Yarra, keeper of the Wishmas Tree say let The Wishing commence! That one. Uh, that one! Oh, no, that one! Oh, come on, Kerry! Pick one! Yes! This one is perfect. Oh, thank you! Hm. You all have your seeds, yes? And the final seed remains in the tree. And so the time has come! Time to wish your wishes in the true spirit of Wishmas! I wish people didn't think I was so scary, it's just my teeth. I wish I had a penguin friend who I could wear tuxedos with. What am I supposed to do again? I can't understand anything that lizard is saying. I wish... I wish I could see the WILD. Come on. Ha, ha! Yes. I beat you, beat you, beat you! You're the fastest possum alive, Kerry! Yes. Kerry, you're the best! You two are about to become the luckiest possums in all of Sanctuary City! Da da da daaaaa! Happy Wishmas, girls! Whoa! Oh, yeah! Wow! What is it, dad? Can I open it? Is it ice skates? Or a sled? It's an igloo! I don't know... It's a mystery! This is so much better than those sweaters you bought us last Wish... Wait, you love those sweaters! Had the bell on and everything. Well, this year, I wanted to do the best for you both! I wanted to give you the world! So I figured, what the hey! I'll... I'll just go ahead and give it to you! One of a kind, non-refundable... I'll... I'll just unwrap it for you. Haha! It's our very first TV! It's a TV! Now you can travel all around the world, from the safety of our own living room. Look, I'll show you. And here in Sanctuary City... This isn't going to see the world! I know! Isn't it great? Here she is now, Pelican DeGeneres. This is not what I wished for! I actually thought I'd get to go on an adventure! To see the WILD! That stupid TV is cheating! Wishmas is a lie! - Kerry... - Kerry, just stop it! Maybe before you run off to the WILD and get yourself eaten, you should learn to appreciate home a little more. Well, why don't you let me get eaten and then you can have the TV as your sister instead? At least the TV would be less annoying than you! You only like it because it's boring like you! Girls, let's just have some Wishmas damper... Ugh. Ugh! Mmm. Huh? Hm. Hey... Don't cross it. Okay... It's just, I know how much you like them. I'll leave it here just in case. I told you not to cross it. Okay, okay. Look, I shouldn't have yelled at you downstairs. - Mmm, I'm used to it... - Come on. Do you think I enjoy chasing you around the city? Do you think I like having to look after you... all the time? I'm not trying to baby you. Just... why can't you be a little more responsible? I'm gonna be stuck here for the rest of my life, aren't I? Kerry, Sanctuary City is our home. Our family. Our friends. Our entire lives are right here. Don't you see that? You at least have friends. Oh, Kerry... You don't have to run away for things to change. Okay? Rawr! Hm? If I can't leave to explore the WILD I'm gonna bring the WILD to me... Da-a-ad! Dad! Dad! Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad! Dad! Come look! Dad! Come look! What do you mean I'm a bear? I don't have any koalaifications... Look! Loo-ook! What the hey... Whoa! Wheee! Huh? What? Hey, what's all the noise about... Ow. What... Come on in. The snow's fine! I did it! I did it, I did it. I did it! I did it. Whoa. Ah! Ah. - Wow. - Wow. - Aah! - Woo-hoo! Mm? Hm. Huh? Argh! Gah! Ow! Oo-ee! Ugh... Oh! This is awesome! My wish came true! A white Wishmas. All thanks to me! - Oh... - I'm okay. The Wishmas Tree is... Dying. Yarra? Quite the sight, isn't it? It'll probably all melt away in a day or two. Wouldn't you say, Stick? Unless, of course, there might be more to it than that. Like if someone had been foolish enough to, let's say, pluck the last seed? What's that, you say? Someone might have tempted the ancient evil forces of Extinction to come to Sanctuary City? To open the gates to the monstrous beast that seeks the destruction of all life as we know it!? Uhh... Yeah, right. Gotta go, Yarra! Kerry, the ringtail possum. You must fix what you have done. Of course, saving the Wishmas Tree would mean embarking on a terrifying quest outside of Sanctuary City. The most dangerous adventure imaginable. Hm... Mm. Yarra! I know what I did was wrong, but I'm ready to do what is right! Are you now? Whoa-oa! Hm. We're finally here! The WILD! ♪ Kerry and Yarra on an adventure exploring the WILD ♪ ♪ Doo doo doo doo ♪♪ I've actually learnt everything about the WILD! Did you know there is a giant lizard called the Megalania that can shoot blood out of its eyeballs? And... and did you know the biggest ever wombat lives out here, with two giant front teeth that can crush a bowling ball? Mash mash! And it can shoot fire from its mouth and its poop comes out in giant cubes! And then, the seahorses, they hold each other's tails so they don't get lost! Naw! What's wrong? Is something there? Is it a polar bear? If you stop asking questions for one second, maybe I can answer one of them. Mm. Okay, can you at least tell me where we're going? But also, should I or should I not eat the yellow snow? Should not eat it! Here! Listen very closely. Here is Sanctuary City, with the Wishmas Tree at its center, and the crater walls around it. We are here! Wow, you're good! Nice detail. Thanks. But Stick's the real artist. Now, Kerry the ringtail possum, even in the WILD, there are areas that sane animals dare not go... A terrifying place known as... The Forbidden Swamp! It's a dead place, a smeared booger on the landscape, ruled by bloodthirsty beasts. Beasts? Beasts who use your bones as toothpicks and your feet for ear warmers! If you survive this unsurvivable quagmire, across the swamp is the ghastly smog-filled marshes, known as the Misty Muds! A bottomless bog that incarcerates the spirits of the dead in an inescapable watery purgatory! And if somehow, you aren't imprisoned there for eternity... We must pass through the Gorge of Near Black to find what we are searching for. The fabled Sister Wishmas Tree. Our holy Grail to undo this terrible curse. Legend tells us of a single seed that will sprout on the tree to grant a wish. But not just any wish. Only the most caring, the most thoughtful wish, will be granted by its magic... - Just one problem. - Yeah? This could all be a lie! What? Why? I have not seen the Sister tree. Stick has not seen it. We venture only by legends. All those who have tried the same quest have never returned. But what I do know is that this is the only way to restore Sanctuary City back to the way it was! I'm proud of you, Kerry. It takes a brave possum to fix what they have wronged. Remember, it's not how we make mistakes, but how we correct them that defines us. Ready? Let's go! This way! Oh. That way! We must hurry, Kerry the ringtail possum. For if the snow reaches the Sister Wishmas Tree, I fear it may be too late for all of us. Whoa-oa, get a sniff of this! The taste of adventure isn't always so sweet, eh, Kerry the ringtail possum? Especially when it farts in my mouth... Welcome, scrawny one! We don't often get visitors around here. Kind of you to show up just in time for lunch. Ignore him, young one. The cane toad's sole purpose is to bring misery to others. Now we're talking! I know you! I read about you in my book. But I've never seen a cane toad in the flesh before! What? Huh? Who are you? Kerry! Stay away from that thing! You have stumbled into your worst nightmare, little one. Fact, cane toads have one of the smallest brains of any animal... It's the size of a peanut in this noggin! What? It's of average size. And they can crush their victims in a blink of an eye with their abs of steel. Hey! I'm... I'm sitting down. What are all these things on your back? Food crumbs? I will get them off for you! Hey! Hey! Stop that! Ahem... Focus. Focus. You. Are. Scary... Okay, okay. This is the Forbidden Swamp. A place of death, fear and more death. Ruled by the almighty our murderous leaders. An atrocious tribe we call "Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! Hua whaa nua! That girl! What is that sound! How dare you offend our leaders? They will not take kindly to your singing. Umm... I'll be the judge of that. Take us to them! Kerry! No! As you wish, little possum. Go on, then. They will be excited to eat you... I mean, I mean meet you. Meet you. Yarra, look! A shortcut. Kerry, wait! Oh, what is wrong with that possum? Enjoy your stay, however short! Ew-w-w! - Ah. - Shhh. Stay close, little one. Calm down, Stick. The leaders must be in there. That path will only lead to unimaginable terrors. Well, I'll lead the way then! Why do I even try? Aah! Petra? What... What are you doing here? No! What are you doing here! We are going home... now! No, let go of me! We are going! The only place you're going to is butt-face city! No way! Is that a... Drop bear! - That's a drop bear? - I thought they weren't real. They're real, alright. Real cute! Careful, young ones. What? Don't touch it, Kerry. What are they gonna do? Cwuddle us to death? If we get eaten by drop bears, I'm going to kill you. What's that? Mm, yes! I think you could be quite correct. Are you familiar with the concept of the Yo-Yo? Then do what I do. I don't know if I can do this. Don't worry. I've got this! Ahh! Ah! Oh. Ah. Ah! Oh, no, you don't! You have bear-ly made it out of that one! Aw-w-w! Nope! Not working on me! Move! Quickly! While there's an opening! - But where? - Into the belly of the beast! What? The mouth! He means through the mouth! Ohh... Uh-oh! Whoa Kerry: Woohoo! Huh? Huh? What? Woo-hoo! - That was awesome! - Kerry! - What are you doing out here? - Huh? Sanctuary City is completely frozen and you're in the WILD, fighting drop bears with an old lizard! What are you up to? Eh, promise you won't be mad? Oh, I promise. Fine. I may have plucked the last seed head from the Wishmas Tree and caused the whole snow thing to happen. Oh, Kerry! Hey! You said you wouldn't be mad! Now I have to cross the Misty Muds, pass through the Gorge of Near Black and find the Sister Wishmas Tree to make a wish... but not just any wish. Only the most caring, the most thoughtful wish to turn everything back to the way it was, or Extinction will destroy all life as we know it! You are unbelievable! Oh, right, I forgot. You don't believe in any of this magic. So, I guess we'll just leave it up to the believers then just me and my new buddy, Yarra! Uh... Yarra? Ohh... - Uh... - Huh. Hello. Yarra! You should know better! Why would you tell her to come on this quest? Don't blame him! He wouldn't hurt a fly. Listen, here are our options. We can either go back home and all freeze to death or we die on an amazing quest to save the city! So... what's it gonna be? Both of those options suck! Well, what else can we do? I mean, what's your plan? I messed up and I need your help to fix it. Argh! Fine. Yes! Huh? Huh? What? Well, let's get going, slowpoke! The adventure continues! ♪ Kerry and Yarra... ♪ ♪ And Petra on an adventure ♪ ♪ Exploring the wild ♪ ♪ Going to the Misty Muds ♪♪ Ahead, little possums, is the Misty Muds, where the spirits of the dead, those long extinct, walk the Earth. We'll spend the night here. We must be rested to tackle the Misty Mud... Rest? Rest? We need to keep moving! - We rest. - Argh. Ugh! You're a real stick in the mud, you know that? For now, though, you must wait here. You dare not follow where I go. I'm not afraid, Yarra. I can go anywhere you can. You can trust me! I'm going to, you know... Uh, I'm going to do a poo! Oh, oh, oh! I... I see. Uh, well, yes, I, uh... dare not follow on this, uh, occasion. Oh! Yarra, you know so much about the WILD. Have you been here before? We should tell them. They have a right to know. Oh! Tell us! Tell us! Please? Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please! Okay. I was once a young lizard. Much taller. Old age really does shrink you down. I mean, I was barely hatched from my egg. I lived a tough life in a big family. Hiding from all manner of beasts. Wolves, mud spirits! And giant eagles! Karr-karr! Karr-karr! Karr-karr! Sorry. This was a time where Extinction ruled. A time where you couldn't wish for happiness. Only hope you weren't next on his list. It was a place of only sadness. What? When did that happen to Sanctuary City? We never learnt about this. No, young one! I do not speak of Sanctuary City. I speak of a place where predators and prey ruled. A place you call... the WILD! Wow! No way! You're from the WILD? Call me what you may. I wanted the same as you, Kerry. Change! I wanted this life of death to end. I put it into my head that the only way to change my world was to find the legendary Sister Wishmas Tree. I ventured there to make a wish, to relinquish my people from the clutches of Extinction. But, of course, I failed. I was far from ready. I underestimated the mud spirits. Fortunately, my father rescued me from their grip. But in doing so, fell victim to them himself. I never saw him again. Stick is the only family I have left. I selfishly thought I could change the world, and paid the price. I ran away from my family and stumbled across a safe haven called Sanctuary City. I'm sorry, Yarra. I learnt I was never destined to be the one to change things. I learnt the only way to defeat the powers of Extinction is if we all work together. Mm. Are you scared? Of course not! I'm not scared. I've been preparing for this my whole life. Good, because I'm absolutely "Petrafied." Pet... Petra-fied. Petrified? Please don't be mad at me. Again. I just didn't want you to keep seeing me as your bratty little sister. I'm not mad, Kerry. I'm upset 'cause you didn't tell me anything! You ran off on your own! I... I could have helped you. I was going to! But I just... I wanted to fix my mistake. I care about the city, but really, I just wanted to show you that I could be responsible. You know? So you would actually like me. I know I'm just a sister to you, but also, I, I really want you to be my friend. That's all I've ever wanted. Oh, Kerry. I worry about you all the time. Because you're the only sister I have, and I can't lose that. But, being my sister means having a best friend you can never get rid of. Whatever you do, I'll always be there for you. I can't promise to solve all your problems, but... I can promise you won't ever have to face them alone. You hear that, Misty Muds? - We're coming for you! - Yeah! Uh, you better, uh, watch your mud 'cause... Um, I'm not very good at this. No! Quiet! What is it, Yarra? Their eyes! Why are they glowing? They're under Extinction's control. Quick! Follow the stairs down to the Misty Muds. Find somewhere to hide! Whoa, wait! What are you... I have to greet our visitors. - Now, go! - Come with us! Proceed without me and watch out for the lights that glow blue! - The blue lights? - That's what I said! Now, go! Oh, just like old times, eh, Stick? Kerry! Come on! Kerry! Come on! P... Petra? Petra? The Wishmas Tree! I'm home! The Founding Children? Our wish has been forgotten. Huh? Wait, what wish? We wished for safety for all animals. No! I will fix this. I will wish everything back to the way it was. It is too late, Kerry the Ringtail Possum. Your world is lost. Extinction is coming! Petra. Petra, wake up! What? Has Yarra come back? It's the snow! It's catching up to us! Oh, no! We're running out of time. There's no time to lose. Let's go! Kerry, uh, shouldn't we wait for Yarra? Yarra said if the snow catches us, we have to keep going. He knows... Kerry. We should go. Now! No, no, no, no, no! Huh? Whoa! Kerry! What are you doing? Put that thing down! It's okay! Don't be afraid. Aww! Look at him! Look at him! Put it down! I'm gonna name you... Frederick! Actually, nah. How about Kenny? Kevin? Floyd? Bruce? Bernard! Bernard the Drop Bear! How do you like your name, Bernard? That is a wild creature! Just like the ones that attacked Yarra! Do you see any red eyes? He isn't evil, he's just scared. He wants to cuddle! Well, maybe that's his plan. And then later, he'll carve you up in your sleep! Whoa. Look, can we please keep him? He's lost, and he needs someone. No! One hundred percent, no way! Just leave him here! He'll find his way home. We need to keep moving! Quickly. Come here. Oh! Oi! Stop wriggling! Kerry! Come on! Shh! Why couldn't I have been born a bird? Ugh! Well, I don't see anything that looks like evil mud spirits. Greetings, doomed travelers. Here lies the Misty Muds, a monstrous mausoleum for the dead. Hey! Hey! It's you! The toad from earlier! Remember me? Kerry? The amazing singer? Oh. Oh, you? I, I've never seen you before. - No traveler has ever... - No, no! It's me! I was helping you out with your wart problem. You still have a few more, actually. - What? - Kerry! Get away from that thing! Cut that out! I need those to look tough! Petra, this is Augustus. We go way back. Augustus, Petra. My sister. I... I don't care! You've entered the realm of the dead. You may proceed, but you shall never return! Have you ever cleaned your ears? Ugh, gross. Alright, that's it. I'm... I'm done. I'm done. There's no escape. You will die. Yadda, yadda, yadda. It is coming! Um... Uh, rude. Uh, Kerry... Oh! Yarra said to watch out for the blue lights! - That must be the way! - "Watch out," as in be careful! We need to stay away from them. - They're moving away! Quick! - Ugh! - Ah. Oh, it's an evil mud spirit. He doesn't look evil to me. He looks... frightened. It all makes sense! What are you talking about? I had a dream where the Founding Children told me their wish has been forgotten. And they were right. The Founding Children in a dream? The Founding Children wished for safety for all animals. All animals. Even the ones in the WILD. When we built Sanctuary City, everyone left outside the walls had to fight Extinction alone. We cut ourselves off and forgot about them. Kerry, that's in the past. How is that going to help us now? Yarra said to us, the only way Extinction can be defeated is if we work together. I understand what he meant now. Not just us, but everyone together! Citizens and the WILD. That change starts now. Huh? What? Huh! Kerry, come on! Run! What are you doing? I'm sorry. How did you do that? Kerry! Are you okay? Huh! Wake up! Wake up! - What's going on? - Wow! I can't believe that actually worked! What do you mean? You didn't know that was going to work? Nope! But now I know what I have to wish for. Uh, Kerry? What's wrong with your backpack? Uh, what? I told you to leave him behind! But... he's my friend! You said friends never have to face the world alone. You're seriously using that on me? Mm-hmm! Can we keep him? Please? Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. - Please! - Ugh, okay, okay. Ugh! Fine. Yeah! Woo-hoo! Okay. Ooh! We're here! We're finally here! It's the Sister Wishmas Tree! It's... dead. It can't be dead. It can't be! There must be a seed somewhere! No. No! Why? Where's the seed? All this way... for a dead tree! I did this. It's all my fault! No. What? Can't you see? It's dead! I can't believe I really thought I could fix this. No, Kerry. What are you no-ing me about? We're not giving up now! I was dragged on this adventure because of you. I nearly died on several occasions, because of you! And along the way, I learnt to believe in things I didn't think existed. Because of you! Wanna know what I wished for Wishmas this year? You don't even believe in Wishmas. That you'd get to go on a real adventure. Partly so I could take a break from you. But mostly 'cause I know how much you wanted it. And now, look at you! Out on this quest saving the world! Hmm. I promised you wouldn't have to face your problems alone. But now, I need your help. We all need your help. You're the one who just has to believe! Now, get up! Let's finish our adventure. I love you, Kerry. I love you, too. Petra! Look! Oh, whoa! - It's the seed! - It's the seed! It's alive! It's alive! Come on, little bud. You can do it. Come on! Whoo! Yeah! Grow, little seed! Grow! You can do it! You can do it! Come on! - Whoo! - Yes! Look! It's opening! Come on! Uh, this is not good. - Huh? - Huh? Yarra! You're alive! No, Bernard. No. This is Yarra. Our friend. Something's not right. What's going on, Yarra? No. No! Yarra! It's nearly ready. We have to keep him back! - Bernard! - Bernard! Bernard! Look out! No! Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry up, seed! Sorry, Yarra! Come on! Kerry. It's all up to you now. Make your wish when the seed is ready. Huh? Petra! Come on, Yarra! I know you're in there! Huh? It's ready! Do it, Kerry! I wish... I wish for the safety of all animals. Kerry! Huh? Kerry! Oh. Kerry, no! No, no, no. Please. Oh, Kerry. No. - Petra? - Kerry! Oh, Kerry! You did it! You defeated Extinction! Look! No, Petra. We did it. Yarra! Sorry, Kerry the Ringtail Possum. The power of Extinction was too great. Not as great as this! You did it! You really did it! Stick! Stick? No! Oh! Huh? Oh. Thank you. If I've learnt anything on this adventure, it's that family has to stick together. And I thought my jokes were bad. I'm proud of you. Both of you. But tell me, who is this little one? It's a long, long story. Lucky, it's a long, long trip home! Actually, could we make a few stops along the way? Whoo. Wow. What a beautiful city. It will be. Welcome home, everyone!
