It's gonna be a disaster If it ends up in criminals' hands. Wait a sec. I made quite an effort To get it from two workers. It can count as a service I rendered. Please let the superiors know. Ma Xianyong. I thank you on be half of our superiors. What? What happened? Ma, You're such a thug, aren't you? Are you jerking the captain around? It's a mistake! What? You really have a gun?

But don't be scared, We're using your place To stay away from troubles for a minute. You'll be fine If you cooperate well. But will you fire at me If I refuse to cooperate? You'll be dead once he fires. I won't cooperate then. Don't test my nerves. I've tolerated you for quite a long time. And there's a limit in my tolerance. Then fire at me. Do you want to try?

On credit again? Have you considered my proposal? My cousin I mentioned before? I'm not considering your cousin, I'll consider you instead. Don't make fun of me. Cut the crap. The enrolment for Senior 1 is about to finish, The payment can not be delayed. Yes, yes, I came here exactly for this issue today. Take a look at the fees for tuition and accommodation. Accommodation? Why is there an accommodation fee? Yiyi applied for school housing. She said she's discussed it with you. Don't you know that? One thousand eight hundred and fifty? We always charge by standards, If you have any doubt, You can look up the rates on our website. Not at all. I have absolutely no doubt about the school. That's good. Ms. Wu. Look, My budget is a bit tight recently. I just bought a flat. So you have money for a flat but not for the tuition fee? I'll write you an IOU. I don't want your IOU. We need the tuition fee. You gotta trust me. It has nothing to do with trust. Our school's gonna shut down, If all parents are like you. The tuition fee Will definitely be paid, If she studies well. What do you mean? So, You won't pay if she doesn't study well? That's not what I mean! What do you mean then? What do you mean? Ms. Wu, please. No, no, no. Please take them. I can't! Ah! They fell off. They fell off. Too bad. What happened? Yiyi. What did he do to you? Come here! Why did you run away? Come here! That's what you get, When you run away. Uncle Ma, please do me a favour. Get lost! Run! Run! Run! Ma Xianyong! You bloody security guard! Who stuck this ticket? I'm a cop. I'm on duty here. Whoever did it, Don't let me find out, Or I'll beat your leg off! I issued the ticket. Get off, you! The details of the crime scene are not yet clear. The police force has arrived at the scene To start investigation. The surrounding roads are temporarily closed. Our reporters are on their way. As the investigation goes on, Further reports will be followed by our channel. There have been witnesses of the incident Approving that the robbers had a gun. We have to remind our listeners, To pay attention to your safety, And report any suspicious personnel to the police. What the… Huang, How exactly is that Ma Related to our captain? That Ma Xianyong Was quite a good guy before. He just had a bad luck. When our captain Just graduated from the police academy, He was assigned to our station With an auxiliary police officer. That was him. Ma worked very hard and was brave as a lion. He also helped the captain solving some cases. But unfortunately he wasn't well educated, He tried the civil service test For over four or five years. When he finally passed the test, Ma got himself dead drunk At our captain's wedding. But you know what, He insisted on driving after drinking so much. The car crashed just over the crossing, His wife passed away Before the ambulance arrived. Why are there people taking cash out? Of course, it's a bank. Deposit only, no withdrawal? You have to keep the scene intact. The scene is ruined with people walking around. It was the phone store next door got robbed, not here. The phone store? They robbed a phone store with a gun? That's how I say they're retarded. You said the robbers were holding a gun? Have you seen how the gun looked like? Of course I have. I just came out, And that idiot had his gun pointing at me. That scared shit out of me so I ran inside. But I thought that wasn't enough, So I came back to shut the gate. How did the gun looks like? Who are you? Who am I? Don't you know who I am? The gun, Was a bit long. About this long. Just like those shotguns for hunting you'd find in villages. A shotgun for hunting? Those two idiots fired a shot in the shop. They fired a shot? Yeah. What else? That's it. Think harder. Nothing else. What are you doing? What do you mean? What do YOU mean? Are you robbing me? Not at all. You aren't qualified as a security guard, You failed my test. Get him out. Go away. What are you doing here? I just wanna help. I know you wanna help, But you've gone too far. It's out of good intention. It's very kind of you. But we're in a mess here, Go back and guard your site. I'm not going. What next? I haven't had breakfast. Go ahead and have some. You've got so much pho. These are all leftovers. Fine with me. Don't waste it. Alright, go ahead. The helmet is quite posh. Search it. We've asked all the motorcycle dealers across the town, No trace's been found yet. I'm afraid it was bought online. Send the photos to the department of Internet security, And ask them to search online. Call every seller Who sells the same model. Yes, sir. Huang, What about the gun? Ballistic analysis is on the way, The bullet fragments That we took out from the ceiling Have been sent for analysis. The results are coming out soon. Other than that, The fingerprints on the hammer Will be sent to compare soon. Two robbers, One gun. Why have they only robbed the store but not the bank, If they have guts to fire a gunshot? Captain! We've found something. Captain, This guy's called Chen Bobo, Nickname's Bobby. He's the head waiter of Le Rêve Parisien. That's the helmet. Get him. Having a row again? Why didn't you take the milk inside? I'm coming in myself. Don't you ever get in here, you old bastard! Get the fuck outta here! If you dare to take one step inside I'll yell the shit out of you! You cocksucking, dirt-eating twat! You gonna rot in your tomb alone! Go home and wait for the maggots To eat you dirty scumbag alive! Why're you so mad? What made you so mad in the morning? It's my birthday. Fuck off! Stop. Where are you going? Madam, We're leaving. Goodbye. It's not a tourist sight. Dare you leave. I am leaving. Wanna fly over and bite me? You can try. And I'll shout once you take a step out. Don't go! Stuff the mouth of that crazy bitch. Stuff her mouth. I'll shout if you dare to come forward. I'm shouting, stop! Back off. Back off. One more step. OK stay there. Stand still. Scared? Aren't you mass killers? The deadliest ones? Can't deal with a cripple? Dumbasses. What do you want? We're just passing by. Just let us leave. We should stick to the principles. I've seen your faces. How can you get away Without getting rid of me? Shoot me dead then you can go. Are you ordering me? Are you my mom? How strange. I'm not shooting you dead. You're not going if you don't shoot me. Fine, I'm not going. We've got plenty of time. Sit down. Will you be back if you can't get enough money? I'll be back no matter what. Take care of the site for me. They dug this out today, From the site. I've tried it, It still works. You gonna use this To fight the debt collectors? How brave you are. Mr. Gao. Look, I've bought one of your flats, And I borrowed one hundred thousand for the down payment. Now the construction work's been shut down, Can you give me back my money? So you'll fire at me If I don't give you the money back? That's not what I meant. Mr. Gao. Gimme back the money, Please. Please. Ma Xianyong, If you shoot me, You'll never get a penny. Tonight at eight o'clock, Xishan Bridge, I'll hold a funeral for Gao Ming, The developer of La Lune Bleue. Welcome, everyone! Don't miss the spectacle! What's this game? Can't beat an old bag with three men? Bobby! Stop! Bobby, stop! Bobby! Stop! Xiangjie, watch out! Bobby, stop! Stop! What are you looking at? Wanna a lift? How much to Le Rêve Parisien? Twenty. Fifteen. Get in. What do you want? Untie me! I'm not you. Everyone in the town Knows that I, Gao Ming Ran away from my debts. I can't live with such a bad name. You can't live with it? Have you thought about how I'll live with it? Do you know how many were talking behind my back? They said I'm your mistress, I'm a bitch. I divorced for your sake, And dumped my wife and kid. Liar! Everyone's a liar! I had shit stifled my brain When I fell in love with you. What did you say? Say that again! Say that again! You poked my eye! You asked for it! You stay away from this. Let the adults solve their own issue. It's not an issue between adults. It's between men. Yiyi! Gao Xiang, We got you quite a lot followers now. We've gathered more than a hundred from everywhere. What's the mission? Tonight, We'll go meet Liu Wu. Is it because he's holding a funeral for your old man? I've told you many times, My dad will come back. He owes Liu Wu too much money, They'll definitely come to him. They might beat my dad to death. I'll screw up this funeral. Let's cut the bullshit, Do you have the courage? Xiang. Listen to me. Surely we can't win if we really gonna fight. We're rescuing my dad! It's not a matter of winning or loosing. I gotta fight them no matter what. I don't blame you, If you dare not to come. But if you're coming with me, We'll meet here tonight at seven. According to the eyewitnesses, The two robbers with helmets Stopped for a while in front of the bank, Before dashing into this phone store. I'm here with Ren, the vice-captain of the police squad. Good morning. Good morning. This case has attracted wide attention Could you brief us what's the situation in general? I knew this today was gonna come, But never expected it to be so soon. Big Head, We're famous now. The two robbers were armed, They're very dangerous. How come are we famous? Nobody's gonna recognise us with helmets on. You dumb idiot. Big shots don't expose their faces easily. Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man, Eagle Man, They all wear masks. From now on in the underworld, Our gang will be known as The Helmetmen. The Helmetman. The phone-shop-robbing Helmetmen? You two dumbasses. Is she laughing at us? The firework parade at nine'o clock tonight... Just ignore her. What are you reading? Can you read all the characters? Ah, Water Margin. That's quite profound. It's a nice book since it has pinyin, Which can help you read. Bra, Lunch time. Alright. Bra? Why does he call you Bra? You're not wearing one. Why not Chicken-head? It fits your hairstyle. When we were kids, He killed a cobra all by himself. Everyone in the village thought he's so tough, We called him Cobra since then, And it gradually became Bra. Tough, huh? Why do you tell her that? Old stories should be left behind. Stop dredging them up. Don't talk to her. Fine. Do you want some food? I said don't talk to her! Fine. We're dining in her place. Thank you. Tell me, How much can we get when we sell off these phones? Can't tell yet, But a conservative estimate would be At least two hundred thousand. Two hundred thousand? If I get a half share, it makes a hundred thousand. Eighty thousand to redecorate the house; Twenty thousand for bride token. Or seventy thousand for redecoration; Twenty thousand for bride token; Ten thousand for lollipops. Xia loves lollipops. I've told you millions of times, She won't marry you. Let alone going back to the village with you. Why are you so sure? We didn't have money before, But now we do, That makes a difference. It's not about money, dude. Why did she come to the city? Why did we come to the city? Because we couldn't live in the village. Water streams downwards While men strive for somewhere higher. A city life is a different way of living, We'll have to fight for it. Our very first shot has been fired, Here's what we gonna do next. As soon as we manage to sell the goods, We'll use the money to upgrade our gears, Motorcycles, Helmets, Bullets, Guns. I'll get an AK for myself, And a rifle for you. We'll become bigger and stronger. Stand on the peak of success. Is sixty thousand enough for redecorating the house? Ambition, ambition! I know. Marrying Xia is my biggest ambition. Since you're robbers, Why didn't you rob the bank, but a phone store instead? It's easier to rob a phone store. There's no security guard. So you don't have the guts to rob banks. Admit it. No, we don't. Who said it? Of course we do, But it's not yet the right time. We're newcomers in this business, We need a solid start, And achieve higher step by step. Got it? Step by step. If I were you, I'll take robbery as the first step, And murder the second step. Why do you want us to kill you so badly? I want to die as much as you want to marry your girl; As much as you want to be the big brother. You guys can go out once you shoot me dead. Step by step, bigger and stronger. I'll tell you what, Killing me is like doing justice. It's not shameful to let people know you're helping people. I can give you all my money as well. It's kill two birds with one stone. Three birds! Does that make sense? Think about it. You can't go If you don't kill me. I'll shout if you try to leave, Then you'll have to stay here for longer. The three of us Will end up in this flat. We'll feed each other, While waiting for death. I'm already quite used to it, But you, curly hair, Don't you want to get married? You'll have to marry me instead. Chicken-head, Don't you want to be the big brother? The curly hair Will be your only gangman, I'll never obey your orders anyway. Never! What the... What the... Jesus... Not again! Stop it, Bra. Stop it, will ya? That's right. Shoot me dead. Everyone'll be happy. Hey, take a look! There's good saying on the wall. 'All the world's a stage' 'Men and women merely players' 'But if you're in rage' 'No one's happier than your haters' Understand? No rage! It makes sense. Every sentence makes sense. But it doesn't mean your logic's perfect. Will you never fall asleep? We'll go once she falls asleep. Big deal. I pissed my pants. Yes, yes. It's just a matter of time. No rage. Nap time. I'm really not the robber, sir! I've no idea where your gun is! Speak properly, will ya? Will ya? Will ya? Will ya speak properly? Will ya? Yes! Will ya? Yes! Yes, yes. I'm saying the absolute truth. They broke my arm, How could I be the robber? From now on, if you mistreat Zhenzhen, I'll beat you up every time I see you. Got it? Got it! Got what? When I see Zhenzhen, I'll call her my mom! They beat me up, And took my helmet too. Zhenzhen? Who's Zhenzhen? She's my mom. She's one of our massagists. Where can I find this Zhenzhen? Le Rêve Parisien! We do foot massage, oil massage and SPA, Prostate massage. Half price for all! I'll take you there, buddy! Hello, sir. Leniency to those who confess. What are you doing here? Answer it! That's how real cops interrogate people? Is that too rude? How then if that's wrong? If we are arrested, We'll offer a sincere confession. Cosplay Costs extra. Money's not a problem! Name? Wang Shuncai. Age? Fifty-six. You've committed illegal prostitution. There's a 'legal' prostitution then? Aren't you having sex when you both are naked? Nudity doesn't mean sex. I got into a wrong bathhouse, The woman saw me naked, Who is the prostitute in this case, The woman or me? Hello, sir. Daddy! What an eloquent lie! I'll tell you what, Even if the cops really get you, They'll escort you out themselves. Wait a sec! Are you a pervert, daddy? What're you doing here? Where? Here! Saving the planet. What? I'll tell you what, Your planet Has got a huge problem; The only way to save it Is to keep sleeping with men. You gotta be more serious. Fine. Let's go for a serious round. Name? Zhenzhen. How to spell? Z-H-E-N. Cop's here! Sir, it's a misunderstanding! We are saving the planet. I was doing regular massage, But he took my clothes off. What the hell! Sir, I… Ma? I'm sorry! What are you doing here! It's my birthday. It's my first time here. First time. Shut up. Get out. Yes, sir! I beg Jiaqi's pardon. Get lost! Alright. I'll wait for you outside. Who are you? Your two friends are in danger, They asked me to find you. Which friends? They just helped you beating up Bobby. They beat up Bobby, They got a gun, And robbed a phone store. Not only Bobby's looking for them now, But also the cops. I'm the only one who can help. How's that possible? Big Head is a coward How could he be a robber? Big Head has changed. Who are you? I'm part of their gang. What gang? I have no time to explain, Where are they? Manager, come here, This guy's weird! What are you doing? Manager! Don't do that! Don't yell! Gosh! Big Head really has a gun! The gun's mine! I'm not lying. I'm the only come who can help him. Police! Police! Fine. Let's wait. Keep waiting and you'll loose. I'm not afraid at all. Why will we loose? Nowadays every phone has a location tracker, Have you switched off all the phones you've robbed? Did you? Is every phone off? I'm afraid the cops are already at the corner of this building This one's off. This one's not! The second floor now. Switch that off! They'll knock the door. Be careful. You'll break them! That's not possible. They're all models. What are you doing? You two idiots! 'Step by step'! 'Bigger and stronger'! 'Men should have ambitions'! 'Ambitions'! Bra. Big Head. Helmetmen! I'm not laughing any more. What... What are you thinking? I want to watch TV. I'm thinking about death. Don't cram yourselves here, Move along. Move, move. Hands on the head. Get down. Get down. Get down. Who knows where Bobby is? Who knows where Bobby is? Dunno. Ma, I can be your witness. You have to know how to quibble In this situation. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Sir, Since you know each other so well, Please do us a favour. I'm not talking to you! Ma Xianyong, Have you lost your tongue? Forget it, captain. Go, go. Let me deal with this. Take a rest.

We're now brothers-in-arms, Once you're held in detention, I'll take good care of Jiaqi. Don't mention Jiaqi. If you dare to visit her again, I'll beat shit out of you. You heard that? But how about your sister's rent? You've already accepted my bride token. I borrowed it from you. Are you out of your mind? You said your sister needs a house to get married, That's why I gave it to you. Why the hell should I lend you all that, If your sister's not marrying me? Your sister's a cripple, A hundred thousand for bride token is already a lot! You played dead like a swindler this morning, And came here to hook up in the afternoon. Are you finding a hooker to be Yiyi's stepmother? Leave my case alone, I have clues about the robbery. Still fancy getting into auxiliary police unit? Forget about it! You're such a waste. Cuff him.

The sun sheds light on your face Pretty as you always be Your skin slipped in my body, which satisfied my desire The city is sort of complicated The passengers walk hastily Being alone, delicate, nervous is my routine, day after day You didin't say a word, face lowered You sank in deep depression You moved to chaos in abyssal sea You start to wait, aimlessly and hopelessly You didin't say a word, face lowered You sank in deep depression You moved to chaos in abyssal sea You start to wait, aimlessly and hopelessly Happiness lacks a little courage Romantic needs some poetry Silence in every second is a mystery We are sober and independent Even dreams didn't leave any trails Hey buddy, my mobile's in the room I gonna get it. Cut the crap. Hands up. Name? Zhenzhen. Real name? Zhao Hongxia. Place of origin? Liujizhai, Liangqiao Village, Xiangshui County. How long have you been in Qiaocheng? Five years. Occupation? Massagist at Le Rêve Parisien. Here are some photos. Please help us identifying them. These guys with helmets, Do you recognise them? Look closely. How can I recognise someone with a helmet?

I know You're hiding from me. I've sworn to my bro, That I'll forget you. I'll take all these years As a mere illusion. I'll be a dumbass if I ever look for you again. He said he doesn't deserve me. He thought I disliked him coz he can't make money. What does he know? He was just saying daft things. Big Head, Is your Xia pretty? Pretty. Very pretty.

You've forgotten it yourself, I reckon? Hu Guangsheng. You gonna push her off? You wanna help her committing suicide? She can't even move except her head, How can she commit suicide?

Not only her, I wanna change the flat too. To somewhere with a lift. You gonna sell your kidney for that? I gonna do something big. After this big thing I'm not myself no more. I'll let you see. Your brother Can do something other than bragging. What are you gonna do? I won't tell you. You gonna do what? Stop asking! I won't tell you. Bye-bye. Wait a sec! What?

Crying out You opened your eyes Laughing loud You marched forward But with confusion You then stranded In the silence Everything is disillusioned Seeking love's sliver line between ups and downs The edge of gray haze touched the blue sky Bursting like fireworks Burning Are those broken dreams still here To bring tomorrow with a future Since life is filled with resignation We should make it bloom in profusion This Angry and crazy cool little fish Persists and doesn't know how to retreat Fights against the wrong in his heart He refused to kneel, rather be smashed to pieces This humble but proud fish is of my own kind The halo of life sparks in his eyes He swears not to be encumbrance of our world Then what's the fear of break apart You look up To the freedom You let go To embrace it Seeking love's sliver line between ups and downs The edge of gray haze touched the blue sky Bursting like fireworks Burning Passing through this shadowy sea To bring tomorrow with gratification Wait silently in the dark Even the smallest dream shall blossom This Angry and crazy cool little fish Persists and doesn't know how to retreat Fights against the wrong in his heart He refused to kneel, rather be smashed to pieces This humble but proud fish is of my own kind The halo of life sparks in his eyes He swears not to be encumbrance of our world Then what's the fear of break apart
