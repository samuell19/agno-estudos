I'm going to Norfolk. Can you give me a ride? Sure. Get in. Thank you. Thanks. Had my thumb stuck out for an hour. And in this heat, not one son of bitch would stop. Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing? So, I'm a son of a bitch, am I? No. What does that have to do with it? I just said that you were... All right. Good job dancing, baby. Sorry, guy. Sorry. - Give me a rum and coke. - Okay. Hey, Mr. Ray-Ban. A bunch of us are going down to the beach for the Madonna concert. It's gonna start in a little while. You wanna come? Hey, so what do you say? Do you wanna come? Hey, who do you think you are, Mickey Rourke? Hey, Maggie, let him go. He looks like a fag to me anyways. Excuse me. Kevin, do you mind telling me what's going on here? It's a friend of mine. Kevin, this is bullshit. Look. Could we just talk? Well, you can even screw her if you want, okay? But just let me go. Hey, amigo. Too much of this and you're gonna be loco. Hey. You want a ride? Yeah. Can you take me to the first bus station? Sure. Hi. Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. So did you leave him? Who? The jerk you were with at the bar? That's none of your business. Okay. Okay, I'm sorry. So what's your name? Simon Boswell. Yeah, and I'm Sting. I'm joking. My name's Mark. What's yours? I'm Daniela. She's Daniela too. Daneska, that is. You look like her, you know? ls she your girlfriend? Are you nuts? Why? How old is she? She's 39. She doesn't look it, does she? Not at all. Daneska, that's a strange name. It's Russian. She lives in Moscow. So, who is she? A ballerina, a spy, or what? Stop it! ls something wrong? I don't like it when people say bad things about her. I love her. Do you understand? I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. You don't have to get mad. Hey, listen, thanks for the ride... Wait. Why do you wanna get out here? The bus station's still miles away. Let go of me. I wanna walk, okay? Oh, shit, my boyfriend's coming. Just pretend everything's normal. Okay? He's looking for me. If he sees me with another guy he's gonna make a big scene. I guess you saved yourself. I have quick reflexes. I thought you were the jealous one. I am, I guess. If you only knew. Come on. Let's have a drink. Have a glass of Coke. Thanks. Cold enough? Yeah, it doesn't even taste like Coke. It's not. Oh, sh, sh, sh. What did you do to me? Drug me? No, it was just a sleeping pill. Just calm down. Nothing's gonna happen to you. If you brought me in here to fuck me, you can just forget it. Now get these off me 'cause I wanna go. You can't force me to do anything. I want you to stay here with me. What are you crazy? Take these off or I'm gonna start screaming. You just try it. Help me! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! I'm not joking. Where are we? In a quiet place where no one will bother us. You know you're really cute when you scream. Drink this, it'll do you good. Come on. I swear, there's nothing to it. I don't feel like drinking and I don't like vodka. I don't like it either. But I can't live without it anymore. Listen, you've had your fun. Now cut it out, okay? Will you take these off? I have to go to the bathroom. Please, I can't hold it anymore. Leave the door open. And hurry. I can't. I'm embarrassed. Would you turn around, please? Don't move or I'll kill you. Throw me the key to the camper, quick. Now get outta my way. Don't be silly. That thing could go off. I said, "Move!" My god. Oh my god. Idiot! It was loaded with blanks. You think I'm that stupid? Huh? Now give me your goddamn arm. Come on. No. Help, please! Somebody, please open up! Help, please. Stop, stop! Hello? Pat, it's me. Daniela, what do you want at this hour? Please, Pat, let me talk, I'm in danger. I need a lotta help. In danger, what's happening? This guy, he kidnapped me. He's crazy. Please, do something. Call the police. I'll do it right now, but where are you? I don't know. He handcuffed me in a trailer. You shouldn't have done that. You shouldn't have. You're gonna pay for this. Please, let me go. You're a whore. You're like all the others. No. Please, let me go. You try that again, and I'm gonna cut your throat. Are you sure, Pat? Who would've kidnapped her? And Why? I don't know, I'm telling you. She didn't have time to tell me. Well listen, do you think it's a joke? No. I know my sister too well. She was terrified. She said something about a lunatic. Did you call the police? Yes, but they didn't believe me. They said hundreds of girls disappear every week after fighting with their boyfriends. Ah, idiots. I'm scared, Kevin. You have to find her before something happens to her. Nothing's going to happen. Just let me take care of it. Don't worry about it. Okay. Hey, dude. You still staying at that lousy campground? No. Listen, you guys haven't seen my girlfriend by chance, have you? What'd she dump you? Yesterday morning. Listen, I couldn't swear by it because I just took a hit of acid, but I think I saw her get in a camper at the campground entrance. A camper? I think so. Or maybe John Wayne's horse. You were wasted. Come on, stupid. Why are you mad at me, Daneska? You won't get upset if I call you Daneska, will you? Why are you keeping me here? You cannot keep me here. That's kidnapping. You're making a big mistake. Please let me go. You don't understand at all. I want you to stay with me. You don't like me, do you? Come on, admit it. You hate me. No. I don't hate you. I don't even know who you are. All I'm saying is that you have no right to keep me here. Do you wanna go back to Kevin? How did you know his name was Kevin? I was watching you at the campground. I overheard his name. Whose camper's this? Mine. My father gave it to me. But enough questions, you have to eat. Come on. I'm not hungry and I don't feel like eating. Eat anyway. You fuckin‘ idiot. Stop it! You bastard. You can't keep me here. Stop it! Stop it! Let me go. Let me go. You bastard. Son of a bitch. You can't keep me here. You, you're crazy. You're gonna learn to like it here, or I'm gonna kill you. Do you understand? You son of a bitch. Help! Hi. What're you doing here? Uh, nothing. I drove all night and I was laying down. Who hurt your shoulder? Oh, I uh, I scratched myself cleaning my spear gun. Driver's license, please. Yeah, it's around front. Here you go. This. You traveling with someone? No. By myself. Gazer. Mark Gazer. As in the Glazer Hotels? My father. Hey, your dad's got his act together. I saw him on TV once. He must manage more money than Daddy Warbucks. I guess that makes me Little Orphan Annie. Well listen, Annie, you can't park on this beach on holidays. So get your ass in gear and get outta here. Okay. Hey, John. Your left taillight is broken. Get it fixed soon unless you wanna pay a big fine. Okay. I'll have it checked. I'll have it fixed at the next service station. Thanks. Come on. Daniela. Can you hear me? Oh, Christ. - What're you doin‘, man? - I was just looking, man. You smell like a thief from a mile off. Who you trying to kid? Give me a chance to explain. I don't need no explanations from you, man. You motherfuckin‘ son of a bitch! I'll teach you to fuck with me, you motherfucker, you. I'll kill your fuckin‘ ass. You son of a bitch. I'm thirsty. Come on, drink. Do you want some more? No. My hair? Oh my god. What did you do to me? Why? You're much more beautiful this way. You look just like Daneska. Aren't you happy? I feel a little bit dizzy. Do you think maybe I could have some of that vodka? Do you really want it? Yes I do. I didn't know vodka was so strong. Do you really like me like this? Yes, very much. Who's Daneska? Don't you trust me? I can keep a secret, you know. Come on, who is she? Do you really wanna know? Yes. She's my mother. Your mother? She's so young. She's only 18 years older than me. She left when I was 10. She went back to Russia. But I love her. I loved her a lot more than my father did, you know? Now what? I don't know. I really don't know. Sometimes I think I, I, I hate her. I think of her all the time. Let's not talk about it anymore. Drink your vodka. Do you wanna make love to me, Mark? Why don't you kiss me? Come on, kiss me again. I'm sorry. It's always like this. I'm not any good. I'm nothing. Come on, admit it. I'm not worth shit. It's not your fault. It can happen to anyone. It's you. It's your fault. Stop, stop, you're hurting. Stop, stop, you're hurting me. Stop. - You are a whore. Do you hear me? You're a whore. How can I make love to you? It's as though you are her, huh? I'll never be able to, never! Shit. It's over. Not yet, Pat, but I'm on the right track. Listen, do you know if any of her friends in Florida have a camper? A camper? No, I don't think so. Why do you ask? I'll tell you later. I have to go. Oh dear god, when I think that Daniela might be in the hands of some monster. You shouldn't think about it, Pat. I promise you I'll get her out of this. It's just a matter of time. Let me know what's happening or I'll go crazy. Okay. I'll call you as soon as I know something. That'll be $10, man. Listen, have you seen a camper with a girl in a blue and white t-shirt in it? No. Can't say that I have. Hey, just a minute. Now that I think about it, I did see a camper yesterday morning. It came out of the rest stop over there and then it turned off into the highway. But uh, that was a boy, alone inside. What did he look like? Oh, he was about 20, I guess. He had on those mirrored sunglasses. Hi. How's it goin‘? I don't feel good. I'm dizzy. I don't remember anything. How long did I sleep? For a while. But everything's gonna be okay now. Don't you worry about it. Are you mad at me? No. I have a surprise for you. Do you know what day it is today? It's my birthday. I'd really like to take you out to a nice restaurant, dancing even. Yeah, let's go out. Do you wanna go out, please? You know perfectly well that's not possible. You'd try to leave me. And I couldn't take that. But... Champagne too. What do you think? Listen, let's make a deal. You take the handcuffs off and I'll accept your invitation. We'll celebrate here, just the two of us. And I won't try to escape. I promise. And in exchange? And in exchange, you let me go tomorrow morning. I'll never see you again. Why not? I'll leave my phone number. We can see each other whenever we want. You have my word on it. Okay? Okay. I'll do it. Everything's spinning. You'll be okay. Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. Wait. Turn around. What is this, a joke? No. Just turn around for one minute. Okay. You can turn around now. Geez. That's beautiful. Must've cost a fortune. Doesn't matter. Try it on. Well, I should take a shower first. You can close the door if you want. How do I look? You're beautiful. Thank you, Mark. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday dear Mark ♪ Happy birthday to you Yay! Did you make a wish? Wait, the champagne. Woo! Whoa, baby! For good luck. I wish you a hundred more days like this. Together, with you. Should I put a record on? No, I don't feel like it. I'd rather talk. Me too. We have to get to know each other better. Okay, I'll start. What do you wanna know? Everything. All right, well, my name is Daniela Foster and I'm 19. And I was born in Seattle, Washington, but I live in Tampa with my big sister, Pat. Um, I played volleyball in school. And, what else? I like rock music. That's it, I guess. Did you have other guys before him? Well, yeah, but nothing serious. How many? What a silly question. Two, three, I don't remember. Did you go to bed with him? With who? With that son of a bitch? We haven't had any cake yet. Mm, mm. Mm, fantastic. Chocolate's my favorite. How'd you guess? Did you go to bed with him? Yes, I did. But why do we have to talk about it? Your father must be very rich to buy you a camper like this. Well, I don't even know anything about you. Not even your last name. I wish I didn't have a last name. I wish I was just Mark, period. Why? Don't you have a good relationship with your father? I hardly ever see him and we rarely speak. He's always at the office. Until three years ago, I was away at school in Boston. Since your mother left? Come on. Let's have another toast. No, the party's over. Go to sleep. Go to sleep, now. Get up. Mark, are you asleep? Mark? Are you sleeping? Oh my god. What time is it? It's almost 10. Put that backpack down. Why? Don't you remember your promise? Yes. So, open the door. Open it. No. You can't keep me here. Now let me go. So you can run and turn me into the police? Do you think I'm that stupid? Do you think I don't know you tried to sneak out of here last night? Did you find the pictures in the drawer? You ugly shit. You tricked me. You tricked me. You had no intention of keeping your word. You're a snake. You make me sick. I hate you, I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Stop whimpering, slut. You hear me? I can't stand this anymore. I hate you, I hate you. - Slut! - No! I'm not gonna let that bastard fuck you ever again. - No! You understand? Now hold out your arms quick, or I'm gonna stick you. Stop! Stop it. You son of a bitch. Oh, god. You're hurting me, stop. Let me go. Help me! Somebody help me! Shut up! Stop. You be good while I'm gone. Son of a bitch. And don't fuck anything up. You son of a bitch. Go to hell! Stupid! You broke the fan belt when you tried to get away last night. It needs to be replaced. I'll be back in an hour. So? I'm sorry son, but uh, we haven't rented out any campers like you've uh, described before. I mean, not in the last few months. Uh, I mean, let me tell you something, there isn't a great demand for uh, Chieftain 88s. Okay. Are you uh, trying to find one? Yes, uh. A friend of mine, a guy who drives that wears mirrored sunglasses, drives a white and beige like this. What can I do? You uh, have a license plate number? Unfortunately not. So I'll tell you what you do. It would be easier to predict the winner at the dog races tonight. Okay. Thanks. Good luck. Hey. ls anyone there? I have the feeling I've seen you someplace before. Are you from Virginia Beach? No. Strange. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's I never forget a face. Mind if I change the program? Another news flash. In a swamp north of Charleston, police yesterday found the remains of a body that had been torn apart by alligators. Identification of the body is difficult, but initial examination seems to indicate that it is a young white girl between 20 and 30 years old. The county coroner-- - Sorry. Has ordered... Bloody stories frighten me. Yeah, me too. But I think someone must've killed her, and then plop, he threw her into the swamp. Over here. You can drop me off over here. Have a good trip. All right, let's bring out Jennifer. She's. All right. Look at that. Show off in her tank guard. Yes. All right. Oh, my goodness. Yes, fabulous. Thank you, Jennifer. All right, let's bring up the next gorgeous Hey, hey. Go ahead. All right. Look at that. Great job. Okay, show your stuff off. Come on, let's give 'em another one. Motherfuckers, here we go. Oh, yes. Ah. Ain't that great? Ain't that great? That's fabulous. There you are. Oh my gosh, look at this. Okay, and show them what you got there. Okay. Ah, Annie, she's fabulous. Oh, thank you, Annie. Oh, yes. Oh my god. Be careful. This is a family place right here. This is a family place. Kimberly, you're wild. Okay, I'm telling you. Show and tell, Bambi. Show and tell, baby. Hey man, will you give me $20 for this? It's a brand new Crown with auto reverse. No, I don't think so. Look, you sure man? Yeah. Hey, check this out. It's a new Crown. Say, 20 bucks? You wanna buy it? Yes, there she is, Jennifer. Let's bring out Kimberly. - So, you wanna buy it? No, man. Tell me where you stole it, you shit, or I'll break your neck. - Take your hands off me. Tell me where you stole it, you son of a bitch. What? It's mine. Show 'em what you got. All right. These are yours too. Just tell me where you stole 'em. Okay. From a camper near the woods. There it is. That's it. Are you happy? Yeah, thanks. I'm going. Daniela. Daniela. Oh my god. Kevin. I thought you'd never come. Who, who was it? Why'd they do this to you? Hurry. He's crazy. Get this stuff off. We gotta go. He's gonna kill us both. Ouch. Hurry. Pull hard. Can you make it? Come on, hurry. Come on, we've gotta hurry. Kevin. Come on. Let's go. Come on. No! Stop, or I'll shoot. And this one isn't loaded with blanks. It shoots real nine millimeter bullets. No, please. Take a step, or scream, I'm gonna put a hole in her the size of a half dollar. Now quick, get in the camper. I said, move. Now! You ﬁrst. Kevin? You bastard. Kevin. Now get in. You're together again. Are you happy? No, please. Kevin! You can yell if you want. Nobody can hear you. What's the matter, Daneska? Are you worried about your little friend? Huh? Why are you torturing him? He had nothing to do with this. Oh, that's it, isn't it? You little whore. You're afraid he won't be able to fuck you again, right? Leave her alone! You little pig. Let me show you what happens to a bastard like him. There isn't enough room in this camper for three. One of us has to go. No, please, I beg you. Don't do it. Are you afraid? Go ahead. Beg my forgiveness. Beg, goddammit. No, Kevin! No shell. Shut up! Did you like my little joke? Huh? Come on, speak. Didn't you think that was funny? You wanna take Daneska away from me, don't you? Huh? You wanna keep amusing yourself with her? To make her wiggle her ass in the campground, like a whore? Isn't that right? Answer me, bastard. You're crazy. Why do you wanna keep provoking me? Huh? No. Stop. Please, stop it! Did you see? You frightened Daneska, you fuck. I'm doing it all for her. What happened? What happened? Did you hurt yourself? You wanna ﬂy? You wanna ﬂy? Fly away. Kevin? Feeling better? Take it easy. Water. Water, I'm burning up. I see you're thirsty. Yes. Please give him something to drink. What did you put in there? Just a little vodka. I thought I'd give him his strength back. Hm? No, please don't. It bothers you when I touch you, doesn't it? Come on, give me a kiss. Come on. Kiss me. Relax. Enjoy yourself. Let yourself go. I can't. Leave me alone. Why? Does it bother you that he's watching? I'll take care of that. Huh? You can listen if you want. Now, where were we? Think we were right around here somewhere. Hm? Huh? Huh? Right around? I love you, Daniela. I love you too, Kevin. You bitch! Stop! Stop, I'll stay with you. I'll do anything. It's too late. I don't give a damn about your promises anymore. Well done. You're right to love her. Seeing that she's been fucked by a whole bunch of people. Even by a nigger. That's right, she told me so. She even gave herself to me. She picked me up. Why? Why are you doing this? Because you're a trader. You're a worm. Just like that fuckin‘ tennis pro who ran away with my mother. I was 10 years old when he took Daneska away from me. But you can bet that I'm not gonna let that happen again. I'm not gonna let you take Daneska away from me. Watch this. Enjoy the view. 'Cause I'm gonna stick it between her legs and make her scream like a pig. - No. - Let her go, you son of a bitch. No. You shouldn't have said that. You shouldn't have insulted my mother. Go ahead. What are you waiting for? No. I want your whore to see you suffer. To cry, to beg for mercy. I want her to see you grovel. Here, take a good look. You're not gonna be able to enjoy his disgusting macho. No. Kevin, watch out! No! No! No! No, Kevin! No! No, Kevin! No! You son of a bitch, you murdered him! You murderer. Let me go. You murderer, you son of a bitch. Kevin! You son of a bitch. Kevin. Well, you gonna open up or not? You can't stay here. The program finished a long time ago. What you been up to in there? Nothing. Nothing. I was just sleeping is all. Okay. But you better get going. You're gonna be in a lot of trouble if the guard catches you. Sorry. I'm going. Okay. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Excuse me, but what's going on? Haven't you been listening to the radio? No. They robbed a bank about an hour ago. The thieves managed to escape, but one of 'em was wounded. They're checking all the cars. See your driver's license, registration, please. Hold it. Where you heading to? Norfolk. Okay, sarge. I'll tell the other boys right away. Over and out. Hey, Sam. Yeah? They just picked 'em up on Highway 95. - That's great. - You can head on out now. All right. Okay. Daniela, you awake? Daniela, wake up. Daniela. Wake up. Daniela. Well. Well you wanted to run away with that bastard? Congratulations. You've done it. Here are the reports you wanted on the suburban offices, Mr. Glazer. Good. Palm beach has performed well this quarter. Yes, it's made a strong recovery. Thanks, Miss Baker. Um, did you remember to book a table at the Oyster Inn for tonight? I'm having dinner with my son. Oh, yes, sir. Thank you. So Mark, did you enjoy your time with the camper? Yes, Dad. I had an okay time. There was a significant rise in share prices on Wall Street yesterday, due to re-evaluation in interest rates. The dollar gained against again the yen, the mark, and pound. And then what are you planning to do? Well, I thought I'd stay here with you for the time being. Maybe give you a game or two of golf. For how long? I thought maybe a week. Or maybe two. - And then? - We interrupt our financial report to bring you news of a reported finding this morning in an abandoned junk yard on the outskirts of Virginia Beach. Police have recovered the body of a young man who is said to be in his 20s, who was stabbed to death. The body had been welded into the back of an old Studebaker. We have no further details at the moment, but the police investigation... What's wrong? Do you feel all right? Yes. Why? You didn't answer my question? What are you planning to do afterwards? Oh, yeah. Um. Well, I thought I'd take the camper back down the coast. I'm goin‘ to Norfolk, okay? Yeah. Hey bro, what's happening? Hey, why don't we share her? Hey, pull over. We wanna she that blonde's cute little ass. Hey, why don't we share her? Hey, pull over. We wanna see that blonde's cute little ass. Go to hell! You're a sneaky bastard. You wanna fuck her all by yourself. Go to hell. You sons of bitches. You're a sneaky bastard. You wanna fuck her all by yourself. Bastards! There's nothing to worry about now. You want some Coke? Come on, you want some? No. I don't wanna sleep like the last time. Daniela? Yes, it's me. Then you're not dead after all. No. I was only pretending I was dead. But I really owe my life to the man who saved me in the junkyard. You were very, very lucky. And you're not, Mark. No one's gonna pull you out. No, Daniela, please. Don't do this. Have mercy. No. You didn't have any mercy on me.
