Good morning, mom. Hi honey. Good morning. Are the girls up? I heard them moving around. I think I'm gonna be home on Friday. Okay, we'll hold down the fort until then. Smells good. Hi, pops. Pops? Hey. Hi, mom. Breakfast is almost ready in about five seconds. You look nice, sweetie. Oh, this old thing? Oh, uh... The no-carb diet, that's right. Yeah. Problem solved. Morning, pops. What is this pops business? We thought you needed a nickname. It makes me sound old. Dad, you are old. I agree with them. Don't you even say it. What? That better not be a boy. No, it's Leslie. We're working tonight. Are you working late? Yeah, we have a big bio test to study for after our shift. I might stay over if that's okay? Yeah, that's okay. Just make sure you text me if you're going to. I have to go, honey. Bye, I'll see you Friday. Bye dad, have a good trip. You ladies be good for your mom. Bye dad. Oh! We actually gotta go. Yeah, I have gym first period. Hey wait a minute, lunches, lunches! Thanks! Okay. Drive safe Rachel, don't speed! You're welcome. And those are... Eighty-five dollars. Just get lost, okay? All right, there you go. Have a good day. You too. Hey. Was that Aaron? Yeah, what a creep. Anyways, you ready to close? Are you kidding? I'm not on commission. Let's get out of here. Go grab your stuff, I'll get the lights. Hi there, you've reached Rachel Kent. Thanks for calling, but you do know there's this thing called texting, right? Hey, did Rachel text you last night? No. I know she has that big test today. Yeah, I know. Hi there, you've reached Rachel Kent. Thanks for calling, but you do know there's this thing called texting, right? Hey Rach. I didn't hear from you last night. It's totally fine if you need to study with Leslie, but you said that you were gonna text me and I haven't heard from you. So give me a call, okay? Love you, bye. I'll get it! Hey. Dad! Hi! Morning sweetheart. When are you coming home? Just a couple more days. But hey, I was thinking when I get back, maybe we can talk about getting that puppy. Are you serious? Honey, how's St. Louis? Ugh, horrible. There are definitely no puppies here at all. Hey hon, did Rachel ever text you this morning? No, why? She spent the night at Leslie's and I never got a text from her. Well, she had that big chemistry test or whatever. Biology, yeah. I'm sure she's fine. I think she's just trying to find a new routine. It's gonna be confusing, I think for all of us. Okay, well hon, we're about to pull up to school, so we're gonna have to say goodbye now. I love you both. Bye! Bye, mom! Angel? Yeah? Would you do me a favor and give this to Rach if you see her? Mom, middle school kids don't really hang out with the older-- I know, but would you please? If you see her. Okay, sure. But if you really want to get a hold of her, you could just... What? Well, you did give Rachel a phone, so you could just use the find my phone app. That's brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? Yeah, okay. Just promise you'll forget it once I'm 16. Of course... I won't. Hey... I want that puppy! Umm, hi. It's Rachel's mom. I just want to-- Rachel! Rachel! Rachel... Mom... I'm here. I'm here, okay? I'm here. Leslie... Mrs. Kent? I'm detective Pam Cherfils. Oh, hi. You must be exhausted. Kind of, yeah. Please, let me get you a coffee. Okay. And she often works late? Yeah, she works after school, 5 to 9. She said she was going to spend the night at a friend's house after studying. How did I let this happen? You did good finding her so quickly. And what about your husband? Did he know Rachel was spending the night? Uh, Greg's in St. Louis. He's a trial lawyer, it's a lot of travel. Was it common for your daughter to stay over at the Miles' home? No, not really. But nothing is really common for us. What do you mean? Rachel's only lived with us for three months, so we don't exactly have a routine yet. So Rachel is-- Rachel's my stepdaughter. How did Rachel come to live with you? Greg and Martha, Rachel's biological mother, had a terrible breakup. Greg lost custody. He's very upset about it, he doesn't like to talk about it. So we only saw Rachel three or four times maybe. Then about a year ago, Martha calls Greg. Apparently battling some sort of drug addiction and asked for help. We assumed that it was a play for more money. That's not uncommon. And then a few months later, social services calls. Martha's gone. No note, no explanation, nothing. She packed a bag while Rachel was at school, and never came home. Can you imagine? That's horrible. We agreed to take custody of course. And then this happens. We were just getting back to some sort of normal. Poor girl. God, it's so unfair. So you were closing up and getting ready to leave. And this was at 9pm? It might've been more like 8:45. Sometimes we would close up early so we can get a head start on homework. But only if there was no customers there. You're not gonna tell Cheryl, are you? She's the manager of the store. No, I won't tell her. So, you close early to go do homework? Yeah, Leslie always helped me with my homework. She was so smart. It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. I'm sure she was a good friend. She was the best. Rachel, can you tell me what happened to her? So, I went into the back room to try and find my phone... Hey Leslie, have you seen my phone? One of them... he was holding Leslie by the throat. Then the other guy, he grabbed and slammed me on the ground and he started choking me. Was he wearing gloves? What? The assailant. Was he wearing gloves? Uh, yeah. Yeah, he was. I remember the smell of leather. And what about the second attacker? Was he also wearing gloves? Yeah, but his were different. His were like big, bulky ski gloves. And then... Leslie, she tried to save me and she jumped on the back of my attacker. Then the other guy, he hit her so hard. She just dropped. Then the first guy came back and he started choking me again, and then... I kept thinking this is what it must've been like for Martha. Your mother? Yeah. She said the drugs were like someone choking her, like you couldn't breathe without them. And that's when you passed out? Yeah. Next thing I remember, I woke up. Tied up in the back office. She was just lying there. I had to stare at her for hours and there was nothing I could do to help her. Okay, that's enough for today. Of course... thank you. I just want you both to know that I'm going to do everything in my power to find the men who did this. Thank you, detective. Hey, come on, can we get some space here? Come on, back up! How are you feeling? Please! Back up, please. How did you manage to survive? Can you describe the experience, please? Guys? Guys, please give us our privacy right now, okay? Thank you. We just have one question! How are you feeling, honey? I don't know... that was crazy. People just want you to know they're with you. They love you, just like us. Sis! Hi! Oh, it feels so good to be home. Did you miss me? Mmm-hmm! I wasn't there... Honey, this isn't your fault. I've never been there. No... Not once in 12 years. You lost custody. There was nothing you could do. I could have fought harder. I should have. She's my daughter and I just... let her go. Then I finally get a chance to do my job and she gets-- You're here for her now. We both are. I'm just so sorry. Leslie was my best friend. My only friend. I'm just-- I'm just so sorry. It should've been me. I miss her so much. Rach? Can I come in? Yeah, sorry. I just couldn't sleep, you know? I understand. You of all people did not deserve this. This feeling, does it ever go away? Yes. I just feel so alone. You're not alone. Never again. You're part of this family, like I am. Like Addy or like your dad is. We're gonna work through this, but together. Okay? You promise? I promise. Thanks, mom. Outside the Kent home, where the family will give a statement on the attack of Rachel Kent and the murder of Leslie Miles. The girls were attacked while the-- Here they come! Rachel, did you recognize your attackers? Do the police have any suspects? Look, we just want to put this terrible tragedy behind us. Now my daughter would like to say a few words. She won't be taking any questions. I'm... I'm just so sorry. Leslie was my best friend, my only friend. It should've been me. I just miss her so much. Come on. Mr. Kent, one more question! Okay bye, girls. Your mom will be here to pick you up. Bye! Bye guys. Have a good day. I hope we're doing the right thing. She wants to move on, that's a good thing. What's wrong? I don't know. Something about her in front of all those cameras. All that attention. She's been through the ringer. But everyone's being so supportive. Maybe some positive attention is exactly what she needs. Maybe you're right. It was so scary... Hey Addy! Come and join us for a second. She'll tell you all about it. It was so crazy. I was just telling them about this morning. How many news stations do you think were there? Umm, all of them I think. That's crazy. So like, did they ask you any questions? Yeah, they asked me what it was like being attacked and how I survived. Were you scared? Well yeah, I was face to face with death. But, I had a family to come home to. Somehow, I knew I was gonna be all right. Hey, how's it going in there? Well it's math, so not great. If you need help, let me know. It's fine, Rachel's helping me with it. Did you see her at school today? Sure. Did she seem okay? I think she was fine. She's like a total celebrity now. What do you mean? Well, everybody wanted to hear about what happened. Did she mind talking about it? I don't think so. Actually, she really got into it. She even invited me to hang out with the seniors and talk about the press thingy this morning. It was really cool. Reporting live for CH News in Oregon. Outside the Kent home, where the family will give-- Special delivery! Mmm those smell good. Thank you! I thought you girls were doing homework? We are. I just wanted to see if there was any updates. Okay, after homework. My daughter would like to say a few words. She won't be taking any questions. I'm just so sorry... Do you think I look pretty? Of course you do. Deiverls. Pam, please. I'm sorry to show up like this. No, it's alright. How can I help? I was hoping that I could speak with Rachel again. I'd like to go over her statement in a bit more detail. I'd rather you didn't. She's been through that night multiple times. I know-- We'd really like to move past this. I understand, really. But Leslie's mom deserves to move on too. Poor Tess. She lives just down street. I just came from there. She's really struggling. It would help if we could catch who did this. Yeah. Thank you. Then it all went black. The next thing I remember, I was waking up in that back office. But they hit Leslie first, right? They hit her and then the second man started choking you. Yeah, I saw her fall and-- and then he started choking me. It was so hard to breathe. Oh god I m sorry, it s all just such a blur. Okay, it's okay. I think that's enough. Is that enough? Just a few more questions, please. The man who hit Leslie. You said he was maybe six feet tall. Could you see any discerning marks, maybe a scar? No. Or a tattoo? No. Any kind of mark that would help us identify him? No, I told you! He was tall, he wore leather gloves, and he killed my best friend! What more do you want? I think that's enough. I thought the man who choked you was wearing leather gloves and Leslie's attacker was wearing the ski gloves? Yeah, no, that's right. Okay, which man wore the leather gloves? The man who choked me! I just said-- What's going on here? Mr. Kent, I was just asking Rachel some follow up questions. It sounds like a damn interrogation to me. I'm sorry, that wa mte. Honey, you don't have to say another word. And you... you can show yourself out. I'm sorry, thank you for your time. Thank you, detective. Greg, that was uncalled for. She's just trying to do her job. You have no idea what kind of bull the cops could pull on these kinds of-- Bob? Yeah, it s Greg. I m gonna need some counsel... You did great. Why did you do that? Why did I do what? Make me talk to that woman. Why did you do that? I understand it's really hard right now. But if you try, you might remember some small things that'll help the police catch who did this. No, you stupid bitch! You never should've let me say anything! Lieutenant? Yeah, what's up? There is an incident report here from 18 months ago. Leslie Miles pressed charges against someone she claimed was stalking her. Why don't we know this already? The stalker was a minor at the time. Everything's been expunged. Can I use your phone? Yeah. Yeah hi. No, it's Lieutenant Smith. I need you to put me through to the DA's office, please. Yeah, thank you. We'll get a court order to open this thing right away. Yeah. Good work. You weren't there. You didn't see how she acted. She was in a tough position. Are you saying it was my fault? It's unfortunate. Rachel really shouldn't be talking to the police without us discussing it. Okay I admit, the questioning went on longer than I expected. But the detective was just doing her job. Cindy, I'm telling you this is how it happens. The police can't solve a case, so they start throwing the blame on the victim. Greg! She wasn't herself. She was angry! Violently angry. She was lashing out. She's been through a traumatic experience and now there's a police woman that's trying to blow holes in her story. It's not just this, it's her behavior at school. Addy said she has an entourage now. She's walking around school telling everybody about the murder. So? So she's acting like a celebrity. She's a teenager. There's no right way to deal with something like this. Okay well, I think we should get her help. No. Greg, you said it yourself. She's been through a traumatic experience. First with her mom, and now this. No. Greg, she needs a professional who can help her with these issues. Rachel is going to be fine. She needs her family right now, not a shrink. Hey! Good news. Oh yeah? What is it? Claret County just picked up our stalker. 19 year old male named Aaron Barker. And guess what? He had ski gloves in the trunk of his car. Come on, let's go! Okay! Things aren't looking good for you, Aaron. I wasn't there, okay? I swear! I left. I left and I went home. And only your mother can vouch for you, is that right? Does she know about your restraining order? I got nothing else to say. Well, guess we'll see about that. Maybe when we find your partner, he'll be more talkative, huh? Mom as an alibi. We're so close. He was in the store that day. We know that for sure. He's just not what I expected. They never are. I don't know. It's just-- No prints, no DNA, avoiding the cameras. It was so careful. He knew the girl, he knew the place, he knew the lay out. It makes sense. Yeah, but the crime is the opposite. Using the register as a weapon. It just-- it feels so spur of the moment. Maybe him and his buddy went in there expecting to confront Leslie. He didn't realize she has a friend with her, panicked, attacked them both. Then used the robbery as a cover. Yeah, but-- But what? The physical evidence at the scene isn't corresponding with the statement from the victim. The M.E. said that Leslie was hit from the front, not from behind like the Kent girl s statement. Yeah well, sometimes victim s statements can be confused, especially when they're young. I know but when I re-interviewed Rachel, her story was all over the map. And there's something else. Rachel's injuries are basically superficial, cuts and bruises. Any of it could have been self-inflicted. What about the choking? Look at the bruise pattern. When you choke someone, your thumbs line up next to each other. When you choke yourself your thumbs are apart, and your hands cross over. And her bruise pattern is reflective of self-asphyxiation. So you're telling me that this little thing killed her best friend, then tied herself up, lay on the floor all night waiting for someone to open that door and find her? Nah. My money s on the stalker. But if his alibi holds up... Keep pushing this victim killer angle, just in case. But you t tread care. Because if you're wrong, Rachel's the victim. Oh it's gonna fall! It's gonna fall! I'm so stuck. A puppy! Oh my god. Happy Saturday. Where did he come from? What's his name? His name is Ted. And he's a rescue. He's been through a whole lot. He just needs a lot of love now. Can we take him out to play? I'm sure your mom would love that, as long as you take him outside. Come on Ted, let's go outside! Good one, honey. Oh, he's going to tear up the house. I'm sorry about last night. I messed up. There's a stigma that starts when you see a psychiatrist and I just-- I don't want that for Rachel. I understand. Thank you. Everything's going to be alright. I know. You're gonna help with the dog, right? Right? Yes, yes. Hi, Tess. Hi. Can I come in? I'll get a bowl of water for your dog. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? No, there's nothing. Anything, please? You could come to the funeral. Leslie would like that. Of course, we'll be there. Hey, I saw that detective was here. Pam. Yeah. Was she here for anything in particular? She was asking about my Leslie... And your Rachel. I didn't want to say anything before... Say anything? What? I didn't want anybody to think badly of my Leslie. But that detective was so insistent. Tess, what did you say? The girls. They were stealing from that store. What? Clothes, bags, shoes. Leslie was afraid that they were gonna get them fired. Rachel was very careful. She told Leslie to stop fretting. And I was telling Leslie to stop. To promise me she would. The detective wanted to know all about that. She asked me if Les and Rachel ever fought. Such nonsense. What teenage girls don't fight? Honey, I thought you knew about the fight? How would I know? Wasn't Rachel upset after? Okay, bye. Greg, you were right about the police. I just talked to Tess, there's something you should know. Call me. Mom? Addy, go to your room. What's happening? Go, now! How could you do this? I'm sorry. It just started with some clothes. And then nobody said anything, so we took some shoes. And then-- I'm sorry. Do you have any idea what this looks like? I know! Oh my god, mom, please. Please don't make them take me away. Stay here. Please, I don't want to-- Quiet! Mrs. Kent, we're here to search the premises. Absolutely not. We have a search warrant. Please step aside. No. Mrs. Kent! Let me see it. Is there anyone else in the home? My daughters. Come on guys. Detective... detective! Rachel Kent, you are under arrest. No, no, please! Mom! Mom, what's going on? Pam, you have the wrong person! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Pam, please, stop this. Do you have receipts for those items? I don't have a choice here. I'm sorry. Please mom, please! Don't let them take me away! Pam, you have the wrong person! Rachel! I'm gonna be right behind you. Don't say anything to anybody. Mom, please! I thought you loved me? Don't let them take me away! Pam, she didn't do anything! Mom! Oh you're damn right I'm gonna sue. I'm gonna burn that whole department to the ground. If they want to pull this crap, then there's gonna be consequences. Listen, we'll talk more in the morning. Okay, bye. Everything's gonna be fine. You were right. They were out to get her and I let them. We'll get her back. This isn't gonna stick. The police are grasping at straws. All they have is $3000 worth of clothing. It's no big deal. Greg, she did steal those things. No she didn't. Yes she did. She told me. No... she didn't. Greg, we can't lie. I'm not gonna let my daughter get hurt. Not this time. Your friends at school said that they saw you and Leslie fighting. One witness said she saw you slap her across the face in the school parking lot. My parents say I'm not allowed to talk to you without my lawyers present. Perhaps you would like to explain why your shoe print was found in the victim's blood when, by your own account, you were passed out on the floor at the time? Detective? We're done. She's lawyered up. She won't say a word. Dad has her trained up. You put us in a real bind here, detective. ...and a role model to our youngest daughter. Our daughter is the victim of this terrible crime, not its perpetrator. We look forward to the immediate release of our daughter and a formal police apology. What did I tell you? I told you to handle this carefully. You were there to serve a warrant, not make an arrest. There was a mountain of evidence. More than enough to merit an arrest for larceny. And with Tess Miles' statement, we have prior incidents of conflict between the girls, which is motive for the murder. Did you know that woman was under a half dozen anti-depressants at the time you spoke to her? She was a little slow, yeah. A little slow? Cindy Kent says she was practically a zombie. You spoke to Cindy? Her and her husband. And she also told me you had no lawyer present when you re-interviewed her daughter. I thought she was a victim at the time. Well, her husband has filed a petition to throw out your interview with Rachel and the statement from Leslie's mother. We haven't even charged her with the murder yet. And we're not going to. We're letting her go. Okay, what about all the stolen property? Gregory Kent says they bought all those clothes. Oh, come on! Can you prove she stole them? We're charging Aaron Barker with the murder. He has an alibi. And you said that it was solid. Nobody wants this to continue, do you understand me? The stalker did it, and that's that. Now go home. And stay away from the cameras. I'm sorry about all the questions, Miss Kent. I just have one more and then you can go home, all right? Do you recognize any of these men? Him. He was at the store that day. And what did he do? He attacked me. He was the one! He killed Leslie. Okay Miss Kent, thank you very much. You can go. Mrs. Kent, your daughter is being released. No thanks to you. The Lieutenant told me that your husband purchased those items from your daughter's store? Tell me, did you buy Rachel some of those things? Umm, I'm-- Mom! Hi honey. Your dad's waiting by the car, so go ahead and I'll be there in a few minutes. Okay. Your daughter has been through a lot. I guess she deserves the benefit of the doubt. She does. The Lieutenant told us that a man was arrested for Leslie's murder? A boy. A 19 year old who had an infatuation with Leslie. Did he do it? It's possible. It's also possible that your daughter knew about Leslie s stalker. They would've talked about that kind of thing, wouldn't they? You should just be careful. She's only been living with you for three months, right? If you'll excuse me. Daddy! Rachel! You're so cute! Awww! Welcome home! Hi! Come here, come say hi! Oh you guys, I don't ever want to leave. You won't have to. Here, I got your favorite cheese pizza. Oh, so good! It feels good to have everyone under one roof again. Yeah. Honey, you understand... we had to lie. We had to fight fire with fire. We had to get her out of there. Well... we didn't have a choice. That's right. But we do have a choice about how we parent her from here on out. What do you mean? We need to talk to Rachel about what happened. I knew it. I knew the otherewould drop at. Can't we just get past this? I lied for you. And I lied for her. We're still her parents. Cindy! Greg, she was stealing! The police would say anything to-- We barely know anything about her. Or what she's been through. So I made my decision. She needs professional help and she's going to see a specialist. Cindy-- No! This is no longer up for discussion. Fine. Mom... dad. Sweetie, you should be asleep. I know, I... I just want to apologize. I never should have taken those things. And I really shouldn't have lied about it. I'm so sorry. chwere you fighting with Leslie? Hun-- Greg, this is important. I don't think this is the right time-- Please! Dad, it's okay. I was so stupid. We did fight. Leslie wanted to stop stealing and I said no. Maybe if I had just listened to her, maybe we would have gotten out of the store before those men came and maybe she wouldn't have-- Come here, sweetie. You know if you needed clothes, we would've bought them for you. Why steal them? I don't know! I thought maybe if I looked pretty and I didn't ask for much, that you guys would let me stay. Oh, Rachel... I just didn't want you to leave like mom did. We would never, ever leave you. You're my little girl and you're part of this family and you always will be, no matter what. You promise? I promise. Of course... I promise. Morning. Good morning. You want some coffee? Yes, please. Thank you. It's Leslie's funeral today. Hmm... Addy can go to school, but I'd like Rachel and I to go. Is that really necessary? Yeah. Plus it would give Rachel and me some mother daughter time. I'll take Addy then. Thank you. I'll tell the girls. I have another one to show you. What about this? Do you like this? Are you serious? It's gorge. It is pretty nice. I don't have anything like this. You know you could. You just need to know how to ask. It is nice, hey? It is really nice. Good morning girls. Today is a really important day. Rachel, please don't be late. Okay. Guess I better get ready to go. Rachel, come on. I told you not to be late! What is that? What? Don't you like it? Honey, you know you can't go like that. Please go change. You know what? I was thinking I really can't go to this funeral. Can you drop me off at school instead? No, you're going. Dad said I didn't have to. He did not. Go change. Mom, I can't. I don't want to see all those people there, crying about Leslie. It's just too hard. This is part of the grieving process. Well I don't care. Rachel, you need to go! People will expect it. Well they didn't have to lie next to Leslie's dead body all night! I'm sorry, but you're going to have to tough it out. Mom, I can't! Yes, you can. No I won't go, you bitch! Addy! Addy? What happened? We found him on the street. Someone must have hit him. I'm so sorry, Addy. He was such a good dog. I know how much you loved him. Must have been a hit and run. I thought I tied him up. This is horrible, honey. I'm so sorry. Addy and I came home from school and there he was, just lying there in the road, right in front of the house. A-hole didn't even move him out of the street. Teddy I miss you. He loved you too. Let's just thank god it wasn't you who got hurt. It's gonna be okay. We need to have a talk. It s gonna be okay. I'm very sorry. We'll get her a new dog, we can take her to the-- Where was Rachel when you and Addy found Ted? What? Was she here? She was with friends, why? I think she killed the dog. She did, Greg. And it was a warning meant for me. Cindy... Look at this. Look nice and close at this. Do you see that? She did that when I tried to make her go to the funeral. She told me. And...? I told her it was totally unacceptable and I grounded her for a month. That's it? What am I supposed to do? She told me that you grabbed her and told her to tough it out. Greg, she hit me. I'm not saying that hitting you is right Cindy, but she's just a child. She's a child who's been through more than you and I can possibly imagine and she was scared. But this whole business about the dog... Yeah. I think she hit him when you were gone. She didn't murder the damn dog! You don't know her, Greg! Stop it. We don't know what she's done. Leslie was just murdered. And they found the guy. That is over. No, I'm telling right you, she's very dangerous. And she could hurt Addy or one of us. I love you but... don't make me choose between... I love Rachel too. But she's lived here three months. How many times have you seen her in the past 15 years? Five? Six times? We barely know her. She could be seriously damaged in ways that we don't even understand yet. That's my baby girl up there. I have to go down to Newport for a few days. When I get back, maybe we can call a counsellor. You like that? Yeah. Good morning. Morning, dad! Want some OJ? Thank you. Alright, I'm off. Bye dad. Have a good trip. Bye. Love you both. Love you too. Be good. Umm, my phone... Oh, I think I saw it in the dining room. You forgot this... Looks like you found all the best divorce lawyers in the state, congratulations. That's not mine, I didn't look that up. We've been married for 15 years and this is what I get? We had one fight and you want to cut and run? I didn't search for that, Rachel must've done that! Oh for god's sake, you're blaming this on her too? Well, why would I do that? Girls, go back to the other room! Why don't you believe me? I didn't do this. I can't do this right now. We need to talk about this now! It's okay. Here, why don't you try and eat something? You have something you want to tell me? Come on, Addy. We better go, we're going to be late for school. No, I'm taking her! Mom? Addy, you're going with me today. Grab your bag. Okay. See you guys later. Bye, sis. Addy... Yeah? You wait for me to pick you up, understand? Only me. Why, what's wrong? I don't want you driving home alone with Rachel. I don't get it. Just do as I say! I'm sorry. I need you to be safe, okay? Please just do as a I ask. All right? Okay. Thank you, I love you. I'm gonna pick you up here after soccer. Okay, I love you too. Detective Cherfils, could I have a moment? Mrs. Kent, I have a briefing. Pam, please. Go ahead. How is the case going against that boy, Aaron Barker? The DA is moving towards a prosecution. There's very little physical evidence, and Barker has a solid alibi, but of course, we have a witness. Our dog was killed yesterday. Okay. I think Rachel did it. And what about those cuts on your neck? They're from yesterday when I tried to make her go to Leslie's funeral. You can press charges if you want. That's not enough. What do you want from me? I want her out of my house. Cindy, there's not much I can do. Greg and I lied. We didn't buy her those things. She stole them all. I know. But you need to understand, there's no turning back. The department, along with the newspapers and the whole city have concluded that Rachel is innocent. We've charged someone else with Leslie's murder. Some scratches and a dead puppy aren't gonna change that. Look... Bring me something new, something concrete, and I will look into it. Okay, thank you. And Cindy, call me if anything happens. I'll help keep an eye out for you and Addy until we get this worked out. Thank you. Hello? Hi, I'm calling from the law offices of Gersh and Hatzenberg. We're serving a summons against a former resident of your apartment complex, Martha Cook. She left quite a few unpaid bills and we're just trying to get a forwarding address. Let me check. Okay. Thank you very much, bye. Hello Crestview Motel, how may I help you? Hi, could you put me through to Martha Cook's room, please? Martha's on a shift right now. I can have her call you back on her break. Could I take a message? Oh. Uh, no that's okay, I'll just call on her break, thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Martha? Could I talk to you for a few minutes? I can't, I just-- Ten minutes, please? Okay. Thank you. What do you want? I'm having some real difficulty with Rachel. She's turned my entire family against me and it's to the point where I don't feel safe leaving her with my daughter Addy. I want you to know that I'm not judging you. I want to help Rachel, but I can't do that unless I know what her real problems are. So I'm hoping that maybe you could help me understand her, possibly? Okay. Okay. When you started using, how did Rachel react? Using? When your addiction first started. Addiction? I was never on drugs. You called Greg a year ago, asking for money. I never called Greg. I haven't talked to Greg in like five years. That must've been Rachel that called him. Maybe she got him to send her money? I don't know. I never saw any of it. But if you didn't leave for an addiction, then... I left because I was scared. Martha... She did this to me with a pair of scissors when I told her she couldn't go to a concert with her friends. It took me a long time to accept it, but she-- Rachel doesn't... She doesn't feel things the way that other people feel things. The way that people are supposed to feel things. She's different. I tried to get her help, but she has a way of making people see only what she wants them to see. When she got really violent, It got so hard I just I couldn't leave my room. I couldn't fall asleep. I was a prisoner in my own house, so... I left. I just left. Martha, why didn't you tell us? I couldn't say anything, I mean... where would she go? Who would take her in? Greg and I maybe-- If I told you what she was, would you have given her a home? Would you have given her a room next to your own daughter? No, I couldn't say anything. They would've put her in foster care or she would've ended up living on the street. Running away was the last good thing I did for my daughter. The last good thing? Martha, do you have any idea what you've done? I know, I'm sorry. She killed a sweet, innocent teenage girl named Leslie Miles. I'm sorry, but you have to understand-- No, I don't have to understand! You put my whole family and me in danger! She's my daughter. So what? I'm sorry, I can't do this. Martha! Martha I-- Greg, it's me. I just met with Martha-- I know you think I'm crazy but Rachel really is dangerous. So dangerous that Martha felt like she had to disappear to get away from her. Martha never received any of your money because she wasn't the one calling you! Rachel needs serious professional help. I don't feel safe with her in the house. Greg, we need you. I need you. Please just come home. Addy I'm so sorry, I'll be there in 20 minutes. It's okay, Rachel picked me up. Addy, listen to me. I want you to run over to Mrs. Wellington's house and stay there until I get there, okay? Mom, what's wrong? Just do what I'm saying! Go! Addy? Can I say hi? Sure. There you go. Thank you. Addy? Hi mom! Rachel? You really don't have to worry. Addy and I are doing just fine here. Rachel, listen to me. How was your day? Where have you been, mom? Rachel, put Addy back on the phone. Hmm... Rachel, let me talk to my daughter. I thought you were. Am I not your little girl anymore? Rachel... Rachel, please! Detective Cherfils. Pam, it's Cindy. I have that information that you needed. Martha Cook has the scars to prove how dangerous Rachel is, there's a well documented history of Rachel's violence in her care! Okay Cindy, I will check into it. She took Addy, they're alone in the house and I'm a half hour away! Cindy, don't worry. I'll head over there right now and talk to her. Please hurry! We can decide how to move forward when you get there, okay? Martha never received any of your money because she wasn't the one calling you! Rachel needs serious professional help. I don't feel safe with her in the house. Greg, we need you. I need you. Addy? Addy? Pam? Rachel... Shh! I don't want you to wake her. What did you do to her? Just a little something to help her sleep. I decided you were right. It was time I paid my respects to Tess. I told her about my horrible nightmares and she was kind enough to share. What did you do today, mom? Did you meet anyone interesting? What? You think find-my-phone only works for your kids? We can spy on you just as easily. You're sick, honey. Is that what she said? No honey, you need help. Do I really look like I need help? I have the whole world wrapped around my little finger. You of all people should know that by now. And if I don't get what I want, there are consequences. No. Don't touch her, please. I just love how she sleeps. Rachel... So innocent. Like nothing in the world can hurt her. Don't please. Your precious Addy. Your one and only. No-- no. See? Everybody lies! Even you. Like when you said I was part of the family, remember? When you said I was your daughter too. Oh honey, you are part of the family. You are my daughter. And now you want to send me away? Just like Martha. I just want to help you. By putting me in a padded room? No-- I mean you need help. But I will be there with you. I promise I will do this with you every step of the way. Honey, I love you. You are my daughter. Please! I'm asking you please put the gun down. We can do it together. We will fix you together, I promise. Wow, you're really good at this! Maybe you are my mother. No! No! Please, don't do anything to-- Oh god, it's not for her. I wouldn't hurt my own sister. It's for you. Back up. See, I need this to look very real, so... I'm going to have to ask you to kill your friend Pam. What? That's right. Then I'm gonna shoot you in self defense. And then when daddy gets home, I'll explain to him how-- How mom just hated me so much. And when she asked me to leave, she got really angry and she threatened to kill me. Then that policeman came and she attacked her too and I just had to protect myself. Oh, Rachel. See, I could do it myself but this is going to work out much better. Now pick it up. I can't. Well then I'm going to have to shoot all three of you. No! Okay, just wait. Oh god. I don't know how I'm gonna do this. Just do it, or Addy dies. Okay, just... I don't know how. I'm sorry. This must be really difficult for you. But, you know, it's just not that hard. Actually, it's pretty easy... We agreed no more. Yeah, well I changed my mind. What? You want some? I'm telling the manager. No, you can't do that! She'll fire you. Maybe, but I'm not going to jail. No... you can't do that! Now it's your turn. Okay, Rachel? How did you deal with the guilt? Afterwards, how did you deal with it? Don't worry, you won't have to. Now! Okay. We're in here! Stop! My god, what's going on? Cindy attacked me! She tried to kill me. No I didn't. She attacked that police woman. She tried to kill me. No, she did! Cindy, give me the gun. I didn't do anything Greg. Honey, give me the gun, please. Okay Greg, Pam will be able to explain. I'm sure she will. Just give me the gun first. Daddy, I love you. Please don't let her hurt me daddy, please! Please don't let her hurt me. Cindy, I trust you. I got your message, I came straight home. Are you alright? No daddy, please. Stop Rachel! Please, please I love you daddy! Stop it! Stop lying. Cindy, I'm sorry. I should've listened to you. Mom, please... please. Daddy, please! Please, no! Please... I'm so sorry. I nearly lost everything. Yeah, but you didn't. We're still here. And we're gonna try, right? Hi, Rachel. Hi dad, hi mom! Oh, it's so good to see you guys again. You have no idea. I missed you so much. You look good, Rach. Thanks, mom. Did you guys talk to the lawyers yet? Did he say when I can go home? Not yet, honey. Oh, really? Well I know he's probably really busy. Maybe you guys can talk to him again and tell him that I really didn't mean those things. I'm sorry but I'm so much better now. I just want to be a part of the family again. I love you guys so much. We love you too, Rach. Hey, what do you want to do today? I brought cards, and the movie that you like. Let's play a game. Okay. Hearts? What do you think Rach? Yeah, sure. I guess we can talk about that stuff later. Hey guys. Hey angel. Oh my god! Hi! You like him? I love him. And she's all yours. Will you take care of her? I will, I promise. What an angel. She's a little angel, right? She's perfect mom! Okay. Think of a good name.
