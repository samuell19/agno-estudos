[dreamy instrumental music] ♪ [skateboard wheels spinning] ♪ You're listening to KTUH 90.1 FM Honolulu, you're listening to an edition of Night Drive. That's my show. The show that makes you feel cool as you drive late at night. The show that makes you feel cooler than you actually are as you speed down the freeway and go about your misdeeds. Just now, you heard one of my favorite songs by a classic New York band. That is, of course, Richard Hell and the Voidoids. I've been playing a lot of New York lately. Richard Hell is also... just such an underrated name. And even he undersells it. His biography, I think, was called, like, I Dream I Was a Very Clean Tramp. He talks about his family, growing up, um, his friends and his... his family as friends, which I relate to a lot. I grew up in Kaimuki, so did most of my friend group and it's, like, interesting how I can read about Richard Hell living in this creative friendship ecosystem in New York and feel like I understand it. You know, he had CBGB. Me and my friends have Kaimuki Park. It's the same thing. Only considerably smaller and extremely less cool.

Congratulations. - Thanks. That's wonderful news. Yeah, I mean, I really didn't expect to get in. Oh, I'm not surprised. You're really talented. Well, Naz really wanted me to apply, so I did, but... I don't know. Hmm. I see. How is Mr. Kawakami these days? You know, I really think he'd be much cuter if he shaved. Apparently it's really hard to try and ship a cat across the country. - Boys and their cats. - Yeah. I know Pratt's this great opportunity and I should be really grateful for it, but... it's gonna be really hard to leave this. And, you know, to leave you. Hey. You know, I went to NYU, right? New York is a great place to be in your 20s. It's full of artists. Have you told him how you feel? It's kinda hard to find the right time to bring it up.

It's because you're now giving me different information from the person I spoke to last week from that airline. Yeah. Yeah. So, she told me... Right. So, she told me 20 lbs is the limit. And my cat is far less than 20 lbs. That seems more like a rule for dogs. I'm not trying to do that. I just have one small cat. She is six and she's maybe 12 lbs. Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah, see, so that's where it's a little bit different, is I was confused. I'm confused by the conflicting information you've been giving me. Yeah. - [Chris] Hey. - [Naz] Mm-hmm. [Chris] I'm Chris from Craigslist. - Cool. - Yeah. All right, so, I was told there was a 20-lbs limit. Combined weight? What does combined weight mean? Like me and the animal? The... the animal and the container. Okay. So, I do need to get, like, a special kind of container? Mm-hmm. And that's cool with me. Right. I just need to know what that is. I just need know what kind of container I need to get. You know, like, are there dimensions or something like that? Is there like a... A airline-approved... I don't know, like, specifications of some kind? A brand issue? Any container? So, I could... So, I could put her in a trash bag if I wanted to, is what you're saying? As long as doesn't encumber other passengers. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I just don't how much that costs. I don't... Will I be charged extra for a larger than normal container?

Thanks for listening to KTUH 90.1 FM Honolulu. [traffic din] [Sloane] Did you know I wanted to be a vet when I was a kid? [Naz] Mm-mm. [Sloane] My parents got me a white coat with my name on it like I was a vet. And I'd go around the neighborhood and I'd heal all the animals. Oh, you'd heal them? Well, they weren't sick to begin with. They were just, like, neighborhood pets, but... I don't know. I felt like I was doing something good. I felt like I was good at it. Yeah. You were good at it. Yeah. You were keeping them happy. It's not nothing. What happened with that? Well, why aren't you a vet? What happened? I was walking around the neighborhood one day and I found this really old, really bony cat under Mrs. Chin's porch. But she just growled when I tried to pet her. I came back the next day or, like, the day after and brought her real cat food and... And when I tried to pet her she wouldn't move. She wouldn't even make a sound. I'm sorry. [traffic din] [pop-punk music playing] [clerk] How can I help you? [Naz] Um, do you have cat carriers, like crates for, like, airplanes? [clerk] I do. Yeah. Hold on one second. Let me get you some models up. I have these two guys. Um, this model's gonna be more ideal for traveling. [Naz] Mm. This one is a little bit more lightweight and is more for, like, a rescue situation. - [Naz] How much is that one? - This one goes for about 175. [Naz groaning] Is there anything cheaper? [clerk] It would only be this one. It just depends on how much you care about your cat. [Naz] I do like her. Like, saved her life. [clerk] Oh, yeah? Like you adopted her, or... [Naz] Yeah, I adopted her. And then the... I gave her, like, the Heimlich maneuver - once when she was choking. - Oh, seriously? [Naz] She's a fat cat, and she eats a lot. - She, like, eats so much. - Yeah. [Naz] The first time she did it she was, like, eating her food. She was just, like, looking up, and I'm, like, staring at her for, like, ten seconds, and just, like, she's not blinking. She's just, like, cough... like, just coughing. And looking at me like I'm supposed to know what that means. So, like, I Googled, "cat coughing?" And then it showed me, like, a wikiHow on how to give a cat the Heimlich maneuver. So, there's one way you can do it where it's like, put her... Like, you do the Heimlich, like you put her on a couch armrest so her legs and her feet are just, like, hanging off. And then just like... Like, pumped her like I was pumping up an air mattress. [clerk laughing] God! [Naz] And she, like, vomited all over my couch and then looked at me. Doesn't say thank you and goes back to... Continues to eat her food. [clerk] Well, I'm very happy that you saved her life. - [Naz] I'm sure she is, too. - Yes, absolutely. I question that decision sometimes. [whispering] Ah... fuck. - Does this come with the leash? - It does. [Naz] I'll take it. [clerk] You must love her very, very much. I think it's an excellent choice. [Naz] I... She's fine, I guess. - Hey. - [DJ] Hey. Is this is your last show? [Naz] No, I got a few more after this. [DJ] When do you leave-leave? [Naz] Uh, soon-ish. Wait. Is she taking her ceramics with her? [Naz] Didn't you already ask me that? I dunno. We haven't planned that far yet. I dunno. Well, let... let me know. I want to get first dibs. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll let her know. - Look at you. - I know. Moving to the big leagues. Are you still gonna come to my show next week, right? [Naz] Oh... Honestly dude, like, I'll do a lot of stuff, but, like, I don't think so, no... [DJ] All right, well, play some "Wonder wall" for me. [Naz] Yeah, okay. Thanks, buddy. - [DJ] Enjoy. - Yeah. Hello. How's the studio? Leftovers is fine. What kind of wine do you want? Yeah. Um, I was thinking, though, if it's cool with you, I'd really like to go and skate with my friend. All right, yeah, I know.

[Naz] Yeah, dude, does the trick. - How much do you pay here? - [Naz] Um, about 1200. - Damn, dude. - [Naz] Yeah, dude. - [Kayden] Oh. Is this a girl? - Um, yeah, that's her. Kind of young, yo. I took that photo, like, two years ago. Wait, how long have you guys been together? Uh, like a year, but we've known each other for, like, - a decade. - Huh. And now you're moving for her. [Naz] Not moving for her, for the third time. She wants to do this program, so that's why we're going. [Kaden] Yeah. I got to ask, though. I mean, it seems like you have a pretty sweet setup going on. Like, why the sudden move? [Naz] Uh, what do you mean? I don't know. I mean, you got a bunch of friends here. It's like everywhere we've gone, you haven't paid for anything. Like, you got the girl, you got the solid crib. [Naz] Oh, you know. I wanted to go, like, my whole life, I just kept getting stuck. I feel like I'm... if I stay here much longer I'm just gonna be, like, quitting. - Quitting what? - [Naz] Quitting life. You know, surrendering to an easier path. Like, I'm a Hawaiian guy who grew up in Hawaii and then never left Hawaii and I've been here... comfortably been here. Um, I want to see what I'm worth outside of the context of Kaimuki, you know? Like, I don't look Hawaiian and never felt like I fit in, really, so... Oh, shit, so, you're like... You're like, Hawaiian-Hawaiian, like, blood? Yeah, I'm like Hawaiian-Hawaiian. You're like blood Hawaiian. - I'm like blood. - Okay. - It's in my blood. - Oh. I just don't look as Hawaiian as you do. I mean, you could pass for... - No, no, I can't. - Some... - Really? - No. You can pass for Hawaiian. I can't pass for Hawaiian. I think... I... I think it's fine. I'm not... I'm not passing for Hawaiian, dude. Like, this is why I don't go to the beach. Yeah. I mean, I get it. Like, I kind of went through the same thing coming from Maui, you know, leaving home, leaving friends. But I know that's always gonna be... Maui's always gonna be home. And I'm sure you feel the same way, too, about here. But I get it. You got to do it on your own sometimes. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. [Kaden playing guitar] She hasn't packed anything yet. When do you guys leave? Like, soon. Maybe tell her to pack. [sighing] Yeah. [New York accent] Maybe I'll tell her to pack. - Tell her to pack. - Tell her to pack her stuff. Or she'll be sleeping with the fishes. Gotta get outta here. Get outta heres! [Kaden] Dude, this rail is sick. [Naz] Oh, yeah. My friends skate that. I can't skate that, but, um, my friend Kelly, like, [indistinct]. And then, my friend Michael did not know that it was waxed and just, like, rushed it. And then, he just, whacked his sack so hard. Like I've never seen. It was painful to watch. God damn there are a lot of cars. Overpopulation is just... I don't understand this stop sign. It's shit. [Kaden] Yeah, it's very, very, very strange. This freeway, I feel like was built... like, all these roadways were built for when there was, like, 30 cars on this island and they just never adapted it to the times. Like, all these bridges are, like, "Built in 1961 when we got our first Chevy." It's just, like, dude, we've got fuckin' Teslas now. You should compensate for that stuff. - [Kaden] Hot, yes? - [Naz] No, man. That... that app seems stressful. [Kaden] I dunno, man, it seems like being in a committed relationship is more stressful. Like, I don't think I'll ever get married. - [Naz] Really? - [Kaden] Yeah. I just feel like humans aren't meant to be monogamous. That's why I'm just ethically non-monogamous. [Naz] I feel I would... I'm ethically non-wealthy. But you should give love a shot, man. You know, it's not all that bad, aside from when it's the fuckin' worst. [Kaden] I just, I worry about it being weighted, you know. I mean, like, what about you and Sloane? You ever feel like she's into you more than you are her, or the other way around? [Naz] No man. Nah. She's into me. She cares about me. She just, like, has a difficult way of showing it. You know, she's, like, she's very empathetic, but kind of like, to the point of, like, not even being very expressive about it. Does that make sense? [Kaden] I get... I get what you're saying, but, uh, not really, no. I mean, I guess not. - [Naz] Oh. - [DJ] Hey. You're still here? [Naz] I am indeed still here. [DJ] Are you still moving? [Naz] Yep. Yeah, I'm going. I heard you're moving out, too. [DJ] Yeah, I scored this, uh, assistant programing job, so I'll finally be, like, a paid person working in radio. [Naz] Really? I didn't know those jobs existed. I will listen and admire your success from afar. [DJ] Yeah. So I asked if you're really moving because management wants me to build my own [indistinct] with DJs, with a focus on local music. It pays. It's a full-time job with some minor benefits and it would be a daytime slot. People would actually hear you. - You'd have an audience. - [Naz] Yeah. Yeah, my girlfriend, she's doing this, like, program in New York City. - She has to go there to do it. - [DJ] Oh, yeah. I get it. Totally. If things change, keep me in mind. You know, we could start a whole new movement together. [Naz] Yeah, yeah. A new movement. Right. Yeah. Yeah, man. But, you know what? Yeah, thank you. I really... I really appreciate that, dude. - Thank you. - [DJ] Yeah. No problem, bro. [Naz] Okay. Cheers. Well, now that you're finally home, you can help me get my stuff out of my car. [Naz] Yeah. Okay, just need a minute, please. Are we even partners in this? [Naz] What? I've been-I've been preparing. I've been doing stuff. [Sloane] Giving your stuff away doesn't necessarily mean you've been preparing to move. - Ran into Jane today. - And? [Naz] Said you're thinking about going on tour. Well, yeah. Technically, I can fly in from anywhere. And airfare is compensated. So, why wouldn't you just tell her you're flying in from New York? [Sloane] Because I didn't know that that's what we were gonna be doing. Besides, they're offering the program virtually upstate now. [Naz] Fucking virtually. Are you in this? Are you having second thoughts about this? Maybe this isn't the right time for us. What do you mean? I've given away half of my shit. Everyone thinks we're going. I know. Look, um, will you please help me get my stuff out of my car? [Naz] Yeah. Why didn't you mention any of this sooner? I didn't think the pandemic would still be going on. And besides, I'm helping Jane at the studio, Naz. If I left, I'd be abandoning her. So what, you're-you're just content to be a fuckin' big fish in a small pond? - So, what if I am? - That's just fine with you? [Sloane] This is the greatest pond to be in. You fail to recognize that. That's just fuckin' pathetic, man. You don't want more for yourself? You don't want more for us? I want you to want more for us. I can't do this. Hey, I'll see you at the art show, right? - No. - All right. - [Ebi] Yo. - Yo. [Ebi] So, you're still here, huh? - Yep. I'm still here. - [Ebi] Sick. You're about to pay my rent. Why am I about to pay your rent? [Ebi] Well, we took a bet, whether you'd be moving or not, and, well you're still here. [laughing] Who's taking bets? This guy. [Naz] He's making bets. Maybe, maybe, maybe. [Naz] What the fuck? Dude. What? [Naz] You're fuckin' taking bets on me? What's your problem, dude? Why the fuck are you taking bets? I'm betting that you're going to go, dude. You're taking money on if I'm leaving. I'm betting again... uh, with you, that you're gonna go. - [Naz] Why would... - So that you will go. Why would you take bets that I might not go? Why would you take bets? Why... why would you even allow that to be a fuckin' possibility? Are you not gonna fucking go this time, or what? I am going. I'm trying to do something fucking good for myself. [Jordan] Dude, that's why I'm supporting you. You're not being fucking supportive. Dude, it's dude. [Naz] You have so much to gain if I stay.
