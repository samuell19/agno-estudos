Let us through Everyone in the building got sick after drinking the water, Sir Has the tap water been checked? I don't know Where's the bathroom? Right inside Who called in the report? A guy named Ting, second floor Find out how to reach him Get his work number his pager, anything Tell him to come home immediately Something's happened Brother Kwan Will you come out and have a drink with me? No thanks. You'd better go home and go to bed How can I fall asleep? Is the architect dead? Knock it off I can't get him out of my mind Did he die when we stabbed him or did we drown him? Wah, shut up! He deserved it. He forced us to do it We're going be rich soon! Then, we'll leave the country After awhile no one will remember anymore It's late Go home and go to bed Who are you? Don't resist! We're with the Special Crime Bureau We're taking you down to headquarters Stop resisting! What? What's going on? A murderer can never escape the law Take your time. Look carefully He asked me to collect the debt that the man lost at the track But when I got there, he didn't have it He asked me not to force him Then he ran to the roof and threatened to kill himself I tried to pull him down How did I know, he'd pull a knife and stab me? I just wanted to take his knife away But in the confusion I didn't mean to kill him Why did you throw his body in the tank? I didn't know what to do I was so scared at that moment You were scared? What happened then? Then, I just left Sir, may I have a cup of coffee? Please And a piece of toast, too Please, sir - Don't annoy me - Give it to him You were at the victim's home many times You must have known the watchman would recognize you You should have turned yourself in What did you take from the victim's home? You stayed there after you killed him We found your fingerprints in his study room What were you looking for? Money He owed me money. I wanted it back I just wanted money This blueprint. Where did you get it? Was it taken from the victim's home? It's mine This is a blueprint of a vault The entrance and exit are detailed in it Where is this vault located? Here Thank you We found these items where we arrested you What are they? Nitric acid, vegetable oil, potassium And these, blast wires, fuses and a remote control These are for making bombs What do you have in mind? Are you trying to rob a vault? Sir, I'm being very cooperative I really don't know anything about what you're asking I'm not able to answer you Ask him any other weapons? Any accomplices? Darn you! Talk! Talk! I really don't know anything You should know this person, right? That's Chan Wah, Mak Kwan's cousin He was caught operating an illegal horse betting parlor in 1 992 He did 2 years in jail The apartment where we caught you is rented under his name You should know him, right? OK. I know him Sir Go on You said these things aren't yours or Mak Kwan's That means they belong to Chan Wah Chung Lai Hung, you'd better cooperate with us What exactly are you charging me with? Aiding and abetting a suspect possession of illegal explosives, withholding information Yung, take a break Chung Lai Hung Mak's confessed to all charges He said you're not involved But whether we believe him or not depends on you Now we're going to add one more charge The intent to rob the vault You know about this plan, right? Why don't you ask Mak Kwan? Miss Chung, here's the situation Mak's confessed to all the charges Because he doesn't want you involved We already know about his accomplices and his weapons and we already have all the evidence we need I personally don't think you're involved Tell me where his accomplices and the weapons are and we'll let you go Thank you for your valuable information When you can remember anything please inform my colleagues Mak Kwan, family from Chiu Chou, born in Hong Kong in 1 964 Graduated from HKU with a degree in Civil Engineering in 1 986 Senior Engineer with Wingtai Construction Ltd from 86 to 93 His field was construction site demolition Sir Sit up straight In 1 993 you abused your position at work and were fired for illegally selling explosives Since then you've been unemployed You're an expert at demolition Surely you must know how powerful this explosive is It can destroy half this station What are you saying? These aren't mine Not yours? I'll go next door and ask your girlfriend if they're hers It's got nothing to do with her Let her go and I'll confess to all charges No way Unless you tell us what were you going to rob? How many people are working with you? What weapons do you have? You're just out to crack a big case aren't you? Let me go and I'll do something big If you're able to, you can arrest me then I think we're in for another hard time Yes, Sir Mak Kwan confessed to the charges and will be sentenced to life in prison You're all right for now If you have any information about the robbers call my mobile phone Let's try to help each other out Fine Hello. This is Sung Siu-hung Where are you calling from? Go check out Kwan Brother, it's Siu-hung Did you tell the police about us? Yes. . . After you see him, we'll meet at the usual place, 8 p.m. I'll call you Do you know the place? That's all for now What's up? Siu-hung said the police are on to our plan We've been exposed She hasn't seen Mak Kwan, has she? We might have problems with immigration when we leave Let's get a new address first and change the phone numbers immediately Isn't it safer to go back to Taiwan now? You gotta be kidding We came here to make money, how can we quit now? Wah, give us a minute We have something to discuss We thought we'd found the right guy he dragged us into this shit instead So what does this all mean? We always do a clean job I think this time there's no way out Boss, what are you saying? Are we supposed to bust him out of prison? He's not even our friend All the more reason, because he isn't our friend There's nothing to keep him from implicating us If we don't do it, we'll never be safe We have to risk it And if we can't free him, we kill him What do you think? I buy whatever you say But Chan Wah may not go along If he doesn't get rid of him OK Please have a seat Keep an eye on her May I take your order? Iced tea Iced tea, please Bill, let me remind you Mak Kwan is in trouble now because he lost a few million betting on horses I had a few million? Keep a sharp eye on the target Everyone knows you're involved with big jobs so you're very popular A lot of guys want to be friend with me I have a private room and a private toilet here Only no doors, just bars People can see everything I do What's wrong? I'm still alive. The sky hasn't fallen Cheer up! Since I haven't been with you for awhile there must be a lot of bloodhounds on your tail You know what I mean? You're back! Yes Why didn't you call me last night? I was busy Did the criminal confess? Yes, he did How's the baby? Good. Yesterday he learned how to write his name He was hoping to show you when you came home Oh! The construction foreman who used to work for you asked me to send you his regards Please tell them that I wish to have tea with them and talk about the new project You're still thinking about that? I think they may have dropped the idea But how can they earn a living doing nothing? Right? He's obviously asking his gang to get him out They'll probably make their move when we transfer him to court Officer Pao, Chan Wah does have an account with the Jockey Club In fact, he made a bet today What race is running right now? The seventh This is a record of his bets today Seventh race, horses one, four and two Eighth race, horses ten, six and three Ninth race, horses five, three and seven He bets a lot! He's very confident The bets were made awhile ago so we can't trace them You're joking? We have no right to ask the HKJC to stop a horse from racing Do you know the pot is always over 1 00 million in each race? Each horse takes in at least 1 0 million But I'm sure those thieves are well-armed If there's a gun battle, there'll be a lot of causalities We've got to apprehend them before we move Mak Kwan to court But our only clue to their whereabouts is to get Chan Wah to bet again Tomorrow we escort Mak Kwan along this route Listen carefully tomorrow I want you all on full alert We could run into these guys at any moment, understand? Yes, Sir Any questions? Officer Pao, the fifth horse in the ninth race just dropped out Television Horse number five has suddenly dropped out due to health Watch Chan Wah's account If you've bet on this horse, it can be refunded If you want to change your bet, better be quick There are only three minutes left till the race Chan may bet again The race is about to start Number one, Power is the dark horse Chan Wah's betting Trace the call Number four, Bravo doesn't seem like a good bet I suspect its performance Number five is attracting a lot of support but let me remind you, it's dropped out of the race If you want to bet on another horse, better be quick The race starts in 30 seconds The number is 2381 5746 Pull me up an address Nathan Road, Po Ning Building, 1 4th floor, Room 2 Let's go - Where's your captain? - Inside, Sir Don't block our way Leave here I'm with the SCB. What's happened? One of the units is leaking gas We've called the Fire Department Which apartment? Room 3 on the 1 4th floor The electricity is out Only the elevator for the odd floors is working Maybe they knew we'd come and they're pulling something Should we wait for the firemen? Let's go up 1 4. One more floor Hold the elevator Hey, buddy, we're with the SCB - Can I use your flashlight? - Yes, Sir After me Ma'am, may I use your flashlight? Thank you This is the unit Stay back Careful. If you fire we're in deep shit, you know? Stand back If we force the door and there's a spark it'll explode To stop this crime, I'll take the risk Officer Pao let me do it Open the windows. Turn off the gas Open all the windows That's nitric acid Get out! It's dangerous! Run! Run! Come out of there What is it, Sir? You'll find out Why so late, Sir? If you're planning an escape you're dreaming I don't know what you're talking about Tomorrow we've assembled a team to escort you A team of over one hundred cops and thirty vehicles There'll be roadblocks at all major exits to check suspicious cars If your buddies have the balls to try to save you even if they've got AK-47s we've got MP-5s And I'm telling you man-to-man you step even one foot outside the prison van I'm shooting you myself no matter what If you don't want to die tell your buddies not to show up If you'd like to inform them, I'll help arrange it I met my girlfriend when I was in college Her ex-boyfriend organized a gang to attack me They kept stabbing me with a knife Until I was lying on the floor, my body I can't remember anything after that except they all looked so scared I moved in with the girl but they never came after me I could never figure out why until recently. Now I know It's not an easy thing to kill someone Have you ever killed someone? You can't forget it for the rest of your life The struggle of the dying The scream of death It lasts less than a minute But it takes forever That architect wakes me up every night with his noise You can't know better than I do Then neither of us are normal people Tomorrow, when you're about to shoot Don't tremble Eat your breakfast I have no appetite Look at you, you're all dirty Hurry up. It's time for school Baby, greet your daddy Tell Daddy to eat his breakfast Daddy, eat breakfast Get me some stomach pills I know where they are.

How's it coming? I don't recognize anyone What? You can't identify him? I just got a glance at him Even a rookie could recognize a suspect How did you get pass the promotion board? There wasn't any time. I didn't get a good look Why don't you just admit you're scared? The distance between us was just one foot If I had stared at their faces It'd have been me that was killed instead You expect me to identify them? I expect you to arrest them , instead Think you can handle that? How can you talk to me like that? You think I don't want to arrest them? Then why did we sacrifice one of our men?

He has no reason to return to China Officer Pao Mak's girlfriend is getting a ticket for Macau Stop her from going, I don't care how Take her to the station if you have to But that'll arouse attention Our men can tail her It's not necessary to expose ourselves I can't lose her, got it? Yes, Sir Jackie, what's the matter with you? Why aren't you going? If I take one of the cars, you only have one left You won't all fit What has that got to do with you?

It's possible There are only three of us left Should we give it up? I killed the architect I escaped from prison. You think I'd quit now? The show must go on Good Another toast Don't take any photos How did Chung escape? The girl drove in. I tailed her God knows, she had a monthly ticket. I couldn't pay You're too careless! If your mind's on gambling, how can you work? Sir, I didn't No? What's this? Sir That's not for racing If you don't trust me, how can I work with you? I quit Sir, Bill is trying. Give him a chance Get him Yes, Sir Bill Officer Pao isn't himself He wants you back Since Yung was killed I haven't gambled Let's do it for Yung This drainage pipe was there before construction began To divert it would be too costly So, when they designed the building they worked around it How can you be so sure? I studied civil engineering in college If the architect hadn't also built the vault this would have stayed a secret How do you operate the outer door? They use two combination locks It must be opened by two people at the same time Before it's closed they have to set a time lock Only on the following morning can anyone open the outer door So there's plenty of time to move the money out You're late! Where's the girl? She's gone! She went that way Follow me Go check over there It's not easy to kill someone Come on, Kwan, they've seen us Kwan! Come on! . . . Hurry up! Run! Let's go Police! Freeze! Go Out of my way Sorry, Sir Take it easy. Your anger isn't going to help break this case Even though no bystanders were shot Your actions caused the accident You'd better come up with a good excuse for the report Thank you, Sir Officer Pao, please Mak Kwan I just called to see how the motorcyclist was doing He's fine. Thanks for your concern . How about you? You remind me of my friend in high school We were always fighting to be number one in the class I remember One year, he lost I saw him crying in the toilet stall That made me sad, too I hate the feeling of losing Mak just called me on my mobile phone Have somebody trace the call Give me a racing form Sir, I don't gamble When is the horse racing season over? It'll last a few more weeks Any special event this year? The betting's gone crazy in Hong Kong. The total bet is over 1 billion Over 400 million was bet on 3T The Chief Executive Cup Race is coming up They estimate the bets will exceed 2 billion Are you thinking they're going to rob the Jockey Club? Mak lost the savings and, thus, his future to the Jockey Club He can't admit failure So, he's going to take revenge I know he will! Let's see what they're doing There're over 1 30 betting counters inside the track After the races, the money's picked up and counted by the head cashier Then the money's escorted by security officers How many people does it take to count 1 billion? And how long does it take? Until it's all counted If there're any mistake, no one can leave When does the armored car leave? That's classified . I can't answer your question Afterwards the banks would be closed Where do you store the money? Is there a vault at the race track? Mrs. Pao? I've come to read the meter Please come in This is the director of the Jockey Club This is Officer Pao How do you do? What exactly do you want to know? You must have your own vault, right? Without the consent of the Board of Directors we can say nothing Look, some criminals intend to rob the Jockey Club We got this blueprint of one of the suspects Is this the blueprint for the Jockey Club's vault? I really wish you could cooperate with us I need to get permission from the directors before I can answer Permission Go to hell! What's going on? What happened? Could you have kicked the switched by accident? It's a beautiful day today for the Chief Executive Cup Race The track is crowded to overflowing with people The accumulated total for betting has reached over 1 .8 billion dollars! And it's broken another record! This is Mr. Lau . He's in charge of the vault He's the most knowledgeable about the money operations Please answer Officer Pao's question Of course, Mr. Chan I need to know if the money stays in the vault after the races? After counting, the money is transferred to the insurance company The money that hasn't been counted stays in our vault And it's counted and transported the next day Officer Pao, the last race has started The horses are rushing toward the finish Cyprus is running as fast as Lightening Go. . . Cyprus has passed I'm a Winner and Brasa And it's Cyprus! You know me well. You know I'm going to rob the Jockey Club You deserve a present I've left one in an abandoned car on the 3rd floor of the garage I guarantee it will give you an everlasting memory Trace the call The rest of you come with me Toss our your lunches! Don't touch the car! Officer Pao Stop the car! Spread out! Get the bomb squad down here Calling control, this is PC 3372 We've traced Mak Kwan's call He used your wife's mobile phone You'd better get back home Let us deal with this You get to your home Get a team over there. I'm on my way We're really making the police jump through hoops Tomorrow when they find the Jockey Club's been robbed They're going to look very stupid Kwan, don't be nervous It'll be fine Let's go Ready, Boss Here he comes - Officer Pao - How are my wife and son? I don't know. The team's up there now - Sir - Officer Pao Daddy There was a man. He said he was here to read the meter I let him in and he tied us up Then he locked us in a room I don't know when he left And then the police showed up Daddy - Hey - Yes Have you found anything? He set at your table, ate your food and read your paper We haven't found anything else You've got to get out right now! You can't stay here! Hurry! This guy sets bombs Arrange a car for my wife Right Sam, arranged a car for Office Pao Yes, Sir Is this car for me? Yes. Where do you want me to take them? Find a safe hotel and I want round-the-clock surveillance Which hotel, Officer Pao? Find one! Do I have to do it for you? Darling Have him take us to the police station. We'll be safe there Do what you have to do We'll wait for you there But you've got to be careful, OK? Please be careful I'll be fine Go on This is Pao, what's the status? The bomb squad is here It's a mercury switch so they don't want to move it They want to detonate it on-site This is just a diversion They must already be on the move Let me know if anything breaks That's all Anything happens? No Bill, this is Pao, how's the bomb? It was a dummy, a fake one A fake? What's happening? Go find out What's going on? Everything's in order Show me. Hurry! The vault has a time lock If it's not the fixed time, we can't open it So, what'll we do? We have to wait until 9 a. m. There's got to be another way The Directors have an override code Then why aren't you calling them? Kwan Send someone to check the circuit breakers What happened? Hurry! What are you doing? Help me Mak Kwan must be inside What's the problem? Mr. Lau isn't home I'll try his mobile phone What's this? If some of the staff get locked in We can pass them food and water through here What about the inside door? It opens from inside Mak Kwan!
