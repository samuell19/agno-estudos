I think he's dead. I dunno, bro. Mariusz will know. Mariusz! Is Hitler alive? Fuck knows. We'll throw him a birthday party anyway. - Sponge cake with mascarpone. - Fucking delish. Dibs on the swastika. You had it last time. The swastika is for everyone. Every single time. Come to Warsaw. It's not a postcard city. It's full of sex and money. This is cool. It's nice that everyone came. It'll be fucking dope. RYS SPEECH OUTLINE Roman, it's time. Roman! Scram. Okay, I'm good. Welcome, everyone, to Adolf Hitler's 132nd birthday party near Białystok. A party organized by the Radical Youth Society! Let's start with a few words about the birthday boy. He was one of the finest commanders and strategists, whose beautiful vision was brutally interrupted by his premature death. - So, dead. - He was a gentleman. - He fascinated women. - Are the girls coming? - What? - They came last year, right? No girls. They're unwell. And they're not answering calls. Moving on to the main event. Gentlemen! Let's unveil the symbol that defines us. A symbol that inspires respect among the true ones and fear among our enemies. Help me down. Fuck. - What? - Look here. Yeah? Police! Hands up! Police! I told you they'd be back! No, Fighting Poland... OPERATION: NATION Turn it off. Marlena, turn it the fuck off! Turn yourself off! You promised me headphones. I'll buy you a brain. - Seriously? - What? - I have ten more minutes to sleep. - Jeez. No way. What's that peacock doing on my side? I preferred soccer players on there, not some knights. And I preferred when you had Pokémon. - Technically, you still do. - It's BMZ, you moron. They have ten billion views. All of them yours? - Yeah. - Yeah. You've become less nice since you fell over. I didn't fall over. I was fouled. How many times do I have to tell you? My only chance to get out of here. Out of Białystok? First, out of this room. FIGHT FOR YOUR BROTHERS Staszek, hurry up. I want that Kim Jong-Un gone by the time I get back. - You wiener. - Staś! Goodbye, my beloved sister. Bye. Kim Young-mun, asshole. Hey, Stachu! WELCOME! Fuck. Morning, Boss. Yeah. V6, huh? Yeah. Work hard, Stachu, and one day I'll be able to afford more of them. Boss, can I talk to you for a second? Chop-chop. The building site's in shambles. I have three Grigoris but 29 fingers, so something doesn't add up. - I've been working here for almost a year. - Yup. So, you could say it's permanent. - And... - Nothing in life is permanent. Not even your damn fingers. I thought that maybe I could... I mean, maybe you could give me a contract, Boss. Staszek, stop swearing. Fuck... Boss... When I was sick for a week without pay, it was carnage. I'm 20 years old. I wanna rent a studio apartment. I share a room with my sister. I share with my wife and I don't complain. Relax, Staszek... - Boss... - You... - You know what you need, boy? - I'm telling you, Boss. Siberian ginseng. Siberian jeans-end? Ginseng, for goodness' sake! An immunity adaptogen. A dietary supplement. Staszek, I take seven different ones a day and look at me fucking go. Supplementation. Staszek, invest in yourself. Everyone in Poland says, "Give, gimme." Constant demands. Damn, everyone's on welfare. But you've got to be tough. I also barely make ends meet, but I keep moving forward. So, am I supposed to pay for the studio with that jeans-end? Watch it, Staś. You know how many Grigoris would die for your job? Literally. Fuck. Pola, you're back too soon. And that's the problem? - Me being back too soon? - You're right. Instead of pointing fingers... #MY PUSSY MY BUSINESS ...let's look for a solution together. - Three heads are better than one. - Who's that? This is... - Larysa. - Larysa. - With an "A." - "A." It's okay. Polaris, listen. I think that the level of partnership we've achieved allows us to move on to the next stage. You're proposing to me now? No. I was thinking more of polyamory. You can't be serious. Why? You're still looking for a topic for your master's thesis. Polyamory is an excellent topic. - I'd be happy to help. - There you go! Maybe on Thursday? I can't do Thursdays. Shut up, bitch! Whoa! Hey, Pola. I never thought you'd slut-shame anyone like that. No? Slut! Oh, so when a girl sleeps with multiple guys she's a skank, but when I sleep with multiple girls, I'm a cool dude and a hotshot? No, Kajetan. You're just an ordinary dick. - What are you doing? - I thought I'd tidy up. I'm moving the fuck out. - Where to? - I dunno. Home. Wait. I don't think I want a long-distance relationship. Besides, what about work? Do you even listen to me? I told you I was fired, you idiot. A week ago. Call me when you get there. She took my top. - It's cool, I'll get a new one. - My top. Going to Białystok? Watch yourself over there. As God is my witness, they made a swastika out of Jaffa Cakes there. There's nothing good over there. Due to the premises that raising an outstretched arm can be interpreted as a Roman salute, and the swastika is primarily a Hindu symbol of happiness, the court has not found evidence of promoting a totalitarian regime. This hearing is concluded. The defendants are free to go. See? I drew it right. Disgrace! DISTRICT COURT - Any comments on the ruling? - Hitler's birthday. What's next? - Dunno. His name day? - All right. Everyone, today's ruling only goes to show that patriotism in Poland is no longer a crime, and that there is a new political force, which shouldn't be underestimated. RYS. Thank you very much. - And the ruling? - Talk to my lawyers. - Just a few words. - Move! Staszek, I'm glad you came. Sure thing. You picked me up from training multiple times. Meet my staff. Mieszko, Mariusz, Brajan. From the Old Polish Brajanisław. It's a real name. Staszek Sułkowski, my cousin. - Staszek Sułkowski? SS. Respect. - I remember you. You scored five goals against Krypnianka. A fucking good game. - The riot after was even better. - Yeah. Good times. Torn ACL, meniscus... Remember that fundraiser I held? - Yeah. - That was for Staszek. - Fight for your brothers, yeah? - Time hits all wounds. Too bad you didn't see the people's faces when they announced the ruling. We're heroes like the cursed soldiers. - Except we're not cursed. - Except shut it, Mieszko. But they'll talk about us. There'll be... How should I put it? There'll be... - Street cred? - No, Staszek. Drop this Black slang. We should say, "Glory to the territory." Let's go. Dibs on the window seat! - Move, Brajan. - But... Fucking hell. Move, Brajan. Roman? Hitler's birthday, was that for real? Stachu, come on. You believe the media? How's work? - Okay. - Yeah? Ukry don't want to work for half of your measly pay? I've nothing against them but... It's either us or them. There's no other way. The trial of the Białystok neo-Nazi group, charged with celebrating Hitler's birthday, has ended. The boys really went all out. There even was a cake with a wafer swastika, which begs to ask if there was a clown. Actually, clowns were the only ones attending. Some German radio station. Gentlemen... I call for brain blitzkrieg. I expect each one of you to give me an idea for our next move. You think too, Staszek. I stay out of politics, man. It's time to make a decision, Staszek. No more soccer for you, right? Now what? You wanna spend your whole life in a cubbyhole? Beat your meat in the bathroom when everyone's gone to sleep? Or will you fight for yours? The nation needs you. I need you. This is your team now. Red means brave, white means blessed! RYS! White above anything else! RYS! Who? RYS! Charge! RYS! See ya. Roman, wait. When do you need the ideas? NSDAP. NSDAP? ...it'll be warm... Yesterday they said it would rain. See how these fuckers lie? What would you do to make a lot of people find out about you? How much time do you have? Look at me. This is how you choke the bitch. Hey! Like that! There's basically no way out of this hold. Mariusz, my towel is slipping off! There won't be towels out there! Break free! Mariusz, the practice is over! Give me a break! I'm so wired. I feel like... smashing someone's head in. Mariusz. - You're still in a towel? - Still. Everyone's coming soon. Where's that cubbyhole? Where's the rest? Most activists kinda lost their zeal after the birthday fiasco. Quick. The yoga guy's coming in half an hour, and he's a dick. - Why are we here? - Taking a modern approach. Hybrid war. Staszek, my blood, had a good idea. Tell them. We'll live stream the RYS manifesto and hope it goes viral. What about my idea? Catch a few Chechens, strip them naked and take photos? To show them up. I'm unprepared, okay? Roman? - What is this... plushie? - It's not a plushie. On the contrary! It's a Jew we're about to burn. It'll emphasize the message and add drama. RYS "The RYS manifesto." "The modern world presents us with many threats." "But we face them, proudly shouting out 'Death to enemies of the Fatherland!'" Death to the enemies of the Fatherland! "The fire that burns inside us, just like the flame behind me, will burn all that is evil and impure." "The burning effigy of a Jew represents the Catholic spirit... Move. ...which can't be extinguished by any form of leftism." Anything yet? - "Are they..." - What's wrong? "Are they the wafer guys? What flavor was the cake, fuckwits?" "Your cock." Try here. - What are they writing? - Adler: "Losers." Michał123: "Clowns." Fuck off, Adler. Fuck off... "From the ruins of the civilization of death and from the ashes of Zionism, like a phoenix, a great Poland shall be reborn." - Some Marlenka is roasting us hard. - Yeah. Fuck! It won't fucking burn. "According to EU regulations..." - What? - This is fireproof material. There's a symbol here. Fucking awesome. How was I supposed to know? Why don't you write that on your fucking forehead? I guess you'll end up drawing a swastika instead of a question mark! We could hang it. I conclude the manifesto with a rhyme. "The Jew is burning, free Poland is returning." What am I supposed to say now? "The Jew is hanging..." We are banging? I don't know. Maybe the lighter doesn't work? GOD, HONOR, FATHERLAND INDEPENDENCE You see that guy? He's got the nerve. - You, look at yourself. - What? - You're Black. - How do you know? Do I know you? I can see! Brajan, tell him. I'm out of patience. - Stop hitting on Polish girls, ape. - Karol, let's just leave. Where you going? "Where are." What? You missed the auxiliary verb. "Where are you going?" Nowhere. I'm waiting for Roman. - I don't want any trouble. - Roman's here. - Roman's here. - You're lucky, bitch. Sorry, but you'd better go. Fuck off, Nazi. To happy returns? Temporary ones. We'll see. Have you seen our city's motto? "Rising Białystok." - We're just getting started. - That's what worries me. So tell me, what even is a Larysa? Seriously. Is it a car? What's that about? A giant fish. Okay, what's next? See the guy in purple? He's a big shot among leftist. A militant? A photographer. Leftist paparazzi. Stachu. As Leader of RYS, I hereby issue a decree obligating you to bludgeon his head. Me? Ye. Now? Now. I'd do it myself, but it will be your baptism. Leftist scum. Go. I actually like baptisms. I think the Baptism of Poland was fucking dope. To a world without losers? I just gave you a swipe right. What do you say? That's nice, but I'm having a beer with my friend. - Hi. - I'm not interested in her. What was that for? As if you don't know. - Hey, thanks for your help. - What help? So humble. What was that about? That? Leftist scum. Judeo-Communism! I'm Pola. Stanisław. - Anka. - Stanisław. Stanisław... What's a Larysa? - What? - Larysa. Larysa? I dunno. A fish? Stanisław! Shouldn't you exchange your phone numbers now? Okay. Don't read my texts. It'd be hard with the cracked screen. Stanisław. Don't invite her to your place on the first date. Anka. See ya? Yeah. - Come on, let's go. - No! We're going. Fucking bastard. It's time to take real subversive action against the enemies of the fatherland. - Time for terror and violence. - Yeah. Like when we blew up Zglenicka's mailbox for chasing us out of her yard? - Great idea, Staszek. - What idea? We'll blow up the synagogue. We'll do what? Didn't you get that? We'll blow away the son of Gog. Time to prove that the Youth Society is truly radical. - Can Poland count on you? - Yes! Sure. We need new headquarters. Time to use our old contacts. Come in, boys. I planted these cedars when I got this parish. Linden. - Remember Kochanowski? "Oh, Guest..." etc. - Beautiful. Holy Mary... And this is my temporary earthly dwelling. - Come in. - Thank you, Father. - My boys. - Thank you. And this is our kitchen. Come in. Tea, coffee? Maybe coffee? These stairs are antique. As if to Heaven. Come on up. My boys. And this is the room I've told you about, boys. Here! We've got some hymnals. When the morning lights arise... On Tuesdays we have a choir practice. Join us. Roman, promise me it's going to be empty. No people. Promise. Sure, it'll be empty. Follow me. This is kind of a relaxation area. It warms my heart that we can help you. How long have we known each other? After all, the youth is the future of our nation. It's swell that there's action at the rectory. - You boys are swell. - Thank you. Also, to complete the formalities, what does your organization do? We... We promote family values, Father. - We oppose gender ideology, LPTB. - Pokémon. - Harry Potter. - Pope Francis. Avada Kedavra! And you can take a joke. Brilliant! It's a shame that there aren't more boys like you. - Bye. - God bless. POLA: 17? SEE YOU THEN Gotta go. Dad needs my help with the renovation. See ya. ...lights arise For Thee sing the Earth The sea and the skies For Thee sing all living beings... - After you. - Thank you. My treat. - Of course. - Of course? - I'm a guy. - Oh, that's right. And you provide for a poor woman who doesn't work and is raising two kids, having given up on her goals in high school? I was thinking four. I was away for a while. Now I'm back, and I'm suffocating. All these anti-Semitic tags on the walls... There was this survey, "What would you do if your child turned out to be Homo sapiens?" Half of the respondents said they'd kick them out. They get simple slogans and go with it, but all it takes is to look in their eyes and say, "Hey... you don't need this crap, hate is not the answer," before it's too late, and they start throwing parties for Hitler. Have you heard about that? - I've heard a bit. - There's no hope for those idiots. That's what all these fantasies about a great, national Poland lead to. Are you okay? Yes. Fuck. These pierogi are sweet. I know, right? Listen, can we change the subject? Sorry, I got worked up. Any suggestions? If you could go to space... and become the mother of a new planet, would you do it? Damn. Hell, yeah. Okay. What's your favorite color? - Yellow. - Yellow? - Okay. Dogs or cats? - Cats. - No way! - Always cats. - Only dogs. - Cats. No. Fine. Let it be cats. - What's your favorite movie? - Killer. What would you change your gender to? S'up! S'up. - Who are you? - Poland. - And you? - Also Poland. Where's Roman? What are we doing? Made in Poland. No, thanks. I already had some today. We must support Polish industry, local suppliers. Okay, what are we doing? Gentlemen! Come here! Assembly time! Sit down! - Do you know what that means? - Tee-cat, so "cat." Thanks to my channels I got in touch with an experienced Italian fascist terrorist. And? He's coming here! What for? To teach you draw a swastika. - Seriously? - No, not fucking seriously! To teach us how to build a bomb! - Howdy, boys. - Howdy. You've been up here so long, you're probably hungry. Thank you. Father... Charades. I used to love playing charades. Who'll guess this? A gazelle? - A woman? - Yes! Pierced with a knife? It's... A woman... A leftist woman? LTGB? The fall of white Europe? Romuś... Maybe it's too hard. A woman pierced with a knife is what? Stabbed? Yes, and the answer is: Stabat Mater. I used to show it better. - It was great. - Really. Very creative. Terrorist attack on a synagogue. Did I get it? I've still got it! Except... That's better. Eat up and have fun. Cheerio! Thank you. I dunno, maybe I'm dyslectic? Hey. Hello, Staszek. Where were you? None of your business. As long as you live under our roof, it is our business. - Sit down. - I'm working on it. Sit down. Is everything all right? Recently, we have been feeling that something bad is going on, that you're lost. You know, all these posters... We're worried that you fell in with the wrong crowd. You only meet up with boys. Son, you don't have any posters of girls. Haven't you heard of Pamela Anderson? - Who? - Claudia Schiffer? So you both think I'm gay? If you really must know, I was on a date. With a girl? - Obviously. Who else? - What's her name? - Pola. - Where did you meet? - At the bar. - How old is she? Hesitated. He's lying. - I don't know, 21? - What's her name? - You've already asked. - Magda? - Pola. - Paweł? Pola! For your information, Pola exists, and I think she likes me. But it doesn't matter because she's going to Warsaw, and I'll stay here with a hopeless job, a 15-year-old roommate, and an army of Asians on my walls. Happy? Is the interrogation over? Thank you very much. - Were you eavesdropping? - No. STANISŁAW SUŁKOWSKI WORKS AT A PARKING LOT. HE'S STILL KNOWN... ...ENDED BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN... YOUTH PICNIC YOUNG PATRIOTS PRAYED FOR THE HOMELAND. RESIDENT CONCERNED ABOUT THE NAZI SALUTES. Why is this synagogue unfrequented? You see, Jews in our country are smart enough to camouflage. They worship our God, pay taxes. They're model citizens. - Motherfuckers. - Yup! Hello? My name is Pola Ratajczyk. I'd like to talk to you. Listen, let's put on balaclavas, so she can't identify us. - But we're not hiding. - I don't want to risk it. Suit yourself. And let's not use our real names. Who knows what she's after? - You're jumpy, Staszek. - Sławek! I'm Sławek, okay? Sławek. - May I have a moment? - Please. My name is Pola Ratajczyk. Mieszko. Brajan. Mario. Roman Pisz, founder... and leader. That's Sławek over there. He has chickenpox. Take a seat. How may I help you? I'm writing a master's thesis about your organization. Bravo! What inspired you to establish RYS? I'd like to conduct a series of interviews with each one of you. That won't be necessary. Talking to me will suffice. Great. What's your aim? - Meaning? - What are your postulates? A free Poland. Is it not free now? Now it's too free. I mean, there must be freedom. But limited. God, Honor, Fatherland. - I think that explains it all. - That's right. God condones celebrating Hitler's birthday? God was white. - Was he, or maybe she? - Can't be. Then he would've impregnated Joseph, not Mary, right? I'd like to authorize this interview, yes? We have a meeting scheduled... - Meeting? What are you planning? - This isn't a university. I know. It's a rectory. Did you see how she was looking at me? - We have to keep an eye on her. - I'll handle it. Gentlemen, I have a message from our Italian friend. "See you tomorrow. I'm in Warsaw." - You know what that means? - He said "war." "This is war." This means... that our operation under the code name I haven't come up with yet, is entering its final phase. Watch this. - And? - Again. - Ready? - Just play. - Ouch! - What happened? - Ouch. - Show me. You know... Hey, come on! Pola! - That's not fair. Cheating. - You know what that means? - What? - That you've lost. You have to tell me something no one else knows. - There was no bet. - There was. - There wasn't. - A deal's a deal. - Give me the ball. - No. Well? For real? Never... Never have I ever... - Jeez. - Yeah? I've never... I've never seen The Lion King. What? - Why? - I dunno. Just never happened. Gosh, didn't your parents love you? My parents are dead. OMG, Staszek. I'm sorry. - It was a stupid joke, I'm so... - I'm kidding. Ouch! Now we're even. We are so watching The Lion King. - You're gonna cry. You'll see. - Guys don't cry. Everyone cries during The Lion King. Everyone. I love this song. Weird they'd play it here. - Why weird? - Come. No way. Nope. - Come on. - Guys don't dance. - Jeez, do guys do anything? - Pola... - Don't make me do this. - Please. Please... - I can't dance. - I'll teach you. - God, this is social suicide. - Nah. Sorry I'm late. He's not here yet? Relax. He'll be here soon. Where the fuck is he?! He'll be here soon. - I don't like bitches. - So you won't like each other. Hey, smart-mouth. Go fuck yourself. Hey, you! S'up, Brownie? Excuse me. It's 10 p.m. This is the evening news. Another ethnicity-based attack in Białystok... Turn it up. ...beaten up by unknown attackers. He is hospitalized in critical condition. The victim is a 35-year-old Italian citizen. Fuck. To the hospital! Aren't we waiting for the Italian dude? INTENSIVE CARE UNIT Our Italian. Bastards. Where were the police? Gentlemen, do you know what this means? This is the end of our plan. Operation code name "Blow up the synagogue" is called off. We really have to work on the code names. A man... chases his dreams, wants to do something good for the world... but no... Right. I need a puff. Is this a 24/7 hospital? Come, let's see if they sell smokes. NURSES ROOM Excuse me. Staszek. - Hi. - Hi. Jeez, it's awful. - I came as soon as I heard. - So did we. The entire Białystok Against Violence Association. ANTI-FASCISM He doesn't understand what's happened. Racial prejudice is abstract to him. Where were the police? I know you from somewhere. Impossible. Pola, let's go. He has to rest. I'll walk you home. - I never forget a face. - A match? Staszek used to play soccer. No, that's not it. Wait, I know! You work at the parking lot. Yeah, the parking lot. I never forget a face. Staszek, you don't understand. It's a serious problem. The worst part is that it'll only get worse. As a country, we need a new, comprehensive strategy. - We need Citizenship Education programs. - Yeah. Existing laws must be thoroughly analyzed. Do they provide the police and prosecutors the means to fight all these criminals? - This is so messed up. - Hold on, Pola. This is too much for me, I... Hey, easy. He'll come out of it, Staszek. It's not about him. I don't know how to say this. It's all fucked up. I think one thing, but do the other. Like I don't have my own opinion. - I've felt like trash my whole life. - You're not trash. Stachu, most men I've met are hypocrites. But there's something about you... that's damn real. Jeez. Pola, I made a mistake. You mean us? - I wanna tell you something, but I don't... - Me too. What about the propaganda? Jews own all of Hollywood, right? But Islamists? Jack shit. Bollywood. Not now, Brajanisław. I'm not in the mood. Don't sweat it, big guy. That synagogue was beneath you. Bro, don't you fucking get it? This is the end of RYS. Didn't you see Roman crying like a pansy? Fuck! I can't focus on my kebab with that "fafalaha fafaman." Turn it down, Turk. Turk! Turn it down, you're not at home! Didn't you fucking hear me? Turn it down! You're not at home! Where do you think I am then? In Poland! - Fucking take that! - What? Get the fuck up! Get up! Hi. Staszek! Where are you? At home. Come to the kebab shop! - White Poland... - Roman. ...Catholic... Listen, I don't think this is for me. I... If I ever was a member of RYS, I'm out now. Sorry. What?! Staszek, we're carrying out a coup at the kebab shop. The Turks stabbed Mieszko with a knife! What? This is serious! All members are to assemble in the t-shirts I gave you. Fight for your brothers! Fuck, Staszek! Can I count on you?! - What the fuck is this? - Mom washed it with my stuff. White Poland! - Your boyfriend's going to like it. - Give me that. White Poland! - Democracy, freedom, equality! - Let's squash these leftist parasites! No atheism and no rainbow! Catholic Poland, the way to go! - Democracy, freedom, equality! - Catholic Poland, the way to go! - White Poland! - Democracy, freedom, equality! SYRIAN KEBAB FIRAS' FOOD Fuck the commies! Better dead than red! - What's this? - Don't even ask. How's Mieszko? - We don't know. He's in the hospital. - Fuck the commies! Better dead than red! What a fucking mess! Fuck the commies! Better dead than red! - Who's got flares? - We're not scared! Fucking flares! Fuck the commies! Better dead than red! Democracy, freedom...! Better dead than red! Fuck LGBGQ! Roman! STOP VIOLENCE Pola! Pola, listen to me. - You son of a bitch. - I'm sorry. I really wanted to... To do what? Seduce me and make four little fascists? - What a plan! - I wanted to tell... - Throwing Hitler-themed kid parties? - Sorry... - You're a scumbag! - I tried... The worst, Brownshirt scumbag. - Pola, I'm really not like them. - You're not?! Why are you wearing a "white pride" t-shirt? Why were you at the kebab shop with them? You're like them, Staszek! Just like them! I can't believe I wanted to stay here! - Fuck! I even found an apartment! - Bullshit! - Excuse me? - Bullshit. - You'd never move here. - What do you mean? You say you hate hypocrisy. - But you are a hypocrite. - I'm a hypocrite? You moved to Warsaw and live a fantasy life! I live a fantasy life? You and your friends serve the Third Reich! Maybe I am like them! But you're like the other "them." All you have for us is contempt, fucking patronizing and ginseng! What fucking ginseng? Fucking Siberian. - You need help. - You need help! To abort your brain. - Go to a psych ward! - Yeah? And you... - If I wasn't handcuffed, I'd... - What?! I'm not fighting. It's cool. Here. Wait. I don't know how your mother raised you. - Dad... - We'll talk at home. I have to go back to work and listen to the jokes about my idiot son. - But you were scared that I was gay. - Stasiek. Only because you'd have a hard life. Because of people like your cousin. And you. Go home. A pink "white pride" t-shirt. Fucking awesome trolling. - Great idea. - It was my mom. - Well done, Mom. - The Warsaw Equality Parade is coming up. - Come. The more, the merrier. - Warsaw is fucked up. - True that. - Michał's number is on there. Call him! Take care! New friends? Show me. God is watching over us, Staszek! Mom's going to kill you. - Why are you helping me then? - Because mom's going to kill you. DELETE CONTACT Can't lose a finger here. Good. Fuck off! Go on, in the booth. For fuck's sake. Little shit. I can't believe it. Our Mieszko. May he rest in peace. What the fuck, Brajan? - He'll be out tomorrow. - Yeah, and he needs a peaceful rest. Nice haircut. You're starting to get it. Staszek, what's wrong? Nothing. Girl problems. Girls... are like the Red Army. They are many, they can't be trusted, and they're very dangerous in winter conditions. To cheer you up. Oh, you... Fuck, what is this? The best stuff. Local. Don't worry. Gentlemen. Things have taken a bad turn. We've all had moments of crisis... - Like when you cried? - I didn't cry. The enemy forces are drawing upon us. The attack on our Italian guy. The stabbing of Mieszko. The closures of churches in France. Those are signs that the leftist offensive has entered its final phase. We have to respond with double force. How, Roman? Without the handsome Italian? - And without Mieszko, may he rest... - Brajan. My cousin Staszek is a genius. Through subterfuge, he managed to convince the LGGTIQ circles that he's one of them. Now, Staszek is going to infiltrate their ranks and gain their trust. All right. Don't look at me like that. I'll go with Staszek. - Who's looking at you? - Roman, no need to ask me twice. Time to make critical decisions. You said so, right? If our cause demands it... I'll bend over. For Poland. Twice. All right, suit yourself. The deviants' meeting is today. Let's begin the infiltration. - Hiya. - Hi, come in. Listen, everyone. Hey! - This is... - Staszek. Staszek, the hero of yesterday's demonstration. - And you are? - I'm gay. I love it. Come in, make yourselves at home. - Hi. - Hi. - Karina. - Mariusz. Hi. Mariucha. Hiya, Mariucha. What are we doing? Okay. Fucking nada. You're right, it's amazing. See, I told you. Seitan. Did you know that Warsaw has the most veggie food joints in Europe? - I didn't know that. - Okay. Sickos. Did you see that guy with Staszek? Yeah. I don't get why he's with him. Staszek's fit, has a pretty face... And that meathead? Is it the '90s? Dolph Lundgren? What the... - What are you doing here? - What? I'm looking for HIV drugs. Are you sick? Listen the fuck up. You're the one's who are sick. Tough day? The other guys pissed me off. Men, bro. Who can understand them? Fuck those assholes. Fuck 'em. Everyone, listen up! Can I have your attention? I have great news. Due to the recent events in our city, the organizers of the Warsaw Equality Parade have just decided that our squad will have its own platform at this year's parade! They're inviting us to the platform. Excellent! We're going to the parade! Why did they want to meet here? I don't know, Roman, but these guys mean business. They're here. Relax, they're my soccer homies. S'up, Carp! Why the fuck did you choose this shithole? Carp, I'd like you to meet Roman, Leader of RYS and my friend. Commander. Cool tattoo. Where'd you get it? You got business with us? Or you want to complement our looks? We have business. I think we'll all agree that we have a problem with pansies. You hear that, Beast? He has a problem with pansies. No, not like that. Roman handles pansies like... a smooth operator. The thing is we're planning an attack. - On the pride parade. - But hush-hush. It's a secret. Yes, and we want to get in touch with the Russian mafia. Did you hear that? Hitler's birthday wafer boys are thugs now. They'll surprise the pansies and jump out of a cake. Or, wait for it, I had a good one... Shut up! Did you hear that, Beast? - Say that again. - No... Enough of this, for fuck's sake! You hate leftists and deviants. You know it's a plague that is destroying our nation. And what do you do about it? Nothing! You only have enough balls to put up banners at soccer games! But we, we are ready to do whatever it takes. And we will do whatever it takes to heal this country! And we won't be stopped by your squad or the police. Not even by God Almighty in the Holy Trinity himself! Now give me your contact list. How does it go? There was trembling in the air On a hot summer day I don't know how I caught your trail On a hot summer day And that was when I first met you On a hot summer day I knew you liked me too On a hot summer day On a hot summer day On a hot summer day There were shooting stars in the sky On a hot summer day We managed to stop the time... Did you know that being wounded with a kebab knife you might've caught Islam? Very funny, Brajanisław. We have to fill up. Not here. That's an Israeli company. Nope. They support LDGL. Here? At a German gas station? Fuck. Now what? Nothing. You go. All right then. - You win. - Fine, I'll go. Poland is beautiful, isn't it? Hey! Welcome, gentlemen. - Glory... - To Great Poland. How are you, lunatic? Or should I say, Deputy Minister? One does not exclude the other. - Counter-demonstration? - Yup. - That'll burn? - Yup. I must say, I kind of miss the old times, throwing cobblestones. So many beautiful memories. - Fuck it. Quid pro quo, right? - Yeah. Romek, you have a room in my name. It's top-notch. Hi, guys. - Thanks. - See ya. How do you know him? He's an old buddy, back from the Youth Movement. He was mental! And now? There you go. - Come in! - Come in! - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Good afternoon. Refreshments. On the house. What's this? Stones? These are clams. Grab some glasses. Here. Fucking hell! The night before the op. We're lying low like soldiers. - We're out of champagne. - I'll get it. - No! - No! I'll go. How did you forget to put on your briefs? DEATH TO THE ENEMIES OF THE FATHERLAND Our vigil is over. Time to sleep. Tomorrow morning we launch operation code name "Blowing up the gay bus which..." You know which one. In the morning, before people arrive. Not quite. Not quite... Because? Because we'll blow it up once they're there. You want to kill people? They're not people. They're an ideology. Have you lost your fucking minds? Tell me you're kidding. Fuck, Roman! This wasn't the plan. Staszek, are you the commander? You're fucking mental. I'm off. Staszek, snort a line. You're not thinking straight. I've just fucking straightened up. You're my family. My blood. That's why I'll say this one more time. Staszek, get a grip! In RYS there's no place for weakness. We don't retreat backwards. You can only retreat backwards. - Not in RYS. - Hey, Roman. What the fuck? What's happened to you? What are you getting me into? Don't you think it upsets your cousin when you say stuff like that? One person might say, "Kill the deviants," someone else, "Don't kill the deviants." A civil discussion, no insults. I saved your life, you ingrate. - Fuck! Roman, it's not too... - I've opened your eyes! - Sit and stop embarrassing yourself! - You're the embarrassment, clown! - We're blowing that parade the fuck up! - Look at yourself! Who have you become, Roman? You're a fucking old man with nothing but hatred inside. A self-proclaimed admiral and leader! You've hit rock bottom, and you're pulling us with you! Fuck that! This is not fighting for your brothers. You're mentally ill. Let me through. Out of my fucking way. Clock that fucking LGBTIQ-lover. Darlings, hello! I'm happy to see you all!

Polaris, can you explain who this Staszek is who's calling you? No, hang up. Just hang up. Call the police. The police. Stanisławix. You talk too much. And it's high time that we, men, stop talking and start listening. Shut the fuck up. Call the police. Roman has a bomb. He wants to detonate it. Fuck, people will die. Call the police. - He hung up. - What did he want? Call. Call the police. Fuck, no. He said something about some Roman, the parade, a bomb and... he's in the Department of the Interior's suite. Polaris... Who do you hang out with? HERO OF TOLERANCE It's great that so many of you could make it. The Parade will start in half an hour! Love! Three times love! And remember! You're all safe here... BIAŁYSTOK SUPPORTS LGBTQIA+ ...because love is on our side! An attack on the Equality Parade? Ma'am, I don't know why people flaunt about what they do in bed, but this is the 12th call today about a bomb at the parade. Sir, I'm not kidding. They'll blow it up. Okay, got it. Have a nice day. Where's the Department of the Interior's suite? - Hello. - Hello. We're looking for five weird guys. We have only weird ones here. - Room 118. - Thanks! ...the octopuses and divide them. We'll divide them into easily... Easily fried various pieces. So soft. It was frozen... Where's Staszek? - What's wrong? Need a push? - Who the fudge knows? Darlings! SOLIDARITY Raise your flags! Big and small, all of them! Warsaw is free and safe today! So remember, and let me remind you! - Love! - Love! I SLEEP WITH WHO I WANT!!! Fuck. Where's our bus? Let's fire up our rockets and go! Fucking deviants. Try now! Fucking gay bus. Wait, I'll check the alternator! Bro, what alternator! Terminals have oxidized. - What terminals? - Terminals. You're all dirty. LOVE We can check the terminals. Fuck. What's up? Staszek escaped, and he's coming for you. What? It was that snooping leftist girl. Fucking hell! How did it happen? We grab the tongs from underneath, like that. A Jewish conspiracy. Fuck! What's up? Here. Find the bus and blow it up. Now you're the brains of this operation. And remember the detonation code is... ...zero! - Grunwald! - Grunwald. Where are you going? To deal with Staszek. Once and for all. - Are you coming? - In a minute. Okay. Grunwald... Fuck me sideways. Gru... "G" is a six. Fuck, that's not it. Fucking Grunwald. - Hey, you. - Yeah? - Do you know zip code for Grunwald? - Nope. Neither do I... Okay, thanks. Try to get the detonator! Stop! - Gimme that! - Let the fuck go! Stop! Let me go! Calm down or I'll smack you! Let go! Give it back to him. - Why didn't you detonate the bomb? - You said Grunwald, but it has digits! - The date of the Battle of Grunwald! - You enter it. Hold this. People, run! They have a bomb! Too late. Poland is beautiful, isn't it? Wrong date? - Police! Hands up, now! - Hands in the air! Hands! Gentlemen, it's not a bomb. It's a Hindu symbol of luck. - Relax! - Put me the fuck down! Calm down or I'll smack you! - Calm down! - Fuck! Look! I disarmed it. We have to get this out of here. Looking for someone? Great fourth date. We got them good, huh? Come on. Hello? Are you packed? Almost. You? Tell me. Not just "you." I have a Master degree now. Really? Okay, Master! Thesis, "Ethnic composition of Białystok across the centuries" defended summa cum laude. I knew you could do it. Gotta go. I have a train to catch. Bye! Love you! Bye! You really prefer to live with Pola than with me? Come here, you little goth rebel! Stop it! Now, all of this will be yours. I understand that the defendant pleads guilty to all charges. Moreover, he states that he acted alone, and participation of the other defendants stemmed out of their unawareness caused by the defendant's manipulation. Therefore, the defendant wishes to take all the blame on himself because he was, as he put it, "the brains of the operation." Does the defendant agree? - Sure do. - Excuse me? Yes, Your Honor. All right, I hereby officially open the staff meeting of a new force. The Polish Youth. Now, the first order of business. The rector complains that someone's been stealing soap from the bathroom. Fucking hell, Krystian. Do you know anything about that? Wojtas... I mean, Deputy Minister. It's Minister, now. A Deputy Minister is someone I need. Me? All that happened doesn't matter? Youthful indiscretions. Clean yourself up. Subtitle translation by: Maja Konkolewska
