NARRATOR: In the last episode of Thundercats, Mumm-Ra conjured up the samurai warrior Hachiman, and tricked him into a fight with Lion-0. Meanwhile, Lion-O had grown weak, trying to cross the Thundranium Pits to save his Thunderian friends when Hachiman stepped into his path. No. I-- I can't fight you. I must obey. [GRUNTING] HACHIMAN: No! Take hold of the bridge, Lion-O san. I can't, Hachiman. Slipping. No, I will help you. You, Lord Lion-0? You were so frightened, you could not move? I cannot believe this. Down there are Fire Rocks, Hachiman. What we call Thundranium. It weakens Thundercats, takes our strength. And knowing that, you came on the bridge to save me? Because you are my friend. Mumm-Ra has lied! My samurai ancestor would never demand that I destroy a friend. The code of Bushido forbids it. I am a fool. You couldn't have known, Hachiman. Mumm-Ra's evil has no limit. I am shamed, Lion-O san. Allow me to help you. I ask humbly. I can make it now, Hachiman. Thank you. If this bad place means doom for Thundercats... ...why do you come here? The mutants have prisoners here in their stronghold. Mumm-Ra's orders. We must free them. They are friends of the Thundercats, these prisoners? Yes. Countrymen. The Fire Rocks hold no terror for Hachiman. I will rescue these prisoners for you. No, you can't do it alone, Hachiman. HACHIMAN: While a warrior still has his sword... ...he is never alone. [MUMM-RA YELLING] Hachiman saw through my trick. Even so, the Thundercats haven't a chance. Still... Captain Shiner. Yes, Mumm-Ra? What now? The Thundercats are converging upon Fire Rock Mountain. Seek and destroy them. I tire of this game, Mumm-Ra. The price will be high. Name your price and it is yours. Very well, Mumm-Ra. Switch on the space scanners. Fire Rock Mountain ahead, Tygra. Almost there. Yes. Cheetara, 10 o'clock high! Captain Shiner, Thundercat ships. Tiny little things. Oh, well. Attack. CHEETARA: The Vertus, Captain Shiner's ship. TYGRA: And he's seen us. Look, Tygra, an air lock. With the Thunderclaw's capabilities maybe I can board the Vertus. Go for it, Cheetara. I'll try to find some other way in. I've lost them, captain. Where'd they go? Maintain the search. They can't escape the space scanners. Hey, a Thundercat. And now you're weaponless. But not friendless. Just in time, Tygra. Grab that one, Cheetara. You'll never get off this ship alive, Thundercats. We got in, we'll get out. Same odds. Well, they've obviously gone. Yes, they must be a hundred miles from here by now. We can relax. TYGRA: Think again, Shiner. Ah! Thundercats. How--? I wouldn't if I were you. TYGRA: Set it for straight up, Cheetara. Full throttle. Full throttle? But-- But we'll be light-years away, in deep space, in seconds. TYGRA: Sorry we can't join you, Shiner. SHINER: No. You can't do this. CHEETARA: Ten seconds to blastoff, Tygra. TYGRA: Let's move. We won't be seeing Captain Shiner for a while. But he's cost us time. Hurry. There's the ship, captain. The ship! Yeah. Arr! And we blasted near had to cross the ocean to catch up to it. SNARF: Snarf. The Berserkers got their ship back. TURMAGAR: I'm sorry, friend Snarf... ...but this Gomplin couldn't pull it any further. Oh, gosh. You know, we've asked too much of the poor fellow already. But now Hammerhand will be heading back to Fire Rock Mountain... ...to recapture our friends, the Thunderians. The Gomplin is willing to try to stop them. That's awfully brave of him, Turmagar, but-- Attack, Gomplin! WILYKAT: Look, Wilykit! Turmagar! And that's Snarf with him. They look like they're getting ready to attack Hammerhand's ship. On the Gomplin? Oh, wow, Wilykat. Hammerhand, it's back, it's back! That thing that towed our ship out to sea. It's back! Back! Yarr! Blast it out of the sky. Now, now! [GOMPLIN SCREAMS] The Gomplin! He's been hit, Turmagar. [GOMPLIN SCREAMS] The Gomplin! He's been hit, Turmagar. No, I-- I think he's just singed, but-- WILYKAT: Snarf! Turmagar! -Get out of the line of fire! WILYKIT: We'll take over! Snarf. Just in time. Now you can get back home and take care of the Gomplin, Turmagar. But how will you get to Fire Rock Mountain, friend Snarf? Just drop me on shore. I'll find my way there. Can't see through this.... This-- [SNEEZES] Can't stop itching. Itching. Keep firing. We can't match their firepower, Wilykat. No, but maybe if we use all of our firepower at once. Put all your pellets in your pouch, Wilykit. They're coming back. Arr! Keep firing. Wilykat! WILYKAT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. WILYKIT: Whoa! [MONKIAN GIBBERING] I'm waiting for you, Panthro. [MONITOR BEEPING] PANTHRO: Looks like I'm expected. Well, no other way to go but straight ahead. MONKIAN: There's the ThunderTank. But where's Panthro? Hey! Hope that's the last I see of that rig. Thundercats, here comes Panthro. Ho! Arr! They're getting away. Berserkers, fire. Fire. Wait, what--? What's that? It's coming right at us. Rocket power. Full astern. BOTH: Thundercats, here we come! Ho! All present, Lion-O. [CACKLING] [YELLS] Mumm-Ra. Defend yourself, evil one. You have betrayed me. LION-O: Hachiman. What has Mumm-Ra done to him? JAGA: Hachiman is safe, Lion-O. -Jaga! He is back in his own time, in his own dimension. I'm glad to hear that, but we've failed. There's nothing more we can do. JAGA: There is something, Lion-0. The Star of Thundera. It can render the Thundranium harmless to you. Then I must have it. How can I get it, Jaga? I will try, Lion-O. I will try.... The Star of Thundera. The greatest power in the universe. If the Thundercats use it against me, I'm done. No one can stop Jaga... ...except another of his kind. Possibly Jaga's ancient enemy... ...Grune the Destroyer. The Star of Thundera. -Grune. -Yes, Jaga, old friend. Stand aside. I have no time for you. But there's always time to settle old scores, Jaga. You have only to get past me to reach the Star. A fight, Jaga. A fair fight. What do you say? The Black Planet! Yes, Jaga. You're caught in its gravitational force... ...being drawn into its hideous black center... ...from which nothing can escape. Not even mighty Jaga! No! [GRUNE SCREAMING] I'm being drawn back... ...by the Star of Thundera. Star of Thundera... ...since you saved me, you must know of the Thundercats' mission. Will you grant us the use of your power so that the mission can be completed? Good. LION-O: The Star gave us its power? Not "gave," Lion-O. Power is never a gift, but a responsibility. Yes, Jaga. Wear this Talisman and the Thundranium will not harm you. Go, bring back our countrymen. Good luck, friend. Wait, the way out is that way. There? But that's where the Thundranium is, Lynx-O. Even so, Bengali, we must go that way if we are to save ourselves. Lynx-O has been right so far. Let's hope this gives him a perfect score, Pumyra. The Thunderians. Throw them into the Fire Rock pit. Look! The Thundercat. Thunderians, ho! Well, sure doesn't seem like you needed any help. Quickly, join hands. If you maintain contact with me, the Thundranium can't harm you. He has the power of the Star of Thundera around his neck. It must not be. Ancient spirits of evil... ...transform this decayed form... ...to Mumm-Ra, the ever-living! WILYKAT: Okay. Come on. WILYKIT: We'll help you. TYGRA: You made it. -Look out. Mumm-Ra! -He got the Talisman. MUMM-RA: The Star of Thundera! The greatest power in the universe... ...is mine, mine alone! [CACKLING] No, Mumm-Ra. You mustn't open the talisman! MUMM-RA: You tell me what I must and must not do? Mumm-Ra, who now rules the universe? I don't see Mumm-Ra, Jaga. Has the Star of Thundera destroyed him? Perhaps, as all who seek such power are ultimately destroyed. It belongs to the universe alone. -It's over, then? -Not quite. There's still Ratar-O to deal with for what he did to the ThunderTank. No need for that, Panthro. Ratar-O's ship has been disabled. Congratulations, Snarf! -You're a true Thundercat after all. SNARF: Snarf. Come, friends, let's get back to the Lair. We've got some celebrating to do. Thundercats. ALL: Ho! Lynx-O, Pumyra, Bengali, make yourselves at home. -Cats' Lair. -Just as it was on Thundera. -We haven't thanked you. -Especially you... ...and you haven't even told us your name. You are standing before Lion-O, Lord of the Thundercats. -How did you know, Lynx-O? -I hear your father's voice in yours. I could not mistake it. -You knew my father? -Everyone knew him. You must tell me about him. I was just a child when we lost Thundera. I will tell you gladly, when we visit here. Visit? But you'll be living here, all of you. -In Cats' Lair? -On Thundera... ...the lair was only for Thundercats. Well, you've handled yourselves like Thundercats... ...and once I've anointed you, you'll be true Thundercats. What say all of you? CHEETARA: Of course. TYGRA: Thundercats one and all. WILYKAT & WILYKIT: Yo! Welcome to Third Earth. Thundercat Lynx-O. Thundercat Pumyra. Thundercat Bengali. Brother. Thunder, thunder, thunder. ALL: Thundercats, ho!
