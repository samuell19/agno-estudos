How did this blast take place? What were you doing there at that time? Hey... Sir.. sir. What are that questions when they are in pain Mr. Reddy? Do they have no common sense? More than the commercials coming before and after news, there would be commerciality in news here Sir Sir, he is the state Home Minister and the one beside is the Health Minister Sir, how do you respond to the blast that took place? This is an act by the terrorists. I am condemning this I am declaring an ex-gratia from the Government for 10 Lakhs for the dead and 5 Lakhs for the wounded in the blast I am praying to God that all these should recover fast Sir, what is your opinion about that blast?

Not just the business, but we are also leaving India What for? Unable to take this public service Why so much pain for you? I am doing service with the money given by my dad Do not talk foolish. It is not about yours or mine. If the same money is invested in business, it multiplies God blessed us financially not just to raise our standards, ...but to raise our standards of giving They are good on walls to read We are leaving India tomorrow and that is it I understood Anand. You may take me away from the Ashram but not from my ambition From the time I stepped in this trust, I feel am closer to mom Tilak Sir We are very happy for you to have come here. Soul of your mother will be at peace Our own children said us to leave saying they cannot bear us We are living here with the mercy of that Goddess Sir, we are all in good positions today into various professions.

By the way, how are the victims who joined in your hospital that day? No idea sir, it is been long since all those are discharged Discharged, how can that be done? Seeing those, I felt it may take minimum 6 months for them to recover It will take Sir, but they should have money to get the treatment, right Sir? Ministers that day said Government will bear all the expenses for treatment right? It is common here sir, they make announcement to give money but never the money Why not your hospital take it up? That is a corporate hospital Sir. There will be value for money but not for a human Sir Where would all those be now? - No idea Sir Mr. Reddy, I want to see all of them right now If you do not go, dad will... Mr. Reddy, it is my order Sir, when I asked our staff to check the hospital records I came to know that few from the victims are from this locality Sir, what do we say if these ask who we are? Say we came from Durgadevi Charitable Trust How long will you cultivate in a barren land, father? Saying so, he asked me to come down to city so that he would take care, brought me here And now... he is in a position that I should take care of him He's gone dumb and also deaf, it's almost costing 10000 for medicines per month We sold out all the lands we had. All the Ministers came and said Government would take care There's none who cared about us till date He used to earn a thousand everyday doing the painting work Someone planting a bomb there and he getting into this position, it's our bad time Iron pieces pierced into the head during that blast Sir He can't talk as the brain is damaged He can't identify anybody. They said Government would give 5 Lakhs, they haven't at least padi the hospital bill Sir Her name is Vaibhavi Sir, state level running champion After it happened, we've been roaming for Government help Sir When gone to Minister, they ask for a paper. When gone to Government office they say verification should be completed There are hundreds like me waiting for the help Sir Look, bring 25000 and I'll get you the compensation amount of 1,50000 you should get What's it Sir, Minister sir said Five Lakhs Oh no, Minister;s share itself in that is 3 Lakhs and 25000 for his PA That money is what fixed by Government to the dead body of my husband broken into pieces. Do you take shares even in that? Are you any humans? You keep cursing so and 1,50,000 will become one Lakh Agriculture anyways is not going good. Thinking would at least get help from the Government, my dad drank pesticide brother Minister Sir said to give Ten Lakhs and it's been six months All the money I had are spent over for bus fares only bro Please give me fifty rupees bro, I am very hungry Please brother Sir, for the ex-gratia amount of my sister Hey, one must go to College, come home and study It happens so going around park and restaurant with boyfriend Enjoy now please Sir... Hey, leave Sir, do not let injustice happen to my sister Sir Public are at loss and the compensation is going to the politicians Common man will not get the help unless the system of ten people signing for one to get help changes No problem even if one doesn't clear the problem, but the thought to cash that problem... We shall kill that Mr. Reddy More than half from these would die not getting a help by the time change you wish for come in the system, How many would be the bomb blast victims in total? Total three bomb blasts took place in row that day Sir. Those dead, hurt and adding up the victims in similar incidents before, what tens and hundreds Sir? They would be in thousands Prepare that list. I'll bear the amount required for their treatment But it's not enough giving treatment to just these, Mr. Reddy. We must give treatment to the total system I'll give a shock treatment Their lives are not cost about the cost of your wrist watch Even your mom was the same. She was on the same job round the clock saying donations, service and charity Same blood right, you started it again Ok, let that be gone. I'll reschedule appointment once your mood is set How much more long will you think with mind dad? Just think once with heart So many thousands of Billions wouldn't be with us today, if I listen to the heart. Surana group of Industries wouldn't be in this position Moreover being the MD of this company, you made a mistake When a business man gives donation, it should either be for some publicity stunt or for a tax exumption But, you gave it to a corrupt Politician Hey, what are you writing here without bothering when I'm talking here? You said it right dad, that I'm unfit as MD of this Company. I'm thus resigning If I get them treated with my money, it's a help. If I make them get back the looted money from Ministers and MLAs, that is justice I'll come back again after giving them justice along with the help I did a lot to you as a son, dad. Now, time has come to do for mother Good Sir flash back of him is great Mr. Tilak... when I am looting hundreds of crores here Sir is looting thousands of crores from me What is this account? Looting the same money from you, formed a network with the students studying in this same trust and Vikranth Suarana has made it possible that any person across the state being victimized is getting the ex gratia The people who has to do service are doing scams and Vikranth Surana to do business is doing service Thanks Mr. Tilak you said it with a great clarity It took us two months to meet that Anand Surana No idea how long would it take for us to meet this thief Surana Hey, see it might be him Oh no...!

What the hell all this is Party got very bad name because of you Prove that you are right or else resign from the post What did CM say? Did he say to resign? I know it. I know in advance that the situation will lead here If you talk too much by-election will come up in your constituency Wait Nayak, forget about him and look about those summons first I know what to do very well. I will do... Sir.. A small adjustment No barracks are vacant, so all the prisoners tonight will stay in your cell You anyways will not be there by morning right? I mean, you got to go tomorrow for the adjournment right? Hey, we asked Sir for adjustment Do not trouble him, ok? Sir, they are well trained criminals... by this time they might have finished him Hey, put the phone at the ear If I put my focus on him even if the whole Police force under him comes cannot stop his death Ask him to stop all such crazy things and to attend for court tomorrow Raheem zoom the camera home minister has come Is it a courage that you can escape being a politician in power Sir? The confidence that court never does a mistake Confidence shouldn't be on the court but on the lawyer arguing our case Is he strong enough? Have you heard the name Sharat Khelkar? That man who brought our Central Minister out from the corruption case? Yes him, but the fees are 20 Lakhs For the case? - No.. per hour Start the proceedings This is not any new story to say Sir The story we have been saying from when the nation is born Corruption! Whichever party may be in power in the nation the power is of corruption Sir There was a serial bomb blast a few months back in Hyderabad Sir Taking the public in the bloodshed and in the form of flesh lumps these same Ministers have declared ex gratia, pricing per dead body and the organs lost before this same media Only the announcements were there but compensation has never come Not just the bomb blast Sir when a flyover collapses, when there is a train or bus accident taking place, floods or cyclones come and even when farmers commit suicide with crop failures, ex gratia is not reaching them properly Sir Such delays take place due to administrative procedures We all know that problem How this relates to our case? Ask him to come to the point first your honor That is the whole point your honor It is not an administrative delay it is a blatant corruption How did the cheque I gave as donation in the hospitals where victims were admitted on the day of bomb blast deposit into a benami account in Mumbai Sir? When I pulled out details about that account, the total scam has fallen out The master mind behind the thousands of crores scam on the name ex gratia is our Home Minister Jayendra alias Nayak These Minsters have formed a syndicate with the help of a few Government officers and the money they hid with Nayak was looted by me and I made that reach the victims through Durgadevi Charitable Trust Sir I submitted all the cheques, bank vouchers, hospital bills and everything related to that to the court Sir You can also see the current position of the victims Sir Happy journey Sir.. Thankyou sir.. Story of Robinhood is very good Sir But if he had shown a proof that the money was of my client, it would have been much better I have the proof Sir What is this It is truth what Vikranth Sir said, Sir. we are benami of Nayak When Nayak tried killing us in the anger to have lost the money, Vikranth Sir saved us Your honor, what they are saying is a lie These two were once employees under me Knowing that they were misusing funds I had filed a Police case and dismissed them both from their jobs And now keeping that in mind they are talking like that That is all, your honor witnesses have no character and credibility To convict anyone in the court of law you need flawless collaborative evidence which excatly they do not have. Sir, see the video evidence I submitted to the court once Sir Nayak Bhai... Shut up, I have not put that name to be called But to hide my money with benami fellows like you My blood too is boiling by seeing the video your honor I feel nothing wrong in giving any punishment to such a person You and the public watching this video before coming to a decision, please watch this video for once I got the reputation as a leader is to serve the public and not to cover your corruption I will dismiss you both. That video is a fake sir They are trying to cheat the court by changing the audio from the original video Exactly Sir, what we are saying too is the same This is the latest technology today. They have faked videos of even Obama and Mark Zuckerbeg What would be a big problem in changing the voice of my client Sir? If these two videos are sent to Govt. Forensic lab It will be known which is real and which is fake It is not any big difficulty for the state Home Minister to manipulate a lab report Sir They will manage it all in one night What is this Mr Vikranth, You looks to be tensed with a feeling that truth will fall out Shall I say the real story? Your honor, this story has started 25 years back His mother is a good visionary She has established this Durga Devi Trust 25 years back itself He will loot the country in the name of business In the name of charity she will transfer the money to overseas. The whole process is Hawala sir... Please show some respect to the people who are no more Life is gone by dying but where will the sin go I will say why is he doing all this? My client had been to meet my client in regards with the investment of Surana industries in the state He had shown the greed of thousands of crores as a bribe In return he asked to allot 10 thousand acres of SEZ land to his company My client did not agree Thus blackmail my client and the government politically and they did all this to get their work has to done Look at my clinet once Though he is accused with false alligations with the trust he has on the judiciary system He is sitting in the court innocently I thought why when he said 20 Lakhs per hour, but we can be given more. Kindly dismiss this case Seize Durgadevi Charitable trust. Put CBI enquiry on its activities That's all your honour Thank you Ordering the Police Department to send these two videos to Government Forensic lab and Give a report on it I am ordering to carry out a CBI enquiry on the activities of Durgadevi Charitable Trust Court is adjourned for next hearing You'd have been happy if dead in the jail in the hands of my men I'll make you feel to have done a mistake by being alive Hey, bring that CBI officer enquiring about that trust to me Let's shut down that trust permanently so now you know the truth Now call the CBI officer who enquired this case Show that report to the people too... Last time when we asked him to find who is behind this he went off by showing a wrong report will he give us a favourable report now Sir has given a serious warning that such mistake should not repeat. There will not be a difference this time The enquiry report I carried out about the trust is before you Sir I am testifying under oath Your Honour... All the allegation that came up on that trust are... Are mere lies Sir Another meaning to selfless service is that trust your honor You said no difference will come? It hit back somewhere Sir What Vikrant said was true your honor, that money belongs to these Coincidentally, the man appointed by Nayak to catch the guy looting that money was again me Sir Sir, I object it Please, let him continue I have a hearing problem Sir Thus I record every conversation Sir I have every voice call record of the conversation I and Nayak had One copy related to that is before you Sir Even the recording is there... Home Minister agreeing that Vikranth looted his money Sir,this is all by mimicry artistes. 100 of such recordings can be done I know in advance that you would ask this question Sir. Along with the report by voice expert stating that the voice in that record is of Nayak there is also the report given by Government Forensic lab on the top Sir Why did you called me here? I had a doubt from very long time To clarify that Though you know that i had made all the robberies may i know why did you give the wrong report to Nayak 10 years back when i was on duty my ear got damaged in a landmine blast I know the difficulty in living with a physical defect I don't get connect with anything except but i got connected for your cause I may be corrupt but I am committed I broke my commitment for the first time by giving a wrong report on you That day you got connected to my cause and gave a wrong report Now that cause itself is in danger sir If a daily wager gets fever, he buys a tablet worth of 2 rupees In that government collects 2 paisa as tax. the salary you are getting monthly is paid from that tax only sir You are so committed for a person who bribes you then how much committed you should have towards the people who are paying you monthly as a salary Kurukshetra will occur only once in the history To stand beside the Justice or beside the injustice you have to decide that time itself sir. When a person without any relation is striving so hard to clean this system I felt it is incorrect not to do our duty taking salary and wearing the uniform Sir That is why I came to the court along with the evidence against to Nayak That is all, your honor I thought we will use him but he was used by him. Say now Sir Two years back he gave the affidavit to election commission that Home Minister's whole property is 28 lakhs Where did he got so many thousands of crores Sir? Leave all of them for now, he himself has agreed to have done robbery First give him the punishment Sir Hey, it is not a crime to be punished. I looted that money to prove that corruption was going on As per the whistle blowers act 2011, I should be protected and not prosecuted by the law Hey, what are you talking about all sections? If you mess with our leader, we shall do protests and bandhs and burn the whole city Hey, you should not get angry and show anger on me Seeing the ditch at every yard on the yard you walk, you should get anger over the leader you have elected When the street light does not glow, when the garbage is full all over the street, when humans are treated worst than animals in Government hospitals when a bribe is asked at every step in the Government office, you should get the anger Why does none get anger for all such things? But when a leader doing corruption is arrested, saying to do protests, bandhs and burn busses every guy comes on to the roads Hey, he is looting your food, life and your future If you face some unexpected risk by chance, they do a scam and loot even that exgratia You said it correctly Sir. A common man like me is facing so many problems here because of corruption Common man in this country is not any clean brother, he is most corrupted part of the system There is more corruption in the voter who votes than the politician in power When said to give a house for free, free current, loan waivers and to give 5000 per vote he votes without thinking anything about good and bad and if he asks for a society without corruption, where would that come from? For a country to change or the corruption to be gone, common man should first change. You should change Order, order! We will change Sir But if they are punished in this court, they would go to the higher court They manage everything and come out again What will you say for that Sir? If they escape punishment at the upper court, you give the answer in the public court Every politician should know he would not get a deposit in election if his deposits grow in the Swiss Bank Order, order! To block corruption there are vigilance commission Anti Corruption Bureau and many more as such, What more to do for stopping corruption? Amazon, Flipkart or E-Bay... When we order an item anywhere online, we get a message in half a second about when it gets delivered Sir Transaction happens in the next second in PayTM when we press the send button When there is such technology available why an outdated system of files, affidavits, signatures and certificates If not to trouble the common man... For a victim to receive ex gratia why the involvement of so many is required from a Minister to Collector MRO, Revenue Inspector, Office clerk other than to share their money and increase properties Sir Can the Government asking to link Aadhar even to talk on phone why dont they ask to link the same for victims and give the ex gratia amount directly? When Durgadevi Charitable trust with 32 employees could do the job, why is this Government having thousands of employees not able to do that your honor? losing their own and body parts Sir None in this country should ever take a trouble again to move around the Government offices for the ex-gratia money People gave you power not to enhance your wealth but to empower their lives I am, retiring tomorrow had never expected to get a chance to give such a historic judgment I declare Nayak, other Ministers and the officers involving into the scam as convicts and order the speaker and the officers in relation to remove them from their posts immediately As said by Vikranth, I recommend the Government to disperse the ex-gratia amount in the direct transfer method You are being discharged in the evening. Pay the bill at the counter and take the clearance letter You should get money from Government, did you got it? Sir, excuse me Sir business call from UK I am in a work Ask him to call later -Okay Sir.
