And I'll have Nell help prepare the feasibility report. - Right. - Where is Nell? - She was right behind me. - Look what I found! - What is that? - It's a keystone. All these old buildings have them. - It has the initials of the couple that had the house built as well as the year Christmas, 1893. - How do you know all that? - I grew up in a small town upstate. It dates back to the 1800s. We had quite a few of these. I think the whole building is worth saving. I just walked around every inch of it and the foundation looks solid so it could be restored. We can call it an adaptive reuse. That way, we can retain the historical integrity as well as add some modern amenities. - That's a lovely speech, but as you well know, that's not what this firm does. - That doesn't mean we can't offer it as an option, does it? - Nice try. But this building is coming down. It's what the client wants. Let's go! ♪ Jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ - Merry Christmas! Yes, thank you so much. Have a good day. Thank you.

It fell in when I was making a donation. Do you expect anyone to believe that? - You must be a very cynical person. - No, just an everyday New Yorker. - What's going on over here? - This young lady was just dipping into your donation pot. - Oh I doubt that. Nell leaves a donation almost every day. - You know her? - I think Santa made that perfectly clear. My bracelet fell in. - Oh. Here you go. - Thank you, Santa. Next time have a little more faith in people. It is Christmas, after all. - I'm sorry. - Merry Christmas! - Nell? Charles wants to see you in his office. - Do you know what it's about? - No. But you shouldn't look so worried. - Hi Charles. You wanted to see me? - Come in. Please get the door. - Okay. - Good morning, Nell. - Good morning. - I'm taking you off the brownstone project... Because I'm putting you on a different project instead. It's a remodel of an old theater. Actually it will be more than just a remodel... But at least it's not a tear down, which I know you have issues with. - For the record, I don't think all old buildings should be saved. - I'm glad to hear that, because the project is actually happening in your home town. - The Majestic in Briar Falls? - That's the one. The new owner is closing it down to turn it into a multiplex. - But the Majestic has been the centerpiece for the town's Christmas Pageant for decades! - They'll have to find another venue. - That's like asking the Rockettes to move out of Radio City Music Hall. - What makes it so special? - It's magic. The whole town gets involved. Lots of people on stage and back stage, and there are live performances, and the centerpiece is this huge Christmas tableau. It's like this living work of art where people literally recreate paintings or cards, or a Christmas scenes. - Unfortunately the new owner doesn't share your sentiment. And I have no idea what you're talking about. - The Playhouse has theater all year round. Granted, it's not Broadway, but it's our community theater. - I understand your enthusiasm for your town's history, but I hope this project isn't going to be a problem for you. - No, no, it's not a problem. I'm very grateful for the opportunity that you have given me, I promise I won't let you down. - Good.- When is the Playhouse scheduled to close? - Right after Christmas, so I'll need some preliminary drawings before the office closes for the holidays. - Of course. - Great. I'm sure you'll do a fine job. Yes? Nell? The client is here. Please show him in. Connor! - Charles! - Great to see you. This is Nell Harper. She'll be the point person on the Majestic. She's excellent. - We've already met. - Briefly. - But it was memorable. - It certainly was. - And humbling. - Am I missing something? - No. - Excuse me. Charles, you're needed in the conference room. - Now? - Yes. - Would you excuse me? - Of course. That was an apology, by the way. - I appreciate that. And I suppose I could have been nicer to you with Santa and everything, given it's Christmas. - How about we start over? Hi, I'm Connor Martin. It's very nice to meet you. - Lovely to meet you, Connor. I'm Nell Harper. Did Charles happen to mention, I'm from Briar Falls? - He did. And did he tell you that I inherited the Majestic from my aunt? - Emily was your aunt? - Yeah. - I was very sorry to hear that she passed. She and my parents worked together on the show every year. - I know that Pageant meant a lot to my aunt, but unfortunately community events like that don't bring in much of a profit. - Sorry for the interruption. Then Nell is up to speed on the project, so as soon as she gets up to Briar Falls you two can start working together. Nell will draw up some preliminary sketches. - While you're there maybe you can come see our Twelve Days Of Christmas Festival. - Probably not since I'm not a Christmas person. - Well, you don't have to be. Come, let's get you a proper coffee. - Nell. - Connor. ♪ Christmas is that time of year ♪ ♪ When we gather around to hear ♪ ♪ Words of love and good cheers from all the people ♪ ♪ Let's speak of joy of all mankind ♪ ♪ Let us light our dark nights with illumination ♪ ♪ Let's have a glass of wine ♪ ♪ Let us toast to a beautiful time ♪ ♪ Christmas is that time of year ♪ Mom!

Welcome home, baby! - We weren't expecting you till tomorrow. - I got away early so I could surprise you. - Well it's good to have you home. - It's so good to be home, although I'm not sure how welcome I'm gonna be in the town. - Nobody blames you for that, baby. Everybody knows you're just doing your job. - Yeah, but when my job is the reason why the Christmas show isn't happening, it's kind of hard not to feel bad about it. - How about some cocoa and Christmas cookies in five? - Yes, please! - Go get yourself settle, I got your bags. - Okay! Mom, Dad, the house looks so great this year. - You don't think it's too over the top, do you? - Not by my standards. I take after you on that front. - Ha! Ha! Your mother thinks I went overboard this year. - She always says that. - Only because every year there are more decorations, which he thinks I don't notice. But somehow he makes it all work. - Hey, are these for the pageant? - Uh huh. - They are really beautiful. How's it going? - Well, it's a little bittersweet knowing it's the last one. - And knowing Briar Falls isn't going to have a community playhouse anymore. - Yeah. - Hey, how'd you like to be in the tableaux this year? - Sam, Nell didn't come home to be in it. She's got a job to do. - Hey. Why can't I do both? It's the last one, I should be in it. We have a rehearsal at the Majestic this afternoon. You should come by. - Great. I was gonna go by there anyway. But I thought I'd go see Hannah first. - Did you know she and John are running the Festival? - Yes, she told me. She was very excited. At least the Festival is one tradition that's not going away. Thanks, mom.- Another one. - That's why they are there for. Go ahead. - Oh, hey, Nell. Can you get that weird-sounding phone behind you. I'm a little busy back here. - This phone? Hello? - I heard you were coming home early for Christmas. - Oh, really? Well I heard you and Hannah were running the festival this year. - Hannah's been keeping us both up to date. - She has. Can I... see you in the main office, please? - Oh, absolutely. - I don't know why I'm really hanging it up. - It's not plugged in. So, where's Hannah? - She's on Main Street. She's finishing up the decorations. - Okay, great. I'm gonna go find her. - Wait. Before you go, can I get your advice on a Christmas gift for Hannah?- Absolutely. - Okay, so, it's between an espresso machine or an infinity bracelet. - That's a no-brainer, for Hannah, don't you think? - I guess I sort of hoped you'd say espresso machine. I kind of have my heart set on one of those. - Sorry. Tell you what. If she asks me what to get you, I'll make sure to pass that information on to her. Okay, I'll see you later.- See ya. - That is such a lovely pair of ornaments. - You're here! - Hi! How is it going? - Good. Well the festival is harder than I thought it would be, but it is so much fun. - Let me know if you need any help. - Don't you have your hands pretty full already? - You mean with the Majestic? - Yeah, I mean... You're my best friend, so I would never hold anything against you, but there's a lot of the people in town who aren't so happy with the new owner's plans. - I'm not particularly happy about them either, but it's Connor's theater now. - What's he like? - He seems smart enough, and he is somewhat charming... Although he can jump to the wrong conclusions. - What else? - This is my first job as project manager, you know, and... Have you ever felt like you were a round peg trying to fit into a square hole? - Yeah all through middle school. Remember? - That's what I've felt like ever since I started at my firm. - Right. Listen, if anyone can turn this around, it's you. Coffee later? - Definitely. - Okay. Bye! - Okay. Bye! Hey! - Well, well, Nell Harper.- Barry! - How are ya? - I'm great. - You're... working on the... - Yeah. - Oh yeah, save the Majestic. You know, I just... I felt I had to do something to make my voice heard. But listen, don't worry, I want you to know, we don't hold anything against you. - Wait "we"? Who's "we"? - I'm not the only person in town wearing one of these caps. See ya, Nell. - Oh. See ya, Barry. - Hey. - How long have you been there? - Did you see that guy that just walked out of here? - What guy? - He gave me a hard time about the Majestic, and he practically accused me of ruining the entire town. - Oh, that's Barry. Yeah. He's been in some of the productions here, and he's been in every Christmas Pageant since he was a kid, so he's a little protective of it. The whole town is. - Woh! That would explain all the cold stares. - I'm sorry. Briar Falls is actually a pretty friendly place. They just don't like losing a tradition they've had for over 60 years. - I get that, but my plan for the Majestic will bring in jobs and help commerce on Main Street. - I get that. It's just that the Pageant is the finale to the Twelve Days of Christmas Festival. And that is such a production, the whole town comes together for it. It's a big deal. Your Aunt Emily understood that. - And I guess I don't. Don't tell me you actin some of those productions? - Absolutely. I was in the tableaux every year when I was younger, but really, you know, I'm just an architect who happens to love Christmas. - I sort of picked upon that. Briar Falls really has its effect on people. - Careful, you just might fall under its spell. - That's not likely. - What is it you don't like about Christmas? - I don't have anything against it. - When you said you weren't big... That it meant I didn't like it? - Yes. - Okay. Now who's jumping to conclusions? - Then you do like Christmas? - We traveled around a lot when I was growing up, and Christmas just wasn't a priority for my parents. - So then I've got twelve days to work on you. - Work on me for what? - A crash course in Christmas. - And what do you think that's gonna accomplish? - Possibly changing your mind about the Majestic. - Oh. You do aim high. But I should warn you, I can be pretty stubborn once I've made up my mind. - That doesn't mean I can't try to change it. - So... How was it ladies? - So good. - Delicious. - I'm glad you didn't resist. - Oh I couldn't. - Here you go. I hear you've been working with the enemy. - You mean Connor Martin? - I remember him years ago when he was a kid and came in herewith Emily. He was crazy about my sticky toffee pudding. - Oh. So am I. - Wait. Connor has been to Briar Falls before? - Yeah. I think it was Christmas. He must have been ten or eleven years old. When Emily was working on the show, he was with me all the time. He was like part of the furniture. I think he made one of those decorations on the piano. - Seriously? Those are great. - Emily talked about him a lot. She had such a sweet spot for him. - Sweet. - He's been in here a few times since he came back, and I have to admit I really like him. Although I don't like what he's doing to the Majestic. - That is so funny. Connor has never mentioned coming here for Christmas. But then, why would he if he's not that into it? - I can't believe that he's Emily's nephew and he's not into Christmas. That's insane.- I know! You, too? - No offense, Nell. - Does everyone in town have one of those hats? - You know, it will blow over eventually. - Well in the meantime, I'll just have to mount my own offensive. - I know that look. - Hmm, hmm. - You sure this is gonna help change his mind? - It's worth a try. He said he's going to be busy working while he's here, so if I just can get him to stop and smell the pine needles, you know, maybe it will get him to change his mind and think twice about what he's doing to the Majestic. Besides, who could resist Christmas decorations? - Nobody. - Nobody. Hi Connor. This is my friend Hannah, she's on the decorating committee for the Christmas Festival. She had a few extra decorations lying around and we noticed that your house is the only one that isn't decorated. We'd love to do that for you... What do you say? - It's a generous offer. But I hate to disappoint you, because I'm putting the house up for sale. - So you're not staying in Briar Falls? - Only to seethe project through, and then I'll move onto the next one, which I'm trying to line up right now. - Well, if you change your mind, we're total pros at this kind of thing. - He doesn't change his mind easily. - Sorry if we bothered you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Goodnight. - Maybe Santa Claus wasn't cute enough for him. But Connor sure is cute enough for you. - Don't get any ideas. Connor is a client, and besides, you heard the man... he'll be moving on. But, you're right. He is kind of cute. - Yeah. - Thanks for letting me know, Roy. No, we'll make it work. Okay. Good morning, baby.- Hi sweetie. - Hey, honey. - Good morning. - It's pretty cold out there. - Yes, more than cold. A big freeze last night. I just got a call from Roy... He said because of the cold some of the pipes burst at the Majestic. - What? - He said there might be damage. - How bad is it? - I don't know. I think we should find out. I need to get change. - Okay, I'll warm up the car. Well...? - I'm sorry, Sam, but most of the sets and costumes are ruined, along with a big part of the stage. - We need to get plumbers in here to get those pipes fixed as soon as possible. - Whatever you need to do. - I'm so surprised by the extent of this damage. A pipe bursting did all this? - Yeah, it's karma. - Where did he come from? - Come on Barry, that's a bunch of... - Hooey, oh a bunch of hooey, huh? - Yeah. - Then how come the Majestic is the only building in town that was damaged? - I've been telling Emily for the past five years, that she needed to fix the plumbing before something like this happened. Alright? - Great, well, I still say it's karma. - Is he always like that? - Yeah. You'll get used to him. : So, should I send an official blast that the show is off? - You might have to. - We've been sitting here trying to come up with some options, but with the sets ruined there don't seem to be any. - Well, it was a nice run while it lasted. - Longer than most Christmas Pageants around. - Brought the whole town together. That's for sure. - Here. To the Christmas Pageant... gone before its time. - To the Pageant. - What am I gonna do on Christmas Eve? - The plumbers are coming by today, they'll patch up what they need to for now. - Great. Thanks, Roy. We'll install a whole new plumbing system when we do the new construction. The plumbers are set for this afternoon. - Hey. I didn't hear you come in. - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. - It's truly a jewel box theater. - You know, I was actually thinking this would be a great space for a Virtual Reality Arcade. - Really? You want to put that in a building as old and historic as this? - Isn't the point to modernize, bring this building up to date? A lot of theaters are putting in all sorts of VR experiences, and they're proving to be very successful. - I will get right on that. Why don't we go over the ideas I've been working on? - Okay. - Thank you. In order to break up the Playhouse into the four theaters you want, I was thinking what if we extended through the parking lot into the back, then we could open up the lobby area, and that would allow us to add a cafe, in addition to the concession stand, if that's an idea you like. - I do like that idea. In fact, I like it a lot. - But I'd like to run the numbers and make sure it fits within the budget. - I already did some estimates. I'm almost certain it would work. - Nice. You know, my firm did something similar a few years ago with an old bowling alley. We broke it up into retail shops and added a cafe. It was pretty cool actually. - How did that town feel about it? - I wouldn't exactly call Boston a town. And the bowling alley had been closed for ten years, so the city folk were very happy that we redeveloped it. What, did you think I only went into small towns and tried to change them? - Something like that. - So do you mind if I ask, why you didn't sell the Majestic? I mean, since this isn't exactly in your wheelhouse. - Well, I'd been working for a development firm for several years, and was starting to feel stifled, so when the opportunity for the Majestic presented to me, I figured I take a chance and go out on my own. And after looking around and doing all the research, I saw there wasn't another multiplex within 40 miles, so I figured this would be a good investment for my first project. - Since you are open to taking chances... how would you feel about keeping some of the original design of the Playhouse? You know, like the gilt cornices or maybe some light fixtures. Those could work. - Nell, I don't see that in my vision. - Okay. Can't blame me for trying. - No, you can't. Need help with these? - Yeah. I guess I do. I have more packages than I thought. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Where's your car parked? - I did not bring my car. We're just going right down the road. I hope you don't mind? - No. - Okay. - Is something going on? - It's the opening night of the Christmas Festival. - I suppose I should have seen this coming. - We kick it off every year with a toy drive. That's what the gifts are for. - Oh, here you are! Thank you! Hi Austin.- There you go. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Oh, hey Nell! Connor. Did you see that? - See what? - Forget it. I guess I should go home. - Thanks for your help. - You're welcome. - Connor? - Hi. - What a pleasant surprise. - Hey Mom, Dad. Connor was nice enough to help me bring the gifts over for the toy drive. - Wasn't that nice. Since you're here, why don't you stick around for the lighting? - Hey! - Lighting? What's that? - It's only gonna happen right about now. - Hey everybody! John and I want to thank you all so much for coming tonight to the first night of the Briar Falls Twelve Days Of Christmas Festival! - Thank you for your generous donations to our toy drive. It looks like we really out did ourselves this year! - So, without further ado... Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!- Merry Christmas! - This town really goes all out, doesn't it? - Briar Falls loves its traditions. - I see that. - You know, speaking of traditions, it's the Harper family tradition that on the first night of the Festival, mom makes her famous pot roast, so how would you like to come and join us for dinner? - That's really nice... but I think I should really head home. - 'Cause you got a pot roast waiting there for you? - No. Just a ham sandwich. - Ham sandwich? Come on, we've got homemade biscuits, some mac 'n' cheese, mom's famous peppermint chocolate cheesecake? What do you say? - Cornbread? - Oh yeah! - We got it all. - Yeah! We've got another customer. Come on. - Wasn't this better than a ham sandwich? - Much. Bonnie, it was delicious. Thank you. - You're welcome. Dessert will be in five minutes. - Thank you. - You got it. - Ouf... - I got it. - Oh, I'm stuffed. Thank you for the invite... and for being so insistent. - Don't you mean pushy? - I like to call it being hospitable. That's what small towns do. We try to make everyone welcome. - You sure about that? I've had a lot of people giving me dirty looks and cold stares ever since I came to town. - That's because you came with an agenda people aren't too happy about. - Maybe after they see the new Majestic they won't feel that way. And to tell you the truth, I do feel badly that the Christmas show got canceled. - I know, especially when everyone had already worked so hard on it. - Can't any of it be salvaged? - Pretty much everything had to be dumped. - I don't know if that's exactly the case. I spoke to Roy earlier today and he said that some of the floor damage was repaired quicker than they thought. - Really? What does that mean? - I don't know but it's better than the alternative. - Maybe we could find a way to get the show back on. - Even with the stage fixed, we still only have eleven days to rebuild the sets, and make new costumes... All that took us three months to begin with. - The costumes are a big problem. How are we gonna whip together all new ones for a 19th Century Christmas scene. It's just... That's too elaborate. - Couldn't you make it a more modern scene instead? - That would definitely make it lot easier. - But we've always done an old-fashioned Christmas. - Maybe it's time for a change. Hear me out. We could still do a beautiful scene, but just make it simpler. More Norman Rockwell less Currier & Ives. - The bigger problem is, how are we going to pay for this? There isn't anymore money left in the town's budget. - I could cover the costs. - Why would you do that? This is one thing the town absolutely cannot blame you for. - I know, but it would be my way of honoring Emily's memory, and besides... maybe the cold stares would even stop. - Are you really sure about this? - Yeah. As long as I don't have to be in the show. - That's a deal. We'll make sure that happens. Bonnie? Let's make some phone calls. - Well nice save. - My pleasure. - Sweetie, that looks beautiful. - Hi, Charles. - I was calling to get a status report. Just wanted to see how things were progressing up there. - Things are moving along. I've already had a few meetings with Connor and he seems pretty happy with most of the concepts I've proposed. - Glad to hear that. What's all that noise in the background? - Uh... just some construction work for the Christmas Eve show. They were short handed, so I'm landing a hand. I hope it's not interfering with your work, because I wanted to let you know we'll be closing the office a day early for the holidays, so I'd like you to send me your designs by the 23rd. - I won't let you down. - I'm counting on that. - Goodbye Charles. - It really is a lovely old house. So I guess the next step is drawing up the paper work? - Sounds good. - I should just mention that Christmas is usually a slow time of the year to sell. Are you sure you don't want to wait till after the holidays to put the house on the market? - No. I'd like to roll the cash over from this into another project and if the house sells before the work on the Majestic is completed, I'll just move to the Inn. - Just one more thing... We need to do something about this front yard. - What's wrong with it? - It needs some Christmas. Curb appeal is everything, and we need this house to look as good as every other house on the block. All it would take is a few decorations. It will be subtle and understated. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Okay. - Are you Connor Martin? - Yes. - Well, I just want to thank you so much for saving the Pageant this year. You rock! - Hey. - What did you call me out here for? - This! - Junk? - Not junk, memorabilia. We could use a lot of these items and have an exhibit in the lobby showing the history of the theater. And its productions. There are so many playbills here, we could probably change it out like every couple of months. - I don't see that fitting in with a modern multiplex. - Have you ever been to the modern Strand Theater in the modern East Village? They have a historical exhibition their second floor. - I like the Strand. In fact, I go there quite a bit. - Me, too! - I've never seen their exhibit, and I'm not sold on the idea of having one here. Besides, New York City is the kind of place people go to visit museums now. - People in Briar Falls go to museums, too. - You still haven't sold me on the idea of having an exhibit be part of my multiplex. - My multiplex. It's the town theater. Well, I'm sorry I brought you down here for nothing. - I wouldn't say it was for nothing. - So you'll think about my idea? - No, but like I said, it's always worth putting ideas out there. Where's that coming from? - Sounds like the Christmas carols have started. It's the day two event. - Now I know why you wanted to meet here at six. - I admit it was a set-up, but why not come along? You might like it. - I can't sing, I'm tone deaf. - You can't be worse than me. I was kicked out of the choir in eight grade. - That is sad. - Yeah. But I don't let it stop me. And, if you come, people might look at you differently maybe warm up to you. - It's already happening. I got a hug from a kid today. - Wow. - Yeah. - Maybe some people are coming around, still I'm thinking about the big picture. When the new modern Majestic opens, you don't want people boycotting because you didn't sing Christmas carols and support the town. Do you? - ♪ Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day ♪ ♪ To save us all from Satan's power ♪ ♪ When we were gone astray ♪ ♪ Oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ Comfort and joy oh tidings of comfort and joy ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring to you and your kin ♪ ♪ Good tidings for Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ - Before tonight I'd never been caroling. It was fun. - You were great. - Thank you. - So if this is day two, what does the town do for the rest of the Festival? With the exclusion of day twelve... I already know enough about that one. - We have a best decorated house competition, we have an outdoor Christmas movie, gingerbread house bake-off, sleigh rides... - I'll bet you even have real reindeer for that one. - Horses. But despite the lack of reindeer, we still have one of the best Christmas Festivals around. - I have no problem believing that one. - And it's not just Christmas either. Briar Falls is a great place to live all year round. - Then why did you leave and move to New York? - Because there aren't many opportunities for an architect. And that's what I wanted to be ever since I was 12, and saw the Empire State Building for the first time. - Makes sense. It's old and historic. - Oh yeah. Not sleek modern like the Guggenheim. - I like the Empire State building. I mean, King Kong climbed it, and that's my favorite movies. - But it's an old movie. Not the kind shown in a modern multiplex. - Maybe you're onto something. We could showcase classic movies once a month or so. - Yeah! - I lived in nine different cities before I went to college. My dad is in the Diplomatic Corps, so we lived all over the world. - That must have been exciting. - It was. And my parents haven't stopped. Dad's latest post is Scotland. - Are you going to spend Christmas with them? - We hadn't really discussed it. I figured I'd just work through the holiday. - Really? - Yeah. You got to learn how to stop and smell the pine needles. - What? I've never heard it put like that before. - I just feel like Christmas is really a time for families to be together... even if you don't celebrate it. - Anyway, thanks for walking me home. - No worries. Oh my! - Is this... This is my house! - Nice job! Way better than what Hannah and I would have done. - I told that real estate agent she could put a few decorations up for curb appeal, not turn it into a Christmas float. - You know, all you need is a little top hat and you'd fit right in. This is great! - What? - Are those your plans for the Majestic? - Let's just say it's an attempt. - You know, I've been thinking about doing some restoration myself. Not on me! I meant the Cafe. - If you took out the drop ceilings, I'll bet the original beams are still up there, that would really open up the space up. And I bet the brick behind these walls is in good shape, and probably gorgeous. There's a lot you could do. - Let me think about that. In the meantime, I don't want to take up anymore of your time. I know you're really busy. - Well, I should be, it's just this is... proving to be more of a challenge than I thought. - Maybe another cup of my coffee will help. - Thank you, no. Maybe some fresh air would help. - It's pretty cold out there. - Yeah. If I'm lucky maybe my tablet will freeze. - I hope you're not waiting for Santa. - I'm waiting for inspiration. - How'd you end up out here exactly? - Well I was at Ella's cafe, then I felt like I needed a walk to clear my head. So I went over to the Majestic, but the rehearsals were too distracting, and now I'm here. - And how's the sleigh working out for you? - It's not. - Okay, see you later then. - Wait, where are you going? - To the Snowman building competition. It starts later today. - Is there still time to sign up? - Yes. Of course! Popcorn? - Yes please! - Okay. We'll buy you one. This is mine. - So what was this about me signing off on a snowman? - It's a Snowman building contest. And the Majestic has never not entered. And since you're the new owner, you have to be the one to sign the entry form. - Why do I get the feeling that if I sign it, I'm going to have to build it? - I wouldn't make you do it alone. I am an architect, after all, so it's right up my alley. - I was supposed to work this afternoon. But who cares? I'll sign in. - Okay! - Wow. - Right there. - Clipboard. - Hang on, I got a pen. - Pen. So efficient. - Don't you know me by now? Let's go! ♪ Ah, ah, ah, I'm hoping for snow ♪ ♪ I wanna get dressed up, head out in the cold ♪ ♪ I built myself a special guy ♪ - Here we go. ♪ He'll be cool, all in style ♪ ♪ Got everything I need ♪ ♪ Ready to go ♪ ♪ Oh, look, here it comes ♪ - Love it! ♪ Snow, snow, snow ♪ - Hey! Why don't you wave back? - It's that real estate agent that turned my front yard into Santa's village. - There's more where that came from. - You wouldn't dare. - The reindeer, he looks lonely. - Nell one is enough. You better promise me that you're not gonna do anything or else there's going to be snow on someone else besides him. - You wouldn't dare. I'm too much of a gentleman. - Well I'm no gentleman. I'm sorry dad. - I see you still got that great aim. - I'm so sorry. - Listen. Nell, we got rehearsal later on okay? - Okay. - Wait. You're in the Pageant? - Yeah! - Not singing, I hope. - No, I'm in the tableaux. My talent is standing still. - Wait. That's a talent? Even he can do that. He should be in the show. - You're so clever Connor. - I know. See? No I said I was going to be a gentleman. - Be a gentleman Connor. ♪ Oh, here it comes ♪ ♪ Snow, snow, snow ♪ - We did a good job. He kind of reminds me of my ex-boyfriend. - Was he short and chubby? - No, and he wasn't an usher either, but he did have questionable facial hair. It's true. - So why is he your ex? - Because he moved away and broke my heart. - Why didn't you go with him? - He didn't ask. - He surely was a fool. - Okay if I could have everyone's attention please. Come on gather around. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to announce the winner of this year's Snowman contest. Alright so without further ado... The winner is... Really? Okay. Despite my own personal feelings... the winner is The Majestic Playhouse! Congratulations to you, and to all of our contestants. - Woo! Way to go! - Thank you. Thank you. - Looks great. - Good job. - It looks about right. - That's it. I'm officially done with my Christmas shopping. - What'd you get John? - Don't tell me he recruited you for his espresso machine too! - Kind of... but I guess I'm too late. - No, I got him one. Just don't tell him. And, I know I'm getting the infinity bracelet. - How do you know that? - He his my husband. I know everything he does. What about you? Are you gonna get something for Connor for Christmas? - What? Why? Who's Connor? - Oh, come on. I've known you your entire life. I know when you like someone. - Fine. But I don't like him in the way you mean. - Okay. - Yes there's some flirting, but it's nothing serious. - Okay. - What is this? - That is an old diorama of a Majestic tableau. - Oh. - Connor gave it to me. It was Emily's. - I wish I could have been the original architect on a project like the Majestic. - Honey, you will someday. - You know what? I wish I could pick and choose my own projects. - That would be fun. I bet you'll be all old historical buildings. You know what they always say? Everything old is new again. - Hey. You guys are still up? - Yeah. We were working all night on stuff for the Pageant. - We're about to go to bed. So... - Okay. I'm gonna stay up and get some work done. - At this hour? Good morning. You know you do have a bed upstairs that you can go to. Right? - I intended to, I was just... I had so many ideas last night I didn't want to stop. - So you found your inspiration? - Yeah. I think maybe I did. - Baby, this is beautiful. So you kept the main stage intact, and only added two small theaters? Wait. What's this? What's in the lobby? - That's an exhibit space to show the history of the Playhouse. - I think that's a great idea. - Thanks. Except I'm not turning this version in. It's my fantasy. But I did manage to do Connor's version. - Oh. Okay. I mean this is... It's nice. It's very... - That's okay. It's okay. It's just not the Playhouse. Oh gosh I have to get going. I'm suppose to meet Connor in an hour. I need to... - Nell look. I'll put your stuff away. Go ahead. Thank you. - Get ready. - Hi. Good morning, Connor. - Morning, Roy. Hey have you seen Nell? I'm suppose to meet her. - I haven't seen her yet. - Okay. - By the way, when I was pulling stuff from upstairs, I noticed a couple of Emily's trunks are still up there. Looks like some of her personal things, you might want to go through them since you're family. - Yeah. I'll check it out. Thanks, Roy. - Roy said I'd find you over here. Hey. Does this mean you're reconsidering my exhibit idea? - No. I was just looking through some of Emily's old stuff. - You find anything interesting? - You'll probably think so. - Oh! Did you know this was here? - No, but what is it? - The technical term is a keystone, it's a marker for the building. This is the year the Playhouse was built, and those must be your grandparents initials. Originally it was a part of the main entrance, which was rebuilt, that's probably why it's detached, which is a shame really. Maybe I could incorporate it into the design, if you're not opposed to that idea? - No, I think that's pretty cool. Let's see what it looks like.- Thank you. What did you find? - Hmm... Yeah. That's me in front of the Majestic when I was ten. - How sweet. And you looked so happy. - I was. In fact, I think this was one of the only Christmases I celebrated. That year my parents traveled somewhere where they couldn't take me, so they sent me here to be with Aunt Emily and Uncle Bill. - I knew deep down you really weren't a Scrooge! - Is that what people have been saying? - Oh yeah. Some. But you know, I've been defending your honor. - You have? - Yes. - Isn't that a little risky for your reputation? - Maybe. - So I'm not the enemy anymore? - Oh, you heard that one, too. - It's a small town. - I hope you don't hold that against us. - Actually, Briar Falls is beginning to grow on me. - Is everyone okay? : What happened? - The ladder fell and everything collapsed. - This isn't good. - Let's just try to stay positive. - Positive about what? First the pipes burst, then the set gets ruined by a freak accident. - I know. The odds do seem kind of stacked against us, don't they? - Yeah, this entire set has to be rebuilt and repainted. I don't think we have enough time. - You have to work around the clock. It's not gonna happen. - That's a good idea. Around the clock! If we work around the clock, I bet we can get this right back on schedule. - I can pitch in. - Yeah. So can I. You can't exactly afford to be too picky right now. - We would love to have your help, Connor. - Okay. - Connor is on board. What do you say, Roy? - Alright let's do it. - Okay. Let's get to it. - Have you ever built a set before? - No, but then I had never built a snowman before, and we won first place at that, didn't we? ♪ We've hung the ornaments with care ♪ ♪ It's Christmas time, my dear ♪ ♪ You can feel it in the air ♪ ♪ We've put out cookies for Saint Nick ♪ ♪ The snow is falling now ♪ - Doing a good job. ♪ Sitting around the Christmas tree ♪ ♪ I hear those sleigh bells rings ♪ I'm certain he would tip his hat to you. - I don't care what Barry... Actually, I do. - You do? - He caused a lot of problems. - Hey dad! - Hey! Listen, good work both of you. - Thank you. We're thinking of knocking off for the day. - Okay. Alright, well your Mom and I want to get out of here shortly ourselves so... - Alright, see you at home. - Okay, baby. Listen Connor. Thank you. - You're welcome Sam. - Okay. Good night. - Yeah. - What are you doing here? - Same thing you're doing here. - Barry, Connor was working with us all day. - Wow. I take back most of what I thought about you. - So you'll stop the protesting? - Oh no. - No? - I plan on resuming that right after the Christmas Pageant. - Merry Christmas Barry. - You too. - You know, we have been so busy all day we didn't get a chance to go over those plans I wanted to show you. - Well, let's go to Ella's and do it there. - Sounds good. I'm starving. And on the schematic you'll see, I moved the concession stand to the south wall so the cafe could have more seating. - Nice. I like it. - Great. Okay, so we have gone over the lighting, finishes, materials, the VR Arcade of course. I can get started on the next drawings, and over everything with Charles. - Great. I'm excited to see the final designs. What are these? The Majestic Playhouse & Entertainment Complex? - It's just a part of my creative process. It's nothing. - It's very clever. You kept some of those old flourishes and mashed them with the new look. - So you like it? - I like the name. I was thinking we just go right to dessert. Ella has her famous once-a-year Christmas special on the menu. - What is it? - Christmas Decadence for Two. It's mint chip ice cream with a whole mountain of goodies and some frozen raspberries. - Mint chip is my favorite... - It's mine too. - Let's do it. I want to see this thing. Here it comes... - Drum roll please. - Oh! - If you can finish this, it's on the house. - I'm always up for a challenge. - Only one other team has been able to finished it so far this season. - Well you know we are on a winning streak, so let the games begin. - Here here! - Good luck. - What's wrong? - I'm just trying to figure out the best and easiest way to tackle this thing. - There is no best and easiest way. You just have to dive right in. - Good to know. - Ouf, we survived. - We survived. - Where's that music coming from? - Oh. It's the Christmas dance. We missed it. - Maybe we don't have to. - Oh my gosh! - My lady. - Wait! In the street Connor? We can't dance in the street. - You can with me. - Oh my God. ♪ This Christmas, I'm hoping ♪ - Oh, sorry! - You're not bad. ♪ For me ♪ ♪ Santa gave me a card with his number ♪ - Come here. - Nice moves. - We did live in Buenos Aires for a couple of years, and my mother made me take dance lessons. You should see my tango. ♪ If you give me a kiss ♪ ♪ And I say that this is ♪ ♪ Exactly how I know ♪ ♪ And this is the year I have someone near ♪ ♪ It can't be very far ♪ - So wait a second. Let me get this straight. You spent the entire day together, danced under the moonlight, and then he kissed you! - Yeah. That's amazing. - I know. I really like him. - Well it sounds to me like it's mutual. - Except that I can't ignore the fact that he'll be moving on after we finish the Majestic. - Right well you could always just see how things go and then start to overthink it later. I'm just saying! - I think I'm gonna take a break. Maybe run over to Ella's an get an espresso. Can I get a delicious espresso for either one of you? - No thanks. - You sure? Okay. See you in a bit. - Thank you. So subtle. Hey, how did Connor like the plans that you brought over for him? - He liked them. I just wish I did, too. - Right. - You know. Hello? - Hey, I hope I didn't call at a bad time. - No. Not at all. What's up? - Vera wants me to bring in come Christmas and she's insisting that I get a Christmas tree. She even offered to bring one over and decorate it. But I told her that I'd take of it myself. - Oh. Only you don't have the slightest idea where to begin? - Well, I know I have to get a tree. - There's a Christmas tree lot on the corner of Main and 5th. I'll meet you therein ten minutes. - Thank you. - Go, it's all good. - Are you sure? I'm gonna go! - I'll be fine. Thank you! Call me later! - Okay. - Are you okay? - Yeah. ♪ Oh, Christmas tree ♪ - Hey. - Thank you. ♪ O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree ♪ - You look like you've done this before. - I have! I'm very good at it. - Good job! ♪ When Summer's here ♪ ♪ But also when ♪ - You like the reindeer? - Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta! - Cheers! I think Vera will be happy with this. - Hey. Thank you for doing all this. - Oh. Are you kidding? Don't you know by now how much I love to decorate for Christmas? - Oh that's obvious. How about I take you out for dinner? To thank you. - Sure! Okay. I'm gonna put this away before we go. Hey what are these? I'm thinking about that for my next project. - And what will you be turning this into? - Some investors I knowin California approached me about redeveloping it into loft spaces. - California is nice. - It is. But I haven't made up my mind yet. - Oh... I might have to postpone that dinner. I forgot I'm supposed to meet Hannah and John to go ice skating. - Another Festival event? - Yeah. Day eight. You interested? - Yes! - This isn't what I had in mind when I invited you to dinner, but these are good. - I know, right? You can get chestnuts on every corner in New York, and somehow they're just not as good as the ones in Briar Falls. - So you really are a small-town girl at heart. - Probably. I mean as much as I love my life in New York, I do miss Briar Falls... especially at Christmas. - You don't go home at Christmas? - No, I go home, it's just... only for a few days. I can't remember the last time I was here for the entire festival. - Charles works you that hard? - It's not Charles, it's me. I'm always trying to insert my vision on the firm's vision, and they're not exactly compatible, so I make things harder on myself. - Maybe that's because you're not where you should be. - I guess I could leave the firm. Go out on my own. - But you don't think you're ready for that. - Sometimes I do, but then I remember I have rent. So I convince myself I'm not ready. - Well for what it's worth, I've worked with a number of different architects, and I think you have a lot of talent, and obviously a lot of passion for your work. I admire that. Okay. How about we see how talented you are on this ice? - You ready to give it a try? - As ready as I'll ever be. - Take my hands. Good job. Great. So the key is to relax. Oh my gosh! - I'm trying. - You're terrible at this. - I appreciate it. Thank you. - Look at me, Connor. Don't look at your skates. There you go. Okay one hand. - Find you rhythm. Right, left. Right. You're doing a good job. Hello Charles... I finished the design studies, and will be giving them to Connor this afternoon and I thought it would be nice to come down to the office and give you a look in person. Also, there's something else that I would just like to speak with you about face to face... - Nell, if you plan to get to the dress rehearsal on time, you'd better get going. - Okay. Just finishing up here. - Alright. Can you take this rope with you? : Fantastic! Lucy that's wonderful work. I love that! That's great. Right now, we've got to do the tableaux. Barry, Nell, you guys back there? You guys come out please? - Yes. - Okay. Let's just try it center stage. As soon as the musicians clear. And go ahead. That's good. Show me what you're really gonna do. That's the spirit. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you! I brought chestnuts... - That's sweet but I'm about to catch the 1:00 back to the city. I'll be back tonight. - Does that mean you finished the plans? - It does. I emailed them to you a little while ago. - Hard copies. - Hard copies that I'm taking to the office. I do have another one back at the house if you don't kind going. Mom should be home. - Got it. - Yeah? - Hey! If you're free, could we finally go to dinner? No chestnuts or ice cream involved. - I would love that. Thanks. - Be safe. - I'll see you later. - This is really great work, Nell. - Thank you. But I have to be honest with you... this was a very difficult project for me to design. It felt way too much like losing an old friend. - But you rose to the occasion and delivered. - I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to believe in the things I design. I think you'll agree I was never really the right fit here, and the last couple of weeks back in Briar Falls help me realize that. - I saw great potential in you... And I never should have tried to change your vision. - So you understand where I'm going with this? - I do... - Okay. - And I'm sorry to lose you. - Well hang on! You won't get rid of me that easily. If it's okay I would like to stay until the Majestic project is completed. - I hoped you'd say that, because I still think you'll do a great job on the project. But what about after that? - Well I've already been asked to redesign a cafe back in Briar Falls. And since the town is filled with lots of historic buildings, it seems like the perfect place to go out on my own. - They'll be lucky to have you. - It's very kind. Well I guess I'll see you after the New Year. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Nell. - Thank you. And a happy New Year. - Thank you. - One second. Come in! - Hello, hello. - Yeah. It'll be fine. Could you hold on? - Bonnie, sorry to bother you. Nell said she left me some plans. - Yeah, they should be on the table next to the door. - Thanks. - You know what? I've gotta go. Yeah. We'll talk later. Connor? - Yeah? - You're coming to the Pageant tomorrow night aren't you? - I thought I might chance it. - Good! And don't worry. Everybody's being in good spirits for Christmas Eve. - Except this year is gonna be a little different. - True, but we still got to go with a bang. - Alright then. I'll see you tomorrow night. - Alright. - Thanks. See you later! - What's going on? - Well it's my duty to present the award for the Best Christmas House Display. - My house won! - In my opinion, it's fine. But the committee overruled me. - Thanks Barry. - Can we get the shoot? Let's go. - Goodnight. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks! I won! Watch yourself! - Connor! Let me guess. You're here for last minute Christmas shopping? - Sort of. I'm looking for something for Nell. - Well, you've come to the right place. Did you have something special in mind? - I know nothing about antiques, so I need your help. - John! Nell just called, she's leaving the firm. Oh! Hey Connor. - Hey. - Connor, you were looking for a gift for Nell? - You know, I'll just come back later. - See ya. Did I... say something wrong? - Hi! - Hey. - Hi! I came straight from the train station to tell you my news. - I already heard... you quit your job. - Wow, news travels fast. - It's a small town. What did you expect? I don't know... congratulations maybe. You don't seem very happy for me. - You know how much the Majestic project means to me. How much I put into it. I can't believe you just walk away from it. - Why would you think I would just walk out? - Because you never liked it to begin with. - Okay hang on. I didn't agree with the direction you were taking. I never let that interfere with me doing my job. - Then why did you quit? - My job or the Majestic? - The Majestic! I left my job because I did not want to feel stifled anymore. You said yourself maybe I didn't belong there, and then I realized you were right. I left the firm, but then I told Charles that I would stay on the Majestic until it was completed. Because that's the kind of person that I am. - I heard Hannah say you were leaving the firm, so I thought... - You thought the worst. I don't understand how you could do that after we work so closely on this together. - I jumped to a conclusion again, I'm sorry. - Like you always do. I can't. I think we see things too differently. I don't see how this could work. - Hey baby. Aren't you coming down for dinner? - I'm not hungry. - You know, something tells me that there's a lot more to this story. - He was the one who convince me to go after something I believe in. And then I did that. And then he turns around and think I let him down. - Alright then maybe you two just need to give it some time. - No he's just infuriating. He could have at least apologized. - Nell Harper, did you give him a chance? - Yes! - Yeah, I didn't think so. You know, you can be just as infuriating in your own way. And I say that with love. - I guess I did do most of the talking. - Listen, in spite of everything, you can be proud that the town is still gonna have its last Pageant, and that's all because of you and Connor. - Yeah. We were a good team. For a while, at least. - Take some time. Alright? When you're ready, come down. - Okay. - Something wrong with the food? - No, I'm just not very hungry. - About 20 some years ago a little boy came in here and his face was about as long as yours is right now. He was sad because his parents sent him here for Christmas, and he didn't have any friends in town. But then some of the local kids came into the cafe. And they invited the little boy to make Christmas ornaments with them, and suddenly he was so happy because he got to experience first hand what the spirit of Christmas was all about. - Those are the ornaments we made that day. I haven't forgotten. The pine cone Santa is mine. - Oh! Oh! Oh! I missed you Connor. - You're crazy. - You see, you are part of this place. I guess what I'm trying to say is that despite some of our differences, it is really great to have you back here. - And I like the fact that coming to your cafe feels a bit like coming back to that great Christmas all those years ago. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm glad some things stay the same. - So why not stick around permanently? I'm sure Nell would like that. - It may have been true yesterday, but I'm not so sure about today. I really messed things up between the two of us. - Plenty of people in town have gotten over their feelings about you and losing the Majestic. I'm sure Nell will too. - Yeah, I see you've stopped wearing your cap. - You see? Sooner or later, we all come around. - Even me. I have to admit, I've grown pretty fond of this town. - Can I get you anything else? - I used to really like your sticky toffee pudding. You still have it? - No. Of course, I do. It's tradition. - Tradition! - Coming right up. - Thank you. - Here we go. - Are you okay? - No. We're running behind. I don't think we have enough hands. - Hannah offered to help if we need it and it sounds like we definitely do. So I'll go find her. - Yes, thanks, please! - ...super stressed out so if you can get back there and help her with... I mean, there's still a lot of costumes that need to be pull together last minute. And... - I'll see you backstage. - I didn't expect to see you here tonight. - I had a Christmas present to deliver. - I don't understand. - Open it. - These are my fantasy plans for the Majestic. - They are not just a fantasy anymore. Those are the plans I want to go with. - You changed your mind? Why? - After two weeks being in Briar Falls, one long Christmas Festival, being around so many great people and... meeting you, Nell Harper. I realized that this town doesn't need a multiplex. It needs The Majestic. - Really? - I know I jump to conclusions. I messed up. - We both did. - But I have to thank you because you made me realise that some things in Briar Falls just need to stay the same. - Thank you. Let's go tell everybody! - Hey! Wait up! - When everybody comes into the front, that's what they gonna see. - It's incredible. Look at the space you have over here. - I was thinking that we could program plays, concerts, lectures on the main stage. - That's what I told you. - I know, along with the movies and the VR Arcade, I was thinking it could be a winner. - So it sounds like you'll be sticking around for a while. - I decided to pass on the California project. - Oh. Well... I will be sticking around too. Since I'm going out on my own, Ella's Café will be my first job. - Then I'll be your second. - Another theater? - No, Emily's house. I want to preserve the historical aspects of the house, and then add some... - Some modern amenities? - Yeah. Exactly. - How would you feel about coming to my parent's house for Christmas dinner tomorrow? - Is there room for two more? - Always. - Great. Because I invited my parents a few days ago and they're flying out here for Christmas. If that's okay with you? - Absolutely. - Alright. - Somebody grab some ice, I think Barry sprained his ankle. - Have a seat, have a seat. - Is it okay? Let me take a look. There's no way he's gonna be able to stand for the tableaux. - Maybe there's something to this Karma's stuff after all. - Whatever it is, we have to find somebody to take his place. - Hey! I can do it. - Really? - How hard can it be to stand still for a few seconds? I'll do it. - Okay! Barry, I need you out of that costume. Connor, meet me in the dressing room, I'll get my needle and thread. - Connor! I take back everything I thought about you. - Thanks, Barry. - Okay come on. Let's get you up. ♪ Fall on ♪ ♪ Your knees ♪ ♪ O hear ♪ ♪ The angels' voices ♪ ♪ O night ♪ ♪ Divine ♪ ♪ O night ♪ ♪ When Christ was born ♪ ♪ O night ♪ ♪ Divine ♪ ♪ O night ♪ ♪ O night divine ♪ - Oh wow! - They're under the mistletoe! - Bravo! - Good job, buddy!
