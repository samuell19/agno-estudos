SHAVED Get off. Give me your wallet. Empty your pockets. Give me your watch. You don't have a watch? Give me your sneakers. Do you know what time it is? - Three twenty. - Thank you. Can you call Damian, please? It's Lucio. - Lucio, you know what time it is? - Three twenty. What else did he take, besides your sneakers? My bike, money... He gave me back my wallet with my IDs. They stole your bike... He also wanted my watch. When he asked for it I remembered where I've left it. We must to report it. You used your bike to go everywhere. This is going to change your life. Life... What's your shoe size, Damian? I'II get dressed and we'll go to the police. Don't you have a bigger size? The 18th is the closest Police Station. Shall I get you the shoehorn? Hey, that money... Can I have it back tomorrow? Lucio! Come for one or two games. I'm going to take the bus. How much are they today, Fredy? One for five, ten for forty five, a hundred for 420. Give me one. - What? - One more. - Do you know if the 106 is still running? - I don't know. - Would you like one? - O.K. Light? Can you break me a 100 note? I don't think the bus driver Will change it. What's your name? - Lucio. Yours? - Gustavo. Here's my bus. - Don't you have anything smaller? - It's all I've got. This is a fake bill. Pablo! - Don't you know what time it is? - Around four fifteen. - Does mum know you're out here? - I don't know. She was sleeping when I came out and I forgot to take the keys. I couldn't sleep. Will you come to my room and count up to 100? 1, 2, 3... ...4, 5, 6... ...7, 8, 9, 10... ...11, 12, 13, 14... ...15, 16, 17, 18... ...19, 20... How could I know about it? Don't say that. The bus driver saw it right away. It's easy to see it's fake. Look at his eyes. - Which eyes? - Uriburu's. He's cross-eyed. Do you mean that I knew about it and I gave it to you on purpose? I had to walk home. Come on, say it! Say I gave you a fake note on purpose, to make you walk... ...40 blocks barefooted at three in the morning. It was 4 o'clock. My feet hurt. - That guy, where did he stick the knife? - Here And you're not going to report it to the Police? Cut it out with the police! I have to go. Me too. Bye. - Who is it? - It's me, Lucio. Remember me? - Here it is. It's still clocking. - How strange. - How long has it been here? - Four or five days. - Thursday. - Yes, Thursday. I never liked digital watches. On those with needles it's easier to read the time. I know someone who's got a digital one with radio and phonebook. Until yesterday I thought it was stolen. Bye, thanks. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Come in. I think I'm losing my hair too. Hello. Yes, operator. Carlos, yes. Yeah... Yes... How? No, no. When did it happen? No, nothing. I'm astonished. Lucio... Uncle Carlos called this morning. It seems Granny started to feel bad at night... went outside to take some air, she took a magazine with her. After a little while she died. It was before dawn... Over there, of course. Was she bad already? Will we have time for a coffee? - What are they? - Some records. Let's meet in 45 minutes at the takeaway. Wait, I'II come with you. Don't you think 45 minutes is too much? Have you had a haircut? I run into your father. He says he'll meet you in 25 minutes at the take- away. Do you have another 100 note? I want to check something. Listen to this. Do you remember my cousin Sergio? - No. - You met him last year. He worked in an investment group, he used to change dollars for me. Oh, yes. The other day I saw him again at a family party... ...and he told me he bought a Kawasaki 400. Some time ago he parked it outside a movie theatre and it was stolen. A few days later he goes to a disco with some friends... ...and at around 4:30 they go out... and see two guys on a bike. His bike. My cousin's friends told him: "You're kidding, That can't be your bike". But my cousin was sure and went to the policeman next block. Apparently, the papers were in order... ...but all the same he said; "We all go to the police station". He phoned his father who took the original papers... ...and it was found out... that the guy's were fake. He'II get it back next week. Won't you say something? Isn't it too early to go to a disco? I'm wasted. I'm not used to this, I've got to recover. You should quit smoking. I don't smoke... What about your wife and son? You inhale the smoke anyway. - Then I should give my family up. - I didn't mean that. Something like that. - Have you got a 100 note? - Let's go. Let me see. - Two 50 notes would be the same? - Forget it. - Are you having dinner with us? - They are waiting for me at home. Damian! Hello? Ah, hello... Did you arrive OK? He's gone out to work... Here it's ten thirty in the morning, mom. It's alright. I'II tell him you called. No, it's not cold. Here it's not cold. Bye, When are you coming back? Your hair has grown a lot! Do you know that in the Northern Hemisphere... ...the water goes down the drain in the opposite direction? It's the change of weather. Winters in Canada are terrible. - What's that? - The saw. Lucio had it under his bed. Lucio! - Are you going out? - I'll go buy some cigarettes. What happened to my cigarettes? I left a box on my night table and another by the telephone. You know I smoke lights, mum. Bring me Parisiennes. And also the change. Good evening. One Parisiennes and one Marlboro. Take a look at the eyes. Sorry to bother you, I know you won't believe me. They gave me fake money and I'm broke. I live far away. When I got on the bus the driver told me it was fake. I knew it. Have a look. His eyes. - Yeah, I heard about these. - Can you give me a lift? Here. For the bus fare. - What, you wanna shave me? - Stop and get off. And now what? The money? - Not that, give me your sneakers. - My sneakers? What for? Don't think so much and do as I say. - Shall I hand them to you? - In my hands, you think I'm stupid? Do you want me to go on and break your arm? No. - What are you doing here? I went out and I only had this note. The one you gave me. - Cross-eyed? Cross-eyed. I'm going to the bathroom. Don't flush, it could wake them. DAMIAN CALLED WHEN YOU WENT OUT IT WAS FAKE It's around 6 p.m., weekday. You walk on the streets. You're not in a hurry, you have an appointment with the doctor... ...or a movie, but you're early. You stop by a record shop... ...Iook through the window. There's a lot of people, everybody is rushing home. There are kids coming out from English or computer lessons... ...because everybody now takes computer lessons... ...particularly in Belgrano and you're in that area. Cabildo and Juramento. Then you stop by a clothes shop you look at the prize tags. You don't think of buying anything. You don't even see what you look at. You think of something else... ...even if you don't have anything to think about. And when you're about to leave... ...you see him coming out of the shop. What would you do? What? - You see him coming out of the shop. - Which shop? - The guy with the knife, what would you do? - What would I do with what? You run into the guy who stole your bike, what do you do? I don't know. I'd look at him. Probably nothing. Did you find your watch? Yes. Fredy, I've been told you could do something about this. How many do you want? How much are they today? One for ten, ten for ninety, 100 for 880. Give me five. - I can give you five. - Done. I have a headache. Aspirins and chocolate peanuts. - Eighteen. - I'll pay you with videogame tokens. I'II give you candies because I haven't got any change. Did you swallow it? May be... I don't want to say anything because then you'd say... Better then. I don't like messing with other people's lives. You don't get a headache out of nowhere. The worries, the cigarettes... ...all that stuff. Staring so long at the videogame gave me the headache. - How much is one of these? - A new one? - One like this one. - Three or four hundred dollars. And it rides fine, doesn't it? Yes. 'RED STAR' MARCH 15TH 1991 Do you think this place is safe enough to park such a bike? Lucio! - Lucio! - I'm coming! Come on Picasso, the food's getting cold. What is this made with? It's a potage Quebecois. Fine herbs, onions, bacon, potatoes and lentils. Lentil stew. A typical dish from over there. Sorry, there's nothing I can do. I need a spare part from Buenos Aires. If you wait 'til tomorrow, the van is coming and we can go get it. Anyway, this thing is useless. You'd better sell it as junk. Buying a new one would be the cheapest. - I dropped by your place. - I've been calling you. What's in there? Clothes. Are you leaving home? I am back, rather. When I left home it was still dark. I filled the tank, drove a few miles. I'm a bit hungry. Don't you have anything to eat? I'm broke. Have you got an extra token? No, they're very expensive. I've been playing with the same one for about half an hour... ...and I still have chances. I'm beating all records. - What's your score? - 72600 something. I could never beyond 500. You need some practice. I'II get some tokens. I'm the worst. I'm bad at this too. - Lucio. - Gustavo. Would you like a drink? A glass of milk, please. Cold. I haven't eaten anything today. Just an apple, but it was soft... ...so I gave it to a hungry kid. Fredy! - Could you spare any money? - No, I have nothing. Why are you barefoot? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. 'RED STAR' - I'm off. - Finish that first. More coffee? - That's ok mum, he can help himself. - Yeah, I can help myself. Here, take this. Have you ever had a motorcycle? - No. - But we had a Fiat 125. We sold it last year.
