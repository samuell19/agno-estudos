Deirdre! Deirdre! Hello. Oh, Charles. I was hoping she'd pick up the phone but she's probably still doing her homework. Hang on, then. I'll try and get her. Deirdre, telephone! Telephone, Deirdre. You have a phone call. - Who is it? - Charles. I'm busy. This is the 3rd time he's called today. Be a little kind. I didn't ask him to call. You can't keep on living like a crab within a shell. Charles is very nice. I don't see why… That's exactly why, grandma. Don't be so dumb. All right. I'm inviting him anyhow. I won't be here. You're being silly. It's all been planned. Don't do this to me, I mean it. Hello? I'm afraid she can't come to the phone now. She's still studying. But we'll see you on Saturday night for dinner. I can't believe it. She can't just invite him over like that. She knows how I feel. What does she care what I want? Oh, come on over. Wasn't it lovely, Deirdre? Isn't he nice? God! What a life! Grandma! Grandma, are you all right? Where are you? Answer me! Did you feel that lightning? It hit the roof. What is it? Is there someone there? Vern, is that you? - Hold the lamp, will you? - What are you doing? I've lived in this house 46 years and I've never had a stranger in here without an invitation. If I have to use this I'm gonna use it. Don't go down there. Go to your room and lock the door. Don't be crazy. I'm not gonna be intimidated by a bunch of common thieves. There's	nothing common about that, let's call the police. It's not working. Grandma, let's hide. It's a good idea. Which one you think. Give them that bag. We've got plenty. Grace's got nothing to do but clean fish, anyways. - Do you think it is late? - 7:30? The only person to sleep for this hour is your mother. They might be around the back. What the hell are you doing? Damn, Jerry, that girl is only 17. So what? She's old enough. She ain't gonna be interested in a "no can" like you. Grace? - What's the problem, boy? - Something's wrong. Hold on, I'm going with you, son. Grace? Deirdre. Anybody home? What the hell? Who are you? Jerry, look out! Get back! Oh, my god! Jerry! Speak to me, son. We've got to go before he comes back. Grandma, we've got to go. Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! They almost look like angels. I don't think so. She's been shot. GRANDMA, let's get out of here. We must be dreaming. This is no dream. This is incredible. They're really here. I must try to help her. Grandmother, please! Lovely lady, I'm just I've come to help you. Is there anything I can do? She should be at a hospital where she could get better care. Grandma, they can't go to a hospital. Just sit tight. Let's see what we got here. Wait a minute. What about the sheriff? He's gonna be real pissed if we don't wait for him. This is pretty serious. He shouldn't be playing politician at the Rotary Club. He's supposed to be on the way. He ain't here now, Sweeney. You, Robert. You gonna round back. You slip in the kitchen. I'm gonna distract them at the front. What are we supposed to do in the house? You find out what's going on. Now do it. I'll cover you. Go on. Bye. Bye. What the hell was that? I don't know. Just do it. What's wrong? Police! You have 30 seconds to come out with your hands up! It's locked. Kick it in, Sweeney. 15 seconds! Kick it again. Jeez! I'm still over here! Are you trying to kill me? Where's Sweeney? Conney, I'm at the location. You be careful in there. Sheriff. What's the word on Sweeney? He's dead, Hollace. His wife been called? I took care of it. My wife is over there now. We were really careful Sweeney just screwed up. I told him to be really careful but he kicked the door in and that was it. Roberts, you set up by the end of the road. Nobody goes in or out. Sure thing. - I wanna hear "yes, sir". - Yes, sir. I'll talk to you about this later. I've got Vern Burdett in the back seat. You're all right? How do you feel, sheriff? I'm sorry, Mr. Burdett. I'm really sorry about your son. That ain't gonna bring my boy back, is it? I know this is difficult. Did you see what happened? I was standing right behind him. He fell in my arms. Did you get a good look of who it was? It was like nothing I've ever seen before, I know that. Don't worry, Mr. Burdett, We'll take care of everything. If you don't I will. I will blow that thing's head off. He is gonna drive you home now, Mr. Burdett. They have no escape, sheriff. I tried the phone. It's dead. There are 3 exits. There is the front door up the porch you see here, a kitchen door on the west and a service door here on the east. All exits have visual coverage. Where do you need me? I think I will need you on the other side. I'm gonna make contact with the house. The sheriff is gonna attempt to make contact with the house. This is sheriff Hollace McMahon. To whoever is inside the house, please, identify yourself. I repeat, identify yourself. Then come out the house. Let the two woman out first. To the front door. Slowly, with the hands in the air. All is surrounded. Repeat, all is surrounded. Come out the house. Let the two woman out first. And back to the front door slowly. With your hands in the air. Honeycut, leave Jenkins in position. Tell everybody got out to command post, on the double. What were you thinking about going in that house without backup? What the hell do you mean? I feel the right thing to do is going in as soon as possible - and save those women. - You got a man killed. And we still don't know what's going on in here. That's easy for you to say, you weren't here. That's right, You were in charge and you violated department procedure. But you know what? It's gonna be followed from now on. You got that? Yes, sir. - Tha't it? - For now. We've got a hostage situation here, men. Whatever happens, remain calm. - Understood? - Yes, sir. Stay cool and don't fire unless you're fired upon and you're certain of a clear and asserted target. Otherwise, innocent people get killed. Exactly, what are we gonna do, sir? We are gonna do exactly nothing but sit tight and stay alert until I have more information to work with. I don't want anybody else killed and specially the 2 women in that house. Let's do this thing right. This is sheriff Hollace McMahon. This is the last time I'm gonna ask you. Please, let the two women out first then come out the front door slowly with your hands in the air. What the hell was that? Mrs. Clark, are you all right? You've got 3 minutes, then we're coming in. We better answer him. If we don't we might all be killed. He doesn't understand you. You're wasting your time. Mrs. Clark, are you all right? Let me try. I'm all right, sheriff. - Is Deirdre with you? - I'm here. Have you been hurt? Take it easy. We're going in when I say and not before. And that we're doing like police officers and not some trashy gun-waving mob. Now clear it, sergeant. Deirdre, can you hear me? If you're all right give me some kind of sign. I think he wants me to talk to the sheriff. Do you want me to talk outside? We're all right in here, we're safe. How many people are in the house with you? They're not people, sheriff. They ain't human. Can we talk to them? Do they know we want them surrender. We want them let out the house. They can't understand you. They're not like us. They're from somewhere else. Do you think they'll let us go? I don't think so. We are their security. You mean "hostages". I need a drink. - How is it going? - It's gonna be a long night. And buzzy is not going to be happy along he's working for you. But you've got some good men. Yeah, well. It's not get to me, is just, anyone in side other, no me. I think you're just a little bit out of shape because you got the job after sheriff Wallace. But I'm with you. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Those my goldfish. We named them both Bob. It's me and my parents. They were killed in a car accident last year. Who are you? Do you understand anything that I say to you? What are you gonna do with us? Grandma, I have to say something. I know who they are. What do you mean? Show her. What is this? What's going on? We've got business up there. I got orders from the sheriff not to let anybody through. They don't make no sense. These folks are your friends, we just come to help. You let us through or what? I'm sorry about Jerry. But I can't do it. I've got orders from the sheriff and I've got to follow them. Would you follow them if your brother Tim got blown away by god knows what and then some little black boy come up and tell you you've got to go home and stay there while he sits on his ass? We just wanna be there. Think on the best for your boys. - Cream, right? - Thanks. Department of defense has someone on the way. Good, what they send him? Airforce, small unit. No E.T.A. yet. - This is yours - Sorry. - What do you make of this? - I don't know. This is something else. It's definitely not your standard hostage situation. There's nothing standard about it. We've too be in held hostages by something with no demands. At least none we can understand. Sheriff. Yes, Ma'am. - Where are you? - I'm here. Are you all right, Mrs. Clark. They want to talk to you. Tell them to come to the front door unarmed. I don't think they'll do that. You better come inside. Have either you or your granddaughter been harmed, Mrs. Clark? No, we're both fine. Please, come inside without a gun. I'll answer the door. All right. If you haven't heard from me in 10 minutes do try and make contact and if you can't you come on in. Sir, good luck in there. I'll show you Real slow now. I'm unarmed. There's nobody with me. Get back to your positions, we're covering the sheriff. Everybody just take it nice and easy. You okay, Ma'am? Don't worry. They won't hurt you. What on earth is that? I don't know but it's got tits and __ Please, take your policemen and leave. We're going to be fine. Leave? There's no way I can do that. I don't think there'd be a problem if you and your men were gone. Two people—one of them a police officer—are dead. Due to these creatures. We do have a problem here, a serious one. They don't mean to hurt any of us. They just want to leave. I don't understand. Are you able to communicate with them? Yeah, sort of. Can you tell them that you're all in danger here as long as they hold you by force. But they're not holding us by force. Sheriff, they're already in great danger. Something you don't know anything about. What are you talking about? There's an assassin that is trying to kill all of them. That's why they're here. To get away. Sheriff, are you there? It's the radio! Let him go! Sheriff, are you there? If I don't answer they're going to come in here. Sheriff, do you copy? McMahon here. You'd better get out. We've got a problem. What's the problem. Burdett is back and this time he's brought friends. For god's sake don't let anyone out of this house. I'm gonna try and protect all of you. Hold on! I want you all to know I understand why you all came here. We don't think you understand at all. I understand all right. I understand you want your revenge. I also understand that if you do that maybe those two ladies inside will get killed. Maybe those creatures or maybe some of you. Maybe you'd better stop sticking up for them. Cause we don't want any more people getting hurt. That's why we're here, Mr. Burdett. What about Sweeney? And what about my boy? God Damnit they gonna steak us. I say, we're go in there and dry your asses out. The best thing for you all to do is get back in your vehicles and go home with your families. You better get on the right side, boy 'cause we are the humans in case you didn't notice. Then act like it. Think before something terrible happens. Leave peaceably. or I'll be forced to disarm all of you and place you under protective custody. That's gonna be very hard to do 'cause if you look around you'll see that your men ain't either with you. What are they gonna do? Shoot us? I say we go in there and do what we came for. What have you come to do? get your friends killed? Mr. Burdett is grieving. You all can do yourselves a big favor Just go on home. Come on. Let's get going. Get your hands off me. What are you gonna do, let a nigger run you off? Goddamn it! You're all traitors, all of you! You ain't no better than that things in there. Goddamned fools! You ain't heard the last to this, boy. You can bet on that. Good job with the road block, Roberts. two hostages, a young girl and an old lady. Sheriff McMahon, I'm Helen Anderson, Department of Defense. Sergeant Hawk's been briefing me. It was nice to meet you. Don't tell me you're the only thing the Air Force has sent. No need to worry. We're bringing in a containment extraction team from Roy Patterson arrival at 8 a.m. Good. It's been quite a night. From what I've heard so far it sounds like you've been handling this like an ordinary hostage situation. You have a better idea? What we have here is an encounter with alien lifeforms of unknown origin and capabilities. Ordinary rules and procedures don't apply. There are still 2 women being held in that house. They're not the most important thing at stake here. Maybe not to you but they certainly are to me. You simply must understand. The creatures have to be contained. If the situation becomes unstable before my team arrives they must be destroyed regardless of the consequences. Let me tell you something, lady. When your people arrive I'll be happy to sit down and discuss your plans. but in the meantime those women responsibility I've made some real headway in ending this thing without any more blood shed. And I certainly don't intend to stop now. So if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go back to work. Burdett's people have gone. We're clear for now. We've got a problem. That woman wants to take over. She wants to assault the house when her people get here. We do anything to stop her? Let's get some buddies down here and get the work for us. You call SBI you get a SWAT team down here. A lot of people here want to see you fall on your face. If you call on outside help that's gonna make them think that you can't handle it. Look. I can worry about that. I just don't want those 2 women to get killed. Now you get on the phone. Yes, sir. Sorry I blew up at you tonight I didn't mean it. I know you didn't, darling. It hurts me I think of mom and dad. Of course it does. It hurts me too. I keep thinking if it wasn't for me they'd still be here. They wouldn't have been in that car. There are lots of things we'd like to change. Thank you. Thank you. This is just beautiful. I love it. You are like a little jester. You always try to make things better. What do you mean I've lost my SWAT team? We are sorry, sheriff. Can't you handle it with your department? I guess I don't have any other choice, do I? just told me he found Burdett's pickup down the road in some bushes. No sign of Vern. We're bad in a thousand. SBI just cancelled our backup request, Burdett's running around loose and our woman from DoD is playing Rambo. Where is she anyway? Talking to Hawks again. That boy is gonna get himself into a world of trouble. So what's our game plan? I'm going back in. You need cover? I need cover from what's out here. All right, gentlemen, the sheriff is reentering the house. Where are you going, sheriff? We'll talk when I come back. You can't go in there. They're gaining control over those women. It's obvious. They'll do the same to you. I don't think so, lady. I'm overruling you on that, sheriff. You'll endanger all of us if you go back in. You don't have any authority here. So just back off. Mrs. Clark! This is sheriff McMahon. I'd like to come back into the house. I was just making some coffee. Would you like a cup? Thank you. Do they understand what we say? It seems so. I guess I'll just address this to everybody. I want you all to come into town with me. To the sheriff's station. I can better protect you there. You can't arrest them Not arrest them. I want to place them under protective custody. They can't do that. Why not? You have to let them go. I'm sorry, I can't do that. You must realize that our laws can't possibly apply to these beings. I can't just let anybody go, just walk away like nothing's happened. If you knew what we have seen, I think you'd feel a little differently. What the hell is going on in there? This is what I was afraid of. What? They're probably subjecting your sheriff to a form of mind control. Hold on, Ma'am. We don't know anything for certain but we can't take any chances. You should be prepared to take charge. To relieve him. You're trying to tell me that they got control of his mind? We've encountered it before. Get your men together while we still have time. Will you have them get away? Frankly, I don't know what I can do. It's not entirely up to me. There are other people involved. Let me just go out and see if I can negotiate some sort of resolution with this federal woman. I knew you'd help us. I'd have a much better chance of working something out if they would let the two of you go out with me as a sign of good faith. If we leave there's nothing to stop them from coming in and killing all of them. No, we're staying. Deirdre is right. We can't desert them. Cause when the sheriff comes out he ain't be the sheriff any more. She says those outer space people got control over his mind. The sheriff looks the same to me. No. He's acting kind of funny. Scott! Get me to the house and keep everybody else away from the house. Put him in that chair. Oh, my god. Deirdre, I need bandages. Scott! Get some assistance as fast as you can. Are you sure you're gonna be all right here? I'll be all right. Nobody comes in. This is gonna help. Step away from the window. Step away from the window! Quick! This way. Go find Deirdre. Don't let anything happen to my granddaughter. I won't. Don't worry. Jester. Stop, please. I can't leave grandma. Where are you taking me? What is this place? What the hell is that? Take that thing off. Put that down there, on the table. I said, you put that down and then you move away from the table. Fine. You can't wait. They'll kill you if they find you. I can't go with you. Deirdre, wait! But he's gotta go, is time. I can't just let him go. Why not? He's a witness. He's the proof that this isn't just some kind of craziness. You can't keep him for that. I've got to, it's my job. Freeze! Lord forgive me. Jesus! Sheriff, please. Let's go. Come on. I'll miss you. Wait! Grandma. Good bye. Did you hear? He called me grandma. Maybe it was the wind. He called me grandma. Anything's possible. I suppose. How on earth do you explain things like these? I don't know. The only way they could have just disappeared. Mrs. Clark, do you mind if I use a tape recorder? Could you please make this short? We haven't even gone to bed. You're Deirdre, the granddaughter. I heard that you had a lot of commotion here last night. Some unannounced visitors. After all the chaos how do you feel about that? I'm tired. Subs: hectorlahoz Ressynch: Kilo
