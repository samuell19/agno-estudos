(dramatic music) (mysterious music) - [Marilyn] Joe, stop, Wayne is bound to wake up soon. - [Joe] He's out like a light. I put two capsules in his hot chocolate. - Two, aren't those pills dangerous? - They're just sleeping pills. - [Marilyn] But you can overdose on them. - [Joe] I take two when I wanna sleep the night through. They never hurt me any. - [Marilyn] But Wayne's only 14. - Come on, Marilyn, it's Christmas. I can't think of any better way to celebrate. - [Marilyn] Okay, Santa. - [Joe] Bet you never made it with Santa before. (mysterious music) - (gasps) Wayne, put that down! - Calm down, son! I love your mother as, as much as your father did! - You can never compare to my father. - I'm as sorry as you are that he's dead! - I deserve a chance to be happy, Wayne, and so do you. - [Joe] No! (gun firing) (Joe grunts) (gun firing) (Marilyn screaming) (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) - A rinky dink .22? People insist on keeping these things in their homes. So she keeps it in the drawer loaded, right? Kid gets hold of it, pow, pow, pow. Merry Christmas, Mommy. Merry Christmas, Uncle Joe. - That was the kid's uncle? - His father died three years ago, and apparently the boy, Wayne, never got over it. Hates anybody taking Daddy's place with Mommy. - Oedipus complex. - That's what the shrinks will say, suckers. You know, like sticking a label on it gives him an excuse for his piss-poor behavior. So he'll do some time in juvenile detention. They'll have to let him go when he's 18, He'll be back blowing people away. - [Cop] Same old story.

Right to the camera. I love it. (lively music) I love it. Looking good. Bring the reflector in. The camera's your lover. That's great, Laura, that's great. - [Reporter] Would you mind holding this right here. - Oh, no, no, not at all, here, how's that, sure. - Thank you. This is Diane Heller, Channel 9 Showbiz News, and I'm talking with Bruce Brunswick, publisher of Girly Magazines, and producer of what is commonly called T and A videos. Not politically correct, and entirely too risky for us to show you any of the newest video being shot here today under the unlikely title, "Scream Queen Christmas". - Well, whether you realize it or not, Diane, there's a huge market for the stuff we do. And it's all good, harmless fun. "Scream Queens Illustrated" is kinda like um, Playboy come to the horror genre. From the magazine then we branched out into videos, and films, so forth. - So you're getting rich off of this, this crap. I mean that's what some people call it. - (chuckles) Well, not exactly. - Not exactly getting rich? - Not exactly crap. - Oh, what do you call it then? - It's a tasteful presentation of horror movies, horror movie makers, and horror movie starlets. The girls have beautiful bodies, and normal, healthy guys enjoying looking at them. We're helping them launch and sustain their careers, and they know it. They're not just a bunch of brainless bimbos. I'll prove it to you. Raven, come here, honey. - Hi. - Diane Heller, meet Raven Quinn. - Hi, how are you (giggles)? - Raven's the star of our little production, "Scream Queen Christmas". - [Raven] Mm hmm. - Ah, incidentally, the term Scream Queen was originally coined for Raven. Tell the folks out in TV land what your college degree is in, honey. - I have a masters in zoology. - You're a zoologist? - Yes, well, my husband, Eric, he's a glamor photographer. - Shoots a lot of our nude portfolios. - Right, well, he talked me into posing before we were married (giggles). And then um, I just had such a huge fan following, the movie offers started flowing in and here I am. - [Bruce] And she can act, not just look good. - By showing as much skin as possible? - Hey, look, a lot of people like looking at skin. - That's right. - Especially if it's wrapped around the right kind of package. ♪ Scream Queen, your looks can mesmerize ♪ ♪ Scream Queen, of you I fantasize ♪ ♪ Scream Queen, a terror so sublime ♪ ♪ Scream Queen, scare my pants off anytime ♪ (heavy metal music) (suspenseful music) - Oh, what a Christmas gift. (suspenseful music) This is gonna be the best Christmas ever. (suspenseful music) Now you're officially mine, Raven. I'm your, I'm your biggest fan? (suspenseful music) Merry Christmas, Raven. (suspenseful music) - [Raven] Hi, Laura. - Hi, Raven. What's your scene you're shooting today. - I'm actually not shooting a scene today. I just came in to sign a contract. - You don't seem like yourself today at all. - I know, I just had a fight with Eric. He left on Saturday for photo shoot in Akron. Says he's not gonna come home. He's gonna file for a divorce. - Ouch, sorry to hear that. Do your kids know? - No, I haven't figured out a way to tell them yet, you know? Guess I'm kinda hoping I won't have to. - [Man] Laura Britton, wanted on the set. - Great Christmas present, huh? - [Man] Laura Britton, you're on. Camera's ready to roll. - Well, I gotta get back on the set. (suspenseful music) - Good luck. (suspenseful music) (Raven sighs) (suspenseful music) I'm so pleased to have such a strong supportive fan like you, Wayne. I had no idea that you had so many souvenirs of me and my movies. - I just loved you in your last movie, "The Hooded Claw". I, I even got some props from the movie. (suspenseful music) Nobody loves you as much as I do, Raven. - I believe you, Wayne, I do. I believe you. (suspenseful music) Wayne, I'm so pleased. (lips smack) (exhales deeply) I'm so pleased, Wayne. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - [Savanah] Mommy! - [Angela] Mommy! - [Mom] Come on in, close the door. It's cold outside. - What're you kids doing? - You wanna come in for some coffee while they get their hats and coats on? - No, thanks, we gotta get going. Get your coats ready. Say goodbye to Grandma. - Eric phoned from Akron awhile ago. He wasn't too happy that you weren't watching Savannah and Angela herself. Not that we mind, but (scoffs). - What's wrong, he doesn't trust them with his own mother and sister? - Well, sure he trusts us. He just doesn't think that we oughta be doing your job. He makes no bones about it, Raven, and we agree. Now that you're the mother of two darling children, you really oughta look for a more dignified line of work. - Well, it's the same line of work that he's in. Besides he's the one who got me into it in the first place. - Yes, but he's on the other end of the camera. He doesn't go around showing himself. The kids aren't gonna open some sleazy magazine, and find him in there stark naked. - Why don't you kids play outside, okay? - I'll be there one minute. Do you got your dolls? I'll be right out, okay, honey? You said he called. Did he leave a number? - Oh, you must really be on the outs, if you don't even know where he's staying. - Did he leave a number or not? - It's by the phone. He's staying at the same motel where he's doing that fantasy girl shoot. (suspenseful music) You oughta know better than to bother him when he's working. - Now he said he can't take any calls till after six. (suspenseful music) - Hi extension 1602, please. (suspenseful music) Eric, hi, honey. I hope I'm not bothering you. Hello? Must've been disconnected. - (laughing) I don't think so, dear. He must have hung up. - He really hates being interrupted while he's working. He told us not to even give you the phone number. We know there's something wrong between you two, so don't even try to pretend otherwise. - All couples argue, and there's nothing wrong between us that can't be fixed, especially if his loving mother, and adoring sister would learn to butt out! - [Mrs. Quinn] Bad news. - Kids! (girls laughing and chattering) Savanah, Angela, come on. Let's go, girls. Here, take Fluffy, come on! - [Savanah] You and Grandma weren't fighting. - Hey, we weren't fighting, okay? Everything's all right. Now, come on. We're gonna go and put some Christmas decorations up, and get ready for Santa Claus, all right? (girls cheering) - [Angela] Santa. - Get in the car, buckle up. Good girls. You in there? (suspenseful music) - There, that should take care of that. Alright, are you ready to get started? Okay. (suspenseful music) (Eric gasps) - Eric, what's the matter? I thought we were really getting some good stuff here. - Yeah, yeah, we were, but ah-- - Who was that on the phone? - It was, ah, nobody, no, it was my wife. Soon to be my ex-wife. - Maybe she just doesn't appreciate you. - Yeah, well, maybe, but ah, nevermind that now. Let's get into what we're doing, okay? - Okay. - Come on, we can get it back. Now, show me what you got. Come on, Debbie. That's it, baby, come on. Beautiful, give me those eyes. Give me those big brown eyes. Oh yeah, sweetheart. That's, oh yeah. Like a goddess. Come on, make love to the camera, sweetheart. Oh, you're beautiful. Damn, you're heating me up now. That's it. Come on, baby, let loose now. Don't hold back on me, girl. Hey. (mysterious music) Yeah. Yeah, oh. (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) - [Wayne] Hey, look what I got! - Wayne, we were at Grandmas! - Oh boy, we don't have those for Christmas! - Mommy, may we? - Wayne, you're gonna spoil them. - (chuckles) I know, I shouldn't have. It's just a little inexpensive, early gift. - Yeah, I should say it's early. It's only one day until the Christmas vacation. - Then it's one day until their Christmas vacation present. All right, Raven? - [Girls] All right, Mommy, all right? - [Raven] All right, all right. - [Girls] Yay, thank you, thank you! - Wait a second, girls! Don't you need these to get in. So just hold your horses or your reindeer or whatever! Wayne, do you wanna come in? We're having some leftovers, and you can help us decorate the tree later. - [Wayne] I, I'd love to. - I really need to relax. I just had a huge fight with Eric's mother and sister. - Hey, are you on Venus or what? - (chuckles) I'm right here. - [Debbie] Mm. - What would you think if I told you ah, you're the first one? - (giggles) Come on, I'm not gonna believe that. You're a virgin, married with two children? - No, I mean other than my wife. You're the first one since I've been married. - Yeah, I'm not gonna believe that either. - Well, it's true. Listen, I've been in this business for 10 years, and I've never, ever slept with the talent. I've always wanted to stay married. - What makes you think your wife was so faithful? - (scoffs) Yeah, maybe you're right. - No maybes about it. You were a true blue sap. - Yeah, you're probably right. - You can take that to the bank. (lips smacking) (Eric and Debbie grunt) I'm gonna do you a big favor, Eric. I'm gonna make you forget about your wife, about your kids, and about your job. And the only thing on your mind from now on is gonna be me. ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ Fa la la la la, la la, la la ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ Fa la la la la, la la, la la (all laughing) ♪ Troll the ancient Yuletide carol ♪ ♪ Fa la la la la, la la, la la (girls laughing) - Very good, now let's-- - One more carol, Mom? - No. - Please, Mommy? - No, that was one more.

(mysterious music) I guess after with the fight I had with my in-laws today, they're not gonna wanna watch my kids anymore. I'll have to put them in daycare. - I'm sure they'd still wanna watch Angela and Savanah, wouldn't they? - Well, I don't know. I mean, they really don't like me. They were very much against Eric marrying me in the first place. They consider my movies about a half a step above porno films. - What about him? Don't they realize that he makes a living photographing not only you, but lots of other beautiful women in the nude. - Yeah, I know, but you see, that's okay if he does it, but it's not okay if he marries one of these types of girls. See, I think they love the idea that we may be getting divorced. I just have to be careful they don't turn my own kids against me. - You know, now that school is out for the holidays, I have two weeks vacation from my teacher's aid job. I'd be more than willing to babysit for you, if you need me to. - Aren't you sick of being around kids, Wayne? I mean, it's a nice offer, but-- - I, I like your children. There'd be no trouble at all. They're not like the rowdies I have to deal with down at school. - Well, you know I do have a dinner appointment with my producer tomorrow night. If you wanna give it a shot, you can. - Sure, sure, I'd love to. You know, what is this "Scream Queen Christmas" you're doing? What's it all about? - Well, it's, it's a 60 minute video. It's not a feature film. And it's basically an excuse for a bunch of horny guys to watch a bunch of naked women (laughing). It has about zero plots. It's about this magical snowman, and he casts a spell on this group of guys, and they all wake up in the morning on Christmas, and they have the girl of their dreams under the tree. So I play one of the girls. I pop out of this Christmas package, and I'm in this sexy little outfit. - And then you-- - Get naked, of course. That's what they wanna see. - Doesn't that, doesn't that bother you? - No, why should it? - I mean, thinking of what all those guys are doing while they're watching you. - Well, I don't think about that. It's a lot of fun for me, and I make a lot of money at it. - How about the guys on the set? Don't they get turned on watching you? Like, like, like that producer friend of yours that you're going out with tonight. - Wayne, you know you're starting to sound like my husband, and I don't appreciate it. Let's just drop the subject, okay? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I guess I was being a little nosy. Sometimes I can't help it. You're my friend and I worry about you. - I don't know. I just (sighs), I guess I just got used to it more and more as time went on, you know? Just got used to the business. I enjoy being called a Scream Queen now, you know? I never would've dreamt I'd be doing this for a living. - Do you ever miss your old career? I mean, do you ever think you'll go back to zoology? - I don't know. You know, I must have the weirdest resume in the whole world. Raven Quinn, zoologist, actress, Scream Queen, wife, and mother. - [Wayne] Hmm. - And my husband thinks I'm failing miserably at the last two. - I think you're a wonderful mother, Raven. I'd love to have you as my wife and raise my children. - You know I'm actually very strange, don't you? I have a very dark side. You know when we were about 10 years old, all the other girls were playing hopscotch, and jump rope, and all this stuff, and I was out looking for road kill for dead rabbits, and possums, and (laughs) anything that I could like take home, and, and, and rip open, and figure out, you know? Well, I think it was very natural, because as a little girl, I just wanted to find out what makes living things live, you know? Even if it meant that I had to open up dead ones. Do you think that's weird, Wayne? - No, no, do you think I'm weird? - Yeah, really weird (laughs). I'm just kidding. Come on, what's wrong with you? I'm just, Wayne, Wayne, come back to me. I was just kidding. I'm just kidding. (suspenseful music) - How, how come you're home early today? Are they finished with filming the movie, "Scream Queen Christmas"? - Well, actually they're, I think they're shooting with ah, Laura tonight. - Laura who? - Laura Britton. - You and her did that, that "Hooded Claw" thing together. - [Raven] Mm hmm. - She got clawed to death. - Mm hmm, that's right. You know when I wasn't acting in the that film, I helped him with the special effects. We put so much blood on Laura, she stuck to the floor (laughing). Blood is really sticky. - Really? - Yeah. - It's that sticky? - Yeah, I mean all it is, it's, it's corn syrup with red food coloring. That's all it is. - You know, you know, I, I heard real blood's really sticky too. - Really, I wouldn't know. First, I, I get rid of your husband, and then we, then you say you wanna go with that sleazeball producer, that Bruce Brunswick character? Don't you realize all he wants is to get in your pants? Oh, oh sure, I'll babysit your kids while he lays you! What kind of fool do you take me for, Raven? (mysterious music) Don't try and treat me like you treat your husband. I won't stand for it! Nobody loves you as much as I do, Raven. (mysterious music) If you reject my true and honest love, then you'll get what's coming to you. (mysterious music) Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Huh, do you hear me? Do you hear me (screaming)? All right, Raven.

Now, get out there and do your Christmas shopping, go on! La la la, and all that jazz, you know. (door thuds) What, what, hey, what're doing?

You created me and I can never die! You've been a bad boy, a very bad boy (screams). (Wayne and Bruce growling) (claw thudding) (both grunting) (Bruce moaning) (heavy metal music) (Wayne panting) Oh, Raven, Raven. You should've saw the look on that sleazeball producer of yours face. He shot me here and here, and I just kept coming. He couldn't believe it. It reminded me, it reminded me of my Uncle Joe. (exhales deeply) It reminded me of Uncle Joe when I shot him. (mysterious music) I love you, Raven. I'll never let anyone, anyone harm you. (suspenseful music) - [Raven] Hey Wayne, what's up? - Hi, Raven, do you still need me to babysit tonight? Are you still going on that dinner date with that producer guy? - First of all, Wayne, it's not a date. I'm still trying to get back together with my husband, Eric. And I think the whole thing's been postponed, unless I hear otherwise. - From Eric? - No, from the producer, Bruce Brunswick. But no one's heard from him since he did that shoot with Laura Britton. It's like they both disappeared. - Maybe they eloped. - No, I don't think so (giggles). Bruce isn't the type. I mean maybe Laura, but not Bruce. - Well, well, love makes people do strange things, Raven. - Yeah, well, this is entirely too strange. Even the police think so. They've questioned all of us that have been shooting with Bruce. They haven't come up with any leads though. Unless they're not telling us. - Well, what about the shoot? Has it been scrapped? - Oh, no, no, no, the director's gonna be doing both his and Bruce's job. - I wish you all the best of luck. I'd hate for anything awful to have happened. - Oh, thanks. You have to do some Christmas shopping or something. - Actually, I have to drop a couple of things off that I've already gift wrapped.

What is it that you're not telling me? Are you seeing someone else? - No. No. - Well, neither am I. Eric, I want you back. I want to be with you. I want us to be a family again. - What have you told the kids? - Nothing, I just told them that you're out doing a shoot somewhere. I bought most of the stuff that they wanted from Santa.

Buy your own suit and find your own corner. This is my corner. Traffic's good here. Find your own corner or I'll black both of your eyes! You hearing me? (bell ringing) (suspenseful music) (heavy metal music) (suspenseful music) - [Clerk] Hi. - Hi. - [Clerk] Can I help you? - Yeah. How much? - [Clerk] $60. - That's perfect, I'll take it. - [Clerk] That's all right. - It sure is cold. - [Clerk] Very cold. - Do, do you think it will fit? - It fit very well. (light jazz music) (apple crunching) (light jazz music) - Hi, kitty, here. You hungry, kitty? Aw, Misty, what? (cat meowing) (mellow music) Kitty, where are you going? (cat meowing) What? Come here. (cat meows) Oh, I know. Hi, did you miss me, huh? (answer machine beeps) - [Ted] Hello, Mary Jane, this is Ted. I guess you're still on the set. I just called to say I love you. Isn't that a song title or something (chuckles)? It's Stevie Wonder I think. Anyway, I'll call later. Don't forget our date Saturday night. (answering machine beeps) - [Mom] Mary Jane, this is Mom. Are you there? I guess not. Give me a call. Let me know if you're coming for dinner on Sunday, you and Ted. Bye, honey. (answering machine beeps) (mellow music) (knocking on door) - Damn, that can't be Ted. (knocking on door) - Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas! (Mary Jane giggles) I'm here for the Ryan party! - No, there's no party here. I wish there was though. - Isn't this the Ryan's residence? I must've got the wrong directions! You know where the Ryan's live? - Nope, sorry, Santa. - Oh, their boy's gonna be so upset if I don't make it to the party on time! Do you think Santa can use the phone? I have the phone number! I just have to get directions! - I don't usually let anyone in when I'm here alone. - Ah, ho, ho, ho, it's Santa Claus! Surely you make exceptions for Santa! - Well, I guess. - Thank you, you're a real doll. Hi, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. - You can use that phone right there. - Actually, I have something better to use. I'm not gonna hurt you! I'm not gonna hurt you! Listen to me! Listen to me, Raven! Raven, I'm not gonna hurt you! I'm not gonna hurt you! Would you just listen to me? Listen, listen, Raven! I will never hurt you! I'll never hurt you, Raven. I love you. I love you. I love you. (suspenseful music) You're not Raven. You're not Raven. (suspenseful music) (Wayne moans) Why, why, why! You can't do that to Santa Claus! (Wayne panting) (Mary Jane whimpering) You can't never do that to Santa! (Wayne inhaling deeply) Ah! (Wayne exhales slowly) How did everything go? - Hi, it was good. I got a lot of stuff done, thanks to you, Wayne. - [Wayne] Really? - You know, I feel bad. I mean, you sure you don't mind looking after the kids? I mean a guy like yourself should be on a date or something. - No, not, not at all. I'd rather be helping you. - That's nice. - When you need my help anyway I can. I mean, that's what friends are for. - Did Savanah and Angela behave themselves tonight? - Oh yeah, I made them some hot chocolate, and I tired them out playing old maid. They actually fell asleep right here on the couch. I had to carry them to bed. - Wow, you mean they went to bed early? - Yeah. - Wonders will never cease. You must have the magic touch there, Wayne. (suspenseful music) - Hey, I thought we still had another day of shooting? (mellow music) What's the matter? You just kept telling me what great stuff we were getting. Or was that just a line to get in my pants? - We got a lot of great stuff. You were great stuff, but it's over. - [Debbie] The shooting or us? - Both, look, you were great, but you can console yourself with the fact that you're gonna get a great layout out of this. - You're going back to her, aren't you? - Well, I don't know how it's gonna turn out, but you can be damn sure I'm gonna give it another shot. - Ha, back to the wifey, the little kiddies, home for the holidays and all that cornball crap, huh? - Look, I already checked out. I paid the bill. Just make sure you leave the key at the desk when you leave. (Debbie smacks lips) - Mommy, tell us again about that guy at the horror conviction in Baltimore. - [Angela] Yeah, Mommy, yeah. - What guy? - You know, the goofy guy who said he'd stop a bullet for you. - Well, honey, fans at conventions get a little crazy. I was standing in the lobby of a hotel, and this fan comes up to me. I was having a drink and he started getting so crazy. He asked me to sign his baseball cap. (girls laughing) He asked me to send his T-shirts. He even asked me to sign his beer bottle. - Then what did he say, Mommy? - Then he told me he would do anything in the world for me. And I tried to calm him down. I said, "Listen, mister, I'm just like anyone else. "I'm just a regular person like you." And he wouldn't hear it. He kept telling me over and over and over again how, how he would stop a bullet for me. - Does that mean he'd die for you? - Yeah, that's what he was trying to say, but you know, he was just drunk, honey. He didn't mean what he was saying. He was just excited about being around a celebrity. - But you're not a celebrity. You're just Mommy. - I know, honey, but to the people who like horror movies, I am a celebrity. Whether you know it or not, your mommy has fans all over the world. - But what if they could see now in blue jeans, and with your hands in dirty dishwater? - Well, I don't think they'd believe it. It'd ruin their fantasies. - But Daddy knows you do dishes, and he still likes you, doesn't he? - Yeah, and I still like him. - When's Daddy coming home? - I think he'll be home in a couple of days, honey. Now, listen, Mommy has to go the movie studio tonight, but Wayne's gonna come over and babysit, okay? - [girls] Yay! - So you're gonna be good for him, right? - [Girls] Yeah! - Good, I'll bring you home something nice. (spray can rattling) (Wayne whistling) (spray can hissing) - Raven, what are you doing? You can't improve upon perfection. - Oh, thank you. That's why you're my favorite director. - Oh ho, yeah, I believe that. Listen, ah, yesterday we shot the guy, okay? - [Raven] Mm hmm. - Reacting to the fact that you weren't there for his Christmas present. - Right, mm hmm. - Okay, I need a shot of you-- - [Raven] Mm hmm. - [Al] Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - Striking a pose. Instead of coming out of a box, we're gonna shoot it another way. - Okay. - Okay? - Yep. - Okay. - I'm just gonna pop and appear and that's it. - Yeah, it's, you're going to love it. - Okay. - It's gonna be a lot different than the coming out of the box type of thing, okay? - Right, okay, good, good. - Look, I'll tell you what we're gonna do, Raven. - [Raven] Mm hmm. - We're gonna lock the camera on the tripod, and we'll shoot the set without you on it, okay? - Right. - Then we'll have you pop in with that pose. - [Raven] Mm hmm. - You know, just a, yeah, you know? - [Both] Something sexy. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay, mm hmm. - Okay. - No problem. - And then we'll take it into the editing suite. - [Raven] Mm hmm. - And we'll do the ah, sudden appearance of you with a lot of splash and sparkles, okay? - Great, mm hmm. - And it'll look wonderful. - Excellent, let's do it. - Okay, wait till I get set here. - Okay, just start with the pose. Al, could you just take this? Thanks so much. Great, okay. - Okay, are you ready? - Okay, you ready? Ah, okay, and. - Action. - Ta-da! - Great, I love it.

Yeah, well, the kids look like they've been drugged. I can't even wake them up. Do you have any idea why she'd leave them like this? - We haven't heard from her for a week and a half. She never asks us to babysit anymore, but I got to worrying and I called over there today, and your next door neighbor, that Wayne fellow, answered the phone and said he was babysitting, and that the kids were fine. - Well, where the hell is he? - I don't know. Are you sure he's not still there? Maybe he's upstairs asleep, or ah, maybe ran next door for something. - Mom, nobody's here. I'm the only one here. I never trusted that little punk anyway. If he was supposed to be babysitting, then he drugged them. He doped them up. Please, can you and Peggy get over here right away? - Oh, certainly, son.

He's on his way over here, but, but I haven't heard from Raven, and that, that freak, Wayne, seems to have vanished too. - Well, do you suppose they could've run off together? - She'd never do that. No matter what else she is, she isn't evil. She's just selfish. She'd never do anything to hurt those children. - Then where the hell is she? - She might be at the film studio where they make the silly Scream Queen videos.

(man gasping) - [Eric] Raven! - Eric, I thought you were in Akron? - Yeah, yeah, and you thought your next door neighbor, Wayne, was watching the kids too. What else did you think, Raven? - What are you talking about, Eric? Wayne is babysitting the kids, isn't he? - Wayne drugged the kids and he's disappeared! God only knows what's going on here! - Well, who's watching the kids. - Well, my mother and sister over, and Dr. Branstetter's on his way, but I hope to God everything's okay. I wanna know what the hell's going on here, Raven. And you've got some explaining to do. - I just, I have to just get changed, Eric. My car's in the parking lot. - Leave your car here. You come home with me. We have some things to straighten out, before we can decide on where we're gonna go from here. - [Wayne] Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas! - Who the hell is this? (Wayne laughing maniacally) Who is it? - [Raven] Is anyone there? (Wayne laughing maniacally) - [Wayne] Ho, ho, ho, Raven (laughing maniacally)! - Wayne, is that you? - I'm not Wayne. I'm Santa Claws! - Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, stop. Think about what you're doing. - Santa Claws knows what you want for Christmas, Raven!

Raven, you're turning me into the Scrooge. - Please, don't, I'm begging you. Please don't do this (crying). I'm your friend! Wayne, please, please! You gotta call the cops and turn yourself in! - [Wayne] You know, Wayne's mother used to always tell him to turn himself in, you see, so if you're gonna turn on Wayne, then Santa Claws is gonna have to kill you. - [Raven] No (crying), no! - Wayne, leave my wife alone! - That's what you always did, isn't it, Eric? You always left her alone, taking pictures of naked women! - No, no! No, no, no! (men grunting and growling) (heavy metal music) Don't! Don't!
