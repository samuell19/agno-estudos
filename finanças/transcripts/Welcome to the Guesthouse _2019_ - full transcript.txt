Damn. I wanna go to Bali. Its tropical warmth awaits me. Stop it already. Dammit. When people think of surfing, I bet they think that's how it's done, huh? That's why newbies learn to surf in the summer, yet there aren't many waves then. Trying to be all that. It's cold as hell outside, but what the hell? There's nothing like riding a winter wave. WELCOME TO THE GUESTHOUSE Mom: Did you call? I'm busy. Business is down lately. You at the dorm? Mom: I assume you are doing alright. Both your studies and job hunting. How's it going? Looking for a room for the winter? Pardon? Bro, can I get a hot coffee? Too tired. Make it yourself. You should've seen the size of the wave I rode today. Double overhead. High as a 4-story building. Yeah, whatever. Got ourselves quite the surfer here. Hey, hey. Trust me, man. It really was that huge! Right? You saw it. - Yeah... - See? He saw it, too! It's usually livelier than this around here. Anyway, let me go change. Make yourself at home. Can't any one of you work part-time? I want to go to Bali for a bit. Didn't I warn you you'd end up having to hire someone? We paid for our rooms for the whole winter. - I beg to differ. - What? Won-jong, my man! It's not as simple as you say, sir. You think so too, right? Atta boy! What the hell are you talking about? I am not trying to negotiate my salary or anything. Huh? Of course I'd appreciate it if you could match my previous job's salary, but more importantly, I want to be acknowledged for my abilities. Yes, that's correct. Yu-na, you should do it. I'll pay you for this easy-peasy job. Nope. I would prefer not to. Come on! You get paid for doing easy work, plus I let you sleep here. Stop watching videos of Bali! Bo-mi keeps uploading tons of them! I... I want the job! - For real? - Yes! Internet cafes, coffee shops... I've worked all kinds of jobs. I'm positive I can do it. Alright. How well do you surf? Looks like you ride a shortboard. Short... pod... what? - Sorry? - What? Never surfed before? So what? Who bothers to learn surfing in the winter? No newbies try it out in the winter, so your part-timer doesn't need any surfing skills. All you need is someone to look after the place. But still... Yo, Ki-hoon, what are you guys talking about? There are plenty of rooms left. He's here to work. Not as a guest. Work here? Wow, that'd be great! - Right? - Sure! Someone who's willing to make coffee and turn on the boiler! - Wouldn't that be great? - But hey, he ain't much of a surfer. Surfer? You are too harsh. Only the basics will do. Right? You've never done it before, I see... Then why do you have... Oh, this thing... well... Current time Winter Semester Course Registration Damn... Hee-seung! You got into both classes? - Yes. - Can you give me one of them? No way, dude! I have to boost my GPA. I'll get kicked out of the dorm if I can't get into a single class. Please. Keep refreshing the page. Maybe someone will drop a class. I'm off, dude. So you didn't get into any classes for the winter? Still, they can't kick you out of the dorm for that. Nope. You have to register for a class. If I don't get into any classes, I'll get kicked out of the dorm. And it's winter... Do it when the second registration opens up. If I get into a class then, can I stay in the dorm? Nope. I really dedicated to my studies. I know my GPA is not that high, but I did stay up many nights. My friends thought I was insane at how much work I put in. I am the very definition of a model student. Could there be any way around this? - Nope. - I see. Exactly. That's frustrating. Did you talk to your advisor? There is no other way. That's your problem. How's your job search going? Professor Lee Dong-ryul Don't try to put off your graduation. Do whatever it takes to get a job. Yes, sir. - No, I mean... - So consider this an opportunity and go to Seoul and give it your all. What could you possibly do here? Are you nuts? You're not even past the screening phase. And what made you think going to Seoul would change anything? Do you even know how expensive Seoul is? A semester's worth of room and board here is the same as the rent in the cheapest part of town. After 6 years of college life in Gangwon-do, you still don't know how the school works? Snowboarders battle like crazy for dormitory spots for the winter semester. If they got money to snowboard, doesn't that mean they can afford a place to stay? Greedy pigs. And as for me, I'm gonna be starving if I don't get a job soon. Looking for a room for the winter? That Tae-woo. Being Mr. Know-it-all again, huh? What? Why do you say that? Being nosy is my thing, man. Why are you embarrassing me in front of the guest? Well, I feel for the guy. Go to Bali, dude. I'm sick of hearing you say Bali this Bali that every second. This must be a sign to go to Bali. There won't be any more guests anyway. There's a wetsuit in the other room. Try it on. Yes, sir! - Wait, please. - Huh? Come over here. Put this on. Safety purposes. Also, you should always record your practices. - Thank you very much. - Go get 'em! Thank you very much. I'll only say this once, so listen carefully while you stretch. - Yes, sir. - This is a shortboard. It is six feet or under. Longboards are over 8 feet. This is called a foam-board. It has high buoyancy, which makes it perfect for beginners. Before you get in the water, check to see if anyone is there. If the waves look good but nobody's there, there's a reason. Either the current's too strong or there could be rocks hidden and such. Since there aren't many people in the winter, it is best to ask one of the shops nearby if in any doubt. Hey, are you listening? Yes, sir. Lie down. What the hell are you doing? That's how you're gonna surf? I'll bet a caramel macchiato that he won't stand up on the board today. I'll bet a Cafe Latte for it. Yeah? Well, that ain't gonna work. Fine. I'll bet that he does stand up on the board. When the waves come at you, put your hands around your chest and lift your upper body! Damn it, what's wrong with him? I guess I'll just surf until he gets here. Well, well, well. You finally made it. What did I tell you to do when you get to the lineup? - To say, "Hello." - Good. Always greet first thing. You look exhausted already. - You gonna be OK? - I'm good. Let's give this a try. While paddling, I'll shout "up". That's when you take off. Do you remember the take off? - Yeah. Standing up. - Good. Front foot first and then the back one? - Back foot. - Great. Now paddle! - Paddle! - Faster! Give it all you got! Up! Up! Take off! Up! Sir, my feet don't reach the floor anymore. It's better that way. You won't hit the floor if you get wiped out by a wave. Can I take a break? Break? From what? I've paddled too much... Paddling ain't surfing. Can you name one thing that you are good at? Something you are proud of? That's what I thought. Go on back to the guesthouse then. I'm gonna ride one more wave. I guess I'm not going to Bali, and you'll be homeless and will freeze to death. No sir! I can do it! I'm good to go! You should go to Bali! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! - Are you sure? - Positive! You really mean that? Yes, I do! Good job. Huh? I haven't stood up yet. That's it for today. Not many people get up on the first day. Let's do it again tomorrow. You still have a lot to learn, so go get changed. Alright, I'll show them. Oww, my shoulder! I don't feel too great. Not really up for surfing. Chickening out? - What? - No way. That wave isn't even that big. No kidding, man. Yo. How many consecutive days has Jun-geun been surfing? About two weeks? I didn't think he'd keep practicing after Ki-hoon left for Bali. I'm impressed. But the thing is, he is a very slow learner. I concur. Pity he just can't get up. What? What did you just say? - What are you implying? - Who? Me? Come over here Jun-geun. Jeez... Hey, Jun-geun. Do you know what it takes to be good at surfing? Answer me! Surf well? Yeah, to be a good surfer, what is it that you have to do? I don't quite get what you are getting at. Jeez... Okay. Look. - Can you see that swell? - Yep. Do you think it's possible to catch it? It is? Wrong. - Ah, it's not. - Nope, it isn't. That's why you're exhausted. Keep looking. You can only ride waves that have a slope. - Got it. - Look at that. See what I'm saying? If the wave is not steep enough, you can't ride it no matter how hard you paddle. How about that one at the back? That looks doable. - Damn right. - I see. Notice those big swells? Ones that consist of 3 or 4 waves we call them "set waves." Go for the set waves for now since you're a beginner. That helps you save your strength. To be sure, just let the first wave go. There will be two more in the set. Got it. Surfing is about making a good choice. - Okay? - Yep. Damn, it's cold. Let's get some coffee. - Too cold. - It's freezing! - Warm yourself up. - It's freezing. My toes are frozen. - It gets worse. - Hello! Huh? Can I get some coffee? Sure! Two Cafe Latte, please. Two Cafe Latte. Got it. Driver's license / Choi Ji-ho What's that doing there? Here. By the way, what sunscreen do you use? Oh, here! No sunburns with this one. I'll take it then. - Really? - Yes. OK, just a sec. Damn... is this for sale? Whatever. Here you go. Done. The coffee? Right! Here you go. - Thanks a lot. - Have a good day. Oh, hello, ma'am! You're leaving? Nice meeting you! Dude, did you see her? What a gorgeous woman. Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Typical case of plastic beauty. Why didn't she ask for accommodations? Tell me about it. I can't believe they parked right in front of the surf shop. Can they do that? Could they be any ruder? They should've asked us first or parked a little further down. What a jerk. It's unthinkable if you work for a conglomerate. Unless you're the CEO's family. Seems like they've seen too many movies. Camping in the winter? Seriously? The moment they litter, I'll whip their asses. Way to go, Yu-na. The environmentalist and guardian of the ecosystem. - Sea Bird. - It's Sea Shepherd! Look at that. How many selfies has she taken so far? Why wear the suit if not going into the water? Is she an Instagram model? Well, I was once in charge of social media strategies... Zip it. Yu-na, let's check if she's got an Instagram account. That's your thing. Hell no. What kind of medicine is that? Leave it to me. I only need a few sec... Found it! See? An expert. Wow. This was taken today. Attention, whore alert! Surfing with all her make-up on? You've got competition, Yu-na. Look at how many followers. There's 33,000. A little cleavage and a smile. It's that easy to get followers. Mine's big enough, thank you very much! Not too sure how you'd do on Insta... Gonna get another practice session in. You sure? - Aren't you tired? - I'm alright. Shall we go too? For real? Well... - I'm just floating the idea. - My point exactly. Damn straight. How's it going? Rich prick. Won't even acknowledge a fellow surfer. Where the hell is my sunscreen? My brand new, high-end sunscreen... Wow... looks like a battle. Yeah? No kidding! It's just those two. Can't see clearly from here. Damn it. Hey! Why isn't he turning his board? I told him to go for the second wave in the set. Not now, though! He should've gotten the upper hand! So thick! Sure gave him great advice. What a disappointment! How could I have known this would happen? You always pick on me. You try teaching him then! He missed it! He missed the wave! What's he doing? What's up? What happened? What? He missed? What an ill-mannered young man! If he missed the first wave, he should give up the second one. I bet that spoiled brat learned to surf at some private resort. The man's got no sense of etiquette. Whoa! Watch out, Jun-geun! Pull out! Don't catch it! Hey! Get lost! Jun-geun! Let's go! Boy, that brat is insane! Jun-geun! Young man! - Jun-geun! - Jun-geun! - Jun-geun! Are you okay? - Are you hurt? - Did you get hit by the board? - That was extremely dangerous. - Do you feel okay? - This is why you need insurance. - Insurance is a must! - Excuse me. Why did you go straight? That was dangerous. If you can't surf, don't bother trying to catch the wave. Hey, man! You should have let the second wave go... - Stop. Stop. I'm sorry. Stop! - Stop Yu-na! That's enough! How about I teach you some manners! The wave broke to the left. I didn't drop in. What did I do wrong? Come on! That's enough! Cool it! You're aware there's a rotation. If you missed the first wave, you should've let the second wave go. I thought for sure he wouldn't be able to catch it. Does he even know how to take off? What? You want a piece of me? Honey! Are you okay? There were only two of you in the lineup. I'd understand if it had been crowded. What's with the greed? Who learns surfing in the winter? He should've practiced on his own more before trying to surf with others. Watch your mouth, you prick! You're unbelievable. Like you surfed like a pro right from the start! I got private lessons when I started surfing in Hawaii. Never made a nuisance of myself. Good for you that you're so rich. Guess they didn't teach you surfing etiquette, huh? Enough, honey. Let's go. I wasn't talking to you. Why do you keep interrupting? If you have a problem, how about we have a battle to settle this? Really? Come on. The loser never sets foot on this beach. Are you out of your mind? You want a battle? Pick on someone your own size! No, young man! You against me! Enough of this already. Why are you stooping to their level? - "Our level"? - "Our level"? You wanna wrestle in the sand too? Stop shouting. - Go away! - Alright! Let's battle. - Jun-geun! - Dude! Are you thinking straight? You can't even do a proper take-off. - This is ridiculous. - You know I'm in your corner. But I'm not sure about this. Let's battle! The loser leaves this beach for good! Alright. Deal. - Let's get it. - But! Let's do it in a month. What? A month later... I said. I know an ISA certified judge who's supposed to be here a month later. - Right, Tae-woo? - Huh? - A month later, right? - Oh, right, Albert! He's a fine judge. We'd be three against one since it's just your girlfriend, so I wouldn't call that fair judging. I used to work for a conglomerate. You can trust me. Scared of losing and leaving this place now, huh? But why should I wait for a whole month? I'll give you coffee. What? Coffee for free, I said. Why? Why did I do this? Was I crazy? What the hell was I thinking! Please, masters. Train me. Help me win! Surfing isn't a type of sport you can learn fast. I thought you said what you said just to avoid the situation. Why do you say that? The man's got pride. I actually admire him for it. I'll do whatever you say. I can't beat him alone. Then... If you raise the temperature of the boiler by... 3 degrees, then I'll think about it. Sure! Ki-hoon said he'd kill me if I touched the boiler, but who cares! Well, then... can you serve us coffee every day? Sure! I'll just say I drank 3 cups of coffee a day! Not a problem at all. You do know we're doing this for the right reasons, right? - Of course. - Good. Consider it an act of generosity for the wretched youth. Stand up, Jun-geun. We want to crush that prick anyway. - Me too. - Yu-na is right. Let's teach him a lesson. I will come up with your training routine. When it comes to the theoretics of surfing, I do know my stuff. Thank you, Master. If you're going to do this, you must win. Let's tell the other surfers about this battle. Then your back's gonna be against the wall. - Leave it to me. - Sure. T.I.L.F! To Infinite Love and Friendship! What the... Moron. Rise up, mighty warrior. Let's go! Jun-geun! Run! Perfect. Just look ahead. Don't look down! Think of the prick whose ass you're gonna kick. Come on! Move those legs! Up! Don't push your butt out. Nope. Don't jump. Never jump. Stop jumping! Surfing Deathmatch, Jun-geun training footage #4 Lower your stance. Up! Again. Up! Look how hard they are training. No jumping! Stop whining. At 5:30 am, take the first bus to the Jumunjin bus terminal. Welcome aboard. Don't even think about it. Here we go. Hold on tight, please. Hey, man. You gonna be able to stand up anytime soon? What am I going to do with you? What's with them? Are they leaving? How many sweet potatoes are there in the boiler? Three. Let's have one. Hello! Yup. Are you going back to Seoul? Yeah. We are going to Taiwan. Oh... It's too cold to surf here. I see... See you when we get back. Going overseas to train, huh? I guess money does talk. Is Taiwan that nice? Warm, glassy waves, not crowded, what more can I say. The waves here in Gangwon-do ain't so bad either. Come on. It's not as good as the waves in Taiwan though. Holy crap! - What's wrong with you? - What the... The clip I uploaded on YouTube. What? 50,000 views? Isn't that something? How long has it been since you've uploaded it? Last night, so not even a day. Wow. Damn! Oh, you shouldn't have! Hey, Jun. Losing is not an option now. I'll kick your butt if you lose. You better win. That's an order. Please God... Hey! Alright! Alright I'll win! What's wrong with her? Hey! Open the door! Open up right now! What is it this time? That garbage bag. That was you, no? Nope. Don't play dumb. In the name of Sea Shepherd, there's not a chance I'll let this slide. Whoa, watch out! She needs to watch out. If you wanna leave, you better run over me! What surfer litters on the beach? - What is Sea Shepherd by the way? - Get out. Right now! You know Greenpeace, right? It's like Greenpeace on steroids. - Something of that sort. - Alright. I'll pick it up. - Don't leave anything behind. - A bit radical. No, it's called passion. I'm picking it up. See this? Satisfied? Yeah. Wait. What about that over there? - What? - Look over there. Where do you mean? Isn't that also trash? - Where exactly are you pointing? - Over there. Look carefully. Where? See ya! Hey! Stop! You're dead meat! Hey! You piece of crap! Come back here! You jerk! - Are you alright? - You scumbag! Are you okay? - Are you hurt? - Are you okay? You useless bunch. You good-for-nothing fools! That punk. - Hey. - Yu-na. Hold on, Yu-na. Let me give you a hand. Forget it! Learn to eat crap first. At least then you'd be as useful as a septic tank. Professor Lee Yes, sir. Jun-geun! How is life in Seoul? The job search going alright? It's going. Any good news? More students are postponing their graduation, biding their time to land a job at a conglomerate. You know, the NGs. "No Graduation." Remind you of anybody? Just kidding. Anyway, for those students, we created a bridge program between academia and employers. I'm actually in a position to recommend a few students. And I put in a good word for you. Huh? Oh, understood, sir. What is it? You don't like it? Would you prefer that I offer somebody else the opportunity? No, no, no. I'm just a bit surprised. That's all. OK, then. The program's gonna get you an interview without going through paper screening. Send me your resume and cover letter by tomorrow. Prepare thoroughly for the interview. I'll contact you when the date is set. Okay? Got it, sir. Thank you very much. Alright then. What the hell are you doing? Yo, Jun! Back so early today? Yeah... I'd imagine you'd be tired by now. Take a break then. Current Affairs for Job Seekers - The 2016 Edition Would you like to delete the item? No Current Affairs for Job Seekers - The 2017 Edition What I would give for my family to be happy... Mom Yo, what's goin' on? Hi, there, Boss. Jun-geun here. Right, Jun-geun! Apa Kabar? What? "Papa"? By the way, how is Bali? It's perfect. I don't know how I managed to surf in Korea. It's paradise here. I see... So you don't plan on coming back sooner? Actually, I'm thinking of not going back. Sorry? Just kidding. I'll be back as scheduled. Wait a sec. Hey, Bo-mi. Sate Babi and a Sprite for me. By the way Jun-geun, do not mess with the boiler. Got it? Selamat Jalan. Wait! Boss!

It means a lot to me. Don't mention it. - Cheer up, honey. - Thank you. I normally don't drink unless I have to work. But man, this drink is damn good. What kind of work? You assumed that I'm jobless? I didn't mean that. I have to earn a living to surf. You may have seen his work. Magazine ads or video clips. That's why you are always shooting something. I'm working on a new surfing documentary film. You are the protagonist, Jun Snow. Me? I don't want to cause a nuisance. I used to work at a conglomerate as a marketer and... Do you always have to toot your own horn? Why not? - What about you, Yu-na? - Me? Wait. Take a guess. I'll bet that Jun Snow can't figure it out. - Same here. - I bet he can't. If Jun-geun guesses right, drink two shots. - Deal. - Okay, let me try. - Wait! I'll give you a hint. - Oh, hint! Don't make it obvious. Adult shop? - Nice guess, Jun Snow. - What a guess. You should be ashamed, Yu-na. Always making inappropriate jokes. I used to run an Internet shopping mall. You were a business owner indeed. Owner... Impressive. Not if your unsuccessful. There are more than a million Internet shopping malls in Korea. Wow. That's a lot. You can start one, too. Start with a blog market. No way. I don't have good taste. Young man. You are too timid already. At your age, you should take risks! Are you listening to yourself? A fogey or what? Show me your ID. Did I say something wrong? He has to get a job eventually, no? - Goddamn it, shut up old man! - You're right. I ain't old! I used to work at a conglomera... Hey! If you say "conglomerate" one more time... Huh? we're gonna ship you off on the fishing boat! Hey, shush! Let's listen to some music. Good idea! Package delivery. Korea Post Current Affairs for Job Seekers What does "Current Affairs for Job Seekers" have to do with surfing? I have a job interview. So I do have to prepare. So you weren't exhausted from over-practicing. You were distracted all along. I wasn't distracted. I need to make ends meet. It's hard enough doing one thing right. Why is surfing so difficult? I was talking about job seeking. I won't tell Won-jong and Tae-woo about this. They seem to care more about this than you are. But you're gonna have to make a choice sooner or later. My advisor arranged the interview for me and... Do you have to do everything he says? Of course. I have to graduate and also get a job. What about what you want? Isn't that more important than getting a job? That's different. My professor told me to do this. So if your professor asks you to stop surfing, would you? Why would he ask me to do such a thing? If he tells you to drop dead, would you? - Why would he say that? - What if he did? Would you say you have no choice? Your life is a series of choices you make. How is this a choice exactly? Why, why! I made this, but damn it's good! It's the best for getting over a hangover. It's got everything you need to cure a hangover. It contains kelp that's rich in magnesium and minerals. Here's shrimp, which has taurine. Anchovies, too. Beta-carotene and omega-3. And above all, Ta-da! This is vitamin powder. And that's my recipe for a perfect hangover ramen. How is it? Whatever. But it sure tastes good. Of course it is because I made it! Does it have any ingredients that make you smarter? Here is an anchovy. Rich in DHA and EPA! You've had your drink and your meat! You ready to step up your game or what? Your boss lives in Yangyang county. Right? I will make you stand up on the surfboard today for sure. That's right! Is there some special way to do it? No doubt. Stand up! Young man. Stand up! Enough talking! Think about Indo Board training. Wait. Wait. Wait. Enough waiting! Damn! Why the heck did I think to do this? I must have been still drunk. Even the company workshops were not as grueling as this. But I think this is helping. It better! I beg your pardon? Please let me give it another go! - Another go? - Yes! Okay. If you say so. Okay! Let's go! Rise up, mighty warrior! You looked good out there, Jun-geun! You got up easily! The training hasn't gone in vain. I owe it all to you, my masters. Don't mention it, good sir. What a humble young man! - It's freezing by the way. - Huh? Look at how he's tanned. He looks completely different. He must like tanning. Who is that next to him by the way? I've never seen him before. Isn't he a foreigner? Paddle. Paddle. Paddle out! Yeah, Seung-min! Nice ride! Hey! The better surfer doesn't necessarily always win. Who knows? He might catch a cold the day before the contest. Sure. He may have diarrhea on the day of battle. That's what I'm saying. Indeed. Nobody knows. And so what if you lose? It's not like he can stop you from coming to this beach. No, man. He's gotta keep his word. You can surf at other surfing spots. That's not an option. You must win at all costs. Shut the hell up! I... tried my best at everything. I studied really hard, but I couldn't get into a good college. I did my best at college. Worked odd jobs while studying. But my grades weren't good. You saw me, how hard I try, how hard and desperately... I trained. Perhaps... some are bound for success... and some are bound for failure. Don't talk like a loser. We are helping you. Why would you give up? Instead of putting him down, how about you try cheering him up? What I mean is, we've done our best to help him. Shouldn't we have a say in this too? Rather than whining, shouldn't he be thinking about winning? He's got a point, young man. Don't do it if you don't want to. Just raise the white flag. Walk up to that prick and say you want to give up. Man! I'm sick of this. Hey! Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself? Calm down, everyone. There's no need to raise our voices. I'm sick of listening to you, you old jerks! Am I wrong, though? If you don't have the skills, use the rule to your advantage. Giving up becomes a habit. You youngsters give up too easily! He is just frustrated because his surfing is not improving. Wait. I got it! Got what? There's this rule! What rule? We've agreed to go with the rules of national surfing competitions, so let's capitalize on those very rules. As you know, your skills alone don't guarantee victory. That's correct. You can be disqualified for violating rules. For real? Well, we haven't explained the rule to you yet. The incident you had with that jerk, for example, would actually be considered a penalty. Exactly! If riding the same wave, the wave belongs to surfer A, since he is closer to the peak. So... if B is in A's way while he is surfing... That's a penalty. You lose half of your points. Half? The judge scores every wave you ride, and the sum of the best two scores is your final score. But there is a penalty if you violate the rule. Let me elaborate. The judges score every wave you ride based on the size and the difficulty of the wave, the number of maneuvers you perform and how well you execute them. Your final score is the sum of the top two scores. But if you get a drop-in penalty, only the top score counts, in which case you're pretty much done. It would be game over for you. Look here. I'm A, meaning you, Jun-geun. B is that jerk. We are on the same wave, and I appeal to the judge that he is in my way. Genius! Jun-geun. You ready to kick ass? So there's a way for me to win? Damn right! T.I.T.S! Take the Initiative To Succeed!! You can win! But wait... Can Jun-geun surf sideways? Right... Oh, dammit. Huh? What's up? Look here. Say you're A. If you want to ride toward B, then what would you do? I have to know how to go sideways... Or how else would you use the drop-in strategy! Jun-geun! Look sideways! No, I said look sideways! Damn it. Don't look straight! I said don't! Look sideways when you take off! Look towards where you want to go. Right or left, not straight. Right or left, not straight. I'm trying, but the wave is moving too fast that I keep looking ahead. There's no obstacle in front of you. There's no reason to look at the front! Focus only on where you want to go! Then the board will turn on its own. I understand. What's that? You're a genius. This will do the trick. Indeed, it will. But isn't this too dangerous? Don't worry. Trust Won-jong. On my count. - One, two, three! - Wait, wait, wait! Up! Up! Up! Your body will remember how to take off. - You did it! - Great! Jun-geun! When the match starts, what do you do? Catch a wave first and surf. Good. And then? Get close to the prick and wait for the wave. Good. If the prick starts paddling? Check where the wave is, and if I'm closer to the peak, I paddle with him. Great. And if you're surfing the same wave? Keep my eyes on the prick only and surf toward him. Excellent! Very good, Jun Snow. Where is Won-jong though? - He went out to meet someone. - Job hunting maybe? Doesn't matter. Focus. If the surfboard gets close to the prick? What is the next step? No! You need to sell the acting. Make it convincing. Look how I do it. Damn... Impressive! What do you think? You really look like you've been victimized. Exactly! Sell that look of being victimized! That's how you appeal to the judges. Again. Ready, action! Nope! You're lacking soul. You gotta do better than that. Focus on your acting. Not surfing. Really put your soul into it. I'm allowed to make a sound, right? Of course! You're in the ocean. Cry out! Jeez! But what if I collide with the guy? Then you're done for. A surfboard on a wave can be extremely dangerous. Whether you crash into a surfer or into another board, that's the end of your life. Then, isn't it too dangerous to use this strategy? Nope. Don't be afraid. You can always jump off the board. Your body instinctively reacts to the danger first. Okay? If that happens, you'll find yourself jumping into the water. Okay. One more time. One, two... I'm back. It's freezing outside. Where have you been? - Welcome back! - Say my name. Who's the man? What are you talking about? Just wait. Looks old-fashioned. What is this? Ta-da. People have been asking why only two are taking part in the race. They requested that we start Korea's very first winter surfing competition. A competition? Are you sure you can handle an event that big? Of course! I already got the main sponsor. This will be my ticket to my next conglomerate job. - Trust me. - I'm not so sure about that. - Yes, sir! - Hi. What took you so long? I was training... I mean studying. Good. Keep up the good work. About the program I mentioned before, the interview date has been set. It's the 2nd of February. Pardon? The 2nd of February? Yangyang Winter Surfing Competition Date of main event: 2nd of February Actually, on that day... Something going on? Could it be possible to reschedule it... Reschedule? What are you talking about? Be at Gangnam station by 8:30 am. I understand, sir. Thank you. J.E.A.N.S! Just Enjoy And Never Stop! Do you ever stop? This is great beer. Jun-geun's treat, huh? You shouldn't have. We know you're living on a budget. Thanks a lot, kiddo. I... What? Hey, you serious? Don't you have any pride? Why did you ask for our help all along? I understand that you can't earn a living by surfing but... You're okay with what this guy's saying? He is shrinking from the battle under the pretext of some interview. Shrinking? He's given this much thought. Much thought? Are you kidding? I'm really sorry. Jun. Think this through again. You'll have more job interviews in the future. Easier said than done. Won-jong. Doesn't this bother you? You're really OK with him walking away? Of course I'm upset, but I also get that he needs a job. It must have been a tough decision for him. It wasn't easy for him to bring this up. So, you approve of this? It must be harder for Jun-geun than us. That's all I'm saying. Exactly. And in practical terms, it's not like he's gonna go pro anyway. What? Hey! Do you care only about yourself? And having this competition be another line in your resume? You're going too far. Please stop fighting because of me. What about you? Aren't you using Jun-geun for your documentary film? What the hell does my film have to do with this? Will you guys shut up? This was Jun-geun's choice! It's not up for you guys to decide. Could you not take Jun-geun's side for once? It's not like he's gonna give it to you anyway. - Hey! - Do you want a piece of me? Am I wrong? Say that again. I'll bust your head... Stop it, for god's sake! All of you! What is this really about? Do you even know my situation? I can't put food on the table as a surfer, no matter how hard I try. All of you have jobs. I don't. Yu-na, you've owned an Internet shopping mall before. Tae-woo, you're a photographer. Won-jong, you've worked at a conglomerate. Me, I've worked in bars and cafes. That's the extent of my work experience. I have to earn a decent living too! Don't you get that? The match is on the same day as the interview. Do I have a choice? You've had your run, but you won't even give me a chance at that! "What choice do I have?" Is that your motto? Yes. I've had my run, but why do you think I'm here? I guess it's true what they say. You have to see for yourself. Don't give a damn. Doing it my wave. Welcome aboard. Jumunjin Express Bus Terminal Gisamun beach has the best wave conditions. Be careful with those. Did you post a notice online? - Not yet. - Do it already. I know it takes place at Gisamun. Stop saying that. Damn, he looks like General MacArthur. I feel like I'm in Incheon. Jun-geun... I wonder how he is doing. Not interested. He made such a fuss. What a talent. Fool... Hello, everyone! Dragon Jae, 29 / YouTuber Here we are at Gisamun beach, which was chosen for the competition because of its wave conditions. Look at the waves. Glossy and smooth. But the wind is strong, so it will not be easy to surf. It is winter, so we should expect strong winds. You know what I'm saying? Competition, my ass. Wow. Quite impressive. Good job. The main event is at 12 o'clock, right? Yeah... sure... Where's the amateur? I don't see any other contestants. - Why not start now? - He is sleeping! He can kick your ass in his sleep. I don't think so. Did he skip town? Do you want another arm massage? No, thanks. If he doesn't show up until 12, I win by default. You can tell him to never come back here. Let's go. Jun-geun is not coming. Why did you say that? Now we'll have to see that prick gloat. Ah, whatever! I've done my part. - That temper... - Yeah... What was your biggest fear? How did you overcome it? Actually, I once went swimming with my parents when I was a kid. My father was away for a moment, and suddenly I got a leg cramp. My mother wasn't nearby either. I nearly died. You thought it was strange I don't surf, right? I don't like to brag, but... I'm a first-generation surfer in Korea. This one time, the waves were looking good. I was riding the hell out of them. Suddenly, I see a massive set wave coming at me. Definitely wasn't expecting it. It was a sneaker wave. I'd seen sneaker waves before. But this wave came out of nowhere. I wouldn't have been surprised if it hadn't been so huge. This one was insanely tall. Taken aback, I dove into the water. But... the leash got wrapped around my neck. So I'm getting swallowed up while the leash is choking me. Thought I was gonna die for sure. The mere thought of it still scares me. From then on, I've had aquaphobia. But... for some reason, I still find myself coming back to the beach. Jun-geun. You asked this before. Why do we, the old timers, give you a hard time yet you haven't had your run? - Yeah, about that... - See for yourself. No one can tell you what to do. You have to make your own life choices. Like I said, you gotta see for yourself. Just like how you can't know the true power of a wave... until you experience a wipeout. I'm not sure why the contestants are not showing up. I have no idea what's going on. God damn it. Damn this staff badge. I guess the livestream is a complete flop. A failure? Fair enough. An unmitigated disaster? Man, that's harsh. We still have the main event, so please stay tuned. Calm down, everybody. Could Jun-geun make it back after the interview? Are you out of your mind? He'd barely get here in time, even if he were to rush over here without even doing the interview. That wave size would be perfect for him. Just the right size. Hey, Won-jong! Is this gonna happen or not? Why is he making a fuss? I would skip town too if I were him. Should I beat him up? I don't know how much longer I can take this crap. Don't. No need to be a murderer. I didn't say I'd kill him. You deck him, he dies. I'm gonna go take a nap at the guesthouse... What? It's now time for the main event. The two surfers will ride the waves for 10 minutes. The sum of the top two scores will determine the winner. The 1st Yangyang Winter Surfing Competition. LIVE And the surfer in purple is putting on quite a performance right from the get-go. Smooth riding. Very good strategy indeed. Damn it! Jun-geun was closer to the top! First, just catch a wave! The drop-in strategy comes next! Go get 'em, Jun-geun! Kim Chun-sam, 57, Local fisherman Yangyang Elementary School Soccer Team What are they doing? Why do you keep coming closer? You think it'd make you surf better? Looks like they see a set wave coming. They're paddling hard. Pull out! Pull out! Jun-geun! The jerk is closer to the top! Jun-geun! Whew! What the... He is goofy footed. He puts his right foot forward? Is that so... He must like to surf to the left then. Hey! Jun-geun! Jun-geun! Get to the other side of the jerk! Move! Come on! Go away. Why do you keep coming closer? That's it! There you go! 3 minutes! 3 minutes left! What? That's it? Hey, you're the organizer! Get them to add 5 minutes! Good idea! Then I might as well just declare Jun-geun the winner! Always bragging about conglomerates but you're useless! We're running out of time. He better catch a wave. Packed your bags, right? - Here it comes. - Indeed! You gotta catch this one! Come on, Jun-geun! The surfer in purple is dropping in. There you go! He better pull out or he'll get a penalty. He has pulled out indeed. So close! Nice move by purple. He pulls out right in the nick of time. Hey! Wanna shut your piehole? Excuse me? Just shut it! Jun-geun! Get back in position! You are running out of time! All you got! It's not over yet! Yellow has surfed only one wave. Not much time left now. Too bad for him. Only 1 minute is left but it's completely flat now. Dear Lord, Dear Buddha, Dear Allah, Dear Muhammad, Dear Poseidon. Please give us a swell! And give Jun-geun the top of the wave! Amen! We beg of you! Won't you give up already? Staring ain't gonna get you a wave. Unbelievable! Here comes a sneaker wave! Alright! Alright! This is it! Here we go! The two are going at it again. Let's see who catches the sneaker wave. Uh oh! Watch out! The two are just a few feet apart. Purple's not aware. Lifeguard! Yellow's still underwater! Guys, yellow's still underwater. Lifeguard! Hurry! Hey! Who are you? You can't do that! Hey! Yu-na! - What the hell? - God damn it! Why aren't they out yet? There they are! Thank goodness. That's one hell of a woman! Right, guys? Look. Gotta say, she's awesome. What? She looks younger than me? Hey! I didn't even get to use my mouth. Stop breathing again! You pushed down on my chest too hard. Want me to knock you out? - No, thanks. - Jun-geun! Hey, young fella! Jun-geun! You okay? Can you stand? That appeal to the judges was fantastic. You're a goddamn artist! Are the scores out yet? Oh, right! Let's go see! And now everyone eagerly awaits the judges' decision, wondering what the scores will be. It's the moment of truth. All eyes on the scoreboard. Yellow needs a perfect score of 10 to tie. God damn it! This is so biased! Aren't they ISA certified judges? Those jerks! Hold up! What's going on? Wait! Wait! Something's up. Drop-in penalty! Yellow has scored higher. Yellow wins! Victory! What are we getting excited about? Whatever man! You said your hobby is wakeboarding. Are you good at it? Yes, I am. It was hard in the beginning because I had aquaphobia. I thought if cannot become skilled at something I love, there is nothing I can be good at. So, I did everything to get better at it. I think I can apply that mentality to this line of work. In... uh... this line of... I think I really like it. Surfing. I'm sorry? There's gotta be more to life than working in an office. Is that so? Well... he missed the interview for a surfing match. Damn millennials. Right? Sure, okay. Alright. Talk to you later. I mean... why didn't he just tell me he is a surfer? And now introducing, the legendary surfer, Lee Dong-ryul! Man! Who the heck touched the boiler? Hey, part-timer! Yo? Who am I talking to? Anybody?
