BLESSINGS You wasted my pass! Oh, sorry! - Toss it higher! - Come on, throw it out! Playing on the grass isn't bad, but playing on the sand is shit. You're getting exhausted so fast. I can run 200 more rounds. I'll do whatever I can. Fuck, you fell already? We've only played one game! Our team is dominating them. May all the spirits who watch over our homes always bring us good luck. Protect us from misfortune wherever we go, especially from traffic accidents. Bless us, so we win the upcoming dance competition. If we win, we'll offer you a chicken and seven types of fruit. Move to the side a bit. That's good. Jump. Open. Hit. And throw out your hands to finish! - My leg's sore! - Why are you always complaining? - Let's keep practising. - Give it all you've got! One more time. I'll watch first. - Try with a bit more energy. - You dance like a robot! My knee hurts. - What are you pushing so hard for? - Faster this time. I'm so tired. You're dancing like you haven't eaten today. Don't be so pushy! Chill, man. Try on your own. Her skin was so sexy. It was the first time I'd ever seen a woman naked. She was showering. She kept washing her body. I started feeling all hot inside. My heart was racing. Then this guy came out of nowhere. He interrupted the moment! How was I to know? You could have invited us. This motherfucker! I had no idea! He didn't warn me. He was calling for me so loudly. I was totally focused on her. Then he showed up. He barked, "What are you looking at?" She heard us and I tried to hide. When I looked again, she'd already gone. - It's your own fault. - You're so terrible. - Hey, what happened to her anyway? - Does she still live here? She used to live right near our building, in Dey Krahom. - I'm off. - Where are you going? Just call me. I'm going downstairs first. - But we're still practising. - I'll wait for your call. Are these shoes yours? My cousin in France sent them. They're so cool. - Are they for real? - Look at the box. Of course they are. Nice. How much are they? Try them on! They're perfect. Our feet are the same size. Excuse us! Clear the way! Can you sit still and drive carefully?! Check out the pretty vendor. - She's looking back at us now. - Hello! Bye! That building's so tall. I'm getting hungry seeing the food stands. Let's dance and make some money first. One day when we're free we should go for a boat ride. The boat leaves from the other side. Look at his face. Doesn't look good. So? The waiter said no. Let's find somewhere else. Hello everyone. My friends and I would like to perform for you a new kind of hip-hop dance. My friends and I, we're all orphans. We're dancing to earn money to support our studies. If you have a little money to spare... We have this small donation box. Thank you so much! Thank you! Brothers and sisters! Could you give just a little? Look, the waterfall keeps flowing, but it stays dry! That food on the screen looks so good. - Who knows? - Hey guys, look. Pretty girls! The one at the back... she looks fucking cool. - Hey, where are you going? - The middle one... no, the front one! - Hey girls! - Hello! What's all that about? Do you have a boyfriend? None of your business. Do we even know you? Just the three of you tonight? Do you have eyes? Of course it's just us. What kind of question is that?! You wanna go get something to eat? You might wanna look at your bike before you invite us out! Looks like it's on its last legs... - The wheels are about to fall off! - It's not gonna get very far! What matters is my loyal heart! The colours on your bike look ridiculous! Then take my heart. I'll give it to you for free! No way! Get a new bike before trying it on with any more girls. - I will. - And take a look at your faces! Hey, we're handsome! Call that handsome? That gives me goosebumps! You obviously haven't looked in the mirror. Best-looking guys in Phnom Penh, baby! - You look better with the mask on! - We are the best dancers in Cambodia! We wouldn't date you even if we were single. I can't stand the sight of you any longer... Shit, man... How could I follow them when they turned off so fast? Why are you riding like this? Let Ah Kha take over! - Shit. - Can you stick out your hand? - They were definitely interested! - Damn, we almost had them. You don't pay attention when you ride. It's your fault they left. How was I to know? Do you remember Ah Kha's cousin from Paris? He visited a couple of years ago. How would I remember? He has so many cousins abroad. Yeah, I wish I had some family abroad. Doesn't your cousin Tin work in Thailand? Doesn't he count? No, only if they live overseas. Your cousin's name is Tin, remember? How can we get home? Where can we fix our moto at this hour? What're you doing? You're a mess. I want more of this one. But who wants more of this country?! Tol, can I ask you a question? Are you in love with Kanha? You can ask me, but have you ever even kissed a girl? Don't try to change the subject! I asked first. You answer me first. Of course! Hey, this guy kisses his mum and then shows off to us. Don't try to show off! You're not getting out of this one! I'll slap you! I'll ask you once and be honest. Have you ever slept with Kanha? How can he reply if you ask straight like that?! No point dreaming about sex. She'd slap me just for a kiss! Cheers, anyway! Cheers, now that you've trashed the name of all good men everywhere! I won one more can! Me too! I got nothing. You should go get a blessing! Feels like it's gonna rain. What rain? There's only clear skies up there. So there's a big dance event next week. I heard lots of teams are going. Foreign ones too. We should go a bit earlier and watch them rehearse. I don't think I can make it. Remember I told you about my cousin from France? Yeah. I'll be with his family then. I'll just go with Tol then. You can come next time. No. My family is moving... To live with them in France. What about the competition? SPIRIT HOUSE Bring the bike over! Nang! Why did you call me up here at this hour? I saw Ah Kha again. I saw the three of us together. Still dancing together. But I couldn't tell where. What are you talking about? Have you spoken to Ah Kha lately? No. Where are we going? - Just go ahead! - Downstairs? - Yeah! - Let's go! - Wanna eat something? - Yeah. Watch out! I'm from the Ministry of Land Management. I'd like to give you this leaflet to read. Yes, thank you. Thank you everyone for coming here today. Yesterday I met with the Company. They've responded to our request to raise the buyout price. But... ...they're now offering $1,400 per square meter. Mum, how many square meters do we have? - 40. - How do you know? The staff from the Ministry came to measure everyone's apartment. When? Last month. Don't ask so many questions. Let's see what the others have to say. This is home to all of us. Please raise your hands if you have any comments. Chief! My apartment is only about 20 square meters. With that offer I wouldn't be able to move anywhere else in Phnom Penh. A small house in the neighbourhood costs half a million dollars these days. That's true! With that amount we can't even buy a house in the countryside! I think it's a reasonable price. What more do you want? Remember what happened at the lake! One day, they turned up with trucks and guns. Those people didn't get a penny. They've made us this offer. Why risk asking for more? Wait, listen to me! Those of you with bigger apartments, go ahead and take it. But I'm not gonna tear my home apart. I'm not moving my ass out of here! This place is about to collapse anyway! Be quiet, please. If everyone speaks at the same time how can we hear each other? Now, what I want is to hear a single joint counter-offer from you all before we go back and negotiate. Hello brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts. Everyone. My apartment is small but I can easily get to anywhere in the city from here. My proposal is to redevelop and rebuild our homes here instead of taking the money to go and live somewhere else. What do you all think? Sokhoeun, listen. Most people here intend to take the money. We already discussed a proposal to renovate and we decided against it. This meeting is just so we can discuss the compensation we want to ask for. We can't keep changing our demands all the time. Whoever agrees to this offer can leave now. But for those of us who refuse, we're staying here. This price of $1,400, I'm taking it! Wait a second! Chief, let me go! I'm not staying here any longer. Let's start practising again. I thought we'd already given up on it. Come on, just do it for fun. Don't you want to do it any more? Are you still dreaming? What's your husband's problem? He has a fever and often feels dizzy. Any other symptoms? He's been feeling unwell since yesterday. Can you please give me some paracetamol? Don't you want him to get checked? It could be something else. I want him to take the pills first then we'll see. Okay, one moment. I'll get them for you. Here you go. - How much? - $1.25. - Here is the change. - Yes. Give this to your father and follow the prescription. I'm going to the market now. Today, I want to speak to you about the history of Phnom Penh. To all friends and people of the Khmer nation I believe that everyone, all friends of the Khmer nation, are surely aware of the history of the city of Phnom Penh or have seen relevant videos on YouTube or on Facebook and other websites. However, today, I want to show you this film in order to share knowledge of the city's history... Some people have started a petition to reject the offer. They're just outside. You should go. Nang, what's your sister been up to lately? Tell her to get all her stuff out of here. If we take this price, we'll have to move out of town. It'll be tough to get to the kids' school or to work. If we sell here, where else can we buy? The offer is too low! The price is unacceptable! - Oh, the Chief's here. - Take a look, Chief! Does anyone know when they put that up there? They put it up this morning. Samphors! Mum's looking for you. Looking for me? Why? She wants you to take your last boxes away. Tell her I'll come and get them when I've got some time. They're like that all the time. There's always something. Is that why you moved out? I'm not a child anymore. What about Dad? Did he say anything? Not much. But he's got a problem with his foot and can't walk properly. What kind of problem? He just said he got a blister from his shoes. But I think it looks worse than that. Did you take him to a doctor? Nang, he has diabetes. You have to be careful. Don't take it too lightly. Mum got him some pills this morning. She said he just needed to rest and take the pills. From the pharmacy downstairs? Yeah. Why don't you take him to a proper doctor? - Like where? I don't have any money. - Did you ask if they had money? You don't know whether they have money or not? How much longer 'til you finish with this? Why? Mum's looking for you. Does your foot hurt? A little bit. Do you still have a high temperature? I've got these. What happens if the pills and tamarind treatment don't work? Let's see first. Dad... it's almost black. We should see a proper doctor. I have a meeting next week. What meeting? It'll get worse if you leave it too long. Let's see after the meeting. Dad... Some local officials are visiting the building with the Company. Do you think diabetics heal in a day? I really don't understand. You still have a week until your meeting. Look at your foot right now. Nang, you know my responsibilities, right? Nang! Let's go. Not many people out tonight. Hey, why are you so quiet? Oh, I know the taste of love When I've fallen so deeply I've fully surrendered my heart. I'll give up everything Just to have you beside me. You are the pillow of my heart. Oh, I know the taste of love When I've fallen so deeply. You hold me so closely I'll never let you go. Veasna! - Who's this? - Samnang. My friend isn't much of a drinker so maybe a Long Island for him. What's a 'Long Island'? It's just a light cocktail. You'll like it! And a gin and tonic for you? And you? We'll share. Great. Can I take the menus? Nang, have you made any arrangements yet? What arrangements? My grandma bought more boxes and plastic bags today. What for? She saw some neighbors have already started packing, so she did the same. I told her not to pack now since no one has accepted the offer yet. But she won't listen. My dad just says this has happened before. Let's see what happens when he meets them next week. But then if we don't move out I'll go crazy unpacking everything for her! Rub her leg gently! What's wrong with Smey? She was fine just a moment ago. She fell in the bathroom! - I was watching TV with her just before. - Mum, wake up! She hasn't had enough rest lately. Maybe that's why. Rub her chest and put some pressure on it to wake her up. Do you have any herbal medicine? Get her some water. So you came all the way here, but you're not going to fix anything? They just came to put up more notices! Why don't you fix the water supply? There must be a leak somewhere. Can't you check? Don't you get it? We haven't had water for five days! Five days! I've had to buy bottled water to cook noodles! What can I do? My supervisor just told us to put up the notices. How are you? I'm fine. What happened to your foot, Chief? Oh, it's no big deal. I'm fine. Well, please let me know if you need any help. Thank you. I'm sorry about the recent cut to the water supply. We're having a meeting to come up with a solution. But there are some who disagree. They say we should leave it as it is. But why? I heard them say they want the city to develop more quickly. To help the people find better places to live. Yes, I understand that. But we haven't agreed on the price yet. But how do the residents feel about the offer? Well, it could still be difficult for us to move out at that price. We've grown used to living in the centre of the city. I think the people in this building should feel fortunate. It's never happened before. Yes, I understand. But we should be able to reach a better agreement. Most of the residents used to be artists or officials. We all worked for the government. Of course we all know that. All the more reason why they should have somewhere better to live. They deserve better than this old building. What's the matter? Nothing. Is it too hot in your room? No. But I've been having nightmares almost every night lately. Just now, I saw you wearing a nice suit. You were walking alone. Nang, don't say another word! You shouldn't speak about things like that. I'm just talking to him. What's the big deal? It's not good to describe a nightmare out loud. Says who? If I never spoke up, would Dad know how I feel? We've always lived together yet I'm still not allowed to speak? Don't behave like your sister. Out, out! All bad luck, out. Dad, is something bothering you? I don't know what I'm doing. Let's go and see the doctor tomorrow. Look at your leg. I'd stay here if I could. I don't understand. If you wanted to stay, why didn't you say so at the meeting? How could I? I don't have the right to decide other people's lives. I have something to tell you. I met with the authorities last week. I told them we can't move anywhere unless they offer us a more reasonable price. But they haven't given any clear response yet. If we all stand together we can still fight for better compensation. Moving is never easy. I had to move once before. It was tough. So I've decided to stay here unless we get a better offer. AGREED: $1,400/SQUARE METER How can we accept so little? Am I wrong? I won't take it! Will you? I just won't take it. Let's refuse it, all of us together. Do you remember when you were little? You used to take it and play in front of our home. You wouldn't let anyone else touch it. This kind of wood is hard to find nowadays. What do you do? I'm already retired, Doctor. I was a sculptor. I also used to work for the Ministry of Culture. Where are you from originally? Phnom Penh? I'm from Pursat Province. But I moved to Phnom Penh in 1980. So how long have you had diabetes? Maybe 20 years. What time is it? Almost 11:00. I have to inform you that your toe is already seriously infected. The toe itself has already died. So it needs to be amputated now. If you leave it any longer, the infection will spread from your toe up to your knee. It could even go as far as your kidneys. At that point, we'd have to amputate your whole leg. Excuse me, Doctor, can we have a few days to think about it? Of course. Please take the time you need. But remember, it's better to have it cut off soon. The infection can spread very fast. Doctor, where would we get the surgery done? My clinic isn't equipped to do the operation. But I have a friend who's a surgeon. His place is fully equipped. I'll give you his address so you can contact him. - Thank you, Doctor. - Don't mention it. I received a call. They've dismissed you as Chief. Nang, get me the scissors. And can you boil some water? Dad. Why do you need scissors? I can't find them. Have another look. What do you want the scissors for? I'm going to cut the bandages off. What for? The doctor said to be careful. Didn't you get it? The doctor said he can't do it himself. He wants to send us to his friend's clinic. They just want our money. Just bring me the scissors. I'll show you. I'm going to ask you one last time. The doctor made it clear that the wound needs to stay covered. If you don't trust this doctor we can find a better one. If the next doctor also says you need to have your toe cut off, then you'll have to think about it seriously. It's up to you whether to have it cut off or not. Let me try doing this my own way. If this doesn't work... ...I'll try honey. Honey? You really think honey can heal your black toe? I'm sure it will. Let's wait a few weeks, then we'll see. - Do you want some water? - Yeah, just a little. MONSOON Move it over there. Here? You go first, Uncle. Lower it a bit. That'll do. Auntie, I'm leaving now. Alright, see you! You should just stay here for a while. - We don't know yet, but let's see. - Don't think so much. You have your sister's place here anyway. Wait until later this month. I'll take you to visit my friend's farm. She grows so many different things there. I just came back from there last night. What does she grow? So many things - banana, papaya, jackfruit and lots of green vegetables. And it's so chilly up there in the mountains! I'm not so good with the cold. What's that video? It's our apartment, Dad. I shot it when they started the demolition. I don't want to see it. Who's that? Have you asked Mum yet? I don't dare ask her. So no one knows yet, not even Dad? It's fine. Let's go. You should tell her. I've got the flat arranged for you already. Maybe you can tell her first. I'm afraid to tell her. But don't they even know a bit? No. Where's Mum? Mum? I thought, coming here, we'd all live together. I never thought you'd all leave, one by one. Who said we're leaving you? Your sister only comes here once a week. Now you want to leave me and move back to the city. I understand, Mum. But I'll visit you every weekend. When we've saved up enough, we'll all be in Phnom Penh, together again.
