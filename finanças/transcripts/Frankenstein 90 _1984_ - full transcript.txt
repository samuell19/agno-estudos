ENTRY PROHIBITED TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL HUMAN BIOLOGY CENTER Shit, no. Shit. Drop it! Drop it, bastard! Drop it! Dirty mutt. Bastard! Filthy dog! Where are you at? It's progressing. Don't worry! I'm not worried. I'm bored. You are exasperatingly slow. I need my freedom. I'm in a hurry too. Finally, my ancestors' dream will come true. Yes, but hurry. Just a small detail's missing. Hurry up! Hurry up! Please, don't get carried away! No! No! No! A small detail's missing. Only a small detail. A small detail, Mr. Victor. No! A small detail, detail… Ah, it's you, honey! Calm down! I'll be there. It was my best piece. Yes, I know, my love! A perfect arm! Muscular! Brawny! -What a pity! -At least, it wasn't the head! Are you kidding me? We don't have the right to make heads! This is the fifth time, Inspector. The first time was a leg, then an arm, then a body, and another leg, and now I think I'm going insane. You don't have a precise description of your attacker? He looked average! That's all! A little like him? Just as in industrial physics, we apply molecular attraction to two machined parts or microns like these researchers around the world apply the cellular laws of attraction to living tissues. Experiments on rabbits and cats by Professor… "Stratford de Maxwell"… Maxwell de Stratford on tissue osmosis have been successful without allergic reactions and with spectacular healing at the cutaneous and subcutaneous level. Any questions? Have you carried out such experiments? Oh well. I have-- not. Not at all. Not at all. If you'd like we can meet in ten days, gentlemen and ladies to dee… to… to deepen our understanding. Bye! I greatly admire your work, Professor. That's why I sought permission to sit with your students. It's astonishing that a shrewd man like you would use such crude methods. What do you mean? I do know a few things, you know. What do you know? Mr. Lafaurie, leave it to the professionals. Everyone has specific strengths. I can help you with what you need. I don't need anything. Obviously, it will be expensive. Let's say… Road accident, no parents, no police record, single. The head was removed by my friend, a licensed doctor. Here you go! A little damaged, this way no one will recognize him! No problem. Let's complete the deal! If you need anything else, count on me! Honey! You're soaked. What's all that? You don't remember? You don't remember, on March 18th, we complete two years. Oh, yes. Good. I had a conference with the Japanese. Lots of mix-ups, you know. Come closer. I'm a little tired. I've had enough of it! I know about your late nights. Fucking liar! Your Japanese? Is that a Japanese woman? Sayonara, my pal! I had to remove a part of your memory. You'll forget that you're a microprocessor. See you soon, Frank! Thanks! It's funny. It seems like I've met you before somewhere. -Ah, Corona! Good morning! -Good morning! -Good morning, Frank! -Good morning, Victor! How are you feeling? I'm very hungry. Well… Congratulations! In fact, we do say "I'm very hungry" and not "I have hunger". I'm so proud of you… to see you as a good grammarian. Do you know what to do? Spaghetti Bolognese! You did well on language, but not on manners! Do you see a fork? -This? -No! This one. You stick it in the food and put it in your mouth. Without throwing it aside. Come on, try it. I can't do this! Please excuse me. Well. Let's see how you walk. Careful! That's good! You've progressed. I counted five steps. Hello! Yes? Oh, it's you? No, this evening? I can't. Neither tomorrow. I'm very busy right now. Honey, Thursday? Yes. If you say so, Thursday. Of course I love you! I love you! I love you. What does "I love you" mean? We never cut the fish with a meat knife. In case, special cutlery is not available, we use the fork and a piece of bread. Similarly, the salad is never to be cut. The asparagus is eaten with fingers. Frank, pay attention! Be careful! I'd really like to meet my head. Slow down. There's a stop sign, and take the right. Perhaps I'm the only one who has never seen it. How does it look? Uh, not a bad one! Not bad at all. What kind? The kind you won't complain about! Your right, I said. Your right, your right! My dear Victor… right, left, huh… it's yes or no, isn't it? It is all a matter of convention. Being and not being, South and North, white and black, beginning and ending. Microcosm and macrocosm the mi… micro… microscom, the microscape, the macroscapescom… Relax, that's enough. It's hard, you know? I can only question myself. Who am I? Where am I from? Didn't I tell you? You lost your memory in an accident. You suffer from amnesia. I suffer from amnesia. What does this sign mean? "No overtaking." When will you remove these? Soon. Your scars… Watch out! Use your eyes, moron! Let's talk later. Eyes on the road! You'd have splattered the poor guy! It's maddening! I want to see myself! You should pay attention, asshole! I'm terribly sorry, sir. Looking at your face, I'm sure this is not your first accident! A brand new car! Sir, if you kept on with this, you'll regret it. Really? You'll see! Your car! A red light is for stopping, asshole! Let me go! Let me go! TWO TIERCÉS FOR 20 FRANCS Do you want me to fix you? Stop! Don't drop it! Frank, come back! That man is crazy! My car! He needs to be locked up! I don't tolerate rudeness. What will I drive now? My poor new car! My car! My car! This is not a good idea. Let's do it! Amazing! The scars will soon fade away. Are you sure? Is it okay? Really? I want to see my face! Why isn't there a mirror here? Let's find one! Isn't it a bit early? No, immediately! Are you confident? Yes, and I want to see. How horrible! Is that me? Are you sure this is me? Temporarily! You'll be perfect. Oh, shut up! You look better than the movie actor Belmondo. Who is he? I wish all his success for you! By the way… Yes? What matters is your soul. With this face, what soul will that be? Victor! I had forgotten about her completely! Coming! My gazelle! My gazelle! You're laughing? What's that? It's nothing, must be the pipes! Music? It inspires me! My gazelle! Someone's out there! Honey, someone's there! So? You're dreaming, it must be a… a big tomcat. You… I'll have to scold you. What's with the makeup and the mess? Should I powder more? Do I look better this way? Of course you do! But your gender seems off! And… Men don't wear makeup, Frank. In theory. I'll explain. Aren't you hungry? I'm not very hungry. Why have you locked me up here? Be patience, please. Tell me… What were you doing last night? Is that what's called "love"? Ah… yes. It's a tangible manner of showing love. See you tonight. Don't take too long. We'll go for a short walk. And the TV that you promised me. About Happiness. "Greatness of the soul is in letting the incidents fall into oblivion." Gazelle! Gazelle! My gazelle. For God's sake! For God's sake! Get out! Beautiful… Beautiful… Beautiful… She must be sick. What happened? Nothing. I gave her a little hug. Like you with Elizabeth. It's nice you thought about the TV. Come on! Lower! Come on! Let's do it! Follow me! Come on! It's fine. You can get down. Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. Hope you're okay. Without me, you wouldn't be here. What do you mean? I'll explain. Get down. By the way, you are not a man. How so? Ask your friend, Lafaurie. He's the expert. This could have been handled better. Did you take a look in the mirror? Hands off! Don't forget, you both are at my mercy. You should have a look in the cemetery. Hurry, let's go meet your… Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein, in fact… Lafaurie. Identity theft, robbery, corpse desecration, and to top it all a criminal act. Easily a life sentence. Unless, he coughs up as much as possible. Not joining me, heartthrob? Oh, shit! What would Victor say about this? Victor. It took the bait. It's huge! Cut some slack. Come on! Do something! Get the net. You're going to blow it! Let it go, damn it! See, that's it. Now, bring it on! Good! I'm happy. You should be, it's a monster. My ancestors' dream has come true! You wouldn't understand. Come on, cut some slack! Tell me. Your name is really Lafaurie? Well, yes. Reel it in a little more. Reel it in! Come on! Give it to me. No, it's mine. Oh, Sweet Lord! So we're at it again! We're at it again, for God's sake! Frank! FRANKENSTEIN CASTLE SWITZERLAND PASSPORT FRANKENSTEIN, VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN, VICTOR BORN IN LUCERNE ON JULY 18, 1859 Well, I'm really… Well, this is my cousin from Zurich. Hello! It skipped my mind. He'll stay a few days. -That so? -Yes. He was in a car accident. Come on in. Victor, you surprise me! We never cut a fish with a meat knife. Give it to me. I'll show you how it's done. When we don't have special cutlery, use a fork and slide it over with a piece of bread. Our family takes pride in etiquette. -Eat it while it's still hot. -Thank you. So, a fork… and a tiny bit of bread. That's good, Victor! You're from Zurich? Yes. Where do you live? Yes, yes. The small tavern near the sea, what's it called? Yes, yes. You know, my love, my cousin… has forgotten German. He's from Zurich, but he studied in Geneva. What did you study? Cosmetic industry. Pass me the sheet, please. Do you like it? Yes. Honey, he lost his memory in the car accident. That's right. I suffer from… amnesia. Hush, don't be scared! Don't be scared. I won't hurt you! I won't hurt you! Don't be scared! I won't hurt you! I won't hurt you! I won't hurt you! Don't be scared! I won't hurt you! Calm down! A little hug! Just a hug! What's wrong, Elizabeth? Answer me! Elizabeth! I didn't do anything! Just a little hug. You will pay for this! Elizabeth! You've given me immense pain! I beg you! -Listen to me! -You, bastard! Please let me explain! Listen to me! I beg you, please listen to me! You've given me immense pain! Immense pain! Immense! Do you think I'll believe this? You've always lied to me! All my life, it has been this way. Not being able to confide in someone you love, you don't know what that's like! I almost pity you! -Yes! -Come up with something else! There's a family curse I can't escape. They were trying to recreate life. They could only create monsters. I couldn't help it. I had to give it my all. Of course. Let's assume that I believe you, how did you do it? Well… For the transplants? Thanks to my biological accelerator. It amplifies the cellular attraction, after that it's child's play. You are an asshole, but a talented one. In the end, I'm Frankenstein's bride! I assure you, you have nothing to fear. He won't hurt you anymore. Where did he go now? Frank! Frank! Please, Frank! Stop! Come back, Frank. Stop! Please! Ah, my child! Come here. -I don't deserve to live! -Come to me! Come back, Frank! You shouldn't have created me. You shouldn't have! Miss… Forgive me, but I really need some affection. I told you, it was a dumb movie! Mary Shelley wrote nonsense. That takes the cake! Sh! Oh shit! Thankfully, I don't have that face! This is not a coffee shop! Shut the f… Look what I baked for you! Superb! You're an angel, darling! Sit down! Should I get champagne? Good idea! What a crappy movie it was! And the actor! What's-his-name? Boris Karloff. He was amazing. Excuse me, honey. Here's to your first drink! Take it easy, you're not used to it! It stings. But it's good. The look on Karloff's eyes… says everything that needs to be said. I'm getting another one. Okay, but it will be the last. People hated him. What he wanted was just a little love. Poor guy! He was really lonely. But with a face like that, what else do you expect? You do not know how lucky you really are. You didn't eat my cake, Frank? Of course. You're in luck, Victor. Elizabeth. She is beautiful. She is wonderful. And pure. She is a keeper. A stress… stressure… A treasure. Yes, yes… come now… There, there. Couldn't you have made him a little lighter? He's not doing well right now. I told you, we don't have a choice. We cannot take this risk. This time, honey, I'll be with you. Did you see the legs of the one to your right? I like the one on the left. And the boobs on the girl in the center! That ass! Elizabeth, doesn't she look like a dream? What I like is… a girl who's not so tall, someone sweet, romantic… graceful… a brunette, with hazel eyes and tilts her head a certain way. I'd like one like that. You have no clue! The ideal one would have the Bonbon de Nemours' head, Rita Ketchup's boobs, the ass, oh God, the ass of Lola Super Jet. You sure do know more than I do. We will never find a girl that perfect. With my network in the morgue, we will find one. Victor! Elizabeth! Come over, I have a surprise! Come on, I have a surprise. Look! So we're at it again! We're at it again! We're at it again! But aren't these three you wanted? I didn't get the wrong ones, did I? We're at it again! Elizabeth, you saw when he said it. I'm going to call the police! Stop! Frank! I'm calling the police! This cannot go on. The head was difficult. I resolved it with a microprocessor. Something went wrong. I have created a monster. Yeah, right. By any chance, are you Dr. Frankenstein? How did you guess? I love movies. Do you know what it costs to be in contempt of court? The corpse seems to have disappeared. Yes, of course! I'm sure that Bonbon and her friends are still in the freezer. Let's go, sir! That's enough, Mr. Lafaurie! You need treatment. Come on, Victor! Come on! I assure you it's not true! He has a good heart. Don't forget, he is your baby! He'll have to learn the right and the wrong. All these are tiny mistakes. If you say so! Relax, Victor. Tiny mistakes? He feels lonely. Adelaide will fix things. I am Adelaide. I'm twenty-five. I was born in Colmar. I don't have a family. I feel good about myself. I always say "yes" to the man who loves me. I think we are done. Come to see her. I was born in Colmar. I don't have a family. She looks much better than your pig face. In the end, it's a blessing in disguise. She's gorgeous. You're taking it well. Why not? With two or three imperfect ones, we created a perfect one. I feel good about myself. I always say "yes" to the man who loves me. I am Adelaide. Are you done? Leave us alone now. You can come in now, Frank. Here you are! My love! I'm so happy. He's not the one. It's the other one. My love! I'm so happy! What happ-- Help me, Frank! Slowly. Slowly. Come. Leave her alone. She needs to rest. Honey, you slice it at a right angle. Not in the direction of the fiber. I do what I can, by the way, it's the job of the head of the household. Here, help yourselves. Is it normal that she's been asleep for so long? Don't worry. This is good! It needs a little garlic. This man is never happy. It's been almost 24 hours. Good morning! Good morning! Good morning, my love! It smells good. I'm ravenous! Adelaide. You're naked. Do you not find me beautiful? He was there, lurking in the shadow, like a predator. A dog was howling in the street. Suddenly, he was in front of me with an evil laugh. Oh, that face! The demon's mask! A horrible, atrocious scar on his face! The snickering mouth! His eyes! Oh my God! His eyes! Oh, his eyes! Was he a man? A machine? Well, Frankenstein! The asshole! He drove away peacefully, and poof, he left. Albert ran after him. Isn't it, Albert? Yes, yes! I managed to get on the step. What a head he had! A real monster! Stitches all over, disgusting! He punched my face and I fell on my ass like an idiot. If I catch him, I'll break him into pieces. I'm a little scared. Don't worry. However, when I look at Frank, I understand… Frank was a draft. Don't move now. Mirror! You are very beautiful, Adelaide! I will always say "yes" to the man who loves me. Frank is lucky! Two more here and here. Two over there! You and you. Catch him! I said catch him! For God's sake, catch him! Quick! Officer! Stop this! It's my fault. Leave us alone now. -You better appear in court tomorrow. -But Officer! Frank! Frank! HOME APPLIANCES Sorry, ma'am. I need your bag. Thank you very much, ma'am. Thank you. He was seen in Saint-Germain forest. But the police operation couldn't find anything. According to the investigators, the monster is not far. It is currently located in the suburbs where the search continues. The emotion is immense in the world. Thus the myth of Frankenstein created by Mary Shelley was not a fable. Yes? I don't want to be a bother to anyone. Especially to you. No, no. No, I'm thinking about your stress, Elizabeth. I'm leaving. Goodbye. Frank! Hello! Hello! I don't want to be a bother to anyone. Especially for you. No, no. No, I'm thinking about your stress, Elizabeth. I'm leaving. Goodbye. Frank! SECOND FRANK You have abandoned your creator, Frank. Where are you? I'm a disembodied brain. So, I don't have the same reactions as my double. But I will try to help you. What are the elements of his life that I don't have in my memory? You have a face you don't like. You are very sentimental. You refuse to be a creature without past. You're in search of your identity. You don't know the good from the bad. And you suffer because of it. With this information, either I will destroy myself or I'll return to what I think is my birthplace. Quick, let's go! Where to? I think I know where Frank is. If he's still alive. Miss! Miss! Miss! Let's go! FRANKENSTEIN CASTLE - ONE MILE I'm very hungry. Frank! You go this way, and you, that way. Frank! Honey! Honey! You don't seem too happy to see me! Of course I do! Is that all you have to say to me? You love someone else. Don't talk nonsense. Then, kiss me. There! That's all? Leave me alone! Alone! You think you can talk to me like that? You dirty faggot! -Faggot, faggot… -Alone, alone… Frank! What a woman! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Disgusting bastard! -Bastard! -Listen, relax. -Bastard! -Relax. -My baby! -Bastard! My little one! What an animal, that woman! It's nothing, Elizabeth. Well, anyway. At least, you are nice. You understand women. You smell great. You are soft. But it seems to me, Adelaide, that… all this is at least… You shut up. …too hasty? Shut up. I like you. Let's fuck. Adelaide, it seems to me… Adelaide! I wish this could last forever. We'd be so good together. If only I didn't have this face! I think you have a great personality. You're not like everyone else. Their mediocre life, their lousy job, their little dreams, is that what you want? By the way… Yes? Your face can be fixed. You are really a sweet person, Elizabeth. Surrender now! You're surrounded! Surrender now! You're surrounded! It's too dangerous. You should stay back. No, Frank! Stay here. Don't be scared. Frank! You are not going to sleep? No. I'll stay with him. A FEW MONTHS LATER… It is the world's unique invention. It is estimated that you will have 50% of the profit for this exclusive contract. Fifty percent? What do you think? It's impossible. We all agree? -For an exclusive contract? -No. -It's 50% or nothing. -No. If you won't agree, we'll have to go with another company. Never mind. Goodbye! Thanks for your visit. Thank you! Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Thank you! Goodbye! No, it is impossible, Mr. Schmidt. I cannot accept this price. Goodbye! Yes, darling! You're handsome! Very handsome! I have to get used to it, you know? Darling. Your fingers! Your magic fingers! Your fingers created a miracle! What happened to him? Look at you! All of this is your fault. The third head has exploded. You want it all in a hurry. I messed up. This idiot almost broke the computer. The clients are impatient. Tokyo Fair is on September 14th. They'll wait. These two freaks will ruin Frankenstein's reputation. Adelaide, unplug this one for me. It's annoying. Linen, dishes, coffee, silverware, crystals, walk the kids, drive the car, walk the dog, shine the shoes… You have to get all this into their heads. I can't do it. Of course you can. Yes. English is good, Japanese is perfect. But my German is terrible. You need to change my memory. -Okay? -Well… Adelaide, the clamp. Oh, what's the occasion? Can't you guess? What? You too? What do you mean? My dear, that's amazing! That's amazing! Please, don't get carried away! Look at these assholes, flirting again! At the least, they can have children. We will also. You'll see. I think I've found a way. The future is ours.
