There's a story told in the town of Big Lake, Texas, a story of the town's beginnings. It's the story of the Santa Rita No.1, the birthplace of west Texas oil. Now, as with most Texas legends, there was a man who thought oil was right beneath his feet. And, as with most such stories, no one else believed him. Except, in this case, for two nuns who, in 1923, met the man and believed so much in him and his dream, that they invested money no one knew they had. When the nuns told their parish priest about the man's dream and their investment in it, he counseled them to try and get their money back. Sheepishly, they admitted it was too late, that the money was already spent. Well, the priest, he sighed, shook his head, and offered just one small bit of advice. To bless the site with rose petals, and invoke the help of St. Rita, patron saint of impossible dreams. And while the workers waited for the oil that would eventually come, they played baseball. Played baseball so well that some were able to give up the dirt and despair and went on to play major-league ball in the glory days of Ruth and Gehrig. Come on! I've heard and told that story on many occasions, but that was long before St. Rita decided to bless our little town just one more time. First game in the big leagues. And Jimmy Morris has a no-hitter going. Jimmy, don't throw it so hard. My hands are cold. - What are you doing? - Waitin' till spring, that's what I'm doin'. Your father and I need to talk to you. I hear Virginia's real nice. At least, that's what the navy folks told your father. - Isn't that right, Jim? - We'll just be moving again. It's my job to decide when we move. It's your job to make the best of it. (mother) Jim, please. Who knows? Maybe it won't snow so much in Virginia. Jimmy Morris. Another masterful pitching performance. Well on his way... to another World Series title. Your father and I need to talk to you. Strike three! Hey. - Hey, partner, how you doin'? - Hey. - Hey, Dad. - Jimmy. Hm? I had a good game. 13 strikeouts. Did you win? I just found out. There's a chance we may be restationed again. - How much of a chance? - It's in west Texas. The navy wants me to be a recruiter there. Texas? When? Three weeks. But, Dad... - We still got half our season to play. - I'm aware of that. - Maybe I could stay with the Johnsons... - Uh-uh. We move as a family. I don't have a choice in this. - What kind of baseball do they have? - They don't. I hear they might be starting some summer ball. Yes, sir. - (brother) What are those things? - (Jimmy) What? Those things moving up and down. Oil rigs. When those things are movin' up and down, means times are good. Looks like times are good. Shoot. We must've left some of 'em back in Florida. Left what? I packed a couple of boxes with socks and things. I could've sworn... Jimmy, did you find that one box...? - Oh, no. - It's OK, Mom. Don't worry, honey. We'll find it. I've never known a boy get so upset about losing his socks. - His glove was in there. - His what? His glove was in there. Oh, quit mopin' and grab a box. Did you hear me? There are more important things in life than baseball. The sooner you figure that out, the better. (low conversation) (man) I guarantee you, within two years, three years tops, he's gonna run that company right outta business. Ain't that right, young man? Eileen? Eileen! I guess she's gone to lunch. Help you find something, son? - Socks. - Socks, we have. In contrast to common sense, which we seem to be running a little short on today. I'll be right down. Don't look at my dominoes. All right, sir, we got white socks with red stripes, black stripes, blue stripes. Over there you got all your solids: black, blue, brown and gray - just take your pick. That's a real nice pair, right there. - You visiting? - We just moved here. - Oh, well, then, I'm Henry Sampson. - Nice to meet you. Jimmy Morris. Welcome to Big Lake, Mr. Jimmy Morris. Son, I can probably tell you where it is a whole lot quicker than you can find it. - Got any baseball stuff? - Oh, baseball stuff. Don't get much call for baseball stuff around these parts. Now, if it was football, that'd be a whole different story. You know, I got a catalog over here that just might help us out some. Let's take a look at that. Yeah, I think we might find somethin' in here. You know, if you're interested in baseball, there's a story that people here in this town tell that you probably oughta hear. I thought you said nobody here cared about baseball. They care about this. It all started with a couple of nuns, and a piece of ground not too far from here... - Morning, Esther. - Morning, Jimmy. Any more rattlesnakes on the playground? Yeah, two this morning. I swear those things show up every time the oil business goes bad. - They gonna bring the kids in? - They're thinkin' about it. Don't these families have enough to worry about? - Coach. - Counselor. - Don't report that, Esther. - I never do. Sum means that we're adding. We have at least two items. Don't make this hard. What are we adding here? Protons and...? - Neutrons? - Neutrons! Neutrons. So, David... These protons and these neutrons. They're inside of... what? The nucleus? Don't say it like a question, son. If you think you know it, just say it like you know it. - The nucleus! - That's right, the noo-cleus. So congratulations. Go home tonight and tell your parents you figured out the mass number of an atom. ( "The Christmas Song" by Nat King Cole) Frank, isn't it a little late to be playing this song? - It's 8.30. - It's March. This song's too good to play for only one month. - Hunter, you gonna want cheese on that? - Yes, sir. - Besides, he smoked three packs a day. - Who? Nat King Cole. He thought it'd make his voice deeper. And Frank Sinatra was a poster child for vocal care? Who died in his forties? You take care of yourself, things work out. Oh, is that right, is it? Well, what about Jimmy there? I mean, he took real good care of himself, and how many surgeries was it? Four? They put this thing from his ankle up to his shoulder. We're talkin' about singin', not pitchin'. And, Hunter, do us all a favor and don't tell us that bit about the ankle any more. - Mel Tormé in June. - What are you talkin' about now? Mel Tormé wrote "The Christmas Song" on a beach somewhere. There weren't no Jack Frost nippin' at anybody's nose that day. - Daddy? - Yeah? Your arm ever hurt any more? Only when I have to drag you out of bed in the morning for school. I'm just kiddin' you, bud. It hasn't hurt in a long time. How long? - Why you wanna know? - Just wonderin'. Well, let's see. It never hurt when I was in high school 'cause we didn't have a baseball team. And it never hurt when I was in junior college 'cause... well, that's why I got drafted. And then, uh... I don't know, it just started hurtin'. Is that why you didn't make it? It's never one thing. (baby crying) (Jimmy groans) I'll get her. Is that a real "I'll get her", or are you just waiting for me to say "Go back to sleep"? I haven't decided yet. Go back to sleep. What's all that cryin' about? - I think it's my turn. - No, it's your turn to sleep. OK. You're sure? Yeah. There we go. Come on, baby. There we are. - Good night. - Night. There we go. Shh. There we go. - All set, Coach. - Give me a ball. Hey, Coach, forgot my glove. Check the bag. - Ten players, nine gloves - Yeah. - (Jimmy) How do they look? - (catcher) Couple of holes. - (Jimmy) All right, get one! - Thanks, man. Hey, Coach! They puttin' down any grass seed in the field this year? Man, it's a goat track out here. - Just waitin' for the seed to take. - What seed? - Ain't no seed out here, man. - Wack! How come we get dirt and the football field looks like Tiger Woods' backyard? - They don't even play for six months. - Just let me worry about the field, all right? - You plan on worrying any time soon? - All right, Wack. You can get your runnin' done early today. All right, I'll get my runnin' in early. OK, bring it home! Hey, Coach. You wanna throw? I seen you out there at the old Legion Field at night. Sometimes it helps when you throw if you got somebody catchin' for ya. A ball, a glove, that kind of thing? - I'll throw a couple. - Really? All right! How come you throw out there, all by yourself? Helps me relax. Doin' it a pretty long time. Coach, back when you were really throwin', how fast were you bringin' it? I don't know. 85, 86? - That's not bad. - Well... It is when the other guy's throwin' 90. Coach, come on. Let's see you bring one. - Can't. Promised too many doctors. - Come on, Coach. One is not gonna kill you. - Come on! Feed me. - Yeah, Dad! Bring the heat! Feed me, Coach. - Wow! - Coach... Where'd that come from? Forgot how good that sounded. Yes! Unbelievable. Coach, how fast do you think those were comin'? Oh, not as fast as you think. Hey, do me a favor, all right? - Let's just keep this between you and me. - OK. - Could barely see that last one. - That goes for you too, all right? - No tellin' Mom. - Why? Because I said so. Good night, Ray. I know why your grass isn't growin'. Usually get three or four out here every night. I put the seed down, they pick it up. Once it comes in, they don't like it as much. That's why the football field looks so good. Yeah? Maybe those football guys are payin' off these deer with all their big-budget money. Hey! Go on! Get outta here! I thought deer are supposed to be skittish? (Lorri) You need me to top that off? Nothin' like wine bought with a Chevron credit card. Well, I know what a demanding consumer you can be. - Mm, yeah. - Yeah. I threw today. To Joel, after practice. - You threw? - I threw. How hard? Pretty hard. Oh, don't worry. If it starts to hurt, I'll stop. All right? Promise. I gotta check on the kids. Wack, got the muffler changed, buddy. The Jeep. Can't hear me coming three miles away, can you there? Ray, check out the screwball. Ladies lovin' the Jeep. Come on, man, gimme the rock! All right, bring it in for some BP. We can't. Rudy's not here. - Where is he? - Locker room. Something to do with only havin' one shoe. Somebody grab a bat. - You're throwin' batting practice? - Yeah. I'm up first, man! I hit the lotto! Come on, Wack! Send it, baby, send it! What do ya say, Wack? (laughter) Whoa! Looks like that one's gonna land in another time zone, Coach. You might wanna reset your watch before this next one. - You see that? - Yeah, it's... Come on. What was that? - Man! - Wait till he warms up. - Let me see another one of those. - Nope. It's batting practice, not pitching practice. All right. Oh, my God! I'm already down two bits. How many of them job applications you plannin' on sending out, Jimmy? As many as it takes, I guess. So the little boy who come into my store to buy socks after a dozen moves is plannin' on makin' a move of his own now? - Well, this is different. - It always is. I hear you diagnosed that problem with that baseball field of yours. - You mean his potential field. - Well, diagnosed part is right. - It's the curing part I'm having trouble with. - I'll take five. You know, I had the same trouble out at my place a few springs back. You did? What'd you do? Oh, hell, gimme five too. Lemme ask you something. How many games have you got on that field in the next couple of weeks? Well, we play there next Friday, but then we're not back till the end of the month. You think you can keep your boys off the field for that length of time? I'm talkin' about no practice, nothin' whatsoever? Henry, why do I get the feeling this is something I don't wanna know about? I'm gonna take back two of them old ones, if that's OK with everybody. I'll tell you what you do. You give me three weeks and I'll have that field lookin' greener than Dublin on St. Patty's Day. 50 cents, fellas. Rudy Bonilla, hoping to spark a Big Lake rally. Come on, Rudy. Be a hitter! Strike three! Strike three called and Owls drop their season opener. It's all right. It's OK. Good effort. It's only one. If we don't start hitting, it's not gonna be the only one. (announcer) Drive friendly on your way home now, folks. - Where do you keep your brooms, Cal? - Closet. Right here, sweetheart. (spectator) Get ready, Cory! Play's at second, Miguel! - Blue! - Time! And Owls are down... ten. - It's not your day, Rudy. - Not my year. Looks like coach Jimmy Morris is makin' a pitchin' change. (spectator) Shake it off, Rudy! (Cal) Just remind folks the concession stand is still open. Anybody wanna tell me how we lost that game? No? How about takin' a look at the numbers on that scoreboard out there? What do those numbers tell you? How to get ahold of Bo's Tire Barn? You quit. You quit out there. You quit on me and, worse, you quit on yourselves. Now, what is it? You think people don't care about baseball around here? You think the school's gonna drop the program? You're just makin' it easy for 'em. The sad part about it is I see it and you don't. Look, guys. Most of ya... you're gonna finish up school here, you're gonna work the rigs, you're gonna work at Bo's Tire Barn, you're gonna raise a family and retire, and you're gonna do all that right here in Big Lake. And there's nothing wrong with that. A lot of real good people have done that. I'm doin' it. But if you're lookin' for something more after you're done here, you'd better give some serious thought as to how you're gonna play out the rest of this season. What difference does it make? It's not like any of us are gettin' scholarships. I'm not talkin' about college. I'm talkin' about wanting things in life. I'm talkin' about havin' dreams. And all that starts right here. OK? Right here. You don't have dreams, you don't have anything. Coach, what about you? I mean, you talk about our dreams. I been catchin' yours... - We are not talkin' about me. - Yeah, but come on, Coach. Every time you throw, I gotta ice my hand, every time. You're the one who should be wantin' something more. And the sad part is, I mean... we see it and you don't. No, listen. I've had my shot, all right? Just... Look, we got practice tomorrow. Let's go. - So you take another shot... - It doesn't work like that. - It does if you throw hard enough. - I don't throw hard enough, all right? - Now let's hit the showers. - Wait a minute. We start winnin', you try out again. (sighs) Last time I checked, the scouts aren't lookin' for high-school science teachers. Well, not many science teachers throw like you. - No kiddin'. - Yeah. It'd take a heck of a lot more than a couple of wins to get me to make a fool of myself. What if we win District, huh? What if we win District and go to State playoffs. Then? - You serious? - Yeah, absolutely. - Are you serious? - Yes. Yeah. And all I have to do is just find some kind of tryout somewhere? That's it, man. - All right. - (all) Yeah! If you win District. Come on, man, we can do this! Yeah! I don't get to tell Mom about this, do I? ( "Stuff That Works" by Guy Clark) I got an ol' blue shirt And it suits me just fine I like the way it feels So I wear it all the time I got an ol' guitar, won't ever stay in tune I like the way it sounds in a dark and empty room I got an ol' pair of boots And they fit just right Hm. Well, I can work all day And I can dance all night I got an old used car, it runs just like a top. I get the feelin' it ain't ever gonna stop Stuff that works Stuff that holds up The kind of stuff you don't hang on the wall Stuff that's real Stuff you feel The kind of stuff you reach for when you fall Stuff that works Stuff that holds up The kind of stuff you don't hang on the wall Stuff that's real Stuff you feel The kind of stuff you reach for when you fall Stuff that works Stuff that holds up The kind of stuff you don't hang on the wall Stuff that's real Stuff you feel The kind of stuff you reach for when you fall (sighs) - You sure about this, Henry? - Yeah. Deer get a whiff of human hair, they just keep on movin' till they don't smell it no more. I figure we put us a circle all the way around the field here. That's a lotta hair. Well, from the look of things, contrary to popular opinion, Cal ain't been cheatin' nobody down there in his shop. It helps if you actually wear those goggles, Ms. Martinez. - Yeah, baby. - Is that what I think it is? That, gentlemen, is Bermuda Hybrid No.5. We're gonna have a baseball field. (doorbell) - Maybe he's not home. - He said he'd be here. - Hey, Grandpa. - Hunter. I was reading in the paper this morning that someone in your family is having a birthday. - That's a kid joke, Grandpa. - Kid joke? No kiddin'. - Jimmy. - Sir. Whoa! - It's kinda big. - You'll grow into it faster than you think. Look, Dad. It doesn't have any fingers. That's 'cause it's a first baseman's mitt. Uh... is that wrong? Well, you know, I probably got the receipt somewhere. We can just get another one, huh? - One with fingers. - That's OK, Grandpa. I like first base. Could I go outside and play, Dad? Yeah. What do you say first? Thank you, Grandpa. I really like it a lot. Oh! Stay in the yard. - If he decides he wants one with fingers... - I'll take care of it. I didn't know you had these. Oh, yeah. - Your mother gave me a few. - Hm. She'd be the one to have 'em. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Hunter Happy birthday to you - Jessica! - Don't worry, your wish still counts. Charles, do you think that that ice-cream machine is gonna start spinnin' itself? - Oh, I got to go get a knife. - I'll help you, Mom. I think we need plates, hon, too. Seems like five minutes ago I was watchin' you blow out those candles. - You tryin' to make me feel old? - Come talk to me in 20 years. Hunter says you spent some time at your father's today. Yeah. - You know where I'm goin' with that? - Yes, ma'am, I do. Lorri says he's tryin' real hard to be a good grandfather. Yeah, well... Jimmy, I swear the one thing you got from him is his stubborn side. - That's not true. - (sighs) Well, what do you want me to do? Pretend everything was perfect? You've been blaming your father for too many things for too many years. I just call 'em like I see 'em, Mom. Jimmy, you can sell that story someplace else, 'cause I ain't buyin'. You got your shot at baseball, and you got hurt. Simple as that. It had nothing to do with your father. You think he didn't have dreams? That why it didn't work out with you two? I'm gonna need a longer street for that talk. OK, let's get to. Come on, Wack! Come on, Coach, how long we gonna practice here? Just a couple more days. Playin' in a gravel yard. OK, Wack, come on in for batting practice. - Come on, let's go. - OK, OK. OK. Nice easy swings. Turn your hips. Throw your hands at the ball. Come on, Coach. If we're gonna start winning, we need to see some better pitching. - You gonna help us or not? - Come on, Coach, right here. (fielder) Yo, let's see some action! Come on, Wack! ( "Run On" by Elvis Presley) Well, you may run on for a long time Run on for a long time Run on for a long time Let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down Go tell that long-tongued liar Go tell that midnight rider Tell the gambler, rambler, backbiter Tell them God Almighty gonna cut 'em down You may throw your rock and hide your hand Working in the dark against your fellow man As sure as God made the day and the night What you do in the dark will be brought to the light You may run and hide, slip and slide Trying to take the mote from your neighbor's eyes As sure as God made the rich and poor You gonna reap just what you sow (fielder) Man! Yeah, right on, man! I got a piece of that one! Now... get all of it. (players) You the man, Wack! Catchin' up, Coach! (crowd cheers and applause) Go, Wack, go! Go, go, go, go, go! 'Attaway, Wack! Hustle! Run, boy, run! Out! - Take it, Joel! - Got it! (Rudy) Run, run, run! Yeah! Hit it, Wack! Eye on the ball, buddy!

(Cal) Owls win again, and that is five in a row! It's been a slow turning Let's go! From the inside out A slow turning, baby But you come about A slow learning... Whoo!

You're gonna die, gonna die for sure... Strike three! But there ain't no cure There's just a slow turning (Cal) Going, going... Gone! A slow turning Whoo-hoo! (Cal) The Owls clear the bases. (cheering) Yeah! Yeah! Taking it downtown! Yeah! (cheering) Hey, hey, hey! Keep it down now, folks. They're gonna think the football season's started already. (cheering) Now, a lot of coaches would say that they're really proud of you right now. - And I am. - (cheering) Other coaches, a lot of coaches, would say that it's amazing that we won this many games in a row, and it is. (cheering) But... but, but, but, but... I am not gonna say that I do not care about tomorrow's game. Because I do. So let's finish this thing up! (cheering) (all chant) State! State! State! State! State! State! State! - Quite a group you got there. - Thanks. I'm Steve Dearborn. I'm with the Barton School District in Fort Worth. I was hoping we might be able to talk about that application you sent us. Uh... sure. (inaudible) - They'll understand. - (sighs) I got most of 'em coming back. Jimmy, you're always gonna have kids coming back. - Not these kids. - It's Fort Worth. High-school coaching jobs don't get any better. You get to coach, you get to teach. Not that it's the most important thing in life, but... It's twice the money, Jimmy. We sure could use it. I know. Well... I'm done tellin' you to sleep on it, 'cause that sure ain't workin'. Three years ago, this program ended the season with only one win. Two years ago... one win. Last year... same story. This year... we have won 16 games. But, gentlemen... We need 17. Anybody got any questions? Hm? Coach... Comin' back next year? Wack, why don't we worry about this year first, all right? All right, gentlemen, hats off. Lord, we humbly thank you for bringin' us here this season without injury and inspiring us...

Keep your heads up, keep your heads up. Get this thing back to even. All right, Brandon, grab some wood. Joe David, you're on deck. This guy's fastball stinks, so be lookin' out for his curves, all right? All right, one hit at a time, one swing at a time, one run at a time. - Come on now. - Watch him! Let's go. Let's get a hit, baby! Let's get a hit! He's out! Damn. Owls still with that zero up on the board. Out! A scorcher that dang near took our boy's head off. (cheering) Slide, slide! Safe! And that puts Big Lake in scoring position. You all right? (Cal) Rudy Bonilla coming to the plate. - Safe! Safe! - Yeah! A suicide squeeze, and the Owls go on the scoreboard! Go, go, go! (cheering) A spectacular catch, and the Owls are hangin' in there. Come on, Wack! (Cal) Joe David is still on first base. I see it! I see fear in his eyes, Wack! (all shouting) - Come on, Wack!

No. - We need to go see the real estate guy. - (baby cries) He's been a captain forever. Why don't they make him something better? What, you mean like Admiral Crunchy? Just say "Yes, ma'am" so I know you heard me. - Yes, ma'am. - Take 'em all with you if you go. You kids mind your daddy. Remind me not to forget Jamie if we go anywhere. They got lots of players, Daddy. Sign here. Have your players get in line, Coach. Everybody signs in. Jim Morris. Dave Patterson. I saw you when the Brewers drafted you. - Must have been... - A while back. - How you doin', Dave? - Good. You, uh... still lookin' at players? Oh, well, the looking's the easy part. It's the finding that gives me trouble. You bring us some kids, besides you own? Um... I'm here for me. - For you? - Uh-huh. - Well, all right, then. - All right. - Good to see ya. - That's good.

Look, I promised to try out. There's nothin' I can do if they won't take a look at me. Jimmy! Come on, you're up! Just a second! - I'm not doin' it! - (sighs) All right, look. You just stay right here and you look after your sister, all right? Come on, let's go! (baby crying louder) Be right back. Who do we got here? All right, all right. - You need to warm up? - No. No, I'm good. Don't hurt yourself. Whenever you're ready. Yeah, whenever I'm ready. (exhales) ( "Blue Moon Nights" by John Fogerty) Help me fellas, I'm feelin' kinda weak The way I'm livin' just ain't right I need somebody to watch over me All my blue moon nights I want a girl to take me by the hand Follow me right down the line Hold me gently while we dance All my blue moon nights - You want me to keep goin'? - Couple more. Help me fellas, it's gettin' kinda late Runnin' out of precious time She might pass me while I waste All my blue moon nights Heaven only knows I don't wanna be Just a fool Passin' through Won't you send an angel to walk with me All my blue moon nights All my blue moon nights All my blue moon nights That's good, Jim. Pitch? Pitch? Man, you were bringin' some heat out there. - Oh, come on. - You had 'em talkin'. You had 'em talkin'. Good job, man. - (truck horn) - (Hunter) That was Jessica! Jim. How fast were you throwin' 15 years ago? Slow enough the scouts stopped usin' the word "fast". Yeah, but how fast were you throwin'? I don't know. 85, 86? - Why? - You just threw 98 miles an hour. - Nah. - Dozen straight pitches. Three radar guns. Same thing on all of 'em. No, Dave, there's no way that I was... I been a scout a long time, and rule no.1 is: arms slow down when they get older. Listen, Jim, I call the office and I say I got a guy here almost twice these kids' age, I'm gonna get laughed at. But if I don't call in a 98-mile-an-hour fastball, I'm gonna get fired. I'm just lettin' you know that there's a chance you might get a call on this. You figure out what I saw out there today, you let me know, OK? OK. (Jimmy) Hey, hon. Don't fix dinner, we're gettin' some pizza. - Oh, thank God. - (beep) Jim, this is Dan Jordan with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. I'll try you back later. (beep) Jim, Mark Rafus from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Dave Patterson told me about this afternoon. - I'll try you first thing in the morning. - (beep) Hey, Jim, this is Dave. We're gonna have you throw again in a couple of days, just to make sure. They're gonna send out some of the boys from Tampa. Mommy! Daddy told me to give you the pizza and not tell you anything else. Thank you, sweet pea. I'm sure that's exactly what he told you. - (giggles) - All right, all right, go ahead. (Hunter) There was like a thousand players, and it was so hot. - And Daddy was pitching really hard. - Oh, yeah? And it was really hot, but it was fun, and I got my nose burnt really bad. Hm. The guy thought that the damn radar gun was broken. Do you know how many guys can throw the ball 98 miles an hour? - Not many. - You can count 'em on one hand. I still don't believe it. Those are major-league scouts on our message machine. I know. It's great. Oh, listen, honey, why didn't you tell me about all this? Well, I just... thought you'd laugh at me. - Oh, come on! - It was just this... It was this thing, to get the kids to start playing. I thought I'd just go there, I'd throw a few pitches, then I'd be done with it. So, you considerin' this? I... I don't know. I... I don't know, I... I have never thrown that hard before. - What? - Hm? You... you don't seem too excited. No, I am. Really. (TV commentator) It's a tough decision. Do you go ahead and call in your setup man to try to counter the left-handed batter with the lefty middle-reliever? (TV analyst) That's right, Tom. They have Johnson available, as well as Bisou, who did work one full inning on Tuesday night. (Tom) Yup, now it appears they've made up their minds and they're gonna go the setup route. And here comes Gray out of the bullpen, making the traditional run through the outfield to the mound. (analyst) I'm sure no matter how many times you've made that run, it still has to be quite a thrill. (Tom) Right you are, Jim. Back to the action. (turns off TV) Ain't nothin' wrong with that one right there. So much for his arm fallin' off. - Jimmy? - Yeah. Yes, sir. I was just driving by. I saw that your light was on. It'll be on for a few more hours. - You wanna come in? - Uh, no, it's all right. I was, um... I gotta be headin' back. I just, uh, wanted to, um... - Uh, Lorri called. - Yeah? Guess the scouts saw what they wanted to see. Well... I don't know what to do. Give it some time. (sighs) I haven't got a lot of that. - You're asking me? - (clears throat) (sighs) Yes, sir. Your grandfather once told me it was OK to think about what you want to do until it was time to start doing what you were meant to do. That may not be what you wanted to hear. - Good night, Jimmy. - Good night. I swear, sometimes I think he lies in bed at night, just figuring out the one thing that he can say that hurts the most. I was this close, thinking he was gonna give me some good advice. Maybe he did. What? Oh, boy. (sighs) Listen, Jimmy, I love you. Lord knows, I think it's great you're goin' out there and showin' up the kids at the tryout, but I'm a little concerned that you might be losin' sight of the fact you have a family who needs you, and a pretty decent job waitin' for you up at Fort Worth. For the record, all right, I never said I was gonna do this. Oh, come on, Jimmy, I know... Although I was hopin' for a bit more support on the home front. Oh, so this doesn't concern me, or the kids? You can't eat dreams, Jimmy, and they don't pay for clothes or shoes or gas or baby-sitters. Now, I do not want to be the bad guy on this, but somebody has got to start being rational around here. You know what? That's all I've been my whole life! Yeah, what about my life? I was there too, remember. Every time you got hurt, I got a front-row seat to watch you shut yourself off from the rest of the world, and from me. Truth is, I was happy when you quit. Happy. Yeah. 'Cause I don't wanna see you get hurt again. (Jimmy sighs) - Kids down? - For a while, at least. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. (sighs) - I've been thinkin'... - So have I. I think you should do this. - No, no. You were right. - No. I don't think so. (Lorri sighs) We've got an eight-year-old boy inside this house who waited all day in the sun and the rain to see his daddy try to do something that nobody believed he could do. Now, what are we tellin' him if... if you don't try now? I can't leave you here with all this. Jimmy Morris, I'm a Texas woman which means I don't need the help of a man to keep things runnin'. OK? OK. OK. Great. See you soon, little man. (Jimmy sighs) Hot dogs! Hot dogs! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. You the old guy? I'm the old guy. Come on, Rays! You're on a roll! (man) Hey, big time! You use a walker to get to the mound, or do the other players carry you? (2nd man) Hey, pitch, who'd you come up with? The Senators? (3rd man) What are they paying you? They ought to pay us to come see you! Welcome to last place! Hey, skipper! I didn't know it was bring-your-dad-to-work night! Oh, that's nice! Way to bring up his average! - Time! - Pitching change for Orlando. Now pitching, number nine... Johnny Morris. Check that. Jimmy Morris. And now, fans, it's time to guess the winning car! And a big crash at the first base line! Number one will win it this time! Work fast. We got a long bus trip. Let's go, Stingrays! ( "Wooly Bully" by Sam the Sham) Wooly bully Wooly bully Wooly bully Watch it, watch it, watch it You got it, you got it, you got it (music stops) (booing) (spectator) Hey, pitch! Do I look like a strike zone to you? - You stink! - (booing) (Lorri) I can't believe they let you pitch your first game. - How'd you do? - Not bad. Uh... (sighs) I had a few of 'em get away from me. - Did the fans all yell when you ran in? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. - They were yellin' all right. - Oh, honey, that's just great. - Let me get the kids. - Uh, no. Um... Just tell 'em I'll call 'em tomorrow from... wherever we're goin'. OK. I will. I love you. I love you too. Take care. - (crowd cheering) - You're out! Strike! (crowd booing) Blue! - (Jimmy) OK, what's four times four? - (Hunter) 17? No, it's not 17. You're guessing. Just add it up. - 16? - It's 16. You ought to be able to look at four times four and just know that it's 16 without even having to think about it, all right? - Now let's do your fives. - Aw, Daddy, I already done my fives. What's... Well, if you wanna learn how to multiply, you're gonna have to practice, bud. OK! - Hey, Dad. - Yeah, partner? Told you when you're goin' to the big leagues yet? (sighs) - Could you put your mom on, OK? - OK. Oh, thanks, hon. Hey. Jessie says they left you in one too many pitches. Jessie needs to learn how to keep a secret with her father. - How are things goin'? - Things are good. Hunter's got a field trip on Friday, and the rest of us are... - Honey, that's not what I meant. - I know. It's not bad. - But we're a little behind. - How much? Well, they took the bed, but they left the nightstand. (sighs) - You all right? - I'm just tired. - I love you. - Love you too. - Night. - OK, good night. Good night. Listen, man. This is the only long-distance phone we have here at the Ritz. You see someone waiting, you keep it to ten minutes, OK? What, now you all talked out? Huh! Use it all up on your girlfriend? It was my son. He needed help with his homework. Get outta here! It looks like a little screen time's coming for Kenny Justin. Jim! Hey, Jim, come here a minute. Jim, I want you to meet Tim Stewart from ABC News. Hey, Jim, it's a pleasure. Thanks for takin' some time with us. You wanna sit down? I got a jersey for ya. Can you believe that? I go four-for-five last night, and look where they got the camera. The man isn't pitchin' good enough to talk about it. Dude's old enough. He needs to talk about retirin'. Come on, let's go. Grab my magazine. Old Man River, you movin' kinda slow. - Yeah. Six hours on a bus. - Yeah? - Never mind. - Come on, man. I got just the recipe to loosen them bones up. Gentlemen... to the diet that put Babe Ruth in the Hall of Fame. Hey, River, what was it like watchin' the Babe play? Mm-hm. OK. You sure you wanna start this? How many fans did you guys lose when you raised ticket prices to 50 cents? - Not as many as we lose when you pitch. - Oh! And this game is over, baby. River, I swear, if you were this funny all the time, nobody'd say nothin'... About what? Who do you mean? What are they sayin', Brooks? Look, some of the guys figure, you know... the way the team's pushin' your story and all... Oh, what? Do they think I'm some kind of publicity stunt? Is that what they're thinkin'? They think I'm takin' somebody's spot? What do you think, Brooks? You're too fast for me. That's all I know. (cheering) Safe! Time! You want to warm up? - (Justin) Nice job, Brooks! - Yeah. - (fan) Don't expect a raise, Brooks! - Peanuts! (announcer) ..in Durham Bulls history. Now batting for the Bulls, number 38, Kenny Bryerson. Get your ice-cold soda! Mac, we both know it's gonna be Brooks. I've had more than one player called up before. Anybody my age? So what are you thinkin'? Uh, I got a... pile of unpaid bills at home, I got a good job there, I only make $600 a month here, and... I got a family I haven't seen in three months. You still got some season left. Somebody, uh... once told me that it's OK to think about what you want to do until it's time to start doing what you were meant to do. Just so you know, you were my best relief pitcher this past month. (sighs) Thanks, Mac. (Hunter) Jessica, give me that back! It's mine! - (Jessie) Get off me! - I'm gonna tell Mommy! - (phone ringing) - Come on! - Hey! Sh! - (Jessie) It's mine! (Hunter) You're gonna be in big trouble! - Hello? - (Jimmy) Hey. Hey! I didn't think I'd hear from you till tomorrow. I'm coming home. - What, did you get hurt? - No, I'm fine. Um... - It's just time. - You called Fort Worth, didn't you? Uh-huh. Uh... I told them I'd be there in two weeks. So, pitch for two weeks. - Mm. No, th-there's too much to do. - I'll take care of it. - We've been OK for three months. - Lorri... - We'll be OK for two weeks. - Lorri... (sighs) I'm... I'm wastin' my time out here. (sighs) Listen, Jimmy... Lord knows, I am ready for both sides of the bed to be warm again. But if you're gonna do this, you make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Because you're the one that's gonna have to live with it, OK? I'll be fine. You still love it? Just think about that, OK? ( "Holding Pattern" by Dave Hole) (TV) Finally tonight, dreams that don't die. In 1983 the Milwaukee Brewers drafted a pitcher named Jim Morris. You've never heard of him. Arm troubles. He quickly dropped out of baseball, married, had kids, taught high-school chemistry. While pitching batting practice to the high school kids, he found he was throwing the ball 95 mph! Faster than he could throw it years ago. He doesn't know how that happened, but guess what it did to his dream. Here's Aaron Brown. (Brown) Jim Morris is afraid to tell his mother he quit his old job as a high-school teacher for his new one, a relief pitcher in the minor leagues. He is really old, too old to be in the minors, but he's also throwing harder and better than he did as a 20-year-old kid, and so he's back in that strange and wonderful land called minor-league baseball, where the Bull snorts smoke on every home run and future stars run the bases between innings. (Jimmy on TV) I made a challenge to the guys to follow their dreams, really. - It was something to motivate them and... - ( child sings "Itsy-Bitsy Spider") They turned it around on me and told me I wasn't following my own dreams. - They're a great bunch of guys. - Be quiet. I'm tryin' to watch. The town has been very supportive of me. I grew up there. I have a lot of really good support from my family and friends and the townspeople around there. This game, it's been the true love of my life, other than my wife, Lorri, since I was a little boy. I had a dream as a little boy of playin' professional baseball. I used to pitch and imagine myself, you know, like every other kid in this country, of being in the World Series, pitchin' in the seventh game, ninth inning, big-league ballpark. There's drama in it, there's suspense. There's a camaraderie with the other players. The fans in the stadium. You add that to it, it's... it's a great game. (crowd cheering) Ready to play! Riv! You know what we get to do today, Brooks? We get to play baseball. - (cheering) - Two! (cheering and whistling) (announcer) 0-and-two the count on Williams. Morris really on top of his game. Coach is really bringin' it tonight. - Three! - Called strike three. Caught him lookin' with a fastball. That's Morris's third strikeout of the evening. (cheering) (fan) Smoke this guy, Jimmy! (yelling) (cheering) Thanks for cleaning up my mess tonight. You pitched seven good innings. I wouldn't call that a mess. Jimmy. Go ahead and close the door. Jimmy, I just got off the phone with a big club. They're callin' up Brooks. That's great. - He won't be back. - He respects you, and... I thought you might wanna be the one to tell him. Sure. Being as you're goin' too. They're callin' me up? Two of you fly out of here tonight. You catch up with the team tomorrow. - Where? - Well, they're on the road right now. In Texas. (phone rings) - Hello? - Hey, Lorri. - Hey, you! - Hey. Yeah, um... Do you know that blue sport coat that I never wear? Uh, hang on a sec, hon, I'm boiling over. (sighs) Now what about the blue sport coat you never wear? Would you mind bringin' it to Arlington tomorrow? Arlington? I thought you were in... You tell me right now, Jimmy Morris. Uh... Apparently, there's a dress code in the major leagues. - Lorri? - Yeah, I'm here. They're flyin' me out in an hour. - Can you tell everybody? - Sure. You just have to tell one person first. Hunter! Your daddy's got something he wants to tell you. - (Hunter) Hey, Dad. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, guess what. - What? Um... Your daddy is gonna be a major-league pitcher. - Really? - Yeah, really. What do you think about that, huh? Cool. I can't believe it. Who you gonna play for? - They're called the Devil Rays. - What's a devil ray? Uh, it's a fish. - What color is it? - Black. - Can you eat it? - I don't know, bud. - It's got a stinger. - That's cool. My daddy's a big-league pitcher! (cheering, horn blaring) Coach Morris made it! Coach Morris made it to the bigs! He's a big-leaguer now! ( "There is a Light" by Duane Jarvis) There is a light at the edge of the shadows Show a little faith and try and believe Meditate on your promise Drop down on your knees before you leave There is a light at the edge of the shadows There is a light ( birdsong echoes) Team won't be here for a couple of hours. Feel free to look around. We ain't in Kansas anymore, are we, Riv? (announcer) Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ballpark in Arlington. It's baseball time in Texas. Tonight's game, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays against your Texas Rangers! Hmm. Jimmy! - Jimmy Morris! - Dad! - Hi, Dad. - Hi! Ha-ha! You look great. - Kids, doesn't your daddy look great? - Yep. (Lorri) Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. I can't believe it! (giggles) - Sweetheart. - Hi, Daddy. - You're so big. - Yeah. Hey, partner. - I missed you. - Me too. (announcer) Here are the starting lineups for tonight's game... Well, kids, we'd better let your daddy get to work. See ya after. OK. (announcer) At the Ballpark, the Devil Rays went down 1-2-3 in the top of the first and now the Rangers try to get their high-scoring offense on track in the bottom of the first. Leading off for the Rangers, center fielder, number 24, Tom Goodwin. (cheering) Three balls and a strike. One out. Pitch on the way... It is low. Ball four. Runners in first and second. Good scoring chance for Texas. Here's the pitch. It is swung on and lined to center field. A base hit. A run will score. Top of the second. Rangers have a 1-0 lead. There's a swing and a base hit to right field, and this game is now a 1-1 tie. A reminder, the Devil Rays and Rangers... Last of the fourth inning about to get under way. Rangers 1 and the Devil Rays 1. - The pitch in the dirt again. - (phone rings) The third one he has thrown. And we're about to get some action in the Tampa Bay bullpen. Blanton, Miller. The pitch is on the way. Swung on, and a shot to the gap in right center field. It looks like extra bases. One run is home. Two runs are home. The throw cut off. The play at third. And out at third base! Rangers 3, Devil Rays 1, here in the bottom of the sixth. Runners in first and second. A golden chance for the Rangers. Here's the set. A pitch on the way. A swing and a smash up the alley on left center field. That will score two. It's the Rangers 5, the Devil Rays 1. Texas has broken it open. The Devil Rays and Rangers also play on Sunday night. - Game time is 7:05, and it's Cap Night. - (phone rings) All fans 13 and under receive a Rangers cap. Game time Sunday is 7:05. Morris, start warmin' up. Mommy, that's Daddy in the bullpen. Oh, my Lord. Hey, hey, guys, there he is. There he is, there he is. He's in the bullpen. There he is! Looks good. Come here. Have a look-see. Blanton trying to get out of a bases-loaded jam. There's a swing and a smash right back at him. He retrieves the ball in front of the mound. Throws to first. And he throws it away. Another run will come. Two runs for Texas on the play, and the Rangers have busted this game wide open. And Blanton may be hurt on that rocket right back to the mound. Jim Morris continues to throw in the bullpen, the left-hander from Big Lake, Texas. - Lookit, it's Coach. - Yeah! - Let's go! Come on! - Let's go, Coach! (announcer) The Tampa Bay trainer is on his way out to the mound to check. It appears the Devil Rays might have to make a pitching change. Morris! You're in! (cheering) - Yeah! - Go, coach! Whoo! (whistles) - Yeah! - Let's go, Coach! Go, Coach! (TV Reporter) Just three months ago, he was grading chemistry tests. And now Jim Morris finds himself on the mound in a major-league ballpark. Little louder than back home? Well, then, let's not make this too hard. You remember that fastball you were showin' me before the game? - I think so. - Well, I need three of 'em. (announcer) Coming in to pitch for Tampa Bay, a fellow Texan, making his major-league debut, Jim Morris. Morris will be facing Ranger shortstop Royce Clayton. Royce has had a very strong second half, and has not cooled off any here in the month of September. Come on, Dad! (cheering and clapping) (cheering swells) - Yeah! - Yes! (player) One more time! - Strike two! - Aw, what? Yeah! Whoo! Go on, Jimmy! Whoo! - Whoo! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Good work! - Congratulations, man. - Thanks, man. Jimmy, what pitches did you throw to get that strikeout? Um... - Fastball... - Mm. fastball and... fastball. How did it feel, pitchin' in the major leagues? - Just like I hoped it would. - How's the arm feel? Um... Uh, could you excuse me just for one second? Excuse me. Sir. I-I didn't know you were here. Wasn't missin' this one. Watching you tonight... Not many fathers get a chance to do that. I guess I let too many of those things get away. (deep sigh) S... so did I. Well, then. Hey, Dad? Yeah? Thanks for coming. Does this mean I don't get a baseball? - That's all I got left. - Oh, a girl could do worse. So, how did it feel to be the oldest rookie in the last 30 years? Well, I don't know. - I'm... I'm tired. - (laughs) So, where are the kids? Hunter is with Henry and Jessie's with Cal. Oh, don't tell me you left Jessie with Cal. Oh, Cal had a little help. (cheering and applause) Dad! ( "Some Dreams" by Steve Earle) When I was a little guy My daddy told me "Mister Don't ever try to climb too high 'Cause it's the fall that gets ya And some dreams will never come true They'll never come true" Well, I heard every word he said But I don't guess I listened And every time I banged my head Against the wall insistin' That some dreams don't ever come true Some dreams - Don't ever come true - Some dreams Oh, but some dreams do If you just hang on And your heart is true And your hope is strong Well, just because you've been around And had your poor heart broken Ain't no excuse for lyin' down Before the last word's spoken Cos some dreams don't ever come true Some dreams Don't ever come true - Some dreams - Oh, but some dreams do When you're feelin' low And you think you're through That's when you will know Yeah, when you wish upon a star Buddy, don't you miss it Catch it 'fore it falls too far And keep it with your secrets Cos some dreams don't ever come true Some dreams - Don't ever come true - Some dreams - Will never come true - Some dreams Oh, but some dreams do ( "Shining" by Eileen Rose) Sore head and I'm calling rain Full stop Home to meet my momma's pain Cry like she does Try like she does Oh, the world still loves a dreamer Keep on, keep on, keep on Keep on, keep on shining Keep on, keep on, keep on Keep on shining
