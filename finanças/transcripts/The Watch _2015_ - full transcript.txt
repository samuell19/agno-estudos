A DYING TOXIC TOWN, ABANDONED BUT FOR A FEW DESPERATE SOULS. CHEETO HERE IS ONE OF THEM. THIS MAN IS DETERMINED TO SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVE WHATEVER IS LEFT TO SAVE HERE. ALRIGHT. YOU LOOK TIRED CHEETO. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING WELL I WISH I COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT, BUT ME I NEVER SLEEP. THAT DOESN'T STOP ME FROM DOING MY JOB, AND IT SHOULDN'T STOP YOU. USED TO BE FAMILIES HERE. NOW THIS PLACE IS REALLY, REALLY TORE UP. YOU GOT VANDALS. METH HOUSES. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO STEAL. TEAR UP. DESTROY. SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE NO HONOR. HONOR THIS PLACE. HONOR WHAT IT ONCE MEANT. I DON'T KNOW THOUGH. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO MOVE INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT. MAYBE IT'S TIME WE MOVE INTO AN EYE FOR AN EYE. WE'RE ALL TRANSIENTS, TO AN EXTENT, MOVING THROUGH LIFE IN OUR MARCH TOWARD THE GRAVE. JUST PASSING THRU. MY SUBJECTS LIVE ALONE AND RARELY ARE THEY INTRUDED UPON. BUT FOR ME, AND MY LITTLE "EXPERIMENT" IT'S WHEN THEIR ISOLATED WORLD IS INVADED THAT THINGS GET INTERESTING. PICHER, A TOWN LEFT TO ROT IN THE OKLAHOMA SUN, HAS ITS SHARE OF VAGABONDS. BUT MY FRIEND CHEETO IS FINDING OUT THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST PROMOTING DECAY... THEY'RE DESTROYING MEMORIES. I NOTICE THIS CRUISING BY THE OTHER DAY. HADN'T BEEN INSIDE. LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK. IT IS SOMETHING ELSE. HOLY MOLY! THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE. LOOK AT THIS. STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN. IF ONLY I COULD TAKE IN THAT SMELL. MMMMM... I IMAGINE IT'S LIKE WHAT I SMELLED IN EGYPTIAN TOMBS, LITTERED WITH ANCIENT MUMMIES. OR PERHAPS THE SWEET FRAGRANCE FOUND INSIDE AN OLD COFFIN. THE SMELL OF MEMORIES. I'LL BE. LOOK AT THAT. I'LL BE DAMNED. "HAPPY EASTER GRANNY!" "4-11-93" WOW. SOMEWHERE, TO SOMEBODY, THIS WAS GRANDMA'S HOUSE. LOTS OF MEMORIES. I'M SURE I DON'T MEAN TO BE STEPPING ON IT BUT THERE'S JUST NOWHERE ELSE TO WALK. THIS IS CRAZY. IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY JUST UP AND DISAPPEARED. DISAPPEARED TO WHERE, OR IS IT, INTO WHAT? HEY, HO, HO, HO. SEE, LOOK AT THAT. LOOKS LIKE GRANDMA'S HOUSE HAS TURNED INTO A DEAD HOST, FOR PARASITES TO FEED ON ITS MEMORIES. YOU KNOW, THIS IS DELIBERATE DESTRUCTION. CHECK THAT OUT. NOW THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THIS BED LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE IS WHAT YOU FIND IN METH HOUSES. YOU NEVER KNOW MAN, YOU NEVER KNOW. CATCH 'EM EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. THEY'RE ABOUT SECOND UP THERE WITH SNAKES. AND I AIN'T REAL FRIENDLY WITH EITHER ONE AND I DON'T GIVE A **** IF THEY LIKE ME OR NOT. I LIKE CHEETO. HARDENED, TAKE NO PRISONERS. MOTIVATED TO CREATE CHANGE, EVEN HERE. A BEAUTIFUL, YET FUTILE CAUSE. I'D LIKE TO CATCH ONE OF THESE SUCKERS. SEE IF I CHANGE THIS TUNE A LITTLE BIT. JUST LOVE THESE STAIRS. MY DEAR BROOKS, TOILING AWAY AS KEEPER OF THE LIGHT HERE ON RACE ROCK. WHAT INVADERS DO YOU SEEK? I'M USUALLY USED TO GOING FROM POINT A TO POINT B. NOT THIS TIME. YOU KNOW I'M STUCK OUT HERE. THAT'S THE HARD PART. IT'S THE SEPARATION FROM MY FAMILY. MY DAUGHTER, MY GRANDDAUGHTERS. I CAN'T SEE THEM. AT SOME POINT I'M GOING TO TRY AT LEAST GET OFF THE ROCK SO I DON'T FEEL SO TRAPPED. BUT I'M ON A MISSION THAT I WANT TO COMPLETE. AND I'D SAY I DO IT. SO I'LL DO IT. OK WILBUR. THERE'S SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE STILL. IT'S, IT'S TRULY AMAZING. COMING DOWN THE HOME STRETCH WILBUR. ONE MORE. OK, THIS IS IT WILBUR. FRIENDS, DID YOU NOTICE THAT? SAY THAT AGAIN TO YOU WILBUR? THE POISON ROOM IS DONE! BROOKS HAS NAMED HER CAMERA. OR NAMED ME, HER ONLY FRIEND, HER COMPANION WITH WHOM TO SHARE HER THOUGHTS. I WONDER WHERE THAT CAME FROM? WILBUR. SOMEONE REASSURING, I IMAGINE, COMFORTABLE, SAFE. OKAY, TWO PEOPLE. BOTH NAMED WILBUR. MY DAD AND MY BROTHER. MY DAD AND MY BROTHER BOTH PASSED. SO I CAN'T TALK TO THEM ANYMORE. SO, YOU KNOW WHAT. FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE WILBUR. I LIKE THAT. ON TO THE NEXT ACTIVITY. CAN'T SEE OUT THESE WINDOWS. THEY ARE SO CAKED WITH SALT. DOESN'T BUDGE BY HAND. LET ME TRY IT THIS WAY. I'LL BET I CAN GET UNDERNEATH IT ON THE OUTSIDE. OK WILBUR. THERE IT IS AGAIN... WILBUR. I OFTEN SEE THIS IN MY WORK, HOW THE LONELY PERSONIFY OBJECTS. AND WHY BROOKS ARE YOU USING IT NOW WHILE PRYING OPEN A WINDOW? WHEN MY BROTHER WILBUR DIED. HE WAS IN HIS BEDROOM LOOKING OUT AT RACE ROCK ACTUALLY. I SAID HE'S PROBABLY GOT ONE FOOT IN THE DINGY AND ONE ON THE DOCK. SO I SAID, TELL HIM IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY TO GET IN THE BOAT. YES. AND AN HOUR LATER, JUST AS HE STARTED TO CLOSE HIS EYES AND PASS AWAY, A WIND BLEW IN THE WINDOW. AND HE WAS GONE. SO I KNOW HIS SPIRIT'S HERE. I KNOW HE'S WITH ME ALL THE TIME. BOTH MY DAD AND MY BROTHER WATCH OUT FOR ME. COME ON. YES, ALL RIGHTY THEN! I KNOW YOU WANT TO WATCH, WILBUR. THE DERELICTS OF PICHER, AND BROOK'S MEMORIES... ARE INTRUDERS MY SUBJECTS SEEK. FOR BILLY, CARE-TAKING THIS ABANDONED AMUSEMENT PARK, HE SEEKS THE SPIRITUAL KIND. THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD. SUPPOSEDLY LEFT BEHIND AT THIS ABANDONED AMUSEMENT PARK. I'VE BEEN THINKING OF DEATH, A LOT. I AM KEENLY AWARE OF THE FRAGILITY OF LIFE, OF THINGS ENDING. ALL THINGS END, EVERYTHING ENDS. THERE IS A BURIAL SITE HERE ON THIS PROPERTY. I DO MY BEST TO RESPECT IT. SO THIS IS THE HEADSTONE. IT SAYS "IN MEMORY OF BARTLEY AND TABITHA CLAY." THEY WERE CHILDREN OF THE VERY FIRST WHITE SETTLER, HE WAS AWAY HUNTING FOR A FEW DAYS, AND IN HIS ABSENCE THE... SHAWNEE INDIANS ATTACKED. AND THEY WERE BURIED RIGHT HERE. EXACTLY RIGHT HERE. LET'S GET TO CLEANING IT UP. BILLY SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HEART, DON'T YOU THINK? TAKING CARE OF THE WHAT REMAINS OF THE DEAD. EVEN THOSE WITHOUT HEADSTONE. THERE WERE, MANY NATIVE AMERICANS WHO DIED HERE. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL INDIAN BURIAL GROUNDS ON THE PROPERTY HERE. SO, AND I SUSPECT THE KIDS DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THEIR HOUSE, THEIR LAND. SO THE INDIANS LOOKED AT THEM AS INTRUDERS, THEY LOOKED AT THE INDIANS AS INTRUDERS... IF THERE ARE IN FACT ENERGY AND SPIRITS HERE, WHICH I BELIEVE THERE ARE, IT WOULD APPEAR AS IF SOME OF THEM LOOK AT ME AS AN INTRUDER. WELL. INTERESTING. I SUPPOSE THAT MAKES ME AN INTRUDER TOO. NO MATTER. WHAT I FIND SO FASCINATING IS BILLY'S SEEKING SPIRITUAL INTRUDERS, WHILE DAILY PATROL OF THE GROUNDS REQUIRES HE KEEP OUT THE HUMAN KIND. GATE LOOKS SECURE. THIS IS A CONFLICT I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF. YOU KNOW, YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO RUN INTO. SO YOU GOT TO CHECK EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING IS DECEIVING HERE. EVERYTHING IS DECEIVING. WELL, WELL... WHAT HAVE WE HERE? WHAT THE... WASN'T HERE LAST NIGHT. THEY LOOK OLD. EVEN THE NOOSES LOOK OLD. IS THIS A JOKE? WAS IT THE KIDS, OR SOMEBODY PLAYING A PRANK? JUST TO MESS WITH ME? SOME RETRIBUTION OR SOMETHING DARKER THAN THAT? I DON'T KNOW. WELL BILLY, THIS CERTAINLY IS AN AMUSEMENT PARK. WELL WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION. I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE. I'D LIKE YOU GUYS COME AND VISIT ME. ALL ALONE, WATCHING OVER A MONTANA RANCH, DAVE HOPES NOT ONLY TO BE VISITED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS; HE WANTS TO BE SPIRITED AWAY. I WONDER IF THEY SERVE PEANUTS ON THAT FLIGHT? I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED I HAVEN'T ASCENDED YET... CONSCIOUSLY AND PHYSICALLY. I THINK WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO TELL ME IS THAT I'M STILL NOT PURE ENOUGH. I'M STILL OF THIS WORLD. COME HERE BUDDY. YOU GUYS CAN TALK TO ME UP ON THOSE CLOUDS. I SEE YOU! YOU SEE ME! COME ON! I'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS ENTIRE PLANET. I'VE ALREADY DONE 100 COUNTRIES AND 109 ISLANDS. THIS IS NOT HOME FOR ME. HOME, WHO'S TO SAY WHAT HOME IS? TAKE THESE DUCKS. ALL THEY KNOW ARE WOODEN WALLS, BITS OF STRAW... DAVE AND ME. IS THAT HOME? YES, BUT WHERE THEY'RE MEANT TO BE? IT'S A CRAP MESS. MUD, GUCKY, NASTY. IT'S OVERCROWDED IN HERE FOR THEM. IT'S TOO MUCH... I THINK I HAVE TO LET THIS CLUCK CLUCKS GO. AND PUT THEM IN THE POND. AND LET THEM DO THEIR OWN THING. IF I LET THE DUCKS GO, WHO KNOWS, ALIENS MIGHT EVEN SHOW UP AND SAY, "HEY THIS GUY IS OK, YOU KNOW, WE CAN TALK, WE ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL." I'M HOPING FOR ALL THAT. SO IT'S THAT SIMPLE DAVE? ALL LIFE IS, IS JUST DO A GOOD DEED. IN THE HOPES OF BEING CHOSEN? HOW SO, SO RELIGIOUS OF YOU. LIFE MY FRIEND, ISN'T SO BLACK AND WHITE. THE DUCKS DO YOUR CALLING, NOT THEIR OWN. THEY LIVE AND DIE HERE NOT BY THEIR OWN HAND... THEY ARE PAPER BOATS ON THE TURBULENT TIDES OF LIFE. AND SO DAVE... ARE YOU. BUT YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT THAT WAY, WILL YOU? JUST GOTTA CONTINUE DOING MY BEST. FINISH MY JOB HERE ON THIS RANCH. AND THEN ON THIS EARTH SO I CAN LEAVE. HERE IN PICHER, CHEETO'S SEEKING INTRUDER'S FOR AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASON. YESTERDAY I WAS RIDING OVER BY THAT CHAT PILE AND I NOTICED SOME FRESH TRACKS. I WANT TO GO BACK UP THERE TODAY AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. MOUNDS OF MINING WASTE ARE THE LANDSCAPE HERE. THESE PILES OF CHAT ARE THE PLAYGROUND. THERE'S SOMEBODY UP THERE. I'M GOING TO GET 'EM IN CAMERA. CUS' THERE'S SOMEBODY UP THERE. WHAT'S A LONELY WATCHMAN TO DO? MAKE A FRIEND? SCARE THEM OFF? OR RIGHT A WRONG AND FIGURE IF THIS IS WHO DARED INVADE GRANDMA'S HOUSE. NOT SURE WHAT HE'S DOING BUT I'M GOING TO GET UP THERE I'M GOING TO FIND OUT. I TELL YOU WHAT; LOT'S OF PEOPLE JUST COME AROUND AND DUMP GARBAGE. TIRED, COUCHES, SHELLS. THAT KIND OF **** JUST BURNS MY ASS MAN. HE'S STILL UP THERE. HERE WE GO. I'M HOPING HE DON'T SKEDADDLE OUT OF HERE. BEFORE I GET TO HIM. YEAH, I DUNNO IF YOU CAN CATCH HIM BUT HE HAS HIS BACK TURNED TO US. LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET HIM. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. I STILL GOT HIM. THERE HE IS HEY, HEY! THIS JACKWAGGON'S GOING TO MAKE ME CLIMB THIS HILL. IF I CAN GET MY HAND ON HIM ABOUT NOW. DAMN, TOOK OFF ON THAT LITTLE MINI BIKE RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THERE. HE ALREADY WENT DOWN THE HILL. YEAH, HERE'S HIS TRACKS RIGHT HERE. CHECK THIS OUT. THAT'S NOT THE ONLY SET I SEE. THERE'S 3 OR 4 SETS RUNNING DOWN THROUGH HERE. UNLESS HE'S BEEN MAKING MULTIPLE TRIPS, THERE'S PROBABLY BEEN SOMEBODY ELSE UP HERE TOO. I CANNOT BELIEVE I MISSED HIM. REALLY SKETCHY. BET SOMETHING FREAKY IS GOING ON. I HAVE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THESE GUYS ARE GETTING IN. I DUNNO IF IT'S ONE GUY, TWO GUYS. A DAGUM HERD OF THEM. THEY GOTTA BE GETTING DOWN THAT BACK SIDE SOMEHOW. WELL, I DIDN'T CATCH THAT JACKWAGGON THIS TIME... HE AIN'T THE FIRST ONE AND AIN'T GOING TO BE THE LAST ONE. SEEKING... THEY'RE ALWAYS SEEKING. SEEKING A CONNECTION. NEXT TIME. HUMANS BUILD RELATIONSHIPS... WE'RE WIRED THAT WAY... SO WHAT HAPPENS, WHEN THEY'RE TAKEN AWAY? TODAY I'M ALMOST PARALYZED. CUS' I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RELEASE THE DUCKIES. THEY'RE OVERGROWN THEIR LITTLE PLACE BUT THIS IS HOW LIFE IS. JUST YOU GOT TO ROLL. HEY SARGE! I GOT TO GO CHECK ON THE DUCKS. WATCH THE PLACE FOR ME FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUDDY. OK? I'LL SEE YOU IN A WHILE. HEY QUACK QUACKS. ARE YOU GUYS GETTING TIRED OF BEING IN THIS PLACE? I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS RIGHT NOW FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S A DANGEROUS WORLD OUT THERE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. IT'S GRADUATION DAY. STEP RIGHT UP. LET'S GO. COME ON. DON'T RESIST CLUCKIES. COME ON CLUCKIES. I GOT TWO! QUACK-QUACK. LET'S ROLL! I RAISED THESE BEAUTIFUL GUYS. IT'S FUN SHARING WITH THEM AND BEING A PART OF THEIR DEAL, BUT ALL ANIMALS SHOULD BE FREE. OK, IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL MOMENT FOR ME RIGHT NOW. I'M ABOUT TO LET THESE GUYS GO. HERE WE GO. FORGIVE ME FOR BEING SO METAPHORICAL, BUT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT DAVE'S JEALOUS OF THE DUCKS NEW PASSAGE. FOR HE ISN'T GETTING HIS OWN. GOODBYE BABY. ENJOY OK? THERE YOU GO. HE'S HAPPY. LOOK AT THAT. SEE YOU CLUCKIES. BUT DAVE, AT LEAST YOU HAVE SARGE. YOUR COMPANION FOR OVER 30 YEARS NOW. HEY SARGE, THE LITTLE CLUCKIES ARE FREE! THAT'S KILLER, YOU LIKE THAT. JUST AS THE LONELY CLING TO RELATIONSHIPS. EVEN THOSE THAT AREN'T HUMAN, HOW THOSE TRULY ALONE, IN TIME OF CRISIS IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MATTER. AS A CONFESSED OBSESSIVE WATCHER, I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF SEEING PEOPLE'S MINDS PLAY TRICKS ON THEM. INVADERS, OF THE IMAGINATION, SO TO SPEAK. AND NOTHING DOES THAT MORE, THAN SOMETHING GOING BUMP IN THE NIGHT. WHAT THE **** WAS THAT? THERE IT IS AGAIN. THE ATTIC! I GOT TO GO SEE WHAT THAT IS. OK WILBUR, I GOTTA BE NUTS. I GOT TO BE OUT OF MY MIND. MY GOD. DEAD BIRD. ONE, TWO THREE, DEAD BIRDS. THAT IS TRULY WEIRD. SOME MYTHS SAY THAT A BIRD INSIDE THE HOUSE IS AN OMEN OF IMMINENT DEATH. HOW INTERESTING. LOOK AT THE TRACKS. NO BIRD DID THIS. I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE. WHO, WHO'S IN THE ATTIC MOVING FURNITURE? I DON'T KNOW. BUT I CAN TELL YOU. THERE'S LITERALLY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF LIVES LOST BECAUSE OF THIS REEF THAT THIS LIGHTHOUSE IS BUILT ON SO I'M SURE THERE COULD BE BE THERE'S CROWDS OF SPIRITS HERE. I DON'T KNOW. WILBUR, MY GOD! NOW THIS IS INTERESTING. BROOKS, I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE PRAGMATIC SAILOR, WITH A HARDENED SHELL IMPENETRABLE BY MERE GHOSTS AND GOBLINS. I KEEP TRYING TO FIND A RATIONAL REASON FOR WHAT I'M HEARING AND, WELL MAYBE IT IS HAUNTED. BUT I CAN TELL YOU, BEING HERE BY MYSELF, IF I PANIC, I'LL REALLY BE IN TROUBLE. WHEN YOU PANIC, YOU CAN'T THINK THROUGH STUFF. I'LL TURN MY FAN ON. I'LL TURN THE FAN ON. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT **** AGAIN. THERE'S THE PRAGMATIC BROOKS I KNOW SO WELL. I LEARNED FROM MY DAD, IT'S NOT THE PROBLEM THAT COUNTS, IS HOW YOU DEAL WITH IT. QUITE TRUE. SO, HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH IT BROOKS? GOOD NIGHT WILBUR. IF BIRDS INSIDE THE HOUSE PREDICT YOUR DEMISE... SARGE! WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN A PET MACAW HAS UP AND VANISHED? COME ON. SARGE! THIS IS KIND OF AN EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW. MY BIRD IS NOWHERE IN SIGHT. SARGE, SARGE?! OK, WHERE'S MY BIRD, I'M PANICKED. SARGE! I UNDERSTAND YOUR DISTRESS DAVE. TO THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS, BIRDS HELD VERY SPECIAL POWERS. THEY WERE GODS AND PROTECTORS, GATEKEEPERS TO THE HEAVENS. SARGE COULD BE THE TICKET TO YOUR GREAT ESCAPE. IS THAT THE ALIENS TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING? AM I SUPPOSED TO LEARN A LESSON HERE? AFTER ALL THE GOOD THINGS I'VE DONE? SARGE, SARGE, SARGE!? THERE HE IS! HE'S WAY UP THERE. DADDY'S RIGHT HERE. COME ON DOWN. YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT BUDDY! MY PARROT IS UP IN THIS TREE AND HE WON'T COME DOWN. SARGE HAS NEVER BEEN UP IN A TREE THIS HIGH IN HIS LIFE. WELL DAVE, BIRDS ARE MEANT TO FLY. MAYBE YOU THINK HE'S TRYING TO TELL YOU A REBELLION IS ON ITS WAY. AN ESCAPE IS NEAR. COME ON SARGE. EVEN IF A GUST OF WIND WERE TO WHISK HIM AWAY, FOR A DIFFERENT SORT OF DEPARTURE. SARGE! COME DOWN. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING'S REALLY BREWING. SARGE, COME ON SARGE! I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I GOT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO. SARGE, SARGE, SARGE, SARGE! MY GOSH. NOOOO, MY BIRD! I'LL LOSE MY MIND IF I LOSE MY BIRD. SARGE! I HEAR YOU. WHERE ARE YOU SARGE? ARE YOU OK? HE'S COVERED. SO MAYBE HE'LL BE SAFE. I'M VERY, VERY CONCERNED RIGHT NOW. HE USUALLY SITS RIGHT HERE. NEXT TO ME. THIS IS GOING TO BE A WEIRD NIGHT. THE MIND, WHEN LEFT ALONE, IS AN INTERESTING THING TO WATCH. AND WHAT THAT MIND DREAMS... SARGE! MAY BE THE PORTAL TO THE SOUL. ANOTHER DAY. ANOTHER AMAZING EVENING OF WILD DREAMS I'M HAVING. YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF GETTING A FUNNY FEELING THAT MY BIRD, HE'S REALIZED THAT HE WANTS TO BE FREE. SARGE, MY GOSH. LOOK AT THIS. MY GOSH, HE'S COMING. COME ON SARGE. DADDY'S RIGHT HERE, COME ON. I'M LIKE SO FREAKING BLOWN AWAY EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW. AND THERE HE IS. SARGE, DID YOU ENJOY THAT? THAT'S KILLER. WHO'S TO SAY WHAT SARGE WAS DOING? AN ATTEMPT AT FREEDOM, LIKE THE DUCKS? OR MAYBE CONNECTING WITH THE INVADERS DAVE SEEKS. DEPENDS ON HOW FAR ONE IS WILLING TO REACH, FOR AN ANSWER. IS EVERYTHING COOL. COMMUNICATION CAN COME IN SO MANY GLORIOUS FORMS. CLOWNS HUNG BY NOOSES IS QUITE A FIRST DATE. IS THIS A JOKE? THE PARK WANTS TO PLAY BILLY, DO YOU? THIS SHOULD BE FUN. I'VE BEEN SAVING UP A LITTLE MAKE UP. FOR TONIGHT. FIGURING THAT THE SPIRITS COULD USE A LITTLE FUN. BILLY WANTS SO BADLY TO COMMUNICATE, HE'S WILLING TO INVENT HIS OWN LANGUAGE, WITH A GREASEPAINT AND MASCARA ALPHABET. DON'T WORRY. THESE ARE NOT GOING TO BE TEARS. SO YEAH, CLOWNS ARE FUNNY, I THINK NO MATTER WHAT. I JUST HAPPEN TO LIKE THEM. OK. CLOWNS TO THE LEFT AND JOKERS TO THE RIGHT. HERE I AM. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. I'M HEADED OVER TO WHERE MOST OF THE SPIRITS ARE GOING TO BE. THAT IS OVER BY THE SWINGS AND THE FERRIS WHEEL. BILLY WANTS TO PLEASE. TO ENTERTAIN. TO BE ONE WITH HIS APPARITION FAMILY. I THINK THE KIDS AND THE INDIANS AND THE SPIRITS, EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HAVE A SURPRISINGLY GOOD LITTLE TIME. I WONDER WHAT OUR CARETAKER FRIEND HAS IN MIND? ALL RIGHT, SO... HEY KIDS. LET'S HAVE A SHOW WITH SOME FIREWORKS. LET'S LIGHT 'EM UP! THERE THEY GO. THAT WAS GOOD. WHAT ELSE WE GOT? WOW, WOO-HOO! HEY KIDS. HOW WAS THAT? WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT IT'S REALLY OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE SPIRITS OF THE PARK. THERE YOU GO KIDS. I LOVE TO SEE AND HEAR KIDS RUNNING AROUND, LAUGHING, PLAYING, SCREAMING. GIGGLING... THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO ENDURE NOT JUST CONFINEMENT BUT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. I IMAGINE IT'S THE WORST SORT OF TORTURE A PRISONER CAN FACE. AND TRUST ME... I KNOW. AT THAT POINT ALL ANYBODY CAN IMAGINE... EVEN SOMEONE LIKE BROOKS IS TO ESCAPE. WHY DON'T WE SEE IF WE CAN GET OFF THIS ROCK? I'M THINKING ABOUT GETTING GET THE KAYAK IN THE WATER. I USED TO BE A SEVERE CLAUSTROPHOBIC. MAYBE I STILL HAVE A LITTLE CLAUSTROPHOBIA BECAUSE I'D REALLY LIKE TO BE OFF THE ROCK. BUT WHY FACE RIPPING CURRENTS AND CHOPPY SEAS TO PADDLE AROUND THE ISLAND? SEEMS A BIT, EXTREME. WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT, MY DEAR BROOKS? I WOULDN'T SAY I KNOW ENOUGH TO GET MYSELF IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. BUT TRUTH IS DAD TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING I KNOW. YOU STILL SEEK THE CONNECTIONS, THE MEMORIES THIS PLACE CAN OFFER? PERHAPS I'M JUST NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU. THIS IS THE MAN I REVERED. MY MENTOR. PASSED TOOLS TO AS A KID AND HELD THE FLASHLIGHT. LEARNED A THOUSAND RULES NUMBER ONES. "DON'T GO EMPTY HANDED AND A CLEAN SHIP IS A HAPPY SHIP." BEAUTIFUL. LEARNED TO LOOK FOR THE HUMOR IN LIFE BECAUSE OF DAD. MY PRETTY. THIS IS GOING TO BE SO SEXY. AND HE WAS GONE, I COULDN'T WRAP MY BRAIN AROUND IT. HIS ASHES WERE PUT IN THE WATER NOT FAR FROM HERE. IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS AND A LOT OF TIDES HAVE GONE BY BUT. IT'S STILL HARD, BUT I KNOW HE'S HERE. I MISS YOU DAD. AND WE'RE AFLOAT! OK, WILBUR. THIS IS IT, THE MOMENT OF TRUTH. SON OF A BITCH. NO! - I - LOVE THE WATCHING. WHAT WE LEARN. PRETTY GOOD FOR ALMOST 70. WE'RE AWAY. YEE-HAW! YOU SPY A KAYAK PADDLING AROUND THE ROCK. I SPY SOMEONE CONNECTING WITH THE PAST. I FELT MY DAD WAS WATCHING ME, HELPING ME. HE LOVED TO DO THIS KIND OF STUFF. YEE-HAW, FREE AT LAST! I WAS PROUD OF MYSELF. I WAS PROUD THAT I AM ABLE TO USE EXPERIENCES FROM THE PAST. LIKE, I NEVER COULD HAVE RIGGED THAT KAYAK WHEN I WAS 22... NO WAY. WITHIN EYESIGHT OF WHERE HER FATHER AND BROTHER DIED, BROOKS IS RIDING THE SWELLS OF HER PAST. AND YOU KNOW, ISN'T IT ALWAYS THAT GREATEST THINGS YOU DO AND NOBODY SEES IT? WOW DOES IT FEEL GOOD. BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I KNOW WHAT I DID. DAD KNOWS WHAT I DID. THANKS DAD. THE WAY PEOPLE TALK TO THE DEAD HAS ALWAYS FASCINATED ME. A DESIRE TO CONNECT, I SUPPOSE. FOR BILLY, HOWEVER, IT SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A NEED. THIS PARK IS DEAD, RIGHT? IT'S NOT OPERATING. I BELIEVE IT'S VERY MUCH ALIVE WITH SPIRITUAL PRESENCE. THERE'S THIS WEIRD LIFE/DEATH DYNAMIC THAT EXISTS HERE. KIND OF GIVES ME THE FEELING THAT CERTAINLY THINGS ARE NOT ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM. I DON'T THINK OF IT AS A SAD PLACE. IT'S A SACRED PLACE. YOU'RE REMEMBERED. YOU'RE REMEMBERED AND YOU'RE RESPECTED. AND THIS PLACE IS SACRED AND I AM THANKFUL THAT YOU ALLOW ME TO COME HERE. FEEL THIS PEACE AND THIS ENERGY. ALL THIS SEARCHING, ALL THIS DESPERATE NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD ALL THE EFFORT, POINTLESS. MAYBE ALL BILLY NEEDS IS HIMSELF. HEY BILLY. HEY. SO WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY? CARE-TAKING. ANYTHING ELSE? THINKING. YOU SEEM TO WRITE A LOT. YUP. DO YOU EVER GET BORED? NOPE. HOW ABOUT SCARED? SURE. DO YOU EVER GET LONELY? BUT BILLY, WHAT IF THESE CONVERSATIONS AREN'T A GOOD THING? I LIKE TALKING TO MYSELF. INTRUDERS, WITHOUT THEM, EVERYONE IS JUST ALONE. EVEN WHEN THEY AREN'T FRIEND BUT FOE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DUMPING DOWN AT THE SINKHOLE. GET OUT PATROL A LITTLE BIT... SEE WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON. IN PICHER, IF ONLY THEY WERE REAL MAGGOTS, THEY'D BE EASIER TO CATCH, INSTEAD OF THE FLIES THAT BUZZ AWAY THE MOMENT CHEETO STARTS TO CLOSE IN. UNBELIEVABLE... YOU CAN SEE FROM ALL THESE TIRE TRACKS. SOMEBODY'S BEEN DUMPING ALL THE GARBAGE OUT HERE AND JUST SETTING IT ON FIRE. KINDA RUINS THE WHOLE AMBIANCE THING, DOESN'T IT? A LOT OF TIMES THEY'LL COME OUT HERE AND DUMP AND SET IT ON FIRE AND LEAVE. SO WHY DO YOU GO THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF SETTING IT ON FIRE? WELL, BECAUSE YOUR BILLS HAVE NAME AND ADDRESS ON IT AND YOU CAN BE TRACED... SO IF YOU BURN IT YOU CAN'T BE. CHECK THAT OUT, THAT'S A SINKHOLE. BLOWS MY MIND. IT CAVED IN. IT FALLS. BECAUSE WE DUG IT OUT. THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH. NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY AND LET'S JUST DUMP OUR GARBAGE IN IT. LOOK AT ALL THAT. TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO GO TO A DUMP AND DUMP IT. SO WE'LL JUST DRAG IT OUT HERE TO A PLACE AND WE'LL JUST DUMP THE CRAP. IF I FIGURE OUT WHO'S DUMPING THEN I'M GOING TO ASK 'EM WHY? WHY ARE YOU SO LAZY YOU CAN'T DO THE RIGHT THING? HELL'S THAT? HEY! IF I GET MY HANDS ON HIM. HE IS DAMN SURE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN HERE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BET THIS OLD BOY WAS GOING TO DUMP THAT ENTIRE DUMPSTER HERE? I GUARANTEE HE WAS GOING TO PULL IN HERE IF I HADN'T BEEN STANDING RIGHT HERE. I'M GOING TRY AND CATCH THESE SUCKERS. CHEETO IS RIDING THE WAVE OF HIS ANGER AND PAIN AGAIN, A DANGEROUS MAN, PERHAPS AS MUCH TO HIMSELF AS TO THE INTRUDERS. TIME WILL TELL... IT ALWAYS DOES.
