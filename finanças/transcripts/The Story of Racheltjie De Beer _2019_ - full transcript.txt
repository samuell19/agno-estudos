Back under the canopy, Jamie. You can sit with Frikkie. Keep an eye on your brother. (oxen lowing) (whip cracks) Come, Voliere. Come! - [Rachel] Jamie, down. - [Herman] Come on! Come on! (wheel thuds) (whip cracks) Let's go. (Rachel groans) - Hold on tight. (thrilling music) Jamie. Pa, help! Jamie fell into the water! - Jamie. Jamie. Jamie, breathe. Breathe! - Sage is for life. - He was your responsibility! Jamie, breathe. - Is Frikkie okay? - Jamie. - I'm sorry, Pa. (gun fires) (fire crackling) Come on. Let me pull out your tooth. - Mm-mm. - It's Jamie's bedtime. - [Rachel] Come, Jamie. - [Herman] Sleep well, you two. - [Rachel] Night, Pa. - [Jamie] Night, Frikkie. Rachel? - [Rachel] Yes? - What happens when I die? - [Rachel] When you die? You'll go to heaven. - But where is heaven? - Come. Lay down. Heaven's up there with the stars. - But I don't want to go to heaven. (Rachel chuckles) - Nothing's gonna happen to you, Jamie. - [Jamie] Tell me about Mama and the secret language of plants. - Shh, Jamie, talk softly. Papa mustn't hear us. - [Jamie] Please? - When I was your age, Mama told me about a language that everyone can hear, but a few people understand. It's the language plants speak. - What do the plants say? - Every plant says something different. Aloes tell a very sad story, proteas say, "Be brave," and white poppies whisper. Sleep. (thunder crackles) (Frikkie lows) - What are you looking at? Hm? (Herman grunts) (thunder crackles) (wind blowing) (ominous music) (gentle music) - [Marie] Remember me, Rachel? - Mama? (wind blowing) (ghostly whispering) (loud roaring) (Rachel gasps) (Rachel panting) - [Herman] Rachel! Rachel! I've been worried sick! - I'm drawing the mountains, Pa. - [Herman] Don't wander so far from the camp. There are leopards in these mountains. Get Jamie ready. We need to pack up. (baboon shouting) - [Rachel] Jamie, look. (Rachel shouting) (Jamie shouting) (gentle music) Pa, do you want some water? - [Herman] Pour sparingly. Thanks. (Herman sighs) Thanks. - Rachel, I want some more. - [Herman] No, no! Swarlen, come on now. - [Jacoba] George. George? - [George] People? - Strangers. My goodness, it's our Sara. - No, my love. Remember, Sara lives here with us. - Oh, is that so? (gentle music) - Remember our rules. Our business is our business. Come on now. Come on! (whip cracks) Come on. Come on! Come on, Swarlen. Come on! - [George] Good afternoon. - [Herman] Whoa. Whoa. Herman de Beer. - Welcome to Dearcloff. George Lundt. My wife Jacoba. And who do we have here? - I'm Rachel de Beer, sir. And this is my brother Jamie. - And this is Frikkie. - Please to meet you, Rachel and Jamie de Beer, and Frikkie. It's late in summer for a traveler in these parts. - [Herman] How come? - Well, the first cold front is nearly here. How can I help you? - We've been without water for days. And wagon's had it. Standard strap iron cracked. - You can stay there. It's cramped, roof leaks, but I'm sure you'll forgive me for that. - We're grateful for your hospitality. - [George] Lazarus will round up your oxen, take Frikkie. Join us for supper when you unpack. - Please, we can take care of ourselves. - Herman, please don't insult my generosity. And call me George. See you two later. - [Herman] Thank you, George. - Careful. Snake's head is for danger. - [Herman] Your room is next door. Please get Jamie ready for supper. (Jamie humming) - We must get ready for supper. Wear your clean clothes, Jamie. You can get them yourself. - Mm-mm. - Jacobus Johannes de Beer! - [Jamie] Uh-uh. (Jamie humming) - Watch it. - Good evening. - Good evening, ma'am. I'm Herman de Beer. - Sara Lundt. You must be Rachel and Jamie. - Please to meet you, ma'am. - Come inside. Your jacket, Mr. de Beer? - [Herman] Thank you. Good evening, George. Ma'am. - Good evening. How are the cattle? - Please, take a seat. - [Herman] Thank you. - Will you say grace? - [Herman] Lord, please bless. - Lord, please bless. - The food we eat. - [Jacoba] The food we eat. - May we never forget. - May we never forget. - [George] Amen. - Amen. - Salt, please, Sara. Thanks. So how long have you been on the road, Herman? - Almost three months. - That's a long time to be traveling alone with two children. Where's their mother? - They help where they can. - Surely makes more sense to join another party. Isn't that right, my love? - Yes, a big party has its benefits, but moves at a snail's pace. - Lazarus's people always say (speaking in foreign language). If you want to travel fast, travel alone. If you want to travel far, travel together. - What about school, for Rachel? - [Herman] She can catch up when we arrive in Witwatersrand at the end of May. - End of May? You can forget about that. It takes three weeks to cross this mountain range with a wagon, Herman. And you see, snow will be here in a week or two. And once it's fallen, no one crosses these mountains. - It's high summer. Since when is snow that predictable in this area? - When the orange river lily blooms white, she predicts heavy snow, Herman. And if her flowers and leaves wilt by the end of February, rain falls in the middle of March, like now. And then, in the last week, heavy snow. - Well, thank you very, very much. It's been really pleasant, but we must go home now. - [Sara] Mummy. Mummy? We are home. - [Jacoba] Oh. Oh, I see. - Been nearly 50 years on this farm. I've only seen the white lilies die before the end of February three times. Whoever heads into the snow, rarely makes it out alive. Ask Lazarus, if you don't believe me. - What are you going to do in Witwatersrand, Rachel? - Let me guess, goldmines? - [Rachel] That's right, sir. - [George] Every man with a dream and a shovel's headed there. - Fortunately, I don't have either. - [George] What do you mean? - I'm a blacksmith. I repair broken tools. - Which there are plenty on the goldmines. Bravo. (George chuckles) They'll be broken dreams too. How good are you at fixing them? - One first needs to know how to dream before one can acquire such skills, and I left that to artists and children years ago. - Spoken like a true pessimist. I'll drink to that, de Beer. Herman. - Thanks, George. - [Jacoba] Thank you, my child. - [Sara] Jamie? - [Rachel] Ma'am? - [Sara] Hm? - Do you know how many days there are until Easter? - Don't bother the lady with questions. - Good Friday is a week from Friday, so I would say 13 days. - [Herman] I think it's time for bed. All right. - Pleased to meet you. I'm Jacoba Lundt. - Sit down, my love. Have a seat. Finish your dessert and let Sara play the piano before we say goodnight. - Oh, Pa. Excuse me, Jamie. (gentle piano music) - Well, it's been a long day for you. - [Herman] Thank you for your hospitality, George. - I meant what I said earlier, Herman. You can stay here until the snow clears up. In exchange for food and lodging, you can help Lazarus fix the old stone kraal. Besides, it'll take you at least a week to repair your wagon. - [Herman] Come on, boy. - [George] Breakfast at first light. - Well, goodnight. What'd I tell you? - Our business is our business. - It has nothing to do with them or anyone else. Understood? Do you understand, Rachel? - Yes, Pa. (ominous music) (wind whistling) - [Marie] Remember me, Rachel. Drink. (blood drips) (goblet clunks) (Rachel gasps) Remember. (wind whistles) (birds squawking) (fly buzzing) - Come here, boy. Let me see. - [Jamie] Uh-uh. - [Rachel] He won't allow anyone near his tooth. - Be careful. If you swallow your tooth in your sleep, a whole mouthful of teeth will grow up in your stomach and eat all of your food. (George chuckles) - Yeah. (gentle music) - [Sara] Our family's been on Dearcloff for nearly 50 years. I was born on the farm. - [Herman] And you lived here ever since? - I was a teacher in town. But my parents need my help. - So we can call you Miss, ma'am? - [Sara] Miss Sara, yes. (chickens clucking) Morning, you lot. Come. Come. Come on. - Shh, shh. Got one. Come, Jamie. Come and pet him. Come here. Come and sit here. Don't be scared. If he pecks you, we'll have him for dinner. You pet him. Here, catch that one over there. I don't know, the black one. Careful. Catch him. Catch him. Come here, blackie. Quickly, catch him. - This is the kraal you must help Lazarus fix. My dad would have hired workers, but then you showed up. It's perfect timing. - [Herman] You tell that to the shovels and pickaxes on the goldfields waiting to be fixed. - [Jamie] Frikkie, keep still. - [Lazarus] He's a naughty calf. - [Rachel] Just like Jamie. - Frikkie doesn't have a mother, just like me, so I take care of him. (crickets chirping) (match sizzles) (door creaks) - Rachel? - [Jacoba] Little turkeys step like this, like that, like this, and like that. (gentle knocking) - [Sara] Mummy, I must go. (gentle knocking) - I need your help. (door creaks) - Hello. I brought you something. - My mother always plaited my hair for church. - May I ask, what happened to your mother, Rachel? (handle clicks) - [Herman] I'll walk you home. (Sara sighs) - [Jamie] Rachel, get up. - [Rachel] Leave me alone, Jamie. I want to sleep. - [Jamie] Let's go say hello to Frikkie. (Rachel groans) (gentle music) - [Rachel] Let me show you something Papa taught me when I was your age. - [Jamie] Ew. That's poop. - [Rachel] It's warm, isn't it? - [Jamie] Yeah. (Jamie chuckles) (Rachel chuckles) - [Rachel] Don't throw it at me. (Jamie chuckles) - [Jamie] Frikkie. Frikkie? Frikkie. Frikkie. Frikkie. Frikkie, where are you? (trees creaking) - [Rachel] Shh. (soft growling) - [Jamie] I'm scared. (leaves rustling) (loud growling) (Rachel groans) (leaves rustling) (Frikkie lows) - [Rachel] Stupid calf, what are you doing so far from the herd? Jamie, come look. - [Jamie] What? What's that? - Termite nests. - [Jamie] What are termites? - They're ants. (gentle music) Sage is for life. Nightshade is for death. Jamie?! Jamie. (ominous music) Jamie! Jamie! Jamie, get out of there. You can't just crawl into any hole. What if there was a snake? Do you know what this hole is? - [Jamie] Mm-mm. - It's an old Voortrekker oven. People baked bread in there. (gentle music) What's that? - [Sara] Licorice plant. It'll soothe the pain. Are you looking for something, Mother? - Remember to close the front door. - The front door is closed, Mummy. - [Jacoba] Listen, um... - It's me, Mother. Sara. - Why is Aunt Jacoba so confused, Miss Sara? - It's something that happens when one gets older. - I can't recall my mother's face. Sometimes, I dream about her, but I never see her face. - [Sara] Don't you have a portrait of her? - My father burned everything. I wasn't allowed to be at my mother's funeral. He wants us to forget her. - What was your mother's name? - Marie. - Marie. (gentle music) How did your mother die? - When Jamie was born, a great sadness came over her. My father said she died of sadness, but I don't believe him. She passed away on Good Friday. - That's next Friday. - We mustn't forget her, Miss Sara. - Come with me. Take a good look. Tell me, what did you get from your mother? - I have her nose or maybe her hair. - And Jamie? What did Jamie get from her? - Jamie has her eyes. - [Sara] Remember, wherever you and Jamie are together, your mother is there too. - [Rachel] Why aren't you married yet, Miss? You're so pretty. - I almost got married once. - [Rachel] To who? - His name is Kingsley. - Kingsley? - An Englishman. Let me show you something. He made me this to remember him by. - My mother told me that in the Middle Ages, they buried their loved ones by sending them off to sea in burning ships. - Sometimes, I wish I could send Kingsley to the ocean on a burning ship. (Sara chuckles) - Miss, Jamie and I want to commemorate Mama on Good Friday. I'd like it if you could come along. (crickets chirping) - [Sara] She's bleeding heavily and needs rest. My mother and I will look after Jamie. - Well, thank you for helping us with the children. - They are wonderful. - Thank you for not asking about their mother. - I'm sure they miss her. But that's none of my business. Goodnight. - [Herman] Sleep well, Sara. (gentle music) (horse whinnying) (horse galloping) (hammer thudding) (horse whinnying) - [George] Over my dead body. (George spits) - [Jacoba] Who is this one? - Voliere. - That's nice. And where is, um, Frikkie? - [Jamie] Frikkie's hiding somewhere among the poplar trees. - [Jacoba] Oh, those trees beyond the meadows where the big Voortrekker oven is? - [Jamie] Yes. - And what will you do with- (door clacks) - Jacoba, my love, you won't believe who's come to visit. - [Sara] Kingsley? - [Kingsley] Oh, aren't you a sight to behold. - [Sara] What are you doing? When did you return? - [Kingsley] Few weeks ago. - [Sara] You didn't let me know. - [Kingsley] You know this farm's in the middle of nowhere. Hello, sir. - Loft is ready for you. Sara will make up your bed. - [Kingsley] Thank you. Oh. Won't you introduce me? - Kingsley, Herman de Beer and his daughter Rachel. - [Kingsley] How long have you been working here, Herman? Lazarus has needed help for ages. Hello, Lazarus. - [Lazarus] Hello, Kingsley. - [Kingsley] You can leave it, Sara and I are going riding later. Will you please help with my rifle and saddlebags? Great. See you all in a bit. Come. Don't keep me waiting. - Cocky little... - Never heard pommy speak Afrikaans like that. (Rachel laughs) - [Kingsley] Tell me more about Herman de Beer and his children. - [Sara] There's nothing to tell. - [Kingsley] You were never good at lying, Sara. - [Sara] And you were never good at telling the truth. - [Kingsley] Oh, come on, I saw how uncomfortable you were when you had to introduce us to one another. - [Sara] There's nothing to tell. And yourself, have you not met a beautiful, young lady on your wild adventures who stopped you in your tracks? (Herman grunting) (gentle music) - [Rachel] Some water, Pa? - [Herman] Thank you. Sara and what's-his-name are back. Please fetch Jamie. - His name is Kingsley, Pa. - Just go and fetch Jamie. (hammer clanking) (steam hissing) - Well, it's time Jacoba and I went to bed. Leave it, Sara. I'll manage on my own. Come, my love. Goodnight, you two. - [Jacoba] Goodnight, my child. (crickets chirping) - There's something I want to tell you. I'm leaving for Argentina next month, for good. - I wish you all the best. - [Kingsley] Come with me, Sara. (Sara crying) - Must I leave my father alone with my mother on the farm? And after being gone for five years in Argentina, whereto then, Kingsley? If you cannot find your peace here, then you won't find it there either. - We both know a ship isn't built for the harbor, Sara, much less so for this Godforsaken farm. - Goodbye, Kingsley. - If you let me pull it out, it won't hurt any longer. Sit still, Jamie. - But it hurts. - [Rachel] What's on your tongue? - [Jamie] What is it? - [Rachel] Open your mouth so I can see! - [Jamie] No! - [Herman] What the hell's going on in there? Why aren't you two asleep? - Pa, she's trying to pull out my tooth. (Jamie grunts) (pillow thuds) - I've had enough of this damn tooth of yours! (Jamie groaning) Open your mouth, Jamie. Open your mouth! Hold still. (Herman grunts) (Jamie screams) Clean up your brother's mouth. All right, not another word from either of you tonight! You hear me? - [Rachel] Shh. Open your mouth. - But I don't wanna grow up without a tooth. - [Rachel] Jamie, that was just your baby tooth. Sometimes, you must lose something to get something better in its place. - This is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you. Greater love have no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth, I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends. May Rachel take communion? And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it and break it, and gave it to the disciples and said, "Take, eat, this is my body." And he took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink ye, all of it, for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins." (ominous music) (crickets chirping) - Jamie, wake up. It's time. Tonight, we commemorate our mother, and we say farewell. I have a surprise for you. This, this is what Mama looked like. You have her eyes. - [Jamie] Can I have it? - We're going to bury it. - [Sara] I have another idea. (leopard growling) (ominous music) - [Jamie] Mommy, this is my first tooth. - I remember the language you taught me when I was little, your smile. I remember you, Mama. - What the hell? What the hell are you doing out here? After I asked you not to do it, why are you doing it? You really wanna remember her, don't you? Very well, then. Let's remember her. For every memory you have, I'll give you one of mine. Do it now, all right? - I remember how she taught me to count with peas from the garden. - I remember how she disappeared for five days after your second birthday because motherhood was too much for her. More. - [Sara] Please stop. - [Herman] Another one! - I remember how she gave me biscuits to feed the squirrels that lived in the garden. - I remember her telling me the cuts on her arms were caused by rosebushes. I remember packed trunks, locked in her room for days on end, farewell letters. You really think that was her first suicide attempt? And that morning, where she lay in her own vomit, diarrhea, and blood, I remember thinking to myself, "Thank God. Now, I no longer have to worry about it happening. It has finally happened." - It's not true. Tell them it's not true. - It is. She ate a castor oil plant. Seeds, leaves, roots, and branches. She left me alone in this mess. - I'm sorry, Pa. - No, don't. Those words mean nothing to me, do you hear? Nothing! - You lied to me. - No. I protected you. You're just like your mother. No matter how hard I try to forget her, every time I see you, I see her. And you had no right. (wind blowing) - Rachel? What is suicide? - I'll tell you tomorrow. (ghostly whispering) (wind blows) - It's you. Go away! (wind blowing) Go away. (Herman grunts) Go away, Satan. Go away, Satan! Go away. Get away from me! (Herman grunts) (bottle crashes) Please, just leave me alone, just let me go! Let me go. Let me go. (Herman sobbing) Let me go. - [Sara] Morning. - Good morning, my child. - Strangest thing just happened. Herman came to say he's leaving this afternoon as soon as his wagon's ready. Man has lost his mind. The snow's upon us. (door clacks) (door thuds) Has everyone on this farm lost their minds this morning? - [Sara] What do you think you're doing? Listen to me. - Stay away! - Do you think you're the only one who's ever been hurt, the only one who's lost a great love? (hammer clanking) Herman, Herman, Herman, everything's always about Herman, isn't it? It's never occurred to you that your kids are hurting too? And while you destroy their memory of their mother, you're pushing them away! - I know what is good for my children. (Herman grunting) - And you say your wife was selfish. How dare you. (hammer clanking) (door clacks) (door thuds) (thunder crackles) (thunder rumbling) (whip cracking) - [Lazarus] Hyah! Go on! Go on. Come on, get going. - Frikkie's gone. - He's probably in the barn already. (oxen lowing) (thunder rumbling) (gentle knocking) - [George] What is it, Herman? - [Herman] I've come to fetch my children. - [George] Please be reasonable, Herman. The cold front is upon us. - Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Lundt. - You don't have to believe me. Ask Lazarus. - Jamie, come. (thunder crackles) Come, Rachel! (Jamie grunting) Hey! - Where's Frikkie? - Hey! - The little calf isn't with the other cattle. I'm going to look for him. - Leaving this afternoon. You can bring my oxen here, Lazarus. - Herman. The snow is here. - Then I'll do it myself! - My father and mother worked here on the farm. He and George had an argument and he decided to leave. The storm was already in the mountains. And George begged him, but my father was a proud mad and wouldn't stay a day longer. Jacoba found me in the vale under their frozen bodies. The cold did this to me. From that day, they no longer called me Matla, but Lazarus, the fortunate one who came back. - [Herman] Come. (thrilling music) Pack your things. - We're not going with you, Pa. - Stay if you want. Jamie's coming with me. Did you hear what I said, Jamie? Pack your things. - [Rachel] You heard what Lazarus said, Pa. - [Herman] We're leaving in an hour. (thunder crackles) (thunder rumbling) (thunder crackles) - Lazarus will find Frikkie. (window rattling) (wind blowing) (thunder crackling) - God, help us. (loud clattering) - Jamie, what are you up to? Jamie? (glass crashes) Jamie? (wind blowing) (window clatters) (Rachel grunts) Jamie's gone, Pa. - Don't lie to me. Where's Jamie? - He climbed out. The window was open. - [Herman] Shit. Goddammit. (wind blowing) (door clacks) Is Jamie here with you? - [Rachel] He's gone. - I couldn't find the calf anywhere. - I think he's looking for Frikkie. - [Herman] How much time do we have? - [Lazarus] None. - Sara, go light a few lanterns. Rachel, we need you to stay here in case he finds his way home himself. Keep the fire going and the house warm. Just make sure and stay nice and warm, people. We'll be back here in an hour. (thrilling music) Jamie? Jamie. - [Herman] Jamie! Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! - Jamie! - [Jacoba] Rachel? Rachel, come and look at this. - Jamie! (thrilling music) - [George] Jamie! Jamie! - Jamie! Jamie! (loud clattering) (gentle music) (thrilling music) - Pa! Mr. George! Lazarus! Miss Sara! Mrs. Jacoba, if my father comes looking for me, tell him I went to fetch Jamie at the termite nests, in the forest next to the meadows. Do you understand me? - Anthills. Oven. Mm. - Okay. - [Jacoba] Okay. (door clacks) (door thuds) (thunder crackles) (winds blowing) - [Herman] Jamie! Jamie! (Herman groaning) - Jamie! (thunder crackling) - Jamie. Jamie! Miss Sara?! - Jamie! (thrilling music) - [Rachel] Miss Sara! (thunder crackles) (Rachel groans) (Herman grunting) - [Lazarus] Jamie! - [Rachel] Jamie! Jamie? Jamie! - [Jamie] Rachel. Rachel. - [Rachel] Jamie! Jamie? - Rachel. - [Rachel] Jamie. We've been looking everywhere for you. - [Jamie] I couldn't find Frikkie. - [Rachel] Come on, let's go home. (gentle music) Climb on. - [Sara] Why is the fire dead? Mother? Rachel? Mother? Where's Rachel? - Who? - [Sara] Rachel? - Rachel? Rachel. (winds blowing) - [Rachel] I think the house is this way. I need to rest a bit. - When's Pa coming to get us? - [Rachel] He's on his way. (door clacks) - [George] Come and sit by the fire, Lazarus. (winds blowing) - Ant. Ants. - Rachel went looking for Jamie. - Ants. Ants. Ants. - Mother, what are you trying to tell us? - [Jacoba] Ants. - Mother! - [Jacoba] Ants. (winds blowing) - [Rachel] We must keep moving. (fire crackling) - Lazarus! Please keep an eye on the fire! Make sure it doesn't go out! - [Lazarus] Yes, ma'am! (thunder crackles) (ominous music) - [Rachel] We're going in circles. What are we gonna do? We must sleep in the oven. - [Herman] Rachel! Jamie! - [Rachel] Eat this, Jamie. Sage will give you strength. - I'm cold. - Do you know what I used to do to get you to sleep when you were a baby? You always cried when you were with Mama. (gentle music) Nobody knew how to get you to sleep. Then one night when it was too cold to rock you to sleep, I stole you out of that room and brought you in my bed. You slept through the whole night. - [Herman] Rachel! - Rachel! - [Herman] Rachel! Rachel! - Mama. (footsteps treading) (gentle music) I remember you, Mama. Jamie, it's important that you listen to me now. I'm about to fall asleep. And if you wake up before me, I want you to tell Papa something. Tell him he must remember. - [Jamie] Rachel? - Yes, Jamie? - Will you sing me to sleep? (Rachel humming) I'm cold. - Ants. Ants. (Rachel humming) (birds chirping) (footsteps rustling) (leopard growls) - Rachel. Ants. Ants. (gentle music) - [Sara] Rachel! Rachel. - [Herman] Racheltjie, where are your clothes? - [Sara] Come. - Wake up. Please wake up. Please wake up. Just wake up. (Herman crying) Please wake up. Please wake up. - [Sara] Herman. Herman, Jamie. - [Jamie] Rachel? - [Sara] Jamie, come here. - [Herman] Jamie, come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. (gentle music) (Herman crying) Come. Come. - Go. Go. Go. I'm so sorry. - [Jamie] Pa, Rachel said you must remember. (gentle piano music) (gentle music)
