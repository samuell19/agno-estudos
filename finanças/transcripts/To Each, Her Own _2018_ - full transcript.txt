- You OK? - Here she is! With her new haircut! Come and join us. We won't be long. Happy anniversary to you Happy anniversary to you Happy anniversary Claire and Simone Happy anniversary to you! I'm so proud of you, little sis. We love you! Who's blowing out the candles to celebrate your three years together? - You do it, honey. - Me? Hang on, hang on! If I blow out all three at once, I promise I'll come out. Take it out, or it will be really dry. You don't eat kosher, so spare me your advice! Mom, about the wedding... The heat's escaping! I'd like to bring someone. Careful with Dad's china! It was a wedding gift... Yes, I know, I know! From Grandpa to your mom even though they were homeless... - Grandma didn't have much at your age! - It's 8 p.m. You're an hour late! - OK. Hurry up. - We're not waiting! - Your brother's a pain! - We're not waiting. It needs something. Try it, honey. - You forgot the cumin. - Why come if it's to criticize me? I've come to make you happy! Me and Jewish holidays... You're still Jewish though! You think the Nazis asked if you were a practicing Jew? Leave the terfas alone, there'll be none left! - Nice! - There's plenty. We only ate a little bit. - To stop the mice. - They're in your head! Sure! I'm going gaga. Gaga. You're non-practicing, fine. Apart from Mom, the family was deported. Eating salami didn't stop any of them from getting deported. If you're going to die for being a Jew, you may as well actually be one. No way! If you're going to die, you might as well indulge. - See you next week, Mrs. Noëlle. - Thank you, Maryse. Happy New Year. Mom, it's cold! I'm just airing the room. That Maryse... - How can you be so racist? - I'm not being racist, I love Maryse. You smelled like a wet cat as a child. Hasn't your boyfriend told you? If you'll give me a minute, I wanted to talk to you. Is he married? Is he an Arab? What would you say if he was? - You're impossible! - What should we do? I don't know. You decide for once. I'm sick of this! The prodigal son's always late. Let's start without them. Call him, please. No! I'll just get mad at him. No. He's your son, Dad. Where are you? On the beltway? I see. Right, OK, OK. A garbage truck's in the way. On the beltway? I'm sick of these holidays! I bust a gut and no one cares! I can't ever do anything right. I'm crap, crap, crap! I might as well die! - Hello, we're here! - Hello! Sorry, the traffic was terrible. - Shana Tova! - Hello. Shana Tova, Dad. All right? - We've got some good news. - Yeah? We've found a chateau for our wedding. - Mazel tov. - Are you bringing someone? - I said I was. - Who? I knew it! Why hide the fact you've met someone? I'm bringing Claire. - Who's Claire? - Just her roommate. Yes, but she's also my... She's my... She's my best friend. Simone, I can fix you up with a guy on my site anytime. They're all great Jews with good jobs, not guys who sign up for sex. Moroccan Jews, Tunisian Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, even Chinese Jews. - He's right, you can't stay single. - She has plenty of time! No, she doesn't. At her age, I already had two sons. - Anyone care who I'm bringing? - Don't start! I can't bring my civil partner to my own brother's wedding? Homosexuality is a disease. - The Torah forbids it! - Why not meet him? Don't upset your father. We don't want the family to know. Can't you understand that? OK, everyone calm down. - We'll think about it. - About what? He isn't coming! - Then neither am I. - Here we go! We're bad parents, we messed up, I'm a bad mom, and I'm crap, crap, crap! Well, how did it go? I'm crap. Mom went on about Auschwitz again then slapped herself loads... - Just tell them when you're ready. - I am ready! They're the problem, not me. Dad almost passed out. With two gay kids, he'll have a heart attack. It's really getting to me, it's... I won't be OK till I tell them. I'm not OK. And I want you to meet them. You brought us matzot? - Wasn't it New Year? - They had some left over. I've got a gift for you too. - What? - Wait and see! - Is it what I think? - I don't know! Thanks. Thank you. Benloulou! It's 9:20 a.m. Don't feel bad, renting's much better. If you split up, it will be less hassle. And buying in La Varenne... I grew up there. It's nice, it's pretty, but you'll die of boredom. - Don't worry. Thank you. See you soon. - Goodbye. - Do you have my number? - Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Hey! - I told you not to come here again. Help me, Simone. The tax man's after me. I'm busy. - Please! - Your site's sending me spam. - Spam? I registered you. - What? Sure. Don't touch! Stop that. Did Mom ask you to register me? No, she didn't. We don't have any decent girls. I've set you up with Keren's cousin. You'll like him. Éric Taieb. He works in finance. - You had no right! - Want to end up an old maid? No way will I meet him! Hang on. Look... Look at that handsome guy. Plus he's got a great job. You'll be happy. - Sorry, I... - No, no. Stay. I was leaving. OK. Don't let me down. - I almost forgot... - Keep your mezuzah! I don't want the neighbors to think I'm a Lubavitch! - Ashamed? - David, I don't live alone. God hasn't forgotten you. Go away. Go, now. - I'll come by and put it up. - Leave. - Goodbye. - Bye. How the fuck do I unsubscribe? - What is it? - Just look, it's... - Help! - Who's that cute guy? Let's go eat. Three-spice roast cod and glazed vegetables. - Thank you. - Enjoy, girls! This is... This is incredible, right? - All right? - Hey. - Well? - Delicious! The star anise is a great find. - There's something... - What? ...unfamiliar. Is it new? Here's a clue: Senegalese spice. Sumbala? Well done! I'm impressed. - Was it a bad idea? - No, no... It's really amazing, but... OK, it's just not quite as good as the whiting filet you made last Monday. You're right. I'm not on form, my mom's hassling me. Wali, two steaks for table two! I'm doing a Senegalese buffet tonight. A buffet? Yes. Come along. - OK. - See you there. Sure! The night is ours, girl! - Glad you could make it! - You made all this? Sure! I was inspired by traditional Senegalese dishes. This is an asparagus and hibiscus cream. My take on maffe. Tell me what you think. It's... I'm speechless, it's that good! - Not too hot? - It's perfect. This is a bit more traditional, but if you like chilies... OK? Careful, it has a kick. Hello? No, I told you I'm busy this week! Just tell them I don't know when I'll be able to make it. Say it was a misunderstanding. Look, I have to go. - Your mom? - Almost. My aunt. She wants to marry me off. Same here. This is good! I never imagined you like this. Like what? You're usually so serious. It's the chili! Come back to mine. I think I'd better go! Hey, Simone! - Stay! - No. I have to go. Taxi! You're weird. Did you take something? - It stings! - That's the chili. Hey. Oh, baby... What's this? Did you do something wrong? Thanks. - He was gorgeous! - I don't know, I didn't... - I can't do this. - What? - I can't. - Hang on! It isn't the end of the world. All you did was kiss. Say you're in a relationship. End of story! It isn't that simple. - Hey, do you like him? - I was drunk. You do like him! In fact, you're a little bi. Bi? I slept with a guy when I was 18. He was my first and last. I'd know if I was bi! - So we can't eat there? - Go without me. I don't want to. You're a pain! It's the only good spot. - Where to then? - The bakery. Hello? - Hey! - Yes? Don't forget your date with Éric Taieb tonight. - Keren's cousin. - Tonight? I can't tonight. I've got something important... with Géraldine, my coworker. What? Cancel it! You see her every day. I can't cancel. It's... her birthday. Don't do this to me three weeks before my wedding! Éric's invested in my site. I never asked for anything! You set me up. Hello? I can't hear you. You're breaking up. Bye, don't let me down! He's taking the piss. - I know! - What? Why don't you go instead? Say you're Simone. You'll be wined and dined. - No way! - Come on! A fundamentalist! I'll end up with a headscarf. Come on, please! You said he was really cute. He is cute, but blind dates never work out. - Besides, I'm not Jewish. - Eating kosher is simple! Don't have any pork, game, shellfish or horsemeat. - Only cloven hooves, fins and scales. - What? Forget it. Look, for dinner just have something simple, like beef or sea bream. But if you have meat, no dessert. It's bound to contain cream. We're not allowed. "Do not boil a kid in its mother's milk" Hang on, I'm totally lost. You know what? Just mess up the date. My folks will stop trying to marry me off. Hang on, what was it again? No pork, no seafood, no game and no horsemeat? Yes. Have fun and make sure he pays for dinner. OK. You'll be fine. Éric? Simone? Have you decided? I'll have rib steak with maître d'hôtel sauce please. Certainly. Don't you eat kosher? What? Well, yes. Rib steak is beef. It isn't pork rib steak, is it? Of course not, but... You cook it in butter, right? Yes, butter and parsley. Of course! It isn't important. I constantly break the rules. I'll have fish instead. Do you have sea bream? No, sorry, madam. Might I suggest the sole meunière with stir-fried vegetables? Yes. That's perfect. But don't forget to remove the scales and fins. I'll have the same. It's perfect. - Girls! - When you're no spring chicken... Girls! Right, I've got... something really important to say to you, Claire. - We're in the way! - No, not at all. In fact, it's... It's... essential that you're all here. Right, I... I... I've thought a lot about the bond between us, how important you are to me... You're the love of my life. Will you marry me, Claire? What about your folks? My folks? My parents don't get any choice in the matter. They did exactly the same thing. My grandma... She'd stand in the street and shout, "Let me die here!" She didn't want my mom to marry a Sephardi. Of course when David was born, they all made up. Hang on! Don't tell me you're having a kid too. The lot of you are going on about weddings and babies. - So? - You sound like straights. You're reactionary. - What a generation! - That's life, Joss. - Will you? - Of course! You said yes. I've something important to say. Right... I love someone... - And... - I knew it! That makes us so happy. Mothers sense these things. Listen to her, the clairvoyant! Your brother told us. - Nathaniel? - No. David. Love at first sight, like Dad and I? Yes. I mean no. It's more than that. But are these dating sites serious? - Who are these men? - He's Keren's cousin! - What? - You know what? They're moving too fast. Stop worrying. Éric's a responsible boy, isn't he? - He gave you his phone numbers... - Éric? - No, no, no... It isn't what you think. - He drove you home in his Jag. Can he drive? Obviously! He takes his mom to play Scrabble every Wednesday. He'd better not mess you around. Come here, honey. I'm crap, crap, crap! Hey, Simone, stop that! I'll never manage it. Ever! Just forget it. It isn't important, OK? When we have a baby, your mom will shower him with Hanukkah gifts. No! I'm not having my folks force their religion on him. All right. But he'll be allowed to a bit of yoga, a bit of meditation. A little namaste, a sun salutation, huh? We'll see. So you didn't manage to tell your folks. To make up for that, you can tell Wali. - That won't help. - Yes, it will. No. Vis-à-vis Claire, it makes no difference. Yes, but you... You'll feel better about things. That way, we can go back to the restaurant. Bit risqué for an Orthodox. No! He has a Jag. Could you tighten this? You should see him! He's so smart. And his eyes... It's as if he can read my every thought. And his smell! He smells so good. I wonder which aftershave... Hey, I think it's his natural musk! We like the same things. He listens to 90s R&B too. He loves old movies... He's seen Titanic three times, just like me. Wild, right? The only problem is... I haven't told him I'm not you. Don't! Don't say a word. - Really? - No, not for now. - Fuck! - Ooh, hang on. You have to run it under a cold tap immediately. You OK? Perfect timing! Try this. I don't eat pork. Actually, Wali... About the other night... What are you? Benloulou's North African, huh? Er, yes, er, no... I'm nothing special really. - But the thing is... - Here, try this. I've been lost without you. Where were you? It melts in your mouth, it's amazing, it's... - You should open a restaurant. - Funny you say that. I'd really like to, but when you're black, the banks don't trust you. Come see me, I might be able to help you. We could be partners. You mean open a restaurant together? Sure. Why not? Actually, when you try the pork, do what you do with wine. Taste then spit it out. - What? - Like with wine, to not get drunk. You swill it around your mouth. As far as your religion goes, you've broken no rules. - You're a funny girl. - You drink though. I do. So do you. Talk about a capacity for alcohol! You're funny when you're drunk. Sensual too. There's something I haven't told you. I haven't told you... I'm with someone. Ah, OK. I thought you'd come back for my beautiful eyes. Hey! Are you OK? Yes. I need to lie down. Oh dear! You're coming down with something. What's wrong? Simone? Is it something I said? Tell me. I did something really dumb. You broke the worm bin? Is that it? It doesn't matter. Darling, it's no big deal. Don't worry about it. Come on... It's Wali. Who's she? He's a Senegalese cook. What? What happened? Did he jump you? Did he grab you? Hey, Simone? I'm calling the cops! - No, don't do that. - Why not? It isn't what you think. It wasn't just him. Get out, please. Get out. Claire... Just get out of here! Get lost! Claire! - Let's talk. - What for? Please forgive me. - I don't want to lose you. - Who the hell are you? You propose then screw a guy! You've got a nerve. Exactly! A guy! It doesn't count. I'll tell him about you, that I can't live without you. You know what? I've been living with a stranger. You're not gay, you're a fucking closet het! How dare you! My first kiss was with a girl. I was a lesbian at 11. Marion Faivre... I was mad about her. What's a real lesbian anyway? One who's never slept with guys? So being non-practicing means I'm not Jewish? I'd have been deported! Have you any idea how dumb you sound? Claire! Wait! Wait! Where's Wali? He'll be here soon. Are those for me? Listen, forget about what happened yesterday. It was a mistake. - What? I'm lost. - What I didn't tell you is... My guy's a girl. I'm lesbian. What? That's a new one! I'm serious. No. I've slept with lots of girls. You know, married women, ones with kids, right-wingers, but never a lesbian. - Seriously? - Don't argue! I'm not into guys. Not guys, me! I like women, OK? Fuck me! When I tell the guys, it'll blow them away. I won't tell everyone though. Some will freak out. Don't take that badly. I'm just saying... In Senegal, it's bad luck. In Senegal, Simone! Benloulou! It's 10:20 a.m. Hello. Do you remember me? Moussa, Wali's cousin. You said I could come by. Yes, of course. Fuck! Hey, it's money coming in! Just a moment... Unsubscribe me from your site! But you've got loads of offers! Not that it matters. I hear you hit it off with Éric Taieb. - Sorry. - I can come back. No, it's fine. - Hello? - Tell me everything! - No! I'm working. - You're always working! You never tell me anything. Is he kind, handsome? What did you eat? What did we eat? We had... - Senegalese. - Senegalese? - I thought you went to the Londore. - If you know, why ask? Mom, right? Claire, we need to talk. I screwed up, I know I screwed up. I know you think I betrayed you, that I betrayed you all because it was a guy. I couldn't care less about him. I've got rid of him. It's you who I love. Look at me, Claire! Get her to shut up. Tell her to go. I don't want to see or hear her. Claire, please, I love you! - Get lost! - Hey, I live here! - She doesn't want you here. - Leave her alone! - This isn't your home anymore! - She doesn't want you here. - Simone... - Back off! Come back later. She can't talk right now. Claire... I love you! Just calm down. It's OK. You love each other. You have a great relationship, but this is a bad time. - Can you tell her I love her? - I will, I promise. Off you go now. She needs to be alone, Simone. I don't understand why all you girls get into such a state. Why the hell be gay if it's to behave like some boring straight couple? When I met Julia, I was married. I brought her home. We were a ménage à trois. Then I met Clélia. I took off with her. And Julia and my guy... Guess what they did! Got married and had a kid. For years after, they were mad at me. So never again! No way. When you've loved, you can't suddenly hate. What did you do wrong anyway? You liked a guy and you screwed him, great! I've ruined everything. - My life is such a mess! - Oh, honey! Hang on a sec... Come on. Besides, listen... I'm sure it isn't over between Claire and you. She really cares about you. She'll forget about it in time. Get off! What are you doing? Hey, relax! - You were giving me signs. - Signs? It would do you good though, help you unwind. I need to sleep. OK, then. If you need anything, you know where I am. Benloulou! It's the end of the day. Time to wake up. Sure? Call me if you feel down. Can we talk? Sorry for acting like a jerk yesterday. It's just you don't look like one. Oh no? But I don't wear make-up. I never wear dresses, I watch the Ellen Show and I have a signed poster of Amélie Mauresmo. I'm really sorry. But, I mean... Ever slept with a guy before? No. I was a virgin. I'd never have imagined you didn't like guys. - Where are you going? - The Ritz. I booked a room. She kicked you out, huh? That usually happens to men. I'm not saying you're a guy. How about staying at mine? The Ritz is so overrated, whereas my place is a luxury pad. I'm not sure it's a good idea. No ulterior motives, OK? You're a lesbian. Promise I won't touch you. No. I won't touch you. Let's say it's a test to see if we can be pals and open a restaurant. Because I can't stop thinking about it. There's an old garage for sale. - Where? - Near the station. After you. Welcome to my pad. This is the living room, with your sofa bed. It's really quiet. You can hear the birds singing. See those buildings? It's the project we drove through. I lived there when I got here, at my aunt's. Then I bought this. You stayed local. I love it here. I've got my cousins, my buddies. The nerve center of my apartment... - The kitchen. - Wow! It looks great. It's kind of small but I can cook up a storm. And in the morning... I love having my coffee here. The sun hits the table. I sit down, close my eyes... It feels like Marseille. All that's missing is the sea. Sometimes I feel so good, I can actually hear it. - You're from Marseille? - Yes, my accent's a giveaway! Didn't I say I came here to study? Hey Simone, my savior! - What a surprise! - OK? - Meet Babakar, my cousin and neighbor. - How you hanging? And Ousmane, who's here from Dakar for a few months. Hello, miss. I'm putting her up. She's homeless. - Yeah, sure! - Where are you sleeping? - I'll leave her with you. I'll go cook. - Sure! We'll take care of her! I'm setting up a business. The bank won't help. What kind of business? Stay out of this! It ain't your problem, bro. He's always setting up a business! Oh yeah? Shut your mouth, you! - Wasn't that the door? - Wali! Do you smoke? - Is it strong? - No, it's fine. Homegrown. OK, big bros? - OK, guys? - Here, welcome! - That from back home? - Thanks. - Just got here? - Yeah, this morning. Hey, you're new! - What's your name? - Simone. Simone. So how did you pick Wali up? I didn't, we're buddies. You must have a very talented marabout. Because to get him... you got to have huge tits! Guys, let's go out tonight. Sure! I heard Titan's is good. No way! It's full of Senegalese girls. French girls have no respect. It ain't like back home. They don't treat men right. But I'm sure you treat them right, Simone. I'll go see if Wali needs a hand. That's how you scare girls away! Hey, Simone! Stay with us. Come sit down. You embarrassed her! - Need a hand? - No thanks. - Sure I'm not in the way? - No. Can you take this? Sure. It looks beautiful. We're starving, we're starving! Wali rocks! - Great! - What is that? - Antipasti. It's Italian. - Looks iffy. Try it first. With spicy sauce. Listen to this, guys. Jewish schools and synagogues are under police protection again. - They get it all! - Sure, because they're loaded. They're all over the TV: Drucker, Arthur, Hanouna... Right, Simone? They help each other out. We can speak freely. They're everywhere! Hey, you lot! Bunch of slackers, taking drugs again! What are you doing here? I'll box your ears for you! Go home, now! - Ah, Wali, honey, there you are. - You OK? You OK? This is Simone. How do you do, Simone? - Simone... - Benloulou. Simone Benloulou. I need to have a word. Wali, you're a handsome boy but it's time you settled down. Stop that! Wait till you meet the Sankaré girl. See how lovely she is. I didn't promise anything, it was my uncle's idea. Wali, arranged marriages make the world go round. Right, come on, druggies! Folk with nothing better to do. - You're getting married? - Are you kidding? An arranged marriage? No way. Do you need a hand? Fries with osso buco? Yep... If I don't make fries, they'll go to McDonald's. - So you peel potatoes for everyone. - Family is family. - You should cut the cord. - Why? I like cooking for my cousins, I like being with them. Family is like a millstone. You need to open a restaurant now. Or in 20 years, you'll still be peeling potatoes. Listen to them laughing. A millstone? Anyway they're our future regulars. Not to mention their pals, their pals' pals, their cousins... Sorry... - Hello? - It's me, I'm right outside. - What? - With the mezuzah. - I brought my tools. - No, I'm not home. - When will you be home? - David, not now, go home. But I brought my tools. I might not be free after today. - Is your roommate in? - David, you're a pain! To hell with your mezuzah! I'll put it up when I feel like it. - You can't, it needs a special prayer. - Screw your prayer, I'm not religious! I only celebrate Shabbat to please Dad so give me a fucking break! You're a Jew? Why? I asked if you're a Jew. Yeah... Well, I was born Jewish. I'm not a practicing Jew. I don't eat kosher. I eat pork. - I love pork. - You're ashamed. That's worse. No, I'm not ashamed. I go to my parents' for Shabbat. I celebrate all the festivals. It's who I am. Give her a break. - Shut it, you hick fuck. - What was that? Hey, cool it! Hello? Your roommate's in, I'll go fix up the mezuzah. No, David, stay there, I'm coming... Wait for me. See you in a minute. Get out, both of you! - Traitor! - Wali! - You didn't say you were Jewish. - You didn't ask. - I asked if you ate pork. - That's different. - You think I'm anti-Semitic? - For fuck's sake... - Well, do you? - I'd say your cousins are! - You might have told me. - Well, now you know! Were you with Éric Taieb? Did she tell you? I fixed her up with my fiancée's cousin Éric, through my website. - They've really hit it off! - Where's the mezuzah? I gave it to you. Your wife is black? Excuse me? No... Are you single? You should try my website. Stop it, David, she isn't Jewish. Ah, I see. Shame, a beautiful woman like you... If you're interested, I have contacts. Conversion usually takes eight years. - But I can fix it so it only takes two. - Here. Thanks. Nice place you have here. I like it. Only one bedroom? Yes. That way, when we feel lonely, we can have a cuddle. Yeah, cuddles are important. Actually, we wanted a big living room, so we take turns. First Simone, then me, then Simone, then me... I see! - Simone never tells us anything. - OK. David... I'm dying of thirst. May I? That was good. It's delicious! Wow! Vegetable juice? You can taste the forest. A slight earthy taste, moss... I love Japanese cuisine. You have to kiss the mezuzah. No, with your hand. Sorry. Simone? There! Now that wasn't difficult, was it? - Nice to meet you, Claire. - Likewise. And if you'd like to come to my wedding... - Bring a date. - Thanks, David. - See you soon. - Bye. First Wali, now Patrick... How many more? - Éric. - Whatever. - I don't even know him. - David thinks you do. It's Keren's cousin, David fixed up a date... I'd rather not know! You cower like a little girl in front of your brother. But I made two people happy. Simone... You're not keeping it. What are you doing? Honestly! It won't budge, I can't get if off! Wait, let me help. How did he do that? He's so religious! Come on... Amazing that your brother never noticed anything. He doesn't get it. You only see what you want to see, right? Right. Can I stay over? Simone... I didn't want to make trouble for you with your brother but... I'm not ready for this. - Hi. - Hey. - OK? - Yeah. Give me your bag. Thanks, it's really nice of you. Couldn't your boyfriend put you up? - Who told you? - You fell out with Claire, I didn't. No. OK, first of all, he isn't my boyfriend. Plus he lives in Aubervilliers with a bunch of guys. - 50 illegal immigrants in 2 rooms? - What's with the dumb cliché. All clichés contain a hint of truth. Not everyone has a huge downtown apartment. You're so naive! Remember Amedy Coulibaly? Fofana, the Gang of Barbarians? It isn't just Dieudonné! They're all hard-line anti-Semites! You're like Mom and Dad, seeing anti-Semites everywhere. - What you did to Claire was shitty. - You're pissing me off! Who says me and Claire are through? This guy means nothing to me. - You've never strayed? - Have you two quite finished? - Hi, Simone. - Hi. - What about our baby? - What baby? So that's what's bothering you. Things go belly up and you blame her. - It's really weird anyway. - What's weird about it? Claire gets my sperm, Simone gets yours. - Everyone does it. - Claire changed her mind. - She wants black kids now? - Cut it out, Nath. Can't I joke about it? So what now? I want to be a dad. - I don't know. We'll adopt. - No way, I want my son to be Jewish. You're worse than a Lubavitch! "Your" son will be my son too. And may be called Samantha. That's a fucking stupid name. I told you, if it's a girl, I want to call her Samantha. Samuel for a boy, Samantha for a girl. Either way, Sam's the name. I remember telling you in Dublin. - Want to make a scene? - No! - It's a lousy name. - Samantha's a nice name! I don't want a daughter called Samantha! - Samantha, Samuel... - Don't make a scene! - Why not? - I disagree, so let it go! Do you often fall out with Nath? Yeah, the occasional outburst adds a bit of spice. Makes the reconciliations better, if you get my drift. Don't you mind that my dad refuses to see you? Sure I do, it's heavy. Every family celebration, I get to stay home alone. It's awful. But we can't be straight to please your parents. - Ready? - Ready. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Hi, I'd like to see Simone Benloulou. Wait over there, she won't be long. - Sir? - I'm here to see Miss Benloulou too. - To open an account. - Wait over there, please. - For Simone Benloulou? - That's right. - Me too. - I got here first. Miss Benloulou? Benloulou, what the hell's going on? I don't know, they want to open an account. If they're blacklisted like your friend Moussa, they can't open one. Miss Benloulou? - Yousef Mounda! - Come with me. - Hi there. - Hi. - Am I disturbing? - No, come in. It's no big deal, but Moussa needs to stop sending me clients or he'll get me sacked. Great! Once you're fired, we can open our restaurant. Super trendy cuisine. Afro-Judeo-French. We'll clean up! The "Jerusalem of Africa." No, the "Zion of Paris." No, I know... "Tastes & Colors!" Awesome. Got time for a drink? No. I mean... - Not really. - Just a drink. - A quick one. - Quickly, then. I'd go for a tapas-style thing. Something you share. Kind of neo-bistro... Hold it right there. I want Michelin stars. Chef's hat, a sommelier, all that. Then you need to rise through the ranks: apprentice, cook, sous-chef... Not any more. Good cooks get stars. Simple. Anyway I did all that at catering school. You're right to be ambitious. Only one thing. A good restaurant has to serve pork. You do the tasting. Of course I will, but so must you. A great chef has to taste his food. Otherwise, he's not a great chef. I know! Oh my God.. No... Oh yes, you have to. Temptation at its rawest. Your first time? Come on... Don't be afraid. Think of our restaurant. Aren't you tempted... by new experiences? A slice of forbidden pleasure? God isn't going to strike you down. - If my mother could see me... - She can't. A new world is opening up to you. It's delicious. Fuck! You're my new world. Wali, don't! Stop it! - Put me down! We're friends! - I know, can't you see that? I can't just give in to my desires. - Why not? - My head's too fucked up! - Who's that? - My brother and his boyfriend. - Are your parents gay too? - Yeah, both of them. I'm kidding, they're mega reactionary. Good! You want to sleep here? - With honorable intent? - As friends. Remember, we have to pass the test. Nathaniel? Kevin? Anyone there? - What are you doing here? - What about you? Claire's cousins turned up with nowhere to stay, so... - Where are Nathaniel and Kevin? - In Russia. Emergency crew stand-ins. - So how come you're here? - They missed Yiddish singing class. What? Yiddish? Since when? How come I didn't know. I never see you, we never talk. You never talk! So what's going on? You see Nathaniel and Kevin behind Dad's back? For singing. Your brother tells me stuff. How come you invited Nath and not me? So come! I don't want to sing Yiddish. See? You might have asked though, so I could refuse! I know, I'm a lousy mother. I'm crap, crap, crap... Someone here? - Somebody's here. - No. Can you see anyone? No. It's the neighbors. Is it Éric Taieb? Let me see him! Mom! Don't be so nosey. This is my private life. - Private life, at your brother's! - No way. He's naked. Naked? I'll leave you to it, then! I'm so happy for you! You'll tell me all about it, right? Yes, Mom! - Ah, come in, my dear. - Hi. This is my daughter Simone. Keren's parents. - Hi. - Hello. We're so happy to meet you. Éric has told us so much about you. So have you two hit it off? We're all so happy. You didn't hear it from me, but he kept landing himself with goys! I see. You work in finance, right? Yes, I... She's very highly regarded. A promotion beckons! She'll soon be the youngest bank manager in France. - Dad... - But it's true! We're very proud. Excuse me. Hello? Wali? Wali, can you hear me? Yes. That's great news. OK. I'll call you back. Yoo-hoo, it's us! Mom, Dad, I have a surprise for you. Éric Taieb! Éric! Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet you. Simone's told us so much about you. - Is Simone here? - She's on the phone. Hey, go find her and surprise her! - It's fine. - She'll be delighted, go on! - Go on. - Yes, go on! Down the hall. Good evening. Good evening. Sorry... I'm Éric, Keren's cousin. Géraldine, a cousin too. OK. Have you seen Simone? Simone? No. So, are you pleased? Nice surprise, right? Come on, they're waiting for us. Everyone's here, we can eat now. But... weren't we waiting for Simone? Simone's here. No. Sorry... aren't you cousin Géraldine? No. My daughter, Simone Benloulou, young man. Of course she is. What's... This is Simone. But you aren't the Simone I met. I'm so sorry. About what? - So who was the girl I met? - I can explain. What's going on? OK... The evening we were meant to meet I was really tied up, so I asked my colleague Géraldine Da Costa to go in my place. We had no idea... You'd hit it off, so... - I think I might faint. - Wait? Is your friend Jewish? - Da Costa is a Portuguese name. - You're killing my website! So she's just been lying to me? - You've been lying to us? - No way! But why? I did it to stop you bugging me about arranged marriages! I couldn't make it, because I was meeting Claire. - I had to ask her something. - Who's Claire? - Her roommate. - No, not my roommate! She's... ..my girlfriend. - What? - She's my girlfriend. My lover, my girlfriend. We've been together three years. I wasn't free that night because I asked her to marry me. Marry you! Is that possible? Sure, it has been for years. - Actually, Kevin and I... - All right! You live with a woman? It's complicated at the moment. We may split up. No, Norbert, don't faint. They're going to split up... Now then... Mr. Benloulou... What is it this time? The kids? Taxes? - My daughter. I want to see her. - Of course. Your father's asking for you. Don't worry, it's just another fainting attack. That pervert! She's manipulated you, corrupted you. Sorry, Dad, I didn't want to hurt you. The goal in life... is to have children. To have descendants. It's how you find happiness. Without children, you're alive... but it's like being dead. Dad, I want children. But how, without a man? There are lots of ways. You can adopt, or use a donor. A donor? To give what? Sperm. You want to kill me? Help! Dad's dying! Claire, it's me. I'd like to see you. I've talked to my parents. My dad is in hospital. It's weird, I've never felt so good. Anyway... give me a call. I miss you. There you go. - Is that all? - That's all. You'll receive a confirmation letter in a few days. Great! I really appreciate it. You're welcome. Bye. Benloulou! What's gotten into you? Enough. Get rid of them! Africans might be your thing, but not mine. My "thing"? Maybe you're frustrated as well as racist? Ever heard of a microcredit? Or Muhammad Yunus, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize? He's Bangladeshi. Probably not your thing either. But it's the future, here in France and everywhere else. - Look into it, you'll see I'm right. - OK. I'll think about it. My apologies. I've thought about it. I can't fire you, so either I relocate you to some grim backwater or you resign. Well, since I have a choice... I resign. - Well done. - Great. Well done. Thank you. Eat! You're wasting away. I should have told him right away. - It's too late now. - No, it isn't. Of course it is, I'm screwed! No. If he'd known you weren't Jewish, you'd never have met. But this way, he's gotten to know you. He knows what he's losing. - You think? - Yes. All OK? Don't you like it? I do... - I walked out. - No! That's great! Sorry, I mean, shit. - Why? Not because of my cousins... - Thanks to them. Seriously? Then we can open our restaurant. What about me? Have you considered me? - All alone with that nut job! - No... Getting dumped is all I'm good for! Honey, stop it... You'll be fine. We'll always be here for you. Sure we will. The guy sent me photos of the garage. Come and see. Sure. It's a great deal. We can check it out tomorrow, 9:00 a.m. I do the cooking, you do the figures. We'll make a great team! I finally came out. Oh, right. Did it go well? Well, Dad's in hospital... But yeah. Shit... It changes nothing between us. The restaurant... We're still friends. So you're officially a lesbian. Yep. Officially. So... So when I hold your hand... officially, it does nothing for you. No. If I hold the other hand... officially, it still leaves you cold. Still. - If I kiss you... - Wali... Officially... You're still here? To hell with the bank. You still haven't eaten. Come on, eat. I got your message. I went to the bank but you'd left. I wanted to see you in person. I'm so... so touched. You couldn't have given me greater proof of your love. I'm so touched... I'm so happy! Let's have this baby. Come home, Simone. - Is it true, you're happy? - I really am. What does she fucking take me for? After you. So this is the garage. Plenty of space. The ceiling starts at three meters and extends to six. Floor space is 25m by 6m, for a total area of 150m². Yes, it's... It's beautiful. You're in the restaurant business? My partner is. He's meant to be here, I'll call him. Excuse me a moment. Take your time. Wali here. Leave a message. Hi, Wali, it's Simone. I don't know where you are. I'm visiting the premises. Let me know. Give me a call. Sorry, excuse me. I've left him a ton of messages but he won't call, not even a text message. - I'm not Jewish so I'm nothing to him. - No... It's true! If he loved me he'd have called me back. He's probably met a dozen other girls on your brother's website. - That's crazy. - We're through, I know we are. I'm sorry, I'm being a drag. I didn't even ask how things are with you. Well, they're pretty mixed up. You and Claire looked so beautiful together the other day. Simone! Éric? Éric! I don't care that your name isn't Simone. - I love you! - I love you too! Come on up! I love you... Géraldine. My name's Géraldine. I love you too! I was scared I'd never see you again. I don't care if you're not Jewish, I want to live with you. I want to marry you. I'm leaving. - Hello. - Miss Benloulou. Hello. - Is Wali here? - No, he left. Left? He went to see his mother in Marseille, to meet his betrothed. I don't get it, we're buying a restaurant together. What restaurant? Come in. Now listen. Here's some sisterly advice. Wali and white girls... Ask him, he's had plenty. It never works out. You're too different. You think love will triumph but mixed couples don't work. - We're just business partners... - I've seen plenty like you. It's better that we marry our own. Wali left because he knew it couldn't last. - I don't think you... - He's right! You've no idea what's in store. Even if it worked out, the difficulties you'd face... Wali's family will never accept you. His mother will keep introducing girls to him. They'll be your rivals. So take my advice. Forget about him, for your own good. It's a bad dream. Set yourself free, honey. Wali doesn't deserve a pretty girl like you. There are plenty of other men. I'm serious. Forget him. Goodbye. Ladies and gentlemen, we will shortly be arriving at Marseille St Charles, our final stop. Hi. - Marine Bleue? - Sure, get in. - Hi. - Hello. - I'm looking for a Sarratou Diara. - Sarratou Diara... I don't know her... Hey, guys! There are lots of Diaras. - She's marrying her son off to a girl. - Better a girl than a guy! Something's going on in C block. They haven't stopped cooking. C block, right. Thank you. Bye. Hello, is Wali here? Wali! Wali... It's for you. - Why are you here? - I need to talk to you. You can't stay here. Why did you leave before seeing the garage? - Something wrong? - Who is she? - I don't know. - Let me deal with this. - Go... - Why did you leave? You ran back to your girlfriend. I was just a lay, right? Would I be here if you were? - You want to dishonor my family? - It's a misunderstanding. My son is... You can't get married. You're getting married, so... I don't know... I don't know where I'm at. What I see is a fucking dyke. Sure, I'm a fucking dyke. And a fucking Jew too! And you're a fucking black Muslim. What of it? You'd marry a stranger to please your mother? Miss, please go home. Get rid of her, Wali! It's OK... Forget it, Simone. It's too late. - Don't do this. - Stop it! Don't do it! Simone, it's Claire. Where are you? Why aren't you picking up? I thought you wanted us to be together. Please call, I'm worried about you. I love you. Simone, it's me again. I've left you ten messages. You can't do this to me and just say nothing. If you don't want to see me, say so. Quiet... Be quiet now, please. Noëlle, the groom's mother, will sing a song for her son. - Sir, please... - It's OK, leave him, - I know him. - You know him? What did I tell you? No, no... Who are these two? This is... This is... Claire. My girlfriend. And Wali. My lover. - Dad! - Is there a doctor in the house? Stop it, Dad. I prefer you as a lesbian.
