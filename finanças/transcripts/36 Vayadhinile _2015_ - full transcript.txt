Take a look at this Remember the saree worn by Vani in that 'Vani Rani' Tamil serial! How are you? - Teacher, how are you? - I'm on top of the world Saw you on TV Very happy!

I'm simple as always! Even now I'm travelling only by bus - Ma'am, you can sit - That's okay No, please sit down Girija, I haven't met the President as yet And I'm the center of attention After my meeting, papers and TV will give me full coverage Only Black cats security for me after that Sir, it's getting late Please check Everyone is waiting outside for you Come fast I'm begging you one last time I'm very tensed Tell me at least now Only in my womb, you were my daughter After that you've grown as a son to your dad Continue to be like this forever Good morning, sister Call me after you reach - See you - Take care What kind of hotel is this!

They checked me like I was a terrorist And the toffee as if it was a bomb! Then 4 demons landed 'Sit, stand, don't turn, don't breathe' They tortured me with such clipped commands Pin drop silence Suddenly a man announced the President's arrival ...in a thundering voice And pushed me to and fro like a road roller Alibaba's door opens Some more demons joined the burly men around me My eyes closed slightly But poor President! Don't know what happened to him But when I saw him last, he seemed hazy to me I open my eyes I'm in hospital Anyone will faint if this is what happened In Indian history this is the first time So Mithila told me Let's go I'm feeling self conscious No one pays you to be self-conscious or shy Keep feeling shy and work Look!

Record number of 'likes' Log in and see for yourself Everyone wants to know ...if I'm going to Ireland by train or bus! Everyone is so proud of their mom You are the only one humiliating me If she is so sensitive about a Facebook page how will she face real problems in life? Looks like Facebook will decide how people must lead their lives My darling mom! What is it? I'm taking you out for dinner Get dressed - What is this flavor? - Death by chocolate Death? Violence has crept even into ice creams! When I was in school... ...we had only popsicles and vanilla ice pops And eat secretly without telling our parents If they knew, our backs got bruised black and blue I can't finish this Will you share some? Oh no! I don't want Eat what you can, the rest I'll lick to the last spoonful I'll go and take a look at the fish tank over there Watch your step Were you also teased in your office because of me?

One year? 2 years? Till I don't know when... ...I should simply go to work and come back And then? Your parents are healthy enough My world revolves around you and my daughter I'm not standing in the way of anyone's dream Without Mithi in my life... ...I can't even imagine being here She's too young to understand As her mom, she needs me I need her too You isn't as dependent as you think she is She'll manage everything She spoke to me in a mature manner Anyway she'll be staying with me Such a golden opportunity shouldn't be- For a 13 year old, more than opportunity... ...there are many more necessities as priority She may not understand what I need to tell or do for her as a mother But don't you understand either? You may be a good father But you can never step into a mother's shoes Vasanthi, move with the times Not stick to old sentiments Be practical 'Family' means parents and child being together When did that become old sentiment? If life is only about International school and syllabus... my daughter doesn't need that My daughter should be with me I knew you will stick to your viewpoint and not budge an inch She is dying to study there As her dad I should make her dream come true If I leave her behind now... ...what if something happens to her? I will ensure nothing untoward happens I'm not sure of that Trapped within 4 walls, I don't want her becoming another 'Vasanthi' That's why I'm taking her with me Not stagnate watching the same old faces Or be a slave to tradition Let her have exposure See and live in a different world Let go of her Study well Do your work yourself instead of troubling dad It will be an unfamiliar place New schoolmates, neighbors you'll meet and befriend Irrespective of what anyone tells you... ...always check with your dad first Confide in your dad however trivial it may be Listen only to him No one else on earth will want the best for you... ...other than your parents No one else Don't worry, mom I've downloaded Viber, Vonage 10 different apps on your phone I'll call you everyday after I get home from school It will be 10:30 p.m here You'll be in bed I'll talk to you till you fall asleep Whatever it is I'll ask only you Wherever I may live I'm your daughter, mom That can never change I'll call as soon as we land Come Don't worry about us We will manage But don't leave Vasanthi alone here for too long Shall I tell you that question now, ma? No, it's okay She has special class today Please pick her up on your way back from work I must go to Ireland I don't know how But I have to go for my daughter's sake I've lived for my husband and daughter for 14 long years By telling everyone my husband and daughter are abroad... I can't stay here by myself even for a single day, Girija Parents generally ask 'where did you go?' Friends usually say 'long time no see' But you ask the wife 'He got up only at 10:00 a.m, and didn't even have breakfast' 'He said he'll be back home for lunch after 2:00 p.m' She'll narrate by the hour! Every wife is a witness to her husband I also wanted to be that kind of a wife And bear testimony to my husband's life Even if he didn't like it! Mithila feels ashamed to call me her mom He's embarrassed to introduce me as his wife! I don't know what I have done with my life But I've always been true to everyone My daughter shouldn't be like me She shouldn't become another 'Vasanthi' He said this and took her away I should've fallen dead when he said those words Vasanthi? Then what was Vasanthi to him? What is she in that house today? I feel ashamed, Girija I lost myself only because I thought my family was there for me But now I have no one I must find myself! Everyone told me Even Mithila told me To check out Facebook I want to see it now Why do you want to rake that now? Just leave it How can it get any worse? Show me the comments 'Vasanthi, are you a servant or a Govt servant?' 'How terrible' 'This is the real ritual of falling at one's feet' 'Welcome, Tamilian lady' 'Vasanthi, the President is on TV' 'Switch it off' '10 million people in Tamil Nadu drink and are steady on their feet' 'But why did you faint, Vasanthi?' 'Is this Vasanthi Chellamuthu of 1998 Economics batch?' 'I don't think so' 'It can't be our Vasanthi' Collector is calling you He came only 10 minutes ago There's a lady officer inside his cabin We've never seen her in the department before! Maybe it's an enquiry Or will they ask her to demonstrate how she fainted? Collector is in there So pipe down Susan...?! She's my college mate Luckily, she's my friend too Dress code in our college was a big issue 20 of us were suspended for 15 days during exams One who fought with the Principal and made us go back to our classes again... was this Vasanthi! Only after this episode, I became her friend In fact, she was my inspiration I must catch up with 14 years of our lives I have lots to ask and even more to share Who is that? What are you doing here? Leave this place at once Should we leave at once? Outsiders are not allowed inside Leave the premises now Or I'll complain to the Principal Okay, go and complain Susan, why get into trouble? He might actually complain 'We'll fight we'll protest' 'Dress code is our wish' We'll fight we'll protest Dress code is our wish Dress code is our right In our college none of us dress in a vulgar manner Nor do we pass hurtful comments We take everything sportively If their sister or mother's sari slips or slides unexpectedly... or if their dress is transparent how will they react, sir? They should be the ones to learn to behave without differentiating Dress won't make someone a celebrity or a nonentity We cannot accept this dress code, sir Where is that Vasanthi? I don't know I must search for her I thought this is life and bent backwards Now I'm completely broken, Susan Is this Vasanthi talking? I can't think of any student who didn't glorify you then I didn't possess half your caliber But I watched you and wanted to study and behave like you! I took you as my inspiration And I'm the Chief Marketing Officer in a multinational corporation now What happened to you? I can't- Don't tell me clichs like 'I lived for my family and kids' Even a mother who feeds her kids selflessly and goes to bed hungry... is sent to an Old age home by the very same kids It's a selfish society we live in There are 5 do's a girl can do And 50 don'ts she should not do We can do the 5 which everyone likes But can't do the 50 we dream about! That's how simple a life of a woman is Since we are the answers for everything... ...they thrive being the questions If we become the question... ...nobody will have an answer! It's okay if you are the Vasanthi no one knows But how did you turn into a Vasanthi who's being mocked by everyone? Instead of just living... ...isn't it more important to live with self-respect? Don't spend your lifetime being... ...this Vasanthi who daily signs the attendance register It's natural for women to live for others But also set aside some time just for you You need an identity of your own! If you lose yourself... ...your dreams will also be lost right before you You aren't like that Your dream is your signature! You can do it You definitely can In the way these girls dress and their carefree smiles... ...a 'Vasanthi' is hidden I need to see that Vasanthi From now on I want to see only that Vasanthi Good morning, madam Madam, I read it Super! You truly rock Fantastic, madam What's up? Everybody is praising you sky high! With good reason I'll tell you Madam, my son showed it to me I felt so proud What is it? I'll show you in Facebook Dear Facebook friends A big and warm hello I'm Vasanthi 36 years old This is my true identity Dear boys and girls in Facebook who hide their true identity... ...using Suriya and Nayantara's photos as their profile pics I'm the one who fainted when I met the Indian President I disgraced all of you and our nation to bow your heads in shame Due to other priorities in my personal life ...and because daily like all of you I couldn't afford to be in Facebook let me 1st apologize for this delay in E-meeting you Even though comments and cartoons about me were remarkably funny... ...if I share with you the actual event ...it will help your creative juices to flow even better! Please focus your attention 100% I was waiting in the hall Surrounding me were 7 Black Cats 4 White Cats Only one was a female Messages kept beeping through wireless nonstop That the President was on his way Not a whisper Trust me! I was the only one breathing Tup! Door opens And in walks the President of India The most important second in the history of the world The President stood right in front of me, clasped both his hands And said, 'Namaste' Giving up all your spare time as offering to Facebook Exhibiting without inhibitions ...your love and personal space ...to Tom, Dick and Jane in the most willing manner Friends who render such social service This dizzy spell isn't new to me 1st time I had this dizzy spell when I met a man I became his wife The 2nd time I fainted I became a mother By fainting in front of the President I became a 'sister' to every one of you 'Fainting' has always placed me on a pedestal There's a lot of time left My dear kith and kin Wait and see Hats off, no one will open their mouths again There is 1 more mouth to zip! Good Lord! Please come I'm just looking for the kind of design you'll like I want to meet Tulasi'ma She fell sick yesterday The boy in our shop took her to the doctor Do you want her address? Yes Please wait for 5 minutes I'll get it for you My inbox is overflowing Do you know how many of my friends praised you? From where did you pick up this courage? One day I just thought I'm Mithila's mother That's all You should have seen dad's reaction, ma He saw the video 2-3 times He inserted his ID card in the ATM He took the milk packet into the loo! His system is corrupt Needs to be reset - Where is dad? - Not yet back from work Do you water our plants daily, ma? This will be cleared within the next 2 days I've asked for help to dismantle Why, mom? Flowering season is over To plant fresh vegetables I must start all over again Who is here to help me do all this? Food is my main problem here The food we eat once a year in India... ...we eat 365 days here and that's terrible, ma Just make some yummy food and send it to me through whatsApp Very soon I'll be in Ireland Don't worry Show me your cheek Love you, muah I came to see you Welcome me with open arms I heard you aren't well Old age is catching up on me Really...you came only to see me? Of course This is for you Why did you go to all this trouble? All grown on my terrace Sit down I'll get you coffee No, not now I have 4 sons None of them visit me to find out how I am Believe it or not Just this morning I was thinking, if I had a daughter... ...would she have neglected me like this? And you are here now Then what...am I not your daughter? I'm of no use to anyone And just to see me you came all this way Come inside If you need to go to the hospital... ...let me know, I'll take you That isn't a problem I'm quite mobile What we need is the confidence someone is there for us There should be That's enough assurance to live a 100 years Who has that kind of time nowadays? In spite of your busy schedule... ...you took the trouble of visiting me at home I won't forget this till my dying day I'll take leave This is extremely clean This is eggplant from the market If you find an insect inside then it is devoid of chemicals! If the vegetable was sprayed with insecticide how will the insect thrive inside? Take a look Nowadays like cheap dyes in textiles... ...they also inject dyes into fruits Look at this duplicate How mouth watering it is with its ripe red color Are people eating this crap? Do they have a choice? Even the winner of 'Masterchef'... ...can't get the right flavor using this This generation is oblivious to a tasty gourmet meal This is the bitter truth If you give me vegetables that are so fresh and organic our wedding feast will be the talk of the town I take full responsibility for it Why did you bring me here? Don't say a word Just nod your head I'll handle it It is only for your benefit Come with me I have made a list of vegetables Sir? Come in Good afternoon Oh! I know you She was the one who visited my shop This is chef Selur Pichai Good afternoon Please take a seat The vegetables you gave Tulasi'ma were delicious She gave us some Without fertilizers clean and also tasty I want you to supply the same quality I'll buy it for whatever price you quote No rush, you can deliver in September You have 5 months to grow fresh supplies Then no problem, sir Whoever cooks with your vegetables... ...will definitely dish out a tasty meal This is a list for 2000 guests How many? If we need more? My 2000 can easily accommodate 200 more This is for my daughter's wedding reception All credit goes to Tulasi'ma Is that so? Let's go Tulasi'ma told me about your 1.5 acre farm Don't supply to anyone else I'll buy the whole lot from you But don't use pesticides I'm not prepared to poison my guests! Tick whatever items you can supply from this list Rest I'll outsource If you tell me within a week, that's okay by me Thank you - I'll take leave - Please do I'll deal with you outside He has given a list like Hanuman's tail! With this header 'Lord Muruga's support' Onion 40 Kg Tomato 35 Kg Carrot 25 Kg Potato 20 Kg Green peas 5 Kg This is a list for a whole market Are you mad or what? I thought he needed vegetables for his house I had no clue it was a wedding order, dear You said I own a farm of 1.5 acres I thought it would add to your image Tell him my huge farm split into 2 in an earthquake I'll lose my job, dear Give a convincing reason Why ask me? You must only pay for your mistakes You said you are like my own daughter Okay, I have an idea He asked me to tick what I can supply And he'll outsource the rest, right? I'll tick the header with God's support Ask him to buy the rest outside What's the matter, sis? This is my problem What is this? Onion, tomato...! You call this an order? Bro, don't forget my commission Go and fetch the party Come inside, sis We must deliver separately to the hotel Bro, this is the lady who ordered Mani, help with the delivery Okay, bro Madam, don't lose the list Send it a week before the function I'll bill you according to that day's rate If it's bought a week before... ...won't the vegetables rot? Will be fresh even for 10 days 1 day for plucking 1 day for packing 2 days in the lorry 2 days with me 3 days in the retail outlet 4 days in your fridge It will altogether add up to 15 days Growing vegetables in our back yard... ...is a thing of the past We spray all this pesticide... ...to only increase shelf life Onion over there is from Pakistan If vegetables shouldn't ripe ...and if fruits should be ripe ...we have to resort to some gimmicks But they want organic vegetables No problem at all At that point of time, dip them in mud like this They'll be as good as new For flies to squat on it... ...all you got to do is spray this It will become organic Don't you have real, organic vegetables? Such vegetables don't exist in our country Promptly in the seed stage must mix chemicals And spray fertilizers 4-5 times till they grow What happens to the consumer who eats all this poison? Poison won't scare him away Only price will make him run a mile! It isn't as if tomatoes are for the rich... ...and eggplants for the poor It is one and the same for all You need any of the items here... ...let me know, I'll have them delivered Stretch out the carbide fully It has to ripen at the same time Did you hear me? Okay, bro Is Mithila there? Ask her to call me when she gets back Talk to Vasanthi, she is here Go ahead, dear I'm at work I'll call after 5 minutes Okay I'm expecting a call from my husband I'll call you later Sir, I'm Vasanthi speaking Tell me I'll take up your order I'll pay you an advance whenever you want Where is this place, Vasanthi? Netherland Many countries have succeeded in this greenhouse concept Is this feasible in our city? Most farmers are having a tough time And that too how will you succeed here? Terrace is ideal for boozing And playing cards will be a roaring success How's this possible? What is the budget for this greenhouse? Up to Rs 20,000 If we grow vegetables in 10 terraces... ...we'll get enough produce for 2000 people to eat Enough to supply a wedding at one go This is the estimate Plus we will be eating organic food Mutton is even more healthy Goat is organic! Only if you read the newspaper daily... ...will you realize the truth behind that lady's words Baseless arguments and pointless digs... ...are reasons why India is vegetating! Shall we do this? Definitely we will, Vasanthi I need some time to mobilize funds Even if we have to pledge our jewelry... ...it's okay, we'll do it See you, Vasanthi You want to grow vegetables on a terrace And supply for a wedding Do you have any brains? You'll never change It's my bloody fate No, all of us intend to join- Don't do anything We've got very little respect left Please don't tarnish even that From fainting to wedding... ...will you keep humiliating me? Whatever you do won't take off You have a Govt job till you retire Attend to it, enough What did my son say? Don't trouble yourself Go to work Take adequate rest I want to take a loan in my name Sugar level is okay Liver function okay Your cholesterol is high You must run Out of this city? What happened to your terrace antics? As usual, problem for men is their male chauvinism! All the ladies are fine with my idea But they don't have the money If I can take a loan- If we can walk 4 kms a day? If cholesterol is reduced? In 2 weeks, I'll sign guarantee for your loan Sounds good to hear If it's a loan on your insurance... ...only if you're above 40 ...you need to show a medical fitness report Then what's the hitch? Whole world knows of your fainting spell! So you are implying the media will support me I don't regret being an only child I'm born with pain Suffering is not new to me Childbirth is the pinnacle of pain If there is any pain worse than that... ...it is when her husband humiliates her I have gone through that too Suffering is not new to me I will walk Even if I can't... ...I'll surely run Vasanthi...? I've been a teacher for 40 years But about organic food... ...or a hygienic life style ...not even once have I taught any student Thinking that reviewing is knowledge... ...my entire generation has crumbled to fall But as a form of atonement I intend going door to door I'll explain your concept to everyone in this area Don't worry your pretty little head Go ahead boldly We are all here for you "With wings flapping fit freedom on my wish list" "I fly into horizons expanding" "Into yonder blue skies ascending" "To sounds of the universe new music to traverse" "I walk on shores extending to meet my goal pending" "A wish list of my very own" "A dream where men don't wear the crown" "A journey seeking new responsibility" "My sandals will be my new wings of identity" "I walk baby steps enlightening" "I revel in a fresh re-awakening" "With grit I venture into this green adventure" "With great gusto my dream I follow" I run with faith and hope Hurdles I intend to cope "In a square world I thought we lived" "4 walls they were I realized later" "I am setting foot on a journey to the rim of the earth bravely" "I detached myself from me I drifted about aimlessly" "I seize the day carpe diem My live life to the fullest anthem" "Darkness in my mind eclipsing light as a trailblazer I'm clasping" "To the suns rays of radiance I want to add my little luminance" "I gain ground with steps bold to empower women in our world" "Entering exciting territory to gather many a trophy "With wings flapping fit Liberty on my wish list" "With sunshine and success mine I sprint to the finishing line" "In our world with sounds varied echoing with applause rallied" "I race towards victory" "To etch my foot prints in history" Top Indian architects, ministers... ...many celebrities are gathered here A request Don't forget to wash your hands These vegetables are from our market Endosulfan, Ecolex, chlordane, fungicide Some other chemicals might have also rubbed off on to your hands Liver, kidney dysfunction... ...depression and cancer 'Food is medicine, medicine is food' ...is what our forefathers have said They have set a timetable in diet and lifestyle... ...which is our treasured legacy Without being selfish... ...they planted palm trees in their backyards They thought of the needs of the future generation All this has become folklore now Carrot with Vitamin A is good for the eyes Tomato with Vitamin C gives immunity String beans is a source of B complex Eggplant provides calcium Besides this, Endosulphan and Furidon ...and many other toxic stuff abound in these vegetables The skin of the apple used to be nutritious Now it only contains wax Even if poisoned vegetables are expensive... ...poison is sold cheapest in India Our grandmothers had a dozen children The kids were raised not only by the mother Anyway that's quite impossible Nature lent a hand too Now with 1 or 2 kids... ...we rush to pediatricians so often The previous generation suffered only from old age Now even the unborn baby has a heart problem At a tender age of 5 kids wear glasses 10 year olds are diagnosed with diabetes, asthma or cancer Many more diseases Rather than being healthy... ...we give importance to beauty Children should study in a reputable school A cushy job in a corporate firm We think of buying a house Or saving our funds Why don't we think of being healthy? We destroy fields And build concrete jungles Time should not reaffirm 'men are living graveyards' This is the right moment We should spring into action We should trust our motherland In future, when we build houses... ...reserve at least 1 cent space to grow trees and a vegetable garden On terraces as greenhouse Just like water harvesting was feasible... ...greenhouse is possible on each and every terrace Friends, my fainting spell was the talk of the town In another week's time... ...we'll be supplying organic vegetables for a wedding with a 2000 guest list ...grown on neighboring terraces only by ladies We should carry out 2 good deeds at once Each individual in his or her lifetime... ...should plant a seed for at least 1 tree For our children to lead a healthy life... ...in every garden or terrace we should grow vegetables We should go back to respecting the soil as our mother And merge with nature like our forefathers did I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart I came here today like just another meeting In fact to prevent food from being adulterated... ...Govt is taking many steps But beyond that, your 'need of the hour' talk should reach the public for sure I'll inform all the members of the Legislative assembly This should change into a movement Volunteers like you should take the lead Definitely I'm glad I'll take leave Meeting was a huge success Minister himself- Go inside, my dear You've changed a lot?! Past 2 days, you didn't even show your face on Skype to us! Where is Mithila? She has her exams now Our neighbors are Tamilians Their daughter and Mithila are classmates Nothing to worry Are you happy now? We leave on the 2nd You've got just enough time to pack How can I suddenly office? Take 1 year off We'll think about it later Not just that I have some commitments here Did you see our terrace? Yes, I did I saw the neighbors' terraces also I've also spoken to dad He'll take care of it Loan isn't a big deal Food and climate are major problems in Ireland Mithila is having a tough time I don't know how to take care of her I feel bad about all this Thought of employing a housekeeper But that would cost easily 50 to 60,000 And that too part time What? For being so frank If you had found a good housekeeper would you have applied for my visa? Oh! Madam has learnt to retort! If wives keep cooking thrice a day husbands will get bored So wives now are forced to think differently! Before taking this decision you could have discussed it with me Okay, what are you saying now? I've joined hands with many people boosting everyone's confidence I've taken up a big project If I leave half way it won't be right for sure I need some time Mithila, your mom isn't keen on coming I don't know Ask her yourself You've got lot of commitments here You find it tough to come over now Tell her yourself Mithila? First stop crying Okay, I'll be with you I know, I'll come I'll come Is this your 1.5 acre farm? Your speech has been published in The Hindu Through the Food Safety department our Govt is raiding the district markets This self help group with only women really rocks! Congratulations Only 6 more days for the wedding This is like a wedding in your own family Distribute these invitations please All of you should definitely attend We will, sir Everyone will come for sure But I doubt if I can make it! I'm going to Ireland with my husband on 2nd But vegetables will be delivered to the wedding hall on the 5th I'll arrange everything before I go Oh! Is that so? I'd have been glad if you had attended It's okay Have a safe trip I'll take leave Why all of a sudden, Vasanthi? I must go for Mithila's sake! I've applied for a year's leave Only after I go there I can decide anything else Girija will really miss you You're both like twins I bought you a gift But I forgot to bring it! I have a gift for madam Book right? Must be a Tamil book But you won't understand a word Am I right? No, you're wrong Don't be alarmed The question Mithila asked the President Mithila's friend Vani is my neighbor She told me Vasanthi Vasanthi What are you doing here without packing your bags? Don't worry All the vegetables in Ireland are organic You know what Mithila asked the President? She did tell me One day when we fought you said a girl's dream will expire after marriage! It seems her question was... ...triggered by our fight Hats off to that question! Indira Gandhi was the only lady among the 14 Prime ministers to hold office Among our 15 Presidents Pratiba Patil was the only lady Why? In this nation are there no intelligent, capable women? Or has someone hacked their dreams? Who decides the expiry date of a woman's dream? Today in many states women are the leaders Many of them who fight for a cause are women None of them have lost their dreams Nor melted in their own tears! I'm not coming to Ireland My daughter asked me such a question I'll make her understand! Call her now 1st time I'm acting against your wishes I'm your wife Respect that bond and understand me 'Not only in Tamil Nadu but all over India...' '...she popularized this Greenhouse scheme' 'Though an ordinary clerk taking a loan in her name' 'she created awareness in the entire neighborhood' 'Legislative council appreciates Mrs Vasanthi' 'Today is my mom's birthday' '2 years ago, on this day I looked at this same page...' 'I've cried nonstop reading the sarcastic digs at my mom 'Today in the same page' 'I'm being respected as her daughter' 'For every house serving poison-free food' 'my mother is the main reason' 'People praise me too!' 'If someone asks me what I want to become in future' 'my answer will only be' '...like Vasanthi!' 'Thank you Vasanthi for being my mother!' 'It is a year since I've been away from my mom' 'When I cried, my mom said' 'the present generation of girls should cry only for a valid reason' 'Let wimpy women who cried at the drop of a hat' 'be wiped out completely with our generation' 'You should stand as example for all the tears shed by women world over' 'Sure, mom' 'I am suddenly struck by an unexplainable fear' 'Today is an important day in my mom's life' 'Namaste' 'Today my mom is here' 'Not for the question I asked' 'But as an answer for that question!' 2 years ago, I wanted to meet an ordinary woman who asked me an extraordinary question I was disappointed Today, I'm meeting the same woman to discuss... how to implement her vision on a national level? You fainted But you woke up Young man, you should be very proud of your wife! You introduced 'me' to myself and made me understand... ...Delhi and Vizag are only 3 hours apart Susan, thanks, I owe this journey to you I'm going to Ireland for a month Then my husband, Mithila and I are planning a trip to Europe Must see the world, right? I'll also be in Europe at that time We should meet up too Definitely Before I forget, happy birthday Today is a day I can never forget in my whole life! I have found my husband and daughter with respect intact, Susan This is Vasanthi How old are you? It doesn't matter 'Your dream is your signature!'
