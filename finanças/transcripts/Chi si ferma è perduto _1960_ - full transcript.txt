- Good morning! - Good morning! - Is the head office in the office? - Yes. He has a devil for his hair. - How are we doing with Lotto? - Bad. This week I've just done both. - But the dream had given a triplet. - 17, disgrace. 90, fear. - And the blood? - You didn't tell me. I explained it to you well: I fell from the 5th floor, ... .. I said: "What a misfortune, what fear", and my blood came out. However, better a both today than a chicken tomorrow. - Get the numbers even from the knight. - The knight snores. - Who told you I snore? - Cavalier Guardalavecchia. - Who could it be? But what do you know? - Yes, she snores. I have the misfortune of living next to him and I feel everything. What did I hear tonight! To his lady! Aren't you ashamed ?! - If I told you what I heard, you'd get a quinterna. - Of you! - I have nothing to hide. - Forget it. What delicate ears he has! Go outside and don't confide! Please leave! Be patient, you have to stop! - I don't understand ... - I realized that something was missing underneath. What are you missing? Can't work! - It's been twenty years since you rub my pillow every morning . - I?! - Give me the pillow! - What pillow ?! - You got it underneath! - Where is it? - There he is! - Who put it on? Was it you? I don't need a pillow! I feel good! Ready? Pasquetti Transport Company! - Ice creams! - Ice cream ... - Ice cream, candy! Ready? Ah, ma'am ... Yes, it's here, I'll pass it to you right away. - I have the misfortune of having him near. The Lady. - Your wife? - Was my wife calling you? And yours. - Was he calling you? - He was calling me. - Italy, it's you. What's up? Assunta says that if she doesn't have the salary in an hour, she'll go away! Italy, don't bother me! I am a frontline fighter here ! I have been fighting our head of office for thirty years ! What do I care? Enough, don't bother me anymore! I said don't bother me! - Excuse me Miss. - Who is it? My wife? - Yes, I'm fine, and you? - It is my wife? Guardalavecchia! - One moment. - Let me talk! Do you want your husband? I'll pass it to you right away. - Hello. - Were you very angry this morning? "Chèri", I told you not to call me at the office, I'm always busy . I need to hear you love me. Don't go around the house undressed, put on your robe. Easily catches a cold. Pull the balcony curtain. Little man, sing me our song. - No, "mon amour", the song no. - Yes, come on! - The song no! - Come on, sing me our song! - Sing it to him. I don't hear my voice this morning. I can not. Call later. # True, there are angels! True, I believe in miracles! # COLABONA! GUARDALAVECCHIA! What's up? Don't be stupid! Arrive late, hang around all day ... .. and stay on the phone for hours! - I'll have you transferred to Sardinia! - No! - It's too far, I can't swim! - We will see it! - Are you coming too? - Where is it? - In Sardinia. - No! - It seemed. - Soon! Get back to work! - Yup! Colabona! Colabona! Come on, let's get back to work, come on. No! Are we kidding ?! Tamburini! - Transport Pasquetti, say! - I'm here for a complaint. Among many things delivered badly, there is this clock that does not "cuckoo". A cuckoo clock makes "cuckoo", if not, what cuckoo is it? This makes some dubious noises, it's a shame to hear it! "Provolo"! - "Provolo"? "Try it"! - It's the same. - He has a foreign accent. Trapani, I understand. Let's see'... - Do you hear? - Oh God... - Was it her? - It was him! - He? Ah yes, I have one too and he plays the same joke on me. But I have the key. It is an overshoot, a kind of "fetecchia". He will see that he no longer does it. During transport he was tossed around and his beak blocked. When his beak was blocked, the "cuckoo" came out from the opposite side. - I get it. - These are accidents that can happen to anyone. - If you keep it and never come back here. - But I have other complaints to make! The Pasquetti company makes the perfect transports! - Go away! - It does not end here! - It ends where it wants! Go away! - Pay attention! - He seems crazy to me. - Good morning! - Our best client is coming : the deaf! - What a pleasure! - Please, take a seat! Good morning! I offer my greetings to the nicest employees in Naples! - To the most painful of antique dealers in the center-south ... - Thank you! Not only that, he is also the most stingy of all the stingy I have known! Too good! With the millions he has, he hasn't bought a hearing aid yet! - Avaraccio! - I'll ship it, sure! - Is the quote ready? - For an idiot like you, express service! - Boom! - Ah, it's the same! You never give me a reduction, yet I'm an old customer. - BUMBA! BUMBA! - Health! Are you cold, huh? - He no longer has hair from deafness. - BUMBA! - Then goodbye! - BUM! - I'll let you know something. - BUM! BUM! BUM! Treat that cold. The weather is bad. - BUM! BUM! BUM! - Venga. What were you doing ?! We were illustrating the feast of San Gennaro to our deaf client. We'll talk again. Meet the new colleague, Cavallo. - Our two oldest employees. - Pleasure. - Accountant Colabona. Very lucky. Donato Cavallo from Catania. A nice step forward in our big family: from Catania to Naples. - A nice gallop! - Silence! In Rome I aim. It can be said that the march on Rome begins here ! Another? Eh, no. You two who are the senior employees , fix the Horse well! - In the stable? - Silence! I leave you to your work! Please, work! Goodbye, dear Horse! - What's he laughing at? - I didn't laugh, I did this ... - I have to do this! - Do it! Dear colleagues, "I am very happy to have come to Naples"! What females! Neapolitan females! I modestly know how to do with them! With all attack! Will you allow a phone call? - You are welcome. - He did! - I have to organize myself, I 'm exuberant. - I have to do the math. - Modestly. - You can see that he is exuberant! - I know. - "Exuberant"! Hello, Nicoletta? "Donato are"! Horse! I arrived now from Catania! I'm in the office, I have a direct line! - What number is it? - Here? 81384. 81384! Call me when you are willing! Goodbye, "loving"! Will you allow me another phone call? - Sit down! - Another one? - We need a backup female. - I'm doing the math ... - Take your time. Marilù! Honey! "Horse I am"! Donated! I arrived now from Catania! I'm in the office, I have a direct line! - What number is it? - The first. - I do not remember. - 81384! 81384! Call me when you are willing! - Thank you, colleagues. I should do another one, but that's enough for today. - Yeah. GUARDALAVECCHIA! COLABONA! It could only be you two! I've been trying to call for half an hour! Set a bad example even for the new employee! But it won't end here, I'll have you transferred to Sardinia! No! Sardinia no! I am fed up! I protest! - Are you protesting ?! - I ... Yes, I protest! - We protest! - We are two! - We can't take it anymore! For every little thing: "Colabona! Guardalavecchia!". I will hold a press conference, I will convene newspapers and magazines! I will resort to the law! Everyone must know who the head of office Cesare Santoro is! It won't do you any good, you'll have to pass over my corpse ... .. to avoid the punishment that awaits you! But I am here, alive and well, and will be here another 100 years! Friends, our Cesare, the good Santoro, has passed away. Let me go with my pain, ... .. and you stay with colleague Guardalavecchia, dear Antonio. Honor the body of Caesar, ... .. and the speech designed to exalt the glory of Caesar, ... .. which Antonio, under our license, is in charge of keeping. Oh, Antonio. Friends! Fellow citizens! Colleagues! Give me your ears! I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him, ... .. and to give to Caesar what is Caesar's, ... .. since we have never been able to give it to him while alive . It will be said that Cesare was gruff, he had an unfriendly air, ... .. but Cesare was a man of honor. Some will say that he looked repulsive and was always frowning. - But Cesare ... - He was a man of honor! Friends near and far, today Cesare Santoro, who was a man of honor, ... .. leaves an unbridgeable void. Who will ever have the courage to replace him? Who will ever have the daring, the presumption, the boldness ... .. to occupy that beautiful and very spacious desk ?! - Holy gods, what are you doing ?! - Stop with your hands! - Go away! - Get up! Don't push! - I ... I just pushed! No, he touched me! She gets her hands on! - What does he do? - What belongs to me. - How do you mean?! This desk of the good soul seems tailor-made for me! The command post suits me! I am satisfied with this test! Ah, he does it for proof! Well I meant! - Leave, the dust is mine! - It belongs to everyone! - Remember, Mr. Colabona ... - Guardalavecchia! - Mr. Colabona! - Say, Guardalavecchia! - I look who I like! - I'm saying your last name! - Puts a touch of irony on the "old woman". - You on the "bona". - I don't put anything on the "bona"! - And I nothing on the "old"! - Look, Mr. Colabona, I'm here too! - Unfortunately! - How they fight! - Friends have become enemies! We have the same rights, the same seniority, the same status of service. If you want to be "acting", do it! But I do it too, because I work too ! Pull yourself in there! Okay, take a seat! So from here I'm not new! - Do what you want! - No, this was here! - This must be here! - He was here! - Then I'll take this! - Thing? - No jokes, otherwise I'll do it. - Then let's do this! - Let's finish it! We make a compromise, we put everything in between. - And what do we do for the signature? - Combined. - Matched ?! - Colabona Guardalavecchia. - But let alone. - In alphabetical order. Guardalavecchia Colabona, by illiterate order. What's up?! - It is useless for you to question, everything is already decided. - As?! The good soul, when he died, left everything written. - Do you know where your characteristic notes are? - No, I don't know. - I'm up front. - I'm older. - And what does it mean?! I'm in here. An inspector general will come from Milan to examine them. And then the appointment will be a fait accompli. - This telegram is for you. - Here here... - Permission, knights. - You are welcome. - Permission. - See you later. - So Santoro had already decided. - Open up! - I don't have the keys. Do you need keys to open a telegram ? Open it with your fingers. - Did he open it? - Yes. - What does it say? "Arrive tomorrow, quick 6:30 pm, inspector general Dr. Rossi, ..." ".. who will appoint the Naples office manager to replace the deceased Santoro." "Directorate-General, ENT" Excuse me, colleague. Whatever the will of the deceased, I bow with bowed head. And she? - With my head down too. - Let's go to Capodichino. Here it is, it's him! What are you doing here ?! I'm taking some fresh air. What are you doing here ?! - I'm walking! - Oh yes? We are walking! - Colabona, off the mask! - Off the mask, Guardalavecchia! - Then? - We're here for the same purpose. - Yes. - Open the safe. - Let's open it! - Are you there? - Yup! - At work! Power! - It's a word ... - Of course! It's close! - It takes a lockpick. - I have it! - What an idea! - But we also need pliers. - I have it! - Good! - Wow! - The gripper lifts! - But we need a chisel. - Do you think I didn't bring it? - No! - Here it is! - But we also need a hammer. - I have it! - Good! - What is this? - It's a mar ... Shh! - But it would also take a crowbar. - I have it! - Yup? What port number? - No! This! - Piano ... - My day the clamp. The finger! The finger! The finger where? In the caliper? What nonsense ... - Curse! - Mamma mia, how much noise! - I hear a cry. - As? - "Here we wail inside". - Who is it?! - The cat! - The guard cat! Here is my practice! No, this is yours. Yes, nonsense ... This is a great recommendation for me . But I'm all in one piece, I do n't give a damn about the recommendation. See what I do? I tear it off. Well ... for me too. I expected worse. - Thank god. - What are you doing now? - I'll tear it off. - Because? - It's a recommendation. - Let's leave it to chance. Here we go. - Let's think seriously about what we have to do. - Yes, we think. Our fate depends on the inspector general . Our future is called Rossi! Rossi! Here I'm! Silence! We both have to go to the station tomorrow , okay? - Oh yes? Do you say so? - I say so. - And I say no! - What am I saying? - Exactly, shut up! What are you saying? Come here! I understand, you want to go to the station by yourself. You want to go to sviolinare, "to pander" ... No, we must both go, on equal terms, with dignity and pride. - May the best win! - I do not play. - Thing? "Win a million" ... How do I win it? I do not play! - You do not understand? - Would I be ignorant? - I said: "May the best win"! I understood: "Win a million". No, dear Colabona, he goes to the station alone, I give you this advantage. I don't need to "ruffle myself with goodies-and-be"! - I understand ... - I'm a man of honor, I'm a Guardalavecchia! Understood? Shut up! Did you understand what it is? Yes, I have to pretend I 'm rude. You have to be yourself: rude, ignorant, porter, rude. Human, clear? If he tries to introduce himself, he just says "Rossi" ... I punch him in the head! Well settled, strong. Then I come as a peacemaker. Please, a nice service, otherwise no money. You know me, I am a serious professional! A handsome rascal ... known ... - Here's the train. We do not know each other! - No! Oh, sorry. I'm sorry, sir, but this place is mine. I'm sorry too, but it's mine! I'm going to Naples! Here it says "Rossi"! Exactly! I am Doctor Rossi! Inspector General! - Transport! - Scholastic! - Matteo Rossi of the Pasquetti company. - Mario Rossi, school inspector. - What a strange combination. - Just check. - No doubt, but the compartment is empty. I book to stay near the corridor, in the direction of travel. - Me too. - Then I'm going to find my place. Allows? Rossi, very happy! Excuse me so much. - What are you doing ?! - Sorry, I have to pack. - Is heavy! - I feel! - Help! - Pull it up! - Ah! The hand! - Get your hands off my suitcase! - The hand! - Hands off my suitcase! Have patience, don't you have another place to put your butt? - Should I put it this way? - Neither here nor there! Rather move! I'd understand if I put it on your face, but I'm putting it here! What do you want?! - Put it where you want but not here! - He probably travels infrequently. Now it seems to me that he is exaggerating! Now I take off the pedal and put my feet where I want! - No! I have boxes full of them! - Forget it ... Every limit has a patience! What ways are they? This is not a pigsty! - Who does he think he is?! - Forget it ... This gentleman tolerates the foot, tolerates the suitcase ... ... but this is not a tolerance compartment ! Excuse me, but when I see these things, I snap! - If I don't like it I'll put my feet where I like! - Marrano! How dare you offend a gentleman who is distinguished and distinguished ?! Do you think you are talking to your brother ?! Excuse me, but when I see these things I have to intervene. For me it's a hobby. - I don't know how to thank you. - Must. - He treated him a little badly. - I also almost give him two slaps. - For charity. - I'll even give you three. - Look what his face ... You don't know me, I waged war on the Karst. To every enemy that came I gave two slaps! - I don't know how to thank you. - No, I told you, it's a hobby for me! - If you allow, I'll introduce myself, Rossi ... - I have to punch you! Rascal! How dare you "tamper" with a gentleman ?! That's enough! Go to the pigsty with your peers, slut! Holy shit! - Leave, leave ... - I couldn't take it anymore! - Ouch ... - Did it hurt her? The punch was strong! - Yup! There is a lump. Do you have some ice in your pocket? Yes, now ... What are you saying? We are on the train. It's incredible. Luckily I was there. You have the courage to face such types! Nonsense. As a child I used to kill eagles with a sling. - Not me. I am inspector. - Tell me no more. For me he can be a gentleman, a scoundrel, a thief, a criminal. I don't care, I do it out of friendship, out of a duty of humanity. - I do it for love. - Love ... - Chaste love, God forbid. - Mine is a sense of friendship! - Look what happened to me ... - You don't have to thank me. - I'm going to Naples on a mission ... Secret mission. You don't have to thank me, it's a hobby for me! I got scared! I'm afraid! This is capable of following me! He will come to the hotel, to the restaurant ... I'm afraid! - You are "unconscious", have patience. - I'm afraid all the same. - She mustn't be afraid, I'll protect her! - What do I do? - Come to my home. - No thanks. I am hospitable. We all are in the family. - I can't take advantage ... - You will come to eat, drink and sleep. - I'll have you put some wet cloths on your head. - And kind. You don't have to thank me, it's a hobby! How should I tell him ?! I am an "obilisk", that's it! Rossi! Doctor Rossi! Permission, Permission ... Here we are! - What does he do?! - I'll bring you the suitcase. - God forbid! - It is a pleasure. Doctor Rossi? Doctor Rossi? Doctor Rossi? Isn't that Dr. Rossi? Sorry. - Are you looking for Dr. Rossi? - Yes I am. If you are Dr. Rossi, I have to punch you! - No, let's go this way. - What is happening? - There is confusion. - Let's check. - These sometimes shoot! - Here we go. - Give me the suitcase. - I told you, it's a hobby to me. It's big! - Still want something? Some cheese? - No thanks. - Don't insist. - What if he's hungry? Can't you see, he has the face of that ... - As? - He has the face of a complimenter. - No thanks. - Jole, tell the doctor yourself. - Please! If you really insist, one more glass of Ruffino. - Would you like a bottle of wine? - No! - Don't pay compliments. - Congratulations to your mom for dinner. - Thanks. This is a dinner, I dare say a snack. But tomorrow evening my wife Italy will make us a lunch with all the trimmings! - She won't want me to come back tomorrow night ... - No, she's here! This house is at your disposal, we are all at your disposal. - I took advantage enough, if you excuse me ... - You want to offend? This is a hospitable house, in the true sense of the word. By refusing our hospitality, it offends the "hospitals" of Europe! - You tell him. - Please stay. - Say it, I hang on your lips. - All right! Good boy! A round of applause to the doctor! Long live the doctor! Now we have a nice coffee and then go to bed. Let's move on to the other environments. I make coffee with my hands. He will have understood that I am Neapolitan, I have a lot of constipation ... Excuse me, I am very familiar with the Neapolitan. - The machine. - Yup. - I open a parenthesis: the service leaves something to be desired. - But no. It is not a service worthy of his person. But you will understand, little salary, I repeat, little salary, half service. - Closed parenthesis. Jole, keep the doctor company. - All right. - Would you like a bottle of wine? - But no. - He keeps it on his bedside table. Don't you want it? Think about it and let me know. Jole, please. - Again. - You are welcome. - Please, take a seat. - After you. - Thanks. You can't say no to his father. It's overwhelming. He doesn't even leave time to explain ... - Maybe he wanted to go to a hotel. - No, on the contrary! For someone used to staying in a hotel all year, ... ... a friendly family, a nest, they are an oasis in the desert of my life. - Do you live alone? - Yup. - Antonio! - What's up? - Who's the gentleman you took to dinner? Shut up, please! That gentleman is the sun of our future, ... ... the glorious dawn of Cavalier Guardalavecchia. - Do you know who he is? - If I ask you ... The ace in the hole, the secret weapon, the promoter! - Who is it? - The one who will give me the promotion. - The inspector general! - Shut up! - What did I say wrong? - Shut up, the enemy listens to us! Damn Guardalavecchia, they turned down the volume, you can't hear it. But I will hear! You can't hang on the wall all day . My career is at stake! And you cover yourself! Who sees us? It's just me you! A matter of habit, you start by standing half naked on the stage ... ... as you did before you married me, then you are half naked at home ... Here we are not in France, here there is censorship! Stop it, Peppino, don't think like a provincial. Come dance, my love! - I'm a primary school teacher. - What a combination, I'm inspector ... Enough, please! Don't qualify, no need! My daughter is like me: serious, honest and selfless. You can be a scoundrel, a thug, ... ... a gentleman, a pimp, but we don't care. We do it out of friendship. For us, friendship is a hobby. We have the hobby in our blood. In the family "we are all obese". - Listen, master. - What's up? - Are you cuckold? - How do you know it? - What is this confidence ?! - A man is sleeping in your wife's room. - I know. - Cuckold and happy! Do you want to finish it? I'll slap you! The room is mine too, I can accommodate whoever I want! Vicious! Luckily I don't sleep in this house of sin! - I'd break your head! - Let alone. - How I slept badly. - Of course, in this house make a triangle! Will you stop making insinuations? - Vicious! - Do not answer! And you "don't give her twine"! She's the one who gets it! I'd put it around his neck! I have a devil for hair! I tremble from how nervous I am! - Please, Mr. Rossi is asleep! - Ah, yes, let him sleep! - Don't let Lomumba bring him coffee . - From who? - Lomumba! - Assunta? - Yes, the girl. Have Jole bring it. - Why from her? - How tough you are! - I do not understand you. He has shown that he has sympathy for our daughter. Did you understand? How should I settle for lunch? Set up like this: agnolotti, pasta, pasta in broth, ... ... appetizer, steak, pasta and beans, ... ... coffee, fruit, cheese and ice cream, or rather, double ice cream! Who cares! Because last night you didn't face at the table ... ... the promotion topic that is so close to your heart? Why do I have an ignorant, belated wife who doesn't understand anything ?! What sin have I done? Did I declare war? No! Did I put the sanctions? No! Am I a tax agent? No! - Because? What did I say? - A lot of bullshit. The inspector might have believed that I had done everything on purpose! - But it was done on purpose. - It must have the appearance of the spontaneous thing. I can already see the scene when he enters the office. "Possible? What are you doing here?", "And what are you doing here?". A hug, a kiss, then he says: .. "Men stand still, the mountains meet". He smiles, I the languid eye , then the pleasantries ... He says: "But look at the case", and I: "It is the case of the macaroni case". Did you understand? Late! - Good morning, colleagues! Napoleon, do you want a safe terno? - Maybe! Played: advancement, pay rise and anger! The anger that you eat someone! I laugh at it! Bravo Mr. "Cocacola"! Colabona! He took out my chair, he made the state tap! I only did it so as not to make antics in front of the inspector! As long as you're sitting in that chair, it's all a joke! Look'! When your superior enters, stand up! - Should I get up in front of a colleague? - Connect, but superior! Superior by culture, by birth and by wealth! - I'm above 100%! - Don't touch me, don't hurt me! - It hurt me here! - It was a lapse of time. - The inspector general will decide! - She makes me laugh! - I laugh! - "Laugh, clown!" - The inspector general has already decided, unaware! - How do you know? I know everything. What do we do with the armchair? - You sit down. - Ah, give up! - No, let's dot the "i" s. - I'll remove the dots! - And I'll put them back, because I have to talk! - You are renouncing! - Not at all! - Admit it! - We'll see who we have left! - We'll see, dear surveyor! - I'm not a surveyor, I'm a commercial expert ! - But stop it! For twenty years he says he perished and never perishes! Perish once and for all and get out of the way! Do me the pleasure! - Good morning. - Who is she? How dare you enter the room of an acting official ?! - I'm ... - Shut up! Get out and be announced! - But I ... - Go away! Get announced! - Sure. - Go! - You're right, I let myself be announced. - Get announced! - I let myself be announced! Go out! - What's he laughing at? - Nothing. - Laugh, laugh. - I laugh! "The one who laughs last laughs well." Ready? Italy, it's me, your husband. Listen, are you asleep? Ah, did he get up? Good. Please, breakfast: bread, butter, jam, coffee and milk. I recommend, the sandwiches that are with oil. As soon as he comes out, let me know. Hello. - Doctor Matteo Rossi. - Come on. - You want both safe? - Maybe! - Liquidation and dismissal. - 32 and 57, thank you! You are welcome. - Permission? - Forward! - Good morning. - Who is she?! - But I let myself be announced. - I told you to get announced! - He did it. - Who?! - The usher. - When?! - Heads! - Come on, what do you want ?! - Let me finish, I'm ... They all start with "I am"! Listen to me, I am Dr. Matteo Rossi! - Not even Giuseppe Verdi had said. Qualify better. - I qualify. I'm the inspector general sent by the company's management! Right now the inspector is eating bread, butter and jam. - And coffee! - Listen, dear, dearest, most lovable Colabona ... How do you know Colabona? Yes, he kindly came to pick me up at the station. This is a hellish plot , a plot against me! Have pity! Have pity! If you don't want to do it for me, do it for my wife and children. - But if he has only one daughter! - I can still have more, right? Have pity! - "Guardalaracchia"! - "The old". - Stop with these hysteria! These are the hysteria of an upright official , believe me! My characteristic notes speak for themselves! Unfortunately they cannot speak, because they have not been found. This is another plot against me! Stop it! Even those of Signor Colabona have not been found ! - No? - There c'era "Colabona"? - The "scolabrodo" ... - Colabona! If you want, I'll tell you, I know them by heart. - Mr. Santoro loved me. - What did he say about me? - Turkish things. - In fact, the father was born in Constantinople. - He wrote the notes in Turkish! - None of this matters. - But how? - I regulate myself following my personal impressions. I'll be based on what I see. What I saw today is not in your favor, Guardalavecchia. You are a hysteric, a madman, a maniac! In work as in life it takes kindness, sweetness, tact! Touch! Touch! Touch, touch ... See, dear Rossi of the same name ... In life as in work it takes gentleness, kindness and tact. One must never get caught up in anger. But when a gentleman like me is faced with a scoundrel, ... .. fetentone, pimp, who eats, drinks and usurps and does not qualify, ... .. I don't care about kindness, sweetness and tact! Do you know what I do ?! First of all, I take off the supplies! - Go away! - How dare you ?! - Usurper! Go away! - What did I do ?! - Out! The stuff of this! - Antonio, wait ... - But why? - Out! - It's a shame! - Who knows what happened! - The triangle is over, huh ?! - Shut up! - You pretend to be an inspector! - I'm a school inspector! - Go to school! - No, no! My stuff! - Antonio, calm down! - The suitcase! At least say hello to your daughter! - Antonio, calm down! - This is mine! - Your daughter is crying! - And the father doesn't laugh! Here is who laughs, my bitter enemy ! Joker! - He's your friend! - Now it isn't anymore! Joker! - You could ruin it with this reputation. - I want to ruin it! Laugh because you think you have the promotion in your pocket! The one who laughs last laughs well! In the end I want to "mess up"! I don't stop in front of obstacles! He who hesitates is lost! - A Guardalavecchia tells you! - Antonio, are you crazy? Collaborate! - Good morning. - Good morning, Commander! - I'm pleased with you, already at work. - Always early. - It's been years! - Please, take a seat. - What am I saying? Shines! Bilustri! - You are welcome. - And she? - I sit here. This pleases me. I didn't get a good impression yesterday . He's right! Let me tell you, you are right! Yesterday I was nervous, and today I am too! I'm always nervous! - Why? - I should talk, but ... - Talk. - Can I make you a confidence? - Tell me, Guardalavecchia. - A danger hangs over us. - No! - Yup! - No! - Yup! There is a jinx in this office. I don't mention names, but it's right here. Junk is a superstition, gypsy stuff! - He does not believe it? Will have evidence. - There are no jetters! This is not a bad guy. He comes from a family of bad guys. He's a hereditary jinx. The grandfather, good soul, was on board the "Titatic" as a sailor. You know what happened, a misfortune. Only the grandfather was saved. Then he landed in Messina and said: "What a beautiful city!". - That night, Messina earthquake. - No ... - Don't you believe it? One day he went to bathe in Casamicciola. Do not create complexes, they must have been coincidences. Do you call them coincidences? One today, one tomorrow, in the end there are too many. I don't believe it, but if you want we can remove Horse from his room. Horse no. Besides, a horse is always handy. But then you want to allude to Cola ... Don't mention it, for heaven's sake! A catastrophe happens here! - Good morning. - Good morning. This is all nonsense, get back to work. - Good morning, Commander. - Good morning. - Will you allow me a phone call? - Do you also call early in the morning? - I sow during the day and harvest at night! - Quite right. Ready? Tatiana! "Horse I am"! That tile! He almost broke my neck! - Careful, maybe the shelf falls! - How scary! One day he falls. I 've been saying this for twenty years but no one listens to me. All right, "loving". So what should I do with this practice? - Has it been signed? - Yes sir, "it was initialed". - When? Now now! - Now now! - Horse, take her from there! - Horse, take her from there! - Horse ... - Horse ... - What's up? - Nothing. - Were you looking for me? - Oh yes. - Take it to the antique dealer Tommasi. - The deaf? Yes, but now! Walk! - Guardalavecchia. - Commands? - Come on a moment. - Immediately. - I had to completely redo the practice of Anapi! - Wow! Was she escaped from her? - No! - And by whom? - From Colabona. - Here is Colabona. - Good morning, inspector! - Did you prepare a file for the Anapi? - It's not my business. It was full of mistakes! May it never happen again! - Clear ?! - Clear? - An inkwell! - Immediately. Attention, it could get stained. - He spotted it! - But ... - What did I tell you? - It does not matter. Where is a sink ?! - In the hallway! Bad practices, stains ... Nothing works here! This shelf can also fall! - He hurt himself? - Inspector! - COLABONA, DON'T TOUCH ME! - Don't touch it! - DO NOT TOUCH ME! Watch out for the tile! He dropped it! Unfortunate! - I'll help you! - Don't worry about me anymore! - I wanted to remove the stain. - Let it go! I told you, it's a power! Touch this, I always carry it, since I've been with him! Couldn't he have chosen another place? To the sea, in this weather? At least here we are sure that his father will never come. His father became an obsession. The other day, when Elvira called me by phone, ... .. I seemed to go crazy, it had never happened to me! There was dad, I couldn't speak. You know how you feel about him. I am not to blame if he believed me someone else. Pay no attention to it, that's how it is, but someday it will pass. Someday ... When? I can not take it anymore! I need ... to see her, to talk to her ... always. Mr. Rossi, but then you ... - Yes it's her? - Yup! Oh God! I'm happy! - What do I do? I kiss you! - Not here, someone might see us. Why not here? It's me, you and the sea ... Come on, guys, it's raining soon. No, let me get off! - What do I do with this practice? - Take her from there. - Yet? - Take her to protocol! He only knows how to telephone females! It is a donkey called Horse! - Good boy! - There's the antique dealer. - There is the deaf. - Ah, yes ... - Do you have to tell him something? - No, you serve him. - Do I serve him? To what do I owe the honor of this morning pain in the ass ? I can't believe my ears! - Your ears did you bad. - Repeat it! - It's useless, you are so deaf as a bell! - But no, I can hear it! - No! - Yup! - How is it possible? - Quite possible. - He's so deaf that he doesn't even feel a headache ... - Now I can hear it! - Do you want proof? - Yup! - Look there. That's enough! I've always been insulted in this office! But I will never go back! I have to thank your usher who gave me these glasses! Do you hear with your eyes and see with your ears? Don't be a fool! I feel it! - Who gave them to you? - The usher. - Napoleon? - Yup! - Long live Napoleon! Always live! - Long live Napoleon! # This deaf man went stupid! # She laughs under that dirty nose mustache she keeps on her muzzle! She is a Judas! It should be called "Colagiuda"! - What's going on here ?! - And he! - Mr. Guardalavecchia treats customers badly! - I?! Did you hear how the deaf man screamed? The customer is sacred! - You are a layman, you should never open your mouth! - Because? When he speaks, something happens! I didn't mean to say it, but it pushed me! - Oh yes? - He spoke three times this morning! - So? - Three cataclysms have happened! - The tile, the shelf and the ink! - Excuse me, inspector! I need to put the dots on the "i"! - Do you consider me a jinx? - That didn't mean that. - You think so too! - It's not true! - Of course! It's true?! - The facts speak for themselves! - Did you hear ?! - It's not true! But he believes it! I can see it from the face! Well then I'm jinx! Who knows, maybe I will agree! But be careful, where I pass, ruin passes! - I made Santoro die! - Calm down. He wants something? - No! Inspector, do you pamper him? Such an individual should be turned away! NO, I MUST BE PAMPERED! EVERYONE MUST PAMPER ME! - We'll give you the promotion! - No! - I better be a jinx! Pass "the cuddle", I stand! But the promotion is not! - The promotion yes! - He wants to give it to him because he fears it! - The ink, the tile, the shelf ... - I made it all up! - What did you invent ?! - If you're jinx, kill the inspector! But she is crazy! I am still young! - I would kill her, but ... - I want to live! Jetters have tremendous power ! They break! They break! - Break something! - I'd gladly break something! - Break the window! - I'll break it! Sorry, I was waiting for the delivery of 7 ebony coffins from Valtellina. This promotion has become an obsession. Look how we have to talk to each other. They fight and we get in the way. Ambition, the desire for power made them become enemies. - Teresa! - See you tomorrow. - Hello. - Italy! - Here I am! - Long last! Who were you talking to? - With nobody. - You were talking to Guardalavecchia's wife ! - Yes, it's true! What do we have to do with the quarrels of you men ?! That's not a man, he's a poisonous snake! Don't go around like that! Cover up! That's not a man, he's a poisonous snake! It compromised my promotion, which was almost safe! I was holding the promotion! Doctor Rossi had taken a liking to me, I almost called him "you". - I would have called him "Matteo"! - Is his name Matteo Rossi? - Yup. - Because? Do you know him? - No, no, so ... it seemed to me ... - I thought there was nothing wrong with that. - Not bad, bad! To Colabona's relatives, family members, related, collateral, ... .. legitimate and natural ascendants and descendants , we must not speak! And me and the phones! I do not stop neither at the first, nor at the second nor at the third obstacle! As they say in Chiavari: "Whoever stops is lost!". I'll stop! Let alone! Isonzo Bar? I need to speak to Cavicchioni. - Cavicchioni! - Yup! - On the telephone! Play, but do not steal because I will run you! So to speak. Thanks. Ready? Yes I am! Good evening, Cavalier Guardalavecchia! - Listen to me. - You are. All right. But don't I end up at the police station again? Leave it to me, I'm a pro of these things. OK Bye. Adua! I have something for you! Hey! Deficient! I want to earn you a few lira and you lead me? Was he supposed to come right here ?! It seems to me a "teasing"! Does it bother you? I don't laugh at anyone, I just do "po-po". In this office you can no longer do "po-po" ?! And where should I do it ?! - Cavalier Colabona, a lady is asking about you. - Of me? - It's her, isn't it? - I'm not expecting anyone. If you have to talk to her, talk to her! Should we send her away? - He says he has to speak to you personally . - With me? Talk to us! What does he look like in front of a lady? Let her in. - Look ... - Leave it to me, I 'm a man of the world. Colabona, I'm leaving, if not ... I'm leaving, otherwise I disturb. Good luck. Good luck. - Permission. - Forward. - Please take a seat. - Thanks. - Lady or young lady? - Miss. - Congratulations then. - Thanks. - What can I help you with? - Permit? - You are welcome. If you have to ship, there's the office on purpose. - Ah, fun! - So, tell me. So, I came to ... Oh, how hot it is here! Do you feel hot? Maybe I'm used to it, but it doesn't seem so hot. It's terrible! Allows? - That's better. - You are welcome! - Tell me, I have no time to waste! - Ah, yes, so ... - Oh, but it's really stifling! - What are you doing ?! I take it off, I just can't stand it! - Miss! - Because? - But we are not in Africa! - But when she's hot, don't you undress? - But he gets naked! - When I'm hot I take off everything! That's better! - Can you open that window? - No, miss! - Do you know what I do? I undress. - But there's the inspector! It is so hot! Why doesn't she get naked too? No! Mamma Mia! There's the inspector, please! No, but what does it do? Doctor Colabona! Oh, it tickles me! Collaborate! - Inspector ... - This is beyond limits! - Who is this ugly gentleman? - It's the inspector! How disgusting, my gentlemen! - Is he crazy ?! - I don't like it, you're cuter! - I do not know her! - Of course? We're engaged! - You are a married man! - I swear, I've never seen her! - Even if he's married, let's go to Mexico, right? - I have a family! Are you afraid of him? Instead when there was the other, every Saturday ... - On Saturday! - Lie! It is an attack on my integrity! - Horse, put an end to this scandal! - With pleasure! - Believe me! - I believe what I see! - Damn! Horse! How dare you ?! Go away, you! - You're a real liar! - You owe me an explanation! - Yes, inspector! I am as good as a lily! Leave me alone! I do not know her! It's a Guardalavecchia attack! All right. Horse, dress the lady. Send me Guardalavecchia! - Come to the office, Colabona! - Yes, "con la bona"! - What are you saying? - You dress the lady! - Come to my office! She's coming to my office, right ?! Forward! - I want to get dressed, it's cold! - That's fine, miss. - I'll help you. - What are you doing ?! - The inspector wants Guardalavecchia! - Come, "most loving"! - These are safe numbers! - Cavaliere Guardalavecchia, from the inspector general! - Flight! - Come in and sit down! - Where is it? - There! - Yes sir. - Mr. Guardalavecchia! - Yes sir! - Mr. Colabona says he never met that woman. - Never! - Let me talk! - Let him talk! - And I believe him! - That's good, it's a human case. No, I don't believe there are human cases! Tell me the truth: is there under your hand? Do you think I would have put my hand under But when he wanted to pass me off as a jinx, he put it there! And she instead gave the deaf glasses! That's enough! What it was, it was! From today I will be very strict with you! The fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this headquarters occurs in days . The great officer Amilcare Pasquetti will take part in the party, ... .. or the general manager and owner of this company! And to all of you present in this glorious venue, ... .. who saw me for years sitting at a table in quality ... Adventitious. As a simple adventitious. An affectionate greeting goes to all of you. My unconditional embrace ... .. also go to those who, while not sitting in the offices, ... .. they take care of our merchandise on ships, trains and planes! I would be grateful if you tried to pay a dutiful homage ... .. to our customers! It is not in vain to say that he has made our motto his own! Ditta Pasquetti, perfect transport! Enough, you confuse me! - Teresa! - Matteo! Then it's you! I have aged a little, but you have remained as beautiful as then. - It's been years ... - Come on, Teresa, let's sit down. - Attention, my husband ... - Your husband? - Yup. - You are welcome. - Thanks. And his wife? - No, she's an employee. - Pleasure. I don't understand why my sister hasn't arrived yet. - Did you bring your sister? - He lives here, he would never leave Naples. - Natural. - It's romantic, full of poetry. - Yes, it's a romantic city. - I was talking about my sister. - Excuse me. - You are welcome. - Would you like some ice? I would appreciate it, if it were possible. Please. - Are you happy with him? - He loves me , and I love him. But I have not forgotten you. I remained a bachelor. - Really? - Yes. - Did you do it for me? - Yup. Why didn't you wait for me? I've been waiting for you all night, but you didn't come. - It was our first love date. - Ah, yeah ... That night, on my way to you, the Germans took me. What a night, that night! What a blow! I did not know this. But I've been waiting for you. Why didn't you wait for me before getting married ?! I could not remain a spinster! - Antonio, eat. - I have certain nerves ... - Why? - Look who Teresa is talking to. - With the inspector general. - Does it seem like nothing? - What's up? Colabona 's wife is seducing the inspector, ... .. to get the promotion for her husband! - Colabona sent "la bona"! And who am I sending? - I'll go there! - I am a Guardalavecchia, not Colabona! - Then I'm off! We can start over, can't we? - What are you saying? Now I am a lady. - Exactly. - Matteo! I'm sorry I missed your speech. But the third program carried some wonderful Shakespearean pages. - I see. - Excuse me, Mr. President! Meet an excellent official, Cavalier Guardalavecchia. - Thanks. - Pleasure. - Please, lady. - You're welcome, miss. - Did I make a gaffe? - Yeah! - It does not matter. - You know, sometimes ... - It happens. Aren't they married yet? Now he has made the gaffe! - The gaffe? - Another gaffe! - A big gaffe! - A "gaffone"! - No ... - Sorry. - I'm Giulia Pasquetti, your sister. - Ah ... - The sister! - How long? - As? - Of course, a sister is born with her brother. Excuse me. - Miss! Has such a beautiful young lady not found her soul mate yet? It's a beautiful compliment that I really appreciate! A compliment to my sister is a passport to my friendship! - I do not understand. - A passport ... - For esteem and friendship. Thank you thank you! The young lady is not only beautiful, I dare say she is even ... - Are you offended if I say this? - Please. - Even divine! - Very nice. - I am angry. I don't mind his poetic vein at all. - Not to be outdone by my colleague ... - Colabona, please! It is not necessary, any compliment would be superfluous. - I should tell you something. Dear, I leave you in good company. - Great! - Permission, sister. - Colabona! Pay no attention to it, he's an idiot. Excellent employee, but deficient. Wrong practices, commits gaffe ... He should be punished! - I'll talk to my brother, he never says no to me. - Oh yes? If I wanted to, instead of punishing him I could get him promoted. - Then nothing was understood! - Did I say something wrong? With that mouth he can say anything he wants. But if anyone needs to be promoted, that's me, Miss Pasquetti! - Call me Giulia. - If you allow, I'll call her Juliet. - Oh! - And his name? - For her, I'm Romeo. Yes, a little "maturotto," a Romeo of the territorial, but valid. That's not it, age doesn't matter. - Juliet meets Romeo ... - It's a sign of destiny. - God, it's hot. - Let's go freshen up in the garden. Be careful, there are some holes. They do it on purpose, it's kind of a hobby. As you can see, this garden is a morgue. What a beautiful night, wonderful, starry lunar! It seems like a night made especially for lovers. - I don't believe in love anymore. - Oh, no? - I have loved only once in my life. - Oh yes? - A Shakespearean actor, a superior man. - A marshal? - No, an actor. - Ah, sorry. A great interpreter of the poet, and a poet himself. His voice was music, his words poetry. - Fiance? - More! - Ah! I loved him without inhibitions, beyond social conventions! - Yes! - Beyond love, beyond death! - Is dead? - No! - I live? One day he went out to buy cigarettes. He never came back. - He must have found the closed tobacconist. - What are you saying? - Sometimes they close. She doesn't smoke, otherwise she would know that sometimes tobacconists close. - We talked in verse. - Even weekdays? - Always! - You know Shakespeare. - We called him William at home. "To be or not to be? That's the problem!" My problem only you can solve. The rest is silence. - Oh yes, silence. - Silence. - The second part is better. - Silence is golden. The silence of my heart, which has been silent for some time, who ... - Huh? - Who! - Who? - Who will ever make him talk ?! - What? - My heart! - I! - She? - Yeah. Will he be able to dedicate himself only to me? But are you free? In a certain way, yes. We are all slaves of need! "There's something rotten in Denmark!" Mah! - But she is unconstrained. - I'm in a "blind link". Not anymore, I will take you from the sea to the shore. - From...? - From the sea to the shore! - To look for "the sea in the egg"! You Romeo, I Juliet! We will relive the balcony scene! - When? - Tonight. - Where are you? - You will easily find the house. - It is in the Veronese style, after Portici, in the countryside. - But it's a lot of money! - Your tastes are exquisite! - The gentlemen are served. " Whoever has never felt a wound laughs at scars ." But slowly, what light do I see from that balcony? That window is the East, and Juliet the promotion! Juliet! Juliet! - Juliet! - Romeo! Oh, Juliet, drop the ladder! Sit down instead, and don't be in a hurry. But where should I sit, if there is no sgabel here? Sit on that slope, or speak at the foot. I'll be favoring all of a sudden, standing up from below! - What are you asking? - I ask if you love me. - Oh, si, v'amo go. - "reckless youth of luck." Yes, I love you. But I came to the balcony to tell you not to be imprudent. My brother rightly suspects. And last night, more than one employee smiled a smile of irony. I don't care if someone has already had fun, I want you to be mine soon. - You propose to me then to be lovers. - We are not the only ones, there are many. But will you make me your bride one day? I can not! How dare you marry a humble employee who is always penniless? - We could make some sacrifices. - Better get me head of office! "A gloomy cook, a little pepper head." Your love is interested then. My Juliet, you have misunderstood! I love you in every way, and you know it! - This love can get us in trouble. - It doesn't matter, I'll give you my heart. It is too little for great love. Besides the heart I want everything else. - Want the offal? Tell me, I'm quick. - Giulia! - My brother calls me, what a cancellation. - Shall I go up to the little room? - Please don't, it's not fair! - Where there is danger, there is more taste! Anyway, we'll see you elsewhere tomorrow. - Already I'm all fire. - It's a very safe, secluded place. Tomorrow, with my ticket, you will divert to where the hotel is located. - And then? - Tomorrow night at last you will know ... - What? - Do you want to know now? An advance? How good is cheese with pears. - Giulia! - I have to go. See you soon my love. - Health. - Thanks. - Goodbye, Juliet. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Juliet. - Goodbye. - Juliet ... - I understand, bye! - Do not get angry! Words, fiction and sneezing ... What do you have to do for this promotion! There is a hotel on the outskirts that is ideal for a tête-à-tête. - Reserved, quiet, better than a garçonnière. - Who cares? It is called Villa Lolita. Here is the address and telephone number. Keep it well, I am a serious and above all honest man! Give it to me, I'm an honest and serious man too , but sometimes ... How do you say? We are men, we belong to this sex! - I want to get married white. - With the veil, I promise you! Our escape, our romance , must be a fiction. - Your parents should catch us in one ... - In one? - In a hotel room! - Mario! Faced with the fact that they believe it is complete, they will give us their assent. - What are we gonna do in a hotel room all night? - Jokes. - Thing? - I know a lot. Yours will surprise us before midnight. Yes, I promise you, it will be romantic. Si, cast. Chaste. We will remember together the long night of '43, when we don't ... If you promise me we'll be as naïve as then, I accept. Oh, dear, dear ... You make me awfully happy. Yes. Bye, bye, bye ... Hi dear. Dear Horse! I made her come here for a very delicate thing. "Man of the world I am." You see, I'm alone, a bachelor, here in Naples I don't know anyone. I am intimate with certain terrible females : Albanians, Tunisians ... One moment, Horse. How to say? I have the woman. - What I miss is ... - The alcove. - Exactly. Quiet, Commendatore, I know a very comfortable place. No, look, Horse ... This is a married woman, I don't want to compromise her. I already understood that. "I'm a 'dolce vita' technician." At Villa Lolita, they don't even ask the ladies for documents. - Not even the documents! - Dear Cavallino! I don't understand how my parents will know where to come and surprise us. It's called Villa Lolita, very misunderstanding! My grandfather used to go! Tonight you will leave a letter in which you naively say where you are going. - Yours will rush. - I can't write a letter like that. Yes, you are a teacher, you can only dictate. But I'm the inspector. This time the inspector will dictate to the teacher. Here you are, I'm very organized. This is the pen. Are you ready? Then: "Dear dad, I am writing to you and my hand ..." - # It almost trembles ... # - "It almost trembles ..." - So, knight, what should I do? - Wait a moment. - Do you know where you need to take her? - To Miss Juliet ... Shut up, idiot! Wait, I'm coming out! Ah, it's that of the attack on the station! Ah, rascal! He wants to get to promotion with his brother's sister! We will see it, Guardalavecchia! - President, here they are! - Where am I? - One moment... - President, here they are! - There is nobody! - In the name of the president, come out! - Out! - What did you say? - Out! - Out! - There are not. - She's kidding me! - No ... - There's nobody here! - Why? - He should know! - I humbly ask. - You should know! But if it's an infamy , I'll send it to Sardinia, do you understand ?! No, President. If it is an infamy against my sister, I will send her to Sardinia! - I'd got it right. - Understood? - It's true! - No! - It's true! - No! - There is a song that haunts me. - Do you think it's time to sing ?! Did I let you read the blotting paper ? Have you read it? Yes, I'm not deaf! I have read it, but it is not enough! "Cuckoo"? Love? Juliet? Giuliettuccia? Juliet, where are you? Busy? You can see that it hasn't arrived yet. He confides in me. - Good evening. - Good evening Miss. - Mr. Rossi's room. - Room 43, first floor. - Thanks. Beautiful shy of Antonio, ... .. my sublime love, sweetest passion, ... .. please talk to your brother, let me have the promotion. I am training, and this is not coming. I speak to blanks! - Good evening, I'm Doctor Rossi. - Room 43, first floor. - I asked for a cold dinner and champagne. - Sure. - A lady will have to come. - He's already in his room. - Just me. - Here. - Thanks. Champagne no! Teresa! Teresa! Teresa... Teresa, are you here? - Teresa? - I'm here. - Where is it? - Here! Ah ... love! Let's hide in another room. I am sure to surprise them. - Colabona! - They must be here! - Where do you want to drag me? - Haven't you figured it out yet? The president with Colabona! How did the damned know? Anathema to you, Colabona! Cursed! To you the "bad Easter"! - No, Matteo! - My love! - Matteo! - Teresa! Please don't insist! Do you remember that long night of '43, '44, '45, '46, '47 ... - Where is 44? - And ask me? - And then! - We're out of 44 now! Let's hide in 43! Matteo, he's my husband! That kills us! Oh God! - You?! - She?! - My hat! - So, let's go in? - Yes. - Ouch! - He hurt himself? - No. - I heard "Ouch". Let's stay here, it seems to me the right place. I don't know how I got persuaded to come here! - I was a fool! - It's true. - Do not touch me! - I didn't touch her. Doorman, please room 43. Did you play? - I have no alarm in my pocket, it was the phone. - Ah, there he is. Ready? Adulterers are in the bathroom. Okay, okay. - I'm in the bathroom. - I'll wait for you here. - The two of us in the bathroom! - I have no will. - No, his sister and the concubine are in the bathroom! Hide inside! Shut up, please! - Out! - As? - Out! - You know, I don't understand ... The president said: "Out"! - No! - Inspector ... - Rossi, are you here? What are you doing ?! - I live here. - Here? - And who is there with you in there? - As? - Who's in there ?! - Speak clearly! - Who is there? - Nobody. - I don't believe you. Let us pass. - It is not possible! - Colabona, execute! - I run! - But that's my daughter! - Pope ! - My daughter, what are you doing here ?! Here is the great mother scene! Throw your daughter into the inspector's arms! - Lei ce I'ha with you? Stia zitto tool! - Lenon ?! He threw his wife into the inspector's arms ! I'll show you! - Do not move! - Here she is! - Pepper! - Pope! - Pepper! - Pope! - I want to know something! - Pepper! - Pope ! - Cover up! - Peep a horn! - Two horns, you are a cuckold! Stop with your hands! - You stand still with your hands! Distorted father! - Indicator light! - Paraninfo! You will pay for it! - You will pay it to me! - If anyone has to pay ... - It's him. - What do I have to do with it? And he! Inspector of my boots! The corrupter of minors! - I don't know your daughter! - I arrived on time. - He's not involved. - He wanted to get my daughter drunk! - He wanted to get my wife drunk! - Your wife does not need to get drunk! - How many bottles! - It was a good memory! - Nice memory! - Nothing happened! Do we want to laugh at it and end it with tarallucci and wine? Wait a minute, if anyone has to say "enough", it's just me! - Chiang Kaishek spoke! - You have to justify yourself! - I? - He wanted to seduce my sister! - Shame on you! - My Italy! - Let's put it on patriotism! - Don't think about your daughter's honor! Let's not digress! They shot! The Indians are coming! They hurt me, I have some holes. Please don't digress! She said Guardalavecchia and my sister had an appointment! - In room 44! - It's not true! Most veiled lady of my heart, welcome to this love nest. - Jole! Pope! - Mario! - Did I arrive on time? - What do you want? - Your daughter's hand ! - In the meantime, I'll give you mine! - Antonio! - Pope ! - Sorry, is Horse here? - We have the donkey, if you keep it! - Here's my sweetie! Hello! Pepper, while you were singing the song to me you were betraying me! - Send this ugly lady away! - It's not true! - Permission! - Remove these flowers! - Yup... I am fed up! You are two hypocrites, two liars! This is to the detriment of the company, but I will never allow it! For me nothing else exists! Pasquetti company, perfect trips! I understand Sardinia, but I didn't understand why we dressed like that. As usual, he doesn't understand anything. When we land in Sardinia the Sardinians will say: "They belong to us", ... .. and they will take a liking to us. - Do you plan to stay a lot? - No! He who hesitates is lost! Farewell, Italy!
