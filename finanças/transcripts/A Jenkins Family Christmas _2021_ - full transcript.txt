Hmm. It is T-minus two days before Christmas, Daddy, and my family's coming home, coming together to celebrate you on our favorite holiday. ♪ Five golden rings ♪ Four calling birds, three French hens ♪ ♪ Two turtle doves ♪ And a partridge in a pear tree ♪ Mama's special recipe. Lord, give me your strength today. Bless me with your patience to deal with my family, for they know not what they do. Lord, I can't believe Daddy's not with us this Christmas. Please send your loving angels to be with this family as we get through this first one without him. Protect us and guide us as only you can. In your precious name we pray. Amen. James. Come on, now, I have cooked, cleaned, and prayed, and you're still not down? Do you hear me? Our children will be here any minute! Don't let me come up there and get your ass! Lord, forgive my mouth today. I told you, I'm gonna need as much patience as I can get. James Mabry, I have never known you to be this late, fussing around like that. What's wrong with you? Not getting it right, Baneatta. The getting ready on time to greet your family, or your sermon? Oh, man. Honey, you have been speaking to this congregation seven months now, and you get better and clearer and more powerful every weekend. But this is Christmas. And your daddy's Christmas Eve sermons... They were something. People would come from all over to hear his sermons. Hmm. You know, first time, first Christmas I heard him, I thought God had given up on me. But I heard him that night, and I realized I had just stopped listening. - He was something. - Yeah. But you're special in your own way. Daddy knew it; that's why he gave you the church. And I know it too. Mm. You have your title yet? No. No. That's part of the problem. How am I... How am I supposed to top, "While they're at home, waiting on Santa, we're in here..." both: "Praising Jesus!" Oh, see? See? It's a classic. Man. - It is. - Mm. But you'll find your own. Yeah. Your sister here yet? Would the house be so quiet if she was? I can't be worried about you two strangling each other out in the parking lot. Well, you need to talk to her... - Wait, Miss. - Not me. My point is, Miss Baneatta, I need you to promise me you're gonna walk into that church with a positive attitude. None of us need a repeat of the funeral. Mm-hmm. Baneatta. I promise. Good. To do my best. Lord, have mercy. All right. Your best is a start. Now... Can I have one more kiss before I get ready? - After you brush your teeth. - Oh, Lord. Ooh, what-what-what's that? Whoa, I got that booty. I got that booty. I touched your booty. Hello? This is Louis Lee, your father Bernard's attorney. Oh, uh, hello. Good morning, Mr. Lee. I thought we had already handled everything with Daddy's will. He left us this house, his car. Was there more? Well, yes. There was one more part your father instructed us to wait to execute until the holiday. I'm calling to let you know that he left an additional inheritance for the entire family. But only if... now, you hear me... The entire family comes together for Christmas. He chose that day for a reason. It was his favorite holiday. Wherever we were, whatever was going on in our lives, we'd always come together. This should be easy, then. Great. Um, our entire family's coming today for Christmas. I'll need to see for myself. Of course. Come by tomorrow afternoon before church service. Do you have the address? I do. Good. We'll be here. I sure hope so. Like I said, we will be here. Until then. Oh, Lord. Um. Excuse me, is this the... The Jenkins home? Sure is. Are you Baneatta Jenkins? Yes. Uh, this is for you. Oh. Thank you. May I ask who it's from? - It's from me. - Oh, do I know you? I'm sorry. I just... I... Been envisioning this moment for so long, and I thought it was gonna be easier... Would be in my mind. Okay. You're as beautiful as I imagined you would be. I don't understand. I'm your sister. Oh, you have me confused with someone else. No, Bernard was... He was my daddy too. I... I didn't know him. I mean, not... Not like I imagine you do. My mother kept who he was a secret from me, but when the cancer... It, um, came for her quickly. And it was just the two of us. And at the end of the day, she... She just didn't want me to... To be left alone in this world. So she told me who he was. Who you all were. The only family I have left. And I know this must be a shock for you, all those years past, all the years that we could have known each other, but I'm here to... To get to know him and all of you on his favorite holiday. 'Cause I mean, what's the point of being alone anymore when I have family? Right? Anyway, um, I'm staying downtown at a hotel across the street from the Fox Theatre, but... I was really hoping to be a part of the Jenkins family Christmas. Well, you were hoping wrong. This is a family affair, and I do not know you. You are not welcome here. You need to go back to where you came from. Tell that to Louis Lee. What did you say? The lawyer. Daddy's lawyer. He called me, too, Baneatta. He said that Daddy... That our daddy... Left us something behind... An inheritance. And the only way we could claim it is if the entire family were together at Christmas. The entire family. All his children. Which I just explained includes me. Look, I just drove in from Raleigh to find my family. I'm sorry I couldn't have been more help. Who was that? James, put some pants on. This is not one of your Zoom calls. But I... All right, be like that. ♪ No need to let a good bottle of wine to go waste. Oh, my baby. Hey, Ma. Hello, Kenneth. It is, like, two days until Christmas. How you holding up? I was all right till a couple of minutes ago. Oh, no. What's... what's wrong? Well, no one informed me we were gonna have guests, and you know how much I like to prepare everything. Kenny, you told me your mom invited me. Hey, remember, I told you about my friend... Logan. Well, he's here now, so. Come on, Luke. - It's, uh, it's actually Lo... - That's what I said. Hey, so, I know that nobody will ever make it as good as you, but I attempted to make your famous eggnog.

Daddy did go there a lot. Don't just sit there, James. Say something. I know. What do you mean you know? When your daddy died, he confided in me. He did what? I think when your daddy was dying, it finally dawned on him what he had done, Baneatta. He wanted to unite the family and bring everyone together, but he died before we could make that happen. And you didn't think to tell your wife? I was going to tell you. - When? - My love... No, no, don't you "my love" me, James Mabry. You were so shaken up when he died.

Haven't been yourself since your daddy died. ♪ Since you kept this a secret from me, you're gonna go on keeping it. This stays between us. Baneatta, baby, no. No, that is not the way. We have to unburden ourselves of this truth and deal with it. We can't live in a lie. You know the truth now. And this is what your daddy wanted. I don't care what he wanted. If you live this way, sooner or later, God might find a way to push you into dealing with the truth, and you might not like it, Baneatta. You want me to ruin my daddy's name on Christmas? You're taking up the mantle of this church. I don't understand why today, of all days, you want to do this, tarnish his legacy, our family name. The humiliation... Can you imagine? Ha. Don't look at me like that. I didn't expect this vanity and cowardice from you. No, you take that back. Your daddy wasn't perfect, but at least he knew. James. You call yourself a good Christian, but look at all the discord you sow in your own home. You won't open up your heart to this woman, your sister... your sister, who has done nothing to you, and who is alone. And your other sister, Beverly, the one... the one you do recognize, all you do is fight with her, belittle her, and make her feel small. And your own children. - No. - Your own children. You... Do not bring them into this. You are so controlling. Your own son... he's in love. He's in love, Baneatta. And he's still afraid to tell his mama. How does that sit right with you? We're all human.

So don't be accusing me of not supporting you. I love you, Kenny. Then I don't get it. Why don't you like Logan? Okay, first of all, I have been really nice to him. And second of all, if you really want to know, I just don't understand why all your guys have to be white. You have never brought home anyone that looks like us, and I've always wondered about that. Why can't you find happiness within your own race? All right, for the record, I have dated Black guys. Just not long enough for you to meet. And I don't know, I think growing up gay and Black and suppressed, you learn to idolize the things that you can see from inside of your closet, and the other Black boys, they can't see each other from inside of their closet. So... I don't know, our first crushes are the things that are paraded in front of our faces, and that is happy, self-loving, free-spirited white boys. I don't know, without even realizing it, the world conditioned my taste. Whoa. That's something. Okay, but that doesn't mean that I don't love myself or the men that I share skin with, so let's just cut that notion today. Okay? I'm not with Logan because he's white. I am with Logan because nobody makes me happier. Can't you... can you find a way to be happy for me, just this once? Yeah. Thank you. And since we're on the topic of men, am I supposed to keep pretending that I don't notice that Michael's not here? I... I promise, I won't say anything. A couple of weeks after Grandaddy's funeral, I... I came home from work and I found Michael... Banging his new client Melissa in our bed. It happened after my promotion. I started making more money than him, and... It seemed like everything that I did that made me successful made him feel smaller and smaller, until he couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't process it. That he could do that to me... When I was taking care of us, when I wanted us to win. God, I'm so sorry. Simone. He took all of the good parts of me with him. No. No, that's not... That's not true, Simone. No, he didn't. Listen to me. You deserve somebody who treats you like a queen, okay? Somebody who brings you absolute joy. Like Logan brings you. Yes. Yes, yes. Like Logan brings me. Come on. God, if... if you're struggling, you gotta call me. Okay? 'Cause I'm your brother. 'Cause we cannot end up like Ma and Aunt Bev. - No. - No. - No, no, no, we can't. - We cannot. Okay? No, we can't. All right, so let's just be better for each other. Okay? - Let's. - Okay. Okay. I love you. I love you. Give me some of that pie. Deacon Scott just called me. We have a plumbing leak at the church. Sounds bad. We gotta go. Now. - What? Oh, my God. - Mmm, that's good. I know, it's really great, right? Okay. ♪ How bad? You remember that time Miss Ella threw up during Thanksgiving service? Don't remind me. Yeah, well, it's worse than that. Come on. Y'all, stay here. Oh, wow, what's going on? Are we gonna be able to have service, Mama? Hey, Miss J. Have a cookie, Deacon Scott. Yes, ma'am. You know, truth be told, this be a... This be an early treat for me, since I won't be getting much of a, you know, Christmas lunch. You know, uh, just me at the house, you know, no... You know, microwave turkey meal, something like that, by myself. What are you talking about? Surely you'll be celebrating with your people. No, no, ma'am, they, uh, they all gone up to Chicago. You know, I was aiming to go with them, but, uh, got a little busy around here, so, you know, here I am. I insist you come by the house tomorrow. No, no, I couldn't do that. Oh, nonsense. My Daddy treated you like a son. Don't you forget it. You're family. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Hello. Deacon Scott. Hey. Beverly. Hello. I mean, hello. Yeah. - Yes. Yes. - Yeah. Yeah. How you doing? I'm doing just fine, just fine, just fine. Look at you. Too blessed to be stressed. Ooh! Too anointed to be disappointed. Ooh, say what, now? All right. Sure is nice to have you back in town for the holiday. Oh, well, I'm only here for a few days. Yeah. All right. Let me ask you something. Are you... are you a camera? Say what now? 'Cause every time I see you, I smile. - Oh, that's sweet. - Yes. Yes, it's very, very, very sweet. Yeah. Well, hey, I'ma, um, I'ma let y'all go ahead and get out there.

Yes. - Yeah. - All right. - All right. - See you tomorrow. - Uh-huh. Hey, hey... Oh. Heh-heh. Oh, God. I don't remember him being so extra. Oh, he is a good man, and Daddy loved him. Isn't that what you said you wanted? You always think you know what's best for me, but I don't think he's good for me anymore, mm-mm. As much time as you spend in the mirror, I'm surprised you haven't figured something out. What? You are not getting any younger. Time is ticking. That is a good man. Mama, people are starting to get restless. Where are they going? Oh, not all these God-fearing Christians looking for an excuse to go home. Like you can talk. You know what? I have an idea. I don't have time to entertain your ideas. They always make things worse. No, no, no, no, Baneatta, you gotta trust me on this. It's gonna be so good. Merry Christmas, everybody. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, everybody. You know, it's been a long time since my sister and I have sung. Oh, absolutely not. I will let you sing lead. Well, if you insist. Okay. There she goes. Okay. All right.

Um, Merry Christmas. I need my Christmas Eve sermon. And you shall have it. Just give us a few minutes. They need you, James. We don't have a church. You have a congregation, and that is all that you need. People willing to gather and hear the good word of the Lord. These people, our people, they care, they're here, and they are ready. It's a beautiful night. Daddy used to love to walk up these steps every Sunday morning. It's a sign. I know it. You'll stand on these steps and use that mighty voice that God gave you, and people will listen. You'll be wonderful. I know you will. You're right. You're right, Baneatta. But it's so dark. What are we gonna do? Bev, girls, come with me. Deacon Scott, get my robe. ♪ Y'all can't see it from my angle, but you are a most beautiful congregation this evening. You look like fireflies shining your light back on me. Now, I'm gonna be honest with you. I'm gonna be honest with you, I haven't slept much this past week. Becoming your new pastor has been my complete honor. - But... but... but stepping... - Okay. - I say... I say stepping... - All right. - Into Bernard's shoes... all: Yes. - Has terrified me. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh. - You're all right, Pastor. You see, over the past two weeks, I've been racking my brain. You hear me, folk? I say, saints, I've been racking my brain trying to figure out... Figure out what the sermon title gonna be. I was more worried about me than I was feeding this congregation with the mighty word from the Lord. So... so the sermon title this year... The take-home title this year is... Come on. "Ain't No Christmas Without Christ." I say hallelujah! He is heating up now. I say there ain't no Christmas without Christ. Say that to one another. All: There ain't no Christmas without Christ. Hallelujah! All: Yeah! Well, well, well, church. Church, I... I think our service has come to its close. I pray your spirits are as full as mine is. But before we depart the house of the Lord, I must offer these steps to anyone who might want to bring Christ into their life. Know that it is never too late. He is always there for you. - That's right. - Yes, he is. Might there be anyone? No one? Well. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I might have... I might have spoken too soon. Come on up here, ma'am. It's never too late to usher God into your life. Give this brave soul a hand, please. - Amen. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Give us your name. Tell us a little bit about yourself. Hello, everyone. all: Hello. - Merry Christmas. All: Merry Christmas. Hey, who is that, Mama? I, um... well, when I heard about this service, my spirit got real excited. Yes. And I've, um, I've driven quite a ways to be here. And I almost didn't come, but... But my heart told me it was the right thing to do. Praise God. - So I did. - Mm-hmm. I'm Brianna. Brianna Jenkins. I'm... I'm Bernard's other daughter. Oh, hell no! Lord, have mercy. Praise God! Oh, Lord. I didn't mean to cause the family any... Any harm or anything. I just wanted to come here to see my family, to be with them. I mean, 'cause it's been... It's been a longtime dream of mine. But when I went to my sister Baneatta's house earlier to tell her who I was, she turned me away. So I had no other choice but to come here. Kenny, what is happening right now? Uh, you know as much as I do. - Say something. - Listen here, now. I don't know what you trying to pull, but you better stop right now. - Everyone... - No! - Everyone settle down. - No! This is the Lord's house. All are welcome. All are welcome. This is the Lord's house. - No way! - All are welcome. No way! Baneatta, you gave me no choice! Baneatta, stop! You tell her to stop! She's the one trying to ruin Daddy's name the first Christmas without him! - Baneatta, stop! - No! She is lying! I'm not lying! And I know you know it! Tell them, Baneatta! James, please, tell her! - No! - Baneatta, it's the truth! It's the truth! All: Whoa! Baneatta! Did you know about this? Do I look like I knew about this? Did Grandma Rita know about this? She couldn't have. I can't believe you let that woman speak at my Daddy's church without my permission! And I can't believe you would keep the truth from the rest of the family! Would you want someone to do that to you? Ignore you? Erase you, like you don't exist? Her showing up at our church was a final act of desperation. She's in pain, Baneatta, and you contributed to it. I mean, I just preached on being... On being devoted to one another in love, honoring one another above ourselves. That same love applies here, Baneatta! Did you ever stop and put yourself in her shoes? ♪ You can be as mad at me as you want to be, but you better make this right, Baneatta. You better make this right. Don't look at me like that. You don't know what I'm going through. You're right, Mama, I don't. But the thing is, I thought you were better than this. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, right? The crown is heavy on the head. - The... - Bev. The queen... you think that you're the queen. You know what I'm talking about. You know, you want to be the queen, but it's harder than it looks, right? She's ruining Daddy's name. Oh, he did that on his own. Why would he do that to us? To us? To us? You're taking this personal. You're take... he... I loved Daddy. I did. I loved him more than anyone. More than anyone. But you know the difference between you and me? Please enlighten me. I loved him, and he knew that I loved him as he was, as a man. As a man. You've turned him into a deity, into a god. But he's just a man. Imperfect, messy, crazy, just like me, which is why I was his favorite. Ha! Girl. The man loved us, sis. But he was just a man. But the question is... Question is, can you love him now? Now that you know that he's... That he's just... - Like us. - Just like us. Just like us. Exactly. Exactly. You talk about your family a lot, Baneatta. But do you love us as we are? Messy, broken, learning to be better? Of course I do. Sometimes it doesn't feel that way. I'm sorry. I know. I know. I know. And... and Brianna, you're punishing her for something she didn't do. Hasn't she been alone long enough? I was a monster! - Mm. - You... you were. I can't show my face to her again. Oh, you can. - I can't. - Why not? I don't know if I can let her into my heart. You can, and you will. I've known you my whole life. You're my sister. And you can be a big ol' B sometimes, but that's because you want the best for us. I get that. We get that. We love you anyway. You're a good sister, Baneatta. You're a good sister. - I am. - You are. But don't you tell anybody I said that or I will deny it. Tell you what, I'll go with you. Let's go fix this together. As sisters. Sisters. Oh, it's right down here. Mm-hmm. Okay, okay, here we go. Okay. We're here. Okay. ♪ Sister! Can I help you? We'd like you to come to Christmas lunch tomorrow. I'd like you to come to lunch. That's it? No apology? Well, you know what, apologizing is not really her strongest suit. I mean, these are great steps, you know, baby steps all in the right direction. Trust me, girl. An hour ago, you were trying to attack me in front of your whole congregation. I am so sorry about that. You know... All I really wanted was family. Sisters. Be a part of something bigger than me. Or at least that's what I thought I wanted. And then I met you, a Jenkins, and I realized, if that's what family is, I don't want any part of it. Oh. Oh. - Oh. - Come on, let's go. ♪ I know. ♪ He lied about that too. This is calm, Mom. I'm trying my best here. Hi, Logan. Oh, my God. Uh, Mom, I gotta go. Yeah, I... I love you too. Bye. Are you not staying? I'd like to, but Kenny loves his mom, as he should, but she hates me. So I don't know how it could work. Aunt Baneatta is tough. Why do you think I was asking everybody, "Who is this white boy?" I was asking because I wanted the family to see you, acknowledge you, accept you. It was never about your color. It was about how much you meant to my cousin Kenny. That's amazing. I thought you hated me, just like everybody else. No. No, I don't. Um, we're basically family now, but, like, get off me. - Oh, yeah, sorry. - Yeah. LaTrice, this has been such a stressful day. But you somehow just made it a lot better. - Hmm. - Thank you. No sweat, white boy. Let me get some of this butter over here. Yeah. This here. I have... I have not had no cornbread like this. I swear, I'm gonna have to take a nap and come back for some more. Mm-hmm. Y'all think I'm playing. Y'all gonna have to roll me out this house or let me die, 'cause let me tell you something, this... This right here? This is heaven. Okay? You are so sweet, Deacon. Which one of these plates is yours, Bev? Uh, I made the Brussels sprouts. Oh, I should have known. Yep. Sweetest Brussels sprouts I ever seen, I'll tell you that. Yeah. Oh, Deacon Scott, you are too much. You are really too much. That's what they usually say about you. You met your match, Mama. Could you pass that ham, Lenny? His name is Logan, Ma! Do not use that tone of voice with me at my table, Simone. Yes, yeah, it's your house, it's your rules, your table, it's your everything. But this is also Grandaddy's house, where everybody is welcome. God, I, uh, I'm just happy he's not here to see what you turned it into. - How dare you! - Baneatta. Mm. You know, yesterday, an attorney came by the house and told me that Daddy left us an inheritance. What? Well, how much did Daddy leave us? - What did we get? - Nothing. You all get nothing. Nada. All he wanted was for our whole family to get together. But look at this family. What a mess. And you contributed to a large part of it. And let's call it what it is. You ran away that girl Brianna. She's part of our family. And I am in pain, and not once have you noticed, because all you care about is yourself. I can't believe I've been working so hard to make you happy, when you don't care about my happiness! Your image is more important than our well-being. You're the judgiest bitch I know. I love you, Ma, but you need to look at yourself in the mirror before you come at us like that again. You think you are so perfect, when you have been lying to the entire family! You can be a bitch with us, but you know who's not here? Brianna, and that's all on you. Mmhmm. Mm-hmm. Look at yourself in the mirror, just like you said, and you know what? It's your fault, sister. It is your fault. Silence! You're right. I have been taking it all out on you. I trusted Daddy. And I'm just hurt. If he could lie to me like that, to us, then... Anyone can betray us. And that's terrifying. ♪ I didn't know he could be that kind of man. I kept the secret, and that was wrong of me. I didn't want you to know that he was that way. I tried to protect us. I know it doesn't make any sense, but that's the truth. Mama, we're all hurting. Can't you see? The only way to survive is to protect each other, to trust each other. You take care of our pain, but we take care of yours too. And you gotta let us in. You're right, my angel. You are right. But I don't know how to do that. Look, and... and Granddaddy, he made a mistake. Yeah, he messed up. But he's not that one mistake. You've gotta remember that. The reality is, I feel ugly. I don't care what Daddy left behind, his inheritance. What I care about is, I hurt this innocent woman, that I piled more pain onto her life, and she didn't deserve that. I didn't know I could be so cold. Listen to our son, Baneatta. None of us have to be defined my our mistakes. None of us. Mama, I know you sharing that was hard. So I have something I want to get off my chest as well. What is it, baby? Michael and I are getting a divorce. What? Oh, no. Our relationship has been suffering for a while now. But I didn't... I didn't want to be alone. And I didn't want to disappoint you. - Oh. - No. So I tolerated it. I know how much you love him. But when Michael cheated on me... That was the line, and he crossed it. Simone, I am so sorry, baby. ♪ Um, I, um... Mama, I need to tell you something. I am in love with this man. - Kenny... - No, no, no, no. No. I, um, I need you to hear me. I love you. I do.

Unlike Brianna, there are no do-overs here. Can you bring some hot sauce? - I'm sorry, Kenny. - It's fine. Ooh, I didn't see any of this coming. Son, son, you stay where you are. No, Daddy, I can't.

And I only gave you a day to take all this mess in. Daddy would have been proud of you to be so forgiving. It's a Christian value I'm still trying to get right.

Okay. Well. It seems like you managed a Christmas miracle and gathered the whole family. I'm sorry to have brought you all this way, but your services are not needed. I beg your pardon? We don't care for anything you have to offer us. We're good. It took me a while, but I finally realized we have everything we need and more. - Everything. - I'm glad to hear that. 'Cause there is no inheritance. Oh. Say what now? Okay, well, let me explain. There was an inheritance, a small amount of money. However, the amount of money left behind wasn't enough to cover the costs of my fees. I'm sorry, that makes no sense. Your daddy just wanted to bring his girls together, and I was so happy to help. - Wow. - No. Bernard! Bernard! But if I'm being honest, you Jenkins turned out to be a lot of work, so actually, I'm here to collect the rest of my bill. Come on. Uh, this man is crazy. Uh, but, like I said before, I heard the lunch here is to die for, so I'll settle for some leftovers. Man, get on in and have a seat. Let me get you a drink. Well... well, I can help you with that appetite. Oh, no. With the leftovers. I know where the leftovers are. I mean, he's cute and everything, but I am off men for now. Right, LaTrice?
