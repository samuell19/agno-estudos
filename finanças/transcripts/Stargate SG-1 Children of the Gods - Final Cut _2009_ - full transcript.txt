MAN, THIS HANDS'S AS LOUSY AS THIS DETAIL. ALL RIGHT. EVERYBODY, ANTE UP. THAT'S YOU TOO. SEVEN TO THE DEUCE. NOTHIN' THERE. BOSS AND THE EIGHT. NOTHIN' HAPPENIN'. QUEEN TO THE KING. POSSIBLE STRAIGHT GOIN' THERE. EIGHT ON THE EIGHT, AND THE JACK GETS A BOSS. EIGHTS OPEN. AREN'T YOU GUYS AFRAID OF AN OFFICER COMING DOWN HERE OR SOMETHING ? TRUST ME. NOBODY EVER COMES DOWN HERE BUT US. DOES THAT THING ALWAYS DO THAT ? - DO WHAT ? - WHATEVER IT IS UNDER THE TARP. I JUST... SAW IT MOVE OR DO SOMETHING. PROBABLY THE ONLY THING IT EVER DID WAS COST MONEY. YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY RAN OUT OF THAT. BEEN SHIPPING PERSONNEL OUT OF HERE FOR MONTHS. I'M TELLING YOU, THE THING IS MOVING ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE STRAIGHT, JUST FOLD. CAN WE TAKE THAT AS A FOLD ? JUST FINISH THE HAND. SHE'S OUT. [ Rattling ] WHAT THE-- [ Rattling Continues ] WHOA ! I TAKE IT THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. [ Weapons Cocking ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? DON'T TOUCH IT ! [ Gasping, Breathing Heavily ] - [ Weapons Cocking ] - HOLD YOUR FIRE ! IDENTIFY-- HOLD IT ! IDENTIFY YOURSELF ! [ Gasping ] JAFFA ! KREE ! TEAL'C ! KREE ! [ Drops Gun ] GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME ! LET HER GO ! [ Automatic Weapon Fire ] [ Automatic Weapon Fire Continues ] [ Yelling ] - [ Shouting In Foreign Language ] - WE'RE UNDER FIRE DOWN HERE ! - WE NEED-- - [ Grunts ] [ Yelling Continues ] [ Groans ] TEAL'C-- [ Foreign Language ] GO ! GO ! [ Men Shouting ] [ Weapons Cocking ] HOLD YOUR FIRE ! [ Man ] SIR, THERE'S A LADDER OVER HERE. [ Footsteps ] COLONEL JACK O'NEILL ? RETIRED. I'M MAJOR SAMUELS. AIR FORCE ? YES, SIR. I'M THE GENERAL'S EXECUTIVE OFFICER. WANT A LITTLE PIECE OF ADVICE, MAJOR ? GET "REASSED" TO NASA. THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ACTION'S GONNA BE-- OUT THERE. I'M, UH, UNDER ORDERS TO BRING YOU TO SEE GENERAL HAMMOND, SIR. NEVER HEARD OF HIM. HE REPLACED GENERAL WEST. HE SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT. HAS TO DO WITH THE STARGATE. [ Man Over P.A. ] TAG TEAM NUMBER NINE TO SUBLEVEL TWO. BEDSHAFT 24. WE HAVE TO TAKE A SECOND ELEVATOR THE REST OF THE WAY, SIR. IT'S A LONG WAY DOWN. [ Button Beeps ] YEAH, I KNOW. I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. AH. OF COURSE. THIS WAY, SIR. [ Knocking On Door ] COME. GENERAL HAMMOND, COLONEL JACK O'NEILL. RETIRED. I CAN SEE THAT. ME, I'M ON MY LAST TOUR. TIME TO START GETTING MY THOUGHTS TOGETHER, MAYBE WRITE A BOOK. YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WRITING A BOOK ABOUT YOUR EXPLOITS IN THE LINE OF DUTY ? I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. BUT THEN I'D HAVE TO SHOOT ANYONE THAT ACTUALLY READ IT. THAT'S A JOKE, SIR. MOST OF MY WORK THE PAST TEN YEARS WAS CLASSIFIED. YES, OF COURSE. MAJOR SAMUELS MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT THE STARGATE. DOWN TO BUSINESS. I CAN DO THAT. THIS WAY. ANYONE YOU KNOW, COLONEL ? THEY'RE NOT HUMAN. YOU THINK ? BEST WE CAN TELL, THESE SLITS ARE ACTUALLY A POUCH, SIMILAR TO THAT FOUND ON A MARSUPIAL. [ Major Samuels ] LIKE A KANGAROO. [ Doctor ] WE HAVEN'T DONE AN AUTOPSY YET. THESE PEOPLE-- OR ALIENS, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM-- CAME THROUGH, KILLED FOUR OF MY PEOPLE... AND KIDNAPPED ANOTHER, USING ADVANCED WEAPONS. WEAPONS, SIR ? WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW THEY OPERATE. [ Weapon Clicking ] SEEN ONE BEFORE, I TAKE IT ? YES, SIR. BUT THERE ARE NO CREATURES LIKE THIS ON ABYDOS. THOSE PEOPLE WERE HUMAN. THEY WERE FROM EARTH. RA BROUGHT THEM THERE THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. BUT YOUR REPORT SAID THIS RA WAS, IN FACT, SOME KIND OF ALIEN THAT LIVED INSIDE A HUMAN BODY. YEAH, HIS EYES GLOWED. THAT WAS OUR FIRST CLUE. ARE YOU SURE HE'S DEAD, COLONEL ? UNLESS HE COULD SURVIVE A TACTICAL NUCLEAR WARHEAD BLOWIN' UP IN HIS FACE, I'M POSITIVE. - WHY ? - COLONEL, THESE PEOPLE-- OR WHATEVER THEY ARE-- WERE GUARDING ANOTHER MAN WHO RETREATED BACK THROUGH THE STARGATE. I GOT A GOOD LOOK AT HIS EYES, COLONEL. THEY GLOWED. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE STARGATE MISSION AFTER ALL THIS TIME, COLONEL ? HOW DO YOU MEAN ? WELL, IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR. HAS YOUR PERSPECTIVE CHANGED ? WELL, SIR, I-- WAS THAT-- [ Hammond ] KAWALSKY AND FERRETTI, YES. THEY WERE UNDER YOUR COMMAND ON THE FIRST STARGATE MISSION. TELL ME ABOUT DANIEL JACKSON, COLONEL. WHY ARE THEY QUESTIONING MY MEN ? THEY'RE NOT YOUR MEN ANYMORE, COLONEL. YOU RETIRED. DANIEL JACKSON ? YOU READ THE REPORT ? YES. - IT'S ALL THERE. - IS IT ? WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT, GENERAL ? YOU DIDN'T LIKE DANIEL JACKSON, DID YOU ? DANIEL WAS A SCIENTIST. HE SNEEZED A LOT. BASICALLY, HE WAS A GEEK, SIR. SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR HIM ? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. HE ALSO SAVED MY LIFE AND FOUND THE WAY HOME FOR MY MEN AND ME. A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT KINDA MAKES A PERSON GROW ON YOU. KNOW WHAT I MEAN ? ACCORDING TO THE MISSION BRIEF, YOUR ORDERS WERE TO GO THROUGH THE STARGATE, TO DETECT ANY POSSIBLE THREAT TO EARTH, AND IF FOUND, TO DETONATE A NUCLEAR DEVICE AND DESTROY THE GATE ON THE OTHER SIDE. - YES. - BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU DID, IS IT ? NOT RIGHT AWAY. RA'S FORCES OVERPOWERED MY TEAM AND... TOOK THE WEAPON BEFORE I COULD ARM IT. BUT WITH DR. JACKSON'S HELP, YOU EVENTUALLY REGAINED CONTROL AND DID, IN FACT, DETONATE THE WEAPON, YES ? - YES. - SO, TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, DANIEL JACKSON AND EVERYONE ELSE YOU KNEW ON ABYDOS IS DEAD, CORRECT ? THAT'S CORRECT. GOOD. THEN YOU WON'T MIND IF I AUTHORIZE A GO-AHEAD ON OUR PLAN. [ Door Opens, Closes ] THIS QUARTZ MATERIAL THE STARGATES ARE MADE OF-- IT MUST BE TOUGH STUFF IF IT CAN WITHSTAND A MARK III. WELL, WE SENT A ROBOT PROBE THROUGH AFTER WE GOT BACK, SIR. IT WAS FLATTENED ON THE OTHER END. OBVIOUSLY, THE ABYDOS STARGATE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE RUBBLE. BUT SOMEHOW IT GOT UNBURIED. [ Beeping ] OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE SENDING ANOTHER BOMB ? A MARK V THIS TIME. IF THESE CREATURES DID REOPEN THE ABYDOS GATE, WE INTEND TO RESEAL IT FOR GOOD. [ Beeping Continues ] GENERAL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. COUNTDOWN'S ALREADY STARTED. UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD. GENERAL HAMMOND ? SIR ? I REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT MY REPORT WAS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE. YOU DIDN'T DETONATE THE BOMB. NO, I DID DETONATE THE BOMB. IT WAS ABOARD RA'S SPACECRAFT, SO IT DID KILL HIM AND ELIMINATE THE RISK TO EARTH. HOWEVER ? HOWEVER, RA'S SHIP WAS IN ORBIT ABOVE THE PLANET AT THE TIME. NEITHER THE GATE NOR ANYTHING ELSE ON THE PLANET WAS DESTROYED. DANIEL JACKSON IS ALIVE AND LIVING WITH THE PEOPLE ON ABYDOS. YOU VIOLATED DIRECT ORDERS. WHY ? BECAUSE THE PEOPLE OF ABYDOS ARE NO THREAT TO US. THEY DESERVE TO BE LEFT ALONE. THAT'S NOT UP TO YOU. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, IF I'D COME BACK HERE AND REPORTED THE GATE ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS STILL INTACT, WE WOULD HAVE SENT ANOTHER BOMB, JUST LIKE YOU WERE ABOUT TO. IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO LET THOSE PEOPLE DIE. THE THREAT FROM RA WAS GONE. WHAT ABOUT THE PROBE WE SENT THROUGH ? IT WAS CRUSHED INSTANTLY. AFTER WE CAME HOME, DANIEL BURIED THE GATE IN ROCKS, MAKING MY RETURN OR ANYBODY ELSE'S IMPOSSIBLE. WELL, THOSE FOUR BODIES LYING IN THE INFIRMARY SAY OTHERWISE, AIRMAN. [ Scoffs ] - WE'LL SEND THE BOMB THROUGH ON SCHEDULE. - GENERAL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT ! - OH, I CAN'T ? - THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE ON THAT PLANET. THERE ARE INNOCENT PEOPLE HERE ! I HAVE MY ORDERS TOO, COLONEL. I OBEY MINE. TAKE COLONEL O'NEILL TO THE HOLDING ROOM. LET'S GIVE HIM SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT THINGS... WHILE I DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH HIM. SERGEANT. COLONEL O'NEILL, SIR. I'M RETIRED, KAWALSKY. LOSE THE SALUTE. ME AND FERRETTI DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING. I APPRECIATE THAT. HEY, THOSE KIDS ON ABYDOS SAVED MY LIFE TOO. YEAH. THE KIDS. I MEAN, THEY'RE THE WHOLE REASON THAT WE KEPT THE SECRET. RIGHT ? YEAH. THAT ONE KID IDOLIZED YOU. REMEMBER HIM ? WEIRD NAME. WHAT WAS IT ? SKAARA. RIGHT. REMEMBER HOW HE WAS ALWAYS SALUTING YOU ? YEAH. MY KID USED TO DO THAT WHEN HE WAS LITTLE. SKAARA KIND OF REMINDED ME OF HIM. OH, MAN, COLONEL. YOU AND ME WENT THROUGH THAT WHOLE MISSION TOGETHER. I NEVER EVEN KNEW YOU HAD A SON. WELL, HE DIED. JUST BEFORE THE ABYDOS MISSION. I'M SORRY, SIR. I HAD NO IDEA. [ Door Opens ] HOW MANY PEOPLE DID YOU SAY ARE ON ABYDOS ? THAT WE SAW ? MAYBE... 5,000. DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE RECONSIDERING SENDING THE BOMB, SIR ? IT MEANS I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS. GENERAL, LET ME TAKE A TEAM THROUGH THAT GATE. WE'LL FIND OUT WHO THOSE ALIENS ARE. KAWALSKY AND I HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE. WE KNOW THE LAY OF THE LAND. WE KNOW THE PEOPLE. YOU THINK YOU KNOW THEM. JACKSON COULD BE DEAD. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D BE WALKING INTO. SIR, THERE IS ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. RIGHT. WE'LL HAVE THE PROTOTYPE PROBE SHIPPED FROM M.I.T. - GENERAL, WE DON'T NEED THAT PROBE. - WE DON'T ? NOPE. THIS'LL DO. [ Stargate Whirring ] - [ Technicians' Voices Overlapping ] - [ Beeping ] - [ Technician ] CHEVRON FOUR, ENCODED. - CARE TO EXPLAIN THIS CONCEPT ? CHEVRON FIVE, ENCODED. - JACKSON HAS ALLERGIES. - I GET IT. HE'LL KNOW THIS CAME FROM ME AND NOT FROM SOMEONE-- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR-- LIKE YOURSELF. OPTIMUM LEVEL. - [ Beeping Continues ] - CHEVRON SIX, ENCODED. [ Technicians Chattering ] CHEVRON SEVEN, LOCKED. THE, UM, OBJECT SHOULD REACH FINAL DESTINATION IN FIVE SECONDS. FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE. THE OBJECT SHOULD NOW BE THROUGH THE ABYDOS STARGATE. NOW WHAT ? [ O'Neill ] NOW WE WAIT. IF DANIEL'S STILL AROUND, HE'LL KNOW WHAT THE MESSAGE MEANS. WHAT IF THE ALIENS GET IT ? WELL, THEY COULD BE BLOWING THEIR NOSES RIGHT NOW. THEY COULD BE PLANNING AN ATTACK. AW, COME ON, SAMUELS. LET ME BE THE CYNIC AROUND HERE, OKAY ? SIR, THIS COULD TAKE SOME TIME. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Rumbling, Rattling ] PERMISSION TO TAKE A TEAM THROUGH THE STARGATE, SIR. ASSUMING I GET THE PRESIDENT'S AUTHORIZATION, THE MISSION BRIEFING WILL BE AT 0800 HOURS. CONSIDER YOURSELF RECALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY, COLONEL. TEN HUT ! [ Hammond ] GENTLEMEN, TAKE YOUR SEATS. WHERE'S CAPTAIN CARTER ? JUST ARRIVING, SIR. CARTER ? I'M ASSIGNING SAM CARTER TO THIS MISSION. I'D PREFER TO PUT TOGETHER MY OWN TEAM, SIR. NOT ON THIS MISSION. SORRY. CARTER'S OUR EXPERT ON THE STARGATE. WHERE IS HE TRANSFERRING FROM ? [ Woman ] SHE IS TRANSFERRING FROM THE PENTAGON. I TAKE IT YOU'RE COLONEL O'NEILL. CAPTAIN SAMANTHA CARTER REPORTING, SIR. BUT OF COURSE, YOU GO BY "SAM." YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY, MAJOR. I PLAYED WITH DOLLS WHEN I WAS A KID. - G.I. JOE ? - NO, MAJOR MATT MASON. OH. WHO ? MAJOR MATT MASON-- ASTRONAUT DOLL. - DID YOU HAVE THAT COOL LITTLE BACKPACK THAT MADE HIM FLY ? - LET'S GET STARTED. - COLONEL ? - THANK YOU. FOR THOSE OF YOU ON YOUR FIRST TRIP THROUGH THE GATE, YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR WHAT TO EXPECT. I'VE PRACTICALLY MEMORIZED YOUR REPORT FROM THE FIRST MISSION. I'D LIKE TO THINK I'VE BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS ALL MY LIFE. I THINK WHAT THE COLONEL IS SAYING IS, HAVE YOU EVER PULLED OUT OF A SIMULATED BOMBING RUN IN AN F-16 AT EIGHT PLUS "G"S ? YES. WELL, IT'S WAY WORSE THAN THAT. BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE OTHER SIDE, YOU'RE FROZEN STIFF, LIKE YOU'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH A BLIZZARD, NAKED. THAT'S A RESULT OF THE COMPRESSION YOUR MOLECULES UNDERGO... DURING THE MILLISECOND REQUIRED FOR RECONSTITUTION. OH, HERE WE GO. ANOTHER SCIENTIST. GENERAL, PLEASE. THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICIST. WHICH MEANS ? WHICH MEANS SHE IS SMARTER THAN YOU ARE, COLONEL. ESPECIALLY IN MATTERS RELATED TO THE STARGATE. [ Clears Throat ] COLONEL, I WAS STUDYING THE GATE TECHNOLOGY FOR TWO YEARS... BEFORE DANIEL JACKSON MADE IT WORK AND BEFORE YOU BOTH WENT THROUGH. I SHOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THEN. BUT, SIR, YOU AND YOUR MEN MIGHT AS WELL ACCEPT THE FACT... THAT I AM GOING THROUGH THIS TIME. WELL, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, DOCTOR, I-- IT IS APPROPRIATE TO REFER TO A PERSON BY THEIR RANK, NOT THEIR SALUTATION. YOU SHOULD CALL ME CAPTAIN, NOT DOCTOR. CAPTAIN CARTER'S ASSIGNMENT TO THIS UNIT IS NOT AN OPTION, IT'S AN ORDER. I'M AN AIR FORCE OFFICER JUST LIKE YOU ARE, COLONEL. AND JUST BECAUSE MY REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS ARE ON THE INSIDE... INSTEAD OF THE OUTSIDE DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T HANDLE WHATEVER YOU CAN HANDLE. [ Man Chuckling ] OH, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU BEING A WOMAN. [ Clears Throat ] I LIKE WOMEN. I'VE JUST GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH SCIENTISTS. COLONEL, I LOGGED OVER A HUNDRED HOURS IN ENEMY AIRSPACE DURING THE GULF WAR. IS THAT TOUGH ENOUGH FOR YOU ? OR ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO ARM WRESTLE ? [ Clears Throat ] I HATE TO THROW A DAMPER ON YOUR ENTHUSIASM, BUT I STILL SAY THE SAFEST, MOST LOGICAL WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS... IS TO BURY THE STARGATE, JUST LIKE THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS DID. MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ALIENS TO RETURN. IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO ELIMINATE THE THREAT. - EXCEPT IT WON'T WORK. - IT WORKED BEFORE. THEY KNOW WHAT WE ARE NOW. THEY KNOW HOW FAR WE'VE COME. WE'RE A THREAT TO THEM. THEY'VE GOT SHIPS, GENERAL. RA HAD ONE AS BIG AS THE GREAT PYRAMIDS. THEY DON'T NEED THE STARGATE TO GET HERE. THEY CAN DO IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY. NOW, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MR. GLASS-IS-HALF-EMPTY OVER HERE, DON'T YOU THINK THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD USE THE STARGATE TO DO A LITTLE RECONNAISSANCE... BEFORE THEY DECIDE TO COME BACK ? AGAIN ? I'LL GIVE YOU EXACTLY 24 HOURS TO EITHER RETURN OR SEND A MESSAGE THROUGH. NO KLEENEX BOXES, PLEASE. OTHERWISE, WE'LL ASSUME THE WORST AND SEND A BOMB THROUGH. UNDERSTOOD. - TRY TO FOLLOW ORDERS THIS TIME, COLONEL. - SIR ? THIS TIME YOU BRING DANIEL JACKSON BACK. IS THAT CLEAR ? YES, SIR. MOVE OUT. CAPTAIN ? OH, DON'T WORRY, COLONEL. I WON'T LET YOU DOWN. GOOD. I WAS GONNA SAY, "LADIES FIRST." YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY WILL LIKE ME WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW ME. OH, I ADORE YOU ALREADY, CAPTAIN. MY GOD ! LOOK AT THIS. THE ENERGY THE GATE MUST RELEASE TO CREATE A STABLE WORMHOLE-- IT'S ASTRONOMICAL, TO USE EXACTLY THE RIGHT WORD. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EVENT HORIZON. [ Coughs ] OH. I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK. OH. MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD THAT BIG LUNCH, HUH ? [ Weapons Cocking ] CHA'HALI ! CHA'HALI. LOWER YOUR GUNS. [ Chattering ] HELLO, JACK. [ Chuckles ] WELCOME BACK. [ Both Whispering ] SKAARA. O'NEILL. [ Both Laughing ] YEAH. I DID NOT THINK TO BE SEEING YOU AGAIN. - DANIEL, HOW YOU DOING ? - UH, GOOD. YOU ? MUCH BETTER, NOW THAT I SEE EVERYBODY'S OKAY. - GREETINGS FROM EARTH, DR. JACKSON. - HELLO, FERRETTI. BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHIN', DANIEL. KAWALSKY. [ Chuckling ] SHA'RE, DON'T BE SHY. HI. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. [ Chattering ] SO, I FIGURED IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME... BEFORE YOU HAD TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT US STILL BEING HERE. YEAH. WHY THE MILITIA ? HAS SOMETHING ELSE COME THROUGH ? NO, WE'RE JUST TAKING PRECAUTIONS. WHY ? AMAZING. THIS IS WHAT WAS MISSING FROM THE DIG AT GIZA. THIS IS HOW THEY CONTROLLED IT. IT TOOK US 15 YEARS AND THREE SUPERCOMPUTERS... TO MACGYVER A SYSTEM FOR THE GATE ON EARTH. [ O'Neill ] CAPTAIN ? LOOK HOW SMALL IT IS ! CAPTAIN ! OH. RIGHT. EXCUSE ME. [ Chuckles ] DR. JACKSON, I PRESUME. I'M DR. SAMANTHA CARTER. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO BE CALLED CAPTAIN. WHAT'S GOING ON, JACK ? SIX HOSTILE ALIENS CAME THROUGH THE STARGATE ON EARTH. - FOUR PEOPLE ARE DEAD, ONE'S MISSING. - ONE OF THEM LOOKED LIKE RA. WELL, THEY DIDN'T COME FROM HERE. I MEAN, THE BOYS TAKE SHIFTS GUARDING IT 36 HOURS A DAY EVERY DAY. WE'D KNOW IF THEY CAME THROUGH HERE. WELL, THEY CAME FROM SOMEWHERE, DANIEL. I'M GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AROUND. ALL RIGHT. I THINK I CAN HELP YOU FIND OUT WHO IT WAS, BUT IT'S GONNA HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE SANDSTORM IS OVER. UH, WE WERE ABOUT TO HAVE OUR EVENING MEAL. WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US ? [ Wind Howling ] [ Chattering, Laughing ] BEANAA WA. EVERYBODY TRY THIS. THIS TOO. WHAT'S THIS ? DRINK. - MOONSHINE ? - "MOONSHINE" ? YEAH, MOONSHINE. AS IN BOOZE. UH-- DANIEL, WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING THESE KIDS ? TRY IT. ALL RIGHT. SKAARA'S MOONSHINE. GIVE IT A LITTLE SHOT. [ Coughs ] OH, GOD ! [ Hoarse Voice ] SMOOTH. VERY SMOOTH. MOONSHINE ! YOUR LITTLE SOLDIERS ARE ALL GROWN UP, COLONEL. YEAH. I'M SO PROUD. WHOA. O'NEILL. YOUR LIGHTER. [ Clears Throat ] NO. IT'S YOURS. I GAVE THAT TO YOU TO KEEP. REMEMBER ? THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, HE'S NEVER HAD THAT OUT OF HIS SIGHT THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE GONE. YEAH ? SO THIS-- THIS MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE RA-- HE MUST'VE COME THROUGH ANOTHER GATE. WHAT OTHER GATE ? THE STARGATE ONLY GOES HERE. ANOTHER STARGATE ? NO. NO, I THINK YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT. I WAS THERE. WE RAN HUNDREDS OF PERMUTATIONS. - BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE WHAT YOU NEED. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? DANIEL, THE STORM HAS PASSED. I'LL SHOW YOU. SHA'RE, BEN QUA RI JACK AND HIS FRIENDS TO SEE THE VILI TAO AN. - BONNI WAI ? - [ Daniel ] I WON'T BE LONG. [ People Hooting ] [ Hooting Continues ] GOOD-BYE, MY DANIEL. GOOD-BYE. FERRETTI, HOLD THE FORT. YES, SIR. BOY, I CAN'T SAY I MISSED THIS PLACE. COME ON. THIS IS JUST INCREDIBLE. [ Daniel ] SO, I FIGURED THAT THERE HAD TO BE MORE TO THIS PLACE, SO I STARTED EXPLORING. JUST THE AREA AROUND THE TOWN AND THE PYRAMID, AT FIRST. THEN AFTER ABOUT A MONTH, I FOUND THIS PLACE. CAPTAIN DOCTOR, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. [ Carter ] OH, MY GOD ! THIS IS AMAZING. THIS IS THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND OF THE CENTURY. DANIEL, YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TRANSLATE THIS YET ? I THINK SO. WHAT'S IT SAY ? [ Daniel ] WELL, IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING. ACTUALLY, IT'S SORT OF A CHART, MORE OF A MAP. OF ? WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ANALYZE ALL OF IT. I MEAN, LOOK AT IT. IT WOULD TAKE MY WHOLE LIFE. WELL, DANIEL, WE DON'T HAVE THAT LONG. WHAT'S IT A MAP OF ? WELL, THE CARTOUCHES SEEM TO BE SEPARATED CLEARLY INTO GROUPINGS. EACH GROUPING IS ATTACHED TO THE OTHERS WITH A SERIES OF LINES. EACH GROUPING OF 'GLYPHS CONTAIN SEVEN SYMBOLS. - SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING, OF COURSE. - TELL US ANYWAY. ALL THE SYMBOLS ARE ON THE STARGATE IN THE ABYDOS CHAMBER. I'VE ALSO MANAGED TO CHART SOME OF THEM IN THE ABYDOS NIGHT SKY, OR AT LEAST PRETTY CLOSE. JACK, I THINK THAT THIS IS A MAP OF A VAST NETWORK OF STARGATES-- STARGATES THAT ARE-ARE ALL OVER THE GALAXY. UH, I DON'T THINK THAT CAN BE, DOCTOR. WHY NOT ? BECAUSE AFTER COLONEL O'NEILL AND HIS TEAM CAME BACK, MY TEAM TRIED HUNDREDS OF SYMBOL PERMUTATIONS, USING EARTH AS THE POINT OF ORIGIN, AND IT NEVER WORKED. I TRIED THE SAME HERE, AND IT DIDN'T WORK EITHER. BUT I FIGURED THE DESTINATIONS I TRIED WERE EITHER DESTROYED OR BURIED. - BUT, I MEAN, SOME OF THEM SOMEWHERE MUST STILL EXIST. - I DON'T THINK SO. THEN WHERE DID YOUR RA LOOK-ALIKE COME FROM ? I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ASTROPHYSICS, BUT COULDN'T THE PLANETS CHANGE ? I MEAN, UH, DRIFT APART OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO THROW THIS MAP OFF ? I KNEW I'D LIKE YOU. YOU MEAN I'M RIGHT ? ACCORDING TO THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE MODEL, ALL BODIES IN THE UNIVERSE ARE CONSTANTLY MOVING FURTHER APART. SO IN THE THOUSANDS OF YEARS SINCE THE STARGATE WAS BUILT-- ALL THE COORDINATES COULD'VE CHANGED. BUT WHY DOES IT STILL WORK... BETWEEN ABYDOS AND EARTH ? ABYDOS IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST PLANET IN THE NETWORK TO EARTH. THE CLOSER THEY ARE, THE LESS THE DIFFERENCE IN RELATIVE POSITION DUE TO EXPANSION. THE FURTHER AWAY, THE GREATER THE DIFFERENCE. IN A FEW THOUSAND YEARS, IT WON'T WORK BETWEEN EARTH AND ABYDOS EITHER. UNLESS YOU CAN ADJUST FOR THE DISPLACEMENT. RIGHT. WITH THIS MAP AS A BASE, THAT SHOULD BE EASY. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS CORRECT FOR DOPPLER SHIFT. THEN, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO ARRIVE AT A COMPUTER MODEL... THAT WILL PREDICT THE ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY TO GET THE GATE WORKING AGAIN. OKAY. SO, WHAT DID WE JUST FIGURE OUT ? ANY CIVILIZATION ADVANCED ENOUGH TO BUILD THIS GATE NETWORK... WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPENSATE FOR 50,000 YEARS OF STELLAR DRIFT. [ O'Neill ] SO, THE STARGATE CAN GO OTHER PLACES. THE ALIENS COULD HAVE COME FROM ANYWHERE. MAN, YOU GOTTA GIVE DANIEL CREDIT. SHE IS ONE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. - [ Whirring ] - WE GOT COMPANY, BOYS ! MOVE ! MOVE ! EVERYBODY TAKE COVER ! [ Panicked Chattering ] [ People Screaming ] [ Automatic Weapon Fire ] [ Gunfire Continues ] AAH ! SHA'RE ! SHIM ROTA ! SHIM ROTA ! [ Screams ] NO ! [ Screaming Continues ] [ Weapon Clicking ] [ Grunts ] NO ! SKAARA ! THIS IS NOT YOUR WEAPON. WHERE DID YOU GET IT ? [ Alien ] GOOD CHOICE, TEAL'C. A PERFECT SPECIMEN. [ Sha're ] NO ! NO ! STOP THAT ! STOP THAT ! NO ! SKAARA ! SKAARA ! [ Screaming ] [ Gasping ] YOU MAY BE THE ONE. [ Continues Pressing Buttons ] [ Groans ] [ Stargate Whirring ] [ Chattering ] [ People Crying, Groaning ] SHA'RE ! BOLAA. [ Ferretti ] THERE'S SO-- THERE'S SO MANY-- WHAT ? THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM. IT'S ALL RIGHT. JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. IT WAS RA. WHAT'S GOIN' ON ? RA IS DEAD. TAO QUA RA. [ Bolaa ] NO. RA-- I SAW-- HE TOOK SHA'RE. HE TOOK SKAARA INTO THE CHAAPA-AI. [ Coughing ] WHERE ? DID YOU SEE ? DID YOU SEE ? WHAT'S GOING ON, DANIEL ? COULD THERE BE ANOTHER RA ? HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW ? I SHOULD'VE LEFT THE BARRICADE UP. THIS IS MY FAULT. COME ON. COME ON ! COLONEL, FERRETTI NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION NOW ! GO ! HELP HIM. I CAN SEND YOU BACK. YOU'RE COMING WITH US THIS TIME, DANIEL. I'VE GOT ORDERS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR ORDERS, COLONEL. MY WIFE IS OUT THERE. SO IS SKAARA. AND THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA GET 'EM BACK IS FOR YOU TO COME HOME WITH US. FERRETTI MIGHT HAVE SEEN THOSE COORDINATES. CAPTAIN, DO YOU HAVE THE VIDEO ? I'VE GOT EVERYTHING I NEED. SO MANY-- NI-YA ! NI-YA. AFTER WE GO THROUGH THE CHAAPA-AI, YOU HAVE TO BURY IT LIKE WE DID BEFORE AND THEN LEAVE THIS PLACE. YOU COME BACK ? NO, I CAN'T. NOBODY CAN. THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU. NOT FOR, UH, A LONG TIME. NOW, AS SOON AS WE'RE GONE, I WANT YOU TO CLOSE IT, BURY IT. PUT A BIG, HEAVY COVER STONE OVER IT. NOTHING GOOD CAN EVER COME THROUGH THIS GATE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME ? YOU CAME THROUGH IT, "DANYER." DO YOU REMEMBER THE STORY I TOLD YOU ? HOW THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS BACK ON EARTH CUT THEMSELVES OFF FROM RA ? WELL, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. THEN, IN ONE YEAR-- ONE YEAR FROM THIS DAY, YOU TAKE THE COVER STONE AWAY. I WILL TRY TO BRING SHA'RE HOME WITH ME ON THAT DAY. BUT IF I DON'T MAKE IT BACK, IF I DON'T-- IF I DON'T RETURN, THEN YOU MUST BURY THE GATE AGAIN FOREVER. JOA QUA ? YOU TELL SHA'RE'S FATHER-- IN ONE YEAR. [ Technician ] STAND BY FOR ARRIVAL ! STAND BY FOR ARRIVAL ! [ Chattering ] INCOMING TRAFFIC COMING THROUGH. GET THE MEDIC ! MEDIC ! CLOSE THE IRIS ! CLOSE THE IRIS ! IRIS GONE. [ Technician ] WORMHOLE DISENGAGED. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT, SIR ? THAT'S OUR INSURANCE AGAINST ANY MORE SURPRISES. IT'S PURE TITANIUM, HOPEFULLY IMPENETRABLE. [ Groaning ] [ Men Chattering ] [ Medic ] GET THE GAUZE ON HIM. WE'VE GOT TO STOP THE BLEEDING FROM HIS LEG. WHAT HAPPENED, COLONEL ? BASE CAMP WAS HIT WHILE WE WERE ON RECON, SIR. SAME HOSTILES WHO ATTACKED US ? THAT'S A FAIR GUESS. JACKSON'S WIFE AND ONE OF OUR KIDS WAS KIDNAPPED. YOUR KIDS ? FROM THE PREVIOUS MISSION, SIR. GENERAL, HI. DANIEL JACKSON. WE'VE NEVER MET. I'D LIKE TO BE ON THE TEAM THAT GOES AFTER THEM. YOU'RE NOT IN ANY POSITION TO MAKE DEMANDS, JACKSON. [ Chattering ] CHEL NOK, HER. NO ! NO ! SKAARA ! SKAARA ! YOUR DEATH CANNOT HELP HER. [ Grunting ] I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU ! [ Chattering, Shouting ] [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Heart Monitor Beeping ] [ O'Neill ] DOC SAYS HE'S GONNA MAKE IT. YES, SIR. YOU GONNA STAY HERE ALL NIGHT ? YES, SIR. HEY. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH ME. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. COME ON. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. [ Sneezes ] NICE CATCH. THANK YOU. SORRY. GATE TRAVEL ALWAYS SEEMS TO MAKE MY ALLERGIES-- [ Blowing Nose ] SORRY. SO, YOU WERE SAYING. ANYWAY, AS SOON AS YOU WERE GONE AND THEY REALIZED THEY WERE FREE-- I MEAN, ABYDOS WAS THEIR WORLD FOR THE TAKING. - HAD A LITTLE PARTY, DID YA ? - OH, YEAH. A BIG, BIG PARTY. THEY TREATED ME LIKE THEIR SAVIOR. IT WAS, UM, EMBARRASSING. IT'S AMAZING YOU TURNED OUT SO NORMAL. WELL, IF IT WASN'T FOR SHA'RE, I PROBABLY-- SHE WAS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF EVERYONE ELSE. SHE PRACTICALLY FELL ON THE FLOOR LAUGHING EVERY TIME I TRIED... TO DO SOME CHORE THEY ALL TOOK FOR GRANTED, LIKE, UM, GRINDING YAPHETTA FLOUR. I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO GRIND YOUR OWN FLOUR ? I'M TRYING TO KICK THE FLOUR THING. THIS IS GOING STRAIGHT TO MY HEAD. WHAT TIME IS IT ANYWAY ? I MUST HAVE GATE LAG OR SOMETHING. DANIEL, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, YOU'VE HAD ONE BEER. YOU'RE A CHEAPER DATE THAN MY WIFE WAS. YES, WHEN AM I GOING TO MEET YOUR WIFE ? OH, PROBABLY, UH, NEVER. AFTER I CAME BACK FROM ABYDOS THE FIRST TIME, SHE'D ALREADY LEFT. I'M SORRY. YEAH, SO WAS I. I THINK IN HER HEART SHE FORGAVE ME FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KID. SHE JUST... COULDN'T FORGET. AND WHAT ABOUT YOU ? I'M THE OPPOSITE. I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF. BUT SOMETIMES I CAN FORGET. SOMETIMES. [ Chattering ] YOU. [ Woman Gasps ] WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME ? I'M A SERGEANT IN THE U.S. AIR FORCE ! I DEMAND TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE TAKING ME ! [ Grunting ] LET GO ! LET GO OF ME ! WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU TAKING ME ? COME. LOVELY. FULL OF LIFE. YOU COULD BE THE VESSEL FOR MY FUTURE QUEEN. YES. YES. VERY NICE, INDEED. BUT I AM NOT THE ONE YOU MUST FINALLY PLEASE. YAMETHA, RE ! [ Gasps ] [ Whimpers ] [ Hisses ] [ Alien ] DOES SHE PLEASE YOU, MY LOVE ? [ Snarling ] A SHAME. SEND ANOTHER ! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, GENERAL HAMMOND. PEOPLE, WHAT IS SPOKEN OF IN THIS ROOM IS CLASSIFIED AS S.C.I. TOP SECRET. COLONEL, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE HOSTILES WE DIDN'T YESTERDAY ? NOT A HELL OF A LOT, GENERAL. THE ABYDON BOYS... WHO SURVIVED THE ATTACK ON THE BASE CAMP THOUGHT IT WAS RA. I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD. GENTLEMEN, WHICH IS IT ? OH, HE'S DEAD. HE'S DEFINITELY DEAD. THE BOMB-- I MEAN, HE'S GOTTA BE DEAD, RIGHT ? - THEN WHO'S COMING THROUGH THE STARGATE ? - GODS. - WHAT ? - [ Men Sighing ] NOT AS IN "GOD" GOD. RA PLAYED A GOD-- THE SUN GOD. HE BORROWED THE RELIGION AND CULTURE OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS... HE BROUGHT THROUGH THE GATE AND THEN HE USED IT TO ENSLAVE THEM. YOU SEE, HE WANTED THE PEOPLE OF ABYDOS TO BELIEVE THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE. SO YOU'RE SAYING RA'S NOT THE LAST OF HIS RACE AFTER ALL. - MAYBE HE'S GOT A BROTHER RAY. - THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. WAIT A MINUTE. THE LEGEND GOES, RA'S RACE WAS DYING. HE SURVIVED BY TAKING OVER THE BODY OF HIS HUMAN HOST, AN EGYPTIAN BOY. BUT WHO'S TO SAY MORE OF HIS KIND COULDN'T DO THE SAME THING ? I MEAN, THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED AT ANY TIME, ANYWHERE THERE'S A GATE. I MEAN, THIS COULD BE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. COLONEL, YOU'VE HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN FIGHTING THIS HOSTILE. ASSUMING YOU HAVE TO DEFEND YOURSELF IN THE FIELD, ARE YOU UP TO IT ? - WE BEAT 'EM ONCE. - I'LL TAKE THAT AS A MAYBE. CAPTAIN CARTER, YOU'RE CONFIDENT THAT THE STARGATE... WILL TAKE US WHERE WE WANT TO GO WITH THIS NEW INFORMATION ? THEY'RE FEEDING THE REVISED COORDINATES INTO THE TARGETING COMPUTER RIGHT NOW. IT'LL TAKE TIME TO CALCULATE, BUT IT SHOULD SPIT OUT TWO OR THREE DESTINATIONS A MONTH. PEOPLE, LET'S NOT FOOL OURSELVES HERE. THIS THING IS BOTH VAST AND DANGEROUS. AND WE ARE SO FAR OVER OUR HEADS WE CAN BARELY SEE DAYLIGHT. WE WOULD ALL BE MUCH BETTER OFF... IF THE STARGATE HAD BEEN LEFT IN THE GROUND. WITH RESPECT, SIR, WE CAN'T BURY OUR HEADS IN THE SAND. THINK OF HOW MUCH WE COULD LEARN. THINK OF WHAT WE COULD BRING BACK. WHAT YOU COULD BRING BACK IS PRECISELY WHAT I'M AFRAID OF, CAPTAIN. HOWEVER, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAPPENS TO AGREE WITH YOU. IN THE EVENT YOUR THEORIES PAN OUT, HE HAS ORDERED THE FORMATION OF NINE TEAMS... WHOSE DUTIES WILL BE TO FORM RECONNAISSANCE, DETERMINE THREATS, AND IF POSSIBLE, TO MAKE PEACEFUL CONTACT... WITH THE PEOPLES OF THESE WORLDS. THESE TEAMS WILL OPERATE ON A COVERT, TOP-SECRET BASIS. NO ONE WILL KNOW OF THEIR EXISTENCE... EXCEPT THE PRESIDENT AND THE JOINT CHIEFS. - COLONEL O'NEILL ? - SIR ? YOUR TEAM WILL BE DESIGNATED SG-1. THE TEAM WILL CONSIST OF YOURSELF, CAPTAIN CARTER-- AND ME ? DR. JACKSON, WE NEED YOU TO WORK AS A CONSULTANT WITH THE OTHER SG TEAMS FROM HERE. YOUR EXPERTISE IN ANCIENT CULTURES AND LANGUAGES ARE FAR TOO VALUABLE-- NO. UM, LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS YOUR DECISION, BUT I JUST-- I REALLY HAVE TO BE ON THEIR TEAM. MY WIFE IS OUT THERE, GENERAL.

LET'S CONFIRM TRANSMITTER CODES. REMEMBER, ONLY THE RIGHT CODE WILL OPEN THE IRIS. IF YOU LOSE YOUR TRANSMITTER, YOU CANNOT GET HOME. UNDERSTOOD, SIR. [ Hammond ] SG-1 AND SG-2, IF YOU DO NOT RETURN IN 24 HOURS, YOUR REMOTE TRANSMITTER CODES WILL BE LOCKED OUT, AND THE IRIS WILL BE SEALED PERMANENTLY. AT THAT POINT, THERE WILL BE NO RETURN. - IS THAT UNDERSTOOD ? - YES, SIR. LET'S MOVE OUT. KIND OF WISH I WAS GOING WITH YOU. I'M KIND OF GLAD YOU'RE STAYING BEHIND. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, BOYS. [ Beeping ] [ Grunting ] DAMN IT, IT'S COLD. OKAY, PEOPLE, LET'S GET THE GEAR OUT. LET'S MOVE. [ Sneezes ] DOES ANYBODY HAVE A KLEENEX ? YOU. NO ! NO ! IT MUST BE SOME SORT OF CEREMONIAL PLACE. THE GATE HAS TO BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR SPIRITUAL CULTURE. THIS PLACE WAS BUILT FOR WORSHIPERS. LET'S TRY TO BE OUT OF HERE BEFORE THE "WORSHIPEES" SHOW UP, HUH ? YOU FIGURE OUT YET HOW TO ALIGN THIS GATE TO GET BACK HOME ? YEAH, THE DEVICE IS THE SAME AS ON ABYDOS. THIS SYMBOL REPRESENTS-- YOU BRIEF KAWALSKY'S TEAM YET ? YES.

WE COULD STILL GET A TRANSMISSION FROM OUR TEAMS. YES, SIR. BUT WE COULDN'T BE SURE IT'S NOT THE ALIENS... OR ONE OF OUR OWN PEOPLE UNDER DURESS OF TORTURE. SEALING THE STARGATE-- HOW MUCH LONGER DO THEY HAVE ? JUST UNDER TWO HOURS, SIR. [ Carter ] DANIEL ? DANIEL. SHA'RE. WHOA, EASY. YOU'VE BEEN UNCONSCIOUS FOR HOURS. NO, I SAW HER. I KNOW. WE ALL DID. I SAW SHA'RE. IF THERE'S A WAY OUT OF HERE, I HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET. - BUT LOOK WHAT I DID FIND. - DANIEL ! YOU'RE OKAY. I THINK SO.

IT GETS A LITTLE CHILLY ON THIS PLANET AT NIGHT. COLONEL SHOULD'VE SENT US A RADIO MESSAGE BY NOW. WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION... WHETHER OR NOT TO GO BACK TO THE STARGATE ? THAT'LL BE ABOUT WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER. I THINK THAT DESCRIBES OUR CURRENT SITUATION. WE ARE NOT LEAVING HERE WITHOUT THE COLONEL. IS THAT UNDERSTOOD? ANOTHER FINE DAY ON PLANET KAWALSKY. [ Carter ] SO RA ISN'T DEAD AFTER ALL. NO, IT WASN'T RA. IT WAS APOPHIS. WHO ? UM, IT'S FROM EGYPTIAN MYTHOLOGY. RA WAS THE SUN GOD WHO RULED THE DAY. APOPHIS WAS THE SERPENT GOD, RA'S RIVAL, WHO RULED THE NIGHT. IT'S RIGHT OUT OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD. THEY'RE LIVING IT. WE WILL SAVE SHA'RE ? I CAN'T PROMISE YOU ANYTHING AT THE MOMENT. BUT YOU ARE A GREAT WARRIOR. WE DEFEATED RA TOGETHER ! I KNOW. BUT TAKE A LOOK AROUND HERE. LOOK WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. WE'LL TRY. SHAKA HA !
