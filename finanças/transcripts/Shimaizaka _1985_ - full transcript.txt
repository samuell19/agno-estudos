A TOEI FILM This is a movie - about how the longing for love becomes so overwhelming, it throws one’s heart into disarray. From those turbulent hearts, a story emerged. FOUR SISTERS CHAPTER ONE: THE AUTUMN OF SORROW - Let's keep things fair and square. - Sure. Hey there! I'm a fourth-year architecture student and the vice captain of the fencing club, Yuzuki Togo. I'm the captain, Oba Ryo. Kitazawa Anzu, please pick one of us to be your boyfriend! We've already confirmed that you're single at the moment. We both saw you at the entrance ceremony, and fell in love at the same time. Which one of us? Your pick! Whoa, that's awesome! Two guys confessed to you at the same time? So, what's gonna happen? Since college, Oba and Yuzuki have been fated rivals in both studying and fencing. I don't know how this will go, but people are placing bets! We should bet too! Who's gonna win Anzu over? 'Course it's going to be Oba! I'm betting on Yuzuki. What's up? Why the long face? What did I do? You slapped him? What a pity! Pity? I just did what seemed natural to me. What if they're actually serious about you? To be honest, they had me for a second. But it's too much! How so? We're talking about the two boys who divided all college girls! Why would they be interested in a girl like me... It's good that you are self-aware. Akane! Anzu, you're a charming girl. Maybe I shouldn't have done it. You're regretting it? Don't worry about it. Most boys nowadays are wimps. They never grow up. Yuzuki is different! So his name is Yuzuki? I don't want to talk about it anymore. You always gloat over other people's agony. Agony? You're exaggerating! I'm not! It's hard being the target of gossip at school. This is Uzumasa station. See ya. Bye. Anzu! You're Yuzuki? I'm Yuzuki. Oh, you? I imagined Yuzuki to be wimpier. Sorry about that. What, so you're saying I'm wimpy? Right, you look more... unreliable. - Please hurry up. - Bye. Taking off. What's up with her? Never been called a wimp since I was born. Is she even a woman? Take that back! Akane's always got a sharp mind. What do you mean if she's even a woman? It's not funny! Akane? Is she... She's my big sister! She's working hard at Kyotopia as a portrait photographer. Anzu. Anzu! Don't talk to me anymore! I hate you both. Make way. O-Oda! But... Nozaki, what's the fourth rule of the fencing club? Respect your seniors, and obey orders. Good, make way then. You look amazing tonight. The girl dancing with Togo is his cousin Hodaiji Mariko, a fourth-year French student. She's so pretty. My family made plans to visit Hawaii for New Year. Dad told me to invite you too. Hey, Togo. Excuse me. Togo... My turn. - You've got a partner already. - Hey, fair and square, right? Stop it already! The first time I saw you, you were at the entrance ceremony. The second time, was when you were playing tennis. You were glistening with sweat, giving it all, chasing the ball... You looked so fresh and pretty, like a spring breeze. That's how I fell in love with you. Togo has never been this close with a girl besides me. I'm scared... I'm scared that Togo will eventually leave me, just like that. My birthday is on the ninth of January. Will you come to my house? It's only gonna be a small gathering of close friends, with some drinks, food, and games. I'd really like you to be there. Ladies and gentlemen, here comes tonight's main event! The lights will be out for ten seconds. In the dark, go ahead and kiss the one you have feelings for! Ladies, beware! Or shall I say, rejoice? Ready? Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Looks like I lost. Anzu! Hey! Whoever's night is not going well, come along. Drinks are on me. Really? Merry Christmas! - What kind of place is this? - Leave it to me! - Hey, miss! - Hey, miss! What are you boys up to at this hour? Miss, isn't Oba here a handsome fella? Isn't he a handsome fella? He got his heart broken today. - He's devastated! - Devastated! - We need drinks! - Drinks! It's fine, Midori, leave the rest to me. Okay, see you then. Sorry, you guys have fun! Midori. I'm off duty. Guess I'll just have to go to that bar every night then. Akane. Oh, so it's you! The heartbroken handsome fella. What, you got slapped in the face too? Anzu? Well, something like that. But why were you back there? Weren't you the hard-working photographer? Would you keep it a secret? Let me walk you back. What if you run into some creep? Unfortunately, I'm trying to get away from a creep this very moment. Bye-bye. Had too much to drink? None of your business. Here, I'll carry you until we see a taxi. I'm fine. Hey, you don't have to act all tough. And you call me a wimp? Welcome! Please come take a look! Adorable handmade dolls! Traditional Kyoto souvenirs! - Welcome! - Please take a look! Excuse me. Are those all handmade? Yes, made by our oldest sister. Are any of those by you? Yes, this crooked one right here! And this, this, this, and this too! Ai! I'll take all the ones made by Anzu, then. Really? Thank you very much! All the crooked ones! Thank you! Please come again. What a strange lady. She's so elegant. She was staring at you! That's because I'm pretty. The audacity! Anzu! Anzu, I need a hand serving coffee. Got it! I'll leave it to you then, Ai. It must feel good being Anzu. Everybody likes her. You came after all. Please. Thank you. Welcome. So your sister runs a coffee shop? Yes. My father used to run a photography studio, before my sister turned it into a coffee shop. Your sister takes care of everything at home, I reckon? Spare her with the questioning, will you? Anzu, please make yourself at home. If you don't mind. Thank you. I'll go ahead. Togo. Where are the other guests? I didn't invite anyone else. Why didn't you? You used to invite all your friends every year. What about Mariko? What's this about? Weren't you going to marry Mariko? Take it easy. Father, mother, I have something to say. Anzu. After I graduate, I'd like to marry you. Yuzuki... Are you... are you serious? Very. I'm very serious. I've decided that it can only be you. You... Togo! Togo! Please excuse me. Anzu! Togo! Give me back my Togo. Give? Even if you say so... If you won't, I'll slit it. Right here. I'm serious. Give me back my Togo. If you were to say... you wanted my favorite candies, I'd give them to you right away. What does that even mean? Togo is no candy. That's all I will say. Kitazawa, I understand where you're coming from, but do you think an orphan like you, could marry into a prestigious family? No way. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you. Me? In the Kitazawa family, everyone except for the oldest sister were adopted. You didn't know? You could have fooled me. I'm telling the truth. Togo's mother did a check on you. If you don't believe it, just look through the household register yourself. Hello, Kyotopia office. Oh, Anzu. Your lonely profile reflecting on the window What are you scribbling on the glass fogged up by your sigh? There's always a thing or two you want to forget It's the same for everyone If only you can open up and share your worries It might lighten your heavy heart... What's up with you, looking so gloomy? Akane! I feel like drinking today. Let's get drunk! You got dumped or something? Well... What's making your heart ache? If only I could put a stop to your flowing tears Let me embrace you with my open arms If you don't want the dreams to end Let’s indulge in fairy tales Look at you two all wasted, how unladylike! Relax! We just had a good sisters hangout. Akane, dear... Sometimes, drunk words are sober thoughts. Anzu, why don't you tell us all what you wanted to say? ANZU: ADOPTED DAUGHTER AKANE: ADOPTED DAUGHTER Anzu, where's did you find this? All these years, I trusted you with my whole heart. I've been a fool all along. But... How could you keep it from me for so long? Aya, Akane, you're too cruel. Anzu... I told Aya to keep it a secret. But why? I just don't think it matters. We had the best parents one could ask for. You probably don't remember, since you were so little... Our orphanage was called the Megumi Academy. It was a private institution. During the recession, it shut down. Most of the orphans, around thirty of us, were adopted by cousins or so. Somehow, though, nobody ever came for us three. So we just followed the nanny named Chiyo, and eventually arrived at this family. And it goes without saying who this Chiyo lady was. I can't leave these girls alone... Well, I guess we have four daughters now. I'm so glad. Let's go. One, two, three, four. Up that hill, up this hill... One, two, three, four. Up that hill, up this hill. One, two, three, four! Up that hill, up this hill. One, two, three, four... Mom and dad, they were so incredibly kind. They worked hard bringing us up. Just to take a short break, they went on a trip. A car accident at the destination took them away. Though, having to look after all four of us probably had already taken a toll on their lives. The burden became Aya's, and she still managed to take good care of us. You can hate me for this all you want. But don't you direct it to Aya. Akane... Don't talk like that. We're sisters. No matter what others say, we're siblings. Doesn't matter if we're blood relatives or not. We're... We're sisters bound by a bond much stronger than that. Just like Aya says, we're indeed siblings. But it's also true that we're not related by blood. Akane... Not sisters by blood... I understand that you need some time to take this in. But we shouldn't let it divide us. Ai! I heard everything. Everything you said. What's gonna happen to us? Nothing will change. These damned papers... they mean nothing! Turns out we all have different parents. We're all orphans. Like puppies and kittens... Abandoned. If we were gonna be abandoned, why were we even born in the first place? It's not like anyone asked us if we wanted to be born! Ai. Is Mariko okay? Luckily, we found her soon enough. She'll recover in two weeks. I'm serious! It's my fault. Hey, don't say that. I take responsibility for all this. But I won't take back what I said earlier. I probably don't deserve your love anymore, but my feelings towards you will never change. I'll wait until the day you forgive me. Have I lost to Mariko? Will I ever be able to love somebody as deeply as she did? I met Anzu the other day. Haven't you agreed to not meeting her? I know I'm not supposed to, but... What a graceful young lady she's become! I can't thank you and Akane enough for looking after her. That lovely child... I had that child with a man I truly loved in the past. My husband also understands how I feel about her. Thank you for coming all the way here. But we can't just give away our Anzu like this. Aya... Lately, she's troubled by a series of unexpected events. If you really care about her, please leave her alone. Aya, would you please at least ask her about it? If she would like to stay with the Kitazawa family, then I'll give up. I don't think that's necessary. I know Anzu better than anyone. Oh, Aya. You're right. Of course you do. Even better than her actual parents. You're more of a mother to her. If you say so... I can't say anything, can I? I'm heading out. Akane! I got a little defensive in front of her, and might have said some harsh things. Could I have done otherwise? I feel bad. It might actually be better for Anzu in the long run. If the Ayakoji family takes her back, she could even become a lawyer in the future. After all, she's Anzu's biological mother. They're related by blood. It's only natural for them to be together, isn't it? My real father passed away early on, and my mother was bedridden. After a series of moving around with my cousins, I ended up at that orphanage in Kyoto. I want to see my mom again. I've been living my life clinging onto that wish. If we don't want Anzu to live with regrets, better give her the chance to know what it's like to be with her real mother. 'Cause it's something you and I will never have again. If you put it like that... what else can I say? My dear sister. You've done nothing wrong. Not wanting to let her go shows that you've really taken up the role as her mother. If you had just let her go like that, I’m sure she’ll be disappointed too. That will probably hurt her more. Bye. Akane… Why are you taking me here? Akane! You’ll find out! Jeez... That woman, she’s the one who bought all the dolls I made. Listen, Anzu. Her name is Ayakoji Yoshie. She’s your real mother. Akane! Anzu. Silly me… I bet you are quite shocked. I was hesitant as well. But I am no doubt your mother. The one who gave birth to you. Anzu. Wait! Turns out that the four of us... never shared the same blood. Blood… Blood... What even is it? Ai, let’s go home! It’s past eleven! You guys can leave if you want. I wanna dance more. Ai! Hey, wanna dance with us? Look at her go! Ai! Ai… Whatever, we’re leaving! Goodnight. What do you want, following me around every night? You moonlighting as a hostess... It's hard to watch. Do you really have to entertain drunkards every night? Sorry, do I have to entertain you too? Ai! Hey, you. What are you doing? Who the hell are you? No idea. Ai, come here. What? She said she doesn’t know you. It’s none of your business. I’m her older sister. I don’t need sisters. Ai, come here! Get lost, lady! Son of a bitch, playing hero? I'll spare you this time. You’ll be sorry! You alright? I’m fine. Ai, let’s go home. Why do you even care? I’m just some puppy or kitten you found wandering around. Leave me alone! Even puppies know to be grateful for the ones who’ve taken care of them for three days. Imagine what mom and dad would think... if they saw you like this. You think you're the only pup? If it pains you, then it pains me too! Akane? Akane! Akane! Akane! Akane, just leave your part-time job already. We appreciate the extra income, but as long as we have enough to eat, we’ll figure everything out. Even so, we still got two kids in the house. It’d really help if we have one less mouth to feed. Akane! What are you saying? Alright, Anzu, it’s late. Aya. If you keep stressing over each one of us like that, you’ll age faster. You should worry about yourself more. What do you mean? At your age, there’s gotta be a man or two you like. What are you talking about? What am I… who am I living for? Am I needed by anyone at all? Togo. Please spend the night with me. Anzu. Togo... Akane! I’ve decided to go live with the Ayakoji family in Tokyo. Are you really going? Do you wanna go to Tokyo that bad? Ai. Everyone, smile! Ready? OK. Ai, feel free to use everything I’m not bringing with me. I don’t need them! I won't see you off then, gotta go to work. Take care! Be safe. Anzu. Come back whenever you want to. Take care of yourself. You too, Aya. Ai. Please be good to Aya and Akane for me… Don’t go! Don’t go! Don’t go! Don't go... Please stop the car! Don’t go! Please stop! I’ll be good, I’ll be so awfully good! I’ll be a good little sister. So please don’t go. Don’t leave me! Ai... Anzu! Goodbye, Ai. Mr. Driver, please go. Anzu! Ai! Ai... Farewell, Aya, Ai, Akane, and Togo. Your lonely profile reflecting on the window What are you scribbling on the glass fogged up by your sigh? What’s going on, miss crybaby? There's always a thing or two you want to forget It's the same for everyone Songs are the best therapy. Give me a call whenever you’re feeling the blues. If only you can open up and share your worries... Please forgive me for the way I acted. I grew up knowing nothing but your love and kindness. From now on, I will learn to live on my own. I aspire to follow the footsteps of my foster mother, and become a caretaker at a childcare center in the future. I want to look after children who are less fortunate. I want to see how far I can go on my own. So for now, please leave me be. CHAPTER TWO: TO DIE FOR LOVE You’re saying that it’s a blood disease… Is it something like blood cancer or leukemia? We'd need a couple more checks to tell. The amount of white blood cells in your body is increasing at an unusual rate. While I still can’t say for sure what’s causing it, I suggest you start preparing for the worst. Doctor, no matter what the result will be, please don’t keep any secrets. I promise you I won’t panic. Be it five more years, or one more, I’d like to make the most out of it. I understand. I will do as you say. I appreciate it. Dr. Iwaki. It’s time for some fresh air, isn’t it? Why don’t you go have some coffee at our shop? I’m sure Aya will make you a great cup of coffee. You are…? I’m her younger sister. When you used to come to our shop, I was still in middle school. I used to admire you so much. I even drew a picture of myself in a wedding dress standing next to you. I hid it in the card case I had on me all the time. What are you staring at? You again. Sorry. Take me away. Please, take me. Where to? The sea. When the sea weeps, the seagulls are restless When the sea sleeps, the wind is the lullaby When the little boy cries, even the wind is upset When the little boy sleeps, the sea is the lullaby This is a lullaby from Shimabara. My mom used to sing it to me all the time. I even went to my hometown Hirado looking for this song. It was during a school trip in the second year of middle school. I thought my mother, who had been bedridden since I was born, would still be there. Then there she was. Now, I’ve got the same sickness she had. I guess you can call it destiny. Mom! Mom! Tell me. I want more time. I want to make it through this year. and ten more, and even a hundred years more. Tell me, what can I do? Behold! I’m the red demon dwelling in the capital - The One-Inch Boy! I’ll go after those who won’t obey me I’ll go after those who won't obey me Oh, what a beautiful princess Princess! I’ll take her as my bride Wait, the beautiful princess over there I’m the red demon, and you will be my wife Not on your life, you pumpkin face! What did you say? Let go of her, you pumpkin-faced red demon Who are you? I’m the One-Inch Boy, servant of the princess Oh, great timing! It’s been a hundred years since I last saw you Watch me swallow you, you tiny prick! Tickle, tickle Prickle, prickle Ouch! Take this final blow! Help! Thank you so much Once-Inch Boy, here’s your reward Back to normal, back to normal Back to normal, back to normal Back to normal, back to normal He’s getting bigger! Thank you, my princess Now I’m as tall as a real man And we all lived happily ever after Thank you! Thank you! Dai, I adore all those songs you wrote. They’re all amazing. I hope they’ll reach more people. It's usually easy to get children to like my music, but I still know nothing about what grown-ups would enjoy. If you ever open your own nursery school, please let me sing there. I’ll be happy to! You laughed! It's the first time I ever saw you laugh. Looks so much better than when you're sad. I really don’t know how to thank you, Dai. You found me my apartment and part-time job. I even got into nursery training thanks to you. Thank you so much! It’s alright, no big deal. A hairpin made out of moonlight and the shimmer of the stars This is a serenade just for you, my one and only Three whiskey mizuwari's. Coming right up. What a beautiful melody. That one’s his top hit. Out of everything, it's titled "Yearning". Maybe he’s in love with someone. ...like an anzu apricot Your puckered face and pouting lips Here you go. Your face looks hazy in the rain What's making your heart ache? If only I could put a stop to the flow of your tears Let me embrace you with my open arms If you don’t want the dreams to end Let’s indulge in fairy tales Your face looks hazy in the rain What's making your heart ache? I got an internship at Maejima Constructions. I’ve come to Tokyo for training. I see. Congratulations. So you’re making a living, while attending nursery training. That’s admirable. Out of respect for your decision to move to Tokyo without telling me, I wasn’t going to meet you. But I’m still a bit worried about you. Did you get the words from Aya? Akane is ill. Akane? About two weeks ago, she fainted at work. The university hospital took her in. What kind of illness? Leukemia. Leukemia? - Anzu? - Anzu! I heard from Togo and hurried back. How is she? The doctor told her to stay at the hospital, but she said it’s nothing serious and checked herself out! Where’s Akane? What’s the fuss about? I’m right here. Akane! Anzu, what brought you back? Feeling homesick? No! Anzu heard about your hospitalization from Togo... Then there’s nothing to worry about. As you can see, I'm alive and kicking. Since you’re already here, you should relax and enjoy Kyoto before you head back. Anzu. What are you waiting for? Let’s go inside. It’s been a while since all of us are together. Let’s eat something good tonight. Oh, great timing by the way. I'll make an important announcement at dinner. What could it be? Aya, so is it true? Is Akane... A girl so talented and kind like her, having to deal with such a cruel fate... It’s hard to believe. Yum! Aya makes the best food. Don’t come complaining if you got chubby eating too much. It’s alright. Worrying about tomorrow steals the joy from today. You’re beyond my reach! Akane, what’s the announcement? Stop making us wait. I’m all ears. Give her a break. It’s probably another one of Akane’s clever jokes. Not this time. This is something serious. A new life is growing inside me. A new life? A baby. Akane... It’s one of her jokes after all! You’re just saying that to prank us, right? Akane, who’s the father? The baby is mine. That’s all I’ll say. No more questions, please. But then, won’t the baby have to go through what we went through? Anzu, you think that’s unfortunate? I’ve always thought I was lucky. And I’m sure my baby will think the same. I’ll try my best to have a boy. Too many girls in the Kitazawa family. Let’s drink to this. As siblings, let's cheers! Akane, congratulations. Thanks. Why didn’t you tell me about the baby? Dr. Iwaki specifically said that your health is not fit for labor. Having the baby could cost your life. If you don’t change your mind right now, there’s no turning back. What on earth are you thinking? He even told me you gave up on radiotherapy to make sure the baby’s safe. You can have as many kids as you want when you’re well again. I will protect my baby. Nobody can get in my way. Akane... You think I can just sit back and watch you destroy yourself? Thanks for worrying about me, Oba. But leave me be, will you? Do you… Do you not love me? Why would you say that? I received the most wonderful gift from God because I met you. I don’t need anything else. I’ll never feel lonely again. And you... Please keep being you. Goodbye. Oba! Anzu? It’s been a while. I’ve just finished my training, and wanted to stop by. I have to take off again soon. I’m going to work on-site at a dam construction for a while. Somewhere deep in Toyama Prefecture. I see. You seem well. You’ve changed quite a lot. You look… mature. You also look like a robust young man now. Anzu. Please take care of Akane for me. Oba... Once I go up to the mountains, it’ll probably be at least a year until I see you again. Anzu, will you go back to Tokyo? Yes, I want to complete the nursery training. Will you keep this for me while I'm away? What’s this? Take a look. Togo... When I come back from the mountains, if you approve of me, please have it on. I thought I could use a cup of coffee. Are you already closed? No. Coming right up. Please, feel free. Very well then, I’ll take two cups. It’s been a while since we had coffee together. If you don’t mind. Last time I was here, it was still a photography studio. Nothing unusual from the inspection today, so I moved Akane to a regular ward. I can’t thank you enough for looking after Akane. Aya. I know it's difficult, but we have to decide on whether to keep the mother or the baby. Please find time to discuss it with Oba, the child’s father. I understand. Sometimes, I really think being a doctor is tormenting, having to break this kind of news to people. Aya. To me, these six years have been tough. I was going to marry you, once I’ve started my internship and you’ve graduated. I had it all planned out in my head. Yet your parents got into that horrible accident, and the plan came to nothing. Aya, you’ve done an incredible job all these years. Will you throw yourself into my embrace once more, like you used to? Iwaki… That was awkward, but I hope you understood that. Yes. I wonder what Anzu is doing right now. If you haven’t heard from her, then she’s probably doing well. But she did say she’s going to come back when the baby is born! What about you? Studying hard? How do I put this… I'm not the brightest among us four, so no college for me. I'm gonna focus on painting. I wanna become a dyeing artisan in the future. Wish me luck! More flowers for you! Miss Kitazawa, you’re a lucky one! Your husband is really showering you with love. Is he away somewhere? I don’t think I’ve met him yet. Well… Wow, those white roses are so pretty! Akane, look! Akane, why won't you see Oba? Have you heard? He’s working hard for you and the baby, and he’ll send you all the money. Maybe I should also find someone like Oba. I… I want to save the baby. Oba... Now I understand. Oba, you really do love Akane with all your heart. The baby will be taken into our family. No matter what, please go on and start a new life. That is what’s worrying Akane the most. It’s too late. We’re already a fully fledged married couple. Ai helped with registering. Ai? Does Akane… She doesn’t know yet. But she knows very well how strong my feelings for fer are. I’m sure she’ll understand. MAY OUR CHILD BE HEALTHY AKANE&RYO Anzu! And? She got moved into the delivery room about an hour ago. Is she gonna be fine? She’ll be fine. Dr. Iwaki is taking care of her. Where’s Oba? I already told him. Dear God.... Please give me... Please give me strength. Oba! Ai. The baby is born! It’s a boy! How’s Akane? She’s fine. Both of them, they’re fine! Akane… Akane! Oba. Quick, go be with Akane. Anzu is here too. Oba... Akane! Akane, the boy's father is here. Akane. It’s me, Ryo. Akane. Ryo... You’ve done a great job. Thank you… Thank you. What are you waiting for? Hurry. Should I... Please stay here for now. We have to take her to the ICU. Here’s the baby! Come take a look. He’s so cute! Looks exactly the same as his dad. Anzu! Oh, it’s a boy? I see, that’s great news. I’m worried about Akane… It’s gonna be alright, Ryo is there for her. Me? I’m doing well. I’m really deep in the mountains, but working with nature is so invigorating. Nature, huh… He’s probably going to forget me in no time. CHAPTER THREE: FAREWELL TO SPRING Up that hill, up this hill... One, two, three, four. Up that hill, up this hill. One, two, three, four... You’re better being in front of the camera, not behind. Ryo! What are you two chatting about? About his dad. So, how’s our son? He’s so perfect. Number one in the world. Too perfect to be my child. It’s like I'm dreaming. Little guy, you hear that? Your mom is talking nonsense again. Got a name yet? Mm-hm. It reads “Kazuto”. No matter how hard his life might get, he’ll be someone who loves and is loved by others. Kazuto. That’s a good name. I’ll turn in his birth certificate today. When you get better, let’s all visit my hometown. It’s a small fishing village called Sado no Ogi. I also grew up listening to the lullabies of the sea. My sea is probably not as warm and calm as yours in Hirado, though. Thank you, Ryo. But I won’t live long enough for that. You’ve shown me so much kindness. In the end, I’ve done nothing for you. I only ever said things like “thank you” and “sorry”. I’ll regret it forever. At least… At least I wanted you to see me in a wedding dress. No, no way Don't you leave me Like fruits coming before flowers Like sprouts coming before seeds Like spring coming after summer Please don't resort to such absurdity I hear it. Akane? What is it? I hear it. I hear it... The sea. When I was little, I used to look at the sea a lot. I want to see it one more time. Akane... Once it gets dark, the stars will look so close to me that I can almost grab them with my hands. Let’s go there. Ryo. I want to see it too. Your Hirado sea. Kazuto, your mom was born here in Hirado. Ask dad to take you here again someday. If only God could give me three more days. If I had a healthy body for three more days... On the first day, I’d spend all day playing with Kazuto. The second day, I'd go to Aya, Anzu, and Ai, to say a proper "thank you", and "goodbye". On the third, Ryo. I’d do nothing but... Nothing but... I’d love to... be with you... all day. Akane? Akane! Is everything alright? She’s... She's just sleeping. I thought about waking her up a few times, but I didn't. I'll let her sleep. She kept smiling even when she wanted to cry the most. She coped with everything... like they were all meant to happen to her. I just want to let her rest peacefully. Who is this girl to you? She’s my wife. This was... the first and last time my wife ever asked for something from me. She said she wanted to see the sea, and the stars of Hirado. No, no way Don't you leave me Delicate like a little bird Yet prideful like high wind You are going to wed No, no way Don't you leave me Falling from this height, it’s quite surprising that there isn't a single scratch on their faces. They were found peacefully leaning against each other. It'd be cumbersome to separate their bodies, so we transported them together. Akane.
