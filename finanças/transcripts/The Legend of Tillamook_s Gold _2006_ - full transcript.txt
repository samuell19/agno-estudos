(gentle music) - [Girl Voiceover] When we moved to Oregon after my dad lost his job things were different. I wish we hadn't moved from LA, there is was always sunny and now it always rains. I didn't like it without my friends and all but I learned to deal. My sister Susan was spending all of her time with her stupid boyfriend Tom, one of my uncle Jimmy's friends. That's great grammy Ruth, sometimes she can be pretty cool. - Hey what time is dinner? - [Ruth] About five. - Okay, see ya then. - [Girl Voiceover] Grandpa Jack was a logger, now he makes his own marionettes, he's pretty good at it. At least it's something to watch when I'm bored. - Hey pops. - oh Great. - Of course. - [Girl Voiceover] Uncle Jimmy's a logger. He thinks he's really cool. But I could argue that. And that's my mom and dad. Enough said. But that was the most amazing summer of my life. Deep within the shadows Just beyond my doubts The answer lies awaiting For me to figure out With every step I take I hope that I'm closer With every spell I breathe I wonder am I Saving up for grace (whistling music) (dramatic music) (laughter) (applause) - Well thanks all for coming. Great, just great. - [Man] Great, thank you. - Thanks. I think it went pretty well. Hi honey. - Grandpa, can I show you what I found. - Yeah, sure. But first, this is Standing Elk. And this is my granddaughter Julie. - Hi Julie. Good to meet you. - So what did you want to show me? - I found this on the beach. - On the beach. - I looked for more but I didn't see any. - Looks like one of those Spanish coins. - Hmm, that looks older than me. - That could be from the treasure. - Like in the story. - What do you mean? What story? - Well, there is an Indian legend. Should we show her? - Sure. It might be a good idea. - Okay, have a seat, and we'll just be a minute. The legend of the Tillamook treasure. (dramatic music) - My people were hunting on the slopes of Neahkahnie Mountain. It was a cloudy day. No storms. They saw a strange craft coming toward the mountain. On board was a slave in chains. We had never seen a black man before. White men carried a large chest up the mountain. The dug a deep hole and put the treasure chest into it. (native music) (speaking foreign language) They killed the slave. And threw his body over the chest to scare people. They marked rocks so they could find it again, and disappeared forever. Hundreds of treasure hunters looked for the chest and all have failed because they were not chosen to find the treasure. No one touches me white woman. My people say that only an Indian can find the treasure. One who is brave enough not to be afraid of the ghost of the slave. Maybe you know the one who is chosen to find the treasure. (applause) - You like it? - Yeah. - Huh? - Where part Indian, right grandpa? I think, I think I'm a sixteenth, or 32nd. - Well I think it's better to be Indian all the time instead of 30 seconds. - My mother told me that you're great great grandmother was Indian. And old Grandma Rose could tell a story, just like this old coot. - Who's an old coot? What's an old coot anyway? - You know I think that there's something that she should see if you, go down the beach to where the stream comes out under the highway, and walk about 10 paces to the northwest. You'll find a rock that's, got numbers on it. People say that it might have something to do with distances to other rocks that are up there in the mountain. The whole mountain's filled with rat holes from treasure hunters being up there. I've dug a few myself. - But you be careful if you go up there. There's a lot of spirits there. (inquisitive music) - Hey kiddo. - Hey dad. You want to see what I found? - Uh huh. Oh that's nice sweetheart. - [Julie Voiceover] Tom broke his arm when he jumped trying to save Agnes, his chainsaw. Jimmy was mad. He said Tom shouldn't have climbed the flagpole with a saw. What a dope. Jimmy was getting in shape for the Jamboree day. He was looking to win the Bull of the Woods title. - Mmmm. Smells like writers block. - Yeah, well, I though maybe we could all come and stay with you, and maybe help you out with mom. Okay. Yeah, okay, dad, I completely understand. Yeah, we might even be a burden. It might, no, no, we're gonna be completely okay. Don't you, don't worry about us. So I'll talk to you later okay. I got to go. I love you. Bye. - Your mom okay? - She's fine. - You okay? - What are we gonna do about all these bills? We have been doing this for 19 years. - I know. But 19 years, we've been figuring it out. - Yeah, barely. - You know the book that I started back in March? I figured out a way to make it sell. - I've heard this before. Robert, I've heard. - Kathryn just listen to me, okay. Neahkahnie Mountain. All of the Indian stories and legends that go along with it. - Indian stories? - Yes. - Robert. - You've never even listened. - Would you just go down and answer the help wanted sign over at the hardware store. - And then what am I supposed to do? Write scintillating stories about the sudden beauties of chainsaws. - [Kathryn] No, you're supposed to bring home a paycheck. - [Robert] You know I left this town because I didn't want to end up like Jimmy. - Jimmy is responsible. - I did not fit in this town when I was a kid Kathryn. And I do not fit into it now. - [Kathryn] You should try. You're gonna have to do something. Rehearsals. Somebody has got to bring home something. - [Robert] Oh, there we go again. - Do you think that maybe you could go and get off your butt, and clean up the dishes around here? - Maybe you should've married a lumberjack? Tell me that you're mine Say that I'm more than divine - Now I got to find myself a new partner for the Jamboree. I don't intend to lose just cause somebody got yourself busted up. - How about dad? - Hey, what about Robert? - What about Robert? - Want to be my corner man? - No. - Your Kathryn's right little brother. You need to take responsibility and get a job like your big bro. - You were eavesdropping? - Those are thin walls. - [Robert] You can blame this dump - [Jimmy] This is my dump, you ingrate. - [Robert] Please Jimmy, you like it here. - Hey, if it wasn't to stay in the woods and work when you went off to school. - [Robert] I didn't have a choice. - [Jimmy] Mom needed help while she was dying. - [Robert] Jimmy, that wasn't fair. Say that I'm more than just a Say that I'm more than just a passing time Say that I'm yours And tell me that you're mine Say that I'm more than divine - This is my house. And you are free to go whenever you want. - Hey. - I got a new puppet. - It's funny, cause so does Jimmy. (somber music) - [Julie Voiceover] I had the feeling that elk wanted me to see where then stream went underground. (upbeat music) I could tell that this was the elk's home. There was one place where the grass was all matted down. Is this your bed? It's still warm. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - [Man] You are my freedom. - [Julie Voiceover] When I woke up, it was almost dawn. I felt like I was floating. Like I had been sleeping for days. (dramatic music) (dog growls) (dramatic music) - Skittish little tack, ain't she. (alarm rings) - [Kathryn] Julie. Susan. - [Julie Voiceover] Oh no. (knock on the door) - Good morning sunshine. Rise and shine. It's Jamboree day. I want you to wear something really pretty. A pretty dress for Grammy Ruth. You're hot. You're really hot. I told you not to sleep under so many blankets. Let's go everybody. Jamboree day. (cheers) - Sit down. - [Announcer] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this year's logging Jamboree. Who will win the golden double jacks of this years bore the witch competition. Hello boys, duck in a hailstorm. Look at that old boy throw. - Smiley recognizes you. (dog growls) - What's this? - That's an old Spanish coin, late 1500s. - Did you find it on the beach? - Now why do you say that? - Nothing, I just wanted to know if it was local. - Right. Hey kid, what's your name? - Julie. What's yours? - Billie. Billie Stahl. - [Announcer] Loggers to the river for the matchstick competition in the boon run. Loggers to the river. Get ready to get wet. - Morning Jimmy. - Hey Spike. - That old boy Spike, he runs like he got Tabasco in his britches. But you'll probably win Jimmy. Except, you're a might more likely to fall. - Why do I hang out with you? Why? Robert should be getting ready by now. I'm gonna break his neck if he screws this up. - There you are. - Thank you. - Hey, how are you? - Good. - Usual? My favorite customer. One chocolate on the house. See you later. - Oh wow. - You like it? - It's perfect. - It's yours. - Have you seen that elk? - I just draw what's in my head. - Thank you. - Robert, Jimmy said you better get your butt over and get ready. - Robert's new corner man? How'd that happen? - I got my arm all busted so I couldn't do it. - How'd you bust up your arm sweetie? - It's a long story Grammy. - Anyway, I says what about Robert. - I told him I'm not good at that stuff. - You know Jimmy, he usually gets what he wants. - Yeah, I know Jimmy. He usually does. - Well this will be good. (upbeat music) - Come on Jimmy. (uplifting music) - On the good side, you didn't lose by that much this year. You made it most of the way before deciding to swim. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, hot saws are next. Hot saws to the pits please. Hot saws to the pits. - Cecile's ready. - She's hot to trot. - Let's go. - [Announcer] Next up is Jimmy Kimbell, with his motorcycle engine hot saw Cecile. Is he gonna ride her or saw her? (saw buzzing) (cheers) Hooey! Fastest time yet. Blazing hot three point nine seconds. Bullseye for Igmar Spike Johanson. - [Man] Okay Jimmy. - [Announcer] Now Jimmy Kimbell. Oh, nice throw Jimmy, but not good enough. Igmar Spike Johanson showing his trademark underhand throw. But that's not good enough. No cigars Spike. Here comes Jimmy. It's a bullseye for Jimmy Kimbell. (cheers) - Go Jimmy. - [Announcer] Jimmy and Spike go into the pole cutting all tied up. Pole cutting will determine who's bull of the woods. First up is Igmar Spike Johanson. The object is to fell the pole and hit the can. Simple huh? No, not so simple. They have to make sure the pole is cut correctly. A bad cut could be dangerous in the woods. And there's Spike. And he hits the can. Nice cut for Igmar Spike Johanson. The cut was good, so now it's all up to Jimmy Kimbell. Can he do it. This is for the whole shooting match. The whole kit and caboodle. Bows to his corner man, he says he has a brother from, hold on, California. Jimmy got Mickey Mouse to help him. Now see what happens. Oh, tough luck. Jimmy not only missed the can, but his cut was bad. Must not have had too much pole felling there at Disneyland, huh. - Too bad about your corner man. Better luck next year. - Thanks Igmar. - [Announcer] Ladies and Gents. The winner of this year's Golden Double for the X, Bull Award Igmar Spike Johanson. (uplifting music) (fireworks) (Native American singing) - Hi Julie. This is Looking Wolf. - I've been trying to figure something. - What is it? - If the Indians knew where the gold was, why didn't they take a dime? - We do not wish to disrespect any brave man's resting place. - What about the gold? - What do we want with gold? - To buy stuff. - We already had stuff. We had the ocean. We had the fish. We had the elk. We had the mountains. We shared all the land. There are many of us at one time, and then very soon, there were very few. But our ancestors gave us the strengths to survive. - (speaking foreign language) Oh my relations. - All my relations. In our way, when a girl is your age, the medicine man asks her to go on a quest. - A quest? Like a mission. - A vision quest. To find her power. - Where would she find it? - From everywhere on mother earth, father sky. (native flute and singing) - [Man] You are my freedom. (foreign language). (uplifting music) - Where's that Julie? (somber music) - What are you doing? (screams) Let's go. - Hey, what's wrong? Come on. - She's just being a stupid little kid. Come on, let's go. - Knock it off. Come on. (jovial music) - Pass the peas please. - Hungry uncle Jimmy? - Julie close your mouth when you chew. - Jimmy doesn't. - Don't talk back to me. - By the way, Joe says they're closing the restaurant down for the winter. - Well that's probably because he won't have your smiling face around any more. Not now that our little girl has just been accepted to Oregon State. - Wow. - I haven't decided yet honey, but, - Pass the gravy sweetie. - What do you mean? - The gravy. - I'm thinking about it. - Nothing to think about, just pass it. - There's the gravy. - You're not gonna spend the rest of your life being a waitress in this town. - We're gonna be back in California before the school year starts, right dad? - Yeah, we're talking about it. - Can I have some more beans? Your wife is a great cook. I haven't eaten this well in years. - Kathryn, we never at this well before you came. - Thank you. - What did Grammy Ruth cook for you? Slop? - You don't know what you got here little brother. - One more load of garbage to the pits. Come on Tom, we're gonna miss our show. - As my ma used to say, eat it before we give it to the pigs. - I'm sure glad you liked it Tom. - He's a little wet behind the ears. - I'm the one who's chosen. And I'm gonna find the treasure. Then they'll be no more arguments about money. (invigorating music) Elk spirit, seer of all things, guardian of the mountain, show me the treasure. - Julie, where have you been? - Kite flying. - You're filthy. Go inside and get cleaned up. You are a mess. - You know we can afford for you to use a little soap. - I tried using my kite to find the treasure. It didn't work. - I used to use a forked stick to look for treasure. - Did you ever find any? - All the time. - Really? - Oh yeah. Yeah, just never dug it up. - Dad. - [Julie Voiceover] I heard the treasure rocks were at the Pioneer's Museum. (horn blows) I hurried to take the train down to Tillamook before it closed. (easy music) - Hi Ms. Stahl. I was wondering if I could look at could look at the treasure rocks. - Let me show you this genuine replica of a tree. One of the early settlers lived in their first winter. - Are the rocks in here. - The pioneers' created the history here. - Are the rocks here? - You're like a dog with a bone. They're downstairs. - But if the rocks have been moved, how does anyone know where they point to? - This is the genuine Spanish beeswax that people found washed up on the beach. - If the rocks have been moved, how does anyone figure out what they mean? - Oh it doesn't mean anything in regards to treasure. It's part of a survey, to measure the land. But you can't tell that to old Glad. He got a permit from the state, and is down there digging on the beach. - Digging for what? - For gold. (laughs) Can you imagine how stupid he is thinking there's gold on the beach. - So what do you mean a survey? - Oh well all those Spanish wanted to find the Columbia River. The early civilized explorers thought that finding the river would mean finding the northwest passage between the Pacific and the Atlantic. - So who owns the treasure? The Spanish? - The treasure smeasure. If there were a treasure, it would belong to the museum. And anyone who finds it, should bring it to me. - But what if someone found a gold coin or something? - Who? - No, I don't know, just suppose. So how could I find out where the rocks were to begin with? I mean I'd like to look for fun. - Treasure hunting is hard work. And dangerous, not fun. - Can I please see the rocks now? - Sorry, Julie, it's closing time. Come another time if you'd like. But there's nothing learned from them rocks. (phone ringing) hello. Right. I got a little held up. I'm on my way. (dramatic music) - [Billie] Come on Smiley. (dramatic music) Smiley, you're always in such a hurry, you make me forget my knife. (dog whimpering) I've got to sharpen this puppy tonight. Smiley? What are you doing down there? You crazy dog, hush up now. (dog growling) There's nothing down here Smiley. Get up here. Smiley, come on now. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - [Man] You are my freedom. (speaking foreign language) You are chosen. (church bells) - Well you're out early, or is it late? Get in, I'll take you home. - [Kathryn] Julie. (knock on the door) It's time to get up sleepy head. Breakfast is ready, and your dad's waiting for you. Start moving. Get up. Let's go. - [Susan] Where were you Julie? - Morning Sam. - That was some Jamboree wasn't it. - Yeah. - It was really a shame about Jimmy losing his Bull of the Woods to ax and all. - Yeah. - Well what can I do you for? - Oh, I need some putty for the wood stove please. - Let's see, it's down here. - I saw that sign you had outside. - Yep. I got a sign. - Do you need some help around here? - Help's got to demand respect from the old boys. - Dad. - Can I get these? - Ah, yeah sure sweetie. - Are you talking about the Jamboree? - No, I heard they're hiring at the insurance brokerage. You're kind of job. The desk and everything. - You ever write about insurance? - No. No, I wrote news stories, and screenplays. I read about insurance sometimes. - So do I, every chance I get. Trying to give up smoking. I'm having a hard time with it. I'm writing my memoirs. I call it double oh eight. Insurance agent man. I could use some help with it from a professional. So what makes you think you'd be the best person for this job? - Honestly, I don't even know why I'm here. - You and the little lady need life insurance? You don't have the job you know. - Hey, how'd it go? - Swell, just swell. - Hold these. - Thanks. - Oh, do you have any time to set me up on your computer? - Sweetheart, I've got nothing but time. - About freaking time. Hello lady. You like watching men work, don't you. Come back in a couple hours, I'm gonna find the Tillamook treasure chest. - How'd you know where to dig? - Got me a partner. Billie Stahl. Works up there at that museum. She tells me where to dig. We're this close to it now. - Wait, can you tell me where the rocks were before they were moved. (jovial music) - Ever seen a smiling dog before? Yeah, it scares the bejesus out of people, if you could imagine. You can pet him. Where the hell is your father? I said where? Oh no. Not again. - Billie. Hey. Nothing yet, but I feel lucky. Uh oh. - How the heck are you planning on getting out of there, Einstein? - I got carried away again, didn't I? - It's mostly just weird shapes and numbers. - Maybe there's just something you're missing. Let's start with the measurements that the Spaniards used in the 1500s. - Well. I've already converted the distances to feet. - Oh you're good. You're very good. - Well, there's some good stuff here, but I'm not sure the rocks mean anything. - Yeah. Wonder if there's anything on Tillamook. - Plenty here if you're interested in cows and cheese. - What do you think the treasure could be? - Gold. Well just because why else would the Spaniards bother to carry it all the way up the mountain. Gold coins. - Yeah, I'm with you on that. Then we can simulate possible scenarios where the dirt accumulates or erodes since the treasure was buried. - How are we going to do that? - We're gonna start with this picture that I scanned of the mountain. Okay. Good. Alright, see these markers indicate logical locations to check. Print that up for you. - And it probably wouldn't hurt if you spoke to a Native American who was familiar with the legend. You know maybe Grandpa Jack's buddy, Standing Elk. He might help. Now here we go. Your hunting papers. - Hey little one. - Hey Standing Elk. Hey Grandpa. - Hi sweetheart. Come on in. - Yeah this one. - So what'd you find out? Anything? - Not really. You know that mountain's magic. I've seen elk up there. - Would you mind coming over and helping an old elk over here, get some of that beef stew for me. - So you know about Grandpa's elk puppet. - It's because of that story that my name is Standing Elk. - Really? - That black prisoner saw an elk drowning in the water. The black prisoner who's hands were bound grabbed that elk by the antlers and held his head up above the water until they got to shore. - What happened to him? - Some people say that elk is still up there trying to help that black prisoner get back to the sea. What do you think of that? - I've seen that elk. - Some people say that elk is just a legend. Maybe you should spend you time on other things instead of chasing ghosts. - Well I can't stop now. You mean I'm his freedom. - You are? Who's freedom? - I wish in knew where the rocks were before they were moved. - Maybe you don't need the rocks. The didn't help anyone else. Old Coyote said we catch more rabbit by think about where they will be but aren't. - That's a great idea. Thank you. - It is? - Bye grandpa. - Bye sweetheart. Where they will be but aren't? - I didn't say that. Coyote said it. I never did know what it meant. - So. Did your dad find the treasure? - No. He never does. Say that I'm more than just a passing time - [Robert] I sat here, had a nice conversation. Say that I'm yours And tell me that you're mine Say that I'm more than divine (parents fighting in background) - [Julie Voiceover] I had a secret spot that I liked to go to when mom and dad got like this. I liked to watch the moon. - Hello? Robert, I'm here. I'll start setting up. - [Julie Voiceover] I found that it helps to have a good sense of balance. - Hey. You ready to get skinned? I've been waiting for this rematch for a long time. - [Robert] Oh have you? - [Grandpa] Uh huh. - [Robert] Looking forward to it. - Uh huh. So how you doing? - Did you, hear any of that? Okay, good. - You ready for this? Bam. You are not playing worth a damn tonight. - Things aren't going too well for me right now, pop. - Yeah. Yeah, I used to play as bad as you are playing. - I'm not playing that badly. - Yeah you are. I was just like you, you know, I'd be so focused on my opponents king, that I'd have to get his knight, so I'd end up losing my bishop. But then I'd get so hung up on that, that I'd, I lost my queen. I mean you always used to say that chess was an unfolding story, right. Well pretty hard to win without your queen. - I'll deal with it, alright. - In basketball, you had a great outside shot. You usually got double teams, but while you were watching, the waiving arms in front of you, - The basket. Look at you sitting there being a dad again. - [Grandpa] Okay. - [Robert] Okay. - Ha ha, checkmate. - No, God, how do you make it look so easy? - Oh, it ain't easy. But keep playing. - What the? (screams) - [Both] Julie! - Um, I, a, I, I was on my way to the bathroom, and took a wrong turn. - Right. - So what are you going to do if I leave? - What do you mean? - Well, umm, I'll be gone. And it looks like you'll still be here when school starts. - We better not be. - You know mom and dad aren't doing so hot. - I hate the way she's so nice to Jimmy. "Oh Jimmy, won't you come stay for dinner?" "Of course I will, you're the best cook, "and the prettiest." "Oh Jimmy, you flatter me." - Cut it out. Mom's working pretty hard, and is warn out. And dad can be difficult sometimes. He won't even talk to her. - Well maybe he would if she was a little nicer. - Well I just thought it would be hard for you if they split and you're stuck here. - Split? - I heard them talking about it yesterday. - What are we gonna do? - I'm sorry Jules. I'm getting out. I'm sick of listening to them argue and of having no money. I can't take it anymore. - I wish I was going to college. - At 14? - I could live with you. - Come on. You're a dork. Tom's coming. I don't let it go I lost myself To your ways She already won Your heart again - Big finish. (laughter) - Oh my God. Where did you get that? - And who are you supposed to be? - I am the newest recruit of the Manzanita Ocean Rescue team. - Whoa! - Where's my camera? I have to get my camera. (laughter) - Wow. Does it pay? It pays doesn't it? - It pays. Yes. I might have to you know get a little stronger, build up my upper body strength, but they've got a gym right there at the station, I can do it there. - Dad. - Who would have thought. I'm so excited. - Hang on. Wait for it. (laughter) - Hey little brother. Somebody trying to make a man out of you? Or a fish? - Well I'll be working nights. If I give up sleep, I can get some writing done. - I think you look cute. - Thank you. - Cute, that is exactly the word I was thinking. - 1500 bucks a month for just hanging out, and getting in shape. And if I'm lucky, I get to rescue somebody. Break up the monotony. - Wait, does this mean we're staying in Manzanita? - Honey, let's just wait and see. - Hey little brother, a real man needs a real rig. It's outside. You're gonna love it. Now that's a man's ride Bobby. - Wow. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What? Nobody ever gave me a car. - That's it. - You're kidding. Oh, Eddie, thanks. I appreciate it. Tell Mel how you fixed that for me, huh. - Why was he here? - Hello daughter. He was helping me fix the computer. Mel sent him over. - You don't get it, do you? He's with them. - Hey, how was today? How did it go? - Want number 25? It's a huge pit. Someone's already dug up there. And number 28 is solid rock. - Well, that then knocks out your number nine and 10. Guess. What if you asked Billie Stahl at the museum. Maybe she know where the rock marker locations are. - She's looking for the treasure too. With Eddie's dad. - Oh. Eddie's, yeah. Still I think we could really narrow it down if we knew those locations. - Billie's hiding something. - Hey gorgeous. As usual. - Yeah. - Happy birthday Freddie. - Thank you. - I am so sorry. - Don't. Look what you did to my shirt. I know what all of you are up to. - That kid came around again today. She wanted the rock locations. I didn't give them to her. - Why, isn't that your job? - No one cares about the rocks except her. - Maybe you don't have to worry cause there isn't any treasure. - There is a treasure. - Sometimes I think it'll never be found. - I'll find it, it's mine, and I'm gonna find it. - I thought it was ours. Yeah, I got an idea. We should make her a map. - And give her the clues? - You don't have to be 100% right. We all make mistakes. - Sure. - You guys, that's not fair. She's just a kid. - Oh, she's just a kid. I think someone's got the hots for that little girl. (laughter) (guitar playing) - Hey. - Hi. - Nice guitar. - Thanks. - Still looking for that treasure? - Why do you want to know? - I don't know. Just thought I'd give you a hand, if you'd like me. I mean if you'd like me to help. - I'm fine thanks. - Okay. Well gotta go. You know. I've got lots to do. You know that map my dad and Billie gave you? - Yeah, what about it? - I just wouldn't trust it. I wouldn't want you to waste too much time on it. I gotta go. - Yeah, got lots to do. - Yeah. (guitar strumming) - Okay, so I took all of the pictures you gave me of the mountain. And. - That's so cool. Listen sweetheart, I would love to stay on this, but this is the only time I get to write, so. - Well did the information I got from Billie's map help us with anything? - Yes, I printed out a new icon map for you but there's something wrong. - What do you mean? - Well these icons indicate locations that are way out in the water, and I don't think the shoreline has changed that much. Even using the oldest picture that we have, it looks like the shoreline's pretty much the same. It's only eroded just a little bit. - Do you think she gave me false locations? - Maybe, but not on purpose. - I bet she did. I'm gonna get her fired. - Hey, hey, slow down. Billie's lived here all her life. You, young lady, have just arrived. - This is driving me nuts. Why are you wasting all of this time encouraging Julia in this silly treasure hunt? Maybe I should just move out. Probably wouldn't even notice. And where are you going? Where is she going? - Out it seems. - I like this part. Watch. - Susan, you're gonna have to come home early tonight. You got work tomorrow. - Actually, Tom and I thought we'd stay in tonight, didn't we Tom? - We've got something to tell you. Some really happy news. - Uh oh. Last time Tom had happy news, he thought he'd found Bigfoot's hideout. Turned out to be a bear's den. - Shh, go ahead Tom. - There comes a time in a man's life when he needs more than beer, and fishing, and hunting, and that time has come for me. Susan's going to be the oil in my chain. The cocks in my boots. My partner in the three legged race of life. - What the hell are you talking about? - Oh my God. Oh my God. - The oil on your chain? - I was trying to show them my poetic side for you sugar. As someone once said, there's nothing to fear but fear itself. - We're engaged. - I'm not done yet. - Oh my God. They're getting married Robert. - I heard. - She's just 18. Unless there's no other option. - No, no, no, it's not that. - Tom. - No, it's not that. Look I now you may think that we're rushing into this a bit, but we think this is the best thing all around. - Tom. - It's a far better thing that I do this today, - Tom. - [Robert] Tom. The best thing all around for who? - He's not good enough for you? He earns an honest paycheck. More than I can say for some people. - No wonder you were voted meanest son of a bitch in high school. - And I remember all those laurels you racked up there Robert. Captain of the computer club. You were voted dweeb of the year. Nobody knew who you were. They still don't despite all the stuff you write. Nobody reads it. - People read his stuff. - Who? - The newspaper at a very big circulation. - Among? - Jimmy, why don't you get a wife to kick around? You know like your last one. - I did kind of wear her out. - You know I can't believe you're gonna throw your life away. I'd give anything to be going to college instead of living here. - Julie. - And it's bad enough we have to live here, but do you two have to fight all the time. - Julie, please calm down. - Mom. You're the worst of them. - Do not talk to your mother like that. - [Julie] Where's your loyalty? - Can somebody listen to me please? - Hey, could you get me a beer? - [Julie] Get it yourself you lazy bum. (somber music) - There you are. We've been looking everywhere for you. Hey, I'm sorry that your life has been so rough lately. You want to talk? - Are we staying here? I'll run away if we stay in Oregon. - Things will get easier once my play closes sweetie. You know I've been so busy with rehearsals, and trying to keep the house up for Jimmy, and. - You like Jimmy don't you? - Yes. Of course I like Jimmy. - Duh. He's not real obvious. - What are you saying? Jimmy is letting us stay in his house. You could try to be a little more grateful. - You don't have to act like you do. It's mortifying. - Why did you say that? Hey I asked you a question. - I want to know what's going on. - I wish I knew. Listen, try to keep yourself busy, okay. All of us are going through a really rough time, and, we need your help. Shall we go in? - Whatever. - Jules. Hey. Come here. (bouncy music) - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Dig. - Do you want you're bed back? Would you like some salt? (bouncy music) (banging) - Billie. Billie. Billie. Billie, Billie, Billie. I hit something. - Oh, yahoo. I knew it. Get back in there. Dig. (screams) - Billie. Billie. Billie, I found the body. And umm, I found. - You idiot. - [Julie Voiceover] It was time for me to take Standing Elk's advice and go on a vision quest. I needed some inspiration and power if I was going to succeed. I didn't know how to do a vision quest. But I figured that this 500 year old tree might be a good place to start. (native music) (whispering windy Voice) (native music) (voice whispering in foreign language) (wolf howls) - [Slave] You are my freedom. (speaking foreign language) (native singing) - [Standing Elk] We had the ocean. The mother earth, and father sky. - [Slave] Embrace your fear. Trust in yourself. (native flute) (speaking foreign language) never give up. You are chosen. Trust in yourself. Embrace your fear. - Hey dad. - Hey. - Hi baby. You sure were up out and early this morning. - Yeah, well the early owl catches the mouse. - Are you all right? - Yeah. Never been better. Never ever, never. I'm gonna take a nap. - That's a new one. - Hey sweetie, you're dad called. Said there's a big storm coming. Julie, why are you gonna take up your whole summer playing with that. - Where they should be, but aren't. - Treasure is just a myth. It doesn't exist. - How could the treasure that's buried so close to the surface, just disappear? Maybe this old may was right. Maybe the stream was above ground. Something must have caused the river to go underground. Like an earthquake or something. What if they had buried it next to the stream. What if that rock pointed to where the treasure was. Then maybe the treasure didn't get dug up cause it moved down with the stream. That's it. - What's it? - It was right there all along mom. I've got it. - You got what? What are you doing with that stuff? You can't go out there. - There's no time to lose, mom. - You can't go out there Julie. Julie. You are gonna be in so much trouble. Get back here. (dramatic music) - Oh thank God. Julie ran out of here a little while ago with her flashlight. She said something about finding it. - And you let her go? In this? Why didn't you stop her? - I tried to stop her. I tried. But you know Julie. - You're her mother. - I told her not to go. What could I have done. - You should have just done it. - Oh no. - Sorry. sorry, it's okay. (somber music) - I got to get dad. (screams) - It's okay. Do you know where she went? - No I don't know. She was just looking at the computer, and then she just ran out. She just left. She just left. Where have you been? - some idiot tried to surf today. We had to pull him out. He barely made it. Oh my God. Oh she is a smart girl. She figured it out. - What? What did she figure out? - Just stay here, alright, in case she comes back. I'll call you as soon as I find her. - Oh where are you? - Help. - Hey Robert, what are you doing up here? Weather ain't fit for a greased duck. - I'm looking for Julie. Have you seen her? - Logs have jammed up the river down there. Water's coming up faster than a bad oyster. - Have you seen Julie? She's got to be down there somewhere? - Julie? Down there? I sure hope not. - Man, I gotta check. (screams) (chains clanking) - It's him. - [Slave] (speaking foreign language) You are my freedom. (screams) (Spanish music) - No, no, you've got to be kidding me. Julie. Julie. Julie. Julie. It's me. - Dad. - Don't move. Stay there. I'm coming to you. Julie don't. Julie. Almost there kiddo. - Dad. Dad. Dad. - Kathy? Have you heard anything? Oh, oh. - [Slave] Never give up. You are chosen. Embrace your fear. (native music) - Yeah, hi, this is Julie Kimbell. My dad, he fell off the cliff, down the waterfall. He's in the ocean. Just hurry, please hurry. (sirens) - Where is he? - He's out there. - So how long has he been in the water? - [Slave] You are my freedom. (speaking foreign language) Freedom. - [Kathryn] Come on girls. Come on. Oh honey. Be careful. Get on in. How bad? - He's unconscious, but breathing. - Meet us at the hospital. - I'll go with Jimmy. Jimmy come on. - Why are they taking so long? - I'm sorry mom. I should have listened to you. I'm so stupid. No, what if he. - It's okay. You didn't know. You just didn't know. - He is going to be okay. He's been falling off of things since he was a kid. - Robert was stupid to go in that cave. - Jimmy shut up. What your father did was a very brave, and he loves you very much. - That's fine, you call security. - You need to do that. - I rousted him for you. - Sorry for the delay. We're short staffed today, and your husband well, they say he went over the falls into the ocean, is that right? - Yeah. - He must have had someone watching out for him. - He did. - He's a little disoriented, but he should be fine after some rest. - He went over the falls. Can't kill a Kimbell. That's my little brother. - Hey. I, I was just wondering if maybe you'd want to go to the beach? Or something? - It's Eddie. He wants me to go to the beach. - It's so cute. - Stop. Go. Okay, I'll be right out. Oh my gosh. The beach. Well that would explain why he's following me all the time. Thought it was because he was spying on me for his dad. - What a surprise. He actually likes you for you. Shock. - Oh, I know. That reminds me, where is Tom been lately? Are we out of food? - We broke it off. - You broke it off? - Summer's over, time to move on. - How do I look? - Great. - Okay. I wonder why Whenever I see you Every time that I see you - [Julie] When things settled down, everything wasn't perfect. This family is. But things were getting better. We stayed in Manzanita. Dad even wrote a story about the treasure hunt. - You know how amazing it is that that gold was that close. So many people have searched for that gold and you found it. It's as if that gold coin found it's way to you. - Yeah well, it did didn't it. - You have changed. - Yeah. - To bad you lost all the gold. - it doesn't matter. I mean, at first I wanted us to be famous, and rich too, so you and mom will quit fighting. - We're not fighting. Who's fighting? - Is there a fight? - Do you see anybody fighting? - No fighting. - Listen I heard about a treasure down in Sea Lion cave. You want to go check it out? - No thank you. No thank you. I got these. It's good enough for me. - Oh there is is. - There's her dance. The happy dance. - There it is, they happy dance. What's the water like, cold? - Freezing. - Oh I bet it is. - What are you doing? I don't want to get wet. - [Julie Voiceover] I've never seen the elk, or the African man again. I guess I'll always be a treasure hunter in one way or another. I'd never hunt for the rest of those gold coins. I don't think they'll ever be found. All I know, is that I found my real treasure that summer in Manzanita. Oh I forgot. Eddie told me Billie and Clyde are still looking for the treasure. (bouncy music) - [Billie] Here we go. No. You turn around. Otherwise we're just not doing it. Come on. Come on, do it. - [Julie Voiceover] They'll probably never stop looking. - [Billie] Doofus. When I open up my eyes And I see the shining sun How I'll climb the balcony And I can see the whole shine I can go up anywhere That I want to go I just need to call downstairs Have them pull up my limo Gonna step outside Flashing lights everywhere I can hear my name Shining back from over there I want to be famous Famous I want to be I want to be Famous Famous I won't be complaining When I'm famous - I had a really good time. Stop. Whatever. Bedazzled. Pound it. (laughter) - Bye. When I go shopping I'm gonna buy goods If I know me, Wherever I go - How do you bust up your arm sweetie? - Well you see, me and Agnes. - It's a long story grammy. - It's a story. Anyway, Jimmy and me was talking, and I said what about Swingendorf? He's a strong son of a gun. - I know he's strong. But he made you look like a frickin Einstein. - Gram. - That's what Jimmy says. Said we couldn't risk him messing up. - Remember the time he got kicked by the deer. - Yeah. - Wait, how'd the deer kick him? - In the usual way. - Which is? - Well, old Swingendorf, he shot this here buck, and thinking that his daddy's start lashing his legs together. Then the deer comes to, and starts thrashing about. Old Swing of course, he gets himself all tangled up in the ropes, so they was tied together. And then the deer, he he starts kicking his legs like he's trying to do a four hoof tap dance on old Swing's head. And then Swing was screaming, and then the deer was bleeding, and he's a horrible sight. You can imagine, right. - I'm trying to. - Better not to think about it honey. 20 cars in my garage I'll high five hometown people My dreams not far away I want to have it up today I wrote this song Sing along And make it all come true I want to be famous Famous I want to be I want to be I want to be Famous Yeah Famous I want be complaining No no, Famous I want to be I want to be, I want, want to be Famous Famous Oh yeah yeah Famous I won't be complaining When I'm famous I want to be famous When I'm famous I want to be famous When I'm famous When we were young We couldn't know The road we take How far we'd go And just so glad We took it slow When things get better everyday Things get better everyday You pick me up When I get down It never fails To turn me around And every time I've always found That things get better everyday Okay Things get better everyday When we're apart for very long It's hard to take Hard to take Brightens my day When I see your smile Being with you makes it all worthwhile As years go by I hope you're seeing Each day with you is heaven to me It's good to know That you agree That things get better everyday Okay Things get better everyday Alright Things get better everyday Things get better (rock music)
