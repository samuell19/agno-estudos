And you didn't see anyone else enter the house. No, I did not. What were you doing outside? As I said before... I went to look for sinkers out in the barn. Then, I stopped to eat a pear. A pear? From our pear tree. Then, I came inside. Are you... quite sure you can continue? Yes, I'm fine. To your knowledge, did your father have any enemies? Yes? The new housemaid, ma'am. Bridget. Sullivan. In this house, you will be referred to as Maggie. Most of your duties will be confined to the first floor. Our bedroom... door remains locked during the day, and the two girls, my step-daughters, Emma and Lizzie, they're very private. You are not to access this floor unless expressly directed. - Do you understand? - I do, ma'am. It's actually quite cozy in here. Feel free to bring some things of your own. That will make you feel more at home. Thank you. Within reason, of course. You'll have to excuse me. I'd completely forgotten she'd put you in here. Such an awful little room. We have possessions stashed all over the house. Not enough closet, I'm afraid. My name's Lizzie. Call me Maggie, miss. None of that Maggie or Paddy business. Just picking a name out of a hat for every boy or girl that comes from a certain place? It's terrible. What's your proper name? It's Bridget. Your hairpin's loose, Bridget. There. Thanks, Miss Lizzie. That's a pretty dress. Will you be going somewhere in it? As planned and discussed, I'm going to the theater. You will not leave this house unaccompanied. I leave this house unaccompanied everyday, father. You heard me, Lizzie. And you me, father. The theater's my only respite from this place. You're a Borden. You can't turn up there on your own. The whole town will be there. Yes, they will. And so will I. - I tell you this out of kindness, Lizzie. You are not helping your cause. Perhaps not, but I will go nonetheless. Sit down. Stop! Midnight. No later. Thank you, father. Hello, Lizzie. Hello. Your dress is very smart. And yours is quite blue. We were wondering, why does your family keep the house so dark? Father doesn't believe in light. Why live that way when you can afford not to? He finds it extravagant. There's always gaslight, isn't there? You seem obsessed with the concept of illumination. Are you, by chance, an Edison? You know who I am. Oh, the face is familiar. Perhaps it's your scent that's throwing me off. Hang onto her! Thank you, Maggie. - That's all. - Is she all right? Is there anything for it? As we discussed before, medical options are limited. It's just one of her spells, father. She'll be good as new in the morning. Is she under any undue stress? You know she's always been very emotional. You're all right now. You're all right. Am I... Shh, just rest now, OK? Everything will be fine. Everything's gonna be fine. Say it like you mean it. Everything will be fine. It will, Lizzie. It will. Nothing at all? It really is difficult to harbor sympathy for someone who will not make even the slightest effort to help herself. Hello, Henry. What should we hear today? Do you have any suggestions? Love alters not with brief hours and weeks, but bears it out... Let me not to the marriage of true mind's impme... impediments... Pardon me. Impediments. It's a much nicer word for &quot;obstacle, &quot; don't you think? Have you had schooling? Some. How much is some? Couple years. Are you afraid? Afraid? Of what? Men don't have to know things, Bridget. Women do. It's called... That... Girl. Her... Her hood... is... of the... com... Common... - Common - Common. Common Her hood is of the common. Her hood is of the common sort. Her... Miss. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You sure? - Yeah, it's passed. - Maybe we should stop. I'm fine. I never know when they're gonna happen. Let's carry on. Her dress... Afternoon, Maggie. Afternoon, Mr. Borden. I just, uh, wanna let you know that... We all think you're going a... fine job here. Thank you, sir. Do you find your room comfortable? Yes, sir. It can get quite hot up there. I don't mind, sir. Sometimes, it's best to leave the door open. Let the air circulate. I'm very grateful to be here. Perhaps you could do with a raise. A small raise. That's very kind of you, Sir. Well. Wouldn't wanna lose you. Be a sweet girl, Maggie. It's all right. I see you've taken over my hiding place. Not hiding. No? No. Just... Taking a rest, that's all. I brought you something. I marked a few I thought you might start with. Show yourself! Perhaps it's time we tell the constable about these threats. It's our affair, and it will remain that way. Father, have you done something? I only mean... Some of the land you've recently acquired... We have acquired, Lizzie. We. They're simple farmers. They don't understand what's happened to their holdings. Perhaps... Perhaps if they had made good on their loans, the land would still be theirs. Have I done something? Your arrogance borders on the stupefying. You and your desperate attempts to play the society major. You gossip with them, don't you? You talk about me, and you talk to their husbands, and it's all a game. No, father... Your wanton displays, your public spells. You lay us open to ridicule and attack. We are vulnerable now, Lizzie. Do you not see that that's because of you? Yes, you must be right. I know you want to proceed conservatively, but with your land holdings tripling these past few years, we will need additional support. A large facility would be a wise investment. - I don't want to spend any more than necessary. - -I know. If there's one thing I know about you, Andrew, every nickel spent is a nickel missed. You mean every penny. Oh, Lizzie. Uh, come and say hello to your uncle John. He's come a long way. Out on the town? Abby, John and I have work to do. - If you don't mind - Yes, of course. Come along now, Lizzie. Lizzie. Close the door, please. I can manage. Something I'd like you to see, John. All in the same hand? They are. I worry for the girls, mostly. Some nights, I barely sleep. You believe these threats are genuine? It's time I put my affairs in order. If something's gonna happen to me... Oh, don't talk nonsense. The girls will need looking after. Someone to guard and maintain their finances, as you've always suggested, John. Woah, um... Ah, your girls, they've never taken to me. Emma, maybe, but... Lizzie... No. They know nothing of the matters of the world. Especially Lizzie. How's her health? If you don't mind my asking. Worse. Dr. Bowen recommends institutionalization, but... the thought of sending her away... Though, it may be... inevitable. This is why I need someone to operate on their behalf without sentiment. I know it's an imposition. Will you do that for me, John? Will you promise me? I promise. I'll try. I'd like you to stay on a few days, if you don't mind. I'll have Maggie set up the guest room. Your mother was just about your age when that was taken. I too often forget how beautiful she was. Yes, she was. We all miss her. I want us to make a new beginning. That's exactly what I want, father. Father won't believe someone broke in. You'll only make things worse. Shut your mouth, Emma. Good afternoon. How much for all of it? Thank you, Emma. Lizzie. Is your Maggie at home? I'm sure she's here somewhere. I'm right here, sir. - Were you home at the time of the robbery, Miss... - Sullivan - I was hanging shades - She wouldn't steal from us. Didn't hear anything, then? No strange noises? Didn't see anyone fleeing the scene? No. Not that I recall, sir. Not to be indelicate, Miss Sullivan, but would you mind if we took a look around your room? That won't be necessary. What do you mean, &quot;that won't be necessary&quot;? Might I speak to you in private, Deputy Fleet? The owner of Pawn &amp; Thrift paid a visit to my office. We will not be victimized by fear. No. No! No! Stop it! Ah! Damn it! No! Damn it! Eat, Lizzie. I said you will eat. She doesn't have to eat if she's not hungry, Andrew. Yes, maybe your wife would like mine. She looks hungry. Uncle John looks hungry too. There's more than enough to go around, isn't there, father? You think you're just gonna ship us off? Throw the old maids out like scraps? Give it all to the pervert and the old cow, it that it? You will not speak to me like this. You will apologize to your mother and your uncle John. Don't you dare call her my mother. Apologize. You're a coward, father. A coward and a liar! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I will not be treated this way, Lizzie! Open the door! Lizzie! Lizzie, stop this! Lizzie! Oh, Lizzie. They will take you away now. Don't you know that? Maggie, draw her a bath. Did I... You had a spell. You're all right. Let me help you. Is it ruined? We can save it. It's nothing. You must be freezing. I cannot discuss this with you, Lizzie. Decisions are being made on my behalf. I have a right to know if my inheritance has been abused or squandered, don't I? What else has been done? You must know that's confidential. Perhaps it's something you should raise directly with your father. You're the family attorney. Am I not a member of the family? I know nothing of your father's intentions, and even if I chose to break his confidence, which I cannot, We keep no copies in the office. You father would never allow it. Mr. Jennings, speak plainly. Is John Morse to be the custodian of my inheritance? I'm sure your uncle has only the family's best interest at heart. My uncle is nothing but a failed horse trader. - Lizzie... - He is a liar and a fraud. My father only keeps his counsel out of some adolescent need for male companionship. He is unfit, Mr. Jennings. You know this, yet you do not contradict my father. You allow him to destroy us all on a whim? Do you feel no responsibility to me or to my sister? Got a letter. I can read some of it. Just... Just read it. Attempts were made to contact you on several occasions, but unfortunately, we've just now located your current address. I regret to inform you that your mother, Mary Catherine Sullivan, has passed on after a long illness. I'm sorry, Bridget. Awful to hear of your mother's passing, Maggie. Thank you, sir. It's... It's been quite... Mr. Borden. It's all right now, Maggie. It's all right, sweet girl. Shh, Maggie. Do what I say now, Maggie. Ah! You think if I leave... he'd give me a reference? Find me a new position? Is that what you think? Understand the weight that your father's name carries. Understand it. - I do understand. - You don't. Would you prefer I starve? You think I choose to be here? Lizzie. Things come out worse than I mean. A lot. No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry this is happening to you. I'm ashamed to be his daughter. I've been lying to myself for so long now. Telling myself... that things will get better. But it won't, will it? Not ever. Why are you kind to me? Lizzie? I'm here, Emma. Look at the handwriting. It matches a contract I found in father's office. We can't be certain. I saw him, Emma. How could father not see it? He would never believe it. He's blinded by their partnership. Uncle John is playing on father's fear. He's manipulating father into signing over our inheritance, Emma. Well, whatever you do, don't provoke John. He's not like the rest of us. You're wrong. He's desperate. He has no place left to go. He's exactly like us. Out on the town? Never picked you for a night bird. You really expected to get away with this? Well? You don't even have enough courage to admit it to my face. Do you? Oh, don't play games, Lizzie. I thought we could discuss this matter candidly, but perhaps I was wrong. Discuss what, exactly? These letters are written in your hand. I don't think anyone would dispute that. I'm not gonna warn you more than once. I'm not my father. -You can't scare me into needing you. -No. Oh. You think pretty highly of yourself, don't you? Yeah? Listen to me. You're just another girl, past ripe, who thinks that she's... too special for this world. Nobody understands what's in your heart, is that it? Well, I understand you, Lizzie. I understand you. You're nothing to no one. You never were, never will be. It's you that doesn't know me. You hear? And that's how you wanna keep it. I promise you. Lizzie. All this exertion has made me a little thirsty. Good night, ladies. I'm fine, Bridget. Don't worry about Mr. Morse. He left this morning. Early. First light. Not even a word to your father. I appreciate what you did. I didn't do anything. Don't make me leave this room. No. You're home early. I, uh... thought I'd have lunch with you today. Where's Maggie? Her afternoons are her own. Maggie? Do you have a shirt in urgent need of mending? Or some silver you'd like polished? I am... continually astonished at the endless number of ways you find to humiliate yourself in this family. Nothing but an Irish whore, aren't ya? Say it. Say it! I'm an Irish whore. I don't want you spending time with Maggie. What? I don't you tutoring Maggie, I don't want you going on outings with Maggie, I don't you speaking to Maggie on any terms but those appropriate to Lady and housemaid. Am I clear? Bridget is my friend. No, you are mistaken. She's your servant. In any case, it makes no difference. I'll be giving Maggie her notice come September. On what grounds? I need no grounds. This attachment you've formed is unhealthy, and it must end. Please don't force me to put it any more bluntly than that. Say it. Say exactly what you mean. I wanna hear you say it. You're an abomination, Lizzie. And at last, we are on equal footing, father. He won't forgive you. Not now. You watch how you speak to me. Why? It won't be long before he sends you away. I'm afraid. I won't let anyone hurt you. You can't promise that. I will promise it. I will make good on it. Do you believe me? If you need my help, you have it. You must be certain if you say that. No matter what the cost. I am. Bridget? Bridget, come quick! Somebody's killed father! Go for the police! Now! Bridget, go! To your knowledge, did your father have any enemies? Shall I repeat the question? No, I heard you. Please answer. This is America, sir. Every man with a pulse has enemies. Of course, there's a will. I've seen it. Well, it's certainly not in father's office or this house. Have you contacted the attorney? Andrew Jennings is father's attorney, and he knows nothing of a will. There must be another attorney. An estate attorney. Well, I find that hard to imagine. You knew father. Probably thought he'd live forever. I suppose that's a mistake we all make now, isn't it. We have young Miss Borden at the house during the murder event. We have the murder weapon. You have a hatchet. That is as much as can be said. We have a hatchet encrusted with blood and hair. And we have motive. There's no motive. On the contrary. As a result of this suddenly untraceable will, you and your sister stand to inherit one of the largest fortunes in New England. That is a vile insinuation. Emma, if... Lizzie pleads guilty to a lesser charge, A lesser charge? What would that mean? It's up for discussion. Manslaughter? Involuntary manslaughter, perhaps? And what of Maggie? Hmm? She was here the whole time. Is she accused of no crime? Several witnesses can place Maggie outside washing windows at the time of your step-mother's murder. And your uncle has an alibi. Your sister's whereabouts are less clear. But my sister is innocent. There are no guarantees here, of course, but she's a woman, she's from good home, and the judge may very well be sympathetic. She will not plead guilty. Then, she will hang. Bridget, look at me. Lizzie. It's time. Lizzie Andrew Borden, out of deference to your family, and your long history in this community, I have ordered that these proceedings shall remain closed to the public at large. I would ask that both the prosecution and the defense refrain from discussing any details from the case as it moves forward. Professor Wood, you hold the chair of chemistry at Harvard University, do you not? Yes, I do. And... You... examined the hatchet in question, did you not? Yes, I did. The police inspectors felt there were suspicious stains and what appeared to be human hair on the hatchet. And what did you find? All blood and hair samples on the hatchet in question were found to be animal in origin. Specifically, bird. Thank you, Professor Wood. Fucking bitches. Your service here has not been terminated, Maggie. I think it's best if I find a new position. Simply won't allow it. And under the circumstances, neither will the court. If anyone needs me, they can find me at the Douglas. - Excuse me... - Make no mistake. If you let my sister hang for this, I will haunt you for the rest of your days. I wish you the best of luck. Excuse me. You must not be completely broke yet, then. I was a little surprised not to see my name on the visitor's list, but reason always prevails. I know a little something about Massachusetts' estate law, you know? Abby Borden died 90 minutes before your father. That's a pretty long time, isn't it? That's time enough to be sure. Sure of what? If the husband dies before the wife, the wife's family inherits. See, if your father died before Abby, you get nothing. Abby's family inherits it all. But, if... Abby dies, and then, Andrew, you inherit it all. So, the madman who committed these crimes had my best interest at heart, is that your point? You think your Maggie's gonna even last out the week? I don't get what's mine? Don't you even think of misjudging me, you cunt. No, John. I believe it's you who's misjudged me. I'm going to find that will. And you're gonna get nothing. But I already have it all. And money can buy many things, John. As you know, a hungry man is capable of anything. I'm not scared of you. Oh, but you are. I can see it. I can feel it. You'll never be safe. Not for one day. You're not even safe here, now, in this room. If I were you, I'd leave Fall River, John. I'd leave tonight, and never look back. - You whore. - Hey! It's all right, let him be. Old men and liquor rarely mix well. Please place your right hand on the Bible before you. Do you swear before Almighty God and all witnesses gathered here to tell the truth in all matters pertaining to the murder of Andrew and Abby Borden? I do. Mr. Jennings. Miss Sullivan. The police have established the time of death for Abby Borden to be approximately 9:30 a.m., and the time of death for Andrew Borden to be approximately 11 a.m. Where were you at these times? Outside. Washing windows. And when did you come in to take your rest? After 11. Just as I finished. And between nine o'clock, and eleven o'clock, Where was Miss Borden? Um... Miss Emma was visiting friends. And Miss Lizzie? She was outside. All morning? All morning. It was very hot, if you remember. She was in the barn for a while. After that, she was sat under a pear tree. Thank you, Miss Sullivan. Nothing further, Your Honor. Mr. Moody. Miss Sullivan. You absolutely certain that Miss Borden never left your sight? I am certain, yes. Were you not concentrated on your work? I suppose so. Then, how would you be absolutely certain that Miss Borden was there the whole time? It's window washing, sir Meaning? It might be hard for someone like yourself to concentrate on the job. But for me, scrubbing a pane of glass is as easy as taking another breath. I would've noticed. She never left your sight? Even after you let Mr. Borden into the house? I saw her then, just as I see her now. Yes. Five minutes, Lizzie. That's all. Are you cold? I'm not. What was I to you? How can you ask that? I don't know you. I don't know who you are. Were you better off before? Is that it? Is that what you think? What is it you want? I want us to try. You're dreaming. You're just dreaming. You don't see it. You can't see it. See what? We live in this world, and not another. This one right here. I know. Bring this to Mrs. Borden at exactly 9 a.m. Tell her it came from the Churchill's. This just came for you, miss. Oh, no. I must get changed. Mrs. Churchill is ill. - Oh, God, no! - Ah! I won't be kept waiting outside my own house. Now, open the door! God dammit. Any mail for me today, father? No, not today. Would you like some soda water? Kind of you. I'm going outside to pick some pears. Would you like one? I would not. Mr. Borden. Maggie. Mmm, ha! - Maggie. Put the hatchet down. - No. Give me the hatchet. God dammit, Maggie, give me the hatchet. She's having some kind of attack. Lizzie. Bridget, go lie down, now. I'm sorry. Bridget! Bridget, come quick! Somebody's killed father! Go for the police! Now! Bridget, go! Just promise me something. Don't write to me. And don't look for me. No. I never wanted anything from you.
