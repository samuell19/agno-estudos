Show me your papers! - Mom? - Rojda! - Rojda my darling! - Thank God you have arrived safely. When did you arrive? I'm so glad you're here. - Where's Dilan? - I don't know. - She didn't want to come. - She isn't here? No. She only brought me to the boat in Izmir. But I sent you so much money! - She said I have to go alone. - Why? You know your sister. I tried to talk to her. You know how stubborn she is. There's been no talking to her since they attacked our village. This is from her. It's for you. You both had worn the same veil. First you left, then her. - No. - I just can't do it anymore. Everything is okay Mom. Look... Look! They are worse than Daesh. They take the children's milk and keep pushing people! Sorry, there is a line. You have to go back. - You have to go back! - Let them be. Come here. - Can you please go back... - What's going on? - They don't stand in the line. - Okay, Jeanne D'Arc. Come on. You, you, you, step back. Come on. Step back. Women and children first. Sorry... Rojda, come back! Rojda! Please let them be. - Excuse me! I have a question. - Yes, but I have no answers. I put my mother's papers. Did they invite you to come in? - Yes, sir, my name is Rojda Xani. - And... I need you to set up my mother's papers. Her name is Ferhat Xani. Every one need papers here. You like to apply for asylum? - No. - No? - No, I already live in Germany. - Then why are you here? I am here, because of my mother. Wait. I'm a German citizen. You understand? Okay, German citizen. - It's a good forgery. You're 26, right? - Yes. - Not married? - No. - No children? - No. Sounds to me like a classical refugee. I am not a refugee. I'm a German citizen. Okay, yes, I understand. Costa... - German citizen? - Yes. Then I am the nephew of Onassis. What's going on? Why don't you believe me? Just do your job already and check my passport. So, okay. Tell me your story. - What story? - How did you get to Germany? It's unbelievable. I was a kid when my family and I moved to Germany. Eventually my parents went back to Iraq and I stayed. - You stayed? - Yes. How old were you? Fourteen? And you want me to believe that your parents left you in Germany all by yourself? I wasn't alone. I stayed with my auntie and my uncle. Quite unusual, because I know about Iraq/Germany but Germany/Iraq? I don't know. You think I'm lying? Perhaps. I don't know. Supposed your passport is correct, the problem with your mother still remains. Give me two hours. I'll see what I can do. Sisters Apart - Taxi! - Hello, where to? - To the airport, please. - Can we really go? Yes, Mom, I took care of everything. Goodbye. Goodbye, and take care. Take us with you. No, no. Just kidding. Go ahead. Come in. - Can we stay here? - Yes, this is my apartment. Feeling better? I lost my house and garden. I don't know what happened to my child. Yeah, I'm just great. Do you live alone here? - Yes. - Good. - That's good. - Here you go. Thank you. - What kind of coffee is this? - That's Greek coffee. - I thought they only drink cold coffee. - No, they make it hot too. It's the same coffee, Mom. It's not the same. It's not the same. Morning. Groups of three, keep your distance! Xani, catch up! Let's go! So your sister is fighting alongside the women in Iraq? - Appears so. - Man, this is hard. If only our women would fight against men like they do... You really can't compare the two. So what are you going to do? - Will you go down there and get her? - Come on! That will be 24.90 Euro. - Thank you. - Thanks. Look who it is! Our neighbors from back home. - It's been so long. - How long have you been here? For over a year. Many of our friends and relatives moved here. The others I know are from our country too. We will bring your sister here too. Rojda, from now on we're here for you. No matter what, come and shop here. Rojda, welcome. Why do you never come and visit us? Are you well? Don't worry about your sister, okay? Come to us if you need anything. We have lawyers, interpreters and other ways to help. - Thank you. - Wait a minute, I'll be right back. I am back. Take this, fill it out and bring it to the government office tomorrow. It's an application for asylum. But I want 50 Euro for it. Let's make it 20. We don't know where she is at the moment. - Leave her alone. - I only gave her the papers. - Leave her be. - Okay, okay. Come, Mom. - I wanted to stay longer, but alright. - Goodbye. I'm sure we'll see each other soon. Who is he selling those application forms to? I think he helps the new arrivals. They don't know where to start. Well, they are actually for free. - Free? Without paying? - Yes. This is Dilan's number! Dilan, finally! How are you? What do you mean by "your sisters"? Dilan, we're worried sick about you. - Pack your things immediately and... - Hand me the phone. Hello? Hello Dilan, sweetheart. How are you doing? Dilan, where are you? Why can't you talk? Sweetheart, come here. You need to know that I love you so much! Come back to us. Dilan, my darling. Hello? The call was disconnected. My dear child. What can I do for you? My sweetheart... - I'll do it. - Leave it. Leave it! I'll do it myself. All this is no problem for you. You're living your life here. Don't you care about her being there? It's dangerous. - I'm getting her out of there either way. - And how? Doesn't matter, I'll do it. And stop speaking to me in German. Give it to me. - Let go. - I'll do it myself. - Dilan? - No, it's me. My darling. I thought you were Dilan. I'm sorry. Go back to sleep. Faster! Keep to the right. ...two, one and hold. I have a question. We still provide training in Erbil, right? That's where the Peshmerga get their training. Yeah, so? Is there... some kind of name index? If you're looking for someone? Why? Who are you looking for? My sister. Your sister? Do you understand what you're saying? Do you know what can happen if you bring your private life here? You'll be out of here. Along with anyone who helps you. I take over. Shake out your arms. Number five! - Number five!... Five! - There is nothing on five. What? There's no Kurdish channel? Wait, wait! Try the top button. I can't find anything. - Rojda, good thing you're here. - Don't you have any Kurdish channels? - Which one? - The one that shows the news. - World News. - Why do you need a Kurdish channel? This is what I've got and they show the news too. - The ones that show the news. - Kurdistan TV, Newrot, Kurdsat... How do you watch the news? The Kurdish channels list every death, who needs that? Look, this is all I have. - Okay? - What's this?! - You don't need anything else. - What a shame. We're leaving. But why? Don't worry. If there's anything you need, come and see us. I'm sorry. Bye. Bye. - Here, you forgot your glasses. - Here, you forgot this. Sorry again. Bye! Was that necessary? How does that make me look in front of my ladies? Our people are fighting and dying and you don't care? I do. But I don't need to watch TV every day for that. Do you know why they watch TV every day? Because we feel for our people. That's who we are. We are all brothers and sisters. Why are you so opposed to our struggle? They're not going to give you the land, Mom. You should have understood that by now. If I thought like that, I would have killed myself already! At least they're fighting for what's right. You alright? I'm fine. I want to sign up for Erbil. Okay. That's your business. Got it. What do you need? A letter of recommendation. - From me? - Yes. What should I write? That you won't be a risk factor because you have no family there? No, I speak Kurdish. Can't you recommend me as an interpreter? Sure, but that's where the mountain troops are. They like to stay amongst themselves. Just asking. Listen, I have a buddy I was in Afghanistan with. I'll talk to him. Thanks. One more. How did you do that? Look, Mom. You press "Source", then "OK". Does it stay like that? Look at that. Just look at what's happening to them. Women and children are forced to flee. Look, all the houses are destroyed. My poor Kurdistan. My poor country. - Xani? - Yes. - Do you know the Xanis near Duhok? - That's my uncle's family. Stay here! We need German trained female soldiers. But I'm a German soldier. Many people return from the diaspora to fight. You wouldn't be the first. To Camp Erable? Wait a moment, guys. We are waiting for a German soldier here. That's me. What? You don't look like a German soldier. You think so? How does a German soldier look like? Hello. IDs please. Stephan, is okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good luck. Bella! Hey! What a day... So hot... - First time here? - Yes. - Rojda Xani. Hi! - Hello. Rojda... Xani. Thank you. You are in staff sergeant Breitmeier's unit. He's right over there. Go ahead and introduce yourself. - Which one is it? - The one in the red T-shirt. - This isn't ballet class! Hustle! - Got it. See you later! - Passport, please. - Hi. Let's go! Attack, attack! Easy does it... Shoot! Yes! You have to close the gap back there, Thomas. - What? I was there! - What do you mean, what? Nice pass, nice pass. Staff sergeant. - Take a break, guys. - Break? - We're still playing! - Just a minute. - Fuck, man! - Enough. What's up? Sergeant Rojda Xani, 1st signal battalion, reporting for duty. The Kurdish woman from Tom's unit! Great. It's Sergeant. I'm here to assist you in training the Kurdish women. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to insult you. Come. Tom said you'd be a good fit and I need someone who understands the women. I mean, I understand women. I meant the ones fighting here. They fight differently. But if I'm to train them, I have to find the right approach. You coming or what? But you'll see all that tomorrow. For now, make yourself comfortable in our five star hotel. Okay. - Better yet, join us for a game! - No thank you, Staff Sergeant. Hey, team building! What's up? - You gonna play? - Let's go. - Who's that? - That's our new teammate. - That's the Kurd? - Yes. Has she been screened? Yeah, she just showed me her family tree. Shoot! Yes! 15 more minutes! Do you want to get to Mosul via Til Kaif? Yes. Then through Al Qamar until we near the Syrian border. - I would take that route. - Not bad either. - Sleep in? - I'm sorry, Staff Sergeant... You can forget the "Staff Sergeant". I'm Alex. That's Icke our driver. - Hi. - That's Fuhrmann. His name's actually Mark, but we have too many Marks here. - Rojda. - Rojda? I thought it was Rosa. - You can call me Rosa too. - Okay, Rosa. This is our route. Could get bumpy. I thought we train them in their camps? Normally we do. But today's about behavioural patterns and terrains. - Let's go, move out! - I'll just throw this out. Stop! Not in that one. Waste separation. - Here? - German Waste Regulations. Doesn't matter that the Iraqis burn it all in the end. - Sure thing. Is that your dog? - No. Bravo Team, can you hear me? - Weasel 3, I can hear you. - Got it. - See you soon, darlings. - Got it. Report when you arrive. - Where are we? - ISIS was still here three weeks ago. We'll be training the women today. We tried several times, but we never got far. It's good that you're here. Hey, come here! What's your name? - Alex, Rojda. - What's your name? Jenna. My name is Rojda. - What's your name? - Bilal. Here you go. Ready? Fuhrmann. Weasel 1 to Weasel 3, come in. We're on a mission. - Okay, we're on our way. - Report on arrival. Over. Have a nice day. Over and out. - Are there only women up there? - No. But we're training the men as medics in Erbil. - Hey. - Hey, welcome. - Yes. My name is Rojda. - I'm Berivan. Welcome. Come with me. Thanks. - 20 kilometers from Shingal. - What? 40 km? - 20. - I understood 40. Everyone speaks different languages here. Some of them only speak Arabic. Get up and come here, friends. Here we go again. You don't understand? We don't have a leader. Rojda, could you come here please? Why don't they have a leader? He wants to know who your leader is. - We don't want one. - We don't need a leader. We don't want to have a leader. - Slower, slower! - What did she say? - And who gives the orders? - We are all one. Sometimes she gives orders, sometimes I do. - But how? - What is she saying, Rojda? That's just how it is. Sometimes her, sometimes me. Please explain to her that there will be chaos without a leader and they won't win a fight. We don't need one. We can manage without. He doesn't understand. Slowly, slowly. Ok, ok. Everyone introduce yourselves one by one. Okay, say your names. What's your name? Gigdem Ali Mohammed. - Avin Hajiahmedi. - Berfin Sleman. - Navdil Abdulqadir. - Rozerin Faqe Ash. Shirin Yosif. We won't let the Germans lead us. We are all one. We remove the hearing protection from the packaging, reach over our heads to our left ear with our right hand, form the hearing protection into a cone shape with our left hand and place it in the ear canal. We all know where our ears are. Tell us where our arms are. - What exactly is she trying to tell us. - What did she say? She said it's nice that the Germans are worried about our ears but they want to improve their shooting, not their hearing. We have to protect our ears. If we can't hear, we can't hear the enemy. They don't want to become professionals, they want to fight as long as necessary and return to their families. So do I. It is my mission to train them well enough so they can return. Explain that to them. Ok, here we go. Take this and put it here. Where are your ears? Look, this is how you insert it. Right, then left. I will put this in my right ear, and this one for the left. Fire! - Get ready, number two. - Rozerin get ready. - Fire! - Fire! Come here and help me. Take this. - Anything else? - No. Wash your hands. Who needs to wash their hands? That's the only drinking water we have, guys. You can have some, if you want. - Do you want some? - No thanks. I already spent three nights on the toilet. What do we have here? Beef roulade with spaetzle. May I ask you something? Yes. Are girls in Germany allowed to go to school alone? Yes. And sit next to a boy at the cinema? - Yes. - And kiss a boy? Yes. Then I'm moving to Germany. May I ask something too? Yes. Do you know Dilan Xani? No, I don't know any Dilan Xani. Where are you going, Berivan? We'll manage. Hey there, you must be starving. Alright, alright. Alright, come with me. Go on. - I have your stuff. - Thanks, you can give me that. - She did pretty well, didn't she? - Yeah, she did. It won't be long until she's one of them. Well done, Alex! Get up, soldier. Get back here! Hello? Rojda, is that you darling? Hello, Mom? Hello? - Hello? - I don't know! I don't know. Okay, Mom, that's it. I have to go. Hey. - Didn't mean to bother you. - No, no problem. I was talking to my mother. Wanted to see if everything's okay. Okay. We could use a 5th player. But I don't want to ask the two guys from the medic troops. They get rowdy. Wanna play? - I can't play soccer right now. - Sure you can. Didn't I just save you from your mother? You owe me. - Pass the ball! - Have you completely lost it? - Nice one! - You think I'm here to play soccer? Let's see your dribbling. Weasel 3, report your locations. We're on our way to the training area. - Have fun vacuuming. - Enjoy your day, you lazy bastards. The target is the house down this street. You all go together. But you have to be careful with every path you cross. Watch your step! The area is secure, but you never know. Come. Don't be scared. It's just training. Get out quickly. - Attention! - They killed them all! What did she say? Okay, keep moving. Search for cover and secure position. Bravo! What is this? Get out of there. Quickly, quickly. Get out of there, Rojda! Mom, Mom! - Where's my mother... - Get the girl out of here. Get out Rojda. Get out! We had to secure a junction in Mazar-i-Sharif once. Someone had blown himself up there with a car bomb. He took over 30 people with him. The whole street was bone dry. Around the bomb crater, it looked like it had rained. I didn't know if it was water or gasoline. It took me forever to comprehend that it was blood. Now, every time the first rain drops hit the sand, I wonder for a second if it's blood. Then I realize that it must be rain. I'm sorry to hear that. Don't be. I can't tell you how excited I get about rain now. Tell her we'll be suspending drills for the time being. Okay, we will be suspending the drills. Alright. What will become of them? - Will they stay here? - Of course. Where else should they go? Did you think it was your sister's shawl? - Give it to me! - No! - Calm down! - He's playing with my letter! Leave us alone for a minute. Okay, calm down. Look at me. What letter? A letter from my Mom for me and my sister. Calm down, what happened? It's my letter. I want him to give my letter back. - What letter? - My letter. Come, let's look for it. Unfortunately, we haven't seen any letter here. I'm not leaving without my letter. My dear daughter... I want to tell you, you should know... how much your mother loves you. You were six years old when the war began. You were special to me. You were a gift from God. And then there was this beautiful day when your sister was born. You were everything to me. With you my life truly began. Don't forget that you have a sister. Look out for her, as she will look out for you. Whatever happens, sisters will never be separated. I send you all my love, my girl with black eyes. - We have to go, it's getting late. - Yeah, I know. Give her a couple more minutes. She'll be back soon. Sergeant major's order was to be back at 10pm, which we won't make. - I'm going in there and getting her. - Hey, Fuhrmann. I'll do it. Hello. Rojda here? Can you get her? Berivan, this German soldier wants to see Rojda. It was very hard for her. I think it's better she stays here. But that's not allowed, and it doesn't change what happened. Berivan, can we stay here? What did she say, Rojda? She wants us to stay here tonight and watch her. - Impossible. Come, we have to go. - No. I can't leave now. - We have orders. - I don't care, I can't go. - But I do care. You're not safe here. - Yes I am. And I'm staying here tonight. Let's go play. We're are sleeping outside. - Weasel 1, this is weasel 3. - Weasel 1 here. Requesting permission to stay overnight in Camp P due to possible hostile activity. What hostile activity? We're staying. Call it a trust-building exercise. - Permission granted. - Understood, out. Are you serious? Come on, it's just like old times. Or have you forgotten how to sleep on the ground? Rojda? What are you doing here? I'm looking for a glass. The little one just fell asleep. I have a daughter too. You have a daughter? I wrapped her in a cloth too. She was nine months old. I was on a bus. We were stopped by IS fighters and had to get out. They examined me and forced me to give blood for them. Then they made me get back in the bus. When I got out again, my daughter was gone. I looked for her, but couldn't find her. I screamed and cried. They forced me to get back on the bus. To this day I don't know where she is. When was this? Three years ago. You know where my sister is. Who's there? Hello, my name is Berivan. We're from the base on the other side and came to meet... Okay, I know. Please come in. - Let her inside. - Rojda come here. Thank you. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Good evening. Dilan, there's a Rojda here looking for you. Good evening. This is my sister Rojda. Are you cold? No, I'm not cold. It's cold. Rojda, why are you here? You can't stay here. Come with me. Please. Stop it, Rojda. You were allowed to stay back then. And I had to return to Iraq. I didn't have a choice. This is my family now. If I lose my home, I will have nothing. I don't know if you can understand that. I understand you, but what about Mom and me? Don't you wish that it could be like it used to be... Please. Rojda? We have to get back. - She will come with us. - Our time is up, we have to go back. She's coming with us, Berivan. Dilan? Dilan, where are you? Get away from there! They're shooting from there! We can take cover at the house. Stay close behind me. Berivan, wait! We lost Dilan! Dilan! This way! Are you hurt? Berivan, wait! Dilan! Go over there. Rojda! Rojda! Come back right now! Dilan! No, no! Dilan! Look at me! Hello! It's me! Berivan, help me! Dilan! Look at me! Oh God... It doesn't look that bad! I'm sorry, I should have stayed with you. Stay with me, okay? Look at me, I'm right here with you. Please stay with me. Please. Look at me. No... Berivan! Come help me! Do you remember the time... I saw a spider and I was so scared. I fell over and you laughed at me. Remember? Please stay with me. Shit. Oh God. God! I've got you. I won't let you go. I've got you. I've got you. I'm staying here with you. Rojda? Rojda? Do you want some tea? - Yes please. Give me a cup of tea. Put some sugar in it, please. Well done, thank you. You brought this as well? Thanks, well done. Did you pour the tea? Where should I put it? My sweetheart, welcome back. Welcome back. My darling Rojda. Come. I'll give you some sweets to eat. Give Rojda some sweets. - Come in, Rojda, come in! - Eat some sweets. It's feast day. Dilan. Shit. She's a cutie, right? - Hello, Rojda. - Hi. Gotta go. Could you hold this? Wait, Rojda. Had I known you were looking for your sister... What then? You couldn't have done anything. She made her choice. I wasn't talking about her. Never mind. I have to go. Heading to Mazar-i-Sharif tomorrow. Take care. Alex? Thank you. - Good morning Mom. - Good morning. What are you looking for? I need a coffee. The coffee is here. - No, I want some mocha. - Here, mocha is here. - Here. - Very well. - Are you okay? - Yes. - Do you want some too? - No, thank you. What would I do without you? Revised and Synchronized by FAST TITLES MEDIA
