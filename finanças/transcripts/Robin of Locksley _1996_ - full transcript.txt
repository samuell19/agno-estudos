Hey, 'morning, Rob. Hey. Good morning, Alan. Hey! Whoa! ( Knocking on door ) Woman: Robbie, honey, you've got to leave for school in 20 minutes. Are you dressed yet? Yeah, mom. How does your tie look? Fine, mom. Testing, testing, 1-2-3. This is just a test. ( Beep ) ( Mechanism whirrs ) Testing, testing, 1-2-3. ( Voice deepens ) This is just a test. ( Telephone dialing ) ( Telephone ringing ) Hello? Hello, is... ( Deepened voice ) James brandenburg there, please? Speaking. James. This is detective sergeant Nelson from the Kansas City police department. Vice squad. Huh? Well, it has been reported that on the night of August the 26th, you were in violation of section 5672 of the penal code, which clearly states that, as a minor, you're not allowed to perform the disgusting deeds you are alleged to have committed with that chicken. ( Click, beep ) ( Normal voice ) James, you there? Nice voice, Rob. How'd you do it? Voice synthesizer. I just got it. Shut up! Man, I wish my parents could win the lottery. You wanna trade? Sure. I could get used to being rich. Cool. I'll fly back to Kansas City and hang, and you can come out here and go to a snob school while your parents jet out to Brussels. What are they doing, buying sprout? It's a horse auction, retard. Honey, hurry up! And who are you talking to? And I thought you said your tie was tied. No, I didn't, and i'm talking to Jimmy, so... Hello, Jimmy, Robin will call you as soon as he gets home from school. Mom! Oh, baby! I'm sorry I can't take you to school on your first day. A new school. ( Chuckles ) But in order to get the concorde, we had to take this early flight. You gonna pick me up one of those French bows I was talking about? Don't you think you have enough bows? Don't you think you have enough horses? Hey, Rob, good knot. Feels like I'm gonna choke. Well... I think you look very... handsome. Oh, Robbie, this is a wonderful opportunity for you, going to this school. Locksley academy is the best. Come on, hon, we gotta go. Uh, honey, are you gonna wear that hat? Are you gonna wear that hat? Oh. Bye-bye, Robin. Bye-bye! Oh, we love you! Call you when we get there. Rosie: You two have a nice flight. Come on, Janet, get in the car. 'Bye, Rosie. Come on, Janet, get in the car. 'Bye, Rosie. Whoa! Easy, scout! Hey! Sorry! Let me guess. You're Robin? Yeah. Who are you? Marian. My dad's the wrangler here. He told me you finally showed up. How was computer camp? ( Muttering ) I dunno. You like to ride? I don't know. Never tried it. You like archery? Not when I'm the target. Well, I wasn't aiming for you, I was aiming for the whirligig things. Right. Rosie: Robin! Time for school! Um, listen, I gotta go, but I'll see you later? Not if I see you first. Hey! My arrow! "Give us a boy, and we will give you back a man." Gimme a break, or I'll give you back the uniform. So they take themselves a little seriously. It's a good school, Robin. Yeah, well, so is my school back home. At least I had friends there. Well, Seattle is your home now, honey. I know, Rosie, but look at this place. I mean, this isn't me. No! You are you. You're the same Robin McAllister that you were back in Kansas. So? Just be yourself, and then it doesn't matter where you are. Thanks, Rosie. Have a good day. Way to go, kid. Sorry. What'd you do, run to school? I had to. Papa's car broke down and I didn't know which bus to take. This is my first day. Mine to. Rob McAllister. Tommy Tyler. How you doin'? Are you here on a scholarship? Well, not exactly. Well, I am. That's why I can't be late. Man on P.A.: All new students should report to their home rooms. Room assignments are posted on the... ( Continues indistinctly ) Cut it out! Not until you pay the tax, fat boy. What tax? Ugly tax. The uglier you are, the more you gotta pay. Your daddy better give you a big allowance, 'cause you're beyond ugly, fat boy! ( Groaning ) How you doing? What's going on? ( Chuckles ) Let me guess-- you're new. ...fat boy! Shouldn't we--? Never fear. Will Scarlet's here. Unh! ( Groaning ) Yuck! Warner! Gibson! Sic! Ha ha ha! Oww! This would be an excellent time to leave! Let's get 'em! Get out of the way! Gentlemen, if you please...! Mr. Little! What is going on here? Speak? Good morning, Mr. Harvey, sir. These three young gentlemen just attacked us out of nowhere, sir. What? We don't even know why, Mr. Harvey, sir. Silence. Young man... I want you, you, and you to wait for me in my office. What for? Now! Now! Off to your classes. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Harvey. If it's not too much trouble. So, what's your name, anyway? Robin McAllister. Will Scarlet. My friend here, who they were using as a wrestling mat, is John little, but everybody calls him little John. Yeah, well, they might as well call me dead. My mother's gonna kill me when she finds out about this. That's not fair. Those other three were the ones trying to take your money. He's new. Those three dirt bags just happen to be the richest kids in school. I thought everyone here was rich. Well, there are a few scholarship kids, then there's rich, then there's filthy rich. That guy that was using little John's stomach as a trampoline... Man, don't remind me. ...that's John prince. His old man-- John, sr.-- Is paying for the new gym. Yeah. The prince gymnasium. You think Mr. Harvey's gonna blow that off by coming down on his son? The same with those other two guys, Warner and Gibson. Their dads sprung for the new science wing. Man, they can do whatever they want. It's not fair. Of course, Mr. Prince. And you tell the basketball coach that if he wants a bigger office, he can build his own gym. I'm sinking enough money into this place as it is. Yes, sir, Mr. Prince, and we certainly appreciate your generosity. You should. Thanks for stopping by. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Prince here. What? Always a... Yeah, yeah, yeah. ...a pleasure. So... who's first? Look out! ( Indistinct shouts ) Hey, are you all right? I was until you came along. Sorry. I didn't see you. Come on. Where's scout? I mean... Sir Richard of the lion heart. Who? The horse. His name is scout, but your mother decided to change it to sir Richard of the lion heart. Yeah, well maybe it wasn't an awesome enough name. Great. Now he's probably gone running back to his stable, and my dad's got a buyer coming to look at him. Well, get on, I'll give you a ride. You expect me to ride with you? Well, why not? Well, every time I've seen you, I've almost been killed. Okay. Suit yourself. Robin. Yeah? Can I have a ride? Okay, but you're gonna have to say please. Don't push your luck, Robin. All right, hang on. ( Marion laughing ) Beauty, isn't he? The boss is away in Europe, buying some new stock. That's the only reason they're even thinking of selling him. Look him over. I'll be right back. Thought I told you to loosen him up, not turn him loose. I had an... an accident. It was my fault. No, it was both our faults. Are you all right? Well, you both need to be more careful. These horses are your parent's business now, and it's my business to look after them. Understood? Yes, dad. My son would like to take him for a test ride. Oh, he's a spirited animal, sir. Oh, I'm sure John, Jr., can handle him, can't you, son? What are you doing here? My parents own this ranch, and scout here is not for sale. Scout? I thought his name was sir Richard of the lion heart. It is. Go ahead. Mount him up if you'd like. Yeah, hurry up, son. I've got a plane to catch. Uh... that's all right. What? You don't want the horse? No, I just don't feel like riding right now. ( Chuckles ) What a geek! You're telling me. How much did you say they were asking for this horse? $20,000, and worth every penny. What? Because they gave him some fancy name? I'll offer you 10,000. Sorry, but you'll have to talk to the boss about that. Well, looks like you're wasting my time. You tell them when they're serious about selling, they can contact me at the prince American corporation in Chicago. Come on, son. ( Whinnies ) Robin, move it! We're going to be late-- where's your uniform?! ( Doorbell rings ) Relax, Rosie, it's free-dress day. It means we can wear whatever we want. 'Morning. Yes! My new recurve! What's that? A bow! Well, come on, let's go! Man on P.A.: Any students interested in joining the... ( Continues indistinctly ) Well, here we are, boys. What's all this? This is extracurricular stuff. That's the soccer club. My dad played soccer, so of course I've got to play. That's the trump club. They're really weird about bridge. Cards and stuff, right? Cool. That's the computer club. ( Blows raspberry ) That's the checkmate club. All they do is play chess. ( Giggles ) What's the bull's-eye club? Naw, man! Archery! Come on, man! That's prince's private club! Robin McAllister. I'd like to sign up, please. You know how to handle a bow and arrow? I get by. You "get by"? Yeah. ( Dry chuckle ) Get lost. Well, can't I at least try out? Well... that depends. Where'd you learn to shoot? I taught myself. I used to go down to the range behind the public golf course in Kansas City. In Kansas City? Where's Toto? A public golf course? What, didn't they have an archery range at your country club? I didn't belong to a country club. Ah! Scholarship scum! I shoulda guessed. I'm not on a scholarship. Where'd your parents get the money to afford this place? Steal it? They won the lottery. The lottery? Are you kidding me? Hey! Two bucks, and you can get to Locksley. Real exclusive, huh, guys? Hey, hey, hey. Forget it, Robin. You know what? There's a raffle you can enter at the end of the month. Or maybe you should start a bingo club McAllister. Hey, you might even win enough money for a one-way ticket back to Kansas City. ( Chuckles ) You know, those losers probably couldn't hit a 10-ring from 30 feet. So then why do you want to join their stupid club anyways? Because I'm good. ( Indistinct chatter ) ( Enthused shouting ) Ohh! Come on, guys, this is soccer, not football. Let's go. Get off of him. Tommy, you all right? Tommy. You okay, buddy? Yeah, I'm okay. All right. Good placement. Nice grouping. Not bad. What do you want? I want to talk to your coach. We don't have a coach. Don't want a coach. Don't need a coach. Don't you get it? This isn't a school sport, it's a private club. And it's full. You use a release aid? Yeah, that's right. How come? ( Chuckles ) Because, McAllister, it improves your accuracy. In case you hadn't noticed, I just stuck two in the 9-ring. Oh. But I thought this was supposed to be the bull's-eye club. Come on. Let's let lottery boy try. Let's see if he shoots a bow as well as he shoots off his mouth. ( Chuckles ) This bow cost 1,500 bucks. The boy would probably break it. Newscaster: Tragedy struck a local family earlier today when fire gutted their southside home. Reporter: Fire investigators have determined a leaky gas line ignited when 10-year-old Tommy tarla let himself into the family home this afternoon after school. Tommy, the youngest son of Mark and Betty tarla... Tommy? ...who were both at work when the fire started, was injured when he jumped from this second-story window in an attempt to rescue the family dog and to escape the flames... Would you like some dessert, Robin? He's currently listed in stable condition at St. Vincent's hospital. Rosie: Oh, that poor boy! I know him! With me now is father tuck, the parish priest from St. ignacios, the family's church. Father tuck? That's my church! Where will the tarla family stay now that the home has been destroyed? At the rectory until we can find suitable housing. Unfortunately, the tarlas don't have insurance, and Tommy will need surgery. Now, these are good, hard-working people just trying to make a better life for themselves. It really is a tragedy. Thank you, father. A medical fund has been set up at the local bank in Tommy tarla's name. You can contact St. ignacios for further information. I can't believe it. He was so excited about starting school. His poor parents. I'm gonna have to stop by the rectory and see if there's anything I can do for them. Wish there was something i could do. There's always something, Robin. ( Doorbell rings ) ( Robin sighs ) Hi! Hi. Are you busy? Uh... no. Not really. Can I come in? Yeah. Yeah. Come in. It thought you might like this back. Thanks. They just showed this thing on the news today about this kid I met at school. His house, like, blew up when he came home. Is he all right? Well, he's alive, but he had to jump, like, 50 feet to get out. ( Sighs ) He messed himself up pretty bad, and his parents don't have enough money to pay for the hospital, so there's this charity fund. Wow. I get 15 bucks for my allowance. Well, that's not till next week. Wait a second. You're the one whose parents just won the lottery. Yeah, but they spend it pretty quick. You don't get it all at once. Most of it went into this ranch. I get less allowance than you do. Right. Must be tough. ( Telephone rings ) ( Robin sighs ) Hello? Janet: Hi, honey. Um... uh, hi, mom. Where are you? Brussels. Oh, I must say, the concorde was amazing! Couldn't I just go to public school? Locksley happens to be the finest prep school in the country. Just... Give it a chance. So, what have we got here? So... how was your day today? Well, I met this scholarship kid, and it just showed on the news that-- uh, just a minute. The filter! Well, why don't you tell him that, Grant? Honey, your father wants to talk to you. Hi, son! Hi, dad. How are you? Hey, listen, when that pool guy comes around on Friday, you want to have him check out the filter? You know, the machine itself? Yeah, the motor's got a hitch in it. Sure, dad. Look, I was telling mom about this family in town that's house burnt down. Uh-huh. That's too bad, son. Is that someone you know? I met their son in school, and he got hurt really bad, and they have no insurance, so, I was just wondering if we could... Oh, hang on, son! I've got some paperwork to sign! Here's your mom. Oh, thanks. ( Giggles ) Hi, honey, I'm back. Hi, mom. His name's Tommy. Who? The kid who got hurt. There's this medical fund, and I want to help. Oh, that's nice, dear. How's Rosie? Rosie? Uh... Rosie's fine. She goes to the same church as the tarlas. Who? That's their name-- people whose house burnt down. Oh, I see. Well, listen, dear, um, tell Rosie we send our best. All right, I'll tell her. We love you, honey. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. 'Bye. 'Bye. This is some setup. You into computers? Sometimes. So, uh, you one of those computer nerds? Well, let's just say it's one of my unique gifts. Step aside, watch the master work. Okay. What are you doing? Surfing the 'net. The what? The Internet. Us nerds can access information from all over the world-- inside information if you know what you're doing. I know. What? That was today. John prince. His old man's supposed to be the big cheese at one of the top corporations in the country. He sure acted like it. We'll see how big he really is. I can't follow it. Here. Maybe this'll help. Female voice: Good evening. Sound card voice recognition system activated. Forbes 500 top corporations. It talks? It listens too. Now, if I could only get it to do my homework. Computer, find prince, John, sr. Prince, John, sr. Chief executive officer of prince American corporation. Gross sales previous year, five billion U.S. dollars. That's amazing! Five billion dollars. It's disgusting, is what it is. I'm starting to think this isn't such a good idea. Why not? Well, for starters, I don't know a thing about archery. Well, you're pretty good with a slingshot, and, I mean, it's the same principle. Yeah, but a slingshot. You're not afraid of prince and those geeks, are you? No way! Then just do what I say. There's nothing to it. Hold this. Get out of my way, McAllister. Coach has me running laps, and i'm, like, a mile behind already. So why don't you take up a more civilized sport, like archery. What? You mean with prince and his bozos? I-- forget it! Robin and I are forming our own club. Well, I'm real happy for you guys, but i-i really gotta get going. You're joining the club, little. Stop it, okay? Not until you join archery. Stop it! Not until you join the club. Let me past! Ohh. Okay. That's it. All right. That's it, that's it. That's how you wanna play? Let's go, little. You guys, um... Isn't there a better way we could settle this? You guys realize this is why they formed the united nations. Come on, guys. Please. ( Staff splashes ) Oh, no! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! I told you! Little John: Ha ha ha! It's not funny. Ha ha ha! Oh! Oh! You know something? I hate soccer. Maybe I will join you guys' club after all. The most important thing about archery is that you're completely relaxed at the time you fire. The bow is stretched. There's tension in the string, but you-- you are totally at ease. Will: Awesome! All right, you try. Draw the string back a couple of times, just to get the feel for it. Yes! Good shot! Way to go. All right, will. It's hard to pull. Yeah, at the beginning, but then it gets easier as your arm gets stronger. Good shot. ( Arrow whizzes ) What?! Hey, why don't you watch where you're aiming that thing? If I was aiming for you, lard butt, I wouldn't have missed. Geez, what happened to you? You fall off one of those nags your parents are trying to sell? Why don't you wait your turn? We're practicing here. ( Chuckles ) No, you're not. The money for those targets comes from us. Yeah. They're private property. You want to practice? Dip into that lottery money, buy some of your own. I got a better idea. Why don't you girls take your arrows and go sit on 'em. ( Lads chuckling ) Who's gonna make us? You? Ow. Unh! Will: Hey! ( Audibly struggling ) Get off me, You little weasel! Guys? ( Blows whistle ) Hey, break it up! Get off! ( Indistinct comments ) Coach: Break it up. What's going on here, guys? They're using our archery targets, sir, and they are private property. If you don't believe us, ask Mr. Harvey, sir. My father and Mr. Harvey arranged it, sir. You-- you do know my father? Mr. McAllister, maybe you can get your own archery targets. Little, come on, you've missed enough soccer practice. Let's go. I, uh, I quit. Excuse me? I'm joining the new archery club-- Robin's new archery club. Coach: All right, guys, just keep away from them. It's not the targets. I mean, some people got everything and don't appreciate it, while others got nothing. I think it's called life Rob. Yeah, and in case you haven't heard, it stinks, man. Nurse on P.A.: Dr. Kennedy to O.R., code blue. Hey, Tommy. Brought you something. Hi. Wow. An electronic chess set? Thanks! Do you remember me? I'm Robin. Robin? From the 'hood? No, I go to Locksley. We met on the steps. Oh, yeah. That wasn't my week. Right here? So... How you feeling? Not too bad. This thing itches, though. Have you ever had an itch you can't scratch? Oh, I hate it when that happens. So, they told you when they're letting you out? They won't say. I want to go now. I can imagine. We should probably stick around till they tell you it's okay. I guess so. Can I get you anything? A new megaman would be good. I've read this one about 20 times already. Well, I'll tell you what-- I'll see what I can do for you, okay, Tommy? Rosie: Robbie, your friends are here! Send 'em up! Hey, Rob! Hey, guys. Hey, Rob! ( Will laughs ) Hey, wait a minute-- prince American corp.? What, are you stealing money from prince's old man? It's not like it's for me. Do you know how much money was donated to the tarla medical fund? A hundred and fifty stinking bucks! Nobody cares, and Tommy needs another operation, and operations cost. I already transferred money from my parents' account. I'll deal with that when they get home. Prince has got more money than he knows what to do with. You know that company raked in more than five billion last year? Shut up! See? My dad works for this big company. They give away money all the time. There are people there, that's all they do. Computer... List company charity divisions. Corporate division management. Told you. Permanent charities division. Cool. Let's see where they're sending the money to. ( Horse whinnies ) Permanent charities division, Lucille pettigrew, division manager. It's a girl! What? Robin: Come on, guys! Come on! Will: Hey! Hi! Hey! I got the 15 bucks for that family now. I don't need it anymore. What? I'll explain later. I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. Okay. See you later. ( Clicks tongue ) Rob-- Robin! Who was that babe on the horse? The wrangler's daughter. Computer, request further information on permanent charities division. Did you check out that outfit? Yeah, I think I'm going to take up horseback riding. Donations, year to date: $2.8 million. Wow! They do give a lot! So maybe they wouldn't mind giving a little more. Yeah, yeah, but just remember, it's not gonna be as easy to explain this as it will be to explain to your parents. I think I can increase the amount they give to existing charities and transfer it to the tarla medical account later. What's the date? The 22nd. Why? They're scheduled to make a big contribution in four days. Maybe it can be a little bigger. ( Chuckles ) You can do that? I can try. Computer, request code number for donation increases. Come on... Come on! Come on! Request denied. Nuts! Do not recognize this command. ( Laughing ) Nice work, Rob. Very impressive. You wanna try? Oh, um... Listen, I've got to get back to the dorm, so, you know, I'll see you later, man. Yeah, man, me too. You can't snag money off the net. No company's gonna be that dumb. You gotta be on the inside. Or sound like you are. ( Modem dialing ) ( Telephone ringing ) ( Telephone rings ) Mr. Prince's office. May I help you? ( Mature voice ) Mr. Prince, please. May I say who's calling? This is Edward... Forest. Forest. Mr. Forest-forest? No, no, no. Just... one forest. We went to school together. Just one moment, please. ( Sighs ) Thanks. Robin, are you up? Uh, yeah, Rosie. Mr. Prince, there's a Mr. Forest on line one. Says he went to school with you. Can I come in? No! Why not? Because i'm... Hello? ...Naked. Who are you talking to? Hello? Hi. No, I-I mean good morning, Mr. Prince. Forest? And you say we went to school together. Well, now, would that be Yale or choate? Oh, I'm sorry. This must be the wrong John prince. Sorry to bother you. ( Click ) Ethel? Yes, Mr. Prince? I didn't even know who that was. Do a better job of screening my calls, will you? I'm busy here. Aaarrgghhh! Forest. Now you say we went to school together? Would that be Yale or... Robin, are you all right? Yale or choate? Uh, I'm just playing a new video game. Well, hurry up and get dressed or you're gonna be late for school. I don't mind. Forest. ( Voices melding ) Now, you say we went to school together? Would that be Yale or choate? Forest. And you say we went to school together? Would that be Yale or choate? Yes! ( Modem dialing ) ( Telephone ringing ) Woman: Good morning, prince America corporation. Permanent charities, please. One moment, please. ( Telephones ringing ) Charities, this is Lucille. ( Prince, sr.'S voice ) Hello, Lucille? This is Mr. Prince. Mr. Prince? Good morning, Mr. Prince. Same to you, Lucille. Listen, on our greater Richmond youth foundation payment due on the twenty-sixth... Yes? Increase it by another $5,000, okay? I-Is that a permanent adjustment, sir? Uh, no. Just this one time. I'll see to it right away, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Prince. Thank you, Lucille. Goodbye. Yes! ( Indistinct comment ) John: And she bought it? Yep. There's 5,000 extra bucks in the Richmond youth account I can wire- transfer anywhere I want. Cool. See, I got their account number off e-mail. Nice. But how you gonna get it so they don't trace it back to you? Well, I haven't quite figured that out yet. That's easy. See, you phone banks all across the country, right, and you set up a bunch of fake bank accounts under a phony name. And then you bounce the money from one account to the other until you're not even sure where it's been. I saw it on one of those true crime shows. If the guy hadn't had a live gerbil sent to the post office box he was working out of, he never would have been caught. You're a genius. Get him! Ha! Noogies! Man: Taxi! So I can do all my banking electronically, right? Woman: Yes, but I will need a signature card for our files. Have it sent to you. Can you send it to my p.O. Box? It's hard for me to get into the bank. Of course, sir, and as soon as you return it to us with your deposit, you'll be in business. Cool. I mean, um, thank you. And thank you for choosing the people's bank of Seattle. Have a nice day. Okay. See you later. Uh, don't worry, ma'am. Everything checks out just fine. Yeah. We're with the phone company. Field testers. So, uh... ( Clearing throat ) Mr. Prince! Ms. Pettigrew, what is this? It's the $5,000 donation increase you requested for the greater Richmond youth foundation, sir. I did not request an increase. They get more than enough as it is. But the phone call... I... you... I want a full explanation, and I want it now. Boy: Hey, Bronson, wait up! Though it may seem cruel, man has long used lesser life forms to further his scientific knowledge, in yet another example of Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest. We dissect frogs so that we may better understand... ourselves. McAllister's a lesser life form. Maybe we should dissect him. Question, Mr. Prince? Yes, sir. I was just wondering if these frogs felt any pain as they left this world, sir. None at all, Mr. Prince, though it's very compassionate of you to ask. Thank you, sir. Such high praise, coming from you. Mm-hmm. Go ahead. Begin the dissection. Mr. Harvey, sir, can I ask you a question? Unh-unh. Let it go, munchkin. Sit down, fatso. Aahhh! Water! Water! Mr. McAllister! ( Gasping ) ( Lads laughing ) I suppose it would be too much to ask what you are doing! I had a frog in my... Spare me. Explain it all later... At detention. Is there anything I can do to help, sir? It's fine. Thank you. Nice shot. Thanks. I'm not bothering you, am I? No, not at all. Your dad called my dad today. They bought a horse! Great. Just what they need. Sounds like a beauty-- Chestnut stallion, four white stockings. Five-foot wingspread, three legs, and a beak. Yeah? Robin, you're not listening. ( Sighs ) Sorry. What'd you do, stay up all night? Pretty close. Look, can you keep a secret? Robin, you've got to stop it. Cancel it right away! No way! There's no more money in the medical fund. It's only been a couple of days. So? There's no more TV coverage. It's old news! They'll be lucky if they can get another ten bucks! You could go to jail. I'm too young to go to jail. Besides, we're not gonna get caught. I only took $5,000, and the prince American corporation donates something like $250,000 a year to charity anyways. Well, if they donate so much to charity anyway, why didn't you just ask for some? ( Sighs ) You can't just ask for money. You've got to have suction. And let's suppose I was to try to go through proper channels. You know how long that would take? Tommy needs that money now. But won't he need to pay it back anyway when you get caught? Look, I told you, we're not gonna get caught. You see, how it works is that-- Robin, don't even tell me. I don't want to hear it. Robin, I'm scared for you. Look, all I'm doing is ripping off the rich to give to the poor. I mean, what's wrong with that? I don't know. Something, probably. So you're gonna turn me in? No. Unless, of course, they torture me, or offer me money. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Got it right here. Looks good. Who the hell are you? Agent Walter Nottingham. F.b.i. This theft appears to have crossed state lines, Mr. Prince. That's why the detectives you reported it to turned it over to the f.B.I. Now, according to this file, your controller, miss pettigrew, says the order for the extra $5,000 came from you. No, it was someone impersonating me. Someone... or some thing? What do you mean? A computer microphone hooked up to a sound card can capture the wavelengths of a person's voice. ( Clanking sound overhead ) You're saying it was a computer? Run by someone who certainly knows what they're doing and has had access to your voice. Now, I'm gonna need a log of your phone calls from the date of the embezzlement going back as far as say, two weeks. Fine, fine. So it had to be someone who called me. Maybe. Maybe not. Any decent hacker could have tapped into your telephone conversations without your ever being aware of it. Maybe. Maybe not. Don't waste my time with maybes, Mr. Nottingham. I want you to catch this rodent. Fast! Yes, sir. Did you transfer the money into Tommy's medical fund yet? Hey, genius, there's a lot of steps. These things take time. I... thought you said it was easy? It is. For me. I'm... just being careful, that's all. Oh, no. Not this again. What? It's the renaissance faire Dean Harvey started last year. Yeah, he says he can make money for the school, but if you ask me, it's just another excuse to get him in tights. What are you gonna dress up as, little John? A pig? Shut up, Warner. Uh-oh. Piggy's getting angry. Hey, hey. Chill. They're not worth it. Hey. Check this out. An archery tournament. An all-comers! Looks like the rest of us will finally get a chance to shoot, huh? ( Chuckles ) Ahh. All you're gonna have a chance to do is embarrass yourself. Yeah? Well, just be there so I can see your face when my arrow hits the bull's-eye. Hey, man, forget 'em. We got more important things to do. We couldn't have done this at your house? Yeah, but this is better. You see, the more computers I log on to, the harder it is to trace. Here it goes. It's finally arrived in the Seattle accounts. So, uh, who's William Johnson? Nobody. It's a name I used for the accounts. Now, all I need is the account number for Tommy's medical fund. Bingo. I am so good. Modest too. And don't forget handsome. Definitely handsome. ( Triumphal sounds ) There it goes. What, that's it? All five thousand bucks? Just like that. All right, Robin! Yeah! Gentlemen, please. This is a computer lab, not a sports bar. Sorry, Mr. Harvey, sir. We were just excited about the learning potential when one accesses the information superhighway on the Internet, Mr. Harvey, sir. What are you working on? ( Overlapping comments ) Actually, sir, it's an independent project that we've been working on. Mm-hmm. Well, that's fine. ( Exhales ) But make sure you do your regular schoolwork first, hmm? For sure. Thank you, sir. Nottingham? John prince here. What's the latest? We traced the diverted funds to the first bank of Manhattan. So the thief's in New York? Well, why didn't you call me? I have friends there. Because the money has already been wire-transferred to the Gulf bank of St. Petersburg. What? So he's in Florida? Could be a she. The funds were then transferred to Chicago guaranteed trust. Chicago? Well, then, let me guess. They're not there anymore. The bank manager's checking to see where they went, but in each instance, the name on the account-- William Johnson. False address, false social security number. So this "Johnson" could be anyone? No. No. Someone very specific, and very smart. All right, take your stance. Relax. All right! Let's go, little. See what you got. There you go. Man, you are deadly! I'll never be that good. Keep practicing. I mean, who knows? Just think how much better you are now than when you first started. Yeah. All right! We're gonna sweep that all-comers. I mean, you guys can fight for second, and, of course, I'll take first, right? Marion: Hey, Robin. Hey. What's up, Marion? Would you close your mouth? Your gonna drool on your bow. Marion fitzwater, this is will Scarlet and John little, otherwise known as little John. Hey. Hey! They're doing time at Locksley too. John: Uhhh.... Haven't seen you around much lately. Oh, well, I've been kind of busy. With your, uh, computer project? Yeah. You told her? What, you don't think you can trust me? I-I'd trust you with my life. ( Groans ) So, how's it going, though? Great. Listen, um, you've got to swear you won't say anything. ( Telephone rings ) St. ignacios parish. Father tuck speaking. ( Mature voice ) Hi, father tuck? I'm calling to see if you received a donation recently for the tarla medical fund. Yes. Uh, are you Mr. Johnson? No, no, no. No. An associate. No, I'm his associate. Mr. Johnson just wanted to know if you received the money. Oh, yes we did, praise god. Five thousand dollars transferred into the account like manna from heaven. Uh, if I could, though, I... Really would like to thank Mr. Johnson personally. So would the tarlas. Uh, I'm afraid that's impossible. Mr. Johnson's a very shy man. A hermit practically. He hates publicity. Well, I wouldn't want to intrude on his privacy, but, uh, please give him our deepest gratitude. Yeah, I will. Goodbye. Bye-bye. ( Marion giggles ) A hermit? Okay, it was a little lame. At least they got the money and we got away with it. So you can stop now, right? I guess so. You guess so? Are you crazy? You're right. Why take our chances? I'll close the accounts as soon as I can. Promise? ( Door opens ) Yeah, I promise. Would your friends like to stay for dinner, Robin? Uh, guys? Uh, no, thank you. Uh, yeah. We have to be getting back to the dorm. I have to go too. Remember, you promised. I know. I was thinking of going to see Tommy in the hospital tomorrow. Would you like to come? Sure. Good. 'Cause I was talking to his mother, and she said he could really use the company. ( P.A. announcement ) Doctor: Let me reassure you, Mr. and Mrs. Tarla, Tommy's doing very well. I just examined him, had a look at his x-rays and his lab tests, and I'm fully confident one more procedure on Tommy's leg will restore full function. Another operation? Well, there's a lot of medical jargon I could give you, but let's just say yes, Tommy needs it. Thank you, doctor. Nurse on P.A.: All available personnel to the west wing, code white. Well, that's wonderful news, isn't it? Tommy will be good as new. Yes, but the money in the fund barely covers the cost to date. That's not enough for another operation. Father tuck: Now, Mark, I know you're worried about the costs, but have faith. Somehow the lord will provide. Yes, i'm sure he will. Robin, come and say hello to the tarlas. Hi. This is Robin McAllister. He and Tommy go to school together. Well, you're a lucky boy. Locksley's a fine school. Yeah, I-I guess it is. You know, it's funny, but I feel like I know you somehow. Um, I don't think so. No? ( Chuckles ) And how is little Tommy, father? Oh, he is doing better, though the additional surgery is gonna cost more than it was first thought, even with the money from Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson? $10,000 more? ( Laughing ) Blessed father, thank you for sending us Mr. Johnson, and if he's committed any sins in his life, forgive him! And if he wishes to remain a mystery man, let him! ( Soft knock ) Robin? It's Marion. Rosie isn't here, but the door was open, so i-- Robin? Father tuck? What's this? What were you doing in my room? Looking for you, and don't change the subject! You told me you were going to stop. I know, but I couldn't. Tommy needs another operation, and father tuck's-- you think father tuck would accept that money if he knew how you got it? That's why I didn't tell him. You can't keep ripping off that company! I know. That's why I branched out. No! How many? Well... This is to let father tuck know about number three, all transferred from companies run by fathers of the richest snobs at Locksley. I'm not gonna let you send it. It's already in the medical fund. Well, then, take it out! Put it back where you got it! Do you want Tommy to walk with a limp for the rest of his life? I mean, do you want him not to be able to play baseball or ride a bike just because he broke some bones and there's not enough money to pay for it? Is that what you want? Of course I don't. Neither do I. It's been ten days since I popped the prince American corporation. Let me show you how easy it was. Sure that's a good idea? They might have set a trap. Don't worry. All I'm gonna do is joyride through their e-mail. Look at that. What? They're producing eight hundred million in sales this quarter alone. What's a measly 5,000 to them? They probably won't even notice, huh? Female voice: Audit notice. Uh-oh. What? They noticed. This is Mr. Prince, prince American corporation. This is kind of embarrassing, but we just discovered that the $5,000 embezzlement I reported was actually a clerical error. The truth is, nothing's missing. No need to look any further, but thanks loads for your help. 'Bye. No need to look any further, but thanks loads for your help. 'Bye. "Thanks loads for your help"? I don't think so. That's right, close the account. Thank you. Well? Done. All of it? Closed every account. What if they keep looking for you? There's nothing left to find. I mean, it's the f.B.I. Don't you think they have better things to do than look for a... Measly $30,000? $30,000?! I jacked up the donations the last couple of times. Tommy really needed it. Tommy needed it, or you need it? Hey, this has nothing to do with me! Oh, this has everything to do with you-- how smart you are, how much you want to show up those rich kids at school! You're wrong. Okay, maybe not totally, but it's over. Done. I mean, there's no way they can catch me now! Robin, I'm worried. So don't think about it. Don't think about it? Yeah. You're crazy. Crazy, wacko, bonkers, mad! ( Laughing ) What is that? I'm just dancing. Dancing? It looks more like you stepped in something out in the corral. You're saying you can do better? This horse could do better. Go ahead. Show us how it's done. Okay. Come on. What, you need me? Real dancing takes two people, like this. No. Come on, I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay, give me your hand. Like this. Put your other hand on me. Little higher. Sorry. 'Kay, it's gonna start slow, and then quick. Okay. Start with this foot. Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow. Slow, slow, quick-quick-- oww! ( Giggles ) Sorry. Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow. Quick-quick, slow. Good! Can we stop now? No. Slow, slow, quick-quick, slow. Slow, slow, quick-quick-- you know, you're not actually a total spaz. You tell my friends, I'll never talk to you again. ( Chuckles ) You ready? Go ahead. Are you ready? What? For this. ( Marion giggles ) ( Horse whinnies ) ( Marion giggles ) So, you're closing in on him? I must be. You left a message on my answering machine last night saying that the embezzlement was a clerical error, that I should drop the whole case. I did no such thing! Of course not. It was the thief. Had to be. But I'll tell you, he's got your voice programmed about as well as it can be done, I'll give him that. Well, wouldn't he realize that you'd check with me to confirm the message? You'd think so. He obviously knows he's been discovered. Maybe he panicked. Maybe he's just creating whatever diversions he can to, uh, cover his tracks before we find him. So how are you going to find him? Well, for one thing, I found out where your money ended up. And where is that? ( Nut ricochets ) A bank... in Seattle. Seattle? That mean something to you? Not really. My son goes to boarding school there, but... How, uh, how old's your son? Sixteen. Why? That's a tough age. How do you two get along? You're not suggesting that my son had anything to do with this? Sixteen-year-old boy, sent off to boarding school far from home. He wouldn't be the first kid to act out by stealing something. That's ridiculous. My son does not need $5,000. I've always given him everything he wants! ( Voice breaking ) You sure about that? Has any other money been siphoned out of your account, business or personal? No. Why? A total of $30,000 was funneled through that Seattle account. Now, your son's school, I imagine it's-- it's pretty exclusive. Some of the finest families in this country send their sons there. And I suppose some of their fathers, they run companies big enough to have permanent charities departments. I suppose so. What of it? I'll order spot audits, see if any funds have gone unaccounted for. We may just be seeing the tip of the iceberg. Where are you going? Seattle. Doesn't that get boring? No. Doesn't riding? No. Well, neither does this. Hop down, I'll show you. I don't think so. Why? I let you teach me how to dance. Okay. You hold it vertically, like this. It feels uncomfortable this way. Oh, I'm sorry. You know more about this than I do. Go ahead. Whoops! Geez, Marion, you probably killed someone! The cops are gonna be out here looking for suspects! Oh, a little paranoid, are we? ( Sighs ) I told you, there's nothing to worry about. Okay. So... Are you gonna come? To what? The archery contest. The all-comers. I'm gonna win that money for my parents, put that kid in his place. Do you really want me to? Oh, I don't care. Whatever. Liar. We're not suggesting your bank has done anything improper, ma'am. We'd just like your help stopping this Mr. Johnson. Oh, my. What? Since I talked to you, Mr. Johnson's account has been closed. What did he do with the money? I'm not sure. Looks like some sort of electronic transfer. I could try to find out where, but it will take some time. We'd appreciate it. Here's where you can reach us. So... no one here ever saw this Mr. Johnson in person? 'Fraid not. Uh, his account was opened and funded over the phone and through the mail. Mailing address was a local p.O. Box, paid for in advance, in cash. This guy's good. The rest of the money came from two other companies with permanent charity departments, Gibson amalgamated steel and Warner scientific industries, and guess what-- young Warner and Gibson both go to Locksley. Kind of makes you wonder what they're teaching them out there. John: Hey, wait up! Come on, let's go! We're late! ( Lads chuckling ) Boy: Stop it! I'm sorry, are we bothering you? Leave me alone! ( Bullies laughing ) Not until you pay the tax. Yeah, you little runt, you gotta pay the tax. What tax? ( Mockingly ) The wimp tax. Don't you guys have anything better to do than act like jerks all day? Stop squirming. Hold him. Like what? Kick your butts at some lame archery contest? At least that'd be a fair fight. ( Prince laughs ) A fair fight? You against me, McAllister? I wouldn't call that fair. Boy: Leave me alone. ( Laughing ) A fair fight! Aahhh! Warner! Gibson! Get him! Get him! Careful! Don't wanna hurt yourselves! Get off me! All right! Yeah! Sweet! Now all we gotta do is win that contest! If we live that long! Bad guys at ten! Gentlemen! How many times...? Mr. Prince, Warner, Gibson, these men would like a word with you. ( All panting ) John: Yes! Robin: Come on, let's get outta here. I'll tell you, Warner, if that brat of yours coerced John, Jr., into this scam, I'm gonna-- look, don't threaten me, prince. My son would never do something like this. ( Prince, sr. Scoffs ) Neither would mine. Well, I can't argue with you there, Lyle. Your son's too dumb to embezzle funds by computer. ( Nottingham clears throat ) Father. Dad. Wipe that smirk off your face. Whatever you know, son, out with it. And if you even think of lying, I'll not only take you out of Locksley, I'll shut the place down. Yes, sir. So I take it you're satisfied that none of those boys is involved? Reasonably. Gum? First of all, none of them smart enough to pull it off. And they were so scared of their daddies, they wouldn't have lied about it if they were. For your information, their "daddies" happen to be three of this school's most important benefactors, and I will not have their good names-- I know, Mr. Harvey. They're all loaded, just like the rest of the families who send their sons here. That's why I'm convinced this Locksley connection is no coincidence. Here's a court order giving us full access to your files, as well as authority to tap the phone lines. At Locksley? Something's going on here, Dean. Something big. And we're gonna find out what it is. ( Comical groan ) Man. Thirty grand. I wish I had stolen that money. And all by computer. That's fresh. But why'd they have to pick our fathers' companies to steal the money from? I thought they were going to kill us. For thirty grand, I'd take my chances. Ohh! With the f.B.I.? With anybody. That's some serious money. The f.B.I. Thought it was those bozos! I love it! I don't. It's too close to the truth. Come on! The cops are just guessing. There's no way they can pin it on us... Is there? I don't know. You don't know? We are talking about the f.B.I., man. They always get their guy. That's the mounties, dimwit. You know, like in Canada. Look, either they figured out the connection with Locksley or they tracked the money back to the local bank. Maybe even both. They can do that! With the banks, I mean. On that t.V. Show I saw, the guy got around it by transferring his money someplace called, uh... ...the caveman islands, man. You mean the Cayman Islands. Yeah! Yeah, that's it! Supposedly when you put your money there, it's the only place where it's completely untraceable. And you didn't bother to mention this little detail? Uh... I forgot. Look, maybe it's not too late. Come on. Okay, okay, relax. First I can shift the Seattle account to the Cayman Islands, then I can access each of the closed bank account records and make it look like I transferred it all over the place. I mean, I'm talking Chicago to Phoenix, Cayman to new Mexico, then everything will work out just the way we planned because the Cayman island transfers are completely... All: Untraceable! Are you sure you can do that? It's worth a try. As much as it costs to go here, I can understand why some kid would want to pick up some extra cash. It's bigger than that, seals. Much bigger than that. The more I look at it, the more I'm convinced the thefts we've discovered are just the tip of the ice... cube. Giant. I can see the tip, but there's more...! Agent Nottingham! I'm picking up an outgoing call to the Cayman Islands. Cayman Islands? It's a modem transmission to a bank there. Where's it coming from? Downstairs. There. Computer lab. Come on! Come on, I'm trying to send you money! What?! "Warning! Your phone line is not secure. Please check and try again"? Not secure? What does that mean? It means someone's listening in. We've got to get out of here! Man: Computer lab's on your right! There it is! Robin: Go, go, go, go! All right, mister. What do you think you're doing? My homework. ( Knock on door ) Robin? Yeah? Are you all right? You hardly ate any of your dinner. Guess I wasn't hungry. Well, maybe you'll feel more like eating tomorrow when your parents get home. Did they think they'd be able to make it to your archery tournament? They weren't sure. They said they'd try. Well, if you get hungry later, there's leftovers in the fridge, all right? Rosie? You know what you said when I first started Locksley, about having gifts, and that I should use them? Yeah, I remember. Well... What if they didn't turn out the way you wanted? What if they actually kind of sucked? Are you in some kind of trouble, Robbie? No. You see, I have this friend, and he did what he thought was right, something he was good at, but it didn't turn out the way he expected. Tell your friend that as long as he acted from his heart, even if it didn't turn out the way he planned, it'll be all right. People will understand. Thanks, Rosie. Gentlemen! Are we making any progress? I dearly hope that you'll be done with this awful business soon! We are making progress, Mr. Harvey. Tell me... What, uh, what kind of student is Peter Grossman? Excellent. His two brothers were graduated from Locksley. His father's income last year was $55,000. Now, it costs, what? Twenty-eight-five to go here for a full year? Give or take. Yeah. They give and he takes. Mm-hmm. Well, that's cutting it pretty close, don't you think? Boy, they must live in a tent! Mrs. Grossman, I believe, has a substantial trust fund. Um... what does it matter if Peter's a good student or not? Our suspect is extremely bright. How 'bout this, uh... Robin McAllister? Good student? I wouldn't know. Mr. McAllister spends most of his time in my class comatose. ( Nottingham laughing ) How 'bout his, uh, test scores? I.q. Tests and the like? Well, there is that. Yes, he tests very high. I see his, uh, his parents, they won the lottery. Yeah. Twenty million, I believe. ( Nottingham whistles sharply ) We don't really approve of gambling here, but, um... Now, they don't-- they don't get the $20 million all at once, do they, Mr. Harvey? I wouldn't know about such things. Usually it's paid out over 20 years-- not that I'd turn it down. They bought a horse ranch. Mm-hmm. A hundred acres. ( Soft chuckle ) How much something like that go for in an area like this? Five million, easy. So you figure twenty percent down payment. There goes the first check, right? It's gone, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Tell me something, Mr. Harvey, have you seen him around lately? No, um, as I recall, they've been out of the country for the last few weeks. Out of the country? You don't say. Cayman Islands, by any chance, Mr. Harvey? ( Distant horse whinnies ) Father tuck: You're Tommy's Friend, from school. Robin McAllister. Robin. That's right. I was just talking to someone from Locksley. Mister, uh, Mr. Harvey. He has kindly agreed to let us have a booth at your renaissance fair. We're always looking for ways to raise a little money, you know. Right. So, Robin, what can I do for you? Oh, um... I was just wondering, how's Tommy doing? Oh, much better. Much better. In fact, they'll probably send him home pretty soon. Once they pay the bill, that is. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. What, paying the bill? Yeah. You see... My friends and I, well, we felt sorry for Tommy, and... we want to do something good, so, um, we kind of... Yes? We, um... We were wondering if you still needed money. No, my son. But I'm deeply moved by the offer. But thanks to a generous benefactor who wishes to remain anonymous, all of Tommy's medical bills will be taken care of. We are truly blessed! I'm truly dead. Agent Nottingham. F.B.I. Looking for a Robin McAllister. Wondering if he might be somewhere nearby. Just a minute. Marion? Hey, Rosie, what's up? There's some men over there who are looking for Robin, but you haven't seen him, right? No, I haven't seen him. If you happen to see him, tell him that I meant what I said-- that as long as his heart is in the right place, everything is going to be fine. Is in the right place, everything is going to be fine. Hello? Robin? Marion? So you really think it was the f.B.I.? I don't know. They sure looked like it. They know. I guess I'm not as smart as I thought I was. Maybe not, but you're probably the smartest person I've ever met. So how did I get myself into this mess? Well, in your own crazy, immature way, you were trying to do something good. Thanks a lot. No, I mean it. It's like what Rosie said-- if your heart was in the right place, everything will be fine. People will understand. Yeah, well, she never met prince's dad. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Be myself, I guess. ( Horn blows feeble fanfare ) Barker: Come on, Don't be shy! Don't be shy! ( Indistinct conversations ) Barker: Step right up, sir! ( Playing medieval music ) ( Shouts of approval ) That was great. ( Onlookers laughing ) It all fits. This, uh, Robin McAllister must be some kind of computer genius. You think the parents are in on it? Oh, they gotta be. No kid in the world would think this up on his own. Yeah, but they just won $20 million in the lottery. So they say, so they say. My guess is they stole that money by computer hacking. This whole lottery story's a front. Nah, this is a major crime ring, seals. I can feel it right in my gut. ( Happy chatter ) This is just like money in the bank! Guys. Check your watches. You all know what to do. Let's do it. Let's go. Let's do it. ( Women laughing ) Man: That's a good idea! ( Ongoing happy chatter ) ( Ongoing happy chatter ) Where's Robin? I can't believe he's not here. Maybe we're gonna have to win this one for him. That's what you think! Robin! Shh! I don't want anybody to know I'm here. Where's prince? I haven't seen him. It's a pleasure to see you again, my lady. Come on! What? Hear ye, hear ye! Gather round, ladies and gentlemen! The Locksley academy all-comers archery tournament is about to begin! Each Archer will get two shots from 40 feet, two from 60 feet, and two from 80 feet. This is a winner-take-all competition! First prize... One thousand dollars! ( Shouts of approval ) Entries are now closed! Archers with the lowest scores in each round will be eliminated until we finally have our winner! Our first Archer is... Prince, Jr.: Get out of my way! Nothing like making an entrance. Who cares? It's how you leave that's important. Mr. Harvey, sir. Are we too late? Um, as a matter of fact, entries are... ( Clears throat ostentatiously ) Is there some sort of problem here? Uh, no sir, Mr. Prince. No, no problem at all. Add their names to the list. Get ready for the tournament. Disperse! Son, it's up to you to make my trip out here worthwhile. Hey, isn't that that horse I wanted you to buy me? Well, you'd better win this thing, hadn't you? ( Cell phone rings ) Prince, sr.: Out of my way! Hello? Yes! Gentlemen. Gentlemen. You ready? ( Faint chuckle ) Mr. Harvey: Let the tournament begin! ( Cheers and applause ) ( Shouts of approval ) Yes! ( Shouts of approval ) Yes! Yes! Mr. Harvey: Excellent! That completes the 40-foot round! The top ten archers will continue after the targets are moved back to the 60-foot Mark. Hey, thanks, Sam, you were great. Excusez-moi, s'il vous plait. All clear! The McAllisters just arrived. Get your men in place. We'll take them as soon as this is over. Janet: Robin! Hi! Onlookers: Ohhh! Oh. That's okay, son! Onlookers: Ohh! ( Applause ) Onlookers: Ohh! Next time. Next year. Win it for me, man. Concentrate. Onlookers: Ohh! You gotta do this for us, man. Mr. Harvey: The final four archers will now compete at a distances of 80 feet! All clear! ( Onlookers applaud ) Onlookers: Ohh! Onlookers: Ohh! Onlookers: Ohh! Onlookers: Ohh! ( Applause ) That's my son. Yes! It's a tie! Mr. Harvey: Hear ye, hear ye! The final two archers each have one shot left! Whoever scores higher, wins! I will flip a coin to see who goes first! Mr. Prince, you call it. Heads. Heads it is. Your choice. I'll go first. So, what do you say, hotshot? You up for a challenge? Why don't we move the targets back? Say... the hundred-foot Mark? No problem. Man: All clear! Move it back! Hundred-foot Mark. Move it back, all the way. A hundred feet. Come on! What are you looking at your old man for? I'm the guy you've got to beat. All clear. ( Indistinct chatter ) Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! ( Onlookers react ) It's a perfect bull's-eye! Not bad. Well, I'm here, and I'm looking at your face with my arrow in the middle of the bull's-eye. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, this is almost done. Yeah. ( Cheers and applause ) ( Cheers and applause ) And the winner is... Robin McAllister! ( Cheers and applause ) All set. Yeah, let's go. Congratulations, son! Oh, honey, we're really proud of you. Uh... thanks, mom, but, um, hold that thought. Mr. and Mrs. McAllister? Yes? Agent Walter Nottingham. F.b.i. I'd like a word with you, please. Wait. It's me you have to talk to. You? No, no, no, no. I think I know who the masterminds here are. No, no, no, no. Really. I did everything, on my own. And nobody else knows anything about it. Look... I was the one that took all the money from your companies. Not for me. For charity. For Tommy. He's Mr. Johnson? Yep. ( Laughing ) Please! But you're-- you're only 16 years old. Let's go, son. How's your gut feel now? Yeah, but he's only 16! He's a-- he's not Mr. Johnson! Seals, he's only...! Okay, everybody! Everybody! Let's get on with the fair! Janet: Oh, Robbie! Oh, Robbie! How could you have done this to us? I mean, how could you have ruined your life? Your life? Our lives? I mean, how? I just wanted to do something good for Tommy. You know, I know that, son, and for that, I am very proud of you. What?! He stole money! I am not saying I'm proud of how he did it. Stealing is never justified, no matter how good the cause. I know. Truth is, your mother and I could learn something from you. We could? Oh, come on, hon. Let's face it-- ever since we won that money, we haven't been thinking about anything except ourselves and what we wanted. I guess you could say we have been... a little... Preoccupied. Oh, we sure have. You know, the truth is, I think Robin did it just to get our attention. No, I did it 'cause I thought it'd be cool. But I was wrong, and... I see that now. Anyway, I am gonna make sure that that family gets enough money till they get back on their feet. Oh. Well, dad, you kind of already helped. But we'll talk about that later. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, fine, fine. I get the picture. ( Sighs ) My overpriced attorney has just pointed out how it's going to look if we choose to prosecute a 16-year-old boy for stealing a piddling amount of money to pay some poor kid's hospital bill. I'd hardly call $30,000 a piddling amount. It's not the money, it' the principle. Who cares about he principle? It's the public relations! So guess what-- not only am I not going to press charges, but from now on, prince enterprises is going to include St. ignacios parish on its list of permanent charities, and if I'm gonna do that, so are both of you. ( Telephones ringing ) Warner. Prince. Gibson. Just a minute. Hold on. All: It's for you. Marion: Hi. Hey. How's it going? Well, I've almost got the church's finances pulled up to the 20th century. Just in time for the 21st? Yeah. Don't tell nobody, but, as far as this punishment thing goes, it's actually kind of fun. I was wondering, you want to go to a movie tonight? I can't. Part of my probation's that I've got to be in before dark. What about a matinee Saturday? Got community service all day Saturday. Okay, let's make this easy-- what can you do, and when can you do it. Well, I'm free on sunday-- after church, that is. What was that for? For being you. ( Faint chuckle ) Come on. I want to show you something. What's this? Sherwood archery club, youth division. The most important thing about archery is that you're completely relaxed at the time that you fire. The bow is stretched, there's tension in the string, but you are totally at ease. Would you quit blabbing and let the kid shoot? Bravo, Tommy! Not bad. I did it, I did it! This archery's a good thing for these kids. Teaches them discipline, concentration. Next year we should have our own faire, with our own archery contest. Sounds good to me. Maybe we can get that Mr. Johnson to put up the prize money. Oh, wait a minute. Don't look at me 'cause, you know, I'm through with that. That's it.
