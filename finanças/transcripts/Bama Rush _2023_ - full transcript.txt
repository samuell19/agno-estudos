Just because I saw it so much, so I looked into the school. Being in a sorority will kind of help me figure out who I want to be, help me be surrounded by people that will always have my back, no matter what.

In 1883, a professor at Harvard wrote a book called "Sex in Education." The basis of his argument is that if women studied, then the blood would go to their brains and not their ovaries, and that they would shrivel up and... and the women would die. ♪ Imagine it's in this environment that these women are going to college, and in the face of that, they're coming together to form these early sororities. The emphasis was very much on showing that women could succeed in higher education. They were feminists in many ways before that was a word. ♪ And into the early 1910s, more and more women are coming to campus. The first generation has proven that they're successful. In the second generation, the sororities become more focused on parties, on socializing, and on showing that they are the best representatives of true womanhood on campus. The whole notion of Rush came because they were rushing to show themselves as the best sororities on campus to attract the best members. They would meet the trains that the new students were taking to get to campus, literally whisking them off and trying to woo and win over the best members of the new class. ♪ So this is my Rush binder, because I have OCD, so it's just going to be organized by each sorority, with each recruitment letter, and then I'm probably gonna have a mock-up of my recruitment letter of how I'll send it out to each person in here as well. I'm definitely going to do Google slides of my outfits, and I'm gonna have them pre-planned and packed in a separate bag, so that way, if I still need to unpack some stuff after my parents leave or while I'm rushing, like, at night time, I can unpack that, but I want to have all my Rush stuff ready to go. When did you know you wanted to be in a sorority at Alabama? Yes, so I started watching Gracie O'Connor, who's on YouTube. It made me want to go there even more. She was like, so adorable and fun, and I was like, that looks like so much fun and I want that. Here it is. It's my final look. Got this super cute tassel earrings, bracelets, and the necklace. When Bama Rush Tok blew up, you know, I had plenty of people commenting, "Don't forget the OG, Gracie O'Connor." And I'm like, me? ♪ At the University of Alabama, Rush consists of four highly competitive rounds that give sororities and potential new members the chance to make the best possible impression on one another. And during these rounds, the sororities vote on their top PNMs, and the PNMs vote on their top sororities. They're trying to find the perfect match. [ Indistinct conversations ] Basically what happens is there's multiple girls that gets to talk to one PNM. That amount of girls will get to vote on her. If she gets high enough votes or if we like her, then she'll come back. Over the course of the week, the girls return to fewer and fewer sororities, whether they were dropped or chose to drop certain sororities along the way. Active members are looking for girls that we can see futures in and that are going to, like, literally uphold our chapter and make us better in all aspects, whether that be grades or, like, how we present ourselves to the universe. If you're not meeting a certain criteria, you'll kind of just be dropped. After the final round, PNMs choose their top sorority and the sororities select their new pledge class. It comes down to, like, crunch time, and no one wants to make any decisions on anybody's girl, but someone has to. And so we're just, like, crying through the process. Like, it's never easy. That part sucks. [ Crying ] It's way more dramatic than you're thinking it is. [ Laughing ] Like, it's way... And I'm not going to tell you how hard it is. I'm so sorry. I can't. This all leads up to Bid Day. The PNMs meet at Bryant-Denny Stadium and open envelopes containing the name of the sorority that they've been invited to join, and hopefully, it's their top choice. After the PNMs open their invitations, they run back to their forever home with the new sisters in their pledge class. ♪ Rush has gotten so competitive over the past decade that I really saw a need for our services and what we do to help prepare girls to go through Rush and hopefully get them into the house of their dreams. I remember when we were going through recruitment at Georgia, we would all be looking at what Alabama was doing. Yeah, they're just the trend setters. And I think that's why so many out-of-state girls decide to go to the University of Alabama and Rush. It's just this beast, because Greek life is everything at Alabama. The University of Alabama is the top sorority recruitment in all of the country, and it's a huge school with tons of money rolling into it for their football program. The girls are, like, glammed to the gods. It sucks you in. Rush at the University of Alabama traditionally has kind of a bad rap. It's kind of a cutthroat process. It's just uniquely, uniquely Alabama, which doesn't really make much sense, but... [ Chuckles ] I'm still holding out that we're gonna be able to get into those houses. What do you think? Oh.

Honestly, what makes me mad is that in our sorority, like, we're so understanding, and it's the people that, like, hate on us, and they stereotype us I'm like, y'all are the mean ones, not us. Like, we don't do anything. What do we do? Sit there and eat our chicken sandwiches together? Like, what? We don't do anything. We put a lot... A lot of pressure on ourselves. Example, right here of my sweet little girls. - Are you editing us? - Yep. - So, like, let's just say... - Let me look at that. We want to make Lauren's arm smaller. We can go like this.

If you want to make your waist thinner to make yourself feel better about posting it online, I understand, but the problem is, is that these women with millions of followers 14-year-old girls are gonna look at that and be like, "Why don't I look that way?" Post that and act like it's real. The things that I say to myself and think to myself about my body, I would never say that to someone else. You know, when you're living with other women and, like, you're around other women all the time that, you know, I think are very beautiful girls... You know, I would kill to look like any of my friends. You know, it's hard to be like, "That's okay that I don't look like them." Everyone has, like, their important qualities that aren't affected by how prettier you think your friends are or, like, how you want your hair to look like her hair. It doesn't change who you are and who... like, what people really value you for. Okay, great. So there's just a few more questions and we can, like, go through. Well, interim question that has nothing to do with this, - but just out of curiosity... - Yes? Nobody in my family is even, like, bald from just being an older man. Do you put sunscreen on your head? - Yes! - Yes, right? - That's what I thought. Yeah. - So much. So much, because, like, I could never get skin cancer on my head. - Yeah, what would you do? - This is my whole thing. Right. That's terrible. It's actually stressful at the beach. I can... Right? You must have to do a hat, right? With summer, yeah, I do hats and I do turbans. Mm-hmm. Okay, I think I know where I'm going with this. Between Katie, this smart, beautiful girl, telling me that she wishes she looked like her friends or she compares herself to other women and the endless scrolling of these OOTDs, it hit me. I feel like I rushed, too. And just stay with me on this... In these OOTDs, these girls are showing us their earrings, their necklaces, their outfits that they put on to look like they belong in a sorority. And I feel like I rushed because I have alopecia and I wore a wig for 14 years. I wore a different wig every year. I wore a mullet, a bowl cut, a blunt cut, a body wave, a perm... I wore a layered look. My Rush looked different. I was trying to get into the sorority of all of the girls in the world who have hair, and it felt like an impossible sorority to get into. I was going to compete for my position, and my wig was a secret. If you found out that I wore a wig, if you even questioned that I wore a wig, it would shatter me. So I know it's not exactly like the Alabama Rush, but it's like, not that different. I think the competition mostly comes from the rankings of sororities, trying to get in one of those top or middle-tier houses and not getting into a bottom house. I visited the University of Alabama, observing the sorority Rush parties. I probably saw five or six houses. Rush is a social stratification ritual bar none. Stratification in the sense of organizing people and groups of people into tiers of power, of status, of prestige. It's a proving ground of competitive femininity and the contemporary performance of the Southern belle. - Hey, y'all. - Hey, y'all. Hey, y'all. Do you think I would get into a top-tier house? You wouldn't get in with those shoes. You got to have cute shoes. [ Both laugh ] Who determines the rankings? I have no idea, to be honest. Actually, I'm going to give you my potential thoughts on it. I think a lot of the times people like to rank... And by people, I usually mean fraternity boys or boys in general, I feel like they're like, "Oh, this house has the hottest girls, so they're a top house." Like, "These freshmen are the hottest freshmen, so they're going to be considered a top house." ♪ The potential new members are trying to get in, but also, these sororities are trying to get, like, the best girls. - For sure. - What does that even mean? Yeah, so, the ranking system, I truly believe it's based on the fraternities. ♪ So essentially, they have a social calendar, and they get to mix with certain sororities, but it's only a limited amount, and the fraternities want to be mixing with the hottest sororities, of course, 'cause, you know, they're 20-year-old males. So that's kind of where the ranking system comes from. They want to make sure the girls who are wearing their letters are up to their standards. ♪ The hierarchy of sororities that exist here really determines how your experience in the Greek system is going to be. There are a lot of things that you're entitled to when you're in a top-tier sorority. You're entitled to test banks that are going to help you on your exams. You're entitled to people in your sorority that have better connections, whether their parents are richer or more connected. You're entitled to a male gaze that might be a little bit more beneficial to you. And so, you know, being in a bottom-tier sorority, I have to understand that at some point, there's nothing that I can do to change institutionalized rankings. You know, Sigma Kappa, we've done all the right things, but we'll never be anything but bottom tier for at least the next 20, 30 years, because that's just how it works here. You guys, as far as we have heard, are considered like, a top-tier sorority. - I... - I mean, I'm not going to lie. Like, whenever I tell someone what sorority I'm in, and they're like, "Oh, wow," that's flattering. I think it's hard. We kind of have to tiptoe around this question, because we would be naive to deny that lots of people recognize us as a top tier... "top tier" house. But do I think there are other great sororities? - Absolutely. - Absolutely. ♪ [ Dog barking in distance ] [ Engine shuts off ] ♪ So this is basically the Shelby Taj Mahal. That's what my family calls it. But these are awards from dance competitions. I volunteer with children with special needs and we race, and the girl that I raced with got first place.

Definitely. So this is my pageant binder. This is my life when I competed in pageants, so it's kind of why I wanted to do the sorority Rush binder for myself. I will have kind of the similar things in here for Rush. I'll definitely have a motivation tab of just a ton of quotes and stuff for me to look at. I like the paper copy because I like to be able to feel it and really look at it, 'cause sometimes when you're in the moment and you're stressed out and you're worried, you forget all the things that you've been taught.

Some of them are like, "Oh, are you kidding me right now?" We are not allowed to drink in our letters whatsoever. I don't think in any of the sorority houses, - you can have alcohol. - Why is that, do you know? It must be a Panhellenic rule, because fraternities are always allowed, and the amount of alcohol in that house is disgusting. [ Laughs ] Another rule that I just thought was really dumb... No wet hair in the house on the first floor. I know there was one house that my roommate was in freshman year. She told me that they literally could not leave the dorm unless they had two out of three done, which was either you had to have your hair done, makeup done, or outfit on. All it takes is one person to know what chapter you're in and like, to reach out to somebody, and you can be in trouble the next day. ♪ Like, as far as our rules, we have just the longest COC in the entire universe, our code of conduct. The ones I usually get in trouble for are like, disrespecting a sister, which is such a subjective thing, and really makes our standards process kind of a joke sometimes.

Again, you have to be "pretty enough" to get in. I would say they only really, truly matter at round one. ♪ Just from talking to women all over the country, I have realized there's four main steps that really help women stand out. First one is all about getting your name out there, because you want people talking about you before sorority recruitment starts. The second step I always take my clients through is mindset, because sorority recruitment is an emotional journey. You immediately get in your head. What happened? Am I not pretty enough? Am I not cool enough? Like, why did these sororities drop me? The third step is the most important one, I believe, is small talk. We figure out your answers to the questions through a formula because there really just is a simple formula. And the last step is optimization strategy, which is just playing the game. Sorority recruitment's a game... You have to know how to play it to keep sororities interested in you. If you're getting an average score, you're not getting invited back.

God... 36 years now, and I got my start at the University of Alabama because of The Machine. ♪ It's a secret society. I believe that the phrase was, "little is known, and what is known is secret." Something very similar to that. So The Machine is the Greek system. They go synonymous, they're hand in hand. It's the exact same thing. They control everything on this campus. So if there's an election, The Machine's rigging it. If there's a Homecoming queen, it's The Machine candidate. You're going to look at awards and different jobs and networks, it's all going to The Machine kids that run their own thing. Even the most trivial things like football seats, it's going to The Machine kids. Every Greek house that's a member of The Machine each have Machine representatives. These representatives form a council that meets in fraternity basements to discuss student politics, and then they report back to their house and their student politicians within those houses and tell them how to vote. You know, I wish that I could say that I had never gotten involved with The Machine in the first place, but like, I did. I really did try to be a good Machine senator, But at the end of the day, something just felt really dark and ugly about it. We slowly make our way over to the Kappa Alpha house, and we go downstairs into the basement, and I kind of peer in and can see this circle of people standing around in this kind of like dingy, smelly fraternity basement. I'm asking myself, "What have I got myself into?" Because I'm like, number one, why are we meeting in a basement? Number two, why are we meeting at, you know, 10:00, 11:00 at night on a Tuesday? What are we hiding? The individual leading the meeting, he was like, "This is just an opportunity for you to see each other's faces. This is, like, the group of people you're going to be working with." Up until that point, I didn't understand that I was essentially going to be a figurehead that was going to do what my Machine rep told me to do. And, you know, every time I did something that she wanted me to do, I always received positive feedback. I always received praise. In that moment, I felt like I was doing something good, but I really wasn't doing anything at all except, you know, being a puppet. I think it's ridiculous that sororities require you to send a screenshot of your voting receipt, right? Others want the e-mail of your voting receipt, like, and if you don't send that in, some sororities fine you. My sorority reacted very negatively to the article, because The Machine is the Greek system. I think it was perceived as me going against my own sisterhood and my own sorority. Only a handful of independent candidates have successfully gone against The Machine and beat them. The university actually had to shut down the Student Government Association from 1993 until 1996 because of The Machine's alleged activities. ♪ The Machine systematically made sure that a minority group on campus of "elite people" who got special treatment, who lived in special homes, who came from the most affluent and powerful families, got an advantage on everyone else. It's a way better teacher of how to do nefarious things for power than you could ever get in a political science class. But I think it's a threat to people's hopes and dreams that they may not be able to fit into the crowd in maybe the tax bracket they want to fit into. I think the danger is not belonging, it's not being one of the chosen people. ♪ [ Singsong voice ] Okay. Little update for you guys. I'm so excited.
