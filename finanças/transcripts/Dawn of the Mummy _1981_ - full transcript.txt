[music playing] -[gasps] -[inaudible] [moaning] [somber music] [chanting] -Osiris! Accept in Paradise this poor Seferaman, who awaits entrance. Don't listen, Osiris, to those who say he was a cruel man. The way of Seferaman is sacred. Hear me, oh Egypt! Should the riches of Seferaman be stolen, all Egypt with tremble. And Seferaman will rise and kill! His armies will rise and kill! It is done. All who know of the burial place of Seferaman must die. You will rise when he rises. You will kill when he kills! He who will enter this tomb after it is sealed will die on the dawn of the mummy! -We did it! -Hey! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! We'll have to wait until tomorrow to go in. The air is poison. It's part of the pharaoh's booby trap to keep out robbers. [laughs] -[scream] I've warned you! You have defiled the tomb of Seferaman! You have ignored the curse! [grunting] -Now I'm warning you. Move on, lady! Beat it! -Mustn't enter! You cannot rob this tomb. It is written. He will rise and kill! He will rise and kill! -That's it, lady! I warned you. [screams] [laughing] -Perhaps what she says is true. Rick, maybe there is a curse! -Eddie! There is no curse. There is poison in the air. It's perfectly scientific. If we go in now, we will die. But the air will be clear by morning. You guard the tomb tonight. I'll be back in the morning. [music playing] -Look over there! It's that crazy woman, Xena! XENA: Please help me! The tomb! No one must enter! The curse will be upon us all! The treasure is sacred. We must close the tomb! -Which tomb, old woman? -Where is it? -The tomb of Seferaman! He will rise and kill! The curse! He will rise and kill! MAN 1: Just tell us where it is. We will guard it for you. -There, over those hills! You'll see! -OK, OK, Xena, we'll take care of it. -That crazy American! You think he really has done it this time? -We'll soon find out. -He's crazy to open the tomb of Seferaman! He must be mad! [groaning] MAN 2: Look!

OK? So long! [music playing] -Perhaps you should wait until we start to do that. -I can't stand it when my toenails are chipped. -Oh, for heaven's sake, Melinda! You're passing the great Pyramids of Cheops! It's a once in a lifetime, and you're worried about your stupid toenails? -So I'm compulsive Jenny! It's my job to look good. -Yeah, but nobody's looking at your feet right now! -You never can tell. JUNE: It's incredible that they built those things thousands of years ago with no modern machinery. Doesn't just blow your mind, Gary? -Just try to keep the jeep from bumping so much. I'm trying to get this joint rolled. -Lisa, just turn slightly, so your hair catches the light! That's right. That's right! No no no, no no! Wait! Wait! -Bill, give me a break! We're not supposed to start working until we get to [inaudible]. So let me be a tourist like everyone else for a little while.
