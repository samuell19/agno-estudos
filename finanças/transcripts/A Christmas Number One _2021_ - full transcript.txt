(CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLING) (HOWLING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) DJ: Good morning, New York City! This is WBLS 107.5 with America's hottest stars. With us in the studio this September morning, we have America's heartthrob, Ranelle Spear. That's you, buddy. Everyone's talking about your new hit, Rather Be Lonely Than Loved By You. Ranelle, it's a super-hot track - tell us about the inspiration behind it. RANELLE: Uh... It's complicated, man. My heart was broken by a girl who turned out to be nothing short of a complete nightmare. You know how it is. London? COLLEEN: Did I come through or what? You'll be in charge of these guys. Hm? Five Together?! Seriously? Don't look so upset, they're the biggest band in Europe. Also, you're gonna have to deal with Grainger, who is an asshole. Great in the sack, but an asshole. (SOFTLY) OK, great. Well, this is goodbye, then... Wait, before you go, just have a look at this new promo shot for Ranelle's new single. It's your last official act on the Ranelle Spear team. What do you think? All right, then. I guess that's why you wanted to leave New York, huh? Mm-hm. Artists, right? (SOFTLY) Yeah. Artists. Fly, my pretty.

An English-German Christmas and excitement levels are high... CARRIE: Nina, don't eat too many - chocolates! - It's my first one! (It's really not.) Check out the tree! All my own work, thank you very much! Cards! Presents! Brazil nuts...that no-one will eat. Ooh. It's pink! How can it be pink? It's had seven hours. (SPEAKS IN GERMAN) Mum! Speak English. I'm Vlogging. My followers don't speak German. What followers? I have followers... Uncle Blake. Kisses for this. Where is he? He's supposed to be helping. And here, hiding in the bushes, we see the male in his natural habitat. It is the height of mating season, and alas, he is alone, for his plumage is not as colourful as the other males... and also he is afraid of commitment. Oh, no, I've forgotten your Christmas present. Hang on, no, I haven't. (WHISTLES, POPS) My God, that's so sweet of you, but I've already got one of those. (WHISTLES, POPS) (PHONE CHIMES) - Who was that? - It's no-one. Ah! Nah, nah, nah, nah. No, no, no. Whoa. Did you just dump someone on Christmas Day?! No. Maybe. Yeah... That is quite bad, isn't it? Yeah! Naughty list for you! I mean, it wasn't serious. No, it never is, is it? That's because all of my love is reserved for you. Boop! Oh, I'm such a lucky girl! Boop! Go on, then, turn the lights on. You turn them on. No, you do it - it's tradition. Besides you're a celebrity, you're in a pop band. Celebrities turn on the lights. First of all, I'm not a celebrity, and it is not a pop band. (RECORDING OF SANTA PLAYS) Woo! I hereby declare the garden Christmas lights are on. Woo. Salmonella or not, we are eating - dinner now! - Joint selfie. Uh... Ah. (SHUTTER CLICKING) That was last Christmas. It was brilliant. I don't think the next one is going to be as much fun. Here you go, boss. - I got you a large. - Good. I can tell you're clearly gonna work out as my new assistant. Thanks! Although... ..Battle of the Bands? Seriously? What were you thinking? I haven't been out in London in three years. So when I said I wanted you to take me out, and take me to some new places, I meant nice places.(CHUCKLES) The last band are supposed to be pretty good. Last band? How many are there? Nine. Jesus. I'll get you another. Thank you. (EMCEE TAPPING MIC) Ladies and gentleman, please welcome to the stage, it's Scurve! ALL: (CHANTING) Kandy, Kandy! WOMAN: Kandy! What the f-Sorry.

People are laughing, Sophie. Yeah, but only... Not the nice ones. There are no nice people in the music industry! I'm nice. Yeah, for now. Give it a few years. Maybe we should just go home? Do you have a... a boyfriend, Sophie? Yeah. Dale. He plays bass in a really cool indie...(GROANS) -..band. - Bass player? Ugh, they're the worst. You watch him. Dale's lovely... Here's some advice. Don't...date...the talent. That's a rule now. Don't...date...the... ..say it, Sophie! Don't date the talent. - Yes! - Yes. Boys in bands are bastards. Could I have another one of these... and whatever she's drinking. Well... that was an absolute shower of shit. Literally - all over us. Would you like a shit shower, sir? Oh? Yes, I would. Do you have a towel? Yes, I do. It's also made of shit. Drums sounded good. Five years. Five years I've given this outfit, and we're still playing crappy venues for peanuts. Battle of the Bands? - You booked it. - Oh... Shut up, Mark. Do you know who I blame? Everyone else? No, no, no. You. You haven't written a good song in ages. I mean, where's the new Yob Boy? Or... Or Crucifixation? You've lost it. Official. I know it's your band and everything, but... if you can't write good songs, then what are you? You're just a bass player. Look, anyone can fucking do that! You can't. You know what, if you don't start pulling your fingers out, I quit. I quit! I mean, I'm the only reason why people come anyway. Actually, I think your girlfriend's the only reason people come. Kandy, I love you. Kandy, please let us get a photo. Oi! Mate! Oi! Yeah, you! Let me buy you both a drink. In a word... why don't you piss off? - Five words. - We're fine, thanks. I'm actually in a relationship. No, you're not. No, no. I mean um... because I spilt yours earlier. W-What happened to your lip? You hit me...with your guitar... in my face. Sorry. Apart from that, uh... what did you think...of the band? OK, if you really want to know... ..I thought...you were shit. (CHUCKLES) Right, well, that's just...that's your opinion, so... Ha. My opinion counts for quite a lot. I happen to be a very big deal in the music business, and I manage a chart-topping act. I... (CHUCKLES) I...am a big fucking success! (LAUGHTER) Woo! MAN: Big success. Thank you. How old are you? Still thinking it's gonna happen? The big dream? It's not going to happen for you, sweetheart. Just accept it. (MEN ARGUE) Boop! Sophie, I think I'm going to throw up now.

I'm sure it would have been um... You seem uh... (GRUNTS, FALLS HEAVILY) Is that sick? Why is there sick here? I don't know. OK. So... do you fancy doing it again...sometime? Not really, no. Fair enough. Good answer. It really smells in here. You should open a window. (GRUNTS) Great. (DOOR CLOSES) Shit! - Meghna Rai?What? - Bobbie Purser, entertainment. The Sun. Oh, yeah, hacked any phones lately? Yeah, yours. So, what about you and Ranelle Spear, eh? Oh, piss off. Come on. What's your favourite album track, is it...is it Quicksand? (BOBBIE CONTINUES TALKING) - Morning. - That guy tries to get in... - kill him. - Will do. (RANELLE SPEAR SONG PLAYS) Turn that off. Somebody's tired. It's jet lag!

No, Lily, you're supposed to sing what I'm singing. 'Row, row, row your boat,' remember? It's a...a round. Around what? Cor, you smell funny! Yeah, well, you look funny. (ALL OOHING) You can't say that! I'm in a wheelchair! Right, um...no. Sorry. Sucker!(LAUGHTER) Yeah, all right. Very funny. Play us one of your songs. (STAMMERS) Ah, really?

Doesn't time fly? See you next week. Bye, Mr Cutter. I shall count down the hours. You have a real gift for this. Honestly, I hate every moment. I'm only doing it for the money... and because my sister made me. How is Carrie? Interfering. And Nina? She's um... She's Nina. MAN: (SINGS) Maximum pleasure. I love Five Together! They are my absolute favourite boy band ever. But who are they, you say? Well, let me explain. This is Nina's 100% guide to the world's greatest boy band - Five... Together! Marcus - intense, street. Voice of an angel. Woo! Jarel - dancer, rapper, dreamboat. Just look at those eyes. D-Wayne - tall. Also rapping...bit bland. There's always one, isn't there? What the F...lex. It's Flex - cute, shy, tattooed - so many tattoos. Dancing - sometimes, with his shirt off... (AS FLEX) Hi, Nina. Would you like to go to Nando's with me? Let me check my diary, Flex. Yes, I will! And finally, K to the E to the V to the I to the N... Kevin - least good name, but best first frontman. Sensitive, soulful... and quite short. Aww. I could put him in my pocket. (AS KEVIN) I would like to go in your pocket, Nina. Kevin, shh. What would Flex say? (KNOCK ON DOOR) CARRIE: Nina, love, it's time to go. OK. Anyway, fun fact - Five Together are managed by a woman, which is why they're so good. I'd love to be her. Her life must be so cool. (GRUNTS) (SIGHS) GRAINGER: Get out, Stuart! Bugger off! Go on, crawl. And keep crawling all the way out of the building and take your rotten signings with you. Hey, Meg. Don't mind Stuart, he's just leaving. Meg Rai, everyone. Back from across - the seas to save us. - Hi. Someone who understands how this business actually works, which is why Meg is now in charge of Five Together, who, God bless their shiny little faces, are the only UK act keeping Mr Wolf from our very expensive front door. Or at least they were. Why does she get Five Together? What happened to Steve? Steve's gone. Steve's dead. Nobody mention Steve again. Steve thought it would be a good idea to let one of the boys in the band write half the songs on the new album. - Oh, yeah, Kevin. - Yeah. Yeah, I saw those numbers. They're not tracking too well. Don't try to polish it, Meg. - It's a turd. You can't. - Yeah, maybe you should try sleeping with Kevin? Then, he might write better tunes. (LAUGHS) Excuse me? Worked for Ranelle Spear. (LAUGHTER) You know what? You're both sacked too! BOTH: What? Get out. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, you don't have to crawl. Stuart crawls! You two can hop. Like little rabbits! Go on, hop! Go on!(GROANS) Sorry about that. That was uncalled for. Would it work, though, you sleeping with the singer? That is not a serious question, - is it? - No. Maybe. No. You know what they're calling us? Cock-it-up-smiths. I'd be laughing if I wasn't constantly trying to talk my accountant down off - a ledge.It's that bad? - Worse. You know how it works. I like the boys. Chris and uh... Kevin. Kevin and the others. But if we can't turn it around, they're gone. It's panto, Celebrity Big Brother and rehab for them. And if they're gone, then so are you. (CHUCKLES) I just got here. So you have to turn it around. OK. How? Glad you asked. A Christmas song. (ANGELIC MUSIC) A big, stonking Yuletide number one. (MUSIC STOPS) - Yeah? - I don't get it. (ANGELIC MUSIC) A Christmas number one! (MUSIC STOPS) Really? Is that even a thing any more? Yes. Look, Five Together are our only cash cow. And I intend to squeeze every drop of money out of their tightly honed little udders before I send them to knacker's yard. ('SILENT NIGHT' PLAYS) I will not be poor, Meg, I will not. A Christmas song - a number one. October is looming. So, you've got a month to find something fabulous and get it recorded. Hey, no pressure, but I will sack you if you fail. (MUSIC ENDS ABRUPTLY) I-I just feel like one of those mime artists, who do that thing where they walk into the wind. Except the wind is real. And I'm walking and I'm walking, and I'm not getting anywhere. And no-one's putting money in my hat. The band's going nowhere. I'm never gonna make it. (SIGHS) It's too late for me... You're only 34. Exactly, too late. Well, I think I may have said this before... No, I definitely have. If it's making you unhappy... (TOY SQUEAKING) Quit...the...band. Ow! I've got a hangover! There's a surprise. Fine. Say I do quit the band. What then? Figure it out, I guess. You're the adult...allegedly. Don't get me wrong. I love the music. - Because you're weird. - Extreme metal is a valid musical art form. - For weirdos. - I can write - other songs... I have been. - And? (SINGS) ..in Satan's garden. No. What? I don't know why I'm talking to you about this. You don't know anything about music. You're half-German.(GASPS) Beethoven? Mm. Kraftwerk? Hmm. Er... You've run out, haven't you? Shut up. At least the bands I like are successful and make people happy. What, like Five Together? Wow, so mature. - Well, I am only 34. - Anyway, you have to talk to me because I've decided - you are my new project. - And what if I don't want to be your project? I'm afraid that's not up to you. Why not? NURSE: Sorry to interrupt - medicine time. Why do you think, doofoid? No. And your first task as my new project... is to write a song... ..for me. OK. Go on, then. Crack on. (WHIMPERING) They're saying it got worse. They're going to try some different treatments. Right. OK, well...that's good. That's good, right? There must be something they... They're saying it's months, maybe weeks. She might not even make it till Christmas. (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (SCREAMS) (DOG BARKS) Oh, God, here he is. Late again. We've been rehearsing for, like, two hours, man... Christ, Blake, you look like my Uncle Gunther when I found him four days after he died. - Ugh. - Yeah, for sure. I mean, the cats had been at his face. It was not good. That is what you look like. You all right, mate? This is called God Killer. ♪ God killer! God killer! ♪ How can you destroy the young and crush their precious toys? ♪ God killer! God killer! ♪ I hate you for the way that you burn everything I love ♪ Enough ♪ Persecution...pointless death! ♪ ('GOD KILLER' PLAYS ON DEVICE) ♪ Yeah, oh, God killer ♪ - So, what do you think? - Can you please not do that again? There are sick children on this ward. Sorry. I was just playing Nina - her song. - It was horrible. THAT was my song? Well, yeah. Oh.24 Scurve fans in Denmark gave it the thumbs up. Did you like it? Not really. Was it supposed to cheer me up? Because it didn't. - How could it? It was awful. - I mean, it's not Ranelle Spear, is it? - I like him. - I thought - it was pretty lit. - Thanks, mate. Bit derivative, though. Kind of early Slayer. Yeah, all right. Arsehole. I thought you were going to write - different songs. - I know, but... 'Oh, Nina, I wish I could challenge myself musically more.' 'Oh, Nina, I've have much more to give as a songwriter.' 'Oh, Nina.' I don't sound like that. - Do I? - Yeah. I am... writing different songs, but the band - doesn't want to...do them. - So what? What do you want to do? Look, I want to be a vet, but I don't think that's going to happen. So, whatever it is, you need to get on with it. I know. I will. Good. So write me a nice song, you twat. (CHUCKLES) All right! You gonna let her talk to me like that? Yes. You are a bit of a twat. OK. Uh... Fine. What do you want the song to be about? (TOY SQUEAKING) Uh... Unicorns? Ow! OK. Not unicorns. What, then? (SIGHS) Write me a Christmas song. Really? Yeah. OK. Deal. (SINGS) It's on its way, it's nearly here. That very special time of the year - it's C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S... Christmas! Nope. (SINGS) Everybody's dancing at the Christmas party! No. (SIGHS) (SINGS) It's a reggae, reggae Christmas! Rice and peace. Rice and peace! Is he joking? Is that a joke? ..with my papa's jerk turkey. Oh, Lord! No, no, no, no, no! (SINGS) We can build a snowman out of lo-o-o-ove... No. We can't. If you shake those, I'm gonna shove 'em right up your -OK, then! Thank you so much for coming, great stuff, just great stuff. But I didn't get a chance to play you my song. No, no, I know, love, but I have this really good feeling... We'll be in touch, thank you. Hey. You could always ask Ranelle. He might have a song for us. - No. - I'll bet you've still got his number, though, haven't ya? You really are an arsehole, aren't you? Yes, I'm an arsehole... who pays your wages. At least I do at the minute. So uh...tick-tock. MAN: (SINGS) Maximum pleasure. (MEN ARGUING) KEVIN: It should be me at the front, surely. PHOTOGRAPHER: Together! Guys, we've got a whole calendar to shoot, we've only done December - - can we please get a move on! - Meg. New girl. Talk to me. What's happening? Are Cocksmiths gonna drop us? What? No. Flex... will you stop doing push-ups! (LAUGHS) Don't bullshit me, Meg. We really need to get a move on. - We're only booked till six. - I know! Jesus. One hit album and look at them. I should have stayed in New York. I'm not wearing this...or this... Show me. ..or this. Look, we're not idiots. We know the new album's - not selling well. - That's not true. It's doing well in Belgium. What's Belgium? They're going to drop us, aren't they?(CHEERING) Flex, what are you doing? Showing Sophie my tattoos. Check out my latest one. JAREL: Flex! (WHOOPING) Idiot! - That must've stung. - Right! Will everyone just shut up, and stand in front of the photographer for two minutes, please? Meg, why am I dressed as an elf and Marcus is Santa? Cos it... looks like he's more important. Which he's obviously not... I'm not gonna take this. (WHIMPERS) (SCREAMS) Also, where's our Christmas song? I'm working on it. Because I could write the arse off that. The thing is...some people, not me, thought the songs on the last album were a little... (HUMS) Those songs were hits. The producer just... produced them wrong! (LIFT BELL DINGS) Maybe. Maybe. Um... I just... I need to go out for a think. Please, Meg, just give me a chance. (LIFT BELL DINGS) I'll nail that song. I'll nail it to the cross! RANELLE: Hey, babe. Ranelle? What are you doing here? Yeah, I know - awkward, right? PR tour for the album. God, man, Brits, they just...they love themself a piece of Ranelle. Hey, you going up? Going down. Now, that sounds good. Wow. Old times' sake. You know, I could just press the emergency stop button. (LIFT BELL DINGS) (CLANKING) Do you actually think I'm gonna have sex with you, in this lift, now? I mean, yeah. Maybe she can get involved too. What is wrong with you and your penis? I'm sorry, you do realise his latest album was all about our relationship? Yeah, he called it It's Not Me, It's You. Babe, I am an artist, OK? I have to draw on my reality. Track one - Lose That Girl. Track two - Got To Be Free. Track three - I Wish She Didn't Love Me So Much. Track four - Rather Be Lonely Than Loved By You. Track five - Quicksand. (VOCALISES) Quicksand. God, I love that track! It's bullshit. The way I remember it, IE the facts, is that you said you loved me while sleeping with as many women as you possibly could. Look at it this way, I have immortalised you. (LIFT BELL DINGS) And now, you will go on to live forever through my music. Oh, it's interesting. Your music doesn't cover you breaking up with me by text while screwing my best friend. I notice you didn't write a song about that. Why were you such a dick to me? (SCOFFS) Can I refer you to the bonus live track on the deluxe edition - Ordinary Sex. (LIFT BELL DINGS) Oh, I can't believe I'm doing this... (LIFT BELL DINGS) I don't suppose you've written any Christmas... (LIFT BELL DINGS) Really?! A...Christmas... song. NINA: So, what makes a great Christmas pop song? Having some time on my hands, I've been doing some research. Did you know that we reached 'peak Christmas song' in the 1970s, and there have been fewer Christmas hits every decade since then? What's wrong with people? Why aren't the jingle bells rocking? Isn't Santa Claus coming to town? Don't they know it's Christmas? Come on, everyone. It's not that hard. This is what you need to make a perfect Christmas pop song. One - snow, obviously! (SINGS) Snow is falling on my head... I should have worn a... ..hat? Two - Santa...or Jesus. But never both, that's just confusing. (CROONS) Hey, Santa! What's going on? Three - the word 'Christmas' somewhere in the lyrics. This is a dealbreaker. Otherwise, it's just a song and not a Christmas song. Duh! (SINGS AGGRESSIVELY) (CLATTERING) Four! Hope...for love. Hope for peace. Hope for the future... (HIGH-PITCHED) I'm the candy-coloured pixie with my happy pixie sleigh! (YELLS) Funf, funf, funf! Finally, a bittersweet quality, evoking a wistfulness for happier times, the innocence of Christmases past. Bittersweet. (GROANS) (LAUGHS) (WITH REVERB) Sweet. Five things, of which you need at least four to make your Christmas song a hit. Let's put it to the test. Favourite Christmas song? Ooh... Last Christmas? Good! Use of word the 'Christmas'. Hope for love... massively bittersweet, and snow - well, snow in the video. I Wish It Could Be Christmas - Every Day. - Wizzard. Full house. and bonus - children's cho-o-o-oir. Classic. Um... Christmas Night Of The Zombies by MXPX. OK...don't know that one. Oh, it's really cool. It mentions Christmas. There's snow, although it is covered in blood. Also a bittersweet quality, harking back to a time before the zombies. (GROWLING EFFECT) - And hope? - Yeah. Hope you don't get - killed by the zombies. - Great. There you have it. You don't need two drunk tramps in New York having a row...(BOXING BELL EFFECT) ..just these five things, and you'll soon have everyone a-rocking around the Christmas tree. So what are you waiting for? Christmas? Well? That's more like it. Are you sure it's not too... It's beautiful. And four of the five things. Five things? Better not be any swearing in it. I'm glad you like it. Yeah. (FOOTSTEPS) Please tell me this is a good one. Who are they, and where are they? What do you mean, 'is it good?' Surely you've heard it? Course I haven't heard it. Why do you think I'm here? You emailed me. You said you found a brilliant song. No, you emailed me. What?! (DOOR OPENS) Huh?

OK, but... there's a girl who's made a vlog about what makes a great Christmas song. It's very funny. I'm not in a laughing mood. She's also posted a... a pretty good original song. It's by her uncle. NINA: (ON LAPTOP) It is brilliant... although, he can be a dick sometimes. Plus, he really needs a girlfriend. (KISSING SOUNDS) So, if there's anyone out there... check this out. (SONG BEGINS) Yes! Bang! Good! Excellent! Finally! Did the kid compose it? Because we could probably screw her on rights. No, her uncle. Ah, who is he? - No idea. - Then what are you still doing here, talking to me? We need that song. Go find him now! Hey! And don't sleep with him... unless you have to. WOMAN: Hurry up, then, innit! (MAN YELLING) (POUNDING MUSIC PLAYS IN DISTANCE) (MUFFLED SINGING) (DROWNED OUT BY MUSIC) (SINGS) Taste the metal in my mouth... (YELLS) Hello! Love, love. We're in the middle of a rehearsal here, yeah? Yeah, sorry, I'm uh... I'm looking -I know you. Hmm... No, I-I don't think so. Yeah... I hit you in the face, you...crushed my soul, pissed on my dreams and vomited on my shoes. It was a Wednesday, I think. (LAUGHTER) Battle of the Bands? (SOFTLY) Oh, God. Hey, good to see you. How are you? Still a big success? Did you get the sick - out of your hair? - Yes, I did. Thank you for asking. Obviously got the wrong room. - Mm-hm. - Do carry on with uh...whatever that was. Right, one, two... I...um... I don't suppose any of you know - a Blake Cutter, do you? - Yep. That's me. Hilarious. Seriously, I'm in a bit of a rush. Do any of you know Blake Cutter? O...K! Fabulous! I mean, it's great to meet you, finally, Mr Cutter. May I call you Blake? Look, I...I work for Cocksmiths Management, and we're... very, very excited about your song. God Killer? Right. Well, yes, I'm Ryan. I am...oop... the...very much the lead singer. What's God Killer? That sounds horrible. No. I'm talking about your Christmas song. Aw, you wrote a Christmas song? Why? How do you know about that? Your niece posted it online. It really is very good. You know... not like all this thrashy stuff. Thrashy stuff?! Anyway. Great news! Five Together want to record your song! Five Together! (SNIGGERING, LAUGHTER) Yeah, I know. It's um... It's amazing, right? Um... What do you think? Well. I...I mean, it's a lot to take in. I know, it's exciting. And you came all the way down here to ask me? Yes, yes, of course I did - I tracked you down! Like a little terrier. Ruff! Yes! No, I-I mean... Christmas is coming, and you know, my job's riding on it. - Is it? - Little bit. Not interested. One, two, three, four! Look, I know we haven't gotten off to the best of starts, but could you please hear me out? This is a major recording act we're talking about who really want to do your song justice. Five Together are shit. Aye. Fair enough. Maybe you could park your hatred of the band for just one moment... I also hate the venal, soulless, dead-eyed, corporate world they represent, which means you. Right. OK, but maybe we could park that too. You do understand that we're talking about a serious amount of money? I don't care about the money. That was a personal song for Nina, and I won't have it pissed all over by a bunch of Brit-school, talent-show song-puppets and their corporate shill-handler. Hey! You don't know anything about me! Good. Let's keep it that way. Van. What?! (HORN HONKS)(SCREAMS) (WHIMPERS) NINA: (ON TABLET) It is brilliant, although he can be a dick sometimes. Plus he really needs a girlfriend. (KISSING SOUNDS) Yeah, good luck with that. So, if there's anyone out there... check this out. (SONG BEGINS) Hm. Hmm. ♪ Maximum pleasure, and see the love in me ♪ Back off the pressure, and feel the energy ♪ Moments to treasure - let's make some memories ♪ You're not gonna make it alone ♪ What the shit?! Blake! Oh, my God, what did you do?! Thank you! NINA: Oi, you! Why didn't you tell me Five Together want to record your song? Well, I...was going to...obviously. But it looks like somebody beat me to it. Please make them stop singing. I have a life-threatening condition. Can I have a word with you...outside? Yeah, sure. Good job. Unbelievable! Of all the disgusting, slimy, underhand things to do - using a sick girl to get a song for your crappy band! (STAMMERS) I mean, you are... Argh! OK, I haven't got the time for you to find the right adjective. (SOFTLY) I need the song. And Nina's a massive Five Together fan. I mean, you should be thanking me. I'm making you look good. (LAUGHS) Look how happy she is. You don't care about her. That would involve you having a heart, instead of a um... a shrivelled-up husk of... ..diseased muscle that can only beat when it makes money or exploits children... which is what you have! I'm having that song. Never gonna happen. There he is, my uncle...the genius. Look, um... Sorry, could we... could we get a little room? (LAUGHS) You don't really want these guys to record the song, do you? I mean, it was just for you - sort of...personal. Yes, and now Five Together want to record it! Yeah...but...but is it... is it a Five Together song? It is now. Besides... you wrote it for me, so technically, it's mine. Yeah... And anyway, you said you wanted to write different songs - now you have the biggest band in the country wants to record one of them. What's wrong with you? Are you an idiot? Fine. You can have the song. (EXCITED CHATTER) Yes... Yeah! Thank you. No, I mean, thank you. But I have one proviso. What's a proviso? All the money goes to a cancer charity. - I'm sorry, excuse me? - What's that? No disrespect - that's ridiculous. Cancer? Sure. Good. I also have one proviso. O...K. My uncle gets to produce the record. Well, I mean... Yeah, I'm not sure... (MUTTERING) (SINGSONGY) I've got terminal cancer. Sure, no problem. - Yeah. - OK! Good. So, we start on Monday. Will you be at the recordings? Mm-hm. I will be - why? No reason. ACCOUNTANT: (OVER PHONE) Whatever way we look at it, we're gonna need to get something that's gonna keep us afloat. It's a serious situation, Grainger. We're going to need more money. Yes, I'm aware that we need a cash injection! There must be something you can do! 'I've given you every idea!' You're the accountant! 'I know that, I'm trying to help. You do have a huge chateau in France.'No. I'm not selling the house in France. 'OK, listen...' And that yacht has sentimental value!'Yes, OK.' Bono gave me that yacht!'Yes, OK, listen. Let me see -' (PHONE RINGS) Hang on a minute.'Let me see if there's some more loopholes.' What? (OVER PHONE) It's ours. You got it? 'Yep!' Brilliant, Meg.'But he wants all the money to go to charity.' He wants all the money to go to charity? Hang on a minute. (HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING)(GRUNTS) 'Grainger?' (GRUNTING) 'Grainger.' (POPPING) (WHISTLING STOPS) Sure, no problem, love. Whatever it takes. 'I heard that!' All right.'I heard that. Grainger, I heard that! I did! I heard it! If it goes to charity, we're all doomed!'Don't panic. 'Grainger...' You're seriously choosing Five Together over Scurve? Our tour starts in two days! Yeah. You sell us up the river, I think, hmm? Why don't you just bend over and let the Man give it to you with his big corporate money schlong! OK, well, thanks for being so understanding. Guys, he's doing it for Nina. Is he, Mark? Is he? Or does he just wanna... Ooh! Go hang out with Simon Cowell? Go water-skiing on Necker Island with bloody... ..Dua Lipo? Like you said... anyone can play the bass. Not like you. Oh, don't cry, Mark. Don't cry, mate. Don't worry, we'll find someone. We'll find someone who's committed. Not like Mr Sellout over here. Whatever. Enjoy the tour. Thank you. Yeah, we will, mate! It'll be the best bloody tour yet cos you're not in it! All right, and when you're done with all your little jingly bells, yeah, don't bother coming back! Bass players, man! Yeah. Don't think I will. (DOOR CLOSES) MAN: (SINGS) Maximum pleasure. NINA: What's that sound? Only my uncle's brilliant Christmas song being recorded! Exciting! (CHEERING EFFECT) What say we check out the studio and meet the players? Best boy band in the world - check. ALL: (VOCALISING) Hello... Nina! Nice! Oh, my God! Actual gold discs! And knobs. Lady who knows what the knobs do. It's Michaela. Michaela! This arrangement is all wrong. It needs to be simple. No, Five Together are an urban act... These two... bickering like an old married couple. Creative tension! Dare I say chemistry? - Are you gonna film everything? - Yes. Flex, do your abs again! (CUCKOO EFFECT) (STAMMERS) OK, that is inappropriate! Come on, just sit down. You're going to knacker yourself out. Right, do you want a drink or something? Are you warm enough? I'm fine. Stop fussing. He's so caring. Single too. Yeah, all right, that's enough about me. At least eat something... MARCUS: (SINGING) Mi mi mi mi mi mi... (VOCALISES) Christmas lights... What's that? He's just warming up. As long as he doesn't sing the song that way. (MUSIC STARTS) (SINGS) Christmas lights, Christmas morning. (VOCALISES DRAMATICALLY) Unique snowflakes slowly falling... (STAMMERS) Uh... Marcus? What? I've just started. (STAMMERS) Yeah, I'm uh... I'm not sure I wrote quite so many notes in the... the first four words. This is better. What I'm doing's better. It's great, Marcus. Thanks, sweetheart. Uh... Could we just try it simpler... you know, as written? Absolutely! You're the producer. (CLEARS THROAT) (VOCALISES DRAMATICALLY) Christmas lights, Christmas morning. Welcome to my world. (VOCALISES) ..falling... No. (VOCALISES) No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Huh? (SINGS) ..mas lights. No, no, no. (LAUGHS) (KNOCKING ON GLASS) I don't want to go. You mustn't tire yourself out. Why not? (SIGHS) Well...what was...all that... ..incredibly unsubtle matchmaking earlier? I have no idea what you're talking about. Because that is not a thing that's happening. She's really nice. Hmm, is she? Yeah! She's pretty, she's successful... I bet she's well rich. (SIGHS) Are you intimidated by powerful women? Can we just drop it? (CHUCKLES) Come on. I bet you like her a little bit, don't you? I know you do. Honestly... I'd rather eat broken glass. I'd rather listen to Five Together's debut album on a constant loop forever. I'd rather insert this entire mic stand up my bum... ..than be romantically involved with that woman. (GRUNTS) Methinks he doth protest too much. (FEEDBACK) Just so you know, the mic is actually still on, so... Yeah, just... (CHUCKLES) Sorry. ALL: (SINGING) Winter winds are blowing... It's going well. Yeah. - We should be fine. - Will you share every Christmas... Stop. Stop, stop. Sorry, sorry. (MUSIC STOPS) Um... No, no, no, no, no, no. Why do you keep interrupting? What was that? We don't need that. - BVs, man. - Well, it sounded good to me. I think we've got it. Yeah? No, no, we don't. Um... Could we all just sing the same line as Marcus, but in harmony? Thank you. Uh... Yeah, no. That's my line. I'm the lead singer. Well, I mean, that's not... We're both kind of the lead. Yeah, no, sure. Yeah. We're both... (I'm the actual lead singer.) Sorry, what was that? I mean, I sing lead sometimes. You sang on one track on - the first album. - Very much filler! You got that last take, didn't you? Yeah, yeah - it's in the bank. (CLEARS THROAT) OK, everybody, let's just try one Blake's way. He is the producer, after all. Thank you. MARCUS: Such bullshit. ♪ Ours was a burning love ♪ Which I vividly... BOTH: ..remember ♪ That time in my crib back in mid.....December ♪ You rode to mine on your brother's motor.....cycle ♪ And I sang to you like I was channelling George.....Michael ♪ And now when I hear the sound of ringing sleigh.....bells ♪ Hot nuts, yes ♪ You remember how they smell ♪ Can I get you anything? (GASPS) (SIGHS) A gun? - Sing it like it's written! - Have you had a platinum-selling album? Sing it like it's written! Who even are you...even? They're singing the wrong words. No, we're singing better ones because we're artists. That's the process. We're all professionals here...unlike you. Do you have any idea what you're actually singing about? What this song means? Because... Because I do. Because I wrote it. And you're just fucking it up! OK, OK, let's just take a break. And you're not even the best singer. He is! Thanks, man. Not you. Him. Yes! All killer no filler! Did he just say I'm not the best singer? OK, let's definitely take - a break now. - With pleasure. (DOOR OPENS, SLAMS) (SIGHS) Hmm? We'd like a word...in private. (SCOFFS) Oh, uh... (STAMMERS) I'm sorry, are you trying to intimidate me? Cos uh... I should point out that you're a boy band... and therefore, not very intimid- (YELLS) (DUCT TAPE TEARING) Look, this song. Now, I get that you're all... emotionally involved in it and stuff. But it's our song now, so stop being a dick, and let us do it our way. Because we're gonna do it anyway. So, why bother fighting it, yeah? Exactly, co-operation. Think about Nina. She's excited about this, yeah? And you want her to be happy, don't you? So, now, we're gonna go back downstairs, you're gonna keep your mouth shut... and leave it to the big boys. Or else...show him, D-Wayne. (THUDDING, CAR ALARM WAILS) Sorry, man! MEG: What the hell do you think you're doing?!(MAN YELLING) - Get back downstairs now! - You know you're not actually our boss, Meg, so you can't tell us what to do. Now. Little shits! (MUMBLING) OK? Ow! (CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. There's nothing like being tortured by a Poundland One Direction! You know what, I'm done. Yeah, I'm gonna get a drink, and I'm gonna listen to some real music. You produce the song. I already am. You really didn't think I was gonna leave this up to you, did you? This was supposed to be a special thing between me and Nina. And then you came along, and...and you ruined it just so you could save your job. Well, congratulations, you have. And I hope you go on to make many more wonderful records with such inspiring artists! I hope you're very proud of yourself. (DOOR CLOSES) (PHONE RINGS) Hello? NINA: (OVER PHONE) Hi, it's Nina. How's it going? Er... How did you get this number? 'Uh... Yeah, I might have nicked it off Blake's phone. Yeah, I was trying to get hold of him, but he's not answering.' He's just um...talking to the boys. 'Really? Cos it says on my Snap he's in the Black Door Club round the corner from you.' Yes, that's right. He was just talking to the boys, and now he stepped out to get some... (MOUTHING) ..sandwiches and... (MOUTHING) ..falafel... for the boys. 'I miss the boys. Tell them I miss them.' Will do. 'And thank you for this - for, you know, choosing his song... for letting him produce it. I think it might be just what he needs. Can't wait to hear it! Bye!' Bye.(DISCONNECT TONE) (SIGHS) I'm a terrible person, aren't I? (SOFTLY) Yep. OK, boys. Shall we go again? (MUFFLED MUSIC, SHOUTING) Hey. Tracked you down again. This place is still horrible. Mind if I join? Sure, feel free. Compound my misery. We finished the recording - just the mix to do. How did the rap come out? We cut the rap. I'm not a complete moron. You're a complete something. OK... I admit...bringing the boys to the hospital was a shitty move. - Yeah, it was. - Well, it isn't the first shitty move I've pulled, and it probably won't be the last. I work in the music industry. I just hope Nina likes it. That's all that matters. She'll love it...because it's a brilliant song, and... you should feel so proud. You've done a good thing, and you're a good uncle. EMCEE: Put your hands together, everybody. (CHEERING) It's the band you've been waiting for. It's Cholera! (FEEDBACK) (HEAVY DRUMMING) What? (POUNDING METAL MUSIC) (INDISTINCT SINGING) (ROARS) Welcome to my world! You're joking, right? I'm not - going in there! - Yes, you are. Then we're quits for what you did at the hospital. OK? Come on, it'll be fun! Come on. (SCREAMS) (AGGRESSIVE VOCALS) (LAUGHS) Seriously, these are all about you? All of them. Quicksand?! Ooh, I've gotta hear that one. Oh! No, it's not funny! Sorry...no. It is quite funny, though. And to think... I gave him his first break. Yeah, well, I hate him. Not as much as I hate him. I went round to his apartment one morning, thought I'd surprise him with breakfast, and my best friend Amy opens the door half-naked. Wow. Now I really hate him. Plus, I've always thought that when he sings, he...he sounds a bit like a strangled otter. He does sound like a strangled otter.(LAUGHS) Thank you! (MIMICS RANELLE) I would rather be lonely... BOTH: ..than loved by you. (LAUGHTER) (MOCKINGLY) ..than loved by you. (LAUGHS) That is a good impression of him. And a strangled meerkat... both of them.(LAUGHS) So that would make you...35? Close enough. First song you ever bought? Ooh. Hit Me Baby One More Time. Ah, it's pop gold. Uh... Your favourite album? Too hard. I'd have to give you at least three, and they change on a daily basis. (CHUCKLES) Maybe someday, I will like your thrashy metal-stuff thingy too. No, I'm joking... of course I never will. Yeah, you will. Ah, living in a dream world. (LAUGHS) Well, this is me. Uh... Well...thank you. Yeah, well, I actually live nearby. Yeah, you know where that murder was the other week? And then I think they busted that crack den. Yeah. Just round from there. Nice place. Up and coming. (CHUCKLES) Yes. Well... ..good night. Night. (CHUCKLES) OK...I'm not gonna kiss you. I have this new rule - no dating artists. No, no, no. Obviously. Sensible. Mm. Yeah, I'm actually working on a new rule myself. Um... No more meaningless one-night stands. - Mm. - Not that that's what this would have uh... (CHUCKLES) Yeah... let's just keep things professional. Exactly. Definitely. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) (BIRDS TWEETING) (SOFTLY) Oh, no. (MUSIC AND TWEETING CONTINUES) (SCREAMS) (MUSIC STOPS) (GROANS, THUDS) Good morning! Dammit. Sorry...um... forgot you were there. Are you OK? (MUFFLED) Fine. Fine. (THUDS) MAN: Morning. Hurry up! You're late! I'm coming! I'm coming! OK, OK, OK. Um... Before we go in... let's be clear, last night was a mistake. Yeah, absolutely. Uh... You're really fit. - No! - No, no, no. I mean all the running and uh... Well, but that too... Professional. Exactly. Definitely. (GASPS) MAN: Standing by! Oh! - Hey! - Hi, Carrie. CARRIE: Hello. Hi, Nina. So, you're late...together. Wait. Two...together? (BOTH MUMBLE NERVOUSLY) We just take the same...bus. -..train. - Train. Um... Shut up? I wanna go in the middle. You're not getting in the middle. (ARGUMENT CONTINUES) - Sorry, I just... Yeah. - Boys? - So, how's it going?Brilliant! - We get to watch through the monitors. Ooh, great.

I didn't know anything about the money. And I've actually quit my job. Now, he can't get the song back, not without stumping up a huge amount of money to cover Cocksmiths' costs... but he can record a version of his own, and I can help him release it. It's a good story, and with the right kind of publicity, it could sell, and that money will go to charity. It's the least I could do. Ja, you said it. So...will you tell him? Ja, I tell him. I'm not stupid. No...but I clearly am. OK, goodbye, corporate lady bitch. Hey! MARK: Hey, man. You all right? - Thanks for coming. - Always. - How you doing? - Good. Hey.

(LAUGHS) I-I can't think...of anything. How about a concept album about an arrogant, heartless arsehole? Oh...yes! You've got ideas, Meg! You're my muse. You are my muse! Come and be my muse again, huh? Look, the record label are seriously on my back. What do you say? Say yes. Yes. Come on, just say yes. Say it. Say it. Ranelle. Yeah? I'd rather be lonely than be loved by you. OK. So...what does that mean? It's your own... Never mind. I have to be somewhere. And finally, a real David and Goliath story. Chart-topping boy band Five Together go head-to-head with obscure grindcore metal band Scurve in a race for the Christmas number-one spot with the same song. Blake Cutter of Scurve, who wrote the song, decided to release his band's own version when he discovered that the money from the Five Together single was not, in fact, going to charity. (CLAMOURING) Look, look. No, look, look. This has been grossly misrepresented. Of course, some of the money will be going to a designated charity. What am I, a monster? Now, get out of my way. JOE LYCETT: (ON RADIO) Welcome to the nation's most exciting Christmas countdown with me, the nation's most exciting DJ, Joe Lycett. This is where we find out who is going to take hold of that always-cherished position, the number-one song spot on Christmas Day. We've all been asking the question - will it be the world's favourite boy band Five Together, or could it be those not so well-known purveyors of grindcore Scurve? Hi. Just went up to see Nina. You're not sticking around for the...countdown, then? No. I have to go. Oh. Back to Ranelle Spear. What? Yeah, I called you. He answered. Said you'd just had sex. And you believed him? Do you really think that would be something I would do? Er... He tried to sleaze his way back to me, and I told him where to get off. Oh. So... Why do you even care? You're with Kandy now. What? No. Wh-What?! ONLOOKERS: Oh, no. Terrible. I'm not! Well, she answered the door to me, half-naked. You were getting her breakfast. You'd both been up all night and were so hungry! No. no. That was just... She was upset. Yeah. I thought you were different. Clearly, I was wrong. No! No. She'd just broken up with Ryan. She's always walking around half-naked! She's German. (MUTTERING) Do you know what? Doesn't really matter. I'm... I'm going back to New York. A friend of mine is setting up a new label and offered me a job, and I've taken it, so um... New York? Oh, but I thought that maybe we... What? I told you. I don't date artists. You should go up and see Nina. Meg! (SIGHS) Shit! RADIO: All right, folks. It's nearly time to reveal who's gonna be Christmas number one. Where've you been? Sorry, sorry, sorry. He's my boyfriend. OK. (CHUCKLES) Meg was here. I know. I saw her. And? Did you tell her how you feel? Yeah. Yeah, I did. And? (CHUCKLES) I knew I was right about you two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you called it. RADIO: So the question on everyone's lips, have Five Together scored the number one, or did Scurve achieve the improbable? With two new entries to reveal, the nation's Christmas top ten looks and sounds something like this. At ten, Coldplay with Indigo Snow. At nine, Olly Murs with Bang, There Goes My Heart. At eight, Justin Bieber with God Complex. At seven, Ed Sheeran with Unnecessary Boyfriend. Sixth, Unbreakable, it's Dua Lipa. At five, it's the Little Drummer Boy... Come on, lads! ..Little Mix and Snoop Dogg. Number four, the cast of Gogglebox with The Sun Always Shines On TV. At three, Ranelle Spear - Goodbye, Baby. So here we are - two records left, and I can reveal they are both the same song. Come on. Come on. Who's it gonna be? This year's Christmas number one is... ..Five Together! (CHEERING) I'm sorry. What for? They beat us. All I wanted was a nice Christmas song. You wrote me a hit. You got the first spot and the second! Don't you realise how amazing that is? They were always going to beat us. What were you hoping for? A miracle?
