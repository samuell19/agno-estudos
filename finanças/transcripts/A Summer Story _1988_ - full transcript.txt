A love story Based on the book "The Apple Tree" Summer of 1922. My wife and I were on holiday in Dartmoor. For me it was a Secret pilgrimage. Shan't be long, have a nice walk dear. Get the picnic ready. It was like everything was waiting my return. What did I hope to find After all these years? Happy memories? Or some sort of forgiveness? As I hesitated, torn between fear and longing. The memories began to live again. My dear Frank, what you know about women in you head doesn't exist. What is this love you talk about anyway? Where is this feeling I want to know, I'll tell you, that's where it gets you. Not in the head nor in the heart but right between the legs. - It sounds uncomfortable. - Look, Wake up, man! You remember that girl in the Tobacconist? The one on the back of Bayliss? No. What a body! By jove, what a body! It took me four weeks and about 10 kg of tobacco to get in a hump. But by God it was worth it! Hand over the map, would you. - What's her name by the way? - Who's name? The girl in the tobacconist hall? I dont know. Elsie, Betty, Joan. What the devil does it matter what their name was? There should be a footpath to Widicombe somewhere around here. Anyway, a rose by any other name and all that. Yes here we are, We take that track across the field. Well, let's get going. I thought you would have known your Shakespeare. - Come on then I dare you. - Dosen't it open? A pint of best at the next inn we come to. Not the cleanest vault. But you got over it. What do you say making it a pint. Okay. Come on boy don't just sit there. I say, are you all right? Damned ankle. I twisted it somehow. Let's take a look. No, it's not broken. - A slight sprain Maybe. - Bloody silly thing to do. You sit here. I'll scout around a bit. There must be a farm somewhere near-by. We haven't passed one for ten miles. Oh! Look there's a girl Perhaps she can help. Hello there. You Miss! Is there a farm round here? Somewhere we can stay? My friend's hurt his leg. Do you live nearby? Can you put us up for the night? Splendid! We were hoping to get to Widdicombe. But he can't walk I'm afraid. Bit of luck, old chap! This young lady says her aunt will put us up for the night. It's not far. Do you think you can manage it? Yes, yes, i'm sure I can. Not far now. See how she walks? Beautiful. This might be quite interesting. - What the devil did you mean by that? Oh! a little game in the hay loft. After a slice of aunties pie and a flagon of cider. How about you, Alright? For God's sake, she probably can't even spell mer own name. What the devil does that matter? Miss! - What's your name, girl? - Megan David, sir. I'm Mr. Garson. This is Mr. Ashton. I'm a doctor. Mr. Ashton's a poet. Yes sir. Maybe that's why he can't jump gates. Yes sir. I'll tell you what my aunt says. Thank you Miss David. Thank you Miss David. Why the hell did you say I'm a poet? - Does your ankle hurt? - Like hell if you want to know. Auntie! Auntie! She's cute, rather pretty. - Hey, who are they Joe! - Yeah, Who are they? I don't know. Strangers. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon sir. You must be Megan's auntie? That's right, - I've only got the one room. - Oh! That will suit us very well. I rent it weekly, otherwise it's two shillings a day, full board. Splendid. Megan. Make the Gentlemen some tea And get the spare room ready. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon sir. Joe. Glass of water. You'll be wanting a wash? I could do with more than a wash my girl. - There's a pool down by the lower meadow. - It's not very deep. - It's fine for Dick and Rik. - Well, I'll try it. - You stay here and rest. - No, I'll come with you. What are you two staring at? Go on then take the gentlemen's knap-sack! Thank you boys. Come on in. It'll do you a power of good. I wonder if the girl comes in here for a dip. Leave her alone can't you? What? - I said leave her alone. - Why? - Because you've got a filthy mind. So have you, but the only difference is you don't use it! You've ever seen a couple of nancies before then? They are gentlemen, but of course you wouldn't know about that. Give us a kiss then. Oh! You stink! You really do! You could do with a wash. No, Joe, you really smell. - There's more if you're still hungry. - Thank you very much, Megan. If you want anything else. I'll be in the kitchen. - Oh! Why don't you stay and talk to us? - Auntie will be wanting me, sir. Oh! Come on! Just for a minute.. - Does your uncle own this farm? - My Uncle? Oh! Mr. Narracombe died years ago. So you've been bought up here with your cousins? No sir, Joe and the boys are not my cousins. Auntie, Mrs. Narracombe took me on when my mum died. - What about your father? - I don't know. He wasn't from these parts. Welsh are you? You have a Welsh name. Can I go now, sir? Of course, we shouldn't be keeping you here like this. You know, if you don't mind my saying this your friend being a doctor and all. You need a poltice on your ankle I know how to do it. Rick said it was wonderful. When he fell from the hay wagon. Thank you. I'll certainly give it a try. Thank you sir. She's rather interesting. Did you see how pretty she's when she blushed? I knew she wasn't just a farm girl at all. - What do you think? - Her manners are better than yours. Beyond that, I have no opinion. You know, I don't think my ankle is going to be better by tomorrow. Stay here for a few days, Rest it up. - Meg, where did they come from? - From London, I think. - How far away is London, Meg? - Whew! A long way. - A thousand miles? - Hmm! Most likely a thousand miles. Nine o'clock. Who the Dickins goes to bed at nine o'clock? You know, Joe told me that the nearest pub is 10 miles away. Absolutely barbarick! No wonder these peasants are so in-bread. What's that smell? Pigs Probably! Leave me! Please! I got them anyway. I'm the bogey! I'm the bogey! Whoever makes noise, Joey the bogey will come and get you. Meg is the bogey! Meg is the bogey! You'll bother the Gentlemen. - Joe knows - What does Joe know only mangle werzells and turnips. Joe understands only from cattle and pig washing. Joe said he saw them in the pond stark naked! Now don't gabble. God won't hear a word you say if you gabble. Our father, who is in heaven ... You know old chap... I'm not sure I can actually stand it here ... - Despite the attractions. - What? I might push back to town in the morning if I can find a railway station in this God forsaken place. I think there's one at Bovey Tracey. Are you sure you don't mind? Will you be alright? - I'll be alright. - Splendid! It won't hurt, sir. What's in it? That stuff your puttin on? A bit of this and that. You wouldn't know if I told you. - It's soothing. - It's very soothing. I'm afraid Mr. Garton wouldn't approve though. What did you think of him? He seemd to have been in a great hurry to be gone this morning. - He said something funny? - Funny? When I gave him breakfast this morning he told me that I was the daughter of Bard. Is it true what he said, that your a poet? Not really. I just write poetry from time to time. - Actually I'm a barrister. - So your a lawyer then. Yes. - What's so funny about that? - Your much too young to be a lawyer. I'm sorry, sir. Best get you slippers, you'll never get your shoe over that. - Good morning, Joe. - Morning. You'll be leaving tonight then? Well, actually, I asked your mother if I could stay on for a few days. It's a good idea to rest it, don't you think? We don't rest much in these parts. It's only a bruise anyhow. I got it. It's all right, Miss. I can do that.. "Miss David?" again. You've come up in the world haven't you mate. - Mind your own business. - Now you can walk. - Thank you very much. Come on then, Miss David. Come in. Auntie says would you like to try a piece of her caraway cake.- That's very kind. Where is everybody? - I mean, where do you sit in the evening? - In the kitchen, sir. Can I come in for a while? I get lonely here. Well.. Do you want to bring your cake then. - Are you alright? Let me help you. - I'm sorry. - I feel so stupid. - Put your arm around my shoulders, sir. Just get the balance. You don't have to call me "sir", - But what shall I call you? Aston is is my last name. My name is Frank. Very well.. Mr. Aston. Be careful of your head. You don't want that bashed. - Oh no, you never seen a dragon. - Yes I did. With fire spitting out. And then you woke up. He's a liar. I asked Megan if I could join you for a few minutes. I hope you don't mind. Megan put a chair by the fire, We're just finishing dinner. - Boys, help Mr Aston can you. - No, I can manage. - Let me. Thank you. Please carry on. I really don't want to disturb you. Megan, serve Mr. Aston with a glass of elderberry. This is Jim. He takes care of the animals. Rick told us how saw a dragon this morning. - A dragon? For God, where? - In the woods, yes, I did! - Don't you have dragons in London? - Ho, plenty. Not the kind Rick means I'm sure. The cake is delicious. Sure my mother would like the recipe. - The what? - What it's made of. It's not written. It never has been. Not like, how to jump gates. That's not been written down either, eh. The wine is very good too. Megan, she makes it. You put something in it don't you mate? Well here's to whatever it is. I assume it is a secret too. Oh Eye, our Megan is a real witch. Joe, stop it! - What's got into you? - Nothing. - You did something. - Anything. Then give me a kiss. Kim! Come on now! - Come on, boys. Up to bed with you now. - But it's Saturday tomorrow. And you'll be up all hours. - Up to bed right now! - Catch me! I'll catch you on the end of my broom I will. I can see frogs can you? And I can skin you, with this long knife. I need to clear the table if you don't mind. - Of course not. Just carry on, - I'm sorry - Why? If I intrude. Megan? - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - How's your ankle today? - Better. It's still painful though. So. When do you think you'll be going? Well, if you could put up with me for a few more days if it's not too much trouble. Oh, it's no trouble same terms? - Of course. It'll be nice and quiet for you today. Megan's taken the boys shearing at Beecher's. So today ... I don't like it mind. So. Suppose we must change with the times. - And Joe, has he gone too? - Joe's working. - Good morning, Jim! - Morning, sir! - How far is Beecher's farm from here? - Beechers? That's about four miles. Straight up the road there, right by the high rocks. You'll be wanting to see the shearing I reckon. - Four miles? I see your leg's better, sir. My leg? Oh, my ankle. Yes, that's fine, thank you. Could I borrow a trap, a horse? Well there's Meg's old bicycle in the shed. If you can ride that. Thank you, that will do very well. She's right wilful is our Meg when she sets her mind to it. - Really. Farmer Narracombe wouldn't let the boys roam with the Beecher's. Farmer Narracombe would speak one word to farmer Beecher's for neigh ten years. - Right old fued they had. - So, Joe dosn't go to the shearing? No, no, he's mighty stubbon is Joe. But Megan will win him over, you'll see. Yes. Right at the big rocks, you say? That's it, over the moors. Thank you. Collect aside. It's not like this, Side collection. I asked him: "What do you want me to call you " And he said, "Mr. Ashton is fine, but my name is Frank .. "" Wine. I'm coming, good people. Who would that be? Who's that? Meg. It's him! It's Mr. Ashton! Hi, Megan. I've come to see the shearing. Your welcome, I'm sure. Come on, children. We have work to do. This is Mr. Ashton. Mr. Bicer. He's been staying with us for a while. He's Betsy's father. - Have you ever seen a sheep? - Of course. Do you want to stay here? Ok! Yes! It's fantastic! Do they ever cut them? No. Not Really. Look she's been cut and they cover it with pitch. Come on blondie have a go. Is that her boyfriend? - No. Like this? Look, I've got new drawers! His mother asked if he could stay for the prom. It's nothing to do with me. Good thing Joe isn't here. Bravo, blonde, you'll get used to it! Come on, Betsy! - He probably won't notice anyway - Oh! Yes, he will! You want more? You're in trouble boy! - Is your ankle alright? - Shall we go out side? - Do you know what the time is? - Nope. - One o'clock. - Are you going? - I'm going in the trap with you. - You can't stop over. The boys have been in bed long ago. - Then I'll stay. - You can't, the house is full. I can sleep on the wool. - I'll get you a blanket. It'll be cold. - It's alright. Megan, in the morning, you better leave and find me elsewhere don't you think? This was the most marvelous day of my life. - Me too. You danced really well. I won't come back inside. Tell the others Iv'e gone. - Megan. - Yes? Nothing ... Good night. - Megan, what are you doing? - I brought you a blanket. Thank you. - You shouldn't have. - Well, I have. It's spookey in here. Do you care for me, Mr. Ashton? Of course I care for you. You came looking for me, didn't you? Yes, yes I did. Hug me.. No, no. - That's what you came for isn't it? - No. Why did you come? Why bring the blanket? Why? Because I love you. Mr Aston. I love you. Now you can kiss me. - You're beautiful. - Am I? - It's going to be alright, isn't it? - Of course it will. You'll go away? I have to go away sometime.. - Not yet. - No, not yet. What are we going to tell them? Well, I'll pick you up on the road, if you like. You were too tipsy to ride the bike. - And where did I sleep? - Hedges. What if they don't believe me? The boys will tell your aunt. No they wont. Nick wants a new knife And Rick wants flights for his rod. Megan. You're wicked. Goodness, who's that? What are you doing down there, Mr. Aston? - You fell off the bike? - Looks silly. Have you broken the bike? You'd better tie your bike on, Mr. Ashton! Home we go. You live in a castle, Mr. Aston? No, just a house in Chelsea. It's not much bigger than yours. - Have you got servants? - A few. Gates, somebody. Joe and Aunt went to church. What about you, Megan? - Don't you go to church? - Meg's afraid of pass-over. No I'm not, I just don't like the way he looks at me. I'm bad, always talking about sin and damnation. - Don't believe in sin then? - No, why should I? Tonight? Where? By the river. Will you come? "I met a lady in the meads, full beautiful, a faery's child, Her hair was long. Her foot was light, and her eyes were wild. She found me roots of relish, sweet and honey Wild and manna dew. And sure in language strange, she said: I love thee true. What are you wearing that blouse for? Not having something are we? I just feel like it, that's all. Ah. She just feels like it. I'm feeling like a walking.. I feel something is wrong here. Something's not right. Dancing all at night at Beeches, up on the hill reading poetry. Something's not right! It's time you and me named the day. Well, Meg, cat got your tongue? I live here now, what's the difference? - "What's the difference?" she says! - Now, Joe. She's been on the farm all her life. And she says "what's the difference"? I'll tell you the difference girl. Me and you, stuck in the big four poster And cuddling up when the wind blows. A baby In the arms and a few skeletons I should'nt wonder. It's Mrs. John Naracombe you'll be. That's the difference. Jo, let it by a while. She's only a lass. Come on, Megan, what's your answer? - Excuse me. - Good night. Where are you? What are we doing now with Joe? - I'll take care of Joe. - But what can we say? Trust me, oh, I'll look after you. Do you still love me? - Yes. I just want to be with you. You're so beautiful. - Good morning, sir. I hope you slept well - Like a log, thank you. - How's that ankle? - Oh. It's much better, thank you. So you can leave then. Well, I'v been meaning to ask you if I can stay on a bit longer. It's so peaceful here. And your all so kind. I got friends with Rick and Nick you know. - I'm sorry, but that's not covenient. - I beg your pardon? The room's let from Friday. A Gentleman comes here every year. A Lord. I brought you your bill here. You'll see it's okay You've been here for a week, There are 14 shillings, like I told you. Mr Garton paid his part, when he left. Please, I've made no other arragements. Can't I possibly stay until tomorrow, please? I've got to get the room turned down. I didn't know your position before, I really would be much obliged. Alright, Friday then. But early mind. And that will be another two shillings. - Yes, of course. I think you best be getting back to London, sir. - Where's Megan? - She be gone to the market with Joe. - The market is on a Thursday. - But she didn't tell me? What happened? Dora packed her off in a mighty hurry. Who, Megan, with Mrs. Naracombe? Yes, sir. Angy words. Thank you Jim. You've been sulking all day. Well then, I'll bide my time. You think he be waiting for you don't you? Well, he won't. He most likely gone already Get some sense in yourself my girl. Leave Megan alone. How dare you put your hands on her? How dare I? How dare I? Megan is mine! That's why! I'll lay my hands on you as well. And I can hit you! Think like a man, boy! It's not your business! It bothers me when someone upsets a lady that's my business! Listen to him "lady" he says! No! Stop it! Joe! You've been nothing but trouble since you came here. Coming where you aint wanted. I tell you, Megan don't want you! None of us want you! So get back to where you came from, "Sir". See what the ladies makes of you there. Meg. I want to talk to you. - We have to talk. - He said you were going. - Your not going are you? - Your aunt has let the room, It isn't true, she wants you away from here. I'm going to take you with me.

I could get work and then.. Till Saturday, you promise? Oh, promise. - You will take care of me?

What about you? - What? - Are you married? - No. - What are all the festivities? - Coronation Celebration. Last week was ridiculous with war ships in the bay. - What brings you here? - I've been walking on the moors. Yes I thought you looked a bit rough. I don't know how I recognized you. Phil! We're over here! There they are! Look who I found. It's my old school chum, Frank Ashton. Loafing about in heavy disguise. My sister Stella. - How do you do. - Sabina and Frida, named Fred. - Sabina. - How do you do sir? - Helo Fred. - Helo. - Sit down old chum. - Do forgive me, I feel a terrible tramp. Ive walked about the moors for a couple of weeks. Like a gypsy? How perfectly stunning. No. Not like a Gypsy, though I may look like one. I've been staying on a farm. Oh. I love the idea of staying on a farm. But aren't the animals rather smelly? - That you say? - There were people. But I can't understand a word they say, can you? Well, I don't know about that. Meg. I was looking for you. - What for? - Well I said to myself she might be grieving. - Why should I? Well he's gone aint he. - He not comming back neither. - He might send for me. Meg. Is that the truth now. Your not going. Meg. My pretty girl! Leave me. I've not been good to you. Not been kind - I'd like your forgiveness if you can. - I'll forgive you, if you name the date. Fixes the date, and be done with all this fooling. - I'll think on it. - When? I'll tell you ... Tomorrow. I think you'd better come shrimping with us this afternoon. What do you say? I'm sorry, I can't, not that I don't like to. You must! You just must! Fred, stop it, the gentleman surely has something to do. I'm afraid so, terribly romantic things. Like going to the bank, Finding a bed for the night. If that's the case. Stay here old chum. - That's very kind of you. But a place like this is beyond my means. - My dear fellow - in any case I have to leave early in the morning. Good Afternoon. Have you heard from my bank? - Your bank, sir? You sent a telegram this morning Ashton, Frank Ashton. Ah yes. Of course. - I'm sorry sir. No reply as yet. - What shall I do? I have a train to catch first thing in the morning! We open at 10:00am Sir. Next! POST OFFICES You cant send a telegram to this address. It dosn't makes sense. Of course it makes sense? Betsy, Beecher Farm near Widdicombe. - But Betsy? - Yes, for God's sake! If you use bad language to me I'll call my dad. - I'm sorry. - Have you got the letter? - "Delay, please wait." There's no signature. You can't send it without a signature. Nonsense. If your going to persist then I shall call your dad. That's four pence. But it won't get there today. Not out at Widdicombe. - But it'll get there in the morning? It might, though mind you tomorrow is Saturday. It's Mr. Aston! He's come back! Help! Help! Help! - Phil! It's Phil! - He's drowning! Could someone help us, please! Keep your head out of the water. Keep you head up. You're all right, Phil. I think We'd better to go to the hotel. I feel a bit of a fraud. Still I'm glad you decided to stay. I am only sorry, I have to leave first thing in the morning. - Are you sure you'll be alright? - As right as rain old chap. - We must meet each other in London. - Yes. Yes Of course. It's none of my business old man. But I get the feeling your worried about something. - Now you mentioned you were short of cash... - It's just a tempory mix-up at the bank. - I am very grateful to you. - You don't have to be. God, Aston, You probably saved my life. It's a funny thing you know, thinking when you drown. They say the whole of your life passes before your eyes. - Well did it? - No. But there was one thing. A girl at Cambridge. I've forgotten her name. Pretty little thing. I was dotty about her. I found myself thanking God that I hadn't.. That I didn't have to feel guilty about her. How do you explain that? Yes I see. Very charming. So your in love are you? - Desperately. I can't live without her, Phil. God. It's a relief to talk about her. Are you sure you don't mind? - No, no not at all. You'd understand if you met her. Magical. Wonderful. And your going to carry her off on your white charger and live happy ever after. - You don't believe me. - Of course I believe you. But you don't think you should give it a bit more thought? You'll be uprooting her from everything she knows. And besides will she .. Will she exactly fit in your life? - Megan loves me. - I'm sure she does. But is that enough? It's all that matters. - Miss Holliday. - We missed you at dinner. Yes, I'm sorry. I wasn't hungry. I just wanted to thank you for what you did. - It was nothing really. - If you hadn't been there .. - Do you believe in destiny? Like things were meant to happen - Not really. I believe in free will. Or at least I think I do. I'm afraid your leaving us tomorrow on your own free will. Not entirely. - Goodbye then, - Goodbye Stella. - Goodbye, Frank. Miss! How much does it cost? - A penny, sir. Have you heard from my bank? Frank Ashton. Just a moment, sir. If you please. Now. Ashton you say? And the bank is? - Chelsea branch. You sent a telegram yesterday! Chelsea ... That would be South West London would it not?. I have a train to catch at 10. please see if it's arrived There is no telegraph. Sir. No telegram. - There must be. Next, please. - Ah! Mr. Ashton! - Oh, thank God for that! What time is the next train leaving for Bovi? - At 6.10 pm. But it is very slow, it doesnt get in till near 9. And tomorrow morning? - That's a Sunday sir. There is no train to Bovi on a Sunday. Oh, Betsy! I'm so frightened I could die! Do you think I'm daft? Daft or not, you going to wait on the rocks. Miss Beecher, a telegram! A telegram? - It's for me! - No, it's for me. "Delayed, please wait." Something's wrong. - What will you do? - He said wait. He will come today, I know he will. - Suppose he dosn't? - I'll go find him. - You won't find him. - He'll come, I trust him. I told you my spell would work. I was on the street just a minute ahead. And you wouldn't have found me. I timed it exactly. What was so important? - Do you have a lady? - Frida, be quiet! - Have you Frank have you a lady? - That's rather personal. It's none of your business. It must have gone five now. - He won't coming now. - He said to wait. I'll wait. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I'd better go help with dinner. Tell them I went for a walk. You don't know where I am. And Betsy. When he comes I will be down for the trap. - Be ready. - Bye. I'm glad you decided not to go after all. I'm afraid I didn't decide. I missed the train. Then, It wasn't of your own free will. It must have been providence. Or Sabina's witchcraft. Providence or fate. Whatever you call it. Well, I think we should be getting back. - No! I want to hear the music! - I want to see the fireworks! Can I have an ice cream! Let's just hear the band. - Come on, Stella! - Come on, fast. What's the problem old chap, has something gone wrong? - No. Well I missed the train. - The next one is at 6:30 pm. - You will lose that one too. Stella! I don't want to spoil her day. Do you want to catch that train or don't you? It dosn't get there till after 9 o'clock It'll be dark. She'd have gone home. I can do nothing. - Mr. Aston. - Sorry. - Can you tell me where the hotels are please? - Yes. All along the seafront. You didn't really want to come to church. Did you? - Not much - Then why did you? Well, you know what Lord Tennyson said, "All experiences are valuable." Stella reads Lord Tennyson. She reads in her bed at night. - Does she indeed? I think Frank and Stella will be a very romantic couple. Soon we will be aunt. Come on, girls this way. I understand you like Tennyson. - But you don't like church. - I'm not really a believer. If you don't believe in it, What makes you be kind to people? - Why don't you behave like animal? - Because I'm not an animal. Neither are you. We are civilized, thank God. There you are, "Thank God" Do you think your free? I belive in being good Because being good is good itself. - Sometimes I fail horribly. - Why are you sorry when you fail? Do you want forgiveness? I'm sorry when I make mistakes. That's human. And It's... What's the matter Frank? Terribly sorry. I have to take you back to the hotel. - What is it? - I'd quite forgotten, I had to meet someone. Are you coming for lunch? Ah, yes Quite slipped my mind. Tell Phil I shant be long. Thank you, Stella. - But Frank! 18 years later. Why have I come back? To try somehow to capture a moment of hopelessness. Desperately longing for her forgiveness. For some sort of miracle. Where is she now, the girl I'd wronged so cruely? - Hey, sir. - Good Afternoon. - Is that your Motor up on the road sir? - Yes, that's right. Don't see many of them in these parts. Just going around, were you. Yes I saw your farm. It's rather beautiful. - That's right. Oh. Ah. It is that. Forty odd years I've been there now. There's been some changes I can tell you. Three sons there were. Now there's only young Rick the boy and myself. - Were you in the war sir? - Yes I was. And the woman taking in the washing? Joe's wife. I should say Widow. I see. Well. Thank you. - You've been here before, sir? - No, I don't think so.. That'll be young Francis after a fox. A fine shot. I'm afraid I must go now. Not yet, sir. I've got Something to show you. You know what this is? It's a grave, sir. She was a young girl, she was. Megan David What happened then? Well, she fell in love with one of these young college gentlemen. Staying at the farm. Nice feller too, with his head in the air. Or so we thought. He took off sudden one morning and she went after him. A pluckey lass. Maybe it were two days. We never knew where she was. Then one evening she were back. I have never seen a human creature so changed in all my life. Never. We often saw her waiting on the bridge for him. Staring up the track. Like a lost soul she were. It weren't long before we all knew why. She were taken to her bed in February. He was to be born on Easter. Three days it took and four nights. She never even saw the babe. I laid her to rest up here on the moor. Poor girl. - Why here? - It was Meg's last wish. It's the place where she first saw the young gentleman. She wanted to look at the line of the road. When he should come back for her. - What happened to the child? - He's a fine boy, sir. - What's his name? - He were baptised Francis. That's what Meg wanted. Frank? You've got children of your own by now? Mr. Ashton? No, no children. Frank, where are you? There you are Didn't you hear me calling? I finished my sketches And I'm absolutely starving. I thought you were going to bring the picnic down. - Yes, I am sorry. Oh. it's too late now. I suppose we'd better go on to Torquay. Goodbye, Jim. - Frank, I'm ready. - Yes dear, I'm coming.
