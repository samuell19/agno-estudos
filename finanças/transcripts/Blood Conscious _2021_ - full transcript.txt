You sure we didn't go too far? I'm seeing a lot of nothing up ahead. Trust me, we've been coming here since Kevin was little. We almost didn't go this year, but I guess dad wanted to show off for you. Well, I told him I never been up here. It's late in the season. I guess we'll have the place more to ourselves that way. Oh, that's us. Old Bear Road. Now we're talking. I cannot wait to get out on that lake. What's the point? It's too cold to swim anyway. Like you got anything better to do, besides drinking in your dorm. Um, Kevin doesn't drink, he plays video games. Are you kidding me? So what? No one ever got laid sitting in front of a - computer screen. - Oh, shut up. He's just teasing. You think I'm joking? Man, you gotta be out there making it happen. You're the salesman. As in business, so in life. You think I turn off when I leave the office? Hell no, I'm selling, selling, selling myself, my image, who I am and what I'm about. Sell to someone else. And I'll tell you something else, I'm not just sellin', I'm closing. New car, own it, plush condo, movin' in. Lovely lady, locked her down too. I don't think Kev's ever closed, Kev? You wanna give your mom a call, Bee? You better add her to your contacts. Come April, she's gonna be your mom too. She's in there. Don't lie to me. Check my phone, she's in there. Hm-hm. No answer. Maybe they're out? Lay up on him this weekend, he's trying. Everything's cool on my end. Let your parents worry about him, I'm on vacation. Kev, come on, we're here. At least they're here. Did they say anything to you about having car trouble? No, Kev? Nobody tells me nothin'. Mom? dad? Anybody home? When he gets out, let's go on over to the big cabin, see if we can get our keys. Why did we even bother coming out here? Relax, a little fresh air never killed anybody. We've got fresh air at home. Are you two gonna do this all weekend? It's just a couple days. What is your problem? I thought you liked coming here? Yeah, in the summer when there are other people around. Yeah, it's the off season, I guess. Hello! Oh, seriously? Anybody here? Well. Hello, anybody home? Mr. Maisky? This guy know you? Neighbors from next door! Hello? Stop! What, they don't care. There's food in the car. Ridiculous, four hours outside the city and you don't know how to act. Yeah. What do you bet they're all out on somebody's boat together? They should text, at least. There's another house across the road, let's check with them. Yo, I see them! Hey mom, we didn't see you inside, we were wondering where everyone was. No. Dad, dad, no please, dad, dad, dad come on, please, please, dad, please. Oh, no, no, please, please. I just knew y'all were out here grilling... Freeze! Nobody fuckin' move! Dad? That's dad. Easy now, no need to hurt us. Shut up! Are you humans or are you demons? We're on vacation. Mom, where's our mom? Where's our mom? No, no. They weren't human anymore, the demons took 'em. We don't know nothin' about no demons, buddy. I'm not your buddy. When'd you get here? We just got in. You just happen to stop in, huh? That's right, we, we just drove in. Keys! What? Give me the keys! Now move! Let's go, move, toward the house. Move, that's it, inside, let's go. Inside, that's right. Down on the floor. All the way, arms out, that's it, good. Now I want you to count to a thousand, if anybody so much as moves a finger before then, I'll blow your fuckin' brains out, you got that? - Yes. - Yeah. - One, two... - Good. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. What do we do now? Call the cops. There's only one way outta here, they'll have a roadblock set up by the time he hits the highway. Careful, he said he would come back. He's not comin' back. Shit, get down! All right, your cellphones. Hand 'em over. What about you? No, I left mine in my dorm. Seriously, seriously, I don't have it, I promise you. You really wanna do this? I don't wanna have to shoot you. Well, then don't, just leave us alone, please. How about I shoot her instead? I'll do it, you seen - the dead bodies out there. - Take-Take it, take it. Here, here. That's better. Now if you folks really are human, I'm sorry, but I can't take any chances. You ain't seen what I seen. Now I want you to lock this door, and don't let anybody in 'til sun up. I mean anybody. The fuck. Why did he keep asking if we were humans? I don't know, because he's a nutcase or on drugs or both? What the hell does it matter at this point? They are dead, and... and there's nothing we can do about it. They're dead, they're... - they're all dead, everybody's... - Easy, easy now. We're all alive, now we're gonna get through this, that's what counts. Maybe somebody has a phone in the other cabins. Right, or a set of keys. It doesn't look like he's coming back this time. We should be safe enough. Let's go then. Hello! Help! Yo guys, he might hear you! Dude seemed pretty eager to get as far away from here as possible. Tony? Tony? Nothin' in there. Do you know how to hotwire it? Tony! Tony! I can't go in any more. There's nothing. They're all dead, everyone. Okay. Nothing in the basement? Nothing I'm going down there to look for. Is there a phone line anywhere? Yeah, but no phone. I just checked all the bodies on the lake, no keys, no nothing. My guess is he took 'em. Either before or after. What are we gonna do? It's only a few miles to the highway. Gas station maybe 10 miles back from there. Let's go. I'll move faster on my own. And leave us here, alone with them? We shouldn't split up now that it's dark. I can jog it. You two will be fine, just stay here, uh, make a fire or something. Look what I found. It could be a dead man's shoes. You don't know that. They're a little tight, but they'll do. Stay strong for a few more hours. If I can flag someone down on the highway, I'll come right back for you, okay? Be back soon. What are we supposed to do now? Just sit and wait for Tony to ride back in? Honestly I'm surprised you didn't offer to go instead. He's older, I'm a kid. Christ, you're nineteen. You need a babysitter? What's your problem? He wanted to go. I don't know what's out there, this is bear country. Oh, God, if something happens to him... He'll be okay. It's only a couple miles to the highway, anyway, they say bears don't usually attack humans, so... But what if he gets to the highway and he can't get a lift? He'll be running on the shoulder all night. Somebody will pick him up. A brother? At night, out here? More likely they'll swerve to hit him. Well, he's a smart guy, he won't let that happen. I just, I can't stop shaking, I keep seeing mom and dad. Did you see them? Yeah, I saw them. If something happens to him, I don't know what I'll do, he's all I got. He'll be okay, really. Damn it, where is he? If somebody did pick him up, he could be on his way back. Yeah, but he might not even be to the highway yet. Hmm. Christ, I wish I had a Xanax. Hold on. Oh, Kevin, don't leave. I'm not going anywhere. I saw these in the fridge earlier. Nice. I thought you said you didn't drink? You said I didn't drink. Nothing's ever gonna be the same again. You know, I'm starting to regret not checking the rest of those houses while it was still light. I don't. I wonder if maybe someone left their phone, maybe... It's him! No! What do you want? What'd you do, tip them off, let him know I was comin'? What the fuck are you talkin' about? I'm talking about the road, girly. The ambush. They burnt the goddamn car. No, wait, we're humans, we can prove it to you, look, I... I've got a pulse, feel it. I don't think so. Kevin! Against the wall! Do it! - No, no, no, no. - Do it! Stop looking at me. Wait, wait, wait, wait, we're... we've been drinking. Do demons drink alcohol? The hell do I know? Why would they? Give me one of those. No, no! Oh, my God... Tony! You mother... fucking... piece of shit! Jesus, Tony, don't kill him, do not kill him. Why not? You saw what he did to your parents, he woulda killed you too. But... but the law, the cops need to see how crazy he is. Otherwise, who's to say we didn't do it? Right. Give me that shotgun. Tony? Give it to me! Up! Go on, do it! Don't. I won't unless I have to. What are we supposed to do with him now? Kitchen. Be my guest. Fuck you! Climb down yourself or I'll blow both of your feet off and push you down. You folks better be careful, because them things are coming back. They're comin' back for you! They're comin' back! All right, all right, I was wrong. Let me outta here. Come on. He's gonna be at it all night. What do you want me to do? You told me not to kill him. You don't need to do anything, I was just sayin'. Hey, uh, it's not what you're thinking. You guys ain't safe up there. We hear you, and we don't care. Shut the fuck up! Enough of this. Are you gonna let him out? No, I'm gonna double check there's no other way out of that cellar. I'm not listening to this shit all night. Why do we have to go? 'Cause they're comin', you could bet on it. Who, the police? The demons, you dumb shit. Like those dead things out there. Those were my parents, they were innocent people. No, they weren't, I'm no murderer, those were demons. They look like you and me, but they ain't, they're possessed or something. Well, how'd they get like that? I don't know, do I look like a fucking psychologist? Psychopath, more like it. Hey, hey kid, there's something down here with me. What is it? I don't know. I think I saw somebody. There's something here with me. Uh, is Tony down in the cellar? No, stop talking to that lunatic, he's just trying to manipulate you. Uh, Tony, were you just down in the cellar? There's nobody down there. Yes, there is. There's something here, you gotta let me out of here now! Um, I'm sorry. It's one of them, please, get down here, bring the gun! Please God, please help me, it's down here, it's down here with me! Hey, stop, help! There's somebody in here! What if there's really something down there with him? There's not, he just wants out. I hope it's a bear, and I hope it takes its time with you! Hey, stop! Uh... Yo, asshole you down there? All right, follow me down, but stay close. I can't see a thing. Don't, let's just close the door, it was an act, he wants you to go down. He could be dead. I'm telling you, he's fine. He won't be when I find him. What if he doubles back and climbs back up? Uh, here. There you go, poke him until he goes back down. What the hell? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Tony? Kev? Are you guys all right? Is he, is he dead? I don't know. Nothin', he's dead. Who did that to him? Looks like the whole shelf just fell down on top of him. Maybe he was trying to climb up. Climb to where? Hello? Hello? I've got a knife. We're comin' up! So he was already dead? Accident, it looked like, or suicide even, for all I know. I don't think he would've tried to kill himself. Based on what? Your Psych 101 lecture this semester? I... I just think it's a dumb way to do it. Like I said, it probably tipped over on him as he tried to climb up. Uh, head first? What difference does it make? He's dead, isn't he? Well, the difference is whether or not somebody did that to him. Who? I don't know, he said there was somebody down there with him. Kev... Of course that's what he said, he was trying to sucker you. And, and then he just tipped over a shelf and died? It was dark, he didn't know what was happening, it... it was too heavy for him. All right, but, but he said that there was somebody... You wanna go back downstairs and take a second look? No. Good, neither do I. There's somebody out there. Police? I don't think so, you see anyone? No. It's the person from the cellar, we let them out! What? Tony, get down! Why? Maybe they have a car I'm going outside. No, please, just... just stay here. What's wrong? It could be a killer or something, just... just get down. Go on! Ugh. This is stupid. It's not stupid, it's cautious. Look, whoever's outside already knows we're in here. All the lights are on. Shit. Hello, is anybody there? Please! She's calling for help. Wait, wait, we don't know if it's safe! Ma'am? Oh, God, oh, please don't! Please God, don't kill me! Calm down, lady, it's... Uh, we are here to help, no one is gonna hurt you. He took my Walter. What? Uh, no, that man... that killer is dead, we took his gun. This is Tony, he didn't hurt anyone. How do I know you're telling me the truth? You're just gonna have to trust us. Look. See, there. We don't wanna hurt you, I'm Brittney a-and this is Tony and Kevin. Margie, Margie Nealands. You look tired, Margie. Do you wanna come inside and we'll get you something to eat and drink? I guess I could use some water. Be careful she doesn't go - for the gun... - Shut up. Go for the gun? Well, if she's a demon, we... Sorry, this is all we got. Thank you. This all still feels like some kind of nightmare. We lost family too. Can you tell us what happened? What you saw? Only... only if you feel comfortable talking about it. I think so. There was, uh, an African American couple. Our parents. When the man with the gun ran out onto the island, your father was the one who found him. Some of the others had wanted to run, but he wouldn't go. He was the first over the bridge with Walter. Brave men. God rest their souls. When I heard the shots, and no one came back, I crept up and looked. We... we saw it too. The woods seemed like the best place to run, but after a few hours, I was so lost, I didn't know which way to go to find the highway. My phone had no service. I'd probably still be out there if I hadn't followed the music and seen the lights from the house. You're safe now, that man is dead. Maybe we can get service on your phone from here. Ours were stolen. I'm afraid I lost mine in the dark, stupid! No. How did you know he wasn't still here? Who? The crazy guy, how'd you know it was safe? Kevin. If you'd spent a night alone in those woods, young man, you wouldn't ask that question. You start to see things in the darkness, I didn't care whether I lived or died, I just didn't wanna be alone anymore. Do you remember seeing another gunman? Did he have anyone helping him? One was enough. He started while most of us were out on the lake, by the time we got back, all the cars were disabled, there was nowhere to go. Kevin thought there might have been someone. No, I didn't see anyone else. There was only the one man. And now he's dead. All we need to do is sit tight for the rest of the night, I wanna get moving as soon as the sun comes up. Tony, not again. This time we all go together, no one stays behind. In that case, I suppose I should get some rest. Yeah, maybe find a comfy spot? Yeah, we should all lay down for a bit. It's gonna be a long walk tomorrow. Yeah, you're probably right. What are you lookin' for? I don't know, I just... it just doesn't add up. Look, I don't know what happened down there in the cellar. It... it's not that, it's her. I mean, what was all that shit about dad being brave and all? There's no way he went charging across that bridge. We don't know that, you don't know what he would've done. You remember that time he got robbed downtown? He just... he just gave those guys his money, they didn't even have guns or knives or anything. So? When I asked him why he didn't put up a fight, he was all, like, "I'd rather be alive than a hero." Maybe he didn't think he had a choice this time. People were counting on him. Okay, but did you notice anything else weird? What? She didn't even ask how the crazy guy, like the killer, how he died, uh it's like she didn't care or she already knew. But she's probably just exhausted and confused. I bet she's not even all the way there after what happened. You think about that, Sherlock? Mm, no. Uh, I bet she doesn't even know half of what she's been saying. Don't turn this into a grand jury hearing, it's just some little old white lady who watched her husband get blown away. I didn't think about it that way. We know what happened, let's just get to the police and worry about the details later. Sure. We're waiting for you. We're waiting for you. We're waiting for you. We're waiting for you. We're waiting for you. Excuse me, young man. What are you doing up? Are you looking for something? There's a phone, you had your phone on you this whole time. I did? Then I didn't lose it after all. What's going on? Cellphone, we have her cellphone. I thought you said you lost it? Uh, like you said yourself, I... I was exhausted and confused. Like I said when? What? When did I say that? Kev, just give me the phone, - let me try to reach somebody - Just a second. Margie, were you listening to Kevin and me? Yeah, we thought you were asleep. I'm not on trial here. And I'd like to know where you get the right, searching through my things. I better not have any money missing. Are you serious? Tony, do you hear this? Ma'am, - this is unnecessary. - Don't ma'am me. What was I supposed to think? I, I wake up to find this little thief going through my purse. You should be thanking him for finding the phone. Kev, just call the police. I'll call, give me the phone. Excuse me, but I raised four kids and I am perfectly capable of using my own phone. It is my phone. Thank you. Wouldn't you know, no service. - What, come on... this is... - Just try calling. Whoa, whoa, cool it. Everybody calm down. Margie, why don't you try to see if you can get service outside? We had it earlier. But she's lying. - We're not... - Can it. I am the victim here, in case you forgot. I lost my Walter. We know, Margie. Now take a walk and see if you can get through to the police. I will, and I will tell them how I was treated by you people. Somebody should follow her. Look, you've been messed up since you saw that body downstairs. Kevin! Hey, Margie! How did she not know she had her phone, Tony? Something's not right with her. Well, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to point the gun at her and tell her give it up? Call her ass a demon like the boy genius out there? She's scared and she's alone. Yeah, I just wish we knew. We know enough to get out of this. Not me. Help, help me! What are you doing? We're trying to get out of here! Why did you do that? What are you doing? - He tried to kill me! - She smashed the phone! Look, I was right! Tony! Mof. - Stop! - He's out of his damn mind! She was supposed to call for help! I did, the police said they'll be here any minute! Yeah, don't bet on it! And when they get here, they'll hear an earful from me! Yeah, you're a lying bitch! Tony! Stop hurting him! Are you listening to this kid? He's fuckin' nuts! He doesn't know what he's saying. Kevin, shut up! I'm telling the truth! I'm going inside to wait. You can tell him if he comes in and apologize like a civilized person, I'll think about not pressing charges. Are you okay? That motherfucker. Why did you do that? She smashed the phone! Why would she do that? Come on, let me help you up. Leave me alone. Kevin. Just go! It's okay, I'm sorry you had to go. How is he? What do you care? I'm sorry, Bee, but he was asking for it. To get punched in the face? He's a kid for Gods sakes. He's no kid... anyway, he was gunning for her. He was out of his mind. Yeah, he smashed my phone and then he came at me like a crazy person. He smashed the phone? Yeah, and he might have done worse to me if... if you two hadn't come out there. Well, if everyone had gone to sleep like I told you to, this never would've happened. If we would've been asleep, we would've never found the phone and the cops wouldn't be on their way here. Well, until they get here, your brother better cool his ass down or I'll give him another black eye to cry about. No need for any of that once he cools his boots outside. You are not the law here, you're just an asshole with a gun. For now, that's good enough. Oh, spare us. You never miss an opportunity to give orders. This must be a dream come true for you. Shut it. Or what, you're gonna slug me? Usually you just throw your money around, but I guess waving a gun around works even better. I throw money around? - Yeah - Are you hearing yourself right now? Easy now, it's just talk, she's cracked. This has all been too much for her. You know what? No one here is cracked but you, lady. Maybe keep your mouth shut until the cops get here. Margie? Kevin. Ma'am, I'm real sorry. I.. I don't know what happened out there, maybe all this just got to my head. I'm sorry too, young man. I-i-i should've just given you the phone. Ah, that, that's on me. I, I lost my head there for a minute, again, I'm sorry. Maybe we all got a little out of hand, Kev. Even me. Uh, don't blame yourself, I was asking for it. Kevin? Oh, seriously, and poor Margie here's no demon, she lost somebody just like we did. What was his name, uh, Henry, was it? Walter, my husband's name was Walter. Are you sure about that? Are you sure it wasn't Henry or maybe even Andrew? I think I'd know my husband's name. Well, think very carefully. Are you absolutely certain your husband's name was Walter? She already said his name was Walter, Kevin, give it up. You people are something else! No, I'm just checking because there weren't any Walters lying dead on that island. I got a Henry, a Clayton and an Andrew, but no Walters, not even for a middle name. Those were the only men on that island... besides our dad, of course. Good God. Margie, what the fuck? Oh, good Lord above. Maybe he's still alive, if he's not out there, maybe he made it. He could be hurt. We didn't see any survivors all day. Well, if nobody else cares, I'm going to look. What are you doing? Kevin? Put that fuckin' knife down, boy. Just as soon as she answers my last question. Where are you from, Margie? Those are my things, you have no right. Put it down, Kev, put the knife down. Only when she's answered my question. Where are you from, Margie? Give me back my property! Look, I'll even give you three guesses, city and state, Margie, uh, here, here's a hint, it's in the continental United States. Give me back my property! Oh, I will, but first Margie old gal, where are you from? Give me back my property! Just answer him! Tony? It... it just fired. Kev, you saw, I... I didn't even pull the trigger. I didn't see nothing, I was looking at her. Oh, my God. You... you... you killed her. You were the one waving the fucking knife around. I didn't use it! Why was it even here? I don't know, I... how was I supposed to know she was gonna go for the gun? Oh my God, it was like she had a seizure or something. Oh, that was no seizure. How do you know? Because she was a demon, she was lying to us. No, Kevin, she's dead. Tony, she was gonna use that gun, I saw her. God, that thing just went off on its own. Do you think they'll arrest Tony? I don't know. They wouldn't, would they? I mean, after all the stuff that's happened, they'll know it was an accident, right? What makes you think they'll care? Well, there could be more like her. Kev, would you let up with that? I don't know what was wrong with that lady, but it doesn't matter now. Take a look at the license. Wisconsin? I honestly don't know why she didn't just say that, but... Look at the name. It's not the same. I see it. Mom, dad and all those people are dead, and the only person who survived was lying to us. The whole time, she was lying to us. This is what I've been saying. I think, I think Carol McCarthy ran off into the woods, but someone else, or something else, came out. And if that's true, and there is something in the woods, then who else was out there? You got this, Tone, this is all you. No. Otherwise, Tony would be... What about Tony? How you holding up, baby? Terrible, after what happened today? It was an accident, she came at you. It was an accident, but it was also my fault. And now I'm gonna relive that moment every day for the rest of my life. I owe you an apology... I owe you both an apology. Tonight, these last few hours... this isn't me, this is not who I am. Things just got out of hand so fast. I think we're all out of our heads at this point. Let's just sit tight and wait. Right, for the police. I don't even think she called the police. I think you're right. You do? Yeah, at the very least, she was pretty unstable. Hard to know exactly what was going on there. Yeah, we... we know what you mean. Come on, let's take a walk. Outside? Yeah, outside. Let's do what we shoulda did yesterday, get the hell out of here, together. I'm not walking through the woods in the dark. Nothing to be scared of, we'll stick by the road the entire time. I think we should stay here and wait until it's light. It'll be dawn before we hit the highway! Come on! You're gonna make me go out there alone? If Five-O does show up, I don't want them to find me out there by myself. What could it hurt? But we stay on the road. I'm not going anywhere, it's not safe. It'll be safe if the three of us go together. Kevin, please? Fine. Good. They'll be waiting for us. What? Huh? What did you just say? Let's hope they're waiting for us. The police, I mean. You said, they'll be waiting for us. Did I? My mouth has a mind of its own sometimes. Come on, Kev. No! Kevin! Guys, stop! No man, drop it! Baby, I... Brittney, wait! Come back! Brittney! Come back! Brittney! Come on, please! Bee, come on! Easy, easy. Get off of me! - Somebody help, help... - Shut up! Shut up! I'm not gonna hurt you, but you gotta shut the fuck up. Can you do that? You were dead. Not quite. Well, how did you get out from under those shelves? It wasn't me, ya dumb shit. It was one of them prick demon things. For real? Why do you think I'm standing here in my drawers freezing my ass off? I gotta sit down. You were right, you were telling the truth the whole time. I tried to tell you, but nobody would listen to me. Hey fuck you, you killed my parents, what the fuck were we supposed to think? I thought you were possessed. No, you didn't. Maybe you're right, I made a mistake, I'm sorry. If I'd a taken you with me, well, maybe we'd a got out of this, but now, it's, it's on me. What about you? What do you mean, what about me? Ain't you gonna say you're sorry? No. Oh. Brittney! I can't see either of them, it's too dark. He's only got one shell left. Are you sure? It's my gun, I loaded it. Who the hell are you, anyway? Plumber, came here to fix the shitter. With a shotgun? This is bear country, kid. Bee, come on! You might as well relax, kid. Sit back and wait for that last shotgun blast. Brittney's out there. I just can't sit around and wait here while he hunts her. From what I seen, she can take care of herself. That's my sister, she's all I got left. What do you think you're gonna do out there, anyway? Oh, fuck you. Wait, kid, wait! I don't know what you are, but... What do you mean, what I am? You killed Kevin, I saw it. Baby, you don't even know what you saw. You sound about as fucked up as your crazy ass brother right now. Go inside, I'll show you. No. No? I'm not going inside with you. So you're just gonna stand out here all fucking night? Is that it? Answer one question for me. When are we getting married? Are you serious with this shit Bee? I can't remember the goddamn... What month? What month are we getting married Tony? Ain't nobody getting married. Tony! Kevin? Boy, you better back the... Mother... fff... Kevin. - Are you okay? - I killed Tony! I killed Tony. Kevin, are you okay? I don't know. Are you okay? Hmm? Ah, shit! Now what do we do? Start walking. We ain't walking. Who said anything about we? What do you think, they're just gonna let you two stroll your asses out of here? You don't even know what you're talking about. Oh yeah? Yeah, you should've seen what they done to me. - No one cares - Guys, guys... - what happened to you... - Guys! We're not walking out of here. I've got a better idea. Looks safe enough, right? Uh, be careful, could be some of them demons around. How do we know you're not a demon? Ever think about that? Hey, look! Hey, do, do you guys have a phone? We need the police. Or an ambulance. Come on. Uh I'm... I'm not going up there. Then stay. Oh, shit! Drop it! We've been waiting for you. You? Walter? Shit. What are you?
