I wrote two sermons on the catfish of Africa. Characteristics catfish from Africa are: they grow up very fast, they breed very fast too. And then, they are violent. They eat their own species and destroy the resources of their environment. Muslims are exactly like this fish If children have the notion of Buddhism, they can later to practice it well. Must also that they know how to distinguish, from an early age, who is the enemy and where is the danger. That's why I teach especially to children. In the morning, I first do recite the doctrine to the monks. Then I write. Then I give sermons. Finally, I help people who have been persecuted by Muslims Learn well the title of my sermon: "Believe and love 969." Repeat. "Believe and love 969." 969 is an organism that protects race and religion, without violence or aggression. Do you agree ? Yes OK. Sing. For race and religion. For race and religion. We must adopt 969 for peace to prevail. Some entrepreneurs have well-established businesses. Among them, a rich Muslim has a slogan: "To destroy a race, you have to use the money. " What did he say ? "To destroy a race, you have to use the money. " The Muslim calls it "the sex strategy". He hires a lot of young girls in his business Like that, they see each other every day. They have everything what women like to have. Both sex and desire And since they have both, the girls are getting married with them. When they are a couple, we give them an apartment. Manipulated by these men, they give up their religion. All these workers who work for them and who marry with them abandon their religion. This is the "sex strategy". Does it succeed? Yes, it succeeds. If we let the name respect for human rights, our race will be destroyed, is not it ? Yes, she will be. Our religion too? Her too. She will disappear? Yes, she will disappear. Do not we need a law? If, we need it. That's it. I was born in 1968 in Kyaukse, near Mandalay. When I was in college, my father retired and we had financial difficulties. We had to help him. It was a difficult time. My father sold water in tanks on an oxcart, and I had to walk behind him. I became a monk at 17 years old. At first I thought only stay a few months. But when I learned the Dhamma and practiced meditation, I decided to continue. My family was angry that I decide to stay a monk for life. My father reacted by banging his head against the wall. Near Kyaukse, there is a Muslim village, Lapang. In all Burmese villages around, there have been cases of rape. A girl of 14 years was raped during the night. She was tied to a tree, all naked. We discovered it only in the morning. I was 12 years old. When the authorities investigated, all the Muslims of this village shaved their heads to not be recognized. Today, my Master does not live anymore at the monastery where I studied. He is retired in the countryside for meditation. I met Wirathu when I was 45. He was about 14 years old. This is his state of mind who is like that. He received the same education than all other students. He is brilliant and shows vigor in the study of Buddhism. I never trained him. It's innate at home. In Kyaukse, I did not have to go out for the meal offerings, so I had all the time to study. But in Mandalay, I had to go out every morning with my bowl for the meal. It was hard to have a good meal. In Kyaukse, we helped each other when we had difficulties or that we were sick. But in Mandalay, when I got sick, I was alone and had to take care of me. Eight years later, I became a member of the Council of this monastery. same year, I wrote a book on meditation which was refused by censorship. In fact, the monk at the censorship office was close to the military. At that time, almost all Masters were worshiped by the military in power. This censor monk was not happy because I had criticized his Masters. So I published the book illegally. I used the pseudonym "Wirathu - My Soe Yein". Like the book has become a success, people knew me as "Wirathu - My Soe Yein". The Battle of Theravada. Those who read it respect me still. The idea of? ?the book came to me in 1993. I had seen a video on the meditation method at the Monastery of Tant Kyi Taung. So, I looked in the texts of the Buddhist canon to find out if what this monk said was consistent with the texts. Master's mistake from both Kyi Taung was breathing in meditation. When we breathe, we feel the air which touches the cavity of the nostril. And when one expires, we feel the air that touches the tip of the upper lip. What to do in meditation, it's concentrating on the air contacts. But the Master so much Kyi Taung was saying But the Master so much Kyi Taung was saying like cows, by making noise. Some roar like tigers, some scratch like monkeys, some crawl like snakes, and some giggle like chickens. This monk went to the United States to teach his method. I do not like it. It was not limited to our country. Foreigners might believe that's it, Buddhism, but it's wrong. His monastery has an annex in Los Angeles, called Azusa. When the book was published, the monk of both Kyi Taung sued me, but the monks supported me. I did not learn the intentions of Muslims than in 1997. Before, we closed our eyes, and it's only in 1997 that we opened them. They were pages typed and photocopied, therefore less readable with time. I read it in 1997. At the time, with my monk friends other Mandalay monasteries, we were still young Masters. And we went to the cemetery taking bus number 8 It was around 8 pm We had gone up on stools to deliver our speeches. They did not have a microphone. Without microphone, they had to scream. A young woman and a "kalar" had a date of love. So, they hit the "kalar". I was happy. His code name was "Myo Chit Thu": the patriot. To hide, they put on the monk's robe on the head and black glasses. And they called themselves by code names. It was in order to hide our identities to the secret services. If they had known who we were, they would have informed our Great Masters in the monasteries, and we risked expulsion. Wirathu said not to buy in Muslim shops, not to sell real estate to Muslims, even at a very good price, etc. These words could incite to hatred. That's why the government had banned these speeches. The sound of applause could reach the sky. At that time, people were afraid to applaud. Despite this, monks had dared to applaud, and the whole country was interested in us. That's how speeches nationalists have spread. Every summer he went to Kyan Khin to teach. After delivering two sermons, he knew that the authorities were going to stop him and indeed, secret services have come to question him. So he stopped his sermons and returned to Mandalay. These two sermons had been registered. The monks made copies and distributed them widely. In Mandalay, when he arrived, cassettes were already there. That's how it was known by everybody. When he became one of the leaders from Ma Soe Yein Monastery, the Grand Masters no longer forbade him to give sermons. Protect race and religion, it is not easy. It hurts the heart. Where are we going, the Burmese? The threat to Buddhism has reached the alert level. By force, there is less and less Buddhists and more and more "kalars". What does the government do ? Nothing ! In addition, Muslims live in our country, they are well established, they live on our land, they use our resources and they have all the rights. They could to be happy with that, right? It is not enough for them. They insult and assault our religion. I can not endure what they are doing to us. And you, the Venerables? No. So, listen to me. In a few days, I will make a decision. As soon as I give the sign of departure, be ready behind me. In the meantime, I have to plan like it should be, CIA way, Mossad, etc., an effective operation. Thus, we will be able to succeed our action. The 1997 riots in Mandalay did not have a leader. So we did not succeed. This time, I'm the leader! I will make sure that the "kalars" have nothing to eat./i> And I will also make sure that they no longer of place to live. It all started October 19, 2003 at approximately 5:30 pm and around 11 pm it was over. Muslim houses were burned. Muslims are dead. A monk has crossed on a motorcycle the village of Lapang while traveling at a religious holiday. The Muslims of Lapang went out and killed him. If this monk had not been murdered, I would not have been arrested. A dead monk was serious. They feared let the whole country rise up. They stopped us to prevent a big move in the country. The international community, the UN and the Muslim countries lobbied on the government. The soldiers were scared. They arrested and imprisoned random people. They arrested me by accusing me to have everything engineered and orchestrated these conflicts. He was imprisoned because of me. At the same time as me. In prison, he was a Muslim who made food for Wirathu. He asked him what he wanted then asked the guards the ingredients and cooked them. Being a Muslim, he did not know the ritual of offering the meal, then it was others who offered it to him. Ce musulman m'a dit that his relationship with Wirathu was friendly. They talked rather of things to laugh and they were talking about everything except religion. It is said that the prison is "the university of life". We can learn a lot, there are many subjects. In prison, I practiced meditation for 99 months. This is the reason for my serenity: the concentration I gained. There is another book of me translated into English. Its title is : The Guilty of History. I wrote it in jail. I wrote about behavior of the Monks Council and their corruption. In short, I pointed that this Council of Monks was the armed arm of the military government. I started it the "Safran Revolution" of 2007. It's thanks to a memory that I wrote in prison that the revolution broke out. No. The "Safran Revolution" of 2007 has not been implemented by one person. And she was not made by a specific person. It was to liberate the whole country that the whole religious body had worked. Among the leaders, there were five, including myself. It was because the cost of living very high. We did not manage. We, the monks, knew that it was the government's fault. We decided to sing the Metta Sutta outside. We went to the residence from Aung San Suu Kyi. We surprised the authorities. We entered in the area easily before they stop us the road. We were sad to see her under house arrest, but happy to see her. She too was lucky to be able to pay tribute to us. We could recite the Metta Sutta. The government attacked the monasteries. It's the first time in history that the government attacked the monks, while we had demonstrated peacefully. We knew that outside, the revolution had begun. We had news by those who visited to the prisoners. We were really happy. And people told me that this was happening according to the memoir I wrote. They had a lot of respect for me. Someone in power came to see me He asked me to write a letter to the monks to stop demonstrating. Even if he had promised me to free myself, I would never have written this letter, I would never have accepted. My dear fellow monks, I am happy that you have come to welcome me. Thank you of your warm welcome. So, do you prefer a yellow speech, a monk's speech, or a bright red speech, to know a courageous speech? A bright red speech! Okay. For Theravada Buddhism, the new monastery Ma Soe Yein must be a bulwark. He must be an army from which fighters are born who fight in the first row. We, the monks, we always open our eyes Population. In Burmese politics, these are always the monks who guide. To show our greatness, we will write a new page. When I was released from prison, the movement 969 has grown. I planned the project stickers in prison, all alone. It took me 8 years. Seeing these stickers, they think of Buddha. Muslims possess a lot of shops. Big companies like Motherland, Naing Group, Shine Group, control big markets construction. All Muslims. that's why we give instructions not to buy among Muslims, because with the money they earn, they can marry Burmese girls. Then, they will invade the whole country. A central claim extremist monks is that the Muslim population develops without control. Census results do not confirm it at all. From the time of colonization speak English until 2012, all who ruled our country were bad. They did not care of national security. that's why over a million Bengalis have crossed our borders illegally. They want to seize Rakhine. Everything broke on June 8, 2012. The Muslim leader. They are Muslims who have just come out of the mosque. Look, they have stones! They have picks! He is a Buddhist filming. He filmed from his window. When the kalars saw it, they threw him pebbles. Even so, he continued to film. So the kalars have pushed the doors and entered. At this moment, he escaped with his wife. Then they set fire to his house. I arrived after. It's him who gave me these videos. When we arrived, there was still smoke. Muslims burned eight villages in one day. I did a trick to see the places where there were fires. I found that it was still more serious than I imagined. I was very affected. In fact, in Maungdaw, riot had begun with rape and murder of a young Buddhist by three Muslims. And, ten Muslim pilgrims were killed by Buddhists. June 3, 2012 ... June 3, 2012, ten Muslim pilgrims were returning to Rangoon by bus. Arrived at Toungup, a crowd of Buddhists took them off the bus and killed them. The riot is gone from the mosque to Maungdaw, but in Sittwe, they are Buddhists who started. When the riots took place, I went to film them then I broadcast widely these videos. People realized of the situation and that they had to protect our religion. This is how the 969 movement has taken off. To President Thein Sein ... Good health! To President Thein Sein ... Good health! Good health! To President Thein Sein ... Good health! - That our country ... - Be protected! Protect our country! Even the Buddha did of politics for peace. I want to declare here clearly that the Buddhist doctrine does not mention that religious do not have to do politics. - The Rohingyas ... - We do not want it! - The Rohingyas ... - We do not want it! - The Rohingyas ... - We do not want it! I remember talking with a young monk in Rakhine State in 2012. He was writing the first pamphlet calling the population to exclude economically, politically and socially Muslims. And he told us that Muslims posed a threat to his culture and for his country, and that he had the impression that all Rakhine Muslims were essentially terrorists or members d'organisations terroristes. When there will be too many Muslims, there will be troubles and "jihads". It's to prevent all that we are acting now. We can live with all kinds of people, with all the people of the world. But the Muslims here are like animals. They are violent and go on the attack. After the first wave of violence, we have described how Buddhist communities of Rakhine were organized. For many months, they had large meetings on the village squares. In Rathedaung, a big number of people have met and have developed, in fact, a platform ethnic cleansing. We tried to sound the alarm at the time, to tell the diplomats, at the UN, the media, what was preparing. We were very worried that violence increases. And, of course, in October 2012, another wave of violence, much more coordinated, hit. This time it touched 14 of the 17 cantons of Rakhine State. This obeyed a plan: the Buddhists were setting fire to Muslim houses, and when the Muslims, Rohingyas for the most part, were trying to extinguish those fires, the police and other security forces remained motionless. Arakanese Buddhists have all the powers and all the posts. They agreed to try to scare the Rohingyas. Muslims have small houses. Their houses burned, they can get some bigger ones. It is to get international aid they burn their own homes. The bottom of the problem, when people say that the Rohingyas burn their homes, it's not only that they say it and repeat it, but they sincerely believe it. With this second wave of violence, more than 140,000 people have been confined in more 40 internment camps. Before 1962, we had the right to vote. There were Rohingyas elected to Parliament. We could have jobs. We were in the army, police, immigration. There were teachers, doctors. We were also part of the public service. We are first and foremost human being. It's the responsibility of the government to protect the rights of people. There has never been a Rohingya ethnic group in history. The Rohingyas invented their name to hide their identity "Bengalie". 01: 01: 17,680 -> 01: 01: 18,715 At that time, Ziaur Rahman, President of Bangladesh, demanded to repatriate them. It was a setback for Burmese generals: they could not realize their plan, because those Rohingyas had national identity cards. Because of that, they were forced to take them back. The generals then introduced, in 1982, the law of citizenship to exclude them from the nationality. What is curious in the citizenship law, it is that it establishes that the government can decide which breeds are Burmese and which are not. I remember a discussion with a nationalist leader Arakanese. He said to me, "We can not exterminate the Bengalis ", that's what he called the Rohingyas. "We can not neither exterminate nor expel them, "They're too many. "But we can not either live with them. " In reality, their mosques are not places of worship like our monasteries. These are bases of war to plan attacks against non-Muslims. I guessed the intention of Muslims, who wants to convert the whole world to Islam. Moreover, we can see on YouTube, when the members of the El behead a Christian, they show a finger, that is to say: there must be one God in the world. Because Muslims enter and settle in the countries of Europe, they invade the world. And leaders like Merkel and Co. accept them regardless in the opinion of the people. To USA, if the people wants to stay in peace and security, he must choose Donald Trump. Once we had made people believe that the Rohingyas were the enemies of the Burmese nation, it was easy to expand this idea to all the Muslims of Burma like enemies. The word race in Burmese comes from a word pali, "kula". But this word "kula" is often employed with another word, "rakhita", which means "protection". This word, "kula rakhita", becomes "myo chit", "patriotism". But what the Buddha wanted to teach is not that everyone protect his race. When the Buddha speaks to protect the race, it means protecting all humanity. If there are two merchants, a Burmese and a kalar, where do we buy? At a Burmese. Between a Buddhist and a Muslim, which one should we choose? A Buddhist. When I'm not alive, around the year 2100, the white territory will become the black territory, and our religion will be dominated by the religion of the black flags. When I arrived in Meiktila, I was told this: a Muslim, the owner of the NLD office prevents to organize a prayer. Suppose he becomes a leader of a political party, a leader of the country or a member of parliament ... Think carefully. It's very serious, this case. The more you think, the more scary it is. Push yourself, please. Stay away a little . Put your weapon! Put your weapon. The riot started by a simple dispute in a Muslim jewelry store where a Buddhist had come sell a gold bracelet. I knew that people were trying to destroy the jewelry. So, I looked for someone I knew in the crowd. I asked if there were any monks and they said yes. So I spoke with this monk on the phone. These monks were there to prevent people to destroy everything. But there were so many people that no one has heard us. Demolish everything! Do not excite them anymore. It's bad. Let him die. I ask you to cooperate so that these conflicts do not spread and to protect the inhabitants of Meiktila. I hope you'll help us. We'll meet and create an association for protect race and religion. There will be officials, monks and locals. We will protect life and the property of the people of Meiktila. The aggressors are you from your neighborhood? Yes. There were people from the neighboring street. They were Buddhists. When we were hidden in the ditch, people have come shouting slogans. "We are the masters, we Burmese, "eradicate the Muslims." They had sticks and swords and they cut off all those who were on their way. So, there are no more Muslims in the city of Meiktila? No, not at all. What we do has nothing to do with W. We do not say the same thing and do not act like him. The Buddha says it takes observe and analyze speech He says you do not always have to to believe in his sermons. It's not because he told them that you have to believe it. It's not because he is the Master who must be believed, but in the contrary, we must live his words before accepting them. Without an organism, an excited crowd can become uncontrollable. It can explode. MA BA THA intervenes when kalars bother Buddhists. Once the problem is solved and sanctioned kalars, the crowd is calm. This is the role of MA BA THA. 969 had no structure, it was just a movement. There was not appointed officers and status, while MA BA THA is an organism well structured with leaders, central committees, regional committees. There are ten monks, including some monastic advisers and 15 lay people, who work there. There are those who film during events and those who distribute DVDs. We do not market our reports. For videos on jihad, we consider that everyone must know. So we offer DVDs. The video is called: The Black Days . One of my students did it. We have restored and filmed life this rakhine girl before she is murdered. It was shot exactly according to confessions of the three Muslim culprits. She was raped, slaughter, then we cut off his ears to take his curls and his jewels. We have not distributed yet The Black Days . We finish the editing and subtitling. Subtitling in English. It's Master Wirathu who has the rights. On social networks, Wirathu has millions of followers. People post things about him, true and false. These photos, they make you laugh. There is no problem. As for the false news on blogs, that presents a problem because the provincials really believe in it and can react. No organism, no NGO, could not intervene to prevent them. Security forces did not dare to act either. They were looking at each other's arms. We went there to control the situation. We were 200 to protect people staying two nights on the spot. Calm down all of you. Be peaceful. I do not know exactly what happened. I accept what you say. But you have to be sure. We are here at home. They arrive and insult us. There were no big problems. It was in the city center. Despite that, there was a death on each side. Whenever there are conflicts, we try to make sure that this does not spread. We will see in mosques to dialogue. According to Buddhism, we must use the gentle method. As soon as there is violence, Buddhism is destroyed. The laws on the protection of nationality must be voted Wirathu had many speeches to vote the laws on protection of race and religion. And this immense deployment of means indicates that there was a lot of money. Where did the money come from? That nobody knows. No doubt "cronies", a group of millionaires which evolves in the military sphere to get contracts, etc. Because of their cunning, girls innocent people have problems. - Is not it? - Yes. When there will be these laws, the Muslims can not more pretending to be Burmese to take our girls. We succeeded to vote these laws. If a Muslim wants to get married with a Buddhist, he must not convert it. If he does, he will go to jail. And then, for a Muslim, only one wife. No polygamy. Otherwise the prison. For Muslims, not many children. One child every 3 years. No more. We succeeded to introduce these laws. Now we are relieved for the future of our country. These laws could to be considered by the UN like a recoil in the process of reforms. An organization like the UN does he have the power to control the authority of our country? Yes or no ? No ! It's up to us to create the destiny of our country. Okay ! We will not give this power to the kalars. No ! Neither to the Chinese either. No ! And to the English? No ! And to the Americans? No ! Will we accept this situation ? No ! Without studying anything, this damn woman says that does not respect human rights. Is this woman honest? No ! Do you think you are important? In our country, you are just a whore. You can sell your ass to kalars, but you will not sell our Arakan. Wirathu risks a lawsuit, luck turns to Ma Ba Tha This is an incomparable opportunity to accomplish a historic project. Subtitling: Eclair Media and Aur?lie-Shama THIBAUDEAU :-) Love you Vicky
