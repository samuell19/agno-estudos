Pelosi: So how do you feel about what-- how the elections have evolved and the amount of money that's going into these elections? - I have no problem at all with the amount of money, 'cause the amount of money that goes into elections is peanuts.

Well, guess what. $11 billion was spent on-- let me look it up here, make sure I get it right-- oh, yeah, on smut. $11 billion was spent-- spent on smut. I think it was $18 billion was spent selling beer. So when $3.6 billion was spent in all the election campaigns in 2014 across our country and $11 billion is spent buying pornography, it kind of puts things in perspective, doesn't it? Oh, I--I'm sorry. Beer was $83 billion, not $18 billion. So what is more important? Selling lipsticks or letting people have freedom of speech to get their message out and say what they believe? - But people feel like the billionaires are just buying votes. - Well, they're made to feel that way, and it isn't true. Pelosi: I still can't believe that there are no benefits to giving; I'm trying to get to the benefit of what-- - Well, you know, some people give money 'cause they want political clout, they want to have help, they want somebody on Capitol Hill--I mean, I just hate it. I have never, ever asked a politician, from either party, to do something to help me, and I never will. Now, because I help people, can I get in and talk to them when somebody else might not? Sure. That's human nature. Pelosi: What do you talk to them about? - Well, I might talk to them about, uh-- I might talk to them about why don't we have a right to work law in Minnesota. Should have. Most labor people are for it. Pelosi: You get access. - Yeah, I do. There's no question about it. - But the voters are the suckers. They're just choosing between two flavors of the people that you guys selected to be the candidates. - You can put your name on the ballot. You can run for office, put your name on the ballot.

So people said to us, "Thanksgiving must be pretty interesting, uh, "if your brother's supporting John McCain, "your sister's supporting Barack Obama and you're supporting Hillary Clinton." Pelosi: And which one became the secretary of commerce? - Well, I don't think any of us anticipated becoming a secretary of anything, but, uh-- but certainly my sister became the secretary of commerce in the second term of President Obama. Pelosi: Because she had the smarts to support him from the beginning. - Well, I would say she supported him from the beginning, and that certainly played a big role in it. I don't know about the smarts part because I think I supported the right candidate when I supported Hillary Clinton. [car horns honking] Pelosi: Washington is full of billionaires who all have their own agendas, and by making campaign contributions, they can get in to meet with anyone. [indistinct chatter] Pearl: I'm not trying to do something to get more power or to get more money or to get more influence. I'm trying to do things to help create more peace in the Middle East, for instance, today. [indistinct chatter] Pelosi: Do you donors have access because you're a donor? Pearl: I think I have more access because I'm a donor. The thing is, I can call any Democratic congressman or most of the senators and say I want a meeting or I want a call or I want to talk about something, you know? And get my calls returned or get meetings inside. Even people with a few tens of thousands of dollars to spend get a lot of access, maybe not that much influence, but a huge amount of access, which most Americans just don't have. - Thanks. - Congressman, thank you very much. We really appreciate the work that you do. If you're the kind of person who can spend $20,000, $30,000 a year in politics, you can meet with anybody you want. I think most of these people are not corrupt in a sense of, "Oh, there's a quid pro quo." "I'm not gonna do something because some guy who donated money doesn't like it." It's more the fact that they never even hear from the other side. They only hear from the people sort of inside their world, and the people inside their world, after a while, tend to be the people that show up at fundraisers. You don't get poor people traveling to Washington and putting on fancy suits and meeting with their Congress representatives. You get rich people or people hired by rich people, even. man: Once, Nancy Pelosi was safely confined to liberal San Francisco Pelosi: So where does all the money from these rich donors go? Most of it into attack ads like this... Obama: Would necessarily skyrocket. Pelosi: To destroy a politician's name. man: Pelosi has grown into a power-hungry goliath defying the will of the American people. Who has the power to stop her? Who can save America? Vote May 18th, the day we fight back! RightChange is responsible for the content of this message. Pelosi: So why did you make that ad? - I happen to be a big believer in individual responsibility. It's not up to somebody else to take care of you. It's up to you to take care of yourself. Pelosi: You've--you've tried to buy an election. Did it work? - [laughs] That's like, "Have you stopped beating your wife?" There's no answer to that. [laughing] Pelosi: Have you stopped beating your wife? - I never started. Pelosi: Just had to make that clear. - Yup. Okay. Pelosi: When you give money, it says, "Big pharmaceutical guy writes big check to candidate." If you're giving millions of dollars to Republicans to make attack ads, there must be something in it for you. - Yeah, and then you'd say "Well, where's the bright-line test on that?" There isn't one because it's nonsense. Pelosi: How much of your own money have you put into campaigns? - Since the beginning of time, or... Pelosi: Sure. - I don't know the exact number, but it's in the millions anyway. Pelosi: So you all say you're giving millions and you're not getting anything out of it, right? It's just for the good of America? - Mm-hmm. Pelosi: But you're making people hate their politicians. You're funding a nuclear war of attack ads against each other. - I don't think any of us are engaged in a nuclear war against each other. We may be engaged in a fistfight over our respective belief systems. But I know that I can argue vociferously with some of my friends about issues and then we go out and play ball or have a beer or whatever you're gonna do. I mean, come on, this is the United States of America. That's what--that's how our system's set up. Now, it gets ugly. I'll give you that. [dramatic music] man: If you have any question about what John Kerry's made of, just spend three minutes with the men who served with him 30 years ago... - I served with John Kerry. - I served with John Kerry. - John Kerry has not been honest about what happened in Vietnam. - He is lying about his record. - John Kerry betrayed the men and women he served with in Vietnam. - He dishonored his country. He most certainly did. - I served with John Kerry. John Kerry cannot be trusted. man: Swift Boat Veterans for Truth is responsible for the content of this advertisement. - "Boone, thank you for your support. "We'd go down any canal with you any day. "Swift Boats and Prisoners of Wars for the Truth." Pelosi: Why did you put so much of your own money towards making George Bush president? - I didn't want John Kerry. [chuckles] It's that simple. The Swift Boat deal, I think, won the election in 2004 for Bush. He may not feel that way, but I do. I think it did make the difference in who was president of the United States in 2004. And, uh, did I run in there and say, "Now this is what I'd like to have"? No, I never asked, uh, President Bush for one thing. Pelosi: But did George Bush make decisions that made you more money as an oil tycoon? - I can't think of anything he did that--that made me a dime. For instance, I tried to get the natural Gas Act passed. I'm in the oil and gas business. I've been in it for over 50 years. And I know that natural gas is cleaner, and I was trying to replace diesel for heavy-duty trucks, 18-wheelers. There's only two fuels that will move that 18-wheeler: diesel or natural gas. The natural gas freed up is directed to transportation needs of the country. The natural gas is cheaper, cleaner than gasoline, and its supplies is plentiful, and most of all, it's American. It went to the Senate. It was an amendment to the transportation bill, and we got 51 votes-- 45 Democrats and 6 Republicans. That was a real eye-opener to me-- after all the time I spent with the Republicans, that I--I was-- I got only six votes. But I had against me the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers had other reasons for wanting diesel instead of natural gas. Pelosi: So do you think the Koch brothers' political activism is based on their bottom line? - I can't say that for sure. I think-- I think the Koch brothers are sincere, uh, conservative people. If it fits the bottom line, fine. But, you know, they could turn around today if they were sitting here and say, "Well, wait a second." "If you had gotten natural gas for heavy-duty trucks, it would've helped your bottom line too." That's true. It would've helped my bottom line. I have a big interest in a company that is in that business. Pelosi: Wait, so you spent your whole life writing checks to Republicans and then you wanted to get some law passed and they all voted against it? - Yes. You got it right. Pelosi: So you're basically telling me democracy is not for sale. - In this case, I think they had a better bidder. I think the Kochs had--had more, uh, influence than I did. Pelosi: Do you think that your bill didn't pass because the Koch brothers outspent you? - I think they had more influence, and over time, sure, they outspent me. Pelosi: The Koch brothers own Koch Industries, which does business in oil and gas. They've put together a network of donors who have pledged to spend almost $1 billion in this election. Their political influence happens to benefit the fossil fuel industry, but they say they're only in this game because they don't believe in big government. So do they donate for virtuous, ideological reasons or because it's good for their bottom line? I don't know. They turned down repeated requests for an interview. - Clean energy and climate have got to be more than an environmental issue. We think it's a way for Democrats to talk about our future. Pelosi: On the Democratic side, the biggest donor is billionaire Tom Steyer, who's fighting big oil. - Thank you very much. [applause] Pelosi: Steyer is very upfront about what he wants. He's an activist, putting his money to work to promote his cause. - I'm Tom Steyer. With bold leadership and an endless supply of wind and sun, we can do even more. Pelosi: Through his PAC, NextGen, he pumped $74 million into the last election for candidates who are committed to addressing climate change. - The goal is 50% clean energy by 2030. So what are we waiting for? - So let me just back up and say the mission was very simple. I wanted to make a movie about money in politics, so I went to OpenSecrets, and I looked up the list of mega-donors, and I wrote to the hundred biggest mega-donors in America. And you're at the top of the list. - You did not go to the list of mega-donors and go down the list according to who gave the most money. You went to the list of people who disclosed the money they gave. The big money in politics is dark money. It's money that you can't trace and where it isn't disclosed and where it shows up in the political system anonymously. And that's not me, and that's probably not the people who-- the bulk of the people who you called who see the system differently and see a real value to transparency and awareness. - So you're saying you are an ideological donor. Donor, donor. - Absolutely. Look. What we're doing is, we're trying to work as hard as we can on behalf of what we think of as traditional American values. We have no skin in the game from the point of view of our self-interest. We have skin in the game because we have a strong belief about what America stands for and what we should be doing as a country. But we're definitely, uh, people who are working as hard as we can on behalf of values. - So every single Republican that I interviewed names you as the bogeyman on the left. If the Koch brothers can put all this money into democracy, why are they demonized? - Look, the Koch brothers are acting in their self-interest. The Koch brothers are acting with as little transparency as they can get away with. We are acting completely transparently. We are not acting in our self-interest. They are Goliath. They are much bigger than us. They are much--they are gonna spend much more money than us. They are trying to do something very deliberate. And we--what we're doing, I think, is both transparent, it is not self-interested, and we understand, the only real things that we have on our side are truth and the underlying interests of the American people, who are the voters. So when I think about us versus the Koch brothers, I can't imagine something more different, to be honest. - Why are they spending all that money? - You'd have to ask them. I'm sure they were more than happy to talk to you because they're very transparent. Pelosi: No, they're not. The Koch brothers won't give me an interview. - Exactly! Pelosi: They said that they're spending $1 billion because it's their free speech right to give money, but they won't give me an interview to explain why they're giving the money. - The last thing they want to do is sit down with you, in front of a Sony camera, and explain exactly what they're doing. They're not gonna do it. Pelosi: So this is where our story turns, from the billionaires who claim they aren't getting anything in exchange for their donations to the corporations, unions, and advocacy groups, the so-called special interests, that contribute millions to campaigns with the sole purpose of getting something back. These donors aren't giving because they love America. They're contributing because they have a vested interest in the decisions that are made in Washington. Simmons: The story of money in politics isn't just about individuals writing checks to politicians. It's also about the special interest money in campaigns and in D.C. You know, special interests spend over $3 billion every year on direct lobbying. They spend another $3 to $6 billion every year on trying to influence our legislation. - Why do corporations put so much money into our elections? - Terrific return on investment. There was one tax break that-- where a group of corporations got together and they got a 22,000% return on investment, comparing their lobbying expenditures to the money they got to pocket afterwards. - You know, one of the things that when I think about my-- my donation, uh, if anything, it could be almost a stupid decision on my part, because really, these large, individual donations don't matter. There is a huge apparatus made up of money and people representing large corporations and other significant special interest groups that really drive what's going on in the country. - So you're telling me you wrote a $10-million check to Ted Cruz but you don't have any influence? - I'm telling you that my ability to influence what happens in Washington is not much different than someone writing a $100 check. What is disconcerting for me is, as I understand, that what I'm competing against is a apparatus set up in Washington by large corporations and special interests that drive not only what the legislation that is passed in the House and Senate but, just as importantly, after a law is passed, the rules around that law. That's what really sets the course of the country. - I think there is the belief that somehow the whole system in Washington is not on the level, that it's tilted against the ordinary citizen. And the reason people have that view is because they're right. It is tilted against the ordinary citizen. It does favor the rich. You know, when the bankruptcy bill was, uh, debated, the student loan indu--industry said, "Well, guess what." "If you're bankrupt, you still have to pay back your student loans." Um, really? Um, but I understand why that happened. The bankruptcy laws favor the banks. What a surprise. The banks had the money, had the lobbyists-- very effective, very talented lobbyists-- thankfully I was not one of them-- who argued in favor of making the bankruptcy laws very tough on consumers, difficult to discharge completely your debts and obligations. Well, that's a perfect example of how economic power made a very big difference then and in an ongoing fashion to the way our finances work in this country. Um, and it's true every single time the banks or the insurance companies want something. They have power; they have influence; they have lobbyists; they can, in many instances, determine the outcome of what happens here in Washington. Consumers, for example, have a much harder time. - A lot of business gives money to be protected from government. Big business doesn't have a party. Big business gives to both sides. Big business is not gonna give a whole lot more to one side than they give to the other side. That's just kind of a big business tree. In 1997, I was asked to go to, uh, Washington, out near Seattle, to meet with Bill Gates. The general counsel of Microsoft had decided they needed to hire some lobbyists. Tom Downey, who is a former Democrat congressman-- very, very good guy-- and I, as a Republican, we were the two guys that he asked to come out and meet with Gates. We're sitting there, and Gates is, you know, kind of not real comfortable, and finally he says to the lawyer, whose name also happened to be Bill, he said, "Bill, I don't know why we would want to spend $600,000 a year on lobbying." He said, "There's not anything I want the government to do for me." And his lawyer said, "Well, y'all want to answer the question?" And I said, "Yeah, Bill", "you don't want the government to do anything for you, "but this is about trying to make sure the government doesn't do anything to you." And there are a lot of businesses whose idea is, whether through taxation, through regulatory policy, through various and sundry other government actions, that they don't want to get the government after 'em. And for the most part, these businesses want to give and have good people in public office because they don't want to get hurt by the government. ["Hail to the Chief"] [patriotic orchestral music] [siren wailing] ♪ ♪ Pelosi: As ironic as it may sound, there's a new group of mega-donors who throw fundraisers to raise money to get money out of politics.

Pelosi: How much money do you think the Soros family, altogether, has given to the political system? - Uh, I mean, the-- the biggest numbers were spent starting in 2004. I think that was $27 million. That was the big number. That was the number that sort of made my father's reputation as a political donor. - The Republicans keep saying, you know, "How is what George Soros does" any different than what David Koch does?" - So people on the left will argue that it's different because George Soros is fighting for all that's good and right and David and Charles Koch are fighting for their own interests. What you're hearing is, like, they're out to destroy America for themselves and they just want to destroy our environment so that they can continue polluting, and that's the story. Let's take as an argument that actually what they're interested in is the same thing as what the people on the left are interested in, which is the success of American society based on their view of the way it should be. If you take that argument, there is really no difference. Um-- - And what's wrong with that? - Well, what's wrong with that is that it's a fundamentally undemocratic way to affect the outcome. Right? Not--it's-- what's wrong with it is not your--is not your desire, your belief, your--your motive; what's wrong with it is the--is the method. - So there is a whole new movement of people that are coming to this, "We got to get the influence of money out of politics"? - There is. It's a slow-growing movement. It's slower than we would like. Right now, the major-- the vast majority of the money that funds elections comes from a miniscule fraction of the American public that is giving, uh--giving large checks to Super PACs but also giving the large checks to campaigns. - But just because you take a check from someone doesn't mean you're gonna vote their way. - May not be true, right? Sometimes it will be true. Maybe--you know, but even if it's not true, that perception is now ingrained in the American public. They believe that that's true. Poll after poll shows that people-- that elected representatives are more likely to represent the interests of their donors than the ordinary voters. You have to create an alternative path so that a candidate can run a viable campaign not going after rich people, actually getting the money either, you know, in a--in a public financing system, the way that it worked for 40 years for electing presidents, from Jimmy Carter through George W. Bush, or from ordinary folks giving small contributions and maximizing them so that it actually becomes enough money to run a campaign, right? There needs to be a path for a candidate who says, "I'm--I'm gonna run without relying on rich people." Right, we need our democracy to be more than an argument among rich people who are supporting their-- you know, their own candidates.

You know, it's not a situation where you have a government by the people and for the people. You have a government by a few people for the benefit of a very few people, and it's going to take campaign finance reform to change that. Pelosi: Can we call this a democracy? - Of course not. When you have, you know, the 1% giving this kind of money to campaigns, that's not a democracy. That's why you've got to have campaign finance reform, and that's why there's got to be public financing with limits on what a campaign can, uh, solicit from individual donors. Pelosi: So if it's not a democracy, what is it? - Well, it's a plutocracy. It's a government that is organized and run by a few, and those few are the ones who write the biggest checks.
