GOTO Kumiko YOSHIDA Eisaku FUJITANI Miki MANDA Hisako TSUGAWA Masahiko Director DEME Masanobu I'm home. Welcome home. Why didn't you go to the piano lesson? I went to a fencing lesson by mistake. And you're supposed to be home by seven o'clock. The cram school was longer than usual today. Please call us if you'll be late. Yes. The Girl in Glass Ouch. I'm sorry. Do you always use this locker? Do you go to Seiwa Junior High School? Don't you have strict rules? Do you hide your uniform here and go play? I won't tell anyone, so can you keep this here? Steamed potatoes? Yeah... something like that. I have to go to work now and can't take this with me. I'll finish work at nine. Meet me here at 9:10, OK? I thought Father was coming home today, right? It's an election year so he needs to visit many places. That man has become a bureaucrat. Please study hard pr I'll be the one who'll get into trouble. Please don't call Father "that man" in front of me. I'm sorry. I'm used to calling him... that way. When you were his secretary, you called him "Sir," right? I married your father for you. I'm the only one who can raise you to be a great woman. That's what he said when he proposed to me. He married me for you. Didn't you love Father? I wouldn't have married him just because I loved him. I could have spent more time with him if I remained as his sectary. Is that how it goes? Mr. Eto is here. Please be nice to Madam. She's doing her best. You're on her side, too? Miss... What was my mom like? She was beautiful. You always say the same thing. Please bring his clothes with you. Sure. When will Father come home? He was supposed to come home from Hokkaido today, but he had to go to Kansai. He'll come home next week. Please tell him to call me. Sure. I'm sorry. I can't wait... I'll take it home. Idiot! Why did she take it home? Idiot! He's such a kid. How silly... Darn! Eat this. I already ate at work. What? Money? Don't worry about money. Eat first. Have you seen a key around here? A key? Did you lose it? I guess... Where? If I knew where I dropped it, I'd go get it. Where is the gun? It's at a safe place. Go get it now. Well... I can't. Why not? Don't worry. If someone finds it, I'll have to go back to the Philippines. Nobody will send you home. You said you didn't want to go back when our factory closed down so I found this job for you. Your visa has expired. Who's helping you with money? Thank you. Thank you so much. Yasuko. What a pretty dress. Is it a designer brand? Yup. I want to buy one, too. Where did you buy it? Forget it. It'll look inexpensive if you wear it. Excuse me... We're told not to talk to men so... Excuse us... You're home. You were OK... Is there something to eat? We have ramen noodles. How is Jose? I haven't seen him for a while. Did you find a job? No. Mom was worried. Ed, Sanchez, and Jose have been working hard. If Dad was here we'd have been OK... It's not Mom's fault. All steel factories aren't doing well. Don't talk so much. Make some noodles... You better decide what you want to do. You graduated from high school, so you need to find a job to help Mom. After I graduate from junior high school, I'll go to nursing school. You always say the same thing... Idiot! Thanks for waiting. You're late. Yasuko. Try harder. Who knows the answer? Miss Okinaka. The best way to see around is from the top of the bus. Next... You translate this. Big Ben... Yes... I visited Big Ben... stool. Give me back my stuff. I didn't bring it today. Did you see it? Where is it? It's at home. I'll go there with you so please return it to me. Hurry up. Who are you? I don't know him. He walked me home to make sure that I'd be safe. Thank you, but please don't do this again. I came here to take care of some business with her. What kind of business? Let me hear it. Are you her sister? No. I'm her mother. I don't need to talk to Mom. Hello. What's going on here? I don't know who you are. I don't need to talk to her. Wow. She's a princess. Because you're flirting, a guy like him comes to you. Mr. Sasaki will come here to tutor you during the summer. I'm going to Nasu with Father for a week. I don't know if he'll have time this summer. He always spends a week with me during summer break. You need to act like a Diet member's daughter. We all have to be good. Is getting remarried acceptable? It's because your mother passed away. Why don't we have her altar here? Your father is thinking about you. No. He is thinking about you. You have a phone call. Please transfer it here. No. This is for Miss Yasuko. Father is calling me? Hello. This is Yasuko. You'll be back tomorrow. Dinner together? I'm looking forward to seeing you. We're having a party! Chicken, fried rice, soup, and dessert. A full course meal. Eat first. Eat more. We can't see the stars. The air isn't clean here. The South Cross. What's that? The South Cross. It's the star we can see in the Philippines. Do you want to go back to the Philippines? No. I can't find a job there. When you eat and see the stars, your immigration problem seems so insignificant. Yasuko. Wait. Here is the guy again... I'll report to school. No. He's actually my cousin. See you later. Give it back now. I forgot it at home. I'm sorry. Give me a break. That's my lunch box. Go get it now. Is that a real gun? My friend is a bit... He goes crazy when he doesn't have it. Don't be embarrassed. I know it's just a toy. Come with me. I'll show you something interesting. I can't... I have plans tonight. Cancel it. No, I can't. He's a great man. OK. It'll be done by evening. It smells like the ocean. Wait here. Act crazy... You want the gun back, right? She thinks it's a toy, so she doesn't want to return it to us. She's strange... Strange? Anyway, tell her you're going to die without it... Hey... Strange...? I've never been under the sun. I always had to wear a hat even at the beach. All I did was look at the watch. Oh, really. She's strange. Tell her. Return it to me. He's the one... If you catch me, I'll give back the toy. What did she say? If we catch her, she'll return the toy to us. So...? OK. Tell her OK. What should we do? Scare her a little. Go. Wait. Do you two play like this every day? Yes. Right, Jose? His name is Jose? Do you go to the same school? Yes. So you skip school every day? Yes. What do you do every day? Play cowboy with toy guns? No. We're not kids. Is that real? No. It's just a toy. Then I'll treasure it. OK? Welcome home. Where is Father? He's in the back. Where have you been? Anyway, go see Father. At your district, your competitor is the man who has helped me in the past... so I told Morishita that I'd help the son now. Then he asked me to write what I promised... Why not? You haven't said hello to your father yet? Hi. You look well. Have you been listening to Mom? Welcome home. Good evening. Good evening. Hello, Miss. You've grown up a lot since I saw you last. Satoko, please call Mr. Eto. Sure. A group leader is waiting for you over there. Please start first. Sure. I better go now. Talk to you later. Are you going to take time off this summer? Summer vacation? You promised you'd teach me how to ride horses. This session will last longer... so. Oh, horse riding... I can't make it because of meetings. You're too young. Besides, if you get hurt... You're a liar. Yasuko. How are your studies going? I'll make sure that you get into the school, anyway... but don't embarrass me. Do you understand? Get ready for a bath. Sure. Yasuko, would you like to take a bath with me? You've grown too old to take a bath with me anymore... It's real... Hey, have you seen a guy who used this locker here? I don't know. Welcome home. Where is your report card? I'll bring it later. It's pretty good. Are you feeling OK? Tell me the truth. Did you see that guy again? No. You told your friends that he's your cousin, didn't you? No. Tell me the truth. Robbery at supermarket. Arrested on site for firing a gun. Investigating on the origin of the gun. They needed money badly... I give up... Don't worry. I know they won't confess that easily. What should we do? Don't go to the shed for a while. Stay here, OK? How about the girl? Don't worry. She thinks it's a toy... so it's safe. It's dangerous. If someone finds out, she'll be in trouble. I know. Yoichi. I'm going to work now. What's wrong with you? Nothing. I'm asking around if there are any jobs for you. We'll find something. So, hang in there. Comments, please... You want it back, don't you? We gave up... treasure it. You know it's a toy. Please take care of it. You can take that thing back. That thing? I can go out in the afternoon. So meet me at three at the planetarium. I told you I don't need it... Idiot! Where have you been? Mr. Sasaki called and he'll be here at three. What? That's no good... It's your job to study... It's pass three o'clock now. She's a liar. Be quiet. Such nice weather... Please read. A hateful thing. It's the visitor who lingers when you're in a rush. Read more slowly. This is a classic poem. This is Okinaka. Who called...? Nobody. Your father and I are going to the wedding tonight so please stay home. Please serve a cold drink and get ready for tonight. Sorry, Yoichi. What's wrong with you? Let's talk at the police station. Sure. Sorry. I couldn't go... Oh, this is Okinaka. Are you Mrs. Okinaka? Yes...? This is Kugahara Hospital. Please tell Mr. Okinaka to come to the Hospital. Sorry. I was busy. Who called? It was a wrong number. Please don't tell the Madam about this. I was told not to let you answer the phone. Kugahara hospital... Mr. Okinaka is home. Welcome home. Is Yasuko awake? A chef wanted to make you sushi. Please be careful. Can you give me a kiss? Father... I need to talk to you. Father... I knew you'd be there. I'm such an idiot for waiting for you for two days. Thank you for coming with me today. Where are we going? I'm scared to go alone. Tell me where we're going. Ms. Okinaka. Stop... How pretty... I'm Yasuko. I'm Okinaka Yasuko. No... My Yasuko is a baby. Let's go back to your room. Excuse us... She'd better go now. Good-bye. Hey. Don't look at me. I'll walk ahead of you so follow me. You can't even walk...? Here... I don't know what happened, but don't be so sad. Was I heavy? My arms and legs are shaky, and I'm very hungry. Did you eat enough? I'm full. I'll finish it for you. Those are my chopsticks... So...? Oh, nothing. May I have another one? It was really fun at the place. Where? You know the shed... May I visit there again? I think I'll keep it. You don't mind, right? There are things that you don't want to know... I was waiting for the right time to tell you, so... Do you know why I didn't tell you about your mother? Have you thought about that? You should have... I'm very sorry. You don't have to apologize. You couldn't have married Father unless my mother was dead. Otherwise, it'd have been a scandal. Right? It was better for you, too. Your mother wasn't capable of being your mother or the diet member's wife anymore. I am still taking care of your mother. What's wrong with that? She was just a bad luck to you? It was unfortunate for your mother to be married to me. She isn't without time. You need to think positively in life. What's the meaning of life? How could you say that? Leave her alone. Dear Father, I've followed your rules until today, but something has happened in me. I'm confused. I'm disappointed that we don't have time to talk. Please let me have time alone to think. Please... Good-bye. I have something to tell you. Don't say anything. Come with me. We're real, too. Right? I'm dizzy. Rest. I don't want to sleep tonight. What's wrong? Are you cold? The stars are beautiful. You can see it better. Do this... Help me. Not all of them. Don't worry. I won't do anything. OK. What did Jose do? His visa expired and now he's an illegal worker. You'll be in trouble, too. I don't care about me, but you know he'll starve if he goes back to his country. He also refurbished a gun. Jose doesn't do that kind of things. Your son made him do it. I don't believe you. Is it true? Good morning. You've never cooked before? Yes. I learned how to cook at school. Do you expect to get married...? My husband will cook for us. I don't want a wife who doesn't know how to cook. Oh, I see. Teach me. I'll learn how to cook. This is the best shelter. I know. We haven't used this place for a long time... Yoichi... Nobody believes us. That's fine with me. I could die with you. We can't find her anywhere ...not at her friends' house. Hospital. We better ask the police to search for her discreetly. No. The election is coming up so we better not... I have a bad feeling about this... Don't be silly. Yasuko is my daughter. I believe in her. I've raised her like my own daughter and sacrificed much. Our focus now isn't on you or your feelings, understand? You have a call from the police chief. Oh, the police chief... Is your daughter home? I heard your daughter was with the boy who's a gun dealer. We're still working on the case so... We don't know anything yet. I also heard that someone was at your summer house... so... Satoko. Yasuko is with a man. With a man? You're with her every day. Didn't you notice anything? It's your fault. You always blame me for everything. Go. Hurry up. Sir. Don't bother me. The freshwater fish is great to fry... Do you mean steamed fish? No. No. How do you know? You don't even know how to cook. It's common sense. What should we do? They're looking for me. Tell them you don't know anything. OK? No. You don't know anything. OK? Run. Please. I know a shortcut to the station from here. Hurry. It's our secret, OK? You're definitely Madam's daughter. Madam? Your birth mother. What do you mean? You're insensitive. My mother is a normal person. She was suffering, because she knew about father and you... She's not like me at all. I wouldn't have endured it. I don't care what anyone says. I can't stand this anymore. I failed as your mother now? Are you happy? I don't have any complaints. Even now? If you become a good girl... I don't think you're happy. You'll understand how I feel when you're older. You're not being honest. Jose said that Yasuko has it... so I can't do anything. Where is Hirota Yoichi? We haven't found him. Seems like he got alone with Yasuko a lot. Come back home with Yasuko now. How terrible... Where is it? You think it's a toy, but it's a real gun. You can't carry a gun in Japan. It's against the law. If you're caught with the gun... I'll have to resign... You could just say that you thought it was a toy. Give it to me. If someone finds it, you can't say you didn't know... Tell me where it is. I don't know. If you tell me where it is, I'll handle the situation. Is that the only thing that you wanted to ask me? Yes. Don't you want to know who Yoichi is? Stop. I don't want to hear about the guy. Come in. Hurry. Etsuko went to see Jose. I don't think they'll let her see him. I think they'll send Jose back to the Philippines. There is nothing we can do for him... No matter what you do, you'll always be my son. I want you to stay healthy... I know you want to help Jose, but you can't... Don't be so nice to me. I just wanted to earn money... Sorry. If our factory was still here, you wouldn't have to... Don't apologize. It's not your fault. I'm home. Brother. I have a favor to ask. Miss Miki is on the phone. Can I talk to her? I was told that you can talk to friends from school. Hello. I'm Yoichi's sister. Oh. I'm fine. Going to the beach? I better study... My brother will be waiting for you at the planetarium at noon. Thank you. Please say hello to Natsuko. Bye. My friends are going to the beach tomorrow. Why don't you go? You'll have to go in your father's car. Can you slop here for ten minutes? No. We aren't supposed to stop anywhere. Please. I just got my period. I want to be with you. We can meet again. Are you Hirota Yoichi? Run. Yasuko. Yoichi. Wait. Wait. Father, please help Yoichi. Help? You can work something out. Please help him. If I can't see him anymore, I'll kill myself. Father. Do you love him that much? You're my only daughter. I can't allow the guy to be with you. He's the only one for me. Sure. We can make a deal. Give me a kiss first. I'll help him. Tell me where you hid the gun first. That's not fair. I don't have any reasons to help him if you don't... Wait. I'll tell you... Please help him. Coffee for you. No, thank you. Let me speak with him. This is Mr. Okinaka. He'd like to speak with you. We found the gun. Yasuko told us where it was. She thought it was a toy. However, it doesn't matter. She'll be charged as well... Yasuko has nothing to do with it. Thank you. Would you go to the Philippines with Jose? Since you're Japanese, I'll give you an assignment to go. I'll guarantee the living expenses for you and your family. He's sparing you from going to the detention center. You should be grateful for his help. How about Yasuko? Yasuko will be fine. He's helping you out to be fair. Are you going to the Philippines? Jose is being deported because of you. Don't you think you should go with him as a friend? Yasuko said that she wouldn't see you anymore. You should move on and start a new life there. Will you go there? I'll go to the Philippines so that I can see the stars with Jose. Great. Thank you. Please forgive my brother. May I have my stuff? For me? It's important to have a good education... and family. We need to raise our children to be considerate to others. You must be the sister. My brother is leaving for the Philippines today. He told me not to tell you... but I feel sorry for him. Thank you. Yoichi. Why are you leaving me? Yasuko. Yoichi. Yasuko. Watch out. Yasuko. You didn't have to come here. I came here for you. Sorry for the trouble. I don't know what to say. Mom. The Minister of State Okinaka Sugitaro May I borrow your lighter? Hurry. Miss.... Don't bother me. The End
