It's been a long time. We don't have guys doing anything else. It's not that I don't like it, but bullfighting doesn't get me going. I feel something here I just breath pure emotion That's just silly No, I'm serious. It's fine, we don't all have to be the same. Chato, slide down. Look out! Look out! Hey, you're crazy.

It's no good Let's wait a bit, and if not, we'll do it We're not doing too well. She's pretty, isn't she? Wow, beautiful. And how are you? Hey, beautiful. You see that woman? (Unintelligible) Let's go. You take a good nap? No, I didn't rest a bit. Why do you drink so much coffee? Keep a good watch. If they're going to come out or if something's up, whistle loud. Don't worry. Just watch over here. You'll see that I'm fast. Hey good looking. What do you want to drink? Wine, for now. Coming up, half glass of red wine. Half a glass of red. Okay, two glasses. What are you doing here? You don't know about this place? I'm here for something, right? I figured as much. If you want, I'll leave. Because of me? The 20th of July What a bad day For the Gomez couple And for their daughter She was killed By the hands of a bad man Don Peli Lope Robledo (man's name) And he hasn't even confessed ... Let's see what you've got there. What do you think? Come inside. There it goes. Pretty, eh? Go for it, Juan! Ole! Ole! Come on, kid. This gets to you, Manolo? Hey, good afternoon, Don Esteban. Looks like you did a job on that cow. It must be tired from the heat. Hi Don Esteban. Hey, how are you? Do you have a moment to talk? Sure, what do you want? Don Esteban let me down. He said no. Yeah, we saw. What are you going to do now? Now? I don't know. But you're not going to leave Ricardo are you? I have to eat and bring money home Why don't we go somewhere else? Like to America? Why not? We don't have to stay here. I can't. I'm staying here. Do you know anything about America? Not much. They have everything, man Do you know anything about America? Not much. They have everything, man That's just what they say. Haven't you seen it? What do you know? What floor? To the top one. I'm going to the fourth. Now! That;s good enough. Okay. Look, look. Come on. Hey, you've got a pretty nice life, huh? Like the Americans. It's just fine, normal. They're pretty smooth. They'll shine. You seem like a playboy to me. Is that your life? Look, sweetie, maybe something like that. Come with me today. Here. Later. They'll see us. Here. Hey Antonio Juan! I'll be there in a minute, Antonio Hey, what's up Antonio? I talked to that guy about you. Can you do anything? You want a smoke? Not now, I'm beat. Try to come by. Sure. We can have a coffee. They're probably going to give me a shot this afternoon. Your brother was here a few minutes ago. He's looking for you. What did he say? DId he say anything about bullfighting this afternoon? No, nothing about that. He just asked about you and then he headed that way. You sure he didn't say anything? Yeah. Thanks. Chato! Chato! Hey, what's up? I'm ready. This afternoon I'm going to see that businessman. I'll go with you. I wonder how much he'll ask for. How much do you have? Nothing, just a little. We'll see. Maybe he'll agree to it just from seeing me. What do I know? We'll see. Maybe he'll agree to it just from seeing me. What do I know? 12.50, sir. That's how it works, kids. If you give it to me, I set everything up. But have you seen him bullfight? You can ask in Marte. He did a lot of amateur bullfights there. I've seen him bullfight. The kid's good. He knows what he's doing. Yeah, I know that the kid's good. But without money there's nothing we can do. For 2000 pesetas we could get things going. And if we don't, then what? Don't be in such a big rush. But I can work it out for you, maybe even with just 1000 pesetas. Well, so, what do you think? Let's go, Antonio. Since it's you guys, I'd do it for just 500. Come on. It went badly in the cafe. What a jerk. I couldn't believe it. I don't think there's anything we can do. The guy was a prick. He didn't even let us talk. Would you like to dance? Well… Come on, what do you think? Hello. This isn't the place for you. Go on little boy. Go home with your mommy. I just wanted to… Hey beautiful. Come on. Have you seen that girl? Don't screw with me. Hey, what's going on, Paco? Nothing. I was just asking her to dance. Just leave her. If you do things like me, you'll get the girls, just like that. You? You want something else to drink? I'm feeling great. I've got three more in me, and I want to dance with you. You want to dance? No, I don't feel like it. Ah, come on. No. You want to go get something to drink? Okay. [indecipherable small talk] Let's go to the bar. I'm buying. So, what are you going to do now? If things go well for me If I were in your place I wouldn't be too worried. Come by later for me. What can I get you gentlemen? Drink what you'd like. I'm not in the mood. Oh, just have something, man. Drink what you'd like. I'm not in the mood. Oh, just have something, man. What. Beer. Okay. Three bottles. It's all about the money. Without it, we can't do anything. I'm at my prime, Ramon. I want to bullfight! More than anybody. We'll have to do something. Do what? He's the same as Don Esteban. He just wants to get rich. We told him that I wanted to bullfight. That he could ask anywhere about me. But he said no. How much would you need? I don't know. They would know. I could come up with something. You? Another beer, please. You could do a job, Ramon. You and your friends. What friends. We'd have to do it ourselves. And we'd all have to be in agreement. But I don't know if Julian or Manolo or you want to take the risk. I don't mind. And to do it for Juan could work out great But, what are you all going to do. You all? No. WE. That's the first thing. And second, what we're going to do is really easy. Do you want a shot? Yes. Just a few afternoons that work out well and a little luck and we're good. You call Julian. Manolo! Manolo! I'm over here. Hey, Manolo. Wait, sir. Again next week. Look, Manolo. We've been thinking. Look, Manolo, we want to help Juan get his first big bullfight. We've been friends for a long time. He doesn't have anything and he's been waiting for a long time. We've had a streak of good luck, right? With a few jobs that work out well…. What do you think? I think we can help you. And you already know, it's a big deal to be a bullfighter. I think it's worth it. I still don't think it'll work. But you can count on me for what will work. Man, they're asking for a bunch of money so he can have his first big bullfight, got it? But we agreed that we were going to stop doing this for a while. It'll just be a few times, easy jobs that Ramon will lead. But we agreed that we were going to stop doing this for a while. It'll just be a few times, easy jobs that Ramon will lead. Good, good. Thanks, Manolo I don't know. I'm getting fed up. I'm not in. I don't work for anybody. I work for me. If you work for yourself cool man then we're done with you, got it? Hey, simmer down. And you, why don't you want to do it? Because we don't work like that, got it? That guy's out bullfighting while we're doing jobs. You're coming too, aren't you Juan? Of course. What would I be without you guys. Get out of here. I told you to leave! Supposing that Juan does come, which is supposing a lot, It'll all go toward his thing? Look, if you want to come, come. If you don't want to come, then don't. I don't owe you any explanation. And don't talk to me like that or I'll clobber you. Easy jobs, huh? Look, I'm getting sick of you. Whatever we need to do, got it? Okay, fine. But he's coming too. He's got to come. I'm not going to be a sucker. Juan? This is good. Come on Paco. Give it to him good. Okay, get the wallet. I've got it. Let's go. We've got a start. Where's Julian? He didn't come. What's going on? We'll have to do more. I'm not doing it, especially not now. That was really fast Now you can't do anything because they're looking for you. Have you seen the newspaper? But the season's over within a month. Look, it's a ton to do even if we nail it. If we let some time pass, you'll see, Ramon. I hear you. I get it. And I, of course, am finished. So I can't count on anybody!? No, it's not like that. Yes, it's true. How much more do we need? As much as we'd get with a few more jobs. We've already started this, let's finish it, at least! I think it's better to wait. I know something we could do every night and make a lot. Tell us, what could we do? You need a woman who can pull it off. And you. And a bike. If you want, you can borrow mine. And this guy… We'll see if he gets with it. What are we going to do here, Ramon? Here's something for you. It'll be twenty-four pesetas. We go all the time, and they'll catch us. No, don't talk like that. We've got to go all in. What we can't do is say we'll do it, and then this thing comes up, or we get scared, or whatever else. I told you that I'd do what I could. But he has to do his part too. And say what you want, he's the one who cracked. Okay, that's it. Let's forget it. It's over. What's going on, Ramon? I'm pissed off at these guys. Especially that prick. It seems like everything goes wrong with him. And that guy. We ask him to do something and he's all bugged. It's really just because he's scared. They're all scared, just scared. You're a bunch of cowards. He's your brother and you leave him hanging. You should be ashamed. No, what happened is the bullfighter cracked. We wanted to do it and he cracked. It's great to blame everybody else. You could have done it and it would have been fine. What happened is that he didn't know that place. He didn't crack. You're just scared like the rest of these guys. And you wouldn't even help him. Hey bullfighter. Hey, brother, what's up? It's a nice night, isn't it Juan? What a bad habit you've picked up. I guess it's not so bad. DId they say anything? No, nothing. Don't worry. What happened to you last night? You cracked under pressure, huh? You stay out of this! I'm going to kill him! I'll kill him! Hey, come on. Break it up. Come on, that's enough! That's enough! Let's go, Juan. You prick, you're an ass! How much? For you… I could do it for you for 20,000. Come up with it and I'll arrange everything. And that includes everything. We don't have that much. So why did you come? That includes everything , right? The matador's assistants, the bull, the bullfighting ring expenses, taxes, insurance… I'll take care of it all. There are a lot of expenses, guys. And the advertising? I'll take care of it all. Okay. So, we'll just be in charge of renting the suit. And when could we do it? We could do it… we could do it within three weeks. Yes, the 15th God willing. That's if you bring me the money within a few days. If not, I'll have to move on. I can't let you hold up everybody else. And now, boys, I have to work. Good luck. Okay, let's go. Would it be possible to see the bullfighting ring? Yes, here. Tell them I sent you. Thank you. How much do we have? Including the last we got, about 10,000 pesetas. Man, life is expensive. I can't believe the cost. If we're lucky, we'll get it in a half a week. Yeah, sure. We've got to get the money any way we can. Chapa, shut up already. Do you have a plan? It's a lot of money. We'll have to do the garage thing that we prepared a while ago. I've been thinking about it again. American-style. Are you ready for it? We have to have everything planned out step-by-step. Here's my plan. You all know the place where we'll do it. Hurry up. You, stay quiet or I'll bust you up. Close it. Close it. Close it Close it! Close it already. Shut up! Hit him, Juan. I'll get you. Give it to him, Juan. Calm down, Julian! Leave me alone! Let me go! I'll kill him, let me go!! Hit him good. 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000. 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 Fourteen thousand three hundred and twenty We've got to find somebody good for the posters. Yeah. What are we going to call this guy? You're walking all over us, man. We're done, now we can rest. The name is really important. And the advertising says a lot. Yeah. We need to come up with a name with a good ring to it. Give me some bullfighters' names. Of professionals? You're going to be a professional, aren't you? Well…. National, The Kid, Elitri, Luis Miguel… Okay, enough already. The Apparition. The Rooster. The Toledan. The Toledan is from Toledo, right? Well, we could call you Juan from Martos. Juan from Martos. From Martos… El Marteño. That's it, El Marteño. All right, man! Hey, have you decided? This one. Good. A little more. We'd need a shoehorn. I don't know how you're going to move in this. I'll get used to it. You look great! Where are you going now? They're waiting for me. Okay. See you later honey. It's harder than soccer, isn't it? They earn more money too. Don't be so sure, it depends. You earn a lot, don't you. Well, for now. How are you? Hey, bullfighter. You must be happy. Yeah, of course. So? What? Walk with with me. Yeah, I was going to say that. Well, I was going to ask you to walk with me. The best one this year. The best young bullfight this year. The best bullfight of the season,, Sir. Sir, the best of the century. The best of the year. Come on, sir, it's for the bullfight. Leave me alone. Hey, kid, can I have one? It's the program for the bullfight this Sunday. It's the best young bullfight of the year. Hey, do I know you? Get him! He's a thief! You're scared, aren't you? Yeah, I think about it a lot. But I can do anything now. You've got it under control, Juan. Go with your little brother. You've got it under control, Juan. Go with your little brother. You can't complain about the advertising, eh? We haven't seen Paco in a while. Don't worry. Nothing happened to him, he's fine. That guy knows the sewers better than the rats. Yeah, but he should be here by now. He's got to be out by now. After this long he wouldn't make it out alive. If Juan's great in the bullfight we'll have to organize a real advertising campaign. Will you come back to Martos when you're a famous bullfighter? They'd probably build you a bullfighting ring. Well, first they'd name a street after you. We've got to talk about how we're going to organize ourselves. What do you mean by that? Well, I think everybody should have a position in your entourage. I'll be his agent. And what else? You want a piece of everything? What about the rest of us? Do you give a damn? There'll be room for everybody. I'll drive Juan's truck. And what if I fail? Don't mess around Juan, that can't happen. Let's cool things down a bit Ramon. We're worried about Paco. He's fine down in the sewers. He knows them like the back his hand. Well, I'm not calm Is Paco here? No, he didn't come home all night. Did you find him? No. I don't understand it. What could have happened to him? Don't worry, man. His family's clueless. He hasn't been there all day. I don't like this. Can I have a smoke? You could buy some. We need to keep looking for Paco. It'd be best to split up. Let me rest a bit. Okay, let's get a glass of wine and then figure things out. Who'd you talk to? His brother. And what did he say? This is the first time this has happened. I wonder if they caught him. Have you seen Paco? No, I haven't seen him for a few days. No, I haven't seen him. Do you know who I'm talking about? Yeah, of course. Antonio! Antonio! Paco! He doesn't have anything to identify him. Hey, do you know who that is? (Unintelligible) What do you want, kid? Get out of here. Paco. Goodbye. Paco. Poor guy. Good Juan. Be brave. Bull… Ole! All right, Juan! Yeah, man. All right man! I'm looking for Juan. Why? Him. That was a great jab with the darts. What do you think? Should we arrest him now or after the bullfight? What's going on? Aren't we the ones he's supposed to salute? Don't be dumb. First it goes to the presidency, then to us. Here he comes, guys. I dedicate this bull to you guys Let's go, Juan. Learn to bullfight, kid! Let's go. I can't watch this. Come on, pick it up! Get it done with! Kill it already! Come on, kid. Finish it off! Be brave, Juan. Courage.
