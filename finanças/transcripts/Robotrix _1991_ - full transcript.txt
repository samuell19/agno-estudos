Come here, beautiful. Come on... Such a loss to gain from this mission. So much to see here Wouldn't it be great if we got to bathe together? What are you men doing? Selina, Selina Please behave more respectfully and address myself as Inspector Lam. Your highness. It's all the same. Why not come join us in the bath? I represent the Hong Kong Police and my duty is to protect your royal highness. I cannot allow myself to do anything else. Unfortunate. Unfortunate indeed. I'd better step outside and wait. If anything, come out and look for me. Yes, Madam. Let's move! Come on. Stand still. Madam. It's not easy being a cop. I'd even have to escort him while he bathes. You're so naughty. You're the naughty one. Twist it. Come, you're the first one to accompany me tonight. You're the first! You ran out of luck. Then what is my ranking, prince? Then, wait in line! There's four of us here, Can you resist us? Selina, Selina. Joe Who's the bastard that did this to her? Let me go in and see how badly hurt she is. -Selina, Selina. -Joe, -don't be like this. - I want to go in and see her. -Joe Sir. -Let go of me! Calm down! -Let go! -Calm yourself. Madam Lam's in critical condition from her gunshot wound. She's having an operation. Your interruptions will only disturb the doctors operating on her. Joe, These are Selena's belongings. I'll hand them over to you. This Arabian oil tycoon is the biggest buyer in this year's convention. He has a high interest in robotics. He plans to develop a legion of robots. It's no wonder why so many countries have sent robots at the convention. They all want to cooperate with him. If we gain the support of this oil tycoon. We will never have to worry about our funding for robotics research anymore. But there are still so many countries... Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the exhibition into the future world. The show of the latest android models from around the world is about to begin. If you direct your attention to the center stage, you will see the first offering Which in this case, is a unit from Germany Ah! It's German. These units feature the latest in titanium metal alloys. They are controlled by the latest in chip technology UZ185372. Their life-like skin is the latest in flexible latex components. If you look up, you'll see that models of both sexs present no problems. And of course, movement co-ordination has been perfectly tuned. Their eyes incorporate the most advanced laser-sensored discoveries. And of course, they are the ultimate fighting machines powered by an electrical current of 100 million watts! Damn it! I don't think you're so tough. With my sheer size, I can definitely defeat you. Our country welcomes all challenges. Please come and try it out yourself. Please. Damn it! Come on! Damn it! Thank you. Your German robot is really out of date. Not only is it overweight, it's clumsy. Our American robot is as powerful as yours. But it's far more superior. It's smaller, it's better equipped, it's faster. Hey! What are you doing? Stop! Excuse me, please! This robot is a product of our country. Its serial number is Eve-R27. In regards to her movement and functions, I'm sure everybody have seen and noticed. I have no need to elaborate here. I am very satisfied with the performance of your Eve-27. I now officially invite you to participate in our Robot Legion developmental plans. Thank you, your majesty. Our country feels very much honoured. Step aside! Thank you. Your majesty, as your son was swimming this morning, he had been kidnapped by an unidentified man. What? Kidnapped? How are you, your majesty? I recognize this man. His name is Ryuichi Yamamoto. He's a Japanese scientist specialized in robotics. He has made contact with me many times. He hoped to work with me on the development of the robot legion project. But I turned down his offer. I know this man as well. Due to his theories going overboard. The Japanese government had issued a restraint order against him. He is not to ever make any further research on robots. His whereabouts were unknown afterwards. You've repeatedly turned my request to work with you. But did you know that by doing so, you've not only has that insulted me, you have also insulted the robots that I've created? I want you to know this. It was a grave mistake for you to turn down my offer for our collaboration. No matter how brilliantly built a robot is, its intelligence can never be compared to a human. That is why they are easily conquered over by mankind. However, if human thoughts and robotic programming can be combined. It can control itself. It will never be controlled by humankind. Human thoughts combined with robots? That is directly feeding human thoughts into the computer programming of a robot. That robot would simultaneously give the robot the advantages of human beings and That's right. But that could have serious repercussions We can control a robot. However, we cannot control a robot with human thoughts. It's due to the fact that we simply cannot control the mind of a human being. What exactly does he want? He wants to transfer his mind into the robot next to him What is he doing? Only the dead may go through the mind transfer. You've seen this video. Did he succeed? If he didn't succeed, would he be able to kidnap the prince? What? So he's the one who kidnapped my son? Your majesty, you've just witnessed everything that has happened. Now, you shouldn't be refusing my offer for our cooperation, right? I will look for you no matter what. I shall make you cooperate with me. Other than this video, there is also a letter. Take a look! Your majesty, by the time you have received this letter, your son, the prince, is already in my hands. In regards to the formation of the robot legion, I will keep in touch with you later. Ryuichi Yamamoto. You've got to help me get my son back. Normal people will be unable to handle him. We have Eva. I'm sure with the help of the Hong Kong police, we will be able to get him. I have full confidence in Eva and the Hong Kong police force. But with the way she looks, she might scare people away. We can't do this. Don't worry. We can remodel Eva to look more human. Take a look. Is there any difference from a real human? That's right. But can her face be remodeled? Then, what do you think of my assistant, Ann? Her? She's gorgeous. Ann is actually a robot. Really? You're...? Impossible! Impossible! You don't look like one. It's true. Image is absolutely not a problem. Right. Our best solution right now, is to transfer the mind of the female police officer who was murdered by Yamamoto on to Eva. Then our chances in following Yamamoto will get a little closer. We will even be able to fight him effectively. Wait! What is the place? I'm Dr. Sara. This is my assistant, Ann. Thank you both for saving me. Theoretically speaking, you can put it that way. Didn't you two just operated on me? We did do an operation on you. But we didn't save you. You were too seriously wounded to be saved. I was too seriously wounded to be saved? Then, does that mean that I'm dead? That's impossible. Then, why am I still sitting here? That's because you are now already a robot. A female robot. A female robot? You must be insane! I want to get out of the hospital! I want out! Calm down and listen to me. I know this will be hard for you to accept. But you are really dead. I'm the one who has transferred your mind into a robot. Then, I remodelled it to look exactly like you. If you are still not convinced, you should take a look for your chest. Why? Why was I chosen? Because you're smart and capable. You are knowledgeable in criminology and you've got a great sense of justice. The main reason is because you have just died. Since I'm dead, you should have let me stay dead. Why? Why did you turn me into this thing and not let me rest in peace? You shouldn't be saying that. Because only by feeding human thoughts into Eve's computer can allow us a fighting chance to defeat Ryuichi Yamamoto. And you've just... You should be proud. You may be physically dead. However, your spirit lives on to serve and protect the community. Besides, you're now assigned to wipe out the murderer who killed you. A mad robot who undermines social security. Without you, we can't possibly be able to defeat him. That's right. Forget everything you've done in the past. And together, we will reach our common goal. Wipe out Ryuichi Yamamoto. Flowers for you, madam. Thank you. The flowers are beautiful. What are you doing? Having a party? It's so late already. What's going on? You came early! Didn't they say you got a severe gun wound? No. It's just a small scratch. I recovered after taking some medication. Why were you receiving first aid in the operating room yesterday? I rammed my head when I fell. They were worried that I might get a shock. I bought these fruits. Madam's doing fine. Are you really alright? Where were you wounded? I don't seem to see any signs. I really don't get it. Now, you understand better. Thanks! This customer sure is generous. -Then, you must be getting lucky. -Of course! You've been sitting here all alone for a long time. Why don't I keep you company while you treat me for drink? You asshole! Trying to make advances on my girlfriend? Flirting with my girlfriend means you have completely underestimated me. Biggy, cut some slack here! We're doing business right now. Fine! I'll cut you some slack. Take him to the washroom. Go! The girl you spoke to, belongs to me. But I can allow if it is what you want. I'll give her to you for ten grand. Ten grand? I don't have ten grand. I do have a hundred. You're pretty cocky, asshole. Wanna bet that I'll beat you up? Settled so soon? Yes! Settled for $100. That cheap? Settled with $1007? You've got to be kidding me! Impossible. Let's see how the boss is doing. Boss! Are you human? Such a long time and you haven't yet finished? You're insane! I quit. Go! Go away! Don't come over! Get out! Go! Go! Attention! I'm sure you all know Selina. As of now, she'll be in charge of this task force. This is Dr. Sara. And this is her assistant, Ann. I've invited them both to assist us in the investigation of this serious matter. Nice! Hot stuff! Sir, with all due respect, I believe this mad murderer is extremely dangerous. With 3 fragile ladies joining our investigation, I'm just afraid they would hamper with our work. Do you guys agree? Not necessarily Any problems? No problem... Then, work hard on the case! Yes, Sir! Alright! Communicate with each other from now on. Yes, Sir! Dismissed. My name is Lun, My hobby is serving beautiful women. So, if there's anything you need, just give me a call. What would you like for breakfast? I'll buy it for you. Are you busy tonight? Never thought I'd see you transferred to our division. Yes, Well, life is full of surprises. Ms. Ann, we're facing a mad murderer here. Are you scared? Don't you worry about that. We've been trained for this. We could handle it. Really? Then, can you show a little demo performance for us? Sure! Here! Come with me. How do we play? You guys come and hold me down. Come here. I'm coming! You bastards playing tricks on me? You asked for it. Still laughing? Let's have a toast to celebrate our working in the same team together. Cheers! I've waited this chance for a long time. Did you know that? Lately, I've been studying every night and making preparations for promotion exams. All this hard work and for what? To promote to your rank and work closely with you. But now that we're together. You're not going to give up on the exams, are you? It depends. Do you know why I would have acrophobia? Were you born in an airplane? Al the time when I was still a police cadet, I saw a teen around 13 - 14 years old one day. He mugged a gold ring from an old lady. I estimate it weighs around 0.3 - 4 taels. I chased him down and got to the roof a building. I went after him. He was scared and carelessly fell down the streets. I came to pull him back up but it was far too late. He continued falling down. He kept staring at me with his eyes filled with fear and hatred. And it never stopped until he got to the ground. Ever since that time, whenever I look down from a tail building. I feel the presence of his eyes staring at me. So I become afraid, very afraid. Let's not talk about the bad stuff. Let's listen to some music instead. Come on! Sir, what song would you like to hear? Happy Birthday, of course. Today's your birthday? Of course not. It's your birthday. Mine? Oh right! I forgot about . What's that you're looking at? This cake is beautiful. Thank you. Blow out the candles. Blow it! Happy Birthday! Is it true? Have you really made love to him? Don't ask. Dr. Sara, just exactly how human love-making is like? Can you tell me? You won't understand unless you have a human mind. If I had the chance, I must try having sexual intercourse with a human being. Tell me, guys. We've been searching day and night yet haven't received any clues. And these prostitutes die day by day, one after another. If this goes on, all the hookers would be extinct. Our police anti-prostitution division would have to be disbanded. I'm just afraid that before the anti-prostitution squad is disbanded, our entire team would face a demotion in rank. Well, it looks like we've got no chance but to use the old and effective method again. What? You want us to pose as hookers again? We won't need you this time. The three of us is good enough for the job. 3 of what? Madam. He said you three will pose yourselves as whores. It'll be bait to lure the murderer. Okay. We don't need three of them. Just one of them is fine enough. Let me do it. Yes, such an easy task. Just leave it to Ann. Since I wanted to understand the life of a prostitute. Put it here. How is it? -Madam, your figure is fine. -Very pretty! Come and take a look. -Get back to work! -That's very sexy. See if that other side can see it and if the position is right. How is it? See anything? Positioning okay? I see an image. Head left. Too much, go back a little. Okay. It's done. Okay. Is it done? I have to go back for a meeting with the Commissioner. I'll let you guys take it from here. Don't worry. Each and every one of us are skilled male labor. Am I right, you guys? Just be careful, Ann. Alright. Bye! Bye Bye! Smarten up. That mad murderer's very skilled at cosmetic make-up. Don't let him deceive you. Alright. Another thing, the commissioner will be around for inspection later. Don't you worry about that. You should head-back first. I'll call you if anything. Bye... The Queen of Queens? This is Chickadee calling Chicken Coop. Something's up. Copy? Roger. Over and out. Who would you to patronize, boss? The Queen of Queens, of course! That'll be $300. Thank you. Welcome! Nice. Are you new at this? Yes. This is my first time. First time? Yes, I would like to try human love-making. Terrific! Terrific... Why is it all silent up there? Chickadee calling Chicken Coop, what's the situation up there? Ann is very focused and she has already stripped away her clothing. What are you doing? My nose is bleeding from all that excitement. Why grunt? Bye-bye! Leaving, Boss? Not leaving! I'll give it another go! The man's going for another session. You again? Of course, you're so beautiful. I wanted to give it another shot. It's time I go off-duty. You guys better take it from here. You'd leave at a climax like that? Let him go! He probably couldn't take it and chose to jerk off. Chickadee calling Chicken Coop. Something's up. Do you copy? Coming. You better come out now. How can I help you, boss? The Queen of Queens, of course! That'll be $300. Thank you. This way please. 206... Look. It's this guy. Joe, I can't see a thing now. What do we do? Listen to the audio. You can't come in now. So our only compromise is the audio. Come on! Hurry up. Take that handkerchief away. Quick! Puppy, why are you taking off your panties? What? Puppy? Is there a puppy in sight? Puppy? Are there any puppies in sight? None, where could it be? You're still denything? So it's you! -You've got the wrong man. -Incorrigible! The nerve of you, pretending to be a whoremonger. You still deny? You of all people and as a police officer would even pretend to be a whoremonger. I'm just a regular citizen when I'm off duty. I should have the rights of a regular citizen too. What rights? Patronizing whores. Patronizing whores? Commissioner, they're now upstairs. I'll bring you upstairs to show you. This way please. My friend tells me that she's great. Is this for real? It's true. You'll know it when you try her out. Her body is fine! What are you doing? Step in line. What's with the line-up? They're lining up to patronize a prostitute. Lining up for prostitute? Of course! Step in line! I'm police officer? So what if you're a cop? Cops don't need to line up? Move it! Get out of my way! Move it! Out of the way. Don't block the path. Stop butting in. Be quiet! Sir. What are you people doing? Never thought Ann's doing great business here. Cancel this operation immediately. It must be you guys who are messing around. -It's none of my business. -Get back and write me -a detailed report on this right away. -It's none of my business! I'm not involved. It's him! Clean everything up. It's cancelled. Do you hear me? It's my turn. There's no call girl here. Scram! At least, let me give it a shot. I've waited a long time for this. Snitchy Fai. Have you seen this person before? No. You say no when you aren't even sure? Sir, I'm known for having photographic memory. If you've found him for me. You can forget all the debts that you owe us. Is that so? You better keep your word on that. Since when have I lied to you? If that's the case, I'll find your man even if I have to risk my life. Three beautiful girls... It's a loss. It's such a big boss. Look at the bright side. We're doing our jobs. I just fear that we'd attract a big group of perverts instead of the killer. It's been so long and we haven't cracked the case yet. But we've got to keep trying. Just make sure we don't get into the same mess we caused last time. Chug it up. Fastest chugger wins. So what if we win? If you win, you'll get whatever you want. But if I win, you'll have to do as I say. She's a lady. Since you said it, you can have it your way. Great! I'm well known for my sharpshooting skills. You won't make it. No problem. Ready! 1,2, 3. Amazing. I won! How about it? I admit defeat. Have your say, we'll have it your way. I want you to get out of here at once. Get out of here. She's so beautiful yet she has kidney problems. How unfortunate. Who are you? Ryuichi Yamamoto? Stand still. Don't run. Don't run. Yamamoto. Chung! Freeze! Police! What's wrong with you? That bump really hurts. -What? -Out of the car! Over there. Have you seen this person? Look closely. No. What's the matter? Don't ask. Just tell me when you see him around. You've got nothing to lose. -You got that? -Alright. Help me out here. Anyway, as long as the oil tycoon hasn't promised our cooperation, I won't provide you people with any money. But I've already helped you kidnap the prince. I won't lie to you. Since you asked for it, I'll give you 50%. Very well. It's a deal. I'll make contact with you to tell you where to pick up your money. What's wrong, dude? Why are you following me? How can I be following you when I don't even know you? Why? Why did you kill him? No one can know our secret. Hold on. I have an idea. It could lead us to some clues. Coroner, will you please do me the favor of removing his eyes for me? Once a person dies in a emotional extremity or fear, his final visions before death will stay in the cells of his visionary membrane. Before these cells are completely dead, We should re-arrange these images through a computer. We will then be able to get a glimpse of what the deceased withnessed before his death. We've got an image. So it's Ryuichi Yamamoto who killed him. I recongnize those three. They're the bodyguards of the oil tycoon. I've seen them at the convention. What convention? It's strange. Why would they be with Yamamoto? We'll be able to track down Yamamoto if we followed his bodyguards. Where's the money? Did you bring it? What? How did they get down there? You're still asking? Hurry up and get down there to help. Go! Hurry up! Get up. -Do not enter. -What has happened in there? -You can't come in. -Why won't you let me in? Listen. You shouldn't be coming in, Joe. Who is Yamamoto exactly? There wasn't any physical effect on him when I opened fire on him. Bombing him didn't Ann's injured and yet, she hasn't been sent to the hospital. Dr. Sara is doing an operation on her. Operation on her? Dr. Sara's a medical doctor? Is this a hospital? -She's not a medical doctor. -You haven't given me the answers yet. Just what exactly is Yamamoto? Please don't ask. When on earth are you people up to? -We're... -Don't lie to me. Joe. -Open the door! Open the door! -Stop it. Listen to me. Ryuichi Yamamoto is a robot. A robot? Then, I'm the Masked Rider. Not only is Yamamoto an robot, but Ann is a robot too. Dr Sara is now undergoing repairs for her. I think you're the one who needs repairing. You're getting more farfetched as you explain, lady. I know it's going to be hard to convince you. Come. Is that convincing for you now? I don't mind telling you now. When I was shot that time, I had actually died. Dr. Sara transferred my mind to a robot. Ann and I are both robots. That's impossible! Impossible! Let me out! Let me out! I beg you to let me go. Let me go. I beg you. Don't! Don't! Don't! I'm glad that the love between you and Selina are genuine. My physical structure may be different from human beings. However, there is no difference in appearance, body and mind compared to the old Selina. What Selina can do in the past, I can do the same. Morning Joe said he'll be back in the police station later. If see him, tell him that he might be with Selina. Might be? I'd say he is with her. What's going on? Yamamoto. Sit. -Step out of the car. Go! -Leave! Move it! Puppy. Puppy. A policeman was killed outside the police station at 9:45 a.m. this morning. Two Japanese scientists have also received injury from the same incident. -According to our live coverage? -It's the commissioner. Sir. -Hurry up! -Move it! Commissioner, will you please comment on the issue? Rumours are abound that the culprit is no ordinary man. -Or motives? -Any clues? Everybody! Everybody! Everybody! Please listen to me. I will make a further update for everyone at a more appropriate time. Please step out of the way. Is this the work of a terrorist? Commissioner! Commissioner! Why are you here, your majesty? Regarding the cooperation with Professor Yamamoto, I've already decided to cooperate with him. Your majesty. But why, your majesty? Why? This is why. I don't want my son to be drilled to death by Yamamoto. Professor Yamamoto has killed enough innocent people. If you work with him on the robot legion, the world will be in mass devastation. How can I bear to watch my son die by the hands of a monster? Tell me what I should do. Don't worry. We'll take care of Yamamoto as soon as possible. Can you people deal with that monster? You'll only be dying one by one Until you're all dead. What are you saying? What are you saying? -Joe! -Joe! Give us a few more days. We'll take your son back to safety as quickly as we can. Very well. Three days, I'll give you three more days. If you can't save my son, then, don't blame me. I'll have no choice but be forced to work with Yamamoto. Listen to me. I am his target. I faked an injury to live in a hospital. I became a bait in order to lure him over here. -Come out! -Commissioner! Commissioner! What does the police have to say regarding on this tragedy? What action will the police take? How badly injured is the scientist from Japan? This case is an extremely insane behavior. We've gathered the culprit's information. I believe we will solve the case very soon. As for the female scientist from Japan, she hasn't been heavily injured. She in now under observation in the hospital right now. In regards to her female assistant, she is in good condition. Any comments on this incident during your inspection in Hong Kong? This cold-blooded behaviour is inhumane. From what I see, this culprit's animalistic killings is only letting him release his beast-like behavior. I believe he's not human. He's a monster. Because his behavior proves that he's worse than a dog. Beasts him deserve capital punishment. He should be mutilated. Do you have any plans to apprehend him? Hurry up! Over there! Stop him over there. Don't move! -Stand still. -Don't move! Hold it right there. Don't move! After him! Don't move! You have been surrounded by the police. Drop your weapons and surrender now. Commissioner, he won't comply with your demands. He'll unleash his insane behavior at any time. Open fire! Take hime away immediately! I must remove his computer program and memory banks. It's alright. Where did you hide the oil tycoon's son? Would you believe I'd blow your head off with my gun, you asshole? I'll tell you! I'll tell you! Where is the prince? Say it! Inside a cave at the Kowloon Peak. Hold on. I still want to do some research on him. Go! Saving the prince is crucial now. Call headquarters. We've got the prince's whereabouts. You've underestimated me. I don't die that easily. I won't let you die that easily either. That asshole! Still lying after death. Selina. Don't die, Selina. Get up, Selina! Joe, Selina's been dead for a long time now. Rescue the prince first. Prince? We don't even know where he is. If the lab gets damaged, the data of every person going out will be fed into our computer. We'll definitely find him. Follow me! We've found his trace. Hurry up! How's Dr. Sara? Don't mind me! Save the prince first! Hurry up and go! Go! Don't! Don't! Who are you? Don't worry, your highness. I'm cop. Here, I'll carry you out. Here. Be careful. How is it now? Go up and untie him! It's so high. I can't make it. Why don't you go? I can't go up. Why? Our computer system shield wouldn't be affected at a typical magnetic field. But at a magnetic field so high up there, it would definitely disrupt our entire computer system. Just like Yamamoto. His computer system has now suffered heavy interference. He is now in a uncontrollable state. Only you alone can go up there. It's too high. I really can't do it. I can't do it. Don't! Hurry up. -I'm scared of heights. -Hurry up! It's getting late. I can't do it. Go! I can't do it. Go up! Hurry up! We'll meet again when the chance comes. I hope nothing like this will happen when we meet next time. You never can tell. Take care. Likewise. Focus on your work after your vacation. Yes, Sir! Hop in. Get in. Joe. What are you up to, Joe? You said you'll pick me from my home and go on excursion to protect the prince. I've been waiting at home until now and you had the nerve to come back alone? Answer me! Why are you muttering like that? Everybody's left. You better give me a good explanation. Professor, how did you get Selina's old memories? The computer had a back-up of her memories when we did the mind transfer. Isn't it better now? We can treat it like nothing happened. What will happen if she finds out that she's a robot? Then Joe will have to slowly give her an explanation. You better explain to me! Why are you so late? No excuse.
