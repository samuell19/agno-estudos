Dad mom ! Do not torture her. No, it's interesting. I did not think about it. The fish will be ready. Have a comment for Boris? "I hardly know him." - I'm going to talk to you about it ! Boris, that's our problem. He's a very good boy. All there was in Odessa, It was given to him. He graduated from high school. Entering medical school, it's something ! "What does Kaufmann say about him?" "He has hands in gold." Lioussik, we already know in Kiev! But it's not important. My son can make Happy one who will be with him. When he meets her, He will offer her a ring. Boris, show the ring to Lioudmila! Do not expect much. No value. It is not even in gold. The day Lioussik offered it to me, He was higher than Deribas. Another treasure of the family. Sonia cooks admirably. I'll tell you a joke! A grandfather is on the verge To die in a Jewish family. He said to a little boy: "Grandma prepares fish. "I smell the smell. Let her bring me a piece. " Little Fima returns:"Grandmother said That it was for later. " You understood ? Do you understand that? You laugh ? Turn on the radio. It started. What? Say it! Without declaration of war To the Soviet Union The German troops attacked our country. Our borders. What did I say ! They bombed Jitomir, Kiev ... It is the end. Sevastopol, Kaunas and others ... This is not the end. Hitler has his plans, we ourselves. Boris, we insist that you invite Liouda at the theater. La Traviata is given today. Shooting has also been opened since The Romanian and Finnish territories. What did your father say? Come on, or we'll be late. Liouda, you must not. War is not for women. It is not for the cowards! Young people, silence! Liouda! War is death. I am a doctor, I can make you A special assignment. You do not have to participate ... You're right, Boris, But my father said I should. I can not stay stuck. I am ashamed. And you, can you? We need me here. Everyone has to do what they can. I was trained in precise shooting. We need me there. You, Boris, go to the opera. Liouda! Liouda! Even light is foreign. There it is war. Here they are interested in my lingerie And the color of my red. Can you explain that to me? The President's wife ... - Nikolai! "What have you talked about?" Can you explain? Ms. Eleanor Roosevelt invited Miss Pavlitchenko To live in the White House During his visit to America. Only Miss Pavlichenko! We have a regulation for that? Until now, no Soviet At the White House without delegation. I do not have to go. It is a chance. Important problems Are settled at the president's office. It's better to have someone. Yes. You know what, Miss Pavlichenko? Decide for yourself. It's going to be hot. You do not want Renew her wardrobe? I want her in uniform. The press too. - You did everything? - Of course. I wanted to understand Liouda as a woman. How can one kill in cold blood 309 men? Why did she take a gun? It's not for a woman. Our journalists called Lioudmila Lady Death. I noticed that it hurt her. She was intelligent and well-bred. She was beautiful. But the war came to his house. She had no choice. What's more, she had the talent To become invisible and to aim justly. Training camp, summer 1941 The shooter must take a Without being noticed. To do this, one must know how to prone. Drop the back! Left leg, gun, right leg! Slide and not drag yourself! Hand near the grenadi?re. Killed! Your back is over! An excellent target for the enemy! The leg, the arm! Did not you hear? Warrant Officer! How will you fight with that? What do you have to laugh at? I see that you do not realize that The Germans took Jitomir and Riga And that they are approaching Kiev and Leningrad. It was believed that war would be easy And quick victory. But we are backward! You understand ? We back off! And we suffer enormous losses! Tomorrow these losses will be you. And you ! Burn all business Not regulatory! Not lying down! Hold on tight ! Stand up ! Faster ! Dig deeper! Lower your back! From the outfit, soldiers! Turn around! Notify me of changes! - A stone has disappeared. - The cross too. The haystack is moved 5 m to the left. - The clod has taken the place of the stump. - That's all ? The stone is moved to the right Of one meter. Not bad. Turn around! At your positions, fast! Camouflage outfits. False. Let us go further. That's the right position. Kill ! Interesting, but not very effective. Kill ! The flowers are not from here. Comrade Commandant, you are killed. We'll start shooting when? Pavlitchenko! You still want to shoot? - Affirmative! - Safe ? Certain. In combat ! "Comrade Commandant, go away!" - Drawn ! You're a sniper, not an artilleryman! New ! Not bad to start with! The first five, To your shooting positions! Exhaust two batches of ammunition. Hello ! Take the guys, but not the girls! They still have to train! We have just received munitions. They have only been trained Of six months. - I pity them. - I pity mine too. Less than half are left. Listen, there's a girl ... Take care, it will be better than you. Pavlichenko. Odessa, September 1941 Do not let them approach. As soon as you see an officer, shoot. A killed commander equals a half-detachment kill. Save on ammunition. Tanks, comrade captain. There are two ways to stop a tank. One, throw grenades very close. And two ? Pull an anti-armor ammunition In the vision slit. Reach the same location twice For the glass to burst. Kill the pilot with a 3rd ammo. It's clear. Then give me ammunition anti-shielding. Air Attack! Are you hurt? Or ? Some blood. Here, alcohol. Stay here.

I swear not to spare myself In the fight against the enemy And to kill a hundred Nazis with this rifle. Rest, political instructor. Makarov! Watch out for her. If it looks like To his father ... Did you understand? Yes I understood. A new weapon needs to be adjusted. There are not two similar rifles. It is necessary to understand the of each one. And take care of it as a woman. You have a wife, Comrade Captain? No, I have no one. I had one. I was afraid of getting married. I had just returned Of the Winter War in Finland. I could not believe That a woman as young and beautiful Can love me. At the beginning of the war, I did not know protect her. I did not have the time. - Liouda! - Macha! - Liouda! - Macha! Macha! - At last I found you! - Where do you come from ? - Watch out, Macha! - Liouda! I have to tell you. We will fight together. You, me and Grisha. - Who is Gricha? - You do not remember? My pilot, Gricha! He is mine ! And this one, is it yours? It will be. Miss, is Russia capable of To defeat Nazism without our help? The USSR is currently The burden of war. But the Nazi aggression Is a global misfortune. And you, you are not an aggressor? Finland, the Polish lands? You have thousands of prisons. You fight your own people.

Two Nazis from the outset and the 3rd, She waited for him. We even bet. He lit a cigarette, thinking That he was not seen. She, she fired. You see, smoking kills. Take it. Come in the evening to the scouts. You will be given warmth. - We're warm here. "But we are waiting for you." Then, Liouda, You will probably Receive a medal. Comrade Captain, You shot at night? It happened to me. Once I went hunting To the Winter War. Here I find a position interesting. If I aim from here, I can kill three With one shot. I hide and I wait. Pan! It is done ! But I was counted only one. They did not believe me Since I only shot once. Three? - Filipchuk! - Yes ! - Where is Pavlitchenko? - To the right. She changed position. Come on! Pavlitchenko! Come here ! Who allowed you to leave your position? If we were talking in the trench? Come on, good man! Come on! That's all. Come on, get up! - What are you doing, you idiot? - What?

You are not a woman, but a soldier Soviet. Do not forget it. You go to the microphone:Stalin, A common enemy, the second front. Without surprises, understood? At your service. What have they done to you? I can not anymore. The men had to defend you. Sevastopol, summer 1942 Liouda! Liouda, I ... Help ! Help ! Help ! Leonid! Help ! It does not matter ! It's okay, Lionia. Lionia. Where is Lionia? He succumbed to his wounds. Calm down. You hear me ? I feel guilty. For you the war is over. You are reformed. Unsuitable for service. Who is reformed? Pavlichenko is not a simple soldier, It is a symbol impossible to reform. Leave the hospital! You want to go through the court? Come on! This is not a resort For ex-girlfriends. Did not you read? The Germans announced his death. An attack will be launched. My soldiers will fight Pronouncing his name. I will lodge a complaint with General Petrov. It is her order to put her back on her feet. We need her on the front. Let me do it. She does not look heroic. Smiling. Raise your head. A little more cheerfulness. - Comrade Commissioner. - Pavlitchenko! Enter. Here, look. One of the best German shooters, Otto Von Singer, wants your skin. They believed us. It worked with the picture. Intelligence has identified it in this sector. I can not, Comrade Commissioner. You know it's important To win this duel. He is the best, I am not more. Here is the certificate Of Dr. Tchopak. I am unsuitable for service. How many of your comrades will he kill? - I will not be able to. - You have to. Not for me. - I will not be able to. - Not for you. For Lionia Kitsenko! Okay. Okay. I must see the general, please. - Comrade General of Brigade. - What do you want ? It is important to evacuate Sergeant Pavlichenko. And the others not?

She is finally a woman! And she did not deserve that? Evacuation coupon Tchopak B. Let me pass. I'm a military doctor! I have an evacuation coupon. - Liouda, wait for me! - Do not push! Backward ! Stand back, I said! Stop the panic! Boris, wait. It feels good the sea, huh? As in Odessa. When you got to the beach to tell me That you must See me in swimsuit. Sonia, the fish, La Traviata, Your parents, your family ring, - the archives, Mendel. - Do you remember the ring? I always knew that one day I will offer it to you. You know, we would have had five children. Five ! Boris! Sonia would have taught you to cook. I know how to make dumplings. We would all gather around a table. - Everyday. - Yes. Exception for evenings at the Opera. Boris, I do not like opera. I prefer cinema. - Quick ! We're embarking! - Warning. Liouda, hold the bag, everything is there. Boris, what about you? I'll take the next ship. I am A Jew from Odessa, I'll get by. Prepare for an emergency immersion. Hold on ! Boris! Let me go. Wait! No, I do not want ! Lioudmila made me discover one Of the most atrocious pages of war. The defense of Sebastopol lasted 250 days. But the city was captured by the enemy. Neither military nor civilian evacuated. General Petrov. Only two submarines left Sevastopol. The 1st with the archives of the party, Confidential documents And valuables. The 2nd with 80 officers. Admiral Oktiabrski was evacuated by plane. Lioudmila miraculously escaped. Thanks to the man who did not have time To ask her in marriage. He gave her his pass. The pass of life. Boris, the man who loved him, Macha, her friend, And 100,000 other defenders And the inhabitants of Sebastopol remained. One-on-one with the enemy. Condemned to death and captivity. Liouda often said That they were all heroes. Chicago, September 1942 gentlemen, I am 25. I killed 309 Nazi invaders. Do not you think That you take refuge Too long behind me? We have become friends. By her letters, I know she is not Returned to the front. That she was a shooting instructor. After the war, she His university degree. It was awarded the title Of Heroes of the USSR. Moscow, 1957 She won all her wars. As a soldier, As a diplomat and as a woman. I want to see his son. I'm sure he's like him. Yes, Mr. Khrushchev can wait.
