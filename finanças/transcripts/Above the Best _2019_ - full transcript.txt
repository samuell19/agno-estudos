Eight, nine, ten... Colossal 31, it was an NVG mission, night vision goggles, which means we're flying at night time using nothing but the, uh, binoculars that we had. - 4143, you're in the group. - South. We had a Chinook unit that was attached to us called the Washington Air National Guard, who had been going in and out of the same LZ during the day time, weeks prior. So when they heard that we were gonna be coming out of Bagram doing it under NVGs, they kinda called us up and said, "Don't do it, because it's really high on the ridgeline, very high winds, and a very steep valley". But the Ground Force Commander wanted to be exfilled under NVGs. So with that being said, we put our most experienced pilot in command on board, we put our most experienced PI, and we put four crew members in the back, not just three. You got a bad filter? Hold your fort. - Hold her down. - Roger that. Dropping back down to about 500 AGO. - Maintain it at 81. - Okay. Copy that, 06. Looks like we're about two clicks from the LZ. We've only got 364 days to go. The winds were pretty high, the landing zone was essentially a rock ledge that was probably 20 meters wide. Colossal 31, be careful on the approach, I see a lot of trees on that ridge line. What the pilots were trying to do was back in with the ramp down, put the lip of the ramp on the rock, uh, ledge, have the LRAS team, I believe was seven people, uh, come onto the Chinook and then, uh, fly away. They had to do a tailgate landing. It's something we'd practiced, it's in our ATM, this is what we do. Alright, I'm bringing her down. Keep it steady, keep it steady. So, we were tearing there. They kinda started drifting aft. It's coming awful close to that tree line, Colossal 31. We're right on the ridge. A massive, 31. Come in, come in. Back at Bagram, probably about eleven o'clock at night, our SP knocked on the doors and said that, uh, Eric Totten's aircraft went down. The aft rotor system hit a tree, causing the forward and the aft rotor system to collide and completely tore apart the entire helicopter. Nobody survived, we lost all ten. There was nothing but burning embers at the bottom of the valley. We were in disbelief that like, "This cannot be happening right now." We were all listening. We were listening for our friends to come home. And they never came home. What happened with the Apache? They left our friends. So, this is all the stuff I have from Afghanistan and, and my time of active duty in the army. This is the actual patch that we had on our flight suits, it says, "Ugly but well hung". This is 10th Mountain's, a patch they gave to us. The Apache, the Hawk and the, and the Chinook right there. So, they came in that night, we're standing in between our B Huts outside, it was already getting dark and the captain starts telling us about what happened. He starts telling us that, "I guess you heard, the Chinook crashed last night. And those guys pretty much killed themselves and everybody on board", and he came across blaming them. Sat there for... what seemed like forever, I think, "What, what the hell? That's... that's horrible." And he said, "No, that's not the worst of it." You know, you... "What do you mean that's not the worst of it?" So, he goes, "10th Mountain's blaming us, the Apaches, for leaving them. Your buddies left them." At that point he said like, "If y'all hear anything from 10th Mountain bad about us, just ignore them. They don't know what they're talking about." And at that point, my blood pressure was through the roof. I pointed at the captain and told him, "Who the fuck are you to bad-mouth American troops like that? Who the hell are you to leave American troops on that mountain. Don't you ever do that. How dare you leave our guys like that?" I read that every now and then to remind me also that you gotta watch out for everybody else in life. "He called upon us all the sum of his knowledge and made a judgement. He believed in it so strongly that he knowingly bet his life on it. That he was mistaken in his judgement is a tragedy, not stupidity. Every supervisor and contemporary who ever spoke to him, had an opportunity to influence his judgement, so a little bit of all of us goes in with every troop we lose." Now, gotta read that, every now and then. I haven't been up here since these guys started shooting and stuff. - Oh really? - Yeah. Won't be surprised if we find some RPGs in that woodpile down there. Stay to the right here, till we can get over this thing, if not we can make a left turn. Don't descend unless you have to, alright? - Roger. - Keep the altitude that we got. What we were being told to expect coming into Afghanistan was that the insurgency was ba... basically broken. Roger and over. So we'd turn on the lights, we found a lot of Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and all of a sudden, we were in contact just about everywhere. Shit. I'm taking fire. Just... Yeah, pick up your speed as fast as you can. It's really not good up here. Nobody up here. We just received fire about two clicks east of the Lumberyard... That looked to be a direct hit, good shooting, Deadwood. We were not making friends when we first started, so... God help us. We've got ten months left, and it will be brutal. We had to be perfect. On this day, it was a day mission, we were just to follow several Chinooks as they made it to the different FOBs dropping off different things and people. Yeah, Deadwood 6-3, uh, coming in from the West. We'd like to uh, open up their range, give it a sweep here. Roger that. We're flying across the Gardez Desert. I was looking around and just at that point... ...I was thinking, "Jesus, what is wrong?" It was like a solid rush of heat. Something's going wrong here, something... I wanna get out of the helicopter. The Apache helicopter went down while trying to land at the Montgomery County Airport. Jeez, we're roasting across the desert floor at 120 knots. If I just get out of here, all I gotta do, all I gotta do is just... - Maybe just open the door and jump out... - jump out. Daniel Flores' chopper went down. I got a hotspot under my helmet, I gotta change my helmet here. I gotta move my helmet around. Jesus, I gotta get out of here. How did I even drive home? My wife will wake me up any minute now. And I'm like Jesus. Just take a deep breath. Just take a deep breath. I gotta get out of here. This is... Just take a deep breath. That was my first bout of what would later become claustrophobia, anxiety and anxiety attacks that go with it. That was the first time I'd ever experienced something like that. Somewhere in the crumpled metal of the Apache helicopter lies a clue as to what made it fall from the sky. We set up to do traffic patterns. I was doing the flying from the front seat. Just as I was about to reduce power to land to the approach end of runway 1-4, a Learjet calls up on the radio saying, "Montgomery County traffic, this is Learjet 6-5 Charlie. We are four mile final for runway 1-4." I was thinking, "Yeah, this guy is gonna be bearing down on us pretty fast". So as I'm starting to slow down, even more to land, Tommy's thinking the same thing. He took the flight controls, and we went forward a little bit. That's the last thing I remember. Less than five minutes after take-off, the chopper fell to the ground, it's landing gear mired in the mud. Chief warrant officers, Daniel Flores and Thomas Einhorn were shaken up in the crash. Both were taken to Medical Center Hospital in Conroe, put under observation, then released. How did I survive? Literally by the grace of God. That was in August when I had that first bout of anxiety. I went and saw the flight surgeon. He... I told him what was going on. He worked with me a little bit, not much. He just said, "You, uh, you gotta learn to live with it, or you want me to take you off flight status?" And there was no way I could do that. So... I did what we all do in the military. I fought through it. On that day, early October 2006, we had already set the aircraft up, as we call them, we cocked them up for the QRF, quick reaction force. We'd just sit around and wait for the radios to come alive, to go help somebody. We were in the chow hall and our Icom radios came to life. The Apache crew Deadwood launch the QRF right now. We all looked at the radio, going like, "Are they serious? This has never happened before." We ran across the flight line. The other Apache on the QRF, they were already sitting at 100 percent RPMs, waiting for me. Clear right, clear left. Clear. We were stationed at Bagram at the time. Most of our QRF missions were just escorting Medivacs. So, it was a little odd that we were actually dispatched to a firefight in the Tagab valley, because as far as we know, at the time, the Tagab was quiet. October 14th was our first mission to roll down through the Valley of Tagab, and meet with the senior members of the village, and conduct a jirga. And we were also taking along a donation of, um, school supplies, that we were gonna pass along to the children of the village. I had turned 50 in 2006. And I arrived in Afghanistan. I was not assigned to a unit. I was a forces command fill, because they needed embedded tactical trainers, ETTs. The job as an ETT, as an embedded tactical trainer is... you're supposed to embed with the Afghan army, and you... you liaise between the US military and the Afghan military. We were two-man teams, one officer and one senior enlisted. "Hall and Best, you go over there and you guys report to your unit", and we reported, and they said, "Okay, you guys are just gonna be paired up." It's total happenstance. You would have these teams embedded and 100 to 200 Afghan national army personnel, you know. Because only once you've got them sufficient to where they could secure and govern themselves, could we leave. When we left Nijrab, my vehicle was commanded by Lieutenant Hall, he was sitting in the team chiefs' seat, and then I was the gunner in the, uh, turret. And we had Naser as our interpreter in the back, with radios to allow us to communicate with the Afghan forces that we were working with. I was a civilian contractor. When I was working with the coalition forces and NATO, my position was an interpreter, and I was doing language services. Naser was, was one of those kids who loves his country so much, he loves Afghanistan so much... ...that he did whatever he could to help out. It wasn't about the paycheck with him. It was all about helping his country. In Afghanistan, in the villages as soon as the light's up and after prayer, they open up shop and they close when they wanna close. Uh, so, when we were going down through, no shops were open. As we moved through the little village of Afghania, we noticed that the kids weren't out there waving, giving us thumbs up. We started seeing women and children running from the fields. We continued on up the road and there was an Afghan National Police post that you could always see Afghan National Police walking on top of. The building was completely abandoned. So that kind of put your Spidey senses on tingle a little bit. As we roll past that post, the Afghan commander stopped the vehicle and was calling Naser, our interpreter on the radio, and telling us to stop. Uh, so, I asked them what's going on. He said, "Enemy, enemy". Stop right here. The Afghan commander comes out, he walked out, he snatched the Dragon off Sniper Rifle. He stuck it into a hole in a compound. And he gets back out and smiles and looks at me and goes, "Two. I got two." That's when I learned... what it sounds like to get shot at. I began returning fire, and Lieutenant Hall called back to the rear American vehicle to alert them that we were... we had troops in contact. Big, long combo right, nine, ten vehicles, something like that. The front three or four are the ones getting engaged right now. I'm lieutenant, I have a captain, uh, in the Humvee to my rear. Their radio's not working or something, so he gets out and starts running up to us, bounding and hopping. And, uh, he comes up to say, "Hey, what's going on?" And that's when I kinda give him the situation. Hey, get some guns up high. When I turned my face, I saw, uh, the rounds were hitting in the Humvees. Four, shot to four o'clock. The whole time I'm trying to call for air support. Deadwood 6-7, Deadwood 6-7, this is Vandal 1-6, over. I know if I can get some Apaches, they come with rockets, big guns and they can s... They come with elevated positions. Zero-five, 0-5, 6-7 to the blind and 8-4. You don't wanna send one aircraft out on its own ever. That was policy at the time, in case one goes down, you wanna have somebody else there to be able to provide support for 'em. Stay up high down in there. When they dispatch us to these situations, all we get is a brief, "Troops in contact at this grid location. Here's a radio frequency, go make contact with them and help them." Vandal 0-5, Vandal 0-5, this is Deadwood 6-7 to the blind and Deadwood 8-4 inbound here rotations. Their front seaters got put in their coordinates to the entrance, to the Northern entrance of the Tagab Valley. Where what we call, we're buster, we're going as fast as we can. Military power. We didn't have any intelligence, you know, on, you know, who these guys were or what their... what their mission actually was at the time. We knew we were supposed to go talk to a Vandal 1-6, which was Lieutenant Hall and escort him back, uh, back to their base. Any Vandal elements, any Vandal elements. This is Deadwood 6-3. All these people on the trail to the right. From the time we launched, to the time we got to the north end of the Tagab, was all of 15 minutes at the most. Those guys had already been in a protracted fight for easily two hours before we got called out. They were getting surrounded by the Taliban. Deadwood 6-7, is that 1-6, we are in convoy, uh, to evac out of here. OK, coming in high? Big guy roger, are you still in contact at this time? From the standpoint of a helicopter pilot, one of these things is just like all the others. It's a lot more of a significant experience for the guys who are actually on the ground swapping bullets with the bad guys, back and forth. 5-3-3-7, this is 5-3-0, coming hard now, coming hard. And where's it at? Man, where the fuck are they? Fuck, they're shooting at us from the trail. - And where's it at? - Now we're getting hit from our two o'clock. The Afghans came out and tried to envelop us on both sides, kinda like a bull's horns, and tried to enclose us in and circle us on both sides. Now the Afghans, they fight hard and they fight with no body armor, they fight with no pay, no socks, some of them don't have boot laces, I mean, they... they fight hard. It was kinda inspiring to, to work with these Afghan guys who, who did so much for so little. Damn! I'm out. Gonna need more rounds, need more rounds. Terry's in the gun shooting, he's focused on, uh, firing rounds and suppressing the enemy. I thought to myself, because the Mark 19 had a lot of them, "Maybe that will be the next target". I yelled at them to move, move, move from that place. Move, move forward. That was an RPG. After they moved, fortunately, uh, they had that place with the RPG, but the, uh, Humvee was not there. And that was our ride back also to go to the base. So, uh, to make sure we don't have to walk. Ceasefire! Ceasefire! Ceasefire! Over about a 45-minute period, we were able to quell the contact. We thought the fight is finished. One of the company commanders, he sent one of his platoon soldiers with the squad to go down see the damages. When those people came back, they brought the flag of the Taliban, which was on top of one of the compounds. So we're just taking some photos. The Taliban already had the Afghan army radio scanned. They was listening the Afghan army communications on their radio. One of the Taliban guy, maybe their leader or one of their men, he called the call sign of the platoon Sargent when he answered, and respond, "Yes", and he start, uh... Uh, sorry to say that, he said, "We're gonna fuck you guys up." Target in! At this point, we still had integrity of our convoy, with an American vehicle in the lead, uh, followed by five Afghan vehicles, and then an American vehicle. The senior person on this convoy was in the rear vehicle. And he asked Lieutenant Hall to have our vehicle maintain our position while they moved up. Some of his people got out, Captain got out, went to aggress and move to another building. Move, move, move! Hey, watch your rifle, Lee! They got shot on, leave it, leave it don't touch. - Oh my God, dude. - Where's Gus! We need air support. We had been calling for the Apaches for three hours. Now we were running out of ammo, running out of fuel, and... but I was so focused on what was going on, uh, I didn't really worry about what could happen if they didn't come. I'm out a little bit further. We get over the northern end of the Tagab Valley, and, uh, we're circling, circling would seem like... Oh man, at least 30 minutes. I see smoke in the one o'clock, about two miles. Okay, we're, uh, armed. We're armed all the way around. Deadwood 6-7, do you have eyes on the Humvee, over? There's a couple of Humvees. Vandal 1-6, Vandal 1-6, this is Deadwood 6-7, over east now. This is your location Sure enough, we find a convoy that was engaged on an orchard on the other side of a ravine. Vandal 1-6, just give us the direction where you're taking fire from, we can put down some fire. Roger, Deadwood 6-7, 8-1. God dammit, do you have eyes on our location, over? We've got eyes on several along the roadway, uh, kind of hiding behind a wall. Roger, Deadwood 6-7, that's us in the Humvee, over. Okay, here is the situation, what you need is to put fire on them. Roger, they are in the orchard to our east. - Anything you can fire up in there will be granted. - Roll it out, rolling. He's trying to direct us where we need to put fire down on. It's a little more difficult for us during the day to identify specifically where they're being attacked from, because, you know, at night time you can see where the rounds are coming off, you can see where the fires are coming from, uh, you can utilize the flare, but it's more difficult during the day, 'cause you're primarily using your naked eye. Roger and there's smoking going on over here that could be a village, and the orchard to the east that you're talking about. Roger that, 6-7, that's go ahead and fire that up. Okay, we're gonna put down so fire. Alright, go ahead. That was some good shooting right there that kicked up all the dirt. Yep, I saw it. OK, let's come around. Coming around Are you gonna fire rockets... Yeah, I'm gonna try and fire rockets on this. Okay, you fire rockets and then I'll clean up a gun. I got the gun now. Finger's on the trigger. - Follow our guys a little bit and shoot into it. - Okay - Eh, come on, right. - Alright, coming right. 6-1 to... OK, fire when you... 1-6 and 1-6 That's when Vandal gets on the radio saying like, "Who are you guys shooting at? We are a convoy at the south end of the Tagab." "We're all standing behind this wall and shooting to our east, is that what you're seeing?" He says, "Yeah. It... Every shooting to the east". I'm, "Well, that's us, but I don't see you." 6-7, Deadwood 6-7. I believe we are south of your location, over. - Hold up on this round. - Alright, holding up. Roger that. He said they're south of our location. 6-1, see what these guys are doing right here. - Deadwood 6-7 - Get ready. Go ahead. W-D-5-8-1-5-5- 6-0-4-3-0. Roger. Good copy. I was talking to, uh, Lieutenant Hall on the radio, the radio reception was crystal clear, but we were not supporting him. He was... What? Five or seven kilometers maybe further south of where we were. Oh my God, who did we just shoot? Shoot. There were three Afghans that were hurt. - Over here! I saw two police! - Where, where? The Captain got on the radio and he called for a Medivac. The Medivac indicated that they would push one up, but they would not land until the area was secure. So the Captain indicated to Lieutenant Hall that he was taking half the Afghans in the ambulance and they were gonna roll back to combat output in Nijrab. "And you continue the fight." Lieutenant Hall indicated he did not think it was a good idea. I was, uh, very vocal from my position that it was an absolutely horrible idea. They needed to understand they still had ten people pinned down. They took away a big gun, on top of that Humvee is a 50-cal. We have a Mark 19, an automatic grenade launcher. You split those up, and you don't have anybody to cover for him while he's reloading. Reload. I'm out. I need more rounds. You don't choose who leads you in those situations. They get force-fed to you, and my job as an enlisted soldier, is to mitigate the mistakes they make. The shots are coming from right below us. They left us with only one American vehicle and the American vehicles were out there because we had the most fire power, and because we could communicate with the skies. So, this was a month after my first real deal claustrophobic anxiety attack. There's trails and everything down here, they could be hiding in all those trees. It was on the back of my mind. If I had a moment to stop and reflect... Yeah, here it comes. Deadwood 6-7, we are in convoy, we need evac out of here. And that's when I started realizing, that as long as I can keep my mind preoccupied with something else, yeah, the chances of having an anxiety attack was much, much less. - Roger, Deadwood 7-6, I'm right underneath you. - Roger. What we actually wound up flying over first was a ground QRF force, that had been sent out from their base to go help them. And so we supported those guys at first for a good 10-15 minutes or so, before we realized this is not where we're supposed to be. Deadwood 6-7, we are in the last vehicle in this convoy. Roger, we have eyes on you. As soon as they got over the orchard where the fighting was going on, sure enough there was a volley of RPGs and smoke from all the shooting. I quickly slammed the stick to the left, lined up my rockets and fired off three high explosive rockets. Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. And I tell you, right now, that felt great. Come on back. Going in look good at this point. Go around, you're in a good position, over. Here we go. RPG, 0-8. Yeah! Deadwood 6-7, we are still receiving fire from our inside, over. north and south so we get a little more to run. Yes, and that way he's coming in that direction. - I agree with them. Coming out - OK. - 6-1 is inbound - Roger. - Okay. - Good round, Deadwood 6-7 you're right on target. Okay, 6-7, roger. We had all our Afghans in the trenches, so we had to get everybody, find them all with no radios. Get them all back in the vehicles and I'm calling, I'm trying to talk to the Afghans and I don't know, I don't know Dari, so I'm trying to find my interpreter, and he's up on the front line, you know, taking ammo to the Afghans. I had to call him and... and provide cover fire for him to start bounding back to me, and I had to grab him by the collar and... and try to yell at him, "Hey, I need you with me, man. I need you to stay with me." We finally got everybody together, you know, we started, started to move out. Deadwood 6-7, we are loading up to evac out of here, over. Roger. There was about 500 enemy insurgents in the valley at that time. When we came down, all the... the enemy insurgents decided to come out to the road because they knew we'd have to come back, and they laid in probably seven, eight ambushes for us along those 17 kilometers. Roger, Deadwood 6-7, we are in route and we are gonna have ambushes all the way home. - OK, we're going with 'em. - OK, we stay with 'em. Roger won't be, uh, location as you are north. I could see that they were starting to head north along the road. I rolled in, flying as fast as I could, catching up the convoy, and roasted over them at about 100 feet, to let them know that we were with them, and for any other possible ambushes in front of them to know that there's Apaches that are protecting our guys on the ground. Do you copy, 1-6. The next village they came up to, looked literally like an old western town, with a dirt road down the middle. It was a tight one lane road, with buildings on either side. That's when Vandal 1-6 screams down the radio that they're shooting from the rooftops. - Rooftops, get down! Over. - Shit! They were literally putting the gun over the edge and just squeezing the trigger and letting, letting them fly. We can take out that house. That's where they were shooting them from. I'm checking to see where the shots came from. I was in a position right there, just above the town, saw one building and I thought, "Alright, I'm fixing to put a rocket right through the top of it." Okay, we're armed, we're armed all the way around. But it didn't feel right. - He's got nowhere to go if he get shot at. - Yeah, yeah. - Alright, just get ready. - Roger. I eased off and circled around, I thought, "Alright. Give them a little bit of time before I go make a shot and possibly kill innocents in there." Because it's still, it's a country where normal people that don't wanna be in this war. That's where they live. So, in my mind, that was a good... a good decision not to take that shot. He's pointing that way somewhere, what the heck? Those guys are right in front of us. Vandal to Deadwood. Roger. See if there's anybody down there as well. I'm looking and lost. So that's when I started making runs up and down the road, popping flares to let people know that, "You mess with them, we will level this town". - I'll send some flares. - Go ahead. Roger. Power. Speed. And flares away. We're throwing flares everywhere. The Afghans stopped because they're taking fire, and they got out of the vehicles to try and engage. Deadwood 6-7, we have - We are loading up to evac out of here, over. - Roger. They were out fighting, because they didn't wanna be in their vehicles, so we get them back in the vehicles and we start moving again. 2-40! Oh fuck! Go ahead! We need airborne! We need airborne! We were close to being black on ammo, meaning that we were out of ammo. I had used all my Mark 19 rounds, so the guys in the skies had the only rounds that were really being fired. Considering how many people were stacked up against them, they were sitting ducks. The FOB was not even a mile away and that's when Vandal 1-6 yells out, "They're shooting from the fields, they're shooting from the field." 6-7, 6-7 They're in the fields, in the fields. Over. They're in the fields, 6-7, in the fields. Roger, in the fields. I got it, it's gonna be a tight turn backing up. Right down below us, 6-7, right down below us. My front seater saw somebody run into the fields shooting. - Here we go. You see 'em? - Yep. I didn't see 'em. Good shot, 6-7, good shot. I got it, alright, coming left. - Left. - Yeah, take a left turn, I saw the guys on the ground. We'd gotten so good at this point with shooting rockets that I could put a rocket in a window at a mile away. No problem. Alright, straight on. - Oh, nice. - Right there, there you go. I'm out of, I'm out of... Good round, 6-7, good round. - Roll out. - Alright out. By about that time the convoy made up the last hill to the FOB. 6-7, it's 1-6, we are in the FOB, over. If we would not have shown up at the time that we did, the chances are they would have had a lot more casualties if not all of them getting killed. They secured our safe passage out of that valley. I mean we shot a lot of ordinance that day, in those, in those three and a half hours. Terry brought 700 rounds of grenades, 700 grenades that he shot. The Afghan are an amazing fighting force and, uh, Matt is the best battle buddy I've ever had. If we would have had to run back through that gauntlet, without cover fire, who knows how many people would have made it back. We saved them that day, we saved them that day. We got back that night and... And we had flat tires and we had no ammo. We were tired, and there was a point where I... you know, I sat on a berm and just kinda looked out into the distance. You know, I needed a minute. And, uh, Naser came up and sat down and I said, "Hey, you know, I... we fired a lot of grenades, and we fired a lot of guns and, we, we shot a lot of things, and... Uh, I'm sure we killed some bad guys, but I'm worried that we... Uh, that we killed, you know, maybe, maybe women and children. I don't know. And he kind of put his hand on my shoulder and said, "We did good today." You know? "We did, we did good, you did good today." That was huge. That little ten seconds probably saved a lot of, a lot of therapy and issues for me later in life. Got us here in the nick of time. You know, this is a whole lot of lightning going on. And actually it's fixing to rain like crazy on us here in just a second. We need, gonna get on a Hawk, to get back in this thing, and here it comes. Um, like I said, we didn't... we didn't make it. This is just like Jurassic Park, so as long as we don't move, we should be okay. But it's raining like crazy and we are, in bad guy country. Dust off, the other Apache and us. I'm expecting a T-rex any minute now, so we're not moving. And I'm scared. Signing out for now. - Ahem, Chris, it's 2006. - Hey. And what are we doing, all of us from Texas? Shoveling snow. - Snow! - You'd think we lived in Amarillo. That's true. Anyway, sometime in the middle of the afternoon, it's snowing like crazy. And it's been snowing all night, all... our Christmas. We had two weeks left before we would start packing up and heading home after a yearlong battle there in Afghanistan. The fighting had increased tremendously. At the morning brief, we got the weather for the day, and we got all the missions that were going out. One of the missions that I'd heard was taking The Code to the Korengal Valley in a Black Hawk to go visit the FOBs. The Code is the General. I was gonna spend Christmas Eve of 2006 with Captain McKnight and his company, up in the Korengal outpost. We had been collecting all these letters... ...to see the smiles on troops faces when they open a "to any soldier" letter, it just makes a huge difference. Completely socked in, snow, fog, everything. I told my aide, "Alright, we're gonna go New Year's Eve. And snowed out, fogged out. And January 5th, 2007 was a crystal-clear day. Alright, okay. Flight brakes released, panels in, lock lights on. - System check? - Systems, I got no crosses, no transfers. We're full of gas, are green, 3000 hydraulics, no caution or warnings. Supporting systems are checked. We're good. The Korengal Valley was the most hotly contested valley in all of Afghanistan. The Valley of Death is what some people called it. Asher, I hear we're on the back side of the. And we started heading to the east towards Jalalabad and then north to Asadabad. Two types of people that troops often talk about regarding who you'll find in a firefight, are those that will immediately return fire or initiate fire, because their training kicks in and they execute, and then, you have some that are more contemplative and take a step back and, and hesitate, but I didn't see too many of those. What I saw mostly were troops that whenever, uh, we needed fire on target, uh, rounds on target. They would put it on target, and there's no greater demonstration of that than that January 5th, 2007 day. Dog 3-7, Deadwood 6-6. Deadwood 6-6, Dog 3-7 read your over. 0-1-6-6, hear you loud and clear. We're about one minute out. Dog, copy that one minute out. We got radio traffic saying that there's a troops in contact, a fight going on in the Pech River Valley, right before the Korengal Valley. So, we had to land at Asadabad to let that fight play out, because we could not go past there. At that point, The Code gets out, the Black Hawk runs into the TOC and a second later, they call us up on the radio saying like, "Deadwood, can you go over there to that TIC, and help stop it so we can go on to the Korengal valley." I probably said like, "We're the only Apache out here, we're not allowed to go single ship anywhere in this country." And right about then is when the TOC called up saying, "The Code has just authorized you to go single ship." OK, copy. Be looking for them. So, we took off, talked to Dog 3-7 on the ground and he said, "Up on this ridge line, the entrance of the Shuryak Valley, there's, uh, somebody's shooting at 'em with RPGs and some, you know, small arms fire." Hey, Dog this is Deadwood 6-6, where are you at from me right now? Is that you, uh, are you on the main road? Dog 3-7, negative, we are at control base. We are east of you right now, as you're flying, over. Okay, uh, let's right now. Fly to is in, and they just gave us southeast of that. Dog 3-7 to Deadwood 6-6. Dog 3-7, over. Yes, that last coordinate that you gave me, is that friendly or enemy? That's enemy. You are safety. Over. Deadwood 6-6, roger. Okay, that's enemy position. Just run on the nose, right there somewhere. And some rockets. This spot level, I don't like, but it looks like somebody come back to get 'em. No, that is not working. And that's when the, the gun stopped shooting. We could hear it cycling, but no bullets were coming out. - Can't be out of rounds already. - No way. Sounds like the gun was running, but it wasn't firing. Oh Jeez. OK, Dog 3-7, Deadwood 6-6, either we're out of bullets or our gun is broken. We're gonna get back to ABAD and continue with the mission, we'll be back in a little bit. This is Dog 3-7, copy, over. At that point, we went back to Asadabad. The crew chiefs on the ground there, at Asadabad, said like, "Hey, do you need any fuel?" And I said, "No, but could you check the gun, see if it's broke or not?" So, they open the avionics bay and they check the gun, and sure enough, we're just out of bullets. So the kid comes back with a big ammo can of 30 millimeter, and then they look at us and that's when we find out that they don't have the proper equipment to load the 30 millimeter bullets into the Apache. Unbeknownst to us, that was taken away a week ago. Bullets, going into the Korengal Valley was an absolute necessity. We had to have bullets. So, I suggested, "Hey, how about if we fly back down to Jalalabad here, and, uh, get our guys to put bullets in our Apache, refill us with gas, and we'll be back up here 45 minutes tops, and then we can go on into the Korengal." At that point I saw the... the Code getting out of the TOC, and running and getting into his Black Hawk. And right at that point, Ark Angel gets on the radio and says like, "Hey, you guys. The Code's ready to go. You've got rockets and missiles, let's go." 5-3-7, roger. I just got word that the General says that you have to have an escort with you, over. - Alright. - Dog 3-7 copy, over. This really sucks not having... us going in here. So, I took off, Ark Angel, the Black Hawk with the Code, takes off right behind me. Rolling straight into the Korengal Valley. Korengal outpost, Lumberyard, this is Deadwood 6-6, getting down with the Code. This is Lumberyard COP control, copy that, over. I call up the Lumberyard, or Korengal outpost, or the COP, tell 'em that, uh, it's Deadwood inbound with the Code. Go in, take left turn now, I'm at your right five o'clock high. Roger that. Uh, don't go any further south, make a left turn now, make a left turn now. Yeah, pick up your speed fast as you can, really not good up here. We're moving out at a pretty good clip because we know that there's enemy in the area. Holes started appearing in the side of the helicopter, which, you know, either rivets are popping or somebody's shooting at us and of course, it was the latter. And the left engine catches on fire as we're landing, uh, hard landing inside the Korengal outpost. So, they're on the ground dropping off the Code and the package and whatever else they had, and I'm circling overhead and Lessum and myself, my copilot, were discussing like, "Okay, we'll go back to Jalalabad, get some bullets in this helicopter, and that should be about the time we come back to pick up the... the Code." All he's gotta do is drop off and we go back to Abad. Yeah, as far as we know that's all he's doing. You know, we ought to, I don't know how much time they've got, but, I think we can run down to ABAD, and get, get bullets. Would be nice, wouldn't it? At that point, they came under attack. Oh my god! Now we're in full-fledged ambush. There's rocket, propel grenades, criss-crossing like Roman Candles. Open it up, open it up! And there's machine gun rounds coming in. Eh! Captain McKnight comes running up and, and grabs me by the body armor and says, "Sir, the last thing I need is a dead general in my base camp." Go, get out, get out! Coming down the hill, the young man named Sergeant Vile. And Sergeant Vile gets shot. He gets up, ties up his own tourniquet and we all go piling into the command post, be that what it was. The Korengal outpost was under pretty significant contact at this time. Here you go. And I'm watching Sergeant Vile, who is starting to go into shock. But he was a mortar ballistic computer operator, he had a very important job. He has a radio and he's punching numbers into his mortar ballistic computer, and his left arm was severely wounded. There was blood dripping on the plywood floor. I tapped the medic and say, "You need to check him out, he's getting ready to go into shock". Because he was visibly shaking. And, uh, the medic sort of smirked at me and says, "You don't know Sergeant Vile, sir." And I said, "That may be, but, you know, he looks like he's gonna...", and so... The medic goes over, I guess not wanting to upset the General and Sergeant Vile turns at him and growls, you know, and get the F away from me. And this is, you know, the beauty of the American soldier is that he didn't wanna let his teammates down. At this point, there's a string of bullets coming at me between myself and Ark Angel. Oh shit, what was that? There, they are right there. I rolled in hard left, and I thought, "Jeez, I have no bullets." At that point, I could not go to our rocket shops because the Korengal outpost was right on the other side. - See that smoke right there? - Yeah, shit. Yeah, you're taking fire, just, uh, I don't know if you saw it, it was left low. I squeezed over and I said, "I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you." Shoved the helicopter over into a negative G push, squeezed that trigger. - It was right there. Right there, right there. - Woah! Come on. Nothing was coming out, I was in a one and a half negative G push. The safety inhibit on the Apache keeps me from firing rockets at that point. You could see flashes of everybody shooting at us from that ridgeline. Was like the paparazzi was right in front of us. I pull back on the stick at that time to get out of a stream of gunfire coming at me. That's when I saw my... my wife and my kids at the front of the door of our house... ...thinking that... "How could dad have gotten killed with less than two weeks left?" And then I looked and I saw my daughter smiling saying, "No, uh... It's not gonna happen." My copilot says, "Daniel, you're hyperventilating." That was the point where like I thought, "No stop." Finally, I breathe again. So now, I'm trying to line up the nose and trying to get at least a half a positive G to get a rocket out. Fuck, fuck, fuck. And sure enough by the grace of God, I fire one rocket and it goes right, center mass. Combat Main, Combat Main. They were just shooting at us underneath me right now. Combat main, they were just shooting at us, just now. Did you see 'em? That was a big gun. Yeah, I saw some big traces coming around here. It was a big machinegun shooting traces out of the next spot and we were not allowed to shoot. Come back around, screaming on the radio, telling the Korengal outpost, "We're taking fire from this spot. Get a fire mission going." You hear the loud funk of the mortar go off. The hang time's probably about a minute. It's just silent in there except from some of the machinegun rounds coming in. But nobody was talking and you hear the explosion. The machinegun rounds stop. Vile gets confirmation of a first round direct hit. He pushes the mortar ballistic computer across the picnic table to his private. He turns to the medic and he says, "Now you can work on me." At that point, I could see the Taliban running on the ridgeline. Deadwood 6-6, we're engaged right now, we got them, we got them straight in front of us. And that's just when I begin to fire as fast as I could, all the rockets I could, and actually remembering a World War II pilot that I know, saying, "Wiggle the pedals back and forth a little bit, that way all your rockets won't end up in one spot". I wiggled the pedals just a little bit right and left, as I'm squeezing the rockets and making my rockets hit everywhere around them. - Fucking... - There we go. Deadwood 6-6, we got up on that spot. Combat Main. Lumberyard, permission to. Swing back around again, we're running out of high explosive rockets. We start shooting flechettes, 2000 two-inch nails coming at those guys ripping into them. After that, run out of flechettes, come back around and I start shooting white phosphorous. At that point, I have nothing left. I call the... the, uh, Korengal outpost, tell them like, "We are Winchester. We are out of here." - Alright, Deadwood 6-6, Winchester, we're out of here. - Roger that, over. Fuck, why wouldn't that rocket shoot on that first run? Damn it, that pisses me off. And no gun. Dammit of all the... Oh yeah, of all the times not having a fucking gun, man. Yes. The heroism of both the Black Hawk crew and the, uh, Apache crew, was just unbelievable. They stayed on station when it was so risky, so dangerous, to help the troops on the ground. Alright, you sure you guys did not take a hit cause they were shooting all over you. Yeah 1-32, we took a hit, our generator's out and our stabilizers out. We're totally viable but we're gonna have to shut down and take a look at it when we get to ABAD. We're gonna have to fly around and get another aircraft for. Sounds good. Much later that evening, they sent, uh, another Black Hawk out to recover my team and me. You know, I had five other stops I was gonna make that day, but that, that sort of changed the whole dynamic of the visit and so all the "to any soldier", uh, packages and letters, they all stayed right there. We put Sergeant Vile on our aircraft and medivacked him to Bagram. And before he got evacked, I pinned on his purple heart. He's a personal hero of mine today. This was the best teamwork I've ever seen. It was completely unrehearsed, it was all instinctual. These pilots knew what to do, the soldiers knew what to do. It was one of those days where I was never prouder to be an American fighting soldier. Because everybody did their job above and beyond the call of duty, and avoided what really could have been a catastrophic type of event. It was just an incredible sight to see. It was a, a moment a few years ago when he had, uh... tweaked his elbow pretty bad and he was in a cast, and we were all just sitting in here watching TV one night, and he just started sweating profusely and got up and just... pacing around the room and cussing saying, "I need to get out of this, I need to get out of this cast right now, they need to take this off." 'Cause he was having an anxiety attack from being claustrophobic. Then I started to think about it more and looking back at like, when we were in Colorado and packed into that gondola, packed in the long car rides where you would start to notice he's a little off about something, but he's trying to hide it, but he can't just quite do it. It did humanize him a little bit to see him act this way, you know, have this episode. But, uh, for the most part, I mean, it was maybe two minutes of that, and then he calmed right back down, and just sat back down and said, "Alright, I need to call the doctors tomorrow, tell 'em to help me out with this", and then, we just went right back to watching whatever we were watching. For a while there it was pretty intense and with the cast thing, like Eric was talking about earlier, on his arm, that surprised me also. I really never have even thought about something like that. I was thinking more of, you know, the gondola, being in an enclosed space, kind of made sense to me, but having something on your arm, didn't really make any sense, why that would bother him. He wrote this book and it, you know, maybe thousands of people are gonna read and he's talking about it just like it's a normal thing, but he... didn't quite talk about it to everyone at home. And, uh, it was a little off-putting, you know, reading it, but I mean, you understand it's a part of it and it's a part of the story that he needs to tell. - Hey, you must be Matt. - I'm Matt, nice to meet you. - Good to meet you, Ross Hovey. - Hey Ross. - Ross, man. - Good to see you, brother. - It's been a while. - Yeah, great to see you. And who are these guys? Naser, my buddy. How are you? Good to see you, Ross. - Naser, I'm Daniel, nice to meet you, brother. - I'm Terry. Terry, nice to meet you, man, it's been years. - Yeah, I know, for sure. - And you were the translator, is that right? - I was the translator. - OK, yeah. That is too good, and he was the door guy or... I was the gunner up top the Mark 19. - He was the gunner, he was backseat and I was the TC. - Alright. - So, Vandal 1-6. - Yep. 1-7. - And Naser. - I was relaxing in the backseat. He was handing the rounds up to me. That's pretty good, I like that. Yeah. Well guys, you wanna just step inside the bar, we can just hang out, grab a... grab a cold drink if you'd like? A toast to our Afghanistan team, our army family and friends and all those that didn't get to come back. That didn't make it home safe. I remember that captain, from the 2-6 cab, he said like, "Guys, everything's heating up there in the Korengal and the Pech, but don't forget the Tagab, 'cause it is about to explode and, uh, I thought ah, whatever. Same thing, flew over it all year long. Two months after that, I've forgotten what he's said and then all of a sudden one day we're on QRF and they say, "We gotta take a tog out", and I'm like, "Really? There's something going on? There's firefighting in the Takab?" I say, "There's a convoy that's been ambushed, and there's 200 Taliban out there that are surrounding them." I can't remember how long it was, but it had to have been five to ten minutes we were supporting that QRF team. And that it? It felt like five hours. I thought the same thing too. I... I was looking up to the sky, I'm like, "You guys are saying, 'Hey I'm dropping rounds.'" I'm like, "I don't see you, let alone your rounds." That's hit me in the leg. Like you were saying, there were ambushes all the way up there. - Yeah, you didn't shoot anybody... - That didn't need shooting. ...that were up to good. They were actually after our QRF. We were in the business of killing and right then, business was good. All I could tell was, that there was American made vehicles with A&A men in them and they were under attack. Yeah, we started moving up and as we started moving up, uh, you know, it was literally seven different ambushes waiting for us. They were laying on top, not accurate firing, but to hide themselves in firing, when we got back, I had a 8k round in between my vest and my dune. - Wow! - That's I mean, so you know we were like, "Oh my gosh". - Holy mackerel! - And yeah, they were, it was crazy. God bless the A&A, they would always leave us in the Humvee sick. We had... I had to get Naser out and say, tell them to move up, move up, move up. One of the Taliban, he already... he was like, uh, the radio channel of the enemy because he was scanning the communication. He called one of the sergeants, which he called me, he took his handset, he answered, "Yes". Oh yeah? He said, "I'm gonna fuck you all up." So, all you guys alive, that's what the Taliban said. - Wow, it's just... - Kudos.
