Narrator: THEY‘RE THE \hSTUFF OF NIGHTMARES. \hGIANT SNAKES OF IMMENSE STRENGTH. WITH A STRIKE FASTER THAN \h\h\hTHE BLINK OF AN EYE. [HISSING] AFRICAN ROCK PYTHON‘S... A BATTERY OF FINELY TUNED \h\h\hTRACKING SENSORS... THE BETTER TO FIND YOU WITH. ROWS OF RAZOR SHARP TEETH... THE BETTER TO GRIP YOU WITH. GIGANTIC... ANCIENT... \h\h\h\h\hAGGRESSIVE. [CHICKEN SQUAWKING] \h\h\h\hTHIS IS SQUEEZE, AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD ROCK PYTHON PROPELLED BY THE SAME PRIMORDIAL NEEDS THAT DROVE HER ANCESTORS IN THE DAYS WHEN DINOSAURS \h\h\h\hWALKED THE EARTH. SHE CAN HUNT IN ANY TERRAIN... \h\h\h\hAT ANY TIME OF DAY... FOR VIRTUALLY ANY PREY. BUT, SQUEEZE IS A MOTHER, SO \hOTHERS DEPEND ON HER TOO. ...

SQUEEZE IS COVERED IN THE \h\h\h\hYELLOW, CHESTNUT AND BROWN SPLOTCHES THAT \h\h\hHELP HER BLEND IN WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. SHE HASN‘T EATEN IN TWO WEEKS. \h\h\h\h\h\h\hFOR GOOD REASON. SHE‘S CARRYING A CLUTCH OF \h\hJUST-DEVELOPING EGGS. \hSHE CAN‘T EAT A BIG MEAL - NOT WHILE THEY‘RE GESTATING INSIDE. BUT SHE‘S HUNGRY; A SNACK \hWOULD BE JUST THE THING. SOMETHING THAT IN HER SLUGGISH \h\h\hSTATE MIGHT NOT REQUIRE A LOT OF WORK. SHE WAITS FOR NIGHTFALL. LIKE MOST SNAKES, THE ROCK \hPYTHON HAS POOR VISION, BUT THAT DOESN‘T MEAN \h\hIT CAN‘T FIND YOU. SQUEEZE CAN SENSE BODY HEAT - \h\hWITH INCREDIBLE ACCURACY. THE SCALES ON HER LIPS \h\hHAVE “PIT ORGANS” \h\h\h\hWHICH ARE FULL OF HEAT-SENSITIVE RECEPTORS. NERVES CARRY SIGNALS \hFROM THE RECEPTORS TO THE BRAIN WHERE THEY‘RE \hCONVERTED INTO IMAGES... LIKE GOLDILOCKS, SQUEEZE IS \h\h\hLOOKING FOR SOMETHING JUST THE RIGHT SIZE. NOT TOO SMALL... A FROG IS \hHARDLY WORTH THE EFFORT. NOT TOO BIG... IT WOULD BE HARD EVEN FOR A ROCK PYTHON TO SWALLOW A COW. BUT HERE‘S SOMETHING JUST RIGHT. THIS RABBIT HAS COME TO DINE \h\hON SOME TASTY CABBAGES. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE RABBIT, \h\h\h\h\h\h\hTHE CABBAGES... ARE PERFECT COVER FOR SQUEEZE. THE RABBIT‘S ACUTE HEARING \h\h\h\h\h\hIS LEGENDARY. \hBUT IT SEEMS OBLIVIOUS TO THE APPROACH OF THIS STEALTH HUNTER. [RABBIT BREATHING] ♪ RABBITS ARE FAST. SQUEEZE IS FASTER.

[SNAKE BREATHING] STRONG MUSCLES PUSH THE FOOD \hDOWN TOWARDS HER STOMACH. ♪ WHEN IT‘S ALL IN, TIME \h\h\h\hFOR A SIESTA. IN A SAFE PLACE. IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO \h\hDIGEST A WHOLE RABBIT - SHE‘LL BE VERY SLUGGISH \h\h\h\hFOR A FEW DAYS. A SLUGGISH SNAKE IS A \h\hVULNERABLE SNAKE. PYTHONS HAVE LIVED IN AFRICA \h\h\hFOR MILLIONS OF YEARS, LONG BEFORE HUMANS ARRIVED \h\h\h\h\h\hON THE SCENE. SPECIES COME AND GO, BUT THE PYTHON HAS A TALENT FOR SURVIVAL. THE SNAKE WE SEE TODAY \h\hHAS CHANGED LITTLE FROM ITS PREHISTORIC \h\h\h\hFOREBEARS... ITS AMONG THE WORLD‘S MOST \h\h\h\hPRIMITIVE SNAKES. ♪ THE SMALL THORN-LIKE PROJECTIONS ON THEIR LOWER BODY, KNOWN AS PELVIC SPURS, ARE \hTHOUGHT TO BE VESTIGES \hOF A TIME WHEN THESE ANIMALS HAD HIND LEGS. A PAIR OF HIND LEGS MIGHT \hACTUALLY COME IN HANDY RIGHT NOW, AS SHE‘S WEIGHED DOWN BY THE EGGS INSIDE HER. THEY‘VE GROWN TO THE POINT WHERE IT‘S HARD TO MAKE MUCH PROGRESS. EACH EGG WEIGHS ABOUT AS MUCH \h\h\h\h\hAS A BILLIARD BALL. THAT‘S AROUND 50 BILLIARD BALLS SHE‘S BEEN HAULING AROUND FOR WEEKS. [WATER FLOWS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] SHE‘S READY TO LIGHTEN HER LOAD, BUT SHE CAN‘T JUST DUMP \h\h\h\h\hTHEM ANYWHERE. [LEAVES CRUNCHING] SHE‘S BEEN SEARCHING FOR THE \h\h\hRIGHT SPOT FOR WEEKS. THIS HOLLOW AT THE BASE OF \h\hAN OLD SILVER OAK TREE COULD PROVIDE SHELTER \h\hFROM THE ELEMENTS, HIDE HER EGGS FROM PREDATORS, AND KEEP THEM AT A CONSTANT \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hTEMPERATURE. ♪ FOR AN ANIMAL CAPABLE OF SUCH \hMASSIVE DISPLAYS OF POWER, SHE CAN BE SURPRISINGLY \h\h\h\h\h\h\hMATERNAL. SHE ARRANGES HER EGGS IN A PILE AND COILS AROUND THEM TIGHTLY. OF ALL THE SNAKES IN THE WORLD, THE AFRICAN ROCK PYTHON \h\hIS ONE OF ONLY A FEW THAT ACTUALLY CARES FOR ITS YOUNG. ALL THE OTHERS SIMPLY LAY OR \h\h\hGIVE BIRTH AND LEAVE. WITHOUT HER PROTECTION, \hSQUEEZE‘S EGGS WOULD BE EASY PICKINGS FOR MONITOR LIZARDS AND MONGOOSES. SHE‘LL STAND GUARD FOR \h\hTHE NEXT 90 DAYS, LEAVING THE HOLLOW ONLY \h\h\hTO BASK IN THE SUN AND RETURN TO WARM HER EGGS \h\hWITH HER RE-HEATED BODY. EVERY DAY SHE GROWS \hA LITTLE WEAKER...

IT MIGHT NOT SEEM VERY \h\h\h\h\hLONG TO US, BUT TO THESE YOUNG SNAKES, \h\h\h\h\hIT‘S A GODSEND. \hFEW PREDATORS WILL MOVE ON A HATCHLING WHEN ITS WATCHFUL, 13 FOOT MOTHER IS COILED NEARBY. IT‘S A KIND OF PARENTAL CARE WE DON‘T ASSOCIATE WITH SNAKES, BUT THE ROCK PYTHON SEEMS TO BE AN INTRIGUING EXCEPTION \h\h\h\h\h\hTO THE RULE. ♪ BUT EVEN SQUEEZE HAS HER LIMITS: IF SHE DOESN‘T FEED SOON, \h\h\h\hSHE COULD STARVE. AND WHEN SHE SLITHERS \h\h\h\hOFF FOR GOOD, HER OFFSPRING WILL BE ON THEIR \h\h\h\h\hOWN - READY OR NOT. AND THE FOREST IS FULL \h\hOF WATCHFUL EYES. Narrator: AN ADULT AFRICAN ROCK PYTHON IS AN APEX PREDATOR; IT HAS LITTLE TO FEAR FROM OTHER ANIMALS IN THE WILD. BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID OF \h\h\h\h\h\hHATCHLING PYTHONS. \h\hTHEY HAVE MANY ENEMIES, INCLUDING VENOMOUS SNAKES - LIKE THE FOREST COBRA - AND BIRDS OF PREY - LIKE THE \h\h\h\h\hAFRICAN GOSHAWK. ♪ THEIR MOTHER CAN‘T PROTECT \h\h\h\h\h\hTHEM FOREVER.
