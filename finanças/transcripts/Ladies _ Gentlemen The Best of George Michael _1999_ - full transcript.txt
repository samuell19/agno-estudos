Please stay And I'm never gonna dance again Guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend I know you're not a fool I should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste the chance that I've been given So I'm never gonna dance again The way I danced with you, ooh Now that you're gone Now that you're gone Now that you're gone Was what I did so wrong? So wrong That you had to leave me alone?
