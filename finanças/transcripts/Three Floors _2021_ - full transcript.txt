THREE FLOORS We're locating the first available taxi, please stay on the line. We're locating the first available taxi, please stay on the line... Stop! Stop! Francesca! Come here. Take her. Careful of the glass, sweetheart. Andrea? He's all right, don't worry. I'm going to check on the woman. Andrea! Andrea, are you all right? Is Dad here too? Where is he? - No, Dad's with the woman. - What woman? He'll be right here, calm down. No, don't let him come, please. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. Madam? Madam? Can you hear me? How's Andrea? He's fine, don't worry, the doctors are on their way. - Here she is! - Thanks. We've got a lot to do, she might sleep better here. It's a pleasure for us, it'll be quieter here. I'll pick you up for school, sweetie. - Shall we? - Bye. Bye, thanks. You're doing great, Monica. Breathe, that's it. - It hurts here. - We're nearly there. You're doing really well. Shall we call the father in? Monica? No! My husband's not here. Breathe. That's it, good. Breathe. Teresa? Can you see me? I'm here. It's all right. U-turn! Careful, Francesca. - Shall we go? - Yes. What a strange horse... Francesca, let's go. No, one when you arrive, two when you leave. Thanks, Giovanna, just as well we've got you. Don't mention it! Francesca's so sweet, she cheers us up. Renato was so happy when our granddaughter was small, they always played together. It's a joy for him having children in the house. Let's go. Thank you. Renato's broken. Francesca! - What do you mean? - He always forgets everything. Like what? Where he puts his glasses, which remote is for the TV, sometimes he forgets his name and I have to remind him. Maybe he's just joking. No, no, he's broken. He's broken. Maybe we shouldn't leave her with him again. We need to find a babysitter. We're home. Here we are. "For Beatrice". It's for you, darling. I wonder what it is. It's a big gift, they've given you a big gift. Who's given you this huge gift? "Hello my little niece, I'm sure you're beautiful like your mom." "I hope to meet you very soon. Uncle Roberto". - I'm really touched. - I'm not. You know I don't want to have anything to do with my brother. But it was so kind of him. Is Beatrice asleep? Yes, she's so good. Come home soon, I hate being on my own. - You're not on your own. - Giorgio, don't get smart. - Come home soon. - Yeah, really soon. - I miss you so much. - Me too. - Bye, till tomorrow. - Bye. Excuse me. Hello? Hello, attorney, yes? Yes, yes... but when? That's fine, of course. We'll come and pick him up, thank you. At that point they made me get up, they forced me to follow them, they put a hood over my head and then they pushed me toward the stairs. I tripped. We went upstairs, I could hear them whispering. Our lawyer says there may be extenuating circumstances: the road's poorly lit, the crosswalk stripes are faded, they're almost invisible. The sentence might be lighter, maybe there are witnesses. If we could demonstrate that the responsibility isn't solely yours, that she appeared out of the darkness, right in front of you... That woman died and Andrea was drunk. Goodbye. Andrea? Come here a moment. Tell me if this is okay. "Dear Tommaso, Andrea can't reply directly to your email," "so I'm writing on his behalf." "He can't receive any visitors or speak on the phone." "But keep writing to him and tell his other friends to do the same." - "Andrea is happy to get your emails..." - How many years will I get? How many years? - Will I be in jail in Rome? - One thing at a time. First, there'll be a trial, we need to figure out what line to follow. What will I be charged with? Murder? Ten minutes? You sure? Okay. - Francesca, let's go. - Where? Mommy's on her way, do you want to wait at Renato's and Giovanna's? - Yes! Can I bring my coloring pencils? - Sure. Do you want these? Sara's stuck in traffic, I have to get to the gym. She'll be here in a few minutes. Giovanna will be home soon, too. She's not here? I brought my pencils, we can draw. Sure thing. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye, Mommy's on her way. Thank you, Renato. Don't mention it. See you later. Let's stay in second. Getting ready for third. Getting ready to go uphill. Three, two, one. I'm squeezing, going up. Pace. Hold that rhythm. Hold that rhythm. Pace. Ten seconds more. - Did she have a green hoodie? - I don't remember! Yeah, she had a green hoodie. - Was she wearing her coat, too? - No! She wasn't supposed to go out! Who are you talking to? So, what's going on? Where did you look? Why isn't Renato answering his phone? He didn't take it. Forgive me, I'm so sorry. He's so distracted at the moment. Recently I had to go looking for him, he got lost. Now you tell us? Don't worry, they can't be far, we'll find them. It's dark, my daughter's only seven! Calm down. Have you looked in the park? We always go there together. If anything's happened to Francesca, I'll kill him! Wait, where are you going? Lucio! Francesca! - Daddy? - Yes, sweetheart, I'm here! Francesca! I'm so sorry. Get up. Renato, get up! Daddy, he can't, his legs hurt. I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Get up! Come here. - What happened? - We got lost. - Why did he bring you here? - I brought him here. Renato couldn't remember the way home. We kept walking around and he needed to pee. - So I brought him here. - Why here? Because it's our place, Daddy. I knew you'd come looking for me here, I knew you'd find me, Daddy. Don't cry, everything's all right now. Daddy's here with you. Don't worry. - You were home and you were drawing? - Yes. Was it Renato's idea to go out? Yes, he wanted an ice cream. It was a secret, though, he can't have sugar. - How was the ice cream? - We didn't get any. The ice cream parlor was closed. We were going home, but we went the wrong way. - And then he got lost. - And he took you to the park? No, I said I wanted to go there. He was tired and... You sat down and he rested his head on your legs? Yes, I stroked his hair because he was crying. Why was he crying, was he ill? No, he was scared. You saw it too, it wasn't normal. All those little kisses, playing horsey... Stop it, Lucio. We didn't want to know because it was too handy and we left Francesca whenever we wanted to. - They never said no. - They love her. Renato is like a grandfather to her. You're okay with this? You're not afraid something happened to her? Why don't you say anything? Because I hope it didn't. Of course. Both your daughter and Mr. Lanciani have been examined, no blood or scratches were found, nor any trace of sperm, so we can rule out sexual abuse. Are you sure nothing happened? They walked holding hands, she gave him a peck on the cheek, but said that wasn't unusual. Yeah, it was a game between them. Right. But then he collapsed and started crying, he must have felt humiliated that they were lost. That's what your daughter told us. Mr. Lanciani became unwell during the interrogation and wasn't able to answer. Mommy? Sweetheart? What's happening? Coming. Daddy? Are you here? Yes, pumpkin, I'm here. I'm sorry. Nothing happened. I was asleep, I didn't notice, I couldn't help it. I know. When was the last time she wet the bed? I don't know. - It's not normal, is it? - No. It's been a tough day. For everyone. Let's not send her to school tomorrow, what do you say? I don't know what's best. Mommy and I are worried about what happened last night, when you got lost. - I'd be happy to talk about it. - Can I skip dance class this afternoon? - Aren't you rehearsing for the recital? - Yeah, but I don't want to go. You want a second breakfast at the cafÃ©? Don't you want a croissant? We're late, the teacher yells at kids who are late. I'll talk to the teacher, I'll walk you to class and say it's my fault. No, don't walk me to class, it's embarrassing. I'd issue a payment order. We need to talk. Yes, we just have to wait till we go to court. Goodbye, we'll speak soon. What is it? - What is it? - At school she doesn't talk to anyone. Something's wrong, have you seen the look in her eyes? What about it? She's completely absent. Something happened in the park and she's not telling us. Nothing happened. When I found them, there was something strange about Renato, I can't explain it. Enough, the police were clear, we mustn't... Francesca's withdrawing into herself, we gotta help her, I don't know how. She can't deal with this on her own. Do you remember if that woman was on the crosswalk? I'm sorry, I don't remember much. I was going to the hospital, it was the night I gave birth. - Is your son all right? - Yes, thanks. Maybe your husband can help me, maybe he remembers whether the streetlights were on... My husband was away for work and he's still not back. He hasn't met the baby yet. All right, then. - Thanks, sorry to bother you. - Can you stay? - Is it too hot? - No, it's fine. Shall I go? There we go. Thank you for staying, I mean it. Her first bath... - It's fine. - Really? Will you hand me...? Thanks. By myself, I'm scared of everything. With you here, now it's different, everything's more real. Not that I expect you to stay all day! It's just that... Never mind. She likes the bath. The girl's behavior can be traced back to a combination of different elements, including that unpleasant business with your neighbor. Did Francesca tell you what happened in the park? My impression is that in the park nothing of a sexual nature happened. "Impression"? There is a chance that an event may be so traumatic that it is deeply repressed. In that case it's difficult to reach it. So, we'll never be certain and we'll never know what happened? I need to know exactly what happened in the park. I was an idiot to leave you alone with Francesca. Tell me the truth, what happened? Answer me. Look at me. Are you pretending not to understand? What did you do to my daughter? I don't know, I don't remember. You don't remember? Tell me the truth or I'll kill you! What did you do to Francesca? Tell me! Tell me the truth! Why were you crying at school the other day? Don't worry about it. - Well? - She's not going to press charges. You could have at least apologized. Sweetheart, let's go. Giovanna should apologize to us. She didn't press charges because Renato isn't innocent. She didn't do it because I begged her not to. She's protecting her husband, who's a pervert. You're sick, you're obsessed by this and nothing can make you change your mind. You need confirmation something awful happened. No, I need confirmation nothing happened to our daughter. First you want us to see a psychologist, we go, and you dismiss what she says, then you attack an old man in hospital, what's wrong with you? Can't you see Francesca's not well? Or you'd rather think that nothing happened so you can go on neglecting her? Get out. Either you get out or I will. Lucio! Charlotte! Hi. - What are you doing here? - Visiting Grandpa. He's not well, he's in hospital. In Paris, Mom and I couldn't understand what happened, Grandma won't talk about it, so we got worried. Of course. How's Francesca? She's fine. I'll see you around, I'm staying for a while. Sure. Thank you. Good night. What happened to you wasn't a coincidence. You've always been a problem for us, you've always disappointed us. You're both judges, you know heaps of people in the courts, isn't there a way to help me? Can't you say that the Breathalyzer results were wrong? No, that's not possible, the results are unequivocal. But you have to help me! The only thing that could help you would be if you showed some remorse. My lawyer says you know the DA very well, ask him to give me a lenient judge, maybe a friend of yours. A friend of ours... A friend of ours... You're a complete moron. You always have been. You could help me, but you don't want to! You killed a woman, you will be tried and you will go to prison. You deserve it. You deserve it! - You deserve it! - Andrea, stop it! Leave him alone! You deserve it! Stop it, Andrea! Oh, God! Dad. Why are you sleeping here? Mommy and I had a fight last night. Because we don't eat healthy enough? Your fights are usually about stupid stuff. You're right. But you always make up in the end, right? Yes. We always make up in the end. Dad? Can I skip school today? Why? At school everybody's acting stupid. - Acting stupid? - They're mean. You have to go to school, or Mommy will be unhappy and so will I. - Then I'll stay inside at recess. - But you'll be on your own. Isn't it fun playing with the others? No, I'd rather stay in the classroom and read. Mom? Mom! What are you doing there? Come on, let's sit down. No, I can't, or else he'll see me, he threatens me. But I won't say anything, I won't tell anyone. I'm here now, calm down. Look who I brought to see you. This is Beatrice. Do you want to hold her? Here. Beatrice. She's good. As soon as she was born, she lay in her cradle without crying. - Don't tell them you've seen me. - No, I won't tell anyone. They think I don't know how to keep a secret, but I do, I'm good. You've become a grandma, are you happy? Well done, you've been very good. Your mother entered the dissociative phase, with persecutory aspects. We've changed her therapy and now we have to see how she responds. It'll happen to me, too. Why do you say that? My mother's illness started after I was born and now, me too, after the birth, I don't feel that great... Pregnancy is a very particular time, but what your mother suffers from isn't hereditary. I get so lonely I want to go and stop someone out on the street, just to talk to an adult. My husband's always away for work, but he'll be home soon. Talk to him, tell him how you feel when he's not here. Yes. A few days ago, there was a bird in the house, dark, black. It was perched on the back of a chair staring at me. It seemed to want something. I know I'm a week late, I had a setback. Look, I've got the proofs here with me. Yes, I'm getting in the car now, the time it takes to get there. On my way, bye. Will you give me a ride? I'm visiting Grandpa, it's a long way. I can't, I've got a work meeting. - Please. - I'm running late. At least to the subway? I already visited him yesterday. It's sad seeing him like this. He looks at me but doesn't speak. If I speak to him, he doesn't answer and looks at Grandma. She keeps quiet, if you ask me they're hiding something. Do you know what happened to Grandpa? No, why do you ask? Grandma said he fell over in front of the house, but then she mentioned a park. I still don't understand what happened that night. Why won't they tell me anything? I'm not a child. I know when I'm being lied to, I can read the signs. Really? The lips, especially. Here. And then the eyes, liars look you straight in the eye, without looking down. Dora? Can you hear me? I'm stuck in here. Will you let me out, please? Dora? Thank you. It's the husband of the woman who... Do you want to go and speak to him? We can go together if you like. It's a chance to apologize. - Good night, sweetheart. - Leave the door open. And the light on in the hall! Hi, Charlotte. - Grandpa was better today. - Ah, really? - Did you find anything out? - I tried, but he didn't answer me. Grandma snapped: leave him alone, you're upsetting him! - Why would he get upset? - Exactly, why? You're an intelligent girl, you can figure it out. - Do you really think I'm intelligent? - Of course. - You going to the hospital tomorrow? - Yes. Keep talking to him and when your grandma goes out, ask him more questions. All right. Bye, Lucio. Good night. No, goddamn it, I fell asleep. I wanted to wait up for you. - Have you seen Beatrice? - Yes, she's beautiful. - Have you held her? - But she's sleeping so peacefully... She has to meet you, come on. - But I'll wake her up. - Of course, pick her up. There, she's woken up. Hi! Hi, darling. What a drag... - I'm going back to Paris tonight. - Tonight? I'm kind of glad, here at my grandparents' place I can't do anything. But in Paris I'm free, I can bring anybody home, my mother's never there. You know, when I have fun, in bed, I mean, I like the guy I'm with, to know it, he deserves it, for effort. It would be embarrassing if my mother heard everything. Are you sorry I'm leaving? Yes, it's a pity, now we'll never find out the truth. Maybe there is a way. How? Every night Grandma writes to Elsa, her best friend who lives in America. She must have told her something. I can read her emails, I set up her account, it's a breeze for me to get in. - Would you really do that? - We can go now. My grandmother won't be home till tonight. I'll put my coat here. Your grandma's compu... What are you doing? - Get dressed, please. - But I thought... No. You don't want me because I'm ugly. You don't like me because I'm flat-chested, right? You think I'm gross, my legs are crooked. What are you talking about? There's nothing wrong with you. You're beautiful. - It's not true. - Yes, it is. How can you say you have crooked legs? Your legs are beautiful. I like what you're doing. You've never done it before, have you? - Why didn't you tell me? - You'd have thought I was a kid. Does it hurt? A little bit. Let's go to the computer, look at the emails. No, there's no point, there are no emails. What? There are no emails and Grandma's friend doesn't exist, I made it all up. I just wanted to be alone with you. For fuck's sake, Charlotte! What were you thinking? Are you mad? No, I'm not mad. Yeah, you're mad. You're a beautiful girl, everyone will fall in love with you. I don't think I'll be able to say goodbye before you leave. I'm sorry. Have a safe trip. She really likes this, it rocks at varying speeds and there's a light and music. Look at her, she's entranced. Monica, I'm sorry, but it really bothers me. I don't want this thing in the house. Come here, darling. We'll buy one ourselves. I've already told you, I don't want anything from my brother. Maybe he just wants to be closer to you. But I don't want to be closer to him. You're overreacting. Did you hear me? I've been ashamed of him all my life, he's only ever caused trouble. My mother was ashamed of him, too. And now he's become the real estate wizard. Maybe he's changed. How can people trust him with their money? He's the last person I'd ever invest with. But a lot of people trust Roberto. I don't give a damn, I want nothing to do with him. But you're brothers... I don't want him to have anything to do with my family. Giorgio, please. Come on! Giorgio! Why do you have to be like this? Don't give gifts to my family, to my daughter or to my wife! Is that clear? Don't touch me! I don't want anything from you, ever again! Giorgio, come here! Hello? Yes, speaking. Yes, he's my son. Of course I know he's under house arrest and can't go out. Who is it? What's happened? - Where is he now? - Is he all right? I see. All right, thanks. He got himself arrested, there was a fight. He was drunk. - Let's go to him. - No. He doesn't want to see us. I'm afraid for him, Vittorio. How will he handle it in jail? I don't know how he'll handle it, I don't know. I'm sorry, Dora, but I'm done. I'm sorry, but I don't want to see him ever again. If you want to maintain relationship with him, you won't have one with me anymore. Lucio! Charlotte! You didn't leave? - Grandpa died last night. - I'm sorry. We brought him home, that's what Grandma wanted. Hug me, hold me tight, I need you! Please, I'm married, you can't come here and act like this! Now you're married? But yesterday when you fucked me you weren't so married! You're an asshole, I'm going to tell everyone! Let's discuss it inside, come. You're an asshole, you don't care about me. How are you doing? Fine. We both overreacted, I'm sorry. It's been a horrible time. Come on, let's get some sleep. I'll be right there. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Thank you, Dora. Giovanna... Aren't you ashamed to show your face here? You insulted my husband, you said awful things about him. - You insulted us. - It's been a difficult period. We're truly sorry about Renato, Lucio lost control... No, he didn't lose control. You want to hurt us, but you shouldn't have touched Charlotte. I won't let you get away with it. FIVE YEARS LATER For the lousy few cents I took from him, Dad made me stand on a stool, grilling me on what I had to say in my defense. He wanted to teach you values. What kind of dad puts an 8-year-old on trial in the living room? But our intentions were good... Who cares about intentions! The result's shit! No matter what I did, you were never satisfied. It was impossible to live up to your expectations: that isn't our way, this is. How was I supposed to find my way? I've waited for this day for five years. You've kept away for five years. Everything time I came to visit, you'd always leave in a huff. - You didn't want me there. - You came behind Dad's back. Do you realize what he forced you to do? I tried to explain it to you... I realized that seeing you is toxic for me. I need to start over, on my own. If I come home, it'll end badly between me and Dad. But why can't you and I...? No, I have to make a clean break or it won't work. "Conspiracy to commit a crime, fraud, embezzlement." Yes, it's in today's paper. It says millions of euros, he's accused of aggravated fraud. Yeah, poor things. They were mainly small savers. "There are suspected ties to the Mafia and money laundering." I can't believe it. What did you tell the cops? Right, we haven't seen him. - Mommy. - Beatrice, I'm talking to Daddy. - Daddy says a big hello. - Say hi from me. She says hi back. They say he's probably fled the country. - What does "widow" mean? - Hold on, Giorgio. A widow is a woman who doesn't have a husband because he's dead. Yeah, here I am. When did he call you? He must be really desperate. No, I'm not defending him! Right, if he calls I won't answer. When are you coming back? That long? Yes, I know. Me, too. Bye. So, you didn't know the girl was underage? No, I didn't know how old she was, she behaved like an adult. You assumed she was of age? - Yes. - And that she gave consent? It's not a situation I sought out, I didn't want things to go that way. But you didn't do anything to stop it. I told her it wasn't appropriate, that she'd misread things, but she started crying. So the girl wasn't lucid, she wasn't in her right mind? No, I didn't say that. She was lucid, but she was crying, she said she felt ugly, rejected. So, what did you do? I tried to comfort her, I stroked her hair. And you took advantage of the moment to kiss her. Why did you kiss her? I thought if she didn't calm down we wouldn't read her grandma's emails and I wouldn't find out what happened in the park that night between Renato, Charlotte's grandfather, and my daughter. And I still haven't. So, an adult man, with an active sex life... mean, didn't you realize the girl was a virgin? When you penetrated her, being a virgin, the girl would have manifested pain, tension... For a moment she froze, she was still, everything happened very slowly. - And it didn't occur to you to stop? - No. Charlotte didn't resist and she didn't ask me to stop. How would you describe the intercourse? Consensual... and a rather clumsy. And here I do a set of pirouettes. Dad, I forgot my Italian textbook at your place. I'll bring it to you at school tomorrow, okay? And this is where the other girls come in. And together we do a pas de chat. - What's happening? - I don't know. Go and see if it's off outside. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. No, not at all. I'm worried about tomorrow, I know it'll go badly. No. Let's hope it doesn't. Do you want to sleep over tonight? Don't worry, I'll go home. Thank you. Good girl, you found a candle. The whole building is out, the stairs, too. Let's eat, come on. All right. The dog searched the whole city for the little girl: little girl, where are you? Little girl, where are you? The little bird flew high up in the sky and from up there, he spotted her. Mommy, will you do a moose? Oh, gosh, I don't know how to do a moose. Enough now, let's go to bed. Can I sleep with you? All right, come on. Did you know Camilla's parents call you "the widow"? - That so? - Yeah, she told me that. Can I wait up for Daddy's call? - No, he calls too late. - Not fair! Good night. Good night, darling. Who's there? Is somebody there? - Roberto? - Hi, Monica. - Giorgio's not here. - I know, or else I wouldn't have come. I need somewhere to hide, if they find me they'll kill me. You need to leave or I'll call the cops. All I need is a little time, I'll give all the money back to everyone. Let me sleep for a few hours, I'll leave in the morning. It's too dangerous, my daughter's sleeping in there. Beatrice? Yes. Just for tonight. What do you do at school? We learn. Learn what? How to write a bit, how to read a bit. - Can you read already? - Nearly. It's ten o'clock... I was leaving, but Beatrice woke up and I stayed with her. Did you know he's Daddy's brother? Yes, but why didn't you wake me? I thought you could take the day off. But he and Daddy had a big fight. That's right, and that's why the two of us have never met. - Are you going to make up? - Of course. But when you see Daddy, don't tell him you met me, it has to be a secret between you and me. All right. Mommy, can Uncle stay and eat with us today? "In the name of the Italian people," "the Court of Rome in the hearing of April 8, 2015," "hands down the following verdict." "Pursuant to article 530 of the Code of Criminal Procedure," "the defendant Lucio Polara is acquitted of the charge against him," "as there is no case to answer". Dora! What's wrong? I don't want to live without him. What am I going to do? I miss him. Let him go, he's made us suffer so much. Enough. Enough. Now I have to go on a very long trip, but when I see you again, you'll be grown up. How old will I be? I don't know, you'll be a beautiful girl, maybe I won't even recognize you. Now go to sleep. Can you stay until I fall asleep? All right. - Good night, darling. - Good night, Mommy. What an asshole! He said you were his soul mate and he leaves you all alone. I'm used to it by now, although, when it's just me and her for a while, without speaking to anyone, I start to feel weird and I scare myself. Once, he said: if you go anywhere near Monica, I'll kill you. - What? - Yeah, you'd just gotten together. One night, at the beach house, I walked past your room and you were in there alone, asleep. You were naked, you had the sheet between your legs. One leg was uncovered, the other wasn't, you were so... Has Giorgio ever told you why we fell out? No, he won't talk about it. I entered the room, walked over to you, and I kept looking at you. Then someone grabbed me from behind, it was Giorgio, he dragged me away, he threatened me. He was beside himself. I didn't know that. Go in there! Stay in there. - Who is it? - Is Giorgio here? - No, he's away. - You're Monica, right? I'm Saverio Brasini. Saverio, what is it? What do I do now? I've lost everything! I gave everything to Roberto, I trusted him. I watched him and Giorgio grow up, I worked with their father for thirty years! Roberto said it was a bargain, he took my severance pay and all our savings! - I'm sorry. - Call Giorgio, I want to talk to him! It's late at night there, he'll be asleep. I don't care, I need to tell him what his brother's done! If Roberto won't give me my money back, he has to! My wife and I will end up on the street, don't you get it? Mommy! Go back to sleep, it's nothing. Where would you like me to touch you? On my neck. - With my fingertips or lips? - With your lips. Then I'll run them down your back, your hips... your skin's soft. - Are we at your place? - Not yet, we're at CaffÃ¨ Valentini. No, I don't like the decor there. - Where, then? - At Antognioli. They do this amazing ice cream: almond and mandarin. Then we go to my place and as I close the door I start to kiss you. You lick my earlobe, you slip your tongue in. - All at once? - Yes, deep inside. Then I lick you, slowly, all over. And then? Mommy. Wake up, you have to take me to school. Oh, my God! - What time is it? - I don't know. - See? The light's back on. - Yes... - I'll make breakfast. - No, it's late, hurry up. Come on, quick. - Hurry! - Coming. Okay, let's go. Wait a moment, sweetheart. I'll be right there. I thought you'd left. No, not yet. I'll wait for you here, I'll go when you get back. - Is that okay? - Yes. See you then. See you then. Daddy's here! What? Hello, darling! I couldn't wait till after school. Look what I got you! Do you like it? Are you happy? - I'm happy you're home. - Me too. What about you, is this a nice surprise? How are you? Daddy, while you were away something crazy happened. Right, Mommy? There was a blackout, it was all dark. - All dark? - Go in now, it's late. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye, sweetheart. It was harder this time, huh? I can tell, I'm sorry, forgive me. - Roberto came to our place. - What? I hid him for two nights. - But didn't he skip the country? - He's at our place. You let him in? - Are you going to turn him in? - You bet I am! That asshole had the nerve to come to our home! Where is he? - Has he gone? - I don't know. He was here before, drinking coffee. Monica, there's no one here. He's run away, typical. He was here, he said he'd wait for me. Maybe he had to leave, he tidied up and... Wait, honey. Tell me what happened, calmly. He came at night, he was frightened, and he slept here. - Did Beatrice see him? - Yes, of course. She was pleased to meet him. She didn't say anything before. Maybe she was afraid you'd be mad. - Roberto told her you fought. - What did he do? You never told me you fought about me. - What...? - You threatened him. You said you'd kill him if he didn't stay away from me. He told me everything about that night. Don't you remember? I told you about it. You've always known. I don't know, Giorgio. I'm scared. I'm scared. Sara? What's wrong? Are you okay? Charlotte... They've decided to appeal. I can't take it anymore. Excuse me. - What do you want? - To speak with Charlotte. Has she left already? Hi. The past five shitty years haven't been enough for you? You starting up again? What do you want to prove? What's going on? You let your mother and grandmother decide for you. But you're an adult now! Why won't you tell the truth? Don't listen to him. Tell them you wanted to, that it wasn't just me! Charlotte doesn't have to tell us a thing, we know what happened. In all these years you've never apologized, not to me, but at least to her, she was just a kid. That's enough now, go away. Here it is! I want to see... Do you think this answering machine still works? Let's see. - Where does this go? - Here. There, that's it. - Then? - It turns on here. Let's see. Hi, this is Andrea's, Dora's and Vittorio's house. We're not here, leave a message and we'll back call... we'll call back you... we'll call you back! Hello, you've reached the answering machine of Dora Simoncini and Vittorio Bardi. We're not home right now, leave a message and we'll call you back. Thank you. FIVE YEARS LATER Andrea's mom is here. Good evening, Dora. Hi, Matteo. Hi, Tommaso. I'm sorry about your husband. Thank you. Sorry, but every so often I have to ask you about him. Unfortunately we haven't heard from Andrea. I need to see him, I don't know if he's heard about his father. I don't know, he's disappeared, we've no idea where he is. If we hear anything, we'll let you know. Good, thank you. - Good night. - Goodbye. Great, one more contraction and he'll be born. Relax between one contraction and the next. You're doing so well. - Will I manage with two kids? - Of course. I don't know if I will. I'm here, I'm with you. I won't go away anymore, I'll stay with you. Here it is... You're doing great. C'mon, harder. Another push and we're there. Here he is! Hello. When are you leaving? When I'm done here. I'm going to live with my boyfriend in Paris, I wanted to have a few of Grandma's things. A few things... I'm taking it all. - Francesca. - Hey, Dad. - Hi, Charlotte. - Hi, Lucio. I'm taking some of my grandparents' things. Shall we go? Sorry, but we have things to do. I have to get organized, I'm going to school in Spain for a year. Cool! Are you excited to go? I sure am, but he's sad. Let's go. Bye. Hello, you've reached the answering machine of Dora Simoncini and Vittorio Bardi. We're not home right now, leave a message and we'll call you back. Thank you. Vittorio, it's Dora. I need to talk to you. I know this is dumb, but I don't want to visit you at the cemetery. I can't talk to a headstone, nor do I want to pretend that you're up there listening to me. I don't believe in it, I'll never believe in it. That's not our way. But I need to tell you everything, like I did for thirty years. Andrea didn't come to your funeral. We got it all wrong. All these years without him have been horrible. You can't force a woman to choose between her husband and her son. And I made my choice, because I thought I couldn't live without you, and that I could without him. I know it's not nice... Goddamn... I don't believe it! Mom, did you hear that? Yes. I'll go see what it was. Yes. Everything okay, Daddy? Hand me that stuff, please. - The big ones first? - Yeah. No, not that one... Thanks. - When will you be back? - Soon, next week. - Why's your brother crying? - I don't know. Where are you going? What's the matter with Lorenzo? Monica? - Morning, I've brought some clothes. - Go over there. Luigi, help this lady. Over here. Badu, let's make room and help the lady. Thank you. - What do we have here? - Shoes. Thank you, we need shoes. Hey were my husband's. Here, there are shirts, jackets, practically all identical. My husband only liked certain things, he dressed the same way all his life. Get outta here! Are you leaving the suitcases, too? Yeah, sure. - Vittorio Bardi was your husband? - Yes. - The judge? - Yes, did you know him? No, not personally. Go away! What do you want? Leave us alone! Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am? May I? I'll put these here for you, they belonged to Luigi's wife. Your clothes are too dirty. Do you feel better? - Yes, thank you. - See you later. Hello there. Will you eat with us? Here, as you can see... We all live together, let's say Luigi has adopted us. Who knows what he's has to make up for! Yeah, who knows what I got up to in a previous life! So, will you stay? Nobody likes to eat on their own. No, thank you, you're very kind, but I have to get home. Goodbye, thank you. Is someone waiting for you at home? All right, goodbye. It was a strange way to meet, even though sooner or later we would have met anyway. I'll get the clothes to you soon, but now I have to go. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, thank you. The bathtub was pointless to you, worse, it was something decadent, wasteful. You said: what do you need to wash with, except water? And yet, taking a nice hot bath is an utter pleasure. And we deprived ourselves for so long. Why does this place suddenly seem so sad to me? We lived here for thirty years and I never noticed. After today, I felt like knocking on everyone's door and saying: hey, wake up, the world's a little bigger than this building, it's... There you are, darling. I got toothpaste and shampoo, the one Mommy uses, for when she returns. And her orange marmalade, she only eats that one. Yes? Hello? - Monica, is that you? - Let me talk to her! - Are you okay? Where are you? - I don't know. I'm a bit tired, but I'm all right. Tell me where you are, I'll come get you. What are the kids doing? They're here with me. Stay where you are, okay? Yes, we walked a long way, but now we've stopped. - But we're leaving now. - Is someone there with you? - Let me speak to someone! - My mother's here. Your mother's in the clinic. Tell me where you are, I'll come get you and bring you home. No, I can't, I promised her, we're taking a trip together, just me and her. Is there anybody near you? Tell them you have to come home. Let me talk to her! Hello? I wanted to talk to her and you didn't let me. Why did you tell me she went to Milan? You treat me like an idiot! I'm sorry, forgive me. What did she say? - When's she coming home? - I don't know! She's a little confused right now, she imagines things... But she'll get better and come back to us, right? Yes. How is it? Good, it's the right size, too. It's got pockets. It's just that I've always worn clothes like this, maybe I ought to try something colorful... Do you like this one? - It should be the right size. - Yes, it's pretty. My husband used to slip into the cubicle with me, to help me decide. I miss him a lot. - These? - They're light, comfortable in summer. Beautiful. I wonder what my husband would say about this one. Definitely that it's too expensive. It is beautiful, though. This way. - How many square meters is it? - 110, 115... Here's the kitchen. With a small balcony, a storage closet, very handy. This is the living room. - There's a lot of light. - There is. And this is the terrace. - How wonderful! - Look at the view! Are you leaving the plants? Yes, I think so. Is it all compliant, no illegal renovations? - Can I ask you...? - Good morning. What are you doing here? Sorry, the door was open... Dora, do you have a minute? - No, I'm busy with this couple. - One minute only. - Do you mind? - Go ahead. I'll be right back. - I've decided to sell the house. - I need a favor. I want you to come somewhere with me. Why? Where? We can take my car, we'll be back tonight. Why do I have to come? I don't even know you. Trust me, it's something that concerns you too. Excuse me? I'll be right there. - I have to go. - Think about it, but it's urgent. Now that we've sold Grandma's house, I won't come to Rome much. I don't understand why you're here. After the trial I tried to contact you many times, you never replied to my messages. What did we have to say? I wanted you to know that it was me who decided not to go ahead with appeal. My mother and my grandmother didn't agree, at all. I wanted to tell you that I wasn't angry with you, I hope you're still not angry with me. It was a long time ago... I was in love with you, I always had been, since I was a kid. I couldn't wait for vacations to come to Rome and see you. I was obsessed with you. I'm so sorry, forgive me for everything that happened, it shouldn't have, it was my fault. - Did you ever tell your daughter? - No. Better that way. Have you ever heard of illegal tango? Or clandestine mazurkas and milongas? People meet up at a secret location and start dancing. In a few days, the streets of Rome will be invaded by dancers. But what do we like more, dancing or doing it secretly? What do you do secretly? Tell us, leave a message on 335... Do you like dancing? No, not really. You're not taking me dancing, are you? No, relax, I'm not. Are we sure? All right, thank you. Goodbye. We're nearly there. My daughter Agnese lives near here. - Are we going to see her? - Yes. She likes living in the country, away from everything, she's always been a loner. But now it's different. I'm worried about Agnese. She recently had a baby, she wanted to give birth at home. Now she's tired, confused. She's having trouble breastfeeding, coping with the baby. I really don't know how to help her. Next, we'll hear from a listener calling in from a roadside diner: Dora. Hi, I'm Dora. I feel kind of stupid... I did lots of things behind my husband's back, things he couldn't stand, like smoking, making up silly words with my son when he was little and listening to this show. You don't say! It's the first time I've had a secret listener. Thank you, Dora. And the rest of you, keep calling! Agnese lives with your son, he's the baby's father. Andrea has a son? Did he ask you to bring me here? No, it was my idea, he doesn't know you're here. They need help, they're ill-prepared. I haven't seen him in five years. I know. That's why I didn't tell you, I didn't want you to say no. What do you want to do? Let's go. There's my daughter. Hi, I brought you some things. Dora, I'm so happy you came. This is Ludovico. You want to? Take him. He doesn't sleep at night, I think he has colic, and we don't sleep either. He's beautiful. I know it's not easy for you. Andrea's working at the beehives, down there. Andrea. Stop, don't come any closer. - Why did you come? - I met your son. - Maybe you don't know, your father... - Yeah, I know. I tried to find you when he got sick, I wanted you to know, but no one knew where you were. I've missed you. It's been terrible for me not seeing you. Perhaps now we can talk. What do you want to talk about? You decide everything, as usual. You always decided everything, you and Dad. Now that I've built a new life for myself, you show up and change things, I'm not good with that. That was a disaster. I'm sorry, I didn't think it would go like that. Don't be sorry, it's not your fault. Unfortunately, Andrea... Yeah, it was a disaster. You were right, Vittorio, maybe it was better not to see him again. At least I could still hope things might change, but now I'm certain Andrea will never change. Unfortunately nothing will ever change between him and me. Hello, Dad? Dad? Francesca? What are you doing here? I haven't been in this house for ages. I wanted to see it before I left. I wonder what it'll be like when I come back, who'll be living here. Everything will be different. - Are you worried about the trip? - Yeah, a bit. Now that my departure's looming... I don't know anyone, and Spanish... You don't have to go, if you don't want to, we can call it off. But I want to go, I'm just a bit scared. I liked being with Renato and Giovanna, they were like grandparents. I had fun with Renato, he used to tell weird stories. He was funny, but I don't think he was very well. The last time I saw him was that night we got lost. Do you remember what happened that night? Yeah, of course, I remember everything. - Everything? - That we got lost in the park. And? And nothing, we stayed there and waited for you. Why all the questions? Because I was afraid, and I still am. Of what? I was afraid that Renato... That Renato...? No way! Seriously! Come on! - Nothing happened? - No, Dad. Nothing happened. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Good morning, I'm Andrea Bardi's mother. Come in. Thank you. I've realized my son will never do it, so, even though it was so many years ago, I wanted to apologize. I'm sorry about what happened and how my son behaved. For years I deluded myself he was different... Excuse me a moment. This is from Andrea. For a few months now, he's been writing and sending me his honey. He's asked if he can see me, he wants to talk to me, to meet me. But I still don't feel up to it. I'm sorry, but I can't. I can't help him. Go. Perfect. - Are you done? - Nearly. - Four kilos over. - No! I have to do it all again! And the carry-on bags! Where can I put all this stuff? I forgot my bathroom stuff. I don't believe it! She's been like this for two days, I can't wait for her to leave. That's not true. You're right. Vittorio, this is the last message I'll leave you. After so many years, tomorrow I'll wake up in a bed that's not ours. You'd probably say I'm rushing things, that it's not our way. But from now on, it's not about our way, from now on, it's my way. - I'm going down, Dad. - Wait, we'll go together. I'll wait for you downstairs. Hi, Beatrice. Dad's leaving for work and we're going to Grandma's in Turin. - Can I ask you a favor? - Sure. If Mom comes back, can you give her the keys? Will you tell her we're at Grandma's and we'll be away for a week? Don't worry, I'll let your mom know. What's that? What's Lorenzo doing? He's all quiet. - You need your backpack? - No. - Boarding pass? - Yes. Here we are. Have fun. Bye, sweetheart. Be good. Call me when you get there. THREE FLOORS
