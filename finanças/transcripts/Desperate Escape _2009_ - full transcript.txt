Oh, my God! Over here, over here! There's somebody in the water. There's somebody in the water. Serious head trauma. Get me the CAT-scan results. Has her breathing stabilized? Check her vitals. Checking pulse. We may need some more sutures on that laceration. Lots of blood loss here. Get me the CAT-scan results. Pupils are dilated. Pupils are reacting, Marilyn, get me the blood pressure. Marilyn, get me the CAT-scan results. Lots of blood loss here. Pupils are dilated. What happened to her? Serious head trauma. Marilyn, get me the blood pressure. Fishermen pulled her out of the ocean. Boating accident? Any change in her condition? Umm... Stabilized, but no change. Anyone come to ID her yet? Not yet. We still don't know who she is. Yeah, I'm looking for my fiancée. Her name is Brooke Harris. I'm Dr. Kaplan, can I help you? Yes. He's looking for his fiancée. Her name was Brooke Harris. She was on a boat late last night, and I think she might have fallen overboard. And who are you? My name is Michael Coleman, I'm her fiancé. Now, I've been to three hospitals already and your receptionist said that you had a Jane Doe here. Is that her? Yes. We were beginning to think nobody would come, there was no identification, nothing on the news. Where is she? Can I see her? Of course. Please, have a seat. Get me her file. Yes, Doctor. Is she okay? I mean, tell me she's all right. Mr. Coleman, I know it's been a long night. Doctor, please, just tell me she's all right. Your fiancée has suffered from some severe trauma. We need to run a couple more tests before you can see her. Okay. I promise, as soon as I run those tests, I'll take you to her, okay? I'll be right back. Fluids are low, increase the drip. Blood pressure has stabilized. Lacerations around the scalp. Her legs seem to look good. Should heal nicely with minimal scarring, if any. Pupils are reactive. Marilyn, did you get the CAT-scan results yet? Yeah. The swelling has gone down considerably. I don't think we're looking at any permanent damage. Do you see these? You can tell by the purplish colors that these are more recent, the ones from last night. The others, the greenish ones... What do you see? These bruises were sustained before the boating accident? File a report with the police just to be on the safe side. Mr. Coleman. Doctor, how is she? Can I see her now? Oh. That's everything she had on her when she was found. That's funny, I don't remember seeing that before. Wouldn't leave the house without it. Brooke, baby, can you hear me? It's me, it's Michael. I'm here now, baby, everything's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take you home. I need a moment with you. Your fiancée suffered a heavy blunt-force trauma to the head in the accident. She's in a coma. What? She has a severe concussion. Her brain is swollen, putting pressure on the spine. The good news is that the inflammation is going down, so I don't perceive... Umm... Is there anything that can be done? The only thing we can do right now is wait. There's no telling how long it may last. It could be a day, a week. There's really no guarantees. She's in the best care here. We'll be watching her round the clock. But there's something else. We found bruises on her that appeared to have occurred before the accident. From what? I was hoping maybe you could tell me. Brooke's a pretty athletic girl. She... she plays tennis, goes hiking. I suppose it could be from any one of those. You should be aware that it's hospital policy to report any suspicious injuries. What? What are you saying? Not that I'm accusing anyone of anything. What, no, you think that I hit her? That I abuse her? No. I'm not saying that at all. I'm just saying I have to fill out the report. I understand. Look, I need you to be strong for her right now, okay? She's awake! Somebody, she's awake! She's in shock, she doesn't know where she is. Can you hear me? Can you understand? Can you hear me? Give me a sign that you can hear me. You're at County Hospital. You were brought here for treatment. I'm Dr. Kaplan. Michael's here. He's been by your side the entire time. I'm right here, sweetheart. Do you know what happened to you? Everything will be fine. You're safe here. Okay, shh... Tell me if you can understand, okay? You had a serious accident. You were in a coma for almost two days. You're lucky to be alive. Do you remember your name? Brooke. That's good. Do you remember the accident? Anything about how you got here? Everything's gonna be fine. You rest now. We'll continue later. What's going on? Why is she like this? I know this is very difficult for you. The concussion has caused swelling of the lobes, which puts pressure on the spine. The brain is bruised. The injuries she sustained caused damage to the area responsible for her memory. Like amnesia? What, is it permanent? Most cases, the memory does come back, it just takes some time. How much time? It varies on the patient. It depends on the extent of the damage. What can be done? Just be patient with her. It's gonna take some getting used to, but she will get better. Just be there for her. If she's struggling, help her. People, places. She's gonna rely on you to help cope with her memory. Okay, when can I take her home? A couple of days. I need to run a few more tests first. Okay. Now she needs her rest. Okay, it's important she isn't subjected to anything too stressful... physically, emotionally. She's had enough excitement for today. Okay, I understand. Please don't worry if you can't remember anything. Bits and pieces will come back and then, I promise, everything will fall into place eventually. I was so worried when I found you here like this. I mean, if something happened to you... ...I really don't know what I'd do. You don't remember me at all, do you? I know how hard this is for you. I'm sorry. No. Don't you be. The most important thing is that you're all right. And I promise you, I'm gonna help you and we're gonna get through this, okay? They're gonna let us get out of here in a couple days, and... I wanna take you to our vacation house. It's... it's quiet and it's peaceful, no one to bother us. You can rest there. And then when you're feeling better, we'll go to our place in the city. Okay? How's that sound? Sounds nice. Sedatives. I want you to rest. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Thank you for everything, Doctor. Ready to go? Yeah. It's so beautiful. How could I forget this view? You're right about that. It is beautiful. And that's a great start. I'm gonna get a coffee, you want anything? I'll be right back. Honey! I, um, was just looking for you because I, uh, missed you. Well, we're gonna be there soon. We should probably get going, okay? Let's go. ...on the lower deck. So is it just us? Yeah. So no family, I don't have anybody else? Uh... Well, there's Courtney, your sister. She lives down in Kent. Oh, well, maybe we should call her. She might be worried. No, I called her when you were in the hospital. What did she say? You two haven't spoken in a while. Really? Don't worry. We've got each other. Listen, before we head home, we should probably pick a few things up at the market. What is it, what's wrong? I don't know if this is such a good idea. Maybe I should go sit in the car. If it's about the little girl, she's just being a kid. Okay? Okay. I... I really, I really don't feel comfortable in here. Sweetheart, okay, we'll just grab a couple things, we'll be off in a second, okay? Okay, can you make it fast? You got it. Now, I'm just gonna go grab something. Are you okay to stand here while I do that? I'll be back before you miss me. Hurry. Okay. You're gonna be okay, I promise. Oh, my God! There you are! You have no idea how worried I've been about you. I'm sorry, do I... I don't know. You don't... It's me, Melissa. Mel? Melissa. I heard about what happened to you. Are... are you okay? I'm sorry, I don't remember you. Oh, sweetheart. Where did you go? I was looking for you. Hi, Melissa. What happened to her? We're not sure, exactly. She went out on the boat and somehow fell overboard. I always warn her about the boat. Thank goodness you're alive. It's okay, honey, this is Melissa. You guys are best friends. You really don't remember me, do you? I'm sorry, I'm sure it'll come back to me. Can we go now? Yeah. Are you guys gonna be in town for a while? Yeah, we're just gonna go up to the cabin and hang out until things get back to normal. Is there anything I can do? No, we just need some healing time. Okay. Take care of yourself, okay? Anything familiar? Mmm, I don't know, sort of. It's like I've seen it all before, but I don't know where or when. That's a pretty good sign. Sounds like there's a few things rattling around in there trying to get out. I was thinking it might be a good idea for you to spend some time with Melissa, maybe bring back some memories. Welcome home. This is our vacation house? You decorated it. How do we afford this place? Oh, it was practically a steal. A lot of blood, sweat and tears went into this place, but... yeah, I do all right. Do I work? Yeah, tech support. You work from home, helping your clients by remote. I hope that memory comes back. I'm just gonna grab the groceries and the bag out of the car. Yeah, I'd like to roam around a little bit by myself. That's a good idea. Holler if you need anything, okay? Hi. I was thinking, it's a beautiful day outside. Might be a good idea to go for a walk. How you doing? I feel great. I kinda thought this would make you feel better. It's beautiful, I wanna take in every little detail. Really? I was kinda hoping we could pick up the pace for the last mile. Yeah, go ahead. Really? No problem, I'll meet you at home. Okay, well, just... You follow the path until it gets you to the base, okay? You sure? Yeah, go ahead. Michael? Michael! Michael! Hello? Hello? Are you okay? I heard shouting. I... I got lost. I... didn't know where I was. Honey! I told you to follow the trail. It would have taken you straight back to the base. Oh, sweetheart, sweetheart, I'm so sorry. I never should have left you. Can we go home now? Of course. Need any help? Drink and chop. Could you wash these for me? Thank you. That was delicious. I'm glad to see your taste buds haven't changed. You know, I... made that the very first time I cooked for you. That is your favorite. Well, you certainly are a good cook. And you said that the first time I cooked for you, too. Really, tell me about it. Oh, God. Um... Well, it was Valentine's Day and we were supposed to go out for dinner, but some jackass forgot to make reservations. Ouch! Yeah, well, I can't be expected to remember everything. I had candy and I had the flowers, so... What were they? Orchids. You love orchids. And I also got you a little bear. Oh, you got me a bear? So I just went to the pantry and got out what I had and... there it was. Very nice. What's wrong? I just need a little time. Take all the time you need. Brooke? Brooke, you okay? Look out, look out, look out, look out! I'm sorry. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I was trying to make you breakfast. Pancakes? That's all I could remember. Sweetheart, it's all right, it's all right. Was there somebody at the door? I didn't get there in time. I'm so sorry. Honey, honey, it's okay. Okay, how about I take you out for breakfast, okay? Okay. Okay, why don't you get dressed and I'll be right up. I was looking at the pictures in the hallway. Oh. Yeah, you were rearranging them before the accident. I don't know where you put them, so I just left it. I'm sorry, I just feel alone. I understand. I'm sorry about Courtney. Why aren't we talking? I don't really know. You two just haven't gotten along since your parents died. I was hoping that maybe when things calmed down a bit, you could invite her up to the house. Do you think she'd come? I don't know, but we can try. I think that car is following us. What? The car behind us, they were following us last night. Sweetheart, there's nobody following us. Who is it? Maybe if I just make a turn up here. I'm Detective Wagner. This is Detective Hanson. We're with the PD. Okay, how can I help you? Yeah, can we see some identification? Sure. Why didn't you pull over? Well, that's 'cause I didn't know you guys were police officers. Sure. Step out of the car. It's okay. That way. Listen, my fiancée just had an accident. We're a little on edge here. I see a strange car following us, and I don't know what to think. Uh-huh. You mind telling me what this is all about? Where were you the night your fiancée disappeared, Mr. Coleman? Home. And I was waiting for her to come home. Did you speak with anybody during that time? Anybody that can corroborate that you were there? No, I didn't. Are you implying that I had something to do with that? Any phone calls? No, I didn't speak with anybody. You have any idea why she would have been on that boat? Well, we use it a lot. She likes to go out on it sometimes and clear her head. It's peaceful. In the middle of the night? Well, maybe the storm came up after she left. I really don't know. Listen, you're welcome to speak with her, but I'm not sure how much she's gonna be able to tell you... We heard. We already spoke with Dr. Kaplan at County. Okay, well, then you guys know as much as everyone. One more thing, Mr. Coleman. Dr. Kaplan mentioned something about some bruises. Okay, I will tell you exactly what I told her. Tennis. Brooke is outdoors a lot. Have you ever hit your fiancée, Mr. Coleman? No, I haven't. And I wouldn't do anything to hurt her. Well, please call us if you have any... useful information, anything at all. I got it. Number's on the card. All right, thank you. What did they want? They were just following up on the accident. Procedure. It's nothing. What were we sitting here for? Hello, Brooke. I hear we had a little accident. Do you remember me at all? You look familiar. Well, that's a good start. I'm Dr. Richard Alvarez. I'm an old friend of Michael's. The best thing about amnesia is you're always meeting new friends. Well, I'm glad you haven't lost your sense of humor. Now, I don't want you to feel embarrassed or ashamed of your condition. We're all here to get you through this. Get you back to where you belong. Now, Michael tells me you've been experiencing nightmares. Want to tell me about those? There are little flashes of memories. They don't make much sense. Just kind of random, really. Oh, believe me, they're anything but. What I think is going on here is your brain is trying to piece together a puzzle to help you understand what happened that night. And that's exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna help you take details out of these flashes, help you put the pieces together so you can get back to normal and you two can get on with your lives. Thank you. So, Brooke, can you tell me about these flashes? I'm running. Scared, I... Being chased by somebody. Who? I don't know. Somebody... I can't really see who it is. There's nobody... there to help me. Whenever I get to a safe place, he's there and he stops me. It's like he's... ...always there, waiting for me. He hits me and... ...there's a girl. She's running through the woods and... she's scared and, uh... she's... she's hiding from somebody. I... I don't know. I don't know. I know this is hard for you. The mind works in strange ways. Some memories rise to the surface while others just dissipate. These childhood memories, it's... it's your subconscious trying to tell you something. Next time you have one of these visions, try not to focus on what it is, but try to understand what it's about. Look for small details. What's in the background? What people are wearing, a hat, a handbag, things like that. The place you're in. It's these small details that are the key to you remembering who you are, the people around you and what happened that night. Any one thing can bring on a flood of memories. That make any sense to you? Thank you, Doctor. Call me Richard. Well, thank you, Richard. Any time. That wasn't so bad, was it? Maybe he's right. Maybe I'm looking at things in the wrong way. Listen, I'm gonna have to drop you off at home. I'm late, I've gotta meet a client. Oh. Someone's gotta pay the mortgage. What is it you do again? Marketing. And if I can get this bid, we're gonna be set for a while. Okay. You know, maybe I should go back to work, too. That's not a bad idea. If I could remember enough. I really don't wanna leave you. That's okay. I'll... I'll visit Melissa. I should have her number. That's not a bad idea. I won't be long. I love you. How's the recovery? Taking it moment to moment. So you don't remember anything? Little things, like... I see something and I know it's supposed to mean something to me, but it just doesn't. Like my sister. Michael says we don't get along, but I have no idea why. You're... you're really lucky to have someone like him. Yeah, he's really great. He, um... But, you know, I don't even remember how we met. It's like living with a complete stranger. The video store. What? That's how you guys met, the video store. You guys were fighting over the last copy of some DVD, and he suggested that you guys watch it together. You're kidding. No, no. Love works in mysterious ways. You okay? Brooke? Are you okay? Come on, let's go. Where are we going? Brooke, what are you doing? I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm sorry. Mind your own business. Brooke! Who was that guy? I don't know. He gives me the creeps. Then let's just go. Is that the boat? Yeah, it is. I heard they towed it in this morning. You're lucky it didn't hit the banks. What is it? It's nothing. I just hope you won't go out alone again. You know you can always call me. What was I doing here that night? Clearing your head? I don't think I was alone. What are you talking about? There was somebody here with me that night. Who? Who else was here? Who else was there? I don't know. Brooke! Brooke, I can't help you unless you tell me. I just need to get a hold of myself. I can't work. I can't work. tta get a hold of myself. I've gotta... calm down. If just... I gotta just relax. Where would I have put them? God, sweetheart! I'm so sorry, I wasn't... I wasn't thinking. Oh, baby, oh, I'm sorry I scared you. It's okay. It's okay. How was your day with Melissa? It was good, we had a nice chat. That's good. We took a walk in town. We saw the boat. Good. Spark any memories? Anything come back to you? Not really. I tried to do some work, but I guess I'm not really ready to go back yet. Well, we'll work on that. There was one thing. While I walked past the store, something about a bag. A bag? What kind of bag? It was a suitcase. Hmm, I wonder what that means. Do you wanna talk to Richard about it? Remember what he said about the small details? It could be important. I don't think Richard's interested in my subconscious telling me I need to go on a shopping spree. No, no, remember what Dr. Alvarez said. The answers are in the details. You focus on an object, even if it seems insignificant. You start there and you work your way backwards. It's just a suitcase. No, no, that must be your mind trying to tell you something. Come on, just tell me about the suitcase. I'd rather not do this now. Brooke, this could be important. Come on. Tell me about the suitcase. Close your eyes. What color is it? It's brown. It has... big... buckles. They're large. Gold. What's inside? Clothes. It's dark, it's hard to see. What else is inside? I don't know. It's... It's... I can't see... Concentrate. I don't remember anymore. It's okay. I thought we were having a breakthrough there, I just didn't want to lose momentum. Maybe later. Okay. I was thinking that maybe later we could get a bottle of wine and sit by the fire. We could talk more about this if you want to. I don't really wanna do that tonight. It's been a long day. I'm just gonna go upstairs and curl up in bed. I'm sorry, I just need a little time. Take all the time you need. I had another weird dream last night. Really? What was it about? I don't know, but I'd really like to talk to Dr. Alvarez about it. Um... yeah, I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you. I spoke with Richard yesterday. He's going out of town for a few days. Oh. More work? Yeah, I gotta go back into town. This client is really busting my hump. Can I come with you? I could really use some fresh air. Sure. Well, something tells me you haven't forgotten how to use a credit card. I'll be back to pick you up in about an hour. Okay. Anything she remembers. She could remember everything. She remembered the bag. Look, I'm gonna be out of town for a few days. Just be careful. I'm doing everything I can. Look, I need to show you something. Come out to the car. No, it's late. It's gonna take a second. You hear something? Hmm? Come on. What was it? Nothing, I guess. I gotta go anyway, I got an appointment. I'll talk to you later. Detective Wagner. Hi, it's Brooke Harris. How can I help you, Ms. Harris? I think something's going on. I was wondering if I could see you? Where are you? I'm outside a store, it's called Highland Books. Okay. Meet me down by the docks in ten minutes. Okay, thanks. How's your head? Well, the pain is gone, but my memory is still a little hazy. So what's going on? Why were you following us yesterday? Why do you wanna know? Just tell me. We're just trying to solve the case. Is my fiancé a suspect? Michael is a person of interest, but... But what? How much do you remember about your relationship with him? Not much. Why? Do you think he did it? He doesn't have a solid alibi, and it wouldn't be the first time. And there is something else. We asked around about your engagement, and no one seems to remember anything. What the... Our house, the ring. Dr. Kaplan said she didn't see a ring in all your possessions. That's crazy, I mean, what about Dr. Alvarez? What about... what about him? Who? He... Richard Alvarez, my psychiatrist. He knows about it. We'll look into it, okay? I know how hard it is. Now, you mentioned something was going on. Did you see anything or hear anything? What's going on, Ms. Harris? It's nothing. Ms. Harris. I think that Michael is keeping some things from me. Some things? Missing pictures, stuff like that. I need you to think back before the accident. Is there anything you can think of? Like what? Abuse. No, what are you talking about? Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you, Ms. Harris. Unless you say otherwise, this is probably gonna end up being filed under "accident." There are no witnesses, you're not dead, and nothing's been stolen, as far as we know. So the only person who knows what happened on that boat is you. Michael. Michael! You forgot this. Oh. Melissa, thank you. Sorry! Sorry! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Brooke, are you okay? Get in the car, I'll take you home. You wanna talk about it? Not really. Look at you, you're shaking. Okay, okay, I'I'sorry. Brooke... I know you don't remember everything that happened and that you're going through a rough time right now, but... we're best friends and we tell each other everything. I just wanted to get back to that. Is there something you'd like to tell me? About what? What's going on with you and Michael? Are you serious? There's nothing going on between Michael and I. I saw you guys this afternoon. Brooke, I swear! There's nothing going... You're my best friend! Save it. Brooke! Brooke, what's going on? You tell me what's going on. What happened? Oh, God. Sweetheart, where have you been? I've been worried sick about you. Are you having fun with her? Her who? What are you talking about? Don't insult my intelligence! I saw you and Melissa together. You and my supposed best friend that I don't even know. It isn't like that. Then what was it like? Have dinner with me tonight. Tonight, Le Bistro Provence. Just have dinner with me tonight and I will explain everything. The Bistro Provence, you love that place. Just have dinner with me tonight, and I'll explain everything. Oh, God. Give me one reason to trust you. I'll give you plenty of reasons if you just say yes. Please. Oh, God, okay. Brooke, sweetheart, we gotta go. Coming! Come on, honey, we're late. I'm coming! Thank you. Thank you. Tell me what's bothering you. I talked to Detective Wagner. Okay, what did she have to say? She said that nobody she interviewed knew about our engagement and that Dr. Kaplan didn't find a ring in my possessions. Do you have anything to say about that? Dr. Kaplan was right, there wasn't a ring in your possessions. Okay. There wasn't a ring there because you weren't wearing one. You see, we'd had some problems and things weren't going all that well, to be honest. We had a fight and you just took off. A fight about what? I've learned over the past couple of days that none of that matters. The only important thing is that you're alive and that we're together. Do you remember the last time you wore that dress? It was the night I proposed to you a year and a half ago. We were spending a weekend in the city and we had dinner at this rooftop restaurant that was way too expensive. I love you so much. When you had your accident, I thought for the first time what life might be like without you. You can ask Richard, I was... I was terrified. It was like I had taken you for granted and I was gonna lose you. Please, will you take a look? I don't wanna wait anymore. I can't wait anymore. And Melissa thought you'd like it. A wedding ring. Oh, my God. I know we've never set a date before, but I don't wanna risk losing you ever again. I don't care if it's just you and me on a beach somewhere. I feel like we've been given a second chance at a life together... and I want you to be my wife. Brooke, will you be my wife? I just... I don't know what to say. All this time I thought that you and Melissa... She helped me pick it out. And believe me, she spared no expense. No. She must think I'm horrible. You are. You're a horrible, horrible person. That's exactly why I love you. I spoke to the minister, and we can do it tomorrow at our house. What do you say? Yes. Yes. I'll make all the arrangements. Nothing fancy, I promise. Sweetheart, what's wrong? I just wish that my sister would come. Let's... let's not worry about the past. A toast. To a prosperous and beautiful future. Could you excuse me for a minute? I couldn't help but overhear. Congratulations! Thank you very much. I always thought you made a good couple. Oh, I'm sorry, do I know you? Oh, that's right, I forgot about that... You know? That's all right. I work at the coffee shop. Double-shot hazelnut latte with room for extra cream. That's very good. Ha-ha, like an elephant. I remember when my husband and I got engaged, I was terrified. We were already engaged. Oh. Yeah, we're just making plans for the date. You two were engaged? Wow, I... I had no idea. I never want either of us to forget how much we love each other. Are you sure you wanna do this? I'm sure. Go get 'em. Hello, I'd like to speak to someone in your marketing department. Where might I find it? In your Tucson office, huh? No, it's okay. I'll call directly, thank you. Detective. He told me he was in marketing. I don't... I don't know. Am I crazy? Look, I'll run these for prints and I'll also check employee records for the company and we should be able to get a positive ID, okay? What about Dr. Alvarez? Have you talked to him yet? No. His answering service said he was out of town. We left a message. Y'know, we just had this wonderful dinner and... everything is going so well. I guess I'd be silly to hope that I'm wrong about all this. No. I would, too. Sorry to hear about your accident. Thank you. Now, to answer your question, I don't see mention of an engagement on the account. Now, unless the account holder specifically adds a non-spouse as beneficiary to the account, they'd have no access. What about direct deposit? Is there anything you can show me with income? Whose? Michael. Like I told you, Michael would need to be added. But it's his account. No, ma'am, it's your account. Ms. Harris, this money is yours. You inherited it from your parents. Are there any other accounts that... Not with us. You're sure he said... Yes, he said Emerald Savings & Trust, I'm sure. I'm very, very sure about that. So what you're saying is that he can't get access to this money without my permission. Not unless he was married to you and something happened. Out of curiosity, how much money is in the account? What's wrong with you? This isn't your car. What do you want? What I want? It's me, Reynolds. Your trainer. I had an accident. I'm having a difficult time with faces. Is that why you've been running away from me? You thought... you thought I was trying to hurt you? You came to my house. We had an appointment. I'm sorry, you must think I'm losing my mind. Hey, don't worry about it. I'm... I'm sorry I didn't know. Hey. Here. Call me when you're feeling up to start working out again, okay? Hello? Courtney? Who is this? Brooke. I know that we haven't talked in a while, but I had an accident on the boat. Oh, Brooke. Please, I can't remember... I can't remember my house, my fiancé, Michael. I can't remember why you and I are fighting... Wait a second, you didn't actually get engaged to that deadbeat, did you? And I bet you didn't get a prenup either. Isn't marriage based on trust? You cannot get engaged to a guy that you have only known a couple of months. We've been engaged for longer than that. Listen, Brooke. When Mom and Dad gave us their estate, they put their trust in us. I'll call you back. Who was that on the phone? Oh, it was just a wrong number. Oh, check you out. Hi. Hi. I'm early for my appointment, so I thought I'd come in and check in on the blushing bride. Thanks for the company. He is gonna be so happy. I was feeling the red, what do you think? I think go with it. You know, I was thinking, since you're gonna be the only other girl, you're gonna get the bouquet. Yeah, yeah, I'd rather cut off both my arms than catch it. Oh, wait, y'know what, I'm sorry, one second. Maybe that's him. Hello? I had the station run those prints and got a positive ID. Michael Taylor. Born 1974. Permanent residence listed in Reno, Nevada. And are you ready for this? I found three restraining orders against him from prior girlfriends. Really? And he works for the Bevlyn Bottling Company, and according to the people I spoke to, you two were never engaged. I'm sorry, Brooke. Look, I'm on my way over now. That's okay. Didn't you hear what I just said? The man could be dangerous. I will take care of that, thank you. Brooke? Who was that? Oh, it's just a wedding gift that I was getting Michael. What was that? She hung up. Does she have any idea what kind of trouble she's looking at? I think I'm gonna go. Wait. I wanted to ask you a question. A year and a half ago, when Michael asked me to marry him, what did I say? You said it was the happiest day of your life. See ya. Sweetheart, Brooke? Honey, what's going on? Oh, wow. The minister's gonna be here soon. What's the hurry, honey? It's just us. Sweetheart, the minister's gonna be here any minute. He's not coming. Why? Come on, let's just do this privately, you and I. I like your thinking. First, you know, we should make a toast. Don't you think? Okay. To the future Mr. and Mrs. Coleman. I'll drink to that. Mmm. You remembered my favorite label. Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of things. What else do you remember? Well, I went to the bank today and, you know, they told me the funniest thing. Huh? Yeah. The money, it turns out it's all mine. You mean ours. No, I mean mine. But don't worry, I've transferred it all to an offshore account. What? Just to be safe. I thought that was a really good idea. Why would you do that? Maybe for the same reason you doctored every photo in this house. What? For the reason you put a ring on my finger and made me believe that we were engaged. Sweetheart, I already explained that. Did you ever love me? Let me tell you a little story about a woman who inherits a large sum of money from her parents. She's a little lonely, you know, she doesn't get out very often, she works from home, which makes her vulnerable. And one day, along comes a nice, handsome man. But it turns out he's not so nice. She thinks that he loves her, but all he really wants is her money. He wants to marry her, but she refuses. And when he becomes violent, she tries to run away. The next thing you know, she wakes up in a hospital room, without any of her memories at all! But he, he does everything he can in his power... to make her forget how hard it all really was. I mean, he goes so far, he even gets a friend to pretend to be her psychiatrist. I mean, what was his angle? Was he gonna get a cut of the money, too? It's hard to build a relationship based on lies, isn't it? Brooke? Just in time. She knows. What? She transferred the money. Where? Somewhere you can't touch it. Offshore! What's wrong with him? Well, I guess the sedatives I gave him didn't mix well with the champagne. Where is it? So you were the one following me all the time just waiting for the right moment to make your move. Where? Go ahead and shoot me, but unless we're married, he's not gonna get a dime, which means you're not gonna get a dime. I should have killed you the first time. Oh, yeah, what were you gonna do? Kill me after the wedding and live happily ever after on all of my money? Let me ask you a question. Did he ever hit you? Because there are three women out there with restraining orders against him. Is that the kind of guy that you wanna be with? I mean, it takes a real man to hit a woman, you know what I'm saying? You know, I mean, you really wanna be with a real man... You tell me how to access the account. You don't have a choice. You think you're so smart, huh? You think you got everything figured out! Let me kill her. No, no, no, no, no, no. She's gonna tell us where the money is. You know what your problem's always been? You're too stubborn. No. She's not gonna tell you anything. Oh, yes she is. She's gonna tell me everything I wanna know because she knows there's not gonna be any second chances. Brooke! Brooke! Brooke! Brooke, baby! Just tell me where the accounts are, you'll never see me again! Brooke! Now, where's my money? The honeymoon's never quite how you envisioned it, is it? Yeah, it's over there. No weapons? No, I'm just gonna bag this and head back down. Well, that's fine. Let me get... You're lucky. A neighbor heard gunshots and called it in. We picked up his friend, Dr. Alvarez, trying to get out of town. Who was he? Some doctor that thought being a con artist paid better. He and Michael did this to another girl down in Portland, but I think he's gonna cut a deal, help us put him away. Hopefully he'll never hurt anyone again... thanks to you. So what are you gonna do now? Start over. Rebuild my life. Well... we're ready to take your statement when you're up to it, okay? Thank you. You're welcome. Brooke. Are you okay? I was so worried after you called me. Finding out about the engagement... You were right. He just wanted the money. And all this time, I just thought you were jealous. Maybe I was. But not because of Michael. 'Cause I thought you had something I've always wanted. I should have listened to you. You were in love. Sometimes that makes us do crazy things. I should have been more supportive. I was overly protective about Mom and Dad's estate. It almost cost me my only sister. Can I come stay with you for a couple of days? I love you, sis. I love you, too.
