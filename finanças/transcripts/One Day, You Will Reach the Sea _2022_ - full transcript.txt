The train isn't coming. But I need to get home. The train won't pass, so go by foot. Don't look behind you. Just keep walking. Deeply. Deeply. Kotani. Is everything alright? - Your eyes. - My eyes? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Pardon me. - Good. - Excuse me. Good evening. Would you like to order? Two whiskeys with ice, and a bottle of 12y Yamazaki. Right away. Two whiskeys with ice, and a bottle of 12y Yamazaki. OK. Is there a secret to picking the right music? No secret, I just ask myself what the guests would like to hear. I watch the customers and pick an album that suits them. That seems rather difficult. No, it isn't. And you? What music do you listen to? Puffy, for example. Puffy, huh? They aren't a band from your generation. My friends liked them. I understand. The customer allergic to shellfish has enjoyed this dinner. Ah, really? - Kotani, someone's looking for you. - What? He said he'll wait for you by the entrance. OK. Carbonara. I'm busy too, you know. Tomorrow, I'm going to see Sumire's Mom. So today's the last day. You're quick only in these circumstances. Come with me tonight? The rest are Sumire's things. After you organize them, I'll bring them to her mother, and throw away what's left. You're really moving. I found a nice apartment close to my new job. Do you have any other stuff from her? Of course. What have you done? I'm keeping them. How is her room? Are you fine? Yes. It feels weird. I don't usually see... ...my friends' accessories and clothes publicly. It's normal when someone dies. Do you want me to throw them away? I haven't decided yet whether to get rid of them. Want to visit her mother with me? We'll bring her the things and let her decide. I don't want to throw them away either. OK. I'm going to sleep, I need to get up early. Can I rest as well? Certainly. Tono. To be honest, I've always... ...been with you... ...and I've never liked you that much. What's with that? Let's get some rest. Come visit sometime! Hey, are you interested? Hey, you're a freshman, right? Have you chosen a club already? We're called Smash. Do you like tennis? It's super fun! A freshman? Cool! Join our club, otherwise you'll remain single. - Don't scare her. - But it's the truth. Getting off on the right foot is important. Tonight, we're having a welcome party. Freshmen don't pay. Can you write down your name? Just your name, please. Write it. Come on, take the pen. Pick up the pen! - Write! - Almost done. Can I enter as well? You're a freshman? Nice! - Which faculty? - Literature. - I knew it. - It's written all over your face. Write my name. - You're joining? - Yes. Great! We have two freshmen! How cute! What's your name? - Sumire. - How cute! Smash! There was no timer. Did it come out fine? - Isn't she cute? - Yeah, very! How envious! My clothes? When I bought them, I was strolling around. I don't remember. Does everyone have a glass? Thanks for coming to the Smash's freshmen party! One, two, three... Cheers! The freshmen are drinking the next. You haven't drank it yet? Drink! Drink! You can do it! Come on, come on! Good! Very good! Are you feeling okay? You're unable to vomit? May I? Don't bite me. - Where were you? - Were you initiated? You look like a doll. I get told that often. What high school were you in? Same one as you. - It's not famous. - We know of it, yes. - Were there also boys? - Yes, it was mixed. - We thougt it was a girls' school. - Why? Did you have a boyfriend? - Who knows? - That's a yes! You're such a virgin. Come right away. - That's not true, You're not funny. - It's not funny. Did you have a boyfriend? - Of course not. - I don't believe you. Really? You don't have any experience? - Are you a virgin? - Get with me. - No, choose me. - I'm better. - Quiet, virgin. - I want to be your first man. Excuse me. Me and her are from the same high school. Come on, Mana. Idiocy is contagious. - Idiocy? - We're not idiots. - Did you call us idiots? - Hey, come back here. - Don't leave. - Hey, wait. What university? Students? Do you work? Excuse me. I left in a panic and did something strange. Sorry if I made you unconfortable. Don't worry about it. I was scared as well. You didn't seem like it. They're all the same. True. I thought that university would be different, but it's always the same story. However, I went to girls' schools. Since kindergarten. I didn't want to give it up those those idiots, so I lied. What's your name? Sumire Utsuki. You can call me Sumire. I'm Mana Kotani. Call me Mana. I chose Literature as well. Like you. Pleased to meet you. Let's go eat at a better place. That fried chicken was the worst. 2 March 2005, 10:52, sunny. Hey, stop it. I feel uncomfortable if you film me. Sorry. It calms me down instead. You're strange. What were you saying before? I think you were scared. Scared? Maybe I'm just relieved now that we broke up. Then, don't be sad. You know, it's that... Before we got together, I liked it so much. But these stupid problems continued to appear. Really stupid ones. For example? When he was sitting down, if he was stressed he would make the table fly with his legs. What a nuisance. He volounteered to help children, but it was just for the curriculum. - Oh, damn. - Right? And at the "all you can eat" buffet he always ordered too much and never finished it. - He didn't finish what he started? - Exactly! That's bad. So what did you like about him? Good question. Now that I think about it... His face's profile. The fact that he was a volunteer. The things I liked about him were very superficial and frivolous. I understand. Want to play scrabble? "Shitsuren" (delusion of love). Oops! "Shoushin ryokou" (nostalgic trip). Now with "U". "U"? - "Uchuu" (universe). - "Umi" (ocean). "Miren" (lingering feelings). Finished. Wow. Are we there yet? A bit more. Let's give up. Why? We're almost there. - You sure? - Yes. I see it. Do you see it? It's the sea! Yes! Are you feeling okay? I'm fine. And you? I like walking. Do you know how to get to the hotel? I like getting lost. I don't want to get lost. But it's so pretty. What are you thinking about? I was wondering why I feel calmer when I'm with my camera. Why? I think... ...that we only see one side of this world. In other words? It's difficult to explain. What profound thoughts. And you? What were you thinking about? Well... I wasn't thinking about anything. Got it. If you feel safe with someone and want to be together, okay, but if it's not like that, I don't think you need to force yourself to be with someone. Feeling safe? I wonder what that means. Someone who loves you deeply, and puts you before everything else. Deeply, deeply? Yes. Deeply, deeply. Deeply, deeply. Deeply, deeply. Deeply, deeply. Sorry for the wait. You came. What happened? Don't say anything and pick me up. what are you saying? I always wanted to tell that joke. Your hair. What do you think? It's like you always had it like this. - As if. - I mean it. Can I get on? Well, you're already here. It's been a while. Two months? We haven't ever been apart for so long. You're always busy. Thanks. It's raining. - I'm all wet. - You're soaked. - Yes. - Take a shower. Thanks. He'd always get mad if you sat cross-legged. Your ex. That was a lifetime ago. He was so bothersome. "My girl does not sit like that." Who do you think you are, my father? Don't force me to do anything. Yes? Everyone unconsciously forces someone to do something. You don't make me do anything. Your apartment is relaxing. Really? - It's like the bottom of the ocean. - What a strange description. I want to create places that put people at ease, make them feel safe. You're lucky, you have a goal. You want to work for the Nishikawa furniture factory, right? But the headquarters are in Kyoto. Kyoto isn't bad. Do you want to stay here? No, I didn't mean that, but I don't want to go somewhere so far away. I see. I think you'd be fine anywhere. Is there a place you'd like to go? I don't know. At the moment, I want to stay at your apartment. Eat the last one. What a big storm. I'd be afraid if I were alone. I want to be able to talk easily to everyone, like you do. You just have to tune in. Tune in? Yeah, like a radio. I might end up not liking myself, it scares me. But, if you do, you could end up meeting someone... ...who could draw out your real self while you spend time together. I think I have such a person already. Really? Who? When did you meet? Is he from your class? It's a secret. Oh, come on! It's scary, but we're alive. It hurts and tickles me. That's because you're alive. Goodnight. 'Night. Mana. Sorry, the lesson just never seemed to end. - Did you eat? - No, I'm fine. I wanted to introduce you to someone. This is Atsushi Tono. I'm Tono. Pleased to meet you. I'm Kotani. Sumire told me that you are her landlady. Do you play the guitar? He's not very good at it. Hey, I'm still learning. Thanks to him, I can sing without going to the karaoke. Isn't she annoying? Maybe I'll eat something. I'll go. The usal, right? Sing, Mana. Sumire, Tono and Mana came to see you. Is that Sanshiro? Yes. I heard a lot about Sanshiro. Sumire adored him. She called him that. I'll get you some tea. Sanshiro. Sanshiro. Sanshiro. Please sit down. He's like Sumire. He's shy and doesn't give his trust easily. Please. Me and her got along well when we were little. But at middle school... ...she looked me in the eyes and said: "You're either on my side or daddy's. Don't you have your own opinions?" We haven't gotten along since then, and then she went to study somewhere else. So... ...even though she never returned, it seemed to me like we returned to our initial relation. I think I understand her a bit. I sometimes feel closer to her now, than I did in the past. She could be distant at times, even if she were right beside you. She always liked blue. It fit her beautifully. Why don't you try it? Don't you want to see as well, Tono? I think Sumire would like that. Please, try it. It suits you. Really? Thank you. It really fits you. Not at all. No, it fits you. Get out, I'm changing. Oh, sorry. Here. Thanks. Can you get the stuff from the back? Her video camera? Her mother didn't take it. She must have thought that if she saw the video, something would have ceased to exist. Did you see it? I don't have the courage to. I feel like she would want you to. You're just forcing me to do it. Maybe. Only Sumire knows how she felt. They are all arrogant. Maybe you're right. We're desperately trying to protect ourselves. I got engaged. Sumire's already dead in you and her mother's heart, right? You might not like it, but I understand how her mother feels. I've decided to quit trying to make her live inside of me. And don't you imagine her trapped forever in the same place? 21° floor. Hello. Hello. Are you the last ones? There's stil Narahara. OK. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey, what's the matter? Today's your day off. I don't think there's much I can do to help. No, in fact... Should we drink something? - Here you go. - Pardon me. - To be honest, sometimes I do this. - I didn't know. But I pay precisely for this. You are extremely correct. Do you usually listen to jazz? Not at all. Jazz is not one of my favourites. I used to like heavy metal... Do you young ones know Metallica? I loved that stuff. Heavy metal? I just don't see you liking it. Do you still listen to it? I'm not sure... ...what music I like, or used to listen to. Is that how it works? I can't imagine seeing you listen to Puffy too. What are you doing? Play! Hey, what's the matter? Were you practicing? Sing! Sing, Tono! Tono... 25 October 2007, Thursday. I'm about to say farewell to the place I've stayed at for more than a year. That's all, right? I'll bring back the van. I'll go help Tono. Okay. I worry about the way he drives. How's your girlfriend? She's a normal person. What? Sumire wasn't normal. I wonder what that means. Maybe she was extraordinarily normal. You might be right. You knew her better than me. I feel relieved, however. When you got out of the car, I was afraid we'd never see each other again. In short, you knew nothing about her. Even if you were with her. Here's the bill, I'm closing. There aren't any more trains, huh? This is where we came last time... Me and Sumire. I wonder what she was really like. Have you watched her videos? Those videos are not meant for others to watch. So you shouldn't watch them without her permission. Maybe you're right. But... ...maybe she would want you to watch them? And what would you know? OK, let's head back. Good day. Did you know we have a new dish each day? Yes, I know. Where's Narahara? I don't think she's arrived yet. It's not from him. Bright Coast. Kotani speaking. - Kotani. - Oh, Narahara. Sorry, today I'll arrive a bit late. OK, I'll open up then. Thank you. Did you go over the instructions for today? Do you need some help? I've made sure, everything will be under control. Oh, and the music? Why don't you put on some music that you like? May I, really? Bye. Later. The boss? He'll be a bit late. OK. He's not picking up? No. Yagi, could you think about it? He gave instructions for everything. Serve this. I'll go see what's going on. I'll call you when I have some news. OK. - Akashi, make the pasta. - OK. Would you like to order? A glass of red whine for me, and a Mimosa for my wife. Perfect. A glass of red wine and a Mimosa for table ten. Kunikida is on the telephone. Kotani speaking. Sorry for the delay. It's no problem. What's going on? Narahara passed away. I'm at the police station. Her family is here. I need to answer some questions, so I'll be a little late. I'll let everyone know he's gone. At the end of the evening, gather everyone and wait for me. Kotani? Kotani? But I just spoke to him. He was on the phone before the meeting. He told me he'd be a bit late, he asked me if I needed help. Kotani. When you hang up, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and drink a fresh glass of water. Okay. I'll see you later. You must be hungry. How did Narahara die? He hung himself in the bathroom. I heard he worked in the design department, but had issues with his boss, and everything got worse from there. Did he not like working here? Well, we can only theorize but it wouldn't make sense. Whatever was the reason, he's not coming back. My best friend never came back herself. The tsunami took her away. I wonder what Narahara saw before dying. Playback of saved messages. 2 November 2009, 18:34. Mana, it's been a while. How are you? I just wanted to hear your voice. Call me back. 13 June 2010, 11:07. Mana, how are things? How's your job? I'll call you back. 21 February 2011, 20:21. How are you? I forgot to call. Call me sometime. Bye. To delete the message... I'm Kanzaki, the new boss. Last week a tragedy has occurred, but our job is to offer a steady service to our customers. I can't wait to work with you all. Pleased to meet you. Kotani, can I speak to you for a moment? - Yes. - Pardon me. Could you take those things somewhere else? But we put on those CDs... From now on, we will be using a radio. Let's get rid of useless things. Oh, and you are the head waitress, so you must instruct the new arrivals. Certainly. Narahara's collection, huh? The restaurant's atmosphere will change. That's normal when the management changes. Even if someone passes away, everything still moves on. If employees weren't replaceable, that would be a huge problem. It's like he was never here. For me, he was a too friendly and mysterious boss, but, for you, it was different. Kunikida, have you ever listened to Metallica? Yes. The last time we talked, Narahara said: "Put on music that you like". You've accumulated paid holidays, haven't you? Isn't there a place you'd like to go? To be honest, yes... Somewhere I haven't been for a while. The first two years, I often went to see her. But I got scared. I didn't want to find her, but I also felt that I needed to find her. I get it. It's hard to think that it's here. I know, it's normal for things to change, but... If I'm being honest... If I'm being honest, I believe I'm slowly forgetting things. I get it. OK, Igarashi. Please state your name and age. I'm Hideko Igarashi. Last Februrary I turned 73. Let me tell you my story. An enormous tsunami had arrived that wiped out me, my husband and my uncle. I lost hold of my uncle. My husband and I were swept away. And he cried out my name, "Hideko!", three times. He had never called me by name with such emotion. This may seem innapropriate, but I thought: "He still remembers my name". That's how I felt. My husband was a quiet man who never spoke much, but when he did something, he did it for me. I loved that about him. Because I'm a careless person. The smell and sound of the sea are imprinted in my mind since I was little, so I never thought of it as anything in particular. But, when a friend visited from Saitama, he told me he couldn't sleep because of the sound of the waves. And I thought: "What sound?" I didn't notice it at the beginning. It seems like it's only noisy for those not used to it. Now I live ten... maybe fifteen kilometres... ...from where I used to live. And I often feel at home. But the sound of the sea... Oh, I mean its smell, and the sounds of the waves, I don't hear them anymore. Before the earthquake and the tsunami, my grandfather had a bar at the port. I lived there... Or better, I went there after school. That place was swept away by the tsunami, so if I could go back in time, I would like to go to that place and see the people who lived there again. I'm Hazumi Ito. I'm in first grade. My father and grandma are still missing after the tsunami. My parents ran a hotel, and one time for my birthday we decided to go to an aquarium, but a guest missed the day of arrival, so we didn't go. These things happened often, and so we couldn't go. That's why I don't have many memories with my father. I don't remember much of him, and that's a bit sad. Me and my grandma... ...often took walks along the beach, and gathered shells. Or we counted the boats, and I had so much fun spending time with her. She taught me many traditional children's songs. I still, and will always, remember those beautiful moments with her. Those shopping trips with her, but also the landscape and the wonderful smells. I'll treasure them forever. Thanks, Hazumi. You should speak too, Mom. Do it, Sachie. Come on! Me? No. - Speak. - Really? - OK. - Ready? Hey, where's the button? Come on, it's the red one. This? Ready? Here we go. Serve yourselves. Thanks. One for you. Thank you. Why did you come here? My best friend still hasn't returned. She liked to travel alone. We know she was in this area at the time of the earthquake and tsunami. I understand. Was she form Tokyo? Yes. Why do you make these recordings? I ask that myself... On one hand to console us, but also to leave a trace. Shooting videos was my husband's hobby, so... - Want me to get you on camera as well? - No, that's fine. What will you do today? I haven't decided yet. Why don't you stay with us? We have a hotel. Are you sure? Of course, please eat. Thank you. Sorry, mom is cooking. - Sorry. - It's no problem. Is the room okay? Well, no... - Seperate rooms, if that's okay. - Sure. Here you go. Thanks. I'll show you the rooms. You're up early. Were you able to get any sleep? I had a dream. It's been so long since I had one. What was it about? Would you sing me an old children's song? I'll sail to the sky and honor the mountains I'll sail to the sky and return to earth I'll sail to the sky and flow in the rivers One day, one day I'll reach the sea Thank you. What's the meaning of the song? I'm not sure myself, but it's a song about a wife who waits for her husband who died at sea. My grandma sang it to me. I see. What's Tokyo like? I can't explain it. Would you want to go? I'm not sure. I'd like to go to university there. I want to study foreign languages and travel abroad. But I haven't told my mother yet. Ah, really? Sounds like a good plan. - The melody doesn't go like that. - No? I just had a good sleep. I was dreaming. What were you dreaming about? Uhm... I don't really remember. I made you some coffee. Thanks. See you later. Leaving already? You sleep like the dead. Did you choose a club? We're called Smash. Do you like tennis? It's super fun! A freshman? Cool! Can I sign up as well? Are you a freshman? How cute! - Literature. - It's written all over your face. Put down my name. You're signing up? Yes! We have two freshmen! Are you okay? You can't live by yourself. I can't work in a place where they tell me what colour my hair needs to be. That's just what a company does. That's the only way you see things, right? You know nothing about the world. Mom, you don't have an identity. And do you have one? Sorry for the wait. You came. I understand. I think you would be fine anywhere. Is there a place you'd like to go? I don't know. At the moment, I want to stay at your apartment. Eat the last one. I want to be able to talk easily to everyone, like you do. You just have to tune in. Tune in? Yeah, like a radio. I might end up not liking myself, it scares me. But if you do, you could end up meeting someone... ...who could draw out your real self while you spend time together. I think I have such a person already. Really? Who? When did you meet? Is he from your class? It's a secret. Oh, come on! She sleeps like a rock. I didn't like my clothes, so I borrowed some of yours. - Sumire What was your favourite pastime in elementary school? Hide and seek. Why? Because I liked it. OK. So what's the most important thing in your life? I don't know. You're not fun to interview. You don't talk without your camera, right? You found me out... You want to move in together? Don't say things you don't mean. What about Kotani? Are you jelous? No. Put that away. You said you wanted to stay with her. I can't stay with her forever. Why not? Do you want to live together? 25 October 2007, Thursday. I'm about to say farewell to the place I've stayed at for more than a year. Mana. That's all, right? I'll bring back the van. What's the matter? I'll go help Tono. Okay. I worry about the way he drives. I'm always on my feet, so my legs are swelling. Whoever works part-time leaves one hour earlier than us... - For you. Fried chicken. - Thank you. They're leaving us with the hardest work. Terrible. Should we go out together again? Next week, I'll be away for work, call me when I get back. Where are you going? To see the ocean. How nice. This cut looks good on you. It's like you always had it like that, right? That takes me back. Go ahead. I'll wait for the bus to arrive. The cat-shaped purse... Nothing, forget about it. Tell me. You've always been someone who can't ever fake a smile. You think so? You're stronger than you think. See you. See you next time. Hello. Hello. Where are you from? Tokyo. Tokyo, huh? That's quite far. It took a while to get here. Did you come by yourself? Yes. Don't you feel alone? If I travel by myself, I can go at my own pace, so I don't mind. You're young. The train's late. The train won't come. 13 May. Sunny. 17:51. Do you remember the day we first met? That sunny day? Or was it cloudy? I don't think I ever gave you back that coloured elastic... ...that you used to tie my hair with. I wonder where it is now. I just realized it was gone. But I didn't throw it away. Sumire. Can you hear me? Can you see me from where you are? Right now, here, there's the sun. ONE DAY, YOU WILL REACH THE SEA
