Baby, are you awake? I'm awake now. So I was thinking we could spend the day together. Maybe after a little morning sex we could go jogging. I can't, babe. I gotta meet with Swiss and I'm already late. Got some last minute repairs before the city inspector show. I thought you were almost done with everything. Well... Yeah, but still gotta do some stuff. Need the deadline for the grand opener. Okay. What else do you have to do? Maybe I could help. It's alright, babe. Okay. Who is texting you this early in the morning? It's not even eight o'clock. Hello? I know you can hear me talking to you. Yeah, I'm sorry, babe. It's nobody special. Okay. I swear. It's just work. The vendor for the liquor company that I'm working with, they coming through today. I'm just confirming the time. That's all. Okay. I gotta get dressed. And here I was thinking we would be getting it in. Mm, mm, mm. Oh, that's okay, baby. I know your daddy loves me and you. Woo. Geez. Ah, and just where do you think you're going dressed like a male thottie? What? Male thottie? - Mm-hmm. - What? You funny. I mean, don't get me wrong, you looking fine as hell. Thank you. But isn't this a little too casual for your daily meetings? Although I do have a lot of meetings. I also gotta help Swiss paint today. Oh yes. Okay. Okay. Just trying to make sure you're not all cute for your little side chick, that's all. Stop it. Come here. There's no other woman that can compare to you, alright? My front, my back, side and only chick. Alright? Okay. But baby, do I look fat? What? Of course not. No. Be, be for real with me. I mean, I know I have a belly, obviously a big belly. But what about the rest of me? Shayla, you are fine, right? You're just pregnant. So what's on your schedule for today? Oh, you know, baby stuff. Doctor's appointments. I gotta get the rest of the furniture for the nursery. And I need to track down Tamika so we can finish planning this baby shower. A lot. Sounds fun. Don't overdo it. Alright? Make sure you get some rest. I will. Remember that is my baby you carrying in there. So, when are you getting in tonight? Not too late. That's what you said yesterday. I know. And you didn't get here until after 1:00 a.m. I know. I know. Look, I just had a lot to do for the grand opening. I promise, tonight it'll be earlier. Promise? I promise. I just don't like being here by myself late at night. That's all. I know. I got you. Look, I'll even call you every hour. Alright? Okay. Wait, you're not gonna eat breakfast with me? I can't. I'm running late. I love you though. I love you too. Wow. This is nice. This is all you got done? Thought you'd be finished. You're kidding me, right? Need I remind you that I am a bartender, bro. And I've been working two jobs trying to finish up all this painting. And I still made it in here before you did this morning. So instead of critiquing, you need to be picking up a paintbrush, bro. Point taken. You right. Man, but you know this pregnancy got Shayla hella needy man. Don't even get me started on how clingy she been for the past two weeks. It'll be over soon though. Y'all on the home stretch now. Oh facts. Can you believe she's six months now? - Whew, six months. - Six months. That's crazy. That's why I'm working so hard to get this damn place running like a well oiled machine. I'm trying to spend at least two weeks with Shayla and the new baby. You know what I'm saying? Well, I got your back, partner. All this hard work we've been doing gonna pay off. Oh, for sure. You know we got it, man. So yeah, let's get to it. Marcus Sinclair? Hi, I'm, I'm, I'm Marcus. Hi, Rocki Robinson with Premium Distributions. Hey, so you, you Rocki, huh? I was uh, I was, I was expecting. I know, a guy, right? It happens all the time. Rocki's actually short for Raquel. No, I was actually expecting you a little later. That's all. But this is my business partner Rob Swiss. You can call me Swiss. Nice to meet you. Oh okay. Nice to meet you, Ms. Robinson. Okay, Rocki, please. So this is a very, very nice spot that you gentlemen have here. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, you wanna take this to my office so we can talk shop? Yep, sure. This way? Yeah, you just go this way. I'm sorry for the mess. Just get stuff together. Okay. Hmm. Your girlfriend? Uh no, my wife actually. Expecting our first kid in a couple months. It's a boy. Oh! Congratulations. - Thank you. - It's funny, 'cause I don't think I remember reading anything about you being married in the "Chicago's Nightlife Magazine". Too bad. Uh yeah. Old interview and before we got married. I think we've been married what uh, seven months now? Hmm. You want? Have a seat please. Thank you. Can I be honest with you? I was, I was actually expecting a guy. You know, like Rocki from the movies? It's fine. I'm not surprised. Nobody expects a woman, especially a black woman in this line of business. Hopefully that won't be a problem. Oh no. No problem at all. Observation though, it says a lot about you, huh? The alcohol beverage industry is not for the weak. No, it's not. But let's be real. The only reason I'm assigned to certain accounts, including yours, is because nobody cares about a new black business owner. But it's cool. I don't mind. Let them continue to count us out while I continue to bring us in. Okay, I see you, Rocki. I hope so. Let's get down to business. So born and raised in Chicago, majored in hospitality management, graduated summa laude from an HBCU. Did the restaurant thing for a while, dabbled in party promotions. Then you did the club thing for a while. The last bar, you managed it quite well. Glad to see you finally ventured out and made something happen for yourself. Wow. I can't believe you know all of this. It's part of my job. I mean, our company just checks for credit, but I like to, you know, dig a little deeper and see exactly who I'm gonna be working with. Ah. I did my research and I'm impressed. Okay. Hopefully you impressed enough to give us a good deal on that liquor. I'm willing to do whatever I can to make Flirt one of the best bars in Chicago. Here's what I can offer you as a new account. Wow. These, these numbers are incredible. Mm-hmm. I like to look out for my people. We're all we got, you know? Yeah, I do. And you have definitely looked out. Makes me proud to be a Black man. But you, you sure you can offer me this? Seems a bit too good to be true. Let's just say I have the power to create a premium package for my new clients. Especially ones that are as talented as you. Thank you? I mean, I, I really wasn't expecting this. I told you it's part of my job. It's fine. Oh, here is a list of vendors as well. Make sure you contact them. Tell 'em Rocki sent you. That way they'll give you a good discount. Do you go this hard for all of your customers? Only the ones I like. And I like you, Marcus. Well, thank you. And I look forward to working with you. Me too. It's this way. So I think you guys have a great thing going here. - Thank you. - This is gonna be pretty successful. Whatever I can do then. I appreciate that. I like this color. Very chic. Thank you. I picked it out. So when do you guys open? Uh, in three weeks. - Three weeks? - Yeah. Just for like a soft launch, right? Nope, that's, that's opening night. And it's just the two of you? Where's your contractor? You know what we thought about that. It's outta budget. - Hey! - It is. Look, I know a guy. He's very reasonable. I'll have him give you guys a call so he can come by and help out. Okay? Thanks Rocki. But you know, you don't, you don't have to do that. What my partner is trying to say is that we appreciate anything you can do. It's no problem. His name's George Matthews. He's a friend of mine. I'm always throwing business his way, so. He owes me a favor. Here is his number. Make sure you give him a call. Okay? Thanks. I will do that. Okay, well if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have other clients to attend to. So good luck and yeah, I'll call you later this week to just make sure everything's good to go. - Sounds good. - Alright. Bye. This way right? - Uh, yeah. - Thanks. I might have to marry her. Yeah, she is something else. What'd she say about that liquor though? Did we get the account? Yeah, she gave us like a major deal for the first six months too. And she threw in some vendors that's gonna keep the bar stocked. So we good. A woman that's beautiful, fine and resourceful? I'mma have to come after her. Bro, could you at least wait until after we get this thing up and running? I don't know, bro. I'mma have to say something. You know me. I about to, I'm about to get a brush, bro. Yes please.

Now what do you want? Whew, a nap. That's what I want. Girl, I'm so tired all the time. I can barely even run my usual route anymore. Well you know, most pregnant women are tired, boo. It comes with the territory. That's what you get for having unprotected sex. I'm fat, I'm slow, I'm unattractive. Marcus doesn't even wanna go running with me anymore. He's not turned on at all. Uh oh. All he cares about is that damn bar. No, no, no, no. That is not true. Okay? You're overreacting, babe. And being hormonal. - No, I'm not. - Yuh huh. He's always there. Always. Starting to feel like he just wants to be away from me. Okay. Marcus is just trying to get the bar open before the baby comes, now you said so yourself. Look, you're bored as hell. That's all. Now. I told your ass not to quit work so soon. Should have listened to me. Well Marcus didn't want me working past my second trimester. Mm hmm. I can't help it if my husband wants me to rest and relax while he takes care of me and the baby. Right. Be jealous. So now you bragging about him taking care of you. Child, you really are confused and hormonal. - It's a real thing. - Mm-hmm. - I am. - So are we going to the grand opening? Um... Probably not. - Oh? - Yeah, I don't, I don't wanna wobble my pregnant ass in there looking crazy when there's gonna be pretty bitches everywhere. Nuh uh. Girl, get your ass up. Come on, let's go. Why? Where are we going? Shopping so we can get your pretty ass an outfit for you to wobble in at opening night. Come on girl. Come on. Get on up, get on up. Oh god. Oh my god. That's right. Come on, Mom. You go girl. You go girl. ♪ Are you sliding on 'em Mickey gonna put your hands in the air. Hey. Right here. So I am glad you could make it. Now you know I wasn't gonna miss the grand opening. Ladies, this is Marcus. He's one of the owners of Flirt. Nice to meet you, Marcus. We heard so much about you. Nice to meet you too. Appreciate y'all coming out. You know this would not be possible without your friend here. Okay friend. Rocki! Here's a little something to say thank you. Grab one of those. Ladies, y'all want one? Here. Got something for everybody. Let's go. Let's make a toast, to a beautiful evening filled with lots of beautiful ladies. To Flirt. To Flirt. And, and a special thanks to Rocki. 'Cause once again, if it was not for you, we could have not got this finished in time. And the contractor you sent through, clutch. Look, I'm just glad everything worked out, okay? Congratulations again, Marcus. Thank you. - Flirt - To Flirt! Okay, this place is rockin'! Alright. Well done, Marcus. Yeah. Rockin' with all these thirsty women. Oh. Uh ho. Come on Shayla. Look, don't be ridiculous. Now this is your man's big night. Be here so these chicks will see that your man got a wife, and a beautiful one at that. So can we go to the bar? Please. Okay. Okay. It's the grand opening of Flirt. Make some noise... Hey Swiss. Hey ladies. I didn't expect to see y'all up in here tonight. Now why would you think that? I mean, I am his wife. Because you're pregnant. That's, that's why I thought that. Here. Come here, have a seat. Thanks. - And you too. - Oh! Please, Tamika. Let your fine self sit down. Excuse me ladies. My special guests have arrived. Baby! Hey. Hey baby. I didn't think you was coming. God girl, you look so good. Thank you. Thank you for bringing her, Tamika. Of course. You know, I figured being with the owner's wife means I get to drink for free all night. So, you know. Well with you looking that good I'll probably let you do that anyway. Whew, well in that case, let me get a shot of tequila with a glass of rose all day. Okay? Thank you. Baby, I really hope that you driving home tonight, because from the looks of it, it don't look like Mika gonna make it. Right. Look at these two. You know, I could get a ride. Congratulations, Marcus. Thank you. Yeah, this place is lit. You boys was definitely getting it. - Definitely did. - I, I, I appreciate it. Enjoy yourselves. - We will. - Yeah, you too. Baby, you okay? No. I'm not feeling well. Well, you know, I, I can take you home. No, no baby. It's your big night. You should stay. Mika can take me. Oh yeah. I can? Yes. Yeah, I can. Okay. I get you. Just some sugar. You're too much, man. Oh shit. Sorry. You still here? Where your friends? Oh, they left a while ago. Your friends left you here? I, I know that's gotta be against girl code or something, right? I told them they could go. I wanted to stay longer, plus, you know, they knew I'd be in good hands. Well hey, we definitely not gonna let anything happen to you, that's for sure. Or we could let something happen, Marcus, you know, just to celebrate opening night. I'm good, Rocki. I'm good. That was celebration enough out there, you know, the toast with your friends. Oh, well let me get back out here to Rob. It's almost last call. Okay. - Hey baby. - Hey! How was the rest of your night? It was good. Go back to sleep. Oh, what time is it? 4:00 a.m.! Marcus! Really? - I know. - Come on. I know, I know, I know. Look, I'm sorry. I just, I had to check the receipts, you know, make sure everything was good for the next day. Okay. When are you hiring a manager? I don't know. I guess sometime this week. I mean, I just was really trying to get through this, this opening. Like what you need to hire is a bodyguard to keep all these beautiful women away from you. Come on now. You know it ain't even like that. I can go to work and, and I come right back here. Okay. Don't look at me and lie and act like I'm the crazy one here. I saw you with my own eyes. You saw who? The chick in the green dress! Yeah, she was doing the most all in your face, laughing and flirting and I peeped all of that. Wait, you talking about Rocki? Baby, that's the sales rep for the liquor company. She came through to congratulate us on a, a successful opening. Hell, she hugs Swiss too, as she should. We made her a ton of money. - Oh. - Mm. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. I just, I think it's just with me being pregnant and you not being here as much, I've been kind of crazy the past couple of weeks. Yeah, a little bit. - Mm. - But I understand. I promise it's gonna get easier. I'm not gonna have to be there all the time. Okay. And the next time one of the girls touch, hit they ass with a whoo! My wife is watching you. She probably watching you and she crazy as hell and she don't want nobody touching her man. Damn right. Better let 'em know. Oh my God. Come here, come here. Oh, he's doing something. Oh, he is doing, he's moving, moving. Oh my gosh. Your son agrees. Hands off ladies. Hey son. This lady, your mama, she is crazy. But I think we gonna be all right. I love you. I love you. Well, since I ain't gotta sneak in the bed, I may go get on some proper sleep clothes. So precious. Hey girl. What you doing? I've been trying to call you all morning. I spent the morning in bed getting some vitamin D from my husband. Oh, about time. Now maybe you can act right and chill out since Marcus gave you something. Because... I know, I know I have been tripping, especially since I saw him hugged up with that one girl. But he explained to me who she was. So everything's good. We're good. Shayla! What's happening? Answer me! Oh my God. Hello? Hello? I need some help. I need some help. Yes. My neighbor's been hit by a car. Oh my God. Okay. Shayla, you okay? You're okay? Good? You're doing fine. Your baby's fine. Hold on. Hold on. On the way. It's so dark in here. Let some light in. Close it. No, I'm not gonna do that. That's what you do every day. All you do is sleep, get in the shower and get back in the bed. Okay, I'm sorry if I'm not bright-eyed and bushy-tailed enough for you. That's, that's not, that's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying you never go outside anymore. May, maybe you should try running again. What? Running? You really think I feel like running after losing my baby. Alright, baby. You're not the only one that lost someone here. I'm the one who carried him in my belly. Not you. And while we're talking about it, where the hell were you again the day of the accident? Mika called you a hundred times and you took forever to show up to the hospital. I told you where I was. I was at the bank. I was, I was at the bank. Right, yeah, you keep saying that. And your phone didn't ring, right? My phone didn't ring because it was on silent, Shayla, I keep telling you that, it was on silent. As soon as I took it off, I got the notification of what happened and I rushed to you immediately. The fact of the matter is, Marcus, you were not there with me. I was there all alone. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't touch me. I, I keep apologizing over and over again for the hundred thousandth time, I am sorry. Marcus, you don't get it. It doesn't matter how many times you say sorry, that will never ever bring my baby back. You act like it's my fault. You act like what happened was my fault. Like I was, like I was driving the car. Okay, you think I care whose fault it was, Marcus? Just trying to, just trying to help. Well, you're not, you're not helping. Why don't you just, just leave. Leave me alone. Alright, I know that's your pain speaking, but I've been trying to give you time to think about all this and if something don't change, things do not change, Shayla, Just not gonna make it. So ladies, we're gonna start with Shayla. Shayla, can you tell us what brings you comfort right now, if anything? Comfort? Nothing. How could I feel comfort? Two months ago I lost my baby. And now I'm pretty sure my husband is cheating on me. Damn, girl, that's messed up. Do you have proof he's cheating? No, but he's surrounded by beautiful woman all the time. And when he gets home, he's frustrated with me. He says he's tired of me acting like I can't move on. That doesn't mean that he's cheating. Could it be that he's tried to connect with you? All we do is argue. And I know he doesn't even like being around me anymore. It's gotta be another woman. I've been cheated on before and I know the signs. Me too, girl. Yeah, that's how my boyfriend was acting when he was cheating. He stayed complaining about me. Look ladies, ladies, we are here to talk about how we feel and what we need to be in a happier place. So with that, Shayla, can you please tell us how you're feeling? I feel... empty inside. Like I'm just wandering through life with nowhere to go. My baby is gone and I spend most of my days alone at home while Marcus is at work. And when he does try to be affectionate with me, I, I don't want him to touch me. I resent him, honestly. And why is that? Why are you rejecting him? Because he's doing it out of obligation and pity. I don't feel attractive. I have all this baby weight and no baby. My hair sheds because of the hormones. I just, I don't even try to fix myself up anymore because it's pointless. I don't, I don't think I'm ever gonna feel better. You will, you will. It just takes time. Look, and guess what, you comin' here today, it's the start of you getting better. - Really? - Yes! Now all you have to do is take that first step. Which is? You have to talk to your husband. You have to tell him how you feel. Not the details of what happened, but how you're feeling. You talk first and you allow him the opportunity to respond. Listen to how he's feeling as well. Can you do that? Yes. Okay. Good. Good. Well ladies, that's our time. So thank you so much for coming with me today. I really appreciate you. Now you my girl for life. I got you. Now you know that. And look, I am glad that you're working through some of this stuff, 'cause child, it's a lot. Yeah, it is. But today helped. Okay. It made me feel not good, but a little okay. And guess what? What? You know, what else might make you feel even more okay? What? Child, getting some s- Okay. You better not say what I think you about to say. Girl. I was gonna say self-care. Yes. Look, let me hook up your hair. Do a little, some, some. No Mika, I don't wanna go to the salon. I'm not ready to be around people yet. Okay, well no worries. Child, I can do it right here. Yes. Now look, I'll do a little wash amd style, nothing major. That's it. Yes. Yes. Come on girl. Look, when you look good, you feel good. Let's just try and see. Okay. Come on bestie.

Girl, lookin' all sexy and glam for your man. Mm-hmm. Thank you, Mika. Thank you so much. Oh, of course. You know I got you. Now look, I really think you need to do what Dr. Brown said. You need to talk to Marcus when he gets home. Yeah, you're right. - Mm-hmm. - You're right. I will. Okay. - I love you. - Girl. - So much. So much. - I love you. Okay, I'll see you later. You can count on it. ♪ The conductor Alright, partner, about to get outta here. I hope you don't plan on driving home. Need me to drop you off? No, I'm good. I'm a, I'm a crash in the back in the sofa and office. - Mm. - Yeah. Look man, I know things are a little bit Rocki at the crib right now, but not going home might not be the best move. Mm. Yeah. I just, I just need some time clear my head. That's what I need to do. Understand. Don't forget to lock up. Oh sure, got it. Alright. Breaking news. An explosion at the diaper station. Fortunately no injuries have been reported. And authorities tell us they do have a suspect waiting- Hey. Hey Rocki, what, what you, what you doing here? I think I left my lipstick here during happy hour. Can you help me find it please? Lipstick? Ain't it a little late for you to be coming back here? Huh, you, you couldn't wait 'til the morning? I was up anyways. I have an early morning flight, so, and I cannot close a deal without my lipstick. Okay, let me see if it's behind here. Thank you. Yeah, I don't know if I left it behind here or... Or somewhere. This it? Yes it is. Thank you. You like it? Yeah, it's nice. Long day? You can say that. What's going on? Everything. Is it the bar? I thought y'all was doing well. Y'all keep a crowd in here and your account is in great standing thanks to me. Yeah, you're right. To be honest, this bar is probably the only thing that's going right in my life right now. When I think about it. Okay. Well, talk to me. I got time. Wow. Shayla, my wife. Oh, you know we lost the baby a couple months ago. She was uh, she was hit by her car. Oh my God. Marcus. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. Well, what happened? Did they find the person that did it? Nope. Just kept driving like nothing. You know, that's had an effect on her. And I understand. October 14th. October 14th we was gonna be parents. But she just act like it was my fault. Like, like, like, like I was supposed to been there to protect her. Marcus. It wasn't your fault. Okay? And your wife is probably just distraught and needs time to deal with everything. I've given her time. I, I've been, I've given her time. But I, I I got needs too. Of course you do. So tell me, what exactly do you need? ♪ Alright, you trying to be somebody ♪ ♪ Why you dressed in all white Will you dance with me? ♪ Might be your lucky guy ♪ Just one night, can't even lie ♪ ♪ You're just my type ♪ Face flawless, body tight ♪ But I can't be Mr. Right or Mr. Right Now. ♪ ♪ Oo, can't be Mr. Right on Mr. Right Now ♪ Marcus? Baby, where are you? Marcus? Uh. So all these late nights at the bar while I'm home waiting for you, this is what you're doing? Baby, of, of course not, baby. Listen, I, I know it looks bad, but I swear nothing happened. Nothing happened? You gonna stand here and lie to me in my face. Like I didn't just see her running outta here half naked. Baby. Listen, I'm not gonna lie. Okay? We kissed, we kissed and that, that's bad. Okay? But that's all that happened. I swear we didn't have sex. You've been cheating on me this whole time. I knew it. I knew it. Baby, I swear to God I haven't cheated on you since we've been married. Okay? Right, because when we first got together you were cheating then too. Look, I, I, I swear, you, please believe me. Before it went any further I told her to leave. I promise. We got three more. We're working. Activate the band. Follow the steps. Ma'am, okay, I know you on a mission. But damn, can you take it down a notch? - Here we go. - Look, I get it. Girl, you in revenge body mode. You're damn right I am. But it's not revenge that's motivating me, it's anger. I still cannot believe I caught Marcus and that girl in his office. And he's still lying about it. Typical. Caught red-handed and he still won't admit to anything. Look girl, he taking that shit to the grave. And he keeps insisting that they didn't have sex. Ha! Like I'm boo boo the fool. Let's talk golf and fitness. Well look, the way you've been working out, girl, he better get his shit together and quick. That body fixin' to be right and tight. Girl, please. We don't even sleep in the same bed anymore. Hell, we barely even talk. We just argue. Down around the bottom of your ankles. Well word on the street, he booed up with some chick. Girl, he don't miss a beat. What chick? Who is she? I don't know. But I can find out though, It's probably that same girl he was in his office with. How do I get a better ability to feel transition? You want me to spy on him? Because you know I will. Oh, just say the word and I will get to it. Look, I'll find out who she is, where she live, her social security number and get her blood type. Girl you know how I do. No, no, I am good, 'cause I remember what happened last time you spied on somebody. Yeah. That was an adventure, girl. Look, but I survived. I just can't believe I was jumping over a gate and she sicked her dog on me. You did follow your man to her house, tried to sneak in her house and got caught. I woulda did the same thing. That was not a game. Okay? I was fighting for my life. Then I slipped on some grass, the damn dog attacked me, biting my shoe. Girl! What kinda dog was it again? A Jack Russell Terrier or some shit. Girl, but then the damn dog peed on me and then old girl had the nerve to call the police on me! Girl about to have me out here with a criminal record. I ain't lying. And here you are volunteering to spy again. Girl you are just nuts. Girl, for you. I'll get mauled by a dog. Aw, thank you for the offer, but... I'm good. For real. I'm just, I'm just really focused on getting myself together. And once you've transitioned, literally rotate your body, bring your arch into the ground. Every time for the last week, this guy's been out here working out and at the same time as you? Girl, he must be checking you out. Who? Cutie over there. Damn, he is fine. Go on, look. Smile back at him, Shayla, go. Feel the ground, rotate, transition and release. Damn. Girl, he is fine. Activate the band. Follow the steps. How you ladies doing? - Rotate. - I'm Jamar. Hi, I'm Tamika and this is my bestie, Shayla. Nice to meet you, Shayla. Likewise. I've never seen you around here before. Do you live out here? Nah, I don't live in the area. I just like it here. You know, being that I am a personal trainer, I like to work out where it's peaceful and quiet. You know, now that I know you work out here, I may have to make it a habit to be here a bit more often. Hmm. Okay. So you said you're a trainer. I've been thinking about getting myself a trainer. Help me, you know, snap back, get fit. Okay, well look from where I'm standing, you look good to me. Thank you, but I'm trying to look better than good. I wanna look great. Okay, well look, you should definitely take my number and uh, maybe I can help you reach that goal. Okay. ♪ Drawn from some power ♪ I've been showered by a different kind of high ♪ ♪ Only love can provide ♪ Baby I Thank you. ♪ Take a toe anytime ♪ Scent of you I find everywhere ♪ ♪ Where, and if I could I would keep you here ♪ ♪ I wouldn't give you Morning Yep. You headed to the gym? I am. It's good to see you keeping busy and you're looking, look good. Toning up. I see it. Thanks. Can we talk? About what? For starters, the bar that night. I mean, you gotta, you gotta believe me when I tell you nothing happened. I believe what I saw, Marcus. And until you stop lying about it and just tell me the truth, I have nothing to say to you. I'm not lying to you. I'm telling you the truth. You just don't wanna listen to me. Like what, you want me to lie and say that I had sex with her? We have nothing at all to talk about. So you can just keep doing whatever the fuck you wanna do with whoever you wanna do it with, okay? Wait, what are you talking about? I'm saying that I know all about the chick you've been running around with. That's what I'm saying. What the fuck are you talking about now? I literally haven't been with anyone. I go to work and I come back here every day. We all know what you do at your office in between that time now, don't we? So why don't you just leave me alone? You keep saying that shit to me, Shayla. You want that to happen because I swear I can make it happen for you. So do it. I don't care. Come on. No, I didn't. Look. I think we need to calm down. Alright, maybe, maybe I should find somewhere to sleep for the next few days. Give us some space. Yeah. Great idea. Hey, chill. Watch out. What's wrong? Shit, I don't know. Fucking head and I can't sleep. My fucking mind all over the place. I hate seeing you stressed out like this. Here's an idea. I have a work trip next week in California, so why don't you come with me? It'll be a nice getaway for the both of us and we can spend some quality time together, finally. Thanks but, no thanks. I mean, I know you mean well, I do. And thank you. I appreciate you for letting me stay here, but this shit is moving a little too fast for me. You know, as we speaking right now, I'm sitting here thinking about my feelings for Shayla, so I cannot go anywhere right now, especially on a out of town trip with you. I thought you said she told you to leave her the hell alone? Yeah. Yep, that's what she said. But we both said a lot of fucked up shit. We're hurt. It's hard losing a baby. Sometimes, sometimes I think both of us don't know whether it's the pain speaking or, or honesty. Look Rocki, I like you. I swear I do. But I just need some time to think about all this shit before I just jump into something else. I understand. I was just tryin' to help. No, no, no, no. Come here. I'm sorry. You have, a lot. I'm, I'm grateful. Hell, if it wasn't for you, I'd literally be camped out in my office on my sofa. But, I think I, I need to find somewhere else to stay until I get my head right. No, please, look, you don't have to do that, okay? Just, you can stay here as long as you want. It's plenty of space. And I will respect whatever boundaries that you have. Raquel, I don't want any mixed signals between us. We're both grown ass people. There's no mixed signals. Okay. Okay. Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. You know, we have crossed boundaries since I've been here. We have, but don't act like I'm the only one who liked it when we did. That's my point exactly. I have too, but... But what? Oh come on, Marcus. You know we vibe and I'm not just talking about on a sexual level either. We make a hell of a business team. Yeah, that's right. Look, I've come up with new ideas for marketing and PR to make Flirt even more successful than it's been. It's lit now, but once you put my plan into play, you'll be able to expand if you want to. For real? Hell yeah. And maybe focusing on business instead of a woman who doesn't even want to talk to you will help clear your head. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. But I still think I need to get my own space. Yeah. Like I gotta, I gotta get to the bar. Thank you for understanding. Hey, I'm just checking in and seeing how everything's going. Oh okay, good. I um, I'm gonna need for you to step it up a little bit. - Hi. - Okay. Damn, those extra sessions are definitely playing off. Thank you. It's my trainer. He's the best. Mm-hmm. These are for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I appreciate you. - No problem. Why don't we go upstairs, make ourselves a little more comfortable. I'd like that. ♪ I'm so lost in this moment ♪ No guilty conscience ♪ You want it, you got it ♪ To the moon, to the stars ♪ Take me far, I'm willing to give it to you ♪ ♪ Long as you just ♪ I'mma let you touch, I'mma let you touch touch ♪ ♪ So baby close the door I thought you left. Without saying goodbye? Hell no. Look, I could never do that to someone as beautiful as you. Oh, you really think I'm beautiful? Damn right. Listen, I know you've been through a lot of shit of these past few months. What your ex did had nothing to do with your looks. You are gorgeous. And that's the first thing I noticed about you at the park. Aw. I'll see you later? Definitely. You're looking lovely today. Things must have gotten better. Thank you. And yes, they have. I met someone new. He is so amazing. He makes me feel beautiful. He compliments me all the time. But it's not that he says it, it's the way he looks at me and he smiles. I know he thinks I'm beautiful. Yes. I'm so happy for you. That must be the best feeling in the world, girl. Mm-hmm. Girl, I know that's right. You better hold onto him. Oh, I am. Plus he is so fine. What she didn't tell y'all was he is super fine. Okay? Shayla, let me ask you this. Are you using this new man as a distraction from the unresolved issues you have with your husband? Well, what does one have to do with the other? Everything. Now it's fine if you wanna move on, if that's what you wanna do, but you can't ignore the feelings you still have for your husband. You're still wearing your wedding ring. You have to be honest with yourself. Are you still in love with Marcus? Shayla, you've benefited from the group therapy, but maybe, maybe it's time for you and Marcus to come in for a private session. Maybe. Um, why would she have to do that? Why can't she just take the ring off? I mean, it's over, right? Shayla, don't listen to her. She just said she moved on. Okay and maybe she hasn't. Okay, look ladies, please. Shayla, you must end your current relationship before moving forward with a new one. Do you understand that? Yes, doc. I understand. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't understand it. Why would you go after a man that clearly has moved on too. But you know what? That's just my opinion. Good luck with your broken ass relationship. There you go, huh? Now back to what you were saying. I was saying this whole thing with Rocki is just getting outta hand, man. I, it's like I don't even know if, if what she wants, if I'm willing to do it or if I'm even capable of giving it to her right now. Look, you should have never stayed over at her crib. I told you that was the wrong move. I know, man. But she said she got a five bedroom, five bedrooms. I get my own personal space. No pressure. I mean, it sounded like a good idea. I guess I didn't think it all the way through though. Which bedroom was you sleeping in? And let me ask you this, are you still in love with Shayla? Come on. Of course I am. Of course. I'm crazy about her, man. I ain't trying to lose my marriage. That's why I gotta get outta Rocki house ASAP. Well, I ain't got five bedrooms, but, I got a couch you can sleep on. It's better than the one you got in the office. You can come anytime. Know what bro? I just might take you up on that offer. Hey. I got this one. I already know what she like. - Hey stranger. - Hey you. Wow. You look good. Well thank ya. You do too. Thank you. Hmm. Oh! For me? The usual, ma'am. Okay. Oo! Okay, now Marcus, your friend keep giving me top-notch service like this he might end up with me on his arm. Well, why you think I'm trying to be so damn impressive? Hmm? Is that all you trying to do? Nah. I'm trying to put a ring on that finger too. Don't play with me. That is something else. Look, Marcus, um, I'm concerned about Shayla. Now look, I know that she's still in love with you, but she keeps denying it. That's the thing I'm still in love with her too. I, I, I'm sure- Uh, hey Marcus. So why you up in this bitch's face? What she just say? What did you just say? No, no, no, no. Hell no. Tamika, I got it. I got it. Hey, what the hell are you doing here? Do I need a reason? I asked you a question. Why are you in this bitch's face? Nuh uh, girl. Who the hell are you calling a bitch? If the shoe fits. Girl. I got it. Let's go. Let's go! What the hell is wrong with you? Bartender! What the hell is wrong with you? Hmm? You know who you are? I'm gonna tell you, you're in my place of business. Now, I don't know why you tripping, and I really don't care. But I'm gonna tell you something else. That shit ain't gonna gonna happen here or anywhere else. I know who that was. That was Shayla's best friend, right? She here trying to get y'all back together? Wait, how you, how do you know who that is? Do you still love Shayla? Is that why you don't wanna take things further with me? You tripping? You're really tripping. Baby. I'm sorry. Damn, Mika left? Yeah, she gone. Yo, I, I gotta get outta here. You, you gonna lock up for me? I got you. Marcus! Right back at her. Girl and I'm meaning that she crazy. Now is... Oh hell no. Marcus. - Listen to me. - Get out. Please listen. Please listen. Okay. I made a mistake, okay? I cannot do this without you. I, I need you. Tamika told me what happened tonight. Really? Do you know what? It, it doesn't even matter because I moved on too. Yeah. Marcus, I'm, I'm done. It's over. - No, it's not. - Please leave. Uh, Marcus, you need to leave. Shay. Girl. - Thank you. - Of course. No one should have to go through that. Hey, it's me. Can you meet me outside? I'm on my way. What's the word, big head. - Hi. - Hi. You okay? Yeah. I just came to see my little brother. Okay. Okay. What's really going on? I'm just going through some stuff. Yeah. Why can't men ever do right? This is about some dude? Yeah, it's about some dude that I actually care about. Oh. Sis don't worry about it. You're gonna meet the right one. Okay? Oh, he is the right one, Jamar. What don't you understand? He's the right one right now. Okay! Look, whatever you say. Anyway, how's things going with you and Shayla from the gym? It's alright. You know, she cool. We, you know, we been vibing. The fuck does that even mean, y'all vibing? Yeah. Like I said, we been vibing, you know, chilling. Wait, so how do you know her again? Through one of my clients. I saw her picture and I thought she was somebody you might be interested in. You know, I'm gonna look out for my little bro bro. And I appreciate that. But look, Raquel, you need to chill out. That last relationship really put you over the top. Look, I'm good. Okay? You just focus on you and making Shayla happy. Look, I gotta go. I got a early day tomorrow, so thanks for the chat. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. Look, you just make sure you text me when you get home, okay? - Uh huh. - Alright. Please leave your message after the tone. Marcus, where are you? I saw you took some of your things from my house. I'm sorry, sweetie. I, look, I just wanna talk to you, okay? And make sure that you're good. That we're good. Look okay, enough is enough. Just can you call me and tell me where you are? Please Marcus, I love you and I promise it won't ever happen again. Your message after the tone. Where the fuck are you, Marcus? Okay, you think you're gonna get away with treating me like this? Well, I promise you're not. I don't think you understand really what you're doing to me at this point. Okay? I, I love you and I need to be with you. I've never loved anybody as much as I love you, Marcus. Please call me. October 14th, we was gonna be parents.

And why would you even want a guy that you know is cheating on you? Like that makes no sense. Oh, don't fucking tell me what makes sense, Jamar! I love him. That's why. And he was falling in love with me too until that baby drama. Now all he can think about is Shayla. What does Shayla have to do with any of this? Oh my God, she's Marcus' ex. Damn, are you stupid? You were a distraction so I could get to Marcus. That's the only reason why I wanted you to get with her in the first place. Damn, Raquel, you are one sick bitch. He's calling. Hey you. I've been calling you. I've been really worried. I'm coming through to pick up the rest of my things. Wait. What? Why? I'm gonna keep it above with you, Rocki. I'm moving back home to be with my wife. No, no. Marcus, you can't do that. Okay? You're making a mistake. I'm sorry. I know this ain't what you're trying to hear, but I love my wife. Look, you don't want her, okay? I wasn't gonna say anything, but she's having sex with somebody else. Hell no. I'm not concerned with anything she's done while I wasn't here. No. No, you can't do this to me, Marcus. Okay, I won't let you. I'm sorry. Rocki, please just understand. This is all your fault! You were supposed to keep his wife away and you couldn't even do that. You need to chill out. Okay. I'm gonna handle this shit myself. Look, Raquel! - Move. - Come on, Raquel. Move, Jamar. - No, stop. - Move. Stop. Move, move. Where's Marcus? Oh. Who, who are you? You know exactly who I am. Don't play stupid. You, you, you're the girl that's slept with Marcus. Let's go. Turn around. Let's go. Why are you doing this? You need to listen to me. Stop interfering in me and Marcus' relationship. You put him through some serious changes and he absolutely deserves better than that. And then you claim you love him so much, yet you're having sex with another man. Like, make it make sense. He deserves to be with me, a woman who can actually help build his empire. Not a depressed ass housewife. You need to go. No, please, please. You don't wanna do this. Don't tell me what the fuck I wanna do. Damn, I wish your whiny ass would've died with your baby a few months ago. What did you just say? Yeah, I'm the one who hit you with my car when you were out jogging. Did you get my gift? I had a lot of fun picking out the baby clothes. What the hell is wrong with you? What kind of monster are you? Me? What about you? You don't one that left Marcus out to dry when he needed you the most. I was there for him when you weren't. And who's he with now? Hmm? What the hell is going on? Hey, yo, my man. You all right? You good? We gotta stop her. Stop who? Raquel man, she my sister. Look, you must be Marcus, man. She going after Shayla. What, you mean Rocki? Yes. And she got a gun. Come on, man. Hey Shayla. Hey. Hold on, hold up. Just stay right here. Wait right here. Hey, baby. Look who it is, Shayla. Hey baby. Why don't you go sit down next to your wife? Rocki, you gotta- Just sit down, Marcus. You know, all of you men are the same. You never appreciate a good woman, just like my ex. All I wanted to do was love you and help you build an empire. But you can't even see that. No, Raquel, he appreciates everything that you've done for him. He's told me. No, he doesn't. He doesn't appreciate anything that I've done for him. He does. I swear. He, he told me that it's because of you that Flirt is doing so well. It's all because of you. It is. It really, it really is, Rocki. Then why don't you want me? Because he's married. He deserves me, not you. Hey, Rocki, look, stop. This has nothing to do with Shayla. This is between me and you. Just let her go. Let her go. No. Jamar? You psycho! You hit me and you killed my baby. Wait What? Wait, you killed our baby. It was the perfect opportunity when I saw her. She doesn't deserve you, Marcus. She's depressed. She doesn't have a job. Babe, you deserve a go-getter. You need to be with me. She kicked you out. Don't you remember? No, don't, don't do it baby. Don't do it. She's not worth it. She's already going to jail for shooting Jamar. Please. I knew your ass was soft. A real woman woulda let him kill me. Jamar, Jamar. You okay? 911, what is your emergency? Yes, ya'll need to send someone to 219 South Butterfield Street. - Someone's hurt? - Yeah, someone has been shot. We're getting help started that way, okay? Alright, thank you. Just, hold on, hold on. Hey, you know I'm actually, I'm glad we went to go see Dr. Brown. She's cool. Made me wish she would've went to a couple's therapy sooner. Yeah. We really should have went after losing the baby. Yeah. But the important thing is we're going now and our marriage is stronger than ever. It is. I told you I was gonna fight for us. You believe me now, baby? Yes, Marcus. I believe you. I'm gonna go get something to drink. No, no. You chill out. For as much I put you through, I will wait on you hand and feet. Boy, stop playing fool. I'm a fool for you. I'm gonna go get you something to drink though. Okay. It's my turn to pick the movie. Hey, don't pick no corny ass movie. Uh Marcus, your phone is ringing. Answer it for me please. It's probably Swiss. Are you sure you want me to answer your phone? No more secrets, remember. Hello. This is a prepaid call from an inmate at the County Correctional Facility. To decline this call, press nine now. And to accept this call, press one now. Your call has been accepted. Hello? Who is this? Put Marcus on the phone. Raquel, what do you want? I wanna share the good news. What good news? Well, I wanted him to be the first to know, but since you asked, I beat you to it.
