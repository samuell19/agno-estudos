Ryan? Are you behind us? - Negative, man. - What? What's happening? Our truck stalled three times since we left camp. For fuck's sake. I don't feel good about this. This isn't going to end well. We just got to the drop off point. You okay? Thank God the truck's getting fixed. Glad to hear it. Told you not to worry too much. Besides, you've got your lucky charm with you. Your lucky charm. The toy soldier your son gave you. Of course, buddy. It's here in my pocket. Then you're all good. - See you tomorrow, then? - All right. Be careful. Kams. Astro. Kams, you're with Lozano. Astro, you're with me. Remember, boys, we're not in their territory yet but that doesn't mean we're safe. No other point of entry? There wasn't any. The area was filled with armed men. Our boys can only move in the cover of darkness while the enemy is asleep. Their last and biggest challenge... was to cross a wide river. Water that was neck-deep with a hide tide current. Raymund Train? - At around 3:45 in the morning... - So, Franco? - Are we in Pidsandawan? - ...only 13 had crossed the river. Not even half. The roosters will start crowing any time now. Yes, sir. We're almost there. Only half a kilometer to his hut, right? We can smell them from here. That bastard Marwan. I've been hunting him for five years. I've been tailing him for three months, sir. You know the way, Franco? Yes, sir. I've memorized the video. The video from your asset was taken during daytime. It's still dark. It won't be accurate. Don't worry, sir. We have night vision. Boys, clean up your night vision goggles. ...where were the SAF's support team? Add in the river crossing, they could be two hours away on foot. Lozana! They're finally firing at Marwan. It's about damn time. Seaborne's two hours behind. It's Usman! We should have passed through Pidsandawan by now. We're in a dangerous spot. I wonder how the 45th, 42nd, and 41st are doing. Have they caught up behind us? Boss, we're in a rough spot. What's the news? How are the fish? The fishies are still swimming. Two of us were wounded. Over. Usman got away. Sir. He has so many cellphones. Seven. For calling his contacts from ISIS and Jemaah Islamiyah and for detonating bombs. Our hard work paid off. By the way, sir. It's almost 5:00 a.m. Muslims have started praying. Right. And don't forget, boys. There's a rebel camp just 500 meters away from here. So move it. Get going. Double time, boys. - Hang on. - Wrap it up. We can't drag his body with us. It will slow us down. Sir, what are you gonna do? Will you cut him up? I'll cut a finger off. Fuck you. Let's respect the dead. ...what was going through your head, Director Nape単as? That it's the end for me, Mistah. I'll repeat my question, what was going through your head after the Seaborne killed Marwan? If the operation had ended there, then mission accomplished. I've hunted Marwan for five years. But his accomplice got away. Usman. Isn't that right? Usman isn't as important. It just so happens that the US government placed a higher bounty on Marwan's head. Five million dollars for Marwan. One million dollars for Usman. Is $1 million a small amount to you? ...but we've rattled Usman. It'll be easier to take him down in the future. ...when I was still a deputy director... So we knew he wouldn't let us take him alive. Unfortunately, on their way out of his rathole, that's when things went sideways. We all saw the body bags on TV. But what I'd like to know from you... Why were there so many casualties? Congrats to all of us. But stay on your toes, okay? We still need to get out of here. Stop! Stop, don't fight back, all right? Sir Pabalinas, what do we do with him? Tie up both of his hands. - Put a gag in his mouth. - Got it, sir. Cempron, we're in a vulnerable position. You're right. And the locals are waking up. I'm sure there are others with him. Lalan! Cempron! Go back across the bridge. Secure the place so when the Seaborne get here, they'll be safe. Okay, sir. Soldiers. Soldiers. Soldiers. Soldiers. Sir, there are people on the other side. How many? Just two, I think. They thought we were soldiers. Were they armed? I didn't notice. Might be civilians. They didn't fire at us. You're right. There's two of them. Looks like they're unarmed. - Let's stand guard for now. - Yes, sir. Wear your night vision goggles! Let them guess where we are. Shit! Of course. I know that there's a ceasefire... Problem is, the rebels don't care if it's a police operation. Police or military, both are armed and wearing fatigue. Did you inform the military about Oplan Exodus beforehand? SAF were only informed when they reached the target area. Here's the thing. ...there's always missing intel. That's why Marwan keeps getting away. So is it true that Interior Secretary Mar Roxas... ...PNP OIC Leonardo Espina were not aware of this? That is correct. I know, but that wasn't my decision. If that's the case, who has? Hey, Alan. I'm having a fantastic morning. My pulse is regular. I hope you have good news for me. I knew it. You're here to ruin my day. Is this about Oplan Exodus? What happened? The operation has been aborted, sir. The SAF boat sunk. How many operations have you had against Marwan? Eight, sir. Aren't you the elite Seaborne who trained with the Navy SEALs? What happened to that? Alan. We've shared a long and close friendship, that's why I gave this to you. You're suspended, right? I shouldn't even be giving this to you. That's why you need to deliver. - Leo. - Sir. We've struck out nine times. I thought you had that last one in the bag because our boys got rubber boats? Our troops encountered some difficulties and were forced to abort. Do you know that you're losing your president's favor? Our intel's been compromised, sir. Our Commander-in-Chief's losing respect for me. You should feel ashamed too. Come off it. You're sure SAF can handle this? Sir, we've identified Marwan's new location. Our assets have the area on video. The terrain's challenging, but boats are not needed this time, sir. We've got the terrain leading to the target area all mapped out. Are you sure? Don't forget, this will be our 10th operation. And quite possibly our last chance. Absolutely nothing should go wrong. You know I'm supposed to be suspended. Sir. This time, our intel is more solid and credible. And we've studied the mission down to a T. What do we name the operation? Oplan Exodus, sir. Yeah. Talk later. Let's go! Ma'am, we're sorry. The BOI session is off-limits. Sir, who is General Magalong interviewing? Is it General Nape単as? That's confidential, ma'am. Then how did I know? Then why are you asking us, ma'am? You're a funny guy, sir. I'll remember you. Sure, but please clear the way. We don't want to get in trouble. We were rushing for nothing. You accompanied Senior Superintendent Mendez and PDG Purisima to Malaca単ang to present the details of Oplan Exodus to the president. What did the president say? He wanted coordination with the AFP. He was bothered that we didn't include the military in our plans. I explained to him that there should be no leakage in intel for the operation to be successful. He agreed with me. Did he really? He didn't insist on his wish for you to coordinate with the AFP? He was silent about it. He simply told me to call in more forces. And then? Then he spoke privately with PDG Purisima and Senior Superintendent Mendez and I left the room. PDG Purisima approached me. He told me something important. He told me not to inform Secretary Mar Roxas about the operation. He said that? And Spine too. He's not our Mistah, but we know him well. Same batch as PDG Purisima. PDG Purisima also told me that he would take care of AFP Chief General Catapang. Usman passed through here. There's a trail at the back. We can still catch them. That's not the mission, Franco. We need to meet back up with 55th. It's so hot. Are we still not allowed in? No one's allowed in yet. Sure, I know you. So there's nothing going on yet? There is. Just behind closed doors. I'll just text General Magalong. He'll run out of luck at the Senate Hearing. The Senate is tough. Miriam will eat him alive. Remember, we only have one month to complete our report. Well, we already sent an invitation to Malaca単ang... That's his prerogative if he doesn't want to explain. What if he still won't budge, sir? ...and give us a record of his text conversations with the president. Miriam and Enrile will roast him. Down to the bones. Circle 'round back. The media's out front. Mary Ann, how did you get in? I have my ways, sir. Investigations have just started. We still have a lot to do. Okay. Come with me. Thank you, sir. Gladys. We've been waiting but it's okay, you have a cozy office. Do I? Sir, our questions are ready. Can we do the interview now? Listen. I only have five minutes for both of you. I'll give you each three questions but I'm telling you now... ...because the details of our investigation are still confidential. I'll go first because we're all set up. Benny? Roll the camera. Sir, why do you think you were chosen to head the BOI? As you know, I was a former SAF director. I'm currently the CIDG chief so it's not a stretch to think that I can do the job. We got some great coverage. Pretty, right? That's breaking news. So conceited. Trying to one-up us. Where's our ride? I don't know. It's in the parking lot. - The van! - You haven't called yet? - Should I? - You're the producer... Am I the driver too? - Don't answer back. - Sorry. Calling him now. Your eyes are always wandering. Look. The Senate conducts its own inquiry. So will the House of Representatives. So what's the point of the BOI? Let them have at it. Theirs are just for show. The BOI is ours. I doubt very much that we can force the AFP to cooperate with us. Considering there's different versions of what really happened in Mamasapano. Let's not force them if they don't want to. All I'm saying, Benjie, is that... But Spine is the Officer in Charge. Don't you have any plans to promote him to full chief status? Why tell me now? Is everyone here, Franco? We're running out of time. Do we have news yet? Where's the 55th? Are they moving on? Still no update, sir. Maybe they're at the drop off point. Son of a bitch! It's almost sunrise! Yes, Mike. Why are you calling? Sorry if I woke you up, sir. No, but I haven't had my coffee. Isn't this a little early? Call up Sir Nap! Tell him the Seaborne are engaged in a fire fight. Sir, Irania of the 55th. Here, sir. Sir, the Seaborne have been engaged. We can hear the gunshots. I see. Are you near their location? Maybe about two kilometers. Where are you now? We're still in the cornfield, sir. We're at waypoint 11 and 12. Why haven't you left that spot? The locals are out and about, sir, and we're standing guard for the Seaborne. They've got eyes on us. There was only six of them, but more are coming. Are they armed? Civilians, sir, but it looks suspicious. Hostiles across the river! This is our land! You're not getting out alive! You're not getting out alive! This is our land! We'll run you down! Shit, why isn't it working? - Call them! Call them! - Yes, sir! Go home! We're pinned down in the cornfields. Hold your position. Back-up's on their way. Don't let them scare you! Put holes in them! Tayrus. Irania from 55th is your best friend, right? Yes, sir. We grew up in Zamboanga del Sur. Zamboanga. Same as you, right, Villanueva? Yes, sir, but we're from San Pablo. Irania and I are from Dumalinao. They're so close that people mistake them for a couple. Get out of here. Am I wrong? Reniedo. - Sir. - What are you doing? Please respect the dead. He's still a human being. Where's that coming from? Sir, that's the 55th's position. At the cornfield beside the bridge. They couldn't get to us. Shit, looks like they're trapped. Got a text from Irania. Five of them are dead. Must be why Pabalinas isn't answering his phone. Sir, weren't you on the phone with him while we were on the highway? Yeah. Their truck got stalled three times. Pabalinas said this is the first time he's nervous. We're lucky though. - Marwan's dead. Mission accomplished. - Agreed, sir. That's where you're wrong. That was earlier. Things are different now. We've disturbed all of Mamasapano. Sir, all the enemies are up. 55th's in a bad spot. What's your location? Sir, we're still at the highway. What? Why aren't you behind the 55th? We're trapped. They've got snipers. You can't go forward? It's too dangerous, sir. Where the fuck are your snipers? They are too many. We're against the sunlight. You gave us a start. Sorry about this, Colonel. We've killed Marwan. - Congratulations, General Tali単o. - Thank you. But we didn't expect them to be held up on their way out of the target area. Colonel, we need your help for the extraction. I already informed my boss. What did General Pangilinan say? He's just concerned how this affects the ongoing peace process. I'm counting on that. Thank you. Looks like you have no issues with lack of prior coordination. The AFP and PNP are not enemies. - Kams, you okay? - Buddy, are you okay? You got shot. I thought that took you all out. Thought so too, sir. It's not our time yet. Yeah, but I'm going deaf. Move over here to the left. There's more cover. You good, boys? Yes, sir! - Okay, let's go! - Move! - Can you get up? - Yes, yes. Reniedo, tell the rest to catch up. Let's lie low for now! Motherfucker! Where are the reinforcements? I've been texting Sir Naps nonstop. He keeps saying they're on their way! When are they coming? Tomorrow? When we're nothing but corpses? Calm down, Cempron! We're still alive. Keep fighting! Good news, boys. Message from Command. From Sir Naps, sir? From Senior Inspector Espe. Lyndon, sir? What did he say? The joint peace panel's talking with Commander Guma of the MILF. Tabdi! Finally. Thank you! I heard there are now 11 SAF casualties in Mindanao. Are the numbers confirmed? I don't know yet. ...through Brgy. Tuka. It is not that easy. So, did you fix our radio yet? But it's okay, I already texted our grid coordinates to Command. Did you request for reinforcements? Three times, sir. Sir, Reniedo's getting paler and paler. He's not in good shape. I hope reinforcements arrive soon. Yeah, he needs to be rushed to the hospital. Fuck! What the fuck, I thought there was a ceasefire command! Franco! Franco, what are you doing? Franco, where are you going? Franco, you bastard, come back here! Franco, come back here! Son of a bitch! Franco! Franco, you bastard, come back here! Nacino, go with him. Let's lie low here for now. Rest while you can. Get some rest. Franco. Come here. I need a word. What the fuck were you doing earlier? - Nothing, sir. - The fuck you mean? Have you gone fucking crazy? You really think the reinforcements are coming? I feel like we're all going to die here. You pull another stunt like that again, I'll strip you of your rank. - How's it going, Reniedo? - Sir. - You good? How are you? - I'll pull through. I'll pull through. Don't worry. Our reinforcements are on their way. They'll come. Okay, sir. I'll keep hanging on. Just don't leave me behind. No one's getting left behind. We're brothers. Okay? - Sir Train? - Villanueva. Do you think we're getting out of here alive? Yeah. Have we had a casualty? No, we don't have casualties. You see, I promised my wife, Yvette, and my daughter that I'd come home safely to them. There you go. - You made a promise, right? - Yes, sir. Don't break it. Tabdi received a text earlier. The 55th already lost 11 men. - Eleven, sir? - Eleven. That was hours ago. The number's probably gone up. We wouldn't know. Medic! Cempron got shot! Medic! Is there a medic out here? Fuck. What are our chances against them? From morning to noon, what were you doing at the Tactical Command Post while the 55th were dropping like flies? Mistah, what do you think we were doing? Staring into space? Playing Mobile Legends? ...the artillery support the army promised us. And we heard about the ceasefire negotiations. We were counting on that. What happened to the SAF reinforcements? Since 55th couldn't move, the rest of the blocking forces couldn't forward. And you had an additional 300 SAF troopers in Maharlika Highway... They promised they would help but by noon, they gave us nothing! So I thought, "What is going on here?" He told us you spoke with General Catapang. He told me that the AFP would be sending artillery and air support. But I got that text from him in the morning. He was in Zamboanga at the time. Having photo ops. The helicopter was waiting to take him to Maguindanao. Then things turned to shit in Mamasapano. No. He only texted PDG Purisima. The president was with General Catapang in Zamboanga. So I assume he already told him about the situation in Mamasapano. What do you think the Commander-in-Chief told the Chief of the AFP? Mistah, God knows I did everything to save my men. But there are things beyond my control. You bastards! No one's coming to save us! There are no reinforcements! There's no ceasefire! We're all going to die here! We're going to get buried alive! We'll be buried in this cornfield! That was at two in the afternoon. We had been in a fire fight for more than eight hours. That's when I knew that we were going to die in that cornfield. And that I had to do something if I was to get out alive and see my family again. Cempron. Advance! Advance! Lalan! Find a way to get out! At least one of us should make it out! What are we going to do, sir? Hide in the river! Sir, I need to take off my vest to go under water. - Who's going to cover me? - I will. No, Meo. Buddy, I'm almost out of bullets. My wound is really bad. I feel faint. This is where I'm going to die. No! Tell my family what happened here. How this day went down. - You're not gonna die here! - You should move. Let's just wait for a break. As soon as I get up, make a run for it! Move it! Help him. Help him! Go! You sons of bitches! We're all going to die! You bastards! Keep firing! Don't stop! Shoot all of them! We'll bury you here! You're not going nowhere! I hid among the water lilies for 11 hours. I waited until they retrieved all the bodies from the cornfield. That morning they told us the military was coming in to help us. They promised a tank, artillery, helicopter from the Air Force. We waited for so long. Someone got shot! - I got shot! - Medic! Cordero! Fuck! Cordero! Cordero! Fuck! You bastards! Cordero! Cordero! Fuck! Cordero! You bastards! Fuck you! Come at me! It's okay now. They say it was 4:00 p.m. when total ceasefire became official. If that's true, then why did Ged Tabdi have to die at 5:00 p.m. from a bullet wound through his head? ...who laid down their arms by 4 o'clock. Finally, the support that the AFP promised appeared in the sky. It was just a dummy explosive. Just sound and light. No fatal explosions. And just like that, the enemies ran away. Sir. If that was all it took to save our men, why did we have to wait for a whole day? If it had come in the morning, then... maybe Nacino would still be alive. Villanueva, Tabdi, Tayrus, Cordero, Reniedo... Sir. What happens if this investigation leads directly to the president? Aren't you a strong contender for PNP Chief? What's your plan? What's your plan? Sir, it's this way to the cornfield. Do you think we'll survive here? - Where's our reinforcements? - When we're nothing but dead? I made a promise to my wife and daughter that I'd come home safely to them. - We're all going to die here! - The reinforcements aren't coming! There's no ceasefire! Love you and baby very much. We'll die here. They're going to bury us alive! I feel faint. This is where I'll die. - I'll love you even in the afterlife. - Tell my family about what happened. - No one's coming to save us! - Daddy, I'll wait for your return. Well, we had to assess the terrain to know what challenges the SAF commandos had to face while on their mission. 35 of the fallen 44 died exactly where we're standing now. But we'll also speak with individuals involved while we're here in Maguindanao. Could you tell us the names of the people to be interviewed by the BOI? You ask questions like Mary Ann. Looks like there's a network ceasefire. Sir, will you visit Marwan's hideout? I'm sorry. That's impossible because per our intel, Marwan's hut has been burned down. Do you have any leads on who might have done this? I was surprised to see him. He was naked and muddy all over. He only had fatigue pants on. He was a bit skinny and not that tall. At that time, the government officers must have finished retrieving the bodies of the SAF. Most of the MILF had gone back to their homes. When I saw him, I thought he was one of the MILF. He went to the mosque. He must have thought it was an ordinary house. It's a mosque. I had four others with me inside resting after their prayers. He shot at them while they were sleeping. How do you know they were sleeping? I was just in there. I was praying before I took a shower. But hold on, you said you escaped when Lalan chased after you. Yes, ma'am. Then you couldn't have seen them sleeping. I heard the gunshots. Sir, are the rumors true? - What is it? - That the MILF will sue me for war crimes. Well, they're saying that the four MILF were sleeping when you shot at them. They weren't, sir! They were firing at me too. Well, for now, we don't know if they'll charge you. Not so tough now. - Sir. - Thank you. Why are you still here in Maguindanao? Looks like you don't want to see your family anymore. I'm still looking after some friends at the hospital. I have two guides under my care, if you remember. Kams was killed in action. He was shot in the head. Astro has a fatal wound, so I can't leave him in the hospital until he gets better. I owe him that much. So what's your plan? We heard a lot of SAF men from your company are planning to quit. I understand why they wouldn't want to risk their lives. Again. They've served their country. What about you, Franco? I can't blame them, sir. I get where they're coming from. As for me, I love my job. Besides, I promised Sir Train I wouldn't leave the SAF. I remember when he left the house, I said, "Daddy, you should stay behind because you're not well enough yet." He replied, "Darling, you don't understand." "Daddy, please don't go. The bad guys might get you." What I don't understand is why Captain Pabalinas chose to position the 55th company in that cornfield. He still had an hour before the enemy trapped them. It's basic stuff. You need to secure the perimeter before establishing the position. He should have noticed that only 500 meters away behind the cornfield, there were tall coconut trees better suited for a defensive position. If Pabalinas had done this, they would not have been massacred. ...we all know that hindsight is 20/20. It's easy for us to say that Captain Pabalinas should have done that strategy. But as one of those in that battlefield, sir, I understand why Pabalinas was not able to foresee that the 55th would be trapped like they did. There's a lot to consider in these operations. ...many people had many shortcomings in what happened in Mamasapano. If you think about it, sir, there's plenty of blame to go around. We should point fingers at each other rather than lay blame on the dead men who gave up their lives. SP04 Bill Fernando Jumalon. Mr. President, why are you blaming us, the SAF? We're the ones in the shitstorm, we're the ones who lost our brothers, and yet it's our fault? Now, wait a minute. You asked for a bull session with your Commander-in-Chief. But you complain to me when I say something you don't like? The problem is, you left us there to die. You spent the whole day in Zamboanga while we were out there dropping down like flies in Mamasapano. You didn't do anything to help us. You don't know what you're saying. Let me ask you this. When did you ever say that you blame the rebels? When? You let us get wiped out because your peace process was more important to you. SP04 Jumalon? That's okay. I've said all I wanted to say. Anybody else have a question for the president? Mr. President, I am SP01 Allan Franco. I won't ask questions but I'd like to share a wonderful project by the Department of Education. We received so many letters from young students. It warms my heart to read the letters expressing gratitude for our service to the people. Mr. President, if I were to be asked again if I am prepared to take on a mission as dangerous as Mamasapano, I would answer you with a resounding "yes!' And I'm very confident that my colleagues would answer the same. Because while there are innocent children who believe in our sacrifice for the country, I'm ready to offer up my life to serve my beloved Philippines. Thank you, Mr. President. That's all. How are you, Mistah? Not so bad. You heard my successor say his pledge. I really hope so, Mistah. I'm happy for you. You have no idea. My career's in danger too. I was pulled into this mess. - Mistah, is the BOI report ready? - Yes. It's ready for printing. We were supposed to submit it to Talis on Monday. What can I do for you? Benjie, I think you know why we're here. Is this about our Commander-in-Chief? This is all Alan's fault. That's right. He took advantage of his friendship with the president. So you're saying that PNoy allowed himself to be manipulated. He is too loyal, that's why he got tangled up in this mess. Mistah... Be direct with me. I know a little bird whispered in your ear to come and convince me. I appreciate that you came in person. We're here for the sake of your future. I know. Thank you. Bottom line is, if you decide to release the BOI report, you can forget about being PNP Chief. After the PNP Board of Inquiry released the results of their investigation into the Mamasapano encounter, President Noynoy Aquino summoned BOI Chief Police Director Benjamin Magalong to Malaca単ang yesterday. According to Magalong, the president is dismayed by the findings of the BOI report which says that the president is largely responsible for the bloody encounter in Maguindanao that killed 44 commandos of the Special Action Force. Magalong said that he and the president discussed how he bypassed the chain of command when he independently planned the mission in Mamasapano along with the suspended PNP Chief Director General Alan Purisima and previously fired SAF Director Getulio Nape単as. If only that were possible, sir. I swear there was an order. As early as 7:00 a.m., he knew that the SAF were sitting ducks. But what did he do? He carried on with his goddamned picture-taking in Zamboanga. As if there wasn't a battle going on 500 kilometers away. Before lunch, General Guerrero asked him what the military could do to save those men. Obviously, he didn't know what to do. What was he thinking? That he's playing Call of Duty? At around 2:00 p.m., General Guerrero approached him again... But what did he do? He dilly-dallied. We all know that no order means a stand down. President Noynoy Aquino instated Police Director Ricardo Marquez as the new Chief of Philippine National Police. Marquez faces the challenge of the still unresolved investigation into the gruesome massacre of the SAF 44 in Mamasapano, Maguindanao and the serious damage it has inflicted against PNP leadership. He will also take charge of the preparations for the security of the next presidential election in 2016.
