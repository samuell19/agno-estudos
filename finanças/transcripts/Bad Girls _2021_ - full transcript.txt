Thank heaven for little girls. Shit. And this is our girl. Now this poor son of a bitch reeks of pussy and gunpowder. Of course it's our girl girl. Her little girl. Of another side. We're going the wrong way. I got a regular slot. Yes. Yes. Now, let's see. OK. Never better. I'm too fucked up to know for sure. They worked in harsh numbers. So we'll call that OK. Ain't over, but looks like we're going to have to put it for a while. Kenny, I have to get back to my dorm, I have a test in the morning, so do I. Sex that final? Kenny, I'm being serious. Don't be an asshole about this, please. You kissed me and shut me down, and I'm the asshole. Well, I'm not the one who wanted to go park. Well, am I supposed to do with this? I don't care what you do with it, but keep it away from me. Sometimes I really don't get you, Kelly. Look after finals are over. We can go back to that cute little motel by the beach and you can have your way with me. Yeah, yeah. You said that last time and you spent the entire weekend puking on everything and you shouldn't have gotten me drunk. You got yourself drunk. You didn't need any help from me. Well, I don't remember you having a problem with it at the time. I'm amazed you remember anything at all. Was I supposed to get all hot and bothered at the sight of you curling strawberry daiquiris everywhere and stumbling around the room like a retard? The R-word, Kenny? Sorry to bother you, lovebirds, but my girls and I have run into a bit of car trouble. Nice hot rod, thanks to 1960 past talking about the car carrying Elizabeth. You're not going anywhere. What is this, what gives you here that girls Romeo here wants to know what gifts he's about to find out the hard way. Who are you? What do you want? You are lucky you came along. We did honey. Look like Casanova. Here we're going to take no for an answer. None of your business. I make it my business. Now the car hot. Let's calm down. We'll do what you say. That's for sure. It's our lucky day care policy. That's a nice sweater. Take it off. Why do you have a hearing problem, Tinkerbell? She said. Take it off. You have no right. Might makes right. And we've got all the rights now. That's why we just do it. They say they've got a gun. Yeah, Kelly, we've got a gun choirboy who's a smart fella. Nothing but make up tampons and plastic. No greens. Danny Fresh, you know, I don't use Downey, it's Chanel. Aren't you a peach? Everybody just calm down. Please stop with the waterworks before you draw yourself. Please just take the car and go, Look for you wonder. We take whatever we want whenever we want. Heroin duffel bag. first things first. Loverboy here for a ride, this is what time. But what the fuck? The way she's raising my voice, I was asking for it. Back. That totally killed the mood. I could have seen that coming. Joyce Poindexter here and let's get moving. Didn't even get to take my ride. Oh God, no. Sorry. You heard the lady. Q, couple. Party isn't over, is it? No way. Just a hiccup. But we do need food, fuel and ammo. There's this place I've heard about on the edge of town where we happen to be headed. Not sure if I believe it even exists, but if it does, and it's even half as batshit as I've heard. We're in for some fun. UN fucking believable. UN fucking believable. Look at these camel jockey sons of bitches. So you don't hate me, baby killing fuckers. You sons of bitches, you tell. Good evening, ladies, and welcome to Windows Cafe, the only 24 hour donut coffee and convenience shop this side of the county line. May I suggest the bagels, the fresh? You can keep the cream puffs, pal. We're here for the firepower. Excuse me what the firepower is. What you said heard right pops. You're trying to purchase firearms. We're only legally allowed to sell ammunition and I'm not sure I can even sell you that you look like you're still driving with your learner's permit. Don't let the kid looks for you, Mr. Donut. You've got guns and we want them simple math. You girls don't need guns. Maybe we think we do. Yeah, maybe we're out necking in our car and some robbers roll up on us. We have to be able to protect ourselves. All right, look, be good little girls and go home. Daddy's probably going to read you a bedtime story complete with cookies and milk. Don't count on it. What would girls like you need with a gun anyway? It's none of your concern, Barney. It's a free country with the right to privacy and a right to bear arms. Sign says cash only. We've got the cash and we want to buy some guns. For one thing, the name is Wendell Barney. Ma'am, your reasoning taking into consideration your request fully evaluated and your answer. Out of the question, what do you mean out of the. Knock it off, Missy. I told you both to let me do the talking. Listen, honey, I'm an independent businessman, an American citizen, a veteran of foreign wars. I pay my goddamn taxes and I got a sign out front. It says I'm the proprietor of this establishment and I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. Especially Big Mouth, Tramps running around and Hollywood hooker outfits looking for Trump. Hold on a minute, so you hold on. I didn't come back from Desert Storm. Can my buddy home in a cardboard box? Tobin, a 24 hour donut and ammo shop to take leave of companies like. Ready. Goddamn, Jeff. And you have now crossed a fucking line. Final warning, Captain Fuckface. We're not leaving until we get what we want. Please, for your information, I've been a wreck. I spent my youth in the Desert Storm. I've survived three IED detonations, improvised explosive devices. So if you think I'm shaking in my boots over here because a little hard body high school dropout with an attitude is pointing a gun at me, you've got another thing coming. And let me tell you something else I didn't bring my buddy's body parts home and a cardboard fucking box. So they threw. You even heard of Desert Storm. We didn't come here for a history lesson, full metal jack off. Now drop the shotgun before I drop you. I got the high ground missy. Now go on. Oh. Busy grabs cash. Carolyn Chambers, you can carry like the chocolate chip. It's got to have cost around. Ma'am, we got the bastard that killed your baby. Let's see. What a mess. It's got to be, there are one eyewitness says that the dead guy inside murdered the baby and then the three girls attacked him after that. You're not suggesting that these three torch are heroes, and we don't even know if this is the same girl. And honestly, probably doing the ward a favor this one. He's on several watch lists hours. He's one bad days donor receipt away from blowing up a federal building. I'll stake my badge on this being a robbery turned homicide and the work of our three little angels 50 to one. All right. You know, back in. We heard the last of these, the. We'll get a positive I.D. soon, agents, we have security footage. Yup. That's a positive match with the cam footage from a strip club that same girls. All right. You know what really flips my chitlin switch? McMurphy, the flagrante say that how they just prance around like the world owes them fucking everything. All right. Look, I understand they're a little brazen, but not any more than any other criminal gang around here. And I guarantee nobody's going to miss these victims bullshit shit. Look, don't blow a Fuze, can it? We'll find them. We're going to find them. Fuck em. Try them and forget them figuratively. Managed to keep my eyes on the road. We need to keep moving. We can't be far from the border now. Hey, Carolyn, how does a drink sound? Peachy next shithole, we see. Bartender, where's my fucking whiskey, man? Oh, fuck fuckin time, you're back, they're going to call yourself. Fuck you, look at it. Keep the change. Yeah, I know there is no change, but keep it anyway, I. What is this, a fucking fag bar? Where's the pussy action around here? three tequila shots for hot. You girls know they don't serve mine is here, oh. You were a baby sitter. It's not like I'm going to turn you in. Things are finally looking up around here. OK, I want to talk to you. We're in a rush, dad. We're just here to refuel and white line it back out of here. You want a white line? Well, get out your keys. We can have a private meeting in the bathroom. Sounds like a real fun time, but we'll pass. We got off to a bad start. You are you, ladies. Get names. Yeah. Snap, crackle and pop. We are cute. I would have pegged you for a destiny. You for candy. And you for a Lexus. Speak Alexis. Out front. You girls want to go for a. Right here on to where the emergency room or the cemetery. What's that supposed to mean? I know it's cryptic, but you'll figure it out eventually. Fresh baby lamb chops moss after a rain citrus. What? The three flavors of a woman. At this guy holds a county record for restraining orders. I like your style mouthy. But when God damn sexy, fucking bitch, I don't know how to thank you. So I won't. You don't have to thank me. I call it like I see it women like a man who calls the shots. Do we now? That's right, baby. We went on. He's got ambition. I don't think I can. Fuck you sideways, you've done good. This is funny to you. I like you're at it. This guy is a constant pain in my ass. He's running off business. Unfortunately, we're pretty bad for business to empty out the register. Hey, it's cool. I just work here. Don't shoot. Don't shoot him. He's cute. And get the money. Keep this for yourself. Full stop. Christmas, too. This is happening right now. It's her favorite bath or gains, where it is a living wet dream girls. Remember when we first met and we made a pact that we're going to take our due hell or high water, no matter what? Yeah, well. Money, drugs, weapons, it's all penny ante shit. This this is love, love is for suckers bullshit. We're going to find this clip, Mildura. It's a 40 400 Lincoln Street. I told you to ditch your phone. This is how they track people down. I told you. OK. Let's go. I'm ready to meet near rock star. Now your shoulder, it's a mosquito bite. Let's go. Well, you still don't know the identity of the suspects who have set social media ablaze, with some even hailing them as heroes. Girl, they're just like Bonnie and Clyde, but they are all burning and there's three of them. Sex workers are always being taken advantage of. It's about time they started fighting back. Seems to me whoever got killed deserved it. Police still don't. Looks like we got a face match. 99% probability we found. Washington Mitzi Chandler. Carolyn Hill. We got you, bitches now. We got nothing. Those girls are probably already across the border by the time we got finished doing a crime scene. Whose side are you on here, McMurphy? You know whose side are more crazy? I'm just saying those girls are pros, and I have a hunch you'll find that in the rap sheet and ain't no pros going to sit around waiting to get caught while we mess with procedure. Oh, I definitely know what they're doing. I'll give you that. Sooner or later, they're going to fuck up. I know women like this. Sure. Hope you're right, dick. And no women like this. Well, this is a bad idea. There's going to be hundreds of people in there, hundreds of scurrying roaches when we come in guns blazing. Carolyn, let's have some firepower. I'm just saying we've got a shitload of money in drugs. We're set who are almost to the border. Can we please not fuck this up Christmas to? Hard games were. Do you really think I'm going to miss this opportunity when I said we were going to take whatever we wanted? It wasn't tough talk. I meant it. Carolyn, good. This looks like a party to me, right? Let us pray. God grant me the hostility to destroy the things. I cannot change the malice to mean the things I can and the wisdom to ignore the difference. Amen. But do this matter, are you ready? Right. Kimberly Bar games where he's playing this shithole like this. I see what you like about them on the ground. You bar games worth rock star. Consider this a friendly kidnapings. Everyone I. They. OK. Please don't hurt anyone. Do whatever you say. Good boy. Let's go. Give me one of those pills to calm him down. Fundamentally. Good boy. Don't that'll make this easier. I'm Val. This is Mitzi and Carolyn, you're my date. Let me ask Carolyn. We're getting good show back there. Thanks. Just relax right away. It's got a little driving to do. How about some mood music? Right now. All right. And I do if you think of anything else, you can give me a call, OK? You said they would mess up, said they'd fuck up. Not sure if this constitutes one of those. At least no one got killed this fat that we know of. Look, we still have a missing singer. Maybe a kidnaping. But honestly, with this, crew would not rule out a homicide. I don't think homicide. They wanted this guy for some reason, ransom. I don't know. I don't think this band or their fans have any money. Damn right. Still, no, the to be here by now, who knows how far these bitches might have gotten? APB has turned up nothing but these girls. I'm going to cock up soon and when they do? Right. Look, that was real smooth back there, but we can't keep wishing I look pushing our luck. You're not going soft on me, are you? We had nothing to lose before. But look at us now, we're set, now we're set. When I say, we're set. What was in those pills, those who beats us films, so. Right. You bet your sweet ass. We need a no tell motel and fast. A lover boy, you're still in the mood. We should be at the border soon. Home free. I don't think I can wait. I'm down here, but also up there. I'm on. So, Bard, how did you end up in that shithole back there? The label wants us to expand new territories. Last album didn't move enough units. Well, this album was good. I mean, it didn't do good. Some people just don't understand it. The general public has no taste. It's tough being a tortured artist. Right. Girls who? You get me the border. Oh, shit, and I think there's a motel up there to the South. Positive, no means they got away with it and hope they get away with it. I hope they knock over every aspect of it. But that means the new album will tell Paris how vacancies perform just for this from the road. Yes, we all know when 44 acts are going to catch. Gone for. Novel. I remember we had them tell you the room here, Rochelle's OK, thanks. And don't worry, I won't tell anyone about you guys. Wait a minute. Gavin, what do you mean? You won't tell anyone about what I mean? I kind of know if you guys are. I read about you online and of course, I know who bargains versus I bought. I'm a huge fan of the Christmas tip. It's just Christmas. That's no the. I just think you guys are cool. We should have kept your mouth shut, you dumb shit. Now you got to tell you where we were. Let me just say the part I was going to come see your band man. I'm stuck on this shift. It's really crazy, you know? Nothing ever happens in this town. 18 years of living here. Nothing. And then in one night, the two coolest things that have ever happened the Christmas hits playing that come out towards Christmas. It's no the Christmas hits playing and come out drawer and pulls orgasm playing the same night and Kathy Schwa and I'm stuck here on this shit job. But then the third coolest thing that's ever happened is you guys show up. You're all amazing. I love how you just don't give a fuck. Well, it's just great that we all have a fan club here, but you know who we are, and we can't just let you walk away from that. Look, just let me hang out with you guys for a little bit. You can. You can take me as a hostage. That's a terrible idea. Did you say poltergeist animals play? Yeah, Poltergeist them is actually my favorite part. No offense, but mine too. She's got the venom pictures all over her locker at work. No dice, kid. We don't want or need an entourage. Check it out. I can get into the motel safe. We haven't done the deposit. All the receipts for the week are still in there. You can have this. Seriously, just just let me hang out with you guys for like one night and then you can drop me off for the next hour or whatever. No way. You know, I could give you the money you could kidnap me or share. That's trucks. Let me do some drugs with you. Take me to the next town and shoot me there, just let me have one cool thing happen to me for once in my whole life, you're not really convincing me I am going to die in this shit hole. Either way, let me help you. That would be a terrible idea, having a hostage if we got into any problems with Johnny Law. We can just use them as a human shield. But suppose you guys them, they're playing this out now about 25 miles north. Cafe schwa you. I think for this band, Mitzi, you know you feel about bar there. Xerox from Poltergeist is that guy for me since I was 13. But we should not be heading back north. Egghead here may have just talked himself into a stay of execution. Well, the show's probably over now, anyway. Oh no. Shows that catfish will always start super late. Look, I can take you girls there, and I know where all the cops have their speed traps. I can get you there back here, no sweat. I know the back way into the club. I can be your tour guide and look out. We should probably just hold up here for the night. No way, sis. What are the goddamn chances our two favorite rock stars would be playing the same bumble fuck border town in the same night. It's kismet. This is just too crazy. There is no such thing as too crazy. Do you love him or not? Xerox Rhodesia? I mean, yeah, but a celebrity worship? That's not the same thing as love. It's exactly the same vow. Know what this thing is in your face right now. We could be dead tomorrow hostage. Let's go for a ride. So then I drop out of high school to take a job at the motel. I try to do some online courses, but they were so boring. You seem to be an expert on boring up to the stop sign and then take a right. Are we going back to the show? It's going to be a show, all right. Thank you, guys. The. You look at all these fucking people where they all come from. Barricades worth. Is that you? So is this what all the extreme vans are doing for attention these days? Xerox Hi. Nobody. This isn't here. So all of these ladies ladies. Xerox, Reduzir, I want you to meet your biggest fan. M m Xerox. This is a rather strange introduction. He seemed no stranger to strange, you're coming with us, the rest of you dorks. I suppose I have no choice in the matter. You need to back the fuck up. Oh, no. OK, Bill. What TV show you like a Twilight Zone? What TV show do you like, fruit front stone? Yeah, that's a good one. Look, bill, the show's over show's over. Yeah. Bill exits over there. Exits over there. Yes. Bill. Okay. Oh no. Got a handle handled. Are we done here? And grab your boy and let's motor. I'm Mitzi, I'm sorry, we fucked up your show. I wish I could have seen more of it. There will be other shows, I suppose. But. If you don't ask. I don't think they're going to kill this man. Hey, give him some of those drugs. Who's giving the orders here? Give him some of those drugs. Oh yeah, this is good stuff. Was it your word for it? You can't anymore. Shut the fuck up and navigate nerd. Evan Morales, thank you, miss that'll be all. Thank you, sir. That is that is up there. So. Yes, sir. McMurphy, you got anything pro job in and out, just like last time. But why would TROs hang around the same place and commit to crimes like this on the same night? It's erratic, which may indicate a flawed in their methodology, precisely, kid. That's what makes this game so impossible to predict. Like all women, they're crazy as fuck it flips my children switch to college whores pros when they're just doing typical irrational, crazy female bullshit. And we're standing here with God damn sons of our asses. I wonder what the next move will be. Chris? Mitzi? Carolyn McBath, Xerox company, cut up some drugs. So I'll be up soon. So. Let's all get to know each other. Carolyn, I'm sorry, we don't have a rock star for you if this cream puff isn't entertainment enough. Go ahead, come. So the AC. OK. And. Barred. Are you OK? A slight headache, but yeah, still unusual day. Now, shit. Listen. I think these girls are songs. If you want to get out of here, the keys are on the table. I don't think we're in any danger. I'm just saying, if you wanted to go, I can get you out of here. You are going to leave. I don't know. I can't say I have a bad time. Listen, we do not want to be implicated in whatever shit these girls have been doing. As far as anybody else in the world knows, we're kidnaped victims as long as we can keep that story straight. Maybe we have a chance to walk out of here. Provided we don't get killed first. That's the chance you take every time you walk across the street. Getting killed. I. John, a big. Another a bagel. We have some intel, it's about fucking time. We got nothing from the perimeter roadblock, which means that either they snuck over the border before we had a chance to get into place or they're masters of camouflage. Look at this. That's a hell of a threat. Looks like they met up at Sandhurst, beat up a guard and staged a daring daylight escape. three girls, three hard luck stories. WASHINGTON Melinda Star broken home father in prison She had a series of minor drug and weapons charges. Petty larceny receiving stolen goods, went to jail on aggravated assault, shot her boyfriend a domestic situation, possibly some abuse at the hands of her boyfriend. He survives press charges. She is locked up. Trembler Mitzie, an only survivor of a drunk driving accident parents killed, grew up in an orphanage. A string of minor shoplifting charges, vandalism jailed for grand larceny, broke into a cellphone store and stole $20,000 worth of phones and accessories. Still, Carol Anne Marie. Mom, this is real rough home situation in and out of foster and treatment homes ran away. Hotwire the car promptly drove it into a church. McMurphy, I think we can chalk all of this up to one thing was that daddy issues, do you really think it's that simple? Daddy issues. Yup. Always is. Daddy. Daddy, you wake up, wake up. Rise and shine, sunshine. She's gonna come, no. Ladies up and Adam, what time is time doesn't matter? I'm still alive, I'm starving to death. We should get food and keep at it, so that's not the plan. There's a plan already. I've been thinking. This is the first time since I was a little girl that I felt. Anything remotely resembling happiness. We've got the world on a charm bracelet, and these are the charms I can't help but feel like Carolyn's getting the short end of the stick. How do you mean who's your bard, your Xerox? Well, it doesn't matter. OK, I'm fine. It's Danny Lucifer. It's all right. I mean, yeah, but it's nothing. It's time we 86 goober patrol over here and got you with the program. Well, I mean, it's not like Danny, Lucifer is going to be just up the road like these guys were. Do you know that? No, but I don't got nothing. We're all equals here. What are you even fucking pay for equal work? Carolyn deserves just as much as us, and we're on a mission to find Danny Lucifer. Oh, this is dumb. Love is not dumb love. What do you even fucking talking about? Are you still high? You'll thank me for this, Val. You really shouldn't push this. We really should just keep heading south. I didn't request your input. Mitzi, this is fucking crazy. Nothing is crazy. No. The hell are you going to the car to get my fucking purse? Is that OK? All right. So then I got really into this guy honeymoon. He basically said that what makes us human is the fact that we suffer. So if you turn away from suffering, you turn away from being human, but a grotesque philosophy. I know it really resonated with me. I like John Stuart Mill. He said that we are essentially free to do whatever gives us pleasure so long as it doesn't bring harm or hurt anyone else. Sounds like cruelty. Do it, though, will sort of. But Crowley leaves out the part about not hurting anyone. Kind of like our hosts here. Harvey's home address to Daniel Lucifer. How did you get his address? I walked to the pay phone and call in information. Now it's northwest of here, about eight hours, we'd be going back over the border. All right, troops, grab your gear and get ready. Just think this through. This is a bad idea. I've thought it through. It's a great idea. It's a huge risk. People know who we are now. Everything is. Every man and woman is a star for 15 minutes. A-lister Warhol. What makes you think anyone knows who we are? Remember the clerk? He read about us. Oh yeah, everybody loves you guys. Fuck face. Now do we shoot you or tie you up and dump you out in the desert? I realize, Carolyn, you may have grown somewhat attached in your drug stupor. I vote for the Premiere. You don't kill me. We're not going to kill you. Are we Val? Whatever. But we're ditching and going north will be suicide. Our get real fuck reality. I'm following a higher calling here and you do well to appreciate who I'm doing this for. Come on, we can at least take him so far as Danny Lucifer's house, right? I fucking love Danny Lucifer. Me too. Oh, for fuck's sake, he's been a good hostage all along, Val. And besides, we could still use him as a human shield that we talked about for we go back over the border. You guys are bound and determined to fuck up my great idea. Please, and thank you. Fucking fine. Everybody get ready. Cannon, get ready. We got a break. What do you got? McMurphy we got our guys to try to run to see if there's any credit card or cell phones in the girls names. Got nothing? We did note that Mitzi Chandler's cell phone service was on a family plan. So we ran that to see if there's any possible family members that we could possibly interview. And and it turns out the ping that we got came from across the border, same place where our rock stars got abducted. Family going home for a visit. Or she has two phones. What kind of a lunatic would have to phone? Either way, it's a definite hit on our fugitive, so we call in the State Department. Nope. Here's the good part. The first phone ping that we got came from across the border. That was a couple of hours a couple of hours ago. Why don't you just grab a ping that we got came just a couple of minutes ago? That was northwest back in the states, back in the state. Hot down. All right. Follow up. Let's go, girl. Oh. So you're just scared to go to relax funny face, there's just a warning shot over his head, want to knock out the phone and want him to either registered a mobile Carolyn pump the gas. It's not been so far as to trying the well, although you could be fair just saying that you are just destroying your life and maybe you're not hurting hard enough. The good poetry, but whatever you hear, some part. How does it feel to be famous things kidnaping and baby doll? Before that famous rock star? Not a rock star. What about use your. Are you a rock star? And the term justice isn't this. We have the two best rock stars on the planet in the stolen car, and neither one of them thinks that they're actually rock stars. If Danny Lucifer's were honest, these guys hey, Bert Faith, how does it feel to be a nobody? Oh, wait, don't bother me with your answer. Premiere coming out of the engineering. The body count continues while we're headed in the right direction. We just need to keep checking that front and then we zero in and make examples of these serious lives. It's not just them. We're up against, you know, it's a whole culture that sees these bitches as some kind of folk who owns half of our already difficult job is to expose them for what they are. Do you really think that people are going to see these girls as heroes, given all the lives they destroyed, wholesale murder, kidnaping, armed robbery, families torn apart? It would be a different story if they will mean it really would. But they are not men. They are girls. Very bad. Girls are. Girls are. They aren't sexy, fuckin bitch. What's the worst thing you've ever done? So it's one of those albums. No, really the worst thing. Like, I don't mean from society's perspective, but your own. For example, I don't consider shooting the owner of a strip club or a drug dealer is bad. Maybe society wouldn't, either. But personally, the worst thing I've ever done. I know what that is. Well, when I was 13, before I ran away, Mama had this boyfriend named Buddy. I didn't like him, but I guess he was nice to my mom. Anyway, so but he got this job out of state and my mom wanted to move it out there. I had a boyfriend at the time, Tommy. He was my first real boyfriend, and I didn't want to leave him, so I gave Tommy his job and you scribbled panties to wipe everything up. I threw the dirty panties in the back of his car, so my mom that I'd seen a part to making out in the backseat with Brenda Donaldson. She was this girl from school that I hated. Mom didn't believe it at first. Till she found the panties. Holy shit, man. Yeah, you used to say they broke up, but mom was trying to call the cops somebody because Brenda was my age, and so he had to get out of town right away. And then Brenda even got taken out of school over it later. I realized that I had ruined my mother from ever being able to love another person again. Like. Ever. And Tommy dumped me. Sounds like you deserve this shit. You didn't dump me over that, though he dumped me because he found some other girl who would blow him. You should have appreciated those Hamptons strip at Douglas. You're talking about the worst thing you ever did. Now you've done ten things worse than that in the last day. And what about you? Hmm. What's the worst thing you ever did? I don't know. I have to think about it. Let someone else go first. I'll go when I was a kid, I went to this private Catholic school, a good Catholic boy x Catholic. Anyway, I went to the school and one year there was a new kid or the squint, or there was a black kid, the only black kid in school, maybe the only black kid that had ever gone there. I don't know. Anyway, I was happy that Arthur was there because until he showed up, I was kind of the number one most outcast picked on kid. We would talk to each other on the playground at recess because we sort of had that in common. one day the popular kids started picking on me worse than ever before because I'd been nice to Arthur sort of shoving me and calling me names, calling me and lover. You can say the N-word in the start. They were shoving me and calling me names and. I don't know if I was scared to get beat up, but in retrospect, I think that I just wanted the popular kids to like me, so I said, I'll show you everywhere. Arthur was sitting reading his book and I punched him in the face hard as I could. I don't think it hurt him much physically, but it broke his glasses. I just remember standing there and staring at those broken glasses on the ground and doing the most horrible sadness. All the other kids just loved. Arthur didn't cry. He just stood up and picked up his glasses and walked away without saying a word. I waited until I got home to cry and then I cried my eyes out experience to go to school the next day to. And I went right back to being the number one outcast. Nothing had changed. Children are extremely. I shouldn't have been one of them. I think about the kid in this stupid broken glass almost every day. But you realize you're wrong and you're a better person for it. You can't beat yourself up. Forever barred, Brad. But her own name is Brad. God damn it, motherfucker, what motherfucker? This assholes cruising in the left lane. What's the left lane is her fucking passing? And is any of this just cruising at under the speed limit? Hey, I saw the left lane is for fucking passing. But that's what the guy was slowing us down. You're the one wanting us to get to Danny Lewis first quick time so we can get back over the border. Cut him in there. You're the only one who cares about this Danny Lucifer Fool's errand. And we won't even make it there with the attention you just drew. Carolyn, you want to see Danny lose, right? Look, we are this close to having everything on our terms. Maybe we are but dumb shit like that is going to fuck it up 100%. Driving 50 miles an hour behind some dipshit is going to fuck us up 100%. For fuck's sake, there there are other cars on the road. People have cell phones, so we're going to be reported. We're not exactly nondescript. We're fucked now. OK, call me your tits. We'll get a new set of wheels. Then in a speech writing long anyhow. We've only got an hour left. Everybody take a pill. Relax, I'll pass off the next exit. Yeah, that to me, huh? Thank where? Thank you. Hey, we got a break. Let's hear it. All right. Highway road rage incident caught him by a the driver was killed by gunfire. Motorists got the tag number of the assailant. The same number that matches the vehicle with a couple of dead bodies were found in the woods. That's ten miles away from the club that the girls ran our girls. There's no doubt in my mind, guy. All right. We'll put out an APB. Maybe we'll get lucky with the girls home again. We've got this wrapped up like day old baby. So the worst thing I ever did was pretty dumb, but I still feel bad about it. I was in a shitty foster home with this creepy gross family. So I decided to steal a car and run away. So I fired up my car and the keys are up in the visor, just like in the movies. Who does that? Anyway, so I steal the car, but I didn't really know how to drive. It was as easy as I thought it was, so I didn't get very far. I kind of destroyed a church on accident. I mean, I hate religion, and I would feel so bad about it if I meant it. But this was some poor people's church, and I wrecked it totally like they could have fixed it even if they had the money. The judge made me apologize to some people from the church, and they weren't even mad about it because they were church people. They just looked at me like, OK. I think that's why I get so fucked up now. Bingo. Everybody get in the car thugs. Old people and cops drag Lincolns. You're the one wanting us to keep a low profile. Does it get any lower than this? This is all going to be worth it. Carolyn, get ready to meet your destiny when we find any Lucifer, you'll forget all about that stupid, poor people's church. Get us the fuck out of this parking lot. Bard, how are you feeling? You need to buy some more drugs. You're feeling good. I'm good. Dear artz. You came fresh as a daisy. Can we leave that Clark here? Oh, no, you promised we'd take him to see Danny Lucifer's house. I never promised anything. Some of you assume a lot. Fine. Mitzi, can we just fucking go please? You're all. The I ended up fucking off with were once by the time the Sun came up. They were begging me to stop. I can't. I know this is going to slip your fitness watch, but there's there's no sign of the girl ship parking lot. Phone thing checks out. There's a stolen car, though. We're almost there. Where is there are suspects? Yes. But where is there? We mean, I mean, why would these girls come all the way out here when they were already scot free across the border? They're not going home. They're not headed for any major city, we can tell. There has to be something so delicious out here that they can't resist. But reported something to do with the rock stars. The rock star, maybe they're headed to the West Coast, going to rob the rock stars house or hole up, maybe not those rock stars. There are three girls. The pack could suggest a third. Get that, call it a hook, but get on the horn and find out if there are any famous or some famous or even totally washed up musicians living within 100 mile radius of this area. zero. Do you have one worst thing you ever do? The worst thing I ever did, I was in college and I had this roommate. Woody. Yeah, he turned me on to dope. How's it been? What's? And this guy, he was full on dealing. What he had this hot girlfriend. It's a hard core junkie. And one day she came over looking for him. I guess he was out selling. I invited her in. She asked if I wanted to get high. And I wasn't hooked or anything, but she was real cute. So I said, OK. Anyway, she meant, do I want to get high off of what stage? And I knew it was a bad idea, but she came back into the room with stuff she snatched from his hiding place as we got settled in. She kind of nestled up to me. It felt really good. So. I went with it. And pretty soon we were making out, and then pretty soon we were going all the way. All. I don't know what happened while we were doing it. She kind of. Died. She showed she her body started to shake, and I didn't know I thought she was coming, but she wasn't. She was dying. And so I stopped. I mean, I didn't I didn't finish. But then I didn't know what the hell to do. And I really liked Woody, and I knew he loved this girl, and I didn't know if he'd be more mad at her dying. He fucking her or the fact that we stole his dope. I wrapped her up, drove her body to a drainage ditch, shoved her in. And then I tore the house apart to make it seem like someone had robbed the place. He never found the girl. But weeks after she went missing. But he showed me the engagement ring he was going to give her. That's a lot of your songs make a whole lot more sense now. That was a long time ago, isn't it? Yeah, I kind of forgot about it. I have one. Nobody cares. Dick ass. Fresh baby lamb chops boss after a rain. And the last one. Is citrus? This is the place. This doesn't look like Daniel's results. Have you ever seen Danny lose his house before? No. Then how do you know this is the address you gave me? If we just drove eight hours for nothing, we drove eight hours for nothing. It'll be your fault. This again, shut the fuck up and look on the porch. OK. Christ, what do we do now? Go in with guns blazing. Let's just ring the doorbell. You want to just go up and ring the doorbell like Avon calling. We could just go ring the doorbell. OK, let's just go up and ring the doorbell. Danny was the first fucking doorbell. He's not home. Maybe he's at band practice or maybe he's on tour. We have no fucking idea. We drove all this way. Danny Lucifer, we're home. Xerox, look at this. This is truly magnificent. I fucking love this guy. I hope he is on tour so we can just squad this place for a month. So what do we do now? He's not here. I say we take all the valuables we can and do so we can't take Jimmy Lucifer stuff. We shouldn't even be touching it. We're staying here until Danny Lucifer gets goddamn it. How this fucking obsession and shut up, Mitzi, your selfishness ends here. My selfishness to grow up on your right. This is the best show all the way. You say you're doing this for Carolyn. She doesn't ever even bother to ask me what my got us out of the joint. We started with one gun and a pack of weed. Make a whole new world for ourselves, knowing full, well, all right. Yeah, what? We might have beat the odds, but you keep moving the goalposts. I was happy when the world we made for ourselves was a duffel bag full of money and drugs. The duffel bag. Caroline, where the fuck is the duffel bag? Shit. I think I left it in the car. Don't let it out of your sight. Go get it. Money in drugs, missy. Those are going out fast. Look at what fate brought us. Don't you see what God or whatever wants for us? It's this. Love is not kidnaping the posters from your bedroom wall and dragging them into liking you, they're not on drugs now. Your fucking problem is that you don't believe anything. You cops are here. What? How many? Just one. We need the guns from the trunk. Looks like there's just one bag. Mr Lucifer, we had another report of fireworks being discharged. Carolyn, Guns. God damn it, let's fucking go. We can't stay here. Let's go. The that cop on the fucking line. OK, OK, let's get the fuck out of here. What? Was it fucking worth it? Linda Washington's Mitzi and chair, Carolyn Hill, don't fix this hard on yourself. It's really hard work and different happening. I'm doing I have a shut up asshole. No, look, you guys may only have a minute before more cops show up. I'm going to run outside and create a distraction while you guys try and find a back way out. No, brothers don't. All right, Peter Pace, you on the front. We're going back. I'm coming out. It's me, Darwin. I've heard our. David, hold your fire, you asshole who killed an armed man. Oh God. Hey, shoot back on you. Dumb shit. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Dum dum dum. They just go shit, McMurphy. That's why you don't hesitate with these pitches. Adobe Hill, no. Godspeed, Murphy. What's your EEG on back up still about eight minutes? I got it. We have you surrounded, release your hostages. We also. Could you repeat that louder? I can't hear you. My flat peg, you'll never take us alive. Carolyn's, dad, and now we're on a fucking suicide mission, you want to walk out that door. Go right ahead. I still can't hear you mixing and chatter. I'm going to call you on your cell phone and discuss the release of your hostages car. What phone does? Oh. You have another fucking phone. It's an emergency backup. You let them right to us. It's your fault we're here, it's your. Gave you so much money. Have you ever thought about anyone other than yourself? What about you? You're sweating it out. You big love is your fucking cry. Hate. Tell us what the car can't fucking know about. We're all better than that. It carries two fucking phone. They're going to tear each other. Yeah, I don't think we're going to live through this either. Don, it's been really nice getting to know you. It's Irwin YouTube, right? Hey, you know that story I told you about my roommate's girlfriend and the dog? Yeah, I made that up, but. Right. Why don't you just stop playing patty cake and address a situation that's facing you outside? All right. I'm so sorry. I got you into this, OK? Oh, what did I do? Xerox. So sorry. I really do love you. This is my fault. No. It's not your fault. This is the worst thing ever done. Nancy, let's see. The secret. Citrus from Linda Washington, it's just me and you and the hostages now, I don't mince words. You two are your friends. I was killed and I'll be your kill shot, too. I don't give a shit about your hostages. You can kill them or let them go. But I can promise you you won't be walking out of this. Oh, I got him, I got you, deny us. I still can't hear, you can't face me like a man. one of these two maniacs is going to get killed. The back isn't being covered right now. I think we can get out. The ammo is there. All right. He put out the fire used to take the money and drugs. We made an island does nothing. Yeah, but yeah, we did. You're my charm. If you were to come out the door with your hands up. Are your boys the last ones left? It's just us. Everyone else is dead. That's the best possible outcome. I'll get on the horn and call in the meat wagon and the fire brigade. You want. What did you just do? The worst thing I ever did. Danny Lucifer. What the fuck happened to my house? Fresh as a Daisy. What the fuck happened to my house? Chanel, aren't you? Any. Sexo final. The R-word, Kenny improvised explosive devices. Baby steps. Did you guys hear about the gang of girls that robbed the strip club like, no, yes, they are just like this army of girls? I heard there was like ten, ten or so. It is like a random army of girls killed, a bunch of sleazy dude like some sleazy street guys. Of course, the cops, they have absolutely positively no leads, and if they get away with it, how they get away with it, I hope they knock over every strip club in the country, half-finished brand, the strip clubs and I mean, Laquita. This is the revolution time here for it. Where it's physical. Let me give you. But we've embarrassed. These pussy cats.
