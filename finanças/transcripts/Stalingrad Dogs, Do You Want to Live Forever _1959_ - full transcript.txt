Parades are a magnificent show. Polished boots strike the road to the notes of rousing music. Eyes are sparking. The march goes forward... and ends only when shrouds flutter in the snow and wind... trying to cover what started so gloriously and sure of success. A dead soldier does not care... who won or lost the war. In 1942, when many Germans still believed in final victory... there were increasing signs in the East of a turn... for the worse ahead for the German armies. That the Russians had lined up for a counter-attack. 1,000 Panzers at the Volga. From our agents' reports, aerial photos and enemy reports... we are aware that the Russians are deploying large forces... in the Volga area and the arch of the Don. End of Summer: The Sixth Army reached Stalingrad as ordered. Thus the front line sprang forward... and cannot resist a pincer assault by the enemy. But Hitler called these warnings idiotic pessimism... and ordered the 6th Army, under Gen. Paulus' command... to conquer Stalingrad for him. This became the order of execution for the Sixth Army. These are their tombs on Mount Calvary in Stalingrad. These are their crypts - tractors, machine rooms in Stalingrad. These are the pylons that burned at the bomb... of the unknown German soldier... in Stalingrad. Only few came back... to tell of the life and death of the Sixth Army. And to erect a memorial without gilding it. STALINGRAD: DOGS, DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER? The base city of Charkow, 250 kms behind the front line... knows no worries yet when a German Artillery... Lieutenant Colonel starts on his way to the Volga front. I've got nothing to do with it. This is a different department. Wait until you are called. Well, Sergeant, what about my marching orders? They are being drawn up, sir. Why are you in such a hurry? Charkow is quite amusing. They've doctored me long enough at the military hospital. I can't stand the smell of carbonic acid any more. - Next! Well, whose turn is it? - Yes, me. - What's wrong with these people? - What do you expect? Worries... No work, hunger, no food and politically... understand? Of course. First we have to put things in order. Well, go, go, go! Next! But I want to say... Don't know what to do. Someone must help. I told you, we don't need a translator here any more. You act as if this were a day care center. Quick! Get Out! An order is an order. Next! Get my stuff ready. I'll be back in a minute. Yes, sir. - Please, wait! - What do you want? You're crying! What's the matter? If I can't prove by tomorrow that I've got a job... I'll be deported to Germany. Transported by force. So, that's it! And they did not have a job for you? Your countrymen treat us like dirt. Easy, easy. What can you do? - I mean, did you learn anything... - I'm a student... but you closed down the University as well. Your German is good. How come? My father insisted that I learn. He had a weakness for the Germans... before. I think I've got an idea. Maybe I can do something for you. - Why would you want to help me? - What do you mean, help... I simply cannot see a pretty girl crying. Hi, son of the Muses, how's business? Thanks for asking. My arm is OK again. The doctor gave me permission to give a concert tonight. - Wonderful! - I can't take you to the station. Well, that's not important. I've got a favor to ask you. I need help. - There's this girl... - As usual. They want to deport her. She's a student, speaks good German... they simply cannot deport someone like that. Can't you give her a job? In the Army social services? Yes, perhaps in the library. That's a good idea. We'll see. Here's her address. Damn it, I must leave! - Hello, Reverend Busch. - Good evening, Lt. Colonel. - How was your leave? - Good, thanks, but too short. - Do we have the same destination? - Yes, I think so. Stalingrad. Well, come in with me. Koepcke, the large suitcase. It's heavy. Hold my dog. Allow me, sir... Damnit, it weighs a ton! Are you surprised? 30 kilos of grub sent by mother. Well, scram, Sir. You may have time for a kiss. I'll be back in a second. What is it, Katja? Everything's OK. I've got a job in the library. Lieutenant Fuhrmann came for me. Well, wonderful. Thank God. Now at least you can stay here. That's why I came, to thank you. Lieutenant Fuhrmann said I would find you here. I didn't even get your name. Gerd, Gerd Wisse. Gerd Wisse. I don't believe it. We only met this morning, I distrusted you so much. Fuhrmann will take care of you. Have him write to me. For sure. This makes me puke! Göbbels celebrates our victory and we don't have Stalingrad yet. But sir, it can only be a matter of days. Do you think so, after failing to conquer it for three months? The Führer said the Russians are defeated and won't recover. Then I must be in the wrong war. In my battle area in Stalingrad, the Russians look healthy. They hold the best positions, while we are bleeding to death... Before going on leave, I saw 5 sapper battalions turn to cannon fodder to capture a few ruins - only to lose them. You've lived with it a long time, Reverend? Yes. It's madness. Where are you going, sir? I am being sent to the Rumanians as liaison officer. I don't envy you. Why not? What's the matter? The partisans blew up the rails. - The repairs will take all night. - Where are we? - Some 40 km from Kalatsch. - I must reach my men tomorrow. - Is there a phone here? - Opposite, the engineers. Thanks. I'll phone for a car. I'll take you with me, Reverend. We're going to the same place. May I join you, sir? I might be able to reach my liaison staff. Yes, come on. They'll bring us our baggage later. What was the name again? Sergeant Böse? Yes. - Your tea. - Thank you. - Matka, any tea left for us? - Yes, sure. Send me the car as soon as possible. Gentlemen, I've got an idea. First let's get a proper meal. Matka, have you got some eggs? One. - Only one? - Yes. Reverend, you cut the potatoes into the pan. Gladly, if you think I can handle that. I do it. How many are we? - 1, 2, 3, 4... - 4! 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 mouths counting the dog. Lieutenant-Colonel... you get 2 sausages from my backpack. - Yes, sir. - You've got a big family. - Many children. - And your husband? The father? Dead, war. Who helps you now? Helps? Thank you Batuschka, thanks. Thank you very much. I thought Moscow had done away with that already. Didn't they try in Germany too? They had no success. In spite of Military Academies and Hitler Youth. Everything passes, Mr. Wisse, but not this. Rely on that. I was brought up in a Military Academy. We learned to rely on ourselves - and this set us on the right track. Until you blow a tire. See, I'm something like a jack of all trades. For organizing and all that. And besides, I specialize in engines. You understand? You'll end up by smashing the car, you specialist! Oh, no, it is used to a lot. What happened to your hand? Nothing too bad. A small splinter... but unfortunately not enough to get a discharge. Sentries! Attention! Sgt. Böse. Two men, intelligence liaison, one radio operator. Thanks. Hope we work well together. At ease. Lance-Corporal Sander. Radio operator Klausch. Come, please, sir. Thanks. Krämer, take care of the dog. Yes, sir. Come here, girl. Tell me, what do we have here? In this ravine is the staff of the Rumanian Division. This is Gen... Kutriano's bunker, and this is your new home. There are rat holes. Captain Scherer's expecting you. Thank you. Lieutenant-Colonel Wisse reporting for duty! I'm glad you're here. Welcome. Have a seat. Excuse my informality, but as you see, I'm packing. What took you so long? The partisans blew up the rails at Kalatsch. It's already starting in Kalatsch as well. Well, no wonder. You did well phoning immediately. I'm in a rush. I must reach Kalatsch at noon, or I'll lose my connecting train. This is quite comfortable. A nice cave for hibernating. You'll hardly get to do that. There are rumors, reports and assumptions. The Russkies are cooking something up. Nasty. - Really? - Böse will tell you everything. I've already notified Kutriano that you're coming. He's a nice, old warhorse. In general, Rumanians are good and decent soldiers. Obedient to the death. One second. - Krämer, is the car tank full? - Nearly, sir. Hurry up, man! Here you've got first-class men, whom you can trust. I also wanted to tell you... there's a German Major from the Army Corps acting as tactical coordinator with the Rumanians. Linkmann. He's a handful. But you're not subordinate to him... ...not under his discipline. I think I've got everything. Come on. Well Böse, I leave Lieut.-Col. Wisse to your tender mercies. This sergeant is the soul of our business. All the best. All the best to you, Captain. Don't take things too lightly here, Wisse. Farewell. Have a good trip, Captain. And don't forget to report to the Army Corps. What're you waiting for, Krämer? We're leaving, Captain. Was he in a hurry! He's right, we'd all wish to go with him. Don't exaggerate, Böse. You've got it easy, here. It's deceiving. We intelligence people hear the grass grow. Do you know what order will be issued tonight? - Well? - No more leaves. Now I understand why he was in such a hurry! Where's Major Linkmann's bunker? - Down there. I'll take you there. - Thanks. Lieut.-Col. Wisse, new Head of the Intelligence Liaison Staff. Linkmann. You look too damn young for such a difficult position. Three years experience at the front counts double, Sir. Well, we shall see. I hope you'll be smarter than Scherer. I'm glad to be rid of that pessimist. He made a Russian Army out of every patrol report. It seems to me he was near a nervous breakdown. That's unavoidable when one only sees ghosts. We belong to the Fifty First Army Corps of Gen. Von Steiglitz. First-class men. What we need here, is to be smart. Keep your distance from the Rumanians. Bad soldiers. Bad training. Officers not much better. In brief, a bunch of no-good, hysterical men. The important thing is - don't fall for it, keep your cool. - Nerves of steel. - I've got them. Thanks. And as for us two... I've already heard of you at the Army Corps. Excellent career. Military Academy, etc. I myself have been in this for a long time. Yes, it's not easy here. We must stick together. - Of course, sir. - Well, until tonight, then. We always eat with the General. I'll introduce you. Thank you, sir. My division is in an extremely difficult position. We're holding a 19-km. area instead of 5 or 6, as usual. Thank you. Since the Summer advance, we fight without pause. We have no heavy weapons, no tanks, no anti-tank weapons. Not even mines, and no reserves at all. For weeks we've known that the Russians are deploying full force. For weeks I've asked Scherer to ask for help. He did his best, but had no success. I'll see what I can do, immediately General. Thank you, but I think it's already too late. As usual, Major Linkmann smiles superciliously. He doesn't believe in a Russian attack. Even knowing the situation. I don't deny the possibility of an attack. I think more of our capacity to drive back the enemy than you. Tanks cannot be squashed with bare hands. I need weapons. The High Command is fully aware of the situation. And why is nothing done? I'm not privy to the Führer's plans. Thank you, gentlemen. The ill-starred night of November 11, 1942 has set in. Silence lies over the land. Only the voice from Moscow hammers monotonously, unwavering... out of the radio: every seven seconds a German soldier dies. Stalingrad - a mass grave. Every seven seconds a German soldier dies. Stalingrad - a mass grave. Klausch, switch the bloody thing off! I can't. Why not? Half an hour ago they issued an order, to keep on receiving. The Moscow interference emitter is on the same wavelength. I feel as if I'm being beaten up. The General! Please connect me with your Corps. General Von Steidlitz. Go on, Klausch. Here Mars, urgently, General Von Seidlitz... for General Kutriano. Yes, it's a personal call. Switch that thing off! I'm giving over. Kutriano. General, I've consulted with my superiors... and I have an important message for you. A few minutes ago we deciphered a radio signal. It's Stalin's Order of the Day. The Russian full-scale attack has been set for today at 6 a.m. Of course, we don't know where the main thrust will take place. But if it's in my area, I cannot guarantee anything. As you know, I have no heavy weapons. May I ask you for your backup in case of emergency? Thanks, General. We're waiting for further orders. Over and out. It's on. The General promised me help in case of emergency. In any case, we won't give in easily. - Of course, General. - He won't leave us in the lurch. Synchronize your watches. One O-five. Lieut. Col. Kesselbach, sir. Take your tanks to the Rumanians. It's started. - What time is it? - 2:30. Has anything happened? We just got a report. The Russians will attack at 6 a.m. today. Come on, Wisse, the Russians... Now let us think quietly. It's obvious that the Russians will attack. Well... Why do you think the Rumanians have got no heavy weapons? They are not reliable, see. I've got a theory. The Führer will use them as cannon-fodder. - What? - Yes, yes. But that, of course, doesn't include us. No, so there's only one thing for us to do. Let's keep our eyes and ears open, and keep calm... and it things go wrong, we take the jalopy and leave. Do you understand? Paulus. Of course we've reported the imminent attack to the troops. What? Repeat. Over and out. Ground fog forecast. They cannot send the Air Force. No air-support? That's exactly what we needed! I wonder, Schmidt, have we done everything humanly possible? Everything humanly possible, General. The question is, will it be enough? That's impossible, Schmund. The Führer must talk to me. It's important. He must release the stand-by tank corps for battle. It must leave without delay. Make it as urgent as possible. We cannot watch this with folded arms. Over and out. How can he win the war demoting his General Staff to privates! He calls us plumbers. I've got nothing against that... but he should let us do our work when a water pipe bursts! The Chief of Staff phoned again, mein Führer. May I ask for a decision. Let him line up the tank corps. Further orders will be given. Yes, mein Führer. Klausch, report this to the Army Corps. After 3 hours of bombardment, the Russians attack... - with heavy tanks, a wide front. - Yes, sir. - Böse, take charge of the base. - Yes, sir. Pack our stuff so that we're ready if we must leave. Krämer, stay ready on the hill. I'm at the Division command post. The Russians are approaching our artillery shelters. 3rd and 4th battery are defending them bitterly. The sappers are surrounded and resisting. There it is - The Russians got through! Attention, tank! Send them a heavy charge! Stay, stay! Stay here! Keep calm! There are only a few scattered tanks! Go! Your turn! Lieut.-Col. of the Fifty First Army Corps arriving! You're late, but thanks anyhow. Keep the Russian tanks off, so I can save what still can be. Hello, young Knight, well done! I saw you. You're good at that. Are you nuts, running around outside instead of staying here! I went to the divisional command post. Your sergeant refused me the car to drive to the Corps. We did agree that I'd get the car. It's a misunderstanding. I understood you differently. What are you insinuating? I made myself perfectly clear. I'll report you, just you wait! He only obeys my orders. I'm responsible. Don't be so arrogant! Your responsibility! They just ordered me to withdraw my division. Take the necessary steps. Report to your service post... Thanks for help, Kesselbach came with tanks, covers our retreat. - Yes, sir. - I didn't see you this morning. - I didn't have a car. - The others also came by foot. Someone had to keep in contact with the Corps. Your duty as tactical officer was to remain with me. - Wisse was not here either. - Thanks to his personal... intervention, he saved us from a dangerous situation. We thank you, son. A strange retreat has begun, not westward... to the saving German Front, but eastward, deeper into Russia. Pushed, harassed by the enemy tanks... that have cut their connection to their own lines. I could really blow my cool with these Army bureaucrats. I got only two cans of gas out of them and... the depot is chock full of rags and grub for the whole division. So? I thought we could organize something. Since we've lost everything. But they won't give us anything. They want to burn it all up. What? They're nuts! Let's have another look. This is stupid. I've got orders to burn the depot in half an hour... so that nothing falls in enemy hands. - So, you can't clear the depot? - Of course not. Be reasonable! Do you want to blow up all this stuff? Out there are hungry and freezing men who've fought the whole day. - I've got my orders. - I don't give a shit. Krämer, leave that and wait till you get instructions. What do you intend to do? I'll tell you. Since there's no higher ranking officer around... I'll take charge of clearing the depot, and burn the rest. How dare you! Anybody could say this. If you're dying to fire, you'll get your wish very soon. The Russians won't waste much time on you... Well, I give in to violence. But under protest. And you will sign a protocol. Krämer! Here you are. Russian winter just arrived. And inside there, he's got furs. What are we waiting for? Let's take a few with us. Sergeant, here, please. Are you nuts? The Russians are at our heels and you're playing Christmas? Yes, sir. The depot cop wanted to burn everything... The men should take all they can carry. Alright. But now leave. My tanks can't keep the Russians off for more than 15 minutes. Yes, sir. Give me the fuel. The scope of the Russian breach exceeds my worst fears. With strong armored forces, the Russians... have broken through southward and are behind the Sixth Army. South of Stalingrad they thrust to the West and Northwest... and broke through the Rumanian front. Both arms of the pincers met at Kalatsch. My Führer, the 6th Army with one tank corps and 4 army corps and twenty-two divisions, is surrounded. Even worse, the Russian winter is early, and unusually harsh. Warm winter clothes failed to reach the troops. Go on. We have to make a decision, immediately. Almost 250,000 German soldiers are surrounded. Of these, 25,000 are injured. Food and ammunition supplies will soon be so scarce... that a catastrophe looms over the Sixth Army... unless you order them to break ranks. Can you give me a 100% guarantee that the 6th Army will be saved? No, my Führer. I can give you a 100% guarantee that the 6th Army will be lost... unless you order them to break ranks. We've been waiting for days for the order to break ranks... but the Führer is hesitating, and Paulus is hesitating. Everything has been discussed! It's not the first time an Army is surrounded. I've seen this once already. This can only be broken through with an iron hand! But it must be done quickly. Come on, Seidlitz, give me the weather report. Heavy frost, ground frozen hard. Rivers and streams frozen - can support guns. That's enough for me. Over and out. In such a weather one wouldn't turn out a dog. You're wrong, Klausius. We have to do something, immediately. - Yes, sir! - I'm fed up with waiting! I'll force them to see that we have to act... and start things rolling. Then, all the rest will follow. Order my divisions to take only weapons, ammunition... food and fuel. Destroy all the rest. Your high-handedness has caused a dangerous situation. Breaking ranks had been decided upon. But the senior staff decided otherwise. They forbid us to break ranks. Help will come from outside. We stay put and dig in. It's madness! - It's an order from the Führer. - It's a disaster. My men are lying in the open steppe, without shelters... unprotected against this murderous cold. It's your rashness which caused this situation. You're to blame. I had to shorten the front. We have to break ranks... even against the orders given by the Führer. We don't know the overall situation. There's nothing we can do, but obey. The defeated Rumanian Div. Set up temporary quarters in a ravine. The German Intelligence Staff is also quartered there. Condemned to inactivity, as the whole 6th Army. Listen, Kurt, phone again. My brother-in-law at the Army Corps is packing. They have to retreat. They can't hold their position. There's a lot of trouble at Headquarters. I'm telling you, this time everything is going wrong. Yes, our beloved Führer is nuts. Now his wisdom has come to an end. I take exception to such statements, Krämer. Lieut.-Col. Krämer doesn't mean it. But we're all getting nervous. You yourself were at the Army Corps today. Come on, don't take it so hard. Everything will be OK. Keep your stiff upper lip. That's just words. We would like a proper answer. How will this go on? To tell you the truth, guys, I myself don't know. We're surrounded and must wait. What for, no one knows. Rations are to be cut again... they'll try to supply us by air, provided we can hold the airfields. Yeah, that's it, more or less. Get warm, sir. Thanks, Krämer. What's going on here? Council of war? Yes, sir. We were discussing the situation. - Well, is my car ready? - Yes, sir. - So you're leaving us today? - Yes. I'm taking over an artillery unit in Stalingrad. At long last, a proper assignment. It is absolutely forbidden to chat with the men. The truth cannot hurt them. It undermines their trust in the superiors. You seem to have forgotten all you've been taught. I'd like to have you under my command - I'd get you in shape. I don't believe you'll have the pleasure, Major. - You think so? - Yes. Your days are counted too. Let's go, Krämer! Thank God he's gone. I'll never forgive him for wanting to escape. And I think he'll never forgive you, should he know... that you've noticed it. In order to survive, the Sixth Army had requested daily supplies of 750 tons... of food, ammunition and medical supplies. Hitler and Göring authorized them. But they did not keep their promise. At first, 20% of the required tonnage reached the pocket... then only 10% and later... when they lost the main airfields, nothing more got in. I can't do it. You must understand! Why are you so stingy? I repair your radios and you won't give me anything. We can give you cigarettes, Krämer. Tobacco. Tobacco. My jalopy can't run on tobacco. There's nothing I can do. The old man has become unbearable. Sticking his nose everywhere and controlling the supplies. OK. OK. Go to hell. There he is. What are you doing here? This time you were unsuccessful, weren't you? Unfortunately I was, sir. Come here, all of you. Yes, you too... or don't you want to be out of this shitty pocket by Christmas? Who doesn't! A beautiful dream, sir. A beautiful dream? You'd be surprised! Come here, and give me a piece of chalk. Pay attention. I've come from a meeting at the division... they're preparing something super. Well... This is us here, surrounded and encircled. As you know, the Sixth Army... is completely isolated, for this is the new German front line. Now, a completely new armored army is coming from the South... under the command of Colonel Hooth. He's advanced from a distance of 400 kilometers... and broken through, and is 150 kilometers away from us. As soon as he's sufficiently near... - Where is General Hooth? - There, by the tank. - Well? What's happening? - We can finally go on. We lost another 2 tanks. The Russkies are getting stronger. However, with our 200 tanks we finished 1,000 Russian tanks. But new ones spring up like mushrooms - It's uncanny. Don't be so pessimistic. We must break through. Another 100 km. The surrounded men are waiting for us. Keep telling the men they'll be out by Christmas. Yes. Come on, guys, let's go. Damn it, a report. We've waited long enough for it. Thanks, over and out. Guys, Hooth is 50 kilometers away. Any time now we'll get a break-ranks order. Throw away whatever you cannot use. Krämer, organize a few more cans of fuel for the jalopy. Right, even if I have to steal them. Böse, when you get the order, blow up the radio patrol car. - I'll get it ready. - Now speak against the Führer. Quick, quick, decipher the bullshit. I thought you had learned how to do it. Only a second, sir. At Milerovo... That's far away, I'm not interested. It's the front of the Eighth Italian Army. So what? The Russians broke through. - What! - That's what it says, sir. Damn it! Now they can attack our flanks. - We're getting into hell. - Worse than that. Wait, we're 48 kilometers from the pocket. We've got a chance. Paulus must line up immediately and come towards me. We can make it, but he must hurry. That's impossible. Hooth's 48 kilometers away and I only have fuel for 30 km. But there's only 18 kilometers in between. We could make it. When Hitler knew of our explosives, he forbid us... from breaking ranks, even though we had arranged it. I'm now adopting his own approach... without enough fuel, we'd be left helpless in the steppe. We should attempt it anyhow. Give the army a chance, General. Our men know what's going on. You can expect them to fight twice as hard. An unsuccessful escape could mean the end of my army. Therefore, I cannot risk it. That's all I wanted to tell you. Thank you, gentlemen. - Friedrich. - What? You must break ranks and get to Hooth. - You know what my orders are. - They are irrational. - Why do you obey them? - We swore allegiance to Hitler. We have a higher responsibility than tradition and honor. We are responsible to the people and our soldiers. Empty words. We're carrying out a mission here. - We tie up Russian forces. - Perhaps today... but tomorrow the Russians can and will do whatever they want. - My hands are tied by orders. - Disobey them. I'm not a rebel. Just imagine the consequences of such disobedience. Anarchy, revolt. My army would endanger the whole Eastern front. People and Army would never condone the ensuing chaos. It would be the act of a rebel hero, like Jorg Von Wartenburg. He saved Prussia by refusing to obey the king's orders. I'm no Jorg Von Wartenburg. And this is a completely different situation. I know how we are. I'd stand alone... no one would support me. I'm not changing my mind. We're not breaking ranks. You're passing the death sentence on the Sixth Army. A bitter Christmas present for our soldiers. No need for you to continue burning. What does that mean? The rescue operation of General Hooth went wrong. We're not deploying. We're not breaking ranks. Well, then, Merry Christmas. We should march South to break ranks. The Russian tanks have squashed us. Give him a drink and something to eat. Quick. There's no need. He's dead. Do you hear, Krämer? It's amazing. What is it? Wanna hear something, sir? Klausch is receiving. Let's go to him. OK. Come on. Lost German soldiers wander through the Christmas night... without knowing where they belong. I found them in the snow covered heights... under the frozen hollows... and so I found you here today. And I stopped you... to bring you the Christmas message of peace on earth. Which seems to be in the wrong place here. But believe me when I tell you... that beyond the storm and the roaring of guns... God's voice comes through to us and tells us... that when all doors are closed... His door is always open. And now, let me bless you... "May the Lord bless you and keep you..." "May the Lord shine His face upon you and be gracious..." "May the Lord shine his countenance upon you..." "And give you peace. Amen." Why, we know each other. Yes, in the Russian farmhouse... with Lieutenant-Colonel Kesselbach. Sure, you're the young First Lieutenant, Military Academy... with good prescriptions for all situations. I'm not so sure any more, Reverend. Here everything is hard to understand. You question the meaning of it all. There's no reasonable answer. The only thing left is our belief in God... but for you that is probably no consolation. How could it? I lost my parents very young and you know... that those who raised me denied God. Follow your instincts through all the hardships... you're suffering here. I'm telling you, sometimes God only reveals himself in Hell. I've summoned you to tell you... that my division has now been subordinated to the Sixth Army. Thus, your mission here has come to an end. I have to inform you, dear Wisse, that you're being... transferred as battery commander to Stalingrad. You'll go with Sergeant Böse and private Krämer. They'll tell you all the rest at the Army Corps. For your heroic action, my Supreme Command grants you... the Rumanian Order of Courage. - Congratulations. - Thank you, General. To all of you, my heartfelt appreciation and all the best. Thank you, General. Dismiss them. Dismissed! Potomnik, Goroditsche. And now, a joke. Berlin, 2,431 kilometers. Now let's agonize over our choice. Yeah, Berlin was nice. I met a brunette, a sugar-baby. We know Berlin, now we're going to Stalingrad via Goroditsche. I'm curious to know what that resort is like. My new regimental commander's waiting there. I'm curious... In civilian life I'm a scientist. A botanist. A man who studies flowers, plants and their growth. It was fate's bitter irony that took me to the Volga. There's no growth here... only death, rot. I don't believe in the success of Operation Stalingrad. I don't want to make you sad, but you must know the truth. You were recommended as a good officer. I'm glad you're here. Your obedient servant, sir. You'll take over the Third battery. Report to your unit commander, Linkmann. He'll instruct you. May I ask if Linkmann was responsible for my transfer? He was very interested in you. We did not always work together in harmony. As you see, he's not vindictive. Until tomorrow. Take my scarf. With my fat neck, I don't need one. - No way. - Take it and shut up. Your cough is getting on my nerves. - I'm your superior officer. - These are health reasons. What is it, sir? This beats me. This promises to be a nice health resort. And do you know who manages the resort? Major Linkmann. Good God! I told you, we should have gone to Berlin! This won't be a joke. We'll see. Yes, that's my last word. I'm not allowing a single shot. Let the infantry see what it does without artillery. Over. Lt. Col. Wisse, transferred as commander, Third battery. Why, what a surprise! Not for you, Major. No, you're right there. I had you already earmarked for my unit. I hear that you were already granted a medal. Yes, sir. The Rumanian Order of Courage. Well, Rumanians have different yardsticks - no spite intended. Here in Stalingrad you can prove what a guy you are. - I'll give you a chance. - That's nice of you, sir. I demand high performance. Just now we're faced with a crisis, but it's temporary. But the Führer needs men of iron to overcome problems. So, don't go soft on me... in spite of the hunger, the cold and other hardships. I have two other men from intelligence with me. Who are they? Sergeant Böse and Private Krämer. Böse, my, my. I had my eye on him already. He's so devoid of military character. I'll find some use for him here with me. As for Krämer, you better take him to the front with you. At the battery position you'll need whoever you can get. Third battery: one officer, four NCO's, thirty-eight men, 4 guns. One constable and two forward observers in Stalingrad. Damn it, Fuhrmann, in this lousy pocket we all meet again. - How long have you been here? - They sent me 2 days after you. And that was the end of beautiful Charkow. Tell me, there was that Russian girl, Katja. Katja? Oh, yes. The job was eliminated. End of a dream. - What happened to her? - I don't know. She was sent to Germany or went underground with her own people. I see. How are things here? Here we are 1,400 meters from Stalingrad. We only have to back up the infantry My God, this is Stalingrad. And under this debris lie ten thousand corpses. There are 2,000 guns of every caliber, all worthless... because we haven't received ammunition for weeks. Linkmann has to authorize every shot. We still have twelve rounds per gun. That's it. What were they thinking of? That's what we always wonder. You're cold. Doesn't the Battery have winter clothes? Nothing arrived. It's the Russians or the cold. Fuhrmann, take my fur coat. I can't take it. Bullshit, you can and you will. I've got another one. We looted a storage depot. And now, let's have a look at the forward observation post. By day you won't reach it alive. Every square meter is covered by Russian fire. But when darkness sets in, I'll be glad to take you. Let's go! - Stop! Password! - Stop. - Sommerschmidt? - Yes, sir. Hello, sir. Konowsky and two forward observers. No special events. - Thank you, Konowsky. - Our new commander, Wisse. - Good evening, Konowsky. - Hello, sir. - Private Krämer. - Hello. I'm just distributing rations. This looks pathetic. The Russians gunned down our food. Not a sausage got through. Did the gentlemen bring something to eat? - Unfortunately, not. - Have a cigarette, constable. Super! Thank you. They noticed we have guests. But the roof will hold. What's the situation here? Right and left, the infantry. They control the crossroads. In the upper floor of the opposite house, the Russians. In the cellar are our men as tenants, or vice versa. In the same house? That's impossible! In Stalingrad everything's possible, sir. Sometimes the front line divides the houses vertically. We had a toilet where I went every morning for 15 minutes... to think out our problems. One morning I arrive... and there's this Russian. In my poor Russian... I tell him: "Come on, boy, scram!" He left, saying "The Prussians won't even let you shit in peace!" I think you're telling tales, Konowsky. My word, sir. As sure as I'm standing here. - Can I see the forward post? - Yeah, I'll take the lead. Fuhrmann, you stay here. B2 Konowsky. Yes, we've noticed it too. Sure, we're in the same boat. Will do. Sir, a question. Do you have any food? No? That's a pity. Over and out. The infantry lieutenant. The Russians lined up two tanks and one anti-aircraft gun. So? This is a key position. It controls the crossroads. It must be held at all costs. And a few houses down... are Paulus' new quarters. - That's news to me. - Well, a nice cellar hole. With water running... down the walls. Call the battery and tell them... that we're staying here tonight. I want to see what's going on. Yes, sir. The Russians are attacking. Konowsky, get me Major Linkmann on the phone. He must authorize some rounds for our battery. I've already spoken to the unit. He refused point blank. Not even a single grenade. They say not to be so pompous about it. Damn it, a direct hit into our cellar. - I'll go check. - Stay here, sir. - It's full of sharpshooters. - I'll take care. Damn it, Gerd, were we lucky! Russian tanks and infantry. Go forward with a MG, Schmidt. Fuhrmann and Krämer, secure the rear. Come with me. Yes. OK. Further to the right, Schmidt. Eh, Krämer. There, Krämer. We'll get them. Well, go on. That could have easily gone wrong. Linkmann is a shit, he could have authorized a round. Without the gun, we would've been a sorry sight. I got me a pal. He's slightly beaten. We don't take prisoners. No side takes them. Not with me, Konowsky. Let him go. Fuhrmann, tell him to go back to his people. Wait! At least he should leave his satchel. Come here. Scram, go! Look what the Russians get for food! Look at that! A smoked herring and bread... lard and millet. These are delicacies! And what do we get? An empty stomach. What are we doing on this side of the world? I understand that the Russians want to throw us out. Even the workers, women and children fight for it. We haven't lost anything here. Sir, a negotiator with a white flag. The Russian major wants to thank you... for sending the prisoner back. He let me go in exchange. He proposes a thirty minute cease fire... so that both sides can collect their wounded. Good idea. I'm going with him to see the infantry commander. Come. During these wretched thirty minutes... an episode took place, which the Germans... as well as the Russians reported and vouched for. Time out. Come, Fuhrmann, the show is over. On January 10, 1943, the Russians attack full force to blow up the pocket after Hitler refuses to surrender, and orders to fight to the last bullet. The Sixth Army offers desperate resistance. Of course I'm retreating the front line. Yes, even going against orders. The Russians breached 3 points in the pocket, don't you see? Is there no one capable of taking over? An Army is being senselessly used as cannon fodder! Admit it, the Russians could cut the pocket to pieces. They even took over the last large airfield at Potomnik. I know. We still have Gomrak and Stalingradsky. - They're worthless. - Shut up! This is pure defeatism. The Führer knows what he does. He cannot prevent all hell from breaking loose! Go to the front and see what's going on. Out of 16, only 4 guns are left. No ammunition, no food. They took away 30 more men for the battle troops. It's more important for us to get ready for infantry warfare. That'll do. We are gunners, and will stay by our guns. Of course we need ammunition and food. The airfield at Gomrak has enough of that stuff. Go and organize whatever you need. And don't come back empty handed! - And where will I find you, sir? - Here, of course. What do you mean? You sent our last four guns to Stalingrad. Lieutenant Fuhrmann is the only officer there. - So what? - Wouldn't it be better if we... both go to Stalingrad and send someone else to Gomrak? Kindly stop giving idiotic advice. I'm in charge here. Get lost! Go to Gomrak! Look at this! How many calories does an adult need? In times of peace, 3,500. A few ounces of bread and a sliver of sausage? How can I make it through minus 30 degrees on that! Don't rail like that! We are in the same shit. Man, I'm not putting up with this shit any more... shit! Konowsky, are you nuts? Listen... I'll keep this for you and you'll eat it later. - What's the matter? - He's crazed with hunger again. OK. OK. We're going to Gomrak, to get food and ammunition. Well, at long last, sir. To eat properly once, to fill our bellies. Hello, Böse. What did the doctor say? Pneumonia. There's nothing he can do. May I come back? I have to go back with the fighting men. With pneumonia? Are you crazy? Stay where you are! - Then I'll starve. - What? I've just got orders, as of today... food is only distributed to fighting men. Sir, Reverend Busch says he has an appointment. Right. Bring him in. Yes, General. Come in, Reverend. You said on the phone that it was urgent. What is it? General, it has to do with the order... to distribute food only to fighting troops. Yes. That means approximately 50,000 wounded men... are condemned to starve to death in the cellars of Stalingrad. Why do you come to me? I don't know of such an order and wouldn't have signed it. I've gone to every position, and no one deals with it. But someone must be responsible for such an inhuman order! I don't know who issued it. But let me tell you something else. There are no humane wars. But we are soldiers. You, too, wear an uniform. I cannot go on watching such suffering! I'm surprised at you, Reverend. The Church prays for our Army's victory. But if victory inexorably demands victims, you say... This is impossible. Where's the rationale? The Church prays for peace and justice, but this is not a just war. Be careful with your words! It could be high treason! The men die for nothing. Their sacrifice is senseless. Reverend Busch... only time will tell who of us is right. Our sacrifice for Stalingrad is a military necessity. How could I live, unless I was convinced of that? Wouldn't it be a tragedy if your conviction was wrong? Go with God, General. - What do you want? - Food and ammunition. Funny. You're nuts. You want ammunition? It's weeks since they brought any. We only have... prayer books, sacks full of pepper, 2,000 Hitler portraits... OK. OK. What about food? You're being ridiculous. This is the asshole of the world. And there goes the last way out of this damn pocket. In one hour the Russians will be here! We're finished. What, there's nothing to eat? Look at this body. This machine weighs 200 lbs. In order to work, it must be lubed. Lubed with bread, butter, eggs... meat. Lots of meat, potatoes. Now he's going to crack up. You're stupid if you think one can do without. Stupid. Stay here. Let me through. Eh, wait, wait! Stay here. I'm leaving here, let me through, let me through! I want to go with them. Stop! Konowsky, behave! Let me go through. Man, I'm leaving here. Konowsky, don't do anything stupid! Back off. Stay there. Stay there. It's only for the seriously wounded. We are overloaded. I'm wounded. I'm seriously wounded, pal. Don't come forward. Stay put. Get lost, man. How do we get home? Open the door. What did I do to you, pigs? Konowsky. I saw it. The tail broke his neck. Come on, quick! Where have you been so long? In Gomrak. As you should know. Konowsky is dead. Did you carry out my orders? For your information, it's hopeless. There is no ammunition, nor food. What? My God, you're quite a failure! While you went to Gomrak for a stroll, all hell broke lose. Guns lost, operators gone, and we're moving to Stalingrad-Center. Good Lord, what about Fuhrmann? I've no idea. Dead, missing... I don't know. We've been ordered to form battle troops. - You'll be responsible for it. - Where do I get the men? I don't care. Wherever you can find them. From the hospital, look for the shirkers and cowards. If there are any, the military police should do it. Stop blabbering. You're on your own. Go on, that's an order... and take Krämer with you, and Böse too. - He's just sitting around here. - He's sick. He has pneumonia. Böse goes with you. I won't discuss it any longer, this is not a kindergarten. And don't come back with stupid excuses, either. It's about time you proved yourself to me. Is it still important? That night, Stalingrad burned from end to end. That night Göring celebrates the Reich's 10th anniversary. He also refers to Stalingrad. On the 10th anniversary of our take over... ...the Führer cannot be with us... Hey, what are you doing here? I've been ordered to look for shirkers. So, shirkers. Well, look around. There's a crisis and he is dealing with it personally. What do you want here? Are you wounded? Or are you bringing food? Medical supplies? I'm sorry, we have nothing. But I've got a patient with me. Perhaps you could... Don't be ridiculous. Have a look around here and in... 800 other cellars in Stalingrad. Without help, they'll die. We are helpless! This is murder. A leader has carried it out, who will go into history... as the greatest German of all times. With his might he held the Eastern front by himself... They talk, and we die. Shut your trap. I've got my orders. If anyone weakens, think of Stalingrad... Eh, give us a drag. Where they have fought with the same heroism... Me too. As in ancient Greece. You don't need it, you're dying anyhow. At Thermopilae, where Leonidas and his 300 Spartans... without flinching till the last of them was dead. As it's written: "If you come to Sparta, traveler..." - Fuhrmann! - Major Linkmann... I told, the cannons, you must... You have to take them off. Old boy. You, oh. It's you Gerd, now I'll be going home soon. So today we speak... At long last I'll play, give concerts... ...to German soldiers... Music. ...who've proven true heroism. They have proven their loyalty to the Führer by dying. - Switch that thing off. - It's Göring. It's our duty to hear it. From now on they'll say "If you come to Germany..." traveler, tell how you saw us lying in Stalingrad... as the law ordered it... Yes, soldiers are meant to die... and if he doesn't, he can only say... I've been lucky once again. Good Lord, how long will he blabber? Switch it off! In 1,000 years, Stalingrad will be pronounced with pride... For the last time, Sargent, switch the box off. I've been ordered to make them hear Göring's speech. Get out! I'll report this. Sure, and tell Göring to save his eulogies till we're dead. I'm sorry, even priests can crack up. We're only human. Did you find what you were looking for? There are no shirkers here. Now, Krämer. Laugh, I've told a joke. Come. Open the door, and run straight on. There are Germans there. - Katja. - Don't say a word. Don't do that. We cannot be friends. We must be enemies. What did this war turn us into? Now go, it'll be too late any minute. Go. Thank you. Don't fire, Krämer. Thank God it's you, sir. We thought you were dead. Did you come back safe and sound? I came back alone. Böse is dead. Böse. - Is Linkmann in his cellar? - Yes. He didn't stick his nose out even once. Is that a way to come in here? Or are you already out of breath? What is it? Böse, too, is dead. So what? I hope he did his duty. No, he didn't. He forgot to spit in your face before he died. Are you crazy? How dare you talk to me like that? You also washed your hands of Fuhrmann. Linkmann, you're not a superior officer. You're a coward and a pig. Another word and I'll shoot you! Do, by all means! Shoot me with all those slogans I myself believed in once! For the last time, stop it! If you've got the guts, come out and fight with our men. And die a miserable death, like they do. Listen, Wisse, you've gone crazy. Be reasonable. We must stick together, we must... Yes, we must climb into the jalopy and flee. Isn't that what you mean? But this time it's too late. Three houses away there are Russians. No, I'm not going to die. GERMAN SOLDIERS! CROSS THE FRONT LINE WITH THIS DOCUMENT THOSE WHO JOIN THE RED ARMY WILL SEE THEIR RETURN HOME GUARANTEED AFTER THE WAR I'm going to sleep. I can't keep on my feet any more. Yes, sir. - What is it? - Something's happening there. The Russians have reached the house on the corner. Yes, a change of position is due. Look at that, I don't believe my eyes! Our major with a white flag. He's not our major any more, but a turncoat and a traitor. Our Army disintegrates fast. We cannot stop it. They fought hard but now... complete units surrender headed by their commanders. Many officers chose to shoot themselves. Our orders reach no one. So, it's the end. Yes. What is it? - This radio message just came. - From Headquarters. Your promotion to Field Marshal. Thanks for being so tactful and not congratulating me. We both know Hitler is asking me to commit suicide. But I won't humor him. I won't subscribe to the legend of guilty General Paulus. That should be borne by others, too. I firmly believed in their promises of help for my Army... and they lied to us, Schmidt... But we can only face ourselves when we are convinced... that our battle was of use to our leaders. That's what I thought too. But at this time... I don't know what I should believe any more. I can't help thinking that enormous errors were made... by each and everyone. Us, too. But it's too late for insight and realization. Get in touch with the Russians. I'm not fighting any more. Yes, General Field Marshal. Come here, all of you. Fighting is over. Our division has surrendered. Our regimental commander, Col. Von Marquart, shot himself. I'm taking you now to the assembly point. Throw away your weapons, you've done your duty. And more than that. I don't know if anyone will ever thank you for it. But that's not important. Come, Krämer. 10,000 assemble, and another 10,000 are coming. They are tired, exhausted, distraught... burned out like the houses around them. Well, gentlemen, here we are. Stay here for the time being. Come, Krämer, let's see what happens now. Hello, Lieut. Col. Wisse. For God's sake, General! Yes, yes, I too got it! We'll take care of you. Thanks, Wisse, but don't bother. We'll give it a try. Krämer, we'll organize something. We'll come for you, General. No, gentlemen, believe me, the one to blame is Paulus. Yesterday the military ideal, today he's to blame. Let's not pretend. Whoever could have prevented this mess and didn't, is guilty. But you, senior officers, you kept your trap shut. We obeyed and demanded obedience. That's the real reason. That was the last car. You could take care of your own men. In Stalingrad fighting is over. The city is covered by fog and red haze. Field Marshal Paulus surrendered to the Russians. He, 26 generals and more than 90,000 men were taken prisoners. The Sixth Army is dead, my Führer. Forget the pathos, Zeisler. It's only an army. Recruit a new one. Almost as cozy as a peasant hut. We only need some sausage. At the time you foresaw that the tire would blow. And so it happened. With great noise and a bang. You must have thought I was very stupid. Only young... What will happen, Reverend? I don't know, but we'll have enough time to find out. - Maybe we'll learn something... - Or maybe not...
