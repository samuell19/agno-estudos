No, no. The picture has to be perfect. Is he deaf or what? - Don't move. You guys may smile. No, no, no, no. You here. And you there. That's much better. Mother and father must be happy too. You guys may smile. - Silent, Frikke. What a weirdo. Where did they find them? He came for free with that camera. - Hurry, otherwise we are late. Is it that time again? - Hurry. Beware! Hey, drunk driver! They should get you off the road, you pirate. Polar cap hooligan. Turbo Clown. - Hi, Eddy. Hi. That was not really his fault. - I was only joking. Frikke. - Bye. Come on. Marko... Shit. All the fault of that photo bungler. Tomorrow you will see her again. - I want to see her today. In love every day is important. - Maybe you should tell her. She sees a guy looking at her for two weeks... ...who does not say a word. I'm waiting for the right moment. - Is that then... ...after she meets a cute guy who does know how to talk? You're not my friend anymore. Frikke? Can I call you tonight for maths? Yes, alright. - Hey up! - Hey! Turbo Clown! Sir. Sir! Hey there. Pikkels. Everything alright? Come on. No, that's mine and Mops. Does Mops still have something to drink? Yes, it is still full. I'm home. Frikke! Hello. - Hi. Do you like it? Yes, what is it? - The cover of a book. Boring book? - No. Okay, yes, a little. How do you know? The more beautiful your covers, the more boring the book. Writers who do not deserve you. Much homework? - Loads. Mommy, Frikke stole Mops her cupcake. - Oh really... What's question 6? - The result of question 6 was 38. 38. And the last one: X is 6. X is 6. There. I've done well again. Wow. What? - I found something... I'll tell you tomorrow. - Okay. Wait, wait. Pikkels, come watch this. (Welcome back... Addicted?) Never played. (Who are you?) Frikke. How did you get this game? None of your business. Want to play this game, Frikke? - Yes. Really play? To the extreme? To the finish... ...Spinach. What is the mission? You'll see. And read the manual. You can still learn something. Bighead. Okay, so with that black box you can take pictures... ...and then load them into the game. Pikkels here, then you can play. Come on, Pikkels. Pikkels, coward. Okay Mops, Look at the birdie. Press the red button. Pikkels, it really works. Hi, Mops. Hello. Unbelievable. And you were scared, big hero. - Mommy, Mops is sick! - What happened? - I don't know. - Mopsi? - Mops? Everything seems normal. She breathes normally. It's like as if she's sleeping. What did she eat? - Cake. Cake. It can't be from the cake, huh Mom? No, sweetheart. Of course not. I'll take Mops, Dorientje. I'll buy another cat, Dorien. From my own money. I want no other cat. I want Mops. Come on, baby. I believe Marie from next door poisoned Mops. - Oh come on... Marie would never do such a thing. - She destroyed my leather ball. You and Marko kicked that against the barbed wire. That was just a small hole. Frikke, we don't falsely accuse people. Understood? Can I go upstairs? And your dessert? Give it to Do. Come on, baby. Help me. Please? You gotta help me. The game has begun, Frikke. You against me. Stop playing and she dies. Tell someone about our game, she dies. Lose the game, she dies too. Understood? Tomorrow, same time. Make sure you're on time. I hate waiting. Another appendix. How you can save her. Suppose we look at a clock. It's eleven o'clock, yes? We look at that clock, we see the image of that clock at eleven. Why we see that picture? Because the image, the light of that image lands on our retina. In theory that would mean that if we look at the clock... ...and we take a few steps backwards... Hurry up, Frikke. - Yes. Damn. That was my last chance. Tonight happens what you have predicted. She meets someone else. And my great love is lost forever. Maybe not. What should I do? Write her a letter. - Now? Just go to her, sucker. I've seen her, didn't I? Or am I dreaming? You've also seen her right? Hi. You okay? I'm hungry. It's been bitten already. - Yes. Also want something to drink? Is it good? - Uh huh . What's your name? I do not remember. Suddenly I was here. I want to go out of here. Back to... I would like to just leave. - Okay, I'll help you. Together we find the exit. Along the way, we must find some kind of code... ...to open the gate at the end. It is not yet clear. - Will we just start? Which way? Pick. - Tell me, how do you see me? Simply, I see you. Yes, but how do I look? You only see my face? No, I do not really see a face in it. Yes... maybe those two O's. - Which O's? In the middle. - What am I? Just a little hat. - A what? A pleated hat of paper. Old paper. A little yellow. I think you're not really a pretty hat, Little Hat. I'm a hat? He wants to go to Australia. There's something inside. A cookie. Probably sent to keep an eye on us. "Fish." We're looking for that? - Yes, possibly. Fish. Can I take this? I find him quite funny. Okay, just pull that camera and antenna from it. Why? They're just in the way. This will definitely be the way? - Yes, I think so too. Shall I go first? Actually, I prefer that you stay behind me. You smell a bit musty. Sorry to say it that way. I have to change that. I don't want to be an old smelly hat. I see a light. Hide! - Why? Because I say so. Hurry. It is cold here. - Quiet. It smells a little musty. Where is that girl now? Girly? Where are you? Girly? What was that? - Someone who cannot find us. Ever. Come on. Little Hat? You must see this. Yes, it is good. We need to search a place to sleep. Cosy. - Yes, and no one can see you here. Sleep tight. Don't you have to sleep? Come on. Sleep tight. Sleep tight. We certainly talked for an hour, Isa and me. I think she likes me. What is that? - Nothing. Certainly now that she needs a good friend. That would be me. Her best friend is in the hospital. According to Isa she's in a kind of coma. They found her like that last night in the park. Poor Isa. Like that... - How does she look like? That friend? - I have not seen her yet. In what hospital is she? - In the St Luke. Frikke? We have to go to school. Frikke! (General hospital St Luke) Nola. I don't have an answer yet. I will discuss it with my colleagues. Right now I'm afraid I can't say what's wrong with her. But do not get discouraged, madam. We're going to run some more tests. Where are you? I want to talk to you. Answer me! Why are you bothering me? This is not our hour of play. Who's that girl? Have you found that? That's smart. Is she the girl from the game? This in turn is stupid. Let her go! - Only you can help her. I'll quit playing! - Find the code and she is free. But stop playing and she dies. You're her only chance. You're going to take away her only chance? I thought so. - Little Hat, wake up. Little Hat? Is something wrong? Little Hat? Little Hat, say something. Come on, Little Hat. Little Hat! I don't want to be alone. Little Hat? Nola. Nola? Little Hat? Little Hat, I thought you were dead. No. I sleep quite solid. Come on. Yes. Why did you just call me Nola? - No reason. I think it's a nice name. Nola. Yeah, not bad. You can keep calling me so, Little Hat. Call me Frikke. - Frikke? Okay Little Hat. - We will get out of here, Nola. I promise. Each one direction? Nothing? - No, it's a dead end. I can hear him. He's coming closer. Little Hat, do something. - Nola, silent. Be quiet. Now. Pekk will catch you. Nola, push the cards. The playing cards. Push the cards. Push! Push! Push them, Nola. Push. Keep pushing. Come on, Nola. Come on, almost. Hurry. Yes, it worked. You failed. Pekk is trump. - Nola, run. I think he is with the black jack. - Little Hat, that was brilliant. What would I do without you? What was on that note? - Lazy. Lazy fish. Lazy fish, lazy fish... Nola. Nola. She is very nice. A little stubborn sometimes. But really fun. Nevertheless, Pikkels? Pikkels? Nola. - Frikke, come on. You'll be late. That is disgusting. - The milk too? What's that now? Everything is immediately rotten nowadays. It is perhaps the thermostat. See you. - See you later. No, come. Give it to me. So given was the straight F as median... ...from vertex P... ...in the triangle P-Q-R. Given was also the straight A as part line for angle Q. The assignment was: search vertex R. How do we do that? We connect vertex P with corner point Q. And the line P-Q. Are we again acting as a clown today, Marko? You can stay Wednesday afternoon at the school circus, in detention. That was a very expensive device. You just can't touch it. - No reason to do that. I was supposed to go to the movies with Isa Wednesday. Our first real date I must cancel now, all your fault. I'll explain it to Isa. - Real friends Frikke, wouldn't do that. Come on, Marko. (Photo Arnolds) Young man. Sir, I'm from the school where you've taken pictures. "You guys may smile." Yes, I have found something. In our attic. It's from my grandfather, I think. Have you ever seen such a device? Wow, never seen it before. It has something of an old Kodak Brownie. But then very primitive. How does it work? Yes. No, the other way around. Yes, like that. Beware! It is rather... delicate. But you don't know anyone with who owns such a device? I wouldn't know who. Okay, sorry. Thanks anyway. Don't you want to sell it? I can put it in the showcase. Perhaps there is a collector or something. No, sorry. It's a family heirloom, So I'd rather not leave it here. Ah yes, your grandfather. Can you take a picture of the device and put it in your window? With my phone number underneath. - Why not? Is that something digital? - Young man... ...that word is not spoken here. I'm a real photographer. Sorry. - I forgive you. Come, put it down. I had an idea at school, Pikkels. Here we started, the corridor with the origami... ...corridor with the maps, dead end... ...corridor with cardboard boxes, there we could go on... ...here are all these newspapers we encountered. Okay, it's a circle. The exit must be in the other half. Which we don't know yet. That's Nola. Well played with the cards. Congratulations. But I also have a surprise for you. Lots of fun. - Nola, we must be careful today. You scare me a little. I hear something. That's Pekk. And he is nearby. Frikke, what should I do? - I don't know. Grab something to hit him with. Aim at his mask. Between his eyes. Don't hit him! Marko? Are you still awake? Frikke? Frikke, where are you going? No, he has not said anything. Okay, yes. I'll keep trying. Bye. Frikke. Frikke, where were you? But boy, you're soaked. Here. Hey... hey. It's Marko. - I have just spoken to his mother. He's in the hospital. Frikke. What is it? I do not know. - Hey. Quiet. Come here. Hey. Quiet, quiet. It's good. It's good. The doctors still have no explanation. There is a girl with the same disease as Marko. Those who wish may, maybe write a card. We can then give it to the parents of Marko. (For sale) Is there any news? - No. Okay. Hello. Hi, Pikkels. "I'm at the printers. Home at seven. Dorien is with Emma. Kiss, Mommy." "P.S. I've cleaned up your room." Oh shit... Not now, Pikkels. You don't hear me? Not now! You still remember. Yes, I'll help you. For the tenth time: I did not want to hit you. If I didn't dive you would have beheaded me. I thought you were someone else. - Who then? That Pekk. Don't know him. - You will soon enough. What is that? That's Little Hat. He helps us. Oh yes, this was in the latest cookie he kicked flat. "Close." - What does it say? That is a kind of code we need to get out of here. Lazy fish... close. Your flying newspaper stinks though. Little Hat, if I'm Nola... ...then who is he? - That's Marko. That's a stupid name. I don't want to be Marko. How do you want to be named then? - I don't know. Something more... ...like a knight. Bedwyr. Or Galahad. Or Gawain or something. It is Marko and it remains Marko. Okay? Wow... That is not real. I had seen long ago. Left or right? Left? Or right? - You decide. - How, how, how. - Little Hat! - Nola. - Let me go! - Let her go. - Let her go! - Little Hat! - Marko, come help! Marko? He has fled. Kuku. - Marko! Marko, where are you? That's me. Hello, beautiful boy. Little Hat, have you seen it? Ouch! Marko? Marko stop playing, we gotta get out of here. No! - Pekk did that? - Yes, it was life or death. You are so brave, Marko. Like a true knight. Don't you think so, Little Hat? And so strong. Does it still hurt a lot? - A little. Poor you. Wait. Is this better? - It was just a small scratch. My hand also hurts a little. - Here? It's much better if you hold it. And I think Pekk also hit me here... - Woo-oow! Is it not time to go to sleep? Come on, Marko. Everything alright? - No, can I lean on you? - Yeah, hold on. Careful. Quiet. Lie down here. - Go lie on this one - Yes. Poor you. Say, Little Hat. Do you have a blanket or something? I have only a sleeping bag. And with two in a sleeping bag... ...that's not really comfortable. - I have no problem with that. That was fast. Good night all. - Sleep tight, Nola. Sleep tight. Yuck. - I'm not leaving until I know how he got that scar. Yesterday he did not have it yet. How did my son get the scratch? - I do not know, the nurse noticed it this morning. We are going to examine it now. - Nurse? - There was no one else inside. Only nurses. We are puzzled. Hello? - Do you sell that photo box? Yes, I do. - How much? - How much what? How much does it cost? 200 Euros. - And that's just for the photo box? There are no accessories? - No, only the photo box. Is 200 Euros too much? - No. Where can I get it? - Is this afternoon Okay? What time? Where? - I'll explain. He can come any time. And now wait until he is tired of waiting. Look. Now, Pikkels. Come on. Pikkels, come back. Follow him Pikkels. His bike. It's him Pikkels. The evidence. You stay here, Okay? Rudolf. - Let go, dirty little thief! - I'm not a thief! You are a murderer. - What? You killed Mops and put Marko and Nola in that game. Oh no. Oh no. Has he put children in that game? You know only too well. - We gotta stop him. Come on. I don't play against you? - No. A month ago, I received a parcel. It contained a USB stick. And a black box. And a note asking me if I wanted to try out this game. Then you know who invented that game. No, the parcel was anonymous. After two minutes, I already knew what he could do with this horrible game. Who invents such a thing now? I pretended I was playing, but I actually kept him in suspense. In the meantime I was busy to find out who he is. And where he is. He is in this city, I know for sure. After a while he began to feel that something was wrong. He did not want to play anymore. He underestimated me a little. I inserted a lock into the prototype game. He cannot play if I'm not logged on. - So... - So... ...by playing... - You reactivated the game. Yes, Frikke... You could not know. Don't be afraid. I have built in a second safety. There's now a code in the game. As long as he does not have it, He cannot reproduce the game... ...he cannot distribute it and he... What? - That's the assignment. He lets me search that code so that he can get out of the maze. He's too smart. Have you found anything? Yes, it's the... Yes, a lot of time to think of something, I had not. And Harry? Harry, wooden duck? Not seen him? Look, I used Harry to hide the code. But also to draw out of the maze. See? Here. The last few days I get nothing more from him. Yes, that's also Pekk. He has pulled off the camera and antenna. Yes? That was to be expected. - We do have a lot more. Don't we Pikkels? We already have at least half of the maze. Of the maze? Can I see that? At my house. - Come. Mama. This is Rudolf. He comes to give me private lessons. - Yes, mathematics. - French. - An hour maths, an hour French. - And an hour French. - Ah. That was unexpected. But I'm happy you arrange it yourself, Frikke. Yes. 'Allez venez, monsieur Rudolf'. 'Au travail'. (Come on, Mr. Rudolf. At work) Oui, oui. (Yes, yes) Hello. Ouch. - He is funny, huh Mom? - Yes. According to me he used an existing maze. I'll check that. But you are also very smart. Wait. Much too smart. - Is that the code? - Almost. - What's missing? - Frikke. You will tell me, won't you? - Frikke I can't tell you. If he has that code, he can do anything with the game. Then no one is safe anymore out there. - I don't care about anything else. - You're kidding right? Then I find it myself. I have also found the rest already. That, I don't doubt. Frikke, there is only one solution. One. We need to know who we are dealing with. Who is the opponent? Where is he? As long as he does not have the code, he won't touch Marko and Nola. - I hope so. - Okay. Have you wondered why he put Marko in that game? - No... - He chose your best friend. - He knows who I'm. - Yes. I'm afraid so, yes. And maybe he will also look closer to home. Your coat, Dorien. - I'll bring Dorien to school. - That's the first time. - You have a deadline. - I would prefer mom. - Come Do. - Mama! Go with your brother. I'll pick you up later. - Do! - I'll go feed the ducks. Mom always lets me. - Okay. But not too long, huh? No! - Hey what you doing! - Jos. Jos! - Sorry. - That's enough! - What did you do? Why did you do that? What are you doing there? Why are you hiding in the bushes? And what is that black box? - Hey. Your mother and Dorien? - Safely home, both. Oh, Okay. - Have you found anything? - No, man. Nothing. Nothing in the books, nothing on the net. No maze is a match. - Rudolf, you have to give me that code. - No, you should not ask me that. You know what happens then. Frikke. I'll call you if I find anything. Okay? Pikkels. We look for that code ourselves, Pikkels. Come Pikkels. We must go here. You know what? Just stay there. But don't complain if you get lost. Rudolf, I got it! I know what the maze is. It is our city. The maze is our city. Okay. Umm... umm... That we should have. Here. Go and see. So... - They are identical. - Yes, look here. - The center from where they left. - Yes. The hospital. - Yes, yes. And here is the triple jump. Here the corridor with the playing cards. - Here Marko joined. - Yes. And this is from yesterday. It just fits perfectly. - That is incredibly good of you. - Yes, but it was actually Pikkels. He found it. Let's see what we have to do now. We must find the exit... ...because if we find the exit, we also know where he is. I think somewhere on the outskirts. Because Marko and Nola are going... ...from the middle towards the outside. - Yes, I will keep searching while playing. No, none of that. Little Hat should stay with Marko and Nola. Otherwise he might suspect something. Yes, but I do know something against that. Just take a rest, Little Hat. You've flown enough. I look ridiculous. You sit there alright? High and dry? - Rudolf? - Yes... - I found the exit. According to the map it's at the "lepen-kaai". - Are you sure? - Yes, Rudolf. Very sure. - I'll go now. - Don't. That's Little Hat. Look, Little Hat. We've met someone else. Oh, no... - He stinks. - I know. But come, follow me. I have found the exit. - All right. - And Pekk? Not heard or seen. But we found this. "Manuscript." So..., lazy fish, close, manuscript. I really have no idea what that means. Come on, this way. - Are you sure? - Yes Marko, quite sure. That is mine. Give me that. My little Jimmy. - That's very deep. - The bridge is strong enough. Go ahead. You go first. - Why me? - We won't miss you when the bridge collapses. - You must... - Nola. It's Okay. Come on. Stupid ninny. - I'm there. - And? Nothing special. The back of a row of houses. I'll call you when I find something. Come on, Marko! You can do it! Do not forget to look down. It is deep. Very deep. Come on, Marko. What that stupid ninny can, you can do definitely. - Come on. It's Okay! Ah. - Marko. - Marko. That was just a joke. Eyes in front, Marko. Straight ahead! Look ahead. You have to go help him. Marko, look at me. Marko, look at me! In my O's. Step. Step. Say man, are you sure it's here because I don't see anything. Nothing abnormal, nothing flashy. - Rudolf. You must find him. Marko was almost... Frikke don't become desperate. Don't. I'll find him. Okay? - We have company! - Marko, you have to run. Come on. Marko, hurry up! - That's wet. - You are going to fall. - Faster Marko! - Fall deep. Faster! Marko! Marko! Hold on. Faster, Marko! Come on. - That's going to be swimming. - You're almost there! Come on. Marko! Marko! Marko, hold. - Climb up. - Come help! Come on, pull yourself up. Climb, Marko. Come on, get out of here. Oh! Meow. Two, three... Photo Arnolds. (Lazy, fish, close, manuscript) Frikke. Frikke! Frikke! - Mr. Rudolf? - Sorry. I need speak urgently to Frikke. - At this late hour? - Yes. An error in the exercise. My mistake. I got the wrong cosine written. If he goes to school with it tomorrow... ...it will be a disaster. Well done, Rudolf. Really well done. - You blew your chances with her. - Rudolf? - If it's so important... - Yes, very much. Here. The photo shop. - We must go to the police. - Wait, wait. No, no. If they believe us, and I say 'IF'... ...they can't just rush into Arnold's shop... ...and things there... - Rudolf. No, Frikke, you cannot. That is the law. We give him also too much time then. He can erase his tracks and deny everything. What then? What is going to happen with Nola and Marko? - Rudolf, we must do something? - Yes. We go beat him with his own weapons. That is 24,99 Euros. - Please, sir. - Thank you. - And one cent back. Please. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And have a nice day. Hello, young man. - Hi, sir. - And? Is your camera already sold? No, no one has called. But I come for something completely different. It's my mother's birthday. As a gift I want to give her a photo of me and Pikkels. - A portrait. - Yes. They say you create the best portraits. Yes, that talent I have, yes. Come on. Come Pikkels. Yes, this one, I think. This is very appropriate. We make something beautiful. Do not move. I think your mom would like to see your eyes. Don't move. Color or black and white? I can't decide. - Take them both. - Yes. Look, I was thinking. Maybe I should better go digital. - It's much easier. Then I can... - Digital is for amateurs. For lazy guys and bunglers. Yes, perhaps. However, it is much easier. I know. Slides. Maybe I should take slides. - 24 shots or 36? - Do 36... No, 24. Sorry, but do you also have 12 shots? Annoying rascal. I've locked the door. They won't bother us anymore. Okay. That is a pretty picture for mom. Smile. Don't move. Attention. Goddamn. - Pikkels. - Stay. Damn... - Naughty dog, Pikkels. Naughty. - You don't hear very well? - You have no business here. Get out! - He normally never does that. - Outside, I said! - And our portrait? - Go to a photo booth. - But Sir, I told you I'm sorry. Out of my shop! Okay. Was it successful? Super. And the other? He didn't suspect anything. Now we wait until tonight. In real life you're as annoying as in the game. Little rascal. If I don't get the code tonight, your friends are dead. Not for long, birdies. Not for long. Yes! Good evening, Sir. A margarita, two pepperoni and five formaggi. That is 108,50 Euros please. A tip is always allowed. - I did not order anything. - You're Arnolds? - Yes, but I did not order anything. - You have called us. The name is correct, the correct address. So you will get the pizzas... ...and I get 108,50 Euros from you. - Take off that helmet... then maybe you can hear me. I didn't order any pizzas. I don't want pizzas! - It's a joke, right? Ordering eight pizzas and then not paying. - As a joke. That doesn't work with me. - Did you hear me laughing? - Take it and pay or I'll call the police. For a free pizza they always come. Rudolf? I'm inside. You can send them to the exit. Finish, terminus. Shit. - Frikke. Now. - Okay Pekk, it's our turn. And we look to the right. What is that? What do I do now? Who turns my head? And there we go. - Stop. Stop! - I don't feel well. - Go! Crikey. Where did you learn to dance? - Goddamn! - He is back. - Little bastard. - Run, run. There. - Now you have to type... I know, Little Hat. I've deciphered it. - Wait a minute. I'm the one that... - Hat, silent. Okay. 'Hic inclusus'. - What does that mean? - Don't you know Latin? Rudolf, are they outside? Because he is almost... inside. No, no. Still the last letters. - Goddamn! - Rudolf? It does not open. Rudolf? I have the code, little bastard and you, I no longer need. Frikke? Boys, get out. Fast. Hurry. No, to the outside. Frikke? Now Rudolf. I've made your portrait... ...Mr. photographer. Frikke? Frikke? Is everything Okay? Frikke? - Frikke answer me. - Yes, Rudolf. - Is everything Okay? - Everything's Okay. - Damn, man. - Everything's Okay. Oh, man. - Doctor. Doctor! Jeez, you have ugly pajamas. Hello? Police. Will you play with me now? Don't close! That I can use. No! Open up. Open the gate. Open the gate. - Whoever is locked here... ...loses his life. - Kasper, come here. - Eddy? - What are you doing here? I don't know. I've slept well. - Does Marko still remember something? - From the labyrinth? - No. Nothing. - Hello... That is perhaps better. - ... Where are you going? - Yes. You were there. I've seen it. Say, Frikke. Would you find it annoying... ...if I occasionally again drop by at your house? For maths? Or for French? Or... for my mother? She loves freesias. Oh, Okay. Hey, good luck. - I'm just sitting here. - Yes, yes. Nothing. She just remembers nothing. Come on. - Little Hat? Why did I just say that? Why do I say Little Hat to you? - No idea. I mean, I do not know you at all. Still, I have a feeling I do. - That's weird. I have that feeling too. We were together at kindergarten or something? Yes, it could. I'm Nola. I'm Frikke. - And that's Pikkels. - Hi, Pikkels. [Song: Photographs by Marble Sounds] ♪ I don't need, nerves of steel. I can resist, a gentle tease. ♪ ♪ If it's a test, I can be tough.
