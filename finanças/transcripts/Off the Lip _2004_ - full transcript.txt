(light ominous music) - [Dave and Kat] This is the ultimate big waves spot. This is Jaws. Why do we call it that? (waves crashing) Could it be the aura death which surrounds this place? Or is there something else? Something about being pulled headfirst into the unknown. (water bubbling) See it like I do now. It's majestic, powerful, awesome. It'll never get out from under your skin.

You take, I'm sorry, is it all right if I film you? - Actually, I'm a little shy in front of the camera. - Oh, I'm sorry. It says here that you're looking for a job as a live-action reporter. - Oh yeah, that's right. But I'm just starting out. - Oh, okay. Katherine Shutte. - Kat, no more Katherine's for me. - Shutte is a Scandinavian? - Northern California, Santa Cruz. - So Kat, you're obviously familiar with the surf scene? - Can I tell you the truth? - [Rick] Please, tell me the truth. - I've never surfed a day in my life and I actually don't even like surfers, I think they're kind of ridiculous. - [Rick] My mother was a surfer. - Oh, well I didn't mean anything against her personally or anything, I'm- - Kat, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, it's a Joke. (Kat laughs) Come on. But seriously though, if that's how you feel then why don't you come to us? After all, we are in internet surf scene. - Well, I think that reporters should be able to tackle any subject no matter how foreign to her own experience. (Rick laughs) - [Rick] All right. Let's see, so BA from BU. - BFA. - [Rick] So have you ever done a documentary before? - Nope. But I know about production assistant work. (static buzzes) - Good. So about a week ago, we started hearing these rumors on the scene about a big wave surfer, a guy, they call the Monk, supposedly the best in the world. I wanna do a feature on this guy. I wanna tie it into the scene, I wanna get a film distributor on board, and then I'm gonna take all that stuff to a major, major cross campaign that's gonna timeout so it coincides perfectly with my surf scene's IPO. The problem is I can't get to him. The people down there, they're just so unwilling to talk. And the people with access, they won't bite. I think I'm gonna have the best luck with someone like you, someone who is fresh and innocent, young, and completely unknown to the surf community. So there it is, that's really it. What do you think? That the nerve center for the entire operation. Dave transmits from here, we'll be tracking you the whole time. Dave? - We've got to state-the-art data center located in a BBN facility with the Cobalt server directly connected to it in T10C1192, a backbone with a 10 gig capacity. I think we're ready to rock and roll. - I need you to sign here for me, right there. Right there. Right there. And on the last page right there. That just the usual protecting my investment in the end. Hey, hey, hey, no, off, off. (static buzzes) This is a 2,500 bucks, it's your per diem. Okay. And then you just sign for it right there. - Okay. - And this is your corporate credit card. And Dave took care of your hotel, it's a very nice hotel, you're gonna be comfortable there. I think we're gonna start you off at three grand. - A month? (Rick laughs) - A week. Is that all right? - God, yes. - We're also gonna have a top surf photographer, he's gonna meet you at the airport, he'll be your guide. - [Kat] Yeah. - And I think that's it. So how do you feel? (Rick claps) - A little overwhelmed. (upbeat music) - [Rick] Be perky. Be independent. Be a MTV. Be sexy. Be daring. (Kat roars) Smile with the camera. (Kat laughs) - I can do it. - You see, that's what I love right there. Authenticity. You love this girl or what, Dave? God, you love my instincts? Here Kat, take this, take the camera. Take it, it's yours. Now go, go, go, go make me rich. (static buzzing) - Hello, hi. - Oh, hey. - I was looking through the elevator? - It's right down there. - So how is he? Rick as a boss? - Oh, Rick's a real visionary. (static buzzes) "Jack London?" I would have figured you for a "Wired" or something. - Well, frontier literature. - He's one of my favorites too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, thank you for the tip. I'll see you around. - Okay. - Probably on the new frontier. Bye. - Bye. - Love, what is it anyway? (bright memorizing music) For thousands of years, the ancients have sought to define it through poetry or song. I intend to make films my parchment, or digital video, anyway. I will use film or the theory of film to document a love, my love, love for the woman I love. The woman I intend to marry. A woman named Kat. Oh, cut it Brian, that's bullshit. Just cut it, cut it, I'm giving you heartfelt, Godard would've wanted ironic. Jean-Luc Godard, you know Godard, right? - [Brian] No. - Jesus. Where did I get you guys. Kat. - Oh Brad, you'll never ever even believe it. (Kat laughs) - Tell me. - You'll be so proud of me. I, who are these guys? - What guys? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. This is Brian, camera, Tito, I got them from the Pep Boys, you'd be amazed how much they have there more than automotive stuff. Go ahead, tell me, how did it go? - Not on the camera. - Don't be shy, they're under your hood, go ahead and tell me. - You're gonna be so proud of me, my friend. - [Brad] Kat, back up. - So I was all ready to take a secretary job or something. - [Brad] Wait, just keep walking, I'm listening, just back up a little more. - Oh, and I asked if I could take a PA job or something, anything. - [Brad] Honey, still further, I'm trying to get a shadow thing on your face there, just keep going back, keep going back. - Well, I leave the day after tomorrow. - [Brad] Wait a minute. No, no, I got the camera package for the whole week. - I'm sorry. - Honey, no, no, no. Back, back, back, this (indistinct) is gonna great. It's gonna be- (Kat shouts) You know, your dad's gonna be furious. - What does my dad have do with this? - Well, he's the one that paid for the rental. Think of it as an investment, something with the chance for return. - My dad is funding your movie. - Yeah. I lied to him, I told him the movie's a romantic comedy. - It's gonna be a kind of style we haven't seen any 20, 30 years, long pans of things that don't relate, actors with their backs to the camera. No sound whatsoever, drops out, nobody knows why. - I'm paying for this? - You know what? I don't think I can be squeamish about a little white lie at this stage of my career. - Right, so you're not gonna fuck me on this, are you? (Martin laughs) - What's the subject of your so-called movie? - The woman I intend to spend the rest of my life with, you. - Oh no. - Yeah. - You're not Hawaii. - Hey Brian, you guys can get off of work, right? - [Brian] Hawaii, are you kidding me? - Tito? - [Vito] It's Vito, man. - I don't care. You're not, nobody's coming to the Hawaii. This is my job, you're not coming to Hawaii, no. - Of course he's coming. - [Kat] But dad. - Look, I spent a lot of money on this. Suction Katherine. - [Kat] It's Kat. - I'm gonna leave the hours from 4:00 to 5:00 open every day and you can call me then, there'll be nothing scheduled. - [Kat] Don't be ridiculous, dad. - If you're going to a foreign country, I would feel much better if I could monitor you. - [Kat] Maui is not a foreign country, it is a state. It's part of the union. - It's a late state.

Yeah Brad. - [Brad] Who's side are you guys on? (Kat laughs) - Long before modern day surfers were towed out on jet-skis past massive breaks to riding the waves of famous surf spots like Jaws. There was a man that the natives called the Monk. Bird spiritual leader, part guru, he blazed a trail for others to follow. Is he a man or is he a myth? A Santa Claus for surfers or a local legend from a bygone day who has maintained his purity throughout it all. - That was great. - [Kat] You think? - Yeah. Look directly into the eye of the camera. - Like this? - Yeah. (Dave laughs) Yeah, like that. - Dave, Dave, Dave? - Also, there was a little interference at the beginning of the transmission. - Oh, that's Brad. - Oh hey. Sorry pal, no harm intended. Yeah, you're great. - Yeah, could you lose him? He is right for the image, it's just perky, dependent. - I guess a better thing twice about marrying him then. Dave? (static buzzes) Hello?

So where are we exactly? - This is Aloha classic, man, Maui's been kind, the best wind surfing anywhere. - But I thought the Monk was a big wave guy? - Yeah, he is, he's legendary, he's the best ever, best ever will be. In fact, they say one time, his entire beach house got sucked out there by a tsunami, he ripped off a piece of the roof, he rode it back in. Another time, there was this little Cessna airplane flying a couple of tourists around, crashed. It was in the morning, the Monk was the only one out there. He paddled out, the pilot was deceased unfortunately, the honeymoon couple was alive, he put them on the back of his board. He put the leash around his neck, paddled them in to safety. Set them ashore, walked away, never said a word. - [Brad] That's ridiculous. - Oh, for you or me, yeah. Not for the Monk. - So where he is he?

I'll find the Monk. - I wouldn't talk to those guys. (upbeat music) (waves crashing) - Talk to the lens. - The Monk, he's just folklore. - The Monk, you believe that? - Is this is a student film or what? - God, some people are so rude. - [Brad] Brian, the pan with the blonde.

(car engine revving) - Hey, you see that cove over there? The Monk used to trap sharks in there and then he'd wrestle them just to entertain the village children. - All right, you can cool it with the legend stuff, Lenser, the Monk doesn't exist, I know, I figured it out, it's all bullshit. (Brad laughs) - Wrong, you're bullshit. - [Kat] Hey do you know the Monk? - You mean Jerry Garcia? - I'm looking for the Monk. Hey, this is Kat Shute for Off the Lip. - Fucking media, Jerry's not dead. (car engine revs) - Are you looking for the Monk? - Look, I have a little dog named the Monk. - Hey, it's Kat Shutte, Off the Lip, what's up? - Jerry faked his death and went underground here on Maui as the Monk. - Whoever meets the goanna, must fuck the goanna, it's our religion. - This is probably not the right lead. Okay, moving on. - There'll be no meeting of goanna, There'll be no fucking of goannas, this is my fiance. - Look. (Dave laughs) - [Brad Hey, you think you pull over for a second? - Not everybody survives the Ahona highway, sorry. - I'll survive. (upbeat music) (car engine revs) (pukes loudly) - Oh man. The road does that to some people. - He's a nice guy, believe me, he's not at his best right now. - Yeah, it happens. He's probably just tense. - You never seem to get tense. - Oh yeah, I get tense. Why do you think I came to Maui? - I don't know, why did you? - Well, I saw some heavy shit in Granada. (Kat laughs) - It's hot out here. - Oh yeah. Keep going. - Take that. (water splashes) - How's the water? - Did she just jump in, in her panties? (Brad sighs) Anyway, it's me. - [Che] You mean ma? - No, no, no. Dogma, it's pronounced dogma, it's Danish. - [Che] So it's probably the same word, meaning an arrogant declaration of opinion. - [Brad] Yeah. - [Che] Like the church, laying down a central tenant. - Yeah. - [Che] Or like the dogma of Marxism, that postulates class identification between all workers, regardless of their individual loyalties. - Well, that too. - Which is why I hate dogma, it represents things in black and white, which life never is. - Where'd you go to school, Che? - I'm a self-educated Jeffersonian. And the name is Che. (singing foreign language) (water splashes) - [Lenser] Around here there's a (in foreign language) we could try, she's like a spiritual leader in the community. - I've seen the Monk. - [Kat] Really? - Many times in my dreams. - [Kat] What does he look like? - Like a blinding flash of light. (graphics whooshing) When you see this massive figure rise through their cross of that 60 foot wave, this is like a ghost of another time made flesh. There is an island, some say, invisible to the eye without faith. It can be seen at sunrise and sunset, and sometimes it floats overhead and you can reach up and touch it with your fingertips. And here on this island, lives the Monk, there you will find him. You will find him. You'll find him. (static buzzes) - I swear to God, wherever you are, I will track you down. As God is my witness, I will find you, Monk, I will find you, I will find you. - Che, you're in the shot. Che, Che, get out of the shot, would you? Get out of the- (Che shouts) No. (Kat shouts) (water splashes) That's not my fault, that's not my fault. Brian, can you get the camera over there? Please be careful. Oh God. Brian, can you see? Oh Che. Can you see? - [Lenser] Bummers, bra. - [Brad] Is there anything, nothing, not a shoe? Was he wearing shoes? - [Lenser] That might be a shoe over there. Might be a sea turtle head, it's hard to say. (singing in foreign language) - Please bless and guide all of these people until you're knowing ways. And most of all, please bless their new sound man. - Cool. - The name's Mee. - Sorry, Mee. (in foreign language) That was terrific. - Ole, please no, this is for all of you. And for you (in foreign language). - Why'd you do that? - What? - I think you just really offended her. - Oh, come on. It's only two bucks, but it's a gesture. (upbeat music) - Sorry you couldn't bring Brad. - [Kat] He'll get over it. - You got to understand the locals around here don't want a million tourists tramping around. Outsiders is are strictly (in foreign language). This is Jaws. (in foreign language) is what the locals call it. This is the ultimate spot, man, it's completely outrageous. - It's totally flat. - Well, yeah, it's kind of flat today, but when it's pumping, when you got those Northwest coming through here, it is freaking spooky. You get into the zone, you know what I'm saying? And you got like a 60 foot wall of water on your ass and the sound is just deafening. (waves crashing) It's like you got a train in your brain or something and it's like you're out there with some sort of an animal, some huge prehistoric water beast, and you're going there with it, you're just going with it. And you can't even think about it because it's doing the thinking for you. You don't have a choice, you're just trying to stay alive and be part of that thing. And it's like Hoover Dam just broke, and everybody's getting electrocuted and you're riding that wave and you don't care 'cause you don't have time. It's Jaws man, you just hope you don't get chomped. (announcer speaks faintly) I could have been a monster surfer, have my own sort of style, but I just, I don't know, I got scared. Just got scared. - It's really beautiful here, thanks for bringing me. - You're welcome. - Even if it is flat. - It just feels like we've gotten off track is all. - What do you mean? - Kat, I love you and I need you to make this film. And I guess I'm just feeling a little insecure and I need some reassurance. - Would a blowjob make you feel better? (Brad sighs) I'm not gonna say that, but it wouldn't hurt. - That's what I thought. - Wait a minute- - Guys, I think I got a lead on some film of the Monk. - [Kat] Really? - Yeah, seriously, but we're gonna have to move like now. - [Kat] Okay, okay, we're going. (upbeat music) - [Brad] This is like that film, that Coppola thing, "Hearts of Darkness." Mee, you know that movie? - What movie? - You got to know that movie. - "Apocalypse Now," he's talking about. - Mee, where does that name come from? - It's Hebrew, it means who? - Who means Mee? - That is fucking deep. - "Hearts of Darkness." Oh yes. - There she is. - [Kat] Wow. - [Brad] So who is this guy again, Lenser? - He's a great, great grandson of some plantation boss. And the thing is he's a little bit a- - Aha, another freak. - Yeah, but he's trustworthy, a hundred percent. He's not gonna like these cameras up. - Who, you and Brian just stay here and shoot this way. It's Mee. - You put this in your bag, and just set it up and he'll never even know it's there. - A hidden camera. (Kat coughs) Geez, this place stinks. - Just don't breathe - Come on. (Kat shouts) You must be McReady. - You Kat? - You got the stuff? - You ready to trade? - I got 5,000 right here. - [McReady] You said 25. - I need to save some cash. - Yeah, well fuck that. Hey, if you don't want what I got, Y'all can just move right on. My great, great granddaddy got marooned in paradise because he was a mutineer walking around Honolulu with 15 cents in his pocket. But I'll tell you something, by God, he was a man. Do you know what that means to be a man? A real man, huh? Huh? Huh? How about you? Do you know what it's like to be a man? You don't know what it's like to be a man, do you? Just 15 cents in your pocket and yet you are still able to grab a whole country by the back and just ride. He's riding the whole country at once, at the wheel driving, I got you now, white man in charge. (McReady grunting) Squeal like a pig, squeal for me country. (Lenser squealing) Yeah? No, you don't know what that's like. You don't know. (upbeat tribal music) I don't either. (McReady cries) - [Lenser] It's okay for a real man to cry, right? (static buzzes) - This is the link between what was and what can be. The Hawaii's call him the Monk, but the Hawaiians call him (in foreign language). (McReady growls) My tutu mama took me by the hand at the tender age of 10 down to the shores of Peahi. And she said, I want you to see what it means to surf the big ones. (waves crashing) And that's when I saw my gambling debts are barking louder than my conscience is right now. - This is the film of the Monk? - The one and only version existing anywhere. - [Kat] 22, 23, 24, 25. - Thank you very much. God bless this country. - Thank you so very much. (McReady shouts) Brad, roll projector, please. - [Brad] Yes ma'am. - Drum roll, gentlemen. (tapping knees) And now the moment that you all been waiting for, the face behind the name, the Monk. (Brad and Lenser cheering) (videotape rolling) - Oh, that's so beautiful. (Kat shouts) - This is unbelievable, do you see that? No one can do that. - Give me a break, it depends on the wave. - He is just ripping, go, go. - [Brad] Hold on. Oh shit. - Wait, what are you doing? Brad, what are you doing? - Turn it off, man. Shit, man. - Don't touch it. Don't touch it. (screen burns) Oh my God, what is happening? (screen burns) Oh boy, well, maybe there's stuff in the middle is salvageable, but the rest of this is, with all the silver nitrate in this old film stock, it's very lucky, the whole place didn't go up in flames. - You should've just left it alone. Would been so easy to transfer to video. - Wait a minute, we all wanted to watch it together. We all wanted to watch it. - Don't, okay, just don't. You're a filmmaker and you should've known about this. - What the hell does this film have to do with I being a filmmaker? - [Lenser] You know what? I'm just gonna step out. - [Brad] Take it easy, man. - I'm sorry. - [Lenser] I'll see you later. - [Kat] See you tomorrow. - [Lenser] Okay, okay. - Listen, I don't think we should let this get in the way- - Oh, get out of my face. - The Italian say never go to bed mad. - [Kat] You know what? I'm not Italian. (waves crashing) - I'll take a pay cut. - Oh no, it's not your fault, seriously, forget it, you're doing a great job. - Thanks. Is that a rake? - We're in Rick's garage. He out right now talking to some more venture capitalist about another three mil for this year's budget, you can't show a profit if you wanna make a killing. I actually haven't seen him in a couple of days, but he'll be back soon. - [Kat] Well, what happened to the office? - Oh, Rick said that office was stifling our creativity. - It's been a little tough around here lately. - This is Kat Shutte for Off the Lip, we on our way to a Lahaina, a popular tourist destination. And according to our hotel security guard, a possible home of the Monk. - Actually, it was me who got the tip. - Brad, please, I'm doing a report. (upbeat music) (engine steaming) - Oh man. This blows, I just re-taped this hose about four days ago. (engine steams) - Nice job, I hope it worked. - How far is it to the Lahaina? - About 10 miles. - Why don't you guys go hide in the lone fields? I have an idea, go. Brian, you too. - [Brad] Brian, get down, get down. Here comes a car. (car engine revs) - Hey, can I hitch a ride? Come on you guys. - You gonna be fine here just by yourself with the car? - I'll be fine. - Great, we'll see you back at the hotel. You're a real sport, Who. - It's Mee. - You guys ever see Contempt? You know the Godard? Well, he would've loved this. All about reality, capturing reality, the reality of the capture. - [Kat] So you have heard of the Monk? - Oh, the Monk, yeah, he's the coolest, him and cool drink are the best. - Excuse me miss. Excuse me miss. - [Kat] Yes. - You drive an 89 black Jeep? - That sounds like my car, is there a problem? - I'm sure I tied the boards up on the car. Big, huge gust of wind comes up. Boom, plenty boards flying through the air, cuz, my brand new surf board- (local man hits) goes right through this guy here. $400 for nothing now, nothing. - Whoa is Mee. - Gnarls. - My condolences. - Yeah. - Fuck it, I quit. - Brian. Wait no- - Fuck you, Brad. - Wait, no, no, you cannot quit, Brian, you call yourself an artist? - [Brian] Fuck off. - Amateur. He's an Amateur. Sorry Who. - It's Mee. It's Mee, he's name is Mee. God. - I feel terrible. If I hadn't pushed so hard, maybe if I hadn't wanted it so badly, Che, Who, Tito would still be with us. On the other hand, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs and what kind of artist would I be if I just gave up? What would their lives have meant? They would've wanted me to continue. Sex and death is like a potent combination. - Jesus Christ, don't you ever get enough? - What are you talking about? We're in like the most romantic island on earth and we've only done it like three times. - Is that all that this relationship is to you? (knocking on the door) - I'll address that question when you get back. - [Rick] Kat. - Rick. It's my boss. Stay in here, you're not supposed to be here. Be quiet. - [Rick] Wow, didn't realize that I was paying for a full suite. - [Kat] Well, that's how you booked it. But if it's a problem, I can- - [Rick] No, hey, come on, it's no problem, money is no option when we looking for the Monk. Is that the terrorist right there? Let's go out there. Wow, that's not a real Picasso, is it? Nah. Listen, come on out here, I got to ask you something. Hey, I'm sorry that, I just didn't feel comfortable in there. Prying ears, lot of people wanna find out where the Monk is. - So what's up? - We spotted the Monk in Southeast Asia. - Southeast Asia? - Yeah. Me and Mar, just formerly Burma, the king and I, (indistinct) and all that- (Rick mumbling) The point is, do you have your passport on you? - Yeah, yeah. - Great. I knew a kid like you would come compared. Do me a favor, go get it for me, will you? - Okay. - Okay. - Great. Good, I'm gonna go to the airport now, I've got to pick up our tickets. - Why do you need my passport? - For the visas. - Oh. - Yeah, you need a visa to get there. So a friend of mine works in the consulate in Oahu, who's gonna grease the whole thing. So there it is, tomorrow morning 10 o'clock, just pack your bags and I'll pick you up. - I have run out of my per diem. - Oh, no problem. Let me, oh, you know what? This is my last 100, I need it for the limo. - Okay. - Tomorrow when I come I'll bring a lot of cash 'cause we gonna need it for the trip. Uncle Rick is gonna take care of everything. All right. - Thank you. - [Rick] Okay. (Kat sighs) (Kat chuckles) - Would you turn that off? Turn that off. (static buzzes) - Yes, Burma, Burma. B-U-R-M-A. These idiots are telling me there's no Burmese consulate in Honolulu. I'm gonna call you back. Silly. Listen, I think Rick won't mind if I tag along. So long as I pay my own way. I guarantee, I can find it very cheap Burmese crew. I'm gonna miss you guys. Even you, Bradford. - Oh, Lenser, I'm not so sure I'm gonna miss you. (Lenser chuckles) - It's half past noon, where is Rick? - [Lenser] Yeah, he owes me money. - [Kat] He owes me money too. - I'm sorry, this credit card's not going through either. - This doesn't even have a balance on it. - Could you try it again? It should work. Thank you. - We should probably eat pretty fast. - Yeah, yeah, I'm in Maui, but I did not take out a $10,000 cash advance yesterday. Are you listening to me? No, that is what I'm asking you. I don't have an American Express card number because I don't have an American Express card. No, I'm sorry to be talking to you in this voice. No, don't don't transfer, no, no. I owe $150,327 and some cents. They said I signed an application. It must have been at the office, those employment papers. And he signed himself in as a co-signatory and now he's left the country with my passport and I'm liable. - They'll sort it out, you'll see. Look, I might have to lay low for a little while. The feds came by. - The feds? - Yeah, they were looking for him, apparently he's been laundering money for a Colombian drug cartel and came up a few hundred grand short. - How stupid, how could I do this? I knew this job was too good to be real. - Look, the job might not be real, but the Monk is real. You have to find him, people are counting on you, people are rooting for you now. - You're actually getting hits? - Over a hundred thousand last week. And I got a call from a magazine offering 50 grand for an exclusive once you find him and a photo shoot. - I can't do that. I'm not that desperate. No, not of you, of the Monk. - Where are you, anyway? - The downtown library. I can't go back to the office, it's too hot. Are you gonna be okay? - No, but I'll talk to you later. (static buzzes) What are you filming the boat for? - [Brad] Product placement, honey. Mama said she'll give us some fish on the house. I told him we work for the exploratory channel. Pretend like you're exploratory. Yes. - Thank you. - Compliments of Mama's Fish House. - Thanks very much. (static buzzes) (Kat sighs) - With all that's gone wrong today, at least I have you. - Kat, I got a call from Boston, they want me to go back there. - I thought you gave that up. - I did, I did. Well, the guys at the station at K Cam, they got a great opportunity to do a bunch of promotional spot like public service announcements for child safety. So it's a good cause. And then the money is not much, but I can use it, I can use it to make my film, not this film, but the film that I told you about, the one about the dying of mother earth. - [Kat] Well, I can that. - You can see that? - [Kat] Yeah. (Brad chuckles) - Wow, I'm glad. I mean, I thought you were gonna be really mad. - God no, why would I be mad? - Well, I have to leave today. I have to leave soon. - [Kat] You have to leave today? - Yes. - [Kat] But what about the Monk? - Oh, you'll find the Monk, I have confidence, I have faith, you'll find him, Kat, you don't need me. - Brad, I do need you, you can't leave me right now. - Kat. What about the movie? What about our movie? - I got them here, this is all of it, this is everything that we shot since we came to the island, including the bedroom stuff. And I want you to have it or your dad to have it and tell him I said thank you and I'm sorry, it just got away from me. It was not my film anymore, I had a vision and then people blew up and fell and stuff. - [Kat] You're leaving me. - I'm not leaving you. I'm not. I'm not. I mean, yes, I'm leaving you, but I'm not leaving you. - You're an asshole. Fucking take your tapes. (Kat cries) Shit. - It's just a job, Kat. - Yeah, we'll see. - Can you give me a ride to the airport? (drink splashes) - Reporters journal. - [Dave and Kat] Remember I wrote about those idiots we look forward to believe in? - Well, Brad is example (in foreign language), a pathetic king without a kingdom, but you know what? I'm starting to feel okay that he bailed on me. Asshole. (static buzzes) My key. - [Hotel Assistant] Yes, how can I help you? - It doesn't seem to be working. - Oh, one moment, please. Katherine Shutte? - Yeah, that's me. - I'm afraid, I'm gonna have to ask you to settle your bill. - I will, it's being taken care of by the company. - Apparently not. (Kat chuckles) - Well, there has been a huge mistake. - Yes, I'm afraid there has your bill is rather substantial. You're gonna have to come with me, please. - No, get your hands off of me. - Let's not make it serious. - What's your name? - Is that a camera? - What's your name? - Is that camera on? - [Kat] Yeah. - You shut the camera off right now or I'll call security. Redolpho. Redolpho. (bright music) - [Dave] Reporter's journal. - [Dave and Kat] What hap&pens when white kids who come from wealthy homes fall on hard times? (static buzzes) - [Kat] The rescue boat comes and you hate yourself for jumping on board. - [Local Man] Hey, Hawaii girl, where you going? - [Dave and Kat] But not me, I refuse to give up. I won't do it. (static buzzes) (knocking on the window) - Hey Kat, come on in. Hey, what's going on? - [Kat] Brad dumped me. - Ouch, wow. Sit down, have a Mai Tai. - I'm not complaining, plenty of people have it worse off than me. It's like you have your national disasters and your local disasters, and Brad was just your complete domestic disaster. I never really had any belief in myself, like to think I could do something or mean something to someone on my own terms. (birds singing) - [Lenser] It's a pretty place, isn't it? I always come up here when I wanna think. You look really nice in this light. - Thanks. (bright music) (Kat laughs) - Hi mom and dad. - Hey mom and dad. - I went to Hawaii, and I got was this lousy surfer. (Lenser laughs) - Sorry. Better than a T-shirt. (Kat laughs) - What are you thinking now? - Oh, all that stuff I was telling you about the Monk, about wrestling sharks and pulling the honeymoon couple out of the surf and all that stuff. Well, I'm not sure all that stuff really ever happened. See, when Rick called me, offered me this gig, I was really, really hurting for cash, so I said, yeah, okay, whatever, this a job. But then when you came along, you believed so much and I didn't wanna stop you from believing, it seemed to mean so much to you. - Are you saying that he doesn't exist? - I'm saying I don't know. I'm just a guy, takes pictures of surfers. The Monk's never been found because the Monk doesn't wanna be found. I just don't want you keep getting hurt. (waves crashing) (water bubbling) Wow. I look at you and I can't believe we slept together. You're so pretty. Anyway, it's that time of day, dawn patrol, I can hear the surf breaking from my here, it sounds like a monster swell. I kind of wanna get out there, shoot some of it. I've been up since our talk last night, I had some time, I wrote a poem, maybe explain things a little better. (Lenser sighs) Shark-a-baby. I fall upon your coral, scraped and battered, scarred and shattered with all hope dashed being with you again. Crest of you as far too steep, fate never meant for us to meet, on this Emerald isle we took a trip and now I've fallen off the lip. Goodbye, Kat. (waves crashing) (phone beeps) (water bubbling) - They really did a great job on these stations. - [Kat] Dave. - What? - There are no hits are there? It's only you, isn't it? - I'm telling you Kat, if you find this guy, there will be. You'll make it, I swear. - Why are you staying with this? Why do you even give a shit? - Just promise me you won't give up. Kathy, promise me you won't give up. - Okay. - And I'm sorry about, you know. I wouldn't start a new relationship just yet. - There's nothing going on with me in Lenser. - Really? Oh, I mean, I didn't mean to, it's so personal, it gets a little quiet on this end sometimes. - You are looking kind of pale. - I haven't slept much. - Funny, neither have I. I wonder what Jacqueline would have thought of this. (water bubbling) (upbeat music) - Hi sweetheart, can I get something for you? - I could definitely use a drink. - What would it be? (balls clashing) - Honey, you can't sleep here. - Where's (indistinct) when you need him, I can't believe it. - Hey, sorry. - [Drunk Man] You coming out with us? (static buzzes) (torch flicks) - Don't you dare, give that back to me. Give it back. It's not yours, give me back my camera. Give it back. Get the hell out of here. Okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. (Kat cries) I wanna go home. - Welcome to where I spent my night, it's not the Maui that you see in advertisements, it's a possible home of the Monk, your amid the debris of the 20th century, it would be somehow fitting. This is Kat Shutte On the Wire, and Off the Lip. (static buzzes) - Miss Shutte, FBI. - Oh my- - You said you have no prior knowledge? - No, I told you this all already. - I realized you made use of your passport to flee the country. Yes, and I had no idea that he was going to do that. - Wasn't he your lover? - No, definitely not. - You ever have a criminal record? - I did not do anything. - [Martin] Hello? - Dad. Hi. - [Martin] Kat. - It's Kat. - [Kat] How are you? - Not so good. - I heard a rumor, you're looking for the Monk. - Where'd you hear? - Word travels. He's in Lanai. (static buzzes) - [Kat] I'm sorry. - [Martin] Where's the tears, usually lots of tears? - [Kat] Dad, right here, right now. - [Martin] A criminal, I have a criminal in my family. - [Kat] I made a mistake, I'm sorry. - [Martin] You made the last mistake you're gonna make. Airport please. - [Kat] I have to go find the Monk. - [Martin] Are you insane? - [Kat] Dad, that's ridiculous- - Come on, we're going home. - -he's not dealer. - [Martin] He's a surfer. If he's a surfer- - [Kat] Wait a second. - [Martin] No, you can take off, we're leaving. - Do you understand what's going on here? - If he's a surfer, he's a drug dealer. It's a simple equation. - Do you understand what I'm going through? - How else do they pay for their lifestyle? - Listen to me please, dad. - Drugs. - Dad, do you understand what I'm going through? This is about you and me, it is about you and me. - Nothing to do with me. - Do you know why I was dating Bradley? - I have no idea. - He's like you. - Thank you, that's great to hear. - He is like you, he is you, but he's not you- - Thank you, honey. - -you're you, no one could be like you. You are so strong and fearless, and you know you don't give up? - Please. - Hold on one second. - I'm a small man in the big picture. - [Kat] Do you remember Mrs Rosenthal? Do you? - Of course I do. - [Kat] Do you remember that now? - What's that got to do with anything? Please. - Nobody would go near that mouth, but you- - It was a horrible mouth. - You went through that mouth, you did it. - I went where man would go. - [Kat] And what happened? - Bacterial endocarditis. - [Kat] She's now eating apples now, isn't she? - Crispy apples, I know, it's true. - The Monk is my Mrs Rosenthal's mouth. - Really? All right. - Please do this for me. - Okay, all right. You're making a sense, if you make sense, I'm a sensible man. That's all I'm asking. - Thank you. - Come on, come on. Where the hell is the Lanai? Oh my God, a checkered helicopter. What? First third of mile, $2000. Oh my God, I hate these things. Really, this is a huge psychic price I'm paying here, honey. I'm willing to do it. Let's go up. (Helicopter chuffing) - [Dave] Reporters journal. Sunlight, new hope. (bright music) - [Dave and Kat] Getting arrested was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I know where the Monk is. I've convinced my dad to come with me. - [Martin] No. (Martin shouting) Where did you learn to drive this thing? - [Kat] How can you hate and love someone so much at the same time? (Martin shouts) Well, for some reason I needed him here, maybe only so he could see me in my moment of triumph. - Okay, great. One, two, three, four, five, six, $700. - $700? - Yeah. - A tip would be appreciated. - Well, okay. - Helps to motivate the return trip. (Martin laughs) - I was gonna give it to you. I was just testing you. You don't have to nail me with your brutal logic. - Thank you, sir. - Sure, fine. I hope I tipped him enough. (helicopter chuffing) There's a lot more money where that came from. We'll be right here. Hello? I'm losing you. No, I'm losing. I'm losing. Nope. I got no reception. Katherine. Katherine, turn the damn thing off. Don't film this. - [Kat] Dad, my name is Kat. - Look, do you know how many appointments I've canceled to do this for you? I mean, this is ridiculous. I mean, Mrs Martin is sitting there, Mrs Martin with a frontal occlusion, looks like Eleanor Roosevelt. And I got to work on this lady, her husband, gums completely inflamed. You know what that's worth to me? You know how many hours that is? How many gum hours that is for me? A lot, that's what it is. And we'll use a rubber tip? - No, won't do it. Where are we going? Which way are we going? Is it possible for the humidity to get above a hundred percent? Is that like physically possible? This way? Oh, you're kidding. Oh, come on. Oh God. Oh God. Okay, whoa, whoa, dinky, dinky. (static buzzes) (Kat laughs) All right, okay. No, we're going home. That's all. (static buzzes) It's gonna stabilize, I'll be right there. You just shut up. (intense music) - [Kat] What I don't understand is why you never believed in me? - I believe in you. - [Kat] No, you don't. - Oh, come on. - [Kat] The fact of the matter is, you're more willing to finance my ex-boyfriend's stupid filming than you are in my future. - Look, just let us be parents, we're imperfect damn it, for heaven's sakes. Right? - [Hawaiian Thug] Hey. - Oh, geez. - What you doing on my property? - Look, just relax, I will take care of this. Oh, they got a machete and a gun. Just move, run, come on. Honey, don't- (Kat screams) - [Hawaiian Thug] Hey, check this out. - Oh, yeah, cuz, some cherry camera. - Look, we had no idea this was your drug field. - You're right, you had no idea. - No, please, don't kill us. - [Hawaiian Thug] I'll smash this. - No, I'm making a documentary. - [Hawaiian Thug] On drugs? - Surfing. - [Hawaiian Thug] Well, sister, you just got totaled. Ow, my fucking tooth. Fucking tooth. - Are you in pain? Okay, a little wider. A little wider. (Hawaiian thug shouts) A little pressure on this side then. And we're going to get this. (tooth pops) Yeah, yeah. (Martin laughs) There you go. - Owie. - Owie, huh. Hey honey, got it. Now look, this was your own fault, my friend, a little oral surgery early on, it's got impact, you can't let that happen. I want you take one of these for breakfast, one after dinner, and one or whenever you want to, for pain. And did you know that a distinguished medical journal has reported that cannabis can be highly effective in treating many patients for pain? - No shit? Yeah. - How you feeling? - No pain. - Well, you're gonna hurting tomorrow. (laughs loudly) (in foreign language) - Aloha, my brother. - [Martin] Aloha. (in foreign language) - [Kat] I didn't know you smoked. - Yeah, I was a kid too, a long time ago. Oh, I feel so tingly. Everything feels tingly. You wanna feel tingly? (Kat laughs) - [Kat] No, dad. - I feel like tingling. Oh my whole body, I haven't felt like this for a long time I can tell you that. - [Kat] You're so cool like this. - Yeah. No more vodka, you know what I mean? (Kat laughs) Vodka, uh-huh, uh-huh, no, no. No more vodka, not for me. (bright upbeat music) (waves crashing) (water bubbling) Hey, this cam is cherry, bra. - Dad, finished? We're here. So would you act cool and try not to shake the camera. - [Martin] Yeah. - Let's try to blend in. Where's the Monk? What's going on? Where's the Monk? - [Boner] So you heard? - [Kat] Heard what? - [Boner] He's dead. (light somber music) - Hey Kat. Hi. I tried to get ahold of you at the hotel, they said you already checked out. McReady here got a hold of me. - I read about it on Yahoo. But by the time we got here, it was already too late. - He was out there on those waves, just cutting across them. - Ride back and forth, in and out, teasing them. - He's like a bull fighter on top of his game, just in tune with the elements. - It wasn't the biggest wave we've seen. - It wasn't the smallest either. - But it took his life. - The Monk. - Last of the pure thing in these islands. - Besides those waves, to which he has returned. - Hey, let's have a moment of silence. - To me, the wave is like tooth. A wave is rooted in the ocean just like a tooth is rooted in the gum, and at the place where they meet, that's a coral, there rises white, brilliant, inexorable, a tooth, and we ride it, we ride it, and we ride it. And it wears a way and it wears a way until finally it falls peaceful upon the shore. - That is so fucking beautiful. - I'm flossing every day, no skipping, man. Yeah, and those little gum things too. - Rubber tips. - Yeah, me too, twice a day. - I just happened to have some samples. - [Boner] Come on, give me. - Thank you. Oh man, that feels really good. Can you feel that? - It feels great, just great. - It's stimulating. - Well see, that's the blood coursing through the gums. - Yeah, I can feel it, is there supposed to be this much blood?

(Martin claps) (bright music) (singing in foreign language) (flute blares) - I guess it doesn't matter what you try for or what you believe in, it'll all get shot through with bullshit in the end. (guys cheering) Nothing's pure in the world anymore. Nothing worth trying for or believing in. (light music) I might as well go back home, be a secretary in my dad's office, pay him back, go back to school, get a practical degree, find a husband, have two kids. Love them. Get old, be mad at myself for getting old. Feel like there was something that I should have done and didn't. Get sick and think about how I spent my whole life never even thinking that death was a possibility. (waves crashing) I think about the Monk, at the height of the wave, where the sea comes crashing into land and the power of a person standing on something impossibly strong and not dying, but riding it, it becomes not a dream or an illusion, but something real. And I know that I will dream of the waves. And at the time of my death, I'll dream of them still. Maybe see myself on them. Thinking that maybe that's something I should have done and didn't. (singing foreign language) (static buzzes) - This has been a fantastic trip. I mean, a fantastic trip. Fantastic. And don't worry about the credit card thing, you can come back and work with me on the office, that'll be nice? Dad working on the toothies. Katherine up in the office. You're good, honey, you're good. And in the fall, you can re-enroll in school, Pepperdine Dental School, Pepperdine Dental School will be glad to have you, after all it is (indistinct). We can start over there. What a guy. What a guy. We'll put this all behind us. Kind of life plan out, feel smooth, get it straight. That's the best way. So you know the future, I hate not knowing the future, makes me nervous. I hate being nervous. Oh, damn, these nuts are good. Oh, I gotta save some for your mother. And we'll brush our teeth on the plane. (Martin shouting) Where are you going? Kathy, where are you going? Where are you going?

I intercepted the mailman before the FBI got to it though. (static buzzes) I'd like to thank the Honolulu Police Department, Alma Kriegel, vacationing in Maui with your newlywed husband. The Shutte family, of course, and all the others who contributed all their footage to make this film what it is. Yeah. So on a personal note, Kat, if you see this, please contact me. This is my home number, actually it's my dad's number, but he knows how to get ahold of me. Okay, all of those, if you in the law enforcement, doesn't mean he knows where I am now. (static buzzes) And all your friends out there on the internet, Kathy. (police sirens blaring) Shit. Kathy, if you haven't already figured this out, I love you. I can't believe I said that, it's actually not so bad, I love you. I dream of you I love you.
