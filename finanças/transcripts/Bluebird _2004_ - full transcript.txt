Hello... Is this yours? Yes Thank you. 5.5... Please pay attention: the comparative of "bon". That isn't "plus bon"... We'll run through it. Thys: 7. The ladies at the front. The same mark, the same mistakes. How strange. Martijn... Put that away. And watch what we're doing. Number four, everyone... You didn't do it right. What could it mean? Think of the verb "jouer". Drumming... I drum... because "jouer" is "play". ...and "la batterie" is drums so you really say "play the drums". Very good, Merel. You got 8.8. And Peer as usual got 9.2. Well done. Hey, Merel. We're still in the lead. And we're the best. And Casper the mechanic does great. We're going fast. We nearly fly to the moon. One more time. Look! The ching chang chong boat. I think it's going to the land of Turandot. And there... ...they'll look for princes, but they haven't found any, because it's empty. You want to go? Come on. We're going home. Leave him to me, Merel. Hello son. Sweetheart... You're off? - Yes. There's you swimming bag. With a banana. There's a banana in it. What's today's dive? Back somersault. Difficult... Be careful, Merel. Bye, Casper. Merel, climb out here and don't take too long. Come on. Concentrate... Get out here, the next one is waiting. Raise your knee before diving. Point your toes and arms beside your ears. Go on. Michiel, sorry. I didn't see all your dive, but you ended with a hollow back. Slowly she sat down again in her chair. She looked at this moment more terrifying than ever before. The fires of fury and hatred... ...were smouldering in her small back eyes. "Matilda!" she barked. "Stand up!" "Who me?' Matilda said. "What have I done?" "Stand up, you disgusting little cockroach!" Matilda was startled. She stood up. "I haven't done anything, Mrs Trunchbull" "Honestly! I never saw that slimy thing before!" "Stand up at once, fi Ithy little maggot!" Reluctantly, Matilda got to her feet. She was in the second row. Lavender was behind her... ...feeling a bit guilty. She didn't want to get her friend in trouble, but... But she wasn't about to own up. I think it's okay now. See? It's not okay. Look. That has to be fixed. You're right. There's a ring missing. I don't have one. I'll take it in. Don't worry. Did you manage? So-so. - You have to go. Shall I take Casper? - No, I'll do it. You have enough time? - Yes. Have a good day. - Bye, Daddy. Bye... 'the men will scream and shiver' 'when they see the steel' 'the sword is my best friend' 'heads must roll, they earned it' 'heads must roll, they earned it' Very good. That's going to be perfect. With costumes and swords and everything. Let's do Leila's solo. This is very different, relaxed. Not that fighting spirit, but relaxed, as if in love. Dreamy, sunset-ish... In love, think of the person you love. And listen to this song... listen, listen. She's in the spotlight, it's all about her. 'sun' 'you warm my realm' 'you make all the flowers blossom' 'you colour the roofs gold' Stop for a moment. What did I say? Start again, Joost. The second song. Leila? The judge's friend. Leave me alone, Christ! God, you stink! Shall I read to him then? You're reading Roald Dahl. You like him? My favourite author. He describes everything so precise, but funny too. They call him the author of twisted tales... You never know how his story ends. Don't give it up... ...reading. Because it's very moist in there. Intestines are moist and decay fast. So they must be removed from the body. When they were removed, they were cleaned... ...hung in the sun to dry and oiled with herbs... ...then preserved in a pot. The body was laid in lime. They dug the body up at the right moment and filled the belly with spices... ...and herbs. Okay, guys. I'll only ask you once. Who's being funny? No one? That was it for today. I don't need this. You'll report to me for your next free class. Cow. Let's swim a bit. Very good. Just a little more. I get this one. Here you are. I bet you need this. Now it's my turn. This one... ...and that. Which one? This? This is no good. - It is. Is that all right? Which one do you want? This one? You sure? A teddy bear. Pathetic... You have a message. From Joost... Okay everyone, over here. Put your things on the table... Listen... Quiet. What happened? Leila has broken her leg in two places. That's terrible, of course. A scooter accident... She's in plaster... ...so she can't take part. That also means... ...that we need a new leading role. You know the music and lyrics... ...so it shouldn't be diffi cult. I thought of... Cecelia. Okay. And what we'll do... in fi ve minutes... Put on your costumes in the dressing room and we'll try it. 'sun, you warm my whole realm' 'you make all the flowers blossom' 'you colour the roofs gold' 'you make everyone happy' 'who don't you make me blossom?' 'sun, warm my cold heart' 'sun, warm my cold heart' I thought we mentioned that before... What does STI mean, Martijn? Peer? Thys? Sorry... Yes, Merel? Sexually transmitted infections? You all remember? Sexually transmitted diseases. Name a few? Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and AIDS... - And AIDS... AIDS is best know. The virus is in bodily fluids. Which were they? Freek? Hello Freek? Cindy? No... Samed? I don't know. - Kim? No idea. Peer then? No one? You all took sleeping pills this morning? - Say it. Yes Merel? How can you get infected? I have to go to the toilet. Oh... Go ahead. How can you get infected? Martijn? Eh... Can I go to the toilet too? If you have to... I can't stop you. Don't be long. Help! You must know who did it. Go back to your class. I'll talk to your mentor. Who did it? That cousin... That blond one? I said so! So who was right? - You were. Anna Karenina... Merel? Yes? - You will fi nish it, won't you? Don't go to sleep... Goodnight, sweetheart. Come on out. Great dive. You know what was great about it? You went high, your right angle and line were great... The landing was perfect. There's nothing better. Do it again! The screwdriver is hard. Let me see? - I'll do it. Like that? - That's fine. That's fixed again. You have to go to the toilet? Can you manage, Casper? Merel? - Yes? It's mended. They just called. How soon. - We can come and look. Let's go then. - Just for a look... So soon. Now we're entering the living area. You can tell from the colour? - No... That's not it. Here they can go out into the playground. Or into the woods. Can I ask you something. Any idea how long it will take? Difficult to say. It depends on the child. Rehabilitation is active cooperation. So it all depends on Casper... Surrounded by woods... This is a bedroom for two. Last night a boy fell ill and wanted his mother to stay. Is that allowed? - If it's really necessary. The living room... Cheerful colours... How are you? Having a good time? The kitchen's over there... We cook organic. A local farmer brings fresh vegetables every day. We have organic meat too. And a very important feature for the children... ...the pool. They swim alone? - Or in a group. That depends. Casper, you have to see this. It's fantastic. It's huge! I won't say what. Very relaxing too. What do you think, son? You like it? You know what? Soon you'll walk down the steps by yourself... We'll work on that. We can pick him up on Fridays. We can take the afternoon off, just one of us. Of course we can. It looked great. Nice colours... - Cheerful... And such good equipment. I just hope he doesn't miss us. It'll be all right. Calm down... Feeling better? Let's go to sleep. Night, Daddy. - Sleep tight. Here's your rabbit. Kim, give an example of bullying. Swearing at someone. Gossiping or ignoring them... Sticking gum in her hair. That's more concrete. What else? Hitting someone. - Grabbing their bag. Writing in their diary. Merel, that note on your back... Is that bullying or teasing? That was more like teasing. Teasing? You all think that? - Yes. I don't think the person who did it meant badly. Bullying is always directed at one person. This time it was Merel... But it could happen to me too. Bullying is beating someone up, that's against the law. Violence and breaking things. Vandalism... Let's be clear. Violence, vandalism, breaking things... ...I won't have that in my lessons. And no bullying. Is that clear? Fine... "Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life!" "How can I bear it?" was the first sentence he uttered... ...in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair. Get it? Me neither. But the sentences sound great. He stared at her so earnestly, I thought the intensity of his gaze... ...would bring tears into his eyes. They burnt with anguish, they did not melt. "What now?" said Catherine... ...leaning back, and returning his look with a clouded brow. How are you doing? Are you going to Hook of Holland? Anna Karenina. That's a big jump forward. That book before... It was my brother's. - I see. The opening sentence of the book is very famous. Happy families... ...are all alike. Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Beautiful, isn't it? Merel... That means blackbird. That's a song you know... ...from The Beatles. You know it? You like it? But maybe bluebird suits you better. Bluebird? - Yes, the bluebird of happiness. It's a very strange bird, you don't see it often. But when you see it, it means luck. Did you ever see it? - No. There's a story about it by Maurice Maeterlinck. That's the French word for bluebird. L'oiseau bleu. L'oiseau bleu. Well, that's my boat. Bye-bye, blackbird. - Bye-bye, bluebird. See you. Very high! Good... Get your legs higher. Just stand here. Girls... Listen. If you run up and don't jump on the trampoline, that happens. Merel, you just did very well. Show us again. Just watch... Here she comes. Well done. Back and wait in line. The next. Hey, please do it again. You're so good at it! Well done. Look. I found a nice skateboard. Here, oh dear... It fell... An accident. Sorry! What happened? - Look. She fell. Let me see. - Her lip... ...and her nose... And her skateboard fell in the water. And she was fined for not having a tram ticket. Because she bought a book instead of a ticket. That was an expensive book, girl! Mummy... Shall I go? I'll go. Coming! I bet that hurts. You wanted the book so much? You had to have it. Merel... Come please... What's wrong? - I accidentally... I accidentally wet my bed. Never mind. I'll clean up. Comfortable? - Yes. Wait... Sleep tight. - You too. Can I have a piercing? A piercing? Why? You're twelve! Wait a bit. 121/2 in three days time! Let's start with earrings. Is that an idea? Earrings! - Earrings... How are you? I'm fi ne. Still reading Anna Karenina? How's she doing? Still alive? She just told Vronski that she's... ...pregnant. How did he react? A little nervous... ...but he acted as if... ...he was happy. You think he was happy? - No. And is she happy? Okay, and serious. When I give Joost a signal... ...then we'll all start waving, the climax. You wave the thing... Joost. Here we go. And towards her! On your knees... Here it comes. 'heavenly peace in your realm' 'Turandot' 'everyone listens to your voice' 'Turandot' 'heavenly peace in your realm' Listen. 'a stranger, from a distant land' 'came here to kill my mother ' 'her blood is my blood too' Merel. Stop it, Joost. Come back, Merel. Come back at once. The solo, one more time. 'a stranger, from a distant land' 'came here to kill my mother' 'her blood is my blood too' 'I now avenge that cowardly murder' 'no, no, no one will conquer me' 'and vampires' 'that roam around the room' 'have you ever been to one too' 'to a creepy paltry party' 'the table was nicely laid' 'with pumpkins' 'you didn't believe your eyes' 'ghosts and spiders' Look, a ghost boat. It is a ghost boat... ...with rotting corpses on deck. And skeletons... ...of former slaves. They caught the crew, cut off the sailors' legs... ...and nailed the captain to the mast by his ears. Want to come? - No, I'm... Merel, I'm cold and want to go home. Hey! The ching chang chong boat. - You wanted to go home. That's naughty. Hey, guys... Where have you been? Walking... - Walking? It's much too cold. He likes walking. - He likes walking... Hurry up inside. Merel? Put the wheelchair in the shed. FOR YOUR 121/2TH BIRTHD AY Hans Lodeizen, one of the best Dutch poets. We write that with a "z", not "s"! Merel, where's your test? I haven't seen it. You're sure you handed it in? You did do it? I don't have it. How can that be? You gave it to me? Well, stay behind next time and we'll do it aurally. It'll be all right. Why? She didn't hand it in. I can do that too! Martijn, who's the teacher? - You are, but... Right... They threw it away. Here we are... Witje... - We won't forget the rabbit. Isn't it exciting? Witje... Coming, Merel? - No. See you in a minute. Why did you have to pick him anyway? You knew he'd have to go to an institution. About the sun? 'sun, you warm my realm' 'you make all the flowers blossom' 'you colour the roofs gold' 'you make everyone happy' ...so we wanted a brother or sister for you... ...as well... So we thought... The world is so full... So many children in the world... ...who don't have a right to happiness... Then we saw Casper. We knew he belonged with us. He belongs... ...right? I saw you do it, so I don't know what happened. I've been teaching 35 years. I never lost any tests. Maybe it blew away. I'll write down "8". I don't need to test you. You can go. They only left the two locks. That's all. And no one saw a thing. I don't get it. At school? - From the cycle shed! It's such a nice school... - Real nice. But another bike was stolen. She said so... I phoned the headmaster. - It's only a week old. Go and see her, don't get upset. I'm not angry. It's only a bike. Never mind... I'm out of the musical too. - What? Oh sweetie... You rehearsed so hard. 173 schools took part nationwide. Today the result was announced. A school from Zaandam came third. Second prize went to a school in Maastricht. And a certain school in Rotterdam came fi rst! On behalf of the whole staff, I want to say we're very proud of you. As for the prize... The first prize is 20,000 euro. 'heavenly peace in your realm' 'Turandot' 'everyone listens to your voice' 'Turandot' 'heavenly peace in your realm' 'a stranger, from a distant land' 'came here to kill my mother' 'her blood is my blood too' 'I now avenge that cowardly murder' 'no, no, no one will conquer me' Don't touch him. Should we call your parents? - No. You're sure? Did your brother swim too long? He's not my brother. Mummy! There you are. I was looking for you. I've got something for you. Thank you. L'oiseau bleu. You like it? Wait. For my bluebird... Martijn... - Catch. I want to know who started it. Tell me now. You may leave, Merel. Fine... Next week you're all in detention. You won't get away with this. See you tomorrow. First is Nicky Hullen of Aquamarine with 268 points. And the Special Incentive Award has been won by... ...Merel de Leeuw of the Dolphins!
