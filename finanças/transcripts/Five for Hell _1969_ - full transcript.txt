Al Siracusa. Nick Amadori! McCarthy. Go to hell! Who is John White? It's me. He doesn't have the necessary score. Hey Cochran! - Hey! - Throw the ball here! - Now he's got the score he needs, Sergeant. - Lieutenants! Show them what you've got! Come on! FIVE FOR HELL Gentlemen, what you have seen must not be repeated. We're still blocked at the foot of the Gustav Line. And we also know why! Because of poorly managed and insufficient forces. Nevertheless, the order is to spare the lives of our soldiers as much as possible. The worst is yet to come. 50,000 of our men could fall into a deadly trap... ...if we don't get to the Plan K that the Führer is preparing. Many German divisions will join those of Kesselring... ...which are already at the front. But where and when does this happen? It is important to find out. Major Thompson, where are we on the training program? It was completed with optimal results and earlier than expected. This favours the operation to neutralise Plan K. Down! It's your crew's turn, Captain. This is an opportune moment. Let's go. Sergeant! I've decided: my squad will take care of the safe. Lieutenant Hoffman will disagree. Go! It's complete. I'll take care of it. Let's build it. take that boy Hey! I'll open. Hey Hoffmann, I'm still here too. How's it going? It's a '38 Wertheim model. It's pretty hard to crack. - But Al can handle it, right? - That's really hard! Crap! What does that mean? That's what my grandpa always said when he was stressed. - There we go... - Bugger! You have to make it, Siracusa. You have to do it, there are only a few seconds left. Gentlemen. Lieutenant Hoffmann, the information applies to both squads. Your methods are unusual, to say the least. You could say they don't fit the mould at all. Lieutenant Hoffmann, you gave us a good beating... The practice ammunition and the bayonets were not used that way... ... as the regulation provides. The end justifies the means. The test is over, boys. Congratulations, Lieutenant. I think that's appropriate, gentlemen, even if he chose an incompetent. Your Siracusa didn't manage to get the safe open. Excellent work, damn it! Lieutenant Hoffman... Report to Major Thompson in the morning. Captain Nixon. Yes, sir? - How did that happen? - An unidentified flying object... Nice throw, Captain. In which team did you play? Only the success of your mission, Lieutenant Hoffmann... ...gives us the opportunity to set up an adequate line of defence. This is how we avoid 50,000 of our men being killed. A German hospital nurse... ... Helga Richter, our informant, reported us... ... that the plans of the German attack will be in the vault of Villa Verde. And next week. The safe is made by Wertheim. Your expert managed to get an identical one in the test. Let's hope the best. It's all planned. You'll meet Helga Richter in St. Marcellus Church, right here. Next Saturday at 18:00. It's General Friedrich's birthday. He is in charge of the command of Villa Verde. According to our informant, this is the man to watch out for: SS Colonel Hans Müller. Good morning. Good morning. Well done, Axel. Good, Todd. Point. And that will serve to increase the prestige of the Third Reich. Around the world. The Third Reich... ... big, powerful... ... invincible. Luckily we have our Kesselring. Good luck general. Heil Hitler! Unhurt! We executed 108 partisans in 15 days. Exactly three times as much as Major Kassel in the three months of his stay. - 108! - That's right, Standartenführer. But we will never succeed in suppressing the partisan resistance. We'll kill thousands of them, General. The well-being of a people is shown by the preponderance of coffins over cradles. A Physiocratic Law. I'm already thinking about the next one I eliminate. Another partisan: Francesco Braguglia. This is the most delicate moment of my work. It's time to execute Plan K, General. I am informed about that. Heil Hitler! Unhurt! I was waiting for you last night. - That was the third time. - Forgive me. - I've been very busy, Standartenführer. - Well, then tonight? This will be difficult, Standartenführer. I'm sorry. Hey Al, try this. No... You there... Do you want to dance with me, buddy? You don't want to? OK. Damn shirts! They're probably not made for monkeys. OK, stop that! Sergeant, I have news. So as not to alarm the boys, let's talk in German, McCarthy. We're starting to rust. - What does he say? - How should I know? Why do you even speak in German? We're leaving, boys. To Villa Verde. Nothing special. It is the residence of the German Southern Command. What are you pulling faces? It's not hell, is it, Lieutenant? Among other things, we have to crack a safe. Almost identical to the one in the test: A 1938 Wertheim model. Well, I was tricked. Would I have w... A Chicago guy blew up while breaking into a Wertheim vault. - What nonsense. - I'm not joking. I got it from the newspaper. Well, ours won't blow up, and besides... ... with a bit of luck you can enrich yourself by cracking open a safe. When does it start? Tonight. An aeroplane takes us over the Gustav Line. How? Don't we have time to prepare? I've thought of everything. I'll be expecting you at the camp in 15 minutes. By the way, McCarthy, what about that one thing? A masterpiece. I saw you coming. Why at this time? You look very worried. May I ask what's going on, Helga? You've been spotted, Braguglia. Müller knows everything. You don't have to worry about yourself. Because I won't talk. I know. But you have to get away from here. I want Braguglia alive. Surrounds the area. Hello. what did you bring me I get it. But what about the promised steaks? "What did you bring? What did you bring?'' - You Italians are all the same. - You come here anyway. - You'll like something. - How was it? You are hungry... Long live Germany. Thank god we're here. Tell me, is this yours? That's the one next to the brown one. Boys wear uniforms these days. I'll get you one. Elke, General Birthday would like to speak to you. - Bring him this, please. - Gladly. You killed Francesco Braguglia, right? I don't even know this Francesco Braguglia! Ask Helga. ask her, she knows me! I'm not a partisan! I'm not a spy! I'm a pimp! Do you understand? I'm a pimp! A pimp! Hey, what are you doing? Don't you hear me? Don't you hear me? Hey! Hey! Finally alone. Get up and go. - Repeat that. - Get out of here! I brought you a present. A pity. Then another time. Good morning, Miss. Good morning - Why this face? - He greeted me. Sergeant. I see vehicles down there. What did he say? that you are a monkey Get her out of here! - What are you doing? run! - Wait! I didn't see you! Emergency level one! Al, go with Johnny. emergency level two. - Darn! - What's the matter? Out of petrol. We continue on foot. Hurry up! Give them to me. Rocco! They are coming. Let's go! Hey Americans! Bugger! Go away. Man, you're a pain in the ass! Do you have a heavy head, Johnny? - No, Lieutenant. - Would you like a piece, pants shit? Stop that! She really has it in for me. Away with it! What a pig luck... Let's get out of here. We have to wait for sunset to meet up with Helga Richter. Yes, of course. - Plan K has been suspended. - Right decision! With all the partisans and spies that are out and about. But there are also too many executions ordered in cold blood! I don't know of any other methods, General Birthday. Heil Hitler. Johnny worries me. Johnny. The glasses. pray for us Pray for... What about you? Don't you pray? These Germans are also children of a mother. Let me go! You've been keeping me in here for over an hour! And don't look at me like that! Be careful, Müller. I can't take you any more! Why won't you tell me who's expecting you? I've had enough now. I'm going to the General's birthday. If I were you I wouldn't do this. The spy Francesco Braguglia was killed with this pistol. Unusual. The gun was found in your lover's house. I have to report back. Unless... I... I wonder why we didn't wait for Helga. Now come on, don't be so hard on yourself, White. Now I feel better. At least they won't shoot us with the clothes. - Sergeant, we'll make everything go away. - I'm fine. Let's go, bloody pants. Sergeant, can you hear me? How is the reception? answer. Over. The reception is perfect. Over. Three minutes to reach the north side. I'll get back to you later. - Receive. - Three minutes? He thinks we're 100 metre sprinters. Are you on the line, McCarthy? Open your ears. They make a change of guards at the outposts. The next change is at five. I see, Lieutenant. We have to make it in five hours. McCarthy. How many posts? Lieutenant, there are seven guards around the mansion. But where we are, only one. Don't move from there. I come to you. Over and out. Let's go. - Well, Sergeant? - A machine gun in the middle of the clearing. And a guard on the long balcony. 25 seconds. Johnny, you go with McCarthy. Al and Nick. Emergency level three. I think that's the right distance, huh, Nick? - Good this way? - Continue up. That's okay. Go! - It was so easy on the test. - Oh, are you going to start that again? This is a high voltage fence and the foundation is concrete. That's about 20 feet, Nick. You can't do it without touching him. I'll try anyway. He's got it, Lieutenant. Keep calm Johnny. Just keep it quiet, Sergeant. I'll take care of that. Always calm. This is the freight elevator. Go on, pants shit. And don't make noise. I wonder why we took him with us. Because he's the best demolitions expert our unit has had. Any objections? Turn on the light. - What do you have? - Grumpy noise, huh? Be quiet now. Let's have something else, Al. It could be the last time. Here so you have something in your pants. - You know what's really important to me? - That you have to open the safe. - That's fine. - Hey! - Here is a staircase. - The freight elevator. - Might be useful. - It's the best way. The lieutenant decides. So what should we do? Nick, I'm going to go see. Wait for me here. Plan K. Death Squad Panther Leap. Come in. - Where are the others? - In the basement. I took a big risk waiting for you here. Müller suspects me. That's why I wasn't in church. Doesn't he have you guarded? You don't know me. I have a lot in stock. The plans? They're in the vault. We need to get it open before the next changing of the guard. - I have to hurry. - One moment. If someone tries to open the safe at night... ... an alarm sounds in Müller's room. I found that out yesterday. Do you take care of the safe? I'll take care of disabling the alarm. I'll go with you. I'll wait in the basement then. Yes understood. Good luck. I wasn't expecting you, Helga. We need to take down the guard on the balcony... ... if we want to work in peace. That's the only option. You then take his place. No, not them. Take it easy, Al. Think of the guy from Chicago. Boom! Emergency level two. Johnny, go with him. So? - Keep going. - Some patience. Nick. Everything OK outside. So Al? It's almost sunrise. This part is difficult to crack. Crap! What does that mean? You fool. Watch out, it's almost done. Come here. Hey, did you see? No boom. That guy from Chicago just screwed it up. Be quiet! The lamp. Switch it off. Someone is coming. Let's get him away. The negatives of Plan K are safe. That's a really good idea, Lieutenant. Al. - Nice throw, Lieutenant. - It's all up to Nick now. I'll leave you alone, pants shit. be honourable. Quick, now we're all stuck. Crap! Fast! McCarthy's in trouble! We're up to our necks in it. Comes with. Hey you herb eaters! Keep calm. Calm down! Be nice and calm. - McCarthy, shh! - Yes, of course. McCarthy, kick down this door. Come on Lieutenant! - Take McCarthy to the shed. - What? - I'll cover you. - Are you crazy? Siracusa, come back! Come on, over there. Hey you herb eaters! How many are you? How many are you? Where are the others? Hurry up, I want to see them all blow up together. Come on! Amadori! Go away. Drop the gun! The gun! The soldier will not be able to escape. Your sacrifice is in vain. I am your prisoner. - And you can't kill a prisoner. - Unless he tries to escape. Go, run! Run towards the fence! I said, "Run." You're a fucking son of a bitch! And under the ancient arches of Rome marched tens of thousands of those soldiers... ... who never found out that they lost their lives to 5 commando troop members... ... as well as a baseball, This story is taken from the war archives of the Italy campaign. I know, Nick. But this is war. THE END
